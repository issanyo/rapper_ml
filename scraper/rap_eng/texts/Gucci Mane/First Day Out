I'm starting off my day with a blunt of purp
No pancakes just a cup of syrup
Baking soda, pot, and a silver spork
You already know it's time to go to work
I'm back up in the kitchen working with a chicken
You get 63 grams for like $1250
50 pounds of purp, 50 pounds of midgy
As soon as it's gone I sell another 60
My baby need some shoes, my aunty need a purse
Summer coming real soon so I need a vert
I hop up out that van with that duffle bag
And if a nigga try me I'ma bust his ass
I'm counting up money in the living room
Birds everywhere I call it the chicken room
Pills in the cabinet, pounds in the den
Attic full of guns, basement full of Benjamins
Two AK-47s and a blow torch
Couple junkies knocking hard on my front porch
A couple old schools in my back yard
If I don't know ya I'm a serve you through my burglar bars
Gucci back bitch, Yea I'm back bitch
Did you miss me or miss my raps bitch?
This that new shit, that county jail shit
That seventh floor Rice Street straight out a cell shit
You on my shit list, I'm on the Forbes list
Since I'm a rich nigga, I need a rich bitch
I gotta sick wrist it cost bout six bricks
I'm on that slick shit, that zone 6 shit
