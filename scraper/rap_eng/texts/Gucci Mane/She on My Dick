[Intro: Rick Ross]
Who at the door? Put the money up
I'ma been done kilt one of these niggas 'round here, man
Who dat is? Uhhhhh

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I had to wet the donkey, get some pillow seats (huh)
Pork n' bean projects is where the killers be (woo)
Can't be talkin' all loud or niggas gettin' shot
Homicide, died in the line of hip hop
All my niggas out the scott let the wicks lock (huh)
Swear to God, I'ma die for this wristwatch
Growin' up at risco, they called us piss poor
Realest nigga in the city, let a bitch know (woo)
Red bottoms, all white just to shoot dice (huh)
Rick Brown leave ya, do it like I'm Big Mike (huh)
Jabar home, goin' on his fifth Rolls Royce
I drop the top and let him wave at the dope boys (woo)
Fake golds, niggas front with these Dracos (fuck 'em)
Walk up on 'em with the forty and the case closed (woo)
Double M the label with the most pesos (woo)
I bought a condo and that bitch got eight floors (woo)

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
Richest nigga in the city so she on my dick (boss, woo)
It make sense, she on my dick (woo)
Makin' moves in the city so she on my dick
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
I'm makin' moves, she on my dick

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I get a rush when I see these bitches watchin' me
It's like a high when I see these bitches jockin' me
She on my dick like she heard what I'm orderin'
Drop top Mulsanne, it's just one of these
She on my dick like she seen some' she shouldn't've seen
Two hundred thou', one hundred's crammed in my Givenchy jeans
And she just wanna make a scene, tryna join the team
And I just wanna paint her face like it's Maybelline
Bill Belichick, I just got another ring (ring)
Bust another check and I just bought a new machine (huh)
And like the Chargers I'm about to move the team (go)
You bought a Charger, well Gucci bought a Lamborghin' (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
She on my dick, she on my dick (boss, woo)
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
Richest nigga in the city, she on my dick
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
She see my moves, she on my dick (woo)
The richest nigga, yeah, she on my dick

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Baby girl, do your thing in your Vera Wang (huh)
Ever dealt with a nigga still dealin' cocaine? (huh)
Never made it to the game before it's halftime (no)
Ten stacks for the seats, so you can have mine (haha)
Never seated by a snitch, they give me bad vibes (woo)
Pop a bottle every time you niggas flatline (bang)
Lot of bitches but I focus on my Fab Five (uh)
Made her count a half a ticket on the cab ride (woo)
Bitch hair nappy girl, you need that rich shit (huh)
It take real heart to wanna be a rich bitch
She was the youngest and her mama had six kids
Called her a dummy but she turned into a rich bitch (haha)
Run with a nigga with some money out in Memphis (I see)
She was postin' pics of the gifts that he would gift her (I see)
But the pussy goes to the richest nigga (I see)
And guess what? Rozay is that nigga!

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
She on my dick, she on my dick (boss, woo)
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
Richest nigga in the city, she on my dick
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
She on my dick, she on my dick (woo)
She see my moves, she on my dick (woo)
The richest nigga, yeah, she on my dick
Whoo! Whooo!
