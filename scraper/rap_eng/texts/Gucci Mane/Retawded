[Intro: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci, hah
It's Wizzop

[Pre-Chorus: Damar Jackson]
I was 'bout to do my own thing, hit the Circle K and just ride out
Played this ready, tree rolled up, got it on me, finna vibe out
Thought about her low key, should I fuck her 'fore I leave?
Turn to Martin Luther King, gotta let me know now

[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
Girl that pussy retarded, girl that pussy retarded
Swear to God that pussy retarded
I'm a dog, I'm fuckin' regardless
Girl look what you started, yeah that pussy be fartin'
Girl you know that pussy retarded
Her panties off when she callin'

[Verse 1: Damar Jackson]
Brrt brrt brrt, girl that's dick on your line
Baby or bitch to get nasty one time
Take this dick like your life's on the line
Don't let these rappers hit 'cause that pussy is mine
You know I be with it on sight
That pussy be treating me right
Play with that pussy, a nigga might die
I'm fuckin' that pussy for life
Bitch I blow your back out, I'll pull your tracks out
I want that pussy like bitch where you at now?

[Pre-Chorus: Damar Jackson]
I was 'bout to do my own thing, hit the Circle K and just ride out
Played this ready, tree rolled up, got it on me, finna vibe out
Thought about her low key, should I fuck her 'fore I leave?
Turn to Martin Luther King, gotta let me know now

[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
Girl that pussy retarded, girl that pussy retarded
Swear to God that pussy retarded
I'm a dog, I'm fuckin' regardless
Girl look what you started, yeah that pussy be fartin'
Girl you know that pussy retarded
Her panties off when she callin'

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Drop top McLaren, everybody lookin'
Since I came home, everybody bookin'
Quarter million for a show, that's retarded money
Retarded diamonds in my watch, my wrist is super dummy
Shawty real smart, with a retarded booty
Please tell your man to fall back, that boy a super groupie
I might just pull up Club Crucial in some' super foolish
Playin' Shawty Lo and rockin' stupid jewelry
Retard tennis chain, and my earring
I make a chick go stupid and call me my real name
They call me Glacier Gucci, they made my life a movie
'Cause every night a movie, who got more ice than Gucci?

[Pre-Chorus: Damar Jackson]
I was 'bout to do my own thing, hit the Circle K and just ride out
Played this ready, tree rolled up, got it on me, finna vibe out
Thought about her low key, should I fuck her 'fore I leave?
Turn to Martin Luther King, gotta let me know now

[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
Girl that pussy retarded, girl that pussy retarded
Swear to God that pussy retarded
I'm a dog, I'm fuckin' regardless
Girl look what you started, yeah that pussy be fartin'
Girl you know that pussy retarded
Her panties off when she callin'

[Verse 3: Damar Jackson]
That pussy retarded baby, it come with low mileage baby
I bet you I'm all in baby, hop in that pussy like Tarzan baby
And you fuckin' them all lately, and I'm out of town lately
But a nigga just landed and I'm back in the club again
Two hundred bands, all on the stage
All on my chain, I know they hate me
You doing your thing, we only fuck, we on the same page
I had to pull out, dick in her mouth, she can't have my last name
That pussy retarded, dick on target, sex is insane

[Pre-Chorus: Damar Jackson]
I was 'bout to do my own thing, hit the Circle K and just ride out
Played this ready, tree rolled up, got it on me, finna vibe out
Thought about her low key, should I fuck her 'fore I leave?
Turn to Martin Luther King, gotta let me know now

[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
Girl that pussy retarded, girl that pussy retarded
Swear to God that pussy retarded
I'm a dog, I'm fuckin' regardless
Girl look what you started, yeah that pussy be fartin'
Girl you know that pussy retarded
Her panties off when she callin'
