[Chorus: Sasha Sloan]
All of my friends are settling down
They're only kids but they're married now
Let's follow the lights
Let's follow the crowd
Baby we got to get out
Let's get out of this town

[Verse 1: Sasha Sloan]
I want an ocean view, somewhere
As long as I'm next to you, I don't care
I don't wanna live my life in circles
I just wanna find an empty road
Let's get away from here, let's go

[Chorus: Sasha Sloan]
All of my friends are settling down
They're only kids but they're married now
Let's follow the lights
Let's follow the crowd
Baby we got to get out
Let's get out of this town

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
(Ah, Kygo)
I'm Gucci Mane, the champion
I'm battling for the title (huh?)
I got women say they love me
I'm an American idol (wow)
I don't like the practice quarter
Million for recital
I got fans all over in Africa
Awaiting my arrival
Five million, just don't diamonds
I call that a bridal shower
300k an hour and is really giving me power (power)
Do I really love my, uh (what?)
Or do I love her body? (Yah)
Do she really love me? (Huh)
Or do she love my money?
It's Gucci! (Gucci)

[Chorus: Sasha Sloan]
All of my friends are settling down
They're only kids but they're married now
Let's follow the lights
Let's follow the crowd
Baby we got to get out
Let's get out of this town

[Outro: Sasha Sloan]
Let's get out of this town
Let's get out of this town
Let's get out of this town
Let's get out of this town
Let's get out of this town
Let's get out of this town
