Verse 1 (Gucci Mane)
Girl You My Type You Just Right
That Blouse On You Fit Just Right
Them Jeans She Got On Skin Tight
Shes Sexy Cool But Still Shy
I'm Colder Than A Klondike
Bipolar I Got Dumb Ice
We Know Each Other We Go Together
Like Hamburgers And French Fries
Everything Is All Right
Well Never Have A Fist Fight
But Last Night Had A Sex Fight
Then Told Her Have A Blessed Night
I'm Leaning I'm Meanin
I Fall Asleep And Might Have Dreams In It
Did The Club And Bring My Team In It
Now Tonight I'ma Bring My Queen In
I Go Get It You Push Hitters
I Hit It Damn Right That Kid Did It
You Hood Critics And Hood Chickens
Please Try To Stay Out My Bizness
From South France To South Philly
ATL To North Memphis
From My City To Your City
Think You Got More Swag But Not Really

I Met You Girl Everything Was Alllllllright

Like I Remember The Time Girl

Verse 2 (Gucci Mane)
Yo Yo Yo
Ima Put It Down So Gucci Gon' Wake Up So
I Run It Its Gon' Hurt But When Im Gone Its Gonna Make You want More
Scented Aura Candels I Pull Up In My Lambo
The Bestest That You Never Had Two Backstreets Off The Main Road
You Had It But You Left So Thats Just The Game Go
No One On My Level So Please Get Up Out My Lane Hoe
I Met A Girl So Real That Theres No Need To Put No Game On
Reminicising Gucci Everytime They Play My Same Song
Im On Her Like A long John Short Skirt With No Thong On
Sexy Naked Sunbathing Outside My House With Frames On
I Took Her From Some Buster And That Boy Ain't Gon' Do Shit About it
Its Alright If We Can Get It Tell That Sucka Forget About it

Bridge (Ray J)
Girls To My Right Ladies To My Left
Weathers Real Hot Snows On My Chest
When I Seen This Fly Girl Tried To Get Her Number
Then She Tells Me I Already Smashed Last Summer (Remember?)
Mile High Club G5 Planes

Mile High Club G5 Planes
Remember Back Rubs And Pink Champagne
