[Intro: Gucci Mane & Deuce]
Yeah, (Uhhh Huhhh)
It’s Gucci, (Deuce)
Wassup baby, (Yeah)

Yellow lams, yellow MP's (remix), yellow watch, yellow charm, ring (Deuce), chain
Yellow living room set (& Gucci)
Lemonade Gucci shoes for my girl, it’s Gucci (Get em)
Gucci

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My Phantom sitting on sixes, no twenties in my denim
Your Cutlass motor knocking because it is a lemon
I like them Georgia peaches but you look more like a lemon
These sour apple bitter bitches I'm not fucking with em
I'm truly stupid paid, that's just how I feel today
I'm moving slow cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade
I'm standing in the shade and I'm selling lemonade
Six hundred a pint, the going rate off in the A
Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in your face
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday
I'm pimpin' wearing linen, that's just how I'm chillin'
I'm smoking grits and selling chickens
Corvette painted lemon
(Gucci)

[Hook]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts (x2)
Lemonade in shade with my feet up (x2)
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup (x2)
Lemons in their face, watch em freeze up (x2)

[Verse 2: Deuce]
What's Gucci Baby, for lemon chicks, Deuce is crazy
A pimp produced in the 80's, soo real but cool with the ladies
My freshness is stupid daily, flow cold as a scoop of Bailey's
As soon as this music pay me, gon' lemon-juice a Mercedes
Midwest influenced me greatly, that's basically who I'm spittin' for
They know Deuce what the name is, but dont mistake him for Bigalow
Shootin', bumpin' "So Fly" with Don Juan, what they hittin' for
Bringin' fame to my squad, like Harry Potter & Gryffindor
Niggas know that it's Southside 'till the day I die, same thang everyday I'm fly
Inside-out, outside-in, even when I'm dead & out my skin
Feel like I was never gone, swear I'm with a yellow-bone
Cruisin' to this yellow song, while haters park like yellowstone
(Deuce)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Lemonade my townhouse in Miami I want yellow carpet
Woke up in the morning, fuck it, bought a yellow Aston Martin
Yellow bricks, yellow dust, yellow lean, yellow tuss
Yellow pills, spinning wheels, yellow weed, re-up with us
Coward ass nigga, yellow stripe, you a yellowback
AK hit your dog, and you can't bring Old Yeller back
Yep, Gucci bring up eighty thousand: that's a yellow fact
Yellow homes, mellow homes, you know you's a scary-cat
No sleep for two days, so my pupils lookin' yellow
Five flights, six shows, quarter-million on my schedule
Bangladesh and Gucci Mane, niggas know they in trouble
Green ice, red light. Caution, Gucci rocks yellow
