[Verse 1: BIG D]
Trappin' through the snow roof
With the rainbow drangs
And I got an AK40
With the Draco bang
I'm Soulja Boy
I got my Draco
I got my MP4
I come with that M18
And you trash
I shoot you with my gun
A duh duh duh duh duh
A wee wee wee wee wee
Hee hee hee hee hee
A tin tin tin tin tin
[Verse 2: BIG D]
I got my cheeseburgers
And I got some ramen noodles
With that kids meal
I got a eight piece chicken nugget
No girl you can't get none
Cause you
Shut up! Please Shut Up!
