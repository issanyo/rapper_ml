[Hook: Young Dolph]
HOLIDAY SEASONN!

Black Diamonds Black [?] Straight Thugging
15 years old I started Hustling
Remain a real nigga till I die man it's nothing
If you ain't working with a million you can't tell me nothing
Turned nothing into something
I Turned nothing into something
If you ain't working with a million you can't tell me nothing
Naaa you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
If you  ain't work for tiggy I don't wanna talk
I keep a yawk on me that's that Memphis talk
I never take a hoe to my spot cause these bitches talk
They send a nigga to my crib you get outlined in Chalk
No sympathy for these bitches no love for these niggas Fuck em!
You live with paying all her bills but she love me, nigga. Hahaha!
Like a porn star how she fucks me
I ain't going to lie I felt guilty, cause that the momma of your children
Rolling
Roll one up
Pour me a cup
Pee-wee ass niggas don't like me but guess what I don't give a fuck
I drank syrup till I get stuck
On the phone with my Plug talking big bucks

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]

Broke niggas laughing but they funny bruh

Your stupid ass sleeping on my furniture
RIP, but my pockets are big punishers

Multi million who the fuck you calling country bruh
I lost it all got back up and brought my money up
It seems like yesterday when I bought my first hummer truck
Don't walk up pull up back to back now back tour buses
Fuck a show slamming pounds on my tour buses
He such a greedy [?] that she too bust it
If you a boss bitch then why the fuck you shooting wop
