This that arm on my kush shit
My girlfriend think she president bush bitch
Hell yeah, and I'm gon' off that lean shit
My brotha' duke keep on sendin' me that green shit
Fuck jail Gucci time, and I'm hoodrich
I'm in that zone 6, and I throw it like the first pitch
My yellow 'rarri, in the front and I parked it
A black chick in some heels match the carpet
I'm pullin' up to the club like I own it
Ain't with that bullshit, Gucci don't condone it
My tolerance get low with the flexin'
I woke up bought my main chick a Lexus

I be the bricksquad youngin'
Stankin' like a funyan
All these otha' rap niggas, toed like a bunyan
I'm B-S and you B-S
But I'm Brick Squad and you bullshit
Pistol like a chapporone
We goin' on a school trip
Places that you neva' seen
Blowin on that stupid green
Rollin on a stupid beam
Hit the scene in limousine
Codeine and promethazine
Diamonds I'm my pinky ring
Nigga what the fuck you mean
Brick Squad dream team
I got money to blow, naw I ain't drizzy
Money make the world go round, that's why I'm dizzy
Standin behind Gucci, Flock, the like who is it
Slim Dunkin in this mothafucka'
Cut the chizzy

Thousand bags of that mid shit (hell yeah)
This that shit that get yo kidz rich (hell yeah)

It's big Gucci, excuse me while I ball
Until my release, my nigga, no lights out
Lights out, creep on in silence
Why do I pull more violence
When unviolent
While my tattoos smilin'
To remind me of the time they robbed me, with no problem
Now my problems solved, and they revolvin' around all these continents
And my company, stretch from here to Compton, to Bouldercrest
?
That's something to those who have nothin'
No bluffin' bricksqaud no cuffin'

Thousand bags of that mid shit (hell yeah)
This that shit that get yo kidz rich (hell yeah)
Hundred bags of that kush shit (hell yeah)
This that president bush shit (hell yeah)
