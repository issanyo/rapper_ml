[Intro: Gucci Mane]
What's happenin'?
Griiim
(burr burr)
And Gucci!

[Chorus: Evander Griiim]
(Yuh)
Right now
C'mon baby, bust it open, right now
Throw the cash, all I want it, right now
All the pussy, all the fame, right now

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Ayy, right now
I just made three hundred thousand, right now
I just pulled off in that thang, bam bam
Batmobile, made a steal
Ain't no rappers real, as me
Young ass nigga giving dick to the widows
Louis V blanket with the Hermes pillow
Thick booty clap back just like jello
Shoot like Melo, boom like Metro
Uh, yeah, right now
Clear this whole section out, right now
Buy your house off section eight, right now
Put you in that big estate, right now
Bitch better get some manners
Fuck college and the grammar
And the mathematics and the history, uh
All a young nigga need to know is how to keep the Franklins on me, uh yeah

[Chorus: Evander Griiim]
Right now
C'mon baby, bust it open, right now (damn)
Throw the cash, all I want it, right now (bust it)
All the pussy, all the fame, right now
All the love, all the fame, right now (skrr)
C'mon baby, bust it open, right now
Throw the cash, all I want it, right now
All the pussy, all the fame, right now
Right now

[Verse 1: Evander Griiim]
Niggas try to ride my wave but can't swim
Nigga you be chewing too, too much
Got a foreign in my foreign, and she snorin'
Little nigga I'm the GOAT, 'bout to trip it (woo)
Eski-eski-eskimo, I'm so cold (damn!)
Ride around with my neck, and my wrist
On froze, nigga gold, all gold
All gold, all the hoes, all the drip
Poppin' pussy, nigga woah, with my gold
Nigga tax me I'ma flip, with my thumb
Poppin' pussy with my thumb, with my thumb, right
Right now
Throw it baby, bust it open, right now (damn)
All I wanted was a ten and a four
All I get it for the low, for the low
Hit that nigga, I'm the plug, right now
Send that nigga with the bugs, right now
All my bitches kiss bitches, and they wealthy
And they suckin' for the selfie
I'm so petty, oh so petty
Oh shit, hot shit, I'm that nigga since
Eighth grade, poppin' shit in the hallways
Yellin' dope, hella dope, this the new me
Suckin', signing, double D's, overseas

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
(Huh)
Just got off the stage, I need thirty bitches right now
I'm so piped up, ain't no way that I can pipe down (nah)
The way I lay that pipe down she say that she my wife now
But I just want a good suck up and a decent wipe down
Slidin', leather seats reclinin'
Blinding with expensive diamonds (burr!)
Rolex with exquisite timing
Dining on exotic islands
Grinding like I'm nickel'n'diming
I'm the king of Ace of Diamonds
Got her eatin' up all this flavor
My lean eating up my stomach lining
I can spend five hundred thousand now and get it right back (wow)
Say he want to be like Gucci Mane, he on the right track (yeah)
Got a lil young ho that hittin' it, say she coming right back (mwah)
Keep her up all night and eyes both wide just like a night owl
(Gucci!)

[Chorus: Evander Griiim]
Right now
C'mon baby, bust it open, right now (damn)
Throw the cash, all I want it, right now (bust it)
All the pussy, all the fame, right now
All the love, all the fame, right now (skrr)
C'mon baby, bust it open, right now
Throw the cash, all I want it, right now
All the pussy, all the fame, right now
Right now
