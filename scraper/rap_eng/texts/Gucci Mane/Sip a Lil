[Intro: Gucci Mane]
CashMoneyAP
Tyga, Wop, burr
Ooh, BatGang on the track, bitch

[Chorus: Tyga & (Gucci Mane)]
Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil
Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more (Wop)
Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil
Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more

[Post-Chorus: Tyga]
Baby, when the lights are low and the night is warm
You like it slow, I used to rush to you
Baby, when the rain pours down
Reminds me of touchin' you

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Baby, when I'm out and the pill hit
I start to feel shit, shit I used to feel when you still here
Sometimes I roll over like you still there
I been rollin' for a week and I'm still lit
Got a baby for my body high, baby for my head high
Got a lil baby for my bedtime
Got a lil baby come through in the AM for the cereal
My boutique lil baby got more poochie than Emilio
No, no, I don't think they feel me though
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm a miracle
You know when I sip a lil, I might send a missle
Hit you with that tongue emoji, wanna lick that
I be on a mission, yeah, I know you see the vision, yeah
Still wanna see me, got me feelin' like I need you when

[Chorus: Tyga & (Gucci Mane)]
When I sip a lil, I miss you a lil
Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more (Wop)
Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil
Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more (go, go, go)

[Post-Chorus: Tyga & (Gucci Mane)]
Baby, when the lights are low and the night is warm
You like it slow, I used to rush to you
Baby, when the rain pours down
Reminds me of touchin' you (Wop)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
She just wants some closure, my thing out is suicidal
I bet she hear this song and think of Guwop inside her
Drop top with my top open, her heart broken, I'm liable
My ambition as a rider, is all about survival
Glacier blue McLaren and I drive it like MacGyver
Got so many Burkin bags, that bitch can't make her mind up
I'm the owner but I'm coach and play, I just might change the line up
Too bad he wanna be with Gucci gang, I won't let him sign up
Bigger, bigger diamonds got 'em lost in the sauce
Yeah, you crossed the line like the stones in the cross
I was on the boss, now I'm boss of the boss
And I just crack a smile 'cause you done, stick a fork

[Chorus: Tyga & (Gucci Mane)]
Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil (Gucci)
Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more
Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil
Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more

[Verse 3: Tyga]
And the vibe don't lie, I hear what you sayin'
But the vide don't lie, I'm where you wanna be layin' at
Who you playin' with? I'm not a toy thing
I'm a man, I'm not your boyfriend, I boost off the poison
Sip a lil, mix a lil, twist a lil, kiss a lil
We lick a lil, just a lil but this ain't lil (this ain't lil)
I was tryna call you
All summer, tryna fall through, I hit you like where are you?

[Chorus: Tyga]
When I sip a lil, I miss you a lil
Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more
Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil
Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more
