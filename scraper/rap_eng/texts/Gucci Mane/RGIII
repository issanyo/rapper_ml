[Hook]
Yellow diamonds, red cars (RG III)
My plug just sent a long bomb (RG III, RG III)
RG III, I’m on the run (RG III, RG III)
I’m a young nigga with plenty money
(RG III, RG III)

[Verse1: Gucci Mane]
Touchdown with it, RG III
Scramble with the work, nigga RG III
RG III in the trap with me, I’m the quarterback, nigga and I break down D
Get your 3D glasses ’cause I’m RG III
Already all PG 13
Drinking Louie XIII and watch ‘em train DC
And my whole team eatin’ I’m the MVP
Ran off on the plug, had to use my feet
Quarterback draw, got a strap on me
Never say that you got burners for me
All of my soldiers get dirty for me
4th and a inch, short by a brick
First we locked up but then Scooter got pinched
The pocket collapse cuz them niggas done blitzed
Double the profit, quadruple the risk
RG III, RG III
RG III, I’m RG III
Too quick, got a get rich quick scheme
Showtime getting close, rough bring the chain
Can’t carjack me like Bobby V
Got a RV full of nothing but RG III
In a drop head Rolls told my TOP
To RIP cuz I’m RG III
Dipped her in gold so she DIG
Ball in the streets like I play in the league
Fumbled the bitch could've passed her to me
Don’t go to the cops, I hold court in the street
Michael Vick money, I bury a beast
50 chains going, don’t cherish a piece
Got clean, I got glass, I got lean, I got swag
Ridin' through zone 6 bout to pick up a sack
