[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
A nigga so fly that I should have been a pilot
I know a nigga rap but I could have been a stylist
Feel like a jeweler 'cause I rock so many diamonds (bling)
Could never run for president, my past too violent
Fam so broke that I had to start grindin'
Why I'm lookin' bummy? Everybody else shinin'
Turned into a burglar and did a couple break-ins
Started as a corner boy, then turned into a kingpin
Walkin' in Magic lookin' like I were El Chapo
Hot damn Gucci, that's a cold-blooded Hublot
I can't even fuck with one hoe, I need two
And you ain't gotta call hoe, I don't need you
Jumpin' out a car with no roof in a suit hoe
What type of nigga do the shit that I do hoe?
Started as a group, but I'm so dope I went solo
Get your ass knocked off and call it free promo
Chopper make a nigga back crack like Romo
Gucci go hard on a bitch, no homo
Pull up in an 18-wheeler, me dolo
Feelin' like Sosa was born to move yayo

[Chorus: Rocko]
Life's about taking risks
I told my baby pray for me, I'm tryna be all I can be
Put my pants on just like you, so why you envy me?
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm tryna live out my dreams, if I offend you, pardon me
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm just tryna see all that I can see
Never mind me, I'm tryna be all I can be

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Ay, they wanna know, how does it feel to be a star?
How's it feel to ride around the house for your car?
How does it feel to not have to sell that raw?
I'm told 'em I'm way more paranoid 'cause now they hate me more
They say, "Rock, how does it feel to be last of a dying breed?"
You pump life into these streets, they were in dying need
Off that real shit, that softest, that uncut, that raw
That shit that they jam to everyday when they jump up
The law, the word, they meet me in the AM
My voice I bring the gate in, in the evenings, still beatin' me
Hit the club still playing, still playing when they leavin'
(How does that make you feel?)
It feels good, they believe me
They receive me, I am how they perceive me
I put my soul into these lyrics, listen, you will hear it
Backseat Mulsanne, Drop Top and the Dawn
Where would the streets be without the Trap God and the don?

[Chorus: Rocko]
Life's about taking risks
I told my baby pray for me, I'm tryna be all I can be
Put my pants on just like you, so why you envy me?
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm tryna live out my dreams, if I offend you, pardon me
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm just tryna see all that I can see
Never mind me, I'm tryna be all I can be

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Fuck your CEO and tell 'em King Gucci said that
Cause I ain't never ever hit a lick and brought the bread back
That's your CEO? We used to gamble for his contract
I damn near lost his first three albums playin' blackjack
Standin' in the trap, catchin' J's in my wavecap
Cappin' 'bout none of these niggas rappin' 'bout a fake trap
Call Ghostbusters 'cause these niggas sellin' ghost crack
Point 'em to the kitchen and the nigga need a roll [?]
Put me in the kitchen and I might just bring a whole back
Put a hole in a nigga head, tell him "hold that"
This that eggbeater music, get it out the bowl rap
This that wife beater music, sell it while it wet rap
You a dick rider and I never will respect that
Came out, took my set back, I know they didn't expect that
Gucci worth eight figures, but he tryna stretch that
My partner turned informer on me, I never woulda guessed that

[Chorus: Rocko]
Life's about taking risks
I told my baby pray for me, I'm tryna be all I can be
Put my pants on just like you, so why you envy me?
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm tryna live out my dreams, if I offend you, pardon me
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm just tryna see all that I can see
Never mind me, I'm tryna be all I can be, ay
