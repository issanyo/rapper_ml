[Intro: DJ Drama]
See my shit?
My shit like Hollywood, right?
You call this the Gangsta Grillz walk of fame
Everybody waits to get they star
Gucci has officially been inducted!
Oh, they tried to keep 'em out
But don't worry, baby!
It's mainstream America from here on out!
C'mon man
Drum Cruise, nigga, this what I do!

[Hook]
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
My shade game crazy, Cavallis and Gucci frames
And my shoe game crazy, Louis not no Nikes mane
And my ice game crazy, Gucci got them stupid chains
And my tone game crazy, I am going black tonight, black tonight

[Verse 1]
SouthSiiiide!
So Iceeey!
On Moreland Road, four Moreland hoes
I think we smoked 5 o's or mo'
After we smoked 5 o's or mo'
Them hoes left, them some Moreland hoes
Them hoes was cheap as hell
I bought 'em Goose, them hoes wanted Glen Mo'
Them hoes wanted Glen Mo' to drank
Them hoes was broke, them hoes was broke
I know them hoes from school fasho'
Them hoes' mama be smoking dope
Dem hoes mama used to sell all
They clothes to me for the low low
Starter hat and Starter coat
Starter hat and Starter coat!
Falcon shirt, the Falcon hat
The furcoat man, you know I go
Go to school so fresh, you know
With yo shit, you know I go
Go to the lunchline with a bankroll
With a big ol' bankroll
You on the bus, Chevy 4-do'
You on the bus, Chevy 4-do'
You on the bus, I'm Chevy 4-do'
Beatin down da block, Candler Road

[Hook]
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
My shade game crazy, Cavallis and Gucci frames
And my shoe game crazy, Louis not no Nikes mane
And my ice game crazy, Gucci got them stupid chains
And my tone game crazy, I am going black tonight, black tonight

[Verse 2]
A Buick Regal, 8's and Bose
On Bouldercrest, I'm selling dope
At Texaco, where Mr. Kim keep saying
"Get away from sto'!"
No I can't get 'way from sto'
I got so much blow, gotta go
Gotta go, go buy some mo'
Holla at woe, go buy some low!
On Gresham Road with Randy Low
I think we blowed a half of dro
We think we gotta buy some mo'
We so high like a brick of coke
2004 had 40 wholes
40 halves and 40 wholes
You don't know 'bout Gucci Mane
He is from 'round Gresham Road
Sun Valley soldier, flex on soldier
Standing at tha Amaco
'96, I'm in the Hamps'
Finna get a dub to blow
Antwerp with me, Duct Tape with me
Zone 6 Kirkwood fucking with me
Gucci Mane La Flare
Eastside Atlanta, that's my city, huh

[Hook]
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star
Everythang is up to par, girl look at my car
My shade game crazy, Cavallis and Gucci frames
And my shoe game crazy, Louis not no Nikes mane
And my ice game crazy, Gucci got them stupid chains
And my tone game crazy, I am going black tonight, black tonight

[Outro: DJ Drama]
You see, I used to be Samuel L. Jakson
Means I had too many snakes on my plane
But now, I'm Jack Nicholson
'Cause I'm shining on you niggas
