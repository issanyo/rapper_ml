[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci got it going on, bout to roll one a mile long
Walking through hell with gasoline draws on
Hit the bank, the guap falling off, they got me all wrong
Bullshit on top of bullshit, it's getting piled on
See I'm an OG, you better get your shot, take your child home
You'd be long gone, all gone, no one to call on
Big diamonds on my bezel, damn near bigger than rhinestone
Meanwhile 1017 on the milestone
Follow, hollow, hello, I'm painting everything red, no more yellow
I'm pulling double hurdles
Wish I never met her, Rihanna umbrella
Gucci ?, I'm like fuck a Cinderella

[Bridge 1: Gucci Mane]
Punchanella, Punchanella wearing cashmere sweater
This year I'm doing better so my pink more wetter
And she ? let her, my joint's patent leather
I want your bitch I go get her, smashed her now I can't get with her

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Punchanella, Punchanella, give me the pussy don't let up
I chase the paper don't let up, I chase the paper don't let up
Kissed the lil girl one time, then I'll never let her let up
Kissed the lil baby one fucking time, and I'll never let up
100K spent on my rings, 100K spent on my jeans
100K spent on my (wow), 100K ? clean
100K fucked the whole team, 100K spent on her
100K spent on her, 100K spread through my team
We chase paper, Charlie Sheen, I catch the ?, my wifey she slaughter them
I'm not Casino but I be killing it, killing it, killing it
The bitch say she wanna fuck on young thug because he the realiest (realest)
I been stopped attending these parties, these niggas are delirious
I done poured a four inside a eight, I'm poured
I done spent my last thousand with mojo
I'm so easy to rob, I'm always at the store
I get treated like that cause i keep big ole bowls
She got that come back, she got that hump jump, she got that Bill Clinton
She got that YSL, she got that skrr skrr, she got that owee
She got that bum lady, she say young thuggy

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Punchanella, Punchanella, give me the pussy don't let up
I chase the paper don't let up, I chase the paper don't let up
Kissed the lil girl one time, then I'll never let her let up
Kissed the lil baby one fucking time, and I'll never let up
100K spent on my rings, 100K spent on my jeans
100K spent on my (wow), 100K ? clean
100K fucked the whole team, 100K spent on her
100K spent on her, 100K spread through my team
We chase paper, Charlie Sheen (sheesh)
