[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
I'm finna get the money, stack it up
Put it away
I'm in the trap with the base
I'm in the trenches all day
I get it in on the road now
Get it in, how it goes now
Up the prices of my show now
The trap bunking, that's for sure now
Never stopping on the road now
Get the trap up, yeah
Hit the road slow, yeah
My niggas up, yeah
Walk around, double cup
Get some mud in my cup
All these hoes know what's up
I'm the motherfucking plug

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Drug money, get it swept under the rug
Bitch don't even know she's talking to the damn plug
I'm a pimp, shake her down, got stripper money
Trap boy, got legal money
On my way to a sports bar to watch the Falcons
You can bet your last dollar that Eagle coming
Teach you how to remix, schoolteacher money
Smoking all day, got reefer money
Stands for a pt., two-liter money
He the one that's broke, what he did with his money?
My dad is a drunk and my uncle's a junkie
Momma stay smiling 'cause son got the money
My watch is a fifty, my chain is a hundred
I'm scared to commit and I'm addicted to honey
I love them diamond bricks
Got a brick, but that ain't it
A hundred pints and that's not Act
Purple Kool-Aid mixed with yak
I'll point you in the right direction, bet a mil you won't come back
I gave your CEO a deal, but he was wack, I took it back
Guwop

[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]
So it was what it was
And showed them no love
Now I'm a trap nigga
All the hoods show me love
You can rain money on me if you fuck with the plug
Cinco one time her friend, now she fuck with the plug
See, we came in the slums, yeah
And they gave us no love
Now I got racks, nigga
Like I already won
You can run money up when you fuck with the plug
Cinco one time her friend, now she fuck with the plug

[Verse 3: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I'm the importer/exporter, extorter, transporter
I need every quarter like a parking meter, hang on them corners
Spread my wings, fly to Texas and California
My lawyer flipped the case, transformer
Horse carriage, I got bricks in the pony
Fuck these bitches, me and money lonely
I am the Rock, throwing elbows jabroni
Steady finessing, professor compressor
Hundred bags of pressure plugged like the Tesla
The girl too young, they think I'm a Chester
I skrt back the extras, give it to my tester
Mister T gold, my neck is a treasure
I'm with whatever, bright AKs are better
Back up a truckload, let's unload on Candler
Switzerland band, African bezel
Pablo

[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]
So it was what it was
And showed them no love
Now I'm a trap nigga
All the hoods show me love
You can rain money on me if you fuck with the plug
Cinco one time her friend, now she fuck with the plug
See, we came in the slums, yeah
And they gave us no love
Now I got racks, nigga
Like I already won
You can run money up when you fuck with the plug
Cinco one time her friend, now she fuck with the plug

[Outro: Johnny Cinco]
I'm a trap nigga
No love, yeah
They fuck with the plug, yeah
Now she fuck with the plug, yeah
In the slums
Love
I got racks now
I already won
You fuck with the plug, yeah
Now she fuck with the plug, yeah
