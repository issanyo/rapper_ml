[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
'Cus you talk so nasty (nasty)
And you dress so classy (so classy)
And you talk real jazzy (jazzy)
Couldn't let her get pass me (can't)
Had to buy the bitch a Louis
I keep her dressed in Gucci
You she know she fucking with Guwop
And she'll slap a bitch, Tooley
Drop top, she ruthless
That nigga broke he clueless (clueless)
And I don't worry about rumors
