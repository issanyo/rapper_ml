[Intro: Gucci Mane & Future]
This that 1017 and XO
If young Metro don't trust you, I'ma shoot you

[Verse 1: NAV]
You got a show, you selling tickets to your best friends
My show be sellin' out, in 20 seconds
I fucked your bitch first, gave my broski seconds
My shooter itchin', wanna shoot over a mention
Pop a pill go to a whole other dimension
Takin' perkies, I'm avoidin' my depression
Pay the lawyer, make my bro avoid a sentence
He back on road, cashing out and livin' senseless

[Pre-Chorus: NAV]
Got my pot and got my fork (got my fork, yeah)
Water whip, my wrist got torque (whip whip, yeah)
Fronted work, you can't afford (can't afford, yeah)
My clip long, don't come up short (come up short, yeah)
Call you down and you ignore (yeah)
Like Gucci Mane, we kick a door (yeah)
Buy designer when I'm bored (yeah)
Treat your main bitch like a whore (yeah)

[Chorus: NAV & Gucci Mane]
I think I need some help to count all this money (yeah)
I think I need some help to spend all these hundreds (yeah)
I'm just a brown boy that made something from nothing (yeah, me too)
Now I'm ballin' and you can't tell me nothin' (yeah)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Huh huh, this that 1017 and XO
I call NAV, he in a penthouse, smokin' next door
So much money, I ain't worry about the next show
But I paid a quarter mill' to see my neck glow
I use to sell coke, blow off my metro
They was way before I met Metro
I think lil' mama got me fucked up with the sex bro
I like her but I think I'm in love with the neck tho
Now its on to the next ho
Guwop a dog, I need a collar and a mink coat
A brainiac, she went to college with the smart folks
But I was trappin' in the 6 selling hard dope

[Bridge: NAV]
Get a check, run it up
Get a check, run it up
Get a check, run it up
Get a check, run it up
Touch me, get touched
Drinkin' Act, no Tuss
Ever since I got some money
You been actin' up

[Pre-Chorus: NAV]
Got my pot and got my fork (got my fork, yeah)
Water whip, my wrist got torque (whip whip, yeah)
Fronted work, you can't afford (can't afford, yeah)
My clip long, don't come up short (come up short, yeah)
Call you down and you ignore (yeah)
Like Gucci Mane, we kick a door (yeah)
Buy designer when I'm bored (yeah)
Treat your main bitch like a whore (yeah)

[Chorus: NAV]
I think I need some help to count all this money (yeah)
I think I need some help to spend all these hundreds (yeah)
I'm just a brown boy that made something from nothing (yeah)
Now I'm ballin' and you can't tell me nothin' (yeah)
