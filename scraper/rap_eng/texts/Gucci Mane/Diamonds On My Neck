[Verse 1: Supplya]
Diamonds in my necklace, hit me for a major chain
CCs in your wristwatch? Homeboy you be fakin' it
Real ice on, we takin' it
Now my partner wearin' it
Coolin' with your jewelry, call it stolen karat-y
I'm so iced out, put me in the freezer
Neck look like ice trays, wrist feel like freeze cups
Me and Gucci coolin' like a six pack in a cooler
If you wants a parody, go and see my jeweler

[Supplya (Nicki Minaj)]
Canary yellow stones on my chest, fruity mango
A whole lotta cash around my neck like [?]
And we takin' foreign trips, broke niggas can't though
(Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck)
Canary yellow stones on my chest, fruity mango
A whole lotta cash around my neck like [?]
And we takin' foreign trips, broke niggas can't though
(Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck)

[Verse 2∶ Gucci Mane]
Yellow fists, yellow seats, canary wrist, it hella glist
Yellow chick, she prejudiced, she only date republicans
Smokin's legal, coke hyena, keep 'em like I'm half a [?]
In a 'Rari, not a Regal, Buick to a Continental
Presidential lifestyle, you can call me Gucci Bush
Or Gucci Nixon 'cause I'm quick at smokin' kush
Purple 'vette, purple tips, purple rims, Gucci Man
Fuck the rumors, what's up block? You done heard of him

[Hook∶ Supplya (Nicki Minaj)]
Canary yellow stones on my chest, fruity mango
A whole lotta cash around my neck like [?]
And we takin' foreign trips, broke niggas can't though
(Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck)
Canary yellow stones on my chest, fruity mango
A whole lotta cash around my neck like [?]
And we takin' foreign trips, broke niggas can't though
(Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck)

[Verse 3∶ Nicki Minaj]
I just came down the rainbow, taste like mango
Money, money, money, then I switched up my lango
Just got the six, I'm too cocky to mingle
Ho ho ho! I'm looking for Kris Kringle
Get whatever boy that I lay my eye on
Keep a new toy like I'm made in Taiwan
Climbing up the jet, get to signing on them checks (Why?)
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck

[Hook∶ Supplya (Nicki Minaj)]
Canary yellow stones on my chest, fruity mango
A whole lotta cash around my neck like [?]
And we takin' foreign trips, broke niggas can't though
(Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck)
Canary yellow stones on my chest, fruity mango
A whole lotta cash around my neck like [?]
And we takin' foreign trips, broke niggas can't though
(Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck)

[Verse 4∶ Supplya]
Yellow nig, yellow wrist, yellow piss, yellow Cris
Goin' on a foreign trip, coolin' with a yellow bitch
And she got her ice on, very mellow yellow wrist
And she lost her glass slipper, she my Cinderella bitch!
What you want, baby? Ocean views?
We can do that, see the ocean, too
Got a set of earrings, ocean blue
You get half, tho, don't catch the flu
Girl you better do what I want you to
You're so fine, he want you, too
Lemon head diamonds? Got them, too
I'll cut a stone, baby, that's [?]
