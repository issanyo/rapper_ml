Every day is a hustle, i gotta keep grindin'
I'm on a phone, handlin' my business
I'm in a booth, handlin' my business
I'm on a plane, handlin' my business
I'm rockin' shows, handlin' my business


Verse 1: L.E.P

I'm waiting hooked and cooked you gotta lick that weak ahead it
You said you got a plug, if you do then whats the ticket
I'm right here on the ground, with my mind on my money
If it ain' about paper, than it truly dont concer me
Unless you try to turn me on the one of your connects
And let me get it real cheap, it's up to me to bring you back
I got it sold. Watch me stop coming for the snow
When there here im back on and I got it for the low
Seven days a week, My phone ringing off the hook
I'm selling straight meet, now how you want it? raw or cooked?
It's no time for bitches, I gotta make a move
I stay about business gengsta is what gengsta do
I'm still selling yey even knowing I'm on a tour
And I'm about getting paid all the way arrown the world
Early in the morning and I'm standing in the kitchen, yeah!
With two pots scoren I'm just handlin' my business
