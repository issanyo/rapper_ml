Soulja Boy Tellem

[Chorus]
Ey, Gucci Bandanna, Gucci, Gucci Bandanna
Ey, Gucci Bandanna, Gucci, Gucci Bandanna
Ey, Gucci Bandanna, Gucci, Gucci Bandanna
Ey, Gucci Bandanna, Gucci, Gucci Bandanna
Ey, Gucci Bandanna, Gucci, Gucci Bandanna
Ey, Gucci Bandanna, Gucci, Gucci Bandanna
Ey, Gucci Bandanna, Gucci, Gucci Bandanna
Ey, Gucci Bandanna, Gucci, Gucci Bandanna

It's Soulja Boy Tellem
I rap with Shawty Low
I got so much snow
Gucci head to toe
Chain on chill (chill)
Watch on freeze
A pound a purp got me looking like Chinese
Gucci Shades, but they still can't hide me
Hit the club, seventeen with no ID
Damn! I changed up the format
Welcome to my crib
Leave your shoes at the doormat
Uhh, and ain't this Beat tight
Chains say hello
Watch say goodnight
And I still look right
This is the good life
Gucci Bandanna just to make me look tight

[Chorus]
Gucci Bandanna
Call me Gucci Montel
Gucci girl with me
Gucci bag
Gucci sandals
She too hot to handle
Hot sex, burning candles
Gucci Mane a player
Gucci shopping this extravagant
Gucci Mane drive a drop top red phantom
And my bed got them super size Gucci spreads
Pull up to the hood
Stop and let them jock Gucci
Broads jock Gucci, cause Gucci, just Gucci
Yeah my boxer briefs
Equipped with double G's
Gucci key chain
Holding on my Gucci keys
Gucci down all the time in the summer time
I'm Gucci Mane
You would think that was my clothing line
Gucci

[Chorus]
Shawty Lo
I really want a Lanna
Scarf on my neck
Gucci Bandanna
Niggas talking slick
They filled with anmnem
But I don't care
So Got damn ya
This biggest watch
Costs more than yours
I built a house
You can't afford
It's Stupid Big
It got an ocean view, it's way up there
I look down on you
We flexed down here
That's what we do
Get in our way
I flex on you
You acting monkey
We keep bananas
Dem goons with me
Rocking bandanna

[Chorus]
