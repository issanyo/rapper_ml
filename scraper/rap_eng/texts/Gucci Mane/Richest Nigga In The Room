'89, '96, 2002
I was selling dope before they thought that shit was cool
I was the brokest damn nigga in the school
Remember they was laughing at me pointing at my shoes
Back in '92 I was a social recluse
'96 I bought me a Caprice coupe
Shot it to the first nigga sold me a deuce

[Verse 2]
2002 I was wild as hell
Trapper and a rapper I'mma sign myself
A lotta people didn’t believe time would tell
Had this dark skin girl she was fine as hell
22 years old 90 days in jail
The only thing I'm tryna do is buy a red Chevelle
This money on my head cause I robbed a well
Burned all my bridges time to sink or swim
You's a man or a mouse hammer head or brim
Bitch I'm a hard head cause I'm hard to kill
They say Gucci Mane's a cutthroat, he probably is
He'll rob, steal and kill and he probably will
They say Gucci Mane's a jackboy, he probably is
He'll rob steal and kill and he gone off them pills
Gucci

[Hook]
I was hustling before I came up out the womb

Now look at me, the richest nigga in the room
Richest nigga, richest nigga, richest nigga

I was hustling before I came up out the womb
Look at me, I'm the richest nigga in the room

I’d rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track
Man, you know I fuck with Mike Will, we go way back
