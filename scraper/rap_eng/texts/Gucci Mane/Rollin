Rollin, rollin, rollin

Rollin, rollin, rollin
We Ain't Slept in Weeks
Rollin, rollin, rollin

Rollin, rollin, rollin
We Ain't Slept in Weeks
Rollin, rollin, rollin
We Ain't Slept in Weeks
Rollin, rollin, rollin
We Ain't Slept in R-Ro-R-Ro
Rollin, rollin, rollin
We Ain't Slept in Weeks

[Verse 1 Jackie Chan]
Poppin bottles, keep em pouring
How we rolling, V.I.P
Its Jackie Chan, who da man?
Everybody know its me
I keep myself surrounded by some dime pieces every night
Tall and short, th-thick and skinny, black and white every type
K-Keep em coming, ain't no secret
If she with it, she can get it
But just wait, gi-give me a minute
Ca-Cause right now the room is spinnin
Pourin Juice to kick it in
Rollin Blunts, and kickin it
Music bumpin, ain't it somethin
How they get the smiffin beer
Feel the bass, its beatin hard
Against her body, make her horny
Guess she heard I keep them skittles
Thats why she be up all on me
5 blunts of purp, and I still ain't high (Bo-Low)
Ten Pack of pills, half way gone, I'm about to (Throw-Up)
Throwin up, its all good
That just kick my buzz in
On the couch, lovin'
The way these girls back-rubbin
Blowing on them sweets, and your boy about to peak
I've been rollin, rollin, rollin I ain't slept in weeks

[Hook]

[Verse 2 Kid Cudi]
Wordd....I can't feel the left side of my face
Stressful thoughts have been replaced
With Henny and coke and Jaeger man
Jackie told me pump my breaks
I told him pass me somethin to bop (or pop)
Told me not to smoke my weed
I-I should listen, I can't stop
Grabbin models by the arm
I tell em to fuck with Moon Man
They dont even trip on my aggression
They just slowly take my hand
Then they open up and say
Do you want to play with me
I-I-I say Baby I'm all about it
My hotel is down the street
This is kind of how it is
When you living young and fast
Management is playing loud
Bitches dancin, shakin ass
Zulu tryin' pass the blunt
I told em that Im'ma have to pass
Cause if I decide to smoke it
I-I will float to leaner land
With my man, is that so bad
Different from reality
I try and tell my nigga man Melwesky
Hope my mom ain't mad at me
My lifestyle is a wild life with style
And my brain on drugs
I won't stop until I'm numb
Tellin myself the night is young

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Whole club going off
Hittin' the middle showing off
Blue wevizit pumas got me rolling like a bowling ball
I just wanna sneak away
Take you to another place
We could have some fun if you just come with me lets run away
We can leave this shit behind
Ain't got nothing else but time
Pop a superman and watch how quick you stimulate your mind
Take you to that other level way beyond that cloud 9
Go back to my crib and just relax and have some down time
Make you ball all night long
Try to put it through your back
Say you coming down well momma eat one of these triple stack
Rolling leads to freaki -ness
Lets go have some freaky sex
Bring some of your friends and we can turn this to a freaky fest
I just wanna run away
Take you were you wanna be
You ain't gotta worry about a thang if you just come with me
Blowing on them sweets
And your boy about to peak
Ive been rolling rolling rolling and I ain't slept in weeks
