[Hook: Shawty Lo] x2
I still got 'em for the LO
I still got 'em for the LO
17.5, all you gotta do is hollow
I still got 'em for the LO

[Shawty Lo]
100 units man, I sent the bitches back (back)
I'm prejudiced, fuck with nothing but some white girls
I know you like girls, yeah I got girls
And they all young, 18 and under
Cold winters, hot summers
I can't complain, the base did numbers
10 summers, no fumbles
Birth niggas, like mama
Do it big, one life to live
You see my charm, it's bigger than his
20 thou, a dime, each year
3 felonies, all I get is a year

[Gucci Mane]
Call my nigga Shawty Lo
He connected to the socket where the middleman at
And I'm making all the profit
Sixes on the skirts, man I'm already mounted it
Million dollars worth of notes, I already did done counted it
Fifty slab shawty, turned to Gucci bag shawty
On the Ave, 40 cal, still signing autographs
Purple 'thrax, party packs, even got them powder sacks
70 on my Jacob and the whole hood proud of that
Young Doug E. fresh, I can sign my damn self
Got 8 orders to cook like a wafflehouse chef
"Gucci Mane you rich, why you sell that boy that brick?"
That wasn't even it, it didn't come back shit
You got my number partner and you calling like a bitch
Here's a message to your partner: tell that boy to suck my dick
18.5, Gucci, Louis on my bitch
I got blazing saddle bitches that suck powder off my dick
A million dollars give it up, no cowards in my click
Yeah and Gucci print is on my bricks nigga

[Stuntman]
Stuntman bricks, 17.5, you know I got 'em
Buy 4 or more on my spot you can drop em
I ain't flexin, I'm a kingpin
New 500 Benz, the rims spin
D4L, that's the crew
I represent that shit, when I rock my jewels
I'm icey, so pricey
100 bricks in that car without no license
I'm a thug nigga, slash drug dealer
Fuck with ya boy, you know I keep a plug nigga

I still got 'em for the LO
I still got 'em for the LO
