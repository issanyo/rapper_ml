[Intro]
I'm a Multi-Millionaire
Multi-Millionaire La Flare nigga
It’s Gucci, it's Wizop
BRR BRR, catch up (go, go, go)

[Verse 1]
I'm smiling like the Joker
All these choker chains keep chokin' me
Trying to keep the poker face, my extended clip keep pokin' me
All these tinted chains and bracelets look like diamonds crawlin' on me
Haters keep provoking me, bitches keep on callin' on me
Fuck the beef bring me the cheese, ain't no rapper hot as me
Fuck yo plug come shop with me, can't nobody fuck with me
All the lean I serve is clean, bought a new rerock machine
This shit come from Medellín you can step on it again
Naked hoes in front of me, nasty as I wanna be
That boy just a wannabe, Gucci it's just one of me
My shoes never fit your feet, you ain't cut from the same cloth as me
Bring my Rolexes to me, and take these handcuffs off of me

[Hook]
All my friends are millionaires, I hang out with millionaires
Million here, million there, Multi-Millionaire La Flare
My Lil' chick a millionaire, my homeboys are millionaires
Million here, million there, Multi-Millionaire La Flare
I done pushed a million bales, I done served a million squares
Million here, million there, Multi-Millionaire La Flare
Colder than a Frigidaire, done kicked it with a million players
Million here, million there, Multi-Millionaire La Flare

[Verse 2]
Call me Gucci got them gasbags, fuck a nigga hashtag
Mister mister Trap God, cash in the trash bag
Rolled a pound bag, two stacks, call me Daddy Fat Sax
Bombs over Baghdad rappers in a knapsack
Tryna lock the whole trap, damn I miss my old trap
Damn I miss my old trap, damn I miss my old trap
(Bouldercrest Road, man, East Atlanta, Zone 6)
Wrist so rocky got ya bitch jockey, asap
Every nigga tote a yoppa nigga we-a K Camp
Undisputed heavyweight champion I'm a state champ
I'mma make her panties get damp, they gon' stay damp
Riding with the lady and the tramp, met my plug off the ramp
Got them thangs with the stamp, he a millionaire

[Hook]
All my friends are millionaires, I hang out with millionaires
Million here, million there, Multi-Millionaire La Flare
My Lil' chick a millionaire, my homeboys are millionaires
Million here, million there, Multi-Millionaire La Flare
I done pushed a million bales, I done served a million squares
Million here, million there, Multi-Millionaire La Flare
Colder than a Frigidaire, done kicked it with a million players
Million here, million there, Multi-Millionaire La Flare
