[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
First thing’s first man let’s get some understood
I’m a street nigga straight up out the hood
I remember the first day I met the plug
When I came back to the city bussin jugs
Tell the jack boys I wish a nigga would
On the real my nigga we been gambling good
.44 full, dog, up in the club
I’m obsessed with sipping lean and smoking bud
My mama say the neighbors think I’m selling drugs
I told my mama chill and then gave her a dub
I turnt the stove on then gave mama a hug
Now when these niggas re-up, they re-up with us

[Chorus]
Jug, you’re just another damn jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug
Jug, and I jug so good
Bitch don’t even know it, she can leave the damn hood
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Man a nigga set tripping in the wrong damn hood
Call a nigga cuz when he shoulda said blood
Hood nigga know that he gotta show love
Pull up to the club spend a whole damn dub
Hey, it’s your god damn move
You arguing about a bitch and she’s a god damn slut
What? And now you car shot up
Beefing bout a bitch with a glued on butt
Hey, you tryna act all tough
Got them hundos in my pockets
Stamped in god we trust
Stupid waves no brush, she screaming
How he cookin' dope and he ain't using no fork

[Chorus]
Jug, you’re just another damn jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug
Jug, jug and I jug so good
Bitch don’t even know it, she can leave the damn hood
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
1991 when I first start jugging
Wouldn’t make a profit till I first start cooking
I’m standing on the crest like the boulder crest bully
Call your plug and tell that nigga that that Gucci Mane took it
If you lock me up I’m gonna get out and start back juuging
Sun valley apartments and the Neighbors keep looking
Gave a nick to my uncle and I told him how was it
Glass house, straight drop, yeah he loved it
Got a stash house, a scrap house, my trap house bunkin
Flashback, I damn near had to bust my cousin
Playing fucking games with the Gucci man money
Jugs, jugs, jugs, jugs, jugs hope these jugs keep coming

[Chorus]
Jug, you’re just another damn jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug
Jug, jug and I jug so good
Bitch don’t even know it, she can leave the damn hood
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug
