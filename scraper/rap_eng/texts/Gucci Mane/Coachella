[Refrain]
Cold weather, just performed at Coachella
It's a cold summer so I'ma paint the Lamb yellow (yewww)

[Verse 1]
Watch wetter, Patek and it's an eye catcher
That's your wife,  get her, so cold I need like five sweaters (brrr)
She getting with you, don't spend your lifetime snitching
I'm a ill nigga, come get a life size picture
I'm a wild pitcher, watch out cause bitch, I might hit ya
Brought your bitch witcha, watch me cause I might Mike Vick her

[Chorus]
My summer cold
This for my niggas on the stove getting out the bowl
I'm an Eskimo I live with snow, hoe snorting coke
This for my niggas in a hole, still selling dope
(burr, burr, burr)
My summer cold
This for my niggas on the stove getting out the bowl
I'm an Eskimo I live with snow, hoe snorting coke
This for my niggas in a hole, still selling dope
(burr, burr, burr)

[Verse 2]
Soft-top Rolls, I pulled out the parking lot
This bitch won't pick up the phone she must think I'm Travis Scott (hoe)
Gucci so dope like they pulled him out the pot
Don't care if your man play ball or not bitch all tote is bankrolls
When you super cold then they drop it likes it's hot
These hoes ain't really fucking you they fucking what you got bro
Yeah that ass on swole but you know that bitch a thot
Told her suck it like she love it and you better not waste a drop
(hot)

[Chorus]
My summer cold
This for my niggas on the stove getting out the bowl
I'm an Eskimo I live with snow, hoe snorting coke
This for my niggas in a hole, still selling dope
(burr, burr, burr)
