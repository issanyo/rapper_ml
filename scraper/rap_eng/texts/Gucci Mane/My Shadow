Fifty thousand dollars all in the air and shit
Brick Squad, dope boi, and the money man
GUCCI!

[Verse 1]
I'm a so Icey veteran so you can't say beginners luck
All my boys tote choppaz so your best bet robbin' armored trucks
Georgia boys don't give a fuck, we'll jack you then we'll tie you up
50-50 chance that we'll trick you if you shop with us
Boulder crest so dirty dirty, zone six boys tote thirty thirties
Glock 9 under Falcon jerseys make you need some plastic surgery
Bandana under my eye, hat so low can't see my face
And if you got them cake to bake then Gucc might do a home invasion
Hi my name is Gucci Gucci meet my homeboy Mackie Slug
Sawed-off AR pulled out shorty you know I got extra slugs
Black T still on when I mob, black lugz still on when I walk
Black pistol 23 my nigga he'll think thats my second job

[Hook]
I walk around the city like, it don't matter
The earth my turf nobody tries me cause they know better
So save the chit chatta I'm too deep you boys shallow
I run 4 deep me and myself and I and plus my shadow
Shadow, my shadow, hold me down for whateva
Even if I tried my best I couldn't run from my shadow
So no matter, how wealthy that I get he's not jealous
So when I have no one to talk to, I talk to my shadow!

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm thorough, under my polo, I'm out on promo
Got these tear drops, under my izzeye, don't make it one more
And I had kilos, one for like 2-0, that was 0-4
I had drizzo, you bad da smizzo, but keep it low though
Don't tell the po-po, I'm friend with fizzo, cause thats a no-no
Smokin' guido, me and my vatos, but you's a bozo
I'm passin' low yo, down to La Plizzo, this shit like Wayco
I got candy paint on my '74, your shit from Maaco
And off the tizzop, connect the dizzots, I'm building legos
Ran the tizan just like them waffles, I call them eggos
I got hundreds, all in my pocket, a stupid bank roll
If ya try me, coroner gon' wrap you, up like an egg roll

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bricks, all white bricks
Corner-boy I probably sold more rocks than a rock pit
Tryin' to fill my shoes is like an armless man with chops sticks
Got a dark brown soft top bentley chocolate
I'm so mach 6, homeboy you so not shit
Playin' free can't come touch me cause you're not it
I'm on fire steaming hot, I can boil grits
Jet-Li with the shoes, Gucci rockin' new kicks
ATLiens baby girl let's have a moon day
Got 8 bedrooms I'm dying for a roommate
I was home schooled, I didn't have a schoolmate
Psych! I went to trap school 60K in 12th grade
I'm a millionaire but self-made wealth craze
Like a junkie cravin' bricks so I'm in kitchens all day
I'm a millionaire but self-made wealth craze
Like a junkie cravin' bricks so I'm in kitchens all day
SKRRRR!
