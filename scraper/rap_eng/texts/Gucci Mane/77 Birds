77 birds in a trash can
My cooker cook the dope with his left hand
Six hundred bales in the caravan
Do the math thats a whole lot of free bands

[Young Scooter]
I know I say some shit you wouldn't understand
Just to walk in my shoes you need a million cash
Plus you need another hundred thousand just for gas
All that road running, trapping for them free bands
Salute my partner pimp, thats my right hand
Look at all the shit we did you'd get a hundred years
My plug said i made 'em like 200 mills
Introduced him to that jug and gave me stupid deals
How you selling kilos and going back broke
Can’t worry about a bitch when you got kilos
You a real nigga don’t disrespect the dough
I got bricks in every trash can in mexico

[Gucci Mane]
We bought a split so I couldn't afford a free skeet
They say I'm winning like a nigga got a cheat sheet
Damn, got a girl with them squares .. I call her KiKi
And have them hundreds face up when you meet me
When i hit it make it come back hard as concrete
You p**sy nigga cross the street i cross the country
And if you suck a glass dick you's a junkey
I got a fetish yeah i love counting money ..
77 birds in the trash can
Sold so many singles I should be on SoundScan
Sold so many deuces I should be on a wanted poster
And I whip so much dope my arm need a motor

[Younger Scooter]
I done been the driver of the caravan
Inside the van I got like 600 bands
I-95 with them Georgia tags
I’m head it to New York, Brooklyn
Pull up in your hood i’m a road runner
Told you niggas young scooter takin orders
Plus I love for all my dope to hold the water
Every day the sunshine, we cross the border
I’m in mexico fucking with the Migos
Me and cartel counting up zeros
I got more clientele than my plug though
Soldier walking with them bands, that's 44
