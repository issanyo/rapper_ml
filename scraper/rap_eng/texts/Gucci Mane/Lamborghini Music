[Intro: Ralo]
Lamborghini, Lamborghini music
Lamborghini, Lamborghini music
Lamborghini, Lamborghini music
Lamborghini, Lamborghini music (Famgoon!)
Lamborghini, Lamborghini music

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ralo]
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (hoppin' out the Lambo)
Hoppin' out the Lambo (and hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (and hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lamb, them haters know who I am
I know them people don't like me, I really don't give a damn
I still take care of the fam, and tell my mama yes ma'am
My niggas know that I'm solid, and I will never betray 'em

[Verse 1: Ralo]
I bought your favorite car, ain't this what you saving for?
I'm Mr. Dog Food, who the fuck you take me for?
Come make a movie 'bout me, my niggas don't move without me
I told my dog I'm on my way, you better not shoot without me
We want all the smoke, we want all the smoke
You think the opps ain't bout that shit, you must be smokin' dope
You better not book me with them folks, we might shoot up the show
You better not look in my Lambo, I might be with your ho

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ralo]
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (hoppin' out the Lambo)
Hoppin' out the Lambo (and hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (and hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lamb, them haters know who I am
I know them people don't like me, I really don't give a damn
I still take care of the fam, and tell my mama yes ma'am
My niggas know that I'm solid, and I will never betray 'em

[Verse 2: Ralo]
Lamborghini, Lamborghini, you so much to me
I never let a bitch get in if that bitch ugly
You ain't gotta fall in love with me, bitch you love the car
We ain't gotta fuck inside a room, we fuckin' in the car
I swear that pussy get real wet, every day I gotta feel that
I'ma pay that girl monthly rent, please tell me where the bills at
You can be Keyshia, I will be Gucci
I won't be stupid, long as we stupid
Long as we stupid for each other
Hop in the Lamb and burn rubber

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ralo]
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (hoppin' out the Lambo)
Hoppin' out the Lambo (and hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (and hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lamb, them haters know who I am
I know them people don't like me, I really don't give a damn
I still take care of the fam, and tell my mama yes ma'am
My niggas know that I'm solid, and I will never betray 'em

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I just pulled up on a barbie, candy red Ferrari
Non-apologetic, I'm not really really sorry
My neck look like a Fiji (brr), face look like graffiti
All on these people TV, I know you see me (it's Gucci)
Jumpin' out the genie, my wrist look like it's freezin'
My ears look like they blinkin', it looks so easy
Park right in front of Neimans, still can't believe it
This brand new Lamborghini, she showin' cleavage

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ralo]
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (hoppin' out the Lambo)
Hoppin' out the Lambo (and hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lambo (and hoppin' out the Lambo)
I feel like hoppin' out the Lamb, them haters know who I am
I know them people don't like me, I really don't give a damn
I still take care of the fam, and tell my mama yes ma'am
My niggas know that I'm solid, and I will never betray 'em
