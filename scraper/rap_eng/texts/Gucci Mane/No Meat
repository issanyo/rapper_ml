[Intro: Gucci Mane]
When I had no money I still had sauce, so if you don't got no sauce, then you're lost
But you can also get lost in the sauce
A bitch, a bitch gon' get lost in the sauce mane (Right, right, right)
Know what I mean? (I dig it)
Overdosed in sauce
No- No meat jus' sauce

(That's very impressive finessing)

[Verse: Lil Snip]
Always got a bitch on call
She love me 'cause I really do ball (ya)
She love me 'cause I spend a hunnid racks at the mall (ouu)
Show up at your house like the feds
Bitch where my meds?
I'm finessin' all the Percs and the Xans
And we bustin' at your mans (what?)
And your bitch basic, wearin' Vans
My hoe foreign, she from PT
And really rip the BT
Bitch we FCE, come fuck on me (fuck on me!)
Got the Supersoaker, for you baby (baby)
Come fuck wit' FCE
OT, that's me (that's me!)
Rollin' through Rideau, with the 30 bitch
The 30 bitch
Yeah, we hood rich

[Chorous: LU$O & Lil Snip]
Yeah we got the sauce
No meat, just sauce
In the streets you'll be lost
No meat, just sauce
I got my money up, so now I got the sauce
No meat, just sauce
No meat, just (sauce)

Yeah we got the sauce
No meat, just sauce
In the streets you'll be lost
No meat, just sauce
I got my money up, so now I got the sauce
No meat, just sauce
No meat, just (sauce, ya)

[Verse: LU$O]
Ok, it's LU$O in the bitch and yo' bitch stay on my dick
On the wrist got the drip
On the hip keep the clip
Ok, dimes hit my line all the time, dawg
Then they grind and provide for the guy, dawg
Mixed the wine with the lines, I ain't lyin', dawg
She got high as the sky, now she lyin' down
Now she lyin' down
Yo' bitch mine now
Yo' bitch mine now
Yo' bitch mine now
Yo' bitch fine, ya
Yo' bitch mine now
Ya, she mine
Ya, she aye, ya (suck it)

[Chorous: LU$O & Lil Snip]

In the streets you'll be lost
No meat, just sauce
I got my money up, so now I got the sauce
No meat, just sauce
No meat, just (sauce)

Yeah we got the sauce
No meat, just sauce
In the streets you'll be lost
No meat, just sauce
I got my money up, so now I got the sauce
No meat, just sauce
No meat, just (sauce, ya)
