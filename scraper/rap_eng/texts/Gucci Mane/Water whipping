(Verse 1, gucci mane)

Yeah im so fucking dumb i got diamonds thumb
I got a diamond on my dick so thats a diamond on her tongue
And i can't feed you baby cuz im romanticly numb
Emotion is dumb i just came her so i could cum
Theres nothing on the list sun that i haven't done
I got a lot of problems get pussy just isnt 1
Girls are like wrestlers every 15 man they won
Now their like potato chips i just cannot have 1
And i just might like you for a minute
But i dont like youre friends in my buisness
And i feel like you deserve a dissin
Cuz you in the kitchen with me water whippin


(Verse 2, blake)
Uhuuuuuuuh i know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you probably say that shit to everybody so we hear you talkin boo but we just dont believe you
Okey im all about it all for it all star team jordan small forward
Never puttin up a shot unless it calls for it no hazetation so im shooting if i draw for it pow pow
Fuck is up now man im in this ho live is moving fast where the fuck do all this minutes go
Mixtape droppin i start gettin in this show
Now im gettin hundreds what the fuck you think im in it for
Young money forever ive been good at stacking spree
Fuck u to the haters that spend their time attacking me
Shoutout to youre girlfriend nigga lately she been striking me
Wondering if im the best well i ain't no blaceyedpeace
Girls wanna fuck and guys they wanna be you
Roundin up around a block so they can get to see you
I feel like i find a wife exactly when in need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just dont believe you
Uhuuuuuh i know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you probably say that shit to everybody so we hear you talkin boo but we just dont believe you
