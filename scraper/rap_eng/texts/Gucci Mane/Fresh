[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's so hard to take the trap out a trap nigga
I'm a coke dealer dressed like a rap figure
A Guy Fisher type of nigga, I'mma die richer
Posing for pictures with the strippers and the pot flippers
I'd rather lie to ya baby then I lie with ya
I seen you with his shit, I ain't finna ride with ya
Pitching underhand I'm a knuckle ball pitcher
You off base I call you out, I'm the hind catcher
You ran off, guess you thought it'd be a cakewalk
Stealing base, got caught, let the K talk
Got me digging in my safe at the safe house
Like I won't pay a 100k to blow ya face off

[Hook: Gucci Mane & Lil Uzi Vert]

Yeah in the strip club with my nigga big Guwop, and Wop we just changed the weather
Somebody grab my sweater, cause I just changed the weather
Yeah we make it rain together, we make it rain together
