[Intro: Gucci Mane]
I got a question. What's up with all these fuck niggas dick ridin', pocket watchin', yes man ass nigga. Get you some paper, mind your motherfuckin' business. Pussy ass nigga, ho type ass nigga, hah

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Run up on the kid, worst thing you coulda did
I'm like David Copperfield, I do magic with the cig
A pig in wolf clothing still ain't nothin' but a pig
187 on him, throw him off the bridge
I feel like Milly Mill cause I'm so close to the edge
I feel like these crackers tryna push me off the ledge
Sip so much lean that I'm woozy in the head
Got me snorin' so loud Keisha push me out the bed
Gucci Mane party, Ace of Spades, pour out a keg
Gold Audemar look like I just cracked an egg
And I can't keep in touch with the niggas I grew up with
Cause I know them niggas prolly keepin' in touch with the feds

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Pocket watchin' nigga, you'se a pocket watchin' nigga
Pocket watchin' bitches, you'se a pocket watchin' bitch
Pocket, pocket watchin', why you watchin' a nigga pocket?
Pocket watchin' niggas tryna count a nigga profit
Pocket watchin' nigga, you'se a pocket watchin' nigga
Pocket watchin' bitches, you'se a pocket watchin' bitch
I know that these bitches man these bitches pocket watchin'
Tryna count my bread, tryna count a nigga profit

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Bitch eat that dick up get sloppy toppy
Got two dirty diamondbacks in my back pocket
(Molly rocks, I got em in the fifth pocket)
Two gold chains on me, I'm King Jaffe
We straight droppin’ the dope, we let you rerock
I see pussy pocket watchers through the Diors
I kept a snub nose on me
Ever since I jumped off the porch
Stackin' the profit and juugin' with the .448
The Rollie Day Date , whip up brick, turn it to a Patek Philippe
The bitch, gotta wet up the sheets, the piece, the weed
Fuck up every kitchen with Alicia Keys
Hand picked the VVS’s with the cocoa leaves
Pocket watchin' turn em into Sammy SosaWee
Pocket watchin' make these hoes wanna panhandle
Flip her with the loccs blue bandana
Still pourin' up your profit in the Fanta nigga
I see ‘em pocket watchin’ (?) nigga
Got the heckler singin' a capella nigga
For the profit I put ‘em back together
(WhileThe Wop) was just locked up in federal
I took the bail made popcorn kettle
Took to the band and bought the whole top shelf, cookies
Stuff crust it nigga I ain't no (?)
Still geeked up that why I can't go round Gucci

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Pocket watchin' nigga, you'se a pocket watchin' nigga
Pocket watchin' bitches, you'se a pocket watchin' bitch
Pocket, pocket watchin', why you watchin' a nigga pocket?
Pocket watchin' niggas tryna count a nigga profit
Pocket watchin' nigga, you'se a pocket watchin' nigga
Pocket watchin' bitches, you'se a pocket watchin' bitch
I know that these bitches man these bitches pocket watchin'
Tryna count my bread, tryna count a nigga profit
