[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Banger
You know I got that banger on me
You know I'm a gangster homie
You steal from us we cut off niggas fingers
I gots to keep this banger with me
This drum hold a hundred fifty
Hoppin' out big bands and pistols, hanging

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Red diamonds,  blue diamonds, white diamonds
My crew shinin'
Dope money, gold diggers, I don't like her but she so fine
Beat the lining up out the pussy
That nigga might just try to eat the liner
Stand behind me cause I'm the finest
Gucci Mane niggas say your highness
Ball out like George Gervin
I'm a real killer but a good person
Ain't no turf it ain't your turf
Got a watch look just like a starburst
Everybody start running
It's a outburst at my concert
And my converse and my converter can't converse with no fuck's worth

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Gangbanger banger and dro slanger
I got cash up out the anus
You want beef go buy a angus
Pistol speak another language
This nigga the lamest lamest
Goofiest, remained a stain
Glock on me I bang it bang it
In my trunk it's wangin' wangin'
Stankin stankin
Don't want your crew it's stanky stanky
Take a hundred jab all white then I sling it sling it
My D line I named it Brandon
I'm a gangbanger not a witness ain't got no statements
One in the head, it's off safety
So let a nigga try to play me
GTA me, Saint's Row his ass pistols get to spraying, banging

[Hook] x3
