[Verse 1: Bricc Baby]
Lamborghini sittin' on my wrist
You fuck around, I fuck your bitch
Rollie on my arm don't tick
I only got time to get rich (touchdown)
Bitch I got the traphouse bunkin'
Get the pack on like rock
Lowkey chillin' on the block all day
I hammer young nigga, make it boom (touchdown)
Gettin' to the racks all day
Mission impossible, makin' more cake
I ain't even trippin', I do what I say
When they touch down I just turn up to say (touchdown)
Yeah you gon' get it on time
Drum everywhere, throw bullets on nine
I'm feelin' like Tetris, I'm pushin' the block
Whippin' the ride, then trap out the spot (touchdown)

[Refrain]
Goddamnit I scored!
Give me some more
I'ma make it roll oh
We winnin', we kick in your door
You're lookin' at gold
Score a couple times, hit her up
You know I'm shippin' bags if you want it
You see the Rollie, you see the light

[Hook: Bricc Baby]
Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Trap turn down for what?
Put up 3.5 and a blunt
A half a pint in my cup
I put my dick in your cut
I got my truck in the front
But I'll meet him in the dark
And I was so fucked up they called the ambulance
Smoke so many blunts they called the fire truck
Pimp C in my cup, nigga I'm raisin' the dead
Rottweiler, feed it gunpowder cause I got Ks by the bed
They call me GuWop El Chapo, fuck nigga, off with your head
When you playin' with ten, nigga, you fuckin' with dreads
When you fuckin' with dread, nigga, it's off with your head
Spray the crime scene red, for some shit that you said
Why you turned down, nigga? What you ran out of bread?
It's Wop!

[Hook: Bricc Baby]
Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit!
Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown

[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
Shitro, met, ride, Longway, Julio
Touchdown with the 448, we kickin', feet are gone
Sherbet, cherry pie, gas, rollin' up gelato
Blue Benjamins in the duffle, Longway might hit the lotto
Burberry boutique on my wrist, I can't wear Movado
I sell my Michael Vick, I got dog food in Chicago
Bricc Baby gold, 202 grams, they hollow
Smith & Wesson kill TEC, fill 'em up with hollows
Longway Deniro, in every state he havin' euros
Thousand in grams, fresh out the safe, servin' brillo
Scrape the dope out the side of the pot then go trap with the minnows
Choppas'll drape you, they call me Longway Al Pacino

[Verse 4: Bricc Baby]
Save me a perc on the bricks
Fuck around, you get finessed
Young niggas out hittin' licks
Nigga I ain't give him my check (touchdown)
You ain't gettin' right here
Niggas stop to change then it's gone like ooh
That's not an option
My niggas live like it's nothin' to lose
UPS shippin' all day
When it touchdown, just give 'em one K
I'm hopin' that nigga don't think I won't play
I kick in his door and I'm wavin' that K (touchdown)

[Refrain]
Goddamnit I scored!
Give me some more
I'ma make it roll oh
We winnin', we kick in your door
You're lookin' at gold
Score a couple times, hit her up
You know I'm shippin' bags if you want it
You see the Rollie, you see the light

[Hook: Bricc Baby]
Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown
