[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Rock star lifestyle, might don't make it
Living life high, everyday clique wasted
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stinky
Wake up in the morning, 10 o'clock drinking
"Party, party, party!" Let's all get wasted
Shake it for me, baby girl, do it buttnaked
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted
Tell the bartender send me twenty more cases

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Geeking like Whitney, geeking like Britney
Gucci no hippie, but he stoned like Jimmy
X-pill poppers, geeked up crazy
Whole clique rolling, everyone's wasted
Purple Codeine, Sprite pink, don't waste it
Mix-up, grandma drink it, didn't taste it
Now grandma sipping syrup, leaning wasted
Walking around, fucked up twisting her fingers
Homegirl slipped up, drunk, got wasted
Now she backstage and she trying to get famous
See me out there drinking, drinking, Gucci Mane shake it
Club life, damn right, Gucci Mane wasted

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Rock star lifestyle, might don't make it
Living life high, everyday clique wasted
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stinky
Wake up in the morning, 10 o'clock drinking
"Party, party, party!" Let's all get wasted
Shake it for me, baby girl, do it buttnaked
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted
Tell the bartender send me twenty more cases

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Waka Flocka in the club, I bet the line long
I'm wasted, man, my mind gone
Fucked up, man, I'm in another time zone
Looking for a bad bitch so I could grind on
Record deal signing bonus, wasted
Poured twelve bottles of the Henny, just don't waste it
I don't drink white liquor, I'm a racist
Strictly brown 'cause I love the way the taste is
No chases, tell the waitress
To keep them bottles coming 'cause I'm getting money
Pockets on full, big face hundreds
One single, "O Let's Do It", got a nigga stunting

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Rock star lifestyle, might don't make it
Living life high, everyday clique wasted
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stinky
Wake up in the morning, 10 o'clock drinking
"Party, party, party!" Let's all get wasted
Shake it for me, baby girl, do it buttnaked
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted
Tell the bartender send me twenty more cases

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Whole click faded, we geeked up crazy
Big boy bracelets, we white boy wasted
No shirts, fuck it, our necks and arms are tatted
We sloppy drunk, disgusted, the liquor keep wasting
285 Eastside, me and (Flocka!) wasted
Racing, Chevy beating, booty/butt chasing
Spring Break, 50 thousand white girls shaking
Some dancing naked, but everyone's wasted
Magic City Monday, ballplayer wasted
This is for your uncle drinking Thunderbird, wasted
12-pack wasted, I need more cases
And Gucci's not a racist, all my diamonds Caucasians
