Man it's Guwop in this bitch, dropping cash on it, cash on it
Watch so sick, my chain so sick that all my skin got rashes on it
I fuck so many bitches everyday that all my cars got scratches on ‘em
Bougie bitch, she’s super ratchet, keep that gat like inspector gadget
Hood nigga, I’m super classy, she can’t pass no beauty pageant
But she got stupid ass, me and my gas a gangster package
Headed to the package store, I had to drop off that extra baggage
4-5 on me, 50 racks, so yeah my pants got extra saggage

Guwop in this bitch, pour a doo-wop in this bitch
And I’m bringing trap rap back in hip-hop in this bitch
I said bitch stop when my 'rarri stop, I had to go get some blunts
Call me Gucci Mane, Gucci 2 Times
But I only can fuck you once, bitch

All my niggas got money on ‘em
Couple these niggas got warrants on ‘em
All these niggas got pistols on ‘em
Your ho got your eyes on ‘em
All these niggas got pending charges
All these niggas got suspended licenses
All my niggas got stupid goons
And all my niggas be super icy

Super, super duper icy
Walking, wanna ?
Yo ho keep on looking at me
Caught you emotional, looking frightened
I just bought 200 pounds
I’mma need me some Philly tigers
I think I should copyright it
‘Cause half of these niggas out here be biting
Gucci Mane cool and the boy go fool
But I swear to God, man, I don’t like it
When I see the nigga I’mma shoot him up
Better bring your gun and leave your Nikes
Take my advice might save your life
Nigga, make my day, don’t see your night
Nigga, pray every day before you leave your house
Get killed in your boots ‘cause you life ain't right
Gucci Mane I'm a real dirty nigga
All my niggas talk dirty pistols, ? in 30 minutes
Seeing them smoke 200 swishers
Came to the club like 50 niggas, but we snuck in 200 pistols
Life full of product, got a pocket full of molly
And that goddamn bitch gonna ?

Guwop in this bitch, pour a doo-wop in this bitch
And I’m bringing trap rap back in hip hop in this bitch
I said bitch stop when my 'rarri stop, I had to go get some blunts
Call me Gucci Mane, Gucci 2 Times
But I only can fuck you once, bitch

All my niggas got money on ‘em
Couple these niggas got warrants on ‘em
All these niggas got pistols on ‘em
Your ho got her eyes on ‘em
All these niggas got pending charges
All these niggas got suspended licenses
All my niggas got stupid goons
And all my niggas be super icy

Call me Gucci Mane, Gucci two times
But I only can fuck you once, bitch
