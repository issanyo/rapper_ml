[Hook]
Man my hood like a jungle, every day is a rumble
Man my hood like a zoo, men it scared to come true
We got lions and tigers, got gorillas and bears
We get money of lean and we move to white squares

[Verse 1 - Chubbie Baby]
I got some bunnies that's blood, baby scream is a wolf
They be tricked down in red, every time it come true
I got some parties that script, yeah they stay in that blue
They'll be raping the seas, every time it come true
I got some credit card niggas, run enough in them bands
Yeah yeah they all bout them banges, stack enough to be franks
All All you need is a name ? and social
And what your bank account clean
Look here's the fuck if they know me
Met my hood like a zoo, I swear to God let me show you
Little niggas fell teen, running round with the Hammer
If their ? is awesome, ride your ass for that work
Don't worry bout them niggas, watch the bitch in the skirt
Man that pussy you get em, man that pussy you hit em
He a sucker for love, yeah them pussy them dinner
If I pump your car, and you step bout that bitch
Man the Hammer is on you, man taking your shit
That's the New York hustle, you a New York trouble
Got some New York goons, that's a New York muscle
And the high was worst, mean the corner you're living
If you're playing that role, like you're holding them chickens

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Is been my hood like a zoo, you know my hood is a zoo
These niggas grown like a circus, I swear they work for the zoo
I put you wish on the doctor boy, let it splash here the pool
I live wish water the party, you know we crash it the rule
Who put you bad the ? black card the ? rule
I want a bed full of goons, they got a shit low the tools
I don't know millions dollars gangsta, but his partner's a shoot
I need a parachute, every time I stand over Louie
I'm sipping juice for the dues, I'm in the coop what a rule
He got the blunt with the fruit, there's like a trial with no dough
I got the scrub with the holster, I put this night to your throat
Your legend is got a promotion, but I just ball me a boat

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Young Scooter]
My hood is New York, Brooklyn the zoo, the Mexico city my hood is too
We got bird they fly, We got fishes no high
My trap do numbers I got jades in life
In my hood is snake, them snitches in every hood
A lot of rappers they fake, they can't go back to their hood
Cause their hood like a zoo, and they scared to come through
Got a truck in your train, when you enter the zoo
You tired to get touch, stay out to come up
My hood like a jungle, we count it up
We got the right square, I send em in pair
If you the real street nigga, you don't play fair

We get money of lean and we move to white squares
