[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
East Atlanta slums, yeah, that's where I come from
Pop that bubble cush, and put some on your toung
Now everything was great, until your bitch came in
Bout the same time that thang get lit
Her face ain't too pretty, but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up, thinkin of bussin her body
Go back to your trailer, cause you look like Joseph Jackson
I'm on three double stacks, and I'm lookin for that action
Gucci Mane, you stupid mane, I love the way you flowin
Riding in my drop, but I don't know where I'm going
On 2 85, I be ridin in the Serka
This side, I spend time drinking that purple
Gucci show time, in like 5 more minutes
I'm gonna cool on juice, cause I'm really really trippin
Went to the strip club, then requested I'm the man
The next thing you know, I was throwin rubber bands

[Hook: Macboney and Gucci Mane]
Is you rollin, is you rollin
Is you rollin, bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Bitch, I might be, bitch, I might be

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
She always tellin me, she ain't ever sucked a dick
Never took a pill, or never ate a bitch
You a lier, but I ain't gon get upset right now
But I wish I had a lot of types of techs right now
You say your man a bitch, he might be
But I bet your husband ain't icey like me
Keep standing on BC, in my ash and black t
Got them dope man Nikes, and them Jordan jeans
Got paper, but I still keep that Threx on me
I'm the shit in East Atlanta, baby, ask about me
Pop 1, pop 2, 2 halves, that's 3
Ain't no Wafel House, baby, eat like KD
Gucci good like your hood, man, he's so street
Wearin doces in the club, cause you know the boy geeked
Drop the top on the thang, let you see my seets
We been rollin, rollin, rollin, and we ain't slept in weeks

[Hook: Macboney and Gucci Mane]
Is you rollin, is you rollin
Is you rollin, bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Bitch, I might be, bitch, I might be

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane LaFlare, nigga, get yo mind right
Order Krisp by the 12, like I'm kissin Bud Light
Sell cush by the bell, so you know my shit tight
7:30 in the morning, then an all night flight
I'm high like Fabo, hood like Shaudy
So tell me where to go, like my name E-40
A rich rockstar, nigga, I'm goin party
Got a party pack of pills, that's at least bout 40A bomb in your hand like like a pack of jellybeans
Take 4 these pills, call me in the morning
50,000 pills
Man, I'm so real
$3 for a pill, that's a damb good deal

[Hook: Macboney and Gucci Mane]

Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
