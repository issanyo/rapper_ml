[Jermaine Dupri:]
I'm bout to teach Mariah how to yeet

[Vamp:]
I can't wait to h-a-t-e you 'cause right now I need you
I can't wait to make you go (boy, you should know that)
I can't wait to h-a-t-e you 'cause right now I need you
I can't wait to make you go (boy, you should know that)

[Chorus 1:]
I can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to breakthrough these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause

[Chorus 2:]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady maybe
I still love you, boo
Can't wait to hate you
I just can't go on 'cause I gave my all to you

[Verse 1:]
Oh this was a love phenomenon that no one could explain
And I wish I could press reset
And feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind and watch us every night
Wanna pause it, but I can't make you stay (Just gotta let it play)
We went round for round 'til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring not making a sound
And I just wanna hold you, touch you, feel you, be near you
I miss you, baby baby
I'm tired of trying to fake through
But there's nothing I can do
Boy I can't wait to hate you

[Chorus:]
I can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to breakthrough these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause

[OJ Da Juiceman:]
Ooh, shawty hate me
No longer wants to date me
She say that I'm a lost cause
She even hate my dirty drawers
Try to keep it real
Every time she try to shake me off
I'm okay, I'll be good
Every day, filet mignon
H-A-T-E on Young Juice
But you can't leave the Juiceman alone
Every time I come around
You sneak and try to use your phone
Girl, you should know that
Juiceman ride around on this chrome
Insane jewelry dirty pinky
Half a million on my home

Boy, you should know that

[Chorus 2]

[Big Boi:]
I can't wait to hate, no escape
The situation is not that great
I know we ain't A-1
There's a lot at stake
Hear what I say, hon
Since day one, I was the real deal
No beef, just me and this whip appeal
Chill, I just wanna peel off in the whip
Feel me? Before somebody gets killed
Really? I kinda see, with all the spilled milk
That that cat get it up
This time, no regrets, no worries
Snow flurries, no blizzards
Cold shoulder, cold blooded, snow lizard
And now that I'm older
I told her to go find something to play with
I'm colder than a polar bear's toenails
Then I showed her to the door, player

[Gucci Mane:]
Yellow like my Lamborghini
Got her in a wet bikini
So much money, make a wish
I can be your Dream Of Jeannie
Many, plenty women did me
So much jewelry they should clone me
Got her girlfriends hating on me
She can't wait to leave me lonely
Phantoms in Atlanta, madame
[?] we such a major, tell 'em
Incense, oils, and scented candles
Leave me? You'll be crazy, baby
Me, you, can go crazy places
Fly you, buy you crazy bracelets
Lately I've been working crazy
I know that you're waiting patient
Bet at night you think of me
If I was you, I'd [?]
I was out there chasing money
I feel you ironically
Gucci Mane make money [?]
All these boys be hating on me
I thought you'd stay down with me
You got me back in these streets

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
