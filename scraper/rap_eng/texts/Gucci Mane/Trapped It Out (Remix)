I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I'm really living what I'm rapping 'bout
It ain't nothin' for me to cap about
All my life I had to trap it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out

It ain't nothin' for me to cap about
All my life I had to trap it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out

[Verse 1: Lotto Savage]
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap going crazy
Junkie heat the dope, fiendin' for the blow
Nosey old neighbor (double up)
Keep on calling twelve while pushing bail
Someone gon' pay up
Pour up the 4's and the lemonade while
We cook up in the microwave
TMT, Slaughter Gang
Gotta keep the choppa by the door
Fourty in the sofa, I've been whippin' soda
Plug came in with the pains
Drop it in the soda, got me leanin' over
Beat the block, and gotta feed the block
Think of it like the pyramid
Selling ice cream to a dope fiend
Buying ice cream for the children

[Hook: Lotto Savage]
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out

All my life I had to trap it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out
I took your whole house and I trapped it out

All my life I had to trap it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Pistols and pints and shit
Bezel the danky shit
I started this gangster shit
Now this is the thanks I get?
My closest partners are robbers
I'm in love with revolvers
Go cross your head with a bottle nigga if we got a problem
Hit so many licks
Sold so many bricks
I could build me a building
I helped so many jits
Made so many hits
That all the rappers my children
She talk a lot of shit
My kind of bitch
Young and thick and got children
Junkies coming quick
Trapped out this shit
Tryna make me a million
