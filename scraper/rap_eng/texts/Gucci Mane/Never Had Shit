But I ain’t never had shit I ain’t never had shit
Had a lot of bags I ain’t never had shit
My wrist cost this and my watch cost this
And my bitch like this and .. like this

Stunting on these hoes  I ain’t never had shit

[Verse 1: Gucci mane]
My bitch real bad and my car real fast
Her neck and ears glass and it cost real cash
She ain’t never had shit I ain’t never had shit
She a top notch bitch I’m a top notch nigga gotta top notch club
Rich nigga rich white folks rich
Got the type of money could take a white man bitch
Man I’m up on these inggas had to ice my wrist man

So turns up that I can never turn down
Remember me and four going in on a pound
Now I’m stunting on these hoes while my boy locked down

Clique full of soliders don’t make my niggas stop rushing
