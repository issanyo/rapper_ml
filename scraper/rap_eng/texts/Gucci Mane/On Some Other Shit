[Verse 1: Future]
I got product in two weeks
Got a main girl ain’t called in 4 days
All my freaks go both ways, yeah all my bitch go both ways
Rooms in Miami at the Fountain Blue
Yellow diamonds mountain Dew
Got a penthouse with a pretty view
So I can see all the bullshit I been through
I do the highways in the last lane
Freebandz thats a cash gang
Bird money, exchange
Foreign coupes with no brain
Stupid head got a stupid wrist
Stupid packs bring a stupid sack
Big faces don’t come alive
A hundred racks that's Frankenstein
Buy a whip just to trick it out, spending’ cash even in the drought
Take ya bitch from ya never take her out
Finesse king need a extra speed
Move Future, I'm on Jetski's
I take my other bitch, overseas
I’m a astronaut forever nigga
And I can change the weather nigga

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Where my top at I left it at the dealership
The dealer need some help cause he still countin’ chips
Like the boy frankenstein I make ya come alive
Put my steering wheel on the other side
I be on some other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some other shit, I be on some, I be on some
I be on some other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some other shit

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
My bank roll on roids, I got so much cash
And my pants that I'm guaranteed to show my ass
Yeah my attitude horrible, and my diamonds adorable (Brr)
Put my top in the garbage, baby catch me in traffic
She seen what I drive, she say aye its a lie
Like Frankenstein I'mma help her survive
I see the hate in your eyes, you a lame in disguise
I fired my driver yesterday good help is so hard to find
I'm like Macguyver I done got into it so many times
Like a sky diver in the sky but I’m like ten times as fly
My car shop has a pocket knife
So a hundred dollars my pocket price
You standing by the bar tonight, so I’m buying out the bar tonight

[Hook: Gucci]
Where my top at I left it at the dealership
The dealer need some help cause he still countin’ chips
Like the boy frankenstein I make ya come alive
Put my steering wheel on the other side
I be on some other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some I be on some, I be on some
Other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some other shit

[Verse 3: Future + Gucci]
I make movies drank easter, I go hard on my tracks
But I go dumb on these features
The whip gon' creep like a creature
And I got goons that got eat ya, I gotta keep my lean slimy
Cause you niggas are grimy, and I can’t see what the time is
Cause the diamonds around it
It's standing up like the preacher
Hide you in back with the speakers because you niggas is sneaky
You should salute when you see me cause its So Icy to greet me
And if you stand in between us you'll smell a whole lotta reefer

[Hook: Gucci]
Where my top at I left it at the dealership
The dealer need some help cause he still countin’ chips
Like the boy frankenstein I make ya come alive
Put my steering wheel on the other side
I be on some other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some I be on some, I be on some
Other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some other shit, I be on some other shit
I be on some other shit
