[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's a shark in the building, it's a shark in the building
Think the FBI is after me, a shark in the building
It's a shark in the building, it's a shark in the building
Get your gun and run for cover, it's a shark in the building
It's a shark in the building, you got a murder charge, homie, I know the feeling
It's a shark in the building, you drive a red Mozarati, I know the feeling

[Verse 2: ManMan Savage]
Guwop smoke with me, I pull up with a Grenade launcher
Young nigga with a pistol, pull up with my lil homie
I got young niggas ready to push up on ya, big homie
Young nigga Swiss cheese, turn your ass to Baloney
I know the feds still after me, I just got out of a shootout, dog
I know Dolph still ride with me, I'm lke a shark out the water, dog
I got sharks up in the building, yeah, they came with me
All these bitches independent, yeah they come for me
I'm hotter than the summer, a hundred degrees
The way me and Guwop shot that man, should've got a degree
I make bigger moves slow fly, hit you with that burner
Them shots hot, yeah them bitches, they goin burn ya
Do a drive by on your corner
I just killed the pussy, mama, sorry bout your daughter
My trigger finger happy, I think I've gotta disown it
Put that shit on camera, got that shit on recording
Can't call the FBI, cause my side killed the reporter
A shark up in the building, can't put him back in the water
