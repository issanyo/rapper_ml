On everything the streets will never be the same
Petty niggas snitching just for pocket change
I rearrange the game and build my own lane
I’m all about the money motherfuckin’ fame
I came out with a hustler, made myself a star
I was 20 years old with three foreign cars
… 20 000 weren’t for real diamonds
Wasn’t in the rap game, in the streets grindin’
Scooter took over now …
You think I should’ve tare the folds the day I sold you that
But I ain’t sold you none nigga, I drilled how to sell
From San Diego to Atlanta I got flying pass
Free bricks, free bricks

I … my own will, all my cars got …
Still shoppin’ at … ‘cause you eat and dig like real steal
Takin’ hoes on field trips, do you know I pay lil’ …
I’ma hoe is Cecelia, … the million
I got money, I sold dollars, I miss money, I shit money
Take youngers with … and niggas can’t take shit from them
Try me and you punished … your bitch mammy
You get cuttin’ I get guttin’
Back down from no one, got one and I got one
Take one to know one get shot down for my shotgun
Amigo you treatin’ those, T-lows we miss those
From the hood, on the 6th, I got free bridge for my ten fold
