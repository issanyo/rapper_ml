[Intro: Dreezy + Gucci Mane]
Yo!
Guwop!
Yeah
Dreezy!
Gucci!
Welcome home!

[Hook: Dreezy]
That's my nigga, that's my bro, yeah that's my dog (Aye, thats my nigga)
If niggas wanna get it bussin', he on call (he gon pull up)
He gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
Yeah we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off (Aye we gon' ride)
That's my BF, that's my day one, that's my bitch (Dat my bitch)
You tryna tee up then you know we with the shits (With the shits)
She gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off (True)
Yeah we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off

[Verse 1: Dreezy]
Me and my bitches stick together like the Bradys
Run up on us, we won't save, we play crazy
All my niggas off them yoppas like the '80s
And they ain't tryna go to rehab, just like Amy
I just want me and my bitches in a foreign back to back
Used to post up at the trap and now we got a P to match
Pull up with my hypeman, but he don't rap, he just strapped
And they stomp you like a fret if any nigga try to cap
Ice and grips and takin' trips, might cop a zip and make it flip
R.I.P. to Double G, she kept a P and that was it
Treat my bitches like my holster cause they're always on my hip
In V.I.P., I'm with the shits, I cop a trey, she cop a fifth
That's my bitch!

[Hook: Dreezy]
That's my nigga, that's my bro, yeah that's my dog (That's my dog)
If niggas wanna get it bussin', he on call (He gon pull up)
He gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
Yeah we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off (Aye we gon what?)
That's my BF, that's my day one, that's my bitch (That's my bitch)
You tryna tee up then you know we with the shits
She gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
Yeah we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Uh, Yeah, Dreezy!
Call me Gucci the Don, jump on, I'm on the run
Told my mama kill 'em so I'm a son of a gun
And my dad is a hustler so I'm a son of a con
And from sun-up to dawn, I won't surrender or run
Call me GuWop the legend, Cocaine King, they a legend
MAC 11, I ride, keep shooters at every session
I'm ahead of my time, I blast into the present
Bitch it's Dreezy and Gucci, Dreezy pass me the Uzis
I'm not skressed out, no pressure, man I'm fresher than ever
I'm too slick to be slippin', can't count me out, I'm too clever
Schizophrenic when paid, come to money, I manic
Count a bulk by the cabbage, I'm Macho Man Randy Savage
It's Gucci!

[Hook: Dreezy]
That's my nigga, that's my bro, yeah that's my dog
If niggas wanna get it bussin', he on call
He gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
Yeah we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
That's my BF, that's my day one, that's my bitch
You tryna tee up then you know we with the shits
She gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
Yeah we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off

[Verse 3: Dreezy]
I put traps in all my bloods and show these niggas no love
Up a roll and it don't fold, I got new hundreds, no dubs
Got this shit up out the mud but I remember we used to juug
With some thugs and they shoot like Elmer Fudd
Yeah, pull up on you just for sayin' somethin'
Swear I'll throw a tantrum
If you been gettin' it with your best friend, this your anthem
Still the same bitch, won't see me out here with no random
Now we on the road and I'm stickin' to the code
Way before we touched the bag we still was makin' bitches mad
Not in class, but they still congratulate me like a grad
Out here beefin' with your day one over these niggas and it's sad
Nah we don't fall out, nigga, we just ball out
Ayy!

[Hook: Dreezy]
That's my nigga, that's my bro, yeah that's my dog
If niggas wanna get it bussin', he on call
He gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
Yeah we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
That's my BF, that's my day one, that's my bitch
You tryna tee up then you know we with the shits
She gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
Yeah we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off

[Outro: Dreezy]
Who I sound like now, bitch?
