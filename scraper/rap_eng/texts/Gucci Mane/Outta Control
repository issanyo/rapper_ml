[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane and Jeremih see fine too fly
You a damn liar
I stayed higher than a fucking flyer
You stay up like gun powder
Shawty lock on like a plier
She OC she crazy, her shoe game is amazing
And a bad game is blazing
Put some days in with the stray in
I flew her in for the weekend
Can't even remember where we began
But I hope that the shit don't end
She so cool she bring friends
Matthew shoe, crystalline dance
We lock him but we spiked out
Got a course seen that you sparkle in
King of every day like Jet Li
Ten diamond change like Mr.T
We the real 3 no mistery
Only bang on the baby she missing me
Tell her boyfriend is history
Beat the pussy up no sympathy
On the highway to the drive way
Well it's hard to drive 'cause she all over me
Gucci Mane and Jeremih see fine too fly
You a damn liar
I stayed higher than a fucking flyer
You stay up like gun powder
Shawty lock on like a plier
She OC she crazy, her shoe game is amazing
And a bad game is blazing
Put some days in with the stray in
I flew her in for the weekend
Can't even remember where we began
But I hope that the shit don't end
She so cool she bring friends
Matthew shoe, crystalline dance
We lock him but we spiked out
Got a course seen that you sparkle in
King of every day like Jet Li
Ten diamond change like Mr.T
We the real 3 no mistery
Only bang on the baby she missing me
Tell her boyfriend is history
Beat the pussy up no sympathy
On the highway to the drive way
Well it's hard to drive 'cause she all over me

[Chorus]
She ain't the little girl I used to know
Got in the body got them beating in the soul
I gave it to relax the time she tried to let it go
Headed for destruction and everybody know
She outta control, she-she outta control
She outta control, she-she outta control
She outta control

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
What's your name, shawty
Where you from, up
You fine as hell
Your skin tone is honey bun
Like a basketball
We can do this one on one
I gotta love Jones
I'm the rest hey, see get along
She page calling my booty phone
She need me, won't be alone
Say her old boyfriend's at
Cheating on Bambino
And so now on hold she calling
She at me, she fallin'
Page mistakes she stay too long
My bubble with no brakes out of control
Brakes out of control

[Chorus]
She ain't the little girl I used to know
Got in the body got them beating in the soul
I gave it to relax the time she tried to let it go
Headed for destruction and everybody know
She outta control, she-she outta control
She outta control, she-she outta control
She outta control

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
She outta control, she on the Patrone
She told me that she love me
I said I love you more
I gotta end my sweet, I said sup, my swag
You call it face time, I call it ipad
She be running through my mind, 40 on cash
I'm the type to fire new crib in old glass
I'm the type to fire new car in all cash
Potato I'm a mash I like girls with an ass on

[Chorus]
She ain't the little girl I used to know
Got in the body got them beating in the soul
I gave it to relax the time she tried to let it go
Headed for destruction and everybody know
She outta control
