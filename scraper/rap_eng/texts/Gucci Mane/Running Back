(Intro): Uh, uh man, hey, good kush, this kush is perfect
I'm really smokin', DJ Speedy's track perfect, really perfect
So Icey we perfect, my record label is perfect. Uh!

(Chorus): Run it back just like I'm a running back
While my diamonds doin' jumpin' jacks my pockets gettin' fat
I'm gettin' fat, obese, I won't stop man I just keep eatin'
Dear meat let's feast, dear Lord I thank you for this beef
Dear meat let's feast, oh Lord thank you for this beef

(Verse 1): It's no sweat but I keep good keef
That strong loud kush, they call it Irene
16 with about 10 G's and Spike Lee was screamin' do the right thing
Not us, not me, got 4 knots in my Guess jeans
And my chain is 1 mill' that's 1 mill' more than your deal
I'm so trill (so trill) large bills
I'm sittin' tall, grill it come from Paul Wall
Cocaina shawty yeah I keep the Paul Wall
The Lil Wayne, The Eminem, you know the 8 mile, Gucci

(Chorus)

Now it don't stop 'til the fat girl sings
When it's over hit em' wit' the violins
Bring the beat back, do you like the violins?
Matter of fact drop the beat and play the strings
Bring the beat back
Beat so hard I ain't gotta say a thing
1 mane, 2 chains, 3 knots and 4 rings
8 please, excuse me, that's 4 on both hands
I'm Mr. perfect mane bang bang Gucci Mane, Gucci!

(Chorus)

This for my lil' brother Nate, he ain't even 13
Tell Megan uncle Gucci say good and stay sweet
Like my children and my auntie, my niece is pretty
Love my momma more than my Hummer on Ashanti
Love my brother 50 and I know that nigga love me
Love walker Wood Warren, R.I.P. to Raliegh
Shout out to uncle Joe and my uncle Bentley
Speedy beat box on the track, take us to Jamica Queens
(Beatbox)
Go, go, go head drop the strings, Gucci

(Chorus x2)
