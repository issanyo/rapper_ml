Haters got me wrong

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Early in the morning
I daydream cuz I'm locked down
And I can't help but
To reminisce about when I was back in H-Town
When I was ridin candy blue piece and chain hangin' doin my thang in R-A-P
But now I can't help but to wonder if God has forgotten about me
I can still taste the juicy sour
And ain't never been too sweet
And I never did nothing to nobody just tried to stay up on my feet
Why does it seem like everybody wanna see me B-R-O-K-E
Ya'll can eat a meaty dick baby
I know you wanna see me fall but I want it all
Man you haters got me wrong

[Hook: x2]
Haters got me wrong

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I know this boy he used to hate on me
This girl who still be hatin' on me
Mad cuz I'm successful and my schedule filled with making money
Man I hate these haters homie
Damn I hate these haters homie
If I was you I'd hate me homie
Why you think I make it funny
When I was locked in Fulton County
Bitch you wasn't thinking 'bout me
From my hood but niggas in
My hood still be soft shawty
I'm gon' put you on some doper job or deal or loan shawty
Please leave me alone
Hold your own
Cuz your grown
Be your own
Not a clone
Yeah it's Big Gucci and Z-Ro
You haters actin stupid
Pockets on gas like
Need some fuel to it
Flash back '99
Techs go on the ground
Go 'round 9-5
Air mats in your house
Fast forward
Rolls Royce paid for
Cuz this is only motherfucker hating
Man that can't afford accessories necessities
This is our way to Texas
And you haters need congratulation
Stop that being jealous
Gucci Gucci

[Verse 3: Chris Ward]
These haters got me wrong
These haters got me on
My job is the boss of the mob
That's why I got these gators on
They keeps me motivated
Cuz this game is so so shady
That's why I smile at them
To let them know I know they hate it
This being trill like we trill is kinda overrated
But we ain't fucked up about it
Cuz we know they babies
Full time on the climb with mine
Every time I rhyme I shine
See the paints see the swangs
See the rings see the chains
Diamond Don
Every time you haters awake
It's like I'm on your mind
But every time I'm awake
Haters I'm on the grind
So how can you not like the C dot W-A-R-D
Why you want me dead or in jail or out here living horribly
Is it cuz that girl you love is on my dick and adoring me
Or that video you hate is blowing up and it's starring we
Well I can't lie I'm just doing my thang
I'm just doing I'm just doing I'm just doing my thang
Keep your hate up
