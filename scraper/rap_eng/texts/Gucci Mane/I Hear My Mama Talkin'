[Chorus]
Here come them people, got me running, tryna they surround me
And out of nowhere in my head, I hear my mama talkin'
She told me quick money go send go send yo ass report to prison
And on some real Chicken Talk I think I should've listened
I'm Radric Davis but the ladies call me Gucci baby
I close my sometimes at night I hear my mama praying
I'm Radric Davis but the ladies call me Gucci baby
I close my sometimes at night I hear my mama praying

[Verse 1]
Real talk my first car was a Regal
Mama couldn't help me, so I bought the bitch myself
I cut my music up loud, the neighbors called 12
I'm just a young nigga gotta let the trunk wham
I took the hubcaps off and bought the gold rims
I'm 17 riding cleaner than your husband
There's nothing greater, bouncing, swerving, whippin thru Decatur
I blowed the brains out now, my high school homeboys turn to haters
Sophmore year Gucci fucking seniors
She's a doctor now, but Gucci fucked her by the bleachers
My mama told me son that one day boy you'll be a lawyer
I listened to her but I still went back on the corner

[Chorus]
