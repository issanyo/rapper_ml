I got a iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
A iced out bart where my heart used to be
I scratch off on a bitch it's nothing to me

[Verse 1]
I got a iced out bart where my heart at
Got multi colored diamond clothing
Shorty it's all that
New pinky ring
Zay, What do you call dat?
I call it Smurfette
Papa Smurf is the bracelet
VVS very very slight flawsless
$20, 000 just to get every stone set
Call my ex girl and she ain't hung that phone yet
I hit her best friend now she screaming she upset
Better watch out cause your girlfriend Nicole next
See I got a iced out bart where my heart at
She started it
Bitch did'nt know how hard the kid did what he did just to feed this damn bitch (It's Gucci)

[Verse 2]
I put a diamond in the place of my heart, Zay
Even Jay-Z fell in love with Beyonce'
So, Niggas like me will fuck a hoe on the first date
Then scratch couple hundreds... It's nothing
I keep a bank roll ask your friend am I bluffin'
She den turn you on to the dick cause she cuffin'
She blushin'... Cause she know It's Gucci LaFlare
And when you got something good you wanna keep it to yourself (It's Gucci)
