[Intro: OMB Peezy]
Look, the bottom ain't no place for me
Mama pray for me
Prison ain't no place for me
Look, look

[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Mama pray for me
Prison ain't no place for me
But I gotta keep that iron
'Cause my shine they wanna take from me
Work my way to the top
Because the bottom ain't the place for me
(Bottom ain't the place to be) The bottom ain't the place for me

[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Mama pray for me
Prison ain't the place for me
But I gotta keep that iron
'Cause my shine they wanna take from me
Work my way to the top
Because the bottom ain't the place for me
(Bottom ain't the place for me) The bottom ain't the place to be

[Verse 1: OMB Peezy]
Hate being broke, that shit ain't for me
Even if I gotta kick a door
And them folks tryna put a case on me
Beating it like Adam Snow
Let a nigga go, they don't wanna let a nigga breathe
It feel like I'm gettin' choked
Never been a hoe, Told my momma pray for me
In that water without a float
Never arguing about a hoe
When all of my boys been up in her throat
Try one of my boys, I'm lettin' it blow
At the top I ain't stressin' no more
I remember my bed was the floor
Now I'm in your bed gettin' head from your hoe
I then took so many losses
You better not try me I'm ready to go
Momma pray for me
'Cause these streets ain't the place to be
But I love 'em and I keep a tool
'Cause ain't no nigga takin' me
Ain't no breakin' me
From Mobile where it ain't no peace
Plottin' on a milli 'til I get it boy it ain't no sleep

[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Mama pray for me
Prison ain't no place for me
But I gotta keep that iron
'Cause my shine they wanna take from me
Work my way to the top
Because the bottom ain't the place to be
(Bottom ain't the place to be)
No, the bottom ain't the place for me

[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Mama pray for me
Prison ain't the place for me
But I gotta keep that iron
'Cause my shine they wanna take from me
Work my way to the top
Because the bottom ain't the place for me
(Bottom ain't the place for me)
Look, the bottom ain't the place to be

[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Mama pray for me
Prison ain't no place for me
But I gotta keep that iron
'Cause my shine they wanna take from me
Work my way to the top
Because the bottom ain't the place to be (swizzo)
(Bottom ain't the place to be)
No, the bottom ain't the place for me

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane on the Adam Snow tracks
Standin' over the stove
Whippin' up half to a hoe
Spend some bread then make some more
One on one they broke the mold
On probation, fifth parole
I was sellin' bells and [?]s
Tryina [?] some [?]s
LA with Jeffe, CEO the checks say
2 mil my neck say, Fly to GA next day
[?] Gucci, I got [?] now and next Gucci
Artists tryna clone, tryna be the next Gucci
Trap god, choppa in my lap god
Adam made the track hard, I could still whip crack hard
Momma pray for me, prison ain't no place for me
I had chasin' currency, 'cause money ain't gonna wait for me

[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Mama pray for me
Prison ain't no place for me
But I gotta keep that iron
'Cause my shine they wanna take from me
Work my way to the top
Because the bottom ain't the place to be
(Bottom ain't the place to be)
No, the bottom ain't the place for me

[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Mama pray for me
Prison ain't the place for me
But I gotta keep that iron
'Cause my shine they wanna take from me
Work my way to the top
Because the bottom ain't the place for me
(Bottom ain't the place for me)
Look, the bottom ain't the place to be

[Outro: OMB Peezy]
Mama pray for me
Prison ain't no place for me
But I gotta keep that iron
'Cause my shine they wanna take from me
Work my way to the top
Because the bottom ain't the place to be
I know the bottom ain't the place for me
