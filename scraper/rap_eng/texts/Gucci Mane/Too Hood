[Intro]
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
He's so hood, he's so damn hood

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Come help me mow yo lawn, mama, turn you up into a soldier
Head to the dreams, and your pretty legs on my shoulders
So don't lie to me I know you're scared of me
You ain't gotta be, cuz I'll have yo back as long as you stay on top of me
First I let her drive me (nyum), then I make her ride me (nyum)
She change her hair like every day like she miss Dennis Rodman
Say paying wit yo waist, shit, she can overcharge
Still rough around the edges, but money's not a problem
Take it to the hood, move out the hood, but I park the booth, got a pocketbook
Then I call the jeweler, bring the cooler, make it look like Gucci look (burr)
Shawty got a mean swag, I wanna fuck with her
She don't need no lame nigga
She need a thug nigga

[Hook 1: Ciara & Gucci Mane]
I ain't gotta worry about nothing
He's makin' trouble, always give me something
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Down, keep it so right, and he do it good

I'm too hood for my own good
But we can ball to the mall down, it's all good
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Crazy guy, but too hood for his own good

[Verse 2: Gucci Maine]
She know I like to smoke, love to gamble
I'm in my hood sittin' low in my Lambo (nyum)
And we can be a duo, a tandem
Come through Atlanta in back to back Phantom
Her mama like he ain't got no manners
But her mama like "damn, Gucci, handosme"
It's a date night, yeah I got my cake right
The diamonds in the air, flashin' brighter, that's some brake lights
No I'm not a trouble maker, I just make it double take (burr)
Shawty staring at me, but it's something make her hesitate
Maybe it's my reputation, maybe it's my entourage
I'm straight out the hood, but ain't no need to try to camouflage

[Hook 2: Gucci Mane & Ciara]
She ain't gotta worry (worry for nothing)
I hold it down, she too much for you suckers

She's hanging off in jewelry all on her
And all the girls want him, so you can tell them nothin
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
He's so hood, he's too hood for his own good
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Crazy guy, but too hood for his own good

[Bridge: Ciara]
Keep it til' you die, but you can't be sick
Start rootin' for it, can't put it down like this
Find them in the (sun), find them in the 6
Find them in the air, somewhere in the bricks
Keep it til' you die, but you can't be sick
Start rootin' for it, can't put it down like this
Find them in the room, find them in the bay
Find them in New York, find them in L.A

[Hook 2]
