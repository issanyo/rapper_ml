[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Aye man check this shit out man
This just for the record man
That nigga Young Jeezy, that nigga fake man
That nigga is not a thug man
That niggas a wanksta man, I mean gangsta
Actor, I mean rapper
NBC, I mean CTE
Fuck them niggas
Finna get outta here

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
The dope game hard
The rap game easy
This is round one of Gucci Mane vs Jeezy
Gucci Mane vs Jeezy
This is round 1 of Gucci Mane vs
(x2)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm the East Atlanta boss
Dirty South like Slim Thugga
Jeezy can make a hit with a Louisville slugga
Slap hoes, cane pimps, No Slick Pulla
Punch Kinky B dead in his dick sucka
Poppin' on the radio, boy that's a bitch there
Ridin round with HB, smokin' on the cheap junk
Played you on a verse, cause I know you was a big crab
Paid Lil Will to sing the hook for a 50 slab
Did investigations, now I know ya background
Heard you from Hawkinsville, 30 miles from Mac Town
Think you got a buzz cause you known at Strokers?
Got 3 deals but the nigga still local

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
The dope game hard
The rap game easy
This is round one of Gucci Mane vs Jeezy
Gucci Mane vs Jeezy
This is round 1 of Gucci Mane vs
(x2)

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
Yous a perfect example of what a crab is
Choppa hit ya, make ya scream out ya adlibs
Yeeeaahhhh, Let's get it!
Gucci voice on it then the hood gon feel it
(x2)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
That 645 he leasing it
In Icy video wearing Meech's shit
3 cents off a album what Jeezy gets
Put a dress on nigga, you Meech's bitch
You a thug impostor
You deserve an Oscar
Album ain't hot, Def Jam finna drop ya
Hangin round the Ball Park
Claimin you from Boulevard
Oh that Ferrari, you bought that shit from Pull-A-Part
Nun to lose, nun to prove
Might as well beef witcha, nothing better to do
Think ya on cause ya brung yourself a bird or two?
Outside 285 no one has heard of you

[Verse 3: Black Magic]
You can check my Glock work, pussy you ain't got these
Mac 11's, HK's, Carbon 15's
I got some lil niggas shooting, only 16s
They don't ask questions
They just shoot till the clip clean
Now let me tell yall something quick
That fat nigga he dissed
Fuck around and say the word
His ass is 6"6
And imma treat his ass just like a bitch
So all that text message banging ain't the trade of a Crip
I got the hundred round clip, with the Mac 10 under my trench coat
If I don't find Jeezy
I can always catch Coach
Popping all that shit, spreading "he say, she say"
Gon earn you a gangsta in ya grill like ya DJ
My whole team RD, flags on the leftside
Gucci got the East
Black Mag on the westside
You Def Jammin with that fat limp nigga
Ya both A.S.S. so you belong with Jigga

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
The dope game hard
The rap game easy
This is round one of Gucci Mane vs Jeezy
Gucci Mane vs Jeezy
This is round 1 of Gucci Mane vs
