Verse 1 (Gucci Mane):

Please excuse me for being a G, that's just the way they raised me
I ball so bad, I pay for it, I want to see her naked
She shaken like she got a seizure, shorty goin' crazy
Datin' all kinds of important people, her swag is amazing
Wanna go to Costa Rica? Kick around and play it?
We could just-a stay in or I could take you shopping
Corporate smoking pounds of reefer but I got a make it
Hate on me, no snitchin' either, I'm just trying to make cents
Can you get me cocainia? I'll tell you to take it
Rest of them toy desert eagles, ak - she be fakin'
Role my blunts in deuces cause I'm so very impatient
Meet em, then I greet em, then I bust all in their faces

Hook (Gucci Mane):

Jumpin' out the Range Rover, I popped a box spring
He fucked her then he tagged me. We call it tag team
Fuckin' bitches after shows. We call it tag team
Fuckin' bitches on the road.  We call it tag team
(repeat x 2)

Verse 2 (Waka Flacka Flame)

I'm diggin' that mix, tag team with the right hand
Make me a Sprite and I'm going all night man
Gucci got the front, so you know I gotta get the back
Give that ass a smack, for a fact. She gonna throw it back
Dick in her hand, like spit on that
The lil' purdy lil' thing put kids on that

Girl, I want that pussy.  Girl, gimme that
Got have that.  Long hair, ass fat
You know you wanna nigga like me
Dread-head, tats and some gold teeth

All the sights on me, I can't get girls up off of me
I'm a stone cold stunner call me Flacka
All that shake, do it come with fries?
The way you twerk that ass, got a nigga crosseyed

Hook (x 2)
