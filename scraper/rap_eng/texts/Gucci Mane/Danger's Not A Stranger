[Hook]
You know I’m a gangster
So danger’s not a stranger
I keep one in the chamber
And I’m dizzy when I’m anger

I‘ll put you in the paper
I’ll send you to your maker
Then retreat to Jamaica
It die down, I'll be back later

[Verse 1]
All gangsters toe strap to this
Pussies in the club get slapped to this
Sucka ass niggas don’t rock to this
And if you ain’t a real nigga don’t play my dis

I’m Gucci Mane LaFlare I’ll blast the bitch
Then put me on the stand I’mma plead the fifth
I’mma merc' this track here on the script
Studio gangsters, don’t rock with them

He say he know me, but I don’t rock with him
And my partner know I keep my chopper, pimp
I’m silverback gorilla you're just a chimp
Better yet you’re a chump (?) —Sgucci!

[Hook]
You know I’m a gangster
So danger’s not a stranger
I keep one in the chamber
And I’m dizzy when I’m anger

I‘ll put you in the paper
I’ll send you to your maker
Then retreat to Jamaica
It die down, I'll be back later

[Verse 2]
All the greatest (?) niggas move bricks to this
Zone Six niggas hit licks to this
Rich squad niggas toe strap the shit
This rubber spit quotes (?) are not accurate

Gucci Mane swag immaculate
I’m hard to figure out like calculus
My enemy pussy (?) like Malcolm X
To get to the top I got to get

You get in my way, then your head I’ll hit
With a hollow tip, nigga, I hardly miss
Niggas diss me, but I don’t (?) to this
I’ll pistol whip a nigga till his skull is split —Gucci!

[Hook]
You know I’m a gangster
So danger’s not a stranger
I keep one in the chamber
And I’m dizzy when I’m anger

I‘ll put you in the paper
I’ll send you to your maker
Then retreat to Jamaica
It die down, I'll be back later

[Verse 3]
Now I’m a take me back to my old ways
Running around think like the old days
Hit my lick playing The O Jay’s
Me and OJ, twin AKs

Do you really think I’m dead, man?
And I ain’t got hollow top lead, man?
Four shots all in your chest, man
Fuck around on that Cris', man

Talking all that fake talky-talk
That’s how you got your wack start
In my Phantom coupe just laughing
Me giving y’all a thought is the last thing

[Hook]
You know I’m a gangster
So danger’s not a stranger
I keep one in the chamber
And I’m dizzy when I’m anger

I‘ll put you in the paper
I’ll send you to your maker
Then retreat to Jamaica
It die down, I'll be back later

[Outro]
Shout out my nigga, Walker
My nigga, Woo

Whole East Atlanta
