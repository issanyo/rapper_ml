[Intro]
Can’t turn me down, Can’t turn me down
I never let a bad bitch turn me down

[Verse 1: Gucci]
Diamonds dancin’ on my wrist like they Chris Brown
They dancin' on my fist like they Chris Brown
Ain’t been out a month already on my sixth pound
Leanin' off this drank I need to sit down
Baddest bitches in the game they wanna get down
Fans crawlin’ on the stage they need to quit now
I was trappin' makin' it happen but now I'm rich now
Thinkin' to myself how much money can one man get now

[Hook: Gucci]
Can’t turn me down, Can’t turn me down
I hit the lot with stupid knots and double down
I'm double cupping look at me now
I never let a bad bitch turn me down
Can’t turn me down, Can’t turn me down
I hit the lot with stupid knots and double down
I’m double cupping look at me now
I never let a bad bitch turn me down

[Verse 2: Future]
I made a promise to myself that I’mma die rich (Astronaut)
My cup is polluted cause I’m on Actavis (lean)
And the way a nigga ballin’ is like a Athlete (fadeaway)
I got expensive habits, and I’m hard to reach
Cause I’m in Pluto, I’m double cupping’ on Dro
And I play the piano, my pockets on sumo
I’m plugged in with Migo, I can get a taco
And if you wanna cash out I bring it to your front door

[Hook: Gucci]
Can’t turn me down, Can’t turn me down
I hit the lot with stupid knots and double down
I’m double cupping look at me now
I never let a bad bitch turn me down
Can’t turn me down, Can’t turn me down
I hit the lot with stupid knots and double down
I’m double cupping look at me now
I never let a bad bitch turn me down

[Verse 3]
I fuck her til the neighbors tell me turn it down
But fuck the neighbors I’mma tell her turn around
They won’t talk enough money so I turned it down
Multi million dollar deal offer thats a turn around
Too turnt Up, ain’t no way to turn me down
I’m go hard, every day above the ground
Teach your dog old tricks she can learn it now
Take this work down town bitch and turn around

[Hook: Gucci]
Can’t turn me down, Can’t turn me down
I hit the lot with stupid knots and double down
I’m double cupping look at me now
I never let a bad bitch turn me down
Can’t turn me down, Can’t turn me down
I hit the lot with stupid knots and double down
I’m double cupping look at me now
I never let a bad bitch turn me down
