[Verse 1]
See my charm is very dumb
And my girlfriend 21
And I know that's kinda young and I only feed her crumbs
My jacob watch is short bus, man that's special ed
Cause the girls be droolin, everytime they see the VVS
Got a drop top vet and that thang so stupid
The rims are off the set
Girls be jumping in mah bed
I'm a a dog, I'm a St. Bernard
And that dick get hard as hell
We can leave the bed made up
I can fuck u on the chair
A boss bro, with dogs, man I don't fuck hoes with flees
Hundred fifty thousand dollar dog collars for the team
I'm a a boss bro, run with dogs, and I don't fuck hoes with flees (Go)
Hundred fifty thousand dollar dog collars for the team

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I got every kind of bitches droolin
On a nigga style
Cause my pockets fat, I smoke that thrax, while they blow Black n Milds
I hit the club with Zay, we in the front
All these niggas' bitches choosin
Gucci got em rollin so I know they down to shoot a movie
Niggas baller blockin hatin on a killa movement
Out the bed to grits and eggs head and sum booty
I'm young doing numbers
And all the women love me
Because I'm Gutta black, got a bank and I'm thuggin
I neva love a broad cause I'm a motherfuckin dog
You can ask a couple about me bet they tell you I'm off the wall
I got doctors, lawyers, dealers, even strippers, on my team
N I neva show favoritism everyone's treated the same
I'm a boss of all bitches, so they neva complainin
They respect this gangsta shit, cause I got so much game
You ain't gotta ask about me, nigha u know who I be
