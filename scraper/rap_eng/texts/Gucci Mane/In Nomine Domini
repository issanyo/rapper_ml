We have come with strength and vigour
We are stalwart as the tree
We will face the utmost rigour
In Nomine Domini
We are called to be your victors
We are called to set men free
We will face what’re awaits us, In Nomine Domini

In Nomine Domini we say
In Nomine Domini, each day
In Nomine Domini, we pray
In Nomine Domini

We have known the Lord’s great power
That he made the blind to see
That the dead are raised in glory
In Nomine Domini
And as we proclaim our valour
And our pride in Trinity
Know that everything’s accomplished
In Nomine Domini

In Nomine Domini we say
In Nomine Domini, each day
In Nomine Domini, we pray
In Nomine Domini
