[Verse 1: Taylor J]
I ask my momma why she hate my friends
She say they no good
Between me and all of em
We rob the whole hood
Fuck a class I got some knit
Stayed in the hallways
Now I never pay for zips
I came a long way
Rico say I smoke too much
I’m scared to see my lungs
Got some hoes with money now
Still got some in the slums
Riding round with all my tree
I got to get it nigga
All of this be gone by three
So what’s the ticket nigga
I’m the bad guy with a bad bitch with a nice ass and mad chips
We rollin weed in your mixtape, and I break it down on your tracklist
She got a boyfriend but he average
I spend a lot of my money with sacks fifth
I’m locked in on this rap shit
But I could still make a pack do a back flip
Fuck with me

[Hook: Taylor J]
I’m just riding round
Up to no good
I ain’t worried bout it
I’m good in yo hood
Couple different drugs on me
I might be yo plug
Might have a gun on me
I might hit yo mug
I’m just riding round
Up to no good
I ain’t worried bout it
I’m good in yo hood
Couple different drugs on me
I might be yo plug
Might have a gun on me
I might hit yo mug

[Verse 2: Dose]
I’m in these streets nigga
I’m bout that life partner
I got that thunder on me
Call that bitch Oklahoma
I got that work cooking
I know they smell the odor
I’m on that Miley Cyrus
I been there all morning
I got d’own head chopper, d’own head chopper
From the pawn shop
Eight under five men, call the ambulance, like the whole block
Lit up my left wrist, that’s every bit, about two block
Living that thug life, go against the grain like 2Pac
Ay I got horsepower, I smashed out on two cars
Vroom vroom, nigga give me room, got a foreign touring with a stash box
Stacked up with a bent and I blow half of that for the half nights
Prolly be in your hood with your goons on your block
Dose

[Hook: Taylor J]
I’m just riding round
Up to no good
I ain’t worried bout it
I’m good in yo hood
Couple different drugs on me
I might be yo plug
Might have a gun on me
I might hit yo mug

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I’m in the hood with a pound of good
Smoke up every bud
I’m an East Atlanta vet but sippin Mississippi mud
Fuck a ho, bitch I told her snuh
I shoot in the club
Got my vodkas they gon' keep a buzz
Tell it to the judge
I'm  the plug, Mr. such and such, cut off a nigga nuts
Selling kush like I’m in a rush
You snitches need to hush
She a slut, she just love to fuck, my diamonds make her blush
I need a rich bitch, tell Oprah Winfrey that I got a crush
If a pussy push me then up in my pistol is a must
If this AK hit em then it might just knock him out his chucks
I got this kush coming on this truck and I got these pints coming on this bus
And I got my truck locked down so tough that these niggas can’t even re-up
Gucci Mane, nigga look me up, six how much they bought me up
When I touch down I smoke pounds so street niggas can hook me up
Bitch your bitch wanna slide me up
I know the feds wanna snatch me up
Daffodil really gon doubt me up
Black on pussy, then smack me up

[Hook: Taylor J]
I’m just riding round
Up to no good
I ain’t worried bout it
I’m good in yo hood
Couple different drugs on me
I might be yo plug
Might have a gun on me
I might hit yo mug
