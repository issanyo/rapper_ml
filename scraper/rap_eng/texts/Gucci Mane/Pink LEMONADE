(Intro : Gucci Mane)
My Phantom sitting on sixes, no twenties in my denim
Your Cutlass motor knocking because it is a lemon
I like them Georgia peaches but you look more like a lemon
These sour apple bitter bitches I'm not fucking with 'em
I'm truly stupid paid, that's just how I feel today
I'm moving slow cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade
I'm standing in the shade and I'm selling lemonade
Six hundred a pint, the going rate off in the A
Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in your face
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday
I'm pimping wearing lemon, that's just how I'm chilling
I'm smoking grits and selling chickens, Corvette painted lemons


(Verse 1)
Diamonds in my teeth, shining on these bitches shade
Invite me over for dinner, watch me come 2 hours late
I didn’t wanna pull up, I was posted in the shade
Pink pepto bismol, after that food your momma made
I’m dressed in pastels bright like pink lemonade
Had my pink Fedora on oh, I swore my life is made
I needed something sweet he brought me  gatorade
I threw in his face, he thought this was a game
I need some iced pink lemonade I should not have to wait
My squad brings the heat, no Dwyane Wade
I don’t wanna see no opps so I close up my pink drapes
They don’t get my swag, I’m in the A out from LA
Tiva

(It's Gucci)
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemonade and shade with my feet up
Lemonade and shade with my feet up
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up

(Verse 2)
Yo, step into the streets rocking Puma Fenty Slippers
I wanna see the Lakers play, head to the staples center
Even if they lose bitch you know I’m still a Winner
I stole your man and made him eat the kitty out for dinner
Pink panther, pink pussy, pink margarita
Sip it on the beach, shawty smoking on that swisher
Turn a nigga down now he’s lemon with no sugar
Damn that’s kinda sad, didn’t mean to make him bitter
Queen T, oso sweet, pink diamonds glimmer
Sparkle like a diamond while I cry these tears of glitter
Soft pink baby girl go bad when I drink liquor
Fuck me over best believe you’ll become sad and sicker


Niggas think.. Yo clouts the same thing as fame, damn
Big headed... broke boy you such lame, yup
Squad of Bad bitches… popping champagne, yea
Call the uber, big- body ho stay in yo lane yah

Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts

Lemonade and shade with my feet up
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
