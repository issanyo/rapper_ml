[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Yeah
Yeah, good mornin', America
Huh, came so far
'Times just wake up, man
You know, just look at the water
Put on the water

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
The sun ain't even up yet, I'm thinkin' 'bout the check (Wop)
Woke up in the mornin', bust down me a brick
Gave Metro a million, told him not to quit (True)
East Atlanta, Zone 6, Gucci really rich (Rich)
Plus, they keep bud in the kitchen, fuck some eggs and grits
Jimmy Henchman with the shipment, I sold a lot of shit
Heard I killed a man allegedly, but I didn't bust a head (Hah)
The way they mixin' up the medicine, I might just grow some dreads (Uh)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's a bad bitch on the elevator, I'ma let her in
Let your hater be a motivator, I can't let you win
He a genius, human calculator, stack it by the ten
Put the Lambo on the elevator, bring it to the den
Put the Mustang by the balcony, I'm fly like Peter Pan
I'm so glad they turned they back on me 'cause we wasn't really friends (No)
And it ain't even ten and I woke up on a ten (Huh)
And I don't need no pen, no I don't need no pad (Wizop)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
The sun ain't even up yet, I'm thinkin' 'bout the check (Huh)
Woke up in the mornin', bust down me a brick (Skrrt)
Gave Metro a million, told him not to quit (Metro)
East Atlanta, Zone 6, Gucci really rich
Plus, they keep bud in the kitchen, fuck some eggs and grits
Jimmy Henchman with the shipment, I sold a lot of shit
Heard I killed a man allegedly, but I didn't bust a head
The way they mixin' up the medicine, I might just grow some dreads

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gotta keep them snipers wit' me, dawg
I got more enemies than 50, dawg (Huh?)
He popped a Percocet, he noddin' off (Wow)
On high alert, they just might pop it off (Shh)
11 o'clock, she popped an Adderall (Huh?)
That bitch so bougie, yeah she bad and all (Muah)
That bitch so thick, you know she lit and all
It's Gucci Mane, you know it's bricks involved (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
The sun ain't even up yet, I'm thinkin' 'bout the check ('Bout it)
Woke up in the mornin', bust down me a brick
Gave Metro a million, told him not to quit
East Atlanta, Zone 6, Gucci really rich
Plus, they keep bud in the kitchen, fuck some eggs and grits
Jimmy Henchman with the shipment, I sold a lot of shit
Heard I killed a man allegedly, but I didn't bust a head
The way they mixin' up the medicine, I might just grow some dreads

[Outro]
When they don't understand the fight
I want you to tell them what you want them to do
Most of all save us
I know you can
Oh, I said...
Save the world
Save the world
Save the world
I would like for the horns to talk to you right now
