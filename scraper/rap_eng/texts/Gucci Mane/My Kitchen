It's ya boy Gucci
Another beat banger, Fatboi fucking with me

[Hook]
Put the pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, Gucci? Plenty working in the kitchen
Pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, how you get it? plenty working in the kitchen

[Verse 1]
Thirty thousand dollars for the So Icey Squad
Thousand pound deal for the So Icey Boys
Gucci Aquarius a So Icy shark
Selling white chalk tryna duck these narcs
Bought some Lowenharts and some D.U.B.'s
34 inch Ashanti's on the Humvee
Whole lot of purp, whole lot of green
Whole heap of white, large amount of beans
Got them collard greens, sell a lot of things
Four plus a four, dawg, that's a chicken wing
Trapping in a drought, money in the vault
Bring me another pot and another fo'
Gucci!

Gucci don't care, scale like yeah
Mojo's there, egg beaters there
RIP to Blockbeater, O.J. here (Juice)
Oh my God, it's Zone 6 year
Zone 6 chimps, Bouldercrest bear
Zone 6 rims, and Bouldercrest jills
30 inches got me looking down on him
And I'm so high, it's so lonely up here
Jumping out the vert, it's some bitches over there
Big booty bitches loves a good cooking player
Bricks in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Pounds in the closet, money in the attic
GUCCI!

But we ain't really lost cause we can Isotol dat ass
When we bringing route, bring it to your door
Money on the floor, bring money to the door
