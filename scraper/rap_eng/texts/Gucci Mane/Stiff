She dont fuck with broke niggas shes stiff
And I dont fuck with broke bitches im stiff
And I lowering my tricking im stiff
And you ain't gotta fuck with it im stiff
I only fuck with bad bitches im stiff
She only fuck with rich niggas shes stiff
Im talking good game give em so swift
I need a million dollar bitch cause im stiff

[verse1]
Im balling hard like im playing for the pistons
Im throwing money in the club you shuld've been gone
Super duper balling shit is what my wrist on
Looking for a super bad bitch to piss on
I chop em off so every verse is like diss song
Say she never seen a nigga throwing this on
He lil [?] to see his bitch gone
Im buying drinks for all my friends I insist on
Big watch like the flint stones
I bring fire and brick stones
Wearing bottles with my chick on
And getting money with my clique on
We screaming quaterback half a brick and that ain't a hit song

[hook]

[verse2]
I got to rest a long way and they stiff
So she could tell im getting money out for real
Dont mean mixtape but I got that pill
Pass  so much money I could close down phills
You niggas hold touches not how Im built
A hundred thousand young hoes like wilt
You tryna kill me you end up get killed
Nigga told me to stay strapped and not just slipped
Sixes on my scrape 8 big lips
My hat cocked back my brain on tip
I serve lean beams even serve MILFS
How the hell im gonna help you when you can't help yourself
