[Hook: Daytona Sticks]
I mean I love my ol' lady, my ol' lady love me
She be drivin' me crazy, no place that I'd rather be
She's a beast in the kitchen, she fix breakfast in bed
And there's no competition, she's the best with that head

[Verse 1: Daytona Sticks]
She keeps it real never stress me, she my nigga my bestie
She take a bullet for daddy, she my bulletproof vestie
She be home all the time, she ain't stuntin' them clubs
She tell them niggas she mines, she ain't stuntin' you scrubs
When I'm on my lil' grind, all them shows I be rockin'
My lady stay on my mind, even though them ho's jockin'
Everything down together, 'cause we always together
His and her's for each other, Fendi, Prada whatever (prada whatever)
Not your average, I got the baddest chick
Thick down to the floor, a real flashy chick
Pretty eyes, cute face, titties, ass, and shit
A lil' slim in the waist, a real classy chick
When them crackas search the place she get to stashin' shit
Ain't nobody said, ain't nobody askin' shit
Be all about her bread, currency and stack these chips
When niggas run up on me, she know to get to the clip

[Hook: Daytona Sticks]
That's why I love my ol' lady, my ol' lady love me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane & Daytona Sticks]
Heh, it's Gucci (Swizzop, yeah) Sticks we got one
(straight up, talk to them Gucci!)
I ain't thinkin' 'bout them bitches but they thinkin' of me
Richest nigga out the hood and they know I'm a G
Every king need a queen, so I got me queen
We one hell of a team, I'm the man of her dreams
Put a rock on her finger that control the weather
We don't go together, we grow old together
I was locked in the feds and she rolled for me
Kept my business intact like it supposed to be
Now I'm balling like a dog, we can fuck up the mall
Baby love my dirty drawers, I ain't perfect at all
Yeah I love my ol' lady I ain't scared to say it
Nigga play with me and mines I ain't scared to spray it, grraah!

[Hook: Daytona Sticks]

[Verse 2: Daytona Sticks]
She kept it real never play me, she my buggable daily
She been lovin' me crazy, kissin' and huggin' me baby
She been tellin' me lately, "Can a nigga replace me?"
And if it ever get crazy, she gon' fight bout her baby
But if the shit hit the fan, she gon' do what she can
She'll work two or three jobs just to do for her man
She can go without nails, she can go without lashes
She don't need all that makeup on and still be the baddest
You had to leave your friends alone because they just talk about me
Say I got all kind of ho's and I ain't thinkin' about you
Watchin' all my videos and say I'm fuckin' the models
But you know your nigga better, so your friend tryna holla
And the best be (ok), how she impress me? (Ok)
Yeah she got her own she ain't trying to finesse me (nope)
If I go to jail today she'll be the one (be the one)
And if I call home too she gon' press one (Hello?)

[Hook: Daytona Sticks]
That's why I love my ol' lady, my ol' lady love me
She be drivin me crazy, no place that I'd rather be
She's a beast in the kitchen, she fix breakfast in bed
And there's no competition, she's the best with that head
