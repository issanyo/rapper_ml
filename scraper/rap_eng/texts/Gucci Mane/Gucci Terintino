[Intro]
(Whew)
(Mike WiLL Made It)
Fuckin' mulianis (Gucci Mane)
Say hi to my lil friend
Fuckin' mulianis (Future)
Say hi to my lil friend
Fuckin' mulianis (DJ Scream)
Say hi to my lil friend (And this is a gift for the streets nigga)
Gucci Terintino in this mother fucker (We ain't gon charge y'all nothin)
Hah! (We gon put this shit on the block)
Gucci! (For free)
It's the last time! (DJ Scream, hood rich, bitch) [Free Bricks, nigga]

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
I get you fuckers knocked out for a quarter key
I told you mother fuckers not to fuck with me
Cocaine dancin' in my mansion, it's a homicide, Charles Manson
She nervous and she panicked (Hood rich)
So I vanished instead of vanquished
Call her dandruff, leavin' bloody trails in my Stan Smiths
Swear I killed the bitch like Columbine
Left the bitch dead, flatline
Only talked to you like ten times
Had a great lawyer who loved to shine
I heard it through the grapevine
Gucci Mane lives a life of crime

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
I brought her back like Frankenstein
All my goons like Frankenstein
Tryna go and I ain't a kid
And I don't ever die they like vampires
Bought a [?] with like ten times
And make the money back on the first try
Got more hands than an octopus
Got eight different kinds, it's octo-kush
You talkin' to them folks cause you needed protection
If your ass was lost I wouldn't even give you directions
She only sucked my dick cause she needed affection
How the fuck you let that bitch slip and come in my section?
She say that she a teacher, she teach first grade
So what? Still imma fuck her on the first date
Like a wine cellar, I'm gon keep some fine grapes
My swag sick, imma need some first aid
Cause I pull up in the old school with the candy
The parking lot gon need a fucking band-aid
Colder than a icicle, it's a Can-Am not a tricycle
It's a Harley, not a bicycle
My gang stronger than corn liquor
