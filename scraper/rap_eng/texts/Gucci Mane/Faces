Gucci mane - Faces ft. Young Scooter

[DJ Scream]
Scream!
Hood rich biatch!

[Gucci Mane]
Got 200k in my deal-o dont put shit on my ....
Got a young hoe, ten years older
Drop the dick like a bulldozer!
Got my older hoe, she's a real soldier
Put it over and never saw it
Ten bails of dough in a new Corola
And I let her go and she still going!
Blowing up and she real pourin
Slow motion, IÂ´m still toastin
Wrist glowin no discoin
But I'mma kick the shit like I feel going!
If you didn't know this, I'm gonna tell
I start commotion, don't need promotion
Got way more money than the average person
Hood bad bitch, buy shoes and purses
Brand new Bentley I'mma close the curtains
Pack came in so I'm back to work
Feel it to his girl he a lying dude
But the racks come in you can start the flirt
Singing money, but he missin the payments
Back to the basics I'm in the basement
Got a traphouse full with a weed of Jasons
Pockets so hard I had to call the station

[Hook]
Faces faces
I've seen so many places
Pocket full of dead white guys that's plenty faces
Faces faces
I love that white erases
Don't wanna see no new faces
Rubber bands on all my faces
Faces faces
I've been so many places
I've met so many women
Tryina skeet on all they faces
Faces faces
Pretty faces I love to paste it
Bad bitches I paint they faces
Getting face on a daily basis
Faces faces
These niggas they scared to face me
You know you pussys face it
Mask up my face like Jason
Faces faces
I dropped her out to places
The feds they keep on chasing
For the bread I'm a keep my faces

[Young Scooter]
I caught a case, had to change my face
They was on my trail, but I got away
Faces equal paper
Faces buy you cases
Favor for a favor
Faces equal blesses
Faces equal flexing
Faces stop the stressing
I say fuck the feds, and free ......
He gave me a blessin
A lot of niggas telling (salute!)
He didn't make the call, and I relate the missing, yeah!
Nigga I want it all, I'm talking faces
In every state I ball, in different places! (let's go!)
Don't you piss me off, you'll be faceless
With my back against the wall, all I still made it
Let's go!
