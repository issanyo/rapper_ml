[Intro: Gangsta Bolo]
Yeah man
There's a lot of miserable motherfuckers out here man (believe)
They want a nigga miserable with em man (ay)
But it ain't nothin' man, SYS baby to the death!
Believe it!

[Chorus: Gangsta Bolo]
Misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity

But misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity
But misery loves company

[Verse 1: Gangsta Bolo]
But why do it come to me so heavily
'Cause I'm self-conscious
And I feel these niggas ain't real but they try to play me
But I keep comin'
Fuck shit's been stated
See now I gotta charge them haters
But see I'm so creative
These niggas just went on my latest
'Cause see they simple
I'm high-tech
Remember I'ma die black
Raised in a hood, with walls, rats
Raised on Similac and I love gats
Last year was hard, but this year was lookin' worser
So I wrote this in rehearsal
And I went yeah money my son deserves it (still)
See it's hard outchea
With this murda murda society
My baby mama keep ridin' me
Talkin' bout she tired of hiding me?
'Cause ain't nobody gon hire me
'Cause I get high and sell this weed
And and I'm outta here tryna pull a scam
Anything over a hundred grand
Girl I just can't get jailed
Got too many niggas I take care of
All my niggas are some playaz
They might have bail
They probably just need some help
And I'ma be right there
Ain't gon neva eva eva eva turn my back
Matter of fact I got my click a lick
Take over this music shit

[Chorus: Gangsta Bolo]
Misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity

But misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity

But misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity

But misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity
But misery loves company

[Verse 2: 4Tre & Gangsta Bolo]
You gon expect me, like I'm [?]
When it's time to bankrupt
Y'all needn't make like a bum
Hopeless sleepin' in the sun
Feel this one like doozy
Y'all bad bitch can't confuse me
My trigger finger like a prostitute
'Cause it always some loosie
I'm innocent (like lightfoot)
But I serve dope (and I serve jams)
I serve holla (got a hater's brain, could I offer you a stain)
I'm off the chain dirty, damn yo bitch purty
She already know who I am, 'cause she meet my Mr. Squirty
I don't know nothin' but real, so if you fake I can sense it
Don't tolerate no fuck shit
I'm down into the ave bitch
Blessed child on my mama
But it seems y'all ain't heard
Well I'll make it understood nigga
Bless my word

[Bridge: ?]
Now how the hell can I love a ho
When I know I'm rebellious
And I know I'm fuckin' other hoes
And I know they gon' tell em, it's like (written!)
When this money cold and you're wearin' a sweater
All these miserable motherfuckers be just shakin' like feathers

[Chorus: Gangsta Bolo]
Misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity

But misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity

But misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity

But misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity
But misery loves company

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I'm twenty-two, gettin' paid
With no job and no trade
Time's hard, I might walk
Pimp hoes and sell yey
Frustkrated, dead broke
That white is gon' be some dead folks
Think I'm gon' be starving?
While these niggas out here eatin' ho?
Nigga please, ask 4Tre
I been wearing this same shit four days
Grindin' out this 4-way
Diving in our slow lake
Fridays be rollin'
But Wednesday's my slow day
Thursdays be hot
Cause DC be rolly
They came through my spot
My fault, hid the pot
My Glock cocked back
Now when I'm forced to shy
As I ran through the trail
Tired as a motherfucker sweatin' like hell
I thought about my younger brother, picked up the pace
I called up a jay
I hid in the basement until it was safe
I came out real late
Damn that was close, but I still got away
And I don't mean to boast, but I still fuck with weight

[Chorus: Gangsta Bolo]
Misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity

But misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity

But misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity

But misery loves company
These niggas out here hatin' on me
Don't want me to get no publicity
'Cause if I do that's my opportunity
But misery loves company

[Outro: Gangsta Bolo]
Yeah baby I got your boy 4Tre in the house
You got the biggin in this thang
You got my boy Cold Blood the don, you know
You got yo boy Gucci Mane
Politickin' in this thang
Shouts out to that boy HB
That boy Zaytoven
Murda on the track man, it's over with baby!
Misery loves company, baby!
