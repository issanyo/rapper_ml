[Intro]
See, when I had no money I still had sauce
(mhm)
See, if you ain't got sauce then, you lost (mhm)
But you also get lost in the sauce
(how can you get lost in the sauce?)
Bitch go'n get lost in the sauce, man
Know what I'm saying?
(I know what you're saying man)
I'm not lost making the sauce, dropping the sauce in the street, man
(right right right)
Know what I mean?

[Hook]
I feel like I'm Gucci Mane
Yo shit boy too icy boy
Yo bitch say she like me boy
She say she is a pisces

But I do not care
That bitch don't have natural hair
Go bounce that ass over there
I got me a goddess
She ridin my lap
She's rubbin my back
If you want you a dick
You can visit my lair
I'm chopping these bitches who do not compare
Wait, hol up
Yo she a pimp?
You get to buy, yo she limp
No she is not from this planet (true)
Yes, maybe I am from planet X
And nigga, that is chemical X (uh huh)
That I plant up in your ex (Wait hol' up!)
Ooo , ??
Please don't touch shit, you are on ?
Vote for that ?? shit
Just suck this dick for an hour
While I jump down on these problems
Tryna figure how to solve them
When they droppin down like autumn
Like ??
Told you motherfuckers here what I say
The police is the new triple K
My advice is
Jeweler, I am the ruler, no slick, break
Lyrical science, that wreck or

Fo sho she is the iciest, Yo she is the iciest
Yo she is the iciest, yo she is the iciest

[Hook]
I feel like I'm Gucci Mane
Yo shit boy too icy boy
Yo bitch say she like me boy
She say she is a pisces

'Cuz I'm blowin up like dynamite
Damn, this a good time to call Jimmy Walker
Tell him I'm in Florida fucking someone's daughter
Cuz my rhyme schemes is something like no other
Cuz I'm movin up like the Jeffersons
Not to mention that I do this shit very effortless
Even write rhymes when I write my chick messages
Like my girl tall like the models and actresses
Everywhere I go, man, these bitches show me love
