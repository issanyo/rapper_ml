Once the glocc go pop, your body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, fuck the cops
Gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Save yourself, we the niggas with them big triggers
Me and D, bringing the pain to you bitch niggas
Imma hit m with the chopper, man
The only thing that can save his home is an avlanch
I just make a phone call, one call, have all yo domes fall
38 with the long barol, all them tips hit yo head, crack, you bone naro
Niggas hating, but I'm still here
Won't hezitate to put a nigga in a wealchair
Or should I say a pie buss
I'm runnin deep on your street, with 9 gloccs
And they all got extended clips, pistol grip, pistol slip, you get pistol whipped
I make m take they clothes off, fuckin load the pistol, then shoot a nigga nose off
I'm in the hood, I never leave, bustin heads with Jody Breeze
I killa nigga on the spot, nigga
Fuck the body, cause I'm aimin for the top, nigga

[Verse 2: 4-Tre]
I'm hangin with them real killers, cop pillers and drug dealers
Goin fill your ass up with bullets from the Skriller
No questions asked, see, I'm goin blast you
Jack The Ripper, I'm a real nigga splitter
I specialise in sweepin up game with Breeze, nigga
Let my work sizzle, I let the dope cook up, nigga
Dropping is great, so this cake, I get it
Tryna be slick, I rob then shoot your face, my nigga
I'm blast your mother, for thinkin I ain't
Have your brain slide the wall, like some brand new paint
And ride off in some brand new wet, go check, you bet we ain't in nobody det
If you o me, Gucci or Jody, we goin collect
Signed yourself, we goin have your ass on the stretch
Dissrespect the flex, put them thangs right to your neck
Tex, AK palm, these ain't no death threats

[Verse 3: Jody Breeze]
I walk around without a bodyguard, cause you niggas is not as hard
As you say you was, if you was, you wouldn't have to have a bodyguard
45 in my belt, try me, hoe
They goin find your legs on land, but the rest of you, it goin float
Get pumped, I'm put the rest of you in the trunk
Don't mess with the pump, less you wanna get pumped
Make m have to go down, I ain't scared of a dump, nigga
Leave you in the forest, like your last name gump
Jody Breeze and Gucci Mane, pull up in the Gucci van
With 2 or 3 rooggers, that's what we shootin, man
Hold up, nigga
Bitch, show nough, nigga
When I'm shootin, I'm aimin from your throat up, nigga
Cause you haters bout to make me put my glocc in yo face
Show you pussys what it's really like to ride the wave
So lean back, nigga, I mean that
Nigga, I squeeze back, trigger, cause I'm back, nigga
The bumper same color as the Indiana pacer, man
Redgy getting old, so I'm stikin with the purple, man
I'm the young thug that go up and down in here
If you rich, nigga, let me see you sign yourself
