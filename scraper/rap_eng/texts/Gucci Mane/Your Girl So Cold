[Hook x2]
Your girl so cold, lil shawty like to powder nose
The cocaine keep her frozer than a polar bear's toes
Strap a brick to the bitch, then I tell the bitch go (go)
I fed that pussy cat now she will never go home

[Verse 1]
Your daughter is a snorter, but I treat her so good
I swear I never ever met a girl so hood
I live on Glenwood and I came in red Vette
She's a pretty red bone, but she sniffin that shit
Gotta give it to her cause she say she really need it
She water whip it for me and she suck a good dick
The state patrol borders on the county exit
So I slid that girl a forty, told her don't say shit
Now your daughter's in the county and the charges might stick
I got a great lawyer, he can get her out quick
They be swangin out the county, screamin "Let's get, get it"
Gave the girl a quarter chicken and she started back sniffin

[Verse 2]
Bro, the way the hoe go, she deseve a mink coat
The way she deep throat, she will never go broke
Looked her dead in the eye and told her baby lets talk (talk)
What you wanted like [?]
It's twenty-five birds in my local trap store (bur)
Its sixteen fever when I swing the back door
A cocaine cowgirl, she a trap girl Jones
Go girl, go girl, baby, bring it back home (go, go, go)
Phone call my homie, say that he know it works out
Bankin for a man, and she must wanna hit dough
Now this hoe must think Gucci Mane a goddamn joke
She came home, I choke-slammed her by a goddamn four

[Verse 3]
You are just another girl on a dope man dick (hah)
Bitch, I'm swaggin through the city with another bad bitch
Took the tint off the Benz, so your friends can look in
Pulled up to the park and see my ex girlfriend
She lookin like a fool, cause she can't get in
I cut the Benz off and turn my swag up, ten (Gucci)
Now I know that ain't the same outfit you been had
Never miss it till it's gone still it can't come back (Gucci)
