[HOOK]
Just got out of jail. Just went back in jail. (Burr!)
Just got out of jail. Just went back in jail. (Burr!)
Just got out of jail. Just went back in jail
I farted in the cell. They said “What's that smell?”
(Ugh)

[VERSE]
Gucci do the time ‘cause he do the crime
I'm sitting in the cell trying to past the time
Don't take too many baths but I smell fine
I spent too many nights in my cell crying
I get no visitation, I don't get no calls
I guess when I was tweeting, I pissed people off
I be in the cell doing jumping jacks
Tired of being fat, I want my six pack
Hip Hop Abs like i'm Shaun T
Make the inmates say “Ugh” like Master P
Gucci had to learn to make his own bed
Gucci tired of fighting over cornbread

[HOOK]

I remember they was hollering “Free Boosie”
I know everybody saying Free Gucci
I bought her ass shots, gave her free booty
When I get out its gone be a movie
Ugh!
