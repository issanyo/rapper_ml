[Gucci Mane]

It's Gucci!

Rack City bitch, Rack Rack City bitch
East Atlanta but we call it trap city bitch
Million dollars worth of ice on wild city bitch
And I’m not trying to brag but I’m nigga rich
And I’m laughing with the money like I’m silly bitch
Drink Ciroc all night like I’m Diddy bitch
Say Gucci, ain't the shit, you’re a idiot
Like a paralyzed man, I ain’t feeling it

[Tyga]

Rack City bitch, Rack Rack City bitch
Rack City bitch, Rack Rack City bitch
Rack City bitch, Rack Rack City bitch
Ten, ten, ten, twentys and the fiftys bitch
