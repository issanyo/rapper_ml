[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm livin' one helluvalife
Crazy colored karats, baby, cover your eyes
Front headlights and I'm smokin' on loud
One of those nights in my helluvalife
I brought a lot of ice so I shine like a star
You see me from afar, girl, you know who I'm are
A ghetto superstar in a helluva car
A ghetto superstar, it's a helluvalife

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Rozay not beer, toast
Baby, say cheers, major ice make ya go burr
Cake so big it's like, yeah
Swag so stupid, I'mma real time heir
A buncha street niggas gettin off no legal
See me on front street but now I'm on cable, able
And it's human nature to hata playa gettin' papa
Money like skyscrapa
It's Gucci

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm livin' one helluvalife
Crazy colored karats, baby, cover your eyes
Front headlights and I'm smokin' on loud
One of those nights in my helluvalife
I brought a lot of ice so I shine like a star
You see me from afar, girl, you know who I'm are
A ghetto superstar in a helluva car
I'm a ghetto superstar, it's a helluvalife

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
Went to sleep in Michigan, woke up in Miami
(Where?)
South Beach sleep with a bitch in my pajamas
On the most expensive liquor front the most expensive fos
Smoke the most expensive dro, rock the most expensive clothes
Cars that we ride ain't out this year
I got diamonds on my pinky, on my wrist and on my ear
Baby, I'm a chandelier, standin' at the bar
Like an ice cold beer, we outta here
It's been a helluva night

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm livin' one helluvalife
Crazy colored karats, baby, cover your eyes
Front headlights and I'm smokin' alaf
One of those nights in my helluvalife
I brought a lot of ice so I shine like a star
You see me from afar, girl, you know who I'm are
A ghetto superstar in a helluva car
A ghetto superstar, it's a helluvalife

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
Michael Jackson diamonds, VVS colors
Pull up to the club in a '08 Mustard
Bustin' fifty bricks, dog use a little muscle
Young juice man, goddamn I'm a hustla
Ghetto superstar and ma money's super double
Prada shoe walkin, the rap game in trouble
Six go cookin', so the Juice bunkin'
Young juice man, smokin' pounds of that funky

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm livin' one helluvalife
Crazy colored karats, baby, cover your eyes
Front headlights and I'm smokin' on loud
One of those nights in my helluvalife
I brought a lot of ice so I shine like a star
You see me from afar, girl, you know who I'm are
A ghetto superstar in a helluva car
A ghetto superstar, it's a helluvalife
