[Chorus]
It's Gucci, it's Gucci two times
It's Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times

[Verse 1]
I'm starting off the day with the paper, the paper
Me and Flockaveli nigga ballin is my major
70K tucked like I'm robbing, I'm robbing
BrickSquad bandanna in me Robins, me Robins
Me and YG Hootie, who dat? He from Compton that's Bompton
Half a onion bought it from the game room, that's Thompson
Ten 17 on my face and my necklace
Mob so deep we wish a nigga would disrespect us
Put me in the game, I might score a triple-double
Kush, purp, lean, awww man, they in trouble
Meet me at the Georgia Dome, standing on da 50
With 50 on my wristy wristy, 80 in my Dickies

[Chorus]
It's Gucci, it's Gucci two times
It's Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times

[Verse 2]
The paper, the paper, I'm 'bout that, 'bout that
Ferrari black and yellow, got one yellow black
Back to back in 'Rarris, who the fuck is that? (It's Gucci!)
The Brick Squad boss, anybody get it
I got so much money if I want the bitch
I go into my bag, everybody hit it
I'm at Club Onyx fuckin' with the strippers
I tip em, squeeze your nipples, squeeze your nipples
I got crazy choppers, crazy choppers
I send you to the doctor, to the doctor
All-black Phantom pull up the opera
Bad white bitch call her Cindy Lauper

[Chorus]
It's Gucci, it's Gucci two times
It's Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
