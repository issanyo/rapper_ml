[Hook: Young Thug]
Got a hundred bands in the back of the pickup
(Show me a hundred bands right now nigga)
Let’s ride bro, just in case he show up
(Let’s ride, that nigga might ball somethin')
Can’t trick me, nigga, got to show us
(Show me that weed, show me that weed)
Now I tricked you, nigga, this a stickup
(Turn around your pussy ass, get 'em!)
Got bands like a motherfucking project
Got bricks like a motherfucking project
Got bricks like a motherfucking project
Got bricks like a motherfucking project
Like a project
Like a project
Got bricks like a motherfucking project
Got more bricks than a fucking project
More bricks, more bricks than a project

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
B R I C K S, we got those for sale
Retail! I ain’t sending no pictures, no details
Gone get it, get it gone
Just cause I’m home alone don’t mean I ain’t got chrome
I bang your dame, E.T. phone home
Some of these bricks are white
Some of these bricks are tan
Sixty percent are owned
Hundred percent get gone
That’s why I gotta keep chrome
No Ion wanna go home
Man I wish I had me a clone
Damn, damn, even though I’m on
The bitch can’t find her motherfucking home (brrrat)
Bottles, no babies... Baby bottle and baby...
Lean, lean, lean, got me feeling like I’m motherfucking pregnant
I love you baby
But I love my bros the most
2500, motherfuck 12
Yeah DK out on bail, kick it

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
In a duplex house
If I knew back then what I knew right now
I wouldn’t never moved out
Can’t take no loss, I don’t never lose out
Used to hide my straps at another dude’s house
Used to take my food out another nigga mouth
When you showed me the guap then the trigger come out
When you showed me the pot then the nigga come out
Heard yesterday that ten niggas got got
Heard last night that ten niggas got shot
In a bando, yeah, that’s a boarded up house
Commando, got a pistol on me now
I’m Rambo, got a chopper gun you down
El Loco, Jesus, Alejandro
Get ya head knocked off just like Chapo
Guwop will knock the meat out your taco
Robin cargos hold all this cargo
Too many bricks sold, so might need a barcode
Plug coming in from Trinidad, Tobago
Trap in a chokehold, dope by the boatload
Fuck a show, I’mma go gold with the dope bowl
You a bad bitch let me tell you what you don’t know
Let a rich nigga put it down in your ooh ooh
Got my dick in her mouth and a thumb in her asshole
And the trap got bread, like fuck with a Don, ho!
