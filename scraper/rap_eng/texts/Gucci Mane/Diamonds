[Intro - Gucci Mane & DJ Drama]
Gangsta grillz, pussy
Let me reiterate on that
How come, it’s always you haters that say you don’t wanna hear what I got to say?
I don’t hear your motherfuckin girls saying that
DJ Drama
It’s so cold outside!

[Hook]
Maxi pad diamonds on, redder than that bitch you have
Taxi cab diamonds on, yellow like my yellow Lamb’
Toni Braxton diamonds on, black and pretty shiny, baby
Miley Cyrus diamonds on, caucasian ‘cause I’m racist

Pacific Ocean diamonds on, blue like off the coast of Cali
Citrus colored carats on, like Juice Man I’m straight from Sun Valley
Shoulder lean necklace on, please don’t let Bon Jovi wear it
Money colored diamonds, same color as the cash I carry


[Verse 1]
One video 30 G’s I spent on my So Icey charm
Ball so fucking hot that I might set off the fire alarm
Bart Simpson on my neck — on the skateboard
Romo probably ride what the grimmer that I paid for it

I paid bout 80 G’s; white cat, yellow rock
Iced out Mighty Mouse
Can't forget the
30K in my jeans; I’m at 20 Grand

Timmy talk a mother fucker, 160 racks
I can do a lot of things, that cash—can’t get it back
2000 I still on my shine, I keep on copping these
Heart shades on ‘cause hood is in love with me



[Hook]
Maxi pad diamonds on, redder than that bitch you have
Taxi cab diamonds on, yellow like my yellow Lamb’
Toni Braxton diamonds on, black and pretty shiny, baby
Miley Cyrus diamonds on, caucasian ‘cause I’m racist

Pacific Ocean diamonds on, blue like off the coast of Cali
Citrus colored carats on, like Juice Man I’m straight from Sun Valley
Shoulder lean necklace on, please don’t let Bon Jovi wear it
Money colored diamonds, same color as the cash I carry

[Verse 2]
"If Gucci mane don't knock it off, I'mma cut his pockets off
I'mma cut his profits off, 'cause he just keeps showing off"
Egg beater chain on, black and white range match
Toe icy jack boys, Gucci bend down (???)

Rich boy white and yellow, bigger than a tennis racket
Gave my dentist fifty racks, this gold grill; you can have it back
White and blue bird on, damn it cost a nifty ticket
85, just bought a charm chain, extra sixty

White Bentley brand new watch (???) apricot
Yellow Bentley brand new watch same color of lemon drop
White Audemar, black Audemar, damn I also love my car
Say they call me Gucci, me and Walker got two Gucci new watches


[Hook]
Maxi pad diamonds on, redder than that bitch you have
Taxi cab diamonds on, yellow like my yellow Lamb’

[Verse 3]
All white since seventeen, Mariah Carey video, you seen
All red since seventeen, Yo Gotti video you mean
All yellow baking soda bought this (???) from Mario
Falcons hat for Falcons game Georgia Dome I hardly go

Old Jersey, red and yellow, you would think I was the coach
Red chain, white snow; it’s hard to feel me and my hoe
Red and white Mardi Gras; leather band, black Audemar
Green diamonds match my car; purple stone that match your heart

Damn Gucci Mane, ain’t fair; shorty say she fuck with me
All them niggas hate on you, 'cause Gucci they can be
Girl you got more smart than him, and you got more heart than him
If they put all their ice together, I’d still have way more ice than them
