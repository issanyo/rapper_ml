[Hook]
I can make two mil in a week
And I can get them pints for the cheap
And I can fuck your freak for the free
He think I robbed him but it wasn't me
I just took the doors off the Jeep
I can fit another whore in the suite
She gave me head and I gave that bitch a Jeep
She said I fucked her but I say it wasn't me

[Verse 1]
I'm fresh out the feds, I'm fresh out work-release
Got that strong and I think I'm Hercules
I'm the plug and I drop like once a week
I hit TZ and told him flood the streets
Me and BPM straight from BCT
Fuck that BT shit bitch re-up with me
And I see twenty-eight my motor eighty Gs
You wanna race me then let's bet a couple keys
I got this younger one, she suck me till I'm weak
Ain't fuck in three months and she still ain't missed a beat
Got this lil' young nigga and he think that talk is cheap
I'm on rotation on your feature, lose your seat

[Hook]
I can make two mil in a week
And I can get them pints for the cheap
And I can fuck your freak for the free
He think I robbed him but it wasn't me
I just took the doors of the Jeep
I can fit another whore in the suite
She gave me head and I gave that bitch a Jeep
She said I fucked her but I say it wasn't me

[Verse 2]
I can make five bricks off of three
And I can give your bitch something to see
At the Hawks game court side seats
I'm on Peachtree in the drop-top B
He want to be like me but Gucci too elite
Fuck them sucker niggas I don't want to speak
Orange Lamb', I pull up like trick-or-treat
I'm bag snatchin' like it's fucking Halloween
Master P [?]
I'm C-Murder I'm Pootang I'm Big Meech
This for my nigga that might never touch the streets
You never snitched then it's easier to sleep

[Hook]
I can make two mil in a week
And I can get them pints for the cheap
And I can fuck your freak for the free
He think I robbed him but it wasn't me
I just took the doors of the Jeep
I can fit another whore in the suite
She gave me head and I gave that bitch a Jeep
She said I fucked her but I say it wasn't me
