[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I rock Giuseppe slipper shoes got zippers
I'll f*** you out your money need a rubber for my pistol
My cheque so big I'll make your breasts get bigger
My neck so wet I'll make her nut more quicker
And like Scarface don't touch my sister [don't touch her]
She a bad b**** but she still my n****
Saran wrap city, basement full of big tickers
26s on my charger, Forgi's looking like [?]
Gucci coming up I'm bout to blow in one minute [yeah]
Showtime, bout to turn it up in one minute [BURR x2]
Brickman business cook a deuce in two minutes [SKURR x2]
Eggbeater Gucci cook a deuce in one minute [SKURR x2]
How many bad b****es fit in one Bentley?
She's f***ing me because she say you cum in one minute
She love me one minute then she hate me next minute
She bout to take her clothes off for me in one minute [Guwop]

[Hook]
Girl you 'gon be late for work today
I ain't trying to f*** up your business
Eight in the morning, still in it [still in it]
Let me get one more minute

Got a drop top Ferrari on skinnies [neeeoom]
Spent a half a million dollars one minute
Zone six a n**** lose his life in one minute
