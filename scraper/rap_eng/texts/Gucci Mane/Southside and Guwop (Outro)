[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Southside on the track, yeah
Gato
Gato
Huh,Huh
Go!

[Verse]
All the bricks mixed I'm focused
Take the whole load keep smoking
No IG stay focused
Dump 'em on the road keep rolling
Snitches got me moving slow motion
Thousand pints ain't no motion
Feds got a young nigga glowing
Get rich or die trying like Jody
My bankroll I can't fold it
Bank so big can't post it
Pull up in the club and we loaded (skrt)
It's robbers in the club and we noticed
It's killers in the club and they know it
Send bullets in the club and they know it
It's hitters in the club and I notice
It's envy in the club and it's showing
All the cash in I'm blowing
Different countries I'm touring
The messy bitch is so boring
Only thing I'm fucking is foreign
Got diamonds on my neck I'm litty
Pull up and go big on Diddy
So how you goin big on Biggie?
Young nigga selling kush like midget (Gato)
