[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
No, it's So Icey Slim and the nigga Gucci Mane
If I got a problem, then I'm calling Flocka Flame
Got a quarter brick [?], then I'm hitting up Juiceman
I'm twenty-one with the mind of an OG
Swagged up, make Rocko wanna do me
Pull up, got shawty in the dually truck, sexing
That's Gucci Mane car, so what, bitch? I'm flexing
Dodge Mag with the trunk on Bruce Lee
I know the streets, you ain't gotta introduce me
Heard y'all niggas gangsta and you're bucking on the pistol
So Icey is the army, nigga, buck on the missle
So Icey Twin Towers, yes, we dumping
Call him Flocka Robinson and I'm Slim Dunkin
Fab 5, we done made it
This a Mike WiLL beat and Slim done slayed it

Well, goddamn, Gucci cocky, then
But at the same time, young hoes be jocking Slim
Well, goddamn, Gucci cocky, then
But at the same time, young hoes be jocking Slim
Well, goddamn, Gucci cocky, then
But at the same time, young hoes be jocking Slim
Well, goddamn, Gucci cocky, then
But at the same time, young hoes be jocking Slim

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
Your hoe jocking me, but I'm jocking the cash
Oprah Winfrey, I don't like her, but I'm jocking her stash
'09, I can't fake it
If a nigga give it to me, then I'm gonna take it
Think I'm bluffing? Negro, please
Leave your eyes wired shut, you can die Chinese
I'll take my shirt off and the hoes start screaming
I'll fire one shot and make a nigga stop breathing
Full of jocking 'cause me and my nigga stunting
I'm in the club, putting on and you ain't doing nothing
Textbook gangstas, y'all niggas is loose leaf
The hottest rapper in the South, my boy Gucci
So Icey Sundays, catch me at Club Gucci
I ain't gonna finish this song until they free Gucci, nigga
