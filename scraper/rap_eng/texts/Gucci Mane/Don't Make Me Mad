[Verse]
Got a jamaican on me  now
Try me fuck nigga how
I will blam you and your partner
And the nigga thats with you now
Please don't make me, please don't make me
Knock your head off now [?]
Thats for the cash and I put your head in the trash
Nigga wanna double [?] me like pockets big gee
Send a Bricksquad chain like Frenchie
Rest in peace to my nigga Slim D he a G
Try me like Waka you a R.I.P
You a fool ain't cool, got the fire on me
God damn black major had to die on me
? soulja was my favorite MC
Hope the lean don't kill me like it did Pimp C
Run game like the streets we are not atheletes
I ain't no referee still ain't show cleats
God protect me cause my faith ain't weak
Keep a knife real sharp better erase my [?]
Got a knife on my K and it knocks out teeth
I'm a ex drug dealer not no MC
I'm a Sun Valley nigga that signed Chief Keef
Scooter get home in about two weeks
