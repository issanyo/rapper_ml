[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane and I'm a sugar daddy
Diamonds on so they lookin’ at me
She actin' like she don't fuck with me
But her booty cheeks keep winkin’ at me
Summertime, some am I
Pockets pokin' like a porcupine
Shawty standin' like a horse at night
Think I'm 'bout to buy a Porsche or nine
Gucci Mane out the fed joint
So married bitches want the voices now
Drop Rolls, laid back, Lambo, I got choices now
I put the crazy dick on your main chick
So now the girl hear voices now
Earring scream a hundred thou'
Bling-blaww I can't turn 'em down
Lookin’ like I drop work off
First off, I take my shirt off
Next off, I let the top down
Then me and baby girl skrrt off
Tellin’ Gucci Mane "I ain't it"
She seen Wop and she fainted
Gorgeous and she famous
Pretty face so I paint it (It’s Gucci)

[Chorus: OSBS]
Feelin' I been so Icy (brr), ain't no one gon' stop me now
Ooh, hit like Rocky, round for round, she feisty
Put on my chain, stop me, calling’ me papi
Ice like hockey, rice hibachi
Know I got him, but you got a carbon copy
Ooh, I know, I know, she needs, ooh
I know, I know, she needs, oh yeah

[Verse 2: OSBS]
So many bricks, had to Gucci my sweater
Pull up on Gucci, we Gucci wherever
She think its real, I know I can do better
Come to the face tryna keep it together
I know you down for whatever
That guy there done made you a savage
You built for whatever
Foreigns, my foot on the pedal
I'm good so I'm racin' the devil
That iced out my bezel
Shout out AG 'cause it made me a killer
I know the cops and the ops want the killers
South of LA we don't smoke Reggie Miller
[?] codeine I can barely remember
My niggas don't drop a dime or a nigga
You die, alright, they won't miss you
Pull up with clips, they hang out like they with you
Lost my day one, gotta tote through the pictures
I know when I broke your heart, you was dinner
I had to [?] through and [?]
Gucci bandana, I tied on a pistol
He just drip sauce when I kill him [?]
The tens ride around on the [?]

[Chorus: OSBS]
Feelin' I been so Icy (brr), ain't no one gon' stop me now
Ooh, hit like Rocky, round for round, she feisty
Put on my chain, stop me, calling' me papi
Ice like hockey, rice hibachi
Know I got him, but you got a carbon copy
Ooh, I know, I know, she needs, ooh
I know, I know, oh yeah
Feelin' I been so Icy (brr), ain't no one gon' stop me now
Ooh, hit like Rocky, round for round, she feisty
Put on my chain, stop me, calling' me papi
Ice like hockey, rice hibachi
Know I got him, but you got a carbon copy
Ooh, I know, I know, she needs, ooh
I know, I know, oh yeah
