[Intro]
Zaytoven
Ziggy
Burr, Gucci
Wop

[Chorus]
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww, blaww
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww

[Verse 1]
Man the bitch got fresh at the mouth so I iced her
She said something so slick I disliked her
If you ain't getting no cash like this, you can't pipe her
But if you rock a watch like this, it entice her
Man I can't even front on the chick cause she grinding
Necklace full of diamonds, wrist and fist blinding
The type of chick that Guwop like, you can't find
It's a clause in my young bitch contract you can't sign
Her closet like Rodeo got all type of designers
And every time she leave up out the house, niggas remind her
That she the baddest bitch in the world, and they want her
But she just a material girl just like Madonna

[Chorus]
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww, blaww
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww

[Verse 2]
Chilling in the pent playing jazz, she got jazzy
She's a pretty lil bitch, but her mouth is too nasty
The way she do the trick with her tongue, the bitch had me
She's a spoiled girl, rotten, so bad, I play daddy
See I'm the type of rich, that I give before you ask me
I got the type of dick make a rich girl start harassing
I started in the trap, then I switched and started rapping
She started drinking shots of Patron and started laughing
Ciroc and passion fruit now she sucking me with a passion
A fire breathing dragon, she riding me like a taxi
We started off as friends, and then we started smashing
Soon as she got a good dose of the macking she start bragging

[Chorus]
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww, blaww
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww
