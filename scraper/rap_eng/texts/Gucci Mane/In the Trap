[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane La Flare why you hard like that
Gator belt, gator shoes, where you shop at
Extra grams, like I'm cookin' up the dope with a extra hand
Yo gotti, money moe and Gucci Mane
Gonna mean two thangs
Worth two mill if the jewelry appraised
I'm with the money moe so you know its scrapin'
They call me baker man cause I cook the pies up
Skrt skrt skrt bout to scrape the sauce up
I already got the money, want the power
I got 10 G's, he make ten a hour
Double up, lil shawty, double up
When you shoppin' with us, you best bet to double up
Bought a half yesterday now you want the whole thang
I'ma flush my wrist out when I'm in the dope game

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Baking soda mix it with water
12 hit the door flush it down the toilet
All of us trapaholics
They knock us out,  back to ballin'
Baking soda baking soda mix it with water
All of us trapaholics
12 hit the door flush it down the toilet
All of us trapaholics


[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
This yo boy yo gotti know what I'm talking bout
Whole thang in the drought know what I'm talkin bout
Whip it up stretch it out thats what I'm 'bout
And if you wait too late I might be sold out
Jump in the s550 straight roll out
And if the money ain't right I'ma hold out
Cause I be hustlin', straight drug smugglin'
Interstate hustle they know whats happening
And I ain't servin' after 10 cause I'm all in
Cop a bird for the twenty nigga all ten
Deuce fours on the chevy got it crawlin
Hit the mall do it big, straight ballin'
Got a job, fuck it nigga call in
Get some hard be you'll own boss then
Cause I be shining, white and yellow diamonds
More money more bitches more crime then

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Baking soda mix it with water
12 hit the door flush it down the toilet
All of us trapaholics
They kick us out, back to ballin'
Baking soda baking soda mix it with water
All of us trapaholics
12 hit the door flush it down the toilet
Baking soda baking soda mix it with water
12 hit the door flush it down the toilet
All of us trapaholics
