[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Burr

[Chorus: Jeremih]
2-2, beat it up
Drop top, kit it up
Bang, bang, get it up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Loaded, I'm booted up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Talk talk, seal it up
Niggas ain't get enough
2-2, beat it up
Drop top, kit it up
Bang, bang, get it up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Loaded, I'm booted up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Yeah
Niggas ain't get enough

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Drop top, swerving it, ayy
This might hurt a bit, yeah
Bullshit, curving it, yeah
CÃ©line, heard of it? yeah
YSL, heard of it? yeah
Score mode, speed it up, yeah
Gas tank, fill it up, yeah
Big bank, split it up, yeah
Been a G, you're a finna be
Sippin' heem, not Hennessy
No respect, you're offending me
No Limit like Master P
You a big fish in a pond, I'm the greatest shark in the sea
In the Bay still yelling, "Yee!"
Top off like Kennedy
40 bands for the fur, chinchilla texture
VVS on me, seven rings like Kerr
And I want yo girl, yeah I just want her
Young Gerald so cold, made Gucci say "burr" (Gucci!)
Last night was blur, my drugs on pair
I be off that stuff so my words might slur
Veryon go skrrt, yeah
The engine purr, call it Black Panther
Murder, murder, mur-der
I'm in new Supreme, got a ruthless team tryna do something
Off a xan, have a lucid dream
Now I'm losing steam
Gerald

[Chorus: Jeremih]
2-2, beat it up
Drop top, kit it up
Bang, bang, get it up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Loaded, I'm booted up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Talk talk, seal it up
Niggas ain't get enough
2-2, beat it up
Drop top, kit it up
Bang, bang, get it up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Loaded, I'm booted up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Yeah
Niggas ain't get enough

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Can't keep up, car too fast, eat my dust
He too trash, he couldn't last, he wouldn't bust
Got a big ol' [?] and my bitch too bad and my ring on [?]
[?]
[?] G-Eazy, please take it easy, big booty breezy
Bought a Rollie in Sweden, gave it to my right hand man
[?]
Yeah, the haters be schemin', but I keep blingin'
Keep [?]
Touch down in England, treat me like a Springsteen
Never would have thought I was a kingpin
Bought a hard top Wraith and a drop top Don
That new SV, parked on the lawn
Drip head to toe, fit from Milan
You see me now and now I'm gone

[Chorus: Jeremih & Gucci Mane]
2-2, beat it up (Wop)
Drop top, kit it up
Bang, bang, get it up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Loaded, I'm booted up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Talk talk, seal it up
Niggas ain't get enough
2-2, beat it up
Drop top, kit it up
Bang, bang, get it up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Loaded, I'm booted up
Bad bitch, tooted up
Yeah
Niggas ain't get enough
