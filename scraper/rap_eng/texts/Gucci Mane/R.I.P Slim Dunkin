[Intro]
This for my nigga Dunk, he gone
The squad really miss you! Aha!
What's up, Slim?

[Hook]
This for my nigga Dunk, he gone, I really miss you
When you died, man, a part of me died, too!
This for my nigga for you know, I really miss you!
You're locked up; I'm feeling like I'm doing time too!
It's for my momma, mom, you know I wanna kiss you
And every time I go to jail, she doing time, too (damn!)
This for my nigga, for you know, I really miss you
And every time you're doing time, I'm doing time too!
Aha, time too, time too
Time too, time too
Gucci Mane, time too, time too
Time too, time too
Time too, time too
And I tell that, play up, time too, time too!

[Verse]
After the rumor on the internet that Gucci locked up
Everybody getting heavy, wanna see me fucked up
Soon as I touched down, my man got locked up
Gucci back on the ground and his money back up
When I pull up to the club, gotta bring a brinks truck
Yeah, you're getting good money, but not balling like us
You can even see my Rolly, all these fifty pints up
Make them bite that bitch town just to fix it back up
Man, I miss my nigga Dunk so much, I'd dig his ass up
If I could bring his ass back, I would dig his ass up
We would really go to sleep, we were balling so much
BSM and 1017, third game, we stand up
Remember Flocka was my goon, now he ran his mills up
I feel like [?] and pop my real brothers  them my big bros
I feel like... brought those them my lil bros
I can't forget .. closer, cause they can't be real, bro!

[Hook]
