Gucci Mane - Alot Lyrics
Verse 1
My time piece custom, tennis shoes custom, 90 bricks just past customs, i ain't even touched'em, may not even bust'em, any rapper challenge me verbal race dust'em, I guess you not accustom, you got on a cos-tume, acting like a ba-boon, slap u with a bar stool, like 4 set rush him, everybody jumped him, gucci mane so bossed up don't make me get to hush him, god can only judge me, lord can only judge him, he don't have a pulse so guess somebody stuck him, gucci got a fly mouth, somebody punch em, last nigga tried dat head look like a pumpkin, i don't give a fuck if u fucks don't give a fuck

Chorus
How many cars do u got (alot) how many times have u popped ya Glock (alot) how many times have u cruised da block (alot) how many haters do u think i got (alot) how many times am i talked about (alot) how much money do u think i got (alot) how many more men might get shot (alot) how many more men might get shot (alot)
