[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
One time cause I'm Shining
Two times for these diamonds
Three times for that threesome
Sneakers fresher than Easter
Shorty wet, like Katrina, I got sacks like a lineman
If your girl choke, on the dick I give your bitch the Heimlich
My music up and my window down
Smoking loud, while I'm sitting down
Stand up start smoking loud
My dually truck is black and proud
Crack the roof, and she crack a smile
I fucked the game and had a child
I'm getting money, I'm about to bring that back to style

[Verse 2: Stuey Rock]
You know we're getting paper (that cash) salute
Shoutout to the haters (hi haters)
Lenox mall shopping, shoutout to my nigga J-Nicks cause he the one got me popping
Wait, that me, that me (them hoes) that me, that me
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up, bottles to the V.I.P
I'm FDU, that means I'm Fresher Den You
I rep St. Louis, nigga, and Atlanta too

[Chorus: Stuey Rock]
I just want to ride, roll up and get high
We balling, ballin', ballin'
Got my niggas on the side
And we gon buy the mall out
And we gon bring them cars out
And we gon keep on shining
Rapping till the stars out
We shining!
That money, money, money, money
That money, money, money, money
That money, money, money, money
That money, money, money, money

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Money machine Gotti
White on white Maserati
My top on the milk carton, it's gone
And all I get is money, money, money, money
Me and Stuey rocking Louis poppin' bottles of Rozay
I'ma North Memphis nigga, Penthouse in the A
C.M.G, K-O-M
Million off a mixtape
Doing the rubber band dance
100 in my hand
I look, I feel like money
Niggas know I ain't playin', psshh

[Chorus: Stuey Rock]
I just want to ride, roll up and get high
We balling, ballin', ballin'
Got my niggas on the side
And we gon buy the mall out
And we gon bring them cars out
And we gon keep on shining
Rapping till the stars out
We shining!
That money, money, money, money

[Verse 4: Future]
Freebandz
I heard you hating on me (hah)
Ain't gon even say nothing
I'ma take your bitch from you
Put them Jimmy Choos on her (designer)
I know you couldn't afford them
VVS shinin' like Florda, blue water
I'ma astronaut, what the fuck you think?
Riding in the spaceship blowing on dank
I'm everything you know you ain't
Your girl want me, what the fuck you think? (check)
My lingo extra turnt up, you better get your check up, straight up

[Verse 5: Gucci Mane]
Big Gucci, and you know I like to shine a lot
So standing close to me you'll need some sunblock
It gets really lonely when you're at the top
You haters look so small from the view, from the top
VVS's see through diamonds, so they're transparent (BURR!)
I'm all about them grands, like a grandparent
Gucci I'm the treasurer, embezzler
Two diamonds on my motherfucking Bezzler

[Outro]
(We shining!)
(That money, money, money, money)
(That money, money, money, money)
