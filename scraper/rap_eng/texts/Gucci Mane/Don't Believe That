(Verse 1)

I gotta homie named Frankie last name Mueller and he hang with my panky ice cooler
And my role you should thank me thank my jeweler cuz he got me so icy
If another hater try to take my jewelry ima probably have to go and pick a jury
I'm goin m6 karots can you hear me I'm so flashy suckas can't stand near me
When I be a grand dad I tell my grand children when I was 30 years old I had 30 million
Came a long way from trappin in a vacant building 60,000 people screaming such a great feelin

(Chorus)

Think he all that he think he all that he think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack Gucci can't rap Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin to get fat checks and all that you think you go harder but I don't believe that and you don't believe that
Know you from way back you don't believe that and I don't believe that we just don't believe that

(Verse 2)

It is not that easy you goin to have to try harder to decieve me
Before I ever started gettin rap money I was wrappin up them things like a mummy
Your whole crew like food for my tummy and I'm hungry right now so its ovey
I'm tha hood MVP with a trophy I got 5 rings on like I'm Kobe
I'm puttin it down like my good partner Toby
He in tha feds yeah them people gave him 40
I'm still ridin around tha city with the .40
I think what the fuck I wanna think just run up on me

(Chorus)

Think he all that he think he all that he think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack Gucci can't rap Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin to get fat checks and all that you think you go harder but I don't believe that and you don't believe that
Know you from way back you don't believe that and I don't believe that we just don't believe that

(Verse 3)

I just got a text message should I say a sex message
Say she got an ice fetish told her get her mouth ready
Hydro got my light headed lambo got her sight seeing
Not tha average human being so im ridin in european
Paid em and I bring em in start out friends and end up fuckin
Please dont ask her once again they at my hotel going in
Gucci Mane be going in fuck your throat go again
DJ hit my ho again tell me what you recommend
I put it down I fly em in fly em out then go again
I get around like 2Pac 94' but its 2010
17 brick squad records I'ma busy man
Stay out Gucci buisness this ain't where tha rings on Gucci hands

(Chorus)

Think he all that he think he all that he think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack Gucci can't rap Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin to get fat checks and all that you think you go harder but I don't believe that and you don't believe that
Know you from way back you don't believe that and I don't believe that we just don't believe that
