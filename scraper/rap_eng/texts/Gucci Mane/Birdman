In the East Atlanta I'm Birdman
In the East Atlanta I'm Birdman
In the East Atlanta I'm Birdman
Ain't got money like Birdman but in the East Atlanta i'm Birdman
Birdman(2x)
Ain't got money like Birdman but in the East Atlanta i'm Birdman

[Verse 1]
I keep a stupid bank roll yeah a big bank roll
And I keep going to the club to see these same hoes
And I can't kick with a nigga that got no twitter nigga
You showing bags on Instagram, you's a stupid nigga
I got convictions and acquittals i'm a lucky ass nigga
I became a murder same year became a millionare nigga
And you can't tell me 'bout Sun Valley cause you ain't live in there nigga
And I refuse to be a bitch I don't need no nigga approval
And I was in chopper city
Balling too
BG nigga all on you
I got shooter's shooting i'll shoot some too
You know who fuck these nigga's in my crew
These young nigga's will hurt mane
Murkin nigga's with my work mane
Ain't got money like Birdman but in the East Atlanta i'm Birdman

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Pistol to your motherfucking head, you a dead man
Spraying every bed til' they put me in the feds, man
It's Gucci, and the crazy young nigga with the dreads man
And we smoke kush we stay high like Method Man and Redman
And these farmer's growing weed just like tomatoes and eggplants
Box cutter in my pocket, tryna open up ya chest man
If you live after these 50 shots, you a blessed man
I'm not a rapper I'm a ordinary nigga from the 'Crest, man
I got a extra ordinary cook game in the kitchen
You can diss me and put me in a awkward position
Green dot a nigga make him kill him in prison
Disrespect Brick Squad a very bad decision

[Hook]
