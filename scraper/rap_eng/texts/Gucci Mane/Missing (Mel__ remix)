Chorus:
Wife beater, yellow diamonds, lookin pretty
Your chick took a look, now she hooked shawty with it
Ferrari with the yellow forgiatos, Gucci trippin
I hit the button in my Scaglietti and get missing
Girlfriend missing, now you feel me?
458 paper tag it get missing, it get missing, it get missing
I hit the thrax pass it back, girl lets get missing

Verse:
??? filled the wrong prescription, im lifted, im gifted
The hood can't get enough they addicted
My pinky cost a 50 plus a 50, 50 at 100 quarter ticket
She miss me she wish she didn't get so damn addicted
Afflicted she don't wanna be a statistic
First round pick she a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Lookin at me lookin at her, damn she a draft pick
Elaborate, photographic, gots to have it
My Georgia dick'll have her happy, drizzy getting married
Riding through, zone six Atlanta in a carriage
White house, with white girls and they dancing nasty
Redbones two redbones and they tatted
Plug talking Spanish like Scarface and Manny
Ten birds ten whole thangs in the pantry
Just hit , just right she forgot the panties
ITS GUCCI.!!!!

Chorus:
Wife beater, yellow diamonds lookin pretty
Your chick took a look, now she hooked shawty with it
Ferrari with the yellow forgiatos, Gucci trippin
I hit the button in my Scaglietti and get missing
Girlfriend missing, now you feel me?
458 paper tag it get missing, it get missing, it get missing
I hit the thrax pass it back, girl lets get missing

Verse:
You think that im a sweet lick, boy you trippin
Thats a dummy mission, end up missin
Face on a milkcart do you feel me?
200 in the AR, bullets flippin

I ain't gotta talk, say a word they just blitzin

Stacks in my pocket everyone, that's a million
60 grand rubber band that's how i'm livin

Im stocked up on niggas its some denims on clearance
Gwapped up, get eighty and appearance, hate a pretty lady, she can get it
We can get a bite to eat, lets get missing, my Ferrari's a site to see, half a million
Freshest nigga you done seen, in a minute ???? everyday i handle business

Chorus:
Wife beater, yellow diamonds lookin pretty
Your chick took a look, now she hooked shawty with it
