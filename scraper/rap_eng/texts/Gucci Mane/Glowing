[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Diamonds on my neck be wetter than a jet ski
Shining like a brick, my fist glowing
Haters don't upset me, blowing
VVS, my neckpiece glowing
Diamonds on my neck be wetter than a jet ski
Shining like a brick, my fist glowing
These haters don't upset me, blowing
VVS's got my chest glowing

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Gucci gang like Lil Pump, ice jet ski
In love with money, man these bitches don't impress me
Yeah, I'm in designer, I'm on them drugs, that's the recipe
Fresh to death, RIP, Givenchy with a star like me
Zone 6, Candler Road, make a few
All black foreign with the caking seats
I got two lil niggas in the back
Ride with the chopper, the strap with me
Fuck the lil bitch now she at-ing me
We call the Adderalls addys
Rat in the hood, it flag me, yeah
Ball and I shoot like a Maverick, ooh
I don't wanna fuck, she average
All these karats turned me to a rabbit
I shine like a raw brick in the plastic
Got an AP, could've bought me a mansion
All my bitches they conceited like fancy
Hold up, [?] diamonds, can't you see how they dancing?
Geeked up like I'm Marilyn Manson
Going to hard, make 'em panic
1017, I know you can't stand this

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Diamonds on my neck be wetter than a jet ski
Shining like a brick, my fist glowing
Haters don't upset me, blowing
VVS, my neckpiece glowing
Diamonds on my neck be wetter than a jet ski
Shining like a brick, my fist glowing
These haters don't upset me, blowing
VVS's got my chest glowing

[Verse 2: Yung Mal]
Bad bitch on the jet ski, all these diamonds on me
So much money I feel like I'm flowing
I know a hater can't catch me, God finally blessed me
I gotta say my prayers in the morning
I came up on Candler but now I be touring
I stay with that hammer, young nigga be knowing
I got rich overnight, where I'm from that ain't normal
Fezzy made it so you know it be glowing
Expressway, do the dash in this foreign
Every day they tell a nigga keep going
Keep a pint of red 'cause every day I be pouring
These lil bitty boys ain't making no noise
Since The Wop came and got me
Old friends looking salty
But fuck it nigga, I'ma keep glowing
VVS's on my neckpiece
Boy your diamonds can't flex me
Pour that shit, come straight out the middle the mall

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Diamonds on my neck be wetter than a jet ski
Shining like a brick, my fist glowing
Haters don't upset me, blowing
VVS, my neckpiece glowing
Diamonds on my neck be wetter than a jet ski
Shining like a brick, my fist glowing
These haters don't upset me, blowing
VVS's got my chest glowing

[Verse 3: Lil Quill]
VV's in my neck be shining, off white bucket seat reclining
I might let the top back when it's snowing
He be talking cash, he lying, G5 jet when I be flying
Board at night, we should land in the morning
Remember they slept on me, I had 'em snoring
I been had a strap, a young nigga been armed
Served so many junkies, locked up in the dorm
I had the ho and didn't give her a coin
Rollie bust down, at night it's still glowing
When I get in town they putting me on
Cost fifteen thousand just for my charms
Got more in my trousers, I'm in a foreign
1017, I am an eskimo
We pour that lean, roll up that Texaco
You not with the team, can't come in my section bro
We finna go all they way up and we not coming out
We talk to that clean, we gon' come and get you folks
AR with the beam, it come with the telescope
I'm not on the scene, I'm all the way in Mexico
Finna pull up on the cartel, I'm tryna get more bread

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Diamonds on my neck be wetter than a jet ski
Shining like a brick, my fist glowing
Haters don't upset me, blowing
VVS, my neckpiece glowing
Diamonds on my neck be wetter than a jet ski
Shining like a brick, my fist glowing
These haters don't upset me, blowing
VVS's got my chest glowing
