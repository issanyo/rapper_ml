[Intro: ​iLoveMakonnen]
Winnin', I'm winnin', winnin'
I'm winnin', winnin', winnin'
I win, I'm winnin' again
So I'm spendin', I'm spendin', spendin'
I'm spendin', spendin', spendin'
I'm spendin', I'm spendin' again

[Chorus: ​iLoveMakonnen]
I'm spendin', I'm spendin', spendin'
I'm spendin', spendin', spendin', spendin'
I'm spendin', I'm spendin' again
I'm spendin', I'm spendin', spendin'
I'm spendin', spendin', spendin', spendin'
I'm spendin', I'm spendin' again

[Verse 1: ​iLoveMakonnen]
On that block, I'm like that hopscotch
Oh, shit, done fucked around and got pulled over by the cops (Yeah)
Nothin' in my car because I'm not sellin' weed
I'm out here hittin' the stores, I'm all into Fendi
Rodeo Drive, I'm so high 'cause I'm spendin' the money
Motherfuckin' big ballers tryin' to look at me funny
Like does he really have it?
Goddamn, is it a bad habit? (Oh)
You know I'm out here bouncin' around like Jack Rabbit
'Cause I'm winnin', I'm winnin', winnin'
I'm winnin', winnin'
Hit the block with my friends in Vegas
Know we sinnin', sinnin'
On the strip, I take a drip and take a trip
Back home, on my own
Bitch, I'm always in the zone
'Cause I'm (Ugh)

[Chorus: ​iLoveMakonnen & Gucci Mane]
I'm spendin', I'm spendin', spendin'
I'm spendin', spendin', spendin', spendin' (Ha)
I'm spendin', I'm spendin' again
I'm spendin', I'm spendin', spendin' (Makonnen, it's Gucci)
I'm spendin', spendin', spendin', spendin' (Yeah)
I'm spendin', I'm spendin' again (Go)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Once upon a time, a while ago (Huh?)
I was broke, Guwop had to kick a door (Pow, pow)
Now I rock with mink all on the floor (Burr)
I might put a Philippe mink on your ho (Mwah)
Respect my drip, money, designer head to toe (Gucci)
I'm the boss of drippin' sauce, so don't get lost (Ah)
They want a feature, but they can't afford the cost (Huh?)
My rate just doubled, 16 bars cost you a house (Wow)
I'm spendin' money like I'm printin' it in the house (Damn)
I'm the trap god, I'm the JAY-Z of the south (Huh?)
I'm the coldest nigga I done ever seen (Bling)
If you ask me, I'm the GOAT, but that just me (GOAT)
Fuck your opinion, my opinion, back to spendin' (Back to spendin')
If you ain't got it, why did you not go and get it? (Huh?)
This how I live, fuck friends, fuck opinions (Fuck 'em)
You make mistakes, you made friends, I make millions (Huh? Wop)

[Chorus: ​iLoveMakonnen]
I'm spendin', I'm spendin', spendin'
I'm spendin', spendin', spendin', spendin'
I'm spendin', I'm spendin' again
I'm spendin', I'm spendin', spendin'
I'm spendin', spendin', spendin', spendin'
I'm spendin', I'm spendin' again
