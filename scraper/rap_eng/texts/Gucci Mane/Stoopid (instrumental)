See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

Send on my jacky baby, call her terry bracelet baby
Bart one was spent 'bout 20 G, Gucci drop three eighty baby
Multicolor carrot tee, my necklaces are heavy mane
Hit the club then leave the club then come back with another chain

Mighty mouse is icy dog, Bart shit is just stupid
Yellow, blue, black, green and white, the diamonds match the groupies
Digitally enhance stones, pink is like a movie
Truly I'm a walkin' lick, Gucci man the talkin' brick

If you ain't gonna talk to chickens dog who you talkin' to?
7:30 in the kitchen, Nate, Nate about to go to school
Saturday I'm cookin' chickens, momma about to go to work
Sunday Gucci cookin' chickens, granny about to go to church

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

Heavy wrist activity got me livin' lovely
Cocka nina, heaven land, cocka nina shawty
Breakin' down ten chickens, dog about to cook the shake up
All these extra grams might as well go buy a Jacob

Gucci man for mayor, Gucci man so player
Repin' East Atlanta, that's ten minutes from Decatur
Almost match are cars and are belts going to match are gators
You can't swang like Gucci 'cause you don't got enough flavor

Heavy on the lickerish, industry ridiculous
Bitches I'm magnificent, I'm not very articulate

Gucci what's the penalty, shawty what's the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
Gucci what's the penalty, shawty what's the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid

My girlfriend say she love me but it's just the jewelry
Multicolor carrots got your girlfriend kinda curious
First I drop my verses and then I go and drop the chorus
Then I'm out the booth back to my trap, you know I'm mournin'

'74 restored it, Beethoven recorded
Say you charging 30 like that Gucci can't afford it
Gucci chargin' 40 dog, that's a couple birdies
Gucci stoopid jewelry dog, I don't think you herd me

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity
