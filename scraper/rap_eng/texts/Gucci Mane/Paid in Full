[Chorus: Lil Wop]
Woke up and I had a quarter million in my sleep, ay
First I bust a juug then I go get something to eat, ay
2k for me to talk, it’s 14k up in my teeth, ay
I’m a walking Draco, stick go everywhere with me, ay
Bought my bitch a purse cause she been mad at me for weeks, ay
She left her boyfriend cause that nigga was a cheapskate, ay
You ain't thugging in these streets so what I say, you cannot relate, ay
Straight up out the trenches, nigga came up in the PJs

[Verse 1: Lil Wop]
Carbon on the seat, ay, my niggas don’t beef, ay
Broad day pull up on your block, it’s a street sweep, ay
Shorty, i jumped off the porch, can’t leave, I’m in too deep, ay
Bitch bad as queen latifah, she was good now she a freak, ay
Before I go to sleep, cause I know cops look after me, ay
Lost some niggas in these streets and I'll be damned if that be me
Got some bluddas facing life and I just wish that they was free
I'ma do this shit for all my fallen, they a part of me (it’s Wop)
And forever I stay silent, naw, this fame ain't changing me
Everybody that was with me, yeah, still they remain with me
I don’t know, you wasn’t down bad with me, you can't hang with me, ay
Treat my gang just like family, they just like blood to me, ay

[Chorus: Lil Wop]
Woke up and I had a quarter million in my sleep, ay
First I bust a juug then I go get something to eat, ay
2k for me to talk, it’s 14k up in my teeth, ay
I’m a walking Draco, stick go everywhere with me, ay
Bought my bitch a purse cause she been mad at me for weeks, ay
She left her boyfriend cause that nigga was a cheapskate, ay
You ain't thugging in these streets so what I say, you cannot relate, ay
Straight up out the trenches, nigga came up in the PJs

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Niggas ain't seeing me, grind like there's three of me
Crush these niggas easily, my jeweler keep on freezing me
My young niggas bust five for me, menace to society
Gucci Mane keep making money, haters keep on dying, man
Big Guwop, Lil Wop, we hot, we trapping out the frying pan
Red [?], kids like they just seen the fire man
1017 C.E.O, 187, you're C.E.O
Pull up in a coupe you never seen before
And the doors open up like plane doors
Piped up, icing looking like I sell the white stuff
Bright chunks hanging out my fish like I'm your pastor
Gucci Mane, the lunatic, the old dirty bastard
Got Gucci Mane tatted on her tits, I never asked her

[Chorus: Lil Wop]
Woke up and I had a quarter million in my sleep, ay
First I bust a juug then I go get something to eat, ay
2k for me to talk, it’s 14k up in my teeth, ay
I’m a walking Draco, stick go everywhere with me, ay
Bought my bitch a purse cause she been mad at me for weeks, ay
She left her boyfriend cause that nigga was a cheapskate, ay
You ain't thugging in these streets so what I say, you cannot relate, ay
Straight up out the trenches, nigga came up in the PJs
