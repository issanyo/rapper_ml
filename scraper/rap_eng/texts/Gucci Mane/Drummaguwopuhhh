Before you jump in the game
Let's get one thing understood
If you're selling that ice cream
Then you got to make sure it's good
Mr. Ice Cream man, Mr. Ice Cream man
Mr. Ice Cream man, Mr. Ice Cream man

[Verse: Gucci Mane]
Yo my swag sick like the bird flu
And I'm going in like a curfew
[?] ice cream [?]
Got some ice cream, I can serve you
Tight jean cutie, nice little booty
[?] my nigga Lil Boosie
Million dollar chain, I'm Ice Cream Gucci
Pull it to the hood and the top just lose it
Before it came to pass I was selling grass
When the task force came I was mailing ?
Steal the stash cause it's here to pay
Lord knows I ain't trying to go to jail today
He might've stayed, and he might've ran
Got two flippers right now, white and tan
Maybe the man and I've got a thousand grams
And the shit go right with about a thousand lambs
It's over with, pack over with
Got a junkie in town with a sober bitch
I rock crazy ice, bipolar shit
I'm the coldest rapper and y'all noticed it
It's over with, pack over with
Got a junkie in town with a sober bitch
I rock crazy ice, bipolar shit
I'm the coldest rapper and y'all noticed it
