[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Born with it, born with it
Yellow bitch fat ass and she was born with it
Told her scrub my knee like I was born with it
And that pussy so good I nutted already

[Verse 1: Keyshia Dior]
She got that juicy booty, she got that wet, wet coochie
She got them double D tittes, you know her hair game crazy
She, she got that juicy booty, just call me juicy fruit
I put it in his mouth, just watch him chew it boo
Hush my shoes my jimmy true and my glasses too
I gotta shout out my white girls, they got fat asses too
Big, big ol ghetto booty, I know how to twerk it too
Big ol ghetto booty, make he spend that dope bread
And if he had a job, I take that nigga paycheck
And if ya bitch bad then I'mma take ya bitch from you
Ya nigga broke?, I got more money than ya nigga too
I got a juicy booty, and my pussy juicy too

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Born with it, born with it
Yellow bitch fat ass and she was born with it
Told her scrub my knee like I was born with it
And that pussy so good I nutted already
Born with it, born with it
She ride my dick, my knee like I was born with it
Keep them bands on me like I was born with it
Got 2 mill on me right now like born with it

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
20 chains on, I done made a entrance
Tryna rush the stage, should've brought a fence in
Said they seen a brick with muhfuckin' imprint
Man I ball so hard last night down there I had a injury
Smoking blunts of cookie in the Bentley
Cookie in the Bentley, cookie in the Bentley
Smoke, smoking blunts of cookie in the Bentley
Cookie in the Bentley, cookie in the Bentley

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Born with it, born with it
Yellow bitch fat ass and she was born with it
Told her scrub my knee like I was born with it
And that pussy so good I nutted already
Born with it, born with it
She ride my dick, my knee like I was born with it
Keep them bands on me like I was born with it
Got 2 mill on me right now like born with it

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Just look at my reign, diamonds in my chain
Me and Guwop pull up, fire flame
These rapper niggas lame
They never took the rest and took em on a plane
Blowing Mary Jane
I'm on a private jet, I just got a check
Riding round in a Rari, jumped off in a vet
Man the rap game hurting, heard that its a joke
Pull up in the U-Haul with 2,000 pints
Pouring up the lean, yeah I'm pouring up the 'gnac
Shout out to my young nigga, cause all we do is trap
Just me and Guwop, pulling up in that Jag
If you niggas get to talking, put the choppas on they ass

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Born with it, born with it
Yellow bitch fat ass and she was born with it
Told her scrub my knee like I was born with it
And that pussy so good I nutted already
Born with it, born with it
She ride my dick, my knee like I was born with it
Keep them bands on me like I was born with it
Got 2 mill on me right now like born with it
