Under arm kush so you know it smells musty
Sold a couple grams just to buy some red monkeys
16 on my Jacobs baby, ??????
Cut my bitch off, I went and got a better bitch
Yellow vet, red old school with the chrome wheels
Yellow rims on the vet, take a look at paul walls grills
I'ma start trippin' if I pop a couple X pills
Twenty thousand self promotion because I got no record deal
Ridin' round the town six 12s beat the block down
Zone 6 is my stomping ground, ???? valet don’t play around
Pitching cocaine like Greg Maddux on the mound
Your partner hit a five cause he shorted me a pound

[Chorus]
Under arm kush so you know it smell musty
Sold a couple ounces just to buy some red monkeys
‘74 old school sitted on Ashanti’s
??????, get my car washed by a junkie
Under arm kush so you know it smell musty
Sold a couple grams just to buy some red monkeys
Moved to Atlanta, sitted on Ashanti’s
Took it to the hood and got it washed by the zombies

????
With a big booty broad freaky with the dope clothes
Light green mid same colour as my shell toes
Made your girl my girl because she fronted me some elbows
Caught her with the ??? dog I'ma have to show them
??? with the muffler in case I have to blow them
Twenty six donk riding twenty six inches
Twenty six lawyers nigga, twenty six bitches
I give it to a nigga if I catch the nigga slippin'
Hit the east-side gotta ask for my permission

[Chorus]

I was in seventh grade with a half an ounce of ready made
Money rules everything the hard broke my wrist blades
J’s at my door, I got money on the floor
I’m a million dollar nigga on the motherfucking low
I be working twerk them powder pills, crack, and that syrup
I’m in my foreign car dog, it’s from western Europe
Thousand dollar ounce same price as my insurance
Shawty ??? my plates ??? trapping in a ???
Shawty talking to me man but I ain’t even hear her
Seen her dash last week and I ain’t even see her
I’m a fitted man, sitting man
Gucci what’s the dinner dog?
Shawty low told me “you is in the city dog”

[Chorus]

Cut my bitch off, I went and got a better bitch
Yellow Vette, red old school with the chrome wheels
Yellow rims on the Vette, same color Paul Wall grill
Imma start trippin if I pop a couple x pills
20 thousand self promotion cos I ain’t got no record deal
Ridin round the town 6 12s beat the block down
Zone 6 is my stomping ground, Sun Valley don’t play around
Pitching cocaine like Greg Maddox on the mound
Yo partner hit a foul cos he shorted me a pound

Under arm kush so you know it smell musty
Sold a couple ounces just to buy some red monkeys
‘74 old school sitted on Ashanti’s
Still rather get my car washed by a junkie
Under arm kush so you know it smell musty
Sold a couple grams just to buy some red monkeys
New ???, sat it on Ashanti’s
Took it to the hood and got it washed by the zombies.]

Mane I’m Arizona bound, is you down to take a No-Doz?
With a big booty broad I’m freaky with the door closed
Light green mid same colour as my shell toes
Made your girl my girl cos she fronted me some elbows
Caught her with the ??? dog I'ma have to show them
Back with the muffler in case I have to blow them
Twenty six donk riding twenty six inches
Twenty six lawyers nigga, twenty six bitches
I give it to a nigga if I catch the nigga slippin'
Hit the east-side gotta ask my permission

[Chorus]

I was in the seventh grade with a half an ounce of ready made
Money rules everything, the hard broke my razorblades
J’s at my door, I got money on the floor
I’m a million dollar nigga on the motherfucking low
I be workin, twerkin powder pills, crack, and that syrup
I’m in my foreign car dog, it’s from western Europe
Thousand dollar ounce same price as my insurance
Sheriffs? stopped my plane so they trappin interference
Shawty talking to me man but I ain’t even hear her
Seen her dance next week and I ain’t even see her??
I’m a fitted man, ??? man
Gucci what’s the deally dog?
Shawty Low told me “units in the city dog."
