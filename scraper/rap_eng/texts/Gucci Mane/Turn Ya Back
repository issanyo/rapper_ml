[Intro: Rick Ross]
You know, going through the things you go through
Make you who you are
But when the closest ones to you turn they back on you
It's such a painful feeling

[Hook 1: Rick Ross]
They turned they back, turned they back
But then 'em niggas wanna front
They blowin' stacks, they blowin' stacks
They turn they back, turn they back
But then 'em niggas wanna front
They blowin' stacks, they blowin' stacks
They turned they back, turned they back
Watch a nigga fall down
They turned they back, turned they back

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Turned they back, turned they back
I watch my nigga turn his back, turned they back
I watch my bitch turn her back, she turned her back
Watch a nigga fall down then she turned her back
But, now I'm back, now I'm back, now I'm back, now I'm back
Now I'm back, nigga, now I'm back
All my niggas turned they back, they turned they back
Even my people turned they back, they turned they back
Even my cousin turned they back, he turned his back
But now I'm back, now I'm back
Even my bitch, she turned her back, she turned her back
But now I'm back bitch, where you at? Now where you at?

[Hook 2: Rick Ross]
They turned they back, turned they back
Watch a nigga fall down, they turned they back
They turned they back, turned they back
But then 'em niggas wanna front
They blowin' stacks, they blowin' stacks
They turned they back, I asked 'em why
When they turned back, they couldn't see me cry
They turned they back, I asked 'em why
When they turned back, they couldn't see me cry

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Man, it's funny how a nigga act
Like he got shit bad, but really that is just a knack
You know a bitch that called police on you and took her back?
You stole a stack but bitch man, I would take the whole sack
"Say Gucci Mane, you the man, why you doin' that?"
He said "been workin' lockin' up that shit, it won't come back"
I told that nigga "man, there ain't no need to call me that"
When I was broke man these bitches wouldn't call me back
You could pay a nigga's rent, have a nigga back
Even pay a nigga bond what kind of shit is that?
I took the shirt off my back and put it on your back
Then you turned your back, oh what kind of shit is that?
Burr!

[Hook 2: Rick Ross]
They turned they back, turned they back
Watch a nigga fall down, they turned they back
They turned they back, turned they back
But then 'em niggas wanna front
They blowin' stacks, they blowin' stacks
They turned they back, I asked 'em why
When they turned back, they couldn't see me cry
They turned they back, I asked 'em why
When they turned back, they couldn't see me cry

[Verse 3: Whole Slab]
They triple crossed me, left me for dead
They blowin' racks, I'm fucked up, I owe these chicos bread
I'm in the red, I took a loss, had to crawl back
My own niggas crossed me out, now what you call that?
Fucked up my set, my bottom bitch, she turned her back
She want rum and rocky with me, she was chasin' sack
Pussy hoe, she turned her back, that's how she felt
Collect call from Rice Street, that bitch, she run herself
I knew a nigga 10 years, it's a deadly game
Man can win those cracker canes, shawty said my name
Shit ain't the same, there's somethin' missin'
There's somethin' different
Either ya ass get pimped or you're doin' the pimpin'
Slab!

[Hook 2: Rick Ross]
They turned they back, turned they back
Watch a nigga fall down, they turned they back
They turned they back, turned they back
But then 'em niggas wanna front
They blowin' stacks, they blowin' stacks
They turned they back, I asked 'em why
When they turned back, they couldn't see me cry
They turned they back, I asked 'em why
When they turned back, they couldn't see me cry

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
Okay, hoes turnin' back, niggas did too
I was sellin' crack, my niggas did too
Man I ain't see it comin', all the shit we been through
And they ain't see it comin' neither, last time I spinned through
Hard-top bent blue, every time I dipped through
Niggas turned they back on me, tried to fuck my bitch too
And I put 'em on paper, oh that's what this shit do?
Oh, that's how you nigga rock? I be wrong, I get you dropped
I get you wet, nigga turn ya back
Know where I live, I lay you flat, nigga, that's a fact
Put it on my kids, you niggas rats, and I'm comin' back
Look what you did, made me do that, got you niggas clapped
These pussy niggas...

[Hook 2: Rick Ross]
They turned they back, turned they back
Watch a nigga fall down, they turned they back
They turned they back, turned they back
But then 'em niggas wanna front
They blowin' stacks, they blowin' stacks
They turned they back, I asked 'em why
When they turned back, they couldn't see me cry
They turned they back, I asked 'em why
When they turned back, they couldn't see me cry
