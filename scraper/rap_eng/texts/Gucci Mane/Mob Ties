[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Steady Mobbin, steady robbing, you'll think we the Gotti boys
Hundred bricks of heroin nigga, you'll would think I'm Pauly boy
Way I'm bossed up on these fingers, you would think I'm Tony boy
Gucci Mane the money man, I'll treat you like an errand boy
You in the crowd and talking loud but who the fuck you scaring, boy?
I'm on probation, toting a strap cause I'm not even caring, boy
You bluffin' and I know it, I'm not buyin' the shit you sellin', boy
Youse a country monkey nigga, I'mma split ya watermelon boy
I got yellow ice and yellow bitches, rapping like I'm yelling boy
Fucking bitches while you snitching, yeah I'm smashing, why you telling boy?
He can't even focus cause this nigga really jealous, boy
A million dollars up they called my phone but I'm finessing, boy

[Hook: Gucci Hook]
The young nigga got mob ties
Talkin like a wise guy
But if you to it with my guys
I guarantee there's gon' be gun fire
The young nigga got mob ties
I'm talkin bout a wise guy
But if you to it with my guys
They're be some motherfuckin' gun fire

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Young nigga, mob ties
Got a gangsta bad bitch that's part of mob wives
Black strap, black niggas, in a black coupe
Mob shit, throwing my hood up out the roof
Round trip flight, come back and I flood the straights
I told my niggas say our grace because its time to eat
Negotiating and talkin numbers what I'm into
Nothing but extra strong on my menu
Place your order, then wait for it
Nigga come and get it, the best shit in the city
You say you want some P's, then lets go and talk business
I'll hit my nigga Gucci for you if you talking chickens
