I'm a heart breaker
Yeah!
This is Gucci
And I play to break your heart
Is just me not even you

[Hook:]
I'm cold hearted, (cold hearted)
They say I get it from my father (cold hearted)
I'm cold hearted (cold hearted)
More time I don't wanna be bothered (cold hearted)
No no, I've been some inner places chasing paper under the sun
Wanna start the family done I came but faithful to one
I got a problem, in the name like I don't feel for your fame
And I hate to see them tears on your face
But I can't erase all the memories we've made
Got my .. go crazy it's like I'm stuck in the mace
Don't lose your hope in me, but if you keep the faith
All you secrets is safe with me take the shit to the grave

[Hook:]
I'm cold hearted, (cold hearted)
They say I get it from my father (cold hearted)
I'm cold hearted (cold hearted)
More time I don't wanna be bothered (cold hearted)
No no, 'cause I'm a heart breaker (heart breaker)
I'm a heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
I'm drinking champagne of the bottle
I'm drinking they should spray like that's your bottle water
I'm drinking they suspend like that's your bottle water
I got the preacher's daughter doing all the shit I taught her
Go so hard I'ma break them hoes
Dick so hard I'ma break the ..
Cold hearted I ain't got no heart
Go mission I don't want no job
I ain't gonna help the time get hard
[?] she got no car
Push button I ain't got no key
Want to marry me and take hair my stash
Break her heart but the bitch ahead
I hate these hoes, but I love my fans
We have a doubt, but the shit won't last
Play the crash to where I drop my best
Head to head to where I made this cash
I ain't tryin' to give it up so fast
Blessed blessed now you win my past
Hundred Benz used to wipe my ass
Aces spade don't need no glass
Got rice of the past so the hoes go this
