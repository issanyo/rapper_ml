[Hook: Gucci Mane]
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm Gucci Mane the legend, I don't fuck with you peasants
I'm too heavy to be petty, boy is you balling or begging?
Please stop calling me, nigga, cause I can't spare not a second
I gives a fuck bout a record, I got a criminal record
These boys so scared of big Gucci, they make subliminal records
Most of these rappers is pussy, they making feminine records
It ain't a nigga in the industry that I wanna meet
Your favorite rapper a sucker that's not surprising to me
You can't be talking to the police then try signing with me
I ain't cosigning these niggas, I'm only vouching for me
I ain't letting these soft ass niggas stand on no couches with me
You niggas wasn't in no trap house stacking up ounces with me, pussy

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Who that at my door, that's Tadoe
Them folks ain't bring the pesos? My day blows
How I turn shit up, yeah the spiggas they blow
Sosa turn shit up, they say he tweaking, they know
Only time I chase is at the bank, ain't got time to chase hoes
NDC I need some poles, meet me at the Fuego's
I take 'em and box 'em up, these hoes I crate those
Ever since my niggas died I'm flexin you know I can't go
Poured up stuntin' I'm gon show out
I took your money it was a no show, ouch
You got the right money, I copped 'em standing on the couch
For these other niggas, no I cannot vouch
All this money, I'm a kangaroo, it's in my pouch
Bitches in my house, tell 'em hoes get out
Hop out, bow down, boy respect me now
You would think that I was Wop, how my wrists bling bow
These pistols sing like Beethoven, Beethoven
This pistol beat like Zaytoven, Zaytoven
What's up in my bank roll? Rainbows
Like Wop and Flash I hate hoes, I hate hoes
$2000 for my rain coat, my rain coat
I'm down for life like Fabo, like Fabo

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Pussy!
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Grrr
