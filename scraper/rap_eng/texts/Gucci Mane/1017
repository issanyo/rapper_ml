[Intro: Gucci Mane & Asian Doll]
(Yung Lan on the track, brr)
1017 (Brr, brr, brr)
Asian the doll, Wop!
Where you at? (Doll)
Gucci Mane, Asian (Brr)
(Hunnid bands for a kilo, nigga)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I pulled up in my 'Rari, it astonished her (It aâ€”, bitch)
I just wanna, I just wanna stunt on her (I just stunt, bitch)
I'm so hot that I broke the thermometer (I'm so hot, bitch)
My drip just overflowed, please call the janitor (Call the janitor, bitch)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Free my nigga, they gave him a calendar (Free the gang, bitch)
Sellin' gas so strong it's jumpin' out the Challenger
I'm the CEO, the artist, and the manager (Brr, brr, brr)
I'm so hot, I'm so hot, like a candle, bruh (Bitch)
Call your stylist every night, you need to cancel her (Daddy)
My whip the tip, the custom Hummer truck, I'm pullin' up
Dirty my name up, they dragged my shit all in the mud (Bitch, what the fuck?)
I'm tryna whip the dope and hold the pot, you hold a grudge
I gave myself a hug 'cause nobody would show me love (Hell no)
Ice on my ear, my wrist, my, is froze up (Bling blaow)
See I'm a Bouldercrest nigga, best sellin' boulders (Boulders)
55 semi'll knock your head straight off your shoulders

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I pulled up in my 'Rari, it astonished her (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I just wanna, I just wanna stunt on her (Mwah)
I'm so hot that I broke the thermometer (Ayy, ayy, ayy, woo)
My drip just overflowed, please call the janitor (Damn)
I pulled up in my 'Rari, it astonished her (Skrrt)
I just wanna, I just wanna stunt on her (Mwah)
I'm so hot that I broke the thermometer (Woo)
My drip just overflowed, please call the janitor

[Verse 2: Yung Mal]
ICE, the narcs just hit the spot, I'm throwin' babies over the banister
I get that pack, I run it back, I feel like Deuce McAllister
I got that sack, I upped the standards, niggas ain't in my caliber
I'm from Candler, young niggas hot like candles, shit, they light it up
Prices goin' up, just need my ice and double cup
Guwop told me get that fetty, fuck 'em, now I'm rich as fuck
Ridin' backseat, Bentley truck, Asian, roll that window up
Smokin' back to back to back, got me stuck, diamonds, yellow, yeah
Thumb through the cash like a propeller
Straight out the trap, I'm a real seller
Tried to go big, but he went bankrupt
Go hard, nigga don't ever give up
Yeah, skrrt, skrrt, pull up
1017 on my neck, got me lit up
Iceberg cold, froze, be lit up
Got my weight up, no sit up

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I pulled up in my 'Rari, it astonished her (Skrrt)
I just wanna, I just wanna stunt on her (Mwah)
I'm so hot that I broke the thermometer (Woo, bitch)
My drip just overflowed, please call the janitor (Janitor, bitch)
I pulled up in my 'Rari, it astonished her (Ayy, brrr, skrrt)
I just wanna, I just wanna stunt on her (Mwah)
I'm so hot that I broke the thermometer (Brr, woo)
My drip just overflowed, please call the janitor (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 3: Asian Doll]
I'm just lookin' in the mirror at a pretty young street bitch (Asian Doll)
AK-47, left that nigga on the concrete
You better come correct, I'm acin' bitches on the front street
Icin' out my hoes, 'cause it get cold, Eskimo season
Gold tags, fuckin' a bag
Diamonds, they eatin', you sayin' you fat
Shot-shot call, hundred K in cash
I'm coolin' these niggas, I'm mean like a cat
Big hands, count up the M's
Fuck that, baby, just fucked my friends
Say she wants it, all my drip, my swag, my flow, my way, my shoes
I'm so hot, hot, all these bands they drop, drop
Don't shop in no Zara, got the chopper dancin', pop lock
Smokin' golden moonrocks, pop out with my rasta
Racks on me, they tie-dye, that nigga wanna fuck, like nada (Bitch, bitch)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I pulled up in my 'Rari, it astonished her (Skrrt)
I just wanna, I just wanna stunt on her (Mwah)
I'm so hot that I broke the thermometer (Woo)
My drip just overflowed, please call the janitor (Damn)
I pulled up in my 'Rari, it astonished her (Skrrt)
I just wanna, I just wanna stunt on her (Mwah)
I'm so hot that I broke the thermometer (Woo)
My drip just overflowed, please call the janitor (Damn)
