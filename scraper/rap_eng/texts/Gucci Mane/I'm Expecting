[Hook]
I'm expectin', like your girl when she's pregnant
What you expect?
I expect another check in
I'm expectin' to pass out these inspections
Ice, hoes, cars... I got it all, you guessed it
I'm expectin'
What you expectin'?
To ride past you, 'cause you're just a pedestrian
I'm expectin'
What you expectin'?
To ride past you, 'cause you're just a pedestrian
[/Chorus]

[Verse One: Gucci Mane]
I'm gonna [?] mid-grade out the [?]
Boy, I stay sharp like a job
I'm rollin' joints
Me and my mob, Bricksquad
Yeah, that's the name
You know the game, what I claim
Me, Juice, French, Wooh, Flocka Flame
I expect to be the best
Bitch, we the 'crest
I'm so hood, it ain't no good
I need to rest
Me and Zay', a cryin' shame
We ain't got too much time to laugh
We countin' cash, I'm stackin' change
Our new lyrics, you wanna hear it
Suggest you listen, pay attention to what I'm spittin'
See how I glisten?
Ice on my wrist. Ice on my fist
Ice on my neck. Ice on my Timb's
Ice on my rims. What you expect?

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Juvenile]
You know That 'Nolia Boy keep it movin'
If you ain't 'about your money, what you doin'?
What you doin'? What you doin'?
Keep it movin'. Keep it- keep it movin'
Juven-ILL
Ice in my grill
I'm on that kill'
And, I will
...show you what's real
So, what's the deal?
Better chill
Get you a beer
Pop you a pill
How it feel?
When I pass you up
...and you see the wheel?
I don't see you niggas anyway
So, I'm pressin' the gas
Got [?] by my Bitch
'Cause I'm 'bout to [?] ass
Yeah
And, me and Gucci gettin' cash
We got shit happening [?]
...but, y'all stuck on [?]
