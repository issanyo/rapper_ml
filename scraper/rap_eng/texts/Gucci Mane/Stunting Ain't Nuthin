[Intro: Slim Jxmmi & Young Dolph]
Yah, ya dig? (Yeah)
Uncle Jim (Dolph!)
Ayy (It's just a whole lot of money)

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Nigga please, you ain't got as much guap as me
You don't wanna go dollar for dollar
You don't wanna go bottle for bottle
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
'Cause all I ever fuck with is models (yeah)
I'm a motherfucking player, my nigga (player)
If she bad, I'ma slay her my nigga, yeah
Stunting ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Pimping ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Balling ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Popping bottles, that ain't nothing to me (ain't nothin')
Driving foreign cars ain't nothin' to me
That ain't nothin' to me (I'm stunting, yeah)
Stunting ain't nothin' to me
Look at this shit, it ain't nothin' to me (ayy)

[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
You don't even know what I'ma do
When I'm in the zoo looking at the zebras (ayy)
All these hoes, they some fucking cheetahs (ayy)
Uh-huh, they some fucking cheetahs (ayy)
Throwed off, nigga on the reefah
I've been drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking (henny)
Hennesy going all through my system
Don't let your bitch be a victim
These niggas looking sad (ayy)
I'm running round with bags (rich nigga)
I'm into popping tags (what)
I ainâ€™t even got your brand (brand)
Money talk for me
I'ma do the money walk down the street
I'ma do the money walk down Hollywood
Leave my name on Hollywood, nigga (Uncle Jxmmi)
Your pockets looking brittle (what)
You a rat, Stuart Little (get away from me)
Ten thousand dollar outfit
She can tell I'm a rich nigga (bow)
Came out my momma like a boss
Got these hoes singing Diana Ross (huh)
Making big moves constantly
EA need to sponsor me (2K)
Swagged up, can't take it off of me
EarDrummers, we a damn monopoly
I remember I ain't have a pot to pee
Nowadays I'm everywhere the guala be (yea)
When I follow bitch you gotta swallow me (swallow)
I ain't tricking bitch, it ain't Halloween (nah)
We can't kick it bitch ain't no soccer team
I don't wanna talk, I ain't Socrates

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Nigga please, you ain't got as much guap as me
You don't wanna go dollar for dollar
You don't wanna go bottle for bottle
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
'Cause all I ever fuck with is models (yeah)
I'm a motherfucking player, my nigga (player)
If she bad, I'ma slay her my nigga, yeah
Stunting ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Pimping ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Balling ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Popping bottles, that ain't nothing to me (ain't nothin')
Driving foreign cars ain't nothin' to me
That ain't nothin' to me (I'm stunting, yeah)
Stunting ain't nothin' to me
Look at this shit, it ain't nothin' to me (ayy)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
(Huh) Stuntin' ain't really nothing
I walk like a jack in a box, I hop out the drop
Don't leave it to Beaver, just leave it to me
Gucci Mane making two million a week
Gucci earrings two hundred a pop
I cop when I shop, I don't know how to lease
Running like I don't even know how to sleep
(Know how to sleep, know how to sleep)
You remind me of my Bentley GT
On Magic on Monday, I throw up the money
I'm a man crush every day of the week
I'ma ball hard like it's Super Bowl Sunday
A fool with the chewing, she chewing the D
What in the hell is she doing to me?
SWV got me weak in the knees
Give her the trophy, the throat of the week
Gucci the GOAT, got my foot on a throat
And my feet on the wood like I play in the league
Criss-crossing the country like crossing the skreet
And I feel like the Pope, all these crosses on me
If you still selling dope then I'm giving you hope
'Cause ain't none of them getting more money than me
I'ma keep giving them something to see
Honestly, none of them fucking with me
(It's Gucci!)

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Nigga please, you ain't got as much guap as me
You don't wanna go dollar for dollar
You don't wanna go bottle for bottle
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
'Cause all I ever fuck with is models (yeah)
I'm a motherfucking player, my nigga (player)
If she bad, I'ma slay her my nigga, yeah
Stunting ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Pimping ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Balling ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Popping bottles, that ain't nothing to me (ain't nothin')
Driving foreign cars ain't nothin' to me
That ain't nothin' to me (I'm stunting, yeah)
Stunting ain't nothin' to me
Look at this shit, it ain't nothin' to me (ayy)

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Nah, that ain't nothing to me
Boy, I get money in my sleep
Buy a new car every week
Get a new bitch everyday, ayy
Fuck what you heard, fuck what you say
Send them hitters where you stay
You don't wanna go shooter for shooter
You don't wanna go million for million
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
I got bitches in Hawaii (yeah)
I got bitches down in Houston
Some millionaires and some boosting
Might call your bitch to make a movie
And you know it's X rated
Like you know my weed strong
And this Sprite I'm drinking medicated
Break out the dice, let's shoot (let's shoot)
I'm selfish, I only buy coupes (coupes)
Told a bitch to bring one friend
Hardheaded ass bitch brought two
Look one of them in the eye, said
"I already fucked you, why she brought you?"
I'm a player, these bitches, they love me
In the club passing out bubbly (just take that)
Bitch, I'm the shit like Ruffin (David)
Can't a nigga tell me nothing (it's Dolph)
I'm out in Hollywood drugging (drugging)
Young nigga paid and thugging (yeah)
Dolce Gabbana tuxedo (ha)
Trap nigga like Nino (brown)
Just had a bad bitch trio
One Mexican and one Creole (ha)

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Nigga please, you ain't got as much guap as me
You don't wanna go dollar for dollar
You don't wanna go bottle for bottle
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
'Cause all I ever fuck with is models (yeah)
I'm a motherfucking player, my nigga (player)
If she bad, I'ma slay her my nigga, yeah
Stunting ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Pimping ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Balling ain't nothin' to me (ain't nothin')
Popping bottles, that ain't nothing to me (ain't nothin')
Driving foreign cars ain't nothin' to me
That ain't nothin' to me (I'm stunting, yeah)
Stunting ain't nothin' to me
Look at this shit, it ain't nothin' to me (ayy)
