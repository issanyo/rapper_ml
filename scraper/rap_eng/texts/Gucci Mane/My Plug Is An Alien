[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I stack money like it grow off a tree
My nose up like the police told my gunners to freeze
I'm in a chevy its 100 degrees, but with these grown Giovanni's its a 100 degrees

[So Icey Boy Version]
I stack money like it grow off a tree
My nose up like the police told my gunners to freeze
I stack money like it grow off a tree
My nose up like the police told my gunners to freeze
I stack money like it grow off a tree
My nose up like the police told my gunners to freeze
Freeze!
Music Please!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I stack money like it grow off a tree
My nose up like the police told my gunners to freeze
I'm in a chevy its 100 degrees, but with these grown Giovanni's its a 100 degrees
Got money stashed in a box keep a hundred at least
Four old school verts cost a hundred a piece
100 bricks in the six it ain't easy to breathe
The way these snitches telling on me its so hard to be me
I'm shitting on the industry retarded with me a toilet with me
I should have rolled the short bus cause it's retarded on me
I stank the booth up like a nigga just farted you see
I'm in a quarter mil car, but in the passenger's seat
I keep a top notch rev on to push the beat
And it's chinchilla pink where she resting her feet
And it's straight interior as far you see
I got the whole Boulder Crest and East Atlanta with me

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I think my plug from Outer space man (Space man)
I think my plug is an Alien (An Alien)
I beat the dope like a cavemen (A Caveman)
I got more whips than a slave man (A Slave Man)
I'm rock on chains like a sleigh man (A Sleigh Man)
I think my plug from Outer space man (Space man)
I think my plug is an Alien (An Alien)
Because his number is so crazy man (Crazy Man)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm too high, with two twins, and no top with two Glocks
Outside of my trap spot like a Benz lot
Inside of this Benz coupe, look like soup
Terminator, all red, all said, nough said, top's back, seat back, im back, Zay track
71 air dawg and still got that 8 track
Old 8 vette and its squatting like a red
Red rag on me so every day a hair day
Sixteen five every time I hear my ringtone
Money on my mind and my phone is a payphone
One stop, sell more birds than a pet shop
Glock on my hip so I guess I'm not with hip-hop
I got stones on my neck like I went home from bedrock
Push that ganja out like a hood boy with dreadlocks
Jumped in the shower, but my dunk get his rims washed
Open the brain and I got my whole hood high
Went to the mall and I got my whole hood fly
Went to the mall and I got my whole hood fly
