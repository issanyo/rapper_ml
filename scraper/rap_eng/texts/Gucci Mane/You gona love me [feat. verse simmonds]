Baby you gon love me
See I know yall ladies

Yall used to fuckin with just us
Baby you gon love me
But you ever fucked with a trap god before?

(Hook: Verse Simmonds)
We ain’t lookin at the price tag, fuck that

You gon love me, you gon love me
See I got enough to get yo life right
Money make you come, we gon be fuckin all night

[Verse: Gucci Mane)
I can’t lie, I’m into you
Baby what you finna do?
Yea I’m on some other shit
My hoes don’t wear no tennis shoes
I put you on the money, baby roll with me you never lose
I’ll take you to a island, fly you places you ain’t never been
Every day’s a business move, your boyfriend tighter than a drum
I’m richer than the average nigga, baby I wouldn’t lie to you
When I say you fine as fuck, baby girl I ain’t tryna flatter you
But yo boyfriend is a rainbow and he tryin to overshadow you
Gucci Mane splatter you, I’m the one she walkin to
I’m sippin Absolute, I change the longitude and latitude
Bitch show me some gratitude, wussup with this attitude?
You mad these bitches jockin me, they met me ‘cause I’m jockin you

(Hook: Verse Simmonds)
We ain’t lookin at the price tag, fuck that
Baby if you like that, you get that
You gon love me, you gon love me
You gon love me, you gon love me
See I got enough to get yo life right
Money make you come, we gon be fuckin all night
You gon love me, you gon love me
You gon love me, you gon love me
