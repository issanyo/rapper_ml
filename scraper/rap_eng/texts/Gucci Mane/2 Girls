[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
I got my girl dancing with another girl
I got my girl grinding on another girl
And I love it when they dancing
Girl on girl, girl on girl, girl on girl
I got my girl dancing with another girl
I got my girl grinding on another girl
And I love it when they dancing
Girl on girl, girl on girl, girl on girl

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
My girl dancing with fine women
Fine with me, she poison, Mike Pippings
Manolo said it, that girl is a lesbian
Holter top, Alexander leggings on
Plus she white girl wasted
2 white girls on the dance floor naked
She's grinding on her, my eyes low from the medical, one up
When it's all said and done can we fornicate?
Take you out your birthday suit, eat your birthday cake
It's phantoms and them Bentley's when them homies roll
The mansion like an old loop video
So much siroc they think I'm diddy yo
2 models dancing, looking like centerfolds
And my pockets full of knots, from them bank rolls
Castelle on them boozy ass stake hoes

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
I got my girl dancing with another girl
I got my girl grinding on another girl
And I love it when they dancing
Girl on girl, girl on girl, girl on girl
I got my girl dancing with another girl
I got my girl grinding on another girl
And I love it when they dancing
Girl on girl, girl on girl, girl on girl

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Grind down grilly, fine hoe silly
Drinking ace of spade till they ass get thrilly
Gucci's just chillin, Ned's just chillin
Got a colt 45 just like dilly
I'm smoking on piffy, I'm like King Griffith
Knocking home ones cause my nigga just dripping
I'm a be a billionaire if God willing
Money to the ceiling that's how the squad feeling
Girls on girls, girls on girls
Going animal like squirrel on squirrel
Brick squad world, Gucci Mane here
White in the club with the quarter mill ears

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
I got my girl dancing with another girl
I got my girl grinding on another girl
And I love it when they dancing
Girl on girl, girl on girl, girl on girl
I got my girl dancing with another girl
I got my girl grinding on another girl
And I love it when they dancing
Girl on girl, girl on girl, girl on girl
