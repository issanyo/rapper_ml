[Verse 1]
I got on 15 diamond chains like I’m a slave man
Drag her by her hair like I’m a cave man
She gave me a block of money when I got out of jail
I told her we gon buy a bale, bitch let’s buy us a bale
I love cooking cocaina man but I hate the smell of it
Niggas snitching on me wanna go and call 12 and shit
My bitch so bad that I might just buy a V12 for that
I don’t miss being on Big Cat but I miss all of them scraps and shit
Niggas riding with me 17, 18, ain’t got gas and shit
I think I need some mice traps cause my hood full rats ya bitch (mices)
Hood nigga from Bouldercrest, but I got this classic dick
Producing my own movies, turn your bitch to an actress
Guwop tell 'em turn up nigga, and all of this classic shit
And I’m in East Atlanta zuwoping like old dirty bastard did
Tryna stop wrist [?] like sinking the Titanic bitch
Brick squad 1017, I gives a fuck bout Atlantic bitch

[Hook]
These fuck niggas ain’t getting no money, these fuck niggas ain’t getting no money
Small time nigga and you still getting fronted
Talking big money, but ain’t got no money
These fuck niggas ain’t getting no money, these fuck niggas ain’t getting no money
Small time nigga and you still getting fronted
Talking big money, but ain’t got no money

[Verse 2]
Kiss your bitch, she got more money than most these rappers got
Guwop, I got more bales, bricks than probably most of these trappers got
Say you in the bando but I don’t see no dope my nig
And Guwop is so dangerous he might just kidnap your kids
I got this wig on but man I’m not doing drag ya bitch
I’m on some [?] shit, I just might kidnap your bitch
Say you’re trapping hard but your tryna kidnap a bitch
I’m the type of niggas that get texts when I attack your clique
Ran up on the plug cause a nigga went broke
I ain’t give a damn cause he had no hope
Gucci got boats like 34 and these boats here cost 34
30 something hundred if a nigga ain’t on it
Remember when the badge cost 85 hundred?
[?] HD coming through the SD so many PTs probably need an RV

[Hook]
These fuck niggas ain’t getting no money, these fuck niggas ain’t getting no money
Small time nigga and you still getting fronted
Talking big money, but ain’t got no money
These fuck niggas ain’t getting no money, these fuck niggas ain’t getting no money
Small time nigga and you still getting fronted
Talking big money, but ain’t got no money
