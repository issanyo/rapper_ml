[Intro:Gucci Mane]
Okay
BURR
I'm walkin on air, air
Said I'm walkin on air, air
Ha, ha
Bangladesh

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Well I'm high talkin, I'm sky walkin
Like Skywalker I'm slick talker
Put the bitch on you, take the bitch off you
She's a liar, she from lie dog
I'm in the SS and I'm bench dress
She's the devil in a red dress
Escalades like a carburetor
I'm gon pull up, we gon get it poppin baby
I'm in the kitchen with er and we 2 fuckin
Got this cocaine moonwalking
Use code names, we be chiken talkin
In the tuna, take whippin off you
She a shoe addict, she a coke addict
She a dope addict, she from Sun Valley
And then we count it up, there's a pimp rally
Man this bitch is so alley
Got a white girl, I'm a wife beater
On the brand of out, that mean white peep
Yea the right people made the price cheaper
And I swear then don't even really like people
Will show her dress and then I side peep
For her If I had to, Id fight people
She ill with it and illegal
I think I need to call my paralegal

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
They ask me how I feel, I say I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning and start bustin swishas
They ask me how it taste, I say it taste delicious
Early in the morning and I'm drinkin liquor
They ask me how I feel, I said I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning, had to make decisions
Jet, Beamer, Vette, Bentley or the fuckin Benzes
I don't know which one to pick and that shit feels terrific

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
May your next move be your best move
Make your best move be the right, mane
White Range with the wide range
Make your life change for the light change
I was the on the right thing with my right brain
Til your wife came to my night change
Loud music and a party
So when I pull up, my goodnight mane
My pull up game is just beautiful
My car collection is critical
Yea I'm sorry, I'm like Stevie Wonder
I don't see these niggas, they invisible
Sorry I've been so disrespectful
I'll try to be more considerable
Industry port is too political
Pull up in my car, not typical
I'm a business man with a business plan
Used to whip it in the park for the extra bands
Stir stir stir for the extra grams
What they thinkin? Gucci Mane got extra hands
Take the grinds on my hand and I make a fan
Take the bands off my hand then I make you dance
Got a cover and a plug like a avalanche
Swag so sick call it everlast

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
They ask me how I feel, I say I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning and start bustin swishas
They ask me how it taste, I say it taste delicious
Early in the morning and I'm drinkin liquor
They ask me how I feel, I said I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning, had to make decisions
Jet, Beamer, Vette, Bentley or the fuckin Benzes
I don't know which one to pick and that shit feels terrific

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I got no conscience, I got no top
You own a glass house, you shouldn't throw rocks
Got no friends, I got no sense
I might pull up with bout 4 Glocks
Yea these horsemen so get this junction
All red Rari, it's a pumpkin
It's runnin like an auction
When I wake up I got options
All my hoes sell blow for me
All my hoes on go for me
Never gon get caught hopefully
Get caught burned out instantly
All money I ever seen, put me in position I never been
Countin up that 50 green, my truck rollin like 50 blings
And I don't pay er money, I just buy er clothes
And she can't feel her face, but really who needs the nose?
We snowed in in South Beach and it don't ever snow
I think my friends only my friends because my price is low

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
They ask me how I feel, I say I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning and start bustin swishas
They ask me how it taste, I say it taste delicious
Early in the morning and I'm drinkin liquor
They ask me how I feel, I said I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning, had to make decisions
Jet, Beamer, Vette, Bentley or the fuckin Benzes
I don't know which one to pick and that shit feels terrific
