[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Young Gucci Mane, Aim off in the building
Young Gucci Mane, Aim off in the building

[Verse 1: Dat Boy Aim]
I got a fresh pair of J's, even got the socks ho
Ma used to ask boy what you keep the box for?
Ain't none' Ma, just a lil stash
She ain't really know her baby boy gettin' cash
Step out on the block, you know how the song go
Pocket full of stones, hood ain't never hot though
Got fifty pounds of dro, all in my stash spot
Hoes get my number mane, swear they hit the jackpot
She just wanna ride with the fly boy mascot
Knot so big it can't even fit my pants pocket
Uh, I'm just a superstar on the block
With twenty-five thousand dollars worth of profit in my shoe box

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Fifty pounds of dro, every day is a Friday
Pull up to my house, you can smell it from the driveway
Smokin' on this gangster, them niggas call it 2Pac
Twenty-thousand dollars worth of profit in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
Twenty-thousand dollars worth of profit in my shoebox

[Verse 2: Dat Boy Aim]
I'm up early doin' mathematics
Twenty-five shoeboxs off in the attic
No bank account, no trace to the boss
Got enough supply to bring Kobe to the Hawks, uh
And it's all independent money
Hugh Heffner, keep a bunch of pretty bunnies
Yeah, the money still flowing in
I cop shoes for a box just to throw it in
Good soda, stay poured up
Gucci on it so you know it's gon' blow up
Beat so hard I ain't have to show up
Give them J's a lil bit, then they want some more, what

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Fifty pounds of dro, every day is a Friday
Pull up to my house, you can smell it from the driveway
Smokin' on this gangster, them niggas call it 2Pac
Twenty-thousand dollars worth of profit in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
Twenty-thousand dollars worth of profit in my shoebox

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Fifty pounds of dro, every day is a Friday
Pull up to my house, you can smell it from the driveway
Smokin' on this gas 'til them niggas call it 2Pac
Twenty-thousand dollars worth of profit in my shoebox
What you lookin' at, keep a pound in the console
All a nigga do rap, smoke dro, and fuck hoes
Young Gucci Mane, Aim off in the building
Niggas throwin' hate then we kidnapping children
Niggas couldn't get me to sign for a million
I don't really rap, I just speak on how I'm living
Got so much money I could give myself a contract
Blow so much smoke, I could give the world a contact
Streetwise, mafia ties, we wise guys
Despised by these rich ass niggas that's tellin' lies
Steady doin' shoes but they ain't gettin' money though
What you lookin' at, a young nigga smokin' plenty dro

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Fifty pounds of dro, every day is a Friday
Pull up to my house, you can smell it from the driveway
Smokin' on this gangster, them niggas call it 2Pac
Twenty-thousand dollars worth of profit in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
Twenty-thousand dollars worth of profit in my shoebox
Fifty pounds of dro, every day is a Friday
Pull up to my house, you can smell it from the driveway
Smokin' on this gangster, them niggas call it 2Pac
Twenty-thousand dollars worth of profit in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
In my shoebox, in my, in my shoebox
Twenty-thousand dollars worth of profit in my shoebox
