Verse 1:
They call me King Guap (I’m dripping)
I rock a clean watch, I think I iced out
Drop my top its smashed out, fresh up
Out of the feds, y’all niggas got old guap
She had more  kids, (Gucci) I got more guap
My diamonds real, my gang severe, my wrist a brrr
My ills on chills, quit looking at me she licking on me
While I stay in the air, I’m hot as the fire, I'm Gucci la flare
But I'm cold as a bear, i was a young fella, picking up gang
From the old players, finding me 10 square now lucky I'm millionaire, i don’t drink lean no more cuz I ain't got time
To be fat as hell, and Gucci not going to jail, Imma murderer but I'm not going to hell (GUAP)
