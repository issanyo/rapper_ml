[Verse 1]
All white mink for my freaks, I'mma rich treat
Black bitch pussy very pink sit it on a sink
Diamond ring only made for kings cost me 80g
Expensive gold on my watch and teeth cost a 100g
Rose gold V-V-V-v-v-v its a sight to see
Two girls and its only me do yall wanna geek
Quarter P of that Miley Skii do you wanna skii
East Atlanta no water around but we on a the beach
Red B cost ya 350 get ya one of these
Since its me you wanna be then go head and get one for me
My momma said she couldn't feed no sissy so guess what pass me the beef
And collard greens and lots of beets cus i like dope and lots of weed

[Verse 2]
I eat nails for breakfast eat bricks for lunch
I got them bricks i mail them

Investigating trying to sell me celery

They can't wait me to slip so they can chef me
Thank the cartel because they got me wealthy
And i will be wealthy everyday I'm healthy

Convict for some shit they know I'm guilty
How fucking knowing you fucking with me
