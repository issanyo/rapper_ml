[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, I heard these niggas sneak dissin' on the low
These niggas don't like me all 'cause a ho, yeah
I been getting hundreds ever since I changed my flow, yeah
These fuck niggas keep calling me
Had to change my phone, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Had to slam my door, hey, had to slam my door
Mr. mix, the yellow with white gold
I'mma keep bagging this dough, yeah
You gon' keep stealing my flows yeah
You the Lil Uzi typo
Yeah, your career, that shit on a tightrope
But I'm all for that
Let me stop 'fore you get sad
'Cause I'm really your dad, yeah
If you want fire with that
Invader Zim 'cause I'm not from this earth
I'm blocking my haters like Shaq
Look at them niggas, who dat?
Diamonds, they white and blue, black
My chain a hunnid, yo' shit cost two stacks

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, I heard these niggas sneak dissin' on the low
These niggas don't like me all 'cause a ho, yeah
I been getting hundreds ever since I changed my flow, yeah
These fuck niggas keep calling me
Had to change my phone, yeah
Had to slam my door, hey, had to slam my door
Mr. mix, the yellow with white gold

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
All these niggas dissing me, all these niggas dissing me
I'm signed to me, I'm managed by me
Shit, I feel like I'm pimpin' me
Huh, these hoes simpin' me
Huh, take 'em to Tiffany's
Just had an epiphany
That bitch ain't bad, she ain't meant for me
None of these niggas ain't feeling me
'Cause none of these rappers ain't real as me
Drop top Beamer from Germany
Me and Uzi skrt in these Philly streets
Nigga said he my enemy
Wanna be friends when he bumped into me
These suckers ain't what they pretend to be
Honestly, you don't wanna go to war with me
Draco turn you to an amputee
Dump your body in the ocean with a manatee
Make your whole clique do the Mannequin Challenge
When I draw down with this AR-15
Yeah, nigga, AR with me
Strip, nigga, porn star with me
Quick draw McGraw with me
Came over, flip cars with me

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, heard these niggas sneak dissin' on the low
These niggas don't like me all 'cause a ho, yeah
I been getting hundreds ever since I changed my flow, yeah
These fuck niggas keep calling me, had to change my phone, yeah
Had to slam my door, hey, had to slam my door
Mr. mix, the yellow with white gold
I'mma keep bagging this dough
I been getting hundreds ever since I changed my flow, yeah
These fuck niggas keep calling me
Had to change my phone, yeah
