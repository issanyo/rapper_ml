[Chorus]
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it

[Verse 1]
Dipped in a roller, roller fish caught in the middle winter
Feel back on the low, got them numbers on the scalers
Why you wanna fuck on that boy that shot you up
I'm that nigga in the hood, drinking liquor iced up
I'm the one you wanna see, if you wanna buy some D
I'm the nigga V-I-P, smoking in front the police
I'm the one don't really care
I'm the one who take it there, and it's Fatboy on the track
And this Gucci man La Flair
Haters thought it's over, but it's only the beginning
Never made lead rapper, but I'm thinking the independent Bitches tell the vision Gucci mane bought a Bentley
I'm a trapholic century, the hottest thang that hit the city
Gucci!

[Chorus]
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it

[Verse 2]
So icy silver hoe, born to twist goran
And I'm dealing with my niggas, tryna fly on this scrilla
Said I hear of you niggas,I ain't hear of you hoes
Grind on the fours with the Lamborghini doors
So icy stupid bright, crazy chain dumb (dumb)
Would of charged a charm with the short but that's retarded
Money
Damn Gucci Mane La Flair, put it in the air yo
Put it in my hoe leave, bitches except my earlobe

[Chorus - x2]
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it

[Bridge]
Drop a whole 40, glide the whole 30
Chrome 30, 30, that's gotten all snorty
Shotgun shorty got more then one body
But no club rowdy, but don't tell nobody
Gucci!

[Chorus]
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it
