[Hook][x4]
I think I'm 'bout to overdose with diamonds mane
I got on all these motherfuckin' diamond chains

[Verse 1]
[?] forgies gone roll a long way from selling dope
Got a brick and I'm still served up
1017 show no nigga love
10 to 12 diamond chains in the glove
Diamond chains pinky rings
[?] these real diamonds fuck you think
1017 sinner going hard in the fucking paint
Remember buying lines, now a nigga buying fucking pints
Iced out cuban link, diamonds going insane
Gotta shout to my jeweler real nigga [?] bank

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I think I'm 'bout to overdose on molly mane
I dare a nigga put his hands on my diamond chain
I'm sucha hater hater kiss my rollie rollie mane
Dope boy earrings cost about a hundred things
Over over extra extra just to get that pinky ring
1017 chain mane same price as a musang
Damn [?] getting all the fame
Put the bitch the diamond color
Niggas with your dented chain better go back to robbing

[Hook][x4]
