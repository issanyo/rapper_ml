[Intro: Aoc Obama]
We watchin’ you boys
I got the trap god in here with me
Spend that money lil nigga
Let’s see how big you is
I mean you came here for a reason right?
You don’t see that thick ass bitch over there?
What you scared of that sexy shit or something?

[Chorus: Aoc Obama]
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
I’ma bust it open just to show her I’m gettin’ it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
I’ma bust it open just to show her I’m gettin’ it

[Verse 1: Aoc Obama]
I make it, she make it
I’m makin’ it, fuck it, let’s spend it
They ran out of ones, I’m throwin’ these twenties and fifties
She bustin’ it open, she shakin’ it, poppin’ it, gettin’ it
I’m over here diamond dancing, my money to the ceiling
She over there showing out, she poppin’ it from the ceiling
She leaving with garbage bags, she know she made a killing
She over there shaking it like she got to feed her children
I’m over iced out like I hit the mega millions
I really be gettin’ it, I’m killin’ the internet
I make it rain but I really ain’t into that
You ever seen that boss bitch shawty from the back?
Even made my pimpin’ ass throw a stack

[Chorus: Aoc Obama]
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
I’ma bust it open just to show her I’m gettin’ it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
I’ma bust it open just to show her I’m gettin’ it

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Throwin’ money up, I need twenty thousand in singles
I can give a fuck if homeboy play for the Bengals
I pull up in a Bel Air in rare condition
I might just fuck the waitress in rare Givenchy
Watching the game at the club just to pass time
A nigga damn near threw a dub before halftime
I told her she can’t come, I got a bad vibe
So her friend won this meat by a landslide
I think I stuck my dick in a goldmine
I hit the booth and baby sucked that dick the whole time
The money wet, she gotta hang it on a clothesline
I really wanna cut her off but she so fine

[Chorus: Aoc Obama]
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
I’ma bust it open just to show her I’m gettin’ it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
Baby she shakin’ it like she want me to spend it
I’ma bust it open just to show her I’m gettin’ it
