[Hook: Gucci Mane ]
I got a tractor trailer cramed with powder
I got a van slamed down with pills
Got a whip that got a stash for bricks
I got a muthafuckin' trap on wheels (x4)
I pull up and I hit you with this
I got a muthafuckin' trap on wheels

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Got a trapper and the trail went global
Rollin' drug store my trap went mobile
Fifty thousand on a motorolla
60 pounds in the damn Corolla
I lost a sister she a hell of shoulder
She kept her mouth closed just like I told her
When she get out im a buy her a Rover
I got the crazy dope, my dope bi polar
Helpin' hand, I put my hand on yo shoulder
In the street I give you the cold shoulder
Afford the lean and afford this blow
I made a racing car outta my nose
I hit a hundred thousand just in the motor
So when I pull up on you niggas it's over
I'm smokin' purple right in front of you workers, I'm in the zone
Got a hundred Zones, will knock out yo business don't use the phone
Betta watch yo tone of voice, fuck boy
I got a tone
Got a gun that kill an elephant nigga, don't get me wrong
I put my trap house on Forgis nigga, I'm in the zone
Baby bottles, gotta pistol and a scale inside  [?]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Mr. Ice Cream man, but I ain't got no fuckin' ice cream
It's a traphouse on wheels, ice cream truck with Forgis
Got dope, for sure, who made this beat? C4
Who got the streets? You know, you niggas don't rap bout dope
You still haven't jumped off the porch, private jet to New York
Made of steel, won't bend, I say nothin' in court
Guwop got a trap on wheels
Guwop got a trap on wheels
Since enrolled, trappin' at my mommas shill [?]
If ya a trap nigga, I know you're gonna trap, that is

[Hook]
