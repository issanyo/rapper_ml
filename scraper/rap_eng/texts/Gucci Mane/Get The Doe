[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's iced out shawty
Your bitch wanna fuck with me, I don't doubt it
Gucci Mane show man, the club so crowded
Got a mean watch on me, cost a cool 140
I'm the center of attention, watch these hoes stand round me
I took a picture with your bitch, I don't know why you allowed it
We check the strong pack in, yeah my kush is the loudest
And my name ring bells, different countries and counties
They had a bounty on my chain, how the fuck they found it
I blow so much purp that I can't stay grounded
6's on my skraight 8 Jeep, yea it's mounted
A nigga say he jack me, how the fuck that sounded?

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
200 cash, that's on the floor
I got 100 bands going out the door
Bitch kiss my ass, fuck them foes
I'm hustling hard baby, gotta get the doe
200 cash, layin' on the floor
I got 100 bands going out the door
Kiss my ass, bitch fuck them foes
I'm hustling hard bitch, I gotta get the doe

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm hustling hard, bitch I gotta get the doe
I'm Coca Cola sellin' soda, whippin' it in the bowl
I'm flippin', I'm flippin', I'm flippin', I'm flippin', I'm shittin' like on the commode
I'm sackin', I'm freezin', I'm flippin' that Cola, you niggas be sellin' your soul
This here shit is gettin' crazy, niggas are gettin' bold
These niggas will tell on they mama. It hit the fan, they act like hoes
I'm goin' my loop with steel-toed boots, so niggas can't step on my toes
I'm cockin' my pistol and smoking these swishers, I'm bout to lose control
I'm workin that show like I'm flippin that dope, my pockets are super swole
Ride through the trap and I got that scrap, don't know who's friend or foe
These niggas'll blow your head, I'll just pour a ounce of blow
And since you ran off with a brick then watch this stick blow off your nose

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rocko]
Soon as I enter, pussy niggas exit
Ball like the arena, go home with all that flexin'
Real street niggas in your area, we ain’t goin' for it, we dare ya
F'in Glock carrier, we gon' bury ya
All the bitches hysterical, they know how I kick it
Sat watchin' ass nigga, you ain't come to spend it, why the fuck you here
Poor hustlin' ass nigga, 100 bands in my ear
On the left and right pocket, 50 bands in my rear
Born champion, gladiator, conquered all my fields
Been alive for 30 years, I been getting money for 20 year
I’m with Gucci, that my brother from another mother
Brothers of the same struggle, still in the trap house, we so gutter

[Hook]
