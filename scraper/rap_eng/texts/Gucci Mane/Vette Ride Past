[Hook: Gucci Mane]

Vette pass by, everybody looking
Six stoves in the house and everybody cooking
Wrist like blaow, chain like oww
We throw it in the air, to watch it come down

You riding vert (wheewh)
Them bullets go (wheewh)
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu (x2)

[Verse 1: Gucci]

This house is stupid perp, they cost me half a rack
AK half a stack, so we ain't gon hit back
I'm at the gambling house, I won bout 80 bands
And went to Magic City, and did the rain dance
I'm the cave man, stupid bad man
Rubberband man, I'm extra gram Sam
A stupid fruity sack, a stupid fruity pack
Crazy Gucci shoes, where you get em at?
I said it's all white, 'bout a fifty pack
The hottest nigga in the nation ain't dropped yet
Where them pots at? Where them Glocks at?
I keep the dough weird, where them plots at?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci]
Cartoon chain, papa smurf rang
All red wangs, So Icy airplane
Gucci man hat, Gucci man shirt
Louie V shoes, Louie v purp
We ain't the Big Tymers, but bitch we got work
We get our roll on in new school verts
Old school's cool, but most of our's new
Gesundheit bitch, we got the bird flu
But we'll bless you, so say achoo
We'll turn them house shoes, into some Prada shoes
On the east side, we play by Gucci rules
He's only in the hood, when he's commissioned to

[Hook]

[OJ Da Juiceman]

The bird flu got me, the Jacob watch Rocky
Balboa'd the diamond now, I'm So Icy
Young Juice Man godddamit I'm the shit
Boomin' off the chain working with 50 bricks
Now-a-later cars, creu blue chains

Been a 100 charger, sneaker color dump
Super bad bitch Ay! Pocket with the mumps Ay!
Common cold nigga, Ay! This ain't what you want Ay!
72 donk, Ay! With no skirt!
Whoa, six stoves cookin' mean we got work!
Young, Juiceman ,cuz, smokin' nine pounds of purp
