[Intro]
Aggressive
Hah, grrr, grrr, grrr
Hah, grrrr, it's Wizop, grrrr, hah
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive

[Verse 1]
I'm Gucci Mane the legend, I don't fuck with you peasants
I'm too heavy to be petty, boy is you balling or begging?
Please stop calling me, nigga, 'cause I can't spare not a second
I gives a fuck bout a record, I got a criminal record
These boys so scared of big Gucci, they make subliminal records
Most of these rappers is pussy, they making feminine records
It ain't a nigga in the industry that I wanna meet
Your favorite rapper a sucker that's not surprising to me
You can't be talking to the police then try signing with me
I ain't cosigning these niggas, I'm only vouching for me
I ain't letting these soft ass niggas stand on no couches with me
You niggas wasn't in no trap house stacking up ounces with me, pussy

[Chorus]
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive

[Verse 2]
I'm a business of building the man with the millions
You'se collateral damage cause boy you just a civilian
You'se a sheep in a wolf outfit boy you just a chameleon
And you blend in good, but I'll hurt more than your feelings
I'm a monster, a mobster, a contract killer
I'm a convict, a conman, an ex-drug dealer
I'm the bricks man, hit man, jack boy, kick man
Knock your door off the hinges, I hit big licks and
All my people like heaters, we don't like features
We love each other, but we don't like people
We crazy and violent and they can't teach us
Preachers couldn't reach us but the hoes gon' greet us
Cause we balling on you suckers, bitch want more on the bleachers
You niggas real dick riders, male cheerleaders
And you can't compete with Gucci so just follow the leader
Cause I'm still that boy from Zone 6 that might follow your Regal, pussy

[Chorus]
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive

[Outro]
Grrr
