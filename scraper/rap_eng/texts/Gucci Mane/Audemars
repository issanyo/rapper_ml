[Chorus]
I'm gettin' money, I'm ballin' hard
Heard them niggas hatin on me, cause they fallin' off
Honestly bitch, I'm ballin' hard
Yeah It's my time, and I'mma shine just like my Audemars, my audemars
Bust down, and iced out
Just hit the switch, that bitch be shining when the lights out
Bust down, and iced out
Look at my wrist, that bitch be shining like a lighthouse
I spit a verse, that's like a point
I do it short, that's like a joint
That's like a bird, oh nigga you ain't heard
I'm in the mixin like a saute when it's gettin stirred
Pull up in the Maserati, got them bitches lookin' at me like I shot somebody
I'm stackin' paper, I need that dropped Ferrari
Got them trying to claim a nigga and we not on Maury
My AP, cool as an A/C
Look in the magazine, the same exact as Jay-Z (Same one)
I'm gettin' money, nigga you straight flea
That bitch be shining thunder up I call it KD
I'm ballin' in this bitch like it's my motherfucking born day
Bout to get a swiss account, so fuck bout what the forms say
I just did 100 shows, ain't never get a tour date
MMG we winning bitch, go check what the score say

[Chorus]
Hundred stacks, Frank watch
Mill at the crib with them tools out
Money nigga, head huntin'
Big timer, rap hunter
Uptown soldier on the battlefield
Big timer blood gettin killa kill
High roller been doing this since the 90s bitch
Flippin' birds shippin' how we did this shit
Swag dawg, the money hangin'
A hundred stacks, been bangin'
High roller, shock collar
Ferrari speed, niggas been ballin'
Cherry on them flakes when we on the mound
Fire on that candy blowin' out the pound
Bad bitch stand 6 feet, standin' on this money bought a new fleet

[Chorus]
Look at my wrist, that shit 200 hundred thou'
Cut the lights down, look at me now
Back then they didn't want me, now I'm hot and they all on me
Pull a bunch of these white bitches, I'm chillin hard at the Pink Pony
Gucci Mane and Meek Mills, I'm ballin hard, I'm too trill
New ride with new money, so I had to put it on new rims
Hawks game, I'm court side
Red bottles on the wet floor, give them up to the athletes
Smellin' like a pound of dro, Versace shades I'm yoked out
Rolls Royce it smoked out, parked in front your whole house
I blew the horn, she jumped out
Maybach on cascade, the one on down my west side
4 girls, only fucked 3
Cause one left, and she missed out

[Chorus]
