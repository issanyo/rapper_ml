I'm booming, I'm banking, I'm serving all the baddest
Rap game easy but the dope game gravy
Young Juiceman and my life is like the Jake, yeah
With stupid fruity crazy swag, jumping in yo ladies

Banana donk Chevy, interior like the Lakers
Lebron James wrist when I'm fucking with that caper
Hit the trap, stay down, watch the paper rakers
Booming out the house and J's asking for a wake up

Half a brick, whole brick, got me buying Jake-a
Where is you, walking in the head of innogator?

The twerking birds in, so we working
Packing a truck, stop, a trailer back in
We big flip jug, we tote it off the forklift
The way my blood kicking ya think he had a black belt

My scale so big, boy can weight its damn self
2000 pounds of mid, I sold that shit my damn self
Washer full of cash, dryer full of X pills
Red rag in my pocket, same color my 'Vette is

My number lower than a ese from Texas
A quarter mill and then a million's in investment
I'm sniper rifle like a soldier in the desert
A eagle on me boy, I'm known to tote a desert

I sack the ounce up before I sold a raptor
He want a brick, I told him meet me by the chapter
I sack the pound up before I sold a raptor
He want a bit, I told him meet me by the chapter

Young Juiceman, goddammit on da shit
Booming on the chain, working with 50 freaks
1000 pound bail, trying to make a mega grill
Posted on the crez with that 45 on my heel

34, 34 tucked behind my leel
Town 60 dog with that extra leel
502 donk dog with the extra kicks
I got no stupid bank 'cause I got that stupid wheel
