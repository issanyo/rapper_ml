[Verse 1- Gucci Mane]
Ballin' in the club cause this is my city
I'm on ciroc, then a boy P-Diddy
Bad little bitch used to talk real slick
Got a real fat ass and her hair so pretty
Ain't even 8, but we drunk already
Ain't even dated, but we fucked already
Got an ounce and a half got it tucked in the stash
Dont come to my pad ,Don't touch my Chevy
Call me a litle player, I'm a rich ass nigga
Do a 13, don't spill my liquor
Girlfriend say that she dig a nigga
Wanna kick with it a nigga like a field goal kicker
Back to the basics, stay smoking grape shit
Code name Gucci, but my real name Radric
Club like the matrix
Hate pussy niggas, but I love big faces
I'm so wasted

[Hook- Gucci]
I don't know what to do with all these big faces
Got a nigga going all these big places
Big face watch with the big bracelet
Gucci, Mike Will, Back 2 Tha Basics
(X2)

[Verse 2- Gucci Mane]
I ain't got time to be fucking with you
I'm losing money fucking with you
I come through in my Bentley coupe
But I forgot to bring the roof
Ain't got time to talk to you
My money do the talking, baby
Drop the top on my Mercedes
My car so sick it went to Grady
Ain't got time to sleep with you
I got some other shit to do
Break off the brick and cook a deuce
I call it chicken noodle soup

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Waka Flocka Flame]
I think it was my white ?, I think it was my white neck
Big faces, dead men
Shawty got the check
4 million up next year, I put that on my set
T-top, two-door, red corvette
I think it was the drink that fucked up the old sets
Pulled in vallet, hopped in VIP
Smoke this kush, dog, like it's legal, T
Me and my bad bitch, just me and my bad bitch
Big dawg with me so you better stay in line
Broke niggas to the left, boy you not my kind
Big faces, big yacht master too
I'm doing big shows, YG in big places

[Hook]
