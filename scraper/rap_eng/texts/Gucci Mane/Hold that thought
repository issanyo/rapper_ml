Zaytoven on tracks
Zay-Tiggy, Gucci, Gucci
So I'll tell, let's go
They call me Chef-Boy-R.G. but I hold dat thought
It's a Kodak moment how I hold dat thought
Got a hurricane wrist game, turn that junk off
Hot as Piggly Wiggly, can't Kermit the frog dog
They call me Chef-Boy-R.G. but I hold dat thought
It's a Kodak moment how I hold dat thought
Got a hurricane wrist game, turn that junk off
Hot as Piggly Wiggly, can't Kermit the frog dog
Early in the mornin', I ain't even yawnin'
Cookin' up a cake like I'm doin' a performance
When it come to flossin', I ain't even talkin'
Diamonds on my tongue, got my Chevy moonwalkin'
Ten bricks on my Bart Simpson, just look
My watch, 35 pounds of kush
My ring, 36 oz's my nig
My bracelet, 500 pounds of mid
A Gucci wrapped tour bus, y'all hoes follow us
Party pack pills man, hoes gonna swallow us
Naturally a loner but love my kid
Mix the soda with the cola, I can buy me a friend
New swag somethin' like trap house times ten
Every nigga 'round me bust heads, ya dig
Iced out grill, I can't buy that bullshit
I'm wit' some street shit like a reverend in the pulpit
They call me Chef-Boy-R.G. but I hold dat thought
It's a Kodak moment how I hold dat thought
Got a hurricane wrist game, turn that junk off
Hot as Piggly Wiggly, can't Kermit the frog dog
The Chef-Boy-R.G. but I hold dat thought
It's a Kodak moment how I hold dat thought
Got a hurricane wrist game, turn that junk off
Hot as Piggly Wiggly, can't Kermit the frog dog
Like ya boi Rip Ham, I got a real good jay
One gram for the eighty, that's some real good play
Got them Vince Carter quartas add soda and water
I'm not athletic but I'ma straight balla
The Spud Webb ticket wit' the Lamburg yay
And it's jumpin' from the free throw like MJ
See my faith pass by like Steve that's past
Say, "Boy, you lightnin' fast on the Utah jazz"
Like Dr. J shorts, my work real tight
You got that Atlanta Hawks yay, it won't get right
Catch me on the re-bound like bo outlaw
I'ma Mikey Vicky whip it, cook it souf-paw
36 hoes-zos tryna make the end zone
Make no hard move and use my cell phone
Worth scrabblin' in the pot just like Steve Young
Five for the Keyshawn, seven for the Deion
They call me Chef-Boy-R.G. but I hold dat thought
It's a Kodak moment how I hold dat thought
Got a hurricane wrist game, turn that junk off
Hot as Piggly Wiggly, can't Kermit the frog dog
The Chef-Boy-R.G. but I hold dat thought
It's a Kodak moment how I hold dat thought
Got a hurricane wrist game, turn that junk off
Hot as Piggly Wiggly, can't Kermit the frog dog
Gucci on fiya like mojo crack pot
Fell ova a joint like back like crack rock
Money stupid dumb just like cold blood
Just like young hot, I show no love
Money getta like Cheeba, minds like Fat
And my trap roll hard just like Shawty Black
I'm a country ass nigga just like Ace
Gotta fetish for the stones just like Fo' Trey
Money tall like Broah, yours like D
And my patience's very short just like Courtney C
Angie B, Russell P but it's your choice
My girl angel pussy deep like Slick Man voice
Like Red O3, man, I got bread
My pocket on swole like HP fohead
I'ma money, go, getta so I contest
Gotta a hundred hoes jockin' just like throw back
They call me Chef-Boy-R.G. but I hold dat thought
It's a Kodak moment how I hold dat thought
Got a hurricane wrist game, turn that junk off
Hot as Piggly Wggly, can't Kermit the frog dog
The Chef-Boy-R.G. but I hold dat thought
It's a Kodak moment how I hold dat thought
Got a hurricane wrist game, turn that junk off
Hot as Piggly Wiggly, can't Kermit the frog dog
