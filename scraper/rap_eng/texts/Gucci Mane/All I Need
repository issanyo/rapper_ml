[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Dimitri, Mike and Gucci

[Verse 1: Delaney Jane]
Laying on the front lawn, vibing to the bassdrum
Sipping on a 40
And someone's on the rooftop, lighting up like Snoop Dogg
And it's only Tuesday
And we just wanna unwind from this semi charmed life, baby, baby
I don't need, I don't need nothing else
I don't need, I don't need nothing else

[Chorus: Delaney Jane]
We don't have to wake up 'cause we didn't sleep
I still got a full cup of that Hennessy
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life
5AM and we still feeling reckless
Pile up in the whip getting breakfast
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life

[Post-Chorus: Delaney Jane]
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I just wanna show you how to win, let me coach you
I'm just trying to turn you, baby, turn you to my soldier
Trying to help you prosper, I'm a trail profit
You know they really pocket, they don't really got it
I just wanna see you shop, shop 'til you drop
Pull out with a title, top drop of the lot
She don't want to lead though while she know to not eat
So what the plot thicks
So does Gucci's hard dick

[Chorus: Delaney Jane]
We don't have to wake up 'cause we didn't sleep
I still got a full cup of that Hennessy
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life
5AM and we still feeling reckless
Piled up in the whip getting breakfast
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life

[Post-Chorus: Delaney Jane]
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life

[Bridge: Delaney Jane]
I just wanna have a good time in this semi charmed life, baby, baby
I don't need, I don't need nothing else
I don't need, I don't need nothing else

[Chorus: Delaney Jane]
We don't have to wake up 'cause we didn't sleep
I still got a full cup of that Hennessy
All my friends by my side
It's all I need in my life
5AM and we still feeling reckless
Piled up in the whip getting breakfast
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life
