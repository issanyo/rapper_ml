Bend it over, touch your toes, break that down, let it roll
Bring it up and strike a pose, freak it like you want it though
Baby you's a bad honey, hands-down bad honey
Do it wrong go home, do it right get money
You gotta freak that shit, fr-freak that shit like you want it
You gotta show some ass, show some tits or show some'n!
Just like a marathon, girl just g-g-go on, run it

The way she rock them Apple Bottoms ain't fair (get 'em shawty)
Look, I don't play no games, I don't see she funny
Me, I hang with niggas that get (straight to the money!)
You see, no my name ain't Hova mama but I can throw up a +Roc+
See anybody buy a house, but who can buy that ass the block?
Now I wanna take this time to thank my American Express
