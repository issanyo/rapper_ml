[Hook: Young Thug]
I fell in love
Plus the bottom of her shoes look like she fell in blood
I stay sipping, never slipping, but I fell in mud
Every time I wake up, I be with a different slut
Then I dropped up out of school, soon I fell for drugs
Then I fell off in the club with a couple girls
Then I fell out with my plug, he wasn't keeping up
Stacking hundreds, hit the road, that's the trust fund
Fall for big bank, no ones

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Big bank, all hundreds, pussy nigga, no ones
Pocket scale, real niggas, and a fucking handgun
I'm from Clayton County, we bring shooters, nigga, we don't run
Come through with it from them baggies, now we selling big bumps
Assault rifle 223, we chop you down
No diss songs and retweets, just bodies found
In and out of town, local joker ass nigga
In the club popping Spade by the twenty, nigga
Smoking loud, nigga, popping mollys, nigga
Your dog just went state, not my nigga
But not my niggas
We live by the code, mob ties, nigga

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Man, I fell out with my girl, man, I fell out with that bitch
Get the hell out of this house, ho, gon' and pack your shit
Man, I fell out with the plug and I fell out with my homeboy
Ain't lose sleep about it, tricked out my Jeep about it
If I get ten nigga bleached tonight, better not hear a peep about it
Fell out off in Onyx, at 'bout two-twenty, I'm smoking chronic
Pouring pink tonic, Gucci too turnt, so dropped two Ferraris
My life is a mini movie, every day's a video
Nigga, is you kidding me, cause Gucci Mane got baby choppers
Fall out with my baby mama if she said she ain't fucking with Waka
Versace shades, I see you nigga, I got on these baller glasses
Chicken long way, all my pockets, all my hoes compulsive shoppers

[Hook: Young Thug]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Got them big ol' clips inside of them little guns
No Nelly, got bands on the Air Force, no ones
I'm silly, I got Xan, worked hard, my car
Just made it to me, where I come from ain't far
For you to see a rich, I'm a geek and a monster
She wanna suck these sneakers up, she got hunger
No, no, I could never beat her up, on my momma
But she got more red bottoms than the number one stunna
And that's Baby, I would love to help you start a candy lady
My mom sprayed me with cherry blossoms now I fuck old ladies
And I nut right in them bitches, and have her oh so baby
And also baby
