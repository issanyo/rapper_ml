9:45 and I came back just like Jordan would
His numbers 45 if he’s Jordan sized
Still got the 45 – 45 niggas on line and everybody want a 9 (James Worthy)
George Gervin, Im finger rolling 50 blunts of purp and
I'm jumping out the gym dope Erving
I pulled up servin J’s like Bobby Hurley
Got 42 bricks James Worthy

Most of my tools whip the fours (foe’s)
Yeah the Kobes (24’s) on the jeep and Lebrons on the Rolls
Like the Jordans on the coup 21’s on the front
Make the dope do the Plastic Man Stacey Augmon dunks
Pushin on the chamber pourin like I’m shakin to break ya goals
Just broke a brick down tryna make it back wholes
It’s a sticky situation when you’re cutting dope
Duece on the four when I’m strapped let it go
I owe my whole career to the damn bowl
I need some hoes in this house but I ain’t talkin bout a whole
Dirty talkin bout dope when you swing the dance floor
And I keep money on the floor cus it bring me more flow
I'mma black me some swappy shit nigga I can go
In the bin the hood come part of me she can peel a whole
Call me Robin Hood they know I’m robbin rich out with the poles
Selling white birds and black birds 100 dozen crows
