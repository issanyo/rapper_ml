[Hook]
I made somethin' outta nothing, I didn't have nothing to lose
I came up in the struggle, I had holes all in my shoes
Now my price so cheap that people think my connect from Peru
And my dope so fuckin' good, you can put 4 on a 2
So your deuce turned to six,  so an extra four for you
It's so clean, a Junky's dream, she thinks it's 1982
Jesús pull up, I pull up, then we pop trunks and switcharoo
Got that Tec-9 with the coo
And it might knock you out your shoes, Gucci

[Verse 1]
Back to the wall, back to the mall
Wednesday night, I'm back to Kamal's
Bussin' a blunt so I'm breaking the law
Run up on me and I'm breaking ya' jaw
Flippin' the raw, choppin' the car
Put my red bottles  on top of the bar
I'm dropping my top and she dropping her top
Let my roof back and she took off her bra
I raised these niggas like I was they pa'
Give me respect like I'm fuckin' ya' ma'
Brick Squad Records, you know who we are
Check it, respect it or take me to war
Slap you, dare you to take me to court
Take it in blood but I ain't takin' it short
Ain't gettin' paid then what is the point?
If you want mo' then come fuck with ya' boy
Million in cash, in back of the truck
Take your goons, your dick in the dust
Your hitman be whackin' for us
Got headless bodies in back of the bus
I talk big shit but I'm backin' it up
You stakin' and trappin', ain't trappin' for us?
Think you got us well I'll cut off your nuts and I run them through your body in back of the blood

[Verse 2]
I'm in Sun Valley in a dark alley
Tryna' keep balance in my New Balance
Competitions ain't no challenge, fourteen and I'm so managed
My migo friend but can't speak Spanish
Pressure on but I don't panic
Goin' H.A.M like a ham sandwich
Be calm, I know how to handle it
I vanish in a Vanquish, 50 thousand on these Sam Smith's
Hunnid grand in my pant's, countin' money's romantic
Keep a hunnid, can't handle it, they charge 10 dollars for dances
So I make her dance till' her legs cramp and the bitch said she can't stand me
There's so many fake asses, fuck it, I'mma just smash it
I can't tell if it's fake a or real no more, I think I need glasses
Anti-social, I'mma smoker, so I roll one and don't pass it
Call me Big Unc' when you see me cause I used to give dope to your daddy
