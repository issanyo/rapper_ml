Say you wanna face me
Tell 'em come and scrape me

Say you wanna face me
Tell 'em come and scrape me
Say you wanna face me
Tell 'em come and scrape me

[Verse]
She know a nigga screech, been casin' for a week
We sexin' on the beach and I ain't talkin' 'bout the drink
Open doors for her when I take her out to eat
I'm rollin' up a Sweet while she massage a nigga feet
That shawty so fine, I got a cig and wine
I tell her I don't cheat but she be knowin' a nigga lyin'
Friends can't stand me, they don't understand me
While they hoe hoppin', I got a shotgun in my Aston
Everything is G, [?]
Her bag a couple grand, and it compliments from me
See, I can be the king and she can be my queen
And we can be a scene at the field these others dream
Love the way she talk, love the way she walk
I'm always on her mind and she always in my thoughts
I got her at the house, we blowin' on an ounce
I'm drinkin' down a fourth, tonight we ain't goin' out

[Drop]
Say you wanna face me
Tell 'em come and scrape me
