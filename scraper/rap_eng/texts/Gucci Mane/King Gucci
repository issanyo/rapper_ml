[Intro]
The car named a thing, naw
It’s not the same no more
Shit's better, you know what I’m saying

[Verse 1]
They say my Rolex ain’t the same, boy you changed it?
It ain’t plain jane no more, man you flooding it?
My tour bus ain’t the same as yours cause I gutted mine
I fuck your girl my girl the same time, chump change
Switched my paint up, cause the weather changed
Never switch my lane, keep the change nigga, 20 chain gang
I’m getting some brain in the Range, off the chain with her
I call her lips [?] chain smoking 20 swishers
If them folks come in here now, then I’m not gonna change
I’m not telling names, I can’t change up
I’m not no pitcher nigga, I just change villas
At the currency exchange,Euros-pesos nigga

[Hook]
Pulled up to that light he want the light to change
She riding with you looking at me then that’s a shame
Half a pint and a Sunkist, all change
Cali swag, bars up, Louis belt chain
Pulled up to that light he want the light to change
She riding with you looking at me then that’s a shame
Half a pint and a Sunkist, all change
Cali swag, bars up, Louis belt chain

[Hook]
Pulled up to that light he want the light to change
She riding with you looking at me then that’s a shame
Half a pint and a Sunkist, all change
Cali swag, bars up, Louis belt chain
Pulled up to that light he want the light to change
She riding with you looking at me then that’s a shame
Half a pint and a Sunkist, all change
Cali swag, bars up, Louis belt chain
