[Intro: Quavo]
Yeah
Zaytoven
Young rich nigga shit, Migos 1017

[Chorus: Quavo]
Seen a hundred bands all at one time (I seen it)
I just blew my mama mind 'cause my mama seen it (Fuck)
And she had a fit, yeah she had a fit (Mama)
I told my mama we rich (Rich), told my mama we rich (Go)
Se-seen a hundred bands all at one time (I did)
I just blew my mama mind 'cause my mama seen it (Fuck)
And she had a fit, yeah she had a fit (Mama)
I told my mama we rich (Rich), told my mama we rich (Go)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Mama had a fit when she seen my money (Damn)
She say you got no job, you must be up to something (I know)
Wha-what the hell you doin', don't get in no trouble (What?)
I had to look out for my nephew, he look up to uncle (Takeoff)
Mama got a nigga, I ain't like his ass (Nah)
Try to make me rake the leaves, and cut the grass (What?)
Nigga y'ain't even got no kid, what make you dad? (Nah)
If I wasn't twelve years old, I'd bust your ass (Baww!)
Mama kicked him out and now I'm 21 (She did)
Bought a Prada, Gucci, Louis, Christian Louboutin (True story)
Mama taught everything, I'm her Daniel-san (Mama)
I had to go and get her that Porsche before the summer come (Skrt, gone!)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Seen a hundred bands all at one time (I seen it)
I just blew my mama mind 'cause my mama seen it (Fuck)
And she had a fit, yeah she had a fit (Mama)
I told my mama we rich (Rich), told my mama we rich (Go)
Se-seen a hundred bands all at one time (I did)
I just blew my mama mind 'cause my mama seen it (Fuck)
And she had a fit, yeah she had a fit (Mama)
I told my mama we rich (Rich), told my mama we rich (Go)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I was servin' junkies out my mama window (Mom)
I was worth like half a brick, that was '96 (Huh?)
Daddy gone so I guess that makes me head huncho
Mama rumblin' through my closet she done found a [?]
She say, "I raised you better, boy you got a strong mind"
Said, "I can't believe you serve that to your own kind"
Told my mama, "Shit," 'cause I been broke a long time
That's why I'm at the store and junkies in a lone line
I was a runner from my bother, I need my own plug
I feel like 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne, I need my own drugs
First time I set shop on my own block, I didn't get no love
Two-thousand for a Charger, six, its no scrub

[Chorus: Quavo]
Seen a hundred bands all at one time (I seen it)
I just blew my mama mind 'cause my mama seen it (Fuck)
And she had a fit, yeah she had a fit (Mama)
I told my mama we rich (Rich), told my mama we rich (Go)
Se-seen a hundred bands all at one time (I did)
I just blew my mama mind 'cause my mama seen it (Fuck)
And she had a fit, yeah she had a fit (Mama)
I told my mama we rich (Rich), told my mama we rich (Go)

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
The Audi, the Masi, the Jag, war
The Bentley, the house by the lake
Gold on my neck, gold on my wrist
Young Takeoff, I shit on ten K
I'm posted with Guwop
I'm strapped up with two Glocks
Versace my back
I feel like I'm 2Pac
He wanted whole brick
I gave him re-rock
Pull up on your block
[?] T-Top
Finesse the plug for the bags
My wrist is spinnin' like Taz
I know that my mama 'gon spaz
She find out 'bout all of this cash
But fuck it, my nigga, we rich
Remember them nights and them licks
Duckin' police and jumpin' the fence
Now we in Lambs, president tint

[Chorus: Quavo]
Seen a hundred bands all at one time (I seen it)
I just blew my mama mind 'cause my mama seen it (Fuck)
And she had a fit, yeah she had a fit (Mama)
I told my mama we rich (Rich), told my mama we rich (Go)
