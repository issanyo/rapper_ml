[Verse 1: Stash]
I feel I'm gonna lose my mind, woah
I am talking with you, woah
Can you tell me the truth, hey
Our words are turning into knives
I know that I blame it on you
But all I wanted was you

[Pre-Chorus: Stash]
And I know, I know
That when you pull me close
I lose control, control
Above the things I do
You know, you know
You messed up the meaning of it all, it all
Whenever I'm in love

[Chorus: Stash]
What happened last night?
Why don't you just tell me
What happened last night?
Why don't you just tell me
What happened last night?

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I woke up in a bed with a baddy (ugh)
The only thing I know is that she had a fatty (damn)
I went hard last night
I swear they treated Gucci like a god last night (Gucci)
I'm in Italy with your broad last night
Got her late, man official a job last night (sorry)
Yeah, we all in Europe
With ten Italian girls and they all on syrup
And they all bi-curious
Pull up in a Lamb', so fast so furious
Baby girl I'm serious
Went to Italy but woke up in Paris

[Pre-Chorus: Stash]
And I know, I know
That when you pull me close
I lose control, control
Above the things I do
You know, you know
You messed up the meaning of it all, it all
Whenever I'm in love

[Chorus: Stash]
What happened last night?
Why don't you just tell me
What happened last night?
Why don't you just tell me
What happened last night?
