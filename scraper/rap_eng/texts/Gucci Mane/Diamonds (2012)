[Chorus: Jeremih]
I got more diamonds
And they go shinin'
I got my ice around me
Uuuuuuuh yea yea yea yea
I got those diamonds
They go shinin'
I got my ice around me
Uuuuuuuh yea yea yea yea

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
Bitches say I'm photogenic, diamonds dancing on my pendant
Stirrin' like I’m cooking spinach, this gon take like 20 minutes
Ain’t got time so let it out, I'm the nigga that you read about
Beat the type of you pussy niggas I hate these lames a whole lot
I was taught not leave witness, every day I'm handling business
Pulling up in big old Benzes, yea my rims are real expensive
Just one verse but I said a lot
Rich Squad boys get bread a lot
Sit it out, or bring the titties out
Laid the top back in the city light

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I got more diamonds
And they go shinin'
I got my ice around me
Uuuuuuuh yea yea yea yea
I got those diamonds
They go shinin'
I got my ice around me
Uuuuuuuh yea yea yea yea

[Verse 2 - Future]
I’m did up like a light pole, I step out of my light show
I don't have to grab the mic, I step out then my ears glow
I'm a walkin' crystal ball, got a sack full of money like Santa Claus
I play so much that codeine, I don't ever had no withdraw
My girls come to my show, they come to my show, they don't have all clothes on
Got devious and trippin', all my niggs are like a waterfall
All sparklin' on my wrist you know my ears don't when I answer call
You've got diamonds in your face, it ain't no mistake, hey girl I gotta ball

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I got more diamonds
And they go shinin'
I got my ice around me
Uuuuuuuh yea yea yea yea
I got those diamonds
They go shinin'
I got my ice around me
Uuuuuuuh yea yea yea yea

[Verse 3 - Jeremih]
My diamonds came from hustling (hustling)
So everyday I'm hustling, hustling, so what
Never been a D boy but now I got my dough up
Hey girl I'm a boss cause my dough up
And the bitches callin' them doughnuts
Cruisin' through the hundreds in a 2 door
Diamonds shinin’ these here look like blue balls
One chain, I need two more
Too high I'm on Pluto
Bitch money pockets gone sumo
It Friday night, yea you know

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I got more diamonds
And they go shinin'
I got my ice around me
Uuuuuuuh yea yea yea yea
I got those diamonds
They go shinin'
I got my ice around me
Uuuuuuuh yea yea yea yea
