[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm in the kitchen whippin babies like I'm Joe jackson
I feel like lauren hill cause I dont like to pay taxes
My dope so good it make think she look like janet jackson, letoya jackson, or tony braxton
Center of attention diamonds dance like Michael Jackson
26s forgys moonwalk on my bently wagon
I think I'm michael 1999, I pull up cameras flashing
And i just got my dick sucked from the daughter of Elvis Presly
Pouring lean in pepsi Michael jackson naked
And I'm so dope I going solo now Tito jealous
And I want all the drugs to myself they say I'm selfish
Got my own pharmacy and my own doctor I need my fuckin' medicine

[Verse 2: Figg Panamera]

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Gucci Mane]
Smooth talker, moon walker Christian Loui's my shoes got her
Oops my jewels got her, they say you the preachers daughter
Pussy smells like water got me talkin like I'm muddy waters
I'm in the place so tell me where to go I'm on that Molly water
Forgiatos body kit yeah thats a check talking
And the way the rims set, look like they moonwalking
And when I come down the set, look like I'm crip-crawlin'
So many straight A's like I hit a lick/Ballerina tip toein
Michael jackson on my neck, these diamonds moonwalking
Michael jackson concert, i got white women falling
Michael jackson, Michael Jordan's exclusive really important
Like Michael jackson ain't worth a fortune, I just lost all my endorsements

[Hook]
