[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'mma keep dropping verses
Hotter than the hottest summer
Eat rappers like Jeffrey Dahmer
Dope color Sinead O'Connor
Should I name another one
Unless you like President Obama
Wanna buy two extra commas?
All my shoes are Ferragamo
Lightning actually hear the thunder
Even Stevie Wonder wonder
Why yo baby mama call so much I had to change my number
Sarcasm, these bitches need to ride or ride past him
I wouldn't even give that bitch an orgasm
Miraculously my niggas stand beside and not in back of me
So disrespect my faculty, how dare you have audacity
The club packed to capacity, I cash out automatically
I spit these rhymes so radically, sporadically, fatality

[Chorus: OJ Da Juiceman & Gucci Mane]
I got the green, drank, pills, blow
Runnin round the town gettin money I suppose
I'm the gingerbread man (X4)
I got the green, drank, pills, blow
I can't get no sleep, just keep knockin' on my door
I'm the gingerbread man (X4)

[Verse 2: OJ Juice Man]
Gingerbread Man, i got white, I got white
Trap house bunkin up all night, take flight
Droppin 10 bases? its jumpin that white?
Trees to that paper so im something like a kite
Loud stanky kush and it tellin me to light
Extra loud diamonds and its lookin like a light
Roller skatin' money and my pockets just glide
Everday diamonds kuz they dont like to hide
Vvs light yea so you block yo eyes
Burnt color diamonds like a sweet potato pie
Hit ya color diamonds??? and get ratchet like a fly?
The brick man, the bread man I don't tell no lies

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I'm the man to get it in
I am on it and I go in
I am comfortable settin' a trend
I get bored and do it again
If I ever crossed a genie
I would ask her for a twin
Cuz the number time of paper
Cost me to gather up my ends
It's ???
AM and I'm drinking gin
I could act like we are friends
But I don't like to pretend
I got 30 stacks, need Ajax
Got your future price on my AmEx
I'm addicted to ballin'
I hear ??? and relapse
You SlimFast to bankroll
My stash gettin way too fat
No push ups, just cook ups
I'm booked up, I do one lap
There's ??? mayne and ??? mayne
And ??? mayne and I'm brick mayne
Got ??? all in my kitchen
So my house smell like cocaine

[Chorus]
