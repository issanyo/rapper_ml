[Hook: Gucci Mane]
With the bomboclats my trap-spot, dreadlocks and rastas, rude boys and rude girls
Jamaican mobsters, I shot the sheriff, smoking bob marley, all of this ecstacy is killing me softly
Turgo and curry, mid grade so pretty, this spots my x spot, can't dodge the red dot, smoking the lala
Can't get no higher, where is me iya? she sends me fire, where is me lighter, look at me ice-uh
Step up your neckpiece, I like your wife-uh, I pack a rifle, I love me life-uh
Put up your hands before, I put up my rifle

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
What's up nigga wut it do, I'm good my nigga how are you, half a chicken, whole chicken, quarter chicken
What it move? Bentley coupe on bentley shoes, hell na them ain't 22's, still keep coke in inner tubes
Plotting on my next buissness move, 26 inch tennis shoes, old school paint it maserati blue
Brought my gun, but forgot my roof, pulling up with your baby boo, ooh ooh it's you know who
It's nascar baby what you gonna do, looking for something thick I can screw, paint change
And my diamonds too, trap nigga watch reminding you, my grill and ring be blinding you
If you a stubborn artist I'm signing you, I'm still the same nigga that be shining too, Trap nigga, watch reminding you, my grill and ring be blinding you
If you a stubborn artist I'm signing you, I'm still the black nigga that be shining too bitch
