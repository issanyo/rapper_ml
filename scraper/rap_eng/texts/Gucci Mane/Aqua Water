Tha Joker:
Extraordinary, 'strodinary super-duper Joker, damn
Silly ass stupid fucking chain its a disgrace
A fresh taste like my expiration date never
A yellow face, like I drug tested on my bezel.
We clever Street niggas in the club moving hella weight
We buy the bar tonight as if we bought the weights just yesterday
J-Too-Cold, I'm wrecking things; you pussy niggas flexing, mane
It's Joker, Mr. F.T.E, im with So Icey e.n.t

(chorus):
Diamonds hella yellow, fellow
Mellow, yellow diamond bezel
Aqau water, toilet water, pissy yellow, shitting on 'em
Club life, club night. Shawty gotta hella chain
Hella game, hella fame, Drop top Corvette, yellow paint

[Gucci Mane:]
Yeah, I'm on the watch, chain, earring and ring shit
Hangin with the dope boys, cause they on the same shit
Blues got her seasick, shorty think she seein things
Bart iced out on a skateboard, and he skating, man
Nope, these 180, mane, got these rappers hatin mane
Got it fo' Atlanta mane, brought it out my trappin game
Whole lot of traffic mane, bein mojo, stackin change
Tattoo of that yellow ring, shorty got a yellow chain

(chorus 2x):

Tha Joker:
Aqua water, toilet water, that's just how the chain sound
It go real hard like Michael Jackson on a playground
Joker on that fruity fruit. Them pussies, they be hatin'
We make 'em scramble like chicken babies
Crazy, black Glock, black tee. Diamonds hella yellow
Put them shells on his back now they call him Donatello
If you go to meet yo' pluck, and you catch him on the pay phone
He work for 5-0 just like Tony Yayo
Kush by the caseload, that's how we get the payload
Them diamonds real pissy like the stall of a racehorse
These thirsty hoes straight po', my wristt look like a faygo
It's Joker-Too-Cold, foreign diamonds got em hollering fuego cause da...

(chorus 3x)
