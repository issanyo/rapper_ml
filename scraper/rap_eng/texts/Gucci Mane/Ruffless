Searching for the bad bitches
Smoking on a hope, start cross the long way
Then blow it like a zuca
Load and pass about the road way
Come and pass for friend Luca
Don’t get caught on the road talking
Fuck her banded ruffless
Spend on, fuck on, spend again your ruffless
Turn in fuck up in their ruffles
Truth fucks up in their ruffles
Fuck up in their ruffles
Downs in my pant came on to my Louie trip
I will catch no jail work, all they play you can afford
How’s magagy gain for
For you trapping then you suspect
Ball on my line cuz you ball on and on
Turn up what the fuck you mean
Time to go on time and get …ya all let it go
Lay it on the …caught that roaf pop pop
Send my truth shut shut get lose
Searching for a cause how will all succeed
Uuh go maley and blow free bones
...should maley on the air and stuck as coped
Stuck fronting, and fucking for the groupers do
Jording beating like a beast and they grope as dope
You all do it like you wre some boss
Certainly for it you can do the trick five
Cool for the load, now cool for the bone
Right G stop beat no religion getting for
Try fight, Louie stand on the blow
Say it’s full of bad bitches smoking on a hopa
Lord don’t pass me from the load call your ex friend luca
Don’t get caught on the road talking
Fuck her banded ruffless
Spend on, fuck on, spend again your ruffless
Turn in fuck up in their ruffles
Truth fucks up in their ruffles
Fuck up in their ruffles
Get more tag when you thought your nigga learn
If it ain’t bout no money then you really not concern
Cush is my colone I keep call anybody getting burn
Drop stick spin and weapon …spending like so much more
Me and my nigga neighbor will see you
Stay with this whore
Will make this easy, full on that table high on disease
Play with that cash
We stop now from breathing, we smoke the gas and all the hook
Self employ not security on my own shutter, stops in my head boy
From all the bitch…landing in the airport
Young nigga tolding the rugas
While I take the rufless shut you for get you like ruffless
In Vegas they find me on roof top
With groopies that make now a movement
Say it’s full of bad bitches smoking on a hopa
Lord don’t pass me from the load call your ex friend luca
Don’t get caught on the road talking
Fuck her banded ruffless
Spend on, fuck on, spend again your ruffless
Turn in fuck up in their ruffles
Truth fucks up in their ruffles
Fuck up in their ruffles
