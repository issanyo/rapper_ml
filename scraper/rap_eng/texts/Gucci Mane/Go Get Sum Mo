[Chorus: Young Dolph & Ty Dolla $ign]
This water on me got my neck froze
Coupe with the suicide doors
And I love all of my hoes
Yeah, I love all of my hoes, ayy
She cookin' breakfast with no clothes
I'm some' like a pimp, that's for sure
I spend it and go get some more
Yeah, I spend it and go get some more
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
In somethin' foreign going 200, I might go shopping in London
I spend it and go get some more
Yeah, I spend it and go get some more

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Spent some more money, beat another case
Riding down eleven like Scarface
Sixty thousand dollar tuxedo
These bitches just love a nigga's lingo
Little bitty nigga with a real big ego
Three bank accounts with a whole lot of zeros
Lil nigga I'm Michael, you Tito
I dress like I been selling kilos
I put my side bitch in a Benz
Just so she can flex on her friends
I used to sell dope out my mama's house
Then had all the money at grandma's house
I go on Rodeo, fuck up a check
Smokin' blunts and eating percocets
Still with them niggas I came up with
I can never ever trust a bitch
Addition and multiplication
We runnin' this money up daily
Smashing Instagram sensations
For bullshit I got no patience
I jump out, I jump out, I jump out
The back of the Phantom rockin' all this ice
I want it, I want it, I want it
I get it, I don't give a fuck what the price

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Young Dolph]
Water on my neck got me froze
Coupe got the suicide doors, yeah
Ain't savin' these hoes, yeah
No I ain't savin' these hoes
She cookin' breakfast with no clothes, yeah
I'm somethin' like a pimp, that's for sure, yeah
Spend it and go get some more, yeah
Spend it and go get some more
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
In somethin' foreign going 200, I might go shopping in London
I spend it and go get some more
Yeah, I spend it and go get some more

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
This rap shit too easy, my left wrist too freezy
She butt naked in the kitchen cookin' breakfast, eggs over easy
I'm the king but I don't play for Cleveland
I'm feeling just like the weed man
When he got the hundred keys in
So strong, can't breathe in
Bitch better have my guala
Looking like I sell narcota
Ballin' like I hit the lotto
And the devil still wears Prada, it's Gucci
Money over hoes my motto
How you bad but you don't swallow
If I front you my product
Then you better have my dollars, Gucci
Scratch front like I'm Pimp C
Big hustle like Nipsey
Blue Benz, my crip B
12 sitting on Forgis
And your wife she choosing
Better get a divorce then
I want to buy charges not forcement
She wish she had an abortion

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Young Dolph]
Water on my neck got me froze
Coupe got the suicide doors, yeah
Ain't savin' these hoes, yeah
No I ain't savin' these hoes
She cookin' breakfast with no clothes, yeah
I'm somethin' like a pimp, that's for sure, yeah
Spend it and go get some more, yeah
Spend it and go get some more
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
In somethin' foreign going 200, I might go shopping in London
I spend it and go get some more
Yeah, I spend it and go get some more

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Thank god for my mama not using a condom
Wear Dolce Gabannas like they are pajamas
It's deuce gadanas, I hang with the hunters
And runners and killers and dealers, one hundred
Every year I buy a new vehicle
Throw the girl out like a flea flicker
I don't even dodge them cheap liquors
I got so high I tried to eat people
Jewelry on drippin' like a sea creature
Money so tall I don't see people
Weed so loud, can't keep secret
Y'all been plottin', I been peepin'
Y'all been talkin', I been thinkin'
I been growin', y'all been shrinkin'
Big diamond on my lil pinky
Too much sauce, I done started leaking
I got more bars than precincts
I got more cars than Reese's, uh uh
I got more heart than niggas
Put that on God my nigga, uh uh
Ain't tryna starve my nigga
They tryna scar a nigga
I told 'em nah my nigga
I'm the godfather nigga
Make me Brett Favre a nigga

[Chorus: Young Dolph & Ty Dolla $ign]
This water on me got my neck froze
Coupe with the suicide doors
And I love all of my hoes
Yeah, I love all of my hoes, ayy
She cookin' breakfast with no clothes
I'm some' like a pimp, that's for sure
I spend it and go get some more
Yeah, I spend it and go get some more
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
In somethin' foreign going 200, I might go shopping in London
I spend it and go get some more
Yeah, I spend it and go get some more
