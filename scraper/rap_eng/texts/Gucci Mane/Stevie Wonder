[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
They say money is the root of evil
I say money is the reason why I'm so rude to people
Ten women on a date and I'm treating nigga
I gotta say my grace I'm eating on you pussy niggas
Uh, I got more money then a principle
I graduated from the streets now I'm invisible
Everybody wanna be me cause they can't see me
Everybody wanna join cause they can't beat me
They say my swag get sick and I need treatment
And these niggas can't see me like a young Stevie
I brought my Ray Charles locs and that good smoke
I went to straight to the top but he went broke

[Hook]
Stevie Wonder, Stevie Wonder
Black shades, I can't see you, Stevie Wonder
Stevie Wonder, Stevie Wonder
I'm a living legend just like Stevie Wonder
Stevie Wonder, Stevie Wonder
Diamonds sticking on my wrist just like Stevie Wonder
Stevie Wonder, Stevie Wonder
You niggas never see me y'all like Stevie Wonder

[Verse 2 - Future]
Stevie Stevie please believe me
You gon never see me
I got more ammo than Gilbert Arenas
I'm hydro leaning
Astronomical
Check the chronicles
Paul McCartney
My shades the darkest
I can't see no artist
Salute the sergeant
I got a broader horizon
While you continue starving
My closet like four garages
Im G5 classified
An i got your baby mama so mesmorized
She done sucked the kid off several times
And still ain't seen my eyes
Im so in Pluto
I dont walk cause i just float
Rolling like on a boat
And i can play the piano
I counted so many Euros
I had to get a translator for my bitch cause she dont speak no englo
Church!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane]
I beat another case I feel like Gotti did
I was born in the mob I feel like Gotti kids
My ice killed the club get a body bag
And I ain't talking luggage but I gotta lot of bags
Stupid, stupid swag on 'em
Crazy, crazy cash on 'em
Shit is gettin' contagious money might just have a rash on it
It's Guwop in that new drop
And I'm coming back like 2Pac
You niggas don't see me like a blind man
I forgot the time about two clock
First day I came home I been going, going gone
Walking around bumping everybody
Cause I can't see I just hear about it
Live a crazy life and you can read about it
That 4-5 I can't leave without it
I need black shades I can't see without it
If you talk about it then be about it

[Hook]
