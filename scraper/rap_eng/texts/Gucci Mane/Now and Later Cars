We got Now and Later cars, Froot Loop chains
Stupid fruity colors in our pinky rings
We got Now and Later cars, Froot Loop chains
Stupid fruity colors in our pinky rings

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
One is for the money and two is for the show
Three is for the ice that got me gliding on the floor
With stupid fruity colors, got me sliding in your hoe
I'm hopping out a Coupe with them swanga Lambo doors
Cadillac Escalade on them [?]
Two days out the week, I be cruising on a boat
With a Cuban plug and yes, I'm selling coke
Jewelry so sick that it'll keep me with a cold
Call me "Baby Beemer" 'cause I'm plugged with that dope
Or better yet, "Krispy Kreme", I'm posted with them O's
[?] on my feet, first album going gold
A real trapstar and I get it out the bowl
Young Juiceman with a swagger more than gold
They keep them damn groupies bobbing and jigging on they toes
Blue, black, yellow diamonds keep the Juice froze
And two-tone Charger sitting up on 24's

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci, nah ming
Crayola colored cars because I love to be seen
Purple thrax box Chevy, same color lean
My rims 26, but my bricks nineteen
Off white clear coat, same color Chlorine
Gold Catalina, same color Listerine
Your friend say she seen me in my Lamborghini
Blue, same color as the diamonds in my pinky
SpongeBob Charger, Elmo Sliverado
Alligator Acura, crocodile Tahoe
Two-door Chevelle, but these rims like a Lamb
And it urrt with a skrrt, got a cab and a Lamb

[Verse 3: OJ da Juiceman]
Lucky Charm Chevy, cam kit ready
Lift up off the ground, you can call me Young Petty
Dale Earnhardt, that's my first cousin, cuz
Box Caprice looking like Fruitopia
Neck game ready, pinky ring heavy
Chop your ass up, eat your ass like spaghetti
Out-the-trunk shopping, hell yeah, that shit petty
I'ma go to Phipps Plaza, spending all that fetty
Call me Young Juice or Swagger Right Shawty
'Cause you know I'm posted with them yams and Glock .40
Or call me Sick Wid It, owed by E-40
I just bought a new car, owned by Harley
In Benihana, eating up that fucking shark meat
Swordfish white meat, you know I'm on them [?]
Star diamond earrings and the color is loud pink
[?] so hard, can't get your hoe off from around me
