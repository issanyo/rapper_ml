Hook:
Scandalous ass bitch trying to take to a league
But you won't let her see that shit, nope
I ain't fi'n make you rich, naw
What you eat don't make me shit, bow
I ain't fi'n to spare dat bitch, huh?
I ain't fi'n to spare dat bitch, damn!
I ain't fi'n to spare dat bitch, huh?
I ain't fi'n to spare dat bitch, nope

Figg in da mirror, do it in a bless way
Way 200 on a dash, 100 on express way
Jordan on my feet, shirt on my best day
Post season projects, heavy on my chest play
Thinking I'mma go get it undercover hitter
Heavy on the plot for the sucka in the middle
Finger in her cookies, man I'm fucking with a rooky
Looking at his foot print, hit him when he's looking
Whole neighborhood man waiting for the cookie
Certify rat man, Feds can't book'em
Streets can't catch'em now he claimin' dat ?
But they caught em in the shine ask where the streets took'em

[Hook]

You a scandalous ass bitch tryin' to turn me to a lick
But you won't let her see that shit, naw
Bet you regret that shit
Can't finesse disrespect my clique
I'm a lunatic, but my goon is really sick
They'll cut you up in pieces bitch
Well nieces and nephews, bitch
Tell you watch you better bring them grips, yeah
And a hard-top Lamb, and a drop-top M
And a hard-top Rari with bitch, yeah
Tell J to clean that shit, yeah
Say it like I mean that shit, yeah
