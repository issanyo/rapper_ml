If you act up in the club
Then you knoe we throwin hollows

My wrist inside the club is like a highlighted marker
On beats I'm a monster

This Mary Jane got on the war like nina parker

Tell him bring the choppa (blat)
Fuck Cee in the Dr

My car my gurls love to wear skirts
Paint color look like dirt
No shirts in that 08' Vert

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]

Sixty-one deep
No shirt no top (go)
White chain bright lane
VVS white rocks blow
I'm a work of art, mane
I'll crush your ice game
Thousand dollars lite mane
Need to rob a dice game
Tatted like a white man
Party like a rock band
The so icy bike game
Makin lames tuck chains
Goddamn, Gucci Mane
You done did that shit again
Goin knee deep in the earth so that you can have a chain
My body wrote on like an ese
But homie no Mexican
So icy entertainment
You can write it on me mane
In the center of the stage with no tank top (no no)
For the block I'm showin every tattoo I got (yea)
