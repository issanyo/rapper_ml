[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

This Rollie here nothing but 40 pointers
Shoot no three's just a bunch of jumpers
40 day 40 night nigga nothin' but water
This neckpiece cost me one and a quarter
Your bitch to me is like a nick to me
And a brick to me is like a nick to me
20 bags of OG got a bell on me
Three bricks got a whole hotel on me
Devil in a red dress cooking deuces up in Prada shoes
Baby girl my tight end catch a bone just like a [?]
Guwop man I'm upper echelon and I got higher goals
Black tycoon with more stock in the city than Ted Turner do
FTW, WCW [?]
Zone 6 governor standing on top of ya
Gucci [?]
Gucci gotta check out my czechoslovakia
Landed the [?] and I know that I'm popular
Grab you and rob you and check our your Nautica and If you don't talk I'll beam the shit out of ya

[Chorus: Money Man]
Pull up on you put a stick in ya face
Pull up on you put a brick in ya face
Roll up that pressure then go up to space
They not a hunnid so we don't relate
I sip dat purple dat muddy muddy
Just had the foreign hand washed by a junkie
Faithfully I go and get me some money
You not a boss you a mf flunkie
Break down a bale and then sweep up the shake
Serve u a pound out a motherfuckin' Wraith
Light up dat pressure then go up to space
Pop me a seal then drank up an 8
Break down a bale and then sweep up the shake
Serve u a pound out a mf Wraith
Light up dat pressure then go up to space
Pop me a seal then drank up an 8

[Verse 1: Money Man]
Pop me a perk and then go up to Jupiter
I send a goon to come motherfuckin' shoot at cha
Serve u a p in a cutlass on forgis
My condo sittin on 38 stories
Break down a bale then sweep up a zip
Serve u a brick out a Wraith and then dip
Roll up da pressure then pass it to Gucci
They say the bitch I'm wit favor Karrueche
Po up a 8 of the muddy then stumble
Catch me a play like I came out a huddle
Moneyman Tarzan I hang in the jungle
Nothin but blue hunnids fill up my bundle
Sometimes I feel like the world on my shoulders
Fly to the west and den meet wit a grower
I got dat purple diluting my soda
Ride wit my troops imma boss & a soldier
This is a warning don't play wit a hooligan
Bust at u reload then we gon shoot again
Feds done got hipped so we pick up and move again
That nigga fake I don't want shit to do wit him
Reup in Denver then drive to Atlanta
They smell this pack that I got in Savannah
They smell this pack that I got in New York
BC some niggas u cannot extort

[Chorus: Money Man]
Pull up on you put a stick in ya face
Pull up on you out a brick in ya face
Roll up that pressure then go up to space
They not a hunnid so we don't relate
I sip dat purple dat muddy muddy
Just had the foreign hand washed by a junkie
Faithfully I go and get me some money
You not a boss you a mf flunkie
Break down a bale and then sweep up the shake
Serve u a pound out a mf Wraith
Light up dat pressure then go up to space
Pop me a seal then drank up an 8th
Break down a bale and then sweep up the shake
Serve u a pound out a mf Wraith
Light up dat pressure then go up to space
Pop me a seal then drank up an 8th
