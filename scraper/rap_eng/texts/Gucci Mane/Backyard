[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Got so tough for a rainy day
Got money stashed in my momma's backyard
Got a bag of money hid away
I Got it stashed in my momma's backyard
A nigga play with my money he ain't here today
The nigga dead in my momma backyard
Can't forget the plays that I hid in the safe
I got stashed in my momma's backyard
Been a player with the pay yeah
Started with a baby
Trap going crazy do a 100 k a day yeah

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm a survivor, race car driver
Im drinking on mollies mixed with tranquilizers
I shoot at my rivals
I race for your title
I'm the African-American idol
Your bitch on powder, a good dick rider
She sucked it all night then cooked the eggs sunny-side up
Been gambling 2 days, poker money done piled up
Hold extended clips like the police allow us
No I.O.U.s I don't fuck with them vowels
I'm sweatin backstage I'm in need of a towel
Me and Lil Wayne been up 72 hours
Remember how when I was broke I used to wish of a prowler
My jewels so cold that my ring drew a crowd up
I told her when she suck my dick to do the shit louder
My mouth too foul and it need to get milder
My verse is killing yours, imagination more wilder
Deep dish rim I can fit in a child
Pedophile dope, price is 14 5's
And the dope so good it'll bring you some power
50 bags are OG I don't fuck with the sour

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
My bitch bad, my money long
My weed loud, my team strong
I ain't rolling up unless it's strong
My ice bright, Your bitch nice
That's why I invited her to spend the night
My Glock black and my coupe too
I drive these bitches coocoo
I ain't never ever ever love these hoes
I just wanna smoke my weed and sell my dope
Count six figures take care of my folk
They say I leave a loud smell everywhere I go
Nigga fuck with Gucci I seeing my little nigga to cut off his leg
Nigga snitch on daddy yo, you gots to get one in the head
All of my niggas from the gutter
I love to fuck her but I don't love her
All of my niggas tote big straps, too fresh
We ain't got time for no tussles
I put that on everything I love
Rule number one nigga show no love
My cuz was a crip, my plug was a blood
Everything I got, I got it out the mud
