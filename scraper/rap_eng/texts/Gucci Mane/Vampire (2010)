[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Do you believe in vampires?
I believe in vampires
Now shawty stay up all night
Try to build an empire
Black Ferrari is a vampire campfire
Pull up in the club, got a dub of da brick fare

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Vampire onstage, black shades
Vampire, vampire, black fur, red floor [?]
I put my left foot first then I make them say burrrr
She's a vampire, you's a tramp signer
You's a cent for a pimp, you been temp, loser
I'm a vamp, hit the hamp, cop a dub, hit the club
Glue 'em on tight, hold 'em right
I'ma thug, bitches love, she's a vampire, she's a cum finder
Every mamma in the hood wanna get behind her
She's so fine, she's so white, think I wanna sign her
She ain't gotta sneak around, she'll shop and smoke purp (purr)
I'm a vamp, hit the cris, cop a [?] stress

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Do you believe in vampires?
I believe in vampires
Shawty stay up all night try to build an empire
Black Ferrari is a vampire campfire
Pull up to the club, got a dub, brick fare
Rims cost brick fare, chicks cost zip fare, Mr. Zone 6
Pretty bitches comin' wit flare, vampire, vampire
Club full of vampires, vampire, vampire, suck me like a vampire

[Verse 2: Trina]
Gucci, do me, throw me in the movie
When you see me you salute, true blood (oh-wee)
Suck 'em like a leech, make em chew me
If it ain't about the money, ain't no talkin' to me
Giddy up horsey, panorama porsey, I am not remorse-y, I eat a dinner corsey
No, he fuckin' wit the right bitch, right [?] soft lips
[?] light salt, all them vinegar chips, my night shift
The only bad bitch sting like a cactus
These hoes is actress, I'm Mary Magdalene
Ya I'm body baggin', no more relaxin', I'm bitin' necks, full moon eclipse

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Do you believe in vampires?
I believe in vampires
Shawty stay up all night try to build an empire
Black Ferrari is a vampire campfire
Pull up to the club, got a dub, brick fare
Rims cost brick fare, chicks cost zip fare, Mr. Zone 6
Pretty bitches comin' wit flare, vampire, vampire
Club full of vampires, vampire, vampire, suck me like a vampire

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Step inside in my vampire ride
It's a yellow lam tam, steerin' wheelie on other side
She called me ten times, need to let that shit ride
If her old man catch her man, I let that bitch slide
My hood to 6, headin' up to west side
Vampires outside, they be trappin' all night
[?] wrap, it's a wrap
I am just another nigga from the trap, wit a scrap on my lap Just in case dirty rats, filthy pigs, stupid fuck, you's a vampire
Tell these snitches to suck it, tryna suck up information, probably work for the force
Where you at filthy pig? I'm not a duck stupid fuck

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Do you believe in vampires?
I believe in vampires
Shawty stay up all night try to build an empire
Black Ferrari is a vampire campfire
Pull up to the club, got a dub, brick fare
Rims cost brick fare, chicks cost zip fare, Mr. Zone 6
Pretty bitches comin' wit flare, vampire, vampire
Club full of vampires, vampire, vampire, suck me like a vampire
