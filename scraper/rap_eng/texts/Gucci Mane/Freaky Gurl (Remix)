[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky gurl
Don't bring her to mama
First you get her name
Then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
She's a very freaky gurl
Don't bring her to mama
First you get her name
Then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci can't ding a ling, bet I make your back hurt
Bet I make your cat squirt, bet I make your neck jerk
Call Lil Kim told her better wear a tight skirt
Bet I know your tight work, bet I make ya cum first
Gucci Mane (yeah), bet we make a sex tape
Flood it on the internet, put it on my Myspace
Gucci got a big stick, make ya sing my ad libs (yeah)
But you gotta be a queen bitch, Gucci
So icy trap star, fuck her like a porn star
First my H2, then I fucked her in her own car
Face down, ass up, I'ma make her love me
Probably don't love me but let her suck and fuck me
Gucci wanna sex ya, tell me is it itched ya
Probably could a hit it dawg, I ain't even hit it yet
Fuck the 20 minutes dawg, I ain't even nutted yet
Now she braggin' on me dawg, I ain't even stuntin' it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky gurl
Don't bring her to mama
First you get her name
Then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

[Verse 2: Lil Kim]
I'm a very freaky gurl
Very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl
Very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl
Very freaky gurl, gurl

Ohh
You want a freaky gurl?
Welcome to Kim's World
You ain't gon' wanna leave
Just like a kid at Disney World
My deep throat have you squirtin' like a watergun
Coochie overflowin' like somebody let the faucet run
Bust one nut, I ain't done, I got more to come
Friends? Tell' em all to come, we gon' have some mo' fun
Yeaaaah
Chew on me like some bubblegum
I'll lick you like a lollipop
Once you taste my honeybun
It's our lil secret
Just like my underwear
You know pain is pleasure
Can you make me shed a tear?
Smack my ass, grab my neck
Got 'em cummin' everywhere
I'ma freak so I don't care
Just don't get none in my hair
Now he callin' me wifey
And he wanna introduce me
Takin' me on shoppin' sprees
He wanna buy me Gucci
Zoomin' like a blue sea
On the back of his Suzuki
And I ain't even sex 'em
All I did was let him eat my.... coochie! (hahaha okay, it's Gucci)
Lil Kim

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky gurl
Don't bring her to mama
First you get her name
Then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I got some brain 'n the front seat of the hummer
And if you can make it rain, then Ludacris can make it thunder
I ain't messin' with these lames but it seem I make them wonder
How I came and took the game for the past seven summers
Now yo' woman wanna get it from the front (from the front), from the back (from the back)
And if she with it, I'ma hit it from the side
Give her what she want (she want), in the lack (in the lack) She a freak gurl and I can see it in her eyes
She can go tit (go tit), for tat (for tat), it's so good that I made her wanna cry
A little bit of this (little bit of this), little that for two piece biscuit and sum fries
Straight from churches, ya boyfriends' worthless
Cause Luda' go deep while he barely scratch the surface
She itching for a scratch like she DJ JC
If u looking fo' ya match, bitch come and find me
I be in the A town, I ain't that hard to find
Put ya legs up in the air and see the DTP sign
If ya wanna meet my mama, that's a thing I won't do
You say muthafuck me, nah muthafuck you, kno' why

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky gurl
Don't bring her to mama
First you get her name
Then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

[Outro: Lil Kim]
I'm a very freaky gurl
Very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl
Very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl
Very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl
Very freaky gurl, gurl
Ohh
