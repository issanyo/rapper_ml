[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
God too many bitches call and gotta keep it on the charger
Nigga keep on hatin'; imma load up my revolver
6's: they want 50, that's why I put them on the charger
Take these rappers to the hood like a fish out the water
(niggas never cross because Gucci a double crosser)
Used to run some valium just like me know at Tha Carter
A street nigga turned industry that's where the nigga lost me
Hold my rollie up cause there two bricks is what it cost
I had a bottom bitch was bossy too; I put her on the molly
And my bank account so pregnant and my pocket need pilates
People think i'm crazy cause I keep buying Ferraris
I'm in that brand new Bentley, bitch
It cost be about three Maseratis (it's Gucci)

[Verse 3]
Xanax have a nigga head sleep
Mesha sofa
Mollies quicker picker upper
Fuck with no rubber
Stuck my dick in her mouth
She blew me like a whistle
My friend lick my balls
Shot nut like a pistol

Ballin' so crazy think I need an agent
White girl doin' it white girl
Caucasian
Sellin' legal product;
Put you on the open cages
Back to school?
Be a doctor?
I ain't got no patience

Fast money
Fast cars
I'm in fifth gear
Ten shots at your table
25ths over here
Yo plug from another hood?
Mine from mexico
XR, high as hell
I got gas, fourty-lo
