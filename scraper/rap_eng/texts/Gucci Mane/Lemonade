[Intro]
Yeah it’s Gucci, wassup baby
Yellow everything this time
You know what I’m talking about
Yellow rims, yellow big booty yellow bones
Yellow Lambs, yellow MP's, yellow watch
Yellow charm ring chain, yellow living room set (Chiquita!)
Lemonade Gucci shoes for my girl, it’s Gucci

[Verse 1]
My Phantom sitting on sixes, no twenties in my denim
Your Cutlass motor knocking because it is a lemon
I like them Georgia peaches but you look more like a lemon
These sour apple bitter bitches I'm not fucking with 'em
I'm truly stupid paid, that's just how I feel today
I'm moving slow cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade
I'm standing in the shade and I'm selling lemonade
Six hundred a pint, the going rate off in the A
Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in your face
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday
I'm pimping wearing lemon, that's just how I'm chilling
I'm smoking grits and selling chickens, Corvette painted lemons (Gucci)

[Hook]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemonade and shade with my feet up
Lemonade and shade with my feet up
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up

[Verse 2]
I got lemonade and lemon-tint, lemons watch me mix the shit
Lemonade-complexion East-Australian girl be killing me
She say I be killing her, I say I be feeling it
Four days then I'm sick of her cause her brain is lemonhead
Cocaine-white exterior, interior lemonade
Yellow with the off-white trimming, I call that the super drank
Yellow diamond pinky ring, call that there the lemon rock
Jewelry box a lemon bin, my ear ring size of apricot
Yeah I smoke that strong a lot, yeah I need some of what you got
Half a pound of lemon kush, call that pack the lemon drop
Canary yellow lemon watch, big bird, yellow top
Yellow Polo, Polo slippers, white and yellow Polo socks
Gucci Mane be pumping dog, he don't got all he say he got
Just stash one Lemon homie, I can supply them the fifty Glocks
Yellow boat parked at the dock, yellowbone gon' make the drop
Flip the flop, mine off the top then go buy me a yellow yacht

[Hook]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemonade and shade with my feet up
Lemonade and shade with my feet up
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up

[Verse 3]
Lemonade my townhouse in Miami I want yellow carpet
Woke up in the morning - "Fuck it," bought a yellow Aston Martin
Yellow bricks, yellow dust, yellow ring, yellow tuss
Yellow pills, spinning wheels, yellow weed, re-up with us
Coward ass nigga, yellow stripe, you a yellowback
AK hit your dog, and you can't bring Old Yeller back
Yep Gucci bang up eighty thousand: that's a yellow safe
Yello, holmes. Mellow, holmes. You know you a scary-cat
No sleep for two days, so my pupils look yellow
Five flights, six shows, quarter-million on my schedule
Bangladesh and Gucci Mane – niggas know they in trouble
Green ice, red light. Caution: Gucci rock yellow

[Hook]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemonade and shade with my feet up
Lemonade and shade with my feet up
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
