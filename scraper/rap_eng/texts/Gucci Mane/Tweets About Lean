[Gucci Mane: Tweets the Negative Effects of Lean]

Woke up the other day out this hospital bed & I'm so embarrassed & ashamed of my behavior that was brought to my attention.

I just wanna man up right now & take this time to apologize to my family, friends, the industry & most of all my fans. I'm SORRY!

I've been drinking lean for 10+ years & I must admit it has destroyed me. I wanna be the first rapper to admit, I'm addicted to lean & that shit ain't no joke. I can barely remember all the things I've done & said. However there's no excuse.

I'm currently incarcerated but I will be going to rehab because I need help. I wanna thank everyone that has stood by me during this difficult time. Please keep me in your prayers. #GUWOP

I wanna personally apologize to Birdman, Ross & Drake. Dem my niggas. I 100% regret my words & actions .

Keyshia Dior Kaoir I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
All dem fake guwop twitter pages y'all niggas can fall back now.
