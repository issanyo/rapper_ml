[Verse 1]
Hit the mall spend 30 like the shit normal
Me and my broad nothing but Gucci, Louis, Ferragamo
Drop racks, get it back
Call the shit karma
Fuckin models when I want
All your hoes normal
Blowing kush
What your smokin smellin really normal
Ask me if I wanna hit it
I don't really wanna
Pulled up, old school, paint willy wonka
Cuts all white, but the rims abnormal
Backseat on my rolls in my silk pajamas
Hoppin out in house shoes like the shit normal
Change my jewelery every day cuz it the summer
If yo bitch want my number
Chill, it's really normal

[Hook]
Abnormal, nothing that I do is normal
Ice game dumb dumb, now it's even dumber
You normal
I'm so cold I need a thermal
Drumma boy track
Drumma, this another comma
It's my summer
She thick her ass is far from normal
It's no wonder her boyfriend keep a stupid number
My summer, she think her ass is far from normal
No wonder her boyfriend get that stupid llama

[Verse 2]
He pull up in a Honda

I pull up in a Zonda same color lasagna
My goons'll put you under
Confront us
Got guns like Super Contra
Stay armored
You bought your girl some (ahh ahh)
Don't want 'em
My girl got on piranhas
That's abnormal
My bracelet cost a honda

We'll rob you where I come from
That's a promise
She's a snake charmer
Anaconda

[Verse 3]
Bad bitches be stuntin me
They all wanna fuck, they warnin me
So I told her to kiss her homegirl
She said "i don't do that normally"
Shit I don't do shit the normal way
Gotta fuck with me the enormous way
Back in the day, humongous yay
I don't do that front shit normally
Me and flocka rockin iced out ornaments
Make a hit then start performin it
Got a club funked out like parliament
Brick squad we ain't with all the normal shit
She a dime piece, but you a normal bitch
Real ??? max girl can't work the stick
Won't touch the girl, nor hit the girl
She's just a normal ass chick in a normal world
It's Gucci baby, you a Gucci girl
Het a one way ticket to Gucci's world
Where night time it even gets warmer baby
Don't fuck with him, he too normal baby
It's Gucci baby, you a Gucci lady
Pull my dick out make you say "Gucci's crazy"
Night time it even gets warmer baby
Don't fuck with him, he too normal baby
