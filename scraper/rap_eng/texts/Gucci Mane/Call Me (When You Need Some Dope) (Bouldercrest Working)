[Hook: Gucci Mane]
You can call me ugly, but you can't call me broke
Matter of fact, you need to call me when you need some coke
Wanna buy some blow? Then, nigga, call your folks
Matter of fact, you need to call me when you need some dope
Call me when you need some dope, call me when you need some dope
Matter of fact, nigga, just call me when you need some dope
Call me when you need some dope, call me when you need some dope
Matter of fact, nigga, just call me when you need some dope

[Verse: OJ da Juiceman]
I'm trapping like a fool, 30 inches on the Hummer ride
Mad 'cause I killed your buddy and I beat the homicide
Flying in the Donk, same color tractor trailer tires
Raised in the A and you swear I had some mob ties
Pappadeaux shark mea, chilling with the mob guys
Fifty bricks, hundred bales, distributing the small fry
Young Juiceman whip more chickens than Popeye's
Bouldercrest working and I'm still whipping cream pies
Right hand Jacob, chain colored tie-dye
'71 Chevelle orange, flying like a skydiver
Left hand bracelet 'bout the color of a wildflower
Young Juiceman on flame like a wildfire
