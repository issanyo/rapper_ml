[Intro: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci, haaa
I'd like to thank God

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
God oh God oh God, I'd like to thank you for the dope
I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray, I make it with the coke
I made some mils and lost some now I'm richer than the Pope
(?) the girl, oh shit I think I seen a ghost
God oh God oh God, I hope I get the dope
I hope I get this case done I hope I touch down with the bloat
I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray, I touch down with the yoke
God oh God oh God, I like to thank you for the dope

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Young 5'8 tall like he 10 feet tall
Chopper make a nigga jump a 10 foot wall
Avian and gold bottles, this is hood royalty
No matter how broke, how rich
Nigga, never ever compromise your loyalty
Medusa head on my Versace robe
Standing on a pole of white bricks
Imagine crosses on the units
Stamps looking like a crucifix
Pure like the blood of Virgin Mary
Turn water to some wine, nigga
Plug did a touchdown, met him at the Steak & Shake at Mount Zion nigga

[Hook: Jeezy]
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Young 5'8 tall like he 10 feet tall
Chopper make a nigga jump a 10 foot wall
God shit, I'm on my Kanye
Bad bitch she my Kim K
Legend is that he made a million dollars
But the nigga really started with a four weight
Whom shall I fear, nigga
The plug say it's no limits
I sent the man right here, nigga
Snatch a partner out the state pen
Hallejulah, amen
Pull a little water from the sink
Hope it wash away the sin, nigga
The foe did a touchdown
Met him at theMet him at the Chanterelleâ€™s in West End, nigga

[Hook: Jeezy]
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga

[Outro: Jeezy]
