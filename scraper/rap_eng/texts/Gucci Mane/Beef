[Intro:]
Hey Man, this the squad phone number’s three letters
More money, more bitches
(This is a DJ new era exclusive)

[Verse 1:]
Your nigga's a pussy, we smack him around
Pull out my pistol, I’m backing him down
Running your mouth, and I’m running in your house
Call to my nest, and we jerking you down
You buying a ounce, and you breaking it down
Hop in the house, and I’m burning it down
You walking away while I'm talking to you
With this A.K will hit you until you die
Desert will hit you, it will take off a leg
Death on your fingers to get to the bread
Came from the country, I served my family
That’s why I tell niggas to rock better lead
Hit in the head for something you said
Torture a nigga, I wanted him dead
You leave me no options, you telling the feds
The apartment was white, but I painted it red
Fuck a red girl while you deep on my dick
You love me so much, she check pay me respect that's twice on your neck
Came on the Chris and got shot in the chest
Cut off your fingers and cut off your thumb
And I want you niggas to throw up your set
Killing the driver and shooting the passenger
Back seat niggas can’t get out the rest

[Chorus] [x2]
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh [x3]
Brick Squad for life, nigga inked it in my flesh

[Verse 2:]
I tell my nigga dissecting beef
He eat that niggas flesh
Cold world, I see that nigga breath
School of hard knocks, got my heater on my desk
Being head for my school while I’m cheating on my test
No beginning, it’s the end of you
Burning on me, raising temperatures
You are not a fucking killer, but gather all my niggas perpendicular
Back when niggas was younger, you were the lamest
Yeah…I remember you
Facts upon me, no servina
Serving nigga no suprena
No nigga, I ain’t no killer but don’t push me
Came in the game, we got good seats
Real nigga know I ain’t squashing no hood beef
What nigga? Don’t front nigga, you’re a fuck nigga, shot nigga
Free my nigga ride though, and R.I.P to the dump nigga

[Chorus] [x2]

[Bridge:]
I don’t owe you niggas shit, fuck favors
$64, 000 for this rollie, fuck the haters
I, I don’t owe you niggas shit, fuck favors
$64, 000 for this rollie, fuck the haters

[Chorus] [x2]
