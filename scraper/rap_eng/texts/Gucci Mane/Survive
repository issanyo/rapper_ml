[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Don Diablo, Guwop

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
We survived the thunder
And escaped the hunger
And sometimes I wonder, how we got through
Who knows what they'll ask us
We don't need no answers
'Cause we stand to serve as living proof

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane and Don, catch me ballin' out in London
Tom Brady with the paper, I go Super Bowl Sunday
Usain Bolt, crazy running till the hundreds
I keep my neck and my wrist at least a hundred
Hood nigga with the money and they lovin' it
She got comfortable, she called me by my government
Pull up in a Rolls with the white seats
And pull off in a Porsche like a car thief
I'm cocky, beat that pussy up like Rocky
I fly to Amsterdam for the right fee
These dudes ain't nothing like me, they car thieves
I booked her for the night, paid her bar fee
Told her charge it to the gang, black Wall Street
Shark blue coupe with a shark fee
Multi-millionaire, can't get 'em off me
Gucci Mane and Don catch me ballin' out in...

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
We survived the thunder
And escaped the hunger
And sometimes I wonder, how we got through
Who knows what they'll ask us
We don't need no answers
'Cause we stand to serve as living proof

[Verse 2: Emeli Sandé & Gucci Mane]
You got a fast car, I gotta dream of something
You are a hot wire, I like to push your buttons
We gotta somehow, get out of town
We drove for ages, never looking back once
They wanna cage us, but we prefer our freedom
Call us outrageous, well how about now?
Don Diablo Guwop

[Refrain: Gucci Mane & Emeli Sandé]
Gucci Mane and Don
Catch me ballin' out in London
Tom Brady with the paper, I go Super Bowl Sunday
Usain Bolt, crazy running till the hundreds
I keep my neck and my wrist at least a hundred
Hood nigga with the money and they lovin' it
She got comfortable, she called me by my government
Pull up in a Rolls with the white seats
And pull off in a Porsche like a car thief
Well we here are, living proof
Well we here are, living proof

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
We survived the thunder
And escaped the hunger
And sometimes I wonder, how we got through
Who knows what they'll ask us
We don't need no answers
'Cause we stand to serve as living proof
