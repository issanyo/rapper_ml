[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Haaaan, woo!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I got all this sauce on me
And I still ain't met a nigga drippin' sauce like me (haan)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Bel-Air mint condition, drop top, I feel like the Fresh Prince (drop top)
Your bitch say I'm sexy, ask me can she take a selfie (yah)
Mr. Davis with the latest, say when they address me (mwah)
I done got too rich to let these broke ass cops arrest me
Bookbag full of hundreds on me, please don't put your hands on me (no)
I don't play for the Hawks, but they still ain't got more cash than me (hah)
Rerockin' the rerock like I'm remixin' the remix
He just bought a V6, I just whipped a free brick
Takin' yay to Birmingham, I'm tryna make it safely
My strap don't got no safety, my safe don't got no spacey
I came to work with extra weight, I feel like Eddie Lacy
Two piece for the 80, the piece go for the tre-6

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got all this sauce on me
And I still ain't met a nigga drippin' sauce like me
I got all this sauce on me
Yeah, yeah, it's Pablo Juan, yeah1017...
And I still ain't met a nigga drippin' sauce like me

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Yeah, walk in the room with like 50 thousand
Smell like a money counter
Water drip, I left from the fountain
Pick picks, I walk on the counter
Smokin' gelato by the pound
I hit the pussy for 12 rounds
Designer snakes, Gucci'd down
And I stay with a hundred rounds
Eat it up, yum yum
It's fine, but I don't want nothin' but tongue
These samples, one of ones
Audemars rich, that's a pun
Girl, I just wanna have fun
Come in, I'm dressin' like James Bond
Broke boy, you can't make bond
I'm dressin' my bitch in that Louis Vuitton
I got a lot of carats like my family rabbits
No wonder why these bitches wanna get married
Got a new foreign car, call it Inspector Gadget (skrrt, skrrt)
I keep it on me, yeah, they know I'm a savage
$250 worth of jewelry, fuck the jewelry
Nigga, I'm gettin' money, I ain't worried
Honeycomb furs and she stir while I swerve
Neck new chain alert, watch your bitch, she flirt
Drop top vert with a hundred K in my purse

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I got all this sauce on me
And I still ain't met a nigga drippin' sauce like me
I got all this sauce on me
And I still ain't met a nigga drippin' sauce like me
