Angel wings, angel wings
Angel wings, angel wings
I'm so high, bitch I got angel wings
I'm so fly, bitch I got angel wings
Angel wings, angel wings
Angel wings, angel wings
I'm so fly, bitch I got angel wings

[Verse 1: Icewear Vezzo]
Way up, way up, yeah, yeah
Nah, nah they wanna cut a deal I ain't cuttin' deals, nigga run the scrill'
Add us up it's a 100 mill
Yeah, the first trip I had a 100 mill
Froze it all like water chill
Did it on my own I ain't want a deal
Fuck the drama, put it on my mama if I wanna kill bitch I'm gonna kill
Catch me up, I won't take the stand
I'm a real man I'm the son of Millz
Real man, I'm the son of Millz, yeah
Pour my sprite up, I like it ice cold
Tryna summer jam into the ice show
Used to have me a Breitlo
Now the daddy glowin', I'm a lightshow
Louies on, not the spikes though
Y'all be sippin' thin, call it tight rope
Diamonds water, shit I might soak
Yo bitch pussy deep I need a lifecoach
We gon' buy it all if the price low
We gon' ride the pussy if the shit too high
Baby mama said I get too high, light this bitch up once and did that shit two times
8 of red, I don't sip 2 lines
If that chickens short, we gon' get you fried
They love the crew, say we get too live
Got a 100 on me, finna mix two pies

[Bridge: Icewear Vezzo]
Way up, way up
Way up, way up
I'm so fly, I'm so high

Angel wings, angel wings

I'm so fly, bitch I got angel wings
Angel wings, angel wings
Angel wings, angel wings
I'm so fly, bitch I got angel wings
I'm so high, bitch I got angel wings

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
From Zone 6 to 6 Mile I make a crackhead walk six miles
Vezzo got six cars well Gucci got sick styles, hah
This a plug club, you ain't worth a mill you can't get in, hah
I got the molly sand, I took a half a gram it just kicked in
When I first start sellin' dope I met this bitch named Angel
Put me on a lick, I kicked the door and said 'thank ya'
See Guwop's not a stranger to sellin' white rectangles
So many pints of lean they think I'm Kurt Kobanga
You should pay attention to the ones these boy be listenin' to
APs on both wrists is boo
I stepped up my visual
They should make a holiday for the day that they let Gucci free
Fuck a turkey giveaway, Gucci givin' out bricks for free
Look at you and look at me, how the fuck could you write a hook for me
Slickest nigga ever lived, they should write a book 'bout me
Gucci just got out the Feds but now he make a mill a week
Bring me all the currency and motherfuck your sympathy
