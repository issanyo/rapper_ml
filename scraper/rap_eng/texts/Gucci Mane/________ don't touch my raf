[Intro: A$AP Annet & Playboi Anya]
I done came up (yuh)
Bustin' down a whole bag (bag)
Broke nigga, step back (for what?)
Why don't you peep a nigga's swag? (yuh)
You ain't even gotta ask (for what?)
What are those? What is that? (yuh)
Please, don't touch my Raf (please, don't touch my Raf)
Please, don't touch my Raf (for what?)

[Verse 1: annetiwe]
I'm racked up like rappers
I'm Raf'd up on camera
Get knocked out on camera
Squeeze pump like asthma
It's rare Raf when I wear Raf
Bare Raf when I wear Raf
Might invest into some Raf shares
Lil' niggas still share Raf
Yeah and I'm drippin' on racks
Rick Owens be the tag
Do the digital dash
Yeah, I'm boastin', never brag
Please, don't touch my Raf
Bought a Kris Van Assche
Alessandro Gucci glasses
J.W. Anderson collab
Yeah, she pop it like a Mac
Yeah, she drop it on the bag
I'ma buy another bag
'Cause she always bring it back
Yeah, you know how to make it last
Plus, a nigga keepin' tabs
I'ma fly first class
Quavo, hit 'em with the dab
Please, don't touch my Raf
[Verse 2: annetiwe]
Ho, don't step on my Raf Simons (yeah, Raf)
Ho, don't step on my Raf Simons (uh, Raf)
Ho, don't step on my Raf Simons (ooh)
Do you know how much I'm spendin'? (huh, ooh)

[Verse 3: annetiwe]
Huh? What?
Don't want 'em talkin' 'bout the paper
I swear to God these niggas be haters (yeah)
They be hatin', I feel all the vapors
Live in cul-de-sac, gon' get that lawn
Ooh, right with my neighbors (yeah)
Diamonds on my neck and Rollie on
Now Atlanta got all different flavors
Hit that bitch right on with my lightsaber
Ooh, feel like Darth Vader
I'm a boss, so you know I might Wraith you
Ooh, Raf in my basement (yeah)
Yeah, pass the gas
