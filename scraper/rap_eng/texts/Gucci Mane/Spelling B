[Verse 1: Young Sizzle]
It was me and P-O-T
Swerve the whip, no T-O-P
Bitch I want some T-O-P
Keep that chicken, KFC
Got a penthouse, T-O-P
It’s so high up, T-O-P
How’d you buy the fuckin’ Rari?
It’s imported, T-O-P
And this Rollie telling stories, it’s like I’m at the T-O-P
On the west like TDE, all white coupes like CMG
Want a bid like CMB, I see net like LBG
I love the realest, free BG
It’s T-O-P, I’m at the peak
Got to run it T-O-P, don’t need no motherfuckin’ sleep
And them youngins got them bales here
Thuggin’ like I’m YSL
Dick eatin’, auntie yeah you know a nigga fly as hell
I just bought an X6, I think that shit could drive itself

[Hook: Young Sizzle]
Niggas say they lookin’ for me, bitch I’m at the T-O-P
I just spent a nigga’s budget, that’s what they don’t G-E-T
Bitches know I’m gettin’ money, baby you my P-E-T
You just spell that nigga’s whole name like a spelling bee
Bitch I’m tryna run the whole game, what you sellin’ me?
Bitch I’m tryna run the whole game, what you sellin’ me?
Never do I know these ho’s names, such a D-O-G
Know a nigga want the whole thing, got to E-A-T

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Southside from the south side, Gucci from the E-A-G
East Atlanta Georgia, was raised up on the B-C-T
Bouldercrest Road, and you know I got them P-I-E’s
Know the streets like my ABC’s but I’ma keep the K with me
Grah, grah grah grah, wish a nigga play with me
RIP to Dunk, used to kick it every day with me
Please don’t check the trunk, police know I got AR’s on me
You niggas need to chill, you don’t want to go to war with me
Baow baow baow, G-L-O-C-K on me
Got a thirty round in it and a nigga that’ll spray for free
Baow baow baow, G-L-O-C-K on me
Got a thirty round in it and a nigga that’ll spray for free

[Hook: Young Sizzle]
Niggas say they lookin’ for me, bitch I’m at the T-O-P

Bitches know I’m gettin’ money, baby you my P-E-T

Bitch I’m tryna run the whole game, what you sellin’ me?
Bitch I’m tryna run the whole game, what you sellin’ me?
