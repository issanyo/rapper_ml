[Intro]

[Verse 1:Tomi]

HAIR SHORT, LEGS LONG

OH YOU THINK YOU BAD WIT ALL THAT POPPIN OFF

[VERSE 2: Gucci]

YEAAAAAAAH, BURRRR!
THEY SAY HALF MY CARS ARE FOREIGN
CUS I'm SUCH A SHOWOFF
I'm GUCCI MANE THE FLAIR
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME THE BOSS
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
COUNT THE SHIT AT THE HOUSE
THESE PLAYA HATERS CAN'T KEEP MY NAME OUT THEY MOUTH
I TOOK YA GIRLFRIEND FROM YA ARM
COUNT THE SHIT AS A LOSS
I WONâ€™T BUY A BOTTLE WATER
BUT YOU BOUGHT HER A PORSCHE
AND WHEN THE BOTTLES COME IT LOOKIN LIKE JULY ON THE 4TH
AND WHEN I SMASH OFF IN THE RARI
YOU CAN EAT MY EXHAUST
ALOT OF PEOPLE CALL IT SWAGG, BUT I CALL IT THE SAUCE
WHITE TUXEDO ON, ON THE FRONT OF THE SOURCE
I GOTTA TRENCH THAT STAND UP AT THE SOUND OF MY VOICE
I'm NOT A PREACHER WHEN I COME, ALL THE WOMEN REJOICE GUCCI!

PRE: REPEAT

[HOOK: Tomi]

SEE I BEEN THERE, YEAH I DONE THAT
THESE KIDDIE GAMES, STOP THAT
ALL THIS FOOLISHNESS, GOT MY NAME ALL IN YO MOUT
BUT I GUESS YOU GOT NOTHIN BETTA THAN ME TO TALK ABOUT
SO CARRY ON, DO AS YA DO
KEEP PROMOTIN ME, YA SILLY GOOS
I TOOK A BREAK, BUT LOOK ME NOW
THAT'S A BAD BITCH, POSTA CHILD

PRE: REPEAT

HOOK: REAPEAT
