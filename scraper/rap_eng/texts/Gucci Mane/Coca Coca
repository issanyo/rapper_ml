[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boiling water, damn I gotta forced game
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Mi casa su casa partna, mi casa so full of rastas
More ganja then reefer farmers, you couldn't see me with binoculars
White girl with me; Cindy Lauper, multi deep like Frank Sinatra
Gave 10 birds to Waka Flocka, told him drop em at Moreland Plaza
Flow sick like the morning after, try me then yo skull get fractured
Ransom yo lil hansom son, so sad yo that first daughter captured
Gucci hot as boiling water, my pack just came cross the border
Your girlfriend's a major snorter, but that bitch ain't worth a quarter
Don't give that another toughta, if you serve me then get shot up
Ounce, a half, a eighth, a quarter, send my goons to do the slaughter
Hustle hard got from my father, take no shit got from my mother
Never snitched and never will, I put that on my baby brother

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boiling water, damn I gotta forced game
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Only one dude and I'mma smoke my reefer
Cruise through the city in my new two-seater
Stay low key and get doe wit my people
Maybe try to find me some blow a little cheaper
Only one dude and I'ma ride around town
Work got love bitch, drop a few pounds
Count a few checks deal them out
Shoot a lil dice, pour a lil out
Sell a lil poweder make a few thou'
Turn them into millions standing tall as Yao
Mean mug everything about my team
Nigga say anything, folk will hit him in his mouth
Back in the day they said I wouldn’t be shit
Tell them fuck niggas "nigga look at me now!"
Mami on my dick, they worse than they bitch
It don’t make no sense we just laugh at them clowns
Pull up to the club everybody like "wow!"
Watch cost a car, car cost a house
Catch me in the club I’m stunting on the couch
Balling like a balla me and Gucci ballin' out
Shawty got it for the low who said it was a drought?
Swag run so hard man these hoes like “Ow"
Well known in the North, raised in the South
Connected out West get them in get them out

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boiling water, damn I gotta forced game

Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
In the kitchen with Patrick Swayze, me and the yay is dirty dancing
Drop a gold deuce and it white just like some Louie Glass
Stupid Brick Squad chickens in stankin' through the plastic
Gettin ‘em in and gettin’ em gone; definition of a trapper
I’m the hottest thing walkin' around in East Atlanta
So I’m like a baby, shittin' like a damn pamper
They hatin' my swag, cause these bars is Alaska
Hip-hop police got me workin' under the scanner
Coca cola where’s the water? Watch this doe I serve this order
One on the window, cause the police just might smell this odor
Barber shops and beauty parlors, just to cover dirty dollars
White girl was super dirty, so I put her in the shower

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boiling water, damn I gotta forced game

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
Soo Woo! To the B Gang, it’s a G thang, see me
I’m eyeballin' shorty, Gucci got the work and Flocka got the 40
Work the wheels, and hold the gun, smoke out my pistol, I wish you’d run
Nigga win some, like which one 100-round chopper or the handgun
Heard I ain’t never lost none, I got nicks and dimes you want some
I’m a legend in the hood like Big Pun, got bales of the mid you want some, I got them
Waka Flocka, Flocka Waka, midgrade bought me everything
I’m gudda gudda, gudda gudda, I put that shit on Gucci Mane
Brick Squad is what the fuck I claim, God y'all niggas off the chain (Loony)
Lookin' like he want my chain, I smoke him like some Mary Jane
And shorty that shit real talk
And shorty that shit real talk

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend

[Verse 5: Shawty Lo]
Shawty Lo, call me Escobar
They try to retire me like the great Brett Favre
Still got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Even Nicki, fuckin' with my girlfriend
Yeah, we share that bitch
Got Waka Flocka, Gucci, Rocko in that bitch
Still in the kitchen, flickin' the wrist
And I’m still on the highway, takin' the risk
Back and forth, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20 with a bunch of them bricks
Ayy, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20, all white bricks

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Feds coming after us, niggas talkin bout jackin us
Married to that white girl so bitch I ain’t no bachelor
Brick Squad Re-up Gang, mothafuckin' yayo club
Lookin for another one cause I ran off on my last plug
Off white Jag, white truck, white Lambo
All white Porsche four door going ham ho
You know who I am ho (GOTTI!) You say I robbed yo brother
I don’t give a damn though; he must've had the yams low
He must've had them grams off weighing what I paid for
Too many of them bands now he laying on his man floor
I’m Yo Gotti nigga and I’m from North Memphis
In East Atlanta Zone 6 and I got the North with me

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang

[Verse 7: Nicki Minaj]
I got that hard Gucc, you know these bitches easy
I got that cold flu, I got that itchy sneezy
You in that Mitsubishi, I'm in that Bentley GT
I'm takin' trips with Papi, you walkie-talkie copy
I got them pookie fiends, might rock some Juicy jeans
I mean some Juicy sweats; maybe some blue Giuseppes
I play foul; no free-throw, bitch I ball, no free show
Deadass; no peep-show, bought our own condo, water-front condo
Daughter, son dundo; watchin' Telemundo
Flyer than a rocket, money in my polly-pocket
What'chu coppin'?
Keep that work inside my Pippi Longstocking, bitch

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
