Why y'all keep on worrying 'bout what Flock doin'
You need worry if you got life insurance
Why you keep worryin bout what Gucci Doin'
You need to worry if you got Embalming Fluid
Why y'all keep on worrying 'bout what Flock doin'
You need worry if you got life insurance
Why you keep worryin bout what Gucci Doin'
You need to worry if you got Embalming Fluid
Embalming Fluid, Embalming Fluid
Burn yo body up we need some lighter fluid
Lighter Fluid, Lighter Fluid
End of the day you shouldn't of got into it
Got into it, got into it
End of the day we shouldn't have got into it

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Broke fifths in my bag bitch
I'mma shoot first not asking shit
Before I talk to em bring chalk to em
I'mma blast them put a fork in it
Gun fight you brought knife in it
You gambling with your life in it
Playing with your wife god damn this is sad business
Good playin' but bad intentions
Talkin' long but the man don't listen
Shootout for thirty minutes
Were in the kitchen son getting a whole damn kitchen
Gotta life but I might risk it
Still serving these White chicks
Drink white liquor for white bitches might pull up in my white Bentley
Why you worry bout Flocka business what he eat ain't makin you shit
Why you worry bout Gucci business like groupie bitches you all on my dick
