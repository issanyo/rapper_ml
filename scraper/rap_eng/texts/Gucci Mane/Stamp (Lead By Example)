[Intro]
Yeah he can run a TD, But I'ma run a CD
He may run a 4:3, But you won't run up on me (x3)
Gucci got money, My off days are Sunday
And I don't do the push ups, I just do the cook ups
Gucci got money, My off days are Sunday (x5)
(Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money)

[Verse 1]
Gucci got money, My off days are Sunday
And I don't do the push ups, I just do the cook ups
She can shoot the layup, and I'm a weight it yeh up
And late night we stay up, from breakdowns and breakups
(East Atlanta Zone 6)
26 year old rookie named Gucci, Came in the game well trained like flutie (Flutie!)
Mike Vick creeping like more of my flows stupid
Noorwood vision, see hoes and run through it
Flows like the Falcons receiver you need practice
Damn I run beside them, that's why they go backwards
Gucci back at em with plans to go platinum
Already seeing the Craig before it happen (What's up Craig)
Gucci gladiator on track he brought action
I'm here to entertain so Icey Gucci Atlantic (Pussy!)

[Hook]
Foreign Engines vehicles arm and pistols
Black supermodels gang kush and ballers
Gucci summer July I'm Santa
The bricks say Gucci cause Gucci Man stamp em
White blocks taped up like kids pampers
Gucci Mane been drankin somethin known to cause cancer
Gucci Manes a problem
AI is an answer
Boss man Gucci and I lead by example

[Verse 2]
Born an Atlanta Baby
Border see border Clayton
Catch me at the Liberal places outside the station (Yeaaaaaah)
Every occasion crowd participation
Waiting, anticipating precipitation
Foreign publishers got me living baby
Half a pound of bubba kushie got me feeling crazy
3 crazy colored charms got me feeling deadly
I'm Diddy, I'm Busta, I'm 50, I'm Missy
Yellow rocks pissy
Its Radic, Atlantic
Never fucked an actress, signed with Atlantic
Niggas speak senseless, sort of speak Spanish
If I use Pig Latin, Chicken talk trappin
Gucci rock Cracknium, Crayola and Platnium
Color just bermuda, White Diamonds Aspen
Pinky ring Asia, Earings Jamacia
My Ice Game Major
Gucci Mane the glacier

[Hook]
Foreign Engines vehicles arm and pistols
Black supermodels gang kush and ballers
Gucci summer July I'm Santa
The bricks say Gucci cause Gucci Man stamp em
White blocks taped up like kids pampers
Gucci mane been drankin something known to cause cancer
Gucci Mane's a problem
AI is an answer
Boss man Gucci and I lead by example

[Verse 3]
Gucci marv Movie
Cash and burn Tuesday
Uzi back roggie, Fire when fired fruity
Necky wrist looney, goofy and cartoony
Yellow stones moony Prime rocks dew dewy
Gucci can't do it doggie im not stoopid
Decapitated Benz, means the cars ruthless
10 gold toofis plans fams and groupies
Canada's Platter itineraries and music
Cameras candled candid and cago
Peaches Mango fine hoes and Quavo
Paint like Rainbow Pigeon toed 2 door
Gave the dealer 2 mo, the fuck I need a roof for
Gucci Rap Sumo Kitchen like Judo
My Jewelry box pluto
My Hummer truck new though
