[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Nice to meet you, be great to beat you
Teresa, the skeezer, the pumpkin eater
I paint her face like Mona Lisa
The more she moan the more I beat her
Three people, two seater
Pullin' up, I could eat lunch at Cheetah
Scarf's fur so I can't pose for PETA
Pockets looking like an encyclopedia
Baseball money like Derek Jeter
Standing in her face while a home girl eat her
That's my hitter, I don't need no nigga
And everytime she come, she bring a new girl with her
Multi-million dollar figures
Oh, that's your babe, well, I'm babysitting her
Hit her from behind like a fender bender
Diamonds hold the hand steady on my pinky finger

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Threesome, threesome, threesome, threesome
Threesome, threesome, threesome, threesome
Threesome, threesome, threesome, threesome
Threesome, threesome, threesome, threesome
That's your friend, then bring 'em here
Ain't no need to leave them
My bitch so bad, she reel 'em in, let's go have a threesome
Threesome, threesome, threesome, threesome
Threesome, threesome, threesome, threesome
Threesome, threesome, threesome, threesome
Threesome, threesome, threesome, threesome
Club close at like four o'clock, I pull up at like three-some
I'm too much for one of ya'll girls, let's go have a threesome

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
I do not need her, I'm planning to leave her
Don't give her my number, she hitting my beeper
I pull up, two girls, and I got a two-seater
I really want her, but I cannot keep her
I really want her, but she not a keeper
She a eater, give me head in my beater
Don't remember your name, but nice to meet you
Girl, you're so bad that she go off the meter
My outfit so fly had that shit on for three days
That girl a freak so we just had to three-way
They go off on Uzi, she'll feel like my B-day
Smashing the Coupe when a nigga on e-way
AP so frozen, it look like a three-face
Pockets so big like I just got a rebate
Yeah, she left you alone because, nigga, you is a cheapskate
Yeah, confetti come down when I come in my house like I just won a sweepstakes
Yeah, pescetarian but I order my niggas like three steaks
Yeah, put them diamonds in my mouth all the way till my teeth ache
Yeah, just fucked the cheerleader, told that girl to bring her teammate
