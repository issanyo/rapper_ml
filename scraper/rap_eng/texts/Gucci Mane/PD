[Hook: Plies]
You a real tall glass of water
Just looking at you made me thirsty
Oh Lord shes the preacher's daughter
But still I want her in the worst way
She shouldn't have came her in the first place
Special occasion it's her birthday
I swear to God I'm glad I caught her
Come blow the candles out baby
[Verse 1 Plies]
Ok, ok, ok, Animal ok, ok, Glamorous ok, ok
She's the preacher's daughter, but I'm a ghetto star, ok
She ain't going nowhere(why) because I just beat her raw, ok
Hooked her on the first shot, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, ok
I let her play Khloe, I just play Lamar, ok
She just hit my cell (why) cause she done left her bra, ok
I, I, I got her on quavo
Got her with her shorts off, looking at her vajayo
Driving with my fingers crossed hoping I don't go to hell
I, I, I got her rolling
I, I got her losing focus

[Hook: Plies]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
She like a devil with her red dress
I wanna get her in my incents
And plus I was just too fresh
She was flirting getting too fresh
She the preacher daughter on the alter
But, I spoil her like her father
I school her like a toddler
She with Gucci, so don't bother
I go harder and grind harder
I ride hard as she loving my persona
The aroma, a Kush ammonia
It's what she smells and I can't keep my hands off her (its Gucci)

[Verse 3 Plies]
Red plus she bowlegged her cherry no pit, yea
Caught on the six yep for later on the six, yea
One thing I can say about her, shawty takes the stick, yea
She was greener then a motherfucker now I got her talking slick
She get it from her momma, all in the hips
I love walking behind her, so I can see her twist
I think I hit her kidneys the last time I ripped
I felt kind of bad though, so I left her a tip
Her Becky on steroids, that's little momma gift
She don't like to drink it strong though, so I just let her sip
4 o'clock in the morning, that liquor had me stiff
But that's my little baby she know how to make a grip
