[Hook: Gucci]
I smell ya, nigga, you a failure
You pussy to me, hell ya
I think you a failure, you rookie to me
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga
I smell ya, nigga, you a failure
You pussy to me, hell ya
I think you a failure, you rookie to me
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga
See a pussy nigga slap a pussy nigga, pussy nigga

[Verse 1: Gucci]
See I'm the boss of bosses so please proceed with caution
Jewelry cost a fortune, my financial consultants
My 9 o'clock appointment, smokin' in ma office
Sippin on a latte, the speaker phone I'm talkin' (Hello)
Five thousand dollar jeans a quarter brick is balkin'
Chicken for a feature, but we feel that it's a bargin
The bezzle on my Bentley, wash it off just like a biscuit
Gucci Mane you pussies better bring security
Pitty you don't pitty me boy go join a sorority
So Icey the minority, it's Gucci the priority
???
Pounds of weed and ecstasy, my jewelry ??? is prejudice
Gucci Mane, So Icey boy, shinin' like a lighting bolt
Light bulb chandelier, lunar sun solar exclipes
Gucci man the blizzard, pussy wetter take a load of him
Pussy nigga, see a pussy nigga, slap a pussy nigga

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
You're pussier than my lollipop picture
I be up top pussy poppin' on the Gixter
Pop ya kickstand, little mama, I'm the Nicster
I'll pop you then I'll pop your little sister
You're pussier than a strip club dancer
Maybe Wayne shoulda called you the pussy monster
Pussy goin' bonkers, fuck is my bouncers
Niggas payin bucks to see my pussy at my concert
Pussy dis, pussy dat, pussy thick, pussy fat
Break me off a piece a dat, pussy-kit, pussy-kat
I smell pussy, get a pussy-tic pussy-tac
Wait, matter fact you are running from a pussy rat
See a pussy, slap a pussy and tell 'em that's the pussy
My pussy from another planet got that NASA pussy
I'm Minaj, that's Gucci, that's Wayne
Yeah, you coochie, stop playin'
