[Verse 1: V-Nasty]
I think they mad cause I'm relevant
Big choppers put holes in elephants
I got a bad bitch and she's elegant
Bet a hundred thousand that bitch selling it
I'm on the block, bitch I'm doing hella shit
Them suckers over there, looking is irrelevant
I got a bolo coming from Mexico
And if the bitches talking gas, they ass like Texaco
I'm a reckless ho, you can't check this ho
Bitch, my outfit cost more than your necklace, ho
And I'm doing shit that you never seen before
Having withdrawals, man, hurry where my blow

[Hook: V-Nasty]
Fuck you! Bitch fuck your mama too!
You can't fuck with us
You can't do what we do

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got a swag so sick make the whole crowd cough
I got a Lamborghini, hit the gas, the bitch get lost
You with a loser, need to lose him, it's not your loss
I got a suburban tender, she stay in Norcross
I'm a boss, you's a worker boy, go jerk off
Brick Squad on the stage, know our shirts off
And I'm horny as a rhino and her ass soft
I got a fetish for a fine ho: I break her off
Let's get it on, let's get it in
Let's get it on, do it again
So bring a friend if you want to
Don't tell me what you won't do
Want me like I want you? All night long!
Let's get it on!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slim Dunkin]
I fuck her, you lick her
I hit her and pass her
The number at the light, I'mma fuck her by tonight
She say a friend to dice, she allergic to the pipe
Angie ridin' around no shoes, fuckin' quittin' on dudes
10k from my parents
Same shoes on clearance
Fuck your mama, your sister and your kids
Would say fuck your girl but I already did
I be in and out her jaw, can't go in and out her raw
And I got them birds, man: I be stuntin like my paws
Do it private when I travel: plane
Louis in my baggie claim
Standing on them couches with V-Nasty and Gucci Mane
All the ice on my hands got my fingers cold
Call me Slim Dunk: I don't finger roll..
