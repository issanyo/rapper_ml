[Hook]
I can’t hang with no broke nigga, broke nigga, broke nigga
I can’t run around with no pilly nigga, pilly nigga, pilly nigga
You’s a pocket watcher, pocket watcher, pocket watcher, pocket watcher
Your brother a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher
Your motherfucking mother is a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher
I bet your baby mama is a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher
Know I trap, because I got that rocket launcher, rocket launcher

[Verse 1]
This Guwop, and I got them guns like super contra
Show me respect nephew, cause I’m still your uncle
Playing 50,000 dollars of chalk and double talk ya
My dope is Janet Jackson dancing, you Titanic, I sank ya
I’m a San Valley trap school professor and I flunk ya
I was a youngster, cocaine [?]
She be having nightmares, I’m a full grown monster
I’m a one man band, Gucci Mane, Stevie Wonder
Ice cream land, AKA zone 6 jungle
Put on your dark swag suit, open your mouth let me see your tonsils
Take two of these capsules, only take call me when you want some

[Hook]
I can’t hang with no broke nigga, broke nigga, broke nigga
I can’t run around with no pilly nigga, pilly nigga, pilly nigga
You’s a pocket watcher, pocket watcher, pocket watcher, pocket watcher
Your brother a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher
Your motherfucking mother is a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher
I bet your baby mama is a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher, a pocket watcher
Know I trap, because I got that rocket launcher, rocket launcher
