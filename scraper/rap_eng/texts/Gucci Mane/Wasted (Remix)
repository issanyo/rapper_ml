[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Burrr
It's Young Burrr
The State vs. Radric Davis
It's still Gucci
And we wasted

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rockstar lifestyle might don't make it (wasted)
Livin' life high everyday, clique wasted (wasted)
Sippin' on purple stuff, rollin' up stanky (wasted)
Wake up in the morning 10 o'clock drankin' (wasted)
Party party party let's all get wasted (wasted)
Shake it for me baby girl do it butt naked (wasted)
I'm so wasted, she so wasted (wasted)
Tell the bartender send me 20 more cases

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My alias is Gucci Mane, my name is Radric Davis (who)
If you take the time to step in front my shine, that time is wasted (wow)
See I don't got time to waste, 'less I waste it with the crew
Yo girl drunk, she dropped it low and waste Cris all over my shoes (well damn)
Back to the bass, (back to, back to, back to)
Man I'm racist (go) tho I'm not my ranch caucasion
Plus my goons smoke like jamacains (burrr)
You hot, but hatin on me
You sleepy, Gucci ain't hot? Homeboi you trippin
Still consider coke in my car so yo kinfolks gon keep drippin
I'm movin that 'caine like I'm moving my Range
Don't soil my name, just step up yo game
I'm a leave this game same way that I came
Can't waste my breath, no need to explain
Baby girl I wasted it, on my bracelet (burrr)
Didn't wanna walk though we maded it
This Wasted Remix with Baby, Wayne and 'Kiss and I cremated it
(GUCCI)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rockstar lifestyle might don't make it (wasted)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Rockstar lifestyle might not make it
President got him in the White House naked
Looked at the clock and it said right now
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panetela dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money baby, big shit like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti bat black, where they do that at?
South beach, Miami ho
I'm probably with Tammy To (Tammy Torres)
My life is a video, and the women want that cameo
I just want them pantyhose and I'm higher than geranimo
An I got the tools, tell em boys it can get mechanical

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rockstar lifestyle might don't make it (wasted)
Livin' life high everyday, clique wasted (wasted)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Rockstar lifestyle might not make it (Uh uh)
Wasted, just performed "We Gon' Make It" (yeah)
Bitches get naked off the stones in the bracelet (ha ha)
Said you got coke, I brought a fiend along to taste it (uh)
Money come fast now, we ain't gotta chase it (naw)
Kush got a nigga feelin' like he in The Matrix
Hennessy, Patron, Grey Goose, Aces (yeah)
Alcohol, Tobacco, firearm cases (T.I.)
Dufflebag double up, big faces (yes)
Tony Montana shit, crib spacious (yes)
Futuristic automobiles, spaceships (ha)
Jadakiss laced it, the remix Wasted

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Big money, make a pearl handle with 2 clips
Cash Money, Young Money fly, in new whips
All white pearl, money from the earl
Poppin' Don P iced out my baby girl
Catch me in the club with my mac and my strap on
Bitches high rollin', white doves, gettin' they freak on
Get my clap on, get my money on
Shinin' all the time, now watch me bring it home
S-s-so she love me, how we do this?
Maybach, lay back, baby how we do this
Lauder jet, G4, high to the sky bitch
Mo money than I've seen, no ceilings bitch

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rockstar lifestyle might don't make it (wasted)
Livin' life high everyday, clique wasted (wasted)
Sippin' on purple stuff, rollin' up stanky (wasted)
