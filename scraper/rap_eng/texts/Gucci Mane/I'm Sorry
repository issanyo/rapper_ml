[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ralo]
She say she ain't never fucked with Wop, I feel sorry for her
I feel sorry for that ho, I feel sorry for her
She say she ain't never fucked with Ralo, I feel sorry for her
I'm sorry, Ralo LaFlare, I feel sorry for her
He don't really know his girlfriend like he think he know her
I'm sorry for that dude, I feel sorry for her
He think he can save his girlfriend, I feel sorry for him
I'm sorry, I'm sorry for that dude, I feel sorry for her

[Verse 1: Ralo]
I'm sorry, I apologize
I'm nothing like a lot of guys
The only sign I know is dollar signs
I ain't been the same since my partner died
We never ran from no nigga
Ran up them bands in a rental
A thousand dollars for the denim
Just for my Act can be in 'em
It's hot as hell and I won't bust a sweat
Y'all never hanging where bosses at
A hundred thousand, what the fuck is that?
I lost that shit on a fuckin' bet
If you lose me that'll be your loss
I ain't worried 'bout you cuttin' me off
I am bigger than that nigga Ross
Tiger Woods can't beat me in golf
Tell 'em that they better not piss me off
They know I go in a nigga's mouth
They know I go in a nigga's house
Then put this dick all in a nigga's spouse
I feel sorry for your baby mama
A real nigga come and take her from ya
Make her suck the dick without a condom
And then kiss you in front of the mama

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ralo]
She say she ain't never fucked with Wop, I feel sorry for her
I feel sorry for that ho, I feel sorry for her
She say she ain't never fucked with Ralo, I feel sorry for her
I'm sorry, Ralo LaFlare, I feel sorry for her
He don't really know his girlfriend like he think he know her
I'm sorry for that dude, I feel sorry for her
He think he can save his girlfriend, I feel sorry for him
I'm sorry, I'm sorry for that dude, I feel sorry for her

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Big bankroll in my pockets, sittin' swole off it
I just spent a whole profit, talkin' like an old prophet
Gettin' head in the oval office, sippin' on a cold coffee
Big Guwop, I'm so bossy
Told her hold up, slow top it
Jefe the Ochoa brother
Gucci Mane a Felix brother
I cried real tears when they caught Chapo like we know each other
Me and money go together
Playboy mansion, Hugh Hefner
Kickin' flavor, David Beckham
Park my private jet on Gresham
She say she ain't never fucked with Wop, I feel sorry for her
Suck me up, you lucky devil
I brought out that Rari for her
He don't really know his girlfriend like he think he know her
Scented candles, Egyptian aura
I brought out that AP for her

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ralo]
She say she ain't never fucked with Wop, I feel sorry for her
I feel sorry for that ho, I feel sorry for her
She say she ain't never fucked with Ralo, I feel sorry for her
I'm sorry, Ralo LaFlare, I feel sorry for her
He don't really know his girlfriend like he think he know her
I'm sorry for that dude, I feel sorry for her
He think he can save his girlfriend, I feel sorry for him
I'm sorry, I'm sorry for that dude, I feel sorry for her
