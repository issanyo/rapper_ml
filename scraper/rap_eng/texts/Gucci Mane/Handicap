[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Well, I bounce in past the bouncer, with a handgun and a chopper
Well, I bounce in past the bouncer, with a handgun and a rifle
I might bounce in, me a bouncer, handgun and an ounce
Young nigga with a shotgun, and a handgun, and a rifle
Get pitched in, I’m a lifer – put my hand on the Bible
You walking fast, you need to slow up, ho
Acting lame, you need to grow up, ho
Got drank, I’m ‘bout to pour up, ho
I was broke, but I ain’t broke no more
No place the GuWop can’t go
Trap rap, fuck hip-hop, ho
Rambo with a loaded four-four
Commando, kick in your front door
Jesús, Alejandro
Get your whole family killed like El Chapo
Lots of guap and escundo
Drop the top, I’m in a new Lambo’
Let your daddy know, twin Calicos
And I’ll kill your ass if you like to gamble
County man, if your ass didn’t know
Like Cunningham I make your ass ran, ho
Afghanistan, I’m a travelling man
And when I pull up, got an army van
You must live in Fantasy Land
Cut off you and your partner hand
Candyman, I’m from the scrap
And I’ll leave your partner’s ass handicapped

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Handicap, handicap, handicap, handicap
Run up on me and I’mma leave you handicapped
Handicap, handicap, handicap, handicap
I keep a pistol by me, I’ve got handy scraps
Handicap, handicap, handicap, handicap
Shoot you in your head, youse in your partner lap
Handicap, handicap, handicap, handicap
Guap like the wheelchair niggas, handicapped

[Verse 2: Big Bank Black]
Heard he beefing with the mob, call him Two Wheel Willie
You ain’t no gangster, pussy nigga, youse a World Star bully
Just a key-boy gangster, talking tough as your train
We bustin’ tommy guns, pussy, like back in the day
I run with butcher-knife killers, they might chop off your fade
I got them crazy young niggas, they might jump out the state
Godfather status – I might spit in your face
And don’t be muggin’ pussy nigga, slap that look off your face
And if you want it, come get it – all my niggas with it
Got Nuke and Squeak with me, you know the carbon spittin’
You know them niggas hitting, you know they gone blast
If you fuck around and live, you in a body cast

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
