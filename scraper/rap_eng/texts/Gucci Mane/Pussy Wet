[Intro: Gucci Mane]
You fancy bitch
You fancy bitch
You fancy bitch
You fancy bitch
You fancy bitch
You fancy bitch
You fancy bitch

[Chorus: Marilyn Manson]
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Wet, wet
Wet, wet

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Don't wear no panties
She understand me
Damn shawty fancy
Panties hid in the pantry
They took for ransom
Red bottoms shawty fancy, they look like candy
Shawty look at you, like the way you dancin'
Marilyn said pussy wet
And now her pussy rainin'
Gucci said that he love her, he runnin' games man
Marilyn and Gucci Mane, and we private planed it
Smoking that Mary Jane
On the where to the game is

[Chorus: Marilyn Manson]
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Wet, wet
Wet, wet

[Verse 2: Marilyn Manson & (Gucci Mane)]
She said how big is your dick
I said how big is your mouth
(I said how wet do yo pussy get
That's all that I wanna know)
Panties to the side bitch
I wanna see your camel toe
(Bitch all jokes aside
Bitch I'm tryna' leave yo pussy soaked)
Bitch your pussy solid gold
It's solid gold
It's solid gold
(Open toes and camel toes
Ho that's all that you gotta show
Open toes and camel toes
That's all I see at all the shows)

[Chorus: Marilyn Manson]
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Wet, wet
Wet, wet

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Let that pussy free bitch
Let that pussy breath bitch
Let her go with me, I hope she leave a nigga sea sick
Suck it on ya' knees bitch
Let me fuck you free
I'm tryna' fuck you till you bleed bitch
Fuck you till you leave bitch

[Bridge: Marilyn Manson]
Fuck you till you leave bitch (fuck you fuck you)
Till you leave bitch

[Verse 4: Gucci Mane]
Give that bitch a napkin
I'ma fuck you till you sneeze bitch
I hope you wore your real hair
Cause I'ma pull ya' weave bitch
And when that pussy stupid wet like that
It make a nigga sleepy

[Chorus: Marilyn Manson]
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Getting pussies wet
Wet, wet
Wet, wet

[Outro]
