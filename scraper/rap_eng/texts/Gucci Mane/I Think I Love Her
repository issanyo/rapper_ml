Yellow Benz with a spoiler kit, with my spoiler chick
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist, match this yellow bitch
She a trip, shawty she the shit, she know she the shit
If you don't buy her what she want then she throw a fit

She a bitch, shawty mean as shit but she super thick
And she act silly like a kid, give her candy sticks
She a bit, make her flip a brick, make her sic a chick
Since legit, I've been swaggin' dick, Gucci Mane the shit

I met a girl named Suzie, I let her join my group
I know she's not a groupie, so I let her in my coupe
I snatched her in my fender while I stashed her in my tire
Suzie is a money maker but that bitch a liar

Suzie rollin' '08 'Rarri but that girl on fire
Pull us over, Calla Road, and say she has a price
Ten bricks in my car, shawty singin' like Mariah
Singin' like the choir, better yet, singin' like Mya, bitch

Well, my name is Suzie and Gucci think I love him
That sucka think I'm loyal but I fucks with all the hustlas
I be wit all the ballers, I be at all the spots
I might be in yo' kitchen nigga cookin' with yo' pop

I think I love her, nigga you don't love me
Nigga you don't love me, nigga you don't love me
I think I love her, nigga you don't love me
Nigga you don't love me, nigga you don't love me

I know I love her, nigga you don't love me
Nigga you don't love me, nigga you dont' love me
I know I love her, nigga you don't love me
Nigga you don't love me, nigga you don't love me
I think I love her

She sweet but keep, keep, she stains her eye ring
Two piece, she dime piece and jeans they dead meat
She sweet, she so deep, she reap with good teeth
Two jobs, she get cheese, her dates are my treat

How neat, she loves to eat, we eat, bon appetite
We feed, she's so neat and like me she so neat

Nigga always talk but I run the block
This bitch is so hot, my clip I close shop
My wrist froze with rocks, I cop all the drops
Unfold all the knots, expose the have-not's

My hoe's pose wit pops like young Goldie Locks
We got white bulgin' rocks, zip lock stocks the car
We never close this shop, we hot, steamin' hot
I'm Suzie Sarah plot, a-click-click, p-pop pop!

I think I love her, nigga you don't love me
Nigga you don't love me, nigga you don't love me
I think I love her, nigga you don't love me
Nigga you don't love me, nigga you don't love me

I know I love her, nigga you don't love me
Nigga you don't love me, nigga you don't love me
I know I love her, nigga you don't love me
Nigga you don't love me, nigga you don't love me
I think I love her
