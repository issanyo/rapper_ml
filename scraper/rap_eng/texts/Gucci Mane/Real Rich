[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Guwop! Wiz!
Taylor Gang, 1-0-1-7

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Ridin' around blowin' so much dope but I'm always handlin' business
Way too high don't pick up my phone, if I do, I'm like "Who is this?"
Ain't got time for a girlfriend, telling that bitch I ain't got no feelings
Young nigga straight from the bottom, now my car ain't got no ceiling
Young nigga stackin' up millions, y'all niggas actin' like children
Ouu, nigga couldn't used to get in, now I'm ownin' the building
Brought the bitch to my crib, said she felt like she went on a field trip
Nigga like me gon' always stack, when I'm older I'm probably gon' still get

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Baby, I'm a rich-ass nigga, never said I was gon' be easy to deal with
But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit
Baby, I'm a rich-ass nigga, never said I was gon' be easy to deal with
But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm a country-ass Beverly hill-billy
Eat it up bitch, I'ma meal ticket
Flush it down concert like fuck a ticket
Rich-ass, crazy-ass, super picky
Want a rich dick say I'm bucket listed
I don't fuck broke, I got a boujee dick
First round draft, I'm a lottery pick
Pepped up, East Atlanta vitamins shit
Solitaires glarin', big stone like Sharon
Superstar, Ed Sheeran, bitches love my earrings
Know she fucked wit him, I still fucked her
Fuck that nigga, he a real sucka
It's the Wiz and the Wizop
I baguetted my watch wit' real boogers

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Baby, I'm a rich-ass nigga, never said I was gon' be easy to deal with
But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit
Baby, I'm a rich-ass nigga, never said I was gon' be easy to deal with
But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit
