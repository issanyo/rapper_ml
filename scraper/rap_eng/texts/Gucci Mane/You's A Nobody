[Intro: Gucci Mane]
(Strange business)
If I put a hundred thousand in the Charger
Do that make me a moron?

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
If I drop a quarter million on the chain
Does that make me insane?
Drop a quarter million on the bracelet
Does that make me crazy?
If a drop a million dollars on the Bugatti (car)
Does that make me somebody? (stuntin')
You in the V.I.P. with me
Bitch, still you know you's a nobody
You's a nobody, you's a nobody
I don't know you, nigga, cause you's a nobody
You's a nobody, you's a nobody
You don't know me, nigga, you don't know nobody

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
If I gave a damn what people thought
I probably wouldn't have shit
Laughin' at the teacher
Cause she said I wouldn't amount to shit
Gamblin' for fifty cents, from fifty G's to fifty keys
2015, got the C like fifty M's on fifty M's
Fifty G's fifty shooters
Fifty niggas with a roogas [?]
Come by me and come by heli
Runnin' from the damn police
[?] cause I bet that they remember me
Red bottoms on the power knockers
Gucci Mane got stupid cheese
Yes I do shoot missiles ho
My pistol dismember folks
Hella lit November 4
By December damn, I'm broke
Times so hard, I thank the Lord
I'm richer than a year ago
That's your mouth and
That's your nose and
That's the route you chose to go

[Hook]
