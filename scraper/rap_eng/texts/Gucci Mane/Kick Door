[Hook: OJ Da Juiceman]
Trapping it into the bando
My .40 cal holds an extendo
Watch these niggas [?]
Pay a whole like we play Nintendo
I don't rock with nigga that my kin folk
These other niggas out here bitch doe
[?]
Pass it young nigga, kick door

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
We put lean in anything, Alka Seltzer, Dr. Pepper
20 ways you see me bling, its Mr. high and Dr. jumper
I'm on the [?]
Clean codeine I'm drinking lean
My daddy here just got some lean
[?]
Got a big bank roll, nigga no pressure
Got a bad bitch, [?]
Cocaina whipping out the nina
Walking out the bando and jumping in the beamer
If ya know that ya can surrender
Niggas refrain ya, niggas retain ya
[?]
We grew up in the East Atlanta
Colombian dough like I'm Tony Montana
[?]
Smoking on Cuban cigars like a banner
[?]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]
Young nigga do a kick door
[?]
Do hits on a nigga like I'm [?]
Smoking all the gas up in my castle
Me and my 2 young girls [?]
No pressure, ain't no hassle
These the same niggas that fuck with foot draggers
Later at the bando
[?]
Watch em for the pigs
On the roof they got some scammers
I just made a million
These niggas chain like they chameleon
All bout the bag baby I just want the millions
[?]
Still whipping babies, so I guess I'm selling children
Brand new coupe, call it [?]

[Hook]
