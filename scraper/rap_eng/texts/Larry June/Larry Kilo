Everything organic bitch
God damn
Shit

I paint a picture documentin' everything a nigga really doin'
If I die today I swear I'll be a legend never gave a fuck about the rules
Every other day i'm goin' through some shit
Buy another whip send another bitch
How you ballin' but your rolex tick?
Whip got no pink slips
Just bought a new condo by the whole foods with the white folk
I've touchin' hella bands, count a hunid' thousand with a fuckin' blindfold
At least I never fuckin' lie to 'em
You know I gotta keep it G
Finesse and capitalizin'
Betting bigger breads
Bitch I gotta eat
These niggas trappin' for a car, no
Then go to jail, and drop soul
Pussy nigga what you mad fo'?
I'm getting money dodgin' task force
Never ever had a rap deal
Everything I fuckin' grind fo'
20 bands on a rolex
Still got the fuckin' time roll
You be cooked caking with a bitch
Taking pictures at the inn car
You a twenty fifteen turn out
You never ever made no real dough
I'm on a plane I gotta do a show
All these rap niggas hella broke
I don't really give a fuck bro
Bounce out with the tool on me
I got bitches that are sayin' ho'
Stripper bitches boneified hoes
I'm so hi man my mind gone
Takin' chances hope I make it home
I had a dream that I lost it all
Then I woke up went extra hard
Oh my god, god damn

Tastemaker in this rap shit
Hundred thousand for a adlib
Money maker her do a backflip
I'm swaggin' on them rockin' ralf simmons
Plain hoodie its balenciaga
Larry June got swag
I'm the motherfuckin' man
(ey hold on sweetie, hand me that coffee please)
I might change my name to Pimp L
Weighin' Os on a digi-scale
Champagne, lost tail
Fuck it man, what the hell
2 spots, 2 whips
Cool lil' bitch
Hella ass on her
Bounce out any hood
I don't give a fuck bitch
I'm a real nigga
