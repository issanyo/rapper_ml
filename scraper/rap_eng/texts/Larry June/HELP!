[Intro]
Aye hold on bitch look, aye, aye, turn that muhfuckin light on nigga (Help!)
Aye, nah turn that muhfucka-, carry that muhfuckin HK out the kitchen bitch (Help!)
I be hearing the-, I think the walls talking (Goddamn!)

[Hook}
I'm crazy, I'm crazy
And I can't make my fucking mind up (Help!)
I'm crazy, I'm crazy
And I can't make my fucking mind up (Help!)

[Verse 1]
Fuck the motherfucking rules, bitch I rap bout' what I want (Yeehee!)
Mobbing in that low-key, dealer plates on the bumper (Good Job Larry!)
Fuck these maggot ass hoes I don't even want to touch em'
I might never sell a million but I keep this shit one hundred (Yes Lord!)
Don't give a fuck about rapping, bitch I do this shit for fun (aye, aye, aye)
Imma remain a real nigga, kept it G from the jump (Yeehee!)
Two hundred thousand dollars cash, I don't need nowhere to tuck it
When them packs touchdown, I don't even gotta touch it
I might pull up in the foreign, I might pull up in the bucket (Sock it to me!)
Either way I got that hammer like I'm trying to fix something
Are you bullshitting bitch?
Shut up hoe and roll something
Aye fuck the rap game nigga, Imma stay me for real that's on my mama (Goddamn!)

[Hook}
I'm crazy, I'm crazy
And I can't make my fucking mind up (Help!)
I'm crazy, I'm crazy
And I can't make my fucking mind up (Help!)

[Verse 2]
When you was going to class, I was on the interstate (Mob)
Copped them pills for two, and then I sold them hoes for eight
I'm in Pleasant Hill, I'm trapping out extended state (Trap)
Go to Costa Mesa, you can make a band today (Yeehee!)
Tysons Corner cracking, I just hit for 20k (aye, aye, aye)
My bottom bitch, I put her in a condo out the way (Good Job Bitch!)
Everything I got from motherfucking dedication (Sock it to me!)
Pull up in a Prius with a rose gold, catered
All my niggas winning, I don't know no haters
I gotta drive smooth cause my bro on papers (Be cool nigga!)
I smoke Backwoods and I smoke on papers
I ain't talking on no phone, I don't want no traces (Goddamn!)

[Hook}
I'm crazy, I'm crazy
And I can't make my fucking mind up (Help!)
I'm crazy, I'm crazy
And I can't make my fucking mind up (Help!)
