[Hook: Key Nyata]
Boy you smoking dirt (x4)
My niggas 'bout that high grade
My niggas got that high grade
My niggas 'bout that high grade
I been gone like all day

[Verse 1: Key Nyata]
My niggas got that high grade
I been high like all day
That's why a young nigga eyes glazed
Ya'll fuck niggas need to stay in yo place
I might take two blunts to the face
I might go crazy in this place
If a young nigga look me in my face
I might have to pull the thang and then spray
I be trying to keep things OK
But these young niggas love to play
I ain't even trippin' on nothing mane
I ain't even trippin' 'bout NOTHING mane
All these niggas just playing around
All these hoes just laying 'round
I'm trying to get my cash up
I'm trying to get my gold crown
Young nigga already run the town
Thraxxhouse, nigga it's goin' down
I'ma show up with real lean
I'ma show up with your girlfriend
And I came back, nigga swerved in
Came back, and I'm throwin money
Cause I just got off tour bitch

[Larry June]
Now hey hey, sweetheart
Don't just go that fast now
Sweetie, listen this is Thraxxhouse
OGG now, Yeah baby
Sock it to me
Do you understand sweetie, this could be life changing decision, now
Now, come here closer baby
Sock it to me!
Yeah baby

Boy you smoking dirt (x4)
My niggas 'bout that high grade
My niggas got that high grade
My niggas 'bout that high grade

[Verse 2: Larry June]
Aye, 22's on my grey coupe
God damn, everything coming steady
Had to hit the bitch, like, "Hold on
Why the fuck you smoking all that booboo lettuce?"
I'm fucking hoes playing R. Kelly
Now I believe that I can fly (Shit!)
Fuck the rap game
Everyday I'm outside (Aye)
Dropped outta school (Sock it to me)
Bought another tool (Yeah baby)
When you walk in, put it in my hand
Hoe, don't be rude (Yes Lord)
Now my shows overseas (God damn)
And my bitches is, too (Yee hee)
You sold dreams to the bitch (Aye Aye)
But they never came true (Shit!)
100 bales of that Arizona
Running through them like a marathon
How you get this fucking number, nigga?
Hang up, hit the trap phone
Did a jugg 'round three something
Bounced back with a 20 piece
Hopped out screaming Thraxxhouse
TFM, OGG (Yee Hee)

[Hook: Key Nyata]
Boy you smoking dirt (x4)
My niggas 'bout that high grade
My niggas got that high grade
My niggas 'bout that high grade
I been gone like all day
