[Intro]
Shit!
Aye Aye aye
Damn
Got damn
Yes lord
Sock it to me
Yeehee!

[Verse 1]
I don't save hoes, not a captain
Beat the pussy up I got it clappin
Bitch done fucked up my damn mattress
Versace covers bitch I'm really mackin
At the farmer's market strapped with the cannon
You never knowing when this shit could happen
I was playing the net you was playing Madden
Broke your baby mama for a hundred thousand
I know I hurt your feelings bruh my bad
You wanna beat the bitch up real bad
I serve them papers to him but he still calling
The bitch chose up now he hella mad
I'm in New York but I'll be gone tomorrow
All I know is ball, bitch I'm cashing out
She be like "I knew June when he was in high school"
Bitch shut the fuck up I'm balling now
Got a bad bitch making egg whites
Bitch looking like a Tommy Hil model
I just left the Bay, I'm on Fairfax
I'm finna take a job, she finna go tanning
She like why you never call
Aye sweetie, hand me that Palm Pilot please, thank you
I don't shop at malls (GOD DAMN)
(I don't shop at malls)

[Hook]
My cell phone ring
And I got the text
I just made a touch down
I just made a touch down
He told me it was good
Didn't need to know the rest
I just made a touch down
I just made a touch down
I done came up
I done came up
I done came up
I done came up
I done came up
I done came up

[Verse 2]
Choppa ringing like a doorbell
Pyrex got the coke smell
I hit the Henny then I fishtail
Then check my phone another brick sell
Fuck the bullshit bitch I got a type
I ain't just fucking anything
Baby I can get your credit right
Then put a Range Rover in your name
I'm a big tipper, Bimmer dipper
Everything organic got these niggas in they feelings
Got the ho the new Balenciaga's told the bitch you fucking with a real one
Two hoes took my bitches for a hike
We gon chill today but we gon trap tonight
Two bands for my Specialized bike
Eating sushi sipping fine wine
Crab meat in my wontons (scrumptious!)
Before I ate I had to hit the blunt
Swagger on a hundred million thousand
That's why these bitches steady choosing up
It's a nice day I took the bitch for lunch
Maybe your ex was, but I'm not in love
Bitch I got a plan, we can make some bands
Flip it to a million, god damn

[Hook]

Sock it to me!
Yeeeeeeheeeeee!
