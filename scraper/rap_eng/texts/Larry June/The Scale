[Verse 1]
Damnit they done hit the door it's 5 in the morning
I'm fresh out the pussy and a Nigga still yawning
Specolli hit my line said the label tryin ta sign me
I was whiping up a kick with a Bitch name Susie
On my, on my way to NYC, I just sent my ho to Boston
All my luggage, Louis V
I'm a mother fuckin baller
When I slide thru the score
I keep big .44 with the flash light on it like I'm tryna see something
Keep the battery acid in the trap case' I gotta dump it
Nigga you a cat run up on a nigga hit him with the strap
Snitch
Hiding in the burbs' nigga where you at?
Watch your feet on that rug ho I spent like five thousand

[Hook]
Aye, keep the scale in the kitchen
'Case the police raid

I'm just trying to get paid, bitch
Keep the scale in the kitchen, ho
Keep the scale in the kitchen, aye
Keep the scale in the kitchen
'Case the police raid

Mob to the rich I'm with coop he keep hammers
30 dick on it, man this life I live is savage
The bitch drive a jag, but that ho ain't got no money
A pimp like me a have that bitch living lovely
My bitches rock Rollie's and they got a thousand clutches
In the projects we keep the chopper by the bushes

[Hook]
Aye, keep the scale in the kitchen
