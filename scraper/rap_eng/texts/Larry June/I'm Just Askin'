[Verse 1]
I figured I could get it cheaper if I go and hit my plug out in Puerto Rico
Fifty cal desert eagle get to squeezing when a nigga feelin’ evil
Big smile on my face when I look over, see the trap phone ringing
Where was you nigga when I didn’t have shit, now you’re comin’ with opinions
I was taught growin’ up that I’d never have to answer to another nigga
I was taught growin’ up that you never roll with niggas that be in they feelings
Ups and downs in the trap game got me trappin’ hard, turned me to a menace
I’m vacayin’ on an island but my money still workin’ on the fucking west
I got two niggas, Smith and Wes’
I don’t give a fuck about a threat
Doin’ donuts in the ‘Vette
Yellow diamonds on my neck
Ride ‘round, mind gone, can’t even think, nigga too high
Two trap spots, two trap phones, goddamn, nigga too fly
I checked the mail like two times
Yeah I’m waiting on that pink slip
I hit the chopper with the rubber grip
Lately I been on some other shit
Damn

[Hook]
Sometimes I ask myself is this really living?
Is this real life? got a nigga trippin’
I’m just asking
I’m just asking
Sometimes I ask myself is this really living?
Is this real life? got a nigga trippin’
I’m just asking
I’m just asking

[Verse 2]
Riding by myself ‘cause I don’t trust niggas
Old hating ass nigga, I hope a bus hit ya
Dope man, dope man, got it for the cheaper
Chop down, chop down
Ride around with a MAC, gotta move different when you really havin’ money
Check that boy for a wire, nigga acting funny, nigga I don’t really trust him
Four five wrapped in a towel, had to grab mine, heard them niggas coming
FN with the skinny nose, got it sounding like a rock band drumming
I been out of my mind
Bae I gotta go now
I been working so hard
It’s all a nigga know now
Rocking Bally’s on my way to valley
Other bitch Italian, only feed her salad
On my way to Vegas, nigga fuck the mileage
Chopper break ya, sounding like you’re switching classes
I’m going steady so my check advancing
Organized crime got me living lavish
Overseas banking, got a few accountants
Put my bottom bitch in a new Audi
Triple eight white tee but that neck hit for like twenty-five thousand
Bounced out on a renegade like what’s up ma, need all of that

[Hook]
Sometimes I ask myself is this really living?
Is this real life? got a nigga trippin’
I’m just asking
I’m just asking
Sometimes I ask myself is this really living?
Is this real life? got a nigga trippin’
I’m just asking
I’m just asking
