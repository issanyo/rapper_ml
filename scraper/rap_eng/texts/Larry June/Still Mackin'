[Intro]
I'm still mackin'

[Verse 1: Larry June]
Hit it all night and then she cook a nigga breakfast
Turned my phone off for a second, no text message
Avocado, fresh omelette, lil' feta
I drop the top, bend a few corners, I'm just livin'
She said she wanna hit that bitch, I slide the stencil
One thing I never would do is fuck random women
Got her legs all on the sink, we in the kitchen
Damnit, love, you gotta be at work in ten minutes
I got two cellphones but she never ever trippin'
I'm a pimp/rapper, but with you I feel different
I got a five years old son, I'm always here when he need me
Through all the fucking bullshit my whips stay clean, nigga

[Hook: Larry June & Zacari]
She showed me I could love her, yeah (I'm still macking)
Yeah, oh
Give me some sugar, I'm your neighbour (I'm still macking)

[Verse 2: Larry June]
Damn babygirl, why you looking like that?
I never fall in love but you might just change that
Face on ten, and her ass so fat
I'm a grown man I ain't worry 'bout your past
Insecure niggas got you trippin'
You beautiful, don't let him tell you different
We can grab sushi on a wednesday
Then sunday you probably can get this dick
I'mma fly you out to the bay
I'mma show you how a nigga live
Maybe we should hit the golden gate
Or maybe we should just sip [?]
Hit a nigga [?]

[Hook: Larry June & Zacari]
She showed me I could love her, yeah (I'm still macking)
Yeah, oh
Give me some sugar, I'm your neighbour (I'm still macking)
