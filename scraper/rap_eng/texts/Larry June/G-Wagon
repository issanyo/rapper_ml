(Chorus)
Lately I been on some fly shit
I'm a hot topic
Smoking on some tropic
Dreaming of a g wagon
Like lil bih hop in
Had to get my dollas up and turn into the fucking man
I got my herb in the glove
My revolver a snub (Repeat)


(Verse 1)
I show to love to the thugs
Born n raised in pine hills, gotta rep where you from
You pick up and then you slide, I smoke joints with the plug
They say i been on my music shit, you sliding lil bruh
I'll school you niggas on game
You wanna make some paper?
You wanna fuck a model chick
And hit her friend later ?
Just observe how I swag, I might test you later
Don't need no drugs for these hoes, they just wanna lay up
Most of rappers out here junkies, I just had say it
Meanwhile i'm getting to some money, smoking weed im faded
You niggas looking jaded
Your corner looking shaded
My corner got that fragrance
That californiacation
It hit like penatration

(Chorus)
Lately I been on some fly shit
I'm hot topic
Smoking on some tropic
Dreaming of a g wagon
Like lil bih hop in
Had to get my dollas up and turn into the fucking man
I got my herb in the glove
My revolver a snub (Repeat)

(Verse 2)
Can you tell me what is rap beef?
I don't hop on wax if i don't keep the shit g
Gotta couple Niggas wit me but they staying lowkey
Im a young og,everybody know me
Taught ya mans bout his third eye
And got her smoking weed
I don't really like to drink, but the bottles on me
I done did it all in high school, sipping O.E
Spill a lil for my gs
That lost they life to the streets
Every morning gotta bless up
Grab my lighter off the dresser
Then go get my check up
I adapt just like water
You won't see me hiccup
You just a victim of some cadilatic pimpin
Im out the solar system
I'm fly but you just driftin

(Chorus)
Lately I been on some fly shit
I'm hot topic
Smoking on some tropic
Dreaming of a g wagon
Like lil bih hop in
Had to get my dollas up and turn into the fucking man
I got my herb in the glove
My revolver a snub (Repeat)
