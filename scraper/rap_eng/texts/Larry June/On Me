[Intro]
Off the dribble, you know what I'm sayin'?
Big Fiji waters and shit

[Chorus]
Nigga I'm on, nigga on me
Brand new pose, nigga on me
Brand new hoes, nigga on me
Brand new shows, nigga on me
Nigga off top, nigga on me
Serve another knot, nigga on me
Smokin' on the chop, nigga on me
Nigga on me, nigga on me
Nigga I'm on, nigga on me
Brand new pose, nigga on me
Brand new hoes, nigga on me
Brand new shows, nigga on me
Nigga off top, nigga on me
Serve another knot, nigga on me
Smokin' on the chop, nigga on me
Nigga on me, nigga on me

[Verse 1]
I feel John Madden
I'm pimpin', no cattin'
I'm lookin' for an Ashtyn
You nibblin' on pennies
Damnit I'm that nigga (goddamn)
Bitch I'm hella clean (sock it to me)
Goddamn (ayy ayy ayy, ayy ayy ayy)
I heard them niggas snitchin', had to hide the biscuit
Tuck the ammunition, everything efficient
Made the right choice, life's about decisions
Bought the bitch a hemi, you don't really hear me
Getting Jew like Jimmy, no gimmick
Butterfly crab legs, no lemon
Bitch talkin' 'bout kids then I'm dippin'
The neck was pretty lit but that's about it
Nekc in the house, neck in the whip
Neck in the kitchen, neck on the film
Neck on the first, neck on the sixth
Damn I never had no neck like this
Smokin' while I'm drivin', ticket for the tint, goddamn
Hopped in the whip, knocked another bitch, ooh-wee

[Chorus]
Nigga I'm on, nigga on me
Brand new pose, nigga on me
Brand new hoes, nigga on me
Brand new shows, nigga on me
Nigga off top, nigga on me
Serve another knot, nigga on me
Smokin' on the chop, nigga on me
Nigga on me, nigga on me
Nigga I'm on, nigga on me
Brand new pose, nigga on me
Brand new hoes, nigga on me
Brand new shows, nigga on me
Nigga off top, nigga on me
Serve another knot, nigga on me
Smokin' on the chop, nigga on me
Nigga on me, nigga on me

[Verse 2]
You pillow-talking to these bitches, need to stop it
On my way to Guatamala with my shottas
Dope dealers, killers, I was raised by 'em
Project nigga, never had a job
Free my niggas, fuck them niggas droppin' dimes
Fuck a -- bitch on Twitter tellin' lies
Fuckin' for some clout, bitch you out of line
Hit it from the back, grab that bitch a towel
I didn't think about it, I just got it now
Building cases, feds at the funeral
I got whips I ain't drove in awhile
Bought in cash case the trap slowed down
Got a couple hundred but I need a mill
Spot in Hollywood, one in Morgan Hills
Bitch you actin' funny, must be on the pill
Paris Hilton vodka, sodas on chill

[Chorus]
Nigga I'm on, nigga on me
Brand new pose, nigga on me
Brand new hoes, nigga on me
Brand new shows, nigga on me
Nigga off top, nigga on me
Serve another knot, nigga on me
Smokin' on the chop, nigga on me
Nigga on me, nigga on me
Nigga I'm on, nigga on me
Brand new pose, nigga on me
Brand new hoes, nigga on me
Brand new shows, nigga on me
Nigga off top, nigga on me
Serve another knot, nigga on me
Smokin' on the chop, nigga on me
Nigga on me, nigga on me

[Outro]
Nigga on me, nigga on me, nigga on me, nigga on me
Nigga on me, nigga on me, nigga on me, nigga on me
Nigga on me, nigga on me, nigga on me, nigga on me
Nigga on me
