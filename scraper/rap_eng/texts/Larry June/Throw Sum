[Intro: Ye Ali]
When you gon' throw somethin'? (throw it, throw)
Girl you goddamn, you tryna know somethin'? (tryna know)
Do you got a man? I'm tryna know somethin' (gotta know)
We should leave this club, I'm tryna go somewhere (tryna go)

[Chorus: Ye Ali]
Do you got a man? I'm tryna know somethin' (gotta know)
We should leave this club, I'm tryna go somewhere (tryna go)
Girl I got them papers, we can roll somewhere (tryna roll)
You got all that ass, when you gon' throw somethin'? (throw it for)
Yeah, you got all that ass, when you gon' throw somethin'? (throw somethin')
You got all that ass, when you gon' throw somethin'? (throw somethin')
You got all that ass, when you gon' throw somethin'? (throw somethin')

Throw it, throw it for me
Throw it, throw it for me
Throw it, throw it for me
Ayy, yeah-eah-eah-eah

[Verse 1: Larry June]
Shake it one time, bend that ass over
Lookin' so scrumptious, man, damn I want to hold it
Left cheek workin', right cheek workin' (woo)
You're doing good, bitch keep twerking
What you drinkin' on? ayy, order two of those
Damn, baby goin' crazy, damn she a pro (what she do?)
Upside down bitch on the pole
Certified money maker, she go
Cashed out for the night, brought it home
Off to Las Vegas with the rhino

[Chorus: Ye Ali & Larry June]
Do you got a man? I'm tryna know somethin' (gotta know)
We should leave this club, I'm tryna go somewhere (tryna go)

You got all that ass, when you gon' throw somethin'? (throw it for)
Yeah, you got all that ass, when you gon' throw somethin'? (throw somethin')
You got all that ass, when you gon' throw somethin'? (throw somethin')
You got all that ass, when you gon' throw somethin'? (throw somethin')
You got all that ass, when you gon' throw somethin'? (throw it, throw it for me)
Throw it, throw it for me (yes lawd)

[Verse 2: Larry June]
You lookin' like a model, know tonight you made a lot of
She twerkin' so good, made the trick buy her an Audi (twerk)
She said she goin' vegan and she love goin' hiking
And every Friday a new trick will take her shopping, yeah (ayy)
So much ass that it's payin' all her bills (ayy)
New designer bag match her new designer heels (ayy)
Order more rounds, I need bottles of that Priv (ayy)
I need it right now, bitch thick like Trina
I'm in DC (yeehee), at the Camelot (shit)
New lil bitch, and she make a lot (ayy)
Whip in the spot, she hit for a Yacht
Ain't talkin' 'bout a yacht, I'm talkin' Rollie watch
She gon' make a nigga spend some dough on it (damn, ayy ayy ayy)
Doin' all the moves on the pole with it (yeehee)
Left cheek workin', right cheek workin'
You're doing good, bitch keep twerkin'
