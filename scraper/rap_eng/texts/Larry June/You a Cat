[Intro]
Shit, damn, god
Good job Sledgren
Ayy ayy ayy, yeehee
Shit, damn, bop bop bop, ayy
Goddamn, sock it to me, yeah baby

[Verse 1]
Throwaway MAC-10 with the shoelace on it
Knocked a bad lil bitch, cute face, big booty, blew some bands on her
What you niggas want to do?
Take the brick, chop it screw it on some Texas shit?
Threw my phone out the window
I was hearin' shit, I ain't wanna take a risk
Buy it for the low, sell it for a good price
I'll show you how to win
My young nigga told me that they snitchin' so I'm out the way with my other bitch
My hands dirty, AK47 gunpowder on my burner gloves
Her daddy trippin', stressin' out
Oh my god my baby fell in love with a thug
I don't give a fuck about the hate
Pillow talkin' niggas hella fake
Ayy tell a nigga what the motive was
I still got the ho anyway
Niggas always got some shit to say
I go to Barneys and they know my name
Canary yellow diamonds on the chain
I do Celine, yeah designer frames
Goddamn, shit

[Chorus]
Flexin' hard, like you ballin', nigga you a cat
Pillow talkin', to these hoes, nigga you a cat
You a house nigga talkin' 'bout you need the strap
Nigga you a cat
Hit my phone talkin' 'bout do I need the pack?
Nigga you a cat
I-I-I been goin' through some motherfuckin' shit
I-I-I will never ever trust a punk bitch
I-I keep thirty in my motherfuckin' clip
I got money, I got hoes, I'm the shit
(Goddamn, sock it to me, yeah baby) damn

[Verse 2]
Range Rover coaster, four-five toter
Plain jane Rollie, goddamn
Slide through the block bustin' hell knots
Gettin' top like a ceiling fan
Grow opp out the weights only
Goin' hard, got it for the wholesale
It's going down at the candy house
We got nachos and the fishscale
I'm a motherfuckin' mack, I might never text you back
(Hold on sweetie, I'm busy now)
I heard you fell in love with her, goddamn, you're doing bad
It's sounding like a rock band, I hope the FN never jam
I'm a real Fresco nigga, slide through, it really goes down
Niggas talk a lot, I don't talk at all
You can have the bitch, I don't want the broad
All I know is ball, Chevy sitting tall
I'm on an interview layin' down the law
Ho I need it all, post another ad
Cash a nigga out, then maybe we can talk
Got my money right and bought another loft
Goddamn, shit, yeehee

[Interlude]
Ayy what's happenin' bitch nigga
Heard you niggas travelin' round the world nigga
Trickin' off on a bitch nigga
What's your motherfuckin' ROI nigga?
What's your motherfuckin' return on investment ho?
Get your motherfuckin' money up nigga
Yeehee, shit, goddamn, yeehee, ayy

[Chorus]
Flexin' hard, like you ballin', nigga you a cat
Pillow talkin', to these hoes, nigga you a cat
You a house nigga talkin' 'bout you need the strap
Nigga you a cat
Hit my phone talkin' 'bout do I need the pack?
Nigga you a cat
I-I-I been goin' through some motherfuckin' shit
I-I-I will never ever trust a punk bitch
I-I keep thirty in my motherfuckin' clip
I got money, I got hoes, I'm the shit
(Goddamn, sock it to me, yeah baby) damn
