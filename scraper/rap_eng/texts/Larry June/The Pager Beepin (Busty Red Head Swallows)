[Verse 1]
Pull up out the shop
Goddamn
Making money on the corner sack
Chop it up and then we throw it back
Couple bands but I'm gain it back
No diamonds on my wrist bitch
Don't give me no chain
No fashion nigga that triple six
Murder running through my brain
Gimme the strength and I'll [?]
Fucking the game
And I'm taking it over
[?] on with that turf phone
Place your order then get gone
Caught cases
Probation
Sit in the dark and I'm praying to Satan
Flashing your money your wallet am taking
Bumpin my shit while your bitch masturbating

[Hook]
Wrist Wrist Wrist
Cuff yo bitch
Come through sit
Making money quick
I need the type of bitch
Attend her with the shits
Goddamn my man
I fuck around cus ain't nothing [?]
Goddamn

[Verse 2]
Triple six bought a brick
Double up bought a benz
Goddamn
All my niggas money flipping moving with precision
Fuck a pig
All black masked up M-80 with the wood grain
Beamer coupe with the red guts looking like Suge came
Ragtop only got to pull up loaded
Zipping on it
Cus you know I never supplied nothing
Cus your ten piece saw me chain working
Twenty shy on it
Fuck bitch blew bounce back with two fuck the bitch
Fag in the club with two boat selling
Right I'm tripping
Now the bitch got a little [?]
Pepper in my flesh
Shot up off finesse
Haters playing checkers but it's really chess
Like a college nigga in the A-Town
Slide through hit a nigga with the tech
Money and the power
Bound to get respect
I've been Paranoid
Went and bought a vest
Shawty made a mess
Gotta clean it up
Grab a bite to eat
Then I bought the Jag
Goddamn
