[Intro - TYus]
Don't be scared, need you here right by my side
Don't be scared

[Verse 1 -  Larry June]
You looking like something off the magazine
Can I touch it?
Can I feel it?
You make a nigga wanna
Uh uh uuh uh uh uuh
You make a nigga wanna
Uh uh uuh uh uh uuh
She said she [?] so I took her out to sushi
I met her on a Saturday around two what it do
Pretty brown round thang
I'm trynna see what it do
Maybe we can go hiking when I'm done the stu
Naw fuck that baby hit a addy slide through
I got HBO now we can chill and watch [?]
But before that I'ma make you a fresh juice
And I ain't hit it yet but you gon love me when I do

[Chorus - TYus]
Tell me you love yeah
Just tell me you love me, what you got to lose
You make a nigga wanna fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love

[Verse 2 - Larry June]
You know that thang good when you let her stay the night
Woke up in the morning then I took her out biking
She love the song ninety nine with me and 305
I could've been famous but I never truly tried
I know you like my style I can see it in your eyes
I gotta get my brakes fixed in the morning you can slide
I got a couple [?] maybe I'll scoop you round nine
Maybe we can hit malibu and get a lil massage
Man a girl like you I might wife
Coz I never really truly met a better uh in my life
You take away
You take away my pain
Damn life been gucci so today I might [?] shit
You never really know life is like a box of chocolates
When you getting money then you be the main topic
Would you stick around baby if I had nothing
You must know somebody coz this party's so private
You got me wide open baby I can't even hide it
A lil orange juice and   champagne when I'm on an island
Get off the road I can make that happen
I got one bedroom soon it's gon be mansion
I live in California baby rent way up in the thousands
One day I'ma have that big house in the mountains
Front yard with fountain only open to the family

[Chorus]
Tell me can we go there
Don't be scared, need you here right by my side
Tell me can we go there
Don't be scared, need you here right by my side
Tell me can we go there
What you got to lose
Tell me you love
Just tell me you love me
What you got to lose
You make a nigga wanna fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love
Why don't I love you
Why don't I love you
Why don't I love you the way that I should
Why don't I love you
Why don't I love you
Why don't I love you the way that I should
You take away
You take away my pain
Why do I love you
Why do I feel for you
Tell me
