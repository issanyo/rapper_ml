[Verse 1: J $tash]
Close that door
I fucked your hoe
She want to go I'm my lambo
I told her no, give me deepthroat
She was so stoned, high off the coke
Leave me alone, just popped 'em both
Eh close that door, we 'bout to smoke
I fucked your bitch then I pass
Smoking that gas getting cash
Got on my Gucci Duurag
Hold up baby girl relax
Bitches they loving J. $tash, play these hoes just like tag
Tokyo riding the Jag
[?] making you say, and my bitch she is bad
Love the kid just like her dad
Love when she grab on my ball when I hit from the back
I be all up in the trap, moving them packs
Selling then lean and got wax
Random niggas getting taxed
Homie that's facts, close that door bitch eh relax

[Hook]
Close that door, ehh (x8)
I'm selling dope, ehh
Close that door, ehh
She gunna go, ehh
Close that door, ehh

[Verse 2: Larry June]
Whip the yolo till my hand hurt
Put her on the blade, leg work
Fucking hoes, playing new edition
Baby show me how that head work
It's like gymnastics how I'm flipping money
Close the door I think the feds lurking
Got my credit up A1, you niggas still balling True Religion
Bitches nagging, I'm on kawasaki smashing
I'm in Miami on Colins stuck in traffic
Never truly solo, riding with the wammy
Bitch you out of pocket I won't tell yo' daddy
Socket to my pocket
Keep me living lavish
If I really want it
I can make it happen
I'ma need ten before I sign the papers
A hundred in the stash put eighty up
Play around with twenty, then I double up
I'm a real nigga I can run it up
I'm mobbin' solo cause these niggas dumb as fuck
God damn

[Outro]
Close that door, ehh (x7)
I'm selling dope, ehh
She wanna go, ehh
