[Intro: Larry June]

[Verse 1: Larry June]
Took a bad bitch shopping I was feeling good today
Copped the Chinese chopper, had to use it yesterday
Eating pho with my niggas, rice, noodles, and the steak
If this lick go good, my whole crew'll be straight
Why these niggas wanna hate? I just checked another eight
Bitch we eating hella good, maybe you should get a plate
Do the lobster and the steak, old school on 28s
All I do is count money, designer shades on my face
Thank God for the trap, 20 bands on my lap
She only knew me as a pimp, she was surprised that I rap
I don't need a record deal, bitch I need another strap
Wake up early, take my vitamins, and blow another rack

[Hook: Larry June]
They done fucked around and let me in the rap game
I treat the rap game just like the trap game
I was so excited when them fucking packs came
I treat the rap game just like the trap game


[Verse 2: Larry June]
Don't hit my phone on no motherfucking holiday
If you wouldn't hit my phone on no fucking normal day
Loading up the chopper, ammunition unlimited
.223, God damn. Oooh wee. Aye
Paper stacking gun clapping niggas at the cinematic
Take the money then I'm bouncing like a mattress
Never bring a punk bitch to the palace
If I really wanted could've been had it
See a nigga winning, now they swagger jacking
I'm the realest nigga point period, know they wanna rob me but it never happen
Hit a nigga on his trap phone
Twelve hours on the interstate
Giving rap niggas platforms
When I re-up make the block shake
Went up for it, then I pump faked
Had to throw these little niggas off
Choosy Susie, had to cut her off
Faggot bitch, playing with a boss
I don't give a fuck about the cost
Remember days I was dead broke
Damn, I didn't have nobody
Man now these niggas want a free verse
Everyday I'm in the trap serving
Tell me what you need
But I'ma need a fee. Ain't shit free

[Hook: Larry June]
They done fucked around and let me in the rap game
I treat the rap game just like the trap game
I was so excited when them fucking packs came
I treat the rap game just like the trap game

[Outro:
Aye, check it out nigga though, nigga look, 100 though
I might quit rapping today, nigga
I'd rather go fishing, nigga look
Aye check it out, God damn, sock it to me
Now listen here sweetie
Do you understand now?
Look, fuck the motherfucking rap game nigga
Realest nigga in this shit,nigga straight up nigga
I'm at motherfucking Whole Foods getting my motherfucking vitamins and orange juice, nigga
I gotta stay healthy on a punk bitch doe
God damn, sock it to me
Yee Hee, aye aye
Look, check it out
