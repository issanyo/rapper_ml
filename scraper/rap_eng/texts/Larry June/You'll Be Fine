You'll be fine
You're doing good
You'll be fine

[Verse 1]
On the beach with two freaks white bitch double D's God damn
Other phone ringing, bitch catting off
Gotta break her for another hundred thou
I hit the blunt, then I'm back to trapping
My left wrist, made it happen
Started with a Cadi'
Now I got the Beamer coupe matted
(Aye sweetie hand me that Louie bag please)
At 16, man I had a vision
Break a bitch for her fucking dope
Buy a Range Rover on 4s
In Arizona eating Lo-Lo's
Back then I had no shows
But God damn I had a lot of hoes
I probably fucked your main bitch
But you would never know she got another phone
Eating pho, gotta cheat, Cheerios, Netflix, Sunday
God damn, a nigga too on
You probably thought I was a dumb nigga
Finessed the whole fucking rap game
I don't even fucking drive no more
Got my Indian for that
I don't talk on the phone no more
Got another bitch for that

[Hook]
You're doing good
You'll be fine
You're doing good
You'll be fine
You're doing good

[Verse 2]
On the phone with my accountant, maybe I should buy a yacht
Blueberry muffins in the morning with my new thot
Bout to buy a new drop
$400 for the Saint Laurent shades on my face
Chillin in the shade, getting blazed
God damn, Glock 40, no aim, aye aye aye aye
Had a loss, bounced back
Got it back again, all my niggas winning
#OGG, 23, Jordan to the rap game, fuck nigga
I'm on my way to Asia, [?] chillin
What the fuck I'm doing here? I'm the only nigga
They thought I played basketball or something
Riding around in the old school
You only ballin' on Pro Tools
House nigga, you fell in love with your prostitute, fuck nigga
I got no worries, I'm in the trap making pancakes
Every day, bitch it's pay day
I'm 100 like the clip on my AK
God damn

[Hook]
You're doing good
You'll be fine
You're doing good
You'll be fine
You're doing good
