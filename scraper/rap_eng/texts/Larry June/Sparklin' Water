[Verse 1: Zacari]
You one of a kind girl
And I hate to see you working so damn hard
But could you take the rest of the night off baby
Come to my loft, ay
Get your money right, girl
That's alright, girl
Nobody can tell you shit
You gon' get it [?]
[?]
[?]

[Hook: Zacari]
Oh baby what it do?
I wanna show you the finer things
We can sip champagne [?]
Oh baby what it do?
Whenever you want it, babe
I'll show you better things
Oh baby what it do?
Go ahead and make that thing [?]
Sit it on my lap, girl
Oh baby what it do?
So bring that ass over here and show me just what it do, girl

[Verse 2: Larry June]
I drop my top on that matte white beamer
You ain't gotta trip, I'm not your last nigga
Two bottles of Crystal, today we just chillin'
Postmates and sushi, then that dick all in it
You lookin' like some work so I just thought I would ask you
Is it another nigga in that phone that you answer to
I ain't even trippin', you the one (I ain't mad at you)
Just keep it one hundred like my favorite dollar bill
This remind me of them days when I lived in the eighth
I wonder how my life would be if I didn't leave and I stayed
One thing I can promise is: Shit won't change
If they send me up state is you [?]
Let's go hiking in the morning, the mo' early the better
I never gossip 'bout a nigga, that ain't playa
You just throw that thing back and I'm gon' grip yo' hair
You say you looking for a daddy well this him right here

[Hook: Zacari]
Oh baby what it do?
I wanna show you the finer things
We can sip champagne [?]
Oh baby what it do?
Whenever you want it, babe
I'll show you better things
Oh baby what it do?
Go ahead and make that thing clap, girl
Sit it on my lap, girl
Oh baby what it do?
So bring that ass over here and show me just what it do, girl

[Verse 3: Larry June]
Champagne and lemonade, that's what I'm sippin' on
Caught the flight with no shoes
Damnit love, you so cute
When I see you I get in the mood
Work her vocals like pro tools
Gotta study in that high note
Oh you in love with yo' new nigga?
Well why you blowin' up my line for?
I know you miss how I throw that
She fall asleep in my throwbacks
I got her rockin' Frisco hats
I know you kinda want yo' girl back
I'm just livin', I ain't really trippin'
So I ain't really focused on no other women
I gotta hit the road, baby hold me down
Answer a nigga phone when I'm outta town

[Hook: Zacari]
Oh baby what it do?
I wanna show you the finer things
We can sip champagne [?]
Oh baby what it do?
Whenever you want it, babe
I'll show you better things
Oh baby what it do?
Go ahead and make that thing [?]
Sit it on my lap, girl
Oh baby what it do?
So bring that ass over here and show me just what it do, girl
