[Intro:Larry June]

Goddamn!

Sock it to me!
Aye!
YeeHee!


[Hook:Larry June]

Automatics with the mothafuckin grip on it
Only do the Glock 40 if the stick on it
I got trust issues
I don't trust you. I don't trust you
Automatics with the mothafuckin grip on it
Only do the Glock 40 if the stick on it
I got trust issues
I don't trust you. Not at all


[Verse 1:Larry June]

I'm paranoid. Trippin. They done took my trap phone
Big MAC-10 with the shoe lace on it
In the scrape thang with my young niggas blowin
Punk bitch shut up and go get it like I told you
How you flippin packs, but you livin with yo momma?
I bought my bitch Chanel cuz she kept that shit one hunnid
The money keep comin. I ain't trippin. Bitch run it
Yeah it's just a t-shirt, but I spent eleven hunnid
Nigga fuck a show. I don't wanna go. I talk dollar signs
Aye Miss Choosey Susie you've been late to calls. There's gon be fine
I might never answer, but I'll text you back. Don't be greedy now
When I touch a million, I might calm it down, but I highly doubt it

Automatics with the mothafuckin grip on it
Only do the Glock 40 if the stick on it
I got trust issues
I don't trust you. I don't trust you
Automatics with the mothafuckin grip on it
Only do the Glock 40 if the stick on it
I got trust issues
I don't trust you. Not at all


[Verse 2:Larry June]

I ain't hangin in no studio. I rather chill with bitches
Count a hundred thousand dollars. Bitch I'm really bout my business
Like a bad black bitch, man my 40 got extensions
Hangin at the car lot like "decisions, decisions."
Got my bitches eating healthy. It's a nice day to mob
I just knocked a model bitch, but I'm not gon talk about it
Sippin liquor got a nigga wildin
???? got a nigga noddin
Sit her down and give the bitch some knowledge
Boss nigga. Never been to college
But I really came from the bottom
Used to roll with niggas movin Miley Cyrus
Finessed the whole fuckin rap game
Fuck the rap game. Bitch I need the gualla
Tote a automatic. Thirty round magulator
Nigga have it. Aye! Aye!
I don't need a codefendant
Do it by myself
Let the 40 spray, spray, spray


[Hook:Larry June]

Automatics with the mothafuckin grip on it
Only do the Glock 40 if the stick on it
I got trust issues
I don't trust you. I don't trust you
Automatics with the mothafuckin grip on it
Only do the Glock 40 if the stick on it
I got trust issues
I don't trust you. Not at all
