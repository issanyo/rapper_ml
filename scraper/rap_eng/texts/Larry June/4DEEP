[Intro]
Ay, turn me up
Yeah, that is perfect, yup, damn, ay
Hold on, hold on
You know what, keep it going
I'mma go right here

[Verse 1]
I pimp and I rap, drive a Benz not a Lac
Two twelves in the back when I'm mobbin'
Grab a eighth for the purp, fresh white t-shirt
No L's but a young nigga slidin'
Got a bitch out the way, brand wood to be exact
Sucking dick like the bitch still in college
Don't make me take it back to '07, bitch nigga
Black hoodie with the chinese chop
Don't gimme no motherfuckin bammer bitch nigga
In the 415, that's a problem
Got a bitch in the eighth, hella bad
And she think that she make a real good peach cobbler
Got her trappin' in the city, San Bruno Bayhill
First game so I treat her like a starter
Got her first Louis bag, now the bitch going hard
Now the ho ridin' round in a Maserati

[Hook]
4DEEP, ay, 4DEEP no sleep, nigga, 4DEEP no
4DEEP, ay, 4DEEP no sleep, nigga, 4DEEP no
4DEEP, ay, 4DEEP no sleep, nigga, 4DEEP no
4DEEP, ay, 4DEEP no sleep, nigga, 4DEEP no, 4DEEP

[Verse 2]
Got a bitch out in Philly, got a bitch out in Vegas
If they both do good that's at least 3k
Nigga I been havin' hoes, nigga since MySpace
Used to mob to the V, me and Nemo [?]
Now they got me all in double XL, shit crazy
Nigga had to change his life, fucked around and had a baby
It was 9th grade when I bought my first .38
I was a new nigga and I heard them boys was tryna play
Got my first lil' bitch named Tina, she was asian
She chose up in the Rich, I was fresh out to blaze
Right by the taco shop at the MetroPCS
I was still sellin' zips, she was dressed in the best
I ain't have a whip, young nigga from the 'jects
Big Brad, T-Wood taught me how to bust a TEC
Now a nigga twenty-five, and your boy livin' good
Hit my nigga Lil Yee slide through and blow a wood

[Hook]
4DEEP, ay, 4DEEP no sleep, nigga, 4DEEP no
4DEEP, ay, 4DEEP no sleep, nigga, 4DEEP no
4DEEP, ay, 4DEEP no sleep, nigga, 4DEEP no
4DEEP, ay, 4DEEP no sleep, nigga, 4DEEP no, 4DEEP
