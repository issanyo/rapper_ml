[Verse 1]
The pump squeeze make a bad debris
My new bag from a overseas magazine
I painted a candid dream from a can of peas
Any man could plant a seed, take the real man and feed
Stampedin' on this fake lean
We was gettin' it out the pot like some baked beans
China White by the block, call it Beijing
I'm the 'Pac, Biggie, Jay-Z, I'm the AP's (Larry makin' all the hits)
Niggas ride clean like, I needa make eighteen
No I.D., just a baby and a lemon squeeze
Blue hunnid remedies, lookin' like I made it
Thousand dollar jeans and my jersey outdated
Room with free service can't escape [?]
Shit, I know that nigga nervous when I word, hit them cages
Stuck swingin' in between unity and egos
I watch to see the change, but who they switched on me for?
Court room [?], war wounded heroes
Fresh off the fuck truck 'fore I slid a kilo
I done bitten bit the bullet, bounce back and went beast mode
Fell up in a hard summer, then I had a heat stroke
Twenty four feet Forgiato, no lipper
That's that new edition and body after the split up
All up in the Villas, this that Athens to the Millers
In the laundry mat, where [?] surpass the ceilin'
You never catch a nigga broke

[Hook]
I know you want me broke (I know you niggas want me broke, I know you niggas want me broke)
Oou, want a nigga broke (I know you niggas want me broke)
You want me comin' up short (I know you niggas want me broke)
You want me comin' up short (I know you niggas want me broke)
I know you niggas want to
'Cause you see us doin' what we want to (I ain't comin' up short)
I know bein' broke is what I won't do (I know you want a nigga broke)
I'mma keep on doin' what I want to (I know you niggas want me broke)
I know you want me broke (I know)
I know that's what you want too
'Cause you see us doin' what we want to (I know you niggas want me broke)
I know bein' broke is what I won't do
I'mma keep on doin' what I want to (I know you niggas want me broke) [I know]

[Verse 2]
I know you want me broke, keep the hope alive
They give me quarters for a quote, this a coin toss
Tryna blow [?]
Niggas throwin' Johnny K shade, let the boy pop
Let that boy E get his boys involved
I don't really speak let the Forbes talk
Traded war stories I'm 'bout to run off
Ballin' this a sport for me
Look and if you hang when I broke niggas, you the tenth one
I can tell a broke muh'fucker 'cause I been one
I done sold dope, stole clothes, nigga then some
Now crouchin' outta foreign, go get one
Tellin' me that money is the root of all evil
I done killed hunnids for a flock of bald eagles
Lemme pass a couple more times, we goin' legal
I been breakin' colour lines with these blue people

[Pre-Hook]
You just want me broke (yeah, I know)
You say I'm livin' up short (say no more)
'Cause On My Momma I'm On (free my folks)
We got a lot lately, I've been gettin' [?] with open road

[Hook]
I know you want me broke (I know you niggas want me broke, I know you niggas want me broke)
Oou, want a nigga broke (I know you niggas want me broke)
You want me comin' up short (I know you niggas want me broke)
You want me comin' up short (I know you niggas want me broke)
I know you niggas want to
'Cause you see us doin' what we want to (I ain't comin' up short)
I know bein' broke is what I won't do (I know you want a nigga broke)
I'mma keep on doin' what I want to (I know you niggas want me broke)
I know you want me broke (I know)
I know that's what you want too
'Cause you see us doin' what we want to (I know you niggas want me broke)
I know bein' broke is what I won't do
I'mma keep on doin' what I want to (I know you niggas want me broke) [I know]
