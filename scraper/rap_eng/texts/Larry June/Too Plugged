[Chorus: Derek Pope]
Frosted, sweet high
Don't leave that door open
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged
Gardens, green lights
Keep my eyes from closing
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged

[Verse 1: Larry June]
Way too damn plugged
Fucked the bitch on a twenty-thousand dollar fuckin' rug
All my whips got pink slips (good job Larry)
Thank you sweetie
Gettin' head in a king sized motherfuckin' tub (help)
I'm going hard, can't stop, beast mode
Left wrist playing hockey, freeze mode
Orange crush, bust down D's on it
Step it up and buy a house in Barcelona
Half a million tucked, I might never touch it
Got 'em swagger jacking, think I'm on to something
Why you handcuffing, get your bands up
Serving J's out the Uber black truck
Smoke so much weed, one lung
Compact sounding like a bass drum
On a bitch head like a lacefront
Go'n bend it over bitch, shake some'
Louis V for the bitch birthday
Handmade lemonade, cost eight
Specialized bike cost thirty-eight
Hittin' wheelies while I cross the Golden Gate, damn, ayy ayy ayy

[Chorus: Derek Pope]
Frosted, sweet high
Don't leave that door open
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged
Gardens, green lights
Keep my eyes from closing
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged

[Verse 2: Derek Pope]
In a heartbeat, flat the carseat
She so artsy, take my sharpie
New connect, too connected
Lethal weapon, don't get reckless
Warm up, winter fit
Dive in the deep but don't sink in it
Play for my teammates to benefit
That's how you know this shit genuine
Flyer than fly and I'm wingin' it
Eye in the sky got me seeing shit
Plug'll pull up in that dealership
Push button still got a key in it (woah)
I can say, for six days
I saw lines, Chic-Fil-A
Roll my vines, keep my mind, in its place
I'm too fade (I'm too fade), just the face (just want face)
Flower eighth, treat that backwood like a vase

[Chorus: Derek Pope]
Frosted, sweet high
Don't leave that door open
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged
Gardens, green lights
Keep my eyes from closing
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged
I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged, I'm too plugged

[Outro: Derek Pope]
Ooh, I'm too plugged in
Need my dopamine
Demons taking over me, ooh
Lord I pray there's hope for me
