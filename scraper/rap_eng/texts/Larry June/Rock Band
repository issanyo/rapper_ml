[Intro]
Ayy look, check it out though, look, ayy look
Bitch make me two motherfuckin' over easy eggs
Nigga some motherfuckin' fresh toast, you know what I'm sayin'
And a motherfuckin' fresh squeezed orange juice
Bitch I swear to god, sock it to me, good job Sledgren
Yeehee

[Chorus]
Chopper sounding like a rock band, damn, ayy, god
Made a million dollars off one hand, whip, whip, whip
Chopper sounding like a rock band, goddamn, sock it to me, yeehee
Made a million dollars off one hand, goddamn, ayy, whip
Whip whip whip

[Interlude]
Ayy what's happenin' bitch ass nigga
I got the lil fuckin' Asian bitch giving me a manicure and a pedicure as we speak nigga, we in the booth nigga
That's real pimp shit nigga
Bitch nigga get your motherfuckin' money up

[Verse 1]
They swagger jacking goddamn, get your money up, ayy
Hundred bales, put it in a black truck, uhh, damn
Off beat, off beat, off beat (off beat nigga fuck the rap game nigga)
Why these niggas tryna rap like me? shit, damn
Send a pack to the bando, trappin' off the motherfuckin' payphone
You ain't really pimping, heard you riding 'round town with the fuckin' cape on
Take it out the pot, sell it while it's wet
Go'n leave a little weight on it
Bend the corner slow, aim it out the window, goddamn

[Chorus]
Chopper sounding like a rock band, damn, ayy, god
Made a million dollars off one hand, whip, whip, whip
Chopper sounding like a rock band, goddamn, sock it to me, yeehee
Made a million dollars off one hand, goddamn, ayy, whip
Whip whip whip

[Verse 2]
Louis V backpack, twenty-five hundred, fill it up with hunduns
Knock her out her pocket, ho tell her put an eighth in the fuckin' backwood
You the type of nigga ridin' 'round clean, but you always get your pack took
Flippin' work like a MacBook, thirty clip with the MAC tucked
It ain't breakfast time but I got the biscuit
Too much clientele, need a bigger kitchen
Bitch I'm on a mission, but I'm not religious
Goddamn, keep going Larry
I need a documentary, my life a motion picture
Mobbin' blowin' Keisha, damn damn damn
Hoes out in Phoenix, got 'em playing Jesus
Check my background, real street nigga, god

[Chorus]
Chopper sounding like a rock band, damn, ayy, god
Made a million dollars off one hand, whip, whip, whip
Chopper sounding like a rock band, goddamn, sock it to me, yeehee
Made a million dollars off one hand, goddamn, ayy, whip
Whip whip whip
