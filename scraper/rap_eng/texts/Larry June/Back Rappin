[Verse 1]
Bitch hit for 10, bought a mac
Tried to quit pimping, but I'm back
50 niggas gunned down in Vegas
Bitch nigga fucking up the trap
Word around my hood I got A-1
Moved back to the city and bought eight guns
I'm a real nigga, I ain't gotta front
I'm a real nigga, I ain't gotta front
I never post my bitch on the net
Unless its bout a motherfucking check
I told the punk bitch I'm the catch
But I fell in love with the neck
My niggas said its hoes on the Tinder
But I don't need tinder to get her
New Asian bitch and she thicker
You got the pussy, but she made me richer
Twenty-two sliding up the blade
I ain't got no real sleep in days
Third day, 6K
Fifth day, out the way

[Chorus]
I been trappin, rap been slow
Trap been poppin
Rap been slow
Blue hunnits, going through the pain
I don't wanna sell dope, but this all a nigga know
Choose up, bitch we can win
Yeah a nigga fell off, but I bounced back again
Off top smoking weed, sipping on Henn
Bitch you want a square nigga hoe, but I'm not him

[Verse 2]
Damn that's a big bitch, but she run it up
AR-15 for your runners up
Bought a Balmain hoodie, and I wore it once
Bought a Balmain hoodie, and I wore it once
Sliding through the 'jects, new tech, new feet
Young nigga [?], still crack a nigga bitch
Fuck a record deal nigga, made more off pimping
Fuck the rap game nigga, I'm just talking how i'm living
Sipping champagne in the hot tub with my bitch
I don't know I just love a thick bitch that can strip
10 bands in my pocket got me walking with a limp
Bought a brand new Glock with a see-through clip

[Chorus]
I been trappin, rap been slow
Trap been poppin
Rap been slow
Blue hunnits, going through the pain
I don't wanna sell dope, but this all a nigga know
Choose up, bitch we can win
Yeah a nigga fell off, but I bounced back again
Off top smoking weed, sipping on Henn
Bitch you want a square nigga hoe, but I'm not him
