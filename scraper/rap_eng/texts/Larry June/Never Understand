[Intro]
Good job, First!

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I got bands
Broke boys comin' to me with their open hands
And I ain't trippin'
I'm just sayin' now everybody wanna be my friend
I finally fell in love
Now all these bitches wanna come and fuck up my plans
I'm just tryna be who I am
It's just somethin' they will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Same life, gettin' rich, whoa I got a fuckin' problem
Tryna flex up on young Posty, we gon' tell them what's up (we gon' tell 'em)
We gon' tour motherfucker, came up, I ain't lonely
Gotta problem Santiago, 45 by the gut
Post and 1st, we in the cut, we were smokin' on that woods
And they think it smells good and they all want a puff (they want a puff)
Said they see me at the show, they was in the front row
They wanna fuck, I told them bitches come and jump on my bus
We got molly and we got Xans
And we got drank and we got plants
And we got white and we got gas
And it's just somethin' they will never understand

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I got bands
Broke boys comin' to me with their open hands
And I ain't trippin'
I'm just sayin' now everybody wanna be my friend
I finally fell in love
Now all these bitches wanna come and fuck up my plans
I'm just tryna be who I am
It's just somethin' they will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand

[Verse 2: Larry June]
They will never understand
They used to didn't love me now they callin' me the man
Baby, where are you goin'? Love, you know I got a plan
I can elevate your life, your life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Keep them niggas far away, they prayin' on my downfall
You don't fuck with me the long way so, baby, what you here for?
It could be so simple, meet me out in Frisco
Yeah yeah, yeah-hey
Calculate your steps and keep your circle small
Understand that nothin' lasts forever
Glamorization of this lifestyle will leave you desperate
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I got bands
Broke boys comin' to me with their open hands
And I ain't trippin'
I'm just sayin' now everybody wanna be my friend
I finally fell in love
Now all these bitches wanna come and fuck up my plans
I'm just tryna be who I am
It's just somethin' they will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
They will never understand
