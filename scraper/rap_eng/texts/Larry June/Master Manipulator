[Intro]
DVME, ayy, DVME

[Hook]
Fuck the rap game, bitch I need a check
(You doin' good now, sock it to me, yeah baby, shit)
I bought a beamer coup
(Nice car Larry, sock it to me)
And bought my bitch a Vette
(You know sweetie, you look so scrumptious now, sock it to me, yeah baby, damn)

[Verse 1]
Bending corners in a scrape, gotta bust another knot
All a nigga know is mob, get it out a bitch twat
Aye my rims 3 piece and my wrist cost a lot
You ain’t never had no bitches, you the type to stalk a thot
Hit, hit, hit it with the remix, then I serve the whole block
Designer everything, I got horses on my socks
Took my new bitch to eat, crab legs on the yacht
Bitch looking like Aaliyah man, I want to fuck now
When I’m in the A-town niggas know how I get down
Diamonds dancing like a jabberwocky, I’m that nigga now
Bitch you getting on my fucking nerves, stupid ass tramp
I don’t never trust these hoes but I always keep my strap

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You know I gott keep 1 hundon
When I moved to Vegas, I bought 4 guns
Knock the bitch in Puerto Rico, she go hella dumb
Hella thick and heard on a hundred sum’n
This rap shit hella easy, I just rap my life
Got some niggas upstate doing fed time
I pray to God I don’t get that knock at my door
I got fast cars but I drive slow
I had to get it so I made it shake
Dom Pérignon in the stake
Make the money triple out of state
Money calling I ain’t never late
Two Cuba linx, gold chains, bitch rocking Cartier bracelets
I know a lot niggas shady, that’s why I copped the M80
Swear to God
