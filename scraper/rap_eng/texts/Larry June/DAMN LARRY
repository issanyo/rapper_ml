[Intro]
Uno, yeehee, damn
Sock it to me
Sweetie look at me now
Yeehee, shit, damn damn damn

[Chorus]
I got bankroll in every fuckin' pocket
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, damn damn
Fuck the rap game I'm already ballin'
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, oh my god, goddamn
I don't give a fuck about the damn rules
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, damn damn
I put my Beamer coupe on Forgi twenty-twos
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, damn damn

[Verse 1]
Today I bought my white bitch a poodle
She said she liked them Birkin bags so I bought her two (ayy)
I'm a motherfuckin' street nigga (shit, damn)
I like my bitches sexy with a little attitude
I'm looking for a gold desert eagle (pop pop pop, yeehee)
I check the punk bitch if she give me attitude (hold on sweetie)
I used to pimp a ho named Tina (good job Tina, swear to god)
She gave me half a million then the punk bitch blew

[Chorus]
I got bankroll in every fuckin' pocket
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, damn damn
Fuck the rap game I'm already ballin'
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, oh my god, goddamn
I don't give a fuck about the damn rules
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, damn damn
I put my Beamer coupe on Forgi twenty-twos
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, damn damn

[Verse 2]
I don't never do no motherfuckin' free shows
If the bitch ain't gettin' paid then she a freak ho
I don't like rapping but it bring me big dough
Yeah we know your song but we also know you broke (damn)
I'm a Lyft driver (Uno), I'm a pimp nigga (yeehee)
I'm a D-boy (damn), I'm a rich nigga (sock it to me)
Ayy drop the beat
Look at how my fuckin' ice hitting (sweetie look at me now)
I got three whips (yeehee), I got five women (shit, damn damn)

[Chorus]
I got bankroll in every fuckin' pocket
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, damn damn
Fuck the rap game I'm already ballin'
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, oh my god, goddamn
I don't give a fuck about the damn rules
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, damn damn
I put my Beamer coupe on Forgi twenty-twos
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, damn damn damn, goddamn, damn damn

[Outro]
I got bankroll in every fuckin' pocket

Fuck the rap game I'm already ballin'
