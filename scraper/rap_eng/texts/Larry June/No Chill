[Intro]
Hey, I made this beat
Gold chains swanging

[Hook: Kool John]
I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill
With that Henny in my system, I ain't got no chill
Where that lean, where that molly, I ain't got no chill
I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill
I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill
With that Henny in my system I ain't got no chill
Where that molly, where that weed I ain't got no chill
I ain't got no chill, I been poppin' pills, I'm bout dollar bills ya
Oh she twerkin' still, tryna fuck her still, I ain't got no chill

[Verse 1: Kool John]
I took ? for the racks
I hit your bitch from the back
All I do is hustle and stack
Drippin' sauces, selling swag
Everyday a nigga stay geeked up
She let me beat like a sprinkler
Fuck on her once then I keep her
A bitch is wetter than a sprinkler
Charge a grip for the verses
Talking chicken, no Churches
Then she want me like purses
I get the money no pressure
Real nigga, never change
HBK when I'm banging
Young nigga rich and I'm famous
I keep it lit like its Vegas

[Hook: Kool John]
I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill
I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill
With that Henny in my system, I ain't got no chill
Where that lean, where that molly, I ain't got no chill
I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill
I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill
With that Henny in my system, I ain't got no chill
Where that molly, where that weed, I ain't got no chill

[Verse 2: Larry June]
I don't got no chill
All I smoke is kill
Super high forreal
Ok now I'm good, backwoods, crackin' seals
Turn that back up, [?] is a hit, good job Kool John
I'm laid back, she goin' crazy, we on a Futon
Big hammers with extendos, when a nigga go slide
All my hats say Fresco, for the Bay one time (mob)
Slide to the rich, hit my nigga coop, mob to the town
Talking on the internet when I see you never make a sound
I ain't got no chill
Sipping on this Yak
Call my nigga Darryl
My nigga just took 2 to the chest, couldn't knock him down
These niggas hating on me, I just made another hundred thou'
White beamer on them 22's slidin' with the top down

[Hook: Kool John]
I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill
I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill
With that Henny in my system, I ain't got no chill
Where that lean, where that molly, I ain't got no chill
I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill
I ain't got no chill, I ain't got no chill
With that Henny in my system, I ain't got no chill
Where that molly, where that weed, I ain't got no chill
