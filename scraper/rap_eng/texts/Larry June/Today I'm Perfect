[Intro: Larry June]
Nigga I might go to L.A. tomorrow
Nah fuck that I'ma hit Seattle
Nah fuck it I'ma hit Diego
Fuck it I'ma hit the A town
Nigga get your motherfucking money up
Nigga I might hit New York in the morning nigga
Nigga have your bitch, nigga giving me sun-dried tomatoes for breakfast, nigga
Got the bitch taking walks and shit now
The bitch say she in tune with life
Told the bitch run to Whole Foods nigga
Get me some distilled water, and a protein shake
Damn, in that trap bitch

[Verse 1: Larry June]
Don't hit a nigga phone, tripping off the bitch
I'm really having money, I'm fucking hood rich
The punk bitch chose, she on a nigga line
She gave me twenty thousand and some all black nines
I'm mobbing through the point, two-tone semi
Try to rob me, I'm busting 'til this bitch empty
Both cell phones cracking, man I could have  bought a Bentley
Know some niggas in New Jersey, real project niggas
I don't do no motherfucking cocaine
I'm too busy sending hoes, gettin paid
Man my Vegas bitch, she love playing the blade
Last night she brought a nigga 6k
Hit a nigga line, prices going up, shop now, hurry up and buy
I see it in your eyes, you a fuck nigga
You ain't really 'bout it, nigga you a liar
Dropped outta high school, got the work for the low
Sold the shit for the higher
22 inch three piece, nigga 300 just for the fucking tire
God damn young nigga fucking balling
God damn

[Hook]
I'm perfect
Damn right bitch I'm Mr. Perfect
(Bitch I'm doing terrific)
Hoe,  I'm perfect
(Good Job Soldado)
Everything I do is fucking worth it (Shit!)
(Bitch) (God Damn!)
Perfect
(Ouch, damn, darn)
I'm perfect
Bitch, damn
I'm perfect
Everything I do is fucking perfect

[Verse 2: Larry June]
Drive the whip like a race car
Bend the corner knock your fucking face off
Hit my jeweler said he got the Rollie with the red face
Now I'm shitting on em
Rental car taxin', So I said fuck it
Went and took my fucking plates off
On the interstate, 5 pounds of marijuana, Even getting shake off
I'm feeling like a chemist, on your head like a dentist
We don't never leave a witness, bitch nigga
Forgiato spinning, I might fuck the bitch and take her out to dinner
Put her on the blade, now she moving fast
I done made the bitch a sprinter
Why the fuck you playing with me?
My money up, I don't be around
Put a ten on your head
Damn, you niggas getting too old
I just knocked two hoes
I just poured two fours
Now I'm feeling like Kobe
I need a Whole Foods endorsement
Eating kale with a white bitch, she was tired of the square shit
She love how a nigga ice hit
On the phone with my black bitch
My Asian bitch worth 100 bricks
I'm the father to this rap shit, my DJs rock Raf Simons
God damn
Yes Lord

[Hook]
I'm perfect
