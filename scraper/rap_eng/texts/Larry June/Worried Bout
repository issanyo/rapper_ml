[Chorus]
Don't want a bitch, that's worried bout another bitch
Let's get rich and buy a fucking hunnid whips, a real [?]
I know you probably ain't used to this
If you ain't with it, then baby you know you can dip

Don't want a bitch, that's worried bout another bitch
Let's get rich and buy a fucking hunnid whips, a real [?]
I know you probably ain't used to this
If you ain't with it, then baby you know you can dip

[Verse 1]
Made a way through the bullshit now a nigga doing good
Fuck a bitch from the back then you know I gotta roll a wood
Fuck the rap game, don't give a fuck about what other niggas doing
All I got is street money if you wanna keep it one hun'
On a hot pursuit for a prositute [?] shit
Yuh one thing a nigga won't do is give free dick
Break a bitch for the food stamps and I need the [?]
Two snow bunnies, black bitch and a mexican, god damn
Stop the whip, load the clip, drive by
Fake nigga all rap, wifi, house nigga
Seven point six two's make em milly rock
Came up, no more selling base rock god damn


[Chorus]
Don't want a bitch, that's worried bout another bitch
Let's get rich and buy a fucking hunnid whips, a real [?]
I know you probably ain't used to this
If you ain't with it, then baby you know you can dip

Don't want a bitch, that's worried bout another bitch
Let's get rich and buy a fucking hunnid whips, a real [?]
I know you probably ain't used to this
If you ain't with it, then baby you know you can dip

[Verse 2]
Bounced off, parked the whip, rolled a splif, check my iPhone, touch another six
Need another bitch, all these hoes [?] bend ya hoe backwards, hit ya hoe manners
Goyard swagging [?] new cannon, this a fn, bitch five seven
Ain't nobobdy fucking with me, niggas sleeping on me
Whipping [?] in a [?], god damn niggas still [?]
Bounced out and they still worried
I'm not inlove I don't feel nothing
Fresh off the lot, wheels on it
Give a punk bitch a demonstration
Roll a quarter up on my registration
Hit my nigga juice for the mix [?]
Wrist colder than a ice tray
Man trap shit is all a nigga know
Break a brick down [?]
Rap game nigga fuck a show
Bitch hit six times in a row
God damn bitch you doing hella good, might have to buy the bitch a range rolls
Pockets all great four leaf clover put the good [?] in the baking soda

[Chorus]
Don't want a bitch, that's worried bout another bitch
Let's get rich and buy a fucking hunnid whips, a real [?]
I know you probably ain't used to this
If you ain't with it, then baby you know you can dip

Don't want a bitch, that's worried bout another bitch
Let's get rich and buy a fucking hunnid whips, a real [?]
I know you probably ain't used to this
If you ain't with it, then baby you know you can dip
