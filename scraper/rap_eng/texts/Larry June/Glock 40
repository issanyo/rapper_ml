[Verse 1: Larry June]
Handguns choppers, grass like a farmer
Tuck like Osama, Smoking on Obama
Juggin' in the winter, juggin' in the summer
Never graduated, but i'm riding foreign
I'm walking in the sand, condo in Hawaii
I'm living what i'm saying, you niggas steady lyin'
Fuck the radio, I can do without it
I'm riding with the whammy, I don't trust nobody
I'm the Pusherman
I can get it to you
Get out the pussy
Chopper in the bushes
Slide through the blade
2's on the six
To these rap niggas I'm a father figure
Riding by myself I don't need a nigga
Put the heat to em like a TV dinner
I'm a real nigga I can get it off
Tell me what you need I can get it to you
I ain't in to all that fake shit
Why the fuck you speakin' on my name?
Hit my phone on some groupie shit
But pillow talk to yo main thing
Okay I see that you a fuck nigga
On my momma man these niggas bitch made
Hit a pussy nigga with a switchblade
Ho i'm getting money bitch 3 ways
Nigga YeeHee!

[Verse 2: Larry June]
They say a nigga changed, dammit I got aim (good job Larry)
8 thousand for the paint, dammit I am paid
Smoking on the finest, birkin for my bottom
I like stripper bitches, I like hoes in college
I'm standing on the couches, I'm drinking out the bottle (fuck!)
Don't fuck with broke niggas, they schemin' and they plottin'
I'm not a fuckin' rapper, I'm chillin' on a island
I shop at whole foods, I'm really havin' guala
You say you want beef but I bet you won't run up
One hitter quitter I bet you get done up
We all about money so this is a come-up
Grind in the winter and shine in the summer
Hop out the Benz and I jump in the hummer
(Phew! Phew! YEEEEHEEE!)
I made it safe that's a touchdown, smoke a nigga like a hookah lounge
You don't wanna hear that ruger sound (goddamn)
I got bitches that'll get it now
I ain't lookin' for a friend bitch
Ho I need another hundred thou', I wake up early then I run a mile
Hit the blunt then I'm to the trap, I turn off then I take a nap
Wake up with another 50 racks! (aye, damn)

[Hook]
Goddamn (aye!), Ohhwee (yeeeheee!)
