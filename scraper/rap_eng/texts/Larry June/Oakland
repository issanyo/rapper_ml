[Verse 1]
Woke up in a mansion with a kilo in the kitchen
Thirty six o's of that a one whitney
Networth 420 bout to touch a millie
Came from project living but that added to my vision
Text my ex bitch at night then I realise I was tripping
Man I need to smoke a wood hit my nigga for the killer
I ain't got too many friends I be chilling with my jeweler
Took my hoe to play some tennis set up shop around two
Man I gotta stay true so I still slide through
Check the trap before I dip take the bitch to get a juice
Feeling groovy drop the roof man these hoes know how I do
At my honey comb hide out with a bitch that's full peru

[Chorus]
Yeah riding to my old shit on my way to kick it with some hoes
Pop some more with em
But I'm still focused
House by the ocean
[?] spot in Oakland
House by the ocean
[?] spot in Oakland
Riding to my old shit on my way to kick it with some hoes
Pop some more with em
But I'm still focused
House by the ocean
[?] spot in Oakland
House by the ocean
[?] spot in Oakland

[Verse 2]
My wip white like Ronald Reagan
Left wrist on roc nation
Twin turbo took the bitch racing
I'm taking model hoes on vacation
Specialized [?] had to grab that
Cute lil bitch leggings on [?]
She cook and she clean and her pussy game fantastic
Love is not a dream yeah you fucking with the real Larry
Four in the morning grab the Uber you can link with me
Roll another a you can hit the beach with me
We can touch at least fifty just come spend a week with me
I know the reason why you hit baby keep it g with me
[?] bought a [?], [?] gold digger
Fuck a hoe that  don't listen baby make the right decision
Twenty thousand off the dribble first time hitting [?]
[?] spot by the ocean just to keep my racks up

[Chorus]
Yeah riding to my old shit on my way to kick it with some hoes
Pop some more with em
But I'm still focused
House by the ocean
[?] spot in Oakland
House by the ocean

Riding to my old shit on my way to kick it with some hoes
Pop some more with em
But I'm still focused
