[Verse 1:]
Slow feet don't eat
Two bands, two nights, I'm a real P
Who gives a fuck about the rap game
When you can make 20k in two weeks
I pray I never catch a case
Chopper with the laser, broke niggas player hating
Now bitch, please hand me that extended clip, bitch
Thank you so much now
Aye, master manipulator
Water whipping 'til I buy a Bentley and a house in Asia
St. Laurent, Goyard, God Damn, playing soccer in my new Maisons
I'm not a house nigga, I be really trapping
Got it on my own, now I'm living lavish
I'm a 90's baby, but I keep the 30 on me
Case these niggas really want the action
I'm the realest nigga in the rap game
You the brokest nigga on the internet
Wrapped 17, jumped in the Cadi
I'm in Arizona playing with the packs
Now I got that just in case money
Just in case the trap stop jumpin'
Went to jail, beat the case on me
My OGs call me big homie
If you need it I'm the postman
Shoot me half of it, here's the tracking number
Bullshitting with my money
Cut the nigga finger off and send it to his uncle
20 piece, I hid it in the oven
Gangbang, nigga choppa bustin'
I think the police on to somethin'
The bitch snitched, now I'm on the run

[Hook:]
What's hannin?
What's the number?
Joog a nigga one time
Cookie Pack
OG
Joog a nigga one time
I'm coming back
Every time
Joog a nigga one time
(Shit, good job Sledgren)
Joog a nigga one time
(YeeHee, Sock it to Me!
Yeah baby, Gawd)
Joog a nigga one time
(Ay Ay Ay, Damn
Shit, Aye, God)
Joog a nigga one time

Aye, look, check it out though
I heard you niggas got a issue
Holla at me, nigga, I ain't hard to find
(God)
Nigga tomorrow nigga I got a commercial
With Colt 45
Get your muhfuckin' money up
(Joog a nigga one time)

[Verse 2:]
Fuck what niggas talkin' 'bout
40 in the couch
Fuck a drought
Send the pack down South
Get my money up and buy another house
Aye, I pick my nigga up
He fresh out
Then put him on, with the ooh-wops
All he know is that trap shit
So I bought nigga two Glocks
I bounced out with a Mac on me
20 piece and the pack on me
Bitch, hand me that Smart Water please, thank you
I might change my name to Pack Homie
Got a problem, I'll smash on it
Real nigga fuck a rap homie
If he telling on the low
I pray he never put the tasks on me
Gotta get it, now or later
Super clever how I put these words together
Thirty six Os, whiter than a dove
Had to let it fly together
I pimp hoes, rock shows
I don't really give a fuck about a label
Me and Sledgren going super crazy
Blowing loud pack by the acre
Treat the foreign like a bucket
I don't give a fuck, gone like the blunt
Fuck the rap game, made it happen
Mean in trap going up
Louie duffel in the trunk
Bad bitches gone fuck
Bought the other bitch a truck
My Beamer coupe, got it tucked
Push a button, Glock 40, hit him in the stomach
(God damn)
Gawd
