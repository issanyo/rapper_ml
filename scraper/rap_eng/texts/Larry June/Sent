Young nigga, 20 on my wrist

Word around, June hella rich
Damn right it's all off a bitch I don't give a fuck
On the low these rap niggas on my dick
And I'm riding round with a mac nigga I am not a lick nigga
When I sold dope it was never zips nigga
I'm the realest nigga in the trap bitch fuck with me
Talking shit to the ho you a nerd
I done broke the nigga heart when he got them papers served (aye)
We on the (?) me and Rico tryna knock something
Elevate the ho, let the bitch go and cop something
Givenchy for my snow she a goon
Every night she bringing two G's home
In the trap blowing dro laying low
Tryna dodge the motherfuckin 5-0

[Hook]
Drip drop, flip flop, wet paint, 22's
30 dick on the hammer swear to God never snooze
Now a nigga doing good crab legs for the food
Break the bitch for everything yeah I'm playing by the rules
Drop top [?] coupe coulda got the hard roof
Speaking on my name bitch and I don't even know you
Bitch hit me back ho when I'm in a better mood
Tryna get rich ho I ain't tryna marry you
Slide through the muhfucking block on some mob shit
Can't even lie bitch I'm higher than the cockpit
30 on the hammer make the block have a mosh pit
Pull up on a nigga make him strip like my old bitch
Bitch hit my phone say she hit for a whole brick
I told her good job I'll be there in bout 2 minutes
He asked me how I do it I just told him nigga keep it pimping
Ask about me in the hood they'll tell you that I really did it

[Hook]
