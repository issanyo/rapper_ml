[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Ain't no way around it man
It's a one way street

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Ain't no way around it, we just tryna connect the dots
Giving up these stripper ho's that's tryna take what we got
Here for the inspiration, we just tryna connect the dots
Tryna connect the dots, puttin' in that work everyday (okay, okay)
Ain't no way around it, we just tryna connect the dots
Giving up these stripper ho's that's tryna take what we got
Here for the inspiration, we just tryna connect the dots (yeah)
Tryna connect the dots, puttin' in that work everyday

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Good morning, I'm waking up to some tunes I like (I like this one)
Smooth transitions happening in my life (you're a smart man)
Check my phone, always gotta secure the bag (well done)
Business man, they see me get in my [?] her balls hangin'
I let the laws attract, I let the laws attract (don't leave me hangin')
She got a deep throat, I'm making her jaws collapse
Okay I'm all for that nasty nigga I'm out here still movin'
She can be my Mary Jane or she can play Gabrielle Union
Anyways, power up my melons, now I feel connected
Scraping up this resin, taking dabs like it's imbedded
Negative energy gets shredded, yeah, I'm about my peso's
Eating vegan tacos that's Pancho's or [?]
Man there

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Ain't no way around it, we just tryna connect the dots
Giving up these stripper ho's that's tryna take what we got
Here for the inspiration, we just tryna connect the dots
Tryna connect the dots, puttin' in that work everyday (okay, okay)
Ain't no way around it, we just tryna connect the dots
Giving up these stripper ho's that's tryna take what we got
Here for the inspiration, we just tryna connect the dots (yeah)
Tryna connect the dots, puttin' in that work everyday

[Verse 2: Larry June]
I'm on my way to Philly, hit my bitch and told her meet me
Louis Vuitton everything, my jewels fresh squeezed
Look at this view, goddamn, yeee
I hit my nigga Dizzy, it was too many for me
It was Keisha, Maria, Melissa, Sabrina
It's a black girl, a Mexican, a Asian, a vegan
She at Whole Foods, no makeup on [?]
I might take the ho to dinner but I can't the ho a dream
'Cause my life so real, fresh Coronas on chill
Tryna make it out this condo and buy a mansion in the hills
It's crazy how your life can change from the decisions that you make
We just puttin' it all together and tryna make some'in' shake, for real

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Ain't no way around it, we just tryna connect the dots
Giving up these stripper ho's that's tryna take what we got
Here for the inspiration, we just tryna connect the dots
Tryna connect the dots, puttin' in that work everyday (okay, okay)
Ain't no way around it, we just tryna connect the dots
Giving up these stripper ho's that's tryna take what we got
Here for the inspiration, we just tryna connect the dots (yeah)
Tryna connect the dots, puttin' in that work everyday
