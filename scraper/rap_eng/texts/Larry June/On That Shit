[Intro: OG Maco & Larry June]
Help!
On that shit, on that shit
On that shit, on that shit
Help!
On that shit, uh, uh
On that shit
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
Smoking butane in the Yucatan
In the SUV, not a minivan
In your bitch chest like a mammogram
Got two shooters with me like the son of Sam
T.I.P straps, kneecap
Fish hit 'em, we ain't good
Goods coming, we in that
I play with pussy, never played that
New chains like the slaves back
Fuck the records, want the J's back
Want a Maybach just to crash that
Dreamt of money in my last nap
Checked my pockets, really had that
I'm talking numbers like the NASDAQ
Met a German, got my swag mapped
I'm smoking gas out of swag packs
Fuck a tag, I gotta have that

[Hook: OG Maco]
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit

[Verse 2: Larry June]
On that road, look like a rollercoaster
Chopper blowing like it got a runny nose
I never let a bitch talk back to a pimp
Bitch what you smoking on?
I never fuck with industry hoes
I did it once but fuck it, ayy ayy ayy
Ride around with the K, K, K
Coupe white like a KKK
Two cellphones like Gates
That's my nigga, free my nigga man
In Puerto Rico it was me and Wayne
I'm tryna put a bitch on a plane
Low pros when a nigga swang
Five point oh, highway
Bounce out, valet
Crab legs, chow mein
Faggot ass bitch, gotta pay the price
Got so much ice, shit ain't right
Creep through the night, in the undo
Roll the windows down, drrrrrr
Hittin' bitches with the lingo
Yeah the conversation worth a hundred racks
Ayy bitch, hand me that motherfuckin' scale ho
Ayy ayy

[Hook: OG Maco]
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
I'm on that shit
