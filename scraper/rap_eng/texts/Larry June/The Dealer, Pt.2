[Verse 1]
Damnit I done raised my fucking prices, I need like 50
When I'm not rappin', bitch, I'm four deep pimpin'
Black M80, nigga, this is not a semi
Aw sweetheart you doing so good now
Ho, let a nigga hit it, ay
Big four four, I just got it for protection
I'm somewhere on the island with my bitch gettin' becky
Bust down roley, only wear it when I'm blazin'
Fresh squeezed orange juice's what a nigga sippin', damn
Back to the trap, no nigga got these prices
Still got the jugg for my motherfucking pisces, hold on
This is for my trap niggas mobbin' with no license
If you got a problem, bitch nigga I'm slidin'

[Hook]
Drug dealer, drug dealer, healthy nigga, healthy nigga
Drug dealer, drug dealer, healthy nigga, healthy nigga
Pimp nigga, pimp nigga, pimp nigga, pimp nigga

[Verse 2]
Oh no no no, no he didn't
Tryna jack my swag but yo' ass was bullshittin'
M16 with the night vision
My chain do the moonwalk, when lights hit it
I got three cellphones for no reason
I still think I'm in the trap
(Ay bitch, hand me that salt and pepper, please, thank you)
Nightmares, cold sweats, paranoid, loaded TEC's
Demolition, on the mission, weigh it up, send it out, postman
White teeth, gold teeth, fitted cap, dopeman, oh man
Thought I lost it but I didn't
Realest nigga in it, fuck the rapgame
If this don't work then I'm sellin' cane
To electric ales in my fishtank
Still got a square bitch in Brisbane

[Hook]
Drug dealer, drug dealer, healthy nigga, healthy nigga
Drug dealer, drug dealer, healthy nigga, healthy nigga
Pimp nigga, pimp nigga, pimp nigga, pimp nigga
