[Verse 1:]
Trying to leave the trap game, but the money call a nigga back
They giving niggas football numbers, but I gotta pay the rent
Latex gloves, wrapping up a brick
Wear a bigger shoe when I hit a lick, case they try get the footprint
Hide in plain sight, went and got a front business
Heard them niggas on to me
Shhh, Aye, shut up
I think my other phone ringing
What's a pimp without a vision?
Came from nothing, had to get it
Therapeutic when I spit a 16
Make a broke nigga get his issue
Cat nigga, wack nigga, walking 'round sipping fake Act' nigga
Relax nigga, keep this chop on me like an axe nigga
Quit playing with me
Nonchalant, I don't talk about it
I just do it like a Nike sneaker
Build my credit, buy a black Bentley
Pull up on a nigga like a night creeper
God damn, Aye

[Chorus: Larry June] (2x)
Hit my line, I got everything you want
Big guns, case you niggas want the funk
But No You Don't
No You Don't

[Verse 2:]
I been doing this for a minute
Put a couple bricks in the fender, hit the road
Homemade guacamole with the lemon juice
Can't forget cilantro!
Banana clip on a M80
Knock a nigga off with my rollie on
Then I meet my bitch at the Whole Foods
Get a few groceries then I head home
30 in the Mac, 30 in the Glock
My HK in my bitch name, your Rolex got the tick-tock
Tell a punk bitch kick rocks, you wastin' all a nigga time, hoe
Super high, nigga mind gone
Blowin' all this fucking hydro
Looking at the bigger picture, gotta have my own shit
I'm a grown man
Start young, get it young
If you ballin', then invest
They don't wanna see us winnin'
They just wanna see us stressed
Made a million off of nothing
Sipping Henny on a jet
Gawd

[Chorus: Larry June] (2x)
Hit my line, I got everything you want
Big guns, case you niggas want the funk
But No You Don't
No You Don't
