[Intro]
Alright, let's put these motherfuckin' headphones on
Yeah, I'ma just go off the head
Just record me right here, yeah

[Verse]
I'm hoping I can touch a hundred bands by tonight
I'm lowkey stressing but I still bought the ice
Bust another knot then I bought my son a bike
Bust another knot then I bought my son a bike
I'm always by myself 'cause I don't trust a lot of niggas
Lowkey XD, forty in the kitchen
I fuck with square niggas, I fuck with street niggas
TM on the beat so you know this bitch a hitter
I still gotta jugg for my motherfucking pints
You thinking I'm your boyfriend, you must be sniffing nitrous
Tools on the Beamer, got that bitch looking righteous
Tools on the Beamer, got that bitch looking righteous
Switch it up, off the beat, one time
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn
Run up on a nigga with the four five
Keep going Larry, sock it to me
Came up, noww they say a nigga changed
I remember cold nights on the blade
(fuck, keep it rolling, keep it rolling
I'ma just switch it all the way up)
I don't know owe a nigga shit, I been working like a bitch
I don't do it like to brag, but this shit here feel like ten
I don't do no fucking xans, I like Beamers, I like Benz
Twenty-five for the bag, one for me, on for the bitch
Off the dribble, 'nother six
Ho I need a money counter
Call me Uncle Larry, leave her drippin' like a water fountain
When I'm in Atlanta, pull up on my brother Sean Kelly
I got plenty bitches, every time I ask her she gon' let me
Hit it from the back, then she make me grab her some spaghetti
Man the head so good I dropped my iPhone 7, uh
Everything a nigga do you know it's fucking A-1
Had a whole lot of bitches but I never paid one
Took the bitch to Napa Valley, told her pinkies off the cup
Plain hoody, Saint Laurent, eight-fifty off the jump, yeah, uh

[Outro]
Merry Christmas bitch ass nigga
You know what I'm sayin', TFM
Off the dribble
Keep the change, ya filthy animal
