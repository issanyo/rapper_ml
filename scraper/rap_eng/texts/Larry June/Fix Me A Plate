[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
None of these, can’t touch you
None of these, can’t touch you
None of these

[Verse: Dom Kennedy]
I ain’t ate all day
I told her fix me a plate
I got police on my bumper
Baby momma issues and the streets trying to kill you
But I was born in LA
And it ain’t no escape
If you see Superman he gone look like me
You haven’t had this feeling since Nate Dogg at least
None of these, can’t touch you
You really thought you gone see us lose
Look at the wood Cartier frames
Aye, but I ain’t ate all day

[Verse: Larry June]
I had to make me a plate
Smoke a wood in a shade
Drop her off on the blade
My orange juice cost 8
My Js from 88
You ain’t had this feeling since Short 97’
One button on the coupe roof flying away
I ain’t ate all day

[Verse: Hit Boy]
I had her make me a plate
Never take her serious if she got instafame
Hit Boy go against the grain
Vicious Gang
If just more appealing when I’m on beat
You ain’t had this feeling since Doughboy at least
Swinging all through the lot
All gold on the creek
I’m bringing surf club back when Chilly Chill is free
And that’s on me
Making plays in the huddle
Break on 3
I’m on a peso spree like the cartel
Telly bound sipping Martell
Hotboxing with a thang slapping R.Kells
I tell them play this in the Jeep
You listen to my life when you listen to me
Hustling all day had to dip in the streets
Tell her baby heat up the stove 350 degrees
Cause I ain’t ate all day

[Outro: Dom Kennedy]
I told her fix me a plate
I got police on my bumper
Baby momma issues and the streets trying to kill you
But I was born in LA
And it ain’t no escape

None of these can’t touch you
You really thought you gone see us lose
