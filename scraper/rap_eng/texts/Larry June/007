[Intro]
How you doing sweetie?
Names Larry. Larry June now
Sweetheart can you please go to Whole Foods and get me 3 farm raised chickens sweetheart? I swear to God, sock it to me

[Hook: Larry June]
I got bad hoes like double oh seven
Tuck spot in a foreign like double oh seven
Big choppa on my arm like double oh seven
I got a hundred thousand dollars and a plug named Kevin
Like double oh seven
Like double oh seven

[Verse 1: Larry June]
The bitch said it's slow but I think she's catting off
Made one phone call, hundred pounds to the south (shit!)
Number one rule never keep it in the house (good job Larry!)
Real street nigga you can hear it when I talk
They gave my nigga ten but we mobbin' 'til he out
Sit a bitch down like a motherfucking couch
You a house nigga with some internet clout
The bitch got knock now your feelings coming out
It's six in the morning and a nigga still trapping
I don't even want it if that bitch ain't got navi
Mob to the V I'm in the crest with a ratchet
Hit my nigga Shaq for the pack like "What's happening?"
Backwoods only when I'm in a smoke session
The bitch doing good so I bought the ho a necklace
Cashed out for a bitch I'm balling like a pastor
The first car I had was an E-class Lexus
Then I bought the Benz off the lot straight trap shit
Funny ass nigga choppa made him do a backflip
With my black bitch in the hood eating catfish
(Hey bitch gimme that motherfucking hot sauce ho?
Thank you sweetheart)

[Hook: Larry June]
I got bad hoes like double oh seven

Like double oh seven
Like double oh seven

[Verse 2: Larry June]
I'm chilling on the beach and I'm trying to catch a tan
If the bitch get a car then I'm hoping it's a band
They not fitting in my Prius so I gotta rent a van
That's a hundred fuckin' bales from that Arizona land
Remember in the 90's, thirty six was for the ten
That's that A1 Becky if you dig what I'm saying
Rest in peace Mac Dre, rest in peace T Woods
Rest in peace Lil Corky, they my niggas from the hood
When you really having money nigga you never show it
All the sudden niggas callin', everybody want something
I could fall off today, still be the same nigga
I swear to God I never change, my bank just got bigger
When I slide to the point I keep MAC-10 with me
I don't owe you niggas nothing I don't fuck with new niggas
I'm from the motherfuckin' Bay, where Jack Boy will get you
Sipping Fiji on the beach with a bitch from Costa Rica

[Hook: Larry June]
I got bad hoes like double oh seven
Tuck spot in a foreign like double oh seven
Big choppa on my arm like double oh seven
I got a hundred thousand dollars and a plug named Kevin
Like double oh seven
