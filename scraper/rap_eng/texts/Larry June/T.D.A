Woah
My phone was off
I ain't see your call
I ain't just tryin' to smash
I'm trying to do some yoga with you
I'm trying to watch insecure
Nah baby I don't know that girl
I think she go with Kodak Black
Fuck that girl, I just wanna vibe with you
Think of things you and I could do
[?]
[?] how she kicking your bitch out of the party whenever she see me
One and a two and a three and a four
Counting my scratch like I'm keying a car
What's the occasion, why you at the bar with your friends
You wanna tell me again?

You know that it's my birthday
My friends bought a table and a bottle of spades
Dress fitting right so I can show off my shape
I'm a couple glasses in, shaking ass on the table

Talking about it's your birthday
(It's my birthday)
You ain't gotta pay
(I ain't gotta pay)
Oh you got a man?
(Yeah I got a man)
Where he at then?
(I dunno, I dunno)
It's your birthday
(It's my birthday)
You got a new thang
(I got a new thang)
Bought a few friends
(Bought a few friends)
You want a new Benz?
(I want a new Benz)

Well work x32
