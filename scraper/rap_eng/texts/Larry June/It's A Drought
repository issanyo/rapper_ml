[Verse 1]
I play the game by the rules, baby
You know I need it all
I met the bitch on Tuesday
On Monday I called
Don't give a fuck 'bout the rap game
Or these rap niggas, at all
Keep fucking around with them fuck arounds
I'ma fuck around and get off
I like bad bitches, good weed, marble floors in my loft
.308s, .223s, can't shit pop off
It's a drought nigga, it's a drought
I need every fucking ounce
I need every fucking gram
Everything fucking count

[Hook]
It's a drought, my nigga
It's a drought
It's a drought, my nigga
It's a drought
What a young nigga gone do now?
What a young nigga gone do now?
Two eleven, in and out
In and out
In and out
In and out
Two eleven, in and out
In and out
In and out
In and out
Two eleven

[Verse 2]
Niggas telling so the block hot
So I moved my game outta town
1200 for a zip of soft
What the fuck I'ma do now
And they just killed my nigga D, that was my jugg on them pounds
R.I.P. my nigga T. Woods, I'ma roll one for you now
Just hit a lick, brick of Actavis
Let it go for six, fuck it
She just wanna fuck, she don't wanna pay
Left the hoe out in public
I put the hoe in a Hummer
You the type of nigga to just hump her
I wear Y3s in the summer
Your heart broke, you loved her

[Hook]
It's a drought, my nigga
It's a drought
It's a drought, my nigga
It's a drought
What a young nigga gone do now?
What a young nigga gone do now?
Two eleven, in and out
In and out
In and out
In and out
Two eleven, in and out
In and out
In and out
In and out
Two eleven

[Verse 3]
Weed smoke in my condo
Don't give a fuck, it's nothing
Bounced out on a pussy nigga
It was sounding like I was drumming
Trap house in the A-town
Got a AK in the oven
I don't wear no True Religion, I Japanese my denim
Rolex on Saturday, on Sunday came different
Car towed on Monday, on Tuesday I was dipping
Did a play at Popeyes, made five bands and ate chicken
I would sell this shit for the jugg, but nigga
My nigga

[Hook]
It's a drought, my nigga
It's a drought
It's a drought, my nigga
It's a drought
What a young nigga gone do now?
What a young nigga gone do now?
Two eleven, in and out
In and out
In and out
In and out
Two eleven, in and out
In and out
In and out
In and out
Two eleven
