[Intro: Nef The Pharaoh]
I-I-I tried to tell you about that bitch break
She's outta pocket, she be doing all types of shit behind your back
And you still give her unconditional love, you just don't see it
I don't know why

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
Hey Mr. Captain Save a Hoe, is you gone save that bitch?
You think she in it for the love, to her you just a trick
I told you times and time again, stop fuckin' hot thotties
She a walkin' coffin boy that pussy got bodies

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
He rescued the bitch from the pound
Dog hoe, she wasn't potty trained, she actin' out
Charity case, her ex nigga beat her up
She gave you the run around, and now you wanna pick her up?
Typical simp nigga, all for the bitch lip
She make your baby sit, and that ain't even your kid
Convertible top man, you don't be using your lid
Playing daddy at the past, she gave that ass to a trick
Now you heart broken, suicide on your mind
Wide open, Mac Mall '99
Hate to repeat myself, I told your ass a thousand times
That's what you get for tryna save that bitch, I let her drown

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
Hey Mr. Captain Save a Hoe, is you gone save that bitch?
You think she in it for the love, to her you just a trick
I told you times and time again stop fuckin' hot thotties
She a walkin' coffin boy that pussy got bodies
Hey Mr. Captain Save a Hoe, is you gone save that bitch?
You think she in it for the love, to her you just a trick
I told you times and time again stop fuckin' hot thotties
She a walkin' coffin boy that pussy got bodies

[Verse 2: Larry June]
Knock the bitch in the mornin', had her trappin' by the night
Yeah, the bay been slow, so I put her on a flight
Yeah, it's three in the mornin', and I'm still on the blade
I ain't stressed, not once when I heard about backpage
On my way to L.A. I mean [?] For the peace
On my mama, nigga, I can touch twenty in a week
Hit my nigga Nef line, and I slide to the V
I spend time in the V, I got love in the V
Lil' maggot ass bitch, don't be playn' with a P
Slide in the underdo with a mag in the C
Hit a lick than then I went and put my wrist on D
Ol' square ass nigga went and saved that bitch

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
Hey Mr. Captain Save a Hoe, is you gone save that bitch?
You think she in it for the love, to her you just a trick
I told you times and time again stop fuckin' hot thotties
She a walkin' coffin boy that pussy got bodies
Hey Mr. Captain Save a Hoe, is you gone save that bitch?
You think she in it for the love, to her you just a trick
I told you times and time again stop fuckin' hot thotties
She a walkin' coffin boy that pussy got bodies

[Outro]
