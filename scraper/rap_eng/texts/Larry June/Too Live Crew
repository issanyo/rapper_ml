[Verse 1]
Bitch why you got so much ass
Bend it over then you shake it fast
Why you stressing off who she fucking
I just broke up over a couple bands
Bust it open bitch no hands
Go ahead and do it like the tip drill
You've been shaking ass all night
Baby show me how them lips feel
Small waist but her ass fat, and she walking with that little gap
Baby how you fit that dress on ooh wee bitch god damn

[Chorus]
I like [?]
I love [?]
God damn she
Ooh wee she
God damn

[Verse 2]
Chill girl I'll break your heart
Watch your tongue she'll beat your ass
My girl really don't play that shit
You better get up on there and shake it fast
Mixalot put it on the glass
Lil flash I ain't even ask
This the one for; you to twerk it to
Me and June the new too live crew
I'm just trynna bring the dope back
Miami hurricane throwback
[?] for the shirt collar got the wool and pot where the stove at
Get it girl you've been hitting squats
You've been doing good now it's living up
You don't wanna get them ass shots
You don't really wanna give those dimples up

[Chorus]
I like [?]
I love [?]
God damn she
Ooh wee she
God damn

That knock in that truck got you hanging out the roof
See that thang in the front
Damn girl let it loose, drop it down on the floor
Hands knees dip it low, like
Look what she can do, is that your friend bring her too

[Verse 3]
Bitch looking like [?] caramel skin and them thick thighs
Good job nigga this not
Left the strip club with six bottles
[?] mob
She boost clothes and a nigga rob
Fried chicken corn on the cob
She bend it over then she make it drop
Summertime me and chuck got it
Slim thick and her back [?]
God damn she got a nose on her
That's miley cyrus
Ladidadi she just wanna party
Workaholic she just want the money
[?] bitch
I was doing bad she let me hold something
[?]
How you doing baby what's your phone number
[?] summertime had you riding for him

[Chorus]
I like [?]
I love [?]
God damn she ooh wee she
God damn

That knock in that truck got you hanging out the roof
See that thang in the front
Damn girl let it loose, drop it down on the floor
Hands knees dip it low, like
Look what she can do, is that your friend bring her too
