[Intro: Nas]
Squeeze!
Squeezin' on ya; real niggas creepin' on ya

[Verse 1: Nas]
I got cream, some ganja trees, and fronto leaves
Honda bikes, diamond dykes, rubbin' me, lovin' me
Don't let my seed hear this, cover her ears
Real shit; no surrender, no fear, we pioneers
Of all this ice shit, biscuits, and tight whips, rims
Bangin' blends in the S-Class, half a thousand
Slap pounds with cats who shot down shit
Real niggas who stay around chips, and down Cris
Sips of Henny; chicks who bless you, finessin' it, professional
Slob with ice cubes, just like Vanessa do
Reppin Q, smoke amazing Thai
Shit that givin' you triple Asian eye
Yeah, bitch, a nigga stayin' fly
From tube socks and Timbs, to blue rocks, a Benz
Who got the ends?
The type'll make 2Pac [?]
To all niggas who shine; yes, who got revenge
I won't showboat, my flow choke you
And if it don't, the fo' fo'll smoke you
Left your seed reminiscin' on ya
MC's I'm pissin' on ya
Shine cause my chips are longer
It's gremlins I'm sic'n on ya
Shots your dodgin'
While Esco could rock the whole fuckin' Garden
Real niggas always gon' play this shit..
