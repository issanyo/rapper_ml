[Verse 1]

Heard ya got your masters
Did college up
Never look back
Now that's what's happenin'
And it's good to see you made it out the hood with a degree a true man with passion
Now you can enter the so called white man's society and go right past them
Lookin' in the wall street journal for your face but it's always absent
Everyday that's him eatin' flan and ambrosia his watch on his arm golden, Latin
Try to get his attention but he's flinching very close(unknown) so I mention
We was neighbors some time ago
He was kinda cold
In this restaurant full of his kind and mold
He sighed and tried to look surprised I know
This side of the city where he resides so
I had to go
I heard him laugh hard at some sad black jokes
Hate so called intellectuals no balls and suggest we vote
He stand all proud speakin' to correct his folks
Suggest that we don't sell dope but I guess it's true but who the fuck are you

[Hook]
Who are you trying to tell me who I am
Trying to tell me who I am
Who are you trying to tell me what I'm not
Tryin' to tell me what I'm not
Who are you trying to tell me who I am
Tryin' to box me in tryin' to find who I am


[Verse 2]

I'm Idi Amin
I'm Marcus Garvey
8 Track Brown
I'm Muhammad Ali
I'm Reginald Lewis
George Washington Carver
I'm Nas with incredible music
Let's do this
Thinkin' of a Master Plan
Sippin' on Disasters
Smokin' on Gangsta
Watchin' niggas argue chillin' on my bar stool
With my hell up in Harlem, hat in hand, with a girl named Pat
She more than the waitress you order your drink with
She's divorced the banker and bought the bar
She got an automobile
She give her order to kill
You get caught and robbed
You can see your walk is off you can lose your rhythm when your out in the gutter for awhile
You easily go from soft to hard
Now it's all about hustlers, number runners, ho's, and sharks
And we all know the code of the block
And you're talkin' some gibberish, some anti nigga shit cause you marched back with Rosa Parks
Brother don't start
Go build your Noah's Ark
You can float to the end of the world then pretend what you're not
But I know what you are
While I roll in my car
While I'm spinnin' my knot
While our enemies plot you ain't outta the shot
Matter of fact you are an easier target
And I respect everything you accomplished, but hope that I never get old and talk that nonsense
So who the fuck are you

[Hook]

[Outro]

Why can't you tell
Why can't you tell
