[Hook: All]
Back to the grill again, the grill again
(Repeat x6)

[Verse 1: MC Serch]
You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this
And you're more optimistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip rhymes that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep going and going just like an Energizer battery
Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere
And then it gets you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in the car, parked it
Beef like blunts, if you got it then spark it
And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hitlist
Went back to the '70s and brothers got on grins
'Cause they can step to some sisters and say "Slap me some skins
"Honeydip," and take the squad to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick 'em in the grill

[Hook]

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Word up MC Serch, that was fly. We gonna try like this, though, um...

[Verse 2: Red Hot Lover Tone]
Bust a style while I do it, if you know it, oh you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewing
I'mma drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumping to it
So, so, so, where did you go, what do you know
So many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh lots and lots
And any rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)
R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)
All my hoes look like Sasquatch (Not!)
And uh, George Bush gets enough props
Well, anyway, I'mma slay slay lay
Pull a ho around my way and make hooker souffle
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for making me part of history
Kicking 'em in the grill

[Verse 3: Nas]
Finesser, keep a Tec-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep you under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, the nightclub flirter
This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm waving automatic guns at nuns
Sticking up the preachers in the church, I'm a stone crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book
For you I got a lot to shoot my songs in here
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with gonorrhea
On the mic I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that y'all) That y'all, kick 'em in the grill

[Hook]

[Sample]
"Chubb Rock, with the man, with the plan, Chubb Rock"
"Chubb Rock, with the man, with the plan, Chubb Rock"

[Verse 4: Chubb Rock]
The Chubbsta breaks, head nods, he fakes, steady rate H
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of "The Dialect, The Derelict"
The murder list, Vanilla kicks it to climb on the crucifix
Coming around the mountain, when he comes to sell the record bumps
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're humming
The door rings, yo I'm coming
To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guinness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
'Cause YOU are a BLABBERMOUTH
A blabber, it gets no badder
Lyrics on a diet 'cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gwen to the Guthrien, jumping up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses
Word up, the illustrious
Rapper dapper snapper fish, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo kick me in the grill grill

[Hook]

[Sample]
"So get up and get down, Serch'll never stand still"

[Verse 5: MC Serch]
So here's a true or false, tell me if it's factable
You wanna kill the Klan, shoot the fans that a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ayo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey
Or basketball, football, taking papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill chill, can't swing
'Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring
Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
Try the G I'll put you in a tree just like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the ho
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio
'Cause I saw you eating pig knuckles, with Frankie Knuckles
In a club called Chuckles wearing name plate belt buckles
Goddamn your life is flimsy
Gave you enough respect, but took it back 'cause I was stingy
So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker I'll say, "Yeah I fucked your moms"
Until she calls back I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick 'em in the grill
