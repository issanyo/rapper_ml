Ayo I hit the Earth like a comet, Invasion
Nas is like the afrocentric asian
Right here with the amazing Green Lantern
Serious radio, y’all know what it is

NaS too real, NaS true king
You know the king

Cars with police radars on highways boppin
Bullpin therapy cell block dodging
Pissy stairways missed them days not when
They shut down the stores when I’m shopping
Used to be pop locking, train hopping
Face covered in stocking
Six pack Bud drinking gambler
Fuck them cameras in front of the man
Sing the hustlers mantra, hands of luck
More hits than gambling huff
I hollered Indosia, 40 belows covered the toes
I was a soldier with the Popeyes sippin Amota
Nigga honestly I call this a culture
My sister’s a snake, my brother’s a vulture
My mother’s the block, my father’s a ghetto piranha
Swimming with sharks my tones false settle drama
Obama, if the kids mirror you
We’ll all push Masaratis with the silver hue
They fear that connection
I rather die in a box than live safe in witness protection
Gotti was a racist but he still get praises
We don’t give a fuck, nigga gangsta is gangsta
Bricks come with Bill Clinton’s name on it taped up
Hollywood Lohan parties people they facing them
Kim Kardashian, body with the waist slim
Know some hood girls who did time that could take them
Rappers changing families, fags are all lost
I’m at the Waldorf, Vancleave under the sleeve
Save the small talk, I feel alive
New Porches Jordan number fives
Already said I’m the last real nigga alive

Nas, let my words guide you
From crips to piru this is survival
Turn my voice up
Let my words guide you
From crips to piru this is survival
Invasion!
