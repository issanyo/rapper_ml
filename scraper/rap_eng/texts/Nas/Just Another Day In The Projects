[Verse 1: Nas]
I had a dream, I was a gangster drinking Moets, holding Tecs
Making sure the cash is correct, then I stepped
Investments in stock, sewing up the blocks
To sell rocks, winning gun fights with the cops
Custom-made suits, hands full of ice and gold
Making thousand dollar bets on the dice I rolled
Girls working night patrol, the whore market
When I walk, niggas is rolling out the red carpet
Now how good could a black man have it?
Living like a king, is a habit I keep an automatic
The whole crew life is love above word
Rumors about the way we make niggas well heard
Nicknamed the "Killa Clan"
Soon to kill a man
If there is still a gram
I shake my left hand
And not do a minute on the rock
Cause if I do a minute on the rock
The juries getting knocked
I'm 'bout girls, that kept braggin'
Cause I own all the runner-ups in every state's beauty pagent
Inside a lamborgini, called the Martini
Little kids in the streets, they wanna be me
I'm living in a mansion, hold a niggas wife for ransom
I'm like a rich Charles Manson
A view, backyard, about 40 acres
You read about me in the papers
I hit the jackpot
Every night from all my crack spots
We attack cops for props
I got sons with guns, they all done crimes
They so wild, they even scare my ass sometimes
Other niggas on the blocks is so corny
I got my dime, I'm lookin like someone smoke for me
Bad bitches kissing my ass
I got a few mill. in the stash
With beds made of cash
But on my head was a price
I made the bad-guys in Miami-Vice, look nice
All of a sudden, I got raided
My crib was invaded
But, the Nas still made it...
To the getaway car
And now my driving skills got to be up to par
The cops parked the car
And sprayed till it was smoked up
That's when I woke up

Yea Nas, nigga
Word Life Kid

[Verse 2: Nas]
The whole thing was a nightmare
I fell asleep watching Scarface
Laying in the chair
Standing on the block
It was flooded with cops
Through the parks... Was the D's and the Narcs
Watching me walking out my building
Staring and hawkin shit
But I as fortunate
I usually be going out with the 9
Instead, I had 10 bucks to buy a dime...
Bag of weed
Never cracks I ain't with that
I bought buddha, some phillies, and a Kit-Kat
Now I'm walking back, through the drug infested area
Which is filled with hysteria
When a cop yelled, "Come here black."
I thought to myself, "what part of the game is that? "
I didn't do no crime, for you to be wasting your time
With your antagonistic mind
He said that I was being smart and I better run
He looked like a Klans-man with a gun
So I started floating
Police in Queensbridge, they don't be joking
I ran up my crib, in the nick of time
Rolled up a philly and stashed the 9
Police later left, I was outta breath
And what not
Somebody got shot, that why it's hot
I called my man and told him the adventure
And later, I meet him at the community center
I need a six pack of Beck's
It's Just Another Day in the Projects!
