[Nas]
Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr. Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was 12, I went to…

[Hector]
And you're sitting at home doing this shit
I should be earning a medal for this
Stop fuckin' around and be a man
There ain't nothin' out here for you

[Zoro]
Oh yes, there is… This

[Jungle]
Yo, Nas, yo, what the fuck is this bullshit on the radio, son?

[Nas]
Chill, chill! That's the shit, God, chill

[AZ]
Ayo, yo, pull down the shade, man
Let's count this money, nigga
Ayo, Nas, put the Jacksons and the Grants over there!
You know what I'm sayin'?
‘Cause we spendin' the Jacksons
You know how we get down, baby

[Nas]
True, true

[Jungle]
Nas, yo, Nas, man
Shit is mad real right now in the projects
For a nigga, yo, word to mother
All them crab-ass rappers be comin' up to me
Man, word to mother, man
I think we need to let them niggas know it's real, man

[Nas]
True indeed, knamsayin'?
But when it's real you doin' this
Even without a record contract, knamsayin'?

[AZ]

[Nas]
Been doing this since back then

We tryin' to see many mansions and Coupes, kid

[Nas]
No doubt, we gon' keep it real, true, true

[Jungle]

Stop pointin' that at me, dunn, take the clip out!

[Nas]

[Nas]

[Jungle]
Pass that henrock, pass that henrock!

[AZ]
Yo, we drinkin' this straight up with no chaser

[Nas]

[AZ]
What is it, what is it, baby?

[Jungle]
