[Intro: Nas]
Regeneration
Composer; DJ Premier
Maestro; Sir Nas
Yeah
Nas in the building
Premier's in the building
Yeah
This is how we redefine, the music
Let's go

[Verse: Nas]
Yeah, ya'll know I gets it on, sip on Dom
Clear the throat, wet the palate
Compose a ballet, then expose a rare talent
The kick drum will have you numb, the snare's valid
That's how Premier styles it
Yeah ya'll know he gets it on, that's a given
Every song I've written, make the sky clear blue
Like the beginning scenes of The Simpsons
Dominions of the British Empire
We'll listen to Bach, with tea and biscuits
Preem revisits, songs centuries old
Hip-Hop; symphony's orchestras out cold with it
You know the flow's administered
By the deputy, rhyme prime-minister
Sir Nas, I'm certified
Please be seated and your shirt and tie, dresses on
Arrive early, when the curtains rise, bet it's on
A certain etiquette involved with this
Unlike any other music genre is, bring the drama in
