[Intro]
The scientist is a man who was learned how to think
At least about scientific matters
That's why he can do so many amazing things
But a scientist isn't supposed to believe anything much
Unless its supported by evidence...

[Verse]
Lame foot soldiers get croaked in my vicinity
The ode for old murder, criminal activity
Diamond encrusted bracelets, escape death
Cars and yachts, I flaunt things that say success
Flow to the water turns my electric chair on
Inside the LeBaron trunk, got Pakistan her-on
Nasir Jones, not a Capo, the Picasso, word painter
Black Sinatra, rap King Cole, gangsta
Point blank body armor
I'm violence, you're the Dalai Lama
You just holla drama
