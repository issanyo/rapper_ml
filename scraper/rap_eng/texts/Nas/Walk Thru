'Bout to walk through

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I was standin' in the field, had to get it how I live
Used to post up on the hill, this before I made a mil'
I got 5 for 30, come and shop with me, what it is?
Came from standin' in the field, I'ma walk you through a deal

[Chorus: Future & Nas]
Call shots, 'bout to walk you through a drug deal (here we go)
Call shots, 'bout to walk you through a drug deal (here we go)
Yeah, I got a mil', gotta walk you through a deal (uhh)
This the way I got a mil', gotta walk you through a deal
'Bout to walk you through a drug deal (here we go)
Call shots, 'bout to walk you through a drug deal
This the way I got a mil', gotta walk you through a deal (ESCO, walk with me)
This the way I got a mil', gotta walk you through a deal

[Verse 1: Nas]
I called my man, I know he had it, told him, "Make somethin' happen"
Re-up, I got visions of stackin'
Everybody's for self now, nobody helps out
Intimidated by what I might accomplish, they jeal' now
They keep they connect to theyself or they might tell me a number
Like they givin' me a deal, like they lookin' out for real
He won't give me the plug math so I can talk to his man
That's how I knew somethin' was up, he was puttin' his grand
On top of mine, that's fine, he can do what he want
Took me to meet him, the plug chose the restaurant
The plug trusts me, he comfortable, he invites me to his house tomorrow
I'm in a Dodge, pull up to his garage, pull out some dollars
Give him some bread from a bank envelope
He gives me a laundry bag full of dope, that's all she wrote
Now it's my empty kitchen, a pot and pan
The product, supply and demand, know who I am? Escobar

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Nas]
I was standin' in the field, had to get it how I live (in the field)
Used to post up on the hill, this was before I made a mil' (post up on the hill)
I got 5 for 30, come and shop with me, what it is?
Came from standin' in the field, I'ma walk you through a deal

[Chorus: Future & Nas]
Call shots, 'bout to walk you through a drug deal
Call shots, 'bout to walk you through a drug deal
This the way I got a mil', gotta walk you through a deal (yeah)
This the way I got a mil', gotta walk you through a deal

[Verse 2: Nas]
Can't even trust niggas that say they love you
Niggas put more trust in women when it comes to this hustle
Cause everybody thought my mind and muscle was enough
Nobody ever knew my shorty was who found the plug
Maybe cause she cute they think she will not set them up
She used to take a separate car from us to go pick up
33 for a brick, I only make three G's
Gotta save money, all I buy is Jordans and weed
Summer time, S560 all I need
Twin turbo charged Benz, don't pull me over when I speed
With my hood Miss America
Other pretty women on her body in the area, everybody be sweatin' her
A bartender lookin' better than a pole stripper
My ex said, "How this bitch take my whole nigga?"
I kept her in Louis tight jeans with gold zippers
Ain't seen her in 25 years, she stole from niggas, uhh

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Nas]
I was standin' in the field, had to get it how I live (yeah)
Used to post up on the hill, this was before I made a mil'
She had to get it how she feel
I got 5 for 30, come and shop with me, what it is?
I used to post up on the hill
Came from standin' in the field, I'ma walk you through a deal
Shout out to the hill

[Chorus: Future & Nas]
Call shots, 'bout to walk you through a drug deal (shout out to the hill)
Call shots, 'bout to walk you through a drug deal (shout out to the hill)
This the way I got a mil', gotta walk you through a deal (ahh)
This the way I got a mil', gotta walk you through a deal

[Verse 3: Nas]
Got that, sturdy 30 clip, murder Queens rap
Picture in the precinct on the wall where the D's at
It's bigger than us all, please believe that
OG Esco, DJ ESCO bumpin' out your speaker, yeah you need that
Fuck sufferin', from pompous Republicans on puppet strings
Breakfast at Tiffany's, watches, rings, a couple chains
Never talk on the phone or text, a hustler's thing
Before I would become a king, I was a 40th Ave-r
Timberland, corduroy hat turned backwards
Sagged down denim, women off of moistness at him
Think the voice had 'em, extravagant, low hat matchin' the 'Lo jacket
No Saks Fifth Ave yet, my dough was slackin'
I figured I'd stick with my best guys, less guys know me
Then I could live my best life low-key
So I creep like TLC, Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, yes Nascobar
Got big, got bread, got far

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I was standin' in the field, had to get it how I live
Used to post up on the hill, this was before I made a mil'
I got 5 for 30, come and shop with me, what it is?
Came from standin' in the field, I'ma walk you through a deal

[Chorus: Future & Nas]
Call shots, 'bout to walk you through a drug deal (way I got a mil')
Call shots, 'bout to walk you through a drug deal (way I got a mil')
Call shots, 'bout to walk you through a drug deal (now I'm countin' mils)
Pot working, yeah, 'bout to walk you through a drug deal

[Outro: Nas & Future]
