[Intro: Damian Marley]
Now greetings to the world
The accumulative intelligence of Mankind is what makes us special amongst all other species
Everything is built upon the foundation before it
Huh
Boom

[Hook: Damian Marley]
These ancient thoughts
This ancient look
These ancient hearts
This ancient soul
These ancient songs
These ancient people

[Junior Reid]
Like the Earth, and the sky
And the sea, and the birds
And the trees, and the songs
With melody

Like a mountain, like a valley
Like the river, like the lake
Like the earth, when it quake
It's anciency

[Verse 1: Nas]
This is rock and roll meets Aristotle
I fly those G5's through the skies to Cabo
Martial arts more ancient than Tae Bo
Swordsman, more ancient than Zorro
Ancient like the pharaohs or priests of Yoruba
Or Obeah, your phobia, you paro
Your path narrow like climbing Mountain Kilimanjaro
Ancient men traded cattle
Before Columbus was lost in travel, ancient canoes got paddled
Before the horse saddle there was camel
Spears before arrow, arrow before ammo
Tribal paint before camo-
Flage, chief before sarge, or lieutenant
Village elders before the Senate
Used to sail the seas before the compass was invented
Ancient people spoke free, they didn't need a 1st Amendment
In the beginning, the drum was the text sendin
There was moons before months, and time before minutes

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
From love, on to language, on to hieroglyphics
Di invention of the wheel, on to mathematics
Di almanac, di calendar, on to geographics
Herbal medicine, to antibiotics
Ginseng to horse tonic
Water pump, water pumpee on to hydraulics
Moonlight, candle light, on to electronics
Instinct to knowledge, classroom to college
Ayyy
All of these ancient thoughts

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Junior Reid]
Man ah buss di earth, man ah buss di sky
Junior Gong and Junior Reid we meditation it so high
Man ah trod de gravel, it dutty and it dry
Oh oi, dem nuh see nuh wings, but man ah fly
Babylon fi splurt, dem nuh know what life is worth
Oh Oi, tell dem stop polluting Mother Earth
Man ah mek ah trod, mi robe, mi sandals and mi rod
Dem shoulda know, ancient man, yes man ah God

[Outro: Damian Marley]
Ancient thoughts
Ancient look
Ancient hearts
Ancient soul
Ancient songs
Ancient people
