This is what it sounds like
When a thugs dies (pow, pow ,pow) (we won’t cry)
This is what it sounds like
When a thug dies (pow ,pow, pow ) (tears from your mama's eyes)

When I’m with my niggas this is how it sounds
It ain't nothin nigga give my niggas pounds
This is what it sounds like when I’m with my hoes
Hard dicks bitch you fuckin with a pro
This is what I’m thinkin when u bitch niggas plott'en
I’m gonna kill this nigga right now I got him
This is what he say right before the lead hit him (yo please don’t shoot)
Man fuck'em, did him
When the cops come this is what a rat say
He shot em 4 times and he ran that way
Now a nigga on the run, this what real nigga do
You can stay at my crib I heard what happened, come thru
A bitch or a nigga can help a nigga hide
Open up the front door and welcome u inside
Coward nigga want war, well then we gonna ride
Wit the pump and the 44 and catch a homicide

This is what it sounds like when a thugs die (pow pow pow) (your moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when a thug die (pow pow pow ) (mamas cry)
This is what it sounds like when a thugs die (pow pow pow) (tears from your mama's eyes)

At his funeral this is what u heard (oh my god oh my god)
Ya that was that nigga's bird
And that ***** is foul
Do u know that ho's style
When u was locked up she had another *****s child
The other *****s me, I knew that was his wife
What the fuck am I gonna do, bitch is begging for the pipe
And I was coming through on the reggy every night
But then this nigga came home I said it wasn't right
9 months later shit got crazy
***** flipped out when she said it ain't his baby
Slapped her up, gun butt her with the nine
Put it to her head til she told him it was mine
(you fucking bastard I'm gonna bury em 6 feet deep)
Heard he looking for me daily, carrying his heat
Now he’s under the ground may he rest in peace
Cuz he was married to a ho and I was married to the street

This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (tears from youe eye)

Its been 2 years ain’t nobody catched me
Hennesy and pepsi, my Tech will protect me
Out of state made alot of cake, they respect me
Got a new identity, hoes want to sex me
Havin memories of my seed kind of stress me
Cuz my son is 2 and his appearance reflects me
Gotta new Lex GS chrome wheels nigga
Drove all the way home, man shit is real nigga
Got back to the hood it was raining and pouring
Knocking on this bitche's door like 3 in the morning
She knew I was comin, I saw a cop 2 of em running
Let off 4 shots then I caught 2 in the stomach
She set me up, the rain and the led wet me up
(pow pow pow) that’s the sound of a thug dead cuz

This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (tears from your moms eyes)
