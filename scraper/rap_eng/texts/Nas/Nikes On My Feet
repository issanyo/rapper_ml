And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

[Verse 1: Rowlan]
Yeah
I said lace em up, lace em up, lace em up, lace em
I turn Nikes on my feet into Freddy versus Jason
A murdering on cinema displays, fazed by days
That someone saved and engraved in they brain
And partly trained to rave
Then mentally drain when it came
To writing these movies and releasing all of they pain
Call it movies in my head
And you should be glad that I do it too
Cause most story tellers are dead
So I'mma prove it if I gotta spar with Rocky
But the last guy I sparred with had me screaming who can stop me
And honestly, it's not cocky it's honesty
Mixed with property, I've acquired through killing modesty
A modest man usually get it first, and I'm quick to burst
And serve a bitch who's full of thirst
They tell me bitch and faggit shouldn't be said
But I'mma scream every word I want until they announce me dead
I see a twisted cop, and ask him how he figga'
He can stop how I talk even if I'm yelling huh huh
I could say some words and leave you mad
But another Eminem man, y'all could never deal with that

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

Yeah
See I'm the type of dude with issues to pretend your shitzu knows jujitsu
Call it a fair fight then hand you the tissues
Damn I wish you, would say something smart
So I could kill you with some knowledge
Hang you up and play some darts
With Homer, Maggie, and Bart, and maybe Lisa
Pick pocket your ass then head to Moe's with your Visa
Get some pizza, maybe a few brews then
Search for your girl with the dude from Blue's Clue's
Enough with the bullshit get off the cartoons
Man I hate fake shit, that's why I never liked your crew
Man this word play is much too easy
You may call that chick wifey, but we call that hoe sleezy
Get Terio, let em' know that I killed em'
They used to call me Twinkie cause them bitches man I filled them
Give me words and a world
And my dick and some girls
And some sights just to see
And a life I can be all I wanna be in
Maybe maybe maybe see all I wanna see in
Maybe maybe set of 20's and a fucking Beamer
Then maybe just a hook from a Justin Bieber, Justin Bieber
