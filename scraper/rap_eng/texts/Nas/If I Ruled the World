Martin Luther King: "I am happy to join with you today, in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation."

Let's get back to where we used to be/ DC's here so get used to me/ if I'mma do it, I'mma do it unusually/ all I need is good vibe and cue up the beat/ if I was the king I'd reign for a golden generation/ and race wouldn't matter, neither would ya station/ the only thing that would count is never get complacent/ and everybody needs get met that are basic/ life's wasted if you don't get up off your ass/that's Y my mission's to shatter this ceiling of glass/ they call my culture bad say most of us crass/ well look at me boy I'm the symbol for class/ flow like a whip on the freeway, cruise control on/ top down sunlight giving a bath/ all I want if I ruled is to plant some seeds/ to see the scene Martin King saw in his dreams

Chorus: If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (Mind, body, and soul free to travel the globe lets go)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be if the world could be mine we'd all shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still living for today in these last days of time)

Social issues eradicated/ we all work in harmony problems never aggrevated/ we find a way to honor the/ hard working folks that help keep up this nation/ the teachers, the firemen, and kids that they raising/ its time to raise our minds to the constellations/ and out of the basement/ that's Y I spit it stellar for the lives that are wasting/ in hopes that they hear it and feel compelled/ to blaze the trail, succeed and live to tell the tale/ hard to fail if you understand the code/ everything that's shining ain't diamonds and gold/ the wealth that you mining better be for your soul/ we write the chapters in our own history/ so live the legacy that you want to be told over centuries/ compete against ya self no more having enemies/ keep ya circle close get rid of negative energy/ remember all good things come in trinities/ we all one entity, and if I ruled the world when I left they'd B missing me

Marin Luther King: "And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, "Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"
