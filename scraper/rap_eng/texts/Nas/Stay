Look at the pain in his eyes
You realize that real eyes can realize real lies
That quote was always weird to me for some reason
Maybe it was the fear that those I hold dear will be in some treason
I'm paranoid as hella somebody help me
Doctors diagnose that maybe my brain isn't healthy
That's redundant though cuz we all a little off
Hypochondriac think ill die if I have a little cough
That's an overstatement give me credit though I'm patient
I place my faith in something I can't see but feel
He's my doctor too so I remain patient
When things get rough go to my room and start praying for real
What can I do Lord to make them see?
That I'm weak and a rapper but human as can be
No room for me in fake societies
Abolished from parties cuz I'd rather hold on to sobriety
Thanks for trying me but sayin no is too easy
Can't believe y'all fill the void with parties and think its pleasing
Oh well power to you if you can avoid
Attention seeking and making ruckus and noise
Go about life in the same exact manner
And I promise you'll be blessed with your own manor
Maybe not with serfs but you reap what you sow
To show your kids hard work pays off when you grow
Up, if you ever mature
You'll see reading is knowledge and there's knowledge galore
The capacity of the mind is unlimited
That's like ordering some food just to not finish it
What a waste there's ppl that'll kill to be in your place
There's ppl In the grave that would want to have your face
Another chance at life
To be a perfectionist strive
For all the goals and achievements
That only you would like
So stay
A little closer to my heart
We could stitch it back if we've grown apart
Fusho you're in another realm that I can't see
I believe you're in heaven cause of Christianity!
So why shed tears over your own eternal goals?
Cause you left a burn mark on all our souls
You left us without warning nothing can you say
If you were still here this is what I'd play!
Driving to school the day of your death
Thugs mansion on, and I'm taking deep breaths
Letting out my tears for some strange reason
Later found out that you had stopped breathin
That you had stopped breathin





I guess you couldn't Stay
