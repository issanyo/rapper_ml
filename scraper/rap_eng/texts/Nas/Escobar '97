[Hook]
Honies, cash, weed, cars
Ghetto celebrities and hood movie stars
Gat slingers, now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas to Nas to Escobar

[Verse 1]
The path we all walk starts out long, it's like a boardwalk
Monopoly, some make it around, some go down, it's prophecy
Happy days balancin' with life's atrocities
Hoppin' in V's, knowin' some day I got to lead properly
High up in a five, realizin' the price paid
For this life laid in the light shade
One might say, top of the world's two whips, a crib and a girl
Quick to celebrate it, poppin' corks like they made it
Pretentious, arrogant niggas is senseless
Pro ball players with white wives, peep they night lives
While you could catch me in a crisp white five
Dark tinted, Dijon-scented with Al Green on
My theme song, Love and Happiness, how can it seem wrong?
I mean, before this, I used to rock a Taurus with the donuts
Now, I grown up, got it chromed up
Got the rap game sewn up, sho 'nuff
Niggas actin' cool but it's really no love
I feel a slow buzz off the dutch
This is everyday, every second, got to make it pay
Every lesson I learnt got me open
While most of these rappers'll stay burnt

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
With so much drama in QBC, it's kinda hard bein' Escobarro
El Derado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle
My life is like a Donald Goines novel, we wave glasses like bravo
Drunk niggas with mad problems and shot pockets
My niggas on the block rock this, box cocaine, cook it and chop it
Lookin' to profit in different ways, goin' through this difficult stage
Called life, but each year my physical's praised
Some fell beyond the reach of help
Cut in the street, thinkin' they could teach theyself
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly, feed our family, the streets are insanity
Amply, livin' in this thug's fantasy
Richest nigga in show biz is what I plan to be
Heavy chain and my QB sway, livin' this king's life
Magazines write about me in this dream, it's all tight

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now, the main thing that boggle my brain be all the bottles of pain
Ice, the chain and all the followers came
They tried to throw me off track but I caught that
They thought I lost that but I'm continuin' to make more stacks
Halftime, New York State of Mind, It Was Written was hittin'
Trips overseas, southeast, diamond and riches
Sleepin' on the plane, wake up when we land, feelin' real scared
On the ground, Rollie flush, princess cuts and large rounds
The crews up, findin' time to shine rocks
It's real, you violate, be in a pine box
If it go there, I lay you before you lay me, it's crazy
I didn't make the game, the game made me
Records for the babies so they raised up in mansions
Haters keep hatin' and ladies'll keep glancin'

Y'all know the routine out this muthafucka, word up
