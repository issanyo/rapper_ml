[Refrain]

[Verse 1:Nas]
Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas
Family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone
Kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse
She fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first
Can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona
I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one
That's how my game was won
White 740 Beamer
Licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son
She got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex
So I guess I'mma just stay

[Refrain]

[Verse 2:Nas]
Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you
Don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you
I might kill you but do I got love for you
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time
Want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love
What a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me
I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer
Pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to stay


[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You can drop a “Wet Floor” sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
I’m tryna figure if I should even appear
Or should I escape town? Catch a Greyhound
Change my name, right – catch a plane flight
Out the country, let them ma’fuckas hunt me
Come and catch me if you want me
Know they’ll lock me if I stay
But where I’mma run to?
I got a good girl, we got a son too
And all we went through, we ain’t see eye-to-eye
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die
So if they give me one, or if they give me two
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?
Would you find someone new or would you stay?
Like the hoes when they lay with me?
Puppy eyes when I go, sayin’ “stay with me”
Aw, girl, you bad as hell and yet I’d love to
But see I got a girl I’m really makin’ love to
Therefore I’m feelin’ a lot more guilty when I rub you
That’s why I skip all of that kissin’ when I fuck you
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate
I had you, but you can’t have me, I never stay

[Hook]
Stay

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Ha! Life in a hometown, ‘fore I could take a step
I’m gettin’ grown now
And startin’ to notice that I see the same hoes around
Guess they had to go ‘round, my raps is profound
I got the flows, but yet a nigga ain’t got no sound
Copped a beat machine, I’m cookin’ up my own now
Got my mind on the city where it goes down
See, if I’mma get to where I’m goin’ then I can’t stay
Although I love it here
I’ll be damned if I sit around another year
Dreamin’ dreams, hopin’ somehow that they just appear
The hardest part of leavin’ is to know my mother here
Oh, but I’m comin’ back – oh boy, believe that
Let’s show the little niggas, boy, you can achieve that
Got the city on my shoulders, piggy back
Hello, my name is Cole and I’m here to stay
