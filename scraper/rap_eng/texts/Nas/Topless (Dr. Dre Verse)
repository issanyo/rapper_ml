[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
1996, I left it all behind
Cause I ain't got no roof on mine
I had to jump ship, I double back for my
My accountant handle my shit
I never been the losing kind
Grind
I'm feeling like it's year one
I'm a fool anywhere, near square one
But ain't no glass ceilings, I crash through 'em
Ain't no cold spells, I light a match to 'em
Ain't no haters, right, just say congrats to 'em
This is Detox, this rehab to 'em
I bring it back years later, let it flow through 'em
Putting that chronic in their system like I used to do 'em
Respected, so it's proven that's what I been doing
Moving the game like weight and everybody been using
Bitch, it ain't really nothing left to say
You're tuned in to Detox, I'm Dr. Dre

[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
(Pow) Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
(Pow) Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 2: Nas]
Your skin's your travelling bag of your existence
Yours is shabby and scab, while mine's glistenin'
Vivid on my skin, how many continents I visit then
You can journey with me to different places by listenin'
Shitting on them, your brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it, however you want it, I love it
A hustler's wit, the grit, the grind
My genetic code make up, murderer by design
On Mayan calendar time, when night meets day
I'm in the light grey Bugatti like a high speed chase
Adrenaline like jogger, the jumping rope in place
Muhammed Ali hobbies, no Pilates, tryna keep the ocean by me
Hit a rich man's wife, see what these hoes can buy me
Looking forward, but it's nice to see the road behind me
Hotel's a seven star, Baguette's glowing
Keep your lid, yet dawg, the private jet Boeing, topless

[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
(Pow) Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
(Pow) Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now
