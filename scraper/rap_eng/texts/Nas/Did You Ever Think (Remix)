[Intro: R. Kelly]
No matter what ya'll say or do
We gotta get this money
Watch out playa, we come for you
Take all of your honies
First of the month and rent is due
We gotta get this paper
Come for us, we'll wait for you
A million men can't take us

[Chorus: Tone]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
I used to think about how I was gonna make it
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say

[Chorus: Tone]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

[Verse 2: Nas]
Hey yo
Now who knows poverty like Robert and me
Did you ever think you'd be dancin' and vibin' with me
Did you ever think you'd push a Ferrari, blast a Nas CD
With 5 TV's and DVD's, come on ride with me
Ain't naan nigga fly like me
Honey you heard about the style I got
We from the wildest blocks, where police
Make arrests, carry heat wear vests, we ghetto
Never thought we'd ever reach this level
My people behind metal
The streets coulda had us, but now we live lavish
Our freaks be the baddest
Bus 'em out while maids change the sheets on the mattress
It's deep cuz I never thought I'd reach this status
Walk around and grown women stop and look
They recognize me, no longer hide they pocketbooks
Hate me now cuz I ain't gonna stop, you're stuck
The remix is R. Kelly, please drop the hook
Come on

[Chorus: Tone]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

[Bridge: Tone]
America
Did you ever think
Ya ever know
Did ya ever think
Ya ever know
(Come on)
Did ya ever think
Ya ever know
Did ya ever think
Ya ever know
(Trackmasters)

[Chorus: Tone]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
No matter what ya'll say or do
We gotta get this money
Watch out playa, we come for you
Take all of your honies
First of the month and rent is due
We gotta get this paper
Come for us, we'll wait for you
A million men can't take us

[Chorus: Tone]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

[Outro: Nas]
I just wanna thank God
For making Nas the don
And R. Kelly, the don
Yeah, sittin' pretty
