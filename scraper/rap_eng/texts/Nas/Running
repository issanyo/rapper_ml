[Verse 1]
Shouldn't Have To Cry For You To Make Me Smile
Hey, Talking Down To Me, Like I'm your Child, Oh
Shouldn't Have To Beg You, To Hear Me Out, Oh
Shouldn't Need Another Reason, For Me To Shut You Out
But My Heart and My Mind Are In Battle

Chorus:
Loving You Is Like Running
Running On The Line
Is Like I'm Chasing Down The Love
And There's No Finish Line Inside
I Just Keep On Running
Running On The Line
Then You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time!
I Keep On Running
Feels Like I'm Running, Running On The Line
I Keep On Running, Yeah
And You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time

[Verse 2]
What's A Little Laughter, Oh
When It Comes With So Much Pain?
Oh, I'll Be Here Forever
If I Wait For You To Change
Oh, Oh, I Don't Know If I Can Do It
Cause I'm Running Low On Fluid
Can't Believe You Brought Me To This
Open My Heart, You Straight use It
What's It Gonna Take For Me To Break Away?
I Really Don' Know, Hey!
Cause My Heart and My Mind are in Battle

Chorus:
Loving You Is Like Running
Running On The Line
Is Like I'm Chasing Down The Love
And There's No Finish Line Inside
I Just Keep On Running
Running On The Line
And You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time!
I Keep On Running
Feels Like I'm Running, Running On The Line
I Keep On Running, Yeah
And You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time

[Verse 3:Nas]
Yeah, yeah
You got the color purple on, Running and waving
Saying nothing can keep us from it
Thats my woman, but you might fall in love with the youngster
Hipster, someone taller, bolder, richer, and locked down
Maybe someone of a different ethnic background, terrific
I wish you the white gown
The garter, white veil, rings and roses
Tiara in your hair like a queen
I toast ya, told you
Lately I’m binging on Mercedes Benzes
Lot of my lady friends is getting older
Looking for somebody to cuff them
Rush into a husband
Don’t even truly love them
At they best friends bridal ceremony
Jealous and they lonely
Cryin', but they’re phony
Yo, Fiona, you know me
We still got time to find real L-O-V-E
Like the lyrics in the real love songs, the oldies
So keep running for me
If you’re out there listening
Sir Nas don’t need a trophy I need a Mrs
Trying to give it that wife and kids business
Not just arm candy
My dream is to have a family

[Fiona] Bridge:
All I ever wanted was a love on top
All I ever needed was a love that's mine
Did you ever really love me or is love so blind
Uh, here I go I'm 'bout to cross the line

Chorus:
Loving You Is Like Running
Running On The Line
Is Like I'm Chasing Down The Love
And There's No Finish Line Inside
I Just Keep On Running
Running On The Line
Then You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time!
I Keep On Running
Feels Like I'm Running, Running On The Line
I Keep On Running, Yeah
And You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time
