(3LW intro)
I'm getting little tired of your broken promises promises
Lookin at your pager seeing different numbers(fade out)
(Nas rap 1)
For all my underground dj's make 'em, make 'em clap to this
Thank you for your support:
Everyday she walk by see me on the same block
Same crew like she never seen rocks, chain, watch blue
Different color boots on park your car
Few predicates ex con, rip arms
Betting chips, puff medicine
Play my gangster beats
Tunnel bangers Flex and Clue tapes bang in the streets
I'm just a fly thuggish baller
Shortie anxious to meet
Til I die keep wanting the head, mink to the feet
But shortie jail beat might get me five to life
Maybe in time you could be Nas's wife
Play school study law
I'ma pay your tuition
Come on campus, buy your books
Do your baby'sitting
My unusual style may confuse you a while
When you get older i'ma bless you with a child
See now you was unaware that this thug had affection
Let me be your angel
And i'll be your protection

[Chorus:]
You say that you will and then you won't
Sometimes you do sometimes you don't
Sometimes it's yes other times it's no
But I can't take it no more
Take the wrong and make it right
Don't say you can't make up your mind
Is we is or is we ain't
Cuz I can't take it no more

[Verse:]
Baby baby you keep putting things before me
But I wuz there for you when you had nothing
So baby baby basically
Examine you examine me
Now or never give me all or nothing

(chorus repeat)

[Verse 2:]
Baby baby you keep
Tellin me your changing
You promised you will be a better man
But no soon as you see your peeps
There
