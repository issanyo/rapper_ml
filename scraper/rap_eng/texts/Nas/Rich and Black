[Intro: Louis Farrakhan]
And regardless to how much power you have
When God sends prophets and messengers
They don't care nothing about your power
Because they come from the power

[Verse 1: Nas]
Rare nigga, I'm a wonder
Your best success is my worst blunder
Feds tap the number
Jewelry Jacqueline Onassis could appreciate
Weed to alleviate the pain
Eddie King, Richard Pryor pinky ring
Watch your conduct nigga
Throw parties for my niggas that’s living, you guessed it
Models y'all keep them if they anorexic
Love em but can’t trust them
Hate em but won’t bust them
Caking in savings, spending, wasting
It's like a custom
Tats are hieroglyphics
Lipstick on the collar
I got more to lose than you do but I’m a rider
When did the rules change
Y’all living trendy on pennies
Meeting deadlines with ease, no game
You fire, I'm butane
Gator Timbs, ostrich belts
These be the times that I surprise myself
My niggas looking like black crows and packed shows
The Don voice stay pristine like I'm still seventeen

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I'm rich, Black, African
Rocking the golden Mack
Shearling leather, Gucci leg it's on my back
Willie Bosket hoodlum in the trench
Rinse these niggas
'86 Cazals dicing near the fence
Mike Tyson disciple
Trifle with my pen, it's a rifle
Sixteen ways to shoot you through your Chrysler duke
Exhaling with niggas, the jails argue
Bring the best niggas to the table
I'll sic all my whales on you
Custom wooden speakers, rock Elysses, rump on polices
Dump on creatures, holidays and preachers
Stainless steel watches, ostrich turtlenecks
Here's the deal
If we can't come in, they can't have the field
Bones in Cisco', murder instrumentals
Cayenne Porsche rap, how many horses live official
I run with generals who flash Uzis in interviews
My shit is deep, we fly, swiming, dude

[Verse 3: Nas]
Verse two gotta be all murder just like the first verse
Timbs yellow like the hair on a Malibu surfer
Yellow like my Harry Winston glistening arm B
Yellow like New York City piss-stained concrete

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
That’s right, yo, who voted toasting in the wind
Las Vegas Otis
What you know
Leave it right here we ghost in the Lotus
Put a package on your head, be promoted, keys in effect
Paying these dumb fucking D’s off with donuts

[Sample: Louis Farrakhan]
I hate, to see you, acting like a slave
To get an advance here, an advance there
Because somebody else controls your destiny

[Verse 4 continued: Raekwon]
Aiyo, I’m rich, Black, umbrella calico captain
Wes Craven with a blade and a black
I’m hood ornaments
Junkies win awards in my tournaments
My shit is listed like informants pics
You know we order hits
Planes flying, niggas is sure to get you
Whether in Costa Rica, Lisa, she sure to twist ya
Eating Chow Lo Mein with chopsticks
Glocks with aim
Watermelon chips, pop some ‘pagne
For all the riches
Niggas forcing out they feelings, kid
Whether in hallways or the boats, now feel us, kid
Out in Alaska, in the Astons, remember my passion
Hungry wolf who never eat in his castle
Bolivian connects restless, yeah
Chef ambidextrous
Quick to back you in like the Lexus shit
Hunted by the FBI
We gracious, more demonstrations
Shit is tough, milk the Carnation
