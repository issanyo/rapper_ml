Hook

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that (X2)



Verse One

Wanted to be a latin king/ but had roman features/
Forgotten by social workers/ who failed to reach us/
Little animals/ who wanted to fuck ours teachers  /
Uncles in the kitchen/ they was Cheffin up ether

I am new York built/I am south Bronx strong /
Talent drove me crazy bitch/ I am the black swan/
Shaking up the game like/  Tokyo/  Hong Kong /
Any place put upon  is gonna  be  gone/

This is Micheal Cera Rap/it seems to be my  fault
Valentime verse the world/it seems to be my  fault
Am Taking they attacks /;with a grain of salt
Am Killing shit/Get my yellow tape and the chalk

The media scape goat/feeling the ropes tension
My alter ego/in all black like a French men
Hip-hop Junkie /in  need of an intervention
Best from new york and they always fail to mention

Hook

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that (X4)

Verse  Two


Raised to  rob and  steal/ never to  beg and barrow
So I Prayed every night/ for better luck tomorrow
The south Bronx //real life Grand theft auto
Hands on  steering wheel/ life is full throttle

Learned to move forward/ just like an engine  /
One my best days/was the original nine eleven/
My life in exile// living below the heavens/
Should be among kings /walking with legends/

It  pleasure and pain/ why should I feel ashamed/
Itâ€™s a Cole World/ brought myself yoga Flame /
That boy you hyping up/ knows  I am Lui Kang/
Chuck norris his ass/when he steps to  my lane/

I know i am out of season /this life feels strange /
Never understanding///;/ please try to  explain
Drunk driving through life; ;;;;;;;;;;; swerving lanes
Gods solider waiting on orders to crash the plane

Hook

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that (X4)
