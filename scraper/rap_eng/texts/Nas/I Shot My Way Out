[Intro]
Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...

[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching my mom's stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, that my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Looking out my belly button window, my father sighs
On his face he wears a frown, and I'm wondering
If they even want me around, as I go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down the chute again
In the near future when
Mom and pops could agree on this, was here before
But my mom saw her gynecologist, he dumped me off
First they want me, then turn around and say they don't
You got 120 days, do what y'all want
But as for me, coming back, this be the last time
Abort me, keep me or give me away, make up your minds

[Hook 4X: Nas]
I shot my way out my mom dukes

[Verse 2]
They must wanna keep me, 'cause 4 months passed, I'm still alive
Guess I got what they call Ill Will to survive
When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes
I know when mom's laying down, I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food, flowing through my mother's tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my mom's voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born, will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get out, and grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, '73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms "Push, and take deep breaths, too"
"Stay calm," holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screamed out
Tears pouring down my pop's face, he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said "At least that nigga ain't ugly!"
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me
And, yo, I plan to over throw the devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers...
