[Verse 1: Kv$per]
It was all dream
Now I'm putting that dream into reality
I spend too long just doing this wealth
I'm passionate about what I do;
Sorta like Steve Jobbs, it cost him his health
But it won't kill me
I'll be Young Forever because I got that BluePrint 3
Made by Hova, Marcy Projects;
NYC birthplace of how many classic's?
Something like Reebok, or maybe originals we can Adidas
They say I'm best fuck yea they mean it
I'm like Michael Phelps just not an Olympian yet
I don't got 22 medals, but a infinite voice box
The larynx, God blessed me with it;
So I better not choke on the mic
Everybody wanna be a Biggie or 2Pac
But be yourself and maybe you'll be too hot
But don't think you the shit, because I'll be around to scoop you up real quick;
I'll put you in my lunchbox take you to school eat you at lunchtime and nickname you food
The system is fucked up, what we gonna do?
I'm going to call on them Dead Presidents to represent me to;
To represent me to I'mma call on the Presidents to represent me too

[Bridge; Nas]
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
I'm out for Dead Presidents to represent me [2x]

[Verse 2: Kv$per]
Ignorance at it's Best
One real nigga never laid to rest;
Fuck that ya'll know what I meant
You mad cuz' you ain't got no strength
Shaved ya head? Can't stand you naps?
Tryna be like French and Meek man they icy
But food stamps were meant for food 'hence the name;
And nothing good ever happens on a rainy day
Man life is so predctable not sike!
Things could get worse and you could end up on site
Friends I don't have 'em
I'm more of the lonely stoner wandering Day & Nite
Oh you could rap yea that's nice;
But any clown can buy a mic and say they shit in the booth
This nigga manager well she going to work too;
But we be getting money so it has to be Illuminati
And we so 'bout it 'bout it now what are you about
We be getting money, call me Mr. Steve Harvey only if the Price is Right
I'll be there just tell me when & where
Just tell me when and where I'll be there
Just tell me when and where

[Outro: Nas]
Dead Presidents to represent me [x4]
I'm our for presidents to represent me [x7]
I'm our for Dead Presidents to represent me
