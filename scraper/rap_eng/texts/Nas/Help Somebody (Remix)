[Verse 1]
There's a moving inner peace that I love to see
Gotta raise my soul to tell you how I feel
Gotta listen to the tears that people cry for me
In a world that's so wild fear creeps

Cause when I get up to hear you, tears just fill my eyes
Now I know I got to let the selfishness subside
Tell 'em y'all

[Chorus]
Help somebody, help somebody
Show 'em what it is, give a little bit more
Help somebody, help somebody
Show 'em what it is, let 'em know

[Interlude]
If you see the future, ask it if I'm there
Ask it if I'm there

[Verse 2]
Ask it to tell you did I ever make a stand
Ask if you may care to mention, did I learn from everything?
And even if it takes a sea of eternity to know
I'll wait a century, a buried mess of bones, help me

Help me to give myself the way that you've given you
Help me to be the helping hand that makes a dream come true
Choir, sing

[Chorus]
Help somebody, help somebody
Show 'em what it is, give a little bit more
Help somebody, help somebody
Show 'em what it is, let 'em know

[Bridge]
If I'm there, yea
Tell me if I'm there
Do you see me there?
Do you see me there?

[Chorus]
Help somebody, help somebody
Show 'em what it is, give a little bit more
Help somebody, help somebody
Show 'em what it is, let 'em know

[Interlude]
If you see the future, ask it if I'm there
Ask it if I'm there

[Verse: Nas]
Yeah, Yeah
My degrees
Like Ivy Leagues
In the street
I succeeded
The ghetto was my Garden of Eden
It was hard to defeat him
The Beast
He tried to turn the god in to a heathen

Check It

See the Black Madonna the picture, that lady
Holding a baby?
As I looked in her eyes, what I saw did it amaze me
New Orleans under water
Screaming, "Somebody save me"
Immigrants at the border
Treated wronger than Dalo-Faelid
In India, there's plenty of poor crying babies
Back at the home front, jobs wanted like crazy
Me, I'm never selfish, indeed help the helpless
Looking at the sky for Almighty, can you help us?
I can't stress what I can't control
Heart of a street hustler, Panther soul
As I sit on the throne
What's not in the stars, I just let it go
Favorite Golf linen clothes
So I pray to God... That a new plan unfolds
I got a saying and it goes
"I started in the projects
Now look what I accomplished"
There's ain't nobody helped me
It's nonsense
I'm just
Honored
To be in this position
The best feeling
That I've ever had is when I'm giving
Listen
