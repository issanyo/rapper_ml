Yo..
Is it ill, do it need to be fixed?
(That shit is real Dunn; and stop talkin like your skills don't kill)
Nah it's just that sometimes I feel like that
I can write more fouler than the last

[Prodigy's "Conscience"]
Yo that shit is cash trust me Dunn; I'll never lead you astray
Take my word niggas wanna hear how you think
It be that shit that you wouldn't expect to win
That stay playin' in they decks over and again
Speak your thoughts, put your all in it
Whatever's in your mind, spit it
Place your anger on the page, release tension on the tape
A stress verse, seem to be what they most thirst
Makes fake niggas disperse, they never challenge what works

[Prodigy]
Balancin' the weakness, is what I specialize in
Dunn you my nigga, 'cause you keep me hype when I'm writin'
Kept me on point in the night when it might go down
Keep me eyes wide in the daytime as well
Kept me focused on what's real and nuthin' else
I find it healthy, to conversate with myself
I kick it with my delf (I kept you alive, all these years)
It's that inner voice you shoulda' took heed to and shit
Coulda' been home instead of bleedin'
Maybe next time you'll listen when it speaks

[Prodigy's "Conscience"]
Yo Dunn, I got a story to tell
Remember last week's mission? I told you bring the gun
(Yeah I remember) Nah listen, without me you'd be a memory
I'm the one you could come to for guidance
Bring you home alive when you wildin'
Kept you out of harm's way, told you when to spray
Told you when it's time to put it away
And when the cops came, you was safe

[Prodigy]
Without question, I stay aware Dunn I'm listenin'
Everytime we speak it's real, I know your intentions
To make sure we both safe, livin' and breathin'
You gets all respect from me Dunn, believe it

[Prodigy's "Conscience"]
Yo we got kids to raise and bills to pay
Enemies to lay down when they stand in our way, it's only us
(What about the clique?) Now if you die is they comin'?
When you shot do they feel the bullet?
And when you broke can they fix it? Aight then, you keep writin'
And let me do the thinkin', I brought us this far without mistaken

[Nas]
Voices in my head from choices that I dreaded choosin'
Cautions I shoulda took heed, lost in my weed, steady losin
Thug stripes, badges of honor, forces to succeed
Whores on they knees, fuckin' with millionaires, killers and thieves
I fuck until there's no feelin' where, I bust and I pee
I lusted cars but I suffered and my scars run deep
I stay to myself, one deep, pray to my God cause he
Say when it's hard get on one knee, and ask Thy for forgiveness
Fuck the cash, the ice, the Ferraris
With two-twenty on the dash when your life ain't right
See niggas smile up in your face and stick a knife in your back
Snakes shake your hand and got his dick up in your wife back
Why's it like that? It's life black and this is the game
The way I see it both bitches and niggas, is the same
I trust myself, I can't fuck myself
When hoes leave and no weed I still know me, just myself
Fear is weakness learn from what experience teaches
Beware of leeches, the vampires, my secrets
Never follow, 'cause most niggas is straight up cowards
Take care of my body's the temple, my mind is the power
