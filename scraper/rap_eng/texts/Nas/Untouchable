Yeah, I'd like to welcome everybody that came. I know that I
Woke y'all up early this morning, but shit is real, I needed all
Y'all to come down, so we can talk about these things thats
Going on man. It's gettin real

[Wizard]
Escobar repertoire, that's my man
Blowin up, how we expand
Stack grands up pack vans up with wild cats
Bustin loud gats
Claimin that you iller than me, now how's that
In the bridge hangin with the thugs menaces
Images of mad loot and beating sentences
Now we livin large reminiscin flippin on prison guards
Jumpin in and out of different cars
On a weekly Benz or Mitsubishi
Got the flip phone and the scripts on
Satellite dish, 50 inch with the Knicks on
Everyday it's real in my life, you live a sitcom
Real dons, bustin out this hustlin game with the name
See it in lights, bitch get it right
Scorsese, capo, black Mercedes
Miami in back with the crack, the late 80's
Brown Timbs and thousands
Now we on to some real dough
How does it feel to count a mil?
What you above? Throw a party and show love
To the same cats after your stacks who throw slugs
