Ruk:
Ill Will...yeah yeah yo...Queensbridge niggas...crud love baby..

Verse 1: (Ruk)
Aiyo, I zone out
Feelin' like I'm in Capone's house
Starin' at Manhattan and The Bridge with the chrome out
Ki's on the table, black tanktop, long cable
Thoughts of overtakin' the table
Dismantle and disable
Verbal, made fatal, what drug paper do
Straight duct tapin', apin' a few
Takin' Mo' and Henny straight and things loose
Puffin' the fruits, thug in a duece
Flaggin', pants saggin', fuckin' ya goose
I'm like nothin' to you
Dumpin' the Rug' and your group in a red coog'
Jump in the Isuzu and cruise
Blank tints, bulletproof, red Timb boots
Nigga loose, license plate screamin' "Fuck you"
Drunken days, I wish ya'll knew
Thug dreams, what it means to you
Red seams, triple beams
40 inch blings, Ill Will the fuckin' team
This for my niggas in the Bridge from Queens

Verse 2: (Nas)
Bumpy Johnson style, old timers, crocodile shoes
Pinky rings, big rounders with tools, bossin' wild crews
Slacks, overlaps, applejack hats quarterfield coats
Cadillacs with white walls and chrome wheel spokes
They were organized, investin', had a piece of the hood
They had drugs, bettin' numbers, police understood
They played the Cotton club, red carpet, hoes on they arm
Plush mink, pimped out gangsta, civil rights wasn't won
Every Christmas they were Santa Claus, Nixon was the Anti-Christ
Bitches asses were bigger then, sniffin' nose candy white
Listenin' to Malcolm speak, talcum powder, shaving cream
Layin' back, barber chair, straight razor clean
Babies were born, big families started to blossom
Mad people just applied for apartments and got 'em
Used to be rules to this game of hustlers and dealers
From Tommy guns to MAC Tens it's Q.B.'s newborn killers

Verse 3: (Ruc)
96 buildings of children, guns, and bad feelings
Q.B. see we rep by the Millions
Each block, ten spots, a hundred different villians
In abundance my dunnettes run this drug dealin'
Stash the jums in hallway ceilings
Gangsta paradise, watch the ice, nigga make a killin'
In the cut on the steps yo gettin' good neck
Only in the projects, we die with respect
Pussy niggas quiet as kept will riot the set
Six blocks of real niggas vexed
Assorted irons and vests, stress on they chest
20 half a G's on Henny, Son, the whole hood is wet
In memory of...who's next?
Train they set, lend they Teck, earn your check
Nigga, you better rep
Real niggas come out the projects
40 to the 41st, Vernon to the 12th
