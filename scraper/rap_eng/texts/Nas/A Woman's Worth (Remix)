[Verse 1]
You can buy me diamonds and buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
A dozen roses ‘cause I’m your girl
And you know I’m worth it (uh huh) worth it
Dinner lit by candles under sun
Run my bubble bath ‘cause I’m the one
You want to love so tenderly
And you know I’m worth it (say what) I’m worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna to please wanna to keep wanna to treat your woman right
Not just doe but a show let you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will find a man who knows a worth

[Chorus]
So all my real woman, throw your hands up
All my real men, wave your hands
If you feel me, then clap your hands
If you’re worth it, worth it
So all my real woman, throw your hands up
All my real men, wave your hands
All my peoples, who understand
Represent your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman’s worth

[Verse 2]
If you treat me fairly I’ll give you my goods
Show you all the things no one else would
Treat you like a real woman should
‘Cause I know you’re worth it (say what) your worth it
If you never play me, now don’t you bluff
I promise you can get it all
I’ll hold you now when shit gets rough
‘Cause I know your worth it (say what) your worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna to please wanna to keep wanna to treat your woman right
Not just doe but a show let you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will find a man who knows a worth

[Chorus]
So all my real woman, throw your hands up
All my real men, wave your hands
If you feel me, then clap your hands
If you’re worth it, worth it
So all my real woman, throw your hands up
All my real men, wave your hands
All my peoples, who understand
Represent your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman’s worth

[Interlude: Alicia Keys & (Nas)]
Da-da-da-da-da
(All my real woman, put your hands up)

[Verse 3: Nas]
It's like I'm the Rikers and you the Island
We stuck together until the verdict
Big dreams in tiny windows, trapped behind bars, your love is murder
And I'd die just to come back as an angel and look over you
‘Cause I know what the most high got planned for us, more than mostly true
I stay close to you, spray clips, empty 50 at anybody is nothing
Many women that try me, none of them the wifey type
But they're looking for a husband, I guess that's what they're supposed to do
But I'm good, I'mma toast to you, because you with me in the trenches
So why I gotta cheat when I got a freak at home?
She my queen and my ho and my mistress
And she know how to split the dutch up, break the green up, roll up the leaf and clean up
Drive while I ride on enemies, rock the wheel with one hand and blow the heater
She a bad motherfucka, hot to def, so you know that I need her
If you know you're a bad bitch, put your hands up to this jam by Nas and Alicia

[Chorus]
So all my real woman, throw your hands up
All my real men, wave your hands
If you feel me, then clap your hands
If you’re worth it, worth it
So all my real woman, throw your hands up
All my real men, wave your hands
All my peoples, who understand
Represent your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman’s worth
