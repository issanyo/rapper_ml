[Verse 2: Nas]
We celebrate like I finished probation, boy boy
Knotty Head with no chaser, boy boy
From the mouth I can spit out a razor, boy boy
Open up your facial like your boy Roy
In his prime
Eat food, dinnertime
Jr. Gong pass the Guinness
Handle business, black Velvet sippers
Females never bid us farewell, they with us
Cause we arrive on the scene just like a high beam
Nah Mean
Don't let us have to make the 9 scream
Nah Mean
At your racial policing regime
Nah Mean
Spiritual like a Elohim
Nah Mean
In a casino or a yacht wherever I'm seen
My brothers and sisters are never forgot
Nah Mean
Don't wanna hear another soldier drop
Nah Mean
Another dope addict get shot with the morphine
And Feds are indicting my block
Nah Mean
They're wearing red from they shoes to they top
Nah Mean
I'm wishing that all the violence would stop
Nah Mean

[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
We nuh like the sound of siren

Nah Mean
The world is a big crime scene
Nah Mean

[Verse 4: Damian Marley]
Say man a di real Buffalo inna Rastafari regime
Bush Bungalow is where mi dwell with mi Queen
Trash to the bone down inna camouflage green
Nuff a dem that can't go the places we been
Nuff a dem that can't see the sights that we seen
That's why them face all a twist up and a lean

Dem better mind we kick it off clean
Nah Mean

Run out a breath and antihistamine
Nah Mean
Wash over gold dem come in like Listerine
Nah Mean
You think a lie we badder than Al Pacine
Nah Mean

[Verse 5: Nas]
It's genocide, it's a Genocide
It's a genocide, it's a genocide
Fifth floor cooking raw had my own supply
Cause of capitalist ways, that was back in the days
So now I do rap and it pays
