Woke up in New York City lying on the floor
Just outside of Marcy's - West 54 "wow"
You gonna know my name by the end of the night "well"
You gonna know my name by the end of the night "well"

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care no, no
You don't care, no

Start up with the bottle
End it up with the bottle
Taking shots, waiting on tomorrow
Trying to fill up, what's hollow
You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care no, no
Cause you don't care, no

Get lost in this city, try to find myself
I went up a different person
Came down somebody else
I know it ain´t right
But its all in my head
Wow I'm surprised
I'm still alive I should be dead

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care no, no
You don't care, no

You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name by the end of the night, well…
