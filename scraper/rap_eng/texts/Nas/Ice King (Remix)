[Verse 1: Nas]
Nas the Ice King never seen twice the same spot
An introvert, watch like Yasser Arafat
I was the playboy up in every Marriott
And every Holiday Inn with somebody's girlfriend
The ladies started saying, Nas he get around
I thought about it and decided I should settle down
Met my little p but how am I gonna share my crown
Baby I'm the king I make the rules here on out

[Res]
Although you're an Ice King
Everything that you gave to me
Comes from the destitute and the torn
I can't live this life no more

Just another wasted one
Like a fallen star in Babylon
You said I was your princess, baby
I told you certain things you can't possess
So let me go, let me go

[Verse 2: Nas]
Here we go, yo
Now rollin on 22s, top down, seat back
Listening to slow grooves where gangsters be at
Watch say twelve, cop play themselves
Circling the corners like they got something on us
That's when my girl paged me, you ain't Kizzi and
I ain't Kunta, this ain't slavery, is you crazy?
There ain't no ties here that ain't my baby

[Res]
I've given until I break
The ground beneath us quakes
How can we grow when we've only begun
Forsaken beneath the sun

Although you're an Ice King
Everything that you gave to me
Comes from the destitute and the torn
I can't live this life no more
