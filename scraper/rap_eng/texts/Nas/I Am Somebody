[Intro]
Come along children
Now we're going to have a little music
Like old times

[Verse 1: Bliss]
Straight out the gate
This is our story we're scripting
Our film, our glorious vision
Our sound, our score that is written
In this sport, this division
My my, how the tournament's risen
Shit, everybody wants to soar in an instant
Everybody wants to be the Lord of the Ring wins
We laid dormant and listened
Hit ignition, tore up the system
Elevate, accelerate and demonstrate
Live the dream and keep the horns to the mission
The formula's mixing to fire the
Engine up and bring the force to the pistons
Never say never whenever together we give and go
With the flow flipping like Jordan and Pippen
Slam the points home
Incite a roar to ignite the board
Wipe the floor with the notes that we write
And hold down with a mic to strike a chord
And then they can hear that thunder with the hooves
When we come with the hunger of the wolves
They were warned and the red flag flew
And his crewed cracked through, it's the running of the bulls

Today, we are together
Whenever we come together
The writers write
The cameras roll
Because together we got power
That's just rappin'

[Chorus: Bliss n Eso]
I said
Ay yo, I'mma
Lay my tracks down, I'm that
Freight train tearing through the
Sky in the clouds, I said
Ay yo, watch this
Hail mary fly, keep on
Runnin' keep on gunnin' with this
Fire in my eyes, and I'm
Sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (yeah, together)
Welcome to the time of my life (raise your fists high)
I'm sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (together)
Welcome to the time of my life

[Verse 2: Eso]
Sun, rain, snow or hail
We never got lost in the storm
And you best to respect that you
Never really know what you've got till it's gone
And a monster was born
With a want to explore
Life's roughest weather
But we know the code so we stuck together, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
And as life unravels
My mind's what fights my battles
I rhyme like lightning travels
Think quick, how you like them apples
Cuz I'm ready as I'll ever be, my head is in the
Melody, I'm flyingn now each
Feather is so heavenly, the energy of seven
Seas couldn't tie me down, bitch
So no fucking around dumb
Cunt, one jump and I'm up in the clouds
Trying to make that moment last
On a beat like Heath in a Joker mask
Which means, don't change that dial
Could've, would've, should've, just ain't our style
Shit, we got things to build
If your luck's low just know your wings are real

[Chorus: Bliss n Eso]
I said
Ay yo, I'mma
Lay my tracks down, I'm that
Freight train tearing through the
Sky in the clouds, I said
Ay yo, watch this
Hail mary fly, keep on
Runnin' keep on gunnin' with this
Fire in my eyes, and I'm
Sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (yeah, together)
Welcome to the time of my life (raise your fists high)
I'm sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (together)
Welcome to the time of my life

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, yo
I'm so ill in my timeless timepiece
I keep a dime piece in arm's reach
Keep it 1000
From the housing projects I found my niche, you better
Find yours, I used to run with a few
Crime lords, Ramadan taught me use the
Mind more, though I'm not religious
Nas y'all, just the realist
My imminent, conspicuous
Synonym, sincere, rhyme and flow
Developed some images up in your
Mind bro, I survived continuing
Criminal enterprises that
Surrounded me, innocent, no
Exaggeration, I don't pimp my
Past, I don't brag, no faking
My apartment had some break-ins
I'm thinking my past is worse than today is
That's when Biz Mark came with the vapours
It was anarchy, live in a heartbeat
Of the city that never sleeps
Niggas will gas you up to handle their beef
Peep game, you're dead if you don't think
Fast enough, we keeping it way
Street

[Chorus: Bliss n Eso]
I said
Ay yo, I'mma
Lay my tracks down, I'm that
Freight train tearing through the
Sky in the clouds, I said
Ay yo, watch this
Hail mary fly, keep on
Runnin' keep on gunnin' with this
Fire in my eyes, and I'm
Sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (yeah, together)
Welcome to the time of my life (raise your fists high)
I'm sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (together)
Welcome to the time of my life

[Bridge: Bliss n Eso]
And my god, I feel alright
And my god, I feel alright, hey
And my god, I feel alright
And my god, I feel alright, hey
(Real hip-hop)

[Chorus: Bliss n Eso]
I said
Ay yo, I'mma
Lay my tracks down, I'm that
Freight train tearing through the
Sky in the clouds, I said
Ay yo, watch this
Hail mary fly, keep on
Runnin' keep on gunnin' with this
Fire in my eyes, and I'm
Sky high
I'm sky high, yeah
Welcome to the time of my life
I'm sky high
I'm sky high, yeah
Welcome to the time of my life

And my god, I feel alright
(together, raise your fists high)
And my god, I feel alright, hey

[Spoken Outro]
Our experiences determine the texture, the pace, and the sound of our soul. All of us are one people singing our music, pumping our thing up, and doing our thing. Let's give ourselves a great round of applause
