[Hook 2X]
Dog shit, I shit you not
You bring that larceny, danger or harm around me
Dog shit, listen to me good
We the grand goons, you just a lickle nickel dime hood

[Verse 1 - Prodigy]
I’m the epitome slimeball, fuck up out my eyesight
Fuck is on your brain? Dog shit? I’m not the clown type
Die fore I let a nigga play me, like I’m baby shit
Dog shit, you deaf, dumb or blind, I’m the craziest
Most Infamous rapper outta Now Why
Jealous of my shine, the truth is in your eyes
You wanna be down, I might allow you to work for me
The key words: “work for me”, I put your ass in surgery
Ever step outta line, forget who's boat you ride
Forget who train you ride
Forget who flag you fly
Read the name on it, Mobb Deep
P and Hav run this, employees get fired with some gun fire if it call for it
A thousand niggas couldn’t stop me once I get to going
You can have a nation of millions, still wouldn’t hold me back
Still wouldn’t be lethal as Bumpy the Mack
Matter fact…

[Hook 2X]
Dog shit, I shit you not
You bring that larceny, danger or harm around me
Dog shit, listen to me good
We the grand goons, you just a lickle nickel dime hood

[Verse 2 - Havoc]
Once we get it going steam rolling over them
Drunk off the drama, ain't no way that you can sober them
Fuck outta here, you outta here, soul lift
Slugs leave a nigga open like a coke sniff
You know our music got these niggas into dope fiends
No intervention could get them off of they OD
Grand royal, all my goons you see loyal
Dedicated in the cut, wait weeks for you
And when they finally discover you
They gon' need a dental record, you've been dead a month or two
Post mortem, shriveled up, how dare us
We penalize traitors and only hail trust
Inhale piff and guzzle white liquor
I don't know you, you don’t know me, you’s a lie, nigga
I can see the tears in your eye
You ain't see nothing till you seen a grown man cry

[Hook 2X]
Dog shit, I shit you not
You bring that larceny, danger or harm around me
Dog shit, listen to me good
We the grand goons, you just a lickle nickel dime hood

[Verse 3 - Nas]
Yo, every gang, every hood’s in my veins
It’s my thing, it’s real, I’m in tune
I chill like the cold side of the moon
Silence you dudes like an empty room
Empty out with silencers
You get murdered like Albert was in a saloon
Anastasia that is
Haters can’t live, talking about they putting 8 in my wig
I got my dollars up, try your luck, you die, no trial for us
Court appointed lawyers as foul as fuck and I’m too fly
Cause when you’re locked in prison, your clock stop ticking
Now, you came home look the same age you went in
Mentality wise, get iller when boxed in
Fresh home, and right off top, you get it popping
Freedom is a virtue, niggas hanging way past they parole curfew
Blowing on that purple, know my street ties, beef wise
I let three fly over your head, Welcome home P
Let's get this bread, dog shit

[Hook 2X]
Dog shit, I shit you not
You bring that larceny, danger or harm around me
Dog shit, listen to me good
We the grand goons, you just a lickle nickel dime hood
