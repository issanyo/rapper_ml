Presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me

[Verse 1: Ian Jazzi]
Wa hu saa paper naa y3 di Big Six abor so nu

They call it hustlin we call it tso bway tso bway hey hey
No play play asotwann but enny3 agoro
Jee na ashwer okee m3ni?
It wasn't all good just a week ago
Felii felii you go feel am with less than one ghana
For ur pocket, lef the spot, find some kenkey n chop it
Can't even afford the fish, mobomobo
But still keep it fly like a dorkordorkor
As long as ice water dey I was chillin
While sweatin' walking the street
Got no time for beef like I be rastaman
Cuz I be chasin for the kudi like a runawayman
Madman but I try not to be too desperate
No no no mama raised me well. hell yeah
A warrior disguised as a gentleman for the sake of being polite
Im tryna make that corporate paper so I put on a tie
I did research well got ma homework done enti baa na ma baa
E no bi noko bibiooo, I'm here to take it all have it all unlike Oliver I ain't askin I'm here to take what's mine
Cuz its about time that I got what I deserve

Wa hu saa paper naa y3 di bigsix abor so nu
Its why reason why y3 slangi slangi
Anka Asanti kor y3 d3n wor hamburg ni New York
If not for the deutschmarks. Green
Roll it up n now he feelin high a kite
That explains why the pimpinees high a kite
Holla
Don't we all want the good life?
And the finer things top that up with a beautiful wife
Good house, good wine, good money
With the access to everything
That we need? hehe I wish it was that easy tho
Cuz see what we got here is all up side down n oh
Its so crazy n oh its so shady n oh its annoying
Abuu fuo paa am3 wo emii la thats why I'm all up in flames
Too hot so don't come too close you must stop
Step outta the way or you might drop
Down to the ground defeated like a dead body
Cold world so expect no love
Cold world got us cold like dead bodies
Dead presidents big six dead bodies
Got us chasing after vapour like dead bodies
Look around me and no dedicated buddies
Everybody's busy looking for a pot to piss in

[Hook]

Wo hu saa paper naa y3 di big six abor su no?
Aaaane from the red to the brown
Wo nya bi aa you can go from rags to the crown
Obiaa y3 wild, eye red - kotoko
The reason why they break into your krib with no kokoko
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer
So those in the middle can afford to live proper
Whatever happened to equal rights to justice?
Yeah it only sounds good in theory
We practise a dog eat dog world out here yeah
Yaa bi na agba bo
