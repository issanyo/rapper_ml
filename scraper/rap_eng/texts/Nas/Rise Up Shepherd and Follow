There's a star in the east on xmas morn
It will lead you to the place that the savior's born

[bridge]
Leave your ewe's and leave your rams
Leave your sheep, and leave your lambs
Follow, follow
Follow thou star of bethlehem

Rise up shepherd and follow (follow)
If you take a good heed to the angel's word
You'll forget your flocks, you'll forget your herds

[bridge]
Leave your ewe's and leave your rams
Leave your sheep and leave your lambs
Follow, follow
Follow the star of bethlehem

Rise up shepherd, rise and follow

Rise up (x8)

[Nas]
Yeah I'm the noble one
Obi wan kenobi one
Drunk mind speaking sober toungue
About the Holy One
Spread the word spread the word
Y'all Christ is born
The devil's rule over earth now is soon gone
So let the [??] burn y'all been warned
2000 years ago now the angels sound the horn
No crown of thorns, bow down praise him
New god flow? nah, but my style's amazing
[??] my army suit's my tuxedo
I'm a ghetto prophet to my people
A ghetto peace adonis
Criminal mind but at least I'm honest
So i seek what the savior promised
Then i climb where i can stand the highest
So i can tell it to every man woman and child what the time is
We sending this to all nations, the birth of Christ calls for celebration! yeah
