[45 seconds of talking/skit]

[Verse 1]
It was a murder
Jake just hit the corner people swarming
Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like "Fuck
Niggas is buck," mega bloodshed, the tape's red
I heard some bird whisper, "Yo he should have ducked"
I puffed the lila, just before I hit the scene for rilla, I'm all high
It's late I'm looking down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop your life clock
The beast'll time ya, cell to cell, suspect ass nigga you fail
First time locked in Comstock, my mind blocks the frail
Bursting, blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch why tell
We roll with no regrets, destinies, fiftys and equities
Queens'll be the death of me

[Chorus]
To the suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)
Suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)

[Verse 2]
Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested
Giving the jealous niggas sickness to witness
My crew dresses in vests, feel the essence
Try to test this scientist, able and reckless, slaughter
Nautica Down, frames look petite
Ten millis, minks designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely
My pants hang while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Roll the two Phillies together, make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker's psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Tan Clarks, Armani in small print upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon
The wedding of a freak and a beast
Seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, Math we own
Are you the type of nigga to shoot a leg to get your name known?
I flip the brain tone, niggas get hit and wrapped in plastic
The mic I strike in vain, givin' the pain of what a MAC is
What you with? Luchi or drama
No sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets'll time ya

[Chorus]
Suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah
It justifies Nas Escobar's leavin' shit mesmerized
Mega live, like the third world
Decipher my deceiver make him a believer
Spitting gem stars, words in my mic type receiver
Bond is my life so I live by my word
Never fraudulent Queensbridge don't make no herbs
Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin'
Rebel to America civilization, caught you sleepin'

[Outro]
(Queensbridge, boy, once again, boy
Recognize boy, recognize, stupid motherfuckers)
Street educated, created
Fly gangsta, Firm style
AZ, what up, what up?
Jungle, Benny Blanco from the Bridge
Mega, Big Hi, clap 'em down
L.E.S. on a murder quest, yeah yeah y'all
