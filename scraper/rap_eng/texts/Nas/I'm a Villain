[Intro: Nas & Jae Supreme]
Yo, Nas whattup?
Whattup kid?
What going on Ill
I'm just tryna tell these brothers where I'm coming from
You know what I'm saying
Alright, kick it

[Verse 1]
I'm the nigga walking with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testing
Gimme a Smith-N-Wesson I'll have niggas undressing
I'm rolling with a mob and running from the cops
Drive stolen cars and shoot many Glocks
A marijuana addict, if niggas want static
They had it, 'cause I flip just like an acrobatic
I'm always on the corners rolling up Sess
When I dress it's never nothing less than Guess
So I walk with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
I got it going on, my knuckle game is strong
Sip Dom Pérignon and then carry on
Army certifieds, keep a Rent-A-Ride
Stripping mad hoes and kick em to the side
See I'm the type of brother who keeps a four-pounder
Start a lot of shit and shoot at out-of-towners
At every block party, I try to catch a body
All for props, tell your pops call the cops
See now I'm on the run, but still having fun
Living by the MAC, my gear is all black
I keep killing because I'm ready and I'm willing and I'm a villain

[Hook]
What?
What?
Wha-a-a-t?

[Verse 2]
I got beef with the President and still loving it
Trying to make plans to overthrow the government
It won't work cause niggas don't believe enough
They'd rather stand on the corners and receive a cuff
Around they wrist, you don't like the sound of this
Rebel, but my country doesn't want me
They'd rather hunt me but you'll never catch us all
While you fucking with the dealers we'll be sticking up the malls
Full of anger, all about danger
Pulling out my banger, stabbing up a stranger
I hear Walkie Talkies in my sleep
And use a whole lot of slang when I speak
Walking with a vest, the projects is where I rest
And the streets keep me stressed
Staring at your face, wait for you to make a sound
That's when I take you down, shoot you up and suit you up
All in black and put you in a box
A hard rock with a .25 in my socks
Aiming at your temple so take the diamonds off your hands
I'm buckwild like Billy Bear and Ganz
Prince of pistoleers, words are crystal clear
And this you should fear
The maniac keeps killing, I'm known as a outlaw 'cause I'm a villain

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I keep bullets racing out the barrels of a Magnum
Put 'em to sleep and leave the doctors to tag them
An outlaw, although I never wear a holster
In every town you see my face is on a poster
Hear so many gunshots my eardrums should pop
Eyesight should stop from seeing mad niggas drop
To the concrete, I got police putting chalk on the street
And this is done once a week
I'm out to kill like Navy Seals
I'm crazy ill and what I can't do my .380 will
I never play with a AK
Because I'm fine with a .9 and if caught I'll do lesser time
Sometimes you gotta plan shit and understand it
See I'm a bandit whose hand'll itch
Without a gun in it, Nas is running it
I stay blunted, I'm the project's most wanted
My voice is like magic
My cassette is the clip and your radio's the Automatic
So when I'm in your town, "duck down"
Or take fire, whatever you desire
But I'm on point you might miss
Never fight this, you'll be sightless when I strike this
So roll the dice, I'm stopping the bank
It's ill how I got the pen dropping the ink
No one can stop this apocalypse
On your record player a method layer so run and tell your Mayor
Nas the parlayer, you better say your prayer
I'm the New York City slayer
I play high post and then lay low
Parlé slow and wear horns, not a halo
And keep killing 'cause I'm a villain
