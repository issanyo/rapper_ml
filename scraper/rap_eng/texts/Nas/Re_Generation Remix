[Verse: Nas]
Yeah, ya'll know I gets it on, sip on Dom
Clear the throat, wet the palate
Compose a ballet, then expose a rare talent
The kick drum will have you numb, the snare's valid
That's how Premier styles it
Yeah ya'll know he gets it on, that's a given
Every song I've written, make the sky clear blue
Like the beginning scenes of The Simpsons
Dominions of the British Empire
We'll listen to Bach, with tea and biscuits
Preem revisits, songs centuries old
Hip-Hop; symphony's orchestras out cold with it
You know the flow's administered
By the deputy, rhyme prime-minister
Sir Nas, I'm certified
Please be seated and your shirt and tie, dress is on
Arrive early, when the curtains rise, bet it's on
A certain etiquette involved with this
Unlike any other music genre is, bring the drama in

[Verse: Apathy]
I'm an abomination, an atom bomb
My verse is atomic
Approaching the planet with power of a herdling comet
My words are demonic
I'll make the pope convert to islamic
Converse with the prophet and tell the planet earth that i'll﻿ drop it
Into a bottomless black hole
I'll body a wack flow
A cannibal with bottles of blood instead of Tabasco
The bastard of base and battery acid and sewage
I'm secret as druids
I cover hoes with bodily fluids
I'll leave a city in ruins
This is not an illusion
I'm a product of parents abuse and a lot of hallucenogens
I sacrifice hoes,to beg gettin broke
I'm a beast with the body of a bull and the head of a goat
I lunge for the throats pyscotic when my lungs full of smoke
A dragon puffin on dope,we live in dungeons and moats
See us covered in﻿ cloaks
A dagger stuck in your throat
So call me pacman
I turn these muthafuckas to ghost!
