Mylene:
In my room staying up late
And I'm planning my escape
Cause I know I canÂ´t stay
In my veins, I got the feeling
There must be something more
Never been so sure

All night and day
I dream of a place
Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
Out of the darkness, we can shine
I'm packing my bags
I'm gonna leave it all behind
I wanna open up my eyes
And see you on the other side

Ezekiel:
Life is a test
It will break you or
drive you, to the ground
In the game of survival
Take a look around in my town
All the kings, the crowns
The tools will provide you
Find yourself in a strange place
Where it's too late to about face
When you're going through emotions
When you're going through it
With the ones you were close with
We was street brothers
Riding the trains
And the subway tunnels are the veins
in the body of the city
Underground I remain
Me and my brothers, we reign
Who woulda knew our cold fate?
Who woulda knew my soulmate
would have wings to fly,
leaving me with heartache?
And now she's the queen of the party
And I knew one day I'd see her
In the flesh or next life, I'll meet her
Till then, my sweetheart, I swear
Nothing shall make me stop

What happens when you was just laughing?
What happens when a struggling artist
turns to a rich has-been?
What did I miss?
My brothers used to cut up and mix, Shaolin
It's funny
The money, the glamor, the glitz
In the horizon, envious guys watchin'
Suddenly my brothers and me are divided
Where am I headed to?
It's about to be the '80s
The master of ceremony
Will miss his golden lady
Hope she don't betray me

We both started off with a wish
Suddenly it turned into this
Yeah, stardom is seductive
Temporarily broken-hearted
But regardless
I am stuck with hope
That I will see you in the future
I know, that we will be on top
So, here we go
No matter if I live or die
I Promise Imma meet you on the other side

Mylene:
Here it goes
Clear my throat and cue the violins
Making moves
Shouting from the rooftops
I'm turning to you, yeah

Somewhere far far away
beyond the crowds and city lights
out of the darkness, we can shine

Mylene & Chorus:
Somewhere far far away
beyond the crowds and city lights
out of the darkness, we can shine

So I'm packing my bags
I'm gonna leave it all behind
I wanna open up my eyes
And see you on the other side

Ezekiel:
I promise I meet you on the other side

Mylene:
And see you on the other side
