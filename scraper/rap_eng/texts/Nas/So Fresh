Put on my best
I can't believe that she's so fresh
If she is impressed
This could be the start to my happiness

She seem so fly
Born in '88 and the girl knows why
She is better than the rest
Let me show you

(Chorus)
Ain't no lover like the one I got
I don't need to fuck around 'cause she gives me a lot
Ain't no lover like the one I got
You are the baddest thing up in this club

Baby, I got what you need
And anything you want, I promise I'll please you
Shorty, I am impressed with the things that you do
Start with your hair down to your shoes

Baby, I am falling super deep in your love and I like it
I ain't never felt this way before
Shorty, I hope that you can hear what I am saying
Damn you are so sexy, I love it when you do that things

When I get that feeling I want sexual healing
Sexual healing makes me feel so fine
Oh, baby helps to relieve my mind
Let me show you

(Chorus)
Ain't no lover like the one I got
I don't need to fuck around 'cause she gives me a lot
Ain't no lover like the one I got
You are the baddest thing up in this club

Ain't nothing better
I wanna love you
This way forever
If you let me I'll be by your side, just let me show you

(Nas)
Yeah, she was a drug dealer's dream
Shake me good credit for the team
Took a vacation, and looking for an engagement ring
Hot to death, fatty bustin' out the jeans

Oxygen, long as we together girl ain't nobody stoppin' us
Close as we was never fit that snug
Mix matched chick trying to crack a rich black thug
You fly mile club over clouds gettin' wow

So she left me for quite awhile, my vernacular, my style
My aura, the way I walk in the room and grab attention
Along with no henchmen and my music not to mention
That I'm a don with the biggest chain on

And Nas "Rule The World" was her favorite song
But the wildest part of all is how we became friends
I was walking out divorce court, she was strollin' in
She started calling me too raw, saying I'm the best and I'm so

(Chorus)
Ain't no lover like the one I got
I don't need to fuck around 'cause she gives me a lot
Ain't no lover like the one I got
You are the baddest thing up in this club, baby

Everybody saying ain't no lover
Ain't no lover
Everybody saying ain't no lover
Ain't no lover
