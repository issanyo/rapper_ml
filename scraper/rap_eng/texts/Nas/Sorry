[Intro]
Hey, baby
Even though you break my heart
I still love you

[Chorus]
Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me (forgive me)
And you can say, baby (baby)
My baby, can I hold you tonight?
And maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You‚Äôd be Nas

[Verse 1]
Ayo
That bitch is always flippin'
You niggas never listen
We make a perfect team
Balling Jordan and Scottie Pippen
But I'ma let you dip in
That wax sauce drippin‚Äô
Said that when you with a boss bitch, now you can tell the difference
You be like jungle digger
I don't want another nigga
I wanna make you 'bout a legend, but I make you bigger
Tinkerbell, Peter Pan
No bitches badder than me when I pull up
Got 'em screaming like a temper tan'
Ayo, DJ, drop the beat
My gun didn't fall but I drop the heat
I love how we kept it on the low, mad discreet (I'm in a rush!)
Pass me the keys to my jeep (truck)
I hit 'em with it, I‚Äôma kill ‚Äôem with that wine wine
Ain't losin‚Äô watches, but with me, he always find time
We keep it classy when we eatin' it's that fine dine
But between love and hate, baby, it's a fine line

[Chorus]
Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don‚Äôt come easily
Like forgive me (forgive me)
And you can say, baby (baby)
My baby, can I hold you tonight?
And maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'd be Nas

[Verse 2 Nas]
A mack
I used to mack with the MAC on me
Project parties, lights off, mad horny
Dutty wine and feel the gun I'm hidin'
She still grindin' on me, smilin' at me
I'm like "Hi, I'm Nasty"
"God bless ya, met ya'"
Thought you were sexy as ever
Flexing with your ex, I couldn't disrespect ya'
Later on, I undress ya, couldn't wait to sex ya'
Made a nigga wait so long, but it was special
Light travel faster than sound
Lightning strike one second every point two miles
So when you first saw me emerge from a weed cloud
Electricity touch your soul, that's how I get down
Gangsta love
Completing each other
Touching tongues so close, we could breathe for each other
Untouchable boy with the illustrious girl
But maybe being together's too much for the world, sorry

[Chorus]
Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me (forgive me)
And you can say, baby (baby)
My baby, can I hold you tonight?
And maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'd be Nas
