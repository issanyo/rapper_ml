[Verse 1]
Don't know if you got a girl
Don't mean to disrespect
But thoughts of you rule my world
I even dream of you, I swear
Visions of you and I
See you all around my way
Been meaning to say hi
But I'm just way too shy
I gotta make you see this is
More than just a silly crush

[Hook]
(And I) Wonder if you even notice me
(At all) You gotta feel me
(And I) Will love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)

[Verse 2]
All alone at night
I harbor feelings for you
Holding my pillow tight
Sometimes I even touch myself
Imagin' your pleasure baby
Next time I see you I'm
Gonna walk right up to you and
Say what's on my mind
I gotta make you see
This is (more) than just a silly crush

[Hook]
(And I) Wonder if you even notice me
(At all) You gotta feel me
(And I) Will love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)
Just wanna be your girl

[Bridge]
I wonder if you even notice me and
Ooo you gotta feel me
I will love you good
(Just wanna be)
(Just wanna be)
(Just wanna be)
Your girl

[Hook]
(And I) Wonder if you even notice me
(At all) You gotta feel me
(And I) Will love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)

[Refrain]
Oo...
(And I) I wonder, I wonder
(At all) You gotta feel me, yeah
(And I) I will love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)
Wanna be your girl, girl
(Just wanna be)
(Just wanna be)
(Just wanna be)
