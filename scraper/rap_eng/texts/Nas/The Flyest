[Intro: Nas & AZ]
Yeah
Peace king
Peace king
Listen, if they wrote a book on your life
Right
You think anybody'll read it?
No fuckin' doubt!
Let's make history homie
Aight then
You know we brought the hoes, clothes and money rolls to the table
{*laughing*} No, fuckin', doubt
It's time to manifest this
Tuu, we the flyest nigga
Bring it to a whole, y'know?
Gangsta nigga

[Chorus: Shelene Thomas]
Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters

[Verse 1: AZ]
Follow; I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy
The one the playa haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play with me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And fuck niggas, 'cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance

[Chorus: Shelene Thomas (Nas)]
Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes (hoes)
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome (ha)
We the flyest gangsters

[Verse 2: Nas]
I do what I can do when I can do it
Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin'
Live how I live it's only 'cause I been through it
Learn to try it like to eat it and shit, it's nuttin' to it
Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while drivin' outside
I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
'Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin', evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for givin' himself to the Lord
Wonderin' does Faith, think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin'
We ain't these little niggas no more, runnin' dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be havin' they legs shakin', stab 'em, break 'em
I'm Hercules Hercules when havin' relations, the flyest

[Chorus: Shelene Thomas (Nas)]
Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow (uhh)
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes (hoes)
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome (ha)
We the flyest gangsters

[Verse 3: Nas, AZ & Both​​​]
We put this on the, soul of our born, as we hold the Qur'an
Kamikaze style
Older cats coaching us on
Yo, it's kill or be killed
Understand, real'll be real
A forty-shot spectrum make your whole embassy kneel
Identity sealed, protected by our energy shield
And fuck a drop, 'cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed
Close the book
Was taught never expose a crook
Between the knight and the bishop
One'll knock ya rook
I'm a rare breed, never had a fear to lead
I ain't like niggas with sight, too impaired to read
We both hard hit just like Camacho and Vargas, who's a target?
Now watch how we close the market, motherfuckers

[Chorus: Shelene Thomas]
Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters
