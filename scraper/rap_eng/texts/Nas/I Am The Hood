[Intro]
This is your boy Lil B
And Ima speak for the hood
I'm not talking about the people
But I'm talking as if I am the hood, check me out:

[Verse 1]
Most of it so real I can't even explain
Ima talk for the block the block speakin in pain
People walkin on my face, drug dealers in vain
Cars drivin on my heart, people spittin on me
Every time the earth shake is when you feeling me speak
I don't try to talk too much, but the feeling is deep
Things I see every day make me crack open
Dope dealers sold rock, say the crack open
I done watch em grow up claiming West Oakland
People building houses on my stomach
Not enough structures, so sometimes I vomit
Break the house slowly, not stable enough
Young thug killed his friend cause he jealous and dumb
I done watched him rape girls cause they hand him a gun
Blood splatter on my face now my face is numb
Yeah, now my face is numb

[Verse 2]
Police comin by with the tape and cameras
Lost too many men to the tape and cameras
You would think how many died it would set an example
But nobody even cared, just another example
Pourin liqour on my legs cause his partner is dead
Used to play with the white now it's liquor instead
One dude, named Dwight, had a car he drove on me
Every time he rolled up see his partners roll on him
I could tell that they didn't like that he was driving a Benz
Fake friends always hate when you driving to win
Dwight picked him up, wanted to give em a ride
Let em in the back seat, just so the feeling inside
He ain't tryna stunt on him, worked hard for his ride
Plus he wanted to show the leather and the heat in the side
They ain't understand the grind, they just seen his ride
So they shot him in the neck just for being inside
They was friends for 10 years but they greedy inside
Dwight fell out the car, he was bleedin, he died
They tried to switch the plates and the colour of the Benz
So they could stunt in front of hoes, show em money that they spent
They drove to the East for an even exchange
When the cops pulled up, it wasn't even exchanged
Pull em out the stolen car with the murderous weapon
Said you finnah go to jail with a murderous blessing
Every day is something, the weather doesn't help it
The heat make em pop off shots like B. Celtics
Bossin, every hood, always see the flossin
Seen the coke bosses, credit card bosses
Being in the hood I done traveled to the Slauson
Being on the turf I done seen em kill for colors
Watchin baby mothers without baby fathers
The kids are my soul, they walking on my fortress
Sitting on they porches, looking at surroudings
Never coming down, but the sun is coming down
And Gunshots wake when the last sun sleeps
I ain't never cried last time it was a hailstorm
Maybe it's an earthquake, better yet a snowstorm
If you get mad, everything that you know umm...
Only in the hood, nobody ever watch it
No money in it, so it's negative in profit
I need construction workers, only my doctors
City council gave me a couple more options
If I keep cracking they was gonna fix me
I speak for the block the rest of it was history
Lil Boss

[Outro]
Yeah, Know what I mean, man?
This Lil B for Lil Boss
All I could say man is:
I feel like I'm the hood man, y'nawmean?
It's a scene
I feel like I'm the ground, everything in it, you feel me?
Just watching so many things, seeing so many things, so many things go down here, man
Nawmean?
But it's like a picture, man
Abstract art or something
Ya feel me?
Just look at it from the directors point of view
There's something I can show you
You show us too
This is real based
