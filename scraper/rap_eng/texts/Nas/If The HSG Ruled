Ayo, if I ruled the world, on the first day, shit
I'd give a speech and my first statement
I'd say I won't rest til we find a kit that cures AIDS first
I'd call it a first aid kit
Every hurt patient would be top priority
Laws would be based on what's not right morally
Ever race would get to know each other
Black and white would roll together in a circle like a soccer ball
Kick it with each other, no set trippin' on your brother
No cops involved or Rob Duvall arrestin' niggas over colors
Sounds like utopia, you say this world is fine? Sounds like you told me a lie
I wanna rule like Jeffrey Atkins, so blacks can have more than 1 liter like a gallon
I could just imagine, but yo Nas, if you ruled the world what would happen
I'm just askin'

[Nas]
The way to be, paradise like relaxing black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani exchange the reins
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, click rollin
Tricking 6 digits on kicks and still holdin
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet'd go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa

[Kenny]
I hope for fairy tales and Phantoms but end up on back of bus
Wild child, I'm from where the heaters go pow pow
I'd retrieve weapons from streets, no one would get a Glock
Save our city, no more hurt screams and feelings
We wouldn't have a government who covers shit
We would just all make a covenant and fight what we up against
School systems would teach more actual facts
Most of us lead lives that don't relate to half of that crap
I'd ban certain foods, health problems kill us consistently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
I'd change the requirements for running for president
Won't hide cures of diseases to get money for medicine
Evil'll stop, I make it easier for us to reach a piece of the pie, it'll be illegal to lie
And people would give a fuck when other countries show hunger
If I ruled the world then money would no longer

[Outro: Lauryn Hill (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could
Be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world (Still living for today, in
These last days and times)
