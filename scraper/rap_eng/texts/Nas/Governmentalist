[Verse 1: Joss Stone]
(Don't you dare)
Interrupt the White House ball
(We're living scared)
It's in foreign fields the soldiers fall

Ooh, ooh, ooh, la, la, la
Snatch 'em in their prime
Go ahead that's fine, that's fine

Just go drill for grease, yeah
Like a diamond thief, yeah, yeah
Their mamas will be alright
Just give 'em time
Go get your money right
You won't lose no sleep tonight

Nominate your kids I think they'd prove your theory right
Would you watch them die?

[Hook: Joss Stone]
Like tryna get a hold of smoke and water
Coming up with nothing every time
How come we ain't getting any closer
Tryna find the truth behind the lies?

[Verse 2: Joss Stone]
(Look up, look up)
See a dead man walking
(See his baby face)
Hey, let's duplicate a few
Ooh, ooh, ooh, la, la, la
That don't mean much to you

(If you need some help)
Send some hippies in to help
You think more than you do
Hows about another line or two
To pick you up, pick you up
While your people drown, drown

I hope you're happy
And you sleep so great at night
While the lovers cry

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joss Stone]
How many lives will you sacrifice?
Will you ever be satisfied?
If in God you trust, can't you hear him still?
I ain't no preacher but thou shalt not kill

[Nas]
Yo, check it
I'm praisin' the states and the streets I'm raised in
Pain is the perfume scent I'm sprayed in
It clash with the federal agents fragrance
I smell a pig, that's a cop who's racist
I'm an ordinary project dude
I'm subject to genetically modified fool
That's FDA approved, mass produced
So you can tell a lie from the truth
Even though I'm fly in my tie and force suit
Le jet like a Concorde, swoop through the air
Then I land in my van, I'm cool
And I still stand with the Uganda youths
All the poor kids out in Moscow that live hostile
I ride for you when I ride with the top down
Listenin' to Joss' sounds, you see how that feel
I see these come with government seals
Open it, peek Nas getting' at his enemies
And the paragraphs are for similes
Governmentalists killed the Kennedy's
I heard that Joss Stone got the remedies

[Joss Stone]
Governmental, confusion
Governmentalist, it's delusion
Governmental, confusion
A bunch of governmentalist, it's delusion

[Hook]
Tryna get a hold of smoke and water
Coming up with nothing every time
How come we ain't getting any closer
Tryna find the truth behind the lies?

[Verse 4: Joss Stone]
And all that we're left with
Is a hand full of nothing
A hand full of nothing
That's all that I got
Hand full of nothing

Governmental, confusion
Just some governmentalist, delusion
Governmental, confusion, yeah
Governmentalist, it's delusion
Yeah, yeah
