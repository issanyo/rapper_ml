[Intro]
Aiyyo whattup niggas?
Fresh off the honeymoon
The honeymoon's over
Fresh off vaca' (Yeah, yeah)
I'm jet-laggin', still jet-laggin'
But this just a preview
Let's get it on again y'all

[Verse]
I designed it, rhymed it, flow classic
You askin' who am signed with?
The real deal's Ill Will, stay scomit
Why's drama when other artists pay homage
You hatin any rapper I do a song with
"What's wrong with Nas helpin' crews get stronger"
You selfish, wantin' me to yourself
But prophets need help too, y'all see Nas get insulted
I ride for the real shit, High as the Lock's get melted
Twelve Years, givin' you nuttin' but big moments
How can Murda Inc not wanna fuck wit
The top hustler - R.O.C. crusha
Nas a legend 'fore BIG & Pac left us
Bubbled wit Dr. Drizze, you heard it on Makaveli
Sayin': "Nas is ring leader, brings Ether, brings heater"
Your dream teamer scream, "He's the Supreme Teacher"
Similar to anybody you know
Oh, I created, cremated, bodied that flow
Anyone you think is fuckin' wit me
Better be vets, better be Ra, better be Kool G, or KRS
Better be LL, or Slick or them
Neva put me in the Top Ten, bitch!
It's disrespect to the life that burnt the verses
Or nigga writes who comes first
It's the Ice Cube, MC Shan, them type dudes
So BET's list was wrong, don't get me wrong
I did chill in the throne alone so long
This is my My Will

[Outro]
Yeah, Escobaro Cigars, that's how we doin' it
Ayyo Quan, welcome to the game!
Shot-out to Ill Will (This is my my will)
Bravehearts stand up! Whuttup Scarface?
Whuttup Tre Williams? (This is my will)
Ill Will '05, what y'all know 'bout that?
Queens, Queens I know you miss me
I gotchu, I gotchu Queens, New York stand up!
Aha, I gotchu baby, let's do it again!
