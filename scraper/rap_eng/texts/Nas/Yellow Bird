[Hook]
Yellow bird, yellow bird, yellow bird don't fly away x2
Not today

[Verse 1]
I'm in the game
Women only want my money or fame
Or they heard that Kendrick put them on blast
Or they feel I had so much ass
"What could he want from me? When he can have whoever he wants for company?"
The like, "he a slut, he a ho, he a freak
He my childhood crush, wish I met him '03
Now I need a simple life with a Christian man"
I was like, fuck it, get this money, get this power, keep slutting
Then I bumped into a cutie, looking at her
Not in a lusted matter, but in we need an introduction matter
Need her like fresh water from the springs of Florida
She hot for reasons more than one
Underneath the balling sun in Coachella where a I met her
She was staring
Since we began to hang, she my number one thing
Tell me your troubles, I'll listen, I'll try to numb your pain
You like to hug a king, I call you the color queen

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oh burn me love, it's not a drug nor complexion necessarily
It's an expression the canary sings
If that canary don't sing, I train her
On the wings of love, I took the top from the Wrangler
She riding shotgun with her shades on, a day will come
I'll put a natural yellow rock on your finger
Born a queen, love looking at you, smile made me change up
You a bright sunny morning, sex, amazing
I said it since day one, we was meant to be
When you put my clothes on and started posing like a G
Playfully with my chain then you liked what you see
Loving how daddy do it, no one quite like me
No games, no side chicks, me and my ride or die chick
We see eye to eye, maybe not when your heels are five inch
You so fly, you so mine, it's me you dine with
Fucking Nas with, later on we spawn
