[Jermaine Dupri]
Ya'll know where we takin this huh
JE ya'll, Nas
So, So, Def

[Nas]
I'm nasty
Never let a pretty face pass me
C'mon ya'll knowin it's easy
For me to get a good girl, turn her out to sleesy and trashy
She's freaky, live in the bed
Make baby girl eyes roll in her head
This what you need, my mission is to please, hands to the sky
Nas, JE

[JE]
Now your girl said you, was out lookin for me
If so then you, need to come and see
If you ready for a night that you won't never forget
I'll give you pleasure and real love, If you let me in
Baby tell me what it is you want from me
Don't beat around the bush, if you want my body

[Hook] [JE]
If you can want it, girl I got it, got it
Come and get with me
Girl I turn your body inside out, and bring exctasy
If you want it, baby come and bring your body to me
If you need it, girl I got it, got it, got, got, got, got it c'mon

[JE]
If you want me girl, you need to come with me
I've searched all aroudn the world, finding you is like a dream
When we wake up, you won't feel the same about me
Cause you'll realize, your life won't be the same without me
Baby tell me what it is you want from me
Don't beat around the bush, if you want my body

[Hook] [JE]
If you can want it, girl I got it, got it
Come and get with me
Girl I turn your body inside out, and bring exctasy
If you want it, baby come and bring your body to me
If you need it, girl I got it, got it, got, got, got, got it c'mon

[Bridge][JE]
Jus you, and me
Baby just bring your body, to me
Tell everybody, about me
Baby just move your body, around me, me, me

[Nas]
Girl what's your astrology?
Virgo? If so, you the same sign as me
Gemini's are fly, the kind I need
Love Aquarius, and Pisces
Can't leave a Libra, I live life day to day, let a playa play
Supporting my women, all my Capricorns and Scorpio women
Leos and Cancer, girl's be bad
Only sign I can't deal with is Sadge
Confusin my enemies, never losin
Clever movement, act smooth where the women be, amused by my energy
When they choose me, I just tell them the music's my remedy
I just swell em, and leave em swollen
Girl this is something that you need to know

[Hook]x2 [JE]
If you can want it, girl I got it, got it
Come and get with me
Girl I turn your body inside out, and bring exctasy
If you want it, baby come and bring your body to me
If you need it, girl I got it, got it, got, got, got, got it c'mon
