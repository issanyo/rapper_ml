[Verse 1]
We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do some, do some

[Hook]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it

[Verse 2: Nas]
Met Gala
42, but I fuck 'em like I'm 22
Backing and hanging that's all I do
I've been through aunties and mamas
Now its they daughters turn
I done ran through money but I got more to burn
Windows tinted, indo in it
I got that je ne sais quoi, a glass of Henny then muah
Here some freestyle, kiss them other lips wow
Bedroom bruises like we did Jiu-Jitsu
That official dick down
Spiritual chakras, frequency
I'm her holistic doctor, treatments frequently
Put her on a elevator to a higher self
Like Monte Carlo to acquire wealth
New dough I'm getting, the biggest my man hit me said 'let me hold something before them hoes get it'
OG flow, tailored clothes
The type to wear tuxedos with 40 belows
Can drop a BB out a spray-can
Driving down Cullens, Nas be wildin'
Rich nigga problems
I've been pimpin' since Big Pimpin', been pimpin'
Jazzy Jeff hoes out the door, Fresh Prince shit
Go tell a friend , bitch!

[Hook]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill
