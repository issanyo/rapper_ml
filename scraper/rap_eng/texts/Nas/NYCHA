[Verse 1: Dave East]
We living life like we stars
Constantly medical come right out them jars
Deserve a medal for surviving these scars
I'm ducking trifling broads
The gun store ain't seen a rifle this large
Computer thugs you niggas typing too hard
We backspace and delete a nigga
Them A list parties I never see them niggas
That weed and liquor blurry your vision
You'll never see the picture
Don't be defensive, L told me nigga just be consistent
From Little Caesar's splitting
Niggas change you see 'em different
Aim for the top though
First class plane to Morocco
The change came I ain't change
I might cop a Picasso
I'm after bags I'm eating crabs on blocks they will not go
These niggas sad
And you can smell it on me I am not broke
Roll up the nitro, only copping coke when the price low
In the Maybach told the driver follow where Artie Bike go
Learn survival before you meet your idols as far as I know
This pistol my insurance ain't no need for calling Geico

[Chorus: Dave East]
Take you to kitchens where they actually cook
Nobody knew you then you had to get booked
Shoot at the car, hit the driver
Now the passenger shook
This pack just came in from Cali
I ain't passing this kush
Remember sitting in the court like damn I'm back in these cuffs
From having arguments with smokers I ain't have enough dust
Early morning 50 baggies hit the Ave in a rush
We tryna get it might do credit
Just don't ask for too much
Hundreds we touch

[Verse 2: Nas]
New York City housing authority honor me
Property of the ghetto
Choppers popping
I should receive a medal for surviving
If you snooze, sleep with your snub nose
I did receive a medal from Harvard and rose above those
Obstacle courses where cops and shots'll stop you from reaching your full potential
You dreaming, life'll pinch you
This with no sheet of paper
No pen or pencil, straight off the mental
Off the fly
Often they falsify what they been through
I'm on that old flyness
Sliding in Benzes
Minding my business
My time is expensive
My dogs locked down they surviving through pictures
We wish we could break the bars, the law's extensive
My mind gotta be twisted
You dealing with sickos, psychos
Po-9, 12, Teflon vest for your chest in this hell
He wearing beads on his neck to cast away the spells
And tattoos of his loved ones that they resting well

[Chorus: Dave East]
I could take you to kitchens where they actually cook
Nobody knew you then you had to get booked
Shoot at the car, hit the driver
Now the passenger shook
This pack just came in from Cali
I ain't passing this kush
Remember sitting in the court like damn I'm back in these cuffs
From having arguments with smokers I ain't have enough dust
Early morning 50 baggies hit the Ave in a rush
We tryna get it might do credit
Just don't ask for too much
Hundreds we touch

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I been rushing lately, the jungle crazy
On 10th Street leaning heavy, I pass the gun to shady
My shorty want me
Twin 40's on me, I'm touching 80
Ten thousand cash on me daily, I must be fucking crazy
The ladies love me lately
Butter Mercedes, parkay with a touch of gravy
That's brown seats
The motto is still fuck you, just pay me
My neighbor addicted to water, he stuck in the Navy
Same block where you could lose your life
I be comfortable baby
My bitch is way badder than yours, tell me why would I stare
Never dying my hair
I wake up, get high as a Lear
You looking at me too long, niggas die for a stare
Drano said he like them Giuseppe's, I'ma buy him a pair
I'ma run my city to the point I get high with the mayor
This ain't Roc-A-Fella
But we forming a Dynasty here
Triangle, smoke choke 'em, I watch them guys strangle
Lost five of my closest
Now I know I got five angels

[Chorus: Dave East]
I could take you to kitchens where they actually cook
Nobody knew you then you had to get booked
Shoot at the car, hit the driver
Now the passenger shook
This pack just came in from Cali
I ain't passing this kush
Remember sitting in the court like damn I'm back in these cuffs
From having arguments with smokers I ain't have enough dust
Early morning 50 baggies hit the Ave in a rush
We tryna get it might do credit
Just don't ask for too much
Hundreds we touch

[Outro: Dave East]
Hundreds we touch, I could, I could
Hundreds we touch
I might do credit, might do credit...
Just don't ask for too much
Hundreds we touch
I might do credit, might do credit...
Hundreds we touch
Hundreds we touch
Gotta be a real nigga to feel a real nigga
All you weirdos, huh, you'll never get it
Eastside, border, Dirt Gang, (?)...
