[Verse 1: Nas]
I, splash y'all dudes with gats I use
Ice dangle off my chest 'cause my cash improve
Nice knuckle game, chip-toothed, weigh a buck and change
I want the dough, fuck the fame
Already made history, y'all can have that, that ain't shit to me
About to have my own ASCAP, and NASDAQ
And plus a rotisserie, instead of Kenny Rogers
And Benihana's, y'all can eat, plenty at Nas'
Buffet of lobsters, dressed in Esco' boxers
For honies that sex so proper, best flow since Rakim
Liver, personification of drama
Describe my, characteristics, murder co-signer
Some'll smoke embalmin' fluid and vomit to it
I'm straight chronic, yo it's atomic how I blew up
Same ol' G, since I rocked Kangol's, Lee's
Nothin' changed but my bankroll, still jig to the ankles

[Chorus: Nas]
Please, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my gangstas
To my riders, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my niggas
To my riders, to my gangstas
To my bitches, to my niggas
And fly ass hoes, to my niggas
To my bitches, Timbaland and Esco'

[Verse 2: Mad Skillz]
Yo, yo, we rippin' tracks, it's like beatin' beats with bats
Watchin' crews change the views when the heat in they back
If you hear a click, trust me, you will hear a clack
If you push it up front, I got no choice, but to pull it back
Your rhymes don't faze me, I'm above 'em; half y'all raps is
Born retarded, now you out here tryin to get rid of it
You should be sick of it, I possess no flaws
That's from the man that made your Head Nod 'til you licked his balls
Verses I spit 'em, when it's my turn to get 'em, I got hot flows
I only do shows for burn victims
So cock this mic, and bust out your back, kill you
And then they gonna blame me for fuckin' up rap
Who's fuckin' with that? Skillz and Esco', it's on
When you speak in my direction, watch your tone
From Q-B to V-A, can't count the blocks we own
It's locked and sewn I repeat, nigga, watch your tone

[Chorus: Nas]
Please, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my gangstas
To my riders, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my niggas
To my riders, to my gangstas
To my bitches, to my niggas
And fly ass hoes, to my niggas
To my bitches, Timbaland and Esco'

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
Yo commmmmme see
The big man with the diamonds and the fly Bentleys
Ladies loooooovve me; niggas say
"Timbaland's really rappin', what the fuck is up, B?"
The jeallllllousy
I kill niggas with seven thangs, mostly they jackin' beats
I'm a eight digit niiggy
Baby, I just rebuilt Titanic and send it out to sea
What?

[Chorus: Nas]
Please, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my gangstas
To my riders, to my niggas
To my bitches, to my niggas
To my riders, to my gangstas
To my bitches, to my niggas
And fly ass hoes, to my niggas
To my bitches, Timbaland and Esco'
