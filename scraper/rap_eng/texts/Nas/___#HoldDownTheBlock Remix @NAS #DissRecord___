Verse 1

Now why these niggas ain't wonna quit rapping over pac
Thought they survived to the beef with subliminal shots I’m gunning through bloc*’s
Making niggas vision you pac, he boosted yo flow, but ain't a nigga jacking a pattern loco didn’t notice
Unload the choppa at his focus with explosions of retaliation no anticipation Fake and Bake Generation prior to me
Make a classic mirror bull shit and after me a diamond in the desert sun its nothing when you hit me
Rip throughout any block nuts and brains it's nothing matching me, Rap Game Grim Reaper even your majesties a casualty
As I pluck niggas off gradually, toe tag em mathematically grammatically I tragically hunt dreams With quotes brainyactically
And that word don’t even exists, but Webster won't contact me
I got scripts of gigabytes, loaded lyrical genocide, forget to hide, your pride’s the reason that ass fried
With bars I generated from a thunder bolt in a tornado cloud, definition of pop from my type of static
Back in 03 I was shooting the 805 hip hop show with D Tragic, months prior almost a victim of something tragic
Just imagine if I was riding with automatic, Flow galactic, clap shit practical demonstration
Dead end ya path, whiteness the wrath perfect orchestration, lyrically birth it, when niggas like you quoted it was dead
Clouding the lane for spitters with the gift to earn this bread, Losing your brain Nas catalog state of emergency
#HostileAndHungry6 Im knocking snitches bitches geez deliriously motivate your history by the next mix track
Damage your necks spitting raps on beats through tracks, i spit heat heat loose gas line open to a spark
Lift you from dre beats musically like you the homie just ass jay-z i kick ass swazis pulp fiction samuel team
When painting pictues mean, Supreme beat ass g string When dollars bills on the flow, leaving your status crispy cream
You sweet and out of style, I catch the fade just call big snoop, meet you at the spot matching the shit from all my shoots
Your recruits been deeded they coupes been fleaded, the troops was spreaded i nuke ten legends through 8 records
From downtown Oxnard across the world, You herd me right I got the block

Outro:
An I didn’t even find the beat that I was looking for right now, #LMMFBAO and I just lyrically knocked nas tooth back to normal, when music is what mattered to him
