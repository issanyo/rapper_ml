[Intro]
You know they gon’ say
What Diggy know bout '88?
Well I know this much
They made a lotta money back then
And that’s what mine lookin’ like

[Verse 1: Diggy]
Aye lil' nigga, it’s Diggy, got the key to the city
Check my family tree, you know uncle taught Diddy
Who turned around and taught Biggie and Biggie taught Jigga
So you can just imagine what he teaching me, nigga
My top down in the winter, my doors up in the summer
I pulled up to the light and I drove off with her number
88 is the number, like Michael Irvin but younger
Ain’t no preserving my hunger, no, they like, "Where did he come from?"
Well I got 2 years in and a couple of months
Yeah, the road was Bobby Brown, it had a couple of bumps
They be showing me love, minus a couple of chumps
In my best Chris Tucker voice, “Is this watchu want?!”

[Hook]
No need to front, homie pardon my back
I’m gettin it crazy, how retarded is that?
I’m playin’ my cards, got a fistful of ace’s
And these lil faces I’m spending, you prolly could trace it
To 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)
88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)

[Verse 2: Diggy]
I hear the hate, I don’t sweat it cause I’m getting that fetti’ (I said it)
I see a lot of mad rappers, Derric "D-Dot" Angelettie
Compliments to the chef, ya boy out here eatin great
Homie, you ain't no umpire, why you watchin my plate?
While you watchin my pockets, Jordan 3′s in my closet
I get it all sent to me so I don’t need to go to shopping
I ain’t braggin, I’m swagging, my fly ladies whats happening?
Shout to Nicki I’m an Aries and we go good with Sag’s
... Mm-hm
Hope that made you smirk, I’m a flirt like Kirk
With Dirty Money God made dirt and (uh) dirt don’t hurt
This for my niggas that’s getting it every month on the first

[Hook]
No need to front, homie pardon my back
I’m gettin it crazy, how retarded is that?
I’m playin’ my cards, got a fistful of ace’s
And these lil faces I’m spending, you prolly could trace it
To 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)
88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo, that’s what my family was rockin’, I just sat back and watched em
I was only 13 so I ain’t know nothin bout coppin’
I just knew that they had it and if I asked then I got it
It all started from trees then it turned to narcotics
All the whips was exotic, all the chicks was erotic
Money was coming so fast, all you needed was product
And somebody to test it, find a good place to try it
Never keep nothin’ on you, find a good place to hide it
If I’m in it I own it cause if I like it I buy it
Keep the loud in the air, connect like that I’m quiet
How’d you hop in this platinum and you ain’t even near gold?
Cause I’m still spendin’ money that’s 24 years old!

[Outro]
To 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88!)
88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88, 88
(And I’m still spending money from 88!)
