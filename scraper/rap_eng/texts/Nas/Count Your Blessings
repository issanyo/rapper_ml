[Hook 1: JR GONG]
And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising
I count my blessings

That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
Not by force
I'm suggesting
You count your blessings

I've got love and assurance
I've got new heath insurance
I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
Better count your blessings

[Verse 1: Nas]
'Cause yo this year, can't wait till he gets here
7/21/09 my first son will shine
And it's amazing, I'm about to be raising
Another made man and like his dad they'll praise him
And some will hate him just 'cause we're building a nation
Like Bob did with Damian, the world will embrace him
Girls will chase him, foresee they will not break him
And when I'm not around you look for God and thank him

[Hook 2 - JR GONG]
And I've got somewhere to dress for
And I've got no need to stress for
And so I'll always put my best forth
And count my blessings

And there'll be no need for tissues
Cause there'll be no further issues
If you've got someone who miss you
Man count your blessings

And I've got love and assurance
And I've got new heath insurance
And I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
Better count your blessings

[Verse 1: Nas]
You're wishing you were sitting in the top position
Picture perfect, nothing less 'cause you deserve it
Without the Hermes, you never hurting
You knew that you was destined for greatness for certain
But see the over zealous, they be thirsting, caught up in emotion
You're keeping your composure like Gershwin
Songs by Earth, Wind, keep you in a zone writing verses
So when your pocket's light, know that you have a heavy purpose

[Hook 3 - JR GONG]
We've got pre-school and day care
We've got pension and well-fare
And though not all will play the game fair
Still I count my blessings

I've got joy in abundance
I've got life full of substance
I've got meetings and functions
So I count my blessings

I've got something to live for
I've got surplus to give more
And we're all welcome through his door
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
So I count your blessings

[VERSE 3 - NAS]
I think you're looking too hard for it
Want the double R
Under your garage door
Appreciate the things you work hard for
And count your blessing
Count your blessings
So don't be mad if you ain't fly y'all
You got the means
To reach the level I'm on
You should know that there's only one Nas
Y'all
But count your blessing
Count your blessing
Ra!

[Hook 4 - JR GONG]
And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new son is rising
I count my blessings

That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
Not by force
I'm suggesting
You count your blessings

I've got love and assurance
I've got new heath insurance
I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
Better count your blessings
