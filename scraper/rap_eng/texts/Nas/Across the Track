[Intro:R&B Sample] (Nas)
I'm from the other side of town (For real) out of bounds
To anybody, who don't live around
I never learned to share or, how to care (Light somethin up)
I never had no teachings, about being fair

[Verse 1: Nas ]
Yo! Thank God for the Rolls symbol on my hood
Silver lady with the wind she pop up pretty wood interior
I stay a good nigga, don't speak on facts unless you correct you losin respect
Ferrari floors are clean, draws are clean, what!
Verses, all my bars are mean
Lil' money, lil' risk, lil' faith, lil' guidance
It ain't rocket science your prophet try to be honest
Paul Wall deemed, IWC watches
But I ain't walk around with no poodle under my armpit
Actin all she she, cause I ain't got it easy
I been through it, slim through R never PG

[Hook]:
You across the track, completely relaxed
You take a warning back, don't you never come back
You across the track, completly relaxed
You take a warning back, don't you never come back

[Verse 2: Papoose]
Don't you ever try to stop the uprisin of a Kingdom
I got enough bars to take away your fuckin freedom
My arms long enough to box the devil I could beat him
If his arms long enough to box God I'm a weave him
He wanna learn he's starvin for knowledge I'm a feed 'em
But if he wise I'm hungry for for knowledge I'm a heat 'em
If you was manifestin all them lessons that you readin
You would even believe in the teachings that you preachin
Heathens sneak even left leakin in the beacon
The gangs peeped him they In Living Color like Keenen
And hell I ain't talkin about breathin
Stupid why you reachin my hand stay on the pound like Lincoln
I'm powerful you weaklin, the firin pen went to the spring
Summer, fall like the seasons in your region
Papoose and Nas is a legion
Everything happens for a reason, have a good evenin

[Hook]:
You across the track, completly relaxed
You take a warning back, don't you never come back
You across the track, completly relaxed
You take a warning back, don't you never come back
