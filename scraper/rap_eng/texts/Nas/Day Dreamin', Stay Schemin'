[Intro]
To my niggas
To my niggas
What! What!

[Verse 1]
Looking back in time, when I had on my shine
I saw you standing there
I never tried to diss you, you didn't need your pistol
Why did you have to take it there
But then again, it was just my imagination
When my crew told me it was you that was player hating
Then we had to have that terrible confrontation
There's nothing I can do to help this situation...

[Hook]
Stay scheming (ya niggas kill me)
Niggas wanna get at me
Stay scheming
Niggas wanna get at me

[Verse 2]
Its been awhile since the last time we hung out
Full of weed, drinking henny until we all passed out
Stretch bently, Queens clique, pushing mean whips
And ho I'm with, glad who see she with
Shorty with the don
Me and horse switch cars
Jazz ruff for the six, this is it par
Thug nigga never thought I get this far
Who is that icing me from over there in the fog?
You got the mack god, you got the gat par
Dam, why they gotta do it to the black god
Everytime we chilling niggas want to act hard
My nigga Jungle known to slap a nigga back-ward
So we chill pay no mind, think about about shit
I'm for the love of it
Stubborn niggas always plotting on the brother tip
Can't even chill cause niggas just

[Hook]
Stay scheming
Niggas wanna get at me
Stay scheming
Niggas wanna kidnap me

[Outro]
But they never do it motherfuckers...
