[Nas] (Jon B)
(oohh, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oh oh)
2000, Jon B y'all, N-A-S y'all
To the death y'all (ay baby)
Come on, get it right

Look at them brown nosin'
My click pullin up with purple roses
Purple diamonds, pinky rings, purple douja
Heaven had to mold'er, look at the earth she bangin
Gucci purse, wonderin what ghetto that she came from
She gangstah, from her head to her feet
By birth I'm a soldier, bet the pearl come sweet
And I felt the world wet when we met
She felt like, somethin i'd never forget
Somethin you had to witness, perfect physical fitness
Alerted all my five senses, I said my name is Nas love
And whos the girl next to ya, this my man boogotti
I'd like to introduce ya

[Jon B] (Nas)
Well if I wasn't alive
Somethin we feel just might be real if we try, if we try baby
I know I'm giving you love, but is it really enough for you to be satisfied?
Whoa, yeah. you always know that you're beautiful
Do you see the beauty that I see inside, (do you see it baby) inside you
Somethin I wanna do, is travel the world to find the girl for sure was you
(all around the world, til' I found you baby girl)
Where can I show you the finer things, the finer things in life
The finer things in life baby, all for you
Mami just you and i, hit you with some love tonight
Hit you with some love tonight, hit you with some love tonight
But if I want some your life, everything you want to feel is real in my mind
Got your own mind, like making love to you right
Your body's telling everything I need to do it tonight, oh no, whoa
Baby, they said that you could stay a long time
Please say that you could spend another night, with me
What up with the house on the beach?
You gonna sip a little apple martini
I want you to just lay back and let me freak (uh uh, how it feel baby)
Your insecurities

[Nas] (Jon B)
If I was ya man, your knowledge would expand til we both the equal
Chillin on islands where the sand and the ocean is deep blue
Theres three things that I got on my list
You qualify, you my miss, I count em down like this
Number one, you gotta be real (yeah babe), dont lie to me about managomy (yeah babe)
See hun' get out of my grill, love me, if I'm locked up or I'm out on appeal (feel me babe)
Keep it tight when I'm in it (ooh yeah), ask me how does it feel
Number two, easy to do, be who you are
Be with me a real G (you got, yoou got), with every beat of your heart
And number three, last but not least
Give me peace, and I'll show you the world most girls ain't lucky to see
Jon B!

[Jon B] (Nas)
