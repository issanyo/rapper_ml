Thanks:
Thank God, the spirits and guardian angels, ancestors, fallen soldiers, grandparents, life and death. To every ghetto, from Queensbridge, to Kingston, to Africa. Thanks to all the real rap niggas and lovers of God's music from the streets. To Destiny (my life) and Mom (my strength). Shout outs to everyone... keep smilin', life is pain... get over it. Be happy, fuck negativity. We kings and queens of the universe, makers and molders, gods and goddesses. Don't take anybody shit! Get smart, get started, get money and get high. The time is now! Peace blessing and miracles. Be a leader. Make love and history. Learn from foul, lost people! You are everything

To Ill Will 4 watchin' my back and guidin' me. Can't wait to see you dawg. Don't worry, I got u!
