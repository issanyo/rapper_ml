[Intro: AZ]
Yea, yea, check it out
I see today's mathematics as being understanding, you know?
Understanding is having the ability to see things clearly
For what they are not what they present theyself to be
It completes the cipher, you know what I'm saying?
It's also symbolic to the black child which is the best part
Ayo, son, represent

[Verse 1: Nas]
Now I'm the average nigga in the street life God
I try to beat trife odds, ride my elite through the night fog and park
It's Buddha to be sparked, it's consistent
The beast smells the el because it travels long distance
Cruising in his Chrysler, pursuing niggas in my cipher
Start wildin' like insane asylum on Rikers Island
Verbal assassin, I murder freestylin'
One two for the gun crew, three drinking Cristal n
I play the side cause the words of man kill
Proverbs, buck out my grill, real as Ill Will, keep still
Nobody move nobody die, why must I be high?
Busting in trife bitches, touchin' mic switches
It's like a hot spoon of heroin, a Don like Perignon
Females love the guns I be wearing
Plant my seeds to live infinite, indeed in my sentences
I flow demandin', that's understandin'

[Verse 2: Nas]
850 Tempo but rugged like a Pinto
Chop shop hip-hop, burn the block intro
High priests release voodoo, déjà vu and this taboo
Illmatic shit and what have you
Chef cocaine cook, no brain got the proper diction
My competition bleeds words and weed blurs my vision
I'm freezing in time, stop the rhyme
I'm sober in stolen Range Rover much crime
I, stick up America, Nas in your area
Disrupt the sound barrier, clowns get pounds of terror
A full whip for more clips then Clint has in his era
Dirty Harry, cold black the uncanny, of Kojak
A Beretta sticking up trucks carrying amaretto
Clever to entice 'em, herbs I'm micin' while I'm pricin'
Niggas like they're slaves, best behave I'm the nice one
Nas, broken down for Nasir, means protection
Pop Dukes, resurrection international hoes, I'm sexin'
Or you'll be fucking one section, question?
Does a lonely mic give me an erection?, yes, son
On a float like the Jetsons futuristic rappin' mystic
Bust it, try and diss while my finger is on the iron biscuit
I rhyme terrific sparklin' like the diamond district
It's understanding
