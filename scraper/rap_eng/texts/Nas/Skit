As long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son, your beef is mines

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ay yo, my thug related style attracts millions
Fans understand the plan, who’s the kid up in the green Land?
Then I skate motivate gettin' (Sniff)
Lifted, me and my chick get eight
Now im coolin' with the clique Mobb Deep and
Nas, word up here's the first prize I generate
Off the head piece, freestyle session word up son


[Verse 2: Nas]
Check it out yo
To my seed, may I lead you into no greed or evil
In the categories of stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, monkey do shorty sipping sunny dew
On a low like a [????], chill shades of flow
Big Havoc at like you know, kid

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Kid, you don't know me, you don't wanna know me
You tried to blow me your weak side just showed me
Stepped out my door on 41st Side at twelve
Didn't see my crew around so I got bent for search
I had to jet back upstairs so I can stash my nine
It was a Friday night Rikers had it bad one time
Cause niggas getting bagged on a regular son
D's like "Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns,"
So I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking
Niggas be ass talking then be victims of extortion
Hold myself down the only way I know
Niggas pumping back in streets, in debt cause they owe
Street life is like a trial, ass out if you blow
The maximum is death son you know how that go

[Interviewer]
The Infamous is in the house! We’d like to thank Mobb Deep for coming out, Queens is in the house! Remember that, Queens is in the house...
