[Hook]
War is necessary, war brings pain
But war is necessary, war brings peace
‘Cause war is necessary, get your warriors up
‘Cause my niggas are war ready
War brings hate (Esco,  let's go let's go let's go!)
War is necessary, war brings pain (Esco, let's go!)
Get your warriors up
‘Cause my niggas are war ready
My niggas war ready

[Verse 1]
Staring at the face of my watch, its like a crystal ball
With the ability to make the issue stall
I told my man duck, ‘cause I know where the missile fall
‘Cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich or small
Went to my man's crib who dead and saw his picture fall
I picked it up, his voice whispered, "Nigga, ball!"
So I smoke the finest, (85 for the ocean liners?)
I do it for the have-not's, I'm at spot
That resembles screen savers on your lap tops
And niggas can't believe it like seeing that nigga Zab drop
I be in Cameroon, bandanas on silk Dior
Sip cream liqueur, green and blue FILA velour's suits
Boss smooth, the only thing I endorse duke
Stash houses, gamble, I don't sweat a lawsuit
All true in living God, we was here first
Parisian linen garb and cashmere shirts

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 2]
Whose crew was realist? Shot up the movie theaters?
Times Square '88, whose crew was in it?
(Photographed was?) sittin' on wood wicker chairs
40oz in the lap, givin' off wicked stares
Punch out kings, bustin' pistols in the air
Hangin' out a Cutlass Supreme window like "Bitch, come here"
Girls cussing back at us with the fattest asses
Like, "Who you calling bitch?! Little black bastards!"
We had to wave the flag, here come they baby dad
Drug dealers in the crazy Jag looking crazy mad
They all thought they was sparkle, fucking killer men
But we was all Black seeds as Fred Williamson
It was so simple, now I'm reflecting in this gold Enzo
Face it, my favorite trinket was that Teddy Riley guy bracelet
So now it's fly shit I'm draped in, customized shit I'm makin'

[Repeat Hook]
