Verse One:
What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations you know you got a son
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin, talkin about he acts too rough
Ge didn't listen he be riffing while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jone's beach, it's bugged
Plus little rob is selling drugs on the dime
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9's
At night time it's more trife than ever
Whattup with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say whassup to herb, ice and bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
One what? 'One Love'

Verse Two:
Dear born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurting something
Word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with an ox for the phone piece
Wiling on the island but now with el mara
Better chill 'cos them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next VI
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks plus sent your flicks
Your brother's buck wiling in four maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key
So stay civilized, time flies though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your mom's cries
It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but One Love

Verse Three:
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, etcetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend hitting Ls while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I needed time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets have me stressed something terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Belle Vue
Or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but shorty doo-wop
Rolling two phillies together, in the bridge we call them oowops
He said Nas, niggas could be busting off the roof
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing when i peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and started talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only the blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose
Left some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake shorty I'm out 'One Love'
