[Intro: NaS]
You are the next thing
You got something that people should see
Beca-
It’s important you go all the way with it so that you get it out there for people to see
The world is waiting for it
You know?
Don’t wait on the world
Just start and get busy
Go

[Verse]
Shotgun detergent, soapy bed piss
Shitless, late nights in a urban flirtinis
We spit fish
Take bites of the Sturgeon prawn dish
Beware bitch
Ain’t heard of yall, but y'all heard we was raw
We can’t miss
No kiss and tell, just blick 'em and bail
We bare gifts
Oral C. L. with Franklin
Moukarzel dances
Pussy boy antlers
Hop on the bull horn and shoot a bull-tusk up out your mask kid
Back in the concrete jungles and now just
We make ya heartbeat double with style son
Niggas with half-moon parts shoot up Eclipse's
Then throw they kufi on and go to Jumu'ah for lentils

[Chorus]
Purified water
Sanctified dope
High top Wally, make the ankle sock croak
Cold black skin
Chalk white teeth
Strobe light green
All the broads like shoot
Purified water
Sanctified dope
High top Wally, make the ankle sock croak
Cold black skin
Chalk white teeth
Strobe light green
All the broads like shoot
