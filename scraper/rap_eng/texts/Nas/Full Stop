Always sitting pretty with my legs closed
Know just how to get up out of limos
If I gotta walk, then I gotta mean walk
If you wanna talk politics let's talk
Go by the book, and stick to the plan
Never see me looking at another man
It's no fun when it's all correct
Don't know why I've got my mind in check

Forget what you've heard
About the good girl
That's not what I'm about
I'm about

I wanna drive too fast
I wanna play full blast
I wanna dance till I drop
I wanna rock, full stop
I wanna roll too high
I wanna ride or die
I wanna live life hard knock
I wanna rock, full stop

Always call when I'm running a little late
Got my money put away in an estate
Never complain of how I feel
Always down and keeping it real
Always listen to my friends good advice
Never once gambled and I never roll the dice
Always care about the do's and don'ts
Cause I didn't want to disappoint

Forget what you've heard
About the good girl
That's not what I'm about
I'm a...

I wanna drive too fast
I wanna play full blast
I wanna dance till I drop
I wanna rock, full stop
I wanna roll too high
I wanna ride or die
I wanna live life hard knock
I wanna rock, full stop

Nas:
I wanna drive at 105 in the Lex ride
And over-take haters who ride in the X5 
I wanna play music so loud - right
The whole crowd will hold their ears and go - oww
I wanna dance till I drop or docs tell me to stop
Or die to the sounds of rock and hip-hop
So many things to do, it's a myriad
I wanna do whatever I want, period

I wanna drive too fast (Too fast)
I wanna play full blast (Full blast)
I wanna dance till I drop
I wanna rock, full stop
I wanna roll too high (Too high)
I wanna ride or die
I wanna live life hard knock
I wanna rock, full stop (Stop)

I wanna drive too fast (Too fast)
I wanna play full blast
I wanna dance till I drop
I wanna rock, full stop (That's what I wanna do)
I wanna roll too high
I wanna ride or die (Or die)
I wanna live life hard knock
I wanna rock, full stop
