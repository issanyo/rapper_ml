[Intro - Nas]
Uhh yeah yeah yo
It goes Tick Tock this is for my niggas in the Bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wristwatch
Because niggas well live they shits pop
Hey hey
Tick Tock this is for my hoes make your hips rock
Light a L baby let the Crys' pop
Get your Tick Tock from this hip hop, anyday

[Verse 1 - Nas]
5'8" with double-X-L pen saggin' blunts draggin'
But never lived well, imagine, a felon on a two-way street
One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap
The other street opportunity the chance to live sweet
Think positive k-nowledgement k-cypher complete
So you can be an architect design appartments and shit
Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip
Soon as I'm on the set I'm never on a chick I play it cool
But still ain't pussy muscles get wet it's just the booze
Check my niggas, what's the gossip, what's the word
Puff some herb, all I see is niggas runnin', chin shots
All I heard, dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground
Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down
Now it's back to the same old shit, you know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit
In the jungle swingin' on vines, I saw the gat with the same old clip
Another nigga layin' the hit, bloodied up, scream that I'm dyin'
I be in Queens where the famous hood rats and ghetto stars are
Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah

[Hook - Nas]
Tick Tock this is for my niggas in the Bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wristwatch
Because niggas well live they shits popped
Hey hey
Tick Tock this is for my hoes make your hips rock
Light a L baby let the Crys' pop
Get your Tick Tock from this hip hop, anyday

[Verse 2 - Prodigy]
It's like this nigga
It's on, toilet up for me, roll that shit big
While I reveal the story of a wild street kid
Cock your seat back, relax, while I spit
The spittin' image of how I live
Well first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks
I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen
Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open
Gangsta, I soaked it all in, my first ammo was a one shot
Deuce deuce, had my pockets full of bullets I was real loose
Thug parties out in wave crash always got shot up
Thug parties out in Queensbridge always got shot up
No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic
Niggas aim on the fight, we cut yo melon
Drinkin' that old english red bull and blue bull
Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit fuck it we was broke
Little badass, my nigga Rap sat me down, like this
He said: P you gon' wind up dead
You and Hav' real good with that music shit
You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind of the street
And it stuck in the back of my head, though
I still did my little bit of menacin'
Every now and then bang-outs in broad daylight
Like these things really happen niggas get cut up
I put it in my rappin'
It's non fiction it's the real deal fiscale
It couldn't get more graphic I'm so trail
I said it's non fiction it's the real deal fiscale
City you havin' let me touch that ass
