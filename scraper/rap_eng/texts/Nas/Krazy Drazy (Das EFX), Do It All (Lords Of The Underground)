[Verse 1: Redhead Kingpin]
It's Kingpin plus two I'm on the guestlist fam
But if this dude ain't like thirty he don't know who I am
Boo boo my name, monetary gain is better than fame
But let's face it without the spotlight you thinkin Red is Eddie Kane
If I was drugs then I used to be a key
Now I'm a couple ounce, on the come up hustle me
Yeah, and hip hop man ain't no 401K
I got my MPC I'll see you one day

[Verse 2: Rob Base]

Still rippin shows, Rob Base let me get ill yo!
It's the O.G., (who?) R to the O-B
B to the A-S-E, reppin N.Y.C
I toured the country, since I dropped my first CD (what?)
"It Takes Two", remember me?
If you don't it's the one that hit you with the WHOO YEAH
Used to make it so hot, you couldn't breathe the air

[Verse 3: The Original Spinderella]
Ain't but too much for you to sweller
Hard body, fuckin wit a Coke bottle model
Auburn, full back and observe
While I BLAP BLAP to your nerves, uh! (OH!)

Anything y'all will do, Spin dunn done it
The baguettes, the Prada stilet's
On the turntables, call me Gillette

[Verse 4: Father MC]
Yo! First of all big up to Nas the killer rip spitter
The Q.B. hitter called this Far Rock nigga
Yeah I'm drippin heavy from my head to my feet
From the bars that I spit to my name on her cheeks
Catch me on the mixtape, Bentley with the Queen draped
Pilot on deck G5 when I gotta skate
Let you know when I'm out on the dough that shows I'm sellin them
My LP's drugs nigga be like runnin listen

[Hook: Nas]

(HEY! Hit me! Where are they nooooooow?)
(*Here they are , two thousand and seven they right here, yeah, they right here)

[Verse 5: Monie Love]
One baby drop two to the three
Is she out for the count UK mic deceased?
You never heard again from words not the least
I checked first set net worth mic relief
Remain calm more vowels spit battles
And associate the kid when they hustlin up the cattle
I don't care to give when they ride like a saddle
Hip Hop crowd well in doubt where are you now?

[Verse 6: Mike G. from The Jungle Brothers]
It's the Jungle Brothers +housin+ with that fiiiiiive thousand
Blowin up your project housin, Baby Bam Lee just bouncin
Make me wanna crack a 40 ounce and, and straight get LOUD and
Chase her blouse and, turn her out
Cause I know we rockin party it's all about
Aiyyo cool calm collected and my name is Mike G
And I'm reppin for Nas and my crew the J Beez!

[Verse 7: EST from 3XDope]
Eight bars, ten stars, fuck five mics!
I'm +The Source+ and the boss, show you what it's like
To play bad mitten at the top of your position
Wit a whole lotta niggas wouldn't play but it's written
I'm the first to murk, chea! Representin Philly boy
The same kid that spit this wrote ?Baby Gram?
Nicholas one son the +Greatest Man+ livin
True school be like e'ryday thanksgiving

[Verse 8: Positive K]
Pos. K! Uh, uh, still spits this summer
Came up like I hit the number, yeah y'all know me!
I'm not a stranger to y'all in the orgies
Squeeze ya dick up in ya in the ear as if ya for me
I'm more "primetime" than Maury
Plus I took ya to the "Bridge" like James Brown and Nas applaud me
My rhymes is suppository, it feels shit
Top {?} watch Nemo then they watch the stories

[Hook: Nas]

(*Yeah did you hear your favorite yet?)
(*I know some of y'all buggin out, did you hear the dudes y'all used to like? the crazyness?)

(*I got more!!! I got more!!!)

[Verse 9: Krazy Drazy from Das EFX]
Miggity +microphone check+, "Where Are they Now" Nas remix
Feel how real Hip Hop needs this
Wish B.I.G, Pun, and Pac could see this
Diggity Das-EFX piggity pioneers in this
Made his kids just reminded y'all
Throwback go back to the nineties y'all
Look it up, hook it up, get the catalog
We your favorite rappers, rappers, rappin dog

[Verse 10: Mr. Do It All from Lords Of The Underground]
Yeah I go Nas, Lord Do It All
Me and you got something in common through Marley Marl
Burst in the bricks, talked to buyin ?leather?
Golden aged flows, you sound undiscovered
I do this with a passion, spray-paint tag in
Hip Hop's alive, and I'm the breathing dragon
On the stage whylin, jumpin and laughin
It's Lords of the Underground and that's if you're askin!

[Verse 11: Chip Fu from The Fu-Schickens]
Yo! I strip the booth anytime my lips move
And it spews, my screws and they loose, I'm a move and it's proof
Now give me two minutes I'm still wicked and still kickin it
With skills built and hot {?} you can't step in my shoes YO!!
When I'm in the mood, when I'm in the booth and whenever when you
I spit phantom in a boost you better just prepare to make room!
Nas give me eight bars, eight stars Escobar
Yo we rule, and we still ain't got nothin to prove, yo!

[Verse 12: Dres from Black Sheep]
For the second I'm wreckin I got you double-checkin
For me to flash your big chain wheeler, shiny weapon, step in and holla
I gotta hit the kids that shit Hip Hop
The wack gets spit lot, the man bullshit stop
Yo they call lot and I accept the invitation
But I not try and snitch upon my ?inclamation?
On the real God, I'm good, a brother been in mediation
And my mind has been kenotic, kill the pres led a netion, Dres

[Outro: Nas]
Aiyyo Chi Ali hold ya head up in the peniles
