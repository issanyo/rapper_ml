[Produced by Havoc]

[Verse 1: Nas]
Got out the airport, the Mobb picked me up in the truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck, I ain't scared to get stuck
So what's the deal, Papi? You heard the feds almost got me?
I had the Cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating like Illuminati, network with catch a body experts
In retrospect to the foul connect
When I lost, but back then was my fault
Now it's time to floss, eye for a eye, what's mine is yours
I need a suite with the flowers complimentary at Trump Towers
Sit at the table, we can build for hours
On getting rich, it's a cinch, take a glimpse
"The World Is Yours" written all over the blimps
Here's a toast to my foes, it's like a whole new beginning
With Quaaludes and cream and loads of women rocking linen
I got a plan to blow to Hiroshima, Japan
Moving niggas out the hood and just divide it with fam
Ay yo the bitches, like Gee Money said to his man
Will ride the dick like a horse with the cowboy brand

[Hook: Havoc]
Give it up fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the tables if it's not about dough
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, nigga rep your clique

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Yo son, I'm feeling it
Opposition want me dead, concealing shit
From gats got me living, kid, rushing through my pyramid
You secondary, go against the grain then you adversary
Had to bury niggas on my side that snitch
Ran his mouth like a bitch, now he's laying in the ditch
That he dug for himself, on his grave I had to piss
Scud missile, never miss you, hit you
Scratch you off my list, Gemstar rip through
Your mental, deeper, you ain't having it, me neither
It's drama, ain't got time for no breathers
Rapper Noyd make these niggas into believers

(Yo Noyd, what up with this cat right here, man? Word up)

[Verse 3: Big Noyd]
The tough guy screwing me? I guess he got plans to ruin me
He wanted to do me, slowly but surely I peeked his fast ass a bit early
Grabbed him by his wig, his shit was curly
(Put the chrome to his dome) let him know it's never early
You can slide, before I snatch the heat from his side
Saw the devil in despise by the look in his eyes
He was surprised how I snatched him up
Regulated his gat and backed him up
Stepped to the side, P, blast him up

[Verse 4: Prodigy]
Yeah yo, cannons erupt, you got strucked up abstrusely
Some rapper nigga playing thug tried to approach me
(Yo, kill that nigga, man!)
All I remember was I shot for his throat, G
You see big guns in 3-D, it's haunting
It gets deep, fucking with these Chinese
Thai weed burning my hip from hot gats
Burning my lip from roach clips
Catch me on the 40th and Bootlegger, in the AM
These ante meridian cats, insomniacs
Four in the morning we throwing back some Cognac juice
Letting gats loose, the blue van blitz through
D's pissed too, couldn't find the pistol
Ay yo, hopped out the Lexus, holding my necklace
I'm bent off some next shit, gasoline with a kerosene twist
Stumbling, placing my gun right, it's slipped down its caliber
Looking for chicks that he can stab now
Numbed up from my fiery cup of hell juice
Some singed nectar, Satan's fountain of youth
Mega action, bitches all around ready to fuck
Big asses, you raw-dogging shit, pressing your luck
My pipe game's like a night train
Top speed through your womb-piece
Rated X to say the least

[Hook: Havoc]
Give up the pussy fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the 'tel if it ain't a freak show
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, niggas rep they clique
Give it up fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the tables if it's not about dough
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, niggas rep your clique
