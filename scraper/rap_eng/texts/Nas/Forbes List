[Intro: Dave East]
I can see millions, billions
Foreigns, all that
I can see myself gettin a lot of money
I can see the condo... Miami

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Uhh, I can see me in a sports car (I see it)
On 16th, shots of brown at the sports bar (shots)
At 16, I was hiding report cards
Now I see myself getting where I'm going, no OnStar
GPS for that money, got the directions (got 'em!)
Monday night hit the strip joint and cop a section (whole side)
Niggas ain't fighting no more, we got some weapons (strapped)
Do it for the culture, I really come from the essence
Essence magazine, brown skin
Cousin from the Heights
She told me he got some pounds and (word?)
Said he out in Brooklyn, he be back up town around ten (copy)
Mad traffic in the crib going through it with housin'
If I get evicted, play my bitch crib
You don't want no drama, niggas pop up where your kids live
Set up where your wife work
I be dressed like I'm just coming to see if your lights work
Shooter do it just cause he love me, nigga that's light work

[Chorus: Dave East]
I see me in that Ghost with a lot of smoke (a lot)
I see me gettin low if you gotta go (kill 'em)
I see me in that foreign
See me with that Gucci umbrella when it's pouring
That's how I see it
I see me with connects from the motherland
Backwood in my left, pistol in my other hand
I see me on the Forbes list, see me in them Porsches
Still rocking all white Forces

[Verse 2: Nas]
I rock tuxes, busters
Clusters cover my watches
Drop mustard color, foreign cars in garages
Only queens I fuck with, CÃ©line clutches my bitch
Bullet holes in my foes
Side chick got a side chick
Hunter green Nikes, they don't like me
I see niggas cuffing their lady when they sight me (sight me...)
Backwood blowing, 'gnac be pouring, it's nothing
A rap Benjamin Button, Nasty Don, rich milly on the arm
Been literally rich since '96
Still would've hit my enemies with a TEC in '96
Exotic materials on the neck and fly whips
I was fresh out the 'jects, decked out to def
Y'all witnessed it, I could fill you in
Real millionaire shit, escargot, front lawn like a dealership
Who I rep, 10th Street, 12th Street
Plus the Vernon family and that's word to Yammy, word

[Chorus: Nas]
You see me in that Ghost with a lot of smoke (see it)
I see me gettin low if you gotta go (see it)
You see me in my foreign
See me with that Margiela umbrella when it's pouring
That's how I see it
I see me with connects from the motherland
Backwood in the left, cash in my other hand
See I'm truer than the Forbes list, see me in them Porsches
Still rocking them '84 Jordans

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I see me in Dubai, me and Buda high (Buda)
Moving pies, I still see his mother through the sky
I see tan lines, models, haters be anti
I was smoking gram dimes, playing foster with franchise
(My nigga) I see myself in that GQ magazine
I was low, nobody in the streets knew I had a fiend (low)
He had a green Honda Civic, parked it on my block
I could drive it for days just made sure he had a rock (that's a fact)
Waking up smoking kush, I could see the envy
Weed and Henny, that's the reason this evil in me
I want it all, I ain't letting 'em keep a penny
I see me slumped in that Bentley bumping the best of Biggie
Shouts to Philly, I see me and Freaky laughing (Freak!)
I see Nut in a Porsche, I see a Lil' in a Aston (Lil'!)
I can see the city from a penthouse view
Married streets, the avenue just said "I do" (ha)

[Chorus: Dave East]
I see me in that Ghost with a lot of smoke (see it)
I see me gettin low if you gotta go (see it)
I see me in that foreign
See me with that Gucci umbrella when it's pourin
That's how I see it (Gucci)
I see me with connects from the motherland
Backwood in my left, pistol in my other hand (LIGHT IT!)
I see me on the Forbes list, see me in them Porsches
Still rockin all white Forces (all white)

[Outro: Dave East]
That's just how I see myself
You ask me how I see them, I see myself in five years
Rich nigga, what the fuck you think, huh
That's how I see it
