NEW YORK [6x]

(AND IT FEELS REAL HOMIE
THEN WILL YOU'LL BE ON A ROLL)

[ThomasTekno:]
Uh uh
Aye yo
Come visit the city
That don't never sleep
But hold tight to ya luggage
If you know what I mean
So stay up on ya feet
If you ain't tryna get beat
Cause we always
On tha move yo
Time iz money b
Quickly son
That's what tha fuck we do
Legends over there
In ya eye and pointing view
The birthplace of Hip-Hop
Don't ever forget
Tryna be slick?
Cool it
You in tha big apple bitch
