[Intro: Nas & Dr. Dre]
Motherfucking Dre, whassup my nigga
Sup Nas
Chilling God
Niggas is up in here hittin' some of this chronic, nigga
Yeah and this chocolate over here, they mixed this shit up
Nigga, hit some of this shit, nigga
Yeah, lemme get that, I'm tired of these niggas
Niggas stealin' beats and niggas is stealin' your whole techniques and shit, niggas wanna take everything from a nigga man
Yeah yeah yo Nas it's like this man
Niggas can't do it like I do it, d'yaknahmsayin'
Just like niggas can't do what you do
Right, right
You know, can't nobody fuck with this
You know all these niggas out here just
Talkin' this East coast West coast bullshit
Niggas need to kill that shit
And make some money, y'know
Word
Fuck it
What is it, what is it God
Let's get together, make some fuckin' music
Right, that's what I'm sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
And get paid, and just, let that be it
All these niggas talkin all this bullshit
Better sit back, and watch what happens

[Verse 1: Nas]
The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out
Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable '86 shit
Foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Soliciting ill editions of that Murder I Wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
In the heat of the moment
Like Farrakhan said we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes chrome kitted up
Calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts
I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutching gats quick to bust
But knowing how these niggas tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is comin

[Verse 2: Nas]
In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands to make examples
Substantial amounts you owe to the firm
Crew, Firm affliation, paper chasing
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be real
But impostors to Hoffa
Nas plague kills
Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP
A hundred G cars
Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout, murder material serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's something venereal
But back in stereo

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is comin

[Verse 3: Nas]
From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent stay splifted
Control the rap game you got it twisted
Dr. Dre way, the Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it
Sip Cris' push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all Nas y'all
Fly gangsta wavy hair teeth chipped in
My shit bump in the courtroom drunk, links truck
Rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero black DeNiro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro diamond roll, hustling low
Pro-file white gold style, raking bloody dough by the pile
Shot down still alive he struggling for the phone
Fo-fo blow him, when homicide comes
These three words are sung

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is comin

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Check this out, it's Nasty Nas, and Dr. Dre
East meets West
That's how we making it happen
That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Ayo Nas let's get this money
Let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherfucking clowns out here
Riffing and beefing about this bullshit
Yo while they doing all that
We just gon' kick back with these honies
This Cristal and party to the year 2G

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
