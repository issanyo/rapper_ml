[Verse 1: Nas]
Everybody's an enemy
Telling me lies and it's killing me
Why they all want to get rid of me?
Everybody's my enemy
Several try to disguise the devil in them
Wanting to get into my cerebellum
But I'm ready and willing to tell them
That I can't f with them
Exhale so hard it got my chest swelling
Like my dick does when watching naked women
Do sick stuff on my porn collection on television

[Chorus: Nas]
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
They all just pretend to be
Fuck everybody this is to all of you all
‘Cause everybody is an enemy
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
They all just pretend to be
Fuck everybody this is to all of you all
‘Cause everybody is an enemy

[Verse 2: Nas]
Watching my own back
Strapped in chrome, to my homies
Where the tombstones at, where the hoes at?
‘Cause too many didn't act like dikes, hermaphrodites
With benzene, amen
Look at the trash they biting
The life in times is kinda weaker
Like the time and life of the Sandman
On Apollo Theater
Imagine that another black with a hook
Who pulls the wack talent off the stage
I'm enraged

[Chorus: Nas]
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
They all just pretend to be
Fuck everybody this is to all of you all
‘Cause everybody is an enemy
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
They all just pretend to be
Fuck everybody this is to all of you all
‘Cause everybody is an enemy

[Bridge]
You fill your lies around me
And you think you won
You feel you can control me
With the things you've done
You think that you can take me?
You think that you can play me?
You're going to start to hate me
I feel that you disgraced me
You think that you can take me?
You think that you can play me?
You're going to start to hate me
I feel that you disgraced me
You think that you can take me?
You think that you can play me?
You're going to start to hate me
I feel that you disgraced me
You think that you can take me?
You think that you can play me?
You're going to start to hate me
I feel that you disgraced me
You think that you can take me?
You think that you can play me?
You're going to start to hate me
I feel that you disgraced me

[Chorus: Nas]
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
They all just pretend to be
Fuck everybody this is to all of you all
‘Cause everybody is an enemy
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
They all just pretend to be
Fuck everybody this is to all of you all
‘Cause everybody is an enemy
