[Intro]
Order in court, order in the court
No one else but Mr. Jones has the right to be speaking right now
Order in the court or I’m gonna start making some arresting here
You don’t belong in the court house anyway, your rap concert has been canceled
Order in my court, …

[Verse 1: Nas]
I wake up, wake up in the morning shake my third leg in the toilet
Uzi on my night stand, I’m the man you go to war with
Not the man you go to war against,
Patience I get you if that means I can’t sleep a whole year
I get you, I'm official not a tisket, a tasket
I put you in the casket with a biscuit
The ratchet, the smoke a biscuit, the planted trees advanced weed
Doomed forsakers you fucking fake bloods like movie makeup
I flow tight as tootie bracers, who he hating us
I’ll be on the state bus, shackles is my eight bus
Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers
I’m the shit for ages, my clip steel wheel … gangsters
Click still move like free masons, so we’re from on the flow from the law
Cause large is all across the nation, Nas is bread for the plan
The hold the grand dragon head in his hand
Come and get me, here I am
Pok’em, pok’em

[Hook]
I’m not a law prayer, so you could tell your mayor
I’m a non-stop driven by poetry slayer
One, two, three, down for the count
The result my lyrics oh yes, no doubt (X2)
Pok’em, pok’em

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
The good man in me gets money and stay on the path
But the Pimp shit in me says yo, keep looking for ass
My daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snows
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait till
You’re grown, when in love you will know
Everybody’s gotta dream I hope to wish to own a six times two
… against who I don’t know
So one who fed you won’t blow, you won’t eat, you won’t cake
Pay mistake, blaming me for their failures I'm fresh
Getting tale single breasted
A lip brush is sense less some pimp shit
A women hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, cause he’s still with her
She take his cash give it to some other real nigga, like me
Pok’em, pok’em, pok’em
