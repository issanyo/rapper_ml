[Verse 1]

She wakes up blood drenched and covered in sweat
Her A cup's unclenched
She doesn't expect to be the victim of a man her mother respects who doesn't respect her daughter or her mother except
When he waits for her to fall asleep and subtly lets himself into her bedroom and then unbuckles his jet black jeans and a belt
Before he suddenly gets on top of her to cover her mouth
He doesn't expect what happens next she'll proudly say she doesn't regret because she's heard about it from her younger cousin
She let him have his way with her the first one dozen
He gets violent this time around because she doesn't just let him have his way with her
He should have a dozen regrets by now but the look on his face isn't one of regret
He smothers her, gets in between her legs, unbuttons her set of pyjamas
The struggle then gets bloody when she reaches under her set of pillows for a kitchen knife
And then stabs him right in the gut with her left hand but if he dies
She and her mother are left stranded
And if he lies covered and dressed bandaged when the SAPS uncover the dressed bandit
Trying to address what she did with her left hand
It doesn't matter cause she's the reason they're left stranded
And I would tell you all about it but the God knows that all I need is one mic

[Hook]

I'll tell you all about it, the women and children imprisoned by scars but all I need is one mic
And I'll tell you all about it from the alcohol abuse by Uncle Paul, abuse but all I need is one mic
I'll tell you all about it, the women and children imprisoned by scars but all I need is one mic
And I'll tell you all about it from the alcohol abuse by Uncle Paul, abuse

[Verse 2]

It begins with a couple of kisses
He subtly switches his hands and then touches her misses
A couple of kisses later he's encouraging blisses and mumbling wishes and then puts her aside like he's done with the dishes
She stubbornly misses the signs of his cunning
Dismisses the lack of a condom, benign, and comfortably kisses the son of a missus goodbye while she's wondering if this was an act of love or is that just something fictitious?
She tries to whisper I love you but he shuns her
She wishes she wasn't just another number, just one of his bitches
One of her wishes are granted when she suddenly misses her period and that's the sum of a couple of kisses mixed with his cunning and wishes, touching, encouraging kisses but who am I judge?
That's just none of my business
She decided to keep it and did stomach the vicious gossiping about her secret for nine months
But, to keep it a secret was impossible
But that's no reason to leave it wrapped in some plastic for the garbage man to receive it across the street from a hospital where they could just keep it
And I would tell you all about it but the God knows that all I need is one mic

[Verse 3]


I'll tell you all about it, I'll tell you why they call him Professor, a blesser
Who's in charge of the mess a little party and pressure
Some Bicardi, Professor does to Charlie
Vanessa was never ready to lose her virginity but at this party, a pessimistic Charlie, the pressure quickly discarded Vanessa's virginity, her dignity considered garbage
A blesser was never an option for Mbali
I guess the city, Pabi, a Hector
Mixed with Ferrari's, Da L.E.S, the clique and Nthabi
A lesbian chic, a Charlie ate and disgested Mbali
She's late, I guess that the money she got for her 'groceries' is why she's sleeping with Nathan and Charlie
Taken to parties by men who have a Wraith or a Harley lying around in the bank just for some change at the bar
Thee Range's, Ferrari she saw after Jason
WASABI is her favourite place to eat now
Faith and Pulane are sleeping with the same guy
Let's call him Jason, Mbali's ex-boyfriend but what if both Jason, Mbali are HIV positive?
Then both Faith and Pulane could be HIV positive, plus Nathan and Charlie
Not to mention all of men who've seen and tasted Mbali
Jason, Mbali could've been safer than sorry if Jason wore a condom before he tasted a Tlali
And I would tell you all about it but the God knows that all I need is one mic
