[Intro]
New Nas... woo!!!

[Chorus]
Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(Just ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(All my niggas gon' ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at? (yeah)
Where them dimes at?
(Fuck them other niggas)

Where them dimes at?
Where them dimes at?
(Word to mother, niggas)
Where where them dimes at?
Where where them dimes at?

[Verse 1]
I slow dance with the Devil
Snow setting in the bezzle
Mo' sipping, phantom, bumping Aaron Neville
Polo black scented, eyes squinted
Air Force One's, with my own pattern in it
Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy
Pagan holidays, are way far from my reality
Fart through Evisu jeans, lethal green
Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens
With no AKs, I'm the ambassador
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart
Lot of blood gon' splash in war
Task force homicide, federalies gon' harass
But y'all ain't never seen nothing
Not a word not a hint, on the kid from the Project Bench
That went Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate
Island Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent
To get the best man, y'all niggas ain't silencing shit
Ya bitch been wanna polish the dick
The big Benz, I'ma model ya chick
With Zac Posen, cash froze her
Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over
Cold like ice, more chains than slaves
Dangerous ways, Poltergeist change the channel
Roll the dice, I bring change when I gamble
I could sell sand to a Arab, hiding my gun handle

[Chorus]
Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(Just ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(All my niggas gon' ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at? (yeah)
Where them dimes at?
(Fuck them other niggas)

Where them dimes at?
Where them dimes at?
(Word to mother, niggas)
Where where them dimes at?
Where where them dimes at?

[Verse 2]
The ill whip pusher, my spit wet ya
If you stand close to the woofer
Betcha get sprayed by my lecture
Any club with ladies or dimes, I'm a regular
Give it up smooth, I ain't begging ya
Intelligent brainiac, brains maniac
Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that
Eat with my elbows top of the table
Street etiquette with speech impediments
And still see presidents, no matter who paid
Cause you ain't take the last dollar made
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it
Money's my bitch, and we stay intimate
Ask about Nashwan, could ask about Jung'
Ask about Bravehearts, and ask where I'm from
Q-Boro, specifically The Bridge
Don't ask no more questions, y'all know what it is

[Chorus]
Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(Just ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(All my niggas gon' ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at? (yeah)
Where them dimes at?
(Fuck them other niggas)

Where them dimes at?
Where them dimes at?
(Word to mother, niggas)
Where where them dimes at?
Where where them dimes at?

[Verse 3]
Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking
Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
Financier, skull doo wrapped up
Mob life, prizefights, plasma TV's or first roll
Diversified dough in my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit coeptis
That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria
My criteria, smoke cigars
Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock and Roll
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing
Almost put a million cash in my mommy casket
Seen more green than St. Patrick, trick

[Chorus]
Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(Just ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(All my niggas gon' ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at? (yeah)
Where them dimes at?
(Fuck them other niggas)

Where them dimes at?
Where them dimes at?
(Word to mother, niggas)
Where where them dimes at?
Where where them dimes at?

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(Just ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(All my niggas gon' ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at? (yeah)
Where them dimes at?
(Fuck them other niggas)

Where them dimes at?
Where them dimes at?
(Word to mother, niggas)
Where where them dimes at?
Where where them dimes at?

[Outro]
Just ride with it
All my niggas gon' ride with it
Yeah, fuck them other niggas
Word to mother, niggas
