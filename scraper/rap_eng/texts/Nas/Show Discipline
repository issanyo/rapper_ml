[Jadakiss]
Yoooo!!
Uh, uh-huh, uh

[Verse: 1 (Jadakiss)]
Yo yo yo yo aiyyo
Never will it stop
Handguns with double digit shots
I move work on other niggas blocks
Leave out the club wit a another niggas watch
Body that man and let other niggas watch
Only thing worse than a coward, is a coward with power
Gotta kill him in the shower, our
Beats is knockin, hooks is rare
Earned my spot, nobody ain't put me here
Burnt my block, I had a fiend cookin wit beer
Like the Bobby Womack of crack
Might see me in the burgundy thing, or the black on black
Matter of fact, go get ya chrome
Cause I rather be, broke together than rich alone
Clappin em' down, backin em' down (uh)
Fuck what ever happened before, I'm whats happenin' now

[Hook: Nas (Jadakiss)]
Now gangstas live, gangstas die
Grab ya guns, soldiers ride (show discipline nigga!)
Kill ya moms, kill ya pops, kill ya seed
Kill ya girl (Its principle nigga!)
Sell ya crack, sell ya coke
Sell ya E, sell ya smoke (you hustlin nigga!)
Grab ya nine, grab ya pound
Grab ya tec, grab ya pump (you bustin at niggas!,wha)

[Verse: 2 (Nas)]
We Bravehearted, I had bitches tryin to posion me
Niggas who kilt loyalty
Set me up, vested up my move accordingly
I ducked icepicks and nightsticks by cops who rookies
Hard to be righteous, and when life can just stop for pussy
Niggas killin over hoes, guns concealed in their clothes
Bodies at funerals, touch them they feel like they froze
Speech, totally calm, holdin dead rappers dome in my palm
Burnin flag, plus its on the qu'ran, its on the bible
Plus America cause that every car thats drivin
Holdin the homeless sign you focus you know its Nas, the
Prince of the globe, leave no prints of the toast
Played with Ouija boards, burned frankencense wit a ghost
I've learned, to do good plus erase the evil
And do what it takes to keep a smile on the face of my people
I was raised by the apes in this dark creepshow, but yo

[Hook]

[Verse: 3 (Jadakiss)]
Yo yo yo yo yo yo
Think bout when I splatter ya mask(yea)
My niggas is happy, ya momma is sad
If ya niggas is riders, the drama will last
If ya niggas a snitch, been judgin my ass
They said I'm too famous to run
So when I empty out this clip, I'm changin the gun
The realer the beef, the longer the clip
Murder ya mans, I'm gone in the mist
Caught his girl after dark so we talked to bitch
We ain't care cause the whore wasn't shit
Doll, I ain't takin the L or waistin a shell
I bring the heat like I'm satan itself
Fuck if you hard, fuck if you soft, long as you lost
Dick in the dirt, shit in ya drawers
Ill make ya grandmother get on the floor
Tie you up, then beat you to a pulp, say this is a war
If'n the four, mackin a pump, actin I dump
Throw you out the window then act like you jump

[Hook 2x]
