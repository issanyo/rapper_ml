[Intro - J Cole Interview]
You"re making food that doesn't help
It actually hurts us
That food is killing us
But it makes money
You know what I mean
That television show is hurting us
But it makes money
This music is killing us
It's rotting us
But it makes money
That's the system we live in
That goes for any industry
You could look at it and go
That's not helping the world
But it's making money

[Verse 1]
The price of a dollar
I want that designer
I'm out of alignment
On line to line up your momma
Wit' white like a lama
Strapped wit' a lama
Moving consignment
Confinement
If that Impala
Pull up all sideways on me
My niggas gon' holla
Free Homie all day
But cannot put up a dollar
I'm stuck in a system
I cannot get out of
I'm labeled a sinner
My children gon' follow
Is this what I wanted
For niggas to follow
Is this what I wanted
For bitches to swallow
Is this what ya' wanted
Nigga spittin' all hollow
My nigga get off the block
Kick rocks dawg you slippin' on slaloms
Hittin' the bottom
Is not what I solemn
Want but I gotta
Get me a dollar
Give me a dollar
I'll give you this product
All for some profit
Son I gotta get this

[Chorus]
Paper
Land of snakes, we seen acres
Money money money gon' save us
Gotta do these numbers, don't wait up
Weight up, cuz we eatin' all day ya'll
Chasin' dollar signs
Empty pockets, in the projects traumatized
Dollars on my mind
Dollar for my rhymes
You know we all about that mother fuckin'
Money, money, money
All these bitches gon' love me, love me
But it's numbers over everything
So I'm out here tryna get it everyday
In each and every way
Nigga gonna get it anyway
Cuz you know it's money over everything
Money over everything
Now we grindin' tryna do these numbers
Steady grindin' tryna do these numbers
Tryna do these numbers

[Verse 2]
They say you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
Well rocks was thrown in mine
As I unwind this ball of yarn
And roll on lines
And blow your mind
Before I blow like mines
Once upon a time
Check this dialation
My eyes witnessed this on blood related
Crack cracked my foundations
Left me aggravated
Turned me to a fuckin' brutalizer
A crew de-sizer
Accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissin' in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Hissing snakes slither for paper
Biting they neighbors
I'll catch a caper
And crack a copper
In the head with loose tongues
These bruised shoes manuever proper
Through the swamp of
Loch ness monsters and the mobsters
Tryna prosper so I conjure
Plots of conglomerate dollars
If I could dodge these shots and these sirens
I could build these blocks from the bottom

[Bridge]
I could school the youth if I told the truth
Know we over due
True spitter hittin' the booth
Hoping to overshoot
Dreams in fruition
My mission
I'm wishing for the acquisition
Funds in the coalition
Thugs and we over viscious
Bout' our business
I'm bout' to bend this rap shit
Kid who pitchin' in
Nigga I'm bout' to flip these stacks
Ain't no time to slack
Gotta get these raps off
Like I'm flippin' packs
Ain't no holdin' back
Gotta get that

[Chorus]
Paper
Land of snakes, we seen acres
Money money money gon' save us
Gotta do these numbers, don't wait up
Weight up, cuz we eatin' all day ya'll
Chasin' dollar signs
Empty pockets, in the projects traumatized
Dollars on my mind
Dollar for my rhymes
You know we all about that mother fuckin'
Money, money, money
All these bitches gon' love me, love me
But it's numbers over everything
So I'm out here tryna get it everyday
In each and every way
Nigga gonna get it anyway
Cuz you know it's money over everything
Money over everything
Now we grindin' tryna do these numbers
Steady grindin' tryna do these numbers
Tryna do these numbers

[Outro - Kendrick Lamar Sample]
Ima be the greatest to ever do this shit
