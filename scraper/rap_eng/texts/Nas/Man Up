(feat. Nas)

It's over, it's over, it's over

What the hell do you want from me
Why dont you leave me alone
Its been a done deal with you for a minute
So you need to get along

Whats the problem
Why is it so difficult for you to see
That I dont want you no more
If I was you id be embarrassed
For the way I carry on

Yous a grown ass man
Dawg you can't even stand on ya own two feet
Now your lookin my way
Its too late cuz you messed it up with me
You needa change your tone
Get your swagger goin
You gotta hold your own
So dont call my phone
Cuz you ain't gotta home with me no more

Get it out your head baby
Its over, yes its the end
No matter what you try to do
We will never be again
I try to be patient
But I can't take it
Get ahold of yourself
It will never be you again
Understand it'll be someone else

Yous a grown ass man
Dawg you can't even stand on you own two feet
Now your lookin my way
Its too late cuz you messed it up with me
You needa change your tone
Get your swagger goin
You gotta hold your own
So dont call my phone
Cuz you ain't gotta home with me no more

This is the last time for this conversation
Can't do it
Your excuses are so amazing
Get throught it
I know your trying to change my mind
But you know your only wasting my time
What do we got to go through this
Im sick of the b.s. im done
So youll never get this again

NAS
Hey Ama-Ama-Amerie
Ain't no need for anger
He a lil boy just give him the middle finger
Call your big brother, bitch slugga, weight plugga
He gonna get enough for dialin up ya numba
Coward, this homie got a twat pushed outward
Chicks with dicks dont belong in yo mix
Long as you straight, playin back in the quarter eights
Steppin in zeppies, reppin d.c., ya stink

Fine wines and diamonds, crembole on da plate
And yall girls relate so put yo hands up
And what, tell the mutha fucka to man up
