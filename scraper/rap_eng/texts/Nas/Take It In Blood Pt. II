[Hook x2]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
(Street rules and jewels to help teach a hungry crew)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's!
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
(In a world of the monkey-see, monkey-do)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, Italiano model, trained like Cus D'Amato
Guard ya plan, recline low, black Milano
I'm blessed, God, feelin' Kosher
One in the top of the toaster, proper ghost ya
My gun is cocked in the holster, dumped quick
Chasin' my dick made a bum bitch rich, stylish
Heard ya naked in jail flicks
Mamacita, Black Widow, Turner be a back seater
Satin pillows, a pimpstress in willow
Cookin' my blow and head slow, eyes swellin'
Disorder the grain, I gotta split my wife melon
So I can see the seven seas of my circumference
???, polish ya pistols like a gunsmith
Clever, my mama told me, "Take cheddar
By slugs and drugs, whatever calculate better"
When cake's measured, lock the front door, secure
See the gleamin' white crystal when it's pure

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, fuck the snake hoes
And jealous ass niggas that smash your Benz windows
Detectin' fake nigga signals, yo, live niggas get it too
Scarin' rappers like the Fed time Gotti was acquitted to
Blood-shot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Kicks matchin' my shit my gun on
Thinkin' a name for my man's Umbro, spillin' Puerto Rican rum on Imaginary graves, put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints, scream religious praise
Heat graze the baby, yo, foul shit made a welfare mom crazy
Mo' bodies drop by the ratio, paces blow
Grizzly thoughts for makin' doe
Haitian bitch cast a spell on my life for cash-flow
So, now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money, when it comes to mine, take it in blood

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, foggy and shit, trees lit up errywhere
It's like that there, yanahmean? Executive class material
Most official Queens representative on the motherfuckin' ji-doint
This is how it's goin' down, sun-up to sun-down, put ya gun down
