Heavy like an ice freezer deadly not nice either
Ill fuck the ho with pussy that's mind blowing
Do my thug dance in clubs with my nine showing

[Verse 2c: Horse]
??? a nigga that would kill something over something small
The one you can't ??? with unless you paid in full
The one that hold grudges cause gun games for free
The only thing you wetting and splittin is ???
Im the one that lift the skirts up on fake ass rappers
That be killin for a long time but now it don't happen
All them tough guys is wanksters they ??? me in their songs
Im a braveheart till death so I got to die strong
A big man that's troublesome and follow no rules
Run through crews after smoking blunts and sippin on brews
Disrespecter pistol whippin hustlers for their cheddar
The deebo of the rap game but walk with a beretta
My heart is made of stone my eyes is filled with blood
Survivors of the street wars yall niggas know whats up
From the projects to penthouse yall niggas better look out
Before these braveheart motherfuckers put they gun in your mouth
