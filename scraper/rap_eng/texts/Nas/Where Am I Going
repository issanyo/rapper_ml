Uhh, where am I going?
Where am I? Where the hell am I?
Yo, it's ill...

[Verse 1]
Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily, I find 'em just at the right time
Mac in my right arm, tequila bottle in my left arm
Like Christion, watching my life go
CanÂ´t do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let 12 spin, hop in my Benz
Push it to the limit, buck-sixty, who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit wit'
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth, I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed, I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me, I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo, nigga, watch me

[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 2]
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell these niggas nothing though
Bullets wake 'em up well
Take 'em to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark, homie
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle, not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze, blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in television
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas, expect kilos
But what they not seeing is police expect RICO
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up, blastin' A.C., going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice

[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
Yo, I'll ride to the end of the road, if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, I try to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 3]
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around, who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start to feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib, I'm tired...

[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, all alone in the zone
Drunk by myself
