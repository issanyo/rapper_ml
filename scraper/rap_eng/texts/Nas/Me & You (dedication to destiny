[Verse 2: Nas]
Even though you’ll be grown soon
You gotta stand on your own two
Please listen what daddy told you
I know, you think, that i’m old school
You’ll see that i was right soon
One day, you will meet the right groom
And then, you will see your life bloom
And then you know, what’s right, for you

[Verse 3: Nas]
Respect your mom, no one will replace her
She’s the one who went through the labor
(if i had it all)
But you don’t owe her no favor
But her respect is due
See, daddy just wanna show you
(if i had it all)
All the heartache i go through

For you
