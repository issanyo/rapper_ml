[Intro: Rick Ross]
(M-M) Michael Williams
Renzel Ravioli (Woo!)
(Hahaha) Ugh
This  some country western shit right here (Huh!)
(Yeah!) Like Quentin Tarantino
M-M-Maybach Music

[Chorus: Nas]
Yo, you ain't standin' on your word, you lose respect
Man up, check, chest out, check
Chin up, check, discipline, check
Listenin', check

[Verse 1: Nas]
Picture what your opponent is thinking inside the square
This is like chess, strategize in the ring
He tryna be a father, but he lost his father to the same thing (Check)
Walkin' on blood stained ground, gladiator school
America, see you ain't raised no fool, catch this fade, is you brave?
Try to know what to expect out here
Fought every fight, what's left is the fight of death out here
Try to take my last breath, my air, had to check my fear (Hmm)
That's why they respect Nasir, feel me
Y'all witnessin' what you never seen
Needin' nothing attracts everything, the resurrection of a king

[Chorus: Nas]
Man up, check, chest out, check
Chin up, check, discipline, check
Listenin', check
Check
Man up, check, chest out, check
Chin up, check, discipline, check
Listenin', check
My nigga, let your nuts hang
Check

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
(Maybach Music)
Dark denim jeans, boots for the winter breeze
Never on the wiretaps let's give 'em somethin' they can see
Born to be a boss, so nail me to the holy cross
Life is a lesson, bless a nigga with a fortune (Huh)
Speak with respect, seats to the Mets
We came from the streets, you just some geeks with a check
Cuban links swing like a leech from my neck
Make a mural of my face when I'm deceased with the best
Balenciaga sneaks (Huh), Balenciaga socks (Huh)
Dark-skinned nigga, but the brightest in the spot
Dreamin' of the top, boy I mighta signed with Kotch
Carol city nigga, move a mountain with a block (Woo)
Virgil with the white (Ugh), murdered over kite (Ugh)
Wholesale price it's like it's fashion oversite (Woo)
Doubled up the shows and I tax 'em for the flights (Huh)
I'm owed by the code, so don't make me ask you twice

[Chorus: Nas]
Man up, check, chest out, check
Chin up, check, discipline, check
Listenin', check
Check
Man up, check, chest out, check
Chin up, check, discipline, check
Listenin', check
My nigga, let your nuts hang
Check

[Outro: Nas]
My nigga, let your nuts hang
My nigga, let your-
My nigga, let your nuts hang
My nigga, let your-
Nuts hang
My nigga, let your-
My nigga, let your-
My nigga, let your-
Nuts hang
My nigga, let your-
