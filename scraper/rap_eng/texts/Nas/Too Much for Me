Chorus-
Said it ain't to much for me
To have you next to me
I can't believe it
All the things i do
To keep you loving me
And its just to much for me
To not have you by my side
Cause no matter what your going through
You know that im gon' ride yea

Nas-
You a brave girl
Im a brave heart
And car heart
And champion hunnies
You in the benz buggy with the fullies
I ride beside ya
We about to pull a all nighter
Im super freak like Rick James
Sex in rangers
Parked on dangerous blocks
You like it when the strangers watch
Im looking out for cops
You a girl with no fear people put ya hands in the air
For the GQ man of the year
That bentley that polstry leather, the leather
That be up in the coats i wear
Wherever i go so there ya have it
Cashmere fabrics never caught in last years garments
Holsters under armpits chauffers and the charms lit
And the coders holding on the dons wrist
She got the ill will chain on
Turqouise boots sayin god son
This the theme song

Chorus-Amerie

Baby-
You know the size of this sh*t
I flips it quickly loose this trouble for these people get with me
Holla at my hoes 'cause i dip my bitches
From gold to platinum from rag to riches

Worldwide riding in the benz with a scroller
In your city tear ya mall up
Pimp fly bitches and tear their walls up
