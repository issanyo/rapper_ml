Chorus
Champagne all night
Anything you like
But tomorrow Romeo must die
Romeo must die
Romeo must die
Promise when I wake up
I won't be the same guy
Romeo must die
Romeo must die
Know that I told you
That I spoil yo a**
With all this money can buy
But Romeo must die
Romeo must die
Verse
I know I told you this life is a dream
But wake up this morning is reality
I know I told you this life is for free
That's just for me
That's a small technicality
I know I told you I told you
Then you caught up from all exposure
Then you caught takin all yo clothes off
Had a long talk said you needed a nose job
I started to dose off
How could I give you this S**t I work for
All this money I told you worth more
Come in yo work clothes I know you a stripper
I told you worth more
I'm such a good tipper
Clapping dat A**
Like a standing ovation
Sex like a movie
We film with location
I know I can with a strong resentation
But I gotta go I need all concentration
Chorus
Champagne all night
Anything you like
But tomorrow
Romeo must die
Romeo must die
Promise when I wake up
Won't be the same guy
Romeo must die
Romeo must die
Know dat I told you
I spoil yo A**
With all this money can buy
But Romeo must die
Romeo must die
Verse
About last night
I miss representing myself
I told you yo n***a a fool
And I ain't even hit it myself
I don't know wat you do to piss him off
I never planned to get this involved
Ain't nun wrong with some distance y'all
I'm tryna sweat this persistence off
Ima piss this off
When you be sippin some cristal
And yo stomach be foolin
Yo n****as be Wildin
You tend to make promises
To all these mollys and strippers
Askin for payday it's payday tuitions
I'm listening
You gotta plan and make 50 bands
I told you last night I pitched it in
Verse
Woke up and ain't even mentioned it
Don't even mention it that be coincidence
We ain't reporting no incident
Just know last night you was Juliet
And last night I got on yo insulet
Girl you got good brain
Funny how things changed
You ain't think of dat
You ain't think of dat
(No) next day I call you back
(No) you ain't think of that
Heard you got problems with n****as
That's sellin your dreams
But you ain't no chaser
Like meek and a milli
Want a man that will tell you positive things
But you ain't no lady
You sex and the city
I was wrong to tell you was too pretty
Iwas wrong to tell you was too pretty
How can I admit when I'm wrong
Only thing I can admit is
Is it you he still hittin
Chorus
Champagne all night
Anything you like
But tomorrow
Romeo must die
Romeo must die
Promise when I wake up
Won't be the same guy
Romeo must die
Romeo must die
Know dat I told you
I spoil yo A**
With all this money can buy
But Romeo must die
Romeo must die
