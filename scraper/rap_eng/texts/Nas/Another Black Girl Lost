[Hook]
I'm pregnant, don't know who the dad is
I'm happy, but this shit's the saddest
I'm maintaining, still keeping my status
Fuck what you haters say, my ass is still the fattest
Roll with the baddest, my girls in Gucci glasses
How could you pass this? Your loss
But I ain't tripping - I'm still the boss
I won't be another black girl lost
Lost, lost, lost, lost, Lost, lost
I wonâ€™t be another black girl lost

[Verse 1]
Brown and beautiful, black and stunning, light and delicious
Chocolate colored strawberry kisses and cherry lipstick
Very mystic, bald stitches her wig
Kinky curly and dread, goddess gon' grant my wishes
Tantalizing touches, succulent skin, we should wed
Start off broke then stay together 'til we make it big
My queen is english, Sojourner Truth, I could learn from you
Never Ike Turner you, but look what you turn and do like
Get out of order, you're not a supporter of my dream
Rich girl fantasy schemes, a good man she needs
But she young and she speeding, honey now, what's the reason?
You just met this nigga, think you owe him a fucking threesome
So you lustin' to have a baby by a Denver Nugget
You don't love him, you want security, baby, your bugging
Financial liberty you're after, it's how you live
But the blood test shows it's not even his kid

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Chanel bags, everything
She shopping every time she gets a wedding ring
This her 3rd marriage, 4 carats
Brand new Jag, deserves to have it
Temptation, she can't let go her dirty habits
Mid 30's, spendin' dough at Magic
She's dancin', romancin', she's up at Mansion
She fucks all my mans, and they pop the magnums
So now what you gonna do, the morning-after pill is way overdue
'Posed to get married, now you embarassed
Who does this kid belong to?
Promiscuous, cuz' she got touched by step-dad, sex at
Such a young age, if you was a virgin, I'd get mad
Sick society, blaming yourself so wrong
I highly respect you, bet that, strong, intelligent
This song ain't to poke fun of you, to get laughs
I just love you, really love you
Here for you, wanna trust you
Wanna cuff you, be my lady
But first, I gotta see the baby

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ladies, I believe in you
We gotta stop this craziness out here, though
We gotta get right
Because when we both get right, we both take flight
Us real men need you, for real
