[Verse 1]
It took alot for me to sit down and write these lines
It's not even that I've fell out of passion for the grime
Cah ik to get far im gonna have to grind
Im gonna have to look past tomorrow night

[Verse 2]
But my work rate shows that I've got no care
I guess u should call me cadet
Na his work rate has rose through the roof
Mines on the ground suen like my shoes
They say to win u first have to lose
Learn from mistakes & then learn toimprove

[Verse 3]
Have u noticed I tend to talk bout death
That mindstate there I haven't left
Move right or get left
Well im moving right
S-D-G-L Slow dudes get left
But i ain't rushing value what's next
Wake each morning yh I'm blessed

[Verse 4]
This music thing its a long shot
But if i try u can't say i did not
I don't wanna have a dead end job
Me I wanna get outta the blocks
Outta the blocks not on the streets
Living life L - Y - F and an E
Then settle down with a wifey
Thats the dream for most and for me
Learn compete and succeed

[Verse 5]
The first time i saw 5g's 5k 5 grand wateva
I was in the back  with it on the way to exeter
For the car it was the rest to be paid
That right there set my lane
Set my path & set my league
Learn compete achieve & succeed
Seeing my nan buying this car
Alone makes me wanna go far
Makes me wanna buy one for my marj
One for dad one for nan one for my brother

[Verse 6]
For everyone who meant i love ya
Even the day ones yh like sherene
She's proud and wants to see me succeed
Her my bigger sis uno
Blood related are we no
But still my sister despite that
Remember crying to ur dad
Now convos bout girls and that
Them funny and deep convos there
U allow me to get stuff off my chest
