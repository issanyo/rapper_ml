[Verse 1: Nas]
It's the late night greasy spoon patron, poolhall making
Big bets, midsection got the 8 in
Dior Christian pimping, got that penal system diction
Riffing, you don't want it you snitching
Spit a few at a traitor with that new AR
Try to kill me I'm the leader, that's coup d'etat
Streetsweepers in that Coup√© all black, bitches want my chipped tooth back
Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked
Squeeze a fifth with a grip as I dip from the paparazzi
Still playing numbers you can't stop me
Still wearing bundles and spark weed
If I ever say 'Queens get 'em', you know they got me
Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef
So lead by example or get trampled
Since Hip Hop is Dead, this is the N
Congratulations in order 'cause we did it again

[Hook: Nas]
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still getting it and don't even love the doe
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still ripping, and I don't even love the hoes
Still getting it and don't even love the doe
Steel gripping it, you know that I tug the fo'
Stay splifted cause you know that I love the dro

[Verse 2: Nas]
The style is taboo, the chain's offensive
Brain on airplanes, Gucci frames are vintage
The two Tec Don in Yukon's and Benzes
Chicks who suck other chicks tits like infants
The Apprentice but not Trump, I'm the nigga with Glocks and pumps
That you don't see much, sucker free from chumps
Homes with cobblestones in front of 'em
He's got guns in cummerbunds, so understand you under son
Don't make me have you running from a hundred guns
Don't make me grab your only son, I'm coming from
A place Tanqueray and weed's the only escape
From phonies who hate when you rolling with papes
That's why the god party with juicy models
They mob me, the gnarly, Charlie Luciano - hardly
Have to tell y'all, I kill y'all for spitting songs that involve me nigga
Original verbal assassin, have to carve me a nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yo this is Nas, Queens own

Queens Own
Queens Own
