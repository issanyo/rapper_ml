[Intro: Estelle & John Legend]
DJ Trauma
[?] this ya' boy, John Legend, what up, blud?
Hope you’re doing good
I'm ready for this mixtape
Really, I'm ready for this album
"All Of Me" coming out later this year
And I think we’re killing the game
I'm so excited, much love to you
Peace

[Chorus: Estelle & Nas & Both]
Let's just fall in love
So we could fall in love
Let's fall in love
We could fall in love
When it's real, it can last to the end
We could fall in love
Let's fall in love
Beyond the stars and the moonlit skies
Let's fall in love

[Verse 1: Estelle]
I see you, know you see me too 'cause you’re slowin’ down
Put some extra pep in my step now
I'm tryna be cool, make you turn around and check me out ’cause

[Pre-Chorus: Estelle]
We walk by each other daily
Something 'bout today says maybe
The street signs, the city lights
All the stars can lead me to you
And you know, if it's okay with you
Let's go, go to some place that we don’t know
Don't need a reason, baby
It might be crazy, the thing is

[Chorus: Estelle]
We should fall in love
We could fall in love
We could fall in love
Beyond the stars and the moonlit skies
Let's fall in love

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Let's go slow, we got all the time we could ever need
We could catch a movie and probably
We could get together more frequently
I still believe that

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend & Estelle]
We walk by each other daily
Something 'bout today says maybe
The street signs, the city lights
All the stars can lead me to you
And you know, if it's okay with you
Let's go, go to some place that we don't know
Don't need a reason, baby
It might be crazy, the thing is

[Chorus: Estelle, John Legend & Nas]
We should fall in love (let's fall in love)
We could fall in love (let's fall in love)
We could fall in love
Beyond the stars and the moonlit skies (let's go)
Let's fall in love

[Verse 3: Nas]
If it ain't us son, [?]
With all this Rosay and all these ****
Who dare violate? You must get stomped
Who the king of New York? And don't say Trump
Nas the name, I used to holla at dames
Let 'em ring the bell at the stock exchange
Put 'em in Chanel, her Reeboks were lame
Had her front row at the boxing ring
What happened to you, girl? You're not the same
Top floor [?], we're not playin'
Feelin' better than I ever did
Nothin' negative, ****** talk rhetoric
I'm a soldier of love, [?]
More life, Frank, only do it my way
It don't matter what the blogs say, I go hard like ain't nobody signed me

[Pre-Chorus: Estelle]
And you know, if it's okay with you
Let's go, go to some place that we don't know
Don't need a reason, baby
It might be crazy, the thing is

[Chorus: Estelle, John Legend & Nas]
We should fall in love (let's fall in love, let's fall in love)
We could fall in love (let's fall in love, let's fall in love)
We could fall in love
Beyond the stars and the moonlit skies
Let's fall in love
