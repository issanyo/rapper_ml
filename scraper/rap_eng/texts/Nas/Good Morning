[Intro: Nas (Ron Isley sample)]
Good morning, yeah
(Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Good morning, the same old jerks goin' to work
Garbage man pick up the dirt, the birds don't chirp
There's this nice lady I know, she always speak
With her two children, headed to the school building
Then rush home again to lit housin'
And they are puttin' out the new ceilings
Cause her shits is leakin'
Water keep drippin' down, so she beefin'
Husband keep cheatin', he've been out all-evenin'
Good morning, police shifts the hood is on-in'
So they drive around all-day with bench warrants
Eatin' donuts and sippin' on coffee
Ooops! Sudden stop, it spills on the walkie-talkie
"Damn, this nigga is a creep"
Whispers the police at the Wino in the middle of the street
With missin' front teeth twistin' blunts deep in the cut
It's my nigga so I holla what up, niggas good morning

[Chorus: singer (Ron Isley sample)]
Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah)
I didn't get a wake-up call from out there
(Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah)
So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing

Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah)
I didn't get a wake-up call from out there
(Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah)
So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing, good morning

[Verse 2: Nas]
Good morning, yawnin', dawn is now gone and
New day, toothpaste brushin' my screwface
Follow the light, it's just a great feelin'
And I love life, every minute is pure healin'
Can't you tell I'm much happy nowadays
No more child play, livin' life the foul way
My man just came home speedin'
Tryin' to catch up with 9 years of no freedom
The paper say, "They finally caught him"
He back in, I guess street life got too borin'
Kind of quiet, half the hood is still sleep
If you saw the night before you won't believe it's the same street
Put on my 'lands and, leave the Phantom
Take the low-whip for a trip up to Pan Pan's
Scramble egg whites and turkey bacon
"Ma, pass the hot sauce from out your apron"
Uh, good morning

[Chorus: singer (Ron Isley sample)]
Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah)
I didn't get a wake-up call from out there
(Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah)
So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing

Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah)
I didn't get a wake-up call from out there
(Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah)
So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing, good morning

[Outro: Ron Isley sample]
Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah
Yeah, yeah well, well
