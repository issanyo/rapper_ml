[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado]
Can’t start a fire without a flame
Can’t play the part without a game
Can’t feel the love without the pain
Can’t talk to me if you talk the same

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
When you’re burned out baby you gotta come down
Thought you had it figured out
Baby I could give you something
Baby I could give you something
Baby I could give you something
I know how to make something out of nothing
Baby I could give you something
Baby I could give you something
Baby I could give you something
I know how to make something out of nothing

[Verse 2: Nelly Furtado]
Can’t have a drink without a well
Can’t fall asleep without a spell
Can’t feel the wind without a kite
Can’t pack your bags without a knife

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
When you’re burned out baby you gotta come down
Thought you had it figured out
Baby I could give you something
Baby I could give you something
Baby I could give you something
I know how to make something out of nothing
Baby I could give you something
Baby I could give you something
Baby I could give you something
I know how to make something out of nothing

[Verse 3: Nas]
Ayo Tom Ford shades on, Cuervo and a shot glass
Fly eyes pretty smile plus she got class
Imma show you a lil something
But here’s the preview
When I speak sparks fly like grinding metal, I’m lethal
She's hot like liquid metal in T2
Whether flats or stiletto, red carpet or ghetto
Baby I’m nasty Nas I just had to meet you
Let’s wash that back with a glass of screaming eagle
Painting pictures, writing my illest rhymes on a easel
Ladies on checking asking when Imma see you
Miami penthouse suite crazy with the sea view
Still keep it hood like the streets I used to creep through
QB

[Chorus x4: Nelly Furtado]
Baby I could give you something
Baby I could give you something
Baby I could give you something
I know how to make something out of nothing

[Outro: Nelly Furtado]
Something, something...
