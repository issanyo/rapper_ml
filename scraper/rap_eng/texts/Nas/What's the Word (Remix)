[Verse 1: Joe Fox]
All the kids around my way
You bought that flake, get through the day
And I'm inside just countin' blues
Hiding from the TV news
Sex and drugs is all my pleasure
In this little life of leisure
A pretty girl, she don't believe
Anything she hears or sees

[Chorus: Joe Fox]
Well, what's the word on the street?
What's the word on the street?
What's the word I need to tell myself
'Cause all the pills, they just ain't helpin' me
I can't think or see

[Verse 2: Joe Fox]
Soon in love we all succumb
You get nine lives and then you're done
But here they comes, your politician
Stage magician, little difference

[Chorus: Joe Fox]
Well, what's the word on the street?
What's the word on the street?
I said, what's the word I need to tell myself
'Cause all these pills, they just ain't helpin' me

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, what's your goals? What's the price of your soul?
Perfections, imperfections, what a life to behold
No textin' on intersections, keep your eyes on the road
Don't be caught in the fast lane driving slow
Yo, I am rock 'n roll with bebop, the rebirth of Leopold Stokowski
I be the first to rework verses
So that they sound profoundly loud in the cathedral
I'm surrounded by evil; they brutalize unarmed people
Everybody got this, everybody got that
Everybody's rich, everybody actin' like they pockets is fat
Copy this and copy that
They probably diss somebody in the comments
You get bodied over that, now they call you the city's finest
We celebrate our killers, lovin' they rep
And not enough graduates get respect
I know it's real, it's crazy out here, not safe
Yo, the Draco will clear the block; what's an op?
Why all the hate, y'all?

[Chorus: Joe Fox]
What's the word on the street?
Ah tell me, what's the word on the street?
What's the word I need to tell myself
'Cause all these pills, they just ain't helpin' me
I can't fight the sea
What's the word I need to tell myself
All these pills, they just ain't helpin' me
