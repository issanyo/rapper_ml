[Intro: Raye]
Oh yeah-yeah
Oh-na-na-na, uhm

[Raye]
Concrete bricks, bullet proof vests
I'm proud of these walls that I built to defend
And protect this bold heart
This bold heart
But the way you marched into my home
Not few, big army
With the weapon on your arm
Yes, you struck straight with your cold heart
Your cold heart

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm like Nat, I'm like Nat
I'm a man of God but where is Christ at?
And even though my name is Nas I am like Nat
Is this me declaring war? White flags
I now know why I was even born
To strike back
A full moon up in the sky, that's a sign that
It's time to get my liberation, the perfect configuration
It's the birth of a nation, midwife black
Mother father, caucasian
My blood Indian, native
So now I'm contemplating being like Nat
'Bout to show you what I'm made of
I'm what racists are afraid of
No mule and the 40 acres
And despite that
Watch out for the traitors
When they say make America great again, do they mean make us all slaves again?
Don't be sidetracked

[Hook: Raye]
Is this you declaring war?
No, we will never wave the white flag, the white flag
So you think I'm gonna run now?
No, the time has come to fight back, to fight back
This is me declaring war
This is me declaring war, war
This is me declaring war, war

[Verse 2: Nas]
Don't want to be a victim no more
Depicted as a criminal, especially when you're poor
Why doesn't the government order capital punishment
To officers
Who racial profile and put slugs in us
Makes me think they want us extinct
On the brink of insanity
We screaming for justice, they sending tanks, the man in me
Demand we protect the family, anarchy
Ku-Klux-Klan and him demanding he damage me
So my fantasy is every single one of us
Come against the evil divide of people, it's common sense
The fury, I hope the whole world hear me
No justice, so I became a revolutionary
No matter if you're red, white, black
If you want freedom then we're all like Nat

[Hook: Raye]
Is this you declaring war?
No, we will never wave the white flag, the white flag
So you think I'm gonna run now?
No, the time has come to fight back, to fight back
This is me declaring war
This is me declaring war, war
This is me declaring war, war

[Outro]
Dear America, it's time for a better America
There's a little Nat Turner in every one of us
No matter if you're red, white, black
If you want freedom then we're all like Nat
War, war (war), war, war
Declare war
It's time
Let the spirit of Nat Turner live forever
