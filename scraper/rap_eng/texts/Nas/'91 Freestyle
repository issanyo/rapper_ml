Yo, this is Nas, the rebel to America
I load the clips 'til my lips are crass, cracked
Like a vet buggin' out from flashbacks
My raps, I shoot at your skull and leave ya sprung
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns
Paragraph wizard makin' mics malfunction
I blow the fuse with the style I choose
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voice-box locks and excels like a rocket
Nas assassinates the Pope with a scope
I mutilate mics 'til my voice-box is broke
Try to battle me and gasp for breath
Words I speak is a step beyond death
A rappin' Charles Manson, I'm just that odd
I'm so strong, long enough to box with God
I throw a pitch at your brain so try and catch it
My thought are bugged
My brains should be put in a straitjacket
I'm nastier than cannibalism
I'm as sharp as a shank in prison, thoughts abrupt, risen
My rap is a ritual of Satan
Though I'm not demonic, my voice is electronic
My brain is deranged
In a metamorphic change, my sound waves are strange
Many say that I'm propelled to Hell
But I met the Devil and wrecked his brain cell
Police murderer, I love to kill a black cop
Nasty Nas is as deadly as a crack spot
And smoke a mic like a fiend
I use a TEC 9 like I was ???????
I go on till the break of dawn
Breakin' raps in half, my word is bond
It's like that and, uh, I go on and on
Akinyele, rock the mic till the mic is torn
