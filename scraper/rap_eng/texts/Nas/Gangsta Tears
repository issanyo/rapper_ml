[Hook x2]
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only a few can feel my pain
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if I could show you
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if you was in this game
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) You'd feel the whirlwind blow you

[Verse 1]
My daily dose is ferocious
I smoke dope, just as strong as opium
Hopin I'm close to just breakin frustration;
Speakin on podiums
Facin this cold world head-on, dead on arrivals
Young black, poor education guns crack
The gang violence done that
Nighttime, the guns blow, streets got snitches
Dealers, bitches, killers and blunt smoke, clubs open
Benzes, Jeeps, dubs pokin out tires
Thugs with heat, pay security, to let them slide in
Huh, I'm at the corner driftin, sippin, Cognac
To' back, know dat soldiers is packin no secret
Though I'm broken hearted women done left me hopeless in darkness
Smokin, driftin in sickness, stand by oceans watch the sun glisten
I'm soul-searchin, I'm soul-hurtin
What happens when money don't make you happy
I wish this on no person
Ate at the classy places, made all my fashion statements
I got no friends I'm lonely, don't want no pity save it

[Verse 2]
Yo, ride in the nighttime, I'm high, got on my flight suit
Hood with the Nike sign, dark colors on
Pull up the block my brother's on
I hug him and we blow trees (sup nigga?) Scopin for police
Guns on our hip, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks (right here)
We left the drug game alone
Brothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home
What could you tell us?
At funerals my eyes swell up (damn)
Look at my dog lay in the casket
Twin shotgun barrels had blasted
And rest in peace Barkin, is all I could whisper
As I paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin
It's part of God's plan, but why so many niggas have to die?
It's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by
Bandana covers my eye, I'm scopin through the room
I see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons
And yet I feel responsible when my nigga's pronounced dead
Inside the hospital, I wish there's somethin I could do, but..
