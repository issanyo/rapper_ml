Yo Loose That Crank
Feeling Like Another Time
Just Can Speak (Ya)
I've Knowing (Why Is So Hard)
To Loose It Up Again And Again (Now Lets Hit It!)

[Verse: Case]
Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Yo Nas
Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Man Its To Long
Listen For Yourself (Uh Huh) Not Another Time
Just Aspect What U Know U Can Try It Together
Never The Less To Just Be Everything
Na Na Na
Na Na Na
Yo Na Na Na

[Chrous: Cordell] (Nas)
Crazy Boys (Yo)
Loose It Up Over Yourself (Yo)
Just Don't Let It Be The Same (Around Like This)
C'mon This Ain't No Time Wii Or Playing Games (Yo)
I've Just Loose (It) (Up) Yo (Loose It Up)
