[Intro]
Keep it raw for ya. No doubt PR. Check it

[Verse 1]
Play your position focus on life, see what you're missing
Reality, the tale or the caliber
.45-Nickel-9. check the calender
'97m deep algebra, black plaga
Rule the world high, ___
With my gangster for single years
And rap world emulates my life for years
Autobiography a part of me
Portaits of the ill shit inside of me
Magnetic, jigged up to my faded wig
Any position I'm in, I find a way to live
Out of state, on the block or behind metal gate
Yo, this heavyweight got cheddar to make
Smack your head off, click wildling, push through
Puerto rock warriors too you through
The drama
Escobar or Pablo, Miliano, Pabo; take the world pronto
Word to mine, genuine, Se√±or Juan at your table
Poision you, mad fatal
Just the way it is, when you let the hood raise you
Never let them hoes play you
Mental, smart, strong and stable
