Yo true story, I met this girl back in 2010
Saw her on the street, asked for a cig & that’s how the story would begin
Yo every now & then; wed bump into each other
Yea she was hot, justa couple years younger, so I hada play it cool like it wasn’t into her
But she saw past that, mami had a nice rack, nice tits & a fat ass
So I complemented her on that;
She was more like, u know where I can get a dub sack
I thought ait, she like to smoke that’s what im talkin about
She showed me some doe, so now we walkin around
Made a couple calls, then we started headed downtown
Made a little bit chit chat, about this that;
She say she got a rought past; Im saying I can relate back
Moving on; playing with the phone; playing a couple songs
She like that’s my jam, im thinkin like it won't be long
Yea that kinda sounded wrong
But if you was lookin at what I was lookin at, you be in a hurry too
She in short shorts, tank top, burbrry blue
Hmm, dam wish I could see through
Now we burnin, she pop the question, you wanna be my boo?
Im thinkin, im lookin at her n she lookin at you
So yo, what you gunna do
What you gunna tell her fool?

Son, it went from days to weeks, to several months
I had this bad feeling in my stomach sometimes like I always does
That some bad shit would happen but it didn’t, never once
Until that one day before the start of summer
See I was trying really hard to stay outta the gutter
She was into who knows this, that, and the other
That’s why it hurt so much what happened next cuz I really loved her
Started out with some drugs, then moved on to stealin
When i asked her why, she didn’t have a reason
Couldn’t say  how she was feelin;
Just kept on some shit about her leavin
So it went from being laughing n smiling
To tellin baby  to calm down, n stop wildin
But she didn’t, ran off n got sent to the island

I guess that’s how she …

Verse 2

Son, I know bitches that get pregnant just for the hell of it
Mami around the way was 6 months & she still sellin shit
Im like what about the kid, she like that irrelevant
Marinie husband not around, only married for the benefits
That’s a fuckin degenerate, but looks whos talkin
The king straight outta new York, but not Christopher walken
Theres hasn’t been a poker game around I havnt bought in
Want me to go in, ait?
