"Fear Of The Black Man"

The Fear [x2] Of A Black Man Dick The Worlds Greatest Fear

[Verse 1:]
Scoopin' Dee Lop Street Hop Dats All We Do Guess What America We Love You Step Up West Africa We Love You
Guess What UK We Love Ya We Need You We Singin' Like Ms.Makeba Not Imperious Lyricist But At The Same Time
Nas Is Impenetrable A  Menace To Fools The description of who?   I Resent That A Prince Hat Is My Crown
My Throne Used To Belong To Where That North Korean Kim Used To Sit At They Think  A Chimps  A Black Mans Ancestor
I Think A Pimps A Black Mans Ancestor Just Around The Paragraph In The Corner Of My Next Word Right Next To The World Greatest Fear
The Fear Of The African Black Mans Penis Is (??) Sara Beth Married Jesse Lee Proud Man He Was Mother  Like Aunt Jemima
Black Blue Color Skin A Softness Unmatched By Anyone Stern With Her  Words Dats Mother Black Mother Love Her Son Jesse
Dat Old Jesse is A Trip At The Factory Told The Boss Man That He Quit He Loved His Cigarettes His Beer And Sara Beth Married Less Than A Month
After They Met Sare Beth Was After The Sex Cute White Darling Pretty Angel From The Heaven She Fallen Such A Perfect Match
They Both Human They Both Knew When They Got Together Be A Bunch  Of Eye Screwin' Whole Bunch Of How Dare You Looks From The Whites At The Negro
Black Chicks Have Fits At Her  And Mandingo Shes So Liberal Screams Out In Ecstacy Cause Sexually She Gotta Have A Staff of Jesse Lee

[Chorus:]
The Fear Of The Black Man's Penis (Dey Tryin' To Give It Aids, They Try To Give It Aids)
The Fear Of The Black Man's Dick (They Lie Screamin Rape, They Lie Screamin Rape)
The Fear Of The Black Man's Penis (Can't Hide It's In Your Face, America it's  In Your Face)
The Fear Of The Black Man's Dick (Father Of The Place, All The Ladies Love The Taste Of Tha Nigga)

[Verse 2:]
They Used To Barb-a-que Blacks Cut Off They Genitalia Killin' Off The Aborigines In Austrailia Coldest Shit I'm Tryin' To Tell Ya
Daddies Told His Daughter Stay Away From The Bucks They Just Want To Impale Ya Cause She Heard About What The Myth Is About Our Big Heavy Equipment
That Some Sisters Might Dismiss It HA HA Yeah Right Your Right She Probably Ain't Get A Call The Other Night So Fathers You Should Be Scared
Cuz Your Little Girl Is Bangin' Down The Door Of My Bedroom She Tryin' To Get Inside of My  Fruit Of The Looms She Hopes To Have My Heirlooms  Passin' Down My Grandfather's Crown Jewels
Cause If We Get Around The World Turns Brown It's A Fact They Want A Thug In Em' Guess How Many Presidents Had Some Black Blood In Em' And This Nation Is A Vast Nation
So Wut Was Your Fixation With Castration Color Shouldn't Matter Wit Relations Color Shouldn't Matter Wit Life & Love Cause Color Never Matters Under The Covers When The Lights Are Off

[Chorus:]
The Fear Of The Black Man's Penis (Dey Tryin' To Give It Aids, They Try To Give It Aids)
The Fear Of The Black Man's Dick (They Lie Screamin Rape, They Lie Screamin Rape)
The Fear Of The Black Mans Penis (Can't Hide It's In Your Face, America it's  In Your Face)
The Fear Of The Black Man's Dick (Father Of The Place, All The Ladies Love The Taste Of Tha Nigga)
