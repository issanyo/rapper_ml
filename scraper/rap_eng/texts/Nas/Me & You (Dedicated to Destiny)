[Intro]
I'd like to dedicate this one here, to my star
Someone I cherish, she loves me unconditionally
No matter what, our love will always be here for you baby
Yeah
So from God, he gave me this gift, you (ha ha)
And I give you this, the world (If I had it all)

[Hook]
(If I had it all) daddy's little girl I would give you the world
Little girl I'd give you the world (If I had it all)
Yeah, just me and my little one
Just me and my little one (If I had it all)
I'd give you the world

[Verse 1]
Even though we don't live in the same home
And I mightta miss your graduation
And no matter how many miles I'm away from you
You know that I love you
Hear daddy on every station
Thinking, I'm loving my occupation
I know I got you home waitin', Desy
I do it all for you (if I had it all)

[Hook]
(If I had it all) daddy's little girl I would give you the world
Little girl I'd give you the world (If I had it all)
Yeah, just me and my little one
Just me and my little one (If I had it all)
I'd give you the world

[Verse 2]
Even though you'll be grown soon
You gotta stand on your two
Please listen what daddy told you
I know you think that I'm old school
You'll see that I was right soon
One day, you will meet the right groom
And then, you will see your life bloom
And then you'll know what's right for you (If I had it all)

[Hook]
(If I had it all) daddy's little girl I would give you the world
Little girl I'd give you the world (If I had it all)
Yeah, just me and my little one
Just me and my little one (If I had it all)
I'd give you the world

[Verse 3]
Respect your mom, no one will replace her
She's the one who went through the labour (If I had it all)
But you don't owe her no favours
But her respect is due
See, daddy just wanna show you (If I had it all)
All the heartache I go through (If I had it all)
It's for you

[Outro]
If this world were mine, I'd give it all to you (If I had it all)
Yeah, (If I had it all)
It's your world baby girl
Yeah!
Yeah, just me and my little one (If I had it all)
Just me and my little one (If I had it all)

(If I had it all)
(If I had it all)
