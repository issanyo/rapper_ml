Frank Nitti it's been a long time since we've been...
Since we've talked (Yo, it's what it's all about huh?)
We need to talk about these... these guys
They're fronting, they're fucking up!

[AZ (Nas)]
A travel for forty days and forty nights from A to Z
And crushed cash flows and hoes
Owes uncut and froze
Just to find out those chose to be amongst a nigga was foes
Fish market ass, disrespectful, self-centred individuals (yes!)
Wanna be willies, but yet petty larceny criminals (yeah son!)
Ya'll want it all? Then lets go get it and commit it
Lets think Brink's, extortion from the Arabs to the Chinks (yes!)
Before I sink, its either all or nothing, no fronting
Fuck the panic button son
Doe or Die (Doe or Die kid!)
Doe or Die (Doe or Die kid!)
Word to moms Doe or Die (What? Doe or Die kid!)
Yo, it's what it's all about huh? (yeah, Doe or Die kid!)
Yo, it's what it's all about (fucking Doe or Die kid!)
