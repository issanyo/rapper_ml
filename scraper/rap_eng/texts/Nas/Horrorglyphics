[Nas]:
Yo I'm rich, black
The 6, the Lac
The Phantom, the strap, stay on my lap
I'm a hustler, ganja puffer, iron tucker
I get ripped in the afternoon before kids get out of school
They say, "Nas, they fucked up."
I'm up early, acting a fool
Driving D.C. with drive-bys on Lincoln's statue
Hire my meetings
Leave the weed sit in the board rooms
Stick up men in black fishermen hats is my goons

[Sha Stimuli]:
I'm stronger than typhoons
Get your hands up like high noon
Rap like I'm ready to die soon
But I don't advise you to try duke
Look at how I move
I spit shit sicker than swine flu
Since I was 5"2', the 2-5 side on my side, true
Story, if it's war I will find you
I gotta remind you, you can wind up with peoples behind you
They catch you copping extra ketchup right at the drive-thru
Nas!

[Nas]:
It's cool to love to win but it's better to hate to lose
There's only one me, 100,000 yous
You lose money chasing women, never lose women chasing money
Niggas is paid, plus the wolves is hungry
Morgues full of dead niggas who was taking money
Morgues full of niggas with the last shit they ate in they stomach
Spinach and steak
Gortex boot prints still in they face
It's still in they space when you visit his wake

[Sha Stimuli]:
This ain't a debate
But we forth and back like some soldier's strapped
Set to take you off the map
This is more talk than rap
I'm in the almanac for killing and assaulting tracks
Caught some flack for mimicking Jesus
Guess I was wrong for that

[Nas]:
Rare nigga, I'ma wonder
Your best success is my worst blunder
Feds tapped the number
Jewelry Jacqueline Onassis could appreciate
We two alleviate the pain, Eddie Cane
Richard Fire, pinky rings

[Sha Stimuli]:
The Five Heartbeats in one heart
Like I got the pain of Donald
Peeping his girl and his brother, standing in rain
I don't do it for the fame
I don't do it for the game
I do it, just for the music and you and I are the same
Got a trailer load of top models
I don't got to thank 'em
Shabba Ranks mixed with Tyra Banks
Give a lot of thanks, damn
I started slow now my boot is on the gas
Any problems, I'm a trucker yo, I shoot before I pass, get it?

[Nas]:
Watch your conduct nigga
Throw parties for my nigga's that living
You guessed it
Models, y'all keep 'em if they anorexic
Love 'em but can't trust 'em
Hate 'em but won't bust 'em
Cake in his savings, spinning, wasting is like a custom

[Sha Stimuli]:
I wonder why they got my people's as puppets
Doing records with no message, we jiving and shucking
And the children get affected, they dying for nothing
I made a promise dawg, that I'll give them something
I can't lose

[Nas]:
Tats of horrorglyphics
Lipstick on a collar
I got more to lose than you do, but I'm a rider
When did the rules change?
Y'all living trendy on pennies
Meeting deadlines with ease, no gain
You fire, I'm butane
Favorite Tims, ostrich belts
These be the times that I surprise myself
My niggas looking like black crows at packed shows
The Don boy stay pristine like I'm still 17

[Sha Stimuli]:
Still, quest for cream
Still stay high as mezzanines
Used to smoke the evergreen
Used to guzzle Hennessy
Used to have empathy
Now all I got is memories
And they don't live like people do
Guns don't kill, people do
Follow me, I'll see you through
God Son, give me your sins
Damn those comparisons, I did it again
I'm a Beast when I speak
I got blue fur
Brink rhyming this way, it's best to just U-Turn
I'm making up new words
I Stimulize, ladies rip the package
The greatest of the rappers, we don't play 'em, we don't practice
Upfront money, never pay me on the back end
Feds Savion Tapping my phone, leave me alone
I'm shy/sha, Stimuli
How you gonna criticize?
Stupid I epitomize what it is to live and die
And come back and live again
Told you I can ?
Turn 'em into blessings
I'm the motherfucking freshest
