[Verse 1: K'La]
Promise to give, Promise to love
But you broke up promises
Just like you broke my trust
Never again,I won’t hurt again
I promised myself never to love another man

[Hook: K'La]
You promised you'd love me, love me, love me
You promised you’d stay, you’d stay
But I don’t feel the same
You’re the one to blame
Why I act this way
You’re the one to blame
Why I think this way
You’re the one to blame
Blame,blame,blame
You’re the one to blame
Blame,blame,blame

[Verse 2: K'La]
Who would’ve tought, I’d end up this way
Stepping on hearts and throwing love away
But you can’t hate the player you gotta hate the game
And I know it hurts to see the monster that you made

[Hook: K'La]

[Verse 3: Nas]
Our face cold, with great shoulders by the waist I hold her
Her only mistake is I caught her rocking takeover
She cooks steak I’m not a carnivore it’d be kind of raw
But the wine is fine,I’m mature and be times that’s all woman
Have better talks my teenage daughter
Then we have and you a grown woman
So I be vague when I answer questions
About my life or hustlin’, I know you used to first dates
But dudes be all the fun and had this,they want that
Did time and fucked that, beat this they know people
Connections and all that
You tied up but let’s try intellectual higher subject
Like metaphysics or the science of it
That is corny also, let’s talk about you being my lawful
But nah, not just yet, maybe later we just met
But for now, I need to keep you around
‘Cause this the most perfect all I found in a while

[Hook: K'La]
