[Verse 1: Nas]
Finished up my new album, single 'bout to be droppin'
Last album on Def Jam and now I got so many options
Maybe I go to Raton, out in a Rollie on arm, couple cigars
They be like aren't you Nas ah man, I just say nah, they say I know you a star
They say I know who you are, but I'm really late night in the stu'
Got a call from my dog Q, for the G-Mix now let's groove
Pussy stock going up, I think it's all of these checks
I think it's cause you love yourself a smooth thug dude from the 'jects
When Belly's on TV the only time that I receive your texts
Shit I must be poppin', got so many options
Tall models, short models, big girls to coke bottles
Church girls to bad bitches, I'm interviewing, holla

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid (Nas)]
(I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby)
But this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
You need a real nigga, shorty so come in, throw that pussy, shorty
See I think you and me can make it, this little verse to get you naked
See, your heart ain't meant for breaking, Cupid's never been mistaken
See, I been caught up in the moment, shit, my type ain't quite her type
But now this gangsta nigga on it, she can twist my weed and hit the 'yac
I can hit your type without the hat, put that pussy on the map
I see qualities in a bad girl, I know that ass you got
Come with attitude and your swag, girl, you ain't wrong, girl
Just when that door knock lose your thong, girl
Cause you girl, cause you girl, girl, cause you girl, girl

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Throw a loc your pussy, girl, you knowing that your nigga faded
Can I hit that pussy way I wanna while this record playing?
Put my tongue in different places, play a game of Operation
Na-na-na, la-la, la-la, you get what I'm saying
No metaphors, nothing like that
I'm keeping it straight to the point with you
I'mma put this dick up all in-side-of-you

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
