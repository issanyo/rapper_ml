[Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
This love is so dangerous
But I kind of like the thrill
It's like a sugar rush
It's all in the way you make me feel
I didn't see you coming, but you broke me down
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos
One smile, and oh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
I gotta admit you're fly
And I love it how you talk, babe
Getting all in my mind
Running it like a field play
I didn't see you coming
But you broke me down
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Don't you walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos, and

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do
You ain't no ordinary boy
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
I, deep down know I should be good
I ain't blind, you're the kind of guy
That always got all these girls running after you
Do I entertain or play with you? Or just be cool?
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos
One smile, and oh
Don't sleep, I think I'ma burn too fast
So close, wrapped up in the heat of love
I'm having fantasies of how it's gonna be
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos, still

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do
You ain't no ordinary boy
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux

[Verse 4: Nas]
Yo, got Henny in the cup, Jenny knows what's up
She with a real one, not pretending to be tough
Got three cases, might have a warrant I don't know about
Beef I don't know about, weed I can't go without
My money used to pile up every beginning of the month
Unconditional love, in the beginning it was lust
Hustler, shooter, was a dealer on the block
Now my future's on top, no longer dealing with the thots
I don't go nowhere without the handle
Like I heard Lil' Boosie was out in Louisiana
Got friends in the feds, some dead over drugs
Fucking with me is high-risk but she still in love (We in love, baby)
Benny Medina might wanna pay me to leave ya
I'm bad for your image, the ghetto menacing diva
'Cause some say Nas is trouble
We all in, just ignore them nice guys is boring, I got you

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do
You ain't no ordinary boy
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
