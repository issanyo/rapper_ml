*Car honk*

[Verse One: Nas]
Some girls lie a lot
They could be fly or not
Actresses cry a lot
Their girlfriends spy a lot
They could shake your hand, girl
Then they take your man, girl
The hood not knowin'
We had somethin' good goin'
Now these shorties after me
Cause they saw us happy
And that you bagged me
Now they wishin' that they had me
So watch who you hang with
And who you clang with
You know these bitches ain't shit
They hopin' to bank chips
With a baller - and after she done laid in his bed
He never call her - he gamed her, then he left her for dead
Birds of a feather flock together
But chickens don't fly, they eat their own shit and die
Don't be affiliated, the relationship we had, I tried to imitate it
With somebody new, cause our love just disintegrated
I paid for ice to spoil
So I know best it's gonna take a good man to wife LeToya

[Verse Two: LeToya]
Hello baby, as I was walkin' by
Hesitated and then I realized
'There go David'
I was surprised to see you
And I asked - 'Do you remember me?'
Boy I'm so elated to run into you here
Shadow faded with diamonds in your ears
The memories that go, I don't wanna let go
Hear you say you got a girlfriend, but I know

[Chorus: LeToya]
She don't even touch you like this (no)
She don't even kiss you like this (Oh noooo)
She don't even treat you like I do (like I do)
Boy you know that (boy you know that)
She don't even touch you like this (ooooohh)
She don't even kiss you like this (ooh nooo)
She don't even treat you like I do

[Verse Three: LeToya]
Ooh, I see us makin' plans
Me and you, forget your circumstance
Don't be actin' like me and you don't go way back
Late night tippin' in yo Cadillac
See I'm no psychic, but I can understand
She's a sidekick, but I know all your fantasies
She can't do it to you like I used to
And you know that I know
That she can't do you like I do, whoa

[Chorus: LeToya]
She don't even touch you like this
She don't even kiss you like this (Ooooh)
She don't even treat you like I do (like I do)
Boy you know that (boy you know that)
She don't even touch you like this (she can kiss you.. no-no)
She don't even kiss you like this (she can treat you.. no-no)
She don't even treat you like I do (whoooaa)

[Verse Four: LeToya]
Look at me and tell me you ain't feelin' me
Boy you know that I'm the one you need
(oh-oh-oh)
She's a waste of time, I can love you riigghhhtt
(Boy you know that)
I already know you want it personal
So there ain't no need to take it slow
(oh-oh-oh, you know)
You know your best is your first
So tell me why you're with her

[Chorus: LeToya]
She don't even touch you like this (whooaa)
She don't even kiss you like this (she can neither kiss you baby)
She don't even treat you like I do (like I do)
Boy you know that (boy you know that)
She don't even touch you like this (she don't even)
She don't even kiss you like this (she don't even)
She don't even treat you like I do
(she don't even touch you like I do now, boy you know that)
