Whoa, love is all we need
Cause everybody needs love

Love is all we need
To make everything complete
If we try to live together and be happy
You and me are one and we've only just begun
So let's make a new beginning have some fun

1-Love is all we need, to make everything complete
All we need is L-O-V-E, love is all we need
Cause to love you would mean everything
Everybody needs love

Dealing with tough times seems to always blow my mind
But I know where my heart is so I am fine, I'm fine
If we remain friends it would never ever end
On this love I give to you, you can depend
(repeat 1)

Love is all we need to make every little thing complete
Yeah, yeah, oh if you would trust in me
I would let you know that I love you, that I love you
Oh, Lord, don't ever leave me...
Love is all we need, yeah, yeah, yeah

Feel this hit
Bangin' in your residential district
Presidential chipped out, canary rock sizzlin'
Mary's hop hop, crisp shorty got this
Fly angel
My dreams of a queen came true
In this land that's dark
If you my man and you my heart
I blast for you
Need bail? Put up the cash for you
Girls who mad loyal, die for you
Leave them if they acting too fly for you
All up in yo' mix then in somebody else six
Quick to put your name in some murder one shit
I'm not the one cheatin' on you, or beatin' on you
Cause I'm laid back you thought that I was sleeping on you?
Real love make a ill thug feel bug
Nas analyze, are you trustworthy by the looks in your eyes?
Stay with me, be my dog like Dollar and Richie
She convinced me
All we really need is love, strictly

Love is all we need to make everything complete
I want to be happy yeah, want to be happy

Love is all we need, and I know that it can be done
If we can love, if we can love, everybody needs love
