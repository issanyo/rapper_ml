[Intro]
We ugh, All Star

[Verse 1: Nas]
High Cinderella, loafers glass
Fold up cash
You ain't heard this soldier's half
You speaking hog wash
Silly shit
Hold the dash, I got that live spark
Philly lit, smoker's jacket on
Son of a capricorn, my dads a don
What you think that he spawned?
A slacker? Nah
A packer? Nah
My jibber-jabber lacks the swine
Smack your moms relaxed and calm
Then mack your mom
Cause you don't know how to act round Nas
You flash round Nas
Like a test you gotta pass round Nas
Ladies spread they ass like a wide mouth bass
Just to get a glance from Nas
They dance round Nas
Chance with Nas
While the music amplifies
Hundred foot yacht in Cancun high
You sweat from a rhinoceros nuts
Baboons behind
I'm fly with my design
I'm fly with mine y'all

[Hook: Pream-O]
Politickan, we made it without a pot to piss in
Opposition is nothin' more than your competition
My commission is gettin' figures in my position
Hustle is my religion, hustle is my religion
Politickan, we made it without a pot to piss in
Opposition is nothin' more than your competition
My commission is gettin' figures in my position
Hustle is my religion, hustle is my religion

[Verse 2: Pream-O]
Yo from the womb to the tomb, you can bet that shit
Any struggle I was facin', had to dead that shit
I went to Queens for the work, to finesse that shit
On my life, we dropped the price, we could stretch that shit
We in the field in New York tryna jet that shit
We giants, you smokin' nicks, where'd you get that shit?
They sick, the dope flip, from me blessin' y'all, Escobar
Got me street dreamin' upper echelon, next in line
Better time work than to waste on shit
My time work, savin' money that you waste on chicks
Straight on flips, got me gettin' straight on chips
I'm focused in and movin' special like the 8 on hip
Wait on shit, no I'ma get it now
That's word to God's Son nigga, I'ma put it down
My grind ain't been the same since the day I seen a thou
Now I'm lookin' at a hundred, ain't been hurtin' in a while
Wicked's how I'm livin'
Criminal
Online flow, digital
I go through hell so it's Heaven that I get my child
It's been a while since the focus wasn't money piles
Now these young thugs runnin' around lookin' funny style
I got a dummy style, stupid good flow
I don't trust too many niggas, I'ma (?) for sure
I roof in the door like Nino with the snipers
Money rollin' up like a sour with the lighters
First class seats takin' trips, need a cypher
Smilin' cause the white swine culture don't like us
Hard like Rykers
Mental penitentiaries, movin' like a lifer
Look what ghettos did to me
Paintin' pictures with me, leave Picasso with the brush
Bein' famous sounds good but to make it is a must
I'd rather die a getter way before I hit the dust
Cause I grew up in some hoods that the tourists wouldn't touch
Nigga trust

[Hook: Pream-O]
Politickan, we made it without a pot to piss in
Opposition is nothin' more than your competition
My commission is gettin' figures in my position
Hustle is my religion, hustle is my religion
Politickan, we made it without a pot to piss in
Opposition is nothin' more than your competition
My commission is gettin' figures in my position
Hustle is my religion, hustle is my religion

[Hook: Pream-O]
Politickan, we made it without a pot to piss in
Opposition is nothin' more than your competition
My commission is gettin' figures in my position
Hustle is my religion, hustle is my religion
Politickan, we made it without a pot to piss in
Opposition is nothin' more than your competition
My commission is gettin' figures in my position
Hustle is my religion, hustle is my religion
