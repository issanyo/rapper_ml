[Verse 1 - Nas]
If Macy's don't have it
A hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around
Or I'm wasting fabric
I don't feel great until my plushest pieces
Cause you to suck your teeth
Some mean-mugging on my clean thugging mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry writing Russian
Ice disgusting. I started bling
How could you question my direction?
I'm king, I'm cultured, not just cause of
The foreign movie posters, the frames
Starring French names, look closer
? to the worm food
I despise and watch fake wise guys who turn stool
And speak highly of late made guys who once ruled
Hard-bottomed shoes, chauffeurs flaunt ambrosia
My baby moms wrote a book that couldn't harm a soldier
Muhammad Ali hobbies, no pilates, jogging, jumping rope
Til my body cut up like a bag of dope
And hope I die ?

[Hook - Nas]
Worked too hard, stayed up too many nights
If I'm wrong for being me, I don't wanna be right
Nah! No not never, no not ever
I don't wanna be right, hood star, we are

[Verse 2 - Nas]
Diggi-diggi-dignitaries, Carhart congress
Fitted hat high rank officials
World Bank like Rothschilds
Take the wool from over your eyes
Who conspired to deceive you and I
It's easier for a man to believe a big lie
Than a small truth. Money's not evil
It's the love of money that's the root
Not a luxury car worshipper, but I purchase
Particular vehicles, so me and my dudes, we can cruise
Upsetting policia They study my natural sleepy eye
To see if I'm high. I got my piece of the pie
My 40 acres is my 40 karats on my piece, that's fly
Carti bracelet, you talk that talk and walk that walk
You wouldn't understand our thoughts
How many black leaders are bought
Why the fuck you care if I rap about
How much my sneakers cost? I'mma floss

[Hook - Nas]
Worked too hard, stayed up too many nights
If I'm wrong for being me, I don't wanna be right
Nah! No not never, no not ever
I don't wanna be right, hood star, we are
