[Hook x2]
Your mouth got you in it your ass can’t get you out
Next time hold your tongue, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun
Know when you don't want war with no one
When the ... niggas after you where you gonna run
You mouth got in it your ass can’t get you out
Next time hold your tounge, you wouldn’t have to hold your gun
Know when you don't want it with no one
... niggas now are after you and here they come

[Verse 1]
This nigga thinkin that everybody puss til he got his shit push
Lot of shit poppin, got him all swiss cheesed up
He fell to his knees and wished he never released words from outta his mouth bout the next man's Gs
Telling me that he was heavenly involved to rob
Any nigga who scared to murder who had cash
Didn't deserve the convertible cars, sipping bourbon at bars
He feel if they ain't real he should get stuck, him and his peoples
You must be sniffing that diesel
Cause if that nigga knew you was scheming he would just leave you in pieces
Plus he's a friend of ours, we got our Benz's that power
Motor cars hung on the wire, left summers puff party
Plus you don’t get enough really never meant ..laugh and threat
.. That they wouldn’t budge they play the ..

[Verse 2]
These niggas live after death before ...
I got you we smoke the same weed, same cars we drive
Knew two of these dudes got into murder shit just last year
I start fuck with them thinking make me lose my career
We still touch though its just dough
I make some songs that ... on they dirty money just smell wrong
But I don't knock you because we come from the same upbringing
I came up slinging, the same way they came up slinging
One thing I learn though, still judge niggas by it
Say alot about men who contend but can't be quiet
The school from which I learn is the street of old
Fuck fools they talk to worm in six feet hole
Be telling niggas what I'm eatin, what I’m holding, its sickening
Don't be conerned with what I'm eating, cause what I eat you ain't shittin
These niggas that start beef, they talk like bitches
And I'm the type to give you ...
Yo, black stocking cap on my face pulled down
From behind, all you hear is the gun cock back sound
And now I put it in yo mouth, fuck you were sayin?
Suck on this you trip, try to duck and imma spray ya

[Verse 3]
You make promises that you can keep full of deceit
Street face swallow pride ...talk to you money shit
You wana run with it .. talk about shit
You ain't’ get none of it
You whisper got bitch unless is for the real
Always ..tryin' to ..can’t remember I said ..fire on you ..
If .. run off ‘cause the things gotta
You ain’t get no wings ..but ends
How ... I’m going blow to you I expect to win
