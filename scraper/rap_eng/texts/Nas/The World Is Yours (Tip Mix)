[Intro:]
(Whose world is this?)
La-la-la-la-la
(Whose world is this?)

[Verse 1:]
I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi til I'm charged
Writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme - play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facing
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracing
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cipher complete
Whether cruising in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it; the beats make me falling asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (take money!)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Hook:]
(Whose world is this?)
The world is yours
Disciple of the projects slash verbal murderer
(Whose world is this?)
Yea, the world is yours
To the Philly blunt-heads, crack pumping drug murderers
(Whose world is this?)
The world is yours
To my niggas coming home from lockdown with new plans
(Whose world is this?)
Fuck it, the world is mine, holding the stolen cop's Glock with G notes in my hand

[Verse 2:]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
My insight enlights vision words of wisdom
Niggas pay me in tuition to listen
The murder paragraphs of mysticism
Man plants seeds that bring forth multiple breeds
So many cultures on one planet but one culture's free
Son I need weed to proceed
Change the flow speed
I'm gettin' vexed Giuliani at 666
There's no days for broke days sellin' smoke pays
I tote the chocolate potent Phillies never wrote roach-sprayed
Shit is a hassle, The Bridge is like a haunted Castle
The mic's my religion the system is the devil's lasso
And yo, the trife life is most influential
The colors on mens skin and pens is coincidental
How you livin', large or broker
You wastin' time extortin' papers from smokers
Catchin' court papers gettin' broker

[Hook 2:]
The world is mine
Persona of late Tony Montana, yea gettin' mine
(Whose world is this?)
The whole world is mine, who wanted?
I never fronted, I'm forever blunted, getting lye
Henne up with the lye, never stop, we don't stop the - henne low, puffin' lye ya'll
Don't stop the henne low, we puff the lye, everyday puffin' lye, plus the henne low

[Verse 3:]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps - I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps not eating can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbing bitches like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Ill Will style
Check the gold-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burning dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
Plus the games people play
I check the dames plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today

[Outro:]
(Whose world is this?)
Yea, Wizard, keep that lye in the air, yo
I wanna give a shoutout to the whole fucking Queens
My man Tipster on the boards, keeping it real lord
The Queensbridge nation, get it on
Faking no fucking jacks
Fuck around get your wig pushed back
Big shoutout to my man killa, Ron do is on you
L-A-S is on another murder quest
'94, we out
Keep the lye in the air, Hennessy everywhere
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
Keep the la-la going
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
