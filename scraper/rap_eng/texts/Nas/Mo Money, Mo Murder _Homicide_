[Part 1]

[Intro]
We'd be bigger than the Jews, bigger than the Irish
You can run the whole fucking country!
You could be the next John D. Rockerfeller
Nobody noticed us, nobody gave a shit
But the bigger we get
The more we're taking from other people

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, in a mahogany, black scenery
That was lightnin' and rain drops
I'm tied up in the basement, cocaine spot like Bangkok
I'm blindfold, Vietnam type mind control, this torture
His accent sounds like the rarest culture
Askin' me, my atrophy stabbin' me gradually
Says his attribute was satanic, masonic, ironic
I felt reminded of my fast life ventures and winters
Blinded 'til the flashlight enters

[Verse 2: AZ]
Yo, dunn, before the sun set, call connect, get all the TECs
I'm vexed, this nigga stalled for sex, lost respect, let's off his neck
My caliber got me thinkin' on a higher algebra
See, me, I'm just as foul as ya but you ain't got no style in ya
I'm into bigger cheddar, G's and better, Armarett-ah's
Armani sweaters, plus these crabs could never dead us

[Chorus: AZ]
Mo' money, mo' murder, mo' homicide
You catch that body, nigga, better have that alibi
You never know, it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, (now) watch that suicide
Mo' money, mo' murder, mo' homicide
You catch that body, nigga, better have that alibi
You never know, it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, (now) watch that suicide

[Verse 3: AZ]
Now, government official got you sippin' Cristal in crystal
You fish, you foul, so you fell and took your fam with you
I'm out to get you, guaranteed every shell will hit you
Plus I'm on some shit too, layin' down whosoever witchu
Mafiosa, the New York City 90's era Sosa
AZ, you know my culture, now my wolves is out to ghost ya

[Verse 4: Nas]
Scent of a rose on a graveyard for real now
The stakes is up a half a mil' now
I tried to grab him with his shield down
Four walked in, they're crazy paid up, sharp but straight up
Gators from Barbados, never seen nobody play those
Lay-Low is what they called him, his head baldin'
Sippin' cappuccino, spilled on his silk suits, was scaldin'
Laugh was vulgar, canvas paintings of the Ayatollah
And on his arm, he wore a priceless vulture
Tobacco pipe smoker; Escobar, your life is over
Justify the righteous nova, bullets flew out his right shoulder
Corpse leavin' a foul odor
The Firm Vol. 1 adjourned, bring it to a closure

[Chorus: AZ]
Mo' money, mo' murder, mo' homicide
You catch that body, nigga, better have that alibi
You never know, it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, (now) watch that suicide
Mo' money, mo' murder, mo' homicide
You catch that body, nigga, better have that alibi
You never know, it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, (now) watch that suicide

[Verse 5: Nas]
So now ya rollin' with us like co-defendants, no phony business
So know the difference – from supreme soloists
It's styles ancient as Moses' scriptures
It's Latin Kings, Black Kufis and White Justice amongst us
Crime invades the minds of youngsters
Where it's pitch-black, they can't see you
Godfather 3, four left for dead, in a cathedral

[Verse 6: AZ]
Now you're forced to listen
I got the mind of a grad' from Princeton
Play your position, or soon you'll be lost and missin'
It's far from fiction, my presence is like that of a Christian
With ammunition, puttin' states under submission
Street addiction got me tied in thorough with boroughs
Still in the ghetto, but in the cut where it's mellow
Incognito, on the lee-low, like Carlito
‘Cause we know, niggas don't really want us to see dough
You never know, it might just be yo' time, you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, watch that suicide

[Chorus: AZ]
Mo' money, mo' murder, mo' homicide
You catch that body, nigga, better have that alibi
You never know, it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, (now) watch that suicide
Mo' money, mo' murder, mo' homicide
You catch that body, nigga, better have that alibi
You never know, it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, (now) watch that suicide

[Outro: Nas]
Homicide, mo' homicide
Mo' suicide, mo' homicide

[Part 2]

[Intro]
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…

[Verse: AZ]
All alone in this wilderness, who could figure life as ill as this?
My vision's blurred from guerilla's mist
Gun sprays, strays left a portion of my crew in graves
Niggas that would screw in ways, unknown to these dudes today
Intelligence kept us all away from state evidence
‘Cause it's evident, this world is controlled on dead presidents
Never hesitant, I'm soulless, filled with coldness
Born to uphold this 'til I'm left dead from oldness

[Outro]
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
