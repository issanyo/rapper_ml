[Intro: Keyshia Cole]

You know what I wonder sometimes
Like do you know we far we can go if only you believe in me
Yea imagine that

[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
Did you know that I when I say I told you I loved you loved you
And did you know that I was really sincere when I couldn't go creeping creeping around
And everything that I told you I be for you I could really be for you baby
Jus give me give me give me a chance
Let me show (show you)
How I really feel (feel for you)
You are everything

[Chorus x2]
Yeah
Oh- oh, yeah- yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh she says Nas show me the inside your bens
I'm jus tryna show you trust and the beauty of being friends
They jus wanna love and leave ya cut you then sleaze
Tell the world how they beat ya
I'm tryna show you something deeper
Movie night at the crib double feature
Turn off your phone you can moan
We in the love making marathon
You hit notes you never known
In the streets I need chrome and ammunition
But at home you jus want me to listen
Check it
Your friends is hating cause they feel the dating messing with you concentration
And it kills em I'm your fascination
Picture life as my wife jus think
Full length sable seven carets in your nable
Ballers inside the club try to send you they best
Put tattoos on your chest spelling Nas
Tanning no bikini in the sands of Fiji Miami
In my Lamborghini KC believe

[Verse 3: Keyshia Cole]
[Keyshia Cole:]
That's why you got me saying

[Chorus:]
Oh- oh, yeah- yeah
Oh yeah

Yeah you know all I needed you to do is believe in us
You know what I'm saying
But I guess that's the way love goes
