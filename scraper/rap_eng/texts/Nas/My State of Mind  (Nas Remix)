Wake up in the morning awaiting the day that comes. Just to go to school to see the sluts making lumps sums, seeing freshmen lacing they gum, makes me think "maybe it's just me or everyone's dumb."
[Verse 2- Orion Night]
I'm a fucking government statistic, going ballistic, I feel as if my fortune is nothing but distant, because this bullshit in life is always persistent
[Verse 3- Orion Night]
But then again my minds bad as sin, but more sharp than sliced tin, but more corroded than a rusted than a rusted bin, and don't get me started with the pen
[Verse 4- Orion Night]
Don't let me forget about the majority of two-one-nine bitches, so let me speak in sublime pitches
These bitches think it's good to be naughty, strutting ass and sticking chode in their body, brainwashed by promises made to them for a fucking Bugatti from their pants sagging pants swagging fag boyfriend, saying he makes end, threatening to shoot you with a twelve gauge shotty
Cheezetown
[Verse 5- Orion Night]
Or if you're a poor blight, you might catch a couple-a-youngsters scuffling in a fight, or even shoot you with an air gun when they're out of sight, and they're always riding mopeds when they're high as a kite
Groups of kids trying to make a gang, selling sess, under sight of press, because they heard a track from Wu-Tang
Adults get told this all the time, but they think their white flight town is all so sublime
But really it's a heroin market for whoever you want to  make a dime, and if you pull out the wrong move they'll ring your brain like a wind chime
[Verse 6- Orion Night]
And all the old people freak when they see a poor chump with a pellet lodged in his thigh, the sight makes them want to cry, and the cops don't do anything and don't try
Because they're in the same boat, stealing drugs out of the locker buying themselves a fancy new coat
And there's really no debate, for the mess that they create, but we don't revolt instead we just masturbate, so we shouldn't call it a coffin but a pre-determined fate, but my time's coming late, and i'm going to flip off hells gate
So all in all, its a fare share, for a bold dare
Ya know?
And now some poser prep kids trying to make a drug ring, that keeps the wallet biggity busting and makes the fat bitch sing, they pile upon the Adderal Alto153 and star to fling, and its almost as bad as the sluts and their Saturday flings
My school's a mess, every time I'm in the bathroom snuffs on the floor and kids be selling sess, so what you talking about Mr. principal when you be saying our schools the best?
I get legal flashbacks from back in the day, where I was caught with hydrocodone but not with a jay, I think about it too much n start crackin, how'd I actually do opium and start jacking, and beat myself up for the common sense I was lacking, but I still murder these beats with a passion, I'd go to the counsilers but hey they have no idea what they doin, my ass they're a shoe in, people freak out about these stout lyrics I be brewing
