[Intro: AZ & Nas]
Ayo God, yo meet me at the Deniece Williams concert tonight, man
E'rybody there, Stacy Lattisaw, Teena Marie, e'rybody, man
Yeah yeah no doubt
I'ma bring one of my baddest stallions, man
Hahahaha
You do the same aight?
You know how we play baby, listen
I'm at a car wash right now
But I'ma hit you as soon as I'm right over there
Right in front right? Yeah, okay, aight got you

[Verse 1: AZ & Nas]
Son, who laced you with the ill haircut?
Lenny, he blessed me with the sharp blade, that nigga's paid
He make a pretty penny
Yo, you hurt 'em with the new Prada's
True, check mines they royal blue
My shits is baby blue
They powder blue, yo' shits is hotter
You hotter with them frames on
Nigga you James Bond, and you stay low
Y'know my style bab' bro
Yeah, make dough, manicure, facial, face glow
Fuck it if you say so; I keep it P.I.!
That's how we break hoes
We throwin' ivory dice across the concrete
And of course that don't make him your man because y'all palms meet
We had boxes bumpin' La-Di-Da-Di
Shotties was blastin', pellets jumpin' into everybody
They never got me
Was cool with all the park shooters, sparkin' bazookas
Sharpen your tutors, 'cause we don't pardon the snoozers
Yo son I wouldn't change my life for nothin'
And that ain't like you for frontin'
Who's the nicest? Nuff talkin', light somethin'

[Refrain: AZ and Nas]
Yo we hard hit, just like Camacho and Vargas
Who's the target
Now watch how we close the market
We both hard hit, just like Hagler and Hearns
Add the math, be concerned, if it's beef you burn
Yo it's sorta like, Poitier and Bill Cosby
'Let's Do It Again,' a beautiful blend, let's do it to win
My nigga - my nigga - my niggas - my niggas
My niggas - my niggas - uhh..

[Verse 2: AZ & Nas]
What's today's mathematics?
We had it, we let 'em hold it, we should've sold it
We back at it, we could've grabbed it
But fuck it, just let 'em have it
Al 'Humdulillah
Allahu Akbar, God is the greatest
Planet Mars, we carved in the faces
You couldn't catch us in a car without the bangers
Believe, I touched a couple of movie stars and entertainers
Indeed, one in particular, almost started to name her, ha ha
I was there when you first pushed up and started to game her
Been a long journey, certain shit just don't concern me
They ain't hurtin' shit; we flip, they hire attorneys
Yo I'ma stay custom, 'til I'm old grey and rustin'
Reminiscin the number of chickens that claim we fucked 'em
Bet some badder hoes than them other funky rappers chose
I'm tryin' to wife a chick, light a spliff
Okay, this might be like another part to "Life's a Bitch"
Bite your lips, who's nice as this? We righteousness
No mic assists, it's murderous - granted the right to flip

[Refrain: AZ and Nas]
Yo we hard hit, just like Camacho and Vargas
Who's the target
Now watch how we close the market
We both hard hit, just like Hagler and Hearns
Add the math, be concerned, if it's beef you burn
Yo it's sorta like, Poitier and Bill Cosby
'Let's Do It Again,' a beautiful blend, let's do it to win
My nigga - my nigga - my niggas - my niggas
My niggas - my niggas - uhh..

Yo we hard hit, just like Camacho and Vargas
Who's the target
Now watch how we close the market
We both hard hit, just like Hagler and Hearns
Add the math, be concerned, if it's beef you burn
Yo it's sorta like, Poitier and Bill Cosby
'Let's Do It Again,' a beautiful blend, let's do it to win
My nigga - my nigga - my niggas - my niggas
My niggas - my niggas - uhh..

[Outro: Nas]
Like, Spinks and Hearns..
Sorta.. Poitier and Bill Cosby
'Let's Do it Again,' nigga
