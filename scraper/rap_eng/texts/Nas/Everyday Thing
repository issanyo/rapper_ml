Uh, word
You dont get this everyday word

With so much drama, in QBC it's kinda hard bein Escobaro
Eldorado red sippin Don out the bottle
My lifes like a Donald Goines novel,
We wave glasses like bravo Drunk niggas with mad problems
Shot pockets niggas on the block rock this
Buy cocaine cook it and chop it, lookin to profit
In triple ways goin through this difficult stage called life
With each year my physicals praised,
Niggas slip beyond the reach of help
Caught in the street, thinkin they can teach they self
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly feed our family these streets are insanity
Amber me, caught inside a thugs fantasy
Richest nigga in showbiz is what I plan to be
Heavy desire hold this 9' ready to fire, you know me show me the money like I'm Jerry McGuire, it's on..

Its time we set it straight, connect with Dre the correct way, predicted Platinum in less then a day
So for that we toast, this ones for us why you acting Hov, all I do is write rap, stack, relax and smoke
Watchin my dreams come true, stay humble in the eyes of others, politicing with the wisest brothers
Its Nature, one a the latest, peak how I play this, straight from the Bridge one of your kids favorites
From now till the day that I'm stiff, foul flagrant, pay the rent, always stay swift
Stuck in my ways type chauvinistic, since a youth I had a thing for big hoops, flooded rings and older bitches
Holdin my riches in lump-somes for trust funds, fully recovered thugs lust to bust guns
While some'll get drunk beat wives and cuss sons, a slow process called life lets show progress..

When I said I hold my own I wasn't frontin never claimed to be the baddest for skills, I got a little something
Coming through never the same old, hit a slick verse sippin drinks under a tropic rainbow
Nothin could give me more pleasure to spark this I worked the hardest, ducked the farthest makin me illest producing artist
Done crimes I ran from one time, could catch me with my crew bustin rhymes in the Sunshine
State, no case to fear I been with millionaires, out to make a killin for real's my resolution this year
Few places I walked most imagine, new faces I met at beauty pageants, past cuties now wanna do me
But never forgot where I was from, I check for family and every nigga who was down from day one
If you ain't speakin money language I can't hang with peak, your conversation is weak, I need the heat to get us famous, so it's senseless speak
