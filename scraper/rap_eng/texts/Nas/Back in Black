Back in black
I hit the sack
I've been too long I'm glad to be back
Yes I'm let loose
From the noose
That's kept me hanging about
Lookin' at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives
Cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and running wild

'Cause I'm back
Yes I'm back
Well I'm back
Yes I'm back
Well I'm hey hey hey hey
(Hey hey hey hey)
Well I'm back in black
Yes I'm back in black

Back in the back
Of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet
I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a band, with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now
I'm just makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck
Just get out of my way

'Cause I'm back
Yes I'm back
Well I'm back
Yes I'm back
Well I'm hey hey hey hey
(Hey hey hey hey)
Well I'm back in black
Yes I'm back in black

Well I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well I'm hey hey hey hey
(Hey hey hey hey)
Well I'm back in black
Yes I'm back in black

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Yes I am
Hey yeah, yeah oh yeah
Back in now
Well I'm hey hey hey hey, I'm back
Hey hey hey hey, (I'm back)
Hey hey hey hey, (I'm back)
Hey hey hey hey, (I'm back)
Hey hey hey hey, (I'm back)
Hey hey hey hey
Back in black
Yes I'm back in black

Out of sight
