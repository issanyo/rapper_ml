[Hook: Arlissa]
Oh it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh you took away my sunshine, now rain is all there is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh it's hard to let somebody when all I want is
All I want is you

[Verse 1: Nas]
Can we talk for a bit, brought you a miniature Yorkie
When you walk I mean you switch it engulfs me
Lick you off my lips like salt and vinegar chips
But now you act salty verbally you assault me
Often I'm in the star maxim yeah my star ship
Take me out tonight darling I beg your pardon
This wasn't part of our arrangement
Now you're bangin on my door I need an order of estrangement

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nas]
What you did to the kid ain't a bit as capital punishment
You wanna split that quick already done with us
You're the one I spend money with, winters and summer with
Thought it was more than sexual we was on some other ish
Vision your silhouette while in Tuscany
Luxury when you trusting me stressing me
I just up and leave, i'm staying psycho free
Hard to love somebody else but you
But now I'm missing you Arlissa

[Bridge]
You you you you you
All I want, all I need, yeah
Is you you you you you you you
Just you, oh

[Hook]
Oh it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh you took away my sunshine, now rain is all that is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh it's hard to let somebody, it's hard to let somebody
When all I want is you, when all I want is you
You you you, you you you, you you you
When all I want is you
