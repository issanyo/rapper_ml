I came from the city
Yeah, got my name from the city
Where? The most dangerous city
Let's take a trip back, back into time
1977, it was maximum crime
The President neglected us, him and 6 masterminds
6 powerful men put New York through some drastic times
The rich and selfish ones, feed off the welfare ones
And which borough suffered the worst? Hmm, where I'm from
The Bronx
We had to rumble with rivals on the rubble
While buildings around us would crumble
I dreamed right but it seemed like nothin' found me but trouble
I see the light, it's right there at the end of the tunnel
Had to find my rope, to pull me up
Cause I needed some kind of hope, to fill me up
'Til I met one guy, took me under the wing
I could have died if this man ain't intervene
He was an orphan, my savior, free spirited
No man braver, he was honored and gifted
His name was Shaolin Fantastic, the lady-killin' romantic
Can't forget the day we met, and this story recants it
But yo my life began last year, sophomore of high school
That summer I saw her, said to myself, "She'll be my wife soon"
