”Half Time”

Columbia
Production: Large Professor

This MC has slowly been collecting props on the down low in NYC. He added flavor to the Main Source’s “Live At The B.B.Q.” and recently went “Back To The Grill” with MC Serch. Now, after years as a guest star, Nasty Nas gets the chance to wreck a entire track without havin’ to pass the mic.

     Nas is one of those brothers who can drop freestyles on you without warning. And “Half Time’s” made-for-freestyling track (conservative bass, gritty snare and horn loop) is all Nas needs to catch wreck. His trademark is ill rhymes and punch lines galore. “I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships/I used to watch ‘Chip’s’ now I load Glock chips/I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic/Versatile, my style switches like a faggot/But not bisexual/I’m an intellectual/In rap I’m a professional/But that’s no question, yo!” Nasty Nas will definitely be starting trouble in ’93.
