[Verse One]
In my heart the sharpest pain
The darkest clouds up in my brain
Anger so immense and rage so deep
Each time he took one away from me
It's only now I see
They were angels too good to be
Here in this hell on earth and so he set them free
Only now I see, now I'm sure
I don't want no more brothers and sisters
Growing up in this cold world of war

[Chorus x2]
I ain't ready to die
But I ain't afraid to fly
And go check my
Bro's and sisters on the other side

[Verse Two]
Every day, they still walk with me
Every night, they still talk with me
They spirit deep in my soul
They oh so far but they closer than close
It's only now I see there are no more tears to shed
I done some crazy shit to ease all the mad confusion
And numbness in my head
Only now I see it's alright
Good hearts don't die
They just fly to be in peace
Beyond the sky

[Chorus x2]

[Breakdown]
Where there's no evil and no greed
No sign of war cause everybody's free
Where only joyful tears are cried
There's no pain
No tears
No lies
He'll free your soul
Free your mind
When it's your time
Your time

[Chorus x2]
