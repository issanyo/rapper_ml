[Intro: AZ]
Yeah, back off vacation
Time to send y'all birds on a permanent vacation though

[Verse 1: AZ]
Check my track record, respect is my black Lexus
Expect me to act reckless, I'm rich and I'm ass naked
A mink with half leopard, my drinks and my glass separate
I roll and I'm half breathless, just stroll through my last message
Like...niggas can't be serious
Never that leery shit, shit I'm mysterious
Move mystique on 'em, the doses increase on 'em
You ghost if you sleep on 'em
No joke when my peeps storming
Them cars they come in heavy
The God of the Serengeti
I charge with a large machete
And carve through your starving belly
Like...you shoulda known I was serious
Still the prettiest, point blank period

[Verse 2: Nas]
Feeding wild alligators on swamps, got miles and acres
No comp, whether it's freestyle, or written down on papers
So far, I've been down from maybe, a decade, I'm still the raw-rest
Plus, suede, and Ferragamo's, custom made jewelry's on us
Garments, fly apartments, they bugging say Nastradamus
Just wasn't one of my hardest, sold over a mil' regardless
Chill with them hard looks, I spark clips
If you Blood, or Muslim, 5 percent God, or Crip

[Verse 3: AZ]
Yeah, okay
Guns in the glove compartment
I'm dapper, but love the nonsense
The rapping, it numbs my conscience
I'm strapped when I come to concerts
Attack with a hundred monsters
They black and they running bonkers
We're back and we've come to conquer

[Verse 4: Nas]
The last of the fucking genre like...
Niggas can't be serious
Still the grittiest, point blank period
Flow tight as a midget's closet
As tight as a prison block is
No sight of po-lice, when we riot
Fighting the system fire
Get quiet, when I'm approaching
Get tires, jump out the roses
Sip Meyer's Rum out in open
I'm smoking that hydro, choking
I'm scoping, my eyes are on you
Don't reach 'cause I tried to warn you
No street corner Nas won't come to
To bomb you, .45's will harm you
Eccentric, I'm live but calm too
Cordial, but crazy cautious
Stroll through with some crazy gorgeous
Hoes, bodies like lady horses
Like...a whole stampede serious
Y'all niggas is funny like Eddie Murphy's Delirious
Sped up or real slow, never neo-soul
Hip-Hop only rocking with homie, we co-D's
Not Joss Stone, Hives, or Coldplay
If there was an old days, we pioneered it
Anthony Cruz, Nasir Jones shit, very serious
