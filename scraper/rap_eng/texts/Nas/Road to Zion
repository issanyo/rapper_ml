[Intro: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
Yeah man
Jah will be waitin there we a shout
Jah will be waitin there
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns we nuh know bout variety, boom

[Verse 1: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
Di youngest veteran a come murder dem slow
Raggamuffin sent to call me from di bush bungalow
Mi nuh watch it mek I clear out my voice now, Figaro
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow
Di hammer dem a slam and spectator getta low
Some bwoy could a big like Bam Bam Bigelow
Buss off trigger finger trigger hand and trigger toe
A two gun mi have mi buss dem inna stereo

[Hook: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
Cause, I got to keep on walkin, on the road to Zion land
Hey, we got to keep it burnin, on the road to Zion land

[Verse 2: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waitin there we a shout
Jah will be waitin there
Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waitin there we a shout
Jah will be waitin there

[Hook: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley & (Nas)]
Say, we got to keep on walkin (Yeah) on the road to Zion land
(Yeah, been waitin to do this track with you man, yeah, ha ha, yeah yeah)
You know (They know) you got to keep on walkin (Yeah) on the road to Zion land
(You gotta keep walkin y'all, yeah, yeah, you gotta keep...)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Sometimes I can't help but feel helpless
I'm havin daymares in daytime wide awake try to relate
This can't be happenin like I'm in a dream while I'm walkin
Cause what I'm seein is hauntin, human beings like ghost and zombies
President Mugabe holdin guns to innocent bodies
In Zimbabwe, they make John Pope seem Godly, sacrilegious and blasphemous
In my lifetime I look back in paths I walked, where savages fought and pastors taught
Prostitutes stomp in high heel boots
And badges screamin at young black children stop or I will shoot
I look back at cooked crack plus cars that pass by
Jaguars mad fly, and I'm guilty for materialism
Blacks is still up in the prison trust that
So save me your sorry I'm raisin a Army
Revolutionary warfare with Damian Marley
We sparkin a iron marchin to Zion
You know how Nas be NYC state of mind I'm in

[Bridge: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
In this world of calamity, dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority, media clowns we nuh know bout variety, boom

[Verse 4: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
Di youngest veteran a come murder dem slow
Ragamuffin sent to God before di bush bungalow
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow
Mi nuh watch it mek I carry out my voice now figarow
Di hammer dem a slam and spend day a dead now
Some bwoy could a big like Bam Bam Bigelow
Buss off trigger finger trigger hand and trigger toe
A two gun mi have mi buss dem inna stereo

[Hook: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
Cause, I got could keep on walkin, on the road to Zion land
Hey, we got to keep it burnin, on the road to Zion land

[Outro: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem tek yuh like who dem took out
Jah will be waitin there we a shout, Jah will be waitin there!!!!
Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem tek yuh like food dem to goat
Jah will be waitin there we a shout, Jah will be waitin there!!!!
In this world of calamity, dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority, media clowns we nuh know bout variety
Single parents weh need some charity
Yutes weh need some love and prosperity
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan with any means and strategy
Instead a broken dreams and tragedy
Yutes weh need some love and prosperity
Instead a broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan with any means and any strategy
Hey, I got to keep on walkin, on the road to Zion land
You know, you got to keep on walkin, on the road to Zion land
