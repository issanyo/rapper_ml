Ay yo..you... You that just flipped on this C.D. player:
I just wanna inform you that when you got somebody good, you hold on to 'em

Must be nice... having someone who understands the life you live
Must be nice... having someone who's slow to take and quick to give
Must be nice... having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick
Someone who smiles bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion

Must be nice...having someone who loves you despite your faults
Must be nice...having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk
Must be nice...having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too

Someone who loves you fa sho
You must remember to never let 'em go

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side, still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here

Must be nice... having someone you could come home to from a long day of work
Must be nice... having someone you don't have to show;
They know exactly where it hurts
Must be nice... having someone who trusts you...
Despite what they've heard
Someone as mighty as a lion, but still gentle as a bluebird

Must be nice... having someone you don't have to tell you don't wanna be wrong
Must be nice... having someone you can grow old with until God calls you home
Must be nice... having someone who understands that a thug has feelings, too
Someone that loves you fa sho, you never let em go!

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side, still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning (And they will stop one day)
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side, still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side, still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here
