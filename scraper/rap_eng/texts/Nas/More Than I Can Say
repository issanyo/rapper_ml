[Hook - Keyshia Cole]
I'm trying to put it all in words, but it's
More than I can say
It would take a whole lifetime to tell you
More than I can say
Every time I wrote a line itâ€™s still
More than I can say
This is the realest shit I ever wrote
More than I can say

[Verse 1 - Nas]
Bottles and El Dorados, trapped in the allure
The sickness: dreaming of riches
Reality was the cure. My doctor
Physician was music, I'm sure
The prescription was super-model sandwiches
And suicide doors. I used to stand in my mirror
Fixing up my hat right
DMV don't make licenses for the fast life
Was taught never drop my head when I'm doing right
And though I may be watched by feds with the blue sights
I just want the whole world to bop their heads
Someone to stop my bread
If my pops was here, he'd be like "son, you the one
They gotta crown you, a gift from around you
Know they don't understand you, but what can they handle?
If they was wearing Gucci loafers, they'd be through, over
Just stay on point, do what you do
Soldier: remember I'm with you when the world get colder..

[Hook - Keyshia Cole]

[Verse 2 - Nas]
Keep having the same dream
About a mic, a gun, a cross, they all
In the middle of flames
An hourglass of salt dripping down to its last grain
Hear a voice that asks what do I claim?
I ask what it means. It's sort of a trance
As the planet Earth appears in the palm of my hands
I could do what I wish with it, and waking up
To study my dreambook, see if it links up
Looking for some significance, like does the dream
Represent this cold world I'm living in?
Ask my man, then his laughter begin
He had the same dream, but in his, he grabbed the gun
Damn son! I told him in mine I took the mic
The cross, I had it all my life, the same height
I'm trying to sneak sleep, so that my mind won't find out
Time out: my body won't wind down
