[Nas]
Diamond cut vocals carved sculptures
Gats and holsters, MAC's and four-fifths
Do clap ferocious
We smoke spliffs when the dro's lit hoes get hit
Have them blow dick, blow the whole clique
Jeeps, Tahoe, shoes be Salvatore Ferragamo
Catch a homo, guns long like Mutombo
From Atlanta Hawk, rap phantom, stalk y'all
While we ban the pork, thought Fard taught y'all
The god sports all dijon, four wheel
Push the Range all year, vision a war near
I lay it out for y'all, its money and ice
That's how I'm running your wife
Stay whipping that Vipe
Clipping your life, down to pint size
Firm slice pies, couple of trife guys in tinted up white 5's

[Nature]
Who's the first to set it?
At times my thirst's pathetic
Nature one of The Firm, our word's phonetic
At seven digits, first class trips to some I'll never visit
Outlook, remain pessimistic
Used to jostle in hostile environments buying whips
Cheating life out of its requirements
Psychics predict that I'll be dying rich
Until then catch me chilling, flying in a giant six
On some next shit, went from humble, now it's hectic
Reminiscing when they use to call me desperate
Minor drawbacks, I had to learn not to fuck with small cats
In fake cartier and straw hats
Stick them on a mixtape, they think they're all that
But just speeding through, never sounding reasonable son
Whatever's the cost I know it's feasible
Bought your way in the game, the rates is seasonal

(Chorus) Nas
If we keep going hard, we're gonna take this money
Take money money take take money money
Take money take take money money
If we just play our part, we're gonna make this money
Make money money make make money money
Make money money make make money

[AZ]
You know how we're living, Firm shit nigga

Yo, circle through the orbit
Stock bonds, I own corporate
Rock velour shit
Filthy rich from Coke endorsements
You must've lost sense
My whole Firm we walk with offense
I push a Porsche bent
Fuck your main bitch off your expense
Laws intense, high rates
Death throughout the tri-state
Who violate? '98 Lex, NY plates
Well modernized, wide body cup with foreign eyes
You far behind, I'm rocking reptiles, you still in Karl Kani's
Guard your eyes, mystical movements hard to size
We harmonize and blew force that's way beyond the skies
Love position, parlaying, ducking drug convictions
Thug intentions every few months of this mission
Its principles, master my square, no identicals
Invisible, I've figured you wise so play it sensible

(Chorus) Nas X2

(Outro) AZ (Nas)
Yo you see, yo see what we're doing son
You stick 20 and we're making 40 (See how's going down)
And 40 gon' make 80 and 80, 160 son
We're entre-preneuring right now, (It's simple arithmetic)
Grossing development man (Corporate world)
You know what I mean? (I hope they're ready for the Firm niggas)
(They're ready for the Firm niggas?) Man, I don't think so
Son, hold up, pull that, pull that
(I don't think there's no other) They're mosquitoes right now
(I don't think there's no other families out there) They leeching
(That has the strength to survive in today's game, fo'real?) Ha ha ha
Playing with big boys now, man
You will recognize or feel what we're trying to do
(Millionaires behind big chairs) Or either feel what we're trying to do
(Word up)
