Represent for the ladies, hangin' outside, takin' in light
You know I'm comin' back, tell me if you're ready
Break it down for the fellas, movin' in smooth, keepin' it tight
You know I'm comin' back, tell me if you're ready

[Verse 1]
Hey you, I heard you wanted to party
Well I feel the same so I'm here to show you
What the music does to me, oh baby
It's in the rhythm and it's givin' me emotion (Givin' me baby)
Hotter than fire and stronger than any potion
There's no way around this groove
And I have come back to thank you

[Refrain]
Represent for the ladies, hangin' outside, takin' in light
You know I'm comin' back, tell me if you're ready
Break it down for the fellas, movin' in smooth, keepin' it tight
You know I'm comin' back, tell me if you're ready

[Verse 2]
Tonight is right, we're having a good time
Just lay back and relax, it's time and you know it
Because I'm coming straight to you, ya Know
It's in the rhythm and it's givin' me emotion (Givin' me baby)
Hotter than fire and stronger than any potion
Music always makes me smile

[Refrain]
Represent for the ladies, hangin' outside, takin' in light
You know I'm comin' back, tell me if you're ready
Break it down for the fellas, movin' in smooth, keepin' it tight
You know I'm comin' back, tell me if you're ready

[Bridge]
It's been a long time since we partied all night, like tonight
Are you ready? Are you ready? I am ready
It's been a long time since we partied all night, like tonight
Are you ready? Are you ready? I am ready

[Refrain x2]
Represent for the ladies, hangin' outside, takin' in light
Aaliyah's comin' back, tell me if you're ready
Break it down for the fellas, movin' in smooth, keepin' it tight
You know I'm comin' back, tell me if you're ready
