[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Emerged from the bottom, made my way through the gravel
Turn me 'to a survivor, I ain’t want to, I had to
Now I’m shining my nigga, in the mist of the scramble
Shooting cee-lo and craps, every day is a gamble
Good lord never gave me nothing I couldn’t handle
I hustle without a menu til they blow out my candle
Diamond in the rough, y'all niggas gem stones
I pen poems to the point I had to switch homes
New location, no vacations
Sitting comfy on the money, down with paper chasing
Second to none, and nothing’s adjacent
Could probably see it from space we did it up in Vegas
Picture me rolling, in a pair of penny loafers
European chauffeur, I’m 'laxed like shit is kosher
Uh, that’s how it ought to be, no! That’s how it gotta be
VVS quality living with no apology, nigga!

[Hook: K-Young]
Diamonds and girls, I hustle hard
For these diamonds and girls!
And now I’m in the spotlight
I live for diamonds and girls
Trunk full of hundreds, speakers on blast
[?]
You don’t want no problems, problems
I’m trying to get more diamonds and girls

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I’m like an invisible set, in other words, what I mean
I just can’t be seen, I just gleamed
People stare at me, as if is rare to see a jewel with such clarity
Apparently I revel in the
Fact that y'all can't get on my level
I belong in the bezel, I’m specialist at 38
Words to that grizzly city murder rate
And all the real niggas serve away
Princess cuts for the king of the city, totin' a semi
Pull strings like Jimmy, accumulated plenty of glow
Plenty of dough, more champagne and Henny to pour
Remember when he was poor
Now it ain’t hard to spot him up on Fairfax shopping
But not for boxes of shoes, bought a few watches
That’s how it ought to be no, that’s how it gotta be
VVS quality living with no apologies

[Hook: K-Young]
Diamonds and girls, I hustle hard
For these diamonds and girls!
