[Verse 1]
I wake up in the mornin' with a appetite
For money, gotta make sure that he right
Best weed keep me higher then a satellite
Where I'm from, life's a gamble, grab the dice
'Fore I leave, pray to God, then I grab my Nikes
Remember those times I knew I had to fight
Nigga might run up on you at the traffic light
Wind up in some heavy shit if you packin' light
Now a days, strap up, they ain't packin' nice
Streets made of ice, slip, that's your life
To live and die in CA, from the home of PA
Guaranteed to make it pop like a fuckin' briefcase
Come where I stay, not too far from the Bay
About two-hundred-twenty miles from LA
You'll find FC in the middle of the state
Valley of the kings where it all takes place

[Hook]
And they say that it never rains in Central California, California
And they say that if you don't watch your back, they'll run up on ya, run up on ya
And they say that it never rains in Central California, California
And they say that if you don't watch your back, they'll run up on ya, run up on ya
Take your life, take your soul
So I think twice, the streets is cold
And that's how it goes
Down in Sunny California, California

[Verse 2]
I'm from the home of the three strikes
And before you trust a nigga, better think twice
Cause they be all in your house while you at church
Come home and shit gone, I know that hurts
Come back the next day, sell you a bag of perc
I know it sound bad, but I've seen worse
A pimp told me "a ho is just an open purse"
A ho told me a pimp don't see what she worth
Think that a shame, that's the game and we all in it
Hollywood, don't take it personal, it's all business
Understood, candy painted cars dippin' throughout the hood
E&J, Optimo's and Backwood's
All the little homies wanna be like Suge
Attitude like "I wish a nigga would"
But it's all good where I stay
Sunny Californ-I-A

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm from the home of the three strikes
And before you trust a nigga, better think twice, think twice
From the home of the three strikes
And before you trust a nigga, better think twice, better think twice
