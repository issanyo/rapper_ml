[Intro]
For all my shorties out there, if you've ever been discouraged. Somebody told you you can't do nothing. It's all up to you, you can be whatever you want; a doctor, a lawyer, a physician, a nurse... The world is yours

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Hold on to your dreams 'til they come true
Don't let them tell you what you can or can't do
I know it's hard trying to make it on your own two
Surviving, at the same time going to school
And trying to pay tuition by washing dishes
It's all part of being self-sufficient
Look for a shooting star and you keep on wishing
Who's to say 5 years from
Now where you'll end up?
CEO of your own business
Or, a movie star an award winner
Gotta, go for it can't be timid
Nah, live out the phrase the sky's the limit
Understand everything began with a vision
Some hard work and a thing called
Intuition
That's, when you feel you're at you're lowest and you're about to collapse
And let you know you're on the right track sing along

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
Hey young world (Hey young world)
The world is yours, the world is yours
Hey young world (Hey young world)
You can aim for the stars you can climb you can crawl
Hey young world (Hey young world)
The sky's the limit, the sky's the limit
Hey young world (Hey young world)
The world is yours, the world is yours

[Verse 2: Aloe Blacc]
I know it might sound a little bit like preaching
But ain't a star in the sky that ain't worth reaching
Already done caught a few and threw some back
I shook them up in my fist and threw them out like craps
I done seen some fools shoot them up like crack
And then I watched as they're star faded out like (snap)
Can you find it inside of you, the gift that God provided you
And read the little note he left that says the things you gotta do
To make your life a healthy example of his perfection?
Ease with the breeze don't fight life's direction
It's gonna be some ups and downs it's no question
That the hard times you make it through teach the best lessons
He who never tries never fails
But if you don't ever try you're a failure, I don't know what to tell you
From God's Sons to Rulers all the new schooler
B-boys and girls remember it's your world

[Hook]

[Outro: Devoya Mayo & Aloe Blacc]
Your eyes have slightly opened
The sun is widely open
The new day is finally here
No thoughts of failure your future is clear
The young world is now before you
Because the old world oh it couldn't hold you
You can tell others to sit back and watch it all unfold
See young world you must be patient and ready
And it's essential to keep on believing in you
And now your eyes are widely open
Your dreams are close at hand
You may have felt lost once but now you're found see
The old, the young, and the new, were always within you

Hey young world
Hey young world
Hey young world
Hey young world
The world is yours, the world is yours
