[Verse 1: ElZhi]
Yeah, y'all should kiss the ring
And want me to reign the way flowers wish for spring
My punchlines provoke fists to swing, till the wrist is sprained
Who diss this won't exist the same
Thought he was fly, but he missed his plane, he scared pissless
That why his mistress giving promiscuous brain and this is
Just the tip of the iceberg a statue in cold blood and now you sleep with the fishes
And vicious piranhas I'm convinced your persona's fictitious
Ever since [?]
Besides amateurs
Niggas were flexed up me and Maybachs when they shoulda been pushing Dodge Challengers
That's who is the best you don't compute, you can rest in the suit
Or on your back with a boot in the chest, just saluting the flesh
This kinda gift would leave a mutant impressed
Don't get cut up like shooting a slug after shooting a vest
What? What could these niggas lacking? Tell me
Fuck a comeback, this shit is like Machiavelli
And hard to stomach like some Cognac [?]
Official, industry niggas contact the celly
So y'all consume bout after I blow because I balloon now
From coming sharp of the dome like cum laude
The first to said it, the spit in verse pathetic
I give you the curse, the hearse or the nurse and medic

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Last of the real, master with that, massive appeal
Mash on the feel, Fash out to kill, pass me the steel
You'll end up in a casket concealed
Moments after that gag get revealed
This ain't backpack rap, this is cats getting peeled
Cracks of the thrills, stack full of bills, racks for the grill
Gas mask full of hash, how we build
It's not a paragraph it's appeal, black
I’m the furthest thing for rap, and I chill, refrigerator
Couldn't find a nigga greater than I
Through my peripherals
See the hate in they eyes, it's pitiful
And your comparison to the gods is inphysical
Militant thoughts from a general combined with a
Sincere, 25th year, I ship kush and piss beer
I'm connecting with my nigga from the slum
No - I'm not from Queens but I did it for my duns
To my village you should come
I suggest for you inter-grizzly city, get a gun
Pap pap said the semi when it sung
I’m writing to the sirens that scream through the ghetto
When it comes to pulling strings I'm Geppetto
Seen everything but this level, still
Attached to a triple beam in the treble, it's F
