[Intro]
I don't know how, no
And I don't know why
Lord, we were sent here to die
As the tears drop from my third eye
Oh, Mother Earth, I can hear your cries
I can hear your cries
I can hear you cry
Now I don't know when
No, I don't know where
Or if God is coming back
Or if He was even there
I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya

[Verse]
So much irrational behavior
We cutthroats casually
Spiritual depravity
Money is your new majesty
I'm in search of, in search of
A new habitat for humanity
No time to sleep, no canopies
Brand new day, different brand of weed
It was a world outside of my window
I just had to see for the fallacies
False doctrines, true lies
False prophets since I came out the womb
What I came to consume made me confused
Wondering which way do I move
Man, do evil or do good?
The confrontation constantly
I'm contemplating being this conscious, it's complicated
I wish we could recycle all this time we wasted
From Washington to Obama's nation
Your memory box is inside the matrix
You can't determine if it's God or Satan
Controlling your actions
A controllable attraction
And the globe is filled with madness
Only guarantees is death and taxes
It's ratchet, nigga

[Outro]
Now I don't know when
No, I don't know where
Or if God is coming back
Or if He was even there
I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya
I don't know how, no
And I don't know why
Lord, we were sent here to die
As the tears drop from my third eye
Oh, Mother Earth, I can hear your cries
I can hear your cries
I can hear you cry
