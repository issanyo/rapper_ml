Ey Ey Ey Minamo Tiamo Minamo

Zion and Minamo, Jabingy is the motto
The bass gon' fuck you up, you like it tough than arigato
Bu bu bouncin' always Indy,  So bump me in your bizi
Bu bu bump me in your bizi, Do Your head start feeling dizzy?
The legs are feelin' jelly, we can't not be ready
The super duper trooper with bazooka bass so heavy
Ba ba bazooka bass so heavy
This chevy gon' dip, step into my mothership, take another trip

I'm feelin' lost in the crowd, and I don't wanna lose touch, nah
Like it's about to go down down, well you can never get enough

Now everything's...
Poppin' bars, kitchen white, mix the lean with the sprite
Gettin' brain, different pipe, get the change
Now Everything's...
Poppin' bars, kitchen white, mix the lean with the sprite
Gettin' brain, different pipe, get the change

Raise your hand, touch the sun, megaton phenomenon
Here it come, drop the bomb, fire up another one
What it do, thought you knew, what the BOOMER do to you?
Crush the feelin' with my cool, meet me at the Okazoo

I'm sittin on the suburb, my bitch seeing double
I'm whippin' in my crack, Burning rubber in the gutter
I'm standing on the speakers, I'm bustin' on FO FO

I'm getting deeper, deeper, deeper ,deeper....

I'm feelin' lost in the crowd, and I don't wanna lose touch
Like it's about to go down down, well you can never get enough


Now everything's...
Poppin' bars, kitchen white, mix the lean with the sprite
Gettin' brain, different pipe, get the change
Now Everything's...
Poppin' bars, kitchen white, mix the lean with the sprite
Gettin' brain, different pipe, get the change
