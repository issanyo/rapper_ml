I did it without a track from Kanye, a beat from Dr. Dre
A hook from T-Pain, a co-sign from Jay
A 16 from Drake, a cameo from Snoop, a dance like Soulja Boy
You gotta salute how I came in the game, took it back to the essence
Put it back in perspective, what an immaculate conception
I'm complex, still ain't made the cover of Complex
Bomb sets, for trying to intercept my conquest
