[Intro]
They say everything you go through in life makes life worth living
But if the world should end tomorrow...
I often think about that sometimes, know what I'm saying?

[VERSE 1]
I'll take the pain and the strife
I know it's not in vain
And struggle relate to everything in this life
I'm maintaining became a beam of light for the youth in the streets
Intertwining with goons never complaining cuz its all written
Don't be bitter we all sinners
Lusting for the good life, some hearts cold as December
Hiding behind stripes and stars Father forgive um
Earth out of her mind look what she had to witness
I talk to her at times she tell me what's on her heart
I tell her what's on my mind
Momma where do I start?
Why everybody divided?
Why people afraid to die?
She told me "talk to ya Father, he's in the sky."

[VERSE 2]
Father why everybody complaining bout what they got?
Ungrateful, they don't see what you gave um?
Make a lump sum of money start to thinking they made it
He said if you pay attention to the weather I'm jaded
It could be mid July and I feel like raining
Any day of the year I shed a tear Poppa amazing
One drop could flood the block there's no one greater
And that's why I live in the sky
No lie, I'm fly, defy gravity, I reply damn
It's like you only show yourself to the wise
I know why you won't let me come home
Left me here on my own cuz I ain't doing my job so you just letting me roam
He responded "correct" go home to my mom I'm vexed
She the reason for my drama and stress, you seem to love her
Remember though, she the present but I'm forever
Won't be long till you see us together I replied until than...

[Hook]
Now if the world should end tomorrow, Lord have mercy on me
And if the sky should fall and the walls come tumbling down, tumbling down

Now if the world should end tomorrow, Lord have mercy on me
And if the sky should fall and the walls come tumbling down, tumbling down
Then that's what its gonna be
Then that's what its gonna be
