[Verse 1: Murs]
I never wear nothing smaller than a 34 jean
Or maybe 32, but at least I keep 'em clean

[Fashawn]
And I don't rock nothing bigger than 758 sized fitteds
A fly nigga, word to my regime

[Murs]
I'm devastating, the one that every rapper fears

[Fashawn]
Elevating, floating past the stratosphere

[Murs]
I heard you got a buzz going on for yourself, that's fucking awesome

[Fashawn]
Ain't that the same kid we seen in South by in Austin?

[Murs]
I started out with the

[Fashawn]
Youngins on the strip

[Murs]
But now all I get his hella money when I spit

[Fashawn]
I swear I came up from a onion to a brick

[Murs]
How will you sloppy ass niggas ever amount to shit?
I'm game type

[Fashawn]
Naming lice
It ain't a game, I'm aiming precise
Pay with your life

[Murs]
You better watch how you moving running up on Fash

[Fashawn]
Do it bare face, I don't need no mask, nigga

[Hook: Krondon]
Come take a trip 'round my way
A place where weird kids don't play
Everyday
You see the caution tape when somebody caught a case
And I'm just trying to stay in my lane and beat the papers up
Staying papered up, pape-pape-papered up
Papered up, pape-pape-papered up
Papered up, pape-pape-papered up
I beat them haters up, staying papered up

[Verse 2: Murs]
I never thought twice about running from the one time

[Fashawn]
Getting duckies under the California sunshine

[Murs]
I always thought I'd be the first

[Fashawn]
To leave the east-side in a hearse
To reside in the dirt

[Murs]
Man, I been on this shit, I been on the grind
I been on the spit

[Fashawn]
Nigga, I been on the shine

[Murs]
I won't ever

[Fashawn]
Let this game get the best of me

[Murs]
So you can't ever

[Fashawn]
Make me swallow my integrity

[Murs]
Years after I leave this Earth

[Fashawn]
I'll probably resurrect, come back even worse

[Murs]
Cause it's only two ways to come up in this game

[Fashawn]
That's hustle over time and stay in your line

[Murs]
And I'd be damned if I don't get mine

[Fashawn]
At the end of the day, I still got that nine

[Murs]
So watch what you say

[Fashawn]
And watch what you do

[Murs]
Cause I might be the one

[Fashawn]
To blow up the top of your coupe

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
I've never been the one to shy away from the truth

[Fashawn]
So high I might rise out the booth

[Murs]
Align, motherfucker

[Fashawn]
And this is the guy you recruit?

[Murs]
I can't be responsible

[Fashawn]
If he dives of the roof

[Murs]
How you think I'm supposed to act?

[Fashawn]
Tell me, how the fuck am I supposed to rap?

[Murs]
You better know where you stand
And watch who you trust

[Fashawn]
Especially dealing with guys like us, nigga
