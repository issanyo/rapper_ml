[Intro]

You see lil' homie I come from an era right
Where if you was doing this you had to be the best at it man
That's why we did this to be great
When I was coming up, the era I come from
The era of Rakim, Nas, 2Pac, Biggie the list goes on
It was about being great you understand
That's what this here is about
It was about the love
That jiggy shit is over man

[Verse 1]

I started off in the cypher
On point like a sniper
While ya'll was rambling
Bout your glam and glitz
The hundred grand you spend
I used to scribble to the sound on an ambulance
Picked up a pad and pen
Momma couldn't afford a mandolin or a saxophone
I made a song out a stack of poems
As I would blast Capone
Noreaga trying to rap along or at least match the tone
It ain't all for the celery
Found myself getting lost in the melody
Somewhere between art and celebrity
Please do get me wrong I would never leave you, nah
Long as I got your hearts it don't matter if I top the charts
But never mind taking L's when you raised in hell
Still humble and can't ya tell

[Chorus] Fashawn (Sam Smith)

I don't have
(Money on my mind)
Na don't have
(Money on my mind)
I do I do (it for the love)
(I don't have money on my mind) Na
(Money on my mind)
I do it for I do (for the love)
Hey hey hey hey hey
(I do it for the love)
Hey hey hey

[Verse 2]

I mean a platinum plaque would be nice
For everything I had to sacrifice
Remember I sat up nights debating
Should I bag the white or grab the mic
I'm good at taking bad advice
I mean, even from myself
Somewhere between rich and wealth
Since my first LP hit the shelf
I've been mentally living in a distant realm, different
Got an accountant and an assistant
A pound just for twisting
Guess that's what you get for being persistent
And success is what you make it
Opportunity's for the taken
The paper was strict and naked
So history is what I'm chasing

[Chorus]

[Outro]

For the L-O V-E (x8)
Young F Man
Its Fash-Shawn
Uh, 2-0 1-4
Let's go
It's from the heart man
From me to you
I do it for the L-O V-E (x6)
