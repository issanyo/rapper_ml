[Verse 1]
Cen Cal terrain, soak up game
Where graff writers bomb trains
And poets is smoked out with dope in they veins
Need a toast to the post where we hang
Dialect unmatched
Gotta adapt to the slang that's spoke, a West coast thing
Out of town niggas get took out the frame
Just for thinkin' every hood's the same
Especially where I'm from, we live by the gun
Put money over bitches, and die over funds
You could lie in the trunk or at the blink
Of an eye get jumped, can't say we seen it all
But we can say we saw enough
Survive when the times got rough
And the money got low, houses got raided
We was at the park gettin' faded, not a care in the world

[Hook]
"West coast in ya area"
"From the streets of the 'No"
"5-5-9" "My birthplace" "L-A"
"Where I'm comin' from"
"The Coast of the Pacific"

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Another two days, the sun set, they lose like touche
Too bad, I was off the head like toupees
Got home off two planes, toothaches
To-day, myspace, two-thousand plays
Last call for alcohol's 2AM
On a Tuesday night, we was sayin'
Know this our way, LA party crashin'
We from here, y'all talk funny, y'all got the accents
East slopes to the beach, post up each
Every day, new trees, Cali green
Green leafs, weed medicine cards
Streets got eyes in 3D
Still peep, polluted air when I sleep
Fuckin' up the count in my sheep
The far left, I'm part of the next
Shine different, work hard, not gonna bottle the stress

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Skate parks jumpin', one-time focus
Young niggas pumpin', hoodrats scopin'
At the bus stop, brothers might slide through dumpin'
Broad daylight outside like "fuck it"
Hood rich, we drive-by in buckets
With chrome 22's on the side, call it stuntin'
Flamboyant young hustlers and
Couch bums who amounted to nothin'
Mouthpiece help me get dough
Out a chick in the mall buyin' fresh clothes
Some broads got burned out
Erica turned 17 and got turned out
That's how we live in the streets of the F
Paranoid so I sleep wit a Tec, valley of death
I'm from the Sunshine State, but we livin' in darkness
Be smart nigga, enter with caution, it's F-C

[Hook]
