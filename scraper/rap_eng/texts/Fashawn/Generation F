[Intro]
Ay Yo I'm focused man
Tell stouts to holler at me man
Ay yo It's International F
Check it, and I'm back in effect
C&S, Forever
Bigger dreams this time

[Song]
My mission:
To take over the world and give it a makeover
Penetrate pop culture soon as I got older
Enough to deal with luckily stuck with the music
Stacey Dash, young and clueless
Running rampant through the ghetto
Should have got a gold medal
How we used to hop fences you swear it was the Olypmics
Every day in the mutherfuckin' trenches
We made that weight disappear like Centa
Started with 37 Cents, some dimes and some nicks
As soon as I climbed out the crib I was playing with my Uncle's 38
Special, a 45 by the age of nine that was his
And my mamma tried to save me
But couldn't understand I was grooming myself to be a man
Or maybe I was crazy
Thinking I was so fly that a nigga would never land, ya dig
I'm surrounded by animals, dogs and grizzly bears
Hawks there's plenty here
Catch you in the lobby with a llama and ?
Any problem with my posse
Somebody gon' disappear
I skipped school now I'm on top of my class
Graduated from a corner to a block and a half
Give me a month and some change, you do the math
Two keys of some white, Angelina and Brad
Yeah it's Fash
Probably remember me from bleaking the ave
Or on campus, stacking, pitching weed to the staff
Keeping the scent of reefer in my Jansport wreaking
Hoping that I re-up before the weekend
Peep it, I'm like a hundered round drummer, I spit automatic
Known to keep shit cracking like the lips on an addict
Let me stutter at you niggas if I sense static
My status is, similar to the stitch on my fabric
I got it sewn
Santiago the scent of my cologne
Straight off a vacay leave him alone
I decipher, any cipher hit it and get it hyper
Shitting on you niggas cuz somebody delivered diapers
You spending every minute on Twitter, you minimizing
You ain't interested in the business or enterprising at all
You can ball and cry
While we ball get fly
And money multiplies, you heard
Herbs
That's my word

[Outro]
