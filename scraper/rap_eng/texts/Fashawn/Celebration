[Verse 1]

Yo my team
Go way harder than the rest of you
We don't throw parties, we throw festivals
Lord, gotta forgive me, Im gone off of this Henny
In the light it's just right, feel like I just might
Celebrate with the fam, light this J in my hand
Maybe take out this cam, demostrate for the gram
Chef Gordon, watchin bitches get naked for the bands
Where all the naysayers  and player haters is banned
How I grind, you wouldn't last a day in my Vans
When I shine, the result, my name in demand
Never taking advice, I'd rather take an advance
Rather take a flight and vacay to Japan
Damn I worked for it, fam is worth toastin'
Cognac & Moet, plenty packs of Trojans
Dude do it major, new Mr. Leyva
Enjoying the fruits of his labor
I might as well...

[Verse 2]
So leave your drama at the door
Vamanos, it's a rendevous so I gotta roast
Lotta jokes, lotta smoke
Pop bottles in every borrough and barrio
Champagne made the block feel like the Bellagio
Case of Dom and some dominos
Dinero, Sucio and designer clothes
Some of my friends, fellas, happy they're finally home
[?] more than a [?}, showed them they not alone
No more window love, heres a window seat
I sent the info, peace!
You got your freedom, I got my success
That's a good enough reason for us to not be stressed
Well at least for the moment, fuck it, this beach ima soak in
Forgot about the streets once my feet hit the ocean
Celebrated the fact that I levitated
Outta the category, of you rappers that never made it
It's 'Shawn!
