[Intro]
I'm still trying to see what my victory music sounds like
You know what I'm sayin?
I'm workin on it
Uh, uh huh, I birthed you niggas
You keep acting up I'ma earth you niggas
Uh huh, uh

[Verse 1]
Similar to Moses, I would give you niggas Manna
This that Grizzly City grammar
This a brick inside a Phantom, fuck around, Instagram it
I could never ditch the camera
You can find me in the gutter, ditch me with the glitz & glamour
Hammer, on my hip, Cal, let a grip, Blaow!
Now you hit, hear that, loud in the spliff
Crowd know its piff leave you sittin' with the clouds
Body found by a ditch
All I need is a few pounds and a mound
I can pitch
Got a diva, got divas, chocolate brown and she thick
Went to town with her lips, southbound on a dick
Round-trip, leave a California cloud then I dip
On a prowl for the chips, got the crown in my grip
Leave you grounded and pissed shootin' rounds til it click
Hold it, down til every grizzly, 'round me is rich
Go head, lose yo head, put underground I insist
Shoot a rapper out his kilt, give his gown to my bitch
The meanest

[Hook]
Breathe, kill, murder, survive
Hustle, struggle, the pain, the pride
Breathe, kill, murder, survive
Hustle, struggle, the pain, the pride
Breathe, kill, murder, survive
Hustle, struggle, the pain, the pride
Breathe, kill, murder, survive
Hustle, struggle, the pain, the pride

[Verse 2]
I admit
I been hibernating
Public saying 'Why you waiting?"
Must be off psilocybin
Left me out the conversation
Trying to go from movin' grams
To a Grammy nomination
I done seen all kinds of hatred
Since the day of my invasion
Now it come, smiley faces
Foes by the congregation
Clothes from designer
Made it, safe with the combination
Club, got the bottles waitin'
Drugs, done in moderation
Slugs, for the confrontation
Homies, hollow cases
No congratulations, send my condolences
Yo career is over kid
Too much baking soda in it
He noticed
Ima name brand figure
Game plan, bigger
Who iller?
Bet you couldn't name that nigga
Its 'shawn
I belong, at the top
In my palm, got a knot
Whip it soft, til it rock
Sell it hard, its my block
My turf, my body or my hood
My product everybody know whats good
Understood, Its 'Po!

[Hook]
Breathe, kill, murder, survive
Hustle, struggle, the pain, the pride
Breathe, kill, murder, survive
Hustle, struggle, the pain, the pride
Breathe, kill, murder, survive
Hustle, struggle, the pain, the pride
Breathe, kill, murder, survive
Hustle, struggle, the pain, the pride
