[Verse 1:]

Her name was Lupita, met her at school
Real sophisticated, kinda preppy but cool
I wrote her a poem and captured her heart
It put me in the friend zone, but that was a start
See, I started noticing her in a whole 'nother light
Was the inspiration for every love song I would write
Dreams of holding her tight I tried to prevent
Not liking her I tried to pretend that her and I were just friends
And it's a thin line, emotions, I bottled 'em in
Just a foolish love jones, what this probably is
Captivated by her lips every time I conversate with her
Wanna make her mine, what I'm waiting for
I gotta let her know

[Hook 2x]
She driving me crazy
Feelings starting to show
With her I wanna go
Think I'm moving too slow
I got's to let her know
I got's to let her know

[Verse 2:]

About telling her how I feel, I'm kinda hesitant
Afraid of rejection, intimidation is evident
She way out of my league, but that's irrelevant
To how I feel, my feelings just keep developing
Just let her know how you feeling, my niggas recommend
Hundred girls but only one I'm interested in
And that's her the definition of what beautiful is
Intelligent, and she far from the usual
Not just a schoolboy crush, it's deep in my heart
Bashful, keeping her in the dark
Not just a schoolboy crush, man it's deep in my heart
When she don't know, am I wrong for keeping her in the dark

[Repeat Hook 2x]

[Bridge]

'Shawn & Lupita sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Everybody says she's out of my league
And she would never go for a guy
Like me

[Verse 3:]

I'm thinking maybe I should write her a note
I'm in the mirror rehearsing
Plotting how to approach
Cause she fine as hell, you gotta agree
I'mma just give it a shot, how hard could it be
I finally stepped to her and let her know how I felt
Her brown eyes made my heart melt, couldn't breathe
That's when she replied, "Maybe in another life,"
Cause I just wasn't her type, but (Aww man)

[Repeat Hook]
