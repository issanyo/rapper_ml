[Verse 1:]
Picked up the homie from the airport
She ain't seen me ever since I cut my hair short
Set her briefcase in the back
Gave me a kiss then threw her hand on my lap
Then off the bat we out to meet her connect
She said his name is art from Sinaloa, respect
I'm out on east los trying to make this drop
They pet me down asking questions thinking I'm a cop
They finally stopped, let her cop, then we out
First I gotta show her what King Taco is about
I walk in, the homie say 'Que paso, Murs?'
Sweet tooth, so she order the dessert first
She had a Flan de canela
He laughed at her when she asked how (?) us
Light meal, cause she know she about to go to work
After we eat, hit the suite, then she go berserk
Ripped off my shirt, unzipped my pants
I pushed her down on her knees with both hands
Born in Dior, but she reside in Bedstuy
She sucked me dry then she hopped on a red eye

[Hook: Adrian]
You're my soul
You got the best of me
My ghetto queen, no lie
You stormed my heart in a flash
Even (?) you stay on my mind
She said the beat goes on

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Okay, I'm gon' try and make this long story short
Don't know where to begin
Last time I saw her I ain't have no hair on my chin
Met her through the sister of my man big Chris
Like some shit from out the flicks, but wouldn't want a cut ever since
I turned 15
Fast forward now got the bitch running schemes
My dinero clean
Cause she thought the youngin how to launder that
Used to (?), BG to the laundry mat
Drug game, murder game, was about all of that
Learned it all from her father who was a Harlem cat
Her momma, she was a Harvard grad
Bad lady sent her daughter to swallow that ave
I can't deny, I was in love
And my mind like, mami's the one
But she replied, I was too young
Slipped me a pie, oh how I blew up
But her other guys wouldn't give her up
Finally recognized
The size of a niggas nutsh
Told her I'd die before I give her up
Before I know it she in some cuffs
Ain't had enough time to let her flush
