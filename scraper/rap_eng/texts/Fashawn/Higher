[Intro]
I said y'all wanna get higher?
Y'all know we gonna get higher
I said y'all wanna get higher?
Y'all know we gotta get higher

[Verse 1]
Became a prisoner of peoples expectations
Some of my fans are doctors, even they don't have the patience
To wait up while I evolve creatively
I wish there was 8 of me
1 to deal with temptation, 1 to deal with complacency
1 to deal with the pressure, 1 to deal with this fame
1 to deal with the power, 1 strong enough for the pain
1 to hold my umbrella to shelter me from the rain
1 to be my therapist, my thoughts is crowding my brain
I get insomnia and probably cause
I convinced myself that I was not the one
Struggling through my Twitter
Stupid niggas, listeners are disloyal
But they make you feel royal
But like a slave when they no longer enjoy you my nigga
That's not high enough, please let's take it higher
Headliner, shit I'm glad I even made the flyer
This game'll crucify ya just to make you a martyr
Sometimes I'd rather ice skate with my daughter, but
Yall don't hear me though

[Hook]
Higher, take me up, take me up
I need you to take me higher
I wanna reach something I can't touch, I can't touch
So get high, so get high
And get high, and get high
So get high, so get high
Let's get high, let's get high
So get high, so get high
Let's get high, let's get high
So get high, so get high
And get high, and get high
Higher, take me up, take me up
I need you to take me higher
I wanna reach something I can't touch, I can't touch
So let's take it higher

[Bridge]
I'll tell you when it's high enough
I'll tell you when it's high enough

[Verse 2]
Y'all would rather break me down like reefer
And stuff me into a paper
Temporary reliever while you lay up like a Laker
I'm working 24/7, wondering where the day went
Feeling taken for granted, feeling underestimated
Do I need the recognition when i have the reputation?
You're thinking entertainment, I'm thinking elevation
In an industry that's saturated, but I'm glad I made it
I've seen anticipation turn to aggravation
When you don't meet the demand and people think you the man
It's back to the factory, keep on putting comands
Mind running rapidly tryna make a classic
Am I running out of battery? Questions you start asking yourself
Oppose to asking for help, hell I don't need it
I thought all I had to do was beat the odds and we'd be even, damn
Before you know it I be back on the road
Text message from my daughter it said "daddy come home"
But y'all love me though

[Hook]

[Outro]
Hi daddy, I miss you and I love you. Hope you come home safely. You can take me to the park, the swimming pool and long walks and talk all day long and I can keep you all day and sleep with you, and I like your music, it's pretty and I want to give you hugs
