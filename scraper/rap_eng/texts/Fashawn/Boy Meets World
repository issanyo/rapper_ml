[Verse One]
I started off just a boy trying to find himself
On an earth that I hardly knew
Life just wasn't what it seemed on the TV screen
I can't lie tho', my eyes were glued
I grew up in the US
Off welfare checks
No stability, we'd always move
Either in with my aunt cause my mama ain't work
Our favorite day of the month: the first
That's when we'd go shop
We'd go spend
Spent most my time with my so-called friends
Hanging out in the streets watching the world go by
So stuck in the moment I forgot I was even alive
I didn't know about death until my grandma passed
To tell the truth, it never crossed my mind
She told me pray before I go outside
And trust no man cause you'd be surprised
When the boy meets world

[Hook]
Now you've come so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world
Now you've come so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world

[Verse Two]
By '96 it was me and my sis
Big bro left was like he ain't exist
Dad was never around
I ain't even trip, cause I had a step father
When Randy ain't bother
Was in the late eighties when him and my mama split
Soon as I was born he winds up in the pen
I wind up with a pen, a paper, and a dream
Before I realized this is where my life begins
Started writing poems when I hit the group home
First time I remember ever feeling alone
Whole lot to handle for a nine-year-old
In my mind fantasized about flying to Rome
Leaving everything behind even at a tender age
Uncle always thought I was going through a phase
Until I hit the studio
Until I hit the stage
Just scribbling my life on the page
When the boy meets world

[Hook]
Now you've come so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world
Now you've come so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world

[Verse Three]
Started rhyming in junior high school
Out of love
All I needed was some fly shoes
Hung with the thugs
Wouldn't think cause of my IQ
I sold drugs just to bubble and buy food
And blow bud
High school was different
A lot more attention
Every day played hooky
I was hardly in attendance
Always in some mischief
Until I got religious
Selling bean pies, spent time with the minister
And that lasted about a year
Before you know it I was back maneuvering with my peers
Met Hec Saprano at the age of sixteen
Was just a lil nigga with big dreams
It was '06 when I first hit the scene
Rocking shows without my team
When people always said I was a star
Can't believe that I made it this far
Now the boy meets the world

[Hook]
Now you've come so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world
Now you've come so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world

Now you've come so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world
Now you've come so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world (It's time to see the world)

[Verse One]
Swear I can't figure why
My brothers sell 'caine
To survive in these times, I don't know who to blame
Could blame the media, like
They're the reason I might
Just start a revolution
Know the devil recruitin'
They got us overseas
Killin' people that bleed
The same color as your brother but we too blind to see
We're very much the same
Despite what you believe
Know we can make a change
But it's the same old song
Song, song, song, song, song, song, song, song, song
Said it's the same old
Song

[Hook]
Now if we took a little time
Swallowed all our pride
We could fix the situation
But it's the same old song
The same old song
Now if we took a little time
Took a look inside
We could stop killing each other
But it's the same old song
The same old song

[Verse Two]
Yea!
I sit back in a daze
Swear the world's insane
Get so high I could fly but I'd rather escape
Find my oasis in the most exotic of places
Wish I had the solution to these problems we facing
They got us overseas
Killing people that bleed
The same color as your brother but we too blind to see
We're very much the same
Despite what you believe
Know we can make a change
But it's the same old song
Song, song, song, song, song, song
Said it's the same old song
Song, song, song, song, song, song
Said it's the same old song

[Hook]
Now if we took a little time
Swallowed all our pride
We could fix the situation
But it's the same old song
The same old song
Now if we took a little time
Took a look inside
We could stop killing each other
But it's the same old song
The same old song
