[Intro]
Picture me giving a damn (picture me)
Picture me giving a damn, I said never

Yeah, attack the block, attack the block (yeah, yeah)
Talib Kweli, Z-Trip 'A' ('A' 'A')
With the wisdom of a veteran, fire of a rook
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my crew, man, put that on everything man
Put that on everything
What you got to put up?
Put it up (put it on)

Nobody fucking with the crew that I fuck with
Nobody fucking with the crew that I fuck with
Nobody fucking with the crew that I fuck with
I can tell you get disgusted
Nobody fucking with the crew that I fuck with
I can tell you get disgusted with the crew that you stuck with

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
We do it like it's nothing, while your movement is suspect
You screaming "Aflac" cause you duck sick
Imperial nigga who gon' body the track and put the fear in you
Asking you, if you can feel it, I'm being literal
Up against the side of your temple, we getting spiritual
This the people's army, you niggas ain't pass the physical
Harder than a criminal, pardon you if you stayin'(?)
The market is full of bulls, I'm smarter than your average bear
My spirit is living proof
I be scaring 'em in the booth
They playing that truth or dare, but I dare 'em to tell the truth
I'm getting long in the tooth, but still here
While these dudes is faker than their veneers
Ain't making it past a year
Yeah, social assassin
Nigga, curb your enthusiasm
Caught up in the special effects, homie, that's movie magic

[Verse 2: John Forte]
I shoot frames in the magic hour
Life's on over blast, self contained
Grey matter, like it's overcast
Ask nothing, I don't talk too much
Then again, ask around that comes with cost and such
Throw the curve and I adjust my swing
Batters up, I strategize and avoid all ducks
I'm mad enough, you talk foolish
Your love of money is apart of something non-higher
Dance around you dudes like a bonfire
Get your weight up and your mixtapes up
Kweli, sound the alarm, my inner beast wakes up
I'm from the great-era, that you [?] your [?] flow
You still asleep, I serve from Oslo to Moscow
Go [?] [?] [?]
My lady pearl, Turkish, so we [whirl?] with the [dervish?]
Education make the nervous, they stuck on lames
Read a book, and you will know my name

[Verse 3: Posdnous]
I'm somewhere between growth and greed
Cash in hand knowledge in the book I read from
Y'all all been from the installments
Of real skill hold steady even when the earth shake [s...?]
Jealousy and hate never found [b?] [i?] [me?]
But hearts can be cold from young emcees playing bold
Yo, but haven't you heard? Your words rhyme
But my rhymes the word
Along with wit, the opposite gender want to render themselves caught
Like ladybugs in my palm, my progress is apart of my process
Mandatory sweat like a fat nigga with breast
Just a fighter who is beneath the brawl
With the promiscuous game that came to fuck us all
So when you need to make the [call?] know who to trust
That's plug to the one that's it, that's enough

[Verse 4: Skyzoo]
They looked at me as a hybrid
[Over?] guns and butter like you see what the [sty?] did
Being a block away had us driveling by big
Now they saying I write like I reached up and rhymed his
Sky is beyond measure like my speech [all leather?]
You peons could get peed on together
My pre days was for hardaway, G and whatever
My teammates had nas tapes, and heat on the dresser
Raised by it, made by it ---cradle to grave by it
All we seeing is a rover, and tucking away inside it
Fly guy etiquette, P.R.P, 'S'in' it
And blue and orange everything, like we all, we reppin', what ha'
[All of those models ????????]
They be automatic mouth, call that iPhone Siri
I'm as heavy in the south as I am in the 'K'
[Come through your palm is your hand is a wave???]

[Verse 5: Rubix]
Dem Wan' compete with us,completely nut you must have lost your senses
Not to mention man, running shit in this dimension
Guns and Spit, man none of it can touch the Kid
Especially when I'm running with, high-level sentences
Annexing this is vexing, further more it's just disgusting
Make them sick, the way I kick, Bars, percussion
Your head rushing
Plus, I'm busting melons like Gallagher
Not even a challenger to the simplest listener
Given the circumstance, call your commissioner
Got protection for your weak rendition of what you call a verse
A chick will pull from her purse, that Rubix is the worse
Disrespect how your crew loving my words
Love how I swerve, making niggas jump for the curb
They only reckless in the burbs, look in they eyes
Everything just start to slur
Grab the hand of your girl, about to earl
Make her sick with sugar, giving necklaces and pearls

[Verse 6: Fashawn]
Like Rich Wright, I write a classic like rite of passage
When I recite a passage, shit, I type on the average
Grab a mic and dismantle it, methods of a mechanic
Manic, necessary you panic [I call an ambulance of my insomnia?]
I might overdose on ambient mixing weed with a cancer stick
Increasing my chances I got a lot of living to do before I diminish
Like I'm sprinting to my finish in [line?] limit
Rhyme chemist all I'm missing is a dime misses
Compositions like do or die missions
Once I step inside the [mind] entrance
Old school like niggas who call nines biscuits
New school like buying Nicky Minaj tickets
Is it a crime that I'd rather listen to Rah Digga
A fly nigga with big dreams of boast
'L' - 'B's' to smoke, sixteens to quote
[Rich means of dope?]
