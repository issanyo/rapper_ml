[Verse 1-Fashawn]
Shots trickle down the block
It’s surrounded with cops
And paramedics, everybody on their front lawn
So I took caution, scoped the scenery out
Look to my left and see my nigga's moms
Tears rolling down her face, I knew somethin' was wrong
Cause usually her demeanor was calm and she hysterical
Spotted the body bag, it’s when I did the math
They took her only son, he was all she had
And that was my nigga, so I gotta ride
Made a phone call, somebody gotta die
Leave more yellow tape than Columbine
Catastrophic like when two missiles collide

[Hook-Fashawn]
You can feel it in your chest, seconds away from death
Nigga take a deep breath, hope you wearin' a vest
Cause when them bullets fly there ain't gone be nothin' left
Nigga now breathe in
Now breathe in
Breath in
Breathe in
Breathe out

[Verse 2-Bravo]
My nigga busted in the crib, head throbbin' and shit
He got his dome split, strong ?????????
I called the ambulance, my baby mama all in the mix
She on her cell phone talkin' her shit we gotta handle this
Before the sun up, they probably think we finna run up
Until I put the gun up, and leave them niggas done up
Revenge is a muthafucka, no matter who involved
Shootin him, shootin yall, hit they block
Seen the lady, she was 'bout 46
She told her son, "goodbye" with a hug and a kiss
Waited til she inside, then my niggas rode by
Hit that nigga with the 4-5, let him know it's live muthafucka

[Hook-Bravo]
You can feel it in your chest, seconds away from death
Nigga take a deep breath, hope you wearin' a vest
Cause when them bullets fly there ain't gone be nothin' left
Nigga now breathe in
Now breathe in
Breath in
Breathe in
Breathe out

[Verse 3-Fashawn]
Never thought that I would be a killer
Now I'm in the Chevy with my finger on the trigger
Drunk with revenge, you can smell it on my breath
Dressed in all black as I ride through the 'jects
Heart beatin' fast, palms full of sweat put my foot on the gas
Hopin' for the best, prepared for the worst
Hand on the tech, itchin' to let it burst, hopin' that it connect
(where the fuck is these niggas at?)
Spotted 'em, but they ain't see us
Hopped out the Chevy, then we got at 'em
One of them ducked, the other one caught one in the rib
Thinkin' to myself, "these niggas can't live"
Ugh

[Hook-Fashawn]
You can feel it in your chest, seconds away from death
Nigga take a deep breath, hope you wearin' a vest
Cause when them bullets fly there ain't gone be nothin' left
Now breathe in
Now breathe in
Breath in
Breathe in
Breathe out
