[Intro]

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Girls'd give an arm and a leg for a piece of my heart
Is it my good looks or is it my art?
Is it my charm, reason they can't stay still
Or is it the fame, maybe it's the mass appeal
Last year I was too short, or I was too skinny
Too something, let's be for real
Now you wanna hang, you know, laugh and chill
See me and my chick in ice grills
Here's a cold shoulder, how it feel?
Some emotions can't be concealed
You just mad cause I ain't tripping off you
Out with the old, in with the new

[Hook: Adele]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

[Bridge: Fashawn]
Can't see the ex, can't leave him alone
She cry, she just mad because I moved on
Girls wanting me now that didn't want me before
I just gotta believe, just keep down on the low

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
These days, she walks around
All by herself, head face-down
You look so blue, what happened to that smile?
Heard I was on a row wiling out
City to city, so many ladies in the crowd
Time of my life, I got no reason to frown
Got a new chick so I ran and raved
See you on the streets and I don't even wave
Reason I left, you ain't know how to behave
This is the aftermath, what a mess we've made
Damn, it's evident we're through
When the shit gone my left, it could have been you

[Hook]

[Outro: Fashawn]
You could be next so you better behave
I mean I could be gone today
You could be next so you better behave
I don't know why, I just feel that way
You could be next so you better behave
I mean I could be gone today
You could be next so you better behave
I don't know why, I just feel that way

Sometimes, I just, I just feel that way. I don't why it is. That's just me
