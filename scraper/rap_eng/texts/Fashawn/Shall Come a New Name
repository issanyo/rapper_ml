[Verse 1]
Bad as you call up my law a crisis cool
Long as you ain’t livin’ a lawless life, be fooled
By the excitement, the broads, the hype, the jewels
That’s translucent, guard your sight
We move militant-like, on or off the mic, I’m solid
Niggas salute my integrity, strength, and knowledge
Some consider me a poet, a prince, a prophet
It was written I would arrive, hold the game hostage
For as long as possible preaching the new gospel
You can do what you can, I do what I gots to
I do what I feel like, no different in real life
No skinny jeans with Nikes, more like steel pipes
And gats, razor under the tongue rap
Illustrate the feeling of a nigga who pumps crack
Writing ink on this page, ‘til it sink in his veins, uh
Witness the shiver when you mention my name, simple and plain
It’s the F

[Verse 2]
I’m dangerous ‘cause I’m solid, never know when I’m comin’
Out the sky I plummeted, people shoutin’, runnin’ for they life
Most likely ‘cause my aura’s too bright
I blind anyone in my sight, nonbeliever or hype
Try and compete if you like, this is deeper than rap
No, it’s ether, ‘fore you even put the needle to wax
Not a follower either but a leader, in fact
I figure if someone teach ‘em, we could keep it intact
The game fucked up, it need a messiah
Better yet, it need a rebel who gon’ start up a riot
From Memphis to Minnesota, Texas to Pensacola, I’m rollin’
Congregatin’ a coalition of soldiers
And I ain’t headin’ home until my mission is over
You can sit on the sofa; me, I’ll be on the frontline
Where many men got slain, they blood in my veins
When I’m gone, you’ll remember my name, simple and plain
It’s the F
