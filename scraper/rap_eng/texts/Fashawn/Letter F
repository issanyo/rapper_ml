[Sample]
I think somebody is coming is coming in here now, lets see whom it is. Because in the next few fragments, the letter F will be featured. Listen now to the letter F

[Intro]
I'd like to introduce myself
I be the, your majesty
The Tsar
Master of the ceremony
Master of any occasion

[Verse 1]
What would the alphabet be without the F?
Or the G when the the letters are supreme
I grew up the be the father of my cypher of MCs
My sons and daughters needed diapers
I plant seed all across the atlas
As far as these rap kids, baby paw was active
Left a lot of ink on a lot of sheets
Gave birth to a new me every few weeks
Why? Everybody wanna be the F
Please, just be yourself, that's what I suggest
Jesus Christ the young buck's nice when I clutch mics
Set fire to niggas like stuffed pipes
The rugged and rough type
Strutting and scuffed Nikes
Gutter but I always had a lust for the lush life
I turn iron to gold like an alchemist
Nigga there's only one F in the alphabet

[Sample]

[Hook]
It be the F-A crooked letter
Who you know do it better
You ain't gotta spell the rest
Just call me the letter F
Once again
It be the F-A crooked letter
Who you know do it better
You ain't gotta spell the rest
Just call me the letter F

[Verse 2]
As if it be any better than the sixth letter
When will he slip? Never
Who mislead 'em Huh?
Twist letters
Passing spliffs with my big bredren
High enough to kiss the heavens
Stick figure, dick bigger than Nick's cannon
Plenty chickens I did damage, the kids manage
T o blow up despite
The fact  had to grow up in the home of the three strikes
Where no one succeeds
It's like I was one out of a hundred
Motherfuckers who had got just what in wanted in life
I had the hunger
To be unstoppable, conquer every obstacle
Accomplish the impossible
Partner I got a lot to lose
Too much love, too much pride
Way too much pressure for just one guy
Soul of the west, behold it's the best
Master of the ceremony better known as the F
It's like that and uh
