[Verse 1]
If you wanna know, I'm the one you and your man should fear
Bring the champ out, the champ is here
My momma should have named me Victor
Cause victory is all I see
When I look in the mirror, couldn't be clearer
Uh, undisputed, youngest to do it
Nice with the jab like Tim Bradley
Any weight-class, light or heavy I be ready
You rhymers ain't even kinda deadly
Follow the medley
My entourage in the V.I swallowing Belve'
Here's a toast to living young and wealthy
And for the record I never lost
Gotta respect the God
I'm dealing bars like a deck of cards

[Hook]
Uh, I will not lose
And I never been beat
Big or small knock you off of your feet
Boy I'm a champion (What?)
A champion (What?)
If I can't do it then it can't be done
I got the heart of a fighter I can conquer anything
Plus I know my way around the ring
Boy I'm a champion (what?)
A champion (what?)
If I can't do it then it can't be done

[Verse 2]
This here simple and plain
Put the pen in the page
In the winter I train
Scribbling sentences in soft sand
100 miles, like I'm jogging the cross lane
Golden child
Or better yet a king, [Ima headed from the scene]
Show respect, I say hello to my cherry red beam
Like rring! Like Petey wanna sing
Me and my Valentin on a  mission for green
My right hook nice, but the left will make 'em lean
Bet I bring him to his knees
Something you never seen
In a circle of winners, they never mention you
Must I remind them I'm invincible

[Hook]
