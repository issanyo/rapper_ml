[Intro]
Once again you rocking with the kid Fashawn
Mick Boogie, Terry Urban
They can't hold me back this time baby
It's Fashawn
I still don't get the respect I feel like I properly deserve
But it's all love
Feeling good this time around
I'm back, yeah

[Verse 1]
Growing up
All I knew was Ice T
DJ Quick, 501 and White T's
Ben Davis, Ice Cube, D-R-E
Chronic Smoke, Doggystyle that's 93
Dog Pound CPT to Long Beach
All the while they overlooked the FC
Cen Cal, ? to PA
Forgotten heroes that was raised around my way
And never got what they deserved
Converted to flipping herb
Wonder what would happen if they woulda got heard
Would my city be on top
Would they still be on the block
Would they have went bankrupt instead of investing in stocks
The legacy of them and I'm just paying homage
Valley of the kings and we need to be acknowledged
Diamond in the dirt, you can't stop from shining
And these labels have the nerve to say they ain't signing

[Hook] x2
What goes around
Comes right back
So you better learn how to act cuz
What goes around
Comes right back to you
You reach what you sold times two

[Verse 2]
They say the new West is packed envisioned
B-L-U I wonder why I'm never mentioned
My shoes tied so if it sounds like I'm tripping
I pack my bags ready to pay the world a visit
They look inside, criticize me cuz I'm different
Couldn't get signed off of that fly shit I was scribbling
How many MC's I gots to burn
Before they stop telling me it's not your turn
I just brush it off
Far as labels fuck 'em all and that's from the heart
Keep it rough rugged and raw
I remained, Shawn with or without an applause
They can't contain what's coming out of these jaws
Go hard, game of life, new deck of cards
If I play it right I might become a star
But whats fame a few chains a couple broads
A contract to spend money that ain't yours

[Hook] x2
