I'm a traveling man, baby. You gotta respect, gotta accept it. I'm on the go, man. The world is calling. Check it out

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Late night, I would write
See the world through my composition, thirsty
Stay strong in the face of adversity
Now my rhymes took me further than I imagined
Torin, Atlanta, Sicily, Manhattan, Staten
Island right back to the Valley
Just to show em how we do in central cali, my home
On the map now, they tell me sit in the throne
I tell â€˜em I'm not concerned with the crown or the robe
Just wanted to meet the world, become a man on my own
And I did, now the name's household, Santiago
CA get hot, as I ran I hit Chicago
It's the heart that guides me, my mind just follows
I go where the wind takes me
Samsonite bag full of clothes
Like Jack hit the road
To the next city
Fuck it, let's travel the globe
Luggage already packed
Who knows when I'll be back

[Hook: Fashawn]
They say I'm a rolling stone, where I rest my head is my home
I let it be known that I'm a Samsonite man, yeah I'm a Samsonite man

[Verse 2: Blu]
I was reflecting where I been and realized there wasn't nowhere
Back home looking at life in one long stare
There comes a time in every man's mind he gotta get out
Get something, bring back something, don't sit around
Slumped, blunt in your hand, running from what, living for what
Parents, so you can fry they can front
Like your peace but you keep the distance
Cause your piece of mind is so small
Giving the attention to y'all
Because they listening
Listen, I'm just one reflection
You see me on stage and think of God reflecting
But see I'm really just John, look my passport says so
Folks say I'm retro and I guess so
Bag over my shoulders no pack of clothes on the metro
Alone again looking out the window at the road again
Ask myself why I left home to roam
When I've never been home or to Rome
But I'm gone again

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
To the fans that supported me when I was down
Said I went Hollywood cause I don't come around
On the road seems like I'm always out of town
I could even reach the globe or keep it underground
Everyday is a journey, I'm just trying to find my way
Left teardrops on my girl pillowcase
My unc' said we ain't got no time for that
Big sis said make sure your mind intact
It get lonely on the road don't forget about home
Got to know where you been to know where you going
Everything changes, before you know it
You in the mirror realizing you getting older
I never thought that I would make it out the F
Got the respect that I ain't expect
Last night, can't remember where I slept
One city at a time then it's on to the next

[Hook]

[Outro]
So on that note, I'mma pack my bags
Hit the road, yeah, I'm gone
Peace
