[Verse 1: Skizzmynig]
I remember days I was down in the dumps
I would just sleep, I was slumped
No cheese, so I wouldn't travel
Real life, yea it was dismantled
But I figured this writing was free
So free I could really be me
I picked myself up in the streets
Okay I tested the waters
Yea with 2 feet
Fell in too deep
The grind kinda sweet
Calculator app and I'm trappin’
You lazy boys all want a fraction
A piece of my pie that ain't happenin’
I'm callin the shots I'm the captain
You're the last one on the draft pick
Nobody wants you it's cool (cool)
Step up your skills and do you (you)
You'll thank me later, can't lose (lose)
Yea now I'm up (up)
For all the days I was snoozed
You're wack, yea you kick it with loo-zers’
I've been observing the greats (greats)
Filling up calendar dates (dates)
Up late yea the wolves are just howlin’
No food, my stomach was growlin’
For these dreams yea I been prowling (prowling, yea)
Now I’m spending my time
With people who have what I want
You live and you learn pass it on (pass)

[Chorus: Skizzmynig]
Go yard Big Ben to AB
Go yard yea Tom Brady
Goyard bag for my baby

Go yard Big Ben to AB
Go yard yea Tom Brady
Goyard bag for my baby
Goyard Goyard

[Post Chorus: Skizzmynig]
I remember days
I didn't pick up the phone
I don't got time to explain
I needed time on my own, yea
I needed time on my own
I needed time on my own
I needed time on my

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I remember days
Penny pinching
I ain’t have a Benji pitchin
Nickels on city benches
Dreaming of plenty riches
Gucci and Fendi stitches Goyard
Tented Benz’s, czar, no Jimmy Henchmen
From rags to living regal
Bad bitch wit’ a ego (classy)
She’ll put on the Fash, then switch to Migos
Use to keep a hoodrat was good at stackin’ pringles
Ain’t have a platinum singles
Just had a pot to cook in
I used to Poverello
Now I do Montebello
And I get a lot of hellos
From the projects fello
My partners is poppin metal
You probably not as ghetto
And when it comes to product
Santiago know how to pedal
Motherfuck a designer bag
I’d rather buy a pack (buy a pack)
I’d rather buy a Rari’
You rather ride the fax
You got your chain snatched
I had to buy it back (I had to buy it back)
You want to claim king
Where your empire at (what the fuck)
N*ggaaaaaaa’
