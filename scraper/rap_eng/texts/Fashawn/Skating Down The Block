[Hook]
Skating down the block eighth in my sock
Grizzly city boys any day you can watch
Skatin down the block eighth in my sock
Grizzly city boys any day

Skatin down the block eighth in my sock
Grizzly city boys any day you can watch
Skatin down the block eighth in my sock
Grizzly city boys any day
(Bear Gang)


Grizzly city bosses living lawless
Selling 8's and O's off of the cordless
Skatin down the block 3 point (whoop) in my sock
In addition to this knot

[Verse 1]
Full of twenties a couple Lincolns
Venice beach I made a left from Lincoln
Money on my mind you know what I'm thinking
GCK in my paper and you know what I'm drinking
2 cups 1 quart and a gang of G's
Khaki shorts mother fuck your favorite jeans
My skater bitch don't rock Maybelline
Listen to Frank Ocean, Rage Against the Machines
I let her back up then I dick her down
Hop on my white wheels then I hit the town
When she awake I'm know where to be found
Out making my rounds what's the price on a pound

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I hit the studio illest shit I ever wrote (ever wrote)
No hustle why they forever broke
Boy, I'm like the truest shit you never spoke (never spoke)
The best weed you'll ever smoke, F
I'm much popular from my product
In my P.J's uh no Pajamas
(Skatin down the block)
So Ain't no telling where you find 'em
All for the love of the Bill, Hilary Rodham
Any day you can watch 'em
Stuff an eigth in my sock and make my way to your projects
Take the cake out your pocket
You know what the cost is, You niggas lost it
Stick up kids, nigga empty the closet
Shoe box, no shoes, hoes on the track ...Pro Tools
Bad bitch but her paper good
Grizzly Gang hibernating in your neighborhood
[Hook 2x ]
