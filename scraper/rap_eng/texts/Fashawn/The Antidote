(“Don’t get too close because you might get shot”)

[Verse 1]
I be splittin’ these rappers in half like cantaloupes
Exposing ‘em, the game is infected, I’m the antidote
Radical, untouchable, as far as my attitude
Latitude, that of a G4, it’s magical
It’s Barnum & Bailey when I go hard up in breakbeats
It sound like I’m lettin’ off an AR-15
My regime is deadly as Berettas, battle whoever
Take it back to Rock Steady, the new era
Molding a generation of Kings like Coretta
Scott, when I rock, I’m just ruffling niggas’ feathers
I’m hot, sit and watch as what I say manifest
Take caution before you say I’m the best
My believe it and start jottin’ some ether
Have you jumpin’ off the bleachers
That’s what I call “teen spirit”
Mean lyrics I deliver and paint the scene vivid
A thousand words and you still couldn’t get the picture
Just like a pill, give it and hit it, and it’ll hit ya
My penicillin is hittin’ so hard, ill niggas keepin’ it real wit’cha
You ain’t even notice but our run a little bigger
Yo Alc, blow the muthafuckin’ horns when I’m finished
The antidote…the antidote…’Shawn got the antidote
Pick up the antidote…’Shawn got the antidote

[Verse 2]
Now, like it, inject this in your veins
It’s the F-A-crooked-letter embedded in your brain
Mic shredder, et cetera, drove the veterans insane
It was inevitable, somebody tell ‘em why I came
Why you better buy an umbrella, get ready for my reign
Expand your empire, explore new terrain
Hope I never expire, that’ll be the day
If I fali, at least I did it my way—go to hell
Hip-hop is in a state of 9/11
Don’t waste your time trying to find a medic
I designed this solution for those diagnosed with rhyme flu
I really think there’s something in the music
‘Shawn got the antidote … the antidote … ‘Shawn got the antidote
The antidote
