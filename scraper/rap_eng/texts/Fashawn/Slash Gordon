[Verse 1: Fashawn]
You niggas sick, but it's not the measles
I'm slangin' hard rock nigga, flock of seagulls

[Murs]
When this shit drop it's gonna shock the people
Like Barack hit the block lettin' off the Eagle

[Fashawn]
I even had that white boy, Ben Stiller
Chinese minx, call her chinchilla

[Murs]
When you drop that shit, niggas didn't feel ya'
That whack shit didn't phase me, but it did kill ya'

[Fashawn]
Swear to God I never needed a rap manual
All I needed was some Mary Jane and some Jack Daniels

[Murs]
On my Mama, I always been a rap vandal
Smack a whack nigga to death with an axe handle

[Fashawn]
While you sittin' around lollygaggin'
I'm rollin' chronic out the bag - put the molly shag in

[Murs]
Man these niggas out here hardly rappin'
I come through and bless the mic In a godly fashion

[Fashawn]
So, necessary that you respect a Don
Especially if he's on another echelon

[Murs]
I come through, with nothing but the freshest on
Wear it once and then it's trash, like a Ke$ha song

[Fashawn]
Yeah! Not an Ave you never catch us on
You niggas is cosmetic as Revlon

[Murs]
I was the broke kid that never had a Megatron
Stole it from the rich kids, that's why we couldn't get along

[Interlude]
[M]Look, Fash, nigga
[F]Whaddup Murs?
[M]You been leading of this whole hit man, you started the whole shit
[M]But now I'm gonna go first
[F]Aight, well do you thing homie
[F]Go in

[Verse 2: Murs]
West Coast originator, never been an imitator
Full-blown, acetone microphone disintegrator

[Fashawn]
Uh, I get ignorant in the midst of danger
Inventive, considered the innovator

[Murs]
Where I'm, from we don't screw and chop shit
They come through wearin' red and blue where we pop clips

[Fashawn]
Uh, and I be higher than a cockpit
Let the chop spit hollow tips out his top lip

[Murs]
This is the sound of an underground renegade
Who wears a crown and isn't down to catch any fade

[Fashawn]
Bwah, you ain't ballin' go get a bit of change
Smooth criminal, hit a nigga through his window pane

[Murs]
And I was put here to put fear in suss niggas
Nobody shook here, we don't give a fuck, nigga

[Fashawn]
Yeah! Drug dealers, slup peelers
Mention it to my mug nigga, fuck Twitter

[Murs]
Gangbangers, thug niggas, nerds to the geeks
All respect the way I put these words to the beat

[Fashawn]
In other words he's a beast every verse he completes
Bad bitches, actresses, even birds give him beak

[Murs]
And the music that we make help the kids in the ghetto grow
Fightin' for they're freedoms so they keep up out the federal

[Fashawn]
Uh, the name's embedded somebody let 'em know
Always stay perpetual flow, so I forever glow

[Murs]
Fashawnin' on these niggas, straight up out the FC
Catch me with the baddest bitch burnin' up the best trees

[Fashawn]
Or probably on some jet-skis, I hustle collect cheese
Last time you saw a check was on your SB's

[Murs]
Yeah! Respect over everything
Murs and Fashawn, bet you've never seen a better team
