[Verse 1: Fashawn]
I used to play the corner store market
Now I plan on cornering the market
Call the coroner I sent, 4 about that lock
And I hit you and your whore in y'all apartment
Leave nothing but y'all corpses on the carpet
I spark it, got the arsenal of an arsonist
A narcissist hardly concerned with these other artistsss
This ain't a rap it's a biography
Yeah, copy writ in case they copy me
S. Leyva, the F's top player
Respect I hater, left side's greatest
Yeah, angel with a battery in his halo
In another tax bracket your majesty gettin' mayo
Say bro, tell these pussy niggas lay low
Fuego, that's all you feel when that AK blow
Yeah, just for playin with my pesos
Paragraphs picture perfect I paint 'em like play-doh
Twice baked you can call me Mr. Potato
Shawn Stacks I move them blocks like legos

[Hook: Fashawn]
Hola Santiago! (2x)
Nah I ain't playing grab this cannon and I aim it
Give 'em something strictly for the gangsters
They hollerin' out Hola Santiago! (2x)

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I used to have dreams of bagging an R&B bitch
Now I'm thinking Victoria Secret
Something foreign I can creep with
Through the streets of California for the weekend
Monday morning I'll ignore it, Diadora's hit the cement
Which means that I'm on my toes
To all these niggas and all these hoes
I got my friends and I got my foes
Bank account not enough 0's
Too much weed in my lungs, new tags on my clothes
Full clip in my chopper, boy I wouldn't come close
Fuck around and be ghost just for running around that coast
Westbound, tech rounds, real shit the sound of that toast
Praise due to the most, but still I brag and I boast
And it's bear gang over everything I live and die for that oath
They say hola Santiago while I'm smoking my cubano
El Chapo, sippin' mojitos out in Cabo
You ain't about gettin dinero get out the way loc
Only real niggas on my payroll

[Hook: Fashawn]
Hola Santiago! (2x)
Nah I ain't playing grab this cannon and I aim it
Give 'em something strictly for the gangsters
They hollerin' out Hola Santiago! (2x)
