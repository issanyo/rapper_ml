Sermons inspired by the streetlife
Syringes, police lights,  S-class and F-type cash
Can get the set hype fast
Maneuvering like we moving Peruvian
It's nothing new to me and my  hooligans
Way too many chains
I ought to give one to Vito
Bitches giving brain just cause they saw me on Vevo
My last name alone, I might get hit with the rico
Bout to cop something exterior Tampico
On the gram like
God damn, look at me though
Little nigga with the big ego
Sean, call me papi, a don
Try to stop me, you gone
When them cannons flash
Like paparazzi it's on
And never off
Until one of us  dead and gone
Your head in Midian
Your legs in Lebanon
Traumatized by lies my teacher
Told me in the class of my own
Who knew it would be this be lonely
Think Left Eye on Death row
The nina on me
Fash, you rich why you still drinking that OE?
Shatter proof
And I smoke shatter too
Hit the dispensary a few dabs, that'll do
My attitude
Rather rude
I climbed the ladder
Now I'm at a different latitude
Foes, I had a few
Hoes, I had a crew
[?] an avenue
Now I'm known international
I take you on a journey through these lines
Too trill
Probably need an attorney when I rhyme
New Steel out the alley
Emerge, keep it mine
Merciless ,outline them, that's murder by design
Kevlar under the car heart
Criminal contour talk about product I sold more
They wanna know how much this dope cost
How much the flow cost
Am I in Illuminati and so forth
Rich rapper, clip packer, dick fatter, rip bladders
All that bitch did was piss after
Ditch her like Wiz did Amber
Or the money did hammer
She feel like she got her ribs batted
It's a major event
Whenever I'm in the building
Ball like children, savages out the wilderness
[?]
[?]
The habbitat will turn you into a cannibal
Time in the cage will turn you in a animal
This ain't the blueprint, it's the manual
And the truth is I dismantle you
Could have fled, got chubby made it my [?]
Mics I'm large
This gang is calm
But physically small
I make Lil Wayne look tall
I'm dangerous, dog
[?] Balboa came to brawl
It's about money
Better hear my name involved
Spit acid, you act like you can't dissolve
As much as I gave, I don't know what you take me for
Thank the lord
About to his the bank I'm bored
Exchange the currency I made on tour
Then hit [?] for filet mignon
Got money on repeat like my favorite song
More proverbs than a page of psalms
Please, don't make a pimp raise his palm
My deal, I ink that like baby's [?]
You Rihanna niggas keep your navy calm
I got a regime
Know what I mean
Out of your league
Ever since The Ecology
Who said I wasn't in the streets
Last time I heard that, I was in the streets
Revved up lit few thousand on the [?]
Twenty deep in public housing when we meet
Yall niggas politicking about property
Eating polly seeds, the last of a dying breed
Air hose on the chopper to let the iron breathe
Disappear before I hear the pig siren scream
Money made a young nigga emotionless
I'm more focused now that po legit, I'm holding
Couple of meetings with my attorney
Heathens do not concern me
Left the game I don't need the jersey I sold it
Kept one to frame
Nor my hungerpains
Just gluttony for the gang
The hustle remain
I'm such a son of a crip
As a younging was lit
When the spring fall, summer I clung to the strip
Work in my pocket
Blunt on my lips
With a handful of youngins who want get rich
The shit I utter so gutter
I've done it again, pump [?]
In case you was wondering how my summer was spent
Mumbled my way to London to Dublin to Lens
Huddle up in the Benz
Hungry for ends
Life in the spotlight on
In front of a lens
Uh, I kept it a hundred
Ain't nothing pretend
Sweet chick for the waffles and wings, opulence
Every member of the maffia's dream
Preposterous how I migrated to Mass Appeal
And that was ill
As Malcolm going to Mekka
The outcome was unexpected
Could you believe that I'm still on tour?
So many casualties
And they still want war
Even if I touch a billie, Imma still want more
Your rhymes Honda Accord to a Bentley Azure
Versus mine, certainly
Not ink in your pen, that's mercury
Those rhymes designed for nurseries
I'm in full effect, operating correct
Should have rated it R but I rated it F
All yall in debt for not paying respect
Mister worldwide by way of the west
You rather I pay you a visit
Or you pay me a check
Some say I'm the best
I say I'm possessed
By the spirit of Big
Either one
Big L, Biggie Smalls, Big Bank,  Big pun
One
Nigga
