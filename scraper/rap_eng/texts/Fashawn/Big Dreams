[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Now I was
Sitting on a mountain of dilemmas
Guzzling 40 ounces to the liver
Thinking about my life my life
How I was living in strife
We would be out all night
In front of my building
In the gutter the impoverished civilians
It was life or death
I was just trying to make a killing
Jobs wasn't hiring
Mama lost her mind again
Daughter needed diapers
And daddy needed a Vicodin
Baby girl getting older
And it won't be long
Til she got the weight of the world on her shoulders
Try to be calm
This chronic prevent me from doing niggas bodily harm
Gotta remind me I'm Shawn
Cuz sometimes I be lost
Fantasizing about cars
Go to sleep with a picture of a Maserati on my wall
From them projects and buildings
To a yacht and some slippers
Had them Christopher Wallace intentions
I had to get it

[Hook (2X)]
Big dreams, big dreams the whole city was mine
Big dreams, big dreams, Benz, beepers and 9's
Big dreams, big dreams, the only limit's the sky
Got me feeling like the world is mine
Now close your eyes

[Verse 2]
Now everybody has a dream
But not every man has a plan
For some it becomes a reality
Slight chance but hey
You, you take it for what it's worth
Even if it just so happens your face end up in the dirt
Where I'm from the definition of work
Is a zipper some purp, or a key of that girl
I swear the city's bizerk
Wanted to travel the world
Leave a dent on this earth
I guess a nigga in search
Always trying to find an exit
Was tired of living reckless
In my mind envisioned myself driving in a Lexus
Uh, you'll know ya nig got it made
When the cops never raid and the crib got a maid
Why life as a shorty gotta be fucked up?
I just want what's mine I ain't asking for much
I mean, I had dreams and rapping was one
It was either that or ski mask and a gun
But you don't hear me tho

[Hook (2X)]

[Outro: Fashawn + J. Cole]
Know what I'm saying
Close your eyes man
Picture that man
Close your eyes and envision this
You know what I'm saying
It's the life
It's a Cole world
Big cars, expensive linen
You know what it is
Grizzly City to the Ville nigga
Real niggas connect
Know what I'm saying respect
Fayettnam all the way to Grizzly City nigga
Big Dreams
It's the F
