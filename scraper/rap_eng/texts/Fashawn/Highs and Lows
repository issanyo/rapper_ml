[Intro: Fashawn]
Uh, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
You know I live life, man
Sometimes I don't know where I'm going, man
It's hard to tell what's right and what's wrong sometimes, man
I just know I'm headed in the right direction
You know what I'm saying? Buss it, uh

[Pre-Verse: Fashawn]
All I know is that I
Wish that my life was simplified
Got my pistol [?] strapped to my side
Why I'm rolling? Don't ask me why
Don't ask me, nigga, check it out

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Could be paranoia, fame, greed, the game
Everyone claims that I've forgotten where I came from
Jealousy, anger, weed, shame
And knowing that I coulda done better, pretty old for a young fella
My watch, these chains, unnecessary, we are legendary
Bullshit becomes secondary, swear a nigga need a umbrella
For my rain on top, uh, game on lock
Drink a lotta champagne, but the pain don't stop

[Chorus: Fashawn]
But still every time that I try
It's always the same lullaby
Feeling low so I chase the high
It's like I'm in a race with time
But still every time that I try
It's always the same lullaby
Feeling low so I chase the high
It's like I'm in a race with time

[Verse 2: Solo]
Could it be nostalgia, age, monotony, change
Noise clouds my brain till I can't even hear myself think
Nothing seems to be helping, another hand dealt in
But I might fold, under pressure, pretty old for a young fella, but
In my younger days, yo, bombing up the train
Weekends whole crew drunk off Beam once again
Should I be more unashamed? Shoulda been more carefree
While everything was fun and games, nowadays I numb the pain
Self-prescribed medication got me heavily sedated
Something like David Blaine the way I'm staying so levitated
Thanks to my man, Chasm, for the patience
Though I'm prone to a moments hesitation never question my dedication

[Chorus: Fashawn (David Dallas)]
But still every time that I try
It's always the same lullaby
Feeling low so I chase the high
It's like I'm in a race with time
But still every time that I try
It's always the same lullaby
Feeling low so I chase the high (Dâ€”Dot D.A.L.L.A.S)
It's like I'm in a race with time (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: David Dallas]
Got a old head on young shoulders, feel like the only one sober
Giving everything the once over, most thoughts go unspoken
Play it close to my chest [?] try to keep my word to death
Nah, I'm not back 'cause I never left when the whole didn't give an f
U.C.K., now they're like "Seen Dave?"
Out there in B.K. tryna ring me on a prepaid, shucks
Those days are over now
I took that old phone and I've thrown it out, they don't know how
Bad [?] sound, think it's cruisy now
They just wanna play C.O.D., tryna shoot me down
This ain't no fucking game, and I'm not fucking playin'
Wise beyond my years, tryna rise beyond my peers

[Chorus: Fashawn]
But still every time that I try
It's always the same lullaby
Feeling low so I chase the high
It's like I'm in a race with time
But still every time that I try
It's always the same lullaby
Feeling low so I chase the high
It's like I'm in a race with time
