[Verse 1: Choosey]
Many drinks I'm having
Morning and even after
The evening seem like the last
Lean and repeat the pattern
And all I be is snacking
Look at these cheesy rappers
Why am I eating that shit
Look at these cheesy rappers
Why we believe in that shit
Seems [?] ashes
All on this rap magazine
Cause I ain't reading that [?]
Me and my team ain't answering
The questions about recording sessions and
My heritage
It don't even matter
Half of my people asking
Why I don't speak in Spanish
And all I ever say is
My pappy never passed it
To me and my siblings, I guess it didn't even matter
At least he copped a wedding ring
That's all I need, examples
Cause all I see is trapping
See the screens and acting
She don't believe in love and he don't think it happens
She like 'em light skinned, snap backs and tatted
She blonded from the burbs, what you mean he ratchet
You shopping got a splurge, what you mean he ratchet
She saying nigga now, and we be looking passed it
She said the n word, and blacks ain't even mad at it
Why? Cause nothing even matters

[Chorus: Ishe]
Now the skies could fall
So don't worry about me at all
I'm getting mine no time to stall
Cause nothing even matters
Now the skies could fall
So don't worry about me at all
I'm getting mine no time to stall
Cause nothing even matters
At all

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I wake up at [?]
Eggs and carne asada
Chopper under my sofa, criminals and crooked coppers
Who obviously wanna lock us
Pimps, pushers and profits
Sipping liquor that's toxic
On scales, swinging my options
Suffocating my neighborhood
Oh well
Skate shop to get the latest wood
That's on sale, only thing that mattered
A plate, a platter
Playstations, we [?]
Till our faces got fatter
What used to be important is now a thing of the passed
Cause no longer cling to the [?]
On his pap and, oh
G if you ask, it ain't easy being Fash
Or Choosey, to prevent me from crying
And I often laugh
All the way to the bank
Plenty Benjamin Franks
Plenty women to poke
Plenty players to thank, yeah
Fuck trynna please somebody else
Been on my own, all my life, now I'm just by myself
Too many things I'm not concerned with
Green eyes like Erick, all attending  my sermons
Got a lot of hoes, who cares
MJ's new pair, retro, too rare
Exile got new snares

[Chorus: Ishe]
