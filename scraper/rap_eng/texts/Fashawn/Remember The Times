[Verse 1]

I'm awakened by a knock at the window
It's one of my kinfolks
Probably the G's, They eyes stay Chinese
So I iron my jeans, Find a sweater that's mean
Whatever match the DC's
Officially 16, head full of dreams
Before Evisu jeans, a young nigga was clean
Eight backs after speeding ?, smoking and heavy breathing
Posted on the cement, ferocious when we meet up
Me and nine other ones
Some on bikes some on skateboards some didn't have either or
Still mobbin' in the streats, neckin' with no heat
'Til the big homie came with the nickel plated piece
Pulled it out his fleece, said take a peek
Then put it in my hand that's when I felt like a man
And to think about it I ain't changed
Except that tat's on the frame and oh yeah the name

[Hook] x 2
Let me know if you remember those times
If you hear it and you feel it
Just press rewind
Let's take it back

[Verse 2]
I came home gunnin' and my momma laughed
Uncle Roy grounded me for a month and a half
Sat in my room with my stereo on blast
A sock in the Aerosol can
Rap City "Tha Basement"
Swear I tickled with the flyest
Is it just me or it happen to Free and AJ
Joe Clair and Fab Five Freddy
Yo, MTV raps I watched heavily
Back then I had a crew, we was about as deep as the Wu
But, eight turned to five, some couldn't survive
Hek made his way in and said step aside
Handled b-i, I stayed on my grind
Now I'm flooding the shelf, these niggas can't shine
It's crazy how they waving at concerts
They literally created a monster
They say I'm a beast

[Hook] x 2

[Verse 3]
This kind of remind you of your first kiss don't it
Or even your first time I'll tell you 'bout mine
The best five minutes of my life
Wondering where to put it I should have kept on the lights
Picture me, white T, hanging down to my knees
With a frown on my face like this ain't me
Did whatever to stay P-A-I-D
Now I'm back to LA every week
Doing my thing
Why don't we go back
To ? overalls and corn braids
Helly Hansen jackets, Hilfiger shades
You can say I'm stuck in my ways
But I just wanna go back

[Hook] x 2
