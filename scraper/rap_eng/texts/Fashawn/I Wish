I Wish


G.O. (Verse 1)

I Wish this game wasn't so centralized in money
Sex cars and drugs has invited in all the dummies
Culture vultures scavenging  molding rap like its putty
To a money hungry bitch that's Tryna take everything from me
I Wish the muthafuckin truth came out
Cuz there a questions I want answered on some few thing out
Like how the hell can you spot an object lightyears away
But lack tools to find a missing plane at this day and age
I Wish we could erase the hate with love
Live in a world where we ain't taking blood
From the innocent due to religious beliefs and political differences
Will it end  with the Israelis and the Palestinians
I wish to get out this middle class society
I wish to get my family in Colombia out of poverty
I wish that one day I can say I over came my struggles
While no one hoped  I saw the light through the tunnel


G.O. (Hook)

I Wish for the good in life
Tryna turn my wrongs to right
From dark to bright
Before I blow the candle light
I look up and then i close my eyes
And say one day I Wish
I move along for the better
Move along towards forever
Knowing the day that my soul decides to leave from me
I left a mark that'll always be
I Wish

Oddisee (Verse 2)

Fly stones say wishful thinking can be the ending
Long as it's linked to imagination I keep defending
And keep pretending we live in a world where all can make it
I often think if we lived the war we be walking naked
You see the wish is a cloth and the cloth is a tool
And you can fix it to solve or you can floss it to food
Very small is the difference but my intentions is stitching
If not involved in the details the [?]
To fall apart at the purchase anything worth it you make it
You break it you buy it long as you trying all can improve
And I'm a testament to business with skills
I use to hope for all the best now all the best is the drill
I know the deal like we were neighbors
I go knocking for favors
You crack the door like back for more
I'm here to visit so chill
To talk politics and making mills happen from scratch
Main ingredient to this dish is a wish imagine that

G.O. (Hook)

I Wish for the good in life
Tryna turn my wrongs to right
From dark to bright
Before I blow the candle light
I look up and then i close my eyes
And say one day I Wish
I move along for the better
Move along towards forever
Knowing the day that my soul decides to leave from me
I left a mark that'll always be
I Wish

Fashawn (Verse 3)

I wish I can lead my people in a different direction
I wish Hilary don't win the election
I wish for bigger investments, unlimited blessings
I remember for how genuine when I've kept it
The listeners I've effected I Wish
I didn't need a escape I never end up property of the state
For the streets to be safe from DC to CA
Wish I ain't have to had this heat on my waist
Bringin seeds to the hate I Wish
I had a genie in a bottle a bikini model
To feed me when I'm feeling hollow what do I know
I wish my pride was easier to swallow
I hit the lotto when these demons wouldn't follow I Wish
I had something besides these memories
To resurrect me something besides this hennessy
To rewind one day I'll find serenity
Peace of mind, a sign or some kind of [?]

G.O. (Hook)

I Wish for the good in life
Tryna turn my wrongs to right
From dark to bright
Before I blow the candle light
I look up and then i close my eyes
And say one day I Wish
I move along for the better
Move along towards forever
Knowing the day that my soul decides to leave from me
I left a mark that'll always be
I Wish
