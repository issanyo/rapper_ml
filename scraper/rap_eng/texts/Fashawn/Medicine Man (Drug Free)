May be some medicine, debolishin marijuana
May be some medicine, debolishin marijuana
I'm extra key trust my pill clapper
No medaine, no no oxy cut in
This purple weed, shrimp and lobster
Onion in my pocket but I ain't pitchin them rollin
With the weezy we're smoking loaded, split full of potting
I'm burnin cookies when I'm deeping from crystal showing ugly
Keep some grizzly city can't forget what homies
Steal my money crumble like ..
At a hundred mouth for hour speed
I'll be damn if I slow down
I won't let you coward..
I seat campaign in the..loud pack this is how I speak
First class that's how I fly
In my favourite flower cream

Chorus:
Slow it by the moe, call me medicine man
Oh you ain't know the connect is my man
I keep my drugs free, drugs free
I lean drugs free, every day drugs free
Slow it by the moe, call me medicine man
Oh you ain't know the connect is my man
I keep my drugs free, drugs free
I lean drugs free, every day drugs free
Good on my funs, good in my lungs
Goo to the hood for my drugs 'cause I'm go with the plot
It's like a mack charger abusing drugs
Bound weed off the Twitter card that computer love
I'm taking green everywhere with me that computer stuff
That treat don't even know where you've been that bermude bud
Smoking them in I'm joking
'cause it's powing and I got this shit from Khaled
And I know just how to roll it
Grizzly city, smell the smoke and yall approaching
Taylor gang we're getting bucks 200 for em
Roll the weed and drink the gin and getting
All is f*cking paper when I call it doing favors
'cause I'm balling plus I'm famous

[Chorus:]
This nigga on the floor shit
Yeah man, free weed, free grass
Got smurb, jajaja
