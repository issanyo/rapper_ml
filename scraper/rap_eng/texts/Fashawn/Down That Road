You are my future, I wanna be where you are
Don’t know what to do love, cause you're so damn far
So I'm flying down that road, flying down that road
Way down that road, flying down that road
Trying to catch up to you, flying down that road
Way down that road, flying down that road
Check it out, way down that road
You got me turning on my blunt just to find you
Doing 100 and something on the highway
Not even word about the five oh
No telling the limits that I go
Still you question if I love you like I say I do
Doesn't even think a real brother capable
Of being faithful to somebody lady like
First date ask you to stay the night
Ok, maybe I was moving too fast
Or maybe I ain't able to last, foot on the gas
Shawty got me down this road
Loosing count how many miles I drove
I just need you to know
I just want you to know
You are my future, I wanna be where you are
Don’t know what to do love. cause you're so damn far
So I'm flying down that road, flying down that road
Way down that road, flying down that road
Trying to catch up to you, flying down that road
Way down that road, flying down that road
Check it out, way down that road
Trying to catch up to you, just trying to catch up to you
Just trying to catch up to you
Ain't felt a touch in a month or 2
Stuck like glue, don't know what to do
You still living life like I got nothing to loose
I never should have left you alone it's true
Now, can't wait to get back home to you
Admit, I wasn't doing what I was supposed to do
I was so confused time to show and prove
Just couldn't picture my life with a wife up in it
But tonight is different wanting a type of woman
I can't live alone I need her around
Why she had to go and flee out of town, answer that
You are my future, I wanna be where you are
Don’t know what to do love. cause you're so damn far
So I'm flying down that road, flying down that road
Way down that road, flying down that road
Trying to catch up to you, flying down that road
Way down that road, flying down that road
Check it out, way down that road
Trying to catch up to you, just trying to catch up to you
I remember when back then I was the biggest fan
She could have turned any g into a gentleman
And her and me is all we care about
Now I'm trying to figure out her whereabouts
Long road but I'm willing to drive
Just to let her know how I'm feeling inside
Guess this love is ahead of this time
More precious than everything I ever …
In the beginning I wasn't prepared to fall
Wasn't willing to bare my heart now I'm aware
I just wanna be where you are
Near or far. I don't care
You are my future, I wanna be where you are
Don’t know what to do love. cause you're so damn far
So I'm flying down that road, flying down that road
Way down that road, flying down that road
Trying to catch up to you, flying down that road
Way down that road, flying down that road
Check it out, way down that road
Trying to catch up to you, just trying to catch up to you
Bring her home man
Just trying to catch up to you
You trying to catch, … way down that road
