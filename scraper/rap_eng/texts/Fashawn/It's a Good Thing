[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Tell me, what means the world to you?
Your spouse, or your house with the gorgeous view?
Is it the sand white and the water blue?
But your priorities are out of order, true? (You've got a good thing)
In an empty pursuit of profit and respect
Preoccupied, you collect more problems to neglect
Evidently a success, and obviously depressed
But the drama, the stress, it's probably for the best
When will we all start realizing that we are blessed?
Excess expectations we accept
Let's make a bet, homie
You stay in debt, don't ya?
You take an L while your lady takes the rest
Enough is never enough, we want everything
Like every baby mama want a wedding ring
While you're stuck on this planet
Focus on what's important
And try to take nothing for granted

[Hook]
And it's all good (You've got a good thing)
Till it goes bad, till it goes bad
And it's all good (You've got a good thing)
Till it goes bad, till it goes bad

[Verse 2: Aloe Blacc]
What can I say? Good Things was my good thing
Need a dollar, got a dollar, move out the hood thing
Goodbye 12th Street and Hoover, we won't miss you
Now sirens and gangbanging teens ain't the issue
Papa's got a new bag to be concerning with
Like how my piece of the pie look when the earning's split
Season it with sugar and spice
Cause the good things I have in my life is
The butterfly in the belly of my wife
Same time, make lightning strike twice
Thunder shake me up
One hit wonder, while the world screaming "Wake Me Up"
But I'ma sleep just a little bit longer
Every night my daydreams get a little bit stronger
Every day my nightmare's worst fears subside
Three years in the making, let me swallow some pride
Got another good thing for ya, when you hear it
Hopefully it's gonna lift your spirit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Choosey]
We got simple needs and complicated means
Top Ramen in the pot again and probably all week
Bow your head and give thanks, say grace before you eat
A couple blocks down they pouring gravy on they feast
I had a complex about my family tree
My apartment complex full of convicts and fiends
Drug dealing, gunfire right across the street
We stuck inside the crib, drop and duck when them guns ring
We're dysfunctional, fussing over dumb things
Mom and Pops fighting really just because we
Ain't have the funds to be spendin' it on drugs, he
Ended up in county, we ain't seen him in a month, see?
I used to dwell on that until I felt bad
Took a look around and felt blessed to understand that
We ain't had the wealth, still we had a present Dad
Through the struggle, that's a good thing to have

[Hook]

[Outro]
Fashawn got a good thing, hey
Aloe Blacc got a good thing, hey
Choosey got a good thing, hey
Exile got a good thing, hey
Bear Gang in the house and you don't stop
Dirty Science in the house and we don't quit
Blu in the place, you don't stop
Co$$ Dollars
Johaz in the house
Adidas Cool, yo we gotta be the ultimate
