[Verse One] [Emilio Rojas]:
City lights shine in a city like mine
24/7 on an inner city like grind
Many cities like mine, bright eyes, big dreams
Tenements and skylines fight (cry) kick (scream)
Night time, dick freaks, white lines, sniff, tweak
Lifestyle frigid like an icebox, bitch freeze
Bitch please, which fiends snitch should get a bitch plee
Crisp jeans but the kids sick enough to get fleas
Mislead women, never hit these women for the prestige sinnin'
To a disease with it
Ain't no empty clinics
When we fill prescriptions for addictions
Methadone, Valium and Ritalin
Your bail out ain't hittin' us
We been in recession for years
They sent us stimulus affectin' they peers
And that's it
Look how they trickin' us with black lists
We're prisoners with our lifestyles and habits

[Chorus] [Emilio Rojas]:
We be on the ave
Backstreets, alleys and cizzurbs
Concrete slabs with the cracks and the fissures
World keeps passin' us by as it tizzurn
But we got cash not a bizzurn
We be on the ave
Backstreets, alleys and cizzurbs
Concrete slabs with the cracks and the fissures
World keeps passin' us by as it tizzurn
But we got cash not a bizzurn

[Verse Two] [Fashawn]:
Still at the bus stop
Back to the block, I ain't succeed
Baby to feed, hungry and my stomach in knots
I need money, but who doesn't since the government flop
I've reconsidered hustlin' rocks
I'll end up, like my pops
Just went back to the box for ten months
Spittin' image, hiddin' crack in my socks
What the fuck?
We on the ave
The corner, gunshots and coroners
New York, New York to sunny California
Late nights we on, same song in the mornin', no
Stayin' in the house, out on a paper route
F.C. state of mind, puffin' weed all the time
Stackin' G's on the grind
Hard to get a nine to five
First they give us the work
Then they throw us in jail
Shoebox full of money in case you need bail
I'm just a section 8 kid with a story to tell
Or a nigga with an attitude, chillin' on the avenue

[Chorus] [Emilio Rojas]:
We be on the ave
Backstreets, alleys and cizzurbs
Concrete slabs with the cracks and the fissures
World keeps passin' us by as it tizzurn
But we got cash not a bizzurn
We be on the ave
Backstreets, alleys and cizzurbs
Concrete slabs with the cracks and the fissures
World keeps passin' us by as it tizzurn
But we got cash not a bizzurn
