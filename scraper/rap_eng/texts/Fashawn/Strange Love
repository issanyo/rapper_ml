[Verse 1]
I swear love is like driving drunk on the freeway feels good but any moment you can crash
Such an adrenaline rush, hoping that it lasts
Forever but all good things become the past
Give it time, different feelings become developing
Conversations getting sour as they ever been
Yet you stick around, settle in, spending time, less chilling with the fella's , then she got your mind
I swear love is like falling on public square, everybody staring at you
You on your own little world, not caring bout a thing
You her man, she yo girl
Way past the friendship, you walking thru the mall now, holding hand and hand
Broke all your walls down,confuse who's the man, of the relationship will never go how you plan
That's all relationships will never go how you plan, go how you plan

[Hook]
Strange Love, Loving you ------, loving a little moreeeeeee'
Strange Love, Im talking bout, talking bout, talking bout Loveeeeeeeee'
Strange Love, Well I know know, love is not what it seems
Strange Love, Im talking bout, talking bout, talking bout loveeeeeeee'

[Verse 2]
Gotta swallow my guilt knowing a brotha doing wrong , being unfaithful
Do I even love her at all?
Got ma mind tangled, wanting to ditch her but its hard
She the sweetest able finding self -------------------
Like C'mon, Fas, Know you messing with other bras, and she's wrong
Might have got a couple numbers to put my hands on a snow bunny on the under
She knows me like no one else got a reason to wonder
Spend ma money on trees, could of took her to the movies
I don’t know how she tolerate it all, why I’m your favorite
Person to be around, always trying my patience
Flipping an hour later it's now to break-up
I'm tellig she got me in the trans
Had ma guards up
But little mama knock me out my pants, should of seen it
Now a day, all we do is fuzz and fight
Break-up every other night
I was told this was love is like
What is like

Loving you ------, loving a little moreeeeeee'
Strange Love, Im talking bout, talking bout, talking bout Loveeeeeeeee'
Strange Love, Well I know know, love is not what it seems
Strange Love, Im talking bout, talking bout, talking bout loveeeeeeee'

Love is like breaking up a million times
Treat her really deep, when you know she on yo mind
Like gones ----- everything is fine
Thoughts racing back and forth everythings fine
I swear love is like breaking up a million times
Thoughts racing back and forth everythings fine
On the surface

Strange Love
Man I check it
Ain't all what it seems, now
People think you can read it out of a textbook or something
Like it some with a line, you know what I mean
You gotta live it to know bout it
Speak the language
It's a complex thing
Thing you call LOVE!
