[Intro]
C-O-P-Y-C-A-T
C-O-P-Y-C-A-T

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Uh
Your flow far from authentic
Mm - you're all gimmicks
Seen too many small niggas get large
Augmented
I increase and inflict scars on all nemeses
With these thoughts I'm scribbling
Shawn the mortician it is
Critical you're style's original
Nah, folk wouldn't make it to wax - you digital
Cats bite you like the shit's allowed
I sit 'em down, show 'em how to rip a crowd
And then grip a crown
King
With this hip-hop thing
You had a fling
Me? I'm like holy matrimonies and wedding rings
Married to the craft
Your catalogue I bury in a flash
Remind me of Jim Carrey in The Mask
Perpetrating and pretending to rap
That ain't being innovative, that's identity theft, nigga
Get your own
I'm sort of like Oprah
Dropping meteors on those who mediocre

[Hook]
C-O-P-Y-C-A-T, why are you living a lie?
Everybody wanna be somebody else
When you're doing you, you don't need nobody's help
Don't be a
C-O-P-Y-C-A-T, why are you living a lie?
Everybody wanna be somebody else
When you're doing you, you don't need nobody's help
Don't be a copycat
No, don't be a copycat
Nah, don't be a *cat noise*
Don't be a copycat

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
If I wasn't the letter F
I would probably be 20syl
20 years later I'd be dropping bombs still
You honestly should pay homage and chill
Or get grilled
Like a omelette trying to climb in my field
You need to enhance your IQ
To do what I do
Purchase a passport and fly where I flew
Have some self-respect
Get some self-esteem
Imagine
Dream what nobody else could dream
Impostors
Won't get a slot on my roster
Reminder: You're not him and you're not her
But that portrayal might just get you an Oscar
Tell me: are you a minister or are you a mobster?
One minute you Muslim and the next you a Rasta
One second you're Weezy and the next you're Big Poppa
Nah, don't even think of dropping a tape
These cats don't cultivate, they just copy and paste
It's like that

[Hook]
