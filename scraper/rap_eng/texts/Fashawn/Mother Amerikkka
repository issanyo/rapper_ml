[Intro]
You’re dealing with a criminal government here
These are criminals in power
And it didn’t start with Bush
Thinkin’ that you making progress
Where the hell is the progress for the masses of your people who are going backwards?

[Verse 1]
Temptation of enemy, how does man avoid it?
Took away his profits handed him the poison
Gave him ten commandments and a pamphlet to follow
This world’s like a xanny: too massive to swallow
Regurgitated what I consumed
At times I wish I could’ve stayed in the womb
Somebody, anybody, what’s the worth of a black life?
Or even a brown one? I heard they get found son
When his noodle’s hanging outside of his dome
Mama gotta pay for the funeral, need a loan
She’ll be lucky if his murder even make the news
I feel a pain like Billy when she sang the blues
‘Bout the strangest fruit, have to have a bite
Blame America for my appetite
I even heard the new KKK is Kim, Kylie, and Kanye
Mother Amerikkka

[Hook]
Tell me how could you take my smile away from me
You said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie
Tell me how could you take my smile away from me
You said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie

[Verse 2]
Yo Lady Liberty got a pentagram in her vagina
Ever seen a tommy gun in the hands of a minor?
Ever seen a cop grab his cannon and fire
At somebody unarmed? A brother bodily harmed
Feel like I don’t belong, I want eye on the law
Thinkin’ if they kill us one by one—problem resolved
I might get Willie Lynch’d for this rhyme
A pinch with some time, my face on a picket sign
A nation on fire while money’s the messiah
Even treat they own presidents like pariahs
Wish it was simply black and white, no Mariah
In the USA the hue is Freddie Gray
Confusion infused with the ignorance
I wonder if I’m a citizen or an immigrant
They have the nerve to call my family illegal
We all spinnin’ on the axis of evil
Mother Amerikkka

[Hook]
Tell me how could you take my smile away from me
You said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie
Tell me how could you take my smile away from me
You said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie

[Verse 3]
No justice for Alton Sterling or Bettie Jones
Miguel Espinal, Nathaniel Picket, Philando
That’s the taste of a Bland decision
Abulances, families panic-stricken
Lie in a casket or you could land in prison
That ultimatum still stands in the land we live in
All it took was a few grams, got my man convicted
It’s harder being Dante than being Darren Wilson
So N-O-T-O-R-I-O-U-S in the U.S
She down, blow
In debt, confess we owe each other a lot
Still I hug her like she the only mother I got
Even though she threw shade on the sunniest spots
Turned every one of her sons into something they not
I been insane since I came out her stomach
I don’t know how else to say I’m in love with Mother Amerikkka

[Hook]
Tell me how could you take my smile away from me
You said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie
Tell me how could you take my smile away from me
You said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie
