[Verse 1: Fashawn]
He walks around with a mug on his face
Gun on his waist
No sense of direction
No one to relate
Attitude stubborn he's just stuck in his ways
Hustling haze how the funds came, out trappin'
Never listened to the preacher
The corner where you could reach him
Inviting any beef keeps his palms on his nina
Cursing the teacher, sat in front of me
Always peeped him
My freshman year he was the only senior
In the class, cuz he never passed, came and went
Didn't graduate hit the streets
Gangbanging with some angry kids
That's famous from maiming niggas
Mamma used to tell me stay away from them
Too intense when he talks and never makes sense
Fake pimp, 19, and his future's looking kinda dim
Should have used common sense
Relax your mind, inside you will find a gem

[Hook] x 4
Gotta relax yourself, just relax yourself
Relax yourself and just chill

[Verse 2: Thurzday]

Shots of Henny, Gray Goose or Remmy
Whatever alcoholic substance he can abuse
Life dwindling down like a dynamite fuse
Driving down the road might just explode
Out in a drunked rage
With a bottle for passenger
Strapped just to ease the pain
His wife just shook on him and she took his son
Left no numbers, left in a slumber
Found out who Tanisha was
And who Tanisha was four months pregnant
Illegitimate son
He accelerates on the gas and runs a red light
Hits the driver side of a Pontiac all white
Head hits the windshield vision ain't right
Who he hit in the Pontiac was his dead wife
Took his son's life
Now if the story was real
I guess the moral is...

[Hook] x 4

[Verse 3: Fashawn]

Some brothers compare they queens to cars
Need more than one
Misuse them then upgrade after they done
He never thought of settling down, too much fun
Going out hitting up clubs, on the hunt
For young girls with no brains and self esteem
He takes them home loosens they blouse sells them a dream
They cave in fall victims to his scheme
Oblivious to the fact he got HIV
And he's ignorant to the fact they've got fake ID's
Said she's 25 but she's 18
Before you know it he infecting they bloodstream
Never used protection, claimed he was clean
Different women every night, blacks latinos and whites
Knows wrong from right but continues to live his life
On the edge, no one to guide him
Walking genocide someone should have advised him..

[Hook] x 4
