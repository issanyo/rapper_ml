[Verse 1: Fashawn]

My thoughts travel by the speed of light
So bright
Can teach the blind how to read and write
I'm on a path divine
Craft the rhyme like a graff design, make the masses mine
Empty a magazine like a glass of wine
Just a matter of time
Before the doctors at the 'spital have to stitch them up
Be a victim of the little nigga with the biggest nuts
The understanding of power
You get fifteen minutes to be the man of the hour
So I plan to stack a ton of loot
And that's the doubletruth, my jacket bubblegoose
In the winter just to hide the heater
Spit out an acapella like it's Aquafina
Got the spirit of a leader and lyrics by the liter
Dripping out the speaker, nigga

[Bridge: Fashawn]
Thirsty as the day I took my first breath
Back like I never left
From the start to the ending
I pick up from where you finish
At last I welcome you to the beginning

[Hook: Fashawn]
(Where should I begin)
The beginning
(Flow H20)
The beginning
(Flow H20) (Where should i begin)
The beginning
(Flow H20)
The beginning
At last this the beginning
The beginning, the beginning, the beginning, the beginning

[Verse 2: Fashawn]

I'm only human but
Admit I got animal tendencies
Malevolent, probably turn your man to a memory
I dare one of you amateurs mention me
Remote control how I channel my energy
Shooting dice over persian rugs
I'm the reason they raised the price up on certain drugs
My only outlet
Was to find the plug that I respected
Connect to supply the thugs
Where should I begin
Well lets start at the end
I made alot of money but never made amends
Friends turned foes
Foes turned friends
My whole world turned to one wicked whirlwind
But, lets go back to the beginning
Before i lost my innocence, started jacking with my henchman
I was trying to cath the rhythm
Just trying to find a pocket
For all of these paragraphs just pouring out my noggin

[Bridge: Fashawn]
Thirsty as the day I took my first breath
Back like I never left
From the start to the ending
I pick up from where you finish
At last I welcome you to the beginning

[Hook: Fashawn]
(Where should I begin)
The beginning
(Flow H20)
The beginning
(Flow H20) (Where should i begin)
The beginning
(Flow H20)
The beginning
At last this the beginning
The beginning, the beginning, the beginning, the beginning
