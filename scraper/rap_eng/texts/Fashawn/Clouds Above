(The clouds above)
(The clouds above)
(The clouds above opened up and let it out)

I spread my wings in the city of angels
Look at my life from a whole other angle
A bird's eye view out the sky no parachute
The redefinition of fly, I (let it out)
Like sunshine when the clouds open
Feeling free off of that loud floatin’
A thousand feet in the sky, undeniably high
High enough to look the Lord in his eyes
I took a second to lie

(The clouds above)

Trying to make do with what I was given
Think I’m losin’ my religion
And there you go a again
I’m not holding nothin’ back I’m just holding something in
It’s time to (let it out)
You know, get it off of my chest
I got a list of regrets I wish that God would forget
I’mma need a salvation in this foul nation
In anticipation of reuniting with all my niggas waitin’

In the (clouds above)
All my people waiting
In the (clouds above)
All my people all my people
(The clouds above opened up and let it out)

(The clouds above)
(The clouds above)
(The clouds above opened up, let it out)

Saw the pain in your eyes
And I wish I was to blame this time
But the only thing we can blame is time
You knew it wasn’t your fault
That a loved one was lost
I mean….I wish I could turn your pain into mine
F.Y.I on me you can relay for a helping hand
Or a shoulder where you can cry
No need to feel embarrassed
Left so many memories for us to cherish
Don’t be afraid to let it (out)
You ever felt like taking a leap of faith
Just to see if you land on your feet or your face
Just imagine you can fly
Keep that feelin’ bottled inside and just (let it out)
