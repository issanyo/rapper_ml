[Verse 1]
Look like your pen done ran outta ink, ‘cause your grammar was weak
I bring famine in your family tree, damage the beat like Jeru
When I’m drunk off brew
Only West Coast nigga coulda been in the Wu
Miscellaneous raps when I’m just stating the facts
Making sure the sunshine still stay on the map
I call it progress, they say I’m taking it back
I say I rhyme like I’m aiming a Mac
Laying ‘em on they face ‘til they cranium crack, I’m ice cold
I write scrolls that ignite the globe
So ahead of time I could enlight the old
Energize the youth when I’m inside the booth
Never gave ‘em nothin’ aside from the truth
I play it cool, every few bars I drop a jewel
One thing I wasn’t good at: following rules
I don’t shine it if I’m not in the mood
When situations occur, gotta cook up a verse
At the blink of an eye, they tellin’ me to go first
I set it off…I set it off…come on, come on, come on…

Hit ‘em with a … little bit of … little bit of … little bit of
Hit ‘em with a … little bit of …
Yeah, check it out, uh, uh…

[Verse 2]
Okay, I’m back in effect, with a gat and a vest
Bad chick on my lap, headed back to the West
Pour out a little liquor for my niggas that left
In memory of your life, I gotta do it to death
I make it simple and plain, you can call me ‘The F’
Back in the day, I would slaughter cassettes
Now we up at Chung King’s, no four-finger rings
Or gold ropes, I’m outlawed, E.D.I. Mean
Every syllable is adrenaline pumped in your ear
You couldn’t duplicate the style or come near
Unmatched high, evolve in one year
Blew past almost all of my peers
Now look at all the hoodrats, they all stare
I’m just doing what I’m good at, it’s quite clear
That I’m your nightmare—they like, “Yeah”
I’m like, “Whoever want it, I’m right here, nigga, come on”

Hit ‘em with a … little bit of … little bit of … little bit of
Hit ‘em with a … little bit of … come on, come on, come on
Hit ‘em with a … little bit of … little bit of …
Hit ‘em with a … little bit of …
