[Intro: Fashawn]
Shit is madness...the fuck is wrong with you?
Yo Al, calm down, calm down man...
No really, what the fuck is wrong with with you?
You got some nerve, bitch
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Tell me, how could you disrespect me in public?
You can come and get the rest of your luggage
This has nothing to do with fame, shit I came from nothing
And I know when a bitch brains corrupted
Still in awe; not Eve, wondering "Why Eve?"
The one who gave birth, supposed to be the Earth to my seed
If I could press rewind, I never would've put my hands on you
Never read the manual, "Things that a Man Should Do"
Uh, I'll admit I've had a few
April, Danielle, Rachel, Amber too
The furthest thing from the family dude
Showed us pictures of me somewhere on camera nude (that's fucked up, I'm sorry)
Shit, I tried but honestly
The concept of monogamy is not for me
Only thing I'm  afraid of is commitment
I'm sorry but this relationship has ended, now stay up out my business (bitch)

[Bridge]
So if you want to see a nigga again, you ain't gotta pretend
Uh, no I'm not a lover, but I'm more than a friend, I don't know where to begin
And she don't ever want to go out, she said she'd rather go in

[Interlude: Fashawn and Samples]
Let's go in, hey hey, oh
"There's some ladies out there that can do some wild shit"
I'm telling you, dawg. Know what I'm saying though?
Yeah, I see them too
"Check this out"
Ok, ok, type of bitch, I know you ain't lying

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Uh, her crib's spacious but its rented
She get impatient when it come to big faces
Summertime: paper-chase, hibernate for the winter
Just maybe you'll catch her face in December
Kept her fans itching, I mean the fiends springing
Had that ambition, trying to reach a zenith
To the top from the bottom, all the while
Stayed fresh from her socks to her noggin off the Game Wess
Like Jigga out West, they're in trenches
Type of chickens that drive Lexuses and Benzes
But still alift in Maybach, keep her thang cocked
A pain in the ass; bucket, ain't no straight shots
I swear I'd never hit a woman
But I'd shake the shit out, when if she don't zip her mouth up
Can't live with them, can't live without them
We go overboard for what's under their blouses
I swear, some be on some wild shit
You know the ones you wouldn't want to have a child with
Oh no, I see your ass and trowel tip
I can tell by a smile she a foul bitch

[Interlude: Fashawn and Samples]
Check it out, uh, check it out
"Something for your mind, body, and your soul"
Uh-huh, yeah; ayo Alc
We coming from, coming from, uh uh

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
From the side of California where dreams are denied
And niggas collect cream doing crime
But for me, fortunately, I can rhyme
Believed eventually I would shine
Climb out the bucket in fact, never stuck in the trap
I'm singing, the production is what I come to attack
Quit bumping your gums and go uncrumble your raps
You ain't a boss, you a worker; here, hustle this pack
Boy, get down or get from 'round here
For a pound, I'll leave a clown aired the fuck out
In a minute, knock a nigga from his couch to his kitchen
Uh, I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be
All I got is my word, these two balls in my jeans
And the world in my palm as long as I'm in control
I hypnotize your mind, body, and soul
Let it be known

[Outro: Fashawn and Sample]
It's the F, nigga
Uh, word to safety, word is simply
"All my life I've been a rolling stone
I got no place that I call my home"
Desperado, Santiago, uh
