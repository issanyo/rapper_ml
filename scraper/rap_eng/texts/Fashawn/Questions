[Krondon]

Caolition of the willing
No relation to the self-serving hermits in the higher positions
Correlation of a killing, in fact
The true and living, I exalt
Eradicates fault and ????
Product of prohibition
Young son of Ronald Reagan's '84 crack era
Feel terror
In the mirror find reflections of the struggle
How the streets infect him
Impressions from an automatic weapon
Can't teach em death
Fear the electric chair's a short walk
But a long way down, not to ballpark
A paradise
Like a Peruvian flight
???? the horror of a hooligans life
Parallel to the lessons I learned twice
Tell me how lucky can one man be
That's three
Will he make it out the game 'fore his legs break
Wandering, running for nothing but a  way to get cake


[Hook: Fashawn]

2X
All the long nights
Short Days
Blood, sweat and tears
Sit back and look at my life like
How'd I make it here?
This can't be real
It's all a dream
This can't be right

[Planet Asia]

Aphrodite calligraphy
Nigga tree
Mac ministry
Straight out the middle east
Malevolent militia
We forcing agendas on infidels
The records catch burn like single cell?
Your daughters love me
I get a lot of bush
100 bars, three packs of woods, a lot of kush
I'm on your neck with a solid foot
You got the brolic look but you not a crook
Fuck out the way 'fore I do something to you
In the kitchen with coke, I might have put the heat to your cup of noodles
I style pricey, foul and shiesty. Rhyme Icy
What I spit is just a fix for the pipe fiends
Vivid with my thoughts like sight-seeing
Kilos of ice cream got the house flooded with nice things
Nature taking it's course, violent assault, my timing is warped
Diamonds over Nautica sport

[Fashawn]

Skipped college went straight for the pros
For those who don't know, lets end the speculation
Scribbled rhymes out back of my hand, second nature
Started following the omens, realized my life's sacred
All the time niggas ask "where you been?"
'Fore you know it I'm gone in the wind, doing my thing
In another region squeezing my pen, burning the flame
Them aromatic backwoods clouded my brain
Back in my lane
Doing what I'm 'posed to do
T-shirts, sweatshirts trying to make mogul moves
Like Percy and Russel, I flex my mind and my muscle
In the meantime still intertwining with hustlers
If it's 4 broke niggas I ain't trying to be the 5th
On the turf since birth
I was cursed with a gift
I can turn a flower to a pistol, man that's power
100 miles per hour with a pencil
