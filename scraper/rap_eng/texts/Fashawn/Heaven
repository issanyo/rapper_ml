[Hook]
Even though that you gone, I know I’ll see you again, yeah
Just put in a good word for me and my niggas, and hopefully we get in
Ah, and I’ll see you in heaven
I’ll see you in heaven, yeah
I’ll see you in heaven
I’ll see you in heaven, Ahh

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Now I ain’t here to say goodbye and I regret it to this day
My excuse, life just got in the way, should have been by your side
How come I couldn't stay, nah I got a place
A bouquet of flowers where you lay
Instead of mourning your death, your life we celebrate
The memories you left, a sudden twist of fate
I know you up in heaven, hope they let me through the gates
But put in a good word just in case
I know I made a promise and I intend to keep it
A kiss is what the sweetest, I always spent the weekend
With Aaron out, Peach and King hanging by the bleachers
A sunny side, that’s how I spent most of my summer times
When we was the younger guys
Can’t deny it’s try not to come and hide
We off puffing live but
Somehow you kept us in line
This is mine 'till next time, never goodbye shorty

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I often wonder will it get better than this
Or maybe worse, I just hope that the heaven exist
I always pictured curly faces, standing on top of clouds
Someone standing at the entrance to tell us if we allowed
A list paring all the mistakes I ever made
Even say I lost a hole of my faith in 7th grade, or the 8th
Always did it my way, never afraid
Always, 7 steps away from being saved
To show my face in funny, your majesty I’m ashamed
Still for the family get from praise
Holler and hallelujah in the manner he was raised
To pouring champagne on the ceiling
On behalf of the pain I feel, I’m still grieving
Why did you had to die, know you’re somewhere in the sky
So this is mine till next time, never goodbye shorty

[Hook]
