[Intro]
Yeah, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Livin' with the brother of his mother in the gutter of Cleveland
Subject schemin', hustle and thievin'
Carjackin' with a bundle of knucklehead heathens
They sell it for a couple hundred bucks the next evenin'
Cisco is his name, only child
Product of a broken home, he would (?) the wild
Hardly ever hugged his mother, her aroma was foul
For the dope, give you dome was the style, uh
She laid a overdose and left Cisco on his own
Weight of the world, he holds it alone
All he got is his deck and his dogs
And El Camino, some Corvettes for her son
Supplyin' the whips, some how got to get rich
In the streets of Ohio, he took an obvious risk
I watch them sell molly in an alley of six
He felt like he get swallowed in a bottomless pit

[Hook]
All day long, get that dough
Flip that pack, go back get more
It comes fast or it comes slow
When the strip hot, he get low
He flaunt it though, get that dough
Flip that pack, go back get more
It comes fast or it comes slow
When the strip hot, hot, hot

[Verse 2]
He was sister and brotherless
Fatherless, motherless
Built the camaraderie with the posse he's runnin' with
Familia was somethin' he lacked
Hugged the block for so long it started hugging him back
Innocence gone, I see it in his eyes when we meet
I can identify he reminds me of me
Met him all
Since 1999 was the street
Round the time E 1999 was released
Cisco graduated, got a crime PhD
Blinded, can't see his own demise at his feet
His reality's far cry from his dreams
Of bein' pro skater, gettin' signed to a team
He's becomin' someone you won't miss
Got a price on his head in the 216
What it's bout, who got that and who got this?
Young homie gon' move that brick
Long live the dealer

[Hook]
All day long, get that dough
Flip that pack, go back get more
It comes fast or it comes slow
When the strip hot, he get low
He flaunt it though, get that dough
Flip that pack, go back get more
It comes fast or it comes slow
When the strip hot, hot, hot

[Outro]
Yo, walk with me over here, walk with me over here. Have you ever met somebody that remind you of somebody that reminds you of-of yourself? What up to my man Cisco. Where ever he is, I hope he's still grindin', my nigga. That's how it is in the streets, it happens every day -- I know a Cisco, you know a Cisco. Cisco's theme song, dedicated to all the hustlers. Long live dealer, long live the dealer, long live the dealer, long live the dealer
