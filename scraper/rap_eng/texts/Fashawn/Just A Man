[Hook: Fashawn]
Do what I gotta do to eat
Taking nothing from no one and standing on my own feet
I tried, but I can’t swallow my pride
(I’m just a man)
Homie, my only enemy is time
I’m living like I’m ready to die
Thinking about grabbing this 9 cause I’m just a man!

[Verse One: Fashawn]
Oh, I’ll be eating lunch with whites like Condoleezza Rice
Got em saying Mr Laver you’re right, say what you like
Gotta love me even though I was born ugly
Cursed by the sins of Adam got me living like a savage
At the same time lavish, grew up to be an addict for fashion
Good hash, sheesh and fat asses
The ones with class though
Fuck them cause Fash knows
STO is because of the cash flow
Can’t keep a visa, but I keep me some hash rolled
Never gave a fuck, been the same since the tadpole
Such an asshole! Really, is that so?
Swawty I move fast, and don’t try to act slow
Ask if you ain’t knowing I'm the princw of the city
Know every broad, every nigga wanna be in my video
Come on, man!
Guess I’m just a mother fucking man!
Feel like I’m fighting with time, you couldn’t understand
That’s the difference!

[Verse Two: Fashawn]
Please forgive me but I bleed just like you
Stack cheese, smoke weed just like you count cheese
Why you niggas count Zs I’m psycho!
Now that I think about it I’m like no body
Love Shawties live fast and drive slow
Chain on throats looking like his eyes closed
Hardly ever smiles and he stay on his iPhone in grind mode
Wondering where did the time go
Passports stamped up, feeling like a champ, what?
Fuck you niggas say, they ain’t left the USA
Woods when I’m in LA, woods when I’m in the bay
OC beats when I’m over seas
They love me cause they know I’m the truth
In any live show, I probably tore off the roof
Just wanna make it to Heaven while I stay in the sky
Wanna play, be the same till the day that I die
Walking around with dead white men in my pocket
Lincolns, Jacksons, Franklins, Washingtons
I’m balling!
