[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Fuck rappers, ban 'em like flavored Dutch Masters
Your cuts after I listen to 'em with much laughter
Champagne slush my campaign Krush
Grooving, powder Peruvian, black Nubian manoeuver
I'm like Max Julien to Cougars, with more racks than Hooters
Wasn't for rap I'd probably be head of the pack
Pass the straps to shooters
Pockets lacking Gouda, that's when niggas pack the Ruger
I caught a cool run, my crew runs shit, Hilltop Hustling logic
Rock your pillbox, I still got a couple of projects
Niggas can't fuck with my accomplishments
The Don is supreme sonic, Ebonic, speaking in phonics
Reminiscing on hand to hand, running from big knots
Now it's G&Gs all over my silk top
Amongst trappers, in the cuts we clutch clappers
Ain't another nigga die for nigga, fuck rappers
[Verse 2: Willie The Kid]
Fuck rappers, niggas 'posed to been dead
Bled through the Band-Aid, I'm Pinhead
Hell raising, I lay blades Clive Barker and Wes Craven
My neck's craving, I savor the flavor
It's savoir faire save my fear for the saviour
For all the rest of y'all I got a bomb, Jaeger
Especially you rappers, fuck all of y'all
Fast forward then backwards, sick chiropractor
I'm hot like the sand out in Cairo, a pyro
Maniac, a klepto, braniac I'm zany
Pop it like a Xanie, declare war, Cheney
My ho is like Claire Huxtable, hard lustable
All these rap niggas gassed up, combustible
Feminine internet niggas, fucking weirdos
Me and Planet Asia like Albert Anastasia
But we Asiatic, original fabric
Never fabricated, ain't got it, never had it
Used to play ball now you want to be a rapper

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
You know what, fuck rappers
We puff puff past 'em, turn niggas to blunt ashes
Consider me retro and vintage
I'm blowing dro out in Venice
A role model and my role is simple
That's captivate your soul and control your mental
Teach you how to hold a pistol
Go to Nobu and order the whole menu
Glow like I wrote it with a solid gold pencil
G shit, cause thorough is how I keep it
Niggas know, every block every borough, it ain't a secret
Flow rare like the first hair on a Mona Lisa
Check your intellect cause you're in front of a teacher
I roll the kind of reefer that'll give you amnesia
Don't believe it well roll up a gram and have a damn seizure
