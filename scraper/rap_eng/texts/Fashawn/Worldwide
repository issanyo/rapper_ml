[Intro: TL Cross]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse One: Fashawn]
Now she complain all the time
How I'm away on the grind
Doing days, every state, all the places I fly
Out the rise, nationwide with my niggas who down to ride
If I ain't, multiply my numbers then never mind!
L.A.X. every weekend don't be surprised
All she do is give me seat-back love, help me recline
Ah, this is the life! I hope it last
Just a high school drop out, sitting in first class
On my way to Osaka, champagne and some pasta
Damn shame, a youngn' make his way out the projects
This baby I remember nights before the flashy lights
Only flights I ever saw was a pair of Air Nikes Shawty!

[Hook: TL Cross]
Oh, all I really wanna know
All I really wanna do
Is spend a little time with you
As long as you know!
Baby, that I'm worldwide, I'm worldwide
I know you know, yeah, yeah
Baby, that I'm worldwide, I'm worldwide
I know you know, yeah, yeah

[Verse Two: Fashawn]
JFK every weekend you wonder why
All she do is ask a nigga to stay and I decline
I realize I'm worldwide with my niggas who're down to fly
If it ain't about that money, Shawty pay it no mind
People say that I live such an expensive life
All I need is a passport and a Samsonite
A G4, I'll probably land in Japan tonight
WiFi on the flight, hit the fam on Skype
And touch down in the city, every town on my grizzly
I get around lifting nowhere to be found
Did you miss me baby? I've been on my hustle
Paper is what I'm chasing
And for your information, I've never been on vacation
I'm just saying though!

[Hook: TL Cross]
Oh, all I really wanna know
All I really wanna do
Is spend a little time with you
As long as you know!
Baby, that I'm worldwide, I'm worldwide
I know you know, yeah, yeah
Baby, that I'm worldwide, I'm worldwide
I know you know, yeah, yeah

[Verse Three: Fashawn]
What if I would have stayed in my hood?
Probably be up to no good
Saying goodbye to the ghetto and hello Hollywood
Still puffing in public, I wouldn't change if I could
Usually out there for paper, remember those back woods
I got a custom in customs, drinking vodka in Russia
I go shopping in Harlem and make you stop at the rucker
Tequila in Tijuana got a queen in Rwanda
Another one out in Ghana, pieced out my piece out in Compton
Eazy E in OE, the only thing we got in common
The chick in Chi city that we blow
We call them Windy oh, oh
He's back at it, the iron lung never asthmatic
And you're acting as you've never seen the atlas, Shawty

[Hook: TL Cross]
Oh, all I really wanna know
(And I know that you know
That is international F and I'm back in effect)
All I really wanna do
Is spend a little time with you
As long as you know!
Baby, that I'm worldwide, I'm worldwide
(You should know)
I know you know, yeah, yeah
Baby, that I'm worldwide, I'm worldwide
I know you know, yeah, yeah
