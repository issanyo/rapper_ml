Woke up pissed off, dick hard
Just thinking
What the fuck Im'ma do with these Abe Lincolns
Stacking these Ben Franks, big bank
Still your average shit stanks
Feeling like a shark in the fish tank
Swimming with piranhas
Swisher full of ganja
Twisting up my conscience, distant from the nonsense
Giving it to 'em constantly, the kid is a monster
I'll kill any concept and rip any concert
The flow H20, like water
Born 88, but 99 when's life started for a young disciple
I stopped reading the bible
And started reading niggas body language
I was inspired by the guys I hanged with
Type dangerous, saturated by mob shit
The mind-frame I'm in
Spending time writing rhymes trying to shake the pen
One time trying to take me in
We counting dough
Doing shows out in Berlin
Germany they never heard of me places I've never been
Where should I begin, where your career ends
Nigga

This shit sounds beautiful man keep this shit rollin' for me my nigga

I think I've got this earth mastered
From the turf a bastard
Now I swerve through pastures of green
Brush shoulders with actors I mean
Considered that little nigga with big dreams
It was 09 when I started making cream
Ballin like my homies that should have went to the league
Planted they first seed, converted to slanging weed
Try not to get devoured by money power and greed
They say I'm shining I know
They blinded I'm focused
Grinding, my eye on the final hour
Posted, renegade with a pen and page
I rip the stage
Gritting and grinding through with grits and grain
I set the strip ablaze
They ask what I think of fame
I say skip it and keep your shit the same
Music business insane like morning love
Say, it's a shame what rapper's will do for a name
Saluting a chain I think they're brusing a Buddha
Polluted my brain, cuz no 1 and 2 is the name
It's the shit that I formulate
Psycho as Norman Bates
Even color-coordinated the nigga you outta hate
Really doubting where my mind at ya'll relate
Narrate, author of that raw shit call me Kane
Arm and hammer grammar it could put me in the slammer
Rather be in Atlanta rolling swishers in a hammock
Home chilling with Hannah, lampin in my pajamas
Sribbling in my Tablet, me and my baby mamma
Done touring laving, same old madness
Network traffick, stacking, overdrafting
Number one draft pick with a Mac 10
Balling like Pac 10 cuz the club packed out
Rap nerds that listen to craft work count cheese like ?
Nigga I'm absurd, remind you of the Golden Era
Use to tote Lorettas, push dough there was no one better
No hope got me rolling letters
Out of dro I be smoking resin
Case closed, kept me floating below the heavens
44's, blow hoes, so my motherfuckin' foes get the message
Somebody phone the paramedics
I'm in the zone
Feel at home even when I'm on the others side of the globe
Riding alone, jotting what's inside of my dome
