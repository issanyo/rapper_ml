It's madness...
It's tragic...

[Verse 1]
Went from a Jansport to a Louis bag
The young backpacker turned Samsonite Man
I sit in laugh out in Switzerland getting grams
Non-negotiable here's a list of my demands, couple quoteables
I can't even feel my hands, that's what the dro will do
Still can't wait to hit Japan, maybe Tokoyo, or Osaka
Another plane, and to say that I'm different would only make me the same
So I'm the same
As you, as one, let's remain
Try to rearrange the human brain
And the heart that's a start let's provoke change
Fuck a gold chain, you stuck in the old days
Sounds funny don't it
I'm so young and determined
Was young and hopeless
Cowboy, gun in my holster
Now I got my aim and I'm focused
One foot in the game, the other on Shields Ave
It's tragic, living in a habitat of madness
Patty cake, patty cake, niggas bake and bag bricks
Keep a shooter like the Mavericks
Gotta keep a ruger when maneuvering through traffic
I don't do nothing but rhyme
Give me a second bet you I can change the color of time
Just hit rewind, guarantee you it will free your fucking mind
Hope you lost...

[Hook] x2
All the places I go
Swear I've been here before
They ain't seen what I've seen
They don't know what I know

[Verse 2]
Free your mind
Hope you got yours cause I think I lost mine a long time ago
Black clouds follow wherever Santiago roll
A desperado, out on my own
Light another spliff, jot another poem
You'll say I was right when I died
Just know I did it every day of my life
You know why cause I get paid just to say what I like
And get high, only dilemma is me making this flight
It's my life

You don't get to travel the world
Talk my shit
This shit is crazy
There's nothing like it man

[Hook] x2
