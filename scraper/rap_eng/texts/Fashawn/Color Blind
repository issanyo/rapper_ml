[Background Sample] Blue is the color of the red sky X 4

[Verse One: Fashawn] Uh, I’ve seen the crip lying dead with blood on his chest
Next to an AK slug to the vest there was no rest before it’s all set
Like a young playing poker with a old deck
Same tricks, same cards
Life for a life, your game of ours
The game is flawed, we can’t afford to have more casualties in an aimless war
Now you tell me really what you banging for
I ain’t trying to preach and tell you praise the Lord
You try to save my own, but it all starts at a place called home
The ghetto sounds like the shooting range
We’re the proof, won't remove the pain
Let’s do the training, let’s choose the claim
Red and blue with every hood you bang
We all the fuck the same
Five shootings, twelve hours don't need yours just shell showers
It's in hell of ours keep a black suit
A bouchet of flowers better safe than sour
No seat belt, but they strapped it up
Pack it on if you face the cowards
Stole the graveyards the only finish line in the race for power!

Blue is the color of the red sky
Blue is the color of the red sky
Blue is the color of the red sky
Blue is the color of the red sky

[Verse Two: Fashawn]
We live a life that’s do or die
Even the blood feel blue inside
We’re victims of our own desire
Living in a city where the skinny niggas ride,uh
The only remining is that it’s getting high
Pouring Hennessy for those that are still alive
Some say nevermind be unified
So we separate you like you and I, oh
They’re be sending kids to their maker, uh
In my neck of the woods
Got no love for my neighbor, much love of my hood
I will program the whole can is that 44 make your dude vanish
Now it's yellow tape, ambulances
Bullet holes and no news cameras
The question is when will it stop?
Defend your own, can’t depend on the cops
Let the Lord strike me if that ain’t true, true
Fact remains that they are gang too
We're forever at war , please , somebody tell us what for?
If there's the shells on the floor
Nobody uses their heads anymore
So I'm asking

Blue is the color of the red sky
Blue is the color of the red sky
We gotta stop killing each other man
Blue is the color of the red sky
It’s no purpose
Blue is the color of the red sky
Kill your brother, kill your enemy
It's the same thing
Blue is the color of the red sky
Walk as a king, my nigga
Think like a king!
It’s real, we’re all kings!
It’s gotta think like that, think what I’m saying
