[Intro: Fashawn]
I wrote this in Rotterdam, eating a Toblerone
Staring out a window, me and my mobile phone
Puffing on some endo, feeling so far from home
And don't know why I'm complaining, finally on my own
About fifty - sixty days, how long have I been gone?
But who's counting, I just know it's been a little too long
And yet I'm travelling backpackin'
Far from packin'
Like an addict fucks to matter, this is madness
No matter cause I

[Hook: Fashawn]
Won't be happy 'til I get home
Won't be happy until til I get home
Won't be happy until til I get ho-oo-oo-oo-oome

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
In the midst of moving too fast, I learn to take my time
This world can be hectic, you could get left behind
So we stress and let it eat us up from inside
You gotta get it off your chest and keep it off your mind
Sometimes, I wonder will I see twenty-five?
What will I be in three years? Hopefully in my prime
Pray nothing happen like some static
I be strapped in case it happens
With a magnum for you maggots can't kick that

[Hook: Fashawn]

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Sometimes I feel like I'm writing my life away
In the studio night and day, lighting haze
Spit it like I'm twice my age
And all I need is a mic and a stage
Some would say I ain't sane
Sick of these airplanes, automobiles and these trains, shit
Maybe I'm right, then again, maybe I'm wrong
Another day 'nother song, fuck I'm taking too long
I guess what happens some more madness
Automatic like I got it like an addict
I have it like some static as soon as I get home, yeah

Won't be happy until til I get home, yeah
Won't be happy until til I get home
Won't be happy until til I get ho-oo-oo-oo-oome, oh
Won't be happy until til I get home, yeah
Won't be happy until til I get ho-oo-oo-oo-oome, oh
