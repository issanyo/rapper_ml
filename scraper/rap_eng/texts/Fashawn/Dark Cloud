[Intro]
Drop, drop
Is for my niggas in the pen
Drop, drop
For all my brothers in the box
Drop, drop
Hold your head, hold your head
Is my letter to you

[Hook]
I said I need a new nigga
For these dark clouds follow
Cause while it's over me is too black to see tomorrow
Said I need a new nigga for these dark clouds to follow
Cause while it's over me is too black to see tomorrow
Said I need a new nigga for these dark clouds to follow
Cause while it's over me is too dark to see tomorrow
Take another sip from the bottle, bottle, bottle

[Verse One]
From out the corner of my eye seen the fiend stagger
Up to a hustler in this teens with his jeans sagging
Hat tilted to the left with a mean swagger
Don't plan on leaving the scene till this cream add up
Could have got a scholarship, but he fell victim
Dropped out twelve grade caught a jail sentence
Had a polluted mind state, couldn't dwell in it
A look of death in his eyes, face was pale skinned
Looking not like a man, but a frail image
Not the normal hustler cause he was kind of timid
About as skinny as a gram he would try and pitch it
Got a taste of that nose candy caught a fly addiction
Ask me if I need it to fix, but I resisted
The block hot keep it moving, is what I insisted
It will take another bid before he realize he's slipping
Into the cycle we're all living
It's called hell prison, prison!

[Hook]
I said I need a new nigga
For these dark clouds follow
Cause while it's over me is too black to see tomorrow
Said I need a new nigga for these dark clouds to follow
Cause while it's over me is too black to see tomorrow
Said I need a new nigga for these dark clouds to follow
Cause while it's over me is too dark to see tomorrow
Take another sip from the bottle, bottle, bottle

[Verse Two]
I assume that he envisions a better life for himself
The type that he don't have to pedal white for the wealth
Is in the demons let's keep it up in night, nothing helps
He tried lean and codeine in the sprite on the shelf
But he becomes hollow as the bottle that he drunk
Lives life on the edge, but I doubt he'd ever jump, huh
Trying to find Heaven in hell in every second
Heading into a dead end couldn't tell you where his head is
Still accounting this paper, preacher counting his blessings
Evil in all directions, heathens was Smith n Wessons
His son's teething desperately in need of affection
Instead CPS steps in I see him stressing
He threw away his future couldn't escape his past
Caught up chasing cash, an inmate at last
He's physically free, but confined
His hell is imaginary, the prison is in his mind

[Hook x2]
I said I need a new nigga
For these dark clouds follow
Cause while it's over me is too black to see tomorrow
Said I need a new nigga for these dark clouds to follow
Cause while it's over me is too black to see tomorrow
Said I need a new nigga for these dark clouds to follow
Cause while it's over me is too dark to see tomorrow
Take another sip from the bottle, bottle, bottle
