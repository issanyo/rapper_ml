[Verse 1-Fashawn]
When I was young, I figured if I became a star
Maybe they wouldn't seem as far
Maybe I wouldn't dream as hard
Wanna stop, but all I hear is that applause
I'm addicted to the energy it causes
I wanna relive it every minute, that star
Know I'mma shine despite all of my hardships
I consider them lessons instead of losses
My old Nikes wouldn't fit, so I tossed 'em
They wasn't fit for the fire I had to walk through
A lot of disappointments, a lot of promises
A lot of niggas fell off, they lack confidence
They had a dream but didn't know how to conquer it
It's not your accomplishments, it's what's inside of us
A star is a star and it shines regardless
Of the money and the fame, it's what's in your heart
So many stars

[Hook-Aloe Blacc]
So many stars, so many stars
Which one to choose, which way to go
Each one's a song for me
So many stars to see
So many stars, so many stars
Which one to choose, which way to go
Each one's a song for me
So many stars to see

[Verse 2-Fashawn]
Even if I reach the clouds, I'll by flyer than 'em all
See, the thing about stars, they shine, some even fall
So, you're forced to watch 'em, listen to 'em in your car
Even at home on your screen, you can seem them from afar
I be nervous at times, admit I get butterflies
When the crowd yells "Ho!" it's a natural high
Still after every show, I'm tryin' to see at least a grand
Meltin' mic stands from LA to Japan
Me and Ex on a mission, so respect intuition
Blessed with a vision, obsessed with writin' lyrics
I guess, it was written in the sky like a scripture
Back in time, history, never said it was mine
Now we rackin' up arenas, emceein', kickin' rhymes
Labels wanna give me some G's, that's just fine
A star is a star and it shines regardless
Of the money and the fame, it's what's in your heart
So many stars
