[Intro]
Make them believe
This my song to talk
I don’t know no other way
Every word that you could say
Heard it all before, before
Heard it all before

[Verse One: Fashawn]
Every time that I’m doing right
You assume that I’m doing wrong
Well as long as I’m doing me
Never mind that shit you be on
See I got a problem with liars
Might as well be wearing a wire
Sick and tired of be sick and tired
I’m uninspired, dealing with smiling faces
For dollars they silent fading
I can let it continue or simply I can replace it
Take it back to the essence, take it back to the basics
To procrastinating, knew all my addicts was waiting
Was that you was watching the news, it’s merely just entertainment
And fuck reading bout history and when I went out and made it
Go get your head out the clouds, keep both feet on the pavement
Often get lost in the world, prisoner of temptation
You prolly coulda, shoulda, woulda, but nigga you didn’t
Used to be a reflection now you just an image
Got me second guessing, answering the question
I’m just searching for the truth
Could you point me in his direction please?

[Hook]
It’s my song to talk
Could you point me in his direction please?
I don’t know no other way
It's all I know
Every word that you could say
Heard it all before, before
Heard it all before, come again, before
Heard it all before
Heard it all before
Heard it all before

[Verse Two: Fashawn]
Said you gon do it, then do it, all about showing and proving
You really give it your all, there’s always room for improvement
Are you on a hallucinogenic, seeing illusions
In a state of euphoria, under the influence
Kid it's a sobering feeling, when you--hold up let me finish
When you focused on winning, and you know it’s no limits
And nothing’s guaranteed, this shit can change in an instant
Rather I go with the major or I stay independent
All nobody can win it, all I need is my team and maybe a personal Jesus
I don’t know what to believe in, constantly chasing and dreaming
Day to day and the reason, to get this paper I’m eager
Mis-educated by teachers, who said my destiny was death or incarceration
But damn, didn’t I make it, got no congratulations
Wondering who I can put my faith in
Thinking about all this time that I’m wasting
Can we have a conversation please?

[Hook]
It’s my song to talk (could you point me in his direction please?)
I don’t know no other way
Every word that you could say
Heard it all before, before
Heard it all before, come again, before
Heard it all before
Heard it all before
Heard it all before
Make em' believe [X6]
