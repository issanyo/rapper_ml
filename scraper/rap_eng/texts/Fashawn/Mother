[Intro]
(Yeah, uh, hit me!)
What Up, Ex?
Ayo I just wanna talk about something real quick
This one right here, it's kinda like- it's kinda like a love song, you know what I'm sayin?
It sorta hurts though
Bear with me... check it out

[Verse 1]
Raised three snotty-nosed kids on your own
We never had a house, we always had a home
At least when you were there, half the time you was gone
I tried to cook my own supper, burnt my hand on the stove
I had clothes, what I needed, but never what I wanted
First day of school I stunted, cause you went out and hunted
Got me the latest toy, and no matter how old I get
I'm still your baby boy, somehow you stayed employed
And never worked a 9-to-5, and never wondered why
Black queen, crack fiend, all the while you was high
Hardly ever wiped my tears, never let you see me cry
Not one man in the house, so that spot I occupied
How could I not acknowledge your work?
A Mason jar used to steal the dollars out of her purse
It breaks my heart to see you struggle with your addiction
And still I care for you
Despite all of the drama, I'll always be there for you

[Hook] x2
You are
Everything and anything to me
Little lady, can't you see?
You are
You're my momma, and I'm your son
Thank God, cause he only gave us one

[Verse 2]
You remember that night, I took your glass pipe
Threw it against the street light, you probably might
I thought saved your life, Tasha called CPS, big sis was fed up
With her mama, tried to visit, but they usually didn't let her
Life could have been worse and life could have been better
Loved her unconditionally, since the day that we met her
At the parent and teacher meetings, you might have never seen her
Still, she gave me life, guess that's why they call her Vida
I been to two of your weddings, none of them guys still around
How can I mirror that, how could I let you down
Even though you left me home alone for nights at a time
I'm shedding tears as I'm reciting each line
Apparently, it's never too young to become a parent for some
Had me at 15 going on 21
Had an older sister even had an older brother
Met a lot of men and women but there's no one like my mother

[Hook]
