[Intro: Fashawn]
Uh... yeah... uh-huh
I wanna dedicate this one to you
For stayin' down
Uh uh-huh
For always catching me when I fall
Uh...(Check it out)...yeah

[Verse 1: Fashwan]
You never have to worry
I'll be here till the end
To catch you when you fall
On me you could depend
Picture me leaving your side
Not in a million eons
Try to be a good daddy
At least a shoulder to lean on, when she need one
There's nothing that I won't, or can't do
For my little angel
And that beautiful womb she came through
Most men never stick around
Second you need 'em them niggas nowhere to be found
But I plan to be the papa that my father just couldn't be
Teach her right, read her right, tie up her shoe-strings
So she doesn't trip
Just hold on to my grip, grip
If you shall ever stumble or slip
Baby, I'll catch you when you fall

[Chorus: Tony Williams]
All of the scars will fade away
Brighter tomorrow is promised today
The words that you're singing (singing) [X3]
May light your way
All of the scars will fade away
Brighter tomorrow is promised today
The words that you're singing (singing) [X3]
May light your way

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
When the going gets tough
Sometimes you just need a friend
Through thick and thin you know
On them you could depend
If ever in need of money
Couple dollars I can lend
As long as you ride with me
Homie, bucket or a Benz
I be there in a min'
All you gotta do is call
No matter the weather
Winter, spring, summer and fall
For you I'd take a bullet
'Cause I know you'd do the same
And the love is unconditional
Hope it never changes
Thank God for family
Most importantly mine
For never leaving my side
Even when I was out of my mind
All of my fans, and friends
And people who I rely on
If I ever ever get too high
Will you catch me when I fall

[Chorus: Tony Williams]
All of the scars will fade away
Brighter tomorrow is promised today
The words that you're singing (singing) [X3]
May light your way
All of the scars will fade away
Brighter tomorrow is promised today
The words that you're singing (singing) [X3]
May light your way

[Hook: Tony Williams, Fashawn]
Hmm...
Who's gonna catch you if you fall...
Who's gonna catch you if you fall...
Who's gonna catch you if you fall...
Catch you if you fall... (because you're never fallin' down)
Who's gonna catch me if I fall...
Who's gonna catch me if I fall...
Who's gonna catch me if I fall...
(Uh) Catch me if I fall...

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
This is dedicated to the men
Who gotta make them ends meet
Either, working that 9 to 5
Or hustlin' in the streets
Odd jobs that
Help keep food on the table
Smiles on everyone's faces
You do it because you're able
Who gon' catch you when you fall
Or need a helpin' hand
Pressures of being a man
I now understand. And
To all my sisters, let nobody steer you wrong
If a brother can't learn to love you
Then leave him alone
Raising kids on your own
A queen, you deserve a throne
Before she takes care of self
Takes care of home
Damn, I just hate to see you drownin' in your sorrow
Well I promise you a better tomorrow
Someone to catch you when you fall

[Chorus: Tony Williams]
All of the scars will fade away. (will fade away)
Brighter tomorrow is promised today. (ohh yeah)
The words that you're singing (singing) [X3]
May light your way
All of the scars will fade away. (scars gonna fade away)
Brighter tomorrow is promised today. (today)
The words that you're singing (singing) [X3]
May light your way

[Hook: Tony Williams, Fashawn]
Hmm...
Who's gonna catch you if you fall... (gonna catch you if you fall)
Who's gonna catch you if you fall... (who's gonna catch you if you fall)
Who's gonna catch you if you fall... (catch you if you fall)
Catch you if you fall... (because you're never fallin' down)
Who's gonna catch me if I fall... (catch me if I fall)
Who's gonna catch me if I fall... (who's gonna catch me if I fall)
Who's gonna catch me if I fall... (gonna catch me if I fall)
Catch me if I fall... (because I'm never fallin' down)
