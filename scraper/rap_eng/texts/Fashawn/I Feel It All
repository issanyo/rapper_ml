[Intro]

Come mix it up
Terry Urban
The lead crew
Now I'm just living my life
One drum kick at a time
Please someone give me a light
There's so much shit on my mind
Skate down the block
Some believe it's a crime
But my big homie told me
You gotta stay on the grind
If you wanna eat go cop a few
Get your hands on a 9
Millimeter if you feel you a G
Then that's how we survive
Back then I was so immature
I even dabbled in crime
Now that I'm all grown up I know wrong from right

[Verse 1]

I adapted to all the stress and pressure combined with it
So I return back in effect, no he didn't
The difference is I do what I like
You need permission
Fuck your criticism
This is my life I'm on a mission
The foundation, knowledge, understanding and wisdom
The basis of healthy living, practice forgiven
In the midst of all the snakes in the grass
We call pretenders
My 3rd eye see 'em before they enter

[Bridge]

Wiser than I've ever been before
That's right
A lot of blood sweat and tears and long nights but
I made it through

[Verse 2]

Now when my clouds are gray
And the sun don't surface
And the moon don't shine
I am a whole another person
Probably drunk off Heen
You wanna know why I'm swerving
Guess it's my imperfections that make me almost perfect
They don't make 'em like me no more, for sure
One of a kind
And the bad thing about it is I know
Therefore I never sleep, hardly eat
Never missing a chance to shine
Progressing I'll never die

[Bridge/Outro]

You know through the music we live forever
I'll go when I'm ready
Way smarter now, can't fuck with me
That's right
I didn't stop man
24-7, 365
It's hard work
Hope you know that
I'll go when I'm ready man
I'll never let these cats take me out, take me down
I'm smarter than that
I'm stronger than that
Yeah
Ya'll hear me out there
It's Fash-shawn
