[Intro: Fashawn] x3
So good to have you back

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
While you was waiting in the wind, so was I
Figured I'd leave you hanging, rather than tell a lie
Cause that'd be lame; from complaining I had to refrain
Debated never rapping again
For a second thought Fash was the same, giving a fuck
Less about the flash of the fame
The more I give, the more I gain
The more I spill, the more I'm drained
I had to make the streets wait even longer, change the release date
Guess you can call it fashionably late,may my passion never fades
Managing this madness on my plate
I couldn't have imagined having to start putting my foot in niggas' asses
We cook it and we give it to the masses, can't wait to download it, rip it out the plastic
Classic is what they get, palms itching till they get it in their grip
Never waiting in vein, no, never waiting in vein, nah, never waiting in vein

[Hook: Fashawn]
Just a matter of time, before the game is mine
Never waiting in vein, no, I know one day I'mma shine
Just a matter of time, before the game is mine
Never waiting in vein, no (x4)
Never waiting in vein

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Waited 25 years for this 15 minutes of fame
Please don't tell me that I did it in vein
Sorta over prepared 'fore I entered the game
Before Twitter they would mention my name
I was hitting on the bench, still
Either to exhibit my pen skills, dream about landing a big deal
I knew eventually it would come
Matter of time till they see I'm the one
What a masterpiece I've become, thought I was done?
Darling I ain't even begun to do the damage that I plan to do
Once I got my feet, the planet didn't plan to move
Instead of wishing on a star, I followed my intuition and went hard
Ended up ascending past Mars
Succeeded without the marketer schemes, starving artist with his heart on his sleeve
Saw it over and over in my mind, hungry for that moment to shine
Never waiting in vein, no, never waiting in vein, nah, never waiting in vein

[Hook]
