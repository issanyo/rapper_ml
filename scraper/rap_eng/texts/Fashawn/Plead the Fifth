[Intro: Codany Holiday]
It wasn't me
I plead the fifth

[Hook: Codany Holiday]
Said I don't know, it wasn't me
I plead the fifth

[Verse 1: Zumbi]
All quiet in the court now
Please take a seat, face the judge who presides in the courthouse
Prosecution to the stand in the next case
Big business versus woman and man
Now this includes the rule of pharmaceuticals
Medicines approved to use but they just neuter you
Mask the symptoms but they don’t treat the root
Of the problem, the object hide the truth
Mass addiction go get your prescription
Ritalin or vicodin, there’s something for the life your in
Dope pusher with a PhD
Synthetic warfare on your chi, come follow me
It’s for the jury plus the mamas and the babies
Sometimes I look around, it’s like we all plum crazy
Motrin so the pain can float away
And I complain, but I’m the same they addicted me
To the numb out, at times I want to dumb out
I try to speak the truth in the booth spit a lung out
It’s business read the quotes in the fine print
The corporates stand accused, what you plead? The fifth

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I plead the fifth, I know my motherfucking rights
Ain't no justice it's just ice, so what's right?
And what's wrong, sometimes I feel like fuck life
It's like the door to opportunity done shut tight
Back to baggin', crack mathematics
Trying' to keep it intact while this economy's collapsin'
While we swallowin' klonopin's and aspirin
Drowning' in disaster, we're frowning' while they're laughing
It's astoundin' how it happens, especially to young black men
Get us in they trappers, mentally it's a massacre
And as far as the judicial system, it is inaccurate
Political savages fill up prisons like pamplates
So it's me against the system, me against the world
Risk my freedom just to feed my little girl, only reason
So you know what amendment I'm pleadin'
Remember I'm a heathen, death before dishonor, repeat it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The Grouch]
Jury asking me why I drive a gas hog
Why I'd ask the shop to lie so I could pass smog
The earth's hurt, I know the repercussions
And so do y'all, we need some deep discussion
She keeps sufferin' and we keep hustling'
Even if it means other beings take a fuckering
I'm leakin' substance but reakin' of a stench
I can't stand myself, y'all stinkin' up the bench, too
It's just the evil that men do
Murderin' our mother for greed and the ends soon
If we don't switch our please to guilty and then change
It ain't enough to know better and just say (I plead the fifth)

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Casual]
Catalog the chronicles honorably your honor
I done learned to keep my karma right, armalite AR
And all my life I done said it before
I done beat the law I'm Tariq the Moor
The streets, it seems that they're ready to talk
I can't relate the dream state makes everything seem fake
Your body into gas as fast as cremation
(i) feel elation, erasin' freebasin' freemason's
A true friend, I blow herb
Medu nen: that's no words
And the crews like goldy in the realm of the rosi
While the chicks try and hold me like composure
All the little stories your tellin', irrelevant, you're lyin'
Intelligent design, the alien invasion
Stress, I got greys
Now I had the barber hit the line with the razor
Rehearsal? Homie he late, but the verse gon' be great
Who plead the fifth? Y'all speakin' the first 48
