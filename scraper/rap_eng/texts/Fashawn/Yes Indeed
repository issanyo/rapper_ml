[Verse 1: Fashawn]
With hopes of one day owning a yacht, drop an O on the block
Get low from the cops, y’all know I been hot
Since 1st Street, over 20 deep in the spot
See what the turf breeds, black sheep, bad seeds
I had steez, since the days of baggy jeans
Tall tees, oversized caps, that was me
Gradually, I get some clothes that fit
Guess I changed my style, let me see, that’s it
It was the G’s, the trips, overseas, the chicks
Stopped squeezing the pen and started deleting my friends
Foes, numbers out of my Blackberry Bold
Unplug the phone, I don’t want to be reached
In deep, close my eyes and let my pen dream
You couldn’t scribble a better scenery
As I paid my dues, some paid cash, I caught fire
They got gassed, I just laughed

[Hook]
The man on the bottom finally made it to the top
I’m just laughing at these haters ‘cause I know that they shocked
The underdog finally made it to the top
I’m just laughing at these haters ‘cause I know that they hot

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Opus of a ghetto boy, the realest
Snatch my strings from Geppetto's ploys, plots, and schemes
Steadily intervene, to feel them ring
And a nigga ill, like Mr. Clean
From Philly to Philistine
If you feel it, feel esteemed
I’m a delicate, intricate, full of green
Decorated soldier, militant since a teen
Roll like the heads of kings from guillotines
Where boys from the hood and girls from [?]
The company I keep keep me comfortably in team
In tune with the times that we currently [?]
Both sides of the story, I’m reporting from between
Yes, and this pursuit is the proof
And representative of my Midwest roots
Coming home to roost with a great big bowl of the soul’s chicken noodle soup
You can call me Lupe, I keep you in the loop (ayy)
Keep you in the news, to keep you out the noose
Mister Fabby Davis, your mama has arrived
Salutations to The Bay, Mac Dre is alive

[Hook]
The man on the bottom finally made it to the top
I’m just laughing at these haters ‘cause I know that they shocked
The underdog finally made it to the top
I’m just laughing at these haters ‘cause I know that they hot

[Verse 3: Mistah F.A.B.]
Hey look I started from the bottom now I’m here
Hey but I really started in the rear
In the back like where them crackers wanted Rosa to sit
But out the park I arose from the bench
I’m the phoenix, I arose from the pit
And my clothes didn’t fit, and my shows wasn’t thick, and my flows didn’t spit
I was rambling words, not making any sense
I was stuck on the curb with a pocket full of lint
But mama look at me now, little Stan is the man
And people go out they way to take pictures and shake my hand
I could run for mayor and possibly even win
Liberty is a little me with your gram
Smile mama, smile mama, you can rest in peace
Just wanted to make you happy, now mama just look at me
I’m doing songs with Lupe, oh it’s a new day
Remember me, Clyde Carson, and Balance was the new Bay?
Road trips with Gary Archer, arguing with D-Ray
Now it’s million dollar deals, my lawyer closing on a threeway
Mama, remember we used to hit the Warriors game?
Now they won it all and I was sitting by LeBron James
Lebron James, Lebron James
Front row Fabby
