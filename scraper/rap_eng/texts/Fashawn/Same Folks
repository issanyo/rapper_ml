[Intro]
You're never gonna blow up...

[Verse 1: Evidence and Fashawn]
(Evidence)
We ain't same folks, chain spokes and car doors
Its ain't Star Wars, it's Reservoir Dogs
I got that feeling Fash, hands to the ceiling pact

(Fashawn)
I roll with winners, Ev, just check the score board
Drop it in four stores, floor like a Ford Explorer
Hit the gas hear my engine roar

(Evidence)
Hit the task with a vengeance, still less is more
Take heed to the message taught, that's what the lessons for

(Fashawn)
Engineer press record, I set it off like a mother fucking broke alarm
Pass the mic let me exercise my vocal chords
The weather man predicted we finna have a storm

(Evidence)
Cats and dogs, they got high with the rifle
Different ways to get there, never thought of flight school while I'm on the red eye
Looking out my left eye, think of Lisa Lopez, staring at the clouds then lose my focus
I hit the roaches in the ash tray, spray the bugs with the bat spray
Thumps in the drum until my last day

(Fashawn)
In the zone smoking, dumbing out doors open
Left coastin', campaigning and promotin'
Champagne and mimosas, Hennessy and cola
A remedy for most of us with fucked up emotions
It kills me, I'll never be important as the ocean
No matter how many millions they put up for promotion
I'm living for the future, they living for the moment

(Evidence)
I'm livin' to be driven just hit 'em with devotion
There's different tokens, hoping one pays the game
The other is a little taste of memory lane
Some wishin' their position is made, new kitchen and chain
Same price bitch decision a day, I'm the needle still hittin' the hay
They never dock my pay, while I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay

[Chorus]
You better listen, listen up
Listen, lend me your ears, listen
Lets get one thing clear
We not the same, and I ain't holdin' back, listen
I'm lettin' go, listen
I'm stayin' here,listen
As long as your willin' to listen

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Whether blue or white collar workers, I relate with oddest verses
Demanded back by female fans, witness matrimony, wedding bands, hands clap
My lands stacked fat, with no resale plans
I stepped out of my house, quick fast with the passion
The name's Shawn, stop callin 'him Fashion
I stay strong went longer than a past time
From the lip, it was written in class time
It's been that, skinny struggled in gym class
Many bunnies were already on my dick fast
Full of cum, maybe someday I'll hit that
Years pass, she's and lady with a new mismatch
Son she won, I watch the sun shine oddly
The clock said time don't waste for nobody
I miss shit being modest, paying homage, I guess the hour glass was just being honest

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
I know tomorrow ain't promised, sometimes I wanna escape
Vacate to the Bahamas, sip on some Grand Marnier
Somewhere else for a day, I keep so much bottled in don't know what to say
I hit the 41 cruise around town in a daze, with a blunt in my ear and a frown on my face
Found out my baby got a baby on the way, now I'm trying to find a job
Been considerin' moving yay, just the trials and tribulations of a nigga from CA
Same shit different day, 'nother sentence on the page, then it's to the stage
Every record we drop, but question it not
Me and Evidence connecting the dots, so just stop and

[Chorus]
You better listen, listen up
Listen, lend me your ears, listen
Let's get one thing clear
We not the same, and I ain't holdin' back, listen
I'm lettin' go, listen
I'm stayin' here, listen
As long as your willin' to listen
