[Verse 1]
Dreaming, plotting on my arrival, but reality bites
My main focus is survival at this time of my life
Swear I'm my own worse rival
Even grab the Henny every time I'm feeling bottled
How come I ain't hit the lotto, at least come up on a scheme?
Least I ain't doing time, could be worse, keep in mind
They say I'm doing fine, but a nigga need cream, no
Choice but to grind, time I'mma gather up the team
I'm tired of seeing niggas mope around, I'm hungry so I hold it down
Money on my mind so I'm gritting, gotta get it
Early 'bout my hustle game, tryna scrape up some change
You can hate it or love it but this is how I'm living, nigga

[Hook]
If I die tonight, would you celebrate my life
Or just let a brother pass? I need to know
Would I be forgotten or would you hold me down?
Sorry but I gotta ask, I need to know

[Verse 2]
In life, gotta stay on your toes
Stay tight with the fam, keep an eye on your foes
We live in a cold world, it's hard to trust a soul
So I stay on the low, sucka free how I roll
Allergic to these hoes, keep my dick in my jeans
Away from them gold diggers, gotta stick with my queens
Might think it's gold just because how I gleam
But it's just an illusion, yeah, a bunch of confusion
It's hard to be humble when your stomach is growling
While you juggling mountains and you just wanna drop
Then you reach deep inside and you grab that intuition
All them late nights wishing and hoping the pain stop but

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Death is only a part of life, I don't know why you scared
Shit you better get prepared for the reaper
I'd rather know he coming to get me before he creep up
Go out with a bang take my last hit of reefer
Kiss my momma on the cheek, tell my niggas
"I'll see ya up in Heaven, hold it down 'til we meet up"
Again, I'll be somewhere in the clouds with my feet up
Going bar for bar with Pac, laughing with Jesus
Away from the struggling, the drama and the grieving
At last I can finally be at peace
Far away from them heaters who try to bring me down
All the trial and tribulations of the streets, I'm finally free

[Hook]
