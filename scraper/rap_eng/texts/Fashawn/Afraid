[Chorus]
You were so afraid
You were so afraid
For what?
You were so afraid
You were so afraid
For what?

[Verse 1]
Uh, you know what comes with success
Not just the funds, but the guns in the vest
No more fun, you've got sons to protect
The crackers wanna see you hung by the neck
What the fuck y'all expect?
Besides, for me to pull out the five
Leave you dead or alive, nigga?
This is as real as it gets
Forty in the 'frigerator
With a Philly to twist
I'm scared, today could've been my last day
Ha, same spliff different ashtray
Still gettin' dope boy you can ask track
No index, let the gas break
No custodians, just the street's rule bruh
Guardian angel and my grim reaper
And this shit gets deeper
Then a tidal wave, pretending to be brave
You afraid nigga

[Chorus]
You were so afraid
You were so afraid
For what?
You were so afraid
You were so afraid
For what?

[Verse 2]
I heard this cat pilage out in California
Everybody paralyzed by the paranoia
Shit, I guess my mother should panic
'Cause these days nigga ain't the only one with a cannon
I admit I was afraid
Too many visits to the cemetery pay
Teary eyed, spilling liquor on the grave
In memory of all the history made
Expect the unexpected
From a street dream to a death wish
Now, nothing's the same
Notice every motherfucker is talkin' a chain
And anybody can get it
Seen a nigga catch a body and then hop in a Civic
His only fear, that the coppers would get him
Came back and he shot every witness
Now he's prayin' that God'll forgive him
Who would've thought, nigga?

[Chorus]
You were so afraid
You were so afraid
For what?
You were so afraid
You were so afraid
For what?

[Outro]
I have no motherfucking fears
I have no fear
I have only ambition
And I want my...and I will do anything to protect and feed my family
And these niggas represent a threat
And I won't be bought on this
