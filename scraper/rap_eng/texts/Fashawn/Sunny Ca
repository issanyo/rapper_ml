[Intro]
Say CA...all day!
Shawn, Ex, what up
CA all day

[Verse 1 - Fashawn]
I wake up in the mornin' with a appetite
For money, gotta make sure that he right
Best weed keep me higher then a satellite
Where I'm from, life's a gamble, grab the dice
'Fore I leave, pray to God, then I grab my Nikes
Remember those times I knew I had to fight
Nigga might run up on you at the traffic light
Wind up in some heavy shit if you packin' light
Now a days, strap up, they ain't packin' nice
Streets made of ice, slip, that's your life
To live and die in CA, from the home of PA
Guaranteed to make it pop like a fuckin' briefcase
Come where I stay, not too far from the Bay
About two-hundred-twenty miles from LA
You'll find FC in the middle of the state
Valley of the kings where it all takes place

[Hook 1]
And they say that it never rains in Central California, California
And they say that if you don't watch your back, they'll run up on ya, run up on ya
And they say that it never rains in Central California, California
And they say that if you don't watch your back, they'll run up on ya, run up on ya
Take your life, take your soul
So I think twice, the streets is cold
And that's how it goes
Down in Sunny California, California

[Verse 2 - Co$$]
I’m from the city of the goon, where the deuce heavy rippin’
Trey-times movin’ and the tools ain’t for fixin’
I was raised Christian, Angels with them Devils on the shoulder
Good aim and the gang’s they religion
The home of the rollin’ 0’s (Oh!)
Where the Chevrolet rollin’ twenty-fours
Smell the doja smoke
I watched my thug partners die here, so we gon’ choke fire
And put it in the sky like the homie’s soul
The Park’s heartless, broad day or the darkness
They won’t hesitate to put some holes in your mind
I’m reminded of the days, the summer of the tiny loc
When niggas carry bats and wore hats with the A’s
Now they parlay, with gauges, macs and the K’s - shit
They don’t carry straps on the waist no more
They carry choppers in the trunk
But some things never change, ‘cuz niggas still hate po-po
I’m from the home of the car clubs
I’m from the home of the illest MC’s - get your bars up
I’m in the heart of the heart of the city
Got them L-dot, A-dot, Park niggas with me
Feel me

[Hook 2]
And they say that it never rains Southern California
And they say that if you don’t run your back they’ll run up on ya
And they say that if you don’t run your back they’ll run up on ya
And they say that it never rains in Southern California
And take your life, take your soul
So I think twice, the streets is cold
And that’s how it goes down in Sunny California, California

[Verse 3 - Mistah F.A.B.]
Now you can find me in the end zone, right in the black hole
Rollin’ up a Barney, emptyin’ out tobacco
‘Cuz I be in the streets like a speed bump
Mistah always got it, holla at me if you need some
Free my brother Antoine,  it’s me and Fashawn
Addicted to retail, respect the fashion
Golden State, golden child, Eddie Murphy saved me (Pause)
Crazy applause, I am rod (?)
G4 flights fly high above y’all
Black Superman flow - high above the law
Windy in my city, never been to the Chi
In the itty-bitty city by the water, gettin’ high
I was raised by pimps, so the game I know
So if I’m raised by pimps, make it rain, hell no
Tickle me Elmo, but leggo my Eggo
Cali sunny days, from the Bay down to Fresno

[Hook 3]
And they say that it never rains Northern California
And they say that if you don’t run your back they’ll run up on ya
And they say that if you don’t run your back they’ll run up on ya
And they say that it never rains in Northern California
And take your life, take your soul
So I think twice, the streets is cold
And that’s how it goes down in Northern California

[Outro]
I'm from the home of the three strikes
And before you trust a nigga, better think twice, think twice
From the home of the three strikes
And before you trust a nigga, better think twice, better think twice
