[Intro]
"We played the part of lovers
You gave all your love and you made it seem right
You made me a man oh so young in my life"

"Why you don't know who I am?
I-I'll see you, I know exactly where you're at
That so you don't have to wonder and try to find out who I am
You will SEE who I am, I will tell you who I am"

"Then who are you?"

[The Alchemist]
I am
The maestro that's composin these dope jams
Got fiends tappin they arms for that dope slam
On the low like the Witness Protection pro-gram
Cliques to guerillas with killas, let 'em ride out
Park the tank, open the latch and then I climb out
To the atmosphere so I could really find out
Who's schemin when I walk around with the shines out
I seen 'em, pay no attention I make boss moves
Pay kings no attention cause the cash rules
Kingpin I'm in on anything that moves
It's the Anchorman, I deliver the bad news
At least a couple thousand in my pocket, no less
Can't even stop to take a breather cause it's no rest
Where I'm at, my position's what I know best
From California, but I represent the whole West

[Fashawn]
Uh, they like god-damn
Who gives a fuck about them blocks, you ran
How you walk around with choppers like it's I-ran
You grew up in the burbs, you are not the man
I was in the kitchen, pots, pans
See I'm 'bout action, you plot, plan
Pull up to the spot, I stop, they scram
Got 'em out in Philly like ock's not playing
High definition like Com-Cast
Left Coast District, on smash
I'm the next addition, just do the math
The only missing link to the movement was Fash'
You can tell by the bass that's A-L-C
Ask E-V, I'm on my J-O-B
So it's never a drought, fiends don't sweat
Eastside, but I represent the whole F
Product of them Grizzly City pro-jects
I get a good sleep when my soul at rest
CA but I represent the whole West
Coast to the death, fuck you expect?
It's the F

"That so you don't have to wonder and try to find out who I am
You will see who I am" "Then who are you?"

[Evidence]
I am
Slow Flow that's controlling all these live jams
Use myself once again 'til I'm tried, and
Proved, but don't lose, he gets vio-lent
A starving student that won't move, I'm like why not?
Go to the place then let him ride out 'til I'm high -- Got
My name in hall of fame, CA and I'mma ride out
Eyes open 20/20, he's a white owl
No joking, money first, I'm like a tri-band
Cell phone on the other side of your land
I'm programmed, either way I hold my own cam
And film, ain't no fucking stand I bought my own land
Still never ran and never will, god-damn
Never gonna knock me off my throne, Plan
B is not an option I'm a grown man
Known for moving weight, so I'm pro-grams
