[Intro]
("We coolin’ and rap music is rulin’
And we stand here and we represent rap music because, um
It’s kinda—it’s kinda different
It’s like the way Rock n’ Roll was back in the days
The way they wouldn’t accept Rock & Roll…")

[Verse]
I’m from the lower bottoms of rap
Where they slang Oxycontins and they pockets is fat
From steady clockin’, stocking caps over the face
You gotta watch ‘em, young thugs smother the strip
Then count the profit—do or die, that’s the only
Most are plottin’, organized like the mobsters
Keep an eye out for fake friends when you tryna make ends
Meet on your own two feet
Some good ganja in my lungs, now the cipher complete
I hit the corner like a meteorite, late night
I exhale a cloud of smoke and let my mind take flight
Windpipe’s like “No other kid could clear, I’m precise”
Give me a second, let me bless ‘em with the lessons I write
My intellect gets to flex when I step on the mic
It’s seduction, breathe on the track, no interruptions
Streets hot, got the blood in my vein bubblin’
Gun in my jeans, I can’t help it, I’m troublesome
I hit the alleyway and see my brother Corleone
Said, “It’s about to go down, you oughta head home”
Before I knew it, niggas shootin’, I had to keep it movin’
Nowadays, AK’s kind of remind me of music
Got these niggas in the shell shock
Every station, barbershop to cell block
Ain’t get the memo, then I slip one in your mailbox
Red hot—think not?
