Can I talk my shit again
I just wanna be El Chapo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Sipping on my vino, listening to Chalino
Gripping on my dick and it's just as big as my ego
She know I'm snatchin' Fritos
It's me ho I'm like the Repo
Man, goddamn, my life is so illegal
Politickin' with Vito, reminisce over Dupree
Desperado bandito, only titles that suit me
Truthfully I'm yo idol, you're homo I'm homicidal
You 21 with a bullet, I'm 25 with a rifle
You Martin Lawrence, I'm Michael Jackson Jordan and Connelly
Shit, I'm an anomaly, definitely and probably puff
The smoke out some chronic, puffin' out of leaves
Leaves ashes on my Versace and vinyl sheets
Here's an alarm clock for sleeping on Shawn
Funk flex you still owe me a bomb
Drop, I spit lava at the sun up we all hot
More fire, can't stop 'em
Can't knock 'em, I'm God I'm lost prophets
You floss, you lost profit
Boss, a don logic
I'm hard, you hardly at all so
I calmly let off
With the bar up I can let this stay on
Teach a seminar on how to seize a nigga's heartbeat
This ain't art, this is Shark Week
No it's arc meets, come on the cross seater of a Hummer
A heartbeat, life of the dark streets
A cypher at Rock Creek, park on concrete
Heart with long reach, scar, that's all gs
Real niggas acknowledge me
Bitch niggas possibly in pursuit of my property
Property, I'm talking properties
Snot nosed at the dice game, no Monopoly
Rather, Bart Simpson or Homer still on my Odyssey
Uh, peep the philosophy
Deeper than Socrates
Wisdom and knowledge leak from my noggin
I gotta read, never follow
Hoes we let 'em swallow
Twist the dro go slow, blow us at the yard go!
This is rapping for real, nigga
Like Papoose when he was actually ill
A$AP if he trill, you're now rockin' with the letter F
The flyest from JFK to LAX
It's the West
Coast, mother fucka

El Chapo, nigga
El Chapo, baby
Chap, Chap, El Chapo, baby

Oh what a killin'
Oh what a villain
