[Intro: Fashawn]
Hold up I think I need to lift this mic up a little
Uh, church, oh yeah, [?]

[Verse: Fashawn]
Fash here; Kashmir, cut from a rich cloth
You a pup, I'm a big dog, I'm just dusting my clip off
I pull up, you should get lost, nigga, or get your wig tossed
Hollow tips'll leave your rib cage criss-crossed
Puffing my cigar, pull a nug out the big jar
Paint a portrait like Renoir, I've been raw
Top of the hill like Sen Dog, the kid's gone
And leave the penicillin for their sick thoughts
Can't sit calm, this a motion picture y'all, not a sitcom
That's Top Ramen, homie, This Filet Mignon
The dominant one, your timing is done
When I vomit on top of the drum, your noggin get numb
The Prophet, sincere since the saga begun
Starting with nada, listening to Nautilus drum
Gunning my Nautica, youngin', fuck what you though it was
I should have called the pastor, instead I called the plug
Respect, money and power what he represents
Y'all expected him to never win, now it's
Po for President, Po for President, Po for President, Chapo for President
Uh, nothing's been the same ever since
He started this campaign and y'all elected him, who?
Po for President, Po for President, Po for President, Chapo for President

[Outro: Sample]
Joaqu√≠n "El Chapo" Guzman, the world's most ruthless druglord. Focusing on five wire-taps, the D.E.A., U.S. Immigration, and Mexican officials tracked Guzman down to this motel in Mazatlan, Mexico. It was a single wire-tap linking authorities directly to where Guzman was standing, room 401
