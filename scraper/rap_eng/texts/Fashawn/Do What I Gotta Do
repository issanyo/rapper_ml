[Hook: Fashawn]
Some of my niggas bang, some of my niggas slang
(?) more of the same, just gotta maintain
Homie do what you gotta do
Homie do what you gotta do
Stay on my grind, watch you waiting in line
Got a 24/7 (?) do a 9 to 5
I just do what I gotta do
I said I do what I gotta do

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
They got caught up in a life where it's hard to tell wrong from right
All along, they was lost, lust in cars and ice
Young niggas, in the gutter, the lawless type
Drug charges, put 'em behind bars
And kites to all my dogs, cause ain't no love lost in fights
Among each other like brothers, get it on, we tight
Do whatever for a dollar, whether we slang dolo
Or hustling any product, nothing we can't cope with
I’m through with maintaining, trying to live it to the limit
Pasta and shrimp and like a mobster in Venice
No offense to my brothers with 9-to-5’s
Some want it all, some just want to survive
But me? I’d rather roll up in a Bimmer
My momma's like I don’t need it
In my heart I agree, but could you picture me leaning? 
It’s sort of bittersweet, stuck American dreaming 
I’m just trying to get a piece nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Some of my homies slang, some of them fiends
I look at what I became, kinda in between
Stuck, caught up in the game, living the street dream
I'm just trying to balance it out like a triple beam
Keep so much on my mind I might go and do a crime
Motherfuckers telling me don't rely on your rhymes
When the industry declining, niggas ain't getting signed
I'm either one step ahead or one behind
A couple thousand dollars is just not enough
I come from the bottom so I gotta stunt
Phone buzzing, oh damn, what everybody want?
My bad, niggas ain't seen me in about a month
I've been hustling, trying to get it on a roll
You'd literally be amazed how quick I go through a zone
But "more money, more problems to fix" --
We all know the motto, still we trying to get rich

[Hook]
