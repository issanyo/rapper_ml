[Intro: Fashawn]
Yeah... yeah... young F
Uh huh... yeah... uhh... uhh...

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
I knew you was mine the first time I gripped you
So many others on the menu but I had to have you
Case you ever snapped, I had two
One on the side, one just to ride when the other one acting up
Roll with me and got matching trunks
One clean, while the other one catching dust, uh
How about you and me, lets paint the town like
No one else exists but two when we skating around, right, huh
I can't deny it, nor keep quiet, this kind of love
No, she's so worth it, so perfect, can I tell you what you remind me of
You remind me

[Hook: Fashawn]
You remind me of my skateboard, baby
Cause I wanna ride ya, I wanna ride ya
Something like my grip tape, yeah
Cause I can't wait to lay you down
And I plan on grinding all night, yeah
Til the sun comes up or them cop lights flash
I'ma play the top, you just play the bottom
As long as you rolling, you know that I'm riding, uh huh

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I'm bout to slam it like a car door, keep you on all four
Give you it hardcore, how you deserve it
You already know the ledge, live life over the edge
I fucked with you on the reg, look at all this blood that I bled
I took the fall but I got up, brushed myself off and I kept skating
Right to where you were located, that ass deserving ovation
Time with you, never wasted
And our conversations are spoken mainly through body language
Concept is complicated, before I grind I'ma need some wax
This kind of coping don't crack
I prefer to keep my Vans on when I'm climbing in from the back
Could say I'm keeping her grounded, and she keep me on wood
My bottom bitch, I admit, I don't treat you like I should, nah

[Hook: Fashawn]
You remind me of my skateboard, baby
Cause I wanna ride ya, I wanna ride ya
Something like my grip tape, yeah
Cause I can't wait to lay you down
And I plan on grinding all night, yeah
Til the sun comes up or them cop lights flash
I'ma play the top, you just play the bottom
As long as you rolling, you know that I'm riding, uh huh

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
There should be no debate on where you came from
Birth place that Golden State, I roll the 8, point 5, 9 plied
No roller blades on my toes, before this thing went in vogue
I was still skating on bones, even had a brigade of my own
Anxious, couldn't wait to leave home, yeah
To hit a curb or some stairs, put the herb in the air
To drop in a verd I was scared
I had a board I named Medina after a broad I was seeing
Both remind me of each other
And the reason I knew it would end in peaces
And I'd have to find another, treat that rubber like a helmet
That was advice from my brother
Treat my wood like my woman, and my woman like my wood
Oh yeah she bad, she bad, and that's bad, meaning good
You remind me

[Hook: Fashawn]
You remind me of my skateboard, baby
Cause I wanna ride ya, I wanna ride ya
Something like my grip tape, yeah
Cause I can't wait to lay you down
And I plan on grinding all night, yeah
Til the sun comes up or them cop lights flash
I'ma play the top, you just play the bottom
As long as you rolling, you know that I'm riding, uh huh
