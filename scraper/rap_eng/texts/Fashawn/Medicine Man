[Verse 1:]
Maybe some methazine, definitely some marijuana
I’m extra key trust my pill clapper
No medaine, no no oxycontin
This purple weed, shrimp and lobster
Onion in my pocket but I ain’t pitchin', I'm rollin'
With the wisdom we smoking, loaded, spliff full of potent
I’m burnin' cookies when I’m dipping through 'Crisco and Oakland
Keep some grizzly city can’t forget what home is
Still my money crumble like sour D's
At a hundred mile per hour speed
I’ll be damned if I slow down
I won’t let you cowards breath
I sip champagne in the..loud pack this is how I speak
First class that’s how I fly
In my favorite flower cream


[Hook]
Slow it by the moe, call me medicine man
Oh you ain’t know the connect is my man
I keep my drugs free, drugs free
I live drugs free, every day drugs free
Slow it by the moe, call me medicine man
Oh you ain’t know the connect is my man
I keep my drugs free, drugs free
I live drugs free, every day drugs free

[Verse 2:]
Good on my funds, good in my lungs
Go to the hood for my drugs ’cause I’m good with the plot
It’s like a mac charger, abusing drugs
Found weed off the Twitter, call that computer love
I’m taking green everywhere with me that commuter stuff
That tree don’t even know where you’ve been that Bermuda bud
Smoking then I’m joking
’cause it’s potent and I got this shit from Cali
And I know just how to roll it
Grizzly city, smell the smoke when y'all approaching
Taylor gang we getting bucks 200 for 'em
Rolling weed and drinking gin and getting
All this fucking paper when I call it doing favors
’cause I’m balling plus I’m famous


[Hook]
