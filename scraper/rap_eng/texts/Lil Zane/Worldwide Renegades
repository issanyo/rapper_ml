Big Shady (no doubt) Lil' Z (somethin new)
The Highway meets College Park (yeah yeah shorty)
A-T-L is officially locked down - [IT'S GOIN DOWN]
Worldwide (fuck with layaway) - [ALL THE HENNY]
This is how we do it to em - [ALL THE HYDRO]
(we'll get a lady today) - [IT'S GOIN DOWN]
This is how we do it to em (believe that)
[ATLANTA STYLE BABY] (listen to this y'all)
No doubt, come on..

[Verse One]
College Park got control of me
Cause one of these snake niggas told on me
Seen me in the cut, then he rolled on me
Thought I was gone but they was only holdin me
Then it was told to me
Playboy, you only good as your team
You gotta leak find or seek
Hem it at the seams
I felt that, held back, went to the draft
Squeeze the juice from the peach when I pick my staff
Now I'm back with the slimiest, grimiest
Niggas who behind me is the ones who know what time it is
Red Clay Renegades, violence is Minute Maid(?)
Still thugged out, hooked on Alize and Hennessey
Strictly in it til the day the game finish me
Honk your horn if you feelin me
Put your fists in the sky, wave them deuces high nigga
Cause it ain't nuttin but that fire rolled up

Chorus: (repeat 2X)

I run with Worldwide Renegades, violence is Minute Maid(?)
Still thug livin, hooked on Alize and Hennessey
Stayin down til the day the game finish me
Honk your horn if you feelin me

[Verse Two]
I run with nothin but them woofer pushers, sittin on gold things
'drats give you slow brains who look like they on Soul Train
We run thangs, from the yea game to trickin
Don't come and think you stickin, below this Mason-Dixon it's rules
Born raised and die for it, hands kept high for it
Make niggas mother cry for it
You know like I know, respect these rules
Don't make Don Chilly lose his cool
If it's a nickel sold in the Park, I want two-fifty
And if you chief a blunt, chief it with me
Respect my Bankhead killaz, McKennasville grave fillers
Others cross the city pushin pealers
Cause I'm a true ATL-ier, Southside villain-er
Promise to check for shorty find out if they real or not
Come fake and get boxed, sent home
And watch the world spin like these twenty inch chromes

Chorus

[Verse Three]
I'mma have to slide with somethin, all the money in this game
Chicks callin my name, they want me bad, but I don't stop
I'm in my droptop V, I got a lot of things
To prove to niggas and you'll see, by the way it looks
A lot of niggas gon' be shook, don't disrespect
And no hard feelings took, I profile
While switchin styles in the crowd runnin wild
Have you niggas home dottin your rhyme, blowed out
Cause I showed out, so what'chu know about?
You gettin money or you assed-out
You sip a drink until you passed out
Circle the chiefers with no reefer
I'm in the corner where it's dark, preparin to spark
Niggas screamin let me hit it like I'm (?) or somethin
It ain't no limit when it come to how much niggas puffin
I mark the wall I dust em all
It's the Hennessey in me that'll blow the wall

Chorus 2X
