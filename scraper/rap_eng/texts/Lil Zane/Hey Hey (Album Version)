And the party is still jumpin
And the club it is about to close down

But the girls and I ain't ready to go
The night is young and we ain't tryna go home
So we gotta find another spot
Cos you know the party ain't gon' stop

Let's roll and not stop it's on to the next block
The party is hot and won't stop till 6 o clock

Everybody meet outside
Pump some music in your ride
Don't worry about the time

Forget about the club

And make our own hot spot

Pull the party up
And now it's up to us
To make our own fun
So stick around we just might
Do it all night
Can't go home with you
Came here with my crew
You know what we do
So if you're really down
Then gather round
And sing it out
Hey..

[Lil' Zane]
Uh, takes two to make a thing go right
If I'm correct then you single right, no
But you tryna do your thing tonight
We throw chips like it's bingo night
Anything you like
One night with me is bound to change your life
I got the whole club blocked ah
Benz, Coup, top uh
Cristal popped up
To set the scene and we not ball
Look Mami at ten
There's is so close lookin like Siamese Twins
Shorty stay focused keep your mind on me
Like your rent baby you're behind on me
Don't stop shorty, shorty
Just rock, rock your body
Know you had a couple shots before you got to the party
That's what it's all about
But the rule is no fallin out
You wildin out, baby slow up before you throw up
If you do I'm a act drunk wit your girl
Stumble off and hit your girl, throw your hands up

Ladies, Fellas get your hands up

All the ladies in the club
All the fellas show some love
All the ladies, all the ladies
All the fellas, all the fellas
All the ladies in the club
All the fellas show some love
All the ladies, all the ladies
All the fellas, all the fellas

Party ain't gon' stop
Cos we know how to keep it hot
Fellas show some love
Ladies lift your hands up
