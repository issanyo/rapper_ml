A whole relationship is based on trust
And for you I can never do to much
(Never)
You, kept my secrets and held me down
(Held me down)
Plus you stayed loyal when I wasn't around
(Ohh)
And I kno' it wasn't easy, I was never home
Concerts, videos and you was all alone
(All alone)
We spent many nights talkin' on tha phone
You started catchin' attitudes, I heard it in yo tone
(Ohh)
(Heard it in yo tone)
I use to tell you I be back when I could
(I be back)
You think I leave my baby girl in tha hood
(Hell no)
I would never do such things
I wanna show you what true love means
'Cuz I'ma put you on a pedistool, love so incredible
Victoria Secrets candy thongs so edible
Spiritual, mental, not just sexual
I'm denyin' all my plans to be next to you
Girl tonite I'm yours
I'm turnin' off my 2-way, turnin' off my phone
(Turnin' off my phone)
I tell my friends to leave

Plan my schedule up 'cuz tonite I swear I'm all yours
(Tonite)
(Tonite I'm all yours)
I made reservations at your favorite spot
Pull up, tip tha valley at tha parking lot
Got a table by tha fireplace, candlelit
Tonite we gon' stick to tha main script
(Ohh ohh oh)
Started out by a bottle of Cris
Followed by a kiss, I could take your lip gloss on my lips
So candy sweet, wit yo bubble gum tongue
The type of stuff that keep a brotha straight sprung
And I try to play tha tough guy roll
(Oh no no)
And hold back but I'm losin' control
(Gone crazy)
When it comes to you, I can't explain how I feel
(Talk)
No more games baby, Zane is for real
You've been askin' for quality time, now you got it
(Ohh)
(Ohh)
Anythin' you want you can have think about it
(Think about it)
I been caught up in tha hype so long
Now you never spend your nights alone
'Cuz daddy's home
Girl tonite I'm yours, ohh oh oh
I'm turnin' off my 2-way, turnin' off my phone
(Turnin' off my phone)
I'll tell my friends to leave
So we can be alone
(I wanna be alone)
Plan my schedule up 'cuz tonite I swear I'm all yours
(Tonite)

(Fellaz)
While you out on tha grind
Don't forget about your whole front
Spend some time wit your ladies
(Yeah)
Or the next man will
If you don't treat her like a queen
You gon' see what I mean
(I know that's right)
When the last time you told her how you felt inside
Held her hand and caressed her while you look'd in her eyes
(Yeah)
Let her know she's everythin' you need and want
For you my feelings are pure, tonight
Girl tonite I'm yours, ohh oh oh

And I didn't know how to solve them
Ohh baby but you were the answer
Now I'm givin' you all my time
