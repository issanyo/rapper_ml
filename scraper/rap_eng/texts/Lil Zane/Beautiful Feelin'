[Hook: repeat 4X]
Such a beautiful feeling

[Lil' Zane]
I know a lot of times, it seems like it gets hard
But you gotta always keep faith, and always look forward
You never know what the future might bring
You never know what's ahead

[Lil' Zane]
You got the attention of all the fellas so the chickens are jealous
They at your toes when it rains tryin to hold you umbrella
The new meat in town, all the niggas wonna get down
When getting no play they frown
You on they bad side, they callin you bitch now
Sophomore year, two years to go
All you tryin to do is get your first car, and make doe
Got a part time job, and the man callin your bluff
Always out to cheat us if you love wasn't enough
Problems in the home, daddy dearest done turned abusive
He got your moms scared, so thoughts are skippin out are useless
How can you get them grades, when you can't keep your focus
16 and getting hit this drunk nigga think he Joseph
Givin you black eyes so in school you wearin glasses
Friends ask what happin but believe behind your back they laughin
You show no worry but the pain don't hide
Baby girl wipe your eyes, Im here so don't cry
And it's

[Hook]

[Lil' Zane]
You turn no fire till you lies, tellin me I was safe
I can't take it no longer father open the gate
I seen all I can take, child killin's and rape
The same niggas that I used to love was showin' me hate
My harts lyrics and my spirits through you body and soul
Makin you feel the way I felt when these rhymes was wrote
My antidote a little weed smoke, time and thought
Makin me come up wit that raw shit, hurttin your hart
I know you feel me cause you know things I'm sayin is true
Now would I lie to you, about my life and what I been through
Tell me have you ever lost a best friend, to drugs and gats
Had to tell his mother knowin she would have an attack
Sorry lady but your son and I was runnin the block
Ran up in the wrong neighborhood, flossin our knots
Actin folish when we should have been home in the bed
Restin instead, Tony took two to the head
He never made it

[Hook]

[Lil' Zane]
I went hot summers and cold winters, wit no dinner and-a
Freezer full of ice ain't nothin' nice
And I never cream in my life, so when I did get it
I had to work and run wit it, have fun wit it
High speeds in 740's, niggas starin' hard
Mini battles and war stories, bitches love my scares
Sweatin' Kev' cause he paid, and plus he from the yard
No superstars, livin gods, is what we are
Town to town, dick em' down, that's how we do it baby
Under covers we wear rubbers cause catchin AIDS is crazy
I do the unbeliveable and talk the sweatest game
And see more dough than Snipes on the money train
Me bein' broke is the funniest joke
That's like a nigga tellin' me I stole a song he wrote
And I ain't tryin' to get caught up in all that madness, life is good
Young world follow me, lets get up out the hood

Chorus
