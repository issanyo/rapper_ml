(Unknown Man)
Them niggas wanna ride by do a lil' drive by
But they just dont know how
But we about to show 'em when the pistol backfire
And them niggas gone die
Them niggas wanna ride by do a lil' drive by
But they just dont know how
But we about to show 'em when the pistol backfire
And them niggas gone die
And we gone ride on 'em (ride on 'em)
And we gone ride on 'em (ride on 'em)
Uhhhhhhhhhh!!

[Lil' Zane]
Retaliation is a must when them niggas bout to bust slippin on us
Niggas kicked in the door took the yayo
Had a nigga on the floor all scared too
And they put the steel to my head too
I'm on the cellular
Wit my niggas "Where the hell are y'all"
Shit I'm about to go to jail and all
They didn't figga they was fuckin wit the wrong nigga wrong day
Doin shit in the wrong way
Nine holes couldn't hurt a nigga
Thats what they got
Now I'm screamin murder nigga
So shoot the block
Niggas gone bleed tonight
Plus I'm high on weed tonight
Muthafuckas won't breath tonight
World Wide renegades when I'm breedin right
You can see him on the news just seen the light
Glowin niggas y'all meet me
In College Park in the hour like that y'all be next

[Chorus]

[Lil' Zane]
Fast money done slowed up
Niggas cars got blowed up
Whole cities got tore up
And what you mean "Nigga hold up"
Shoulda seen this niggas eyes when my niggas roled up
And you can run but you can't hide
And I won't let shit slide
How many O's did you get right?
Do you know how many bullets bout to go up in your shit right?
Now

[Lil' Zane & Unknown]
Cituation gettin sticky
Why the fuck niggas pick me
Cause I'm rich see
Everybody out to get me
But the trick be
I'm about to pull a gypsy
Till the clips empty

[Lil' Zane]
And mufuckas gone respect the game
Look how I give it to them niggas real
And muthafucka why you try me
Why you think cause I'm under 21 I won't connect you to a I.V

[Chorus]

[Lil' Zane]
Oh you wanna be a bad ass nigga
Wanna be mad at us nigga
Fuck wit us nigga
Let the world know my niggas all I niggas
World Wide niggas
Pick 4-5, bury 4-5 niggas
Paralize 4-5 niggas
These muthafuckas ain't ready for the ride
I surprise niggas
I put the game from verse 2
(A tell 'em what the verse do)
Thug niggas get hurt too

[Lil' Zane & Unknown]
This shit gettin critical these niggas won't listen
These niggas bout to come up missen
These niggas see a young boy glistenin

[Lil' Zane]
Y'all niggas betta separate the hoes from G's
Fuck around and make me start wit these
Get in the car nigga gimme the keys
I'm bout to blast on 'em
Tell me if you wit me if you not get yo ass on

(Two guys havin conversation)

[1st guy]
"Nigga you know I'm down to bust these niggas
But tonight ain't the night to do that shit"

[2nd guy (Larenz Tate)]
"You actin like a lil' bitch right now
You actin real paranoid and shit
Now these muthafuckas smoked yo goddamn cousin
In front of you nigga
Blow his head off in front of yo face
And you gonna do shit?
You actin like a lil' bitch right now nigga
Man fuck that I ain't lettin that shit ride

[Chorus]
