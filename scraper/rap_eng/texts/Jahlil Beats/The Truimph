[Verse 1]
If your girl get to sipping, she gon' show out
Or call a nigga phone very time you leave and go out
You love your girl don't you?
Until I turn your hoe out
Fire bringing them hoes out then she fucking my whole house
Tuna on the line so a nigga reel them in
Bitches knocking on my door someone let them in
A young nigga, though my sex game a veteran
She was [?] until she started giving neck again
Rose gold Rollie bet they knowing them features
Shoes last name Scott, niggas knowing them sneakers
Move like I know it all, ain't a thing you can teach us
Me and my team like a secret, how your bitch wanna keep us?
Swag game proper, whip game proper too
Cocaine white flow, you can take a line or two
Niggas biting off my style anyway
Something on a Renegade though Jay is paving the way
They like "he rap hard, he bad lil nigga"
Y'all dudes is scrubs brillo pad lil niggas
I'ma always get mine, just time I'm guessing
Move smooth through the legend role, see I just checked in
I stay in the Range aiming making that 4 (pop pop)
Don't let me have you in your crib with them doors locked
Sending shots to your face, call it botox
I know that you don't want it like a Muslim with a pork chop
My nigga 'Lil gave me the beat and told me go in
Familiar, after this one niggas gon' know Jin
I do it with perfection why you getting disrespected
Studio, I'm in this bitch raw, call it unprotected
Keep fine women to brag with him, mobiles to shag in them
I fuck around and just might have Watty's Jag' missing
Listen that back seat will really have a [?]
Whips dirty, no carry, I be Washington
The action shit, he snapping better be careful with him
He dancing knowing that blammo with him, if he want his man will get him
Done told niggas before I be the one though
Breaking night, homie it's nothing I'm watching the sun show
They doubted thinking that I wouldn't blow though, no homo
Nigga my style picture perfect someone take a photo
I'll have your bitch pinned against the wall like she promo
In case you didn't know so, SQ be the logo bitch
