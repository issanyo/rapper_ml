[Verse 1: J Doe]
Okay, I make them hoes stop, they staring when they see me
And my space ship rolled up, they glare off that bitch be shinin,so damn hard
They compare it to a motherfucker
To the north star, speaking of star
Baby when you see me make a wish, I be shippin burbon
Bitches try to blow a kiss, I walked up in the club
And I ain’t on the fucking list
DJ see me and they be like “J-Doe in this bitch”
Then the club turn up
Get my kick game mean, I be rocking everything that you ain't never seen
I ain’t got a scuff on me
Boy you know I’m clean, they said that they had ‘em
But it’s only in the dream, wake up motherfucker
I’m a boss in reality, thick bitch with me
‘Bout to help her burn some callories, ride in that Gucci plea
She grabbin’ my anathomy, I casualty throwed that back
Rover and you know it was over… oh yeah…

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I said I make them hoes stop and stare, when I rock this Audemar
I pull up in the Lamborghini, tap the gas and disappear
I talk shit like Ricky Flaire, you talk shit not backin’ up
My goons come from my crazy house and all I do is strap’em up
Appointed you, they clap you up and we dip like tortilla do
Lookin’ at my neck and wrist I think that cost a key or two
I done fucked Shamika, Keisha, Stacey had Kia too
Ronnie and Juwanna too, Alana down to Gina too
I’m in the zone like 3 on 2, my flo be on supersport
My money Shaquille tall, you paper be super short
In the Panamera, they don’t know this is Coup for sure
All the fuckin’ ballin’ bitches thinking that I hoop for sure
Swish, kept me rollin’, I be prolly with your bitch
If you know me, I be prolly in the mix
Like Cheese doodles, Pretzels and some Chips
I’m gone! Swag! Hah!

[Verse 3: J Doe]
Uh, now I control the streets no remote
And you see me gettin’ more blessed since them Tebow
The women hit me up everyday the same queue
My Facebook friend request it’s going through the roof
And I’m just tryna keep up
I’m firestein, never been second
My swag so sharp I can use it as a weapon
Baby you to fine right here, come meet somebody better
You know that time is money and he can’t buy you a second
Meanwhile my bank account is climbing
Now it’s landing on an island
Got a hundred thousand problems and cup with sharpest bottom
And my sweeter happened to meet up on the beach
She whispered in my hear her heart goes for streets
She said she like my belt wich’s matchin’ with my shirt
Wich’s matchin’ with my shoes so she decided to flirt
My style got her higher than the somking on the purp
Now in it with a shift enough to liften up her skirt
You know I make ‘em…
