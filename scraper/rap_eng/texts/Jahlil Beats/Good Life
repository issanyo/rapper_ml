[Intro: Lore'l]
Hmm, sike, hahaha

[Verse 1: Lore'l]
I lay up for (?) top notch momma
Bitches full of stories like a day time drama
I (?) quote; Corinthians, thousand dollar garments
And expensive condominiums
Fly, ain't shit plain, first class then champagne
1 shot for Kurt Cobain to the head, fame hungry hoes
Sharing that mic, ain't no way (?)
When I cover that role, taking that power like Rogue
My ex man, screaming front row at my shows
Isn't it ironic? Now, I'm iconic but, I can't kick chronic
Crazy, I don't know none of my limits til' I vomit
Talk a gang of shit but I still pay homage
I love those nappy headed hoes; Don Imus
Already the finest, now, I need to see a wine list

[Chorus: Lore'l]
Living the good life, fuck does the good look like?
Right where I belong, I belong in the spotlight
Living the good life, living the good life
The things I'm doing wrong, can't be wrong cuz it feel right
Living the good life, fuck does it look like?
Right where I belong, I belong in the spotlight
Living the good life, living the good life
The things I'm doing wrong, can't be wrong cuz it feel right

[Verse 2: Lore'l]
Soon as I heard that bitches wanna imitate, play Emmet Till
Don't lay with snakes. Well off (?) Kathy Bates
Bergdorf shop, saving hoes without a cape
Drake, you can thank me later, but, I'm loving all the hate
Tyler, The Creator, when I speak, I defecate
And, somehow I'm killing it, ya'll bitches ain't
Custom closet; welcome to the pearly gates
Calling me the prophet, bitch, I motivate
Reaching in his pockets, money masturbates
(?) Jimmy Choo's don't lie
Plus, I'm too high to remember an alibi; not guilty
Fucking mouth filthy, to mess with my man
Bitch, you gotta kill me
To all my fans, that's vibing with the real me
Please don't call me Monica when I run with Hilary's

[Chorus: Lore'l]
Living the good life, fuck does the good look like?
Right where I belong, I belong in the spotlight
Living the good life, living the good life
The things I'm doing wrong, can't be wrong cuz it feel right
Living the good life, fuck does it look like?
Right where I belong, I belong in the spotlight
Living the good life, living the good life
The things I'm doing wrong, can't be wrong cuz it feel right
