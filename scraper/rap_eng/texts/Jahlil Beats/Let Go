[Intro]
Awwwh (Awwwh)

It's Cliff Sav-do-the-maverick
(awh-awwh)
(Jahil Beats, holla at me!)
Awh

[Hook]
She been through 99 niggas
And she still ain't found a real one (awh)
I guess it only leaves me
Mama told me that these bitches heartless
They don't even feel none (awh)
So i don't need em' on the team
Let go (4x)
Fuck 'em
(don't need 'em on the team)
Let go (4x)
So i don't need em' on the team (ey)
Let go

[Verse 1]
Ok that rollie on my wrist
It makes me give a fuck about a bitch (awh)
Always in my face and yappin' man
She's always talking shit
Damn (damn?), you know who i am? (am?)
The only SAVAGE nigga in the building throwing hands
Never scared to throw em up (throw em up?), throw 'em up (throw em up)
And i ain't gotta flex cause your girl know wassup (wassup)
Wait, here she goes with that again
Sort of like a scratch and win
Never know what you're gon' get
From Instagram and snap and shit
Awh (awh), awwwh (awwwh)
Baby really could'a had it all (all)
She been through 99 niggas, 99 niggas
And how the fuck have you ain't found a winner, how you figure?
Pullin' triggas in the pussy 'til I shoot it out of sight
Cause i don't want it in my hizzie, really am i right?
Look, It's been a minute, it's been a minute (awwh)
And i don't need attention, i've been hiding in the kitchen

[Hook]
She been through 99 niggas
And she still ain't found a real one (awh)
I guess it only leaves me
Mama told me that these bitches heartless
They don't even feel none (awh)
So i don't need em' on the team
Let go (4x)
Fuck 'em
(don't need 'em on the team)
Let go (4x)
So i don't need em' on the team (ey)
Let go

[Verse 2]
I let her kick it like homie
Now i feel like she don't know me (what?)
And they used to tell
She was good for nothing fake or phony
I, couldn't (i?) believe man
They couldn't tell me nothing
Even though i see the signs
Got dammit i was blind
Look (look), Never trust a bitch
As far as you could throw her
They're in every city racing
For you niggas like a motor
O'boy! What they really want
Tell me what they really want
All these bitches heartless
And it's hard for us to get along
Awh (awh), awwwh (awwwh)
Baby really could'a had it all (all)
Imma fuck up all your feelings cause it's fuck just how you're feeling
Either way i'm getting paper, 'bout to stack it to the ceiling
I'm a westside nigga (side?) from an eastside city (side?)
Learning every little way these women operate it with me
Look
I don't do hoes (hoes)
I just let go (go)
And if that's a problem
I don't care to know

[Hook]
She been through 99 niggas
And she still ain't found a real one (awh)
I guess it only leaves me
Mama told me that these bitches heartless
They don't even feel none (awh)
So i don't need em' on the team
Let go (4x)
Fuck 'em
(don't need 'em on the team)
Let go (4x)
So i don't need em' on the team (ey)
Let go

[Outro]
Never say i never told you niggas (say i never told you niggas) (2x)
Let go (let go) (2x)
(awh-awh-awwwwh)
You're holding on to something
That you're probably gon' regret, don't (don't, don't, ...)
Don't say i never told you niggas (don't say i never told you niggas)
Never say i never told you niggas (don't say i never told you niggas)
Let go
(awh-awh-awwwwh)
