I'm back with another gem. I'm making crystals with my Chizzile pen. Call it a missile pen. Words explode off pages like Russell (Russell Westbrook)  at the other end. I'm onna fast break. I break my fast by devouring rappers like rock off the glass. I'm feasting off the hunger. Sharp bullet words pelton their blubber. Leave em with skid marks. Yeah i burnt em like rubber. I cross legend Minds like I hit em with the stutter. Get the pictures. it's a still shutter. I'm about to have every whack mcee under. Under the globe. Tied up with ropes. I'm in my vial mode. I'm in my berserk stage. They can catch this fade like dirk's fade. It's kicken. I'm shitten on em like a fucken pigion. I'm not at my highest peak yet. You ain't seen the real beast unleash yet. I devour rappers like a fucken pack of huskies. Make em feel loose like they rocken husky. Their bars light weight. They live bait. Itll never be their turn to take. Like they always ride straight. I stay boosten up like the crime rate. This the intro of the mix. You seeing a rising star's potential. Kp6 on the knicks
