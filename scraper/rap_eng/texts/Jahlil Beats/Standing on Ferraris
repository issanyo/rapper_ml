[Intro: The Game & Diddy]
I put that on Piru
Yo Game, let's go

[Chorus: Game]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead, walked through every hood in LA
Bandana on my head, guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out, bitches with their knockers out
I done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
In a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti
That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Verse 1: Game & Diddy]
Ran the west for a decade nigga, check the bio
Gave you Cincinnati fitteds like I get it in Ohio
Autographs on the vinyl made the Lamb albino
Straight away in the Wraith, that's a Peyton Manning spiral
You lookin' at your idol, Jesus wrote the Bible
Yeezus, that's my Nike town rival
Dare a nigga try me now, like why me now
Lookin' for Red Octobers, I will tie him down
Stay laced, spit nothin' but based, yeah
All my shit bump like Craig Mack face
Ask your favorite bitch how my dick taste (Baaaaaaaaddd Boyyyyyy)
Ask your neighbor's bitch how my dick taste
Don't take orders, I dictate, get your shit straight
Dickface, perpetual Rollies with the big face
I got 'em lovin' the movement
Beard so long, I'm feelin' like Rick Rubin

[Chorus: Game]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead, walked through every hood in LA
Bandana on my head, guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out, bitches with their knockers out
I done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
In a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti
That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Verse 2: Game]
Top floor at the Biltmore, say they want a
War, shit, that's what I'm built for, loungin'
Miami with the eye candy
Bitches names Sandy and Bambi, my exes can't stand me
God blessed the nigga with more swag than Jigga
More hoes than Trigga, Trigga know, that's my nigga though
Figure four down, Figueroa, Ric Flair
Phantom, all red flannel, niggas don't hit me though
Spit on models, R.Kelly, piss on the center fold
Ever since Doc showed me a billion in a envelope
Love Jimmy, fuck Interscope, I'm a don
Walk outside, naked, Cuban cigar and Louboutins, huh
Shit on my lawn, snakes in the grass
I hear 'em slitherin' and hissin' whenever I pass
Ridin' 'round in somethin' French; Khloe Kardash'
Two-hundred on the dash, that's your ass

[Chorus: Game]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead, walked through every hood in LA
Bandana on my head, guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out, bitches with their knockers out
I done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
In a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti
That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Outro: Diddy]
Yo, this nigga Game bought me a motherfuckin' red Ferrari for my birthday, nigga. (I put that on Piru) Told me I was honorary. (Put that on Piru)
I said, nigga, I'm with whatever with this motherfuckin' red Ferrari, nigga. Yeah, I'll take it
Nigga, Game givin' out red Ferraris for no reason, it was just a Tuesday
A motherfuckin' Tuesday. Niggas said happy Tuesday, Puff
Now that nigga wanna stand on my Ferrari every day
Now that nigga wanna stand on my motherfuckin' Ferrari all the time
Drivin' down the street with Hype Williams shootin' a video. We ain't even shootin' a video, we just motherfuckin' ridin' down the street, this nigga got Hype Williams shootin' and shit
See this what happens when that East meets West, we get together, know what I'm sayin'? Say fuck the rest, we start partyin' and bullshittin', havin' a good time, throwin' pool parties and shit
Niggas start buyin' niggas from the East Coast Ferraris and shit, shit all good, red Ferraris at that, nigga
Shit, ain't got no time for no other shit, I just got time to get this motherfuckin' money man. Get this money with me man. So that's what we decided to do so now we gettin' more money than anybody and everybody
And the only color that we motherfuckin' at the end of the day gonna beef over is that motherfuckin' green motherfucker
