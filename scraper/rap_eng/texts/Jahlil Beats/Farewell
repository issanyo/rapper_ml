(Intro)

Verse:

No more missing leg day
Im still stuck in my ways
Chillin, eating garlic chicken mac n cheese on the plate
See all it took was a taste
I feel in love wit that cake
Took a L wit Lisa
Since then I ain't made no mistakes
I count it twice to be safe
I keep an eye on the snakes
Jealousy is just the start
But you know love turn to hate
Got august out in LA
I pack my bag
And she ain't never seen me back in her place
I kept it cool
But this liquor got me staying wit you
Reminiscing bout some bitches that got ran by the crew
Sad to see y'all lose, but my business got benefits too
Caribbean let's take a cruise and dip our feet in the pool
Diamond rings, gold-links, and still no scuffs on the shoes
Paying close attentions to the niggas here for the view
Drop that StANCE tape and critics waiting patient for too
Columbus if your listening I'll pay respect when I'm through
Farewell

The old me couldn't handle what we been handed
I'm number one in the standings
I'm staying close to the family
Give my thanks to aunt Brandi
For all times I was over
Cozyboy on YouTube wit the fresh cut on the sofa
We chilling smoking at hover, wit Taylor, Taylor and Madi
Boxing uncle's Caddy
Have the innocences getting nasty
That's life
Learn quick
Or you'll be losing your light
That's life.boy
Say it twice
For those who won't wake up tonite
Farewell

To all that bullshit
And boy you ain't got it
I'm that same 5'3 nigga picking your pockets
Got them fresh print bills nigga deep in my wallet
I'm honest
Why would I lie about my name
And how I got it
I promise
You'll be astonished
To learn about how i got it
Im, on a misson who the fuck gon come in and stop it
On them sidelines, I realized that i was done watching
For my dawgs
Ima make sure we got it
Ya heard…
Forreal

I really shouldn't speak on this topic
If it's not real hip hop
Then you not poppin

When we talk they move
See every move that's made I choose
Pick your posion
Death by me or sent to the crew
Farewell

It's far from over, got angels all on my shoulders
Ha respect OvO but this is my october
Everytime I wear my fit, I gain exposure
I’m the owner
You can thank me later baby, but right now I’m taking over
Know the name
Farewell
