Intro:

Hala at me too!
This nigga ain't hala'ring at me..

EMM
Verse 1:

Ladies and gentlemen
Rookies and veterans
K9, Nicko and Emm
We killing all of dem
Done with the target practice, and now we making hits
Get your toilet paper, we droppin real ish
My home is the zoo - animal instincts
Fresh from the underground, you'd swear I was buried alive
They said I couldn't cut it, so I brought a knife
I’m a fuckin outlaw, I'm always dressed to kill
I hold cyphers in I.C.U. yeah, I'm really ill
I never liked fairytale because I keep it real
Uhamba inyanga, beat a King Of Pop
You trying to beat Michael Jackson with yo moon walk
I polished my speech with wax now I got smooth talk
We beating up drums, we making street bangers
Shock Therapy, flows come with signs of danger
I don’t like house music, I’m down with Squatter Camp
But I can hang with them, I be burning shacks
Screw yo Metro train, I just stay on track

Nicko
Verse 2:

Pass the mic nigga
Yeah, nazi ingozi
It's Nicko baby

Before I go any further
I juss wana send a shout out to the niggas that I've always shitted em
Like they're my toilets
Niggas dissing me is like a Sim saying nothing
So.. Silence
Life is a wound, depends what you gave birth to
And you got a miscarriage
I'm going hard like a rural village
I juss said the same thing twice
And I bet you didn't hear it
You stupid, you dumb!
Niggas making noise like imoto efayo
You just lame, niggas are sick I'm healthy as fuck
Boy ngi za khataza
I don't know whatchu holdin against me coz you so out of stock
My rhymes are like an Afrikaaner nigga holding a sjambok
Shock Therapy, call it SWAT team
I'm not calm like the water in the lake
You can't hold me a traffic yasebree

Yeah ingozi!

K9
Verse 3:

(Nicko): Is it god?

Oh no son, it's K9
Shit I'm so dope son, I steal my own rap lines
Kill a verse like Oscar, if this beat is valentine
Gimme boxing gloves if you straight - punchline
Busy fuckin 6 hoes like I'm with 2 santas (Ho Ho Ho)
Nigga test me, I swear death will be the answers
I break virginities like a kid breaking pencils
Start an anus company, work yo fucken ass off
Don't hate, coz I front on niggas when I back off
I don't give a shit but my pockets full of assholes
A frog wrote an essay, it jumped into conclusions
My flow is so sick, doctors come up with excuses
My swag is just dumb but you can never fool me
I sleep on twitter nigga, I follow my dreams
Im always wearing jeans coz rap is in my genes
Calender wid no eyes, call that a blind date
Flow is fresh, wrote my lines with fucken colgate
I got more bars than a motherfucken bar graph
I'm hard to get like an afrikaans paragraph
Guess where I found my ex?? In my maths book
K9 you always number 1, well you two
This track if full of punches, like a Mike fight
You track ain't got punches, like a gay fight
Nicko pass the mic to me, like he studied last night
