[Verse]
Yo
They Say That They Real But All Of Em Fake
I Got A Body In The Trunk Just Find Me A Lake
Niggas Lying Bout They Status and Money They Make
When We Lookin' For The Static Ain't None Of Em Safe
We Be Gettin' Money No Time For The Talkin'
I Just Copped Me A Five Seven I'm Ready To Spark It
Thought You Could Run Off On The Plug Now You Dead In A Coffin
I'm Puttin' Numbers On The Board Like I'm Magic In Boston
I Just Want The Pussy Don't Tell Me Ya Problems
He Got A Problem with The Crew and I'm Ready To Solve Em
This Nigga Food We Pullin' Up and We Ready To Park Em
Listen Duke I'm Chasin' Bucks Like My Last Name Is Parker
You Don't Eat If You Ain't Struggle with Us
Shorty Give Me Throat, You Niggas Cuddle with Her
When They Free My Nigga Lil He Gonna Come and Get Ya
Hit You and Any Nigga Saying They Runnin' with Ya
We Strapped with .44s and Better
Mansa Say Get Em Told Him I Got Em Just Grab The Chedda
Pops Gave Me The Game I Covered It Like A Sweater
My White Boy He A Shooter He’ll Pop You Like J.J Reddick
Nigga You Ain’t Safe In Ya Own Hood
They Think The God Broke But We All Good
I Would Wanna Be Me Too If We All Could Cuz I Got The Juice Like I’m Q Back In Nine Two
When It’s War Time We Come and Find You
Music Low Dark Tint When We Slide Through
Papi Said We Get It Cheaper If We Buy Two
Copped That Pushed The Work Out The Drive Through
Top Back On The Jeep Gotta Climb Through
All My Niggas Got The Heat Like LeBron Do
Bring The Apes To The Streets Like The Bronx Zoo
I Got It Made If You Creep I'll Divide You

[Hook]
Blowin' Money Fast, Blowin' Money Fast
I Just Want My Money In A Brown Bag
My Son Gave Him Three Like He Steve Nash
Throwin' Shade On The God I Just Breeze Pass
Fuck Being Humble, Fuck Being Humble
We Gone Shoot It Out I Don’t Wanna Rumble
Now I Got The Rock I Won't Never Stumble
Fuck Being Humble, Fuck Being Humble
