[Verse 1]
Yo, sometimes you gotta slow your roll
And keep your mind up on the goal
That's what [?] told
Even at times when its you and you feel all alone
Just know that you gonna live out another story told
So that's why you gotta keep it going, keep it strong
Live in a poem, that I wrote a long time ago
When I was in [?]
Smoked my first blunts on the project roof, its rough
Moms leaving the cribs, Pops get locked up
Feeling like there's nowhere to go
They sell crack just to make it on this rocky road
And I get it off the raps that's a blessing, yo
Big brother and [?] got me stressing no
But Ima keep going hard we came from the roads
Itching for dollars, and an Impala
Now I'm in the hills with the models
These rappers are sick, they saying what I spit is the cure
And I ain't gon' stop that's one thing for sure

[Chorus]
I been zoning, I been dreaming
I been smoking, I been leaning
And I'm wide awake, while they sleeping
And I live everyday like it's the weekend
And we stay fly, like the weekend
And we get high, like the weekend
And I'm wide awake, while they sleeping
And I live everyday like it's the weekend

[Verse 2]
Living like the weekend, in the water know we swimming in the deep end
Out in California keep the trees lit
I ain't waking up I think that Ima sleep in
Waking up at dawn sleeping in the morn
In my vision my chick in that [?]
To find a [?] and spend it all at the mall
If you answer all my money you can get a call
I don't give a fuck Ima ride in my coup
Doors lifting up suicide in my coup
Two-hundred on the dash Ima fly in my coup
I got the gas and police I dodge in my coup
[?] on my radar, fuck around and Ima have to hit em with my AR
Like pigeons I be way up
That's probably why they can't see me like I'm Ray Charles
Nigga this a lifestyle
Fuck that talking 'bout it, Ima get it right now
Tell that ho to pipe down, trying fucking tell that ho leave right now
You know that I'm 'bout that
You say you trying smoke but where your house at (x2)
Cause it's the weekend...

[Chorus]
