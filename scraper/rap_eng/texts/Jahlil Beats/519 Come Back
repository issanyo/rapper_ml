[Hook: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
I recall back when daddy hid the J
Back when cokeboy use to paint the place
Had a humble heart, headed on my way
Grew up next to bars & I was only 8!

[Verse 1: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
Now I’m 18 & I got shit to say
Slick talk a lot, that’s the way the haters play
Remember when I gave a fuck what a hater say
Kept a mental note, everday is hater day
I would pray the mixtape would keep the hate away
Big mistake aye it’s finna bring a hate array
Observate the hate display of the hater spray
Reinstate the hater rate, feed em hater bate

[Chorus: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
MapleLeaf Bound, that’s a mission eh?
South ON, that’s where my city stay
Real Windsorites, to the starting gate
Bout to come up from my city in a major way

[Verse: 2]
Now I'm 17 I got shit to say
Switching other ways switching to the other lane
Done today, all we do is work n play
Rapping everday n so the haters hate

Isn't fuckin optional
Yo homie
Tell me what's possible
Really be n team be flawsin do
Fleet from the scene gettin green she gotta go-she gotta go

On steps and now she knockn doe
Never know what she told but she wan sum moore
Stepping mean with team-dream bout to blow
Mystery history what we haven't told

N we goin fo the fuckin gold
N we got it n own it like it fuckin sold
Dosnt even really mater who we fucking told
Hear this shit, words are clear n its fucking bold

Ball hard n they crying
Hear the siren
When n I'm flyin-assume donn get smacked
Go fix that
Your slack
519 comeback

[Verse 3: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
Then I come back!
That’s you girl?
Damn, have her bum back
I done run that
Had her stay the day
Felt some typa way
Couldn’t keep a stray
Tell’er fall back

[Chorus: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
MapleLeaf Bound, that’s a mission eh?
South ON, that’s where my city stay
Real Windsorites, to the starting gate
Bout to come up from my city in a different way

[Verse 4:]
Different way
Haters always got shit to say
Been told all we do is work n play
Keep it flowin like we pasing every single day
RTK stepping hard eh this is cray
