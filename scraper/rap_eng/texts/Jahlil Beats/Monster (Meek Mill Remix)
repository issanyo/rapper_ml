[Hook]
The money turned me into a monster
Muhammad Ali if I’m a boxer
The money turned me into a monster
Got me balling out like I’m on the Spurs roster

[Verse]
Pockets full of hundreds so I alter the weather
She say she wouldn't do it but now she'll fuck with us
Ay stop it you are gone you don't drink enough
Can can I have some more twist it just like Oliver
All the rhymes I tote so you know that I’m the GOAT
On a boat they wanna drown me but I stay afloat
Walk in shut her down, bitch the building’s foreclosed
Give her four strokes that’s a sore throat
I swear I love rap, yep that’s my main girl
They want a handout, but my hands full
I like to push my luck, cuh cuz I can’t fall
And I’m taking hella hits just like baseball
You people talking shit well there’s the bathroom
Fuck boys taking notes like this my classroom
Take the air out of em just like a vacuum
Take off on the airplane straight to Cancun, whoa

[Hook]
The money turned me into a monster
Muhammad Ali if I’m a boxer
The money turned me into a monster
Got me balling out like I’m on the Spurs roster

[Outro]
Stuck here praying for better days
Sucks being here paying Sallie Mae
But one day I'll cop the fucking escalade
Escalate myself to a better place
