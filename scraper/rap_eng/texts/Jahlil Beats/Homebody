24/7, every single day
Do the same shit but it's just a different day (x3)

Do the same shit but it's just a different--

[Sevon Miles]
I'm just a young kat from the LV, NV
Humble is apart of me, got no time to envy
I know how it feels not to get invites
To come kick it with your crew and mess around all night
People say I get girls when it's not even true
If it was, I wouldn't get home until 2
All I do is be on my laptop and browse
Catch up on my shows and watch porn sometimes
Cell phone silent unless it's notifications
Stuck at home while the homies on vacation
If I don't communicate then I won't get communication
I guess that's what you call love on a separation
Watch the Wayans Bros. on MTV
And watch the Food Network, that's just how it be
Very simple, very down to earth
I'm specially made to exemplify my worth
