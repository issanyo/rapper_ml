[Hook]
See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool

And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it

[Verse 1]
See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Cause every time she try to tell me something, she open up her mouth, I stick my tongue in
She got a piercing in her vagina, a skirt with nothing under
And she say when she don't see me, she feels like Stevie Wonder

[Pre-Hook]
That's when I said, "Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt"
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind

[Bridge]
Uh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip when she like that dick
Ooh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip don't fight that dick girl, girl
Fucking with you, well, I'ma need another shower
I'ma need another shower
Can you help me take another shower?
Then we gonna make each other shout

[Verse 2]
There's steam in the air, fog everywhere
She can get her hair wet cause it's her real hair
I be like, "Hell Yeah"
And she be like, "Fucking right"
Now she got one leg in the air, I'm pulling on her hair
And she say I can pull it, cause it's her real hair
She be like, "Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah" cause I fuck her right

[Pre-Hook]
That's when I said, "Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt"
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind

[Outro]
Then I said, "See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
