[Hook: B.A.D.]
Now you can follow me, where we go, we will see / or you can ha-T-E, ain’t nothing new to me (Repeat)

[Verse 1: B.A.D.]
Motherfuckers keep telling me they spit the dopest lines
Say they discovered the secret of the dopest rhymes
They spit that shit not only double-time but triple-time
Slow down, youngster, one step at a time
First listen to your shit, then listen to mine
See you’re a pest plant, I’m a Great Basin bristlecone pine
I live, you’re dying
Your shit: fast forward, my shit: rewind
I’m dope, you’re trying
I’m Homer J., you: Frank Grimes
The way I see it there is nothing you can do
No need to give any more proof, I’m through
You didn’t really believe you could gain a foothold in this game, now did you
I think it’s time for you to man up and face the truth
So here’s some piece of advice, kid: stay in school
Cos whoever told you your shit’s dope, it’s not true
Wanna know how to spit, it’s nothing I can teach you but show you
Ears, speakers, this right here’s the glue
There you go, fool!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.A.D.]
See I’m just killing this shit right now
Told ya, wanna know how to spit, I will show you how
I rip this shit when I spit so sick
Watch out for that dynamite stick, the match is lit
Got y’all craving for my shit like a bitch for the dick
This beat’s the pussy, I’m the prick
Watch me slide it in and it fits-- perfect
I was built for this, period
You skeptics really starting to get on my nerves and shit
Acting like a bitch that’s on her period

But from this point on there is nothing you can do or say
This shit explodes in front of you like a fucking grenade
You’re asking for truce but for that it’s clearly too late
There can only be one, only he who dominates
I said from this point on there is nothing you can do or say
This shit explodes in front of you like a fucking grenade
You’re asking for truce but for that it’s clearly too late
There can only be one, only he who dominates

[Hook]
