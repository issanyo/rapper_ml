[VERSE 1. Patick Baitman]

ON PIECES OF PRISON PAPER
I PEN PARAGRAPHS OF SIN
EPILOGUES FOR ALL THESE RAPPERS
CLAIMING THEIR KING
LETS SEE IF THEY SAY THE SAME THING
ONCE I JUMP IN THE RING
ITS REGOCIDE
WHEN I BUMP INTO KINGS
I'VE BEEN MAKING GUMS NUMB
SINCE I WAS YOUNG
NOW IM IN ZAIRE
BIG KHIA BLUNT
MY EMPIRE
THE ENTIRE GAME
SPIT FIRE FLAME
LIKE DHALSIM
I'LL NEVER THROW THE TOWEL IN
IM SHAOLIN PEDIGREE
MONGRELS! I'M EITHER MAO OR KENNEDY
DEPENDS WHO YA ASK THOUGH
USED TO BE IN  ENDS WITH THE CARGO
ALWAYS IN MY SOCK, CAH I'D RATHER GO PEN
DEN PUT PENG IN MY ARSEHOLE
NOW I JUST CHILL WATCH SOME FARGO
Either  THAT OR IM READIN
OR IM SIPPIN
DOM WITH MY BREDDERS
WHILE  CONNOR MCGREGORS
SHOW DESE  MAN ABOUT FIGHTING IRISH
LIKE OSIRUS
I SUN GODS
THAT MEANS I BATTLE ANYONE
AT JUMP OFF
MIGHT SOUND OBNOXIOS
I COULD TALK AT OXFORD
LIKE MALIK SHABAZZ
IM DEEP AS NAS
OR VENEZELUAN OIL
THIS YEAR IM TRYNA
TAKE MY CHICK TO JAMAICAN SOIL
BAIL OUT MY CO-D
COME BACK A RASTA
LIKE ALBOROSIE
FOUL AS GOAT MEAT
LEFT OUT IN THE SUN FOR DAYS
USED TO BE STRESSED OUT
SOME MY  DAYS
WENT WITHOUT EATING GOT JUMPED
FOR  DAYS
COULDN'T PISS WITHOUT BLEEDIN
BACK DEN
WANTED TO TALK TO BIG WITHOUT MEDIUMS
ANSMER ME THIS
WHATS   BRUCE LEE'S FIST WITHOUT DEMONS
PULLING IT BACK
MY BARS LIKE BULLETS TO STRAPS
PUSSY IM BACK
