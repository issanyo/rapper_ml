[Intro]
When I'm on, it’s on bitch
When I'm on, it’s on bitch
When I'm on, it’s on bitch
When I'm on, it’s on

[Verse 1]
First off, y'all ain't on this shit that I'm on, eyes like I was made in Taiwan
Aces you could say what you want, just blow me, I'm a ticking time bomb, boom
Might pull up in the car show, niggas ain't gotta gas me like Arco
Riding through the city with a hood full of Broncos, out just looking for the money like Waldo
I just wanna ball, Rondo, make it rain in this bitch, get a poncho
Roll up blunt thicker than a hollow, take one hit, might turn into a combo
Got one eye open like a raider, better cuff your chick, I take her
Say I gotta tongue like skater shoes and lay the pipe like 80 do

[Chorus]
Y'all ain't on this shit that I'm on
Ya-Y'all ain't on this shit that I'm on
Y'all ain't on this shit that I'm on
Ya-Y'all ain't on this shit that I'm on

[Verse 2]
Okay, money on my mind, put it in my hair, eyes look like I was made in Japan
Fresh, y'all niggas was made in a can, so fly, you should see when I land
Movie in the making, hi my name is, 2 in the air, call it double dating
Jahlil on the beat, I'm a troublemaker, going through paper, staplers
One foot in tatted like a sailor, trying to find a bad bitch, Naughty by Nature
Sorry baby, these ain't out yet, gotta go back to the future for my outfit
Bitch I'm gone, see me from a distance, high off life, fuck a intervention
Ah, burn slow like incense, head up, chest out like imprints

[Chorus] + [Intro]
