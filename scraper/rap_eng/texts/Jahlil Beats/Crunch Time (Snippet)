{SoLost_- Hook x2}
Rhymes Sound Like I was Born In 87
Am Running With Myself
Am My Only Competition
Armstrong When It Come To Heart
Live Free, Die Hard
I Been Doing This From The Fucking Start

{SoLost_ Verse 1}
Niggas catchin feelings like they seat fillers
Duane Martin
Damn Gina!!!
Get out Pam
Role Models
Lamar, Cole
J Hov
Words That
Wrap Around
Virgin ears
And squeeze skulls
And take control like an auto pilot
Take Off
They sent you off
Leader Of What?
You must be nuts or missing some
First Class, Missed it
No Class, You ain't Shit
Imma Master, PGA
Yall relaxed
Flaccid
Like a penis, yall ain't seen shit
Cover up
Eskimo Titties
Am Rocky Balbo, BIG, Sean in my city
And I ain't even got a CD
But am but am back on offense
Your bars are subtle
They don't hit hard
Kinda reminds me of a virgin
They Worthless
I just speak the truth on nerd shit
