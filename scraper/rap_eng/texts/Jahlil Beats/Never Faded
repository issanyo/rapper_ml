Verse 1:
Okay I'm still the one that be callin'
So know that if they on it
It's reason to believe that they be knowin' where we bought it
Say I opened up the talkin'
Like I opened up my Jordan's
Everyone is 1 of 1 and they promote it through the corner
Let it be what it should be
Catchin' me is catchin' leaps
Say the trunk is off the sub
Shit is screamin out the Jeep
All they wanted was the real
Ain't no leavin' out a scene
If we decorate this table tell em' we'll be out they reach
Shit is deck of cards spaded
This will get you cross faded
And the line is Smooth Mag shit you better off waitin'
All of this is what it is and if they ever wanna weigh in
Let em' know that this is us and it was never for the taking

We deserve it
Tell em' we deserve it
Cover us in stripes
Fuckin' right we worth it
All of them is flirtin'
All of them is perfect
So draw string whatever baby all of them is curtains
And me

Hook:
I'm never faded
Never faded
Never faded
I swear I'm never faded
We say that how we want it
And that be how we play it
We say it how we want it
And that be how we made it how we made it
Never faded over here
Never faded over here
Never faded over here
Never faded yep

We ain't never faded over here
Never faded over here
Never faded over here
Never faded over here
Never faded yo
Never been

Verse 2:
Okay
Super poppin'
Word to Jahlil Beats
If shorty truly poppin' I hope that them pills speak
And yea I do be watchin' so know if I'm near the V
She probably right behind and hoping for clearer reach
Reachin' for your dreamin' baby you don't gotta dare sleep
I be other sidin' it
Get to know the opposite
Get to know the reason why they G'n when we droppin' in
Adjustin' to fame see I'm straight off of the block wit it
Charms on
Lean straight
Aroma is Y'ves Saint
Word spreadin' back and forth around like they seen Jakes
Bucket low
Fuck it though
I'm lookin' to touch and go
They lookin' for me to bring it up a note

So tell em' we deserve it
Tell em' we deserve it
Cover us in stripes
Fuckin' right we worth it
All of them is flirtin'
All of them is perfect
So draw string whatever baby all of them is curtains
And me
