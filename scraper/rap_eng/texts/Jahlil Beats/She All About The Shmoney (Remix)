[Intro]
Girl, he got shmoney

[Hook: Rowdy Rebel]
She all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas
She don't with broke niggas, she don't fuck with broke niggas
She all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas
She don't with broke niggas, she don't fuck with broke niggas

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
Lil bitch, go and shake that ass for these tips
Come bring it back and do a split on this dick
For a couple bands, she'll shmoney dance on this dick
Pussy so good, I went to France with the bitch
Damn, she look good when she back that ass up
Damn, I look good when I stack the cash up
I'mma lay a lil nigga now, don't forget it now
Pussy nigga good, boy, you know I tear it down
Broke niggas talking but I can't hear 'em now
Pussy niggas play, boy, you know I sit 'em down
Fool nigga play with me, I make his brains hit the floors
Smoke some good weed with my bitch and watch hit the floor
I done roll through the door, make some bands with the bitch
Like you never see me walk in holdin' hands with the bitch
I'mma lay a lil nigga, don't fuck with broke niggas
And she all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas

[Hook: Rowdy Rebel]
She all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas
She don't with broke niggas, she don't fuck with broke niggas
She all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas
She don't with broke niggas, she don't fuck with broke niggas

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Walk up in this bitch throwing C-notes
With some G Code, got her in the back yelling "East coast"
Little bit of Henny with some weed smoke
And some Clicquot , told my freak ho "Keep my drink, ho"
She gon' pop that pussy for the week though
Every weekend, tell her I need some pussy and some deep throat
She gon' do that thing until her knees broke
On the d-low, baby ran through like 3 bros
Paulie told my nigga go in beast mode, I'm in beast mode
Shooting niggas for the cheap, ho
Nigga only owed the nigga 30, yeah 30
Then I shot him with the eagle
Cause a nigga got a big ego, I’m illegal, bustin’ shots like it’s legal
Cops tryna find me like I’m Nino
I’m in Reno, geeking hoes down like I’m Z-Ro

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Bought a new bitch
And she white like work
If a nigga talking down
I got D Wade under my shirt
Monster truck rims on the Chevy
Got me up now
Water diamonds dancing in my chain
She wanna fuck now
Only time I drink soda
When I drink lean
Only time I’m geeking off
Is when I pop a bean
A nigga fuck with K $upreme
Then he fucking with me
Told these niggas not to trust me
I’m always gon' scheme
See that 32 is gon' stack
Put it in my backpack and watch it double up
Young RD from the 6 buckin on any nigga, I don’t give a fuck
Dumb dumb like a tow truck
On your gang gang, that’s a e-crash
Nigga want static that’s a e-smash
Nigga’s not really stacking up the cash
I been livin' life low sippin Barney tear [lean]
I can’t wait to move out so I can pierce my ears
Put them rocks on my shit, got me lit like like the first
I done told them niggas once, It’s time to re-im-burse
I done dropped a couple hundreds just for my shirt
Nigga’s name not Ferg but I put in work
Pullin' off in a beam, make em skrt skrt skrt
Bitches all up on my dick, that shit’s startin' to hurt
I been workin' all night so my mom won’t hurt
Chopper chopper make em jump like he praisin' the church
Man, I pray a fuck nigga step up on my turf
Bitch It’s Young RD and I’m balling like Dirk

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Yea motherfucka
You know my motherfucking name bitch
Yeah It’s Young RD
Shout out to them – shout out to them niggas that be on me
Niggas that got me fucked up all the way up
They thinkin' a nigga ain’t got shmoney
You know what I’m sayin, You feel me?
Niggas thinkin' a nigga ain’t got shmoney ya digg?
That nigga got me fucked up
From the 404 to the 212
Ya shmell that?
