[Intro]
Hahaha, ZoiD, HarZoiD, ZoiD
You know what Drake, do me a favor bro
Sing this chorus for me, i'll Thank You Later
Sike!

[Hook]
No elevator, no stone
Can get into my zone
I am in a class of my own
Calling BREACH on my trombone
And we known to get things right
Stardom is coming in sight
Yeah I'm sitting down up on top this throne, all day and all friggin' night
Cause I'm
I'm Higher in the sky, higher higher in the sky(what!) (3x)
I'm Higher in the Sky than all them kids that whomp whomping!

[Verse 1]
I do not fear
I am on top of my game where they cheer
For the ZoiD 24/7 at 7-11 with niggas who live off of beer
This throne is comfy, so I can adhere
Just snap my fingers and women appear
Shaking they rears, drop it to low gear
Flip it around, insert frontals here
I'm a mercenary, not precautionary (what?)
I killed Timmy Turner, lemme get his fairies
Many sides to me like a Tyler Perry
One sides super chill, the others Bloody Mary(ZoiD)
I ain't go no cars, I own rocketships
I like sexy women with some real big eyes (haha!)
Assuming I'm gunna rhyme, that is your demise
I'm so high, in the sky, that if I sneeze this worlds baptized!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The Montagues and Capulets still going at it
Welcome to modern times, here's an iPad and an automatic
Put em together, a heartbeat sensor, now that's enigmatic
My Doritos
Incognito
Got you running like wet burritos
ZoiD City lives on through today on the sum of it
Platinum Neptune still way out in front of it
Never going home get fined, Gregg popovich
Alberto Knox, Sophie's World, the Acropolis
Higher in the sky than all them kids that whomp whomping
Hungrier than little fat kids when they shopping
Does that seem familiar?
That shit is green goblin
Still saving the world with Batman and Robin!

[Hook]
