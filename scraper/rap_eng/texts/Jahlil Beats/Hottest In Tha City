[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly I'm flaming
Hotter than the whip I came in
Harder than the pavement
Dropping on these niggas back to back I'm raining
Cause you the top noodles like Ramen, save it

I'm the hottest in the city, got them rider niggas with me
They let me out the cell I was popping like I'm Diddy
Then Omelly came to scoop me with a chopper and a fifty
I'm like what it is what's really good
I be anywhere any block any hood
All my niggas ride hard like a hemi should
