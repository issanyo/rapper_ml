[Intro: Dave Chapelle Skit]
Got an eye problem Eddie?
You don't like that Eddie?
You don't like my feet on your couch?
On your coffee table?
Huh?
Fuck yo' couch nigga!
Fuck yo' couch

Jahlil Beats, holla at me

[Hook]
We step up in the club, fucking up the couches
Tell the bartender, we gon' order us some bottles
We ain't standing on the floor, fucking up the couches
Club gon' swole, fucking up the couches
DJ on go, fucking up the couches
I'm in here with my zoes, fucking up the couches
What we doing? Fucking up the couches, fucking up the couches
Fucking up the couch, fucking up the couches
Fucking up the couch, fucking up the couches
Fucking up the couch, fucking up the couches

[Verse 1]
Okay, standing on the couches screaming fuck the bouncer
Shmoney dancing on the sofa, feeling like I'm Bobby
Order up some bottles for the niggas 'round me
Bad bitches falling through, niggas catching bodies
Screaming fuck the other side, fuck the other side
You got a problem with my niggas, it's a homicide
Them zoes banging red and blue and they down to ride
You niggas better think about it 'fore you niggas try
Niggas hating in the club, we make it rain on 'em
We gon' take a nigga bitch and put the chain on her
We gon' play with the mind and run a game on her
And take shawty to the crib, put the pain on her

[Hook]
We step up in the club, fucking up the couches
Tell the bartender, we gon' order us some bottles
We ain't standing on the floor, fucking up the couches
Club on' swole, fucking up the couches
DJ on go, fucking up the couches
I'm in here with my zoes, fucking up the couches
What we doing? Fucking up the couches, fucking up the couches
Fucking up the couch, fucking up the couches
Fucking up the couch, fucking up the couches
Fucking up the couch, fucking up the couches

[Verse 2]
Okay, 100 bottles, 100 niggas, Oh yeah we mobbing
Jumping on couches, looking at bouncers like we wilding
Spending money, blowing cheques, we getting lit
And my haters see the watch across the room, flick of the wrist
All my niggas strapped, all my niggas jewelled up
Whole squad screaming gang, gang, nigga that's us
We Don't need no security, nigga back up
And I pray to God none of you niggas Dont act up
I'm in the club, I'm just standing on the couches
A young bitch with me rolling up some ounces
100 deep, we take over VIP
Whole gang with me, and we screaming FBG

[Hook]
We step up in the club, fucking up the couches
Tell the bartender, we gon' order us some bottles
We ain't standing on the floor, fucking up the couches
Club gon' swole, fucking up the couches
DJ on go, fucking up the couches
I'm in here with my zone, fucking up the couches
What we doing? Fucking up the couches, fucking up the couches
Fucking up the couch, fucking up the couches
Fucking up the couch, fucking up the couches
Fucking up the couch, fucking up the couches
