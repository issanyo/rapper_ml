Uhh... check it out
You need to get your snowboots on
And put on your big puffy jackets
Go turn the heater on
It's gonna get real cold
Frosty Takeovers

Freezo

Ill be spitting verses 'til I'm six feet
It gets deep
Turning instrumentals in to mince meat
Trap rapper hipster conscience back packer miss me
With labels I just spit heat

Like a circus acts
The worse is back
And never left
This God never rest
Send the message like the deity that make birkin bags

Take a minute to digest that type of simile
Make your mother hyperventilate she
Never heard a spitter quite as sick as me
Sniffle sniffle peep the imagery
Of one verse
Equal fifty sneezes
Mix with the symptoms seen in a
Leper and lupus
I brew a ill symphony
Leave my competition dead like chivalry (simple shit)

Shmoney dancing with some flys, boy, I been the shit
I'm one of a kind,you're like titties on the internet
I roll up a dime getting lifted with the syndicate
Spit some intricate writtens
Been as frigid as the winter gets

In my city
Chi city
Know that they vibe with me
Maybe so much they'll high five Willy
Or probably
Realise he got no friends and talks in third person
But if you did this beat you had a worse verse
Than freezo
Please bro

He's one cold cracker
Any other rappers no factor
The flows fatter than the whole cast of
Biggest loser. When the booth is occupied by me
I lose my fucking mind bold laughter
For whoever goes after

Been the best with writtens but I freestyle
Make any able-minded person feel senile
I'll see trial
In heaven God will dap me up like see child
You speak wild on anything you touched
Best believe I'll

Get you in
No simpleton
Will get it when they're listening
To anything I've laid after gripping pen
The visions been too potent too focus
You know that the flow is soul crippling
Game ready even though it's just conditioning


They got me in my bully yo
Every beat resting in paradise like Coolio
Bet I'mma dead it every time that I'm in the studio
My duty to run through these instrumentals
Guessing you should know
I'm chillin'
