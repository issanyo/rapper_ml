Uhm
Id like to tell you a story
It happened to me
In Wicker Park of all places

You know me
Sippin on that gria
Walk down the boulevard
Lighting up that greener
With the homies
And we shopping
We spending
We Chris Rocking
And this woman started talking
She say "Boy where your head at?
Drugs are straight for lames
Up in public, you be shamed."
I mean I guess its from the earth
In a grape juice bottle, it works
I no ratchet I no curse
I just want to turn up, live, and learn
24 this life i earned
Well
At least to me
Listen to me
I respect love family
Talk self-love and apologies
But this is America-home of free
So FUCK regulations
Restricting me
From smoking weed
Walking down on street
That's how it feels for me

Then I started to think about it some more and idk it kinda bothered me

Can you believe this bitch
Complaining bout the ganja
She smell like she smoke Newport's
So why hate Marijuana
Or maybe it's the drinking tho
But that ain't none of her problems
Cops can detain my ass until I'm speaking proper
And Marijuana's not an issue
Bc of ya boy Obama
They warn that its bad
Then send u home to momma
And that's all
My favorite season be fall
At least I'm not running round and jumping off of them walls
I mean my speech a little slurrrred
U can hear it in my wooords
She swear that she the shit but I think she just a turd
I mean I'm no role model
I'm no one to follow
Drunk and don't got the answers
I'm lonely and Cancer
Just barely not a bastard
But wait-
Think of the children
Or maybe its self-image
I mean look at my living
Oh he look cool what the fuck he sippin?
Shit be smelling strong
Lay you down like you at home
Who be blowing up his phone
He snaping on the chat
If u look this nigga up
He be snapping on the tracks
Follwed up on the gram?
Like them shits back to back
#daydrinking #griasback
Amen
