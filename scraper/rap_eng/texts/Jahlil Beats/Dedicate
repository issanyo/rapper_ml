[Intro: Marvelous]
Running Through y'all boys like its a track or something
Getting my way ill pull out some macs or something
Better beware because ill make y'all aware where im coming
Heard these boys hating on me because where im stunting
I don't talk that loud when I say ill clarify
If you have thoughts im coming by to testify, pray for my enemies
Because im that type of guy
Im going to make it to the top
I ain't gonna even deny

[Hook: Marvelous]
When it come to spitting man I dont play
Making sure it's heard from across the bay
That's my mentality everyday
To this music industry I can dedicate

[Verse 1: Marvelous]
Put in the work, ill get you murked
Im so absurd, the best you done heard
Respect im definitely gone earn
If y'all boys didn't know today y'all gone learn
Im the biggest and the realist of y'all rappers concerns
Wardrobe recent, my girls above decent
East coast beasting, ill bust if theirs a reason
I come harder than most every season
And trust me homeboy to my god I be kneeling
I look up at the ceiling cuz that's where im headed too
Im bringing my family and my whole crew
Im just being me and im gone stay true
They say hard work pays off man I already knew
Most people say I ain't competition
Well im going to turn their thoughts into a superstition
They gone beat me, man they only wish in
Better listen before you make any proposition
My whole clan strapped up
If we new cash then we sacked up
Of y'all fake boys man I had enough
Ill leave you burnt up and you think you tough
This rap and the streets is my occupation
Ain't no money from it yet but im still waiting
But don't worry cuz man imma make it
If somebody have it then im gone take it

[Hook: Marvelous]
When it come to spitting man I don't play
Make sure its heard from across the bay
Thats my mentality almost everyday
To this music industry I got to dedicate
