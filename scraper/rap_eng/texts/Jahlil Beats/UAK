[Intro: Rediroc]
Alright..

[Chorus: Jahlil Beats] (2x)
30 racks in my pocket, I just pulled up wit your hoe
Young nigga on fire, man, you niggas' already know
Bad bitch in my condo, I tell her to suck it, she go
Gettin' to that moula, man, you niggas' already know

[Verse 1: Rediroc]
Young nigga, I get it, bad bitches, I hit it
Fast life, I live it, talkin' bout money, nigga, I'm wit it
Reporting live from that kitchen, sit on top of my city
Smoke gas, bout a whole zone, we pop bottles of that Diddy
White dots and red dots, get wiped out from a head shot
Red bone wit her red bottoms, plus, her pussy pink
Plus, her head poppin
Rediroc, I know you heard about, trap around by the word of mouth
Dead presi's we murder bout, Thanksgiving; giving Turkey's out
AK's that'll chop em down, AK's that'll chop em up
911; Emergency, Ambulance, come and mop em up
You can call that a murder scene, Ape Gang, we the murder team
Whole script full of Percosets and
We wash it down with promethazine
I don't just lean, I extra lean, dirty money but, I'm extra clean
Your baby mom on my 5s, and keep textin me to have sex with me
Said "you gotta give me top first", and
Sent her to straight to my block list, fast cash or slow bucks
It's 30 racks in my pocket, aye!

[Chorus: Jahlil Beats] (2x)

[Verse 2: Rediroc]
Liven Legendz up higher, Hot Boy, I'm on fire
No killers for hire, Snoop & Chris from the wire
I break the bird into pieces, and, drop down in the fire
I Ferragamo my belt buckle and I BBC my attire
Man, my whole life been in grind mode
Cook the shit with my eyes closed, wrap my head wit a blind fold
I'll give you 36, plus 5 more
On schemes, that's the money plan, I don't bop
I do the money dance, whole thing, that's a 1,000 grams
And, you're hood rich with a 100,000 grand
Haters hate cuz they can't win
Don't burn a bridge if you can't swim, late nights in the trap house
Early mornings in the mansion
I like Girls that like Girls, we link up and do 1 thing
Handgun was FN, all gold for a young king
I don't just shine, I super shine, I don't flash, I'm shooting mine
Anything that I got dropped on me, I ain't sit on nothin'
I was moving mine
Whole verse is dope boy, cook it up and you got me
Pulled up wit your hoe in it, with 30 racks in my pocket, aye!

[Chorus: Jahlil Beats] (2x)
