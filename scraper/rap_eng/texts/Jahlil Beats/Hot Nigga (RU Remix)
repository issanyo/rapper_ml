[Intro]
Yeah
This what you waited for
A little bit
Perfect
Eyo
Vamos

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I'm superior to a hot nigga
Where I'm from I'm a scorching puerto rock nigga
I be sonning these kids like I'm your pop nigga
Jum' & Mena waiting on this, bus stop nigga

'Tis the date they knew I had to make a move
Federico's who I fucking owe it to
He be asking, "When you dropping something new?"
But I be screwed studying in Rutgers U

Oohh! Mettler's where I'm at now
No Tinie Tempah but we party to pass out
You ain't getting in, what the fuck mad 'bout?
You ain't got ratio? Get up out the frat house

Fuck a morning session it's bound to be stressing
I learned my lesson and regretting every fucking second
No question no 8AMs, dine at Livi
Just got here already devil's trying to get me

I'm 18 class of '18 freshman
Subway can't get you this fresh, man
I ain't playing games like in Rutgers Zone
Nomadic lyricist, boy fuck a home

Super Hot Fire, no glasses on
But I got the jacket and shirt set off the alarm
Been three a fourth one won't do any harm
Smooth criminal, cause I jack sun alien ant farm

RU fat sandwich flow, cause I'm heart stopping
More bars than the ones crooks get locked in
Bossing, never Shy enough to say that I'm so fucking
Awesome I'm so fucking awesome

I post up my lyric, but most ya'll don't get it
Analyze it like an Expository Written
Flow sick on some Brower shit, I been great
One other thing, Fuck Penn State!
Yeah
Fuck Penn State!
I been great
Fuck Penn State!
