[Intro]
Bust It (3x)

[Verse: 1]
[?] do it for the thirsty
Waves spinning, ask her if she want to surf
She drop it down, I told her whistle while she twerk
Saying that she never did it but i know this ain't the first
Whoa whoa
Real hitta in ya presence what you gon' do
Shorty bust it right in front of me
I call it lunch line
Ya heard me on the radio, she said true
She pulled her own money out, saying she don't want me
Party party they don't understand me
Man she, just get on top and ride it like a banshee
And they trappin' in the alley way, don't let the feds see
Stacking money boy ya paper thinner than a bed sheet, cousin
She seen me at the mall
Be like aww man wasn't he the boy who got the song that make us all dance
Bust it
You move to much I'm stopping like a walkman honey
Tell the blood swing the trees like he Tarzan cousin (Whoa)

[Hook]
Bust it, gone bust it open its ya song girl
Bust it, out here in the house like Jerome girl
Bust it, bottles and [?] and Patron girl
Bust it, down here in the zone lets get it on

Bust (7x), now bend it over
Bust (7x), now bend it over

[Verse:2]
She can do it with no hands and make it twerk
She said this ain't what you want like Lil Durk
Gotta body bang a [?] like a hearse
50 bottles make it light up she said church
Shorty said she's tryna surfboard, surfboard
Bust it open, she can twerk boy twerk boy
Check up on her like a nurse ward, nurse ward
Be too late she call me thirst boy, worst boy
Check me out, whoa
Chick bad took her to the house call me Trick Dad
Wrist flash, told her to break her off like a Kit-Kat
Got filla, straight Tigga, my top hitta
Ride with us, slide in her, I'm so chilla
