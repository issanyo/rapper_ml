[Intro]
I know why you mad, nigga, yeah
I know why you mad, nigga
Jahlil Beats, holla at me!

[Verse 1]
Uh, I said my neck like "bling"
My wrist like "blaow"
These niggas jacking my flows and stealing my style
You niggas sounding so old, I'm looking like now
I'm 'bout to cop a Bugatti, these niggas like "How?"
'Cuz I'm young and I get it
Biggest P on my fitted
Money knockin', who is it?
My money come with them bitches
'Cause bitches don't come with money
Niggas be looking funny
My bank account full of commas, and my pockets be full of hundreds
Bounce with me, smoke an ounce with me
That nigga sellin' bricks? Tell him bring a house with it
My nigga like a wide receiver, run a route with it
He show you how to get it in and move it out with it
I say, all my niggas talk bricks
My dawgs don't rap
I'm the only one spittin', my dawgs sell crack
Say, y'all talking that shit, oh I be in that Trap
Riding around with that Mac, whoa

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' money, I'm fucking hoes
I got a hoe that be on that fucking pole
And she be on that fuckin' pole
And that mean that she fuckin' [?]

I like bitches and money, I like money and bitches
Yeah she famous, we fuckin, but it ain't none of yo business
All these niggas be hatin', I don't fuck with them niggas
I let them niggas keep hating, I keep on fucking they bitches, wassup

[Verse 2]
I say bitch shake that ass, gone shake them titties
Bitch, shake that ass like you work at Magic City
She loving the crew, I ain't talking 'bout Drizzy
Probably run with OVO, and I be in Toronto city, whoa!
