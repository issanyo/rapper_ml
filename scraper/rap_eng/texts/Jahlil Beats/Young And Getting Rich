(Hook: Spida)

I wake up in the morning, knowing I got to grind, first thing I'm thinking about is it's almost my time, I'm balling out on full-blitz these niggas hate that I shine, and I see why they hating on me, can't accept my stride, I'm young and I'm killing shit, young trying to get stupid rich, young riding in a stupid whip, and if a nigga hate I got hate-o-glispe, young and I'm killing shit, young and I'm killing shit, I'm young and I'm killing shit, young and I'm getting rich

(Verse 1: Julian)

Ok I wake up in the morning, trynna get this money, cuz these streets ain't no joke and I ain't even being funny, I got l7 to the left of me, these chicken heads ain't stressing me, and I'mma take over this rap game, ain't nobody letting me,said I'm just trynna do me , and that's when they all hate ya, but old girls gone love me when I come back with that paper,imma hit my city and we go live it all night, and all my homies that was there for me gone be set for life, I'll never forget my homies, never forget my dad, never forget when when we was broke and each other was all we had, yeah boy is Julian, they say I'm good on this mic, and I'mma steady keep grinding, until we good for life

(Hook: Spida)

(Verse 2: Julian)

Ok now thank God for my health, Thank God for this mic, Thank God for my family, and Thank God for my life, if I don't grind them I'mma die, times hard when it get like that, think I'mma let a dude stop me, these haters can't hold me back
Shout-out to my team, boy I swear we came with it, cuz after you say that prayer, boy you gotta go get it, all them nights we was hungry, but now more living basic, and it's almost my time, boy I swear that I can taste it, chicks saying that I done changed, I just say I'm on to better things, they always want something from me, nobody getting this wedding ring, started at the bottom, yet I made it out and I ain't gone stop til I get mines, watch how everything play out I'm gone!
