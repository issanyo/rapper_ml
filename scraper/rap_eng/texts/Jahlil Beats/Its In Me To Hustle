[Hook x2]
It's in me to hustle, work my muscle
It's in me to blow your ass out for a duffle
It's in me to cut a nigga head, if he get wrong
I'm out here, fighting, hungry so get wrong

[Verse 1]
Guns keys pounds beans
Nigga be bringing all this cheese
Nigga be out here hatin' on me
Nigga I'm real I'm from the streets
North Memphis, real killa nigga we get that gasoline
Set him on fire, dump that body, nigga my hood, nigga never gonna leave
Blue crush, real crush, my young niggas say fuck police
My young niggas pop pills, smoke weed
My young niggas are wild as me
My young niggas invade your home
My young niggas put bullets in domes
Hold him down, duck tape to the face click boom
I can make it happen, doors kicked in I jacked it
40.000 on your head, you might wanna stop laughin'
You might wanna stop flaggin', you might wanna start packin'
You might wanna start rappin', you violate we blastin'

[Hook x2]
