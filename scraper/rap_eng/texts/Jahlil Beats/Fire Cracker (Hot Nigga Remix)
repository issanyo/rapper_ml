... They in dire need of a rapper
... Who rhymes with a bit of passion
... More lines than a sniffing addict
Combine them all and you got the fire breathing cracker!


They wish I quit so Im Fed up
Because I know I spit better
Than these fellas, none even spit clever
Just you grip a clip and how you get cheddar, so 'bout time i let my pen talk like Winchester


I'm a rap addict, who's back at it
I slap faggot with a glass bottle till the glass smashes
That's it I've had it with these dumb fucking wack rappers dropping bad tracks, acting plastic, getting famous I swear these fans are mad spastic

Only the strongest survive so the weaker go (weaker go)
Doing that dancee, looking like a queer bro (queer bro)
Acting like a fag, i guess you need a ho
In the scene im known, world tour where I need to go

Your so scared, don't go there
Talk shit, get your throat teared I don't care
I'm so rare
Put your hands together like the Lord's here
Then get hit with a broken chair
RKO out of nowhereeee

Don't act surprised or deny im nicest
This tracks on fire, it's my time I'm rising
Get slashed up violent with a 3d maneuver like he ain't a human it's attack on titan

Just because I'm a rapper I don't claim to be rock hard
Last time i went clubbing, I got drunk and got dropped hard
I'm joking, I slipped, I'm a rock star
I still watch pokemon, live at home in my mom's yard
I don't even smoke weed and drink in a pub for old men
They ask what is real, so just show them
Fakers? Haters? Snakes? Fuck them Couldn't care, I got loads of close friends

They say quality over quantity
But everything I drop it quality so quantity is what they want from
Truthfully I don't see any artist as competition
For monster writens and rap with more presence than stocking filliers
