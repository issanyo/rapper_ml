[Chorus]
You know I got it all from the dirt
He ain’t put in work, now he hurt
But you know I don’t play wit’ my money
You know I don’t fuck around wit’ my money bag
Droppin’ water, I been runnin’ to the cash now
I know they wish that I was broke or doin’ bad now
But you know I don’t play wit’ my money
You know I don’t fuck around wit’ my money bag

[Verse 1]
If you got a dream, you better chase that
They been sleepin’ on the kid but I don’t take naps
She see the rapper, now shawty wanna taste that
Yeah, long hair don’t care like I’m A$AP
Bitch, get off my line I’m on the fucking road
I live my life like every day’s another episode
Niggas hate but want a ticket to my shows, yeah
I see right through you like Rihanna clothes
If yo’ bitch a snack, my bitch a full plate
I done made it out the hood without a cell mate
Still tryna move my brodie out the trap house
Movin’ so much weight he almost blew his back out
She gon’ keep throwin’ that ass if I throw cash out
Cause I’m the only rapper only spittin’ facts out
And I still sit around the house wit’ all my chains on
Cause I ain’t ever goin’ back to where I came from

[Chorus]
You know I got it all from the dirt
He ain’t put in work, now he hurt
But you know I don’t play wit’ my money
You know I don’t fuck around wit’ my money bag
Droppin’ water, I been runnin’ to the cash now
I know they wish that I was broke or doin’ bad now
But you know I don’t play wit’ my money
You know I don’t fuck around wit’ my money bag

[Verse 2]
Damn, what’s the problem?
Tell me how I did all of this without a album
Young nigga speaking for a couple thousand
Keep the circle small, you see how they did Malcolm
Get yo’ paper, get yo’ paper, get yo’ money
I did it my way, they can’t take nothin’ from me
I know they wish that I was ashy, broke, and bummy
Cause now I’m probably in they Women Crush tummy
Ayi-yi-yi-yi, Why does everybody die growing up on this side?
Got gorillas in a Jag with AK’s on they thighs
If it’s beef, bullets long as French fries
You can catch a super size, yeah super size
City of the lost, hope you make it out alive
See my brodie caught a body and he got a couple priors
They only caught ‘em cause he dropped the Cannon like Mariah

[Chorus]
You know I got it all from the dirt
He ain’t put in work, now he hurt
But you know I don’t play wit’ my money
You know I don’t fuck around wit’ my money bag
Droppin’ water, I been runnin’ to the cash now
I know they wish that I was broke or doin’ bad now
But you know I don’t play wit’ my money
You know I don’t fuck around wit’ my money bag
You know I got it all from the dirt
He ain’t put in work, now he hurt
But you know I don’t play wit’ my money
You know I don’t fuck around wit’ my money bag
Droppin’ water, I been runnin’ to the cash now
I know they wish that I was broke or doin’ bad now
But you know I don’t play wit’ my money
You know I don’t fuck around wit’ my money bag
