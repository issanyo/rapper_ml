Jahlil Beats, Holla at me
Yeah(x2)
Good Enough
I make music for who the fuck said that in people i coudn't trust
Going stupid like shortabus and these people are new to us
Steady making the music stuff and these tracks that you shoudn't touch
I'ma keep goin' and goin' till i become fucking good enough
Bitch i'm in the buildin' why you act like i'm not?
Is it cuz you listen to me and you think i'm not hot?
Sorry for not connecting to your hip hop prefrences
Ain't got time for this shit i got to connect to some confrences
I be doin' it big business, concepts
You doin' it small, plan this, first steps baby shit
Someone needs to change you like a diaper
But leave your girlfriend cuz I think i really like her
Take these woman out to dinner cuz I'm classy man
And I think I took your girl, she like a fancy man
You tryin to get her back, you doin' everythin' you can
But your shit is a disaster like in Japan
Bitches had a couple drinks and now they fellin' tipsy
I ain't even have one, now im feelin' crispy
Women out they drizzy should they askin' ,what you miss me?
I don't listen to what they say, I want one to kiss me
But I got to move, movin' to the fuckin' booze
Spitin' out my fouls after that I think I say i'll do
Marryin' hip hop, Oova, a big shot, hes only fifteen and his music career just flopped
Yeah I got more haters than the triple K
People think that I'm delutional, hey you okay?
Yeah man I'm alright, I be doin' fine
Even though, well most everybody just hits my lines
Gotta step up my rappin' skills for these ordeals
People in my town sayin' that I'm not real
And they refuse to buy my shit, no money for meals
I ain't even got even connects, no chance for a deal
I've been slept on so much I'm a matress
Haters call me a fake, and a fucking actress
This is real as it gets, you can't act this
This my life and not yours, can't have this
AMCC Insta Crew you can't hate that
If you do well then you probably just hate rap
You rep an issue too man thats some swag jack motherfuckas thinkin' that we do not want our swag back
ASF up, A Town down
Ain't nobody really messin' with me right now
I'm the only one out of yall doin' this
I'm the only one you ever see doin' it big
Like I'm Big Sean, cuz I do it
Livin' every day like it was a movie
You can snap yourself a picture with an Nikon
Turn the lights off, cuz' I'm on
Yeah
Good Enough
ASF up
Let's Do it, Let's Do it
Yeah
