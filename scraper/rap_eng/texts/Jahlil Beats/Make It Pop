[Chorus: Lore'l]
Bang bang, it ain't nothing but a "G thang"
We getting money, you fronting until that heat bang
I can make it hot in this motherfucker
I can make it pop in this motherfucker

[Verse 1: Lore'l]
Billion dollar pussy, Porsche FF
Dude chop a block, yeah, he a top chef
I'ma need you to back track 5 steps
Niggas telling on themselves, just look at G.Dep
My shoes interrogating, confused the situation
Chanel shades on, my views simply amazing
Gold for gold leave the grammy's with a winner
Spend a few racks on a (?)
That's minor, fucking with the majors
Peeling off paper; Charlie Sheen neighbor
Gotta couple Derwins playing for the Sabors
Your bitch in a Pacer, I'm with Dan Granger
Ring like a glacier, love me a hater, hate me; a dumb trick
You the one that payed her
I can get it up up like an elevator, give yourselves a hand
Fucking masturbators

[Chorus: Lore'l] (2x)
Bang bang, it ain't nothing but a "G thang"
We getting money, you fronting until that heat bang
I can make it hot in this motherfucker
I can make it pop in this motherfucker

[Verse 2: Lore'l]
Bear on the Birkin, villain (?)
One thing for sure, that money better be certain
Indecent exposure; Peewee Herman
Make em wanna spend that bread, he determined
(?) blunts to the head, lost a lot of good sponsors to the feds
Parade around, dolled up, yeah, bitch stylish
My money grown; out of state college
Cocaine alley, I know how to whip it, double on the digit
Stupid ass bitches
Mass appeal, you know I spit game vicious
Hell of a night, say hi to the Mrs
Everybody taking pictures, cover girl pose
Pay attention, I support hoes
Got them back stage working my hoes
Keep my pussy bald like the head on Amber Rose

[Chorus: Lore'l] (2x)
Bang bang, it ain't nothing but a "G thang"
We getting money, you fronting until that heat bang
I can make it hot in this motherfucker
I can make it pop in this motherfucker
