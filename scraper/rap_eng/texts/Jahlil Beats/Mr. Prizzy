[Verse 1: Pryde]
They call me Mister Mister Prizzy getting iffy with yo chicky
Ask her do you like my body body body? Anna Nikki
I’m Leonardo Davincci turn you rappers into minced meat
And balling like a Hornet when I say my lyrics krispy
Bass still bumpin’ you can bring on up your best rhymes
Spitting like a threat I just rip out your intestines
I be I be I be starting drama
Popping proper and your girlfriend choosing fast
She a rama-dama mama
My music gives you the pleasure and got you in amazement (oh my god)
Wanna really beat your ass as doma dominatrix
You showed up to the party but I got way hotter mommies
Wait you left home empty handed?
Well we just rocked the same-ish
Thang is I’m never rockin’ over priced clothes
I stay lower budget clothed from my dome to my toes
Maybe it’s my snazzy-ness it’s super nice amaze-able
Maybe it’s my geeky-ness or maybe it’s the way I talk
Think about it this dear you think it’s weird
I may an all asian the two thing this year (asian)
And yeah I might be sick in it
Maybe you can play me if your little future kids are mixed
You got a light skin thick thighs
Your baby gon' be eating rice all chink eyed
Oh that’s your girl? I address that girl as Ms. Pryde
Pull her ten feet closer I’m gonna start to yell out IT’S MINE!
Transformin’ on beats you can call me Optimis Prime
Squeaky clean lyrics got my sick lines spit shined
Homie is my tick time
Walking like something’s wrong
Twenty dollar outfit with a Louie belt buttoned on (on)
I met ya’ll brag they be like why you do that?
I’m like that’s my swag
My style ain’t generic I’m too good and I cold
I’m the reason why your girlfriend wanna put you on hold (on hold)
I don’t play girls that ain’t what I’m really like
I just take ‘em if their men don’t treat ‘em right
So if she never calls you can blame my personality
She about to the one (one) comin’ home with me tonight
Play around and said it
At this moment I be relishing
To get you pissed I’ll waste a couple bars for the hell of it
Bammer Bammer Bammer Bammer Bammer
Woo Woo
Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga
Choo Choo
The Far East Movement all you dudes are hardly hittin
Mister D to the Prizzy
I’m the Asian Barney Stinson (huh huh)
I think I’m Neil Harris
You got a weak appearance
Flow is so evil you can run and tell the people that I’m

[Hook]
