Magazine Bitch

I gotta magazine bitch
A magazine bitch
She on the covers
Between the sheets

Verse 1
She looks good looks fine sexy
Even when she ain't trying she's blessed b
Ballers traveling back and forth call the Refs please
Tryna run game like  the Esp's
Yes please  I'm her  bestie
Queen to a King like a chess piece
Cold demo and she's getting big cash
I know u players Figure digga dig that

Chorus
I gotta magazine bitch
I gotta magazine bitch
She's on the covers between the sheets

Verse 2
Her booty's  XXL and she cute
OOOOOH King Ses Rick Flair GQ
Yeah that's suit and tie stupid fly
She loves a boss got the source
And the coolest vibe
Pussy gun smoke and she ain't fronting
Face on Vogue  ass on Straight Stuntin
Never mattered she's tatted like Urban Ink
Taking selfless Niggas thirsty wanna slurp and drink

Chorus
I gotta magazine bitch
I gotta magazine bitch
She's on the covers between the sheets

Verse 3
I need her like a bad habit
Ass jumping Ass Jumping like a Jack rabbit
Her ex is a clown he made her run for  hills
When i started to hit it right
I made her come formal
Love everything about her yeah thats nice time
You gonna see her in the forbes she's a tight dime
She loves me Cuz  she said my mind's  complex
Rolling my stones get high and have bomb sex


Chorus
I gotta magazine bitch
I gotta magazine bitch
She on the  covers between the sheets
