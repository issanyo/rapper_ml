[Verse 1]
You drink more than you used to
Fell in love, how could you?
Trust your heart like only fools do
Go on, let it bleed
You smoked 10, now it’s 20
Bet you wish you’d never met me
To stick around, you must be crazy
Go on, let it bleed

[Hook]
I told you never to get used to me
I stay awake when you fall asleep
I'm a whole lotta trouble
We're in a whole lotta trouble
I told you, you should never follow me
But here we are, and you're in too deep
I'm a whole lotta trouble
We're in a whole lotta trouble

[Verse 2]
You shout louder than you used to
And you hold on tighter in the bedroom
Stick around like I'mma change soon
Go on, let it bleed
As you stand there trying to save me
Use your head
And baby, leave me
Gonna take much more than a lot to save me
Go on let it bleed

[Hook]
I told you never to get used to me
I stay awake when you fall asleep
I'm a whole lotta trouble
We're in a whole lotta trouble
I told you, you should never follow me
But here we are, and you're in too deep
I'm a whole lotta trouble
We're in a whole lotta trouble

[Bridge]
Run away now, turn your back on me
You'll be praying, for the strength to leave

[Hook]
I told you never to get used to me
I stay awake when you fall asleep
I'm a whole lotta trouble
We're in a whole lotta trouble
I told you, you should never follow me
But here we are, and you're in too deep
I'm a whole lotta trouble
We're in a whole lotta trouble
