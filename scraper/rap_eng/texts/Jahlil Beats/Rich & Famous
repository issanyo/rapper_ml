[Intro: Meek Mill]
Aye, shorty I'mma tell you like this
I know you used to messing with them ordinary guys
But, uh
The way I'm getting money
I can introduce you to a lifestyle you gon' love forever
It's Double-M-G

[Hook: Louie V]
I wanna buy your love, tell me what it's gon' be?
I wanna buy your love, everything is on me
Lifestyle of the rich and the famous
Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?
Lifestyle of the rich and the famous
Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?
I wanna buy your...

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Riding through my city with a chick I used to lust
Bout to make a movie starring me, the two of us
Penthouse at the top floor, elevator shooters up
So I can eat that pussy for breakfast, dinner, and lunch
And uh, she been waiting all night for this hard pipe
I think she called twice
Before you knew it I pulled in she seen them fog lights
And I can see it in her face she had a hard night
Up and down that pole selling dreams, selling love
It was sort of like she serving fiends and selling drugs
Giving them a fix, body solid as a brick
With no baking soda on it I went raw every time I hit
Life's a bitch but I go deep up in that pussy Jerry Rice
And every time I'm in the building I ain't never like
She be on that pole, tryna chase her goals
Going up and down like that angel on that Rolls. Lord Knows!

[Hook: Louie V]
I wanna buy your love, tell me what it's gon' be?
I wanna buy your love, everything is on me
Lifestyle of the rich and the famous
Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?
Lifestyle of the rich and the famous
Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?
I wanna buy your...

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, Shorty so pretty and that pussy so good
She used to say I was crazy, I was up to no good
Till I slid all in it, started fucking her good
Red bottom, I damn near had a crush in the hood
I slid up in an Aston, she heard the pipes they were growling
Friends wanting to fuck me because they like how I'm styling
But I'm cool on the snaking cause I like when she smiling
We gon' Lear in the air just to get right on an island
We ball harder in Bal Harbour out in Florida
Isabel Marant sneakers, you got all of them
Tatted up, passports just to cross borders
She calling me daddy and I ain't got a daughter
Said I'm cooler than them other dudes
Five racks just to get her Cinderella shoes
Hella Jewels, Money come in different revenues
Big Paper, your money smaller then that Kevin dude

[Hook: Louie V]
I wanna buy your love, tell me what it's gon' be?

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
She gripping on my H belt, but I tell her grab it for me
She was messing with me way before I had the money
You niggas playing games, I'm getting Madden money
Just to commentate, peep how I operate
I put your chick up in this ghost, Bet she cooperate
I really balling, tat em all up in and out of state
Been getting money for a while, I don't know how to hate
They call me racked up shorty, she can smell the Aura
Had her out in Bora exploring like she was Dora
Million dollar sponsor, spoiled her like my daughter
And put her in the game, She ain't fucking with lames
