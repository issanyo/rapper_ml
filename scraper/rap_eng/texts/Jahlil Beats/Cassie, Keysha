(Intro)
Cassie, Keysha (8x)

(Verse 1)
Eyo I was at this club last night
They call it Cam, inside I saw a half-pipe
Man I laughed right, babygirl's class like
Mercedes so I knew the cash's right
That ass white, baby was a fast type
Chillin with a beer talkin' bout the past like
Her man never gave it to her ass right
So I kept talkin', gave an ass bite
That lady took me home after that
One more drink all I did is laughin' back
She draged me through the hallway, threw me on the rack
Humpin' and bumpin' all night like a mack
In fact I wanna take all her money
Open the vault takin' all her money
That bitch so classy, inside so nasty
I got what I wanted so I left Cassie (Oh)

(Bridge)
Steppin in the club
Baby wuzzup?
I pay you one more drink for another hug
Baby take me home
I kno you wanna bone
Let me give it to you all night long

(Hook)
More girls like Cassie Keysha
Can you be like Cassie Keysha
Where can i get Cassie Keysha
I wanna bone Cassie Keysha

(Verse 2)
Hey Keysha how you doin girl
Keysha always be like: Im good Sir!
So we talkin and laughin again
Walkin and half of the men
Lookin at me like
Pokin' and cash fo' the man?
That's right
I can bang and n get cash
Keysha got a house fulla cams with no flash
I keep do it carefully
Really carefully
No abuse it is still fair to me
This bitch looks to me like an x wife
She never wanted to talk about her sex life
She mad cuz she didn't met me before
I'm glad that she didn't met me before
Cuz I never wanna spend ma life pay a ho
I'd rather stay alone bookin everyday a ho
I wanna girl like Cassie, Keysha
Or A.N.N, pass me Lisa

(Bridge)
Steppin in the club
Baby wuzzup?
I pay you one more drink for another hug
Baby take me home
I kno you wanna bone
Let me give it to you all night long

(Hook)
