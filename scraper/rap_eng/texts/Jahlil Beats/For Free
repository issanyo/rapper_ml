[Intro]
Yeah, it's like 3 in the morning, haha

[Chorus: T-Dot illdude]
I can show you finer things if you come with me
Hit the mall and get you anything you fucking see
Paid the cost to be the boss, that's a heavy fee
But being with a real nigga, that's for free
That's for free
Being with a real nigga, that's for free
That's for free, cuz I'm sucka free
Being with a real nigga, that's for free

[Verse 1: Rediroc]
I'm bout my money everyday, I'm tryna get me some
I'm bout that money cuz that money make them bitches cum
The type of money make her sister to come
You never had a real nigga, better get you one
It's Rediroc, ha, bitch I'm burnin' up
Hotter than that fire under pots when we turn it up
Cooler than my jewelry, plus, she know I got my burner on
Last time she hugged, said she felt it and it turned her on
That's light shit, that's light shit, do it on some Nike shit
The reason why your girl agreed to take the overnight shift
All you do is check her phone and argue all night shit
I'm nothin' like a cop but, I beat it with my night stick
She loved that, tell me how you love that
Come to VIP where the bottles and the drugs at
Everything is paid for, don't worry bout a fee
Fuckin' wit a real nigga, you could get that shit for free
On me, Redi

[Chorus: T-Dot illdude]
I can show you finer things if you come with me
Hit the mall and get you anything you fucking see
Paid the cost to be the boss, that's a heavy fee
But being with a real nigga, that's for free
That's for free
Being with a real nigga, that's for free
That's for free, cuz I'm sucka free
Being with a real nigga, that's for free

[Verse 2: Rediroc]
What's already understood, no need to explain
Everything 100, I put that on my chain
You ain't gotta second guess the shit that I be sayin'
You can look at me and tell that this a different kinda thing
I had a couple Queens on my California King
Sometimes I get to chokin', give em pleasure from this pain
Sometimes I pull her hair and make her say my name
Keep her comin' back to back, that's the reason why she came
Ain't no reason for the games, take it easy, have a seat
Hit this reefer, Iook, I'm Redi, glad we got the chance to meet
They say I got it rockin', got my name from off the street
And, not only will I feed you, but I'll teach you how to eat
Baby, that's boss shit, yeah, baby that's boss shit
I'm on airplane mode, we don't sweat the small shit
We do this all year, in the Spring, Summer, fall shit
I give this to you free, I ain't even gonna charge ya
Redi

[Chorus: T-Dot illdude]
