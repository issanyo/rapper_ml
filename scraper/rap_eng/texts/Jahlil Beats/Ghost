I was told I could never do it
Spit positive and have others listen to it

Well I learned Not Everything
Is what seems
If you believe in God put him
Over everything

I wonder what would have happened
If I quitted from the begin
When I listened to what others said

But Im Happy never let unimportant words  get into my head
But this is what they'd say

You'll Never make or Fake till you do
Basically do Everything Instead of beening you

Don't see from your point of view
I get the bigger picture
You abstract art got distorted views

Im was born a winner
I don't like to lose
Survival of the fittest

Not everybody Got the Heart to start
But I see though to the end I'mma finished
You can seat there and  witness Me

Chorus (0:58)
Give my All in everything till I'm Ghost. (X3)
Till I'm 6 feet deep that you boy Ghost

(V2)

Either you follow or take the Lead
Sick of seeing you Carbon copies
Trying be Pro you average joe's
Looking kinda of sloppy Unoriginal you copies

I'm Of a different breed
Don't put me in the same category
I'm Good with or without the money
No need look at me funny
I don't give you what you want
I give you what you need

Drop a gems than I'm outty
I gotta leave

Not many want to hear the truth
Rather to be lied to
With the answers in front

Don't want to open the eyes
All I see in this world
Is a buncha wannabes

Everybody follow suit
Anit nobody wanna lead

You claim boss but you
Still playing secretary

No not me no not me
No not me no not me

Chorus (0:58)
Give my All in everything till I'm Ghost. (X3)
Till I'm 6 feet deep that you boy Ghost


(I dont think ya'll believe that God blessed me with the ability to rap yet So You gone get this Work!)


(V3)

You make me mad I have two side
You met Doctor Jackel this time for Mister Hide

Real ppl wasn't shooting with me in the gym
I got trade a better team
For Bigger better things

Infinite and beyond you rappers
Buzz light years a head of your class

When I Got affiliated the with the boss
The King of Kings
He gave me Visine now I got clear eyes

Even My enemies that underestimated
Me ain't even a factor

When you win the will of the master
Not way you can beat

So you can continue to hate
Till  I hit my death and
I meet the Holy Ghost

Until Im Ghost (3x)Till
I'm 6 feet deep then you boys Ghost
