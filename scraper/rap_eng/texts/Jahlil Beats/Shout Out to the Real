[Intro: DJ Khaled & Meek Mill]
Uhh, DJ Khaled
Yeah
Meek Milly
Yo, turn the music up a little bit
We The Best
Yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Free Boosie, real nigga
In the jail standing tall like Shaquille nigga
I used to say, "I know how you feel, nigga"
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Had my hood hating, I done came up
I don’t know if it’s the money or the fake stuff
Got me walking through the jungle with my flame tucked
Got around my juries since they want to see me chained up
Friends turn to foes when you're in a Rolls
Model bitches turn to hoes cause a nigga froze
Got them people taking pictures, let a nigga pose
Cause I get paid for reading scripts, been getting shows
Poppin' bottles it sound like a Mac-10
Phantom be so big, beep when I back in
I dropped a quarter milli on an Aston
And I ain’t got an album, but I got these niggas balling out
I’m gone

[Chorus: Meek Mill & DJ Khaled]
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job-
Ace Hood

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Yeah, bought a chopper for my problems, that banana type
Seen a millie, now it’s hard for me to sleep at night
I’m the type to flood the rollie like it's New Orleans
Bet that all my niggas ball like I’m Mr. Clean
From the bottom to the top, I made it out the gutter
I’m 17 on every scene I need my bread and butter
Used to run the streets, but now I’m running every summer
Right back on my bullshit like a Chicago lover
Feel like I'm jumping up out that phantom on my cocky ass
Know they hating, I just tell 'em kiss the paper tags
Still be with them pretty bitches, save for Stacy Dash
Plus my rollie cost me 80, that's gon' make 'em mad
Free my niggas locked, free my nigga caged
Fuck the system yeah you know we on the same page
Niggas love it when you're drowning in that water, dawg
Hate to see a nigga shining like some Armor All
Loyalty over royalty that’s my common law
We The Best: the logo, and I'm with my fucking boss
He just tell me murder niggas would think of Holocaust
Kill the hottest young'n in and what you niggas thought

[Chorus: Meek Mill, Plies, & DJ Khaled]
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute) (Ace, what up)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to-
Plies

[Verse 3: Plies]
They took a half a M nigga, out the bank nigga
If you want to whip 'em pussy nigga, blank nigga
And I put that red dot right where you think nigga
Hood nigga still wearing cuban linx nigga
I’m on the ave. nigga riding in a cutlass
You that talking nigga, you know you a pussy
A real nigga, real life, no rap shit
And I can promise you this ain’t what you want, bitch
30 mill and I still ain't been to LIV nigga
‘Cause I was to busy to gutter with the real niggas
When you see me in the field tell me how you feel nigga
And we some kids to each other if you real nigga
And they ain’t telling none of my young nigga to chill, nigga
We all shooters, nigga, and all us on the pills nigga
Ain’t got a yacht, but nigga the size of Shaquille, nigga
And before you try me nigga you better write your will, nigga

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
