[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Rolled up with the doors up
Niggas say they everywhere, they never showed up
I'm the shit, niggas turn there nose up
I be with my bread like some cold cuts
Every time I see myself coming up
Niggas start hating, what they want from us?
I can't figure out the way they run they mouth
Niggas acting like bitches, oughta wear a blouse
Still pouring that purple stuff in my Fanta
Got choppers and shooters inside my phantom
Strap up if some shit jumped off then I'm bustin'
If you make it out, my nigga, you lucky
Cause I'm faded and I'm ready
And I'm strapped up about my money
And these hoes is crazy, still suck the dick after I played them
And they know I fucked them and leave them
And when I'm in public act like i don't see them*
And they still love me, when I don't feed them
These bitches is greedy give up after the genie
Ferrari switchin' roads
Faster than the money coming from the shows
Niggas know I paved the way, gave up a brick to every city
I created the flow, you niggas is New Jack City


[Hook: Juicy J]
Throw dem racks watch how they react
Throw dem racks watch how they react
Watch them break there back
Throw that ass back
They act a fool for them damn racks
Throw dem racks watch how they react
Throw dem racks watch how they react
Watch them break there back
Throw that ass back
They act a fool for them damn racks

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Look up that’s me
All the way up at the top
Maserati candy apple I just copped it fresh off the lot
My career legendary I think that they must of forgot
Still in the game on the charts while all of your artists get dropped
Niggas hate, bitches jealous, Turned my knuckles into something gross, disgusting
OG puffin, too good stuff, got me buzzin, keep that new new Lauren London
Juicy J still winning still spending big or small face hunnids
In the vip with my guys bitches be hypnotized cool running
You know I’m a boss and I can put you on (x2)
Got a golf course in my backyard and I don’t play golf
Sipping Henny by the ocean smoking just like the exhaust
Hopped out, coupe running, goons on deck bout to shoot something
Fuck nigga do something, marathon clips got ya crew running
Rick James, super freak, first date, met ya bitch, dove deep
OD, won’t see, a day without racks on me
