You either stacking or you hating, nigga
Been serving niggas, but im never waiting on a nigga
If you want it, then you gotta go and take it, nigga
Kick down doors, rush a crib like the swat, nigga
I feel like I can't sleep until I get a thousand G's
If I can't get it clean, like a janitor, I need a hunnid Ki's
For the fam, im down to do anything just to let them eat
If you ain't on the same, then prioritize yo priorities
Bitch nigga, stop lacefrontin, lay low with the drama
Fuck the bullshit, common sense told me, get the commas
Niggas want the shit that you work for, when they unemployed
If you ain't putting in work, then nigga what the fuck you doing?
Well, me. Im ballin. Fuck the talking, nigga, we can solve it
Resolve it, riding like a spur with that 9, nigga Tony Parker
And, you dont want me Tim Duncan in yo bitch
You gone play Ginobli part, leave you sitting on that bench
Bench press the game, man this shit slightwork
Man, these niggas weak in the paint like Durk
Couple bars, rest in peace, put it on a shirt
If you coming at my fam, you gotta put me in the dirt
