[Intro]
They don’t respect humble, all people see is the shine
So I designed lines illuminating their mind
Greatest amount of time, they tell you different, they lied
Been around the world, the poster boy of CI
Let ‘em know

[Hook]
They ask if I be getting it, I had to let ‘em know
They ask about who spitting it, I had to let ‘em know
They ask who really living it, I had to let ‘em know
(Oh you ain’t know?), oh you ain’t know?
(oh you ain’t know?), I let ‘em know

[Verse 1]
What we talking ‘bout, anybody you think’s somebody, I better chalk ‘em out
Slow drag ‘em and walk ‘em out
Cold world when the hawk is out, better bundle up
Turn whoever running it to runner up, run 'em up, what
I been on my shit since the beginning
I never played the sideline, worried about who winning
The bottom of the ninth, you win it then close the inning
As long as it’s pen then we fitting to win the pennant
Sentences been intended since written it be a mess
Never need an adlib from Khaled to be the best
Pockets is BMF, rolling in the BM with this BM
When she see ‘em, she holler and PMS
Never guess, let ‘em know

[Hook]
They ask if I be getting it, I had to let ‘em know
They ask about who spitting it, I had to let ‘em know
They ask who really living it, I had to let ‘em know
(Oh you ain’t know?), oh you ain’t know?
(oh you ain’t know?), I let ‘em know

[Verse 2]
What you think this is? I ain’t really ‘bout it?
I ain’t did it or lived it ‘cause I ain’t shout it?
Think I’m pussy, I doubt it, think of playing us, I’m on the roof
I get as naughty as Treach, my problems often is mook
My alibi is the booth, only body I got
You wonder why I’m winning, I’m grinning wondering why not?
Shit is clear as an eyedrop, every record I drop
That’s hip-hop, and your shit suck, get off my dick top
Call ‘em reezy fo’ sheezy, my spitting make it look easy
Your breezy told me she need me, she on the camera, no TV
I’ll motivate her like Jeezy, illest with the flow
Entitled to hold the title, whoever want it for sho’
Let em’ know

[Hook]
They ask if I be getting it, I had to let ‘em know
They ask about who spitting it, I had to let ‘em know
They ask who really living it, I had to let ‘em know
(Oh you ain’t know?), oh you ain’t know?
(oh you ain’t know?), I let ‘em know

[Verse 3]
What you know about going to the European tour
We travel around the world, seeing more, let ‘em know
What you know about getting to them racks, to them stacks
Getting out of the hood but giving back, let ‘em know
What you know about going on a nationwide tour
We travel around the world, seeing more
What you know about getting to them racks, to them stacks
Getting out of the hood but giving back, let ‘em know

[Hook]
