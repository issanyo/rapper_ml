[Verse: Vee Tha Rula]
Get money, I'm a dog for it
Cause I swear I wasn't born with it
Don't act like this shit from a song nigga
I been grinding for a long minute
Blunt long looking like an arm and
And it's still with the fire in a storm and I'm going to hit it
Dealing with these rappers for too long, they the wrong niggas
Even when I'm on I swear that I won't do a song with 'em
Tattoos and some more wounds, boy get 'em
And I hug and kiss that pussy, I adore women
You like a snotty nosed kid, you annoy women
I pop a bottle, smoke a cone, and enjoy women
You little niggas know what the deal
I'm outwitting the devil like Napoleon Hill
Go go super Sayen three like I'm Broly and Bills
Real shit, all the real niggas know what it is, yeah
Niggas tripping, get to tipping like they dominoes
Every time they see the first sign of hoes
Rula the type to chill with all kind of hoes
Cannon ball in that pussy like Geronimo
Like flocka busting at them with a choppa
Taking shots of that Ciroc
Tomorrow I'm a need a doctor
Rula [?] just a saga
Nappy hair I look like Blanca
I be beasting, I'm a monster
I be eating shrimp and lobster

[Hook: Vee Tha Rula]
You get it, I'll go there
They see me, like whoa there
Won't slow down, won't hold up, I plant this and grow there
Grind hard for so long, don't like me, I don't care
They want beef, it's so rare but...

Get 'em boy, Rula kill em all
Fucking bitches in the car, I'm like Billy Bob
Nigga I'm a star, you see me from far
Master kush in my cone cause a nigga raw
Now I'm scoped, just spit that crack like I been smoking
I be chilling [?]
But I'm on fire, y'all is toast
Keep it real like I'm supposed to
Eat your clit like ponderosa
If you fuck with me they stabbing at your back like Omarosa
For real, I'm bout the fucking dollar bills
She bought some thousand dollar heels
Can't be a dog without a meal
You know the feeling when you feel like you the one
That's why I'm taking number twos on just about every beat that come
I say I'm walking like I'm Deebo
Rapping like a hero
Smoking on illegal
Be more looking like a kilo
Can you feel the heat though?
'97 nigga [?]
I'm just hot and you on zero
And that green I get for Ceelo
Fly fly boy, get your sky on
Hyenas always tripping on the lions
Got some, smoking papers on Mount Zion
You fucking with my shit, your chance is thinner than a fly on
I know niggas rather the pen and the pad
That's why I'm trying to get my paper right, pen and the pad
On the beat I'm like a scientist, I been in the lab
And now they riding my wave and the feeling is rad

[Hook: Vee Tha Rula]
You get it, I'll go there
They see me, like whoa there
Won't slow down, won't hold up, I plant this and grow there
Grind hard for so long, don't like me, I don't care
They want beef, it's so rare but...
