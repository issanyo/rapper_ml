[Verse]
I'm pretty god damn rando
I'm the real God-Father so they call me Marlon Brando
I got a Nissan, no Lambo
Talk shit if you want to catch the hands though
Man I can go from Rocky to Rambo
Then to Dredd that's kind of rando
See me in the streets I'm going commando
No pants either, king of the rando
Love good weather, so I move to Orlando
I love the beach, but I hate the sand though
I've mastered the technique of rando
So when I'm asked how far my car can go?
I answer with a simple I don't know
In a second I can go zero to ocho
I learned a little spanish from my friend Fernando
He also taught me to tango
And when he pulls out the AK he never runs out of ammo
Is that pretty rando?
We have a band named Blue Mango
He plays piano I play banjo
We Drive-By shooting in his Dodge Durango
We are the most rando
We have concerts pulling in mad fans bro
They're all 13 year old girls, not that rando
