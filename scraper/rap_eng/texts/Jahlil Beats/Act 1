[Verse 1: Sleazee]
My iPhone white and my fit too
I be getting high blowing smoke like a pistol
No hoop dreams tryna ball like a piston
Fake niggas tryna blow up with me I went missing
Hating ass niggas man I peep em from a distance
Only fluke niggas tend to fallout like a loose tooth
Know some crazy niggas think they gotta couple screws loose Niggas talk crazy grab the tool knock yo screws loose
Niggas always scopin tryna peep what I'm up to
Swear they tryna get a lil scoop like a news crew
I'm that nigga with a plan and you can't get a blues clue
So sit back relax and watch a nigga like this YouTube
What do you do you, not getting money
Aww boohoo tryna move the bag but yo weed ass like Doo Doo Doing magic no voodoo try to step to me, know I'm jimmy two shoes
I'm in The booth going coocoo train on the track hear the choo choo

[Verse 2: 4G]
Silver chances on this hoes love it though
Wolverine cloves that mean I'm cut throat
A.C.T niggas  that mean I got flow
I can't really help it I really got doe
I'm really getting tired lets just state the facts
I could been had yo bitch if I wanted that
I just fuck let just run the check
Unlimited flow I really got that
What the fuck is limit if I surpass
Ot ot  nigga back to back
Niggas said fuck it let just kill the track
It don't take skills I'm just stating fact
They say I got the steaz when it come to dab
They say George don't do it when it come to that
My ex bitch had problems so I move on to the next
I just tuck the ball and secure the sack
Damn
A.C.T we on the map
They try to bit are style but we ain't having that
One dimensional but we ain't spitting that
The shit that I'm saying it's addictive like crack
Mr miagy flow
Haters mad I already know
I can't even help it tho
Yo hoe love us tho
You can have her bro
We took her just as a joke
She gave up throat and my niggas already know

[Verse 3: Dynamic]
Dr strange with the verses causing curses
Penmanship is golden all you niggas worthless
Tron with the coding like Cindy Morgan
Conan with the bat bout to hit the function
Flood the tokens chase the money I am golden
Bitch I go in constant flowing no controlling
A beast to tame know the name flood the game
I beat the case record break we insane yeah
Drop bombs like a super nova
Barry bonds home run bitch I'm running over
Niggas trying rope me in like a toga
I make amends with a goddess
Hold up bih I'm switching topics
A crack in the matrix like reaganomics
Yeah we bout to bomb atomic
With the flow I'm not novice
Omnipotent causing havoc
Mobbing deep no pun intended
Niggas trying copy me but ain't got a template
You might as well just a cop a plea it's young dynamic
A raging storm like a tempest
He play the horns and I grab em neck and play the menace
You grab the tech I snatch your necklace
And go ghost like Danny phantom on another planet
Can't even plan it creating my canvas
Shout out Johnny cause we going deep
Late night on the creep Two Te come kill this beat

[Verse 4: Two Te]
I eat the beat like Hanible they tell me don't do it Two Te you too radical
Iron fist flow so you know it's tyrannical
It doesn't matter hoe
A C T you know who we are
Hoes break they necks when we step out of the car
Dark knight flow so you know it's insane hit em with the back breaker you would think I was bane
Do it for the love so I'm screaming fuck the fame
Hit em with the lotus style might even do the crane
I'm insane in the membrane analytical so you know I'm going left brain
You should be ashamed
Tryna jack my style nigga please stay in your lane
ACT that's my crew you know what it do
Shmoney dance on these haters cause you know my hundreds blue
Please find Steve cause you niggas need to get a clue
