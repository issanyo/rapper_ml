[Hook: Meek Mill]
Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
And I keep a dime chick like 5 times 2
I like my Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
Plus I keep a dime chick

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ay, Rose sipper, wrist all glitter
Not to mention ya'll niggas on twitter
Swag on Louie, neck on shimmer
Cool ball head like a boot-camp skimmer
And I'm ballin' like never before
My bitch super bad she can never be yours
No sir, walkin' in with a Glock 17 on
You fuckin' with the real like karate kings
We in club livin where trippin is big business
If we messin' 'round Rozay it's bottles without a limit
Got they bar if they can catch me or take me like it was in it
That new Panamere tinted can't see who in it
Wiz at the club tryin to teach me how to dougie
Took her to the crib she told me teach me how to suck it
She cheated one for me cause she know I get that money
I don't know what that bitch thinkin', she can't get a Dolla from me

[Hook: Meek Mill]
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Rose red, bread I just throw away
On a love boat gettin head from a stow away
T.I.P. OG I do it big, you do it lowercase
I get hit with a O of Yay, my lawyer make it go away
Aye, aye shit they catch me out in Philly
On Suzuki's poppin' wheelies with my nigga Meek Milly
I’m really as fly as I say, come see
Other guys run G, I’d rather run deep
We still ridin' dirty like my nigga Bun-B
Kick it old school, street fighter, Chun Li
A young G who do it in the memory of Pimp C
My diamond ring light blue, champagne light pink

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
And I keep a dime chick like 5 times 2
I like my Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
Plus I keep a dime chick

[Verse 3: Vado]
Apartment on the north bend
Cigar lit, sleeves up, Audemar tick
My broad thick, house wife, tony park chick
I'm from that park bitch, paul K, dark shifts
Glowin the dark wrists, that’s a night light
What’s ya life like?
Mines move that white white
Got it for the right price, they say i'm type nice
Im feelin tight nice, credit card swipe swipe
Sweater Gauss not tight, nah, ya’ll love it
Whole team, Tsunami the club, my song flood it
Rose, Haze to the brain my mind cluded
First deal i'm wantin' the same as Sean’s budget

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
R-R-Rose red and my diamonds blue
Plus I keep a dime chick like 5 times 2
I like my Rose
Ro-Ro-Ro-Rose, Ro-Ro-Ro-Rose
Ro-Ro-Ro-Rose, Ro-Ro-Ro-Rose
Ro-Ro-Ro-Rose, Ro-Ro-Ro-Rose

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Valet cars, roll up jars
He bought his girls ain't nothin' like ours
Ass is fat, hair is dead
Blew that back out now she wanna marry the kid
Rose rojo, diamonds blanco
I get my Yayo always pronto
Mula loco, papi gordo
Europe zero, no dinero
