[Intro]
I think it's time, for me to give them a piece of my mind

[Verse]
It's funny how everybody thinks they know me
Didn't talk to me in highschool, now you want to get to know me?
Well, I guess that's cool
But most people from my school are either stuck up bitches or dudes acting like fucking tools
I'll take a hater, make him grab on my rope
Tell him “I'll take him to the top, just put that rope around your throat”
Then when we get up there
I'll dangle him from the stairs
His dumbass still be like
"What the fuck is going on here?"
Many don't want to get me started
To the people I hurt, I'm sorry
I really hope that I can still come to your pitty party
Nobody's safe, so everybody duck for cover
I don't really give a fuck, but that's just cause I got no rubber
I Must Be A Fucking Asshole With This Shit Coming
Out Of My Mouth
Fuck With Me, You Might Come Home To A Guy With
A Clown Ass On Your Couch
I'm Just Kidding, Maybe Not
I'm The Shit I'm Raving Hot
And I'm So Horny, But I Got No Lube, So I'll Just Use
Some Applesauce
Hate Me All You Want, But Talent man you know I have it
I'm Like The White Lil' Wayne Mixed With A Bit Of
Bob Saget
Huh That's What People Say I'll Jump On A Boat And
Sail Away
And Now I'm On An Island Where They're Sharks
And All The Skies Are Gray
I'm Just So Tired Of These Dumb Ass Bitches, They
Come Home, The Dad At Work And The Mom In The
Kitchen
Log On To Facebook, Putting Up A Status They
Bitching About How Much They Hate Their Lives
When Their Families The Richest
How Many Problems Do You Really Think That You
Have?
Your Biggest Last Week Was Whether You Should
Buy A New Cat
Now spit it homie Move Back
Enough Balls To Fill Two Sacks
And They Say “You're A Rapper? When You Gonna
Get A New Tat?”
Well, Why You Try To Put Me Into A Box?
They Say I'm Acting Crazy, Just Haven't Been
Sleeping Alot
Now All My Dreams Turn To Nightmares, Where I
Only Have Five Hairs
And Pull Em' Out, Listening To A Dumb Bitch And A
Tight Pair
The Way These Girls Act, Man It Makes Me Sick
They're Starving Always Searching For Attention
And Shit
And When You're Going To Work Girl, Don't Upload A
Pic
And When You're Brushing Your Teeth Girl, Don't
Upload A Pic!
Shit!
Nobody Really Cares That Much About Your Life
I'm Sorry, I'd Rather Watch A Fly Eating Pie, Than To
Look At Pictures From Every Second Of Your Life
It's Like My Newsfeed Is A Pool, And Your Trying To
Drown My Eyes
People Always Hate, So I Ask Them What They Don't
Like
They Say,“I Haven't Listened To You, But I Heard
You're Alright, But If I Listened Is just Probably
Something I Wouldn't Like.”
And I'm Just Like,“Shut Up Slut, You're A Drunk Mess
Right?”
You Really Are A Hoe And Girl You Can't Deny It
Cause I Just Over Heard You Talking Bout' A Dirty
Pirate And How You Swore It How You Still Have It
Under Your Eye Lid
And How The Guy Was Big And Hairy And His Name
Was Tidus
Hating On Other Rappers, Yeah That Ain't Me
So Many People Talk About No Way Hes Better
Than Me
But When Yo' Albums Both Dropped, He Sold Tons
Of Cd's And Then You?
You Sold None, How Are You Better Than He Is?
See, Promote Yourself
That's All Part Of The Game
You Say You Have Killa' Lyrics, But Yo' Songs Aren't
Playin'
And Then You Blame It On The Fact That He Gets
Radio Play?
Stop Whining And All Just Grind Or Get Out Of The
Game
I Have To Admit, I Do Talk Myself Over Bit
But, That's Only Because I Know One Day I'll Actually
Live It
Mazer With It, Always Going Cause There Ain't No
Finish, So If You Trynna Stop Me, You Better Become
A Winner
Now, Love How People Talking Shit Are The Ones
That Have No Potential And All Of Them Will Copy
Me With A Lyrical Pencil
Fuck It
I'll Be Happy If You Wanna Be Me, I Mean I Am A
Cool Rapper Working Towards A Degree. Gee
I'm Kinda Flattered, My Heart Is Going “Pitter-Patter”
Thinking Bout' Going To College Just To Become A
Rapper
I'll Do Whatever, Who Cares What I Do?
So I Sit In The Back Of Class Writing Raps Cause
They Good
This Girl Was Like,“ Hey Mark, Or Should I Call You
Witty? I Heard That You're A Rapper, Do You Record
In The City? And Aren't You From The Suburbs? I
Bet Your Music Is Shitty. Cause I Know Tons Of Other
Rappers And They All Film Pretty. You're Probably
Just Another Freck Rapper Trying To Get Big. Well, I
Know Rappers From The City That Sounds Better
Than Big. I Haven't Heard Them, But That's What
They Tell Me And Shit. Good Luck On Your Career, I
Hope I Wasn't Being A Bitch!”
First Off, Um
Never Fucking Label Me!
And Girl You're So Fake I Thought That You Were
Fucking Make-Believe!
Save Your Luck Full Of B When It's Only 8 Degrees
I Don't Really Care If Some Dumb Bitch Wants To
Hate On Me
What Else Is On My Mind?
I Think I'm Running Out Of Time
I'm Already Four Pages Deep Inside My Little Book
Of Rhymes
Hold On!
I See The Finish Line
But, I Still have A Little Time
To Fat Right Lines And Show You All I Can Fucking
Rhyme. Yeah
You Wanna Talk Behind My Back?
I Hope You Like The View Back There
You Should Be Kissing My Ass
I Rappin' Slow, I Rappin' Fast, I Do It New
And Fuck The Past
And I'm Schooling Anyone That Isn't Going To
Class
Bitch
