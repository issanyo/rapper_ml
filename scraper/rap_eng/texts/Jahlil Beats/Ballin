[Intro – Meek Mill]
It’s the dream team bitch
Mr. Philadelphia
Philly in this bitch, Meek Million

[Verse 1 – Meek Mill]
All I ever wanted was a million and a bad bitch
Used to blow my money and wake up like where my stacks went
I was  17 I left my crib, went where the cash went
And popped back in my hood in an Aston, mansion
Flying with the top off, and I’m getting topped off
I’m about my chicken bitch, and I spit that hot sauce
Mustard yellow Breitling, tell 'em catch up, I’m a hot dog
Hood nigga, but I live my life like I’m a rock star
Shot bar, fuck no, take me where the bottles at
Mr. Rose baby, get a lot of that
Copy that, roger that, I be where it’s popping at
Jahlil he put a hit out on that beat I b-b-body that
Imma take the offshore, baby, cause it costs more
Elevator take me to the top, right on the ball floor
Shawty tried to jump inside the coupe, can’t find the car door
Why you think I work so much and grind so fucking hard for

[Hook – Meek Mill]
Hey, bottles up, shawty drop me down
Ask who fucking with me, not a sound
Hear them haters talking, but they whispering
So what they saying bout me, cause I’m getting it
We ballin, we ballin
Ballin like it’s Spalding
Everytime I wake up all I hear is money calling
Ballin and ballin, tearing up the Martin
Call me Mr. wrecking ball the way I break them walls in

[Verse 2 – Shizz Nitty]
Fuck niggas and bitches
Ain’t Shizzy a dope
Used to have weed, now they say the bottom got dope
Knew a nigga had soap, and they rocked his ass
Saw they did a round hit, and they stopped his ass
Million dollar nigga, they call him socks in the air
They don’t play around anigga, they got Glocks over there
Rest in peace to Lil [?], he was just in the way
When them bullets from up top, man they started to spray
It’s just another story from around the way
Where we keep a tough crew and them boys don’t play
75 nigga ball, rest in peace to bubble
I like my remmy and my rose, bud is [?]
Keep winning, and keep on losing
You keep on hating and your bitch keep choosing
You think she ain’t?
Motherfucker we got bottles sitting everywhere
Ain’t too many niggas models sitting everywhere

[Hook]
