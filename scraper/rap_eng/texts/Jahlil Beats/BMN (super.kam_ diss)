[Intro]
Back with another one dickhead
It's Mo $leezy
Yo this goes out to all the Bitch Made Niggas out there
Especially one who goes by the name of Super Kam
He’s the OG Bitch Made Nigga
This makes 3 L’s that I handed out this year
Y’all not fuckin with me
LET’S GET IT

[Verse]
You shouldn’t have taken the first shot you god damn nigher
I’ll show you how a real redneck squeezes the trigger
I knew I had to expose this nigga once my career started
Jumped out the crib that bitch he knew he was a target
Nappy headed nigga yea we already know that
Tryna get knots to impress ya idol Kodak
Half White hogging all the crack, pass the blow back
Still got that chubby side, that’s why you never do track
Bro thinks he’s the shit, we’ll call that man Patch
Bitch Made Nigga, ain’t no games I’m finna play though
You was that nigga on the block who got caught sniffin’ Playdoh
I hope you get home, no shoes on and land on some Legos
This battle’s over, I’ll Chokeslam you like Kane did to Big Show
You know you shouldn’t be talkin shit to ya dad
Dirty as hell, I’ll wipe you clean like a Brillo Pad
Running through the halls, chasin’ Sasuke, Nigga this ain’t Naruto
Ya not on my level, I got that Johnny Tsunami Flow
Knew you was a simp bitch when I heard you sing Hotline
Poodle against a Rot, I’ll show you a real canine
Dickridin ass nigga, I started off with the skits
I should start sellin some do-it-yourself kits
Be honest have you taken a good look at yaself in the mirror?
Ya nose on some shit, fatter than Master Splinter
I’m the real clown, you can call me Heath Ledger
You just a unfunny lil nigga, they call you Adam Sandler
Since you talkin civil activists, I’ll H. Rapp Brown ya shit
Nat Turner wit the burner, pipe down before I crack my whip
Martin Luther ain't die for this, he sufferin’ on his death bed
Well shit, make some room cuz Kam’s body was found shedding red
You never had a crown, King $leezy, this shit I reign
Tried to be on the step team, nigga you a lame
You don’t know shit about me homie so don’t even try it
Talkin bout Pokemon but you stuck on Dora, you can’t deny it
I rep Philly over anything, Day 1 till I die
I’ll sock yo shit, leave ya eye shut lookin like Popeye
Career flopping more than the Warriors in the Finals
You and Romo should be twins, cuz soon as I finish ya back is broken, Spinal

[Outro]
Now that's how you do a warning shot nigga
Learn from your father
You the type of nigga to play dead when ya homies gettin jumped
Ol' Bitch Made Nigga
Matter of fact, gimme all ya followers nigga
Im done witchu
Aye
You don't want know problems, want no problems wit me
I said You don't want know problems, want no problems wit me
Mo $leezy (DRG)
