I gotta be the hardest hustling nigga, that never touched a block.
I lied, cause everything I spit up dope like I swallowed a roc
Check the kicks that I cop. Check the checks that I rock
Niggas Hope I'm Solo, but I never was the goalie type
I got my niggas, they tote them triggers, they fingers itching.
They passed english, meaning they a do a whole sentence.
Whatever you got in mind, I suggest you dont try
Cause once you step too far we gone catch you slippin like that bowling line
Back to stunting, its really nothing, you niggas bluffing
Yo bitch see it, I swear I didn't mean to take yo women
I dick her down, I kick her out, seem like I'm punting
You can have her back, no recite, Im refunding
Yall rerunning, yall niggas on that same shit
I'm Nick Young'in, cause I like to switch up my kicks.
The wise said, the truth must come to the light
How fitting, cause I been grinding now its time to shine.
