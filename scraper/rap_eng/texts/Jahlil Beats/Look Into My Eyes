[Hook: N.O.R.E]
Look into the eyes of a real nigga
Tell me you can feel what I feel nigga
Tell me you can see what I see boy
Walk with me, tell me you can be where I be

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E]
Yea, I'm still here, eatin on that bon jon
N.O.R.E child in Givon, Japan, Hong Kong
Buckets and sand models, I prefer the cherry weed
Accustomed to going through customs every week
Passports stamped up like it's camouflage
Bitches chase arrigo, turtle shit, entourage
Bitches on my dick, they wanna sabotage
Fuck em and I get down with em, that's m√©nage
Nice and charged, black mack, black garage
Shoot you in yo crib, fucked yo girl nigga, bon voyage
Mackin charge, fuck it we can settle shit
Hit you with some metal shit, your face look pregnant
They call me OG, they respect it
If not, them niggas won't be leavin with they necklace
Niggas act reckless, leave them niggas breathless
Shoot em up for lunch dinner, brunch or breakfast

[Hook: N.O.R.E]
Look into the eyes of a real nigga
Tell me you can feel what I feel nigga
Tell me you can see what I see boy
Walk with me, tell me you can be where I be
Look into the eyes of a real nigga
Tell me you can feel what I feel nigga
Tell me you can see what I see boy
Walk with me, tell me you can be where I be

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E]
Yea, so you can see it in my eyes
You could tell from my hands, from the cuts, from the plies
That I'm a nigga that's extraordinary
Fuck er on the first night, nigga that's ordinary
Niggas in the Luxor, chillin by the pyramids
Thinkin I'm Egyptian, that feel is serious
Besides I got a home, chillin in my summer home
Yea that's just my brother at home, shoot you what yo mother on
I'mma still be rich, you can suck a dick
Hater shit, hater shit, niggas on that sucka shit
Yea I'm still here, still getting it
Stopped selling drugs, cause my mouth started spittin it
This rap shit, you gotta love that
Million niggas jobs on parole, you gotta love that
Never gotta ask me where the bud at
Be loyal nigga, show me where the love at

[Hook: N.O.R.E.]
Look into the eyes of a real nigga
Tell me you can feel what I feel nigga
Tell me you can see what I see boy
Walk with me, tell me you can be where I be
Look into the eyes of a real nigga
Tell me you can feel what I feel nigga
Tell me you can see what I see boy
Walk with me, tell me you can be where I be
