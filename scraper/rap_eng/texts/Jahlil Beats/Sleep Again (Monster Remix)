[Verse 1: Manzy]

Climb the ladder to success, I'm in beast mode
You ain't got much left, you pussies need to reload
Pop one, pop two, "I ask do we need mo'?"
Third time's a charm so I hit it like a free throw
Hit the lab lyrically I'm a real artist
Grab a chair, take a seat, I'm about to get started
Can't even speak, just about to word it
Ain't ever gonna quit because in the end it'll be worth it
(Ha)
You know I gotta shout 'em out
My homies in the Pearl still killing shit without a doubt
And them bills, you know I gotta count 'em out
Cause shakin' on the streets, man, that is what I'm all about
And yeah I'm still an athlete, I'm in the back streets
Cop a band, runnin' circles like a track meet
Bust one off and these fuckers gonna drop
And I ain't gonna stop 'til I reach the fuckin' top
And I'm gone
Back again with fire dog, hanging off the wire hot like a fire log
Pull the fire long then we run for our lives
For disguise I cop a mask from Sears Catalog

[Hook 1: Manzy]

Hell yeah, I hear 'em creeping in
Love rap so much don't wanna speak again
My brain's just a place you can't comprehend
I just want it all to stop so I can sleep again
Hell yeah, I hear them creeping in
Love rap so much don't wanna speak again
My brain's just a place you can't comprehend
I just want it all to stop so I can sleep again

[Verse 2: Manzy]

My flow is so aggressive, style so impressive, you know I'm the best of
All of these rappers that I made successive
Wake up with the dollar bill on the dresser
Got my homies to the side
Right hand man, Zach Hen 'til I die
But he ain't the only one I gotta shout to
Y'all listening I wouldn't be here without you
And the homies this one is all about you
Young Canadian but I'm tryin' to get out dude
But I rep the red and white until I'm overdue
Like a library book I purchased in fuckin' June
Rollin' up like a Rolling Stone
But the rest of these sessions is steps so call it stepping stones
I was writin' and typin', before I got high
Now I sit back and wonder what I'm doing
Still pursuin' these rhymes, take it back to the time
Where I looked at my mom, then I looked up at God
Asked him one more chance not to be trapped inside
And only in reality I was trapped in my mind

[Outro: Manzy]

Hell yeah, you know I hear him scream
Young with flow, yo, I'm only seventeen
This my first ever single, yeah you heard of me
M to the A to the N to the Z
(Ha)
