Drugs for the low got your love on the pole
Them Guns gonna come them slugs gonna blow
Run in your home with a gun to your dome
Cause we're Young and we're dumb give a fuck where to go
Rap unstable The Black Kurt angle
Breakin your ankles and breakin your tables
Give too fucks if they scream you suck
Give no they kids two blunts and they bitch two nuts
Light skin Kane spotlights get drained
Stop lifes with flames every time I'm in rang
Comin down like a hardy I ain't gonna be restrained
Young HBK sweet music to your brain
In this shit like the game Triple H be the name
Leave you knocked out cold like H in your vains
95 DX bitches flashin they breast
Leave you like the undertaker in a casket to rest
