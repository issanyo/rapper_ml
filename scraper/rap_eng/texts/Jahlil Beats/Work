[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Niggas playing Pac-man, chasing power pennies
I'm playing Call of Duty with that Mac-11
It's death before dishonor, I'll shoot the reverend
And if he go against the team his ass gon be hell or heaven
Lord, forgive me for my sins, I'm just trying to get a Benz
In the kitchen with the pyrex, last brick, I gotta make it stretch
Spread your wings, let me see you fly
Can you bring a nigga back twenty five?
Rubber band that, shit still wet, double fan that

[Chorus]
Work, where it's at?
Work, quit saying that
Work, what your mans at?
Work, thousand grand man
Work, where it's at?
Work, quit saying that
Work, what your mans at?
Work, thousand grand man

[Verse 2: French Montana]
God, forgive me for my sins
I fucked the game, tryna make twins
Broke a brick down, tryna to buy a Benz
Diamonds all black, caught a ticket for them tens
Bought a big house with a fence
And had to pay taxes for them M's
I paid houses off in Magic City
I pay cars off in Sin City
Slidin' with a model, drinking out the bottle
She don't like drinkin' but, shorty love to swallow
30 on the Rolly, gripping on the 40
Fifty on the molly, spend sixty in the party

[Chorus]
Work, where it's at ?
Work, quit saying that
Work, where your mans at?
Work, thousand grand man
Work, where it's at?
Work, quit saying that
Work, where your mans at?
Work, thousand grand man

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Dope boy shit, boy I'm turnt up
I'll pass on that ho, boy she burnt up?
You niggas fighting over ho's, you kidding me
So you think that bitch belong to you? You shitting me
Fly shit, real nigga, we talk eye-to-eye shit
This whip, that chain, these watches, my shit
Gold chain and Versace, black 3-80 and it's popping
Standing on the couches with my head calling
I'm in this bitch acting like it's my spot
Lights on us, primetime, you know it's Brick-R-Us, grind time

[Chorus]
Work, where it's at?
Work, quit saying that
Work, where your mans at?
Work, thousand grand man
Work, where it's at?
Work, quit saying that
Work, where your mans at?
Work, thousand grand man
