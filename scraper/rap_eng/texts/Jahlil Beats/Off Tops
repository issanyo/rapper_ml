What's that? A mother fuckin sign?
Driving solo dolo females want to join my line
Instead I just declined
Cause I'm a good fellow smoking hookah sticks Im in New york in my Carmelo
Fool me once Dido
Fool me twice my bad though
I'm only 16 but my flow is so professional
King me twice like chess heads
No diss tracks I stay in tech
I see the money as eye candy I make it flip like tech decks
They ridin round giving pity
My eye lids on twitch mode the spidy sense is tingling i see it as negativity
I always stay humble
I always stay in tack
That's why I roll around in the game boy with the city on my back
Now I make it wet like I'm diving
Standing tall no Giant
I beat the beat no rhyming
My Music loud no nodding
Watch me do it big, hard working
Get so famous now they lurking
I'm like nah bitch you trippin
Come for the money yall so ignorant
I was on yo shit now I'm off yo shit
Now you on my shit you trippin
Bitch I ball hard now Kobe mad, that i make it rain, no swishers
Whats that? Purp
I drink that first then
Push them lines I ain't listing
All the liquor get you drunk
Mix that punch with Sonny Liston
Now Im loco bitch no chicken
Thats an icy wrist no treatment
Niggas act like they got one bitch
Reality times by 6
What's that nigga?
A pimp nigga
6 times 10 with the S on the end we slaves nigga
Big Tony hawking them lil niggas
He a flip nigga
