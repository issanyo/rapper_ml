[Pre-Hook]
Pull up to the club and I drop my top up
All this money on me, man, you know a nigga floss
And I fucked your bitch, nutted on her lip gloss
MMG shit, you can call me Rick Ross

[Hook]
I feel like I'm Rick Ross
I feel like I'm Rick Ross
I feel like I'm Rick Ross
I feel like I'm Rick Ross

[Verse 1]
I'm in Wingstop, I'm goin' crazy
I'm in Wingstop and I feel like I'm Rozay
I've been gettin' money every week and every day
I been swagged up like my clique is MMG
I got twenty pounds and it's in the backseat
Try King Soulja, have you runnin' like track meet
Money on deck, you know this is MMG
I feel like Rozay when I'm in the VIP

[Verse 2]
Yeah nigga money everywhere
MMG shit, bottles up in the air
We be throwin' money all up in the air
We be shootin' pistols at you niggas, you shoot in the air
I signed Meek Mill, I signed Omarion
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like I'm the one
I feel like Rozay and my hoes gay
In my old-school, goin' 'bout three-thirty-eight
