[Intro: French Montana]
Throw something up fools
It’s all about the money
You gotta know this
Word

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Probly backin' up at motorway
Old hoopty but we just put the motor in
This the whip, that niggas yelling YOLO in
Gun under my arm like it’s deodorant
Bullet ‘bout as big as a can they put a soda in
End up in the trunk of a car that got odar in it [EW]
I don’t sip the liquor, I take a gulp
Fuckin’ with a nigga, that’s strong enough to face the hulk
44 long cuz Shorty was all wrong
Thought he was thugged out, now his face is all wrong
I don’t care about their fam, I’ll make them all mourn
There were Biggie and Sean Combs was taking broads home
On the phone with the chick. Crystal bitches bitches
And ace hoes, it’s money in my name like Ma$e though
Body broad daylight, nigga no case though
Fuck the funny money niggas, I get straight dough

[Hook: French Montana]
Niggas talkin’ like they got something for me
Nigga, you and what army? Dawg
Niggas grippin’ over here
Hit you with a hundred then I blow it in the air

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Got a line of some dope from this bitch named Tammy
Tammy’s from Miami, round all the nose Candy
Bronze tanned on her like I’m walking with the Grammy
Ex nigga popped, he flopped and turned Sammy
I ain’t for the bull
Sign of a setup then a trigger’s getting pulled
Thinkin’ that it’s thriller when my nigga turned wolves
Do as Simon says like the ’95 Suge
All red on, death row chain
MGM fight night, Orlando was to blame
Outcome was the same
Dead on arrival, death to my rivals
Empty out the clips, spin a nigga like a spiral
YUGK, that’s the stairway to heaven nigga
On my big shit, waitin’ on the seven nigga
Order cocaine white like a wedding nigga woo
The king’s stuntin’ on these peasant niggas
Push

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
It’s like ring around the Rosé
Hand on the bottle, sit back and get coz-ay
Still killin’ that white bitch, OJ
Knocking 'Homecoming' from Kanye and Coldplay
It was me and Jose in the hallway
House full of dope with the pump by the doorway
True story, niggas'll shoot for me
But I ride out, you heard more than a few stories
I wild out, throw you off of a 2-story
Nigga, just to break your leg
Your connect got the work, nigga tryna break an egg
Yea, so hurry up and get it poached
Get the feds give ya life when you’re fuckin’ with the dope
Catch me in LA fucking with the smoke
Or maybe in San Fran
With an OG nigga that used to get it on Pan-Am
What?

[Hook]
