[Intro: Casanova]
Yo Mike, put that camera down, don't record this
Look them niggas drivin' down the block
[?] you got it? You know how we move
Yo, how you lookin' Fresh? On deck
[?] you better have your shit, you know I got it
[?] walk me to the car, aight, bet

[Hook]
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I swear to God, this ain't what you really want
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I swear to God, this ain't what you really want

[Post-Hook]
Don't tell 'em niggas nothin', let them niggas come (let 'em come)
Don't tell 'em niggas nothin', let them niggas come (let 'em come)
Don't tell 'em niggas nothin', let them niggas come (let 'em come)
I swear to god I got 2 Uzis in the trunk (rah)

[Verse 1]
I keep a Uzi not a small Gat (you know that)
Le-le-leave a nigga brains in a ball cap (bang)
I gotta eat, don't spoil that (gimme that)
I hope you don't tell, I can't afford that (I ain't goin' back)
His phone ringin', he can't call back (can't pick up, nigga)
But I left his body on his doormat
I ring the bell, then I ran off
Shit get spooky, it's a stand off (I ain't scared)
I ain't see a opp, I see his grandma (what's up?)
Like lady what you scared for?
I ain't want you, I want your grandson
And that funeral, you better plan one

[Bridge]
'Cause his money on that boy head (chi-ching)
It won't be funny when that boy dead
'Cause he was fuckin' with them shottas (uh huh)
Like that chopper go blocka-blocka (boo-, boo-, boom!)

[Hook]
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I swear to God, this ain't what you really want
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I swear to God, this ain't what you really want

[Post-Hook]
Don't tell 'em niggas nothin', let them niggas come (let 'em come)
Don't tell 'em niggas nothin', let them niggas come (let 'em come)
Don't tell 'em niggas nothin', let them niggas come (let 'em come)
I swear to god I got 2 Uzis in the trunk (rah)

[Verse 2]
I'm jumpin' over bodies while I'm hatin' niggas (get out' my way, nigga)
Oh, you talk? And that's forbidden, nigga (fuck, you staggin' up)
You a whack, you gotta wear that (you know that)
Start screamin', I don't wanna hear that (I don't wanna hear nothin')
My brother can never get his life back (freedom will)
Even though you went to trial and tried to fight back (fuck them cops)
And crackers told my brother take 25 (we ain't takin' shit)
So pussy, now yo' ass gotta die
Them shells hot, ain't it? (hot)
Feel like a stove when it's hot, don't it? (ooou)
Took out the Uzi, aimed it (uh huh)
Now your blood all on the pavement (boo-, boo-, boom!)

[Bridge]
'Cause his money on that boy head (chi-ching)
It won't be funny when that boy dead
'Cause he was fuckin' with them shottas (uh huh)
Like that chopper go blocka-blocka (boo-, boo-, boom!)

[Hook]
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I swear to God, this ain't what you really want
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I'ma catch a body if I pop the trunk
I swear to God, this ain't what you really want

[Post-Hook]
Don't tell 'em niggas nothin', let them niggas come (let 'em come)
Don't tell 'em niggas nothin', let them niggas come (let 'em come)
Don't tell 'em niggas nothin', let them niggas come (let 'em come)

[Outro]
Niggas know, man
GTO, Mac in the bag, .40 in the holster
You know how we ridin' around, nigga
Falayo, Falayoo
Yeah, rock solid, nigga
Rock steady, nigga
We don't die, we multiply, nigga and come back by 5, nigga
Niggas know how I'm shakin' the buildin'
When I come through, make some room, nigga
Clear it out, nigga make some room
It's a gangster here, nigga make some fuckin' room
Fuck outta here
It's 2X muh'fucker
Strap up
