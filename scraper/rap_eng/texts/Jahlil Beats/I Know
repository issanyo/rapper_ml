[Intro]
Gotta do what I gotta do man
And at this point
It's either me or you
And I be damned if it's gon' be you nigga
Drream
And them two R's ain't for "Rest and Relaxation" either
Mufucka

[Verse 1]
Some think too much of a nigga
Think I'm too much of a nigga
Care to judge but fell to budge
Cause I don't too much give a...
Yea I could take a stand
But that'd be too uncivil
Then the ones that ax
Gon' wanna see my new bucks, timber
Some say you not driven
Spent those few months chilling
It's apparent we all listened
Don't confuse our children
You can't tell em sky's the limit
Nigga you got ceilings
We all sold ourselves short
Need to choose your silver
So me and Freaky out in Vegas
Partying like we made it
500 for a bottle
Burn that money like we make it
Leave the couches for potatoes
Standing all on the railings
Tell the waitress bring shots
Spread em out on the table
If success make niggas hateful
Hate for niggas to see me
I don't need no introduction
My reputation precedes me
Came from nothing not for nothing
Wonder where I got these things
If I told you how I done it
You probably wouldn't believe me naaa

[Hook]
Man these niggas don't like me
But I don't like them neither
If I was like you I wouldn't like me neither
Man these niggas keep scheming
And I'on even know why
But you can keep hating dog
Cause I don't need no one
Got my mind on my money
That's mind over matter
Let em say what they want
I don't mind cause they don't matter
No, No...No, No

[Verse 2]
They think less of a nigga
To try to lessen a nigga
It don't matter unless the matters
More pressing to niggas
Set the mark
Still ain't left no good impression on niggas
If you don't answer to they call
Then they just press end on niggas
Become a legend on niggas
Who tried to map out my moves
Shit it's cool
Hell I'll even leave the map out for you
Put that crap out that they rap bout
I heard all of it too
Took the fair roll
But now I'm fresh up outta my tomb
Millee got me up in Rivi's
Spending til I get dizzy
She don't do this shit too often
That's awesome bitch but oh really?
Fuck it blame it on the rain
...we like Milli Vanilli
Ran through Trojans like this Troy boy prolly tore my achilles
Plenty tense up under pressure
...but I won't fold nigga
...tryna go out on top
Like Anna Nicole nigga
No nigga knows nigga
Not even those niggas
Tired of taking shit for granted
Give me what you owe nigga NOW!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuck what niggas say about him
I ain't worried bout it
Y'all gon' bring the thug outta Seward
Like Red Robin
Pussies follow suit
We rather be led by em
Tell a bitch get your ass in the car
Like Red father
Cause we're riding
Long as dough getting chased
See dead bodies on tracks
Word to Dough, Rick and Trey
Still stuck in my ways
Guess I'm stuck in a way
Cause I don't see no competition
Like it's stuff in way
On the brink of making bank drops
Fuck the niggas who ain't got
Pool of liquor wit my soldiers
Might cannonball out a tank top
At the beach with beach bitches
I just learned how to hang glide
When you see a nigga hung
Don't you call that shit a hate crime
No
And this pace I go
Deserves an accolade
I'm too busy getting rich
Who meddles gon' have to wait
Misery love company
It's comforting when theirs relate
I'll tear the page
Before I'm in the company of Kathy Bates

[Hook]
