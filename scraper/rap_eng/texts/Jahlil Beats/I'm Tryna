[Intro: Meek Mill]
Is you niggas hating cause you mad
Or is you mad cause you hating on me
I don't know
Let's get it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Patron mixed with Nuvo
Got me feeling cool though
[?] in my pockets looking like they sumo
Different color diamonds like we playing Uno
We racing in the Mazi, jumping we jump [?]
Shitting on these haters we don't see them not at all
But if we do happen to see them break they jaws just like they [?]
We break them off we break them all
Catch the slipping make them fall
I'm like Shaq all in the paint I bang on them they too small
I wasted sipping on an Ace
Kissing on the bad bitch she tell me she can taste it
Bout to take her home and hit that [?] like its the Matrix
Tell her she the one and I'll be gone when she awaking
I'm [?], ask me who I mess with I say money
Niggas say they go my bitch but she gon' always come back to me
Ain't that funny (ha ha ha)
Omg MOB Niggas say they fucking with me I just tell them N-O-T
Ain't that funny (ha ha ha)
Omg MOB Niggas say they fucking with me I just tell them N-O-T
Ain't that funny (ha ha ha)
Omg MOB Niggas say they fucking with me I just tell them N-O-T
I'm the hottest in the city bout to take over America
Any bitch you see me with you know I'm probably sharing her
Niggas know I'm on, about to eat like cafeteria
Serious, trying to lock the game like I'm a Terrier

[Hook: Meek Mill]
You tryna sell a brick I'm tryna sell a house
I'm trying to fuck that bitch you trying to buy her out
I'm really on some shit what would I lie about
Get fly you got some Gucci get fly I'm flying out
Switching lanes We be switching planes
When I was trapping I used to get it from what's his name
But now I'm rapping I'm [?] in the game
And I'm balling like I'm Spalding

[Verse 2: Mel Love]
Why they ball the block what they hating for
Why they tell me stop fuck is they waiting for
I ain't like to smoke all I do is double cup
[?]
All I move is butter yo, flooded like New Orleans
Make these haters nauseous wrist wear gorgeous
Haters back up off 'em diamond chain flawless
Sale failed then I just pick it up like a forklift
Champagne bottle pop models watch corporate
[?] on top we on it
I turn nine into a bird and I make it fly
I turn a bird into a Benz and I make it drive
I turned raps into tracks and I made it here
I turn this [?] into a career hope it make me rich
And it make me that and it make me this
Ice all up on my wrist like my shit swollen

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 3: E. Ness]
Take a look at me and you can tell I live the high life
Running with them wolves way before they made Twilight
All I'm really tryna tell these boppers get their mind right
[?] get some haters to hating though in some hindsight
They call me Mr. Lee but never ever did I crime fight
When they come and get [?] this cheese or blind mice
Spit that Walter Cronkite
Fucking all these bitches like its prom night
Flying triple diamond that's what I like
Let's get wasted
So shitfaced to the point that I lost my bird or misplaced it
So high I can bump my head on a spaceship
I can't feel my face no more I need a face lift
Woke up from the Matrix
Slid through the block in the latest
After doing six months out Vegas
All I'm tryna say is
I don't hate the game just the player
Until that pound cake come in layers

[Hook: Meek Mill]
