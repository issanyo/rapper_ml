[Intro: Bok Nero]
Yeah yeah
Jahlil Beats, holla at me

[Verse 1: Bok Nero]
Bought a new burner, I need [?]
Rubber on that handle so it cost a bit
And for red Benji I got Major Lazers
I could make you Diplo in that while she split
Before the money, I been fuckin' model chicks
I swear to God man, none of this shit new to me
Except now [?] hollow tips
And I drop a couple bands on jewelry

[Chorus: Bok Nero]
I swear to God, when I spit these rhymes, I go out my mind
On my mom, knew that I'll be rich, all it took was time
You and me, gotta pay that fee, boy I'm on my grind
Like my S fucked up with two lines, that's a dollar sign
I swear to God, when I spit these rhymes, I go out my mind
On my mom, knew that I'll be rich, all it took was time
You and me, gotta pay that fee, boy I'm on my grind
Like my S fucked up with two lines, that's a dollar sign


[Verse 2: Bok Nero]
Swear to God man, he go loco
I'm no joke-o, play with me boy, that's a no no
[?] like photos
Keep that burner tucked like low low
[?]
