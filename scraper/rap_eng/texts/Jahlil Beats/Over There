I wanna poke that Bitch over there
What you lookin' at? You the bitch over there
Come to me, don't be the Bitch over there
That' Bitch over there, that Bitch over there

She makes me sick, that bitch over there
A lazy trick, that bitch over there
Hey bitch over there, hey bitch over there

(Verse 1)
Hey bitch wanna say ma name?

With ma stick I call him "J"
You wanna take a hit? that shit cray
