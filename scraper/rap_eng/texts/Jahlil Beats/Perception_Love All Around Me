Part 1: Perception

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Sound like nights waking up in cold sweat
But it's worth it when you make it here with 4 checks
It's no such thing as one life with no stress
But it's a such thing as realizing you the best
Pray cause I know I'm blessed use bibles as a tec
I wash away my sins, God got me on my chest
She was going in, I started to sweat
From when I met her at the party, I started a quest
Had to take a step back and let it refresh
Birds fly they be chirpin and leaving a nest
If a chick need that work you just leave it to us
I got a lot to give, a lot of ones needed my trust
It's not the right time and you in a rush
You be right I be wrong, and let it progress
In yo tights in yo thong, I know that you blessed
In the night when I'm gone you wish I never left

[Hook]
What's the first thing you think when you here my name?
Watch it all don't even blink when I'm in your frame
Out of sight out of mind, but I'm here to stay
With my life on the line, baby, I made a way

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Aight now shoutout to everybody tryna get it like me
Just tryna hustle I hustle see the money I see
We give the bouncers hundreds we don't give em I.D
Cause they all know me, now it's time to see em win
And my bitch say I'm fine but I look better when I spin
The whip that we be in, it really all depends on the weather
We could drop the top in the summer
Or we could get the truck in the winter, cause we some winners
Them white girls say they love me like I'm Brody Jenner
Gimmie good brain, know that name I probably won't remember
Is it Ashley? Is it Jasmine?
We throwing parties, well love bitch I'm taxing
Bring fifty racks in gotta get my stacks in
Finna drop the album and the shit gon go platinum
Yeah, shit's so insane feel my glory nigga feel my pain
Young Rockie the name

[Hook]

[Outro]
When we first met we made a connection
Life all about direction
Yeah, love and affection
All they do is believe the perception
All they do is believe the perception
All they do is believe the perception

Part 2: Love All Around Me

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Yo city to my city come ride with me
You my nigga, this my city
We ain't trippin mayne it's all love
Got weed and bitches, I’mma call it up, call it up
When I’m in H-Town it’s love
When I’m in Cali mane it’s love
Young niggas getting money we on
Ain’t trippin bout these hoes
Cause it’s love all around me

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies ]
Tinted up, when I ride
AC on and it’s hot outside
They got a microscope on how we live our life
Young niggas don’t die, we multiply
She choosin on me, I knew she wanted it
But I’mma make Shawty work a bit
I’mma make mama twerk a bit
She just learned it’s so legit
21 and she say she strip
In the H-Town, getting cake now
Fuck it then, bust that shit open
Really ain’t nothing, just part of the culture
Young Veggies and they say this is vultures
But I ain’t worried bout nothing, I’m focused
In a Lambo with Kirko
Pumpin freeway like Moses
I get there off and see the damn roses
Talkin to my conscience, lookin for my common sense
Closet full Pumas and of Prada sneak
I’m a prodigy getting that monopoly
With some hoes that always had it out for me
Main girl know that she always got a house with me
We gon live it up just don’t give it up
Can’t deal with me if you don’t believe in me
I’ve been in streets since it froze in the south
I never changed, I get love all around
High off life when they see me comin' down
Love all around til it’s no longer found
No longer found, we the new winners get known in the town
Enough about me, now you heard about me
Love all around, bust em hoes to the ground

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I'm still heading to the future, nigga ain’t no lookin' back
And turn a dollar to 100, turn 100 to a stack
And I started from the bottom, take a look at where I’m at
Man I’m out here tryna get it while I’m livin' young and black
They know every block that I turned
On every blunt that I burned
On every dollar I earned
I appreciate it, appreciate it
These fuck niggas concerned
I got the shit that they yearn
And one day they gon learn
To appreciate it, appreciate it
My pumas rockin' locations and now they made some statements
Perfect verification of why you niggas hatin'
I thought my homies beginning to exist, instant claiming
We got power to change it, hit it after we name it
And when my nigga NY blowin' weed smoke
My bitch got new karats and a pea coat
She look into my eyes, she promised that she sees hope
Road tip, hop up in the whip then we creep slow

[Hook]
