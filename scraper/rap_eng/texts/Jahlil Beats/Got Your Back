[Hook]
You didn't call sometimes but I still got your back
I let you be a man and I dont trip about that
I'm here for the long call nigga that's a fact
And I got your back, I got you
You may do ya dirt but I don't bitch about that
May be a bad moment but you come right back
You my man baby and that's a fact
And I got your back said I got your back

[Verse 1]
Said I've never been tripping on what you do
Cause you hold me down like a real man do, do, new, new
So I don't ever care when you're out there hustling
Tryin get your paper up
Politakin in these streets tryin get your way up
Uh, and I know it's for me too
And that's why I ride, that's why

[Hook]
You didn't call sometimes but I still got your back
I let you be a man and I dont trip about that
I'm here for the long call nigga that's a fact
And I got your back, I got you
You may do ya dirt but I don't bitch about that
May be a bad moment but you come right back
You my man baby and that's a fact
And I got your back said I got your back

[Verse 2]
You know I hold it down baby
Stay by your side now baby
You know ain't no other lady
And ain't no other man for me
So I dont ever care when you're out there hustlin'
Tryin get your paper up
Tryin get your weight up
But I know its for me too
Thats why I ride

[Hook]
You didn't call sometimes but I still got your back

[Bridge]
Dont always treat me right
But for you I'll still fight
Whether you're wrong or right
Im gon' stick by your side
Our love is stronger now (uh)
Theres no way out (uh)
Can come between (uh) the bond that we have baby, me and you
