[Intro]
Uh
Get money gang
It's ya nigga J'arm
All i know is flex nigga
And i'm finna drop some bars nigga
Shoutout Bobby Shmurda
Nigga

[Verse]
In Toronto i'm some hot nigga
Fuck with me and i'll drop a nigga
And my verses are hot nigga
It's like i wrote them on the sun nigga
Last week i fuckin' shot a nigga
I forget why i shot the nigga
Ha, all you talk is guns nigga
Have you ever even shot a nigga?
This kush has got me sky high
Reload the Glock and do a drive by
I'm getting rich but ain't gunna die tryin'
So much money i ain't even lyin'!
All my niggas are criminals
But in the 6 thats typical
Sippin' lean and rhyming syllables
In the rap school you're a student and i'm the principal
Finna cop a new rolex
And i'm finna fuck your girl next
Nigga i'm not good i'm the best
I'm like the white Kanye West
All my niggas got a choppa, yeah
Hot nigga like a sauna, yeah
Huge rager at big papi's, yeah
Everything i wear is Prada
All my verses are dope
I grew up selling dope
Nigga i still sell dope
Anybody wanna buy some dope?
So much ice on my wrist you would think that it was hurtin'
But the only thing hurtin was that pussy that was squirtin'
I beat that pussy up like a nigga that was chirpin'
You don't wanna fuck with me and my dogs when we're lurkin'
Uh
Get me on a verse and you know i'm gunna spaz out
Every single night you know i'm mother fuckin' cashin' out
Catch a nigga snitchin' and you know i'm gunna knock him out
Pussy boy don't want no trouble but i bring the choppas out
Never leave the house without some drugs and a loaded Glock
I'm a ruthless mother fucker like i was born and raised in o'block
You won't see me chit chattin' with any niggas, i let my gun talk
I'll pull the fuckin' trigger and leave your brains on the sidewalk
I'm not afraid of the police
Lying to the opps so my nigga gets released
In my part of toronto you can't survive without a piece
Shoot you in your sleep, go clean the blood out your sheets nigga
Love my AK like it's my baby, North West nigga
I'm aiming for the heart, you'll be finding bullets in your chest nigga
Teach a fuckin' nigga not to leave without a vest nigga
Get money gang nigga
We the best nigga
I'm on top of my game just like that finally rich Sosa
If i'm not at the top yet than i can't get much closer
Schoolin' you pussy niggas, where the fuck is my diploma?
And you might play this rap game but nigga i'm the owner
I'm bodying niggas just like i'm bodying this track
You's a fake ass nigga and i just state the facts
I'm always going hard nigga no time to relax
I smoke so fucking much it feels like my lungs collapsed


[Outro]
Ha
I killed the game nigga
Mixtape dropping soon nigga
Whaddup doe
