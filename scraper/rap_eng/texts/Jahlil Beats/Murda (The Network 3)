[Verse 1:]
Act got him leaning he really fiending
He used to be the man on the field he Willie beaming
Big bro pumping his head he really deaning
I'm just tryna thicken the plot i'm really scheming
Hmmm leave him cold when i'm steaming
Let the chopper get the screaming made the doctor get the cleaning
Nigga, back buzzing niggas back balling
Them bitches jump ship them bitches back calling
Love for these streets ain't no love for these freaks
She was sucking me off now she fucking with Neef
Shit it never surprised us once I hit her i'm off her
Once she give the wombs and shit all she can offer
Learn that from uncle Veno
Heromedics and peno once we hit em we get em
We ain't causing a scene though
On site no bike life they riding like chino
Bring a end to your day niggas digging your grave, bitch

[Chorus:]
Murda dem murda dem
Any competition am go murda dem
Murda dem murda dem
All this competition I come to murda dem

[Verse 2:]
Uh we just getting this paper, taking trips to Jamaica
Got me some more acres living with no neighbours
Living life in the ghetto piping them metals
Niggas claiming yo clock put some ice in the bezel
Hitting shit from a far roll a spliff in the jar
Papi give me some work I be finish tomorrow
Rolling that lala she popping that na na
Who copping that shit, extended clip for that ra ra
I'm smoking that totem she busting it open
Pussy looking like lotion finna dive in that ocean
I'm talking that Milli, i'm chasing that milli
Fully loaded to drum niggas waiting to chill me
Catch that work in the drop young niggas working the house
You niggas get outta line them niggas marking shit off
I'm from the home of the killers real as the gangsters and dealers
Fresh niggas fucking these bitches molly [?] getting some thriller
Shopping at Stacy Adams, bitches eat there we had em
Niggas don't want no status down on them ratchet [?]
Once we loaded and them haters shoot them exposing you divas
We [?] with death bitch so you know they can't beat us
Pussy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I just came home from Europe it's the life of a Tour
I used to be on suburb streets selling rocks outta tours
Man I rocked out the garden and I rocked over shores
People jumping for me and touches they loving New Orleans
Bubble of [?] they was above the water
Some thirsty brat haters they don't get none a the water
[?] and lean put the beam on the tours
Just keep on rolling these put you under water
This is [?] manslaughter on on yo camcorder
You can hear how I ride on your Ipod
You can visit my home through your Iphone
Come to my lab on your Ipad
New technologies reality but I spit quality till ma salary Surpass your salary
My dream cars reality I play monopoly while you ride with a bus pass
Don't get it twisted I started with a rough life
Turned all ma ink gods into a must have
Started off broke now i'm faded with a lot of cash
Everytime I post a selfie get enough likes
Drama, Tom calls me plumber cause I bust pipes
Winter it's Timbs in the summer yea we rock mics

And ima stop bragging mama said it's not nice
Uh yeah yeah uh
