Verse 1 :Moltisanti
I'm in the cut with Swizzy, the son of Mufasa/
Told the mothefucker  "you're my chosen brother"/
Now watch me flip these raps into a matte black Benz/
Just had a hell of a night, with Mary Jane and her friends/
I'm blowing THC/
You can cop it from me/
They just copy from me/
The flow he got it from me/
The juice he got it from me/
Its gonna be a minute till you make it/
Cause you faked it/
We've been down like the basement/

Verse 2 : Swizznation
I don't hold grudges/
2 sets of parents, 4 magic touches/
Tin-Tin , Danny turned brothers from cousins/
Cooking, so I'm hotter than the oven/
Killed the beat so I put it in a coffin/
Flipping bitches weight so I'm catching bodies/
Take a shot don't depend on anybody/
Armani, looking at the flow and its hotter than your mami/

And all these niggas in my way I pray I stick my fingers through the Dibaz that's the only way you'll dance/
Show me what you got my nigga all you talk is smack/

Verse 5 :Miscellaneous
Contemplate if you try me, I be the era of the 90's/
Might just mic script cause I spit, hyping the peers right behind me/
You'd bet few were prepped to play Russian roullete with a feature/
Seize the lead, unleash the beat seek to reach deep with heat-seekers/
Huh, no competition, ain't seated at common ground/
Believe it I ask whose keeping it heated and not a sound/
Even heathens, they fell beneath him the reason can't calm him down/
These ingenious flows in the frequent, marks the end of your morale/
I script this cursive, grip the surface, this turf is accomplished/
And every verse is murderous, spit without an accomplice/
And every factions, matter fact is fabricated with sanctions/
I drop a track and it's traction knocks you off of your axis/
And when I think about my life today/
Guaranteed identify me by my license plate/
I'm scripting like this on my rise to grace/
And hope that y'all remember me, for my lightening pace/
