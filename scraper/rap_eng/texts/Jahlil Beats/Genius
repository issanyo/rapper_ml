[Verse 1: KuuL]
Ridin out, ridin out
When i talk my shit I'm never hiding out
My attitude is fuck it
When addressing the mass public
Because mothafuckas love it
Yes! muhfuckas love it
Juke that hate that come my way
Everyday I'm on my grind,Money on my mind
I ain't got no time, No watch on my wrist!
Ain't cause I'm broke nigga
Hah you joke nigga
You the one sittin on the couch
You press the play button
Rewind cause you love what you hear
Who this kool nigga right here?
Dude with the smooth moves all year
Oh yea
Lets go there
To the place ain't no turnin back
Need a low jack

[Verse 2:KuuL]
Started in my room in east New York
Me, rell and gabe for starters
Then Okane and them older niggas started comin thru
I was makin moves, with nothin
I could show you niggas somethin
Bet that
Stepped back, dont regret that
I learned alot then snapped right back
Like that Rubber band  around them stacks
Got money dont announce that
Just get more
Don't speak the tongue, just speak floss
Just speak shine, diamonds no flaws
On her mind, all the time
That's why she need a nigga on his grind
Always gone but I'm always on her mind
