[Verse 1: Upseaux]

I make idiot decisions
But it balances out cuz I'm a genius
She calls me smarty pants, yeah I know I'm a Jeanius (Genius)
Fucking these hoes, rubbing them the right way
They be like boy don't try to "Genie" us
Cuz i stay with a bottle, sippin' it full throttle
Like eh, I'm a oblivious
It's devious, this whole game
Sell your soul for mo' fame
Burn like propane,
Body numb, I feel no pain, no gain
Try to take shots at me, no maim
No injuries no wound,
My name stays relevant, nobody knows you,
Put yourself in a casket you bastard,
You flaccid, rob your funeral and leave you with no tomb.

[Bridge: Upseaux]

Slow it down on some slug shit,
These immature dudes tryna be on some thug shit,
All on that mean mug shit
Looking like a scrub shit,
Staring at the kid when there's a million girls in the club shit.

[Verse 2: Upseaux]

I don't know man but that shit's weird
But it seems like most of you "G's" are queers
I ain't against gays but you got some bent ways
I'll walk away and you're staring at my rear?
Got damn, is this what being a thugs about?
Having no fun and grabbing your gun
And chilling everyday on your corner hangout?
Claiming territory, telling terror stories
Like you about this life man
Funny shit is that block you claim
Is actually owned by white men
Get it right man, It's only right man
I'm tryna enlighten your brain filled with dark stains
And try to make you bright man
The flows enticing
Your flows 50 Tyson
My punchlines leave rappers knocked out
When i get on the mic (Mike), Tyson
Triple entendre, Oh your honor
Can't sentence me for my sentences being too hot
Even my cell would be a sauna, uhh

[Hook: LJ]

Cuz i ain't fucking with you
I ain't fucking with you
Niggas getting scared
Like i got a pistol (x2)

[Verse 3: LJ]

I make people feel at home comfortable
Down to earth kid
But you know you can't fuck with him
Loyal to the end homie
Only to the family
If you got some beef with them
Then you gotta pass through me
Gotta go hard nigga cuz this shit won't be easy
Keep hating dog, and I'll squeeze your bitch titties
Swagger magnifique, yeah go ahead critique
Better yet, give some head
Go ahead and suck my dick

[Hook: LJ]

Cuz i ain't fucking with you
I ain't fucking with you
Niggas getting scared
Like i got a pistol (x2)
