[Hook: N.O.R.E.]
See I'm decent nigga and they gon' treat me good regardless
When I was your age I had at least ten charges
Started slangin' coke and then I had a few menages
Now the rap game got me changing my [?]
Facts, facts, facts, facts
All I'm gon' speak about, all I'm gon' talk about
Facts, facts, facts, facts
All we gon' speak about, all we gon' talk about is facts

[Verse 1: Yung Reallie]
Trayv Martin on 'em, come through with my hood up
But I ain't got Skittles, man, I'm shooting when I pull up
Brand new coop, shittin' on 'em like a Pull-Up
If I don't do nothin', nigga I'mma bring my hood up
Heard I'm gettin' money now these bitches on my dick
Started moving pounds now I'm switching up the whips

Little homie's on point, fuck around and get hit
See I'm a hood nigga so I won't be picky
Don't need no menage but I'mma need Nicki
GoodBelt Gang, got the whole cliche wit me
Man, niggas don't front 'cause they know I keep the blicky

I'm similar to Ali, Muhammad part b
OG still on the run, yeah fuck the police
Jose Luis, [?], I made a way for them to eat
If you from Queens then roll with me
Now I'm in Miami on my music hustle
GoodBelt Gang bitch, that's a Gucci buckle
