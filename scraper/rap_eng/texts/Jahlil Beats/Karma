[Verse 1:Jinsu]
She told me that she love me
Told her that I loved her too (her too)
Ain't gon smoke the pain away or drinking day by day
You in the way gotta plan to get rid of you
So let me start it their ok we started friends
Yo hands placed on my cardigan thinking back
I wasn't smarter then from nights I was partying
Watchin them bring the molly in cold but I probly had ignored
Blinded by all them compliments
Oh damn I figured out the whole plan thought I knew you better
Just a thought from ya old man learned alot that I can say
But rather keep it bottled in played the bad guy for now until that karmin kickin in (that's right )

[Hook: Tay Walker]

Just like anything that stays on the ground
Whatevers in the air needs to come down
And when ya running with no where to go
All I'mma say is I told you so
All I'mma say is I told you so
All I'mma say is I told you soooo
All I'mma say is I told you so
(only come down it's the big chain)

[Verse 2:Jinsu]

A big chain and her wrist painted my whip paining
They all red you leaking I guess we twins baby
In coming call to my phone I glanced at it
Having second thoughts on it cuz it say unknown
I picked up what up she said what's up
I said not much I had a long night to be honest just gettin up
Whipping the cold out my eyes she begin to speak
Bothered by the fact that we haven't even spokin' in weeks
I'm venting all these small tales mine is on a long trail
I hung up and lied saying that the call failed (she ain't gon by it)
But so (yall ain't together) I know but listen bro could careless
If she with it though I take it back call you a bitch but take it back
No I don't it's just a fact for the way you gon' act
Learned alot that I could say but rather keep it bottled in
Played the bad guy for now until that karmin kickin in (that's right )

All I'mma say is I told you so
All I'mma say is I told you soooo
All I'mma say is I told you so
(it's the big chain)
