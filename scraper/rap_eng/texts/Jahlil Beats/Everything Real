Real niggas, real ice
Real shit, real life
Everything real on my side
Everything real on my side
Foreign whips, foreign clothes
Foreign bitches, foreign hoes
Everything real on my side
Everything real on my side

[Verse 1]
Shout out to Avion, you keep my neck dripping
Blue hunnids, red fifty's, all my money set tripping
Been like Crips and Bloods, we hit the club and rip the club
Y'all niggas can't sit with us
Cause I'm in VIP rocking Givenchy
Bad bitches, I bring 'em out like TIP
Jay-Z, go AP, VVS stones
Niggas can't breathe cause I'm the heir to the throne
I ain't got no challenges, I tell 'em get the hell out and dodge
Cause I only keep foreign coupes in my garage
Feeling like Meek Mill, I woke up to a m√©nage
Like damn, it was just a massage
A while ago but she like making niggas uncomfortable
The mouth was amazing, pussy incredible
Don't worry 'bout niggas cause they all set at you
You know that they jealous, look how they look at you
These niggas be talking shit in they interviews
But when they come to see me, ain't none of that
Come on, fucking with a kid that'll split your wig
Run up in your crib when you with your kids
Don't do it, don't do it
Tell your ass again, nigga, don't do it
You saying that you real, we gon' hold you to it
Oh you saying that you real, we gon' hold you to it

[Hook]
Real niggas, real ice
Real shit, real life
Everything real on my side
Everything real on my side
Foreign whips, foreign clothes
Foreign bitches, foreign hoes
Everything real on my side
Everything real on my side

[Verse 2]
Came in the club with many men
Cause I got power like 50 Cent
Flexing on these niggas like in the gym
A nigga eating good but I'm looking slim
But I'm doing doughnuts in that 458
Tryna get a crib in like all 50 states
More money, more problems, more hate
Hit 'em with that dirty 8, make a nigga home shake
If you wanna dance
Got the new blue hunnids sitting in my pants
And she gon' bust it open when I throw them bands
Said she wanna fuck with me, well, that's the plan
Follow me, baby girl, I make hits for moolah, might promote my shit
And once he put me on, we gon' all be rich
Tell the bartender, yo, she got' suck my dick
If she don't fuck me good then she don't get no tips and that's real

[Hook]
Real niggas, real ice
Real shit, real life
Everything real on my side
Everything real on my side
Foreign whips, foreign clothes
Foreign bitches, foreign hoes
Everything real on my side
Everything real on my side
Real niggas, real ice
Real shit, real life
Everything real on my side
Everything real on my side
Foreign whips, foreign clothes
Foreign bitches, foreign hoes
Everything real on my side
Everything real on my side
