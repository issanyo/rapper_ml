[Verse]
Yo, 24-7, 365 I do numbers
Pick up that lettuce like tongs, I'd outdo yiu dudes in my slumber
Got your hoe nude on my tumblr
We keep ballin’ when niggas fumblin’
These mediocre niggas boasting and I keep tryin’ to act humble
But now I'm like fuck that
Enough is enough and you niggas ain't bringin’ enough back
And on this table, where my niggas welcome to eat boy you can't get a cup at
Show you the way like a compass
Reach from afar but don't come past
Got a heater in this compartment, let’s see if you really could make a comeback
Started from the bottom
With a flow that belong in asylums
Told myself to get ‘em; I got em
On ten like October
Me and yo’ bitch on one accord, so it's only right I get behind ‘er (yeah)
Y'all see these rappers, I only see food, they fresh out of water
Never content with losing, I just keep stocking up like a garter
Regarded as one of the best
Hard to guard like Jamal Crawford on offense
She suckin’ me like a crawfish, spillin’ Remy all over my carpet
I'm in quarantine
Rollin these boats that could soar the sea
I'm the source for the sort of shit you can't even sort of see
Gotta make it to the top ain’t no backin’ me down
All the niggas who be hatin’ in the back of me now
You get stripped like the Factory
Get yo’ issue like a magazine
Make you put that racket down, Andre Agassi
We not partners, you ain't next to me nigga
Probably put a broken leg on your legacy nigga
Is you willing to die for your dynasty?
‘Cuz when they put me on the tracks, I be serial killin’ ‘em
But really doe, my niggas spark like Omilio
For them mighty duckets I'm Emilio
I get that money no problem, when I want
And I don't need no keys like a peely doe, ‘cuz his is shit is really dope
Packers at Eagles, put the green in the Phillie
Pour up, til’ I throw up, then get fucked up again
I’m “prescript-it”, you’re pre-scripted
Treat your door like the jar by the drawer and leave tips in it nigga
I done pulled your card
Know the flow up to par
Heard “oohs” and “awws”, they damn near tore up the bar
Better with bars than y'all niggas could of imagined
Know niggas who never made it, already a has-been
And niggas who overrated, I hate them with a passion
When I get on, I promise to put them in a casket
A mass attack on em
While on tree like ornament
Tore up the whole tournament
Nigga show me an opponent, I’m here, yeah


[Hook]

Show the world what hunger sound like
When you got to get it from the absolute bottom this what it sound like, yeah
You get a full clip, not a sound byte
Nigga this what hunger sound like
