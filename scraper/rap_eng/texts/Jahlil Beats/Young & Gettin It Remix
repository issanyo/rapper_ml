[Intro]
Young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
Young and I'm getting it, I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches cause I'm young and I'm getting it
I'm young and I'm getting it

[Hook]
Okay I wake up in the morning, and I see dollar signs
Shawty wanna roll and I'm like aw man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine so
Why you hating on me, huh, I'm just living my life
I'm just young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
Young and I'm getting it, I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches cause I'm young and I'm getting it

[Verse 1]
Yeah, young nigga I get money and fuck hoes in my spare time
She don't fuck on the first night, then she don't meet my dead line
Niggas smoking that Bob Marley, that Bob Marley like yeah molly
I'm sipping on the whole 8th for that purp shit, bed time
I cop fours like yours, y'all niggas ain't important
Shawty want that molly, and I'ma get what she order
Tats all on my body, strapped up like a war
Eat the pussy I'll prolly, if it smell like water
Her neck talk say fuck me, my wrist talk say suck me
The niggas claiming they balling, I take your bitch Chris Humphrey
And make them buy me a whip nigga
Nothing less than the 6 nigga
Y'all running yo mouth like hoes, all y'all some bitch niggas

[Hook]
Okay, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
Said Shawty wanna rolling, I'm like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I'm just living my life
I'm just young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
Young and I'm getting it, I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches cause I'm young and I'm getting it
I'm young and I'm getting it

[Verse 2]
Okay, your baby mama, I ball that, side chick I ball that
Main chick, I ball that, and your dream girl just called back
I'm still repping that north side with that big P on my ballcap
These broke niggas don't like me, cause they say I think I'm all that
Now come cop that 'rarri, I don't need to feel sorry
Niggas claiming my flows, I should put these niggas on Maury
And I ain't claiming these hoes, have these haters looking all salty
When I pulled up in that Roll's, swag was surfing on 'em like narley
I'm with 3 hoes like Santa Clause, saying I'm the boss, Diana Ross
Hit you girl by mistake nigga, wasn't even in my plan at all
I told homie I hit it that, these niggas wanna be playin' it off
Knowing that girl is main thang, that shit don't like nigga, bang, bang

[Hook]
Okay, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
Said Shawty wanna rolling, I'm like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine so
Why you hating on me, huh, I'm just living my life
I'm just young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
Young and I'm getting it, I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches cause I'm young and I'm getting it
I'm young and I'm getting it
Young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
Young and I'm getting it, I'm just young and I don't give a shit
