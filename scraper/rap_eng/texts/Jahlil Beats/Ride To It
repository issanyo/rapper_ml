[Intro]
Top down, Ocean Dr. flow, Nah, leave the AC on, baby

[Hook]
So we ride to it, say a prayer, get high to it
Count our blessings without chasers up in our fluid

Ain't no sense in asking questions you know how I do it
Just have La Perla on that ass when I arrive to it, until then

RIDE TO IT, Ride to it, RIDE TO IT, Ride to it x2

[Pre-Verse]
She got that champagne po'n
Loud pack blowin'
Neglice on, waiting up for me, for me x2

[Verse]
Baby girl, Why you staring in that visor?
Getting MAC all on my shit when you know that you the baddest
In gym but super thick, Lord knows that ass the fattest
Lummus Park on Ocean Drive, sun-tan lotion up ya thighs, Damn
Only time she wear Truey's when it's time to swim
Only time I wear Louie is when I'm tryna win
Only time I dial her number's when I'm tryna sin
No kissin' or huggin', golden rubbers when I'm tryna send
Chills up your spine baby, just ride baby
Sun rays shining through blinds, close your eyes baby
She light my dutch, I pop her clutch, I'm tryna drive her crazy
Get money where it's sunny is all we thinking lately

[Hook]

[Pre-Verse]

[Verse 2]
Baby girl, Why you pressin all them buttons?
Second letter steering wheel, YSL, you fine as hell
Ain't no weave, ole natural, loose the roof we might as well
Cause I know you love attention & you stuntin' on these bitches, Yeah
She let her hair go, She got a Range Ro'
She's Bi-Sexual, She's Bi-lingual
And when she speak it she be leavin' niggas so clueless
Slid thru just for the Weeknd we made Loft Music
Double D's on balconies, that ass is so stupid
So in love with the backshots with no cupid
I do's this, I does this
Don't be foolish, you know you gotta husband

[Hook] x2
So we ride to it, say a prayer, get high to it
Count our blessings without chasers up in our fluid

Ain't no sense in asking questions you know how I do it
Just have La Perla on that ass when I arrive to it, until then

RIDE TO IT, Ride to it, RIDE TO IT, Ride to it x2
