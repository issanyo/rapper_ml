It’s been you since dat first moment/
Remember me goin in ta kiss your cherry tone lips/
You were shocked first, but den you kissed back/
Damn girl I never thought I’d fall this bad/
I even went as far ta go an meet ur fucking dad/
I must say he’s rad but for me to fall in love is sad/
Baby girl don’t be madd cuz now my heart is stuck on you/
Yeah I swear to tell the truth so believe me ur beautiful/
So elegant and sweet/
Just like a candy piece/
Everytime I see you my heart skips a beat/
You a beauty girl an I’m a beast/
You keep my heart running girl like a track meet/
In da back seat of my great uncles car/
Girl give me head like you a fucking porno star/
Babe you so great an amazin like a shootin star/
You can go around the world twice if looks could go far/
No par girl you perfect like a hole in one/
Like t-pain baby girl you really got me sprung/
To match ur perfection a million songs must be sung/
If god made you den it was a job well done/
Praise the lord for basking me wit all her fuckin beauty/
I love everything about her especially her booty/
She hits me up to have sex call dat call of duty/
An when we go to the mall we both ball like rudy/
