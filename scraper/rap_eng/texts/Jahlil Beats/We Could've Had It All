[Verse 1: Milo]
Uh…
Uh…
I thought we shared something, since you had my heart
This art you’ve inspired has me walking a thin line from falling apart/
I fell in the dark/
What’s better than tripping is falling in love?
My vision of us is now faded off shots of
Remy, Henny/
Baby, I’m drowning my mind
Bitches trying to get on my time
But I watch you, cause I want you/
I look at your name in my contacts/
Temptation is crazy, but lady you made me understand the hard way
I’m not scared to show I care, but I hope you never take the broad way/
Relating to a ho ain’t my forte
Reminiscing on thoughts of our foreplay/
Damn I miss you, really wanna kiss you/
You left, and I know I’m right
When I tell myself, “I can’t go back”
Cause a heart ain’t a heart when there’s a crack/
And if I took the shot, you’d block me
SHAQUILLE/
And if love was a game
This knick-knack-patty-whack would drive a dawg fuckin’ insane/
So who’s to blame when we all press play
I mean it when I say
I still want you, still think about you
Through night and day/
Uh-oh you know/
Maybe if we were from the same globe then
I would be satisfied with your ocean/
And I wouldn’t need you, mentally as I do
But I want more than just your body boo/
Lock it with a kiss, throw away the key
That way I know it’s true/

[Hook: Adele]
We could’ve had it all (repeat x8)

[Verse 2: Milo]
Yeah…
Uh-huh…
Tell me lies, yeah tell me lies
Cause the truth don’t really sound the same no more/
No store can sell what I’m looking for/
Yes, I’m talking about “real love”
Not the fake stuff
Still think you Miss America even with no makeup/
And I’ll be your Superman with no cape on
You worry bout me when I don’t come home
Blowing up my phone, baby nepalm/
The fall doesn’t frighten you
Bet the bank on me, that I’ll catch you/
No fear like I’m Spiderman swinging with eight arms/
Hold up
These fantasies so enticing/
I’m lost in my dreams just sightseeing
A blind man could see my vision, no Visine/
Remnants of a heart, lost in the dark
Bitches in the past could probably tell it all/
And if it go that far, then I deserve it all
Karma run full circle, that’s all/
Hollywood with their damn movies
"Halle good" with their damn boobies/
Got me thinking I need a 10
Fuck her mind and fuck her friend/
Damn, what the hell happened to me?
Yes me/
Twitter game so bitter
Tweeting thangs wishing I was still with her/
But flashbacks ain’t half that good when it’s all over
Casual text like “What’s up?” when we ain’t sober/
And I know it don’t mean a thing
Or does it? Or was it because she still wants me too?
I don’t know, is it me or you?/

[Hook: Adele]
We could’ve had it all (repeat x8)

[Bridge: Milo]
We could’ve had it all, just you and me girl
Could’ve hit up the mall, and bought you the world/
Instead I’m alone with shit on my mind
And I’m out of my zone, still trying to find/
Your love… your love, your love/
But I gotta move on
I know that we will never work/
Now I’m in the club
Bad bitches, bad bitches ahh
Twerk, Twerk
Yeah, they twerkin’ for me/

[Hook: Adele]
We could’ve had it all (repeat x8)
