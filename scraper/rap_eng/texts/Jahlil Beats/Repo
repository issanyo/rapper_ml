[Intro]

GME
GME Pistol
Huncho, you better sit your ass down boy!
I ain't fuckin' around

[Verse 1]

Imma tell you what'll happen if you diss me
You gon' have the biggest picture on the news screen
Dead faces on the book is in my news feed
For a couple [?] do the whole team
Got a couple young-ins that'll blow boy
Everywhere they go, they be toting boy
Never leave the crib without the papa
Them niggas is shottas
They'll pop it at your mama
Catch a nigga lackin', pistols will get to poppin'
My niggas love choppas, and we will get to choppin'
We don't kidnap, we leaving 'em in the kitchen
Take a man down, dump shots and I'm rippin'
I was in a jam, thought it was the end
But I kept fighting and you see I still stand
They callin' me the man, shout out to the city
GME the team, if you ain't with me, you against me
These niggas tryna hold me back and I resist it
Never been the type to do a hit and leave a witness
Never been the type that got to stressin' over bitches
These ho's goin' "Oh God, I'm a witness,"
Niggas that you trust will be the niggas that will hit you
Drop fat 10's and pretend that they miss you
Same way with bitches, ho's be the issue
That be the reason why them boys come and get you
That be the reason why you layin' in a casket
You was finna fuck and all you see is shorty blastin'
[?] crew step in, flag 'em, trash 'em
Treat 'em, like a dutch, smoke 'em, ashes
All black skully, I'm on my Call Of Duty shit
I said Black Ops, Imma let the tooly spit
Heard about Huncho, who the fuck is he?
His home boy, Budda say he will murda me
I'm on a murder spree, not only on the beat
The water too deep, so you will drown in the sea
I guess he think he hot, cause he fuck with FBE
These fuck boys don't want no beef
And this is not a diss song, this is just a message
Before you diss me, I can make niggas regret it
I ain't with the actin', I'm better with the action
Keep a 4 Nick Cannon, and I ain't even actin' Whoo!

[Outro]

It's GME, man, GME Pistol
Fuckin' shit up bro
Oh yea, it's on
Don't reply, cause if you reply, it's only gonna make it worse on your ass
I'm baggin' niggas up
GME, L's, and I'm out
Done talkin' (Done)
