[Verse 1]
If you think I'm just in and out to make a quick buck
I'm in it for the long haul, looks like you got shit luck
I got my ear to the net, and y'all shit suck
Game needs change, yeah it's ready for some nip tuck
Back to the old school, master of Pro Tools
This kid went to private school? Yeah that is old news
Catch me up on YouTube, I'm the one with no views
Independent artist, see me standing on my own two

[Verse 2]
These are uncensored thoughts, no filter
I'm rough around the edges like your grandma's old pictures
Hip hop in this city, baby I'm the sole fixture
You wanna know the recipe? Well it's a bold mixture
Pull the wit of Gambino, the honesty of Drake
The passion of Kendrick, throw it all on a plate
Sprinkle in some Macklemore, add some Earl Sweatshirt
And a tinsy bit of Ferg cause you know I put in work

[Verse 3]
Fresh to the casket like bread in the basket
I rock a mic all night, crack the back of a bastard
Y'all MC's are fake like you wrapped in the plastic
There's a code to the game and I hath gone and cracked it
Spitting dope on you lames, and that's just for practice
Y'all are soft as the pad on my mattress
My girl a lady in the street but she a bad chick
Reppin' for the kids who never had this
