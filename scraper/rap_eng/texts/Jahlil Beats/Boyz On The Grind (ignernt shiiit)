[4311 production]

[Intro]:

Baby, Baby, Baby
You better believe this
Baby

[SteeZy]:

That's what these things look like
All 24k gold and they all look nice
Flow so cold in this winter night
Heat it up then I'm taking flight
Waiting for my summer grind
Po' a deuce in my lemon-lime
Add a jolly, bitches wild at the party
Lolly lolly she know how to work her body
On them mollies â€“ call er' Molly Poppins
She keep it dropping, Never stopping
Not an option, like my breaks missin'
Take a break and get lifted
Rally, rally Youse' a bitch kid
Smack Sally if he dissin'
Pop the lid and start ignition
Burning gas, got my thoughts drifted
Smash the pedal, on another level
Hit the treble, hit the bass, hit the bump
Man you know my speakers thump
S T double double E Z Y
That's the fly guy stunting right into the sky
Blunted feeling stupid high
I ain't coming down
I ain't clowning around
'Bout the sound, not the noise
And your boys are unbalanced
No swag, no poise
Bitch

[Hook]:

Boyz on the grind
Boyz on the grind
We just Boyz on the grind
Tryna' get it on time
We don't bullshit or worry
Pass that in a hurry
And if the police come then we out in a scurry

[Trob]:

I am sippin' from the fountain of youth
Catch me in a Bentley coupe
Scoop scooping' up a bitch or two
I ain't even look at you to see the honest truth
Through your lies, through your eyes and you know that I ain't ever gonna die
Die, die...
Here comes Sally

[Sally]:

Yeah I got a big dick
Bitches think I'm so sick
Coming right at you
All I say is "ah chu."
Rawest rapper in this game
Blasting off, I got that fame
Making green on the reg
Bitch cross me I'll cut'chyo leg
Fuckin' up hoes on GTA
Don't forget that Johnathan's gay
T-Rob making raw beats
Fuckin' yo bitch between them sheets
Sippin' on 40's, not my style
Try to force me you'll hit that tile
Orange Crush, my kinda drank
Damn Steez, this green is dank
Logging onto Reddit, looking at kitties
Shit fuck ass titties

[Hook]

[Outro]:

Boyz on the grind
Boyz on the grind
We just Boyz on the grind
Boyz on the grind
Boyz on the grind
We just Boyz on the grind
