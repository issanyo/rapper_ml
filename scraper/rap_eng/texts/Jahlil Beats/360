[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I tell 'em money on, huh

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I tell 'em 360, 360, 360
See the room spinning around, 360, 360, 360
Watch the money fall down, 360, 360, 360
Baby turn that ass around, 360, 360, 360

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I know you see it go around, money full circle
Blunt in full circle, smoking on that colour purple
On the beat I go silly, real ugly motherfucker
Bitches love that I'm a rapper but she know I ain't a sucker
360, look might break your neck
Everybody double take now I'm late on set
Got a pocket full of green, faces like Gumbee
'Bout to take another round call it 720
Headed to the club going close in an hour
One on one on, East bound and down Kenny Powers
I just took off face look sour, I can here 'em screaming my name like Alvin
I'm just sitting back recline like Calvin
High you can see it in my eyes like Simon
Going way past 60
Girl I think you just missed me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yo I say what goes around comes around, 360
When it comes to bad bitches I keep three with me
One to fuck me good, one to suck me good
One to ride hard, hold the work tuck it good
Only thing I wish, I wish a motherfucker would
I'm living life and getting money like I fucking should
I'm on another level, that make you understood
Oh you ain't understanding, nigga I am making good
360, we make 'em 360
Popcorn looking like a box of rice crispy
If I don't make the record shit the feds gonna get me
Cause I'm gonna keep shining on these haters 'til they hit me
100 thousand dollars cash, $20 bills bitch, I be on that real shit
Tryna chase a mill shit
Just came back from Hollywood and Ill Will, the Will Smith
Right back to the hood with my goons tryna kill shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I said bitch I'm the bomb, everything hunneds
'Bout to take another round call it 9-hunned
Call me when you sitting home alone like Mc Culkin
'Bout to leave the club but I don't know where the fuck the sun is
See me speeding through the city like we racing in a summit
I ball, might crossover, hop step, dunk it
360, leave the hole open in a fast break
Why you think yo girl ain't call since the last date?
Huh, I'm gone, backspace
I've been rozay red, cafe
Bunch of bitches on they tippi toes like ballet
Smoking all day, have an eight in the ashtray
Get it good, hit it's feeling like a facelift
I don't recycle motherfucker I'm wasted
I got a head like Gena
And my bitch got an ass like Trina

[Hook]
