[Verse 1: Problem]
Ariba, Ariba, Ariba, where's the bitches?
This crazy boss just fucked up the game word to the clippers
My enemies bitch got her face right by my zipper
Tequila is laced, give me my space
The weather is thick give me a case I'm tryna get fucked up
Keep looking crazy from across the room you're about to get fucked up
We always pack, but I don't feel like tripping tonight
Cause I am too busy living the life, pass me the drugs
Andale, andale
I don't think these niggas wanna go there
Young rich nigga and I don't care
Same crew since I was a little one
Since day one  been a real one
And I put that on all my children
Walk in and the hood start cheering
No pom poms I bomb bomb
I touch that motherfucking ceiling
I'm on your side fuck that side the gang is the gang
You say you're my friend but you standing with them so you are the same
You gotta get it with them
Oh ah oh ah and I get a rhythm
In us we trust sucking my nuts try, good luck

Sniffing coke on the way to day gold
Turn your hood up nigga bang your gang
Turn to your homeboy watch him bang the same
