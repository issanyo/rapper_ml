[Verse]
See I be riding through my old hood
Same old attitude
Chillin' with yo' girlfriend
Why she always mad at you?
She be like blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
Only time that she quiet
When my fingers inside her
Don't know you know I'm a rider?
Yeah I sleep in her stomach
And I sleep with a 50
Just to keep her 100
Yeah my swagger's so dummy
We so stupid so silly
I watch them girls getting lower
Then a kick in the milly, uhh
Gambino, why you got a gold chain?
Cuz girls only gunna see you when you stuntin' man
I'm coming back
Swag on row gain
Girl let me see your 2 chainz on then
So hood, whatcha talkin' bout?
Man I'm watching Law & Order on my grandmas couch
Eating lucky charms for dinner
Loser to a winner
Swag so clippers
Me and Blake Griffin
Me and Blake Griffin
Why them hoes tripping
You ever seen ballers like us both pimpin'?
Ha, we getting drunk like a Kennedy
Ha, we stay fly like the end of Greece
Yeah I got O's like CP3
Don't worry, don't you worry, don't you worry about me
I'm only worried when that period's on CPT
When that period's on CPT
