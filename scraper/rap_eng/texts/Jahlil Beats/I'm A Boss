[Verse 1 - Corny]
Staying up all night, Its my life I get no sleep
Because I always keep it coming, bitch I always proceed
I'm a boss and you're below me, claim you kill shit but you're phony
Bout to kill this instrumental, then running from the police
You don't know me? I'm a hokie, and I'm always down to blow tree
Never low key, not an OG, bitch I'm reaping 7-oh-three
And I'll always rep the metro, that's my hood, it ain't no ghetto
Still I rap and record demos, smoke some green to keep me mellow
And I like my bitches yellow, I'm a real boy, no Geppeto
I got haters but they Jell-o, think they'll stop me but it's hell no
Trying to hold me back like velcro, but soon I'll make em let go
I'll just build my reputation brick by brick, LEGO
See what I did? That's a double entendre
Getting money and fucking bitches are to things I'm fond of
Also fond of weed I smoke that shit like I'm rasta
Dick like an anaconda
Still whipping in a Honda
Riding through my old hood, still in my old whip
Same old attitude, these other rappers bullshit
Claim they fingers on the trigger and they ain't afraid to pull it
I'll put an end to your career and I don't even need a bullet, I'm a boss

[Hook - Meek Mill]
Bitch, I'm a boss!
Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots
I call the costs
We in the bitch
It's goin' down
Yeaa I'm the king
Now where my mu'fuckin' crown?

[Verse 2 - Corny]
Bitch I am a boss and you are my subordinate
Ain't talking about a Honda when I say I want a foreign whip
With a foreign chick who's pouring shit like we just won a tournament
Make my money extortionate, I love to rap I was born for it
Rapping is what's best for me, call this shit my destiny
Want a life ecstasy with bad bitches next to me
Smoking potent medically, I'll live my life so pleasantly
While you live a life of jealousy and try to hold me back, that's a penalty
I'll decline it, won't forget it, I'll remember just who did it
And when my paycheck's 7 digits I won't feel the need to split it
You say I won't but I'll get it, I am way beyond committed
I'm not new to the game, been in it, and I'm in this shit to win it!
And I'll do so at all costs, I ain't never gonna stop
Going to the top so let the champaign bottles pop
In celebration of my victory, I'm a boss with no business degree
I pity fools like mister T and I'm going down in history as a boss

[Hook - Meek Mill]

[Verse 3 - Corny]
I'm a boss and y'all employees, all you do is just annoy me
You're smoking on some weak shit and I'm smoking on some noisy
I smoke green strains, soy beans and colored strains like Boise
I'm the self proclaimed boss of rap, I don't need you to appoint me
I'm the king of this shit, even tho I'm somewhat new to this
If this the first time you're hearing me you better get used to it
I'm improving in this music shit and ima keep pursuing it
Until "Chris is the greatest" is a rudiment
And the haters recognize their foolishness
When it comes to school I'm a student
But when it comes to rap I'm fluent
It comes to me so easily, lyrics pouring out like fluid
I don't think man I just do it never cautious in my movements
Always under the influence, bumping music, never mute it
Hold it down for those who rooted and leave haters looking clueless
Bitch I recognized my dreams, you could say I made em lucid
Turning haters into lovers, I guess you can call me Cupid
Look the part, I'm always suited, I'm a boss, it's undisputed, I'm a boss
