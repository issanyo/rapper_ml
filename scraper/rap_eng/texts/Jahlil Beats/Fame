[Verse 1]

I might be flirting with Success
But I still don't fuck with Fame, though
I be on my own shit
You can leave me alone, bro
Bet she love me long time
Ain't know that was your hoe, yo
Mess around and send her back
Guess we'll call that "promo"
Yeah, should've kept it on the low, though
I got flow, snatching souls
I be on, whatcha know?
Success sucked me off
We'll call it kinda low blow
Comatose, Calamity
Hit it once, catastophe
Apostrophe, above your eye
'Fuck you think you saw, my guy
Open mind? Open what?
Open mine with my last fuck
What?!
Fame could never change me
If you ever really knew me
Always known I've been this crazy
Before she ever became baby
There was nothing she could say
That could ever really phase me
Lately, more than ever
I'm just wishing He could save me
Yet I bet He probably hates me
Ain't all groovy, ain't all gravy
She's a bitch, she ain't no lady
I could never really call it
Even though she's always calling
I'm just always out here crawling
How she's always got me falling
Fucked around and put my all in
Messed around and got to balling
Now I'm clawing and I'm gnawing
I ain't never really stalling...

[Break]

[Verse 1 continues]

I'd never share my last breath
With this bitch named, Fame
Too busy cheating her with Life
Ain't that a motherfucking shame?
She's way too devious, mysterious
She thinks I'm out here delirious
Please, it ain't ever been that serious
At the most, I was just curious
Don't flatter yourself
It's much bigger than wealth
I want the diamonds, want the riches
Want the album on the shelf
Out here committed to self
Remember asking for help?
No! I didn't think so
Did this on my own
Ain't ever had to fake those
You wouldn't know about her, though
Busy walking 'round with your eyes closed
Lots of typos, lots of might gos
Then I went ghost
Spazzed around on some microphones
Then I met Sleep
Now she calls me every night
She talks so sweet to me
Always singing lullabys
Yet I see right through her lies
Every time she bats an eye
She's the devil in disguise
Noticed Fame in the corner
Yet I walked on by
Even though her beauty lys
I've never been surprised
Never had to look twice
Always knew what she's about
The prettiest distraction
Out here walking at me now
Got me tripping, acting out
Might've had a little doubt
Told her, "meet me down south"
Yet it's colder up north
But I wanted her to use her mouth
Bitch! Show me what you're really 'bout
She messed around with her clout
Then fucking blew my brains out
I was like, "wow," really wilding out now
Thought about throwing the towel
Then I scowled and raised an eyebrow
Her girl Fate walked by
Gave Fame the cold shoulder
Started reaching for the sky
Heard a resounding echo like
Who the fuck is this guy?!
It ricocheted louder
'Til I grabbed Fate's eye
Introduced myself as Ghost
Realized I still had Fame by my side
Fate opened up and said to me
"You wanna live forever?"
"Wanna solidify in time?"
"Then look Fame dead in her eyes"
"You better tell that bitch bye"
Only had one question
I just wanted to know why
At this point I, was lusting for Fame
I gave up my name
I gave her my chain
I gave her my heart
I'd given everything
She said she'd ride or die
But I guess things change
Lovers rearrange
But this wasn't love, though
She didn't love me for me
She was in love with the hustle
I couldn't love her for her
I was in love with her potential
Fate sat my ass down
Then she took away my pencil
Said, "why stay out here, if you're sinful?"
Then I knew who she was sent for
For the first time ever, Legendary showed her face
She was the most beautiful thing
I swear I'd ever fucking seen
Though her relation to Fame
Almost killed my fucking dreams
Fame said, "Legendary? Yeah, she's a cousin to me"
Then I found out Death, she was a cousin to Sleep
It all runs in the family tree
But Fate's of no relation
So I kept her with me
Is this the relationship I want?
Well, I guess we'll have to see
Started sharing me with Fate
And then she showered me with riches
"How'd you do with Life before me?"
"And all them other bitches?"
She gave me back my pencil
Said I just really had to listen
Paid all the wrong attention
Went missing from the mission
All went left with Success
Guess I thought I was blessed
But she stripped me of my innocence
Then it resonated
Good riddance of my ignorance
It all came in common sense
Yet Life is still my side chick
Ha! Ain't that some fuck shit?
Most important thing to take from this story
Is Fame is still a fucking bitch
And she's still fiendish for this dick
And that's it
True spit...
