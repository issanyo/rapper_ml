[Intro: LQP Qua]
When it's wartime, rainy days gon' come (yeah they come man)
I'm from the hood where father figures we don't know that (not at all)
The 18th, right murdered, it's his 4th one (it's his 4th one)
When I was young I made money doing store runs (store runs)
All these little girls acting like they grown-ups (like they grown)
She only 13 but she doing grown stuff (that's a shame)
Having unprotected sex with the wrong one
She caught something, doctor said "you ain't got long hun"

[Verse 1: LQP Qua]
My hood where them young niggas stay beefin' (uhuh)
So I grab the .45, trigger squeezin' (what up?)
Good aim, he ain't hit the bull, he hit 3 kids (what up?)
Got caught, judge gave that boy 103 years
Classrooms, they don't show up, they don't care dog (raw)
His squad versus his squad, it's a standoff (raw dog)
Crossfire, youngin' got shot in his rib cop (uhuh)
The god is fucked up, you got gypped son (uhuh, uhuh)
Damn dog (aw yeah)

[Hook: LGP Qua & ZahSosaa]
Everybody in my hood man they ruthless
All them young boys wanna do is shoot shit
All them lil kids dropping out of school quick
Bang bang bang another body on the news man
Everybody in my hood man they ruthless
All them young boys wanna do is shoot shit
All them lil kids dropping out of school quick
Bang bang bang another body on the news man

[Verse 2: LQP Qua]
Ain't no love up in the streets
Ain't nothing for you in them streets (nope)
He can't even cop a nick, they want for 40 in them streets (uh)
Yeah im from a place where don't nobody trust police
Because the 2 things they don't show you is show justice or no peace (facts)
Graduations, we ain't never make it to 'em (no we didn't)
On-only funerals, eulogies, and the viewings (yeah we did)
Channel 10, daily shooting, they action news then (R.I.P)
I seen niggas get money get on some new shit
Nighttime, keep your door locked, it get real then (uhuh)
Hands up, he ain't got a gun, cop still killed him (uhuh)
Got a job, changed his whole life, op still killed him
Playboy, shot him in his back, man they will cheer them
You a queen, he called you a bitch, where your pride at? (yeah)
He actin' up in school, teachers wonderin' where his pop at? (yeah)
He trappin' on that block because that job never replied back
Some niggas die to live but this the place you live to die at

[Verse 3: LQP Qua]
Your place got rich people with the big house and the grass green (uhuh)
My place got drug dealers, shoplifters, credit card scheme (what up?)
Instagram mack you looked up but in real life you lie to the B (fraud)
Nowadays you wanna be a thug
You ain't gotta shoot, niggas retweet (facts)
Doin' good, they gon' hate on you
But they only do it cause they like weed (that's a fact)
Same niggas you would die for be the main reason that you 6 feet (gotta watch 'em)
Saw the news, I was feelin' bad
It was a body, youngin' that was 16 (uhuh)
First time he shot a gun, he caught a body
But the body was his family (aye)
