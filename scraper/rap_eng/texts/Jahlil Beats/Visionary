[Intro]

Its your boy Juvi man and I'm back, I know I had everyone waiting on a track, but this rap shit don't stop. This is only the beginning !

[Verse 1]

Never catch me in my city
All them niggas hate
Every day grinding looking
For my next plate
Got a hole in my chest
Revolver shot to a nigga
Used to be broke now im gloing
Now you envy at a nigga
Don't trust a fucking soul
Devil was with God
Type of nigga, drop a nigga
Then call up his broad
Never taking shorts what's
Good with that nigga meek
You niggas caitylns you
Want your brows on fleek

[Hook]

Got your bitch on the line
She knows I'm the man
Lame nigga dissing yeah
But he just a fan
I'm on the fucking rise
Headed straight to the top
Your bitch sees the rise
She wanna give me top
Fashback to my past
That's a life in poverty
Making so much bread
My nigga fuck the lottery
The city i am from
Respect is mutual
You respect a nigga
Or expect the usual

[Verse 2]

Fake bitch niggas always
Been Caitylns to all bruces
Guns drawn, they sex change
So called bruces be caitylns
Came from the city of demons
Where they kill for medusa
Never trust a bitch they be
Snakes like they medusa
Ima pull up in all black she
Wants her dark knight
The past is a big lesson
No thoughts at night
Why look back when I'm
Forward to the riches
Fine fabrics, fine whips
And fucking fine bitches


[Hook]

Got your bitch on the line
She know I'm the man
Lame nigga dissing yeah
But he just a fan
I'm on the fucking rise
Headed straight to the top
Your bitch sees the rise
She wanna give me top
Flashback to my past
That's a life in poverty
Making so much bread
My nigga fuck the lottery
The city i am from
Respect is mutual
You respect a nigga
Or expect the usual

[Verse 3]

Don't want no bitch back
They call it scoliosis
Always ahead of em call
Me the Energizer bunny
No bathroom at grandpops
Thats stains in the field
I got hella drillers
Hitting stains in the field
Worked all the time that
Was for the Chinese men
Now I'm really gettin it
They like Juvi you the man
We used to be chained down
Now my niggas chained up
Don't fuck with alot dudes
Man I swear they all changed up
