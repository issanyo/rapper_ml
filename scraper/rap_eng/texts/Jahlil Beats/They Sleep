[Verse 1: Brookfield Duece]
They don't want to us win (Nah)
So what we gonna do? We gon' win
That's a major key
Yeah I'm in the major leagues
Yeah I'm center stage fan boy
You can take a seat
Watch me drop 40 down your tonsils
The snubs we know end with nostrils
It's hostile, it'll cost ya
Blades on the shoulder man
Kids of the old block, chalk it to our environment man
Yeah the chips all we got
Retire boy, we gon' be here for a minute
Nate charge by the hour, he ain't voicing all the critics
Believers come from the cynics, and ya'll just did a sentence
Told them come A&R, come control all the tenets
Feeling like I'm a Yankee, all I swipe is the pendant
I been dumbing down the flow cause most of ya'll wouldn't get it
Alright phony I'm in it
The pretty chick? Yeah I'm in it
[?] that's how a dog gotta get it
OG up in the game, brown sandals white linen
How the hell Imma lose, ain't no L in "I'm winning"
Brookfield don't allow that, Oakland high like a wildcat
We never coming down, satellites go around that
I sound like I'm comfortable
You think you dope but you sound like a buster do
I'm hungry, you a lunchable
He said he was only short 10, why you buss him for?
I said he take that, ain't no telling what he telling folk
Put him in a choke, give him pressure, Ms. Stretchable
Don't make me go to Latrell boy, you looking like Carlesimo
These players funnel in, when they gone you don't miss them though
While you in these halls it's gon feel like detention though
Class is in session, we either win or we learn, we never lose
So this hate is a lesson
Finessin' while ya'll stressin'
My presences here is a blessing
Would wake up but I'm out and they ain't dressing

[Verse 1: Dame D.O.L.L.A]
Yeah I come to the light
Everybody grab ya shades cause ya boy that bright
Yeah I come to the light
So everybody grab ya shades cause ya boy that bright
Let me holla at ya'll about a few things quick
I'm as humble as they come, but my shoe game lit
I ain't make the all stars but I'm flu game sick
Last time they count me out, what I do Game 6?
You know the answer, but keep it to yourself
I really love this game mane it's deeper than the wealth
I was taught to play for keeps but never keep it to yourself
Real recognize real and I only see myself
See a lot of things different, I'm blaming my environment
Ism I was gettin' is the reason ya'll admire him
Ten toes down, and that's just a requirement
That private housing peaceful when you used to hearing sirens
See I'm a major key, you suckers ain't a factor
The 'gram say you get it but I'm getting to it fastter
I done did financial aid, I even did a FAFSA
Made it to the league, still went and got my Bachelors
Savvy in the streets, and crafty with the rock though
Crusin like a Porsche but still looking out for potholes
Money got a smell, they was watching me at Roscoe's
I was on alert, [?] syrup on your waffles
I'm not like these others, my swag stay the same
I got a lot of cash but I ain't after the fame
Cause that's just a shame, I don't need the validation
But ya'll do ya'll I hope you reach your aspirations
I been told that I was petty, and I don't beg to differ
Cause I come from the basement you can call me Big Tigger
My moves calculated man I'm something like The Riddler
Moving on from you cons, follow in the steps of Kemba
I hardly take shots, but when I do I swish 'em
And then we have a party, call that a bar mitzvha
See I don't play games, I'd rather work the system
Dame put in that time, and dollars what it gets him
I hardly care bout the critics, I'm killing they won't admit it
Underdog, rob the cradle when they trying to babysit it
Raised around goons we ain't much into the gimmicks
Play dumb but really smart, I used to rock that Academiks
They been sleeping on me heavy for a very long time now
Big on respect, I'm bout to start cutting in line now
I be on some other, getting harder to wind down
I pull into my gate and see I built myself a compound
I'm hard to satisfy but I be feeling gratified
A lot to be thankful for, simply being alive
Doing this for the town, this envy, it be my pride
I turn into Forrest Gump if you send me to Vietnam
I'm a solider ask around, nobody can ever question it
Beef or get along, I ain't really got a preference
Watching from a distance, and put together evidence
Always been the type to have to know who I was messing with
Land of the strong I was made by the struggle
Learned a lot early I was saved by the trouble
Lot of friends in the grave that was gauged by the shovel
I'm popping boy these haters throwing blades at the bubble
Watching out for they, just watch what I say
There's some folks up in your circle with they eyes on your payment
Save it for another day, I ain't trying to cause friction
I ain't trying to cause problems, I ain't trying to cause distance
That's none of my concern, let me stay up in my element
Even though it bothered me that ya'll ignore the elephant
He gon' change culture cause he bring some type of relevance
And I don't like give (whoo) and I plan on staying celibate
They sleep
