[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Bitch, I'm the trap god, I'm still trapping hard
I'm still talking 'bout them chickens in the wall
You don't Shmoney dance then you don't Shmoney talk
I call my Shmurdas, tell my Shmurdas set it off
And when my Shmurdas set it off they leaving chalk
Bitch, we the hottest thing coming out New York
I walk up in the party, I just came to ball
I do my Shmoney dance, now she on my balls
Now you boys ain't 'bout that Shmoney, you need to stop it
I call my Shmurdas, have 'em popping at your noggin
I said you boys ain't 'bout that Shmoney, you need to stop it

But who them boys right there? Those my shmurdas
