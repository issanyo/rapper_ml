[Intro]
Yo son I been hearing remix
After remix after remix...
My nigga, not one person has spit
Any real bars or spit anything memorable
Like...ill rip this shit for fun and still
Body niggas that's really tryna get discovered
Off of this shit. I'm bout to put these
Hot nigga freestyles to bed real quick forreal
Yo. Yall ready?

[Verse 1: Zay-O]
YAOW
I get my schmoney on, throw my fitted cap into the stratosphere
It don't come down, like how I'm feeling when the loud is here
My hip hop vets, I spit that true shit that you proud to here
If lyrics get nasty ill bring them q-tips to clean out your ear
Hard to hear? We'll we ain't blowing loud nigga we smoking noise
And we roll em by the quarters I ain't talking coins
But that don't matter if you don't hear it you'll feel it
But this ain't about dancing it's a rescue mission for lyrics

But these party people need their dance just to get on down
And schmoney dancing is the current choice
Now everybody wants to be a hot nigga now, but that ain't none
Of my business; (Kermit Voice.)

But this is not a diss I'm happy schmurda made it
Cause me and millions love the flow it's just them haters hate it
You gotta watch a hater jealous of the bands on you
They'll try to hate on you but get they schmoney dance on too

But if niggas get the yappin and the theivein yo. (thievein yo)
We'll just catch them on the streets later
MITCH CAUGHT A BODY BOUT A WEEK AGOOO
Then Mitch got bodied bout a week later

My team will step up to your door kid like we theta
Then leave you shredded in a bowl like a cheese grater
Please hater don't touch that mic unless you able
And you don't want to do that cause trust that shit will get fatal
You will get cradeled, snatching niggas hearts like I'm Kano
Dj's know I'm on spinning my schong like a dradel
Signed to no label, nigga cause ain't nobody able
To give me that deal so I can put food on the table
But that's gon change yo, give this video a few a days though
Them likes and them shares gon be popping right off the page yo
Simple and plain yo, front and center just like ya navel
Then half of new york is gonna be listening to zay yo

Cats hit the studio but fail to know the bars they spit be all bumming
Cause they team be on some yes man shit
I get up in the booth and all my niggas know a storm's coming
Like thunder sound in an x-men flick

This single blew my team into a wall of guap
Now chicks come to mingle and want to roll out like an autobot
But ain't no cuffing, hoes ain't loyal they're on their playing shit
I'll buy a yacht and call it relation thats my relationship
Won't find no rapper that spits violent like me
Cause all my lines punch faster than muhammad ali
Got metaphors floating like angels over heads probably
Now watch a couple shiesty majors try to come and sign me

But I'd rather be independent no money gon change him
Cause the rap game done took more souls than shang tsung
And my flow is amazing its too real to be caged in so like johnny
I'd rather split and remain a free agent

And watch a nigga still gon blow, like a mega star
Evil extraterrestrial flow, like i'm megatron
I'll leave your body parts on the shore, like a megalodon
Few of the only rappers you know, that's spittin clever bars

Yeah there's people that want that hype, turn-up type fun hiphop
To beebop too
But there's some equals who seek that right lyrics tight real rapper shit
But be like from who?

Well if you have heard Ab-soul these days, then you know hip hop alive
And there goes something for the pain, and...

There's an overly dedicated kid named kendrick
A good kid from Maad city its known to us as section 80
His rhymes are overtly decorated shit is hectic
His flow is quick and mad gritty that control verse was freaking crazy

Maybe this is what kendrick wanted last summer
Sorry bruh needed a year to clear them last bumpers
And like I told you if you don't feel it you'll hear it
So share this shit on you're wall if you give a fuck about lyrics, nigga

[OUTRO]
Nah mean. It's crazy man, the producers got more bars than the rappers
These days. It's gonna be a cold winter for all of you hot niggas man
Im telling you. SOULdiers we out here man, shout out to the fam, we out here
Good looking Glo
