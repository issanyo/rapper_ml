[Intro: Quilly]
They need to start giving me these jawns
Hey Jahlil, fuck wit your boy, whoa!

( I don't like the look of it!)

[Verse 1: Quilly]
Goons on deck, Dev don't shoot them
Ken and Ryu them, hit them with the Hadoken
Dropped the new wave, write niggas' out the unit
Came from the bottom, I'm just tryna silver spoon it
Blowing something fruity, sticky like a loogy
Pockets on WAM, man we ain't' smokin' dooky
And all we know is bean players, we ain't serving pookie
Drive through and get that popcorn, minus the movie
But I'ma tax you for that popcorn like it's the movie
Cut from a different cloth, I'm stitched like a Coogi
And I ain't trickin', I ain't paying for no coochie
And homie you ain't pimpin if you paying for the coochie
You ain't tweakin', we ain't speakin', no need for convo
All about that dough, I'm bout that cheese like combo
Get wet; poncho, Ace said pronto
Before Wade, a nigga had that heat like Alonzo
Early in the mornin', early in the mornin'
I dropped the wave, killed the competition; niggas' boring
And we get features to the price is right like Wheel of Fortune
I'm spanked out, I'm a free man, call me Morgan
You ever grind dawg? You ever been in the kitchen?
It smell like Pine-sol, You touchin' for and a half
You knockin 9's off? Did you ever let it lock up?
Did you ever whip the crack until' the pot bust?
You a flea money, I sell coke
But I ain't never try to test the coke out, I ain't G-Money
Let the pits bark, I don't keep them on a collar
Mugga Mason, I can spot the Owl on a dollar
If them hoes gon' choose then let them holla
But don't try to cuff them hoes like you a copper
Catch me in an SS, it ain't gon be Impala
Sippin' on that Laker, feelin' like the black mamba
Yeah, nigga far from an athlete
I be at Hibachi's, eatin' lobster and crab meat
Holla at the Ahki's but just to get the baggies
Real niggas' with me, they ain't bitchin' like Shaggy
Cop a whole chicken', break it down to McNuggets
I'ma milk the whole game, chic-fil-a them, it's nothing
I'ma bust in her face, don't even tell her I'm cumming
That's what you get for cuffing
Like Seth and McLovin
Weigh up and bread right, don't run no red lights
But you can give me top like dandruff and head lice
The plan is to never fall, low key, never draw
The fiends gon' cop, we got drop like forever fall

Right, yeah, ha right, yeah, right...niggas' ain't fuckin' wit me
