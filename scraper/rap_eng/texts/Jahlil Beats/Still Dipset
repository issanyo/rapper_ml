[Intro: & (Jim Jones)]
It's still Dipset, boy, you know it's Dipset
(Capo)
It's still Dipset, boy, you know it's Dipset
(Hah, oh)
It's still Dipset, boy, you know it's Dipset
(Here we go)
{Jahlil Beats, holla at me}

[Chorus: & (Jim Jones)]
It's still Dipset, boy, you know it's Dipset (go)
I been fresh, yeah, I'm hard to impress (huh)
I got killers, triggers on the index (hah)
I see through these niggas like they Windex (woo)
That's a fact, that's a fact, boy, that's a Fendi (that's a fact)
Got it back, hard pocket, got it (I got it)
That's a fact, that's a fact, boy, that's a Fendi (that's a fact)
That's a fact, that's a fact, boy, that's a Fendi

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
(Jones!)
My roof missin', call amber alert
The coupe drippin', that's about 300 grand for the verb (notice)
Shit, Chrissy want a Birkin, 30 grand for the purse
Niggas lurkin', that's when shots from the hammers disperse (Draco, Draco)
I done watch when man threw up a whole hand full of percs (uh-huh)
He said he tryna find a loop 'cause the Xans didn't work (loopy)
He knows these lil niggas shoots like the cameras don't work
And they be fuckin' up the game, it's the grammin' in [?] (stupid)
I done had to bury so many my mans in the dirt (uh-huh)
Re'in up on the 15th and cuttin' grams on the first (what you need?)
If you on the run, you better get your stamina first
Because I got so many homies in the can for the work (goddamn)
I mean, that's a Fendi, that's a Fendi, that's a Fendi (that's a Fendi)
The top down when this shit is gettin' windy (when it's breezy)
We up town, got the bricks to the [?] (oh)
My top down like Richie in the Benzie (woo, woo!)

[Chorus: & (Jim Jones)]
It's still Dipset, boy, you know it's Dipset (go)
I been fresh, yeah, I'm hard to impress (huh)
I got killers, triggers on the index (hah)
I see through these niggas like they Windex (woo)
That's a fact, that's a fact, boy, that's a Fendi (that's a fact)
Got it back, hard pocket, got it (I got it)
That's a fact, that's a fact, boy, that's a Fendi (that's a fact)
That's a fact, that's a fact, boy, that's a Fendi

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
(Woah, that's a, yeah)
That's a fact, that's a Fendi, yeah
Keep the rod 'cause these niggas lookin' fishy (pussy)
Fully loaded semi like really nigga, really?
The shit I pop, bet you whip'll make you whip, pop a wheelie (12 o'clock)
Uh, I see through these niggas like they Windex (Windex)
Keep the bug spray for you insects
Still pushin' weight and I ain't talkin' 'bout no bench press (nah)
5K a day just to get dressed (yes)
Another 5K just to get my bitch dressed (yes)
Harlem nigga, keep my kicks and my whip fresh (yes)
Splash brothers, me and Jim been Steph and Klay
Cam, he was KD, Zeke was like Dray Green
Golden days, yeah New York was like Golden State (yup)
We was runnin' through the south and midwest though (west though)
Everywhere the set go, it was respect shown (respect shown)
'Cause real niggas respect how the set roll (woo)

[Chorus: & (Jim Jones)]
It's still dipset, boy, you know it's dipset (go)
I been fresh, yeah, it's hard to impress (huh)
I got killin' streaks on the index (hah)
I see through these niggas like they Windex (woo)
That's a fact, that's a fact, boy, that's a Fendi (that's a fact)
Got it back, hard pocket, got it (I got it)
That's a fact, that's a fact, boy, that's a Fendi (that's a fact)
That's a fact, that's a fact, boy, that's a Fendi

[Outro: Jim Jones]
Huh, you know that's a Fendi
'Cause we all Gucci on this side
Nigga, you know we Goyard
It's Dipset, bitch
The most powerful movement still movin'
Yeah, nigga
Billy got 'em, Billy shot 'em
You heard me?
Huh, point 'em out
Haha, Harlem what's up?
15 bangin', bangin' up chains
Uh
