[Verse One: Tayyib Ali]
Tell them bitches I’m that nigga, tell them hoes to tell they friend
They say that I look like money, I guess Benji got a twin
Living a dream, other niggas just pretend, I be balling, he just stand
Roll with me or stick with him, get it in, make it happen
Say you balling, show some action, I be rapping while my niggas play guitar
No Lenny Kravitz, hit the stage like y’all, what’s happening?
Never wait for a reaction, twist it up in Philly but I swear to God
It feel like Purple City, call my nigga Rockie, we knock ‘em, dominoes
Two of us and like 90 hoes, you ain’t trying to fuck, well you gotta go
But we might go chill, play that game, all type of skill
They say he sick, all type of ill, we (?), I ain’t got a deal
That’s sad bro, nigga in the air, no NASA, just ‘cause a nigga got his cash up
That don’t mean a nigga got his swag up, (?)
In the black truck, throw ‘em in the bag like Fabolous
Young skateboarder so hazardous, on my Philly shit till the casket’s dug

[Hook: Tayyib Ali]
Hard work for the dough, she say a nigga cool, keep telling me shit I know
See, I don’t follow rules, keep telling me shit I know, you see my clothes is new
Keep telling me shit I know, know, know, know, know, keep telling me shit I know
Know, know, know, know, keep telling me shit I know, know, know, know, know
Keep telling me shit I know, know, know, know, know, keep telling me shit I know

[Verse Two: Rockie Fresh]
I'm the fliest in my city, when you see me, say what's up
I'll be riding with my den, yeah, I'm all about a buck
I got hundreds on my table, fuck them twenties on your truck
Little homie think he fly, he can get them feathers plucked
My first mixtape was a smash, they called it beginner's luck
But Rockie still moving up and a lot of these niggas stuck
So I put they ass on ice, without no skates, without no puck
Call me Gordon Bombay when I say they better duck
And all the bad hoes love me ‘cause I show ‘em new things
Purple drink, Blue Dreams, APC her new jeans
A young king, nigga, you should go and ask about me
Ever since she got me, she could never see a ass without me
Roll around my town, y’all know how I put it down
King, give me the crown, yup, I’m so underground
But now a nigga blowing up, name everywhere
And I finna run the game, bitch, I’m a fucking player
