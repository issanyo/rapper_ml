[Verse 1]
Okay, came in to kill the beat
Oops, I think it's dead now
Bitch you won't shit from me
She thinking I'm a dead cow
Crazy, now where's my head now?
Crazy, I'm a mad house
I'm all about my cheese motherfucker like a fat mouse
I'ma boss bitch, fuck ya'll better recognize
Y'all can't see me motherfucker through eleven eyes
The memorize my words and take meaning from my thoughts
And they say a white boy on a beat spits raw
I told my team I'm a beast on a beat and that beat is me
So watch me eat, come take a seat and watch me teach
I guess that's life so sa la vie
I'ma one man fleet
I'ma run this sheet
If you don't like me you can suck my D
When you're on your knees look up and see greatness [?]
Woah, okay here I go
I'm running on this track, why y'all moving so slow
Yeah Witty is the name everybody should know
And to the ones who talked shit, thanks you helped me grow
And they know they can hate, but they have to respect
Fuck a hater with a big dick, fucking ogre like Shrek
I'm trying to manage all my spit but it's hard to ingest
I wanna show them I'm the best but their heart I impress
Yes okay, yeah pause, let me gather my thoughts
You wanna fuck around with me? Well motherfucker you're lost
They're talking to a bunch of Randy's I ain't talking about moss
I have more bite than a motherfucking gator, Lacoste ha
Take me in or take me out
Look me up or look me down
Tag me in or tag me out
I call this shit my stomping ground
Thinking you can stop me now?
Uh-huh no way you don't know how
I'm way above the bullshit, I'm riding a comet now
Thinking that I'm illiterate cause when I talk I just spit
Wanna take a ride girl, come sit in Witty's cockpit
Come to me, I'm dropping shit
Rockstar shit, I'm rocking shit
Thinking I'm a wild boy, I'm on my Waka Flocka shit
Nice guy so on my tracks I have to be the meanest
Like I said on Elmer's Glue shit, I'm lyrically a genius
You ain't got the magic no more man you kill for arenas
Spitting fire out my mouth got them thinking I'm a pheonix
I'm a dog like Scooby-Doo
I'm in the pants like Fruit of the Loom
Winning shit like whoopty doo
I'm complex bitch like a Rubix cube
Pick me up or push me down
Running shit like I run the town
I'm chilling with my martians so I'm never fucking coming down, bitch
Haha haha, yeah everyone jumped on this beat so I was thinking that it was my turn
Headphone Hero bitch!
W-I-T-T-Y and I'm the future
