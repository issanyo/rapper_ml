[Verse 1: Game]
There's a lot of sad people in the building, amen
Batman got niggas killing, God damn
We gotta pray for our people children, amen
I tell you honor let that pussy out
So I can light him up just like a church, preach
You let them out he getting murked, preach
Who in prison gon kill him first, preach
You gonna be riding in a hearse, oh preach
In that Maserati 2d, smoking on that oowee
Try not to brag, but I keep the cash
Got 50 racks in my Louie, got 40 more in my cuji
She riding round in that new me
So the fuck to feel my jewelery on
She mad about it bitch sue me
Yeah she blew me, that was last week
She call yesterday, I put her on her knees
And I let her pray, and I kicked her out
I gotta do me
Niggas always talking like they spit harder than Game
I done battled Jay, I done battle Fif' and I'm still sitting in my Range
Playing battlefield with a bad bitch swerving in and out of them lanes
You don't like me you can kiss my ass, my pinky ring and my chain
I done sold records, I done sold hoes, I done sold weed and 'caine
Got the game sewed up, nigga hold up, down south I'm Wayne
Pittsburgh I'm Wiz, New York I'm Jay
Atl I'm Andre, and in the MIA I'm Rozay
Bitch pass the Rose, I'm spazzing out, they ass is out
I'm cashing out Ke$ha
Nigga gonna bring back beemers
Resurrect around easter, get my check around?
Get my Rolls Royce: feet up, renew my french bitch: Visa
And hit the church, preach
Nigga so good I got a curse, preach
I threw that Bentley in reverse, screech

[Meek Mill]
I just wanna thank God
For all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
For my family
And lettin' me ball on these niggas

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
Do Liv on Sunday like a church (Preach)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Ros√©
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becoming the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life putting on, you spend your whole life putting up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'mma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill and Jeremih]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto cause it's a lot of...

[Hook]
