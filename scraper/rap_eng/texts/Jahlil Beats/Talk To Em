Hey Talk to Em' (Dame Dolla)
Hey Talk to Em' (Ey)
Hey Talk to Em' (I said)
Hey Talk to Em' (Mm hmm)
Hey Talk to Em' (We back at it man)
Talk to Em' (Listen)
Hey Talk to Em'

[Verse 1: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
They say the loyal don't budge and real G's move in silence
And thugs really in it not the ones promoting violence
I know a couple in it that's trying to get up out it
And it's all street knowledge they ain't get to go to college
A lot of people tapping in I'm male captain
We speak on what we say and we'un never rap again
I done made myself a villain surrounded by savages
Appreciate the struggle cause now it's extravagant
That Porsche got a hemi, look what god sent me
Pull up in my gate and see a Beamer Benz and Bentley
I hardly ever brag, and hardly ever sag
But tonight my pants low and 200 on my dash
I ain't make it this far to say I made it this far
Cause when I'm close to par that's when I gotta raise the bar
I ain't trying to be a star, I'm more like a Moses
Cause I'm the type to pump a lot of hope into the hopeless
Raised in East Oakland I'm a product of that
Made to survive anywhere can't get more polished than that
They glorifying goofballs I'm salty as Utah
When you real they uncomfortable plotting for you to fall
I went up changing up the game, forget about the politics
Stick my neck out for my loved ones I'm like an ostrich
I get a love around me you haters keep doing opposite
I'm really incompetent to taking many compliments
It sound crazy but I'm telling y'all the real
I stand behind these bars like I'm in a jail of steel
I never fall in line and I never be like majority
A lot of dudes with feminine ways it's a sorority
And no offense but I'm never hopping the fences
Cause that ain't in the blood of a cat that been in the trenches
Maybe turn a new leaf go and and get a degree
But the stuff these boys doing got a brother sipping tea

Hey Talk to Em' (Dolla Dolla)
Hey Talk to Em' (V.I.P.)
Hey Talk to Em' (ey)
Hey Talk to Em' (back at it again)
Hey Talk to Em' (We back at it again)
Hey Talk to Em' (We back at it again)
Hey Talk to Em' (We back at it again)
Hey Talk to Em'

[Verse 2: V.I.P]
You cats like Simba can't wait to be king
Talking with your mouths when your language is steam
Some people superstars play your role on the team
Keep it real with your words don't sell your soul for the bling
On these 12 hour shifts no Z's if you know me
Dark finish speakers yelling out to me 'royalty'
When I retire I'm walking off like Kobe
Planting all these seeds while my cheeks stay rosy
Word to the wise everything I say poetry
Mind stimulated my frontal lobe be floetry
What I bring to the world you can call it rotary
Dame in the game best believe I'm in the motor seat
The dream be free the grind sold separately
And I'ma hustle even when I've reached clarity
Gotta have integrity pure bred pedigree
A be coming in pay attention what the message be (Hello)

[Verse 3: Bozzle]
Ever since a teen I've had dreams of being a big dog
Young Zach Lavine from the line watch I lift off
Way before rap I used to trap up and zip some(?)
Now I'm trying to build an empire like I'm Rick Ross
Spit Raw smash whoever come against the guillotine
Jumped off the porch kinda early I was into thing
Me Dame and P all fam yeah this the team
With some more brothers from the gutter trying to get a ring
Hard knock life baby I don't do the make believe
Where I'm from they'll smoke you quick like an 8th of weed
Know some real hitters that didn't make it past 17
All my friends dead or in jail I had to change the scenes
Summer 16' yeah we just trying to get paid
Keep a solid bouncy Ben Wallace since the 6th grade(?)
Flyer than some polish you don't want to merge in this lane
But my life difficult you Don't want to feel this pain (Bounce)
