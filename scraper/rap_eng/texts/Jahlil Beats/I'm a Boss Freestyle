Man, I be lacin' up my blue Chucks, rag on the left side
Westcoast nigga, yeah the home where the best ride
Step into my zone where the best die, test I
Fresher than a mothafuckin' gangsta, yes I
Test drive your bitch, knock the wheels and muffler off
Blow your brains off, nigga you should've had a tougher boss
I'm takin' off in a old school, old school
A 80's baby yeah, I apply with them old rules
My spaceship out of bounds with them new shoes
The kush that I blow, smellin' like mildew
You say you real, fool? Nigga, I feel you
But if not; click, pow, I'ma kill you

[Kurupt]
I'm a boss, you salad toss
Toss salad, fuck around, bitch I'm a boss
I'm a mechanic, I fix the metal
I make it solid, pupateer like Joe pedal
Can't you see I got them new shoes on that new 2012
Can't even prenunciate it and don't know how it's spelled
Off of diesel and jet fuel, holdin' clientelle
New licks, I ain't tell, shoot yourself, might as well
I'm spiratic, a money mongrul, I'm hungry for them greens
I got bitches with money moguls from here to New Orleans
I'm so vicious, I'm hungry for it, fuck a triple beam
I'ma heat them niggas with the triple beams with triple beams
Red dot 'em, I got 'em, get 'em, hit 'em, set 'em down
Watch him get up, nickel hit 'em, fill 'em, spin 'em 'round
Nigga, listen I'm gon' tell you again about the Pound
Next time you hit the town, on my momma lay 'em down, nigga
Boss!
