Jackpot, im on the clock
My rolly go tick-tock
Retro 11's with some elite socks
Night clubs, they call it rock
First pump just like kiss
Rap verse but i can diss

Codeine & im feelin it
A bad jawn is what im workin with
D.A.P.S.S, do i get bad jawns, i say yes

Oh s***
We just hit the jackpot, woah
Get money dont stop
Uh
We just hit the jackpot woah
Get money dont stop, lets get it
