[Poem]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I see his misses on a mission
I asked her if she missed him
She say not at all
She asked if I cared
And I just stared at her and nodded naw
Grabbed her phone and turned it off
Now she won't return those calls
It's going down like a nigga head
When he nodding off
To bed...but we not drowsy naw
Far from being sleepy
Playing silk on them sheets there for you to meet me
In care of RSVP
And where's the vsop pour it slowly
Hopeflly you can keep a secret
What's she told me, now don't speak

[Hook]
This bitch bad
Oh my goodness
I see that you bad
I'm just tryna see what you good at
Could I
This bitch bad
Oh my goodness
I see that you bad
I'm just tryna see what you good at
Should I
This bitch bad
Oh my goodness
I see that you bad
I'm just tryna see what you good at
Could I
This bitch bad
Oh my goodness
I see that you bad
I'm just tryna see what you good at
Should I



[Verse 2]
She respect my hustle real rap raw
Call me her chocolate droppa
Shoutout to Kevin Hart
We both on borrowed time
Minutes were never ours
So I give her the business
She'll never get my heart
We'll never get that far
Those emotions are foreign
Sometimes I drown my thoughts
In drinks when I feel I'm too far in
I can't tell em apart
I can tell when we part
I be thinking about us
I can't tell her that part
Dear Lord
Lust is ugly but beauty's discerning
...pray I don't lose my way
I could use a good sermon
We be looking to creep
But our views don't concern em
Tryna check into suites
So those who knock it don't disturb us
Fuck like it's cameras on
Call this the panic room
She push the panic button
When I make her panties drown
Daddy now
But I'm her baby when I'm in that womb
So I beat the pussy up
Then lick the wounds

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Having problems at home
Her relationship rocky
So we talk on the phone
Though I hate to be talking
Stepping out on her nigga
God forbid that he walk in
He just beat to the punch
No relation to rocky
Both phones off
Like we both gone lost
And we both closed off
In that room clothes off
Those the rules doze? of course not
Got a hard on for that soft spot
Up to date but I feel more abreast
When she start taking off tops
Pleaaaaaase
What am I up against
Swear them low blows
Got me losing the upper hand
Pleaaaaaaase
What am I getting into
Maybe a broken heart
That's injury to insult
Shit
No I can't take that handicap
She put her hand on my soul
And told me she'll handle that
Man overboard
She tryna have me trapped
We may not have a future
But tonight we'll have a past like...

[Hook]
