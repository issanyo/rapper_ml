[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm right back in the mix
Rose bottle care
Ain't no stalking in this bitch
We're balling in this bitch
The seven be the whip
I'm heavy on the wrist
We came to have some fun
So keep your hands over your bitch
In the V.I.P look crazy
Haters with the shady
Pockets full of money
Is the way that you can lay me
And the DJ start to play me
Everybody going crazy
My whole crew got on Gucci's
Their neck full of jewelries

[Hook]
If you say you getting money let me see you
Call it out, call it out, call it out
If you're buying, all the bottles make you call it
Call it out, call it out, call it out
If them haters lookin' at you cause you're balling
Call it out, call it out, call it out
You're getting money and you said you're never falling
Call it out, call it out, call it out

[Verse 2]
Whole black panorama
Smiling for the camera
I only do a step
Cause I'm really not a dancer
I might just do a lean
I might be on that lean
We're bailing in that scene
To you it's just a dream
You can never get this money
Never throw these twenties
Never cop these bottles
And never fuck these models
See this AP on my wrist
Make a nigga sick
I cop all the Ciroc
And treat it like it's ?
I ain't playing around with you haters
I'm known for getting this paper
I'm buying the bar all night
And fucking a bitch tonight
I'm up for moving the white
This the way I'm living my life
My diamonds blue like a light
When I cop a car I cop it twice
I turn your bitch to a dime
Cause you ain't fucking her right
She ain't making it to home tonight
Keep going to beat your wife (huh)
I guess that's why these other niggas hating on me
I ain't tripping cause my whole crew waiting on me

[Hook]
