(Intro)
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok

(Hook)
If everything good and I can pay
Ma mother new jewelleries I'm gon' say
"It's a good day" I love this way
I'm livin' n I don't even need 1k

That's the life, no money
I got what I want
No wife, no honey
I need at the front
I got what I want
And all that mine, I feel so fly
I feel fly, so so fly

(Verse 1)
That what I was lookin' fo'
24, rookie hoe
20 flights, bookin' all
Baby whatchu cookin' fo'?
Dinner at ma Mum's house
Gotta eat it all out
You don't kno what I'm talkin' bout?
Ok let me teach you now
Come into the rest room
I kno it's the best room
Let me get you wet soon
Ok baby let's boom...
...n' I kno' you want a baby
I got already a lady
We like Eminiem and Hailie
We livin' that dream
But the life's still mean
Cuz cash rules everythin' around me C.R.E.A.M
Still same year, gettin' that cheddar so clean
Lucky charm, you better bet the chedder on me
That's the life, no money
I got what I want
No wife no honey
I need to be on
I’m doin' ma shit
Let me take ma hit
Lookin' up in the sky
I’m fly, so damn fly


(Hook)
If everything good and I can pay
Ma mother new jewelleries I'm gon' say
"It's a good day" I love this way
I'm livin' n I don't even need 1k

That's the life, no money
I got what I want
No wife, no honey
I need at the front
I got what I want
And all that mine, I feel so fly
I feel fly, so so fly


(Verse 2)
So fly like a nigga walkin' in Black Grapes
J 5's, matchin' with a shirt fulla apes
I do look great, so great you gon' hate
Y'all lookin' at me like I'm from United States
So fly like nigga smoked 25 J's
So fly every nigga wanna do it ma way
So fly like a kid who hides under sheet and then
He fall asleep to a lullaby J
Definition of feeling good: H.A.P.P.Y
Seems like I'm being it bitches still see me fly
They don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna see 'em cry
They say they love me n I do ask: Why u lie?
Girls want that benjamin
They do even lend a friend
Nowdays you ain't even gotta be a gentleman
I'm not a gentleman
Never been a gentleman
Get her to the bed does always depend on man

(Hook)
If everything good and I can pay
Ma mother new jewelleries I'm gon' say
"It's a good day" I love this way
I'm livin' n I don't even need 1k

That's the life, no money
I got what I want
No wife, no honey
I need at the front
I got what I want
And all that mine, I feel so fly
I feel fly, so so fly

(2x)
Y’all wanna see me fly? Y’all sure about that huh? Ok ok watch…
