[Verse 1]
Treacherous bitches tryna snatch bricks out the crib before you build it
Roll one up for my nigga, gotta smoke it alone cause somebody killed him
So I'm roaming the city stoned, won't leave the town alone
Stay puttin' on, new shit
Louie Vuitton case for the pool sticks
Want it off the brick, show you what to do with this
Audio drug lord, penning that dope for yo ass to smoke
Four bars like an 8 ball of snow
Hundred dollar bills rolled into a straw
She havin' a classic coke, her model feature still intact
That powder yet to take a toll on her
She in the suite at the game huntin' business owners
Tryna get one of them fools to throw a ring on it
Won't be me or none of my homies
That money got our attention every minute
Every second thinking of ways to bring them cheques in
It's a obsession

[Hook]
Focused on grosses, never on these hoes'
Jets up in motion, Land, Air, Ocean
Lames we don't know them
Game to be sold, not told
Count it up, stash it
Then bring some more in
This is not a game but we playin'
With some dope bitch
Paid in the shade nigga
Lemonade Mimosas

[Verse 2]
Uh
Airport passenger pick up
Lookin' like a showroom
This how our bitches come to get us
Every moment worthy of pictures
Each one worth a million
Shift gears like pulling the trigger
Killin' them niggas Leave they head spinnin'
They find they women missin'
Mama tryna kick it like a habit
But if its not bout cash I keep dippin'
That cadillac viscous
Thats the homie Vish shit
Painted and on switches riding to the bank
Fuck what a bitch think no tint on the windows
Sharks in the fish tank chillin
Twistin' a zip of that dank
On a mission to get bigger
Expansion, more mansions
More vehicles, more Villas
Imagine it, my nigga

[Hook]
Focused on grosses, never on these hoes'
Jets up in motion, Land, Air, Ocean
Lames we don't know them
Game to be sold, not told
Count it up, stash it
Then bring some more in
This is not a game but we playin'
With some dope bitch
Paid in the shade nigga
Lemonade Mimosas


Paid in the shade nigga, Lemonade Mimosas
