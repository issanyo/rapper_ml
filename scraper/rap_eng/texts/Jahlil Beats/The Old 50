[Chorus]
We fresh out the coupe, the homies point 'em out, I'll shoot
If your bitch bad, we scoop, fuck boy, you out the loop
We fresh out the coupe, the homies point 'em out, I'll shoot
If your bitch bad, we scoop, fuck boy, you out the loop

[Verse 1]
Fresh up out the Wraith, what's the combo to the safe?
Left right, left right, with the K
Oh you screamin', here's some duct tape, for your face
I came to your place, to put your monkey ass in your place
I dumped the body just in case, cop come searchin' for a trace
Disrespect I love to react to, clear the whole block with that MAC (boom boom boom)
This the kind of music you can trap to, everybody get down this is a jack move
And this is my city (ha), don't I sound like the old 50 (ha)
That chopper holds 50 (ha), so if you come to kill me, know you goin' with me (ha)
You niggas never left the stoop (stupid), I was in the field with the troops (the Hoolies!)
And your baby mama loose, I hit her doggy style, I move it like soup

[Chorus]
We fresh out the coupe, the homies point 'em out, I'll shoot
If your bitch bad, we scoop, fuck boy, you out the loop
We fresh out the coupe, the homies point 'em out, I'll shoot
If your bitch bad, we scoop, fuck boy, you out the loop

[Verse 2]
Tell my bitch pass the strap to me (let me get that)
Yea I gotta keep it strapped to me
Don't say my name in your song, this ain't just rap to me
My goons'll cough up your lungs, then bring it back to me
Nobody been this gritty since Suge
Yea, I make my city look good (you know that)
You maric√≥n you not a ghost, I ride with toast
When I approach, I fire close then adios
Y'all niggas beefin' on the internet, I'm beefin' with my shooter askin', "Why you ain't hit him yet?"
You niggas know I been a threat, you ain't met a nigga in the city realer yet

[Chorus]
We fresh out the coupe, the homies point 'em out, I'll shoot
If your bitch bad, we scoop, fuck boy, you out the loop
We fresh out the coupe, the homies point 'em out, I'll shoot
If your bitch bad, we scoop, fuck boy, you out the loop
