[Intro]

Yeah!

[Hook: Pre-Def & Epic Laine]

My niggas blowing weed like Peter Tosh
So many Peters, gosh
I might just pull out a cigarette
I'm wearing a panda mask
Are you faded
Where you at
Don't even ask

[Verse 1: Epic Laine]

You haven't heard of?
Caught sight, or probably stumbled on [Lucrative]
Your team couldn't match up to the teflon
Numerous, that's how we deal when we talk of death row
Showed up unannounced like a leprechaun
Feel like we took off panda masks
Cause now the people know
And now the people follow us, you wanna lead the show?
Snatching bamboo sticks
I'm hunting for the green
Fiending for a tight whip
Reaking havoc on the streets

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pre-Def]

Pre-Def is my name
It's me and my checkmate, me and Epic Laine
We're shoving up hip-hop, progress so insane
Since we checked in
Dog, the game ain't been the same
[Huh] That's what they all say
Nice ass with a surly face
You need a panda mask, and bitches look prissy
There ain't no problem with eye masks
I'm a party animal who said I need an eye mask?
And bitches look raging they wanna chip with wine glass

[Hook]
