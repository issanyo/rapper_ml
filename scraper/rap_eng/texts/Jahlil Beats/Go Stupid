Playing no games, this isn't Atari
And I be balling, this ain't Amar'e
I'm number one, I been fucking with Knicks
All of my niggs, they been with this shit
Butsing them bricks and fucking your bitch
Busters be hating but I'm getting rich
No toilet paper but I am the shit
Said I'm gone, I'm gone
On another level
These golds in my mouth, my nigga I'm trying to get some bezels
Got some hoes in my house, that'll fuck, man, whenever
Trying to smash with one of my hoes? You gotta break me off some cheddar
Hit the mall and copped a sweater
This Ralph Lauren on these leathers
And today I'm feeling mafioso
So I went and copped a letter
Hit the mall and copped a sweater
This Ralph Lauren on these leathers
Said today I'm feeling mafioso
So I went and copped me a letter
Go stupid

[Verse 2: Claude Antonio]
We going stupid
We on that cru shit
You ain't got no crew bitch
So you ain't gon' do shit
I get one for the money
And two for the love
I fuck with weed and lean
But no other drugs
I'll shock these niggas when I take over the world
I'm finna get dome from all of the pretty girls
If you take me lightly
Then you'll try to fight me
But if you ain't delirious
Then you'll take me serious
And I know you hearing this
Watching me get furious
Like I'm Vin Diesel
I'ma get lethal
Pull out my Glock-50
If you come into my city
To become fertilized
And I heard you cry

[Hook: Claude Antonio]
Go stupid, go stupid
Go stupid, yeah
Don't make my niggas
Go stupid, go stupid
Go stupid, yeah
