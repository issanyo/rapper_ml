Intro

Yeah
It's your boy Moneyman
It's 2016 we ain't playing around no more
We're done with the games
Yeah

Verse

Wait a minute wait a minute, let's get one thing fucking straight
I don't care about them niggas, I don't care about their hate
I don't care about their missus, I don't care about their face
All I care about is money cause we're all tryna get paid

All these rappers their in danger, you better call your saviour
Kill them with my pen and paper, I'll do the scene the favour
When I'm done they'll be endangered, underground or major
Fam you get the message, now I'm ringing off your pager

Or should I say pacemaker
Cause fam these niggas hearts are fucking faker, than a Nigerian from Jamaica
Got a girls v on her side just to show her that I'm greater
Uh, the flow's impeccable still sharper than a razor

I don't fuck with you cause your a motherfucking hater
I can't fuck with you cause you ain't fucking with the chasers
I don't fuck with you cause your a motherfucking faker
I can't fuck with you cause your about to meet your maker

I swear these niggas late, I've opened another page
Their still refreshing a page and loading up a new page
Because their scared of a change and sticking to old ways
Triple 9 on the dial, call a doctor for their aid

I'm zooming down an open road, the future me I'm on my way
Fuck these niggas, fuck these niggas, they ain't really getting paid
Get the fuck out of my way, I've got paths I need to pave
Lord have mercy on my grave and the modern day slave

I don't care about these niggas, I don't care about these bitches
I don't care about their riches or useless materialistics
I don't care about their lyrics, I don't care about their physics
I don't care about their business or inaccurate statistics

All I care about is me, friends and fans and family
Music, poker and the science that explains our gravity
And how the universe around us works in certain clarity
I'm giving thanks all to the lord, he did this for humanity

Bridge

I do this for my saviour
I do this for my saviour
Who once was in a manger and blesses us with favours
I do this for my saviour
I do this for my saviour
The one who died up on the cross and resurrected later x2

I'm gone...
