[Intro]

Yeah
How come everybody's always on that dumb shit?
Tell me that
Homie if you're gonna fuckin steal shit from me then you better fuckin man up and tell me it
Not act like a little bitch and put the fuckin blame on me acting like I stole that shit
Fuckin connivin ass fuck

[Verse 1]

Uh!
I've been called down from the heavens
These people told me bless em
But how am I sposed to bless em when these fools keep steppin
I'm like oh my god oh my god
Momma keeps on tellin me baby I need you to get a job
I need money for the bills
Gettin out of debt is like gettin out of depression
Always was addicted to a substance because I would never listen
But I never let the needles and the pins in
Always wore a condom cuz she never let the kids in
I was way too busy cookin dope up in the kitchen
Fuck the pots and the pans my homie
I'm just talkin bout my mother fuckin writtins
But why you talkin shit bitch
Why you gotta sneak diss?
I will give you my fuckin glasses just so you can fuckin see shit
Lord forgive me if I wanna fuckin kill people
I could never fuckin trust em
Sometimes I wish I was up in the streets just so I could bust em

[Outro]
Fuck you
I said
Lord forgive me Lord forgive me
Cuz I had this mother fucker runnin away like his name was Ricky
Cuz freestyles ain't nothin tricky
.
.
.
Told me to man up, I manned up and I didn't see you anywhere
That's alright though
It's all in the past right?
Whatever
It's alright
