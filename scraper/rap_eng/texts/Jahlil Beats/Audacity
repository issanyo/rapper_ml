Yuh, yuh

[Verse 1: Roh]
Walkin' with a Smith and Wesson, teach you a lesson
Put you in the ground, nah, there ain't gon’ be no guessing
Carved my own path, I didn't need any blessings
Been doin' this shit solo, get my name out your mentions
God ain't on my side, nah, y'all ain't on my side, nah
Say y'all down to ride, but y'all ain't really down to ride
Yeah, I'm tired of these fake friends, but thought I'd bide my time
Went and gave them all I had, but now I'm really at my prime
You can't step up on this flow
You can't mess up with this glow
Went and dropped off all these hoes
Now my wrists stay iced with snow
Bitch, don't make me go off on you, swear I'll pull up with the crew
Said I'll make it to the top just so I can see the view
They in it for the money, they in it for the fame
Lied to my face, man, y'all ain't got no shame
Hopped up in the ‘Rari, y'all, don't make me catch a body
I’ma put you in the ground, I don't have to pop a molly
Nah, thought that I was playin', but I'm ridin’ with a tommy
Now you mean nothing to me, I’ma treat you like a zombie
Knew you since the sixth grade, now you actin' like a hoe
Why you fuckin' with that dude who really got no dough?
Go and lie to some other people, all you really know
Yeah, I pulled up rockin' Gucci, you can step off all that though
Make it to the top, I’ma put you on the floor
Bitch, I can do this shit alone, I don't need you anymore
I don't fuck with a lame, zero toleration for a whore
Leave you in the dust, I’ma rock you to your core
Take me for a joke and I'll take it to your fuckin' porch
Gang'll show up with a draco, send yo’ bitch ass to the morgue
Middle finger to the sky, party like I'm gonna die
Said I'm done with you hoe, I got bigger fish to fry
So much money stackin' up I'm bout to go and touch the sky
Expectations going up, I always set ‘em high

[Verse 2: Kid 901]
Yeah, I always said I’m high, but everybody likes to fucking lie
And try to let it slide that I don’t light up every other night
I’m tired of people tryna hide their stripes like tigers in the night
Ain’t no disguises guys, I’m fucking wired to eye, uh
So you can go ahead and put your lighters to the sky
Like as a target, just so I can find a way to hire an ex-sniper
With an iron sight to take your fucking life
‘Cause if I do it myself, I’ll just be playing with a knife, ayy
Now if you think the boy is rolling with the stamina
Just wait until I go pro like a camera
Talk about a perfect shot mixed with a little cannabis
Animal with flammable bars, I’m so intangible
And I got a handful of cars, I’m so mechanical
Tyrannical, America, Canada just can’t handle it
Bananas what I’m going, you dummies going to channel it
I’ve handwritten these poems for canvassing fans like candidates
I get to thinking like “What if I just don’t make it?”
And “What if my shit just stinking?”
And “What if the hooks ain’t clicking?”
I’m sure that I’m overthinking
These words in which I’m imprinting
The spur of a moment brinking
I’m nervous you folks won’t see it
So I’m tryna cut all the low and boring shit
That’s why I’m high as fuck while I’m recording this, motherfucker
