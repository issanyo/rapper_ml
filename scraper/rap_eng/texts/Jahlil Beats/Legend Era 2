[Intro: (Sample)]
Now motherfuckers say you crazy nigga call me crazy
You know I be single when they say that
Niggas say I'm crazy I be thinkin yep
I was crazy enough to believe what the fuck I was saying gonna happen's gonna happen
And that's why I was persistent enough and consistent enough to exist now
It's a parallel between corporate America and the hood and it's obvious
You see me winnin, don't you?
And the fuckin old timers is lookin like
Yo that young boy? he? he took a page out of my book
But they ain't make all of that fuckin money off it that I made off it
So what that make me?
That make me a better version of them niggas
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
We set a new standard for niggas
Ya heard?

[Verse: Jerry]
Black and red Nikes uh
But yall think I'm Mike uh
Shit these niggas trip off we do that in a night uh
First class life uh, made for a fight uh
Great side and I ain't even signed, nigga gangsta
All black suburban, bright chains on Bourbon
If I shine then my niggas shine, that shit's for certain
I've been putting that work in
If I don't grind I don't win
Look at my niggas eyes, we tired, we never sleep, woop
Let me catch that beat, all my niggas got big money dreams
Lots of ambition
If it's money to be made then my niggas gonna get it
Screamin cash ruling everything around me
Legend Era tell them fuck niggas ground me
Chasin llama beams, shit my mama got behind my dreams
And my brother won Jeremy Scotts with diamond wings
You don't know about it, you don't needa know
My bars getting parting gifts like Derek Jeter's hoes nigga
Yea I love these broads but I don't cuff these broads
Man what's mine's is yours
When it rains it pours, shit it's a million more
Got Miami on smash, got New York on smash
Me and Doc on switch, me well gettin paid
Man these hoes ain't shit, if you poppin they on
If you lose yo pocket these bitches dip and they gone
That's the shit they be on, so it's fuck these hoes
And it's fuck these niggas, I just count back rollin
I'm gone
