[Verse 1]

I hop up out of bed; say my prayers like a G
I pray like it’s up to God; I work like it’s up to me
Keeping it sucker free, you can tell by the stance
We ain't in concert if it ain't about the bands
Understand, greatness is all I seek
When you seek success you're sacrificing sleep
Chasing dreams is priceless, sleep's a dime a dozen
But the less I’m seeing of her the more I flirt with her cousin
Death is not a deterrent when you aim to be a legend
Off the strength of my essence you'll piss yourself in my presence, peasants
Flowing like the water in the amazon
I bring life to my region, you other fuckers just babel on
I could care less about the hype he had
The way I kick it man you'd think it was a Nike ad
Sublime skill expected from a professional
Substance over style and my style is impeccable

[Verse 2]

I can't be bothered with harming a doubting Thomas
Like dropping an atomic bomb just to off a dude in an office
Regardless of what they think, I know I'm the fucking best
Y'all gon feel me like the girls that I ain't fucking, yet
No chemistry with lames, we leave you right where we found you
Coz you resonate with each molecule that surrounds you
If a single drop makes a whole pool ripple
Understand why the squad wants nothing to do with you
Seeing through your persona, a wannabe shot caller
Hollering bout your honour but really you're doing nada
Instead of getting caught up pretending to be a baller
Take a shot and make a dollar like Kobe or Malala
See we eating a little with a zeal for more
So we gon' run the town til our heels are sore
Bad bitches pray for designer products like Prada
We just wanna be the ones that they kneel before

[Verse 3]

Straight advice for players who want to play it right
Avoid the hater type, surround yourself with your A-alike
Cats here to master their craft to make a greater life
Don’t let them sell you dreams or you might pay the price
No, you ain’t my nigga if there’s a need to ask it
If it’s ride or die, a lot of you needing caskets
See me doing my business and you bitches act bitter
‘Cause your character’s limited, you twitter ass niggas
Criticised ‘cause I’m after the stacks
But I’m a hustler homie, I just happen to rap
I got designs on being king
If you thought I wasn’t shit you blind or seeing things, fool
Nobody ever survived life
So I’ll only be afraid if I had to die twice
I’mma rake the profits until I’m laid in a coffin
So haters and naysayers can’t say that I never got ‘em, you got it?
