[Verse]
Southbound
On 285!
Neva Switching lanes see that's how we ride!
Drive slow
I'm Never switching sides
I Got that Tunnel vision focused the most high!
Gone and I'm Winning
Off the margin like indents
Said I'm mindin his business, His business mindin my livin!
Seein they got it twisted
All With the wrong motives
Yeah This extra ain't for me Its just my life been overflowing
Hol' up
Hol'up
Rain came from the top down
Who am I to try to stop now?
Umbrellas turned upside down!
Change came betta catch that
Temp fade wit No snap backs!
We put Him on like backpacks
That Light shinin...Can't match that!
P-Put them Brights on
We High beamin it!
Ridin Mr. Clean All White Saleen in it!
And I ain't speakin
Unless I'm meanin it
Changin up the broadcast Mean Gene'n it!
Can't you see that we needin it
Steady itchin I'm pheening it
Bakah Meeting the world
Got the flow of a Mr. Feeni It's...
Time to be professors Get that off the dresser!!
Confessin nothin lesser changing up the weather!
Forecast line up Clear skies!
Born to be a king It's in my bloodline
Lighten up the dark illuminate the sky
Cause He is All I AM! Who the Heck Am I?

[Hook]
Im outta here!
Smash that pedal down to the flow!
Said I'm gone and I'm outta here
So so smash that pedal down to the flow
Said I'm Gone
Light Years Gone
Can't take me out my zone
Its clear to see that we on
I'm never goin back to a time when I didn't know
It's all that I'm on so I'm strong and I'm gone so I'm outta here!


[Verse 2]
So...
Been in Livin Color since the Wayans' Brothers
Jesus is the Truth you'll never find another! (Nah)
I'm not your average human You can call me other!
I gotta be Pharell I said that I am Other!
Put my mother on a vacay!
The Son is comin soon
It's neva been a day late!
Wings out
Music in another stratosphere
Created in His image neva made a man to fear!
We dominate! Time is proper to confiscate
Take it back and we renovate Flashing back and I'm wide awake!
Katy Perry!
I'm On my Genesis!
Acquired the Fire wit No blemishes
Life up In that Garden no pain in sight
Cause everything we need is in that Tree of Life!
Herbal Essence
Its Time to Get it right
So I'm smashing on the gas
Movin outta sight

[Hook]

[Outro]
Look, I said I'm gone and I'm outta here
I said I'm gone and I'm outta here
Gone and I'm outta here
So s-smash that pedal down to the flow!
Said I'm gone and I'm outta here
Said I'm gone and I'm outta here
Said I'm gone and I'm outta here
So s-smash that pedal down to the flow!
