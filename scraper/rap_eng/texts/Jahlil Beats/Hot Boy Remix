[Verse: Jphresh]


I'm about to spend a couple stacks
That VU always be stayin on my back when I spit these bars always have some banger tracks shout out to that Billz  someday we maybe on the maps
Gucci Louis fendi boxes that's from all these  stacks
Throwing all these ones at ya girl she throw it back, goggles flippers it's about to be shark attack yeah you know it's crazy when she throwin right back
I'm bout to dive in it shmurda shmurda it right back bars are so strong hit you like a straight up air attack
My wrist looks like an injury  shiny like ice pack if you touch it Frostbite turns into heart attack like that
Jphresh be blowin' up on yak freshmen to a phresh man yeah we go like that there's ya girl I'm bout to wink at that Jimmy2phresh jus add me on snapchat
Brushing all these haters off like my welcome mat smack it up smack it down booty never flat
Its jus looks like that trunk be extra packed when I wake up I the morning that's where I be at
When I wake up we  hittin' shmoney dance went to wash my hands all I ever see is bands
When ur girl gets on yeah I always have to change my stance
Damier checkers on the  bag that's my first glance blasting waka flocka tonight we do it no hands
I'm bout to come over right now never change them plans this remix goes too hard hopefully it lands from soundcloud to the stage I have several of fans
I'm not even done yet don't turn it off my Mans probably gonna bump this studying for final exams
My name staying out there like it's a local Traffic jam soon be on the radio AM to FM
I'm bout to hop off this track you'll hear from me again  when I drop another remix I will hear amen this song is about to get buzz like the shmoney dance, like the shmoney dance
