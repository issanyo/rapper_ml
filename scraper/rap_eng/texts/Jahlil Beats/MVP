[Intro]
(Basketball Samples)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
They call me the MV ah
They call me the MVP
They call me the MV ah
They call me the MVP

[Verse 1]
They call me the MVP, you can never ever bench me
Slide through your crib when your nigga say it's empty
Feelin' on my arm like he want to be the father
One trip on my arm, and I took 'em like a robber
Hop back in my bag and no this is not no plastic
These are Louboutins got more dough than Papa Johns
I deliver to your head, bury bitches cause they dead
I've been doing it for awhile
Heavy is the crown, but I wear it with ease
All these niggas lactose, actin' scared of this cheese
I'mma run my brakes up till my feet get sore
Every time I come around it's like a news report
You know I'm...

[Hook]
Hotter than a 10 but my neck is on frost
Cuttin' major checks while I'm cuttin' niggas off
In the fast lane where you headed right now?
Where you headed right now?
I'm out here turnin' up while you bitches turn down
Pull up in somethin' sick, make a nigga turn around
You don't want me on that bullshit
You don't want me on that bullshit

[Verse 2]
Runnin' marathons, ain't no time for no timeout
Fifties on the floor, pile high as Amy Winehouse
It's like a movie if I'm ever in the city
I be thumbin' outta handouts, tell 'em bitches stand out
I'm like a senator, always at the register
Seen your bitch around and she always lookin' regular
There is no comparison, borderline embarrassin'
Right before he ate it he say please like a gentleman
Real spill, double sip
That shit got me numb don't care how you feel
You know I got them clips like Bbo
Don't get too ahead cause you know just what I be on

[Hook]
Hotter than a 10 but my neck is on frost
Cuttin' major checks while I'm cuttin' niggas off
In the fast lane where you headed right now?
Where you headed right now?
I'm out here turnin' up while you bitches turn down
Pull up in somethin' sick, make a nigga turn around
You don't want me on that bullshit
You don't want me on that bullshit
