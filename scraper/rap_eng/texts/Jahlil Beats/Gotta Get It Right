Still goin' to work I don't need it
Ain't got no family to feed it

Hard work gotta pay off
That's why I don't even take one day off
All I see is chaos, situation hurts
Like Michael's KO's

That's why I tell ma family to stay close
I told em I may go
Come back with a sack of chedder, Im talkin' Peso

(Bridge)
Yeah let me do this shit

For the kid you love get right so right
