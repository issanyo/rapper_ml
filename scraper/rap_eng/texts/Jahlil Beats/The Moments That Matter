[Verse 1]
The moments we all waited for
Dreaming down on the first, we all paying for
More to be expected and more to get you acquainted on
We all in for the win until the parade is on
We're gone, and the drive is with the roof peeled
The AC on, providing how the truth feels
Cold, chilly chill like our demeanor be
But all of this shit is really about the scenery

Envisioning what the song get us
Feeling like I'm money making Mitch, in the store like I'm broke baby
Forgetting all that I got on, ain't my ropes crazy?
I'm in this bitch looking like I sell dope baby
To these women I sell hope baby
Shit I swear I'm just my daddy all over again
The only one on the block so now we all like him
Tell the money, I want the love, baby I want the love
For all the right reasons that may just be from above
I came up where you see the paper and fall in love
And the only way you got your Mercedes was off of drugs
They put it front and center while I saw around the corner
But the same one was parked around the corner, explains why we...
