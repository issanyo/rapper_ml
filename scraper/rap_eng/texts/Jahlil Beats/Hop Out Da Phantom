[Hook 1: Bok Nero]
(4x) Imma  go cop me a ghost
Imma just hop out da phantom (one day )
Told mama it won't be long
Knew I would hop out da phantom

[Verse 1: Bok Nero]
Told mama Ima be rich (one day)
She gone be living like dis (one day)
Aye look mama yea we made it (one day)
Mapped dat shit out in the basement (one day)
Make it look easy it ain't take (one day)
I work like 24 hours a day

I got my talent, I'm over here grinding
That work that I do overtime in one day

They can't reach my work pace, dey shit come like ye high, show up to ya work place

I just want my money right
Play wit me I'm not that guy
Crack yo head like its a egg
Leave you on the sunny side

I remember eating noodles (one day)
Mix dat shit up made a chi chi (one day)

Knew the only thing we'd drink is Fiji (one day)

Grab The new Ferrari

Des cars push button start it up

White girls say I'm gnarly

Nah dey just want parts of us
In they in they daddy's foreign truck

[Hook 3: Bok Nero]
