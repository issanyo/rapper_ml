[Verse 1: Yung Kevo]
Consider yourself already warned
The rhymes I'm about to spit are very warm
Let me break it down for you like a fraction
No I don't do drama, don't do actin'
I do it for the fam, do it for the fam
Kanye West flow, yeah I'm goin' HAM
Think I really care, i don't give a damn
Dr Seuss, Green eggs & Ham
Feelin' good, Livin life
She On My Side, Nationwide
41 degrees, no Dirk
She'll light it up like some fireworks
I ain't got no type, Sremmlife
Catch me at my street, riding on my bike
Kobe Bryant, Fadeaway
Said she don't like niggas? Get out my face
I milly rock into her dms
Said she got a man, lemme see him
If he big and swole, then you know I'm out
Imma take that L without a doubt
Without a doubt, imma take that L without a doubt
The money turned my Honda to a Rari, I don't take L's like Dacari
