[Intro][x2]
Pull the rolls out and we roll out
Tear the town up when them hoes out
Couple VVS's and a bank roll
Call my girlfriend and she can't roll

[Verse 1]
I done count so much money, I done fuck so many hoes
I done been through many cities, I done done so many shows
He done flipped so many blocks, He done saw so many O's
See that crystal in my rock and you can smell it on my clothes
Bitch I'm a D boy, I'm a hustler
A-1 credit, I fuck with her
Fuck around leave that club with her, every rich nigga in love with her
Can't love her, pop that pussy give it back
Plus my homies put me on, she pop that pussy for some racks

[Hook]
Bitch I'm bout that white, put some butter on the street
And it's outside white, peanut butter on the seat
Every time I'm stepping out, they say "C the fresh is out"
20 bottles on the way, tell em clear my section out
I'm that nigga, bitch I'm that nigga
Ho I ball, I'm that nigga, bitch I'm that nigga
Tell em all, I'm that nigga, bitch I'm that nigga
Ho I ball, I'm that nigga, bitch I'm that nigga
Bitch I got a nice crib, a hot wheel
Hot bitch and hot hills on some high heels
All she do is drank liquor, smoke, and pop pills
She get a check and she blow it all at fox hill
She gotta chill!

[Verse 2]
Man I smoke so much weed, I done saw so many pounds
I done been through minivans, I done been through many towns
Yeah I know so many girls, on that Pac, I get around
I done stuck so many chumps with that Glock like get it down
Get it down, nigga what? fucking chumps I hit em up
Man I put this on my trump, you niggas stunt I give it up
Hit em up, put em down, try to dodge a hundred rounds
I got niggas from the town, put you niggas in the count
Yellow car chenelle, pick that bitch up off the ground
Put some [?] on that [?] if that nigga make a sound
Told em down on my life, move that butter all night
Here we get that thing soft and we cook it hard white, alright

[Hook]
