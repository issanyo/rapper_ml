[Shoutout: Jahlil Beats]
Jungle Beats! Holla at me!

[Hook: Kid Ink]
You can tell I ain't even tryna fit in
Probably somewhere you can't even get in
Don't try, we gon' be here for a minute
And tell em' I ain't livin' till' the late thing finished
I'm loaded, I'm loaded
I'm loaded, I'm loaded
And I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Fo' shots in
And I'm loaded, I'm loaded
I'm loaded, I'm loaded
And I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Where should I begin?
Gotta...

[Verse 1: K.Shawn]
Gotta find it in a drill, my niggers got it, still
Real with the real, my DJ even ill
Ink Call em Will, beats from Jahlil,
Screaming my mind, but ain’t no Johnny Gill
Got it any hard, I pop on any set
I wish a nigga would, I put his life to the test
I made it God’s grace to say I’m turning late
We like jigg, separate make a G
I should go before the sun up, welcome back tutter
Probably fly trotter, fly a litter faller
I’m all about my twat, and there I wanna vet
Stupid say I’m sick, I call it a shit

You can tell I ain't even tryna fit in
Probably somewhere you can't even get in
Don't try, we gon' be here for a minute
And tell em' I ain't livin' till' the late thing finished, shit
I'm loaded, I'm loaded
I'm loaded, I'm loaded
And I'm loaded, I'm loaded
I'm four shots in
And I'm loaded, I'm loaded
I'm loaded, I'm loaded
And I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Where should I begin?

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Knocking down your door like Avon,
Sideline niggers, now we ain’t playing
Ready to go, tell ‘em they don’t have to wait on
See me with the proper hood, niggas like Treyvon
Dope boy fresh, in a dope boy hat,
With a picture perfect bitch, come and get a Kodak
I don’t need a cosign perrier, cotext
Can't stop till' my whole team got a Rolex

I ain't even tryna fit in
Fuck all the politics in the city
Later on they gonna say a nigga get in
Pocket full of hundreds, and I’m feeling like a milli

I'm loaded, I'm loaded

I'm loaded, I'm loaded
And I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Where should I begin?

[Verse 3: HardHead]
I'm in this black air yeezys, straight to Givenchy
Gold chains on racks hanging from my pocket
My whole team's winning, losing never was an option
That's why your bitch's here and leaves with her head popping
I be going in, here we go again, ain't got to ask no question, though
Bottles from out that roof, sparkle right on my whole section
Bitch, you know I am out of marley, probably off a tooth
All black, probably killing scenes where youth
Standing in the line while I'm standing on a sofa
Pussy popping like the paparazzi camera when they saw me
Might not see tomorrow, so tonight I tear the shit closer
Part might feel my boy's caps and a glass of more Patron
