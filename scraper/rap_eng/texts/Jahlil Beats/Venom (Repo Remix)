Nicko:
Verse 1:

I was born in the battlefield
Everytime I spit I cause mental damage
Stay away from me coz thas my can-date advice
I'm rollin' so nice, it's like I'm playing with dice
Fuck with me, plan a funeral coz you gon die
Yeah it's Mr Crazy flow in this beat but my mind ain't right
Yeah, this is me I hustle hard, real hard (x2)
I never think about leaving
Everytime I step behind the mic, I keep on shining
I don't smoke kush but I'm high
When I spit with me you gona..

Doge Tone
Verse 2:

..Call me Doge Tone!
Don' ask for no loan
Crazy 'bout my ex coz she love that fucken pole
Breakin' all woods, fittin in em would be wrong
Please listen to me coz this song is so long
Back to the feet, like I'm bringin more heat
Serving punches for me, so you really need a tip?
