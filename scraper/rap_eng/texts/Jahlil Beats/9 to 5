[Hook 1]

Now I like the way you work it
Baby back up and reverse it
You’re a lady in the streets
But once we hit the sheets you become a different person
9 to 5, I know you working
9 to 5, I see you working
But once you hear the beat
Come and bring that thing to me
Cause it’s practically perfect

[Verse 1]

Good girl, innocent in every facet
Hood girl, you got you a couple assets
Flyest chick on the block, girl you past fresh
Turn around, there’s a spot on my mattress
Your friends say I’m no good, but they don’t know
I got some hidden talents that I won’t show
Go hard I’mma have you wheezing like Cuomo
If you don’t like to do it fast, I’ll bring it down to slow mo
Let your hair down and just let loose
Cause when you rolling with a winner girl you can’t lose
Women or the money, man I can’t choose
Something wrong with me, but girl it ain’t you
You steady bringing home the money girl you on your job
Cause the way you work it, you deserve an applause
Expensive dinner or a walk on the promenade
Just give me any opportunity to show you off

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2] [x2]

I like the way you work it
I like the way you work it
I like the way you work it
I like the way you work it like that
Like that
Don’t run, hun, bring it right back

[Verse 2]

Flawless, you a goddess, honest
All these other girls lost it, you on it
Exotic, let’s fly down to the tropics
You got me choking on my words, need the Heimlich
Give it to me from 9-5 like it’s your occupation
Thought it was money but baby now you’re my motivation
You’re in my mouth, like the topic of the conversation
We’re going south like the places we go on vacation, ay
