[Intro]

Chicago turned me to a monster
Pain turned to me to a monster
Hurting niggas feelings call the doctor
Real emcee you an impostor

Y'all see what D-Money made me do man?
Yeah, every given Monday nigga

[Verse]

Everything I'm rocking vintage
I'm in the lab like a chemist
With these lyrics I be pennin'
Be ending rappers existence
I'm in her grill like a dentist
Fuck your argument and your premise
Greatest out my city period
End of sentence
Body bag every single instrumental
Armed and deadly when I got a pad and pencil
Making reality out of all my dreams nigga
Spit fire, gasoline in my bloodstream nigga
Knife to heart is how I'm killing you, I'm giving you a visual
Bars poison, push your condition beyond critical
Pay me upfront nigga, fuck a residual
You saying you do damage pussy boy, that shit is minimal
It's on every single fucking track that I'm killing you
You got resources but your own niggas ain't feeling you
A blunt nigga so face it, words ain't getting minsed
God took my granny, I ain't been the same nigga since
When you hear Chicago, you expect drill and all that other shit
Never thought I'd spit like this when I was on my Southern shit
Now they need an extinguisher, all this fire I'm coming with
I'm sick, sending out anthrax, like the government
I remember days, backseat of my momma Honda
Now I'm dope like the plug, ain't sold a bag of marijuana
Carrying body bags of rappers, this shit kinda hefty
My girl a BBW, she is oh so sexy
On my Aretha Franklin shit, you niggas gon' respect me
You paying for my Nike only way that you can check me
I got faith in myself, I got confidence in me
Every lyric be so righteous, make an atheist believe
Better than most of these rappers put together
I forgive, my homies don't, they say fuck y'all forever
Get me off the gas? I may be down for whatever
Life been a bitch to me, and I can't wait to catch her
I need every hating dick rider please hop off me
All these flavors, and you chose to be salty
I ain't from Philly, but my punchlines like Rocky
I'll ether a nigga, put his career on ice like hockey
No you cannot stop me, I'm sorry that I'm cocky
Spittin' bars for years, it's nothing new like a swap meat
Probably body anybody, hot nigga, free Bobby
When I get signed, I'm flying my folks to Abu Dhabi
One day I'm like Saddam, next day I'm like Gandhi
Honestly, not a word from you therm niggas bother me
Doing shit on my own
These Chicago rappers is clones
I'll reap every seed sown
And dominate like Jon Jones
See, everything that you drop, fu shit, bores me
You spit assault, I spit murder one, Jason Voorhees
Fuck you, fuck the game, fuck the world, that's an orgy
You can take that shit to the bank, shoutout to Corey
I shoot these lyrics from the hip, everything you say bogus
So in that respect I'm Jimmy Butler, you Keith Bogans
Murdering opponents, since conception I was chosen
I'm kicking the door in, you scary niggas interloping
They shoot for nothing in my city
Turn you to celery for salary
Flow immaculate
Lord forgive me for my blasphemy
Guaranteed going pro like an Alabama athlete
I'm Obi Wan, you padawan, this some rap mastery

Ghost
