[Intro: Rediroc]
APE GANG!
Jahlil Beats; Holla at me!

[Bridge: Rediroc]
Bitch, I'm talking bout that WAM, that WAM
That "Walk Around Money"
Them 20s, them 50s, them 100s, bitch, I'm talking bout that WAM
That WAM, that "Walk Around Money"
Them 20s, them 50s, them 100s, bitch I'm talking bout that WAM

[Chorus: Rediroc]
I feel good, I'm feeling right, my swag on, my money right
My clothes new, my shades black, let me see you dance
Now throw it back
I'm Winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin
I'm Winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin
They hating, they hating, they hating
Cuz I'm winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin

[Verse 1: Rediroc]
I'm winnin, they hatin', this money I'm makin', I'm on that loud
I'm in the matrix. It's Redi, I'm rockin', I'm Guapin'
Her shoes was black, them red on bottoms
This brick that I got, it came wit a stamp
All this chasin' money, it gave me a cramp
Redi, I do it, they say that I can't
Watch me bring that Thunder like Kevin Durant
Now, come and watch a nigga go hard in the paint
Going loco, Coco-Loso be all in my drink
She be bouncin' like a Pogo, she all on my thing
I be shinin', bunch of diamonds be all in my chain
Jahlil on the beat, got the beat full of base
New shoes on my feet, they say I be kickin' that game
I be reppin' that gang, plus that section I claim
It's that 6200, make em remember the name

[Chorus: Rediroc]
I feel good, I'm feeling right, my swag on, my money right
My clothes new, my shades black, let me see you dance
Now throw it back
I'm Winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin
I'm Winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin
They hating, they hating, they hating
Cuz I'm winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin

[Verse 2: Rediroc]
I be talkin' bout that "WAM", let me tell em who I am
By the name of Rediroc, they be sayin' I'm the man
Come and see me, I'm the man wit the million dollar plan
Like my women Puerto Rican but my dinner from Japan
Livin' life without a limit
I'm addicted to money and pretty women
Murder was the case, I killed it, time is money
The Rollie was presidential
Check me out, watch how I break it down
Get your plate baby, we be spreading cake around
Your girl hit me up, she asked me can I take her down
She said I beat it up, I'm Manny Pacquiao

[Chorus: Rediroc]
I feel good, I'm feeling right, my swag on, my money right
My clothes new, my shades black, let me see you dance
Now throw it back
I'm Winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin
I'm Winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin
They hating, they hating, they hating
Cuz I'm winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin

[Bridge: Rediroc]
Bitch, I'm talking bout that WAM, that WAM
That "Walk Around Money"
Them 20s, them 50s, them 100s, bitch, I'm talking bout that WAM
That WAM, that "Walk Around Money"
Them 20s, them 50s, them 100s, bitch I'm talking bout that WAM

[Chorus: Rediroc]
I feel good, I'm feeling right, my swag on, my money right
My clothes new, my shades black, let me see you dance
Now throw it back
I'm Winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin
I'm Winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin
They hating, they hating, they hating
Cuz I'm winnin, I'm winnin, I'm winnin
