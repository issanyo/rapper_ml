[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Ya niggas got me high, yeah
Uh, niggas got me high
Yeah, yeah, I said

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Hey, well that's exactly what a nigga came for
Huh, you throwing shots from afar
I'ma meet you at your front door
Uh, so hard to be doing what you really meant for, beauty
Huh, but don't I make it look easy?
Don't I make it look good? Hey

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Now you drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm 'posed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gonna have to back it up
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
You might never, ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Hey, that’s exactly what lil’ mama paid for, huh
You need to put that out if it really ain’t cash though
Ooh, so hard to be doin' what you really meant for, spread love
Don’t I make it look easy? Don’t I make it look good, hey
Hey, now you smoked up all my weed, come on, what I s'posed to do now?
Lil' baby got way too much ass, come on, you gon' have to back it up
If I get too high, lil' mama for real, I'ma never come down

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Ty Dolla $ign]
You might not ever come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Let me get down

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
You might never, ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
(Yo, ayy, uh)
Uh, as I put this Makaveli in my style
It's ATL-ien, my crib is Mediterranean
Girl, rub that pussy, Instagram me
Put my hammy in them panties, goin' hammy in the Lammy, skrrt
Uh, what’s the topic of discussion?
I be flyin' to the nookie in my hoodie, hit the pussy (icky, icky, icky)
Seven figures like your digits, we can travel off your pivot
Drive Mercedes from your Civic, see me ballin' bitches
You drank up all my liquor, come on, now what I'm 'posed to do now?
Two-oh-one-seven now, bitches, come on, now you gon' have to back it up
I said 3 grams cup, hit it now, sugar, come on, ayy, you might never come down
You might not ever come down

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You might not ever come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Let me get down

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
You might never, ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Interlude: Anderson .Paak]
Yes Lawd
Ayy, Yes Lawd
Hey, what I'm 'posed to do now?
Ayy, you gon' have to back it up
I might never come down

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You might not ever come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Let me get down

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
You might never, ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
You might never, ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
