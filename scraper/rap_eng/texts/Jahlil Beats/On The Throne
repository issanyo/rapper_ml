(Verse 1)
Wanna be sittin' on the throne one day
All niggas gone, I be alone one day
Haters won't move in ma zone one day
On the throne one day get a phone one day
I did it, I did it did it they say I did it
Imma live it, I still be with it they gon' get it
What a feelin I can't believe it what I'm seein
That's meaning of success, imma be it
Some niggas be callin' on ma phone one day
Askin' for a collabo I say No! one day
They be old one day gotta go one day
While I'm sittin' on the throne 24 a day
I be livin', be livin' livin'
The life niggas be dreamin' I keep feedin'
Ma people never ever leavin'
They keep hearin' what I'm feelin'
I'm evil to fake people, I stay scheming

(Hook)
Like a muffucka, I'm sitting on the throne
Like a muffucka Imma stay I never go
Like a muffucka nigga all I wanna do is climb on the top roof
Screamin' down while I'm sittin' on the
Throne, throne throne
I'm sittion on ma throne throne throne
Livin' on ma throne throne throne
Never leave ma throne throne throne

(Verse 2)
I bone like a muffucka, yep Imma muffucka
2 pitbulls watch ma throne as a muffucka
Feel like Snoop Doggy Dog in this muffucka
Kush in the air feel the love in this muffucka
I'm a muffucka errbody muffuckas
No safe babygirl I'm a raw fucker
Everybody trust the law in this muffucka
I treat it like a ho I'm a law fucker
I dont like when niggas playin' muffuckas
They sayin' nuttin' at the end they the muffuckas
They playin' sayin they savin' ma ass
If feds up in here, they wavin' their hands
It's a policy they kno' what to do
If trouble in the front they actin' cool
They act a fool tryna get away
Kinda slick muthafucka but I'mma block the way

(Hook)
Like a muffucka, I'm sitting on the throne
Like a muffucka Imma stay I never go
Like a muffucka nigga all I wanna do is climb on the top roof
Screamin' down while I'm sittin' on the
Throne, throne throne
I'm sittion on ma throne throne throne
Livin' on ma throne throne throne
Never leave ma throne throne throne
(2x)
