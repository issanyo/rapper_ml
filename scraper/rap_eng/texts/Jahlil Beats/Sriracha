[Intro]

[Verse]
The flow hot like Sriracha
Got a bite like a piranha, but I'm smoother than horchata. Voila
I take my mamas like they make them bottles
That bright top with a little bit of red and round right on the bottom
You see a hottie then spot her
Then I'mma eat her out like I be Dahmer. Abu Dhabi dropping bombers
Y'all are meek you're not in common. Not a league im not a god in
Y'all are weak and probably crawling all around in doggie vomit
Like doggie droppings I'm the shit and you are just a turd
Understand, you undermine me I'mma put you under dirt
Underestimated as a hobby now it's fucking work
Hang them with a tie, body bag them with a button shirt
And this ain't just a verse. This a work of art
How you gonna judge my flow now if you ain't heard the start?
You are now at war with a monster out in the perfect dark
In one hand is your head, in the other hand is the Purple Heart
They thanking me for taking people like you off the planet
Existence is a privilege, you gotta wanna have it
Damnit. I'm on my flex zone game
Beating y'all over and over like fucking techno bass
It's that GTFO FOH
Eating these rappers all savage grab me a second plate
Asking Brad for that second chance but me said no thanks
Cuz me demeanor no switching up and me breath no waste
And me debt no paid, so me no play by rules
I'm killing anybody getting in my way like you
Now I stand above rapper blood in a waist-high pool
Ready to make another splash, on this wave I cruise. WAVES

[Hook]
Doing what I, doing doing what I gotta
To leave behind, leave leave behind a saga
Rolling imposters so you know my flow is hotter
I spit it lava out the bottle like Sriracha
