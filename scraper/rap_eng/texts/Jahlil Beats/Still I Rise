[Jinsu]

Still I rise niggas
Thoughts I collect before the stu' where I just hop in this booth and go berserk
Inhaling the finest purp' some ash left on my shirt
Weeded in this bitch to get it and get it since I was birthed
Niggas try to knock me down, sorry bitch it didn't work
Until I'm buried in dirt, I aim to that cheddar first
Hustle state of mind, but sometimes it's a gift and a curse
Sacrifice, knew the worth, saw the plan, made it work
Fuck friends, your own family will do you even worse
You get that money then that power, respect, that comes with cowards
Envy, lead showers aimed to get your head devoured
Small state I came up out of, violence is all they teaching
Niggas get crossed, lives get lost I really seen this
Far as respect, you show it and shall receive it
Fuck with mines, you get blood lost like your ass was anemic
Hating part of the reason they don't want to see you breathing
A young fucking genius, but he'll steam you like the cleaners
I pray through Lord though faggots you know I want it all
I'm standing tall, determined to get my point across
Shit feel the coldest when that bullshit approaching
Fake love all they were showing still I act like I ain't notice
Blood make you related, loyalty makes you fam
So once you biting the hand you one and done you understand?
Talks with my main man to keep my feelings right
Knowing I'd give up anything to have that nigga back up in my life
My phone roaming in the studio stoning
Only L I face is the shit that I'm smoking
They know I go hard, nothing less when I coast the rhythm
And quick to approach a nigga even if his folks is with him
Got newer issues to face, my cousin booked again
Had a baby girl on the way before they took him in
That shit hurt, won't let it show through the tears
Even though I'm knowing I ain't gon' see my nigga for years
I'm falling out with my peers, bitching claiming my kids
Though the Lord is where I stand until I'm in that promise land
I'm sinning like every day, repenting for better days
Outlaw shit, still I rise I, I will never break
Not at all bitch from litigation's and fight some law shit
Never looking towards a forfeit even when it ain't all gorgeous
Niggas ducking enforcements while clocking this money
Stay out the way and stay on it cause locked I ain't trying to get
I'm striving, got a passion need a change in my life
A talent that's gon' go to waste? Nah what the fuck I look like
These industries is bitch niggas and stans
Dick riding fake love for a couple grand looking like some suckers man
I burn an L while your bitch blow me
Bring another chick she get ate from the back like the older Kobe
True story, littest shit that I'm spitting
You speak on the illest it ain't right if a nigga ain't mentioned
You dig it?
