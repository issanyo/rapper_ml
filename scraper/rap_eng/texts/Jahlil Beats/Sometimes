[Hook:]
Sometimes I think about the money
I think about the hurdles and the murders in the game
Sometimes I think about the game
And all the real niggas turn in their freedom for the fame

[Verse I: Yo Gotti]
Sometimes I think about dying, sometime I think about crying
All i do is it ket it real, sometimes I think about lying
Sometimes I think about my nigga in the Fed doing time
Ain't seen his son in 10 years--he can't be doing fine
But still have high spirits; not one single visit
Call my phone, crack a smile,  just to ask me how I'm living
If I tell him I'm doing good, does it make his time harder?
So I say I'm all right, I'm just trying to live until tomorrow
I love my nigga--he could have been a rat
But he chose to be a hundred, so I'm a hundred back
Court date, lawyer paid: now that's what you call love
500 front a 100, now that's a real plug
Sometimes I want to spazz

[Hook:]
Sometimes I think about the money
I think about the hurdles and the murders in the game
Sometimes I think about the game
And all the real niggas turn in their freedom for the fame
