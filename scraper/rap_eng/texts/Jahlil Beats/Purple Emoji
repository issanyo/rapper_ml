Yea, yea yea
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
Let go
Jahlil Beats holla at me

[Verse]
Yea, they ain't talkin' what I'm talkin'
They just spittin' that
I slap your wifey on the ass and throw the dick in there
I throw a party it's gon' be a thousand Crips in there (Crip)
A few Bloods it's all love, we all gettin' it (it's all love)
Them champagne bottles nigga still sippin' that
Infrared on 'em ain't a bullet missin' 'em
My bars make rappers feel as though I'm dissin' them
Shit, and I ain't even mention them
I'm just here to keep 'em uncomfortable
Mention my name I treat 'em like Lunchables
See if I fuck with you I fuck with you but if I don't
Four fifth to your head nigga say I won't (say I won't)
My niggas walk around with broomsticks
That shit you clean the whole room with
On that five thirty in the afternoon shit
Then back a hour later like "I ain't do shit"
I can't cure a fake nigga with a flu shot
But I can cure a snake nigga with a few shots
I resurrected like I'm related to 2Pac
Fresh out the grave dirt still in my tube sock
Bitches keep askin' is that a Aston
Niggas in my pictures fuckin' up my captions
Your bitch brain start slow then she move faster
If she don't move back splat, splat, I'ma blast her
Mine's stock engine your's Flowmasters
Click the turbo then blow past ya
They callin' my phone now but it's no answer
I been sucker free since I been a freelancer
I'm shittin' now, nigga might need Pampers
The streets talkin' since I went grizzly on Panda (grizzly)
I don't care about these bitch niggas
You learn alot about 'em
When you take they bitch, nigga (she mine)
I'm too busy gettin' rich nigga
It's never them, it's just me and my clique nigga
They just tryna get in where they fit nigga
You ain't gotta light my blunt, we lit nigga (we lit)
They see the young O.G. it's OMG
Especially if it's a motherfucker owin' me
My face lookin' like that Purple Emoji
Drag to the dash On niggas know me
They don't wanna see a nigga act wild (Purple Emoji)
They don't wanna see a nigga smile (Purple Emoji)
They don't wanna see me stack paper (Purple Emoji)
This is how we lookin' at them haters (Purple Emoji)
