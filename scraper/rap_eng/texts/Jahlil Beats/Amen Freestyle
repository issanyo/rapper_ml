(Intro: Chubby Jag)
There's a lot of Crip niggas in the building, amen
There's a lot of Blood niggas in the building, amen
There's a lot of ratchet hoes in the building, amen
There's a lot of thug niggas in the building
We make it light up, (yea) like a, we make it light up like a church
(Huh) we make it light up like a church, (Chubby) we make it light up like a church

(Verse 1: Chubby Jag)
Middle finger snapped and my bag already, funny how I got these niggas mad already
You are not that sick, I'd pop that chick
You would never fuck a bitch I'd had already
Before I met Cass, had cash already
Before I turned Chubby, I was Jag already
Can't wait for the day when a nigga get fans, you mean to tell me all that passed already
I don't know who fuck around me and my shit, I go to bed rooted just me and my clip
Two seater whip, with the heat on my right
And my 2Pac back, just me and my bitch
Understand, Comprende?
Squeeze off till it's empty, find out where his kid stay
By the block holmes, calling me Dikembe, Real NBA niggas calling me MJ
I'm still round, cause I've been here
No D round, no hood round
Still yelling out that we in here, If I play here
I'm gon' win here, I got the whip
So I got the chips, I got the fists
Big Poppa shit, I got the licks
So I got the bricks, Holmes
One word and I got the bitch, Chubby yup
Problems with me that K sparking, Roll around with them big faces
I'm talking way before J. Harden, Can't lose
I got chippers on it, good girls
And them strippers on it, I kill tracks
This beat need to be in them trash bags with the zipper on it
Stunt hard when I roll past, Nigga just want that cold cash
That 80's money, that old cash
No young money for my old ass, It's Larsiny it's our year now
Holmes, full speed, them gears down
I'm yelling out amen, Holmes
Gotta thank the Lord that we here now, You beating me
Fuck is you trying, I'm riding out in that coupe flying
Use to smoke like Snoop Dogg, now we smoking up like Snoop Lion
Got a bad bitch, send the most texts, I'm on that pussy
Cold text, fuck everyday
Cause a nigga gotta make up for all the years I got no sex
I'm on now, still I'm so next
In 4 years got no checks, Holmes
Next year if I ain't on that jet, walk around like Coach Rex
Real street, niggas hate then they feel heat
I'm so wrong, I smoke dro, I sell drugs
And I kill beats. Amen
