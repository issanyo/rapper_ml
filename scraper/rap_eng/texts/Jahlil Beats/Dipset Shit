First the Dips go and break up
Now everyday I wake up
Somebody gotta problem wit the boy gettin his cake up
No disrespect is tolerated you could meet ya maker
I’m Kobe (cold B) royalty in purple like the Lakers
Fitted for the crown they told me heavy is the head
Humble but confident bullets the size of a keg
Got a cool diddy bop nuttin wrong wit my leg
It jus look a bit stiff cuz tha shotty in my pants
H&M sweater, wolf fur on the leather, laidback
But I keep that bam bam full of pebbles
All I want is the bag the beef I’m wit it so
Ya partna can get it too second hand smoke
Grown man flow paint it like a Van Gogh
Take ya lid off when I shake it and let the can blow
Ain’t shit sweet ya betta let ya man kno
Shonuff leroy’em wit this damn glow

I’m on my dipset shit
I’m on my dipset shit
I’m Cam’ron fly, Juelz high
I’m on my dipset shit
I’m on my dipset shit
Jim Jones hustling, Freekey musclin
I’m on my dipset shit

I’m purple wasted, can’t drive call an Uber
Yankees hat purple jacket scuffed my purple Supras
I maneuver wit shooters that keep shooters
Get computers putin, brick breakers and block movers
So chump move around, clutching and I’m new in town
Make me add a New Edition betta Cool it now
You seen the glo-up, they hoe up when we show up
The best support is no support don’t show up when I blow up
I’m a 80s baby, you a maybe baby
Pass the lemonade niggas actin shady baby
Wild wit ya Nana, styling for the camera
Guns everywhere like the car came wit hammers

I’m on my dipset shit
I’m on my dipset shit
I'm Jim Jones hustling, Freekey musclin
I’m on my dipset shit
