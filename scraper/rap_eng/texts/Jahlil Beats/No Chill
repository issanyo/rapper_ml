[Intro: Vic Mensa]
(No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill)
Yeah, hooligans
(No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill)
(Warm shit up)

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
I told Sonny warm the beat up, shit is freezin', he ain't got no chill
I ain't got none either, keep a flow right off the heater
To my team I'm Derek Jeter, I got hits, I'm in the field
With a halo on my deal, I signed to Hov, I'm lightskin Jesus
Hallelujah, hallelujah, you do you, more power to ya
I'ma test drive that xDrive, pussy wet it just got baptized
I'm a franchise, you a fraction, niggas broke, can't pay attention
I got drive, she tryin' to screwdrive, guess I got to do it drill
Ayy, we've been up since Friday, gettin' drunk and poppin' seal
Magic stick all on that ass, bitch, I'm David Cop-A-Feel
You a fan, don't it blow you that this shit just hot as hell
I'm with Skrillex and we chillin', but we still ain't got no chill

[Hook]
No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
Hallelujah, hallelujah, I was born ready
But my shooters got shooters, they was born ready
Practice, what the fuck is practice?
What the fuck is practice?
Hallelujah, hallelujah, yeah
But my shooters got shooters, they was born ready

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
On the phone with 'Ye, he on the plane
He say, “What's up, nigga?”
I don't know, not these fuck-niggas
Oh yeah, we was up, nigga
Got the new Beamer on razor blades
Stephen Curry on CP3
You fucked up, won't make the plays
Fuck with us, they make your grave
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but they don't say enough
Problems as deep as my pockets is, my Uzi weigh a ton
I'm a Hyde Park hooligan, you goofy, that's just where I'm from
Choppin' shit like the Karate Kid, not Will and Jada's son
I got SAVEMONEY, they with me now, so go and get you some
Plus my band's old enough
I could fuck with my older sister's friend
Now my niggas try to clown me
When I told 'em they was probably
Same niggas talkin' shit, lookin' shitty, get the bounty

[Hook: Vic Mensa]
No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
Hallelujah, hallelujah, I was born ready
But my shooters got shooters, they was born ready
Practice, what the fuck is practice?
What the fuck is practice?
Hallelujah, hallelujah, yeah
But my shooters got shooters, they was born ready

[Outro: Vic Mensa]
No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
I was born ready (For real)
I was born ready
Don't you know that we for real?
For real
Don't you know that we for real?
Nigga, for real
For real
Nigga, for real
For real
Nigga, for real
