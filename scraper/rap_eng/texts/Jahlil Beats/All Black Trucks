[Intro]
Yeah
Ain't really nothin to it but to do it, nigga
But I'ma show up every mothafucking time nigga, on me

[Hook]
All about my change, never change, yeah
Started from the bottom, then we came up
With that gang shit, now my gang up
All black trucks when we pulling up

All black trucks when we pulling up
All black trucks when we pulling up
With that gang shit, now my gang up
All black trucks when we pulling up

[Verse 1]
Fuck the competition, want em all dead
On the couch, just bust some bottles, me and hard head
Bitches get to sniffin because they know we dope
She take a shot of 'troleum, catch the holy ghost
I'm livin in a moment, let me motorboat
She stick em in my face and slap her face like she Macaulay Cul-kin
Damn I need a key, so I'mma go and post
I'm always on a robo, and I'm a rollin' stone

[Hook]
All about my change, never change, yeah
Started from the bottom, then we came up
With that gang shit, now my gang up
All black trucks when we pulling up

All black trucks when we pulling up
All black trucks when we pulling up
With that gang shit, now my gang up
All black trucks when we pulling up

[Verse 2]
Still up in the Vette, yelling "soouuu"
When they Young M.A., baby "ooouuu"
She ask me where my name, I pull up YouTube
Go hit it at the bottle, baby do "yoouuu"
Had enough the money, never countin backwards
In the air, bein beefy when y'all in Calabasas
I'm shittin' on these niggas, bout to blow a gasket
I'm killin' all these rappers, buy a fuckin' casket
I started dopin' lean and now I need the masses
Or fuckin' Michael Jackson, I need my masters
Putty on em, I'm lookin' like a damn assassin
They worry 'bout me gassin' like I lit some matches
Take that, take that
Nigga, puff flow
Don't get it twisted nigga, cause most my niggas cut dope
My people sell me down, that's what I'm up fo'
Like Milwaukee boy, I'm all about my Bucks (woah!)

[Hook]
All about my change, never change, yeah
Started from the bottom, then we came up
With that gang shit, now my gang up
All black trucks when we pulling up

All black trucks when we pulling up
All black trucks when we pulling up
With that gang shit, now my gang up
All black trucks when we pulling up
