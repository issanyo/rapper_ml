[Intro]
(I'm on LA time. 6am flight.) I figured i put out somethin' 'fore this shit dropped (P2). [?]

[Verse]
My niggas got grams, my bitches got checks
Just counted another hundred, you niggas look stressed
I'ma smoke a pound and break down the rest
Niggas iffy, got my glizzy, I just found a vest
I pray to God that I don't die tonight
We gon' make somebody cry tonight
Them niggas with you, they ain't ridin' right
Ain't got no time to hate on nobody, I got a life
Bitch, I'm on the Forbes list for real
Mazzetti or the Porche just to chill
Honestly, I could have bought niggas deals
Traumatized, I know how a corpse really feel
I stand over your casket, make sure that you gone
We flocked and run in houses when nobody home
If you put out a hit, they gon' copy your song
If you diss me on a record, we follow you home
Uh, what it do? What's goodie?
I ain't got to pull it out, I throw this shit right through my hoodie
I be on the stage with the fully, I got grams all in my pocket, gettin' jail calls from bully
30 side trappin', I'll never forget bush
Cocaine on my side, forever gon' get cooked
Promoter with the Yolla, forever gon' get booked
Kidnapped 'em for that paper, whoever gon' get took
On God, threw my hood up on the freshman cover
Real niggas by me, I can't stand next to suckers
I just found out Gucci got a leather bubble
Go to sleep with my chain on, I need an extra cover
I'm the one in the Lex coupe, jump out in a sweat suit
Hoodie strings tied tight, run up, I'ma stretch you
The plug tried to call me, hung up like, "I'ma text you"
I be on my own shit, I don't care what the rest do
These niggas be cuffin', don't be shocked if they arrest you
Bullets like you goin' scuba diving, get a wetsuit
These niggas be thinking they the best, shit, I'm the best too
Fuck who got the best crew, stand still when the tech move
Drake, you my nigga but this penthouse got the best "views"
Flush out the product then wash my hands like it's a restroom
Ddb wilding like DC styling, that's my best goon
The laws of power teach you don't let 'em know your next move
I'ma motivate the streets if I don't do nothing else
Hit my old bitch, she said, "Young boy, you something else"
I'm here for the money for the cash, I don't want nothing else
Do it for the struggle and all the pain that my mother felt
Now I'll just be blowing money, I just bought another belt
Feds had the block hot, I thought I was gonna melt
I was 17 when I found out how that money felt
Everybody had grams that, shit made me want to sell
I'ma motivate the streets if I don't do nothing else
Hit my old bitch, she said, "Young boy, you something else"
I'm here for the money for the cash, I don't want nothing else
Do it for the struggle and all the pain that my mother felt
Now I just be blowing money, I just bought another belt
Feds had the block hot, I thought I was gonna melt
I was 17 when I found out how that money felt
Everybody had grams, that shit made me want to sell
On God

[Outro]
That shit made me want to sell
Everybody had grams, that shit made me want to sell
I'ma motivate the streets, if I don't do nothing else
Everybody had grams, that shit made me want to sell
