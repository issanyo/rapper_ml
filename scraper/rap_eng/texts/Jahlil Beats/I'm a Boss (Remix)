[Chorus:]
Bitch, I'm a BOSS!
[x2]
I play the shots
I call the cost

We in the bitch'
It's goin' downnnnnn
Yeaa I'm the king
Now where my mu'fuckin' crown?

Bitch I'm a BOSS!
[x6]
I plan the shots
I call the cost

[Verse 3:]
Dim lights, writing to write
Respect deep in my message
Tears, heart, and soul
Hidin' inside every sentence
Yet sill treated and obligated
To be an apprentice
Pressed through in '48
Daily on Dewey wait a correction
Blessin' my assumptions
Bringing down thunder clouds
Hit you with a joint
Broken bones and flesh all around
Break into your marrow
Imperial with my cockiness
Kicking down towers
The cemetry isn't filled
Thrilled from the hardest
Put it in my harvest
Silence is golden
But duct tape is silver
So quick even in winter
Hotter then Mercury
Precise with precision
Strong as your religion
Devoted to one party
Always the underground
See me in the city circle
Don't ask me why I am around
You see skyscrapers
I see ground-grinders
Coming across me
Welcome to my empire

[Chorus:]
Bitch, I'm a BOSS!
[x2]
I play the shots
I call the cost

We in the bitch'
It's goin' downnnnnn
Yeaa I'm the king
Now where my mu'fuckin' crown?

Bitch I'm a BOSS!
[x6]
I plan the shots
I call the cost
