So I was downtown met this girl named Jessica
She look a little old for me but I could probably mess wit' her
5'2" light skin no way she from America
I'm kind of faded so I really just wanna get head from her
Curls gold rose gold watch on her wrist pop
Nose ring and she got a booty shit my jaws dropped
I'm thinking imma get some head and make her jaws drop
And now I'm feeling like a kid up in a candy shop
She from Columbia born out there but then moved to Dego
Asked for her number no conversation no time to play though
I said look up at her how I, I got a tilted head
She said a'ight she gon' home and start getting ready there
An hour passed she ain't pull up to the telly what's popping
I'm with my relly we waiting is yall coming or nothing
She said she sorry she went to fashion valley to shopping
She finna pull up right after and we can get to chopping
I got a handle of Henny bro got a zipper gas
She brought her friend they look drugged as fuck about to shake some ass
They brought their shopping bags too they all from designer stores
So I'm just thinking these bitches must got a lotta cash
She pull out bars and start asking me if I fuck with xans
I'm like fuck it let's do it I'm about to get some ass
Put my chain and cash on the dresser prolly about to smash
Pop 5 xans and then chase it all with the Henny splash
We 40 minutes turning up I started blacking out
Broadie that I'm with is on the bed look like he tapping out
These hoes ain't acting drunk no more the fuck is really happening now
Too slow can't even get out I left my head out
I see these bitches take their shopping bags and start to let out
They put the zip and the cash in the shopping bags and they start to bounce
I'm like the fuck is going on can't even move my mouth
These bitches leaving I ain't doing shit this all went south
I'm bout to pass out I should've never messed with her
I'm off the xans too prolly won't even remember her
Scheming little thotties Y'all done make me burn my temper up
