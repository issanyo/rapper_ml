[Free Verse]
It's twist I'm a cold ninja
'Cause I flick my wrist when I cook dinner
I get so fucking lit when I pop xannies
And I keep a couple bottles up in my pantry
Write a fucking verse up and I spit it real quick
Kick a bitch out when I give her good dick
Spit game tight, you know I got cold bars
Shooting it off like some fucking gold darts
Running through the hoes then I dash out
Ignorant cause I got cash now
Swear to god all do is flex now
And if you ain't about it, get out of my dojo
Stand my fuckin' ground, never back down
Y'all are funny like some fucking wack clowns
Couple gold chains now I need the rap crown
Don't fuck with merp you know he got 2 rounds
