Shinin' Kid eatin' beats for lunch
I'm so starving so I'm eatin' but you're not that much
I'm on The Shinin' path to reach the greatness
And all these haters try to put me into darkness
For me, they're like video games, I walkthrough 'em
Every time I do my shit, they're always all commentin'
Hating is the biggest form of adoration
That's why they pay attention
But it's nothing but a huge motivation
Flow so sick I guess you'll need some theraflu
Im ridin' 'round with my clique, riot to get a view
Next big thing talking
Shine over everything
Ain't under the spotlight so I'mma Shine without anything
Jumpin' on every beat like Super Mario
Poppin' all my opponents like Fernando Alonso
I'm fly in the sky like a superhero
Yo te digo Hasta luego, amigo
Baby mama with a pointed nose, Angry birds
Call of duty Killstreak 9 Haha Blackbird
Yessir
Catch me if you can I'm Tom, you're Jerry
I got the cheese, you got nuttin'
I'm 'bout set it off, yeah show me what you got
Lyrically Incredible, no Nick Cannon
Yeah I'm a phenom, you're scared like I was Venom
I'm the Shinin' Kid so I don't need to turn the lights on!
They're gettin' old-fashioned while I'm gettin' damn hype
I came to shine when I step up, yeah you see the sunlight
Now you blind
Nothing is clear except your mind
She say she follow back.. Haha
Swallow back
Quarterback, hail mary, got it touchdown
I run through haters faster than Eyeshield 21
I made my path, I do it right, you see the light, forget the cash
All haters be quiet cause they know that I'm the one

Lyrically insolent
Tour dates cancel it
I take the first part then the fans leavin'
I ain't complain
I just make it rain
Little freestyle for my homie tho
It's just enough to bang your stereo
Haha to bang your stereo

Shinin' Kid
Gone!
