[Verse 1: Speaker Knockerz]
You run your mouth to much, why can't you keep a secret bitch (Damn)
These niggas lying hell no, I am not believing it (Oh no)
My girl is Spanish all she is is that fajita shit (Eat up)
Gotta new bitch every 3 months I'm on some season shit (Yo Ho)

My diamonds they shining so hard that it look like I dropped a whole key on my wrist (Bling, Bling)
Whole key on my wrist

Scared money don't make no money

[Verse 2: Speaker Knockerz]
Running laps around the mother fucking country (goooo,goooo,go)
Nigga if you ain't talkin' cash why do you bother to bug me
(Why the hell do you bother to bug me nigga)

Crossin' these niggas they tearing
Shoot a hook shot like Larry
Chasing money like Ed, Edd, n Eddy
All I wanna do is count fetti
Stomp a nigga out in my Giuseppe's
Got guns like I'm in the military
Pussy ass nigga I'm ready

[Hook: Romiti]
Scared money (Damn) don't make no money (Count off)
