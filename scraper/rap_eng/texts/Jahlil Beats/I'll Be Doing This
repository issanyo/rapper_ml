[Verse One]
I used to hit up rap shows every couple weekends
2 years before 19 so I had to sneak in
Met Nga we started speaking
Spit for him a 16 and though it was some weak shit

He saw promise and honestly gave me feedback
Told me I had passion for this shit and that we need that
In the game gained some shows next thanks to Casper
Met Ender and its though  him I first learnt to mix and master

After a few months in the scene I met Typo
Who's style seemed like Nas to me poetic with a nice flow
Got him on the bill next event it was a hype show
No clue we'd become tight though but that's the way that life goes

And it goes to show that my life is in hip hop
Spit hot in the booth or on stage when i rip spots
Mase will stay within this race im never taking pit stops
Shit watch what I chose to do when I hit the tip top
While others kick rocks


[Hook]
I'll Be Doing This x4

[Verse Two]
So go check out my catalogue if you ain't heard of me yet
And wait for the next mixtape on the features you gon see vets
Real recognizes real mutual respect
Gotta pay your dues something most new artists neglect

There's a fine line between homage and a mockery
Like scholarship in bars you spit it's knowledge that we've got to see
If your wet behind the ears better learn when not to speak
Cause Vets tend to have punches that can have a baby rocked to sleep

Gotta do your due diligence practice skillmanship
Hense why I devour beats ill never get my fill of this
Like a fat fuck at a all you can eat
Dawning defeat matters not long as you brawl and compete

Always unique on the mic spitting volatile speech
Honestly preach regardless how far the comments will reach
What can I say I'm a true hip hop head
So there's no doubt what I'll do till the day I drop dead
Like I said
