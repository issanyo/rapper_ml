[Chorus: Rediroc]
How bad do you want it nigga?
Bad enough that you would kill for it?
How bad do you want it nigga?
Bad enough that you would die for it?
How bad do you want it bitch?
Bad enough you'll do it a dance for it?
Well, show me how bad you want it
Make a nigga throw some WAM on it
This life ain't nothin' new, these chains ain't nothin new
Motherfucka (?) anyway
So I'ma come through with sumthin new

[Verse 1: Rediroc]
Nothin new, sumthin new
Every time I'm passing through
Rediroc, doing what the trappers do
Take a whole brick and make it crack in two
My nigga Garci down to cop if I ask him to
Bitch, I'm 100 like a 1,000 grams
Drop it in them pots, fry it in them pans
Long weave with a ass jumping out her pants
The way she look, the way she stare, you can tell she dance
You can tell she twerk home, dancing in the mirror
Send it to my phone, you know I wanna see it
Let me see that kitty, you should let me kiss it
I want it bad, so bad, make a nigga kill it!

[Chorus: Rediroc]
How bad do you want it nigga?
Bad enough that you would kill for it?
How bad do you want it nigga?
Bad enough that you would die for it?
How bad do you want it bitch?
Bad enough you'll do it a dance for it?
Well, show me how bad you want it
Make a nigga throw some WAM on it
This life ain't nothin' new, these chains ain't nothin new
Motherfucka (?) anyway
So I'ma come through with sumthin new

[Verse 2: Rediroc]
That shit you doing, really nothin new to me
Looking like a rapper in my jewelry
My plug said he had another 2 for me
Your girl said she be wishing there was 2 of me
Bitch, I'm 100, put me on the scale
Do a 100 years before I ever tell
College girl always gave the best head
She said she miss me so much that she wet the bed
Play wit it baby, don't be scared to touch it
Bend it over, let a real nigga buss it
Then, drop to your knees, let me see you catch it
Swallow every drip and make her hit the exit!

[Chorus: Rediroc]
How bad do you want it nigga?
Bad enough that you would kill for it?
How bad do you want it nigga?
Bad enough that you would die for it?
How bad do you want it bitch?
Bad enough you'll do it a dance for it?
Well, show me how bad you want it
Make a nigga throw some WAM on it
This life ain't nothin' new, these chains ain't nothin new
Motherfucka (?) anyway
So I'ma come through with sumthin new
