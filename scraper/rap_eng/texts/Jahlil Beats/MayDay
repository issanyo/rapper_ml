[Intro]
It's ya boy Guaz
You may not know the name
But you'll definitely know the name
When the track is finished
Hit that shit

[Verse 1]
Hungry for that money guess I want a meal
Got these niggas shocked a brother be too ill
Niggas biting then I got the benadryl
Sick with the flow, bitch I never heal
All I do is kill, on these beats and tracks
I'm a maniac
Yeah I do this shit you niggas new to this
Abort you fetuses
Ain't no beating this, ain't no cheating this
I'ma make the region list you niggas just participants
Voodoo couldn't curse the kid, an atheist would worship
Got that anger bottled up I'm popping like a molotov
Riding on the fucking beat a nigga got that throttle up
Rapping like you had enough
Rap like I ain't eat in months
All these rappers really lunch, light y'all like I'm smoking blunts
Feeling like the fucking man, got no stack but feeling grand
Spitting cracks on all these tracks, nigga this that contraband
Brother slinging on IG we call that shit an Instagram
You rapping for them presidents, I'm rapping for that excellence

[Chorus]
Yeah
I'm rapping for that excellence (excellence)
But I'm still getting hella rich (hella rich)
Y'all rappers still irrelevant (irrelevant)
I'ma kill 'em all hella quick!

[Verse 2]
Work around the clock, nigga am I over time?
Rappers bugging I just put the pest aside
Yeah my rhymes be costing lives, who think they can the price?
Niggas stalling 'cause they lacking drive
Homie better step aside you know this be that homicide
Beating beats I'm so abusive, if I'm on the track then bars included
I ain't busting guns I kill y'all with my music
Saying that you'll do some shit but never do the shit like New Years resolutions
Thinking you a problem then I pack solutions
When I'm in the booth I swear I over do it
I can't wait to get the crown, tell y'all that y'all overdue with it
All that bull shit, I been through with it
Working on my mission, promise I'ma kill it, do it to the fullest
(Yeah)
I'ma fuck the world and get a round two, call that shit a second coming
All these niggas really stunting, but with Guaz they never want it
If they hating then it's fuck 'em, give a fuck about assumptions
I'ma be the best who ever done it
(uh)
People really tweaking if they thinking they can beat this
Have 'em retreating and turning paraplegic
Homie this more then breaching, I'm here for more than four seasons
Ain't nobody defeating this, everybody beneath of this

[Chorus]
Yeah
I'm rapping for that excellence (excellence)
But I'm still getting hella rich (hella rich)
Y'all rappers still irrelevant
I'ma kill 'em all hella quick!

[Verse 3]
Ain't no competition, all these rappers be bitches
Kill 'em just like OJ Simpson and I never show forgiveness
If you in the rap game nigga you my fucking my nemesis
Put my city on my back, watch a nigga bench this shit
Swear I'm bout to tear some shit I'm talking with that recklessness, Bouta kill some lyricist
Everytime I'm on the track I swear I have 'em perishing
Only got a little time y'all better learn cherish it
Motherfucker kiss the ring
Nigga this that MayDay
Rappers better make a way before I pave a way
Looking at these niggas like "who I gotta lay to waste today?"
Word to Makeveli bout to bring the pain
Swear I'm bout to change game
All the others just the same
Ain't no time to contemplate
And I can't let the throne wait
Making mics disintegrate
And aiming for them heavyweights
Know I'm bouta be the great
Let the people hate
If they asking for a name tell 'em that I said
Bitch it Guaz!

[Outro]
I said bitch its Guaz
Bitch its Guaz
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I said bitch its Guaz
Let's Go!
