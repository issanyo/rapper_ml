This is the life

[Verse 1]
Tony killed his own man Ty for a whole brick
Lined him all up and gave him the whole clip
Said he wasn't eatin', he wanted his own shit
And not to mention Ty was fuckin' his old bitch
But Ty wasn't a shooter, that nigga just sold bricks
And Tony he was reckless he never had no picks
Tony was like the Alpo, Ty was the Lil' Rich
Two niggas with a dream that plotted on goin' rich
Started as a team, but Ty he got on quick
Jealousy the reason that Ty got left all stiff
Got Tony at the viewing, Ty mom crying to him
He hug her, he tell her whoever did this, he gone do 'em
From there it was a silence, she ain't condone violence
But they killed her only son so when he said it she just nodded
And he told her that he got her, Grimy at its best
Like Tony had a cold he feelin' slimy in his chest
Yes, he had the nerve to carry the casket
Strapped up before he went he had to carry his ratchet
He nervous, walkin' like he tryna carry him faster
Nigga even grabbed the shovel tried to bury him faster
Next week he at the mall, Rollie on his arm
Two bad bitches with him laughing having a ball
Seen Ty cousin Paul, Paul couldn't believe it
Same nigga asked him for a front last weekend
Walkin' round the mall, Louie on, bags Neiman
With the gold diggin bitches Little Ke and Bad Trina
He dapped Tony up, tryna cap Tony up
In his head thinkin' how he gone clap Tony up
But Tony he ain't worried, cause he strapped Tony up
Seven days of running he already turned it up
He got Pauly burnin up, he ready to ride
He know Tony a killer but he ready to die
Ahhhhh, smell the death all in the air
Pauly thinkin' bout puttin' a check all on his head, but he can't
Cause Tony he done killed his first cousin
If he let somebody else do it it won't mean nothin'
He wanna' see him bleedin', he wanna see him gaspin'
Wanna' watch him die slow, like he sufferin' from cancer
Feel that Tony did it but he don't really know the answer
So he gone let it burn until he get confirmed
Couple months fly by, Tony on the high rise
Started flippin now he got them chickens in like Popeye
Pauly still gettin' it, always been a top guy
He ain't really club but tonight, he gone stop by
Seen Little Ke and them, it was two or three of them
Standin' in the line he said "I'mma pay for me and them"
Pulled his money out, started countin' it and teasin' 'em
You know Ke gold diggin' ass just wanna' be with him
Slid up in the club told the waiter "Give me three of 'em"
Bottles of the spade, now Ke just wanna leave with him
He said "Where yo phone at", she said "Where you goin' at?"
He said "I'mma slide out," she said "I'mma ride out"
Told her friends "call ya'll tomorrow when I get to my mom house"
They got right up out of there, took her to his side house
Soon as they got in the crib, she just blew his mind out
Wasted off them bottles Pauly bought she on her nod out
But Pauly he ain't goin to sleep
Grab her phone up off the sheets
Took it to the living room, her messages he goin through
Scroll up to Tony name, he text her "What you doin' boo"
She text him back "I'm in the crib" he text her back "you comin' through?"
She text "where I'm comin' to?" he text back
"1022, Woodstock in North Philly, take the E-Way to the zoo"
She said that "I'm comin' now", look-e here what Pauly found
Got the drop on Tony where he living and its goin' down
Couple weeks later Pauly on Woodstock
Sittin' in the minivan, tinted with his hood cocked
Tony just rode up, Pauly got the good drop
.44 in his hand bout to make the hood rock
Tony slippin', Pauly all dippin'
Walkd' up on his car like "What's poppin' lil' nigga"
Tony lookin' shocked, his Glock was in his box
So he couldn't grab for it, Paul said "That's yo' ass boy"
He said "you still need that work that you asked for?"
Dropped it all on his lap it was four and a half raw
Tony he lookin' crazy he know that's his last straw
And Pauly just let it go, put his brains on the dashboard
POW!
