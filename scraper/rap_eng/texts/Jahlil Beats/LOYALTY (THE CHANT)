Hook: LOYALTY (4x)

Verse 1:
A lot of niggas get on and act like they forget about you
If you was loyal to me I make sure I stick around you
Cause loyalty's everything, Family don't mean shit without it
That water run everywhere, Blood it stay thick as mollasses
A lot of niggas get boxed and I ain't talking Cassius
Talking about caskets, damn shit get tragic
So I'm riding with my niggas like we was up in traffic
Got this 'matic, never double clutch, hit them up let them have it (BOOM!)

LOYALTY (4x)

Verse 2:
Back then you ain't show me love
You fucked up
Now you only want me for your buzz
Thats fucked up (thats how you feel?)
Now a days it's hard to fall in love
I can't trust (never that)
So I just do it for the family now
Its just us (hahaha)
(Its just) Its just different, I want it I get it
Ain't no hating at this table if we get it we split it
Division (break bread with your brothers man)
Pages of paper ain't talking no scriptures
Addition (Run it up)
We add it up, subtract the hate they made at us
You get a chance don't pass it up
We number 1 we glad it's us
But we never let the paper separate the fam
Never let a hater ever make you mad (bums)
They your favorite fans
Never count it way too fast/Cultivate the cash (Run it up)
The world in the palm of your hands/ You just gotta grasp
Look, never let the enemies divide the troops
And if they cross that line you better rise and shoot
Don't shake inside your boots (BOOM)
Just do what you gotta do to make your mama proud
Get your girl and your mama out thats the soldier that I salute (Shoutout to Siq)

Hook: LOYALTY (4x)

And I keep it a hunnit like down to the oils
You gotta stand up, never knees in the soil (never knees in the dirt man)
Cause you only live once, So you gotta stay loyal
To the man up above you and the people that support you (Love you God)
When my brother lost his mom, I almost lost my mind
Just thinking bout all the time (thinking bout all the times)
Just thinking bout all the shit that I be taking for granted
And when it come down to it, nigga money is time (Run it up/nigga get the money)
I mean, time is money and niggas is money hungry

Chorus:
So I been on my grind 24/7/365
And they hitting my line but half the time I don't respond
I'm just living my life, its loyalty all on this side
I'm just living my life, cause loyalty is hard to find
I'm just living my life, its loyalty all on this side
And they hitting my line but half the time I don't respond
Im just living my life, its loyalty all on this side
Im just living my life, I cross my heart and hope to God
