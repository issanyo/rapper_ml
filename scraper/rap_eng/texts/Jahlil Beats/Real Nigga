[Verse 1: Jahlil Beats]
Get-getting money, fuck fake shit
Got yo main ho with me tryna take this
You're lame, nigga face it
I'm just getting to the money while I'm ridin in the spaceship
Bad-bad-bad bitches in my bedroom
Baby call that shit the head room
Big coup cuz a nigga need leg room
Killin these niggas, all the haters will be dead soon
Yo-yo-young nigga, I'm too hot
Man my wrists so sick, nigga you stop
I'm the man round here, nigga you not
All my shit crack, new rock
Uh, told a bitch a bitch make make it clap
Baby clap and them bands I'mma make it snap
Dope nigga and this money I'mma make it stack
Told a bitch shake yo ass then you throw it whack

[Hook: Jahlil Beats]
Bitch you fuckin with a real nigga, real nigga
Real nigga, real nigga

[Verse 2: Jinsu]
Real nigga word to me
I fuck bad bitches, cash getting, addicted to fast livin
All that hatin shit ain't hurtin me
Try to act, nigga mack hit you just like the last nigga
From the east coast but in the west a nigga chillin
Hey Graystone have that bitch coming down the ceiling
We make a move, no camera crew to see how I'm livin
She on her knees like she prayin, forgive her for sinning
I'm in that 2 door Skywalker down, sippin on Pluto
They sneak dissin, I'm sneak fuckin but a chick that you know
I got a white bitch with a bum, call her Juno
See on the red side, near Boss, call it Hugo
You on that fake shit? I ain't tryna build wit ya
You niggas trickin, this conversation would still get her
Stay loaded up, fly shit, my pale nigga
You want beef? West side, let's make a meal nigga
End with the games boy, I do this shit for real
Keep it 2G, 20 hundrid dollar bills
We go down and represent the illest, in it how I feel nigga
Dups in my youngs to get ya

[Hook: Jahlil Beats]
Bitch you fuckin with a real nigga, real nigga
Real nigga, real nigga
Bitch you fuckin with a real nigga, real nigga
Real nigga, real nigga
Bitch you fuckin with a real nigga, real nigga
Real nigga, real nigga
Bitch you fuckin with a real nigga, real nigga
Real nigga, real nigga
