[Verse 1 – Kid Ink]
Don’t be a no show
You came all this way just to sit on your ass
Nah, we going loco in my section
Girlfriend missing, you ain’t even got to ask where she at
Gimme that, tryna act like she don’t know how to dance
Bet I throw a dollar, guarantee she throw it back, throw it back
Ok alright, said it’s Batgang in here, up all night
It’s a war with the shots, tryna earn my stripes
If you see a bad bitch on sight, let me know

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – King Los]
Ok, I got a bad white bitch with a rich daddy
She love to twerk it on my dick and call me big daddy
I got a ghetto bitch, she tryna hit a lick
I think she sweet, but she twisted like a licorice
Hold up, I can talk it and walk it
Keep the racks on me like a walk in closet
You see the sneaker, man it’s a killer
All my kicks snappy like Anderson Silva
Ok, I told her pimp it and pop it and wobble it and dip it and drop it (like it’s hot)
I said bitch I ain’t Pharell, you better (drop it like a thot)
You better (drop it like a thot)
Chop it like a rock, pop it like chopper (brrrt)
Mama cock it like a Glock
I keep OG in your swisher, I keep Rosé in your glass
Girl it’s something special bout you, hold up, ok it’s your ass
Yo Ink, we gon get these bitches everything they like
If you see a bad bitch on sight, let me know

[Verse 3 – Shitty Montana]
I’m asking where the racks at, Imma smash that
Cause I be throwing racks yeah, at the ratchet
In the trap serving gas back, smoking Backs yeah
And this molly got me turnt, man I’m to the max, yeah
I’m a real gang member, yeah I’m six figure, yeah
Sosa [?] hitter, yeah the forty [?] man
You looking for the bricks, yeah I got the killer gram
On the low in my hood, niggas calling me the man
In the gang of new hot boys, I will drop boys
Ink went platinum, so look at the top for us
In the club going crazy, and I caught a thot charge
Racks where they at, man I got a lot for em
