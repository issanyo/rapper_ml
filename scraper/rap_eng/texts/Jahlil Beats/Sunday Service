[Intro]
Yeah, We in the house of the Lord now nigga, Sunday Service

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm back with the rhymes like I'm Dr Sues
Yeah They may be funny but I'm spittin' the truth
Y'all niggas is kittens I'm a Sabre tooth
I got all the answers like my name is Yahoo
Couple hoe ass niggas keep sayin' I'm fat
But I still get the honeys you better believe that
Fucked so much pussy that I'm part cat
Man fuck a condom all I know is bareback


[Hook]
JonnyRighteous in the building Nigga amen
Say a prayer for these niggas hatin' amen
I'm like Bond villain cause I stay scheming
Fuck these hoes round the clock nigga Big Ben

[Verse 2]
I swear being this good should be a sin
Similar to Nilo dating the Crimson Chin
Looking like a bull with that septum ring
Who the fuck is Bruce? nigga go ask him

[Interlude]
Lord give us this day our daily bread,but not that Kingsmill not that Hovis no i'm talking about that Queen's head nigga yeah yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah my eyes may be googly but your girl tried to move to me
It was love at first sight when she first tried to Google me
Call me Reverend Righteous cause the flow be so Holy
Got a spot in Heaven cause me and Jesus are homies
Shoaib firin' shots at me, I don't know how
When the patches on his face makes him look like a cow
I'm one asking those questions on Ask.fm
I'm just having fun I don't try to offend
These ridiculous rumours seem to have no end
That Transformers porn joke is running dry
But I ain't stressing and I'll tell you why
Cause My rap game is strong and I don't have to try


[Hook]

I heard a rumour and I wanna ask
Is it true, Emeka that you eat that ass ?
Eatin' on that ass is how break your fast
Nigga There's no doubt that you got shit out your mouth

[Outro]
JonnyRighteous, Sunday Service, gonna let this one ride and I'm out!
