[Intro: Rediroc]
Back to the TRAP. Back to the, back to the
Back to the TRAP

[Bridge: Rediroc] (2x)
4.5'll get you in the game
Anything less, is a got damn shame

[Chorus: Rediroc] (6x)
Cooking in the kitchen

[Verse 1: Garci]
Aye, I'm cooking in the kitchen, I'm Tony Montana living
Pulling up in them 6s, I'm fucking these niggas' bitches
Put it all in the pot, it swim away with them fishes
Put it all on the block and watch it fly with the Pigeons
I'm (?) Yayo, talking Boston George
You nigga's is just Diego, I'll fuck a round and let a "K" go
Boy looking bad, might put him on the payroll
He looking over here but we full off of cake though
Huh? I'm talking way before the fellas
A nigga (?) before he did all of that telling
We've been pulling up in Foreigns before we pulled up in that "7"
I'm dancing all in the Kitchen, I'm rock-n-rolling; I'm Elvis
A 4.5 at least will get you in the game
And, anything less is just a got damn shame
I got my first brick and then I bought my first chain
I'm on Airplane mode, all my niggas' doing the same

[Bridge: Rediroc] (2x)
4.5'll get you in the game
Anything less, is a got damn shame

[Chorus: Rediroc]
Cooking in the kitchen (2x)

[Verse 2: Rediroc]
Rediroc, bitch, I got famous from getting my trapping on
In the kitchen, right at the table, ripping the wrapper off
Get the scale, double check numbers and then we drop it in
Pull it out, bag it up, tell them niggas' "we got it here"
No lie, used to get my work from out the bad lands
Big fat Puerto Rican nigga; had the black Van
I copped 2, he threw me 1; never gave me bad grams
Had a good run but the nigga in the FEDS now
Rubber-band round the WAM, that's a Chicken Wrap
Took a loss, hit it with the soda, had to get it back
Took a loss, hit it with the soda, that'll get them fat
Garci got me Bugatti dreaming, gotta get me that
Gotta get me that, all about the benjamins
Coke out of Williamsport, crack down in Wilmington
Meet me at the checkpoint, it's more, I'll deliver them
Niggas' talking work but we the ones really living it

[Bridge: Rediroc] (2x)
4.5'll get you in the game
Anything less, is a got damn shame

[Chorus: Rediroc]
Cooking in the kitchen (2x)
