[Verse 1]
I'm going hard, you's fallin off
20 racks off in my pocket, bitch I'm showin off
I'm getting money, you took a loss
Young nigga getting to it, nigga I'm a boss
Rubies on my face, Rollie on my wrist
See a bad bitch with me, nigga I'm the shit
I'm really poppin, I'm so fuckin sick
Plus it ain't about nothing, I can fuck yo chick
You niggas watchin, I see you niggas
And to tell the truth I wouldn't want to be you niggas
Ask around the town, we like the Beatles nigga
Black diamonds on my neck, don chido nigga
And we gotta talk about it, nigga I'm the truth
I get it in another zone when I'm in the coup
I can fuck her for a hour when I'm off the goose
She gon suck a nigga dick and then I'm letting loose

[Verse 2]
I'm in the game, you watchin nigga
Bitch I'm comin up and you can't stop me nigga
Man you niggas hatin tryna block a nigga
Cause I'm getting cake, Betty Crocker nigga
7's on my waist, J's on my feet
Bitch I'm ballin on these lame niggas every week
Just getting started, I ain't reached the peak
You ain't never getting on cuz your shit is weak
Look at me nigga, I'm the fuckin man
All you niggas wanna beat up, talkin 50 grand
You ain't talkin money, I don't understand
I ain't tryna talk unless you try to spend them bands
Nigga Legends is the team and I'm my brother's keeper
I'm the nigga with the shit that's blowing out yo speakers
Bitch you'd fuck me, right? then shawty's a keeper
I take em to church and I'm the fuckin preacher
