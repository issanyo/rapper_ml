Ey nigga what u doin' man, put that shit right back in man... muffucka, don't ever take it back man...

(Doorman)
Eh, what u doin there?

(Verse 1)
I wanna go, right through the door
I see anacondas on the floor
A deer and a doe, a G n a hoe
It's the jungle party let's go
Let's get on the couch I wanna have a drink
Can I have Vodka black as ink
But they got me pink, don't care what I think
She said "it's the jungle party" with a blink
So I turned to the left and then to the right
The conversation turnin' into a fight
So we got up quick, got on with the trip
In the next floor them niggas shoot a flick
With a lotta girls, a lotta lotta girls
A lotta hot girls, and hotta hotta girls
Nigga I'm trippin', take off ma glasses
Look at these legs, look at those asses

(Hook)
Jungle party, it's the jungle party
Shawty get me one mo bacardi
Jungle party, Jungle party
Shawty get me one mo bacardi
(2x)

(Verse 2)
You can have it your way, everybody kno' what I say
Them freaky ladies want me to play
They got vines in it, hangin' on the ceiling
Swingin on them like I'm lookin for jane they see me
Fightin with a leopard, Tarzan style
See a bitch barge in with a gun, all men down
Kinda dangerous these people actin like apes
Bathin in a lake drinkin' unpressed grapes
All movin, right to the left, left to the right
Jump to the front back then to side
Everybody kno' wuzzup
That shawty like "Yo Wuzzup?"
I say "Hoe Wuzzup"
She took me to a cabinet
Lock me in the cabinet
Pull it down, fucked me in the cabinet
Asked me if I'm lovin' it
Wanted me to rubbin' it
So I did it ma way
She started to vomit it out!
(Vomit sound)

(Hook)
Jungle party, it's the jungle party
Shawty get me one mo bacardi
Jungle party, Jungle party
Shawty get me one mo bacardi
(2x)

Go babygirl go
Go and do that anaconda on the floor
Now let me see you go
Babygirl go
Let me see that anaconda on the floor
I say let's go errbody let's go
Let's do the anaconda on the floor
Go, go
Anaconda, oh..

Damn... Damn...
