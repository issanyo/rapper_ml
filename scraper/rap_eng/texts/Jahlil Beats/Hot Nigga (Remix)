[Intro]
Man, they been patiently waiting for my comeback
Minor setback major comeback
Ya'll been freestyling on this shit but ya'll ain't body it right
Let's talk bout' what you not nigga
Suu!

[Verse 1]
Ok let's talk bout what you not nigga
Not a rapper not a thug think you Pac nigga?
Not a shooter, you don't be on the block nigga
Now let's talk bout what you are, you a op nigga
Real G'z move in silence you a hot nigga
Niggas snitchin' now it's sirens on the block nigga
Don't you ever come around me if you hot nigga
I think they plottin' on me so I gotta watch niggas
First it's Jackpot, now it's Hot Nigga
These fake thug rappers thinkin' that they Pac nigga
I'm not a house nigga or a block nigga
Far Rock nigga call me Suu Rock nigga

[Verse 2]
They don't see me coming tell em' put they glasses on
Cuz I be catchin' bodies every single track I'm on
Once I give em' a little they wanna ask for more
You niggas broke 20 in ya pocket just like Macklemore
All these girls just hold me up, I want a girl to hold me down
I'm tryna get this money fast, all these girls just slow me down
I had some girls that switched on me
Now me and them is history
That means they don't mean shit to me
I'm sick that's why they sick of me

[Verse 3]
Hold up, let me calm down
Ight good, I'm calm now
Free now, it's on now
Young Joc it's going down
Libation gets poured down
My step pops he gone now
Mama stayed strong, she ain't let them tears fall down
Once I seen Him in the casket had to let them fall down
I'm strong nigga, you wrong nigga
You know you fucked with the wrong nigga
I'ma let The Lord get em'
No time for bullshittin'
This nigga Taylor Ervin he really just false snitchin'
Who the fuck is Taylor Ervin never heard of him
If I was a different type of person then I'd murder him
Have some niggas walkin' thru his hood like we in Ferguson
Snitch nigga lying to the courts, the nerve of him


[Hook]
Released on bail just a month ago
Taylor Ervin snitchin' I'ma leave him though
Karma coming for his ass, he don't even know
Fresh out on bail just a month ago

[Outro]
Just a month ago (x2)
Released on bail just a month ago
Taylor Ervin snitchin' I'ma leave him though
