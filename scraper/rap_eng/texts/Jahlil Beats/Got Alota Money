[Intro: Lore'l]
Take money, money, take money, money, take it
Yeah, uh, Lore'l

[Verse 1: Lore'l]
Kush'd out on a red eye, real good sex make the time fly
Give me high five, light skin size
Put the chicken in the box like I'm Popeyes'
No fries, got a flat tummy, he give me good head
I give him better yummy, she a (?) crash dummy
Lore' Maguire; show me the money
Cash rules, break law, big banks; no draws
All my niggas least got 4 cars, they ain't just balling bitch
They all-stars
Dropping jaws, as I pull up in a double R, 2 G's on my feet
You know I ain't walking far
They all in all, I like my beef; Kobe, I don't fuck Lamar's

[Chorus: Lore'l] (2x)
Like dope boys, wit a lot of money
You a broke boy? Fuck away from me
You a broke bitch? You a damn dummy
Where my dope boys? Get alotta money

[Verse 2: Lore'l]
Dumb hoe, be glad I'm hot
She ain't talking that shit, that's suicide
Do or die, fucking washed up, you ain't using Tide?
You can't be a bad bitch asking for a ride
Days of our lives, fuck nigga better roll up while I drive
Chanel number 5, put it on me, on the real tip, trick
You don't know me
She fucked the homies, and the homie's homies
And the homie's homie's and then they're homie's homies
Talking bout she Ginuwine, wanna hear Pony
I got a million niggas thinking I'm their one and only
Too bad, niggas bitches, skinny jeans it's the new drag
I offend a lot of people, I don't use "Fag"
We walk around Neimans and he hold my bags
Fucking bags

[Chorus: Lore'l] (2x)
Like dope boys, wit a lot of money
You a broke boy? Fuck away from me
You a broke bitch? You a damn dummy
Where my dope boys? Get alotta money
