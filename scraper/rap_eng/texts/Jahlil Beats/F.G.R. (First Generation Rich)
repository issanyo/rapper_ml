[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Hopefully living in the 'W' like I'm here on business
Cause for the win I'm leaving everyone to here to witness
But then again I'm seeing everyone in here with visions
They too vivid so I'm here till no one here is living
The way I ease up and dig her out we up and get em down
Gotta lean witnesses cause my sneakers be sticking out
Why leave em to pick me out, in it before it starts
Ripping the floor apart, then we be out
Call it 'Inheritance' part 2
Inherited off stoops
Got up off of them to see what the rest of the heart do
I'm leaving scenes without a speaker left
No one here to speak a breath
My bitch be a Vivica, bag right, squeeze her left
I mean we ain't living up, flash lights, we be next
D's be running up and down my ave like a CVS
Promise all I want it to be promised this is worth it
Couple rags duffel bags ain't no reason we ain't working
Couple rags duffel bags shorty be it from the surface
Telling me she up for that like hopefully it be a Birkin
And now she singing murder deals trying to murder heels
Pray before we spray them and hope they work for real
Call it F.G.R

[Hook: Skyzoo]
First Generation Rich
Hands digging in this bag trying to make it stick
F.G.R., First Generation Rich
I be the first and the last if I can stay with this, F.G.R
We all trying to get it (x3) like really who you kidding?
We all trying to get it (x3) and hit the floor with it
And call it F.G.R
We all trying to get it (x3) like really who you kidding?
We all trying to get it (x3) and hit the floor with it
And call it F.G.R

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
As much as I wanted to be Theo
My day ones was more J.J
And I'm from out of Brooklyn like I'm Dwayne Wayne or like Theo
But my focus became about payday
So we on the same page
We reading the same line
And I'm trying to change a page
But she trying to take her time
Like baby if they got a surveillance then I should be at a 10
Let em see a bad bitch before I squeeze in the lanes
Love her, black glover, bra big, waist small
Draw attention and get to drawing away starve
And may y'all be in ya best grace
Or be by the next safe while we screaming checkmate
Check mate, and checks may need IDs, so cash us
Swear that I don't mean no harm or close caskets
But this is integrity as been at a level 3
So now I'm trying to lower something down respectfully
Respect what the money is, trying detail where the money was
And own the keys from where the money is
Pillow talking to a pillow
Knowing it needs to happen but none of it probably will though
Call is F.G.R
