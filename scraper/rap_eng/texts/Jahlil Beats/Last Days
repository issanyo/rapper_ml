[Verse 1]
Sometime I be rolling thinking my last days
Sometimes I be getting money the bad way
50 told me ski masks gon' be the fast way
If I get caught and do a bid what would my dad say?
Would he be pissed and put some money in my [?]
Or throw some flowers if I end up in that cemetery
Questions I ask strict
I have a son and leave this Earth then he a bad [?] and grow u to be bad as shit
My baby mother gon' be out messing with other niggas
And have a kid from one that really wasn't fucking with her
My time [?] with these birds so I don't fuck with Twitter
These are the things I think about here goes my vivid picture
While niggas was hesitating waiting to see the plan
I was living in Pennsylvania went to Rhode Island on Peter Pan
Too busy up in them streets, I barely seen my fam
My grandmother worried like "oh here we go this shit again"
Nana still love me though, [?] still hugged me close
Mama care about me, no she don't she left me in the cold
Daddy still ride with me, know I still see the love
When the streets was rough I had the heater tucked
Now I'mm first class and my feet is up
Figure why they call it stress
Though I'm too blessed to be stressed, getting this off of my chest
I wonder if I'm working hard and getting money for my last pay
Praying to God, cause tomorrow could be my last day

[Hook]
When it falls and the days grow quicker
Still stacking my figures, be the same lil nigga
I ain't worried about nothing nigga I'ma do me
This is how I'm gon' eat, that's the way it's gon' be so I be
My fast pace fuck with my past state
Lit cigars flick the ash strays to pass day
Until my last days, my last days, until my last days

[Verse 2]
See in my hood they know what's up and already know hat I've been about
I ain't slipping out, I be chilling out
If it's war time then them killers out
Done seen it all been through it all
Still going through the same shit
Rearrange shit when that pay it
Tightest circle with niggas I hang with
You be that frail shit, I'd rather keep it real
You claim you making moves, but how if you're standing still?
Don't give a fuck about you or you lame hoes
When the stakes low, I became pro
Getting pesos, y'all [?] hoes
Time to see the truth if it's in you then you gon' do
What the hell you got to do, you ain't stopping go on make your move
This dedicated to you, realness coming from me
Actually it's for the both of us, to the top we gon' be
And that's real

[Hook]
