[Intro]
"When I was your age, they would say we can become cops or criminals. Today, what I am saying is this: When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?

Jahlil Beats; Holla at me

[Chorus: Rediroc]
I'ma tell them one thing about me
Let me tell them one thing about me
They need to know one thing about me
If it ain't about money then it ain't about me

[Verse 1: Rediroc]
I'm on the road to the riches and the diamond rings
Trap hard for my piece of the finer things
All kind of bling, throwback designer frames
Whole lot of "WAM" stuffed in my designer jeans
No "I" in team, consider us the Mob
With the double stuffed magazines; preparing for the war
Weighing up the raw, and I'm weighing them in 4s
First come first served if you're aiming for a score
Come and jump in the water where the sharks swim
Great whites make tuna out of Dolphins
Dead presi's getting buried in the coffin
Married the game in the Rollie was my offspring
I could pull a Halle Berry on my off day, that's all day
Swag champ, that's all day. That's all day
Patent leathers; they all gray
Another hater just died, let us all pray
Now watch how I rack up the 100s
Drinking Sangria, eating catfish Nuggets
Get on my level, VS's sit in the bezel
Ape Gang, give them hell until we sit with the Devil
You heard me?

[Chorus: Rediroc]
I'ma tell them one thing about me
Let me tell them one thing about me
They need to know one thing about me
If it ain't about money then it ain't about me

[Talking: Rediroc]
Yeah..One more though, one more

[Verse 2: Rediroc]
Yeah. Look, I light up like the 7th month; 4th night
More money, more problems, more white
Black lenses blocking haters, I got poor sight
I like the pretty thin waist and the whore type
Exactly like that girl that you love the most
She say she love it when I drill her and I hold her throat
These ain't fucking bread crumbs when I'm throwing toast
You know the saying "don't fix it if it wasn't broke"
Tryna reach America's pinnacle
Split a "36" and I sell them individual
Till' I'm cool and my whip is a miracle
I'm talking Bachs, where the driver get (?) for you
Rediroc, slick rick, minus the eye patch
With a chain representing where I grind at
I know a bunch of lunatics with them 9s strapped
And keep money where their mind at
I find that, it's now or never cuz you can't rewind time back
I'm on a movie, I'm flying out and flying back
No script, I live a movie that's on IMAX
Co-starring Salma Hayak
Hahahahaha

[Chorus: Rediroc]
I'ma tell them one thing about me
Let me tell them one thing about me
They need to know one thing about me
If it ain't about money then it ain't about me
