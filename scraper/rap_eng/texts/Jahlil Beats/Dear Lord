[Verse 1 - Tayyib Ali]
Yeah, oh it’s the realest shit
Dear Lord, I want it, so you gotta tell me something
Growing up I was crazy, same streets I lost my mother
And since we talk in public, I can’t tell you about my brother
But I guess he thought them niggas couldn’t touch him
Yo, can I live without struggle
When we was fourteen, we stopped going to school
Rapping on days off, trapping on days off
One day I’ll make it to New York in time
But until then, I’m on my grind, niggas dying and shit
Still got my old chucks on the wire and shit
Sometimes I cry for a bit, but then my homie told me it was life
Same night I got goals so I’m trying play the game right
I’m a star and I know it, soul in the dirt
But when I’m hurt, man I still don’t show it
Even though what mattered to me it will never change actually
It will only make me a man
Yo it’s easy to do the same thing with both your people’s in jail
And that’s the reason you ain’t have to be in at 12
And all the things I’m doing now, I’m doing it well
Cause if I stay here, I’ll be dead or in jail for real!

[Hook]
Hustle all the time, just trying to get it right (all night)
I pray to God that we’ll make it through the night (all right)
I gotta make the best out of life
Get it for cheap, or pay the price (right)
Yeah, hustle all the time, just trying to get it right (all night)
I pray to God that we’ll make it through the night (all right)
I gotta make the best out of life
Get it for cheap, or pay the price (right)

[Verse 2 - Tayyib Ali]
Yo, if I keep my faith in God, I can shine when the time come
The grind got me nation wide like Verizon
I know some niggas put their future right behind them
Crystal right besides them, never worry about the outcome
Now the jail cell is where some of them reside in
I can’t do that shit
No pussy, no weed, no studio
I’m hella serious, I know I sound goofy, though
But this the story of my life, I grew up where some don’t make it
And the skinny niggas pack guns, stick it in their arms
Nightmares on the floor, woke up early in the morn
I'm feelin like it’s fourth and long
On the field, the disadvantages, told my niggas, they don’t understand this shit
I inspire people, I'm try win a Grammy with
Crooked letter, swear I'm on some David Banner shit
I just hope I see the day that I understand this shit!

[Hook]
Hustle all the time, just trying to get it right (all night)
I pray to God that we’ll make it through the night (all right)
I gotta make the best out of life
Get it for cheap, or pay the price (right)
Yeah, hustle all the time, just trying to get it right (all night)
I pray to God that we’ll make it through the night (all right)
I gotta make the best out of life
Get it for cheap, or pay the price (right)
