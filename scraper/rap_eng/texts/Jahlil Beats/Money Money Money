Money money money, money money money (x8)

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Yeah, everyday I hustle, everyday I'm gettin' money
If her pussy good then everyday I'm spendin' money
Throw it in the bag, throw it in the bag
I ain't got credit but your dog got cash
Money money money, stay out of my lane
Your team runnin' laps, my team run the game
This is America, ain't shit free
I need my money tall, at least six-three

[Bridge: Red Cafe]
Blocka blocka blocka, money money money
Any given day, I'm pourin' honey on your honey
And I murder everybody, okay, everybody say it
(Money money money) if you broke, I'm sorry

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Yeah, yeah
It's Bad Boy bitch! Take that (Let's go!)
Wake up in the morning, take a money shower
Now I'm smellin' like money, got the money and the power (Yeah)
Ba-Bad Boy money (Uh-huh) Martin and Will (That's right)
My face good money, they should put me on the bill (C'mon)
I pioneered the jets and the yachts and the choppers (You know it)
Crushin' model chicks, throwin' minks on the toddlers (You know it)
NASDAQ money, Dow Jones Combs (C'mon man)
Money money money, motherfucker daddy's home (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
Cash Money, Young Money, Bad Boy money
Shorty said I boss, never throw toy money
So, blah, blah, motherfucker, I'm ill
Make that thing bounce with these hundred dollar bills
Now I'm gettin' money, I ball
I remember I ain't had no money at all
Now I'm so shallow, name-brand apparel
I'm that new-new err'day, wan' battle? Huh?!

[Bridge]

[Verse 4: Fabolous]
Clap for that money like the booty on shawty then
Y'all just keep clappin', studio, audience
Told her stretch it out like she doin' an accordion
And bust it, bust it, bust it like she snuck a Glock-40 in
Daddy gon' show you bitches how being spoiled feel
I got millions to waste, young oil field
Married to the money (money) faithful to the millions (millions)
Got my money up (up) safe is in the ceiling
