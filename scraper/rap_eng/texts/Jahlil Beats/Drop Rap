[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Fresh up off the stove, I'm hotter than a bitch
Black diamond Audemar is holding down my wrist
I'm the shit you playing, nigga you know my name dawg
And shawty let me cut call me
Fresh up off the stove, I'm hotter than a bitch
Black diamond Audemar is holding down my wrist
I'm the shit you playing, nigga you know my name dawg
And shawty let me cut call me Mr Chainsaw
This beat goes so hard, and so does your broad
And when she see me, if it's easy ha, it's your fault
Lamborghini, Fettuccine counts as dough dawg
Big ice on my neck look like snowballs
Anyway that I get it I don't care, I do it when I do I does it
And you know me, shitting on niggas and I do it in public
I know you're mad why? And I ain't trying to brag
I'm just talking about the shit that you wish you had
My tattoos compliment my attitude
Light skin nigga but I'm not an average dude
You're an opener and I'm going after you
Headline, I hope you niggas read the news

[Chorus: Petey Pablo]
When they see me their jaw drop, yeah
Better cuff your chick when she see me her drawer drops, yeah
Shutting the club down, nigga that's on top
They telling me slow down, but I ain't never gon' stop, ha okay
Where the Rosé, Ciroc?
Mixed wit OJ, I'm hot
You not, but it's okay
Yao Ming shit to me, no way haha

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Gucci shades, my chain looks like Minute Maid
Blowing up is what I do, I'm a big grenade
Star stunting, these nigga fronting show me something
A whole clique niggas shitting, bullets dumping
And when you see me, please believe me that I'm fly as hell
I got a rack of broads, I call it my clientèle
Tyga at the wing, two girls that's a three piece
Now you see why all these singers tryna to be me
Now what you talking about to the haters throw them deuces up?
Back number one, middle finger's is up
Straight to the top zoom zoom that's how I go
And then I drop the top on my Mercielago
It's not a game nigga, so I ain't got to play
My niggas Mac and Diesel, it's Yung by the way
G5 so I ain't got to wait
The most hated on, so I ain't gotta hate

[Chorus: Petey Pablo]
When they see me their jaw drop, yeah
Better cuff your chick when she see me her drawer drops, yeah
Shutting the club down, nigga that's on top
They telling me slow down, but I ain't never gon' stop, ha okay
Where the Rosé, Ciroc?
Mixed wit OJ, I'm hot
You not, but it's okay
Yao Ming shit to me, no way haha

And we don't care how many bottles or how much that they cost
We like them dope boys, we just left off the block
We open both doors and then we keep 'em locked

He's a motherfucking chump and I'm a real thug

[Chorus: Petey Pablo]
