*Jahlil Beats, Holla at me!''
[Verse 1: Neef Buck]
On the brown, orange hairs in my reefa
My watch and my Glock is a 40 milometer
Day to day, olive green face compliment the crease
Soon as I step in the place
Ok, ok, you niggas getting some money
But, you can't buy swag, we still look at you funny
Uh, popping bottles, oh, you niggas hype
This shit is lite, we can do this every night
This ain't accounted for, all I spend is extras
I'm in the game, moving blocks like Tetris
First, I beat the pot, weigh it up and beat the block
You know it's straight drop when they start to milly-rock
Big dimes, got it like the cheese line
On the slow grind, trying to duck the fed time
Backwoods rolling, hookah smoke flowing
Taking pictures in my section like "who the hell knows him?"

[Hook: Jesse Rack$on] (2x)
Tabs, what the fuck is that?
Every time I'm out, I be fucking up cash
Nigga, I don't brag, these is just factz
Selections in my section and you at the bar sad

[Verse 2: Neef Buck]
Chasing my chickens, trying to even the score
But, your baby mom is forever, I can get a new whore (ha)
Let me chill, niggas still pay your bills, fuck around a kill a bitch
Ending up with a will
A good collar, run me bout a dollar
Still will put some gun powder in your rottweiler
Little bitch got potential, might need a sponsor
And, she ride the dick like a monster
Body almost perfect, in the (?) working
I just want a broad to play it low key
Fuck about the next, she only "joe" me
No harm, no foul, they pretend to be wild
Can't hear the whispers cause my jewelry too loud
Crash dummy, they won't miss you when you're gone
Talking bout a real nigga with some fake shit on
Guess speaking on other men must never get boring

[Hook: Jesse Rack$on] (2x)
Tabs, what the fuck is that?
Every time I'm out, I be fucking up cash
Nigga, I don't brag, these is just factz
Selections in my section and you at the bar sad
