(Verse 1 – Chase N Cashe)

Sitting in the studio apartment, room full of clothes
Music equipment and garbage from the fast food I just ran through
Spent my last on that shit ‘cause a nigga been starving
Still getting high, keep a bape shirt on
Once I get this phone call Irma get this work gone
Irma get this work off, get my rent paid
My land lord stay tripping ‘cause the rent late
I swear to God, man, I can’t stand that bitch face
She kicked me out, now I’m staying at my bitch place
She hold it down for a nigga in a big way
But she bad as fuck and got big cake
My pockets hurting and she know I need fresh gear
She give me half of the money when the check clear
I don’t know why she tripping, talking about ain’t shit
Had to break it with the bitch in a quick year
Now I’m sleeping on a couch in my little nigga house
Asking God “How the hell I even get here?”
I need some quick, quick cash and a quick, leak gash
Anything, just to get rich fast

(Pre-Hook – Chase N Cashe)
Until them people made me slow down
Handcuffed in the back of patrol now
Jail cell is where they trying to make my home now
Praying that I get this bail money from a phone dial
I’m just hoping that they picked up
Collect all when I hear a
One ring, two rings, three rings, four rings
Nigga, pick up!

(Chorus Kobe)
I’m in a line of fire, and niggas taking shots at me
Niggas taking shots, but I’m sending them right back
Niggas ain’t stopping me
No, I can’t stop, if it’s like this right now
Imagine how the top gon’ be
Imagine how the top gon’ be
All I know is niggas ain’t stopping me
No one ain’t stopping me

(Verse 2 – Chase N Cashe)
Hard times , I’m familiar with ‘em
I’m going through some things now, but I’m dealing with ‘em
I had to drop a couple friends, wasn’t feeling niggas
You know I only play the cards, god deal me, nigga!
Be on the road with my dogs try to make it crack
I do a 20 minute show just to make some stacks
Remember when I couldn’t find a booth ‘cause I couldn’t find a loop
Was dress to impress, but couldn’t even buy some food
Ramen noodles from the 99 cents store
Making beats, ‘cause the dream was to get more
Double time on my tempo
I had to speed up, re up, ‘cause they didn’t wanna see me up
I had to get up, get out, now I’m kicking my feet up
Underrating my style but tell ‘em all sleep up!
Irma shake up the world and wake ‘em when I creep up
Let me shout out the SC, you know that we up
See the pain and the scars it all happen like so
For my age I’m a Don, better act like you don’t know
Sail away from the snitches, niggas acting like hoes
And away from the cops, they always on the watch

(Pre-Hook – Chase N Cashe)
Until them people made me slow down
Handcuffed in the back of patrol now
Jail cell is where they trying to make my home now
Praying that I get this bail money from a phone dial
I’m just hoping that they picked up
Collect all when I hear a
One ring, two rings, three rings, four rings
Nigga, pick up!

(Chorus Kobe)
I’m in a line of fire, and niggas taking shots at me
Niggas taking shots, but I’m sending them right back
Niggas ain’t stopping me
No, I can’t stop, if it’s like this right now
Imagine how the top gon’ be
Imagine how the top gon’ be
All I know is niggas ain’t stopping me
No one ain’t stopping me
