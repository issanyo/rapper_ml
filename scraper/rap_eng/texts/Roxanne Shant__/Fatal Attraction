Just gather 'round, this tale is rather chillin'
What I mean is thrillin', so listen if you're willin'
Cause Shanté has been through more than the average girl
Now I will send your mind through a twirl
Now usually I'm narrow-minded, never blinded
By any man, but some how I got binded
I mean caught up, he wasn't all that fly
I can't lie, he was cute in his suit and tie
But he wasn't my type, I mean he didn't own
A dope Benz with a rag top and a phone
He wasn't out gettin' paid by the mile
He was a different kind of man with a different style
He didn't sport a fat rope, and that was strange
He had a job at the New York Stock Exchange
Down on Wall Street, workin' 9 to 5
He was a man with a mind and a will to strive
He had a wife, but acted like she wasn't there
Long hair, they really made a lovely pair
But Shanté was ready for some real action
And this is the beginning of a fatal attraction

So I saw him nearly every day, what could I say?
"Hi, I'm Shanté, and could you leave the wife, by the way?"
I wasn't with it. He had to take the first step
I have a rep, and good is how I want it kept
But then it happened, one day he started kickin' it
And just to think, I thought that he was chicken shit
He gave his name, he couldn't give his number though
I gave him mine, and beat it like a drummer so
He wouldn't think I was on it but I really was
The same night, he had the nerve to give a buzz
And I thought, "Damn, what a bad brother"
He said his wife was out of town with her grandmother
Pay him a visit—I said "Yo, I'm not a dummy"
I know that's not the only kind of pay he wants from me
But I went, and somethin' told me not to go
But when I got there, he seduced me slow
Now I'm not the first date type
But this night Shanté was quite hype
And quite ready for all kinds of action
Soon you'll see why this is a fatal attraction

And so it happened, boy did it ever
I never been touched like that, I mean never
The whole weekend was very romantic
Then came Sunday, and I got frantic
Cause it was time to run, and I was havin' fun
He touched my cheek, and then he said "See ya, hon"
I went home and thought it was short
Time I realized that I was caught
And for the next four months of us dating
I kept anticipating and waiting
Because he told me he and his wife were through
Finished, over, I just had to wait a few
So I waited, and time kept passin' on
Three more months, and still she wasn't gone
I got mad, I asked him what the problem was
We sat down, and bust what the brother does
"Sorry, baby, what was I thinkin' of?
I have a wife, and that's who I really love
And as for us—" "Please, don't even run it
Cause if you loved her, you wouldn't've never done it"
I started breakin' and he was about to see some action
And feel the pain of a fatal attraction

Well, this story has such a sad ending
And I hope these men stop pretending
As if they're single, and try to mingle
Cause one day you might feel a tingle
Between your legs, and when you look down to check
Ha, surprise! Go 'head and break your neck
Search high and low, look near and far
But what you're lookin' for is somewhere in a pickle jar
Just like him, cause he's in a hospital
He had a big one, but now it's kind of little
So little, he can't stick it any place
He tried to play me, and he lost the race
But that's not that he lost
Jimmy's gone, and that's the cost
Of my fatal attraction
