[Verse 1]
Save all the drama
Cause here comes the Big Mama
Any bitch who rip Shanté, I bomb her
Cause y'all weak-ass hoes got me fed up
So hookers, get your gloves, and yo, let's go head up
Wall to wall y'all, all will fall
I don't stall cause in this brawl, it's winner takes all
A title bout for all the clout
Any hooker trying to step to this, it's lights out
One hit, your head split, throat slit
Think you're Miss It, but I started this shit
At 14 years old I was going gold
While I was on tour, you was touring the ho stroll
Sucking dicks and turning tricks to get a quick fix
While I was putting dope hits in the mix
Ripping shows with Kane and Biz Markie
Fucking up Roxanne and taking out Sparky
Niggas came in flocks from blocks and blocks
To watch the Rox knock bitches out the box
And every place I played, I headlined
Strictly big names on the topic read mine
The q-u-double e-n
Queen of emceeing
Whenever I flow it's poetry in
Motion, so you can save all the drama
And get the fuck out the way, here comes the Big Mama

[Hook]
(Mama - mama - Aww!)
(I gave birth to most of them MC's)

[Verse 2]
Rhymes are deadly, so hooker, write out your will
Here comes the queen foot-first to your grill
Reciting poems that hit like boulders
Smacking your head dead off your motherfucking shoulders
So nip all the talk in the bud
This ain't no game, boy, I came to draw blood
At any hag thinking that she could last with me
It only takes one blast, and that ass'll be
Wrecked, ruined, damaged, ripped
Cross my path, your ass'll get whipped
Cause Shanté ain't about no games
Matter of fact, yo, I'mma start calling off names
First up is Latifah
You roll up, and I'mma smoke that ass like reefer
Cause you ain't never in life been a star to me
Sold the fuck out trying to go R&B
Now that shit is shady
You say ladies first, well I'm the first lady
And all y'all hoes are phony
Try to get flipped, I'mma rip you and your girl Monie
You're illegitimate, tryin to get a little bit
And I'm about sick of that 'Monie-in-the-middle'-shit
Your album cold garbage
Had one good jam, now you think you a star, bitch
Breaking your neck trying to be in the limelight
But give you a mic, and you can't even rhyme right
So get the fuck off the scene
Cause I got a M-16 that says 'Shanté's the queen'
And all you bitches got your style from me
The capital S-h-a-n-t-é
Used to go to my show, analyze how the sound flow
On the down low, fuck around, lay around, ho
So save all the drama
And make room for the Big Mama

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The real queen's in effect
Whenever I come, yo, I come correct
And niggas give me the utmost due respect
And any hag that try to last
'll cold get smoked like marijuana cause her ass is grass
I dig ditches for you bitches
While I collect riches and give you a head full of stitches
Cause in a beef I don't sleep or lollygag
Sending you hags offstage in a bodybag
Cause Shanté is a rebel
You say you're "Lyte as a Rock," you get crushed like a pebble
One word, and I'mma bag her
Watch the bitch stagger, cause I don't dig the bulldagger
To me a butch don't deserve a mic in hand
Somebody tell her to stop acting like a man
She needs something real thick to help her out quick
(What?) And that's a good piece of dick
Now as for that West Coast slut
With fake-ass hair, contacts, and a padded butt
Instead of "stompin to tha 90s", use your brain
And stomp your ass down to Jack LaLane
You better hurry and hop on a diet plan
And keep the pork chops out the frying pan
Yeah, I said it, so what?
You roll up, slut, you get a fucking gun buck to your gut
I'm bringing tears to all my peers
I ain't new, I been doin this shit for ten years
Bring any ho, and I'll wreck her
I rip the nicest, from Isis down to Salt-N-Pepa
And now you know that I'm the star of the show, ho
While I get dough, you're giving up the yo-yo
You say a nigga can't play with it
You got another job? Well bitch, you better stay with it
Cause you ain't shit in this here
Shanté's the queen, and I'm making it clear
Kicking flavors the way it's supposed to be
That's why no other emcees coming close to me
I leave em all in the dust
From crumbs to crust
It's a must that all opponents get bust
So get the fuck off the stage and save all the drama
And make room for the Big Mama

[Hook]
