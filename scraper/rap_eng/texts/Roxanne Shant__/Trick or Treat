[Verse 1]
So you say you got money but ain't spendin' it?
Well if that's your move, fool, Shanté has been in it
You gotta peep what's on display, honey
And I ain't sleepin' around for sneaker money
Picture me lettin' a nigga get his dick soaked
Then splittin' and hittin' a mother fucker cold broke
I gotta look out for self, dear
Give me the riches you can keep those other bitches on welfare
Where's my props and all that?
Yeah you're goddamn right that I'm a spoiled-ass brat
"But Shanté, I love you, baby."
But what the fuck have you done for me lately?
I'm not sayin' I got a fee
I'm just sayin' that the pussy ain't for free
I ain't tryin' to play you like a sucker
But if you get in these pants, believe you paid for the motherfucker
It ain't about a nigga peepin' me
It's all about a nigga treatin' me and eatin' me
Playin' niggas in the streets
You either lick or you trick or you treat

[Verse 2]
A nigga can't play me like I'm soft
Steady flashin' all that cash, nigga pass off
'Cause there's no layin up if niggas ain't payin' up
I'm out for the bucks, I ain't playin' ducks
I'm shallow in the gifts than men give
I need a place, 'cause my taste is expensive
So if you crack a lot on the drug lot
I want diamonds big as motherfuckin' Plymouth Rock
I'm [?] that slack
And when their pockets ain't fat, I make em scat like a cat
Shanté likes a candlelight dinner
But that just ain't enough to get up in her
Make me glitter if you want to hit a home run
No money, you're gettin' left on a bone, son
And I'll be [?] 'cause ain't nobody stiffin' me
Ain't no ho-hoppin' without shoppin' at Tiffany's
It's not about havin' a man up in my fanny
And goin' home broke and wet all in the panties
There ain't a motherfucker THAT cute
To knock Shanté's boots without spendin' loot
So if you make a lot of bank
Remember you don't get the pretty pink without a mink
So if you see me in the streets
Holdin' hands with a man then he's a trick or a treat

[Verse 3]
Send me a limo, fuck the cabs
I'm only up for grabs if you got tabs
So I'm tellin' all you cheapskates
You can't get the case just for takin' me to beefsteaks
You think [it ain't down to your knees?]
But you gets one of these without G's
So before my legs can crack, hit me off with a stack
Or step your black nigga ass back
'Cause I got money I have to make
And if you can't play the rate, then your ass'll have to masturbate
It's all about the gimme-gimme
You say you want to get with the slimmy but yo your jimmy ain't goin' in me
You gotta get 'em for the bucks
'Cause you only get stressed messin' around with broke fucks
You want ass, the cash is first
You got dead presidents baby, I got a hearse in my purse
So call off Washingtons and Lincolns
I want the Grants and the Benjamin Franklins
So I hope your pocket's steep
You [?] dick, use a trick or a treat
