[Verse 1]
Some people call me Shanie, some people call me Rox
And those who try to diss I just knocks them out the box
Cos I'm Shanté and y'all know the routine
And here we go again, so all hail the queen
I left you for a while but it was worth the wait
Because it gave me just enough time to create
A funky rhythm that's guaranteed to move the world
Have the party people screaming out, "Go on Girl!"
Just like Diana Ross, I'm the boss
And those who disapprove you can go for yours
But to think a girl like me, ha, is easy to take
You should treat me like Nell Carter, give me a break
Cause I'm the super female that's called Shanté
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

[Verse 2]
A lotta MCs today really know how to please
But I gave birth to most of them MCs
So when it comes around to the month of May
Send me your royalty check for Mother's Day
Because yo, ya know, ya can't deal with this
I'm Shanté the microphone grandmistress
A pioneer like Lola Folana
With a name that stands big like Madonna
Speaking of Madonna, some girls on the mic
Rap like virgins and get real tight
But I get loose with the rhymes I produce
That's why I'm queen of the crew with the juice
Cos I'm the super female that's called Shanté
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

[Verse 3]
Shanté, the baddest around
And a name like that can be broken down
As Supreme Highness Almighty Noble Topics Exponent
And any title for a girl, you can believe I own it
Cause to me there ain't nothing fresher
For me to rock..my pleasure
I'll pick up the microphone and start rocking
Say the funky rhymes that have the people clocking
Me, the S-H-A-N-T-E
Good looking, never tooken female MC
I'm five foot four, maybe a little bigger
Brown skin complexion with a nice figure
Yes, the super female that's called Shanté
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

[Verse 4]
You may remember the voice from a few years ago
When I first came out and dissed UTFO
I chilled for a while, I put down my pen
But now some suckas from the Bronx got me started again
Now I'm not out to diss the whole Boogie Down
Just a featherweight crew from that part of town
You made a little record and then you start fronting
Tried to diss the Juice Crew but ain't hurt nothing
Now KRS-ONE, you should go on vacation
With that name sounding like a wack radio station
And as for Scott La Rock, you should be ashamed
When T La Rock said "It's Yours", he didn't mean his name
So step back, peasants, popping all that junk
Or else BDP will stand for Broken Down Punks
Cause I'm an all-star just like Julius Erving
And Roxanne Shanté is only good for steady serving
