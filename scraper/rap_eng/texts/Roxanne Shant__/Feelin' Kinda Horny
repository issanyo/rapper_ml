[Intro]
(This is definitely happening)
Ladies and gentlemen
Cold Chillin' Records proudly presents
Roxanne Shante featuring Q Neighbor, formerly Chilly Q
With Rich Joseph, Todd Sherman and my man Corey on that assistant, y'know what I'm sayin'
Special thank you goes out to Bobby from Tower Records
Yo, I'm feelin' kinda horny right about now
So, Shaunie, kick some flavour for me

[Verse 1]
Well it's about time the R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Grabbed the mic and stole your man and have you pissed at me
Just like old times, remember how they used to be
I was the only female on the mic that you want to see
But times have changed and I'm taking you a ride
Lookin' past the buildings and just after you reach the sky
I want a man who's a one woman kinda guy
My son Kareem is a lot but he doesn't feel the side of me
That needs to be released, you see
I want a man to relieve the beast in me
Come if you will but just come correct
And if you're really sure of yourself, then place your bets
I got Q ball standin' 'bout oh so tall
Nice cameo, cut
Here's your beeper, make a call
Jae Love is on the side, and never looking corny
Fellas blow the trumpets 'cause I'm feelin' kinda horny

[Hook]
Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny

[Verse 2]
When I say horny I mean the horns that I'm playin'
Go real well with the words that I'm sayin'
Produced by Jae Love and the neighbor Chilly Q
I'm hooked upon the sounds that they gave to me to bring to you
It leaves you wonderin', just how is it?
Rhymes so dope, so short it's like a visit
There many MCs, or should I say wannabes
Touch the microphone without grace and ease
It's the way you move, you gotta show n prove
You know what you doin' or you're bound to get boo'd
But not Shanté, I'm sure to do it the right way
Collect the money, rock the party, start up on a new day
It's just a talent, that's got to be god given
Sucka MCs, tell me how you livin'
It's a damn shame that your rhymes are so corny
Fellas blow the trumpets 'cause I'm feelin' kinda horny

[Hook]
Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny

[Verse 3]
Going back to what I said, first paragraph
Me needing a man? Now that's a laugh
Shanté is solo, ete numero uno
Speaking from the top, et cetera et cetera, eh you know
You get the picture, I'll smack ya little bitch-ya
You tryna stay on base but like a batter I'll hit ya
Gotta run? 'or you might get tagged, sid
Matter of fact, tag me 'cause I'm it
Miss thing, yeah, stamp it on a diamond ring
You get your free food 'cause your girl's Burger King's daughter
But you both are sort of corny
Fellas blow the trumpets, 'cause I'm feelin' kinda horny

[Hook]
Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny

[Verse 4]
I'm in love with a trumpet, is that possible?
Chilly Q I must be buggin', call a hospital
Horny: a word used by the wind section
If I was a man it would be cause for an erection
Standing up tall, slouching not accepted
Jae gave me the beat as a gift and I kept it
Got so much to say but so little time to say it in
Give me a dope beat and like a gangsta I'll do it in
Gotta go, gotta go
But I'll be back again, see you at my next show
Or maybe at the movies, eating pop-corny
Peace and love to ya 'cause I'm feelin' kinda horny

[Hook]
Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny
