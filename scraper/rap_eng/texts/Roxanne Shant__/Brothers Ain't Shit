Brothers ain't shit
They lookin' for the next big ass they can stick
But this here chick's not on your dick
Pulling your cars up close by the sidewalk
And got the nerve to get mad if I don't talk
Stay schemin' on how they wanna stick it from the back
A young muthafucka sellin' crack
Go home and go to bed son
Your just coming from the barber shop and tryna' get your head done
Take your ass downtown on 10th Avenue
Because a sister like me is not having you
Playa, going round tellin' other brothers that you laid her
So I guess I'll see your ass later
Some brothers approach you while your shopping
Their girl's not around so they're going ho-hoppin'
From one girl to another
You turn your head for a minute, he's tryna kick it to your mother
Stop smilin'
I know all you wanna do is hit
And I really don't give a shit
They get mad cause I always look serious
So they swear I'm on my muthafuckin' period
I'm not impressed by the jewelry and the mink, dummy
Why don't you put some of your money in the bank, sonny
And if I hurt your feelings, I meant to
Cause these here pants, huh, you can't get into
Matter of fact I'm tooken
So you brothers in the Jeep can keep lookin' but I ain't hookin'
Yes I'm giving you the slip
All you can do is trick
Word
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit

I'm on my way to the mall with a couple of friends
Some niggas pull up in a blue Benz
A kid named Mark with dark glasses
Talkin' about "Yo, y'all got some real fat asses"
I kept walkin'
Tracy stopped and started talkin'
With all these motherfuckers hawkin'
With that dumb looking grin
Bitch gets in the car that was carrying three men
I know the whole game well
They spend a little money, you end up at a hotel
Well that's how they planned it
She didn't wanna screw so they left her ass stranded
That's what she get for whilin'
Cold left the dumb bitch somewhere out in Long Island
Next time she'll act decent
And her moms won't have to come and get her ass from a precinct
Remember Shant√© told you
Drugs is not the only thing a girl can say no to
You gotta watch every move that you make on the street
Word up, cause talk ain't that cheap
It may become a bad habit
You see a brother with a little bit of dough, you wanna grab it
I get approached by a man sometimes, I throw a fit
Word
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
So don't honk your horn keep rolling
No I don't wanna ride cause the shit might be stolen
Anyway, I know your number
You got a "gas, grass, or ass" sticker on your bumper
Go ahead and say I'm stuck up
Cause I ain't doin nothing that'll make my rep. fucked up
Cause it happens to the best of us
Fuck the rest of us, niggas keep testing us
A man can make you wanna kill him
Or late at night, make you wanna thrill him
He'll give you money, you can even be fly
But he still has to cheat and you wanna know why
That's the dog in him, 'woof, woof!'
That makes him get up in the middle of the night and go 'POOF!'
You say 'Yo, yo where you going?'
He's cheating and he's skeezing and you're not even knowing
But this is what they usually do
Suck on the ting and they make you go 'WOO!'
And then he hits the door
And for the rest of the night you don't see him no more
He's got shit at your house, here's what you do
You should do some voodoo, hmm
Make his dick small
Make him see spiders on the wall
Then make him throw a fit
Why?
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
