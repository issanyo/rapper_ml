(Intro)
RS: Excuse me, but who would you be?
SD: Yeah that's right, I'm Sparky D
So listen my girl, what you have to say?
RS: Get it right, baby, Roxanne Shanté

[Verse 1: Sparky D]
Hi Roxanne, and how do you do?
My name is Sparky D, and I'm pleased to meet you
Let me tell you something, girl, that you should know
I'm Sparky D, and I'm running this show
You got braces in your mouth, you're full of disgust
Don't bother drinking water, 'cause your mouth will rust
You went to the doctor, and what did you hear?
The doctor said "Rox, you got gonorrhea"
So you went back home and said "Help me please"
Your man looked at you and said "You gave me fleas"
You went back home, and started to nag
You started looking at your [?]
He said "Damn, where you get this from?
Sparky D was right, I am a crab [?]"
So listen Roxanne, here's something to learn
You had a right guard but it made a left turn

[Verse 2: Roxanne Shanté]
A right guard? A wrong turn?
This is something that you must learn
'Cause you took it too far, and that is right
Now it's my turn, yes, to get on the mic
To prove to you that I'm the best
When I say my rhymes, I prove they are fresh
To let you know how far you'd go
Before I let everyone know you're a ho
I got you off the stroll in case you didn't know
And if you do not like it, I ask "You wanna throw?"
Cause see, I don't play games
And don't call me no names
The words that you say do not make me shamed
Now I don't play with girls like you
Frankly when you say that I am through
But listen here, you know you're whack
Took a half-assed bite and you're much too fat

[Verse 3: Sparky D]
Oh such a pity, you're really too skinny
You're only fifteen, and you're just growing titties
You think you're a star with a size A bra?
And if you don't believe me I'll show DJ Marley Marl
You call me fat but I'm also fly
Say it once again and I'll punch you in the eye
I drag you, ho, up and down the streets
Then you know Sparky D can never be beat
I was walking one night, all alone
And I happened to glance by the funeral home
I rubbed my eyes, what did I see?
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E

[Verse 4: Roxanne Shanté]
I told everybody you was all on mines
See, there you go, sayin' my lines
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Stay off my shit, Miss Sparky D
I tried to tell you, don't mean to yell it
Do I have to break down and spell it?
Will you learn? It's my concern
Cause it is you I play to burn
You think I'm playin'? Listen to what I'm sayin'
You think that I'm jokin'? I don't need a token
Just listen to the words that I have spoken
Yes you live in Brownsville, and you are ill
Me and you could never be chill
'Cause you can't hang, that's right, I'm Miss Thang
I'll knock you out, with a boom and a bang
Now yes, you're a heavyweight, and that might be great
But you're the only one who'll be leaning over the gate
Getting fucked in the ass listen to [?]
And you're the only girl who ain't got class
'Cause they told me, you didn't think I'd hear
But they told it straight to me real clear
They tell me all about you
And all the niggas in Brooklyn that you screw

[Verse 5: Sparky D]
I'm Sparky D, and you should know
I've got pretty long hair and yours can't grow
I met this girl, and you know that's true
I'll explain this doll all to you
Her name was Shanté and she is wack
You couldn't hardly see her, she was too damn black
'Cause she got real mad 'cause I am too fly
If I was that crab I'd rather just die
Her name is Shanté and she is a dog
She's always on the border and she leaps like a frog
Every time that I see her, she's too young
She's too young to even make a man come
Every time that I see her, I'm the best
I'm Sparky D, and the case is dismissed
So listen my girl, this is something to dig
You cut your hair so you wouldn't wear a wig
Listen my girl, you're too skinny
If I was you, you're worth a penny
A penny

[Verse 6: Roxanne Shanté]
A penny? A nickel? [?] yourself then, [?]
Everyone told me how you did it
And if you did something like that, God forbid it
'Cause we all know that you're not with it
And when you [?] they spy your [?]
But he couldn't hit it, and you couldn't get it
So it's time for you, to get down with it
Now you must be blind, deaf and dumb
When I walk down the block I make Spyder come
Everyone knows just how I am
When I get on the mic, I don't give a damn
If you see that I rock, don't you see it is me
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Now you made me mad, you got me started
Now I bug out, cold get retarded
The rhymes I say: devastating
And yes you know you'll be imitating
And everyone knows that you're perpetrating
Now if you've never encountered an MC like me
I'll bust this shit here Sparky D
When it comes to rhymes I say
You can't hang with me, Miss Shanté
When I say Miss, I don't mean bitch
And this is something for a switch
I'm a girl, and I'm a [?]
You's nothing but a low-life scamp
I call you a scamp instead of a tramp
You walk down the block with your panties all damp
Everyone knows that that is right
And the doctor met you the other night
I went to his office, and there you had [?]
But you told him that he's reading my chart
When he read to you, don't you know what it said?
"Damn, I want to get that girl to bed"
When he read your chart straight to you
He said "I'm sorry, Sparky D, but your pussy is through"
He didn't know what to give you yet
To fix your shit to make it fresh
Because yes your cookie is all crumbs
You's the only crab lowlife bitch who's a bum
You live in Brooklyn, you ain't good lookin'
Yeah I heard about your cookin'
I don't play games, don't call me no names
I'll say some shit to make you feel shame
I already talked about you with [?]
I talk about you, and that you suck dick
I told everybody how I rock a party
And when they see you that you're totally nobody
