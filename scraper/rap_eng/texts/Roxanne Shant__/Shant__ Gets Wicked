("Let me tell you somethin'")
("Shanté's performin' and it's gonna be wicked")

[Verse 1]
Shanté gets wicked as I kick it
Booty MCs better ease 'fore I stick it
So far the [?] can't even find it
Music is my business, and so you better mind it
Cause if I see your nose, end it I'm a bend it
Send it to the hospital to be mended
There's too many stank skanks wanna be top rank
[?] MCs are gonna be shanked
Sucker MCs I despise, who try to rise
Up with the same old style as [?]
Boom is the sound of the bass and I kick it
In your face, in the place, MCs get a taste
But before you eat it up, let me heat it up
And wash your face, just in case I wanna beat it up
You can't sit, you wanna get with the shit
That makes you have a fit 'bout every time you hear it
I drop rhymes hard as [?] on your head
Sleepin' MCs are already in the bed
This is a wake-up call as I break up all
Bullshit MCs in the rap world
You can't test the [?] this
And I don't miss, I just bust you with a fist
Blood, pus, and other stuff is gonna ooze out
Girl you're gonna lose out, break the [?] shoes out
And you still can't go up against me
I'll have you livin' on the [?]
WKRP, now what kind of [?] will pose a threat to me?
Not one, son, they all got done
Cause none of those sorry MCs are number one
Ah, here we go see kick it
Cause Shanté gets wicked

[Hook]
Shanté gets wicked as I kick it
("Get wicked!")
("Let me tell you somethin')
("Shanté's performin' and it's gonna be wicked")
("Go on, girl!") ("Get wicked!")

[Verse 2]
I get wicked 'til the jam is done
Somebody yelled out "The bitch got a gun"
But yo, look again, that's not what I'm holdin'
Just your attention and the mic. I rolled in
To the party, I didn't have to reach
They already had a mic so [?]
Just the [?], what a joke
I pulled myself together, then I broke
Fool, I took em to school in a duel
So I taught as I fought, and it's a [?]
Understand the ways that my mind works
And what's at stake cause I break when I find jerks
Holdin' a mic, but they're not hype enough
Cause that's the type of stuff that makes me ride 'em rough
And that's why they're in a cat's eye
And I'm unannounced when I pounce to to the rest. Try
To escape the hills they're heading for
Ride it for life and I might keep sheddin' more
Than you can take, so put on your darker shades
And here we go cause I'm gonna spark the page
And rip parties apart with a passion
I move your butt and that's what brings the cash in
I saw you run for the dance floor and when your pants tore
You just kept movin' like ants or
Beetles were in your drawers, watch the needle [?]
With the [?] is gonna cut into my jaws, pause
Stand clear as the mic is grabbed
The girl is here and MCs is stabbed
Not with a knife but a rhyme and [?]
And something you care for and therefore you shank
Egos are bleedin' three rows of rappers
Pleadin' that I hold back but I'm proceedin'
To give a bunch of rhymes and the punch of
A champ, as I [?] to the hunch of
Victory, it's no small trick to be
Rhymin' off strong, yo that sounds slick to me
So I'ma drop somethin' really really rough on ya
I know you want it, don't even try to bluff on it
Yeah, you didn't think that I could kick it
Cause Shanté gets wicked

[Hook]
