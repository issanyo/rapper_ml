[Intro: Rotary Connection & Fabolous]
So why donâ€™t you leave me alone?
For life is so exciting on the island in my room
And as I sing and dance along the shadows of the moon
You know it's funny
People on the outside don't really get what's going on
But they always got something to say, haha, yeah

[Hook: Fabolous & Pusha-T]
It's the life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting baby

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
South Beach, spent time there, off shores my time wear
Whole crew got they own watch, nigga we ain't buying no time shares
The lifestyle, too fly, my new bitches get next flighted
I'd say I'm back to the old me but my old bitches'll get excited
Ain't going back, I'm stepping forward, don't test me, been prepping for it
Got no time for that hating shit, my young niggas got weapons for it
Got Chief Keefs that ain't shy, that bang-bang, that blocka
And all you niggas is blockers, change your name to Ibaka
Shit real, shit been real and shit just get realer
I'm showing bitches my car keys then ask them what's the dealer
Ain't saying that's your girl, ain't saying shit like prank callers
Cause it's a small world and hoes make it even smaller

[Hook: Fabolous & Pusha-T]
It's the life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting baby (King Push)

[Verse 2: Pusha-T]
It's beach weather over here, nigga, sky's clear, nigga
That's flip flops, that's Americana, that's Hilfiger
Yachtmasters at the yacht party, sitting at the dock is a drop 'rari
That's pole position with a joystick, that's push button that's like Atari
Raising the bar, no parallel, so many horses, carousel
How we roll out like a caravan, ghost in the snow, see Carol Ann
Maryland, tags on it, heroin, bags on it
Hermes, throw pillows, Missoni couch and it clash on it
Take a look in my viewfinder and see seven figures and two commas
I see bad bitches, see blue diamonds, I see-saws, I two time em'
Gigolo, juggle hoes, jigsaw, I puzzle those
Cross words, cross birds, I cross country with a couple those

[Hook: Fabolous & Pusha-T]
It's the life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting baby

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
When the sun is out, we runs about
Let the world see what these hunnids about
Ain't seen this since the one was out
With Jay, Pimp C, and Bun
We out here, still pimping that big
Looking that jig, someone go call Hype Willi'
We need slow mo', more Rose Mo'
Niggas is drunk and type silly
We dancing like Dame, holding up chains
Got PMBs on a big ass boat on molly, rolling up Jane
This life is so exciting, that money be so inviting
So fuck what they're indicting, tell my lawyers keep on fighting

[Hook: Fabolous & Pusha-T]
For the life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting baby
Life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (woo!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting baby
