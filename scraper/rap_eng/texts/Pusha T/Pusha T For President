Yugh!
Coming live and direct from the kitchen
Here's yours neighbourhood pusher
El Presidente, Blow-Bama, DJ SpinKing
You know we doing this for the culture, right?
All my young niggas getting money
We only here for motivation and inspiration
So when you see us pulling up in that six figure shit
When you see us hopping out draped in that six figure shit
When you see us leaving, know we going back to some seven figure shit
Know that we doing this for you
Many mansions's the minimum
Shout out to all my niggas getting to it
Hating washed niggas die slow
This ain't for you, yugh!
