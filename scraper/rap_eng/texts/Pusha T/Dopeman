[Chorus]
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
Dopeman

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Once upon a time, there lived a little bad bitch
I just pressed the buttons on my little gadget
Born in December cuz I am a Sagit-tarius
Maybe just a little bi-curious
Yo, miney-mo-to-eenie-meenie
Your wish is my command, I mean, I really really mean it
Cause I am the lady that was on I Dream of Genie
They call it spaghetti but I call it linguini
Coke fizzles if you wanna get the sniffles
I got that wet-wet it could get wetter than a drizzle
Plus I got plenty, no seeds in my twenty
And I just got them peanut butter crack sandwiches
You need a dopeman, oh, you need a snowman
I got that Lohan, weight like Rosanne
But fucking with my money is a no-no, man
I got them Barbarians, they call me Conan

[Chorus]
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
Dopeman

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Powder on my palm to palm a horse [?]
Olympiair, push cocaine by the square
Truth or dare, Interstate riding with the pair
We tuck 'em in buckle pray the Lord get us there
Yeah, the price is so low
I'm [?] like special with the blow
The dopeman's dope man, everybody knows
It's the crimes and the rhymes that thelonious flow
Go don, I go dance, I go vixen
I slash through the snow like St. Nicholas
Go stacks, go ninas, go kicks
And blow drug dealer money on drug dealer bitches
Yugh, and we don't do snitches well
We saying that you hate nigga's kiss and tell
Wishing I was holed up in a cell
Throw yo' ass over to the bottom of that wishing well

[Chorus]
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
Dopeman
