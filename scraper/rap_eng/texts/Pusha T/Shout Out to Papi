[Hook: Lunch Money]
Let's go see Papi, let's go see Papi
He give me the yayo, I get the block jumping
Shout out to Papi, shout out to Papi
He give me the cocaine, I bring back the money
Let's go see Papi, Papi, Papi
Shout out to Papi, Papi, Papi
Let's go see Papi, let's go see Papi
He give me the yayo, I get the hood jumping

[Verse 1: Young Money Yawn]
Hola Diego, get half of your pesos
Give me more menthol, I need more of them Legos
Guapo the ocho, coke, 'bout a boatload
Son of El Chapo, which means I'm plugged in with Pablo
I am head honcho, so bring back [?]
Or I call up my shooters, I need all [?] pronto
Shout out Griselda, god damn would have nailed her
Front me a brick, swear I would not have failed her
Now back to the block I go, them project halls I sold
Get hit with the work, get rid of the work or [?]
Port of Miami, Scarface and Manny
We came here with nothin', they took us in like we're family

[Hook: Lunch Money]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Without bein' cocky, I'm callin' them copies
They wanna be Pusha, they doin' it sloppy
I'm movin' that snow, I'm skatin' like hockey
I run through these streets, a nigga feeling like Rocky
My wrists lookin' rocky, I'm flyin' a poppy
And drive from Arizona once I meet my compadres
I'm watchin' these niggas, they watchin' my money
They actin' the part, but they watches look funny
I hustle through winter, to live where it's sunny
The honeycomb hide out, I'm stashin' a bunny
I sold dope my whole rap career, for the record
And lived every line, so you gotta respect it

[Hook: Lunch Money]

[Verse 3: Young Money Yawn]
I'm tied to the coke cartel, they fresh on the boat, all yell
Got a spot off Thailand, another in the A, no tellin' where the boat gon' sell
Green Bay, real packers, they unload the wrappers
Count it all up, break it all down then dish it to trappers
Why they snatch Sosa? Doin' life for that yola
Pure Colombian coke, I'm still meetin' his quotas
Drugs are my savior, you bless me, I praise yah
Rather die on a cross, 'fore I snitch on my maker
These niggas talkin' work, they lyin', they put me in the dirt, they dyin'
If I go, everything falls, that's the life of organized crime
Police on payroll, don't play 'bout that yayo
Murder for hire, we'll peel back potatoes
