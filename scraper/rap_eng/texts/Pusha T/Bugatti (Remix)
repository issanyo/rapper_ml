[Intro: Pusha T]
Uh, it's a lifestyle, it's the lifestyle
Uh, let's go
Uh, can you turn the mic up?
Take it back, uh

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Million dollar dreamers, that comes with being genius
All that comes between us is that I'm all she Venus
I be with them dealers, that's twisting up they fingers
Selling all that white girl, and buyin' bitches Bimmers
Cocaine white arenas, tip the scale like Libras
Balmain on my denim, that still can't tuck my ninas (Yah!)
My ninas (Raah!), my ninas
Shout out to my hittas, surround myself with killas
Tiga, mi amigo, we both follow that G-code
Money over bitches, we drive her 'til she repos (Woo!)
That's lethal (Woo!), my chico (Woo!)
Bugatti (Ya!), from kilos

[Chorus: Tiga]
A girl comes up to me and says, "What you drivin'?"
I said, "Bugatti"
Girl comes up to me and says, "What you drivin'?"
I said, "Bugatti"
A girl comes up to me and says, "What you drivin'?"
I said, "Bugatti"
Girl comes up to me and says, "What you drivin'?"
I said, "Bugatti"
