[Intro: Janine Foster]
Baby, don't let me down
Got a lot goin' on right now
And I need you to hold me, need you to hold me

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Teamwork make the dream work
I want a best friend, you want a yes man
Lean on me like a kickstand
Problems come, you got a hitman
The rent man and the trip man
Bags on shoulder, Chanel on loafer
Yeah, sex on sofa
Goyard passport holders for both us
That's no fuss
I got it, you got it
My pocket's your pocket
I cop it, you rock it
No hater can stop it
King Push with the king flow
Janine, baby, that's mean yo
What's a love affair with a couple tears
When your number square's spellin' bingo?

[Verse 2: Janine Foster]
Baby, don't let me down
Got a lot goin' on right now
And I need you beside me, need you beside me

[Chorus: Janine Foster]
And when it gets cold
And I'm feelin' kinda lonely
I'm hopin' that you gonna put a cover on me
When it gets cold
And I'm feelin' kinda lonely
I'm hopin' that you gonna put a cover on me

[Verse 3: Janine Foster]
Baby, if I break down
Will you catch my tears before they hit the ground?
The ground
Baby, if I open my mouth
And let my darkest memories come out
I need you to stick around, need you to stick around

[Chorus: Janine Foster]
And when it gets cold
And I'm feelin' kinda lonely
I'm hopin' that you gonna put a cover on me
When it gets cold
And I'm feelin' kinda lonely
I'm hopin' that you gonna put a cover on me

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
I was searchin' for the fame and fortune
Tryna build a future
Tourin' season was your pain and torture
See how the game'll do ya?
Yuugh, I left you with the vultures
Your mother was poisoned, them bitches was spyin'
Money comin', engines runnin'
From in the clouds I couldn't hear the cryin'
See, that's my fault, and I can take that
The time lost, we couldn't make back
No Balmain, no Lanvin could replace that
See what you told me
I probably dismissed that shit with a roley
Well that's the old me
I want the old you, now come and hold me

[Bridge: Janine Foster]
Give me something good to feel
Touch me so I know it's real
Make it so I won't forget
Take me far from my regret
Give me something good to feel
Touch me so I know it's real
Never one to ask for help
But I'ma askin' this time

[Outro: Janine Foster]
Baby, don't let me down
Got a lot goin' on right now
And I need you to hold me
Oh, baby, don't let me down
I got a lot goin' on right now
And I need you beside me
