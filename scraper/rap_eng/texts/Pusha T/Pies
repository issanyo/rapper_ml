[Intro: Backyardigans]
Do you wanna make pies? Yes, I wanna make pies
Let me see it in your eyes, I wanna make pies
Then try this exercise
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies, pies?
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies?
Yes, I wanna make
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies, pies
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies?
Yes, I wanna make

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Pyrex bake pans, watch birds break-dance
I measured it perfect, the product’s in great hands (WOO)
You want the spoils, cook it to the oils
Versace bed and 12 thousand on my king coil.(God)
Couple diamonds keep ya bitch loyal
Roger Federer Rolex, my wrist royal.(Yeaughh)
Goyard trunks for luggage, nigga
Tell the bellman at the plaza not to tug it, nigga(Wooh)
Oh, it’s only luxury, when you ain't got it (Wooh)
It’s lifestyle when you can’t live without it.(Haaaaa)
Take a look at BabyGinny closet
Wild world of Balmain and Balenciagas
All cocaine sponsored,the Nextel chirp era it made monsters
This deep rooted it made mobsters
Now you break bread and we crack lobsters. (Push)

[Outro: Backyardigans]
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies, pies?
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies?
Yes, I wanna make
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies, pies?
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies?
Yes, I wanna make
