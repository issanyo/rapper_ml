[Verse 2: Simpleton]
Yo! Ah! Ah! People sell dem soul a for a slice of bread
Don't watch how man business may get eye turn red
Pay attention to like how easy man dead
It's ready been written man it's ready been said
Mi travel a thousand miles just to lick a guy head
Yuh might pick up teflon mixed with led
Don't get mi angry mon or neither fled
Nuff snitches a work for CIA and feds
We beat 'em badly and mek di whole a dem dead
And this di original di badily boom skegereg
Freestyle fanatic, stayin quietly in da attic
Spittin like a damn automatic
So let mi tell yuh straight a like elastic
Watch how yuh start it, let mi tell yuh fo real yo
Gimme yo a chance, mek yo di nuff a dem dance
Let mi tell yuh full of nuff grands, let mi tell yuh still yes di shine
Now what I claim what is mine, let mi tell yuh leave that designed
Special in crime, grindin fly
