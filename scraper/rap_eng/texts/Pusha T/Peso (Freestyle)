[Verse 1]
Since we on the topic, let me be obnoxious
Bitch that ain’t no paper, that shit fit in pockets
These Balenciagas, Philip Lim, the joggers
This ain’t just no style war, this right here is Shottas
Look at how these watches, hold these diamonds hostage
I just paid that ransom, stuntin’ on you biatches
We shoppers, you bloggers, if money talks, you mumblers
You try it on then take it off, then post a pic on yo Tumblrs
We tumblers, we acrobats, we jugglers
We flip that, it somersault, we get it back cuz we hustlers
It’s heatin’ up, we fired up like Waco
They place the order, we cross the border with pesos
