[Chorus: Rivers Cuomo]
Girl, we're too young, don't give up on life
Don't, don't stop believin'
Girl, we're too young, don't give up on life
Don't, don't stop believin'

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Look at you, art girl
You live in the art world
Attracted to boys in the hood
We pick you apart, girl
She like 'em Chief Keef
She like 'em tattooed
She like to roll leaf
She like 'em mad rude, talkin' 'bout cash rules
Takin' selfies in the mirror (woo!)
Get the angle, make it clearer (woo!)
That ain't perfect, girl, ain't no perfect world
Why we takin' life so serious?
The past is the past and it's old
The future is bright and it's bold
Bigger goals, bigger Rolls
Bigger stage, bigger shows

[Chorus: Rivers Cuomo]
Girl, we're too young, don't give up on life
Don't, don't stop believin'
Girl, we're too young, don't give up on life
Don't, don't stop believin'

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
We grew up on fairytales
No wonder we're dreamers
Rejection, know very well
They didn't believe us
We made 'em believers
You thought you ain't need us
How you gon' stop us now?
The youth are leaders
Innovators
They can't see you 'cause they're imitators
We made a lane of our own
We ain't assimilators
Now that our house is a home
We better renovators
Color outside of the lines
Now I just demonstrate it

[Chorus: Rivers Cuomo]
Girl, we're too young, don't give up on life
Don't, don't stop believin'
Girl, we're too young, don't give up on life
Don't, don't stop believin'
Girl, we're too young, don't give up on life
Don't, don't stop believin'
Girl, we're too young, don't give up on life
Don't, don't stop believin'

[Outro: Rivers Cuomo]
Don't stop believin'
Don't stop believin'
Don't stop believin'
Don't, don't, don't-d-don't
Don't stop believin'
Don't stop believin'
Don't stop believin'
Believin', believin'
