[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
I think we can agree that the sheep in need of a leader
Made a number one what was just a feature for Rita
Sold two mill' with iSHi, I didn't need a belieber
I'm a product of the post-success, Eskimo and the Creeper
Jumping out the bushes in Stussy, nigga, we push it
Love for all my Gs, never pussyholes or the wusses
In Baoli beach, California, rolling my sushi
With so much designer wear that I look like a looky-looky
Nigga I don't buy what you selling, I sell it too
Keep it 100, I'm stunting in every room
I'm very cool, I'm cool, the very move
Feeling the sky, my type, 'Nelope Cruz
Riding round in limos, my family and I were brittle
I'm a psycho and a sicko, I'll turn your wife to a widow
Sometime when I was little been rhymin' my likkle riddles
Never used to have iCloud, I had Grilo
Numero uno, I had ain't not have a clue though
Or let me live and just give a nigga the kudos
I'm Danny Zuko, my nigga, black papi chulo
You niggas are melon short of a fruitbowl
Yard is a fortress, S-class is enormous
I don't have to beg no father for their daughters
I spoke to God and infinity's just a beat
I spoke to Pusha, I finished it to a T

[Hook: Pusha T]
Rockin' with the motherfuckin' greatest, I push it
I push it

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I've been pushin', yes, I've been cookin'
Road trips, them risks, they've been tooken
Been ballin', hoes, they been lookin'
I first class your flights, I've been bookin'
One in Bed-Stuy, she's so Brooklyn
I can't dodge her, she's so Crooklyn
They let the crooks in, we let the guns blow
All you see is bright lights through the gun smoke

[Hook: Pusha T]
