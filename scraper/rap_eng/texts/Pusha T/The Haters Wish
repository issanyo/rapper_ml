[Intro: Pusha T]
Big shout-out to the Re-Up Gang
All of the Re-Up Gang
I'm talking to my niggas in the street right now
You know, they love to hate us
You know
E-everybody in the game who
Who they've been sayin' for the past ten years is going to jail
They've been wishin' jail on us for the past ten years
That's crazy, right? Haha!
I love it though
Fuck 'em

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Tell me, how could you go against the lord's will
Count my blessings every time them Yokohama's squeal
Or that engine purr, that fur feline feel
Death to haters so I gives it to them overkill
Over kill chill in chains like field niggas
You know my roots, my history's revealed nigga
Straight fish scale, all I'm missing is gills
The ros√© spills on that eel skin [?]
Thousand gram relay, we just passin' the baton
Niggas runnin' the race just to settle for Solange (second)
Every bitch love 'em, they just sit and discuss 'em
He just they closest thing to heaven, only god's above 'em
Keep the devil below me, getting money to show me
I ride the 'rari, hopped over the Aston, I'm Kobe
They wishin' death, as they see my worth escalate
I'm driven by the disgusting niggas, so I welcome hate

[Hook]
Nothing gonna stop us now, you can't stop us
What you gonna do right now, you can't run
We need the boss in you, we've lost this year
Cause ain't nobody doing you're thing, we do, oh no
Nothing gonna stop us now, you can't stop us
What you gonna do right now, you can't run
We need the boss in you, we've lost this year
Cause ain't nobody doing you're thing, we do, oh no


[Verse 2: No Malice]
Imma leave it in my memoirs, Chauffeurs and foreign cars
Lines 'round the building the fan's paying homage
The charms resilient, the women too willin'
Barcelona, Spain on the beach, the sun's brilliant
I give to the hood, I pose with the children
Even though I got ties to the rock like a pilgrim
I got guns and papers to conceal them
Once revealed the fury is unyieldin'
'Til then, steppin' out the coupe like I'm in slow mo
Play Cloths, fucking up the game like I'm Romo
Lord knows them hoes is my Goliath
They already know, come to daddy and imma buy it
Under the palm trees, you feeded my papaya
The latest in Louie bags, [?]
[?] three times 'for the rooster crows
To the fed's it ain't mine, let the truth be told

[Hook]
Nothing gonna stop us now, you can't stop us
What you gonna do right now, you can't run
We need the boss in you, we've lost this year
Cause ain't nobody doing you're thing, we do, oh no
Nothing gonna stop us now, you can't stop us
What you gonna do right now, you can't run
We need the boss in you, we've lost this year
Cause ain't nobody doing you're thing, we do, oh no
