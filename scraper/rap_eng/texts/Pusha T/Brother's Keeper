[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Nothing's safe when your numbers change
Keep it low or pay the fee
Niggas talking but it's not too often that they living what they speak
Good pussy kept me entertained
Money came then it went away
Lord see over everything (Over everything?)
Am I my brother's keeper (Am I my brother's keeper)
You know everybody gotta eat, bruh
I wanna live on ahead, if not a cloud in the air
The right side of the chair
If Jesus would've had a better lawyer would he have to see the cross
I hope your niggas is true, I hope they don't do you like Judas
I pray to God
Pain wearing off, sleeping while I talk
Laid in the arms, woke up at the top
I wanna live on ahead, if not a cloud in the air
Right side of the chair

[Pre-Verse: Pusha T & Anderson .Paak]
9 A.M. LA time
My brother just turned down a half a million dollars
For being one half of one of the greatest duos in hip-hop history
(Am I my brother's keeper)
I couldn't love him more
(You know everybody gotta eat, bruh)
Everybody eats, B
(Am I my brother's keeper?)
King Push

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Am I my brother's keeper, they still asking 'bout the duo
Applaud his finding salvation
But I'm still rhyming 'bout the you know
It's hard to leave your foundation, this spaceship took me to Pluto
Still an underground king, but the money's Jason Derulo
Sumo in the safe, Cujo on the grill
Diamonds in the face, racing leather wheel
To all my other field niggas, you knowin' how I feel, niggas? (Woo)
Destroy and rebuild niggas
That's the only way to build nigga, yuugh
Definition of a real nigga
And the target, it ain't to kill niggas, no
Am I my brother's keeper, I'm dialing in a bit deeper
Arms reach of the reaper, they say it's cheaper to keep her
Life's a bitch

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
(How I ever, ever let you go)
(How I ever, ever let you go)
(How I ever, ever let you go)
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes, is it strange
(How I ever, ever let you go)
To be baited, shit I'm grown
(How I ever, ever let you go)
But still a fade
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Shootin' off with no marks
(How I ever, ever let you go)
If I hit, there's no mistakes, yeah
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Huh, baby
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes, daily
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Every day, ohh, ohh now
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Through change
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Every day
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Will it stay
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Will it change
(How I ever, ever let you go)
