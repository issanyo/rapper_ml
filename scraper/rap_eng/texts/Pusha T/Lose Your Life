[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Omen, listen to the flow let it take you where ya goin'

Avalanche P pushed powder till you snowed in
No in! Open sesame, unveil the recipe!
Cocaine cook-up, Heroin and Ecstasy
Got me locked in the Coupe like the Lambo's arrestin' me!
Gun play necessity, Warfare, None spared!
Duffel bag money ain't all there, we sick 'em!
All mornin' victim. - He, who test P just
Beggin' for the death walk with devilish me
Sit back, kick back; knowin' that there's none hotter!
Graduated from a drug dealer's alma mater!

You niggas got no worries; "Hakuna Matata"! (Matata!)
