[Pusha T talking]

[Hook: Pusha T]
I'm a champion, shorty I'm a champion
I been around the map, now I'm on my victory lap, hey hey
See, I'm a champion, shorty I'm a champion
While other niggas crashing em, hey I'm just steady mashing em
Tell em what you told me, tell em what you told me
Tell em what you told me, tell em what you told me
Tell em what you told me, tell em what you told me
Tell em what you told me, tell em what you told me

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They say I'm shining dog, you see these diamonds dog
They say I'm shining so hard I like to blind em dog
You got a problem dog? Well you can bring it on
I got at least a 100 shots and you can get 'em all
Hey! I did it! I really did it!
I'm like the poster child for niggas that just get it, get it
I'm supposed to smile for my niggas who ain't here to live it
I'm putting money on they books so they can ball in prison
And feel the spirit of a boss, dual pipe exhaust
All we know is to floss
I'm cocaine Cassel and throwing bombs to Moss
My bitch keeps the newest and the latest
A street nigga, she know I'm the greatest, hey, hey
Hold up that Ros√©, pouring half the bottle out
If you from where I'm from, you know why I'm showing out
Overcame the odds, so we overdue them cars
We done balled around the world
Now we reaching for the stars, hey, hey

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Malice]
If only I had gotten what I had deserved
Lord knows, I would've been done left this earth
Or either in somebody's jail, rotten, that's my word
If not yourselves, then you need to have them kids in church
Mistook my work for selling crack
You should've got more out of it then that
My Grandma would say "boy you backwards as the hat"
Rather in a trap, NFL draft pick or rap
Virginia's for hustlers, hustlers get it back
I thought that life was a bad bitch, bad car
Life is with your kids watching Madagascar
In the headrest of the H3 with crash bar
Rocking Play Cloths, every day's a catwalk

[Hook]

[Bridge]
[Pusha T]
Been there, done that, fell off, got back
Real nigga shit, only champions can talk that
Earn my respect, niggas hating cause they want that
Been to hell and back, only champions can walk that

[Malice]
Talk that, put yo money where ya mouth is
Tee off on the green, golf course is where the house is
A long way from pumping out housing projects
Investing in real estate, weighing out my prospects

[Hook]
