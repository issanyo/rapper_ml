[Hook: Pusha T]
Hey doorman, tell em line up the Cris
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch
You niggas keep waving them wrists
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch
Ye ain't got money like this
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch
So scream it if ya ambition fit
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch
(Sing it niggas)
You ain't got money like this
Paper plates on a brand new Six
I just taught my young boys how to mix
You ain't seen paper like this, nigga

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Every All-Star, every Cancun
Every holiday South Beach in full bloom
Thousand dollar suites white sheets, white rooms
I've got a bright future neck like a full moon
Buy what we want, spend what they want
Young, rich, hot nigga, everything she wants
Triple beams scales got me under deep spells
Kiss my forehead, momma knows I mean well
Cocaine bought me everything I ever had
And I ain't never been scared to spend my very last
Cause I can get it back, watch me get it back
Last 2 or 10 bricks, shit I'm cooking that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Malice]
My life's too real to be a PSA
The million in the ceiling's for a rainy day
I cut it, then whip her like she Annie Mae
Praise God I escaped by his amazing grace
Nah, never was I saving Face
Some family ties are impossible to break
The almighty judge, only he can save me
Don't cry for us now, just pray for our babies
Mercedes 5 with the open roof
Miami Hot Rods in the ocean view
The tell-tale signs that expose the truth
Lil Willy Rat King, this one's for you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Malice]
We get it in a flash like paparazzi
Cars, crib, everything big body
Big charm, hanging from my big chain
Swing side to side, feeling like I'm T-Pain
Pull up to the crib, bitch thinks she's seeing thangs
Make a hundred stacks, blow it like it's pocket change

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
If the good die young, than the greats go to jail
I miss my Tony, hope you snitches burn in hell
Kiss and tell with sales on us ballers
All because them two doors coming with big spoilers
All because them bitches is acting like they jaw-less
And we don't count money, we weigh it like fish orders

[Hook]

[Outro: Pusha T]
Doorman!
