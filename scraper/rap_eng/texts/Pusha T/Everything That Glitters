Quality street, hey, yo, French, music
You, you know I'm 'bout that life, right?
Pushin'

Better know who you is when you lookin' in the mirror
'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold
I'm gettin' love from the hater
Camera's in action, I tell all my niggers what's happenin'

Ride with my niggers
'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold
I'm gettin' love only from the haters
My camera's in action, tell all my niggers what's happenin'

With all the smoke get high, high, high
Just another day gettin' by, by, by

For every brick broke down it's one stepped on
For every known rat it's one slept on
For every loyal nigga frontin' one kept on
For every bitch I showed the way it's when they kept hoein'

So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles
Let me drop another classic and the tour follows
Let's get pissy drunk and let the hoes swallow
My niggers embrace guns and ignore Bibles

Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lines
The illusions we can be, you get a law abidin'
Better know who that is lookin' in the mirror
The truth lies and you still can't see it clear

Better know who you is when you lookin' in the mirror
'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold
I'm gettin' love from the hater
Camera's in action, I tell all my niggers what's happenin'

Ride with my niggers
'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold
I'm gettin' love only from the haters
My camera's in action, tell all my niggers what's happenin'

With all the smoke get high, high, high
Just another day gettin' by, by, by

I just can't leave it alone, I just can't leave it alone
They handin' out football numbers after tappin' your phone
Or you're watchin' for the drop
As they clap and they chrome

Took a brick and I turned it to stone
Five into ten, the return of the clones
Then took my experience and turned it to poems
As we took single engines and turned 'em to Boeings

Panamera blood red symbolized bloodshed
Lost lot of niggers, some in club fed
Few still reminiscin' in they CL
Sellin' Pete Rock, cruisin' in they V12, yeah

Better know who you is when you lookin' in the mirror
'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold
I'm gettin' love from the hater
Camera's in action, I tell all my niggers what's happenin'

Ride with my niggers
'Cause everythin' that glitter, that ain't gold
I'm gettin' love only from the haters
My camera's in action, tell all my niggers what's happenin'

With all the smoke get high, high, high
Just another day gettin' by, by, by
