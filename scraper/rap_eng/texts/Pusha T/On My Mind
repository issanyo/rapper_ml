[Verse 1: Moxie Raia]
Oh my my, oh my my
You keep playing on my mind
Think I gotta press rewind
On my mind, on my mind
Oh my my, oh my my
All I see, every sign, in between every line
All the channels all the time
On my mind, on my mind
On my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Moxie Raia]
Lost this fight, all day and night
I'm swimming in it deep
Just need you next to me
Missed five trends been here since ten
I'm caught up in the blue
And I ain’t mad about it too, ooh

[Chorus: Moxie Raia]
It's all the time
God knows I've tried
But I do not want you
No, I don't want you off my mind
Every night
Yea, it's more than fine
Cause I do not want you
No, I don't want you off my mind

[Verse 2: Moxie Raia]
On the grind, caffeinated
Boy you stay up on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
Got me thinkin' on my my
Oh my my, oh my my
Hung all up on your vibe
Laundry out on the line
Sitting here high and dry
On my mind
On my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Moxie Raia]
Lost this fight all day and night
I’m swimming in it deep
Just need you next to me
Missed five trends been here since ten
I'm caught up in the blue
And I ain’t mad about it too

[Chorus: Moxie Raia]
It’s all the time, God knows I tried
But i do not want you, no i don’t want you off my mind
Every night yea it’s more than fine
Cause i do not want you, no i don’t want you off my mind

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Names in your search box
Wonder will the hurt stop?
Washed up, older cousins always make the worst cops
Work phones in my call log
Every hour on the hour 'til she logs off
See my fashion, found another passion
'Nother way to cash in
G.O.O.D. Music captain, who's askin'?
New goals, contracts with loopholes
The president can still move Os
On your mind, maybe?
They say if the love is real, then it's blind, baby
Stevie Wonder through this thing, it's you and I, lately
That means twin Mercedes
Two doors for me and my lady, drive her crazy

[Chorus: Moxie Raia]
It’s all the time, God knows I tried
But i do not want you, no i don’t want you off my mind
Every night yea it’s more than fine
Cause i do not want you, no i don’t want you off my mind
All the time, God knows I try
But i do not want you, no i don’t want you off my mind
Every night yea it’s more than fine
Cause i do not want you, no i don’t want you off my mind
