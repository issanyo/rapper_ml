[Verse 1]
As I get hotter, haters get madder
Escalator up...fuck a ladder!
Success callin', your world's shattered
They say it's destiny; to me, it never mattered
Drug overlord, they put me over Lord
Say you gettin' money, we goin' overboard
New Years with my bitch in the Palm suite
Mink was like Ocho-Cinco with the blonde streak
The Don Dotta, the kingpin
I jump squares on you muthafuckas; king him
Lebron's on 'em, the coupe's Bond on 'em
The Aston was ice-blue, I went Tron on 'em
Now handle that, bitch, handle that
White dripping off the pot like candle wax
Let it dry then it's on to the next one
I'm Raekwon in the kitchen when I chef one

[Verse 2]
I'm light-years beyond Balenciaga pythons
You put 'em back after you try 'em on
I'm pushin' kilos; it's a pie-a-thon
Forklifting the palate, nigga, pile it on
Cocaine cowboys, no spurs, but I'm stylin' on
Every bird got my talons on
Run the Late Night, get my Jimmy Fallon on
Request love (With ?uestlove) on that price that they peggin' on
I beat a different drum
G.O.O.D. Music, but I speak it with a different tongue
The numb one becomes number 1
See us Grammy night; bow ties and cummerbunds
Ciroc soak bad bitch, I'm layin' under one
Make her work for it, night nurse for it
In the morning she can get her heel and purse for it
Witch-doctor flow, you could say I'm cursed for it
The way I'm killin' shit, you should send a hearse for it
Push!
