[Hook]
And I move it and keep you straight
If it wasn't sellin' weight, I break that whole bitch down an eighth
If it's really that imported shit, you purchase up the state
If I drop it, it don't take that bitch the next time we gon'

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, I tell 'em hurry up and buy
Nigga try to rob me, he gon' hurry up and die
I buy a chopper every year, like it's a summer line
I spend a quarter on my dime
When we leave the mall the car turn to Optimus Prime
And I'm buying irons for her little dog
But she hop on the dick like a bullfrog
And I move this shit like a U-Haul
Got a room full of hard, no RuPaul

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fast Life]
007 missions, I'm a street marine
My chopper from the navy, all my drugs be ocean clean
I call the molly salt, bath salt machine
I drove up in from Colorado with that powder spring
Orange County, flip pounds from Spartanburg
And we from country nigga, we move slow from sippin syrup
First I sip and surf, then I sip and swerve
Take a nigga face off if he interrupt my pitching curve
All I think is money, I spend more cash than your family earn
My money make money so beef is what my shooters earn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
One brick, two brick, three bricks, four
80k to play every time I go to score
He gotta charge me extra if he bring it to my door
I'm in my house slippers, here take that 40 more
I recompress it, powder stretches
Double Jeopardy, Alex Trebek it
Turn one to two, from two to coups
Spend a day in Dior to fuck a Betty Boop
Razors at my fingertips, on my Freddie Krueg'
Ain't no safeties on the choppas we gon' let 'em loose

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tom Foolery]
I don't sell dope, but I move keys
And you can get the whole piano for 300 Gs
Straight drop, you know I'm talkin' 808
Whip it in a pyrex jar, move production out of state
The federalis lookin' cause the whip cost me a half a mil'
And they pussy, I'mma send that ass a massive yield
The roof butterfly, I push the button it Caterpillar
I say I worked with Eminem, they think I'm passin' pills
Look, a hundred geeks, keep the dope on the hard drive
Cut the cheque, split up the money like apartheid
