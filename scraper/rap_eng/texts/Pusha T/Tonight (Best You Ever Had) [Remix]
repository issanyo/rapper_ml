[Verse 1: John Legend]
Ain’t this what you came for
Don’t you wish you came more
Girl what you playing for, come on
Come on, let me kiss that
Oooh, know you miss that
What’s wrong let me fix that
Twist that

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby tonight’s the night I let you go
Baby tonight’s the night we lose control
Baby tonight you need that
Tonight believe that
Tonight I’ll be the best you ever had
I don’t want to brag but I’ll be
The best you ever had
I don’t want to brag but I’ll be
The best you ever had

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I hit you with the best stroke
Freestyle and the breast stroke
‘Til you blowing cigarette smoke
And now the beds broke
So what we gon’ do now
Fuckin' Round Two now
Work it out then we cool down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha-T]
Might not pull your chair out
Calendars I clear out
No relaxers, I pay to grow your hair out
His and her everything pull ‘em pairs out
Them pink pink Louboutin's, pull them reds out
Never sweat air fare when the lear's near
Through the clouds sky blue like a care bear
Your first time you a virgin to these airlines
I don’t mean to brag but compare mine
Roadsters, chauffeurs, take your pick
Have ya kickin’ either two, baby make a wish
Anything you ever wanted you could make a list
The only reason you ain’t got it ‘cuz it don’t exist
Took a chance, hit or miss
Homerun, friends with benefits
We fight and make love I like you better mad
Truly yours, "the best you ever had"

[Hook]
