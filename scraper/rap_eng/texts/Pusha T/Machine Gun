King Push

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
D boy, dark side, stash money, archive
R.I.P. nigga, that's me nigga, that's all eyes
Seein' me with them hoes, seein' me in them clothes
I'm settled in, I'm settin' trends, they TMZin' my pose
Doors up, hard top, money, cash, that's hard knock
Life foul, this lifestyle, I'm documentin' it right now
G.O.O.D. Music, God level, goes hard for the whole game
All white everything, my hands dirty with cocaine

[Hook]
Machine gun
Machine gun

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Daredevil, stunt man, fly nigga, you jumpman
G5s we jump start, with the Joker smile on that front end
Fist in, might sit twelve, you ain't talking no thick hoes
If you like me? That's 2 niggas and 6 bitches in tight clothes
"Mo' money, mo' problems" motto don't mean much
All gold everything, not Trinidad, nigga, King Tut
King Push, kilo, I'm the voice of it, Cee Lo
Machine gun, Steve-O, it's just as big as my ego

[Hook]
