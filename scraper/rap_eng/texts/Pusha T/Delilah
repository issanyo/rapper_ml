[Verse 1: Tim Omaji]
She wants to make it in the city
She always coming to the show
Soon as the lights go down
She waiting for me at the door
She doesn't care that I'm taken
She likes it better this way
My mind is yelling just run
But my body's wantin' her to stay

[Pre-Chorus: Tim Omaji]
Oh girl, I'm faded and I can't take it
I wanna have you in the worst way, baby
What am I sayin', misbehavin'
Defense is failin'

[Hook: Tim Omaji]
I'm falling for your love Delilah
Delilah (Delilah)
Girl, you're killing me
Don't need it or want it, don't need it or want it
Don't need it or want it, don't need it
I'm dying from your touch, Delilah
Delilah (Delilah)
But I don't wanna leave
Don't need it or want it, don't need it or want it
Don't need it or want it, don't need it
I'm falling for your love

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I don't blame her, I don't change her
I just sit back and give her options
Shoe-shopping, bag-buying
Color-schemes will be the only problem (What colour?)
She just wanna know the main supplier
Shooting guard or a man on fire
Type a nigga with a moneybag
And a little swag, if you plan on tryin'
Man, keep it low, keep it quiet
Phone ring and she on silent
Love my girl, leave her more than asked
So she sent me home at a decent hour
Ain't no fun if it ain't no balance (no)
Ain't no chase if it ain't no challenge (no)
Juggle ball is like a circus act
Called Nick Cannon cause she got talent

[Hook: Tim Omaji]
I'm falling for your love Delilah
Delilah (Delilah)
Girl, you're killing me
Don't need it or want it, don't need it or want it
Don't need it or want it, don't need it
I'm dying from your touch, Delilah
Delilah (Delilah)
But I don't wanna leave
Don't need it or want it, don't need it or want it
Don't need it or want it, don't need it
I'm falling for your love

[Pre-Chorus: Tim Omaji]
Oh girl, I'm faded and I can't take it
I wanna have you in the worst way, baby
What am I sayin', misbehavin'
Defense is failin'

[Hook: Tim Omaji]
I'm falling for your love Delilah
Delilah (Delilah)
Girl, you're killing me
Don't need it or want it, don't need it or want it
Don't need it or want it, don't need it
I'm dying from your touch, Delilah
Delilah (Delilah)
But I don't wanna leave
Don't need it or want it, don't need it or want it
Don't need it or want it, don't need it
I'm falling for your love
