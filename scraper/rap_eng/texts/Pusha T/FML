[Intro: August Alsina]
All you gotta do it get it one time, one time
For all my niggas, for my niggas
For my niggas too

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Wake up feelin' like fuck my life, life's a bitch, she better fuck me right
Lost my love in this losin' game, when the feds came, it's like I lost my wife
Nigga losin' weight as I'm losin' time
See I took a loss, see I lost a mill then I lost my mind
Over-conversated with them hoes, overcompensated with them hoes
Overdid it like it's over-time, told her run the tab 'til she overdose
Alpina, Alsina, King Push like King Tut
Made niggas to you middle men, you get middle fingers, we don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Let me tell you 'bout my self, I'm not scared to die
Been through so much shit, sometimes I wanna be in the sky
Wanna know how it feels to fly, wanna know how it feels to fly
I'm scared of hello, I ain't scared of goodbye

[Hook: August Alsina]
I never thought that I would be here
I never thought I'd get this far
If they say life is like a beach chair
Then why am I sitting in the dark?
Sometimes I just feel like fuck my life, fuck my life
Even when I'm up I'm feeling down, fuck my life
Half the niggas locked up or underground, fuck my life, fuck my life
Sometimes I just feel like fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life

[Verse 3: August Alsina]
See I grew up in the jungle, where everybody broke
A lot of niggas never make it, all they know is selling dope
Life ain't easy in the Easy, murder capital
Might not make it here tomorrow, like I'm running outta hope

[Hook: August Alsina]
I never thought that I would be here
I never thought I'd get this far
If they say life is like a beach chair
Then why am I sitting in the dark?
Sometimes I just feel like fuck my life, fuck my life
Even when I'm up I'm feeling down, fuck my life
Half the niggas locked up or underground, fuck my life, fuck my life
Sometimes I just feel like fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life
