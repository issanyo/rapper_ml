[Intro:]
Hahahahaha
Yeah, King Push, you know I'm undefeated right?

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
36 and 0, kilo champ, I'm undefeated
36 them O's, triple beam, that's underneath it
Dope all in my flows, day one, you best believe it
Kept pure in they nose, never stepped on, used to burnin' breathin'
Ugh, that's raw baby, had to chop it with the saw baby
Used to send them bitches in voodoo dolls, never met the plug but the (?) in Haiti
Then I Holy Ghost as I overdose on this truth nigga
Let 'em see the proof, all the colored diamonds on my noose nigga
Hublot, khujo, that Rottweiler Givenchy
Rubber bands, a couple fans, 400 grand in my Aunties
Snake brim that's Don C, backyard, them palm trees
Phillip Lim, leather goods, my collar's up, I'm Fonzie
Drumroll, 80 rounds that drum holds
Full automatic marching band, my drum line leave dumb hoes
Drumroll, 80 rounds that drum holds
Full automatic marching band, my drum line leave dumb hoes

[Hook: Pusha T]
Kilo champ I'm undefeated, I'm undefeated, drumroll
Kilo champ I'm undefeated, I'm undefeated, drumroll
Kilo champ I'm undefeated, I'm undefeated, drumroll
Kilo champ I'm undefeated, I'm undefeated, drumroll

[Verse 2: Mayalino]
Nigga, I'm paid, two stack on J's
I keep powder in the hood like Kool Aid
Military cake and your whole crew fake
Nigga give me a fade
If I lose the fade, I come back with a 30 shot Ruger man
Mine (?), where's Houston man
Like ugh, got Rollie on, got Gucci on, got Louis Vetton
Like ugh, got 'Sace on, got yellow dome from a yellow bone
Like ugh, black sweater on, go (?) bone, black but my (?) chrome
My (?) brick, you o for o, you snitch bitch
I'm Al Capone, Ben Franks, Ben Jordans
Motherfucker I've been ballin'
I ain't pickin' up the phone when the Feds callin'
Got a gold plated chopper with the diamonds on it
100 keys of the coke nigga, they come from me
I ain't gonna lie cause the money right here I spent that money like ugh
I'm from the south, talk crack (?) amounts
Put that gold all in our mouths
Put that pistol right in your mouth
What you said? You ain't sellin' bricks, you ain't buyin' whips
You ain't got no chain, you ain't got no watch, you a pussy bitch
I ain't live like this

[Hook: Pusha T]

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Undefeated in dope talk
Run up talkin' that shit bitch, you hoes bout to get broke off
I've been sellin' that dope soft, broads fuck with that white bitch
I get bread in that drop head, shoeboxes of that light shit
Niggas know how this life get, lost a lot in these streets though
Popped his ass with that (?) rock, shot his ass with that 3-4
36, nigga fuck that
I don't fuck with that cuz shit, all of mine better come back
Tellin' ya'll that I'm undefeated
Tellin' ya'll that I come bleedin'
In this game I got stripes on me
I'm so real, got a price on me
As solid as they ever came
Money wasn't everything
Greedy niggas went with quickness
And died for nothin' in this wishful business

[Hook: Pusha T]
