[Verse 1: Ab Liva]
Man there’s rules to the hustle gotta get in and get it off
Get it cross borders, slip it in then whip it soft
Water off  when it dries break it down get it tossed
Young boys hug corners all night get it off
Get it on niggas on your strip has to give a lotta
(9 millimeter go bang) then you get it lost
Give and go getting that guap homie get it floss
Make double-puppy fly over what you get it cost
The price is all right, soft right
Brighter than the glare from the Porsche lights, Porsche pass em as I revolve
Counter clockwise back step over you rap niggas I evolved
Ie; I solved, the riddle that
Hip-hop is dead but we resurrect the beat in the shroud
Hatin' niggas try to block your shine like the clouds
But I Will' Wallace scream "freedom!" through the clouds, so loud

[Verse 2: Malice]
Ask and you shall receive says the lord
Bless me ten-fold then repo'd the Porsche
Since when minx stows a means for divorce
Instead you rather cling like your life raft was tossed
Had to fly back, the must have the coins
Jimmy Choos, nice calves, I type cast my broads
Tryin' to live with little less remorse
Telling my trophy wife these bitches just rewards
And the law don’t understand our truth
We gon’ never say shit we the blueman group
We gon’ tuck it in that bitch like a kangaroo
Then switch to '06 to the right now cool
So clean custom bent
Got the nerve to step bout it like I’m discontent
You whole look at me like a ship’s command
Would have once engaged but I have since repent

[Hook: Sandman]
And I’m just living my life stride by stride I rock where it takes me
And it ain’t nothing  rock this shit all out until it breaks me
And I ain’t goin’ nowhere fuck that trust that you won’t make me
R-E-U-P-G-A-N-G

[Verse 3: Sandman]
I’m talking paper, Sixers versus Lakers
Drop a dolla when it holla, collect me shoot the Vegas
Pop a jet, couple seconds I'm shooting shakers
Velvet tables sexy bellies and perfect [?]
And my staples, look at their faces they drive me wild
Pay your pounds, they get freaky like Jada fire
It's on bread big head bills they switch wheels
Like crib hills and chick heels but then still
Banana pill on em, [?] and the clip making these niggas sick
Screamin’ life is a bitch
Eye fuck her down, [?] pick one
If you bread there, it ain't shit the ship 'em
[?] is your order, I chip ‘em
Down to the squirrel I’m real thorough
Run a real tight system
Show my face, clear our space
Lyricate call me Boosie, bread off base

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
Yuugh! Make the whole city numb
Test it on your gums only buy it out the drum
Sell it how I come protect the line that it's from
He who says names, redrum redrum
We walk to the beat of the warrior’s drum
We ran through the circles, the notorious run
We never stood a chance see the morals were shun
Cuz the feds couldn’t stop what the couriers brung
The older hustlers live like a glorious ones
Lasting impression question no ignoring they sums
Good things gotta end snitches ruin their run
Now the foundations laid  and competitions is none
They called us young, dumb and so full of promise
I say we was rich, fucking with maybe we was young
Tell me what that matter if you can’t match his ones
They see the evolution of the man Pusha Ton, welcome
