[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Hey, do you have any black inside you?
Would you like some? (Like some?)
Ha, you know you got a right to do whatever you like to
Don C, we got the right one, that right one
In the club, always the flyest, always got her hands the highest
She stopped drinking Diet Coke, she on that coke diet
She bat, she bat her eyelids, that girl is so wired
I know she so tired, but ooh, she on fire
Hundred dollar bills, look at you, look at you
A hundred dollar bills, this ain't new, this ain't new
From that Paris, Lindsay, Britney, Mary-Kate and Whitney
People say that they clean, motherfucker, don't bullshit me

[Chorus: Shay Haley]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
You left your nigga home, you said you at your sister's
You and your girlfriends' wrong, you in here taking pictures
You ain't gotta tell us you spending Daddy's cash
Your girlfriend's jealous you got the fattest ass
One dying to pee, one trying to leave
It's hot as fuck, but you just dying to ski
It's clear as black and white, like a fat panda
Your brain is Magic City, your nose is Atlanta
I said, "Think 'bout your future, you can't do that tomorrow"
But you don't hear a word, you see that SLR
You like, "Hey, Pharrell, I ain't trying to kill your mood
But I can do the Star Trek sign, see? Killa dude"

[Chorus: Shay Haley]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Now she got high hopes, just to say hi to us
She want the high life, she like them higher ups
She know we high rolling, she know it's high stakes
That's why she high speeding, out on that highway
She say she high maintenance, she say she high fashion
She say she high priced, I think she high cappin'
She had her high heels, I had my high tops
Sipping a Hi-C, eatin' no Hydrox
I asked her, "How it feel up on this high rise?"
She said, "This high score, this was the highlight"
She got her hi-Pod bumpin' her hi-Tunes
This higher education, welcome to high school

[Chorus: Shay Haley]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
Yugh! Like I got a crown made of powder
Everybody knows who the king of the coke flow be
All I hear is "Oh, key", every line is "Oh, key"
All you rappers okey-dokey
Nigga, you don't paint pictures
I paint Murakamis on you niggas
And Daimer Speedy Bag, bitches
Buy and sell, I can accommodate your clientele
Shamu weight, motherfucker, breaks your scales
P to the Usha, with a name like that, what you look for?
More or less like P with the hook up
Hit me on the bat phone if you want it cooked up
Ride with me, as I'm switching lane to lane
In my Play Cloths as I'm grippin' grain
In a hail of bullets how I write my name
Whether soft or hard, motherfucker, 'caine is 'caine

[Chorus: Shay Haley]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
