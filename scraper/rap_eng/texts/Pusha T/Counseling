[Hook: Pharrell]
Look at that ass just bouncing
Oh God, I need counseling
Images in my head steady hounding
Oh God, I need counseling
You don't want to bring your chicks around him
Oh God, I need counseling
How many chicks do I got? I'm still counting
Man, I need counseling

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Hey! I think I got a problem problem
And I need an open ear to try to solve 'em
Having a hard time picking out my darling
So until then I guess I juggle all 'em
Nah, I ain't gonna beg my pardon
'Cause I don't shop for none ya'll bitches at Arden
B, sippin' on a sweet as a Chardonnay
I balls, I don't bargain, see
I used to be all about a fat ass
Then I found a cutie with a flat ass
Good head, nice smile but her flat ass
Two out of three, shit, I couldn't let that pass
Doc, what you gon' about this?
'Cause I ain't got a clue about this
I'm use to getting what I want, when I want, where I want, how I want
Then them girls holler "You ain't shit!"

[Verse 2: Malice]
So many chicks, I can't pick a favorite
My shrink even say my behavior's sick
The hips to how shawty lick her lips
Just a few thoughts that come to mind as a reminisce
Temptation always been my nemesis
A few sips then take her back to my premises
Innocence lost once again
How can we be more than friends?
Baby don't be mad, think back of the fun that we had
The love we share is so cheap like a E-Class
You ain't alone, I too am a sleaze bag
I guess I need Celebrity Rehab because
Ain't no Real Chance at Love
All my wrongdoings forbid me to trust
Oh God, forgive me for lust
Don't let another heart get crushed, come on

[Bridge: Nicole]
Caught, you sneaking in the doorway late last night
But I ain't got the will to try and fight
These bitches steady hounding
Think you better go to counseling
Tame the beast you keep inside

[Verse 3: Pusha T + Malice]
Yo, maybe I'm crazy, maybe, just maybe
It's hard finding time, can't tell me I'm lazy
The way my phone ring may seem a bit shady
I'm 'bout my cash money, ma, maybe it's baby
How you persuade me via email?
Fresh out the shower, sending pics from your cell
Wishing I was there taking a flick myself
And then hit delete, I can't afford to leave a trail
