[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Like I'm playing run, catch kiss, but he don't miss
I got my sights on one, he don't fish
Lay it out for my baby, she don't wish
Take it how I really feel and put a beat on this
It's the thrill of the chase, the real from the fake
A good girl's risk is the chills and the shakes, woo
You can't love what you can't hold
Better yet you can't tame what you can't mold, Push

[Hook: Joel Compass (Pusha T)]
I'm gonna let you run, let you run away
Let you run away, as far as love can take
And I want to let you in, so you can run away
You can run away, as far as I can take
Oh, oh (where you running to?) oh

[Link: Joel Compass]
How am I supposed to love, when all you ever do is run?
Cause one minute you're there and the next you're gone

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Let's just face it, love's not basic
I won't chase it, let's embrace it
Questions are trying my patience
No, I won't fuck on that waitress
I don't know how long I can take this
Running in place trying to pace this
All I see is time being wasted
So I'mma let you run, cause I ain't here to ride you
Listen to the hook, let J. Compass guide you, Push
