[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
So many watches, I need a time capsule
Combine all my thoughts, make my mind travel
Graduated from the streets, that's beyond tassel
In my muscle car, maybe we should arm wrestle
I'm raw, using all caps, I got A on my ballcaps
No, I didn't do it but I thought about it
If I would have did it, it would have chalk around it
Yellow tape, never hesitate
2 Chainz derived from Section 8
Meditate, that's my stress relief
I've been stylin' on 'em since a lease, preach

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
My pop told me men don't cry
Then he turned around and died on me
So I didn't know what else to do
But motherfuckin' cry, homie
Oh yeah, I'm God's son
Tell Nas he got more than one
And me, I got more to see, more to be
Order three, started with a quarter ki'
I'm so ill I need penicill'
Rockin' ice cubes, talkin' kill at will
And these days, you can't tell who is really real
Ridin' on some Emmitt Smith's, long way from Emmett Till

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
Streets love a nigga, got a D-boy membership
We do it from the heart, I hope art aunt will remember this
Coke on all sentences, cold but no fridge in this
Note to all witnesses, lie or die infamous
My style is so infamous, my style, it needs censorship
Dealer, what's the business? Don't call, I'm busy bitch
Unless you 'bout your business, I'm tryna get some Benjamins
Niggas say a lot on their way to the top
But you know you're too hot when they kidnap your pops so
I guess that's sayin' a lot
But we ain't sayin' much, we just sendin' them shots, nigga

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
Death of a dynasty
I'm talkin' major, not the minor league
And you the last of a dyin' breed
Follow caine like a menace to society
The richest nigga in the city cosignin' me
My shampoo days done showed me the way
As I pray, lord willin' but the killer's still vague
How can there be closure when the shooter's still in questionin'?
Your niggas got rich but when you died them niggas owed you
And everything I see is adding up to what you told me
I'm ramblin', tryna keep it to myself, I'm scramblin'
Still hard to hold the tears back
Never saw what I became, can't get them years back
Death before dishonor

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will
