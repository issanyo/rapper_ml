[Verse 1: Elliot]
G train on the weekend, speed up and slow down
Gather in, gather in, get off this train or you’re gonna go back uptown
G train on the weekend, there’s no way out
Traveling traveling, it’s 2am and I thought I'd be home by now

[Pre-Chorus: Elliot]
What am I doing this for?
I followed you to your door
I should've already known
To keep going on home

[Chorus: Richard]
Love, I gotta warn you
I'm starting to catch onto
What you make me go through (Lets get goin' or I'm gone)
I've been losing patience
Mind is always changing
Back and forth, I'm waiting (Let get goin' or I'm gone forever)

[Verse 2: Ben]
G train on the weekend, hummin' real low
A lullaby for the guy who fell down nearby cause he did a bit too much blow
G train on the weekend, just me and my head
Wondering why you deny my love when I keep on running back to your side

[Pre-Chorus: Ben]
What am I doing this for?
I followed you to your door
I should've already known
To get going on home
You told me don't take it too fast
Cause you got an ugly past
I think I could help but you don't
I guess I'll get goin' on home

[Chorus: Richard]
Love, I gotta warn you
Starting to catch onto
What you make me go through (get going or I'm gone)
I've been losing patience
Mind is always changing
Back and forth I'm waiting (Let's get goin' or I'm gone forever)

[Bridge]
I won’t, I won't wait here
I won't wait here for you (yeah)
I won’t (let's talk about it), I won't wait here (King Push)
I won't wait here for you to get on board (it's just a conversation)

[Bridge: Pusha T]
Time's ticking, I'm waiting as I'm wishing
While you sitting on your hands as your mind switching
Expecting me to stick around while you side-picking
You can't chase the G train once I'm missing
What's to debate? I'm the obvious win
You see your NFL player only calls you a friend
While your basketball nigga only calls for events
And your personal trainer can't afford you these gyms
I know that everyone alive has a past
And you know that they ain't confident, they gon' ask
And he know that he won't stick around for the crash
And we know that I'm the only one that's gonna last (yeah)

[Chorus: Richard] (x2)
Love, I gotta warn you
Starting to catch onto
What you make me go through (get going or I'm gone)
I've been losing patience
Your mind is always changing
Back and forth I'm waiting (get going or I'm gone forever)

[Outro]
Hoppin' on the G train, in and out of Brooklyn
Come and let my love in, I could take you places
Hoppin' on the G train, in and out of Brooklyn
Come and let my love in, I could take you places
