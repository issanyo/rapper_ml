[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Look, I kept it 24-karat
Repeat after me like a parrot
You heard you want, I know what I said
So now we gotta wear it
The miscommunicators gotta share it—uh, uh, uh
Convos led to two different condos
You can’t get the new keys or the combos
No gate codes, I run down
Call before you come ‘fore the sun come down, uh
See, I know that things got blurry
And, nah, this ain’t your average rapper jewelry
And, yeah, your girlfriend got married
But, shit, her nigga beat her, she ain’t happy
It’s easy to say but harder to do
Outside looking in, it’s a wonderful view…woo
The most beautifullest thing if the truth’s told
But you could find another fool if you Fool’s Gold
Push

[Verse 2: Jill Scott]
Oh, silly me my dear for thinking that you'd stay
Gave you my heart and then you ran away
Either I'm stupid, I'm foolish or you're playing me
But it seems we were never really meant to be
(So I thought I would try something new)
I wanted to find out if I could live happy without you
And it turned out I wasn't living at all
But I would have never known if you had just played along

[Chorus]
I was living the dream, believing things that just ain't true
Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing Fools Gold
I was chasing Fools Gold
I was chasing Fools Gold

[Verse 3: Jill Scott]
Somewhere deep down inside I knew you wasn't right
But breaking your spell was a plan I never devised
I would have been here forever living for you
But I would have been living forever as your fool, oh

[Chorus]
I was living the dream, believing things that just ain't true
Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing Fools Gold
I was chasing Fools Gold
I was chasing Fools Gold

[Bridge]
I bit into the apple
I took the wooden nickel, yeah
I was blinded to my core
And I went into the wrong door
And further more

[Chorus]
I was living the dream, believing things that just ain't true
(I was living the dreams, oh)
Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you (I can't believe)
You had me chasing Fools Gold (I ever believed in you)
I was chasing Fools Gold (I was chasing Fools Gold)
I was chasing Fools Gold (Fools Gold)

I was living the dream, believing things that just ain't true
(I was living dreams, oh)
Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you
(I can't believe I ever believed in you)
You had me chasing Fools Gold
I was chasing Fools Gold (I was chasing Fools Gold)
I was chasing Fools Gold (Fools Gold, oh)

I was living the dream, believing things that just ain't true
Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing Fools Gold
I was chasing Fools Gold
I was chasing Fools Gold
