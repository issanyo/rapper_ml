[Verse 1: Pusha T]
King Push, drop classics
Like A.I., no practice
More [?] with 'em, no traffic
Dollar for dollar, motherfuckers eye matchin'
Produce the beat, I [?] tax it
Jigga flow, now who better than [?]?
Pusha tone, huh?
Mack Wilds here
Big dog, who?
Salaam Remi, yeah

[Hook: Mack Wilds]
We can take it back to my crib
We can get away no photographs
Chilling all alone, in my home, what you on?
My crib, if you wanna roll, let's roll
Why you tryna front? You know what you want

[Verse 2: Mack Wilds]
Who's this I see?
Brown eyes, 5'3
Legs right, ass tight
Just what I need to make my night right
And I need some change
Money come and go like planes
You a fly dime, what's your name?

[Bridge: Mack Wilds]
Cause you're looking like a perfect love song
Girl, you got me going with your clothes on
We could do this right here, but that'd be so wrong
So what you say? Girl, won't you roll my way?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mack Wilds]
And I feel no shame
I want you, don't play
All types of sweet things
Jump from my lips 'til you wanna roll, babe
Come meet me downtown
Send your girls home now
I'm homebound, what you say?
Cause I'm really wanting you to stay

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
You know what I'm about, fly it out
Personal shopper, buy it out
Test driving, try it out
I give both with the [?]
Pick a property, let's play monopoly
P-H means nobody's on top of me
360 views, over looks the water
Got it feeling like a cruise

[Hook]
