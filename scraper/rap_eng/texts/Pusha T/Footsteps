[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Follow the leader, exhaust pipes and breathers
The flash from the barrel turns bullies to believers
The time of a life make the bitches wanna keep ya
This is my reality, want it? Well let me teach ya
Follow my footsteps through tragedy and triumph
Through flows give you mein k√§mpf
Kilos consigned 'em, do as I say like Simon
And you too will diamond blind hun
I'm on my Dylan, Dillinger flow just killing ya
You wonder why the real ain't feeling ya, you're frauding
I Mason jar Martin Margiela them O's together
Since Hov was name dropping Charles Jourdan
I kept them nodding, snorting
Slobbing, barfing, and bought cars off them
The realest rapper that's unwrapping got them
If you can fit these shoes than walk them
I parked them

[Hook: Kobe]
I could have been a goner but I had to save my soul
I'm out here chasing my dreams, looking for a place to go
Trying to get up out the ghetto, come follow with my footsteps
Put down the heavy metal and follow in my footsteps
Cause if you don't, it might be danger

[Verse 2: Malice]
It's not for you to do what I do, rather do what I say
These footsteps could lead you astray
Lead you to the cell or lead you to a grave
Either way, you might never see the light of day
Don't let my wrongs give you the right of way
To emulate my past escaping the law's grasp
Told you the truth, yet who was I to brag?
Especially seeing how Kimani finds it hard to laugh
I miss my homie by she's missing her dad
It weighs on my conscience and I hate conscious rap
Apart from that, I wish to see you succeed
So I speak to my people in spirit of chuck D
You behind the glass, trust me, it cut deep
And the words to every verse haunted me in my sleep
So now what you see is Malice's contradiction
He who has ears, I hope you're listening, come on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Malice]
Follow me like Twitter nigga, you can check the timeline
I'm the quiet one but my intellect is Einstein
I'm so unnerved by the shit that I've observed
Just looking at you coons got a nigga lost for words
Verge of insanity, I'm at my crossroads
Shame on the birds that led em like lost souls
We got it wholesale, we move it like Cosco's
Mercy on the court left us standing here heart broke

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
I taught you how to cut it, cook it on hot stove
I taught you how to share them when fucking with hot hoes
I taught you how to rock right shit up on your toes
I taught you how to smile for the camera when heartbroke
I've been the inspiration for all you industry dick tasters
To your local dream chaser I am King Push
I set the stage for all these triple beam hooks
I weighed mountains while them niggas just sang hooks (yuugh)

[Bridge: Kobe]
Oh, oh, oh, your mama said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, your grandmama said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, your baby sister said
Oh, oh, oh, your nigga said
Oh, oh, oh, now your whole block said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, your old teacher said
Oh, oh, oh, your misses said
Oh, oh, oh, your preacher said, yeah

[Hook]
