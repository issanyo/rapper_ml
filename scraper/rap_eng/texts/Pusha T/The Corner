[Intro: Ab Liva]
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh

[Verse 1: Ab-Liva]
Up on the corner selling hard like mortar
With loiter
Selling that poison
Dope fiend exploiter
My rented cars
The shell hiding dope
Cops avoid em
Annoy em
Reppin my hood
My skin I embroidered
We cop toys to circle the block
We convoy 'em to blaze
Simply amazing
The young cats enjoy 'em
??? your watch
If they deploy 'em
You got the drop and no sign of that rock
That shit destroy 'em
The young thinkers I employ 'em
See we're cut from the same cloth

[Verse 2: Pusha-T]
You should see that motherfucking water boiling on the stove
And those white things floating like it's alka-seltzer cold
They say drugs is a beating so go ahead belt your nose
Or drop it in the pipe and watch it melt into the hole
Crack house like 4am casino, somewhere way out in vegas
All money make you a player
Rolling your life away, smoking your life away
Or go hypodermic nigga, dope it with the white and beige
Speedballing ain't good, recalling
I put Jojo Dancer in them flames, well he bought it
So many nights mama went to bed nauseous
Not that I was involved but her oldest son had fallen
Victim to the pipe dream, I'm lord to the bright lane
The xenon light things, the chain is like lightning
V told me put my first quarter in the ceiling
He meant a quarter million
You niggas thinking like children

Hook:
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh
Hiding dope in the ceiling, killing
Willing, trying to make a million
Uh uh, uh uh uh

[Verse 3: Malice]
I'm as dapper as a five on the black hand side
Not even a major label could dampen my stride
Never sacrifice the pride, CEO was Jive talking
I revert to the block from whence all this derived
Heavy with the metal black dual action slide
A few O's shy, you think? Dude let him slide
I'm Emeril with the pot, staring in the pot
Then add that fire to it, BAM! kick it up a notch
I'm handy with koch, I don't deal with the suits
The hen lays golden eggs, who could be so aloof?
Run check the numbers, that's proof enough for me
I am Malcolm with the flow, by any means I'mma eat
First time out the gate nigga's a grammy nominee
But whether rapping or crack, momma's still proud of me
Using her good dishes, leaving them powdery
And that blow in your nose got you sniffing like allergy

[Verse 4: Sandman]
The corner was something my momma kept me banned from
Saying no doubt them dollars would hold me ransom
Only releasing me to frequently be in the
Maybe with the melee, chasing the fast pay day
Come here day-daddy, I ain't going no where
Just up the corner with Brian
I'm lying, only twelve
Trying to inhale the smell they was firing
Hearing them say "pass that"
Watching my uncle, how them yellow cat packs
Rocking them ???
Sweatsuits, its like the corner like swept through
My body and soul and hit me like wool
Officer slow, I'm sixteen and out of control
Momma was right, truly I had to do me
???
Me cheech, gutting Ds, always outside
The corner was live, before ???
I couldn't trust it no more, shit was different
Damn, I grew up with them boys, nigga snitchin
So I switched it, mhm, hop on 9 pound
With my quad pound
With that said, its that bread I must obtain
I yeah I know I stay high, and I'm on my game
And daddy got drive like he bleed octane
He not sane, if I don't see my change
Y'all gonna bleed my pain
Corner mentality, can't get it out of me
Gotta be mint, I am convinced, concrete cement
Go to beam it, you blessed, you test, you die
On the corner you grew up you lie
And meanwhile

[Hook x2]
