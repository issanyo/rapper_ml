[Verse 1: Aros]
I've been drinking, girl that's how I cope with losing you
Puff a little piff on downtown too
That's how I keep my cool, stressing over you
Yo I lost the best thing ever
Now I picture you in someone new
That's fucking with my pride and my sleep too
Damn I want us back, how can we get back?
This past week felt like forever

[Hook: Aros]
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you
All I wanted, all I needed
All I wanted was you

[Verse 2: Aros]
I been thinking, lately it seems like that's all I do
Especially when I'm out with my crew
You know how they do, how they act a fool
I'm chilling, just reminiscing
They say I'm not acting like myself
This break-up is not good for my health
Girl I'm so lovesick like Ne-Yo and shit
Damn it's been the worst week ever

[Hook: Aros]
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you
All I wanted, all I needed
All I wanted was you

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
She love 'em but she leave 'em
He need her but he a cheater
Can't change the spots on no cheetah
Can't fake the rocks for no divas
No fevers, just 6s
Gold bottles, bar mitzvahs
She like mingling and drug dealer mixes
The ring leader of them drug dealer bitches
Wishes come true, ink shit come through
This is sun zoo, woo
All's fair in love and war
You sure you wanna pick that door then walk through it?

[Hook: Aros]
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you
All I wanted, all I needed
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you
All I wanted, all I needed
All I wanted was you
