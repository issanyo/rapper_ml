[Verse 1: Alley Boy]
Yeah your favorite rapper’s a damn lie
Sneaks lyin nigga boy I testify
I done seen you niggas kind before
It ain’t no way we could be friends, blood shed provoked
It ain’t gonna be a pretty picture I swear to God my nigga

Blood thirsty is the pack like a laughing hyena
You nigga free bitch I can smell the bitch and the..
Here’s the bullet boys nigga digging diamonds and d
I'm at the doorstep nigga didn’t think I come
I’ll have a bottle with friends who betray the Judas
I got a real trap hell runs starters and shooters
These niggas lying through their teeth lining up on me
So we gonna ride in the street, treyvon martin fuck peace
Religion war, crack epidemic

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Your favorite rapper’s a damn lie
You can double check this record that I stand by
How real is he if he been paying for his blood ties?
He blood in, he blood out at a blood drive
Red cross, blue shield, blue steel nigga
Gunfight if you ain't' dead be still nigga
And who is you to ever question who’s a real nigga
You never been, you never was, you never will nigga
Ha,Bought mama's Jag in '01
The only hits I had then was a nose run
Dropped "Grindin'", let you hear just how the dope's slung
Then Shot the video where I was buying my dope from
If that ain't' autobiographical the indictment mentions clothes lines and rappers too
Tell me what the fuck I got to prove
To a mother fucker with nothing to lose?
Never, Never been shit ever

[Verse 3: Alley Boy]
(oooooooh shit)
Desperado guns nigga I got tools for dues
Fuck your labels deals bitch we want ten mill for school
Your nigga pussy in the streets Hollywood they start
Your favorite rapper is a gimic nigga see who you are
But if they say I'm a hater got the idustry fooled
No niggas use to fuck with em say he used to be cool
I draw the line in the sand for them to make their move
I'm just let it get its best knights got real tools
But I ain't hypnotized you see the greed in my eyes
I’m from the streets where easy money be the reason you die
But I got real trust issues I don’t fuck with these niggas
I keep these pussies all around me you ain't gonna sneak me nigga
As the swisher burn slow, blood money count slow
Label duct taped industry niggas remain...
80 bands on my wrist bitch please rappers hide it from jewlers
