[Hook: Karen Harding]
This is a throwdown, know where to go now
You got me so undone
I'm coming for the bullseye, let's see who's gunshy
Oh, what you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for?
Oh, what you're waiting for?

[Pre-Verse: Pusha T]
Imanos, King Push
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fuck is you waiting on, hesitating on
You taking long, you out on a limb
My patience is thin as the ice that you skating on
Figure 8 flow
She move slow like the Ma$e flow
Pick it up on me, then drop low when the bass go
If I say so I money race, I don't chase hoes
But they chase me, hoes better call Maaco
I'm so racial for these pesos
I sold all white to get all green
And this white gold on my black skin
Is like a gold medal, I'm the dream team

[Hook: Karen Harding]
This is a throwdown, know where to go now
You got me so undone
I'm coming for the bullseye, let's see who's gunshy
Oh, what you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for?
Oh, what you're waiting for?

[Bridge: Pusha T]
You said it's showtime, I said it's go time
You said it's showtime, I said it's go time
You said it's showtime, I said it's go time
It's go time
Let's go, let's go

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I don't do the waiting, I ain't got the patience
Let them do the hating, I just want relations
Touching and we tasting, I ain't into chasing
I just go replace 'em, ain't no more debating
Let's get the point, let's get the point
If you know what you want
If you talk about me and you like what you see
Go get what you want
You say it's showtime, I said it's go time
Let's move like it's no time
No need for a cosign, just move like it's go time
It's go time

[Hook: Karen Harding]
This is a throwdown, know where to go now
You got me so undone
I'm coming for the bullseye, let's see who's gunshy
Oh, what you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for?
Oh, what you're waiting for?
