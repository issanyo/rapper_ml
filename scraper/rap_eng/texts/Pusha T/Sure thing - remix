Know you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover

You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that [x4]

If you be the cash
I'll be the rubberband
You be the match
Imma be your fuse
Boom!
Painter baby you
Could be the muse
I'm the reporter baby
You could be the news
Cause your the cigarette
And I'm the smoker
We raise a bet...
Cause your the joker
Truth tho...
You are the chalk
And I could be the blackboard
And you can be the talk
And I could be the walk
Yeaaah

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
Cuz this love is a sure thing

You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that [x4]

You could be the lover
I'll be the fighter babe
If I'm the blunt
You could be the lighter babe
Fire it up!
Writer babe
You could be the quote
If I'm the lyric baby
You could be the note
Record that!
Saint, I'm a sinner

Prize, I'm a winner
And it's you
What can I do to deserve that
Paper baby
I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one
Cause you are ten
Real and not pretend!

Even when the sky comes fallin
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty lil hand in mine
Even when were down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it babe simple and plain
Cause this love is a sure thing

[Pusha T]
She my sure thing, my second only pure thing
It's like heaven when I'm untying them bra strings
See I'm drawn to her, horse and carriage like
Day dreaming got me thinking what is marriage like
She like Terrance Wright, I'm booking Paris Flights
The Hermes H bangles that I heard you like
Say the words and it's there
You put up with the rumours and they blog what you wear
His and her everything, charge for the pair
Couldn't let you cluster when I'm all solitaire's
Share and share alike, I never fear the price
Top of my game, I hope you ain't scared of heights
Roll a dice, you can bet that, never gotta sweat that
Pony hair, Louboutins let you pet that
Ferrari engine like the trunk got a jet pack
Looking pretty on my arms what you best at
PUSH!
