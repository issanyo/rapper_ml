[Intro: Pusha T]
Till the casket drops in '09
Play Cloths in stores
Happy holidays

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
It's the reincarnation of Raekwon in an apron
Lou' Vuitton printed and coke scented
Winding through the flow cuz it's so vintage
Nothing like these timid gimmick, prepaid rappers with no minutes
The real niggas live it; they mimic, they H-O-V lane it and don't pin it
The difference, the Blue Magic ain't in it
We should form a senate to govern critic opinion
I watched them niggas throw away the pennant
To he who claims to be the heir, how dare Pusha nay-say it
Them niggas hear me and they mayday it
So I could care less if Jay say it, it's too political when Jay say it!
He play the game, just instant replay it
The best duo ever
I hangman these words together, pouring passion into every letter
This my letter to the better, I Masta Ace
You niggas standing in a master's place
Fuck out my way

Fuck out my way niggas
Clipse!
Till the casket drops
'09 man
Uh

[Hook: Pusha T]
Stop searching for the e's cuz the o's is long
Now go and put ya Play Cloths on
Stop searching for the e's cuz the o's is long
Now go and put ya Play Cloths on
Stop searching for the e's cuz the o's is long
I spell it how the fucks I want
Stop searching for the e's cuz the o's is long
Now go and put ya Play Cloths on

[Verse 2: Malice]
For all the mothers crying at the sentencing
Finger to the judge, echoing our sentiments
It's in the blood, we play the street diligent
Prepare for the flood, as written in Genesis
With more birds than Noah
No escape, trapped in the whale like Jonah
The SL showing I'm grown up
Passenger side, a bitch prettier than Sho'nuff
No bluff, I cuff that nine milli
I show 'em I'm a soldier, boy - I get silly
My pigeon flown the coop, I free Willy!
My cup too full, I know niggas'll kill me
But I don't bow, even though the crown's heavy
Table cracks, they saying they found Wezzy
Label me the rock king like Presley
But I prefer that hard rock especially (yuugh!)

[Outro: Pusha T]
Haha
Play Cloths in stores man
Happy holidays
You addicted to the fly, go get that shit
Shout out to my nigga Papi
Down there in Miami
I hear you rockin' that shit
Fly nigga shit, yeah
[?]
My brother, I love you nigga
Fam-lay, uh huh
