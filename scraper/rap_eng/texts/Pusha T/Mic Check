[Verse One: Ab-Liva]
Welcome to the Black Card Era, much clearer
Obvious like﻿ the man in the mirror
The bars been raised, the laws are laid, the guns are drawn
With ten paces on the pivot, nigga, one shall fall
And one shall crawl to the top while screaming like King Kong
Among the chosen, the few, the list is not long
I sketch my life, my music, my wrist is not far
From Rembrandt to Van Gogh to Michelangelo
I came, I saw, I conquered, the bliss is not far;
Remove the top is all, follow mist on that car
The wingspan is touched down, the doors are ajar
The King's Hand is blushed now, scoring from afar
Was torn, I weather the storm,﻿ I said, "I'm on"
Then re-evaluated, we thought, we merged reborn
My swag, my form, my crown hat is worn
The black o' dawn, the crack is warm, and the track is formed, it's Liva

[Verse Two: Pusha T]
Pharmaceuticals brought me charm like the jewellers' jewels
Squares of ice shed light like the Rubix cube
I get it mixed up, red with the blues
Now she all mixed up, admiring the hues
Four years later, niggas admiring the shoes
BAPE, you're late, we call﻿ you Tokyo buffoons
The stylist admire us, look at how ya groove
Keep running to SoHo, them exclusives in my room
Niggas is biters, we let you slide with your writings
We knew that cocaine talk was not like you
But who goes as far as trying﻿ to dress like him?
One sequined glove could never make you Michael!
I moonwalk over tracks and make niggas spiteful
But never hear a word 'cause them niggas know
That my flow so viper and if Pusha go psycho
He'll séance that pen and pull your spirit up out ya, P

[Verse Three: Malice]
I'm so literary witj it, you can tell how I write
The boy's such an author, I should smoke a pipe
Rockin' the ascot, the coupe with the glass top
17 inch rims, making the ass drop
I was in the spot from the First to the Fifth
With a mean comeback like the Return of the Sith!
Like riding a bike, never you forget
Still I Got﻿ It 4 Cheap whether you smoke or you sniff
The gift or the curse and vice versa?
To remove me off that Horse takes more than a merger
During that hiatus, I was with the natives
Then﻿ back to the States, pass along the savings
Put it in the street, catering to cravings
Like the Second Coming, got the fans awaiting
Victory is sweet, even amongst the hating
Find me on that beach, island on the Caymans

[Verse Four: Sandman]
Dear Lord, please take the wackness out of rapping
Give them something to practice, don’t let them see action
Amen, say Him, say that nigga is such fire
Firing forward in force, the source is higher
God in my mind, got in my mind
Invisible pen, distribute the phlegm, to get it to Zen
And: we killing com-pe-ti-tion
And: I buy the pocket with him, I blakka blakka with Jin!
Friend? I have none, just family, you see us
Cannons, they seize up, them Re-Up
Gang members, them same niggas
That watch you play Musafa, make you King Simba
Fire in the hole, you cold, your flame simmers
Out, can you stand to rain niggas? We’ll see
Until then, my hat red, my P white
Sitting on a big Benz dash under the streetlight
