(Pusha T) (Intro)
Pixie Lott, Pusha T
Let's go, what's it gonna be
Uh, the drop-top specialist
Yes, we turn heads like an exorcist
Red bottoms on our feet looking devilish
We take it to the next level, feel effortless

(Pixie Lott)
I'm tired of you kicking the dirt
Just want the dust to settle
I'll find just what I deserve
If you can't do better
Can't say that you'll take your time
Before the sweet turns sour
You changed right before my eyes
You picked the wrong flower

[Chorus]
Don 't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Then I'm like whatever
Go on right through the front door
Bye, I'll see you later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for

Boy now that the tables have turned
Now let me see you begging
It's a hard life lesson to learn
When it's me you're not getting
So low but you're all alone
And now you got no power
Let go 'cos I'm cutting the rope
But guess you climbed the wrong tower

[Chorus]
Don 't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Then I'm like whatever
Go on right through the front door
Bye. I'll see you later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for

(Pusha T)
Two kids in a bucket, **** it
The way you handle this
Yeah I'm disgusting
Never been busted, treat me like a suspect
Why am I the one that just can't be trusted
Try harder, discuss it, why bother
I made you, I'll make another and she'll go further
And you can bet a million on it
South of France on a yacht with us chillin on it

[Chorus]
Don 't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Then I'm like whatever
Go on right through the front door
Bye, I'll see you later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
