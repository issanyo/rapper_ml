[Intro: Pusha T]
King Push, Rozzi

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Maybe I'm psycho, maybe you're right though
They said that 'bout Warhol, they said it 'bout Michael
Or maybe you're all wrong, maybe you're spiteful
I'm just a better me, it's like I'm recycled
If they never loved themselves, how could they like you?
I see how they judgin' you, don't let 'em indite you
They constantly killin' you, don't even give life to
Jesus had haters, and most were disciples

[Chorus: Rozzi Crane]
Maybe I'm psycho, maybe I'm a little out of touch
Maybe I'm delusional, or a shot glass away from insane
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm disconnected from all of reality
But that's fine with me, cause I'm happy here

[Verse 2: Rozzi Crane]
It's my life, it's my voice, it's my mind, I can do
What I want, all I want, I don't have to ask you
What to do, what to say, I'm so free, I'm so brave
So tonight, be like me, just lift your hands and say "yeah"!

[Pre-Chorus: Rozzi Crane]
Tonight I'm gonna be as free as birds are
Fly away no matter where or how far
Tonight I'm gonna switch up the way things are
Tear down these walls and break away

[Chorus: Rozzi Crane]
Maybe I'm psycho, maybe I'm a little out of touch
Maybe I'm delusional, or a shot glass away from insane
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm disconnected from all of reality
But that's fine with me, cause I'm happy here

[Verse 3: Rozzi Crane]
I'll do time for my crime if I'm wrong, but I'm right
No need to speak for me, I fight my own fight
I came here by myself and I'm leaving out the same way
Only I can save me, so I'ma take my chances

[Pre-Chorus: Rozzi Crane]
Tonight I'm gonna be as free as birds are
Fly away no matter where or how far
Tonight I'm gonna switch up the way things are
Tear down these walls and break away

[Chorus: Rozzi Crane]
Maybe I'm psycho, maybe I'm a little out of touch
Maybe I'm delusional, or a shot glass away from insane
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm disconnected from all of reality
But that's fine with me, cause I'm happy here

[Bridge: Rozzi Crane]
Try it out, try it out, try it out, hey
Try it out, try it out, try it out, hey
Try it out, try it out, try it out, hey
Try it out, try it out (x2)
You should try it out
You, you, you should, you should
Maybe...

[Chorus: Rozzi Crane]
Maybe I'm psycho, maybe I'm a little out of touch
Maybe I'm delusional, or a shot glass away from insane
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm disconnected from all of reality
But that's fine with me, cause I'm happy here

[Outro over Bridge: Rozzi Crane]
I'm happy here, I'm feeling good here
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
I'm happy here
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
I'm happy here
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
So happy here
