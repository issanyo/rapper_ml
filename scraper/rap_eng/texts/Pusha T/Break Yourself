[Intro: Pusha T]
King Push

[Chorus: Far East Movement & (Pusha T)]
All these freaks around, make a player never wanna leave
All this weed around, I'm only smokin' on the finest tree
So break yourself
(Break yourself, you gotta break yourself)
You better break yourself
(You gotta break yourself, you gotta break yourself)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Hit the button, press like
I just wanna know your type
I just wanna know you might
I'm just caught up in the life
You just caught up in the lights
Lights, camera, action
I just wanna see your reaction
I don't care about your fashion
I just want satisfaction
This ain't no misdemeanor
Move like she cocaina
She's a drug dealer's diva
Knows too much, I can't leave her
So we lay up on beaches
Sipping silver tequilas
Far away, they can't reach us
Cameras can't TMZ us

[Pre-Chorus 1: Pusha T]
Let's just get high
We gon' get by
Break yourself
Pace yourself
We gon' get fly
Let's just get high
We gon' get by

[Chorus: Far East Movement]
All these freaks around, make a player never wanna leave
All this weed around, I'm only smokin' on the finest tree
So break yourself, you better break yourself

All these freaks around, make a player never wanna leave
All this weed around, I'm only smokin' on the finest tree
So break yourself, you better break yourself

[Verse 2: Far East Movement]
What, what, what it do all my macs and hoes
Hit the jack and roll, we get it crackin' though, thorough
How's the dank? Swear I smoke the finest
So tantalizing to my cheeky eyelids
That match my right, drop low like the bass
Gotta love my view, upskirt, match the face
I could kill that coo' two thousand and one ways
Give her kush and dick 'til she forgot about Dre
So when we gonna fuck? Murder was the case
Left you ice creaming on the rug, let me get a taste
Young, and we ain't never done, pass it to my homie Nate
East Side throw it up, Movement never player hate
Chrome wheel stay spinnin', hoe grinnin'
I'm winnin', oh, we do it right
Tonight I'm sinnin', no trippin'
Just dippin', oh, what a life

[Pre-Chorus 2: Far East Movement]
Where the bricks at? At the motel
Where the G's hit you up like a jail cell
Put your hands up, to the top shelf
All my bitches better break yourself
Better break yourself

[Chorus: Far East Movement]
All these freaks around, make a player never wanna leave
All this weed around, I'm only smokin' on the finest tree
So break yourself, you better break yourself

All these freaks around, make a player never wanna leave
All this weed around, I'm only smokin' on the finest tree
So break yourself, you better break yourself
