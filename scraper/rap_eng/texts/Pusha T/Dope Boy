Love fake asses, I like my bitches ratchet (yeah)
Jeweler in Miami, shout out my nigga Tito
Make a couple million dollas with my nigga P, tho (what up nigga)
Think you turn’t up, boy, I bring your ass to zero
Thought I woulda shit when I bought my first kilo (come on)
Lunch on Peach Street, I think I got a taste for brio
You can make some money if you loss the fuckin’ ego (stupid ass nigga)
Tryin’ to catch the R.I.C.O., that’s an automatic 30
Hundred pound plate, that’s an automatic 30

I ain’t the same ol’ dope boy
I give the same ol’ dope boys hope, boy
You ain’t got to take a note, boy
You can buy it off the lot and go float, boy
S63s on a slope, boy
Steppin’ out in all white, I’m the Pope, boy
Bishop Don Juan of this blow, boy
It's a fine line, stay woke, boy
I was sellin’ coke, boy
Back when Cam’ron was yellin’ “Oh boy”

You wasn’t making no noise

I’ ain’t give that hoe shit, I made that bitch work (bitch)
Stove broke, the mircowave make that brick work (come on)

Last time it was short but this time it was over
Stretch the dope out, got that bitch doin' yoga
A fool with the kush, I started out with a pound (yeah)
