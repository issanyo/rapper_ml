[Intro: Mr. Lee]
Ayyy, papá
Re-Up Gang Records
That hold-the-door music
You know, Broadway, daddy
Monteca, crack, hooray
(*speaking Spanish*)
Uptown baby, otra vez
Clipse, Hell Hath No Fury, b
Let em know, daddy, Mr. Lee!

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fear him, as soon as you hear him
Upon my arrival, the dope dealers cheer him
Just like a revival, the verse tends to steer 'em
Through a life in the fast lane, I German engineer 'em
No serum can cure all the pain I've endured
From crack to rap to back to selling it pure
For every record I potentially sell in the store
It's like Mecca to the dealer that's selling it raw
So many deceive ya
I'm more in touch with the keys, move over Alicia
I force feed ya the metric scale
Rap's like child's play, my show and tell
Within each verse you see the truth's unveiled
They manufacture proof as they lie to themselves
Puppets on the string like a yo-yo
Bouncing like a pogo, they praying I never go solo

[Hook]
We got it for cheap

[Interlude: Mr. Lee]
Do it! I fuck wit the real niggas, daddy
Fuck these bitch-ass niggas
(*speaking Spanish*)
They just wanna be you, loco!
Fucking ambicioso
(*more Spanish*)

[Verse 2- Malice]
The wool's removed and now I see
My leg was pulled, the joke's on me
So heartbreakin, like lovin a whore
Might hurt ya once, but never no more
It's like tryin to fly but they clippin your wings
And that's exactly why the caged bird sings
Who can nickname it? The shame rings true
Seems to me reparations are overdue
I done been to the top, I done sipped the juice
And with that being said, bird crumbs'll never do
Even on my last, not a penny in the bank
I'ma stand on my own, so thanks, but no thanks
Keep the pranks as I bid farewell
I gotta answer to Marcus and Jennelle
And to little brother Terrence who I love dearly so
If ever I had millions, never would you push blow, never

[Hook]

[Interlude: Mr. Lee]
Ay, dios mío! Malicioso!
The handcuffs are off now Daddy
Entiende! Cabroncito
Everyone must pay now!
(*more Spanish*)
Re-Up Gang Records
It's your game now, daddy

[Verse 3:  Pusha T]
I'm the best since he died, and he lied
The spirit of competition, one verse could start jihad
CPR Pusha, the flow tends to revive
Pullin the covers back, I expose what you disguise
My presence is felt, the pressure is on
A 4'11" Cuban helped us weather the storm
Pyrex and powder, it was back to the norm
Through all the adversity, the fury was born

[Verse 4: Malice]
Niggas don't get the picture, it's written in scripture
Even ask your mama, she'll tell you that blood's thicker
And I don't know how them other niggas built
And I don't know if ever they feel guilt
Or maybe niggas just too high on they stilts
But this one's on me, I'ma view it as spilt milk
Grandma, look at me, I'm turnin the other cheek
It's the R-E-U-P G-A-N-G

[Hook]

[Outro: Mr. Lee]
From the street to this música
We get this money, we never stop
Record sales? Digital scales? It's whatever
We always at home
Hell Hath No Fury
(*speaking Spanish*)
Mr. Lee!
