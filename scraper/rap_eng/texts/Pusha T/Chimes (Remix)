[Intro: Future]
Her heart is so cold
Her heart is so cold, her heart is so cold
She in love with the pole
She grind for the rolls, and she tweakin' her nose
Her heart is so cold
Her heart is so cold, she in love with the pole
She want your friend and your foe
She want the life with you, no, she gotta heighten the O

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
She took your car to go and see that nigga
She in his ear like "I'ma leave that nigga"
You ain't really see it comin', did ya?
She took your heart and tried to feed it to ya
Twitter told you she was out of town
She ain't notice she was out of bounds
You 'bout to bust out all her windows, ain't ya?
And catch a charge that ain't 'bout no paper

[Chorus: Future]
Her heart is so cold
Her heart is so cold, she in love with the pole
The money, the car, the cars and the clothes
The life with you, no, she gotta heighten the O

[Verse 2: French Montana]
My dealer want 911 Porsche a nigga
All this money, might Scott Storch a nigga
Preacher Crew, might start extortin' nigga
Know who run the town like I'm from Boston, nigga
Mixin' purple with that Henny, man it get you startled
When you talkin' 'bout that money, man they'll eat your heart out
All my niggas rollin', sippin' on that molly water
Shorty on that hazy, shout to Richard Porter

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Her heart is so cold
Her heart is so cold, her heart is so cold
She in love with the pole
She grind for the rolls, and she tweakin' her nose

[Chorus: Future]
Her heart is so cold
Her heart is so cold, she in love with the pole
The money, the car, the cars and the clothes
The life with you, no, she gotta heighten the O

[Bridge: Travi$ Scott]
She in love with the party
She in love with the molly
She in love, that's so crazy
She in love
For real though, do you feel love?
I get trill love, not real love
I'm tryna figure, should I tip her?
I'm an H-Town nigga (Straight up!)

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
You ain't been around a richer nigga
He can only show you bitches' pictures
It's like the chopper shot the nigga down
But he don't even see that she the trigger
Ain't nothin' wrong with your ambition, baby
Come fuck this platinum musician, baby
Your nigga pockets screamin' "Out of order"
Fuck Net-a-Porter, we can cross the border

[Chorus: Future]
Her heart is so cold
Her heart is so cold, she in love with the pole
The money, the car, the cars and the clothes
The life with you, no, she gotta heighten the O
