[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Hand in my pocket and my fingers on the trigger
Walk Fulton mall like a Fulton street nigga
Still by my fronts off of Fulton street, nigga
Gabby got my face next to Shyne in the pictures
Sean C mad cause my time a little off
But I tried to tell 'em I make mines off of soft
So while he screaming deadlines I just ducked fed time
Read about it as this Lamborghini redlines
I'm CK with my Cody way
Mistaken for BK when the flow's displayed
When really I'm BX with that reflex
Replaced in VA, I'm a reject
Perfection takes time like a vintage wine
Don't compare me to fake rappers, they just fucking rhyme
So when you want a Johnny on the spot
The only thing I got is my Glock

[Hook: A$AP.Ferg]
We got our hand in our pocket with our finger on the trigger
Little man with a couple rockets, you ain't fucking with us
Cause your man on the blocka blocka, brain up on that ceiling
I be damned if you gossip, gossip, run up on your children
And they don't and they don't and they don't and they don't
(This is what it is)
And they don't and they don't and they don't and they don't
(This is what it is)
And they don't and they don't and they don't and they don't
(We gon' run up on your kids)
And they don't and they don't and they don't and they don't
(And it is what it is)
And they don't

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
The best things come to those who wait, the yola bakes
The condo is paid off by the closing date
No verse paid for that, that's from throwing weight
To every nigga getting money hope to motivate
And all similar guns, Rozay runs
For 16 hours we would sweep up crumbs
Still then we would never sleep on niggas
Kept our hands in our pockets and our fingers on the trigger

[Hook]

[Verse 3: A$AP.Ferg]
You talking about what you gon' do, sir, talking about busting your Ruger
I don't believe you got looser, most of you pussies is neutered
Talking about how you got big guns, you just be fuck computers
Talking about how your man draws, this nigga remind me of Luther
I'm just a little bipolar and my system is hunting on solar
And I'm spitting like [?] welcome to an island of vultures
And I'm so superfragilisticexpi-out-of-my-dosage
And I need my medicine cause I'm sick as fucking neurosis
In the focus, lines of coke in noses [?]
Fucking bitches [?]
Oh shit, tell your bitch to blow this
I'm a motherfucking lunatic, run around with hooligans
This motherfucker don't want beef, I heard he on some tuna shit
Hit him over the head with a motherfucking pool stick
Hold this fucker a hostage, hmm, feed this bitch a spoon of shit
You like that?
I'mma take this garbage out and I'll be right back
