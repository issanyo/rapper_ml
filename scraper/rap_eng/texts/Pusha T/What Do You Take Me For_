[Intro: Pusha T]
Let's go
Uh, the drop-top specialist
Yes, we turn heads like an exorcist
These red bottoms on our feet looking devilish
We take it to the next level, so effortless

[Verse 1: Pixie Lott]
I'm tired of you kicking the dirt, just want the dust to settle
I'll find just what I deserve, if you can't do better
Can't say that you took your time before the sweet turned sour
You changed right before my eyes, you picked the wrong flower

[Hook: Pixie Lott]
Don't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Then I'm like whatever
Go on right through the front door
Bye, I'll see ya later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for?
What do you take me for?

[Verse 2: Pixie Lott]
Boy, now that the tables have turned, don't let me see you begging
It's a hard life lesson to learn, when it's me you're not getting
So low but you're all alone, and now you got no power
Let go cause I'm cutting the rope, I guess you climbed the wrong tower

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it
The way you handle this, yuugh, I'm disgusting
Never been busted, treat me like a suspect
Why am I the one that just can't be trusted?
Try harder, discuss it, why bother?
I made you, I'll make another and she'll go farther
Woo! And you can bet a million on it
South of France on a yacht with us chillin' on it

[Hook]
