[Verse]
They think that they know, somethin' 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number, I just took her home with
Another bitch, menage, boomerang, estrange
Lipstick on my collar, oscar de le renta
You hijo pequeno, my nachos bel grande
Stay sippin that Andre, spend three stacks that's Andre
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim, they say I'm dressin' like Kanye
I'm everything my rhymes say, bread winner, brand owner, play clothes, millionaire, trend setter, land owner
Hope your bitch don't land on him, drink in his hand with the sand on em
You small niggas, you Hyundais,
Y'all couch niggas we stand on em
Big mu uh uh dope money with a band on it
Half gold, but got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same, just got a little bit of glam on it
DAM!
