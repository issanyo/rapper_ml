[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Overdose on a sunset and an open coast
My network full of drug dealers who don't hold a note
We'll hold a gun, if it's on the line we might hold the pope
Forgive me Lord, I ain't hold your hand, I was holdin' dope
See my future in the rear view, new Benz it got the clear view
New tint, I'm Black Rob, I dare you, woo
King Push, take a look at me now
What they took for granted
I took and ran it, are you feelin' me now?
