[Intro: Pusha T]
God judge, God knows
What's in his heart until his eyes closed
God judge, God knows
What's in his heart until his eyes closed

[Verse 1: River Tiber]
People's opinions
I never listen
Burning ambitions
Earned my addictions
I forget without forgiving
God as my witness
My mind has been missing
I needed distance

[Pre-Chorus: River Tiber]
I don't say a word when I let you know
And I can see clear with my eyes closed
I jump without looking
I jump without looking

[Chorus: River Tiber]
But the high is so confusing
High is so confusing
When you get caught in these illusions
Caught in these illusions
And the high is so confusing
High is so confusing
When you get caught in these illusions
Caught in these illusions

[Bridge: Pusha T]
God judge, God knows
What's in his heart until his eyes closed
God judge, God knows
What's in his heart until his eyes closed

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Only God judge, God knows
What's in his heart until his eyes closed
I've been searchin' for a Pablo
Since denim jackets with rhinestones
Jeep Wranglers, New Jacks
Spanish niggas is the new blacks
Never thought I'd see the tides turn
Old gangstas are the new rats
New body, new wheels
Money counters for the new bills
I perfected my money dance
I'm like Johnny Dang with a new grill
Smile, bitch, when you see me comin'
Like Player's Club, how them hoes be runnin'
Greenlight 'em, I reunite 'em
With a leaf pile of every fallen hundred
Only God judge, God knows
What's in his heart until his eyes closed
I've been cookin' up them pies, yo
I Billy Blanks 'em like Tae Bo (stretch)
I'm part psycho, mixed with Michael
Got the chain on, that's the light show
80 thousand on the left wrist, that's the right Rolex

[Pre-Chorus: River Tiber]
I don't say a word when I let you know
And I can see clear with my eyes closed
I jump without looking
I jump without looking

[Chorus: River Tiber]
But the high is so confusing
High is so confusing
When you get caught in these illusions
Caught in these illusions
And the high is so confusing
High is so confusing
When you get caught in these illusions
Caught in these illusions

[Outro: Pusha T]
King Push, yeah
River Tiber on the track
Kaytranada
I'm the last cocalero
