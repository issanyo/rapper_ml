[Intro: Desiigner]
Ayy
Tell
Ayy, got one?
Ayy, tell
On a spell
Purple jet
Purple jet

[Hook: Desiigner]
I'ma run right through this paper
I'ma run right through this paper
Right through a check
Cop me a jet
Go cop me a jet
Go cop me a jet
I'ma run right through this paper
I'ma go right through this paper
Right through a check
Cop me a jet
Young nigga cop him a TEC
Cop me a jet

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I spent two milla on where I rest
I got two hundred up on my neck
Dual exhausts like Twin Towers
On that Carerra I cause a jet
Please call 9-1-1
You know this a Turbo S
Still got the scale, nigga
Feel like I'm Virgo-esque
I might fuck up a check on her
If we kick it, David Beck on her
That's my Becky with the good hair
Say King Push done went left on 'em
All designers, not a problem
Ask Desiigner, I signed him (true)
Billboard's a jungle gym
Sat back and watch 'em climb 'em
It's Nobu on his charter
Crab roll starters (no chopsticks)
Main course was from
Malaysian open waters
Apollo jets, you just jet smarter
Love the money
And I'm married to the game, meet me at the altar

[Hook: Desiigner]
I'ma run right through this paper
I'ma run right through this paper
Right through a check
Cop me a jet
Go cop me a jet
Go cop me a jet
I'ma run right through this paper
I'ma go right through this paper
Right through a check
Cop me a jet
Young nigga cop him a TEC
Cop me a jet

[Verse 2: Desiigner]
I'ma run right through this paper
I'ma run right through this paper
Right through a check (check, check)
I'ma go cop me a TEC (TEC, TEC)
Milly gon' cop him a TEC (TEC, TEC)
For them new shoes, die for respect
I'ma run right through this paper
I'ma run right through this paper
Ballin' hard like the Lakers
Givin' bitch nigga no favors
You gettin' hit with the razors
He gettin' hit with the shaver
Ballin' hard like the Pacers
Niggas talkin' like they raised us
None of 'em raised us
I'ma get right to this paper
I'ma get right through this paper
Run through a check
I'ma go die for respect
Bitch nigga hit like the ref
For them new shoes, die for respect

[Hook: Desiigner]
I'ma run right through this paper
I'ma run right through this paper
Right through a check
Cop me a jet
Go cop me a jet
Go cop me a jet
I'ma run right through this paper
I'ma go right through this paper
Right through a check
Cop me a jet
Young nigga cop him a TEC
Cop me a jet
