[Verse 1: Malice]
I'm lovin' it is this the place to eat?
Since I don't cook I'll just rock to the beat
I'm lovin' it at the end of the day
To relieve the stress we add a little play
I'm lovin' it sometimes we have mishaps
You Just overcoming adaptive setbacks
I'm lovin' it you know you're my world
How can I mind love taps from my girl?

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
McDonald's
Ba da ba ba ba
I'm lovin' it

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Move your feet, rock to the beat
Hungry for the music gotta eat, I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it no guts no glory
Seems like I stumbled in the wrong territory
I'm lovin' it looks can be deceiving
There's a slight change of plans for the evening
I'm lovin' it my cars way too clean
If only I could start this fine piece of machine
I'm lovin' it

[Hook]
