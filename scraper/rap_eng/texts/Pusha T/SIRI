[Intro: Elliphant & Pusha T]
ET finger up in the air
King Push
ET finger up in the air
Yogi
ET finger up in the air
God damn, god damn, fuck 12, my bitches

[Pre-Hook: Elliphant]
Y'all bitches can't see me, y'all bitches can't see me
My pockets is full of the bullets that missed me
They question in CC
Your life is a movie so flick off your TV
Now roll up a 3D
Don’t want it, don’t want it
These bitches can't see me, I answer like Siri
(Turn that fucking shit inside out)

[Hook: Elliphant]
ET finger up in the air
ET finger up in the air
ET finger up in the air
ET finger up in the air
God damn, god damn, fuck 12, my bitches

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Siri, I got a question
I need direction
You got a best friend?
Get to sexting
I got the top floor
At the Westin
And a two-door
Like The Jetsons
It’s best when they both know when they stressing
They bend over, they flexing, they go harder than wrestling
She Columbian and she Mexican
She got the plug and she can send it in

[Pre-Hook: Elliphant]
Y'all bitches can't see me, y'all bitches can't see me
My pockets is full of the bullets that missed me
They question in CC
Your life is a movie so flick off your TV
Now roll up a 3D
Don’t want it, don’t want it
These bitches can't see me, I answer like Siri
(Turn that fucking shit inside out)

[Hook: Elliphant]
ET finger up in the air
ET finger up in the air
ET finger up in the air
ET finger up in the air
God damn, god damn, fuck 12, my bitches

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I could tell you what the Porsche cost
What my wrist's like
What a brick weigh
What your bitch like
Ace bottles and late models
Niggas happy with the bass models
Fashion god from Bape model
They follow
I'm the culture
KRS in a 'Rosta
I'm poetry
Scott La Rock with the coca
I'm a soldier
I sell vultures
That's no less
Than three birds and I'm coasting

[Pre-Hook: Elliphant]
Y'all bitches can't see me, y'all bitches can't see me
My pockets is full of the bullets that missed me
They question in CC
Your life is a movie so flick off your TV
Now roll up a 3D
Don’t want it, don’t want it
These bitches can't see me, I answer like Siri
