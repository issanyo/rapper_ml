Its like an itch you can't scratch
Its like a bitch you can't shake
I still wanna
Sleeping with the finest
The thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate Im Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwin on the sherwin, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got em feeling like hes Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your World spin
Learn from OGs, Alpha Romeos and Sterling
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue, in the insides potato sacks
Yeah, talk money, Im made of that
Cocaine parties, like the 70s I cater that
You know what fame is?
Sittin with the women of your dreams and forgettin what her name is
You know what pain is?
Flushing 2 bricks and have a nigga try to strain it out the drainage

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo
I still wanna sell kilos
Its like Im throwing rocks at the pen begging for the rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fish scale like Im tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
Thats what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos
[Rick Ross]
Grew up watching momma car repoed
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my own star
Piecing puzzles together solving homocides ?
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red Velour, Im in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
Fiddling dope a real nigga sell yayo
Everyday a nigga dies than we can't ask why
Show em all love, the bitches f-cked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce corniche, trunk full of work

[Hook]
See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo
I still wanna sell kilos
Its like Im throwing rocks at the pen begging for the rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fish scale like Im tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
Thats what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos
[Ab Liva]
Testarossa top models, G4s, Gucci pass the crease off
Everything I climb in, I win
Richer male, ?, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head
Powder smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rose bottles pour for the Champions
You think it was a Grammy win
Celebration spills through the morning like an ambion
Bithces love my ambience
Chain swinging, ticker taping like its Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousands keys that Im about to do pilates on
Where the Kings crowned like the grill a Maseratis on
Candy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper
Blew a fuse and caught a body on
Cocaine storaging
Liva living dreams, ya DeLoreans pouring in
