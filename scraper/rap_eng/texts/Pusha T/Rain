Rain tonight
I'm gon' make it rain tonight
I'm gon' make it rain tonight
Rain come down on you
Rain come down on you
I'm gon' make it rain tonight
Rain come down on you
Rain come down on you

[Verse 1: Keke Wyatt]
Boy, this is what you want
I'm gon' make it storm tonight
Precipitation fill the room
You feel that thunder roolin', boom!
(Ka-boom!)

Feel the rumble when our love collide
Skin-to-skin gon' make ya come alive
Scattered showers in our bed tonight
Scattered showers in our bed tonight

[Pre-Hook]
It's comin' down, it's comin' down
Are you ready for it (ready for it)
It's comin' down, it's comin' down
Are you ready for it (ready for it)

Hope you got your coat
I'm about to make it pour
I'm about to make it pour
(Down, down, down)

[Hook: Keke Wyatt]
I'm gon' make it rain tonight
I'm gon' make it rain tonight
I'm gon' make it rain tonight
Rain come down on you
Rain come down on you
I'm gon' make it rain tonight
Rain come down on you
Rain come down on you

[Verse 2: Keke Wyatt]
I hear your body when it talks
Telling me you don't want to slow down
I keep it raining all night long
Whatever you want to do, I'm gon' do it

Ay, ay, ay
I'm gon' do it
Ay, ay, ay
Are you down for it?
Ay, ay, ay
Are you down for it?

[Rap: Pusha T]
You ready?

Money flowin' like water
She just love to get wet
She be runnin' for the border
Cause he ain't makin' her sweat

I'm gon' make her take a ride for it
Catch a cramp her thighs for it
Cash out, get the dealer tags
All you gotta do is sign for it

Woo! See there, I wanna be clear
If the sun is out or the rain is pourin'
I'mma be there

Push! Vacate in a drop-top on Biscayne
Night is young, the bottle's up
You ain't worried about another bitch name

Just which lane we swervin' in to be out
I'm sweatin' her weave out
Until we done and we out

Yugh! Keke and King Push in 3D
That's big bruh and lil' sis
Like Bebe and Cece, owww!
