Marcelo Burlon just released the promotional teaser to his upcoming Spring/Summer 2014 collection. The visuals, for his Marcelo Burlon; Country of Milan brand keeps the core t shirt designs, while venturing out into wind breakers, shorts, tank tops, sweaters, hoodies and a mask. The additional pieces tease us with even more unique animal inspired prints

The video itself is interesting for those of the hip hop community as it features a chopped and screwed version of Pusha T's "Numbers On The Boards". Pusha and Burlon are no strangers, they're so close the pair released a collection together earlier in the year. Look for these and more designs from Burlon later this year at his website
