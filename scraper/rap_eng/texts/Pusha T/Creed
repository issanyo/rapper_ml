[Hook]
Feel good when your money up
Stuffin' your pockets with hundred bucks
I sit back and roll up the trees
I swear that they didn't believe
I'm sprayin' my body with Creed
100 bitches feel the breeze
Got the trappin' in my jeans
Got the money in my jeans

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
I was posted on the curbs
These bitches gettin' on my nerves
My shooters they ready to purge
I did it, I whip it and serve
Crime pay all my luxury
[?] right next to me
I know that you wanna stand next to me
I know that you wantin' the recipe
I was rollin' with extensions
I was just rollin' through the trenches
I was cookin' in the ditches
Made a junkie cookin' dishes
But you know I ain't trippin', yeah you gotta see my vision
Yeah, they talkin' like this you gotta stand in the kitchen
I know you niggas really wishin'
I know you wanna catch me slippin'
I know you wanna see me fall off
But you see me in a new Bentley

[Hook]
Feel good when your money up
Stuffin' your pockets with hundred bucks
I sit back and roll up the trees
I swear that they didn't believe
I'm sprayin' my body with Creed
100 bitches feel the breeze
Got the trappin' in my jeans
Got the money in my jeans

[Bridge]
Got the money in my jeans
Got the money in my jeans
Got the money in my jeans
Got the money in my jeans
I'm sprayin' my body with Creed
Know these bitches feel the breeze
Got the trappin' in my jeans
Got the money in my jeans

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Invitation to The White House
Cops ran in my white house
Blowbama meets Obama
History you can't whiteout
Baltimore pull your bikes out
Mafia like 3-6
I can sell it for the 30 piece
Cut the brick up with the remix
They be talkin' at the precinct
I can tell you 'bout the G6
They can tell you when the drought come
I can tell you when the keys hit
Never did I own a V6
Shit, I started in the V8
You was cool sellin' 8Balls, my phone chirp when they need weight
Call the lord when I need faith
Call your bitch when I need face
Platinum motors on the dealer tag, Ferrari wagon got knee space
Luther Campbell, if you need bass
Bench pressing like I free weight
'Case the FED's wanna retrace, it was all done on my pre-paid
Yea

Feel good when your money up

Got the money in my jeans
