[Intro: Pusha T]
Yeah, in closing (Get familiar!)
Effortless shit, the ultimate flow, y'know

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Life is what you make it, ya flows are makeshift
I draw this of inspiration, you trace shit
Patience been my life story
They say the trials almost over and I can taste the glory
It's hard to ignore me with this big ass chain
Or this bright ass watch, all this big ass bling
One thing about it see it's more than a name
Say to hell with the verses, still the Re-Up Gang
Two zero comma five a key, the peace symbol front of the V
Fuck gold digger bitches my Giuseppe freaks uh
Mama I means no harm, you lack class and charm
But I ain't got it either, accustomed to a certain way of living
Only know two ways of getting
Either rap or un-wrap, if you ain't get it you ain't live it
So if you ain't get it your money tall as midget, P

[Hook X2: Sandman]
You mad huh, I know you like my style
You got to feel us, its the real one unfamiliar
Not to ever let you know ma
The ultimate flow you know dope baby

[Verse 2: Sandman]
Accustomed to the luxuries that cheese bring
I'm a grown man, baby your heart, finding myself teething
The big faces got me fucked up
I admit I'm too weak, stay broke say fuck it and suck it up
So I worked out with some niggas from the strip
Started off slow we was all color nicks
Couple months later I was getting different bricks
Then I added more weight with intent to get bigger
Now I floss on chicks and intimidate niggas
Stack cheddar in the safe like records in the crates
I cut with 2 techs turn tables and fade y'all
Little minded niggas think short and stay small
But team ball like A.I and stay fly, with our eyes on the prize
(even thought we getting money we'll) size up ya squad
Ride on y'all and divide up ya pies then maintain our rides

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Malice]
All the money in the world, and I ain't fulfilled
But what could be missing I mean, the wrist on chill
The neck all frozen I should feel like the chosen
Waterfront home, overlooking the ocean
All these hues, one should be humored and amused
But more often than not I find myself confused
Cruising in that drop, and still I feel
As if I'm nothing more than a hamster in a wheel
Enough with the women they don't see past the chain
I don't see past the ass, two can play the game
Gotta thank god for cane I guess that's the twist
Cause I never sold my rhymes would sound like this....
You know I just be standing here looking funny
Nothing to say, bunch of air and shit....
It's like a double edged sword, a catch 22
You damned if you don't, you damned if you do

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ab-Liva]
Ex-dope dealer the ex being the quotient, dividing the pride
By the motion that I'm moving what's a coast off the ocean
Of port potion of black mans anchor we don't own tankers
But the trick is that we rise gon' sink us
This dope thinker is torn, Iâ€™m at odds with myself
And no matter what I buy I can't pardon myself
Pardon my wealth, my arm wear charm hair contradict myself
But I feel I was honest here, I feel I'm torn as shit
But I'm smooth nigga, check my walk, you love my swagger
Plays my part, the creme-de-la-creme raise my heart
Who fucking with I, touch I, must I, simply clear my throat
The king that can't hush I, plus I
Got these niggas under pressure got they eyes blood shot
Blood hot, they boil, R-E-U-P Gang,  four brothers like we blood tied

[Hook]

[Outro: Pusha T]
Yeah niggas the ultimate flow, you know
Re-up gang, you know, we got it for cheap volume 2
This the black card era
Nobody fucking with sandman nigga
Nobody fucking with liva nigga
Nobody fucking with malice nigga
Nobody fuckin with skateboard p nigga
And you know me, dont even try it, neighborhood Push
