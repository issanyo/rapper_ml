[Verse 1: Pusha T]
It's like watching my whole life flash in front of me
Knowing I am one of the
Best whoever done it, as a writer shuns it
Them niggas young MC, while I Big Pun it
Trying to revisit that impact when Big done it
Or when Pac did it, even when Nas won it
I Daddy Kane over the tracks, them niggas King Sun it
I'm from the era when BET had team summit
Now the watch is like a hell date to turn my stomach
This high level of artistry's a part of me
I'm bored by so called peers, y'all have to pardon me
Graffiti beat street, write my life for all to see
You take a bite and leave the rest I remind you of Lee
Do your history, if you can't reminisce with me
You connect the parallels and recognize what gift it be
It's not a mystery, no more second guessing him
At this point you ain't got to question who I'm better than

[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]
Food on the table, when it's not
I move that lean, keep them fiends up and down the block
It's my routine, seventeen, though the block is hot
I'm coming cool with my tool, knocking of my rocks
Long story short, I done made it through some shit
That has got lots of niggas laid in view
What I say to dudes, wake up from that snooze
Before that nigga dead on the news in the View
I done slept in cribs with grenades, crazy weapons
Pushed cars with more drugs than Rite Aid and EPIC
Across state lines, without my squad
Just to get paid, laid it all on the line
Now I thank God, there ain't nothing else
That kept a nigga free or turn him back into dust
You know how many niggas I done buried
Niggas ask for cheddar too
Wishing they were free on the bricks to make a better move
Pull some four hundred months, some got forever
Trade everything you treasure for some nice weather
Or some good pussy, a kiss from a whore, a trip to the store
Wake up young boy

[Hook: Kanye West & Elton John]
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

[Verse 3: Sandman]
It's complicated this life I live
The cars, the whores are beautiful but I all need is focus
Cut the ladder up, the ladder to success that I climb
I steer steps to the top, I'm complex
I'm a hustler with a turbulent mind
Modern day thinking, statues to interpret the lines
The well thought out, when I was caught out
There when I was tortured
Seems to morph with my inner thoughts, it's torture I bear
Like a mob, when I was robbed of my youth
The dope game pulled a nigga feet first
In the flames with cocaine
What a wonderful bitch I made
Man that nigga can't front I love them acolaydes
The dope money from the out lookin in they see a thug nigga thing
So unconsciously I'm draped in drug dealer bling
Drug dealer street can't get his crown now
We got it 4 cheap volume 3, nigga bow down

[Verse 4: Malice]
Only does it seem that the grass is greener
Never would have dreamed cash come between us
So hysterically I laughed
I thought it was understood I give you my last
I thought it was to the good, baby boy could rap
We long since left the hood, the rest should be a snap
Or so I thought, instead it was a slap to the face
To this day, what am I to make of that
If I could the old days I'd wish them back
When the OJ's played and the crib was still intact
Forever mine, quickly turned to never mine
I pondered to myself, if I had never signed
And in my mind, I was only trying for better
The Big Wheel era should have lasted forever
Who knew we lacked glue to stick together
I find it so hard to keep my head up

[Hook]
