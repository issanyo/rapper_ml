[Verse 1: Leezy Soprano]
Let me put it in perspective, they tell me niggas talking
But my hearing is selective
Lane switch, main bitch appearing in my section
Your album never touched? What you're fearing is rejection
I guess when you're in competition with a boss
You're left in the dust, what you're smelling is exhaust
Self paid wasn't afraid to take a loss
It just gave birth to my ambition I'm taking off
And I show you how to do this son
Name ring bells so the students come
Two feet planted in the newest ones
And the "Y" means young for the clueless ones
It's like niggas wanna claim my turf
I'm still your father, though I missed your birth
My shit go harder I take your CD's
Seeing who can throw farther, let your bitch go first
It's the killer and you ain't on shit
Putting bitches on a plane just to feed them long dick
I never heard your name, never seen a song spit
Be them niggas wanting fame we don't get along with
It's the life boy

[Hook: Leezy Soprano]
There when the champagne pouring (that Möet)
But gone when the check gone, that ain't love
Smiling all up in my face
Talking 'bout me till the next one, that ain't love
That ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love
That ain't love, that ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love Talking about me till the next one, that ain't love
That ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love
That ain't love, that ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love
Talking about me till the next one, that ain't love
That ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love
That ain't love, that ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Spend a day with the money and the power
Me I'm both them, money and the power
Push your tongue key, that's money with the powder
Inspired by them niggas and in Benzs out front Howard
Tell me what you know about it
If the watch don't say it, then the chain shouts it
If seeing is believing, then you'll never doubt it
Its all hip-hop you don't gotta count it
Follow my lead past the velvet rope
Standing on tables, Rosé in a choke
Hot summer nights blowing through a couple grands
VIP section with the world in my hands, let's go

[Hook: Leezy Soprano]
There when the champagne pouring (that Möet)
But gone when the check gone, that ain't love
Smiling all up in my face
Talking 'bout me till the next one, that ain't love
That ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love
That ain't love, that ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love Talking about me till the next one, that ain't love
That ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love
That ain't love, that ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love
Talking about me till the next one, that ain't love
That ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love
That ain't love, that ain't love, that ain't motherfucking love

[Verse 3: Raz Simone]
Sir Mix a lot ain't done shit for me
Ain't no famous rappers out here making shit for the streets
My niggas on the corner with the Crips and  G's
While these friendly ass rappers sucking dick for free
Who the fuck you bitches thinking that you gonna try
Like a record I be playing in on both sides
You say you caught a body nigga don't lie
I don't see a killer when I look in those eyes
Not a lot of people in my city I respect
Everybody's worried about being politically correct
Or which rapper is about to get next
So they can take their surfboard out and ride that wave until it connects
And I ain't really with all of that fuck shit
I'mma minute man nigga, cause I bust quick
I'm in the nights up in the trenches when feds is in my biz
Well I'm gonna confront the camera
Cause they won't quit taking my picture
And I'm ready for the war, cause its go time
Whats a tweet to a gorilla with a four-five
There's a couple weird things that I don't mind
But a fake rapper isn't one of those kinds
You can sense the acts, they want me to hit the brakes
I agree that switching pace is needed to get in place
But a tortoise against a plane isn't gonna win the race
Put the tortoise shell in my shotgun and that hare on my dinner plate
