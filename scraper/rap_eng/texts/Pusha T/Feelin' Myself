I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feeling myself
It's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I gon' ball like I'm seven feet tall
I don't know about you all but I'm a get off
Cause I'm feeling myself

Oh, what a feeling
The champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathing in millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling
Still up on my nino
Smelling like a kilo
But I'm downy fresh soft white like my Pinot
Feeling myself so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights
Middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world
Just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself

I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feeling myself
It's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I gon' ball like I'm seven feet tall
I don't know about you all but I'm a get off
Cause I'm feeling myself

Shop until you drop
They say sharing is caring
More than my winnings
We can share opinions
Like baby steps
We can share beginnings
Walk before you run but she so independent
And I could see us fly
The sky is the limit
We so real
Got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed
Watching Deal Or No Deal
In a perfect world
Just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself

I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feeling myself
It's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I gon' ball like I'm seven feet tall
I don't know about you all but I'm a get off
Cause I'm feeling myself

I propose a toast
To every living kingpin smart enough to delegate their work to their wing
Man, keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling and play my cards right
Now I'm looking at a dream hand
Yes, got you looking at my poker face
No joker see it
You can call me smoking ace
In a perfect world
Just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself

I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feeling myself, it's my world
