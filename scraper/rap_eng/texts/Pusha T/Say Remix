[Verse 1: Erin Christine]
You were the only, you were the someday
It has always been you and I can’t help it
My heart is jumping when you walk into a room
It doesn’t seem to matter when there's nothing we can undo
After all that has happened, I can’t believe I still want you

[Hook]
And what I want to say is there is no me without you
What I want to say is everything I forgot to
So if it's not too late, I don’t wanna give you away

[Verse 2: Erin Christine]
You keep me grounded, you were my ending
You are the one I go to, I still get nervous when you're around me
Yeah, this is the one thing I can’t lose
It doesn't seem to matter after all I’ve put you through
After all that has happened, I can’t believe I still want you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I see you walking on that tight rope
Should you love me or love me not
I sit back and let you pick the right quote
Lost focus, wasn't looking through the right scope
Before it burns, we should end this on a high note
But if you down for me, spin around for me
Yes to the dress, Vera Wang gown for me
Like Princess Di, diamonds in the crown for me
Whatever ground you walking on, higher ground for me
We locked in like mafia ties, if we together, no leaving like mafia wives
Rather the truth hurts than a body of lies
See, we in this to the death like Bonnie and Clyde, Push

[Bridge: Erin Christine]
Tell me, can you feel it? Tell me, can you feel it?
Just say it, tell me, can you feel it?

[Hook 2]
And what I want to say is there is no me without you
What I want to say is everything I forgot to
If it's not too late, I don’t wanna give you away
And what I want to say is there is no me without you
And what I want to say...so if it's not too late
I don't wanna give you away, what I want to say
