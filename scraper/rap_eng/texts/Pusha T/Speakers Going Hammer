I wake up, early in the morning
Around the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like wassup? wassup?
And ...tad it up, get bang in my truck
Everybody in my city show me love
Because i have the speakers going hammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer
The dough boy version yeah
Back up in this bitch niggers free to go
It was all good just a key ago
Price for the 20 all i need to know
Still moving snow like it's 3 below
Detroit's hard, while I Cape Cod
You niggers little bees to the base guard
I've been cooking, is you mistooking?
Shot town plug got the city junking
Jivon she motorcycle leathers
Mad max 5 stacks before i look this weather
Small circle bad bitches all think they clever
The mix 1 whole shape and recycle better
Sit them on a curve when i'm done with them
She oblivious a girl wanna come with them
Can't blame off another niggers can't run with them
Husein bolt through these bitches then i'm done with them
I wake up, early in the morning
Around the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like wassup? wassup?
And ...tad it up, get bang in my truck
Everybody in my city show me love
Because i have the speakers going hammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer
The dough boy version yeah
See i could tell you ain't gonna be around long
You ain't doing enough motherfucking homework on you nigga
Get it right
