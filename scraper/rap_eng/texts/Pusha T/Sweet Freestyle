[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Get my chain, get my chain
This G.O.O.D. Music
You're sweet to me diabetes
Peace treaties
Breakfast of champions, they need Wheaties
Carrying the torch, the Olympic four rings
I'm a javelin throw from the crowning of the king
I hear em whisper like a hummingbird sings
Of all the trust issues that a hundred birds bring
Now the wolves out hunting for your bling
You're preying on the bitches with the lowest self esteem
It's a common running theme
Victim or vice lord
Disciple or Black stone, what you look to Christ for
We in the last days, fire or the ice storm
I wear it in my chain as a symbol of a crime lord
Let's be honest, the cards on the table
Jealousy's a sin, Cain killed Abel
Backstabber, Caesar had Brutus
It's hard to weed 'em out, even Jesus had Judas
Gone
