[Verse 1: Oritse]
I won't mess you around again
I swear on my life

You've not seen everything I am
That's not what I'm like

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been a little bit proud, a little bit selfish
A little bit cold, a little bit drugged

[Chorus]
Don't let your hand slip out of mine
I know my heart doesn't always show
But you've hit me way down below the waterline
Just take me under one last time
Before we go

[Verse 2: Oritse]
Hard times would always gonna come
Sooner or later
We left love in a precipice there
So we can't fight the change

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been little bit cold, a little bit lonely
A little bit sad, a little bit shy

[Chorus]
Don't let your hand slip out of mine
I know my heart doesn't always show
But you've hit me way down below the waterline
Just take me under one last time
Before we go

[Verse: Pusha T]
You complain, I dismiss like tsk tsk
But you get pissed the nerve of this bit*h
I just wish all the words that we dished
Hopeless, selfish, ain't exist
Hoping, honest, I resist
Oceans, timeless, the abyss
Dive in, what we deciding
It's been too long, plus we dividing
That's simple math, ain't it

[Chorus]
Don't let your hand slip out of mine
I know my heart doesn't always show
But you've hit me way down below the waterline
Just take me under one last time
Before we go

It's all over now, I can't get over that
It's all over now
It's all over now, I can't get over that
It's all over now
