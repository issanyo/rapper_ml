[Intro: Pusha T + Pharrell]
Fly shit
Turn me up some more
Pusha, Skateboard P
Give it to 'em

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
You're that girl
Who thinks the world
Is something beautiful
And that's all baby
But you're lookin' far abroad
Wishing upon the wrong star
'Cause you don't know
That's not how it goes
So, I can't explain
Why things remain the same and others change
He made it that way
But the perplexities of the world
Leaves more oysters and pearls
And I don't know
That's just the way it goes
But I know you can

[Hook]
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
I am yours
Feel the BAPE
It is yours
It is yours
It is yours (Hey!)

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Don't take the time
To relax your mind
So unusual, oh baby
Put your priorities on the shelf
But your emotions and your health just don't go
Your body says no, so
I can't conceive
That leaves would grow on trees
And blow with the breeze
And come back next spring
But the perplexities of life
Brings more days that form new skies
So who's to know
I suppose that you could

[Hook]
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
I am yours
Feel the BAPE
It is yours
It is yours
It is yours (Oh!)

[Bridge: Pharrell + (Pusha T)]
Up, up and away
I'll be the wind that blows your sail
The pixie dust of Tinker Bell
Up, up and away (P, I think we got one, baby)
I'll be the wind beneath your wings (Pusha)
The vivid colors of your dreams, oh (Let's go)

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Baby, let's pour it up
Lift them Gallardo doors up
Paris for them Louis as soon as the tour's up
The million dollar frames is his and her the same
I took it on the chin when I heard about the lame
And no, I ain't here to try to rewrite your past (Nah)
That don't measure up to the nights that we laughed
When considering love, you take the good with the bad
I've been disappointed by every bitch I ever had
Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad
Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags
Reverse it, I want perfect
That was half the reason I bought half them purses
That chapter is over, it was worth it
My new angel surfaced
She ain't have to rehearse it
My baby's real
That's why I put the chill on her
So good make a nigga wanna kneel on herâ€”not yet

[Hook]
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
I am yours
Feel the BAPE
It is yours
It is yours
It is yours (Oh!)
