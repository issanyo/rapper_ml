[Intro: Quentin Miller]
Yeah, yeah whoa
You already know
You should
Hey!

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Took a chance on myself, took a chance on myself
Bet it
Bet it on myself, bet it on myself
Took a chance on myself, bet it all on myself
Ay
Bet it, bet it
Ay
I took a risk, I took a risk
Died trying, I'ma get rich
Yeah, yeah gotta get rich
Bet on myself, going in all of my chips

[Verse 1: Quentin Miller]
You had the chance, then you blew it
Now you look like you been through it
Had to take my shot, I had to shoot it
Tell the waitress dump my drank, steak my plate
I don't need any steak, what does that say?
Literally came from the bottom dog
I got this dog
Bet it all, bet it all

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Took a chance on myself, took a chance on myself
Bet it
Bet it on myself, bet it on myself
Took a chance on myself, bet it all on myself
Ay
Bet it, bet it
Ay
I took a risk, I took a risk
Died trying, I'ma get rich
Yeah, yeah gotta get rich
Bet on myself, going in all of my chips

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Check
I took a risk, I took a brick
Took a road trip to a Motel 6
Get it wholesale and I won't tell shit
Ride coattails and he want that lick
Just another in the mix nigga, I'm rich nigga
Figuring out is you Alpo, is you Mitch nigga
Bet it all, roulette all on my wrist nigga
Set it off like Cleo, takin' yo bitch nigga

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Took a chance on myself, took a chance on myself
Bet it
Bet it on myself, bet it on myself
Took a chance on myself, bet it all on myself
Ay
Bet it, bet it
Ay
I took a risk, I took a risk
Died trying, I'ma get rich
Yeah, yeah gotta get rich
Bet on myself, going in all of my chips
