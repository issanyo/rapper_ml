All you do is complain
I buy you this, I take you there
Now you wanna act like it ain't fair
Find a new love guess it ain't rare
You can be replaced 'case you ain't clear
Yup, OK player, look to my side and you ain't there
Too little time and you﻿ ain't share
End of the road and you ain't there

You hit my cell on Friday, come pick you up outta your place
You tell me I look beautiful, baby that's so unusual
But﻿ then we get to the party, you act like you don't even know me
You laughin' it up, you takin' shots
So drunk you forgot about the girl you brought
You're a fool, you're a damn fool
And it's all you'll ever be
So get a clue, get a damn clue
You'll never find another me
Na Na ooo
Don't treat me like a stranger
(Don't treat me like a stranger)
Na Na ooo
Don't treat me like a stranger
(Don't treat me like a stranger)
I can't﻿ believe how you do me, actin' like you never knew me
I let your love run through me
I feel just like a groupie, Charlie's Sooptie
Perfect strangers, serving goodbyes like a waiter
I'll pack my bags alligator
I hit the road like a stone and roll see ya later
You're a fool, you're a damn fool
And that's all that's all you'll ever be
You're a fool, you're a damn fool
And it's all you'll ever be
So get a clue, get a damn clue
You'll never find another me
Na Na ooo
Don't treat me like a stranger
(Don't treat me like a stranger)
Na Na ooo
Don't treat me like a stranger
(Don't treat me like a stranger)

Thought that life you was made for, they say you get what you pay for
Want no stress so I paid more, now you wanna talk while I game on
I play﻿ on, baller-like, goya bags lubutins and spikes
Take no bags when I board the flight, where I land I'mma score tonight
Let pour tonight cirroc and lime, now we both stuck like a porcupine
Let's get lost so we hard to find, push it to the limit like borderline
(Kay)
Na Na ooo
Don't treat me like a stranger
