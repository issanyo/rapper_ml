[Intro: alt-J]
Zero zero one one one zero zero one one
Cryin' zeros and I'm–
Zero zero one one one zero zero one one
Cryin' zeros and I'm–

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
It's hot at night in the summertime (ooh!)
The summer's mine, that's underlined
King Push, kingpin, put none over mine
Dope boys workin' overtime
Lotta hustle, got an open mind
Real time foreign cars, real time foreign broads
Watch face froze in time, true drug overlord
We just goin' overboard, yacht parties, jet-skis
Say you ballin', let's see
Pull up in the SL, let her do the SC
Ask her what's her ring size, let her do the Gretzky
I just do it king size, all I know is ringside
All we do is celebrate, you knowin' how the king ride
Push!

[Chorus: alt-J]
Zero one one one one zero zero one one
Cryin' zeros and I'm hearing one one ones
Cut my somersault, sign my backflip
Pool summer, summer, pool, pool summer
Zero one one one one zero zero one one
Cryin' zeros and I'm hearing one one ones
Cut my somersault, sign my backflip
Pool summer, summer, pool, pool summer

[Refrain: alt-J]
In cold blood
In cold blood

[Verse 2: alt-J]
Cali, let's dive, dive down
To the pool's bottom where we belong
Cali, you're sinking like a bleeding stone
Heard it down on the radio

[Refrain: alt-J]
In cold blood
In cold blood
In cold blood

[Chorus: alt-J]
Zero one one one one zero zero one one
Cryin' zeros and I'm hearing one one ones
Cut my somersault, sign my backflip
Pool summer, summer, pool, pool summer
Zero one one one one zero zero one one
Cryin' zeros and I'm hearing one one ones
Cut my somersault, sign my backflip
Pool summer, summer, pool, pool summer
