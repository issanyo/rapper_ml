[Verse 1: Malice]
Whether they gag me bound me hollow point round me
Dump me off the side of a bridge and drown me
Spare my family the details on how they found me
Vigil by candle light and gather round me
And talk about how I would lounge with fly women
How I was flossing in clubs in fine linen
Hopping in them ill whips with chrome spinning
Malice was true to the game for 9 innings
We love sinning but now I answer for that
Apologize to my fam I got you all dressing in black
A long line family and friends they signing in
My niece singing solo organs and violins
Wife in her black veil hands flooded with diamonds
Remaining calm under each arms my children
Daddys in a better place entering golden doors
With ivory all white pillars and marble floors
Brand new physical frame with no flaws
On my throne thats guarded by angels with 4-4's
Terrar retaliate show em how real it be
A split second 'fore you blazed they probably thought you was me
Returning on some Crow shit let em know shit
They mess with the wrong click quick to blow shit
Yall know who owned this so they end my career
But still I put my tag on this earth Malice was here

[Hook] x2
Take a walk on my side
No more tears no more fears no more telling me lies
I only want cheers and heartfelt goodbyes
My death march is here tell me whos gonna ride

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Hold me high Gucci suit and tie
Let my casket reach the sky tell my girl don't cry
Just sing me a lullaby and let the white doves fly
Cuz I heard from a bird its only sleep when you die
Break me in unison outside right thru the lens
My mother cried cuz she knew that I was only true to sin
Celebrate my passing with gun shots and systems blasting
Blown up posters of Terrar held by children laughing
No matter how foul my burial open casket
Now simply so they can see my clusters and my diamonds smiling
Im sorry I failed only cuz the ones I left were so real
For me my doggs will lie, die, shoot, cry, or kill
First to Malice sorry that I left you half in a hole
But now you'll write for both of us ill channel thoughts thru your soul
Emmanuel remember this when you see my nemesis
Drop my picture on his chest and make his family reminisce
Revenge so sweet and I crush you with the heat
Your the first one I call when its time to put em to sleep
Now Pharrell grand dragon horns stabbing the skys
Turn Magnum, laser tag em couldn't sever all ties
My final request on the day im laid to rest
Take my body to the ocean and have a water front ves'
This will be my burial this eulogy will be in stereo
Blue Angels will draw my face in smoke during an aerial

[Hook] x4
