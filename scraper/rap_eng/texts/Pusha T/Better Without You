[Verse 1: Innanet James]
I felt like I done got my life back
Since you gone ain’t no need to write back
It’s all good the hoes know how I live big time
Know I like the lights bright
It’s all good really why I work hard
To do what I want and do what I feel to what we did again in ya whip
Again and again let’s get in gear
Park and spark in ya Benz
Ya talkin ya shit talkin for a record in Guinness a regular nigga would care
But I ain’t regular baby they close the stores when I’m shopping
The peace of mind is amazing
And bring me water with a lemon on a tray with a bagel
So we can talk our differences over salmon and wine
Lil water and truth I’m more than assured we be fine
You can dry ya eyes the seats leather please don’t cry
No tears here and baby we gon be alright

[Hook: KALLITECHNIS]
It’s been way too long since I knew what it’s like to win alone
I been making it though, making it through
Watch me thrive cause I’m better without you
It’s been way to long since I knew what it’s like to win alone
I been making it though, making it through
Watch me thrive cause I’m better without you
Cause I’m Better without you, cause I’m better without you
Yeaaaaa oooooo yeaaaa

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Look she only do it for the internet
Well if you into that you can win her back
My heart’s cold I can show you where the winter’s at
It’s a small circle we where the winners at
If I doubt you I’m better off without you
You barely had a pony tail when I found you
Look around you bunch of red noses in clown shoes
It’s silly that a circus surrounds you
So together we like dumb and dumber
I’m a brand baby can’t fuck behind a runner
I be damned if I share that pussy with a plumber
I’m the one that make ya stock rise by the summer ooouu
But what’s done is done so now the run is done
And only time will tell who’s the real one of one
Write you off as my last year summer fun
It’s crystal clear where I’m coming from Push

[Hook: KALLITECHNIS]
It’s been way too long since I knew what it’s like to win alone
I been making it though, making it through
Watch me thrive cause I’m better without you
It’s been way to long since I knew what it’s like to win alone
I been making it though, making it through
Watch me thrive cause I’m better without you
Cause I’m Better without you, cause I’m better without you
Yeaaaaa oooooo yeaaaa
