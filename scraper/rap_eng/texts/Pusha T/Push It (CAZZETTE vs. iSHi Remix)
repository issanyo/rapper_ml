[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Push it to the limit, if you wanna win it
Harbor no room for the weak, nor the timid
Bit too long, you got accustomed to the gimmicks
It's like they don’t care that the real is at the finish
No blemish, no honor
Let the flutes go, the snake charmer
The kingpin of every street corner
You can't say I didn't never warn ya

[Instrumental]
Rockin’ with the, rockin' with the
Rockin' with the, rockin' with the
Push it, yeah
Push, push

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I've been pushin', yes, I've been cookin'
Road trips, them risks, they’ve been tooken
Been ballin’, hoes, they been lookin'
I first class your flights, I’ve been bookin'
One in Bed-Stuy, she's so Brooklyn
I can't dodge her, she’s so Crooklyn
They let the crooks in, we let the guns blow
All you see is bright lights through the gun smoke

[Instrumental]
Rockin' with the, rockin' with the
Rockin' with the, rockin' with the
Push it, yeah
Push, push

[Outro]
Rockin' with the, rockin' with the
Rockin' with the, rockin' with the
