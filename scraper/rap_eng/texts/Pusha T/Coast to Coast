[Pusha T]
Cars with chauffeurs sockless loafers
Snap my finger nigga buenos noches
We the Black Cards
Bar none put whoever on us
My jewels is like a flute to you bitches
I'm the snake charmer

[Ab Liva]
You can’t keep following niggas that break honor
I'm driven in that double R I- drive system
More horses near the pistons
The logistics the left arm glisten
As I exit the car with the partition

[Sandman]
And half of you niggas wishing
Y’all was in our position getting
Sloppy kisses from model bitches
By rocky wrist’s
Or the unbelievable vehicle breezing through
Leaving you pissed whispering
Life is a bitch

[Pusha T]
Every dollar ever tricked was never missed
Im trifling rich i mannequin hoes to floss my shit
To every bitch i ever barbie-dolled
It was only to heighten and enlighten
But instead i just misguided y’all

[Ab liva]
They document the rise and fall of footprints
Of hustlers turn legends in they times of war
Blow money cars line the shore
We reincarnated with their stars faded
And they crimes were flawed

[Sandman]
While y'all niggas Scarfacing whole face in the soft
Busy sniffing to your nostrils raw and your nose fall off
Me and my niggas is living the difference
Flipping the pigeons [?]

[Pusha T]
I fell off in the pot in the kitchen
Peeling open them pigeons
Pure white like the powder was christian
Ain't no such thing as a seven
Unless you’re talking McLaren
Those scissor doors open like the Gangster heaven

[?] to Boston George
To Philadel' like it's martial law
Gun drawn the sun fall on the concrete
Jungle as they juggle
All my shit in crack spots the nerve
The label me slumlord

[Sandman]
Evicted stupid ass young bulls
Playing with loot playing your stoop
Selling you dry wall
I guess you feeling Bruce Willis
Cause you going to die hard
Chasing you breath
While facing your death
As we slide off

[Pusha T]
We never mind cost
Croc and alligator shit lives lost
Closet like the Land of the Lost
PETA screaming murder
Furs you never heard of
Drowned in that shearling
I'm the fucking sheep herder

[Ab Liva]
These young niggas jump in the game
Hoping to leap further
Now that Fire white ice adores is a
Sleeve burner in love with a mean corner
Mean earner think sweet my burner
I have you fight for your life like you
C-Murder

[Sandman]
She's perfect we stepping through
Black white like Pepe Lepew
Bright lights what these gremlins spew
No Strife when you catch these few
You past due
Coast to coast hood to hood
Get money playa it's all good
Niggas tussle to struggle
Scuffle to hustle to muffle to muscle
Fall back damn I really would love to
But can't though
Coast to coast hood to hood
Get money playa it's all good
Niggas tussle to struggle
Scuffle to hustle to muffle to muscle
Fall back damn I really would love to
But can't though
