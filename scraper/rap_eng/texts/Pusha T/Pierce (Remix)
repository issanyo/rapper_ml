[Intro: Dominic Lord & Pusha T]
Fuck away to never wait on weight
My life, my white
Like my wife throw rice
My life, my white
Like my wife throw rice
Posh living goes far
Posh living goes far
Posh living goes far
You could suffer

[Verse 1: Dominic Lord]
Be who you want, I ain’t stopping ya
Pin ya pin ya pin ya
Down girl, en guard, fuck with the gun child
You gonna need your guns now (blood bath)
For my décor
Tell me your desires whore
Say what you want, it ain't on record
For the record, crossed fingers behind my back
Opposites, they’s do attract
But may become failure
T is up, now I hate you piercing
On your navel, same when you
Drop the cradle, let’s talk now, under the table

[Hook: Dominic Lord]
I don’t wanna give anymore
I don’t wanna be here anymore
I don’t wanna give anymore
I don’t wanna be here anymore
But if you’ll leave, I’ll stay
Yeah, you go
But if you’ll leave, I’ll stay
Here, you go

[Bridge v.1: Pusha T]
My life, my white
Like my wife throw rice

[Verse 2: Pusha]
Throw money, dope money
Carol Ann, poltergeist
A ghost nigga, go getter
Go yell, now go figure
God damn, I go hard
Top off, go kart
Artistic, Warhol
Musical, Mozart
Black nigga, Batman
That dark knight, I Joe Clark
Ask you, you smoke crack?
Better question, you soul-lack
Acting like they'd never tell
It pierce my heart when they told that

[Hook]

[Bridge v.2: Dominic Lord]
Posh living goes far
Posh living goes far

[Verse 3: Dominic Lord]
I lost my L, steal my car, had to, oh well
Oh hell nigga, wussup?
Where my mail?
I wanna read my shit
Niggas wanna be my shit white
What you know but my shit for
All over my shit you gon be shot like it’s army go kank ‘er
Came to party, fuck around and crash your Ferrari
That'll raise the price right, better hey you like a’ight
We? Who? We pushin’ it as we army
Ain’t a motherfucker try to bomb me
So I’m ‘pposed to react to this shit
Motherfuckers runnin' coughin'
Like they’re actually sick
