[Verse 1]
Ooh, there go my baby daddy
Pullin' up like "Hey girl, leggo"
Ooh, see I ain’t pushin' that Caddy
We never leavin' this place
Mmm, it's all go (it’s all go)
It’s so throwed (So throwed)
So throwed (so throwed)
Ooh, the hood ain't ready
It’s the mentality of hate

[Chorus]
Coming from the street life we know, it's letting go
We like to go to school for education
But the street life we know don’t write no notes
It’s like parole with the time we’re facin'

[Bridge]
Ooh, ain't nobody gon' help
Ooh, tryna survive themselves
Ooh, these are cards we are dealt
The name of the game is money

[Hook]
The newspaper call it street life
The recession eatin' me alive
Tryna get where the breeze is nice
So I can breathe
Everybody round me tryna get to the money
Including me

[Verse 2]
Ooh, my best friend named Abby
Be up in and leave like waiter, XO
Ooh, and she be rolling that fatty
And puffing long as it takes
Yeah, ‘cause life is so cold (so cold)
So cold (so cold)
And he’s foes go
You're the truth is her mind ain’t ready
For what she got the next day

[Chorus]
Coming from the street life we know, it's letting go
We like to go to school for education
But the street life we know don’t write no notes
It’s like parole with the time we’re facin'

[Bridge]
Ooh, ain't nobody gon' help
Ooh, tryna survive themselves
Ooh, these are cards we are dealt
Momma didn't raise no dummy

[Hook]
Headline read street life
The recession eatin' me alive
Tryna get where the breeze is nice
So I can breathe
Everybody 'round me tryna get to the money

[Verse: Pusha T]
We just tryin' to get to the money
This for my niggas with them full baby mamas
Ceiling full of comma's
Saving your receipts 'cause she never keep a promise
This presidential Rollie don’t make me Obama
So don’t judge me by my jewelry, please, your honor
The persona of this dope dealing summertime
Top dropper wintertime
Fool ain’t fox rocker
Wooh! What it be like?
It’s just king pushing Kelly roll, giving you the street life
Brap!

[Chorus]
Coming from the street life we know, it's letting go
We like to go to school for education
But the street life we know don’t write no notes
It’s like parole with the time we’re facin'

[Bridge]
Ooh, ain't nobody gon' help
Ooh, tryna survive themselves
Ooh, these are cards we are dealt
Ain't shit from him hunny

[Chorus]
Tell a bum about the street life
The recession eatin' me alive
Tryna get where the breeze is nice
So I can breathe
Everybody 'round me tryna get to the money
Including me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo!
