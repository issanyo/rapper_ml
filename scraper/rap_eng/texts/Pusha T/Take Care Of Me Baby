[Verse 1: Cassie]
It's not about me, I do this for you
Still wanna talk shit about everything I do
Crazy thing about it - I'm gettin' high
Way out in space while you wait down in the sky
Crazy thing about it - I'm getting paid
If you knew what I had saved â€” attitude might change
Crazy thing about it - I'm doing me
While we do each other, it's like a movie scene
Crazy thing about it - everything been crazy
So I look at you in my mirror and say "take care of me, baby"

[Hook]
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Take care of you - I don't care if I'm buying
GTs, VVs - small thing to a giant
Tapped phones track hoes, what's the use of you spying?
Her furs, your furs house cat to a lion
I ain't doing no lying - I ain't doing no creepin'
All I'm missing is a jack-o-lantern, trick or treating's in season
All your jewels is now freezin', all your pumps is now teasin'
Every heel is like 6-inch, all your jeans is now squeezin'
When you in it for the long haul, you crawl with her, you ball with her
She shotgun, and my milk Ghost so damn ripe, I'mma spoil with her
Like Jodeci, she forever my lady
On a talk show, I'll tell Maury I'mma take care of that baby

[Verse 3: Cassie]
Baby, even if we lost everything, I'd be right there
It's crazy when you know you've got everything sitting right there
Crazy thing about it - they the ones confused
Paying us all this attention when I know they could use
At least a couple more dollars - meanwhile, I'm cool
These diamonds keep me cool
They just mad cause you always

[Hook]
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
Take care of me, baby
