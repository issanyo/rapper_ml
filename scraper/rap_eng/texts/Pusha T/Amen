[Intro]
In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night, rich, wealthy
Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking for
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray
Amen

[Interlude: Young Jeezy]
Yeah (amen) you like that right? (amen)
I wrote it myself by the way (amen)
Yo Young, Jeezy, Jizzle, Snowman (amen, amen)
We gotta give the streets what they want, man (amen)
Fuck the goddamn shit (amen)
You gotta get it in, bruh, let's get it (amen)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You like that don’t you? I wrote it myself by the way
And I don’t mean to be selfish
But I picture myself getting paid
And you might catch pneumonia
'Cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh
Me and Pusha back on it
Now everybody help us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I’m trying to get paid

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Trying to get saved (too late!) time to get paid
Got a gun and a stocking mask
Niggas thought I was trying to get waves
I’mma let all ya’ll niggas pray for it
My young niggas knocking off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back-end
Only fucking way I’mma pay for it
Front that shit, you put a flame on
My niggas locked in a cage for
They keep telling me to go hard
#1 spot you was made for
Yuugh! I made more
Front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red
"Glow In The Dark" like a Ye tour
Fuck niggas stepping in my lane for
Not knowing that it’s a land mine
Soon as a nigga feels a cool breeze
Throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue, Crip or Blood
Solitaires, diamond studs
Like chandeliers I’mma flood
Black Jesus piece like it’s dipped in mud
Fashion gods, notice mine
Rollerball spikes, I’m Pokémon
Paris shit, Louboutin
Under bright lights, where do you belong?

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starving, niggas they can’t find no yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Amen, how many people do you know hatin’?
On your downfall sitting their waitin’
When you shine, don't know what they gonna say then
Everything I do now stadiums
So tell me what they really gon’ say to him
And I’m headed straight to the ATM
Finna go HAM, nigga finna go in
Nigga you'll get it when pigs fly
When Yeezy fake, Devil’s pie
Piece of cake, Kit-Kat
I need a break, God’s child
Jesus Christ, club like a broken neck
I need the ice, I need the lights, uhh
In Egypt they fightin’ for freedom
Cop pull you over for no reason, beat him

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starving, niggas they can’t find no yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
I got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team
Even seen them come 2-tone like a saleen (saleen?)
Saleen, yeah that’s a Mustang
Break ‘em down in the night, that's what I call hustling
They say they want that dumb shit, well this is ignorant
Condo on the timepiece, yeah now that's ignorant
They like, "Young, you a fool", yeah I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block and tried to sew up half the streets
I’m on 75-75, when they was going for the 25
Guess who’s pickin’ up a trey? Just an ordinary day
With extraodinary pay, extraordinary risk
Can’t even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it cause I lived it man, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony, “Don't you fuck with me”

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
Please Lord, help, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starving, niggas they can’t find no yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

[Outro: Young Jeezy]
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen
