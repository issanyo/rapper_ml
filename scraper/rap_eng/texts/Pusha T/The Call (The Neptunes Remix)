[Intro: Pharrell]
Let's party

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Imagine the Backstreet Boys here with the Neptunes
Call it the rec room, play time now, holla
Pusha be one if you follow, slo' mow, low-low
Thousand spoke on the gold Impala
Crushin', love my women in couples (what)
One on each arm, keep double the trouble (yeah)
So I gotta, shift 'em and shuffle, love how I twist 'em and tussle
Sex play, next day, call me, uh

[Verse 2: AJ]
Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said no, someone's waiting for me
But I called my girl up and said

[Chorus: Backstreet Boys]
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry, just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby, gotta go!"

[Verse 3: Nick]
Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

[Chorus: Backstreet Boys]
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry, just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby, gotta go!"

[Bridge: Pharrell & Backstreet Boys]
Dance
Hello? Listen baby I'm sorry
Dance
Hello? Listen baby I'm sorry

[Verse 4: Malice]
Don't stay up and wait
'Cause I'ma be somewhere late
I feel for ya if you can't relate
I take it aways, like two day stays
But look, still hit me on my two-way page
See, I'm heavy in the streets like a cream Denali (uh)
Cold outside? We take trips to Maui (c'mon)
AJ, Brian, Kevin, Nick and Howie (what)
Accompanied by Clipse; Pusha T and Mali

[Reprise: Nick & (AJ)]
Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing there in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
(Gotta go)

[Chorus: Backstreet Boys]
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry, just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby, gotta go!"
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry, just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby, gotta go!"

[Outro: Backstreet Boys & (Pharrell)]
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby, gotta go
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby, gotta go
(Say what?)
We're going to a place nearby (Say what?)
We're going to a place nearby (Say what?)
Gotta go (Gotta go!)
Hello?
Hello?
Haha, yeah
Let's party, know why?
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
I gotta go, girl
