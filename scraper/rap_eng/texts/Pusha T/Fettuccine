[Hook: Future]
I got that fettuccine on me, I got that fettuccine
I got that fettuccine on me, I got that fettuccine
I got that fettuccine on me, now I spend it quick
Ain't fuck up on the cash with my bitch
I got that fettuccine on me, I got that fettuccine
I got that fettuccine on me, I got that fettuccine
I got that fettuccine on me, now I spend it quick
Order up that Lambo, put me on the list

[Verse One: Future]
Order up the Lamborghini, put me on the list
All the fettuccine, I can clone a bad bitch
Take her out of Bakers, now she shop at Jeffrey's
I'm on a roll, getting money, got a bad recession
What type of nigga you know in the middle of the hood worth some tickets?
What type of nigga you know sell out shows play with fishes?
Gucci, Louie, Prada, that's the way a nigga kick it
I got a whole bird on me, nothing to be specific
Ice, ice, ice like I jumped in the Pacific water
Money, money, money and that shit coming in digits
I got 50 cent on me on my way to Walt Disney
That's a whole 50 racks, young nigga with the business

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Pusha T]
I got that fettuccine on me, tell me what you see
You can't be in Aldo standing next to me
Out them bitches pronto, out that R&B
Hit Paris for that poncho, the G's sound like Z's
Givenchy, Veuve Clicq, menage a trois, c'est la vie
I sell it all, he mail it all
Slow gift wrap, need a Christmas card
Champagne pour, I christen y'all
You niggas hating
I'm lifting off in private jets
We peeling out
In them Porsche Panameras that we wheeling out

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Emilio Rojas]
I look a bitch in her ass 'fore I look a bitch in her eye
I see the bitch in y'all swag, I give a fuck if y'all fly
I'm cheap though, I'm staying paid, I'mma make it rain
And I'mma take the train, I'm Latino, got razor blades
Okay chico but it ain't to shave, I got pesos, I got pesos
Bad hoes by the caseload and she gonna get a face full
And she gonna get a face full so pardon if the kid narcissistic
I'm shining bright, it'd be hard to miss it, I heard y'all in Target
Thrifting while I'm buying out the whole Garment District
No room in the whole room, don't clean clothes
I hit show room, she's anorexic, no food
So it's half the check up in Noble, I got bad habits and good habits
Cheat a lot cause I'm good at it, fuck a bitch for her bank account
When I'm done with it, the whole hood have it
