[Chorus: Fresh]
I don' seen the best of 'em jammed up (oouu)
Twenty-five to life in the can's tough (ooouuu)
Never met a man that they can't touch (ooouuuu)
Quit talkin' on the phone, they can hear us (oouu)

[Verse 1: Berner]
When you got dumb cake up in the gun safe
They be waitin' for you in the bushes with the duct tape
Up and down the interstate, yeah, we really touch weight
It's October, I'm about to flood another state
He went down in Arizona, don't get me involved
An empty box and a call means they comin' for all
I had 6 burner phones, I got rid of 'em all
We get hit and sit down, we don't talk to the law
Yeah they think I'm trippin', they listenin'
They know our every move, yeah they want us all in prison
That why I can't see sleep at night untill they get in
We wrap 'em and we ship, I'm on another mission
I'm just young and I'm livin'

[Chorus: Fresh]
I don' seen the best of 'em jammed up (oouu)
Twenty-five to life in the can's tough (ooouuu)
Never met a man that they can't touch (ooouuuu)
Quit talkin' on the phone, they can hear us (oouu)

[Bridge: Berner]
It's 7 in the mornin' and they in my home
My bank account is froze, what is goin' on?
Why it all start goin' wrong?
From talkin' on the phones

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
My phone still echo, the Feds won't let go
Money never sleeps when you the black Gordon Gekko
Dope line lookin' like they waitin' on the retro
6s, fixes, damn I feel special
Resale and I never pay retail
My shoe box money afforded me the Sprewells
And that then courted me a V-12
Avoid the phone if it's soundin' like a sea shell
Too much clickin' in the connection
Connect the dots with my connect for my protection
Face to face, I place my order like a drive-thru
Fill the trunk, you know how I do, push

[Chorus: Fresh]
I don' seen the best of 'em jammed up (oouu)
Twenty-five to life in the can's tough (ooouuu)
Never met a man that they can't touch (ooouuuu)
Quit talkin' on the phone, they can hear us (oouu)

[Bridge: Berner]
It's 7 in the mornin' and they in my home
My bank account is froze, what is goin' on?
Why it all start goin' wrong?
From talkin' on the phones

[Verse 3: Conway]
I don't fuck with too many nigga, handle business on my own
'Cause you niggas ain't right and that's some shit I don't condone
I got homies behind the wall, wishin' they was home
They got jammed up, kept discussin' business on the phone
Biscotti turkey bags, boy, we burn up zips
200 bands off them 20 dollar burn up flips
I'm going by myself when it's time to burn up quick
That way police don't have a clue when niggas turn up stiff
(ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
I'm dolo when I'm out makin' different moves
Pull up to the cookie shop just to pick and choose
I'm that nigga, don't get that shit confused
'Cause even when them niggas prayed I did, I didn't lose, Machine

[Chorus: Fresh]
I don' seen the best of 'em jammed up (oouu)
Twenty-five to life in the can's tough (ooouuu)
Never met a man that they can't touch (ooouuuu)
Quit talkin' on the phone, they can hear us (oouu)

[Bridge: Berner]
It's 7 in the mornin' and they in my home
My bank account is froze, what is goin' on?
Why it all start goin' wrong?
From talkin' on the phones
