[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
They say they're cold-blooded
Yeah, he cold-blooded
Your neck too soft, put a knife to it
Funeral room zone, get your wife to it (Woo)
They say he cold-blooded
Upperhand, who want it? Huh?
Yeah, he cold-blooded
Hit everythin in the daylight, huh?
Police ain't comin' for some hours
Niggas ain't really talkin' for some hours
You gon' die if you try to take ours
Boy, we cold-blooded, ha

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Black child born in the storm
They had to bundle up to stay warm
Bodega babies
Strollers in the snow to the candy lady
That sugar make the monsters of the '90s crazy
Child rebel soldiers of the inner city
The hate me now, tigers next to Nas and Diddy
His mama fell in love with drug dealin' Diddy
The only star left that was next to Biggie
Little did she know, she was one of four
And little did he know, he was one of eight
Unknown siblings all through middle school
With the same mean mug that was born from hate
Yeah, bodega babies
You wonder why these kids of the '90s crazy?
Hide and go seek when the father's lazy
And their mamas only want the early '90s Jay-Zs

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
They say they're cold-blooded
Yeah, he cold-blooded
Your neck too soft, put a knife to it
Funeral room zone, get your wife to it (Woo)
They say he cold-blooded
Upperhand, who want it? Huh?
Yeah, he cold-blooded
Hit everythin in the daylight, huh?
Police ain't comin' for some hours
Niggas ain't really talkin' for some hours
You gon' die if you try to take ours
Boy, we cold-blooded, ha

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
They said his skin wasn't light enough
And his future wasn't bright enough
Little sister don't talk much
'Cause their uncle had the Midas touch
Evil is as evil doez
Mama looked away, blamed it on his needle buzz
Sold the food out the freezer when he needed drugs
Beggin' like he Cool J when he needed love
Yeah, bodega babies
You wonder why these kids of the '90s crazy?
Broken Black homes is the modern slavery
You can't raise a savage and deny the rabies
Woo, bodega babies
Yeah, bodega babies
How loud I got to scream for someone to save me?
And now I'm in the cell from everything you made me

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
They say they're cold-blooded
Yeah, he cold-blooded
Your neck too soft, put a knife to it
Funeral room zone, get your wife to it (Woo)
They say he cold-blooded
Upperhand, who want it? Huh?
Yeah, he cold-blooded
Hit everythin in the daylight, huh?
Police ain't comin' for some hours
Niggas ain't really talkin' for some hours
You gon' die if you try to take ours
Boy, we cold-blooded, ha
