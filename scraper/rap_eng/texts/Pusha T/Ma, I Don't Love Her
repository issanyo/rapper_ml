[Pharell]
I wanna love you girl
Just wanna love you girl
Please let me love you girl
Just wanna love you girl
C'mon, I wanna love you girl
Just wanna love you girl
Let me love you girl
Let me...

[Pusha T]
When we met I was talkin' that game
Parkin' that thang
Since then between us
A lot of things changed
Now it's like the world got a whole different name
I can't stop chicks from sayin' my name
Most of it's lies
If not, don't be surprised
You knew I was ballin' when I met you
But really, I started layin' low just to net you
I'm raw as hell yet can't deny that you special
These girls can't either
Winter, his and her Vivas
Summer, his and her Louie sneakers
You don't think that bother people
Guess again you even need to check your friends
Sayin that I cheat
Right, maybe with my heat
Got a pearl handled chrome thing that I call Sweets
I greet wit her, creep wit her, even eat wit her
Late nights under my sheets, yeah I sleep with her
But thats it

Chorus:
[Pusha T + Malice with Faith Evans] (Faith)
Look
Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it
Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit (No)
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit (No)
If the answers no don't forget (How's she know you then)
I don't know

[Malice]
If I don't know I don't know, lets not go that road
I don't know who she is, don't care who told
Look stop flippin', no need to explode
I seen the number in the pager, I don't know that code
In the streets too much, c'mon, that's absurd
Gettin' no complaints when I be flippin' them birds
Your girls just talk 'bout this that and the third
Believe half what you see none of what you heard
You askin' me who's her I'm askin' who's mink fur
With that rock on her hand makin' their eyes blurred
Could that be you plus who cop every gem
Who spend like I spend, then act like it then
Got the dream home and we settled in it
Our lives too perfect that's why they meddle in it
Now, just chalk it up as just part of the game
You know who I'm about, who got part of my name?

Chorus

[Faith] (Malice)
Do you love me babe (Sho' you right)
You thinkin' of me babe (Well atleast tonight)
I bet you'd tell me anything (Yea thats right)
Just to be with me (Yep and tonight's the night)
(2X)

[Malice]
I'm not most men my heart truer than theirs
Of course your girls hate, our whips newer than theirs
We hardly fight, arguements way fewer than theirs
Even down to the ice, look, bluer than theirs
What they gonna tell us about us, Huh?
What they talk 'bout without us, Huh?
The envy got 'em speakin loosely
Tell 'em walk in your shoes
But first let 'em know they Gucci

[Pusha T]
And even if I did twist her
I promise I didn't kiss her
Wasn't shit touchy feely
Grudge on the floor like Mister did to Celie
No respect shown
My homies laugh while she talk dirty on the speaker phone
Now don't you start
I spared your heart
If you ain't see it I didn't do it
Ain't I played my part?
Bricks, chicks, whips, chips, that just go with the grind
What else do you want from me, to say it, fine

Chorus

[Faith] (Malice) (*with Pharell's verse in background*)
Do you love me babe (Sho' you right)
You thinkin of me babe (Well at least tonight)
I bet you'd tell me anything (Yea thats right)
Just to be with me (Yep and tonight's the night)
(2X)

[Faith, Pusha T + Malice]
That's not it
