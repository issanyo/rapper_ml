[Hook]
As I stay on my grind, gotta feed my family and my niggas
Ain't no if ands with me and my triggers
And these lead shots won't understand
Whatever your situation that there's your mess to fix
Re-Up won't go for it
Guns ring sing like vocalist, emotionless


[Verse 1]
I guess I caught a brick according to sound scan
The critical acclaim was that of the proud man
Prepare for the worst, that blood's on Jive's hands
See when the Fury dropped so did 80,000 grams
Add that to my 80 thousand fans
Snow, blizzard blindin, it wasn't the climate
All-Star Vegas them bitches thought I went diamond
Standing on a chair, the go-getters stared
Dope boys going crazy throwin' money in the air
Where it lands it falls live life without a care
One tilt of the scale and that money's back here
It's been a lot of talk within this last year
But it ain't enough armor for niggas to clash here
I see you niggas pussy I'm calling you pap smear
Who supply the ghetto, who fire metal
Shaking them boots look in the eyes of the devil... Emotionless

[Verse 2]
? kingdom of heaven I sittin' in
I said enough to top five writers in the game
My name's penciled in ELITE, you can't test my pen
I'll be extensive then
Tap dance all over these instruments with penmanship
Black card membership summer time red toy black horse insignia
Sittin low, doors to the sky that's my winner shit
Fall give em war but the Merci rise low and Stan Smith that's my tennis shit
Bracelets no blemishes
Fly nigga dope dealer swag
You can't stand the rain  call diminishes
Fly shit you thought that you talk I give 'em sentences
Them Wraith that you think that you started I give 'em finishes
The grand finale, you can do the tally
Pigeons on the car out in Cali, the Audi
A8 four rings call it John Salley
Re-Up Gang album comin' finally

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
He couldn't see the sky though it was so clear
Til his eyes ran dry of the tears
And then still it's too real for a nigga not to fear
So he's stuck in the stands catching chills, His men ill
They feel they could've stopped the shit
A bitch nigga on some proctor shit
His man was, at least to me
He never did nothing to eat
Watch another nigga feast then act like he do a piece
Broke em off proper
He got hit and died, want the facts, find the doctor
Coroners whoever we drawn 'em in and warn we
Whoever try to stop these the vehicles jewels
Private pools, schools watching my kids snooze
Repeatin' to myself, losing unoptional
Gots to hold my grip, so I goes through this
So who I love don't go through shit
At this point I'm emotionless


[Verse 4]
The older I get the colder my heart grow
I'm surprised I could smile with such sorrow
And inside I keep it bottled
I'm numb to this shit like my pilot is on auto
My only alternative the pyro
Is this rap shit and that it's self's a side show
Truth be told, I've been feeling different lately
Like fuck money, and the dollar is the devil's baby
I'm empty inside like hollowman
I'm here but I'm not like a hologram
Barry said P is selfish as hell
I was like stay in place homie watch yourself
Now this man could place my life upon a shelf
And as for P he is yet to wish me well
So there it is I pick my bone
Toast to CEO Mal, I sip alone
