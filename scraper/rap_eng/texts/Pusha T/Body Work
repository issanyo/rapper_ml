[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Mhmm
I got some killers so don't push me, Juicy J be on some mob shit
Waiting by your doorstep, hidin' in the bushes (mhmm)
If it comes down to it, ain't no thang but to do it
Got a vest on, got a gun that can really do it (mhmm)
You niggas playin' with real niggas' money, get fronted
One day you is the plug, next day you in the dumpster
Couldn’t keep it one hunnid, you thirty-two percent (mhmm)
The police got you on a leash, nigga you a bitch

[Hook: Juicy J]
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga we spraying
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talking bout the Klan
This ain't no arcade nigga, so quit playing
It’s eating time, me and my niggas buffeting
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga we spraying
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talking bout the Klan
This ain’t no arcade nigga, so quit playing
It’s eating time, me and my niggas buffeting

You don’t know about this life, nigga
Earning all of these stripes, nigga

Throwin bitches on flights, nigga
They ain't know that they dyke, nigga
'Til the money’s out and the bottle's pouring
They’re in the midst of they life, nigga
Rose gold on my wrist, this Rolex like Devil's piss
This Daytona illuminate, y'all think I'm talking that devil shit
This fifty racks, no bezel shit

Spraying niggas now the Lord got 'em, rrrah!
Bullets out the barrel make your body jerk
Fuck with my money and I'll hit you with that body work

Shout my lawyer all the crazy shit I ever did

Straight cash nigga, fuck that loan, seven digits on that phone
Money so long, smoke a whole zone
Getting blood money, tryna put my cuz on
Bitch I'm on fire, got my jaw wired
Sex, money, murder - Petey Rollack (Soundview, whaddup)
Body work, chopper work like a techno song
Twenty thou' a show, I just hope my nigga Max come home (wavey)
Money fast, diamonds flash like high beams
Make it rain in this bitch - Hurricane Irene
