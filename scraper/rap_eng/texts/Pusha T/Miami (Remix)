[Chorus: Valee]
Margielas like these came with no shoe strings in 'em (yeah)
My car don't like keys, that bitch push to start, isn't it? (yeah)
I bought some Balmains and I put some Gs in it (yeah)
Went to the ball game and I got floor seats, didn't I? (yeah)
I took 20 thou' and went to Miami (yeah)
Went to Club LIV and it came in handy (yeah)
100 dollar bill, you dig what I'm stammin'? (yeah)
I got the AK outside so don't panic (yeah)

[Verse 1: Valee]
I had took a zip in the airport, I needed it (fuck it)
Bought a caesar salad and I put the weed in it (yeah)
Tequila and lime taste like it's seaweed in it (yeah)
Poured a eight of slime, I'm finna put some tea with it (yeah)
Since I'm in the foreign, I keep 93 in it (yeah)
Bitch, your head boring, so you get a D in it (yeah)
I hopped on the Boeing, it was three more seats in it (yeah)
Gucci flip-flops on, I just slid my feet in 'em (yeah)

[Chorus: Valee]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Look, I just called Ferrari, told them build me one (skrt)
Six months for the wait, even with the ceiling gone (too true)
I'm still selling weight, Hoodrich Pablo Juan (Push)
Narcos still lives, even with Pablo gone (yuugh)
His and hers Chanel Pharrells, ain't no other parallel
40K to ride this wave, on it like a carousel
Cartier, Cartier, Collins Ave, Ocean Drive (Push)
Bal Harbour, ball harder, that'll make her open wide (ooh)
