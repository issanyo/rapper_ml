Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up out my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m ’bout to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

[Verse 1]
Started with 28 grams and a hammer
Bitch look at me now, I'm Tony Montana
Gave me 2 options, hell or the slammer
They forgot the third, I’m on top, antenna
Winter time, bags at the mall, bad Santa
Fifths plaza, Lennox Square Mall, Atlanta
Twinkle toe, Louboutins, hoes love glamour
Black and white diamonds in the chain, that’s panda
Good Music calendar, Def Jam planner
Now everybody fans and the feds got cameras
Off white top on the coup like dandruff
Turn them k’s over white girls, that's Vanna
Sell him 10, front another 10, That’s standard
He asked to get fronted 20 more. That’s random
See the signs, cut the nigga short, That’s cancer
Kill him then kiss his mama﻿ cheek, That’s manners
