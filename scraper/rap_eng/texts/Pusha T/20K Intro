Dram, I really be feeling like that and shit though for real like
Like I really feel like it's the beginning of the end for a lot of motherfuckers
Like, like think about it.Live nigga rap is back
Like all I get over shit all that super stupid shit
Like that shit is done, that shit is done
Keep it real like, that's one thing you gotta say about us
Like We've been consistent since day one
Well this Clipse Re-Up Gang you always know what you gonna get from us
It is what it is
For real, for example like Tree-Huging-ass bithce came up to me the other day on some:
"Yo ya all nice and all but like, how come you all over talking about dope?"
"How come ya all always talking about street shit?" Like, like "come one!"
I was like "Tree-Huggin'-ass bitch, please!"
I rhyme for my niggas one the corner
All 20 thousand of 'em
20k money making brothers on the corner
