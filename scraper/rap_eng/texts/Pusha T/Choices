[Verse 1: Tracy T]
Came through red eyes no jetlag
Geeked off the money this 100k cash
Niggas they be talking but this’ what the K said
Prrt prrt get the picture no Jpeg
My glory, gave everything I had but now what you got for me?
Took the stairs no elevator seen every story
Game enforced it
Just another nigga want the Bentley and the Porsches
Trynna travel overseas fuck it that ain’t work
No tour no bonjour I’m back on the turf
Probation hating a nigga trynna better himself
Baby mama been spiteful ‘cause I never was there
But she the one that took my son but I’m the one that they blame
Know these hoes ain’t playing fair it's all a part of the game
I got a M for dumb shit and not a problem with pain
‘Cause in the end pain came with everything that I gained

[Hook: Tracy T]
Everybody got choices
Want the Bentleys or the Porsches
Be broke or have a fortune
Running from these voices
(Just a product of the [?])
So the game I enforced it
(‘Cause the game I enforced it)
I’m running from these voices
Everybody got choices

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Everybody got choices
Even playing field could've all had Rolls Royces
Diamonds and pearls have more oysters
The money counting scream heard more voices
Plain Jane Patek cost more than that hollow shit you niggas flex (yes!)
I tells you what’s next
Tell you how to dress and wear the cocaine in vests (Woo!)
Nigga grab your vest
Young niggas ain’t playing and they’ aim ain’t the best
That’s what I call Generation X
E-pills or the D get the whole alphabet (Push!)
G63’s we put baby mothers at ease
Drug deala-drug deala-drug dealer disease
Addicted to the money like the air that I breathe

[Hook: Tracy T]
Everybody got choices
Want the Bentleys or the Porsches
Be broke or have a fortune
Running from these voices
(Just a product of the [?])
So the game I enforced it
(‘Cause the game I enforced it)
I’m running from these voices
Everybody got choices

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
10 commandments on these 36 ounces
Real life I got 36 houses (next move)
To the mansion in the mountains (boss)
Couple ice Mountain Dew and them bouncers
All black when I deal with these accountants
Off balance then you fuck with my allowance
All facts get you whacked for a thousand
The bottles all black stacks on the couches (boss)
Fi-fi-five hundred for the drive-by
On the plug with in a motherfucking live wire (Raaaa!)
You come and take me from the sideline
Condo right next to Lady Gaga's
Branzino on a grill
Sip syrup spending millions on the pills
And the city know he handles his
ATL my first trap was in Mechanicville

[Hook: Tracy T]
Everybody got choices
Want the Bentleys or the Porsches
Be broke or have a fortune
Running from these voices
(Just a product of the [?])
So the game I enforced it
(‘Cause the game I enforced it)
I’m running from these voices
Everybody got choices
