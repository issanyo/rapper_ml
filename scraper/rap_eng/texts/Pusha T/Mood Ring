[Part I]

[Chorus: Reese LAFLARE]
They tell me slow down, I'm livin' fast
We gon' light up the town, like it's burnin' down
Don't go so fast, slow it down
My slow jam might slow dance
Do the right motions
Do the right motions for me
That's the right motion
That's the right motion for me
(That's the right motion for me)

[Verse 1: Reese LAFLARE]
Feelin' so dynamite
JJ, good times
Goin' up sky high
Young nigga blowin' up
Tell 'em check the photo of me
I look like a lotta money
Clown niggas that's lotta funny
I got lotta situations ridin' on me
Cuttin' clocks, gotta take the timer for me
Blow 'em right past, speedin' fast on the gas [?]
People who sleepin' under, who thought I said man down?
That's how my ways move, they got me in my mood, it's emotion
For the loadin'

[Chorus: Reese LAFLARE]
They tell me slow down, I'm livin' fast
We gon' light up the town, like it's burnin' down
Don't go so fast, slow it down
My slow jam might slow dance
Do the right motions
Do the right motions for me
That's the right motion
That's the right motion for me

[Part II]

[Verse 2: Reese LAFLARE]
Today I feel like I wanna ball, stun this shit on you fuck niggas
There, I feel everyday
Mood ring on you fuck niggas
Draco on all of my hittas
Y'all playin' Russian Roulette with a bunch of unstable young nigga
Fuck how you feel
Ayy, count up the cheerio my nigga
Uh, run up that band eight figures
Ayy, just bought an old-school 850
Ayy, they money dictate how I'm feelin'
Ayy, original set just like Wesby
Badass just like Boosie, I'm with the extras
Nigga be doin' all that hatin'
They cappin' lke we don't move 'round in this beat like John Wayne
Two breads like I'm Pootie Tang
They hate me 'cause my skin is black
Fuck 12, we need to attack
They ride with it right on they lap
The lastest bitch right on my lap
Got a whole gang of baddies
And she just pour one out the batch
Flare, I am the truth and the facts

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Mood swings like a mood ring
What color is you?
*sniffs*
Lil Skate, remind me of P little bit
Real shit, fear no nigga
New generation, weirdo niggas, woo
Who clanted you niggas? Mike Tirico and you niggas
Catch air my nigga, I will blow a flare over there
And it's open air, Brooke Market
I'm the socket nigga, plug you in
Smell the fumes in my drug bin
PQT's been dug in
Time for the Sherlin
You can't afford this whirlwind
Call us up in Berlin
Piracy is Merlin, yah
