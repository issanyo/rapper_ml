[Verse 1: Sterling Simms]
The tears have multiplied
Sunny-side up, shit, my brain fried
My reality is your favorite lie
I should have known the first time you gave me some thighs
But I was diggin' my heart a six-foot hole
And you was gon' put the dirt back on
I shoulda never called and left you alone
But my mama raised me better than that, fuck you
And now I

[Hook: Sterling Simms]
Can't believe you are who you say you are, no
Cause I know love when I see that motherfucker, baby
And now I'm drinkin' gin behind the wheel of my car
Cause I know love when I see that bitch, woah

[Verse 2: Sterling Simms]
Tears don't buy
I gotta keep a smile just to hide my cry
Sometimes I will call you a bitch
Yeah I know it's disrespectful and all that shit
But you gotta understand what you did to my heart
The first one to open it then break it apart
Girl I was at the finish line, even that start
Yet you was in the third lane but had me in park
When I was trying to go somewhere with you
But we would end up right back
And I wanted to be somethin' to you
But now I'm back in my bag, baby, baby
Baby I wanna leave cause I can't
Stay right here, baby won't you tell me
Woah, say tell me what it is, tell me what it is
I just

[Hook: Sterling Simms]
Can't believe you are who you say you are, no
Cause I know love when I see that motherfucker, baby
And now I'm drinkin' gin behind the wheel of my car
Cause I know love when I see that bitch, woah

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
You say I treat home, like a pit stop
Like I'm Stevie J, love and hip-hop
We got a love-hate, sometimes we flip-flop
Moved you to the sticks, it lets me dips out
As I make mine, you thinkin' it's play time
Chokin' on what you heard through the grapevine
Them bitches in your head, when I ain't in your bed
Like Momma D pointed out, I was left for dead
Now I'm movin' on, where I do belong
And I found a new arm to hang them Lou' Vuittons
EGHHK!, damn Cupid missed
Guess I'll know love when I see that bitch (Woo!)
I just

[Hook: Sterling Simms]
Can't believe you are who you say you are, no
Cause I know love when I see that motherfucker, baby
And now I'm drinkin' gin behind the wheel of my car
Cause I know love when I see that bitch, woah

[Outro: Sterling Slimms]
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, damn
Ain't no sunshine when the pussy's gone
And you can't go cryin', you gotta chalk it up
My nigga Flippa, it's time to roll up
Cause I'm just out here crazy, missin' her love
