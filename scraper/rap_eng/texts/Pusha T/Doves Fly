[Verse 1: Fred The Godson]
Free Mo, Feds had to free Jason
Early 90's, uncle free basin'
Mid 90's, Pippen had to beat Mason
The bricks was fire, color Sanaa Lathan
And now we applied the supply, fiends tired of waitin'
Anything 8 and up, have 'em wide awaken
Think to take the cut wonder what the buyer's makin'
Tank top, one bedroom, the pies is bakin'
I'm sittin' here waitin', the soda wet
Cocaine cowboy, Aikman, Novacek (woo!)
I'm on a strip while he cook a ki
I load up half of the clips, what up Pusha T (what up Pusha?)
Tell Malice I got that Khaled: the best
Send the fiend to the moon, Alice
I'm movin' that Ralph Cramden
Raise the price of the grams then, shit

[Chorus: Fred The Godson]
Shit, maybe I'm just like my pops
Maybe them birds will make it off the block
But, this is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly
Maybe I'm just like my mother
Maybe I'll make it with the butter, I'm from the gutter
This is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Tell 'em rock-a-bye baby like a lullaby
Watch a Prince turn to king like When Doves Cry
Purple Rain almost had me in the mug shot
Purple tops I was sellin' out my drug spot
One stop shop had a special knock knock
We stepped on every square, shit was hop scotch
We was young, we ain't care we make the block hot
The first Benz I ever bought was from a chop shop
Had a different V.I.N., shit was different then
BBS is on a bitch gave it a different spin
Turn 2 in a 5 with a different blend
My Panamanian connect had a different skin, yuugh!
Fast forward to the present day
Money tie hoe down like the Chevrolet
Every block another notch upon my resume
Now I'm gettin' rap money with the better yay

[Chorus: Fred The Godson]
Maybe I'm just like my pops
Maybe them birds will make it off the block
But, this is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly
Maybe I'm just like my mother
Maybe I'll make it with the butter, I'm from the gutter
This is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly

[Verse 3: Fred The Godson]
They came for the candy
That's why I got work in the telly like Jamie and Fancy
Beretta in the leather from Delancey
Connect the city crab fish she put together with some scampi
Some niggas sellin' halves for ten, they can't be
Been on the block way too long, I'm Marcus Camby
Tints on the Camry, headin' to the boondocks
Came a long way from 12-12's in the tube socks
Heard a story about someone starting with 2 rocks
2 years later, he carryin' 22 blocks
I had to stash near the boiler
Night time playin' the moon, a Houston Oiler
I brought the raw to ya
Had this diesel fiend, tying up both of his arms: Ultimate Warrior
My connect's friend get it from the border
They reservoir dogs, I just get end up with the water

[Chorus: Fred The Godson]
Maybe I'm just like my pops
Maybe them birds will make it off the block
But, this is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly
Maybe I'm just like my mother
Maybe I'll make it with butter, I'm from the gutter
This is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly
