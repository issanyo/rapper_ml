[Intro: Tate Kobang]
Is this that 28 shit?
Yeah, ayy, ayy
Ayy! Whole lotta that, that other shit, heh
Gang shit, lotta that, there, ayy
Love
Ooh, ooh, ayy, ayy, brrr!

[Chorus: Tate Kobang]
Extended clip, stick man, Glock 9, glit man
Pour lean, drip, man, drip, man, drip, man
Shawty pop pussy on a handstand, raw shit, lit man
China gang, dip man, dip man, dip man

[Verse 1: Tate Kobang]
All the drugs, kickstand, Rolex, rich man
Shoot shit like Ray Allen, sixth man, sixth man
Shoot shit, hitman, trap shit, brick man
My bitch, she suck dick, but not like your bitch can (Hello?)
Take shots like sip, man, Purple rain like I'm Prince, fam
In the trap, give 'em bargains
Got joggers on, I ain't jogging (Ahh-ahh)
Made a diss song and it cost him
Caught the nigga and we offed him (Ahh-ahh)
Guns and bitches ain't scare us, nigga (Brrrp-brrrp!)
So we use 'em once and we toss 'em (Hello?)

[Chorus: Tate Kobang]
Extended clip, stick man, Glock 9, glit man
Pour lean, drip, man, drip, man, drip, man
Shawty pop pussy on a handstand, raw shit, lit man
China gang, dip man, dip man, dip man
Extended clip, stick man, Glock 9, glit man
Pour lean, drip, man, drip, man, drip, man
Shawty pop pussy on a handstand, raw shit, lit man
China gang, dip man, dip man, dip man

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Price up, seesaw, work out, B-More
My brick, two-six; in the drought, three-four
Run that, Bojack; cars got Lojack
Trap doors, drop floors; black tint, Kodak
New plug, trap phone, trap house, who's home?
Two fiends, one stove, turbo, ozone
Rolex, rainbow, Black face, Django
Shorty, stay low, kilo, they know!

[Chorus: Tate Kobang]
Extended clip, stick man, Glock 9, glit man
Pour lean, drip, man, drip, man, drip, man
Shawty pop pussy on a handstand, raw shit, lit man
China gang, dip man, dip man, dip man
Extended clip, stick man, Glock 9, glit man
Pour lean, drip, man, drip, man, drip, man (Brrrp-brrrp!)
Shawty pop pussy on a handstand, raw shit, lit man
China gang, dip man, dip man, dip man
