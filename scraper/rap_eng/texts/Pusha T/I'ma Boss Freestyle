[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I earned my name just like Marlo
Gripped every wheel at a Flex car show
I declare war, letting all you rappers know
Red light, yellow light, green light, go
Checkered flag shit, matching bag shit
Monaco Grand Prix snap back backwards
Don C joint with the python accents
The bitch still hissing, snake charmers magic
Some shit dont change, ya life ain't like mine
Missin' dope money sends chills up my spine
Closed the motorised blinds
Got a seal and a stamp, papi notarized mines
B.O. double S's, that Camaro ain't mine
That Phantom's double breasted
Got me feeling like Hov in that bubble Lexus
Back when Dame dropped the duffle off with the records
Yes!
