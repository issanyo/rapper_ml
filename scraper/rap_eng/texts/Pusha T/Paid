[Intro: Pusha T]
Yeah, King Push
Uh, Jeremih
You know we all about that money, right?
Well let's get paid

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Paid! Paid!
Tryna get paid
Tryna get paid

[Hook: Jeremih]
You ain't talkin' 'bout the money, what you talkin' bout?
I'm tryna get paid
Fuck what they say
I don't need no faves
All I need is blue faces
Dead presidents, roll the same
Movin' up, George Jefferson
Shoppin' sprees, I know you've never been
All these niggas hate
Had to hit 'em with the wave
First class, talkin' 1A
First class, talkin' 1A

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
New money, uh, blue hunnids, uh
Cold winters, uh, cruel summers, uh
We winners, uh, the crew of us
It's nothin' better than livin' it with your brothers
New wheels on deck, no chill, we flex
New chicks, we sex, who's up? We next
It's a race 'til the finish line
'Til all my dogs eat like it's dinner time
We spend it on light toys, dodgin' them bike boys
Flippin' them pill packs, dodgin' them bike boys
We know the risk and the payoff
You only live once, so we never take a day off
Woo! Chop shops are the small change
Small gun with a long range
With the molly, made our own lane
We just here to get paid, we just tryna get paid

[Hook: Jeremih]
You ain't talkin' 'bout the money, what you talkin' bout?
I'm tryna get paid
Fuck what they say
I don't need no faves
All I need is blue faces
Dead presidents, roll the same
Movin' up, George Jefferson
Shoppin' sprees, I know you've never been
All these niggas hate
Had to hit 'em with the wave
First class, talkin' 1A
First class, talkin' 1A

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Remember sleepin' on the rooftops?
Now what I'm drivin' out, a roof drops
No more skatin' through my tube socks
Young wild niggas like the Boondocks
The treasure's inside of the trunk
Help mama with the first of the month
Baby mama get to buy what she want
Baby sister get to buy the free lunch
It goes down when the poverty's up, woo!
See the difference is, had to get it, no privilege
Had to take it, no middle man
Just divided up the dividends
That's drug dealer discipline, that's how you reel 'em in
Woo! For that almighty dollar
I make the whole gang follow
The only way to pop bottles
You gotta have the money and the power
We just tryna get paid

[Hook: Jeremih]
You ain't talkin' 'bout the money, what you talkin' bout?
I'm tryna get paid
Fuck what they say
I don't need no faves
All I need is blue faces

Shoppin' sprees, I know you've never been
