Mama Mavis, oh
Mama, they tried my patience (x3)

Mama Mavis, oh
Mama, they calling favours

You say I'm dangerous, I speak for the nameless
I fly with the vultures, I be with them bangers
If change don't come, then the change won't come
If the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come

Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?) Look into your eyes
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark, let me out)
You got to die a little if you wanna live (If you wanna live)
Change come to pass
Change come to pass
You'd best be ready for it
Something...

[Beat drop]

Let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all (x4)

Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?) Look into your eyes
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark, let me out)
You got to die a little if you wanna live (If you wanna live)
Change come to pass
Change come to pass
You'd best be ready for it
Something...

[Beat drop]

Be ready (uh-huh, uh-huh), ready for it
Be ready, be ready
Oooh, oooh oooh
(Let me out)
