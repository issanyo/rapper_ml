The only thing missin' is seven dwarves
Funny, Snow White sprinkled all through my repertoire
Pissin' the devil off so much I shovel off
A nigga ice-cold as I'm freezin' my bezel off
They hopin' I level off, escalator-climb on you niggas
I only speak money, I go mime on you niggas
Uh, white gloves and a powdered face
Single-edge razor, Gemstars on powdered plates
The winter coupe hibernates, here's where I dominate
The longest runnin' trap star street niggas nominate over all
All the watches get overhauled
Bitches get over, dog, can't limit the protocol
Don't turn your motors off 'cause niggas' motives are on
They say the snake is the closest, remember to mow the lawn
Rich nigga shit
