[Intro: Ti'Jean]
Fast, Slow
Pusha
Ti'Jean
Lets go

[Hook: Ti’Jean]
Ayo, She's working it fast. Working it slow
Working it like, she’s working the pole
Working it like, she's working for cash
Working it good, Working it oh

She's working it fast, Working it slow
Working it like, she’s working the pole
Working it like, she's working for cash
Working it good, Working it oh

[Verse 1: Ti'Jean]
Feels like I'm God reincarnated, Michelangelo flow
I paint the motion pictures call me Davinci, Leonardo
Blow up your fucking Gallardo
No, I show no "Mercy" to your Murciélago
No, No, I don’t give a shit
Eat it up like soufflé you say, I’m riding with your bitch
Top down like toupee you say, I’m riding with your chick
She say, say “No, Ti’Jean I’m so so ticklish.”
Then she started lick, lick, licking on my dick
I came all up in her mouth, Riding down 95 South
She was working the stick shift, and I’m trying to turn her out
Working her hands on the steering wheel
Circular motion, ferris wheel, Say my name, How’s it feel?
“Ti’Jean you so fuckin’ real.”

[Hook: Ti’Jean]
Ayo, She's working it fast, Working it slow
Working it like, she working the pole
Working it like, she’s working for cash
Working it good, Working it oh

She's working it fast, Working it slow
Working it like, she working the pole
Working it like, she's working for cash
Working it good, Working it oh
[X2]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
She was working it fast
Pop it, Lock it, Drop it, She was twerking that ass
Working for a profit, Now I’m up in that ass, She look back to try and watch it
Then I’m up in a flash, Gotta go, I’m bout my cash, Check it
Two doors, With no roof, Barefoot, that’s no shoes
That’s no rims, That’s no Benz, That’s no Jag, That’s Aston, Martin
And I’m parking, Beep my horn as you’re walking
Then I hop out like its high school, bring the drop out and lets slide through
Dope game said “I do.” Life’s a bitch, I said “Mine too.”
Red bone, with green eyes, and fat ass, named “Bayou”
Everything that I buy you, you work for, You twerk for
You drop low, You headstand, You headspin, You earn more
Woo, I ain’t tryna holla at you
Woo, I just wanna throw these dollars at you
Woo, I ain’t nothing like them other rappers
Woo, The only one you should be running after

[Hook: Ti’Jean]
Ayo, She's working it fast, Working it slow
Working it like, she working the pole
Working it like, she's working for cash
Working it good, Working it oh

She's working it fast, Working it slow
Working it like, she working the pole
Working it like, she's working for cash
Working it good, Working it oh
[2x]

[Verse 3: Ti'Jean]
So which one? Pick one, Any position, Call me missionary magician
Fulfilling erotic fantasies, so you can stop wishing
I got your legs shaking and twitching, twerking while you climax
Touching yourself when I rap, spin you around from the back
She getting so wet, She getting so wet, She flooded up the mattress
What is this? Tantric, mind-blowing madness, Explosive sexual experiences
Yes you are the baddest
It feels so good, Feels so good, Its like I never had this
So spectacular, she ridin’ me doing gymnastics splits
Hop up on this magic stick, I can tell you never felt this
All about you, I never quit, All about you, I’m never quick
I wanna lick lick lick you from your head to your toes, so, so, so…

[Hook: Ti’Jean]
Ayo, She's working it fast, Working it slow
Working it like, she working the pole
Working it like, she's working for cash
Working it good, Working it oh

She's working it fast. Working it slow
Working it like she working the pole
Working it like she's working for cash
Working it good. Working it oh
[2x]

[Pusha T:]
It’s as simple as that though you know
It’s either Fast or Slow
It’s whatever you good at though you know
I like both ways baby
King Push
You gon’ earn this motherfuckin’ money though
