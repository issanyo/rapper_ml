[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Come look into the eyes of a man named Gucci (Uh)
Got me peepin' out the blinds like Malcolm with the Uzi (Yea)
The government, the church, and the world is so polluted
They callin' me a criminal when I'm a revolution (Huh)
Woke up in a prison cell and I had a revelation
That my life's a testimony, I could be an inspiration (Yea)
From the 6 to the Chi, got so much in common
Gucci Mane and Common, did you see this comin'? (Go)
Nigga with an attitude, a hundred miles and runnin'
I done did some things so dirty that I wish I never done it (Wow)
All eyes on me, America's most wanted
It's so hard to be a Black man in a white man country (No)
Product of the slums with rich white folks' money (Yea)
And the police got no love for me, but I'm not scared of nothin' (No)
Mass incarcerate us, man and then they call it "justice" (Wha)
"Gucci how you feel?" I'm so tired of the fuck shit (Wop)

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Look me in my face, If you wanna know, yeah, yeah
I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go
Black America, yeah
Black America

[Verse 2: Common]
The Black diaspora
Supreme math into the after
Life, I live it for the master
Truck drivers passed us
Like Jeremiah and Jasper
Children of Zimbabwe and Madagascar
Africa unite, we on the move like runaway slaves through the night
I write, "Freedom ain't far"
My North Star's more than a sports car
Taught by the ancestors who fought for our
Liberation army
Islam palmed me and calmed me
So the world couldn't blond me
Lectures by Kwame Ture
The ambiance of pan-Africanism
A man after wisdom of the ancients
I paint with words like the brushes of Kehinde Wiley
Black and proud, we wild
We wowed the world with Black magnificence
A symphony for the divine
And we the instruments, Black innocence

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Look me in my face, If you wanna know
I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go
Black America, yeah
Black America

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I confess, I've been part of the problem
As of lately, I'm tryin' to solve 'em
I sold dope and I still talk the jargon
Just like Malcolm 'fore the X was on him
All these years later, we still the target
Look at Ferguson, Brooklyn and Charlotte
Sellin' CDs, reachin' for wallets
Trayvon'd be in his last year of college
I still mourn for Christopher Wallace
What happened in Dallas does not give me solace
So I acknowledge my flaws, apolige
Hey young world, just givin' you the knowledge
The knowledge

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Look me in my face, If you wanna know
I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go
Black America, yeah
Black America

[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]
I'll take you there, To get in, oh
Black America
Look me in my face, If you wanna know
I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go
Black America Black America
Black America Black America
Black America, Black America
Black America
