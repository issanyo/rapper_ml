[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Pusha watch ‘em come and go, like intro to outro
That’s why I keep about four
One in the home, one in the hideaway, two in the bed
The don dada way, and by the way, I keep a lot of yay
Love hurts too heavy, so why I prefer plenty instead of a steady
I ain’t built for pain
Much rather buy ya the same Louis Vuitton chiffons
And just charge it to the game, I’m gone

[Verse 2: Eric Benet + (Pharrell)]
Time
I still don't know the reason after all this time
(After all this time)
I'm all alone but see it comes as no surprise
It seems each time I go left, love goes right
(Love go right) Every time (I said every time)

By chance, something happens every time I get a chance
(Get a chance)
I feel the rhythm but I just don't know the dance (Yeah)
I want to move with you but something holds me back
(Something holding him back)
And I'm holding back (Got to hold him back)

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Benet + (Pharrell)]
All I ever needed I could never find
And all I ever wanted was to get it right (Get it right)
Somebody tell me what is wrong with me
I wasn't sure but now I believe
It must be

[Chorus: Eric Benet + (Pharrell)]
Love don't love me (Love don’t love me)
It don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Say it again, love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)

[Verse 3: Eric Benet + (Pharrell)]
Oh why
I know exactly what is missing in my life (In my life)
Something for sure, something pure, maybe a wife (Yeah)
But then I'm out the door before the morning light (Morning light)
And that was every night (Talking every night)

So I pray
I'm so afraid I'm always gonna be this way (Be this way)
Relationships only to pass the time away
Fear of commitment is a habit hard to break (Hard to break)
I must say (Listen, girl)

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Benet + (Pharrell)]
All I ever needed I could never find (I could never find)
And all I ever wanted was to get it right (Get it right)
Somebody tell me what is wrong with me (What’s wrong with me?)
I wasn't sure but now I believe
It must be

[Chorus: Eric Benet + (Pharrell)]
Love don't love me (Love don’t love me)
It don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Say it again, love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)

[Verse 4: Malice]
I love my wife like I love my girlfriends
Keep their head spinning, caught up in my whirlwind
Guess that’s why, love don’t agree with me
‘Cause, see, with me, I need at least two or three with me
Selfish, ain’t it? Helpless and can’t explain it
Temptation come quick when the whip’s candy painted
Love ain’t fair, so I have love affairs
Yeah, I mighta bought ‘em but damn, I can afford ‘em

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Benet + (Pharrell)]
All I ever needed I could never find
And all I ever wanted was to get it right (Get it right)
Somebody tell me what is wrong with me
I wasn't sure but now I believe
It must be

[Chorus: Eric Benet + (Pharrell)]
Love don't love me (Love don’t love me)
It don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Say it again, love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
Love don’t love me (Love don’t love me)
