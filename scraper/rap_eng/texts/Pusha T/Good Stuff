[Intro]
Yeah, I'm telling you boy
You're wasting your time on her
The good stuff's right here

[Verse]
I seen you when you walked in
Stealing all the light
You're the type of guy
That makes them fly girls fuss and fight
They can't love you more
Not the way you're wishing for
They go about it all wrong
Experts get it right

[Refrain]
(Ooh, ooh)
I'm telling you now boy
Put your eyes on me
(Ooh, ooh)
And if you call now boy
I'll throw my heart in free
(Ooh, ooh)
I can love you
In one million ways
(Ooh, ooh)
And if you don't like it
Send it back in thirty days

[Verse]
I know you're sick of them
Knowing who you are
All they wanna do is
Ride around in your fancy car
Gimme this, gimme that
And yeah I know it's so whack
All they wanna do is be seen with a superstar

[Refrain]
(Ooh, ooh)
I'm telling you now boy
Put your eyes on me
(Ooh, ooh)
And if you call now boy
I'll throw my heart in free
(Ooh, ooh)
I can love you
In one million ways
(Ooh, ooh)
And if you don't like it
Send it back in thirty days

[Chorus]
This is the good stuff
This is the good stuff
You don't know this is that good stuff
This is the good stuff

[Verse: Terrar]
Bulletproof under the suit, no need for alarm
The way I flow through the club call me Disco Don
But my name, still Terror, still the world at my palm
You chicken, heat front passenger seat load in my arm
Who she with next?
One of two Clipse intended specs then
Dance floor, hot sex
My hands rubbing her breast
What am I saying baby?
Discotech or discotheque?
Either way to miss my spray just swish your neck

[Verse]
Now that you've seen
You really wanted me
And those girls wasted their time
Thinking they could possibly (yeah right)
You want this you don't want that
Here girls he don't want it back
And if you want the next one
You should repeat after me

[Chorus]
This is the good stuff
This is the good stuff
You don't know this is that good stuff
This is the good stuff

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh)
This is the good stuff
(Ooh, ooh)
(ooh, ooh)
(ooh, ooh)
(ooh, ooh)

[Outro: Terrar]
Yo you looking at stars
Yeah, you know who we are
(You don't know)
Clipse, Kelis, Neptunes
Star Track I'll be back baby

[Outro]
Good stuff
This is the good stuff
This is the good stuff
You don't know this is that good stuff
