[Pusha T]
The best nights are the simplest
Red wine, nude lips and a simple kiss
Yeah, let's test the waters
Love makes a splash
And you too thick to skinny dip
Blinds close as the time goes
The room's pitch black we in a blindfold
That overnight bag
Handy when it's this late
Hit the snooze button
You takin' a sick day

[John West]
Only been like eight days
All I ask is that you'll stay
So many songs you could inspire
Bring strong men to their knees and
This is the summer season
Don't know how I could get much higher

[Hook]
But I gotta tell you
It's alright
Whenever you're near me
I don't need to hide
Yet I'm feelin helpless
I, I don't need it
I feel like I'm in love 'least
That's the way I see it

But it's like
Ooh bada ba badu ba
It's like, it's like
Ooh bada ba badu ba
But we don't need no words
It's like
Ooh bada ba badu ba
Everytime it's just like
Oh whoa oh oh

[John West]
Cause when you look my way I
Don't know what to say I
Haven't felt this in such a long time
You know it
So good when you're beside me
Arms feel right wrapped round my body
Feel like I could be anywhere

[Hook]

[Pusha T]
Yes

Tryin' to get my mind right
Juggling my time right
Weekend getaways
Ducking out the limelight
It's kinda
Hard when you live under the spotlight
Chauffeured
Through the city like it's prom night

I'm the talk you the walk of it
Rumor mill? We the bulk of it
They find fault with it
Haters green like the Hulk with it
Dirty money? Got a vault of it

[Hook]
