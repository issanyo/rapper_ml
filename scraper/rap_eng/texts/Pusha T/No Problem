[Verse 1]
If I am the problem
Then you cannot solve it
You live in the crosshairs
When you are the target
It's hard to stay underground
The brighter your star gets
From sun up to sundown
I'm glowing regardless
We came with the mission
To corner the market
To take it, you gotta be heartless
One of the hardest, ah

[Chorus]
I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh
I get the feeling like I'm high
On my life you ain't gon' want these problems
Take you down ain't gon' be no problem
Watch when you play with God
I got the Tec and the squad coming for you
I got diamonds dancing in my mouth
Think you the king of this house, I'm coming for you
I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh

[Verse 2]
Dead or alive, I'm wanted
Just like a ghost, I'm haunted
I'm callin' the shots, you callin' the cops
The Angel of Death is upon us
It's not a threat, it's a promise
Killing at will if we honest
I tell you, no lie, it's Jekyll and Hyde
When you are like one with the monsters
I am the problem (yugh)
I got the power (yugh)
I got the pull, I run with the bulls
You run with the cowards
This thing of prowess (yes), this thing is ours (yes)
I put out the hit, your funeral's lit
I show up with flowers

[Chorus]
I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh
I get the feeling like I'm high
On my life you ain't gon' want these problems
Take you down ain't gon' be no problem
Watch when you play with God
I got the Tec and the squad coming for you
I got diamonds dancing in my mouth
Think you the king of this house, I'm coming for you
I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh
