[Intro: Ayak]
Ayo! Are you ready?
Me say Pusha T
Me ah gon' conquer them
Me ah gon' come, kill and conquer
Run tune, my lord (Push)

[Intro: Pusha T]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Hold up, this the game, it chose us
Pioneer, started on my corner like the Cold Crush
Had smokers linin' up the block like a gold rush
The sayin' "live fast and die young" is what they told us (me ah gon' murder dem)
The way that they mold us, perfect way that showed us
How to get money, fuck bitches off this nose dust
Showed me how to burn the block down before it slows up
Before the window of opportunity close up (run tune)

[Hook: Pusha T & Ayak]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled (Yuugh!)
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled (Yuugh!)
Yogi said get em so I got 'em all (Yuugh!)
And turned this bitch into a burial
Me ah gon' conquer them
Me ah gon' come, kill and conquer
And turned this bitch into a burial
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled (King Push)
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled (you ready? Then let's go)
And turned this bitch into a burial (hold up)

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Lookin' from the top floor, why would I stop for?
Still hear the crowd cheers, while I'm thinkin' encore
Flyin' on a Concorde, listening to Tom Ford
Frames match the song title, flyer than a Condor
Little niggas rhyme poor, poverty flows in ya
Part of beatin' hoes in, I am who you're tryin' for?
I think not - Pusha, stay hot
The coupe's got no roofs, forever they stay drop, nigga

[Hook: Pusha T & Ayak]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled (Yuugh!)
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled (Yuugh!)
Yogi said get em so I got 'em all (Yuugh!)
And turned this bitch into a burial
Yes
Me ah gon' conquer dem
Me ah gon' come, kill and conquer
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
And turned this bitch into a burial (hold up)

[Bridge: Ayak]
We're going to take everyting, stick up everybody
We have business with a traitor
Dem cyan chat to us, dem cyan see us
Dem cyan say nuttin'
Me ah gon' murder a soundboy
Want me bloodclart money, so run tune

[Outro: Pusha T & Ayak]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
And turned this bitch into a burial
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled (GOOD Music)
Me ah gon' murder dem pussy
Dem cyan chat to us, dem cyan see us
Dem cyan say nuttin'
Me ah gon' conquer dem
Me ah gon' come, kill and conquer
(Hold up)
