[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
If you got a whip outside right now
And you really about that life
Put your keys in the air right now, damn

[Hook]
That Louie and my cologne when I'm riding in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Riding in that Lambo, riding in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Oh my God I'm in this ho
Oh my God I'm in this ho
Oh my God I'm, oh my God I'm
Oh my God I'm in this ho
In this ho, I'm in this ho
That Louie and my cologne when I'm riding in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Woah, I'm pulling up in that shit
Four fifty eight on that bitch
Doors lifting up on that shit
Ho, you see the shit on my wrist
Oh my God I'm in this ho, oh my God I'm in this ho
Yeah I'm fucking that centerfold
Fuck you all in my business for
You ain't talking bout getting dough
You ain't talking bout getting more
Lakers - Heat, camera seats
That's the difference between rich and poor
Recognize I jeopardize that top spot and they testify
They ate first and I'm next in line
We back to back and he pass baton
I put my chest at that finish line
This art money, this Renaissance
My chain heavy, it's winter time
See all colors, this Benetton

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Swizz Beatz]
Vroom, vroom, I ride around like wheels
Swizz, I'm back up on my shit
Haters, got to suck the dick
Ah, y'all can get them clips
I'm riding around in that Countach
Candy paint on that Countach
White seats on that Countach
Have you ever seen a Countach?
Rare form, I'm in rare action
Came back I'm like Michael Jackson
Woo! Michael Jackson
Wait a minute, let me slow it down
For you dumb niggas I'll slow it down
I gets the paper you know it now
I gets the paper you know it now
Damn, damn, I just crashed it
But I'm 'bout to get another one, you little bastards

[Hook]
