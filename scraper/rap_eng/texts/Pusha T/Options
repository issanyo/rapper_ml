[Intro: Pusha T]
Yeah
Moh Flow
King Push
Yugh

[Verse 1: Moh Flow]
I'm driving to your side a bit
You know who I'm riding with
Know I'm always on the road
You give me a private show
I got my thing on cruise control
I'm writing to that new thing you should know
I had it on repeat in your Benz with your friends
'Cause your speakers Bose
Then I pass you the light and it's off you go
Totally different when i see ya face (When I see your face)
You got zero time to waste (Got no time to waste)
I'm on mission I'ma get you lit (I won't be too late)
I need find out how you taste

[Chorus: Moh Flow]
Not to pick and choose, but I want you and I'm on the way
(Riding with the window down, I don't want to talk)
Pull up, then you hop in, get it poppin', over-medicate
(Riding with the window down, I don't want to talk)
It's not only you, girl, I got options, let me set it straight
(Riding with the window down, I don't want to talk)
Not to pick and choose, but I want you and I'm on the way
(Riding with the window down, I don't want to talk)
(Riding with the window down, I don't want to talk, yeah)

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Flow, let's go
I let you pick and choose
It's only the penthouse with views (yuh)
Serving you champagne and flutes
It's only the V12 on coupes (skrt)
You know how I do (woo!)
Buy the watches by the twos
That's for me and you
We show the hood who got the juice
I usually like 'em loose
You know, the fast kind (skr' skr')
Recite all my rap lines
Stick out a hand when it's cash time (Push)
That's my past time on my bad mind, no
If it's the last time, then that's fine, go

[Chorus: Moh Flow]
Not to pick and choose, but I want you and I'm on the way
(Riding with the window down, I don't want to talk)
Pull up, then you hop in, get it poppin', over-medicate
(Riding with the window down, I don't want to talk)
It's not only you, girl, I got options, let me set it straight
(Riding with the window down, I don't want to talk)
Not to pick and choose, but I want you and I'm on the way
(Riding with the window down, I don't want to talk)
(Riding with the window down, I don't want to talk, yeah)
