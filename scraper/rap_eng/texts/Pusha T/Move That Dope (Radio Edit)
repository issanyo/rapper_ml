[Verse 1: Future]
Whippin' the yam, whippin and flippin' the yam
Turn the whole brick to a Lam
Re-rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat
Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Servin' a new Maserati, in a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from the 12
Movin' them squares and them bales, servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up
Made myself a boss, a boss and a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pot in my left
Leanin' over, over to the side, I whip me a four way to a nine
The dirty, the money is homicide
And my recipe can't be televised

[Hook: Future]
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga, young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga, young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope


[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Young enough to still sell dope, but old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better
Get it nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever and flood their Rollie 'till the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues, the J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From sixteen years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, Versace way before Migos
My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my hijos
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side, now nothing's big as my ego, Push

[Hook: Future]
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga, young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga, young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
Me, I try to leave the best for later
But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Gar√ßons and the Buffalo
Young nigga move that dope, boy
P move that ho
When I move that rope, I could move your ho
When she hear the motherfucker know from her throat
When I sing la-la-la, LaFerrari
Red-on-red like the Imperial Army
Mamis, I am sorry, that was just my ego on me, uh
Women's my army, surrounded they always be on me
Just want a piece like they Gandhi
Close my eyes, pray to the omni-nificent
Just to wake up the insomni-niacs
Let me help you lift your shit
Get it right and ignite your shit
See it, build it, sell it, IPO but don't swipe your shit
