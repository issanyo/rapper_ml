[Intro: Trouble]
Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
Fresh, fresh, fresh

[Chorus: Trouble]
Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
I just want to take this time to get a few things off my mind
And to sincerely apologize, now I say "Thank you, Lord"
Yeah, Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
Yeah, Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
I just want to take this time to get a few things off my mind
And to sincerely apologize, now I say "Thank you, Lord"

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Yeah, for helping me make it outta the ghetto, hello
For guidin' me to another level, hello
For the times I had to shake the Devil
You got him up outa me, snatched him off whenever he ride me
You didn't ever lie to me, sendin' me prophecies
Lettin' me know that there wasn't no stoppin' me
Only thing in the world that would probably be
Self destruction, or nothin'
Me treating' my temple as if it was trash
You still never left me just gave me your best
And just for me thinkin' bout it, a tear rolled outta my eyes 'cause I got it bad
You blessed me to reach twenty-five
In a day when we live, fuck twenties, karma's the prize, so man
Mammas from sons, but we live by the gun so you know how that goes
So I roll up thankin' Him for not lettin' my brain get blown

[Chorus: Trouble]
Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
I just want to take this time to get a few things off my mind
And to sincerely apologize, now I say "Thank you, Lord"
Yeah, Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
Yeah, Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
I just want to take this time to get a few things off my mind
And to sincerely apologize, now I say "Thank you, Lord"

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yeah, let me start off by saying "Thank you, Lord"
Shots missed me, they could've waked the morgue
Them niggas vowed that they would never tell it (Tell it)
They got their time and they begin to yell it
Niggas be jealous, them niggas could care less
They'd rather see my fly than walkin' with them felons
I sold powder, shaved doors, you saved my soul
The safe is full, the safety's off, my second home
Whoo, I let these bitches get a hold of me, yeah
These mean streets done took a toll on me, yes
I let this money take control of me
Lord, the only one that didn't fold on me
Push

[Chorus: Trouble]
Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
I just want to take this time to get a few things off my mind
And to sincerely apologize, now I say "Thank you, Lord"
Yeah, Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
Yeah, Just in case I didn't say thank you, Lord
I just want to take this time to get a few things off my mind
And to sincerely apologize, now I say "Thank you, Lord"
