They think that they know
Something 'bout my life
Not in the same class
Not on the same flight

Maybe the same club
Just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch
Just not the same night

You just took her phone number
I just took her home with her

Another bitch
Ménage
Boomerang
Stron'jay

Lipstick on my collar
Oscar de la renta(y)
Yo hijo - pequeño
My nachos - bell grande

Stay sippin' that Andre
Spent 3 stacks - that's Andre

That Balmain
That Phillip Lim
They say i'm dressing like Kanye

I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Breadwinner
Brand owner
Play Cloths
Millionaire
Trendsetter
Landowner

Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small niggas - you Hyundai's
You couch niggas - we stand on him

*#&%#
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold we got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
DAMN!
