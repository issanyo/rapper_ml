[Intro]
Coming live in direct from Abu Dhabi
Recorded in Emirate's palace
I bring to you the Fear of God
Liva Don
Noah on the boards
Steven Victor on the camera
Virgil what up

[Verse]
They say this took confidence, I just call it patience
Cause I had too much pride to take this motherfucking cadence
Knowing the Feds watch me, private paparazzi
Still chasing me for war crimes like a Nazi
Against all odds, see the judge tryna' Pac me
Lucky dice roll got my lawyers screaming, Yahtzee
Who the fuck can stop me run away freight train
Mike Vick's redemption, big doggin like a great dane
12 cylinders 50 grams of willing ya
These rappers get away with pushing these child Illingers
Now it's hard feelings, I just put my ceiling up
Planetarium Push, the I-Max experience
They say I talk coke for 9 years long
That means my rap sheet is more than 9 years strong
You niggas would have thought that I was 9 years gone
But I am still in the mix like 9 ounces and a straw
Nigga get your bag on, bitch get your bag on
Balenciaga Hobo so heavy that you drag home
Yeah, see my verses let you tag along
Swim in the oasis of this drug dealers Babylon
Three bitches, three different flights
Glad it was four sides at that Paul Williams fight
The Wynn, the Bellagio, the Palms three nights
As long as they are separated they are my three blind mice
You can't just rap this, the same mindset
That had me hide it in the mattress, now got me round the atlas
Wish every doughboy could get a fair crack at this
They say when one ends, that begins a new chapter

[Outro]
Can I live
You tell me, can I live
