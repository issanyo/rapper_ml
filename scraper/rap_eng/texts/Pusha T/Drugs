[Hook]
You can come and at least do all my drugs with me
It makes everything feel a lot easier
Everything feels like a lot easier
You can come and at least do all my drugs with me
It makes everything feel like a lot easier
Everything feels a lot easier

[Verse 1: Villz]
And I hope I see you there
The thick chick with the blue hair
Wet chick confuse her
Fuck the drama that's a boost care
Pill chewing
Brain cells we're loosing
Haven't had a good time since
Just wanted to do [?]

[Hook]
You can come and at least do all my drugs with me
It makes everything feel a lot easier
Everything feels like a lot easier
You can come and at least do all my drugs with me
It makes everything feel like a lot easier
Everything feels a lot easier

[Verse 2: Pusha]
We all got vices
First class, fly you in, I can get you higher than
Candlelight dinners out, see you coke diet thin
Date night, late night, Down pilow playflghts
Do you got that lockjaw? She replies, "Great White"
Funny you say "Great White"
Kingpin like Frank White, but they King Push
Future bright as break lights
Break day, break bread
Zombies like we base heads
Layin' in the cloud of smoke
Cock slob, play dead

[Hook]
You can come and at least do all my drugs with me
It makes everything feel a lot easier
Everything feels like a lot easier
You can come and at least do all my drugs with me
It makes everything feel like a lot easier
Everything feels a lot easier

[Verse 3: Villz]
And I hope that this moves her
That I relieved her from the losers
She's always hearing that the truth hurts
From the one's that never knew her
Abusing, [?] common sense
These container blunts and glass jars have no [?]
Just remember you can, can have...

[Hook]
You can come and at least do all my drugs with me
It makes everything feel a lot easier
Everything feels like a lot easier
You can come and at least do all my drugs with me
It makes everything feel like a lot easier
Everything feels a lot easier
