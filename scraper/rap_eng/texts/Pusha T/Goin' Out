I've been on the road
But now I'm back again
And this time
I brought my little friend
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
You mean the most to me in this world
I've been thinking to myself a lot
You probably think it's my girls
But when you got the love
It's not like you ain't calling home
And the conclusion I came to is, baby, I am going
Last night, I thought about if this should end
I should be starting a new life
So tonight, I'm hanging with my girlfriends
And I'm starting a new life
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Ooh, you should think about what you did wrong
If you love me
Ooh, such a pity I had to write this song
Better luck with your next girlfriend
Last night, I thought about if this should end
I should be starting a new life
So tonight, I'm hanging with my girlfriends, we're hanging out
And I'm starting a new life, we're hanging
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Pusha, I'm finally back at you two years later, hiatus was hell
300 K thanks to digital scales
Eggshell whites, had them boys on my tail
The truth out, now you don't have to question what I sell
Far as the fucking flow, I'm the hottest 'round
Tap your girl, Ma, ask her how this sound
Condos, fast cars, that's Miami heat
If you know they just copped Shaq, we got the floor seats
Whachu talkin' 'bout? All that hair and all that wear
BAPE, BBC, Three Dots and all that there
I spent green mayne on that bling chain
Make you scream like the silly nigga from Ying Yang
As God is my witness, my fist does clenched this
Green like fist of big Grinch Stole Christmas
Re-up time and it's the work that we bringing out
Hot off the wire, Faith tell 'em whachu thinking 'bout
Last night, I thought about if this should end
I should be starting a new life
So tonight, I'm hanging with my girlfriends, we're hanging out
And I'm starting a new life, we're hanging
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
