I went ahead and asked God for forgiveness
So now I'm just asking you to listen
I'm living in a World (in a world) where my truth can be my lynching
Last words "fuck you all" feel the ropes tension
I'll never compromise, in it til the powder dries
Best friends drowned in quick sand and help you cowards rise
I floss in they honor, there legacy's in bottles
Make them walk like there 30 years is right around the corner
We was all fucking Shawna, you and E was fucking on her
I was jealous when you both said her mouth was like piranha (woo)
Yeaugh, spend money like we print money
Buck fifty on the car, thats little dick money
The AC is forever broke, thats vent money
Cocaine snowballed from gambling my rent money
Everyday struggle get money, get the crown for
Always thinking big now they praying for my downfall
Say you telling on me
Told them folks bout me
All this coke round me
Like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down
You know that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around
I just bought the house
Put the pent on it
No rent couple can't hundred spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down
You that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around
Got me loooking at the crown from a birdseye view
Cause I hit the ground running from the birds I flew
Now I'm standing at the top from the words I drew
Rap shit'll drive you crazy, it done drove Shine's you
Yeaugh mazel tov, now I'm hotter than a Molotov
Tell Lyor I need a million for my monologues
A small price for my cocaine catalogue
Scout the coupe like a tomohawk
Travelodge stories
I pray that you ignore me
If you can't feel the joy of a hustler in his glory
Hiding money in a wall from the first to third story
ATL, Glenridge, condo's true story (woo)
A man of everything that I say I am
A little better than the fans, hope and pray I am
We the jokers out the deck and just play my hand
Smokers getting stuck and going nuts
Like it's peter pan
Say you telling on me
Told them folks bout me
All this coke round me
Like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down
You know that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around
I just bought the house
Put the pent on it
No rent couple can't hundred spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down
You that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around
