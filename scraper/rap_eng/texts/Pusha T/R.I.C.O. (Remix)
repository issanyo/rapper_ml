[Intro]
Only cause Dre say
Yeah, King Push on the way, yes

[Verse]
I made a million on a corner, sniff
I ain't even had to stand on it
Blue moon, I rides by, yes, but I fronted every gram on it
Real money ain't shy, no lay it out and get a tan on it
They say numbers don't lie, well dope boy, put your bands on it
Bet it nigga, Patek Philippe on you peasant niggas
Commonwealth, got the open foul
I'm the poster child for alleged dealers
These niggas mention my name
With their little rumors and their little jewelers
That's no threat, that's no sweat
My little shooters ride little scooters
Fuck you know about a motorcade full of millionaires
Hole in ones, we're like billionaires
Chain linked, they change colors, I'm Chamillionaire
This is sealskin walls, this is trap door floors
I charted nigga no borders nigga, we above those laws
I'm really running from the R.I.C.O
Yeah, I'm really dodging all them people
Uh huh, I run a marathon on the R.I.C.O
Y'all just waiting on the sequel

[Outro]
King Push on the Pharmacy
Beats One yeah
