[Intro: Pharrell]
Ay, ay, ay
Hah, yeah, haheh, yeah
Hahah, ay, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Haha, oww!

[Hook: Pusha T & Pharrell]
You can find me in the streets, even in a drought
My mattress is full, why shouldn't I be out?
Hey buddy, I'm good (What they tell you?)
I'm good (What they tell you?)
I'm good (What she tell you?) I'm good (What you see?)
Two hundred dollar jeans with my favorite patch
Pullin' up my ride, hell yeah, my rims match
What they tell you?
I'm good (what they tell you?) I'm good (what they tell you?)
I'm good (what she tell you?) I'm good (what you see?)
I'm looking good

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Man I'm killin' it ridin' in that brand new
Swimmin' through the streets lookin' like I'm Shamu
In that big body, with the wet paint
I got some pocket change from selling wet weight
Today is a good day, ice cubes on my chest
Lookin' at my Blackberry, freak hit me on the text
Come and beat it up, I just need a minute
You can carry ya ass, you ain't gotta lay in it (yes!)
Niggas don't like it when you lookin' good
Hate it when you shinin' through the neighborhood
Brand new ride, niggas know the time
Hoes cut they eyes, we call them samurais
(Whaaa!) Fly as I could ever be!
A level of success that you could never see
You jealous mane, we in propellers mane
Think about it, ain't shit you can tell us mane

I’m good? (what that tell ya?) I’m good (what they tell ya?)
I’m good (what she tell ya?) I’m good (what you see?)

[Verse 2: Malice]
Cruisin' on them 22's got me sittin' pretty
You should hear that engine purr, here kitty kitty
Ride through the city, e'erbody know me
And the sun is out, it's like it's shinin on me
Shoutin out the homies as I breeze by
I'm on cloud 9, and I ain't even high
Told my shorty I'll be back and I ain't even lie
Them VVSs be the best that money can buy
I see you flirtin baby, them jeans is painted on her
Mama lookin right, and I don't even want her
No need to take it personal but that's just how it be
No disrespect to you, I'm just enjoyin me
Finally I'm free, all my dues paid
Them yellow diamonds got the charm like it's Minute Maid
And I'm lookin good, and I'm feelin good
Try and stop my shine, I wish a nigga would
