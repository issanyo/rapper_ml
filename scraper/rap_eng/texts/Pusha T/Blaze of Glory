[Intro: Pharrell]
Nigga, put down ya beer and snatch up ya children
A lot of clack up clack up, street clearin'
First the firing then the siren you'll be hearin'
Your man got a few heartbeat lefts they fearin'

[Hook: Pharrell]
It's me or you or them or us
Regardless of what them things gon' bust
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I clear the land, in god we trust, nigga
It's the blaze of glory, the blaze of glory
You come in here for me, nigga it's the blaze of glory
The blaze of glory, the blaze of glory
You come in here for me, nigga it's blaze of glory

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Yuugh! fuck ya crews and who ya choosin'
Critics and news and all their reviews
The watch jewelled and VSS jewels with
Different hues of rogues or blues
The street movement that I move with
Hurries the caine like Miami U
Ya niggas foolin', what you doing
Obviously you ain't got a clue
It's the blaze of glory, I'm killer in the clutch
Like the Lakers' Horry with four seconds left
Rappers can't ignore me, quit steppin' on my heel
You fuckers riding my flow like I'm your trainin' wheels, ugh!
Mind over matter, SL blacker
Sunny days, I minus the thinking cap ROOF!
You niggas fishin', well wishin'
Lotta rhyme but still missin' the vision, it's the blaze of glory

[Hook: Pharrell]

[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]
Sheah, the blaze of glory, rewrite history
Turn pages for me, my story is epic
Hustle in my blood, my story is metric
Bring that O backwards I'm feeling dyslexic
Grew up misdirected, dark complected
Sometimes no electric, it was hectic, it was harsh;
I was awed, I was affected, neglected
At sixteen, I got connected like Tetris
Had the power to zone, turn powder to stone
In any beef, iron drept it, iron tested
Think back, I invested, I assessed it, I reflected
Think back, I was requested by God
I shall lead as I was directed
Demand to be king, I was selected a menacing thing
Defying the odds, defying with arms
A tyrant's evolved, the tyrant is on, so run for ya weapon nigga!

[Hook: Pharrell]

[Verse 3: Malice]
I'm for that hit rich quick shit, for that quick lick
For that quick Vick fucker, I ain't for the bullshit
I ain't for the small talk, strictly bout the ballpark
Figures on my numbers these niggas is all talk
Niggas is missing out on life, I ain't hit him
I ain't sitting round thumb-twiddlin', I ain't wishin'
No one could ever tell the Malicious I ain't livin'
The home town homies hate my name, I ain't tripping
I don't retaliate, I don't hate, I obliv' them
Jesus 'round my neck, I'm a Christian I forgive 'em
I was chosen to hold this throne
I held my own, ever since I held that zone
And served it, from all the days I heard mama's curses
Now I put it in verses, it was worth it
Don't let it hurt kid, push a pack, cook a crack
Whatever be the plate, motherfucker get the bank, uh!
