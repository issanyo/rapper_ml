[Intro]
America's ours, America's ours
America's ours, America's ours
America's ours, America's ours
America's ours, America's ours
America's ours, America's ours
America's ours, America's ours

[Break]
Let's go
Yeah
Yeah

[Bridge]
I've been winning for so long
You've been winning for so long
We've been winning for so long
When it's right, it's no wrong

[Verse]
O-M-G no O-N-E
Fuck with a boy, ain't cold as he
Ain't what they seem, not bold as me
Ain't lived a life as low as me
Oh, please
I don't do the nose bleeds
I just pass 'em those keys
Valet parking, Rolls please
Money is power
Look at the people in power
Funeral flowers
Freedom devour
This is not yours, this is ours

[Chorus]
America's ours
Runs like the towers
We back and we better
We rain like the showers
We're watching you cowards
All of you cowards

[Break]
Yeah
Let's go
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
America's ours
Runs like the towers
We back and we better
We rain like the showers
We're watching you cowards
All of you cowards

[Break]
Yeah
Let's go
Yeah
America's ours

[Outro]
Ours, ours, ours
Ours, ours, ours
America's ours
America's ours
