[Intro: Pusha T & Pharrell]
Gather round!
Miami Vice
All my cocaine dreamers, ya know
Miami Vice
Pusha spit this shit for y'all, here we go

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Youngin', don't make my sails rise (uh!)
I shoot you out ya Chukkas
Pusha hear the whispers of all you motherfuckers
Papa said stay free of them suckers, minus the wicked jumper
Street baller like the Rucker, Skip to My Lou
If you lookin for a couple, roosters in the duffle
Keep the hood screaming Cock-a-Doodle Doo, fuckers
Coke by the ton, rap niggas, I'm the one
With basic rhyme pattern, how the fuck you tryin' to chatter?
ASIC ass rappers, got 'em runnin' for they life
I philosophize about Glocks and Kis
Niggas call me young black Socrates
West Indies bitch drop to knees quick (what?)
With dreams of being a rich man's bitch
Feel sorry for niggas, pull triggas and they shit click
So many bullets jammed in my shit, call me lead-fist
Shake the diamonds out my wrists

[Chorus: Pusha T (Pharrell)]
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
I don't fear Tubbs & Crockett
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Got two hot rocks in my pocket
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Big home, palm trees, and watches
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
My only accomplice is my conscience, uh (Gather round!)

[Verse 2: Malice]
Youngin', learn from me, let's not be at odds
We're more like than not, 2 peas of a pod
Same hustle, 'cept my hustle now flows
I once gave it away, at 30 grams a O
That accounts for all them days in the cold
Feels like kids and cake mix, can't wait to lick the bowl
But it's a bigger picture, homes trust I done seen it
From Frankfurt to Cologne, Oslo to Sweden
From Italy's Milan to the shores of Napoli
Now I consider Ferrari and Salvador Dalis
I'm no longer local, my thoughts are global
That's why I seem distant, son, expand ya vision
Even adored by Norwegian woman
Blonde hair and blue eyes, I'm gettin' back with a vengeance
Whip it like they want me all attached to the kitten
And they wonder in these raps if I'm kiddin', huh

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
I don't fear Tubbs & Crockett
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Got two hot rocks in my pocket
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Big home, palm trees, and watches
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
My only accomplice is my conscience, uh

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
(Miami Vice) Sorry Heavenly Father, once again I hate to bother
It's P the evil creeper send some to the Grim Reaper
Meanwhile, me and my Mrs. like Solomon and Sheba
Sign of the times, her Emilio Pucci sneakers, uh
Ghetto literature, I'd damn near die for Bolivia
It don't take much to get rid of ya, once I send for ya
Better call the minister, yuugh!

[Verse 4: Malice]
I'm sorry, Grandmama, for mistakes I have made
When I aired family business, how you put me in my place
Even my baby mama, I can't look you in the face
'Cause I can't do enough, you a symbol of God's grace
So I place you in the flowerbed, porcelain shower heads
Throughout the house and keep the youngins' mouths fed
And when I'm gone, I hope it is said
I gave structure to the youth by the example I led, uh

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
I don't fear Tubbs & Crockett
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Got two hot rocks in my pocket
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Big home, palm trees, and watches
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
My only accomplice is my conscience, uh
