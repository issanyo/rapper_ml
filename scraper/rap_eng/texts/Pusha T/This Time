[Intro]
This time, this time we can't go home
This time, this time we can't go home
This time, this time we can't go home
This time, this time we can't go

[Break]
This time, this time we can't go home

[Verse: Pusha T]
This time, this time we can't go home
I could hang my hat anywhere
I could start, I could finish here
It's the spark of a millionaire
Remind yourself, it's like magic
It's not average, it's more tragic
More tribal, more savage
In a world where you're surrounded by the plastic
Free your mind and just lose it
No test drive, just do it
This murder is so accidental
Us building is so monumental
Got me in my zone
Had to do my own
That put me in my throne
But this time, this time we can't go home

[Pre-Break]
This time we can't go home
This time we can't go home
This time we can't go home
This time we can't go home
This time we can't go home
This time we can't go home
This time we can't go home

[Break]
This time, this time we can't go
This time, this time we can't go

[Post-Break]
This time we can't go home
This time we can't go home
This time we can't go home
This time, this time we can't go
This time we can't go home
This time, this time we can't go home
This time, this time we can't go home
This time we can't go home
