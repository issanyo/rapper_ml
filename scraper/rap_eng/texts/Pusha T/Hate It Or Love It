[Verse 1: Ab-Liva]
I'm makin' vivid for the tourists
Goin' through my storage
True form Montgomery was hot like Porridge
Circa '89 when that coke money flourished
I had peach fuzz and a snub nosed Taurus
And my Eddie Bauer warrage
Heart full of courage
My past was sordid or should I say lurid
Molded after legends my cousins
Ahkmed hamhocked the sean
Rich said mega even 21st and norris
But and the nines kept the norris
The pea green jacked like a forest
Dud shoes'll crinkle hustle every one of them
My homina her face was all 19th n Cumberland
Regime came tumblin'
JBM fell cats mumblin'
It's never been the same with the jugglin'
Behind kept it crumblin'
Ahkmed passed the streets numbin' them
My brother Has knocked niggas tumblin'

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I was copping from Ian and em'
He was coppin from K and em'
K died Hu came home and started placin em'
Hu died and I can't tell you who is replacin' him
Cause he's still livin' and I ain't tryin' a catch no case with him
Winter we did the numbers
South Beach we did the summers
Fresh outfit with no crisp them hoes come out an front us
Never amongst us might brother them humps up
But don't switch numbers cause who we really want could want us
Hometown bitches made us spring for them tickets
Cause in them same homes we was cooking them pidgeons see
Business was me and T
Ended T and T
She was fuckin' Thurman all the while he was robbin' me
That was my man woulda gave a nigga grams
Wanted to ask why but I never had the chance
Never got the answer
Thurman he died of cancer
I look up at the heavans and tell him 'You still my man cuz"

[Hook: Pusha T]
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And we gon' shine nigga until our heart stop
Nigga envy we, it's the R-E-U-P
And we ain't goin' nowhere so you should get to know we

[Verse 3: Sandman]

[Verse 4: Malice]
Y'all niggas can hate it or love it
I ain't done shit cept try an raise y'all above it
Did my part and helped VA get discovered
And I can't get a thank you or think nothin' of it
Look here kinfolk I'll listen to your demo
But do yourself a favor; don't run up to my window
The repercussions are tenfold
So unforgiving and oh so sinful
My forte involve kitchen utensils
My come up got niggas so resentful
All the while eluding Tubbs and Crocket
Came out the game unscathed never the name on the docket
It's only logic I'm only bout the profit
In that two seater so while y'all bout to cop it
I'm already leanin' with the crib and them two kids that give life meanin
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And we gon' shine nigga until our heart stop
