[Verse 1: Sia]
All smiles, I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'll tell you what you wanna hear
Leave my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am

[Chorus: Sia]
I'm unstoppable
I'm a racecar with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm unstoppable until you look the other way
Look the other way, look the other way
Look the other way, until you look the other way

[Verse 2: Sia]
Break down, only alone I will cry out now
You’ll never see what’s hiding out
Hiding out deep down, yeah, yeah
I know, I’ve heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I’m too afraid now, yeah, yeah


[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am

[Chorus: Sia]
I'm unstoppable
I'm a racecar with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm unstoppable until you look the other way
Look the other way, look the other way
Look the other way, until you look the other way

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Pretty isn't perfect, they told me I was worthless
Had to dig deeper with my cleats at the surface
Way more than physical, this is soul-searching
Pain from the pressure to perform equals purpose
No sympathy, nervous energy
Second place, one second don't remember me
I'm not stopping 'til the end
Got the sun on my face and my back is to the wind, yeah
What don't kill you only makes you stronger, yes
The road to glory takes a little longer, yes
What don't kill you only makes you stronger, yes
I got the will to go a little longer
I got the will to go a little longer

[Outro: Sia]
I'm unstoppable and I'm invincible
