Back to the daylight
Everybody's all right
Don't let it stop, don't let it stop
D-don't let it stop 'till we make it to the daylight

Back to the daylight, daylight
Don't let it stop, don't let it stop

Turn it up!
Turn it up!
Harder!
Harder!
T-turn it up, t-t-t-t-turn it up
T-turn it up, t-t-t-t-turn it up

Mecha Doodle, Mecha Doodle-Doodle
Bass drop!

Everybody listen to me
On the count of three
We gon' go all together
Right here, right now
One, two, three, everybody just
Everybody just
Everybody just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
J-j-just bounce

All the ladies, put your hands in the air
Say we don't care
(We don't care!)

All the fellas, put your hands in the air
Say we don't care
(We don't care!)

Everybody, put your hands in the air
It's fresh, it's new
Kill the Noise, go!

(C'mon, c'mon)

Back to the daylight
Everybody's all right
Don't let it stop, don't let it stop
D-don't let it stop 'till we make it to the daylight

Take it to the daylight!
Take it to the daylight!
Take it to the daylight!
Take it to the daylight!
Everybody all right
Everybody all right
Everybody all right
Everybody all right
