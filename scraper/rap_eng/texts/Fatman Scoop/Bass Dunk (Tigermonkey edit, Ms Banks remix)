Bass Dunk

[Charlotte Devaney]
I'm gonna get you drunk, drunk on my bass dunk
Gonna get you drunk, drunk on my bass dunk
I'm gonna get you drunk, drunk on my bass dunk
Gonna get you drunk, drunk on my bass dunk

[Ms Banks]
It's your girl Ms Banks
REMIX

[Charotte Devaney]
Flippin' up the bass
Flippin' up the bass
Rip the bass

[Ms Banks]
(woop, lets go)

That new girl from South you heard about
All these n*gga sweatin' me you should throw in the towel
Kill it is just physics, you know my style
Running their mouth but really they ain't got no clout
I'm on a clean diet no chicken and chips
Swag on sick, brand new bag on my hip
Jobs worth little bitch you should give me a tip
Give me half a mill, I can make that flip
Exquisite, Juicy Fruity I know that you'll lick it
She can't afford my shades she try lick it
Always on point like a white fence, Picket
Piss 'em all off like they just got a ticket
Gonna get you drunk on my lady lumps, humps
What do you do with all that junk in you trunk

[Charlotte Devaney]
I'm gonna get you drunk, drunk on my bass dunk
Gonna get you drunk, drunk on my bass dunk
I'm gonna get you drunk, drunk on my bass dunk
Gonna get you drunk, drunk on my bass dunk
