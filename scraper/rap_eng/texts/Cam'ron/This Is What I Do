[Intro: Cam'ron]
Yeah, Killa
What we getting ready to do is separate the men from the mice
The pit from the poddles, the villains from the heroes, huh
Dipset bitch
You know what that means?
You're amongst the Diplomatic Community
This my man Hell Rell, he locked up, he about to come home
Hit 'em Rell

[Verse 1: Hell Rell]
By the time this shit touch the streets
I'll probably be shackled up, on a bus with beast
But I'mma ride anyway, get high anyway
And let my VVS jewels blind your eyes anyway, fucka
You wanna be gangstas, listen to me
After two years teaching, you'll get your degree
I took over blocks, and put dope and coke on it
Send niggas out, and put 'em under my deodorant
Just like my Speed Stick nigga, I see chips quicker
So hot tomorrow, I'm dropping the remix, nigga
And yeah your top on your 6, go 'head and drop that
Just make your waves more easier to get popped at, nigga
Roll the haze, let's get higher and higher
Picture you selling me coke, I supply your supplier
They asking about the flow, yeah, it's fire, it's fire
Y'all snitch niggas, y'all was hired to be wired
And that's my word fam, I swore to my mother I'd get you
Made a phone call, now I'm done with the issue
Now, all my guerillas gon' come through and get you
And merk off from the double-nickel the color of pickles
I got a serious pimp game, I rock a sick chain
Tote a two-tone ruger and roll with the Dip Gang
Y'all the type of niggas that run from the rumble
Holla if y'all want birds I could front you a couple, nigga

[Chorus: Hell Rell (Cam'ron)]
I stack chips, this is what I do (what he does)
Run through divas, give 'em to my crew (to his crew)
Send work out of town, this is what I do (what he does)
Be with my niggas, this is what I do (what he does)
I stack chips, this is what I do (what he does)
Run through divas, give 'em to my crew nigga (to his crew)
Send work out of town, this is what I do nigga (what he does)
I'm 'bout my paper, this is what I do (what he does)

[Verse 2: Hell Rell]
Shorty thought I had plans of spousing her
I just wanted to have sex on the couch with her
Do it in the mouth with her
Give her a few bricks, make her take 'em down south with her
I'm about my scrilla, come fuck with your nigga
And, all these haters wanna bust at your nigga
And try to do me, so I rock the Uzi under the Coogi
This shit you gon' feel in your bones
They ask if I'm down with the ROC, cause I be with Killa and Jones
I just put rocks on the block, and rock rocks on my wrist
Get your hardest nigga, he ain't poppin like this
Anybody I'm tossing, nigga this is hungry season
We stopped flossing
You and your mans is getting it, where's our portion?
Yo Killa, only reason they killers
When they bust in they hoes, they make her get abortions
Smoke 'dro, flow awesome
I got two guns, you got two guns, let's have a foursome
See I start a riot in a minute, supply it if you sniff it
I'm giving out samples, go 'head, try it, it's terrific
The crack heads love me, female ones hug me, kiss me
Buy the whole pack with crumbled up 50s
Don't cop from that nigga Rell is what you tell the fiends
We getting all the money cause the dimes look like Jellybeans
Few blocks and a lock and key, but I need the world
So it's time to lay my pressure game down like Preacher Earl
Everybody pay up or gon' get sprayed up
This year, I'm get my name back, and my weight up
Go see Premo, razor blade the plate up
Make some packs, hit some workers, sit back and cake up
This is what I do

[Chorus: Hell Rell (Cam'ron)]
I stack chips, this is what I do (what he does)
Run through divas, give 'em to my crew (to his crew)
Send work out of town, this is what I do (what he does)
Be with my niggas, this is what I do (what he does)
I stack chips, this is what I do (what he does)
Run through divas, give 'em to my crew nigga (to his crew)
Send work out of town, this is what I do nigga (what he does)
I'm 'bout my paper, this is what I do (what he does)

[Outro: Cam'ron]
This is what he does, Killa
Santana, Jim Jones, Freekey
Tito in here tonight
Whole Taliban
Brazi, 45th Side
Diplomats man
You see what we do man, this is not a motherfucking joke
Holla at your boy
That's seven digit cake, man
