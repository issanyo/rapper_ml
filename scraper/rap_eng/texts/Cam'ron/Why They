See you lucky man... you lucky to be around me nigga
You better take on the oxygen you suckin' all the H2O nigga
My new name is motherfuckin' Velcro
The way niggas stick to me, no homo

[Verse 1]
Harlem 100 million dollars lovely dame and big
Shots to like wayne and biggs
No need explain ya dig
Someone come claim this kid
He a fraud, the city morgue, gon' claim his wig
Wanna be famous? Well the game is rigged, this is Harlem
Where we scramble crack, beef come handle that
Melt them down to candle wax, pump water we camel backs
Not camel toes, sandal cats can't do jack
Place a order well cancel that Jaffe set it
Any problems baby, come to Harlem baby
We drive several coupes, gray orange cherry coupes
Girls ball like Cheryl swoopes, dudes hustle on every stoop
Your Jimmy Choo, the beef and brocs ma are very cute
I'm like a can of Campbell's bitch, yeah I'm very soup
Look the kid done rose, from sleepin' with roaches
In my nostrils, pick my nose, damn mice bit my toes
We slingin' keep ya ratchet bang it don't forget ya codes
Lived in 56 and 46 live my crows
My grandmother fought they grandmother Mrs. Rose
Uncle came down, gat explode, that case disclose
Cause we'll damage ya, amateurs don't play with pros
They compose, nice girls they get turned to naked hoes
They wanna get the boy, hand cuff wrist the boy
Cause I'm the cookie monster, yep Chips Ahoy!
Ahoy from over seas they ship the toys

[Verse 2]
See my mind designa dump, pump when I find the pump
I'ma lift him ten feet she said he ain't tryna duck
Do like my hair cut, line 'em up I lay 'em down
Sign 'em up, I swear to God garbage bags in line and drunk
I keep loaded guns, for every five bricks
My connect throw me one, you don't know me son
Like I love rhymin', I'm just a thug shinin'
And leave the club blinded by the damn blood diamond
(Not Leonardo...) I hug the block
It hug me back, yeah trust I'm grindin'
I told my watch, now look at my watch love my timin'
Name stop, drop it, dog you not poppin'
When I'ma stop frontin', when ya mom stop coppin'
Shit you not rockin', stop watchin', Glock cocked
Dots shots in, call 'em re-run, he pop lockin'
When I stop his heart with some head shots
Better yet he Barney Rubble, he in Bedrock
Yeah you know we dead, when the grass is green
And the suits is black, and the roses red
That's the kiss of death baby boy go to bed
And I don't kiss ma, I know ya head so go ahead
I start wildin' on you, I tell you it won't be polite
You mad I'm stylin' on you, duck down, weave the right
Pull the gat out, two shots, peace goodnight

[Hook 2]
