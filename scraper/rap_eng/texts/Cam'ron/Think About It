[Intro]
Nobody talkin' to nobody no more, that's the problem man
Everybody runnin' around, do what they want do
Til two in they ass, no homo

[Verse 1]
Uhh, no degree, but I got knowledge of self
I, polish my style, lace my wallets with wealth
Now I acknowledge my health
In the mirror I just smile at myself (damn!)
You think you fly? Feel like a pilot myself
Violence - I move in silence, I announce it as stealth
Four pound to the bouncer, try pronouncin' my belt
Pounds - half a pound, kilos, ounces I dealt
Heat, you clowns would just melt
Beat niggas down, give 'em welts
The streets is fucked up, government givin' no help
They get high off the water, niggas livin' like Phelps
My block, had millimeters, hollow points was the finest
A better word to define us, the 140th niners (word)
Why? Nine 9's, 9 to 9
We ain't care if you was deaf, dumb, stupid or blind
Stoop to stoop with them dimes
Recruit the youth losin' they mind
Build a bomb, put 'em on
Yeah, coupe to coupe when we shine, shine

[Interlude]
Nah mean?
Ain't no chorus on this man
Just roll one up and think about it man
I don't sell wolf tickets
I don't tell you no lies, I don't sell dreams man
Think about it
Don't sell yourself short neither
If you're easy to get you're easy to for-get
Remember that

[Verse 2]
Man listen, you'll be John Doe, I run with some no namers
Never met celebrity
Don't even wanna know famous (they ain't with it)
I call 'em my disclaimers that tote stainless
5th bangers from La Havana, no inglés (español)
What you want baby? E, Molly, or nose English?
She said "number 3", oh, you feelin' cocaineish
Turn fiend, b-ball rapper or a dope singer
In an alley self abortin' with a coat hanger
To this environment, understand that I'm no stranger
Mo' money, mo' homicide, mo' danger
The love is fake, the hate is real, and yo' anger
Gon' leave him with broke fingers, believe me, he's no gangsta
I come from poverty, for that coke, ma was starvin' me
Curvin' me for that Ramen need fronto leaf for this harmony
Long nights, long johns while armed for the robbery
A life of crime, this life of mine I swear I need a warranty

[Outro]
Just let that joint ride out man
And I just smoked 8 blunts, I'm high man
Shit fade out
