Yo, all around I rip this

The song had to clip it

The cats in the street, nearly killing over snippets

Birds out to feed 'em bread, so he can eat her head

I'm almost 21, but I still pee in the bed

Had to flead the FED's, all be trife

And I got a crush on Edith (who, Archie's wife!)

Yo not Monaghomy, pornograhy

On the outside, lookin' apauled you see

Tell my girls, I really like photography

On snap shots naked, the wildest boys

First night, head whop, and our salads tossed

While you in a mean neon, I'm with Celine Dion

Throw her in the bed, she the next one I pee on

Say what bitch

Fuck ya'll, niggas get hurt

You know I rock a Soul Train wit' a Cam'Ron's shirt

Doin' cartwheels, all my niggas got Hot Wheels

You a double A-are god, the bluntiest

You know we throw away, blunts for my niggas that's dead

Pour a Law Liqour, drink a long ligga

Then again I never beat, for my nigga Digga

You know I got, navigators, so we won't get lost

N-O-are-E eatin', these Queens niggas call me the Force

At the airainment, Thugged Out

Untertainment, throw around and fuck 'em if the judge say shit

And I - get - what - niggas face it

[Charli Baltimore]

Fools ain't ever know, the ghetto's be the baddest click

Charli's Angels, tangle with Devil's - Advocate

Hoes mad cause our pussy's got the fattest clits

It's estatic shit, how we gon' have a bitch

Under pressure, the Un undress her

That's a tester, that's just the best flirt, to the best skirt

Ever make it to networks

Like N.B.C., N.O.R.E., be 'More and Cam'Ron

Anything we put our hands on, soak up like a tampon, plan on

For puttin' out the hottest LP's

Since - shiiit yo, you gon' have to tell me

Cause this is hip hop, meneaja twat

And ya'll jealous cause what I'm fuckin' wit' the two hottest

Underground fellas, what!

[Cam'Ron]

Yo, all on the ballers shit

Head is what we all could get, biggest to the smallest dick

She gon' swallow all of it

Harlem gon' have a ball with that

After I get her pregnant, yo we goin' to the mall with it

[Noreaga]

Yeah nigga, you know the lie, fuck that bitch

The only reason I don't kiss her, is cause she sucked his dick

Yo I don't even try ta, us up bro

Fuck dat hoe

Pussy stinkin' anyway, let her go

[Charli Baltimore]

Yo ya'll niggas stay fuckin' with them grimmy chicks

On the real though, I wonder where ya'll find these chicks

The rest is evident, I'm the type to split on niggas

But if they right, I'll fuck around and spit on niggas

And if they into that hot shit, I'll let 'em hit my spot quick

But first they gotta pop shit

If not then they gettin' drop kicked

And I like 'em all, Black Jack ya'll

Near 21, all others gettin' cut cut

So be it, you see me!
