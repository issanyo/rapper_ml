Genius and MTV have teamed up to bring you a new look into New York hip hop from ‘97 to ‘98. MTV has dug deep into their vaults and found three gems, each never before seen in its entirety. As part of an ongoing project, MTV is looking to the Genius community to add context and personal stories to these interviews with some of the all time greats.

Here we have the third release in the collaboration between Genius and MTV.  Sitting down for his first solo interview with MTV in 1998, we see a very green Cam’Ron at the onset of his mainstream career.  It’s  a rare look at Cam before he emerged as a flamboyant fixture in the New York rap scene, and a testament to his drive for success.
