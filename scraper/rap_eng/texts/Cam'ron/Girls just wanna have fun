P.e wit her, wee wee, eazy, ol me, ol g little me lick her
So she need liquor never seem sicker, nigga, rap as fast

Had her alley to alley, hawai and maui, and cali the valley
Up in white lotus dog you might notice

And hope is hopeless, dissapaer in the air hocus pocus

[Chorus]

Where you goin, im flowin, she blowin, shy high like a bowing

[Chorus]

[verse 3]
Females better twirl off yours, better curl off yours
Cause i swirl off shores (then what) come back to a pearl golf course (who you)
Im parock, cause girls are hoars, and the world is yours, honey sim sim with a pearl off cours
And you know im in the buildin mister, wit the olsen twins, or the hilton sisters
And i haul em in to the hiltons mister
I milked them, i killed them, you quilt them, you missed her (missed her)
You helped her, you kissed her
You felt all the blisters, melt on your whiskers

[Chorus 2x]
