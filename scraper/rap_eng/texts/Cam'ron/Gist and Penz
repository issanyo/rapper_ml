[Chorus: Phil Collins sample]
While I sit here trying to move you anyway I can
Someone's son lies dead in a gutter somewhere
While I sit here trying to think of things to say
Someone lies bleeding in a field somewhere

[Verse 1: Tom Gist]
Tom, Gist, yeah
See I seen too many dark days
So ya boy need change like an arcade
Mom prayed but, that ain't get the cans open
I was hungry, she was there with her hands folded
Can't focus, thinking of a better day
And drug dealers, they never ask for resumes
My father said, "Son, you need to educate" (educate)
And Rob said, music was a better way
I've been lead astray, you tell me
How to fix, when I stay on that shit like LT
I should just sell E, I can get a fair price
Fucked up, word to life, I can't even spare advice
Nah, I ain't got it, if I did I couldn't give it
I could leave life and not even miss it
I can't kick it or chill, fitting the bill
I'm ducking the charges
Without a canvas or a paintbrush, it's hard for an artist
I gave faith up, I'm trying to get this cake up
I'm authentic, y'all can keep the make up
Just gimme a shot, I got a beginning, I'm writing the plot
My life is a movie, I can't even watch
I'm right back to the block
Back to the struggle, this shit don't stop
You niggas ask me when my shit gon' drop, like they gon' cop
Not even, shit, it gets no clearer
Fight with shame, it's hard for me to look in the mirror
It's my pain, man

[Chorus: Phil Collins sample]
While I sit here trying to move you anyway I can
Someone's son lies dead in a gutter somewhere
While I sit here trying to think of things to say
But I can't take it anymore

[Verse 2: Penz]
