[Cam'Ron]
Dipseeeet!, Killa, In the buildin, Wanna welcome y'all back
Diplomatic Immunity Vol. 2
You know alot of shit been goin' on
Lot'a niggas in Harlem runnin' snitchin' but I'll holla..
Nah mean...Wit all that bein' said I wanna give a shot out to all my partners
Koch Records, Roc-A-Fella Records
And my muthafuckin' niggas down in sizzurp
Know we done smashed the whole muthafuckin' liquor game...I'll holla
Dipset all day long, go get Jim Jones album in stores now
Freeky Zeeky hold ya head, you already know what it is
Sarge hold ya head, Purple Haze will be out this December 7th
Sorry for the delay, but its business never personal
New people, new money, I had to get that check
So with that being said, the team looking right
And look like we ready to go, its all solidified
Jim Jones, Rider of Riders, Santana, Human crack in the flesh
My nigga Hell Rell is home, I jus' brought my niggas S.A.S over from London
40 Cal., Jha Jha what up ma, I got Miami in the house
And the Writer of Writers, J.R

[Verse 1 - J.R. Writer]
YO, I'm jus' miraculous, accurate, gots ta have it
The master, jus so I can laugh at it, show you jus how a savage get
{talkin} - Lets get this shit started man, (uh), J.R. Writer I'm in the buildin'
YO, yo yo, From the baggage to baggages
Shook them baggages had 'em lit
To me passin them half a bricks
Out the back of the Acura whip (whoo)
{talkin} Uh, I'm jus gettin warmed up, let's warm up, I'm still in my warm up suit y'all
YO, that's how I had it locked
Through the bags on the baddest block
Newest Jag wen I pass the cops
Who's as bad as a savage, I (I)
You niggas brag alot, talkin bout you brought raw
You'se a ball hog you ain't never passed the +ROC+
I still dip and dab,stick my hand in bigger bags
Link a gram or give 'em slabs, trips wit tan in gypsy cabs (outta tan)
I be badder than Krueger, speedin' rapid confuse ya
Keys backin' from Cuba, Tea bags for the users
Relax you're a loser, ease back or get fuller
These cats out the tula, Lean back in Madulla
V's matchin' my mula, sleeves actually cooler
Wrists look like I been playin freeze tag wit the Jeweler
So I'm extra good, runnin' through this reckless hood
I floor, slide off, never would these hefers could
Til' they seen me stun harder then I ever should
Now woody ain't the only bird peckin wood

This is how we roll (roll)
This is how we flow (flow)
Can they stop us no
Dipset stop and go
Whoa (whoa), no (no), we don't stop we go!

[Verse 2 - J.R. Writer]
YO, it's a miracle snakes, how I skip through the states
And the crispiest Apes, all my whips up to date
See this pistol and 8, It'll sit you is space
You won't be able to sleep when I get you a wake
That's a funeral, holla, get a funeral, holla
Necessary you'll get pretty at the funeral parlor
Roses, Dandelions send a few to yo father
We manuever for dollas, in the newest impalas
Listen beat it I'm hot every season I rock
Chinchilla filler, leave you niggas to freeze on ya block
We don't believe that you pop, I'll put this eagle to pop
You'd rather cop the plea and go plead to the cops
And say shit like J, I don't need to be locked
The year, the week or a day, I got a seed on the way
{talkin'} What?, Stop cryin' now, Let's keep it movin'
Sissy I'll let a rattle clap, 60 up in this bastards cap
Dig me I'm what you rappers lack, sicker than all your battle raps
Slither up in the asta hatch, or watch young move
On junk food, Twinkies sit on the caddilac
Shit I go Glock for Glock, let's see you dodge a shot
I get the hotties hot, just off my rocky rocks
Them make the goggles drop
Tyra Banks find the top models, shit I'm lookin' for the models top

This is how we roll (roll)
This is how we flow (flow)
Can they stop us no
Dipset stop and go
Whoa (whoa), no (no), we don't stop we go!

[Verse 3 - Killa Cam]
Dipseeeet
Y'all niggas is feeble born, feinds I keep the heaters on
You get the easle drawn, gettin' ya legal on
Chico, Glock cocked, pop goes the weasel's gone
Desert on my waist I get my eagle on
Padico, e-hola, lethal lethal, ya peoples on
Donde viva, La vida loca, pop up like nezels on 'em
Triple x sex, yes that Vin Diesel form
Send ten winds, We like the black beatles tour
I pick up the tools, lick up and hiccup you fools
We bitter and bicker wit blickers nigga you'll sit in a pool (not water)
Agua nada, you figure that my figures are cool
Change my clothes for what, I switch up my jewels
Ya'll sing sing sing, I'm from the sing sing bing
Right to the wing ding bing, on to the spring bling fling
Now it's round one dun, ding ding ding
Cash ching ching ching, show me the bling bling king
And I get fresh, shit yes, wrist blessed
Necklace, reckless, look like a piss test (all yellow)

{talking} What the fuck else I got to say(nothin'), Got damn B, I'm that nigga, Killa!
