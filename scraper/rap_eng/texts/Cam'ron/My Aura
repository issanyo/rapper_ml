[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
We Hit To Many Left Turns To Make It Right
My Black Fist With Peace Sign Tht Save The Night
But I'm A Stay To Fight, Laser Light. With Yah Ailike
Heres An Orderblack, Be A QuarterBack, Take A Hike
Hut One Hut Two Hut Three Yah Families Tossed
PowderCoke, 81 To Yah Chest Randy Moss
How Much The Candy Cost Then I Explain To Folks
It's Terrific But Be Specific When Playin With Coke
I Refrain From My Host, Lame This Game Is A Joke
To Hit The Hot Line, Got Mine The Range To The Boat
I Move The Work From New York, To New England
New Hampshire, New London, New Jersey, New Zealand
Hopped Out Like Who Dealin Who Slingin
Brick Makin Like Who Wheelin Who Blingin
Then I Handle Weed, And Tell Them How My Parents Be
They Got The Work Go Work Get Money Back Guaranteed
But I Guarentee Money With Yah Money Ull Be After Me
Fuck It Up Huh, Undisastorbly, Casualties, Acctually
But I Move Casual, The Vunerable, Not A Judge But Call Me Yah Honorable
Go Head And Vomit Fool, Bomb The Unbombible
Do Beef Like A Farmer Do, My Jewerly Is A Carnival
Cause The God Damn Chain Is Like A FerrisWheel
You Fuckin With Sosa You Won't Find A Better Deal

[Chorus: Penz]

This Is That I Don't Give A Fuck Music
