[Hook]
You wanna kill me come and do it I don't give a fuck
Diplomats live it up, clak, clak, give it up

Yo check it out now, uh, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Yo, subliminal thoughts, 100 Centre Street, criminal court
Pissy drunk up in here, brought in gin to court
It's like a biscuit, judging my dick though, case acquitted
For this dough I'll do whatever it takes to get it
So, chain danglers, are in danger
When I skate with your ice like the Rangers, assume later
Boss bitch though, goin out like Tomb Raider
Booth razors, a few blazers, who raised him
He speak Eboni-, me and my goddaughter C-Hanni
Come through with the mean Tommy, ask you if you seen mommy
And she three feet behind me
Why my whole life is like the repeat of Gahndi
Me and G O D, from C O C, like got dough C O D
A S A P, A S A P
Play me, you crazy, and your mother ass fat
So I laid her on her stomach bust your brothers on her back
Never rubber on or cap, I'm a raw specialist
Make me more devilish, me and my whores never kiss
Though, motherfucker we was prone to die
Jeff Mob, green top, yo we own inside, motherfucker

[Hook]
You wanna kill me come and do it I don't give a fuck
Diplomats live it up, clak, clak, give it up
We gon ball till we fall, gon ride in the five
Keep pies in our eyes, stay high til we die
You wanna kill me come and do it I don't give a fuck
Diplomats live it up, clak, clak, give it up
We keep a clip in our shit, keep a brick on the trip
Keep a chick in the whip, gettin licked the six

[Verse 2]
Ayo they used to call me "Work Out"
Cuz before I brought my work out, I used to work out
Niggas wanna make deals, na na I want work out
Now murk out, before you get cursed out
Bangin they fun, same as the sun
Hidin from the church when you slang to the nuns
Chumps come through with giraffe and orangatang guns
The very best, you petty theft, you seem soft
I'm seven judges up in Supreme Court
Mean thoughts all over a teen porch
Wait, don't have to tell you shit
Matter fact, pat him down, who the hell you wit?
Yo you wack money, wait around all day for pack money
Get a gold chain talkin bout you got the Ac' money?
But everything's gonna to be all right, why
Cause every ring's gonna be all ice and
You wanna kill me come and do it I don't give a fuck
Diplomats live it up, clak, clak, give it up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This nigga with the ice mug stuntin? [He won't bust nothing]
Yo, talkin bout he gon' touch somethin [He won't bust nothing]
Yo sayin that he too much frontin [He won't bust nothing]
Yo, he just a fake thug bluffin [He won't bust nothing]
And his man with the ice grill frontin [He won't kill nothing]
Yo, he outside with the mil frontin [He won't kill nothing]
Talkin bout he some real somethin [He won't kill nothing]
Sayin yo I'mma kill something! [He won't kill nothing]
Not a collecter of Picasso, but everybody in my scepter got dough
Neglect a rock row, go to charve and not dough ho
Hector, Camacho, mi amigo rockin in the Saab bitch
Marksmen in the mob, and Cam know it
That's why I keep the BLAM BLAM loaded
Club grand open, next week we grand close it, come and kill me

Get the fuck outta here! This shit is fuckin closed!
Get the fuck outta here motherfucker I'll kill you!

[Hook]
