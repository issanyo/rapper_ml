Come on now I know how that nigga roll and he look good
[Charli]
Come on that's like my brother, he probably got a lil' dick
[Girl]
Let me find out

[Cam]
A-yo see we're just alike, call it ironic

[Charli]
But why they don't listen when I say we're platonic

[Cam]
Well you know how niggas talk just for wreck
If my dick was hard and your clit was wet

[Charli]
A-yo a-yo Cam watch your mouth, don't disrespect
I remember when your ass got hit with the Tech

[Cam]
Well I remember that girl tried to slit your neck

[Charli]
And you remember that stank bitch hittin' the deck

[Cam]
Yeah that's when your pretty ass ate coochie free though

[Charli]
And I took you off canal right down to Tito's

[Cam]
But when the cops pulled us over I had to keep the heat low

[Charli]
But I gave you the money to pay off the repo

[Cam]
A-yo you real funny

[Charli]
Yo you know how we go

[Cam]
Yeah, motherfucking peoples

[Charli]
Uh, without the egos

[Cam]
And I'll do anything for you, even give my last breath
I wish you the best

[Charli]
Man I love you to death

Chorus 1

I don't care what they think about us
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they think that we're fucking
I only love you this way

[Charli]
Don't care about the way girls thinking you twistin' my back
Bought the chrome almost so you can christen the Ac'
In '91 when you was young and I was dumb and
Robbing niggas splittin' the figgas wit you boo, screw who?
Incest, never dissed a kiss
Shine on your wrist for a birthday gift
Niggas like, you must've bent that
She never would've spent that
On Cam'Ron I bought me my first box of tampons
Bleeding in the pants at the school dance
Never took a chance at romance
Although all my friends think ya fly
But me doing that, I think I'd die
We like Thelma and JJ, Brandy and Ray J
Anyone against C and C, pulled a AK
Thinkin' 'bout sucking your dick, had me sick
But if I lost my mind, you'd be the first I'd lick

Chorus 2

I don't care if they try to avoid us
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else but
Me and you boo, me and you boo, me and you boo

[Cam]
A-yo I'm sorry yo
But when it come to Charli
I wouldn't hit that, we got back like Atari
How you live mister?
Yo you see me and CB she a wig twister
Call her my big sister
She game heads
Never wear the same threads
I wouldn't hit that if we slept in the same bed
Fucking wit her, yo shit get sliced
Her wrist is ice
And rappin', the bitch is nice
She told me how girls fool you for the bucks
And I should stay low, cool up in the cut
I told her the difference
A wooler from the blunt
That's how we get down
So cool I call her Cha'
And any girl next to her, just to run her up
That's why y'all run a muck
Thinkin' that I done her up
I thought about it once
When we grew up
But then I saw her naked
And I threw up

Chorus 1 and 2 (2x)
