[Cam'ron]
When it comes to these guns my men'll clap this
Bullets I will send you access
I'm about to Reynolds Wrap this
School all the haters, blue is the gators
Do me a favor dawg don't do me no favors
I've put undercovers, under covers
Not only that I put guns to mothers
Sons and brothers, aunts, nieces, nephews
Cousins to in-laws, no one's above us
Guns in Ruckers (Ruckers) now no one can duck us
Your parents ain't shit, y'all the sons of suckers
Son of a bitch, I sell the slugs
Keep a shotgun like Elmer Fudd
You could tell the judge dawg
I sat in the cell with thugs
One year and eight months still felt the love (no homo, all good)
Act drastic killa, pack plastic
You rap black bastard get your cap clapped backwards
Round ice, I'm as nice as Gretzky
Dug Lewinsky NC like Mike Krzyzewski
Bomb missions, Saddam vision
But I send you a tape of your sister and your mom kissin'
My dick that is, see how I foul them bitches is
Four minutes they gon' lick my kids
But no presents, keep your Rolies
I don't want you to teach me or mold me
I don’t need you to hold me, lease me or loan me
Ma I ain’t gonna feed you a phony
Keep it as homies or leave me alone B
Apologize?, I’m not sorry
I done came through got my jollies, undercovers say not the Ferrari
Yes he did do a part in dolly
What color he get? hot tamale
Who in the car with him, Oh my god its Hollys
Robinson and Berry, Fuck Eric Benet
Send slugs wherever you stay
Matter fact have her back, she was just used
She get married every two years the bitch is confused
Come to ice, I get it in cubes
Tried to get another bracelet, my wrist just refused
Bout time that I get at you dudes
If you wore size 30 couldn’t fit in these shoes
That cokey though, it fit in these shoes
Fuck the okie doke, opinion and views
Why you runnin, I’m gunnin, your linen is through
Bust you onion, a bunyon, any limb you can lose
I spit rounds, to cut kids down
And I sign to the Roc man don’t suck dick now
Dame looked out signed a gem
It’s all creme de la creme, now run tell a friend
Cats say how I get out my deal?
Dawg I pulled out my steal, I’m bout it for real
I ran in the Sony buildings
Smack grown folks around like they were only children
No one outta line, cause they spotted nines
I want out an y'all sign on the dotted line
Word homie I ain't kidding you hops
Only one to leave Sony without getting dropped
I’m about getting Glocks, I’m about hittin blocks
I’m about findin bitches that’s about lickin cock
Niggas ballin but they hoop game is sloppy
Dudes ill knock me, coupes ill drop me
Ask Luca Brasi
Before I come the mood be groggy
I hit four five, Hallelujah Papi
Yo I’m tryin to get through to Papi
I’m paying thirty-four and I want two from Papi
So you think you loc, we locer
You got that diplomat tattoo
We like coastra nostra
It’s perpetual, sit up in correctional
Come through shoot up a precinct like The Professional
Jim Jones get indicted just let me know
Put up the house buy the perico
We movin down to Mexico
Yeah there they won’t mention me
Call Tavisia we need new identities
You want Santiago

Who don’t think I’m the Don of Dons then bet me
Shit the way I bomb Saddam respects me
