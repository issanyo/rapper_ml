[Verse 1]
Since they cut my umbilical
I knew it would be inevitable, that my case should go federal
Its part of my journey, see it might concern me
But who Cam's best friend? My attorney!
Can you hold something, Can I throw you some
Now I know you dumb, Where I know you from
I ain't got it right now, but I owe you one
In your head, one shot from a loaded gun
Don't get extorted, I get escorted
To the resort, where the girls say, "Lets snort it."
I can import it, export it sports car
Lets port it, fresh auto, I report I just bought it
I scream lets get it, they ain't pimp my ride
My cars an exhibit, huh? next critic
I don't talk it I just live it, just prove it
Tell the feds Calm down, its just music

[Hook]
Man you cold fronting, beat you like you stole something
Who you talking to, I asked you can you hold something
Where I know you from huh? Where I know you from
Where I know you from scrams? Where I know you from

[Verse 2]
You got a order shorty, you should learn ring
Your baby moms know, we call her sperm bank
Crazy ho, word baby bro
Mad generous giving out fellatio
A meat eater, Ms. Dahmer Dahmer
Honor my persona, its like a piranha's momma
We move bricks on the highway
So it's bricks in my drive way
K9 come, then the 9 spray
My girl's toe ring, that's 55K
Crack in 4B, coke in 5A
Dope in 8F, the ho's in 9J
What can I say, you know how I play
We hustle all night, until the sky's gray
Why you think the whole hood corroded?
He tony the tiger, yeah he like it sugar coated

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
They got the cameras up; they want to tape a solider
Cuz I got that tan, you can call it beige & mocha
Talking in code, is sort of like playing poker
Bring the Pepsi in the oven, that's the baking soda
What up tiny bum, we were all the sorta
Feds gave em 25, damn a quarter mortar
But we from the same hood where they slaughtered porter
You a passer, me I got a scorers aura
Owe me money, your wife, son, daughter oughta
Leave the country, I'm thinking like Bora Bora
Run around with these silly secrets
Trying to keep it real, me I'm gon really keep it
You should really peep it, mack milly skeeted
In your face, any case, I'm gon really beat it
We ain't never gamble, we ain't never bet
Where I know you from scrams, we ain't never met

[Hook 2x]
