[Intro]
All my Harlem niggas
My BK niggas back uptown baby Lennox Ave
My oyes on broadway all day uh c'mon...

[Verse 1: Cam’ron]
You love the way I rep black Step the f back
'Fore we out the guns and chest check, Respect that
Any girl I met that, Hit that Love the way I spit that
I don't kit kat Push your wig back Get you shit snatched
Get your ribs cracked Got a frontin’ habit, kick that
Get that, Sit back School shit skip that
Learn how to flip pack For the big stacks
And the big act Now I got the big gat
Click, clack, uhh
Since day one been in a ditch
Kin with a snitch
Now I'm in the pen in the mix
Friends sending me flicks
Girls sending me kicks
Been in some shit
Had to tap a chin with a fist
When the ?
Begin with a stitch
End in a kiss
So yo so I blend in the mix
Now a day don't go by I ain't been in a chick
8½ on the dope ask Dominican Rich
Winning and rich
Eating on cinnamon grits
Grinning and shit
How a nigga spin in 6
See they all see the 12
But you see me in it
TVs in it
B be kitted
Ask who it is
You see me tinted
I did drive-bys
Now I take you on top of a high rise
See if you can sky dive
I'll bring it to you at your local gymnasium
How 'bout the Palladium
Fuck it Yankees Stadium uhh
Play people, jumped up and sprayed people
I got dudes that'll jig you with a AIDS needle
You not a threat
You want it you got it bet
I'll leave your momma and your poppa wet
Nigga when I’m upset
I'll go another route
Kidnap your family make you brother eat your mother out
After I done dug her out
Needles to drug her out
Pillows to smother out
You don't give a fuck about, I'm what a thug about
I'm through with it
Your crew ain't even true with it
I see your man he's like umm nothing to do with it
I know you pack like that
But Cam why you act like that
Shut up nigga clack clack clack
Pat pat pat
Rat tat tat
Put fear 'fore envy
Nigga I'm not in fear of any
I'll leave a nigga black and blue
Like a pair of Pennys
While me and Betha
Throw fiestas
By alma queta
Chicqueta, monero, nieta
Don't ever fuck around with the Don's cheddar
See Jimmy Jones frontin' in the chancletas
Or the black boots, jumpin’ out to act cool
Cars never lease 'em
Girls ? 'em
My man and his wifey want me down with the threesome
Niggas tease 'em
Bitches please 'em
When I'm out of town yo my pants gotta crease 'em
All calls valid
Never hard mallet
Dallas
Been up in your favorite star's stylist
Coward
Bite on my hoes like Marv Albert
But you should thank Un though
Coulda made you run though
Been at your front door
Gun hold for fun though

[Bridge: (Anonymous Male Voice) & Cam'ron]
(Yo, yo, yo, yo)
What's up?
(What the fuck is wrong with you?)
Fuck that it's not a game
(Yo, you ain't gotta be rhymin' for niggas like that)
Man fuck them niggas B
(Yo, you know what you do)
What?
(Tell these niggas the real deal)
Aight check it

[Verse 2: Cam’ron]
Aiyyo I'm ?, cook up the crack
Everytime you look up a gat
Got you shook up attack huh
Look in the back, nah
The guns I had put in the back
I want the hook up in check
On this work of the rap
Now I'm not saying what I like
Or what I dislike
But get the fuck out my face til' your shit's right
See baby boy I carry guns, you know the big type
The kind that might give you a 10 year fear of life
And I was just like y'all flippin' hundred pack
But nowadays I'm a owner, you a runningback
You got to understand baby I'm done with the crack
I get pure white coke from Columbian cats
Or the cocaine plan
Leave your whole brain dead
Light this herb
Don't mean to disturb
Never been to Sesame Street but I flip a big bird
And I know stealers and they not from Pittsburgh
No kids rapping or ostriches
Just kidnappings and hostages
So, y'all better obey
We shoot pro way
Mess with us no way
Now go 'head go play
