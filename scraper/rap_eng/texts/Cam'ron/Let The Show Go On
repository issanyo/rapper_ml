[Chorus:]
Let the show begin!
Open up your heart (Let the show begin!)
Give me the love within (Let the show begin!)
So put your arms around me now (round me now!)
And let (ya dig) the show begin (Show begin)

[Verse 1:]
Ya dig! Ya dig! Ya dig!
Now I don’t know how many wonders of the world there are
But I do know that she is one of them so let’s just (Let the show begin!)
Now comin to d stage is the hardest workin international entertainer
Y’all know you’re not workin (Let the show begin!)
Miss 30 shows in 30 days
From London and New York, Dubai to Detroit
Miami, LA, d bay and Philly’s on fire!
Rejoice please, get ready for Estelle!
Come on, come on (let’s go!)
I came here to have a party
Throw them up, let’s have a party
Let’s go dumb and have this party!
Yo! Out your seats, let it roll at the top!
Let it rock, I say we rock, baby!
(Let the show begin!) Yea!
I come from London to America
Go do this like I’m Tina, Diana or Erica!
Huh, we’re riding low, make some noise
With my ladies, with my boys
Baby, what?!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
All from Harlem, baby!
Or in that place I write a novel
I’ll be up inside the whore house, white people call them brothels!
Ain’t no need to be that hostile
Got that white girl, she no model but she’ll open up your notch
The shit I’m doing is colossal
Man, you’re forty and you’re bitching me. What you’re sellin- fossils?!
The rest is history, no mystery
Wanna get with me, wanna get to me?
Gotta get the trees and kiss the D
And do this for me!

[Chorus]
