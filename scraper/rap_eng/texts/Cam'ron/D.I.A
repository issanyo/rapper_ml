[Intro-Ric Flair]
I can't help it that I'm custom made
I can't help it that I look good
Smell good
Whoo!!
Can dance all night long
It's America
If I want to wear a Rolex watch
You haven't got one, you understand?
Ha ha ha ha!!!!!

[Verse 1]
In my car I had two girls
A quarter mill, pill poppers and pistols, y'all
Bounce they will round, got 'em back from 'frisco, yall
Lost a package, hit a wall, got it back, I'm sitting tall
Maybe that's the reason that my wrist look like a disco ball
Who want to dance, man? Let's take it to the disco, y'all
Remember I ain't write for a year straight, I drink Cisco, y'all
This when I was 17, basketball, hollow tips
Hollow tips came first so of course
A nigga ain't got that scholarship
Fuck it
I ain't cared, never cared, not one for politics
King of Harlem took me on that path, please acknowledge it
Towers fell, power gained, still let the sour form
I ain't talking makeup when niggas was in that powder room
A lot of (nasal inhale), fiends coughing up mucus
Give me mine, hurry up, clean that up, I'm still the cutest
Baby 23 she on me like, Killa, you still the cutest
Then she got naked, Honey, so you's a nudist
Still move heroin, 3 piece suit with the Rollie on
Stamps stay fresh, should have named this the Pokemon
That's how fiends was acting, like niggas was looking for Pokemon
Me, I made a left, to get it right, I know I'm wrong
What's going on? Still flowing strong
Niggas struggling, oh, they just holding on (who are you?)
I'm Aaron Rodgers turn around, I'm going long
My dick the car, on your knees, blow the horn
This the winter, spring too, summer, fall
I'm D.I.A, What's that?
Done It All
Baby turn around, yeah, you the one I called
Her friend said, "What you want?", I looked and said, "None of y'all"
Gold bottling, hoes hollering
Funky fresh in the flesh, Dave Koresh Cult following
A King Solomon, look at him, not a thing bothers him
On the corner, chicken wing, gobbling
I'm here to dismiss the myth of Ghosts and Goblins
We will leave you ghost from the toast
Oh not again
Snatch your siblings up, I'm really on it
The rap game be mine, I really want it
I stack hundreds, sit back blunted, this cat's done it
I taught bitches how to ball like Pat Summitt
The heroin went and flew in first class
To bag it up, you need scrubs and a nurse mask
Yeah boy, you looking at a dirtbag
50 kis in the tub, that's a real bird bath
Shit, all you mother fucking purse snatchers
Till you seen me, you never heard the word swagger
Nope you never heard the word swagger
Shout out to Dan man but I define the word dapper
(Who you)
Dapper Cam
No clothes on, got a prodigy
Stab your brain with your nose bone
Shit, got that line from the infamous
Black Trump tho, look at my apprentices
Shit, tryna finish all my sentences
I called my niggas up and we can start the senselessness
I'm a chemist
Put tools in your mouth, no dentists
Society yeah they know me
No movie, a true menace
Lieutenant hit off the tenants
Some tenants right off of Atlantic Forgot that they owed us money
We just took out his appendix
