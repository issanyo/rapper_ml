[Intro: Cam'ron]

This sounds like a musical
I guess it is a musical

Killa!

[Begin Hook: "It's Time I Made it to the Top"]

Dipset, bitch!
This is for anybody that had to go out and hustle
Had to go out and get they own
Never had anybody give them anything
Let's do it
C'mon! Uh!

[End Hook]

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Why it feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money, if I'm moving weight?
Fucking with Jorge
Up on Broadway, had me in a hallway
Come on primo, I ain't got all day
This shit he called yay was white like the Aspens
I got home, that white was some Aspirin
Took to tenement despite what had happened
Beat up lieutenants, had fights with the captains
Over loot I kept hammers on the roof
And word to grandma I was cute
With my bandana on the boot
I realized I wanted cameras on the coupe
And I couldn't get that jam
And standing on the stoop
This don't move me money
This chicken wing, new kick, cab fare and movie money

[Female Acquaintance]
What about my hair?

[Cam'ron]
Don't think your boobies funny
But the rest is re-up
Next week should do me honey

[Female Acquaintance]
Next week?

[Cam'ron]
You know I got to get the block back popping, you know

[Begin Hook: "It's Time I Made it to the Top"]

I'm 'a get us right though, trust me baby

Yo I'm gonna get on a serious grind, for real

I just need a down chick, you with me ma? You with me?

[End Hook]

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]

Hey yo

I don't think it's fair hun, that I wear guns
Cop work, hustle hard and can't get your hair done

So you with me ma?

[Female Acquaintance]

I'm with you pa

[Cam'ron]
Yo, you start the car
I'm 'a split this cigar
Our relationship:
Throat to penis
I know, but Cam's about dough, I mean this
I got a spot close to Phoenix
I take suggestions
But you can't coach a genius
So you with me lady?

[Female Acquaintance]
I'm with you baby

[Cam'ron]
Good, I'm 'a load the eighty
Cause this flip is crazy
And I'm too wanted
But you sell to anybody who want it
One gram, two hundred
You playing twenty-eight
You flip a hundred daily
That's seventeen, too
Soon you'll understand me
I'm 'a make it ma'

[Female Acquaintance]
Yeah, you'll make it boo

[Cam'ron]
I'm 'a make it pop, you know where I'm taking you

[Female Acquaintance]
Where you taking me?

[Cam'ron]
To the top, ma

[Begin Hook: "It's Time I Made it to the Top"]
I did it this time
Look at your boy
Look at me, ma!

[End Hook]

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
So you see I'm on the dee-low, mister
I will creep your sister
To my crib in Jersey
Rio Vista
All the wrist got deserved to flow bossy
My murder hoes flossy in that Sergio Rossi
My squad is the realest
I thank God that you feel us
Me and Jim's the real Arnold and Willis
We armed in gorillas
Cause it's Diff'rent Strokes on the block, butâ€¦
