[Verse 1: Cam'Ron]
Unh, yo, more then ten birds, I'll serve it to 'em
Broke niggas, huh, I'm allergic to em
Like Aaliyah, listen I'm one in a million
Elevator in the house, you ain't got one in yo buildin'
He walkin up five flights
Nope! Couldn't be my life
Used to be, then they got sideswiped
Te-ne-ne te-ne-ne, highlights!
Hit the highway, hard like a prize fight
Dope tan, oh man, yeah and the pies white
AK, mase lift, that's the basics
The base thick, taste it, no need to bake it
The bracelet, look down - matchin the Asics
Hey pricks, say it, I'm yo favorite
Coupe de Ville stupid ill, yep and the suede thick
New York Post, I'm usually on page six
Not the lottery but you gon take six
I see ya girl and I wave like "Heyyy bitchhh!"
They say I'm sorta crazy
I 'ont know, maybe its something in the water babyyy

[Hook: Cam'Ron]
Jyea, jyea, jyea, jyea it's Killa Season

Jyea, jyea, jyea, jyea it's Killa Season
Scrilla is still the reason

[Verse 2: Cam'Ron]
Yo, we beat the first trial, fuck the appeal
If not, it get ugly like Seal
Nigga tried to front on me like ma won't dump for me
But I'm by myself, my mother said no company
So I got the pump on me, comfortably
Hunger? Please!
Fuck that - a hundred thou in the dungarees
Niggas hate life, I love the world
Got hood bitches, down to Cover Girls
Check the magazines, I'm on the cover girl
Makin ma mad girl say brother earlll
Yeah, throw up, then I looked at em like "Grow up!"
Check the jewelry, it's a bit risky
R. Kelly edition, yeah the shit pissy

9, techs, macs, wit the fifty clip

[Hook: Cam'Ron]
Jyea, jyea, jyea, jyea it's Killa Season

Jyea, jyea, jyea, jyea it's Killa Season
Scrilla is still the reason

[Verse 3: Cam'Ron]
Yo when it come to beef, I'm effortless
Get ya trenchcoat, it's treacherous
Remember this, I'm one that you never diss
The professional, slash terrorist
Write ya name down, put it on a special list
When it come to murder, we specialists
I been winnin so long, they had to hate it
When I say "necklace", decapitated
Coke and coffee, yeah, decaffeinated
How you gettin money, and he aggravated?
Nigga fascinated, two girls masturbated
Pulled the whip out, left lacerated

[Hook: Cam'Ron]
Jyea, jyea, jyea, jyea it's Killa Season
Scrilla is still the reason
Jyea, jyea, jyea, jyea it's Killa Season
Scrilla is still the reason
