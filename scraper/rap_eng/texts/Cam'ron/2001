Welcome to a Muslim's mind
Previously written in 2016
Two thousand and one they crashed the planes
Couple of weeks after purchasing put options
They're murderers and killers, murdering and killing for cash
I'm a OG and a mathematician, subtraction, addition
Division is what they're creating, like cracks in paintings
Multiplication, got us thinking about procreating
I'll gave you a little more, like an addict that begging for more
You're approaching the limit, just take it like a whore
In this world you get smacked up, this life is a war
That's a given, I'll rock your world
Straight from the underground
To avoid enemy rounds
While you clap your women
I'll take em out swimming
I'm black and I'm living
I'm the bomb homie gimmie a ribbon
I'm where fact meets fiction
Strikes are what I'm pitching
Cats going to maximum prison
Cuz they ratting and snitching
Cause when Feds come, homies mouths run
But the outcome, gon' be 'bout guns
Cause I don't bitch, and I don't snitch
Scammin’ for every book I can get my hands on
Plannin’ for the future see me now as I stands on
Cause I don't keep grams in my boots
Damn, I would shoot but fam I would soup
Thought Ayar was too cute to stand on the stoop
My Spanish recruit, outlandish with loot
We got obsessed with Miami, cannons, and coupes
Baskin' in robbin', I'm laughin' and poppin'
It's all for Bloodshed though, I haven't forgotten
From the night to the days, my triflin ways
I'm chasing that platinum plaque right to my grave, dog
You chill in the lobby, you feelin this probably
If you know me well, there's a tear in your eye, and chill down your body
Take it in stride, let's bake up these pies
Uber, no homo, hop on and take this ride
To the top of the mountain
Bout to get this shit poppin' and bouncin'
Now that I'm down, the Ka'bah's surrounded (Feel me?)
Afford all the best, but bought all the wet
Down with Christianity but loyal to Islam
I know you people hate it
How I got outta the dark
And turned into a shark
Heaven is next
