(Juelz Santana)
I feel like dropping something man
Yo they tried to box me in the corner for the longest
No key, locked me in this corner for the longest but
Common man they can't fuck with me, Juelz Santana
Uh, some how I managed to creep from under the rock
Linking up with Cam and linking up with the Roc now
Shit I told you, I won't fail you niggas man
Yo this is powerful music I bring to this table
The sequels are able the way I sling cane cause
Let the music talk to them
Yo, y'all know I'm fast in focus in case you haven't noticed
Squeeze and blast them open as soon as the magnum open
Yeah I told you man
Uh, Cam gone make me a star, I'mma make him a million
Jones is here I'm invading the building and
Yeah Diplomat
For the last time we got this man
But I'm still on the corner grinding for them big stacks
Big coat, big gat, don't ever forget that

(Jim Jones)
Yes I'm, yes uh, oh yeah nigga
Yo, eyo my gold link can be number one on your charts
If it happens so be it we come with the art
Everyone in my part, they still moving
All them chums in the front of the
Yo I do this shit sick, stuffed and congested
They don't give a fuck if you're sick you still get cuffed and arrested
My justice is wretched
You get knocked down please grab your crutches keep stepping
Cause the game we done held back too long
The pain we done felt that too long
Cocaine we done dealt that too long
And my pops it don't help that you gone, myself to move on
Its scary and I'm gonna need help
Streets flaunting me, dogs and marijuana don't help
Fiends, junkies in the corner don't help
Knee deep in my grave on these blocks I'm a goner myself but

(Cam'Ron)
Huh, killa, I'm here y'all
Huh, I'm ready, I'm ready, huh, hey
Hey, Yo what up buzzing buzzing, bird flip a dozen dozen
Holla at your boy boy, you thought your cousin wasn't
I'm ready, yes sir here we go
Jim Jones (??)bones Santana many feet
You niggas know Holla at me if there's any beef
Yes sir, huh
I know in vise versa we like murder we convict in the truck
But yo if you got bitches to fuck hit me up dog
Yeah I'm ready, huh
Far as lyrics go they rocking recitals
It won't stop until I'm on top with the title
Hustling no stopping the cycle, I'm shopping for rifles
I'm not for the idols
Fuck the twin towers dog, we on top of the Eiffel
Like live Pisa Pisa, eating a piece of pizza
You can't be were I be dog, you need a visa
Common chief of reefer
Please believe it, I will squeeze and ya
All bullets they will heat and seek ya
Harlem world I'mma swell my town
You a clown you can tell by now
That I'm, I'm ready, I'm ready we coming for the title
