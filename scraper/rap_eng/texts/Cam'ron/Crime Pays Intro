All generals stand in line, salute nigga

(verse 1)
You know me from spendin the loot
Also put rims on the coupe
Remember Duke I spin to shoot
I ain't here to kid the yout
Skip a loose, get an ounce, flip a deuce, hit the stoop
Remember stupid I'm here to tell you that I'm living proof
CRIME PAYS!
I'm glad you hate, nigga go masturbate
Took my cap and gown pictures but I ain't graduate
CRIME PAYS!
What a vision to see
O.G. glisten and glee, sit in the V
Did it in three, homeboy listen to me

(hook)
Crime pays
99 ways, 9 gauge, AK-47 homey hit the highway
Crime pays
I got a record company, liquor and clothing line
Cause my weed was fresh, coke was white, dope was nine

(verse 2)
BIRD CAGE! That's what it's gonna be
3rd grade Mr. Massey asked us what we wanna be
Jeff said a lifeguard, Bobby said a firefighter
Jeff gonna have a Porsche and Bobby said he'll have a Spyder
David said police, Wanda said she wished to dance
They gonna get married, have a big crib in France
I started actin up, wait a minute back it up
This ain't math class but this shit ain't adding up
Then Mr. Massey looked and that's when the teacher asked
"You got a problem Cam" Yeah, I should teach this class
Maybe I'll reach they ass
Tell em they don't need to have degrees in math
Know your credit, debit, plus receipts for cash
A few geeks had laughed, I told the dude stop your wishin
You won't have a pot to piss in with that damn job you gettin
Call Cam a gift, they wasn't understanding this
Damn I'm rich, a drug dealer turned out philanthropist

(hook x2)
Crime pays
99 ways, 9 gauge, AK-47 homey hit the highway
Crime pays
I got a record company, liquor and clothing line
Cause my weed was fresh, coke was white, dope was nine
