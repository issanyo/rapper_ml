[Intro: Cam'ron]
Uhh, Killa, yo...
You got to wonder man, what is all this shit really worth
Y'knahmean? Uhh, uhh, you ain't got ya man here to share it with
Yo, fucked up man, yo

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
I been on both sides of burglaries, guns out and choked up
Man, this shit'll get you choked up
I'da been shot at, got at, backstabbed, coked up
Almost doped up, but had no guts
So I pimp all these hoe sluts
When they period come it get slow, but so what
I got big plans to blow up
I'ma love this year, but Blood ain't here
We would puff grass, plus hash, cut class
To fuck ass, dough, we had enough cash
Little cats, he would see y'all dreams
Eighteen with the three-eighteen, that's Blood y'all (Blood y'all...)
He had hot gear, rocks yeah
Now that he's not here, I feel that it's not fair
Fuck see him at the crossroads, wanna see him drive across road
Poor, stole, then floss mo', had to tell a few niggas
"My man was a hell of a nigga", swell with the triggers
Whatever ethnic problem dawg, better check it
Little Cam, it's just Bloodshed resurrected
Death to birth, "logic" I said
Four months, got him some head, right in the bed
Listen dawg, I'm beyond dead
This ain't even me spittin', this Derek Michael Armstead

[Chorus: Eric Robertson]
For my fam, keep it up, those that fell, pick them up
They been here, that's whassup, tomorrow's not promised
To my streets, hold it down, all these hoes, hold your ground
Let's not wait, get it now, tomorrow's not promised, no

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Yo.. yo, I never had fights in rings
I just had fight for rings, ice and bling
I done spent nights in bings
Now I realized Christ the King, ain't no righteous thing
But how I get the right to sing?
And the streets be talkin' like Donahue
Clowns, they belong on Comic View
That's why the Feds onto you
When they form they assembly's
You stuck on the block like the Ave. got parenthesis
Cause everybody gotta war story (shit)
I swear to God, I hear more and more stories (damn)
I'm in Jersey, the crib, four stories
Add a fifth one in case the fourth one bore me (Killa!)
I done ran through the NBC's, CBS's, 3GS's, VVS's
Baggetteses, princess cuts, diamond layers
And I never said, "I'm a player"
But I been down with messy action
Similar to Jessie Jackson, regret what happen
Ma kept resistin, I had to bounce with my shipment
I'm scared of commitment
I'm a hustler, work in the closet, work in the kitchen
Outside, workin' them pigeons, work on the block
Even put in work with the Glock
Work on the toilet, I'ma work-a-holic

[Chorus: Eric Robertson]
For my fam, keep it up, those that fell, pick them up
They been here, that's whassup, tomorrow's not promised
To my streets, hold it down, all these hoes, hold your ground
Let's not wait, get it now, tomorrow's not promised, no
For my fam, keep it up, those that fell, pick them up
They been here, that's whassup, tomorrow's not promised
To my streets, hold it down, all these hoes, hold your ground
Let's not wait, get it now, tomorrow's not promised, no
