[Intro]
Killa, Dipset
Check my stats man (seventy-eight and O {78-0})
I got to be the best livin' man (you already know)
Holla at me

[Verse 1]
Like Alex Trebek, you're in "Jeopardy"
Yesiree, got the recipe
Give ya a tech, but nope, not a referee
Like Wyclef, I'm a refugee, rollie-wear
Cocky, don't play hockey, but have your mommy goalie gear
See the ice, grab the stick, hit the break pads
Get her knee pads, penalty, face mask
I face grab the don enter the don's in her
The don of don play the dug-out like Don Zimmer
I hang wit' Steinbrenner just to get my cash turn
I call my car Jamal, it get "Mashburn"
Crashburn, rest in peace, Dale Earnhardt
My cousin died the same way, hit that turn hard
So I stack from the gamblin'
Drop cash in the phantom
Play "DIPSET, DIPSET" yeah, the National Anthem
Drive the seven series, to the World Series
I'm so serious I want the whole world hear me

[Hook] 2x
Man I got to be the best livin'
That's a given, check my stats
This the halftime show, what could mess wit that
Killa Cam' Killa Cam'
What's ya name huh? Killa Cam' Killa Cam'

[Verse 2]
Man you know how I line my backs (how?)
With a dime of crack (oh)
They slang to the rack, through the legs, behind the back
Wanna play for my team? Come sign the track
Treat you like a sprinter, I find the track
If you hype I got hyper men, Spiderman
In Minnesota my Vikings sell Vicodins
I got clients connects, my alliance respect
I'm like New York football, Giants on Jets
Even Buffalo Bills, my deals up in those mills
But I still cop keys, fuck with those crills
Yeah, up in those hills, where they have chosen to feel
The face dive in the snow, nose in they grill
I be with Don King, if you a fighter, good
Fuck Tiger Woods, it's tigers in the hood (Harlem)
So come test the birdie, if ya stretched the dirty
Give ya your Quarterback like Testaverde

[Hook] 2x
Man I got to be the best livin'
That's a given, check my stats
This the halftime show, what could mess wit that
Killa Cam' Killa Cam'
What's ya name huh? Killa Cam' Killa Cam'
