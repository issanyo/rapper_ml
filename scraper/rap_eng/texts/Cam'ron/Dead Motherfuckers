[Verse 1: Cam'ron]

Everybody out at the rock the mic tour
I'm back in the kitchen rocking the white raw
Copping ya pint four
Locking ya nice doors
I pop in ya light four with chickens that like gore
They clicking they like war
Fixing to fight for
Look at my ice for sure ya sight's sore
We all wearing links
As I prepare a drink
Glare and think
How I got the whole New York wearing pink
Girls they stare and wink
How I flare the mink
Drop the top pop a throttle
Cock a Glock pop a bottle
Seen paid in full now I'm in blockbuster
And I'm paid in full still on the block buster
9 4 rockrucker 01 rob Rucker
Shogun show guns blow one
You not gutter
Little inside joke for you cocksuckers
My block sucker
Popcorn and hot butter
Like it's the movie theater
But it's the uzi area
Whodie who called whodie who produce hysteria
And me I ain't no coat tail bitch
I get the motel six
With them wholesale bricks

(chorus)
(voice)
Better be love
I'm leaving depend it all
To get your love
[Cam'ron]
Jump back
Glock cock
Aim shoot
[Juelz]
Yall some dead motherfuckers
(repeat 4 times)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]

I tell bitches straight up
Get in the car
I'm the shit in the car
I do like Alfred though shit in ya car
Pop a squat in the drop
Take a drop in the drop
While you dropping the top
Unlocking ya locks
Damn last year y'all got a mask and y'all robbed
I imagine it's hard
Y'all asking for jobs
Realize I'm attached to the mob
Sell the crack in the park
Blow the sacks in the saab
The chrome give you skin burn
In ya dome like ring worms
And niggas coming home
They my interns
We the cake couple
Put together great puzzles
The hood ain't loves us
The hood together we stay subtle
Juggle bubble
Why y'all niggas hate tussles
I ain't always hustle
I was mase muscle
He had the one so he bought the body
I had the gun so I caught the body
Done son off in the lobby
I stayed with the gun shooters
Jum movers
Razoo kahluah
Turn one ruler
To sun dueler
And the same brother that you knew
Came through in the range same color as yoo-hoo
Y'all know that's the same color as doo doo
(shit)I'm the shit call me pepe le poo poo
And I got esses thats coo coo
Get fresh yay like they loo loo
For fresh yay they'll do you

(chorus)
