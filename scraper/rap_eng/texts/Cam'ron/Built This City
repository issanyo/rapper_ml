[Intro: Cam'ron]
Killa, Killa
Santana, Jones, Hell Rell
You already know what it is
We did it y'all
{We built this city}
{We built this city}
(They sucking us, right?)
{We built this city}
{We built this city on rock}
Let's get it rocking y'all
Killa, uhh
(Diplomats man)

[Chorus: Starship sample (Cam'ron)]
We built this city (on these blocks we hustle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (turn bricks to whips)
We built this city on rock and roll (on rock)
We built this city (in the midst of the struggle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (from bottom to top)
We built this city on rock and roll
(Through the agony, pain, diplomatical reign)

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Ayo, my Dipset Taliban
We on these streets like the wars on them streets of Afghanistan
Better yet of Pakistan
To America, Harlem's Al Qaeda
Any problems I spray ya, not to startle the mayor
But in this 50-block radius, let's get the rock and shave the shit
Or get the Glock and blaze the shit
Bitches get the cock and savor it
They say Jim Jones the Capo my favorite (motherfuckers!)
(Let's get it, shit)
'Cause some of this shit my city wasn't built up over
Drugs and money, some shit you get killed up over
Slumped on your wheel, straight tilted over
Trust me dogs, I seen it in peril
Niggas wasted and painted and seen on the mural
(That's Harlem) In this apple of mine is rotten, damn
Clap up your shines, pop shots that'll crack up your minds
And cop rocks and cook that crack up to dimes
New York City, the capital of crime

[Chorus: Starship sample (Cam'ron)]
We built this city (from the packing and stacking)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (from the scrambling and gambling)
We built this city on rock and roll (on rock)
We built this city (from the packing and stacking)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (from the scrambling and gambling)
We built this city on rock and roll
(Blamming the cannon, at ya face, mother.. uh)

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Yo, now once again it's Santana the Great
I built this city on hammers and weight
Gasoline, rope, bandanas and tape
Lots of fiends, lots of coke being handed away
You know the usual
Shut 'em down, set up show, how we usually do
Cut 'em down, dead the block man, we moving through
Diplomats is the strongest force
On and off the court we ball, it's more than sports, motherfucker!
(It's Santana nigga, come on)
We built this city from ground zero
To spitting the pound zero, brown pistol at ya, get down kicko
Yeah, this is from the ground up, nigga
So get your weight and your pounds up, nigga
'Cause when it's beef my homies mount up quicker
Fit the pound much quicker, lay you down much quicker
You never been approached by golden Eagles
Vultures that'll scope and feed you
No court just leave you, shit you know

[Chorus: Starship sample (Cam'ron)]
We built this city (on blood sweat and tears)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (we gon' make it to the top)
We built this city on rock and roll (on rock)
We built this city (through blood sweat and tears)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (blood sweat and tears)
We built this city on rock and roll
(Through the trials and tribulations
We gon' make it through the years, c'mon)

[Verse 3: Hell Rell]
Yo, yo
It's like what I wouldn't do for a buck
Our enemies can't rest in peace Jones, we shoot they funerals up
New gangstas in the city, bitch, ring the alarm
All y'all hoes bow down, kiss the ring of a Don
It's about to get real big playa, humongous
Stacked money so long 'til it grew fungus
We was gon' let you live until you threw punches
Now we got to get critical and we got to get rid of you
And we the most talked about, the most popular
We live by the codes, we the Dipset mafia
You never know who's watching ya
You never know who's plotting to pop at ya
We focused like a pair of binoculars
I'm 'bout to get gritty
M-5 CLK's garage look like Alphabet City
And I'm a hustler, I put cracks in communities
Cops can't touch me, got Diplomatic Immunity
Now try but I'm guaranteed a million shipped in scan
If not, back to the block, ship some grams

[Verse 4: Cam'ron]
Killa... if not, get with Cam
I got clips to lift a van, flip a van
Shit, they can kick the can
This cat think he sling 'cause he got a pinky ring
Rinky-dink diamonds, they don't even make your pinky bling
(We built this city) And now I'm 'bout to kill this city
(We built this city) Krills to 50, yeah I'm acting real sadiddy
(We built this city) 'Cause I collect mils in fifties
For real it's pretty and y'all gon' feel the pity, Killa
Dipset bitch.. rock, rock

[Chorus: Starship sample (Cam'ron)]
We built this city (on blood sweat and tears)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (we gon' make it to the top)
We built this city on rock and roll (on rock)
We built this city (through blood sweat and tears)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (blood sweat and tears)
We built this city on rock and roll
(Through the trials and tribulations
We gon' make it through the years, c'mon)

We built this city (on these blocks we hustle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (turn bricks to whips, huh)
We built this city on rock and roll (on rock)
We built this city (in the midst of the struggle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (from bottom to top)
We built this city on rock and roll
(Through the agony, pain, diplomatical reign, uhh)
