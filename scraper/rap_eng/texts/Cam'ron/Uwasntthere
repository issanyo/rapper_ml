[Verse]
People were scared of me
My dad ain't care for me
Thank god for Toy Dawkins
She took care of me
Bloodshed was there for me
When death was looking in
My mom was doing hard
Grandma Dot took me in
Argued with Grampa Jerry
Scheme with Uncle Teddy
Ain't fuck with Cousin Joe, he was to petty
Thanks to Dave & Rock, that was nice of y'all
They wouldn't give me work (Why ?) 'cause I was nice in ball
This was the 9th grade
Working out with barbells
Then me and Hud bought  50 grams
Thought we was a cartel
What was we smuglling, I was struggling
Rapping, playing ball, plus hustling
Digga did tracks for me
Big L rapped with me
AJ held the guns
He'll still clap for me
Shout to Chasity, her sister Daphony
They drove across the bridge for us, yes the Tappan Zee (yes)
Let me speed up the story of pain and agony
Finally got a deal, more like a tragedy
Good looking Lance Rivera
Jacob for backing me
But I get money on these streets man, factually
Actually, Dominican Rich just gave some smack to me
And I had coke already, came up with a strategy
Kept it at Kim crib, the stove locked it up
Fat Shawn rocked it up, Duke the God chopped it up
Stash box in the car, hit the button stock it up
I was wilding man, and got up with the Taliban
Luca Brasi, introduced me to [Milt]
After that it was a wrap had Ohio on tilt
In Chicago, yo, I'm ballin' I felt like I'm Wilt
And that's the truth of how the funding for Dipset was built
Why they give me these odds
This goddamn city of ours, the city of God
Still I drove off in the prettiest cars
Some was unfortunate, pine box or orphanage
Watching your sibilings turning into foster kids
