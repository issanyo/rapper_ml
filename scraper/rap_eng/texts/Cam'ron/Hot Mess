[Cam'ron]
Its young 60 minutes AKA 1 hour
AKA SK, AK gun powder
50 bullets aka one shower
I walk in nike town
I tell em wipe me down
But the fun begun
Yes its summer hun
Somebody call chuck and flav im PE #1
Get the S1W's professor griff
Let it slide? nope im at home plate with the catchers mitt
There go cam braggin
Nana mad cause my pants saggin
All she said is "you's a hot mess"
I tell her I ball, baby look at my walls
Shop on the ground I get it out the skymall
Its young CNN, NBC, CBS, TNT, HBO, showtime, CBS
See the borrough G5, yes sir GPS
One diamond 100 carats yes sir V.V.S

[Chorus]
When i got dressed
Rather when i got fresh
Pants sag, gun on, nana said you's a hot mess
You's a hot mess, you's a hot mess, umm you's a hot mess
Boy you's a hot mess

[Verse 2]
Yall are my clones, fresh whips fly homes
Careful when u drive home, youll walk into a cyclone
Over them dry stones
Fiends slept in front of my crib for 2 days straight, like I had the iphone
Pies on i'll bet some pies on
The 2,4 and 6 train the only thing theyll ride on
Ask em why play with my pay
I pitch China in Boston, like Daisuke that white yay
And all this carrot cake, well its enough to irritate
But im so fly high i fuck around and wear a cape
And pardon if you in the garden just beware of bait
They starvin, niggas eatin, nope they wouldn't share they steak
Youll find em out of state near a lake severely raped
Gettin ate by some apes, deers, bears or snakes
So I tuck the llama, yeah enough with drama
I seen a nice slut, big butt with a touch of honor
I let her touch the ganja
I could be ya sponsor
I got one mother right, but i could use another mama
Did I pop? yes. hit it hard got dressed
And all the bitch said "killa you's a hot mess"

[Chorus]
When i got dressed
Rather when i got fresh
Pants sag, gun on, nana said you's a hot mess
You's a hot mess, you's a hot mess, umm you's a hot mess
Boy you's a hot mess
