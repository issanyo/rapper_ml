[Intro: blackbear]
Yeah, I make money, I start trends
My first car, it was a Benz
My whole closet, your whole crib
See through shirt on, bright pink Timbs

[Verse 1: blackbear]
I look so rich my looks break bread, yeah
Your main chick a 6, a 7 at best
She leave with me, she turned to a 10, just like that
No time for games, I'm a damn grown man
I keep a Remington loaded next to bed
Ready whenever, whenever it is
If you rock Yeezys then we can't be friends, we can't be friends
If you rock Yeezys then we can't be friends, nah, nah
I see what you're doin'
And it don't make sense, but I ain't a manager
If you want a hook or a beat
It ain't gonna be cheap, bring the bands with you
The more I achieve, the more they be hatin'
Lowkey they be sayin' they always believed in me
Know that they cheated me
Know that they lyin' and I keep on grindin', yeah

[Chorus: blackbear]
I get money, I start trends
My first car, it was a Benz, yeah
Lonely at top, no friends
See through shirt on, bright pink Timbs
Bright pink Timbs, bright pink Timbs
Bright pink Timbs, bright pink Timbs
See through shirt on, bright pink Timbs
See through shirt on, bright pink Timbs

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Uh, Cam, he a flirt
See-through shirt, bright pink toes (bright)
Me, I come through, bright pink Rolls
Bright pink Rolls
Understand this, that I came from the jungle
It made me a monster
But I think you're fine and we're spendin' some time
You could be a dime, but you need you a sponsor
And it's between us
If I do it then I do it, no need to announce
And don't even ask
These shoes I got on, you could never pronounce
I know what you're used to
Dinner, Netflix, smoke you an ounce
I'll tell you like this, girl
Get your passport, no luggage, let's bounce
Up, up, away, tonight we land
Tomorrow we leave, it's all part of the plan
Six day trip, Monaco, Sicily
Roamin' in Rome, to post in Japan
So what you wanna do?
Ball in your court, it's all in your hands
Oh what's my name?
Killa Cam, but call me the man
'Cause...

[Chorus: blackbear]
I get money, I start trends
My first car, it was a Benz, yeah
Lonely at top, no friends
See through shirt on, bright pink Timbs
Bright pink Timbs, bright pink Timbs
Bright pink Timbs, bright pink Timbs
See through shirt on, bright pink Timbs
See through shirt on, bright pink Timbs
