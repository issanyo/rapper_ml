[Intro]
See y'all don't like it when I'm nice
Y'all only like it when I'm ignorant
So that's exactly what you get
Lucy, I'm home! Lucy, I'm home!
Ugh, talk to 'em...

[Verse 1]
Kanye got on stage, what he do? Played Jay-Z out
What he do next? Check into the crazy house?
Fuck that you made a living talking greazy
Besides that, man, you Yeezy with the Yeezy's
Be yourself, you ain't gotta go AWOL
And fuck that 'Ye, I been this way since yay tall
If you regret it then dead but if you said it, you said it
You meant what you said, can't tell me forgive and forget it
I'm different, I'm from a different type of hunger nigga
Ask OG Juan how I was when I was younger nigga
Shout to Fat Mike, Dave and Rock and they brother Mel
[?] just some east side niggas, I know they wouldn't tell
But peep the details, it's me, weed and females
Two to be exact, I met 'em doing some retail
Chanel bags, both had on the Adidas with the sea shells
Asked what they do, boo said "Real estate and weed sales"

[Hook]
Coleslaw, ain't nobody seeing you
Coleslaw, no nobody wanna be with you
Coleslaw, nah, ain't nobody eating you
They misleading you, yeah mistreating you, nigga
Coleslaw, ain't nobody seeing you
Coleslaw, no nobody wanna be with you
Coleslaw, nah, ain't nobody eating you
They misleading you, yeah mistreating you, nigga

[Verse 2]
It's funny, funny niggas like Bill Murray
Why? Funny because they still worry
Warn 'em, tell 'em throw up a Hail Mary
Who you? I raise my shooter, I'm Dell Curry
Damn baby! I couldn't help but stare at your ass
But them [?] been in your head though a year and a half
Let's get it right, go to the mall and tear up some tags
Then to my car, open my pants, clear up your tab
Fake hustlers understand why they mad at me
Why? Twenty year run started off with a half of P
Then I got a ki of D from the faculty
Bouffers that was bouffin'
Strong bladders, they never had to pee
And that ain't half of it, kilo's all in grandma's cabinet
Around the time M.O.P. was yappin' shit
You getting money say word, that ain't accurate
No promo, but no homo, I ain't jacking it, nigga

[Hook]
Coleslaw, ain't nobody seeing you
Coleslaw, no nobody wanna be with you
Coleslaw, nah, ain't nobody eating you
They misleading you, yeah mistreating you, nigga
Coleslaw, ain't nobody seeing you
Coleslaw, no nobody wanna be with you
Coleslaw, nah, ain't nobody eating you
They misleading you, yeah mistreating you, nigga
