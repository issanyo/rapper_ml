[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
At seven years old, had Lees -- they were pinstriped
At twelve, I had a knife for your windpipe
At thirteen, at the stash-house I spent nights
Could be wrong, but since fifteen, I've been right
At seventeen, I ain't care what my friends like
Nineteen was mean, I mean I had Hundred Ten Nike
Airs; twenty one became my money year
Twenty three, I could have been facing two hundred twenty years
Yeah, so let's celebrate, elevate
Roll the vanilla, fella; victory, hella cake
Man, y'all sweeter than Cream Savers, my team's major
O thirteen Range yeah it's a teenager

[Hook]
In the jungle, the mighty jungle

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Then animals that I grew up with
Boy, they'll stink, nigga
It's a few of us left
We'll leave you stink, nigga
Stink nigga, wash up -- you funky fresh
Dirty jeans, wack kicks
No cake, with monkey breath
No kicks, but a face dirty stress
A hundred K, twenty steps
Like the way honey dress
One year, one arrest
Tough charge, never met
Homicide, another death, another mother's son at rest
Mother made a motherfucker for my ranger breath
You get it to do it; man, you ain't done nothing yet
I could become a threat; calico, a hundred wet
Wanna bet? When I make it rain, your whole sun'll set
Doing a show? No prob, I'll book it for him
He ain't want the work, so I took it for him
Ribs, I cook it for him; I'll make you rich and famous
Ask Vato, Robin Leach, he lived for him

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm from where the strong prey upon the weak
Where the lions teach their babies bite before they grow they teeth
They say the world dog-eat-dog, huh?
Well, where I'm from, we all eat dog, bruh
Come from the jungle, learn how to hustle from hunger
Keep my money in bundles, keep a gun that's humungous
Predators are among us, oldest down to the youngest
We hunting, hope to be stunting, turning nothing into something
Get hundreds from going out of bounds, jackals throw a lot around
Trappers get the pounds and run 'em in and out of town
I'm from the A where quarter, halves, whole things you get
Get your paper straight, you like "Owimoweh, owimoweh"

[Hook]
