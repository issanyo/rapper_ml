[Intro]
It don't matter where I'm at baby
I'm well respected around the globe
Man word real niggas recognize real
Niggas I know what sounds old but it
Is what it is my nigga
Check me out though

[Verse 1: Cam'rom]
I still got my mansion off of south beach
Still do mansions on south beach
No V.I.P at the bar coke and vodka with my
Bitches and my niggas they from Opa-Locka
B got the choppa on the chain and B turn
The hamma put the choppa to ya brain
Nigga chief up all the piece hit the
Mooley in the gut any fool act a
Fool they keep cooley in the cut
Open up yeah homie you will be bitin'
The steal ma nigga boon a goon he
Got a licence to kill if you know me
Then you know what I'm writing is real
And we shoot only thing that we fight
Is appeals we vowed well cause we had
A viscous life stop one coco just a business
Night Monday K.O.D.S watch the bitches fight
You getting this and getting that
Go get a life

[Hook]
Mommy got it I said it
She drop it and bend it
Stop frontin' mother fucker
You got it spend it
Ooohhhhh
Countin' money baby

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Mommy a opportunist so she took
The opportunity asked me where I'm from
I said the crack rock community
Looked me in my face and said
Well that's nothing new to
Me, how many girls you got
In the city? two or three
Said do you, nah how about you
Doin' me you and this how you
Act cam, usually. Said she
Got fired need work ma frontin'
Told open my pants and go job huntin'
Not a lyricist also a novelist
Now get on your knees gimme that
Marvelous, and it was marvelous
Long neck ostriches, dick in her esophagus
Held my balls hostages
Dropped her off then I float
Around with birds of cane
What you expect?
I'm a low down dirty shame
Waddup big man
Sinking in quick sand
150 under the wrist man
Shit man

[Hook x2]
