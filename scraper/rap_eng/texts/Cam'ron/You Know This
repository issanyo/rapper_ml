[Intro:]
Yes, yes, yes!
I start the year alright
Yes, yes, yes!
Hmmm feels good, let's do it!

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
I do what I do but boo won't get a chicken dinner
Unless she kissed my wood you won't get a splinter
She agreed not surprised to...merked off
Not Jamaican but I gave her my jerk sauce
No ox tails, knew me for rock sales
She ain't drink liquor, but I gave her a cocktail
Gave me great knowledge, call it top Yale
You gonna make me come? She replied, "I will not fail!"
Hot damn, You're choking me, got damn!
Well treat my dick like some dice ..and shake the shit with ya hot hand
I could start a riot, you cannot deny it
Niggas talking loud, but they pockets quiet!

[Chorus]
The girl all on my zipper
In the club, baby more than the tipper
Oh, better yet man more than the strippers
As a matter of fact man more than the liquor!
What she say?
Hey, nigga you know this
Hey, and you know this
Hey, and you know this
You're so focused, I'm glad you notice!

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
In an average car, at the bar
On the dance floor smack, watch me grab a bra
But I still get fly, only without a jar
When the sun hit the jewels, turn to avatar!
Yeah, but in my pocket a ghost notes
No foes, dad will bring you there on a road boat
No joke, blow smoke, thought I had no hope
Then I copped the yacht guess I showed boats!
Yeah, guess I showboat
Catch me on a water baby, that's how hope floats
My chauffeur in Louis, my loaf is a Gucci
Tonight your girl and my dick will be hosting a Cuchi

[Chorus]
The girl all on my zipper
In the club, baby more than the tipper
Oh, better yet man more than the strippers
As a matter of fact man more than the liquor!
What she say?
Hey, nigga you know this
Hey, and you know this
Hey, and you know this
You're so focused, I'm glad you notice!

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Shawty got on a G shock, Reeboks
Let me outside the weed spot, peace trot
Crazy is what a her speech got... start to preach
Ease up, advice I need not!
Blow weed in a weave top, she shock
She look good, but that ain't why she hot
What you're smoking, please stop!
Please bitch, I'm cool with Dre.. but I ain't trying to detox
Cheap skates yeah they throwing cheap shots
We the clean up crew true... who floors need mop
You know how true it is, flyer than stewardess
Don't have to say who it is!

[Chorus]
The girl all on my zipper
In the club, baby more than the tipper
Oh, better yet man more than the strippers
As a matter of fact man more than the liquor!
What she say?
Hey, nigga you know this
Hey, and you know this
Hey, and you know this
You're so focused, I'm glad you notice!
