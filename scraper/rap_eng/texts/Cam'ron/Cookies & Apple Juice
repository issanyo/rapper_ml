Killa
Yo, I won't kiss her, maybe hug her but I don't even like her
I might get it, hit it, split it but yo, I'll never wife her
I'll Rowdy Roddy Piper but when she can't decipher
Love from fuckin', no fussin', buzzin', she out my cipher
Come through in a Viper, goddamn, I might white Nike her
Yeah, she straight, but get it straight, underestimate
I might just dyke her
You fight and fuss, wanna bite her, lock the girl down just like Rikers
I ain't gotta do that, once I hit your shit, the damn bitch's a lifer
This dude wanna write her, email, text and type her
He a runna, I'm a gunna, baby girl, a sniper
Roll the blunts up, ma, I'ma get the lighter
I'll have you squirtin' for certain, yeah, bring a diaper
Milk, lemonade, I'ma fuck around the day
Hand guns, hand grenades, meet me at center stage
Baby boy, go hire a squadron
My crib got more poles then a fire department
Cookies with some apple juice, cookies with some apple juice
I ain't mad at you, cookies with some apple juice
I ain't mad at you, cookies with some apple juice
I ain't mad at you, cookies with some apple juice
First lady so wavy
Lady of the birds, this is the Byrd Lady
Harlem standin' up, you know it gets crazy
No, I'm not your girl but I could be, baby
Yes baby, I'm sexy
Why you itty bitty girls wanna test me?
'Cause I fly high, floatin' with a jet speed
That's why ya man wanna sex me
Yup, he said I'm cute, tried to throw me in the loop
Hit me when he hungry, lick my cookies, drink my apple juice
Apple coupe, zoom zoom, horse your Porsche, vroom, vroom
Zoom zoom and not the poom poom
Smash real fast, got up out his room
Classy, yet I get nasty, nasty but never trashy
Bright light, yes bitch, I'm flashy, no, you will never pass me
Ask me, ask who, ask you, I'm sick, somethin' like a flu, flu
You stink, somethin' like a zoo, zoo
Lay low, you know what to do, boo
'Cause you don't want no problems, please trust, girl, I will solve them
4 5, yes, I revolve 'em, now it's hell up in Harlem
This for that Midwest, Down South, dirty, dirty
Bitches catch up, tie your shoes now, hurry, hurry
Cookies with some apple juice, cookies with some apple juice
I ain't mad at you, cookies with some apple juice
I ain't mad at you, cookies with some apple juice
I ain't mad at you, cookies with some apple juice
Milk, milk, lemonade, 'round the corner fudge is made
Cookies with some apple juice, I'm just tryin' to get paid
Milk, milk, lemonade, 'round the corner fudge is made
Cookies with some apple juice, I'm just tryin' to get paid
I said cookies and some apple juice, cherry jeeps, apple coops
No hassle, hit 'em with the gavel, ask 'em, my whole staff will shoot
What could the bastard do?
They run, we run this town, we'll run you down, they'll laugh at you
Damn no, look at mommy shakin' her derriere
Fuck Christmas, you could have a merry year
Where you wanna go? Everywhere, what you wanna do? Let me hear
I'm talkin' Vegas, I don't do them teddy bears
But I do, do the fishnets
Pre-ejaculation and get my dick wet
But I'm tryin' to get your lips wet
Doggy style, facial, huh, welcome to DipSet
Cookies with some apple juice, cookies with some apple juice
I ain't mad at you, cookies with some apple juice
I ain't mad at you, cookies with some apple juice
I ain't mad at you, cookies with some apple juice
Milk, milk, lemonade, 'round the corner fudge is made
Cookies with some apple juice, I'm just tryin' to get paid
