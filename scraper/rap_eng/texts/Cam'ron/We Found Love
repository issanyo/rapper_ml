East, West, South, Midwest.. let's go..

Y'all cheerleaders need pom-poms
I'm souped up: wonton
Chipped up: ?
Getting higher like Bron-Bron
I'm an artist like Ron-Ron
Long nose like a Long John
Look for me I'm long gone
Don P for the Don Juan

Gotta lock that
Lindsay Lohan!

I want em all young tonight
I know it's morning, but I'm saying goodnight

[Hook]

Her hair long, and her nails did
And her toes right, and she so fine
Her ass fat, her butt big
She got a man, but I don't mind
Her backside, I go cry
If she take it off, she don't whine
That slow grind that broke mine
That bedroom: we both shine..
