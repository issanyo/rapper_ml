[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Since B.I.G., bigger been better
Chicks, they trickin' for cheddar
Get the flip, flip the flip, flip at the flip of a feather
We whippin' whenever
Whips, we whip 'em through weather
Snow, rain, sleet, get it together, christmas in leather
I smell suckers here, your wife, I corrupt her ears
She go downtown, never come up for air
She a mermaid, since the third grade
Dirty used to serve treys tryna get a fur paid
Baby, do rep, but ladies, do step
8 to 80, come to my crib, I'm Baby Hugh Hef'
Jacuzzi, elevator, maid, two chefs
Gang on my hyph, Funk Flex, 100 2-steps
I go to people who can't hear with two breaths
And Russel Simmons and ask 'em all, who's deaf?
I been on the block since '90, who left
O.G.'s or old keys, living legend, true vet
I sell dope, sling crack, move X
Ex's, hallways, always, who's next
The chain is chunky too, color is Sunny Dew
Funky monkey, monkey see, monkey do

[Hook x2: Juelz Santana]
Once again it's on
This that middle finger music
Put your middle fingers up
Get your middle fingers moving
Middle finger who? Middle finger you
Middle finger who? Middle finger you

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
You find me the curb of the block
The nerve, I'm servin' to cops
He pulled his badge, dag, he deserved to get popped
Herb disturbing with pot, I rockin' the fur
Turbin, swervin', emergin', he certain I'm hot
I'm hurtin' it ahk, ya earth, she slurpin' my cock
Work on her, workin' her, purchase a knot
Let's get it perkin' in person, I got percs in stock
That's prescription pills, call me Mr. Pill
Or call me Brett Favre, I just skip through fields
5 to 8, 8 to 12, I done skipped some mils
I get chicks and chill, even that get ya killed
But mami, teeth fucked up, tell her fix her grill
Can't afford it, whoa, go get some bills
Suck my dick, no, not a lick until
No homo, this time lick and seal
My backyard Sea World, I got fish and seals
I'm just that deal, I would pitch and deal
Mission still with the steel, whatever not to miss a meal
Here come the frisk and feel
Put my wrist and steal
Before I leave, blow my weed on this biscuit steel
Now sniff that piff, yeah, smell that herb
Gotta melt it, word, get out my pelvis perv
Get the young'n's played, and the elders heard
You a turkey and a chicken, can't sell a bird ?
