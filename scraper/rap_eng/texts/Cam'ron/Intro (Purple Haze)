[Verse]
2 0-4 76, they wired my mom, couple weeks prior to Ja
Must've been the year of
Murderous killers, murderers that murder and kill for scrilla
O.G.'s with herb that guerilla, then turn
Mathemiticians, subtraction, addition
Division, to the packs and the cracks in the kitchen
Multiplication, rocks that I slash, precision
I gave a little more, few addicts were bitchin'
But in Harlem you get smacked up for livin'
That was a given, rock the hood
Pop the hood, gats in the engine
Clap up your women, accurate vision, Black, I'm just livin'
I'm the bomb but bombs get wrapped up in ribbons (Shiiit)
This the fact from the fiction, packs that I'm pitchin'
Cats in Maximum Prisons rattin' and snitchin'
Cause when Feds come, niggas mouths run
But the outcome, gon' be 'bout guns
Cause I don't bitch, and I don't snitch
I work hands on, fuck with Cam'ron
Cause I kept the grams in the boot
Damn, I would shoot but fam I would soup
Thought Cam was too cute to stand on the stoop
(What I look like?) My Spanish recruit, outlandish with loot
We got obsessed with Miami, cannons, and coupes
Baskin' in robbin', I'm laughin' and poppin'
It's all for Bloodshed though, I haven't forgotten
From the night to the days, my triflin' ways
I'ma bring that platinum plaque right to your grave, dog
You chill in the lobby, you feelin' this probably
You know me well, tear in your eye, chill in your body
Take it in stride, let's bake up these pies
Harlem, no homo, hop on and take this ride
To the top of the mountain
Bout to get this shit poppin' and bouncin'
Now that I'm down, the Roc is surrounded (Feel me?)
Afford all the best, but bought all the wet
Down with the Roc, but I'm loyal to my set (Dipset)
I know you niggas hate it
How I got Jimmy out of 5H, and my dog, Zeek situated
Santana is next...
