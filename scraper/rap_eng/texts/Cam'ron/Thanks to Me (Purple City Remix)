[Intro: Agallah]
You know, I'm from the grind you know
Guys gotta survive out here, I gotta get that guac up
I Gotta get that cake up, picture me not eatin fam

[Sin]
Yo
745, color peacan or lime
Butter peacan inside
Heat clap if you outta line
Bottom of the pot (geah), rise like ammonia (geah)
Hit the mottorola (geah), Sin whip up the cola
What these eyes seen, you can't envision
You get clapped and your fam miss you
You get jacked for that Expedition (muthafucker)
Load and fill up the clips
Squeeze and reload the shit, still ain't give up the whip
Ninas and 44's sing like Nina Simone
Heaters eat at ya bones, steam you with rachets homes
Kid was playin Menace, I was kitchen chemist
Number one with the most 'dro, crack and of course blow (Dip Set)

[Cam'Ron]
Ugh..
That's just what I sold though
Four Tops, four seconds
Four rocks, four buildings (four blocks)
Shout to the four building, it's like Fort Knox
And them bullets like free throws though, sure shots

[Hook: Bezel]
I show you how gangstas do, how gangstas be
How gangstas move, How gangstas speak
If this ain't gangsta, than what is gangsta b
Now everybody wanna be certifed, Thanks to me
I show you how gangstas do, how gangstas be
How gangstas move, How gangstas speak
If this ain't gangsta, than what is gangsta b
Now everybody wanna be certifed, Thanks to me

[Agallah]
Aiyyo
Yo the don is just lethal
Through the eyes of the people
They say the flow is always evil, ever since I was fetal
Legendary like Beatles, I'm a don like Siegel
The hottest shit up on the CD or up under the needles
Yo I talk to the reefer, and I talk to my ninas
They say I'm crazy, but hey it's just part of a genius
Yeah style is the meanest, y'all just startin to see us
Sellin out in stores, yeah I'm doin arenas
Yeah I'm servin that fever, ?? made 'em believers
Ride around with milimeters up in two seaters
With some new divas, and some new sneakers
I got so many furs, niggas call me Zoo Keeper

[Hook]
