[Cam'Ron: Intro]
KILLA!
Lemme tell you about my wifey real quick...
Had her wifed up... that's what's in and shit ya dig?

[Cam'Ron: Verse 1]
Yo she took me out my stinkin' aces, to the pinkest bracelet
Face it, the basics, no way you could think I'm racist
Got a white girl, tell you that she's quite thorough
Borough to borough, moved me through this white world (from what?)
From Colombia, then she moved to Canada
Now she live in Harlem, right, and you could say I manage her
Met her in '90, Jeru was the Damaja
I wasn't understanding her, everyone was a fan of her
That was confusing her, they was abusing her
That wasn't new to her, bought me a Luger brah'
Of course of course, we never had intercourse
Of course of course, without her wouldn't have been a boss
I would flip for my mama, got me getting them commas (get it?)
Paid for my 1st va-ca, a trip to Bahamas (YES!)
Swam in the ocean, I was dishin' piranhas
That's my girl girl, yup, so give her some honor

[HOOK]
POPPA HAD A DREAM
POPPA HAD A DREAM
POPPA HAD A DREAM
OOOOOOH, YES HE DIIIIIID

[Cam'Ron: Verse 2]
My pride and joy, called her butter
When she bake a cake, I told her we'd be lovers
She live with me right, I hide her from my mother
See she wouldn't understand I'm supplyin the gutta, nope
I let my baby hang outside with the brothers
Come back, cake on the bed the size of the covers
Shot 5 with a sucka, another 5 with a trucker
Took a hit without paying, get a dime for my butter
That's my homie my mama, second only to ganja
But I did watch her, play Tony Montana
Here's a quaalude, yep she'll be back
For them pesos, yep she'll be crack
Watch so bright, money so right
I got 7 workers, she's Snow White
And you know the steez, I'm at the ocean breeze
Killa Cam hand to hand with Coca Leafs

AND, and it's.........IT'S THEM BOYS
WE GET DOUGH
ASK A FIEND
CAUSE THEY KNOW

AND, and...........DON'T BE SHY
WHERE THE LIE
THAT'S THE WEED
WE GET HIGH
FA'SHO, DIPSET...............LET'S RIDE

[HOOK X3]

[Cam'Ron: Verse 3]
KILLA!
Magoo said that the bird's the word
But the fur byrd gang flip birds on curbs
And, it's ya homey thunny, I got a pony dummy
Phonies clone me, calm down I'm only money
Like Prince Akeem, you the servant Semmi
Living Martin's dream as I burn the hemi
Not concerned with many, got my girl here
When it come to money, shit I'm burning plenty

[HOOK]
