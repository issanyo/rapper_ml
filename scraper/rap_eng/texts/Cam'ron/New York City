[Intro: Cam'ron]
New York City
Welcome to Medina, the Mecca, the melting pot
Where you could be playin' ball or sellin' rocks
Tell the cops, they don't care
If you starvin', they won't share
All they'll say is, "Get your own, mothafucka'"
See the love isn't unconditional
A demonstration of unification is uncivilized
If you're ahead of the game, it's you they epitomize
But all these bright lights, how could you not visualize?
The Apple is rotten, but I love it

[Verse: Cam'ron]
We're in New York
42nd and Broadway, you'll see a play
142nd and Broadway, see the yay
I've written rules you follow, it's no need to say
They take your chips, I ain't talkin' no Frito Lay
We're in New York
No Allstate or Geico
But she got that money for lipo'
In the trunk, most of us got the rifle
Get your purse snatched from a psycho in
We're in New York
When I watched the towers fall
But nobody takin' ours, y'all
20 gunshots, call that a shower, y'all
Money, respect, don't forget the power, y'all
We're in New York
Certain beef you can't call off
So get holes in your body, like a golf course
Yeah, shotty to the brain
See you thought it was a game, but...

[Hook]
We're in New York City
We're in New York City
We're in New York City
When I watched the towers fall
We're in New York City
Nobody takin' ours, y'all

[Outro: Cam'ron]
We're in New York
When I watched the towers fall
But nobody takin' ours, y'all
20 gunshots, call that a shower, y'all
Money, respect, don't forget the power, y'all
We're in New York
Certain beef you can't call off
So get holes in your body, like a golf course
Yeah, shotty to the brain
See you thought it was a game, but...
