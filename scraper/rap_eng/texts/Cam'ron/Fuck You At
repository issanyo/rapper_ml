Move 'em in move 'em out
Trapped in shoot it out
Bone a whore
Corner store
Want it raw
On the floor
Tie 'em up lie 'em down
F**k yall niggas crying now
Killer Cam
Side town
F**k yall niggas ridin' round
Creep wit da toast
Keep it close
Never know when you'll see da gross
From my yaht you'll see coast
From my block you'll see toast
Love da way I grab dat cash
Now I laugh
You love the way I smack dat ass
Backflash
You'll sniff foul powder
Over clam chowder
Yall lil' rascals like Alfalfa
While we listenin' to wild salsa
La la bomba
Come through in the Hummer
La la bomba
Face down ass up
That's the way we like to f**k
After that pucker up
Babygirl we like to suck
Sucker what
Never duck
That's not what my hoods about
Hood without a doubt
So bitch put it in your mouth

Chorus
Where da f**k you at
Bust your gat
Where da f**k you at
Do yall niggas sell crack
Where da f**k you at
Got a fat stack

Huh, ain't a damn thing funny
Why? Bitch betta have my money
Where da f**k you at

Aiyo

Get get doe doe

Swing swing click click
Drug game big brick
Swing swing big dick
Pretty thing thick chick
Cock cock nice nice
Shot shot twice twice

Whips whips cost cost
Six six floss floss
Big big boss boss

Chorus

Aiyo I need da type of girl
That's in love wit her cash
Get knocked together
Look at each other and laugh
Get a key

Bitch caught him in da Rover
Scared 'em aired 'em

Goin' to da gun range
Her hobby is rape
Girls lookin' at her jewels

Plus a brand new jeep
Leather brand new seats
Wit da dishes real deep

Bang it out throw it back
Ain't no here we go wit dat
Grabbin' on here lower back
Lookin' at me like she can take the shit
Uh uh uh
