[Intro: Mariah Carey]
Just Blaze
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, mmm
(Boy, boy, boy, boy)

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I can't help it when I'm not around you (Boy)
'Cause all I ever seem to do is drift away in dreams about you
'Cause when I'm without you (Boy)
It always seems like (Boy, boy, boy, boy)
Part of me is missing, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Sometimes I don't call like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up and makes me smile
When I'm unhappy, all you gotta do is call
And suddenly things don't really (Boy, boy, boy, boy)
Seem so bad at all

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Boy) I need you (Boy), adore you (Boy)
I gotta have you (Uh, boy)
I wanna feel your touch, this ain't no little crush
So come and get my love, baby, anything you want
Feeling you (Boy), fiending for you (Boy)
Just waiting on you (Boy), when I see you (Uh, boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up inside my love
And never let you go, boy
Never let you go, boy (Boy, boy, boy, boy)

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
My heart races when my Motorola beeps or my cell rings
I just make a wish and if it's you my whole day changes
'Cause when I know you're thinking of me (Boy)
Heaven knows (Boy, boy, boy, boy)
Suddenly it's not so dismal, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Sometimes I don't call, like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up and makes me smile
When I'm (Boy) unhappy (Uh, boy) all you gotta do is call
And suddenly things don't really seem so bad at all
(Boy, boy, boy, boy)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Boy) I need you (Boy), adore you (Boy)
I gotta have you (Uh, boy)
I wanna feel your touch, this ain't no little crush
So come and get my love, baby, anything you want
Feeling you (Boy), fiending for you (Boy)
Just waiting on you (Boy), when I see you (Uh, boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up inside my love
And never let you go, boy
Never let you go, boy (Boy, boy, boy, boy)

[Verse 3: Cam'Ron]
Uh, mami feelin' my gangsta 'cause usually I stay on the block
But the girl wet whirl jet straight to the yacht
Eighth in the sock jewelry, chrome, and stones
Wow, it's Giles, Liles, Combs and Jones
Go to Capri and see my mami Mariah
Chanel glasses, hottie and fire, mami's a rider
She wants the (Boy), so I give her the (Boy)
Now she screamin' out (Boy, boy, boy, boy)
She want the hundred carat (Boy), the Harlem World (Boy)
Ma I'm a savage, better guard ya girl (Boy)
So c-c-c-c-c-c-call me and we'll start to cake up
Mark Jacob, you're a heartbreaker
Good (Boy) I'm a mobster and pimp
Eight keys, two hammers, lobster and shrimp
Look at my limp, mami we could be a couple still
(Boy-boy-boy-boy)
Sing my hook, help me sell a couple mill (Boy)
Now sing (Boy)

So come and get my love
Show me where it's at, now sing (Uh, boy)
