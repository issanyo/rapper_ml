[Intro: Cam'ron]
Killa, Psycho Drama, Twista
Chi-Town to Harlem, what's really good?

[Break: Yung Buk of Psycho Drama and Twista]
Part 2, what happens, when you combine the darkness, with the light?

[Verse 1: Yung Buk of Psycho Drama (Cam'ron)]
Yeah, I am more than compelled and honored to expel
This hell that's inside of my shell for fuckers who want it
Violence, yeah that bullshit right up my alley
Chasing you right up the alley
With a gun fixin' to kill you cause I feel you was the one
Fuckin' with my family (Psycho Drama)
I roll with a gang of go-getters, and them ghouls and them gorillas
Who be quick to put the Glock
Or the gauge to the gut of one of your niggas and pull it
(Psycho Drama)
The trigga and deliver you niggas these rigorous bullets
It's so rivetin' to see you livin' in vengeance sit up
And shrivel to pudding
Fuckin with niggas you shouldn't
These menaces and villains and hoodlums
That'll give you the business
And in an instant be diminishin' whoopin'
'Cause it ain't no type of jokin' or jivin' comin' off of this
You done somersaulted and dived in a coffin of shit
So if you ever get the notion to just motion forward
And get on some hoe shit
You niggas remember that I got that potion
To bore your brain in a bag
And give you a new perspective on who the realest y'all
(Psycho Drama) you just can't kill one you stupid bitch
You got to kill us all..

[Verse 2: Twista]
What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel
To make me wanna run up in ya home
Shoot you in the dome, if you bustin my body up with the chrome
I still'll be in the zone like Capone
Better leave me alone, cause I represent the city known for killin' motherfuckers
Makin' plenty money and layin' mack down
Cam, Buk and Twista spittin' gritty competition what a pity
You ain't fuckin' with it then put ya stash down
Come at the family you touched, uh
I'll shoot up ya V-12 even if you with ya female, huh
You was talkin' shit nigga wassup
Fuckin' up ya Sprewell's and ya new interior detail
And a nigga standin' too tall to fall, comin' so I hope y'all can crawl
Bloody up the vest all the wall
Sacrifice my body screamin' Kamikaze, I can take all of y'all...

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Y'all niggas play around, guns I wave around
Nigga better stay down, lay down, weigh pounds
Put 'em on the Greyhound, ride it up to K-Town (Chi-Town)
The boy get nasty 'til law enforcement blast me
Sawed-off and I'm happy, raw, where the crack be?
Put it right off of Pulaski
Cross street, don't need to be said
Code red, I already got beef with the Feds
Put three in ya head, from the street full of lead
Fuck knee-deep, you'll be six feet with the dead
Street sweeper when I creep creep, nigga fled (Flii-Flii)
When ya sleep sleep, nigga dead
Right on the back block, fight in the crack spot
Jackpot, ask not yes why not..

[Chorus: Twista (Yung Buk of Psycho Drama)]
(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh
(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make the trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass kick up the bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh
(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make the trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass kick up the bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

[Verse 4: Cam'ron]
Ya bitch is a hoe, she chill at the Rucker, you really a sucka
Big Will tryin' to grill her and cuff her
And Killa done fucked her, in love with the chick, the slut was a fish
Threw her bait, reeled her in and gutted the bitch
And now she, up in Pokip's, dick, huggin' the strip, slick
5th tucked in her hip, she will mug you for kicks
And word to, mother I'm rich, hit ya mother with bricks
Coke or ones you build buildings with, concussion the bitch...

[Verse 5: Twista]
Come and feel with the baller who's the nicest
And causin' the crisis
Got the ammo and agility that says rewind means growin' before
And this livin' and pause and this likeness
I can spit it for some who for nigga represent the call of the righteous
Or gang bang to the rhythm when I spit it
I'ma kill 'em with the technical precision
That'll be fuckin' up all the devices
Get sick with it like I'm lit off the wet
If it's beef, get the shit off ya chest
Don't take off ya vest, all my niggas make you jump off the set
And always get the prints of the TEC, straight off the deck
Mobbin' up and makin niggas duck
Knowin' I'll still open up the trunk, guns nigga we get 'em and bust
Murderin' the enemy is the ultimate adrenaline rush

[Chorus: Twista (Yung Buk of Psycho Drama)]
(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh
(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make the trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass kick up the bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh
(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make the trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass kick up the bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
