[Verse 1]
Now that I'm here niggas wanna wrap the ROC up
Nah, backslash wrap the rocks up, back the block up
Cop killers, clap at coppers, blast at choppers
Pass the vodka, listen, don't ever mention Dash or Hoffa
It's a Harlem thing dog, you'll clash with Mobsters (uptown)
Remember me? Got jumped on TNT (what's beef?)
Next week, back pump TNT (what's beef?)
All my niggas got M-16's kid
And all we do is watch MTV Cribs
Learn not to in fury the victim
Purially stick 'em, break through your security system (KILLA)
Stop frontin', you was never a menace
Never a hustla, NO, we could never do business
Business is business, money is money
Hustle is hustle, stupid is stupid
You da dumbest of dummies (Killa)

[Hook]
Leave me alone, let me just live my live, ah
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Let me just live my life ah
That's the sound of the police

[Verse 2]
All I do every day dog, blunt after blunt
Stunt after stunt, they all ?? after ??
Like that I'm Shiesty, look at my shoes, like my Nikes
Know that I got a girl, like my wifey, like that I'm rude
Come here, let me pick with your chest, dick on your breast
All they say "That nigga's a mess"
You heard me fam? All worthy of this dirty man
Take it in your ass? How about 30 grams ma'?
Go upstate, come back downstate, next time around me
You might get a POUNDCAKE, (screw that bitch)
Fuck it up, she understand that I might slap her
I'll me damned if I work for some white cracker (shit)
White batter, prize in the pack, fiends love
They hug it, call it Cracker Jacks, KILLA
Where the crack is at, watch me get dem dice
Throw 'em on, let me live my life

[Hook]
Leave me alone, let me just live my live, ah
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Let me just live my life ah
That's the sound of the police

[Verse 3]
Fuck life as a rap star, you dealing with crack gods
Cookin' the crack hard, lead the crack jars
All of the chips, the crib with the backyard
Pull out the gat pa, a bar, and black cars
And I'm scary with the 5th, compare me to a gift
Yellow diamonds, ganerrie on my wrist, just juice
Get wet up and waive, that'll be the day, killa cam
Mess up some yeah (shiiiiit), thug niggas be on point
And game time, cop a brick, and re-up in the same night
And to get that trife, I flick that knife, doggy dog
Let me live my life

[Hook]
Leave me alone, let me just live my live, ah
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Let me just live my life ah
That's the sound of the police

[Cam]
The block is hot, niggas tell me to feel it
Know when I get out they gon feel it
Witness the realest
