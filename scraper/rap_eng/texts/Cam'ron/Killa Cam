[Intro]
Killa
Bases loaded (uh huh)
Zeke on first
Santana on second (uh)
Jim on third (yeah)
I'm at bat
I'm about to hit this shit out the world! (whoa)
Killa, uh, Heatmakerz
Clap, sing, Killa
Clap, sing, clap, sing, clap, sing
Sing, clap, sing
Killa, Killa

[Verse 1]
With the goons I spar, stay in tune with ma
She like, "Damn, this the realest since 'Kumbaya'"
Bomaye, Killa Cam, my Lord (my Lord)
Still the man with the pan, scrilla fam, on board
Now bitches, they want to neuter me
Niggas, they want to tutor me
The hooligan in Houlihan's
Maneuvering's nothing new to me
Doggy, I'm from the land of grind
Pan pan: gram or dime?
Not tools or MC, when I say "Hammer time"
Beef: I hammer mine, when I get my hands on nines
If I had on 'Bama line, Corduroys, Cam'll shine
Canary burgundy: I call it "Lemon Red"
Yellow diamonds in my ear, call 'em "Lemonheads"
Lemonhead end up dead
Ice like Winnipeg
Gemstone, Flintstones
You could say I'm friends with Fred
You unhappy, scrappy?
I got Pataki at me
Bitches say I'm "tacky daddy"
Range look like Laffy Taffy

Killa Cam Cam Killa (Killa!)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm from where Nicky Barnes got rich as fuck
Rich and A hit the kitchens then were pitchin' up
Rob Base, Mase, Doug E Fresh switched it up
I do both, who am I to fuck tradition up? (Killa!)
So I parked in a tow-away zone
Chrome...I don't care
That car a throwaway, homes (Killa!)
Welcome to Harlem, where you welcome to problems
Off of furlough, fellow felons get pardons
Them niggas knew we bang
Stood out like Pootie Tang
Soon as the stoolie sings
That when the toolie sing!
Bang! Bang!
Came from that movie ring
Snap, crack jewelry bling
Flapjack, ooh he bring
Clack-clack, "ooh he ring!"
Bad rap, cuties cling
Ass cap, put them in the river
I'm the sushi king
And I'ma keep ya fresh
Let the fish eat ya flesh
Yes sir, please confess
Just say he's the best (Killa!)

[Chorus]
Killa Cam (sing)

(Let me end this shit, listen)
Killa Cam Cam Killa

[Verse 3]
(Killa!) Yo
How dope is this?
Teach you how to rope a chick
What you want: coke or piff?
Got it all, smoke or sniff? (everything)
And you know my drift
Used to figures, dough and shit (millions)
You a rooster nigga, just a roaster, bitch
And I roast ya bitch
That's how it usually ends
Tell her and her groupie friends
Go get their coochie cleansed
We the moody Gucci, Louis and Pucci men
Escada, Prada
The chopper it got the Uzi lens
Bird's-eye view
The birds I knew flip birds
Bird gangs, it was birds I flew
And word I blew off herb I grew
I would serve on stoops
Now swerve in coupes
It's me, sing! Killa, uhh
