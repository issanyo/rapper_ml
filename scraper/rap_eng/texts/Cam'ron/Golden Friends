[Hook: Cynthia Fee]
Thank you for being a friend
Travelled down the road and back again
Your heart is true, you’re a pal and a confidant

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Killa season has returned y'all
Wanna say thank you
To that cocaina
That coke I got off the boat
That I made float, then copped that Beamer
Over her I cock the Nina
Load the 9 or swerve the Tommy, and yes, I love her
Got my mother out the gutter, word to mommy
Where your real friends at?
Poverty, put an end to that
You ain’t got it, they don’t come around
Only come around for your income tax, but...
Shout your homeboy or your homegirl
That know your game
That let you hold they car
Claim the kids, put your phone in they name
True, they're along for the ride with ya
Even when you’re dead wrong
Right by your side with ya
In the club, bump, ya'll pose for the right pictures
Somebody act, they're down to fight with ya
I held his kicks, he let me hug his chicks
Oh, pardon me y'all I’m just talkin 'bout Huddy 6
So if you're with your girlfriend, wake up your eye
And if you're with your homeboy, put a drink in the sky

High fives (high fives)
High fives (high fives)
High fives (high fives)
Now tell 'em this...

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Thanks to British, he’s some other guy, word
We make mothers cry
Had to sing their sons a lullaby, whoa
Alibis, alibis, we kept more than one
Wet T-shirt, no water gun
He a business man, now all are young (yes, he is)
Grandma raised me, Lennox Ave took it over, though
Thanks to Zekey, he kept my pockets on overflow
Un gave me my first deal, Benz gave me my first wheels
But thanks to Hector Garcia Sr. – gave me my first meal (gracias, papi)
Wanna thank God, my Lord and savior looking over me (looking over me)
Thanks to Tanya, for years I tore up her ovaries (what up, girl?)
Thanks east, west, north, south, overseas (Peru)
No thanks to these rats that think you owe'em cheese
But you're with your girlfriend, start swinging your hair
If you're with your real piece, put a ring in the air

[Bridge]
High fives (high fives)
High fives (high fives)
High fives (high fives)
Now tell 'em this...
