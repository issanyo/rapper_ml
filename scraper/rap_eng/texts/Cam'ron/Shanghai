Shut the fuck up punk!
You fuckin' faggot! I'm tired of this shit!
You feel sorry for who?

Gave you head before I stormed in
And the problem..muthafucka yo I want in!
Oh I play to win!
Every mornin
I'm yawnin
While y'all are born in and sworn in, In the store you fake bringing the corn in...
Meat, rice, and poultry
I know how you get your money
Don't insult me
Shutup
For me not steppin
You can fault me
Yeah, I chilled
But we are about to split this muthafucka
Like SugarHill
Oh your man
He thinks he's wise
Tell him chill
He ain't the only one with chinky eyes
Yo, I relate to him
And I'll put eight through him
When I skate to him
And my co-d
I don't think you know whats taped to him
But think Oklahoma
I'll have this whole fuckin store with that smoke aroma
And yo, your wife keeps twitchin
Than we both can bone her
Real quick, real sick
Pull out dick
Nigga go on and rip
I'll turn this whole fucking clip into some O-Dogg shit
Close that gate
It's time to negotiate
Now your store...kills em! It fulfills your needs... you got Now and Laters...Seeds... nigga Lee Dungarees
We in the middle of Harlem
What we need for them ski's
That's the coverup nigga
For the weed, guns, and keys
No its no time to cry yo... yall getting live yo..
I just wanna get paid off, nigga
Like five-0

In America the product is coke and weed
In China, the product is dope and speed
The Columbians got the coca leaves
But in Harlem, niggas like to Plot and Scheme

[Cam'ron]
Now your store gross
A mil' a week
And my niggas on the block
Yo, we feel is sweet
But we been livin here forever
Can you feel our beef
So give us half
Or I guarantee baby
You gonna feel the heat
And I'm a little bit high
Save a little and you die
Send a blizzard through your store
In the middle of July
So if you wanna chat
We can
If you wanna scrap
We can
But I feel like Jackie Chan
Exactly man
The Don grew
Murder thoughts like John Woo
I'm here for Bi
Not to calm you
Now it's a done deal yo
There ain't no bluffin kid
And tell your wife don't move
I know where that button is
Yo, I would hate to have to bust her
That's petty black
Matter of fact I know yall
I know where that machete at
Give me that
Blamm!!!
That's when the chink had flipped
Then grabs me like Spock
On some Bruce Lee shit
And his wife had a grenade
That's when my niggas sprayed
And in a puddle of blood
Is where that bitch laid
Yall ain't got to sweat me yo.. now you see that we for real nigga LET ME GO!! Fuck up off me!!
Realize Im the loose one
Next time, your ass gonna play Bruce son
That's Word to mutha!
You don't know how deep we are
Give me them tapes
Ya'll got VCR's
Yeah, three of 'em
But back to the topic
My deal to the floor
In a week
I can bring about 10 thou to the store
Yeah, I know I know I know
That's not near to what your crew had
But we doin this together
Nigga that's too bad
Now here's the deal either take it or leave it
Cause see these guns
We can take it or squeeze it
And you know that Im that type
And my shorties.. they'll be here some time tonight
You know Ninya, the ninja wit China white?
They got some shit that will fuck around and blind your sight
They kind of tight
Now if I here things behind the hype
I'll put a contract on your life
And I'mma sign it right
The thirst way
So have my money Thursday
Cause I don't want to have to see your ass nigga on herse day
In the worst way
