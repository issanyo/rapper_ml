See my eyes, rolled up right now, I'm facin three to five (In Jersey)
Assault charge yeah granted, it was aggrevated

Don't catch feelings man, how she not feelin Cam?
And look her by the waist feelin like a ceilin fan (Crazy)
My girl Chanel should sell shit 'for Chanel kicks hell
Split turn down 50 mill, on my Chappelle shit
Get your ice wet, lay down that slight bet
Word my word heard you'll get curved like a Nike check

Queens stories heard 'em all from Preme to Ronnie Bump
Waitin on that four door Porsche should be out in a month

[Verse Four: Cam'Ron]
With these keys I'm a wilderbeast, Nautica feel the fleece (Come feel it)
I should shoot at the ground the way I kill this beat
No seatbelt but ma, I'll unfacin it
Jag Coupe is lavender, today I'm playin passenger (Shotgun)
