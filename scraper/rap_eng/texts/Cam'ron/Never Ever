[Verse 1:]
Yo I, Drive on the Parkway, Park in the drive way
I had a hard day, I'm on my parkay
I said I thought a brother nothing like Park Aye
No I'm not Rico, but I'm definitely suave
Aye, so parlay, I'll let the pigeons know
I fuck em top speed, knock kneed pigeon toed
I leave em bow legged, tell her relax dear
Louis bucket, Louis luggage, I'm leaving don't ask where
I had the 2011 thing last year
Psychologist, gynecologist, here's a pap smear
Is that clear, I'm feeling bad as ever
Honey LV purse, eww patent leather
I'll have her like hmmm..., she make me say mahhhh...
I'll have her like ooohhhh...Then I make her say ahhh...
Never mind the phonies, you looking kinda lonely
I want to be Ginuwine, can I grind that pony

[Hook]
Ya'll never ever ever ever could live my life
(life girl, live my life, life)
Ya'll never ever ever ever could live my life
(life girl, live my life, life)

[Verse 2:]
Yo I, play with a rough stay, I sold enough ye'
I'll never stop eating though, this game is like a buffet
I must say, I get the dust moved
Cock blocks, chopped rocs, yeah call it Krush Groove
You wouldn't do diddly digga, my delivery
Is better than a mail man, you never seen misery
Seriously, on the other hand visibly
You might know my neighbor Walt (Walt who?) Disney
(Disney) Yeah Disney, coke cakes, pot pies
No chicken in it cuco pollo be on fa-fire
Old ladies gossip, they get up early doggie
You see what happen to daddies boy
Yeah you was trying to kick it,  you got your moms evicted
Now everybody looking at you (now that's a God damn shame)
They made at you, cuz you went and took the drama route
Llama out, and you had the work up in your mama's house

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Yo I, I hit the dealer, then the dealer hit the stoop
Then I hit the dealer, leave the dealer with a coupe
Pick up mami, she said "you wanna hear the truth"
This car is hot Cam, but where's the roof
I said ma, it's no top, I do this
She said "oh you like Eazy-E, roofless"
I said true this, phone rings, who this
Smooth rick, tooth chip, a nigga need a few bricks
Drop shorty off, so I can show em some
He cop four, so you know I had to throw her one
Cuz my teammate green off the payroll
We turned yayo, to fettuccini alfredo

[Hook]
