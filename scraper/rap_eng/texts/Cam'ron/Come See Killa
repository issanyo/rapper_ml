See Duke
It's two type of niggas
It's niggas that do the talking
And the niggas that they talk about
I'm the nigga that they talk about
And it's unfortunate
Due to the circumstances of your tax bracket
You don't comprehend half the shit that's going on
Stop chasing me and chase the mothafuckin money
Oh I forgot
I am the mothafuckin money (ha ha! )
-verse 1-
Yeah
The Five is amazing
One question, why would you race him (why?)
Ride wit Jamaicans, slide wit the Haitians
Pies we bake 'em, lives we take 'em (take 'em)
That's right, cyberspace (space)
No wire fiber you can trace (nope)
Yall know what happens when a bear comes out of hibernation (Grrrrrr)
Pick up Sanaa Lathan
Try to embrace her, fly with the statements
Live from the pavement, slide wit the bacon
Guns in the ceiling, pies in the basement
Eight shots, why would I waste 'em
Eight digits my equation
Bring the Hummer through, not the number two
But I bet this number Nine will erase him
A buncha crybabies
I'm fly, baby
And fuck the traffic, I'm still trafficking on I-80 (Daytona)
Getting back from Arizona
In a car with bad aroma
Make it look pretty, I make it to city, this weed'll put yo ass in a coma
Got class, no Diploma
Just ask, I'm the owner
Get your girl a glass of Corona (and)
And watch how fast I bone her
Am I offending yall
With my spending yall
I'm sorry, Yellow Ferrari
That's the Lemon oil
Lookin' through the headlights, runnin' through the red lights, fuck it I'm dead nice
The time this song is over, it'll be on every website (goddamn)
I'm a psycho, HELP (help)
End your life gone well
I Put him in the ocean, tell 'em start swimmin'
Hurry up Michael Phelps
Ain't no gold medals, (Nope)
Just some Rose Gold (Ice! )
Y'all niggas gone old (Damn! )
Drinkin' 'Old Gold' (Shit! )
Got the vest and the chrome, I'm Rocky like Sylvester Stallone
Phone home, goddamn, yall shoulda left him alone! (Killa! )
When the smoke right
And the dope nice
And the coke price, is low like your hoe wife
Come see Killa (yeah)
Come see Killa (yeah)
Come see Killa (yeah), we'll get skrilla
When you can make bail, or escape jail
Come to my block, Ahk, I'm having a cake sale
Yeah it's Killa (Yeah! )
Yeah it's Killa (Yeah! )
Yeah it's Killa (Yeah! ), I get skrilla
-verse 2-
Doggy, don't play foul
With that old fake smile
Play with me, you'll be on A&E:'Cold Case Files'
Y'all know I won't lay down
Go straight rounds
Okay clown
Throw cake around, I'm like a earthquake, I hope they hold they ground
Try to crush in the Blue thing, like Mac 10 we rush and we 'hoo bang'
I'm from 40th nigga, I sold dust to your set
Sold coke to your moms, got it from Miami
Gave Mitch Green three bundles after that eye jammie
Sold liquors
Sold Blickers
Sold some houses too
Sold crack, sold hoes, sold pounds, sold pills
They were powder blue
Powder too
Our crew will shower you, in a hour or two
I'm puffin' on piff
Taste delish
But I sell that sour too
You know how I do
Mami like 'nah ' nah boo
Shut up and take this dick, you make me sick with the 'ah ah oooh'
How can I lose?
Four thou for the shoes
Twelve thou for the wooz (that's liquor)
Eighty thou on a cruise (boat!)
Nine hundred thou on the jewels, wait
No, in fact a Million
That chain a Hundred thousand that I gave to Katt Williams (what up Katt?)
That's my jigga nigga
What up Mofarelli?
The shit I'm brewing up, I swear it's gonna hurt they bellies
They gon be sick of me
No help from Penicillin
It's time to get it straight, and separate the men from children
Got the Benz wit the rims, the Tims wit the brims, my fitted hat
A Black Sheep, yo
Get wit this or get with that!
When the smoke right
And the dope nice
And the coke price, is low like your hoe wife
Come see Killa (yeah)
Come see Killa (yeah)
Come see Killa (yeah), we'll get skrilla
When you can make bail, or escape jail
Come to my block, Ahk, I'm having a cake sale
