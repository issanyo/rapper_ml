[Verse 1: Sen City]
You want one or two bricks?
Blocks of straight fish?
Okay the truth is
I don't know you
A small town that gotta itch
I'm there when you need a fix
I could show you a thing or two

[Bridge: Sen City]
It go up, it come down
Drive around and find me
I mean dime after dime
Got the fiends and they sniffing the finest
I mean line after line

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Lenox terrace was my stash house
Right by the bath house
Moving yay twice a day, had 'em bringing cash out
Hefty bag? Nah they wasn't bringing trash out
Like that posse out in Brooklyn we would mash out
Body builder I be slinging weight around
Tell Ben Affleck I got something to wake the town
See I made it 'round, yeah make it round
25 wholesale, 43 you break it down

[Chorus: Sen City]
Let us know cooking low I don't need consignment
I'm going dime after dime
Corner stoops get the coupes yellow bones piling
I'm going dime after dime
Yeah, the fiends gon' be waiting
Dime after dime
Yeah, the fiends gon' be waiting
Dime after dime

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
The aux'll cut you, cops'll cuff you
Blocks are rough too, Lenox Ave
Broads get snatched up, dudes get clapped up
The whole neighborhood trapped up, your Lieutenant grab
Soon as I came down weigh pounds
Hitting up the same town lay down
By any means, AM track, Peter Pan
Greyhound made round
I'll sold it anywhere
Walmart, project building, playground
I'll be everywhere
West, Midwest, up North, way down
But you will respect me, still protects me
Still come check me, no wholesale
You can't dissect me or redirect me
Don't talk directly or no sale

[Chorus: Sen City]
Let us know cooking low I don't need consignment
I'm going dime after dime
Corner stoops get the coupes yellow bones piling
I'm going dime after dime
Yeah, the fiends gon' be waiting
Dime after dime
The fiends gon' be waiting
Dime after dime
