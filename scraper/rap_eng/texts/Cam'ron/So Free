-We ain't the usual we more than that crew that bang
This is s.a.s. DipSet Euro gang
This is east to west north south movin thangs
This is stretch cash comeback like boomerang
This is london, no not the dungeon
This is lump sum shuttle rocks in abundance
This is street life, and its deep riiighht?
When the 3 strikes hit ya chest like a reef high

[Hook]
All day long I sling, I'm so free like the song I sing, I'm soo freee likeee
Alex Haley retracing his roots
I'm free, like the haze in the booth inhale it then POOF
I'm free like a mixtape rapper that just ain't known
Free like a right hand man that just came home I'm free
I'm free like somethin for nothin and I'mma keep on stuntin and frontin
I'm so freee like

[Mega]
You had enough yet?
I had a thug rep, way before New York. the drugs and the blood sets
And I get love fuck this industry, I'm reppin every nigga in these streets
So scream at me
I been known braggin ..with Jim Jones flaggin in that new benzo wagon
I won't stop makin heads bop in this zone
The watch face full of bedrocks and flintstonesss I'm gone

[Mayhem]
Do you believe that you free from this earth?
Like a still born seed when conceiding its birth
Until I reach in the shirt you deep in the dirt
You can't rest in peace till you sleep in a hearse (r.i.p.)
Seek and you find, look bruv i'll reach you in time
And for my brehs locked in the box for free in their mind
Right now I'm freeing my mind my season to shine
This year I shuck rocks in the block I'm deep on my grind and all I say is

[Hook]

[Mega]
Slowed you haters, show you the old school vapors
Niggas please shit I'm free like the local papers
Vocals greater, I don' believe in these guys
Shit I hunger the truth but they feedin me lies
Sick to my stomach so I spit sicker than vomit
I'm free like "here bruv take a hit of this chronic"
And as they blowin the L I show them as well
We gonna make it to heaven cuz we goin through hell so yell
That I'm free...cuz I'm free....KIllA..S.a.S.....euro.....DipSet..lets go

[Cam'Ron]
I was twirled in refered to a whirlwind
Grew up in a world when, you do wrong thurl gems
Thats why long as the world spin
That bentley with the engine and the trunk from berlin, I'm curled in
Smirkin, seats is sherlin, surely I'm sure shit shorty tell ya girlfriends
In traffic jammin with pearl rims
Its magic magician I'm Merlin

[Hook]

[Cam'Ron]
But in the hood, I can tell you the saga
To eat theres beef on the menu theres drama
But you punksters pumpin y'all ain't punkin me
With car cables y'all still ain't jumpin me
You had the 9 the AK a garbage truck
Took a shit shit you still wouldn't dump on me
All the hatin they statin nothin get done to me
I still sit comfortably
Tell niggas nothins Free..KILLA
