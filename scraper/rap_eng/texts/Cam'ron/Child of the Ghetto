[Intro]
Let's do the Eastside one time
Metro North, East river, Wilson, Club 99
Jefferson, Charleston, A.K., Jackie Rob, Clinton, Taft, Carver
Lakeview, 1990, Wagner, Taihino, Harlem

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
I don't care if you a old head, or a young buck
I'm not a elevator, I'm no come-up
Nor do I go down, do like Brand Nubian, slow down
Whole clique, blow pounds
Silencers steady, that's no sound
Circle ya block ock, merry-go-round
Here we go now, I'm the owner
You the pitcher, this block is your mound
Buildin' a beast so villains can eat
I reside on the West, chilled on the East
If I say that I rock, then sayin' is gossip
I lived in the nine, stayed in the projects
Scored 39 then I wait for a profit
Taught, pull the 9 then I spray up a object
Homie, don't confuse me, pardon mine
I'm the Harlem World Karlton Hines
Get it right nigga

[Chorus: G Dep sample]
A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin' the scripture the picture they painted for me
Knew what it wasn't, it wasn't to gain a degree
Rippin' and runnin', they gunnin' and aimin' for me
A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin' the scripture the picture they painted for me

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Killa, uh, uh..
I don't really buy jewelry, I take 'em
I don't listen to artists dog, I break 'em
I don't really look at movies, I make 'em
I'm filet mignon, and you a steak-um
Any beef, I'ma open it probably
I got some dudes hopin' ya try me
I got hoes, sell coke in a lobby
I'm rich bitch, sellin' dope is a hobby
You peepin' at candy, heat did they hand me
I be in the Lamby, you with your family
Talkin' gangsta, the church ya visit
You're roller bladin', circus and picnics
The underworld, the circuit I live in
You keep your biscuit, we're workin' with chickens
That's the rules that were laid to me
Why you think they call me KFC
You don't know me homie

[Chorus: G Dep sample]
A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin' the scripture the picture they painted for me
Knew what it wasn't, it wasn't to gain a degree
Rippin' and runnin', they gunnin' and aimin' for me
A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin' the scripture the picture they painted for me

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Killa, Killa..
'91 to '96, yeah Harlem was out
Grant's Tomb, balled out in Laguardia house
Huh, stand in the lobby, Cam and his posse
Steak and cheese sandwich from Heaugies
It come to her-on, the biggest of Dons
Since, Guy and Nicky, Fisher and Barnes (snitch)
Triggers and bombs, hit the alarm
I would, kick in the door, click on ya moms
I fell to the arm, in jail we roasted
If bail was there, bail got posted
Like, in Boston at one point boo
The bail it was 1 point 2, get the money nigga

[Chorus: G Dep sample]
A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin' the scripture the picture they painted for me
Knew what it wasn't, it wasn't to gain a degree
Rippin' and runnin', they gunnin' and aimin' for me
A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin' the scripture the picture they painted for me
