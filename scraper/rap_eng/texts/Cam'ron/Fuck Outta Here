[Verse 1]
Uhh, uhh
Your bullshit, I ain't in the mood for it, mama
So through the sunroof of the coupe where I holla
I never get used to this guala
I grew up on anything that was 2 for a dollar
Blunted with some hash
Because I stunted on my past, fronted on the cash
Every car I bought in the last ten years had two hunnid on the dash (What else please?)
Your baby mother been labeled a hoe
All my niggas they say she the GOAT
Call her cocaine, 'cause she was able to blow
I ran through her like The 6, I made her say "woah!"

[Chorus]
I see the hate in your rhymes (Oh, you mad?)
No, this is not a surprise
You a chicken nugget nigga with salt on the fries
All you do is drink, gamble and come up with lies

[Refrain]
("Fuck outta here" vocal sample x6)

[Verse 2]
I had some tough luck with dice
But left tucked up the ice
Then ordered some duck and rice
I ain't nothing nice
Shorty, 21, said I'm the love of her life
Girl, stay away from me, I will fuck up your life
Shit
The mall dame is my ball game
Aw mayne, he's buyin' denim from Balmain
Two G's, the small change, they all lames
Beef by taking the ten, I call names
I'm a piece of work but I'm feeding the streets some work
Need some work?
Come and meet me, homie
We can meet the first
Swallow your pride, you wouldn't be the first
Your girlfriend need a purse, her girlfriend need it worse (Woah)

[Chorus]
I see the hate in your rhymes (Oh, you mad?)
No, this is not a surprise
You a chicken nugget nigga with salt on the fries
All you do is drink, gamble and come up with lies

[Refrain]
("Fuck outta here" vocal sample)
