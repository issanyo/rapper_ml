[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
They call me broke goose, up on me

So girl... Yeah you boo, let me introduce you
To a new crew, not familiar, ain't what you used to
Hit Aruba, put it on YouTube
Let your ex-man see your new dude
And new purse, and new shoes
Tell em I win, aha you lose
Dice game I full up the bank
Yo ex-man can’t full up your tank
Damn that's mad trife, talking bout the gas price
All I do is look and say damn that's a sad life
He baked beans just add rice
No soft drinks, just mad ice
Now you waiting in the cold for the bus
Girl come roll with the rush... us!
