Get from 'round me

[Jha Jha]
I'm the definition of, half lady half thug
Half crazy, half hazey puffin on them drugs
Half dizzy, half sizzy, sippin' on syzurp
Half rich, cuz you kno ya girls a hustla
I got my money up, now I can pop shit
Still hit that purple punch, fuck a style-Cris'
Fuck from round here, bitch I got a wild clique
Thought that you was poppin' off before, what now bitch
I'm one up on you hoes, I don't fuck wit you hoes
Phony bitches I will DUMP on you hoes
I ain't a spotlight chick, I stays on the low
Keep my money on my mind and my mind on my dough
And I roll right, Dro tight you kno that flow like no other
So gutta, You gotta fuckin love her
They gotta fuckin' love her, look how them jeans hug her
Playa hatas suck a dick all you cock suckas

Now when I roll up to the spot you'll know
See the escalades wit the spades 24's
I'm doin' big thangs, now I got a lot to show
I still ain't content homey I gotta get mo'
How I know bitches talk behind my back when they ain't round me
Gossip tellin' lies on a chick when they ain't round me
Even try and let my man hit when they ain't round me
Then act like everything is perfect when they get around me
I'm a top notch bitch, you about a piece of shit
Yo net worth is zilch, up yo game a couple bricks
I up my game 80%, you can tell by the wrists
Went from walkin' everywhere to shotgun in the 6
I'm bout to bomb me a bitch, go Sadaam on a bitch
Blow yoself to smitherines, goin' strong on them hits
On a high speed paper chase, no time to hesitate
Y'all bitches ain't down, ain't holdin no pounds, get out my fuckin' face
