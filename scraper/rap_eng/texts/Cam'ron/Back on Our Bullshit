[Verse 1:]
On a Grammy, a baby maw on ma dick, no battery
Girl I been there, you can stop taggin me (please!)
We do different things, so we in different places
We pop guns, bottles, models and naked faces (word)
I’m in Gucci, Louis, an MCM
On a Thursday, I’m your bitch, MCM
Shit, let them be them, I put it em back like empty 10
Extendo clip, nigga wid a attitude
Where d fuck is MC Ren?
Customers, send em in, I treat em all like gentlemen
Artistes or the athletes, doctors, lawyers and savvy men
Guns, barkin nigga, quit your barking nigga
So far wit no cars, believe me I will park a nigga! (uh)
You could call me the valet! (word)
I get boat loads of wild yay
Mr West Swidda, it been a wild year
Your music is tough but dem skirts is wild gay

[Chorus:]
Uh-huh,uh-huh, back on our bullshit
Yea, yea, back on our bullshit [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Hold up, hold up, hold up!
We dem boyz!
Hit d dealership wit 2 hunid K, leave wid a toy, nigga
Some goop fuck yo girl one time, let d block have her ( I don’t want her)
Went at d ones in d strip club, threw ma watch at her
I’m in d kitchen bakin cakes, Betty Crock batter
Press a button, lose my roof, I got top matters
I’m in love wit ma Glock, you in love with a thot
Had dat bitch suckin dick when Cam drops suck it or not
AK, big beretta guns, niggas betta run
Diamonds come from Africa, where Nelson Mandela from
We’re rouga, Ferragamo store, going hella dumb
Stomp dis lil nigga out until d paramedics come
Oh yea, you got a gun wid a body on it?
I take it from you an you’ll be d next body on it
I bought a lot of watches, crashed a few v’s
Had a ass on two knees for a bag wit 2 C’s
Yea!

[Chorus] [x2]
