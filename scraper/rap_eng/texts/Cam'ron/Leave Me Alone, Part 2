BITCH! Uh!

(Leave me alone.. I just like to live my life)
Part 2!

[Verse 1]
I be like Move.. get out the way
Cuz I move bricks, get out the yay
And it's 2 clips, I get out the play (man!)
Fo a few chips, I get out n' spray (bla-kow!)
It's more then shrimps, it's whores and pimps (pimps)
The difference in our crimes, yours attempts
Attempt burglary, attempt theft you just begun
I'm Grand Theft Auto, rackets here, larceny, conspiracy
Murder one, electric chair I don't deserve the fun
But I get the dough, shit I might splurger one
Now I know a lotta styles, some see
But listen, stop it child it's a done D
I come to ya block, stop and style it's that one V
Gators straight from +Crocodile Dundee+
No rubber sold, hardwood bastard
Fitted, legitted, hardwood classic
Killa! Uh!
(Leave me alone.. I just like to live my life)

[Verse 2]
Uh, that shit you talk don't move me nada
The dudes with the Q's be proper
Uzi pop, you news and choppers
It's true we lava, who knew we'd prosper
The game's a bitch, ooh we got her
Shoes, Louie product groupies blah blah
Santana, Zeke the kufi poppa
We the movie SHOTTAS
But it's really rude bois and rastas
With a +Trailer Load of Girls+, excuse me Shabba
I wish my homie could watch me
Live +Happy Days+ like Tony and Chachi
I stay lonely and cocky
(DICE!!!)
Rollin' and rollin' 'em
Cars, the repo are towin' 'em
Acts black, we totally total 'em
Even blood, he totally totaled it
Plus his life, he totally totaled it
But any girl I get I totally open 'em
Brain in they legs, coke and the dope in 'em

[Bridge]
Killa!
Talkin' tough? (Yo!), smokin' dust (Whoa!)
Fuck with us? (No! No! No!)
Get ya head bust
Get ya head bust
Fuck around dawg, get ya head bust
He talkin' fly (Yo!), I wonder why (Whoa!)
Fuck with us? (No! No! No!)
Get ya head bust
Get ya head bust
Fuck around dawg, get ya head bust

[Verse 3]
Killa! Yo uh..
(Leave me alone.. I just like to live my life)
I spend days on kawasakis
Nights with Lewinskies
But I'm the like the Ice Man, Richard Kuklinsky
I style on New York, pile up my fork
The Dips, consulted by the son of Malachi York, doggy
Cause I push weight, plus I push tapes
God damn I'm starvin' and I just ate
I wouldn't say I'm meano with +Tha Carter+
I'm more like the plant in +Little Shop Of Horrors+
But I don't say "Feed me Seymour"
I say, "Feed me Dame, feed me Lyor" (billions!)
Epic, they used to feed me detours (pfft!)
Roc-A-Fella, they feed me C-4
The way I blow up, the VS just soars
You GS-3, I'm GS-4
You in a lexus, I'm Gulf Stream 4
Up in the sky, on a gulf stream tour
You want beef? We'll start a Gulf Stream war
Lay ya ass down on God's Green Floor
We playin' Golf in the Gulf Of New Mexico
Tha Cost to be the boss, you gotta respect it, ho
My gas game you gotta respect it tho
I swear to god you think I'm workin' for +Texaco+
And ya section know when any day Techs could blow
Hit 'em from neck to toe when I come deck ya hoe
Killa! DipSet Bitch!
