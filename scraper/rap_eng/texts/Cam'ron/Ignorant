[Intro: Mac Miller]
Whoop!
Had to throw one of those in there, uh
This that motherfuckin' millionaire music, ya feel me?
Chya

[Chorus (Extended): Mac Miller]
You can't believe it, this ridiculous, belligerent (Whoop!)
Oh my bad, I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit (Whoop!)
A girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch (Whoop!)
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant (Let's go)
You can't believe it, this ridiculous, belligerent (Whoop!)
Oh my bad, I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit (Whoop!)
A girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant (Whoop!)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, so I just bought another Rolie and that shit is Goldie Hawn
Better get it before it's gone because my shop been open long
I stay smokin' on that strong, I'm smokin' on that strong
Then go and take a handful of drugs, what the fuck is goin' on?
Bein' rich? well that's fun as hell, these bitches come like they under spells
Yo Mr. Jobs you see I'm a Mac, but I'm rollin' deep like Adele
I'm Robert Downey Jr., you more like Steve Carell
So get smart, no head starts, put a Lion on a Gazelle
You tryna rhyme 'cause you idolize what I design for myself
But it's hard to find these bars of mine, so Columbine yourself
I don't hate ya bitch, just fakin' rich, I get paper like grades at Cambridge
I'm best friends with my banker shit, gave her fifty racks just to make a wish
Brand new crib I'm paintin' it, half a mil, just paid for it
No thanksgiving paradin' this, but we marchin' like the Saint's came in
So run and hide, eyes open wide 'cause this gon' be your jam
Just burn a dutch and turn it up as I pass it off to Cam, damn

[Pre-Chorus: Cam'ron]
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Cam'ron]
Yo, this ridiculous, belligerent (Whoop!)
Oh my bad, I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit (Whoop!)
And girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant (I got that Mac with me)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Yo, we never met before but there'll be a mess for sure
When I was a baby, my crib was Mom's dresser drawer (Yep)
Infra-red, blastin' guns, duckin' shots
Another K, another tank, another Glock
They smokin' weed, shippin' E, crushin' rocks
Forget the Porsche, they want your baby mother boxed
And you pamper honey, word, he pamper honey
And she suckin' dick for formula and pamper money
And a real thug don't play that, laid back where the mac and the K at
Yayo turned to the straight crack, Maybach black with a gat won't say jack
Say jack, say jack, say jack, say jack
Say jack, say jack, I got that Mac with me

[Pre-Chorus: Cam'ron]
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Cam'ron]
This ridiculous, belligerent (Whoop!)
Oh my bad, I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit (Whoop!)
And girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant (I got that Mac with me)
