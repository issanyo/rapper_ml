[Intro]
Hallalujah, baby
Hallalujah, baby

[Verse 1: Cam’ron & Asia]
Yeah, look
Let me tell you rappers something (Tell ‘em Flea)
Look man I don't need you (Never did)
I never was a rapper, mayne
I’m a get money nigga, I do this for leisure (Fun)
But look at all these artist baby (Take a look)
I swear that you beautiful creatures
All inside they feelings (How come?)
When I don't wanna do a feature (What you do?)
I look inside my phone and laugh (Why you laugh?)
Why? ’Cause indeed its funny
Want 12 bars? Let me fuck your baby mother
Word to mother, (Word to mother) Why?
Nigga, I don't need your money
This game here easy-peasy (Easy-peasy)
Easy as riding a bike
Flyest nigga whenever I’m around, mayne (’Sho is)
I’m start wearing a kite
Shit, I might wear one tonight
Matched with a fresh pair of Nikes
Whenever I’m talkin’ or walkin’
You can declare it a flight, flight (Back off)
Left with that bird talk
Step back, kiss myself
Let the church talk

[Hook: Cam’ron]
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby, let the church talk
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah  baby
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby, let the church talk
Hallalujah baby

[Verse 2: Cam’ron & Asia]
Let me take a second, mayne (Take your time)
Yes, to speak to the church (Talk homie)
When it came to life, boy
Harlem niggas, we weren’t receiving the perks (Sure wasn’t)
They believed we were the worst (We the worst?)
Yeah, they would see us as jerks
‘Til I got this thing called Dipset
They laughed at me and said, “Boy, let see if it works”
I-I-I-I’m in the streets with the work
I used to think we were cursed
I can get deep with this verse
Had a pistol that burst, shots would leave and disperse
Cracked a dude, smacked his girl and told her I’m keeping your purse (Fuck outta here)
Got to thank the Lord tho (Thank God)
I’m in God’s classroom
‘Cuz a nigga got 8 cars now, (What else?) 4 cribs and 17 bathrooms
Yeah, I try to get it baby, (Everyday) it’s just a routine, nigga
Never ever, ever hit the lottery
All I had was a dollar and a dream, nigga
Let the church talk

[Hook: Cam’ron]
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby, let the church talk
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah  baby
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby, let the church talk
Hallalujah baby
