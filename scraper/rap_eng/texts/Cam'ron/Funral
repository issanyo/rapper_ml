[Cam'ron Speaks]

Girl is Cry, Preacher Sayn He a
Good Man, Man That's a Fucking Lie
Im at my Mans Funeral, An I'm Wearing
All Black Wanna Tell His Mother that

[Verse 1 Cam'ron]
I Wish That i Could be Like

So We all here Today Then i Seen
His Paper work it Was hotter then
Tabasco an all i could think about
Was Donnie Brasco i spit it out like
Tabacco We gone Have to kill em yo
Cause I'm More like the Sopranos
Who You Talkin I'm Talking Tony,Paulie,Silvio
Looking Back it Was Lots of Cream But Circle Back
This Was Not my Dream how ya Man gone Plot & scheme
With The Government They Loven it Get Shot on The Scene
Im Cooler Then PAC Tho When He Said "Man Somebody Shot Raheem"
I'm At my Mans Funeral Im Lookin at his Kids face
But he the one that did it to em Man What a Fucking Waste
Then i see his baby mom, sayin That she stay the strongest

I Really feel bad tho but that nigga knew the rules every meeting that
We had Done, No Snitching We Stayed, He Had me on Fire Now he Getting Cremated
He Gotta Leave Earth Yo We Ain't Doing Burial 10 Shots Ta The Face Man ooh Kill em Terio
Be Glade We Did it this way cause my Dogs Still bark We Gave him Back to his his Family
Instead of His Woulda Been Milk Cart, Yea You Know That Lost & Found Where They, Never
