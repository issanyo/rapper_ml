[Cam'ron's homie]
Yo Yo Cam, Yo Come here yo!

[Cam'ron]
Yo Duke, what up baby? What's popping?

[Cam'ron's homie]
Ah man I just seen your girl come out the G spot, yo!

[Cam'ron]
G spot?! Not my girl, that ain't my girl come out no fucking G spot nigga, you crazy?

[Cam'ron's homie]
Yo shortie with the blond hair and the "I love Cam" tattoo on her shoulder, wassup yo?

[Cam'ron]
Oh oh - you talkin about Tanya, she got the "I love Kim" tattoo, look just like my girl, you know?

[Cam'ron's homie]
You sure fam?

[Cam'ron]
I'm sure, my girl don't - naw nigga, I know who my girl is, that ain't her nigga, fuck is you talkin...

Ayo I took her from a blunt n brew
Stuntin crew
Tried to be like IU
Show her ass something new
Found out you nothing boo
Where they taught your logic (logic)?
Now you got me lookin like a talk-show topic
With things that'll blow the mind
Make me wanna tote the nine
Told me you were stripping (nah)
Nah, she working overtime (not my girl, pfft)
It was forgotten
The whole time you was plottin'
Guitly like O.J. I'm defending you like Cochran (Pffftss)
I bought you them lavish VV's that were sickening (Sickening)
Your older sis seen 'em and she told you they was fiction (Fiction?)
Then the light hit 'em and she seen they way they glisten
You got em girl, rock em girl, now Cam trickin!
And with me this bitch layin up
Everytime I get the phone another nigga hangin' up (Who the fuck is that callin here?)
Talkin in codes
I was about to get her Tiffany swirls
Envision these perls
Teach her vacations ain't Disney World
It's Sicily girl

[Unknown Singer]
(Chorus)
When a nigga's fed up
There's nothing you can do about it
Oh don't cry now
Cuz you been livin foul

[Cam'ron]
Ayo I guess she want a big profit (profit)
Cuz everytime I go to sleep she like to pick pockets
Like she down-town on forty-deuce
Leave, shortie is loose
Everytime she in the store she get a 40 and loose
Gators and silk
But Cam?
I would pour the guilt
Cuz' I stopped cheating ten bitches short of Wilt
The flames'll spark
But now the whole game's apart (apart)
Should have never said lets go on A Change of Heart
I was just playin, but now I can't live with the bitch (bitch)
She want Mother Love help
Forgive or Forget (nah, ma, fuck all that)
I play Miami like Marino
You fucked it all up like Sharon Stone in Casino (not at all)
Cuz now you finito (Finito!)
Forcin it
You see Cam scorchin it (scorchin it)
Need the type of girl that make me sing Fortunate
Now I have a gap and I get lost in it
I'm dead up, but I keep my head up, 'cuz I'm fed up

[Unknown Singer]
(Chorus x1)
When a nigga's fed up
There's nothing you can do about it
I don't want you no more
So pick up your shit and go

[Cam'ron]
Ayo I'm looking for a nice girl
Not a crass girl
Gimmie this, gimmie that, "Killa can I have?" girl
Dag girl (Dag girl)
You movin type fast girl (Shit!)
Knew each other 'bout an hour and a half girl (It's 1:30 now, I met you at 12...)
I need a girl that's in love with her cash
Get knocked together look at each other then laugh (ha ha ha)
Get a key she like "cut it in half" (half)
Get in beef, she like "the fuck is my bag?" (bag)
Take cover and blast, shit
And you ain't got to be covered with rocks
Fuck what you got - just don't be the slut of the block
All your beliefs, take you from all of your grief
Do me one favor: Just have all of your teeth (Please - have your teeth)
Shit, no disrespect, before I dead 'em I dot 'em (dot 'em)
One girl told me "Cam, head better without 'em"
Nah (No thank you.)

[Unknown Singer]
When a nigga's fed up
I don't give a fuck about you
Ain't no love lost
I don't need you
(x2)

[Girl]
Ohh, That's why you be callin 'em that

[Cam'ron]
Yeah that's what happend, you know? So that's what happened

[Girl]
But, you won't be callin ya mother a bitch and you won't be callin me a bitch?

[Cam'ron]
Oh fuck no! I-I-I mean you know, I wouldn't call you that, you know, I mean, you know, no disrespect
I would never do anything like that
Matter fact, you go do me a favor?

[Girl]

[Girl]
