[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
I told the girl it's over, no need to sob, baby
What she do? Put lipstick all on my garage, baby
Two flat tires, my windshield cracked
Car spray-painted, fucked up, real rap
She did surgery to the V, open heart
Gotta be careful with it, (what's that?) a girl's broken heart
She pulled up with her friends like: "what's shaking, nigga?"
Them hoes hopped out like Halloween and egged a nigga
You know that made me mad, popped the trunk, K I grabbed
Aimed at where her make-up bag, then thought about it
Wait a minute, this is same bitch that snitched up on her baby dad
He missed his son’s youth, that shit is uncouth
Catch 22, love, hate, thin line
This fatal attraction obsess, thin line
Duck-duck, goose-goose, I keep the duce-duce
I watched Snapped on Sundays, these bitches screws loose

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
Check the Audemar, put the car in park
Clovers, diamonds, Ace of Spades, party hard
We started off friends, then played bros and sisters
But I guess it’s incest cause now I'm fucking with you
Close nigga, so cold you get frosbit
Fucked your friend, fucked up your love
Now you are lovesick
Gimme that kitty-kat, I play Garfield
Flyer than Hartsfield, summersaults, cartwheels
Flipped out like a lingerie
Took her to the psychiatrist, 'Baby, you belong here!'
Started off cute with long hair
Then she cut it all off and told me that she want to be it
Damn!
