(Mark Medlock)
Sun in your eyes
Like a light of the magical moon
Like paradise
You`re a grace where my heart belongs
Harder I try
Love you more than my words can say
I watched the sky
Oh I know we will find a way
Love me as there werel no tomorow
Love me as there were no sorrows
Since I see you, my dreams come true
Oh mamacita I´m going crazy
Oh mamacita she blows my mind
Oh mamacita give me your daughter
Cause such a girl is hard to find
Cause such a girl is hard to find
Oh mamamamamamacita I´m going crazy
Oh mamacita, give me a chance
Oh mamacita, yeah she´s my baby
An everlasting love romance
An everlasting love romance
Grey turns to blue
In a bed of the end of the world
Baby just me and you
You are like a mysterious bird
You made it real
All the stars shining crystal blue
Oh how I feel
Wanna share all my dreams with you
Ever must be missing of emotions
You´re a lighting heart of the ocean
Since I saw you
My dreams come true
Oh mamacita I´m going crazy
She grows my mind
Oh mamacita gimme your daughter
Cause such a girl is hard to find
Cause such a girl is hard to find
Oh mamamamamamacita I´m going crazy
