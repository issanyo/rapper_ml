[Verse 1 - Cam'ron]
Lived by Ohio State, but never seen the Buckeyes
But I served students, ask the alumni
Kis of heroin, yeah, Killa had 'em dumb high
4-6 AM, I was done before sunrise
Scope in the trunk (for what?)
In case anyone tried
Like Fetti Wop though, I only needed one eye
Baby in love with the aura
Defense on point, but I'm more of a scorer (splash)
Hit the border, tell papi, yo, triple my order (Donde)
Phelps can't fuck with me when it come to the border
Yeah the water boy, Killa Bobby Boucher
New jays, .45 blow off his toupee
New girl, you stay; old girl... salute, babe!
It's a fiasco, they wanna be Lupe!
Peep it, succeeded
I got it, you need it
White, real white, so white, look like I bleached it

Hook: Mimi & [Cam'Ron]
I'm in, I'm in love with him! [and then I don't text her back, man!]
I don't, I don't fuck with him! [next day, I'm at her house, right...]
I'm in, I'm in love again! [and then I disappear on her]
What the fuck is up with him? ['cause I know how to chop her up!]

[Cam'Ron]
Get the work man, I chop it up!
I don't wanna talk or chop it up!
Chop, chop, chop, chop it up!

[Verse 2 - Cam'ron]
Let me tell y'all from the start again, never needed marketing
I'ma make another hundred thou' before it's dark again
Feds rush the crib, shit, I'm shaking like Parkinson's
Looking at my co-d, oh no, not again
I'm not selling druuuuuugs agaaaaaaain
(Until I'm what?)
Down on my hard luck agaaaaaaaaain
18 wheeler, just another heist (that all)
Regular though, just another night
Bread on your head, dread, yeah I'll pay the cover price
What I need that for? I'll kill him with a butter knife!
Malcolm X Boulevard, Lennox got the butter off
Y'all like my leathers though, baby, butter-soft
Sponsored the game, where A butterballed (swish)
Y'all all suckers, turkeys, Butterball
My life, what a ball
Had cover-girls under covers, y'all yeah we undercover lovers
Awwwwww....

And what they say man?

[Hook]
