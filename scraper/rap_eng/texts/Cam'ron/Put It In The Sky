[Intro]
Kill em's good, nigga
Time is now, man
Was real good, nigga
It's been a while
[?]

[Verse 1]
Ride around, trunk full that funk, call it that parliament
Shit go for 60 a brick, I got a lot of it
Glock 9, thirty shot clip still filled with hollow tips
Get up in the booth, put the beat on and knock the molly shit
Dope came straight out the jula, like polishin'
Watch them niggas that's close, know who you ridin' with
Never get caught in between, know who you sidin' with
Watch all the bitches you fuckin', know who you slidin' with
Pussy all slippery, wrist all glittery
One five one is the mob where my niggas be
Rest in peace, Train, we gon' ball in yo memory
Fifty blunts o' sour, a gallon of the Hennessy
Slow medicine, like I got the remedy
Niggas find link, they pay the penity
Niggas get hit with the gun that killed Kennedy
New rafe and side color, cinamon grint - cuss

[Pre-Hook]
This shit is tough, mane
This shit it tough, mane
This shit it tough, mane

[Hook]
I put it in the sky (that money)
I put it in the sky (the weed)
I put it in the sky (that money)
I put it in the sky (the skunk)

[Verse 2]
Shit, if ya down, let's get it, I ride around wid it
No quarters or halfs, I'm moving by the pound wid it
Then I sit at home, gettin' dome
Bird chirpin' on the dick, that's a chicken bone
Started touching shiz-shit, I sell this shit alone
Took her from first to third base, so I sent her home
You be happy to be me, much as sassy as Ree-Ree
But every mornin', man, [?], you happy to see me
I deserve this life, I come from hot things to murder knife
Shoot-out, knife fights, you heard it right
From a hell tale to gosh children, I'm hellbound
ATF, CIA, FBI, DOH, what the hell now?
DT's, DA, DEA, feel like hell solo, spellbound!
It's the circus stuff, so I deserve the clown
But I'm a show closer, hell, I'll blow ya curtains down
