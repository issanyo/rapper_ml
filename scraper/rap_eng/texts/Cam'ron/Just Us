Verse 1:
Uh, yo
Her shoes straight was hooker
Don't play, I cook it, what's shakin' sugar
I'm gettin' cake, fetti, cheddy, makin' mucke
She said she hate a pusher, I said I hate a booger
A snotty attitude, she laughed, I purple haze and kushed her
My charm captured her, she havin' man trouble
I'm havin' woman problems, it all began in Harlem
Wife with the Lou' Vuitton said I'm livin' wrong and I did her wrong
Forget the song, I swear I love her to death but we can't get along
Her problems big as hell, her dad died man, beat her friend crossed up
Ma Breast cancer got laid off and plus her son got sickle cell
Damn mami, hit the L, Misses Bell got shit to tell
Sounds horrific, ain't a doctor, but your son I wish him well
Under this damn pressure
She looked at me, I looked at her and then Cam measured
Started to Sanchez her

Hook:
Tell you some dudes might fight some
Gunplay, day time and the night come
But I'm from Harlem, want a problem yeah you're dealin' wit' the right one
The right one, a female, I like one, a straight girl
A dike one, either way, come on girl, it's just us (it's just us)
It's just us (it's just us)
I'm so tough, out the cuffs
Diamonds crushed, we so plush
It's just us (it's just us)
It's just us (it's just us)
It's just us (it's just us)
It's just us (it's just us)
It's just us

Verse 2:
Tell you the boy's amazing, I show some poise and patience
Lack of communication, well that there destroys a nation
I'm God's child right, my dudes employed by Satan
And once the grape get dry, hope y'all enjoy the raisin
Tanya never checked the check, Kim gettin' high, no self-respect
What you expect, MTV, naaa, crack got Direct Effect
Plus all the side-effects, they coming fully-loaded
And then divide ya death, fuck protect, better hide yo' neck
So I play homebase, and I keep a chrome case
And a lawyer just incase I catch a case, it's a very long race
Moving at the wrong pace, hope you got strong brakes
My crew ain't nuttin' but candles, yep we sittin' on cake
And all these birds we pitchin', well they're absurd and sickenin'
But I seen Brando 143rd and Lenox, dirty kitchens
Back of the Burban hun, you heard me hun, she 31
Gave her a Sanchez, yes a dirty one

Hook
