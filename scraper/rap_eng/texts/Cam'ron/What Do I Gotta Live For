(Cam'ron)
I ain't got shit to live for anyway
Yes you do
I'll see these niggas in hell anyway
You gotta lot to live for
Man fuck all that
I'm sayin, you live for me then
Fuck that shit
Bloodshed, bloodshed, bloodshed...

[Cam'ron: Verse 1]
Yo, yo
I'm ready to stick the gun to my head and bust a clip
I want the world to see the blood to drip, pus to drip
Crash the car crush the whip
And it's one time I loved the six, fuck this shit
Trust a chick? Never that
It's only to fuck a bitch to fuck a bitch
Girl ran a circus on me Wrangling Brothers tip
Fuck my connect, fuck I expect, I could get weight
I'll take half of his cake, run, I would debate
Father had the nerve to tell me I'm a mistake
I said, dad I told my daughter that, I could relate
And the beef up the hill, is real gettin live
Still sittin by, still gettin high
And I don't hold my tongue
I was wrong enough to tell 'em
That I could stop doing drugs long enough to sell em
A proclamation, with intoxication
[Ayo Cam' gettin high!] A three rock occasion
Whoa, I'm so high, you're so high
What the fuck these motherfuckers put in my lye??
Make a million dollars, yo I could if I tried
But why the fuck I gotta pay him, him, and him?
Yo fuck around I'ma spray him, him, and him
And fuck her when your girl lay, him, him, and him
Man, that's why I'ma give it up
The Benz truck driv' it up, every weekend did it up
But tell me why, live for what?

What do I have to live for...
What do I have to live for...
What do I have to live for...
What do I have to live for..

[Cam'ron: Verse 2]
Yo, yo, yo, I was wishin for knowledge
But didn't have tuition for college
So that mission abolished
Straight street like power, politics, and policy making
Give a fuck how I see bakin, gimme this, gimme that
Gimme your hat, gimme your gat, gimme your shit
Gimme your bricks, gimme your kicks
Matter fact you pussy, gimme your bitch
Cam' is clappin, I'm in
Can't negotiate with Samuel Jackson
It's A Time To Kill, what do I do?
My girl pregnant, rent is due, the phone is off
The heat is off, no the heat is on nigga
In the street is on, I'm about to beat upon
A nigga til they deceased or gone, at least I'm gone
What do it matter, they just relate to Binnis
Girl fucked my man like Jada from Innis
But I play to the finish, got blazed in a blemish
Least I wasn't caged in a clinic
In there, you age in a minute
But you know the sharks, diplomat ho, we know the art
Come through leave your shit wet like Noah's Ark
We order the pies, you sort of a lie
You ain't 730 nigga you 'bout a quarter to five
Life's on the line, wife's goin blind
Tell me man, god, what type of a sign
Take a nitrogen nine, man, that's why I'ma give it up
Wrists stay glittered up, every weekend did it up
But tell me why, live for what

What do I have to live for...
What do I have to live for...
