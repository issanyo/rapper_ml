[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
We hit too many left turns to make it right
My black fist and a peace sign, I say goodnight
But I'mma stay the fight, laser light with you're a-alike
Here's an order black: be a quarterback, take a hike
Hut one, hut two, hut three, your family tossed
Calico, eighty one to your chest: Randy Moss
"How much the candy cost?" Then I'm explaining to folks:
"It's terrific, but be specific: the paint or the coke?"
I refrain from the hoax, lame, this game is a joke
But hit the hotline, got mine the Range to the Rover
I move the work from New York to New England
New Hampshire, New London, New Jersey, New Zealand
Hop out like "Who dealin'? Who slingin'?"
Brick looking like "Who wheelin'? Who blingin'?"
Then I handle weed and tell 'em how my parents eat
They got the work, it don't work? Your money back, guaranteed
But I guarantee money with your money you'll be after me
Fuck it up? Huh, a disaster B
Casualties actually, but I move casually
You're vulnerable, not a judge but call me your honorable
Go head and vomit fool, bomb the unbombable
We beef like a farmer do, my jewelry is a carnival
Heard the goddamn chain, its like a ferris wheel
You fuckin' with Sosa, you won't find a better deal

[Hook: Cam'ron(Skitzo)]
Where you at? Who you with?
Get your gat, hit a lick
Flip a pack, flip a brick, man
(And we got it for cheap)
Louie hat, louie kicks
Toolie strapped in the mix
Mooley move back cause
(Yeah we got it for cheap!)
(Yeah we got it for cheap!)
Yeah we got it for cheap!
(Man we got it for cheap!)
Man we got it for cheap!
(Man we got it for cheap!)
Man we got it for cheap!
(Yeah we got it for cheap!)
We got it for cheap!

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I sold the jums and the rock, filled the guns to the top
40th nigga, smok a blunt with Barack
Put your heart in your stomach, your lungs in your socks
Your girl in my bed, your son on my block
Yeah, they stole my style trife, but this the jungle
Welcome to the wild life, "Damn you got a foul wife"
I picked her up from karaoke and pilate class
She like to deepthroat, me I call it lollygag
Y'all niggas probably fags, not a body cast, a body bag
Fuck his toe, leave his whole body tagged
Primo give me bricks, I give papi cash
Burglars hit them licks, he'll let the shotty blast
At nine years old, ya'll was watchin' goof troops
Me the only fifth grader with the troop suit
Twenty years later, bitches boof it up in Gucc' shoes
For a month' rent, a fly purse and some new boots
You out the loop lou, me I'm in the crew coupe
Truck boat, tough coke, same color as Dove soap
Niggas needin' favors, believe I'm major
Straight out the hood, but you should see my neighbors
You say a hundred dollars, he say a piece of paper
Yeah we own our cars, you still leasin', hater?

[Hook: Cam'ron(Skitzo)]
Where you at, who you with
Get your gat, hit a lick
Flip a pack, flip a brick, man
(And we got it for cheap)
Louie hat, louie kicks
Toolie strapped in the mix
Mooley move back cause
(Yeah we got it for cheap!)
(Yeah we got it for cheap!)
Yeah we got it for cheap!
(Man we got it for cheap!)
Man we got it for cheap!
(Man we got it for cheap!)
Man we got it for cheap!
(Man we got it for cheap!)
We got it for cheap!
