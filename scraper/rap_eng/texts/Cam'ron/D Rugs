[Intro - Cam'ron]
This song goes out to all the teens across America man
Who livin' in single parent homes and they mother or father wanna pick they boyfriend or girlfriend over you
Remember parents, kids don't ask to be born
My story goes a little bit deeper, come up about '88

[Verse 1]
Yo, this nigga named d-rugs
My moms dates him
Swear to God I hate him
If I could I would break him
When he comes around, her brain sizzles like a Steakum
Damn, can't jakes take him
She neglected me
Run around with this punk nigga recklessly
Had him in her tummy
Guess she was in ecstasy
For his love
Took the best of me
O-d'd excessively
That's her boyfriend
Or her toyfriend see
Let me specify
Her last man
Took the money
Left the guy
Desert dry
And gave it to d-rugs
He kept her high
When he come around
See her facial
Guess it was his fragrance
She sniffed it in her nasal
She wouldn't even listen
I told her he ain't faithful
Fuckin' wit Aunt Rachel
Ya'll so dumb
Makin' me look disgraceful
He got a girl named Hazel
And another white one
With him it ain't racial

[Hook - Brotha]
I'm your mama
I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga
In the alley
I'm your doctor
When in need
I'm your coke
I'm your weed
You know me
I'm your friend
Your main boy
Thick and thin
I'm the monster in your dreams
For my love
You will fiend

[Verse 2]
What the deal dun?
It's '91
Moms still strung
On this nigga d-rugs
His game's tight
Every night in the room she screw him
Yeah she do him
But my man Un knew him
Schooled me to him
Told me he got mad hoes
He used to pimp him
He can get you mad doe
What you mean?
Yo it's more than just your mother
He's got other partners
He's a foreigner though
The cops don't like him
Illegal alien
Can't even say his name on the phone
But you can get money with him
Then leave him alone
Or you'll be inside the new cuffs
Plus a news rush
Told some more about him
Then he introduced us
Took me to the block where everybody get him off
Showed me his clientele
Ever since - hit it off
He was right
D-rugs got dumb freaks
Men and women love him
Got me 10 grand in one week

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now it's '98
D-rugs, he payed me well
500 S-E-L
Got me land in A-T-L
It's all swell
Way beyond a felony
But now that we together
I think my mom is jealous
Cause he with me now
And see the way I G him
But when it comes to her
She even pay to see him
Yo, money excites me
But my niggas on the block
They got shysty
Cause I'm wit d-rugs
They don't like me
Tried to snipe me
Right before the damn feds had indicted me
You know my mother
Her nostrils wide
Too much of d-rugs left her hospitalized
We both was arrested
Stars of the block
Her by cardiac
Me by the cops
But for my mother
Yo it's nothin' but love
But that's what we get--fuckin' with drugs

[Hook]
