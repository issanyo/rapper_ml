Whoa, here go the remix

Spit clips well
Two guns named Kelly and B, so it won't be a missed shell
They chalking them out, Hov know what I'm talking about (Yes)
Ok, well DJ I'm on the celly flowin'
Tell Beyonce that my punch lines with have Kelly rollin'
Im steady showin', deadly flowin'
Freddy going no body can spit it better at this very moment
Cam, Fred, Waka, goddam he knocka
Bx's finest, I'm coming for tall stacks

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Open wide, I know your thirsty
We gonna party in the club like it's our B-day
But in a G way, you fucking with me
Bottles in the air like "Yo DJ!!"
I swag through the club, me and Diddy diddy boppin'
Brick Squad Mafia, the whole label poppin'
I see his girl eye watching so he cock blockin'
I let the light hit the ice, just to blind a nigga
Beat just right and the club extra hype
The liquor kicked in, I'm higher than a motherfucker
Lethal like Danny Glover, fighter no lover
You can't play me like a sucka
They call me Waka Flocka
Yeah

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Killa
How much props could a fellow get?
So dangerous, be delicate
You ain't getting pussy you celibate
Student of my kind don't test my intelligence
Hood nigga but I like elegance, relevance
Closet the size of an elephant
Don't want to talk, no no settlements
Money, cars, clothes my elements
Black on black whip looking like liquorice
Lollipop mouth think about licking this
Digital underground we kicking this
Hey, come here big girl are you ticklish?
Jewelry, well kind on ridiculous
All the mumbling, I don't speak gibberish
Burrough right in the cut
Yo Fred, I'm the nicest or what?

[Hook x2]
So crazy, So So Crazy (the remix)
So crazy, So So Crazy (the remix)
Right now , right right now
Let's do it
Right now , right right now
