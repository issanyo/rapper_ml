[Verse: Cam'ron]
You really think I wanna fucking sit here and rap?
When thereâ€™s cars to be copped
Chicks to be slapped
Wrists to be wrapped
Grip to be stacked
Guns to be cocked
Clicks to be clacked
[?]
Girls like me better in Prada
Like me better in nada
Hermes, Gucci exclusively
Know my hoochie coochie is used to me
Oh man I'm with you used to see
When I wild out they say they see their youth in me
They don't wanna see this damn 100 proof in me
100 guns, 100 knives the proof is me
Midnight, pick fight come on a roof with me
A lot of girls say "Cam you look cute to me"
They just wanna get used to cheese, used to V's
If they wanna sex go do for me
