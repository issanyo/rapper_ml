Yo, in Harlem we got buildings collapsing and shit
Niggas getting bust off petty money
That's why everywhere I go I keep mines, nigga

[Bloodshed]
Yo, don't cross the line if you afraid of the guage
I smell the pussy, see the bitch running down your leg
You fuckin' with a well known felon, I do more than just leave ya swellin
I'll blast you in your melon and leave you smellin

[Cam'Ron]
I had a fight with a seven footer, he wouldn't drop
Pulled the Glock, left him frozen like a Pudding Pop
My laughter couldn't stop
It's something about me that just love's killin
I'm a big villian, a send a slug peeling, slash drug dealing

[Mase]
Fuck the river up the nile (denile) I'm headed
Plus with my collastics, wish the Latino from Riker's Isle would set it
Without the Army or the tank I'm liver
In jail the shank survivor, the couldn't control me with a tranquilizer

[Bloodshed]
Where I resume is gloom, for we rolling some fumes
Gotta stay alert from goons that be causing Lennox Doom

[Cam'Ron]
Aiiyo, you get bombarded if you come unprepared son
Cause yo, there's no such thing as a fair one

[Bloodshed]
Yo, my street is buzzing with dirty brothers
That kill other niggas mothers, just to get on newspaper covers

[Mase]
Aiiyo, you get bombarded if you come unprepared son
Cause yo, there's no such thing as a fair one

[Bloodshed]
Word up, take off the safety and insert the clip
Then I start to flip, bust off like dicks, inside porno flicks
Up under my tongue is where my blade rest
My 12 guage stress, is even more scarier than the Aids test

[Cam'Ron]
And the Killa got real weight, semi-autos I feel hate
In between my ears and my head I got steel plates
So get that ass flamed, hard head, I got brass brains
Horror's my last name, with mad fame
That last forever like grass stains

[Mase]
See I'm insane, I got brothers that be in gangs
With three in they brains, IV in they veins
Prey to God man, man pleaing in change
Often I'm bugged, then bust off in a thug
Have a chump coughing up blood, then feel his coffin with slugs

[Bloodshed]
Where I resume is gloom, for we rolling some fumes
Gotta stay alert from goons that be causing Lennox Doom

[Cam'Ron]
Aiiyo, you get bombarded if you come unprepared son
Cause yo, there's no such thing as a fair one

[Bloodshed]
Yo, my street is buzzing with dirty brothers
That kill other niggas mothers, just to get on newspaper covers

[Cam'Ron]
Aiiyo, you get bombarded if you come unprepared son
Cause yo, there's no such thing as a fair one

[Bloodshed]
Mad niggas dream about taken mines
But if they do, they get they faces stitched up just like FrakenStein
Cause Bloodshed's known for jacking crabs
When I act with mags, I leave fags
Soaking blood like Maxi pads

[Cam'Ron]
Aiyo, when it comes to bread, niggas make loafs
You run around with fake toast
Money or your life, nigga I take both
I hate the heavens and you shady reverends
Niggas like +90210+, I like Killa Cam +187+

[Mase]
And I'mma give a fag slug, once I cock the mag and snub
Then puff a bag of drugs, on the fucking Isle with thugs
So if you down to blast, Murder with the pound to cash
Lay you in the ground and grass, with roses all around your ass

[Bloodshed]
Where I resume is gloom, for we rolling some fumes
Gotta stay alert from goons that be causing Lennox Doom

[Cam'Ron]
Aiiyo, you get bombarded if you come unprepared son
Cause yo, there's no such thing as a fair one

[Bloodshed]
Yo, my street is buzzing with dirty brothers
That kill other niggas mothers, just to get on newspaper covers

[Mase]
