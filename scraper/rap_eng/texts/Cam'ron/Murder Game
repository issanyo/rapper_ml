[Verse 1]
You ain't about that murder game
NFL, yeah, yeah, we run a murder gang
I'm from 40th, them cops are dogging us
I chill out on 39th, but them niggas don't talk too much
Word, they'd rather let the burner do it
I swear I'm mister murder unit
Lynch mob, same gang
Scream team, 40 rules, bang bang
I'll remove your melon
'shit killa, who you telling?''
And the girls don't fuck with you they be like ''oh, he telling''
In furs you'll find me - birds and hymens
I don't lie like coop, but I got the murder mind
(Yes I do, Yes I do)
Sophie and Katrina baby, keep the nines and ninas in Newark, subpoenas baby...
Count that, "blah blah blah how bout that? he a cigarette nigga let me out that"
Left him stinkin' like a loud pack, owwww....

(Hook x2)
So what you tell em?
You ain't about that murda game!
Back up we in the burbs with cain, swervin' lanes, curvin' lames
Bang bang bang you heard the thing
(Pussy nigga, shut up!)
(Pussy nigga, shut up!)

You know I got that heroin
I take it down to Maryland...
You know them vets need they medicine
Fiends knockin', hurry up and let 'em in
Papi came to see me, yeah I'm feelin lucky man
Got that dog food, I ain't talkin puppy chow
No gravy train, no Purina
No Kibbles&Bits, so money train that real ether
That grey & tan... Made me a prayin' man
Made three mil' alone, Ohio State Campus
They stuck on basic, it’s bucks I’m chasin’
Harlem World forever but I rep that Buckeye Nation
I could talk about it – statute of limitations up
They can’t indict me know, no them charges never stuck
You relate? We buildin’ – we’ll take your building
We on the lobby, one month, we’ll make a million

(Hook x2)
So what you tell em?
You ain't about that murda game!
Back up we in the burbs with cain, swervin' lanes, curvin' lames
Bang bang bang you heard the thing
(Pussy nigga, shut up!)
(Pussy nigga, shut up!)
