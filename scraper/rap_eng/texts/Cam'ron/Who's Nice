[Cam'ron]
Yo, turn me up some b!
I'm about to lace ya'll
Check it out
I'm not a muthafuckin' joke b!
Whoever think I'm not nice
This is for ya'll punk muthafuckas!
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
See the drug game was always the man's sport
That's what Cam thought so everyday I had a hundred grams bought
On the transport kept it inside the Jansport
A real hooty game, we ain't care who we blame
Shit was all the same until Guili' came with a moody aim
You know the mayor nigga, a fight crime approach
Acting like a kind host but gettin time for a roach
A little indo
That's when yo, I said I'm messin with these bimbos
It's easier to pimp hoes, nowadays they simp ho
It don't take much to make her
Just take her to a place where It's nice
Show her the ice and might give her a fake fur
Cause girls I control them classy
Old and sassy
Old and nasty
I ain't gonna front that nigga Gold he gassed me
But now I'm flowin fastly, rollin jazzy
Just a while ago I was rollin badly
We was on the low wit Aggie
But now what have we
Range Ro' and Navy life size
My girl yo she slices pies
A benz is what my wife drives
You know Qeet' nigga
Executive thug
But she respects me and loves
Don't let your head meet her slug
Until she sprayed out and layed out
Ineffections of blood
A lil' thick chick that'll click quick
Do anything for the dick dick
You know what else that puzzles me?
I find this shit a riddle
How come when you got a lot?
People say you got a little
Like they say you act a little funny
Cause you got a litte money
And you did a little song and
Made a little money
Oh, you know my favorite
Oh, you think you a little star
Cause you got a little fans and you drive a little car
I prove they all are liars
Saying that they got a fire
Hang em up on a barber wire
Yo, you think you got attire
To the point like Stoudamire
Yeah I'm a harsh nigga
That drink hard liquor
A six benz car getter
You know Digga
He ain't rich
He's a star figure
Platinum deep
Hangs with Jews
Chills up at their barmitzfah's
He loves the hooligans
Now we eat at houlihans's
Seen Ed Lover and Doctor Dre
We told them niggas Who the Man
Pulled the toast out on these niggas one time
And even Cuda ran
You know that I'm a skitzo
Who listens to calypso
But I'm quick though
And old school like Hungry Hungry Hippo
Ask my Queens niggas how I get dough kiko
Now I beat up clicks, eat up chicks
Ask my man how I beat up shit
And when I'm out of work, I got to re-up quick
Every six the same pies, drink from Cris' to St. Ides
Every hit my bank rise, and no bitch I ain't high!
I've been hotter
Since I was in pampers hittin pinatas
You win nada
Come on I got put on by Mase and Big Poppa
So I'm glad you sat down
I ain't want Uncle Un to bring the gats down
He spat rounds, I heard that nigga clap towns
But me I never back down
My mother, she can sign that
I know you're thinkin' that It's bout that time
Nigga I wanna rewind that
So go ahead and rewind it faggot
