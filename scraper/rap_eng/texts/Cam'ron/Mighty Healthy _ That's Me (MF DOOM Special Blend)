[Verse 1 : Ghostface Killah]
Both hands clusty, chilling with my man Rusty
Low down, blew off the burner kinda dusty
The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape, Rae co-host
Monty Hall expo, intellect, you read pro
Son trifling fuck, wildflower on the cycle and
Picked up the broom thought I was Michael-in'
West Brighton Pool, now I'm into Iron Duels
Turn Nuns to Earths Whoopi, she at Allah school
Inhale break beats of hell A-Alikes propel parallel
Duracell knot, you flash a burnt cell
Snap out of CandyLand kids, the old rumor is
Blacks become immune and shit, we never did
Like eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy over herbs
Men marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter, living off land
You god damn right I fuck fans, king me
Check checkmate props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stock with Bill Gates now

[Bridge]
When we hug these mics we get busy
Come and have a good time with G-O-D
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle
Scream, shout, laugh or just giggle
Shake that body, party that body
Don't fuck with Ghost you'll feel sorry
That's word, I'm not the herb
Understand what I'm saying, saying, saying

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert
Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in your grass, spiteful
Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter
Culprit, prince of the game wish you could see us
We lay low glitter wax full bangles
Priceless ropes, lay around the God get tangled
Woolly hair, eyes fiery red, feet made of brass
Twelve men following me, it be the God staff
Move, every script's like Miramax
Smash the big boy, totalled it, Wilshire and Fairfax
Son beaming wifey on the beach, sipping Zima
Wu 'binos, to latinos, we love Selena
Overnight, God schedules, Fed-Ex
Pretty soloette velvet nice DNA scroll genetics
Too hot, to handle one thought from scrambling the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack 'em, say when
He rolling up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts
Yo kid stop fronting on the ground 'fore you get touched
It's Canada Dry sess with Allah, son
We want rye, we want it so bad we might cry

[Verse 3 : Cam'ron ]
Yo, I don't understand how these cats sip daiquiris
Like it's all good down at the hit factory
Be on 54th, whole clique backing me
All that click clackery takes your wrist wrappery
I ain't no rapper, b, I skeet Uzis
And I can't act, turned down 3 movies
So gimme your chain, your jewels and your cash
And your fast food, I'll eat your food fast
My rude ass, carries 3 weapons
And I'll give your face a c-section and keep stepping
Who else in a hurry to mirk
We kill girls, rape em', bury their skirts
Imagine me wake up 7:30 for work (what?!)
I'd rather run the streets in a 730 with work
But met this knucklehead, thought he want a order
Came and asked me stop pitching to his daughter
Y'Serious? This man can't be
Be glad I'm not in her damn panties
Got a damn handy
How you going to ever ask stop carrying candy
I'm going to sell to anybody in your damn family
Your Uncle Tom, your Aunt Tammy, your Grandmammy
Your right hand man Randy, understand me
In Atlanta I got an outlandish land piece and a matching land
Desert-colored: Sandy

[Hook]
You know the one with the whips, THATS ME
The one with the chips and the chips, THATS ME
The one with the toast, pants saggy, yelling out get at me
Get at me, nigga, THATS ME
The one that be running and dodging, YOU
The one that be sucking mad dick, YOU
The one that's scared of some yay yo
Always wanna lay low, cause your girl say so, YOU, biatch

[Verse 4 : Cam'ron ]
I could show you some ice
Throw you advice
You not that good dog, who told you you're nice
Ay, yo your crew, switch siders
When I come through, hey Cam
Dick riders
But I only mess with Navigators 528
6 drivers, big buyers, where you live we live liver
Come through, stick your suppliers
Mack so many hoes, dick in saliva
Gash her up, ma, put it on you mouth
Then I grab her neck and try to take her tonsils out
And I don't got beef, I don't play those games
If I did though believe me I would say y'all names
Go to your house, red dot scope your crib
Smack your earth, snatch your seeds, choke your wiz
My crew split it was my mistake
But to my nigga Duke we all make mistakes
I'm going to get shit right if I spend my cake
Jimmy, I'm a get you up out of 5h
This is for my niggas that load the pipe
Saying I'm the best just not promoted right
You know my life
Drink, smoke, roll some dice
Control the hiest
Know I'm a patrol your schiest
We all get schiest
