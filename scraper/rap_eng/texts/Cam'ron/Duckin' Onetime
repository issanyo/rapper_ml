[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
I went to the block, manicured, see my worker
Approached them, told them
''Look, I'm not a big fan of you as you fucking up money''
He said ''you supposed to be the man and all''
Look nigga damn the tours give a fuck about a damn award
It's all about the principle
Look, I ain't trying to be your principal
But I ain't dumb, and you?  Ain't invincible
Niggas talk subliminal then grab their genitals
I don't play that shit, a different individual
You got me thinking criminal
He said ''I'm only a soldier''
Well, good - pay your general
Over a small thing, but let small things slide
You be a poor thing, then I heard

[Hook: Sen City]
My life, my life, my life, my life
Ducking onetime
If you'd whipping the white you’d be where I be
If you'd whipping the white you’d be where I be

[Verse 2: Cam'Ron]
Yeah, so I'm envied by most of you
So I don't get close to you
Still be on Lennox, fuck am I supposed to do?
When Tito fire escape - Grey Goose, Mimosa too
Next morning, take a flight straight to my ocean view
By the C M beach, from my room you can see the beach
Gucci linen, see the sheets, green and peach
Chandeliers out your reach, smoking that Chong and Cheech
Two girls in thongs Dawn and Keish, off the leash
I'm trying my best to be discrete
I'm trying my best to leave the streets (I am)
But I got some hungry niggas and they need to eat
Oh shit, you see the chief? (There he go)

[Hook]
