(Cam'Ron)
Yo, yo, uh, uh
Y'know how Cam act drunk or playin' sacks, stand back
Have a girl with a grand pack on Amtrak
Real shrewd, all these niggas be harrasing a dude
Eat a girl that's mad or put glass in my food
Or kill me in my sleep or fill me in deep
And if we in Alaska, still we feel heat
She know how to treat me, don't bug me or beat me
And after she skeet me, she f**k me

(Case)
I remember the days when I wanted you
And tell me, dancing lady, said to step to you
But now that I'm gone, attitude's gone
Say you wanted me all along
What should I do for you?

(Chorus)
Oh, so damn sexy but you're scandalous
I know I need a baby I can trust
Oh, when it comes to you
All I wanna do is give it to you

Now don't pretend it ain't my antics that attractted you
Ain't nothing changed about Case since I first met you

But now that I'm on, your attitudes gone
You say you wanted me all along
What should I do?

I always wanted to give it to you
Touch you in the places you wanted to
Now is my time to put it on you
If only you tell me you want me to

(Chorus)
(Cam'Ron)
Uh, uh, uh
Nice girls with a fella thought
I need a hoe that make her tell that bitch
Come give me from the Hella Port
With a blunt roll, hear her bone
Fault even with the stunt
Case be unfold, drink milk a month old
Be duckin' a fever with one roll
And no one to console, come roll
With Big Pun and, yeah, Kenny Smoove
Take a bath, bitch
And get her in any move

(Chorus to end)
