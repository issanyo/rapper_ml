[Verse 1]
Been had the gift of gab, lived in the sickest pad
Slept with mice and roaches, woke up pissed up slab
School of hard knocks, I on the vicious Ave
Jim chase Mark Chan, we beat a bitches ass
Ask me who you loving, Cam you been bugging
Must have lost your mind; you fought Lou Simms' cousin
In St. Mark's, yeah big LE watch
My nigga red squashed it, forget that topic
40th, down the block danger zone
Up the ave, forty wolves, hope y'all niggas bring your chrome
What you saying homes, cops they raiding homes
Activator juice, yes they'll spray your dome
From a tiny tube, developed grimey dude
Stuck delivery, took all his Chinese food
I'm so good but bad, I'm so kind but rude
America's most wanted, should have signed to Cube
Plus it's savage, cop car crash your door
Furthermore heard the boy em at the sack amore
Whore yes, overseas more sex
4 jets, Corvettes, and I ain't done a tour yet
Cuz I'm moving bricks, yes they serve in fours
Signing off Dipset boss, truly yours

We gon make it make it, we gon make it yall

We gon get it get it , money we gon get it get it
We gon make it make it, we gon make it yall
We don't make it make it, we gon take it yall
We gon get it get it , we gon get it get it
We gon get it get it , we gon get it get it

[Verse 2]
My cerebral stressed, Eagle let it rest
Feel It In The Air yeah, Sigel said it best
It's a legal mess, needles need to death
Blame the government, until then I need to chef
Turn right, lead left, street games scrams
Call the cops ahk, like we need a ref
You can't cheat at chess, I can see your chest
No heart, cherish your oxygen, breath your breath
He need a rest, how he gon be the best
I guess a couple slugs he need to catch
See the sketch, you Lassie
The gun the Frisbee proceed to fetch
Side up the hoopty, sprayed up the Sentra
It be sixty years before I'm laid up in benter
Sprayed up her denture, your girl
Then I laid her placenta, blew haze in her rental
Some days in December, some days I remember
Call Sugar Ray want to play the contender
Just say I got a temper
And my temperature is off the thermometer
Korean New Year to Hanukah I'm bombing ya
Put you to sleep for good pajama ya

Right your He-Man pajamas
Wrap you up in your pac man sheets
Killa
