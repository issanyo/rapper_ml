[Intro: Juelz Santana]
Yeah, who, where they at? Bring 'em to me
Let me talk to these niggas man, Dipset y'all with me

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Ayo listen to this gangsta, feel this music man
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Yo, yo, yo now let's get down to business, I've been gone
For a minute, but I'm back now down for business
Yeah I found a small town I had to visit
Had a bunch of hungry workers, who was down to get it
So I got up and left, hit the town with brizicks
Nickels, dimes, quarters, O's, half of brizicks
Know the rules of getting mad, if they ask they get it
Plus I was giving it to them, like I had permission
Now I'm back focused on rap, anybody got a problem holla back
Two shots swallow that, and I know what the people want
Got what the people want, I know you not hot
You not what the people want, they want me
Santana man, bandana wrapped around his head
Goddamn it man, is it him?
Yes, say it again, yes, I'm playing to win
Yes, hey come again, nigga, I've been watching
I've been plotting, I'm the realest thing popping
Since Osama Bin Laden, so pay homage
Ladies salute me, gentlemen salute me, the general you'll soon see

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Ayo listen to this gangsta, feel this music man
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
Ayo listen to this gangsta, feel this music man
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Killa
Ayo, this is just for gangstas, that'll black out, MAC out
Bling out, shank out, and shank ya
Y'all looking lost, took your plates, gave the crooks the forks (go eat)
We gon' eat whether its fish or pork
They thirsty and ready to take your burger, turkey and veggie
You ever work with machetes?
I broke bread with billionaires that think flipping birds is petty
They soon serve with semi, my tune turn to envy
Balloon pop, you know I burn the friendly
And pull cars off...
... Huh, I'm so nice, I took the last two bars off
I wasn't rapping nothing
I was wrapping something, now that was stunting
And baby I model
I always put the coke in the baby powder bottle (that's Killa, Killa)
'Cause I follow for figures, my hollow and trigger
Swallow a nigga, like a bottle of liquor (Hennessy)
And when I cock that heat back, ya hatchback, hard top
Or drop top seat back, harving and reach back
Body in the seat, head in the trunk
Tell his mother eat that, laid up feet fat
I'm a better boy
Ohio players, Detroit cheddar boys
Harlem too, gangstas do it
Montana Santana, gangsta music, Killa

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yo, ayo listen to this gangsta, feel this music man
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
Ayo listen to this gangsta, feel this music man
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Yo, I got you niggas exhausted, you gotta be nauseous
How I pull up, stop and be flossing (oh)
Chrome wheels spinning out of proportion
Twin pipes on the back, letting out the exhaustion
Whoa, kids love me, but I'm no idol
I hold rifles, dog, my spit game is so vital
I'm what the games been missing like both Michael's
Jackson and Jordan, from cracking to balling, I'm back
I'm a heavy pimper, 24/7 pimper
Where your girl, go get her, bet I pimp her
And I ain't mad, that the Towers fell
I'm mad the coke price went up, and this crack won't sell
I'm mad I gotta grind harder, hit the block harder
Get some new workers, buy some new product
Get my clientele back, shit I might as well black
Burn the town down one more time, what the hell scrap
For my niggas who can't get it, upstate sittin' in San Quentin
Greens on they back on the feet Stan Smithing
This is gangsta music, please dance with it
Spit your razors out, party in the mess hall
This is just for gangstas, pardon all the rest of y'all
Juelz Santana make it happen man
Dip-set grip TECs, Harlem's own Taliban, come on

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Ayo listen to this gangsta, feel this music man
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
Ayo listen to this gangsta, feel this music man
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
