Cam'ron:
Yo, who wanna rump wit' us, bump wit' us, guns a buss
It's fun to us, run to us, pump, jump, come, yuh tough
I'm a loco head, that leave you so so dead
Black Caddy, beef patty for that coco bread
Waddup Leon, Tito, Kurt, Coco Dread
Fuck Robocop, we fill 'em up with robo-lead
Gal need advice, told her we can eat a bite
Ate the oxtails, you can keep the rice
You should be polite, I told her that she need a life
I'm not a cop but trust, I can read ya right
What's yo' story, Gator told Maury
You stay gettin' dug out, Joe Torry
This beat here remind me of Flatbush
Rube bwoy act up, blat, get his cap pushed
So, Naffa gang, Kuffa Gang, cool for gain
Ay stop it mane, stupid chain, move again

Verse 2
Penz:
I'ma relax with the haze in back of the stage
And shit I smoke the same color as Saint Patrick's Parade
Yeah, keep a Mac and a gauge packin', attackin' wit' rage
Stackin' and mackin' until they put my ass back in the cave
I'm actually brave, this beats easy to cook
I'm on my Peter Pan shit, I don't need me a Hook
Got 100 of bars, spittin', I done it with stars
You ain't gotta take my shirt off to see none of my scars
I was locked down, 500 Pearl Street
Look now, Nextel, 500 girls deep
And ya girl a freak cuz the kid handle green
But she wax, shorty breath smell like tangerines
F defense, homeboy handle me
4-5th'll have ya ass shakin' like a tambourine
Where is son from, all I need is one gun
Prospect, Penz, Dipset with the Bum Bum
