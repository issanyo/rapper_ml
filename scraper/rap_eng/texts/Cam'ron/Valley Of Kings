[Verse 1: Cam'Ron]

Cars we order in flavours, you order from Avis?
They come around me why? They know my aura contagious
And I'm sort of courageous, yeah the kids smart
Forget Biz Mark, they gon' catch more than the vapours
Next door at your neighbours they said all you haters
Set you up the very moment I offered them paper
In the loft I'm the Mayor and the kicks, the University Of Florida
Of course that they gator. Buckhead, Bankhead, all of Decatur
Body Tap, tap me out, they got all of my paper
You can jump if you want I'll pull the pump on the pumpers
Dump on them motherfuckers, yeah then dump 'em in dumpsters
Yeah I'm hard block, hard drops, hard rocks, hardbody
Closed casket, that'll be a hard top
Hard block, hard drops, hard rocks, hardbody
Closed casket, that'll be a hard top

[Hook: P.A.P.I (NORE)]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, the skully on in the summer time
Drop car in the winter time, I'm with my foreign niggas
We on a foreign grind, spending foreign money, foreign cars
Foreign wine...Foreign niggas, thats what it is!
Foreign niggas, I said what it is? Foreign niggas, what it is!
Foreign niggas, I said what it is?

[Verse 2: Mega]

Women saying they cute, Balmain suede boot
Ebitsfield Palace cap yeah I'm on my Babe Ruth
Kick some game to her, i just did it for fun
So when i knock it out the park i hit it and run
I'm as sick as they come, the rap games illest, flame spitters
Mega and may business, aim blickers
Say they ready for war but they ain't killers
Get it popping you won't feel a thing, we're pain killers
Made niggas that made figures, straight flippers
Boss type, doozies that off white, that's beige nigga
To gain riches but look what being inslaved did us
Dog eat dog mentality that remained with us
Yeah and the indigenous the same, replaced cotton with shottin' was picking up the cane
That dopamine flow, make 'em feel it in they veins
Wolves in sheep clothing I'm similar to Bane.

[Hook: P.A.P.I (NORE)]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, the skully on in the summer time
Drop car in the winter time, I'm with my foreign niggas
We on a foreign grind, spending foreign money, foreign cars
Foreign wine...Foreign niggas, thats what it is!
Foreign niggas, I said what it is? Foreign niggas, what it is!
Foreign niggas, I said what it is?

[Verse 3: Mayhem]

Late flights and runways
Came a long way from blade fights and gunplay
From them young dames, May gets dumb brain
Let they faces catch them cum stains I got one aim!
Rolex GNS no ice on that cost a grip yeah, vice or a python
BSBD beats I can glide on, icon, illuminate when that mic on!
Currency, I'm talkin pounds, euros, yen, dollars
God creates, Jesus saves, if you spend holla
And been hotter so them 10's swallow
Ain't nuttin sweet when I hit it this ain't pi√±ata!
All onboard as we cruise thru shores
U couldn't walk in my shoes, dude ur boots too small
White, green, crack, heroin I've moved it all
FN, 1 hand gun, that can shoot thru walls!

[Hook: P.A.P.I (NORE)]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, the skully on in the summer time
Drop car in the winter time, I'm with my foreign niggas
We on a foreign grind, spending foreign money, foreign cars
Foreign wine...Foreign niggas, thats what it is!
Foreign niggas, I said what it is? Foreign niggas, what it is!
Foreign niggas, I said what it is?
