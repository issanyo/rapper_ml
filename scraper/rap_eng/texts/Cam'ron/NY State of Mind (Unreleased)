[Intro: Billy Joel sample]
Some folks like to get away, take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But I'm taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind

[Verse 1: Fat Joe (sample)]
Woooooooooooo, wee!
Yeah, uhh, yo
It's Cook Coke, ready rock, heard the name before
Arm 'em up, send 'em out, that's what they blame me for
Lay the pressure game quite flat
The last thing you wanna say is you'll be right back
Won't be stunting when them cannons burst
And I make you one with the planet Earth
It's the cycle of life, reimburse you and hearse you to Christ
You don't wanna see my work with a knife
Yes I'm a hustler's hustler, a crackamatician
Took my act down a clack-a-lac, had an addiction
Getting paper was my only high
Just me and my money, guess I'm a lonely guy (hahaha)
And yes I'm so fly, and I'm arrogant too
Can't blame me, see I grew up just as poor as you
And I'm the truth, so it's impossible to talk a lie
I bet they name me king before my demise, cause I'm
(I'm in a New York state of mind)

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
The girl's back in the building, BX we back on the map
See I'm a beautiful bitch, that just happen to rap
The right rhyme to the right one, the late great Big Pun
True official nigga, damn we miss you nigga
Rest in peace, and though you gone, we know you here in spirit
If they don't feel it, I know that they hearing in my lyrics, shit
I never worry, and I'm forever glory
And when I die my little son is gonna tell my story
Tried to ignore it, but they always stressing me
It's like they wanna see me cry, tryin to make me bleed
I got my, pride, that's somethin they can't take from me
I'd rather die before they see me on my fucking knees
Look in my eyes and tell me there's a chick that's touching me
You's a fucking lie, motherfuckers can't get enough of me
Luckily I know that I'm great, got my mind straight
I be O-T with a NY mind state, nigga

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Killa, uh
Coke we move in Nevada, you who, hoot, and you holla
Aluminium, doing 'em
Boom(?), a human pinata
We consuming them dollars
Hula-hoops on the coupe, new to scoop on the boots
You assuming they Prada
They Ferragamo, tato, we got more pride
Mano a mano, business where ya whore hides
Get them sore thighs, she like my .45
And my .45 same color as fluoride
I got more rides, glide, we some raw buyers
Listen to Kan', you 'bout to get ya jaw wired
This is war war 'til you niggas call sire
D.O.A., call M.O.P., I need more FIYYYAH!!
That's Billy and Fizzy, them niggas really get busy
It'll be really a rizzy, Mac-milli, silly on sizzies
Chinchilly when chilly
I just grin, I gotta be winning
They all biting, Manilly Vanillies
I just drive 'em really bonkers
When I cop that silly Tonka
Toy truck-like size, they say I really conquered (what else?)
Live in Harlem, play the Bronx
Them hills in Yonkers
I ain't just big Will, nigga I'm Willy Wonka
No Charlie or chocolate, just (?) a profit
DS, TS, probably a mob hit, Killa

[Outro: Cam'ron]
Killa
Dipset, Terror Squad
Joey Krills, Macho, Remy
Santana, Jim Jones
Bronx, Harlem, Uptown
You already know what it is, man
We own this shit
The Don of Dons, get at me Crack
