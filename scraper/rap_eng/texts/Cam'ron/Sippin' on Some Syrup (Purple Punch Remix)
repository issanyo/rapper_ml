[Verse 1: D.J. Paul]
See I'm a surp sipper, a wig splitter
Your wife got mad at me cause I feel asleep and didn't hit her
We mix it in the two liters and add the candy
Shake it up, loosen the top, remove the panties
[?]
It keeps a player rock hard for the wedding [?]
I'm riding in a diplomat with my Diplomats
I got them surp and the dro, lolli pops [?]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Juicy J be sipping on this stuff they call lean
If I'm out of 'surp I'm on that stuff they call green
I'm straight up from the Memphis where we players on the scene
And messing with the fishscales and have your arms bleed
We like that Houston, Texas yeah we like our music slow
And mix them rainbow colours in the cup and hit the road
We [?] rapping at a show
I tell you purple punch is the next thing to blow

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
I can't get with you sissies
Take a sip of the sizzy
Mix it with Crystal, I'm pissy
Dizzy, dizzy give me quickly
Like they slid me a mickie
Now I slid off with Mickie's, Mandy, Mallory
Maya, I'm slick like I'm Ricky
Take a pic cause I'm picky
Suck my dick through my dickies
Put a condom on first nothing itchy to get me
Get me, now get the picture
Quarter pitcher, Audemar [?]

[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
You know what I twist on
You know what I sip on, sizzurp
Good head, lip on like you don't know what I drip on
You don't even Kelly know that I piss sauce
Every chick I'm throwing my dick on
And listen homes, it's not a problem to date you
Especially now I don't reached my alcohol tolerance level
Too much of that purple puff
Too much of that purple punch
Mixed together, I done had too much of that purple stuff
