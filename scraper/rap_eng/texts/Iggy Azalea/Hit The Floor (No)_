[Chorus]
Shot the beat and hit the floor
What is hitting for?
Copped a cotton candy mink
I live in Cali though
You think it's sick i know
I been that bitch i know
Lost some Ben Franks 'long the way
But i don't miss 'em though

[Verse 1]
You think it's sick i know
I been that bitch i know
We don't know one that know yours no (No no no no!)
They be acting like, they be getting dough (No!)
Only question is what you pull up broke for? (Why do that?)
They be acting like, they done got the bag (No! Oh!)
Yeah right, how the hell your pockets flat (How the hell?)
Y'all ain't really got that guap
Y'all ain't really got that sack (No!)
Y'all ain't got the camera in the plate
Looking at you when the car back-back (Hold up!)
Y'all ain't got snow on your wrists
Y'all ain't got a semi in your fleet (Hold up!)
I would never do it like that
And i bet you can't do it like this (No! Shit!)

[Chorus]
Shot the beat and hit the floor
What is hitting for?
Copped a cotton candy mink
I live in Cali though
You think it's sick i know
I been that bitch i know
Lost some Ben Franks 'long the way
But i don't miss 'em though

[Hook x4]
Hell, nah!
Bitch, no!
Girl you broke!
We don't want champs, no!

Hell nah!
Fuck nah!
Bitch no!
Shit!
