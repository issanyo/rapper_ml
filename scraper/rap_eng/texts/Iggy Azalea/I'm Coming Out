[Intro:]
I'm, coming out
I'm coming
I'm, coming out, ooh

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea)
I-G-G-Y-A Z-A, L in the middle like morning to the EA
All of my exes mad cause they was playing
So I hit my home girls and told â€˜em I can't stay in
Spotlight stuck on me, that's how it seems
Stepping out, Diana Ross, no Supremes
See it took about an hour just to fit it in these jeans
And I don't see you nowhere in future or the seams
I bet you're wishing that you had me back
A new mindframe now when the catch attracts
So, could you please holla at me when the cash is stacked?
And I heard the new girl that you have was whack
I got that web wet water spout, what you hollering about?
Money talk, keep quiet, baby, let your dollars shout
And I've got what you want, bet I'm never running out
Checking in, then straight for the Benz, I'm coming out like..

[Hook:]
I'm coming out, I've got my girls tonight
It's time we take control!
Baby, you're coming!
I'm coming out, I've got my girls tonight
It's time we take control!
I'm coming!

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole]
For too long I put up with your lies
And your lame alibis
No more, no more!
For too long you kept me in the dark
I won't let you break my heart
No more, no more!
I'm calling my girlfriends
They're all telling me move on, move on!
Girl, it just ain't working!
So be out by the weekend
Pack up all your
I'm gone, I'm gone, cause you just don't deserve it!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Keyshia Cole]
I'm so wrong to think that I would change
I will let you run your game no more, no more!
I was so wrong to get a second chance
But I finally understand, no, no, no!
I'm calling my girlfriends!
I'm calling my girlfriends
They're all telling me move on, move on!
Girl, it just ain't working!
So be out by the weekend
Pack up all your
I'm gone, I'm gone, cause you just don't deserve it!

[Hook]
