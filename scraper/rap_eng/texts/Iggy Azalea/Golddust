[Hook x2]
It’s like gold dust
You hear me coming through your speakers
You see me mashing up your airwaves
I know you can’t get enough of my sound

[Verse 1]
I’m blasting on your system, your new single, I missed it
I ride the beat like a disk jockey
I’m winning the race like I fixed it
I'm the main course and the fixings
Bitch, listen!

[Interlude]
(I know you can’t get enough of my sound)

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, bitch! Hold up, hold up, who you’re talking to?
I get several thousand dollars everytime I’m walking through
And the fireworks, here they come too
The waitress bought a light show it's like
(Gold dust, they hear me coming through your..)
Gold hoops and my gold chain
Gold medals, no second place, that silver shit just don’t fit
And that bronze shit, just ain’t my taste!
Talking bad about you, wouldn't make sense
Cause you way up under my rank
Watch these gold bars in my verses, turn into gold bars in my bank

[Hook x2]
