[Verse 1: Katy B]
What does it take to make you feel, get you excited
To see you smile?
What does it take to see my world, I know you'll like it
For once go wild
Baby, but you're so cool with me, be free, yeah
Come see the sights
Lover, there's a city you've never seen before
Come live by night

[Chorus: Katy B]
What's it gonna take for me to see you get down, yeah?
Get, get down yeah
Get down yeah
(Let's go)
Get down yeah
Get down yeah
Get down yeah

[Verse 2: Katy B]
What does it take to feel that beat, let it inside you
Touch your soul?
What does it take to just let the rhythm guide you
And take control?
Baby, don't be scared, don't be self-conscious
Close your eyes
Lover, are you feeling light as a feather?
Ready to fly

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Top of the penthouse, come party with us
Lose control, I heat up when we touch
Take flight, tonight belongs to us
I'll be your drug, come get high, feel my rush
Baby, baby, let's get crazy
Maybe I'll introduce you to amazing
Show me your wild side, I'll be your Vegas
Don't hold back, it's yours for the taking

[Verse 1: Katy B]

[Chorus: Katy B]

[Outro: Katy B]
Get down yeah
Get down yeah
Get down yeah
Get down yeah
