Kill these hoes with my southern flow
Looks so good and I'm flying here
Soaring high like an eagle, ho
Baddest bitch in my hemisphere

Drugs, the camp and I'll let you know
Saved every song so you can hear
I'm the leader of my circle
I'm the head of my peers
I'm the leader of the ladies
Let's get this clear
That's how we rock

10 million sold when I drop
10 million flows, think she hot
10 million hoes in my drop
10 million pounds, watch my clock
10 million years at the top
My time will start today, Nicki paved the way
Kim, Foxy, Eve, now I can't stop, uh

[Hook]
Get your Styrofoam cups, raise 'em high
Let 'em know it's Team Iggy, bitch, till you die
Gets your tats, get your shirts
Let the world see who running this
Let 'em know you belong to me
Lo, lo, lock ups make 'em lean
I got vacants on my chain
You, you can't mess with my team, I got vacants on my chain
I, I, I, I live the dream, I got vacants on my chain

[X2]
Wa, wa, wa, walk with the queen
I got vacants on my chain
Lo, lo, lock ups make em lean I got vacants on my chain
You, you can't mess with my team
I got vacants on my chain

Drop top that Mercedes, man
Peez weed gets crazy
Drop thousands on my baby
I been living as of lately
At the palms I drop 180
And my ghost'a do 180
Here's 180, here's 180

They shut 'em down - computer's baby
Cause I'm trying to get paid
Hey, Neil, I swear they can't fade
Hey, George, we got it all made
Hey, shouts to all my gays
Hey shout to all my bitches and all my fans that's just misunderstood
I work for y'all, they can't hate us, yo it's all good

[Hook]
Gets your tats, get your shirts
Let the world see who running this
Let 'em know you belong to me
La la lock ups make 'em lean
I got vacants on my chain
You, you can't mess with my team, I got vacants on my chain
I, I, I, I live the dream, I got vacants on my chain

[X2]
Wa, wa, wa, walk with the queen
I got vacants on my chain
Lo, lo, lock ups make em lean I got vacants on my chain
You, you can't mess with my team
I got vacants on my chain
