[Verse 1: SauceLordRich]
Most of these niggas are under my vision
Guns, guns, guns,  girls under no supervision
You don't know half of my limit, retarded like Timmy
She bust like a semi, let's take a trip to my city
You show me your titties, head and get tail like a penny
I'm tripping, I'm tripping, I'm tripping, I'm tripping, I'm tripping
She mixing coke with the Henny, I keep some girls who won't pop it for plenty
But they gon' pop it for Envy, she take a pop of that molly
An addict like Kravitz, make that girl pop at the Lenny
Whores looking for a nigga like Lord, Lord but there ain't that many
Phil has that still worth of bills than she will work
Nina make a profit if she pop you like a pill Perc
Do what you will birds, shoot you like I'm Spielberg
But I might let you live cause I got...

Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Bad ass like a honey drum
Looking like a bag of money, bet you want you some
Yeah, you want some, yeah, you want you some
Yeah, I got it, if you want it, bitch show me some
Clap for me, no Ovay, if you got a man then that’s okay
No handcuffing, there's no way, it's murder business, don't OJ
And that ass thick just like Trina, know he start sweating when he seen her
And I want that but don't need him, I'mma throw him down when I leave him, yeah
She got a chopper like she on the front line, so pull up on it just like one time
That's the sound of the pigs, she might just have to do a bid
For having...

[Hook: SauceLordRich & Iggy Azalea]
Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word
Guns in the crib, word

[Verse 3: Sauce Lord Rich]
All the drugs got me tripping balls
Yeah, I button down like a raptor
End of times like a rapture
Send some shots we send them back at you
Send some shots we send them back at you
Iggy, Iggy bring the map with you
All they money bring it back with you
You a lame I can’t deal with you
We ain’t playing pretty pat with you
Ain't no surrounding, no caps at you
Ain’t no retreat that’s a lateral
I like to keep a mystique
Like I’m blue or something
Got you confused like you’re new or something
Looking around for a clue or something
Grant every wish like I’m Jew or something
Guns in the crib but they doing nothing
No mean, no
