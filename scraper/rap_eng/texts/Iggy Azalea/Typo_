Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

[Verse ?]
Why you so pressed, get lil baby to a therapist!
Aye, I do it, I do it, I do it
I said it, I'm in it, I'll prove it
Big dealing, gotta recruit them
Keep winning til you feel stupid

[Chorus]
Show if dope Iggy great, TYPO
Bring around the Rosie, you don't even know me
Ashes, ashes, these bitches phoney

[Verse ?]
I care 'bout nothing but my bitches and my dawgs
'Cause as soon as they all talk, my Azaleans'll call
Save your 4-1-1, it's a 9-1-1
I still count for 3, everything that I've ever done
No regrets from me (Hey)

[PRE-Chorus?]
Put up your hands, get your shit, hope you have fun
