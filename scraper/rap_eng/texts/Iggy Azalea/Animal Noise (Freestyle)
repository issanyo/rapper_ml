[Intro: Bro Safari]
You won't believe this

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
I wanna take it to a new level
Rolex and a new bezel
Cameras flash everywhere I walk now
It even sounds like money when I talk now
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
First class when I dash
Ain't no other rappers near me
Just to get this type of paper
I might need customs to clear me
Bought some Cartiers just to see the haters clearly
Playing while i'm workin'
Ten thousand for a Birkin
You on Instagram lurkin', prayin' that we meet in person
Imma boss, you a turnin' model, shake, get it perfect
Bitch you look like Ms. Piggy
We like where the hell is Kermit?
I'm in position to kill it
Give a damn if you feel it
I was thinking about buyin' this car
You ain't in the building
Mind on my millions
Ain't got no time for no feelings
I come from the bottom baby
I need my money on ceilings
New classic, the new killa
Lookin' in gold mirrors
And feelin' like who's realer?
Wonderin' who's iller than the illest bitch alive
Find me someone, i'll be surprised
Stamps all in this passport
Shot glasses in Glasgow
Feelin' like what more could we ask for
Talkin' that shit cause i'm an asshole (uhn)
Fly as hell in this new Chanel
Pounds of [?]
I can't stand next to a basic
Cause ain't nothin' about me basic
Y'all know what I been on
Y'all know that I been on
Mass murder these beats
Kill everything that I get on
Perfect when I get my spit on
Small talk I don't trip on
Rocking that Versace
Can Iggy Iggy get a big on?
