[Verse 1]
I only got five motherfuckers saved in my phone
Everybody else blocked
I'm goin' through five court cases, goddamn go home
I win, this ain't gon' stop
I'll be the underdog, so fuck it, woof, woof
Ain't nobody think I'd make it so, bye
You should take a sec to learn who I am
Before they talk fuck shit like a hotline
Never put my chest out ever like I'm the best
Lost friends by the loads, they didn't try to flex
While I'm on the helicopter flyin' skylines
Your ass shoppin' at CVS

[Pre-Chorus]
Fake people wanna kick it like they Liu Kang
As if I'm blinder than a bat, look at Bruce Wayne
How the hell am I the villain? I became Bane
They tryna take my head off, Ichabod Crane
Fuckin' hard bein' Iggs, I ain't ever vain
But I do have a vine if I need to swing
Out the motherfuckin' way when the lies come
In your ass where you put your opinion, uh

[Chorus]
You need people like me to get through your day
Got my name all in your mouth, how does it taste?
Got someone for you to meet
Got someone for you to meet
Not the pinkie or the ring boy, but a bird who speaks
Say hi to the middle man, hello to the bad guy
Say hi to the middle man, hello to the bad guy
Say hi to the middle man, hello to the bad guy
Say hi to the middle man, ayy, say hello to the bad guy

[Verse 2]
What you mean I don't write my lyrics?
I'm not real rap, I don't talk about feelings?
You are a trap queen on fleek all summer
I'm tryna understand why it change when I come out
Is this about image? Do I need permission?
To love hip-hop, pay word to Stevie J
Can't help that I rap, oh my accent's fake?
Guess I'm Joseline, they gon' talk anyway, way
Life move fast so I drive slow
And my life move fast so I drive slow
Uh, ain't tryna say I'm not a pop star
Like Jay say, "Ayy, you are who you fuckin' are"
Uh, and I ain't tryna change that
Million dollar bills ain't tryna change that
Never had the feelin', take a sip of this tack
You want me to leave you, along with the stacks

[Pre-Chorus]
Fake people wanna kick it like they Liu Kang
As if I'm blinder than a bat, look at Bruce Wayne
How the hell am I the villain? I became Bane
They tryna take my head off, think about cryin'
Fuckin' hard bein' Iggs, I ain't ever vain
But I do have a vine if I need to swing
Out the motherfuckin' way when the lies come
In your ass where you put your opinion, uh

[Chorus]
You need people like me to get through your day
Got my name all in your mouth, how does it taste?
Got someone for you to meet
Got someone for you to meet
Not the pinkie or the ring boy, but a bird who speaks
Say hi to the middle man, hello to the bad guy
Say hi to the middle man, hello to the bad guy
Say hi to the middle man, hello to the bad guy
Say hi to the middle man, ayy, say hello to the bad guy

[Interlude]
"It's not real rap, rap, like, that's the pop shit, you gotta do some like corny shit"
"I'm tired of listening to her on the radio like all the time, unfortunately, my kids love her though"
"Ayy, where the fuck did she learn to talk like that? Is she taking an Ebonics class?"
"You're Australian, but you're like a white rapper, like you can rap but..."

[Chorus]
You need people like me to get through your day
Got my name all in your mouth, how does it taste?
Got someone for you to meet
Got someone for you to meet
Not the pinkie or the ring boy, but a bird who speaks
Say hi to the middle man
(Hello) Hello to the bad guy
