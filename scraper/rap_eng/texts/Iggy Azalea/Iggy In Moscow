Listen, I hope you're listening
Dismissing my opposition
Good riddance to all you bitches
I'm finished with all you bitches
I'm cooking, I said I'm cooking
Fresh out the pot
Now you looking
I got you looking
You want my spot

I mean it's one for the haters, one for the road
Literally, bitch!
I let her go
You ain't got a name
I let you go..
Whoop that trick - Hustle Flow
Do you really, really wanna go?

You take one, shit, I take 40 - Producer O.V.O
Think you know all about me like Wiki, ho?
All you do is Dream like you was Christina Mili
I'm sorry, Nicki, but these hoes disrespecting hard
Had to address the nonsense, here's a postcard..

Smell aroma
I kill these hoes
At least they'd know they're not tricked out
Put beats in comas
Rhymes so sick
Words [?]

You're defeated before you speak it
Now deleted
End of your plan
In time you will all see
I'm so fresh, man

Your mouth frontin' hey
It get tackled
Mac logo, bitch
Second home the Big Apple

Who want beef, ho?
I heard cattle
Bury bitches in the sand
I'm making sand castles

Very likely that I'll reach a high, insane
So I hope you got a rain coat
Ready for this rain
Hang yourself
Stop
Let me get this cake
Better luck next time
Oh, its my time
You're gonna feel my Rage

And leave, rake, leave - fall
Heel bottoms look like crime scene - Ball!
Red bottoms
Fans? Got 'em
Getting in these bitches ass, yeah - Sodom

I'm dope as a rapper on a millie
Bank account in a week, about a milli
George, book me for a million shows
New Classic. Take over. Straight beast mode
