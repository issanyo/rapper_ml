[Intro]
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
High level so me and all ya'll not

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Right
Stepped in this bitch, whole outfit lookin like a freak show
Still kick game, man this be the flow I make bread off
If you ain’t getting money then don’t get involved
Better leave me alone, you be better off
I been getting money, ain’t set and ya'll spittin that Rico shit that like a bubble off aye
Red dots for the head shot
Yeah the boy kinda short but the bread not
And I fly through the bench, I’mma fuck till I’m rich
I’mma give her that dick and a finger, ho look
Like hell I’m supposed to do with all this work?
I’mma need a kick stand for all this purp
Back when you tumbling papers in trash
I was pushing something foreign, 2-20 on the dash like

[Hook]
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
Look at me, man you starin at dough
I hear what ya'll on, no comparing that though
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Stepped in this bitch, whole outfit lookin like a millie oh for really though?
Can’t get to where I’m at, now these silly hoes studying my motion in my videos
Purse worth bands so it’s only right I got it
Know the haters watchin', I could give a damn about 'em
Swear I got a pair of heels longer than your dick
If your money work magic, my pussy do tricks
Getting million dollars out of rap like it’s Mossie bitch
Got 'em going down under on some Aussie shit
I’m the baddest bitch, boy no argument
And if you ain’t with that business then who are you with?
If I’m ridin would you know that I could change your life
But don’t be going dubbie dubbie tryna change my name
Cause I’m on the top floor where the feelings ain’t allowed
If the Igg do it big tell me how you love me now
New classic

[Hook]
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
Look at me, man you starin at dough
I hear what ya'll on, no comparing that though
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Still in the war with a rap jet
Dunkin' at some pussy you ain’t tapped yet
I don’t give a damn bout none of ya'll niggas
AK got a shot in for everyone ya'll niggas aye
Did my money on European time now
New Rolls and a penthouse nigga
My suspicion niggas always snitchin'
And that’s why I never be around niggas
Put the word on the tape
Best kept secret, I speak it with no debate
They say you got it first, getting love and lover's hate
So even if you don’t know shit you know it’s straight
My brother had a case and he did that time
And I am my brother’s keeper so his problems is mine
Fully loaded clip, you want a problem with mine?
Go hard nigga, put it all on the line like

[Hook]
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
Look at me, man you starin at dough
I hear what ya'll on, no comparing that though
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
This here that high level
So me and all ya'll not eye level
