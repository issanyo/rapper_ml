[Intro: Jennifer Hudson]
He ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 1: Jennifer Hudson]
You should listen to the shit your boyfriend says
Search high and low inside his dirty mind
Then concentrate on making his hot brains
Find your treasure, make it last forever now

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Get what you want in more pleasure
Leave no one, y'all come together
Whisper in his ear and it makes it hotter
Don't wipe the sweat, it makes it better
Let him come when when he wants
Don't hit him with questions
Ask my other girls
Trust me girl don't stress him

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Hudson]
There's so much to learn from what your boyfriend says
Take advantage when he thinks you're not listening
Sure to stay in tune with his pleasure trigger
It's love that he will beg for, that's your mission

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Get what you want in more pleasure
Leave no one, y'all come together
Whisper in his ear and it makes it hotter
Don't wipe the sweat, it makes it better
Let him come when when he wants
Don't hit him with questions
Ask my other girls
Trust me girl don't stress him

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
What you know about blowing 'bout 20 racks
Ain't worried bout him coming back if he going out
Got him wrapped 'round my fingertips
I'm rock hard every time that he can't get it
Make him wanna change it up
And I only feel forgiving if he changes up
See that, Bonnie and Clyde never strange to us
Cause what's life if you never live dangerous?
And when it ain't much left, we get it right
And since love is a drug, he won't get a light
I never been the kind to tuck in a kid at night
I'm all to take you out and tell you "Go and get a sitter tight"
Get it like this, like that, and I owe you one
Boy I ain't trying to hear it when you talking from
See I know your weak spots so I always go there
And I bet that's the reason he ain't goin' nowhere
Like uh

[Interlude: Jennifer Hudson]
Now I told you
Girl he ain't goin' nowhere

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Get what you want in more pleasure
Leave no one, y'all come together
Whisper in his ear and it makes it hotter
Don't wipe the sweat, it makes it better
Let him come when when he wants
Don't hit him with questions
Ask my other girls
Trust me girl don't stress him

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)
He ain't movin' (Ooh, he ain't goin' nowhere)
