[Pre-Chorus]
I shoulda been left
I coulda been crept
You're flirting with death (Yeah)
Boy, you're flirting with death
Tell me how you gon' live with yourself
When I'm fuckin' on somebody else...

[Chorus]
Fuckin' on somebody else, somebody else
Give this pussy to somebody else, somebody else
I be fuckin' with somebody else, somebody else
Give this lovin' to somebody else, somebody else

[Verse 1]
I can't believe it
How many times have I told myself that I would leave
And still I ain't leave you
How many times Imma go back and forth and convince myself I really need you
Fuck that I'm done with that shit
I have no use for excuses
So I may excuse you whenever you come with that shit
Silly of you to think I can't go find me a new you
Cause yes I did want you but I was fine before I knew you
And yes I'm aware that was back a long time ago
It won't take no time to get where I'm tryin' to go
I'm just gon' get myself back and then level up
But I still need back them calls and them bezels chump
Sometimes I just think to myself...

[Pre-Chorus]
I shoulda been left
I coulda been crept
You're flirting with death (Yeah)
Boy, you're flirting with death
Tell me how you gon' live with yourself
When I'm fuckin' on somebody else...

[Chorus]
Fuckin' on somebody else, somebody else
Give this pussy to somebody else, somebody else
I be fuckin' with somebody else, somebody else
Give this lovin' to somebody else, somebody else

[Verse 2]
I'm 'bout to move on to something that's bigger and better
Wait, I hope that you know what I mean babe
When I say it's bigger and better
At first I was tryin' to forget ya
But now it seems it won't take nothin' but time to forget you
Don't care if you fine with the split up (No)
You only mine if I'm with ya (Whoa)
I'm pickin' up, movin' on
I gave you chance after chance
You kept doing wrong
Yeah, you kept doing wrong
Now I'm with somebody who do the things you can't do at all
You better call Tyrone
Whatever you do, just don't call my phone
Cause I got no answers for you
No more chances and romantics for you, yeah
Now that I think about it...

[Pre-Chorus]
I shoulda been left
I coulda been crept
You're flirting with death (Yeah)
Boy, you're flirting with death
Tell me how you gon' live with yourself
When I'm fuckin' on somebody else...

[Chorus]
Fuckin' on somebody else, somebody else
Give this pussy to somebody else, somebody else
I be fuckin' with somebody else, somebody else
Give this lovin' to somebody else, somebody else

[Bridge]
When you hear about it, it's gon kill you
When you see me with him, it's gon kill you
When you think about it, it's gon' kill you
Straight to voicemail, it's gon' kill you
And screenshots, it's gon' kill you
On Instagram with those jeans on and no ring on
It's gon' kill you

[Chorus]
Fuckin' on somebody else, somebody else
Give this pussy to somebody else, somebody else
I be fuckin' with somebody else, somebody else
Give this lovin' to somebody else, somebody else

Fuckin' on somebody else, somebody else
Give this pussy to somebody else, somebody else
I be fuckin' with somebody else, somebody else
Give this lovin' to somebody else, somebody else
