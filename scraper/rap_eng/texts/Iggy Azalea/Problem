Head in the clouds
Weight on my shoulders
Head in the clouds

Hey baby even though I hate ya!
I wanna love ya
I want you! (you you)
And even though I can't forgive you
I really want ta
I want you! (you you)

Tell me, tell me baby
Why can't you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
I want you! (you you)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya!
I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
But it's you! (you you)
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back
But it's you! (you you)
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
But it's you! (you you)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya!
I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got one less, one less problem
