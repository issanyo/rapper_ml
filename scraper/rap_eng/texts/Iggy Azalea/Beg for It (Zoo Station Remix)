[Intro: MØ]
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg...

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby
High price, but I'm worth it, baby
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby
Gettin' faded in the European, swervin', ay
Look, describe Iggy groundbreaking what the word is
Hit the stage, ass shakin' like I'm nervous
When in New York, I be parkin' right on Madison
This ain't no accident, I'm killing 'em on purpose
I-G-G-Y did she just have to do it?
Baby ride with me, fly living, there ain't nothing to it
And my waist slim, ass fat, you gotta have it
Yeah, my bake on, cake long, that's automatic

[Hook: MØ]
I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make it, I'mma make it, I'mma make you beg for it
(I'mma make it, I'mma make it, I'mma make you beg for it)
I'mma make you beg for it

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
P-P-P-Pussy power, pay me by the hour
I need me a Braveheart, can't deal with a coward
I tell him if he ain't ballin', he should hit the showers
If I pick you, you lucky, baby, this money ours
All yellow gold on me, like I'm Trinidad (James)
Sittin' drop top, wondering where the ceiling's at
I know my old thang wanna bring the feeling back
But I got a new thang, baby, I ain't feeling that now
Iggy Iggy Iggy, can't you see?
That everybody wanna put they hands on me
See I be on this money while your man on me
And I need another hand with all these bands on me, wait

[Hook: MØ]
I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make it, I'mma make it, I'mma make you beg for it
(I'mma make it, I'mma make it, I'mma make you beg for it)
I'mma make you beg for it

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea (MØ)]
Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Talking all this trash like blah-de-blah-de-blah
(Oh ay oh) nuh-uh (oh ay oh) nuh-uh (oh ay oh)
Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Make me wanna laugh like har-de-har-de-har
(Oh ay oh) nuh-uh (oh ay oh) nuh-uh

[Hook: MØ]
I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make it, I'mma make it, I'mma make you beg for it
(I'mma make it, I'mma make it, I'mma make you beg for it)
I'mma make you beg for it

[Outro: MØ (and Iggy Azalea)]
Got you hooked boy, I'm like a drug
If you want my love better smoke it up
(Make you beg for it, I'mma make you beg for it)
You can look, boy, but don't you touch
If you want my love better smoke it up
(Make you beg for it, I'mma make you beg for it)
