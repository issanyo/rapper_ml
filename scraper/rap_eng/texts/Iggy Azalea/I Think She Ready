[Intro: Iggy Azalea]
I can't say something funny, I don't know what to say!

[Verse 1: Ray Rich]
I just popped the bean, man
I got that OJ and that weed, time to take flight
Richy might be on that lean mixed with that sprite
They got me rolling, smoking, drinking, I just might die tonight
I just gave a cup to Becky, now thinking that she ready
Ever met C getting nakey, there go Keisha, there she sexy
Ménage à trois if the bitches let me, and I think they gon' let me
One just call me Papi seconds later it's bukkake
She move too A.K.A. first bitch let it spray
Drunk bitch, big tits, motorboats on the way
She say she wanna earn some stripes
Well we about to see if she about that life

[Hook]
Rolling, rolling, rolling, I ain't slept in a week
I got a bad bitch with me and I think she a freak
We about to make a movie girl, get the camera ready
Man it's the fucking minute, I'm thinking that she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Red cup, double stuff, I think she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Taking molly to the dome, I think she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Get here home by the Cove, I think she ready

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Whatever
Okay okay okay
Now I think I'm ready, I rip tracks, spit confetti
She kill raps, lyrics deadly
16 sex, no R.Kelly
That's no diss, a man want Becky
If you tell me you want Becky, give me Brian
That's O'Brain, use your noodle - no spaghetti, ay
Iggy, I'm bossing for dollars, cups of Ciroc on the ice
Sewing these weaves for you hoes, tweet me just name your price
Up all night in a life like this, fans pass out when I kiss
If you hate then you are toast, Not breakfast, keep burning witch
Chain hang, diamonds swang, two red cups my Sprite is mixed
Powder white, face of an angel, where she get that ass thick?
Stop, drop, bottles pop, for-ever, sandlot
Other rappers underground, call them all fraggle rock

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 1st Down]
There's a pretty big bar, I got no manners
Don't blame me, just blame my Daddy, for
For life fort, some may snort, some may bort
They on my caddies, I'm on that E, the roll is me
Me and yo beesh, we bang like rabbits
(And that Cat......Mr. Fantastic)
And that night, we shine so bright, make me feel like I'm on acid
Probably call, shit blue magic, purple brain, I fill my cup
Bitch you know, that my cup ready, it's gettin dark, feel my shark
Act a fool and then I'm game
Take one shot, blunts to the head, all that Remy, got that leg
I feel my heart, I think I'm cray, her booty don't start, or Simon Says
I'm like Big (Girl don't stop with you doin')
You not with me then you losin bitch I'm tryna sing with my movie

[Hook]
