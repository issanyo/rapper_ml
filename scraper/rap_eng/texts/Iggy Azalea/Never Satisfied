[Verse 1]
Wake up, wake up
Don't know who you think you dealin' with, no fake love
Cause you fuckin' with the realest me, no makeup
You're out here swimming with a no-name who take paycuts
Type to call the paparazzi on ya, fake hoe
Says she's not about your pesos, if you say so
These bitches can't do nothin' for you, placebos
I guess it's not my place though, place though

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah I can tell your mom likes me after talks in the kitchen
And you said it's been a while since you had someone who get it
So I know you probably wonder when I might I let you hit it
Well I'll throw that ass back if it becomes a tradition

[Chorus]
I hold it down for you when you on the road
Your side of the bed's still cold (he never satisfied)
He still wanna fuck with all the hoes
They don't even cut it close (he never satisfied)
Early in the morning at the stove
Breakfast 'fore you go (he never satisfied)
Yeah, I guess he never satisfied
And I'm running out of time for him

[Verse 2]
Not to mention I'm a rich bitch with the fattest ass
And my house big with a lot of plaques
Twenty-seated jet, and I pay the tab
Just to come and cook you eggs and then I take it back
Who else you know gon' walk the tightrope
Front row, the show, make Vogue, then switch coats
So into you, she swerves and curves dudes
And knows how it feels to walk in your shoes
That shit is very rare (very rare)
I would hate to see you lose a solitaire (solitaire)
Best be on your P's and Q's to keep her there
And if she linkin' halfway, I will meet her there

[Chorus]
I hold it down for you when you on the road
Your side of the bed's still cold (he never satisfied)
He still wanna fuck with all the hoes
They don't even cut it close (he never satisfied)
Early in the morning at the stove
Breakfast 'fore you go (he never satisfied)
Yeah, I guess he never satisfied

[Bridge]
Yeah, you know I hold it down for you babe
Why you goin' through all ten phases
Where you going to, baby?
Somewhere that you celebrated
Celebrating, should be celebrating, yeah
Celebrating

[Chorus]
I hold it down for you when you on the road
Your side of the bed's still cold (he never satisfied)
He still wanna fuck with all the hoes
They don't even cut it close (he never satisfied)
Early in the morning at the stove
Breakfast 'fore you go (he never satisfied)
Yeah, I guess he never satisfied
And I'm running out of time for him
