[Verse 1]
I been caught up in you and the things you doin'
And I can't lie to ya, I don't even mind
I been tryna get used to how fast life been movin'
And looking for somethin' outside this money to call mine
Tell me, tell me, tell me baby could you be that?
They say love is like a drug
Baby you gon' make me relapse
I got short comings and flaws
But you see me and never see that
And that's what got me tryin' to be everywhere that you be at

[Chorus]
I'm in a haze
And I love it
Not just a phase
This is how I do
I'm in a haze
And I love it
Got no regrets
This is what I wanna do
What I wanna do

What I wanna do...

[Verse 2]
I'm not tryna rush you into nothin'
But I don't wanna waste my time either babe
Cause no matter what
We can't get the time back
So let's not be fightin' crazy every time I see you
Look, ain't no games with me baby
That ain't what I'm into
Lots of baggage 'round us
Fuck what both of us done been through
Short comings and flaws yeah, we got em
But don't see those
Honestly baby, who needs those?

[Chorus]
I'm in a haze
And I love it
Not just a phase
This is how I do
I'm in a haze
And I love it
Got no regrets
This is what I wanna do
What I wanna do

What I wanna do...

[Bridge]
Long as you know that it's timeless
I'll play it cold like the ice in my necklace
Got a big ego, I'm not tryna hide it
I'm a pretty pony
But boy can you ride it?
You caught me red handed
Boy you know, love it when you get candid
Getting turned on with ya in the backseat
Down the streets like royalty

[Chorus]
I'm in a haze
And I love it
Not just a phase
This is how I do
I'm in a haze
And I love it
Got no regrets
This is what I wanna do

What I wanna do...

I'm in a haze
And I love it
Not just a phase
This is how I do
I'm in a haze
And I love it
Got no regrets
This is what I wanna do

What I wanna do...
