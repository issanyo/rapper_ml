[Intro: Pharrell & Robin Thicke]
Everybody get up, WOO!
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke]
If you can't hear what I'm trying to say
If you can't read from the same page
Maybe I'm going deaf
Maybe I'm going blind
Maybe I'm out of my mind

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Ok, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But she's an animal
Baby, it's in your nature
Just let me liberate you
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take a

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
What do they make dreams for
When you got them jeans on
What do we need steam for
Iggy, you the hottest bitch in this place!

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Pull out, step up, no line, get in
No frequency, you gon' get in
Get out tonight, the night beginning
Tomorrow night, do this again
If it look this good then it can't be bad
No time for the wife life, can't be there
But if you really doubt what I'm 'bout
Then getcho ass in the back and [?] backing me out
Then it's vroom vroom whenever we want
This success [?] when you said it, and I said I'm one in a million
Round here we moving 'bout much for this feeling
It never feel too good [?]Â put your hands in the ceiling, said!

[Hook: Robin Thicke + (Iggy Azalea)]
She's a good girl
I know you want it
(I know you want me)
I know she wants it, baby
I know you want it
Oh yes, she does
But she's a good girl
That's alright
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines
