[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Been around the world and I, I, I, I can't find my baby
Things gettin' crazy, losin' my patience
Why you keep me waitin'
Goin' through the phases
Got me walkin' out the house all done up
Just in case I see your face and you decide to run up
Yeah, I'm in a different place, I need someone to hold on to
I been sendin' up a prayer hope the call gets through

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
'Cause my heart beats for you only
I wonder if you even know me
Countin' down every moment
That I wait for ya, I wait for ya
I wonder if you even notice
Lately I've been feelin' hopeless
Easy to lose focus, but I'll wait for ya...

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I've been looking for a savior
I've been looking for a savior
I've been looking for a hero in my corner
I've been looking for a savior, a savior, to save me

[Post-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I've been looking for a savior, a savior, to save me

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I feel like God playin' tricks on me, got a fix on me
Feel the weight of the world like I got a brick on me
Had a dance with the devil and he got a grip on me
I'm just tryna get to heaven, hope you got a ticket for me, uh
If I'm Lois Lane, where's my Superman?
I need you faster than a bullet or a speedin' train
And when you find your way to me then I won't need a thing
And I can't wait until the day that we can meet again

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
'Cause my heart beats for you only
I wonder if you even know me
Countin' down every moment
That I wait for ya, I wait for ya
I wonder if you even notice
Lately I've been feelin' hopeless
Easy to lose focus, but I'll wait for ya...

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I've been looking for a savior
I've been looking for a savior
I've been looking for a hero in my corner
I've been looking for a savior, a savior, to save me

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
Savin' my love for you, savin' my love for you (savin' it)
Savin' it all for you, savin' it all for you, all for you
Savin' my love for you, savin' my love for you (savin' it)
Savin' it all for you, savin' it all for you

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I've been looking for a savior
I've been looking for a savior
I've been looking for a hero in my corner
I've been looking for a savior, a savior, to save me

[Post-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I've been looking for a savior, a savior, to save me
