[Intro]
It's Iggy Iggs
Soy J Balvin, man
One less, one less problem

[Verse 1]
Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya
(I want you)
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
(I want you)
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it
(I want you)

[Pre-Hook]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

[Hook]
One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, si
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, si
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

[Verse 2]
I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
(But it's you)
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back
(But it's you)
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
(But it's you)

[Pre-Hook]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

[Hook]
One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, si
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, si
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

[Verse 3]
Okay, It's Iggy Iggs, La Familia, Let's go
Ha, soy J Balvin, man
Si si el periodico de ayer
El que desechaste, eh!
Y ahora vienes a rogarme, que?
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
Recuerdas como de mi tu te reias?
Ahora me buscas en la calle todo el dia
Recuerdas como a mi me maldecias?
Y ahora viajo en Jet privado con la mia

[Bridge]
One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem
[Pre-Hook]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

[Hook]
One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, si
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, si
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

[Outro]
La familia, Let's go
