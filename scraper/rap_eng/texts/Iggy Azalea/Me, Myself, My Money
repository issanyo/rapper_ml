[Hook x2]
They’d buy me shit if they could
Damn, I make it look good
I’m bound to paper like wood
Oh you hating? Yeah, you should
Cause it’s just me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money
Me, myself, my money

[Verse 1]
These Margielas is killing my feet
Versace shades ’cause I’m feeling low key
Case of Ace ’cause the homies with me
No ID they know me
I.G.G. bitch, why you starin?
Chic Lazana I ain’t carin
Might put Daytons on my McLaren
Like damn that white bitch cray
My son is signed, yeah fuck, you payin’
They pay me more ’cause I get shit you one hundred six four
Six oh oh don’t slam that door
Wash MC’s they white like sheets
Crack rock flow bitch cook that dough
Put it in the streets say took that dough
I cook that dough, throw it to the ceiling
It fell on the floor, Iggy you killin’ I already know
Can’t tell me nothing if you already broke I’m already on
Aiming for the stars I’m already gone
Gotta have dinner with a man on the moon
Married to the shit and the money’s my groom
I’m swerving that shit, I ain’t grabbing that broom

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
All wins no losses, life for the boss bitch
All I need is an office, I’m turning shit off
All I need is a coffin
Ridin’ circles while they weezin' and coughin'
Let the bullshit walk, let my money do the talking
Put up runner walk ’cause there’s my target
Roll day driving yeah that’s my target
Pull up, park it no keys shit
Push it start it, shrimp cocktails
In Neiman Marcus, haters salty
Nuts and cashews, I came with Ben and Andrew
We might just ’cause a scandal
Find out that we Minaj our Nicki’s handle
Yeah that’s my ammo, I’m on fire
Just lit the candle, head in sky
Bitch I’m the shit, you should think so too
G shit, just gimme my money
M.O.Y. money over you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
In the land of the milk and honey
I came with some Playboy Bunnies
And Hef just said he's coming
This shit right here's about dollars
To stunt on hoes is my honour
And a bitch must be in hell
If the devil wears Prada
Keep it real they don’t want nada
Getting cheese like enchiladas
You ain’t talking ’bout that money what the fuck you sayin?
I’m cashing out what the fuck you playing, playing, playing
You ain’t talking ’bout that money what the fuck you sayin?
