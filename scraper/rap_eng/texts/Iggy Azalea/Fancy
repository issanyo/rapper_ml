I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh

Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y

I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh
