Lyrics to Iggy Azalea's "7teen" won't be available

[Verse 1]
Talkin' out your gums'll get you drummed (get you drummed)
I pop a wheelie in the Jeep, just for the fun (for the fun)
I hit my neighbor, when I come, that's when you run (when you run)
Like I got some signal, that's just how you run (what you say?)
Where these bitches get they courage, where you from? (Where is you?
Girl, you lyin' through your teeth, you know you front (know you front)
Runnin' to the rum when I cut your tongue (cut your mouth)
Yeah, I bless 'em, they just wanna be the one (what you say? Ayy)

[Chorus]
I ain't wanna play though, I ain't wanna play though (pow)
I'm tryna pull my card, lay it on the table (uh)
I ain't wanna play though, I ain't wanna play though (say it)
I ain't wanna play, shut your mouth (uh)
I will never change where the cash go (go)
Keep my name out your mouth or get strep throat (go)
Meet me in the future, okay, let's go (let's go)
Make them dance around, DJ Esco (sheesh)

[Post-Chorus]
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli
I'm lookin' at seventeen, seventeen milli

[Interlude]
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
That shit crazy, man

[Verse 2]
I'm back with the finessin', nah, fuck a single
I put Chordz on the beat, that's my fuckin' people
Take it back to the crew like it once was (once was)
I swear these meetings every meeting like it's Breakfast Club (Breakfast Club)
What up Charlamagne? Add me to the hall of fame (hall of fame)
They want my Aussie accent, that's a fuckin' shame
They forgot I been here since a fuckin' teen, ayy (fuckin' teen)
Shit was kinda tricky, had to chase my dream

[Chorus]
I ain't wanna play though, I ain't wanna play though (pow)
I'm tryna' pull my card, lay it on the table (uh)
I ain't wanna play though, I ain't wanna play though (say it)
I ain't wanna play, shut your mouth (uh)
I will never change where the cash go (go)
Keep my name out your mouth or get strep throat (go)
Meet me in the future, ok, let's go (let's go)
Make them dance around, DJ Esco (sheesh)

[Post-Chorus]
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli
I'm lookin' at seventeen, seventeen milli
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli
I'm lookin' at seventeen, seventeen milli

[Refrain]
That's how I lead, oh, what you thought?
I gave you some time, now go take a walk
That's how I lead, oh, what you thought?
I gave you some time, now go take a walk

[Verse 3]
I got onyx on fire, magic city is lit
Loose flame on these haters, stroke is holdin' my mix
Tell 'em what, check the spot you just missed
Tell 'em what, check the spot you just missed, talk to me

[Chorus]
I ain't wanna play though, I ain't wanna play though (pow)
I'm tryna' pull my card, lay it on the table (uh)
I ain't wanna play though, I ain't wanna play though (say it)
I ain't wanna play, shut your mouth (uh)
I will never change where the cash go (go)
Keep my name out your mouth or get strep throat (go)
Meet me in the future, ok, let's go (let's go)
Make them dance around, DJ Esco (sheesh)

[Post-Chorus]
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli (sheesh)
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli (sheesh)
Seventeen milli, seventeen milli
I'm lookin' at seventeen, seventeen milli
