[Verse 1:]
No [?]
No hard feelings
No friends here, just business dealings
Got my shit switched to selective hearing
No need for your opinion
No such thing as a [?]
Head is good, its the same thing as a [?]
Sometimes [?]

Second place champ is what I call last
Nobody taught us how to counterfeit
No, we make the money that quick
Make it flip like [?] gymnastics
Make it flip like [?]

[Hook (x2):]
I'mma take you to my sushi bar
I'mma give it to you raw
Cause this what you been wanting, wanting
We can get it going, going, going
Let me know

[Verse 2:]
Everybody like 'ughh'
Why she had to say that for
There's a [?]
Blackout and he like this [?]
Shit on everything that you come from

[?] broke away from the [?]
[?] in the [?]
[?]
Give you one time hit
Better know that

Got [?] comes ready
Top that
Don't sweat my swag
Your bitch no bad
Too sad
Don't sweat my swag

[Hook]
I'mma take you to my sushi bar
I'mma give it to you raw
Cause this what you been wanting, wanting
We can get it going, going, going
Let me know

[Verse 3:]
Don't sweat my swag
No match
Your bitch not bad

Too sad
Don't sweat my swag
No match
Your bitch not bad
