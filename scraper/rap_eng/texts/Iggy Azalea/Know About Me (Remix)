She don't know a thing, she don't know a thing about me
Well, she don't know that I'm on a roll, I'm a motherfucking G

These bitches don't like me, ah, these haters want to fight me, ah
Wake up and get caked up, put these bitches on diets, ah
Wake up and get caked up, wake up and get caked up
Wake up, I turn up

[Instrumental]

Excuse my french, I speak deadly, bread throwing that cheddy
My pocket's nauseous, these ones is vomit, I'm throwing up this confetti
Ugh, I'm spazzing out, and yea I'm going for broke
I'm spazzing out, and yea I'm going for broke

(You don't know) [x4]

She don't know a thing, she don't know a thing about me
Well, she don't know that I'm on a roll, I'm a motherfucking G

She don't know a thing, she don't know a thing about me
Well, she don't know that I'm on a roll, I'm a motherfucking G

These bitches don't like me, ah, these haters want to fight me, ah
Wake up and get caked up, put these bitches on diets, ah
Wake up and get caked up, wake up and get caked up
Wake up, I turn up

[Instrumental]

I turn up

Excuse my french, I speak deadly, bread throwing that cheddy
My pocket's nauseous, these ones is vomit, I'm throwing up this confetti
Ugh, I'm spazzing out, and yea I'm going for broke
I'm spazzing out, and yea I'm going for broke

(You don't know) [x4]
