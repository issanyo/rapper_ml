Reasons to believe don't feel like reasons at all
Love i lie in the dark light me up when you call

[verse?]
Future on the thinest of ice
But we all covered in gold
As we lay in this bed
Room all covered in hope
Dreams of the perfect elope
Don't wake me up if you go
Don't wanna depend on you
Don't wanna be effected by the things you decide to do
I only fear God & loving you
