[Verse 1]
Real life is not hypothetical
I mix the juice with the medical
They say my ass is incredible
They say the pussy so edible (Skkkrrr!)
They put it up on a pedestal
Hold up i'll give you a better view (Shoom!)

They hating i see that they hating
Yeah, you know what the cheddar do (Wow!)
More money than i can count
Make sure they hit my account (Ah, Ah!)
Bitches be running their mouth
I make 'em run in their house (Braaap!)

All the lames riding camels in the sand
Gotta stand next to the fan
Cause bitch i burn it down (Wow!)

[Chorus]
Diablo diablo (Ah, Ah!)
Pull up in that all red Murciélago (Skkrrr!)
Take the PJ out to Cabo (Shoom!)
Then i fly right back to Morro (Oh!)
Diablo diablo (Ah, Ah!)
Pull up in that all red Murciélago (Skkrrr!)
Take the PJ out to Cabo (Shoom!)
Then i fly right back to Morro (Oh!)

Diablo diablo [?] like i'm Paulo
I heat it up wherever i go
Bitch i'm hot just like diablo
Bitch i'm hot, bitch i'm hot
