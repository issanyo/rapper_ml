[Intro:]
(Dirt in her pussy ass bitches)
Alright, how's everybody doing? (Fuck you)
How y'all doing? I'm Starfish, thank you
(...music bitch! hey baby, don't listen to him hey)
Thank you, yea, ok I got somethin'...
I got a lil' poem to share with y'all
It's called "Dirt in Your Pussy Ass Bitch" (uh?)
Y'all ready? (uhh, yea)

[Verse:]
"Hotel room in every city
Panties fall to the floor
Bend you over, arch your back, pull your hair
Yeah, you like that
Dirt in your pussy ass bitch
This is your fifth flight in a month
No cash, just dick in yo' palms
Louis Fakes under your arms
Ignored calls from your moms
Dirt in your pussy ass bitch"
