[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
Tell me what you want
What you like
It's okay
I'm a little curious too
Tell me if it's wrong
If it's right
I don't care
I can keep a secret can... you?

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Got my mind on your body
And your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry
I just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother, shhh
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer
(ha)

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
(Ooh, Ooh)
Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
Cause you and I
We're cool for the summer

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
Tell me if I won
If I did
What's my prize?
I just wanna play with you, too
Even if they judge
Fuck it, I'll do the time
I just wanna have some fun, with you

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Got my mind on your body
And your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry
I just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer
(Ha)

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
(Ooh, Ooh)
Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
Cause you and I
We're cool for the summer
(Ha)
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Get ready, get ready
You say hello, and I say goodnight
You say I been gone, and I say time flies
It’s looking like
Wait it’s looking like, you been looking for me
Like you been checking for me, do you got checks for me?
Love will make you go crazy, love will make you go insane
I’m not your little red corvette, you don’t gotta feed me octane
Don’t gas me up, I’m about to flip more like busta bust
Demi back 'em up, cause yo, we bout to kill em, and dash the dust
Iggs

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Got my mind on your body
And your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry
I just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer
(Ha)

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
(Ooh, Ooh)
Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
Cause you and I
We're cool for the summer
(Ha)
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer]
