[Hook (Lanta)]
I like to go outside when the sky is blue
They see that new Benz they wanna ride with you
All your old friends want to spend time with you
Back then they didn’t want to spend a dime with you

[Bridge (Grey & Lanta)]
It’s crazy how the tables turn
I hope this was your lesson learned
I don’t understand your words
Go and let the fire burn
Let it burn
O let it burn let it burn let it burn
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges
Let it burn
O let it burn let it burn let it burn
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges

[Verse (Lanta)]
Right Now!
Had to burn on my bad bridges
Now I only fuck with Bad bitches
And I only hang with Savages
If you ain’t getting to the bag I ain’t having it
I want all my niggas to be rich
We ain’t talking 9 to 5 shifts Lanta WAV3 I'm a 95 kid
She seen my crib then her eyes opened big

[Bridge (Grey & Lanta)]
It’s crazy how the tables turn
I hope this was your lesson learned
I don’t understand your words
Go and let the fire burn
Let it burn
O let it burn let it burn let it burn
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges
Let it burn
O let it burn let it burn let it burn
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges

[Verse (Grey)]
I ain’t Usher but I had to let it burn
If you was patient then you would’ve had your turn now I
Changed your mind from the money that I earned and I
Know what you heard, yeah got what you deserved yea
Burning bridges like the fire
Bout to spark it up wheres the lighter
Used to be a kid from the city with a dream
Now you want to switch up damn I thought you was the team
They don’t know about loyalty
Niggas watch the throne they ain’t royalty
All these bad bitches tryna to spoil me
But now the bridge is burned

[Bridge (Grey & Lanta)]
It’s crazy how the tables turn
I hope this was your lesson learned
I don’t understand your words
Go and let the fire burn
Let it burn
O let it burn let it burn let it burn
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges
Let it burn
O let it burn let it burn let it burn
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges
Burning all these bad bridges

[Verse (Iggy Azalea)]
