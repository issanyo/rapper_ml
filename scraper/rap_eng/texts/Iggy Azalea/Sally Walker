[Intro:]
J. White, I need a beat, I can't go off, off (woah)

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Lil' Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me
Lil' Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me

[Post-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
I said go on girl do your thang, do your thang, do your thang
Go on girl do your thang, do your thang (stop)
Go on girl do your thang, do your thang, do your thang
Go on girl do your thang, do your thang (drop)
Go!

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Lil' Sally Walker uh, shake it proper uh
Bend it over make it wobble uh, gotta lotta buns
Pick it up and drop it uh, for the proper funds
Anything to make the profit come get them dollars hun
Add that shit up just like mathematics, if you do it for free then it's ass backwards
All of you bitches is mad at me prolly mad cause you ain't in my tax bracket
You bitches is broker than glass cracked you ain't gon' do shit you just act ratchet
Play with me you gon' get back handed

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Lil' Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me
Lil' Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me

[Post-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
I said go on girl do your thang, do your thang, do your thang
Go on girl do your thang, do your thang (stop)
Go on girl do your thang, do your thang, do your thang
Go on girl do your thang, do your thang (drop)
Go!

Watch me throw it back and cooted
They love how..
