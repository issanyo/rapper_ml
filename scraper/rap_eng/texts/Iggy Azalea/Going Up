[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Ljay Currie]
I hit the club, and we got it raining, it's pouring
It's snowing, it's snowing
We be on 10 and you know this
My whole team lit off the potion
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place
It's raining, it's pouring
It's snowing, it's snowing
We be on 10 and you know this
My whole team lit off the potion
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place

[Verse 1: Ljay Currie]
It's a good day to bring the guap out
Bad little bitch with a top out
Got this ice on money 'cause it's hot out
Yeah, it's hot out, it's hot out, it's hot out
I just got the check and I'm lit
I think I might marry my whip
Big quads that don't fit
I swear I just got it for pics
I swear the money make her twerk it
I throw it up and she deserve it
She say she like me as a person
That good D got her lurking

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
It raining, it's pouring
It's snowing, it's snowing
We be on 10 and you know this
My whole team lit off the potion
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place
It's raining, it's pouring
It's snowing, it's snowing
We be on 10 and you know this
My whole team lit off the potion
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
It's too real in this field
But me and mine, we came to kill
Now we be worried 'bout making more millions
We used to be worried 'bout meals
I don't wanna talk to you
I don't wanna see your face
(Ay, I don't even wanna talk to you at all)
I don't keep in touch with my exes
I'm cooling the drama and jealousy
It's always who can get the best of who
But you won't ever get the best of me
And yeah, I saw you at the club last night
You couldn't even get next to me
And I had the club going crazy
I guess a girl got his recipe

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
It raining, it's pouring
It's snowing, it's snowing
We be on 10 and you know this
My whole team lit off the potion
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place

[Bridge: Ljay Currie]
It's a good day to bring the guap out
It's a good day to bring the guap out
It's a good day to bring the guap out
I hit the club and we got it

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Raining, it's pouring
It's snowing, it's snowing
We be on 10 and you know this
My whole team lit off the potion
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place
It raining, it's pouring
It's snowing, it's snowing
We be on 10 and you know this
My whole team lit off the potion
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place
It's going, it's going up
Every time I step in a place
