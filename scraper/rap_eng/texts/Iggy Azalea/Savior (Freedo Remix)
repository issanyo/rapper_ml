[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Been around the world and I, I, I, I can't find my baby
Things gettin' crazy, losin' my patience
Why you keep me waitin'?
Goin' through the phases
Got me walkin' out the house all done up
Just in case I see your face and you decide to run up
Yeah, I'm in a different place, I need someone to hold on to
I been sendin' up a prayer hope the call gets through

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
'Cause my heart beats for you only
I wonder if you even know me
Countin' down every moment
That I wait for ya, I wait for ya
I wonder if you even notice, lately
I've been feelin' hopeless
Easy to lose focus, but I'll wait for ya

[Chorus: Quavo]
I've been looking for a savior (hey)
I've been looking for a savior (hey)
I've been looking for a real one to hold on to (hey)
I've been looking for a savior, savior, yeah, to save me

[Post-Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Quavo]
Ah-ay, na-na (I've been looking for a savior)
Ah-ay, na-na (savior, yeah, to save me)

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I feel like God playin' tricks on me, got a fix on me
Feel the weight of the world like I got a brick on me
Had a dance with the devil and he got a grip on me
I'm just tryna get to heaven, hope you got a ticket for me, huh
I've been sending up prayers, I need feedback
Past full of sin, can someone delete that?
My path got muddy, I feel like my feet trapped
Can you give me the strength now to beat that?

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
'Cause my heart beats for you only
I wonder if you even know me
Countin' down every moment
That I wait for ya, I wait for ya
I wonder if you even notice, lately
I've been feelin' hopeless
Easy to lose focus, but I'll wait for ya

[Chorus: Quavo]
I've been looking for a savior (hey)
I've been looking for a savior (hey)
I've been looking for a real one to hold on to (hey)
I've been looking for a savior, savior, yeah, to save me

[Post-Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Quavo]
Ah-ay, na-na (I've been looking for a savior)
Ah-ay, na-na

[Chorus: Quavo & Iggy Azalea]
I've been looking for a savior (ah-ay, na-na-na)
I've been looking for a savior (ah-ay, na-na-na)
I've been looking for a real one to hold on to
I've been looking for a savior, (ah-ay, na-na-na-aye) savior, yeah, to save me

[Post-Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Quavo]
Ah-ay, na-na-na (I've been looking for a savior)
Ah-ay, na-na-na (savior, yeah, save me)
