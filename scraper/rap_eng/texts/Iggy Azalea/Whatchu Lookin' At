[Verse 1]
All this cash, cash, cash, cash, cash
I seen Sean the other day, he said
"Damn I ain't know you had that
Ass, ass, ass, ass!", leave no questions
I'm Jolie, when I'm on that D, I have you gone in 60 seconds
These bitches don't like me, ah, these haters want to fight me, ah
Wake up and get caked up, put these bitches on diets, ah

Polo should have been my logo, with a jockey around on my coat though
So I got to take 'em back to the drawing board
Cause it's time to make some hits for the mo'mo'
I turn up with my top missing, and hop out in a New Edition

I'm propane, this Hell's Kitchen, my campfire, these smoke signals
Sold some other shit, get these maggots off me
The best is immaculate, attach it slowly
Broads got at where you act, they acting Tony
Fuck you up in the ass, get the alimony, ugh

[Hook]
She don't know, she don't know a thing
She don't know a thing about me
Well, she don't know that I'm on a roll

I'm a motherfucking G, and we long distance
Sipping on biscuits, sipping our tea
We flip them the bird, then let them fly on for free
Watcha lookin' at? Whatcha lookin' at?
Watcha lookin at? Watcha lookin' at?

[Verse 2]
I'm cooling in Italy
And a man could probably a tee, I'm making a scene
If they rolling the camera's, my candids come with a fee
Excuse my french, I speak deadly, bread throwing that cheddy
My pocket's nauseous, these ones is vomit, I'm throwing up this confetti

Ugh, I'm spazzing out, and yea I'm going for broke
I'm gonna ride this wave kind of like a tube on the rope
If you don't like it, I give you something to hold
Here's a D from you to me, you can call it my own

Damn Iggy, damn Iggy, why you so illy
Sewed up, really when the pen in the needle, you gon' feel me
I got my fam with me, going ham, and that's some damn chilling
Take the night off, and with me we gon' ride off, and we gon' ride off

Watcha lookin at? Ugh!
