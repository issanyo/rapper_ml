Twenty-three-year-old Australian rapper Iggy Azalea declared World War III, and then more specifically war against me, about 15 minutes into our phone conversation. She'd just woken up in a London hotel room having performed at Wireless Music Festival the previous day, and I was alone in Oysterâ€™s Sydney office some time close to the witching hour, drinking shitty wine. (This the way the world ends: not with a bang but with a tipple, to paraphrase T. S. Eliot.)
