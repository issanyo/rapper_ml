[Refrain]
Heading for a zillion
Thumbing through a billion
Gotta keep it trillion
What is a million?
Okay
Heading for a zillion
Thumbing through a billion
Gotta keep it trillion
What is a million?
Okay

[Verse 1]
Heading for a zillion
Thumbing through a billion
Gotta keep it trillion
What is a million?
What the fuck is a million?
Gotta stack bread, home pride to the ceiling, uh
All my bitches say let’s get it on
One time for my bitches that can get it on
Represent for the ladies that be working
Who we schooling? Who you ruling?
Pussy power, ‘til I'm passin' on
Uh, six feet to the dead beats
Six feet to those that don’t understand me
Six feet to the lame dudes talking who scared to put a ring on it
Yeah, you know you hear me
Listen up this is therapy
There is no one ahead of me
A hundred bad chicks are backing me
The rest of y’all are just nominees

[Pre-Hook]
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me
If I can do it you can get it with me
Guacamole, come and get it with me
Point ‘em out, every penny, penny
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me
If I can do it you can get it with me
Guacamole, come and get it with me
Point ‘em out, every penny, penny

[Hook]
Now what’s a milli to a billion?
Forget a billi keep it trillion
We looking pretty in the building
Looking like a trillion
Feeling like a zillion
Now what’s a milli to a billion?
Forget a billi keep it trillion
We looking pretty in the building
Looking like a trillion
Feeling like a zillion

[Verse 2]
This is when I kill it, when I flip it
When I get it on
Money got us fickle think I want to spend it all
Fuck them with the silvers and golds
I’m getting commas and O’s like cheerios needs to get a song
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me?
From December to the motherfucking Igguary
Body bags putting covers in the cemetery
New Classic just the preliminary
This a rap bitch obituary
Pop queen, many weeks on the chart it’s scary
Got my squad no time for a little fairy
Raw shit, salmonella, gotta fuckin' bury
Legendary, kept it hustling, go for nothing, it was temporary
Seen it all before it happened I’m a visionary
Now the game, that’s mine, it’s necessary

[Pre-Hook]
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me
If I can do it you can get it with me
Guacamole, come and get it with me
Point ‘em out, every penny, penny
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me
If I can do it you can get it with me
Guacamole, come and get it with me
Point ‘em out, every penny, penny

[Hook]
Now what’s a milli to a billion?
Forget a billi keep it trillion
We looking pretty in the building
Looking like a trillion
Feeling like a zillion
Now what’s a milli to a billion?
Forget a billi keep it trillion
We looking pretty in the building
Looking like a trillion
Feeling like a zillion
Feeling like a zillion

[Refrain]
Heading for a zillion
Thumbing through a billion
Gotta keep it trillion
What is a million?
Heading for a zillion
Thumbing through a billion
Gotta keep it trillion
What is a million?
What is a million?

[Outro]
Listen up
This is when I kill it, when I flip it
When I get it on
Money got us fickle think I want to spend it all
Fuck them with the silvers and golds
I’m getting commas and O’s like cheerios needs to get a song
Gotta stack, stack, stack, stack bread
Getting commas and O’s O-O-O-O-O
Legendary
