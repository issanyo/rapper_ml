Motherfuckers calling my phone
1-800-Bone
Boy, ain't you know?
I can back it up like a tonka truck
So call my phone phone
1-800-Bone
Say you got that gun?
That AK-47
Bang! bang! bang!

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Iggy got that secret service this that presidential shit
Get the busy tone when ya call my phone and my voicemail full of messages
Say you got that AK-47 well let me see you shoot it
Eat it up, beat it up boy don't bruise it
Put ya hands on it don't slip don't lose it
Bad bitches in my chat room, my chat room be poppin
Turn that chat room to a freak show when them bad bitches get topless
Put it on ustream for the whole world so the whole world can see it
Got that hotline, and it's about time for me to swap it out, I gotta re-up
They saying, "Iggy, oh, Iggy," they wanna play with that kitty
They calling, blowing my phone up, wishing they could kick it with me
The way I'm stunting I'm hurting felines, they wondering what I'm getting
A hustler charging all of you customers by the minute

[Hook: Iggy Azalea]

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I double G Y, Iggy
Who fuck with I? Not many
Well know like them four turtles
Shredder, Bebop, and Rocksteady
That late night call be the beddy-bye
Now tell me, who the fuck are you sleeping on?
Round trip flight where the fuck I want
Doing everything you bitches don't
Private parties on roof tops
Exclusive shit when I shoe shop
Other hoes just crew hop, while I'm pulling up in the new drop
1-800-Bone thug
That freak shit I put you on some
You could try all night but I won't come
(you could try all night but I won't come)
You better make sure you ready
These killer instincts is deadly
They calling two at a time, got that 3 way on my telly
My hotline always ringing, I got them specials and deals
You know my sex is a weapon, they lining up to get killed

[Hook: Iggy Azalea]

Bridge:

Let me go stupid
Go ape shit
Go dumb
Go insane
In the membrane
That straight jacket shit
I'm a crazy bitch
