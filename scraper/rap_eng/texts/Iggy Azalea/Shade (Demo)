[Full lyrics available upon release of the song]

[Hook]
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade

[Verse 1]
Plastic bitches everywhere, man
All these bitches on the table
I put some work in and it came out perfect
You just mad 'cause it couldn't save you!
[?]
Throw a little shade, I'ma blast that
Throw a little shade, I'ma blast that

[Hook]
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade

[Verse 2]
[?]
You want a girl with a fat ass!
I sit it on his head like a halo
I sit it on his head like a halo
I sit it on his head like a halo
I sit it on his head like a halo!
Tell me that it tastes like an angel

[Hook]
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade, shade
