[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
Can we love until there's nothing left and we're collecting dust?
Use the hell out of our golden souls until we're flecks of rust

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
A love so deep, nothing else like it
Scars go deep, but they can't find it
Flame so bright, make the daylight look dark
Cross my heart that I'd die for ya
Cross my heart that I'll always keep ya
Cross my heart like a bittersweet tattoo
And we go...

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Sit me on your throne
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
Let it intertwine your hand in mine and fill the empty space
All the demons cry, 'cause you and I found love in a broken place

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
A love so deep, nothing else like it
Scars go deep, but they can't find it
Flame so bright, make the daylight look dark
Cross my heart that I'd die for ya
Cross my heart that I'll always keep ya
Cross my heart like a bittersweet tattoo
And we go...

[Chorus: Demi Lovato & (Iggy Azalea)]
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Sit me on your throne
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Iggs
Gather 'round, now I'm back from my holiday
"Long live the Queen," what the people say
And that be me
I gotta king in my cavalry
Them other knights say goodnight, they get apathy
You'll never catch an Adam without Eve
You'll never catch a Blue without Steve
See, what I mean, you're my Caesar
Burn my chariot
You know Family Matters
What's Carl without Harriet?
Inseparable, like Mary Kate and Ashley
Incredible, I'm ready if you ask me to ride on them
"Them" meaning "chicks", ya feel me?
I break 'em down, it's a sport, I should win an ESPY
Royalty another level, boy, your throne shine
Legendary love
The nation needs a paradigm
Call all the king's horses and all the kinsmen
We rule until the end (kingdom come)

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
And we go oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Sit me on your throne, yeah

[Outro: Demi Lovato]
You're my kingdom come
Sit me on your throne, yeah
You're my kingdom come
Sit me on your throne
