[Hook: Sukhwinder Singh & Iggy Azalea]
I give it all for the dream (Ha-Ha)
I give it all for the dream (Champion)
I give it all for the dream (Bring it)
Khushi aayi aayi aayi aayi aayi aa (Rab-raka)
Khushi aayi aayi aayi aayi aayi aa (Rab-raka)
Meeti aayi aayi aayi aayi aayi aa (Rab-raka)
(Jeetay raho jeetay jeetay jeetay jeetay)
I give it all for the dream

[Verse 1]
I give it all for the dream
Cause the goal ain't as far as it seems
I got this million dollar arm
Throwing everything I got into this million dollar dream
Into this million dollar dream
Into this, into this million dollar dream
Live and direct fresh out the jet
My bet is y'all ain't seen nothing like this yet
Confident walk, it's success when I step
You'll probably never see this again, don't hold your breath

[Verse 2]
Spinning bowls good enough to bring the winnings home
Now the top of the mound is what we sitting on
Balling like we supposed to
The level that we sitting in now ain't nobody close to
Everything that mean something is what we came for
I'm going home with it all, that's how the game go
I'm on the way to the top, I know the way to go
We just want the world while it's spinning
That's what we playing for
Nothing new here so what I gotta do here?
I like it, I love it, I just might bring the whole crew here
Stay for two years and get to acting like I grew here
Next thing you know, you look up, I be done blew here
Everything that mean something is what we came for
I'm going home with it all, that's how the game go
I'm on the way to the top, I know the way to go
We just want the world while it's spinning
That's what we playing for

Meeti aayi aayi aayi aayi aayi aa (Rab-raka)
