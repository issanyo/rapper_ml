[Prod. by Wine-O:]

Clothes tight as hell, girl might as well
Ain't no kiss and tell, if that ain't for sale
I told the girl to go home 'cos she ain't fine as you
I hit the bar with a G, let's have a drink or two (oww!)
Her body is looking good, but she is out of sight
Can't take you to my hood, 'cos I'm gonna have a fight
My eyes burning through that it ain't polite
That's 'cos I can't blink, can't get you out of my sight

[Hook:]
Yeah (woohoo)
She dancing in them red bottoms (woohoo)
(Repeat)

...
It ain't trickin if you gotta go and spend that cash (x2)

[Iggy Azalea:]
It's hot, hot in this club
I'm thirsty
Baby show me love
I'm sweating, I'm sweating
Need a drink so I can get in front of you
And take it low, make everybody wish they was you
Spend a couple dollars on me
...
Like them pink, yellow, blue
Keep them coming if you tryna kickin and conversate
They be gettin like T-Pain, buy me a drank
It ain't trickin if you gotta go and spend that cash (x2)
