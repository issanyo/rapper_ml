Verse 1:
Everything that glitters ain't gold, 'cept trappin'
I'm talkin' 'bout 'rappin
Yo, I'm talkin' 'bout the action
An I'm callin' up first
Hit the yo, hits happen
Two beans in the bucket
Fuck it
Aye, let's take it to the stage
Flip that bird. Equal shows on shows
Equal stacks on racks
Yo, I gotta gets paid
Get the rush like a dealer
Cook this flow ship it off no sleep
Every show sold out from the clubs to arenas
Flow dope so I might get subpoena, yo
B Section:
Deal for the 8th, 21 for the key
Every flow be a quarter, you promoters know me
Whip work, whip it hard, gold bricks O.Z
Yeah
I'm talkin' 'bout my shows
Pay money in my hand, quicktime

Chrous:
(repeat) QuickTime

Verse 2:
Ain't enough time, in a day so I ship every coke line
Take bong, and a brick that's one rhyme
Make stacks, make it flip facing life time
Make it flip like Gabby Douglas
You know what that mean?
Iggy gotta bring home the gold
Usain with my money better come in a bolt
White girl mean dope
I swear she go
They say I'm dope
B Section:
Deal for the 8th, 21 for the key
Every flow be a quarter, you promoters know me
Whip work, whip it hard, gold bricks, O.Z
Yeah I'm talkin bout my shows
Pay money in my hand, quicktime

Chorus:
(repeat) QuickTime

B Section:
Time time to get this cash, we blowing money fast
Mijo hit my boost, He just trying to get some ass
If it ain't 'bout money fuck it
These Azaleans, they love it
So I gotta drop Trap Gold, bet all the trunks they sub it

Chorus:
(repeat) Quicktime
