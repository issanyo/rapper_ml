[Chorus: T.I]
All we really know a kid pimpin', all we do is get fly
VVS shine like the sun outside
Somebody tryna tell you Hustle Gang ain't gettin' to the money
Tell that nigga "You a mothafuckin' lie"
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you thought? Fuck you thought?
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you talm 'bout? Fuck you talm 'bout?
Nigga hell you sayin'?

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
I make rainy days, it's a drought for you
Y'all ain't crusin' my altitude
I'm a boss bitch, I let you spread the rumors
Yea you talkin' shit but not an ounce true
Million dollar misfit, my money pilin'
All over the lettuce like Thousand Island
My dough runnin' like a broken faucet
I'm the landlord, you in the housing projects
In the drive-thru, makin' bank deposits
Crazy money, insane asylum
Boss Chase, got her taxes filed
And then I blow the rest while I’m at Saks shopping
Amsterdam, Germany and Holland
Changing your currency to dollars
It's Iggy bitch, and this boss shit
Where the pounds at?
No trending topic

[Chorus: T.I]
All we really know a kid pimpin', all we do is get fly
VVS shine like the sun outside
Somebody tryna tell you Hustle Gang ain't gettin' to the money
Tell that nigga "You a mothafuckin' lie"
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you thought? Fuck you thought?
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you talm 'bout? Fuck you talm 'bout?
Nigga hell you sayin'?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
All I talk is money, ye ain't got it, ain't nothin'
I'm on the grind, shinin' like an elevator button
Wanna talk? Nigga lissen, call me [?]
You got a bad bitch? I gotta have that buddy
Bein' broke? Nigga please, you can have that, buddy
This nigga say he doin' numbers, where yo math at buddy?
I'm in a mothafuckin' socket, can't unplug it
Think I'm mothafuckin' lyin', try and take somethin' from me
Bitch I'm plugged to the max, pay a dub for a pack
Take it back to the trap, make it jump right back
Break it down into O's, sell quarters of those
If I ain't got it on me, it's some more at the store
I know a thousand mothafuckin' niggas in the city
Say T.I.P. 'bout you, shawty anybody get it
So 'fore you get robbed, get trapped by 80
Just know Hustle Gang thug a hella lot

[Chorus: T.I]
All we really know a kid pimpin', all we do is get fly
VVS shine like the sun outside
Somebody tryna tell you Hustle Gang ain't gettin' to the money
Tell that nigga "You a mothafuckin' lie"
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you thought? Fuck you thought?
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you talm 'bout? Fuck you talm 'bout?
Nigga hell you sayin'?

[Verse 3: Young Dro]
We got them niggas over there dead
Coupe Benz, no roof, I'm without head
New shoes, you ain't got this pair yet
Your broad late, kinda on cause I had that
She in the driveway, tryna fix her hair back
I had a dick marathon and she ran that
Lapped that, after that, when her care better
Killed her with the pole, then let her hang half mast
Fuck them, I'm still hoppin' out of foreign cars
I'm a born star and I'm a porn star
I catch you slippin' with triggers and really hit a nigga
By myself, I ain't gotta go get a nigga
Trap Biggie, on track verbally killin' niggas
Sick flow, might need Penicillin, nigga
I do the impossible like I oughta do
And y'all pussy niggas smaller than a molecule
Out!

[Verse 4: Travi$ Scott]
I left my passport overseas
Where it get dark after 3
Never leave the house 'less I'm awfully flee
Always leave the show with somethin' soft to squeeze
Take a little dab of this, a little drag of this
Then she reached down my pants, grabbed my shaggy dick
Left that mothafucka's home covered in my kids
She bossy, get this grip, straight flossin'
Smoke the piece with little coffee
Fresh as hell, no coffin'
I let her talk the shit
Leave the crib, can't walk for shit shit
Buck the dome, Milwaukee shit
Mind so big, gettin' lost and shit
Bossin', hit the club they heed caution
Drunk as hell feelin' nauseous
High as hell, hittin' comets
I’m raunchy, your niggas rock Givenchy
I ain't gotta say it, I ain't gotta wear it
I ain't gotta pay it cause you know it don't cost me

[Chorus: T.I]
All we really know a kid pimpin', all we do is get fly
VVS shine like the sun outside
Somebody tryna tell you Hustle Gang ain't gettin' to the money
Tell that nigga "You a mothafuckin' lie"
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you thought? Fuck you thought?
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you talm 'bout? Fuck you talm 'bout?
Nigga hell you sayin'?
