Honestly right in this moment that's so unimportant
Your bitch is bad you should fuck like i'm in trouble for it
Know this
I just be wanting to misbehave
There's no rest
But boy we still don't have no time to waste
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
We be fighting all day babe
What are you gon' do to make it better?
Be a grown man
You say that you run it come make me believe it
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Like you mean it, cause I need it babe
