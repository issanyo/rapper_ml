[Verse 1]
They try to mold me, make me
Me no social experiment
Girl y'all can't take me
Might get dem girls 'cause them girls lazy
But that's not acceptable from the woman who raised me
See, I wake up early and go to sleep late as fuck
That's why if I wanted, bitch, I could go get the Bentley truck
Wait I'ma go get it then, don't like being told no
I prove 'em wrong
There's no such thing as no when you're on your own
(On your own, on your own)
Lately, I've been on some other shit
I swear I'll never work no 9 to 5 like you, bitch, no offense
I'm done with those phases of tryna fit in
I'm done with those places you tryna get in
I'm done giving attention to those who don't deserve it
It wasn't worth it, I'm moving with a purpose

[Chorus]
Way up like so high, too high
Don't think that this is so fair
Y'all just tryna be the housewives of those guys
But I don't wanna go there
I'm just tryna live my life, look nice
Take some pics and let you hate on it
Hate on it, I let you hate on it
Yeah yeah, I let you hate on it

[Verse 2]
I just got another bag, boy count it up
Made the front of another mag, go and mount it up
And you just pulled up in a jag, that's the funny thing
You hop out selling flat tummy teas, you [?]
Back it up, I approach with such a lavish swag
You've got a whole lot to say with such a average bag
Get the fuck out my face with your average ass
Y'all just a bunch of grown-ups with some average cash
This shit is easy, mami
Drop a 516 for some easy money
Batman the whip can't see me, mami
I thought I had some competition, don't tease me, honey

[Chorus]
Way up like so high, too high
Don't think that this is so fair
Y'all just tryna be the housewives of those guys
But I don't wanna go there
I'm just tryna live my life, look nice
Take some pics and let you hate on it
Hate on it, I let you hate on it
Yeah yeah, I let you hate on it

[Verse 3]
I just got my second wind, I feel like coming back
I left the whole wide open for your running back
And you ain't even take the chance, you had to run it back
And linebackers back and she ain't havin' none of that
None of that, none of that
I just got my second wind
Yeah, none of that
