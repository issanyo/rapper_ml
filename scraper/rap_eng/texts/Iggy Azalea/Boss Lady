[Hook]
I tell a bitch I'm bossing
So make ya offer, if it's money we're talking
Man step in my office
Promoters calling me often
From the Bay out to Boston
And overseas they know what it's costing
Bitch I'm bossing!

[Verse 1]
I make rainy days, it's a drought for you
Y'all ain't crusin' my altitude
I'm a boss bitch, I let you spread the rumors
Yeah you talking shit, but not an ounce is true
Million dollar misfit, my money pilin'
All over the lettuce like Thousand Island
My dough running like a broken faucet
I'm the landlord, you in the housing projects
In the drive-thru, makin' bank deposits
Crazy money, insane asylum
Boss Chase, got her taxes filed
And then I blow the rest while Iâ€™m at Saks shopping
Amsterdam, Germany and Holland
Changing your currency to dollars
It's Iggy bitch, and this boss shit
Where the pounds at?
