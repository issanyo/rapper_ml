[Iggy Azalea:]
Are you out there? Bring it over here
If so where, hands in the air
Let's start a new life, take on the world
Queen on the throne, listen to this song
If you out there, step into my zone
Show me how you rock, gimme what you got
Make me your one

[Nash Yamin:]
Because I love her and need her
Like Earth needs the Sun
I need the one I love
To keep my hope bright
My head right
My heart fighting on
Until I am back in her arms

Because I love her and need her
Like summer needs rain
To grow and sustain each day
I hear her singing
And bringing strength to my soul
Until I am back in her arms

Miles apart, yet still my heart can hear her melody
I'm more than sure I can't endure
Without her love for me

Because I love her and need her
Like I need to breathe
Did Adam need Eve like this?

Now I see clearly
I nearly gave up all I had
So whatever our differences were
I'll bid them goodbye
I'll give love a try
And all because I love her
Oh yeah

[Iggy Azalea:]
Searchin' for a dude that can call me wifey
Ready for the ring, just maybe I might be
Never been a smut, I don't care who like me
I can count on one hand all the dudes that's piped me
Takin kinda long, time is moving on
Been feeling kinda strong, love is on the phone
Ya saying that I'm here, if only you could hear
My heart yellin' out, I wanted to compare
I know what I deserve, I demand the bestest
That's why all my past dudes' names is ex's
Keep that thing in your pants I don't need your sex's
Better come correct when you step to a princess

[Nash Yamin:]
Because I love her and need her
Like I need to breathe
Did Adam need Eve like this?

Now I see clearly
I nearly gave up all I had
So whatever our differences were
I'll bid them goodbye
I'll give love a try
And all because I love her
Oh
