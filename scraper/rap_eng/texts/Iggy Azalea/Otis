[Intro: Otis Redding]
It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't be regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
(Sounds so soulful, don’t you agree?)
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her

[Iggy Azalea]
Uh, I invented pussy, got a sign over mine that says "not for rookies"
Fresh off a private flight, talking with pilots
Goddess of the rap game, Iggy the new Isis
Crisis, always double threat, one of one
You ain't met a bitch like me yet
Me and Angel never let these dusty rappers
Like fuck what you got going in advance don't match our nail budgets

[Angel Haze]
Damn Iggy and Haze, where the hell you been?
Chillin’ out in Italy, India on the elephant
Stuntin’ on these bitches who strugglin’ to be relevant
Diplo bitches, we never taking our medicine
Brand new coupe, riding out with a veteran
In a bad bitch, who swear that


She ain't eleven yet
I'm close to my prime, near lyrical excellence
Bitches getting cocky like they don't know who they up against

[Iggy Azalea]
Uh, I can't smash make em realize that you can't spell Aussie without ass
They ain't about the cash and now past
You love 'em, I can have 'em like the bed of an eyelash
I ask, have you in your short-legged life
Ever walked in the hills with heels
At this height
Yikes! Mama I guess not
You could never be me little lady, so just stop

[Angel Haze]
I made a million dollars in a year, it was nothing
You made half that, and you did it while you fucking
Versace everything, like I'm Donatella's cousin
And now I ain't pay for nothing they just ship it by the dozen
All my bitches know I'm all about the Benji's
All about a hundred like the legs of a centipede
Stuntin’ ain’t a habit, stuntin’s a consistency
If they know I can kill ‘em then why the fuck they be tempting me?

[Iggy Azalea]
Uh, lion haired killer
Thick hip Agent Provocateur filler
(Mmmm, mmmm, mmm) er, I'm getting iller
New watch on my wrist is such a chiller
Steps come fast I ain't got a minute
You bitches is walking backwards, MJ: Thriller
New Classic coming, I'm no beginner
Got a date with an Angel, lean on you bitches' dinner

[Angel Haze]
Make you see the future, lil' nigga we the fuckin' best
Got a fire blow like a dragon in my fuckin' chest
Iggy fuckin' eat 'em, eat 'em til' there's nothing left
Now I'm fuckin' finished so I'll beat you till you're fuckin' deaf
Damn, it's 'bout to need a fuckin' witness
So all you ADD hoes got to pay attention (repeat x2)
About to get an ass whooping

[Outro: Otis Redding]
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her (repeat)

[Angel Haze]
Thank you
Fuck, amazing
