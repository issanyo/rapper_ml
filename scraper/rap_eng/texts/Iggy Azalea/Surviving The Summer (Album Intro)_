You promised me a fake plastic love
Told me to be organic, then laughed when I started to wither
Sipped on synthetic happiness pool side at the standard and didn't call me back
Summer you ain't shit

I tried to be a mother
Warm but tough like noon concrete
I tried to be a brush
Painting you in better light
I tried to be a wave; when we fight rising and retreating
I tried to stop the blue plumes
Billowing doubt from my texts
Inevitable conclusion;
He's leaving me for summer

I'm scared of crashing a plane on the runway
I worry about people's negative energies
I'm anxious about barbershop talk and internet memes
I fear loving me has become inconvenient
What if summer arrives - and I'm still waiting in line for happiness?
