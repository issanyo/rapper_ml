[Verse 1]
I remember like 10 years ago
I wanted my name up in bold
I wanted my name up in lights
I wanted to rock every show
I used to take pics in the mirror
I had to get ready for Vogue
And now I'm way bigger, way bigger, way bigger
Than I ever could've dreamed before
They pray for the down on my luck
But I still don't give a fuck
We live in a world full of judgement
And they love to judge us
I think they love to discuss me
'Cause their life is disgusting
I just jumped off a yacht in Mexico
You cannot tell me nothing, na-nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm good, I'm good, I'm glad
To be right where I'm at
And you mad, you mad, you mad
But I'm good

[Chorus]
So you can say what you want to, yeah
But that doesn't phase what I'm gon' do, yeah
Is that why you stuck in a bad mood? Yeah
'Cause I'm good, I'm good, I'm good

[Verse 2]
Top floor, bring the white gold
Eating dinner looking at the view
So high, see all of you
Each and everyone who wanna see me lose
You looking at me, but I'm looking through you
You tweeting crazy to me, what's it to you?
Fall in line, this is danger for who?
Get off my ass, you are not a poodle
I'm just out here fucking living
Cut 'em off, they're forbidden
Trade the sides, they was tripping
They like ''Oh, Iggy, I was kidding!''
I go to sleep and y'all forgotten
Sorry boo, you're not forgiven
Bring me breakfast while I'm swimming
I'm just out here fucking living

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm good, I'm good, I'm glad
To be right where I am at
And you mad, you mad, you mad
But I'm good

[Chorus]
So you can say what you want to, yeah
But that doesn't phase what I'm gon' do, yeah
Is that why you stuck in a bad mood? Yeah
'Cause I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
