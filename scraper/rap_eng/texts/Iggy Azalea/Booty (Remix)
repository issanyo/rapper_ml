[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & Iggy Azalea]
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Ooh)
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (It’s Iggy Iggs)
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Go to work)
Big, big booty, what you? (Ow! Ain’t that a freak)
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Ain’t that a freak)

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Have you seen her on the dance floor?
She got the boom, shake the room
That’s the lightning and the thunder
You wanna meet her, you wanna touch her
See the light in her eyes, and it starts to make you wonder (Ain't that a freak)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man, bring him to the dance floor
Go on let them jeans touch you while you're dancing
(Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty)
It’s his birthday, give him what he ask for
(Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty)
Let me show you how to do it

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Work)
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Shake that)
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Go to work)
Big, big booty, what you? (Ain't that a freak) Huh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
The way she moves, I know you want her
She light the fire, get you right
That’s the lightning and the thunder
You wanna meet her, you gotta touch her
Hold on tight for the ride
'Cause you know you gonna love her

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man, bring him to the dance floor
Go on let them jeans touch you while you're dancing
It’s his birthday, give him what he ask for
Let me show you how to do it

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Work)
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Shake that)
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Go to work)
Big, big booty, what you? (Ain't that a freak) Huh

[Verse 3: Iggy Azaela]
They begging me to drop down on it but right now Iggy on the top
The last time the world seen a booty this good, it was on Jenny from the block
I got 'em going crazy lately
But baby knowin' that only make me
Wanna tell all of my ladies to get up on the floor and just shake it, shake it (Ain't that a freak)
Y'all know what I've been on, y'all know that I've been on
I'm queen big booty, Iggy, now find me a throne to sit on
Girls with the cheeks, put 'em hands in the air
Then pop that, pop that, let 'em know that you there
See, everybody wanna get a taste
You know that we've got enough to share
But fact we girls with the big fat booty too fancy to ever play fair

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez & Iggy Azaela]
Mesmerized by the size of it (Oh-oh-oh, uh-huh)
You can fight it if you like take your time (Oh-oh-oh)
I can guarantee you’ll have the time of your life (That's right)
Throw up your hands if you love a big booty

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Iggy Azaela]
Big big big big big big booty, what you
Big big big big big big booty, what you
Big big big big big big...
Let me show you how to do it
Work
Shake that
Go to work (Ow!)
Go to work (Ain't that a freak) Huh

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Shake that)
