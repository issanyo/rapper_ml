[Iggy Azalea:]
Step it up to the plate, take your bestest shot
Pad it up, tie around, chain it up
Gotta keep this lock
Put it down, hear me now
See the flag, represent that A-U-S-T-R-A-L-I-A
By way, shorty so L.A
Don't matter what you say
I don't care you pay
Get it on these heads I'm so too-pay
Chillin' up in Paris yo, that ish cray
In a maybac, no it ain't rosé
Oh Im off Rosé
Spit a semi AK
Bodies all decay in the place, thick waist, don't hate
Not another chick in my race
DJ not a scratch on my face

[Stix:]
Yo, check-check it king me
This our time I'm on her chess no pawn
Peezy tell them Stix he's the best no con
I'll be here til the end Shoa Khan
Now I'm on, long, gone
You ain't Diggy dad, no you can't Run
Baby stare, to my home
Legs they spread like grey poupon

[Hook:]
Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy
Launch your assault now, take it easy
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
One word and it's over

[Stix & (Iggy):]
Yo, Iggy, Stix, peep that flow
Bury all these rappers that's our M.O
(Bury all these rappers that's our M.O)
Iggy get to rapping six feet they go
Yo, knock it out like Kirby
New chinchilla, jacket mimicking a Furby ?
Mixin' up these rhymes, taste that McFlurry
Stix kill mics, Conrad Murray

[Iggy Azalea:]
Y'all better hurry, call no bluffs
Shorty hot-dog, yall ketchup
Never gonna fall, chain so winter
Spring when I drop a summer, wasssup
Uh, I'm the queen of this club
Uh, spit raw thats rare
Uh, I'm a call it little ras-cal
He man woman hater

[Stix:]
Do it to the death, rappers get in line
This season's in style, it was stitched and design
X-factor here, drew it up in the mind
Hater's hate us, Merlot they whine
Twilight, New Moon I shine
Eclipse what I drive
Breaking dawn when I'm gone
Where wolves are and vamps you find
All, this means everybody I'm cold
