[Intro: Iggy Azalea]
It's Iggy Iggs!

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Kick in the door, wavin' the four fizzy
They already know they can't fuck with Iggy
True's cost more than the rent do, you know that
All black on when I come through, it's Kodak
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Is Iggy the ziggy-iggy the baddest of 'em all?
Why you come through, shut down the mall?
All that ass deserve an applause

[Pre-Interlude: Anitta & (Iggy Azalea)]
Change the game (Change it up, change it up now)
Switchin' up the game (Switch it up, switch it up now)
There I go again (Here we go, here we go)
Play your role, play you ro-o-ole
Fantasy (Fantasy)
Turns reality (Turn reality)
Right in front of me (Right in front of me)
I can have it anyway I want

[Interlude: Iggy Azalea]
This is 'bout that time, this is, this is, 'bout that switch!
This is 'bout that time you recognise that I'm that bitch!
This is all that sauce, this is, this is all that switch!
This is all that sauce your momma said you couldn't Uh!

[Post-Interlude: Iggy Azalea]
This is 'bout that time
This is 'bout that time Switch!
This is 'bout that time
This is, this 'bout that time Switch!

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Me and my boo on a worldwide hustle
You know what it is when I flex that muscle
I don't even know what a real one do
Talk that talk, I can back it up too
Got yo dessert, call me the waiter
I'm flirtin', you get it later
You could get it from the inside out
No hands, you could put it in your mouth

[Pre-Interlude: Anitta & (Iggy Azalea)]
Change the game (Change it up, change it up now)
Switchin' up the game (Switch it up, switch it up now)
There I go again (Here we go, here we go)
Play your role, play you ro-o-ole
Fantasy (Fantasy)
Turns reality (Turn reality)
Right in front of me (Right in front of me)
I can have it anyway I want

[Interlude: Iggy Azalea]
This is 'bout that time, this is, this is, 'bout that switch!
This is 'bout that time you recognise that I'm that bitch!
This is all that sauce, this is, this is all that switch!
This is all that sauce your momma said you couldn't Uh!

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
This is 'bout that time
This is 'bout that time Switch!
This is 'bout that time
This is, this 'bout that time Switch!
And I'm still a ma'fuckin' rockstar
Popstar but I roll with the mobsters
Yacht club on the shore eating lobster
While I'm stunting in Geneva with my top off
This is 'bout that time
This is 'bout that time Switch!

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch!
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that switch!
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch!
Red light, yellow light, green light (Switch it up on 'em)
This is about the time you recognize I'm that
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't
Red light, yellow light, green light (Switch it up on 'em)

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
This is 'bout that time
This is 'bout that time Switch!
This is 'bout that time
This is, this 'bout that time Switch!
And I'm still a ma'fuckin' rockstar
Popstar but I roll with the mobsters
Yacht club on the shore eating lobster
While I'm stunting in Geneva with my top off
This is 'bout that time
This is 'bout that time Switch!
