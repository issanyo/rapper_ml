[Intro: BODAK]
(Get it)

[Verse 1: BODAK]
Open up the safe, bitches got a lot to say
Everybody stare at me, staring them away
They want pussy and some cash, dollars every day
Money coming from the pipes, it’s a big payday
I’m just telling something right in the front of him
Cause he know that I’ma problem that’s why everybody scream
I got Lambo truck on parking, he got sick and fake Supreme
Issa trouble just for him, cause I’m bout to take a swim
Don’t need going to the gym
Put the money for the plastic so I’m looking like a win
Hit the spot in dropping thin, he got dropped and he got seen
I ain’t guilty but I’ll drop you in the Mediterranean
In this worldwide
You ain’t championship, but the soccer really wild
He waving up to me, standing under triggers mine
Call up to me, he just said bye

[Hook: BODAK]
Ass, cash, cash, ass, bags, bad
Ass, cash, cash, ass, bags, bad
(Get it)

[Verse 2: Lil Eye]
Каждая звезда на мне трофей
Она сдирает с меня кожу, будто я Ворфаломей
Когда я одел браслет стало чуть похолодней
Они знают, кто тут главный, значит она будет моей
Лил Ай и Бодак
Сука, я не помню, как зовут тех идиоток
Пару сотен тысяч я снял сейчас со счета
В этой рэп игре открыты все ворота
Браслет мой сияет
Твоя девушка тебе изменяет
Сука, я не понимаю, что происходит
VVS на теле, мой член в нее входит

[Hook: BODAK]
Ass, cash, cash, ass, bags, bad
Ass, cash, cash, ass, bags, bad
(Get it)

[verse 3: BODAK]
Cash rules everything around me
Deep in the pussy, yeah I’m drowning
Looking like a Bounty, issa paradise
He calling up to you, so he just wanna slice
He begging me for fuck, I tell em pay me fucking milli bills
Truly I was ready to get billionaire deals
I said him you’re so fake, like Hannah Baker tape
He threw a shade for me, I leaked his own sextape
Open up the door, he just gotta roar
Put him in the drip, he got diamonds and pure gold
Like I was a person who was making part four
But every boy you meet, you was making this tho
Patek on the wrist i got wanted so in search
They just wanna cut my head, i just wanna Swatch
They don’t make me sad, I ain’t Overwatch
And every time you smashing sounds like you can’t get approached
Ain’t no research on me
Bitches outside, yeah they gotta put a tag on me
Waiting for my call, motherfucker want to tackle me
Peck on me, like I was a wrestler just to wreck on me
In this shit shining
Dressed in designer
Looking like fucker
And I made me flawless, drinking with Thanos
Artemiy Ten, make me some silence

[Hook: BODAK]
Ass, cash, cash, ass, bags, bad
Ass, cash, cash, ass, bags, bad
