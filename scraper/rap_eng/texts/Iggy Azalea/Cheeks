[Verse 1]
Coke bottle shape, European model face
The way I make it shake, making money I'll take some
Rude girl running like a race, got them gold metal legs and my mind second place
I wind it up for ya like a coo coo clock
Them flat backs hate and I said woo woo stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Bend it over to the front
Put your fingers on ya toes
If you got a fat back where you at let me know huh

[Chorus]
So fat it just sit up on my back
Got you begging me to sit it in ya lap

All them girls with the cheeks where you at?
All them girls with the cheeks where you at?
All them girls with the cheeks where you at?
Make em holler encore when it clap
All them girls with the cheeks where you at?

[Verse 2]
Put her out with it go and touch it but don't put your hands on it
If it's big enough watch me do a dance on it
Got you on a trance on it make bounce 50s hold the dance on it

It's talking like dealer iggy igg aka the Balmain jean filler
Wanna tell me bout it but they don't hear me though

[Pre-Chorus]
Now bend it over to the front
Got your fingers on your toes
If you got a fat back where you at lemme know huh

[Chorus]
So fat can't you sit up on my back
