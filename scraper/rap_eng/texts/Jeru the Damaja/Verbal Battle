Intro: Jeru The Damaja

In the time when hip hop was strong
The Supahuman Klik ruled the land
Bringin that futuristic hip hop, presently in time
The first lieutenant in arms of the Supahuman Klik
Was the all mighty, all powerful, Miz Marvel
I think she can describe it how she does better

{Miz Marvel}
Thought I disappeared now that the smoke has cleared
I come from times with inabitions, face to face with fears
While shootin stars wishing that I can shift my gears
So I raise my glass eye, I drink to that, say cheers
And let the fire water wash away the tears, burn like salt
On open wounds, thoughts consume all consetions
Give birth to these rhymes like an oral C-section
Uhh, positive connection throughout the galaxy
Time to switch to reality, make proper arrangements
For the souls of fatalities
It's the same for niggas that stuck with that slave mentality
Or these wack ass rappers, they got no originality
But my mentality, helps me travel around the galaxy
Time gets shorter, I'm on the water, run insanity
It seems like everyone was after me
Three's a nasty girl like Vanity
Make niggas wild, I smoke la, anything to keep my sanity
Ain't got no friends, everyone with me is family
If they standing next to me, nothing's what it seems to be
Sending energy, when I rhyme, but no time for idol questions
If freestyling is my bible, when I fall in hip hop sessions
Of the tribal blessings, lessons to be learned
Respect had to be earned and not given
On the fourth of them but not amongst the men that living
Guy collides, when selfish minds can't asked to be forgiven
Ain't no turning back the hands of time
When past spirits have risen

Black, black, black
Verbal, power, verbal, power

{Miz Marvel}
Power of the moon and the force of a sonic boom
Help me heel like battle wounds, to that shit I'm immune
We come thru like the first platoon, into smoke filled rooms
Into it seems like magic mushrooms, from the womb to the tomb
I got a meetin in the ladies room, I be back real soon
O-o-oh o-o-o-oh
And all pro, precise position, like a crossbow
To strike the deathblow, continue with a never ending flow
Friend or foe, gas heads go from C.E.O. to skid row
See the toxic green flow, it's poison waters overflow
Paint a mental picture, lyrical Michaelangelo
Words pierced with the sting of a scorpio
Beats mad bong, to collapse the Walls of Jericho
Overflow and explore, I hope you got your blunts rolled
Cuz this is the same, no matter which zip code
My minds pro, bitches is robbed
Suckin the diamonds out your ear lobe
I keep it tracked like a barcode of Illuminati
And fight these devils back with the Code of Hammurabi

{Miz Marvel}
I strike with magnum force, send you on a collision course
With no remorse, I tap the source and knock you off ya high horse
While beats and rhymes have intercourse to reproduce their first born
Never sworn not to make the same mistakes as there parents
Written on there face, time worn sharpen then a poison desert storm
Step on first month Capricorn, quiet storm
Jeans and boots my everyday uniform
Elegants ruffness and inocence, if ever given a form
Hell have a fury like a women's scorn
My niggas strife to perform, I struggle to break the norm
Give me any platform and I perform lyrical quiet storms
I make it hot, you keep it luke warm
From hotels to college dorms, keep these niggas souls torned

{More scratching}

Lot of other people, other groups aware of these consciousness
Virtually impossible to defend against (repeated over and over)
