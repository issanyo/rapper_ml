[Verse 1: Guru]
I said people people, come on and check it out now
You see the mic in my hand now watch me wreck it now
What is a party if the crew ain't there?
(What's your name, kid?)
Call me Guru that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back
Slander the name and withhold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many, they go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year suckers are going nowhere
'Cause my street style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
MCs that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aiming on, raining on those bitch ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggas better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up 'cause I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfully mine
Yeah me and the crew think it's about that time
But on the DL you know that Gang Starr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My Nautica, asking for a hook-up
Well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business kid, this ain't no free for all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate, before I get irate
And I'll kick your can from here to Japan
With force you can't withstand 'cause I'm the motherfucking man

[Bridge: Guru]
Yo right now I got my man Lil Dap from the Group Home
Yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man

[Verse 2: Lil Dap]
So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, motherfucker just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
Why punks get killed at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip, Lil Dap remains sick
Yes the Group Home is thick so all you punks hear this
Every time you riff the more fame that we get
Motherfuckers act hard, thinking that they are God
Niggas just don't understand, let me be my own man
Did everything on my own, 'cause every place wasn't home
Anywhere that I rest, had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine, but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind, brothers doing mad time
Rhymes are organized like crime as they're ripped in a line
Brothers just don't know how shit got to go
'Cause I was told to never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto, dead souls I greet
See my man give him pound, then I walk with a frown
Another minute, another brother's gunned down
Shit is getting too close, that's why the Group Home is thick
So every time you riff, the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one across the street
Watch the one right next, because he's easy to flex
Took heed to what he said, yeah that deep ass nigga
While brothers hang around, trying to get down
Niggas just don't understand, I'm the motherfucking man

[Bridge: Guru]
And also on the set from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
We got my man Jeru the Damaja
Yo tell them why you're the man

[Verse 3: Jeru the Damaja]
I'll tap your jaw, you probably heard it before
Step to the bedlamite, I'll prove my word is law
Drugstore worth more, dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef, a chief ambassador
Niggas get mad 'cause they can't score
Like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot, don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
Like I said before I tap jaws, snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars, vic a style you said was yours
Money grip wanna flip but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizing my tools in '92
MCs step up in mobs to defeat us when
We rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson
Lots of friends, lots of fun, lots of beers
Got the skills, greeno so I always get cheers
Troop on like a trooper no tears for fears
I'ma get mines 'cause the crew'll get theirs
Cut you up like Edward Scissorhands
You know the program I'm the motherfucking man
