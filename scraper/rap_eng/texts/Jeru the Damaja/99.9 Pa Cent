[Verse 1: Jeru the Damaja]
You wanna front, what? Jump up and get bucked
The original, Dirty Rotten's fucking shit up
Empty your clip of lyrics in your chest and gut
All punks play the floor, it's raw and hardcore
Hotter than a meteor, scorching egos
Fake hoes, gangsters and super heroes
Cops pull me over like you under arrest
Some niggas I know act like bitches without breast
Dick riders, I hope you got your latex
Cause flesh gets burnt up during the process
DRS echoes through your projects
Met Billie Jean, had safe sex
Some MCs get caught up in the vortex
Mixing crack with cess, so they sold for fat checks
Listen to the words I manifest, the moment of truth have cats stressed
Every time you in the East they snatch the chain off your chest
Acting like you want some, but want none
Quick to make your finger like a gun, but faggots never bust none

[Hook]
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick

[Verse 2: Jeru the Damaja]
Amateuristic martial arts is the number one cause of injury
Biters try to emulate my alchemy, get poisoned by the chemistry
99.9 percent of these niggas suck dick in the industry
Swords in my back, all for the benjies
I'm screaming off key, another body? No I'm back in 3D
Plus I can take the weight, I make the Earth rotate
Dick riders supply the gas, watch niggas head inflate
Wanting respect, but suspect hit the deck
This ain't just talk, Brooklyn East New York's on the set
Friendship vs. B.I. I keep my thoughts
Laser sharp jagged edges bust your third eye
Vessel of the most high, bullshit, they demand you supply
But don't get caught, the same nigga'll testify
Switch like a bitch
You not from East New York, you's a motherfucking snitch

[Hook]
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick

[Verse 3: Jeru the Damaja]
Hip Hop Jim Kelly, leave the mic dead and smelly
Freak shows, flows and hoes back at the telly
Not your average nigga, gets more nasty than Dirk Diggler
I'm back like the night, swooping down on The Riddler
Fake thugs talk tough but ease off the trigger
So shook you shiver, poison verbs like alcohol destroy your liver
Make it volcanic hot, niggas got problems like Sir Smoke-a-Lot
Cannibals biting my dick, I need a tetanus shot
I'm the original, in cause your forgot
When it comes to war I get raw
Add another mic to the ones I rip, shooting the gift
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

[Hook]
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick

Word up, peace I'm out
The original Dirty Rotten Scoundrel
