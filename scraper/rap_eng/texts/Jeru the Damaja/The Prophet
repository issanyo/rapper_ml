[Intro]
"Ayo Prophet, yo Phophet, we need your help
[?] on fighting for the TVs and the radio
Everywhere you look, it's Envy, Hatred, Greed, Jealousy
You can't move, the city is suffocating
You have to help us, help us, please"

[Verse 1]
Shorty said she need a solder, so I'm back no doubt
Last time I had to scrap with Ignorance, he damn near took me out
See I can't do it myself so I allow myself with Patience
Cat that I rolled with in the past turn out to be double agents
Thought I killed this dude before, he had a million clones of Hatred
And he keep trying to stop me like the guys in The Matrix
I'm fighting for my life when I realize that I'm fucked
In the mist of the firefight, my weapon jams up
I don't move as quick as I used to, so I almost get stuck
And when I tried to escape, I catch a slug in my gut
Despair laughing at me talking 'bout "we got you, nigga"
There's an explosion, I'm scooped up by a mysterious figure
We flew off in a helicopter
Not a ghetto bird, but a military black hawk chopper
I wonder who would help me, it ain't make no sense
It wasn't Pride, 'cause he has a goal, he start working with Arrogance
"Who are you, why'd you save me, what's this all about?"
I'm barely hanging on, I'm nearly passing out
Then the voice said "don't worry love, you're safe with us"
It was this chick named Seduction from this clique called Lust
After that, I feel a sharp pain in my back
They hit me with a sedative and everything went black

[Interlude]
"Madam Seduction, you have to come and see this
I've never seen anything like this before in all my years of practice in medicine
This graph reference is the brain activity normal-vested human being
This is The Prophet's current brain activity
It seems he placed himself in some sort of a self-induced coma, allowing him to heal three times as fast as a normal human being
Moves like this, he should be out for a week
While His vital signs is stabilizing
I think he's coming, too"

[Verse 2]
I woke up a few days later in a hospital bed
Kinda dizzy from the drugs, bandages on my head
The wound on my stomach had been cauterized closed
Snatched the IV out my arm, "where the fuck are my clothes?"
A nurse named Essence runs in, said that I should relax
If I waited a few moments, Seduction would be back
She came in and said that she want to make me an offer
Something about the way she spoke, I couldn't keep my eyes off her
Then I started feeling woozy so I sat my ass down
She said Ignorance days is numbered, Lust is taking over town
I did not understand the motive of the seductress
'Cause I remembered when she murdered Truth and Justice
Now here's where the situation gets complex
If I take Ignorance down, would The Prophet be next?
I remember the words of Wisdom, so I answered with note
Then she informs me that I'm poisoned and she has the antidote
I flew into a rage and started flipping shit over
Seduction held her ground, keeping her composure
She said "you're wasting time fucking with me
You had 24 hours, now you have 23"

[Interlude: Ignorance speaking]
"Hello Seduction. Did The Prophet take the bait?
Oh he did, did he?
For your sake, I hope he shows up on time
Because if he doesn't, your sister will make a lovely addition to my harem
Ahahahahahahahahaha
Ahahaha"

[Verse 3]
They gave me hi-tec weaponary and all the pertinent information
Maps, floor plans, and Ignorance location
He changed up the game since our first confrontation
He used to play the library, but now it's the TV station
My 7th sense told me I was in grave danger
So I hit my man Courage on his two-way pager
I hope he gets the message if you know what I mean
'Cause I'm down to our 18
I cut through the lock with the laser beam
I took out Anger and Fear, some of the meanest guys on Ignorance team
I make it to the next locked door as I start to cut
All the lights come on, another motherfucking set up
My finger's on the trigger, but before I could bust
I'm disarmed by Seduction and surrounded by Lust
A bunch of female assassins with asses fatter than strippers
I hear a buzzing noise, and they had them clippers
My chest tightens up, I fall down
The clippers hit my head, my dreads hit the ground
Seduction comes over, looks me in the face, and gives me a kiss
I'm thinking "it can't end like this"

[Outro]
The saga continues
