[Verse 1: Jeru the Damaja]
I'm on the train late nights where cocksuckers and bulldykes, re-
-ligious fanatics, whinos get into night fights
Homeless people sleepin' in the chair by the door
Smellin' straight like ass, sticky shit on the floor, word
Bums rush the car in orange vest and hats
Mad trash on the tracks, bigger than cats
Niggas is mean muggin' for some like, yo, they buggin'
But I know they all drunk, so we don't mean nothin'
Po-Po jump on to deep lookin' noy
Thinkin' 'bout the situations that they hope to aviod
Lookin' shorty in the cut, big butt and all wobbly
Fuck around and get burnt like thrid degree
Word to G, hip between the cars if you gots to pee
Ain't no other city in the world like NYC
But I ain't gotta tell ya, I think y'all know
Here's my stop, I gots to go

[Hook: Jeru the Damaja]
New York, it's the city of schemes
The city of fiends, the city of dreams
New York, we got boroughs of Kings
Boroughs of Queens and boroughs of fiends
New York, it's the city of schemes
The city of fiends, the city of dreams
New York, we got boroughs of Kings

[Verse 2: Jeru the Damaja]
Everybody reps the team, it's either Knicks, Mets or Yanks
Long Island for white stanks, central Brooklyn still stinks
Guidos hit the club in the city with they bitch
Gettin' drunk out they mind, startin' fights and shit
Crackheads beg for dope, but they be holdin' bricks
Hunts Point got pimps, hoes and dumb tricks
[?] blow that dro
And get some Henny in them and they turn into nymphos
Stick up kids and hustlin' pros
The Deuce is filled with tourists, undercover Five-O
Bright lights on big buildings, [?] national day
Run aways and port authority, the bathrooms smell horribly
Mass transit, one, two and three
Ain't no other city in the world compares to NYC
But I ain't gotta tell ya that, I think y'all know
Here's my stop, I'm off to the studio

[Hook: Jeru the Damaja]
New York, it's the city of schemes
The city of fiends, the city of dreams
New York, we got boroughs of Kings
Boroughs of Queens and boroughs of fiends
New York, it's the city of schemes
The city of fiends, the city of dreams
New York, we got boroughs of Kings
