[Ignorance]
Well Prophet
It seems like you're in a bit of a jam
I hope you can unstick yourself, Oh
And what you did to my wife
It was nothing, I have others
Hahahahahaha
The Saga Continues......

[Verse 1]
It's been a while since I escaped the library
Fightin ignorance everyday, its gettin weary
When I think I got him
He pulls a slip on me
And theres so many soldiers
In his fiendous ass army
One of the fiercest, is this nigga named Tricknology
The last time we met, he got the drop on me
Shit happens so fast he even got some of my family
Blasted my way up out the building
When I catch him Im gon kill him
Track him uptown, where I hear he's lyin to children
1-2-5th's the stop, go outside I hear gunshots
Run up the block
Greedy Lou's dead infront of the materialistic crack spot
Trick's yellin out this is my block
I would've hit him, but I didn't have a clear shot
An innocent bystander might get popped
Damn....a small thang cuz the prophet still can't be stopped

[Trick talking]
What...thats right, this is my motherfuckin life
Trick-nol-ogy, you know what Im sayin
You know me, you can't front on me....

[Verse 2]
Im in a fucked up position
But if he squeezes again, Im gon lift em
A few seconds later now here comes the siren
Oh shit its the pork chop patrol
Their on Ignorance's payroll
And they only came to hold...
Tricknolog down, scoup Greedy Lou off the ground
Throw him in the back of a truck
One yells 'What the fuck nigga ya lookin at?
Now get the fuck outta here'
Then I get that feeling that I feel when danger is in the air
Then out of nowhere one yells the Prophets over there
Immediatly following mad led is in the air
Picture all posted up like they knew I'd be here
I'd go for what I know
But shit there everywhere
Through in the back and forth my gun gets lost
But I managed to get one high powered thought off
I split 6 pigs that got sawed off
As their bodies break south I proceed to break north
Now shit is lookin dim and you'd think all maybe lost
But the Prophet won't go out at any cost
You could never stop the prophet....

Unit's 1 & 2, Unit's 1 & 2 the prophet has been sighted
If you see him kill him

[Scratching of] can't a damn thing stop me

[Verse 3]
I head toward the train station
My force did stop most of the ammunition
Still I need medical attention
But Im not bitchin ,gettin Ignorance is my mission
All of a sudden Greedy Lou comes creepin
Around the corner talkin bout..Prophet your a gonna
We knew you followed Trick uptown because you wanna
Get rid of Ignorance but that dont make no sense
He runs the world I know this from experience
Why don't you come & work wit us
You'll see the boss' game is nice
That night...Greedy Lou died twice
Now I'm wanted, pork chop patrol has a warrant
But that still can't stop the Prophet

Here ye, here ye the court of Ignorance is now in session
We, judge and the jury find the Prophet
Guilty in the murder of Greedy Lou
One of our close personal homeboys
So for that the sentence is death
When you find him execute him
