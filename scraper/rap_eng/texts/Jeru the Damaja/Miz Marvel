Intro/Chorus
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, all the way

{Miz Marvel}
The first verse, perfect design conquest your desert thirst
Highly blessed, can't recept the evil luers curse
From the mansion to the slums, where the evil luers lurk
My life's work, want it so bad it hurts
I see through your facade like nipples through wet shirt
Mic experts, manipulate out thru the universe
Bitches wit dicks, reveal how niggas livin in skirts
Perverts, I put to death and throw to hell head first
My word is plated gold, isin't equal the work
Mental birth can show signs of movin Heaven and Earth
Never deal or take car, wear your heart in your dirt
Rhymes baptised in fire and never been burnt

Chorus

{Miz Marvel}
As I flex, on the set we ghetto intellect
My minds def, twice that of an all time vet
Quietest cat, rock around with no concept
Hit the L start choking and sleep with one eye open
You can try me, until I can get under your skin like poison ivy
Words invincible, hit it strictly for the pledgin principal
Continual, pen is like my sword I feel the armor
Hypnotic melodies, never gympsy steak charmer
Hearts is eye, blaze a stronger than a marijuana
You think I'm done, no, got dot.comma
My persona, change your heart to ghetto primadonnas
With maddic overdose like that guy from Nirvana
Time was cut short, like a fair weather friend
But if they gone, then I don't need them
Can I get an amen

Chorus 2X

{Miz Marvel}
Cast a spell, on all non believing inphadeles
Heroz4Hire, exclusive list the clientele
Make your head swell, legal spinning like a carosel
Sweet as caramel, transform into Miz Marvel
Queen lady of the Supahaman Klik Cartel
If I need a bonecrusher, call up on the sun toucher
In camouflage, gone just like a desert mirage
Try to escape the fate, safe in proper sabotage
Lyrical massage, sounded like comitcally shape
My verbal swordplay, bounces off the walls like richochets
Compete, with the style that you know your couldn't beat
And I call you niggas pussy, cuz you are what you eat
Complete the cypher, comunicate thru words unspoken
My mission ain't complete, let the circle be unbroken

Chorus 2X
