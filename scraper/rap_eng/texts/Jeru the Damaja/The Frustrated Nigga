[Intro]
Out of the fog into the smog, he walks in
He's ready for victory
He walks again by night, ruthlessly
Meeting wit the unknown

[Verse 1]
It's the educated field nigga, trained in guerilla
Warfare plus equipped wit mental hardware
Manifesting organizational skills
Cuz organizational skills kills more devils than bullets
Pull it, the psychological trigger and be a real nigga
Happy as a runaway slave in the jungle
The concrete jungle, here's your scars weary, here's your arms don't fear 'em
But you might die if you bail against the system
Another nigga caught up in the system
To amend my invisible chains and deviate from the system
No longer shall I be a victim
Victimized, circumsized by the lies of the system
It's equivalent to being nonexisent
I used to be a pawn in the game
Now I change my postion, I'm making moves
Beware of the frustrated nigga
Know what I'm saying

[Verse 2]
Ride the pale horse, triumphantly
Put a saddle on his back, take him to hell and back
You can take a nigga out the jungle
But you can't take the jungle out the cat
Black cats, brown cats, all types of cats
Mental fusion, it's no illusion, or delusion
Of grandeur but the way we were
And will be and ever shall be
Eternally but you mask my present existence
In ignorance, mock my appearance
Yet yearn for my esscence, steal my lessons
So I reeducate, unlearn what
Was taught, hold down the fort
Each one teach one, now I got support
We don't need no water, let the muthafuka burn
Down to the ground
America, America, the beautiful thoughts
From a frustrated nigga
You know what I'm saying

[Verse 3]
Systematic, destruction of the original man
Drugs by nigga on nigga
Cocaine, morphine, nicotine
The evil of men run through my bloodstream
And the blood of kings runs through my bloodstream
This dignified bastard
Hazardous to the health of America
Black rebel in your area
Psychoanalyze this
Then send your forces cuz now we mean business
You should now bear witness to a new breed of nigga
This nigga is smarter than the nigga of time's past
This nigga is the nigga of the future
This nigga will emancipate himself from the title of nigga
And restore his title as king
So beware, beware, beware, beware
The frustrated nigga
