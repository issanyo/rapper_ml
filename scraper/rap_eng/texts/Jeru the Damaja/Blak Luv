*scratching*
*Down the world is...*

{Jeru The Damaja}
This is to my brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Avoid jail legend, fingerprints on full metal
Jackets like design, so that you can't hack it
But you musn't get caught up in these devilish tactics
Never let the man pull ya string like Geppetto
The game's the same, boricua or moreno
Don't watch ya step and you be like, mi amigo
Forenzics made the maps, so now he's on death row
Yo what's the steelo, real brothers do it on the d-low
Knowing's have the battle, so now you know
To be on point, cuz anybody can be a casualty
Some brothers lost there life, fuckin with O.P.P
Um robbery and P.C.P
From the cradle to the state penitentary
He'll be in the middle of next century
Ask me, is it crying SAKNE
You got to watch how you flow and you will grow
If not you get tripped up in the ghetto

Chorus 2X
This is for the youth blak luv
This is for the ghetto, blak luv, blak luv

{Jeru The Damaja}
This is to my brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Sellin yae yo, playin c-lo, duckin po-po
Some brothers got murdered over a kilo
5-0 ask questions, but nobody know
What's the M.O., another brother trying to get dough
Be careful how you live, cuz that's how you go
Wild like Rambo, get shot down by the Commando
Call your co-defendent sing like D'Angelo
No problemo, but upstate you sing soprano
Police sadimize, a man at the 7-0
Be careful where you go yo, and just in case you ain't know
I flow, to liberate the ghetto

Chorus 4X

{Jeru The Damaja}
This is to my brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Trying to be like Pablo, DeNiro, Al Pacino
You be all right until you run up on Columbo
Get caught red handed, so you got to go
You lose the crib, the car, the women and the dough
This can't be happenin so you like "Oh No"
So avoid this fate, and absorb the conscious flow
This is not a demo, strictly for the ghetto
Not the limo, work for the pimp, hustler and the ho
And I'm gonna let you know
Whether you as black as jack or brown as nino
Blak Luv, is what we need to flow
From the ghetto

Chorus 4X
