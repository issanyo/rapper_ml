[Sample: (?)]
I wanna speak to you
I wanna speak to you
You're concerned about the fate of the human race

[Verse: Jeru The Damaja]
Look up in the sky
Its not a pimp but the black flint
Intelligent as fuck but dirty like the US government
Ya'll trying to live like rappers
But you get none of the benefits
They using BET and shit
To keep ya'll niggas ignorant
I heard they (?) to say that I'm irrelevant
The devil been real busy
Cause now narcissisms the dominant
The way these niggas act
Man prison is the consequence
This rap shits an illusion like the black president
Damn
That's a bad bitch
Today that shit a compliment
Instead of getting smarter
(?) less articulate
They training our intelligence and hip-hops the instrument
I have a sense of duty so a brother here to circumvent
Blind leading blind man
You think that's a coincidence
These cats committing crimes
And I'm here to present the evidence
Word to god this shit is sickening
Rapping used to be hard but now its so effeminate
(Your days are numbered)
Who got on the mic
Doing work
Yo its the black Kirk
Incredible as fuck how they manipulate your mind like church
Niggas on these records talking about how their team put in work
Fuckin' with these shorty's head because they never did real dirt
Fuck around with body guards 'cause they're scared to get hurt
They claim they're living dangerous but strictly safety first
Yo
I keep it gully, fuck if your bubble burst
All that killer monologue with you on stage, you a skirt
(?) I thought it'd be better but its just getting worse
Cause shit they spit is the opposite of quality first
'Member when the game used to be diverse
Now almost every single record one repetetive verse
I'm about to drop a bomb and watch 'em all disperse
'Bout to go beserk until the trends reversed
So all ya'll metrosexuals hold on to your purse
Remember sins of the father, they leave the seeds cursed
