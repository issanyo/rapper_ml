(Jeru the Damaja...)
(...and it goes like this)

For all you new jacks that never heard me spit
Bring beats, rhymes, and freaks and watch me split shit
Bang like Bloods and Crips
Too legitimate to quit
MC's talk big but sonic waves crack your helmet
Before long, the chicken heads crush they pelvic
Bones, I blow up spot-slam microphones
Thinkin' 'bout pacing? Dog, adjust yo' tone
Fuck rhymin', I leave your eyes shinin' like chrome
Rims, Main course, knuckle sandwich and .10's
Try and wet me, I multiply like gremlins
I'm a vet in the game, I know the outs and ins
Still, I'm constantly beefin' like cowboys and Indians
Outlaw star, like Gene Starwind kickin' that crazy shit like a soccer hooligan
So money break yourself, you know what's good for your health
Call me ninja not nigga cuz I move in stealth
Mode, after this joint your headphones explode
I rhyme in beeps and blips so I can rhyme in morse code
Flow like ocean, salt water erode
When the mic is in my grip it is sure to corrode, and
I glide across the beat like Jordan
Leave competition hole-y like a Mormon
Potent as dust, I have you all stumblin'
Smoke too much, you space the fuck out like Flash Gordon
Rock this shit, from mornin' to mornin'
It's so hot it have rappers wanna stop recordin'
Sort of Superman, so Lois Lane reportin'
Swing like Spidey, so chumps hate me like Jay Jonah Jameson
If I miss I take aim again
Throwin' fire like the Human Torch and leavin y'all faggots flamin'
Play yo' fuckin' self if you think I'm gamin'
Create Earthquakes that have your core tremblin'
Be number 9 like the love potion
Can't clock my moves cuz I move in slow motion
(motion)
(motion)
(motion... and it goes like this)
