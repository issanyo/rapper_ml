[Verse 1]
Its the raw high majestic
Universally respected, divinely protected
Many mics molested by my rhyming method
Dirty rotten from BK to PL
Think I fell off
You got jokes like Dave Chappelle
Call me Waldo
Cause you don't know where I'm at in the world
International rhyme shark
Marksman like William Tell
The original
The niggas more bitch than a shemale
All that rah-rah
You'd probably be a girl in the cell
Lord's my witness
I'm giving these cats the business
Knocking back shots of vodka
With my foolish gangster princess
On Christmas
That's everyday the way I shoot the gift
In some parts of the world
They call me black St. Nicholas
Ridiculous amounts of style
Flowing out of my orifice
Spit nasty shit
Like what went out of that bitch in The Exorcist
If you insist
I could fulfill your death wish
Peep this raw hardcore
And fatter than Wilson (?)
So

[Hook]
Tell your peeps about it
Tell your click about it
Tell your people 'bout it
Tell 'em all about it
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw
Tell your click about it
Tell your peeps about it
Tell your crew about it
Tell 'em all about it
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw

[Verse 2]
I mastered the trade
(?) sharpened the blade
The dopest high grade
This a raid
Nobody move, nobody get sprayed
Mind blower
Slam into your planet like a meteor
Insane flame thrower
Sporting rhymes galore
Its the hardcore
Hitting like a two by four
And if you think that its a game lame
I still tap your jaw, its war
You could call the whole Marine Corp
I take 'em out one by one
Similar to the Predator
Word to mother
You ain't know why I'm a bad mother fucker
From the streets of east New York
To the gutters of Calcutta
I ain't stutter
This is the say you sucker emcees will lay
Lyrical AK, you can say is how my mind spray
Dropping bombs on the spot
Like if its D-Day
I make you wanna quit rap and take up ballet
Tinkerbell ass mother fuckers
Its Brooklyn
So

[Hook]
Tell your peeps about it
Tell your click about it
Tell your people 'bout it
Tell 'em all about it
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw
Tell your click about it
Tell your peeps about it
Tell your crew about it
Tell 'em all about it
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw

[Verse 3]
Word is born
I wreck the microphone
So leave it alone
You weak and (?)
When you address me watch your tone
Niggas is clones
Faker than titties of silicone
On the real
When did emcess start standing for (?)
Get your head flown
My rap snaps your backbone
And your poems are so weak
They need shots of testosterone
I'm probably dead wrong
But you remind me of estrogen
Talking tough like a killa
Bust off with that baby skin
And daffodils
But here's the deal, I'm for real
I'm blessed with pure skill
And harder than raw steel
(?) like Steven Segal
Hard To Kill
And my rhymes more exotic than those broads in Brazil
No holds barred
I go hard when its time to record
Murder beats and in the sheets
Freaks they call me ultralord
If you get caught in the crosshairs
Do you will get clapped
Peel your skull cap back black
So call it a rap
So

[Hook]
Tell your peeps about it
Tell your click about it
Tell your people 'bout it
Tell 'em all about it
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw
Tell your click about it
Tell your peeps about it
Tell your crew about it
Tell 'em all about it
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw
We so raw
