Listen
There you go
You heard it from somebody who's been there
So now its time for us to put our heads together
And fight this thing that may destroy the lives of millions of millions of young people
This wackness that goes under many different names
Television, music, entertainment
Its not even thought-provoking
Just senseless chatter designed to destroy the minds of our youth
So join with me today
And let the world know that we've had enough
And that we're not gonna take it anymore
Let them know that if you're wack
Or dealing wackness
Your time is up
Attack the wack
Attack the wack
