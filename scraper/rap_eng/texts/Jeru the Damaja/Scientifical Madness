[Hook x2]
Scientifical Madness

Scientifical Madness
My status is the baddest

[Verse 1]
There's a hole in the ozone layer
I'm rippin vampires
You think I give a fuck
Who's the biggest player
Or who's got the fattest bank roll
What is it if a man gains the world
And lose his own soul?
Bioengineered, mutated chickens
Niggas lickin' one another
Brother killin' brother
And you demon muthafuckas
Start coastal rivalries
The worlds greatest lust is jewelery
Mind Jah lick you with disease
So I inflict MC's like Ebola
Or some other man made cancer
Fuck a two-hundred dollar sweater
We need to try and reach the niggas
On the corner
But all we do is create drug dealers
Envy then creates murderers
Diamond rings, pretty hoes
Fat chains, expensive things
Just watch which way
Ya burner swings in this world of...

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Chemical warfare
The telephoner acts like he lives here
The government is putting mad shit in the air
Projects are strategically set up
In the case that shit erupt
They easily blown up
Poisonous gases
The so-called righteous help for the masses
But it's them that judge their own asses
Knowing what their task is
But still receding, ass backwards
Do you need to ask me who the devil is
Some may call it showbizz
I just call 'em hypocrites
Cause they don't teach the children shit positive
Like how a man should live
They only focus on the negative
So they're stuck in the ghetto
While you drive a car and got a condo
It's all for the dough yo
It's killing your own people
Profits greater than (?Peneco?)
Forget about whats equal
In this world of...

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Artificially inseminated
White bitches have babies most black youth are incarcerated
In the ghetto babies having babies but no loot
So most pregnancies are terminated
Warlocks keep the covenant
And the souls of the ignorant ones empower it
It's transparent
You see Uncle Sam as your parent
When America has beef you jump up to defend it
But you can still be a defendant
Ask my co-defendant
And we're both innocent
Every black man in America faces imprisonment
Ridicule, and torment
But in this tournament
The chosen few shall be triumphant
And the devil will be decapitated
So you can keep your duckets
And your dressing, I won't be emasculated
In this world of...
