[Intro: Bounty Killer]
Lawd a mercy
A who dem a try devour, me and mi 45 Haskell got the power
Lawd a mercy
Copper shot and Black Rhino gonna tek dem like a rain and storm and shower
Lawd a mercy
Dem gonna die this hour
Well!


[Chorus: Bounty Killer]
A suicide or murder
Dem diss Junglist wit dem ya big long gun ya
Plus Tivoli man dem nuh come ya fi linger
Boy head a buss like a gas cylinder
Again
A suicide or murder
Dem diss Seaview wit dem ya brand new gun ya
Waterhouse badman nuh come ya fi linger
Dem head is like a bus with gunshot passenger
Yes boy

[Verse One: Bounty Killer]
As me see mi contender
I nah retreat and mi nah surrender
Gunshot attack dem like a rat inna blender
Gunshot dem get and Riverton a di sender
Hey dem shoulda know, mi a di Earth defender
Wild like a tiger or yu kick like ninja
Gun nuh have no sense and it nuh have no behavior
If yu fuck yourself, mi gun get outta order
Nuh ready to kill, then wha you a do een ya?
Diss man from Rockfort and man from Rema
Gleaner!

[Chorus: Bounty Killer]
A suicide or murder
Dem diss Dunkirk wit dem ya big long gun ya
Southside badman nuh come ya fi linger
Dem head a explode like a gas cylinder
Yes boy

[Verse Two: Jeru]
Murder them, murder them
Test the most high, it's a suicide mission
MCs dead, all others fled, fearing the power
Thunder and lightning, lyrics like hot lead showers
In the desert or in the jungle
When I bust off shots, I blow up spots and competition turns humble
Guns rumble, bodies tumble but I can't be injured
When I kill off the contenders, I escape like a ninja

[Chorus: Bounty Killer]
A suicide or murder
Dem diss Rockfort wit dem ya big long gun ya
And me and mi gun dem nuh come ya fi linger
Boy head a buss like a gas cylinder
Again!
A suicide or murder
Dem diss ??? man wit dem ya big long gun ya
Burro Banton dem nuh come ya fi linger
Now your head a buss like a gas cylinder
Yes boy



[Verse Three: Bounty Killer]
Mi gun a drive like driver
Just get a medal as a scuba diver
Boy say dem wise but Jazzwad dem wiser
Long time we deya as some great survivor
Tan deh seh yu wicked and yu bad like spider
Kill or be killed, that's eeda or eida
Sluggy Rankin, him nah go pet dem neither
Yes boy

[Chorus: Bounty Killer]
A suicide or murder
Dem diss Junglist wit dem ya big long gun ya
Black Roses dem nuh come ya fi linger
Now your head a buss like a gas cylinder
Again!
A suicide or murder
Dem diss Maxfield wit dem ya big long gun ya
And Sunrise dem nuh come ya fi linger
Smaddy head buss like a gas cylinder
Yes boy

[Verse Four: Jeru]
When my mind spray, you must get flat
Or snatch up your girl and gun and shoot your way out the back
When I fire, the lingo blows out your rib cage
You retire the sound and not because of old age
Blood splatters and holy fire turns to dawn
Killing smooth and silently like the Rasta James Bond
Armed and dangerous, so grab your pistols
But like an MX missile, I'll rip right through you
Some rather die, then face a fate worse than hell
With a bounty on your hood and Bounty Killer on your tail

Chorus
