[Interlude: Jeru the Damaja]

Yeah, Jeru the Damaja
The master of microphone mayhem
Representing that real hip-hop
You know, I don't know what the fuck ya'll motherfuckers is doing
But I'll be spitting that dope
Know what I mean?
I put it down like this:

[Verse 1: Jeru the Damaja]

I always get respect, I'm high-tech like computer love
Niggas don't approach me talk tough but [?] mostly
And even though you holler I don't think that you're rough enough
Fuck it money knuckle up and get your shit bust
I'm so funky even rock-n-roll heads want me
Come off the wall get cracked the fuck up like humptey, dumptey
I'm busting shots like I'm still on the block
Real G's hold their own, fake thugs call the cops
Dont need guns, just the warriors drums
Of course, the force, rip off your mog like dum-dums
So go ahead and act dumb
I use my mike like a magnum
And send you back where you came from
Wild on the track, run first shut the spot down
Cats is getting hurt, like convicts on lockdown
On the real, I'm that negro pound for pound
Leave your click wet like water, break your mp3 recorder
Play lowkey, but never sneak like a ninja
So much the Man, crackers in the clan wanna be a nigga
Go figure, now i [?] your honey figure, Moe
Pop your luck in the hood then Moe liquor
Get them tipsy, like Heineken mixed with 'Henney
Burn MC's worse than Kenwill Mars burn penny
On good times, I'm the [?] for rocking minds
My pops the root on the block, with the fat dimes
True climbs and confessions, jam sessions, heads bop, chickens' heads quap, they said they prese 'cause like blessin'
The Lord never stressin', fuck you perception, I'm the motherfucker on the mike; no question
From state to state, I'm holding mad weight
But not drugs, the bulletproof munk deflects slugs of hate
Where's my hat, I'm 'bout to dig out your date
I guess you's a lame, she says she like the way I love me
All hail the king when I swing like kong
Stay cool and calm, blow like an atom bomb
Blow shit up
Like Zorro, you can call me the Don Diego
Fuck a hook I got 'em hooked like yayo
[?] Brooklyn cats just don't know how to act
Fuck what you thought was dope, this shit is the crack

The Crack
