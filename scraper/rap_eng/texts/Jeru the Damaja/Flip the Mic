This is how you flip the microphone
How you flip the microphone
This is how you flip the mic

This is how you flip the microphone
And I want stop flippin shit until I'm forced to retire because...

I knew had to have since the day I first met her
Spent the rest of my life writing down ways to get her
I really didn't know what I was doin back then
But now my g's so tight I flip her and her friends
And bring those mic pimps - they ain't no match
Flippin like tricks, the ones I smash know it's no strings attached
Fake players, flash trappings, some fall for the booty
I finesse 'em on they back and aim an inch above the booty
When I rip, they can get freaky like a porno movie
I rock it like Jet Li, you beat it like Hong Kong Phooey
You a cartoon character like Huey, Dewey or Louie
With the mic thrust I tear it down like a tsunami
Destroy the walls like a one man army
That's why you pay to (?) and I funk for free
You see....

This is how you flip the microphone
How you flip the microphone
This is how you flip the mic

This is how you flip the microphone
How you flip the microphone
How you flip the mic

This is how you flip the microphone
How you flip the microphone
This is how you flip the mic

(Scratching) I restructure to come bust and rush ya
(Scratching) With the physical and spiritual tactics
(Scratching) I restructure to come bust and rush ya
(Scratching) And I want stop flippin shit until I'm forced to retire because...

I wreck the hundreds across seas
I even killed emcees for disrespecting my ladies
The thought of rippin them makes me crazy
I like it raw like Ol' Dirty so let em have my babies
My name'll live on for eternity
When it comes to freakin it I get nasty
Soundsystems crowd for (uh) me
Fill em up with gems to teach the babies
But this is type explicit, so Parental Advisory
You'll probably never see it on MTV Rockumentary
Me and she be fighting for justice and equality
Although her friends still make me horny
I'm an emcee - flip em if they press up on me
Everyone I bone did moan and groan
Cause...

This is how you flip the microphone, you see
This is how you flip the microphone
How you flip the microphone
This is how you flip the mic

This is how you flip the microphone
How you flip the microphone
How you flip the mic

This is how you flip the microphone
How you flip the microphone
This is how you flip the mic, flip the mic

Peace... Jeru the Damaja, Perverted Monks, right now
Wit my boys from Grand Central, doin it like that
Brooklyn, USA - Manchester, UK
Know what I mean? Across seas... like that
We out - this is how you flip the microphone

(Scratching) I restructure to come bust and rush ya
(Scratching) With the physical and spiritual tactics
(Scratching) I restructure to come bust and rush ya
(Scratching) The only thing you feel is the pain
(Scratching) I restructure to come bust and rush ya
(Scratching) The only thing you feel is the pain
