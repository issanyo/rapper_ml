[Verse 1]
Knowledge I drop it
Try hard you can't stop it
"Who you Is?"
Rasta Powers
I run with the Prophet
Super solar strength plus high intelligence
I dedicate my life to hunting down ignorance
I'll never call him mister
Kidnapped his bitch sisters
Seduction and lust
Force fed â€˜em jewels now they roll with us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I won't stop until this devil evil empire is crushed
Rich men I annihilate 'em
And escape with no abrasions
I did not kneel but could not steel to Temptation
So now I'm hated by the family
Took the head of his brother Pain and toruted his cousin Agony
Killed his wife Spite and burnt up his baby
Their demise was a thrill
Each kill got more fun to me
I know tha Prophet thinks I'm going crazy
Live by it die by it
Can't a damn thing stop me
I'm Rasta Powers
[Chorus]
Can't a damn thing stop me
Ya white Superman
Can't a damn thing stop me
Ya white Superman
[Verse 2]
I kill the lowman on the totem pole up to the high commander
I fight for Truth and Right
And could care less about a bystander
Old ladies and babies get hit in cross fire
Like when I gunned down Desire
And [?] The empire
She said she heard I was a gun for hire
I didn't know her
So I checked her for weapons and wires
Something's wrong
Still I let her go on
She said she wanted someone gone
Ignorance and he's down at Hoyt and Schermerhorn
In tha building by tha train station
My 7th sense went buckwild when I heard the location
She hasn't noticed I had come to the realization
It was a setup
So I pulled out my joint and shot the bitch up
I'm Rasta Powers
[Chorus]
Can't a damn thing stop me
Ya white Superman
Can't a damn thing stop me
Ya white Superman
[Verse 3]
Ignorance is cunnin'
But I'm constantly gunnin'
Wielding my blades into a fate
And cuttin' down his evil minions
Assassinate the captains of his legions
I was once overwhelmed Despair and Depression
They thought they had a nigga
Said I'd die by decapitation
Let off sonic, electromagnetic, radiation, vibration, smokescreen
No more Rasta Powers
Breakout regroup their dead in 24 hours
Their demise was a thrill to me
Every shot every kill became more fun to me
I know tha Prophet thinks I'm going crazy
Live by it die by it
Can't a damn thing stop me
I'm Rasta Powers
[Chorus]
Can't a damn thing stop me
Ya white Superman
Can't a damn thing stop me
Ya white Superman
