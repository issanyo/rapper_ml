(Chorus)
When your dreams are broken pieces
The world can be a cold and cruel place

(Verse 1: Ill Bill)
Yo, Yo, speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Skinny waist, fat ass, pretty face, evil mouth
Hollywood, partied with fake thugs, posers, and cokeheads
Her uncle was the ex-drummer from Guns n' Roses
Met her over Joey Silvera's house, a party girl
She was 19 and happy that her parents finally let her out
Three abortions, two from the same boyfriend
The third one during an orgy, might have been Sean Penn's
Yeah, I put it in her mouth once and we remained friends
Seen her out at the clubs now and again, the same shit
The same sneaky crowd, same cocaine, same tits
Same dreams about becoming a star and making ?
Played a hooker on Entourage, swore she made it
Made friends with the wrong crowd, got played quick
Took the first sniff of that grey shit then ate dick
Dummy ate her first syringe was never the same since, listen

(Chorus X2)

(Verse 2: Jeru tha Damaja)
Check it out, he a self proclaimed thug but the kid could rap
His idol was 2Pac, he was always wanted to act
Portray a thug on the silver screen
Show Hollywood the block, just had the rock, just one last scheme
With this move he financed a demo
Planned to vic a spot, they mixed coke with other chemicals
His team the neighbourhood criminals
Guess they missed the truth about birds of a feather
? Part of the plot, nobody move but motherfuckers still get shot
Grab the shit and head back to the block
He ain't know, a witness seen him come and go from both the rooftops
First, they murked his moms and his pops, then his girl and her seed
Slit her throat then filled the kid with shots
Paramedics did what they could
RIP, another mural on a wall in the hood

(Chorus X2)

(Verse 3: Slaine)
When you were younger, under your bed there was a monster
Between your legs where he wants you he haunts you
Still to this day, you got little to say
'Bout the nightmares you kept that had you widdled away
There's a little girl, a victim who's a diddler's prey
But you shut up, now you grown up, all fucked up
? tongue slippin through your heart
Nowadays the same stuff's rippin' you apart
You're 26, tryin to get rich quick
High heels, lipstick, slidin' down poles
They don't call you miss now, they call you "this bitch"
That bitch bend over backwards
Throw a dollar at you and that's it
You've been bruised and scraped, abused and raped
And so drained from cocaine and dudes and snakes
If somebody had to walk a day inside your shoes they'd shake
It's like you never had a chance to choose your fate, wait

(Chorus X2)
