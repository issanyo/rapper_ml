I met this honey named Yolanda
You would not believe the things that I told her
She had potential so I thought that I would mold her (Break it down son)
You would usually see me and her around town
She had this way that was so sexy
Everytime I think about it-makes me woozy
And her rear end was just so nice and juicy
Plus a mind that you would not believe, no tricks up her sleeve
So we dated, like Janet Jackson, we waited
A while and waited and waited
I started to wonder would I ever get in it
Finally the invitation was extended
With that I said "Mi casa es su casa"
Meet me at my pad tomorow-about six o'clock
No question-the next day, we kissin' and caressin'
Before long, we starts to undress and
With that I pulls out my pack of hats
She looks me dead in the eye and says "What's that?"
I said "Don't tell me that you don't know what condoms is for"
She says "Yeah, but the average nigga'll love to hit it raw"
And I said

I'm not your average nigga
No I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me, I'm not your average nigga

No, I'm not your average nigga
Girlfriend, I'm not your average nigga
No, no, you know I'm not your average nigga

(Yo Ru! Yo these honeys be on some shit for real. Yo tell me about the
Other honey you was kickin' it to)

I met this honey named Tamika
My intentions was more than just to freak her
Since I'm GodI thought that I teach her (Where'd you meet her at, black?)
The Tunnel so you know it didn't happen like that
I got her name and her number
I said "Girlfriend, I just wonder
Could you come home with me?" She said "Uh-uh
But you got the digits-ring me up tomorow and see where it leaves ya at
We started speakin'
We planned to hook up that next weekend
We discussed the place of our meeting, she said "Come to my projects
Sometimes niggas be buggin, but I get mad respect"
So like a dummy, I went to scoop up this young honey
Gassed up by the fat ass and flat tummy
But when I rolled up
It start to look just like a set-up
Now I'm mad hot, but this time I played it cool
Recognized one nigga I used to run with in high school
I said "You know Tamika?" He said "Yeah I know the whore"
Got me on the elevator and led me to her door
When I rung the bell she was mad surprised
She flung the door wide open with a wild look in her eyes
I said, yo

I'm not your average nigga
You see, I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me cuz I'm not your average nigga

I'm not your average nigga
Girlfriend, I'm not your average nigga
Oh no, you know I'm not your average nigga

(scratch-"Chain nigga"-scratch-"here you comin' but your steps are to loud
Standing on the corner, thought him was cool"-scratch-"chain nigga"

I met this honey named Sabrina
I thought that this time this one would be the Queen of
My dreams, but you know how that goes (God, I heard it before)
So let me tell you what happened one day I'm outside her door
And we're talking about how her ex-boyfriend be stalking
She said she thought she saw him when we were walking
But I said "Don't worry about it
Put that shit to the side, and slide up in the crib"
So we're lampin', she's still shook up about what happened
I said "Don't sweat it, he's probably just rappin'"
She said "Little do you know
Last week he threw a brick threw my bedroom window"
I said "Whatever, I don't think he's that crazy"
She said "You never, know where he may be"
All of a sudden, out of nowhere
The crazy mothafucka jumped out on me
I made him melt with a blow to the head
And before I bounced, this is what I said
I said

Yo I'm not your average nigga
No, I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me cuz I'm not your average nigga

Mista, I'm not your average nigga
No, I'm not your average nigga
Oh no, you know, I'm not your average nigga
