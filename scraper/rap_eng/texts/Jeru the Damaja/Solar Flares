[Verse 1]
Ayo the way I move defies the laws of physics
I travel through dimensions writing rhymes with the mystics
I reread the fabric of time to be specific
I maneuver through the universe young, black, and gifted
Divine design swift as Tachyon particles
Live from the trenches of Brooklyn it’s the original
Chemistry unaltered by synthetic chemicals
Blessed with the power of God delete your physical
Difficult time only further strengthen the spiritual
Yea that’s crystal clear I fear no individual
No [?] in every line that I rhyme
I’m immersed the soul of soldier from the birth to the Earth
Study the verse my work is so superb it’s a curse
My mind extremely sharp when I think my head hurts
If I keep killing the flow I’m afraid it’ll burst
And the force it generates will destroy the universe

[Hook]
The listener’s symptom is [?] like solar flares (4x)

[Verse 2]
Mind over matter help me explore the galaxy
Time moving things with my rhymes mental telepathy
Chemicals combine with beats advanced alchemy
Math and science master microphone wizardry
Ahead of time futuristic technology
God in the physical form anthropology
Raw bloodline divine genealogy
The word in the time before time cosmogony
Atomic energy flow heterodoxy
Most philosophy is hypocrisy
In the death of the cosmos I’m totally free
Good thing I’m mostly water cuz life is a tree
Here’s the scoop: even in Allah there’s the truth
I’m [?] roots you know what it is by the fruits
I speak couth the beach fuck biochemical suits
I’m afraid the heat I generate will melt the booth

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My vessel is average but my spirit is colossal
2000 years what I write will be the gospel
I send you to life like O2 through your nostrils
Riding lighting bolts trading tales with apostles
Saying do things that’s deemed impossible
Master my realm so in fact it’s logical
Camel through the eye of the needle improbable
Feast for your ears in the flavor delectable
Orgasmic voice but it’s far beyond sexual
Borderline mythical baffle the intellectual
Dissect your science to the last molecule
So electric my brainwave is measured in Joules
The flow intoxicating like a gallon of booze
Universal law and order reinstate the rules
Fate is what you make it
Be wise when you choose
This rhyme a landmine
Blow you out your shoes

[Hook]
