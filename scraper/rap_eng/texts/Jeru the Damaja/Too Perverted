Ain't nothin worse than a wack MC
Unfortunately that's all that surrounds me
So I come to crush the unstable structure
It's the return of the dopest Brooklyn motherfucker
To ever, ignite the mic, get it right
Mad respect, pimps grap your hoes
Punks grab your checks
What's next, pure nonsense and the styles ya flex
And your so bloody pussy, you need a kotex
Latex cause they're drippin' vaginal juices
So many so called gangsta niggas and their booty producers
Now watch the act that's vanishin'
Gold and platinum, but who gets the publishin'
Not to rub it in, drop it in your box, now your dubbin'
My company fucked up my projects momentum
But I'm still winnin'
'Cause I'm a winner
Came to the table with snakes they had steaks on their plates
Plus niggas on they're plates, they put figures on my plate
I took the loot and skated
Cause I couldn't dine wit' em
C₁₇H₁₉O₃N
On a podium, at this time you're rewindin'
And like solar and lunar, you're clockin'
It's too perverted

It's too perverted, you heard it

So deep, that it becomes fossilized
Too many times I find my style between MCs inside
(?), but they swallow their tongues like seizures
I pierce flesh and strike nerves like accupuncture
Or accupressure, feel the wrath of my mathematics
Kinetics, you need a local anesthetic
Cause your system has acquired an immune deficiency
Overwhelmed by my telepathy, no sympathy
Curse Caligula but graceful like calligraphy
And (?) like (?) was not to mc
Life givin, yet I'm still deadly
And before you step to me
Remember it's too perverted

It's too perverted
It's too perverted, you heard it
[Repeat 2X]

Mastered rhymin so I'm steadily climbin
I rip through mics like when my dick strikes the hymen
Total controller, some claim to be bolder
But they rotate around the lunar
I keep it solar, polar
Who vibrates and radiates
Thunder, lightning, earthquakes from north to south
East to west test the best get scraped
Drop jewels, burn papes, til my ride escapes
Awkward flow to some it's even unorthodox
Bone crushin, life threatnin like the jaws of a crocodile
Your hunny wishes to stay a while
And I told her she could stay-
Am I foul?, or just too perverted
