(Verse 1, Part 1, Professor D:)

When we speak we don’t ramble, we don’t just preach by the
Mantle, we roll up and teach by example, on the
Streets I can handle that straight up battle rap
And have a cat gasping like he’s having cardiac attack but
After that, you know I’m quick to spit a jewel in this
And put an end to all the foolishness putting solutions in
See what we gave you is more then any one can pay you
And if you don’t believe me you can ask my uncle Jeru!

(Verse 1 Part 2, Jeru:)

Now it’s the return of the frustrated brother
With rhymes more deez then the L.A. governor
I touch the track to educate the people
Swing my mic like Conan, call me Arnold SchwarzeNegro
My goal is not to just expose the scheme of confusion
But to formulate plans and come up with a solution
You want change? Then make a contribution, that’s real
And while you livin’ like a kingpin remember Emit Till

(Chorus, Alternating D and Jeru:)

You’re either in action or you are inaction
You are either discipline or you’re a distraction
You are either positive or you are subtraction
You either propagate the hate or bring the love back in

(Verse 2, Professor D:)

You see with ability comes responsibility
And if you shy away from this it means you violate your kids
We don’t try and make a difference we just do it
It’s just stupid, if you face the screw face
Lying and you got your tongue tying like a shoelace
And you hate to debate because you feel it’s too late
Disregarded like it’s loose change every few days
But if you’d save enough it be a fortune in the new age
And who pays in the long run if you ignore the problem
While you’re lacking interest they’re stacking interest you want um
To pick a pocket like its cool? I’d rather pick a
Pocket like it’s pool, and stick in knowledge in your noggin that’s the
Fuel, when I see a rapper yappin’ ish I could
Smack the bitch but I’d rather teach a man to fish, HipHop
We can manifest in different languages
And bring the world to work together to defeat the capitalist savages!

(Chorus)

(Verse 3, Jeru:)

Now I don’t sell crack or bust caps on wax I just
Flow on groves, drop jewels and hard facts
This ain’t no job it’s personal
I got more weight on my back then KG in that kick commercial
Like mind complete the circle it’s universally dope
I’m hanging politicians my vote’s the rope
You gotta be involved I’m telling you
Some talk the talk but never do
Turn off your TV and get a clearer view
Channel zero scrambles your frontal lobe
Education helps decipher the code
One push of the button and the world explodes
Ignorance was the tool when the slaves were sold
So I never try to sell the youth them gangster looks
I entice ‘em with lyrics and give ‘em books
I hope this catches the ear of whoever’s bumpin’ me
You don’t like the system? Start your own record company

(Chorus)
