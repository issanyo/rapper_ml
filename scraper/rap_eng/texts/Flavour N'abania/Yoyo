YOYO

Sing o like no one is listening 
Dance like no one is watching you
Even if them dey looki looki
-Dance o Dance o
Love like there’s no tomorrow 
And if tomorrow come abeg Love again 

Ojo melo la o lo laye -how many days do we have on earth
Ta fi nwo burglary  -that we are wearing burglary proof
Emi o ni waye yi mo ya o -I won’t take this life too hard
Maa logba mi pe -I’ll enjoy my time
Tin ba leku siwon -if I wish them well
Ton ba lejo simi -and they don’t
Ma fife sewon lese -I’ll kill them with kindness and love. 

Yo yo yo
This life is sweet
Enjoy everyday like tomorrow no dey 
Yo yo yo
My life is sweet
I’m living the moment 
Bad belle e quiet
