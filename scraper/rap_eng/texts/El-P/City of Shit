[Acyelaone-Talking]
Fuck is up? What's happening?
Yo, tell you a fucking story
Tell you a fucking story

[EL-P]
Here we go, huh!

[Aceyalone-Hook]
Once upon a time in a city called Shit
Lived a man named "What The Fuck?"

[EL-P]
He used to clown around with his dick in the ground
And one day his dick got stuck

[Aceyalone]
He was kicking and screaming and yelling
And cussing and asking everybody for help

[EL-P]
Then he ran into a man named "Fuck You Too"
And he told 'em he should help himself

[Aceyalone]
He was so frustrated with his dick getting grated
And he had no one to call

[EL-P]
Then he gained control and climbed out the hole
Motherfuck, he barely save his balls

[Aceyalone]
Now every time I think about "What The Fuck?"
I think about you

[EL-P]
And how he changed and took the pain
When he ran into "Fuck You Too"

[EL-P]
Hey yo peel the fuck out
Pop the clutch, weave through the traffic, backwards once
Straight from the wastelands, modern luck
Tainted, baked in hate and hot sun
It ain't the same when I murk the certain
Bump the whip trunk, alert: trucks swervin'
We play the game like bitch curtains
And Ace in a hole like..

[Aceyalone]
You talk nervous!
My mind is filled with a thousand kills
When no-good MC's come face these skills
Pop the peel, bug the fuck out, brake the fuck out
When I grab that steel
The neutralizer, the equalizer, meet the heat miser
Burn your high riser
Roof's on fire and so is the first floor
Keep sticking you, till it don't hurt no more

[EL-P]
I've seen modern thugs with a virtual headset
Program martyrdom for those who ain't dead yet
And yet dead vets turn and earn bed rest
Sick of how murdering men became trend set

[Aceyalone]
Nuts and bolts, programs and gears
And shots and targets when hands get clear
Try to play brave from a bottle of beer
But you can't play hero if your cape says "Fear"

[Aceyalone and EL-P]
[EL-P:Man]Fuck you too!
[EL-P:Fuck]Man, fuck you too!
[EL-P:Come on!] Fuck you too! [EL-P:Come on!]
[El-P:Matter fact] Fuck your whole crew!

[EL-P]
Welcome to the circus of stars
Sit down! My reach collapse rats, fractured clown!
I was wild with a style before your recording
And smiling to hell with born from pure mourning
In the morning, it's napalm glory
The city's on fire but I can't stop warming
Sick with the vision of bliss and wild burners
Stick with admission I'll split you lips
Warning!

[Aceyalone]
They wanna jump into the battle and earn their respect
Well get the fuck up! Let me cash this check
I'm still on deck with a mouth full of poison
Spitting at you and your crew and your boys and
Rain on parades, leave stains on the blade
I came with the raid and I'm leaving with your head
I walk home alone from the terror dome
FULL! Because hungry wolves need to be fed

[EL-P]
Yo, I punch throats and punch the clock
(There's) sharks in the moat and landsharks with Glocks
(Where) cops and kids bust shots not to live
Bitch shut your barf box and talk to the fist

[Aceyalone]
Marksmanship and the parts don't slip
You marks get lit up and hit up so quick
It's dark in the pit you betta watch what you do
Fuck you motherfucker!

[EL-P and Aceyalone]
Fuck you too!
