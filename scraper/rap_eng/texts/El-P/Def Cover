[Verse 1: Murs]
Creep with me while I crawl through the hood
Maniac lyricist, just call me Murs, that's good
You'll get crushed when I bust on beats
And you'll never hear me holla bullshit for the streets
I'm not anti-white, or anti-nigga, just anti-ignorant and anti-idiot
El-P make the beat and ain't I killin it?
Don't care who you are, if I ain't feelin it
I'm tellin your ass
Fuck you and these labels that be selling that trash
And these underground artists with their sales gone bad
Fuck with me I'll do it Sugafree
And send you to the corner just to get my cash
I'll whoop that ass
Put that on your momma
And get ready for the action cause I don't bring drama
I'm a tell the world you're wack
In every interview
Plus your squad's kinda pale
You need some color in your crew
Bought your first rap tape way back in '92
You had Slaughter, Warren, Slayer, and Firehouse
Thought this rap thing is cool, hey I might try it out
There's only do and do not
There is no try
It's in the Midichlorian for true Jedi
You was scared to come to shows cause they let the lead fly
Now you have no heart, no soul, no funk
And it's 187 on you underground punks

[Hook: Samples]
"Do you like it?"
"I can give a fuck how you feelin'"
"Feel this"
"Bitch feel this"

[Verse 2: Murs]
I was bumping Nocturnal when my mind started to travel
On how I used to seek out MCs for raps to unravel
Now you think I can't battle rap
Cause I roll a Cadillac
Put your money where your pie-hole is and watch me fuck you
Watch your cash like my name was Jason Biggs
I'm making kids wanna grow up to be astronauts again
Cause they see being an MC is not an option when
There's a hungry motherfucker like me lookin for fresh meat
To make 'em look foolish as hell over their best beat
I press heat to your ear like gauze to a wound
Hoping that it goes platinum like them Cosby cartoons
If I don't get a plaque on my wall from platinum release
I'll still be a classic to y'all with plaque on my teeth
Chain smoking, brain choking the shit outta rappers
I had to end your beginning to start the next chapter
Now I'm on some other shit like that [?] that common wears
Or the Enron affair or Andr√©'s hair
Somebody else might, but I just don't care
What you say, or where your from
I'm the baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums
Such a sick tongue, I should be an [IC?]
Have to wear this long beard to hide the IV
My goal since I was young: be a fly MC
So I jumped off the gym junior high PE
Fell flat on my face, everyone laughed at me
Now my flow's so strong gravity defies me
And I float on air without a pair of Nikes
So you just can't compare to flows rare like these

[Hook]
