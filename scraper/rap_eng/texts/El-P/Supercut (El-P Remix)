[Intro: Lorde]
In my
Supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of, supercut of, supercut of us

[Verse 1: Lorde]
In my head, I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head, the visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you, there's just a supercut

[Chorus: Lorde]
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the supercut of us
We keep tryna talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watchin' our love
In your car, the supercut of, supercut of

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
We is the villains, and there ain't no chillin'
Get body bags and the toe tags, yeah
Scoundrels in housin', we tore through your town
And we reload it and now we back, man
Forgiato rollin' on a '96 Impala
With a pretty thing, show me where I'm slayin'
I ain't playin' with you lames
700 horse in the Hellcat
Take ya bitch, where ya at?

[Verse 3: El-P]
Dirty, all-black Jeep, 2018
With the clean rhyme rappers on deck, check
Came with the bad bars, bully with the big box
Shush when the runners on set
G-G-Give it up, you don't got a bit of luck left
Nah, not even a itty bit of fresh (Good lord)
Fall on your sword for the crime abhorrent
That's your reward for the mindless whorin'

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
This for everybody that hated
Michael and Jamie, we made it
Every debt due, we paid it
My cadence is heinous
You keep tryna play us, and you gon' be famous
And just like the top on my '75 drop
I'm just hittin' a button and you gon' be brainless
And that's from the back of a 'lac where I'm smokin' the sack
Wit' my girl, watchin' seasons of Shameless

[Verse 5: El-P]
There's no manual, Run The Jewels publish shit annual
Every minute I'm in it, I'm runnin' a clinic
Wild animal, livin' like a Fine Young Cannibal
Citizen of cynics, admit it, the kid get it
Earth's a hot block, the pot get chop chopped
You walk and watch blocks my heart should pop off
The hot rocks shooters will knock your whole op off
That's why I don't got tocks on the clock to rock soft

[Verse 6: Lorde]
So I fall into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it to just a su-

[Chorus: Lorde]
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of, supercut of, super, super
