[Verse 1]
It ain't as good as it gets
If you got holes all over your chest
My best day is your worst day
"Worst day" is my best phrase
That's just what I get
Rope squeezing my neck
Things I'll forget
Lost in my hotel room
Ocean on it's way back soon
That's what we get
Flies licking my face
All bets are closed off in this race
Break ground, start again
Break ground, start again
Get what we can get
Poison on my plate
I love it all the same
There's hands on my wrist in the form of a fist
In the form of a kiss
Light up, light up the sky

[Verse 2]
Showing off your bed
Showing up and get dead
Cut open the clone who's wearing all my clothes
Well that's just what I get
It ain't as good as it gets
If you got holes all over your head
Window on my table, windows in the rearview
And in the palm of my hand in the form of a fist

[Hook]
Leave some room
For the lucky ones
Seal our tomb
With gifts and gold and brass and bone
Leave some doom
For the lucky ones
Seal our tomb
With gifts and gold

Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky

Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky

Leave some room
For the lucky ones
Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Doom
For the lucky ones
