[Intro: Etta James]
Wild hungry arms
Wild hungry arms
You give me all the love I need

[Verse 1: Andrew Wyatt]
Girl, you say you want it
And I have no trips about it
And these played-out faces around me
Want you to know where they go
But they ain't got nothing on you
To say I'd open your mouth for me
I've got you locked down like police
And no three-to-five, you're doing life, so

[Chorus: Andrew Wyatt]
Please don't knock over my heart
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
I don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Country girl meets city slicker, former stripper tipper
Her mama says that she should kick it with a better ninja
Her daddy hates on Run The Jewels and don't like Michael Render
Monogamy ain't even promised if we add a member
I'll stay faithful from November on to next December
No average marriage but your life'll be such an adventure
Iced out in Iceland in the blue lagoon, dead of the winter
Stop listenin' to your loser family, come fuck with a winner

[Verse 3: El-P]
I'm from a city where havin' a heart is not suggested
I'm a maverick at tappin' backs, I'm a savage inventor
I'm cleanin' braces with tongue and vac and a bag of dentures
Even a bearskin rug in a livin' room could get it
Don't be mad at me, I'm just jokin' to grab some attention
But really fact of the matter, I'll cut a pinky off
And slide it 'cross the table just to get into the room that you undress in
I'll fight a fuckin' wookie just to bend it

[Chorus: Andrew Wyatt]
Please don't knock over my heart
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
I don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you

[Interlude: Etta James]
Wild hungry arms
Wild hungry arms
You give me all the love I need

[Bridge: Andrew Wyatt]
After a while I fanned the fire
Then I knew that you were wild
I think that the time is now
I think that the time is now, so

[Chorus: Wyatt]
Please don't knock over my heart
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
I don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
