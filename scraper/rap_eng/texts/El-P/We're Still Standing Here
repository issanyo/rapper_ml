[Intro]
'Cause everything is okay
Man, it's more than okay, it's fantastic
It's okay
It's more than okay, it's fantastic
It's okay
It's more than okay, it's fantastic

[Verse 1]
You sunk your skrill in perforated morality
Well, have a cast, it stands right now
It looks like terminated circuits in a playground
Of future imperfect aftermath
After grapple pits and hell winds pour

It's alligator brain (flush me)
Walk into the holographic, hella Frank Gifford
Pitch one penny, definitely dusty
Both intoxicated and lovely (real lovely)

Hover above that magic black art tragedy work
Turk of the middle-land, citizen, little man
El Product cenobite classic, let a tight at it
Grope into the folds of rows of young sirens

Better be a liver wire, the people want violence
I define in one spit, that shit's on berserker flow
Nurtured on badger milk, wrapped in silk; work with those
This little piggy runs bent as a rat gate

Pulling on my unicorn, fucking up at the factory
The supervisor doctored an acceptable explanation
The God of Kublai, El's tryna haggle about what I'm paying him
If this seems irate, come touch the calm liquid

Tested for ADD for turning into a phoenix
Now dreams float slow through the soluble hemoglobin
Conflicted like Moses, between guns and roses
Either path chosen, the opposite has its moments

Some will open doors to the prophesies of neurosis
I laugh at the shattered cats tryna evade my reality
Suggestions about life from an insecure personality
I'm not blind, I just find my paradigm different
Maybe you should examine the mantra "suck the piston" â€“ listen

[Verse 2]
(One one one one one one one one)
Wanted me, though greeted me quick, he's sick too
When he rubs the circuitry between decks two and one
It's neuromancer, your teen idol slasher
Petrified of liars and testicular cancer

But good liars aren't removable, they're sold into their craft-slash-work
Better buy a bed man
Drove a class wild hunting through logic, sit and time it
(Yo yo) My Weather Men mongoloids stay Frederick

Harness absolute vernacular, tapping our modern weapons
Barks, creatures, and cannibals quickly crawl out the woodwork
It's good worth giving, considered to stop philanthropy
Welcome to the planet of garbage, join the harvest

Notified believers are left to sit through the carnage
Some battle existence and clipped wings on pigeons
Listening to nothing and thinking it made a difference
Pay me for that hamburger now, son (fuck Tuesday)

This is the new definition of business, get with it
It's unos at six, all for no particular interests
I'm a grown man, with grown snafus and moments
Hardly had a chance to relax from bad omens
The damage is fantastic, automatic, it's rapture
I tipped her with a pant, and it's pink and catch donuts

[bridge]
It's like that
Everything might fade away
But we're still standing here (I want y'all to know)
We're still standing here (I want y'all to know)
We're still standing here (I want y'all to know)
We're here

[Verse 3]
You misinterpreted that Funcrush shit
So man, funcrush this
Spectacular dawning of the heard thinner faction where distraction is bliss
Tyrell took a sabbatical but back for the new semester (rocking that)
Class action suit from the Laundromat of velour and pressed polyester
American history exo-bytes cypher with the tainted offspring, gimme NoDoz quick
You need to haul that mega-dumb style to the antique roadshow, bitch
The system bleeds for the radio angry, rock that wound aesthetic
The name of this routine is live at man you just don't get it
Please try to compartmentalize my dick
With a little bit a that bitch hubris
When the Ritalin starts to fade I might get lucid
Every mindfuck I handout comes with a free month of internet access
And an updated year 2003 version of the mega clapper (you know the drill, clap off)
This is the third installment of a prequel that was never written right
Filmed with that classic Brooklyn magic, without LucasArts graphics
Rendered cuddly comic relief creatures or terrible child actors
Get off that jade elephant, you're stoned, and remember everything backwards

[Outro]
It's like that
Everything might fade away
But we're still standing here (I want y'all to know)
We're still standing here (I want y'all to know)
We're still standing here (I want y'all to know)
We're here
