[Emcee(s): C-Rayz Walz]
[Producer(s): El-P]
[Sample: [?] - “[?]”]

[Hook 1: Sample: [?] - “[?]”] (x2)
Living in a paradise
You’re living in a paradise

[Bridge 1 (Overlapped with Hook 1): C-Rayz Walz]
I command you to riot and overthrow your
Mind

[Hook 1 (Overlapped with Hook 2): Sample: [?] - “[?]”] (x4)
Living in a paradise
You’re living in a paradise

[Hook 2 (Overlapped with Hook 1): C-Rayz Walz] (x4)
Keep it
Moving.  You could hold it down when you
Know and control the sounds

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I’m the
American Dream in action, the veterans of steam
The fractioned piece of forbidden holiness recaptured
Watch news columns combine, blow your mind at nine.  Read
The signs, or should I say this forty-one times?  Rush
The floors.  Dope before?  You can’t get out the train and y’all
Can’t out the box.  Yo, get in.  You train.  Do not
Hold doors, do not lean on walls/Walz, do not
Pee on floors.  This is beyond war.  We are
Peon pawns, Red-neon Dawns.  Watch
The Bushes—Patriot games get prolonged.  Snakes
Super-sperming, aim, shoot the vermin.  Ch-ch-
-ch-ch.  Is it burning?  Well, see, now you’re learning.  And don’t
Think that your gun could protect your girl.  This is
New York Hell.  This affects the world.  Para-
-dise, green grass, meditation, calm breeze, fresh
Fruits, veggies, clean mountain valley streams.  I mean
Checkers are chess, truth is the square root of life
Proof is the beats eats when reality bites.  Pan-
-dora’s Box, Radio Raheem's battery charged.  I'll Lean
Back like Pisa to the dark side of the dart.  The speech
Is salt—it sucks hearing leeches talk.  Think it’s
The force?  We in Mordor—police is the orcs.  Walking
Cerebus with the Raising Hell t-shirt.  Crackheads
Get locked up for stem cell research

Living in a paradise
You’re living in a paradise

[Bridge 2 (Overlapped with Hook 1): C-Rayz Walz]
You’re in-
-volved with something beyond your comprehension
The real millennium X-Files, daily conditions

[Hook 1: Sample: [?] - “[?]”] (x2)
Living in a paradise
You’re living in a paradise

[Bridge 3 (Overlapped with Hook 1): C-Rayz Walz]
Secret missions caught in the middle of conspiracy and
Espionage.  Go against all odds

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Paradise.  My pupils travel like the old priest, and I’m told
We need bullet holes like police need more heat (We’re living in)
Paradise.  Psalms in your palm like a pair of dice
You could peep Christ if you pay the passion of the price (To get in)
Paradise.  Perhaps, through perception, you’ll get a percentage of
Power prophesized in points of progression (Within)
Paradise.  Don’t plagiarize, premeditate your position
Fuck props, prosecute Pulp Fiction.  Perse-
-cuted poison from the pulpit proving the
Rich lie.  The poor procrastinate, die, and make excuses
Prophets past prime pick pockets and
Practice pointing pistols at feces with plans to pop shit (This paradox)
Give you the poetic premonitions of Pac
Preaching to P.O.W.s in prison with props (Paradise)
Take it back to the block when creativity was god
Everybody wasn’t chasing the dollars, scared of jihad (The paradox)
It ain’t the church, the mosque, zen, or the temple or shrine
Cathedral or the synagogue—nah.  It’s just
The one sentiment that’s in us all: hate.  Confu-
-sion an act of being unaware and stuck in the fog, but this ain’t
Mission from Mars.  This more like Walz spitting these
Bars to ensure my position tomorrow.  Digital
Bible rap prophecy, watchtower mockery.  I mean
Your mind’s been molested sloppily.  I got a
Bomb in my beeper, a laser in my sneaker
Radiation reapers, students kidnap the teachers, but there’s
Cameras in the bleachers, police dogs with six heads
Twelve grenades in my dozen of eggs.  Trying
To stop the plague before it spreads, striving not
To fall off ‘cause I know I know I Know the Ledge.  Allegiance
To my soldiers what I truly pledge.  Like babies after
Six bottles, with this, I’m truly fed.  I checked
The weather: the forecast is pollution.  My reso-
-lution—(What?)—some radiation suit shit.  They’re intro-
-ducing teen execution by the Constitution
Confusion’s the illusion, so I think straight
Whether using my hood to duck toxic waste, I got this
Case but I ain’t trying to see the judge.  I got this
Wound.  I feel the heat but I ain’t trying to see the blood.  Still got this
Heart but I ain’t fitting to bleed love.  I see the
Plug but I can’t pull that shit out (And you)
(Know who control the sound).  (Can’t get out) Too much ex-
-cuses.  They’re bringing back the nooses.  With no
Strings attached, chemical-drug-abusing pass crack
Using NASDAQ to kill black, brown, yellow, and white
The A-Alike fight vs. Illuminite might.  Para-
-dise.  Seeing buildings crumble, the Towers
Babel, manifest the meaning in the mumbles
