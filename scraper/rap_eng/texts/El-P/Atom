(Atoms fam)

[Vast Aire]
Yo, I ain't superstitious but these niggas is nice

[Alaska]
A lot of cats pop shit, I pop apocalypse
Topple propaganda force fed to the populace
My thoughts run the gamut from outstanding to preposterous
On top of this I move posteriors
From impoverished to posh areas
My process: accomplish through perseverance
Every man's not my brother regardless of appearance
Apprehension clouds the spirit
Tension prepares us for ascension
Man at his best is when he breaks chains or conventions
A convenient covenant coveted for conception
We're all from the same mold: spores and bacteria
Told we're inferior, others ignore hysteria
A claustrophobic neurosis
In this masquerade ball of fake glasses and big noses
Alaska splashes explosive flows
To expose Pinnochio's growing nose
Composed of compost compositions
Those clothes are getting a little close fitting
I'll stomp this shit, add a over confident
Script's compliments of my frozen mic dominance
A passively aggressive testament that's how I'm repping shit

[Vast Aire]
Watch Vast murder the track effortless
Like God's on my side and he answered my Christmas list
After the first couple of bars I start to smell fear
That's when I take them there so they can breathe air
You're so secure with your insecurity
Perfect world of piety I swat flies when they bother me
Some say I touch hearts like Kano
Now every time you see a mic you just say no
Some write with words, I write with metal
That's my soul is rust free, raps stay dusty
In the coldest winters we thought husky
They be like, "I don't know his name but he aim like Wayne Gretzky"
That's funny, cause I don't play hockey
I play horse on the mic and watch them all copy
Left hooks left them shook like etch-a-sketch
Give me an inch with mine
I'll take a mile if you let me
I'm not a bum, I'm a nomad, off dome
Thoughts have no home, the page is ours to roam
Cats be on some fantasy shit like Cinderella
Well we'll see if the shoe fits after the accapella
Never made sense claiming something you wasn't
What's the penalty for that? He might never come back
And the atomic pressure won't lessen
After you've learned your lesson
? a track? Yeah that's a buck fifty
Like a farmhand cutting a little piggie
If I'm the author I'm also the farmer stupid
I shoot a arrow at you and my name ain't Cupid

[Cryptic One]
Yo I'm honest with this art
With a William Wallace heart and it's brave
And a blade that's well polished and sharp
Intent ain't to reinvent the spinning wheels of time
Just to enjoy the bumpy rides and improve upon its design
I take time, every plate circle's complete, love it
I've learned even tardy birds come to eat from it
Early bird gets the worm but the early worm finds a spot
In early bird's stomach and can't escape from it
Idiot box jocks are live stock
Graze amongst our mind crops
Beast of burden, murdered, their mind squashed
Primate nations leave these regions unexplored
Liberty torch protrudes through sandy floors on beach shores
Tour the atomic wastelands, desolate
Definite situations of complex Oedipus
Mother nature broken, fucked by offspring's reckless negligence
Destructive corrupted residence of earthly bound pessimists
Found willingly bound in the back of yellow cabs confessing it clearly
Fear the anti-Mobius Strip theories
Dennis Leary, Miller, and Menace cynicism visions
With a depressed Beth Gibbons position on life's mission

[Vordul Megalah]
Now listen, how sick is these niggas?
Atoms the illest, cap peelers
And don't tote guns, smoke onions
Crying with no funds no fun trying
To get by but we still do it and rep music
'Til death do us wet your noodle
With raps in the pot hard boil the rap gargoyles
Stoned at night on top of buildings Gothic
Like Bruce in the blue suit let's get it popping
Watch it drop out of the sky in the rotten
Apple, where some get tackled
Hooks that grapple right on your Adam
Got you choking off the rhyme potents
Stay focused while you villains stay joking
We serious on the mic get ignorant
Delivering rap vocals for the new millennium
We're from Harlem marching in atomic garments
Bombing all the nonsense
Yo, you cats ain't ready for this, heavy abyss
Thoughts that travel through the tunnels of crypts
My mic holds one in the clip and fours packed under the dick
Spit rhino acapells gun in your shit
Get rap plug's stuck in your whips fucking with this
Over these El-Pro percussion hits
We love to rip, love to sip, love to rep Jux to Def
Yeah, Atoms
