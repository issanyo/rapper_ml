[Intro 1: sample]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know. Yesterday I was down at Fulton mall, these kids trying to step to me like Def Jux wasn't doing it. I'm like, "Dawg, for one, why you stepping up to me like that? You don't even know who I am." You know, with things like... they were on some stuff like talking about El thinks he's the man, he thinks that, you know… but this dude's a straight asshole. The dude can be an asshole, he's doing his thing: he's trying to be ill. But you know, I was trying to pick my sneaks out anyway, and these kids try to step back up to me, I'm like "Dude, I'm picking out my sneakers; trying to pick out the colors or something.". And they just keep walking up, just keep saying this stuff to me. So I'm like "Yo, yo, if y'all don't back up off of me right now, yo, I promise to God, I'm like to flip my wig, straight up (straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up)

[Intro 2]
Hoobity blah blah, talking all hard
You are now listening to the sounds of the weareallgoingtoburninhellmegamixx2

[Verse 1]
This is not a concept, it's a headache with moving pictures
For the hopeless droids poised on the brink of "Fuck you, mister"
Settle down skipper, that's so September 10th of you
I've been posting up pyrotechnics in this game just like the rest of you

Doesn't explain the fanny pack of detonators
And the remote-control coyote
And a t-shirt that reads "Blow me"
And a sign on my hotel room door that says "Bitch, you don't know me
Do not enter, do not stand here, do not repeat what you have seen here"

Brittle ghosts of perjury slur, I'm right here
Spit on the surgery words
Dirtily gurgling murderin' terms
Further than fucked up
We're posted at evacuation routes
Where we're serving 'em hurt burgers

The method is nervous
This section is to be built impervious
Stumblin' in the back door wrapped in tourniquets
The Weathermen applaud for the droid bots in the art
It's so nice to see a mongoloid savant doing his job

And I tip my dome right to him
But the face was slowly loosening
Too proud to face my fifes on the floor, folk get used to it
You're talking to a slut with a millennial strut
Who biannually cuts the pie chart in his favor just enough

The Aslan damage, a man who's been fan damaged
The arrogant ass, I'm often off
I go by, stumble the fly toner
Rumble the Bumblebee kid
Fade into Starscream being rattled

I'm more than just confused, I'm an asshole
So when you see the human snot box re-organizer, wave your little tassels
And get it popping like epileptics on bubble wrap, you fucking feathers
I'm an everlasting gobstopper – suck me forever

[Bridge]
They keep
They keep
Doin' it
Doin' it
Doin' it

[Verse 2]
I'm lavish in the fabric of automatic a badass shit
Captured the match to the kick
When the snare hits, "Oh shit"
All of a singular sudden a muddy wanderer of bludgeoning fuckery
Stuck in my head is ready to spit

Get back mother fuckers, I got the blood of legends
Pumping in flesh appendages – it's the heaviest shit
I'm dusted, I'll funk cover the bust shit you're dumping on our town
Surround tough love with a free jack back and black lung, bitch

Dumb in love, the animal funk lust, the cannibal dumbstruck
The whore Hannibal trumpeteer with a funk strut
Goodie the hoodlum, bitch in the back of your noodle pudding
My crew is juvenile, mushing pussy breaks
Stupidly moving in breakneck

The great threat, the ultimate thrill, the journey, the death march
You munchkins, you gurney riders, you ought to grab
In the lab, laughable bag babies sucking shit
I'm loving it (I'm loving it, I'm loving it, I'm loving it, I'm loving it)

[Outro]
They keep
They keep
Doin' it
Doin' it
Doin' it
