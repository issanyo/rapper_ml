(Andrew)
Yoooo C, what's up, man?
(Son Anthony)
What’s going on, Drew? How are you?
(Andrew)
I'm good, man. I heard you're in the midst of a tape here
(Son Anthony)
Yeah! I’m almost done. You know I've been writing and rapping so long I'm kinda getting tired. I need a break
(Andrew)
Word word! I'll take it off your hands for a little bit. I got some raps I could spit for ya
(Son Anthony)
Oh, really?
(Andrew)
Yeah, here's one right now
(Son Anthony)
Alright man, go for it

[Verse 1]
I got the mic now. Could you give me air time?
I push it back like LeBron James hairline
Tokyo Airline. Sitting in business
I stay the freshest while your ask who is this
Yup, a sick pup with means to opinionate
You listen to me rap and proceed to insinuate
Huh, you ain't got more styles than me
I sink a half court shot from 180 degrees. Please
You see me and you think it's a game
But don't step to a lion just to tug on its mane
Cos it’s only one bite then you’re bound to get mauled
Like those food court samples that you find at the mall
I'm on the ball like Adidas logos. Style is loco
It’s Overkill, kids, and this tracks a solo
Scratch Bonzo, it's bedtime for bozo's
It's like ’Man vs. Monkey' with you brainless mo-mos

[Hook]
Yeah, look to the sky and watch all the stars just fade to black
Cancel your plans and heed our demands. AVALANCHE is back
See we fear no man and all our plans are void of flaws
So please don't trip and walk straight up and avoid the falls
AVALANCHE CREW, AVALANCHE, AVALANCHE CREW x4

[Spoken]
It's AVALANCHE crew, man
Ha. Since, 08,07. Been holding it down, man
AC and me
Here's a little advice for you..

[Verse 2]
Abandon stealth because my senses are heightened
To reach a dead end in a bed with a ciphon
And if you try and struggle then my grip just tightens
The treatment for those who trespass and trifle with
The boy Drew and the style I wield
Extrapalates the greatness like a cythe on a field
To harvest the inner artist and proceed to reviel
The lyrical blood bath that is half the appeal
Yo, you're 14 and your life is a bummer
Because you dyed your hair pink and you live on Tumblr
And my ears are pretty good but I don't hear your complaints
Cos I'm happy hustling, going hard in the paint
Nothing to move with when you use excuses
It's like a voyage with a whole in the sails
Handicap yourself, now you're labeled a doofus
And go viral like an epic fail
I've seen enough memes, they no longer amuse
Get your eyes off the screen and away from the news
It's an honest way to propogate what's truly untrue
See, the media don't care what's beneficial to you
Just flush out those thoughts like the bowl you piss in
And stack that paper like Dunder Mifflin
Some people gonna say that you're acting different
But stick to the facts, Little Mac, you're gifted

[Hook]
Yeah, look to the sky and watch all the stars just fade to black
Cancel your plans and heed our demands. AVALANCHE is back
See we fear no man and all our plans are void of flaws
So please don't trip and walk straight up and avoid the falls
AVALANCHE CREW, AVALANCHE, AVALANCHE CREW x4
