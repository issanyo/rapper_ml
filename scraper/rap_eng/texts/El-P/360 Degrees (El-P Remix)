[Mr. Lif]
Yo
The plans' covered in asphalt
The Lord told me that its man's fault
For perpetuating detrimental ways of living we can't halt
Everything inside ya move
You're caught inside a homicidal groove
Where only the idle loose
By violating one of life's most vital rules
Thou shalt not
But hell is a foul spot, where many are misinformed when they are taught
And thus cherish the untrue
Then die for the lies that they clung to
Del and I were there when they hung you
And as you swung to and fro
We asked, (where did the humane humans go?)
With none in sight
We're left to focus on the same stunning fight
That spites the same force that put the sun in flight
So I summon night
The lack of light left some in fright
And living in fear
With something they couldn't bear
I promise to tell the truth and the whole truth
I solemnly swear

[Chorus 3x]
Left
Right
Up
Down
Diagonal
Three-hundred and sixty degrees

[Del the Funky Homosapien]
Progression, the lesson
I figure out which direction, then jettison
Minimalize perplexion
Flesh and bone, that's just a physical
I got a spiritual
Awareness, I have risen to
Its not mystical, something that I listen to
When these plastic motherfuckers try to get in-to
My cypher, I ciphen they blood like they split in two
Yeah, Del, repel, arduous
The purest, give 'em service
With no insurance
Evil
I see through, like cellophane
Knowledge of self, that's why people see Del is strange
They wanna humanize the most demonic dudes
Apply harmonic rules
Decide, who is the guy
Americas'
Just like a pair of glove
Don't want to share with us
Anarchy, tear it up

[Chorus 3x]

[Mr. Lif then Del alternating stanzas]
The new era, brings terror
You wish the quality of life was better
Peep the dilemma

Yeah life's getting dimmer
Stomachs' gettin' thinner
But your souls keep you full, obesity is for sinners

The sentiment lingers
Low self-esteem hinders

I tell my people 'bout slavery, no one remembers

Maybe they ought to take a look in they mirrors

Like Michael Jackson, and they actions gettin' clearer

Beware, the imagery might scare ya

If you ain't close to the source, then you don't like prosperity

One or many waitin' in line for therapy

But everyone bear a seed
Pure as the air we breathe

[Chorus 3x]
