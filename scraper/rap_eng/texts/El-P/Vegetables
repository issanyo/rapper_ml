Verse 1

Shit got pretty weird real quick
Heard that you rep that kit/ but I bet that hits like a bee with no sting
Weed that we rolling, got us holy
Release the kraken/ who would've thought it'd be me to bring rap back in
And be the baddest, head dressed up so you know Im savage
And told that bad bitch/ to go and find me a real woman
Gold dig by me, you feel nothing, find nothing
Im poor as fuck windows boarded up with no touring bus
And they ignoring us, but i bet they hearing everything Im saying right now
Kill it every time I ryhme and write down/ find the right sound, devine the light shine
Fuck a supervillain I came to fight crime/ insane I might try
Reaching  in to pull out the minds eye
We in the deep end, you on the kids side
Catch you on the flipside Ima bout to be like
The re write of jesus
Need a verse well you gotta pay loot
I bet I made you, when I came through
Did a little show and flip a bit of flow
Im the father I bet I raised dudes/
The rawest product, you know I produce
The flawless honest, not a novice
Got it locked in, stop for the goddess
Ima be the oddest ever rap artist
Never thought it real till they heard it recorded
Kinda been dormant/ now Im in a mode of motivating
Hold up i was waiting, I been really patient
Now I go ape shit/ you be on the fake shit
Turn rappers into medical patients
Gurneys for the actors who get wasted
Off the weed shoelaced it
Not me Im too taded
I be the new agent/

Hookandshit

I feel like l feel like getting high

Verse2

Flip flows off and on like a light switch, ya girl like this
I might just, try to ignite, instead of picking a fight
And get another delight, I know it's nothing but addictions baby
Punks and, all the snitches crazy
Stuck in, this horrendous way see, fendi ratings instagrams
Kick  the can and jump over the bucket
Focus and fuck shit, up
Hopefully bust, a couple of records
You tryin get hurt, Im dyin to get her
Back to the crib/ and get up in the gut
Thats how we live we say we don't give a fuck
Act up a bit, rap is accurate
Never drank activis, and after this sticker slap a bitch
You too drunk you could pass the 5th
You too high buddy pass the spliff
I never act a bish, you pretty average
I bet he had to get a little practice in
If it feel electric word to management
And if you feel like steppin
You burn in banishment
