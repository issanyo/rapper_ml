[Twinn Zeus 2012]

I’m tired of killing for people that would never die for me
Bleeding away slowly in this stall tell her goodbye for me
My story, is irrelevant and out shone by the next man’s gory, allegory
So I’ll wait for the locust and the plague
While I’m heckling the devil, initiating trade
Starting with the monkey’s on my back and the dark circles under my shades
Or the worth of my soul and the puddle that I have made
These hands that have held hearts rip them apart and thrown them away
I wish I could blame it on a fit of rage
But my actions feel normal and the excitement always fades
Down drains with the sins I thought I rid myself of in my glory days
They have to pool up somewhere
Who knew it would be in my heart but I don’t think that’s fair
I must eviscerate this circuitry instead I repair
A thousand broken mirrors reflect cold stares
Your heart is so important I bet you’d kill for it
In order to fill your belly you need to fill more clips
We've produced more shells than there are in the sea
But you can’t shoot bullets at the shell of a man you’ll grow to see
He’s pushing a baby carriage roaming free
Dogs bare fangs; fake smiles show teeth

Listening to the echoes of your voice travel down the barrel of a gun
Keep balm for lips
Ready to detonate and spit
Lyrics so swift that they take any hit and still run

I am a controller
Cordless next to my mahogany degree holder
Hand folder, toy soldier
A holographic representation of the border
A battery free solar charger
Collegiate wasted language destructive trench mortar
Cherish anguish with the mentality of a hoarder
The devil pays me royalties for every crashed charter
I’d spit harder if I had a straight smiled Ali Larter
That I could use to barter
For a better set of circumstances, make an expert out of a starter
Novice anti thesis of sean carter
N man’s man a martyr’s martyr
Wind extinguishes candles and fans flames
Looking for a beggar to blame
For the conscious efforts made to remain under the line and play the governments game
Worried about getting paid, when you can’t take it to the grave
But you’ll trust it to the bank, over the hand of a stranger
Those greedy palms must be safer
And protect you from the danger
That these haters form
But I must be stating the obvious because it seems like the norm
Wouldn't walk a mile in your shoes because they’re worn
From running this corrupt system from which I was born
It’s everywhere this stench won’t leave
Clouds my visions claws at my throat I can’t breathe
Born to die but we die to be born to reach nirvana, right
Eternal happiness can only be found in the afterlife
Until death binds me forever to this sense of right
And the last pocket of air escapes my lungs and takes flight
Shooting towards the exosphere in the middle of the night
Reaches a proper height and warns the angels of my plight
He’s coming… quick everyone hide
So we can catch him off guard and attack while he’s surprised
Aim for his groin, his heart, his eyes
But don’t quit attacking he is proficient with knives
And has the ability to create any weapon with his lines
Tap out Morse code young Gregory Hines
While you’re catching more z’s than bee’s rhymes
I’m connecting golden hexagons like a bee hive
Press rewind
Attach claymores to the weak points that I find
Accumulating artillery until the spirit of Atilla the Hun
Carrying two golden guns fills me
Octo-mic crusher call me killer bee
Stump the Riddler literally
Hack saw jaw with two griddles for grilled cheese sizzling
On my grind like two women scissoring
Burn open wounds with industrial grade Listerine
Channel chakra in my hands until my fingers start blistering
Perforated your body with holes
So when the wind blows
I can here you whistling
