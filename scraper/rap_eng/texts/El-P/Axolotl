[Verse]
I'm glowing bright, obsidian
Axolotl amphibian
Un-elemental chemical
Got me growing six black tentacles
A little nightmarish, a little maudlin
Good golly go get that kid some laudanum
Salvation's more than I can afford
Who needs the Devil when you've got the Lord?

[Chorus]
Oh my soul
Losing control
Who built this heart?
Oh my God

[Verse]
Now sister Maggie's coming in fleet-foot
Baby's got a belly full of black soot
I got the feeling I better just stay put
And she'll love you better than any real man could
An accidental amphibian
I'm growing giddy as a Gideon
Another head for the chopping board
Who needs the Devil when you've got the Lord?

[Chorus]
Oh my soul
Losing control
Who built this heart?
Oh my God
