[Mr. Lif]
Now this is dedicated to that little piece of mind
That you find everyday when you leave your daily grind

[Akrobatik]
The time is 5 PM and now you leavin your cubicle
It's daylight savings time and the weather is beautiful

[Mr. Lif]
Suitable to chill and breathe a sigh of relief
At last the day is yours for you to do as you please

[Akrobatik]
Yeah, you feel the breeze even when the traffic is crammed
Because you on your way home and bumpin your favorite jam

[Mr. Lif]
So you run into your crib and then you lock your door
Zonin out, listenin to records galore

[Akrobatik]
Lookin for some Perceptionists, maybe some Jill Scott
But no matter what you checkin, the selection's real hot (hot ...)

[Mr. Lif]
Here's the plot, give it everything you got
Make moves, then your life will truly improve

[Akrobatik]
Now you thinkin 'bout the hours that you put in for them
And surpassin them for delf, cause that's the real gem (gem)

[Mr. Lif]
Here's an idea, think to yourself "yeah, this is my year"
Now perceive with your mind clear (clear)
All those things you're sayin you would do in the past
Make them daily tasks, so those bright ideas won't last (last)

[Hook]

[Akrobatik]
It's 5 O'clock and I'm finally free

[Mr. Lif]
It's my time to shine, my time to be

[Akrobatik]
I spent the whole damn day workin for you
Now it's time to do somethin for me

[Phonte]
I just can't wait, to get on home
Away from you and be all alone
Turn off the TV and put off the phone
Cause it's 5 O'clock, now everybody sing along
Baba, da baba
Baba, da baba
Baba, da baba
Baba, da baba

[Akrobatik]
Now you understand that you your own woman or man
Because you broke it down to a simple four step plan

[Mr. Lif]
Step 1, sit and make a plan son

[Akrobatik]
Step 2, make time for you, boo

[Mr. Lif]
Step 3

[Both]
TURN OFF YOUR MOTHERFUCKIN TV!

[Akrobatik]
All the sudden, there's so much of the world to see
And step 4 is to explore your options and get it poppin
To get in the game instead of just watchin
Entrepreneurial maneuvers, self investment
That's the shit, I can't contest it

[Mr. Lif]
If you ain't doin what you love doin, your losin
Security's illusion created by institution
To keep us movin to the job, bank and the store
A commonly accepted thus perpetuated war

[Akrobatik]
And if what you waitin for is opportunity to knock at your door
Then step it up, cause it ain't like that no more (more)

[Mr. Lif]
Sure, you can sit at home, rottin away
But in your heart I know you feel there's somethin missin everyday (day)

[Akrobatik]
But all that matters to you now is you off the clock
Yo this weekend's goin to be off the ROCKER son! (yeah son!)

[Hook]

[Akrobatik]
It's 5 O'clock and I'm finally free

[Mr. Lif]
It's my time to shine, my time to be

[Akrobatik] (Phonte)
I spent the whole damn day workin for you
Now it's time to do somethin for me
Now it's time to do somethin for me (baba, da baba)
Now it's time to do somethin for me (baba, da baba)
I done spent the whole damn day workin for you (baba, da baba)
Now it's time to do somethin for me (baba, da baba)

[Phonte]
I just can't wait, to get on home
Away from you and be all alone
Turn off the TV and put off the phone
Cause it's 5 O'clock, now everybody sing along
Baba, da baba
Baba, da baba
Baba, da baba
Cause it's 5 O'clock, now everybody sing along
Baba, da baba (woooooo)
Baba, da baba (sing it again)
Baba, da baba
Cause it's 5 O'clock, now everybody sing along (baba, da baba)
