Am I dreaming? No
Well where am I? In bed?
Well, what am I doing?
Talking to myself
Look, I must have a star on my door
[?]
Swing doors, huh?
OK doors, swing!

Now I know I'm dreaming
How do I get to sleep?
Look at those bars on the window
1, 2, 3, sleep

Please let me sleep
Poetry, thatâ€™ll work:
"Come sweet slumber and shroud me in thy purple cloak"
Doesn't even rhyme

Is that my [?] man?
I can't stand tea

Trust me
