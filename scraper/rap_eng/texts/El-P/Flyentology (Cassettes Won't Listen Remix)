Keep me in the sky, that's all that I cry
I'll become your servant if it's worth your time
Keep me in the sky, that's all that I'll say
I'll become your soldier, at least for this day
Keep me in the sky, that's all that I cry
I'll become your servant if it's worth your time
Keep me in the sky, that's all that I'll say

I know I haven't been walking a humble path
I know I cursed at your name and then laughed
And though I found it inane to bend calf
The servitude of groveling framed as pained task

I gotta figure, it can't hurt to ask
Suspension of disbelief in uniquely freak flash
Admission of the faithfully shaken, now trapped
Thirty thousand and dropping, it's on and popping at last

Keep me in the sky, that's all that I cry
I'll become your servant if it's worth your time
Keep me in the sky, that's all that I'll say
I'll become your soldier, at least for this day

(No!) There are no atheists in the foxholes
(No!) There is no intellect in the air
(No!) There are no scientists on the way down
Just a working example of faith versus physics

Flyentology (oh god)
Everybody get your ticket today
Flyentology (oh god)
Welcome aboard, sir, right this way
Flyentology, flyen-flyentology (oh god)
Our bible is in your seat back pocket
Flyentology (oh god)
Tuck your head between your legs and pray

I adore you
The same way that others always adored you
Emergency, humility, just break glass
I implore you
With no knowledge of dogma to conform to
I know I don't deserve it, but, save my ass

And if I'm going down, let me do it in first class
The paganistic prayer of a heathen with wild past
Please forgive my bastard lifestyle- fast
And anoint me with salvation in the form of non-crash

I wanna live so bad
All my life, I've been so arrogant
This is the vessel of my 'wakening
Please father, put your hand out, carry me

I wanna live so bad
All my life, I've been so arrogant
This is the vessel of my 'wakening
Goddamn it, put your hand out, carry me

Keep me in the sky, and show me how to worship
