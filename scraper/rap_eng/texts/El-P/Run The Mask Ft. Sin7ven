(Chorus)
Run the mask, gun in tact i’mma fucking snap
Bustin and cussin and sting like ah muzen cab
Hard pressed when i bar flex and I’m up in tracks
The car wrecked, ‘cause i’m farfetched,  as a cup of hash

(Verse 1 : Disjointed)
All you hella flockers finna jump from helicopters
Meta mocker, slamming your head a knocked into a metal lockers
Fuck kettle poppers, salty as my well I conjured
Heaven talkers, backed into a corner need some better posture

Rappers sound like eddie murphy getting burpy
Petting furbies, y’all petty turkeys is already girlie
I swear to god it a medical condition
Head is full of writtens that I said in hella full conviction ya

Never kickin it clean, my house is a sickening scene
Frickin obscene, when I cross your wife’s mind she flicking the bean
And I ain’t talking mexican food, you ignorant dweeb
I’m a prick and a fiend, and excellent brute, stricken as me

Pish pash you dishrags kiss ass like all day
Gaining a buzz at a sloth’s pace, get whiplash in a crawl space
What I pack is astounding, got the massivist bounty
I’m rafi with a 9 screaming gattaca loudly, fuck

(Chorus)
Run the mask, gun in tact i’mma fucking snap
Bustin and cussin and sting like ah muzen cab
Hard pressed when i bar flex and I’m up in tracks
The car wrecked, ‘cause i’m farfetched,  as a cup of hash

(Verse 2 : Sin7ven)
Waiting for your posse, backs lit by the crimson sun
I’d mad dog your leader, if you had a convincing one
Black hearted creature Sin who wagging his cinder tongue
At half hearted dreamers, since you banging a finger gun

I suggest you curse the heavens for your twisted fate
Fucking with a crew that’s breathing pestilence and spitting plague
He’s trying to pick from all the expletives within his brain
Eviscerate your vision, mission: exodus from prison chains

Y’all sounding bubblegum and saccharine
I’m running rampant in a cypher cutting tongues and cackling
Boomslang coming with that gutter funk and rappers things
Color, fun and dragon wings, sulfur lung, attacking kings

Cut above Fleet Street a ghost that cracks mirrors
I stand before a red moon holding black scissors
Weave evil plans: death, doom, Goldman Sachs, Twitter
Like that weasel man Ted Cruz, zodiac killer
