[El-P]
Scrams, set the detonators
Yo Cage, we gon wait for your signal
(It's so ridiculous)
Got the blunderbuss? Get it straight into the section
Go straight to the broadcast booth
(It's so ridiculous)
Yo man, don't even worry about that
Hold up, I'll be with you in a second
(It's so ridiculous)
I'm just gonna, uh, take these shrooms real quick

[Camu Tao]
Yo, yo, ayyo
And I see my niggas I'm hollarin, "Where them girls at!?"
They started picturing dollars and get them girls back
Yo, where did they go?

[El-P]
To the VMA show, on the tele, yo
Pirates of the circus city murder show with every flow
To work absurd word nervous
Stumbling pissy shitty liquor's in me dizzy very slow
Bumpin to Kelly O

[Camu Tao]
Oh no
Spit on her back and have Scrams stumble in and spill a drink on her lap
I'm on the main floor with Pink smacking that ass
While Moby's in the rear givin P-Diddy a lap dance
Welcome to the scam, order my dudes up
We're fucking Usher up and piss on seats in his tour bus

[El-P]
C'mon dawg, runnin a muck will waste my lazerface
Before the mushrooms take I'm trying to hear the sound my taser makes
Hop off the bus, rubber ducky, tape clutch
Feelin touched
Waiting for the signal from Cage to rush

[Camu Tao]
We can't rely on that though we smokin dust moon

[El-P]
Please I got the schematics of the building on brain
Bought 'em off disgruntled janitors lookin to make a change
So fame turns to flames tonight, yay

[Camu Tao]
Yo, trying to fuck up the bars, smokin cigars and breaking glasses
These stars thinkin ghetto and starts to change his accent
Yo, yo dawg, Kid Rock thinks he's classic
He's plastic, got a two-way from Vast to whoop his ass kid

[El-P]
Vordul Megallah's actin regular
Trying to distract rappers in back
While we're slip in is as a rabid pack of predators
We won't be credited
Most of the greatest revolutionaries of our day and age are labeled terrorists

[Camu Tao]
Yo, fuck up the lobby
Runnin with shotty's
Slip into the powder room
Rub on Ashanti
And tell her that she turned in buckets of piss
They'll put it in the chain stores and they'll claim it's a hit

[El-P]
Oh, dawg, I think these shrooms just hit
I had schematics memorized but all I'm think about's tits
And for any sick witted, see if you can murk with her kid
And I will place it in a stroller get some milk on my lips

[Camu Tao]
C'mon man, yo stick with the plan
When Guiliani steps on the stage we'll part 'em (pardon) with cannons
When Sheryl Crow starts her squackin we'll beat up her hands
They're trying to brainwash us with keys and video cams

[El-P]
Guiliani? Where? That's Moussilini believe me Mu
This scene's dreamy, dude, Dali'd out
Clocks melted and shit
It's a Fear and Loathing in NY skit
But I'm gonna try and put this scope in his rib and get biz
And plug a dummy in that fascist standing next to that bitch
She shoulda never left Las Vegas, now I'm gunnin for twits
That ho's fourty six singing about she's soakin and shit

[Camu Tao]
God, the psilocybin's takin over this kid
And we need to act fast and take over this shit
Call Yak to slash the tires on all of they whips

[El-P]
My beautiful people, so glad to meet you
You're dressed so nicely
They call me El-Producto all up in your stereo-ereo
Here to greet you
Tao holds the blunderbuss, he'll easily reach you
