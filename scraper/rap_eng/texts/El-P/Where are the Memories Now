I've got to hang on, musn’t fall
Even in the graveyard, there's peace for all
Losing time ain't easy, but if it’s right
Imagination runs wild, showing different light

There have been moments of my dreams
Illusions of success and what it brings
Then I remember the journey down
To this damn hell-house [?]

So where are the memories now
Wake up [?] then fall back to sleep
Leaving madness in memories

Some people call it a fooling thing
But when all is darkness, I cannot bear
To linger with the truth, so I run
Until my memories [?]

So where are the memories now
So where are the memories now
Wake up [?] then fall back to sleep
Leaving madness in memories

Now I've been sometime with no surprise
I'll have to take the chains and open up my eyes
The brightness of the night feels so close
I'll struggle for my bread, I'll feel like a ghost

What am I doing? Who am I?
I've got to find out where my body lies
Am I left to perish on [?] worlds
Along the island to live out this curse?

So where are the memories now
Wake up [?] the fall back to sleep
Leaving madness in memories

You are now listening to the sounds of the weareallgoingtoburninhellmegamix!!!
