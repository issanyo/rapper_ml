[Intro:]

I'm on some shit (shit)...watch what you do (do)...
Who ya do it with (with)...who ya do it to (to)...
I'm on some shit (shit)...watch what you do (do)...
Who ya... (yo...dNA)

[Verse 1:]

Yooo
I don't give a fuck what you think of me
What you think of my life, bitch
What you think about what I think about?
*Chik-chik-a-POW* - takin your life, bitch
Flicker like a lightswitch, oh...
Giving me the evil eye
Watchin me to see if I even try
Big Brother with the eagle eye
CCTV on live, everybody tryna read between my lines
Compromised police read me my rights
See me as guilty 'fore I'm even tried
Now, my big homie, that's Judge Mahoney
She throws me in jail for like nuthin
I guess a break-and-enter ain't nuthin, but still
It ain't like I'm violent, hijacking pilots
You could track the mileage, I'm real (real)
Tryna think what I did to attract the vilest
I'm Baskin-Robbins, I'm chill (chill)
What the fuck's your problem, no fucks to give
Unless you brought a condom I'll fill (fill)
All these first-class citizens
Goin' on about fittin' in
Only thing I care about fittin' in is a Large or XL (L)
I got some shit I wanna run past these fools
And I'm on my peaceful P's and Q's
Until you light up my fuse, so, y'know...
Two-zero-one-oh, moved back for the summer
Lookin' like someone from "Gummo"
A son of a son-of-a-bitch
With a gun in your ribs, you just dunno...
...what up, fuck-o?

[Chorus:]

I'm on some shit, so watch what you do
Who you do it with, who you do it to
Cuz somebody's watchin' on ya (ya)
Yeeah, somebody watchin', and they got
AK's, Kevlar, frag grenades that go BOOM
C4, claymores, no one's bulletproof
No, ain't nobody bulletproof, no
(I'll let a bullet be the proof)

[Verse 2:]

Giving you truth, fact
Matter fact MORE than that, cuz I'm sick of this dumb shit
New Brunswick's got a fungus
Called Miramichi, where I'm from, bitch
And everybody gotta get in my business
All mouth in a small town
Y'all clowns, waitin' for me to fall down
But never knowing whether or not you on my shit-list
And your biscuits'll get burnt
Don't risk it, you'll get learnt
Cuz a muthafucka vicious and he gifted
Take a listen and get turnt
Sean Price took me to Boot Camp
The Game took me to Church
ScHoolboy took me to Hoover Street
And then Ferg took me to Work
(Puttin' in work)
Jerks all in my face
They the ones' got me feelin' so bummy
Job board says "Encorp"
And then John Doran's stealing my money (my money)
And for real, it really ain't funny
Nothing but chamomile in my tummy
Sippin' on camel milk and thinkin' how good a
Ham sam would feel in my belly

[Chorus:] (2x)

I'm on some shit, so watch what you do
Who you do it with, who you do it to
Cuz somebody's watchin' on ya (ya)
Yeeah, somebody watchin', and they got
AK's, Kevlar, frag grenades that go BOOM
C4, claymores, no one's bulletproof
No, ain't nobody bulletproof, no
(I'll let a bullet be the proof)
(Work)
