(CHORUS)
I wanna float...and get lost in the ocean
And ain't nobody gonna stop me from goin
Cuz I'ma hold it wide open...
Yeah, I'm out to get that lau-lau money
That lau-lau money
That lau-lau money, yeah
And I'm fit'n to make it
Loud-loud for ya
Loud-loud for ya
Loud for ya, while I can

(Verse 1)
Made a whole lotta songs
Made a whole lotta beats
Wrote a whole lotta words
On a whole lotta sheets
Didn't make it in Freddy...
I couldn't make it in The 'Chi
Couldn't make it in Hali...
I guess it wasn't meant to be
If it wasn't meant to be, then why can
I spit like this
Like a fuckin machine...?
Why was I not rich off this
By the age 19...?
Cuz I had a good start
And I had a good team...
Everybody knew dNA...
Comin out with me to play
Cuz whatever they seen in themselves
Is what they'd see in me
Maybe they don't need the music...
Maybe they just need to pray
Maybe they just need to lose it
Just need to be insane
For just today...
Maybe they' like me, an' they just need a break

(CHORUS)
I wanna float...and get lost in the ocean
And ain't nobody gonna stop me from goin
Cuz I'ma hold it wide open...
Yeah, I'm out to get that lau-lau money
That lau-lau money
That lau-lau money, yeah
And I'm fit'n to make it
Loud-loud for ya
Loud-loud for ya
Loud for ya, while I can

(Verse 2)
Made a whole lotta friends
Made a whole lotta foes...
Did a whole lotta drugs
At a whole lotta shows...
Met a lot of celebs
And did a whole pile of dope
But that's just how it go...
Yeah, that's just how it go
Can a muthafucka tell me PLEASE
How to get it back (get it back) -
How to bring it back home
To the place I recognize
To the place it belongs
I've been alone, all along
And it's shittiful; pitiful and prolonged
I won't admit I'm a criminal, but I know
That I'm cricket to over-critical trolls
Over the edge, and I went a little bit rogue
Evidence sediments said I did it, but no
Better than ever; but then, I really don't know
Whether I'm better or whether it is unknown
But it don't really matter
Critics still chatter
In psychoanalytical tones
Stickin' the innocent men in prison
Is really indicative of
The level to which indifference grows
So it goes...

(CHORUS)
I wanna float...and get lost in the ocean
And ain't nobody gonna stop me from goin
Cuz I'ma hold it wide open...
Yeah, I'm out to get that lau-lau money
That lau-lau money
That lau-lau money, yeah
And I'm fit'n to make it
Loud-loud for ya
Loud-loud for ya
Loud for ya, while I can

(Bridge)
I wanna float...and get lost
I wanna smoke...and get glossed
Wit the city in my rearview...
Way, out
Where nobody can hear you
Rummagin' around in your baggage
And the chain on your ankle keeps draggin'
Jus floatin...lost in the deep, and tryna live
Wit the city in yo' rearview...
Way, out
Where nobody can hear you
Nobody can fear you

(CHORUS)
I wanna float...and get lost in the ocean
And ain't nobody gonna stop me from goin
Cuz I'ma hold it wide open...
Yeah, I'm out to get that lau-lau money
That lau-lau money
That lau-lau money, yeah
And I'm fit'n to make it
Loud-loud for ya
Loud-loud for ya
Loud for ya, while I can

(Outro)
I wanna float...and get lost
I wanna smoke...and get glossed
I wanna float...and get lost in the ocean...ocean...
