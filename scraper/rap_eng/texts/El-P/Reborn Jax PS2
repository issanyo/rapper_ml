[Verse 1: Cage]
If I could get this message to you, It's beautiful
Absence for seeing straight
And I'm leaning on horizontals for practice
If V8s, a level change, and the pH are correct
I'll be somewhere in-between triangle, circle, and select
If you see me out in packs, in a mask, an axe, and pants that match
With divine and scratch and a haz-mat truck with jacks
I'll be enemy@axe, but in all black with a laser attached for the master
Beat us, strapped, you could blast mats
And you don't wanna crash with apocalypse on the dash
In the rear-view are clear blue skies lost in the glass
Familiar with the past, cause most are destined to repeat it
I write about it, shout it, or leave it, it's there if you need it
They just wanna see it, lost two men, fast fam'
The control in my hand, she still walked out on my last man
Whether my name blinks the bottom or top, I'll be gone
It's becoming more familiar to you when you're reborn-born-born-born-born-born-born-born-born
[Verse 2: Cage]
The city glows to light the scene up
Eager to team up
Boy, you look into the abyss
You swallow your spit or your dreams up
I've seen this before
Probably more than I wanted
But since it was vomited
I happened to stumble upon it
So if you see me on the last lap
You can flash back to the trash that was ? track, that I talked back
When too many react like that, distracts the pack
With attack hands around full mound, pull back the stack
So be it, I be it, You clinging to it, scrambling
Meanwhile, the handling's so sick you're nerves are reaching for Klonopins
If I mispronounced, I mislead what you can't see
By this time I'm probably just biding my time with the beat
But in the absence it's the sinister sees the sentence
Spares resemblance and of course it mimics the menace
I slipped into a pair of undefeated's being reborn
Then run where I stand to keep my feet warm
