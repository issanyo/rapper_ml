Chorus (2x):
All these bitches nowadays ain't shit
So I guess I gotta build-a-bitch
Build-a-bitch

[Verse 1: Mr. Muthafuckin Exquire]
Sober and alone in my depression
Skimming through personals on Craighslist
Wondering why perfect women seek perfection?
I need a guide in life
My love compass seems to be defective
It always leads me in the wrong direction
And lands me at the end of this
Winding road
Where everything's cold
And now, I'm too far to go home
And I'm exposed ass naked
Try to scurry for help
Should I use my head
Instead I use what's under my belt
Thought I was fucking her
But in the end I'm fucking myself
Knowing most ho's they only want you for wealth
Oops my bad, I'm wrong, I mean stability
Who you're kidding with that bullshit
You're killing me
To please you I need a million me's
Multiple men, I'm X-men, ho
With different breed
Pepe le pew
Try to catch you and you run from me
What did I do, I only wanted you to love me?!
Always felt sorry for that nigga
Now I know his plight
Something foul must be up in the air
This ain't right
This can't be right
There's only one solution to this
I guess I gotta build-a-bitch

[Hook 2x]
Now all these bitches nowadays ain't shit
So I guess I gotta build-a-bitch;
Build-a-bitch;

[Verse 2: Mr. Muthafucking' Exquire]
Five and a half in boys
Being P-6es
Genie-bottle bubble ass I rub for three wishes
Keep 2 but I use one though:
I perfect bitch I can build from head to toe
Start out with her brain
Not so that she's trained but to make sure that she's sane
Funny like Kim Wayans
But strong Assata Shakur
Stay out the lime light like like Pop-ska-da-da(?);
Beauty like Kim Bushay (??);
Mouth like Fantasia, with ass like Cherokee.
She suck a mean wee-wee
After that she down to play WII
Our bond is not cosmetic
Is pure, these ho's fake mature
That shit's pathetic
Love me despite my flaws
And I swallow my pride
We both grown we don't need them lies
I know its real when I look in her eyes
I was mad at first, but now I just forget you
Apologize in advance for my temper tantrums
Sometimes this world becomes too much to handle
I need a shoulder to lean on without it budging
Someone to tell my secrets, without them judging
Cause that becomes a regret
They just throw it in your face the first chance they get
I know I sound upset
Been disappointed, by every chick I ever met
Ever met, ever met, ever met
Every chick I ever met
Ever met, ever met, ever met
Every chick I ever met...
Ever met, ever met, ever met
Every chick I ever met...
Ever met, ever met, ever met

I can't build no bitch...

[Oh please don't leave me lonely]
I can't build no bitch...
[I need a big freak to come and hold me]
I can't build no bitch
Let me, let me build a bitch...
Let me, let me, let me build a bitch...
Let me, let me build a bitch...
Let me, let me, let me build a bitch...
I can't build no bitch...
