Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ooooooooh-ahhhhh-hahhhhhhhhh
Hahh-hahhh-hahhhhh
Oooooooooooooooooooh
Ahhh-hahhh-hahh-hah-hahhhh
Ahhh-hahhh
Ahhhhhhh

The time has come at hand
Soon now the night will start to fall
Who will remember me
When they'll be nothing here at all
Here through the darkening haze
Straight up from where the hands call
Hanging above me
Clearly the meaning of it all
Of it all

Ahhhh, ahhhh

Moving my body, moving breathless
Oh aching
Carry me with you, to where I belong
Please, take me there where I... oh baby

Ahh-hah-ahhh
Ahhh-ahha-hahahhhhh-ahhhh

Starlight is coming
Echoing through eternity
Flooding my body, yes
Midnight
