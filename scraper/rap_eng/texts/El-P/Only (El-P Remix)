[Intro]
I just made you up
To hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up
To hurt myself
I just made you up
To hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up
To hurt myself

[Verse 1]
I'm becoming less defined
As days go by
Fading away
And well you might say
I'm losing focus
Kind of drifting into the abstract
In terms of how I see myself

Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
Sometimes I can see right through myself

[Verse 2]
Less concerned about fitting into the world
Your world, that is
Cause it doesn't really matter anymore
(No it doesn't really matter anymore)
No it doesn't really matter anymore
None of this really matters anymore

Yes I am alone
But then again I always was
As far back as I can tell
I think maybe it's because
Because you were never really real
To begin with
I just made you up
To hurt myself

[Interlude]
I just made you up
To hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up
To hurt myself
I just made you up
To hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up
To hurt myself
And it worked
Yes it did!

[Chorus]
There is no you
There is only me
There is no you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me

[Bridge]
Only
Only
Only
Only

[Verse 3]
Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye
And it turned out to be a scab
And I had this funny feeling
Like I just knew it's something bad
I just couldn't leave it alone
I kept picking at the scab
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
But I climbed through

Now I am somewhere I am not supposed to be
And I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
And now I know why, now, now, now I know why
Things aren't as pretty
On the inside

[Interlude]
I just made you up
To hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up
To hurt myself
I just made you up
To hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up

[Chorus]
There is no you
There is only me
There is no you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me
There is no you
There is only me
There is no you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me
