[Vast Aire]
Yeah, know what I'm saying
Think you got it figured out by now

If first you don't succeed try, try again
Step up to the mic and die again
This is the next lifetime and you want to battle
Either you like reincarnation or the smell of carnations
The sample's the flesh and the beat's the skeleton
You got beef but there's worms in your Wellington
I'll put a hole in your skull and extract your skeleton
Oh my God, said a word twice
Vast Aire, I'm twice as nice
You get caught up in my blade, might get diced
The flesh is dangerous here
Yo, yo, it's Can O, yo
If first you don't succeed try, try again
Step up to the mic and die again
This is the next lifetime and you want to battle
Either you like reincarnation or the smell of carnations
The sample's the flesh and the beat's the skeleton
You got beef but there's worms in your Wellington
I'll put a hole in your skull and extract the gelatin
Mustard seed, faith move mountains
This is the jailhouse rap, rock hard
Like faces in a cell block
You'll catch a Kennedy curse from the speed knot
Son, I mack cause I think different
Plus your girl's sex technology, I want to plug in
Now every egg my goose lay stay golden
With your poker face, I punch you in the stomach and you folded

Yo, see what happens
Fuck with the wrong people
You might get dragged into a kitchen, cut up
This is for real right here, Def Jux right here
I'm serious, yo, Vordul Megalah

[Vordul]
Spit with lyrics, that spill off the grill nasty
Off the top, live five fancy
Fly mic strapped with nozzles
Blowing Earth's color through a nostril
Apostle that write novels with thoughts mega hostile
Ready to pop you, venomous snakes out the Congo
What through these clear optics
Yo Allah shall watch you
Rap in the coldest winters, strapped with
All sorts of snorkels attached to hoods
That pull over Motorola goggles
We pigeons equipped with talons to twist, split owls
Now watch me skate off the scene with a mongoose
Pop a wheelie and alley-oop
Deuce bottles of frozen bong juice
Smoke bubble gum while munching on Milanos
We crazy, off the head, lazy
Blaze emcees, amaze with degrees
On a higher level, inspire devil to leave
God cipher alone, bomb pipes on bones
Architect when I write these poems, write these poems, write these poems
