I'm on some (sshhh ... sshhh ...)
Watch what you do (do)
Who ya do it with (with)
Who ya do it to (to)
I'm on some (sshhh ... sshhh ...)
Watch what you do (do)
Who ya.... yo
(dNA)
Yo!

(Verse 1)
I don't give a [_#%$_] what you think of me
What you think of my life (life)
What you think about what I think about?
*Chik-chika-POW* - takin' your life (life)
Flicker like a lightswitch, oh (oh)
Giving me the evil eye
Watching me to see if I even try
Big Brother with the Eagle Eye
CCTV on live
Everybody tryna read between my lines
Compromised police read me my rights
And see me as guilty 'fore I'm even tried
Now, my big homie, that's Judge [___#%$___]
She throws me in jail for like nuthin
I guess a break-and-enter ain't nuthin
But still, it ain't like I'm violent, hijacking pilots
You can track the mileage, I'm real
Tryna think what I did to attract the vilest
I'm Baskin-Robbins, I'm chill
Tell me, what's your problem?
In my hometown, you either skirt the laws
Or you fail
All these first-class citizens
Going on about fittin' in
Only thing I care about fittin' in is
A Large or XL
I got some [_#%$_] I wanna run past these fools
And I'm on my peaceful P's & Q's
Until you light up my fuse, (so, y'knowww)
Two-zero-one-oh: moved back for the summer
Looking like someone from 'Gummo'
A son of a son-of-a-gun, though -
With a gun in your ribs, you just dunno
Grip; white knuckles

(Chorus/Hook)
I'm on some (sshhh) so watch what you do
Who you do it with
Who you do it to
(Work - work)
'Cuz somebody's watchin' on ya
Yeah, somebody's watchin', and they got
AK's, Kevlar, frag grenades that go BOOM
C4, claymores
No one's bulletproof...no
Ain't nobody bulletproof....no
We'll let a bullet be the proof

(Verse 2)
Givin' you truth / fact
Matter fact, MORE than that, cuz
I'm sick of this dumb (sshhh)
New Brunswick's got a fungus
Called 'Miramichi' - where I'm from... (from)
And everybody gotta get in my business
All mouth in a small town
Y'all clowns
Waiting for me to fall down, but never knowing
Whether or not you're on my hit-list
And your biscuits'll get burnt
Don't risk it, you'll get learnt
Cuz a man'll get vicious
And he gifted
Take a listen and get turnt
Sean Price took me to Boot Camp
The Game took me to Church
ScHoolboy took me to Hoover Street, and then
Ferg took me to Work
(Puttin' in WORK)
Jerks all in my face
They're the ones got me feelin' so bummy
Job board says 'Encorp'
And then [___#%$___]'s stealing my money (my money)
And for real, it really ain't funny
Nothing but chamomile in my tummy
Sippin' on camel milk and thinkin' how good
A ham-sam would feel in my belly

(Chorus/Hook) [2x]

Work...work...work...work...
