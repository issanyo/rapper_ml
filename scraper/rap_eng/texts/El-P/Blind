[Verse 1: Bigg Jus (& El-P)]
Yo, yo yo yo, yo
It's a shame when these MC's fuck with us
Yo yo, yo what they call you kid?
Yeah they call me Bigg Jus
(Yo, it's a shame when these MC's fuck with me
Yeah what's your name son?
They call me El-P
I must be, entirely, too fuckin nice
El the Don Digital, pass off to the right)
From now on I'm impeachin Nautilus, substitution, Mardi Gras
Hot Nickel is back from filing at the Shark Bar
Fuck the Shah, bringin it to you live after dark
Ask the Psychic Friends, the rhymin-ass cypher with the blends
Kings of many men, ancient wisdom, sizzles in
Got a whole crew of girls bent you raped Bell Bottom Tim
This concluding a broadcast from here to the next millenium
Off you niggas execution style ?
(The prime directive is to mostly play a part of utter psychosis
Not prone to play stationary man hopeless
Gene pool tumors get rocked without discretion
Fashion MC's drop now they part of my fall collection
Dementia earth burners while Earth sinks further into servitude
Hollow UFO's is comin in
And bill collectors get clicked on
Subtle murderous murder verse form a corporation
In beef we briefly bankrupt but you suck litigation)
The mixed bastard, wherever I lay my stat I oughta booby-trap it
Super duty tough word, singin some stylish caged graphics
To kids, who find a hornet's nest just for excitement
I laughs when some Mars Attacks when I bust up ?
(It's all fantastic when I bank, grand martial arts shouldn't faze me
I see-through pussy like the Invisible Woman
Teenagers turned trick pimped by pedophile labels
They started but fall from, soon to be disabled)

[Hook]
I want to be paid, MC, berzerker
Banshee, tryin to eat, just livin
I want to be paid, MC, berzerker
Banshee, tryin to eat, just livin

[Verse 2: El-P (& Bigg Jus)]
(I must be, entirely, too fuckin fresh
Jus the killer Funcrusher, pass off to the left)
And I, cut most meticulous
Descriptive clip from the hit you done shit on site as ridiculous
And under my thumb went numb hackers
When EMS workers caught blood from slug catchers
Here's the limit dusty but digital
With a far more rugged approach than Red Asia
Bust the sundial, wild advanced placement in effect
For me, it's either rhyme or euthanasia
Stands brittle but b-boy shell rugged and practical
Subtle anarchy, climate is unadaptable
Vulcan, logic, brought upon his destruction
Attack him at the fulcrum and society can't function
(I've been underground since thirteen literally
Bombin the whole system up, beautifying the scenery
Bless the turns I step up off these New Balance 580's on
No order fool coherency Clinton speak Egyptian
Get cocked, not back in the jungle, ease up friction
High dose of energy fuels my fermenting splintering in three sections
Each capable of launching attack in any direction
Hook it back up and connect it
Death-defying, all up on your e-mail addressing
I defy, any and all attempts at logic
Gray matter material formulate engineering solids
?Truck the vat scientific frontage off of science?)
Every bloodline is tainted, signifying malignant rapture
Who with bad intentions of boogeymen and death as a source of laughter
(Yeah your precious family tree'll end this century
No traditions to pass down, ?spend your way out of eternity?)

[Hook]

If I have to live on this earth without sight
I'll be the illest blind bastard, to ever touch a mic

To bust off with a mic, like that, the tracks is over, we came fat
End it right there, like that...
