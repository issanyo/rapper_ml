And enjoy our show

There was a baby in the metroplex
Mother with a dependency
Embarrassment made public
I see it in slow motion
She exposed her violent tendency
And hovered
Smacked the little bastard on his cheeks
Until he was screaming out in tongues
With confusion in his retina
I couldn’t convince myself his inhabitance
Off planet parental absence
But put your penny to famine and prep for flight miracle
When the best of dime store gods propser
It’s ever clear
Bushwick Bill flashbacks of ever clear visions
You can analyze that shit to make some sense but somethings missing
Its the deficit of moments of love from noise artist
Using void for voice inflection
Part of a moist infection
It results in mo tension, and fired like a joint brethren
But ones a dust sucker, the others a cop lopping off lead of the first amendment
Clutching a loaked basket of raspy addicts
Acting as if its it criminal to be weak and not tragic
And he can’t feel his mothers sadness
But back to the protagonist
I be handpicked with a social focal point to anoint action
And enigmatically employed by the divine mind to be ?
First I’ll fade the location by scanning local police sirens
You call us a battle rap, you know arbitrary word ripped from the Thesaurus
The mere thought of these most twisted individualist brain patterns are morbid
The dusty kids hit like teddy bears thrown against wooden doors
By a misunderstood teenage girl in a moment of self-importance
And you call my flow off beat
You’re unskilled with a fucked up tangled pattern
Cuz the mere thought of sounding like those you revere fills me with sadness
Cornerstone burner tone that outlines bricks with shifty throw up
For all our friends who lost their lives before they had a chance to see us blow up
We went from a crew of crusty outcasts to the most debated in the industry

As far as I’m concerned, no delivery

Maximum B-Boy Axiom stabbin’ shit
Don’t get me wrong, Co Flow is the shit
This is not in my head (4x)
Maximum B-Boy Axiom stabbin’ shit
Get off my dick

This is a genuine night ‘noid apocaloid pack rat
Cash flat, in fact
Stashed away water
And candles and dry milk and cat food
And money and batteries
And when the world didn’t explode, most of my close friends laughed at me (hahahahaha)
Cuz for years the empire of my belief system was a cancerous vision
I couldn’t shake the dread
Locked in my headspace
Knocked nightly, frightening
Fighting the feeling, this was entropy
Visions of sentience, death and bomb threats
Its the textbook freak with the Cassandra complex
And friends and family felt the effects of the fanatic
With frantic fabric conspiracies, ?, flying robots, cloning, classes of cops
Police states, talking computer, numeral digits
And when the topic was ?, you can smell the sickness of fear
From the self-professed soothsayer who had it all clear
I knew since 1984, that there were cameras in the cable box
Lowjacking on money
Full control families will welcome 12 monkeys
Every book I read was Bradbury, PKD, Orwell, ?
Steve Goldman, ?, Ellison, Anton Che
So my negative utop was coming closer each day
I made my mother leave the city and buy a water filter
From the best in the industry, sounds sort of silly
With rounds of ammunition for chains, sprayed in my helmet
You couldn’t know the faith until you felt it, and I felt it
Trying to get a grasp on the situation seemed helpless
But I was in my shelter, my sisters with her friends
My mother’s outta town, the world is gonna end
It was suggested I meet with my sis, but I passed
I’m at this chick’s crib on three tabs of X gettin’ ass
For the last time, watching the screen for that sign
Maybe a rogue scud, meltdown from Russia with Love
Or just a blackout in the city that we can see from above
Or just a riot in the streets that we can see from above
Old landslide  from the city of slugs and wet mud

Don’t get me wrong, Co Flow is the shit

But there’s only life and that’s it
