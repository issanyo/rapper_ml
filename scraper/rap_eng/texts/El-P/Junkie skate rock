Yeah yeah yeah y'know, yesterday I was down in Fort Mall
These kids tried to step to me like Def Jux wasn't doin it (WHAT~?)
I'm like - dawg, for what, why you steppin up to me like that?
You ain't even know who I am (right)
Y'know, but they like, they're on some stuff like talkin 'bout
El think he's a man, he thinks he knows, this dude's this great asshole
The dude could be an asshole, y'knahmsayin?
He doin his thing! They tryin to be him, but you know
I was tryin to pick my sneaks out anyway
And these kids tried to step back up to me
I'm like - dude, I'm pickin out my sneakers, can I pick out the color or som'n
And they just keep walkin up to just keep sayin this stuff to me
So I'm like yo, yo, if y'all don't back up offa me right now
Yo I promise to God I'm a libel to flip my wig straight up
Straight up [x8, fading]
[El-P]
Let's boil it down to the simplest [x2]
[deep voice - quiet whisper] Ahh, Def Jux is really fresh

Let's boil it down to the simplest [x3]
[deep voice - quiet whisper] Ahh, Def Jux (ONCE AGAIN!)

Let's boil it down to the simplest [x2]
[deep voice - quiet whisper] Ahh, Def Jux is really fresh

My country's crazy baby
Your country's crazy too
We got our weapons ready
You got your weapons too
Let's get these drugs and zone out
Maybe we'll lose our minds
And we can rock this Def Jux music
It's the end of times

[Chorus 1]
[instrumental to fade]
