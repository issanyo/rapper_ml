Ever heard of me
Open heart surgery
Hardcore poetic informed without burglary
Hard-body trained to fight the revolution
Cause I grew up on Spike Lee and Pac's music
My dialog will put shadows on the Sun
Rock Paper Scissors
Bombs blades and guns
I never had hoop dreams I was too short
Wanted to be like my pops with a box of new-ports
He used to bump Too Short in his Cadillac
And now they call me Too Short with some swag to match
And half of that, is just to get my passion back
I made a vow never end up like these rappin cats
Super Ugly fool so wheres the fashion at
Sackcloth Fashion Expo , Special delivery
My history is misery
I watched Malcolm X and Ruby Bridges religiously
Oklahoma. Respect us and I put that on the set cuz , Blood
What ever your callin, ballin
Just like im Lil Troy , just to make a little noise
Sick of deception arrested without confession
Murdered the whole game using words as a weapon
Smith and Wesson blast then ask questions Ugly!

Carlitta Durand (Chorus )
Your show is ugly, a monster super ugly, super ugly
Your show is ugly, a monster super ugly, super ugly
Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, yeah
Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, yeah

This for Ferrison , breathe deep, breathe easy
When opposites attack, rap competition lacks
Hitting switches like it's 92, or 93, nothing but a G
Currency till I'm free
Magnified to the 10th , I've been cool since I was 6
Remember me, the same kid in 8th grade, bumping El-P on tape
Super ugly in the face, acrylic with the lyrics how I crafted
Old dirty bastard, Mumia and Assata , caprices and impalas
Im a rider and You don't wanna
I Pray my words spread past Oklahoma
Black man, black skin, vampire smiling
And you so awful, homie, I'm so awesome
Tipping 44 out the sun roof flossing
Super ugly, the eyes of the beholder
Holster, over, I'm supposed to get closer
Closer, yeah, closer to the edge
So don't push me, I'm Mike Tyson in the head

Carlitta Durand (Chorus )
Your show is ugly, a monster super ugly, super ugly
Your show is ugly, a monster super ugly, super ugly
Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, yeah
Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, yeah
