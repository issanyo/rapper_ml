[Intro]
Bring me the dramatic intro, machine

Fell asleep late, neon buzz
PTS stress, we do drugs
City air strange, sticky lungs
Mayor Doomburg gives no funds
And I'm crying (crying)
Crying (crying)
Call out with a fiendish ring
Broken into smithereens
Everything's exactly how it seems
And I'm crying (crying)
Crying (crying)

[Verse 1:]
In a world of super duper whores, the kids just want a little more
Little tyke goes through the bloody mind sex with a veteran's decor
And I'm crying
Crying
So when I step in the stop frame, I became pure BK
'Cause I grew up on the krazy kings and inhaled second hand spray
And I'm crying
Crying
Where the walls talk your defiances and alliances were made
With a fugitive dash after class, to harass the gods of fame
And I'm crying (crying)
Crying (crying)
And the goons that I collude with on this rude shit same way
And will break a crab down in public, just to manipulate their pain
And I'm crying (crying)
Crying (crying)
Why should I be sober, when god is so clearly dusted out his mind?
With cherubs puffing a bundle, tryna remember why he even tried
Down here it's 30% every year to fund the world's end
But I'm broke on Atlantic Ave tryna cop the bootleg instead
Pure savage established hard rock talk circa '93 proof
Walked the high road to infinity with similarly truant moves
When a wandering ration line derails, I steal food
Maybe tread where the sidewalk hawks look alive and hide tools
On a bed that someone else made
Tryna wait for the next boot
And it drops when you took prime-time hellemundo off mute
Old folks say "time to build"
But demolition pays more loot
Rip patch from your hazmat suit
Slip past with an odd bop (woop!)
El-Producto, sorta strange
They say he stares at you, long range
Perhaps he's looking past us all with his thousand yard gaze

[Bridge:]
And I'm crying
Crying

[Verse 2:]
And he sees how MC's became contorted with their own lies
And went from battle rap to gun talk
Like we ain't notice the change (yeah, right)
(Please)
It's the city I broke down in
The velour couture township
Where they lost the rock box batteries and forgot how shit was founded
And I'm crying (crying)
Crying (crying)
Critics all see me twisted
They don't get my whole existence
An actual b-boy brainiac who'll slap you out your mittens
And I'm crying (crying)
Now, I feel that motherfuckers owe me dap for contributing actual raps
That's not a construct from the radio, on that plasticince path
I'll be your homie, bust through the door, we're lonely
All cast aside and homely
Probably why people call me the vigilante words
It cert' hurt and it don't be
And the last of all I have is yours, surrender nice and calmly
As a tot, played on a block of bricks and double-dutched with the zombies
I'll rip your squad to nothing but a cock ring a pair of puerto-rock dunks
I built the bag that cats will drown in when the water's colored rust
And the last thought that I had in the back of the little bus
Was of a Oklahoma city flair through kiddy flesh fade to dust
Move me with, little soldier bitty
We'll cloak and dagger the city
We'll hope to stagger magnificence to the pattern of blasphemy's quitting
And I keep my meaning tucked deep, so y'all creepers give me some privacy
Don't ask for something literal from a child of secret society
There's a position to be filled, you fuckin' assholes
Keep your eye on me
But save your precious advice
'Cause in my life everyone's lied to me
And I'm crying

[Outro]
Fell asleep late, neon buzz
PTS stress, we do drugs
City air strange, sticky lungs
Mayor Doomburg gives no funds
And I'm crying
Call out with a fiendish ring
Broken into smithereens
Everything's exactly how it seems
And it would seem that I am crying
