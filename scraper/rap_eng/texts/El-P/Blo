(BLO!)

[Akrobatik]
What? Lemme find out
Somebody wanna throw it to Perceptionists in a rhyme
Bout
(You getting sent to time out)
Hit the corner son
See our ship (BLO!) when I let the shine out
I'm outstanding when I start landing
Blows that leave ya crew disbanding
Mr. Lif and Akrobatik live y'all
Doing the damn thing
Got crews running and they pulling they hamstring

[Mr. Lif]
Injury, grab the Ace Bandage, face damage
Rip out ya tounge to change language
[Talking in other language]
Did I scare ya? (uh)
Here's some laws to adhere ta
Step in, step up, or break north
My rebuttle is a spaceshuttle ready for takeoff
Blast away, I eat the sun, pass the day
Peace to Jam Master Jay

[Akrobatik]
We ain't gilligan's isle style cast aways
(Bam Boozles)
Doing what masters say
(we'll broose you)
Perceptionist crew is a who's who
Of dope beats, rhymes, and cuts now WHAT (now what!)

What's that sound the jams about to (BLO!)
Lif and Akrobatik, yeah we don't sniff (BLO!)
You might miss the bounce as the wind (BLO!)
How could you be commited if your girl won't (BLO!)
I heard your new album kid, that shit (BLO!)
Here's an oppurtunity you just can't (BLO!)
Come see Perceptionists at the show
If you wanna see the real flow lets GO!

*scratches*

[Mr. Lif]
Come back, and hit the booth with ultimate force
Back up, and hit the roof with an ultimate force
It goes *blows*..
When I let blow
Take a suck it up, motherfuck, back to Electro
This ain't no fraternity stepshow
This ain't no feternity step show
Wait, you'll be traded up state like Bledsoe
Freeze, don't you move a muscle I said so
Stand to these, check to these, here come the dread
Flow

[Akrobatik]
I love it when I see my people bobbing they head yo
Crowd straight wiling got security petrol
If you think you too good to move ya ass
Take your narrow tail to the back of the class
Yeah I know we known for bringing facts to the mass
Me and Mr. Lif back to back for the past decade
Now we moving on to the next phase
New album (world tour), let's get paid!

[Mr. Lif]
Everybody in the place better duck down
You try to jump up, you'll getta buck now
Rough style sandpaper, meet ya make-up, faker
Ak apply the back breaker

[Akrobatik]
You got your back broke on vinyl
Ask Mike Tyson, homeboy, "It's Spinal"
Niggas need to move on up like Lionel
You ain't seeing Perceptionists and that's final!

What's that sound the jams about to (BLO!)
Lif and Akrobatik, yeah we don't sniff (BLO!)
You might miss the bounce as the wind (BLO!)
How could you be commited if your girl won't (BLO!)
I heard your new album kid, that shit (BLO!)
Here's an oppurtunity you just can't (BLO!)
Come see Perceptionists at the show
If you wanna see the real flow lets GO!

*scratches*

It's that new shit, that new shit
It's that new shit, that new shit
