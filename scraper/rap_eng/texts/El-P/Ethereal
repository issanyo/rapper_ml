[Produced by The Etherealist]

[Intro]
Yo, it's The Etherealist
Murder on the fucking Dancefloor, 2014
It's just the beginning

[Verse 1]
You step to MadKilla, I’ll kidnap your children like I wrote Thriller
Ether stomp your whole crew like I’m fucking Godzilla
I’m iller than your kids’ drug dealer
The FBI will have to fake my death like Mr. Hitler
I’m Dorian Gray in a mirror and the monster’s getting clearer
The day it takes ahold of me is steadily getting nearer
I put the fear of God into everyone I cross
Into my mind, those who enter will be lost
Forever the boss; Ether take no hostages. I promise this:
I’ll swap your arms and legs like opposites
Like the king of Scotland did. I’ll pop you with the hollow-tips
A prominent conscience; I’m dominant and ominous
Yet I remain anonymous. I'm wicked with depravity
I dismember whores like the British Royal Family
You're witnessing insanity: this is how it reads up off the page
This is Ian Brady off a blood frenzy, eating brains

[Hook]
(It's Ether on the Track and I'm back with a fucking banger)
(You know what they say: that you get what you see, so don't you fuck with me)
(If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore)
(Anyone stepping to me, you'll get burnt)
(It's Ether on the Track and I'm back with a fucking banger)
(You know what they say: that you get what you see, so don't you fuck with Adey P)
(If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore)
(Representing in your face. You don't rep with us, you'll fucking pay)

[Verse 2]
The return of Jak the Ripper; shadowed sinister figure
Convincing children to kill their baby-sitter with a whisper
Got a list a’ everyone who talk shit about my fam
Finna burn their wives and children to death like Vietnam
I’m Iron Man. I traverse the wormholes of space-time
The Pillars of Creation and the origins of mankind
Stood with Nephilim at the birth of the planet
And I witnessed when Krishna fought the battle for Atlantis
Semantics’ all you speak. I’m the immortal technique
‘Bout to make your ass extinct like elephants in Mozambique
I’m at the peak of this rap shit: better get my ass a mattress
And I’m gunning for wack rappers like a Columbine campus
I’m disastrous; I’m a catastrophe. I’m Josh Milton Blahyi
All I see is already dead to me; you’re just the next to bleed
Heads will feed the earth around wherever I seat my throne
I’m Emperor Nero burning Christians in Ancient Rome

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rest in peace to Adey P. MOTD make wack rappers flee
The spirit of emcees decrease like deceased batteries
Gallery seats offered for the beats I drop and
Verses hit you in the throat with a chop, leave you coughing
Bitch, your coffin is picked out. Shocking how I spit rounds
Break bounds; batter the brick of your bitch' house down
You bitch-ass clowns better duck out the cypher
‘Fore we blast your face apart like a grassy knoll sniper
I decipher every rhyme you spit before you drop the shit
Syllables so quick, you split from cerebral down to your dick
I scissor kick you in the face: Tiger-Style; Johnny Blaze
Granted this name by a supreme race in deep space:
The Etherealist; exploiting your weakness
Move planets in sequence; manipulate seasons
Control you intravenous with the frequency I speak; my beats inebriate the weak
I feast upon your failure, seeking your defeat

[Hook]

[Outro]
It's Ether on the Beat; The Etherealist
Murder on the mother-fucking Dancefloor
Love to my dawg In2ition; History of Violence; Plead for Your fucking Life
Rest in peace to my brother MC Adey P
Love to G-Magz; J. Unit forever, bro
Five Saints clique: Steele Jacket, Quicket Bat, N64, B Grudge, E-92
Word to Bolly; word to Rodney Rush
Word to my dawg Oldboy, keeping it hardcore in the UK
Love to RapGenius and the RapGenius fam cause I'mma have a fucking good time annotating this one
Peace
