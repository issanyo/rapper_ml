Verse 1(EveryDeYoe)
Ugh--yo
The dro I blow got a glow like a disco ball
& This go hard cause my hearts been in it from the start
You artificial pace makers
Working with modern day slave traders
I'll take the scenic route, still get hot as the Equator
Eyes red like lasers
I'm high as Felix Baumgartner when I go in for a record
Goodness gracious, turn the page quick
Free no Masons, out the matrix
Eighths I face & create
Sixteens vivid as Sistine or an image of space
Way past the Hubble sight this Czech Republic Moldavite
I rock the mic like James Buster Douglas hip hop prototype like-
Who you know that bump Parkway Drive
Switch it to Tribe or Mac Dre, finish with some Hendrix Live
I vibe in divine skies off something that's synthesized
Been sitting on gold mines so I'm digging em out my mind
Universal language rhyme help us shift the paradigm
Keep hypin the dimes & dimes
Or put some meaning in your lines
I push the pen into the pad & POOF the purest words align
I'm proof to live is to die
Shoot, the vessels ride is nice but I've been to the other side
So now it's hard to decide whether to walk or to fly
Observe from Earth or be where stars shine
Mushin the move the crew designed
Sacred G's what I do or die
Across the boards we crucify, analogies and battle cries
I sink into skin like a bot fly
Your bone dry, burnt biscuit delivery quickly killed my appetite
Nobody half as nice precise as Christ in afterlife
Hit the woods like Tiger's wife then I can write a terabyte
& tear a hole through the terrible, typical grainy visual
And bring that 4k, this my forte, warm up like foreplay
You underestimate like my name's Bobby Boucher
Shout out to Mick J, we're sipping water like we're ripping MJ
Just take a second, self reflection of where you're stepping
Two sides to the spectrum one will give the right direction

Verse 2(Cryogenic)
