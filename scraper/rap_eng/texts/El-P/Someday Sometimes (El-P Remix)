I wish I could see you in the dark
Some of us blow but some of us softly spark
Some of them told me they saw you shining bright

To me it doesn't matter
If you're empty on the week end
If you're waiting for the summer to end and start again
It doesn't matter if you're writing foolish letters
If you put them in a bottle
If you're waiting for a dreamer
To answer through the water

I wish I could see you in the dark

To me it doesn't matter
If you're empty on the week end
If you're waiting for the summer to end and start again
It doesn't matter if you're writing foolish letters
If you put them in a bottle
If you're waiting for a dreamer
To answer through the water

Soon someday
Give it all away
All with nothing to say
And no reason to stay
Life's too tough
And love's not enough
To make me stop thinking of
What it's like up above
Yeah
