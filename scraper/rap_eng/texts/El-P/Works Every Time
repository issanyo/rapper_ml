[Verse 1]:
I've been waiting for you all week
Don't you know this a rotten time to not not be me
I've been waiting for an hour now, what the fuck is up?
I've got memories to lose man. I am in a rush
Don't make me suffer this dimension straight
When we can bend face. Let space pixelate
60 dollars for a new born you.
Pay no attention to these savages: they don't own truth
Pay no attention to the man behind the glassy smirk
I tried it your way, that advice you gave to me was dirt
Twenty-five and I can buy my way of planet nerf
Where the softest hearts are tossed around on astro turf
Charlie Brown's adult voice trumpets fade
And its ridiculous to say oblivions insane
And its insanity to think I'd recognize my name
I no longer speak the language, I have chosen change

[Hook]:
Its like a fresh start to a new world (And I'd do anything, anything anything)
To go home
It's like a fresh start to a new world
And I already want to go home

[Verse 2]:
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue
If I exist right now I damn sure can't provide you proof
Definitions of existence in this state are loose
You've done enough, relax, i'll finish tying up my noose
You had the fucking nerve to outstretch claw and point at me
But can't you tell by how I'm sweating I am finally free
You were right about me, all along, whoop-de-doo
Leave a message, I have disappeared and so have you

[Hook]
