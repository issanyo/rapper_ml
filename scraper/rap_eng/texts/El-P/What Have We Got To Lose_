[Mr. Lif]
FEAR-or is it just lack of information?
THERE-deep within the fabric of the nation
QUESTION-what will it take to break the walls?
ANSWER-strength from us and all of yall
Here's the stamp to the people- repeat after me
Put your hand over your heart and breathe deep
"I will no longer  pledge allegiance to a government
That makes no efforts to relieve my suffering!"
Tax inflation, home invasion-
Ask then what the fuck did they do with our payments!?
Put aside the work, then they claim we're complaining
Raise health care, cut back on education
The world's largest anti-war demonstration
Was answered by bombs dropping and blood draining
Don't forget the rubber bullets and jail time
Catch it on the net- you can see it in real time
You don't give a fuck about us, why should we give a fuck about you
The system works for the few
There's plenty of us out there, who might dare
Form and independent state, where life is more fair
We'll have our own laws, own schools, own cash too-
And none of these funds will flow to you
We're cutting you off cause it's clear we don't share the same views-
WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO LOSE!?!

NO MORE
And when we tolerate it for YOUR CAUSE
We'll be eliminiated
You're selling us dreams and lies but we'll no longer be abused-
WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO LOSE?

It's the same old story-
You turn on the news the scene is mad gory
Another old boy in a suit collects glory
And tells us all to worry
Cause it's "Orange Alert!" there's foreigners hurt
Let's hurry to the nearest bomb shelter, deep beneath the city
To talk about these imminent threats and janet jackson's titty
And which 'America's Top Models' are pretty
Whole time, got 'em cooking in the back, is some shitty recipe
Meant for me and you, meant to be consumed
If we enigneer the food right, we could feed the room for cheap
And their organs hit the road while they sleep
Pump 'em full of nicotine till they six feet deep!
(Peep this shit that's goin' on)
We no longer go along
With your disrespect, total neglect, and shitty checks
(YEAH)
It's time for the people to stand up and stop being used-
WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO LOSE!?!

NO MORE
And when we tolerate it for YOUR CAUSE
We'll be eliminiated
You're selling us dreams and lies but we'll no longer be abused-
WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO LOSE?
