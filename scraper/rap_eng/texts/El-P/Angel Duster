[Verse 1: El-P]
A little toast to the no ones with a nod to the masses
To the ones with the riches, from the ones who the rags fit
A little smoke for the gone boys, a little nod to the spirits
We're still here running 'round screaming, they're still here pointing and laughing
Don't walk away when I talk, I'm telling you "turn around, mister."
I got a permanent bop, who the hell do I think I am not?
And I'm twice as hot as about half of hell
I get lighthouse lit up, get down, Diduck
The boy got a barracuda bite, you can tell

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Got hope for the living, got prayers for the dead
In the sky, got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head
Got kush for the pain 'cause the world is dangerous
Driven great men insane, anchor themselves with angel dust
Somewhere between love and lust, a nut get bust and a baby get made
It seems that trouble trouble us and follow us like all our days
In every holy book it says we suffer, that's what it is
So riddle me this; from the womb to the tomb, why do we fight to live?

[Hook: EL-P, Killer Mike]
A little toast to the no ones with a nod to the masses
To the ones with the riches, from the ones who the rags fit
A little smoke for the gone boys, a little nod to the spirits
We're still here running 'round screaming, they're still here pointing and laughing
Got hope for the living, got prayers for the dead
In the sky, got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head
Got kush for the pain, the world is dangerous
Driven great men insane, anchor themselves with angel dust

[Verse 3: El-P]
You say you wanna be my leader, I think you wanna be my God
You say you on the side of the righteous (right) I say I'm gonna hang with the wrong
There's truth where the filth is, there's lies in the law
You want a whore with a white dress, I want a wife in a thong
You love fear and division (don't you?) I don't fuck with your symbolism
I don't give a fuck about power, I'll pluck an eye out a pyramid
Cut an ear from a mouse hat, go Van Gogh on a house rat
Find another mind to devour, motherfucker I'm really not hearing it

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
A pope is a fraud, a church is a lie
A queen is the same damn thing, you should pray to your fake god that she die
God really exists? I'll tell you, like this: it reside inside
And anybody tell you different, just selling you religion, tryna keep your ass in line
I kill my masters, I mentor none
That means when I die, that's it, my style is gone; I'm a one of one
One half of the great RTJ
Defeated the odds, went to war with the gods
Earned all our scars and came back straight (RTJ)

[Hook: EL-P, Killer Mike]
A little toast to the no ones with a nod to the masters
To the ones with the riches, from the ones who the rags fit
A little smoke for the gone boys, a little nod to the spirits
We're still here running round screaming, they're still here pointing and laughing
Got hope for the living, got prayers for the dead
In the sky, got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head
Got kush for the pain 'cause the world is dangerous
Driven great men insane, anchor themselves with angel dust
Angel Dust
Angel Dust
