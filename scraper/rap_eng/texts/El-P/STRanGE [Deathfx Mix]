[Verse 1]
I'm The Ace of Swords
The Ace of Swords & when I get it late
Come home late & overthink most everything
You're The Queen of Wands
U get it late
I set the table, tell U you're my everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Money in your pocket
Disk in your wallet
Only difference is the same
(Do u luv?)
Money in your pocket
Disk in your wallet
How did we get so strange?

[Chorus]
U & I r all alone
U & I r all alone
It's strange (so strange)
To know when
U & I r all alone
U & I r all alone & strange

[Verse 2 BOOTS & Eloise Fornieles]
I wanna meet the dawn U hate to haunt
In the greyest state
Make a great escape into the warmth of your embrace
Do u luv?
(Do u luv)
Do u luv?
(Do u luv?)
Do u LuV
(Do. U. Luv?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Money in your pocket
Disk in your wallet
Only difference is the same
Money in your pocket
Disk in your wallet
How did we get so strange?

[Chorus]
(Strange)
U & I r all alone
U & I r all alone
It's strange, so strange
To know when
U & I r all alone
U & I r all alone & strange
