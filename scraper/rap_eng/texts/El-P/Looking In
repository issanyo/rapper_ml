[Mr. Lif]
Goddamn Pops, that's cold-blooded
Can't believe you left me and moms alone
I'm goin through struggles in life
I could use your guidance right now nigga but you gone

I'm your son, a part of you, your flesh and blood, marrow and bone
How the fuck could you leave me alone?
Fuck the finances, teach me how to shave or how to behave
When some white niggas try to treat me like a slave
It's civilized lessons that I lack
You doubted you could keep me intact
With the proper information so I wouldn't be strapped, but I am now
Environment is ran down, I no longer stand proud
Dreams are in the damn clouds
And I'm here on the ground, with the fo'-pound
About to kick this nigga's do' down and bust fo' rounds
End up in jail, oh shit this is real
'Bout to slip, put down my gun and run
Back into my mother's arms, though I lack a father's charms
I realize I gotta stay alive and stand strong
God help me, I'm not educated or wealthy
Niggas outside is stealthy, and wanna melt me
Oh dear sweet Jesus, 'bout to fall to pieces
From my eye a tear releases, caught up in the creases
In my face for the years of slavery I wish to erase
And all the commonalities I wish to displace
Baby mommy baby daddy, it's addin to the death tally
Of the black family, if I find my wife I'mma marry
And carry out what they tried so hard to disrupt
And construct intelligent black minds
Workin with these hands of mine, my hours of labor
Will prove me to be a savior
And when I lie your little heads down at night
I envision through divine sight that your future is bright
As we rise above the plight, please don't be like your Grandpa
Stand tall, and it's pain like this that makes a grown man crawl
So I walk south 12 blocks and seen this kid playin catch with his pops
I couldn't help but watch, stopped
Copped a squat on a bench, though my face was drenched
Wiped the sweat off of my grill and chilled
Just notice as they build, so focused as they will
One another to a great day; I had to leave right away
I couldn't keep watchin somethin that I'll never have
Cause all I wanted was my dad {*echoes*}
