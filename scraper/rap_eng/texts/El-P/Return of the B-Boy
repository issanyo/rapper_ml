[Verse 1]
Seconds after I had been swept off my feet
Open flew the doors and in steps the beat
Complete with medical packs and four-fours
Looked at me and said, "Damn, this nigga needs gauze"
Wars are fought in the street
He got beat
The meek are disenfranchised and left weak
Peep these images I couldn't ignore
Personas of the rhythm who just walked in the store
The snare, Slim, sported a rare grin
Noticing damage within
Removed bullets and patched skin
The kick drum, Scurvy
Opened my eyes, he say, "Don't worry"
At the clerk, he fired rounds in a flurry
And the hi-hat, Matt
Tapped the hostages with his gat
Told 'em, "Break the fuck out and never look back"
They had performed like Miyagi for the kamikaze
Then they got me, walked me out past the local paparazzi
"I see, y'all reanimators"
"Sure, kid, ya jams are flavor
We need a savior and we came ta
Relay the data
I'll repay ya, major situation 'cross town
Our music has lost sound
'Cause they had us locked down
'They' meaning sucka rappers, herbs, crabs
Common clowns who be making shitty sounds in labs
They're defacing masterpieces
Just to blast to pieces
What's dope and hope that we'd accept a wacker thesis"
"Jesus
Where's the chamber?
Allow me to become the scum rearranger"
They said, "Focus your anger
And bring the rhymes that you wrote
Because these folks will hang ya"
I accepted their concern, turned to 'em and said
"Fuck that written shit, I'll flip these niggas off the head
What about the feds?"
"Ayo, we left them a decoy
We didn't want the beast to know we brought back the B-Boy"

[Chorus]
(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back
(Hiphop)
(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back

(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back
(Hiphop)
(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back

[Verse 2]
Hiphop is so wack the beats are fighting back
And I was sent to attack
So I'm following the map
X's mark the rappers I would soon hex with
Corrosive cadences that'll be leaving their necks split
Step by step, I'm headed toward the set
To analyze a threat
And make 'em regret the day we met
I suspect they got a smooth plot
I'm headed to the rooftops
That's where I'll make my stratagem
So I can splatter them
They were only half o' ten
Five less rappers alive
When we collide
The standard is dope
They didn't coincide
They were sacrilegious and vicious
With dark wishes, which is
To assure the core of hiphop withers, snitches
I dropped dime on how to travel back in time
So they can melt and misalign
Pioneers' patterns of rhyme
And I'm furious
Seething at what I'm seeing
Soon those niggas won't be breathing
I've seen what I got ta so I'm leaving
'Cause I wanna
Set off the slaughter for the evening
Niggas hopped on my shit list
With a swiftness
I'm about to rip this
Come bear witness

[Chorus]
(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back
(Hiphop)
(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back

(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back
(Hiphop)
(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back

(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back
(Hiphop)
(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back

(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back
(Hiphop)
(Hiphop) I'ma bring it back

[Beat changes]

[Verse 3]
Mic check
We had ill static over Illmatic
I reached for it
This nigga said I couldn't have it
So tragic for him to try to counter my magic
I'm rabid
Reached through his fucking face and grabbed it
Nigga
How the fuck did you figure you could interfere
With a music so potent?
Then I gazed at his skull for a moment
Before I moved on
Then I heard two songs
Distinct flavors
From Wu's Enter the thirty-six Chambers
I'm about to bring this nigga danger
He was elusive
An Uncle Tom carrying nooses
Strong yet spiritually useless
I gave him flashbacks of niggas getting treated like lab rats
Beaten with whips and straps
Hit him with conscience
Held a mirror up to his face
The motherfucker jetted out of the place
Who's next to get me vexed?
This rapper making idle threats
Claiming that he's got concepts
I stepped to him slow
Looked deep in his eyes
Seen a prison was within him, 'cause he's living a lie
I grabbed Daily Operation
Told him that man was not meant to rule the earth's population
These thoughts left him pacing
Now he suffers from brain disintegration
No thoughts or information
It started raining
Visibility low
This had no effect on my abilities, though
To murder an MC is standard procedure
I looked and seen this cat guarding Follow the Leader
But I'm a cheetah
The abdomen and chest deleter
Primary feature
My intense urge to bleed ya
While his blood's draining
I'm steadily aiming
To find the next nigga for maiming
That's when my instincts came in
Handy
This mega large nigga tried to brand me
I dodged a mega blast of energy
Then my mind aged a century
Futuristic data
For a complex matter
His power left a crater
I could peep the equator
He smiled, I could see him through the earth's vapor
Looked him up and down as we walked toward solid ground
What? My jaw dropped at what I found
Classics by Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul
B.D.P., P.E. and Run-D.M.C
Low End Theory, Three Feet
Criminal Mind, Takes a Nation of Mill
Time to kill
Run-D.M.C., self-titled
This nigga's my arch-rival
Survival
Not liable
Got up close and what I saw, I couldn't believe
My enemy was a genetic replica of me
Battling yourself is the biggest chore
It could leave your digits raw
A truly vicious type of war
So now I'm thrown off
Taken back
In fact, I didn't know how to react
I lacked a plan of attack
But his was in full effect
And next
He'd infect my intellect with thoughts I couldn't accept
Images of my grandmother in that old folks home
Became very vivid in my dome
His method is drastic, telepathic
Damaging my mental fabric
Hellified, horror, havoc
Crippled, I can't stand it
Or understand it
Yet my torture was expanded
By thoughts that he commanded
Had a vision of my uncle sitting dying by himself
Meanwhile, he's breaking down my physical health
Body blows
Several shots to the head
Ninety-eight percent of which were absorbed by my dreads
The other two percent I accepted
Just so I can feel the heat again
Had a vision of defeating men
So now I'm back
Strapped and intact
Increasing my brain waves to maximum impact
Thoughts were unholy
Slowly
He looked me up and down coldly
Like I'm the motherfucking phony
And maybe I am
Damn, I stuttered
Dropped the mic from my hand
Saw some open land so I ran
But as I jet past past thoughts
My man had blast shots
Blood clots
Stopping circulation to my knot
My ego split
My humility started to mumble feeble shit
The thug within me had a dream of Desert Eagle clips
So who's me?
Maybe this uzi
The cold-hearted steel with a sign that says, "Use me"
I call her Suzy
Do you like what you see?
Usually
I wouldn't let a biter confuse me
So why should this instance make a difference?
So I started to think with
The innocence of infants
And since I'm incensed
Burn incense
I'm intense
Funny how the powerful scent just
Dents his senses
Don't even count him in at the census
I sent this
Razor-sharp tone of relentless
Sequences that leap fences
Leading all humankind to deep ventures
So I shift forward like a Sith Lord with a swift sword
Flipped and clipped his mic cord
Speechless, riddled with weakness, peep this
He tried to use the heat of his desire to beat Lif
Be my guest
Take a guess who left the set blessed
And who was left a mess ("Fight fire with fire")
And at P's request
I summoned the sun to burn a hole in his chest
