The League Of The Extraordinary Nobodies was filmed before a live studio audience

[Verse 1: El-P]
I just counted in my head how many people in this room
I'm talking to that I would never give the time
Here we are, all being vain and looking at ourselves
In mirrors very closely nodding straight up in a line
All the funny little stories that are told
Are being fueled by what amounts to nothing more than minor crime
But I'm a whore and I'm exploring territory where the party and the pussy
Both are numbered with a dime

I've been thinkin' that this frozen glow I've chosen
Is a candidate to lead me to a very sudden end
Another room up in the tombs of lovely substance
Where the grave diggers are shoveling that dirt up in her heads
The very fact is that I'm sitting here with zombies talking endlessly
But couldn't tell you one thing that was said
I get surrounded by the friendliest of strangers
Who would sooner kill themselves than give a fuck if I were dead

I just realized the tragedy of this
Is that her hand is on my leg and she so clearly wants to fuck
And though I'm wired, and I would certainly oblige
I can't continue getting high and then confusing it for lust
I'm not an angel, but the baggie we unfolded
And just split to give a lick is dripping out me colored rust
And you seem nice but I still hate you for the moment
Cause I'm too smart to be open, this is artificial trust

I've been noticing the fact that nothing glorious can happen anymore
We've run the gamut of our filth
But here I am again, pretending spontaneity exists with idiots
All lifted out their little gills
Aren't you disturbed that everything you did tonight is something else you did already
And its meaning is still nill
And all the people in your presence are just weapons
It's as simple as the theory that the dying love to kill

Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody here is so alive

Oh, what a night
Oh, what a night
Oh, what a night
You would tell me if I was crazy, right?

I've been wondering how arrogant it is for me to keep doing the things
That killed so many that we know (Know know know)
I've been noticing how quickly motherfuckers have the answers to existence
Just as soon as someone goes
We change the channel for a week or so of cleansing and reflecting on ourselves
But then it's back to that old show
I hear the cackles of the crowd, they're laughing at us
And we haven't even gotten to the part where it's a joke
