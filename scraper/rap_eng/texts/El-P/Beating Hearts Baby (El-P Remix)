[Intro]

Baby is this love for real?
Let me in your arms to feel
The beating of your heart, baby
The beating of your heart, baby

[Verse 1]

You, you want nothing to do with me
You, you want nothing to do with me
I, I don't know what to do with you
Cause you don't know what you do to me

[Chorus]
Baby is this love for real?
Let me in your arms to feel
The beating of your heart, baby
The beating of your heart, baby
Baby is this love for real?
Let me in your arms to feel
Your beating heart, baby
The beating of your heart, baby

[Verse 2]
Girl, you really got your hold on me
You, you really got your hold on me
You, you gotta get away from me
Cause you, you want nothing to do with me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
In spite of you of you
Even out of view
Still I love all of you
I do, yeah
In spite of you
Even out of view
Still I love all of you
I do, yeah
You want nothing to do with me
You, you want nothing to do with me

[Chorus 2]
Baby is this love for real?
Let me in your arms to feel
Your beating heart, baby
The beating of your heart, baby
Baby is this love for real?
Let me in your arms to feel
Your beating heart, baby
The beating of your heart, baby
