[Spoken: Mr. Lif]
How the hell did it get to this?
This what I gotta do?

Mic check
Mic check
Check

[Verse 1]
Well, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em
Real deal McCoy 'em
This kid got gold teeth?
Fuck it, coin 'em
So we can get some loot inside our pockets
My man who just did a bid said, "You haven't tried it, don't knock it"
I wear the rings of Saturn on my knuckles
Like truck jewels
For forty acres and a mule
I'm down to buck fools
My two illest thoughts
Could make the world a realm of lost souls
Keep my mind in two poles
Peep the world through two holes
In my head juxtaposed
I sight and murder foes
On the low, I conjure flows
The way that it's supposed to be
I drew ten rings around the rosary
I'm 'bout to rob this store
I need some loot and some groceries
I need a loaf or three, butter
Fuck another night of hunger
I've been a good man and I don't deserve to suffer
After this night
I'll return to being peaceful
Put that on my people
Word to Big Shank and Little Pete, though
Yo, do you recall the days when brothers used to chill?
Flex on the mic and display ghetto appeal?
Yo, those were the days when it was really real
Yo, those were the days when it was really real
But we'll all get it back together one day
But until then, it's 'nuff gun spray
Jah bless my head with every night I lay
And I pray for a brighter day
But anyways, gotta get them thoughts out of my mind now
Wipe the sweat off my eyebrow
Nostalgic thoughts bring my high down
"Lie down, you two niggas in the second aisle"
First brother shook with fear
While the second nigga caught a smile
"Why you doing that?
Why don't you strip like Gaza?"
This nigga yells out, "Well, you's a frontin'-ass Rasta"
"By my actions
I'd have to say that that's true
But shut the fuck up
I didn't ask you
I might blast you
If I have to
No mask, dude
They won't find me, even if you I.D
But, yo, thanks for checkin' me"
Then unexpectedly
This pet nigga right behind the counter started wetting me
Nine millimeter weaponry
Goya beans leaking on the chest of me
Nobody understands society molested me
They'll just question the nature of the ongoings
Cleanup crew pray my blood stop flowing
All my enemies out on the block gloating
Plus the government is smiling
'Cause they smell the scent of death blowing
Just showing that they plan's running precisely
"This nigga ought to fit into a wood box nicely"
Ghetto stress, had my own fuckin' people ice me
If you look, you can find me
On a corner store tile floor
Another landmark of the ghetto eyesore
Is it all worth to die for?

[Spoken: Mr. Lif]
No [echoes]
It's not worth it
It's not worth it
[Indistinct continued talking over echoes of "No"]

[Spoken: Fakts One, NASA and El-P (approximately)]
[Fakts One] Yo, oh, shit, money
This dude just got shot, son
[NASA] He got shot?
[Fakts One] Yeah, fuckin' shot, dog, tryna rob a store
[El-P] Yo, what's up, dog?
You got to...yo, what the fuck is this?
[Fakts One] That's fucked up, yo
[El-P] Yo, I think I went to...
[Fakts One] Yo, this ain't cool, though
[NASA] We gotta get out of here, man
[Fakts One] Yo, this ain't cool, though, I'm out
[El-P] Yo, where you going?
[Fakts One] We gotta get the fuck outta here
This kid's wylin', he's wylin', I'm out
[El-P] Yo, I think I went to high school with this kid

[Scratches]
"I'ma live life after this one crime"
