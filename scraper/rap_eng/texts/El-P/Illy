[Metro]
I write to melancholy rhythms, with the colors of pain
With a chemical imbalance that can smother your brain
Kinda pissed, cause I'm the player
Pull the plug from your game
Either that or put another burning slug in your frame
Make the call, I'll break ya skull, club in the cane
The tougher they came lame , the easier
The media can suck on the main vein
I do this for the music and love, pain, sweat, blood, rain
Rhyme shit, mud stains
Dirt nap, thug gangs
Purse snatch plus chain
Aggravated cause you living off of bus change
You don't know me, lets keep it that way
Fuck fame, Hip-Hop turn emo in Columbus
[?] The egos that I swallow, my stomach complains
Me and my niggas, one in the same
Open Mic battle title, that's something to claim
You know not its dope shot more than once in the vein
Need a fix, I got ingredients, summoning flames
Spitting kerosene on everything  but nothing was gained
Nothing new like baby mothers and a brother was slain
By ya cops, better buy a Glock
Ready, aim, fire shot

[Hook]
Cause Ain't shit worse than a wasted talent (Still)
Life goes on without it (Still)
Real niggas do something about it
Smash Brothers do something about it

[Camu Tao]
I'm on the freeway swerving with a bottle of Henney
Screaming to the sky that I'm high and about to get even
With these snake niggas venom all mixed in the blood
Throwing wrenches in the system, trying to fuck up the trust
Fuck cuz and his man all rappin with chicks
True playes can't fold while they stacking they chips
Fake niggas, they use slang
They get caught up with you [?] and then they lose brains
And fake niggas like loose change
They fall right out of the pocket and then they lose gain
They never had, never  stick you niggas for petty cash
Just Adapt and try to hook up a steady ass
Times is hard, never use em for body guards
Cause they'll come back for sure and leave your body charred
I love it, when bitches break down and cry for me
I ride dirty with a Glock, take time for me
My niggas gone be say this is a guide line for G's
And stay true to niggas, stay glued to the street
