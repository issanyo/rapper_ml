Still in Brooklyn
Lullabies chime crooked
For the harrowed and the shook-en
Back to dose me
Back to hold the high closely
For the sparrows and the butchers
See the blood moon hunters moon hear the howling
For the habit and the hammered and the cowering
In the magic with the haunted and the doubted
There are ghosts here
There's a presence there's a power
For the tightrope over tank with the piranhas
For the frazzled its a moment its a promise
To be broke down to be lowdown to be honest
Another showdown with the woozy and the conscious
For the aggy with the baggy with the bottle
With a smile with a sip with a swallow
And don't you ever try to say that you're not one of us, my love
We are the touched
We are entrusted with the same tomorrow

(Till I get there)
I'm still living like a four dollar vic. (Jumping off the world)
(Till I get there)
A lot of trouble four a little bit of win. (Jumping off the world)
(Until I get there)
In the gasoline and sulfur in the sin. (Jumping off the world)
(Until I get there)
You cannot throw me in the briar patch, bitch
That is where I live
(Jumping off the world)

This album is dedicated to Camu Tao

And this goes out to the...
To the maniacs
And aristocrat grifters
To the zealots
To the monarchs
What up brainiacs?
Compulsively acidic rainiacs
Repulsively predictable painiacs
To the liars
For the devils night fires
Same to you too town cryer
Top O'the morning morbid
Quite a day we're having gorgeous
Salutations unimportant
Hello uninspired
I thought I'd drop on by and wish you all the luck desired
I wish you all the souls your little mouth can tuck inside
You'll always be that special part of me
That loves to dine on grinning void
So flirty touches dizzy lust I must imbibe
And what a team we made
There's nothing we can't justify
But I am the son disgust entrusted with the undefined
And I can no longer contain whats under my disguise
I've always had the cancer for the cure
That's what the fuck am I

(Till I get there)
I'm still living like a four dollar vick. (Jumping off the world)
(Till I get there)
A lot of trouble four a little bit of win. (Jumping off the world)
(Until I get there)
In the gasoline and sulfur in the sin. (Jumping off the world)
(Until I get there)
You cannot throw me in the briar patch, bitch
That is where I live
(Jumping off the world)

I know there's
Something good that I'd die here for
Something great that I'd live here for
Something fly that I'd write for you
Something wrong that I'd bite you for
Something sick that you'd cure me of
Something said to make sure you're loved
Some of us cannot trust no one
Some of us don't deserve no trust
Nothing wrong with not being strong
Nothing says we need to beat what's wrong
Nothing manmade remains made long
That's a debt we can't back out of
Nothing that they can take from you
Nothing that they can do to me
Nothing I wouldn't do for you
Nothing left here but you and me

There's nothing they would do for you, differently
They're not even listening
They don't even glean what we're existing in
There's nothing here but love and you
Groveling, look what they're accomplishing
The systematic gods have all demolished it
But I've never felt so brave
As when I'm looking at your face
They can decimate my body
But my heart will not disgrace
They can torture and interrogate
And shackle to my boot
I will gnaw off my own leg
And hop the fuck right back to you
