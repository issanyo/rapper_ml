[Camu Tao Verses]
I watch TV everyday
I feel a little sick when i'm okay
Not up for talkin', just keep walkin'
Cause I ain't playing no games

I feel like I die every night
When the weather is good it ain't right
I get in fights every night
My [?] with the world it ain't right

[x2]
I wanna be a part of something bigger than me
I wanna be a little part of a much bigger machine


I------- wanna work for the government. (I really do)
I wanna work for the government right now. Now

[El-P Verses]
This is my chance to worship
What's left of me is your's now
You'll have to discipline me
Teach me to be your willing

I'll be your margin winner
Your millimeter gripper
I think I'm ready for this
I think I'm deadly dead-lit


That was a parcel for a martyr that my neighbor held
I think he knows I'm onto him now

[Both Verses]
He knows I'm working for the government
I'm in the government now
They got me working for the government
I'm in the government now, eh-ah (we did, we did it, did it)


I wanna be a part of something bigger than me. Yeah yeah yeah
I wanna be a little part of a much bigger machine

I------- wanna work for the government

I wanna work for the government right now. Now

That was a parcel for a martyr that my neighbor held
I think he knows I'm onto him now
He knows I'm working for the government
I wanna work for the government right now. Now

[x2]
I wanna be a part of something bigger than me
I wanna be a little part of a much bigger machine


This is my chance to worship
What's left of me is your's now
You'll have to discipline me
Teach me to be your willing

I'll be your margin winner
Your millimeter gripper
I think I'm ready for this
I think I'm deadly dead-lit
