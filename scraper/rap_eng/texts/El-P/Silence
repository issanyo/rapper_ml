I once was told of a mutant who could twist space around him
And now it seems that I've met him

[Intro: El-P]
Check this out
Company Flow manifests itself in many different ways
We rhyme like this is the last fucking days
Of course we've got El-P, DJ Mr. Len
And the one and only

[Verse 1: Bigg Jus]
Jus's style is infinite so pass me the rock
Got the same burner as the kid down the block
Bought it from an off-duty cop getting over
Yo he'll stick you with a felony just to fill a quota
I've got more styles than pagers by Motorola
Legendary seven yard claiming fuzz had inflicted it
When Blade and AD hit it
And Caine way back was killing it
Who's the wildest b-boy with the pace that is ill
Encased in a glass dome I flow mikes like filaments
I'm tungsten, light within that causes something
Lick off a legal shot trip the entry turn busting
The fendy? setter shot Joey numb nuts cousins bludgeon
They ask for it, permanent vacation with no passport
Top ranked televisor of boxing as a sport
I keep my gun cocked for all you hard rocks
And grab my crotch for one time when they roll through my block
Bigg Jus from the CF, and we rule non-stop!

[Hook]
Bigg bigg Jus, they start fuming when I set it
Breaking down with the flow
Bigg bigg Jus, they start fuming when I set it
After the verse

[Verse 2: Bigg Jus]
I got the fat cap Krylon paint, radioactive
Busting out sockets leaving Earth in this bastard
Rock the overdose, fiend back the graphics
Lost thought through a vortex, you came out on plastic
Crunch numbers buy mere thought last year candy gram
Busting VSOL, on some shit, I'm the man
Housing heads 42000 the reeper's dead
The underground's uncertain
Scrub skills keep resurfacing
Crypto cryogenic body soaked in mystery
Known for making emcees change belief from Tai Chi to ESP
When I drop skills sick like buy my gee
These heads hate me for having shit that bump like Teddys
Still refuse excess
Out-of-phase energy push Kevlar sub woofers
Composites, enemies
Face the finest squad the final conflict of Nimrod
The growth stunter run the shit down like Heather Hunter
Our father up in heaven control to uproot dark ruthless demigod
Notorious sets in half
That it can't be attacked by entering the dragon's path
And you won't last in the rugged badlands of the math
All due respect to the DJ breakdance and graf
I could go on about days going dashed
But I won't, indeed yes I will
I flush out more drug toxins than Goldenseal
