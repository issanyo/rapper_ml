Oh, oh, oh

That night I remember what you slipped in my glass
We came rewinding when
I foamed at the mouth while the lights winked at me
And now my shape is kept

The rain it can't hide, wash the paint from this hex
Is it so permanent?
Did she catch a left eye when it blinks three times
Or once just to seal you in?

In your drunken breath, did it stain like us?
In place of poison heat
I gotta rid this world of your intention
Swap the corpse in the casket

Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove [x2]
Does he make you feel alive?

When I seep inside your truth
Through suspicious little coughs
You sank your nails inside a key
While the door you shut closed up

The black stockings you kept, smell of wet cigarette
Torn of lust that you could not keep
I have slept inside your fault
To have you keep me here on this leash

For the rest of your pets, I will feed to this theft
As we consummate the vows of defeat
And when you pray for an end to this
I do believe this is eternity

Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove [x2]
Does it make you feel alive?

Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove
Your closet is bulging
White marrow withholding
Does it make you feel alright?
