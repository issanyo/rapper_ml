Trapped me in the trapdoor of a new york subway train
I prayed to see the light of the early morning rain

(get up, get up)

You are now listening to the sounds of the weareallgoingtoburninhellmegamixx2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2

When it all comes down to it, I'm going to get my fucking name up

[Hook]
It's the classic underground sounds of the, of the Krazy Kings, NYC
The classic underground sounds of the, of the Krazy Kings, get up, get up
It's the classic underground sounds of the, of the Krazy Kings, NYC
Classic underground sounds of the, of the Krazy Kings, get up, get up

(yo, yo yo)

[Verse]
This is for the names across filthy sky
Some of us remain upon the graves of the fly
I became a shepherd of self styled design
Everybody telling me that dog was divine
I guess I was seduced by the filth on the floor
I guess it just reminded me of shit that I saw
Something from the gut that struts and talks raw
Remainder of the dream I inherited from my Pa
I promised him in silence I would take it to the wall
Super duty tough shit or no shit at all
This is for the names across filthy sky
And everyone who told them that they shouldn't even try
Cause most believe that freedom exists in high flying
And have to live in calm behind the barbed wire
I could never speak a phrase you don't know
Maybe just design it with a Rust-Oleum glow
Pop it off the page and then trigger the right notes
We never want to fade, we pain; obtain hope
Fame is just a side effect of being well spoke
I remain the same mother fucker from when broke
This is for the names across filthy sky
And nothing said true could ever be out of line
I learned it from my mother who suffered a man's crime
I learned it from my sister who was raped in her prime
Now I'm a grown man and I won't stand for lies
And anyone who encounters me sees it in my eyes
This is dirty hard-fought bliss, not contrived
I'm ready every day to stay and not die
[?] ring
Contaminated kid from the world county of kings
Used to think that I live in a broken promise
Now I'm just happy to limp around in the dog shit
This is mine, this is yours, team the rock pit
The thoughts are beautiful, I want to put my cock in it
I'm taking this, I'm not waiting until they offer it
My patience is limited [?] melanin deficient
Arm under the law but if the weapon be that's raw
The soveriegns' being puked but I refuse to do shit wrong
Rose in a rarity and clarity of calm
Son of a man named Harry who grew up with his mom
Started the longest walk through the halls
Where the legends drown the bricks out by the simple art they scrawls
So this is for the names across filthy sky
Who put it up in colors that will make a man cry
You'll never know the truth of what you meant to our lives
And you became the proof that the truth can survive
I guess I was seduced by the filth on the floor
I guess it just reminded me of shit that I saw
Something from the gut that struts and talks raw
Super duty tough shit or no shit at all
Super duty tough shit or no shit at all
Super duty tough shit or no shit at all

[Hook]
