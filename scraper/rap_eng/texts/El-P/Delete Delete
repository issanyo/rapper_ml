[Verse 1: El-P]
It's not luck, I punch the clock, tough as fuck
All my ATL fam handlin' bucks
All my NYC crony put up
Beads on the abacus, rack 'em up
Weird to think that I'm still on break (Still?)
For twenty plus, I been out to lunch (Ay!)
Plenty punks mouth spoutin' dust (Ay!)
Built a bridge and just burnt shit up
Fuck I care about "life's not fair,"
Look we lucky just breathin' air (Yeah...)
Me and Mike here, zonin' out
Fly for years now no come down
You see air, I see lack of smoke (oh)
Smoke until my face fro-yo (oh no!)
Round or flat, shit Earth's a trap
ACME factory, you're da rat
Light years stylin over y'all pile of gomers
Style will lift your ghost out your loafers
Smile or pout you can't hold him
Name ring out to y'all golems
Fuck your elite, delete, delete
Indeed when da meek'll seize the street
Hear screams of "retreat," beamed from da fiends and the finks
Funny how quick shit change, one blink

[Chorus: BOOTS & El-P]
Lil Foot, Lil Foot
Come to the mountain
Come get your love
Lil Foot, Lil Foot
Come to the mountain
Uncanny love
(Fuck your elite, delete, delete)
Get some D'usse in yo cup, you're feelin' righteous
'Bout to raise these fuckas up like I'm Osiris
Lil Foot, Lil Foot
Come to the mountain
Come get your love
(Delete, delete)

What is the dark matter with you?
What is the dark matter with you?
Hmmm?

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I am not changing one bit, I am the shit, I am as good as it gets
I have been needy and greedy for more since I suckled my young momma's tits (Ah!)
Can not be silent when I see these suckas
And I know they soft as it gets
Soft as a baby shit, dump in a diaper
You walk in a pit and it's filled up with vipers
This villain is vicious is vary that I see the only thing matters around here is victory
Hickory dickory dock, word to my watch
Yo bitch is all on my cock, word to the Ak-inyele
Forehead was all on my belly and I was slappin' the jelly
And she ate pussy like Ellen and her convo was compellin'
But back to this murderous verses, I verts for the verses 'fore I got distracted all on that bitch
I am patiently, happily sewin' a tapestry
Filled with obscenities, strippers and activists
I'm the Bukowski of rhyme
Bitch I am me in my prime! Bitch do you follow that line?
Follow or shut the fuck up, pistol and fist throw it up, yup

[Bridge: Cristin Milioti]
What is the dark matter with you?
What is the dark matter with you?
Hmmm?

[Verse 3: BOOTS & Cristin Milioti]
Ooh, your friendship, it come and go
Your strangers are so scared when no one will go
Finger on the button, keep it 100, right?
(What?)

[Chorus: BOOTS & Cristin Milioti]
Lil Foot, Lil Foot
Come to the mountain
Come get your love
Lil Foot, Lil Foot
Come to the mountain
Uncanny love
(What?)
Get some D'usse in yo cup, you're feelin' righteous
(What?)
'Bout to raise these fuckas up like I'm Osiris
Lil Foot, Lil Foot
Come to the mountain
Come get your love

[Bridge: Cristin Milioti]
What is the dark matter with you?
What is the dark matter with you?
Hmmm?
What is the dark matter with you?
What is the dark matter with you?
Hmmm?
