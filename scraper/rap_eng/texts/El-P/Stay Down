[Verse 1]
You know I get down, I'm a downer, heart pounder, LOLin', smelling like Sarin
Felony forecast: El is, dressed to the nines like a target, dressed like a bullseye for a blind archer
Heart of a piranha, swimming where the blood chums water
Lark in the darkness watching, I got it this, boombox burner boy hot shit
Burn like an LA sunset, colorful, toxic, snuff stuff, deadly and erotic
Walk like a man not a product, run like a strumpet, talk to the hand sock puppet
Look at them sky write: "fuck it, we heart nothin', we don't have a tear for your bucket", life's but a pageant, that ain't on no deep shit, try to pull the curtain back crack goes police whip
Here come the stage mums, dress your little whores to display them, cutting through my brain like a ray gun
Telling you these fuckers are shameless, Obama to Reagan, look at how they bent to their training
Why would I be angered, not when I can chemically hang glide, angle, face dive mangled, anguish
Notice I maraud odd language, roll a joint
Hit a fraud god 'till he vanquish, bonus point

[Hook: Nick Diamonds]
I'm thrown
With all this chrome and
You sound like you're drowning
Drown drown drown drown
Get down, stay down

[Verse 2]
You know I get bent I'm a Bender, Futura-Ra-ma-Dom-inant gene gone bad and
Passed along to my blood stream pumping madness, pour a little hell down hatch it's
Standard practice how to detach from a white noise planet with a dispatch straight from command to throw haymaker plus land it, never take a win for granted
Remember the pitch that I sang with, to anoint masses, before, mass graves hatch like magic, everybody bows to the bastards, anthem acid dispatchers get rancid, fact of the matter I graph and track hapless, live in a mirage its hard to not crack kid
Whats that? pass it
Wanna watch? I'mma smoke till I'm bat shit
Choke like a champion

[Hook]
