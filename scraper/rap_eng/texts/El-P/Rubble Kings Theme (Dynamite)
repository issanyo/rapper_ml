[Spoken Intro]

[Intro: Sample]
I've seen Ak-47s
I've seen sawed off shotguns
I've seen all of this
I've seen dynamite on the streets

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Surrounded by violence and murder
Say, we in the streets and we grippin' on heat
You got beef then we fryin' your burger
My shoes on my feet and my words and my balls
Is all I got, fuck with a murda
Will happen to you, I am certain
I'm certain as hell and I'm grippin' the tail of Satan himself: the serpent
We pullin' in no social service
We go in the store, they look nervous
So down me to hell, damn me to jail, like fuck you, we robbin' the merchants
The preachers sound silly in service
Convincin' my mama that all of the drama must certainly serve higher purpose
How fightin' could turn into curses
When I tell her any god that make it plenty hard really ain't worth it to worship
Man, I believe in my patches, man I believe in my fists
Man, I believe in bandanas and pistols and holdin' down, rockin' my sets
Born into turmoil and trouble, I became King of the Rubble

[Verse 2: El-P]
Everythin' out here is broken, or blemished and battered, and tattered, but mine
You let it burn and decay and created the kings of the cinder divine
I am done asking and pleading and begging you recognize I am alive
You are done walking inside of the section youâ€™re treading in, there was a line
Cement block, hard rock, it don't stop, get it, get it
Your whole block's soft, it comes off like skittish bitches
We're wolves to the bitter finish
Not full, gotta get it in, get it? get us dinner
Violators tryna finish any little sentence, we will sentence sinners
It all stinks, but where we live is where the set's sinkin'
They say sorry son accept it, same old song of the subjectors
Sorry sirs, but we don't sing along to anthems or your pledges
In your garbage rose the rulers of the restless, do not test us
