[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Yeah P, yeah
You don't want to fuck with me, up in the cyph'
I'll make you go the fuck home and rethink your life
We're on a mission tonight, sick with the flow
Underground paper chase, flipping the dough
Immortal Technique sits on a throne of bones
That belong to little kids that were stolen from home
My open-air concerts are destroying the ozone
Creating tumors on the side of your head like cell-phones
You motherfuckers are clones, but I'm the original
The prototype for the most psychotic individuals
Clinical studies prove that fucking with me can be bloody
I used to keep a straight razor in the back of my cubby
Now i em on me to scarface you and your buddy
I can look into your soul whether you hate me or love me
That's why i think some of the most beautiful people are ugly
Corrupted by money, drowning in a bottle of bubbly
It's because of me that your army retreats in disgrace
Your people love you but not enough to die in your place
I use Chinese philosophies to murder the case
The sound of one hand clapping, is my gat in your face
Your foundation got cracks in the base like a dope fiend
Choking your broken dreams in a spy-hunter smoke screen
I got no respect, raw dog stoking your queen
Jerking off while I'm laughing because my jokes are obscene
None of your team can measure up to the shit that i'm spitting
?...scriptin' to composition
Golden shower your girl because i don't got a pot to piss in
Tech, Mac Lethal, El-P stay on the mission (ha,ha,ha)
So shut the fuck up and listen
