[Intro/Spoken]
I've wanted to fuck you since we were, like, twelve
An' I didn't know what to do
How was I supposed to tell them I was sleepin with ya mom who was in tears
For, like, the past three years
It's not even worth it anymore

[Bigg Jus - *scratched*]
Inhuman

[Bigg Jus]
And it's on like that {*repeat 3X*}
We inhuman on the track
Bigg Jus, El-P, check it (here's what I want you to do)

Yo, Mike L-A-D-D
Bigg Jus and E-L-dash-P
Two thousand and twelve AD
Motherfuckin death machines
Bounty hunter gunner with blade runner
Thirty-aught medula toolie
Smoke the dust free proof
Mind matter fusin' with the bug protrusion
I saw this mixed delicacy weaving across the room full of imposters
Full lips with the thickness of a Loud artist roster
I was like yo I'm Bigg Jus I'm unpredictable with nitro proofs
Be swimmin' in glycerin and iodine ignitin' loops
Saw you across the room strokin that silky pussy
Yo, what kind of cat is that, a light grey eyed Persian?
Stuck her tongue in the air she giggled
We was in the M5 swervin
Shit talkin ideaology
She like starin me up and down pathologically
I'm thinkin gynaecology
Sayin her name was Ambrosia Anise but call me Annie, please
I like that old Foxy Brown song
Keep y'all niggas livin' on ya knees
Actually I got a MD in statistics from MIT
Place any square root in front of my optical
I can break that shit down to the smallest possible atom
Smashin' it
Plus got a fellowship grant in synthetic dynamics
Programming Nexus 6 brain fluid fools
Fourteen different reaction postures with like all types of moods
Two thousand and one test functions ensure the titties swing properly
Disease resistant circuitry
Plus suckin' dicks sloppily
I pulled out the non-directional wave transmitter vagina finder
Then hit it 'til the brain box burst with orgasmic seismic
The bitch backflipped and yoked me up in a Heimlich
Turned to me expressionless with a dead look in her eyes
Reached inside her body cavity
Pulled out the magnesium nine
Then dialed the 481 center for Armageddon
Not knowin' Bigg Jus impervious to shell wettin'

[Mike Ladd]
CEB, Blade Runner stee', it's all of us, you and me
Stuck in monopolies {*repeat 4X*}

[El-P]
Yo yo yo yo
My dwellin' functions dual functional purpose
It's less than on the surface
I roam with a worthless herd and blend in
A veteran with one definite endin'
Swift at alert, call me Nexus
My three member team attempted time-mendin'
My cellulite is flesh like your family at best
Broken down with an advanced combination of what man made and what man is
But why I wasn't told in advance but the plan is got me frantic
I can't handle this shit
Blade Runner steelo means death
Why don't we dance but shit on me baby
I'm a cruel joke
Givin' the people life just to live four years then get smoked
I'm positive I'm worth more than this treatment
But the other white meat squeals in secret
Your politics come directly from mono television speakers
Repeated frequent
Amongst the working class acted original but quite flaccid
You wouldn't recognise my Nexus 6 fonts
Detected nonchalant through my lack of pupil response
Dirty, desperate, unimpressed, separate, soldier soldered with circuitry
Contagion plainly bent to prevent me from gettin' older
My tears blend to where the rain went
Well blade baby, I'll run a contagion
Style gunners flip shit amazin'
Till death call me Deckard
I've seen slave ships off the shores of Orion fire blazin'...

[Mike Ladd]
CEB, Blade Runner stee', it's all of us, you and me, stuck in monopolies (x4)

Ineffectual elections are infectious in the twilight of megalopolis
The populace is gettin' off on this chaos
As it is perceived
Fifty milion suckers crawl on hands and knees
To worship and believe
At ATMs and psychic friends networks
But that surround us
As we do Babylon by bus
Straight to Rikers
Run by guns with cops that used to be Nazi bikers
Unemployed writers type up eulogies for freedom fighters
Gone Republican
Who's rubbin' them brain cells
I gots
Gridlocked in my city block
AKA cell block
Shellshocked
Got a lot from Atlanta to Woodstock, Boston to Washington
New York's just downtown mega city one
Guns are like jewelry
I'm carryin' tomfoolery
I'm soothin' me with over information
And loopety loops pump through my veins
Like Thorazine in hula hoops
Must stay awake, can't sleep in hype and glamour
We live in the after-future, and that takes mad stamina
We be blazin' through stars like star blazin' shout lasers
And Luke Skywalker's a street walker in a kung fu suit
So let me be more like Sebastian
Have a passion for chess
Kick a pawn to King Four
No more than happiness
We be treated like replicants AKA refugees
Despised and lied to by Peter Jennings and Jack Cafferty
So bust a cap with me
Before they raffle me off at the police state fair
Everybody plays Pierre
Singin' "I don't care"

CEB, Blade Runner stee', it's all of us, you and me, stuck in monopolies {*repeat 4X*}
