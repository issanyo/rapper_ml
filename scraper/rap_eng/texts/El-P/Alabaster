Ragged raglan, rapid braggin, black kid rappin oh yeah of course you're one of a kind
Uhm
Body baggin, booty taggin, rupee snagging before y'all even knew i could rhyme
It's your favorite flagrant vagrant tripping off vegas
And dicking the fakers in ya ear with mad flavor merely...rad lava spitted fast witted
And fast wit it flow leave you frostbitten like bad mittens
All over the net like badminton
I heard your tape and it was bad written
Listen sonny, i'm makin hits like sonny liston sippin a lipton
Lips on a lit one -- tongue slip puns flip full clip nigga
Y'all know how i did it ascetic done spitted acidic from here to pacific
Split a critic like cigarillo with that swiss all up in it
Don't make me quit that splend.d shit and come at niggas specific

Smoke a sack cause my dudes say i need to relax
But like a black girl's hair, i need tracks + tracks
I hate when niggas always talking bout how their shit slaps
But their rhymes come up shorter than my Chaps
Fuck y'all niggas

Lampin on my lonesome
Lapped up in the loan sum
Seize your bitches quick i'm yung corpus callosum
Squeeze the trigger slick i'm numb off mimosas
Breathe in like a zip and mumble off some quotes uhh
Gather em in the gallows
Countin finger with callous
Careless rollin up cali while you're  combin your cowlick
I cleaned the codeine, fammy dreamin bout dakotee fanning
Coated in some coogi
Come and top me in my bottom jammies
Caught em with the bob and weave
I got more whores than your momma weave
Go'n watch me rise like i'm condaleez on ganja leaves
Kinda lenie in person but dont perpetrate on purpose
You know that i'm off the wall, i'll strangle you with the curtains
