Fuckin' everyone!

[Verse 1: Vents]
A lot of mouths need feeding
The good die young, the rest keep breathing
Scheming, sleep till I wake up screaming
Still tryin' to even the score for leaving
Knee-deep in the world of freedom
Where the food'll kill you and the girls are scheming, "Watch Out"
My mother said "love 'em or leave 'em"
And most guys waited for the right one to bleed in
Try – we were taught young, we don't cry
Keep it all bottled up until someone die
Livin' day to day, another week go by
Till the weekend come, man, we so high
We don't die, girls like Neo might
Used to tell me "fuck off" now, he so fly
Fuck 'em, spent my life eating humble pie
Now, I'm reaching for the fuckin' sky

[Hook: Vents]
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
I've got one life aside of this game
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
'Cause we got to get better, got to get tougher
Got to get smarter, got to get rougher
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
There is no pilot drivin' this–this–

[Verse 2: Vents]
Gotta keep on fighting, keep believing
We're not dying, we are breathing
I stop writing 'cause I've been grieving
And I've been silent but now I'm screaming
The test of a man, how he takes the beat and
Do not panic, use proper breathing
Keep bobbing, weaving, come on, duck the left hook
Do your own thing, fuck the textbook
Go jump in the lake of fire
Sayin' that the Vents ain't sick, you blatant liar
I am just a work in progress
And, whenever possible, barely conscious
Yep, straighten up and fly right
Me and my brain stayin' up till twilight
Plus, every mistake I made in hindsight
Was plenty of fun and I just begun

[Hook: Vents]
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
I've got one life aside of this game
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
'Cause we got to get better, got to get tougher
Got to get smarter, got to get rougher
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
I've got one life aside of this game
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
'Cause we got to get better, got to get tougher
Got to get smarter, got to get rougher
There is no pilot drivin' this plane
There is no pilot drivin' this–this–
