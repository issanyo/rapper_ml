You are now listening to the sounds of the weareallgoingtoburninhellmegamix!!!

[Hook x2]
2109 time to get shit straight
The farther from the city you run, the less fun
Even in the rubble son, test your fate
The closer to the city we get, the more guns

(start your fucking bike up)

[Verse 1]
Yo, I came closer to death than life to my liking
Closer than Kaneda raiding all these vikings
Flashing on clowns excites me
We've got them cornered by the alley greased lightning
I'm in a frame with the high octane shit
I'm peeling out motocross rival gang shit
And in the city the roads are like veins split
And I'm a clot running hot and dangerous
Out on the strip where my clique was aimless
At 110 MPH I'm famous
Brainless face where makeup takes it
Not a baller clown nose bitch to the pavement
Me and my squad of punks and fly rascals
Gunning the mecha up getting high on capsules
Maybe it's cause there's no love, just fragments
So blame it on society for raising these bastards
Matter of fact, blame it on hot red jackets
Holographic rims and bitches who love fast kits
I'm on blast trying to smash through traffic
And signal to Tetsuo to distract the dragnet
Digital break pads contract elaborate
A magnet for lost cause cats who want action
You just ran across clash contractions
Classism hatched in the form of fat traction

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
You're dead dummy, don't drive I'm too dangerous
The red writing outside your face plate stinks
Come on dog, let's go we got brains split
Open rolling fast lane agenda: to game the sick
Be prepared colonel
Bum foot on the handlebars
Balancing act time to flash
Don't be scared colonel
We're hopping up rigs doing a buck twenty hoping to crash
Correct that, all hope's in the past
In a city of reduction to dust from big blast
And thirty one years later fate laughs
In the form of speed demons who fuck death in ass
Like "Fuck death, I'm breathlessly fast
And the rest of these cats jaws is technically glass
See, I was harassed, disrespected in class
But I'm a rider now, hungry for violence not cash"
