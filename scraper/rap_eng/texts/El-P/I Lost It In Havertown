[Verse 1]
Here's the scenery, leisurely walking eagerly
Just departed some friends and some drinks in the eatery
I got a make out session and 2 O'clock, she's grilling me
Slight understatement to say she's really feeling me
She put her hand on my waist tasted perfume in the doorway
Body language is everywhere, I guess this is your day
She's either scorned or she suffers from a disorder too
Many lines to cross but our mental states don't border

[Hook]
Don't know what you were thinking, I'm so on the brink
And needing something that we can
Someone to keep and what you're doing is speaking
Your tongue in your cheek and your adorable weeping
Your water can leak in
Fill up the room as soon as I'm stuck in the deep end
I cling to a beacon, I was sinking my teeth in
I flew from your region, left you some of my demons
You were some sort of treatment or something else

[Verse 2]
She is seeing Evel Knievel of charm, no equal
I crashed already, jump in my eagle to meet you
Her tongue slowly passes her lips like a sharks fin
I'm in troubled waters now, heart bleeding, she's starving
Her feelings got deeper into me, look what you did to me
Nothin' a scientist, a pint of piss in chemistry
We could sip from a V-8, bitching about what we hate
You'll probably offend me by then trying to relate

[Hook]
Don't know what you were thinking, I'm so on the brink
And needing something that we can
Someone to keep and what you're doing is speaking
Your tongue in your cheek and your adorable weeping
Your water can leak in
Fill up the room as soon as I'm stuck in the deep end
I cling to a beacon, I was sinking my teeth in
I flew from your region, left you some of my demons
You were some sort of treatment or something else
