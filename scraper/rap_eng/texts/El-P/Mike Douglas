Is there anybody out there?

[Hook x2]
When they said New York is dead
Man, they got in your head
We don't even sleep right
There's too much to be said

[Verse]
Listen, I'd rather have it and not need it
Than need it and not have it
Better yet, dodging a screeching getaway
Vehic cannot catch it
Humbly submitted my sentence
Sentenced remit those busted BK talk captured
Like, "pardon me for the graphics"
While I'm plastered to the pavement
And wrapped in the wrong fabric
A kind of lecherous mind and I'm chimed to the automatic
Maybe I'm wrong
But I think there's more to this song than a couple suicide planes
From Allahu Akbar
Whatever you wasted the tone
Yeah, keep the crack raps up
That shit is double plus "whatever the fuck"
Everybody's afraid to say that it just sucks
To watch talented mother fuckers pretending they sell drugs
And the white journalists love it, they think it defines black
Like murder and pain is kitschy and rap is good for a laugh
Shit, I don't want to have to be the cat who has to explain
And come crass with another lecture
I'd rather fucking relax (Let's be honest)
Nobody really likes the dude who enters the room
And shows you your own ass
But fuck it, those are the facts
It's like the edu-mucated writers amused by another class
But could never suffer the results of the poison they helped hatch
All of us just collapse or detach to find another microfad fast
How can your style under that circumstance last?

[Hook x2]
