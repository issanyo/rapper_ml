[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
A warrior, my story glory-bound and war-renowned
Amongst the poor, the sick, and shut-eye where my story found
I overcame every obstacle that's every placed
The gods have promised, victory will one day know my face
Won't be denied the pride, won't be denied my prize
RTJ all day, any day, everyday 'round here
Beat you and these other guys
Don't know, don't care, don't really give a fuck
So long as they know don't fuck with mine
And let it be known, and truth be shone
We kill shit dead, no compromise

[Verse 2: El-P & Killer Mike]
El-Product on that wild boy stuff, spittin' dust
Pain and rain, we know angels dump
El-Tornado on all y'all chumps
This that run and bump
That fee-fi-fo-fum, attack and smack a chump
This that killer spit
That villainous, vicious, venomous El-Tornado kick (kick, kick, kick)
Don't doubt, we will mow down you dogs
No clout to spend here at all, we will now clown you all
Go shout it to the gods, "RTJ's arrived
To make your minion cry!", burn our image in 'er eyes
Better get a little bit of that zen shit in ya
I'm a long hitter, but I'll foul the fuck outta frog rap dinner
How the fuck El-Produc' get bigger, better, meaner?
Living like a sinner, mean demeanor
Either bleed or scream to me "Leader!"
Back to the ether (ether, ether, ether)

[Outro: El-P & Killer Mike]
Bigger, better, meaner
Ain't no days off, 'til the very last breath
Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, better, better, meaner, meaner
Ain't no days off, 'til the very last breath, movin', movin' like a
Bigger, better, meaner
Ain't no days off, movin', movin', movin', movin' like a boss
Movin', movin', movin', movin', movin' like a boss
'Til the, 'til the, 'til the very last breath
Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, better, meaner
'Til the, 'til the, 'til the, 'til the very last breath
Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger
Better, better, meaner, meaner, meaner 'til the very last breath
Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger 'til the very last breath
Better, better, better, better 'til the very last breath
Meaner, meaner, meaner, meaner 'til the very last breath
Ain't, ain't, ain't, ain't, ain't no days off, days off, days off
