Do you know who you are..

Do you know who you are fucking with?

Do you know, the access, to weapons, money and power

That we have? We will fucking kill you!

I'm the ugliest version of passed down toxic capitalist

Rapid emcee perversion -- I'm America!

Your bleeding-heart liberal drivel gets squashed

Wash em with sterilized rhyme patriot-guided weaponry bomb

From the makers of the devious hearts -- I'm America!

You bitchy little dogs don't even phase my basic policy

The bomb's smarter, my Ronald Reagan's crush Carter

With Bay of Pig tactics makin young men into martyrs

(Come on down!) Come to my happy promised land

Smiley faced opportunity cypher

And jump on the CoFlow pension plan

A proletariat, crushing State of the Union

Between serpentine words and mass confusion

Of media controlled blurb advertising disillusionment

Your family will love my low-rent, low-life

No-brain, reality-dagger, MOVEMENT

Hop over the border for amusement; try to test the waters

That the other slaughter crews pay all they dues in

You up against -- Jesus Freak, formin corporations in Young Republicans

Indelible NATO force hidden agenda, puppet governments

I'm lovin it! Keep the people guessin who I'm runnin with

Control the population and hide behind sacred covenants

Fuckin with me?!?! Means liberal wildlife burnin, gasoline seized

And an automagnetic third world printed with metal plates in they knees

Can't you hear the disenchanted, hide the scream of

Gabriel's reflected new wind instrument of judgment played in flat C

I replace humans like robots in a GM factory (warning! warning!)

Then export metaphors to sweat shops, cause the price is satisfactory

Your pious little cries of injustice get met with apathy

(Awww, SHUT UP!!) Soak, cloak, hormone injected dairy product

And conservative right-wing anti-eroticism; the poisonous

Resevoirs and power lines in your neighborhood cause botchilism

SENSELESS! Join the census, censorship sentences sentence

Triple-felon citizen paid pennance!

Dissension against C-F ends in, penetentiary residence

Lock em up first, then ask questions

Omniscient presence, my CHARM is the weapon

With cameras mics and satellites that leave privacy breathless

You don't even know the chemicals you've ingested

Urine tested -- BEAT INNOCENT MAN 'TIL HE CONFESSES

"Who's America? Who's America? Who's America? Who's America?"

"Who's America? Who's America? Who's America? Who's America?"

I'm America! I'm America! I'm America! get busy on em!

"God damn!!"

I'm America arrogant!! Terminus verbal curfew murders

You either purchase my products or you're worthless, that's my service!

Don't look into the oculars of a daylight saver

Eraser, city-headed momument defacer comprising of

Patriot droids, sent into the void with lead linings

Employed by the bureaucrats of automatic twisted rhyme timing

You're guaranteed nothing but my fat little finger

That lingers one inch off of the big button -- LET'S START THIS!

I'm Saran gas, hide in your apartments

I'm stealth like a robot hidden in the fat asshole of Cartman

And give a crippling fuck like sand sharkskin condom

To your apparent vaginal problem - the hottest shit on Soundbombing

I'm American til infinite justice measure to Pesticide Cemetary

Invite you to cross the border then SHIT on your divinities

What language is that? I'm angusih in fact, tangle with a

Star-spangled standard issue gat for crowd management

Talk loud and get enshrouded in a hot cloud of harassment

By the crowd force of my mental pedestrian checker

That smashes subordinate skulls and update the file in your dental records

You tryin to get elected but the crowd is my paid hecklers (BOO! BOO!)

You just stepped into the spectrum of paranoid word rainbow

Thinkin you sick with a sihlouette, burn transit cop out his plain clothes

I'm America!! This is where the pain grows like poppies

In a Field of Dreams I paid for, I'll burn it down if operated sloppily

COPY? My economic sanction rhyme style got your syllables

Scraping for rice and riding in a pre-1960 jalopy

My favorite flavour of gas is mustard

I'm fuckin a blind hermaphrodite icon and convincin you that it's justice!

"Who's America? Who's America? Who's America? Who's America?"

"God damn!!"

Treason will not be tolerated!

You have been enlisted.. into a lifestyle that you may not change!

Understand! You can't be happy.. and smile.. for the cameras!

MotherFUCKER!
