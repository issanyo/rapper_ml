(Breathe in the sun)

[Akrobatik]
Damn, what does my calendar date say
I can see my breathe outside and it's late May
This is not condusive to a great day
Man I wanna (breathe in the sun...)
Yeah, I just wanna sleep the night away
Wake up, and go outside to see a brighter day
Not where I can get around to it, but right away
I always said I'd leave the city I love
And wherever I was meant to be I'm always thinking of
Been in the same city my whole life
And still no wife, it's time for Ak to get his groove back
And maybe if I bounce, it'll just prove that
This is where I've always needed to be
And then I'll move back
Word, and now it's time for me to expand
And it ain't about the music cause I got my own fans
Yeah, I toured the world and it was part of my plan
But now I need a couple months to chill out in the hot sand
Watch my lady hit that dope perplexion of honey brown
Drop the top, hit the water and run around
Maybe I can clear my head in the sun rays
And live how Roy Aidens used to talk about one day
Tired of being surrounded by the drugs and the gunplay
I'll promise I'll be back, but for now big Ak got to

Before your sanity's gone
Instead of stressing over something from night to mourn
Sometimes the only thing you got to do is move on
And (breathe in the sun)
Yeah, before your sanity's gone
Instead of stressing over something from night to mourn
Sometimes the only thing you got to do is move on

[Mr. Lif]
When we met in the beggining I would've never have thought
That we would've never been caught in such an intricate plot
You posessed all the things I have sought
Intelligence, grace, a beautiful face, benevolent heart
Who's to blame when people choose goals that oppose
Though they're kindred souls, yet they can't find time to grow
I know you holding me into a better man
Help me find a point in life to help me strengthen my plans
And I tried all these things I never knew
My abilities grew because I loved you
Over clouds I flew
But I landed in my own sorrow
Brought you tears today
I must say, I'll see you crying tomorrow
And I can conjure over a million selfish reasons to stay
But I know we'll never grow that way
So I'm letting you go
Although I truely don't believe that we're done
In my heart I've always felt that you were number 1
Now you can (breathe in the sun)

You've been my love, my joy, my guided light
But I'm not the type, to stick around if I ain't treating you right
So you should (breathe in the sun)
So I think we should leave before we tarnish what we have together
Our bond is hard to severe
I'll hold you in my heart forever while you (breathe in the sun)
