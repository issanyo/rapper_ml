I want to thank you for listening to this mix
I know it seems kind of bleak
And I don't mean to get corny or sentimental
But it's real possible that we might come out on the other end of this shit
We might actually become something different
In fact I think that's exactly what's going to happen
Some of us might not make it there, some of us will
Point being, stand on your two fucking feet
