There's a difference between graf writers
Don't think we're all the same
Some catch tags for name (born undisputed king)
(fifty across your face *swish swish*)
Some for the art
And some just for mass destruction
(Look I say we go to war with the Bammer Squad man)
(We sets it off TONIGHT~!)
(We gonna do state buildings, federal buildings, and government buildings)
(Motherfuckin Gracie Mansion man)
Yo hittin up tags up police cars B!

Even when I'm 80 years old
I'ma still be catchin tags on the walls in the old folks home
(Now check this out man, graffiti is like, that's my thing)

(One tag, y'knahmean, quittin graffiti, you'd have to kill me first...)
