Right in your head ohhh
Tell me if you want to fight
Cause I didn't let chu go out tonight
Ruined your life
Baby
We are all alone
Body feel like its gone
And you're on that stuff
All alone
Pop a pill yeah
She won't even pick up the phone
Don't call me at home
I said
Baby , why you all alone ?
Needing me to come over and show you how lovin is done
How love is yeah
Mommas here
Maybe you're scared, I don't know
What the fuck is going on ?
Brain feeling like its gone

Everybody say yeahh yeahhh
Ohh ohh
One of these days, you're gonna cut your wrists, and I'll﻿ bring you to a toilet
A hot fix
Love..... love love love

One of these days, you're gonna cut your wrists, and I'll﻿ bring you to a toilet
A hot fix

You say momma
Baby
Why you so lonely tonight ?
Hit the streets ready to fight
Ready to riot all night

Drugged up on a monday night

You's a rebel and you don't like all alone
Spending money at the bar
Now you're hopping into brand new cars
All alone
Maybe you're scared, I don't know

Wild tonight with her friends
Don't want to hear nothing
Give me some ends
I say here take this cash
Does it make any sense
To want to lose your life

Do it
I say do it
Do it
We love you now
Do it

Listen to your friends
Spend couple of ends
One of these days, you're gonna cut your wrists, and I'll﻿ bring you to a toilet
A hot fix
Love..... love love love
What the fuck is going do oh
Whether you arrive
Oh baby your life
Is more precious than anything that we could possibly think of, girl

Baby you too all alone
Can't even pick up the phone
Phone
Phone
Hey yeah yeah
Love..... love love love
Now everybody say yeah
Come on with me
Let me show you
Love..... love love love
You all alone
You all alone
Nobodys on the phone
On the phone
