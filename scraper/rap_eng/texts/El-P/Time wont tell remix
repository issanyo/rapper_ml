[Intro]
Man crawled from the mud
Man crawled from the mud and saw god
Man crawled from the mud and saw god, and god said get the fuck off my lawn nigga
Man crawled from the said and saw god, and god said get the fuck off my lawn
Now let here be light
Man crawled from the mud and saw god, get the fuck off my law nigga
Now let there be light heartedness, and let me learn you all what an artists is

[Verse – Nocando]
Fuck hope man, its pain in these brush strokes
It ain't a love boat, even the nice guys are cutthroat
I stuck my neck out there on some Jurass shit
My head hit the ground hard like giraffe shit
The future of the past, a soon to be has-been
It's good, I just need one bad bitch to laugh with (yeah)
My friends said it would be the end of our era soon
We should trade our Nissan’s in for hot air balloons (what)
Great discussion, couldn't hate for nothing
It sounded silly but at least he got faith in something
I just believe in a dollar and my dick
Guns, germs and steel, baby thoughts are for the rich
Blue collar stiff, so motherfucking working class
I get paid to be a reactionary frustrated jerking crass
Personified pistol with my draws no shirt and pants
Hindsight 20/20 my rear views got a perfect pass(past)
While all these kids is worried about their swag
My thoughts an innovation(are) in a hostage situation (yeah)
We see the money let em’ free, bleed a country
Keep it coming, keep it a hundred and keep the engine running (ah)
You don’t know my name yet, its Nocando
Hellfyre Club, it ain't a gang or a crew
El-P on the track, birds on the wire, proverbial roof is all motherfuckin fire

[Hook]
We don’t need no water (x3)
Let that motherfucker burn
Let it burn, let it let it burn
Let it, let it let it burn, let it let it burn
We don’t need no water (x3)
Let that motherfucker burn
Let it burn, let it let it burn
Let it, let it let it burn, let it let it burn

[Outro]
Nocando, El Producto
Hellfyre Club in
LA to NY everywhere in between
Everyone on the outside ??? mix
That’s all folks
Let that motherfucker burn like
