[Verse 1]
Hello, Fresh. Welcome home. This is home plate, stage
Murder breath, one, I, solo step. Bring it
El Product, in to duck, snuggle in, tight fight
This is, what? Something to define me, baby
Running man, run quick, scissor sticks, spray out
Look into semantics, man, look into them closely
Most host parasite
Eve of the title fight
Someone took a dive tonight
Follow where the money goes
Sick as this, money makes love thunk cardiac money black heart thump
Make me punch faces
Pervert kings stood behind the curtain for the blade stick
Some might stand above that
Numbers, dull worth thought
I control no one
Radio control's dead
Major Tom up creek
Calling ground control, what?
A bitch's slave whore port control weak weaponry
Fits the grave floor board to bug dead enemies
Leaflet family branches get madded in lung compartments
Sorry to leave this past my direction, I been ignored
I've seen phones with ceaseless animatronic cature buttons rusted in the on position
Trigger metal detectors at the door
This is for the single maternal figures beaten to the floor
And crawled back for the children and stood up for more
And watched those same kids as adults
Got bullshit vinyl kites call their women whores
Joust with junkies flounce boots with Velcro flunkies
How cute, how to shoot, ball wreckers
Off the record, I took the needle off your record
You spit that feeble plea tell shit that you're hungry
I replied that I didn't find it funky
Enough mechanisms tackle bigger hungers
Without bets in a Billy Crystal sulk moments
I'm open for the exorcism strictly by the prime numbers
To redesign your small wonder

[Hook]
Pisces 1, Scorpio, alert of destruct
Constellation funk (constellation funk)
The same light over your head just passed
Alert of destruct (alert of destruct)

[Verse 2]
Your revolution is young with a strange fragrance
Vacuum sealed piety working for corporations
Life is complicated
I know activists that pour their heart out to an audience that's completely fucking complacent
God forbid we catch you back stage being human
Public image limited to the purity of your movement
Rap is quite confusing
I know white rappers who claim they're more artistic and advanced than the inner city tune is
Now you're fucked up and can't move units
Cause you know nothing of the culture that created hip-hop music
Stuck in an authenticity contest with a bunch of cats that grew up in the exact same way that you did
Now where do you fit?
I'm talking centipede, that shit that slides on its dirty ab pack
Dirty, deaf, fretless bass pipe
Don't believe the hype, don't act fugazi
Don't tell me the rules, I'm the ruler
And I'm motherfucking crazy
Anti dib essential cannibal
With do some mandibles, don't touch down like diagonal afterburners collecting a loveless infant
And you wonder why such tactical, radical rounding animal-sounding selection's competitive with your mission?
We steep with veteran sense in our refinement
We see the beauty in chaos and misdirection
We love a brutal and passionate human lusting
We pet our women with tongues in their anal crevice
See I'm a man for what it's worth, and I do love it
My family grew up without manhood in its structure
And we were stronger for that fact, I do believe so
We held our own against some fucking evil people
And now I'm grown and I still can't protect my sister
But I know she has her mother's strength within her
And maybe I can tap that strength and flirt with greatness
Expose these alcoholic stepfathers and rapists!
The doors close, you lose in my eyes, one live
I suppose you can melt now scorpio
Melt away scorpio, down your hole
Down your hole, down your hole

[Hook]
Pisces 1 scorpio alert of destruct
Constellation funk (constellation funk)
The same light over your head just passed
Alert of destruct (alert of destruct)

Pisces 1 scorpio alert of destruct
Constellation funk (constellation funk)
The same light over your head just passed
Alert of destruct (alert of destruct)
