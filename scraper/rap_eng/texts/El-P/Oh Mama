[Verse 1: Killer Mike & El-P]
Gun in the holster be
Right in the upholstery
Somewhere right close to me
Just in case the rollers be
Rolling on the G
My woman keep it in the hosiery
I'm known in my town
In those strips where high-rollers be
I'm up early, where the money folders sippin' Folgers be
A country boy chilling in Brooklyn like Lefty spoke for me
Fuck with us
You fuck with the truth, we speak openly
Never a rat, like Donnie Brasco, though
Cause there ain't no hoe in me

[Verse 2: El-P & Killer Mike]
"Notice me, senpai!" they cry when I choke their speak
I'll set this crooked city on fire to light the smokery
Old timers speak of us hushed and clutch their rosaries
I lust after greatness, I'm aiming right at its ovaries
Better run from the future palooka (haul off)
You acting like it's safe when the revolution's been (called off)
There's liars on the loose, if we listen to you we're (all lost)
The takers of the jewels never singing a tune at (all soft)

[Hook: El-P]
My mama said that I'm not living right
She said, "I'm crying on you"
She said, "I waited up for you all night"
I said, "I'm trying mama"
My mama said that I'm not living right
She said, "I'm crying on you"
She said, "I waited up for you all night"
I said, "I'm trying mama"

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
I smoke the holy herb, get high as hell and meditate
Swear to God, shit's so good, fat boy'll levitate
God gift to man, how the fuck they try to legislate
Mom's, she recovering, tell me I over-medicate
I tell her, "Holy fuck, Jesus Christ, give me a fucking break"
She said, "Don't curse your mama, goddammit," and threw a dinner plate (damn)

[Verse 4: El-P]
I heard it in Brooklyn where all the sinners stay
You running out of ways to go fuck yourself, I will innovate
The skin of your shitty grin will disintegrate
Every sickening sentence'll cheapen them tricks you venerate
Set the phaser to face-plate-incinerate
Run the Jewels, run with the Borg, baby, assimilate

[Hook: El-P & Killer Mike]
My mama said that I'm not living right
She said, "I'm crying on you"
She said, "I waited up for you all night"
I said, "I'm trying mama"
My mama said that I'm not living right
She said, "I'm crying on you"
She said, "I waited up for you all night"
I said, "I'm trying mama"
My mama said that I'm not living right
They want us dying, mama
My mama said that I'm not living right
But I ain't crying, mama
My mama said that I'm not living right
You raised a lion, mama
I ain't lying, mama
My mama said that I'm not living right
I said, "I'm trying mama"
I'm crying on you, crying on you
I said, "I'm trying mama"
