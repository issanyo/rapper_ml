[Intro:Redman]
Woah,uhh, get your blunts in the air and get to smoking it
And uhh, passing it around and shit cuz this is Gilla House
Big ups to them Detroit niggas: D12, Eminem (get high mayne)
Royce Da 5'9", Trick Trick, and them goons
This goes out to Proof, baaabbbby

[Verse 1]
Reg Noble, role up in the blue volvo
I rock polo my face like Miguel Cotto
I'm serious, pour the Cranberry with the remy
Impersonate you rappers more than Milli-Vanilli
I'm higher than the drug dealer you got your weed from
You rappers won't impress me till' you learn to make an album
So quit it fall back cause I got the power, its music, money, hoes
Plus blunts of the Sour, my name is Reggy Noble I'm a sexaholic
I fuck my baby sitter on my mama toilet,I'm a kon artist
Like the homie from D12 niggas think I ain't strapped
Until they hear the shells bitch I'm coming out shooting
Thru the window, in the car chase you gettin' shot the fuck up like Scarface
I started rolling blunts my mind is getting open
My pen is like Cheech and Chong I'm still smoking

[Hook]
So when you see me in your city high as hell
And I'm dancing like Diddy I just don't give a fuck
Smoking the sour in the drop with the homie and he holding on the Glock
Sayin I just don't give a fuck
So if you don't follow me on the Twitter I ain't bitter fuck you niggas
I just don't give a fuck
When you see me on the streets run
Cause most likely Red got a gun
I just don't give a fuck

I'm poppin' the E, but I'm looking for MDMA
With a double barrel, bumping NWA
I hustle hard for the guap around any season
Thats why my rims beeming where the parking meter reading
Beefing, your all Vegan, you wouldn't beat a case
You're the type to snitch the first hour, first 48
Never needed a cape, I'm a lyrical hero
Doctor, the Psycho ward gave me a referral
When I form like Wu-Tang in the street with the heat of DiNero
Redman's the coolest, Reggie Noble's a weirdo
With your wife eating the beaver
Skeet on her lips looking like Missy Misdemeanor
The dirtiest rhymer, marijuana addict, the legend, icon
Gorilla, classic, half alien, half bro I'm the type of asshole
To cut your girls fake breast with a knife as big as Rambo's

[Hook]
So when you see me in your city high as hell
And I'm dancing like Diddy I just don't give a fuck
Smoking the sour in the drop with the homie and he holding on the Glock
Sayin I just don't give a fuck
So if you don't follow me on the Twitter I ain't bitter fuck you niggas
I just don't give a fuck
When you see me on the streets run
Cause most likely Red got a gun
I just don't give a fuck
