The motherfuckin saga continues...

[Intro]
Yeah, turn me up some on the mic some (1, 2, 1, 2...)
Yeah, Turn it down overall in the headphones

[Verse]
Yo, we go one for the money, two for the show
Three for Brick City, four for Bang Bro
This the count down, bang the underground
Bang a hundred rounds, nigga you want it down
I can't believe they givin air for these cats to breathe
But Ima dog, and I sniff between
I glow like the sun, but run in the nite
Doc'll bend you quick, like the front of your Nikes
Redman, I make my 929 can-can
And if you can't' stand the pressure, slam dance
Def Jam lost they soul
They forgot how to build a artist, so I gotta show 'em
Gilla House, you let the real gorilla out
The Pit Boss of the game is how I deal 'em out
Yall philosophy is wrong, it's to the +left+
So gimme fifty G's lemme +right+ (write) your songs

[Bridge]
The motherfuckin saga continues...
The motherfuckin saga continues...
The motherfuckin saga continues...
The motherfuckin saga continues...

[Verse 2]
Long as Rockwilder and E. Sermon got my back
I don't need to pick up tracks
I choose to do it
I'm fluent, I crack it to the rooster roostin
This for carjackers, and boosters boostin
Duck nigga, fuck ya Cadillac truck pick-up
I roll Sanford and Son when cameras come
I'm Gilla, I do it red-handed and run
Write my scripture in the Bible, hand it to nuns
I'm keepin a green thumb
Me and my man Tical, Four, Voltron and Team One
Smoke addicts, when the mic on we toe tag it
My Go-go Gadget, go smack bastards
Rap like Ceramic
Doc Slept on a bed of bricks, yall takin flicks on a hammack
And In my head, I can hear Jam Master jammin
I'm the Brick Layer, I'm the Brick Mayor
Doctor Dictator, put ya gun and switchblade up
Gilla House, wakin up your neighbors
Keep my family tight like Will Smith and Jada
FYI, I'm back on the job, BITCH!

[Hook x2]
(10...9...8!!!)
Motherfuckers better hit the gate, we go...
(7...6...5!!!)
Gilla house gon keep it alive, we go...
(4...3...2!!!)
I got bitches like "Who that dude!?"
(One!) I'm number one
(One!) I'm number one
(One!) I'm number one
