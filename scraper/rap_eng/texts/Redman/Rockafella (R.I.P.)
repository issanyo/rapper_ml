Sat down and opened my mind and said it's time
For me to design the right lines
Make the one of a kind raw, rough and tough and all that stuff
Sho' nuff I'm makin' brother's change their minds
Then you understand my only principle
No need to fuck with the born invincible
I'm rated X like a porno feature
Leaving MC's dazed, and catching anesthesias
Even females get rocked when they try to cock block
The man from doing this hip-hop
Techniques unique and that's my word is bond
Rockafella's the name but they screaming out rock on
