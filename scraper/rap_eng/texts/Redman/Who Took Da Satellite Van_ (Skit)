Once again in the Bricks, Chris Tricarico formerly of W-ah-Fuck Y’all Radio
Where I find myself in somewhat of a pickle
As you know, my satellite van was recently stolen
And uh..hold up, I see some shady types over on that corner
I could probably score some—hey, hey buddy
Would you fellas know where I could get my hands on some peep, do they call it?

[Redman]
Peep? Man, this pep, muthafucka

[Reporter]
Oh, right, right, pep, pep
Um, I was instructed to go to a little house or a little condo
Would you know where that is?

[Redman]
Man, it’s Little Bricks, nigga

[Reporter]
Oh, that’s it, that’s it, Little Bricks, Little Bricks, right

[Redman]
Nigga, you still here?

*shooting*

Chris Tricarico, W-Fuck-Y’all Radio, I’m outta here
