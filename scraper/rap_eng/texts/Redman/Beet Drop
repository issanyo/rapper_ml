Cover of the 2nd half of Beastie Boys' "The New Style"

Let me clear my throat!
Kick it over here Baby Pop!
And all the fly skimmers..
Feel the Beet.. mmmm drrrrrrrrop!

Coolin up in Jersey on a hot summer's day
It's me and Erick Sermon and, Keith Mur-ray
A lot of beer, a lot of girls, and a lot of CURSIN!
Forty-five automatic on my person
Yo, got my hand in my pocket and my finger on the trigger
My Squad is gettin BIG, and my Squad is gettin BIGGER!
Some niggas got style, some niggas got TASTE
Def Squad got the shit'll bash you in your FACE
Tote my gun with my nigga, tote my nigga with my gun
Hit a bitch doggie style, so wild, til she cum
Well I'm the king of the ave., and I'm the king of the block
Don't like what I'm pumpin? You can suck my cock!

Well I'm Funk Doc I got all the fly juice
Stankin with my niggas on the block one-deuce
Walkin down the block with the fresh fly threads
Reggie Noble got the biggest head

Oahhhahh, hoahhahh, hoahhhah, hoee!!!
Brick City nigga!
