Intro:
Uh, yeah. Comin' straight from the westside all the way to the eastside..
(ooh somethin' for the honeyz)

Verse 1:
I'm the type of guy who takes time to just kick back
I turn around my baseball cap
I have a 40 sittin' on my lap
Slammin' thee ivorys until I see
A famale worth my while
I scopin' it checkin' her smile
And I know that I can get it and I'll hit it if she's wit it
I get the five to the six seven digits
Call her up on my cellular
And all the shit that I'll say to her
The fun will begin when I hit the skins
So if a girly is lonesome
I think she knows were to goes if she wants some
Cause money ain't here for nothin' but I got a little...

Hook:
Somethin' for da honeyz (x2)

Verse 2:
Oooh summertime no funner time
For me to kick it with you
To find something or someone to get into
I call up my crew tell 'em to bring a brew
And some Henessy for the beach party
So call up your girlfriends and you know there tends
To be an ugly one
But bring her too
Fat or skinny she likes to shoop (shoop shoop)
With Montell in the S.L. Coupe
While the beat is bumpin'
For South Central to Compton a little somethin' somethin'
Could very well be the next Aaron Neville
Soundin' like nobody else cause I'm on another level
And you fellas can't dig it with a shovel (naw they can't)
But it ain't for you fool

Hook

Redman:
Yo I drop the bomb from Pacific to specific
While I sippin' on Dom Parrion and gettin' lifted
It's the Reggie Noble with my afro blown
I got it sewn, it's on till the cows come home
Son I keep the brothers on the run from the ghetto
Cause I'm a rude bwoy fellow so give me elbow
Room and I'll blow this track to the moon
If you're tuned I get your fiances in the mood
I took a trip out to Cali cause this is how we
Do this bomb Maui Wowie drunk funk for you ALKIES
Funk Doctor got it locked
I be flyer then the man who play it fly in car wash
So Montell crack the champell
And pass the el to the honey with the painted toes and fingernails
And Def Squad we don't here nothin'
Hittin' 15 on thee Rictor scale when it's bumpin'

Ooooh somethin' for the honeyz
Check it check it out word up
Ooooh somethin' for the honeyz
