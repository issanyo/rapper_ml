[Intro: Dj Scoob Doo]
Oh yeah, we live (Live from the Bricks)
Redman where you at, nigga?

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo, I'm on my grime money, fuck with ya boy
And beef, you're not raw, you're cult mixed with soy
My truck makin' noise, you can hear it in Virginia
I don't play, I even smack kids like Madea
You breathe ether, your whole area is strung
And pookie on the car like "Damn, he da chump"
I got his prom queen, carryin' my gun
For wack rappers, we be burying the bums like
You squeeze if you a buddha blast
But 'fuck you pay me, I'm a pain in the ass
This the driver-off, feet stankin' the cat
I pass for being an ass, I train in the class
Talk shit like Paul Mooney, hoping your job sue me
So I can turn your label part into Call of Duty
My lyrics like Hung Kung fuey, raw sushi
You get done, quicker than niggas in horror movies
When it comes to the Bricks, I'm the man to do it
The same muh-fucka Erick Sermon recruited
I'm busy like the con duet
I cop sixteen like a whore, I let I95 do it

[Chorus: Redman]
I run through your block nigga, and shut it down
My name is funk doc nigga, I shut em down
And Gilla won't stop nigga, we shut it down
We laughin' at you like 'hahahahahaha'
I roll through your block nigga, and shut it down
My name is funk doc nigga, I shut em down
And Gilla won't stop nigga, we shut it down
We laughin' at you like 'hahahahahaha'

[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo, yo, I keep a gutta flow, like the Stinger & Double O
Bronco fan, but after the bills like buffalo
You got a grill, I gotta steal your upper row
Call Paul Waller and let my bottoms dine in fo' sure
I'm all pro & y'all amateurs
I'm on the talking barbershop cameras, from here to Los Angeles
I manhandle shit boy, you can learn from it
Your blunts be the same size George Burns burnin'
I roll it up, light it up, then I do it dirty
I buy my weed like school's out, 2:30
Put it all in one L, then unveil to hoes
I'm half chinese, "My name is Hun Well"
The three best emcees, time to change that
Isabel, how far in the hood ya name stretch?
Or can you go back to your block and claim that
And be consecutive with albums like mine

[Chorus: Redman]
I run through your block nigga, and shut it down
My name is funk doc nigga, I shut em down
And Gilla won't stop nigga, we shut it down
We laughin' at you like 'hahahahahaha'
I run through your block nigga, and shut it down
My name is funk doc nigga, I shut em down
And Gilla won't stop nigga, we shut it down
We laughin' at you like 'hahahahahaha'

[Outro: Dj Scoob Doo]
Oh yeah, it feels good
