[Intro]
Yeah!
Yeah!
Ow!
Come one! Come on! Come on!

[Verse 1]
Check it out, I'm on 'em like (Yeah!)
Redman, Grammy nominated and I still feel I ain't made it
So I'm takin' over like (Yeah!)
I sweat and bleed gorilla DNA, banana clips
I serve 'em entrée, I'm in the jungle (Yeah!)
Like Nas brother, the chunkier bride brother, open your umbrella
Flows rainin' on 'em like (Yeah!), Bricks is where I got it from
I never practice Iverson
Admirin' a nigga, the way I do it (Yeah!)
I'm in Manhattan with my roof missin', lookin' like Simmons in the El Dorado Russell put me on (Yeah!)
We worldwide, my name tatted on your girl thigh (Let's go, nigga!)
With fire in my bones, I'm Jeremiah (Yeah!)
I love this rap game, just 'cause L frames on Dana Dane
Blame Red when your little kids say (Yeah!)
I got momentum, my Levi denim got purple in 'em
Cops start scufflin' 'em, 'cause I put in work

[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah!) Hip-hop got me feelin' real big (Come on, yeah!)
Hip-hop got me feelin' real broke (Come on, yeah!)
Hip-hop got me all around the world (Come on, Ha! Whooooo!)
Yeah, I told 'em that I'm—

[Chorus]
Un-bel-ievable
Un-bel-ievable (Yeah)
Un-bel-ievable
Un-bel-ievable (Yeah, I told 'em all that I'm—)
Un-bel-ievable (Let's go, nigga)
Un-bel-ievable (Yeah)
Un-bel-ievable

[Verse 2]
Yo, Red back again like (Yeah!)
You know the deal, it's not a joke when my boys take the key and peel (Rrrrrrr!)
I grill on 'em like (Yeah!)
I flex on 'em, fuck the world, don't ask me for shit that's parked to it
Biggie and Mef on it (Yeah!)
It's been a while, but when I drop, they all confile
But the white hearts they say my weed loud (Yeah!)
So nowadays, a gun to a nigga haircut, is how you shoot the fade
I'm pumped like triple A, nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah!) Hip-hop got me feelin' real big (Come on, yeah!)
Hip-hop got me feelin' real broke (Come on, yeah!)
Hip-hop got me all around the world (Come on, Ha! Whooooo!)
Yeah, I told 'em that I'm—

[Chorus]
Un-bel-ievable
Un-bel-ievable (Yeah)
Un-bel-ievable
Un-bel-ievable (Yeah, I told 'em all that I'm—)
Un-bel-ievable (Let's go, nigga)
Un-bel-ievable (Yeah)
Un-bel-ievable

[Outro]
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
