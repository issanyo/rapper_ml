[Intro]
Yeah… Yeuuh! I don’t know what you gonna do about this one man
Gilla
(We ain’t going out like this mothafucker!)

[Verse 1]
A-yo, something going on I’m strapped
I ain’t the one to be tiptoeing on and back
My getaway cars, so keep the motor warm relax
I’m ‘bout to fade niggas like corduroys and slacks
You know the drama I bring, devil piranha, suicidal Nirvana
Bomb like I was born from Osama’s mama
The ocean liner rhymer, I keep it afloat
My no goes workplace see who’s sleeping the most
Now I’m in NYC ready for a showdown
While the wolf got my weight up, face got no frown
I’m in a trench I see a punk getting close
So my right hand’s on my 357 straight from Oaktown
My bullets make ya hammer dance to the ambulance
Rock like the Duran Duran, Hanna Barbarian
Hot when I’m behind the pen, Doc’ll go man-to-man
Hoods raise up or feel shots like a cameraman

[Hook] X2
OHHH!! What the fuck is going on!?
How many motherfuckers on my back?
How many mo’fuckers I’m gon' have to clap?
It’s time to get up!

[Verse 2]
Yo, I’m pouring ash through the city
Like P. Diddy sent me for cheesecake
Yeah the cheese that come in a briefcase
Redman, Gilla House sell weed on Ebay
A man do what he want, a boy do what he says
So I’ll go get my gun, go and show my True Crime
Never scared, I walk in a joint like ‘Do summin’!’
I’ll move something, never stand around and wait for it
Anything I cake on it, same way that Jay own it
I’m tryna get back, hand on my click-clack
Southside to Northside, G.W. Bridge at
Shit getting ugly, I’m a Lion you a Kit-Kat
Beating meeting me, yo your baby mamas wouldn’t risk that
Think I’m laying down? NO! Zero on the ground flo'
Got them in that black gun, bullets gotta now go
Open up your brown nose, smell the underground DOPE!
Redman, True Crime, Gilla ensemble

[Hook] X4
OHHH!! What the fuck is going on!?
How many motherfuckers on my back?
How many mo’fucker I’m gon' have to clap?
It’s time to get up!

It’s time to get up, up, up!
