[Pink and (Redman)] [Intro]
(It cannot be)
Uh uh it is time to get the party started
Yeah, it is time to get the party started (Yeah, Killer)
Yeah, Rockwilder, Redman, and Pink (It cannot be)

[Redman] [Verse 1]
Yo, Funk Doc walk into the club acting rowdy
I am hounding for the right girl to crown me
Fuck a little bit up, lift you shirt a bit up
Get the gentlemen off, turn the temperature up
One blink turn the world around
Just one drink make you hurl it down
Who that there, we up here
You better like move back there if you that scared
Doctor, Pink let us happen to link
I am in the tuck bleeding to death, harassing the freak
(AHH!) I am back in the beat, happen to be ROCK!!!
Introducing, beat the underground make it shake upstairs
Women throw that shit till they make-up smears
Hit it, in my cup let us fire it up
Are you high or what

[Pink] [Verse 2]
Get the party started on a Saturday night
Everybody is waiting for me to arrive
Sending out the message to all of my friends
We will be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz
I got lots of style, got my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean, oh

[Chorus] [Pink w/ Redman ad-libs]
I am coming up
So you better you better get this party started
I am coming up
So you better you better get this party started

[Pink] [Verse 3]
Pumping up the volume, breaking down to the beat
Cruising through the Westside
We will be checking the scene
Boulevard is freaking as I am coming up fast
I will be burning rubber, you will be kissing my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car
License plate says "Stunner #1 Superstar"

[Chorus] [Pink w/ Redman ad-libs]

[Pink] [Verse 4]
Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree?
Travelled the world and the Seven Seas
Everybody get the party started
Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree?
Travelled the world and the Seven Seas
Everybody (Yeah, everybody looking looking looking')

[Redman] [Verse 5]
Yo, yo, yo everybody move, everybody jump
Everybody stomp the floor, get it crank
Everybody move, everybody jump
Everybody stomp the floor
It is Rock wilder, rock the house
Yo pink Diggy, rock the house
Yo Funk Doc, rock the house
Yo scream at you boy real loud girl

[Pink and Redman] [verse 6]
Get the party started ooh
Get this party started, right now
Get this party started
I am coming up (Yeah)

(Another Rock wilder production)
I am coming up (Ha, ha, ha)
I am coming up, I am coming up
I am coming up, going to get the party started
(Looking looking looking looking)
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to be abused
We just want to
