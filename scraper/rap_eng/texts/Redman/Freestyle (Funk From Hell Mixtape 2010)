I'll be that dammed motherfucka coming down with sax
Motherfuckers I'll be burning just like wet kotex
If you wanna beat me, the MC, the RAE
Next stop in this movie, gas, sweat, starring me
If you wanna chek my resume, yes I'm that type of nigga
That be breaking your bitches more than
I'm down with my man Ron G, me and K be sippin' on -----
What you gonna do? all you fake motherfuckers in the back
If you represent, then, let me hear your gun glow
One time up in the air, if you just don't stop
It's the never coming down, rubbing you for sex crabs
And bebop, real hip - hoppers
When ---- to this, you can't rock to this
MC wanna tears my steeze, I'll be putting holes
In your body, like your body was cheddar cheese
Now subliminal criminlas, I'll be dismolishing
MCs be waxing and polishing their rhymes
But I stay with the ruggedness, the toughness
