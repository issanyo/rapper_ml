Hands up if you wanna get high, yo
Hands up if you wanna get high, yea
Hands up if you wanna get high, yo
Hands up if you wanna get high, yea

[Verse 1: Redman]
We go 1 blunt, 2 blunts, 3 blunts, 4
I’ve been high since british walkers and quarter roys
And bruce leeroy
Before I got my first check
Now that last tragin, you can smell it on my breath
Got sativa, indeca, chromes all in the raw
Mortal when I puff, puff, past and I finish her
Ratty doing cheeks, beast from the east
Slight club on the beast, ash burns on the seats, we off
I’ma pass this bomb like mcdad, keep the whacks from high times
And I’ma take a gag
I take your wifey out for dinner
Hit her in the bathroom for getter, then I leave her with the tale
It ain’t a …of bud I ain’t smoked yet
And if I run out of buds nigga, road trip
You know your boy funked out, get you high… throw your hands in the sky, let’s go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: DoItAll]
God off said nigga roll a weed up
Off my clothes, I brush the ass like dandruff
I bump the scalp I escape through the handcuffs
Long walk, long gone, bring brag benson
Kim dog kush strong long, that’s a great puff
3 boys bad off ciroc like a great props
Raise your hands, get in line, just to face us
Quick chip, all ride, on that short bus
Been a long time fuck about the moments here
Yeah I’ve become a fool since the wiseman shakespeare
What you smoking on, what you got there
Van Gogh flow, yeah it’s the left ear
Do it all boy, go and put it to the sky
Fuck you redman, I’m so high
420 o high, blowing on the sour
Little rocker bye bye inhaling on the lala

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mr. Cheeks]
I can’t front, I smoke trees all day
If I ain’t got none, stay out of my way
I get cranky, rude, I got snucked in the safe
Score me in it and everything’s ok
How you show it to the spot then don’t come with
Blow trees and backwoods, nigga that’s some dumb shit
Now you know that I’m about that man
Smoke eats smoke, that’s the pot half plan
I make music so I used it while I’m writing
Smoking while I’m doing it, it makes it more exciting
Stay rollin, stay lights in
But never stay …shit that’s frightening
Any problem the solution’s in the bag
Nigga you’s too tight, you need to take your …
Cause I’m the real, need to rising…
