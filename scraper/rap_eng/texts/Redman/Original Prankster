You can do it!

[Verse 1: Offspring]
Until the break of dawn - life, life
Cannot go by the letter - time, time
Prozac can make it better - noise, noise
Any kind will do;
Can you feel it slip away when it's all on you (hey, hey)
Crime, crime - rockin' like Janet Reno - time time
Eighteen and life in Chino - Freud, Freud
All along it's true;
Well you'll see there comes a day catches up to you, yeah!

[Chorus: Offspring and Redman]
Knock down the walls - it's alive in you!
Knock down the place - you're alone, it's true!
Knock down the walls - it's alive in you!
You gotta keep your head up through it all
You're gonna bust out on it (Original Prankster)
Break out, yeah! (Original, yeah)
Bust out on it (Original Prankster)
You never stop now, stop now
That's what the main man say!

You can do it!

[Verse 2: Offspring]
You know it smells like shit - God damn!
Tag Team the Double Header
Son of Sam; fire always makes it better
Navigate with style and aplomb
Cause wherever you're at, that's the tip youse on (hey, hey)
Lies lies - says he's down in the Bahamas - tries tries
Bangin' little hoochie mamas - no way
None of this is true
Well you'll see there comes a day when the joke's on you yeah!

[Chorus]

(hey) You can do it

[Bridge]
Dime, dime - so good to see ya
Nine, nine - don't wanna be ya[x2]
Crime, crime - fine sensimilla[x3]
Well you'll see there comes a day catches up to you, yeah!

[Outro]
Knock down the walls - it's alive in you!
Knock down the place - you're alone, it's true!
Knock down the walls - it's alive in you!
You gotta keep your head up through it all
You're gonna bust out on it (Original Prankster)
Break out, yeah! (Original, yeah)
Bust out on it (Original Prankster)
You never stop now, stop now
Stop now stop now that's what the main man say!
