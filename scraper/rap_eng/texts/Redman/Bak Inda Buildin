Yo, Redman is the COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLEST shit I done fuckin' heard!
(Yeah, hahaha... this is Dr. Trevis, comin' to y'all motherfuckers live)

[Redman]
Yo, I'm spittin' my rhymes, we gonna get you
To bump the music to break your neck to
(Yo yo yo yo, ay ay ay) Yeah
(Y'all muh'fuckas ain't ready)

Yo, when I spit my rhymes, we gonna get you
To bump the music to break your neck to
You want the hard shit, nigga, let me connect you
It's 1-800-YO-GILLA begin_of_the_skype_highlighting 1-800-YO-GILLA FREE  end_of_the_skype_highlighting, feel me flow
I open doors for the newcomers
I show you how to rock the mic
Pull yo' pants up and do somethin'
I lay my hats where my boots stompin'
Whether Jersey or Australia with kangaroo jumpin'
Yeah, I feel that hip-hop's gone
My pen catch attitudes, it cry in a song
I laugh cause I'm a vet
And still get the guap as strong
As any nigga, I ain't alarmed
Yes y'all, it's the Doc, I'm back on my business
With jizz for, real niggas and my bitches
I got my hands on my steerin' wheel and stick shift
Drivin' by nigga, pissin' on yo' picnic

One time for your motherfuckin' mind
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
Gilla House, is bak inda buildin
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
Gilla House, is bak inda buildin

Yo, yo I'm back on my grizzly, set the bear trap
We don't work for Nike but sure can air a mac
My pen game tight in the hood like hair wraps
You a 40 Year Old Virgin, gettin' hair waxed
Now, Reggie Noble '07 internation-al
My girl got guns in her speghetti-strap gown
If you love hip-hop, where my people at now?
Relax now, got it mapped down, Gilla House
I jump in the crowd (Ohhhhhhhhhh!)
Whenever I do it I do it loud
Grown man style
Since I was a child butt-naked
I knew I would grow to be the one {?} on record

One time for your motherfuckin' mind
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
Gilla House, is bak inda buildin
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
Gilla House, is bak inda buildin
