Gilla house

[Verse]:
I used to ride with a homie in an 88 Flyntwood
40 O.E., BDP in the Kenwood
If fam don't kill ya, bet that your friend wood
Fuck all you critics, I ain't ask for you input
Redman, 'bout my green, knockout king
My truck taller than Yao Ming with pop out screens baby
Fire cracker hot, M-80
The truth is all about the proof like Slim Shady
Them hood rat ladies like "He ain't shit."
Cause they hair ain't even longer than DJ Quik
I know they mad at, the LeBron of hot 16s
Stress a bitch out till she go bald like Britney
Your pockets got the alphabet, M.T./empty
Go get my money or leave with an injury
I play no games, my state on flames, hot
You like Monique in J.Lo frame, not
I stack my gwap patiently
My nigga move, I Jack Blacks like Tenacious D
Jack whites, jack Japanese, we don't care
We'll leave y'all with nothin' like Debo here
This style's rare, you ain't gon' find in the street
I'm from the east coast nigga and my timin' is sweet
Yeah, Redman and I'm up in this bitch
Hector and Insanity customize kicks
Yeah
