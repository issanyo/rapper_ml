[Production by Reggie Noble]

[Verse 1: Redman]
Motherfucking
Ladies and gentleman, my style's rugged like Timberland
When I clock dividends women give me more love than Wimbledon, ah
My style flow local like New Jersey transit
And I can't stand it, and you'll need Teddy to unjam it when I cram it
I'm from, N to the E, W-A-R-K
Newark NJ got the AK, when I wave bitch you better say "Heey!"
I'm a Kid From the Hall
I got big balls to make your pussy walls dribble in my drawers
Hey boy this is the way the East coast swing it so bring it
Man I turn your ass Brown-er than James with the Sex Machine shit
I keep the chronic patrol on the road, in case you're wondering
Why I keep my ism, cause I smoked everybody else's shit up
My style's the ultimate funk when I mic checka, one two checka
And I give effects to niggas with my Black and Decker, so check
The manuscript, man you flipped, put it down if you can't handle it
Got a B.R.C.G., Blunt Rollers College Graduate
I got a degrees in Physics on how high I can get
Then next I check how many niggas that can die from my Tec
Cause the N-E-W-A-R-K is where the niggas robbing
And stealin and fucking niggas everyday
Now Jersey's on max so pass the dutchie on the left hand side
Hide the hidash, in case we cridash, in my ride
So, sliiiide, before I call the medics
You can bet bitch you couldn't get fly if you was FedEx
Can I, drop the funk on ya, run it on ya
Strong as ammonia, smell it from here to California
Cause Reggie Noble dropped that cock named Noble at Sunoco
I'm better than rice and beans when I rock you ocho to ocho
My music more underground than a kid at 300 XL
Convertible, fuel-injected, that's why my style's well-respected
I'm dope on the ridealz, so fidealz, on my didealz
And chumps are wondering what two niggas dropped the funk, funk!

[Hook]
Who is dem niggas
Who is dem niggas
Who is dem niggas Redman and Reggie Noble

Reggie Noble drop the funk one time

[Verse 2: Redman]
Verbally you never heard of me I smoke you third degrees
And cause surgery for emergency, cause Reggie Noble style like burglary
I get hot busted when I dip my nuggets
Hey, if it take a million niggas to stop it just like Chuck did
Cause we run around Newark with the nine on cock
Keep it heated for the brothers that's not off my block
And if ya don't know the flavor, be a tough guy and enter
So go show you more nigga events than Jacob Javits center
I'm genuine, to the rhyme, get your canines
Cops that got the hot Glock stocked for when it's playtime
I rock around the Robin tweet tweet on the calendar
Cause you couldn't pull my number if your class major was Algebra
I make bitches moan to my Stallone without Sylvester
Cause I'm more deadlier than a whole school system of asbestos
So check us, I always smoke mad blunts before breakfast
Cause I, Get Around like 2Pac with Poetic in my Justice
Hold tight, hold tight, everybody hold tight
I'm sooper like my man cat, cause I keep my styles jam packed
I (wreawow) like Anthrax, split my pants like Bill Bixby
You could tell the tracks was fat from the work of my MP-60
I smoke the chronic that's why my sinus always fucked up
Them bones, them bones them bones, will have you fucked up
I blaze blunts with my nigga Mellow, yo say hello
(Yo what up dog?)
Really, now pass the second blunt to Quilly

[Uncle Quilly]
Now sit your big ass down cuz I don't know about this rap stuff
There wasn't rap when I was pickin cotton, saying massa
Y'all y'all whippersnappers, with the caps on backwards
Man, y'all fuck around with Quilly I kick a bone out yo' ass quick
Watch out now, I ain't bullshittin
I representin the oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-G's from forty-three goddamnit
And if you keep on with that dirty mistreating
I'm gonna whoop your ass, 'till your heart stop beating goddamnit

[Verse 3: Redman]
And yo, chronic bubonic the funky bionic you find it I'll have to rewind it
Where minds are blinded, "Time 4 Sum Aksion", so time to find it
I'm smoked out like a cookout, look out my dick's out
That was last album when I was bouncing on trains like Malcolm
I was hiiiiigh, I thought I wouldn't survive
That's why I quit my nine to five and got live
Because this "hip to the hop" shit fills my pockets
And I'm Audi for '94 because I already got my props
Hoes, hoes, and more hoes...
