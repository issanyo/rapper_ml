[Dr. Trevis]
How you doing, Redman, I'm Dr. Trevis
Okay, my papers show that you strangled a white male by the name of a Mr. Van-Allen
At a rap concert, matter o' fact, Redman
My papers show that you committed the same criminal acts in 12 other states
Okay, what we're gonna do here today, Redman
If you wanna bring some of that unnecessary anger out your system
But I can't do it alone so what I need you to do is co-operate, okay?
Nod your head up and down for yes, and side to side for no
Right, okay, erm.. Redman, I hear that you're a rapper
If you had your chance to create your own album
In your own words, tell me
In your own words, how would you build it
How would you make it work?
Focus your mind, focus your mind...
