Intro:
All this way, I'm doing my thang (x2)

Verse 1:
Guess who? The realist flavors like mystic
Coming through with drama, question my karma
E-Double mack supreme, um I got cha, I'm in my land crusier pumpin' Junior
M.A.F.I.A
I'm freshly dipped and I'm ready for the night, I'm doin' the boom bang
Boogie band for my niggas
No gold diggers, it might resort to triggers
But a few tricks that's down for the cause, breakin' all laws, and takin'
Off they drawers
Cristle flowin', Moet flowin', Don P flowin', y'all not knowin'
Huh, it's on like that and everybody's welcome
So react, bitch no diggity, Ain't No Future In my Frontin', just ask MC
Breed
Yo Jazzy bring the leaves

Hook:
I got freaks in the living room gettin' it on and they ain't leavin' till
Six in the morining
Yeah, cause I'm the man above and if you're going down, um I got 'em (x2)

Verse 2:
Lookin' at my Roley it's about that time, a quarter past 9
I'm lookin' through my blind, cars start rollin' up
It's my niggas and my cousin Jah-Boogie with the goodies
And behind his ass some girls in a Wrangler
Gettin' out doin' it, I'm watchin' them persuein' it
Huh, they all come in, I give my niggas a pound
Just chill while I start the sound, now the vibe is on like butter on
Popcorn (say what?)
So we gonna do it all night long, 3 hours past by, I'm off the hook
There's girls everywhere, I swear, I swear
Smoke in the atmosphere, indo on the window
Check out this light ?, on this here single, ha ha ha
I freaks the funk for my people, y'all know the sequal, technique is mad
Lethal

Hook (x2)

Verse 3:
Uh, It's all good I suppose, I'm still feakin' hoes
I'm still freakin' flows, I'm Boombastic, Shaggy
My pants stay bagggy, Karl Kani down, so how's that sound?
Hey, I'm the best thing since AC, I'm gettin' money and the sex is free
Realize recognize I be the green eyed bendit in flesh, and y'all know the
Rest

Hook (x4)
