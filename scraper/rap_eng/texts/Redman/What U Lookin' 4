[Intro]
1996
Knocking on these punk-ass kiz-ods
Bringing it down the hill in the Jersey section
In the dark
Oh, in the dark

[Redman]
It goes one for the mind and two for the money
Who dat wit skull tattooes and his nose runny
It's me, that funky MC, the Rrr-ah E
Indubitably, I'm Jersey down to my Timb tree
Officer, you're hawkin the, ninety-three Landcruise-
When it's real criminals, you should be watchin' for
Get off my dick for what you don't got
Plus you probably never licked a shot from your Glock
Walkin to my car witcha nine out the holster
Put your hands on the steering wheel like ya s'posed ta
I cooperate, don't give the redneck no hassle
Because too many mistakes be happening to black folk

[Hook]
What the fuck are you looking for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
Hah hah, leave ya butt naked...
(In the dark)
I said what the fuck are you looking for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
(In the dark)

[Redman]
Ayo stash that weed up while me and the cop is riffin'
Damn I knew I shoulda got that stash box built-in
But it's alright 'cause me and my niggas roll tight
We all think alike, we jump out whoever packin pipe
Don't they know who's the freak from the East?
I get faded like Chong and Cheech without bleach
And started spittin' game 'fore these cops start to reach
On these creeps, showin' mentality from the streets
Even though we had a half a pound by the seats
My peeps never tweek, we handle shit when there's heat
Since one cop was white the otha was a brotha
I pulled out my tape and front page of the cover
Of The Source, told him me and Janet's on tour
Broke it down to who's my boss and who I rap for
Plus them niggas, EPMD
Put me D, now I'm runnin with the Green Eyed B-
A-N-D-I-T, and Def Squad camp
Here's your Def Jam tickets and your autograph
Now haul ass, I got a meetin' 'bout seven
Basically I'm saying bye bye like Guy

[Hook]
Ayo what the fuck are you looking for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
Hah hah, leave ya butt naked...
(In the dark)
I said what the fuck are you looking for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?

[Redman]
My license, been suspended, for about five years
The system got my ass in the jam
Can't even ride to see my fam in Alabam'
I get petrified everytime I see the man throw the lights on (woop woop)
The mic's on so I stress it
Shit, I'm haulin ass before I start undressin'
Niggas on they knees with they hands on the top of the-
Heads while the Feds crack jokes with the Glock in ya
Don't get me wrong I know a lot of cool cops
That'd let me go if I had two Glocks and oowops
But, I don't, so, I keeps it, real
The five hundred series with deep dish peels
Quick, my bitch, stash, two clips, between two her tits
Before the cops fuck with the Rrr-ah
I'm a nigga of today a nigga of tomorrow, beyotch!

[Hook]
I said, what the fuck are you looking for?
