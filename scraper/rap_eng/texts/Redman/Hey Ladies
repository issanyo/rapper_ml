[Redman] Yo yo..

{Chorus 2X: Redman and Lady Luck}
[R] HEY LADIEEEES!!
[L] Luck's the name
[L] Stay a-bove the game, for ones bust them thangs
[R] HEY LADIEEEES!!
[L] Yo, you niggas can't stop me
[L] This chick is cocky with the big body papi bought me

[Lady Luck]
Nigga I be, that chick that'll brawl with a dude
Strut around nose up with a attitude
Flaunt jewels, haunt crews, Luck is bad news
Pull 'em out a tool, show ya what a MAC'll do
Aim for your North Face coat
Or put three up in your small face and a couple up in your throat
Far from a joke, AND it's that time of the month
My niggas came to the party drunk, gettin it crunk
They say it's, type foul how I look at life now
Slumped in the drop with a loaded ri-fle
Type wild, lifestyle, dizzy off Cris-tal
Talk with a lisp now, walk with a limp now
MUST be a pit now, I'm always with my man
Grand in my hand just signed to Def Jam
Along with Nia Long lookin for "The Best Man"
Lay up in the wet sands when not in the 'luxe Land
Nigga uhh

[Redman] Yo yo..

{Chorus}

[Lady Luck]
You heard the flow's lava
And little momma spit it hotter than the enchilada
Foot to the floor, whip the Jag like a stunt driver {*SCREEE!*}
The Glock right beside her
And Shannon Scholar follow and we came to lock the block up
You heard "blaka blaka" coward get your coke and rocks up
Somebody call the cops up, need vice squad to stop up
Doin a buck-thirty zone in a big poppa
How I look; fallin in love and then Luck get knocked up?
I need a brolic nigga (uhh) hydraulic nigga (uhh)
Swervin from the feds, ridin coke pilin nigga
I'm never silent nigga, Luck get kinda violent nigga
The type to snatch you out your car and take your wallet nigga
(Get outta there!) I roll with cuz-ons, fam get your thug on
(Why not?) Type to beat a nigga down if he mug wrong
Every time, Luck mix coke in every line
And stop askin nigga yeah I write my own rhymes

[Redman] Yo yo..

{Chorus}

[Lady Luck]
Nigga I be, that chick that have you eatin through an IV
{*beep, beep, FLATLINE*} You cowards try me I'll let the slugs fly free
Where the rocks be?  Where the jocks be?
You grab a Glock and let it pop if you gon' stop me
I'm probably hot, the Goddess in here
Better spit your hardest this year, I'm starvin this year
Regardless who here, Luck gon' murder the flow
You broke-ass niggas act like you allergic to dough
Never get none nigga let your lip run
And watch my clique come, cock back and spit one (blaow!)
Move smoother than the juices when my clit cum (uhh)
And every time I rock, watch my pockets thick-en
Y'all ride dick on any cat that can buy the P-rada
And scatter my motto why bother when Luck about dollars
Female rap Tony Montana bubble like saunas
Bring the armor make your block look like a tiny Pearl Harbor
You wants no drama

[Redman] Yo yo..

{Chorus}

{Chorus} - 1/2X
