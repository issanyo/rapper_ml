You ready?... yes sir.. let?s do!
Redman
Hey Yo, baby I?m back like Carter, The Don Dada
Stuff sour diesel in the God Father, go hard or go home
Streets on the phone like red takin it to the max like top shotta
Proper how da man keep a plan how to pop up, that?s why I spit like a Louisiana
Chopper. Mr. chief rocker, do it all I done it, any mc around ain't clear.. I run it
Yeah I got my chest out, blunts got my mind right, 16 bars about the size of a
Klondike. Mr show stopper, when I am done a bar fight, now I get treated like
Kids around mike, get it rock the NY fitted New Jersey do it quick as a NY minute
Got the smith like emit. I run it back, skip town, hot 16?s is the only way I?m
Doing a sentence. Sky?s the limit think I?m bigger than wall st, Chris Wallace said
It, my pen got its heart beat. What up to Marcy, Brooklyn I?m sorry I ain?t kicked it
So I signed up for Karate. Hip hop monopoly pass go 3 times, ordered TiVo for
Assholes to rewind, ( Gilla House we grind) aye boy get em off us never sleep no
Caffeine to make a star ? buck

Inhale ? exhale I?m proof that sex sells
Now watch my bank account boost like a Nextel
From Marseille Paris to Cali, you can find me where ever the Bally
Probably with Halle bury the Audi, interior whiter than Bill O?Riley
I?m Akbar Preme mixed with Muhammad Ali, plus I got Big L spirit inside me
Your money like Bob Green, my money like Yao Ming, everybody gets scrilla on my
My team, we shine like high beams, the dream like Akeem that?s why I?m the prince
Like Naseem, nah mean. Ready da man aak, its big Willie stay fly like Hancock, catch
Me in Jam Rock with niggas with dread locks that never waste bullets all they do is
Take head shots, shots shots. Fire shots man down, these damn clowns shoulda knew
Ready was the man now. I hooked up with Gilla & figured the plan, how to be #1 in
Hip hop hands down, plan down. Clamp down like pliers this man on fire, soughta
Like Denzel or Marlo from the wire, the rap rowdy piper, Makhi Phifer, the D.Csniper
I?m gonna need me a diaper up in my new Viper

CHORUS
