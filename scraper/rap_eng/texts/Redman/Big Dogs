'Pon cock, the Don Juan Doc
Send crews back to the shoeshine box, connect the dots
My description, black male, yellowed and mellow
I make it hard for MC's to run neck and elbow
With D-O, penal code, Deebo knows
To duck when he hear the bike, wit the squeaky clutch
Swallow this hard act to follow
You could parachute off my slang and use my, rhymes to toggle
I'm tense, so smooth I can't be fingerprinted
I stomp harder in slow motion.. den, den-den-den
Yo, fuck your applaud, bitches still rush me
Like they rushed the store before Soul Train Awards
Incorporate a law, whoever ain't raw get they hand chopped
By Jamal with the Wu sword (whoooo-eeeee!)
My crew specialize in, snakin your bitch
Robbin you, while you on the floor, shakin and shit
I'm doin me now do you (Yo, who you?) Doc
I bomb shit til the Conflict's Crucial, I
Be the black "El Nino," I mean yo, I'm supreme
Like the team show witcha paid yo' cream fo'
(To see us sit down?) Yo, nah we get the fuck up
(And leave the one you wit) Then take her from Usher
That's right, six-double-oh with chrome pipes
U.S. Marshal's, out to pen us up like Snipes
(Throw it in drive) Fuck takin me and Meth alive!
(Aiyyo you lick that a-way) You lick out the other side!

[E-Dub] Ohh, yeah yeah
