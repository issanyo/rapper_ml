[Intro]
Clap ya hands (hahahahaha)
Clap ya hands everybody, cause I (Uh)
Clap ya hands (Uh, paging Reggie Noble)
Clap ya hands everybody, cause I (hehehehe)
Clap ya hands
Man I'm hungry muh-fucka
Clap ya hands everybody, cause I (Ow!)
Clap ya hands
Skills, nigga
Clap ya hands everybody

[Verse 1]
I'm so amazing, flow is cajun
Fly, everything aviation
Feel like Clark, and I'm on vacation
I throw it in the park, now I'm back to basics
Who need teaching, I'm cocky, I'm reachin'
It's ugly, like when old lady's ain't decent
I don't like beefin', my weight like a vegan
But compared to y'all on the mic, you ain't eatin'
I ain't talking Lambo's & F1's
More like Rakim & KRS Ones (hahahehe!)
I'm killin' em, you can keep your money
Our boss need a big desk just to write the check on
I know I'm difficult, rap got typical, but I got visual (Yes)
The bam like Bigelow (Yeeeeees)
I'm like the i12 app for risers
[?] so rush represent from New Jersey's finest

[Chorus]
Clap ya hands, everybody, cause I brought weed for everbody
They ask "Redman, what's the sound?" I tell 'em "Muh-fuckin' (The year is 1990, 90!) 1990 Now!" (There it is)
I said, slap ya hands, everybody, cause I brought weed for everbody (Let's go!)
They ask "Redman, what's the sound?" I tell 'em " Muh-fuckin' 1990 Now!"

[Verse 2]
Yo, I want the Green like 'Cee Lo', be the new niño
Have Italian chicks grab my libido
You got the swag, but I got skills
I'm half Huxtable, way I'm after them feels
Yes sir, nigga, I'm a hustler too
When I hit the rap game, where the fuck was you (where was you nigga!)
'92; I was G Rap cool on camera
Was all in the zone like Deion Sanders
New niggas hate that, old niggas make that
That's like a Maybach, built with an 8-Track
Scrubs, they get Ajax ASAP
Niggas who wouldn't squeeze a mayonnaise pack
70's; I was Commodore's & Whispers
Rival gangs like Cowboys in Pittsburgh
When I was putting up Muddy Waters Stickers
You was a young cat, trying to meet Big Bird

[Chorus]
Clap ya hands, everybody, cause I brought weed for everbody
They ask "Redman, what's the sound?" I tell 'em "Muh-fuckin' (The year is 1990, 90!) 1990 Now!" (There it is)
I said, slap ya hands, everybody, cause I brought weed for everbody (Let's go!)
They ask "Redman, what's the sound?" I tell 'em " Muh-fuckin' (The year is 1990, 90!) 1990 Now!" (Let's Go!)

[Interlude]
I want the Green like 'Cee Lo', be the niño (Woah Woah Woah)
Have It-The fuck is you talkin' about?
(You said that shit already)
Ah, I did, right? God dammit! Bring it back

[Verse 3]
Yo, when my camp on fire; Smokey the Bear
So only fadin' is mostly the hair
Got women clumsy, like Sinclair
And so many Jordans my nigga owe me a pair (I swear)
I can afford to take losses
With all these exhausts on the horses (Doc!)
You won't find me up in the office
When it's Friday and I want Ms. Parker
Yeah, I'm kung pow around a sundial
I should be rich now like the Rothschilds
Rather, I'm in the hood with a black'n mild
Listenin' to y'all demos on Soundclouds

[Interlude 2]
And-
Y-See!? (Aw!)
Y'all done fucked my vibe up, man (No!)
Fix y'all shit, man

[Chorus]
Clap ya hands, everybody, cause I brought weed for everbody
They ask "Redman, what's the sound?" I tell 'em "Muh-fuckin' (The year is! 1990, 90) 1990 Now!" (There it is)
Clap ya hands, everybody, (Aw Man) cause I brought weed for everbody
They ask "Redman, what's the sound?" I tell 'em " Muh-fuckin' (The year is! 1990, 90) 1990 Now!" (Let's go!) (Yessir)
I said slap ya hands, everybody, cause I brought weed for everybody (Brick City, what's good baby?)
They ask "Redman, what's the sound?" I tell 'em "Muh-fuckin' (The year is 1990, 90!) 1990 Now!" (There it is) (Whoooo)
I said slap ya hands, everybody, (Latifah what's good baby?) cause I brought weed for everbody
They ask "Redman, what's the sound?" (Gilla House) I tell 'em

Music slows down & soon cuts off:
Turn yo mother fuckin' mu-u-u-u-u-u-u-s-i-i-i-i-i-i-c...

[Outro]
Yo, What the fuck!
AW!
Who the fuck turned off the power!?
(Fuck man)
Fuckin' Assholes
