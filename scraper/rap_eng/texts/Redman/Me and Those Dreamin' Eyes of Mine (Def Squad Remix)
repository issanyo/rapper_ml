[Rap: Redman]
I be the Funk Doctor Spock, originator of wreck shop
The type brotha to give your stolen car a test drive
So hold your brown sugar, because the way I pound hookers
Keep ‘em coming back like I’m a *sniff* cooker
Time for Sum Ak’, but I don’t push a Ac’
I push a Lex coupe and love to push your wig back
And it’s like that, like DJ Run and Darryl Mac
(He’s the D) I be the … blasted on wax

[Verse 1]
When I first saw you baby
I wanted to die
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine
Started to cry then I'd dream
Wishin' my fantasy
Would soon become a reality
‘Cause every time I see you baby
All I do is sigh
‘Cause you're the most precious thing baby
That my dreamin' eyes has ever seen
So I continue to dream
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine

[Pre-Chorus: D'Angelo]
Ohhhh
Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw
Or is my imagination running too far
Or is it that my eyes are telling me something you could never see
Something like me being with you
And you being with me

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
Ooh wee baby you've redefined my vision of love it seems
You're love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams
So it seems my oh my
Me and those dreamin’ eyes of mine

[Verse 2]
Oh my goodness here she comes
Switching that ass
I wonder if the men in her past
Had treated her bad
But if I had the chance
I'd treat her like a queen
Just like I do in all my dreams
If you only knew how many times
That I think of you
I'm quite sure that you would find yeah
I'm sure that you would find
I'm going out my mind
My oh my, me and those dreamin’ eyes of mine

[Pre-Chorus: D'Angelo]
Ohhhh
Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw
Or is my imagination running too far
Or is it that my eyes are telling me something you could never see
Something like me being with you
And you being with me

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
Ooh wee baby you've redefined my vision of love it seems
You're love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams
So it seems my oh my
Me and those dreamin’ eyes of mine

[Rap: Redman]
Yo, me and my man D’Ang go into tree spots with a grand
And leave out with 200 just to get our brains rammed
The freaky spitter with the chinky eyes
The Green Eyed Bandit programmed for me to blow the track
Wide open, who’s next to float by Billy Ocean
I got a city of girls wet and still soaking
Yo, dreamy eyes, you better run it
I blow spots the cops would have nothing to do with like 800

[Pre-Chorus: D'Angelo]
(Is it that she’s just the finest little thing)
Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw
Or is my imagination running too far
Or is it that my eyes are telling me something you could never see
Something like me being with you
And you being with me

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
Ooh wee baby you've redefined my vision of love it seems
You're love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams
So it seems my oh my
Me and those dreamin’ eyes of mine
