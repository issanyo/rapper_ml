[Keith Murray]
I'm talking to you niggas on the north, south, east and west
Fuck with Mally G and get a hole in your chest
I'm dropping enthusiastic metaphoric-type lines
The baddest nigga to ever come out of from the crib and rhyme
Rappers fall prey to my deep meditation
As I break their ass up like abbreviation
I stepped to the microphone and shouted
Girls, who's got it
Can kiss my ass and make a love song about it

[50 Grand]
I'm off the wall from every phrase that's said
I black the fuck out, hunting rapper, like the Pumpkinhead
I come from the deep side, with Def squad in the basement
My style's been on deathwatch, like suicide patients
Cause 50 Grand sparks the illest level
With the sickest craft
I contact more skills then the devil
Soon as Rock makes the ingredients
Blend baking rappers in the oven like little Ginger Bread Men

[Jamal]
Def squad representin'
Get's no rougher then this
Lyricist
Killa scene with the guillotine
Showing them execution rap style from juvenile
Across the border with alphabetical disorder
In slaughter
Increasing pain
Insane, deranged
Motherfucker, blowing their brain on different terrains
I take a fake ass nigga and toast his ass
And leave him numb, like multiple sclerosis
Blam

[Kel-Vicious]
I'll be that funky, psycho, lyrical maniac
I run around crazy
Their huffing and their puffin' could never faze me
Cause I'll be, Kel-Vicious
I get lifted pay per view
Read my guide though
Hot damn, the funk is homicidal
Now, who died
Looking at me
I ain't nobody
I'm just that little nigga who'll be fucking up the party
I will snuff the DJ, my lifestyle is grim
And niggas get blasted in the mix like phlegm
Check it

[Hook: repeat 8X]
Genetic for terror

[Kel-Vicious]
Don't ever cross
My style is rougher then up north
And I'll never take a loss
Kel stay on course
I've been living off the raw dog shit
Type of more-and-more shit
A lot of MCs lost it
I'm here to terrorize the hardcore in the underground
Niggas back down or you'll get smacked down
On the real
This nigga's a motherfuckin' trooper
I sleep with the Luga
And blast at intruders

[50 Grand]
I walked the streets manic-depressed
You can't fuck with my steps
I swing stab wounds to your chest
To put your ass in deep check
So who's trying to see, Legion Of Doom, Def Squad
Leave niggas restin' in peace, like a motherfuckin' graveyard
I'll split your cranium
Take your bullshit agenda
Twist you head off, like Dr. Mindbender
Who's the suspect, dressed in black
Legion Of Doom
Down for whatever
Bringin' the Genetic For Terror

[Keith Murray]
Before I even fix my lips to speak, you know what I'm gonna say
Something freaky
With much word play
I walk the face of this Earth
Playin' punk pussy motherfuckas out for what it's worth
Buckwild like juveniles done blew trial
Lockin up with rappers, Roman-Greeco wrestlin' style
Plus, there's no such thing as Murray gettin touched
Girls jumpin my flow, like double dutch

[Jamal]
I leave 'em lost, in between resurrection
And Judgment Day is where that punk nigga lay
And it's deeper then you think
And furthermore and whole lot niggas gon' stink
Fucking with this, funkabis, nigga from the mist
Motherfuckas motionless stiff from paralysis
The Def Squad emcees, PPP
Full of structural abnormalities
And we attack invariably
Diss your permanent disabilities
I Icecapade like Peggy Fleming over funk beats
And lock down the streets
