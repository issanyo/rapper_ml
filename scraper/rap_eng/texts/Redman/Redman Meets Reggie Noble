It's a slaughter if you order the hit without the water
And if swallowed without the damn water to follow
You might be doin' a stupid dance and win a grand at the Apollo
I'm rough, snap necks, drink Olde E, but crack Beck's
Wreck anything that's wet, when I have sex
For instance, I mix with, a style that make you shit bricks
Tsk tsk, I'm musically gifted, terrific
Boom-shaka-lak, Red got crazy knots
And knots in the pots, got props from here to George Washington Bridge
I get biz, I use hats, so no kids

>CHUCK D, FROM PUBLIC ENEMY?
Yeah, he's a friend of me
>THE ONE THAT SAY "BROTHER AND SISTERS?!"
Yeah, but he's no kin to me
I'm strictly negro, I freak the style and there it goes (BOOM!)
If a stitch in time saves nine, then I got shit sewed
>>>PUT PINS IN NEEDLES, AND NEEDLES IN PINS
>>>A HAPPY MAN IS A HAPPY MAN, THAT, WHEN I'M HITTIN' SKINS
Fuck skins, I'm hittin' puss' when it's douched
Then eat it when the puss' is well cooked
LOOK!
