[Chorus: Cal Scruby]
Do or die, it's just you and I, it's my human side
Who am I, you don't fuck with me then who are you inside
Ooh that line probably blew your mind murder suicide
They say Cal the hottest Cal the coldest I'm the two combined

[Verse 1: Cal Scruby]
Studio in We-Ho so expensive so I be broke
Life it go up down up down left right just like a cheat code
That's why I'm taking shots toward wherever like it's b roll
You should stay the fuck out of my lane like I'm shooting free throws
I go get my team all them bitches, go Rick Pitino
I'm the one that's coming out of your speakers, guess I'm the keynote
I could spill the blood and the rug and blame it on the pinot
Go to Reno, I blow cigarettes smoke inside the casino
Yeah, roll the dice, hit eleven twice, I see stranger things
Poltergeist, cause it's overpriced, tuck away my chains
When I talk to God, I pray for people, I don't pray for things
With my gang swinging off the tree like orangutan

[Chorus: Cal Scruby]
Do or die, it's just you and I, it's my human side
Who am I, you don't fuck with me then who are you inside
Ooh that line probably blew your mind murder suicide
They say Cal the hottest Cal the coldest I'm the two combined

[Verse 2: Redman]
Redman middle finger celibate, so who the fuck are you
Keep playing, you’ll be Martin and Eddie sent to the upper room. Hot and cold, lyrics are north pole, I make it snow in June
Started fires in Cali, now it’s arson in the vocal booth
I am a leader, sorta like LeBron when he crashed the boards
I got the bud, greener than the slime, at the choice awards
He ain't ready, He ain't ready, that’s what they hoping for
Punchlines that I be saying leave me with a broken jaw. BANG!
Women break the law to try to apprehend him. BANG!
You ballin nigga? I'ma cut your Achilles Tender
Yo Cal Scrub, I got the juice, no Tropicana
They wanna play rough? OKAY! I’m Tony Montana!
When a black kid gets shot, it’s hardly going viral
Can’t understand this ghetto shit then read the subtitles
I ain't a killer but I murder the mic, judge
I did it no witness so my verdict is life. YES!

[Chorus: Cal Scruby]
Do or die, it's just you and I, it's my human side
Who am I, you don't fuck with me then who are you inside
Ooh that line probably blew your mind murder suicide
They say Cal the hottest Cal the coldest I'm the two combined
