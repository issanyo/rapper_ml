[Verse:1]
Money on my mind, Doc on the grind
I ain't on Billboard tryin' to climb
Killa on set, don't press rewind
I'm like the thirty-something year old Lebron
Boy I'm fucked up, way past tipsy
Smoke on my lung, Tequila on my kidney
Grown man but I land on the water
So move back before you get caught in the rotor
I'm like a G4 to your General Motors
Ya'll take orders, Red in like Otis
Ya'll game novice, Doc's a pro
I'm a boss like I married Diana Ross

[Hook]
Roll through the hood like, Fuck Da Security!
Walk in the club like, Fuck Da Security!
Smoke on my blunt like, Fuck Da Security!
If you not the hood type, You Need Security!

Now when I do a show
I rely on my gros to pick me up off the flo'
(Fuck Da Security)
Because I'm too high and drunk from jumpin' up in the crowd
Security like "fuck you yo!"
(Fuck Da Security)

[Verse 2]
That's how I roll, fuck da security
They're everywhere, look can't even urinate
I'm the last nigga that get intimidated
Don't get it? Then let me reiterate
Boy I'm hustla, throw one of them knuckles up
Walk in the restaurant, hand on your jugular
Ride in that BM better buckle up
Back game crumbling, bricks gon' double up
I tee off hoes, look how my putter up
Old folks say I cut her off lil sum sum
Only one champion and you're the runner up
Coo coo for cocoa puffs, watch when I perch him up
D O C, guzzlin' Hennessy
Fuck the club nigga and fuck securityyy

Now when I do a show
I rely on my gros to pick me up off the flo'
(Fuck Da Security)
Because I'm too high and drunk from jumpin' up in the crowd
Security like "fuck you yo!"
(Fuck Da Security)

[Hook]
