[Intro: Violator]
From the east coast ballers to the west coast riders
DJ U-Neek and Violator presents
The ghetto's top dogs. Ha ha ha...

[Chorus: Shatasha]
We're standing strong
So come on (so come on)
Get your flow on (get your flow on)

[The Notorious B.I.G]
I went from construction Timbs to Ac's with rims
Flippin' mixtapes
To bitches feedin' me grapes
Peep my mind state
Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range (Uh huh)
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Lock on you when you step in the car
That's the superstar status apparatus
More wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hashes in the pocket with the 9
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline (Nigga)
I want a presidential Roley (So?)
So I crush MC's to guacamole makin' Robin scream "Holy Moley!" Big Poppa, fuck the cape I'm that Paper Crusader
Playin' Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Coolio]
I shot dice with a preacher and drank yak with a pastor
So I see myself and I know, my own Lord and master
When your ass was born it was all on the own
And When it's time to die you'll be all alone
So open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone
And start takin' care of your own, nigga
Everybody's schemin' with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be be tryin' to fight me
Standin' at the crossroad but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts way
But low and behold, what do I see?
In the distance, some resistance

[Doodlebug]
When I traveled the land like my man in Kung Fu
Moshin' up this hip hop scene with my Digable crew
Now you and I know the science so don't front
Cause Brooklyn won't front, naw, we don't front
In fact, it's gettin' like a daily operation
Cee Knowledge born represents my young nation
And I'm facin' opposition in every form
So my man choose Squad 7, our's is on the swarm
Like crazily cause it don't pay to be
A black man in the land of mental slavery
They say cash rules everything around me, true
So what I gotta do to be as lavish as you?
I don't roll with no crews that do the same ol' same's
So I travel the seventh plain by the way of coal train
And that's an ill though, niggas get caught in my wisdom
Because the number seven's like the master of a rhythm

[Big Mike]
It ain't surprisin' these motherfuckers still hatin'
They must don't know, I ain't that nigga to be played with
Different stages, way back in '88
Bet a nigga like Mike'll stomp the head of a snake
My voice was felt, when my feet hit the ground
And fate is fair when my heat made a sound
Now, how did I relate what's gonna fall
When my niggas made the fuckin' final call?
We started out smilin' now they got us definition whilin'
Ninety Ninety Five, how many heads are gonna fly
With that rootin' tootin' southside shootin'
Bootin' any nigga who ain't troopin' with Huey Newton
Fuck his people and when it's time for a change
Nigga what you gonna do when we rearrange the game?
Blow him out the frame with new ideas
We's about the game, lyrics, puttin' it down out here

[Chorus]

[Buckshot]
I stepped in the jam with the guard on my side
And the guard S.T. is still waitin' in the ride
So I step to the DJ and tell the DJ
"Yo' throw the wax on" How many MC's must get dissed?
The mist from the blunts smoke decides who's next on me list
Can you feel the hiss from the snake movin' my direction?
No U-Turn, you're gettin' burned from the sun In my intersection
(Uh) the guard has spoken Sword stroken
If you think you ready for a fair one, pay your token
On my soul train, control your brain
Buck Town representative break it down like a key of cocaine
Drink from the lab
And I still elevate past the snakes and the crabs
Fuck it (Can you kick it?)

[Redman]
Huh, it's that Funkdelic, Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the vest, niggas better start puttin' on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk comin' in stacks, bullets hummin' from gats
So I duck, lyrical buck buck, get stuck
I'm jammin' like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That caused the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
Bladow! Blast my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punches and spit the flame
Like Lui Kang Burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leavin' your mic boney like that Tales of The Crypt bitch
All ya'll niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, now I'm bustin' your ass counter clockwise
I get dumb, but dumber, why your vision blurred?
For all the Losers

[Menace Clan]
Ayo, mayday mayday! Raise the white flag, let the pants sag
Fuck a drag (imma puff the whole bag)
Yeah, it's the low down and I'm the Low-key, The O.G
Niggas know me (True) So take it easy like Moby
The ex-convict on some Vietnam shit, criminal
On the subliminal (Niggas) watch what your women do
All the bitches wanna know why the frames I (ride)
That's just the Glock, that glare from the (glide)
Bear witness (To my mental fitness, no fear)
Precaution (may be) to severe (for your ear)
Yeah, Creep around, grow on the down low
Let of a round slow (Subtle) And leave you in the puddle
(So uh, breaker breaker one nine)
Course It ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like "Yeah, yeah, yeah (C'mon) Yeah, yeah, yeah (C'mon)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" It's like that

[Rock of Helter Skelter]
Hey yo, I can rhyme as long as my dick get pumped
I grabs the mic and do what the fuck I want
I'll outlast any blunt, White Owl philly, your a dutch master
Roll like a natural disaster
As I crack ya, ass like cheap plaster
I might bash ya, while my tongue lash ya
With the rhyme rules I crash ya, leave ya like a car wreck
Then I give you the tribute to the Rippa Tech
And I slash ya, after, I'm sure that you're ghost
I go see my bro with the fro and we toast
So all the punks in the partner planet, plus every single fool
Cause without all of 'yall, Helter Skelter wouldn't rule like we do

[Layzie Bone]
Puttin' your shit to tha pave, endin' up meetin' the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazed
But they never did phase Bone
My deadly thugsta brothers ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, ya dearly departed, better off then

[Wish Bone]
Been labeled a pyschopath, fall down with a buck and a blast, when given my chance
You niggas is fearin' my sawed-off, put me to rest, so fast to blast
So if you thinkin' of kickin' it, you best be packin' your shit you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cause I'm mowing you down with the quickness

[Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, buckin' em once again
And niggas they pick up the pen and they try to contend
But see all they be win is that Mack 10
There's never another to go with a brother, I'll smother a sucker
And go undercover, we leave 'em in gutters, they claim to get down
But then who was the sucka that squealed on the murder?

[Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street sweeper
When I reap I pray the bullet'll put in much work
Put in much dirt, wet shirt, puttin' the bullet just where it hurts and umm..
Wit' a me Tech I stepped up, runnin wit' a buck
Po-Po's won't let a me duck, Lil' B your set up, wet up
Get 'em when I get 'em, Bone don't let up

[Chorus]

[Jamal]
Ayo, Jamal gets down, the master of bringing the massacre
Rollin' on Crews like Pharellies on Acura's
If you don't believe my steez is real
You can check the emptiness of my Glock nine mil
It don't matter which way you come
I still be the nigga callin' shots with the gun
I lick one shot I make your whole squad run
None, Is about to fuck with the sun Mally G
I never kick a rhyme for free
Function rap skills, I come live like T.V
For all of y'all, I come across to be real
With super shit like Fall Guy And lines to make them all die
Infrared beams, mind full of schemes
'95 until keep it real get the cream (Yeah)

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You better believe everytime we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around my people start subtractin'
They cause this shit then they wonder why we start overreactin'
Hey-ey-ey! You can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'mma hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me go inside, please give me room, yo step aside, ha!
Those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there droppin' dimes
Get yo' shit drawers up out my hamper
The survivalist represent the next black panther

[5th Ward]
Where you from, fool? (Studio Wood, Fifth Ward)
Bustin' caps on that ass, real niggas stay hard
Sex and ass like the man Uncle Sam
The hardest motherfucker recorded on Past Scam
And when I die, please bury me a G
The fascia was, and bright flowers ain't necessary
I fantasize dead bodies in a creek
Wake up in the morning screamin' "Murder" in my sleep
I'm goin' crazy, Lord have mercy
A hellraisin' thug, somebody save me

[Chorus: Shatasha x2]
