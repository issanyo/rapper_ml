[Redman]
What you know about it? (4X)
A-what you know about it?

Yo.. get it right from jump
Doc tape been on debate for months
I got zits on your face that can't wait to bump
Boogie Down to the point I barricade the Bronx
Papi spins the rhymes through your opti-lens, check it
It's five below, my brain is cold
Runny nose evey time Doc exchange a blow
My street team snipe the block up like Rob Lowe
Bodega liquor store, I'm dead in the window
PPP symbol got FBI on lookout
Strip the dirty clothes, hit a 118 cookout
I woof out, son you better buckle in
I write the madness, got ink foamin at the pen
I tear a ligament when I spit it in the wind
I got so much game I can Con Edison
Yeah chicken stand by for exposure
Shut your house down foreclosure ya in cold blood
(Yo cuz) Shut the power out in your house
Cut the phone put a sock in your mouth, let da monkey out

Yo let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out, hear me out

Say, oooh ooh ahh ahh ahh, yo yo (2X)

Yo let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out, hear me out

Say, oooh ooh ahh ahh ahh, yo yo (2X)
Y'all motherfuckers ain't ready

Is Redman in the house? (One time)
Form a line, jack ya, then pawn the shine
Stay there, runnin with more kids than daycare
One shot prove it ain't nuttin but weight here
When he lands flat I'm the minivan
With Lil' Cease, runnin cities like Geechie Dan
When Richie Cunningham was Opie I was low-key
Airing niggas that was more square than my gold teeth
My appetite for destruction is to hustle
All the cottonmouth'll turnbuckle when I rustle
Mr. Tough Guy on the side, I fuck him up too
Slam him, when I bark I marked his Buchanan

Yo, New York niggas in the house?
Yo yo yo.. is Jersey niggas in the house?
Yo yo, I hold fort with a quart of Olde E from Newark
I tell lies under oath if it please the court
Supreme force, in the swamps with the green moss
Bug repellant suit, bustin machines off
I'm Danny Roman with the forty-four blazin in
No negotiator, yo not even Chris Sabian
Can save your life -- Doc'll creep in the house
Yo cut the phones, put a sock in your mouth
Let da monkey out

Yo let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out, hear me out

Say, oooh ooh ahh ahh ahh, yo yo (2X)

Yo let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out, hear me out

Say, oooh ooh ahh ahh ahh, yo yo (2X)

Yo let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out..

Say, oooh ooh ahh ahh ahh, yo yo (2X)

Yo let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out.. yo

Say, oooh ooh ahh ahh ahh, yo yo (2X)
