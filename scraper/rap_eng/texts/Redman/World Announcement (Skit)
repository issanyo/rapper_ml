Can you count, suckas?
I said, can you count, suckas?

We have appointed delegates from each organization.  We got the West Coast Riders right next to the Midwest Playas, right next to the New Jersey Jackers right next to the New York Ballers.  Nobody's wasting nobody, and that is a miracle. And miracles are the way things ought to be.  Now, all we got to do is join forces. It's only like nine labels, and it's like 25,000 MCs.   50,000 trying to get organized, 25,000 unorganized, but ready to fight.   And we can take over this industry. Can you dig it?  Can you dig it?

CAN YOU DIG IT?
