[Verse 1]
Every time I roll the dosha, the flow get colder
And that's when the hoes come over, freak 'em like Nola
Bend 'em backwards and choke her, then I get an encore like Hova
Yeah, they can't stand me, family, but they in Miami
And a rapper ain't taking me out, duck like Manny
Fuck hurricane Sandy, I blow shit up
Even the bathroom on Friday like Stanley
Doc's da name, so what's happening?
The hurricane may a short for the gasoline
But no thing, I boomerang hoes
Still call me Marcus, I bang, bang, bang on Jacqueline
Nat King Cole, unforgettable
Even my mama don't call me Reginald
Fuck y'all up like y'all brownie edible
Set if off like Kane the way I let it roll
Breathe sativa
Animals on attack, I'm the zookeeper
Opposite of deeper
My bullets hit the whole body
My nina just signed the prenup
No half when I rip the vocab
Hoes I just met now a dope addict
Future Willy Wonka, the super
Run down on you with a oompa loompa
I'm real, don't take me serious
Little bit Eddie delirious
Niggas copy, but they sloppy
Need to read the blueprint of the nelly vanilly kit, KITT
The Knight Rider, this ain't for minors
You can't deny 'em, far from a liar
Peace to Kuniva, sour supplier
Hand me the fire, Sandy survivor
That's right, my bars' Klondike
Amsterdam, those my alumni
Hit 280 onto the turnpike
Looked around Jersey, it ain't no lights
Peace to Queens and Rockaway
Jersey, I love the way we operate
Us not having fun, hustling
That's like marrying Eve, not today
I'm sitting in hurricane Sandy
Bumping the new album by Brandy
Check on my moms and granny
Everybody's alright, family
God is good
Look at the light-skin 2013 Robin Hood
When the lights come on, we can probably up
I hit mommy up with the Cali bud, let's go
