Redman, I'm back like "fuck you pay me!"
A Street Fighter like Baraka, you may Lee
Who does it better than the bricks called?
You couldn't mark the spot if you shopped at target
Believe me, boy, I'm just getting this started
And y'all stupid like tripping over a cordless
I've been the dope nigga since swimming and bowlig
Your hot chicks on your block
I'm digging in all them
Damn it feel good to see people up on it
To see who's the raw
And what nigga stepped on it
I'm in your harlem night Black tenant six
The cops Calhoune and I'm hauling ass QUICK
When I'm gone,I redline the needle
Cause trying to find me is like trying to find Nemo, bitch
