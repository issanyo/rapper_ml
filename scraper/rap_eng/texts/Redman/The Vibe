"Check the rhyme y'all" "vibe" (x14)

Rockwilder:
As I purchase a twenty bag of the sticky
Keeps me buddhafied till I'm level with the Budda-flies
Take a crusie through the land of wicked
I wear my hair saddisctic, my waves unpredicted
BMX lyrics pop wheelies and grandstands
Hit those and quarter pipes and do one hand can cans
For the bitch ass that act the bitch ass
Some niggas let that shit pass but Rock is quick to kick ass
Quick fast, I keep the star by the focus lace the blunt pocus
With the dust the dead locus
Psychotic insain anxieties
Have noriety of animosity to insult my philosophies
You got to be the sickest out there that underrated noyokated
I hate it and wish niggas never played it
Xross Breed for 9-4 9-5 2 G's high 5 for the Queens live vibe

Hook:
Xross Breed is in the house keep it live y'all

Ease up ease up yeah I got an appetite
For milk bones alpo and niggas who ain't rappin' right
So before you pick up the microphone to flow
Play like Teddy Pentagrass I think you better Let It Go
Get on this higher plain with my higher brain
From the weed indeed my mentals coastin' down the firelane
I'm absolutely for the loot G, fuck a groupie trying to soup me
I'm from the Q.B., I've always been real, no bitches in the infield
It fucks the whole look up like birdshit on your windshield
So clear the way I'm freakin' rhymes in a major way
I roll with more niggas than Eastern Parkway on Labor Day
I don't want the drama ho
Even you mama know my style phenomenal
And I'ma flow more Ghetto Jams then Domino
It's Xross-Breed gettin' the best of ya comin' at cha
Like Patra, come test me now

Hook

Redman Outro:
To the beat y'all as we enter your eardrums
With the cosmic funk for 9-4 9-5
Pack Pistol Posse is in the motherfucker for the 94 era
Causin' much terror to the brain
Look out, ha, don't do that
