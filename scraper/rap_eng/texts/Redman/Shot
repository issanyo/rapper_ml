[Intro: Redman]
Only thing I need is a path to go to eat
A path to go to the bathroom to shit
And a path to the motherfucking seat to go work!
Work my nigga work!

[Doni]
Light up the piff while i count my vices
Life inside the brink and the sleepless nights
And I can see the lights when I close my eyes
And try to save my soul when i speak in mics
Can’t go back to the vortex of snow and ice
Snow flakes on my debit cards like winter nights
Winter ice will freeze the slience
Crack the mirrors like thunder fighting

[Collar John]
Running on the beach care free, the hassles off
Last on the scene EMT with the panic call
OB shuffle off the side , tide all red
Sea split crawl to the shore
When it’s all said and done
Y’all kid sonny
My shit money
My piss run green
Split the middle, real sharp cuddy
Gotta spend the time
Or it's life getting wasted
Generally not a fairy tale
This shit's not safe kid

[Elias]
Lemme pick you up
Let’s hop in the ride
Light the blunt and roll the window
Yelling WHAT UP 5
Twenty over, blazing switch side to side
Doing shit and acting reckless
Hoping I don’t die

[Doni]
Call shotgun
Lemme hold a dollar funds low
Smoke and mirrors
You can call me Dr. Oh No
Oh who, D-O-N-I with the torn shoes
Old news, 'dobe in their minds like some fake news
Bank account overdrawn from eating out at Whole Foods
Lose control and crash my whip
A couple dents and scratches and my pops is pissed
Refuse a 9-5 cause I ain’t no shhh

[Collar John]
Lace 'em up, 'em lace in, lace 'em out
When it all goes south, option Click Clack Blow
Get to see two-thou come back, power to last the drought
Twenty degrees out, dog to cloud
Yeah it’s a solid wall sound that y’alls is seeing
Coliseum
You can ride the wave, but call John to see 'em
It’s the gauntlet sting op
I’ll see yall when ups caught
Can the cam, pop the locks
Make sure the lights is shot

[Redman]
I love to fucking work, my nigga
If I could work everyday, my nigga, with no sleep
I would work my ass off
Because I love maximizing my capabilities!
I love maximizing my creativity!

[FanningSystems]
Throwing shade, what the scrutiny do
High tides, riding waves in your community pool
Make the community drool
Introverted intellectuals
Rock dilated spectacles on wide angle retinals
FRIED
No sunny side with same sign, like people
Find the North Star, both sides of brains might speak to
Might peep you
Might notice, ask you
Like equals, peace pipe and a piece a hash too
Choice narrative, shiesty as fuck
I like the sunrise cause sunset means the day is done
Missed its pray this tongue
Treat work like a hobby
Special toppings on my pizza
Plant based, relate shiitake
Health and stuff brings wealth and stuff
Happiness to rap with it
Consume or be consumed
Reduce, recycle remain active and
Having an, enigmatic sense
Of a dynamic ism
Sus thought
SHOT with the rapid wisdom
