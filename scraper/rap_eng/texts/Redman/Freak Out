Intro:Ha ha ha ha. This is Doctor Trevis, giving a phone call to y'all
Funky fuckers

Erick Sermon:
Y'alll guess what the fuck is going on now
Me and Reggie Noble, making funk tunes around the global
Cause times keeps on slippin', and I get the funk from the kitchen
Then commits to ass whippin', there is no time for me to bust it
So I'm a chill and let Red get into a fly poetic justice

Redman:
Yo, it's all in the mind and I'm high and I kick it for the do or die
On 2 or 1 area code, leavin' shit blown
Funkadelic is the one to bring the creature out your preacher
And I make girls act like they can't find they shoes when I freak 'em
Oooh, yes y'all I got the mad method can you catch it?
And if your ear's not tuned in then adjust it

Erick Sermon:
Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9 representin' today
Hey, Erick Sermon's on the way
Dre gave me a ride so I Gangsta Lean while DRS will put the smoke in my chest
And if you understand me then escape and kick it
While the E-Double gets wicked with your brain twisted
It's going down, it's going way down
Go get the 4 pound and boogie down

Redman:
Boogie boogie to boogie to bang, boogie to that
My rap get mad dap on ass cracks in effort if it's BMI or ASCAP
Cause my funk rolls thicker than Bisquick
If it's mixed with that same funky sticky stuff I roll my spliffs with
I shot the sheriff on the terrace
And I kick the funk like these to have more off days than Ferris
Just wrote these raps up in the studio
Brothers can't tell and sisters can't hear me though (hear me ho)

Hook:
E got the funk, Red got the funk, Red got the funk, E got the funk (x2)

Erick Sermon:
Someones knockin' at my door, yo Johnny Gill, I need the whole floor
So I can get busy remember? And if you don't call Michael Jackson
And don' be afraid to ask him, Erick Sermon got mad tunes
No matter what they say, I got more props than Richard Bay
The mind bogglin' with the hardcore followin'
So what's up, cause I don't give a fuck

Redman:
Whoa, I make you sing with Toni Braxton
I tear the shreds out of jams in stadiums when it's packed in
Back up boy you messing with the rudeboy yes I told ya
I rock leather jacks with Timbs, sweatpants; one leg rolled up
Hold up! This is a stick up, I spark the izm
The 'boom-kick' like a Biz cut, one twos and skirts'll lift up
E got the funk and Red got the funk, pop the trunk
I got blocks of funk to make a victim say "That's the one!"
Of course, I'm funky like fat people having intercourse
Basically the funk's stuck in your teeth so get your dental floss
Oh oh, freak out, 20 & over let me knock your teeth out
When I was young I made my tree house to a weed house
And I'm deeper than Nostradamus, swimming in chronic
And I leave your kitty cats meow in home made bondage (meow)
Beeotch, trick, trick, beeotch

Outro:
