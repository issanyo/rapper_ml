[Verse One: Fabolous]
You're lookin' at the rookie rapper
With a years biggest itcha rows
Yeah this nigga switch his flows
Yeah I dig and switch his hoes
Hear them niggas snitch to po's
Where a nigga pitch his blow
And how my hustle gross is near that nigga Richard Po's
I share my figures with the hoes
I'm where the digger stitch his clothes
It's ghetto F.A.B.O.L.O.U.S
I got street legend, fame
I'm the kid known to put the Colt to a bredren's frame
Like he's Edgerrin James
Y'all stash guns I carry 'em on my waist
Ya part time piece
Aquarium interface
The hood rat Hugh Heff, loungin' on ya in the Rolls
The project Playmates, around the corner centerfolds
I'm constant hated
Listen to the nonsense stated
But niggas can't shit on me like they constipated
I briefly conversated
These doors sittin' on ten times two
Mami what's so complicated?
Ya heard?

[Hot Karl]
Blao! Explosion, game on lock
Hotness, drop this, it's that sick hip hop
It's like blao!
[Fabolous]
I'm a coast to coast G, keep the toaster closely
So duck deez motherfucker
Blao!
[Redman]
Said it before, ready for war
With my sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump, pump
Blao!
[Hot Karl]
Collabo, asshole, you can't talk
Wanna make it gutter I can throw you off the sidewalk

[Verse Two: Hot Karl]
Why you talking shit kid?
You know nothing about me
I'm another bad creation like Michael Bivins found me
You doubt me?
C'mon, all your lyrics are absurd
And stupid like J-Lo spittin' the N-word
Cause as far as gettin' violent
I don't really go there
But test me lyrically and I'll get gangsta outta nowhere
Just point 'em out and I'm down to go get 'em
Cause most rappers says stupider lines than Ralph Wiggum
And continually flow the same style
It's all boring
While I kick shit that's sick like Alonzo Mourning
I'm still not sure why other rappers keep trying it
They're like Michael Jackson new album:
I'm not buying it
Keep denying it
I'm on some Jason Sehorn shit
Some pretty boy shit
So you surprised when you get bit
I don't really care if my records start selling
Matter of fact, I'm sick of rapping
Clue, start yelling

[Verse Three: Redman]
Yo Doc, pee on your floor
I'mma be on the whore
Till she knocked out, then I take a G out her drawer
I'm a thief, on the streets you might be in the morgue
Doin' a chicken of course, I take a key out a Porsche-ah
Box 'em in claustrophobic
I'm a pro y'all, know this
When sensing y'all controllers
Grown men is talkin'
This the fast lane, move over to the margin
It's over when I walk in
"Doctor" on my license plate
The front of my truck resembles Mike Tyson face
When I pull up to the club, the buildin' shake
Hoes start runnin' out
Niggas start runnin' mouth
I'mma bolt the door and security the area
Got! We molt floors to secure the Dillinger
Yo Doc! You want war, I'll be sure to bury ya
The more the merrier, but your
