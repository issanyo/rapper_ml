[Intro: Redman]
This is WKYA
Funky [?] is on the mike right now
We taking all callers that been to the West coast
That smoked that West coast bomb out there
Call us up: 1-800-MONEY11 that’s 1-800-MONEY11
We are WKYA

[Verse 1: Redman]
When you need that bomb, holla, bud lava
Shit to lift you up, Impala, roll that Obama
Redman stick like commas
Did I smoke the club out?
Yeah, your honor
Three strikes, my lawyer won’t budge
Me doing time? I’m a cannabis judge
What up quick? When we flash the cannon
I clear static like rapping near antennas
Bananas, ape shit, bomb
Triggered the White House alarm
From inside the bracelet
Wordplay, it’s like Thursday
‘Cause Friday you get paid and your pockets thirsty
Chicks barefooted, they love to do
They know I can’t wait on them for new shoes
Unless they in two, erotic nuns
Brainiacs raising they college funds

[Hook 1: Redman]
And the highs may come and go
But the weed gon’ stay around
As long as I keep a blunt (long as I keep a blunt)
Won’t be fiendin’ (be fiendin’)
WKAY nigga
And the bitches may come and go
But the weed gon’ stay around
As long as smoke that bomb (ay call us up!)
Won’t be fiendin’ (be fiendin’)

[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo, I’m Muhammad Ali with the mike
With a little Ike, Turner
Roll with Tina, my burner
International earner
Plug in anywhere I’m a
Worldwide converter
Massive to the masses
Take a class on longevity
I’ll play you the track list
Each song like a seminar
So you get your snap back
Like epsom vinegar
Trunk shit, to break your neck to
Redman to the rescue
My attitude, soul food, a little bipolar
Boy, I’m a test tube of Dr. Jekyll
That’s why niggas me’ll last
Strut through the hood
Where you need a pass
I’m doing 140 on the needle dash
And my car, hub, like the Martin cast, nigga

[Interlude: Redman]
(And as long as I keep a blunt, won’t be fiendin’)
We taking all callers that been to the west coast
That smoked that West coast bomb
(And as long as I keep a blunt, won’t be fiendin’)
Yeah, call us up
WKYA

[Hook 2: Redman]
And the bitches may come and go
But the weed gon’ stay around
As long as smoke that bomb (ay call us up!)
Won’t be fiendin’ (be fiendin’)
And the bitches may come and go
But the weed gon’ stay around
As long as smoke that bomb (ay call us up!)
Won’t be fiendin’ (be fiendin’)

[Outro: Redman]
It’s about 95 degrees right now on the West Coast, Pacific Time, you know how we do on that bomb. Shouts out to Compton, LA. Shouts out to all them niggas out there in Riverside, you know how we do. We going on that phone right now. If you’re riding with us on the Monday mornings too, then you tuned in to the right place nigga, yeah. Right now we smoking on that sour diesel, that OG.
