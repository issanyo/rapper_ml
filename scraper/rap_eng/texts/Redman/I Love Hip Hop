[Intro: Redman]
Yo, yo, yo, yo!
Yo. Yo, yo, yo, yo!
When I say Red, Y'all say Man
Red (Man) Red (Man)
When I say Red, Y'all say Man
Red (Man) Red (Man)

[Hook: Redman]
Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin' on a 40, smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun, Redman didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaaa
I said sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin' on a 40, smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun, Redman didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaaa

[Verse: Redman]
Peace to B-Real, I got the Marijuana plant on the G-grill
I hit bong like (Sniff), then I refill
Brush my shoulder, flex on 'em like Meek Mill
Yeah, Reggie home, I got a plan for 'em
The eyewitness news checkin' on the brainstorm
The champion, when I talk that jazz
Utah, tell Karl Malone I got a ring for 'im
I'm supreme, street smart marine
Hook off like Kareem tryina stop my ling cuisine
The hood ain't ready, my publishers said Reggie wrote it
My track record like Jesse Owens, fast
I'm going hard, no easy pass
I'm getting all this money with my greedy ass
Toe-tag 'em, zip up the body bags
My closet got kicks like Karate class
Let's Go!

[Hook: Redman]
Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin' on a 40, smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun, Redman didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaaa
I said sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin' on a 40, smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun, Redman didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaaa

[Outro: Redman]
