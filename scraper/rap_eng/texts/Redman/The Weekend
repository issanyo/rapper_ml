Intro:  Erick Sermon
Def Squad
Yo real
Let's make it happen
I hear voices sayin that's Erick Sermon

Verse 1:  Erick Sermon
I'm in the 500, sittin on twenties
Pumpin Junior M.A.F.I.A., and B.I.G. gettin money
I'm hollywood swingin
It feels good sometimes so I zoned out and freak the funk and start singin
No Diggity, if it ain't def it ain't shit
I'm like kerosene I keep the place lit
Yo will fix the beat up
No beef read put the heat up
Yo Dave you the man now speak up

Verse 2:  Dave Hollister
Friday, 5 o'clock time to close shop
Bounce through the hood, she was movin on the block
Cause my peeps already blowin up the box
With the 411 on the party hot spot
Hit the rest shake the 9 to 5 stress
Till about 10 and it's time to get dressed
Gonna be a whole lot of woo-haa!
Know how we do on and on
Till the early morn
Always wanna kick it not now I got move on
Beats pumpin gotta get my groove on
Everybody's on the floor gettin down
Playas on the wild tryin to spread the mack around
Red alert cause the bar's on fire
Servin drinks faster than you can blink an eye
Ain't gotta worry bout workin next day
The weekend's here and it's time to play

Chorus:  Dave Hollister
This is how we roll on the weekend
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, this is how we roll
(repeat 2x)
This is how we roll on the weekend

Verse 3:  Dave Hollister
Saturday, bounce back upon the set
Shorties rollin deep lookin right
Remindin me of the f I just swung her last night
Oh my god shinin, talkin' on the phone
Check out baby in the beamer on the cell phone
Gotta put my thing down
Lock down the next round knock down for the next round
There's a run for the full-court press
Up and down bringin on the opposition stress
But it's all love this is how we do
Til the next Saturday keep it all true
Next stop speed down to the mall
Gotta get prop for the night the next player's ball
Same time different place
Parlay on Sunday for the weekend

Chorus

I drop it right here
Reggie!

Verse 4:  Redman
My persona strictly don't be carin like I'm Donna
The Jerse bomber, go 10 rounds with anaconda
I blow the 9 x to order me some pussy
The Bernie Mack'll get the party bumpin' like burdussy
Yo, yo I'm fuckin your audio
Hardcore reservoir material video
And when you arguing me and my Dave Hollister  and E walkin
While the valet parkin shit

Chorus
