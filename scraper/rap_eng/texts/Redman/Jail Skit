Inmate 9184968, pack your stuff, you're free to go...
Dum da da dum duh, Dum da da dum duh
Excuse me, I'm trying to earn a mere buck or two
A solemn rapper come in, and who the fuck are you?
Around this part of town with diamonds and your girl's in fur
"I'm trying to enter in this rap contest you're havin sir"
You're kinda late "Flat tire" Well that'd do it cuz

Excuse me dear, my gosh, you look nice!
Put away your money "I'll buy that slice!"
She said, "Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just joking, but that's awfully nice of you"
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
It's DJ Run and I'm almost blinded her

Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door yo, guess who he saw?
Redman the dope fiend puffin smoke
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
I said "I need bullets, hurry up, run!"
