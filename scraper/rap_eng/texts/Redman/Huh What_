[Chorus]
Huh, what? (repeat 8X)

[Verse 1: Kaos]
Q-U-O entering the rap for the villian
Which be so funky I can smell it
So give me the mic, I'll come and rhyme
Oh, what's the time for some action
So keep yo place in the back son
Instead of the tune of the wicked rhyme
I got this slime, dripping out my nose while I find
A place of this fate and just swat in the ill position
So check the 94' edition
Teaming up with the funk the 5 freak of him
To stop my hand, I'm running up in to move ya fans
I ran with the ball like emit, drug dealing
And like jealous there ain't no selling
But not on the court, it's, it's cause of the mic that I slam
Cause I'm the man (uh) Yes, I'm the man (yeah)
East coast, west coast, ripping it up (that's right)
And all you can say is what (what?)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Syco Smoov]
Q-U-O entering the Syco resting it too
I'm bout to blow up just like a balloon
I'm going on the psycadelic smooth expedition
I'm fishing of my favorite rhymes that they missing
Drop mad skills up on the track, you know it's ayo fat
Espirated rhymes is uh fast, I make ya wanna bust out loud
And just owww, I blow out steam like at the loops
I got more more juice than 2Pac
I'm keeping my head up I won't let up, you got my back for the set up
Because the punks I made ya list, I go with my with my feelings
That's the proper tellings, you get squashed flat like the pancakes
Patty cake baker, dropping fat funk for ya fuckers
I got my soul the soul of factories, my name the KRS but I do white poetry
Respect in Sydney, Idon't front So get the hook, yeah

[Chorus]

[Break]
Owww, run to the beat y'all (To the beat)
To the mother funky beat y'all (To the beat)
Bet you know who's in the house y'all (Know who's in the house y'all)

Jersey's live in the house y'all (Jersey's live in the house y'all)
