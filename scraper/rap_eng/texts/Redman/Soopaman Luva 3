[Part I]

[Intro]
Look, up in the sky (SOOP-soop...)
It's a bird (SOOP-soop...)
IT'S A PLANE!! (SOOP-soop...)
Nah motherfuckers (SOOP-soop...)
Hahaha

[Verse 1]
I was, flyin through the motherfuckin sky
With my blunt full of lye, boom-ba-zee on fire
Code name beez the Soopa-Man cock my Luger
Blast your state trooper, I'm on the run G
I've got these hoes spreaded, from Japanese to diabetics
Toes stay painted because of my foot fetish
You damn right, they had to ban me from eatin pussy all night
W-W-F'n bitches
Slammin em in the rope like Shawn Mike
I can't be touched bitch, I disco in kryptonite
Shit I'm broke as hell
I had to buy all my girls fifty-fo'-eleven Reeboks at wholesale
Almost got caught boostin out of Modell's
Bitches on my coattails like they coat rails
Can't even go in a jam without a bitch grabbin my hand
And squeezin my ass sayin "Youse the man!"
That's who the fuck I be
I got a, college degree, on bomb-zee and wreckin MC's
Makin shit happen like Lil' Cease
I come from a land of fonto leaf, bark from trees
That stick in your hand, and lakes rollin sea-weed
Criminals be up to no good
So I tuck a heater
Bulletproof suit still in the fuckin cleaners, but anyways
I bumped into my neighbor Johnny Blaze
Told me there's a bitch up the block who got more cock than AK's
The bitch just moved in, in building 210
Right next door to the Fantastic Four, and the Penguin
Good lookin Johnny, five-oh's right behind me
Let me act like I know and get ghost
Tuck in my Nina-Ross, get my cape and shades
Now I'm off with the Soopaman Three antidote

("While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse")
Cause I am so cool
("When I raise my trigger finger all y'all niggas hit the deck")
Cause I am so cool
("Cause ain't no need for that, hustlers and hardcore")
Cause I am so cool
("Raw to the floor, raw like Resevoir Dogs")
Cause I am so cool...
