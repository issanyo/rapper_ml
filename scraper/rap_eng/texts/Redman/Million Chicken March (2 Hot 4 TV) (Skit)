This is Nasty Naj from W-Fuck All Y’all Radio
And for all y’all bitches who missed the Million Chickenhead March
We got it on tape and that shit is hot (TOO HOT FOR TV)
We had a lot of speakers out there that touched on a lot of important chickenhead issues

[Speaker 1]
This is Liquidasha, president of the Baby Mother Coalition
Can I get my Oom-flocka-locka-locka sistas (Oom-flocka-locka-locka)
Our movement stands for three basic principles:
First of all, baby mothers should stick together
Even when we got babies by the same nigga
I’m sayin’, WIC checks need to get increased to 40 cans of fuckin’ Enfamil a month
And fellow chickadees, our most important issue is:
Why should we turn in our baby father for child support when we applying for welfare and food stamps
Baby mothers, we must stick together in order to survive in a world of bougie hoes

[Speaker 2]
I’m Crawtaniqua, the co-chair of Reebok
Yesterday, today, and forever, the 54-11 Chapter
