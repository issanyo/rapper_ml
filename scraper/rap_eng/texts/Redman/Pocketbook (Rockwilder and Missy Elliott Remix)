Yo doctor (hoohoohoohoo), hop out the cadillac
I'm so focused, smoke help my cataracs
Mind on my money, no money on my mind
And I'm looking for Me'shell, and a honey on the grind
Love is packed, I got my honey on the line
So I close my phone, honey know me when I'm lyin'
Cos I be tryin' to get my drink on
Find two freaks tell 'em drink cos Keith home
Murray, block to block we playin' dirty
My ? handle good, I shut the game early (ya head me)
Take two women to the telly
Let the animal out, ring 'em like Barnham Baily (*elephant*)
You can't smell me then I'm guerilla
And I ain't goin' nowhere like Puff and Ben Stiller
It's killer, keep a (uh) on the waistline
Me'shell, drop it when I yell (baseline!)
