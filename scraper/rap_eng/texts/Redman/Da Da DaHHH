[Verse 1]
Yo, I got a back ache, stomach ache, diarrhea, vomiting
Cold feet, runny nose, head ache, insomnia
Cranky, moody, burpin' while I'm cursin'
Baby chair tied in a Suburban drinkin' bourbon
I'm only 3, and gotta chip Motorola
A hoochie babysitter with snitches on the stroller
Lyin', cryin', whinin', teethin'
Suckin' tities like I had years of breast feedin'
In the beginning I was sinning, kept my mama
Back and forth to the hospital for the constant kickin'
Kept a ass whippin', I'm get in the mall
Show off like I'm for dolo, so fuck all y'all
Then you get your ass whooped, wish your moms bad luck
Like I hope, you, get, hit, by a truck
Playin' catch a girl, fuck a girl, put 'em in a sandwich
Just a young boy doing grown man shit

[Hook]
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
Like kickin' your ass
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
Smokin' weed
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
All day check it out

[Verse 2]
I'm only 13 puttin' in work, rockin' Chinese shoes
With high top Converse but first
We was all gassed watchin' Game of Death with Bruce
Walkin' home from the movies (wattaha, wattaha, wattaha)
I thought about the sex often,I even kept a
Hard one for them white girls on Magic Garden
Light skin, chubby and shit, ran my mama's
Phone bill up for callin' "Biggs Biggs Biggs"
The old heads used to make them little niggas fight
The Lee patch was the shit if you stitch it right
And everybody knew the pattern to Pac-Man
Grams was 15 and that then was happenin'
Niggas used to get robbed at twin city
I was cuttin' on SL's glue with a penny
When EPMD dropped "It's My Thing"
I said "Damn, I gotta get up in this rap game"

[Hook]
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
Like touchin' your titties
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
Like Stealin' my mama's car

[Verse 3]
I used to tell my little sis' "I'm gonna make it bitch!"
So close to gettin' on that I could taste the shit
In a hot ass room cuttin' Smooth Operator
In my last year at West Side High I barely made it
Flipping eightballs, going to Montclair State
I passed one class and still owe they ass cake
For quick cash, Doc hit up 13th Ave
Sell white boys oregano, dash, then we laugh
That was the days now the times switched up
Son either walk them dogs snuffing or get snuffed
Them ho's got triflin' but much thicker
My weed got better so easily I fuck shit up
I test y'all with my Def Squad camp
And I don't stage show dive unless y'all amped
To all my fans, yo, "Arrivederchi to ya!"
And any ho that didn't blow Doc, "I never knew ya!"

[Hook]
Now I'm a grown man doing grown man shit
Now I'm a grown man doing grown man shit
Like still squeezin' your titties
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
With a big ass car
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
Rollin' better chronic
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
Yo yo shit is crazy out here
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
Like smackin' yo ass
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
Like shaving my beard
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
I got hair on my chest
Look at it
