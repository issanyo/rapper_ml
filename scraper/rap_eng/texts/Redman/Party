[Spoken Intro: Redman]
Yes sir! Faith is in the building, ladies and Gentlemen
Yeah, I just got off work and I'm about to get my party on
How about you?
Ayo Faith, let's go!

[Verse 1: Faith Evans]
I've been working hard every day
'Cause times is hard and I got bills to pay
I got so much responsibility
And I deserve to dance the night away

[Pre-Chorus: Faith Evans]
Let it go and let the music take you
'Cause we came in through all night until the day
Are you feeling what the beat does to you?
Just let it through you
Send a message to the DJ

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get your back up on the wall
'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get your back up on the wall

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
It's Friday night, let the party begin
Leave your stress out at the door
Throw your worries on the dance floor
DJ, won't you please play my favorite song?
Nothing can go wrong

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get your back up on the wall
'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get your back up on the wall

[Rap: Redman]
Hey, I be like, one time, two times
STOPâ€”yeah, I came to party
I'm a G male, tell your females
I just popped up in a hot Ferrari
Look at mami, she like my style
House the party how I get down
Hit the booty then I skip town
Flow ridiculous, don't get drowned
I'm a hot man now, too hard to handle
Back in the car, Faith in the Lambo
Jimmy Choo tattoo on the sandal
Racing to Vegas just a gamble
Yeah, we fam-o and we get it in
Stand in the mirror acting like skin
Boy, when I spend, I blow the check
'Cause I came to party like Doug E. Fresh

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get your back up on the wall
'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get your back up on the wall

[Outro: Faith Evans & Redman]
Get your back up off the wall
We ain't stoppin' here, baby
You came to party
Redman in the building
So move your body
Faith in the building
Light one up if you're feeling this joint right here
'Cause I know I am
Hey, let's go!
Yo Faith, you a beast!
