* first single

You ready?... yes sir.. let's do!

[Redman]
Hey Yo, baby I'm back like Carter, The Don Dada
Stuff sour diesel in the God Father, go hard or go home
Streets on the phone like red takin it to the max like top shotta
Proper how da man keep a plan how to pop up
That's why I spit like a Louisiana Chopper
Mr. chief rocker, do it all I done it
Any MC around ain't clear.. I run it
Yeah I got my chest out, blunts got my mind right
16 bars about the size of a Klondike
Mr show stopper, when I am done a bar fight
Now I get treated like kids around mike
Get it rock the NY fitted New Jersey do it quick as a NY minute
Got the smith like Emmitt
I run it back, skip town, hot 16's is the only way I'm doing a sentence
Sky's the limit think I'm bigger than wall st
Chris Wallace said it, my pen got its heart beat
What up to Marcy, Brooklyn I'm sorry
I ain't kicked it so I signed up for Karate
Hip hop monopoly pass go 3 times
Ordered TiVo for Assholes to rewind (Gilla House we grind)
Aye boy get em off us never sleep
No caffeine to make a star - buck

[Hook]
Coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out
Coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out
Lyrical bang bang on the track man down
Coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out
Coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out
Lyrical bang bang on the track man down

[READY ROC]
Inhale - exhale I'm proof that sex sells
Now watch my bank account boost like a Nextel
From Marseille Paris to Cali, you can find me where ever the Bally
Probably with Halle bury the Audi, interior whiter than Bill O'Riley
I'm Akbar Preme mixed with Muhammad Ali, plus I got Big L spirit inside me
Your money like Bob Green, my money like Yao Ming
Everybody gets scrilla on my team
We shine like high beams, the dream like Akeem
That's why I'm the prince like Naseem, nah mean
Ready da man aak, its big Willie stay fly like Hancock
Catch me in Jam Rock with niggas with dread locks
That never waste bullets all they do is take head shots
Shots shots, fire shots man down
These damn clowns shoulda knew Ready was the man now
I hooked up with Gilla & figured the plan
How to be #1 in Hip hop hands down, plan down
Clamp down like pliers this man on fire, soughta
Like Denzel or Marlo from the wire, the rap rowdy piper
Makhi Phifer, the D.Csniper
I'm gonna need me a diaper up in my new Viper

[Hook]
Coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out
Coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out
Lyrical bang bang on the track man down
Coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out
Coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out, coc bak - spit it out
Lyrical bang bang on the track man down
