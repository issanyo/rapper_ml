Killa House
Brick City
Style P
When Funk Doc start takin' the drag
It's like who in the hell let this ape in the lab
Breaking the glass bong
I'm swinging harder than Cassius swung
The only kid with a Velcro, fabric thump
Neva! dropin' the blunt
2 for fire rollin'
89 in the bricks is 15 and growin'
Gilla House fam, you know what it mean
It mean your cipher ain't fuckin' with the lord of the ring
Dig it! I pack your pipe with nothin' but bomb
It roll on, like the Power Stripe under your arm
Hold On, En Vogue
Massive endo, I'm breakin' your dress code
I ain't rockin' kinda-gos
I just came to get high with Styles
And lock my, block like D with wider vowels
I'm talking about A, E, I, O, U
My skills already have niggas pressed, fuck an interview

[HOOK]
"I get high - high - high - high" (Every day)
"I get high - high - high - high" (Every night)
"I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory" (All the time)
"HIGH on your memory..." (Every day)
"I get high - high - high - high" (Every night)
"I get high - high - high - high" (All the time)
"I get high - high - high - high" (*laughing*)
"High-ighhhhhhh..."

[Styles]
I'mma blow it if it's sticky kid (what up!)
I smoke mayonnaise jars full of green like Biggie did
My pens my cigar, my bars be serious
You can't fuck wit me dawg, point blank period
I get high and hallucinate
A pound cost 6 in New York
But its half in Miami, nigga move your weight
My dimes be 1 point O's, 20's be 2 point 2's
Bring a snack and some fruit punch too
And you know I [*inhaling smoke*] the purple stuff
I'm so high that I can piss on a cloud
And make a bird look up
Smokin' haze in the Hummer while the bird look up
Gettin' high wit the hammer so the bird shook up
I get high like Doc and Meth
And "Let the Monkeys Out"
So I can "Bring the Pain" while I pop ya chest
It's D-Block when the bastards repin' (D-Block)
All I need is a lighter and some haze with a master collection
What

[HOOK]

[Method Man]
Okay
Who y'all know smoke more herb than Tical
Hit up a weed spot
Then off to the D-Block to smoke it with Styles
I fight my way up out the detox
Who smoke a slip
But he don't need block, just buds and cumulus clouds
Pull up your Rebox
This kid has gone Madd, Rapper like D-Dot
I got trees, but I'm tryin' to smoke what little he got
If not these niggas then who (Son tell me who)
Burn a leaf and get it Hot in Herre, like Nelly do
I get high, like Mary J. is all that I need to gets by
Stay red eye, no need to get fly
I get a rush (RUSH) when I'm rollin' 'em up
The other day I saw signs in the theater
Kids was throwin' 'em up
I get high, high, high
Every day I get high
Yeah I get high, high, high
And every night I get high
Yeah I get high, high, high
Mr. Meth I get high
Yeah (Yeah) yeah I get high, high, high
With Styles P. I get High-ighhhhhhh

[HOOK]

[Styles]
I am the Ghost
Flow with me
