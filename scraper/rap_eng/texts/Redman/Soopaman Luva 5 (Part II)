Aiyyo yo fuck that!
Aiyyo I gotta find my motherfuckin mojo
Aiyyo Reggie Noble, aiyyo Reggie Noble c'mere nigga!
Aiyyo start it off while I tell you how it went down

Yo, yo
Put the drop down, get your smoke on
Get your feel on, are you feeling?
Get your girl on, get your squeeze on
Get your bus on, are you chilling?
Are you wheeling, are you feeling?
How you feeling?  And we gon' hooo-oooh-ooh
(Tell me what you doin)

C'mon, yo yo-yo yo, yo yo
I had to put the mash down, throw the cash around
Stay focused, on the case put the hash down
Jetted through the air about five miles per hour
My mojo gone I can't fly like I wanna
But this case is easy, find that motherfucker that
Couldn't wait to be me, put his face on TV
From the Tec blow, I asked my ex-hoes
Pass off some info for a pair of X.O.'s
"Write the check low, I don't do that
I told you that shit before when I boned your back!"
Now I'm back to square one, and everybody hatin
So I popped the flare gun, now they all escapin
Ran into Gator, from Jungle Fever
He's my people and my neighbor, I said I need a favor
He said "For ten dollars, and for ten Whoppers
From Burger King, I'll tell you the nigga who gotcha."
Gave him what he wanted plus the extra large fry
He said "Blue eyes, blonde hair, a white guy"
I said... "What the fuck going on?!
A white guy interrupting my fuck flowing on?"
So I copped some new ammo, reloaded my flare gun
Stalking like Rambo, mixed with Commando
Gator pushed the ten-speed bike, I'm on the handle
Crashed into somethin cause he high off my man blow
I jumped up and backtracked myself
Who's the last ho I fucked or throat I cut
I said "Wait a minute, yo, that bitch Jane on the prowl again
I bet she up to no good, actin foul again
Yeah, yeah, it ain't nuttin, I get her if I want her
Matter of fact I'm gonna cause she live around the corner."
I walked up scared with my hands on my flares and my armor
Cause she bring drama like Jeffrey Dahmer
But I heard fuckin all the way from the bottom
I'm like, "Damn she yelling!"  Kinda made me jealous
Knocked on the door enraged
Like a broke-ass rapper, at a label that ain't toured in days
"Do it clown, before I count to four now
Cause if I hit five them flares'll blow your door down!"
I heard the zipper zip up, and they was tryin to run
So I re-clipped the clip up, and blew it before one
"Freeze motherfuckers!", I jumped on Jane back
"I want the cheese motherfuckers! And my name back."
We tussling, fighting, biting skin and rustling
Slaps in the face, chokes with the belt buckle and
Her knees buckling, I thought to myself
"Where's that motherfuckin white guy she was fuckin?" then
Right out the blue {*CLANG!*} Owww! {*birds chirpin*}
Who dat?  Who dere?
