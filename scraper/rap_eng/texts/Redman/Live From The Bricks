[Verse 1: Redman]
What's this I hear, er'body tryin' to bring New York back
But I'm from Jers', and I advise 'abort that'
I'm at the airport check, welcome me the fly nigga that make you laugh like Arnold Horshack
I grip my 9, everybody gangsta
It just made my job more easy to thank ya
I'm not a thug, I'm a father
And I think the blood of a father ride twice as harder
Then you gonna grow up broke, doin' DVD's Talkin' shit what you used to be
Man, homie you a joke, the worst in the camp if you can't write the fire and take it to the bank
An conversation 'bout rap, I'm in it
I stay on niggas mind's like ball-cap fittings
About my business, call on the man, ya damn right I put the 'Def' back in the 'Jam'
I ain't gonna talk about what jay ain't doing, I K.I.M. the problem 'Keep it Movin'
I dart my eyes, cross my t's, any nigga that do it like me is false I.D
Brick City motherfucka, yeah motherfucka. My name in ya mouth like silverware motherfucka
I birthed a lot o' niggas in rap, look at them
When you see them you see and that's a fact, nigga

[Outro: DJ Scoob Doo]
It's DJ Scoob Doo
