[Cut scene]

(Redman)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Brick City, Def Jam up in here
Yo, yo, scream at me loud, Keith Murray
Yo, yo
Relax ya mind and let ya conscious be free
You now rollin with the sound of the PPP
DJ Twin in the house, yo, Rockwilder in the house
Yo, yo, yo, yo Ica Don in the house and D Don

(Redman)
Check the Dr. Bombay making house calls
Buck trynna outball, I'm an outlaw, brotha come up out yours
Slumped in the front, Cadillac grill
Rollin by passin out heart-attack pills

[In The Basement]

(Tigga)
Now check it out right here, at the saga begins
It's Redman, big Tigga and the DJ Twinz
Rocka-wilder, comin on through with the Ica Don and D Don, big Tig, drop the bomb
Freestyle in the booth everyday forsure
Keep it rough, rugged and raw and give it ya (more?)
Step out the way and let this thing continue, inhale, the (tron?)
Next be my man Ica Don

(Icarus)
Ica Don blow dro, control the city
And I only hit chicks if they toes is pretty
Pissed off, ain't get to flow with Biggie
No single, still doing shows for fifty
A dirty dog
Chicks try to clean me up, I make em clean the truck till they knees give up
Till they say Icarus "Can I please get up?"
They think it's Christmas, way I keep the trees lit up
Face it, I'm in the basement, do it right
Y'all know, I do it everyday and night
I'm a sick figure, messing with big Tigga
Yo, D Don, come on in

(D-Don)
Let's play ring-around-the-Rosie, a pocket full of (?)
Pulled out early if they choose to test me
The gift between (?), there's no if, I'm swift
I don't drift from my (?) or give suckas a lift
I'm deep-dish like apple pie, made from Anne Smith
My occupational skills will be sealed with a death kiss
I can't resist, if you insist to diss, once in pissed
No plea bargain, overruled, case dismissed

(Redman)
Do I gotta go ape, or go nutty?
I leave ya eye like a 9-9 Benz Buggy, puffy
Brick brothas get real ugly, trust me
Keep the 4 if you lil lucky, mug me
I ain't got nuthin, but 4 figures
And weed and hash chopped in coffee blenders
My shots like squeegee-men on ya windows
Usual suspect, I'm the crippled member
Get away when I sat down in the office
Heat in my lap keep me walking off with
Why y'all talkin, the Doc reinforce it
The mic, is hard to keep my paws off it
Yo girl is my bitch when it's over
No Cristal, I pulled up with King Cobra
Out in a nova, don't bother
My Nina Brown, bust, it'll shut down the Carter
