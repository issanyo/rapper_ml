Intro:
Yo, this blunt is for all the niggas that was in the holding pen with me in central booking
Welcome to the system

[Ha ha ha haaaa! Yeahhh! Motherfucker!
Coming to you live from Newark, New Jersey]

[Hey Redman would you roll that blunt and get me fucked up]
Fucked up [all night] all night
[Hey Redman would you roll that blunt and get me fucked up]
Fucked up [all night] all night

[Yeah! Coming to you live, straight out of Jersey, motherfuckers]

[Verse 1]
Rock on, rock on, yo here comes that Funkadelic
I come wetter than Purple Rain, I bust brains
The Funk Doctor Spot, got the Glock, now I'm smokin out your sess spot
I rock from here to Bed Stuy, I hit the spot like XY
Who is that nigga that's comin six billion feet
I roll my funk and fontum leaf even smoke a blizz with 18th Street
I come massively with sneaky styles like Dick Dastardly
Look at the leather coat and afro like my man Shaft would be
The new vroom, crisp like chicken and Chinese food
I'm just like The Whispers here to put you in the mood [Jumpin Jersey]
Yeah you heard me, got more family than a Partridge
Roll the red carpet for Red from here to corner market
You're tryin' me, I'm a menace of society, right
[Yo, yo, they killed your style] Yo, I ain't lettin shit ride
Dropping the verbs and nouns, antonyms and homonyms
Govna Mattic plus I'm diesel like Don and 'em

Chorus:
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on
[Somebody, help meeeeee!]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on [Slide and rock on]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on
[Been waitin' for so long]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on
[Somebody, help meeeeee!]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on [Slide and rock on]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on
[Been waitin' for so long]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

[Verse 2]
My mama used to tell me "turn that shit the fuck off"
So I had to play like Foxy and get off [get off]
My shit was thick, I bought a clip then clocked my own grip, had honeydips
'Cause moms made enough loot just to pay the bills with, beeyotch!
Selling bags from uptowwwwn
Me and Lester put our money together now we got the block locked down
31 to local A-Train's, Hoboken
I took the back way, New Jersey transit cops were open
I'm hopin, that they don't go inside my boots
'Cause we had everything, from jewelry to Todd 1 suits
And ClienTEL, I'm drinkin Ballentine Ale in hell
So Redman rock well before our record sell
Then my moms crib was jacked by the jealous
[And they didn't come back] Is what the basehead used to tell us
[Yo fellaz!] Our whole scheme sinkin like boats
'Cause Les mixed biz with pleasure when we shoulda stuck to lactose
But every good thing comes to a end
With no ends, on the block, sellin weed again
My moms tried to make me go to school, I just didn't listen
Got locked up, now I'm all in the system, listen

Chorus
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on
[Somebody, help meeeeee!]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on [Slide and rock on]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on
[Been waitin' for so long]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on
[Somebody, help meeeeee!]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on [Slide and rock on]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on
[Been waitin' for so long]
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

[Verse 3]
Whassup! I tickle your putty-cats with my loonie raps
On groovy tracks, I make new jacks catch convulsions like groupie acts
From my city I spread it on like Jiffy
It's a mystery, my spliff be live like 145th be
I mold like Clay, and roll Dice just like Andrew
I stay "Strapped" just like Bamboo, my Cruiser got mad handle
Whatever, the weather be, I got mental telepathy
So throw your bombest rapper and watch me intercept MC's
I keep my car underground just like the Lords
Even though I'm known like all the four wheels on the course
So let me pull up to your bumper like Grace Jones
'Cause my shit be WAY off the hook like payphones
AHH! *dial tone*
