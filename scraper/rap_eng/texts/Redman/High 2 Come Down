[Hook]
Yo, I just smoked me some purple
Now I'm waiting for my high to come down
This girl popped her some Bam-Bam
Now she waiting for her high to come down
Come down, come down
We just waiting for her high to come down
Come down, come down, come down

[Verse 1]
Got a zip-lock of that [?] in the backwood
Boy I'm up all night, I'm Dracula hustling my racks up
Red and Homie smoke more than Cheech & Chong homie, yeah nigga, that's us
When I'm out on the West Coast, my little niggas say "Yo, relax cuz"
Rolling up that green crack, that grandaddy, and XO
Got a dancer that love my baby so I'ma leave her with strip throat
I'm a asshole on the mic, I think I was born as a test tube
Y'all fucking with Red, well here's two alphabets, FU

[Hook]
I just smoked me some purple
Now I'm waiting for my high to come down
This girl popped her some Bam-Bam
Now she waiting for her high to come down
Come down, come down
We just waiting for her high to come down
Come down, come down, come down

[Verse 2]
Yo, I smoke weed and I sold albums
Fuck with me, you got more problems
Pound of sour gettin' rolled up on my bus, that's a real low rider
Smoked blunt with Waka Flocka, rolled a L with Jack [?]
Colorado gettin' dabbed and all that bud, I'ma need tupperware
Brick City where I'm born at, California got the OG
Bay Area [?]
And on the West everybody knows me
Smoked a blunt with my boy Kurupt
[Illadelph] where the loud, homie?
You know how the East Coast gettin' down
I ain't talkin' weed when the pound on me

[Hook]
I just smoked me some purple
Now I'm waiting for my high to come down
This girl popped her some Bam-Bam
Now she waiting for her high to come down
Come down, come down
We just waiting for her high to come down
Come down, come down, come down

[Outro]
She just rolled us some purple
Now she's waiting for her high to come down
She popper her
Now she's waiting for her high to come down
Come down, come down
She's waiting for her high to come down

[Skit]
