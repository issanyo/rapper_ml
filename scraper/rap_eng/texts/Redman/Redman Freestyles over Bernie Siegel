[VERSE 1]
Yo, I'm like showtime boxing after dark
And weed, I got bags like shopping carts
Who gon' stop the shark, nobody
I take a big fish and gut him to caviar
Hood down, I know how my pistol sound
My bullets 2Pac hot, gets around
Flew bout' two blocks and it hit ya crown
I'm the king, there's no fingerprints around
Gangsta, naw nigga, I'ma breaks 'em off
Shotgun same size as a bass guitar
My name's Jamal from how High
I rock New Jers to now, why
I got the crack
It's like Webster tryna fight with Shaq
When I restaurant this and I take him Outback
Something like US taking over Iraq
Same thing with more connects than 9x
Reggie! You know my name I wear cool kicks sounding like he's
Ready!
Yeah my name is Reggie!
Ready!
Reggie!

[VERSE 2]
One, two, one, two fuck you mic checker
Chain so heavy can't hold my neck up
Dope flow, no bow, push it like Pepa
Fiends get hooked, by 10 get an extra
Extra! Read all about it, my pen got callus
Throw on cologne, I don't shower
I connect like internet with no router
Shit, we feel we the best like Khaled
Opposite of average, dig it
I pimp my flow, so the whole west coast can exhibit (Xzibit)
Turn it, shift it, routine till I'm clear
Like, American Gangster bootleg
On board like Lupe, jump on
Your whole career might change in one song
That's right, boy you can buy it
For 5 more thou you can have the sheets to outline it
I'm sort of caniving, in a good way
Like telling you "Fuck you, have a good day!"
I walk this way, one pants leg rolled up
Nigga, I rep AJ
