(Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)

[Dr. Trevis]
Ok Redman, on the count of three I want you to
Completely forget how you did the first album
Erase data number four exhibit C-Y protanium
Now... what I want you to do is concentrate
Concentrate on how you will do the second album
Known element 2-nucleus to the ninth power
Exhibit four-L-W
Now... when I count to three
I want you to fall into a deep mind of emotion
But before you do Redman, I want you to
Focus your mind

[Redman]
*somebody whimpers*
Tired of burning, ahhhh!
*whispered* Kill that motherfucker
E, help me get out of here
*whispered voice cackles* Die nigga die!
I don't wanna die
*whispered voice* Die! Hehehehehe

[Dr. Trevis]
I want you to concentrate very hard on how you will do the second album
I want you to take the funk where it has never gone
I want you to take this LP to where no other LP has risen
You son of a bitch!!
