[Intro]
Yeah, Brick City
NBA 2K6
Yeah, we live with the hardwire mic in this bitch
Killerhouse niggas

[Verse 1]
Yo, this is Killerhouse, Redman and Doctor
Come to your home and fart in your hot tub
Get your blunts lit, smoke out the party
If the beef boil I bring more broccoli
Ultimate fighter, lethal weapon
Got a gun named Glover, I aim it like Gibson
Fuck the radio, that's not the blueprint
As long as the street DJ's yellin' new shit, new shit
I'm happy, similar to Mary
Analyze the Brick City count, suyatti
Get y'all niggas high, that's why I'm here
Get y'all fucked up, that's why I'm here
Court's not adjourned
Boy shut your mouth, don't speak out of turn
Spreadin' your germs
I'm like Jesus when I make my return
With two ink pens that's dipped in the sherm
I can't be denied
Redman rock this motherfucker, right?
Smokin' on weed
I rap so beautiful, don't you agree-gree-gree?
Nigga let me breathe

[Chorus]
Get y'all niggas high, that's why I'm here
Get y'all fucked up, that's why I'm here
Get y'all fucked up, that's why I'm here
I ain't here for any other reason but that
If you too scared to bounce then step to the back
Get y'all niggas high, that's why I'm here
Get y'all fucked up, that's why I'm here
I ain't here for any other reason but that

[Verse 2]
My soul train derail a lame on track
This is hip-hop, not R&B and rap
Now if y'all want high, y'all gon' get high
Straight up raw, no cut, I aim to please
I roll up on a big chick and say
Excuse me miss, how much you weigh?
Her attitude sucks so I had to blaze her
It's okay, she was ugly anyway
I display skills, flows
Wake up and do Marine Corps drills, hut one, hut two
3D visual, audio surround
Jump in the crowd without an audience around
Break my back, ICU
Give me more fiend on the track, I'm rappin' slow
Six million dollar bro
That driver roll blunt with his eyes closed, yo
Y'all niggas ain't as high as me, yo
Bitches doin' coke, it'll freeze your nose
Get y'all asses up
Real niggas understand like huh? what?

[Chorus]
Get y'all niggas high, that's why I'm here
Get y'all fucked up, that's why I'm here
Get y'all fucked up, that's why I'm here
I ain't here for any other reason but that
If you too scared to bounce then step to the back
Get y'all niggas high, that's why I'm here
Get y'all fucked up, that's why I'm here
I ain't here for any other reason but that

[Outro]
Jersey don, pins in my dirty palm
Marijuana puttin' pot holes in my lawn
I'm that nigga, gotta think quick
For punk ass niggas, stay off his dick
Yeah, this is straight check mic, one two
Hardwire mic, no stands in the booth
Brick City cold and it's bitter
Y'all ghetto might be big but ours is bigger
Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger
Yeah, Killerhouse
Rock on, rock on
