[Missy]
Uhh, 3000 baby, uh huh, ooh, raunchy, raunchy

[Redman]
Good riddance, to niggas and bitches bullshittin
I house MC's like baths and full kitchens, ready or not
Doc,hood lynchin, icey flows, I write with wool mittens
It's two not one, Missy dot dot com, come once in the blue like free hot lunch
So once its on, turn it up, chickens flockin in
Shoppin at birds are us, murderous, don't blame me, blame the music
I write with napalms in my hands, flame the fuses, like ca psss, off you go
I'm nice battin, I practice when the park is closed
I'm that man who squats out of jeeps and vans
Jump to roof to roof on the TV cam, I fuck a model
I go out with the cheapest tramps, pussy have me trippin
Like Kima, Keisha and Pam, I remain cool like, like open house on a school night
Animal House gettin' thrown out for food fights, PPP strictly don't give a fuck
An Brick City niggas strictly don't give a fuck

[Missy]
Let me intervene, come between, like dick through your jeans
Hang down to your knees, its mwa the don-wan, carry on, D.A.N to the danger
Y'all MC's in a whole lot of danger, change up all your rhymes you need beats
My beats you see completely unique, forgive thee
See its the shots of Henessey that's in me, Reggie Noble through after me

[Redman]
It takes two to tingle, and two to fuck
I done fucked in Range Rovers to Isuzu trucks, used to move weight
Now you makin moves to duck, built solid without bolts, screws and nuts
Pussy tight jiffy lube it up, Doc came up, hoes use to hang up
Now my arm close hang up, my crew is deeper than Karl Kani pockets
We don't buy bullets, we ask what size rockets, for thee occasion
One shot will have you ravin', like Symone when the four four is blown
Two minutes later I'll make it hotter, snap you from the vine
To my um blada a boom glada

[Missy and Redman]
So what you wanna do, what you wanna do

[Redman]
Yo I got the chicken, the brew taken next, an much room Def Squad in the house
Drop you drawers, tell your boyfriend ease up, and park his car

[Missy]
I'm from the south you better watch your mouth, It's the M.I
The S.I, if you try then you die, I don't take no mercy on you suckers so
Would you still be in love baby, if I cut your throat, cut the jokes
I ain't got no love for yo, no friends with those, who imitate me ya bold
My style I own, I'mma have to steal your flow, you know me Joe
I gotta say no more, BITCH!
Thats right nigga, It's Misdemeanor here, Redman, Timbaland uhh
Muthafucka! 3 triple zero, the Matrix baby, uhh, I'm out
