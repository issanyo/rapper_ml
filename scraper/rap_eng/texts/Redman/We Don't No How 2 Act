Bricks.. yo, yo

Yo, Doc and Killer Bees Swarm
Grabbin' my groin
Walk in the bar, people scream like I'm Norm (Wassssup!)
Walkin my dogs, that shit on your lawn
I'll fertlize a whole farm when it thunderstorms
I carry weight, 38's in the waist
Battling me is like thirty 8's in Kuwait
We need that heavy ammo for the mammal
On your channels
Running with broke shackles 'round their ankles
You're four but.. I'll fist fight a slut
That'll leave her mouth red like pistachio nuts
You lift the band-aid, you see RED in the cut
Any bitch in my whip, she came here to FUCK
Dog, it's no love when I enter the club
It's like, blade, blood out you're sprinklers
I broke loose, full battery pack, Absolute
So action can't be closed-captioned
HERE WE GO AGAIN!

[Hook]
We in the club
We don't know how to act, and uh
We in the hood
We don't know how to act, and uh
We all whites
We don't know how to act, and uh
We on the mic nigga!
We don't know how to act, and uh

Brick City! Brick City! Brick City! Brick City!
Brick, Brick City! Brick City! Brick City! Brick City!
Brick, Brick City!

It ain't where you from, it's about where you at
Put you're shit away, you could get stomped for that

Yo, you want that hardcore?
Then ask for DOC
Only class I passed
Was blunts and acid watch
Call me the powder inside the plastic box
C-4, the for-eign until I deport
It's war, two guns or call it quits
All my gun talk, will start with an argument
Here's a FUCK YOU to my BITCH nosey friends
Shootin' guards, same position Kobie in
My mascot broke out the padlocks just in order
To clothes hang bicycle men and skateboarders
Cause you don't give a fuck, we just like ya
My middle fingers up, like thumbs on hitch hikers
When the bricks holla, if you want it?
COME GET IT!
Don't want your fam dead and tied?
DON'T SWEAT IT!
It's RED, I'm throwin lead off a moped
At high-noon, cowboy style
Walkin' with bow legs
I'll be throwing eggs mystery night
Before it is, I'll blow four in them
HERE WE GO AGAIN!

[Hook]
We in the club
We don't know how to act, nigga (and uh)
We in the hood
We don't know how to act, nigga (and uh)
We in the whip
And we don't know how to act, and uh
Ya'll startin' shit
Cause we don't know how to act, and uh

Brick City! Brick City!(Come On) Brick City!
Brick City! (Come On) Brick, Brick City! Brick City! (Come On)
Brick City! Brick, Brick City!

It ain't where you from, it's about where you at
Put you're shit away, you could get stomped for that

Come On
Come Oooooooonnnnnnnnn.. on.. on
