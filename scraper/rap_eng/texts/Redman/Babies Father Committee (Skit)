[Nasty Naj & Moe Green]
This is Nasty Naj on WDEF
Today, I'm representing for all the bitches
Interviewing those no good niggas that father our children
In the house today, we have a young man by the name of Moe Green, the president of the My Baby Father Committee
How you doin' today, Moe?
I'm alright
And how many kids do you have, Moe?
I think I got about 11
You think you have 11
And how many babies' mothers do you have?
I guess 11
You guess 11, okay
And do you take care of any of these kids or are you married to any of these mothers?
Hell no! Them bitches just wanted to have a baby by me
Because they heard I'm the muthafuckin' man
And to make it plain, it's just like Dre said:
"Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks"
Well ladies, you heard it straight from the president of the My Baby Father Committee
They ain't shit, y'all ain't shit, and your motherfuckin' kids ain't shit
Signing off on WDEF, this is Nasty Naj
