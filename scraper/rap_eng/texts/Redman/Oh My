Make her say oh my every time i ride by
She like the way the jet black cadillac shine
(ma-make her say)3 (oh my)3

Yeah yo i hop out my ride im lookin fly
Come ride the pony but im nuttin like genuine

Now im tryna smoke with Obama at the pentagon

Make her say oh my every time i ride by she like the way the candy apple cadillac shine (ma-make her say)3 (oh my)3
