[Hook]
My vision gettin' clearer, I'm lookin' in the mirror
I'm sayin' to myself: "That's a fly nigga."
Harlem is the city, got all my niggas with me
You know that they get busy (Let's ride, nigga!)
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee dah, daditty dah dee day
You niggas know I'm hot, right?
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee day, daditty dah dee day
You tryin' to take my spot, right?

[Verse 1: Loaded Lux]
Play the bench, the starters is stayin' in
My thinkin' cap on, I'm 'bout ready to raise the brim
Been bathin' in the money so, honey, the famous win
I got enough fans, ain't lookin' to make a friend
Bad news for niggas with rap moves
The facts prove I'm way up in the stat pool
If cash rules, the bread good, then you fast food
Thought I left, but I'm right on 'em like tattoos
Mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of all?
Maybe the monologue, or fancy designer clothes
Buyin' out the bar for baby behind the bar
So you can tell them niggas retire, I'm on my job
They want me as a martyr, drop the hem on a mama
R.I.P. out to Huddy and light a candle for Harlem
Bring the niggas that knew me and bitches that love me truly
100 bands in the box and bury me in my Gucci

[Hook]
My vision gettin' clearer, I'm lookin' in the mirror
I'm sayin' to myself: "That's a fly nigga."
Harlem is the city, got all my niggas with me
You know that they get busy (Let's ride, nigga!)
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee dah, daditty dah dee day
You niggas know I'm hot, right?
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee day, daditty dah dee day
You tryin' to take my spot, right?

[Verse 2: Redman]
All my fans say "Fuck you!" in they fan mail
‘Cause I had they main girl on a hand-held
I go to the store, they try to pop my fan-belt
Then I body 'em in the street like Cornbread Earl
Boy, I'm that thorough, I'm like a pitbull
Windex in the pen to make it crystal
170, but in rap I'm a big dude
So yeah, I got bars, like a Gym Room
Boy, I'm that dirty, so tell the rap jury
That tennis the only way a nigga gon' serve me
My black MAC Bernie, I even mack siri
Shit, I'm killin' the mic like Conrad Murray
Get your weight up, boy, you wan' hustle with it
Even my protein bars got muscle in it
Pop my trunk, pop yours, nothin' in it
I'm cool, so hold up, wait a minute!

[Hook]
My vision gettin' clearer, I'm lookin' in the mirror
I'm sayin' to myself: "That's a fly nigga."
Harlem is the city, got all my niggas with me
You know that they get busy (Let's ride, nigga!)
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee dah, daditty dah dee day
You niggas know I'm hot, right?
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee day, daditty dah dee day
You tryin' to take my spot, right?

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Lux, I'm loaded, 'bout ready to spit a verse
On haters I unloaded, be ready to get his hearse
I'm 'bout to send him notice if Harlem don't get him first
Send him down to unemployment
‘Cause homie gon' get this work
Hot Benz, every honey is top ten
If she hops in, then more than likely we not friends
Look, I'm locked in, hit you like Skelly, your top spin
First I pop, then I'm out, like Pirelli's on stock rims
Flyest in the game, still applyin' the pain
Since Milk was Top Billin' and Lyte was ridin' the train
These paperthin villains get scraped and thrown in the flame
85% of rappers is fake and so is they chain
Now, that's a no-brainer, 36 in my chamber
Now a moment of silence, I throw a L up for Banga
Lyricist, not a singer, don't ever forget it's gangsta
Ladies, they get the thumbs up, coppers just get the finger

[Hook]
My vision gettin' clearer, I'm lookin' in the mirror
I'm sayin' to myself: "That's a fly nigga."
Harlem is the city, got all my niggas with me
You know that they get busy (Let's ride, nigga!)
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee dah, daditty dah dee day
You niggas know I'm hot, right?
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee day, daditty dah dee day
You tryin' to take my spot, right?
