[Intro: Redman (Method Man) {stage people}]
D.C. make some God damn noise
{You got, you got Meth mic, right?}
{We can only fix one mic at a time}
{Ok, he got Meth, mic?}
(Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome you)
(To the Redman & Method Man show)
Yes sir, yes sir

[Redman]
Yo, when you see smoke in the air
Two hot boys that put coke in your ear
Fuck pimp, I wanna get dope of the year
Til I die and I smoke with Aaliyah
Boost my career, and bare arms heavy
What you trynna get, I was there already
Yeah, I'm a wise ass, take one to know one
Asshole Academy, yeah I'm the spokesman
Talk that greasy, on the north TV
Even pigs love the Boss Hog CD
What you find hard, I do it easy
I can see why the next guy wanna be me
Yeah, I'm a problem, ya'll can't solve 'em
Straight up bitch like Cartman mama
Keep a 'brown fox' like the 'ill na na'
B.O. 2, bitch, we bring the drama

[Hook: Redman]
How the fuck ya'll feeling tonight?
How the fuck ya'll feeling tonight? For real

[Method Man]
Yup, I think my mind playing tricks on me
I hold the weight like my name set the smith on me
It's Meth & Doc, nigga, back on that, homey
Back on the strip, how many women wanna strip for me?
This nigga spit, don't he? My flow is heavy
As Katrina when she broke the levy's, real as they get, whoadie
Ya'll better get to know me, I'm top notch
Got a thing for the top spot, too hot for you to hold me
When niggas ugly you gotta cut me a dime
Little Asian honey is funny, she love me long time
Get this money, if you don't mind, got money on my mind
Cuz I'm hungry, never dummy, the sun forever shine, nigga
If you rolling with us, then throw your hands up
We need Bricks and Staten Island to stand up
Here's your chance, my niggas, go 'head and man up
Blunt Brothers, see we at a level they can't touch

[Hook: Redman]
How the fuck ya'll feeling tonight?
How the fuck ya'll feeling tonight? For real

[Redman] (Method Man) {both}
Yo, Redman (Method Man) back in the building
(We can ship gold) fuck one million
(Underground rap) That's what you hearing
{Middle finger up like fuck ya'll feelings}
{Yeah, yeah, fuck ya'll feelings}
That's how it sound when them boys be wheeling
{Yeah, yeah, fuck ya'll feelings}
(Niggas can't eat, then it's back to robbing and stealing)
Give it up, nigga!
