[Intro] X3
Straight up weed, no angel dust
They label us "notorious"
My my they’re breathing oxygen
From so much smoke need oxygen

[Verse 1]
Hey y'all, back here to break y'all off
When I ride like Akon and Jeezy, look on the TV
I ain’t Nicholas when I face off
AR make a nigga go AWOL
Believe me, yall don’t wanna see me
I be on board like Luigi
I stay alive like a Bee Gee
3D, not gonna go hard
When I just pop from the Mohawk
Slick talk I gotta get a whole walk
She like Batman, think he a know it all
Get slapped like Nikolai Volkoff
Cuz I’m like Hugh Hefner when the robe off
Bitch I’m just younger
With the pretty cucumber
Like Biz I’mma go up
Nigga like me cock the hammer
Til my block demand a new boss I’mma stand up
I just juice like Tropicana
And give up my grandma for some rhymes like Electra
DT’s when I pop the 10
It’s cuz I’m bananas, just giving you a heads up
Boy I’m sick, I don’t need a checkup
‘Cause I’m on your mind when you air walk

[Hook]
My my they’re breathing oxygen
From so much smoke need oxygen
Straight up, leave no angel dust
Label us notorious

[Verse 2]
Eyes low, bossed up like the MG
Rolled looking outsides like young Z
I don’t like them broads, they can run free
Why pay for the pussy when it come free
I ain’t playin with yo pussy, wanna come see?
4-5, black inners in the Humvee
Keep these rap niggas under my wing
It’s an underground thing, shout to Pimp C and Bun B
Smoked that ever since snoop it
Since then I ain’t felt y'all using
I’m a pain in the ass, I’m a nusaince
Not poppin off til you hear my true sense
Two thoughts sittin in the new Porsche
New face, we chase at a new court
Got the hoes from the stable like Too $hort
Got the O’s on the table by the new book
Got the gran' coup sittin by the notebook
Old jams, bump for the all group
Backwood to the group when you smoke kush
And my blood Obama, it ain’t no Bush
Chew my weed like president, no trash
Back it up, move it out, better go fast
One forth QBs and a old half
Niggas know what it is but I won’t pass

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I’m the king of the kush and I gets no higher
More smoke in this room than a full long fire
Niggas talkin shit but your board game tired
Next dude try the shit, get your jaw rewired
Niggas beat your bubble with they urban flows
But I’mma murder this, shoot it 'til the curtain close
I rep Brick City 'til I die
Notorious, motherfucker, like I'm B.I.G
Visions is you really wanna doubt
You can lean to the south, put yo' mouth on my tip
See it’s quite evil, you can’t see my team
Nobody quite do it like I did
Bitch, you claim of the name and I’m better than most
Still razor sharp quote to competitors’ throats
Call it assault how I fuck up the beat
And ain't any other rapper here fuckin' with me
Now check the codename is Mr. Die
See these niggas can’t touch me, gotta stay more calm
I’m a beast, I destroy any beats on my path
I mention the deceits, come and whip em in half
See they don’t know that my words don’t play
And how they put together just to murder my prey
Alright alright alright, these bitch ass niggas gon' know today

[Hook]
