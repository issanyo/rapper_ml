[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Saukrates!

[Hook: Saukrates]
Have you ever been so proud in your life
You living on your own cloud in the sky
Wanna take everybody with you
Forget one, let me get two

[Verse 1]
I love travelling and seeing people
Showing the ignorant my color skin is equal
I like trying different Thai food and seafood
Making my episode of life another sequel
I like flying on Delta and Continental
First class, playing 'em elevator instrumentals
I'm in the window, got on my headphones
Listening to Big Pun and Wyclef Jean
It's like Exxon, I get gassed up
I shuffle 'round the board like Cassius
That's us when the plane land, hey man
It ain't hard cause I can do it like a caveman
Fix my Ray-Bans, I hit the hotel
Do my show, get my money, hit the hotel
Sitting at the hotel like "Oh well!"
I call shorty that I met today at Modell's
Go girl, it's like we in The Matrix
I'm in a new city, with suitcases
I'm overseas with bills with new faces
And if you're not about that you need a facelift, yup

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Saukrates]
If it's a high life you seeking then you say it
Cause how the hell you gonna win the game if you ain't playing?
I'm in Monaco, swimming in the deep end with 3 dimes, this ain't dominos
Well maybe it was, I set 'em up to knock 'em down and go
The skeletons in the closet, I'm making a new deposit
She was never so erotic 'til we got to the exotic..tic
Now I'm thinking that this time bomb is about to explode
Got me wishing that it was different than money, contradiction is funny
I just told y'all to play the game if y'all wan' eat
The truth is it's what you make it, that's why I got my baby girl naked
Long before I bought them tickets to Turks and Caicos
We love each other, beyond under covers
That's why I'm feeling so high like them Wright brothers
Fly, I hope it never take material
For you to get your Apple Jacks cereal (Here we go)

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm on vacation, bitch! And I'm flying high
