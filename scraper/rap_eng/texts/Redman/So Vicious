Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah!  Gilla nigga in the house nigga
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, oh shit!  Yo, DJ Envy in the house nigga
{New Redman!}  "You, are, so, vi-cious"
Yeah, Brick City's in the house nigga
(Chick-chicken, DJ Envy muh'fuckin set boy!) "I, know, you're, vi-cious"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what?
(Check it out -- scream at your dog) {WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?}

[Redman]
Aiyyo Dog you gotta be a gilla nigga, to roll with us
A camp full of hardhitters, with no quitters
Smackin the shit out golddiggers when the dough mentioned
Take out a new nigga rap, with a old symptom {ENVY!}
Yeah I'm Doctor Dude from "Malpractice"
Half you rappers ain't on crack, you just crackers {Yeah!}
And backwards, I was forward when I wrote it
So when I spit I'll chip a few niggas shoulders
I want dough, you're only penny like bologna
Haters watch y'all know they +Envy+ when the song bump
Talkin bout they in the hood, where they hardly found
The whole hood got my number - CALL MI NAOW!
I ain't gon' read your palm, I know your future
Only thing I need was the street you're on
Now parked on your lawn is, two Denalis
Niggas squattin with gloves and, Bruno Malis
New York and Cali, we don't play fair
If it's thick we rob chicks for they J-Lo wear (give it up bitch!)
Give it to they baby moms, and say it's a gift
Cause when I ball in my palm, I'ma play it to win - c'mon

[Chorus]
"You, are, so, vi-cious"
Yea, yea, yea, yo, Redman is
"I, know, you're, vi-cious"
Ha, ha, yo, yea, yo, yo, Brick City is
"You, are, so, vi-cious"
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, DJ Envy is
"I, know, you're, vi-cious"
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, scream atcha frauds

[Redman]
I gotta, watch where I'm goin, start goin where I watch
It's summertime, but it's like snowin in my watch
Check the Funk Doc, the Lyor Cohen of the block
2020 Benz unfoldin out the box {yup!}
Futuristic kid, fuck if your team holdin
I'm shittin on y'all and I ain't begin to clean colon
I'll snatch the crown from whatever king holdin
The unforgettable, Nat King Flow'n
+Jack the Rapper+ like a conference
I'm passin out demo tapes with shotties under the armpits
(Give it up!) Tellin you to listen to it, or you die young
My music like ecstacy - EVER TRY ONE?
Throw your guns, it's a law to bein men
And I'm that all day, like the war on CNN
I turn your day to short, make the night go long
I got Doug E. sayin, "Reggie - on the mic - you're on!"
(Ahh ahh on, ahh ahh on..)

[Chorus] w/ variations

{Envy ad libs shoutouts to Def Squad}

[Redman]
Where you at where you at?
Def Squad, DJ Envy, Gilla niggas
Brick City, Brook-nam in the hid-douse
With a dick in your mid-douth
2002, fuck whatchu gon' do
Word to mother

[Envy] Y'all know - switch it up!
