[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Check it out
Redman [?] twenty two on a car tire
Ring bells like Hell's Diner
I'm sharp hair made of barbed wire
[?] nicotine for your menthol on Crenshaw
43rd fresh off the [?]
I got connects like SIM cards
I know hip-hop is part of my life
I love it like it's my wife
My credit card that I swipe
True Religion's all on my Nikes
7:30 train wreck, brain freeze
I'm Capo, Marvel, got the Iron Man, Stan Lee

[Hook]
I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I get it, who can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I can't stop like Diddy Boi when I'm grindin'
I hold down Brick City boy and Shaolin
These hoes rub they titties boy when I'm driving
My boys smoking that loud when we be wild'n

[Verse 2]
Sour diesel, medicate
Start a cypher, elevate
Fuck the hater, eliminated
These angry birds is feather weight
Hood down, street smart
With a cap 'n gown, class clown
Failed math but graduated from a dime bag to a half a pound
90 era is harder
Orca out the water
'for Wayne started the Carter
Before T-Pain did the auto
I had lyrics, nigga
Drunk as hell, I spit the liquor, Dirk Diggler
I kick it off like Monday night
Then run it back like Emmit Mister

[Hook]

[Outro]
Copy that, copy that, copy that

[Skit]
