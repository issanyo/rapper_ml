[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You in my lane boy, move over
The blunts are bigger, the weed got a new odor
Get back to your job fucking up food orders
Me, middle finger's up rockin' new Jordans
The streets listenin' but I ain't listenin'
Unless Puffy make a Biggie album, he live again
White people love the flow so they river dance
Hoes wanna hate, I skip-skip-skip again
What up to Killa Kam boy I'm on that grandaddy
So I can look gorillawhen it's starin' at me
I talk cocky like Freddie Blassie
My backwood residue is like teriyaki
She said "Stop, no don't" I said "No, don't stop"
Look at me, I got my niggas and my city on top
I'ma say yes, what the fuck you mean, yo
I'm a bad boy tryna get all in your ringtone like

[Hook]
Everybody know when you stack your bucks
You gotta ride around with your middle fingers up
Now let it go, now let it go, now let it go
And I'ma go head roll somethin'
Now if you're ridin' in your truck with your systems up
Blunts rolled and your girl with a big ole butt
Now let it go, now let it go, now let it go
And I'ma go head smoke somethin'

[Verse 2]
I hustle hard for I try to get a quick meal
I throw my hood up like I'm on one wheel
I let it go, middle finger in the air when I'm riding in my truck
When I see your bitch, done deal
That's why I'm going hard like Garnett
I say when it's over, until then all net
I ain't had a chance to shut down the mall yet
Ellis let's get this money, I'm on it
I'm jeans and hoodie maybe a little Louis
My family, guy, they think like little Stewie
That's why we fly to Miami just to get groupies
I said "Mommy, let's make a movie"
She said "Stop, no don't" I said "No, don't stop"
Look at me, I got my niggas and my city on top
I'ma say yes, what the fuck you mean, yo
I'm a bad boy tryna get all in your ringtone like

[Hook]

[Outro]
Put your middle fingers up in the air
Put your middle fingers up in the air

[Skit]
