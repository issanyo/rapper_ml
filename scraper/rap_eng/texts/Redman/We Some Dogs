[Hook: Mr. Porter]
If I'm a dog, then we some dogs
We all gunna chase cats, tell them dog
Girl don't waste that swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
If I'm a dog, then we some dogs
We all gunna chase cats, tell them dog
Girl don't waste that swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs

[Verse 1: Method Man]
By any means necessary, it's on
Bitch, your fucking with a dog, all I wanna do is bury some bones
Take a piss on a tree and I'm gone
Girlfriend don't get it wrong
I hate to be the one to shit on your lawn
But I ain't got my dog license I ain't nothing nice
And I ain't never met a piece of pussy I ain't liking
Sugar and spicing
Kicked up with ice and
You can do anything with these hoes
Except housewife them
Like snoop said "it ain't nothing but a G thing"
Got a bitch in my bed, in nothing but a g-string, so peep game
Who the lucky female to taste these
Snips and snails and puppy dog tails huh?
You're messing with me, I'm messing with you
I'm a dog trick I chase cats like Peppy La Pu
Dead on shit My life's like a Holiday Inn
If my girl act up I'm gunna fuck her friend
If I'm a what...

[Verse 2: Redman]
I'm a dog motherfucker, I walk on all fours
Find where you live at, shit on your porch, Redman is hungry
Don't leave the food out, I'm pumped like a Pamela Anderson boob job
Straight up bulldog, mixed with a Shizhsu
Cause I bullshit, party a little bit
Swim with the shark, you're bound to drown
My weed is like green, and yours brown
The doctor the dog, from Cali to Georgia
When cats meow with noting on top they halter
I don't have Yesmen that laugh when I laugh
We some dogs, we can kiss our own ass
Like a golden retriever, retrieving the chronic
The dose nose bitch, and no need to hide it - Redman a flirt
Always get my nuts stuck to the porch, like the dog on Joe Dirt

[Hook: Mr. Porter]

Girl don't waste that swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
If I'm a dog, then we some dogs
We all gunna chase cats, tell them dog
Girl don't waste that swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Fish don't fry in the kitchen, bitch don't climb, keep bitching
Beans don't burn on the grill, 3, 4, 5
With the pimping, hoes get your pimps permission
Now pay attention, the big D-O double to the G-O
To the liquor store to crack a ho and get some VO (VO)
And mix it with some pena colidino
Then slip it on the bitch then I dip with all her c-notes
Scandalous, yep bitch cause we know
Every pretty ho always down to pull a d-low
On me? No, so there won't be no shaking me down, breaking me down, here we go
You know I'm just oh so slick
The way you chew that bubble gum, the way you sucking a dick
And I can tell, that you a freak
I wanna stick some dick up in you can I skeet, skeet
Don't you know why?
