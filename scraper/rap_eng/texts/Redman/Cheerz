I said I'm..
I'ma.. great white on the mic, servin fishscale
Livin life like I co-star with Denzel
Hip-hop been my life since kids meals
Lee jeans, label blocks and Big Wheels (uhh)
Ever since then I've been a FUCKIN problem
Feelin like Bruce Wayne, and this is Gotham
Now I got them haters watchin
Waitin for my next hit like a nigga boxin
(And the NEWWW~!) On this mic you can see I'm blessed
Some say I'm the One like KRS
Shoutout to Clue, Flex and Doo Wop
R.I.P. Big L, Pun, Biggie and 2Pac
Flow so sick somebody give me a flu shot (achoo)
I'm well done, overcooked, too hot
A booth, ProTools and a MP
That's all I need to show you that I'm a emcee (yessir!)
So you can chase the fame, cause simply
Difference is, you a Beamer, I'm a Bentley - dummy!
Now wonder where I'd be without Funk Doc
So this toast goes to Redman and hip-hop (yo)

[Hook: Ready Roc] + (Redman) + {Melanie}
Whattup Big Unc? (Whattup nephew?)
WHATTUP JERSEY? {Jersey, Jersey-ayyyyy}
(Check mic one) Check mic two
YEAH THEY HEARD ME..
How y'all feel? (Drinks on me!)
NOW WHO THIRSTY? {whoahhh-ohhhh}
(Cheers! This ones her for hip-hop)
HI-HI-HIP-HOP

[Interlude: Melanie Rutherford]
This is my life - this is my life baby
We gon' do it like this nigga

[Redman]
Yo, watch out now I talk like a old man
But still got that UHH like Jor-dan
Call in, anywhere I go it's CHEERS
Cause they yell my name like Nor-man
Walk in, look cool
Flow like the ink pen got Red Bull
Feel like I'm school, back to the basics
Handcuffin hip-hop, niggas start rapin (yessir)
And I faced it, it's a new ballgame
It's like when +Baby Boy+ met Ving Rhames
Now that's so appealin, the veteran
Still trappin, I'm back in the building
Yeah I laugh when I'm yakkin to children
But it's hard when ya boy lackin a million
I'm so brilliant, cause I work the Eastside
And do the same damn thing on the Westside (West coast!)
For hip-hop I'mma die - you fuck with it?
I'm O-Dog, I ain't lettin that shit ride!
Whoever outside with a eardrum
Old people, young people, here it come

[Hook]

[Interlude: Melanie] + (Redman)
This is my life (yo, watch out now)
Hip-Hop (yessir, yo neph' I got it nigga)

[Redman]
Yo, aiyyo neph' you can tell I love hip-hop
And me stoppin any time? I think not
Whip, the opposite of a hard top
Summertime, my rhyme's in your droptop
Yeah, the LP is "Reggie"
I got the goods baby, I'm Don Ready
Ready, for any hip-hop freak
Even white chicks want black in 'em like Pernelli
Yeah, the rap game is star studded
It's like the NBA, you gotta love it

[Ready Roc]
Whattup Big Unc? Watch nephew
Sell more records than Wyclef crew (ill)
Haters watch me ball like the ref do
And still can't get it right like a left shoe (hahahaha)
I'm 'bout to bubble like a Lex Coupe
"What's my motherfuckin name?" like I'm Big Snoop
Ready Roc hear the crowd scream
Now my name hold weight like a triple beam
Wu-Tang showed me how to get the C.R.E.A.M
I'm a microphone, I'm a microphone fiend

[Hook]

[Melanie Rutherford]
This is my life, this is my life
Hip-Hop, until I dieeeeee
Until I die, whoaaaaaa-ohhhhhh
Ooooo-hooo-hooooo
Cause this is my life, my life
Hip-Hop, until I diiiiieeee
Yeah yeah yeah
