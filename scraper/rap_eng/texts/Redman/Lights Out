Redman and Jayceeoh
International dudes ya know?
When it comes to this 1000volts shit?
We go all out

Good buds, hard work
Nice women, give me that, I'm satisfied
Overtime, stage shows
A lot of stress, for this job I'm qualified
My fam first, fuck with my money
Tryin' to leave me broke? It could be a homocide
I'm borderline, 7:30
We could all go through some shit that leave you traumatised
That's why I'm livin my life like Imma die tomorrow
And you never seen me stressin I made it camoflauged
I'm a real hitter you can count on me like ??
My roof cut, on the 101 that Cali ??
I go to sleep, wake up smilin cause I got my health
Have an attitude its like a missin lighter check yourself
I came from the bottom, roaches and rats in the cabinet
