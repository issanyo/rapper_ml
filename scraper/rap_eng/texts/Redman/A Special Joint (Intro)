Do you want to get high man?

[Method Man]
Does Pinocchio have wooden balls man?

[Redman]
Well yo, I got a joint I've been saving here for a special occasion

[Method Man]
Ah, niggas, bitches, welcome
A full tank of gas, a pound of weed, a bird called Pinky
To the east, driver to the east
Funk doctor and the phenom
By the way, this is protected by the red
The track and tical with the key

[Redman]
Oh shit, where the keys at?
