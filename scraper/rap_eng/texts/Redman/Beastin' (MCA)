[Verse 1]
Yo, Redman got the blunts, let's get it in
That's why these women's asses jiggling
I'm like a pornstar fuckin' in my Timbalands
Sex drugs and money bitch get your membership
Watch how I [?] bro
Watchin' Rambo in a Lambo
They say a nigga hot, can't put him out
Smoke weed in the club, let's put him out
I got women gimme head on the e-pill
And I'm like "There you go" like Johnny Gill
Behind the wheel is even better
And if it gets warm, take off your hot sweater
I see your tits through it anyway baby
The boomin' system got 'em jingling baby
They said I couldn't do it but I fooled 'em all
Had to play Tony Danza like "Who's the boss?"
I'm in Jamaica mile high with a mai tai
Good fella with the hoes, yeah I'm a wise guy
That's why I act a fool
And I'm cool, I take these youngins back to school

[Hook]
Like yeah, I got bad women ridin' with me like yeah
They got their own money and they hit me like yeah
They buy their own car and they ridin' like yeah
I told 'em give me something, they was with it like yeah
Yeah [?] nigga like he putting in work
Work hard to play hard, watch how I flirt
Streets'll love you but they'll want you in the dirt
That's why I grab on my...

[Verse 2]
Yo, got the Ciroc and pineapple, pour it in
Got it flowing like the levee in New Orleans
Out the club to my car, ladies all in
Going up in iHop in the morning
Women love Red, they doing cartwheels
Even got red bottoms on their high heels
Your boy heavyweight, get the picture
Seven point zero I scale on the richter
Hit the gym, get a little work out
Grab the mic, put a little work out
NWKNJ
Real hip-hop here, no DJ hittin' the replay
Look at that boy, he showing off
Go tell Biz Markie I'm goin' off
Radio playing that bullshit
So I resurrect Guru then give him a full clip
Give him another one then another one
Jersey got bank, I'ma double 'em
This kind of rhyme you won't find in a Target or Walmart in aisle nine
I be lying if I ain't saying I ain't one of the best
Is your career over nigga, guess what

[Hook]
