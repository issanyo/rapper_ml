Cause mayne, I run thangs like creamed corn

Heavy on the black like ebony
Money in the bank? Yeah boy, it better be
70's baby, check out my melody
Places I be at? Y'all don't be there
Too busy up in the club drinkin Pierre
Hoods love me, and the people in Italy yeah
Only way you get through the hood is through e-mail
Number one, boy on the tranks, I rank on it

And where I be, you niggas got bank on it
Spit hot shit like the mic got a make on it

Yo, when I'm in N.Y., I'm Uptown
On 1-4-5 fresh pair of Uptowns
I just scored me a mami, touchdown
Original, Gunn Clappah, Bucktown
Ohhh! I love to kick it in Cali
My Compton girl tattooed me on her fatty
She said, "I know you've got hoes in the Valley
Kris Kross me you gon' see the Mack Daddy"
I said yo, I gotta go to Miami
But my boys sold pounds so I'd feel a little milli'
I bagged me a XXL, +Eye Candy+
A little bling bling got me +Fresh+ like +Mannie+
I ride through the A with a chick, dirty
Southside Philly know I get it on early
Any hood I'm in, I'm never in a hurry
I stand there chest out, and I rep Jersey
