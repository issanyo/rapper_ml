[Basically] (24X)

[Verse 1]
Oh shit! Hey dudes my interludes
More fatter than most niggas LP's, so don't sell me the stale cheese
I'm more nicer than Little Red Robin Hood's grandmama
Puffing on ganja, sipping on a, Cherry Bianca
My grand finale's like an alley when it's rowdy
Kick more bars than the penile G and let my nine cock loudly
Click click, bee-yow, bang, booyaka, what am I do to ya?
It's something new to ya, like screwing ya, all over my studi-ah
Ride on my MP-60 and let the S-950 squeeze your titties
That quickly I hooked you, now fix me with your lips b
-atch, unloosen my belt thinking to grab the crotch
But before you do move my Glock before it shoot my cock

[Bridge]
And see basically them trick bitches get no dap (word)
And see basically Redman album is no joke (word)
And see basically I don't get caught up at my label (word)
Cause I kill when they fuck with food on my dinner table (word)

[Verse 2]
I drop a punchline at lunchtime, cause I'm a Close Encounter
Of the None Kind with dumb rhymes, I battle all of y'all at one time
So fuck all you fools out there with the large vocabulary
In your sentence, I don't need that shit to pay my rent with, huh
And to the nosey snake-ass hoes I ask you
Why you be acting all fly when your monkey-ass work at fast food?
And why is it everytime that a multi-platinum artist
Always use the underground to make a comeback?
Is it fair to the hardcore niggas that rap?
That don't give a fuck about the radio plus the next bitch at that?
And being hardcore and mad about wearing high-tech boots and black skully hats?
And making fake-ass frowns because your best buddy packs?

[Outro]
Think about it
Sip on a chocolate thai, and let your brain fall out of focus
This is another episode, coming live from the Funkadelic man himself
