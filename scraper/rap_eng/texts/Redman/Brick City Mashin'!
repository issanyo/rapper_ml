Yo, yo, yo, nigga
* monkey noises in background *
Swinging through the forests of the jungles
* monkey noises in background *
Yo, c'mon, c'mon, yo yo, yo

Yo, look around your seats;
Do you see anybody weirder than me? (me..)
When you find him then I try him, fry him like the grill
At Benihana's to hebrew?? how to be an MC (cee.. cee..)
Sheeyit, take two tokes, I'm dope riding over notes
Overload your periscope, Doc da most
Lock and load with the rock'n'roll star, dozed off
I had him bruised and closed off with one phone call (brring!)
Chickens, mida mida the heater, believe-a I'm a dog
Straight labrador chedda retriever
Let the gorillas out, til the blood is spilling out
Put a slug up in his mouth, then the thug is chicken out (ha ha)
Darkrooms get ignited, bright lights on the mic
So when we battle they can via satellite it
PPP draft pick is massive, athlete Tenactin flow
Doc captain up battin! Brick City Mashin'!

Turn it up! (c'mon) Smoke that shit up! (c'mon)
Take money money! (c'mon) Brick City Mashin'! (c'mon)
Stolen cars! (c'mon) Counterfeit bills! (c'mon)
Freak that shit out! (c'mon) Brick City Mashin'! (c'mon)
Two for fives! (c'mon) Push that shit out! (c'mon)
Let the monkey out nigga! (c'mon) Brick City Mashin'! (c'mon)
Freak that bitch out! (c'mon) Smoke that weed out! (c'mon)
Freak that ho out! (c'mon) Brick City Mashin'! (c'mon)

Say I am .. (I am..) some-bo-dy! (Some-bo-dy)
Say I am .. (I am..) some-bo-dy! (Some-bo-dy)

Yo, yo-yo, I'm from Da Bricks where the weed go
For two for five dick.. you try this
I promise I'll be at your video, smackin the shit out of you
From crew to hairstylists (lists.. lists..)
Guerilla maneuver on an intruder
I pack like Sinbad pack the house in Aruba (chk-chk)
Blow your brains; yeah, leave the murder scene
Lookin for me is like lookin for Herb at Burger King
_I Get Around_ like 2Pac and Shock G
Fuckin hotties, block the block like Monopoly
I rock with an eighty-watt spitter, block lit up
Snatch profit up, get your Benz lock it up
So which nigga got a dope enough spot?
Call X to shut em down and I'll open up shop (shop, shop)
PPP draft pick is massive, athlete Tenactin flow
Doc captain up battin! Brick City Mashin'!

Turn it up! (c'mon) Smoke that shit up! (c'mon)
Take money money! (c'mon) Brick City Mashin'! (c'mon)
