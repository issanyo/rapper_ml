[Intro: Redman]
Uhh
I'm ready, I'm ready.. (yeah!)
I'm ready (what's up?)
I'm ready (what's good?)
I'm ready (you know I'm feelin real high)
I'm ready..
I'm ready (I'm ready)
I'm ready (I'm good)
I'm ready (let's go!)

[Poo Bear]
When the lights (lights) go off (go off)
You're feenin once you had a chance
That's why I (I) just (just) can't (can't) leave it alone
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

[Redman]
Gilla House niggas! Yo
Hip-Hop has been my callin, ever since that I was crawlin
E. Sermon start recordin, 9-2 started ballin
Yeah, whoever woulda knew, a hot man like me survivin
Recession may have you down, a boy like me keep on ridin
I, I keep on ridin, New Jersey hold me down
No sense to blame Bin Laden, when the bomb right here in town
Y'all just didn't recognize, but I'm hopin now you know
Everybody tellin lies but y'all gonna feel

[Chorus: Poo Bear (Redman)]
When the lights, go off
You're feenin once you had a chance
That's why I (yeah) just (yeah) can't, leave it alone
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

[Redman]
Let's get it! Hey, yo
Some rappers say they had it, I feel I'm gettin started
Got a little bit of change in my hand, Obama's now in office
So "no" is not an option, my heart is pumpin hunger
Your money's dial tone, got it? Wrong number!
I, I need my paper, gotta keep my lights on
I'm buildin somethin major, so I can count my acres (yes!)
Better recognize, hip-hop I love it mayne
For the music I will die and y'all gonna feel

[Chorus]
[Redman]
Ha ha, yo
My boys said I done it, I told 'em I ain't finished
My skill's Bout It Bout It, but the money, (No Limit)
Gotta keep my nose in it, cause I plan to make a killin
Instead of sittin 'round, tryin to whip, makin millions
I, I love my job, I, I love my life
If, if God my witness, I feel I did it twice (yes!)
Better recognize, Reggie is goin forward
Baby when I'm lock and loaded, y'all gonna feel

[Chorus - 2X]
[Redman]
Ay, ay, ay, I'm, I'm ready
I'm, I'm ready
I'm, I'm ready (I'm ready)
I'm, I'm ready
I'm, I'm ready, can put the whole world in my hands
Yes sir, let me at you
When the lights go out, and we got a plan
I got one ready, can put the whole world in my hands
If that plan fails, I take another route
I'm always ready, when the lights go out, out, out, out
Believe me I'm always ready
When the lights go ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-out, out, out
Believe me I'm always ready, when the lights go out, out

[Chorus]
[Outro: Redman]
Watch me, watch me, watch me (yes sir!)
Reggie Noble in the buildin
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
Poo Bear on the vocal chords, what's GOOD?
King David on the track, what's happenin my dude?
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
Yeah, yeah, signin off 2025
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
We love you, we love you
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
