(Intro)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Black by popular demand
The nigga with the most weed
The nigga with them bars (real shit nigga)
Reggie Noble (Let's go nigga)

[Verse 1]
I call my gun Jackie Brown, I'll let the dog out
You'll get found in the trunk, just like Beaumont
My happy levels at a low count (yeah)
I cut niggas in two, it's like a movie how I pair 'em out
These fat women give me love, and they salary
Take they money, buy bud, and burn calories
I got a hashtag
I'm back for errybody washing they feet and face with the same wash rag
Light-skin back, I flash gamma
This old lady on crack flow, bitch pardon my bad grammar
I take a picture of my balls, with a fan's camera
I stay on tilt like Santana bandana
I got that purp like Minnesota fans
Got sharp sixteens, I wrote 'em with Logan hands
I get it live, give me five
Go against me, you DiCaprio, you'll barely survive
You want that hard shit? Call us
When I was born, I slept with my fists balled up nigga
And you can ask Mario, I'm on that extra
I keep the gas on me, you move like a Tesla
I walked in fucked up, I'ma leave fucked up
Ain't no tellin' how I move (yeah)
And if the crowd wanna see a nigga gassed up
Then bring that ass, baby this is what I do (what you do?)

[Chorus]
I tear it up (I tear it up)
I tear it up (I tear it down)
I tear it up (I tear it up)
I tear it up (I tear it down)
I tear it up (I tear it up)
I tear it up (I tear it down)
I tear it up (I tear it up)
I tear it up (I tear it down)

[Verse 2]
Ayo
Niggas follow in my trail, you not ready
Women want it all in they mouth, it's Akinyele
I want that car Ice Cube had, Impala Chevy
Just so I can say "Turn yo punk ass over!"
Bottom of the 9th, I'm giant, Willie Hayes under pressure
When I'm done, you'll get a blood diamond
That's why I act so cocky in my interview
Even Shaquille ensured me I'm the General
Streets on fire, haters wanting Red to retire
But that's an inside joke to an outsider
If I had a crippled arm, you couldn't play me
I'll run up in this bitch like, "Baby!"
Jersey boy, I'm cut from a different fabric
I could play Russian roulette with an automatic
And you can ask Mario, I'm on that extra
I keep the gas on me, you move like that Tesla
I walked in fucked up, I'ma leave fucked up
Ain't no tellin' how I move (yeah)
And if the crowd wanna see a nigga gassed up
Then bring that ass, baby this is what I do (what you do?)

[Chorus]
I tear it up (I tear it up)
I tear it up (I tear it down)
I tear it up (I tear it up)
I tear it up (I tear it down)
I tear it up (I tear it up)
I tear it up (I tear it down)
I tear it up (I tear it up)
I tear it up (I tear it down)
