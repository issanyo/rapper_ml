[Intro]

[Hook]
Fuck outside, I'm gettin' outside
Fuck outside, I'm gettin' outside
Roll through my hood in my fucked up ride
My family be stoned like sly

[Verse 1]
Boy I don't jive, my tribe gon' kick it
Syrup in the cup, no I ain't gon' sip it
Money over hoes but hoes want money
Better ask Bow-Wow for the lottery ticket
Drop my top when the sky get yellow
So like Pacquiao, I'm waiting for Mayweather
All my dogs tougher than leather
I fell like I hit my lil kid's inhaler
Franklin, Benjamins, cakes, Entamenns
Thirsty like Howell trappin' with Gilligan
Never could mimic him, I'm grade A
I'm battin' with bonds in my DNA, nigga

[Hook]
Fuck outside, I'm gettin' inside
Fuck outside, I'm gettin' inside
Roll through my hood in my fucked up ride
My family be stoned like sly
I'm so high, the chicks gon' love it
We so fly, the chicks gon' love it
Pull up to the club, I bring no luggage
'Cause when I leave here, I plan on fuckin'

[Verse 2]
Yo, ayo
Boy, I'm a winner, boy I'm a sinner
Got an antenna on the TV dinner
Strip club, I got my money on Linda
One dollar bill pill like Gold member
I'll make it rain, it's a hurricane already
True to the game like Terry
Third degree burns, the house on fire
Hustlin', compare me to Jerry McGuire
Roll that shit, light that shit
Then mac on the seem Skyped that shit
As soon as she smoke, I'ma pipe that bitch
Then put it in her bun like you like that shit
Women give me love and rappers get X
Hood status, I got stripes like the ref
Write the check and connect like nine X
When you do, add three more digits to the left
I'm like Jeter how I rock that speaker
Internet junkies are WiFi-in' ether
Look at me bro, I'm a leader
But I feel like the fat boys tryna get in the beaver
Bitches on E and my homies on percs
Horses on the car and a horse on the shirt
For now on I'ma be dirty like Mcgirt
So I bum rush the door 'til I walked in first, nigga

[Hook]
Fuck outside, I'm gettin' inside
Fuck outside, I'm gettin' inside
Roll through my hood in my fucked up ride
My family be stoned like sly
I'm so high, the chicks gon' love it
We so fly, the chicks gon' love it
Pull up to the club, I bring no luggage
Cause when I leave here, I plan on fuckin'

[Bridge]
Now I'm inside and I'm feelin' alright
And I'ma show people how to party all night
Smoke some of that, take one of those
Drink 'til the bartender yellin' "I'm closed"
Now I'm inside and I'm feelin' alright
And I'ma show people how to party all night
Smoke some of that, take one of those
Drink 'til the bartender yellin' "I'm closed"

[Outro]
