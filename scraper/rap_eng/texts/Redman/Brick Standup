I'm Biggie like son loyd, I drop 25 pounds off like
Roy jones doc gon take ya belt
I dont box in the ring I leave rings around ya hotel
And ya wife cuz, when you outta town
I'm like first draft I dont pick I choose
NBA Nothing But Ass is hitting my pool
I'm lying I'm broke but high like Tommy Chong
And the hammer on my gun be up like Fonzy's thumb
I'm a goliath, I even gave Cali tongue
Cause I was born in Bricks from outta ratty bunch
This is Hip hop its like its meat to me
And I play to finnish it strong like Mr C
This weed you talk about you popping bring em out
You smell like chronic is cause of el' in ya mouth
We be kicking ya ass D12 on the dash
While ya car is a V8 splash
When I'm done with mic create hash
J heard the verse He ain't mad
I vanish area the size of soccer field
Red handicap rockin with doctor shields
I got balls I'm above the law
My style sparks got the stash with a custom track
There ain't nuttin to fear but fear itself
Now le mme introduce you to the feel near my belt
I be uptown whattup Juelz Santana
I be in the Hood like Taliban Bandana
You  want Redman can catch me on camera
Cauze I am so cool cool cool

[Chorus]
What more can I sayyyyyyyyyyy?
Yeah Its Gilla House Motherfucker
What more can I doooooooooooo?
I gave this up to youuuuuuuuu
I know this much is truuuuuue, truuuuuuue
