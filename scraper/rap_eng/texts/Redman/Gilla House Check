[Intro] Adam F + (Redman)
Gilla fuckin' bleedin' house mate! (Yeah!)
(Gilla House!)
UK, Big Ben and all that fuckin' bullshit
(Gilla House, ya heard?)
You fucking Muppets, you fucking cunts!
(Gilla.. Gilla.. Gilla.. let's go!)

[Redman]
Yo, yo
Muscle my way in, '07's mine
Tattooed Gilla, feelin in my prime
Pull up a Coupe a color niggas can't find
Plasma TV on the mirror outside
I overdo it strong, got chicks that buck ya down
From Vietnam that look like Nia Long
I'm hot, my collar stand up like The Fonz
To hold my guns you need wet and karma bombs
You got chubby? I got chubby too
Me starve in the park, nigga you on ComicView
You funny, I flood the area tsunami
Wash out the weak niggas, then I tag 'em _Dry Me_
I'm married to the game, the bride's my music
When Brick's in the house, there's a problem Houston!
I guzzle Crunk Juice to the neck
So when I walk in the party ain't nobody gon' do shurrr
Redman in-shurrr, it's the principality
Oven like wurrrm for the lyrics I burrrn
Nigga wait your turrrn, we can battle in a second
So I can bankrupt ya like, Chapter 11
I'm the shit like Janet Jackson undressin
Believe it, when I quarterback you receive it
Same crib on MTV Cribs mine
I ain't lyin cause my eyes redder than iodine
I'm back muh'fucker, so up your chain
I'mma leave the same way I came, that's thorough
I run up in your hood like 80 deep
Have it sound like _Drumlines_ at A&T, muh'fucker

[Hook: Redman]
Gilla House - check, Def Squad - check
White tee - check, Goretex - check
When we said we number one - we lied
We number one two three four AND five
Gilla House - check, Brick City - check
89 - check, cash yo - check
"They don't give a fuck about what y'all niggas doin"
{*scratch: "Holla at your b-boy-boy!*}

[Redman]
If you find a bag of weed on the floor, pick it up
And if you find it I got 10 on the dub
I'm hard to find like pickin weed out a rug
I'm worldwide fool, I don't care about a buzz
Dawn of the Red, goin for the bread
I got pitbulls hooked on to a sled
My block'll riot like they shot Cornbread
The Pres'll find a missile with a foreign head
KABOOM! Guess who stepped in the room?
Streetsweeper out, ready to vacumn
Then all of a sudden, you get it in the end
Like Kane from Marlena cousin, I'm a menace
I was broke as hell, first time I made it
Now e'rything I own is voice activated
Boy I'm lyin, I'm just tryin to make cheddar
Cause my doorbell is rubbin two wires together

[Hook: Redman]
Gilla House - check, Wu-Tang - check
White tee - check, Nike Air - check
When we said we number one - we lied
We number one two three four AND five
Gilla House - check, Uptown - check
Purple haze - check, cash yo - check
"They don't give a fuck about what y'all niggas doin"
{*scratch: "Holla at your b-boy-boy!*}
