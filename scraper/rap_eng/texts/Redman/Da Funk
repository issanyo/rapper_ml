[Intro - Redman talking to himself]
Yo, yo, yo, check this out
Yo, yo we gon' go back to the old school right now
Yo, yo Red
Yo, what's up, G?
Yo, yo, yo, check this out
I believe there's no nigga out there as funky as you
True
So, what we're gonna do, is we're gonna go back to the old P
Funkadelic
Get the fuck outta here, word?
Remember that old cut you did?
Yeah, yeah
That ol' P-Funk cut?
Yeah, make my funk the P-Funk
Yeah, yeah, that's it
Well, what we gonna do is we gonna reminisce on that ol' shit
Word?
We gon' go right back to the old school, but before we do
I wanna know is my niggas in the house?
(HELL YEAH!)
I said is my motherfuckin' niggas in the house?
(HELL YEAH!)
So everybody just light your spliffs up
Yeah
Get your skunk weed and light that shit up
And let the funk be your guiding light
You heard it comin' from the lungs of the Funkadelic brother himself
More funk than a bag of skunk
Twice the funk than James Brown's socks
Hit me
Hittin' you straight across your mouth
Wit a tune
Yo, Redman, drop it

[Hook]
Make my funk the P-Funk
I wants to get funked up

[Verse]
Make my funk the P-Funk, we thump
Lyrics that bounce brains, make emcees jump
Sky high
Can't touch the level so why try?
Fall Guy compare me status to fly guy
Rough and rugged, and brother it takes ten to conquer
That's why I'm on probation
Ever since three, I cut throats of emcees
Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees
Of two-tens
Not from an oven, but MAC-10
A MAC-20 maybe if I didn't subtract ten
My background straight from a black man's culture
Want more? Buy the video or Redman sculpture
For your mantle, damn you
Too hard to handle
E-Double slam once, and Redman slam two
Break hooks, earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay, bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords
PE fights for power
Redman fights for soul power
Funk is strong as a tree trunk
Ask me the flavor
Make mines the P-Funk

[Hook]
Make my funk the P-Funk
I want my funk uncut (Make mine the P)
Make my funk the P-Funk (Wants to get funked up)
I wants to get funked up

[Outro]
I'm back with the funk, chump
You want funk; how many lumps?
I got spunk
I'm well-known like Donald Trump
I'm not...
