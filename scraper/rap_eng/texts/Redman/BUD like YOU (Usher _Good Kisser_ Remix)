Don't no bud get me high like you, bang, bang, bang
Don't no bud get me high like you

[Verse 1]
It's 9 in the evening
And I'm lookin' for my dealer for some bud
(Where the hell is he at?) (Heh)
And when I can't find him
I gotta use yo dealer and yo dealer sucks
(He really do sucks)

Ya dealer is a liar
Because he don't never have the fire
He always talk reckless on the wire
