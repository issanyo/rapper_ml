[Verse 1: Redman]
I got that loud, that fire in my pocket
The prez of marijuana, that's why I'm gon' Barack it
Don't knock it 'til you try it
Light it up and start a riot
When you hit my jolly green, you're fuckin' with a giant
Ladies love me like L
Call me Mr. Chip and Dale
I ain't sippin' Zinfandel, baby
I don't bodybuild
I'm lookin' for bud, they say you got it
(I ain't got it)
Yeah, you got it
Your body a [?], don't be lyin', mami
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
I got some friends, like Eminem with a chainsaw
We harassin' your girlfriends with prank calls
I know some people who wanna get high, but it ain't ya'll
Reggie actin' a fool
No way I'm gonna lose
I carry on 'til they all be laughin' at you
She got it so she give daddy half of the loot
We on tour havin' fun, what happened to you?
