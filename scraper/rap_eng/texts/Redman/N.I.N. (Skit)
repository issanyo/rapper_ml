Thanks Bill
This week on NIN, Niggers In Newark
We're gonna take you through some glorious weed spots
That my camera crew and I had a chance to visit
During our stay in Da Bricks
Although we suffered minor setback this week
When our TV satellite van was stolen
We managed to get around best way possible
We had chances to see spots like
Hawthorne Ave, Hayes Homes, South Orange Ave
Avon Ave, 19th Ave, Chancellor and Bergen
19th and One-Duke; hey if you look closely right now
There's someone about to go for their drugs
Or as they would say, stash
Hey, hey buddy, you about to sell some drugs?

Aiyyo man get the fuck out! *blam blam blam*

This here, is the telephone line
Of one of the many top notch weed sellers out of Newark
Ladies and gentlemen, what I will try to do
Is tap into the line, and hear an actual drug deal in progress
Shhh...
