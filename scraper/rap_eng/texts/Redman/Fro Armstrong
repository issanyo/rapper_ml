[Intro: Redman]
Now who, n-now who, (scratches)
Now who kicks that phenomenal astronomical? (scratches)
Funk cosmical, far from logical

[Verse 1: A-F-R-O]
Space shit, shoots over, granite moon
Aliens, rule over, Planet DOOM
5 million years since Earth extinct
Crime killing in fear, switch words in peace
I travel the expired sand
I unravel as the only man handled in entire trance
A hacksaw and a crack jaw, case and plan
I camouflage, in Asian land
I sought the wrath, I walk and glance, I follow paths
I draw a map, I caught a trap
The night grew, I see the bars
Not a light view, I'm seeing Mars, I read the stars
Lonely ruins, home is humid, no intruance
Older music, zone's grouped in home sewage
I fuck extraterrestrial hoes, impeccable flow
Blessed head full of Fro

[Hook: Samples]
Intergalactic rap shit, to listen to
A-F-R-O, astronomical
A-F-R-O, cosmical
A-F-R-O, far from logical

Intergalactic rap shit, to listen to
A-F-R-O, astronomical
A-F-R-O, cosmical
A-F-R-O, far from logical (ah)

[Verse 2: A-F-R-O]
Signs in my rhyme line invasion
I'm impatient, time is wasting, lives are taken
Rhyme occasion, save lives and thinking
Great time to take spaceship fly away with it
Rape and take green alien bitches
Break and shake the speed of alien children
I rock steady, I drop heavy, you're not ready
Rock deadly, alien shot, alien not friendly
Needing the power, breathing's beam in the hour
Humans seeing the beams of meteor showers
They have a plot, to harvest code
They wouldn't stop, 'til all our home
Robbed for all the drones
Carved a lot of skulls, to study brains
The bloody drains, same slain, the muddy days
Our home got blown, into smithereens
Our flows not known of this energy
