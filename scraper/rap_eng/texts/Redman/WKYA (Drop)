[Redman]
Yo, when I walk I stalk like a dog (AROOF!)
Writin "fuck ya hometown" on ya wall (AROOF!)
WKYA! Them niggas that'll whip out the dick
And piss ALL in your gar-ments
When I come around, son lay 'em down
This Homey the Clown play around so pay it now
Sweepin the block up, Mayor Doc, he in town
Ridin the highway at night to run a deer down; I look for the action
Funk Doc, I don't look when I'm crashin!
I'm so dope I could bundle cook-up by the aspirin
Gaspin like it's Aspen, no air
Beef we bring it on with tap shoes and hope the po'-po' there
Graduated, they said Red would go nowhere (uh-uh)
Now, SOURCE AWARDS, ride a water buffalo there
Polo Gear, holes in it, the fo'-fo' wear
Ass out, check the weather report for cold air (brrrr)
On your hottest day of the summer, I snowmobile in
Stack new jacks in the Carter, blow the building
It's WKYA muh'fucker
Bringin trouble your way, so duck muh'fucker!

Yeahh! Two-hundred and fifty-five-thousand pounds
Of guerilla shit funk fo' yo' ass motherfucker!
Bricks to Brook-nam, we hold it down, PPP Def Squad
Ya tell me once and I'll tell you again
Pull out the mac-10 and rob yo' friend, yeahhh!
(Fucker) WKYA (We kickin yo' ass)
