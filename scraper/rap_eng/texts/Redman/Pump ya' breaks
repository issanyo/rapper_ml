[Redman: verse 1]

Yeah, yo,  My name is R to the E, D, M, A, N , I'm back in your hood, bitch, tell your friend's
I pull up in my whip, and I'm high as shit, my ashtray still gotta' half a clip
I jump out my ride, and I hit the store
I spotted girlfriend that I hit before
I'm rocking on, to the break a dawn
And if you're smoking like me, blow your horns

[Chorus by Redman]
Pee,peep. home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks

WATCH OUT! Watch out! Yeah
Peep, peep, home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks

[Redman: verse 2]


I popped' on a L, then we hit the spot
Fly chicks pullin' up in the parking lot
Chick roll down the windows say "Who I be?"
I'm Redman, bitch, do your fuck for free
She gave me a number then she park the truck
I walk to the club line long as fuck
I'm rocking on, to the break the dawn
And if you're smoking like me, blow your horns

[Chorus by Redman]
Pee,peep. home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks

WATCH OUT! Watch out! Yeah
Peep, peep, home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks

[Redman: verse 3]


We up in the club and my homies straped
BIGGIE small saw e'm playin' "where brooklyn at?"
Call the bartender over just to order a drink
RÃ©my & Cranberry, what the fuck you think?
The Dj's cutting' so I do the two-step
I wall  off the floor with the brand-new-chick
I'm rocking on, to the break a dawn
And if you're smoking like me, blow your horns

[Chorus by Redman]
Pee,peep. home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks

WATCH OUT! Watch out! Yeah
Peep, peep, home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks

[Redman: verse 4]

The Bricks in the house, and you know what it is
We don't think nothing less then doing it big
Hoodrats say "RedMan, I like your style"
The rims on my car be poking out
I walk to the hood, niggas, give me that
They say Reggie Noble hold it down and rap
I'm rocking on, to the break a dawn
And if you're smoking like me, blow your horns


[Chorus by Redman]
Pee,peep. home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks

WATCH OUT! Watch out! Yeah
Peep, peep, home girl pump ya' breaks
Peep, peep, ho-hohomegirl, pump ya' breaks
