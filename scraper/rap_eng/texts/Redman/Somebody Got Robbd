[Verse 1 - Redman]
The economy down, you ain't know?
Niggas is starving
Blacks can't set up shop
Boy I love my hood but my finger on the trigger
It be warning niggas saying keep your head up doc
I got robbed before, I could spot the tension
I could spot the car riding slow with tensin
His peripherals he sees a victim
My peripherals I see them slipping
Never catch me boy, plans gone wrong
The streets taught me how to post them bare arms
My shotgun pump I call Nia Long
They drill them like ary bonz nigga
But still the right stickup kid rob your whole fam
Shoot your knee cap until you get the program
Where the safe, where the drugs, where the gold, mane?
I can't make you but I bet the 44 can
Stop the blood clot cryin'
Gimme what I need take it easy and I ain't mad lyin'
My boys outside is waiting on a signal
And next rap niggas chains is on the menu
So when you hear these words:
"Give it up nigga"
It's a 80% chance that nigga gorilla
That he got your jewelry all on the floor

[Hook - Redman]
That nigga fucked, he just got robbed!
Now up in brick city somebody got robbed
And out in NY somebody got robbed
And right about now somebody getting robbed
That's why I keep a heater when it's cold outside
Out in Chi Town somebody got robbed
And out in Killa Cali somebody got robbed
And all around the world everybody getting robbed
Keep the gun under 'cause the bricks get wild

[Verse 2 - Redman]
I got a younger brother that did 12 joints
For robbery, attempted murder, and assault
So believe me boy when it comes to getting robbed
I got a team my niggas hungry for the job
Jersey niggas, don't sleep on the state
From Paterson to Camden, we increase the rate
Hey young bro, why don't you explain
How you rolled upon a nigga make them come out they chain

[Verse 3 - Mr. Yellow]
Grab a stolen car, load up slow
No mask on 'cause I'm thinking high mode
Let you see my face in the shine of the chrome
It's home invasion when I'm raiding y'all folks
Cock back the hammer and tell them what it is
Gimme all your fortune, everybody lives
I rob you at Mickey drive-thru for a dollar
I'm like Kang, nigga you tryina kick knowledge
I want dope, coke, money, jewels
I love this, shit I was born to be a goon
When it's a full moon Mr. Yellow gone change
Like take off my chain and put on your chain
(What you do?)
Fuck that chain, I sell it to another nigga
(Then what?)
Stack that bread then go stick another nigga
(Yo!)
That's why Mr. Yellow's on the job
And right about now somebody's getting robbed
