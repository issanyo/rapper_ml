I’m just trying to raise my kids right
I’m just trying to have something nice
I’m just trying to live life right
And keep my enemies out of sight
I’m just trying to take this up a notch
I’m just trying to take my family far from the block
Don’t want my kids to she the shit I saw when I grew up
So I’m out here on my grind trying to get my hustle up
Give them a good life have them living right
Don’t let them have to starve I sacrifice
So far from the thug life
And now I got to learn to love right
Cause man I ain’t perfect
3 kids 3 baby mamas but it’s working
And I’m still in alot of soul searching
Trying to be there for my kids cause they deserve it
Never thought I would be a single father
But it made me love my sons harder
I hope one day he gets his momma back
But like I tell him you can’t control that
But you can’t still make that hold you back
No excuses hell yea we going to make up for that
Trying to give up that fast life and
Getting better that that dead life
A nigga have a hustling name
Making sure my kids ain’t hustling man
Single father trying to get better
So I love y'all a love letter
Hope I raise myself to live right
Hope he grow up gopro and live life nice
I hope lil Dro B get the best too
I know coby smart enough to do what he want to do
Man this shit crazy
I might a hustle for my babies
Now I can’t be lazy
I got to get this paper for my babies
The world is yours future bright
You can be whatever you like
I’m here if you need advice
Now we can’t mess up twice
No father growing up so I had no directions
Still getting better daily learning lessons
Trying to get ya love God’s blessing
I’m just trying to get ya love God's blessing
