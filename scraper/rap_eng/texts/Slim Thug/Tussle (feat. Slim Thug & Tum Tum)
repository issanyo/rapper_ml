[Chorus]
I'ma do somethin' bad to ya, cuz you a motherfuckin' ho
If I see you at the club in the middle of the flo'
I'ma tussle, I'ma tussle
We gon' tussle, we gon' tussle
We gon' tussle better hope ya got ya niggas with ya

I'ma do somethin' bad to ya, cuz you a motherfuckin' ho
If I see you at the club in the middle of the flo'
I'ma tussle, I'ma tussle
We gon' tussle, we gon' tussle
We gon' tussle better hope ya got ya niggas with ya

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
I'mma do something bad to ya'
Disrespect ya', sit n' talk' trash to ya'
If you get outta line, I'mma bring it quick fast to ya'
Smash ya' head in the concrete
And H-Town stomp yo bitch ass to the beat
'Til I see that white meat for playin' games with my gang
My hoggs off the chain, they'll dance on ya' brain
In the middle of the club like "fuck it"
The laws see me and act like they ain't seen nothin'
Ya' niggas bluffin'
Talkin' hard actin' like you want beef
But when I see you in the streets, you hollerin' 'bout you want peace
1 to 100 G, I crush you and then bust ya'
Straight smash on you suckas, you punks don't wanna tussle
My nigga Tuck say we ready to ride
The whole south side Dallas waitin' on the South side
H-Town to the beat, we connected in the Tex
DSR and Boss Hogg don't want no flex

[Chorus]
I'ma do somethin' bad to ya, cuz you a motherfuckin' ho
If I see you at the club in the middle of the flo'
I'ma tussle, I'ma tussle
We gon' tussle, we gon' tussle
We gon' tussle better hope ya got ya niggas with ya

I'ma do somethin' bad to ya, cuz you a motherfuckin' ho
If I see you at the club in the middle of the flo'
I'ma tussle, I'ma tussle
We gon' tussle, we gon' tussle
We gon' tussle better hope ya got ya niggas with ya

[Verse 2: Tum Tum]
Motherfucker better clear a path, I feel the wrath
Cuz Tuck and Ro gon' burn ya scalp
Ho nigga tried to give me doubt
But I keep them snakes like a witches crown
It's about that time, respect my mind, I'm one of a kind
Been eyein' dime, fuck a dime
These jabs flyin' who threw 'em, mine
We gon' keep it crunk, pull out a pump knock out his fronts
Nigga my whole team drunk waitin' for the rest of ya crew goin' numb
I'm gon' drop a bitch, secuirty ain't stoppin' this
Real niggas get compliments, I'll drop a rhinoceros
See we all about pain, you niggas is lame, we head of the game
All my troopers are trained, we searchin' for chains, you hatin' on fame
Some of these ugly ass girls in here think they too fly to say what's up to a nigga
I want you to look at that ho an say
FUCK YOU (FUCK YOU)
FUCK YOU (FUCK YOU)
FUCK YOU (FUCK YOU)
FUCK YOU (FUCK YOU)
Now gut that bitch (GUT THAT BITCH)
GUT THAT BITCH (GUT THAT BITCH)
GUT THAT BITCH (GUT THAT BITCH)
GUT THAT BITCH (GUT THAT BITCH)

[Chorus]
I'ma do somethin' bad to ya, cuz you a motherfuckin' ho
If I see you at the club in the middle of the flo'
I'ma tussle, I'ma tussle
We gon' tussle, we gon' tussle
We gon' tussle better hope ya got ya niggas with ya

I'ma do somethin' bad to ya, cuz you a motherfuckin' ho
If I see you at the club in the middle of the flo'
I'ma tussle, I'ma tussle
We gon' tussle, we gon' tussle
We gon' tussle better hope ya got ya niggas with ya
