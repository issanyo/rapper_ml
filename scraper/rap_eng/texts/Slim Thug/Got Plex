[Slim Thug]
Welcome home, to the place where the haters and snakes roam
They smile in your face, but talk down when you gone
Don't get me wrong, my city got real playas and thugs
That act bad in clubs, and show nothing but love
But at the same time, a lot of niggas out to compete
And when they see they getting beat, they start having beef
For example, for those out there that don't know
I'm bout to wreck this lil' hoe, by the name of Lil' Yo
Can't forget Young Capo, J-Dog and Big Pic
You all some hoes, J.D. I can't forget about you bitch
All of the above, been hating on me
I know a lot of my fans been waiting on me, but they won't
Shut em down, show them haters who holding the ground
Fa sho, you know Slim Thug holding it down
Y'all just give me any chance, for shining in the rap game
It's like you committed suicide, when you hate on my name
Attention I bring, got you niggas flinching in pain
I might take it easy on you, if you plead insane
I'm changing the game, real ranges some thangs
Just like I gave you street fame, I'ma take your street fame
You can't claim North Star, if you ain't Slim Thug
Cause I'm the only nigga out of y'all, that's all the above
Fuck showing love, I got plex
I'm the one Big Ballin' Big Pic call next, uh
But as we speak, the Boss got the streets on lock
And with all this bad attention, I got the heat on cock
No more roaming a couple miles, I'ma dismantle your guys
When the Boss drop, your career gon stop that's no lie nigga

(fuck who you are nigga, Boss Hogg gon fade em all
Shit fin to get crucial dog, I'm telling y'all to strap up
Outlawz on the rise man, and a bunch of niggas gon die man
Hot cause we roll better mayn, when I'm out I'm getting paid) - 4x
