[Hook: Slim Thug]
If you gon’ be a boss, be a boss
If you gon’ be a king, be a king
If you gon’ be a bitch, stay a bitch
‘Cause there ain’t nothin’ in between
If you gon’ be a boss, be a boss
If you gon’ be a king, be a king
If you gon’ be a bitch, stay a bitch
‘Cause there ain’t nothin’ in between

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Fresh up outta dream, feeling like I’m Prince Akeem
Two queens makin’ sure my royal penis clean
Made my mind up, I only want the finer things
Went from the hood to living in the West Wing
Live like a king, thing like a boss
‘Cause if I want somethin’ I’ll work my ass off
‘Til I got it no stoppin’, no quittin’, givin’ up ain’t an option
Fuck waitin’, I got my own shit poppin’
Ain’t nobody gonna stop me from shoppin’
Ain’t nobody gonna stop me from ridin’ Rolls
And sliding in these young niggas fine hoes
Oh, but I’m cold with the game like The Mack
I jump back in the game, make a quick hundred racks
Tell her bring the money back but I’d rather make my own
I decided to be a boss and make a song

[Hook: Slim Thug]
If you gon’ be a boss, be a boss
If you gon’ be a king, be a king
If you gon’ be a bitch, stay a bitch
‘Cause there ain’t nothin’ in between
If you gon’ be a boss, be a boss
If you gon’ be a king, be a king
If you gon’ be a bitch, stay a bitch
‘Cause there ain’t nothin’ in between

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
King Krizzle, King Tut, it ain’t no difference
Chariot still whippin’ while gold still flickin’
Off the paint, yeah, the trunk, shaking like it know the stanky leg
I mix the struggle with the hustle to make bread
Ah mayne, I fit the family with a loaf
A piece off for my unborn to ball on these hoes
You got to save it, got ti pay it, double up and attack them haters
And ‘em racist motherfuckers, they try to take as soon as you make it
Multi and my brand that I own
A lot money tree, but what’s a tree if it ain’t growin’
In my backyard, my cul-de-sac large, I hold my nuts
I got the kind of ice on my grill that I can’t crush, plus my credit good
I spend the money from my sock, you wish your debt could
I wish a million for my partners, they still in the hood
They got skills but ain’t no court to ball
I ain’t talking shooting shots, I’m talkin’ shots to call
Krizzle

[Hook: Slim Thug]
If you gon’ be a boss, be a boss
If you gon’ be a king, be a king
If you gon’ be a bitch, stay a bitch
‘Cause there ain’t nothin’ in between
If you gon’ be a boss, be a boss
If you gon’ be a king, be a king
If you gon’ be a bitch, stay a bitch
‘Cause there ain’t nothin’ in between
