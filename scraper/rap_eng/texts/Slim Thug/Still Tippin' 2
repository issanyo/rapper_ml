[Slim Thug - Hook - 4x]
Still Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin' four hoes, and I'm packin' four fours (Hanh!)

Now look who creeping look who crawling still balling in the mix
It's that six six long dick slim nigga sticking your chick
Pullin tricks looking slick at all times when I'm flipping
Bar sipping car dipping grant wood grain gripping
Still tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin' four hoes and I'm packing four fours
Blowing on that indo GameCube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand me cuz I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big Glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big Boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm ridin' Sprewells sliding like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the nawf
Ain't shit changed I still represent (Still..), Hanh!

[Chamillionaire]
Ay Bigg Tyme
I'm tryna see the president dead (presidents dead?), that's what I said
But not the one in the white house man, the one with the green presidents head
Blue or red I'm still ridin', ladies be tellin' me that I'm sexist
And I guess it's, cuz I always love the money over dresses
Always been about them horizontal lines through them S's
That's a dollar sign, Impala flyin' watch how she undresses
Don't matter, if she black or white, dark or bright, she ain't actin' right
I'mma take that pretty braud out to eat, and then leave her there with a
Appetite
Niggas tell me they look up to me, and I know what y'all mean
Cuz I'm balling with tall green stacks taller then Yao Ming
All King, Koopa the Don, cruise with a gun
If being rich was a contest, Chamillion you would've won
I know, but watch the jealousy cuz ya still a get trampled
If you got whipped in the past then ya still a example
Treatin' niggas like Swishahouse flows, nigga what?
Soon as he start talkin' slow we gon' chop that boy up
