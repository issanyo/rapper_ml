[Hook]
Never ever trust anybody else but God
Life’s a bitch but if you hustle it won’t seem that hard
If you’s a lazy ass nigga then you ain't seeing no bread
Outside watching movie when your hustle is under the bed
But I hustle hustle
Every morning I hustle hustle
In the afternoon hustle hustle
Every evening I hustle hustle

[Verse 1]
I wake up thinking money and how I’m going to make it
And I got about a million ways for me to chase it
Love living large you boys cool being basic
I like exotic cars cribs and rolley faces
Flying to fly places bitches about races
Count big faces loyal be our faces
That’s what a nigga hustle for
I make a mil but I still keep hustling on
I like to show them stones watch them glow
Them jackers be watching but watch me drop them
With them four fours niggas thinking texas
Niggas thinking slow them boy in texas only think doe
Roley let them know

[Hook]
I never ever trust anybody else but God
Life’s a bitch but if you hustle it won’t seem that hard
If you’s a lazy ass nigga then you ain't seeing no bread
Outside watching movie when your hustle is under the bed
But I hustle hustle
Every morning I hustle hustle
In the afternoon hustle hustle
Every evening I hustle hustle

[Verse 2]
Uh it’s that feel real good shit
And it don’t matter if you from the ‘burbs or the hood shit
Wish a nigga would I’m from a wish a nigga would shit
So I hope cut and run in texas
You fuck around and get killed bitch
That nigga keep on saying yeah
Let me tell you why it’s a secret if you don’t know it
I got to tell you about it if you don’t know
Then it’s my pleasure to tell you how I keep the rest
On that down low cause if I tell I die
In real life how much more distinguished
Matching all the cigars being smoked
And tell how you get coke to perfection
I’ll settle for that I’ve been through so many
Crosses I deserve a medal for that
I ain’t a rapper king of the ghetto
Was a professor for that
When you press play in the classroom
As I lecture the facts
Like don’t hustle where you lay your head
That ain’t wise oh that’s your new friend
You trippin nigga cats ain’t spies

[Hook]
Never ever trust anybody else but God
Life’s a bitch but if you hustle it won’t seem that hard
If you’s a lazy ass nigga then you ain't seeing no bread
Outside watching movie when your hustle is under the bed
But I hustle hustle
Every morning I hustle hustle
In the afternoon hustle hustle
Every evening I hustle hustle
