Now I Gots Ta Work My Wood Grain Wheel
Trunks Steady Bumpin Grillz Steady Comin
I Takin Off Down The Runway Broad Day Sunday Haters Lookin At Me I Ain't Playin Nutin But Gunplay
Hand On The Grain While Im Swangin On The Oneway Boppas Everywhere I See Itll Be A Fun Day
I Might As Well Stay Up All Night Till Its Monday My Shit Will Prob End Up Where My Son Stay
Got Baby Momma Drama Cause The Bitch Drivin A Hyndai And I Got A Rolls G Up Hoes Still Down Till Im Down Watch Me Act A Damn Clown
Haterz Sit Around Makin Muthafuckas Frown Flippin Through My Town Tryin To See What The Fucks Up Boss City Ballas
Niggas Get Ur Bucks Up I Gotta King Ranch Thatll Make U Put Trunks Up
Looks Like Them Other Boys Ran All Their Luck Up
Damn Sho Can't Touch Us We Them True Bosses U Know How We Do It Fool We Holdin Up Flosses

[Chorus:]
Now I Gots Ta Work My Wood Grain Wheel
Trunks Steady Bumpin Grillz Steady Comin
Now I Gots Ta Work My Wood Grain Wheel Hand On The Steel Cause Them Haterz On My Heelz
Make Me A Mill And Done It Before The Deal
Dem Other Boys Lien Slim Thugga Speak The Real
Candy Paint Shinin 5th Wheel Reclinin Caddy Goin Topless Like Them Dancers At The Diamond
Boss Yea Blindin And Everybody Lookin And Where Im From Women Ain't The Only Ones Cookin
Boyz Gettin Paid Pushin Caddy Escalade Still Roll Vogs Used To Roll Blades
Braids In Tha Face When We Rep Tha North Side
And U Ain't Ridin Slabs If That Ain't Swangas On Ur Ride
Ready For Whatever If U Think Thug Is Scary Ill Unload The Glock If It Gets Necessary
Been Legendary In The Streets Of The H Cause I Stay Ridin 4s Putin Candy In Ur Face Mayne

[Chorus:]
Now I Gots Ta Work My Wood Grain Wheel
Trunks Steady Bumpin Grillz Steady Comin
This Drink Got Me Leanin I Ain't Smoked All Day So Im Fienin Im Feelin Like Im Livin And Im Livin Like Im Dreamin
My Candy Slab Gleamin I Pass With A Flash
Smashin The Gas Find Them Boyz On Glass
Swangin Bout To Crash Then I Look The Other Way
Make My Slab Sway Down Here Thats How We Play
Ridin Down Mlk Chuckin Dueces To That Trae (Where U At Trae)
Niggas On The Grind Mayne Boyz Is On The J
I Got Diamonds On My Colla Shoes Say Prada Shades Say The Same Ima Kill Them On It Mayne
While Im Workin On The Grain Ima Hog On The Road
I Make Em Move Around Like Them Laws On Rolls
Trunk Steady Hummin U Hear Me When Im Comin Beat Hittin Hard Soundin Like A Drummer Drummin
Everyday I Stay Stuntin Ain't Goin To Stop Till Im Dead On The North Side We Ride Blue Not The Red

[Chorus:]
Now I Gots Ta Work My Wood Grain Wheel
Trunks Steady Bumpin Grillz Steady Comin
