Slim Thug ft L.E.$ - Halloween Night

[Hook]
Dressed in all black... in my black ride...
I got my mask on-- it's Halloween Night...
Goons at the do'... trick or treat, nigga
Lay down- Lay down on the floor; trick or- trick or treat, nigga...
Dre-Dressed in all black, in my black ride...
Got my- Got my mask on-- it's Halloween Night
Goo-Goons at the do'.... trick or treat, nigga
Lay down- Lay down on the flo'-- trick or, trick or treat, nigga

[Slim Thug]

It's Halloween tonight.... that mean them jackers out
Ridin' by your house, tryna plot it out...
Been watchin' all week--
Timin' yo' every move--
Know when you pick them kids up and drop 'em off to school
Know when yo' old lady make it home and go to work
Even know what day you score and where you get your work...
They want it all and don't care who all they gotta hurt--
Cuz you been cappin' 'round town; that's how they saw ya first
Was in the club spendin' grands, you must be the man..
You was drunk and ain't peep 'em in your rearview stand..
Knew you was gone so they followed you all the way home
And now you're layin' face-down with 'K's at ya dome

Uh-huh...
Niggas out'chere ballin'... and we got ya starvin'...
Ski-mask and a pistol-whippin'-- that's the way to solve it..
.35-revolve' with me-- make 'em lay it down...
And into them gangs-- we don't play around...
Tatted up and the whip all-black--
Load that clip then you cock that strap--
Smack that bitch if the hoe react and I can't do jail; no time for that
We roll on a nigga for a Rollie... Choke niggas up out they chain...
Beat niggas up out they braces; bitch ass niggas gon' feel my pain
You see, they gainin' fat and I'm losin' weight so I'm eatin' off'a they dinner plate
Fuck Dollar Menu, I want a steak--
We eatin' good but they eatin' great..
I'm Michael Myers, I'm Freddy Krueger, I'm Jason, nigga, yo' nightmare
Them horror niggas at yo' door--
Don't hide, nigga, what? You scared?

[Slim Thug]

I got my mask on-- trick or treat
My pistol out; it's time to eat..
It's haunted out here in these streets--
Goons lurkin', tryna creep...
Tryna see if a nigga slippin:
Cappin' hard with no bodyguard..
Rappin' hard but the nigga fraud so when I see him I'ma pull his card
Scary nigga... talkin' tough....
I'm 'bout to wire yo' mouth up...
I'm 'bout to fire yo' house up...
Call the laws, i don't give a fuck
It's Halloween--
Niggas dyin'--
Mask on--
Shots flyin'--
You can hear mom and kids cryin'--
I'm takin' everything good I find;
Better brake yo'self, don't make yo'self--
End up on the Breakin' News
I'm breakin' fools and breakin' rules
Fuck payin' dues, I'm takin' dues...
Makin' fools, lay it down at first sight of this AK
This Halloween, fuck trick-or-treat...
You can have what I don't take....
