{chorus}
My bitch, been down when I wasn't shit
She keep it 100 dont switch
Cause thats my bitch
Gave me a safe place for the bricks
Even help me hit a few licks
Still my bitch
Gotta help a nigga get rich
Get popped she ain't never gone snitch
Yea thats my bitch
Go hard she ain't never gone quit naw
She as real as a bitch get
Cause thats my bitch

{verse 1}
I got a down bitch I can ride around with
From the hood I can smoke me a pound with
Keep it g she ain't with all that bullshit
Got her own money far from a groupie bitch
She a dime all around playas want to save her
They tell her Thugga ain't gonna love ya, fuckin haters
She still by my side she say she can't stand lames
She say her pussy ain't for sell, you can keep the change
As far as I can tell its a keeper man
Ain't tryna argue with ya baby let you do you
Got me trippin' like its too good to be true

{chorus}

{verse 2}
Been my number one fan before I got a deal
Got a job still keep me with a hot meal
Baddest bitch I ever met, you gotta see her
Fine as red wine & pretty as Aaliyah
All the hoes hatin' on her cause they wanna be her
Can tell I got love for her, they see how I treat her
She say she down to ride for me & I believe her
I'm gettin love shit I think I got a fever
Never thought I'd see the day when I fall in love
Got plenty bitches but she the only one I'm thinkin' of
Keep my blunt rolled, clothes ironed for the club
She a down ass bitch, forreal cuz

{chorus}

{verse 4}
I go to jail I dont even make it to the cell
I'm in process she already makin bell
Always on time shit it never fails
She right behind a nigga, cleanin' up my trail
Through all my day to day shit its hard to live without her
A nigga be lookin lost whenever I ain't got her
& them girls better watch what they say
Tryna start shit cause my bitch dont play
She'll scratch never running from a match
Bitch get to talkin reckless she'll put her on her back
On top of that she stay ready to get it
At any givin minute I can hit it
Cause thats my bitch
