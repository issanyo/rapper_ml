Let me work, let me work my wheel slow

Let me work, let me work my wheel slow

Let me work my, let me work my
Let me work, let me work my wheel slow
Tell me how it feel ho
Just chill ho
Let me work my, let me work my
Let me work, let me work my wheel slow
Tell me how it feel ho
Just chill ho

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Just chill, ho, be still, ho
I'm working wood real slow while my grill glow
She say she on the pill though
And I'm puffing kush by the pillows
Wrapped up with cigarillos
So hell yeah nigga still throwed
Rolled eighty-fours, fresh set of  vouges
When I'm on the road slap so cold
Drank poured, I'm a syrup-aholic
Watch the crib when the po is crawling
Was broke, but now I'm balling
Used to cap, but now they calling
She's ready to ride, ain't no stalling
Her and her friend, yeah they all in
She shotgun on my shotgun, I blast off and mash off
Took 'em to the pad on that note
Gave 'em something they can brag about
Thug boss, toe tag 'em out
Kill 'em, make 'em feel it
She say she tired of y'all fake niggas
She wanna ride with the realest

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Just chill, ho, let me work this wheel slow
I gotta crack my window cause of the indo
Got your mind on nympho
So let me beat your tempo with your mental
Pimp pimp primp roll
I get you stuck like limbo
Cause I'm Southern-playalistic super fly to keep it real
You don't know what you in for
So stop and roll up and pour up fours up, su-su-sucka
Shug a brother, gripping grain, hogging lanes
Diamonds pressed against my knuckles, bitch
I did it big, put on for my team
Don't be twisted now to pushing buttons, ho
Can't be cutting all this bass and your thoughts are scream
You gonna shake? Do it under these things
You gonna front? Get the fuck out my ride
This shit here ain't a one time thing
Be grateful that I let you slide
And not your friend, and not her partner
Cause she was a bopper and claim she twerk
But you was a top notch bitch and back
Why a pimp nigga had to chose you first?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sant]
I'm not to be fucked with, me and you ain't partners
You steady talking that fame shit, well this flow's one of a kind
I'm plotting on my next move while you resting quiet and slumber
See me I'm 'bout my commas, dollars cause Big Sant bitch on the come up
It's that motherfucking OG again
Let me tell you something about me again
By seeing wind and I'mma take the shot
I'll give her me, but she a V again
She take the cock, bird ass ho
Gonna run the block to ring a knock
A few drunken pops
