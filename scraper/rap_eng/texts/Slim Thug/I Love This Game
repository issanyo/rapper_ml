[Intro]
Ladies and gentleman
We’d like to welcome y’all to the show tonight
We are now in the Houston sold-out arena
Get ready to witness history in the making
On behalf of the whole game
And the fans of Houston
We’d like to introduce the boss of all bosses
Slim Thugga

[Verse 1]
As the wind hit my face while I drive through the lane
As you can see, I really love this game mane
I’ma baller, a shot calla
And I’ve been winnin’ in all four quarters
Listen to the crowds, you hear what they sayin’
They on they feet gettin’ krunk because they see me playin’
Kids say I’m the man, thugs love my style
I keep it street with the braids and the diamond smile
I’m the star of the team, I make the most —
I got five, but I’m working on my sixth ring
Across the states, it’s much love and fame
That’s why Slim Thug love this game

[Chorus]
All the fans, all the fortune, all the fame
I can’t lie, I really love this game (I really love this game)
There ain’t nowhere in the city that ain’t knowin’ my name (knowin’ my name)
I can’t deny, I really love this game (hey)
Ain’t nobody else gettin’ this change (gettin’ this change)
I can’t help but to love this game (but to love this game)
The fans show me love, I show ‘em love back
I’m an all-star, you gotta love that

[Verse 2]
I’m the big ticket, the new franchise
Check my stats, I ball harder than them other guys
I lead the league in numbers, we got the most wins
An’ every game we win, we up by at least ten
I’ma playa, at the same time I’m the coach
When there’s a problem, I’m the one the whole team approach
In the clutch, Slim Thug the go-to man
When it ain’t lookin’ right, then put it in my hand
I still ain’t fail ‘em yet, so they give me respect
The city love me and they prove it when they —
There ain’t nobody else getting this change
I can’t help but to love this game

[Chorus]
All the fans, all the fortune, all the fame
I can’t lie, I really love this game (I really love this game)
There ain’t nowhere in the city that ain’t knowin’ my name (knowin’ my name)
I can’t deny, I really love this game (hey)
Ain’t nobody else gettin’ this change (gettin’ this change)
I can’t help but to love this game
The fans show me love, I show ‘em love back
I’m an all-star, you gotta love that

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It’s playoff time, they watchin’ in the streets
We gon’ win, but I’m goin’ for the full sweep
And I ain’t gon’ lie, them other teams stepped their game up
But I’ll be — if I let that mess my name up
I’m playin’ focused man, and you know dis man
If you don’t know dis, sit back and watch me show dis man
The game in my hand, tonight’s the big night
I’m used to it, I’m ain’t nervous, I’m feelin’ bright
I’m a born winner, the number one contender
And I ain’t the only one who thinkin’ this when I enter
The crowd got my back, the fans love me mane
I show ‘em love back, you gotta love this game

[Chorus]
All the fans, all the fortune, all the fame
I can’t lie, I really love this game (really love this game)
There ain’t nowhere in the city that ain’t knowin’ my name (knowin’ my name)
I can’t deny, I really love this game (hey)
Ain’t nobody else gettin’ this change (gettin’ this change)
I can’t help but to love this game (but to love this game)
The fans show me love, I show ‘em love back
I’m an all-star, you gotta love that
