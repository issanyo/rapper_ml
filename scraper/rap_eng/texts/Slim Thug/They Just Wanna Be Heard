[Verse 1]
Two hits to the weed and the clutch clops
Henny up in me at the bus stop
Seen the cops hit the curves we will buss that
My lil nigga shooting guns he a thug now
We did lost a lot of real niggas so it’s blood clot
Sling that bitch like act if I got to
I ain’t pussy I’ll prove it to you one thing
When I see you I know I’m shooting point blank
They going to make them think twice if they try
Is there any way to think for somebody
I bought it you bought it I shoot it too
Where I’m from now there’s nothing to do

[Hook]
Don’t be on the blocks popping shots
God forgive them they just want to be heard
They just want to be heard
Thuggin on the block poppin shots
They ain’t crazy they just want to be heard
Gang bangers needs love too shit
They just want to be heard
Wanna be heard Chicago
They not crazy they just want to be heard
Somebody
Hey

[Verse 2]
Lord forgive these young hustlers or the drug dealers
Next time instead of being broke try seeing making a million
Pack a pistol but ain’t trying to do no killing
But these other niggas starving and they be like stealing
Can’t have no feeling in your DNA
Or cause you self everything come up lost
They feeling like the streets the only way out
Minimum wage ain’t shit when them new J’s out
They just trying to be heard
Pull a clean piece of chain roley sip a surrup
Ghetto dreams tired of chasing around
Trying to show up like a boss and put on for the team thug

[Hook]
Thuggin on a blocks popping shots
God forgive them they just want to be heard
They just want to be heard
Thuggin on the block poppin shots
They ain’t crazy they just want to be heard
Gang bangers needs love too shit
They just want to be heard
Wanna be heard Chicago
They not crazy they just want to be heard
Somebody need to be heard

[Verse 3]
Hey if you don’t tell them now
You don’t tell them notta word
You don’t tell them screw
They gonna self serve
Teenager when she touch the block
They ain’t paying her any attention so she fucked the block
She just like to be heard ain’t like the cost you lot
Call her a disease in the end cause she fucked alot
I could have told her hi but I told her bye
I told her I was coming back I told her a lie
So it’s clear he had something on his mind
I should have ask him what's wrong
Probably would have told me before he blasted his dong
Saw tighter paint everything red bitch semen
A dog have to roar but a nigga still eating
You gonna be heat

[Hook]
Don’t be on the blocks popping shots
God forgive them they just want to be heard
They just want to be heard
Thuggin on the block poppin shots
They ain’t crazy they just want to be heard
Gang bangers needs love too shit
They just want to be heard
Wanna be heard Chicago
They not crazy they just want to be heard
Somebody
Hey

Get a couple cups of cham
Niggas going to the ground
They just want to be heard
Get a couple cups of cham
Niggas going to the ground
They just want to be heard
Bad ass nigga
They just want to be heard
