[Jazze Pha] Chorus

Everybody loves a pimp
Chuurch. Tabernacle. Preach
Everybody love a pimp
Chuurch. Tabernacle. Preach
Everybody loves a pimp
The way I talk, the way I dress
I be so clean, I look so fresh
(Everybody loves a pimp)
The ice I wear, the car I drive
The hoes I got, they look so fly
(Everybody loves a pimp)
When ya pimp-ish, ya pimpin'
Everybody loves a pimp
When ya pimp-ish, ya pimpin'
Everybody loves a pimp

[Slim Thug] Verse 1

You know the boss got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but he got much more
From BK, N.Y. to the Malibu shore
I got a chick in every city, I can go on tour
You need a pimp in your life that's gon' guide you right
Won't handcuff ya when you tryna creep at night
I don't lose sleep at night [?], I don't care
I be hibernatin', call me Yogi the bear
I'm a pimp, baby
That's why I hold my nuts and walk with a limp, baby
I know you're tired of dealin' with all them simps, baby
So gon' hop on my team and drop your wimp, baby

[Slim Thug] Verse 2

Slim ain't with gettin' drama from chicks
So when my boo turn bitch that's my cue to switch
You won't catch me throwing licks 'cuz my feelings involved
I just erase 'em out the black book, problem solved
Bet she learn how to keep her mouth closed
I got zero toleration for hoes
Move to the next one, it's plenty fish in the sea
And plus there's plenty other chicks that dig me
I'm a pimp, baby
That's why I hold my nuts and walk with a limp, baby
I know you're tired of dealin' with all them simps, baby
So gon' hop on my team and drop your wimp, baby

[Jazze Pha] Bridge

I know you're surrounded by a lot of suckas
My advice is keep it pimpin'
All you see me with is G's and hustlas
Still a pimp. gon' keep some women
(Bitch where's my money?)
I see the game through the Cartier lens
Push a 'Lac 'stead of driving my Benz
Try to be a gentleman, as nice as I can
But bitches be playin'
