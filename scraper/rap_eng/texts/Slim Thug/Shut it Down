[Intro: Slim Thug]
Thugga...we still serving and collecting these niggas, mayne
Third time around, mayne
Still representin' this Texas shit

[Hook X4]
Bring the trill, trill
Bring the, bring the trill, trill, trill
Bring the trill, trill to yo hood and shut yo shit down (Boss Hoggs)


[Verse 1: Le$]
Now it's that bottom of that map
Home of that candy paint on them 'lacs
Ride wheels slow sitting low when the vogues on poke, fifth wheel layin' on back
Smoke my black, tip my hat
Still gonna tuck it, still gonna live it
Drop them screens, still ride clean
I ain't gonna lie playboy we did it
Y'all don't get it, this our lane
Still gonna swang, still gonna bang
Piece and chain still gone hang
Like my nuts on y'all mayne (Hold up)
Cigarillo full of that dro (Roll up)
Hit me when I move real slow (Po' up)
Came out hard coming down that 'vard
All I ever gotta do is show up
Know what, gripping steel as I grip the wheel
Bad yellow with me she on the pill
I keep it pimping she know the trill
I bust the nuts she knows the drill
I hit the scene bitch I'm a star
Hell yeah my rims mo' than the car
Still pullin' boppas and comin' down
The flyest nigga you'll ever find

[Hook X4]
Bring the trill, trill
Bring the, bring the trill, trill, trill
Bring the trill, trill to yo hood and shut yo shit down

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Come on, let's take a first-class flight back to the fortress (Why?)
To have cats, getting nauseous
Bad yellow chick trying to ask for a portrait
But not me, the car, yeah that's looking gorgeous (Woo)
Handle business yeah that's going corporate
Rep the H like that's an endorsement
Never forfeit I never passin' our torches
Where's competition probably back where the morgue is
Anyone that's not us get left where the corpse is
Cause you know I gotta kill it, you know I gotta get it
You know I move product cause they feel it
And Imma stay hotter than a skillet (Tryin not to spill it)
Sippin' out the cup til it's empty
Cars that we rollin' in never say rent me
Swagger like Pimp C
Bank account lengthy
(You don't like me, then you gotta come with me)
Hell nah I don't think so
Talk down but don't do it when we meet tho
You can talk down but don't do it then my peep and my boys'll be shootin' at your rims like a free throw
You tattered up let your ink show
And let me get you in the mode
I know you wanna get thowed, with the candy sittin' on vogues and your music's gotta be slow

[Hook X4]
Bring the trill, trill
Bring the, bring the trill, trill, trill
Bring the trill, trill to yo hood and shut yo shit down

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
Whole crowd go 'hol up,' when they see the man boss roll up
That's right niggas get your dough up
I show you boys out here how to show up
Leave a hater sick in his stomach make him throw up
Po up a fo'
Let's go sip
Blue long line coming down like crips
Free Lil Boosie and my nigga named Tip
Cop shotgun Imma take you on a trip
Come floss with the boss
Imma take you to that Nawf
Were slippers get got and slippers get gone
Nigga'll rob the nigga next door
Next day be like 'look what I bought'
Next let's gone head take it to the South
See boys riding with the candy red gloss
Bangin' Z-Ro "Know what I'm talking 'bout?"
Niggas always talkin' 'bout how we talk
Jackin' our slang see how we swang
Love them slabs coming down with the bang
You already know it's a Texas thang
Boys getting rich off that cocaine, mayne
Land of the thrill
Still popping purple seals
Still paying all my bills
Making mills without a deal, ha

[Hook X4]
Bring the trill, trill
Bring the, bring the trill, trill, trill
Bring the trill, trill to yo hood and shut yo shit down
