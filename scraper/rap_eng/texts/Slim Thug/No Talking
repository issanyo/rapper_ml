[Intro:]
GMB (echo)
Thugga
Huh
Boss life nigga
GMB (echo)

[Verse 1:]
I talk it like I walk it
Step inside my office
I don’t work with workers man
I only deal with bosses
Snitches got me cautious
Fo’five in my outfit
Can’t get caught in no crosses
I betta make my outlet
Work on deck
Tryna see my profit
Stacks going up
Like a motherfuckin rocket
I see it, i like it
I bet I cop it
Bank roll swoll
Can’t fit in my pocket
Louis duffel
In my hand
Full of nothing but [?] grand
Them niggas out here can’t stand me man
They talking down
But they really fans
Love the swag
Love the flow
Just mad I fucked and he loved the ho
I already know you wanna be me bro
Keep watching me like tv tho
Im in your face like 3D ho
1 stack, 2 stack, 3 stacks, fo’
All on the flow
And I still got more
Playin VHO and I’m still going pro
I’m out my mind
Yeah I’m on one
Don’t fuck with my
I’m the wrong one
See shit be all fun and games
Till them killas came with them chrome guns
Boss Hogg
Outlaws
Bitch we run the streets
Blue boys
Snoop toys
Fuck with we
It’s RIP
Catch me in that VIP
Poppin Rose with some freaks
Bet they all going let me be
Don’t believe me wait and see
SS parked outside
So I told them hoes let’s ride
Brought them back to the pad
And had them bitches acting bad

[Chorus:]
Talk talk it like I walk it
Only deal with bosses
Them snitches got me cautious
I, I ain’t taking no losses
Kush got me coughing
I sip that drink often
I do my dirt on the low
I, I don’t do no talking
Talk talk it like I walk it
Only deal with bosses
Them snitches got me cautious
I, I ain’t taking no losses
Kush got me coughing
Sip,sip that drink often
I do my dirt on the low
I don’t do no talking

[Verse 2:]
I stay pulling stunts
Just to piss these haters off
New black Ferarri
Insides tomato sauce
Go AP, plus I buy a hundred rags
I’ve been rocking gold
Way before I had the plaits
Tell them haters
[?] worry bout what i’m sellin
I’m going platinum in the [?]
Since ya’ll telling
Smellin like a pound
Yeah it’s going down
It’s Thugga in this bitch
Reppin for tha H-Town
Kush rolled up
We rolled up
Black Lambo with the doors up
I keep a fresh cup
Poured up
I keep a kush blunt rolled up
I’m an OG in this rap shit
But I still keep a young bad bitch
Who ass thick
Gotta have it
I’m an addict
For this paper
Gotta have it
And she’s just another band
Just another grand
I talk money
You wouldn’t understand
I’m hustlin’
Ya’ll niggas playing
Stuck to the plan
That’s why now bitch I’m the man

[Chorus]
