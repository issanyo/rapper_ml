[Verse 1:]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
Gone off patrone and this liquor got a player
Like me thinking, like me thinking
Why can't I keep my dick up out you girl
I wanna fuck you right now
Why can't I keep my dick up out you girl
I gotta fuck you right now
Cigars get sliced, cigars get sliced
Filling up with green now we smoking getting high
As a kite, as a kite
You got me feigning for that good girl
I wanna fuck you right now
I can't keep my hands up off you girl
I gotta fuck you right now
Drunk wit thug
I wanna fuck you

[Chorus 1:]
She woke up butt naked in my bed
I'm like how this shit happen, oh baby
Drunk wit thug
Ima beat the pussy all night
Last thing I remember was me and you grinding
Turning up in that club
Getting drunk wit thug

[Chorus 2:]
She let me beat the pussy all night (ay-ay-eh,ay-ay-eh)
I beat the pussy all night (ay-ay-eh,ay-ay-eh)
Beat the pussy all night

[Verse 2:]
And everything's all right
I had to bust like twice
Kept her legs shaking just like dice
I keep banging
Making sure she's hooked on my pipe
Cause once she let me hit it, she gone let me get it for life
I keep banging til the brain right
Ain't miss a drop, head game tight
Inside the sheets but I'm going deep
I'll make her weak til she fall asleep
I'm slanging, she sanging, on my mic til her voice hoarse
I told her she my Beyoncé
So hop up on this surfboard
Surfboard, surboard, swanging on that wood
Swanging, swanging on that wood
She swerving on that dick, swerving like a big body
Im hit curves in that shit, surfing all In that good good

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3:]
Thugga is the shit
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, took her back to my house
Told her to back up all that mouth
Hollering bout you the baddest down south
Beat that pussy on my couch
Talking bout she be repping that third
I wanna see all the shit I heard
Say her pussy better than syrup
Laid back on the bed while I get served
Uh, she drinking G like rosé, had to give her her corn dog
I slid the vickie secrets to the side
Ain't got no time to take draws off on site
Eat the pussy I might, this girls body so right
Got me on IG hittin like, I'm like Ike Turner Turner
Baby girl I don't play, now eat the dick Ana may
Said eat the dick Ana may
Bust twice, your head game so right
Ima keep you around for life
Pussy too good to just one night
She nice
I'm back in the morning
I need it again, keep going in, we going in
I beat the pussy all night(ay-ay-eh,ay-ay-eh,ay-ay-eh,ay-ay-eh)
I'm hella tired, hella tired
I've been sippin that's the only thing that's got me going live
Goin live
Looking like I'm leaning cause Im empty
You've been drinking all of my-watermelon
I want that pussy right by me baby girl, I want you right now
Can't keep my dick up out you baby girl
I want you

[Chorus 2]
