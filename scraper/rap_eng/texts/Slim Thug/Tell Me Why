[Intro: Rayface]
Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?

[Hook: Rayface]
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
Is it ‘cause I fucked her on GP?
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
Swear it’ll never break me
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
These niggas be fake on me
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
It won’t make me

[Verse 1: Rayface]
Swear I’m dealin’ with some shit I keep within
I’m thinkin’ out the box it’s like they blocked in
From a town where these bitches fuck your best friend
You should grind, and use your head as weapon
Get it from the bottom, go through every step
Can’t help a nigga who ain’t tryin’ to help himself
Niggas hating’ talking’ down for attention
Pussy nigga so I pay him no attention
Mix the good with the bad gotta sacrifice
How you gonna get some money nigga you ain’t livin’ right
Feel like I was born with this appetite
Chase the money, got it wrong before I got it right
Yeah, I take the money and the glory
Everybody know a nigga story
Gotta stand on what you believe in
Man I thank the lord just to be breathin’

[Hook: Rayface]
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
Is it ‘cause I fucked her on GP?
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
Swear it’ll never break me
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
These niggas be fake on me
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
It won’t make me


[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Why they hatin’ on me?
Is it ‘cause you waitin’ on me?
Want a G to hand you a bankroll
So you can fuck it off on these stank hoes
Or is it ‘cause I smashed one of your hoes?
Way before you hit long time ago
But man that shit outta my control
You need to go get up out ya feelings though
Or is it because you feel like I owe you?
In real life I bet I don’t know you
In real life I bet you don’t know me
But you always tellin’ stories
I swear this fake niggas act like bitches
Jealous when they see a nigga gettin’ riches
Realize my blessings won’t block yours
So I don’t know why the hell you hatin’ for

[Hook: Rayface]
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
Is it ‘cause I fucked her on GP?
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
Swear it’ll never break me
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
These niggas be fake on me
Tell me why they hatin’ on me?
It won’t make me
