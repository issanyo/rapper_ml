[Intro: Slim Thug]
Thugga
Sound like some Snoop shit
We making some Thug shit

[Verse: Slim Thug]
I'm one deep in that 'lac laid back, cruising
Came a long way from that north side of Houston
I'd never know one day I'd make it out of this trap
Or that I'd get rich off of making up a rap
Momma watching TV, brother cooking crack
Sister 14 and pregnant and that's facts
Of my life and shootouts at nite
But instead of being scared, I'm trying see the fight
We used to it cause everyday they do it
Momma thinking we dead, about to lose it
Always been a boss, never took orders
Good thing, unlike my other partners, I was smarter
When they was getting locked up, I'm grinding more harder
Half on the block, the other half on recorders
And who knew one day folks would use it
To ride and get high to, it's that cadillac music

[Hook: Devin The Dude]
It's the Cadillac music
And I hope that you can use it
If you don't have a Fleetwood
You can jam it in your Hooptie
Put it in and just ride, ride, ride
Put it in and just ride, ride, ride

[Verse: Devin The Dude]
Now this is the type of shit you have a slight lean when you ride to
Especially if you got some tight weed like I do
Cadillac creeping with the fresh brown leather
Old school simply cause the shit sound better
Seventies, just leave them be
You feeling the vibe - Ah Ah Stayin' Alive
Ohio player type shit, sugar pudding
Scooping up fine freaks fuck wuggah woofin
And I'm looking for a spot where I can chill and whatnot
When they ain't tripping on me smoking on the kill that I've got
And that's every club parking lot here that's jumping
I roll up, say hold up, bitch, stop bumping and get in
Take a spin with your boy in the Caddy
Guess I'm just a player, not a pimp, I'm not your daddy
Just a nigga that'll put some dick in ya
And I know that you can use it while you're listening to Cadillac music

[Hook: Devin The Dude]

[Verse: Dre Day]
Uh, uh, cheyeah
Why these laws keep harrassing?
They ain't got nothin better to do than put us blacks and
Ese's

[Hook: Devin The Dude X4]

...ride, ride, ride
