[Intro]

[Verse 1]
It's Slim Thugga muthafucka, got a lot to sell
But snitches already got a lot to tell
So far as y'all know all I do is just rap
And give these streets something they can play in they trap (cheyah)
Last year I had to put my city back on the map
This year we goin hit em right back with a slap (that's right)
I had the whole wide world tippin' on 4's (fo's)
Sippin' on drank, using gland slow
Claiming they the boss I guess they like my style
Copyin what I do, mayne they like my child
I'm listening like damn mayne them boys wild
Thinking to myself, mayne them boys foul
Bitin' everything from my slang to my smile (damn)
Thought I was goin let it slide... hell naw!
If the shoe fit wear it, listen to it compare it
You niggas ain't my fam, how my style you inherit

[Hook]
I call all shots, all wins no losses (no losses)
Follow me, I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses, I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses, I'm the boss of all bosses
Ha, fuck what'cha heard, fuck what they talking
They follow me I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses, I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses, I'm the boss of all bosses

[Verse 2]
Ha
H-Town, trendsetta I'mma lead the way
The only rapper doing everything I say
Them other boys fiction (ha), grew up bein Christians (ha)
I'm a good dude, I just gotta alot addictions (that's right)
I love getting money you can see it in my face
It's like I'm bout to bust when I stuff my safe (cheyah)
I love getting pussy but I hate these hoes (I hate these hoes)
I'm bout to hit the block and -drop the top on 4's-
I know you probably tired of hearing about my cars (I know)
That's what'cha get for turning hood niggas to stars (that's what'cha get)
What the fuck you would do if you was me?
Never had shit now you rich as you can be (what)
Used to hit lick's selling bricks in the streets (ha)
Now I'm selling hits for ten times the fee (ha ha)
And stayin' free, I ain't seein' no jails
The boss of the south gon stay giving them hell (ha)

[Hook]
I call all shots, all wins no losses (no losses)
Follow me, I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses, I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses, I'm the boss of all bosses
Ha, fuck what'cha heard, fuck what they talking
They follow me I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses, I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses, I'm the boss of all bosses
