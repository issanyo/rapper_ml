[Hook: Slim Thug]
Big Moe po'd up, keep that purple in my cup
Keep some purp rolled up, I'm slowed up, man hold up
I showed up on 4's and rolled out with ya hoes
When she see me pull up clean, she reach for them candy doors

[Verse 1: BeatKing]
Pockets full of paper
Glass shooting laser
Banger in my lap for them motherfucking haters
Club God with your bitch sittin' on some swangers
Trunk bangin', try to jack, bitch I'm aimin'
Ridin' through the Wood
Chrome lady on the hood
I'm chunking deuces out
Bitch my roof is out
Watts got me chopped
My drop got me bops
Pull up clean, no screens that's 98
I got my top back
I ain't got no worries
Hit the block with four 15's
Your grandma can't hear her stories
Cut my beat down when I see the lawsso they ignore me
Bitch it's H-Town like [?] and Robert Horry

[Verse 2: Lil Keke]
Yeah they know what I'm talm bout, yea they know what I'm sayin'
Big Moe in my foam cup, real nigga ain't playin'
Goin off that loud pack
Knock her down don't call back
Gettin' where y'all at
Don Ke still all that
Best believe them hoes reachin', runnin' up to this nice car
Stand up for a real nigga, girl you sho picked the right star
We smokin' that good shit
Still sellin' that white chick
Stay away from this H-Town, you ain't bout that life trick
Still knocking that BeatKing, grippin' wood when I roll up
Still reppin' that purp shit, hater nigga better hold up
Do it big for that Southside, stay clean on that cash route
We blowin' that big money, bitches know what I'm talkin' bout

[Hook: Slim Thug]

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
Big Moe po'd up, keep that purple in my cup
Keep some purp rolled up, I'm slowed up, man hold up
I showed up on 4's and rolled out with ya hoes
When she see me pull up clean, she reach for them candy doors
I got chosed you already know how that go
Don't let me borrow for the night, I give her right back
Super pokers on glass
You can tell I'm gettin' cash
Cause the paint splish-splash
From the [?], to the dash
White cup sippin', got a gangster still tippin'
Still woodgrain grippin' while the candy blue drippin'
Work shipping Down South and a million dollar house
RIP Big Moe, much love from Thug Boss

[Outro: BeatKing]
You already know I'm bout my dough
I'm swangin' 4's and I'm riding slowly
You already know my music slow
And you know it's in my cup that Big Moe
