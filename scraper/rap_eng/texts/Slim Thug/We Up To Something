VERSE 1
(O Fresh)
Nobody move, I’m ‘bout to come through – man I promise
Open the door, you know you can’t turn up without us
I ain’t scared to lose it, I hope you don’t mind me too honest
Cause honestly, I’m going way too hard, rollin’ way too deep, taking things too far
My crew on the loose, you’ll have to do something about us
I'm O Fresh – let me say salaam
I go James Hard-en, every time I’m on
Bar for bar, they might call me Haram
I rep' H-Town with Slim Thug, no complications
I keep my enemies close, it takes a lot of patience
Young Muslim, start the conversations, (aw yeah)

CHORUS
I thought I told you, girl, the clique outta' control
I just thought that this was something you should know
Me and the crew, I swear we do the most
We' bout to get it - get it - get it and go

(Slim Thug)
MAYN, I'm up to somethin'
(O Fresh)
I swear to God, we up to something
Clique is so outta control
Told 'em, they already know
Clique is so outta control
We' bout to get it and go

VERSE 2
(Slim Thug)
O Fresh, yeah we up to somethin'
H-Town, so the trunk is bumpin'
You gon' hear me before you see me comin'
Everyday, all day we stay stuntin'
Can't stop and we won't stop
Pulled up in that big drop
Old school caddi, no top
You know the Boss got the city locked
Throwin' the H up out the roof
Shinin' like Paul Wall's tooth
Got girls coming by the group
No cologne on, but I smell like Snoop
Hit the club, 'bout 40 plus
It's 30 girls, 'bout 10 of us
They stop and watch when them bottles bust
Boss Life, we can't be touched
Club lit when we show up
My whole section on po' up
Everybody in here know us, cause our flows is the throwed-est
Texas made and we Texas paid
Been reppin' hard since I had my braids
Paved the way for ya'll gettin' paid
Cause nowadays, I done got my raise
OG in this game
Never been no lame
All about my chains, life's good I can't complain
I'm in H-Town wit' O Fresh, complications
Coming live from my favorite city in the nation

CHORUS
I thought I told you, girl, the clique outta' control
I just thought that this was something you should know
Me and the crew, I swear we do the most
We' bout to get it - get it - get it and go

(Slim Thug)
MAYN, I'm up to somethin'
(O Fresh)
I swear to God, we up to something
Clique is so outta control
Told 'em, they already know
Clique is so outta control
We' bout to get it and go

VERSE 3
(O Fresh)
No time like the present time, runnin’ overtime, and I’m not stallin’
Squad lookin’ like an All Star line, ya’ll out here Lavar Ball-in
Fists up for black lives, I cosign
Yellin’ "Free Palestine" ‘til my throat dries
"ReFresh", about to go live
(No lie, man we so wild)
New stress, I don’t need that
Pressure on the rise, I’mma beat that
So cold with the flow when I go from the Burbs to the Trap
I could throw it in reverse 'n' bring the heat back
Damn! Did you see that?
I’m ballin’ everyday, like a League Pass
"Rookie of the Year" cookin’ up MVP stats
The Champ Is Here, now where ya seats at?
Put ya seats back
I’m about to blow up, check the heat map
I do it for the city, if we down 3-1
I put my Kyrie’s on and bring the whole team back
"We Up To Something", believe that
Go ahead, go tweet that
Then retweet that
Then repeat that
IG, Snapchat
Facebook that while I recap, (BOIII!)

CHORUS
I thought I told you, girl, the clique outta' control
I just thought that this was something you should know
Me and the crew, I swear we do the most
We' bout to get it - get it - get it and go

(Slim Thug)
MAYN, I'm up to somethin'
(O Fresh)
I swear to God, we up to something
Clique is so outta control
Told 'em, they already know
Clique is so outta control
We' bout to get it and go
