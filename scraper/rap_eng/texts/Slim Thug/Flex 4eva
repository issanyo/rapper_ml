Feat. Beat King, Boston George

These niggas don't like us
I don't like me walk in the club dog

All these bitches on my dick
I tell these hoes to keep calm
Keep calm
Tell these hoes to keep calm
These niggas looking salty
Cause they bitch up on my arm
On my arm
20 Benz up in my palm hold up
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)

We gonna flex 4eva
Stack them chick forever
It's level for this chick and I'm on another level
My chains cost a lot higher
My car's a lot more flier
You in the ball and still paying notes
I pay cash I'm a buyer
My bitches be a lot...
My pockets way more feather
That's why them boys be hating but I'm a millionaire don't matter
Yo bitch is my side bitch
All I buy is fly shit
Every season my rides switch
I barely even get to drive it
Cheerios I side your bones
Being J in my 'sace clothes
Cracking ace and deuces
I only fuck with no Gucci
I know the haters is sick of me
Just bought my fifth Bentley
Never going broke but all night
This bitch I live that boss life

All these bitches on my dick
I tell these hoes to keep calm
Keep calm
Tell these hoes to keep calm
These niggas looking salty
Cause they bitch up on my arm
On my arm
20 Benz up in my palm hold up
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)

Dope boy I've been what
Smoke Kush like I make love
She eating dick like she ate it
Slime can take some of this hate for me
Beat King got the club jumping
Real niggas we in this hope
Don't come around us bitch we ain't fucking
Turn the keys we burn and breathe
When it comes stunt it's a murder scene
Been in LA right by the door
The bitch get drunk it's time to go
Photo shoot on this fucking couch
Bad bitches like to pick'em up
Fuck for one then I kick them out
The next time they'll be sitting up
Don't do much I'm finessing
Don't talk much I'm impressing
She Xed me with that...
I told you bitch is my whip
My key with chain like a cooler
I hit the bitch the whole ruler
She's sucking dick like a hooka
I've been kidding shit
Nothing new to her

All these bitches on my dick
I tell these hoes to keep calm
Keep calm
Tell these hoes to keep calm
These niggas looking salty
Cause they bitch up on my arm
On my arm
20 Benz up in my palm hold up
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)
We gonna flex 4eva, we gonna flex 4eva (hold up)
