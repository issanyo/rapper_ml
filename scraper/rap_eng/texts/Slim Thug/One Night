[Kirko Bangz]
I got that money
I got them cars
I got them clothes
I got it all
But you should know that I'm a one night nigga
I'm a one night nigga
I'm a one night nigga , girl
I'll treat you good
I'm from the hood
I put it down
You know I would
But you should know that I'm a one night nigga
I'm a one night nigga, girl

[Slim Thug:]
If only for one night
Baby, let me change your life
Let me show you what
Livin' that boss life like
In this world of lames
Ain't too many real niggas
Fuck what you heard
Don't judge me
Till I get to chill with ya
Be real with you, take you places
You ain't never seen
The phantom [?] to get ya
That be gettin' green
Clean when we roll up
Quart a mill or better
I'll bet that leather
Will make that wet pussy wetter
Been right for the night
Got a taste for lobster
Take and Mr. [?]
But I can't be your man
Gotta get back on them checklist
Please understand
Gotta get it

[Hook]

[Slim Thug:]
See how mu hustle work
My freak time is spendin' mon
I'm still chasing dream even when I'm livin' none
Givin' 'em all I got
Climbing closer to the top
And you so bad
You give a nigga hustle blood
So let's enjoy the present
[?]
Till the day I land
Ain't tryna move too fast
Let's have a blast
Drink till we pass out
Party and fuck
Nobody gotta know about us but us
Can't let them haters in
Our business baby
They're tryna block a shine
Without commitment
You're gon' still be mine
Girl, I hold it down
When I'm around
We gon' live it up
I gotta go but I be back soon
Don't give it up too much

[Hook]

I'm a leave the studio
Turn my phone off
Come and pick you up
And I'm a give you all you need
For one night yeah

One night with you, girl
One night with you
Catch a flight with you
Touch the sky with you
I'll give it all to you tonight
So take some pictures
Let's make some memories
And send 'em to your sisters
One night, one night, one night
