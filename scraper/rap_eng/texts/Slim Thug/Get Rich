[Verse 1]
Damn it feel good to be a hustler
Everyday I stay shining on you suckas'
Addicted to chasing dreams, live like kings
I'm a boss you can tell by my pinky rings
Tell my old hoes I don't want em' back
I'm on some new shit they don't like that
Tell all my haters that they still loss
They still ain't shit, and I'm still a boss
Been that before Rick Ross
Been thuggin' before Thugga' Thugga' came out
No hate though, I hope we out stay rich
It's enough of everybody tryna' hit licks
It's enough of everybody tryna' get rich
So stay away from the snake shit
Keep it 1000 with the [?]
Just know you do dirt that you gon' get

[Hook]
It's enough of everybody tryna' get rich
What you gon' give out you gon' get
If ya'll don't know by now karma a bitch!
[?] how you get rich

[Verse 2]
Good business go a long way
You can use it whenever you have a bad day
If you good foot niggas like [?] okay
But if you a fuckboy move out the way
Same way in this world but they call it creative
It's easy to fuck up but so hard to gain it
Niggas ready to rob instead of grinding
Catching bullets in they head doing timing
Take your time young'un fore' [?]
Looking lost thinking it's cool to be a crook
Til' they ass on Ferguson and picking cotton
Make you a new slave until you turn rotten
It's enough of everybody tryna' get rich
So stay away from the snake shit
Keep it 1000 with the 1's [?]
Just know you do dirt that you gon' get

[Hook]
It's enough of everybody tryna' get rich
What you gon' give out you gon' get
If ya'll don't know by now karma a bitch!
