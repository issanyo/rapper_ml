[Intro]
Thug, feeling good in a bitch man
Thug show me
You know what I'm saying?
If you ain't feeling me you need to get on my level man
You know what I'm saying?
We in this bitch getting higher than a mind fucker, yeah
Say I'm up in this mother fucker
Kush lit, drank poured
Know what I'm talking about?

[Verse 1]
The kush lit, the drank poured
Thug boss in this bitch, 'bout to get dough
From the city where we like to live life slow
Relax man, what you in a hurry for?
Bust down the swisher (swisher)
Break down the kush (kush)
Roll it up
Tight and light it
Puff then push
Inhale, till you feel it fill up your lungs
Exhale slow, through your nose on your gum
Sit back and be patient till you feel numb
Eye's get low, waiting for your buzz to come
Man enjoy yourself, repeat them steps, proceed
We said you'd get high off the Cali weed, hold up

[Chorus]
Now as the world turns, cool as ever
I'ma ride as the world burns
Ain't nobody tripping
Kushing and living lay
Check my bank account
Money I already made, money I already made
Cruising on the highway, all I know is the flyway
So I'm dropping off from the top, dropping off from the top
And shouting "she gon' rogue"

[Verse 2]
Hit the corner store and pick up a spray
Styrofoam cups and ice, we gon' lean tonight
Now pop the seal, make sure it's real
No needle holes in the bottom
Man we know the deal
Chill, pour out the soda
Pour in the purple
Put the cap back on, shake it up in slow circles, we good
Now pass your cup, let a nigga pour you up
This shit muddy man, you 'bout to be fucked up
Sip slow, take your time, never drink fast
I know it tastes good, but you gotta make it last
Now relax, mix that with your Kush sack
You gon' be leaning back, feeling high to the max, hold up

[Chorus]
Now as the world turns, cool as ever
I'ma ride as the world burns
Ain't nobody tripping
Kushing and living lay
Check my bank account
Money I already made, money I already made
Cruising on the highway, all I know is the flyway
So I'm dropping off from the top, dropping off from the top
And shouting "she gon' rogue"
Hey
