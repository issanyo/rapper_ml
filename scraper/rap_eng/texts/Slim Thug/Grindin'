[Verse 1:]
I’ve been grindin my whole life
Nigga, know what I’m talkin bout
For d shit I used to do I should be doin life
Nigga, know what I’m talkin bout
Mix my purple wit my Sprite, nigga, know what I’m talkin bout
Smokin dat kush got me out like a light
Nigga, know what I’m talkin bout
Lookin for a bad bitch dat’s sex esteed
Know what I’m talkin bout
It’s hard to find a bad bitch I ain’t already hit
Know what I’m talkin bout
Hit d galleria blew about ten stacks
Know what I’m talkin bout
Next day hit a lick an get it right back
Know what I’m talkin bout
Might catch me in dat fifth gettin fucked up
Know what I’m talkin bout
If you see me in dat gatsby say “what’s up?”
Know what I’m talkin bout
Fifteen year later guess who still trip
Know what I’m talkin bout
When they start acting fake guess who still real
Know what I’m talkin bout
I’m straight, you niggas is fake, you niggas is snakes
I’m at d crib, it’s out by d lake, make no mistake
My life is great, I’m in good shape, might take yo mate
We up in  Houstons, we eatin steaks, we eatin steaks
I’m gettin money, eatin good, sleepin good
Came a long way, from d days in d hood, but I’m still hood
In dat drop pier wid dat chopper, don’t got room for too many partnaz
Boys be lookin like dey wanna try me
Ima have dem boys lookin like who shot you
Don’t play no games or mess wid lanes
If you ain’t bout yo change don’t say my name
Thugga still in d A shinin mayne
Cause Thugga still in d H grindin mayne

[Chorus:]
I been hoggin all my life nigga, know what I’m talkin bout[x2]
Knockin dese hoes you callin yo wife nigga
Know what I’m talkin bout
Certified G wid all a ma stripes, nigga
Know what I’m talkin bout

[Verse 2:]
I been playin wit d ross since I took it up d freeway
Send a nigga shit way before I seen a Ebay
In d hand wid it like a nigga in a relay
You ain’t get d message pay attention to d relay
Put it on ma mama an ma old man TJ, believe me
Playin wit dem suckaz like a DJ
Bitch I been d man since d day I left d PJ, nigga!
Know what I’m talkin bout
Pocket full a bread like a whopper at a BK
Fake ass rapper, don’t believe d shit dat he say
EA sports a nigga really in d game
He just comin, takin shke an it’s spittin me jay
I just met d brawd down the road name Phillipe
Cop a hunid back an bring it back just like a replay
Drop it in d bowl Ima microwave slay
I’m a risk turner chicks I’m on d grind like TK
Get in nigga, it’s d planet a d apes
Get banana clip I put a hunid on yo brain
Sell a couple books run an fuck it off quick
Walk beside judge an spend a hunid on a chain
Know what I’m talkin bout
Take a nigga bitch
Want yo own lady better put her up quick
Best of both worlds, grayed hair good dick
Do it like a book make a nigga hoe split
Know what I’m talkin bout
I’m d man, I’m d man
Say d shit again, God dammit I’m d man
MVP God dammit I’m d reign, nigga!
Know what I’m talkin bout
Get rich quick mean money on demand
Me being broke that is never in the plan
You ain’t talkin money nigga I don’t understand
Ha! What you talkin bout?
I do dis shit for fat pad, hyper rockin davies
Niggas ridin slayer but dey coulda bought Mercedes
Some old school got made in d 80’s
Big wheels pokin got dem lookin at me crazy
Halfway sleep, codeine got me lazy
Swingin left to right when a nigga come down
Got him dirty dancin like I dropped Patrick Swayze
Nigga, know what I’m talkin bout

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Hey!
