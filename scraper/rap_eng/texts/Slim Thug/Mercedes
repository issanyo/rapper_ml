[Verse 1]
Catch me riding top down through the city
Only one deep, only missing you with me
I need a boss lady to put up in my Mercedes
Book smart but bad enough to have the babies
Independent, educated, got degrees but still
Cool enough to come kick it with the G's
Got her shit together, parents raised her right
Not about that THOT life, she was raised to wife
Not the type to one-night, she'll keep ya
She off the scene, all the ballers ain't never seen her
Track record low, body count with squares
In due time, we might just end up a pair

[Chorus]
Wanna ride in my Mercedes?
You gon' have to show me
You gon' have to show me
You gon' have to show me
Wanna ride in my Mercedes?
You gon' have to show me
Oh, you gon' have to show me, show me

[Verse 2]
Baby girl you fine like wine
I'm just tryin' to see you shine
Let's share some good times
I'm just trying to make you mine
I just wanna take you coast hopping
Let's take the boat option when it's cold
Take you coat shopping
I know they watching
But I know what I'm down for
As long as you keep it 100, it's fuck 'em all
Let's keep living, keep giving them haters something to talk about
'cause while we all around the world, they at the house

[Chorus]
Wanna ride in my Mercedes?
You gon' have to show me
You gon' have to show me
You gon' have to show me
Wanna ride in my Mercedes?
You gon' have to show me
Oh, you gon' have to show me, show me

[Verse 3]
Boss lady for a boss, ain't into going out
She in the house
Got her own dreams that she chasing
I promise she's so amazing
Southern Girl, look good, cook good in the kitchen
To be the best wife is her mission
Ain't no competition
One of a kind, so I can't leave her behind
Had to make her mine
It's going down
