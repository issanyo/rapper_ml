[Intor]
Aight, hold up, Thugga

[Verse1]
I’m a let this world know what’s going on
I only speak truth when I touch the microphone
I be at the crib living like a king on a throne
And the big big balling like a boss King Kong
And I never hate, never take breaks
I’ve had bad bitches in every six state
I’m focus, so focused I can’t wait
Can’t wait, falling off, I’m getting this cake
I go by the name of Mr. Slim Thugger
Ask about me they’ll tell you he a hustler
Never been fake no I’ve never been a sucker
My bitch so bad I had to snatch off the rug
I had to do a thing
I ain’t tripping
A nigga still wrecking
In the state in the city if you looking for that action
Keep a ‘45 for the niggas that’s jacking
Ain’t looking for no trouble
I’m just ready if it happens

[Hook]
Came from the bottom nowadays a nigga living
Used to take away nowadays a nigga giving
Gotta be dumb if you can’t see my vision
I’m just tryna keep some real nigas outta prison
Came from the bottom nowadays a nigga living
Used to take away nowadays I be giving
Gotta be dumb if you can’t see my vision
I’m just tryna keep some real nigas outta prison

[Verse2]
Tired of seeing my niggas locked up
Throw some rocks every time the block got bust
And fuck the police i know they love to watch us
Lost a few but they still can’t stop us
But i’m like damn, was it worth it
When you free getting money life’s perfect
Yeah my niga Dre 10 he don’t deserve it
Trying to get shot life he don’t deserve it
Niggas still falling for the trap
There’s many ways out the hood, not just rap
Plenty ways to get paid like playing ball
Educate yourself, think big, never small
Big man, fuck tryna ball in the mall
Put your paper up till your stacks get tall
And quit tryna run before you crawl
Freedom is priceless, I promise ya’ll

[Hook]
