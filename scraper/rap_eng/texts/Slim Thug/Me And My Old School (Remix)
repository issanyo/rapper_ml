Ride, ride, ride clean
If you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I remember way back in the day
All I wanted was a candy car with hella flakes
Crushing hoes, slamming doors while the chassis shake
From the sub, work the juice, bitch I want the bass
Can't be turning on a dime cause the rims scrape
Kill switches for them jackers outchea tryna take
That's my prized possession in recession kept me straight
Clear my mind then recline on the runway, from Monday to Sunday
Just me and my old school

[Hook]
Ride, ride, ride clean
If you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

[Verse 2: LiL KeKe]
I got the old school right on these toes and slamming doors
Talking wood grain, mink on the floors and riding vogues
Chopping low, tip by slow, that’s how it go
Still a Texas boy sitting on foes and wrecking hoes
The seats so sandy fine, all cash
Fresh candy homie, branded wine - hold it down
H-town known to flip - feeling hood, looking good
With them boys out to sip, just let it dip
Convertible, the burgundy red get’s peeled off
I’m on glass when I’m showing my ass for dirty south
Don key still OG - just like the smoke fool
Riding 3 deep, me and KRIT - plus the old school

[Hook]
Ride, ride, ride clean
If you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
I used to roll in my old school, listenin’ to slow grooves
Head leaning back, had me feeling like a mac
7 mills dark black, I used to think I was goldie
"I see you shining Boss Hogg", that’s what my OG’s told me
And my old school so cool, roll like a new school
Escalade motor got it riding like a soldier
Late nights blowing dojer, reminiscing bout the past
And how now I got everything I wish I used to could have
I'm finally clean in my old school

[Hook]
Ride, ride, ride clean
If you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

[Outro]
See it ain't just a car, it ain't just a whip
It's a time machine, it's a spaceship, it's precious
You gotta take your time, you can't be rubbing on them curbs
And hitting them potholes
You gotta ride clean and ride slow
Me and my old school

[Hook]
Ride, ride, ride clean
If you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors
