[Chorus]
I'm still climbing to the top nigga
I'm still buying new watches nigga
You can talk down all you want
But i'ma keep doing what you don't, man

[Verse 1]
I'm from the bottom of the bottom
Trying to climb to the top
I'm trying to be the best like Biggie and Pac
I'm trying to be the best then drop in the club
And sell 10 mill like 50 did, 'cause
Rap game change so it look like I'm hopeless
If I stay high as fuck, how the fuck I'm gonna focus
Refuse to go back broke and live with them roaches
So everyday I'm calling plays, fucking with coaches
My game ferocious, I refuse to lose
I'ma stay up on my feet
Long as I got shoes
Me and my kids gonna eat, long as I got tools
I'ma make it in this game or I'ma make it on the news thugga

[Chorus]
I'm still climbing to the top nigga
I'm still buying new watches nigga
You can talk down all you want
But I'ma keep doing what you don't, now
I'm still pulling up the laps, nigga
I'm still buying new drops, nigga
You can talk down all you want
But I'ma keep doing what you don't, you'll see

[Verse 2]
Without a doubt, why not, take a little show money
And buy a couple bricks
Make a little blow money
Just to make up for me getting this slow money
Got popped on nuts, ended up with no money
Damn, Yeezy made that shit sound easy
Now I'm scared that this bitch might snitch
The game greasy but yeah
I guess that's what I get for being greedy
Had to pay for her cake, all them people was coming to see me
I remember the good old days when niggas didn't snitch
Them good old days when there was 16 to brick
Nowadays in the dope game it's hard to get rich
You gotta bust 'em down, put 'em together and shit

[Chorus]
I'm still climbing to the top nigga
I'm still buying new watches nigga
You can talk down all you want
But I'ma keep doing what you don't, now
I'm still pulling up the laps, nigga
I'm still buying new drops, nigga
You can talk down all you want
But I'ma keep doing what you don't, you'll see

[Verse 3]
Spirit of a guru
Apprentice of a Nazi
20 Rolex watches like I'm Liberace
Lot of niggas started with us
But they turned against us
Fuck niggas hear you talking even when you whisper
Can't be fucking with no nigga paperwork in court
We gon' find out everything before you go report
Street ho, cheat ho, legend as appealing
Bitch gon' fuck me in Detroit and don't miss out on blessings
Versace probably watching Biggie can you hear me?
I'm probably laughing, caught his spirit in me
Watching niggas copy, they so wishy washy
Say they did it but the city can't forget about it

[Chorus]
I'm still climbing to the top nigga
I'm still buying new watches nigga
You can talk down all you want
But I'ma keep doing what you don't, now
I'm still pulling up the laps, nigga
I'm still buying new drops, nigga
You can talk down all you want
But I'ma keep doing what you don't, you'll see
