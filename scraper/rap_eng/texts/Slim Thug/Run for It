[Chorus]
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Them niggas trying to come, we got them guns
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Them niggas trying to come, we got them guns

[Verse 1]
Just met 37 youngsters calling me OG
So I guess I gotta show what my OG showed me
It's good to stay lowkey, keep people out yo' business
The same ones talking tough will be the ones turning witness
This might sound lame, but ain't no future in the game
I could lie to you, tell you try it, you end up the same
Lost in the chain game until your family forget about you
When you come home, something gone, they looking at you awkward
Like how long this grown fella gonna stay at my house?
Eat up all my food, waking me up late, I'm kicking you out
Then it's back to the streets, favorite line "I gotta eat"
Youngster random, off the block, you're back locked the next week
That's the track on repeat

[Chorus]
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Them niggas trying to come, we got them guns
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Them niggas trying to come, we got them guns

[Verse 2]
See I been in them shoes, took ills on this block
I would have been the definition of a saint if I ain't stop
Ran from those same damn cops til I got tired and stopped
Started thinking bigger than my hood and look what I got
You wanna be on top? You gotta make boss moves
Heart, dedication and patience when you step in them shoes
You either win or lose, but ain't nobody to blame
You gon' see a lot of sweat and pain protecting your name
'cause these haters is active and they disguised as your friends
You gonna see a lot of pussies on some grown ass men
A bunch of Caitlyn's
Yeah, stay hating from the sideline
Instead of being on they grind they stay talking grind

[Chorus]
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Them niggas trying to come, we got them guns
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run
Them niggas trying to come, we got them guns
Run for it, run for it, run
