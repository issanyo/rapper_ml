[Hook - Slim Thug & (LaToya Luckett)]
Nigga we hustlers, we please our customers
Pay me or I'm a bust ya! this is my life!
In the hood we funnel, dough by the bundle
I make a fucking ton folk! this is my life niggas!
Bentleys to Hummers, winters to summers
Ya can't take it from us! wit all my ho's saying!
(Here without ya babe, I never wanna live without ya babe!)
I'm a G! We riding! - we riding! - we riding! - we riding!
Let's get to it G! We riding! - we riding! - we riding! - we riding!
Let's get to it G!

[Verse - Slim Thug]
Let's get to it G, I grind hard if anybody time do it's me
I'm from the hood mayne, where niggas good slang
And they'll take ya head off for a lil change (yeah!)
Was lower class (yeah!) broke no cash (yeah!)
Had to get up off my ass and make this time pass
Wasn't fast, but it eventually came, I'm a G in the game
Street rich niggas, born to get figgas
If you ain't starting on no team you fucking wit us
Everything you niggas done I done done it twice
Me and my Hoggz nothing nice, this is my life!

[Hook]

[Verse - Slim Thug]
Where ya Bentley? Where ya rose?
Where ya diamondz nigga? where ya ho's?
Ya probably make a lil cash out shows
But I spend that type of cash on ho's
We big bosses, in big houses
This ain't no ordinary cars, we big flossas
I made it legal now, fuck them people now!
Me and my thugs don't budge when them people round
I hold shit down, got the key to the town
Young Slim Thugga, I'm the realest around
Everything you niggas done, I done done it twice
Me and my Hoggz nothing nice, this is my life!

[Hook]

[Verse - Slim Thug]
I had to get rich, or either sit bitch
Fuck rolling shotgun I had to get my own shit!
And they respect me now, I'm Tha Boss of the town
Slim Thug getting love when he floss around
And I can be found on the same block
That got one of my brothers locked and the other one shot
But I ain't pushing no rocks or running from cops
I'm just chilling wit my niggas posted up on a drop
Naw! Ain't shit changed, just switched games
My bank account ain't the same, but I'm still the same
Everything you niggas done, I done done it twice
Me and my Hoggz nothing nice, this is my life!
