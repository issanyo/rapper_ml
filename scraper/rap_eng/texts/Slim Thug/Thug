[Intro]
He was once a thug from around the way
Slim Thugga motherfucker

[Refrain]
Thug from a
Thug from a Thug
Thug from a
Thug from a, Thug
I'm a Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from around the way
She say she wanna
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
I'm a Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
She looking for a Thug from around the way

[Verse 1]
I represent the H and the bottom of the map
And I was born and raised in the bottom of the trap
The number one rule is you gotta stay straped
Cause any given minute you can take that long nap
I roll with guerillas, dealers and the killers
Cause when I'm on stage that's the only fool feel us
Real Trill niggas, let me see your hands
But I do this for the streets
I ain't try'na make you dance
Roll solo I don't need no friends
Still flip that 'Lac
I don't need no Benz
And Harlem throwing money
I don't need those ends
Matter fact I be back
I need more to spend
She say she wanna

[Refrain]
Thug from a
Thug from a Thug
Thug from a
Thug from a, Thug
I'm a Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from around the way
She say she wanna
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
I'm a Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
She looking for a Thug from around the way

[Verse 2]
It's white-tee, Nikes when I hit the club
They say I can't get in cause I'm dressed like a thug
Fuck the dress code, we boutta hundred deep
And they gonna let us in or get they ass beat
Boss Hogg Outlaws roll like the mob
Everybody paid cause we stays on our job
Drop Bent', G-T
A blessing from the Lord
So haters don't be mad at me blame it on God
I'm coming out hard, them other boys soft
So I'm a hold it down for that H and the Nawf
Brand new jewelry look what I bought
Still running from the feds
I ain't never getting caught
She say she wanna

[Refrain]
Thug from a
Thug from a Thug
Thug from a
Thug from a, Thug
I'm a Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from around the way
She say she wanna
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
I'm a Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
She looking for a Thug from around the way

[Verse 3]
You say your man ain't fucking you right
You lonely and depressed need a Thug in your life
Well come on over here
I can feed your appetite
Take you back to the crib and beat it all night
She say she love Thug cause Thugga beat it good
Her man pay them bills but Thugga keep it hood
And I ain't gotta say it that's already understood
I take you for a ride, you can slide on my wood
I pick her up and shake her up and down like dice
Sweet like cake make me wanna take a slice
I ain't try'na take advantage but take my advice
Take a break from the fakes, get a Thug in your life
She say she wanna

[Refrain]
Thug from a
Thug from a Thug
Thug from a
Thug from a, Thug
I'm a Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from around the way
She say she wanna
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
I'm a Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
She looking for a Thug from around the way
