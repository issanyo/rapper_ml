[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Thugga!
Hold up, I'm just doing me man
I've been doing this for 15 years man
Minding my business, getting to the money
Changed a lot but still got the choppas nigga
Got a lot to lose, I ain’t playing with you
Have you and your whole clique laying with you
Them jackers get jealous when you get richer
Roll strapped, keep my heat like the laws
I got to keep mines just incase y’all have y’alls
Big boss never bow down stand tall
And if you don’t like me, fuck y’all
I don’t kiss ass or fake with you
Female ass niggas want to date with you
So emotional, I don’t share that trait with you
That’s why the boss can’t get cake with you
Stand alone, yeah I hold my own
Still keep it 100, in every song
My old haters fell off, I got new haters
Guess it’s cause I’m still getting new paper
Make them suffer when they see me shine
No deals, still staking more than niggas sign
They mad I left them behind
But I ain’t your babysitter nigga stop crying
I’ll be damned if I stop trying
I do it for the fam, can't let them down
That why every year I shut them down
About to make another mil, one more time
Boss Life nigga!

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Vandross nigga
Drinking lime in this bitch right now nigga
That's right, uhh
I’m like a curfew, come through and bitch niggas go in
He say he the truth, he’s going to have to show me then
If I’m too cool for you, then act like you don’t know me then
Fuck the world more then, that’s what Z-Ro be in
Bad bitches only, we don’t fuck with common hoes
Trying to knock them all down like some dominos
Vic and Anthony my niggas, never dominos
Chunking the deuces to bitch niggas, I got to go
Support me, you my people not a fan, man
I always held my ground, I never ran, man
And never put my shit on niggas when the man came
“I ain’t got your money, you’re looking for Lil’ Sam, man!”
Shit. Ain’t hard being real, hell, it’s even free!
I wish everybody was real; it’s how we need to be
You can live a long time, and die of old age
But you’re dead cause what you said on your Twitter page
Maybe you’re dead cause you trust the wrong nigga, man
Thought he was his man until his real man showed up
Didn’t see it coming, he poring drank in his soda
Should of paid attention, would have caught it in his shoulder
My nigga, don’t make me let the judge go off
Let it go hard, never let the judge go soft
And not just you either, I’ma judge your house
Lights out for all y’all, unplugging the whole house
Yeah, a Styrofoam cup inside a Styrofoam cup
That’s a $360 Styrofoam cup
Bottle with my name, I ain’t got to hide my Styrofoam cup
Y’all want to smoke? Tip the man and lit them hoes up
Real is real. Fake is fake
Haters trying to reel me in, I ain’t got take the bait
I know I ain’t on time, I’m in to make you wait
You’re fucking right, before I eat I still say my Grace
That’s what’s wrong with these niggas
They forgot the Almighty
Instead of “thank you Lord,” they be more like “all buy me”
Shit, and then they wonder they fucked up
Behind my back he raw but in my face he fucked up
I’m tired of showing love to all these Shirley ass niggas
Three Stooges ass, Larry, Moe, and Curly ass niggas
If I don’t fuck with you, then I just don’t fuck with you
You mad, make me take your ass in the morning nigga you trash
Real is real. And fake is fake
“Why they keep hating on you, man?” They want to take my place
Didn’t even see me like the Popo, they can make my place
The King and The Boss eating, ain’t going to save a plate, uhh
