[Verse:]
Gon’ rick on d beat, it’s d boy Thugga comin live from d streets
Heat on ma side got d chrome AK
Run up hater an ima let dat hose spray
Think it’s bout May here, yea it’s gettin hot
Might as well pull out some’n an drop d top
Could it be d rose or could it be a old school
It don’t matter cause this summer ima
Bitches be actin like dey got a attitude
Cause you see me comin down an I’m ridin rude
Trunk up, loud music going
Slim Thugga in dis bitch hell yea I’m flowin
Glowin like a diamond every time I step out
Still comin down hold ma red pot
What you talkin bout mayne, can’t fall off
It’s dat boy Thugga comin live from dat fucka now
Xplosive, hell yea I know it
Gettin higher dan bitch wid a flow chick
Hell yea nigga stay fly, keep a bad bitch wid me I don’t know why-hey!
Gotta get to d money mayne
An dem niggas talkin dumb mayne lookin like some dummies mayne
Cause I’m winnin, still in the ninth inning
Rappin like I’m still in d beginnin
Hold up, it’s dat Thugga, neva fallin off
Been a damn boss, still rap for d swish an haus
Like I said I’m tippin on four fours, still gettin money an shinin up on dem hoes
Yea, ride clean in some’n foreign, still steppin out wid d Ralph Lauren
Roun d whole world I’m touring, through wit yo bitch cause yo bitch boring
Had bestowed me a damn star, it’s d boy Thugga Slim Thug and I’m flippin far
Ridin in d planes, I’ll across d lanes
I ain’t trippin mayne I’m still slangin kane
Old school, act a damn fool, yes d boy rule comin down keep d tool on ma hip
Slippers get got, an if you run up, a slipper get shot
Cause bitch I ain’t slippin, candy paint drippin
Fuck wit me an ima give yo ass a whippin
Still tippin, on fours, watch d diamonds blow
Ima show d smile an let d diamonds glow
All in yo face, haters talkin down
It’s yo boy Thugga comin through poppin trunks around
Like I said in 9-9 mayne, I be still killin boys an dem nyats grippin grain
It’s d grant, slam back bad bitch
I ain’t even gon’ trip, Thugga got rich
But I’m still Thugga to d heart
An if them otha niggas talk down you know d punks don’t bark
On d otha side of d world
Run from me, boys nowadays actin like girls
I don’t understand it mayne
But I be in d black candid mayne
Yea, fuckin wit Slim, but Slim still ain’t fuckin wit dem
Mayne fuck em, row so low, yea I do dis shit down low
I ain’t got time fo’ you frauds,hey man I swear to God
Still hard still real to d fuckin heart
Like I been dat way from the fuckin start
An I been dat
Where d fight at, ima win dat
I keep it real, they just pretendin
In d drop top back, it’s a sunny day, sun shinin
So you know I’m shinin like a diamond
Drop head silver hood, hell yea bitch, I’m livin good
Pullin up to d mini mansion, an I just gave d backyard expansion
Hold up, Thugga
