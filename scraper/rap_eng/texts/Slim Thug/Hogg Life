[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
I wake up in the morning
Still high from last night
Ain't got no time to chill I got's to get my cash right
New rollie and my diamonds look like flashlights
It's more than you can do when they ask me what's the price
I'm coming down I'm banging screw
In that rari doing donuts still swanging too
Gotta step up, but my pockets got fatter
Born and raised in Houston, Texas so it's syrup in my blatter
The girls say they miss me
Them thugs say I made history
Them hustlers show me love I just don't get along with scrubs (Fuck em)
Club gods pushing tryna give me that kushin'
Your bitch'll get took'en, pull her while you ain't looking

[Hook: Slim Thug]
I want all the money, all the hoes
If your bitch  get chosed then she gotta go
I live a hogg life appetite for more, live a hogg life appetite for more
Give my all the cars, diamonds and gold
If your bitch  get chosed then she gotta go
I live a hogg life appetite for more, live a hogg life appetite for more

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
It's a hell of a night
I live a hell of a life
I do what the fuck I want, whether it's wrong or right
Stay high as a kite
Get drunk as a skunk
Me and my hoggs ball hard like it's first of the month
Keep that purp in the blunt
Bad bitch in my bed
You can have this world homie if you get you some bread
In the club like it's school never tardy for parties
Rose bottles in our hands and we drank them like 40s
[?] looking foreign all from overseas
Can't park it by my clique unless it's hundred g's
Paid the cost to be the boss ain't no more hidden fees
I live a hogg life baby and do it with ease
