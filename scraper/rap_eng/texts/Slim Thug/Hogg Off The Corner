[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Off that corner off that [?]
I done made alotta bank
So we sold drank
Bought gallons by the pint
Being on my cash count paper by the trashbag
Way before a hashtag I was takin' pictures
Up in Mekka Mekka celebratin' with my niggas
Sneak told me I can make it I wish he could see me now
Cause this shit we doin' now
Is the shit they see on TV now
Still hold my city down, ain't never fell off
Streets tell me when they see 'man we proud you out that North'
Like a boss paid the cost and everything was paid off
Tryna motivate them thugs so they can take them same routes
Keep on stackin', keep on stackin' 'til your cash hit the ceiling
You still a virgin 'til you fucking with millions

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda
