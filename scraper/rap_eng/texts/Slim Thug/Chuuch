[Intro: Joel Osteen]
I wanna talk to you today about the right people
Who you spend your time with will have a great impact on what kind of life you live
There are people God has already ordained to come across our path to helps fulfill our destiny
People that inspire us, challenge us, make us better
The right people have already been lined up
But here's the key: If you're spending time with the wrong people, you'll never meet the right ones
If you're hanging around people that are not going any place, people that are dragging you down, cause you to compromise, draining your energy, then you're going to get stuck
You can't hang out with chickens and expect to soar with eagles
You're going to become like the people you continually associate with
You wanna know what you're gonna be like in 5 years? Look at your friends
If your friends are going places, have a spirit of excellence, kind, generous, courteous, then those qualities are going to rub off on you

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Gotta get these blessings
So tired of stressing
Learning new lessons
Planning questions
It's time for testing
Never ever resting
I'mma stay grinding
So I stay shining like a diamond
I'mma stay climbing to the next level
And do time and
Trying to line up with them bosses
Trying to soar high with them eagles
Can't chill with none of you chickens
I'm tray get rich with my people
Too high to see you haters
Too blessed to play y'all mind
I ain't got nothing to be mad at
I'm drop head top down
Thank you, God, all the time for helping me live my dreams
And for exposing all of those who wasn't right for my team
I'mma keep receiving this games
If it's for the better, I'll change
Only live once, better do it right
I'm trying to leave a legacy, man

[Interlude 1: Joel Osteen]
Complainers find other complainers
That's the saying - birds of a feather flock together
My challenge is simple, make sure you're flocking to the right group
Victorious people associate with other victorious people
Winners hang out with winners
Happy people around other happy people
Eagles soar with other eagles
We don't like change
We want it to be just like it was when we were hanging out, growing up together
But it's a new day
You have children, you have parents to take care of
You have more responsibility

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
It's a new day
I got kids to feed
Plus, I got needs, understand that, please
Before you try to blame me
By being greedy, I'm just trying to be all I can be
You should've stayed down instead of knocking game
Now you're on the sideline watching me
Feeling like I'm where you're supposed to be
Man, cause you ain't see what I see
I put God first and went and got it
See, I came in the game focused
You was playing games in the projects
Got tired of being at the bottom
Trying to take my family to the top
Only wanna work with them winners
And keep raising up my stock
You still posted on the same block
Trying to move work out the same spot
Treating jail like it's in and out
And every time you get out, you got your hand out
I don't know what your new plan, but
But it ain't working if you're still hurting
No more excuses, no more complaining
Just praying hard with hard working

[Interlude 2: Joel Osteen]
But just because somebody is related to you, doesn't mean they're connected to you
They may have your blood, but they don't have your spirit
They may not have heard the call God put on your life
This doesn't make them a bad person
It just means God has a different assignment for them
Maybe they're at a different level in their growth, but they're not right for you in this season
This is one of the hardest things we have to deal with
Letting go of people that are not supposed to be in our lives

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
Can't let you slow me down
Can't let you slow me down
Can't let you hold me down
Can't let you hold me down
If you ain't trying to get better
Better move around
If you ain't helping, you hurting
I'm trying to chase that crown
I pray for success
I pray you're blessed
I pray for your best
But all the stress that you brought in my life
I lost all respect
We family, so it's all good
I ain't tripping, I'll still speak
But the trust has been broken
I [?] working with me
Being by myself, I'm at peace
I'm too old to be out on these streets
I gotta take care of my kids
I ain't got time to have beef
I just got time to do me
And see what's next out there for me to see
Ain't trying to block my blessings
So I listen to God when he speaks

[Interlude 3: Joel Osteen]
Bottom line, don't hold on to what God is asking you to walk away from
Another thought, you shouldn't spend a lot of time with people that are always negative, people that are constantly discouraged, you gotta keep them cheered up, keep them fixed
Now, I'm all for helping people, I'm all for being a blessing
Sometimes we have to love people back into wholeness
But if you're always giving and never receiving, that's an unhealthy relationship
You need to gradually make a change
