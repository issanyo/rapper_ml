[2Phace talking]
Hello, shit chillin mayne
Shit nothin mayne
Yea mayne I'm a hit that naked mayne
Go check out some of these gurls, knah I'm sayin
Watch e'm shake that thing, and break that thing

[Hook - 2Phace]
Shake somethin, until you break somethin
Bounce that booty off in the club and you can make somethin
Money and power, screamin dollar by the hour
Girl you lookin good and you know that you gotta...

[Verse 1 - 2Phace]
I got this thing for yella bones rockin the thongs wrong
Or a peanut butter complected chong with nothin on
Chocolate runnin bones shakin to a slow song
Hips and curves work ya nerves, pimpin thighs in the zone
Lickin her tongue at me cause her tongue ring catchy
A fool with the tools due to keep a playa happy
Like Oooooh jelly role on swoll make them boys act a fool
A sneaky lil' freaky deeky but keep it on the cool
When she groove the girl, groove smooth
Make them boys pay dues to catch the table dance blues
She hit the maker maker, from mo to money maker
Then hit scores later and watch e'm drop off the paper
Lady playa-clientel got her livin like a mayor
Peepin game like sports scouts no love for naan playa
You peep her in the streets you want peep her the same
But then you peep her in the club she a freaky lil thing, Uhhhhh

[Hook - 2Phace Repeat 2X]
Shake somethin, until you break somethin
Bounce that booty off in the club and you can make somethin
Money and power, screamin dollar by the hour
Girl you lookin good and you know that you gotta...

[Verse 2 - Slim Thug]
Uhhhh, Shake somethin like you tryna break somethin
When Slim Thug hit the do', they hit the flo' and try to make somethin
All hoes got all eyes on me
Cause I'm the baller at the bar buying up Don P
Off T-O-P I tell a girl how it be
If you comin with me you gon' be comin for free
I see the yella bone stars, hoppin out block cars
At the club top knotch lookin up the bar
Tryna find a big baller that pay like the way
That wanna sponser her clothes and her new place to stay
Good girl by day but she's a freak by night
That'll do whatever you say if you pay that price
Ain't nothin nice, workin they thing for they change
Make a nigga wanna stain and bang up they brains
See they cold slidin up and down that pole
I'll pull a X out of control I wanna run in that hole [Huuuuhhh]

[Hook - 2Phace Repeat 2X]
Shake somethin, until you break somethin
Bounce that booty off in the club and you can make somethin
Money and power, screamin dollar by the hour
Girl you lookin good and you know that you gotta...

[Verse 3 - 2Phace]
I'm own a world wide tour ghetto etrepenuar
Find the baddest lil mami that's gettin rich and put it to her
Cause hoes in the club show love
Takin that paper from a scrub and gettin it beat up by a thug
She in the club with them happy like she out on the block
Blowin good expensive pot when the X hit the spot
Clientel from ATL, Miami, and Spain
Got boys spendin they change like they buyin some good 'Cane
Gotta candy g string[string], lovin givin brain[brain]
Glow in the dark tongue ring that make you wanna sing
Oooooh my Lord damn this girl a fool
But you know I'm such a playa so I can't lose my cool
Minasatwi in a 50 foot car with a bar and a spa
Work it like a porn star we in a cash cruel world
This paper so demandin, kiss it with ya lucious girl you so outstandin'

[Hook - 2Phace Repeat 2X]
Shake somethin, until you break somethin
Bounce that booty off in the club and you can make somethin
Money and power, screamin dollar by the hour
Girl you lookin good and you know that you gotta...

[Break down - 2Phace 2X]
