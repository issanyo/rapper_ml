I'm from Trapart, Texas, where everybody selling. Snitches keep telling, now everybody felons. Feds is watching, them jackals is plotting. I gotta stay strapped, they don't leave me no options. From down in H town where they got the best prices. Bitches wanna ride cause our rides be the nicest. First and fifteenth you can find me hitting blocks. Hit my line one time, I'm on my grind round the clock
They hollering, "Dope man please can I have another hit." I cashed out fire plug, from me ten bricks. They hollering, "Dope man please can I have another hit." Trap house jumping on the first and fifteenth
Much love for Texas, I just bought a Lexus. That's one hundred fifty K, I blew it on a necklace. Young nigga, I'm reckless. Pussy nigga be flexing. I pull up side the head, give the pussy the exit. I don't talk on the phone, nigga I only do texts. You might be new to the game, you talking yay in the message. Behold be next, the nigga the law. Baking soda, whip it bitch, I watch the shit boil

From a G to a key I'm all about money. I put in work for this work, ain't nothing for free. HVD on my trail for the shit that I'm selling. But fuck the police what my hoe keep yelling. Bailing down the block in the cocaine drop. You can tell business good at my cocaine shop. Try to run up on the spot, I got an automatic cage. Pop, pop, pop, put that pussy in his grave
