[Verse:]
Still here 15 summers
I been ballin since d baby hummers
You wanna talk to me talk numbers
I ain’t tryna see you, Stevie Wonder
I’m just tryna pay ma child support, mayne
And still have some leftover baller change
See I came a long way from rippin wood grain
An rap about ma new lil piece of change
Nowadays I be pullin up like a boss
Cars still cost more than a house
Used to steal cars livin on an off
Now everything I drive is paid off
I be hoppin out d Ghost with 2 trophies
Walkin in d crib got em carrying groceries
Bitch I’m d boss, you can’t coach me
Betta get yo weight up befo’ you come approach me
Thugga! (thugga, thugga)
Hey! (hey, hey)
Look (look)
See what I’m sayin mayne, now we got trophies (got trophies)
Yea they didn’t think we got trophies (got trophies)
Hey!(hey, hey, hey)
I been rockin rollies since the small faces
I been had d grill when you had braces
I’m shakin out snakes avoidin all cases
Tryna make anotha mill still paper chasin
You can stay broke if you want to
But I’m addicted to gettin me some’n new
That’s why you see me ridin clean like I do
Fresh kicks, fresh fit, new bitch too
You only get one life betta ball nigga
Fuck settlin for less, I want it all nigga
I’m too tall to do anything small nigga
That’s why my AKA boss hog nigga
I done seen it all done it all twice
I feel like I’m goin on ma third life
If you real you should take this advice
Grind hard till you get yo paper right
Live a boss life nigga (nigga)
