[Verse 1]
God first, hard work, that's the key to success
If you alive and free, to me you're blessed
No drama no stress only way you around me
I feel like I'm too cool to end up back in that county
Found my way out the game, now my family straight
Cause they know they ain't never seeing me in that place
Can't wait til' [?] get home, we gon' still stunt hard
Can't wait til' King Dre get free, we gon' look like the mobb
[?] just touched down, the feds done took out my friends
[?] Wasn't tryna hurt nobody was tryna make a few ends
There came our end, I don't believe in the game
If the police don't get to somebody speaking your name
Tryna be home with the fam', see my kids grow up
I'm too old for new cases to start showing up
If you could slang caine' you can slang anything
And since you can be who you wanna be, imma' be a king
No more chasing fiends, I'm chasing my dreams
Stop thinking small, I want everything
Still stuntin' new Bent with the screens
Why not though? I'm a king, I'm a king

[Chorus]
No more chasing fiends, I'm chasing my dreams
Stop thinking small, I want everything
Still stuntin' new Bent with the screens
Why not though? I'm a king, I'm a king
No more penny hustling, in and out of jail
No more living like a slave in the cell
I'm a hustler there's plenty ways to make this mil'
And imma' figure it out, and ain't gon' fail, I'm a king

[Verse 2]
Fuck what anybody say about me
Imma make them eat their words, watch me
God got me, can't nobody stop me
You see me winnin', why not cop me?
I ain't perfect but I'm getting better
Everyday I wake up I keep getting better
Learning something new, getting more cheddar
I'm in that gym tryna' get it together
Making sure as I get older I get colder
And if you hating that, I ain't trying to know ya'
Cause kings only kick it with kings
And if you ain't thinking like that, you ain't on my team
Cause I'm a king

[Chorus]
No more chasing fiends, I'm chasing my dreams
Stop thinking small, I want everything
Still stuntin' new Bent with the screens
Why not though? I'm a king, I'm a king
No more penny hustling, in and out of jail
No more living like a slave in the cell
I'm a hustler there's plenty ways to make this mil'
And imma' figure it out, and ain't gon' fail, I'm a king

Came from the bottom to the top
Only difference with us, is you stopped
Ain't no shortcuts just hard work
And always make sure you keep God first (Amen)
Tougher your times, the bigger your blessings
Live right, when you make mistakes learn your lessons
Cause ain't nothing funny about being a dummy
Make sure you get your mind right if you want this money
It's hard to get this paper, even harder to keep it
You gotta educate yourself that's the real secret
And once you start living your dreams, why be anything else when you can be a king?
I'm a king

[Chorus]
No more chasing fiends, I'm chasing my dreams
Stop thinking small, I want everything
Still stuntin' new Bent with the screens
Why not though? I'm a king, I'm a king
No more penny hustling, in and out of jail
No more living like a slave in the cell
I'm a hustler there's plenty ways to make this mil'
And imma' figure it out, and ain't gon' fail, I'm a king
