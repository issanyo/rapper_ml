[Chorus:]
No flex zone [x2]
They know betta [x2]
No flex zone [x2]
They know betta [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Went and grabbed my weight up, OG in the tix
And errytime you see me at least 50 on my neck
Still drop that check, about to cop that vet
Havin a midlife crisis, all I wanna do is buy nice shit
Keep 4 5 fly chicks, you likin' all 'em pigs throw IG
They at the crib in the hot tub, try new tricks on me
I know they sick of me, mayne, me and my niggas made history, mayne
Came out the hood and went got that check
And they still alone, ain't feel love yet
No flex zone, my set done grown, my paper grown, six acres - home
I'm so betta, play so weller
Ima grind fo' eva, Ima shine fo' eva
One stop now, Ima get this money
My kids straight, daddy bringin em hunids
Ima gold getter, Ima gold getter
Never fallin off, Ima shine fo' eva

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I'm gettin' mo' cheddar, and I won't let 'em
Grillaz know betta, I put that on whateva
I fuck a lot windy, they say I'm so special
But niggas don't feel me, can we trust these hoes? Neva
Yung par with his D-flex only fuck boys don't mind see the door
Seen a hunid in the summer love befo' the song was drummin'
So this money kinda over, deep diamonds is new
Made so many millions, same niggas then when I was in the struggle
When I needed niggas, shine wid em too
Made a brand from the flow, CEO with the show
Understand fuck I live like Simon with Dro, nigga
Disappear the roof, I just tell the truth
Y'all ? line, hommie where the proof?
But I'm like Kermit, dude, and peace is none of mind
Me and my nigga Thugga rock the game we sittin' on the flow
So close when it's car time, eye you
Listen to the coach and it just be gone
Feelin' like a rich D-Shawn
Hottest nigga out where I'm from
How I rolled out the slums
Niggas told hunnid round draws
Only option get it, pucka get it done
Propane that nigga, how long you a nigga at?
Pull me up same key do ya thang
Cause the real niggas let it see
And a real nigga came up when you see pay yung niggas come hate
Look
Big body steppin' on percus
Kool-Aid shinin' on the surface
Gettin' paid ova these verses
Dunner so butt, said it came with the curtain
Most of my partners been layin in churches
Van carried out where the dirt is
Yes, ain't gotta green card
But I bet they know where that work is
I got a bunch of bad hoes that wanna jump in bed
Rubber bands stretchin' on loafs of bread
Money in my pockets, keep bumpin' heads
We don't burn out, we pump trucks instead
Now my bad muthafucka betta ask somebody
If they need it first I'ma attack somebody
You don't want nuttin' but to pass right by me
Whole business came knockin' I could pass somebody
That ass that came with me, I'm back with the squad
If you ain't go hustle, go back to yo job
A-Town be the city, that's where I belong
Been in these corners and ridin' with hoes
Prayin one day I might undo my wrongs
Savin' up hunids and wanna do ones
Breathing that kush that get stuck in my lungs
If they ask you my name betta not tell 'em none
