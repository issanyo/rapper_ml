Slim Thug:
Say Bitch, I know you see us
All these mothafuckin' diamonds, all this candy around ya -
You can't help but see us
Hah!

:
I'm pullin' out clean (clean)
You already know (know)
I'm leanin' off the drank and I'm smellin' like the dro (that's right)
Stacks in my pocket and my shine on glow
You better recognize a playa when he step through the door. (through the door!)

Chris Ward:
Yeah yeah
Open ya eyes and recognize a playa when you see one
Instead of always hatin' on one, try to be one!
Couja clothes, J's on my toes
Fruit Loop necklace with iced-out rows
My wrist so froze
Everybody knows when I step through the doors
Hand-cuff ya hoes!
I'm so fresh you could smell ya boy through a stuffy nose
They call me Chris Wizard, that's just how it goes

What? Step on the scene (what?)
You know I'm lookin' tight (lookin' tight)
Sippin' drank so you know I got a purple Sprite (purple Sprite)
Pocket full of cash (fo sho!)
Neck full of ice (shinin')
I'm in my zone so I'm tryin' to find somethin' nice (what?)
Badge on my neck, (badge)
I'm talkin' big rocks (rocks)
V-12 valet'd in the parkin' lot
Gettin' my shine on (what?)
That's what playas do
PJ the rap hustla, he done came through

I'm pullin' out clean (clean)

I'm pullin' out clean
Heavy hitters team
Cleaner's tag on my jeans
And a pocket full of green
We the dream team for the state of that Tex
Leavin stains of the bar when we break in the 6
You already know when we crawl down slow
Wrist lit up and a big chain on my throat
Candy paint coat got my frame drippin'
And I'ma move packs similar like a chain shipment

Slim Thug:
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm slidin' on the glass
Got butter on my ass
Just got my license back, still tryin'a do the dash
Everything paid cash
No notes, no leases
You broke ass niggas payin' notes on Visas
4's poke spokes creepin' on a block near you
Watchin boppers jock, lookin' in my rear view
20/20 vision, see haters in clear view
That's why I'm chunkin' deuces
I ain't goin near you!

Chris Ward:
Yeah yeah!
I'm back again like you owe me some cash flow
Most wanted, but most feared, like Fidel Castro
My pocket's over weight, so they call me fatso
Others call me bright lights 'cus the way that my badge glow

What? Back though, feelin' fine, flowin' on some killer pine, (killa)
Puttin' boys in they place when they see that blue line (what?)
On my game, havin' things, hoggin' in that turnin' lane (uh!)
Chicks hoppin' in the ride, hydro burnin', mayne. (what?)

Sir Daily:
You know that's it, cuz
S-I-R-ah
And outside Houtson, Texas boys on the borrow
I ain't even trippin'
I'm on that dro, too
24s on my low, comin' candy blue

Slim Thug:
You know the Boss talk G shit daily
Want somethin' free? No. Fuck you, pay me!
Pockets so fat lil niggas can't out-weigh me
Y'all small, Slim ballin' like (Mc)Grady

Slim Thug:
Yeah. So that's how it is mayne, ya know what I'm sayin'?
You can see the Boys in Blue in a hood near you, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ridin' in with something with no mothafuckin' top
Hundred-thousand around the neck
Hundred-thousand around the wrist
Hundred-thousand on the mothafuckin' pinky ring...
'Cus we mothafuckin' bosses
Gettin' this mothafuckin' money!
Yeah!
