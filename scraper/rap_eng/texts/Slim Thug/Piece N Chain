H-Town, Texas ain't nobody did it better
Trendsetter made the whole world copy
My own boss can't nobody stop me
When I pull up big rolls on 4's at yo hoes
You soft behind the pussy  and she told you exposed
I'm a pimp like young Sweet Jones
Like smoking swishers while your bitch give me dome
Still rode chrome through the streets of Acres Homes
And I'ma be a real nigga, til a nigga gone
OG status the world lookin' at us
We shinin' like diamonds and our bitches is the baddest
Look at my

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Never change mane, I do this shit for Pimp
Still keep it trill, still shinin' on them wimps
Fuck what you talkin', bitch I'm still ballin'
Hit the boulevard on the 4's yeah they crawlin'
Like Gators we some true H-Town players
Run the city like I'm the mayor
Been gettin', still ain't fall off
Still coming down clean reppin' for that North
Talk the talk, do the walk like Thugga walk
Say whatever but them shinin' like Thugga shine
What them boys talking bout mane, I been on my grind
Still comin' down clean, piece and chain shine

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
Still the realest nigga in it
Did it independent
Made it out the hood, I told them boys I'm gonna get it
Got tired of being broke, instead of live for less
I'm tryna keep a new piece of chain on my chest
Still do it for the city, never gon' stop
Tryna keep the real niggas at the top
Stacking my stacks
Still buyin' new 'Lacs
Still sellin' out the stores like my shit crack
I still gotta keep it trill mane
Aye fuck what they do I keep it real mane
Aye been shinin' since the grill mane
Been coming down, no deal mane
