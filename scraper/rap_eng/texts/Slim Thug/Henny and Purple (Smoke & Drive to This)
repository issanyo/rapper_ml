[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Got 4 homies in the ride now, ashtray on each door
Yeah, trying to make it feel like it used to
We're out here looking for, something to believe in
Slow it down, down, down
See that clock ticking slow on the dash
Picking up the pieces that we left in the past

[Hook:]
Henny and purple, up in the sky
Spinning in circles, chasing the life
Henny and purple, henny and purple, henny and purple
Henny with the purple, mix it in the circle
Side of that kush yeah... push

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Pushing bout 90 on the large now
Where's the liquor store?

Cause we're out here looking for, something to believe in
Slow it down, down, down
See that clock ticking slow on the dash
Picking up the pieces what we left in the past

[Hook:]
Henny and purple, up in the sky
Spinning in circles, chasing the life
Henny and purple, henny and purple, henny and purple
Henny with the purple, mix it in the circle

[Slim Thug:]
Henny with purple, mix it in the circle
Side of that kush yeah... push
And the player so high, feeling like I got wings
I'm floating in the sky, living like I'm in the dream
And we pourin up and blowing up, smoke up in the air
Drinking and we lighten up, it's a perfect pair
Rolling with my partners, we leaning while we roll
Four deep in the slab and we looking for some hoes
Let it go, roll up some more, pour up some more
After this I'm a be laid on the floor
Wasted, but it's so good when you taste it
I'm addicted to this shit, might as well face it
Can't shake it, white cup stay full
Keep the blunt lit till I get the last pull
If you trying to feel good mayne, this will work
Sleeping all day when I'm gone

[Hook:]
Henny and purple, up in the sky
Spinning in circles, chasing the life
Henny and purple, henny and purple, henny and purple
Henny with the purple, mix it in the circle
Side of that kush yeah... push
