[Intro: Slim Thug + LeToya]
Bridgetown (H-Town)

[Killa Kyleon]
Run that back up in the hood again, wh-where it's all good again
Ri-riding candy slab, gr-gripping on that wood again
I got that bread, I walk that walk, yeah that's why I talk that talk
Let my down my flip, pop up my trunk, but on my life I spark the dark
I'm on that um (moving slow), jamming that screw (my music slow)
Tipping four, my jewels they glow, you all make it rain, I make it snow
Downtown where I usually go, hit that door I walk straight in
VIP yeah that's my space, don't do no eights, my top be ten

[Verse 1: LeToya]
It's H-Town chick, like you already know
Call me Mrs Baird because I'm making dough
My coup√© topless, capricorn by my toe
Richest skinny on my hips, Louis on my toes

[Hook: Slim Thug + LeToya]
I hear your money talking, but you ain't loud enough
It cost to be a boss, but you ain't got enough
You got to get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up
Now get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up
What you know about VVS rocking, rubberbands popping
Black cards swiping, copping everything you liking
Get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up
Now get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up

[Verse 2: LeToya]
I'm back at it, been gone for a minute
Busy galleria shopping and running my own business
Had to shake a couple haters, haters thought I was finished
They say time is money, so I'm stacking every minute
H-Town representer, yeah you already know
You might spot me in the office packing rose eight mo'
Walk it out in my giuseppes, to the valet I go
If I ain't workin wood wheel, drivers open my door

[Hook: Slim Thug + LeToya]
I hear your money talking, but you ain't loud enough
It cost to be a boss, but you ain't got enough
You got to get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up
Now get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up
What you know about VVS rocking, rubberbands popping
Black cards swiping, copping everything you liking
Get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up
Now get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up

[Verse 3: LeToya]
It's the T-O-Y-A, everybody know
Rockin St. Laurent with the Jimmy Choo patent pumps
Gotta be fly first class when I'm on the go
Watch me ride this beat, bass beating in my trunk
Now while you still on your Louis Vuitton, I'm rocking Louboutin
In my droptop Benz, with your man stalking
And like B say 'let me upgrade ya'
Well, LT say 'swagger up, baby'

[Verse 4: Bun B]
You see my chain game is crazy and my piece game is player
My fit game is fire and my shoe game'll slay ya
My wrist game ready and my whip game proper
When I pull up on a bopper, I'm a real showstopper
Bun B, king of the trill, born and raised
Down in Texas, where these boys be running game for days
If your girl is in the building when I spot her I'mma snag her
Better luck next time, partner, step up your swagger

[Hook: Slim Thug + LeToya]
I hear your money talking, but you ain't loud enough
It cost to be a boss, but you ain't got enough
You got to get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up
Now get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up
What you know about VVS rocking, rubberbands popping
Black cards swiping, copping everything you liking
Get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up
Now get your swagger up, yeah get your swagger up
(Get your swagger up, baby)

[Outro: Bun B]
Man, get your swagger up, baby
Especially if you coming to H-Town, baby
Cause we really go down down here, know what I'm saying
Get you money right, get your fly right, you know what I'm saying
Step it up, baby, step it up, going down
Bun B, 'till I call it on
And H-Town fly, Le-T-O-Y-A, LeToy
You already know, baby
