[Slim Thug]
It's a recession, but we still gettin' money
We gon' balance our budgets all over your ass, mother fucker!

[Hook: Peter Hadar]
Still a boss
Still getting checks
Still getting this paper
But just a little less, just a little less
Still getting money, I'm still getting checks
Still getting this paper, but just a little less
Just a little less
Count my paper

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
It's Slim Thugga mother fucka
Known as the boss
Running the game because I cut all costs
And the recession hit rappers like a bullet to the shoulder
They're dodging phone calls from their court note holders
Yeah you lost all your cash flying G5 planes
I'm still flying first, thanks John Maynard Keynes
Trying to beat Scarface I cut costs to the end
You're broke, say hello to my little friend

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I don't pop bottles at the club, it costs too much
Better take some shots of Patron and shut the hell hell up
Plus up at Costco, it's half the cash
I buy a bottle for what you're spending on one glass
When them strippers rush off stage to VIP
I make them pay a fee just to dance with me
Thugga never make it rain in the club no more
It's gon' be a Sunday night when I fall in that hole
Can I get a tip? Drill back? Hell no
If you ain't coming home with me what am I paying you for?
I'm balling on a budget bitches
You can't get my riches
My pockets sewed up like a cut full of stitches

[Bridge: Peter Hadar]
Used to blow through money when the Dow looked sunny
Now when I fall, accountants act funny
Who buys shares in AIG?
Thanks for the advice in the NBC
Got me tracking S and P
Now I'm mad at my money, mad at my money

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
My crew roll deep always spending my stacks
So I made them all dependents on my income tax
If IRS asks, I'mma say they're my sons
And if that don't work, tax man, show my forms
1099 and the W-4
Yeah, I'm blasting mother fuckers with my credit score
Mortgage paid off, Got a house that I own
I traded in the Bentley call it cash for chrome
Four G's back, and eight new whips
Boss Hogg Outlawz, we push Smart Cars

[Hook]

[Outro: Peter Hadar]
I'm skimping on my pimping
