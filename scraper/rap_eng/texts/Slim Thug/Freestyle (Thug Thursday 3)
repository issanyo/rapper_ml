You know I’m saying man
Nigga here just chilling like a motherfucker man
Tryna make it do what it do man
Junior Genius

Jun’ you really is a genius
I really mean this
Where the green is
I’m tryna make some green hits
Talking bout plaques
Roller Rolls Royce, used to Rolex
Still counting up stacks
I’m riding round town like the Mac
Got plenty bad bitches
Got plenty bad bitches tryna pay me riches
Got plenty player haters
Got plenty player haters tryna come and take em
Got plenty real niggas
Got plenty real niggas riding with us
And we got plenty hittas
Couple killers down the gun pull them triggers

We ain’t worried bout you man
We ain’t worried bout you man
We just doing what we do man
We just doing what we do man
Coming through like checkmate
Stay winning in and out of state
Today I’m in my best shape
I can’t lie, life getting great, aye

All about getting cake and that money coming fast
Gotta hustle slightly ill to ill
And I’m still shining cause I’m still grinding
Hell yeah, thug still here
Seventeen years later paper still growing
Niggas stay watching my moves
But fuck it, I’m a help out mine
Went to how to be a boss school, thuggery

Pull up in the drop head, might pull up in a Spur
Just walked in and pick a bitch
Was like, fuck it I’m a take her
And I never hear no “No’s”
Cause a nigga get money get money like a boss
Two decades later and bitches still ain’t feel out, thugger
I’m the motherfucking Mac
Riding round town making my paper stack
Got a bad bitch on my line I’m like baby let me hit you back
Shoulda already hit so it’d just be a waste of my time
Might as well hi the studio and get back on my grind

Cause I ain’t got time to be fucking with you hoes
Who ain’t gon’ bring a nigga no dough
I ain’t got time to deal with you niggas
Who are not here tryna chase figures
I ain’t got time to ride around Houston
Chilling with a bunch of niggas that’s losing
I’ gotta keep moving, I gotta move moving
Get a bigger house, get a better car
Get a badder boat, huh
Thugger never satisfied, I’m a always want more, huh
Yeah I gotta keep going, I gotta keep growing
I ain’t gon’ never stop
And when I check out this bitch
I’m a still be sitting at the top, thugger
Talking River Oaks with them white folks and big mansion, aye
Talking 20,000 sq ft, tell em make some expansions, aye
Pork and candy slab, in my yard smoking weed looking just like a nigga, aye
But they ain’t gon’ say shit, that nigga getting his figures

Cause bitch I’m the boss, still ain’t fall off
Still getting them fat cheques, aye
You can tell when you see my ass
And all this shit hanging off my neck, aye
Independent hall of fame, can somebody get me my respect
Been getting money in the city, still ain’t turned by back on the city
Cause bitch I’m the boss, never gon’ fall off
Never gon’ fall off, never gon’ fall off
Cause bitch I’m the boss, huh
You see my motherfucking house
Bitch I’m the boss
Thugger
What the fuck they talking bout man
