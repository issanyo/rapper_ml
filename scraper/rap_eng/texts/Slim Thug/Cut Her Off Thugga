[Hook: Slim Thug]
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
So what you saying ho?
You know I'm the man ho?

[Verse: Slim Thug]
I had to cut that bitch off that's what you get for playin' ho
I'm all about my grams ho, make me more stupid
And if you can't you useless like Chris Brown I'm throwin' deuces
Gotta keep my car coupeish if you wanna be my new bitch
They be like Thugga you rich why we still gotta do this
I don't fuck with no broke bitches only fuck with hustlers
How you fine with no money better go get some customers
I fuck 'em but don't trust 'em
I cut 'em but don't love 'em
Got pimpin' in my blood always put my money abve 'em
I see you lames cuffin' , but you ain't stopping nothing
Got your bitch in my bed givin' head 'til I'm busting
She say she got a rush fucking with a thug nigga
She say she tired of losing fucking with them scrub niggas
She say them tricks only good for buyin' new kicks
So she break 'em for their bread, then hop back on daddy dick
