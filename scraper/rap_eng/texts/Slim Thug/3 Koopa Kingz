Slim Thugga

Drank by the pint,
Dro by the pound.
Headed to the club and tha boss top down.
Slim Thug bout to grind, represent H-Town
If you love me you gon smile,
If you hate me you gon frown
On a hunt and up, guess what I just found
Come in VIP with me, we post up
We blowin purple stuff,
we pouring purple stuff
We glowing from wrist up,
you can tell that we great people

When I hit the club all the girls show me love,
buying out the bar got drank by the jug
In the V.I.P. with the chicks and the drugs
This is T-I-P, Bun B, and Slim Thug.
