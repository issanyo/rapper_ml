Thank you Lord for your plenty blessings
And the many lessons you save me when I was stressing
Answered all my questions plenty time it could be my time
But I ducked at the right time I got away at the right time
What the hell could I be thinking I couldn't have been thinking
But thank you for thinking about me I was too busy drinking
I was too busy pulling up too busy blowing up
Wasn’t through growing up but I don’t give a
Had to get smarter because it just ain’t about me
I have three kids father the smart thing to do is hustle harder
Just lost my brother is just first quarter
RIP Sha lue I need you heavenly father

Please I come to you lord thank you for your mercy
Your grace your patience
Thank you for forgiving me over and over
We miss you bro you were a hell of a father
Look at your daughter look at your son
That’s why u were as real as they come
My juniors taking it hard I told them take it to God
We all going through it and it’s going to be hard to do it
Use to seeing your face daily and it’s getting crazy
I see your face when I see you babies
Man this shit is crazy I can’t believe it happen to up
But the whole hood showed up
Show love hit the parking got towed up
Put your hats up look like stars at your funeral
Cowboy swag we can’t protect you at your funeral
The best funeral I ever seen was such a sad beautiful thing
We going to be strong as long as God on our team

Dear God I thank you for your many blessings
In the good times and I thank you for the strength
Through the bad times
Today I actually bring my family in peace
For the lost of our love ones
And give us the power to smile throughout the heart ache
And I know you proud of us watching us from above
All you brother out together I’m praying for you
Lost a husband and a sun the same week
I thought she was tough but she got to be tougher than me
Never know when it’s your last time to say goodbye
So make sure before you say goodbye your love ones can
See that love in your eyes don’t get caught by surprise
Being petty lifes too short and when it’s your time
You might not be ready lost a lot of my people
You in a better place just got some new bed
RIP LA If you lost someone you love I hope you stay strong
Like what he say one day you here and the next day you gone

Dear God I know my family and friends I have lost
Are up there in heaven with you
So instead of being sad I lean on faith
Knowing that you would never let me down
And I’m the sun of our king of king
I won’t give up or misrepresent you or my people
In heaven I will continue to live strong
And holler all y'all names up along all the way
Amen
