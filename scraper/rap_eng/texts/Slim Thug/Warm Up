[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Bitch I'm balling
If a player ball I would be MVP
You niggas ain't got stats like me
I'm MJ to you Kobes
Got old money , getting new money
Gold rollie looking too sunny
Was on the block broke looking bummy
Got on my grind now I'm stunting
Pulling up in whatcha want
Damn Thugga you stay flaunting
Keep a bad bitch you wish you fuck
I'm a millionaire like Scrooge McDuck
Lay on my bread like it's a bed
Lord please keep away them FED's
I'm having fun ridin' in my Rari
Top off getting super head
Bad bitches, they love Thug
Almost like they love drugs
I keep atleast ten in the club
Need molly and weed- I'm the plug
Passing out them party favors
Until everybody pass out
Wake up with three in my bed
And they all got their ass out
Keep a foreign on glass house
That's chrome rims for you slow niggas
Thugga still getting more figures
And I wasting none on gold diggers
Better hide your hoes nigga
It's a known fact I go get her
Hit her once and then I quit her
Get ride of her like piece of litter
I'm still shining like I'm covered in glitter
Still buzzing like a bee hive
Still tippin' on four fours, when I'm rolling one in my old rides
Still sip syrup like it's coffee
Can't keep these bad bitches off me
You pay the gold play with these dimes
Zero cents is what it costs me
They still say I'm so flossy
I say cause I stay keep it real
When I was broke I rapped about it
Now I'm living good up in them hills
Still stacking up more mills
Bitch I'm still balling
Its Thugga motherfucker, still climbing while you falling
