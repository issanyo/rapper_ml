(Intro)
Welcome to Texas
3rd time
Slim Thugger
Paul Wall
Mr. Rogers

(Chorus)
Uh, she want it, she want it
When she see me on them swings hitting condoms
Wutchu think? Poppin drink with Diana
A mile gone, Styrofoam got me far gone
Getting throwed, see me in the front now them bottles wanna roll
Uh, mouth piece full of gold
Shining on you haters then you hold
Don’t worry, know I…

(Verse)
Celebration, paper chasin with no hesitation
I’m higher than a Colorado elevation
One nation smoking killa, codeine tastin
My cabinet got more pain killers than a cancer pacient
One time for my home boys is gone
It’s why I’m smoking, I’m leanin and I’m gone
If you don’t get high then I suggest you gone
I’mma smoke until it’s gone
Gone, gone, I’m gone, mixed up
I’m pourin up, nothing but murr
I’m rolling up, nothing but that good buzz
Paul Wall, bitch war, much love
Crawling like a bug, riding with my judge, hold up

(Chorus)
Uh, she want it, she want it
When she see me on them swings hitting condoms
Wutchu think? Poppin drink with Diana
A mile gone, Styrofoam got me far gone
Getting throwed, see me in the front now them bottles wanna roll
Uh, mouth piece full of gold
Shining on you haters then you hold
Don’t worry, know I…

(Verse)
I’m leanin, sippin, got the hoes with tippin
Keep a slap paint drippin, watch me give them boys a whippin
When they see me pull up holling
Chain and watches golden
On the void I’m rolling, tryna find a find I’m strolling
It’s south star, better cuff yo bitches
Or we gon send em back to your room lookin suspisious
She bumpin out my riches, I down em by the dozen
She said my dick delicious, yea her and your little cousin
Drank and weed got me buzzin, swear I’m close to that gurr
I fall asleep on syrup, bumpers getting on my nerves
She blowing up my bong, pass it by my home
Please leave me alone, I got money on my dome

(Chorus)
Uh, she want it, she want it
When she see me on them swings hitting condoms
Wutchu think? Poppin drink with Diana
A mile gone, Styrofoam got me far gone
Getting throwed, see me in the front now them bottles wanna roll
Uh, mouth piece full of gold
Shining on you haters then you hold
Don’t worry, know I…
