[Intro:]
Ah!, push it, push it
Thugga!
Ah!, push it, (hold up) push it

[Verse 1:]
Was a young nigga movin dat dope
Never got used to being broke
Keep kush smoke in ma throat
Keep a slab wid candy coats
All ma niggas sell dope, all ma bitches get money
Young OG in d game, but I’m still gettin new hunids
Never gettin tired of stuntin, ma window up still runnin
Where d money at, I’m comin, buying a rose grill wit d women
Got bad bitches like Draya, what can I say I’m a playa
Pink pussy slaya fuck wit Brie ain’t gotta pay her
One day might try to run for mayor, I’m a mothafuckin boss
No mo’ chickens in d kitchen I can’t take another loss
Plus dese snitches out there snitchin, takin all ma niggas out
Had to get up on ma biz now I’m switchin up d route
Paid d cult to be d boss now d shit is paying out
Now d chicks keep comin I ain’t never seeing droughts
Everybody fellin off while I keep excelling out
Even when ma spelling off ma shit be still selling off
Thugga

[Verse 2:]
I’m a boss bitch wit ma own shit
Go harder than yo nigga do
I like street niggas wit big dicks
Who eat d pussy like it’s food
The thug niggas that pay good
If you gon’ be fuckin me, I need d house keys an shoppin sprees
I’m a bad bitch wit maintenance fees
Pull up in dat foreign, if I see yo bitch I might take yo bitch
Take her home to ma nigga, run a train all up on yo bitch
I’m d main bitch you d side bitch
Give me sling bags an fly trips
He keep me happy so I ride d dick
You fuckin for french fries bitch!
Pussy so good make him fall in love
Surfboarding on dat dick all in a tub
Guaranteed to be d baddest bitch in d club
In d section wit dem niggas that be bossed up
(Bossed up,bossed up.bossed up, bossed up)
