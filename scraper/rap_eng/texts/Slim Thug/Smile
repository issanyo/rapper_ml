I'm So Fly
All the haters and the killers try'na get me
When I walk by
All the girls wanna take a picture with me
So baby just smile for the camera (Ayy)
For the camera (Ayy)
For the camera (Ayy)
So baby just smile for the camera (Ayy)
For the camera (Ayy)
For the camera (Ayy)
Ha

[Verse 1]
I got super size swag, I'm honest with the class
Fresh up out the bag, somebody pull out my tag
I guess that's why these haters always looking so mad
I guess that's why this girl wanna picture so bad
Her heart beatin fast, while we froze for the pose
Before rap, I was most chose by the hoes
Before you go she slid me something else on the low
It read dial this to see me with no clothes

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Beautiful by the bar, you wanna be a star?
Live like a boss in the big house and fancy car
How bout we make everything that's mine ours
For example let me let'cha hold a black card
And don't worry bout'cha man, he just act hard
Before he get to you, he gotta go through that squad
Ya like swimming, I gotta lake in my backyard
I'll take you on a date to the B.E.T. Awards

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Keep that ice on our chest...
And we dress so fly...
And we stay smoking on the best...
So you know a playa so high...
So baby just smile for the camera (Ayy)
For the camera (Ayy)
For the camera (Ayy)
So baby just smile for the camera (Ayy)
For the camera (Ayy)
For the camera (Ayy)
Ha
