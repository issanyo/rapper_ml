[Intro]
[Thug, I’m a wanna take this over, zilla, zilla, zilla
Hold up, hold up, hold up, club going]

[Hook]
Northside hold up, I ain’t nothing but a thug nigga
I’m the only one that ran up on them drug dealers
Got two bitches in my muhfuckin car with me
Twin bottles, twenty bottles got the whole squad with me
I just get it in, I just get it in
Hold up I just get it in, I just get it in
Yeah, yeah I just get it in, I just get it in
Hold up, I just get it in
Fuck a bitch and her friend

[Verse 1]
I just get it in, fuck a bitch and her friend
I just came through new Maybach Benz
Had em pour up a whole fo in the Lean
I done drop the top on that ‘Rari on the feeta
I just pulled up bitch showed up like a smadge
I’m a be a real nigna tell her I’m in the casket
Snuck up in the club with my 45 cause it’s plastic
Hustle DNA, if I want it, I’m a have it
Been about that’s established
Made meals with a tablet
Niggas out here grabbing
Hate to see a nigga happy
Showed up with everything
Still getting that change
Independent fuck fame, OG with the name

[Hook]
Northside hold up, I ain’t nothing but a thug nigga

[Verse 3]
I just get it in got the club going crazy
Bottles back to back bobbing on it like a baby
Bunch a bad bitches busting it open for a boss
Hella Benzes, Beemers back to back at the house
Damn it’s super sunny and they all super chunky
My shit on steroids while your diamonds looking musty
All my partners drug dealers, hustlers getting paid
Got the mil on the juice and we all self paid
I’m so proud of me, I’m so proud of me
Went and got it on my own fuck the lottery
Boss life from the bottom to the top
And I’m still climbing high ain’t gon’ stop

[Hook]
Northside hold up, I ain’t nothing but a thug nigga
I’m the only one that ran up on them drug dealers
Got two bitches in my muhfuckin car with me
