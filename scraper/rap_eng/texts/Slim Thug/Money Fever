[Verse 1:][Sauce Walka]
Lord forgive me
These pussy niggas gotta die for their envy
Who want it
Come get it
I’m out here everyday
Come on and see me
I’m a changed nigga
Be live
Ask me
I don’t see you pussies
Bout to pass me
And another nigga tryna harass me
What the fuck is you talkin bout
Nigga who you shot
Nobody
Lemme see what that chick about
What kinda car you drive
A Ram 4 nigga
You a fuckin ho nigga
A nobody know nigga
But [?] be pimpin
Cause already trippin
And fuckin these women
You a baby daddy
Sad and unhappy
Yeah bitch
I done ran out with the flavour
Pussy come and catch me
Runnin with the set
Runnin with the straps
Runnin with the sauce
Runnin with your bitch
(your bitch)
You in love with her
But everyday on Instagram
She on my dick

[Chorus:]
Laud mercy Jesus [x2]
I got money fever
Laud mercy Jesus
I done ran off with the set [x2]
(i’m running)
I done ran off with the set [x2]
Laud mercy Jesus [x2]
I got money fever
Laud mercy Jesus
I done ran off with the set [x2]
(I’m running)
I done ran off with the set
You know Sauce I will never look back

[Verse 2:][Slim Thug]
I done ran off with the set
I done ran off with the set
I spend it and get it right back
I spend it and get it right back
Laud mercy Jesus
I got money fever
Your bitch said I didn’t hit
Don’t believe her
I’ve been all between her
She gotta make me more rich
Before I plead you
I don’t need you
Rather brag a pimp
Than sack that
Before I delete you
Judge
Now Slim Thug mouthin off
Ride it out
Had to find it out
Fuck being broke
Rather be a boss though
I kept climbing out
Chasing that set till i caught it
If I want it I bought it
My hustle game retarded
All them lames got out smarted
Still at the top with the sack
Still at the top with the sack
Broke I’ll never go back
Broke I’ll never go back
Thugga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:][Sancho Saucy]
I done ran out with your bitch
I done ran out with your sister
Sancho got that hoes Aston Kucher
Sancho  be sharper than butcher
Yeah that’s your ho till I took her
Sancho I'm Jesus
Pray bitches need me
All the crips love sanch like I’m easy
But they I'm bleeding
Soo wooh

Put it on a chopper
Put it on [?]
Put it on pic
Slick nigga wid it
Fuck what he did
Fuck what he said
Aim it at his head
Bitch I bang red
Bitch I'm blood gang
Red ruby rang
I love Lebron James
I done ran off with the sack
With three hoes to Miami
My bitch broke a trick for ten racks on the beach
While she tanning
Cold Rolex
Back to Houston, Texas
Sancho punking rappers cause it's reckless
Niggas goin respect it
Dare ya to touch my necklace. ON SAUCE!
(don’t do it)

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Like… the dope man get up everyday and go to his dope corner right?
But we got up just once a year and go to our dope corner
But that dope corner was sooooo fucking…
Man it’s just that everybody got out there
It’s like 15, 20 niggas out there for this life
15, 20 niggas gotta service 500,000 people they dope
