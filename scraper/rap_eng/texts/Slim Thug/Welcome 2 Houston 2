Nah'm talkin' bout

Welcome to Houston

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Big city in the Country State
Say we the fattest 'cuz the food here taste great
Steak and lobster for brunch, I like big meals
See the oldschool caddies with the big wheels
Had to see the Texas and the dropdome[?]
Put out the weed, ain't no telling what them cops on
By the time this dropped my nigga Shotty[?] got home
Hit the superbowl smelling like a pound of strong
Looking like King Kong when you see me
Paid the cost, being the boss ain't easy
Might be courtside on ya tv
Same night, at the local bar, chilling with a star

[Verse 2: GT Garzia]
Hopped the bar from the city of the purple
Shooting for the stars, and you ain't nowhere near my circle
Anytime I'm out they think I'm shooting a commercial
The top go in the trunk, and all the doors go in reversal
Made it off my hustle, now a limo just a long car
Call me Michael Knight, conversating with my own car
Show up fresh to death, my preachers seen me and said "oh Lawd"
Space Jams on me like I got 'em off a [?]
Great tape collector, I got Screw all in my mindframe
Diamonds on the bezel, 360 where the time hang
Park it in the front the rims stretch out in the driveway
Forgies hit the block and change colors on the highway
100 dollar Nikes on, money-grip python
Diamonds shine like MGM[?] like you think the fight's on
Mobbin' thru the west, [?]
They love in the mall, I'm a grocerystore icon
Linked-up with the Boss, now I'm feeling like an outlaw
PJ in that [?] back when they were yelling "Boss Hog!"
Texas independent, labels we did it without y'all
Leaning sideways when sitting in the Southpaw
Call me [?] on that instrumental
Everytime they playin' "Ghetto Dreams" man I get sentimental
Legendary status, only do it if it's monumental
Wanna take my spot, but you ain't got it in you

[Verse 3: Propain]
Look, slow down is how we rockin' nigga
Glocks extended, all black like a 5%'er
Wet paint, a lotta ice but got the hottest winters
Come around this bitch without that flex and get yo pockets [?]
Pro'
A lot of pimp and 2pac up in 'em
Baddest brawls, fuck the same girls as all the [?] members

?
Rest in peace to DJ Screw, I hope I'm doing them southies justice

[Verse 4: Killa Kyleon]
Reportin' live from them trenches, same city J. Prince is
Sippin' purple rain like Prince's, might pull-up [?]
Keep codeine in my kidneys, my jewelry's worth two Bentleys
That's a [?], I'm Usain, for the loose change I'm sprintin'
[?]
Get the guac' cause I'm hot, y'all counting me out
Real nigga they bop, fake nigga I'm not
I don't speak to no cops, I'm in the streets with them knots
I keep a miracle watch, I keep it lyrical tho
H-Town like it slow, in the caddy sittin' low
[?]
Legendary that 70's smokin' rappers like a blunt [?] lit
Glass-set[?] out the 80's, cadillac from the 70's


[Verse 5: De'lorean]
Too much money in the city
Er'body got a hustle, if you want it you gotta see it boy
Yeah
I flipped the brim on my fitted, throw my deuce out the ceilin'[?]
This is really how I'm feelin mane
Bitchnigga get no convo
Nah player that ain' egg, that's that almost
Boy you tryna leave a print round my style fo?
This shit up and down like the Dow Jones
Hit the milestone, I'm just running 'til my knees poppin'
These boys ain't hustlin', they just eavesdroppin'
Niggas waiting on the call, I guess he's floppin'
Man I'm killin' so much shit, I'mma knee[?] [?]
Stop it
I'm just hoping that they reset me
Keep stepping on them haters, I can't respect them
Boss-like sneakers looking like some Giuseppe's
Thugger showed me [?]
Real niggas get a check for the superbowl
Supercoupe, fo' do's, that's the uber doe
Paul Wall stay down [?]
?
Don't pull up in traffic, we leave you mortified
Ghostes[?] and Bentleys sittin' like[?] quarterpies[?]
Apologise, for all the drugs glorified
Welcome to Houston nigga, I am ya tourguide

[Verse 6: Doughbeezy]
Welcome to Houston, where we hustle 'till we pass out
And all the bitches' booties look like they was born with ass-shots
Run with them bulls, but I ain't talking 'bout no mascots
So come into my city acting silly and get your ass shot
They stole the culture the first time that they came around it
And you not a real drank-sipper just 'cuz you hang around it
You outta-towners don't know a thing about it
But this is Houston where trunks knocking and [?]
The haters doubt it, but we made it out as the main attraction
And I bet someone from Houston influenced your favourite rapper
Then made it faster than someone that's from the city
So excuse me for this chip on my shoulder I carry with me
I'm rapping like I got a point to prove, it's time for boys to move
Gave the city my whole life and I just can't afford to lose
Pick or choose, pay the player build a buzz by making moves
And if you don't pay attention, you fuck around and make the news
Cause you can't snooze all these jackers 'round here
?City full of cheeseheads but ain't no 'Packers round here
Niggas quick to shoot them clips but ain't no actors 'round here
So disrespect and you gon' end up target practice 'round here
Down here in Houston, Texas it's best that you just respect us
But don't be too friendly, because a nigga will take yo necklace
Your best bet is the [?] because a nigga will take yo Lexus
And then go pull up at a chop-shop and get broke off by some Mexicans
See, I ain't tryna harm you, really I'm just tryna warn you
We got them sunny days,  but you are not in California
And this ain't Hollywood, so if you thinkin' that you good
A nigga will pistol-whip you in the parking lot, just like he should

Welcome to Houston, nigga
