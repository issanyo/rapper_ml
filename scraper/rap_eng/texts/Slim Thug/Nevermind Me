[Verse 1]
Used to be a Trap-Star, now I’m a Rap-Star
Everyday I wake up I gotta go outside and pick a car
Living like a movie star, living like a drug lord
I be in them streets everyday, no bodyguards
That’s how niggas real get respect in the city
Plus they know I keep that '45 riding with me
And fuck my kidneys cause this drank it got me gone
They say double U, bring this back and make a song
Still wrecking likes at the top of the dome
Still coming down dripping candy on the throne

[Hook 2x]
Never  mind me I’m just over here balling
Staying on my grind yeah, I’m tryna find my calling
Bitches see me and they immediately start following
Wanna ride with yeah and we gon’ let em all in

[Verse 2]
Put a couple choppers in the trunk when I ride
That’s just how we do it coming off that Northside
I ain’t looking for no trouble, I’m just tryna stay alive
There’s wolves in the streets, I’m just tryna survive
Let her hit that test say yes you’ll soon see
Pull that chopper out if it spraying, R.I.P
We ain’t worried bout you we just tryna get rich
Pull up in them big rim Benzes with the kits
Big Benz’s with the kit, AMG loaded
Every time I hit that boulevard, we get noticed
Rolling up them fat jays used to smoke them roaches
Now we chi chung whole peas with the focus

[Hook]
Never  mind me I’m just over here balling
Staying on my grind yeah, I’m tryna find my calling
Bitches see me and they immediately start following
Wanna ride with yeah and we gon’ let em all in
Never  mind me I’m just over here balling
Staying on my grind yeah, I’m tryna find my calling
Bitches see me and they immediately start following
Wanna ride with yeah and we gon’ let em all in

[Outro]
Thugga, aye
