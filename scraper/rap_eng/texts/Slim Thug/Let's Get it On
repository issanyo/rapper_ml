Don't speak, if you don't think you can back it up
Cause us real niggas ready, we done had enough
Couple raps in, now but y'all ain't adding up
Quit gassing em up, who his ass ain't tough

[H.A.W.K.]
The streets out there that's talking shit, niggas out there that's riding dick
Talking down on the Screwed Up Click, they must don't know who they fucking with
Five star general of the S.U.C., want my click gotta go through me
Go through Ke and Mike D, then you gotta go through Big Pokey
Who a nigga know as hard as me, who a nigga know is smart as me
Niggas wanna know how hard is he, I'm hard as the boss more ravage D
Get your ass in like a rod and real, hardest nigga out there with no deal
Crawling through niggas like a snow mobile, and I make shit that the real can feel
Now all you niggas know, that I got hella flow
And I got hella do', and where that came from I got a whole lot mo'
It's time to settle the sco', for those who claiming best
Y'all niggas can place your bets, cause the best rest in your T-E-X
So who's got next, step to the booth
I smash em one at a time, or I'll just smash the whole group
Big H.A.W.K. done flew the coupe, so what's y'all talking bout
H-A-Dub-K, I'm calling niggas out

[Hook: Scooby]
Don't speak, if you don't think you can back it up
Cause us real niggas ready, we done had enough
Couple raps in, now but y'all ain't adding up
Quit gassing em up, who his ass ain't tough
Let's get it on mayn, let's get it on hey
Let's get it on mayn, gotta get my money long
Let's get it on mayn, let's get it on hey
Let's get it on, I'm a hustler I ain't coming home

[Paul Wall]
I got big money big cars, big chains and big Glocks
Playboy bunnies in cuts or bar, I'm holding grain in candy drops
Counting stacks and bleeding blocks, when the boys talk down and they hate
But I'm not too concerned with them fools, I'm trying to get my paper straight
I'm all real but they all fake, all talk all hype
All games but not a playa, they all bark but no bite
They throw the South with all they might, me I'm not the plexing type
But I'm no punk bitch no not quite, I'm pieced up and I bar no fight
They chatter boxers, steady talking down on real G's
But keep it cool just like the breeze, playa like me about that cheese
Plenty noise my actions speak, this gangsta team is so elite
I'm representing that Swishahouse, and all haters can kiss the cheek
All haters can kill theyself, if you don't like me then come and fight me
Put him in check just like some Nikes, and whoop that ass so-so politely
If you can't walk the walk, then really it ain't no need to talk
Let's get it on and we'll break you off, it's Paul Wall and Big H.A.W.K

[Slim Thug]
These boys be talking reckless, like they be running Texas
Cause they done got a set of rims, and a diamond necklace
That got em feeling swoll, and got em feeling cold
Live with they mamas, but swear they ball out of control
Got some radio play, and a song that people like
You done it my nigga, now let me see ya do it twice
And again and again, for ten years win
What you gon do, when you show Thug what you spin
And they drop in a Benz, your body style old
I got long jevity in the game, cause my game thoed
I'm the Boss of the South, and I can back it up
And I'll ride on you haters, if you acting up
I been stacking up, since I was 17
Been in the city, in every car that you think clean
And I'm still getting green, my checks ain't stopped yet
So when you see the Boss, show the Boss some respect
