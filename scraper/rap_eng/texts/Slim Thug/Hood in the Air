(Intro)
North side in this motherfucka
North side in this motherfucka
North side in this motherfucka
North side in this motherfucka
G'yea
South side in this motherfucka
G'yea
East side, west side, nigga

(Verse 1, Slim Thug)
I'm in the old school big L-Dogg, sittin sideways
Headed north on 45
I'm in the old school big L-Dogg, sittin sideways
North on 45
I'm in the old school big L-Dogg, sittin sideways
Headed north on 45 highway
Geto Boys in the CD deck
Cause you gotta show the old school g's respect
I got the Glock 4-5 on my right side
Cause that's how you roll, when ya got'cha self a nice ride
Won't catch me slippin
Think I'm trippin?
Bound to catch a ass-whippin
I got candy on my ride, shuttin down the ave
And I'm tippin on fo's, so I'm low to the slab
Paint so blue, haters callin me crab
I'm lookin good, every time I stop they givin me dab
I'm thumbs-up when I creep down the cut
Hydro smoke got a nigga high as fuck
I'm Slim Thugga motherfucka, representin the North
And I do it like a boss every time I floss

(Hook, Slim Thug)
Oh yeah
Throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care, oh yeah
Throw ya neighbor hood in the air
If ya don't care

(Verse 2)
I'm in a car worth more than ya house
If you wanna be me, you gotta pay that cost
Pay them ese's to gon' spray that gloss
So you can look good every time ya floss
Shot out to Ike, he got me lookin right
I guess what I heard wasn't south-side hype
I'm lookin good in the hood when I pass through
Boyz in Blue, you know how we do
Keep drank poured up in the cup
I'm in a mink-coat, laid back on a buck
Got twenty fo's on the Escalade truck
Throw ya hood up if ya don't give a fuck, nigga

(Hook)

(Outro)
Throw the north-side in the air
Throw the south-side in the air
Throw the east-side in the air
Throw the west-side in the air
