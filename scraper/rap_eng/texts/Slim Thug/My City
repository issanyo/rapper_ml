[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

I put it down for my city mayne. (My city mayne)

Don’t give a fuck about what niggas gon’ say ‘bout me (say ‘bout me)

I still rockin’ gold grills and I’m swangin’ mayne (I’m swangin’ mayne)

Oh yeah I’m always gon’ be H-Town (H-Town)

[Verse 1: Killa Kyleon]

84’s under my fleetwood

Pockets stay fat cause they eat good

Big finga on my like Eastwood

If a hater try me gon’ sleep good

Seats on lean and my top back

On my right side where your bop at

TV’s lit you can watch that

I got a pump in my trunk if I pop that

5th wheel hangin’ like deuces

I’m on a set of 84’s no deuces

But if I hit this button I’m ruthless

Shaw but shaw (short) and my paint job stupid

Bops love me like cupid

Pull up in the slab get schooled quick

Big wheels poking like two bicks two sick

Grey tape under my screw shit

Four 15’s I’m a freshman
H-Town king I’m a veteran

Big gun on me like a western

Racks in my pocket, I’m countin’ my blessin’

Paint snow bottles in my section

Sleeping like a nigga ain’t restin’

Gettin’ to the money no stressin’

Diamonds on the wood grain wheel I’m pressin’

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]

My trunk bang like gangs

My 4’s swang like swangs

I’m comin’ through them lanes

Rockin’ two chains like 2 Chainz

Every season some new mayne

By now you know how we do thangs

I just bought a Bently betcha cocaine

I’m rollin’ slow and it’s slow like cruisin’

Where the cruiser, ya boys gone pass

Will need a boss peep a weight (or way), I ain’t gotta drive fast

They say 200 on the dash but I ain’t never seen it

Never dream I’d shine this hard, but I hustle like I’m feenin’ beamin’

Like the light when that Cadi take flight

I’m smokin’ on some kites

I’m covered up in ice

I’m with your bitch she lookin’ nice
Got these niggas lookin’ twice

I bust a dime bust a nut and gave her relationship advice, right

At the next light third house on the left

Pullin’ up to the crib five bitches by myself

These niggas can’t keep up I still sweep the streets up

And hustle every day ’til it’s time for me to re-up

Thug (thugga, thugga)

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]

I’m from the city of the syrup

Only young nigga in the city gettin’ heard

Only young nigga in the city getting bread

But the whole damn city wanna hate on Kirk

Fuck y’all niggas but a nigga so real I support y’all niggas

When they ask who cold, I report y’all niggas

Fuck talkin’ ‘bout these hatin’ ass niggas

In the city mayne I ain’t tryna bore y’all niggas

Uh, see it feels so good, but it hurts so bad

Man you weren’t around when I didn’t have cash

Say you weren’t around when I didn’t have a bed

Didn’t have a whip, momma livin’ bad

So I had to take everything out the stash

And I had a number one song on the radio, man a hater talk about my past

Nigga don’t know so I gotta let him know

I was so broke that I made it sound throwed
I ain’t have money so I talked about the hoes

Any sense in the city ain’t got know hope

What the fuck you mean

Nigga I’m the king

I ain’t Pimp C and I ain’t Bun B

I ain’t Slim Thug and I ain’t Keke

Man shout out to the vets but nigga I’m me

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
