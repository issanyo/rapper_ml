Mm
Tell me how you really fee
Tell me how you really feel
I would actually watch a deal
But you don’t even know you deal
Most niggas would’ve deal
Proly steal broke a shit
Yow got a lot fame
What you deal [?] rich
Oh no no one
No one like I do
Never needed no help
Standing on my own too
[?] see you nigga feel
Oh well I still sail
I hold my own shit done
On me to call son
Still stay next time
You all the [?] that change
Dick [?] not a [?]
While it still I know you game
Yow some lame [?] some lames
Ain’t real like me talk shit on the low
No one to fight me
Still keep shit G
Switchin up for what?
They might be on T.V
But still came f*** with us
Boss like boss life
Still run this bitch
Till the day I quit
I’m on the stage now shit
