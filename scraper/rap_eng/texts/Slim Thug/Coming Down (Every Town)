Grooving down, dance around

[Verse 1]
I'm a get there to new shit
All my cars is roofless
All my cars is coupe bitch
I got bad bitches that's stupid
Roll leaves in all colors
All ya'll hoes is thuckus
Roll quick and call my brothers
And I share my hoes, don't love em
I got money on my mind
I collect stacks and dimes
Give both at the same time
Next we go if you think I'm lyin
I'm getting BDS from 2 bitches
Predator O got new bitches
If I miss em I got new pictures
Niggas mad I done hit they sisters
Porn name â€“ Wiles Doby
Fuck a bitch, she owe me
Everywhere I go they know me
You can't tell me shit, gotta show me

Better hide yo hoes or we splittin it
You boys be bout the sentiment
I'm here to make that quitter lit

[Chorus: x2]
Coming down, dance around
Fuckin hoes in every...
Grooving down, dance around
Fuckin hoes in every town

[Verse 2]
Young niggas get the most hoes
Young niggas get the most hoes
If the city was a high school
Baby young nigga right here fuck around with the most shows
Bobby get some foes but I'm on those
My brother AT put him on hoes
I tell my lil sis keep her door closed
And if a nigga knock get the 4-4, 4-4
But my old bitch frontin
Though the bitch can't get nothing
No dick from me
It's a bitch bring a friend and a friend
Bring a friend with a big rongue
Young nigga but the old one that fuck a young nigga like a old nigga then get some
Niggas say I'm fuckin all these bitches cause a nigga name
I was fuckin bitches when I flipped to her
When they touched me, she fuck she loved it
I fuck her on her honey moon, once at her wedding
Say it in a church that I got a confession
I fucked with yo friend right now, we textin
The preacher laughed, she start undressin
Then she said "this is what you call a blessing"
I hit er 2 times then I learned my lesson
If she give me up it ain't up for discussion

[Chorus: x2]
Coming down, dance around
Fuckin hoes in every...
Grooving down, dance around
Fuckin hoes in every town

[Verse 3]
Coming down, extra buts
A broke motherfucker can't say I mean nothing
Worth we all showin grill
It ain't a fuckin bitch ain't know it's precious
Thousand slow, time to go
Trippin loud smoke and poppin dough
Every other day I break a bitch
Then we met ya'll, she stopped and blow
You gots to know
This ain't too quick for a nigga like me
People aim with the dough to the VIP
In the back of the club tryin to invite me if I was a bitch
Get yo fuck on, you a nasty bitch
Get yo suck on
If you ain't fuckin with it then get the fuck off
But they throw some bands I'm a bus on a bad bitch
My worst chick might just keep me stayin
Your head spin but I can't stay off pace
I break em off and I tune rates
You cough em up, it's super safe
Bum ass nigga, get a cup spark ass nigga
Even when I fucked yo bitch
It ain't my fault I'm a super fine
Bring it from the MI crooked, wut you know bout this?

[Chorus: x2]
Coming down, dance around
Fuckin hoes in every...
Grooving down, dance around
Fuckin hoes in every town

[Verse 4]
Damn right that's how I'm feelin
So high I can look down and see all on my 100 story building
Cause I'm a playa, puff and smoke that good
With the 2-0 that's of my children
They be lookin in they spot, I'm like daddy you the man
Right back when I got my million
I tell my son don't trust these hoes
If you wash yo hands don't touch these hoes
Put big diamonds in yo mouth
My shit's so big I get tired when I brush these hoes
I'm a bad motherfucker
Plus I can make a bitch tuck when I touch er
Ain't no touchin if it ain't no rubber
I've got to be a playa brother
Bitch not yo nigga that it lover
Make this hoe get underneath and put the bottom of my new sack on top of er nostril
Be gentile when you eat my dick
If you bite my shit that'll make me hostile
And yea I got them D blocks, that's why they call me play the kids
PIMP, I ain't tryna date a bitch

[Chorus: x2]
Coming down, dance around
Fuckin hoes in every...
Grooving down, dance around
Fuckin hoes in every town
