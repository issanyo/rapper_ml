[Intro: Chayse]
GMB, GMB

[Chorus: Chayse]
You don't have to call nobody, I'm right here
And if they take you down, I'm riding with you
I'm right here
Who gon' run it like you? (Nobody)
Who gon' boss up like you? (Nobody)
Who keep it a hundred like you? (Nobody)
Yea, nobody, baby

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Erry boss need a boss-lady
Let's get together, live a boss-life, and have some babies
Them haters used to say you crazy
Now they seeing our life amazing, got 'em looking shady
Matching Mercedes, crib big as mine
Magic cartier bracelets, like thanks for staying
Dine trips to Paris, kept you covered in carats
They just embarrassed cause they man ain't got them livin' this lavish
Well-established, fucked up, nigga
Million miles, still dressin' like a drug dealer
When I club witcha, she know
When it's time to get right
It ain't enough' for me to clean up nice
Tell your girls go keep their advice
We good without 'em, let us live our life
Hol' up

[Chorus: Chayse]
You don't have to call nobody, I'm right here
And if they take you down, I'm riding with you
I'm right here
Who gon' run it like you? (Nobody)
Who gon' boss up like you? (Nobody)
Who keep it a hundred like you? (Nobody)
Yea, nobody, baby

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I know I wasn't her type, but I'm the type that'll change your life
You've been down, got stripes, put in work, deserve all this ice
Them red-bottoms, you got 'em
Chanel purses and Birken
My boss-lady for certain, makin' up for when I had you hurtin'
Workin' on getting better, finally gettin' our life together
Now we on new levels, matching rollies, bigger bezels
It's a incredible feelin', drop rolls, no ceilin'
In London, pound peelin' up in Harrods, no chillin'
Feelin' blessed, cause she don't bring me stress
She put a smile on my face and that pussy is the best (yes)
Feelin' blessed, cause she don't bring me stress (no)
She keep a smile on my face and her head-game the best
Thugger

[Chorus: Chayse]
You don't have to call nobody, I'm right here
And if they take you down, I'm riding with you
I'm right here
Who gon' run it like you? (Nobody)
Who gon' boss up like you? (Nobody)
Who keep it a hundred like you? (Nobody)
Yea, nobody, baby
