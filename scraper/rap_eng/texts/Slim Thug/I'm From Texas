[Trae: Screwed Intro]
Chyeah, know’m talm bout?
You ain’t shit if you ain’t screwed up, for real

[Verse 1: Trae & Z-Ro]
[Z-Ro]
Houston, Texas, home of DJ Screw
We say know’m saying and what it do?
[Trae]
And if a nigga don’t like it, tell them bitches I rep Texas
Topless, in the slab I come thru
[Z-Ro]
Elbow and Vogues and expensive clothes
Candy paint car our cars, big booties on our hoes
[Trae]
Got diamonds in our mouth, still represent the south
Pull the truck up bitch, I’m swanging four’s
[Z-Ro]
I sip codeine out the styrofoam, 27- 10 is the kinda grind on
[Trae & Z-Ro]
I ain’t ever love a bitch, so I’m riding alone
Prolly when them niggas ain’t on the kind of shine I’m on
[Z-Ro]
Big dully trucks with the big rims
And the Cadillac with the fifth wheel
[Trae]
We from the hood and we keep steel
If you try to jack them you’re gonna get killed
[Z-Ro]
I don’t wear my britches tight, I wear them loose
Active Athlete for all my footwear, homie I got too many shoes
[Trae & Z-Ro]
I’m the man in my city, tell them niggas I won’t lose
Cross that path, and my nigga Hawk, we still gon’ chunk the deuce

[Hook]
Find me in the hood, in the city that I claim
Moving slow, like the music that I bang, Screwed!, screwed up!
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas
Glass underneath, beatin’, beatin', my block
Pop, pop my trunk, chain fulla rocks
Bitch I’m from Texas yeah, bitch I’m from Texas
Bitch I’m from Texas yeah, bitch I’m from Texas

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
You can find me in H. o.u.s.t.o.n, ridin' in
Candy trim, on pokey rims
Wit a tien, an her friend
Trae the truth, ridin’ right behind
Two cups full and I’m on my grind
Talkin’ dine, respect my mind
I’ll show you boys how Texas get dine
Rolex time, top lift back
On my nuts, cuz I got that sack
Papered up to the roof, it stacked
Hoes wanna hate but it don’t mean jack
Wheres there’s money that’s where I’m at
That Texas grind, that’s all I know
Bangin’ screw and drankin’ Big Moe
Basically get that dough, bro

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
North side, where the boss ride
Every day I got play outside. Huh?
Leavin’ them haters mouth wide
Can't’ be denied when they see me slide
Through the hood like I live there
Shit I got a few cribs there
All my G’s still chill there
We barbecuing’ them ribs there huh? What?
Smoke blunts and sip punch like its lunch
Every day we do it
Listenin’ to nothin but Texas music
Perfect match for that good fluid
Find me in the hood, in the city I claim
Everybody dine in H- town know me mayne

[Verse 4: Kirko Bangz]
Uhh, I gotta bad azz bitch, parked outside
Yella diamond my wrist, if it’s dark outside
Pull a lil’ bitch then I catch ghost
Justa lil’ kid from the ghetto
Never had shit but I got a lil’ bit
When I got a couple hits under this belt
Throw a H up, nigga, I ain’t tryna belch or nothin’
Ain't got a whole lotta money but I'm wealthy money
I sip a whole lottta drank but I'm healthy mami
Daddy was cool, but he couldn’t really tell me nothin’… uhh!
Everybody think a nigga lucked up
Young kirko, he done blew up
From the H- town, Nigga what’s up?

[Verse 5: Bun B]
I’m Port Author, Texas, let’s get that straight off the top
That’s where the hustlin’ and grindin’ and the hatin’ don’t stop
From the west side to east, we out here duckin’ them cops
And coming dine, candy paint, on them mother fuckin’ chops
It’s the land of the trill, that’s where the whole thang came from
And it just a word, or where a rapper get his name from
It’s a way of life, and we live to the fullest
For years, we represent, with it blood sweat and bullets
Ho, I’m from Texas!

Find me in the hood, in the city that I claim
Moving slow, like the music that I bang, Screwed!, screwed up!
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas
