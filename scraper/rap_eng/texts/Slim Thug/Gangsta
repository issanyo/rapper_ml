Gangsta from my head to my shoes

Ain't too many players that played the game like I do

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Huh, that's right my nigga money, hoes, cars, clothes
I think I fell in love with clothes and cars and doe
I know y'all don't be seeing me at award shows
Fuck going commercial real nigga, y'all know how it goes
Thousand dollar bottle of camante y'all know how it flows
I die once, a thousand times that's how a coward goes
You don't want none of me nigga I got power blow
Hoes as big as tennis balls that's all a Sig Sauer knows
Attitude like Pimp C, cup taste like Big Moe
R.I.P. to Pat and for the Hawk, that's my big bro
Every CD in my car say "DJ Screw"
If you from Houston and you rap my nigga he made you
I keep pens and pencils like bitches I pimp them hoes
Get it out of cock, put it in my socks it's what I do with the doe
Money ain't never been mad at me I stay cool with the doe
Like a dummy when he peeing I'm a fool with the flow

[Hook: Z-Ro]

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
Hah, I can't stop I gotta make my nigga Pimp proud (R.I.P.)

Don't know how to act, we goin fuck the club up (club up)
We just like em so the gangstas niggas love us (cheah)
