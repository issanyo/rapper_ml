You need to stop playing 'round with all them clowns and the wankstas
Good girls gotta get down with the gangstas
Go 'head, girl, put some back and some neck up on it
While I stand up in the background and check up on it

[Chorus]
Ooo, boy, you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it? I'm gon' let you work up on it
Ladies, let 'em check up on it; watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

If you got it, flaunt it; boy, I know you want it
While I turn around, you watch me check up on it
Ooo, you watchin' me shake it; I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it; it's blazin'; you watch me in amazement
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it
If you don't go braggin', I'm-a let you have it
You think that I'm teasin', but I ain't got no reason
I'm sure that I can please ya, but first I gotta read you

[Chorus x2]
I can tell you wanna taste it, but I'm gone make you chase it
You got to be patient; I like my men patient
More patience you'll take might get you in more places
You can't be abrasive; have to know to pace it
If I let you get up on it (you gotta make a promise)
That you gon' put it on me like no one's put it on me
Don't bore me; just show me; all men talk, but don't please
I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you

[Chorus x2]
Well, it's the king of the underground and the king of the trill
Standin' on the top of the soft like the king of the hill
You tuned into a winner that's never taken a loss
Reppin' music with Beyonce and Slim Thug the boss
Diamonds on the wood wheel; I'm a Dirty South soldier
Draped up in (?) Holder; thought I told you
I like your wiggle and the way that you work it
But no judging, just watchin' you twerk it; I'm checkin' up on you tonight

[Chorus x4]
