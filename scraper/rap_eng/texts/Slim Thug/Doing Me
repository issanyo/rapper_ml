(Thugga, Uh)

[Verse One: Slim Thug]

My trunk beating like a motherfucker
My trunk beating like a motherfucker
I'm just doing me, ain't like you other suckers
I'm just doing me, ain't like you other suckers

Pulling up in something, thought I spent about a hundred
I be pulling up it's so sunny, keep a car full of snow bunnies
Got it jumping like a bunny, this money coming so fast
I be hitting the block they watching, might drop top [?]
Might hop in that Hellcat, smash that gas, ain't gon' stop
Pull up and drop bags on that Harley fresh out the shop
How long a nigga gon' chill, see these laws all in the rearview
Still got that loud lit, and my bass loud I can't hear you
Never wanna be near you nigga, please give me my space
I don' set me mind that these niggas just gon' hate
I'ma always be a playa, I'ma always on grind
I'ma always be a hustler, always putting trill shit down
Never 'for my time, that's just what a real nigga do
I be coming down on shine, still hold it down for my crew
(Boss Hogg)
I be showing boys out of town how we roll and look clean
Nigga's stay talking [?] but them niggas can't fuck with me
(Uh uh uh)
Can't fuck with me, they can't fuck with me
I got this shit on lock its in my custody
None of these weirdos can fuck with me
None of these fake niggas can fuck with me
They can't fuck with me
They can't fuck with me
I got this shit on lock its in my custody
None of these weirdos can fuck with me
None of these fake niggas can fuck with me
Big boss on the block I'm an OG
And everywhere you go these hoes know me
Still collecting checks from my oldies
And I still kept m first 'Rollies
Pull up in something that you never saw
Everyday I wake up I gotta pick a car
You a switch up broad, switch up cars, switch up toys
Let them boys know that the boss is still going hard
Never ever ever did I quit
(Never)
I'll still take a nigga's bad bitch
Still never ever ever trip
(Never)
You know why? Because I'm from Texas bitch
Niggas need to wake up and smell this coffee
I be hitting the block till I [?]
Busting rubber bands man we do this often
It's fucked up I'm a rapper, I don't like talking
But [?] nigga like me, love to shine
I said fuck being broke, went, got my dollar signs
Puffing pine, off the mind, when I rhyme its Thugga-Einstein
Coming down
