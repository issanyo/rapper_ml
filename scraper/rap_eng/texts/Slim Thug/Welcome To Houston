(slim thug)
Now welcome to the city of game
Piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk n bang
Yeh im still here mayne
Born and raised of the stead block
Braise no dreadlocks
Married to the hood
Me and sunnywood wedlock
Haters home a home
Im an northside veteran
Repping h-town
Smoking, sippin on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when i floss
Its slim thugga mothafucker
Still breaking boys off

(chamillionaire)
Got plenty ???? plenty carats
Man we lookin like some caterers
And its looking like you haters and you fakes is imitatin us
Shaded up, braided up, and i bet that trunk be bladed up
Bentley still crawlin on fo's
So they ain't fading us
In the hood im a grinda
Wood on the vinyl
Tv, vcr, im layed back wit cha mama
You ain't never seen a grinda
That grind the way i grind, huh?
Top on my drop ???????????????

(chorus)
(still breakin boys off, hmmmm)
Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but thats the waya playa floss
(still breaking boys off, hmmmm)
Getting moneys what im bout
Ima get it while these haters just talk
(still breaking boys off, hmmmm)
Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(still breaking boys off, boys off
Still breaking boys off
And when i do it ima do it like a boss
(still breakin boys off)

(mike jones)
I still represent h-town
The city of that candy
They see me with a lotta cars
But they dont understand it
They say the never seen ya boy
Out here gettin his grind on
Platinum bentley ?????
Piggy ima get my shine on
Ive sold 2 million revcords
Now my paper all swole now

The mayor of the city
Top down when i roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and 4's

(bun-b)
Yeh this the city thats slow
The city thats thowed
The city where the boys
Flip the candy painted low
The city where they ?????
Hustling ass d boys
Got the game sold
And sip that paint (sip that paint)
And drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top)
And grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, i-10, 59, 45, and da belt
This clutch city
But we play wat we delt
Reppin da h-town

(chorus)
(still breakin boys off, hmmmm)
Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but thats the waya playa floss
(still breaking boys off, hmmmm)
Getting moneys what im bout
Ima get it while these haters just talk
(still breaking boys off, hmmmm)
Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(still breaking boys off, boys off
Still breaking boys off
And when i do it ima do it like a boss
(still breakin boys off)

(paul wall)
Houston towns my home
Its where i do my dirt
Where the gangtstas smoke water
Wit drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin
Chops blaze
Just to break boys off
From south park to the south west
And all the way to dat north
Im talking tentwheel, and carverdale, and greenspoint too
From denver harbour, to west airport
And all the way to channelview
We steady bangin on this screw
Its chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2
Its paul wall wat it do
