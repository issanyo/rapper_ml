[Intro]
Dawg, I went from tipping on 4's to buying my ten rows
But what's next?
I done saw the finest ho's around this globe without they clothes
But what's next?
Went from apartments in the hood to a mansion, living good
But what's next?
(stop me when I start lying though)
Went from the bottom to the top and I stil ain't gonna stop
So what's next

[Verse 1]
I'm trying to figure it out fast
New ways to keep my hands on some cash
Shit it ain't in my genes to sit up on my ass
I gotta get out on my grind to smash
People say I say that shit a lot (I know)
'cause that's all I'm 'bout
Fuck sitting at the crib, broke in the same spot
Getting high 'til the day you die
'cause when I'm getting high
I'm celebrating this new paper I made (yeah)
That's why
NIgga
I ain't just speaking not doing shit
And if I'm smoking I'm in the studio, doing this
This buy me Benz so it's still my lick
First one in the city with it like always trick
Bitch
What's next

[Chorus]
I done probably messed around with the baddest ones in town
But what's next?
I done popped Cris, Rose, Ace of Spades by the load
But what's next?
I done bought too many Rollies, AP's, Bentley B's
But what's next
(we been doing that shit since the smiley faces)
I done been around so long, and the money still ain't gone

[Verse 2]
I'm talking bonds and stocks, now we out filling blocks
Still climbing to the top
What? They thought I'm gonna stop?
Always on my next hustle
Always chasing that green
Always kept the cleanest cars and baddest broads on the scene
If I offend you, I'm sorry
I fell in love with flexing
My diamond chains got a lot of you boys shopping in Texas
From the bottom, still climbing, so you know how that feels
To be the boss in the game and still survive without a record deal
Still finding new ways to get this money up
Left and let the dummies who are out here hustle us (ha)
'cause I'm still climbing high, they in the same place they was
Ten years ago, damn time flies (time flies)

[Chorus]
I done put so many ho's in them slabs in the folds
But what's next?
I done rocked Versace clothes, Hermes to the floor
But what's next?
Thugga always stay trill, had big diamonds in my grill
But what's next?
I rock that North side with pride, gonna keep it trill
'til I die
But what's next?
(What's next)
(What's next)
(What's next)
