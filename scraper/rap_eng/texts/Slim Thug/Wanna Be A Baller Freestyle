I'm finally getting what's mine
From being out on the grind
It's Slim Thug time to shine in nineteen ninety nine
I'm still behind the ballar best when I drank I smoke
I wanna float over seas in a candy coat boat
Six TVs with remote me and my two nephews
Acting fools looking cool
Watching the Blues Clues
My bezel seen with the cross
The big boss I floss
When I open up my mouth
I rep the north and the the south
See I'm headed to The Kappa
On fo' swangas and the dappas
And I'm the hating ho slappa'
And flow pro rapper
It's the Mister Slim Thug
Straight about the stead
Watch me pop the trunk drop and the top and turn some heads
I can weigh the flat bed
On my off the mic trophy
Make my Vouges smokey if a fat ho approach me
I'mma let my trunk dance
And my fifth deep wheel sleep
About twenty slabs deep
Blow a Swish on beat
I'm a creep
And that boy crawl
Watch me ball up and down the sea wall
Standing six six tall so you couldn't miss me
And I'mma talk down
On every single ho that dis me
I done shined up the gold grin
Me and and all my friends
Them fell in about ten at the Victorian Inn
Freshly pressed in my Guess
I got the "S" on my chest
I sip the drank and smoke the cess
To release all stress
Gucci shades on my braids
Gotta stay playa made
Getting paid and getting laid
I parked the drop in the shade
I'm Polo from head to toe when I open my do'
Smell like fresh Optimo straight out the Stop'n'Go sto'
See I'm a ho that can flow
So bitch bob your head
I wreck the mic and make you hype
Until I'm dead or gone Fed
It's the Mister Slim Thug and I just can't quit
And I ain't broke it baby for my boy big pic
Only lock I ain't forgot about it rocking the drop
The Swishahouse done wreck shop
And got chopped by the Watts
See I'm squashing all chatter cause it really don't matter
You can see me on TV with that boy Mad Hatter
At the Kappa
On the damn mission
Might flip the Linc or the big Expedition
My diamonds gon' glisten
From the beam of the sun
I wanted to be a baller
Since I first turned one
Call me the top gun
You can call me fresh
But I won't rest till I get call the best
I'll make you say oh yes
That boy's a clown
I'mma show surround when I hit the chocolate town
Watch me put it down
For the side that I claim
Ride swanging paint squeezing chains pinky rang
Like leo I go fo I'ma, I'ma brake them boys off
To remain to gain fame for my dawgs out the north
