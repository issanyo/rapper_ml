[Verse 1:]
I grew up on that Northside
Where 1st 48 stay at
AKs spray at
We want that
We take that
Grieve ma niggas
Grey and Corn [?] where they lay at
Snitch bitches and snitch niggas
Must be thinking that we play that
Bitch we got your pictures
Can’t wait to get our payback
Catch you later slick
And guaranteed we going spray that
Take away my partners
We like brothers
We go way back
Had to sign for Ten
Can’t see their sons turn to men
Niggas really 100
Till they catch their first case
Turn bitch
Start talking
Before they step on first base
(bitch niggas)
No mo’ codes
These niggas is hoes
Telling the people shit
They ain’t even asked for
[?] son’s at his games
No more daddy
Daughter’s birthday just passed
No more daddy
Gotta sign for ten
Try minimum 25
Not knowing if I see em
Free again, alive
Man that’s fucked up
I hope all ya’ll die
I know that’s fucked up
But I hope all ya’ll die
Ya’ll fucked up
And got caught
Should have kept ya’ll head up
Imma send them killaz your way
And let that lead lift ya’ll head up
Nigga

[Chorus:]
Until the day I’m gone
Imma be a real nigga
(100)
And if you ain’t a real nigga
I can’t even deal witchu
(I can’t fuck witchu man)
A nigga’s 5k1
I seen your paperwork nigga
(I seen your paperwork nigga)
So when I catch ya’ll in the streets
It’s RIP to ya’ll niggas
Out of sight

[Verse 2:]
Get out the game
If you can’t take your charge
This game ain’t for the weak
Ya’ll fucking up the odds
E’erybody tell it
But e’erybody sellin
Go get a job pussy
If you scared to be a felon
That’s a chance you take
For this money you make
Was in the free world stuntin
Big crib on the lake
Ya’ll get money made you real
You niggas real fake
Wish ma partners would have listened
When we told em you was fake
Free Jimbo, Lee Gray, Owl
And the [?]
Q H-Town hustlers
Tryna get that bread
All my hustlers in the game
I know they got you scared
These niggas working with the people
This game so evil
Ma niggas ain’t killed nobody
They just tryna feed they fam
They tryna give them life
For just moving them grams
Movin them birds
Wanting a better life
All I can do is pray
Have mercy Jesus Christ

[Chorus]
