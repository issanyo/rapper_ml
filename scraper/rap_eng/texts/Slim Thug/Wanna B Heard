[VERSE 1: BOOSIE BADAZZ]
2 hits of tha weed as they clutch Glocks
Hennessy up in me at tha bus stop
See tha cops hit tha curb
We would buss out
My lil' nigga shootin' guns, he a thug now
We done lost a real nigga so it's blood clot
Slang that bitch like Ox if I got to
I ain't pussy, I'll prove it to you one thang
Want a body so you know I'm shootin' point blank
That's gon' make him think twice 'fo he try me
Is this any way to think for somebody
I'm bodied, you bodied
I shoot it too
Where I'm from, they don't give tha youth nuthin' to do

[HOOK]
Thuggin' on tha block
Poppin' shots
GOD forgive 'em
They just wanna b heard
They just wanna b heard

Thuggin' on tha block
Poppin' shots
They ain't crazy
They just wanna b heard
They just wanna b heard

[VERSE 2: SLIM THUG]
Lord forgive these young hustlers out here drug dealing
They just tired of being broke
Tryna see a million
Pack a pistol
But ain't tryna do no killin'
But these other niggas starvin' and they like stealin'
Can't have no feelings in ya DNA
They'll call ya soft
When ya soft, everythang you got come up lost
They feelin' like tha streets tha only way out
Minimum wage ain't enough when them J's out
They just tryna b heard
Pull up clean, piece and chain
Rollie, sippin' syrup
Ghetto dreams tired of chasin' round fiends
Tryna show up like a boss
And put on fa tha team
Thugga

[HOOK]
Thuggin' on tha block
Poppin' shots
GOD forgive 'em
They just wanna b heard
They just wanna b heard

Thuggin' on tha block
Poppin' shots
They ain't crazy
They just wanna b heard
They just wanna b heard

[VERSE 2: BOOSIE BADAZZ]
If we don't tell 'em not a word
If we don't tell 'em bout Screw
They gon' sip syrup
Teenager when she touched tha block
They ain't pay her no attention so she fucked tha block
She just wanted to b heard
Ain't like to crush a lot
Caught a disease in tha end cause she fucked a lot
I could have told her Hi
But I told her Bye (straight up)
Told her I was coming back but told a lie
Saw Glen had sumin' on his mind
I shoulda asked him what's wrong
Probably woulda told me before he blasted his dome
Saw Titus paint every thang red bitch see me
My dawg up tha road but a nigga still eatin'
He wanna b heard

[HOOK]
Thuggin' on tha block
Poppin' shots
GOD forgive 'em
They just wanna b heard
They just wanna b heard

Thuggin' on tha block
Poppin' shots
They ain't crazy
They just wanna b heard
They just wanna b heard
