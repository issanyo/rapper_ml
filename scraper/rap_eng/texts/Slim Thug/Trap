[Verse 1]
I thank God that I made it out the trap
Thank God I made it out the trap and made a couple mill with this rap
Could have been behind the strap yelling freeze, give up your keys
Tell your bitch get on her knees before this trigger squeeze
Still G's but we mo' on the hustler side
Main focus is the money not you other guys
Too wise to do dumb shit and get locked up
I filed for and wrote this business trying to get knocked up
I got my stocks up
Stop spending, start stacking
Stay focused on my grind and look what happened?
Lost a lot of friends
Chasing them ends but that's life
Can't take everybody with you when you take flight
Some niggas won't act right no matter how you feed them
And if somebody hold me back
Fuck 'em, I don't need 'em
That's my motto or else wait around on the lotto
Went and got my life
Fuck it

[Chorus]
Can't believe I made it out
I made it out the trap
I really used to hustle on the block
A couple homies gone and they
Ain't never coming back
I thank God that I made it out the trap
Yeah, I thank God that I made it
Out the trap

[Verse 2]
Old man got ghosts on us
Watch out as crooked cops plant dope on us
And you know they got their scope on us
Mad 'cause all they bitches want us
Fear's how to spot conspiracies
Can't stand to see a black man get cheese
Don't nobody got degrees but be rolling Benz
Big TV's you can see the money rolling in
Then the pins come mixed up is why I call it trap
Had to switch it up and get rich with the rap
Used to have dreams of a thousand keys
But ended up fighting felonies

[Chorus]
Can't believe I made it out
I made it out the trap
I really used to hustle on the block
A couple homies gone and they
Ain't never coming back
I thank God that I made it out the trap
Yeah, I thank God that I made it
Out the trap
I thank God that I made it out the trap
I made it out
I made it
I thank God that I made it out the trap
