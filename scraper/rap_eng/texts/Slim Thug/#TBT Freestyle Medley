Now look who creepin', look who crawlin'
Look who ballin' in the mix
It's the 6'6" long dick Slim nigga
Who be stickin' your chick
These niggas watch me, Loc'd in Versace
With an AX on my chest
Big boss belt buckle
Holdin' down my [?]
When Slim Thug ball in the club
I'm guaranteed to turn heads
This is how I act in the droptop
Tell these hoes I'm [?]
Swishahouse gettin' [?]
At all times when I'm flippin'
I'm grain-grippin', smokin', dippin'
Still syrup pint sippin'
I'm still tippin' on fo-fours
Wrapped in four fours
Pimpin' four hoes
And I'm packin' four fours
Wavin' 'em out the window
Playin' my '64 Nintendo
[?] bricks hittin' links
And I'm tinted up in a Pinto
Niggas don't understand me
Cause I'm [?]
Sippin' on [?] and brandy
With a big Glock 9, handy
Flossin' up your streets, taking your beat with all of my beef
Hoes drop when they see Slim
In the wooden carseat
Makin' hoes [?]
My [?]
It'll take you three days
To count all the rocks in the rings on my pinkies
Stand down with H-Town 'til the day that I'm dead
It's too much money, weed and pussy
And my life off of the stage
Got bad kids, bad bets and bad stacks of the cash
Got a youngster lookin' good when I glide  on the class
Versace shades holding my braids when I rollerblade
Gotta stay paid, [?] bank don't have a K
Tossed up Tidwell, whip grain on grain
Hopped up [?]
I'm havin' fun off [?]
Turnin' heads on Homestead
