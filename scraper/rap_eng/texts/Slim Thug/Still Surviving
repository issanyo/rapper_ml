[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
If you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you
If you don't ride for me, bitch I ain't gon' ride for you
All exchange, no robberies in my life
Mad niggas get the livings life right
Reach for my phone, guess what i see
Haters talking down already bitch I'm still sleepy
Why you thinking bout me early in the morning
Waking up hating ain't even finished on it
Is it cause a nigga still surviving
Cause I'm still getting mine is that's suprising
I been doing this shit for a long time
You niggas just be rapping ain't get [?]

[Hook: Slim Thug]
I'm still surviving
I'm still surviving
Never apologizing
Cause bitch I'm still surviving
I'm still surviving
Where my hunnid ground highs mane
I'm still surviving

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Pop, poppin' out 5 hunna thousand dollar rolls
Taking a bitch shit
Left the damn mall, and they already know
Ah shit there the thugga go
They say I kept to much
Same bitch niggas say I rap too much
How the hell you hate a hustler
Broke niggas you ain't even my customers
Mind yo mofucking business, I'm bossed up, I'm boss living
She-a give me head until the top
Pussy niggas you just mad that I took yo dog

[Hook: Slim Thug]
I'm still surviving

Never apologizing
Cause bitch I'm still surviving
I'm still surviving
Where my hunnid ground highs mane
I'm still surviving

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
All life, all life, this shit don't stop
Looking at what they pulling up in that big drop
At the top back looking like a superstar
2 dimes with me bout to pull a menage a trois
No broad, no panties in my ride
Respect the dress code when you get inside
I'm alive, I'm alive, I know plenty that died
Or got locked up that's fucked up for jus' tryna survive
Still jumping on them bitches like the Sauce Twins
You on the Bentley or the Benz [?] who win
[?]
We gon' live life right
Stay high as a kite, pull every dime in my sight

[Hook: Slim Thug]
I'm still surviving
I'm still surviving
Never apologizing
Cause bitch I'm still surviving
I'm still surviving
Where my hunnid ground highs mane
I'm still surviving
