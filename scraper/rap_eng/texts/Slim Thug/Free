P-p-playin' still
Thugga

(I wanna be free)
I don't need a lover, I don't need a family
I don't need a ball and chain here keepin' me
I don't need a bride time, no wide valentine
I don't need a heart that's stringin' me worldwide

I wanna be free fallin', free ballin'
On the top of the city lights callin'
Don't feel sorry for me 'cause I wanna be free
I wanna be free
(I wanna be free, I wanna be free)

No marriage for me, I'm cool
To give a single life up, I be a fool
Party all night, sleep all day
Pack up and go when I wanna get away

This week N.Y., next L.A
Then in Miami just to see the heat play
Settlin' down now nope not in my world
Why pick when I get all the pretty girls?

I wanna be free and just do me
Welcome to the thug show, it's a movie
A lot of groupies, late nights and fun times
No need to worry, I'll be fine

I don't need a lover, I don't need a family
I don't need a ball and chain here keepin' me
I don't need a bride time, no wide valentine
I don't need a heart that's stringin' me worldwide

I wanna be free fallin', free ballin'
On the top of the city lights callin'
Don't feel sorry for me 'cause I wanna be free
I wanna be free
(I wanna be free, I gotta be free)

It's peace and quit when I wake up
House clean, no girl clothes or make-up
Smoke what I want, turn the music bass up
Oh, you tired, let me call another date up

Why you mad at me, baby, I ain't your man
I'm what they call your homie lover friend
Late night hype when you feelin' lonely
But you never ever be the one and only

I'm gone all the time, too focused on my grind
To be on the road with your home on my mind
I live a life that ain't right for a wife
Too much temptation out here every night

I don't need a lover, I don't need a family
I don't need a ball and chain here keepin' me
I don't need a bride time, no wide valentine
I don't need a heart that's stringin' me worldwide

I wanna be free fallin', free ballin'
On the top of the city lights callin'
Don't feel sorry for me 'cause I wanna be free
I wanna be free
(I wanna be free, I wanna be free)

I do what I wanna do when I want to
See who I wanna see when I want to
Be where I wanna be when I want to
'Cause I'm free to do whatever I wanna do

And it feel good, yeah, real good
No stress from my ex no more
I'm in the cool top, downright solo
And I won't get locked down no more

I don't need a lover, I don't need a family
I don't need a ball and chain here keepin' me
I don't need a bride time, no wide valentine
I don't need a heart that's stringin' me worldwide

I wanna be free fallin', free ballin'
On the top of the city lights callin'
Don't feel sorry for me 'cause I wanna be free
I wanna be free
(I wanna be free, I wanna be free)

I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
