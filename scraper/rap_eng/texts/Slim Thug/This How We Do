Doing it up with Mr. Lee, Nodd Factor, CMG

No tricking, what, this how we do it mayn, 2003

[Slim Thug]
I'm relaxing on the seven day, Carnival Cruise mayn just
Living the lifestyle, of the rich and the famous
Sipping margarita mix, with one of my model chicks
She's a hottie perfect body, 36-24-36
It's a beautiful thang
And on the cool, I ain't got room to complian
I'm living lovely drinking bubbly, on all occasions
Over a million bucks, is what my jewelry appraising
Black, White or Asian the girl is mine
I'm knocking down, one of Steve Frances hoes right now
I'm a balla taller, than Jailon Rose
Don't shoot basketball, but I play with the pros
A six figga nigga, who pockets keep getting bigger
Trying to rape the industry, like Dame Dash and Jigga
Jeah I'm truly blessed, by the man up above
And he showing nothing but love, for his son Slim Thug

We bout to say what's up Northside
Come on, this how we do it on the Southside
That's right, we bout to dip on through the Eastside
Fa sho, they throw the dub up on the Westside
Ok, they get they money on the Northside
Come on, we do it big on the Southside
That's right, they keep it fly on the Eastside
Fa sho, they smoke the best on the Westside, ok ok

[Lil' Keke]
Here comes a superstar, laid back and confidential
Got double platinum potential, and birds off in the rental
It's just fundamental, how the game is applied
I get a gangsta stay thugging, for my niggas that died
So let me take a ride, stroll up memory lane
You get your two for one twenty, for a show ain't a thang
You know it's Southsive, that's how the money divide
Got leather and plenty wood, plus the body is wide
So throw your home up, baby we done blown up
Rolling on 22's, transportation gotta be grown up
Niggas better own up, when it's time for war
Get to' up be coming down, and I be sitting at the bar
With your sugar brown yellow bone, something I can take home
Got her in a thug zone, so I mash on
Floss mode, when the mix is thick
Throw your deuce up quick, I'm bout to crash your chick

[Late Nite]
It's the Boss of the North, the Don of the South
A beautiful day, to pull the toys out
Living lovely, why would you wanna hate me
It's the Boss of the North, the Don of the South
A beautiful day, to pull the toys out
Living lovely, why would you wanna hate me

[Hook - 2x]
