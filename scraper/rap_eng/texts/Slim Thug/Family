[Verse 1]
Niggas be screaming Lord to me and don’t even know what it means
You we ain’t friends we are family stick together at all times God knows
I’m going to hold my naggas down all came from the ground up
Had it rough now we bosses
Went from selling bricks to selling brick houses
Had to take a lot of house but we still standing strong
I can’t wait until my brothers and the feds come home
Trying to do my niggas wrong shout town we miss you
Every time we fuck the city up
We gonna see some bitches but it will never be the same
Without ya man I swear fuck new friends these bunch of new niggas
Ain’t playing fair same niggas that help you
The same niggas want to rob you
Niggas act like hoes too many without no fathers
Nobody to teach them what being real means
Nobody to teach them how to build a team
And go out and live their dreams
A Lot of niggas got no self esteem quick to say fuck you
And fuck their lives up like we ain’t friends
Family stick together all the time lord knows
I’m a hold my niggas down I came from the ground up
Had it rough now we bosses selling bricks to selling brick houses

[Hook]
We ain’t friends we family and should stick together all times
Lord knows I’m a hold my niggas down we all came from the ground up
Had it rough now we bosses selling bricks to selling brick houses

[Verse 2]
Blood make you king lord to make you family
Me and my niggas been down from day one like family
I seen my nigga dre in years it’s all fucked up
You see my face when it’s time to roll up
Try to get your hustle up and took a wrong turn
They told on my nigga that’s a slow burn
Snitches you’ll get your own tuen
Ten years just for staying real
Still keeping your head up like it’s no big deal
Only a few real walking into this world
So when you walk out it will be one more
It’s your bro so by the time you make it home
We can put you on put you on the right track
Let’s go and get your money

[Hook]
We ain’t friends we family and should stick together all times
Lord knows I’m a hold my niggas down we all came from the ground up
Had it rough now we bosses selling bricks to selling brick houses
We ain’t friends we family and should stick together all times
Lord knows I’m a hold my niggas down we all came from the ground up
Had it rough now we bosses selling bricks to selling brick houses
We ain’t friends we family
