Hook:
Loving you is cool
But getting money is the only thing that’s on my mind
I don’t know what to do but hustle
I’d be living on the street if I’m not on my grind!
I’m doing the best I can, I need you to understand
To be on my side!
It’s a hell of sacrifice, I’m chasing this cash for life
It’s a long, long ride!

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
It’s a long ride, a lot of lonely nights
Might be a lot of fuck up 'fore I finally get it right
Shit, I hope I’m worth it, cause Shit, you ain’t perfect
All them Gucci and Louis purses, I hope you deserved it!
Stay down, only weak bitches lay down
We can’t afford to just walk away from this pay now
I’m shipping shit through Greyhound taking all kinds of chance
To be locked up, but you rocked up living in many mansions!
Hog Life gotta get it if it’s good
Niggas who get lazy end up back in the hood
If I lost it all, I probably lose you
So if it’s paper on the table, I can’t chose you!

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Oh, if my pockets on flat, I can’t enjoy you, baby
Doing anything without money to me, it’s just annoying, baby!
I know you love looking at that satellite TV
Them other niggas shit off, you’ll have to look at them DVDs
Bitch I ain’t trying to hold your hand and take a walk in the park
I rather get my hustle on, so we don’t have to talk in the dark
And fuck a repo I ain’t give up my Bentley like that
I’ll be got damn if I let the recession, pin me like that
If I go to jail is bail money
It’s your red bottom, it’s Channel money
Plus the mortgage, fuck motel money
You smell good, but i’d rather smell money!
I-10 is a football field, and I swear I’mma running back
So sit the fuck down and wait for me to come back with that money, babe!

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Uh, I don’t wanna be just news, baby
I wanna be the hot topic
Eat lobster everyday of my life, what the hell is a hot pocket
Catch your case is all good, I had to… now I got to drop it
Come home, keep fucking you until you say
‘Z-Ro, you got to stop it!’
When I’m done I’m back, I’m back, I’m back, right back on my grind
Like YZ I got racks on racks on racks right back on my mind
You’re living lavish, you love that shit
Cause you was broke before, you broke that dick
So I hope you learned how to love that brick
Cause without that bitch we wouldn’t be shit!

[Verse 4: Slim Thug]
Shit, without these licks you wouldn’t be shit, no red bottoms
Bragging to your friend about how you got them
Every pair every time they spot ‘em
Taking trips, first class flight
It’s getting hard, but I love my life
I’mma make sure my money right
Grind all day and I grind all night
Like drive around in foreigns and vacate when it’s boring
Town to town like in touring sipping on drink till you see me snoring
I sleep good, since I’m out the hood
I eat good in these streets, streets
So I’m gonna get this paper, I’ll be back next week! Bye!
