[Intro: Paul Wall]
J season
We work for what we got
No free handouts over here baby
Gotta get it

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
I’m crawlin Don Sheppard, drive slow
I’m spotted like a leopard, here I go
H-Town repper, on the floor
Used to get drinks from eckers
But that was a long time ago
Grind mode, I’m working in the paint like Kendrick purple
Wood wheelin I’m workin, yea them red lights I’m merkin
Double cup, I’m surfin, yea that Cadillac’s got curtains in it
It is gon be hurtin when they see the top convertin
They still hatin on me, I guess it’s motivatin they life
Leanin off that ace, posted up, know it’s on time
The best things are free, only broke people say that
I’ve been putting in work and getting money since way back
You know what I’m drinkin, good kush got me thinkin
Side mirrors breakin while that 5th wheel plankin
Big bug bankin, going HAM for the vital
Getting money til I’m more than mike
And I can give a fvck what you think

[Hook: Paul Wall]
Only broke motherf*ckers got time to hate
Cuz all the moneymakers too busy getting paid
I’m too busy getting paid
I’m too busy getting paid
Only lazy motherf*ckers got time to hate
Cuz all the moneymakers too busy getting paid
I’m too busy getting paid
I’m too busy getting paid

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I’m too busy getting money to worry bout them problems
Just gotta think I’m Johnny and them diamonds lookin sunny
I can’t even see a hater, to me they don’t exist
I’m busy countin paper, that’s why them haters pissed
But I made it living major, they ain’t makin shit
It’s like 15 years later I’m still making hits
Number one to your bitch, that’s why they talkin down
I’m so rootin flow Slim when you see me ridin
Smellin like a pound of that Cali kush bud
Million dollar nigga and I still stay thug
I ain’t fvckin with no scrubs, they rub off on ya
I’m grindin with the hustlers, fvck chillin on them corners
