[Hook: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my Daddy
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Yeah uh huh, You tryna keep up with these bitch niggas
You gon’ fuck around and end up in your momma’s house
Why you listening to that loud ass bitch?
Nine times out of ten shawty don’t know what she talkin’ about
Spend this money like the money make itself
Told my girl bring her, what if she gon’ need help
I keep it pimpin’ V-12 engine, shawty so fly, I might fly out to Memphis
And let her meet the fam. sike, think again
I’m high off kush and flyer than Peter pan
These rappers ain’t real, they living in TV Land
And they don’t wanna grind, they just wanna be the man
Niggas want a slice of the pie, they reach their hand
But they ain’t even got enough to pay the pizza man
And everybody rapping about a check
Promise if you look closer, niggas really in debt
Back to back number one records
True shit, you ain’t ever seen it done better
Hundred racks each pocket, that’s a double decker
I just went and got my little college chick a kompressor
All this ice on me, never let them see me sweat
Watch your bitch strip naked for a VVS
These niggas mouth’s never close like CVS
And all these niggas rich, on the internet
That’s a rented car, and that’s a bone chain
Worldstar front page, now you got some fame
Juicy J, certified OG, with all this bread I got, who needs beef?
If you listen close, you can learn a lesson from me
Say my name nigga, you gon’ need protection from me
I’m in my loft, find me on the roof playing golf
I don’t take no days off, but every day I take off
Smoke some

[Hook: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my Daddy
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

[Hook: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my Daddy
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all

[Verse 3: Wacka Flocka]
Fuck shit God damn money
R-r-really need to recognize who you talking to
I get paid your yearly salary just to walk it through
Wonder why I stay grinning? Cuz a nigga stay winning
All them cars and the cribs, a home and they ain't rented
I should feel bad for 'em truthfully, this the motherfuckin rap game, who do you believe?
I told 'em when I started only option is shootin me, or salutin me, I'm still here and the crew with me
Cold day in hell before someone get the best of me
I be at the lake house, wildin' on some jet skis
Daddy back run along do your chores mane
Bricksquad Monopoly is not a fuckin' board game
I'm the only one that get the job done
I'm payin nobody, shoot my own gun
I'm the only one that get the job done

[Verse 4: Slim Thug]
Cause everything I say you see
Down in H Town in 3D
Ain’t nothing fake ‘bout a G
Said all I talk about is cars
My cribs and my ménages with broads
My bad, if all y’all frauds
I was tryna keep it real, man, fuck how you feel
Made a whole lot of money, got a lot more coming
Through messing with them bob swings, got me a
Woman
Old G in the game, still keep it one hundred
If I ain’t the best rapper, I’m the number one stunner
In my city
They try to act like they don’t see me but I be in they
Face like TV
Stay on the radio all day and all night
Man, ho, look, bring that back, be right
Slim Thug, flow tox, slow so you hear me
Underground boss, other rappers ain’t near me
Made it my career, yeah, I still say give me
Did it my way, still ain’t changed clearly
No stress, still blessed
Stepping out the crib, half a mil’ on my chest
You ain’t gotta like me but my momma still
Impressed
That I moves us out the hood and we ain’t moved
Back yet

{Outro: Drake]
Slim thug flow but u nuggin at the best
Slim thug flow but u nuggin at the best
Slim thug flow but u nuggin at the best
Slim thug flow but u nuggin at the best
Slim thug flow but u nuggin at the best
(till fade)
