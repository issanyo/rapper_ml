Slim Thug flow but you nuggin’ at the best

[Verse 1 : Slim Thug]
Believe me, it’s easy
‘Cause everything I say you see
Down in H Town in 3D
Ain’t nothing fake ‘bout a G
Said all I talk about is cars
My cribs and my ménages with broads
My bad, if all y’all frauds
I was tryna keep it real, man, fuck how you feel
Made a whole lot of money, got a lot more coming
Through messing with them bob swings, got me a
Woman
Old G in the game, still keep it one hundred
If I ain’t the best rapper, I’m the number one stunner
In my city
They try to act like they don’t see me but I be in they
Face like TV
Stay on the radio all day and all night
Man, ho, look, bring that back, be right
Slim Thug, flow tox, slow so you hear me
Underground boss, other rappers ain’t near me
Made it my career, yeah, I still say give me
Did it my way, still ain’t changed clearly
No stress, still blessed
Stepping out the crib, half a mil’ on my chest
You ain’t gotta like me but my momma still
Impressed
That I moves us out the hood and we ain’t moved
Back yet


Slim Thug flow but you nuggin’ at the best
