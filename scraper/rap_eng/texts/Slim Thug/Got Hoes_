[Verse 1:]
We got hoes (We got hoes) [x4]
Getting money but we want some more
Planting money but we want some more
Bad bitches got them watching
When we pull up top dropping
About to be stunting on the crowd
And we from there so we keep it long
If ever the H still making them proud
And if you want to hate you can get your ass out
You can get your ass wopped or you can get smashed out
And me and my niggers we dont pass out
Hey we about money getting doe
And that drop top getting blowed
When i pull up at your hoes
Cause when they see me they ready to go Eh eh eh oh no

[Hook:]
We got hoes (We got hoes) [x4]
Hoes in fours (Hoes in fours)
Plenty more (Plenty more)
Piece of rock they pineapple them eh eh eh
We got hoes (We got hoes) [x2]
And it's plenty
Plenty more
We ain't tripping with you bro
If you want to come for her just let a nigga know
Hey we got hoes and we players

[Verse 2:]
And we shine around the city like the mayor (fuck the mayor)
And we won't stop we keep on climbing
And them real niggers keep on vining
Cause we hustle and ain't quit
Since a long time we go about this shit
You boys know that thyme is bitch
I’ve been dropping hits since you were about 6
Hopped out the door I’m too cold
Get a bad bitch and get her to stay
To the hotel and get her to fuck
Facts change boo be both gonna bust eh eh eh

[Hook:]
We got hoes (We got hoes) [x4]
Hoes in fours (Hoes in fours)
Plenty more (Plenty more)
Piece of rock they pineapple them eh eh eh
We got hoes (We got hoes) [x2]
And it's plenty
Plenty more
We ain't tripping with you bro
If you want to come for her just let a nigga know
I know i’m your favorite
