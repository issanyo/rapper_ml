Ass so fat, pussy so wet
It's a work out baby let me see you sweat
Got her bustin' back to back like a new tec
Puttin in work like I'm try'na get a check
(2x)

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
First off, the boss
Freaks all the honeys
Stunning, playboy bunnies, those want money
Them's the ones I like cuz thats who I get paid with
She got a million dollar pussy, keep a player rich
Break a trick then make the trick make me rich
Them other niggas counterfit, Thugga real as it get
I keep mines in line, all equal to a dime
Once I hit it from behind like im try'na crack her spine, I ain't lyin'
We-we-we gon' bump and grind till I see her crying
I wana see ya shine so I wana see ya mine
Rhyme part time but this pimpin' shits my passion
She shakin' it, baby get ya cash then
Thugga!
