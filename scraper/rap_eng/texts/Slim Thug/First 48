Nigga what you scared for, I hear your heart beating
You pussies talkin all that shit you ain't talking no more cause the mothafuckin killas outside ya front door and it sound like (boom boom boom boom) you better pray nigga this the first 48 nigga
Nigga what you scared for, we hear your heart beating
You pussies talkin all that shit you ain't talkin no more cause the mothafuckin killas outside ya front door & it's all I eat
(boom boom boom boom) you better pray niggas first 48 niggas

First verse
Somebody call the laws, homicide division
This young nigga gone hope he had the lord with him
Way he was bumpin nigga shoulda had that pistol with him
Way he up on the other night aiming towards the ceilin'
He should've been a suspect, now his ass a victim
Everybody crying out terrorist so forgiving
I kept beating on his chest thought he was a ape
Now he looking like a gift wrapped in yellow tape
Yea its wrong but it's the way we play & that's the way we play, first 48
No trace So he bumped up to cold case, Boss nigga these streets wild nigga
Plus they ain't eatin so the crime rate increasing
I just got a call my nigga died this evening, tonight we riding, everybody silent
Somebody better pray, first 48 nigga

2nd verse
It's murder season nigga, you better be a shooter or be dead sleep ask Freddy Krueger
These boys tripping this shit so senseless niggas fallin like rain man
This game vicious
Swear to God man this ain't livin
Got a Christian smoking Sherm tryna lose his feeling
Got shot tryna turn the other cheek
He still God fearing but he roll with that heat
Now he bein smart smart guess he wanna live
Its real in the field cuz kill or be killed
I'm ridin with K the like I'm kin to Bin Laden
I'm all in the game & I ain't talkin bout Madden
I'm talkin bout war the whole fuckin niggas off
Pussy better shoot first, I ain't takin no loss
Ain't even been a year since my best friend wake
I retaliate, ask First 48 nigga

(chorus)

'Slim Thug'
Thugga
It's a wrap somebody say a prayer for him, notify his family, call someone who care for him
It was all good about an hour ago now this nigga laying lifeless out on the floor
Bet when he woke up this morning he ain't imagine that & when he left the house thought he'd be right back
Gave his girl a kiss told her he'd be out late
If she only knew they was on they last date
He hit the club Getting fucked up was the plan
Too many drinks had him feeling Like he superman
Pushin through the crowd talkin all loud and wreck-less, but ain't too many punks down here in Houston Texas
Ran into the wrong crew
He was like hol' up, slow your roll before you get yo ass swoll up
Reach for his heat but guess what you too late, there goes another candidate for First 48

You pussies talkin all that shit you ain't talkin no more cause the mothafuckin killas outside ya front door & it's all I eat
(boom boom boom boom) you better pray niggas first 48 niggas
