Nigga it's real

Hey

Hey, Hey
Nigga it's real
I don't give a fuck how you feel
Hey
I ain't ready to chill
I ain't tripping nigga this how I live
Hey, Hey

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]

I gotta be that's why they called me
To hop up on the song, must've thought of me
Cause Thugga keep it trill, Thugga been real
Since the braids and the grill and Texan Wire Wheels

You can tell how the boss live a boss life
Independent but I still live a boss life
Can't chill around me if you ain't boss like
My bitch a boss I only like the boss type

Aye
Stay stunting on niggas
Most of these frauds be fronting on niggas
Northside boss, went and got my figures
If you're mad at me for that
Stay mad at me nigga

Aye
Get the fuck out my grill
I don't really give a fuck how you feel
I'm just trying to stack me a new mil
Buy me a new Bentley, and throw on some new wheels
And that's real

I'ma tell you just how it is
Check my IG you can see how I live
If i said it, then I got it parked at the crib
At least 17 years

So many chains later
Still getting this paper
Still shitting on haters
Still your hoe's favorite
Nobody thought I'll make it, but I'm still here
Yeah, and I'm still real nigga

Nigga it's real

Hey, Hey

[Verse 2.1: Deff]

Yeah
Hopping out the coupe and getting used to choosing floozies
Use the juice to get them looser, like...
I
Used to be the loser, now I'm cruising through the jewelers
Swimming through like barracudas nigga
I
Grab them by the throat, and leave them flatter than a poster
I just had to blast them roaches like...
I'm
Chocking on the doja, I'm just smoking, I'm just smoking
I'm just going through the motions nigga...
I

I believe I'm the man
Crazy how I make it, I'm a fiend for the bands
Don't need to please them again, man it's easy to win
I guess it's just my season again
If a nigga talking about it, he's gonna need his hands
Give me the cash
I'ma need my fees in advance
I ain't stopping 'til I get the keys to the Jag
And after that I'm thinking of another reason again
Hey, hey
Man this shit is cli'near (clear)
I was broke last year, but I made a killing this year
Yeah, this year
Finally figured out that they can't fuck with this here
So now them haters disapp'neared (disappeared)

What?
Motherfucker you ain't real
Tell me how it feel, nigga you ain't real
Yeah, you probably feeling tough
Probably do not give a fuck
But your boo thang will

Real

[Verse 2.2: Deff]

I ain't playing with them, unless I'm playing for keeps
Dirty with this shit like I ain't bathe it in weeks
Talk is cheap so I don't mind paying to speak
We can fuck however late, but I ain't staying for sleep

Man I used to sell weed out my mama's house
But now I sell dreams out a better one
Yeah, where the fuck's my medicine?
Where the the fuck's my medicine?
Man it's evident that y'all ain't give me credit yet

Nope
Fuck it I'll just roll with it
You can worry about dissing, I'ma roll Swishers
Damn, what the hell happened to my old niggas
When my new phone rings with my old digits?

I'ma keep on swinging for the fences
Let's just say I got a million fucking chances
Money bands in my hand and I'm handsome
Yeah, and I'ma keep on standing in mansions

I talk about money cause I really got it
And you talking like you know me
What you know about it?
Lost in the profit, I'm a boss with the profit
Shit, I could probably fit some fucking cars in my closet

And now I'm on my god shit
Just another nigga on the top list, top list
I don't like to fuck unless she topless
Now she drop them drawers for the boss in the office
And she gonna suck me off 'til I'm dripping from the faucet?

Yes nigga
I don't ever stress
We done lit 3 blunts now they're in my chest
Mama said don't fuck with hoes, but that's a lost lesson, nigga
Cause I'm all in girl's pants like I'm crossdressing, nigga
