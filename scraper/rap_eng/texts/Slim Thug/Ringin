[Verse 1]
Money machine keep ringin'
Cellphone keep ringin'
I thought of that, then I made it be
Goddamn I'm a genius
God help me fight the demons
Sideways I be leanin'
I'm never home, 'cause I'm always gone
Doing work, trying to fill up arenas
I might do the Vert or the Beemer
Passenger side with a diva
Yeah my little baby be modeling
I fell in love when I seen her
Yeah, that's real shit, I ain't gotta lie about it I'mma keep it trill
Yeah, I'mma sign to myself
I ain't trippin' off your motherfuckin' record deal

[Chorus]
Money machine keep ringin'
Cellphone keep ringin'
I'm Master P with the hustle
It's been a minute since you seen it, yeah
Talkin' 'bout bossin' up
You too busy over there sellin' out, oh
And I'mma need mine right now
I ain't hearing what you talkin' 'bout
Money machine keep ringin'
Cellphone keep ringin'
I'm J Prince with the hustle
Nothin' ever come between it
Money machine keep ringin'
Cellphone keep ringin'
I'm Jay-Z with the hustle
Nothin' eever come between it
Yeah, if you really bossin' up, say it
If you really gettin' paper, say it
You really on your job like, yeah
Rings, yadda yadda yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm getting big pay
I'm getting big pay
I'm getting big pay
Pouring 4 up in my kool-aid
Fucking college bitches on a school day
Kicking flavor like loot 'kay
Getting Goku in a boxing match
I'm from the city where Rockets at
Hatin' fools and the chump is at
If you're wondering if the biz gave me the money, nigga
YEAH
She took the midgets, talking 'bout my health
I was smoking cookies in the jail
After this I'm going over there
Hot on the sauce from delivery
She got the patience to deal with me
She got the patience to feel on me
She got the patience to stick with me
All she wanna do is play on my flute like a symphony
My diamonds brighter than Tiffany
All my chalk is really run by the Christmas tree
Hickory dickory dickety, sauce run on me stickety, stickety
I want your wife to come drip on me

[Chorus]
Money machine keep ringin'
Cellphone keep ringin'
I'm J Prince with the hustle
Let it never come between it
Money machine keep ringin'
Cellphone keep ringin'
I'm Jay-Z with the hustle
Let it never come between it
Yeah, if you really bossing up, say it
If you really getting paper, say it
You really on your job like, yeah
Rings, yadda yadda yeah

[Verse 3]
Cellphone keep ringin'
Money machine keep ringin'
So the wrist stay blinging
Real life no dreaming
Jay-Z with the hustle
J Press with the muscle
Slim Thug with the shine
Master P with the grind
Hold it down, yeah I hold it down
Which Rolls am I rolling now?
Which rollie on my wrist now?
Who bitch is he with now?
Haters pissed, go sit down
Me and Cam shut shit down
Day one, been a boss
Putting on for the North
Used to live in apartments
The whole building ain't big as my house
Crowds cost a whole Bentley, so
Haters don't really offend me
I been stacking since smiley faces
Been balling since you had braces
I done pimped ho's, caught cases
But look at me baby, I made it

[Chorus]
Money machine keep ringin'
Cellphone keep ringin'
I'm J Prince with the hustle
Let it never come between it
Money machine keep ringin'
Cellphone keep ringin'
I'm Jay Z with the hustle
Let it never come between it
Yeah, if you really bossing up, say it
If you really getting paper, say it
You really on your job like, yeah
Rings, yadda yadda yeah, yeah
