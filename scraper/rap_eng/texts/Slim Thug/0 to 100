[Intro:]
Thugga!
KK on d beat

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
I go from 0 to a hundred nigga real quick
Hold up, it’s my time to gone kill this
Still the trillest, they tell lies I’m a realist
You might can’t relate cause you’re fake, feel this
They popping bottles all I need is 1 to get drunk
50 deep but 49 of them niggas punks
If you ain’t rollin light nigga you ain’t rollin right
Dro done drop head but I still spent the least tonight
Never trip but I still hit all yo bops
Showed a TBT they be toppin d drop
Throw back, had me all smiles Kodak
You all on the phone trying download low jack
Rap for fun but still making the funds
Few friends, smoke guns, rollin Harleys like d vons
Day 1, still cashing checks from "I Run"
They run, and be like "he got a gun"
Cowboys have Ferrari horses in them streets
Started from the bottom bitch I gotta eat
Lost sleep to live this Boss Life, stop playing lil niggas get your money right
(hold up)

[Verse 2: Delo]
I went from hundreds to a million nigga real quick
I got that Facebook hustle, you could deal with
I’m the last nigga around here rapping on some real shit
Had your bitch think about me when she hit the gear shift
This year I'ma let them know what it is
Two tape dropping I'ma hit them in their rib
It’s the new 6 zeros, 4 doors on the kick
Two hours outta state, zero fucks I'ma give
Got her talking like “Oh Lord! Oh Lord”
I know you watching over but I’m about to go for it
I’m bout to bring everything back from '94
Got my check looking right like I’m working offshore
Look I’m ready for whatever, for boys who want war
Haters wanna tweet they ain’t never gone score
They ain’t got no drive they ain’t never on point
How the hell they go ball they ain’t never on court
You can catch me in the paint like I’m moving on fours
Sipping 2 lines got me slippin off course
Two yellow thangs in that blue and white Porsche
I’m on that sea wall crawling, you define yours
Look this one for the OG’s, the real niggas
The all black gladiators come and deal with you
The short thick bitches that’ll come and chill with you
Boss Life Cigars, burning up the steel pitchers (look alive nigga!)

[Verse 3: Doughbeezy]
And I’m in the kitchen but only dope get cooked inside
And you would think we UPS the way we moving with the white, nigga
I don’t get tired I been up for 7 straight, a real nigga
But I ain’t never eat no booty in my life nigga!
I act a anus, should I start acting famous?
It has been over a year since I had to say what my name is
Used to fuck with ratchet hoes now my bitches speaking different language
I was raised to keep a hundred, and every year never missed a payment
And I go 0 to a hundred, I run it, minus the track shoes
City on my shoulders, I hold it until my back bruise
They usually say I’m bad news
Play the game to win, I only wear a size 10
But I bet I could walk a mile in Shaq’s shoes (Yea!)
The newest niggas that's showing boys how to do it bigger
Hungry like I’m back in the basement and in the booth with tigga
Diss me and you like Eddie Griffith, you just a foolish nigga
Lost and out here looking for a lesson, but I'ma school these niggas
Who these niggas claiming they cold, bitch I’m the coolest nigga
Repping in the streets showing naked, like I’m a nudist nigga!
Yeah, and we go 0 to a hundred thou, Houston niggas yeah we coming up, but always coming, down
