[Verse 1]
[?]
Now [?] H [?] Texas where I stay
If you need talking money stay the f*** about my way
Gotta wash for everyday
But I’m never on time
And I ain’t doing shit of what ain’t mine
Got a boss like my friend
Wan’t it I'ma get it
And that goes for this hoes
If I want it imma hit it
Can’t get to city
Get treated like I’m raw
To get teens in my city
And they outrun to score me
White folks and oh me
They think I play [?]
‘cause I’m guinness wanna stand as 6”6 tall
You can call me big slam to update my description
The purple egg got
It’s my favorite description
