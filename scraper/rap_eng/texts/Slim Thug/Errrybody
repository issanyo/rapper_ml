[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
Everybody say they sellin' dope
Everybody never been broke
Everybody on Instagram with them fake ass watches and them rented ass cars, you don't Sauce you a joke
Everybody wanna have sauce, everybody lost
Every pimp bitch out my house
Everybody wanna sell drank to them jack boys coming for the pints to your house
Everybody know Sauce films
Gold medal sittin' on the shelf
Swimmin' in the flavor, I'm Martin Luther King in the benz with a gun for the devil
Everybody wanna know the Sauce Twinz
All the hoes play the Sauce Twinz
Everybody know you a motherfucking clown cause you tell me when the fucking circus is
Pussy ass nigga, oh rookie ass nigga
Tryna cook your ass nigga, you ain't never pulled the trigger (ain't never)
But you tell everybody you a motherfucking killer (you ain't killed shit)
Everybody wanna be a big dawg, but you ain't never had a phantom like Sauce Hogg
You don't live the Boss Life, you don't live the Sauce life
Nigga you a motherfucking leap frog

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Everybody talkin' bout they real, everybody say they trill
Everybody claimin' they a boss
Everybody talkin' bout they G's and they won't snitch but they turn bitches they get caught
Everybody hatin' on each other
Instead of eatin' together, boys be competitin' with each other
I do this rap shit for the hustlers
If you ain't bout money then you ain't my customer
Everybody try to blame me like it's my fault
They ain't got no money in the vault
I cam from the bottom of the streets of the North
Grinded my way to this big ass house
Hell yeah that's all Imma talk about
I used to talk about [?] say a nigga dirty
Now I'm steppin' out GQ in my early thirties
Big bright white smile looking so pearly
In the hurry to the money, while you dummys looking lost
Drippin' in this bitch like the lil homie Sauce
Niggas still me waiting on me to fall off
They think I sell work, hopin' I get caught
My bad haters but I'm doing just fine
Stil climbin' up one level at a time
They on my IG tryna see what I'm buyin'
Or what's the next place that Imma be flying

[Verse 3: Sancho Saucy]
Everybody wanna win a grammy
Pimp a bitch in Miami
Everybody wanna be Sancho
Have a white ho on the flo'
Snortin' blow, gettin' dough out her panties
Every bitch wanna fuck the Sauce Twinz
Choose up just to ride Benz
Everybody wanna have gold teeth from king Johnny like Sanch
Everybody wanna drink punch

[Verse 4: 5th Ward JP]
Everybody know JP
Everybody hate JP
Everybody know I'm in the street
Everybody know where I be
Niggas know I really make noise in the street
Everybody know Iâ€™m crip
Everybody know I still drip
Big 40 make a body flip
Everybody know I'm top shotta
Pussy boy head Don Dadda
Pussy!
