[Hook: Beatking]
I lost all my friends, I lost all my friends
Chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check
Chasing that, chasing that, chasing that, chasing that, ooh

Hollup, I just want the money
Bitches say I'm acting funny
Chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, its a vet
Chasing that, chasing that check, holup, holup

[Verse 1: Beatking]
Club godzilla, ain't no nigga trilla
Off in VIP with the dealas and killas
Fifteen strippers, throw they ass back
I'ma rub these one's on yo asscrack
Niggas wanna hate, they don't make sense
Stevie Wonder at the skater ring
Swoop see the coupe, she know I got the juice
Dick in her face like Maybelline
I'm the [?], we in Oklahoma
We can fuck yo baby mama if we wanna
H-Town bitch, syrup and the soda
Mixing with the Xan make it throw tha
Bitch I get the paper like a folder
Flip flop paint [?] bipola
Just left club drinks finna leave high roller
Hoes call me baby like I'm riding in the stroller
Get the head, get the bread, kick her out like I don't know her
Chasing that check, chasing that, chasing that check
I don't need any friends, I just bought me a Benz
Fucking with DJ J Bone, he got some hoes he wanna bone
Call them bitches, club godzilla fucking all these strippers
This year I'm stunting on all these niggas
Holup

[Hook: Beatking]
I lost all my friends, I lost all my friends
Chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check
Chasing that, chasing that, chasing that, chasing that, ooh

Holup, I just want the money
Bitches say I'm acting funny
Chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, its a vet
Chasing that, chasing that check, holup, holup

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Chasing that check, chasing that check
Til I get about 100 mill on deck
I'm taking off fast like a jet
Gripping and sweat, where its at, where its at
All for the money, all I do is get paper
How the hell you think I got all these haters
How the hell you think I got million dollar neighbors
Big house in the birds, pen house skyscraper
Came from the bottom all the way to the top
And I still ain't stop, I'm still climbin' higher
Broke rappers mane saying I need to retire
The OG still keep putting out fire
Bitches mad at me cause I can't keep still
Still M.O.B til I get these bills
Ain't got friends, ain't got time to chill
Chasing these checks like [?]
OG Thugga for this pimpin' in my blood
Gotta paint a v if ya wanna be a thug
Tell ya baby mama come give a boss a hug
Tell em feds that I been quit selling drugs
Alergic to scrubs, only roll with the bosses
Tryna slow me down, tryna buy more houses
Me and Beatking steady working no losses
That's why all the haters on my dick, stay nauseous
Thugga

[Hook: Beatking]
I lost all my friends, I lost all my friends
Chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check
Chasing that, chasing that, chasing that, chasing that, ooh

Hollup, I just want the money
Bitches say I'm acting funny
Chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, chasing that check, its a vet
Chasing that, chasing that check, holup, holup
