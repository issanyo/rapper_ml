[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
We used to stand on the corner banging that UGK
If you see some feens don't hesitate to send them my way
I got a pocket full of stones
Diamonds against the wood
Stay ridin' dirty when I was flippin’ through my hood
Back then me and my nigga Z was sellin' that drank
We was sittin' on gallons, 400 of paint
Gettin' bank on Gulf Bank, ridin' drop down the Ave
Since I was a child I had dream of ridin' slabs
Wasn't thinking about Bentleys, couldn’t see that far
Shit even in my dreams, I couldn’t see that car
They say if you aim for the moon
You might land in the stars
Now look at me I’m living in the land of the stars(right)
Rovers and audemars mansions and penthouses
Went back bought  my hood  and made them all my rent houses
Still serving and collecting
Went from trappin' to rappin'
However it gotta get done
We gone make it happen

[Hook: Propain]
Riding to the finish line
Out here grinding till its dinner time
Too fresh, bouta ball nigga came from nothing
Stood up on my own two
We ain’t got jumping maine, its all I know
Man it's all that I know
Know these fuck niggas, fuckem all that's all that I know

[Verse 2: Propain]
Dreams of throwing forgiatos on the Rover truck
Thousand dollars like a million when you're broke as fuck
My generation wild nigga ain't no hope for us
Just peers and liquor all then I sizzle
That's the only escape till you sober up
That paper all that I need
Fuck
Had them all stealing had shit from h to all of my jeans
And if that alarms sounding my tape all that they see
Fuck 12 i know its at g
If I went to school with that off brand
Them fuck boys gone be laughing at me
Laughing at me
So now we’re fly
With that paper lookin’ like moon and stars
Far away went from polo shirts up to booster cars
Chop shop, chop shop and our dollars up
So back then if  you came outside and if your shit was missing
It was probably us
Then the tables turned
Falling off a move was slipping i was lighting em up
At the same time got a phone call
That them bitch niggas shot my bra
Now the whole hood hot as fuck
Got them hoe haeds hot at us
Crash told me bout smash em all
So verse to verse
The same thousand ain’t shit
When yo trying to get the millions
Propain made the bread
Started from the bottom lookin at the ceiling
And all my niggas grubbin with me
Young legend in the fucking city
Seen it all back to the wall
Top down and then fuck them all
