Wars won, no losses, who wanna compete?
With the Chief of the Police, who got the keys to the streets
Full time hustler, part time rhymer
I'm having thangs Pharrell, you punks ain't no Grinders
You fools just went to school and learned to use Pro Tools?
And tried to cop you a G, lose, on the ten o'clock news
You can't survive in my shoes or afford to pay my dues
Wit your cartoon crews, you niggas destined to lose
I rock Eminem and 50 Cent crowds
And spend most of my weekends cruising above clouds
From the West to the Southway to the East Coast
Switch time zones more than ho's switch clothes
Born to be on top, born to call shots
Born to cop drops and trick off fats knots, like a boss
Stack knots, boss, boss
Cop drops, boss, boss
On top, boss, boss
Paid Tha Cost, boss, boss
When I floss like a boss
Big house, boss, boss
Rep the North like a boss

Who the boss, nigga? Who the motherfucking boss?
Who the boss, nigga? You see the motherfucking boss
Call me Sarge, I'm the head nigga in charge
You see the B on the 'Nage parked in the garage?
I'm the coach, I wrote them plays for my team
I'm the mastermind behind these teams wit green
I call all the shots, provide all the knots
Supply all the rocks and sponsor spots
I stay on the top floor, got the Executive Suite
Sit in the corner chair where me and my niggas meet
Sport the Presidential Rolly, got a driver that drive
I don't open doors no more, he do it from outside
Club, they lock off V.I.P. for me
And send cases of crystal to my section for free
I got a three and half carat diamond on my pinkie ring?
Respected in these streets, they treat me like a King
I get accepted like family, your house is my house
I guess that's why they call me, 'Slim Thug Tha Boss'
I call shots, boss, boss
Stack knots, boss, boss
Cop drops, boss, boss
On top, boss, boss
Paid Tha Cost, boss, boss
When I floss, boss boss
Big house like a boss
Rep the North like a boss
Who the boss, nigga? Who the motherfucking boss?
Who the boss, nigga? Who the mother, boss, boss?
Who the boss, nigga? Who the mother, boss, boss?
Who the boss, nigga? You see the mother, boss boss
Call shots like a boss
Stack knots like a boss
