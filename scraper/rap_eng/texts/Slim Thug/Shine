Shining, different colored diamonds
Slab on the road, and there's six more behind em
Grinding, sipping on the finest
Slab on the road, drop, drop, drop, grinding
Shining, different colored diamonds
Slab on the road, and there's six more behind em
Grinding, sipping on the finest
Slab on the road, drop, drop, drop, grinding

[Verse 1-Slim Thug]
Thugga, and I stay up on some fly shit
Everyday I buy shit
New drop Camaro with the matte white on the side of it
Oh you think she bad? She only my side bitch
My main bitch at home, and she one of the flyest
BHO in this ho, it my be a riot
Now we just posted in the background quiet
Smoking on loud, drunk den a bitch
I told my hood I was goin act a fool when I get rich
Now this money keep coming, so I'mma keep stunting
Lac's back to back, these niggas be fronting
I live a Hogg life
Party all night
We do this everyday, 6 AM I'm on a flight

Grinding, sipping on the finest
Slab on the road, drop, drop, drop, grinding

[Verse 2-Slim Thug]
Shining, I know these haters so sick of me
Been killing blocks 10 years, its no sympathy
Every season something new, no days off
Talking shit on these beats sure payed off
Got the Phantom, told the dealer take the shades off
I wanna let these bitches see I cut the braids off
Fit layed out, still can't pick a color
White, black, or yellow diamonds, What up Thugga?
It's on you, on chrome shoes
Poking out, yeah, you know how that H do
Shining, rocking different colored diamonds
We stay showing out, cause we stay grinding

[Hook]
Shining, different colored diamonds
Slab on the road, and there's six more behind em
Grinding, sipping on the finest
Slab on the road, drop, drop, drop, grinding
Shining, different colored diamonds
Slab on the road, and there's six more behind em
Grinding, sipping on the finest
Slab on the road, drop, drop, drop, grinding

[Verse 3-E.S.G.]
S to the H to the I-N-E
Hogging like its meant to be
I used to tell my momma I'd be balling eventually
From elementary, to the penitentiary
Now I might pull a Pimp C
Candy red Bentley
Big face Rollie gold
S-U-C throwed
Big blue, orange Crush, call it Tim Tebow
30 degrees, below
Flow cold, sub zero
My uncle had them bricks, roll model, thug hero
Got a plug on the d-low
Chose the wrong route
Now I be rapping and trapping and stacking at my grandma's house
Buy paper in the south
Yeah we invented stunt
Y'all better watch the throne, me and Slim T coming

Grinding, sipping on the finest
Slab on the road, drop, drop, drop, grinding
