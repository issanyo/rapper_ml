(Verse 1, Slim Thug)
What them boys know about this H-Town pimpin?
Hoes by the dozen, never doin no simpin
Hit the strip club, I ain't doin no tippin
I'm billin up my team, knockin niggas for they women
See they lookin for the honey, we lookin for the money
I'm breakin hoes, makin dough, laughin at them dummies
Got a team of go-getters, droppin stacks in my lap
Ain't no drought sellin pussy, so I stopped sellin crack
I'm a motherfuckin mac, and I ain't talkin bout computers
If a bitch come short, I'ma beat her up or shoot her
Thug boss, Juice-J on the track spittin pimpin
H-Town, Memphis Tenn., hat leanin while I'm limpin

NORTH
I'm ridin through the hood and I'm screamin chuuch
Tryina get my hands in the bottom of a hoes purse
And I'm checkin traps cause this crack is jumpin back
Even if I have to rob a jack for the money rats
Ike Turner pimpin in this game, it just hittin a bitch
It can mean ya all about'cha grind and ya hustlin
Lettin a forty-four wit a mask, or by usin ya fists
Or somethin automatic like a chopper with some extra clips
Get up off yo ass, no more puff or pass
We gon hit this block, we gon get this cash
And its up for grabs, jump on this real fast
Billy Wes, you tell 'em how we make it last

(Verse 3, DJ Paul)
I got game for the lame, prayers for the squares
If a hoe piss me off, her face gonna need repairs
I got stitches for the bitches if they playin with my riches
I know they wanna get in the air, but they better be beware
I'll track her ass down like GPS, out here
That means I'ma get'cho pussy ass, I swear
I'ma pimp by blood, my music's young
My brother Benzo was a pimp, he knock a ho unconscious
But he died by the hands of a coward ass trick
But don't worry bout it bro, cause we got that bitch!
I'ma keep the pimpin alive like you never even left
Still workin these hoese like the king Hugh Heff
