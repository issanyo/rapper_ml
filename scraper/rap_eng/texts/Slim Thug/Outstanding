[Intro]
I'mma call you mamma, you call me pappa

[Verse 1]
This world is mine, all mine, but I'm willing to share
I'll split it with 50/50 if you willing to pound
Baby got a nigga feeling her
This feeling is rare
Got my head touching the ceiling
Shit is still in the air, yeah
'cause she's a bad bitch
That got her own shit
Can buy her own purse
And pay her own rent
Never beg for money
Got a good job
She just finished school, now she living large
Stay working hard, make a nigga wanna help
It's such a turn on to know she can do it herself
The only thing you're missing queen is your king
Together I can take you to see your dreams

[Chorus]
Is she about to catch a body?
Body bad like her ass, working for these
I'm about to blow the bag on you, probably
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'mma tell the truth
You know, you're outstanding
Girl you knock me out
Exciting, yeah, you make me wanna shout

[Verse 2]
I'm talking pretty when she wake up
Don't even need no make-up
Can suck a mean dick and can cook a mean steak up
She got a nigga focused, them other ho's hopeless
Compared to my girl
She make them bops look like roaches
A dime on the scales, shorty fine as hellk
Christian Louis Vuitton heels, got that ass sitting real
Got other chicks checking her fit
Niggas trying to hit, talking 'bout
Thugger, you done hit a lick
I know my bitch the shit, that why she my bitch
And since she my bitch she gon' get what I get
She down for a nigga, so I figured I might wife her
I like her, and so I had to go ahead and invite ya'

[Chorus]
Is she about to catch a body?
Body bad like her ass, working for these
I'm about to blow the bag on you, probably
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'mma tell the truth
You know, you're outstanding
Girl you knock me out
Exciting, yeah, you make me wanna shout

[Verse 3]
We taking first-class trips just to fulfill her fantasies
Overseas, chauffeur please
To be the best restaurant, we dine on fine wine
Having a good time, trying to get up in her mind
On top of the line designs, what's yours is mine
What's mine's is yours, Gucci and Louis stores
On a shopping spree, who's stopping me?
Pass the broccoli, grab the cheese
At least 50 G's, I got with me
But only for baby, them other broads get none
Ain't worried 'bout them other broads, baby number one
She in the bauws house, got the keys to the car
Our Lexus, this ain't mine, it's ours
Under stars on the Range roof, just me and you, damn I love the way you do you
You the truth
Can make any pop the balls boo, girl you special
Kept it 100 with a nigga, had to bless ya'
