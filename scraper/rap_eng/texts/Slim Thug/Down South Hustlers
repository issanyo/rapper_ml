[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
All my bitches say I'm dirtier than a motherfucker
Pineapple fanta and it's dirtier than a motherfucker
Shot out to Bun I'm ridin' dirty than a motherfucker
A half a million, all 20's it got blood on it
Presidential day-day and it's flooded homie
I just left the car loft and spend another check
Hunnid band profit and I didn't break sweat
I dozed of on that drank and almost had another wreck
My lil bitch stay mad at me cause I don't get no rest
I'm always out here chasin' money so she get no sex
I'm in that drop top, bangin' Screw and burnin' rubber nigga
I'm down in Houston on that boss shit like Thugga, nigga
Got everythang on my own so I'm like fuck a nigga
World wide, cross the county stackin' ruffles nigga

[Hook: Young Dolph]
She a good girl but lil' mama bad though
She got a small waist but a fat ass though
Thirty points I had to take came in the glass though
Still boomin' pills and strong out the back door

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I got G's out of Memphis that'll kill for me
And everywhere I go the hood still love me
Cause Thugga is a hustler, Thugga is a boss
Thugga made it trough them droughts on that nasty North
Me and Paul still tippin', sippin' with that Dolph
Got 'em ridin', red fo's, breakin' boys off
Kottonmouth kush blunts back to back
Nowadays ridin' Rovers but still keep a clean  'Lac
Thank god everyday, I ain't gotta sell packs
I ain't tryna see the FED's I like my bed where it's at
Countin' these stacks like I'm gettin' platinum plaques
Livin' that boss life, breakin' hoes like the mack

[Hook: Young Dolph]
She a good girl but lil mama bad though
She got a small waist but a fat ass though
Thirty points I had to take came in the glass though
Still boomin' pills and strong out the back door

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
No nuts mean no money
No money you must be a dummy
No dummy that's a fifth wheel
It's only March but this my fifth grill
Packin' the steel, chasin' the mill
Workin' the wheel, yeah I'm the man
Make me a ticket and I fuck it all off
Codeine [?] and kush cause I can
Chain with the chunk a 70 grand
Trunk with the bang it sound like a band
Whenever I pass it's turnt like a vent
Pardon me girl I know she a fan
On lean with a xan
Backwood packed with 3 or 4  grams
Thumbin' through money
Got codeine sweatin' out all of my glands
Oil change, this new drank just ain't the same
Scopin' out boppers long range
But not for profit they chasin' change

[Hook: Young Dolph]
She a good girl but lil' mama bad though
She got a small waist but a fat ass though
Thirty points I had to take came in the glass though
Still boomin' pills and strong out the back door
