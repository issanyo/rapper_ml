[Verse 1]
I used to ride around, selling weed on my peddle bike
Shit was slow, I took time and I got it right
Cats know my face, I'm the same yute that took every change
I used to wish on a couple bags but nowadays, that's penny change
This shits mad! I put a 20 down in 7 days
I've done bird but that's nothing cos
It's been 3 years for my nigga [?] off these roads (Free ma nigga!)
In my trap spot, my pyrex full of snow
My wrist hurtin', I been workin', I cop work and it goes
I'm a young nigga thats really paid, me and dem ain't in the same boat
They got a flashy watch and nice shoes, but I know they ain't copped no smoke
That's stupid, I finished work, need a new brick
I fell in love with money from the trap and its nuttin' to do wit Cupid

[Verse 2]
Everyday I wake up and no doubt Imma take that risk
Take two steps in the trap house, hit the stove and scrape that dish
Same work but a different pack; same block but a different trap
I got no chill, I'm so real, I go too H.A.M
When he hit the pipe, it was too mad
You got a lot of talk, but your left wrist is like two grand (joking)
And I used to check for a lotta man
But nowadays I got no love, we can't relate, they got no plan
Thats useless, my whippin' game is stupid
I told bro I ain't gonna stop, then I came home and I proved it
35 for a whole one, there's 30 bells in my new (shh)
And nothings changed, but nowadays when I wake up and turn my phone on it goes nuts!
It's jumpin! Cos how many times did I take that risk, go back that work and bank it
30 bags and a rubber band, thats my idea of a sandwich
This shit is all I know, I came up selling O's
Give me a peppermint tea and a bowl of oats, and I'm ready to hit the roads

[Verse 3]
I got no love! Cos back then I had no funds
Now I'm sittin down in a German whip, doing 140 wit no clutch!
And I looked up to a lotta man
Now I see dem, and its not that, they looked pissed that they're not with man
I can't stop! I take the risk, work my ass off
My left wrist cost a whole box and my re-up is a bit mad , it's silly
I'm putting work in any city
I'm real good, I don't need niggas
I had a clean month, now I'm one deep countin' 50 (50 racks)
