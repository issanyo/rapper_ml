Been made my name my self
Little nigga I don’t need no help

[Verse 1:] [Sosa Mann]
Uhh

Flowing like i’m in a boat
93 that’s all a nigga smoke
Half crunk
Turn this shit into a [?]
Playin dumb over a bitch
Going [?]
On a punch and they got him on the [?]
I’m kicking shit like I’m in the dojo
Get a free [?] everywhere I go
The money machine
Keep counting the green
I’m dumbin through all the [?]
Self made
Got em young niggas thirsty
Self paid
Count cheques not [?]
I remember when i used to have nothin’
Had to grind for a whole lot of sum’in
I’m a giant in the streets
Stop frontin

Got’damn
It’s a shame
You a lame
With no chain

Ridin behind Slim Thug
In a Range

Switching lanes
Candy paint white burn cocaine
And everything I got
I got it out the game

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:][Slim Thug]
Hey
Been made a name for myself
Who did it like me nobody else
Remember Young Thug out the [?]
Went from being broke
Nowadays he a boss
Used to wrap bucks
Now I rap [?]
Straight on Homestead
Now stay torn
Used to rap drop [?]
Now I gotta drop head
And I thank God I ain’t never seen the Feds
Came a long way
Started from the bottom like Drake
Niggas don’t get it
I’m my own rapper
Do this shit alone
There’s too many niggas out here fakin
Too bad being broke
Keeping steaks on my plate
Eating good everyday
Like I’m tryna gain weight
Call me the number 1 hustler in the state
Got [?] chasing after the nigga like bait
Hey
Been made a name for myself
By myself
I ain’t need no help
Fuck being broke
Tryna seek wealth
Cross me that’s bad for your health
Chop you up
Take your seatbealt
Niggas went right so they got left
I’m doing me nigga nobody else
I’m doing me nigga nobody else
Thug

[Chorus]
