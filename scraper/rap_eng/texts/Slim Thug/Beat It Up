[Slim Thug:]
Baby girl, listen up, let me holla for a second
I ain't tryin' to be rude, I'm just tryin' to get you naked
I figured if I kept it 100, you'll respect it
I know you tired of niggas lyin' to you, so check it
I ain't tryin' to settle down, but I wanna fuck
I wanna be behind you when you back that pussy up
You look like a good girl, I'm a make you my slut
I bet you like it slow, I'm a make you like it rough
See I'm the type of nigga that'll fuck your life up
Make you leave your man when he tryin' to wife you up
'Cause that nigga borin' I'm in to explorin'
You only with that nigga for them things that's important
He got a good job & a real good father
Layed in debt but damn girl. Why bother?
You need excitement in your life, fuck with me
Quit settlin' for squares, fall in love with a G

[Chorus: Dallas Blocker]
Guess what? I'm fuckin' tonight
Whether you know it or not I'm a beat that pussy right
Yeah, I'm fuckin' tonight
See, I'm a beat that pussy up
(I'm a Beat It Up) [3x]
I'm a beat that pussy up
(I'm a Beat It Up) [3x]
(I ain't gotta eat it up)

[Slim Thug:]
I'm tryin' to lay in it, then play in it
If it's good all night, I'm a stay in it
Sway in it if it's tight, I'm a get it right
Hop on top, you know what your daddy like
Ride it like a bike, baby, don't fall off
I wanna see them titties bouncin' take it all off
She tryin' to crawl off say it's in too deep
Bust so much, she quit & tryin' to fall asleep
Turn that ass over, back stroke woke her up
Grab her by hell while I slap her on the butt
I'm about to bust, pulled out snatched the rubber off
And like a trill bitch she let me put it in her mouth

[Chorus: Dallas Blocker]
Guess what? I'm fuckin' tonight
Whether you know it or not I'm a beat that pussy right
Yeah, I'm fuckin' tonight
See, I'm a beat that pussy up
(I'm a Beat It Up) [3x]
I'm a beat that pussy up
(I'm a Beat It Up) [3x]
(I ain't gotta eat it up)

[Dallas Blocker:]
Is you gon' let me rock it? Say you'll let me rock it
I'm a gon' beat it 'til the walls come a knockin'
Baby don't stop it, open, let me drop it
Turn that ass around & get it beat by Dallas Blocker
You need to never mind it, you'll be on the mountain
I'm a take a shower & just act like we've been nappin'
Guess what? I'm fuckin' tonight... yeah
So baby if your down, call me over, I will be around
I'll be on the other side of town
Hit me if you wanna fuck around

[Chorus: Dallas Blocker]
Guess what? I'm fuckin' tonight
Whether you know it or not I'm a beat that pussy right
Yeah, I'm fuckin' tonight
See, I'm a beat that pussy up
(I'm a Beat It Up) [3x]
I'm a beat that pussy up
(I'm a Beat It Up) [3x]
(I ain't gotta eat it up)
