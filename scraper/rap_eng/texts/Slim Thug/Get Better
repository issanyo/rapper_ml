Yea hold your head up
You know what I’m talking about man
I want to know what you going to do today

[Hook]
I know it’s hard I see the pain in your eyes
But that never lasts forever  it gets better
I know it’s rough but baby girl keep your head up
I pray to God it’s going to get better
I know it’s slow but grind until it gets better
Watch you get your bread up it’s going to get better
I know you feel like giving up but don’t let up
Keep pushing I promise it’s going to get better

[Verse 1]
Once you get your bread up it’s going to get better
I know you feel like giving up but don’t let up
Keep pushing I promise it’s going to get better
The best thing I can tell you it get better
Weather you broke sick or locked up read this letter
Can’t skip the struggle that’s how you build a muscle
Hard time build you and show you who’s loyal
It’s a blessing in disguise when it’s rough who gonna ride
I catch you by surprise just watch open up your eyes
Enjoy the level remember the pain
So you know for sure that later that shit ain’t for you man
Get back on game and get up and get your change
We all been a victim of the problem of public
Life’s a bitch but i still love it so
I have made it through my worst times together
If it’s your worst time and remember it only gets better

[Hook]
I know it’s hard I see the pain in your eyes
But that never lasts forever  it gets better
I know it’s rough but baby girl keep your head up
I pray to God it’s going to get better
I know it’s slow  but grind until it gets better
Watch you get your bread up it’s going to get better
I know you feel like giving up but don’t let up
Keep pushing I promise it’s going to get better

[Verse 2]
It gets bad but it gets better
Don’t quit until you get your shit together
Don’t stop until you lay your dreams  up
Other wise you lost God gave you a gift
And if you don’t use it you lost
Can take away your joy but can’t take away  your skills
Go be your own boss that’s how you start making the mills
Just keeping it real cause shit why is it that we here
Why not just hustle to the top to see how it feels
If it’s out there for the taking I’m a make it
You can sit and watch get up and get it shaking
You only live once so why not be your best
I got to get better so I’m not going to settle for less I mean that

[Hook]
I know it’s hard I see the pain in your eyes
But that never lasts forever  it gets better
I know it’s rough but baby girl keep your head up
I pray to God it’s going to get better
I know it’s slow  but grind until it gets better
Watch you get your bread up it’s going to get better
I know you feel like giving up but don’t let up
Keep pushing I promise it’s going to get better
I know it’s hard I see the pain in your eyes
But that never lasts forever  it gets better
I know it’s rough but baby girl keep your head up
I pray to God it’s going to get better
I know it’s slow  but grind until it gets better
Watch you get your bread up it’s going to get better
I know you feel like giving up but don’t let up
Keep pushing I promise it’s going to get better
