Rubberband banks
Ballin' in my six (ballin')

Different chains everyday

Everywhere, I got diamonds everywhere
Matchin grillz homie

Everywhere, I got diamonds everywhere
I got (I got I got I got I got)

[Paul Wall:]
Panamera turbo
Black on black on chrome
Crawling down like a gerbil'
Redbone givin' me dome
Xanax after this narco
Gimme name brand no crumb
I just scored two P's of the herbo
Can't talk about that this on this phone
No sir
I-I be shinin' hard
'cause I be grindin' hard
I be on my hustle
While you at home wit yo broad
I Run the game you Jog
They be like Oh my God
Got syrup poured in my 2-cup
So I don't have no car
I'm icey on my neck
I'm icey on my neck
They think I move weight like badly
I'm wit Pascale in the valley
We be on that whale shit
From the wrist in fact to clarmaddy
Got yo bitch callin' me daddy
While you gettin dat ho name tatted
I'm zonin'

I got diamonds everywhere
Bitch I'm shinin' everywhere
Earrings quarter mill' a pair
And all my bitches like to share
You be fuckin' with them squares
All my bitches gettin paid

Since I was in seventh grade
Had to grind to get them J's
Addicted to gettin paid
Keep a Caddy candy sprayed
Big crib and I hit my maid
Rubber band banks
Switch chains like it's clothes
I switch my swag up
And now I switched up my ho
Froze cold as a freezer
Soon's I skeezer then I leave her
Beat the (beat the) pussy up
You pay her bills
That's why she needs ya

And get DDS domes
Two bad bitches in their thongs
Walkin naked through my home
Thugga!

Bust a nut roll a blunt
Then it's back to my riches

Diamonds shinin for me grindin

Double take I'm not a rapper
