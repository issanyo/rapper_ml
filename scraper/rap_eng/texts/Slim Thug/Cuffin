-And though we gotta say good-bye-
Dis is bye-bye bitches
-For da summer-
"Thugga"
-Baby I promise you dis-
I mean you know what I'm sayin' It's been fun mayne, ya know
-I gave you all my love-
A lotta memories in da game
-everyday dat I had..-
A lot of beautiful memories

Hoes keep calling I ain't pickin' up
Hoes keep calling I ain't pickin' up
"Thugga"
Hoes keep calling I ain't pickin' up

Treat 'em like dey treat us bitch, you broke as fuck
I ain't tryna pay your bills, stop beggin'
I don't care how fat dat ass looks in leggin's
I know you're here to fool but baby I'm cool
She got more miles than my old school
I'm too old to be dealing with dees hoes
Dat ain't got no goals just tryna get choose
Make a thought hop out my rolls
She's standin' out da back of dees suicide doors
Boys be talkin' down said I ain't da shyit
Hoppin' out of your Camry made in '06
Before you be a hater bitch get rich
You can't tell me how to get paid if you ain't got shyit
But you right I'm not shyit, but
I'm da shyit compared to you so stay off my dick
"Thugga"

Yeah, you know it's 2k14
Mo Life mayne fuck dees hoes
Wanna fuck around we fuck up and die
Look
Now who dat, who are you bitch who da fuck you think
It's Garz, Mr Barz smootha' than a mink
I can see you standin' in da club waitin' fo a drank
Bitch I wouldn't pitch you water commin' out da sink
Go somewhere and put your face on in da bathroom
You an embarrassment to da classroom
Swear you're on steak but you really on can food
How you a bad bitch when you been ran through
I keep a new bitch around 5' 4"
And a couple Goons with a slide-door
Married to da game, shyit what I need a bride fo
My watch froze shyit what I got time fo
Labels hit me up, whatchu gonna sign fo
Shyit I'm like what I needa lie fo
Hit Slim up, I'm like what you think G
He like charge dat ass up like I wouldda done in nine-fou
Now my money stretch like dat long jump
And my side bitches leave when da sun up
Elevated to da top now I gun up
To tell 'em where I'm at when dey see dis song up
