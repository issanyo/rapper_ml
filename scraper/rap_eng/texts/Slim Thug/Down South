Down south is where I stay
Switch fo' lanes
Let My Nuts Hang
From the Antoine to the MLK
These H-Town boys like to swang and bang

(Slim Thug)
Now welcome to the City of Game, piece and chains that swang
Pop trunk and bang as I grip wood grain
I'm bout that down-south city, where they show no pity
Candy paint be lookin' pretty, makin' haters feel shitty
See I'mma long star balla, and a chop shop crawler
18-year-old shot callah, and a droptop crawler
I'm no less than the best, yes I must confess
And hell that Cess in my chest to relive off stress
Freshly pressed in my Guess, I got that baguettes on my chest
It's 3rd coast in do' and the rest must wreck
Went from'a BMX to a GS Lex, born and raised in Houston Tex
Where we don't bar no plex
NOW ..

(Mista Madd)
Down South .. you know we real baby
Even if we ride a Hoodoo or a foreign made Mercedes
Rocks in my wrist, gat close to hip
Just in case a hater out there gets me pissed
Man I'm so real, man I'm so trill
'99 I'm tryin' to get the million dollar deal
Like C-Note I'm tryin' to have diamonds in my grill
And I'm breakin' boys off with my freestyle skills
Givin' them something they can feel, man just chill
Man what the deal with the syrup and the pill
In the lac' wit cat with 18's in da trunk
Da Alpine thump, it's SCREW that we bump
TV in steering wheel, with fifth wheel in the back
Went to town I keep it hot with five plates up in da dash
Wearin' white socks and dem black Nike sandals
We down-south nigga's this something yall can't handle
Ride man I'm drippin' so much up on da freeway
Down-south baby switchin' lanes up on da freeway
Wouldn't give a good-goddamn about the he say, she say
Cause when u down talk me you saw me you be sayin', "Damn he paid!"

Here I come, Here I come, I know you see me comin'
Drop my bumper on Antoine, pick it up on the Fondren
Steady hummin' I be stunnin' like a bag of diamonds
I be shinin' I be rewindin', man wood on the vinyl
I'm a minor, wood on the vinyl
Broke dem boys off cause Yungstar still a finer
Houston's finest artist, I'm da smartest, boys get rigormortis
I'm crawlin' real slow on 4's like a tortoise, like a toad
I'm in da mode, fix'n to explode, hoppin' out my rides do's
Got the Kenneth Cole on my toes, I'm so th'owed
I'm complete, unique from my feet from my head to my feet, something sweet

Down south is where I stay

From the Antoine to the MLK (DAWG, man I got this)

(Yungstar)
Got lavish habits, I'm the rhymin' acrobatic
Your boy he da baddest, naw I'm da maddest
I done slipped, I done slid'a, house-town got wider
Broke dem boys off now I'm a work provider
I'm a nation, slide on my Datons
Bounce, rock and skate'n, got a 'Tendo and a Station
Maybe Super Sega, glide like Omega
Messin' with these boys I be ridin' with a Vega
Come'n grill'n woman, real clear, all up in their ear
Baggets and Pioneer, once a year
I'm bout dat Belvedere, I'm a butler, I'll reached out and touch'a
Break des boys off with baggets and clusters
Round my neck, if you disrespect grab my Tech
And leave you wet on the set I don't expect
Won't be da Gama I'm mo shake and I'mma ram'ya
Moved to Alabama, and got silk pajamas
Got silk sandals, I ride sled I turn their heads
Boys get scared u better call the word "FED"
I rock u don't stop got Gucci shoes and socks
Sewed up da block, like da Pac I won't stop
We dangerous, dismantle, wood upon da panel
Nike shoes, Nike sandals, light my girl with a candle, handle
Knock on do's, do's done get froze
As I pull out da wide body candy red low (low low low)

Watch I roll red maybe roll blue or green I'm on the scene
Diamond ring Byzantine, I'mma swang I'm a swanger
Watchin' Cliffhanger, screens fall I'mma ball
Better get Disc Changer
In the deck u come wreck, immitate deck
Slide I'mma ride by that dis-respecial effect
Diamonds bling bling, swang and I swing
Matchin' pinky ring, Antwon to the King
Here I come here I come, yeah this Yungstar comin'
Real with da woman, hear da bang think its thunder
Naw it ain't thurder it's just me, see da candy jet ski
Read da lights its TYP, Throwed Yung Playa
I'm da mayor of the Himalayas
My diamonds glare, wide body valeter
Here he come here he ..
Mann bring it back I'm ready I'm ready
