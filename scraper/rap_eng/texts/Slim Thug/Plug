[Verse 1]
Plug
Plug
[?] out from the plug twice
‘Cause I found me a better price
Didn’t jack pay it all back
‘cause  the esse could take your life
Fact fell when I do badness
Don’t steal and I never will
‘Am a hustler with morals
My own skills can pay out my bills
I’ll f*** with no F*** niggas
All I kick you with these kings
He lead the [?] without look
I promise for nobody steal a thing
Whole team bosses get money
Whole team silent been oh
With them selling bricks in the hood
Now we’re in the hood selling brick hoes
Only stupid niggas never change
[?] Swat hustlers get better
Identify what you gift [?]
And get your ass something
Go get some [?]
