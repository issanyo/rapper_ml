[Intro]
Hold up
Roll up
Pull up
Blow up
I’m from H town Texas bitch
I’m from H town Texas bitch
I’m from H town Texas bitch

It’s only right the real represent
Raised on that North you can’t be South
Since I was seventeen man I been a boss
Told my mama quit her job and bought a house
Told my brother let’s go break these n*ggas off
Pulled up in the slap dripping candy blue
Better hide your chick cause I’ll take your boo
We don’t give a damn about n*ggas like you
And we pull them choppers and use them too
These n*ggas think they tough but  I don’t buy it at all
Talking about you got it but you n*ggas ain’t balling
I be focus grinding since I was a kid
Ain’t too many n*ggas did what I did
Back when I was broke I used to dream of stunting
Had to wait my turn waiting with the fronting
Got it on my own was my own boss
Make my mama move in when I got a house
Got a watch a junior cause he living with me
Single father still keep it G
Smoked this Cali kush like I get it free
And I’m a be a G til i D.I.E
Cause I stay real never sold out
That’s why I’m in that Rolls when I roll out
Still stay Texas know what I’m talking about
Brother’s still winning never fell off
Never fell off cause I’m my own boss
Always kept a mattress super old house
Always kept a Bentley in my driveway
Always kept a bitch’s diamonds around this way
Bitch I live a boss live I been about mine
F*ck being broke I’m chasing dollar signs
Came from the bottom I was talking grind
And since I came up I ain’t went back down
Can’t nobody say they loan me shit
Can’t nobody say I owe them shit
Can’t nobody say they pay for shit
Cause I’m a real boss bitch
Had it on my own had it on my own
Them n*ggas ain't no bosses man them n*ggas some clowns
Telling all these lies all in yo songs
I had your bitch at the crib giving dome
Came up strong in the game n*gga
Seventeen is the inner lane n*gga
You n*ggas is some trick you should be ashamed n*gga
You O.G must ain’t give you no game n*gga
You n*gga’s looking goofy out here doing shit
You n*ggas out a crying behind all these chicks
I just dick em down then it’s on to the next
You mad because I hit it first you got [?]
Ain’t no real n*ggas out here no more
Cause that’s why all these n*ggas act like hoes
All these n*ggas say they selling dope
But all these n*ggas still broke
Talking like you got it but you ain’t got shit
I be dropping tops with ya main chick
Got her at the crib riding on this dick
I’m a keep shining why would I quit
