[Verse 1]
I’d a seen it all in my life at least twice
You think you know but now you don’t know my life
I try to walk around everyday stress free
But seems like everyday someone stress me
If it ain’t my baby momma trying to piss a nigga off
It would be a pussy nigga to get hit in the mouth
But talking too much and talking too tough
Got to learn the hard way just to shut the fuck up
They want to see us stop they want to see up empty
That is why these hoes throw the pussy on me trying to tempt me
I can’t fall out i’m the mother fucking boss
Crushing up the suckers when they see me pulling out
They killers that searching they killers that lurking
You come around me and I’m going to be the one murky
Mamma green mamma green better
Reko and Chedda we in this together
We all in this together
Niggas hold ya head up

[Hook]
And all my niggas on lock hold your head
And all my niggas getting high hold a head
And all my g’s in the trap hold ya head
And if you lost a nigga RIP hold ya head

[Verse 2]
Everyday work hard until it’s easy
Sometime I feel lost but I let the Lord lead me
This world fucked up I don’t know who to trust
Enemies pretend to be your friend and least up
Snitches out for a nigga and will put you in a cup
The judge say 10 or 20 to life ain’t enough
It’s rough for a street nigga trying to have something
Seem like everywhere you looking a nigga coming
Grown ass man that can dress like a woman
It gotta be a sign that the end of the world coming
I try to smoke and keep my mind stress free
But everyday someone trying to test me
But I never lose always come out on top
And if you in the way you gonna get your ass dropped
They say where those keep can only make you stronger
The pain hurt but good time last longer

[Hook]
And all my niggas on lock hold your head
And all my niggas getting high hold a head
And all my g’s in the trap hold ya head
And if you lost a nigga RIP hold ya head
And all my niggas on lock hold your head
And all my niggas getting high hold a head
And all my g’s in the trap hold ya head
And if you lost a nigga RIP hold ya head
And all my niggas on lock hold your head
And all my niggas getting high hold a head
And all my g’s in the trap hold ya head
And if you lost a nigga RIP hold ya head
