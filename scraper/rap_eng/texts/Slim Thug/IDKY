[Hook]
I don’t understand why the world so cold
World so cold
I’m still here trying to feed my baby
Baby ya
I’m just here trying to ensure that we make it
I can’t see why these niggas still hating
I guess cause the streets fucked up
Fucked up the streets fucked up
Yea the streets fucked up
Yah yah yea the streets fucked up
Fucked up fucked up
Yea the streets fucked up
Yea the streets fucked up
Yea ya ya

[Verse 1]
Eh I was born and raised in the USA
Where we see cops killing blacks on the news
Everyday and they do it like it’s ok
Like they know they going to get away
But I stop myself from thinking reckless
I just ignore it and pray
But I’m thinking is it ok
I should go against my mind
But you know me
I be acting crazy sometimes
Like how can how your brother of color
Talk to you like he your master
Or like how he watching black shit
Then just walk straight right past
I swear this world a disaster
I’m scared to see what’s next
People nowadays gets praised
For changing their sins
I just hope what you own now
Later on you won’t regret
We the land of the free be
Who you wanna be I guess

[Hook]
I don’t understand why the world so cold
World so cold
I’m still here trying to feed my baby
Baby ya
I’m just here trying to ensure that we make it
I can’t see why these niggas still hating
I guess cause the streets fucked up
Fucked up the streets fucked up
Yea the streets fucked up
Yah yah yea the streets fucked up
Fucked up fucked up
Yea the streets fucked up
Yea the streets fucked up
Yea ya ya

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to feel free when all my brothers in bars
Cause somebody that got caught said the dope was yours
Lord they giving my people life for a conspiracy charge
But they give a killer less to nat
Hate to see you rich and black
It’s crazy got me out here
Scared for my babies
Finally made it out the hood
But we still ain’t good I pray that all my people wake up
Squash all the hate up
Come together do better
Don’t settle go get your weight up
Only get one life to live do it right fill your plate up
Keep going until you see your dream when you wake up
It’s a long way up yea the streets fucked up
I know it get rough but fuck giving up

[Hook]
I don’t understand why the world so cold
World so cold
I’m still here trying to feed my baby
Baby ya
I’m just here trying to ensure that we make it
I can’t see why these niggas still hating
I guess cause the streets fucked up
Fucked up the streets fucked up
Yea the streets fucked up
Yah yah yea the streets fucked up
Fucked up fucked up
Yea the streets fucked up
Yea the streets fucked up
Yea ya ya
