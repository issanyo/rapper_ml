[Verse:]
Thugga!
Last of a dime breed of d trill niggas
Ain’t too many more real niggas
On d beat or in d street
On everythang, I killed niggas
I been a boss, I build niggas
Took-took plenty up out d hood
But you can’t feed em if they ain’t hungry
I’m a haugg nigga, misunderstood
Wuh-wuh-was broke without a pot to piss
Got on ma grind, till I got rich
H-how d hell you think I got dis?
I’m still on top, they ain’t got shit
In-independent, no help nigga
Di-did d album myself nigga
My label still gettin paper
Your label made you a chef nigga
On deep an head off, in dat drop head no strap nigga
Street niggas still fuck wit Thug
They know I ain’t just no rap nigga
I post it up in dat trap nigga
Still on hunid ain’t nothing changed
They see me out everywhere I go
You pussies out bleedin an constrained
Fuh-fuh-fuck fame don’t fuck wit me
Niggas still can’t fuck wit me
Since 17 I been a G, dat northside’s still stuck wit me
You punks ain’t ma pedigree
I seen em come an seen em go
Tryna keep up wid a haugg nigga
But they can’t survive when shit gets slow
Ne-never stoppin still want mo’
An dat foe foe of my foe foe
Ma lil niggas now grown killas
That’ll show up to yo front door
Fuh-fuck I got a front fo’
I live everythang I say mayne
You niggas pop til you get exposed
Lose yo change then lose yo fame
I don’t fuck wit no loose mayne
Still winnin ain’t neva endin
Live like a boss I’m still spendin
Ma smile face from the beginnin
Thugga!
