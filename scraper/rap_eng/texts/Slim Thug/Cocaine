[Hook x2: Pimp C]
Selling cocaine, coming down candy
When I see your bitch in the mall she call me daddy

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Alright, P Pimp in the trunk rode in neons
Old school steel blowing snow full of freon
I pissin on you peons, pussy niggas tryin to sue me
Fans watching my every move like they watching a movie
A American gangsta live in the flesh and the shit
I'm selling like blue magic. It's the best, yes
Pussy niggas best to best up they chest
Cause as soon as we catch em slipping we gon put that hoe to rest
I put that on the text, niggas think the boss is soft
Nigga gon make em bring the old boss out
No drought in my city, if you need it we got plenty
Call me Cocaine Tony, out the A, fuck women

[Verse 2: Boston Geroge]
You can catch me at the stinda steak, thirty dollar night
One more night before the first, that's a 2Pac type of night
This bitch bad, I shouldn't hit her. I'ma hit her ass tonight

I'm D-O-P-E, yeah that's me. Everybody know G sling that coco lean
Catch me, nigga whippin at my sister too
Talkin bout no Chevy when I say I win by sixty-two

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Draked up but I'm dripped out
Man I've been there for like twenty
Choppers, droppers, and boppers, playa I had plenty
Been heavy in these streets for damn near a couple decades
Hustler in the grinder man, all I do is get paid
All I do is get laid. Kirby see a dimes, man all my slab get sprayed
So candy paint and shine, got money on my mind
Got bread up in my brain, cash is all up in my conscious
Partner, I need it man. See me and Slim Thug run daily, sell drugs
Riding hard for our squads, fuck niggas catching slugs
Balls talking Bun B, ninety-eighters and them boys in blue
We ain't gots to tell ya what them boys'll do
