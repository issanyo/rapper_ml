Wicked
Ricky told ya
F*ck the world and everybody in it
Black on still independent
Been doing this shit for a minute
I’m still living life splendid
Boss life I’m in control
You can’t handle me like no hoe
How I’m a work hard and you get paid more
No that’s what a slave for
I’m a go and get my own money
I’m a keep shining on you stupid dummies
Signing for a check f*ck a check I work a little harder for my respect
I got it on my own masters
F*ck with my four five will blast ya
Everyday I’m higher than NASA
From H town to Nebraska
Bad bitches on my phone line
Go to sleep son it’s grown time
Three bad bitches just showed up
Straight to the hot tub it’s about to go up
That’s how a n*gga live life
F*ck getting married I don’t want a wife
I’m switching out every year new leather new dime I’m switching gears
Yeah I’m still climbing baby
H Town I know you see me shining baby
Look check out the diamonds baby the rolly rolly but it’s wrong timing baby
I look at my clock but I know you nosey hoes want to look at my watch
It don’t stop keep the Glock close by if the n*gga f*ck with me the n*gga gone die
I’m a mother f*cking real G
All the real n*ggas feel me
Bout twenty years I’m still me cut the braids let the grill go straight to sleep
I’m all about the hustle
Working in the gym getting muscle
Putting a lot of fat up on my brain
Bitches still coming up in the game thuggin'
