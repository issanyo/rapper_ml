We gon get it started, we gon get it crunk
We gon show them boyz they ain't messin with no punks

Here comes the hoggs erverybody get it started now

(Slim Thug)
I ain't got nothing to lose and everything to prove
To all ya'll playa hatin dudes who want to be in my shoes
Get out of line if you choose I make you look like fools
You can't duck these 1-2's I'm on my p's and q's
I move smooth like a big ship out on a cruise
Thats what a right foot everything I touch I choose
You been listening to too much rap that got ya confused
You playing hard but really you're a goody 2 shoes
You need to be yourself and quit trying so hard to amuse
All them fake cake dudes that you callin your crew
Why you tryin to be me, you need to try to be you
I ain't no ordinary rapper you can't do what I do

Hands down im the big boss of the town
You ain't know you better start asking around
I ran the game 7 years with the underground frown
And I'm still here at the top right now

(Hook -2)
We gon get it started, we gon get it crunk
We gon show them boyz they ain't messin with no punks
Its bout to go down, the boss run the town
Here comes the hoggs erverybody get it started now

(Slim Thug)
I'm a heavy weighter, a boss in the game
Just cuz you got a grill and braids dont mean we the same
Just cuz you rap dont mean we get paid the same thing
You think you getting what I'm getting your insane mayne
I'm in another lane whole other level
Thats what the right foot pushing on a phantom pedal
Thats why the watch got big rocks on the bezel
There's 19 carrots in my ear, you still buyin pebbles
I'm a big dawg you a lil pup
I had a mil before the deal yeah thats wassup
I ride around on rims cost more than your truck
Before you battle with tha boss get your hustle up
You a nobody, you ain't count to me
I'm 255 you about a ounce to me
Im slim thug
I make the whole world bounce to me
No matter how you added up you dont amount to me

(Hook -2)
We gon get it started, we gon get it crunk
We gon show them boyz they ain't messin with no punks
Its bout to go down, the boss run the town
Here comes the hoggs erverybody get it started now
