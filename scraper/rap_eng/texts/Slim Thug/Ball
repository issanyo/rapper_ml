[Hook: Slim Thug]
I'm addicted to shopping
Closet like a mall
Gimme this, gimme that I gotta have it all
Switch cars every season, winter spring or fall
I don't know about y'all but all i know how to do is ball
All i know how to do is ball
All i know how to do is ball
All i know how to do is ball
I don't know about y'all but all i know how to do is ball

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
I step up in my closet, it's looking like a mall
Louis this, Gucci that, yeah I got em all
Hermes belt, bitches think it stand for H-town
So many toys in my yard, it's a playground
So many tags, so much swag in these bags
I stay fresh on the daily, brand new like a newborn baby
From the phantom rode to that Bent
I done did that with no tint
Had to make sure your ho know it's me
I keep something over hunnid [?]
I'm posted up in that club, VIP on that wall
With a bunch of hoggs with money, and all we know is ball
Watch the money fall, look at them bottles pop
Check out that lot, look at them cars with the tops dropped

[Hook]

[Verse 2: M.U.G.]
Ball like I play for the Rockets
Bunch of cash in my pockets
All day on my block outside
Cause all I want is my profit
See that, if I want it
Best believe I'm gonna cop it
And my cup is that purple and what I'm smoking on is that toxic
Glass house so they seeing through
You ain't seeing me but I'm seeing you
Looking great, so these niggas hate
When they see me skating down the avenue
Roof gone, I just chunked the deuce
Hating me, what's the use?
Hit the light and get all the bitches
Cause I'm clean as fuck, and you dumpster [?]
Addicted to balling, and it's a habit I can't break
Fuck talking it ain't about a dollar, I stay on my cash chase
Better give me 50 feet, I gotta have space
Walk in and we VIP, so fuck you and your sad face

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Marcus Manchild]
Young nigga feeling like he better than whoever
That they got up, niggas not us
And i'm feeling at the top, ain't nobody top us
Ain't nobody touchin [?] out here who can stop us
And I'm feeling like Kobe, tell em get the shoes they can strap up
Hell yeah nigga back up
Who the little niggas in the club known just to act up
Pop the bottles yeah that's us
Right up in the mall and I'm feeling like the ball from the tipoff
Finna blow up, CD's finna ship off
And niggas on my dick til them mothafuckas get off
Cause these here real, nah these not ripoffs
Game time like the cover of a nigga's CD
And she got a boyfriend but a nigga can't beat me
And it's weed, women, liquor every time you see me out
Mothafuckas better know women 'round when you see me now
Dribble [?], dribble [?], hit a nigga mean with a crossover
Ball hard like a nigga got a crossover
Fuck rap [?], nigga crossover
Let me stop and reword
Peach Ciroc on reserve
We ballin [?] then I'm like the 97 speaker [??]
