You can ask the streets they can say I keep it 1000
I did it for my peeps everybody 1000
I'm all about my money man
You can tell by the way I'm ballin
Ok white lips it looks like a ghost crawled up
A 1000 pussy ballin

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm the realest nigga walking
I let this rap shit what ya’ll talking
You catch me catching counters
Till my city top off off
Not more chillin in that trap I might boss it
My dreams bigger ain’t trying to be just another nigga
Probably dead from another trigger
All the tough nigga dead
And they pin them on their waist
And I'm a hustler I'm just trying to
Get paid so that I can see another day
Those streets keep calling me back
But I'm too blessed to keep falling for that
Got niggas doing decades ain’t caught with shit
Cause they accidentally trusted a snitch
Then same story been told all over the globe
Niggas ain’t stick it to the cold
They some hoes but I'm a hold it down for my real niggas
All my thrill niggas keep that stack keep that real back

[Verse 2]
Chase my dreams now I'm a black king
My own boss may not work hard for everything
Stay clean live life to the fullest
Thank God everyday I ain’t catch none of them bullets
I came up the with sleek pop bottles with meesh
Then done number one songs with b now hey
Choppin it up with Jay-z now work out with
One beat got plenty love from my other brother
Now see a living legend in the city
Put that north on the map
No more falling for the trap
I'm trying to get that doctor dre pay
While not chasing a million
Hustlers ain’t got no ceiling
I want it all for my children
They never have to struggle like I struggled
Pops put the muscle and we ain’t got to double
I see my people get trouble trying to make it to the top
If you 1000 like me why not

[Verse 3]
I'm boosie bad ass bitch
And I'm so 1000
I got a big mansion
I came from public houses
I never had shit
I be stuntin and ballin
Can’t tell them all about it
I move so 100000 till I'm in the coffin shit
I remain a 1000 boosie thug life for real
These other niggas talking
I keep it real with niggas
I never steal jack my nigga
I'm going to ride man
I'm what you call a real stack
Tell me where the real at
Where do I want to your shooter ain’t your shooter
If he cross you I told you
Bitch I'm a 1000 I'm signing like the horse shoes
You was not 100 until I caught you boss move
Convo say red move call them racoons
I try to stay 1000 with the last dude
Shoot a thousand bet a thousand
Where your cash dudes
I hope all those boys get their dog food 1000
