[Intro: CyHi The Prynce]
Cyhi! Go GrizzYeah

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
I got a paintbrush that you can't touch
Went on a date with the devil but I paid dutch
And shawty wore a Prada dress
With a Kate Spades clutch
Mona Lisa, Melanie Fiona Features
Got her in the loft heavily on the reefer
Ran in her like a sneaker
Got her drinking margaritas
The pussy was picture perfect
Had her painted on the easel
Fly like an angel or an eagle on the needle
This how it woulda sound if it was a nigga in The Beatles
I'm from where they steal the speakers out your Regal
Man these young niggas evil shoot it out with the people
To my hood I'm like the tower to the people out in Pisa
You see this pyramid and say it's Illuminati
But not me, the first thing I think about is Egypt
Had your bitch doing kegels in the Begal
Went from "it was nice to meet you" to "taking off your top"
Ever since I met her at that coffee shop
She would come to the crib we would talk a lot
Listenin to Beethoven, Mozart and Bach
Now I'm kissin on her spot got her awfully hot
Sex is a art it's just like a Picas-
So don't do it for me do it for Basquiat

[Hook]
Ask me if I'm on the radio, I'm probably not
But I don't do it for the radio
I do this shit for Basquiat
So I don't care if you think my songs are hot or not
Cause I don't do this shit for y'all
I do this shit for Basquiat

[Verse 2]
I write my graffiti in Swahili
I don't follow, I'm not Phoebe
Fuck diabetes, I'ma die chic
That's the reason I'm dressed in this dashiki
Fly as Tuskegee, riding to my CD
Killin' your artists they ask me to sign a treaty
Edgar Allen, mixed with that nigga Idi
I mean can't nobody fuck with me in my city
When it comes to art, I'm the man bro
The fans follow me, everywhere my Van Gogh
Michelangelo, to your girl I'm Vermeer?
Shorty c'mere let me put these pearls in your ear
I been around the world in a year
I got the type of bars that could serve you a beer
And some Sake shots
Like the ones that you get at the hibachi spot
Don't get your bitch dug out I'm Bobby Cox
My flow'll bite your head off like Ozzy Oz
Born to be the greatest, so until my body rot
I'm the best overall, Osh Kosh Bigosh damn
Let the Gods be Gods
Edgar Degas, I defied the odds
And your flow is Bob Ross
And my shit is more like Basquiat

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Imagine Leonardo, in a Gallardo
I'm doin well I always be at the Fargo
Color purple got me feelin like Harpo
I'm like a art show, at the Louvre
Andy Warhol on your whore's wall
Shawty quit fuckin with them cornballs
I'm Rembrandt on tour y'all
Or Jean Michel without his shoes
I'm Kanye but not as rude
I'm Banksy on top of blues
I'm Kidult with a tude
On the fire extinguish I made the news
G.O.O.D. music, we here to push the culture
We don't do it for exposure
Never confuse a painting with a poster
I can't believe you would disrespect Basquiat

[Hook]
