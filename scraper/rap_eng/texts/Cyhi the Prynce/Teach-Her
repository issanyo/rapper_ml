[Hook]
You jerk off and pay hoes, pay hoes
You jerk off and pay hoes, pay hoes

[Verse 1]
I'm so focus on Ford
Bought a Honda when I could've bought a Porsche
And we ride deep in that bitch
Cuz everywhere we go we move on one accord
Yeah I lost some battles but I still won the war
And we tearing down goals like Shaquille on the court
Leather so soft shit feel like velour
While I'm ridin' through the city Coupe de vel on them Fords
All I ever wanted was a mic and a track
And I ended up with a deal and a tour
Yo own nigga will stick a knife in yo back
Niggas in the hood get killed over hoes
Shawty ima be a player 'till I kneel on the floor
And you wander why you niggas still poor

[Hook]
You jerk off and pay hoes, pay hoes
You jerk off and pay hoes, pay hoes
You jerk off and pay hoes, pay hoes
You jerk off and pay hoes, pay hoes

[Verse 2]
You in the club, tryna get a lapdance
I'm on the road, riding in a black van
Niggas in the hood say i cross over
Cuz I got more white than I black fans
Pimp hoes without a black hand
I'm the bomb to yall I'm Afghan
Kush smelling like a skunk and we sell it out the trunk
Got rich off the funk call us the Gap Band
They say it ain't tricking if you got it
But yo momma still living in the projects
And you got these bitches digging in ya pockets
You even spent the cash that was sittin' in ya closet
But I'm fresh like clothes coming out the dryer
Yo girl seen me and passed out like a flyer
If I want yo bitch I could buy her
But I wouldn't piss in her throat if her stomach was on fire
Choir

[Hook]
You jerk off and pay hoes, pay hoes
You jerk off and pay hoes, pay hoes
You jerk off and pay hoes, pay hoes
You jerk off and pay hoes, pay hoes
