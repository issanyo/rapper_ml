My life is so historical
You’re talking to the oracle
Am I the prince?
The question is rhetorical
People scream my name when I am riding down memorial
Black and orange Chevy like I am playing for the Orioles
Black and white bitch yeah that’s my little oreo
The Stone Mountain folk tale this is how the story go
I used to see my pastor preaching in his Giorgios
Then I thought about myself speaking in my sporty clothes
Talking about real life shit like the Maury show
Notebook full of pictures that’s my portfolio
Every time I quote a flow
I'm talking to your spirit, fuck around and catch the Holy Ghost
The rap Frederick Douglass
I am my own publicist
Just wrote a book trynna find someone to publish it
Black Panther, speaking out in public
Who never cut a brick bubbled it and doubled it
No feelings for a women I’m the wrong one to cuddle with
Only show love to the peoples that I struggle with
I’m doin well but my flows is the sickest
Plus my name ring bellz like it’s Christmas

[Hook]
My name ring bellz
Shawty ask around the ATL
My name ring bellz
From rice Street to Dekalb County Jail
My name ring bellz
Call me Prince Cyhi or Cydel

I ain't no rapper son living in Babylon
Go to the strip club just to get a stack of ones
Throw it on the baddest one, For a little cat or sum'n
Rappers ask me for weed but even if I had a blunt
I wouldn’t smoke it with you even if I had a ton
My name pulls strings like Lenny Kravitz thumb
Fuck a pen I use a magic wand
I am in the studio it’s usually where the magic it’s done
Yeah nigga bury me at Avalon
How would I travel on if I ain't even have a son
You hear the xylophones every time I growl up on
The microphone ears ringing like a dial phone
I am in the hood that you wouldn't walk a mile along
Fuck the palace, catch me in the battle zone
Automatic flamethrower watch me get my rattle on
The only thing left is ashes and a pile of bones
Yeah everybody knows me
You merc prince, nigga that’s like a trophy
Haters wanna ride on me like Yoshi
Cause I got they girl running routes like Stokely
I'm so popular Def Jam don't promote me
Ice Cube with the movies but I don’t know smoky
They say my flow is magic and trickery sales
My name rang louder than the liberty bell

My name ring bellz
Shawty ask around the ATL
My name ring bellz
From Rice Street to Dekalb County Jail
My name ring bellz
Call me Prince Cyhi or Cydel
