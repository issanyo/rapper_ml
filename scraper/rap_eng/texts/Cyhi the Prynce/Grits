[Intro]
I like my girls raised in the south, raised in the south
Girls raised in the south, raised in the south
Girls raised in the south, raised in the south, girl
Cyhi

[Verse 1]
Okay I met this girl from Alabama, out in Atlanta
She had more ass than I can handle
I said let's scramble, like Michael Vick and Cam Newton, or even Randall
Keep you running back like Eddie Campbell
Girl you cold blooded I can tell you're not a mammal
With two humps on your back looking like a camel
Before I wax that ass I'm a light some candles
You ain't fucking with no square do I look like a flannel
Don't like to gamble, but for you
I roll the dice, I met you down town
Right in front of slice
I had on my Yeezy 2s and a bunch of ice
You was in your business suit Condoleezza Rice

[Hook]
I like my girls raised in the south, raised in the south (Grits x4)
I like my girls raised in the south, raised in the south (Grits x4)
I like my girls raised in the south, raised in the south (Grits x4)
I like my girls raised in the south, raised in the south (Grits x4)
Shawty gonna let a nigga hit
I don't mean to be a freak
But I swear you thick as grits
Shawty gonna let a nigga hit
I don't mean to be a freak
But I swear you thick as grits

[Verse 2]
I met this girl said her name was Amber
Nice stance on her would've thought she was a dancer
And she said she studies nursing
Then she go to Clark Atlanta
I asked her age, she said 21 no Deion Sanders
Exchange numbers when she hit me but I'm on the way
She said she got some friends in town they from UGA
I got my boys let's make a movie girl no matinee
Good weed stay smokin' like a Chevrolet
You can tell she from the south by the way she speak
Plus she says she on them Z's but ain't nobody sleep
The whole world freaky girl and she for the dirty
She say meet me at the 12 at 11:30

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got this girl from Baton Rouge, her ass is huge
Seen me smoking on that passion fruit
While passing through
Pulled up on her, did what I had to do
Caught her walking outta Lenox
With a bag of tru's
I had to choose, so I told her that I had to know her
She went to school in Tennessee and just moved back to Georgia
She jumped inside my car and said nigga pass the doja
I might have to Amber Rose her booty fat as Lolas
And she kinda hippie but she not a smoker
Skin dark brown like the pennies in my loafers
She don't do no white she mix the Henny with the soda
Country ass bitch she put rims on her Corolla

[Hook]
