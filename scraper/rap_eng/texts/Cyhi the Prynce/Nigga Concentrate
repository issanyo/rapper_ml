[Intro: Kanye West & Scotty ATL]
You know it's hard when you're trying to do something different in the game, lot of times people don't accept it, but I rather have a slow grind where you build a really strong fanbase than just to bust out, have a hit single and then people don't remember you tomorrow

Yeah, I woke up feeling so good this morning, went to church yesterday
Preacher was like, you gotta survive through the tough times ya nahmtalmbout, it's just really, really gettin' prepared ya nahmsayin', for the big problems

[Verse 1: Scotty ATL]
Ain't no reason to be mad today, that's what I told myself
Can't wait to make it man I owe myself
Couldn've been like ya'll niggas, and sold myself
No homo, I blow myself
Affiliated with the whose who's in this shallow ass rap life
Where everybody claim that they bout the trap life
And we just seen you workin' at the Cookout on Moreland
And I ain't hatin' know we all want more man
Staying focused through the chaos, want my show line backed up, Junior Seau
Want my punchline backed up by the truth, tell them lying rappers stay out, Scotty got that shit that don't play out
Guess between I'm almost famous and I'm almost poor
I'm only lettin' bad bitches get this almond joy
Then you stab me in my back I'm like ah my boy
If it ain't moulah what you callin' me for?

[Chorus: Scotty ATL]
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate

[Verse 2: Scotty ATL]
I mean I'm focused on two things, loving myself gettin' money
Woke up nigga feelin' real sunny
I gotta watch you cloud ass niggas always tryna throw shade, no good news always lookin' grumpy
I'm tryna get outta debt, baby you fine I ain't payin' for sex, yeen even make the GF you X
And when I'm done listen ain't no Facetime or text, I'm like Jigga on to the next
Flex watch me stretch the dollar to the end of the week, been starvin' like Marvin mane I ain't eatin' in weeks
Been so much goin' on ain't been sleepin' in weeks, they told me seven days without prayer make you weak
My cousin man he crazy he been prayin' for a ki, I told him he don't need it but that nigga still proceed
I'm gettin' close chaos been breakin' out crazy, but my homeboy trill they be prayin' for me

[Chorus: Scotty ATL]
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
Yeah, Zone 6 nigga, Scotty what hannin', yeah
I'm chasin' every president on Mount Rushmore, went from bullet holes in my truck door
This street shit I wasn't cut for, I was sellin' like twenty pounds a week, shit I thought I was a druglord
Fuck boys always wanna ruin a nigga day, I just wanna wake up happy so I bought a crib in Lovejoy
I use to catch MARTA to wash dishes at this restaurant, I was the true definition of a busboy
Now I give you them same tokens, stay focused nigga that's today's slogan
I knew when I was drivin' that Bronco one day I'd be Range Rovin', feel good ridin' in luxury cars that ain't stolen
Had a dollar and a dream, now I'm J. Cole'in', blowin' trees wit all my necklaces on, I'm chain smokin'
My patnas pushin' keys for Gucci they Zaytoven, where the dope heads fiend for that boy like Frank Ocean
White or black you my nigga so how can we blame Hogan?
Scotty made me do this verse with just a days notice
I gotta dip and meet this freak bitch at the Waffle House
I told her meet me there cause they both stay open

[Chorus: Scotty ATL]
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate
I'm only focused on one thing
Nigga concentrate, nigga concentrate
I'm only focused on
