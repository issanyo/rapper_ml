[Verse 1: J Sutta]
Things never seem to be going my way
I no longer wanna be here to complain
I thought that I could weather the storm
And the rain keeps making me drown

[Pre-Chorus: J Sutta]
I feel like there's no air
I'm suffocating and it's not fair
Is anybody out there?
All I hear is silent noise

[Chorus: J Sutta]
I need a miracle
Cause I'm running from myself
I need a miracle
I'm a hazard caught in hell
And I'm running, running, running, running
Running from myself
I need a miracle
I'm a hazard caught in hell

[Verse 2: J Sutta]
I used to blow with the wind but there's no wind blowing
Built into a shelter of concrete and fear
I wanna break out but there's no way of knowing
If I'll discover just another river of tears

[Pre-Chorus: J Sutta]
I feel like there's no air
I'm suffocating and it's not fair
Is anybody out there?
All I hear is silent noise

[Chorus: J Sutta]
I need a miracle
Cause I'm running from myself
I need a miracle
I'm a hazard caught in hell
And I'm running, running, running, running
Running from myself
I need a miracle
I'm a hazard caught in hell

[Verse 3: CyHi Tha Prynce]
I need love like Cool J, good like Ducé
Love my girl last Tuesday, I want it bad but it's too late
Huh on the phone with the roommate, I heard she got a new bae
I called her a bitch, she said I ain't shit, and I'm like touché
Man they just cut the lights off
Damn I missed the due date
I fucked up my credit now I'm on my debit
Now I'm in debt, shit

[Pre-Chorus: J Sutta]
I feel like there's no air
I'm suffocating and it's not fair
Is anybody out there?
All I hear is silent noise

[Chorus: J Sutta]
I need a miracle
Cause I'm running from myself
I need a miracle
I'm a hazard caught in hell
And I'm running, running, running, running
Running from myself
I need a miracle
I'm a hazard caught in hell
