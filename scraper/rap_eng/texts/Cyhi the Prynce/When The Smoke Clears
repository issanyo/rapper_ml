[Verse 1]

I know these suckas had enough of me
Now I'm mad cause I told you not to fuck with me
Luckily, we ain't gotta be friends but we Siamese twins
So now you niggas stuck with me
Publicly, I don't do a lot of thuggery
Poppin' bubbly, I'm drinking wine rolling up a tree
It's going down like a submarine
I'm the Prince but tonight I'm trying to cut a queen
She said she's good with words I told her me too
Here's a verb and a noun, Shawty can you suck my thing?
She like Prince you so silly, I'm like no really
She like Oh Willy
Keep my green in a Philly, I call my dro Gillie
I was doing this back when I ain't have no deal-y
So if you say you don't like me, I really don't care
Just know that I ain't going nowhere

[Hook]
I'll be here when the smoke clears
When everybody else is gone
I'll be here when the smoke clears
Or when I finish inhaling this strong
You gon' have to drop a bomb on my city
Cause if God don't decide to come and get me
I'll be here when the smoke clears
Cause I ain't go nowhere else to go so
I'll be here when the smoke clears

[Verse 2]
I'm back, I think I left my car keys
Man these rappers out of style like tall tees
I'm a pitbull, you just a Maltese
No ghostwriter, nigga this is all me
Your girl damn near lost her mind when she saw me
I don't talk I let the trunk pull her like an RV
Prolly, cause I'm sitting on them tall feet
Big rims come up to Pau Gasol's knees
I'm your local dentist, you can't out floss me
I used to be a Po boy, now I'm getting Ross fees
I cross seas for my Kraft you gotta talk cheese
I'm the shit in the streets and on the blogs please
My name reign on the game like Seattle
I ride the beat like it came with a saddle
So for the next 4 years
The only way you won't hear CyHi The Prince if you ain't got both ears

[Hook]

I'll be here when the smoke clears

I'll be here when the smoke clears

I'll be here when the smoke clears
