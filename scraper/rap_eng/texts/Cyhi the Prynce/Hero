Cyhi Da Prynce:
Ya
I ain't gonna be here forever shawty
So, while I'm here we gonna celebrate
Its a celebration

Verse 1:
As I take the top of the Moscato off
Now I'm yelling mazeltov
Cuz I feel like I'm the shit yaganoff
Back to the future blessed the souls lost in the holocaust
I'f you feeling pain shawty I'm your Tylenol
Life is serene as a fiend when he nodding off
Especially when you in between something cotton soft
All my hoes above par, I play a lot of golf
Turn the green into cream, tartar sauce
Sorry ya'll if you think I'm fake, Hardy har
I know rappers who say they in the hood but they hardly are
We ain't in the same class, how can I copy ya'll?
I'm so hip hop, my DJ should be Marley Marl
Dog eat dog world everyday is Mardi Gras
Grab a barbie doll its time to jump the party off
Not only physically I'm literally fly
I live in the sky cuz heroes eventually die

Hook:
So tell my momma don't cry
Cuz heroes eventually die
Twist one lets get high
Cuz heroes eventually die
So put ya bottles in the sky
Cuz heroes eventually die
And we'll neva know why

Verse 2:
Yeah I'm living Martin Luther aspirations
Malcolm X's aggravation
Back for the lacerations
Soft for the act of hating
Smoke like I'm half jamaican
I'm fried like a pack of bacon
They want me like Papi Mason
What an imagination
On top and I graduated
I'm on top of the Appalachians
In a helicopter
On the phone with my travel agent
According to my calculations
9 times out of 10
We all die by assassination
So catch a bullet like Patrick Crayton
And pray your name last for the vast durations
Trying to be a hero in this backwards nation
Is like a P.O.W. trapped inside a Iraqi basement
So are you sure your ready for the accusations
And all the false allegations
So here fill out this application
But I hope you do know heroes eventually die

Hook:
So tell my momma don't cry
Cuz heroes eventually die
Twist one lets get high
Cuz heroes eventually die
So put ya bottles in the sky
Cuz heroes eventually die
And we'll neva know why
Heroes eventually die

Andre 3000:
Even when the sun goes down
Heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes why
Nothin' is fa sho
Nothin' is fa certain
Nothin' last forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I, Aquemini

Heroes eventually die
