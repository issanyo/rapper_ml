[Intro: CyHi The Prynce/Cydel Young]
Hey, ha ha
Hey Ezo, turn the volume up on my, uh
On my voice, real fast
Yo, yo, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
First he became a little older
Then became a smoker
Back when they called it doja
I was blowing with the soldiers
Top down on the six tre, I roll a
Blunt so cold, 'cause hitting better than Sosa
Be careful, it'll choke you
I be on that cushion like I'm sitting on a sofa
Everybody want to know what Prynce got the O's for
I tell 'em six hundred, I got it for the low, bro
Reggie used to look like we breaking down okra
Mary Jane, I knew she was a ho 'cause
I used to find at least one seed out the whole
But she let everybody hit, don't show a nigga no love
What you think I'm fucking with the dro for
Just the odor make you want to roll up
Then my folks introduced me to purp'
I got a Q [...] 'cause niggas knew me from work ?
I keep a bitch so I can stash it in [...]
Fuck with her I'ma have to send my goonies to merc
But really I ain't trying to beef
I'm at the crib getting high as a tree
Every time I

[Chorus] (x2)
(Twist kush, twist kush, twist kush, twist kush
Smoke
Now come and blow with me
Just a hoodlum, looking for a place to chief
And so we...)
Twist that kush and smoke

[Verse 2]
One night I walked in the club
With a brand new Lacoste with the Chucks
Straight looking like a boss in this mug
Trying to find a dark-skinned girl to toss in the tub
M4 had the Swishers, tossed him a dub
Then this girl came up, want to talk to a thug
She said, "Can I smoke with y'all?"
I said, "Yeah," so we both could talk
She said she just came down here from L.A
"And that shit that you're smoking on smells great"
Her body banging and her nails straight
So I had to pass it to her like Elway
Later on she was all up in Cydel's place
The same girl up in the club that give you niggas the stale face
She love it when the Caddy pick her up
She give me money 'cause her daddy rich as fuck
Plus she know how to...

[Chorus]
