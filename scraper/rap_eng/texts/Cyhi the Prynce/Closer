[Intro: Atlantic Starr & Jay-Z]
Oh, that's how long (that's how long)
That's how strong (that's how strong)
I'll be lovin' you, baby
T-to all my brothers, it ain't too late to come together
T-to all my brothers, it ain't too late to come together

[Verse 1]
Yeah, CyHi
Huh, this flow deserve a Kevin Liles
The shit can't help but touch you like a pedophile
My people say I stressed 'em out so I left the house
Now I'm running the streets with some Detroit players
Running laps around you niggas, I'm on my 7th mile
A special child with some things I need to reconcile
Cydel Young, got my rap name from sellin' loud
Cause Cyhi got a ring to it like a wedding vow
I grew up stealin' money out my momma purse
Now I'm buying everything I promised her
She don't want nothing else on this Earth but see her son in church
But just the night before, we was robbin' and runnin' work
Bought a onion first, sold nothing more than a hundred worth
But wear the under, the undershirt if you wanna lurk
Had money on my head, some niggas wanna murk
I used to rub my tummy like my stomach hurt
Cause I hate the place I'm in, I don't even feel safe with friends
My life is too stressful to bring a baby in
If you not 'bout the mission, can't be my lady then
Relationships can get kinda Rocky, my Adrian
Especially when it's your night at the Apollo
Huh, I might Basquiat the Picasso
Talkin' to Pablo, FaceTiming from Croatia
He said, "CyHi be patient, you know your time is getting..."

[Chorus: Atlantic Starr & Jay-Z]
Closer, well well
T-to all my brothers, it ain't too late to come together

[Verse 2]
Cyhi, huh
My partner robbed Peter 'cause he owe Paul
.38 snub, the revolver got a nose job
I used to talk to the plug long distance
Heard echoes cause they was listening, damn that was a close call
Can't doze off, the cousin of sleep is sure to get you
Bemoan a pistol, when I draw, you know it's stipple
Niggas switch sides, your partners'll "Above The Rim" you
Ever been in the middle of preying on some niggas, hoping the Lord forgive you?
If I don't go ten times platinum
I'm the closest thing to diamond with rhyming Swarovski crystals
Huh, I'm not here for the shits and giggles
Tell my sisters that I'm almost home, I hit a triple
Got caught for travelin' cause I was tryin' make it double
Stayed at the brickhouse but what's funny, the shit was stucco
Hurt to see my class walk, and I ain't get to graduate
My parents washed their hands with me like before you grab a plate
I was on punishment, still coming in after eight
The belt don't hurt no more, she can tell when she look at my face
I was a castaway, had to learn how to navigate
Through the alleyways then pull up on you the Cali' way
Huh, I did some shit I can't elaborate
Tried to serve some niggas I ain't know, that was my last mistake
And Satan, I know I'm one of your favorite soldiers
But I can't help you no more, cause me and Christ is getting...

[Chorus: Atlantic Starr & Jay-Z]
Closer, well well
T-to all my brothers, it ain't too late to come together
Closer than close
T-to all my brothers, it ain't too late to come together
Closer, well well
T-to all my brothers, it ain't too late to come together
Closer than close
T-to all my brothers, it ain't too late
