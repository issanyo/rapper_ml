[Verse 1]
What a day, man I’ll explain in a few
I’ll give you a list of bullshit that I done been through
Got pulled over harassed, by the tas, when I passed
Cause the window was down, and the police got a draft
Of the grass, searched the car and only found bags
Bad tags, rain drag, but that was only the half
Drove halfway down the block then I almost crashed
Cold thang, man I wasn’t even driving fast
But this lady I have passed had ass so I smashed
My bad, fucked up my brand new jag
Tried to play it all bad like I wasn’t even mad
But I was harder than the son at his deadbeat dad
I’m just tryina make a dollar out of 15 cents
But a buck 15 still can’t pay your rent
My baby mama tripping saying libby need diapers
And my brother stressed out cause he just got light

[Hook]
All day I’ve been grinding, with so much on my mind and
So ain’t worry bout shining, I wouldn’t even wait in the line and
I’m glad I made to the club, I almost didn’t make it
I’m glad I made it to the club, police tryna take me
I’m glad I made it to the club, I ain’t trippin on anything
I’m glad I made it to the club, fresh off probation
I’m glad I made it to the club

[Verse 2]
This for all my niggas getting rich in the trap
I ain’t getting head, but my bitch in my lap
Plus the cops in my rear view, but i gotta stay calm
Cause them lights make you freeze like the deer do
I write songs, sit back and drink a beer 2
Count money, even shed a tear or 2
But I got work in the car, search for the law
Can’t wait to hit the club and put some purp in the gar
Chilling in my section spitting church to a broad
Standing on the couch looking durk and gassard
With a bottle but I barely even drink it
Most of my niggas did it all from the pink…
White girl, or the green shit, I’m in the club with a bunch of delinquents
My regime thick, all of us straight chrome
But we came to celebrate for the niggas who just came home

[Hook] x2
All day I’ve been grinding, with so much on my mind and
So ain’t worry bout shining, I wouldn’t even wait in the line and
I’m glad I made to the club, I almost didn’t make it
I’m glad I made it to the club, police tryna take me
I’m glad I made it to the club, I ain’t trippin on anything
I’m glad I made it to the club, fresh off probation
I’m glad I made it to the club
