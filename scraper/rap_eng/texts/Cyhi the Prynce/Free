[Intro]
Free
Mic check, mic check, one-two, one-two
(Free) Yeah
In my life, I

[Verse 1]
I'm just a young man from Stone Mountain, Georgia
Failed every class, I flunked out before the
Eleventh grade, they told me I had a disorder
But every song he brew sound like a poem out the Torah
So I, learned to break a zone down to quarters
Had a crush on Crystal like Urkel had on Laura
I told her God is my attorney
I never go to court without my lawyer, huh
So hit me up when you (free)
I guess my decorum didn't match my aura
Shit, I'm just a bachelor that's tired of running back and forth
With different women, I had my fair share
If I retire, I'm still a Hall of Famer like Gale Sayers
Black bottle nigga, Prince of Bel-Air, huh
I need more than a bitch who sell hair
I'm talking healthcare, strip clubs is the new welfare
Bruh this pussy ain't (free)
So it's cheaper to keep her than run the street with ya people
Four deep in the Regal, smoking weed with a eagle
All we see is illegal, get a key from amigos
Make sure you keep it cerebral or
Lay underneath the cathedral
Smoke a leaf with Khalifa before I meet with the Reaper
I'ma kidnap a bird right after she let me freak her
She fell asleep in the fetal
The next morning I let her (free... in my life, I)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, feel like I'm being enslaved
Married to a bitch, it's hard being engaged
You spent your all on your gift but you work minimum wage
And she turn right back around and spit in your face
Huh, she tell you you ain't good enough
She tell you you ain't hood enough
She talking 'bout who she should have fucked, with
And now you tired of putting up (free)
With her shit so you decided to leave
Go fuck with them other niggas, them niggas not in my league
Less than a year later, I'm as hot as Belize
I'm no detective, but now she coppin' a plea
She wanna know if I'm good and how was my week
You don't need to ask unless you chopping a tree
It don't mean you smart 'cause you got a college degree
Really what I'm tryna say, I'm tired of putting music out for (free)
Love don't cost a thing
Try saying that to the girl you bought a ring
Curse a bitch out over the phone like Charlie Sheen
With collard greens in the kitchen with Paula Deen
Cause these rollies that we got aren't cheap
The oyster with the leather band cost three
And pretty girls want a nigga who got cheese
Shawty, I thought the best things in life were (free)

[Chorus]
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be, I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be, I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be, I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be, I just wanna be...

[Outro]
Free as the meal that a lady gets on the first date
Free as a bird that just left the nest for the first day
Free as the inmate who got out on parole from prison
Free as the air we breathe that could be the last breath given
Free as the extra .5 that my nigga gave me
For shopping with him for the last three years
Free as the Olive Garden breadsticks you take home and put in your fridge
Free as the neighborhood thot that gave every nigga the pussy
Free as the Chinese restaurant fortune cookies
Free as the peppermint, butterscotch and dum-dums you get at the bank
Free as the bootlegger that downloaded my album illegally, thanks
