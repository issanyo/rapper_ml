I’m back, my name should be spinal
Never passed the final
But they wonder how I sound so educated on these vynils
I, got my diploma from the corner
Where indictments come sooner than Oklahoma
Importing marijuana, I used to get my weed from portland
That’s why my license says, organ donor
I’m not a rapping ass nigga with poor persona
And for all the dead homies we pour coronas

And light blunts, for my niggas who got arrested
I ain’t talking yoga when I say they doing stretches
Putting money on they books just so they won’t feel neglected
I do this for the people, my message is majestic

Royalty like residuals, prince of the south
My favorite artist was mystical
I wrote poetry so rapping wasn’t that difficult
You heard I’m from Atlanta but I wasn’t the typical
Cause half of these niggas scared to be individuals
I give you respect and I expect to get the reciprocal

Haters I see you through my peripheral
It’s despicable, the way you judge me like municipal
Cause I got my checks up, I went and got physical, miserable
Now you niggas sour like some pickle juice
When I actual was the deal, you say everything is co sure
Royal flush, I think everything is poker

Cause I’m all about the money, I can’t play with you jokers
A child of god I did more preying that vultures
My folks said that’s off I had the haze for the smokers
45 on the table, the k was in the sofa, huh

And a couple throw aways, grind like a street skater on some roller blades
But let me take you back to CyHi before the braids
Smartest nigga in the class with the lowest grades
Yeah, broke folks supposed to hate, cause I’m getting capital
And you niggas lower case
I motivate for those who sold o’s
And never told when approached by popos

My cold flows controls the whole globe
No jerry curl but nigga my soul glows
Your favorite rapper went out of style with rose gold
Can’t be mad she on my dick, your ho chose like
