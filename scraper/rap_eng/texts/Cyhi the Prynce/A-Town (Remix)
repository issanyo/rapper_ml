[Intro: CyHi The Prince]
A-Town
CyHi, Travis Porter, B.o.B and my partner 2 Chainz

[Hook: Cyhi The Prince]
Okay, I represent for my city, hold it down for my town
I'm riding down I-20, hell yeah, east bound
Know real niggas in Bankhead, all the way to Stone Mountain
I'm throwing up the A-Town, throwing up the A-Town

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
Okay, I'm all about that red clay
From Stevenson back to West Lake
I got an old school that's red and grey
I put candy in it like eskay
Yeah, I don't mean sound cliché but I'm so G-A
Homie you can ask my DJ
Met the plug over there by the cheese cake
Don't think its sweet cause we serve it from the peach state
Me and Kanye riding down Redan
Throwing money out the roof, yelling out "Free Bandz!"
The motor in this bitch cost three grand
APD couldn't catch me with three hands
I'm back up on my A shit
That Big Boi Andre shit
That I'm Serious, that Trap or Die
Is the only thing on my playlist
I smoke swisher sweets when I chief blunts
Peters Street is where I eat lunch
Took your girl out to Lenox mall
She went downtown like Peidmont
Cause A-town my playground
I hate clowns that face frown
Cause it stay down from my waist down
Then I bus on em, Greyhound
Shawty yeen know your girl was a freak bitch
Today she let me hit for a 5 dollar bag of green
Now that's why I give her free dick

[Hook]

[Travis Porter]
Ok I'm sliding down on Lenox, keep evicting my crown
I hit the mall and I spend it, all this money I count
I remember the Poole Palace, I remember the Bounce
Throwing up the A-Town, throwing up the A-Town

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
80’s baby, Grady baby, my Auntie was a candy lady
And her baby had a baby, the A-town born and raised me
Southside, own that, Candler Road if I had to go back
Tony Wiggles on my throwback, had your feet on my door mat
Dirty South I know you heard about it, got loud I know you heard about it
Valley park I used to roll around, 2 Chainz with your girl around me
Two down, I'm too down, Kilo and Sammy Sam
Raheem and Outkast, Goodie Mob: ATL

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Riding in the Cutlass smoking on a black
Man it don't get more Decatur than that
What's better than that
Ain't nothing better than that
Ain't nothing better than that
See through the bullshit like cellophane wrap
All the slick talk we don't entertain that
Better take a step back
Last nigga came 'round here talking shit, left and never came back
Nigga I'm high, high like eagle pussy
Rolling up a heavyweight rap
My crib lay back, my chick lay back
My seat lay back, yeah everything match
Niggas tryna act brave, man we the home of that
You looking for whatever it's a zone for that
Getting paper ain't nothing wrong with that
Yeah we bout that coin like a laundromat
Maybe Candler Road make me feel like this
Or maybe Outkast make me feel like this
Put your A's up if you feel like this
We get the Georgia Dome jumping like we still got Vick
It's a dirty game and they scared of that
Blame it on the red and black
What better than that
Ain't nothing better than that
Ain't nothing better than that

[Hook]
