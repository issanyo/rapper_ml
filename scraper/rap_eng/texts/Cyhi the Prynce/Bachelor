[Hook]
From this whole world I tried to hide my face
It's the story of a bachelor
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place
It's just a story of a bachelor
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
The story of a bachelor
And I mess with memories I know so well
It's just a story of a bachelor

[Verse]
I wake up inside a California king
Brush my teeth and roll some California green
I wish I had a girl to cook a nigga dinner
But I don't, so I gotta order wings
It's hard to find a wife in my profession
In the strip club all night is my obsession
Half of the girls I used to like is baby mamas
Letting all them broke niggas pipe without protection
Man these hoes in my city don't change
They only fuck with niggas who get rid of those things
I can't see how they trick with no shame
I'd rather sit at the crib and play video games
I feel lonely even though I got a lot of women
People say they in love, but alot of y'all pretending
But for real I can't wait to get married
Somewhere in Paris and have alot of children but

[Verse]
I got a bachelor's degree
Cause I've been a bachelor at least
The last 7 years of my life
Shit I'm finna get my master's in a week
Huh, it's like I'm living with no emotions
I leave all my feelings below the trojan
She wanna be my girl but I just can't do it
So I'm home alone, chillin Macaulay Culkin
She living single, Queen Latifah
She said she went to high where her name is Khadija
She want a man that knows how to treat her
And she can't stand a guy who smoke a whole lot of reefer
So I already know I gotta leave her
Cause I got feelings for that pretty ho Keisha
Cause that's the love of my life
I sell it and I smoke it so I fell in love with it twice

[Hook]

[Outro]
From this whole world I tried to hide my face
But from this loneliness
