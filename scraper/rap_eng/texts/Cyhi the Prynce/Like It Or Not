[Intro]
CyHi!

[Verse 1]
It's been a hike to the top, feel like I'm writin' for Pac
Prynce uniting the block, plus I'm exiting to watch
Whether you like it or not, I'm a titan to God
Pull up my speakers, it's kicking like Tina and Ike in the car
And if I like it I swipe it, it's bought
This is what you get when you put me and ice in the pot
I murdered your flow and get away with it
Just give me a knife and a mop
My bitch looking better then yours, would you like if we swap?
I remember writin' letters to these chicks like
Circle you like me or not, now they like me a lot
And if your bitch fucked your partner, my nigga, your wife is a thot

[Hook]
Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not
I’ve been most likely to pop
Since we was motorbiking with Joc
Had to fight for my spot
President tint on the Benz, pull up to the light like I'm Barack
Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not
I’ve been most likely to pop
Since we was motorbiking with Joc
Had to fight for my spot
President tint on the Benz, pull up to the light like I'm Barack
Whether you like it or not

[Verse 2]
Boy, I was raised by them wolves
Boy, you was raised by a fox
Boy, you was raised by your granny
Boy, I was raised by my pops
But I got all of my game from a gangsta from out the Chi
Can't be fightin' with cops
Police always gon' be part of the streets
Whether you like it or not
So I tighten my plot
Had to switch up my look
Man this was just my Versailles
Y'all gonna make me tell on myself
Man this pro-black shit just a disguise
You niggas more flashy then bitches
I see y'all just like to get caught
Spend your nights on the cot
The judge give you life in the box

[Hook]
Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not
I’ve been most likely to pop
Since we was motorbiking with Joc
Had to fight for my spot
President tint on the Benz, pull up to the light like I'm Barack
Whether you like it or not
