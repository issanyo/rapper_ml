Verse 1: Cyhi The Prynce
Riding down 74
Listening to this heavenly flow
The devil telling me no
But that's just poison Bell Biv Devoe
Since you broke you should sell me your soul
Whoa
That's one hell of an ultimatum
This how me and the devil talk verbatim
Pacing back and forth off this Colt 45
Fell asleep outside of Lucas Oil Stadium
Then I woke up, still hungover silly
That's when I realize I got four ounces of purple with me
Now I'm back to running circles 'round the circle city
Hah
Just meet me outside of circle city

Verse 2: The Visionary and The Architect
Back in Indiana, the day I left to serve Uncle Sam
That was the day a Kentucky boy turned himself to man
[Droppin bombs like Larry Bird / You see me take flight]
French Licker, John Dillinger
Call me the French tickler
Bobby Knight choke a bitch, pull out the Big Stiffler
This some hoe down shit, we bout to throw down
Cult leader, Jim Jones- how it goes down
Beautiful rock and roll until my times done
Axl Rose, James Dean, American icon
Was 8 back in 82 and I was feeling that
Jack & Diane still pump that John Cougar Mellencamp

Verse 3: Louie Gonz
I just wanna be free
Taking shots Reggie Miller for 3
Spinning Jackson 5 records while I’m hitting my tree
I never back down
All the suckers play the background
They been sleeping why you think they call it naptown?
Spitting like a Mac round hands go up
Word To my cousin, You ran out your Andrew Luck
Need a chick bad as Vivica Fox
Hit it once disappear like Jimmy Hoffa I’m in love with the gwop
Every song I bless
Touch the fans like I’m Ron Artest
Keep the pace cause we all on next
Freddie Gibbs, Major Taylor
Brickyard is forever
The Keith Smart game winning shot that was the era
Indiana

Verse: Ranna Royce
I had to walk away from tornado
I got cheap wine from Skid Row
I’m numb to the games, your ways, the disrespect on foul reply
And right when I left I found out your side bitch had your 15th bay bay
Couldn’t compete with your toys, damn
Always runnin’ round with your boys, damn
I was the realest McCoy
I’m a savage litty, you below average Bizzy
What make a man fine ain’t the chain or the whip
It’s how he raise kids and treat his bitch
You said I was a prostitute got money for sucking dick
But what’s up with your bitch and her lingerie pics
Jessica’s a escort let’s call a spade a spade
He was the only shade in Miami Dade
He was the only shade in Miami Dade
Off to Indiana to band-aid betray

Verse: Faincarter
Workin’ this 9 to 5 spittin’ lines to meet the grail
Makin’ sure my fam is well niggas wanna see me fail
Feelin’ like I should be high tryna lift this life from hell
Got some fam in jail got a couple bros to bail
Money short nigga said he had me if I’m tryna sell
Take this kush my friend easy for a pusha man
Love for the hood that’s where I got my closest friends
They know we ride til’ we die nigga til the end
I pray to God now I’m walkin’ off these troubled waters
Talkin’ to the lord tryna make it when this life gets harder
I’d be a liar if I said that I was livin’ flawless
I’m always killin’ shit you can say I’m livin’ lawless
Attracted to the fast women troubled daughters
Only love Em’ if they fine with a right mind
Blessed to see a new day left the past behind
And while this money’s on the mind I’ll never pay Em’ mind
