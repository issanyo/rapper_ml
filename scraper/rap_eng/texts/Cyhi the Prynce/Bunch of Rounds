This afternoon my partner said he needa pack the bull
Grab my little thumper just in case I had to clap a goon
So ask me if I'm armed yes I keep it in the arm rest
I'm tryna live and see my son and he ain't even born yet
Warm tech sittin on my L A P in the L A C
Riding round with a whole pound of that LA weed
And im standing sharp please don't let that cannon spark
Shotgun tear your man apart can't let ya'll niggas John Elway me
I don't need 7 days to tell they weak
Fuck with the prince and it's hell they see
If god ever sent me the same as where givin hell AC
Got a dude in the red don't held they chief
And them little bitches gonna sell they cheek
And a nigga try to J A C K gon get C L A P D
Guns like LAPD when them shells spray he sleep
My niggas gon lay em flat like a HD TV
Fuck if he go tell DC that's if he L I V E
And a nigga T A K E something from me
You can betcha last pound we gon be

Riding round town with a buncha rounds (with a buncha rounds)
Looking for them niggas who robbed me (hey, hey, hey)(them niggas who robbed me)
I swear to god if I catch em with them clowns Ima lay em down (ima lay em down)
And ain't nobody out there can stop me (hey, hey, hey)(out there can stop me)

Now I'm creeping with the heater on me
Got extra clip and some reefer on me
Tryna stay focused on my jock (hey, hey)
And I ain't trying speak the homey
I just reached for them two inside and two visas on me?
Ima show these pussy niggas how I rock

3 deep in the mercury I try to chill but it urkin me
The nigga just took my work for me
Y'all woulda been but all murkin me
My niggas ready most certainly
That D rester they work for me
I pay them to do my dirt for me
All they wanted 500 that's a purpose g
That shows how much they worth to me
I can't believe they had the nerve
To rob me for a bag of purp
And 5 rags I had to splurge
So if I see 'em then catch n shoot em
Bustin the window that's for lootin
Then my bitch call my phone
Ask me what im doing I said Im
