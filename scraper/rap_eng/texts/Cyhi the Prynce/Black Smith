[Intro]
Don't stall me fat boy let's go
Uhhh
You know I got it got it
Cyhi

[Verse]
I've been a leader since the fetus
I'm giving y'all my thesis
Pittsburgh hat, and the "P" is for prestigious
I'm still undefeated, my haters is the sweetest
You must be from Sweden cuz you niggas kinda sweetish
I name my shotty Reeses, tear yo ass to pieces
Got my gun license so I'm the one who call polices
I don't mean to be facetious
You niggas is the weakest
My bitches be beyonces, yo bitches is Kelis'
Your stock is going down, and mine just increases
My scalp was kinda dry, I told yo bitch to grease it
I hit the lot to cop, you hit the lot to lease it
I gave my jeweler my wrist and told that nigga to freeze it
Yo chick was on my dick, she asked me could she see it
Left yo girl leaking like my song before I said release it
She blew me down on the couch, tried giving me the pussy but I told the bitch to keep it
You can ask Victoria this pimpin' ain't a secret
I'm the man now and people can't believe it
He said "What's the different between your Jesus piece and they pieces?"
At least 30 grand cock sucker believe it
