[Intro: CyHi The Prynce]
Nu Africa
Nu Africa
Yeah, CyHi!
Nu Africa, what we tell 'em?
Tell the motherland that a nigga comin' back for her
Nu Africa

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
Imagine if all the rappers were
To get with all the athletes or activists and actors for
A conference in Zaire to meet with all the ambassadors
In the motherland, tell 'em we comin' back for her
America know if we leave, it'd be a massacre
Zimbabwe would be full of, drug dealers and traffickers
Smokin' brassica, pick all the hoes from Magic up
Tell Tabitha, let a nigga Cleopatra her
So we can build a neighborhood out in Zambia
Tell Khaled to build another one in Tanzania
What if Jay and Bey went and bought some land in Egypt?
And Puffy put a strip of club off the sands of Kenya?
(Nu Africa) Since America can't stand to see us
Let's show 'em why you never bite the hand that feeds you
(Nu Africa) Call Akon to light the city up
Palace bought the compound in Libya
(Nu Africa) What if they had a Follie's in Nigeria?
A King of Diamonds in Liberia
Ballin' in Algeria, ain't gotta put my jewelry up
And if you black, you fit the criteria
(Nu Africa) We need Oprah to open up some more schools
Tell Michael Jordan we need some more shoes
(Nu Africa) Make sure every rapper still got Pro Tools
I'm just sayin', that'd be a bold move
Huh, make Obama the President
His daddy from Kenya so that make even better sense
Tell Morehouse to bring all the medicine
Botchey got a party out in Ghana, tell 'em let us in

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
Nu Africa
Nu Africa
Nu Africa
Tell the motherland that a nigga comin' back for her
Nu Africa
Nu Africa
Nu Africa
Tell the motherland that a nigga comin' back for her

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
I found utopia in Ethiopia
I gotta be with beautiful women, I got a phobia
But my side hoe from Morocco
And I got another chick in Nairobi cause
(Nu Africa) I look like Fela Kuti when I'm rollin' up
Prolly cause all the groupies show me love
(Nu Africa) I'm on my way down to Cape Town
They say that's a young nigga's playground
I met this chick from Mali in the party
She said she took a molly in the party
Man, I swear her titties were so big
I said, "Pardon me but who let Dolly in the party?"
Magic Johnson built some condos in the Congo
Kanye built a mall out in Senegal
Turn the Rwanda to a five star with the spa
Chillin' in Angola with a skinny little Guinea broad
Somewhere in her 20s and she get my little Jimmy hard
Cause her whole physique is unique
She petite plus her daddy is the king of Mozambique
When I met him, he had on that new Patek Phillipe
Took a seat, everything kosher like Jewish meat
My mystique, got her intrigued in disbelief
And she speak six different languages including Greek
And I love the way her booty cheeks move to the beat
I'm Prince Akeem, and you must be my queen-to-be
Just think of playin' golf off the Gulf of Guinea beach
Somewhere in Cameroon rollin' plenty tree
And a bunch of beef suya, yeah we don't do no Mickey D's

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
In Nu Africa
Nu Africa
Nu Africa
Tell the motherland that a nigga comin' back for her...
Tell the motherland that a nigga comin' back for her...

[Interlude: Ernestine Johnson]
She's the birthplace of all life
Where the son's of Abraham found wifes
The Babshibas, the Esthers, the Eves
Imagine queens who went to Spelman swimming in the Red Sea
Backstroking in two-piece bikinis off the strength of their degrees
Bodies handcrafted by the fingertips of God with the brains to match
Ain't no self-hate, ain't no slave trade, ain't no niggas to catch
Gold flowing through our veins like water flowing through the Nile
Walking through Jerusalem in Yeezy Boosts before the exile
Imagine August Wilson sitting on the same throne as Mansun Musa did
Writing stories of empowerment and self-righteousness for our kids
Imagine how we all suddenly come to our senses
Ain't no dick riding, ain't no marginalization, ain't no ridin' fences
Beaches filled with blue skies and white sand
We'd all have money and stock, all own a piece of the rock, a piece of the land
As the original people, unified we'd all stand
Imagine a place with all the creators of all the new waves stood in one space
I'm talkin' touch-tone phones, pressing combs, and potato chips
Box them bitches up and sell them to other nations and send them off in slave ships
Nu Africa

[Outro: CyHi The Prynce]
Tell the motherland that a nigga comin' back for her
"For he that is dead is free from sin..."
Romans 6:7
