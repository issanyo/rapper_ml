[Hook - Cyhi Da Prince]
I got ray ban vision, these ain’t no prescriptions
I see you haters coming niggers Don't Think that im slipping
I got ray ban vision, I wear when I’m whipping
I wear when I’m fucking all my women think I’m trippin
I got ray ban vision X 5
This how I’m living, the only time I’m looking you in the eye if we do in bussiness
I got ray ban vision

[Verse 1 : Donnis]
Hey I got Ray Ban vision, my bitches think they prescription
I’m lookin’ fly as fuck, like a GQ subscription
You can’t see behind them when niggas know that I’m quitin’
Cause I’m going on top sour diesel that’s as a lemon, lemon
No nigga, no this ain’t no Gucci shit, wearing with my Louie shit
And I got a groupie bitch, who wear him with her Gucci shit
She swear that I’m stupid rich cause I got all these ray ban flavors
But I favor my all black darth vader
I rock them when I’m blockin’ haters
In something tailored
Yes I’m looking dapper if you are inquiring
But don’t ask me where I get them, when your paid you acquire things
I spend high notes like a high school choir scenes
That had them admiring, thinking that their style needs firing, damn
I ain’t mean to get your fired off some fresh shit
But my collection’s quite impressive

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Pill]
I got my black shades on, Ray Ban on the side
Lets hit the bat cave home, Bruce Wayne when I ride
So those who robbing, you know I got the carbon
15 like half of 30 leave 'em slaughtered
Don’t mean to brag but my black shade’s fresher
Harder than then an all marble dresser
Yes sir, I am the professor the teacher of all cool shit
Bitches like he look like somebody I went to school with
Lenses, blackout, benze to crack house and everybody keep trying to buy ya like Shaq's house
Oki-ni, I put my foot out in this outfit, and Ray Bans is something I gotta leave the house with

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Danny Brown]
Ray ban vision, can you see me mami?
Making bitches out of paper like origami
Pussy on tsunami, they slaught a salami
The bitches pussy kicking like I heard a march of Nazi's
I get hand me down shirts from Liberace
You kiss bitches thats in to Bukake
And they modern day ferrow? Quick bow and arrows
That shoots sparrows in a 3 six barrels
Like we have your tongue when at time and yells at Christmas carol
I fuck bitches out of America Apparel
So they hit me to skeet skeet and get drugged out and your weed got seeds like a major league dugout
Smoke two blunts, drink a Pabst Blue Ribbon
Now she call that cab and her fucking panties missing
When she hit the door there was no kissing
Never see me again, I got ray ban vision!
