(Intro: Lloyd)
Never come
Tomorrow may never come
Never come
Tomorrow may never come
Never come
Tomorrow may never come
Never come
Tomorrow may never come

(Verse 1: Cyhi)
Baby girl you so precious
Like the diamonds in my gold necklace
I just want to take you out to lunch
Like yesterday before breakfast
I lead a life of a narcoleptic
But you can be the last girl I slept with
I've been dying for a chance to get you in this bed
Huh, I guess that's what you call a death wish
Condoms and no net flicks
In my condo we both naked
Then we wake up and go to Houston's
I laugh cause you thought we was spending go to Texas
Girl all I need is one day
A little limonade and some bombay
I don't do the boyfriend and girlfriend
So if you with me I call you my Beyonc√©
So don't play

(Hook: Lloyd)
Would you like to spend the night
Cause you don't wanna spend this night alone
Don't wanna live with regrets
Tomorrow may never come
Shawty let's get away
And live the life other women envy
We don't have time to waste
Tomorrow may never come
Never come
Tomorrow may never come
Never come
Tomorrow may never come

(Verse 2: CyHi)
But I bet you will
Got you feeling like you pop two pills
While the iPod playing DRU hill
When I'm 50 years old I hope I'm with you still
I wanna meet your mama and your daddy
I'mma tell 'em you the woman I'mma marry
I swear this is love at first sight
Even though we fucked on the first night
Huh, I like you even more let's get a room in Miami
So at night we see the shore
Fall asleep at four
I just wanna make love to you before I see the lord
Cause tomorrow ain't a promise
Shit the next hour ain't to be honest
You got me feeling like Christofer Columbus
Cause that how wet I get you when you cumming
So quit fronting

(Hook: Lloyd)
Would you like to spend the night
Cause you don't wanna spend this night alone
Don't wanna live with regrets
Tomorrow may never come
Shawty let's get away
And live the life other women envy
We don't have time to waste
Tomorrow may never come
Never come
Tomorrow may never come
Never come
Tomorrow may never come

(Verse 3: CyHi)
Girl listen up, I need you in my bed let's huddle up
Yeah,you ain't gotta go nowhere
Tell me what you need and I'mma make sure that it's here for you
Girl,just don't tease me
Cause baby tonight I
Put it in work you'll be running back

(Hook: Lloyd)
Would you like to spend the night
Cause you don't wanna spend this night alone
Don't wanna live with regrets
Tomorrow may never come
Shawty let's get away
And live the life other women envy
We don't have time to waste
Tomorrow may never come
Never come
Tomorrow may never come
Never come
Tomorrow may never come
Tomorrow may never come
