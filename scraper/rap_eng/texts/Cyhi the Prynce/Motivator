[Verse 1]
Cydel Young, my middle name Charles
They say what's going on
I say I really can't call
He say I know you still frontin'
Nigga work I said naw
The last time I did that a nigga ran off
Been a G got it from my grandpa
Mama told me life's short
Daddy told me stand tall
Panola Road all the way to Grand Park
I feel like I'm the best artist even though I can't draw
I'm balling even though I can't ball
Gave a bum a stack had him screaming "Randolph!"
I'm the prince of America worldwide boy you just the shit in yo area

[Hook]
Cause I touch what you never touch before
Seen what you never seen before
Woke up and him the blunt Cyhi
(I been at it for the past few days)
Cyhi

[Verse 2]
Blowing on some shit from Jamaica
Then I let it circulate like the Sunday paper
I'm a turtle on these hoes never been a bunny chaser
Throw a hundred on a stripper told her shake her money maker
Then I said that all you gon get but if you suck a good dick then I might accommodate ya
Slam her on the mat Undertaker
Now she want the dick way before she want a favor
I got a bunch of haters when you over qualified thats when niggas under rate ya
But I'm doing sold out shows jumping in the crowd Ron Artest on the Pacers

[Hook]
Cause I touch what you never touch before
Seen what you never seen before
Woke up and him the blunt Cyhi
