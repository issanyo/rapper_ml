[Verse 1]
I went to Redan, my cousin went to Washington
Abraham Lincoln is the truck that I was hopping in
When I used to see Duke from Boyz N Da Hood
We used to roll that George Bush, and breathe it like it's oxygen
Riding down Jimmy Carter in the Hemi Charger
In my Cabana shades, plus I had plenty pradas
Do I have to work any harder to get 20 dollars
For them Jacksons and them Grants we lost too many fathers
For the Ben Franks, they'll leave ya friends stank
Run up in banks, rob you with a thin shank
I feel like Al Gore when he lost the Florida state
Don't make me break into ya crib like the Watergate
Richard Nixon for his commission
Then jump off in my Gerald Ford and get to dippin'
I drown my feelings in the Remy, 'cause haters want to kill me
Like William McKinley, before I get a chance to turn the wheels on the Bentley
So that's why I keep the steel on the semi, But I got Will like Henry
I'm a author with a raw skill, but I never got shot like Garfield
From JFK to Hartsfield, I'm looking out the plane and the sky blue like a Tarheel
Believe what I'm saying's all real
I need to roll up, damn so can somebody call Bill
