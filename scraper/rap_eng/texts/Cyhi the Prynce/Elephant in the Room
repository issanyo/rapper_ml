[Intro]
Ayo CyHi what the fuck bro?
We've been waiting for your damn album for years man
What the fuck is Kanye doing
How about you get the fuck up and get something done
Drop that shit
If I were you I'd stop being a little bitch
Grab an AK, load that shit up, get out there and drag Kanye's ass out

[Sample]
Shake me down, not a lot of people left around
Who knows now, softly laying on the ground

[Verse 1]
Hey Ye, do you know what it feel like
To really be signed to you in real life?
Have you ever wrote a song
And you know you about to say something wrong but you still right?
I hope when I'm done that we still tight
But why wasn't I on the cover of the Complex?
You must've seen what I did to Funk Flex
Ya Sean my nigga but I'm coming after Sean next
Sit the fuck down Mr. West, I ain't done yet
While you're in your little Lambo on Sunset
I'm riding with a gun next to me
And it sounds like a little boy playing with a drum set
And it hold a hundred rounds
Cause when you come around niggas quick to gun you down
You'll be found on the other side of town somewhere, nigga
(Softly laying on the ground)
Get the fuck up

[Hook]
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground
In my life

[Verse 2]
Welcome to Def Jam
OK, everybody on the fucking floor
You and you by the double doors
That was three shots and it holds 15
So that means I got a dozen more
Now that everybody's on one accord
I'ma tell you what I'm coming for
I want a new million dollar deal on my pub
In the pretty brick house like the Commodores
Oh now everybody's getting kidnapped
Take you back to your crib while your kids nap
And if your wife walk in, start screaming in my ear
Then the bitch is getting bitch slapped
I'ma make it look like a mishap
Cut the TV on so they won't hear this shit clap
And I've got two guns, they gon' think it's suicide
Cause you shot yourself with this strap
(What the fuck CyHi what are you doing this for?)
Cause nobody want to listen to the kid rap
OK, my nigga Pusha shit snap
Nah I'm lying man that shit's crap
OK, Teyana got a fat ass
But she won't let nobody in the clique tap
And there ain't gon' be no new Yeezy album
Cause he in the the trunk with his mouth taped and his wrists wrapped
*mumbling* Shut the fuck up nigga! Shut the fuck up!

[Hook]
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground
In my life

*Alarm blaring*
