[Verse 1: The World Famous Tony Williams]
Well I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams]
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you

[Verse 2: The World Famous Tony Williams]
And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
Losing control, yeah I'm all over the place

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams]
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

[Bridge: The World Famous Tony Williams]
When you started out with nothing
And you found that you're a self-made man
And your friends, they all come crawling
Slap you on your back, and say, "Please"
They say, "Please," they say, "Please," they say, "Please"
Please
They say, "Please," they say, "Please," they say, "Please"

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
Excuse me, I don't usually hit the movies
On a first date, I think we went and saw Lucy
I heard you're lookin' for a free man
By the way, how you fit in them blue jeans?
I'm 'bout to have a drink, would you like to par-tay?
Chardonnay, let your hair down after a hard day
Now I'm stuck between a rock and a soft place
Which means I'm tryna park my car in your garage space
You gon' really make me beg for it?
You must want me to spend some bread for it
This money, you don't know how many people bled for it
You didn't just see me hit the stage and break a leg for it
So until your head against the headboard
Or I'm dead bored and I can export
Your pretty ass to the closest airport
Plain and simple, treat me like I'm in the Air Force

[Verse 4: The World Famous Tony Williams]
Tryna make some sense of it all
But I can see that it make no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?
'Cause I don't think that I can take any more

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams]
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

[Bridge: The World Famous Tony Williams]
When you started out with nothing
And you found that you're a self-made man
Your friends, they all come crawling
Slap you on your back, and say, "Please"
They say, "Please," they say, "Please," they say, "Please"
Please
They say, "Please," they say, "Please," they say, "Please"

[Verse 5: The World Famous Tony Williams]
Alright
Well I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And now I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams]
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle, stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle with you
And I'm so stuck
Stuck in the middle with you
