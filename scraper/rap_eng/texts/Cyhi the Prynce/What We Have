[Hook: LTD]
What we have, never felt
Never felt
Never felt
Never felt
What we have, never felt
Have never felt
Have never felt
What we have is much more than they can see

[Verse]
Teamwork make the dream work
A lot of you niggas ain't ever seen work
I was sellin' kush before you niggas ever seen purp
Back when Meech had 17 for a clean shirt
Growin' up I used to sing in church
Before my homies start fightin' I would try to intervene first
A lot of people try to bring dirt, but
(What we have is much more than they can see)
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Can't be fallin' out over hoes, all these bitches fuckin'
For a dollar, it hurts but they're like rental cars
They build enterprises off the ballers with the biggest budget
My OG had them things whiter than Mr. Hudson
He lost 20 bricks to the police like it was nothin'
He said, "I ain't your average nigga hustlin'"
(What we have is much more than they can see)
Get 'em in by the truckload
That's why it's hard for me to trust folks
Cause they're cutthroat, he said at sixteen
I was worth a mil', lil' nigga if you must know
But keep that on the hush though
And don't be the club makin' it rain on these slut hoes
I said, "Why?", he said, "What we.."
(What we have is much more than they can see)
So shoutout to the niggas that I hustle with
On the phone, I swear they'll never call you by your government
We hold a covenant from back when I was thuggin' it
Out there in the trap tryna pay my mother's rent
One day the SWAT kicked in the door and found some supplements
But for some reason, the police let us flush the shit
We was trippin cause...
(What we have is much more than they can see)
But I still got expedited for some chargers down in Soperton
Cause I had a girl who went to school at Georgia Southern then
Never laid up so she knew that I was smugglin'
And back then I had a .22 that I was cuddlin'
But even though we're not together
Don't let them hoes get to you, they sour like amaretto
Cause me and you know that
(What we have is much more than they can see)
I love you, shawty
