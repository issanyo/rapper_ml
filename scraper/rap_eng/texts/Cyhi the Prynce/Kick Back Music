[Verse One]
They might get you high, they might get you drunk
Talking slick to me, nigga that might get you jumped
If you owe us money, that might get you trunked
Baby if you suck some dick, that might get you pumps
That might get you staying a couple nights up at the Trump
If you don't like me smoking skunk, that might get you dumped
I'm all about the bread, bagels and croissants
Shit I might just go to Turks and Caicos for a month
I'm screaming Je m'appelle Cydel, keep some kale for sale
Make a grand in a flash, where the hell is Melle Mel
Rappers hear my flows and jack it like Pelle Pelles
All my bitches wear Chanel and their pussy barely smells
How you doin? Very well, screwing every gal
I damn near see, my life is a fairy tale
Got niggas in every jail, hand cocked to make a statement
Dont make me take your date to my place and make a lake
Okay you gon' need some weed, you gon' need Swishers
You gon' need some rubbers, and you gon' need some liquor
You gon' need some bad bitches, I prefer some strippers
Three of em is friends, two of em is sisters
Then you play some of this
