[Verse 1]
I'm on the come up, jump up, I pick my gun up
Joe Jackson with trapping, I beat the sun up
That's just how I was brung up, whippings, I got a bunch of
On Memorial Drive in the Cutlass, I'm bumping YoungBloodZ (U Way!)
Feel like I'm hitchhiking, every flow is a thumbs up
I give you my spirit 'til all my niggas wrists is uncuffed
It's hard to celebrate Christmas as a black man
Cause like ornaments on trees, that's just how we was hung up
One love, MTV, this is unplugged
Stacking this cheese reminds me of momma's lasagna
From crafting double entendres, the child of Coleman and Tanya
Just a gap-toothed genius, word to my cousin Jelanda, uh
Twist up this ganja 'til I go over yonder
They say I got too much will like 24s on Hondas
I been sponsored off white since 'Ye lived in the 'Go
Y'all niggas slow if that just dawned on you like kitchen soap

[Hook]
God bless your heart, huh
God bless your heart, yeah, huh
God bless your heart, yeah
Be thankful His mercy let us say all these precious thoughts
Yeah, God bless your heart

[Verse 2]
I came, I saw, I conquered like Caesar said
"No time for leisure", that's what the overachiever says
"Cydel, you a Piru", that's what your teacher spread
I wrote everything in red cause that's what Jesus said
My thesis read
My partner fed fish scale to the whole village for a piece of bread
"Matthew was 14", that's what the preacher pled
"Just a nigga in a Coupe", that's what Yeezus said
Until you, reach the feds, huh
Cause them boys will hide your ass like an Easter egg
Niggas wet you while you sleeping, you just pee'd the bed
Afeni son on Death Row, I'ma die behind these bars
Cause when I put the pen to pad, they should make the pen my pad
Put this shit on wax, how I used to dip and dab
Flipping halves, I like my cars and my women fast
Bitches love my presence cause I got the gift of gab
My matriarch low mileage, high APR
I need my lady just like a brand new Mercedes car, huh
It's 'bout your lineage, show 'em I'm not your guinea pig
Might fuck a midget and have twins, I'm tryna have too many kids
Not out of wedlock, never had a scared pops
Worked three jobs, overtime at the sweatshop
I thought I was a good kid, well I guess not
A hot boy, juvenile was my next stop
Breaking through people windows stealing desktops
Just a bunch of big dummies, Lamont's the red fox
And I had a redbone who thought that she was headstrong
Had to yolk the bitch up cause she was egged on
But the best friend had me calling collect home
And she fucked my best partner knowing she dead wrong
It ain't her fault I was misguided and lead on
Huh, but I ain't tripping

[Hook]
God bless your heart, huh
God bless your heart, yeah, huh
God bless your heart, yeah
Be thankful His mercy let us say all these precious thoughts
God bless your heart
