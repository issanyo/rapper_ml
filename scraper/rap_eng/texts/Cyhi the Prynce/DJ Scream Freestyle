Yeah sa ha
Yo I’m not a rap nigga I’m more like a counselor
For the school of hardknock so I know I found them
Grew up selling drugs but these ain’t over no counter
I pull up pistol in the club like we know the bounces
Like when my partner had the charger
Two tone and I was still trappin off the boost phone
I kept a cutie in book bag I sold the ounce by the lockers
That’s what I call a school zone
I was known for the sticky pair of familiar
Dropped out but I was never really a failure
Around some niggas who sold Izzi Agnazior
Ha ha shout out to Sidney Australia
But now I just to spit rhymes
Still just the same hustler I just switched rhymes
I made it big time so I gotta get mines
Cause I told my sister no more standing
In the wait line
