[Chorus: Iliana Eve]

It's been a long damn time since I came around
It's been a long damn time but I'm back in town
Said it'd be a while and it would last
But babe it already has past
It's been a long damn time since I saw your face
It's been a long damn time since my heart began to race
It's been a long damn time but that's okay
It's been a long damn time without you my babe
It's been a long damn time since I came around
It's been a long damn time but I'm back in town
Said it'd be a while and it would last
But babe it already has past
It's been a long damn time since I saw your face
It's been a long damn time since my heart began to race
It's been a long damn time but that's okay
It's been a long damn time without you my babe

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
In due time, I won’t  be sleeping on this futon
Going grocery shopping with these coupons
We used to shoe shine to get a few dimes
Never had shit so I blew mines
The sky’s grey like poupon
We wishing it was two suns
Telling me it’s from Arizona
I did that shit too son
Cuz I could barely pay for school lunch
It’s the mind state of the crime rate
Nobody told you you and the devil had a blind date
On the road to success you gotta read what the signs say
Shit I had to grind late for this prime steak
I went from riding dirty in the Hyundai
Through the PJs now it’s PJs with Kanye
Now I see style in Paris with Jay-Z and Beyonce
Hoping one day I would meet my fiancee

[Chorus: Iliana Eve, Aesja & Lil J Sean]
It's been a long damn time since I came around
It's been a long damn time but I'm back in town
Said it'd be a while and it would last
But babe it already has past
It's been a long damn time since I saw your face
It's been a long damn time since my heart began to race
It's been a long damn time but that's okay
It's been a long damn time without you my babe
Everything I've dreamt is coming into fruition
Hoping always wishing
Hoping one day we can turn all of our dreams into fruition
Cause it's so it's
Worth it (x3)
(Mmm)
Hoping always wishing
Hoping one day we can turn all of our dreams into fruition
Cause it's Worth it (x3)
And I'm not even done with my mission
So it's worth everything that I've given

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
God, I’ve been waiting on my blessings
Too often now I’m stressing
My apartment now is threatening
To put me out if I ain’t caught up by the 7th
My mama got me talking to the reverend
She told him that the police caught me with a weapon
I went to court and they charged me with possession
I got a question, was all this just a lesson
And when are you gonna send my partner home from the Department of Corrections
The judge gave him like a century
You said only you could judge us
Then why are we all in the penitentiary
But since we outnumbered so immensely
Like the word dinner, we just trying to make 'N's meet
Our scars is more than skin deep
Cuz Santa don’t come down our chimney
So, please forgive me

[Chorus]
