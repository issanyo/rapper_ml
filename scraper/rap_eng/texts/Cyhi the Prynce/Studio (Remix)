[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

[Verse: CyHi The Prynce]
Throw your A's up, peace down, I-20, eastbound
All I smoke is loud, if we talkin' 'bout how my trees sound
Darris pull the track up, TEC gon' lay the beat down
I was on my groove 'til Molly said "Let's eat now"
Last week I ran game on her, girl who had a frame on her
I gave her my number, she don't call? Shame on her
Plus she ain't have no ring on her, my partner said
"CyHi, you got some weed? Cause you always got some stankonia"
That's when I got that call, like somebody tryna pull a prank on yah
She's like "I wanna smoke, but all I got is some bad purp"
This the chick from last week, I guess I'm not a bad flirt
Meet me outside of Patchwork, but I gotta stop by Zack's first
Shawty wanna fuck Mr. Never-Had-A-Wack verse
Say she passin' Leather Street, cruisin' like Penelope
Sound like my favorite melody, fidelity, no jealousy
So if you keep it cool, we as smooth as Raphael Saadiq
This what I tell a freak
