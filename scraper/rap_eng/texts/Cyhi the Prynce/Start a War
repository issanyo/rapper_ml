[Hook x2]
Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

[Verse 1]
Tears on my face, blood on my LeBrons
I'm sitting here with my partna in my arms
I knew that he could possibly be gone
Cause I said his name and I didn't get a response
We was like brothers, used to hang tight
We used to wear the same clothes, rode the same bike
We even fuck the same hoes, we was the same height
I played sports, he was more into the gang life
He kept a 40 cal, extended clip
He started stealing cars, always had different whips
Shawty kept it 100, never flipped the script
But I never seen the demons he was dealing with
Shit happened so fast
All I heard were shots and broke glass
I just remember being so mad
But I had to play dead until them niggas drove past

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Word on the street, he knew this bird name Patrice
He sold a brother a couple pounds of herb and a key
I know where he stay, where he serve, where he be
Swerved hit the curb then a blur, he asleep
My partna was a well known finesser
But it hurt my heart to see him pale on a stretcher
Grabbed the chopper, got the shells off the dresser
I'm stressin' cause I've never felt this type of pressure
My nigga hit 'em with the dummy brick special
It's only so long before they gon' catch ya
Do I admit what my partna did was disrespectful
Do I make it 'bout revenge, either way I feel regretful
So we jumped inside my homeboy Caprice
Riding strapped to the home of Patrice
If we get caught I know we gone up the creek
It's well known in the streets when it's on then it's beef
It's hard to sleep when

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The perfect time to do a crime is when the night fall
Before we hit the corner, turn the lights off
Plastic gloves, make sure all the burners wiped off
And we killing any witnesses if they might talk
That's when I started second guessing
Is this all just a lesson?
I do music for a living shawty this ain't my profession
And all my niggas killers, so who am I impressin'?
I feel like Tre in the back of that Impala
The closer we get, my decision gettin' harder
Do I listen to my friends or do I listen to my father
Cause I know them niggas gon' be coming back tomorrow

[Outro]
