[Intro: Blac Youngsta]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Aw yeah, we 'bout to fuck 'em up
Nigga, right now

[Verse 1: Blac Youngsta]
I ain't miss shit when I lost you
Know it cost a grip for a walkthrough
Shut up lil' bitch, I taught you
Ho, you ain't shit when I knocked you
Suck my stick when I rock you
Run up on me, I'ma pop you
You ain't even see when I spot you
Major labels they'll block you

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
Ight bitch, it's ight fuck nigga
It's ight lil' whore
It's ight yeah
I'm ight, I'm good
They ight, we hood
We ight, bitch
Ight, gang gang

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
I might hit the club, I might throw a bunch of ones
You and your lil' nigga, y'all some motherfuckin' boys
When I'm in the city, I be in them fuckin' foreigns (toy)
I can't shop with you 'cause I know your fuckin' source (source)
You gotta rewind that beat back (wind)
You gotta be fine, I beat that (fine)
You gotta be mine if I eat that (mine)
You gotta recline with the seat back
I'm a solider like C Murder
I'ma have to bring Master P back
Can't sell dope where you sleep at
Can't fuck hoes, where ya creep at
Laws in the hood, right where I be at
Don't go to the store, that's where they deep at
Right there by the dope, that's where I keep that
Big 'ole MAC-11, knock your feet back

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
Ight bitch, it's ight fuck nigga
It's ight lil' whore
It's ight yeah
I'm ight, I'm good
They ight, we hood
We ight, bitch
Ight, gang gang

[Verse 3: Lil Pump]
I love ratchet hoes, bust it open on the floor
Stripper bitches at the door, gave your momma Adderall (whoa)
It's ight, told that bitch buy her own flight
But she kept askin' for lies (lies)
Told that bitch she look alright (woo, woo)
I don't want you, only want your sister (sister)
She got big titties and her booty gettin' thicker (thicker)
I sip so much lean, I think I'ma break my liver (goddamn)
Every time I pop a molly, I start doin' sit-ups (molly)
Okay, I'm sippin' drank on the plane (drank, drank)
I just made your wife give top to the gang (gang, gang)
I got my grill from Johnny Dang (Johnny)
I just had a orgy last night in (um) Ukraine

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
Ight bitch, it's ight fuck nigga
It's ight lil' whore
It's ight yeah
I'm ight, I'm good
They ight, we hood
We ight, bitch
Ight, gang gang

[Verse 4: Blac Youngsta]
I dumped my old bitch (she old bitch)
I got a new bitch (she so new)
I get foolish, I get throat, I might use it (I get loose)
I'm on that shoot 'em up, bang bang, make the news shit (Channel 2)
I'm on that come through gangbang, on your crew shit
F-fuck nigga, you loose lips
I don't even think youâ€™ll shoot shit (nope)
When you saw the op, you ain't do shit
I'ma go and cop brand new shit
You know in my city, I'm what New York mean to Biggie (New York)
You know in my city
They be treatin' me like P. Diddy (Memphis)

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
Ight bitch, it's ight fuck nigga
It's ight lil' whore
It's ight yeah
I'm ight, I'm good
They ight, we hood
We ight, bitch
Ight, gang gang
