[Intro]
Yeah (I know what you're looking for)
Huh

[Chorus]
Looking for love, looking for love, looking for love, girl
It's not in the club, not in the club, not in the club, girl
Someone to trust, someone to trust, someone to trust, girl
I know what you're looking for
Yeah, looking for love, looking for love, looking for love, girl
It's not in the club, not in the club, not in the club, girl
Someone to trust, someone to trust, someone to trust, girl
I know what you're looking for

[Verse 1]
Yeah, CyHi
Someone that's yours, open the doors, help with the chores
Money galore, entrepreneur, pull up in the Porsche (skrr, skrr, skrr)
Spend guap at the stores, bring you flowers and more, girl
I know what you're looking for
Yo, hah, you want a man who can provide
Look you in your eyes, tell you no lies
Cook on the side in the hood with his guys
Then go to church, pay his offerings and tithes
Still hit the club, throw some ones into the sky
If that's what you want, come and jump in the ride
He gon' make sure you got somewhere to live
He gon' make sure you got something to drive
And I, wanna be that person for you
You don't know how long I've been searching for you
Hah, I can't wait to put some purses on you, girl
I know what you're looking for
Cause I heard that you're

[Chorus]
Looking for love, looking for love, looking for love, girl
It's not in the club, not in the club, not in the club, girl
Someone to trust, someone to trust, someone to trust, girl
I know what you're looking for
Yeah, looking for love, looking for love, looking for love, girl
It's not in the club, not in the club, not in the club, girl
Someone to trust, someone to trust, someone to trust, girl
I know what you're looking for

[Verse 2]
Yeah, CyHi
Stay on his grind but still give you time
You run through his mind, huh
Buy you something that shines, bar number 9
Run with the iron (pah, pah pah, pah)
One of a kind, you want Jesus and Obama combined, girl
(I know what you're looking for) Hahaha
Huh, she just wants somebody that street, but still got class
Still got cash, most of her friends said it will not last
Tryna go legit but he still got bags
Who still love you in your Jill Scott swag?
I said I like her thick but she still got mad
I said I like her thick but she still got mad
That type that's gon' tell you you beautiful
You deal with headaches on the usual
All that's gon' take is one manicure
And no, I'm not talking about cuticles
I know all these things might be new to you
Like leaving gifts in your cubicle
I know what you're looking for
Huh, and I've seen you be jumpin' through hula-hoops

[Chorus]
Looking for love, looking for love, looking for love, girl
It's not in the club, not in the club, not in the club, girl
Someone to trust, someone to trust, someone to trust, girl
I know what you're looking for
Yeah, looking for love, looking for love, looking for love, girl
It's not in the club, not in the club, not in the club, girl
Someone to trust, someone to trust, someone to trust, girl
I know what you're looking for

[Outro]
You're not mine, I'm not yours either
Though we both have strong desires
First step's marriage, then having babies
Love me now and forever, my lady
You're not mine, I'm not yours either
Though we both have strong desires
First step's marriage, then having babies
Love me now and forever, my lady
What you're looking for
I know what you're looking for, for
What you're looking for
I know what you're looking for, for
What you're looking for
I know what you're looking for, for
What you're looking for
I know what you're looking for
