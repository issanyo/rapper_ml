[Hook]
I’m rolling up the strong
I’m rolling up the strong
I’m rolling up the strong
I’m rolling up the strong

[Bridge]
I’m feeling the strength of the strong as I roll up
You can smell it in the hall with the door shut
I’m in a non-smoking room with the goons smoking fumes
If they hit me with the fine then so what
Make bread from the O's that's a doughnut
Shawty say she wanna split, that's a toe touch
No stems, no seeds I break up weed like a relationship with no trust
Smoke bud

[Hook]
I’m rolling up the strong
I’m rolling up the strong
I’m rolling up the strong
I’m rolling up the strong

[Bridge]
I’m feeling the strength of the strong as I roll up
You can smell it in the hall with the door shut
I’m in a non-smoking room with the goons smoking fumes
If they hit me with the fine then so what
Make bread from the O's that's a doughnut
Shawty say she wanna split, that's a toe touch
No stems, no seeds I break up weed like a relationship with no trust
Smoke bud

[Verse 1]
Keep them trees like I'm out in Cali
Cheech & Chong Maui Wowie
Kush sticky like duct tape
Shouts out to my partner Alley
They know my name when I walk in Bally's
Hollywood like my girl that's in the Valley
My outfit cost me a whole thang
Naw nigga I ain't talking Sally
I'm talking about that green shit, eyes low Yao Ming shit
Ion do no beans nor that clean or that lean shit
Fuck nigga I mean this, my routes are always scenic
I'm riding around with a lot of pounds just touched down from Phoenix
And they going for 800, half a pound 8 onions
250 for the cutie, can't tell me I ain't bunking
And that's when this chick that I be screwing called my cellphone and asked me what I'm doing
Bitch

[Hook]
I’m rolling up the strong
I’m rolling up the strong
I’m rolling up the strong
I’m rolling up the strong
