[intro - Miloh Smith]
[?] 5%
Fuck it
[?], that whole Ezekiel bible verse
Was epic right?
But that shit's not real, at all
I'm gonna fuck some shit up right now

[Verse 1 - Miloh Smith]
[?] in my rifle
People you have been lied to
Imma make a new testament and imma edit shit and imma put it in the Bible
How you like that?
Well you're probably gonna hate this
But that man is a racist, and a rapist, tryna lock me in a basement
Oh safe ass nigga won't say shit
And I hate when I say my prayers, I gotta say [?] like motherfucker how dare you
Strong mind wanna [?] weak nigga I scare you
Well I'd rather just burn forever
Because the Earth don't turn for us, [?]
Tryna make it to heaven I've been through hell and back
And black skin done burned enough
See... cause it don't mean a thing to us
But they still let it be so
Cause they know
Yeah, who want it?

[Verse 2 - Cyhi]
Cyhi
I spell church with a y
Fuck a shirt and a tie
The only person that I listen to is God
Cause he's always the first to reply
I give sight to the blind
Here nigga put this dirt in your eyes
I'm hotter than [?]
[?] submerged in the fire
I know that every book was written by man
And every man on this earth that's alive
Has at least committed one sin
So how'd you know that them verses wasn't lies
Man you niggas are commercialized
Fuck with me in a [?]
An imposter could be mad in the streets
Cause dope money paid a third of your ties
When I jump imma try and go Abraham
Flow like water never gave a damn
Let the church say amen
Niggas talking shit I'm gonna have to lay hands
Y'all must be Muslims
Cause you haters stay praying
On a nigga's downfall
To the point you can't stand
Up at me and them suckas be like Cyhi's like king Tut to me
Wasn't he the nigga with the puffy cheeks that suddenly shot at living luxury
Them be the same ones that had busted me
Most people kill over gluttony
Growing up in this life of sin
I swear this shit done corrupted me, damn

[Verse 3 - Marian Mereba]
Namesake of a saint with the thoughts of a rebel
I called bluff on the book as a kid
Metaphor [?] in my head like a general
Generally vexed by the verses they read
Asked my brother why
He said you'd better never ever ever ever ask again
Then I heard the angels cry
Then I haven't heard 'em since
Skinny legs bending down on ashen knees
Hands stuck together like the leaves onto the trees
I was just a rethink praying to the sky like sky, tell me why?
I don't believe in a garden
I don't X7
Since every mama and papa
I don't believe in a garden, no no
So I set the leaves on fire
I don't believe in your garden
