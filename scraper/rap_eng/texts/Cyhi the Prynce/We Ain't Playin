[Intro]

[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
Yeah, now follow me, follow me I'm coming up heavy in the game
Puffing that master kush, we trying to come up with new ways to get paid
I'm sipping that remy, I'm chilling, I'm killing in Cleveland, all day
Ain't too many niggas I fuck with, male bonding is gay
A nigga be extra fly, I bet you've never seen this before
Me and my niggas done already hit it, you trying to wife that ho
We're making it hard for haters to breathe
We living the life they wish they could
We pulling their hoes with ease
I'm bending them corners around my hood
Strap on deck, I had to say it slow
Just so you know if niggas are tripping
I'm loading the clip in, and sending you bitches down below
Yo, got a son now so am I playing, hell no!
Niggas is some hoes, I'm here to show you how It's supposed to go

[Hook: Chip Tha Ripper] (x2)
We ain't playing, we ain't playing
We ain't playing, nigga we ain't playing
We ain't playing, we ain't playing, we could do something
Nigga, what you wanna do? Nigga, What? do something!
Nigga, what you wanna do? Nigga, What?

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
I bet you never seen a real Cleveland nigga like this
I got them Charlie's angels hoes, them bad bitches hitting licks
Got that kush up in this cigarello
Keep it cool, yeah I keep it mellow
Couple overseas hoes, you keep bitches from the ghetto
Got that Louis on me like you didn't know, I stay Prada'd up
Tell them sexy hoes that they gotta fuck or they time is up
I ain't never satisfied, no matter what, it's not enough
Bought my mom a black mercedes, coming up, we had it rough
Niggas hating on me, cause I got a little fame
These women don't wanna fuck me, they wanna fuck my name
Fuck it, even exchange, as long as they give me brain
Now they boyfriends mad, they're going against the grain
2Pac was right, niggas is some bitches crying over bitches
So ridiculous, now I gotta go, and get this fo
And hit this ho ass nigga in his dome for trynna threaten me
I'll be a shooting star, if I ever become a celebrity

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
Nigga we don't give 2 fucks
Get a nigga killed for 2 bucks and some new chucks
You talking about who? You gon' do what?
Strap on my ankle if the jeans I'm wearing bootcut
Chicken in the chevy, I got it suped-up
Check the blue guts, swear that bitch is too plush
Met a new slut, with a cute butt
She said her man don't like me, I said who does?
Cause niggas hate you more than the Ku Klux
Just keep my name out your mouth, I'm not a toothbrush
Or get my left foot up ya ass, Sir Lucious
And if them tools bust, my pistol's smoking like Snoop bus

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 4: Malik Yusef]
Word smith, Malik Yusef
GOOD Music's live ass angel of death
Sit back and listen to God's tool bust
There's a reason I got y'all on this school bus
Help you out with your learning children
I'm so GOOD I once pulled out a building out of a burning building
Showtime gigolo's, we don't give a fuck but we got it for sell
Permeate your molecular structure, we got it for sell
See we want you to feel, what you bumping like we wrote it in braille
Hot stamp in my passport, I got it in hell
Been through it, tag on my luggage
Your girl want me tag her cause I'm thuggish
Bone cause I'm ruggish

[Hook] (x2)
