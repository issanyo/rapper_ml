A-T-L-A-N-T-A, G-A 4-0-4
Yeah, No Gimmicks
Let me switch the flow up on em' real quick

[Verse 1: Matt Citron]
Give it right back, hit em with the rhythm like that
We were living tryna give 'em life back
Couldn't feel 'em why's that
Wise move, not a tycoon
But we gotta get it busy like that
We were chilling right back in the building
When they gonna bill 'em for the feeling that he's giving spilling tight raps
He been killing, I know, ride slow
Made her balance on a very tightrope
If you want it, come and get it, hit the function 'cuz you know we gotta feel it like that
We been hooping, alley-ooping, triple-double, never shy but we drilling like that
Drop the top, go chips and guac', we dip the whip and hit road no ceiling like that
No limit in the all black tinted, when they all clap living like a villain, might laugh
On Ponce rolling in the bucket Honda
Windows down who gave a fuck about him
Run 'n shoot, we had the hot sauce still got the
Same sauce but now I'm cooking Ramen
Looking different when we hit the city
Candy color couping got em sitting pretty
Look at City add the R-O-N
Know we had the broads
You just borrowed them in the

[Chorus: Matt Citron]
404, Zone 6, East Side shit
West Side Bankhead
Summertime came quick
College Park
Running through Decatur
On the same shit
Just a different day
We been livin' in the A
404, Zone 6, East Side shit
West Side Bankhead
Summertime came quick
College Park
Running through Decatur
On the same shit
Just a different day
We been livin' in the A

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
Yeah, I'm so Moreland Ave, Georgia Bap
Box Chevy, Water raft
My life was headed towards the trap
Pounds of lettuce, quarter halves
When ya selling better know ya math
Never let 'em catch ya sleeping, can't afford a nap
12 pulled me over for my autograph
But I didn't have nothing, thank the Lord for that
Midway Park, I was quarterback
Dropped out of school, I was bored with that
My principal said I'd be a drug dealer and I wasn't gon' be nothing more than that
I ignored his ass, grabbed a scale
At 16, a nigga had bags to sell
Couldn't get nothing to eat, mad as hell
All I knew was keep the heat and don't tattle-tale
Had a bad little bitch who went to Avondale
Most of 'em wish they still had Cydel
Eastside nigga really had them belles
Riding down Glenwood in the black Chevelle
Broke a nail while I was trying to fill the mack with shells
'Cuz I heard they looking for me and I'm not prepared
And y'all know where I'm at, All you gotta do is add the L
(Nigga)

[Chorus: Matt Citron]
404, Zone 6, East Side shit
West Side Bankhead
Summertime came quick
College Park
Running through Decatur
On the same shit
Just a different day
We been livin' in the A
404, Zone 6, East Side shit
West Side Bankhead
Summertime came quick
College Park
Running through Decatur
On the same shit
Just a different day
We been livin' in the A

[Verse 3: Money Makin' Nique]
The coupe skate, she like, "How he ride?"
Since 107.9 was 97.5
I had a squad of niggas, me and several guys
I had a spot, can't discuss what we'd sell inside
But lemme take it further, Brown Middle
Since Forces, slouch socks, sour skittles
Romona Debreaux with that ass it was swole
Coco Bruva was the nigga with the team that's at home
Been off 20 since Fabo got beamed up
Went with Toomp niece, I used to drive his truck
He don't even know, man, I wish I could go
Take Greenbriar pictures, Stop at Eddies' for the golds
The best place that ever did it, the best place that's gon' do it
The rest ain't ever live it, the rest ain't goin' through it
In this bitch feeling like Chris Wallace
Big Poppa, I get dollars
9-6 is my Impala
On that Hennessy, finna hit Onyx
Finna hit miss, she said the clit throbbing
Oh this yours bro, I'm a bitch robber
Nigga mad 'cuz his chick ridin'
He can't go shit, he gon' sit cryin'
Niggas cap, I just sit quiet
Crown Vic's flyin'
Sellin wic and buyin'

[Chorus: Matt Citron]
404 Zone 6 East Side shit
West Side Bankhead
Summertime came quick
College Park
Running through Decatur
On the same shit
Just a different day
We been livin' in the A
404 Zone 6 East Side shit
West Side Bankhead
Summertime came quick
College Park
Running through Decatur
On the same shit
Just a different day
We been livin' in the A
