Drop it to the floor, make that ass shake
Make the ground move, that's a ass quake
Drop it to the floor, make that ass shake
Make the ground move, that's a ass quake
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, make that ass shake
D-drop it to the floor, make that ass shake
Make the ground move, that's a ass quake

[Verse 1]
Work work, make that ass sweat
From my aspect, you ass is yo assets
I put a thousand on it I can fuck, that's an ass bet
If you was from Mexico bitch you would be a Aztec
I got her pussy poppin' on the carpet
Bitch I'm super fresh I'm straight up out the Farmer's Market
Put that ass in reverse and come and parallel park it
With yo dark skinned friend I call ya caramel and chocolate
Put 'em together that's a Twix
C.K.P., T.I.G. that's the clique
You see this charm around my neck, that's a brick
Have a baby by The Prince and you won't have to ask for WIC so

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I fucked every stripper plus the house mom
I had groupies way before I dropped an album
I'm probably wit ya ex like Malcolm
But I pull out when I'm finna bust, that's the outcome
Gon' make that ass shake, bitch my cash straight
But if trickin' was a race I'd be in last place
Ask my last date, dropped her off on Cascade
She say I ain't a real nigga but her titties and her ass fake
Pull off on her all she seen was "antique" on my 'Lac plate
Bout to go and holla at my Scottish bitch from Bathgate
Hit the club and ball for thirty minutes that's a fast break
Girl I done had a bunch of bad bitches you can ask 'Ye
