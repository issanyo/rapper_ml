[Verse 1]
All I wanna say is I adore you
I swear to God, I'd do anything for you
If you need an engineer, I'll record you
I go to school to be a lawyer just to court you
Shit, it's hard bein' faithful for a black guy
Especially when you're signed to a rap god
But for you I'll go to church and get baptized
Girl your body drive me crazy like a cab ride in Manhattan
I wanna do everything your man hasn't
Me without you, I just can't imagine
I thought that this was more than a friendship
You're worth more than any girl I've ever been with
When you said you wasn't ready for a new guy
Like a baby with his shoes untied, I didn't trip
All I wanted was some time alone
I'm not a fossil so I was never tryna bone
You probably took my number out your phone
So since you like music, I thought that I should write a song
I ain't here to talk about who right or wrong
I'm used to bein' single, baby girl, I feel right at home
Let's get a townhouse in Maryland, I know that we American
But I wish we could live our life in Rome
Paris is even better, so Coretta
I'm finna make a little cheddar, I just wanna know if we can

[Hook]
(Spend it together)
They say time is money so can we (spend it together)
(I wanna get together and spend it with you)
Monday through Sunday I wanna (spend it together)
I'm goin' on a vacation where the skies are sunny so can we (spend it together)
If God said I only had a day to live, I wanna (spend it with you)

[Verse 2]
I just wanna see you in Celine
Yeah I'm a Prynce but I see you as a queen
Pick a team, it's like I'm D Wade and you Lebron
I'm your partner, I just wanna see you with a ring
I see you in my dreams
Either you a stranger or my wife, shit, I don't see you in between
Cause to call yourself a girlfriend is such an injustice
That's just another name for a girl you hit the club with
My parents still together so I really know what love is
No baby mama but I love kids
If treatin' you with respect is a crime
Then I'll do any amount of time that the judge give
I'd rather be aside you
Some niggas rather be in Club LIV
Cause I don't know how long God gon' let a thug live
Before the rest of my time here I wish that we could

[Hook]
