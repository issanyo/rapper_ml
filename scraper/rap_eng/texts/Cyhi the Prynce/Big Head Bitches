[Hook x4]
You can get fucked, big head bitches

[Verse 1]
Yea that bitch fine and all
But she a headache with no Tylenol
I done hung up on some hoes y'all niggas been dying to call
Got a record label full of bitches nigga don't make me sign yo broad
I told her I give her the world, if she take off her clothes
So I went to Office Depot and bought that bitch a globe
Girl I wonder where you'll be when I turn 64
You'll probably still be selling pussy, and I'll be rich and old
Soo, you need to change yo attitude
Cause my worst bitch as bad as you
So get on this bed and get latitude
Come see what this pillow top mattress do
And yo pussy better smell like passion fruit
And when you see me in the streets, don't be acting rude
Cause I'm Alaskan cool, I'll ride by you like Baton Rouge
But I can't front shawty that ass is huge
I'll still jump in that pussy bitch and act a fool cause

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
Ol' bougie ass, big ol' booty ass
The type of chick to watch a flick and talk through the movie ass
Ol' choosy ass, Ruby Tuesday ass
I would never house a ho, that's Doogie ass
It's truly sad, we call you to thrab
The waitress said "What would you like to eat" she said "I'll do the crab"
Her plate was 70 bucks, we can all do the math
I got 30 dollars left, I'm calling you a cab
So she can't say I ain't keep it 100
Chieffin' on chronic, I don't skeet in hoes stomachs
I just keep these hoes coming
I got Polo on in England, cause I'm meetin' the Lauren London
I get red kisses, leave they legs twitching
Cause of curiosity, left her with a dead kitten
This song is dedicated to the big head bitches
Cause y'all remind me of my dick head bitches
