[Verse 1]
Uh I’m feeling way richer than yesterday
Trying to shout but get squeaky
Black suit how about an escalade
Yea I don’t drive so gucci
I got a bad bitch as my passenger
As another passenger
She lean over and pass me ma
Seat belt Godman she so thoughtful
(?) she ought to
Because I could help ass through law school
She got a good head on her shoulders
I feel everyday she gets colder
Got a head wind and she ain’t sober
Have a few shots she asking for my mosa
Then we did those yogas until I hosed her down
And it goes down man and in time man I love her
Almost as much as this money

[Hook]
Its money on my telephone line (Errday)
And tell my (Hello)
Money !!
It’s money on the telephone line (Errday)
And tell my (Hello)
Money !!

[Verse 2]
Yea I’m feeling a whole other n***a from yesterday
Yea last night was just peachy I’m about to get
Higher than a n***a got yesterday
So how can that n***a reach me ? Naah !
Got a new bad bitch as my passenger
Girlfriends say I ain’t having her
But I hold her and told her that i conquer
You must not know the shit that we on
It’s like an escapade up in Rome
And I’m talking about my home let alone
Probably be alone in the day
Buy a clone go to space
Now she wants to fuck for a place
Not me no way
But I will take this preacher man
These back seat and these speakers
When I’m on my shit and I’m high shit
But I was still on time for my maiden

[Hook]
Its money on my telephone line (Errday)
And tell my (Hello)
Money !!
It’s money on the telephone line (Errday)
And tell my (Hello)
Money !!

[Verse 3]
I had a magnum two tone
Black and grey poop on
It must have been like 8 degrees
And I’m round round with the roof gone
Got a trap by the blue palm
So I always have two phones
Boast phones in the metro
For those two you can’t do wrong
For the week before I met a new Jones
With some boots on in a blue thong
With those low riders I walk beside her
But what I gotta do to take you home
When I put my last name on the tombstone
She said little boy I’m too grown but
If you give me your number
I’ll think about calling
I said ok don’t take too long
For the next couple days she has been
Stuck in my head like a new song
But I figure that she ain’t gonna call
We a young person gotta move on
But out the blue she text a n***a like
What you doing with a sexy picture
Just left the crib about to hit 20
I’m gonna come and get sexy with you
She hit me back like L.O.L
I said see me thug dress here
And to celebrate I lid up a fresh air
This is back in 04 when My T-shirt use to be an XL
And right before I could exhale
I got to churp her my next tape

[Hook]
Its money on my telephone line (Errday)
And tell my (Hello)
Money !!
It’s money on the telephone line (Errday)
And tell my (Hello)
Money !!
It’s money on the telephone line (Yea yea)
It’s money on the telephone line (Yea yea)
Every day and tell my, Hello, Money !!
