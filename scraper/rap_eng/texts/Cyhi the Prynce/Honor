[Hook: Laws & Cyhi Da Prynce]
(It's my honor)
To be in front of crowds and everybody knows your name
(It's my honor)
To see the people smile, bringin' good music back to the game
(It's my honor)
I wanna see the fans go wild
I wanna see your hands in the clouds
(It's my honor)
I wanna see the fans go wild
(It's my honor)
I wanna see your hands in the clouds
(It's my honor)

[Verse 1: Cyhi Da Prynce]
Hello everybody, can I kick a flow or two?
You wanna hear some shit I wrote inside the vocal booth?
Went from a local booth, trappin' off of my Mobile Boost
From being booed in Brooklyn, now the screams uncontrollable
I am so the truth with these notable quotables
But they could've have bought anybody to come do a show for you
Not like I’m the only artist that the promoter knew
They asked me how did I get noticed when no one promoted you, ha
Man, the fans is who I owe it to, fans win the show for you
Layin' in Japan, well the plan is to be global, fool
When you universal, it's hard for these record executives not to Tommy Mottola you
It's cool when they tell me ain’t nobody cold as you
They'll even load a gun and go to war for you
I told Mercedes, when you in a Benz
It's always a Toyota Corolla that wanna come total you
So my appearance is a humblin' experience
Put the album out myself, shorty, I don’t need a clearance
Tryna to block my route, dawg, we call that interference
Ain’t nothin' like the feelin' of a crowd when they cheerin'
Shouts out to all the baby mommas and they children
All the hip-hoppers and the ballers in the building (ha)
So thanks for lettin' me live my dreams
So before I leave the stage, shorty, let me hear you scream

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Laws]
Two finger salute
It's hard to see the sun from the booth
I used to daydream, visions of me sittin' in the coupe
So they bout to call me Twista how I'm rippin' off the roof
We're no longer in Kansas
How do you paint when there's no longer a canvas?
The fans make it for you when they puttin' they hands up
I'm feelin' so high, the camera can't even pan up
So stand up, put your hands up if I'm next up
I don't use gimmicks, I don't play dress up, so 'fess up
There's a reason they think of me as Superman
I've got these people singin' my praises like Luther Van
We go to studios just to play who's a fan
I got these other rappers shoppin' for some movin' vans
I'm havin' dreams of the days when I used to plan
Don't wanna be a star, but I could use the fans
Yeah, yeah, you need to give me that
I'm 'bout to give you hits till you wanna hit me back
And from the jump, I had power like Mario
'Cause I'm the triple crown and they the merry-go-round
And it don't get better than some high school losers
With your stickers on the stereos now
They the ones that take a close look
They keep writing 'Laws' all up in they notebook
