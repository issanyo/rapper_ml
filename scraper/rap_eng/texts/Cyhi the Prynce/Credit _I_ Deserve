[Intro]
TEC, my mic on?
I hear y'all talkin', trust me, I do

[Verse 1]
My verses deserve hearses
One doctor, two nurses and four surgeons
Catch me wherever the perps purchase
Nobody sick as him and I'm speakin' in third person
If I ain't in your top five
You're deaf or you're cock-eyed
But soon as my stock rise you niggas gon' cock-ride
Who you know got ties with gangstas that chop pies
I swear these are not lies
My verses'll scare you if I took you counter-clockwise
Every cut that I produced deserves peroxide
People tried to bring me down but I got pride
So I keep my head up like I'm tryna catch a pop fly
If Pac cried it would've sounded like this
I don't know nobody holdin' down their town like this
A young prince who came from the underground like this
Since the Dungeon, nigga, you ain't heard a sound like this
So if rap had a Beacon score, I could prolly lease a boat
With no money down, and I got the cheapest note
Haters wanna see you broke, they ask me how I'm doin'
I say I'm fine, I'm like a Puerto Rican ho
Oh, I'm a reservoir for metaphors
I'm so off the chain, I can't even pedal forward
Off a mixtape, I've done been on several tours
Cause I'm hot as Ecuador every time I press record
Fuck a catchy chorus, nigga I drop bars
My shit tight like the backseat of a cop car
I got a debit card full of money
But it's funny cause y'all still won't give me the credit I deserve

[Hook]
For every line, every word
Give me the credit I deserve
For educating niggas on the curb
Give me the credit I deserve
I made it out the streets from sellin' pounds of the herb
Give me the credit I deserve
I can't believe these people got the nerve to not
Give me the credit I deserve

[Verse 2]
Rappers should be nervous cause me with a pen is scary
Cause I bust like that pistol you tend to carry
Whatever cemetery they put me in when I'm buried
Just know I came out on top, missionary
Dropped jewels like my chain broke, and I spit canaries
I'm in the '74 Chevy like I'm friends with Larry
Hoover then they try to do you, but I keep a Ruger
This tool an Indiana, I ain't ever been to Gary
My women vary, I scoop 'em like Ben & Jerry
You with a special team, we kick it like Vinatieri
You listenin' to the boy, in the class that used to read slow
Now I got shows booked cause I'm good with the dictionary
My diction is an addiction
The way I give a description, some may consider it snitchin'
Just tryna give a vivid depiction how niggas was livin'
Would you rather hear me rap about stickin' dick in a vixen?
I used to cut grass, no car, just a bus pass
Now I puff enough gas to fill up a truck, dad
Treat your money like it's under your nose, you must stash
Enough cash for a rainy day
The forecast says that it's partially cloudy
My partner said he wanted 4 circles, I called it the Audi
Oh a cutie pie, this the soundtrack to Cooley High
I grew up 'round some niggas who were quick to let that Uzi fly
With more guns than that movie guy
And my prayers go to the families of Theater 9
I got films in my head, I got a theater mind
Prince and a poet, imagine if Caesar could rhyme, nigga
My daddy asked me, what I keep a pistol for
I said, "without it, I feel naked as a stripper pole"
That's how it is when you were raised by some triple OGs
The first thing they taught a nigga was keep a trigger close
Do this shit for Stone Mountain, Stevenson and Miller Grove
I'm a Swisher kisser, I'm twistin' up that mistletoe
Call it Dragonball Z, cause it's green as Piccolo
Somebody let these niggas know to give me the credit I deserve

[Hook]

[Outro]
Give me the credit I deserve, give me the credit I deserve
Give me the credit I deserve, give me the credit I deserve
Give me the credit I deserve, give me the credit I deserve
Give me the credit I deserve, don't wanna give me the credit I deserve
Fuck y'all niggas
