[Verse]
This is black history, so I dropped this shit in February
I had to do it, man I swear this shits so necessary
I'm like an old piece of French cheese
Nigga' I'm so legendary
I used to play the corner like the secondary
But somewhere deep beneath my mind, there was a treasure buried
Instead of rapping about them pistols that you never carried
Tell them how them folks'll hide your ass to Nevuary
Our Daddy's in the chain gain so it's hereditary
Your momma still single and she never married
First you started selling Mary, now you sellin' Carrie
Underwood from your hood, now you just somebody celly
This is death of the trap
If you sleeping on me don't enjoy the rest of your nap
I'm tired of hearing fake niggas and they regular raps
They right, I guess there ain't no real leaders left on the map
Amen
