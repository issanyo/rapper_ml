[Hook: Kelechi]
Lookin' at your frame and it's sittin' right
Baby girl you got that get right
You gon' get it all by midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight
Little black dress so skin tight
And I ain't coming in without an invite
But you can get it all by midnight
Put your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight

[Verse 1: Kelechi]
I spent my last twenty bucks on that drink in your hand
So are you gonna keep tryna chat or do you wanna...dance?
I'm the type to go grab you the sun if you ask for a tan
Aw yeah, aw yeah-ah
Your digits if you do not jot 'em down
I'll think about you when you're not around
When I think of how I used to thot around
Karma gon' get me a daughter now
Women like you the whole reason I bought a round
Trip ticket to visit this part of town
So tell the bartender to order rounds
And we'll leave before the ticket come around
Cause I'm...

Lookin' at your frame and it's sittin' right
Baby girl you got that get right

And I ain't coming in without an invite
But you can get it all by midnight
Put your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight

[Verse 2: Cyhi The Prince]
She got her hands in the air like it's midnight
Got a couple bottles of that get right
Lil nigga but I like the fit tight
Hope she don't dislike niggas this height
But my wrist ice and my whip nice
If that pussy slit tight, I'mma hit twice
When I whip it out like a Swiss knife
She biting on my neck like a pit fight
(But what if she don't let you hit Cy?)
Take a hitchhike ,wish your bitch might
Shit every nigga got some dog in 'em
Girl I been thinking of you all winter
Ass is a [?] let me fall in ya
Slid a hundred dollars to the bartender
I wanna take you somewhere and it's all dinner
Putting so much wood in her, caught a splinter
Jumping off them jets, hopping off sprinters
Shawty come and kick it with a boss nigga
Where every night feel like New Years
Drink a Budweiser like a root beer
Mike Tyson when we're fuckin', girl I chew ears
Hah, hope you don't think I'm too weird
Girl I make it hard for you to stand up
When I hit it from the back with my hands up

[Hook: Kelechi]
Lookin' at your frame and it's sittin' right
Baby girl you got that get right
You gon' get it all by midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight
Little black dress so skin tight
And I ain't coming in without an invite
But you can get it all by midnight
Put your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight
Hands in the air like midnight
Got your hands in the air like midnight

[Verse 3: Phay]
Yeah, I'm not really one that you can try, try
Really got a song with Cyhi, fuck a white lie
Can you hit the bong like a hippie wearing tie-dye
Can we get along Rodney King and sippin' Mai Tais
I don't want no beef, I don't wanna kill the peace
So I gotta keep a piece on my side, side
I don't wanna leave but I gotta leave
Get up off my Jeep, call an uber for a ride, ride
You're tryna be a freak, I don't wanna beat
I just wanna see if I can lick your inner thigh, thigh
If your man talkin' reckless I'mma hit him with the TEC
Cause I'm feeling a connection like wi-fi
Hot damn and that pussy kinda dry, dry
Got me feeling like I'm living in the Chi-na
But my flow wetter than a whole drive-by
Shoulda known better, Phay gone bye-bye, bitch

Hands in the air like midnight
