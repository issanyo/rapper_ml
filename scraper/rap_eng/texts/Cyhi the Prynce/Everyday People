[Intro: CyHi The Prynce]
Beautiful people, I want to thank y'all for coming out tonight. Yes, yes, yes, clap your hands with me one time. Hey! Hey! CyHi!

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
Smooth rider, coupe driver
Before that, me and my nigga would do MARTA
Steal cars for Slim Jims and screwdrivers
Learned more from the streets then the schools taught us
True scholars, new chopper
Oh you're layin' on the ground, Mufasa
It's an eerie feelin' when they try to 2Pac yah
Laying in the bed and don't know who shot yah
For a few dollars, Robin Jeans with some new Pradas
Put these diamonds on my neck cause my daddy was blue collar
Lower class school, I sorta passed
We all failed history but swear we know our math
When I was in England I felt like a grimy little boy
Cause I never thought I would go to Bath
And that's a line that some y'all are never gonna grasp
But I can't wait to go back with my better half, cause

[Pre-Hook: Alanna]
We all was left to die
So you can't be scared to fly
You don't how far you go
If you never try
So can I testify?
What we stressin' 'bout?
The white man said we all was equal
But that was just a lie

[Hook: Alanna]
Cause I am everyday people
I am everyday people
And everyday people

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
This for the workin' class
So gon' with your twerkin' ass
The type to sell your soul for a Birkin Bag
Cause if it wasn't for the club you was workin' at
You wouldn't be no different from the lady at the burger shack
Our neighborhoods is where the young boys get murdered at
Boost Mobile chirpin' back, locked up for servin' crack
Lookin' for a purse to snatch, our first attack was right up the street
From where the church was at, I know y'all didn't interpret that
So I had to stop by to give the church some cash
And if I see a pretty lady walkin' I'm reversin' back
And all my partners need a purple patch
Buryin' a friend, it don't get no worse then that
Black babies get arrested before they even develop
Put us in a cage, I swear that shit is a set up
But I'm just out here tryna keep it together
Pay a few bills, go get somethin' to eat with the fellas cause

[Hook: Alanna]
