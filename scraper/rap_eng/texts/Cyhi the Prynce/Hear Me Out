(chorus)
A lot of shit been on my mind
Somebody gotta hear me out
All I see is signs that I need to take a different route
I dont want to but If I leave now
What I'm gon do?
So I pour some wine
This is something I'mma figure out

(verse 1)
Sitting up in my room me and my automatic
I live in the fast lane but really I'm caught in traffic
Mama I'm going crazy I hope that these walls is padded
My girl just had an abortion I wish that she oughta had it
But I'm addicted to women so should I call it a habit?
That marijuana smoke call it my fabric
You smell gas whenever my car passes
My music all the way turned up like Roscoe Dash's
I'm from the Clay that's where my Cash is
I shoulda made A's in all my classes
But I had that good from the Bay they bought it the fastest
Got junkies through the roof that's why we call em addicts
But I was Martin Luther King since a teen child
Because I think quiet but I dream loud
Speaking of loud that's what you smell in my green clouds
But Kush ain't even cool no more they on that lean now
(Chorus)

(verse 2)
I'm back to selling dubs the size of teabags
My partna asked me "how much you gonna charge for three bags?"
He said "I know your number low" I told him "ain't no free sacks, I need $60"
He said "Damn shawty I'll be back"
Then I replied that I been going through the same thing that he has
"True I got more fans than the average man but none of the loot done led me
To the end of the week gotta live by the beat
Like you live check to check you dont move yo feet then I dont eat
So we like neck & neck" he said "we thought you was rich ever since you left the dec"
I "I am nigga that's the catch!" relationships is worth more than you making chips
But it's hard when these record labels try and rape your gift
And the only time I'm selling out is if I'm making zip's
But I keep bags like I'm finna take a trip
So I will never bend like a paperclip
Then he said "keep it real & say whatever's under your handkerchief"

(chorus)

(verse 3)
I seen it all through my Ray Bans
You niggas couldn't walk through the mall in my Space Jams
Niggas praying on my downfall but when you done
Make sure you say Amen, ran through like 8 grand in a days span
I blue cheese cuz I hate ranch
Drew Brees never claimed to be a Saint man but I'm in great hands Allstate Stan
Mama stay praying, Llama in the waistband my head spinning but I promise I dont break dance
Hating niggas leaving comments on my page but I'm paralyzed cuz
Them the type of people I can't stand
Friends'll burn & cross you like the K clan
But I forgive em so when I see em we shake hands
I just wish I had 10 percent of Ye fans
And when I die they'll say "he was a great man"

(chorus)
