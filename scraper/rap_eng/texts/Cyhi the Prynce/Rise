[Intro: Cyhi The Prynce]
CyHi, okay
Yeah, hah

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
My music make the crowd move, hah
I'm in the car rolling cow food, yeah
But I still keep a strap wit me
I ain't never been a slipper, that's a house shoe, hah
Got my education without school
Quiet as a mouse move but I keep a loud tool
Play games you'll be shitting in a pouch fool
Got stock like DOW do
New hardtop, off the car lot
Hit the gas, tires smoke like cigar shops
Make ya jaw drop, bought it off the narc cops
Tax on the work we got them H&R blocks
Alumni, yeah I'm from the school of hard knocks
Looking out for the 12 Roger Staubach
No cafe but we had them hard rocks
For the bread they'll throw you off of dark docks
So before ya heart stop, or the narcs knock
I gotta give it to you straight like a bar shot
Cuz the streets don't play fair, huh
Niggas mad cause you got more rides than the state fair
Terrified I can't lie, boy I stay scared
So I keep a lotta toys like a day care, huh
Hold the shotty like a bass player
I ain't a killer I'm just trying to stay safe player

[Hook: Curren$y]
It was my only wish to rise
It was my only wish to rise
On them jealous muthafuckas I despise
Coming down clean, bumping Ridin' Dirty, getting high
It was my only wish to rise
On them jealous muthafuckas I despise
Coming down clean, bumping Ridin' Dirty, getting high

[Verse 2: Pill]
It's a mystery, break out ya magnifying glasses
Wit ya hat and fine jackets, Macs & iron ratchets
Asinine bastards big as packs of line backers
Pussy fat wit fine asses in the back wit lines asking
Who that on that new track wit that rap reclined backwards
I knew that it was you but matter fact don't mind asking
Cooling on em, moving on em, my shooters on em
Show this flow off like a trophy and a new diploma
Graduation, crackers say that I wasn't gon’ make it
Pack of paper, pen and pad and now calculate it
Malcolm made it, cinematic and black related
Addicts and crack and bases, my status is cracking faces
Embarrassing cracking vases at the dinner party
I took no slow classes baby but yes I been retarded
You see my folks acting crazy like it's in kindergarten
I'm bringing heat like old ladies when they is menopausing
Okay then

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Yeah, been at the lowest of my lows
That's why I get high hoping no one ever know
To open up my mind I can show you what I wrote
Or rather show you how to boat
And hope that you can live or float
Independently self made and well paid
Three whips, one chain, no welt pain
When you treeing over niggas they gon’ yell shade
They outta patience where I live cuz they sell weight
Avoided the temptation of crack slinging
But Lincoln Park had it looking like back in the 80s
Now my partners getting broads and the hottest whips
And I was sweating hours trying to get the illest scholarship
Ain't have a pot to piss, I wasn't born rich
When I be writing I'm as hungry as a model bitch
She got the fattest ass they got the hottest look
Leaving wit 8 bitches I need some octopuss
See how Wale go J4 DS
My lake shore whore never be on the BS
Bullshit, Chi-Town, riding around, top down
Hanging with the squares will be the reason niggas not around
What it do, Penny foams all blue
Or you could prolly use a nigga drive welcome to my car pool
Double MG shit, G double O D shit
Five time foul niggas need to stop reaching

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Curren$y]
High as fuck with my down ass
Bitch roll to the Porsche from the bus pass
But got lost when me and the cash crossed paths
Indo smoke out my nose no mustache
Bitches I want but that money is a must have
Fuck is you drunk? Pay that up front like the Ferrari trunk
Be careful you won't have to be sorry hun
Stay close to the G's and you might learn sum'n
Might earn sum'n
Chop it up like mobsters on the rooftop let you burn sum'n
Stop talking so much
Soak it up next time you have sum'n to say, boss the fuck up
Butcher knives done died trying to be as sharp as us
Talking ‘bout you on yo way
See them niggas downstairs 'fore you talk to us
By appointments no walk ups

[Hook]
