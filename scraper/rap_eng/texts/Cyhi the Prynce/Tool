[Intro: CyHi]
Hello, this is an Ivy League announcement
We do not condone violence, but we do encourage self-defense
CyHi, like I don't mean no harm by this
I don't wanna promote the wrong things, but
CyHi

[Verse 1: CyHi]
I'm paranoid, but I ain't scared, it all started off Bankhead
Got jumped by six niggas, thank God I ain't dead
Went to school with a black eye, I'm like, "fuck it I'm that guy"
Plus I'm that fly but can't act like some people didn't laugh when I pass by
So I went and bought me a deuce deuce, a little rusty but it do shoot
Never was the one to tote a gun, but everybody in my crew do
Cause we probably ran the train on a nigga's main girl like choo-choo
Why you mad at me, dog, cause your girl nasty like couscous?
I stay strapped like the task force, and I bought it for the jack boys
Cause I run with niggas who make bank off the glass
And I ain't talking about a backboard
Just went and got me a five seven, nigga I'm bout to spend bout a rack for it
So if a nigga try to harm me, no need to ask

[Hook]
I pull my tool on a hater (tool on a hater)
I pull my tool on a hater (tool on a hater)
I pull my tool on a hater (tool on a hater)
I pull this tool on a hater (tool on a hater)
Tote ya toast from to L.A. to Chicago, New Orleans
And if a hater runs up on your car door, let it ring

[Verse 2: Trouble]
You see the motherfuckin' tool here?
Make a nigga forget about it, no rules here
Initiated for hatin' the conversation I was having with a woman
Round the Temptation and he were David Ruffin, slick hunt
The DT on my face, and then he thought about the bussin
Not the video but how I really get down in the public
No mercy, it's nothin', no bluffin'
You got a decision, I suggest you lose life over something
Click clack, blaow, another man down
Not promoting the violence, but its too many niggas wilding
In the city where it's shitty, and I pity you fools
That's the reason older people out here carrying tools
Younger brothers like walkin' around just thinking it's cool
With no education, they ain't even thinking of school
With no money in they pocket or they wallet, ima scratch that
Don't even got the fund to run and go and cop that
But everybody wanna sag pants, hang on the corner
Smokin' marijuana claiming they gangsta
I'll show ya gangsta when I pull out a banger
Just for you haters, saying "Trouble a singer"
I, I , I'll put you on a respirator, I put this tool on you haters

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pill]
See what happened was, is I was trapping cuz
Before I really gave a fuck what rapping was
The nicks and the dimes I would bag 'em up
On the block where I had to have a gat to bust
Hey what's that sound in the back of us
The blackest truck is backin' up, I'm mad as fuck
It might just be these hoes
In a minute i won't need these clothes (naw)
Need to talk to J's who need these stones
Listen Brit Brit you and Keke gone (okay then)
It's a motherfuckin yay trap
And if you on the slick shit bitch you stay strapped
ASAP take that, like Puff, some niggas pulled up like bruh what's up
And opened up both doors
And I don't really know 'em so you know where I'm going I got my hand on the motherfuckin' .44
They like "what's up?" I'm like "not shit"
This chrome thing full of hot shit
He reached for his and I let it fly
And it's a guarantee somebody got hit (okay then)
And the moral of the story not to fuck with the kid
While I'm servin' like a waiter
Cause I never hesitate to
Up shirt, put this tool on a motherfuckin hater

[Hook]
