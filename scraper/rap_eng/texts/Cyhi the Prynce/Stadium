[Hook]
Take me to the stadium, I'm gonna play my heart out there
I'm gonna play it everywhere
Ooh I may be down but I will rise
I'll take my feet and kiss the sky
Cause I'm gonna live forever

[Verse 1: Cyhi The prynce]
First I check my bags, and then my jet leaves
And by the time I land I better have my bread please
And a sack of purple, we smoke that Ed Reed
And lame rappers on stage, that's my pet peeve
Yeezy said we # 1, hard to be humble when you stuntin on the jumbo tron
Fucking groupies with Louie Vuitton condoms on
So I be at the ESPYs with Becky and a cumabunn
You don't like Prynce, you a Mark like McGwire
I take it like, smoking bud got me wiser
Jumped in the truck lit the blunt up with the lighter
Then I told the driver

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Just hoped out the plane, hands free, I don't pack a thing
I just hit the mall leave with more bags than the baggage claim
Yeah when I'm in your city they will never act the same
Girls always say I'm bout my cheese like a Packers game
World wide like UPS but I ain't in the package game
Bob put it in the spot, they don't even ask my name
Winning! But do not call me Charlie Sheen
In the back taking shots, you can call it archery
B.o.B and CyHi, we so high like astral plane
All you see is strange clouds, when we come around ain't that a shame
Next night it's the same thing
Touch down roll the purp
Tap the window, chauffeur

[Hook]

[Verse 3: CyHi]
Cause I'm so off the chain, never lose a game
Always had the drive like I never caught the train
Mister hall of fame bitches call my name
Prynce falling off you on that quincy carter cane
Franchise player, anti hater high school jock I was man like slater
Winning by a landslide, get paper with my hands tied
If I see your girl better bang, I'll slay her
'Cause all I gotta do is hit the stage and break a leg
And I don't think I'm lucky shawty I just think I'm blessed
They say, "Prynce, where you want your funeral when you dead?"
And I look up and said
[Hook]
