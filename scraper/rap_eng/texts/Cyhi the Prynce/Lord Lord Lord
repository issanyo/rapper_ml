[Hook: K Camp]
Lord Lord Lord, I cannot tell if they playing
This life too crazy, I swear it's insane
Look at my wrist, you can tell I ain't got time
Look at my bitch, you can tell I ain't lie
Lord Lord Lord, I cannot tell if they playing
This life too crazy, I swear it's insane
Look at my wrist, you can tell I ain't got time
Look at my bitch, you can tell I ain't lie
Lord Lord Lord, Lord Lord Lord
Look at my wrist, you can tell I ain't got time
Look at my bitch, you can tell I ain't lie

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
Cause shawty the truth, look like somebody just shot at the coupe
I call it my Kennedy whip, I'm missing apart of my roof
My people been flashy since Africa, so pardon my roots
Choking on kush, got this rope on my neck I won't call it a noose
But I'm keeping the peace, I won't call it a truce
Glock or revolver, it don't matter cause all of 'em shoot
Been ballin' since I was a youth, I look like a starter from Duke
Lord I just wanna make a Meek Mill and menage with my blue flute
This bitch ain't from Kalamazoo
Boy it's all in the suit, roses are red, violets are blue
My money, my pistol, my diamonds are too
So bring all of the goose, ros√© and all of the brew
I be reneging the space cause I got a hard time following suit

[Hook: K Camp]
Lord Lord Lord, I cannot tell if they playing
This life too crazy, I swear it's insane
Look at my wrist, you can tell I ain't got time
Look at my bitch, you can tell I ain't lie
Lord Lord Lord, I cannot tell if they playing
This life too crazy, I swear it's insane
Look at my wrist, you can tell I ain't got time
Look at my bitch, you can tell I ain't lie
Lord Lord Lord, Lord Lord Lord
Look at my wrist, you can tell I ain't got time
Look at my bitch, you can tell I ain't lie

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
Lord Lord Lord, if they wanna go to war war war
I got two .22's, one about four .44's
My daddy told me, you can die by the sword sword sword
But I ain't got no choi-choi-choice
Cause some shits you can't affor-for-ford
So I'm ridin' round [?]
Why I'm serving niggas by choi-choi-choice
So before I got six feet, I wanna turn Peachtree into Freaknik
Toot my own horn, nigga, beep beep
Got a French hoe whole love to oui oui
And the pussy clean, she a neat freak
Fuck her so good she got a TT
I got a lead road runner, shawty meep meep
Kush came in the jar like it's pig feet
Back when I used to rock Enyce
I was tryna get her out of Baby Phat
Her boyfriend call her from Chile
Talking 'bout "Can I get my baby back?"

Lord Lord Lord, I cannot tell if they playing
This life too crazy, I swear it's insane
Look at my wrist, you can tell I ain't got time
Look at my bitch, you can tell I ain't lie
Lord Lord Lord, Lord Lord Lord
Look at my wrist, you can tell I ain't got time
Look at my bitch, you can tell I ain't lie
