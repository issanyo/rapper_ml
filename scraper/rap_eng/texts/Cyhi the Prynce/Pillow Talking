[Intro]
Quit pillow talking
Y'all need to quit pillow talking
Yea nigga, these hoes tell these secrets, boy
Like, tell a bitch something, man she get with another nigga, man
And just straight disrespect you
Be like, this is crazy

[Verse 1]
I made another song for the suckers
Married to a ho and wonder why he never trust her
Calling my phone ask me have I ever fucked her
That's like asking me has Chili ever fucked with Usher
These bitches play more games than the Rucker
Fuck around and scream another nigga name in the covers
I'm just glad I came in the rubber
Cause that talk about your life get just a lame and a busta
Now back to the story, her man name was Corey
I seen her in the club, I caught her like I'm Jordy
She say she 26, she had a little shorty
She from Chicago but went to school in Missouri
I got her number, I pulled her like a groin
Took her to the room, and flipped her like a coin
She told me all about how y'all relationship is boring
And all that lovey dovey shit is starting to get boring
So I advise you fellas

[Hook x2]
Quit pillow talking
You niggas still pillow talking
Quit pillow talking
These niggas still pillow talking

[Verse 2]
I'm just a single man tryna live a civil life
These niggas more like the pillow type
If you and your girl got into an argument
Y'all would probably have a pillow fight
The only chick I respect is a nigga wife
A girlfriend is just a bitch you don't want another nigga to pipe
I might just hit her tonight, send her a text, get her a flight
I'm in the bathroom while you on the laptop with her on Skype
I only put dick in her twice, then I passed that
I don't just wife a bitch cause her ass fat
I had a homeboy who used to drive a Jag
Back in '08 he met a girl, they fell in love fast, jack
I tried to tell him I knew some niggas who already smashed that
Then one day somebody broke into his crib
And the day befo' we just made a hundred racks flat
Now he mad at her but he the one who showed her where the stash at
I told you to

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
She was my pride and joy
Everything I want and more
But if you ask me how I feel inside
I wanna punch her ass in the head
I wanna punch her dead in the head
Fuck that bitch
Kicking you is all that I been thinking of
Kicking you is, oooh, oooh
Kicking you is all that I been thinking of
Kicking you is, oooh, oooh
