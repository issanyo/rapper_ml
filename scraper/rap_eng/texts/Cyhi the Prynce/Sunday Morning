Your girl is easy
Your bitch is easy like Sunday morning

[Verse 1 - Cyhi Da Prince]
She was ridin in the Acura
I pulled up from the back of her
Rolled the window down and said
“Hello, I am a bachelor
With excellent vernacular, ATL’s Ambassador”
She said “What you smoking on?!”
“Oh - that’s the smell of lavender”
“And you drive a nice car
You must be a trafficker!”
I said: “Girl, you a trip
You must be a traveller”
She said she was from Marietta
Went to school in Lassiter, but I don’t care
I just want to beat it up like Haggler
She said her name was Bridgette, and she like to kick it
But she got a boyfriend
I told her: "I could dig it"
She said: “If he catch us fuckin’ around
That nigga would be livid, admit it
You would be too if you was with this”
So I cut the bullshit and asked her for her digits
A couple days later, she came by to pay a visit
Now I’m in the room swinging wood
Like I’m playing cricket
So if you think she the one, my nigga
You should quit it

Your girl is easy
Your bitch is easy like Sunday morning

[Verse 2 - Cyhi Da Prince]
Yeah OK, here’s another scenario
I knew this girl from middle school
When it came to getting some
It was never difficult
She liked all the athletes
Came to all the track meets
And I was varsity so you know I had to hit her too
Her attitude was pitiful, reminds you of the typical
Bitch from up the street
Plus a liar: that’s habitual
Getting drunk and having sex
I swear the chick was pitiful
Sucking dick, trying to get rich, that’s a ritual
All the way through high school
Until she was a senior
Been about 7 years since a nigga seen her
Heard she moved away
But the rumors still linger
I used to have a partner named Mark
Who drove a Beemer
Said he met a girl that used to go to Redan
And he's in love with her
I said: “You jumping off the deep end”
He said: "Her name was Kim
Half-black and Puerto Rican"
"You talking about the Kim that graduated in ’03 man?!"
