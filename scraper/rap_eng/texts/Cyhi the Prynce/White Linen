[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
Yeah, the head count on my bed count
Probably more than my thread count
Most of 'em I dread now
But at least you know I'm gon' lay it down
I won' apologize for all the women I went with
That got messed around
Shawty, why you all dressed up?
I like you more when you dressed down
'Cause the ass on you is ridiculous
Now I'm meticulous who I kick it with
Miss lady, I know my vows even though I'm not that articulate
Indigitous of my old man
Can't find the girl who wanna hold hands
Walk down the aisle, raise my child
Smart enough to get a gold band
Slow dance to some Jagged Edge
Then we pulled off with them old cans
Honeymoon in the cold sand
Fuck the club, we're tryna own land
Floor plans out the ocean
We can go tan where the boat land
Build schools, that's the whole plan
But until then, where the hoes, man?

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
White linen
I make most of mistakes when I'm laying on top of white linen
When the fives line up just right at night, are you listening?
I am sinning, white women like swimming right in my
White linen

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
We throw a party and I might've took a bit of the shrooms
I played my guitar, people thought I was cool
And suddenly, the whole scene played in slow motion
Who's in my bed now? 'Cause I haven't a clue

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
White linen
I make most of mistakes when I'm laying on top of white linen
When the fives line up just right at night, I listen
I am sinning, white women like swimming right in my
White linen

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
What am I trying to prove?
What am I trying to prove?

[Verse 3: blackbear]
Just had a threesome at this party we decided to throw
I grab one by the hair, I grab the other bitch by the throat
And suddenly, the whole scene played in slow motion
I gave 'em each blackbear hoodies and a bump of my blow

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
White linen
I make most of mistakes when I'm laying on top of white linen
When the fives line up just right at night, I listen
I am sinning, white women like swimming right in my
White linen, white linen

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
What am I trying to prove?
