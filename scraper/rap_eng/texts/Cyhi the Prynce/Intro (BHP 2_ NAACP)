I heard some niggas thinking ‘bout attacking me
I keep some cats with me that turn to killers for your majesty
Semi-automatic, let a nigga have it
Like he asked to borrow it, and he ain’t never give it back to me
The audacity, I pull out like a cavity
Since a snaggle-teeth little boy full of agony
Like the slave owner’s gun, I’m a masterpiece
I treat my shawty like a boom-box that’s full of batteries
It’s blasphemy to stand here and rap about my salary
This is for the working class people at them factories
Stone Mountain nigga, Ivy State is my academy
And I used to go to church up the street from [Macathy?]
But I swear the street life will captivate a nigga
How you weighin’ work on your calculator, nigga?
I swear I’ve had so many yellow bitches
If you put ‘em in a room look like the Packers played the Steelers
Ya’ll hate a nigga more than what these crackers hate a nigga
Ya’ll just waiting for the perfect time to assassinate a nigga
Meet me in the jungle, better have an alligator with you
If it’s cow then this 40 cal will calibrate a nigga, huuh?
Speeding through the night like it’s Talladega, nigga
A thousand pounds of mid came in on the tractor trailer with her
Duffel bag full of money ‘cause you gotta pay the dealer
I done seen it all and I ain’t have to touch a milli-
Gram of the yams, going H.A.M. on a canvas
Say that I’m the realeast, I just say I am what I am
Flow like water, give a damn ‘bout a dam
If I see the cops, nigga like Cam I’m ‘a scram
‘Cause you want to get peanut butter and jam when you jam
Section eight and some food stamps for your fam
You can’t study for this test, you can’t cheat on life’s exam
When you good wit’ your sheep, man no need to buy a Lamb, nigga
