[Verse 1]
I'm at the London edition with an abundance of bitches
The only way I save them, if they becoming a Christian
Growing up I made the dumbest decisions
But this is what you get when your son was on Ritalin
And other prescriptions while stuck in detention
My niggas got tats on they face like they come from New Zealand
Who thinks killing's a wonderful feeling
So like a treadmill, nigga, don't make us run in the building
Tim tell [?] I'm the best to ever do it
Kendrick Perkins with the strap, I hardly ever shoot it
Got a pair of barracudas and I ain't scared to use 'em
Every time I let 'em off it's kinda therapeutic
I was very real, recruited to be a student of hip hop
First I dropped out then I start moving ziplocks
Grew up in Forest Park up the street from the big lots
Who you are today you are tomorrow, bitch, that's a wrist watch
Everything I write is murder, I'm Hitchcock
Your favorite rapper I'm on his heal like a flip flop
At the end of weak people, of course I was pissed off
Cause people dying' overseas who don't Crip walk
I'm a leader like four cups
Tell [?] to hit they guts
I swear to God, this ain't no shit I'm making up
Everything I said it vain is how I take my blood
Me and Skepta in the studio burnin' down the bush
I'm in London with a thousand pounds of kush
No really, a thousand pounds of kush
But in Atlanta that's 28 grams
Don't make me pull your card, you fraud like credit scams
Niggas wanna kill me, they jealous I never am
So David tell Jesus I'm 'bout to go BethleHAM
Cause my guns is like sophomore albums, they never jam
I told Ye I'm bout to go to Tim Westwood
The only thing he said is make sure you dress good
If my current bitch ain't watching this then my ex could
Even though we started on the left foot
I'm a genius, but I never read a textbook
Cause my trappin' was jumpin' out the gym, nigga, Westbrook
From Stone Mountain to Tech Wood
Huh, lookin' for my next next jux
Can't remember the last time I slept good
Okay, I might not got the best hooks
But I wouldn't wish these bars on nobody
My nigga, God bless Shook

[Verse 2]
Some people say they never heard of me, I guess that's alright
I don't expect a nigga to know me, niggas barely know Christ
Listening to my radio, writing raps in my computer
Don't that sound like a stereotype?
I been big since a kid, I live a Terio life
Still brisk on my fleece for them material flights
Can't be crying' 'bout a bitch who was never your wife
These hoes won't even bring flowers to your burial site
Canary on ice, my hood full of Israelites
Dyin’ over Jordan like Joshua Jericho fight
I'm 5'7", but people still look up to me
Plenty fights with Drako, I swear that shit done toughened me
He kept a cold pistol on him and drew, luckily
He ain’t kill a nigga, all I got was a bloody tee
This the shit that'll make you call your partner like
"Last night Cyhi said some shit that really stuck with me"
I was out there movin' with them gangstas, but that wasn't me
Real recognize real, rock a DJ Mustard beat
I got a first pound from my Dogg, I think Daz what Kurupt-ed me
Last night me and God talked
He said "you can’t complain, look how much your watch cost"
Naw, I'm not gettin' paws off
But I’m the best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk, nigga
