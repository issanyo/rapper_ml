Goddamn right…
Alright…
Ok…
Flex, ain’t no need to uh…
Hold on..
Gotta get in the spirit
Y’all ready?

(VERSE)
Yo, hold on Flex
Ain’t no need to juice ‘em
Everybody know it’s Bishop, yeain't gotta introduce him
Flow harder still I’m just waitin on you to cue ‘em
To drop a bomb like a hoodlum in Jerusalem
‘fo I lose ‘em
Shit it started getting gruesome once I grew some
It really was a art the way we drew guns
Got a tool from this dude around the corner
Told the bully don’t make me dump this tray like my school lunch
Cause I heard when you see me you gon do sumthin’
Lame ass nigga prolly never had a twosome
Fuck prison, did jail for like a cool month
The first suits we bought was for court, we ain't do prom
Atlanta where I flew from
Started with a few songs
Two thumbs up everytime I spit a new Psalms
Now my resolution is revolution
Cause bullets go further than Jim Gung can shoot a nuke from
Flow like Poseidon they so excited when Zeus come
Rappers bite it like Trident I never chew gum
Pen my own shit, I don’t need no help to write it
Just know I deliver like Hepatitis C
Flow is so righteous when God calls me home
I bet satan gon be hatin it, hell will have a riot
The way I tell a vision you gon have to televise it
I was part of several heistses wiping white, Vanilla Ice it
At the Hyatt counting money hella quiet
Hustler losing weight, I don’t know a better diet
Burning gas in the hybrid, send a bag overnight it
I was toting pistols way before I had a license
Overthrow the slave ship, nigga I’m a pirate
Even David had Goliath
Slay the giant, my people stay defiant
Cause this is our land and, we was never Irish
I’m so loyal I could never have a side bitch
Talking outta turn, I can tell you a dry snitch
So pay homage to your highness
Cause if we speaking in general, nigga you just a Private
A cadet, risk your life for Pateks
Do anything for your boys but show your wife no respect
The last nigga who ran off twice on my connect
They ain't even kill him, they just sliced off his legs
Ugh! Flow grosser than our net
If this was ’95 you woulda bought it on cassette
So be careful who you call your connect huh
Cause these niggas cutthroat it ain't gotta be Gillette
So shorty call your roll and quiet on the set
Cause my crew’ll come thru and shoot a pilot on your steps
Hold on…
Had to take a moment of silence for myself now…
Back to the double entendres
Got so many punches knock a brutha unconscious
Couple blond Sandras in pajamas going bonkers
If she fuck me good I pour some provolone on ya
Get me hard as silver Imma have to long john ya
Got it locked from Dullesville all the way to Conyers
And I put that on my cousin aunt Tonya
Yeah, hold on, ha
I been brainwashed
I wrote my raps in cocaine spots
My time in the streets was so real I can’t even name drop
Birds of a feather, I’m still with the same flock
That’s prolly why I ain’t popped
How can you blame cops
Got fifty rounds in the same Glocks
That they got and these modified rifles ain't stock
Cause all my niggas bear arms like a tank top
The barrel on the 12-gauge look like a tank top
Thank God I made it out it feel like dodging rain drops
These hoes is too expensive, I’m still fucking the same thots
I stay away from these Hollywood bitches
Cause if Chyna rob me I’m killing everybody in Shanghai
Got it for the low man, everything thai
My OG’s got more rank that Frank got
The coke was from Columbia and the heroin came from Bangkok
When it’s hot, it look like a glass of plain scotch
Dang Cy, what you got to complain ‘bout
Shit I’d rather slang pot for what I ain’t got
These niggas rather sit at home and watch paint dry
And the peace of mind is the only thing I can’t buy
Ha! Wise words from my intuition
I grind for it, I never been into ish here
Schooling rappers, y’all should be paying me in tuition
Don’t forget who put you in position
They said I couldn’t bring a gun to New York
So I got a used one from this Queens cat, he said it’s in mint condition huh
But I doubt if it’s any friction
Cause if it this I gotta draw like a split decision
Nigga listen
This the closest shit to "It Was Written"
That shit you spitting is fiction, I’m just reminiscing huh
How can your favorite rapper be a liar
Have they ever thought about when they see Messiah
And They ask ‘em bout all them lies they be tellin in they raps
I wonder will he send them to the sea of fire
Cause the truth is what we admire
This that shit that turn Jesus to a freedom fighter
Huh Lord Niermeyer in my street attire
Huh I’m fucking with y’all
Let’s get it…
