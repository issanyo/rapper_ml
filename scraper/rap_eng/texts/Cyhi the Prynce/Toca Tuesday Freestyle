[Verse]
Prince love rappin' but he in it for dough
Try to take it, he got a 3 minute-to-four
He invented the flow, its just intended to blow
Cause my infinite spinach got my eyes squinted for show
I been a menace, make dennis look like a innocent ho
Playin' tennis with dro, servin 'til I finish and go
The lieutenant with more ranks than ten colons, been rollin'
Ever since the prince been pen holdin'
I been strictly, about my money
But I was just on the DL like ken griffey
Hold up, I even got germany sewed up
Since the prince came, MC's currency slowed up
To stop me dawg it take yall to forfeit
And i'll go back to slingin' 8 ball like 4 dicks
I represent this southerin clique
Other than this, I'm in your ass like I'm smugglin' shit
And I'm sick with the paper-mate
I got bitches that'll fake a rape
To get you banged up for bringing' my paper late
I'm a pimp not a cake a date
I'm the type to get your chick horny as fuck and make her wait
The women think you on something when you give it up
That's why more niggas broke cause a broad got they divends stuck
This is my life and I'mma live it up
I got the east on my side and I'm bout to lock the pacific up
My antagonist is the faggot is savages
Come through and flash the mag at his head with hazardous lead
Your troops induce me, to let loose the duece
Hit' em politely and say "oops excuse me"
I ain't gone argue with you and start talkin' foul
But believe the only beef we let walk is cow
So get your mind right, cause mines white, lines like
I got two nines, you ain't got to look at the time twice
It's me, I got the whole rap game soliticin'
Slack slang ridiculous, ask game, I mention it
Many nigga call my phone for nick's
He thought my exact name was Nicholas
It's Max Payne you wack lames
I snatch dames
My chat game is infamous
Clap aim, leave'em with back pains, I'm strapped mane
Police want to hate on me
It's not a job when we say we lookin' for the J-O-B's
Cause they hoppin' out of the van, quick we spot'em and ran
They don't want us sellin white now they got a problem with tan
Damn, we got to get it how we live
We don't care we got to come and get it out your crib
We could fight but we bring the toys out next
Leave a hater with more patches than a boy-scout vest
Killin' me? I dare you to try to
Cause I leave you throwin' up blood like piru
Nigga what
