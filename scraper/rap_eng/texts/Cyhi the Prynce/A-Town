[Intro: CyHi The Prynce]
Yeah

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce & Travis Porter]
Okay, I represent for my city
Hold it down for my town
I'm riding down I-20
Hell yeah, eastbound
Those real niggas in Bankhead
All the way to Stone Mountain
I'm throwin' up the A-Town
Throwin' up the A-Town
Okay, I'm sliding down on Lenox
Keep a vic in my crown
I hit the mall and I spend it
All this money I count
I remember the pool palace
I remember the bounce
(Yeah) Throwin' up the A-Town
(CyHi) Throwin' up the A-Town

[Verse 1: CyHi the Prynce]
A-T-L, home of the brave
So I had to make a song for the A
Shawty this is where I'm born and I'm raised
I represent this shit 'til I'm gone in the grave
Bustin like Chipper Jones with the gauge
I'm sicker than the CDC
Money longer than peachtree street
Been here before Luda had DTP
Huh, Southside to the Northside
I'm at the Hawks game sittin court side
Come to my city, ain't no tour guide
I can tell you where and where not to joy ride
Huh, this the new Atlanta
I'm a country nigga so excuse my manners
Every night of the week it's a club poppin
All you see is stars like the movie channel
Take you to the Bluff and then we shoot to Candler
All these other rapper tryin to use the grammar
I know they pissed of
Cuz we shittin on these niggas we can use a pamper
Money green like a new banana
From the A-Town so I had to do the anthem for
Zone 1 & Zone 6
And shout out to the Braves for letting me use the sample
Cause I...

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce & Travis Porter]
Okay, I represent for my city
Hold it down for my town
I'm riding down I-20
Hell yeah, eastbound
Those real niggas in Bankhead
All the way to Stone Mountain
I'm throwin' up the A-Town
Throwin' up the A-Town
Okay, I'm sliding down on Lenox
Keep a vic in my crown
I hit the mall and I spend it
All this money I count
I remember the pool palace
I remember the bounce
Throwin' up the A-Town
Throwin' up the A-Town

[Verse 2: CyHi the Prynce]
A-T-L we back on the map
Where every lil nigga gotta strap in his lap
Anyway I just passed Capital Ave
Flying down 20 headed back to Dekalb
As I turn the wheel, by Turner Field
From round the corner from Summer Hill
I had sex with the girl at the Four Seasons
Had the bitch screaming out Thomasville
From Godby To Jimmy Carter
From Baker road to L-Town
This is where I made a lot of money
From all the bails that I mailed down
My teacher said I was jail bound
You tripping bitch you fell down
I dropped out of school could've went to open camp
But look at me I'm doing well now
All I ever wanted is to win a Grammy
Buy a box Chevy get it dipped in candy
You wasn't the shit back in high school
If you didn't have a girl who went to Chamblee
I'm CyHi a.k.a Mr. Bag a bitch like Kroger
I just represent Atlanta, I do this shit for Georgia
Cause I....

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce, Travis Porter & B.o.B]
Okay, I represent for my city
Hold it down for my town
I'm riding down I-20
Hell yeah, eastbound
Those real niggas in Bankhead
All the way to Stone Mountain
I'm throwin' up the A-Town
Throwin' up the A-Town
Okay, I'm sliding down on Lenox
Keep a vic in my crown
I hit the mall and I spend it
All this money I count
I remember the pool palace
I remember the bounce
(Hey) Throwin' up the A-Town
(Ayy) Throwin' up the A-Town

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Riding in the Cutlass smoking on a black
Man it don't get more Decatur than that
What's better than that ain't nothing better than that
Ain't nothing better than that
See through the bullshit like cellophane rap
All the slick talk we don't entertain that
Better take a step back, last nigga came 'round here talking shit
Left and never came back
Nigga I'm high, high like eagle pussy
Rolling up a heavyweight rap
My crib lay back, my chick lay back
My seat lay back yeah everything match
Niggas tryna act brave, man we the home of that
You lookin for whatever it's a zone for that
Getting paper ain't nothing wrong with that
Yeah we bout that coin like a laundromat
Maybe Candler Road make me feel like this
Or maybe OutKast make me feel like this
Put your A's up if you feel like this
We get the Georgia Dome jumping like we still got Vick
It's a dirty game and scared at that
Blame it on the red and black what better than that
Ain't nothing better than that, ain't nothing better than that

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce & Travis Porter]
Okay, I represent for my city
Hold it down for my town
I'm riding down I-20
Hell yeah, eastbound
Those real niggas in Bankhead
All the way to Stone Mountain
I'm throwin' up the A-Town
Throwin' up the A-Town
Okay, I'm sliding down on Lenox
Keep a vic in my crown
I hit the mall and I spend it
All this money I count
I remember the pool palace
I remember the bounce
Throwin' up the A-Town
Throwin' up the A-Town
