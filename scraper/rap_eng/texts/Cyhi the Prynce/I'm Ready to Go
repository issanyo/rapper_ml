[Verse 1: Cyhi]
A hater called my phone then I heard him mention gun play
I was like for what? he said  you was in my bitch's Hyundai"
When? "Last Monday," what's her name? "Shantae"
Man that shit beyond gay, let her do that Elton John date
So I'm with the shotgun any given Sunday
Rolling up some Bombay, while my nigga John play
A legend in this rap shit, people call me Andre
They compare me to that dude married to Beyonce
So I was with my goons on a lunch break
I told them 'bout my phone call, he said "where the punk stay?"
I don't give a fuck Prynce I'll ride down a one-way
To a dead end hop out then let the gun spray
AK-47 make they go to heaven
I'll leave him in the church while he lay below the reverend
I called my lil niggas and they riding too
So if you want that pussy then Prynce all you got to do is...

[Hook x2]
Give me the green light
I'm strapped with this 4-5
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
