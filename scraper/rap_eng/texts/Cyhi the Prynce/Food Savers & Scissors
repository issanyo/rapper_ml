[Intro: Cyhi The Prince]
Yeah, this is for all the Prynceton students
To be in this Ivy League shit
There are 2 things that you must have

[Hook: Cyhi The Prince]
Food savers and scissors,Yeah
Food savers and scissors,Yeah

[Verse 1: Cyhi The Prince]
OK
These are all my accesories
Especially if you invest in weed
All I ever sold was marijuana
I ain't selling nothing with a recipe
I'm in the bae, not Chesapeake
Seen more trees than you'll ever see
Put a pound of kush on a nigga head
If he ever think about flexing me
Food savers and scissors
2 flavours I give you
Got granddaddy, got OG
You can use papers or swishers
Just get a bag, fill it up
Cut the top, then you seal it up
All my partners got rich off it
They all worth a quarter mill' and up
I don't know any niggas as real as us
I bought a house I bill in bud
I can't believe it ain't legal yet
But I'mma sell it since it's still a drug
They call me Cy Young cause everybody know I'm pitchin'
You can tell when you walk inside my kitchen
All you see is

[Hook: Cyhi The Prince]

[Verse 2: Cyhi The Prince]
I'm the man with them OZ's
My plug call me Wizard
Shawty I got some purp
And I got some killer
To you it smell like gas
But to me it smell like vanilla
And all my Bud Light
Cause I don't fuck with Miller
Not liquor, Reggie
I keep a bag of them veggies
If you take the P off his last name
I'm into grass like Teddy
I twist the sack like spaghetti
Getting money out the ass I got a wedgie
Why you mad, I don't owe you jack son that's Jesse
Got a six pack in my chevy
That's what I call a muscle car
I ain't talking 'bout dope shawty
When I say that I hustle hard
Just the other day I sent my girl to the Target
For some tissue and some soap for our apartment
Plus I need some

[Hook: Cyhi The Prince]
Food savers and scissors Yeah
Food savers and scissors
We use it so they can't smell shit
And it make it safe to deliver
I specialize in trees nigga
Everyday is like Christmas I need

Figg, worldwide nigga but I'm Figg dope

10 racks, hundred shows, one mil
Mixtape on Billboard, fuck my deal
Sold a little weed a lot of oxy pills
Some turned snitch while my lips were sealed
Feds want me locked keep the nine appeal
I rather look strapped if the case for real
Bang the thumper 'fore they bang the gavel
Grenade in the mouth for the nigga they tattle
Four hundred nigga yo I can't be mammal
Put my pipe down in Eve’s mouth fuck that apple
Rock to the tunes let us gangsta boggie
Sold everything crack cocaine and pussy
Snitches ? dope scale up under
Quite a few pounds she can fill a hummer
Call me Puff Daddy little bitch I'm flashy
Matte Black Benz man that bitch look ashy
Granddaddy kush man I love my grams
Fuck all pigs but I'm going in H.A.M
