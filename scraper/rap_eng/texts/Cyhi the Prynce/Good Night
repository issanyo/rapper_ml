Yea! CyHi!
Stone Mountain-Decatur in the Motherfucker, Ok!

[Verse 1]
It's the night before tomorrow
I need a trifling ho to borrow
Cuz I just broke up with my bitch
But I ain't the type to mope and sob
Ok I can't lie it hurt my heart
But I seen the writing on the wall
But it's Friday though, and I'm ridin' slow
With a light skin ho from Cobb
They say that life is no facade
And the righteous go to God
While all the blacks go to prison
For that white shit known as hard
And I apologize if one of my guys
Take your wife with no regards
But it's money over bitches
Ain't no fightin' over broads
Cuz they see we poppin' tags
Meaning shoppin' bags
Drivin' fast with a lot of cash
TVs coming out the dash
Got a full tank in these streets
But I still gotta stop for gas
By South Dekalb, I'm talkin Keisha
You ain't even got to ask

[Hook: Marian Mereba]
I swear to God it's gonna be a good night
Ain't about that bullshit so my nigga don't try it
'Til the moon and the sun switch places in the sky
Wake up to the afternoon light
We had a good night, good night, good night, good night
'Til the moon and the sun switch places in the sky
Wake up to the afternoon light

[Verse 2]
Ok! As the plot thickens the pot twistin
The shit smell like a pot of chitlins
When we leave we parking lot pimpin'
Til your partner tell you that the cops trippin'
Tell the waitress bring a lot of lemons
To the section with a lot of women
Where the guys are chillin' and we high ceilings
Young Prynce but i ride with villians
So we just tryin' to have a nice time
Drinking brown or the white kind
Met a girl who leavin' outta town at like nine
She gone make me change her flight on priceline
She speak patois from the islands of Nassau
Can't believe her ass is that soft
You the finest hats off
The DJ just said last call
Can't stand a chick who act all
Stuck up, 'til they see them fast cars
Then they run up on the window and we...mash off
Before I fuck you bitch I rather jack off
Shit, I just thought you was cute that's all
We about to have a after party in our backyard
20 chicks on the way and they all bad yall

[Hook](2x)
