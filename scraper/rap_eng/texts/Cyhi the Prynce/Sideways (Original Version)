[Intro]

Man, everywhere I go, man
These niggas be frownin' their faces here and shit
Somethin' wrong with these niggas

[Verse 1: Cyhi Da Prince]
Soon as I pull up the driveway
With a bad bitch standin bout 5'8"
Around my waist, where I stay
Niggas irate, cause I skate
Like Stevie Williams tryna reach a million
Niggas showin' love when I reach the building
Sold out shows at East Pavillion
Probably with yo bitch if she's appealing
My car ain't a house, why I need a ceiling
If she at the crib, then he is drilling
Run up on me then the heat is spilling
Why you mad, nigga you could barely feed your chillun
If that's yo girl, why she revealing
Her deeper feelings about me instillin
This dick in her, then fix dinner
Put my login, but I don't hit enter
Whats wrong? You supposed to be the big spender
Pussy nigga you should go and switch genders
You a female, I get weed mail
Got so much work I need 3 scales
Take the whip to go an get detailed
And hit Houston's I eat well
But I gotta ride with the 4-5
They don't like me, and I don't know why

[Hook]
Them haters lookin' at me
Sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin' at me
Sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin' at me
Sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin' at me
Sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin' at me

[Verse 2: Cyhi Da Prince]
They lookin', they lookin'
Police think they cookin'
I sell it but I shouldn't
If I was rich trust me, I wouldn't
I'm not a woman beater
But Keisha is who I'm pushin
Sold a hundred pounds only one of them was tookin
If I see them, then I'm bookin' like I got a show in Brooklyn
Buy some powder and some Kush'n
And a pistol in the glove department
With a fuckin loaded cartridge for cowards that's woofin
If they pay me a million to be you for a minute,I wouldn't
I'm just a boy in the hood, who got that Cuban Goodin'
I sold it for the 5 even though they said I couldn't
They call me Mr. TAX-A-BLOCK
First not cause I rap alot
I can see that I rap a burn way faster than I rap a block
Plus this thing on my hip, force a nigga to have to hop
My partners like mechanics, you should see how fast they jack a car
They try to tap my phone, so I threw my celly out
And when I leave the crib mad, can somebody tell me why?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cyhi Da Prince]
Suckers hate so they screw-face
I'm hi-to-def, no Blu Ray
I'm shy as hell, no Lupe
I'm Bobby Cox, too Brave
Ride around in my new shades
Clock two tres for my crusade
All my bullets fly with tips
Just like T, I do clay
I'm on the way to the UK
Niggas do say I'm the new Jay
I'm so polished, low mileage
I'm a fresh man, but I don't go to college
And I don't own a stylus
But I was on the violet
When I'm on the pilot
Like a DVD when I feed the streets
My songs is burnin' like Eazy-E
Now you mad cause your girl wanna be with me
And you know I'mma bang her like a Jeezy beat
I see you hatin' you don't need to speak
You can have her back, I don't need the freak
Before a little nigga even get a chance to reach his peak...

[Hook]
