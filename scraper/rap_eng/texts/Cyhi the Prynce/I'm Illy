[Verse 1]
Y'all can hate the prince, but every bar real
Cus you tender like the man behind the bar is
I'm the coolest cat since Garfield
I'm international, the people call me Hartsfield
So pa chill, for now I'm underground like the hog is
But when the fog clears, you gon' hear me clearly like you listening with dog ears
Yo career dying quickly, dog years
Cus all year I was clean wit my team
And I did it with the green like Paul Pierce
Chrome .38 shining like the car grill
Squeeze once make a sucka do a cartwheel
But sticks and stones don't break my bones
So if I leave with a cut or a crush, nigga scars heal
These rappers say they G's, but never went to jail
And you say they harder than Prince Cydel
I'm like some ace of spades, they ain't even ginger ale
Plus I'm so intelligent I could've went to Yale
I'm illy take P-H off of Philly, or take the C-H off of chilly
No matter how you spell it, nigga I'm the shit and you can smell it
I'm so angelic, you the Devil I can tell it
Got a plug in Cisco, he said that he can mail it
I ain't gotta inhale it to tell you if I can sell it
And I ain't never been jealous
But if you are, my revolver spit pellets
But I roll with a bunch of pirates
I'm past being ill, pussy nigga I got a virus
