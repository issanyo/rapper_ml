[CyHi]
Yeah, okay, huh

[Verse 1: CyHi]
I woke up on the right side of the mattress, no really the right side of the mattress
And to My left is a pillow case covered in mascara, that's the results of a night out with an actress
Bad bitch, lavish life, not average, celebrate green everyday, St. Patrick
Pool hall money, I gotta lot racks prick, hood rat chick, bypass her like gastric
How many ladies can my Cadillac fit, score three times in one night that's a hat trick
Fact is, all I do is cut them like a bad brick, give them food a fat dick, and really that's it
No stress, so blessed, four bands for the purp no less
And its louder then a Corvette, plus the trunk singing like a Quartet
If success had a house I'll be on his door step, spaceship whip, son I'm on a George jet
Next to my dick yeah that's where you whore slept, I woke up to egg whites and salmon croquettes
Then I back to having more sex, I'm taking off my shirt, she taking off her corset
Then I hit record next, I ain't never been reserved baby, that's a war vet

[Hook: CyHi]
First I clean the white walls of a sled, take a shower, and get fresh
(I woke up on the right side of the bed)
I hit the mall with my dogs spend some bread, some niggas wake up in the feds but I
(I woke up on the right side of the bed)

[Verse 2: CyHi]
I surround myself with peaceful people, its hard to get sleep when you're peeps deceitful
Blowing trees of diesel in my big house, my shit look like a cathedral
Walk around in my boxers, money in my dockers, I been had my check-up, I'm always at the doctor
Stuffed lobster, mushroom pasta, a bunch of Spanish chicks, I gotta learn how to salsa
Where I wanna go, I'm headed to the port, Lake Tahoe, that's my first resort
All are meals are five course, got my niggas working for me, fire crackers like the fourth
Living well in my citadel, hit the nightclub, leave with a nigga gal
With a caravan, now we on Air France, business class, coach look like first class on AirTran
I gotta lot of deals on the table, doing business with my furniture, I'm talking to the chairman
I don't slack, that's a pair of pants, with this country music, so lets square dance

[Hook: CyHi]
First I clean the white walls of a sled, take a shower, and get fresh
(I woke up on the right side of the bed)
I hit the mall with my dogs spend some bread, some niggas wake up in the feds but I
(I woke up on the right side of the bed)
Blowing money, you can't ball when you're dead, left the club, caught a broad, got some head
My sheets is twelve hundred thread, I spent seven on spread, now I know why you're girl
(Woke up on the right side of the bed)
