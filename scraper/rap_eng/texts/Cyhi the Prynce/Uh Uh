[Intro]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Yung Lan on the track

[Chorus]
Uh uh, uh uh

Uh uh, uh uh
Young nigga run up and flex
Uh uh, uh uh

Uh uh, uh uh
And I don't know who next
Uh uh, uh uh
I can't wife no ho
Uh uh, uh uh
Bitch can't hit my door
Uh uh, uh uh
Homeboy done hit that flow
Uh uh, uh uh
Bitch say I'm low down, so?

[Verse 1]
I got a nasty ho
I got a bitch so thick, she a classy ho
Shit, embarrass a ho
She'll pull up with the shit, she'll stab a ho
My lil' sassy ho
Ho gon' love me to death 'til the casket blow
I'm a savage ho
Don't try talk to my bitch, I'ma blast a ho
(Yeah) Ride my bitch 'til the end, I wanna fuck on your friend (uh uh)
Ho, I fuck with your kin, they lemme sleep in the den

(Yeah) I ain't been the same since
Them niggas shot up my Benz (uh uh)
I'ma hit 'em with the bang
Photoshoot, no lense

[Chorus]
Uh uh, uh uh
I do this shit for my set
Uh uh, uh uh
Young nigga run up and flex
Uh uh, uh uh
I don't know who got stretched
Uh uh, uh uh
And I don't know who next
Uh uh, uh uh
I can't wife no ho
Uh uh, uh uh
Bitch can't hit my door
Uh uh, uh uh
Homeboy done hit that flow
Uh uh, uh uh
Bitch say I'm low down, so?

[Verse 2]
You know I play by my ho
Ho, I'm cutthroat, I been settin' the blow
Momma ain't raise no ho
I done shot so many niggas in front of the store
You ain't talkin' 'bout no money
Ho, you can go, ho, you better hit that door
Ho, I'm a boss, I'm up
And you know, you gotta go down low
Yeah, I got some real killas with me
Which nigga goin' through the door? (uh uh)
I'm in the shake shake joint, I got some ones on the floor (uh uh)
How you strippin' on yo' period?
You lil' triflin' ho (uh uh)
Momma always told me "son, you can't wife a ho"

[Chorus]
Uh uh, uh uh
I do this shit for my set
Uh uh, uh uh
Young nigga run up and flex
Uh uh, uh uh
I don't know who got stretched
Uh uh, uh uh
And I don't know who next
Uh uh, uh uh
I can't wife no ho
Uh uh, uh uh
Bitch can't hit my door
Uh uh, uh uh
Homeboy done hit that flow
Uh uh, uh uh
Bitch say I'm low down, so?
