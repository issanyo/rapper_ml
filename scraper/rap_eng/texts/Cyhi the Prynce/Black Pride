[Intro: CyHi The Prynce]
Yeah, how ya'll doing out there? Ok, ok
Well, I'm CyHi The Prynce
Also known as Cydel Young
Hey!

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
I wanna thank y'all for coming out
Especially shawty over there with her stomach out
Nigga, this the closest thing to the Chronic album
Roll a blunt of loud while you look at mama's youngest child
Perform in front of crowds
Shout out to the funny style
Niggas who went broke cause they didn't let they money pile
Got a hundred thou', more beef than a hundred cows
And bullshit walk a hundred miles
Haters run they mouth till my niggas come and stomp 'em out
Don't make us turn a house party to a haunted house
I love your honest smile, baby girl, you look stunning, wow
If you brought me home I bet you'd make your mama proud
Cause ever since you wrote your number down
We've been dating for the past three summers now
Remember when we used to give each other the runaround?
But, fuck the past, I'm just glad that you're my woman now

[Hook: Kissielee & CyHi The Prynce]
I'm so proud of us, I'm so proud of us
Made something out of nothing, from the streets where we were hustling
I'm so proud of us, I'm so proud of us
From the traps that we were stuck in, no more pain and no more suffering

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
We went from hustlers to business men
From tryna tell the judge that I'm innocent
They tryna send a thug into oblivion
Sometimes I wish I was a kid again
When I was a child- I think that's first Corinthians
My dad raised me to be a world class Olympian
Back when Puff was "All About The Benjamins"
I took 'em Fresh Prince like, 'where the fuck is Vivian?'
Cutlass with the tint on it, cut in the Caribbean
Chick who got a man but you know I wasn't feeling it
Get that boy the boot, what's a love to a timberland?
Tell him he a scrub, come make love with a gentleman
She sucking my amphibian, I'm kissing at her knees
She mixed with Japanese so I say hello to the kitty then
They know me down in Africa, I'm like the Prime Meridian
We can't find a club big enough to fit the city in so

[Hook: Kissielee & CyHi The Prynce]
I'm so proud of us, I'm so proud of us
Made something out of nothing, from the streets where we were hustling
I'm so proud of us, I'm so proud of us
From the traps that we were stuck in, no more pain and no more suffering

[Verse 3: Miloh Smith]
And it should be the sound of us
CyHi The Prynce so you know we brought the town with us
You know I do it out of love cause I'm proud of us
South the joint, now I wanna give the crown to us
We keep it real in the field, still whips and chains
But fall back, abort that, the [sentence?] is lame
Left the scars on my arm, there should be no lie
But we tru soldiers and we don't die, against black power
Before we sober I'mma get back ours
Been living like it's my last minute the past hour
I know they mad now that I came up, while you sitting your ass down
And may not be the first king of Ebenezer
People saying that there will never be another leader
Every reason to make you a believer, ain't you a believer?
Yeah, keep praying for freedom- Peace!

[Hook: Kissielee & CyHi The Prynce]
I'm so proud of us, I'm so proud of us
Made something out of nothing, from the streets where we were hustling
I'm so proud of us, I'm so proud of us
From the traps that we were stuck in, no more pain and no more suffering

[Bridge: Kissielee]
Baby, there's no need to tell ya
As far as I can see we were stars back when we were struggling
Now we don't have to worry at all
And you can tell everybody that doubted us
We went from being underdogs now everybody wanna be like us
But it's just me and you baby, I'm so proud of us
It's just me and you baby, I'm so proud of us
It's just me and you baby, I'm so proud of us
It's just me and you baby, I'm so proud of us

[Hook: Kissielee & CyHi The Prynce]
I'm so proud of us, I'm so proud of us
Made something out of nothing, from the streets where we were hustling
I'm so proud of us, I'm so proud of us
From the traps that we were stuck in, no more pain and no more suffering
