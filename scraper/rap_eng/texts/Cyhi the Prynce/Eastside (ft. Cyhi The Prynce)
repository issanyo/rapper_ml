O Ol’ Old School

Verse 1 Tommie King:
Hit stu body bag that booth/
Swag rap ina hazmat suit/
When I’m gone they’ll be geekin’ I had statues/
Introduced that ex that she had tattooed/
That dude ol skool man I slide by creep slow/
If she fine beep beep tho/
One of those 3 deep in a Jeep hoes/
Look, I could take ya out to eat lemme’ beat though/
Pull up in ya’ dream car w/ ya’ dream hoe/
Body bad, hour glass/
Yo b*tch like a ten piece mild all flats/
Body look steam-rolled/
Me? Gotta be the hottest think about it I’m/
Always accompanied by a goddess, I’m/
Best unsigned in the booth and I sing though amazed by a king they ain’t seen my team tho/
Anytime I speak that’s a key-note/
TP roll full of c-notes/
Anytime I sneeze that’s a kilo/
Make a tape with a dime like it’s b-roll/
Mirror on the ceiling it feed my ego/
“When you become star will you still need me though?”/
Nah, b*tch I got that je ne sais quoi/
Flow diamond hard, born to be star/
Still bench seats when a king ride/
Same lil ol king from the Eastside/
Still face three fives let a beat ride peak high lookin’ like I got two pink eyes/
Eastside Peach state/
Look how far we came/
Kingshit, RF over everything/

Hook:
Ol-ol Skool, Eastside/
Skatin tall in that Ol skool/
Where the trap is god/
Ol-ol Skool, Eastside/
Skatin tall in that Ol skool/
Where the trap is god/
Ol-Ol skool Eastside/
Skatin tall in that Ol skool/

CyHi Verse 2:

Eastside Eastside/
We ride we ride/
Old skool no shoes/
FILA FILA/
I ain’t got on no suit, but I got street ties/
Three five three five/
We high we high/
Know how we ride, and I stay with the gun too/
In the club do my 1-2/
Tell a stripper that I want you/
Tell ya’ lil’ friend she could come too/
Let’s dip nigga fondue/
Cause soon as you get your first prezi/
Niggas wanna’ do you like John Booth/
It’s kind of ironic, I been lookin’ at the moon through the sun-roof/
She wanna be my woman but first I gotta see how many hoops she could jump through/
Bi*tch sweet like junk food/
Probly heard a lot about me that was untrue/
I don’t remember ever being uncool/
21 I had house with a dumb pool/
Please don’t let one of my niggas trunk you/
Catch a body like a fan of a punk group/
She said her ex was a nightmare, I said girl relax dreams come true/
Don’t trip we straight/
And it’s like 3A/
M in the morning, on the freeway in GA/
