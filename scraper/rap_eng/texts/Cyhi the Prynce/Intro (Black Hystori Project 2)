Verse 1
I heard some niggas thinkin' 'bout attackin' me
I keep some cats with me that turn to killers for your majesty
Semi-automatic let a nigga have it
Like he asked to borrow it and he ain't ever give it back to me
The audacity, I pull out like a cavity
Since a snaggle teeth little boy full of agony
Like the slave owner's gun, I'm a masterpiece
I treat my shotty like a boom box, it's full of batteries
It's blasphemy to stand here and rap about my salary
This is for the workin' class people at them factories
Stone Mountain, nigga, IVY State is my academy
And I used to go to church up the street from McAfee
But I swear the street life'll captivate a nigga
Have you weighin' work on your calculator, nigga
I swear I have so many yellow bitches
If you put 'em in a room, look like the Packers played the Steelers
Y'all hate a nigga more than what these crackers hate a nigga
Y'all just lookin' for the perfect time to 'sassinate a nigga
Meet me in the jungle, better have an alligator with you
If it's cow then this .40 Cal'll calibrate a nigga, huh
Speedin' through the night like it's Talladega, nigga
Thousand pounds of mid came in on a tractor trailer
With a duffle bag full of money cause you gotta pay the dealer
I've done seen it all and I ain't have to touch a milli
Gram of the yams, goin' ham on the cameras
Say that I'm the realest, I just say I am what I am
Flow like water, give a damn 'bout a dam
If I see them cops, nigga, like Cam I'ma scram
Cause you wanna get peanut butter and jam when you're jammed
Section 8 and some food stamps for your fam
You can't study for this test, you can't cheat on life exams
When you good with the sheep, ain't no need to buy a Lamb
Nigga
