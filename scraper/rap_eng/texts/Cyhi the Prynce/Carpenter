[Intro]
Cyhi
Yeah
Scottdale in this bitch
Eastside
Like, yall should be happy I made it from Redan road
I'm doing this shit for us
Ya hear me

[Verse 1]
Stone Mountain nigga, stayed off of Biffle
Damn near made 20k off the nickels
Used to trap now I'm getting paid off the riddles
Lil nigga whatever you done made I done trippled
From the suburbs to the hood, I was raised in the middle
Either go to school or catch a stray from a pistol
I remember catching plays by the crystal
Tryna get a date and getting played by Crystal
But it's all good though, cuz all the hood hoes
From Snapfinger all the way to Allgood Road
Want a young prince to take em to the crib
With the California King and the hardwood floors
Cuz I'm balling like the NBA, and my new broad got her MBA
She could've been an anchor on NBC
But she told me that she wanted Oprah Winfrey cake (ha)
Well I guess I'm Steadman
Blowing headband like Method Man and Redman
Got the room smokey like Craig friend
Purple green, I'm rolling up a eggplant
Got more girls than the college off of West End
Niggas jealous of me, that's why I tote a FN
But I'm living life to the fullest
Cuz if you don't, you better off dead then
