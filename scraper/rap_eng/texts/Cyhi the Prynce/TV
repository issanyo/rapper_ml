[Verse 1]
Girl you looking at an East Atlanta
Nigga with some decent manners
But in the sheets, I’m a beast to handle
I’m talking sex in the living room, looking at repeats of Scandal
Drinking Remy, watching Martin, come and be my Tisha Campbell
First we gon need the camera, hope you didn’t bring pajamas
It’s hard to sit calm when you’re wetter than the English Channel
Like the HBO show, Imma make you sing soprano
Never been a family guy, but ever son needs his Sanford
So if we get married with children just know I’m ready and willing
Tell Peggy I’m feeling like it’s a different world
Since we were freshmen at Hillman
Let’s make some home improvements, I’m talking 80 foot ceilings
I need a bitch with an ass, and some hair that’s Brazilian
Not the type to get mad or jealous with the rest of the women
Them black bottles is coming, Prince of Bel-Air’s in the building
I’m going home with Topanga, what an incredible feeling

[Hook]
We having sex with the TV on [x4]

[Verse 2]
They say if you watch CNN and SportsCenter
While you having sex you’re more likely to put a boy in her
Who would you rather fuck than a future Grammy award winner
Spend your Christmas on an island, you gon have a short winter
But all you watch is VH1 and BET
Fuck a reality show, it’s already hard enough being me
But in the B E D, you the bomb baby, TNT
Brain so good she helped a nigga get a GED
[?], I know you’re tired of living single
So fuck with me baby, I’ll put a ring on every finger
In relationships I seen it all, I feel like Jerry Springer
Or like Steve Harvey the first time he met Regina
So, let’s make our Saturday night live
Everybody hates Cris, so we order white wine
And we all yell cheers, after that get your coat
So we can go somewhere remote, different strokes for different folks

[Hook]

[Sample - Stevie Wonder]
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you, but I love you

[Verse 3]
I thought this was love at first sight
Even though we fucked on the first night
But I was so naive so I
Thought I'd write you this song before I leave
You was young and I thought that I could change you
I ain't from New England but I thought that I could main you
I'm thankful that we broke up cause it was painful
Like kids on my taxes, I thought that I could claim you
And you walked around like you Mama's little angel
