[Verse 1: Cyhi The Prynce]
I keep a circle like a roller rink
I'm a kush addict, im a doja fiend
CauseI got partners in the pen and some nigga's in the gutter
Guess you can say I'm bowling green
But I ain't from Kentucky
Got a big booty chick with a frame like Buffie
Get brain like a skully
My bitch roll up everytime we finish fucking
Cause she's trained like a puppy
I couldn't give a damn about the lame nigga trust me
Haters talk shit but they better not touch me
RIP to the homie M-bone
Nowadays niggas can't even do the dougie
Without a hater trying to leave you bloody
While you smoking Mary Jane with your buddies
So I keep a Smith like my first it was lovie
Cause they wanna ride on me like the frame on a huffy
So I smoke weed just to ease my mind
But it's hard to complain when your chief 5 blind
This is for the potheads who be three five buyin'
Gettin so high you can see mount Zion
Where I'm from I'm E lot of the east side giant
Cause I won the championship for the best blunt roller in our time

[Hook]
First I split the blunt
Then I dump the guts
I ask the person standing next to me
To hold my cup,while I'm rolling up
Rolling up,rolling up
Security on my neck, but I don't give a fuck
I can't believe they tried to throw a nigga out the club
Just for rolling up,rolling up

[Verse 2]
I'm out here tryin' to stay alive
Rolling 'til the day I die
Smoking on a Juicy J, pulled up bumping playa fly
We driving in all the fastest whips
And I got a half a zip
Riding with my gangster Boo
She open like a bag of chips
She's so fine she don't have to strip
Grab a stack I have to tip
After that I had her back
At the bachelor pad with a sack of piff
A trapper's gift ,the sexy ho with the ass and hips
Who come over to smoke a blunt
And let a nigga smash instead

[Hook]
