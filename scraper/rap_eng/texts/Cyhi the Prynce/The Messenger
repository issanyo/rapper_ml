[Verse]
I'm 26 still a vet in my sport
I got jury duty so I wore my necklace to court
I'm going ham so I invested in pork
I'm bout my green so I'm finna catch a jet to New York
Old school Chevy with a tork
Cell phone on my hip right next to the torch
You step on my porch I suggest you abort
Desert Eagle kick back like the  leg on the horse
My bitches is bi my dishes is tie
I'm falunt with a blunt bitch I live in the sky
Cuz I'm burning dro on 24s
That's how all my niggas roll
Pimpin' hoes like PSC
Get with the joystick then play her like the PS3
Then jump inside the EXT
Ya bitch easy like A,B,C,D,E,F,G
