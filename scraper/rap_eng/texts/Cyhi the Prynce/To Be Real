[Intro]
Y'all niggas don't know how

[Verse 1]
These haters wanna impede my grind before I reach my prime
It's like I turned my face upside down, I'ma speak my mind
What I look like beefing with you niggas? I don't even like swine
And these rappers remind me of Siegfried & Roy, cause you niggas like lying
So truthfully I don't fuck with y'all
I ain't tryna hit the club with y'all
Shit I even had to cut my cousin off
Cause in the streets it's no love involved
Won't hang with niggas, don't trust the broad
And I don't like police
So my wife gotta be a only child
Cause I don't even wanna have a brother-in-law
I'm too real for these fake folks
Y'all the wolves in sheep clothing
So I guess that makes me the scapegoat
Like a screen door, you niggas stay broke
From what the ho's say I ain't Cuervo
For the Pesos we can go to war
Like the Union soldiers in the gray coats
My latest show at the Masquerade was the only time I sold out
I can't hear you haters talkin' cause this weed we smoking is so loud
These rap niggas go no style
All they talk about is a dope house
Poor child, you don't even know how to be real

Damn bruh just be yourself man
You ain't gotta rap like these nigga
These nigga flossin' and flawging anyway
It's cool to be you cuz
Fuck these niggas
You feel me

[Hook] (x2)
These niggas don't know how
These niggas don't know how to be real
These haters don't know how
These haters don't know how I feel

[Verse 2]
A lot of local niggas don't like me
I be somewhere out of town on 'em
Treat haters like trampolines
When I seem 'em I bounce on 'em
I don't smile in peoples face
And when they leave talk down on 'em
And if your so called friend was your fingers
You still couldn't count on 'em
Rather be broke being myself
Than to be rich being somebody else
Did it on my own, didn't nobody help
Only God knows all the Os I done dealt
Make a bad bitch put her nose by my belt
Call me pool table, all the hoes I done felt
Walked in the house, all the dope I done smelt
I swear I done seen so much coke I could belch on the road to wealth
See people cheat the game
I just want the money, I don't need the fame
So we already talking 'bout money
You can keep your two cents shawty, we don't need the change
Homie you ain't gotta be a street nigga
If you wanna come around me and hang
The only thing I require from you is loyalty and you got to be real

For real shawty, only real niggas around me
We keep in one hunnid over here
Better yet one thousand
A lot of y'all don't know how to do that though
Leggo

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro]
Y'all niggas don't know how (x15)
