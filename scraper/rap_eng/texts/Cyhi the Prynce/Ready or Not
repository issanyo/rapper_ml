[Intro: CyHi The Prynce]
Huh, yeah, the Port-au-Prince
Cy posse
Shouts out to Haiti, man
My prayers go out to y'all
Hey

[Verse 1]
First I want to say god bless the lady who made me
I do this for the babies in Haiti
Go trade your Mercedes up to the [aid?]
Where Wyclef is, the Yele
So I mix the cognac with the Baileys
Back in the eighties they gave us crack to push us back into slavery
Rap just happened to save me, fuck moving packs
Niggas get jacked on the daily, laying on their back up in Grady
Seen what happened to Tracy, all for the cash money
But nothing ever happens to Baby, run the trap like McGahee
You soon be trapped in the cage, B, only 'cause half of us lazy

But should I act the same way? It's two pillows in my bed
One is where the thing lay, I don't sling yay'
'Cause how would you feel, if you was a kid in this neighborhood and can't play?
They say it ain't safe, 'cause it's the same place where they say the gangs stay
Either you go to school or you bang A
There's so much to life other than cutting white
I hear gunshots every motherfucking night
Keep a thirty-eight, and I tuck it tight
Niggas raise your kids, don't put no bitch above your wife
'Cause once a woman's fed up, it's hard to love you twice
I speak the truth, even if it don't rub you right

[Chorus] (x2)
Ready or not, here I come, I've arrived
Now it's time to tell the people something

[Verse 2]
So could every body stand for the ruler? I even got fans in Aruba
Blood diamonds, people lose their hand for your jeweler
Just so you and your man can look cooler, split the band on the Ruger
No, I ain't planning to user her, but if I have to
I'll stand there and shoot you, your homies'll do you
The one's who act phony'll screw you and they ain't the only intruders
Also, the [Jack?] boys want you dead 'cause
They heard you manage birds like Tony La Russa, haha

But still show love to your loved ones
Instead of hugging your partners, we'd rather hug guns
Sit back and watch the blood run, friendship disappear like Louisiana flood funds
Niggas better get their Lugz on, it's a war going on outside, don't catch a slug son
Father forgive us, most of all of us dealers
Niggas who can't seem to keep their fingers off of the triggers
Throw your dog in the river 'cause he involved with them killers
And they killed Timmy, he was only the middle man
For fifty pounds of Reggie Miller
But I am not a follower, that's probably why I ain't got any twitter fans
In the A they don't give a damn, this the New Jack City
But these niggas ain't trying to [pill a van?]

[Chorus]
