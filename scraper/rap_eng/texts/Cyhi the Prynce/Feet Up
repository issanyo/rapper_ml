[Intro: CyHi Talking]
A lot of muthafuckas gon' ask me where I've been
Ya know, I'm workin' fool
Don't worry about me, I'm chillin', I'm good
Get it? I'm good
I got my feet up somewhere coming up with some dope shit like this
Ya feel me?

[Verse 1]
Whatchu know about a manicure and pedicure?
Shawty, you won't understand until your brain mature
I dress Couture and you can rest assure
I only fuck a bitch once, then act like I never knew her
Unless the head is pure, I keep the best manure
Treat every nigga like the Feds cause you're never sure
Top down in the summertime
Smellin' like Bond No.9 with a foreign dime
Haters see me bend the corner in the Coupe DeVille
Barbequin' ass niggas, all y'all do is grill
Claimin' they got beef but I don't do the ribs
But this baby .380 in my lap will shoot you through the crib
Your girl treat me like a pacifier
Then I make her come first like an appetizer
When I'm done, I smoke a sack of fire
Now I'm chillin' on the couch with my...

[Hook]
Feet up
Feet up
I get money everyday
I'm chillin' with my
Feet up
Feet up
In a different country everyday
From Spain back to the A

[Verse 2]
Most niggas who get it fast, always finish last
School of Hard Knocks and they didn't pass
Never went to college to be a business major
But when I fly, they keep puttin' me in business class
Probably because I'm gettin' cash
I don't know a stripper in Atlanta that I didn't smash
These niggas hurtin' cause they broke, put 'em in a cast
We shop at Saks Fifth, you shop at Jimmy Jazz
Balenciaga, Louis, Fendi, Prada
Semi automatic, I don't have too many problems
I'm in Nan's, I'm in Houston's, I'm in Benihana's
I be fresh as hell, even when I'm in pajamas
I ain't chillin' in the hood, cause I ain't with the drama
"We barely see you CyHi!", barely see my Momma
I'm with the biggest artist in the world, and that's in any genre
I'm somewhere smokin' marijuana with my...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'm ridin' in my 'Lac
Just me and my .380
Smokin' somethin good
Finna go and pick up this broad
And she might be your lady
We gon' drink and roll some kush
Now I got her in my bed with her...

[Hook]
