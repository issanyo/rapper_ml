Indiana

Intro: [Aneesa Badshaw]

I was born to love but cursed to feel
Me and the devil made a deal
Maybe in time I will eventually heal

Intro: [Cyhi The Prynce]

What up Jon Hay
Okay

Verse 1: [Cyhi The Prynce]

Riding down 74
Listening to this heavenly flow
The devil telling me no
But that’s just poison Bell Biv Devoe
Since you broke you should sell me your soul
Whoa
That’s one hell of an ultimatum
This how me and the devil talk verbatim
Pacing back and forth off this Colt 45
Fell asleep outside of Lucas Oil Stadium
Then I woke up, still hungover silly
That’s when I realize I got four ounces of purple with me
Now I’m back to running circles ‘round the circle city
Hah
Just meet me outside of circle city

Chorus: [Iliana Eve, Cyhi The Prynce, Faincarter]

Ooohh, ooohh
(Now I’m back to running circles ‘round the circle city)
Ooohh, ooohh
(I got love for my city I’m a Hoosier glady)
Ooohh, ooohh
(Listening to this heavenly flow)
Ooohh, ooohh
(Meet me outside of circle city)

Verse 2: [Faincarter]

Gordon on the track, Indy 500 flow
In the booth, ‘bout to lay 500 mo’
Just made my way back from a Cali show
Shit was moving slow but now I hit the pass and go
Nigga I’m so Indiana feeling like Jones
Jimmy Fallon late night do this night long
I got love for my city, I’m a Hoosier gladly
I be on the women like girl, "who’s your daddy?"
Cruisin’ 465 with your girl inside
She want to sixty-nine in my 69’
Like a kid on big wheels ‘round the circle city
Just meet me outside the circle city


Chorus: [Iliana Eve, Cyhi The Prynce, Faincarter]

Ooohh, ooohh
(Now I’m back to running circles ‘round the circle city)
Ooohh, ooohh
(I got love for my city I’m a Hoosier glady)
Ooohh, ooohh
(Listening to this heavenly flow)
Ooohh, ooohh
(Meet me outside of circle city)
