[Verse 1:CeeJ]

Quit all the mushy talk
These pussies looking up to me, bitch I'm a rookie boss
I take an L to the face but I never took a loss
I swear I work for the paper, I never took 'em off
Days (Daze), it's like they in a haze, they stuck on my name
Shit I'm quick-witted, this Brick City jungle I BANG
Looking for 6 figure digits man I'm stuck in my ways
Puffing away, thinking of ways I can double my gains
Which of you made(maid) niggas gonna uncover my fame
Cause all you lame hoes flows just puzzle my brain
Ever since I came up in the door I been fucking the game
But now I love her she get some of every rubber I bring
But first thing that's gon' come?...The Prenup
1-5-0's a little bit hard to re-up
Snotty ass nose a little bit hard to clean up
I'm tryna get to the mill with more than 50 to kill, and still
We chillin' on a whole 160
Me and three of my niggas got a 40, hella tipsy
You boys coming out for my fame, nigga don't tempt me
Y'all bored (board) and y'all think this a game? That's hella Risky
I'm taking Christine, we going to Tiffany's
And we ain't buying jewelry, 2 bitches with me
I guess it's S&M when they impressed with the Benz
I just sit in the back, 2 bitches whip me

And this is how its going down
Yezzir
Its like....
Bang
It's like
Bang, Bang

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
CyHi the Prynce, fresh up out the Ivy League
Nigga I'm the bomb, bitches call me IED
Probably cause I'm covered in all this I-C-E
I asked her can I fuck, she said Y-E-P
I'm blowing up like C4
Overseas tours, man I used to be poor
Sound like grenades every time I record
All I do is drop bombs, Marine Corps

[Verse 3: CeeJ]
Getting paid is keeping me on
So I can look her in the face, believe in me Moms
I just hit the same fucking stage Khalifa was on
And Hunger Pains got a shot, the heat in my palms
How can I see Miami beaches, the heat and the palms
Short spring break, lavish life for a week and I'm gone
Man I'm a king, every morning I beat the alarm
How I look shaking off a loss, this ain't Vietnam
Whoo man
My castle and you only act a fool man
And shit since I been on my grind like the school dance
Every weekend we peeking, they in love with the crew man
And I'm the crew chief, shit, we need a full tank
It's sad but rapping gon' get me money that school ain't
It's kind of backwards to me it seems like a cruel prank
But fuck it, I just roll up the good dank
Lighter in my hand, I'll ignite it for the FAM
Nigga what?

And this is how its going down
Yezzir
Its like....
Bang
It's like
Bang, Bang
