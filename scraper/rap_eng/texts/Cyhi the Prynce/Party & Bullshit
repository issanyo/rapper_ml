[Intro: CyHi The Prynce]
Going on a plane, chauffeur and a Benz
Go do a show and catch a party when it ends
Then I leave the club, shawty and her friend
Wake up in the morning and do it all again
Going on a plane, chauffeur and a Benz
Go do a show and catch a party when it ends
Then I leave the club, shawty and her friend
Wake up in the morning and do it all again

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
Nobody told me it would be like this, women and parties
Penthouse, Ferraris, numbers that I won't be calling
Just a goodbye, good evening, one of us should be leaving in the AM
What's your name? Say it again, she say Kim
I'm August, her body was flawless, boy shorts on, she topless
I'm 18, way too young, sipping on lean
I remember when I used to hustle, didn't have a dream
Now I'm in the club like just because I sing

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
This is dedicated to my niggas outchea getting it
Searching for a better situation than you living with
I'm a testimony, glad somebody gets to witness it
Now that I got off the hood, all I wanna do is

[Hook: August Alsina]
Party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit
All I wanna do is party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit
Like my nigga Biggie, party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit
All I wanna do is party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
I'm leaving party after party, sipping drink after drink
Couple of freaky broads doing real freaky things
Prolly shouldn't make decisions while I'm tipsy off that drink
But what chick tonight coming home and be tamed?
She say she has morals and that's never been her ways
She tell me 'bout how she's brought up she religious and she's saved
Mention a little money and the whole thang change
Story is turned up around she's another groupie
Tonight, tonight, let's party and bullshit
Alright, alright, girl show me what you working with
Baby take this shot, what you got on girl take that off
Move a little closer, tonight you fucking with a boss

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
This is dedicated to my niggas outchea getting it
Searching for a better situation than you living with
I'm a testimony, glad somebody gets to witness it
Now that I got off the hood, all I wanna do is

[Hook: August Alsina]
Party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit
All I wanna do is party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit
Like my nigga Biggie, party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit
All I wanna do is party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
Party, bullshit, all I do is cool shit
Still wouldn't save a ho if I was preaching in the pulpit
Got a city broad, got a rude bitch, got a 5 seven with a full clip
Didn't graduate but I made more money than a lot of niggas I went to school with
Up all night like a vampire, burn trees like a camp fire
Every song I make jamming, like a gun that can't fire
If I ain't hot, you a damn lie, doing shows, every night
Pockets fat, Berry white, red eye, every flight
A lot of interviews, cars with the 22's
Bottles in my sections and broads with the Jimmy Choos
Hotel room full of tennis shoes, working hard
Making business move but all y'all think I do is

[Hook: August Alsina]
Party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit
All I wanna do is party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit
Like my nigga Biggie, party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit
All I wanna do is party and bullshit, party and bullshit, party and bullshit
