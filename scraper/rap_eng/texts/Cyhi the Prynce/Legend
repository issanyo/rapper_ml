[Intro]
Is there something that I should know?
Yeah
I wish that you would tell me so
Don't keep me in the dark
CyHi
[?]

[Verse 1]
Your bitch dig my fresh on some La Di Da Di shit
She always on her knees like my Abu Dhabi bitch
Mix Capone with my uncle Ton and Maseratti Rick
Jimmy Henchman the only ones who could probably body this
Feel like I did 20, came home stuck in 96'
Never dropped a dime like Tiny Archibald comin' off the pick
How can y'all forget?
All the albums I done did
I'm an artist with no felonies can't tell me I'm not legit
I been spittin' real since real the real and floppy disk
I can see why all the copywriters try to copy this
My girl sayin' I'm hardly home
I get paid to rock these poems
Kick this shit off the dome
Like that Ronda Rousey chick
Black Conor McGregor, no losses under my records
But if I did and I see you again I'm coming to wreck ya
Treadmilling, I been running from karma forever
Legs killing
But I know that the lord is my shepherd
Lamb Peelin'
I just quote songs when I'm under pressure
Best feeling when you know god will come to your rescue
Just chilling
I be speaking in parables
Pulled a strap from up under my arm
Like it's parachute
Tryna steal these pair of shoes
Shhhh y'all wanna hear some scary news?
Its 8'o clock my partner just sprayed the block
Now he got the whole neighborhood hot
Thanks a lot
I'm with a Heather B and Tracy G
Tryna Sway the cop, I laid the plot
Told him he was next door at Jason's spot
That's the send off nigga
We was bad like Mike Jack' with the shinguards nigga
Thoughts go through my brain like a pinball nigga
You got your style off my style you a spin-off nigga
Barry Sanders
Two belts to carry hammers
Talking guns boy I gotta house full I'm Danny Tanner
I was the driver for the hitman's and Sammy Sammers
Heard a plenty stories about kidnappers and healthy ransoms
Ambulance'll pick you up better hope that your family answers
Lost a couple fights to 'em but still I'm fairly handsome
In Atlanta I swear I done fucked like every dancer
Off every word, my mouth red like cherry Fanta
Hail Mary! I'm Makavelli with every stanza
This note is a gift, written sincerely, Santa
The Legend

[Hook]
I'm a legend
I been that nigga in my town since I was seven
I'm a legend
Even when I'm not in Stone Mountain, feel the presence
I'm a legend
Before I started selling pounds of that lettuce
Before I had them 20's mounted on the Chevy
Today if God decide to send me back to heaven

[Verse 2]
Back when the Dolphins had Marino
I had thoughts of Palominos
Puttin my broad in Valentinos
I started baggin' dinos
My partner used to drop his Momma off at Bingo
Now we back to clocking C notes
We want the bread
We even tried to rob the Kinkos
Cause we heard they had a lotta paper
Can't sleep like I had twenty cappuccinos
Hope my past dont come back to haunt me like when Benny capped Pacino
Black Latinos
Bags of gasolino
Catch a bird to Oakland then we flying back to Reno
Some of y'all didn't catch the lingo
This is real trap shit
Keep the calculator like I'm bout to do a math quiz
Put the mustard on the turkey bag that's how we wrap shit
Before I did this rap shit, coulda been a draft pick
Rather hit a fast lick, always had a bad bitch
Who left me for a rich nigga
Cause I never had shit
But once she see how green the grass is
She'll be running back, after she done had kids
But can you blame her?
You see all the swag bitch?
Look at what my dad did
He raised a motherfucking legend!

[Hook]
I'm a legend
I been that nigga in my town since I was seven
I'm a legend
Even when I'm not in Stone Mountain, feel the presence
I'm a legend
Before I started selling pounds of that lettuce
Before I had them 20's mounted on that Chevy
Today if God decide to send me back to heaven
I'm motherfucking legend!
