[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
I can't let you niggas trick me off the streets
I can't let you niggas trick me off the streets
I don't wanna sell you nothin', pussy nigga talk is cheap
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets, huh
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets, aye
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets
Boy you might be a cop, you can't cop shit up off of me, huh
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
Okay, I made 750 off a P
On the phone with Mr. Kraft so I'm busy talking cheese
I don't fuck with white, I'm eating strictly off the weed
Cause I know them folks tryna strip me off the streets
So I, tighten up, had to switch my license, bruh
And I know the drought coming so I switch my prices up
I don't waste time so I lit my Breitling up
Why you niggas mad? Sammy Sosa, lighten up
And that skinny bitch you with, I can tell she tryna cut
If I put a baby in her, bet them hips'll widen up
You lame ass niggas can't get no 3-5 from us
Three point one four, cause you niggas pie as fuck, aye

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
I can't let you niggas trick me off the streets
I can't let you niggas trick me off the streets
I don't wanna sell you nothin', pussy nigga talk is cheap
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets, huh
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets, aye
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets
Boy you might be a cop, you can't cop shit up off of me, huh
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
A nigga shot me in the ankle and I ain't kill 'em, ya lucky
Nigga pulled a pistol on me and took my wallet, fuck it
Southside nigga, money long as Godby Road
"Duffle Bag" video was shot in front of Stop-N-Go
Dropped some racks at Avianne and I wore it out the store
Remember Amoco and Optima and riding candy coat
See these niggas tried to played me off the streets, I can feel it
Hundred thousand for a show so every ten shows, that's a milli
Hey, dripping, from the, ceiling, fuck it, look at, nigga, feeling
Told you, last, time, this a, V-12, not a, Hemi
Tity get it, I'ma get it, Tity get it, I'ma get it
Did ya listen? I just did it, I'm exquisite bitch

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
I can't let you niggas trick me off the streets
I can't let you niggas trick me off the streets
I don't wanna sell you nothin', pussy nigga talk is cheap
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets, huh
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets, aye
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets
Boy you might be a cop, you can't cop shit up off of me, huh
Can't let you niggas trick me off the streets, aye
Street, aye, street, aye

[Interlude: Cyhi The Prynce]
"And many false prophets shall rise
And shall deceive many." Matthew 24:11
CyHi, yeah, huh

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
I'm ten toes down, shoes glued to the pavement
Married to the streets, I know the rules of engagement
Moved with the tool and I knew they were hating
Niggas mad I rose out the blue like I'm Jalen
I can easily hit my goon with a payment
Let him do the job, this how I'm used to behaving
They'll probably snitch and say I knew the assailant
They'll trade a cigarette and Mountain Dew for a statement
And I can't do the state pen for none of y'all haters
I ain't in the convo if it don't involve paper
Hard labor, huh, I eat with the partakers
Habitual law breakers, quick with the card capers
We dipped when the cops chased us
Pitchin' the soft got niggas rich as a ball player, medicinal all flavors
To cover up the smell, we shipped it in wall paper, huh
Rip it open with a sharp razor, yeah
My OG turned his young Jedi to Darth Vader
A pound is a acre, they taught us to talk safer
And all my niggas strapped, get smoked like a Gar-Vega
While you chilling with your bitch they'll pull up and broad day-ya
So do me this small favor, and listen to me wisely
When you're out here hustling, make sure you do it quietly
Let your 1911 .45 be your side piece
It's a thousand ways to die so we ridin' with variety
And stay away from blow unless they ask you for sobriety
That white girl will always catch up to you like the Cosby's
Cause they look at 'caine as a menace to society
So Craig, don't let Smokey get you smoked on a Friday
