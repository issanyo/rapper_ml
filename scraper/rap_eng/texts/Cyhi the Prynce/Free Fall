[Intro: [?]]
"You only got two options, winners win and losers lose."
"You uncomfortable yet?"
"Yeah."

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prince]
Base jumpin while the bass bumpin*'
In the back burnin' cookies, Easy-Bake Oven
Got to hurry up 'cause my date rushin'
The funny thing is that she still from Georgia
If you ever pull my card then I'm straight flushin'
Pull up to the club with a Kate Upton
Picked her up in a 745, 30 minutes later, went and ate somethin'
I'm a mack, money long like space button*
Ha, niggas grillin' but that ain't nothin'
Don't let me take your bitch, play somethin'
Let me get the dope without the cash, nigga stay frontin'
Ha, I'm a Zone 6 nigga, chrome kit nigga, four phones, six figures
Go home thick stripper, Ozone, Big Dipper
Mobile home brick shipper, soapstone in the kitchen
Postpone rappers albums when they hear my shit, nigga
Never twist Swishers, Dutch Palma, quick tripper
But they always runnin' out so I hit the Chevron
Text my nigga, GB, get a zip of Exxon
Make-up sex with your girl, pillowcase with Revlon
We was fuckin' on the stairs, damn near had a step-son
So watch your mouth little nigga 'cause

[Chorus: Sy Ari da Kid]
I know some things nobody knows
Can't trap my mind, can't take my soul
Turn up the heat I feel life is so cold
And I can't call it, they keep callin'
Oh yeah, I feel like I'm fallin'
Feels like the whole world is fallin', fallin'

[Verse 2: Translee]
Let me pause for a second
These niggas ain't good here like bacon
You would think all I drink is Dos Equis
Bullshit raps mixed in with the message
That mean I got some karma comin' in with the blessin'
Workin' out, I'm gettin' Gucci Mane fit
Through them hula hoops again, oh that's hooligan shit
Direct deposits everyday, I'm drivin' Uber and Lyft
I got to keep a side hustle, got to do the side, swift
I done linked up with the king, now these bitch want a ring
Ain't it funny, when I rung you ain't answer
Ain't it funny, play dumb when I @ you
I used to DM, you ain't used to see 'em, now ain't it funny
I don't blame you baby you just want the bag
And you don't really care like if a nigga text back
As long as you stuntin' on your nigga from your past
And you know I be always down to help with that
But I know some things nobody knows
When you catch a grip, I let go (let go)
Vision ain't clear, only thing 20/20 be the Mad Dog
This gon' be the year the fake people take the mask off
Thinkin' 'bout my future, still tryna shake my past off
Like I'm [?], Translee

[Verse 3: Sy Ari da Kid]
Aye, I feel like I'm the man right now
I feel like you don't understand right now (oh no)
And the block so hot, I think I can catch a tan right now
I think I need to buy another fan right now
Your enemies lookin' like fam right now
Your favorite rapper sendin' me his mixtape links
But them emails lookin' like spam right now
Yeah free fall, lookin' up my nigga
In the kitchen, cookin' up my nigga
Done with the bullshit, I took enough my nigga
Never let a hoe say I shouldn't trust my nigga
Fuck famous, I'd rather be rich
You'd rather be that, I'd rather be this
And I got the juice, I gradually sip
Some want to be Bishop, I'd rather be bliss
And with all these customers, I'm accustomed
They playin' catch-up, ran out of mustard
And it's a must that I hit the function
With all my wifeys, they think I'm Muslim
Hey, I'm just playin' baby JK (aye)
I'm free fallin' and we ballin', skreets callin'
And we came to finish what we started
And I'm free, Sy Ari, free fallin'
Said I'm free, free fallin'
