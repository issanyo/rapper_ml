[Verse 1]
Girl I like the way you move that waist line
Bounce that ass to the bassline
And I heard through the grapevine
You a freak, you like fucking in the day time
I don't need a iPhone to get some face time
If pussy was a drug, I'mma lace mine
If pimping had a test, I would ace mine
Cooler then my Jordan 11's, the grey kind
I like them girls that like to do it on the first night
Let me murk twice then I'm jumping on the first flight
I gotta pipe cause that ass in that skirt right
So come back to my room and ride me like a dirtbike
Until you get sea-sick
I like your dress but I want what's underneath it
Baby girl I'm getting dough, deep dish
Peep this, tonight

[Hook]
I'm looking for a freak bitch, a freak bitch, a freak bitch
Who ain't scared to come out of them Vicky Secrets, them Secrets, them Secrets
She ain't the type that you going out to eat with, eat with, eat with
So tonight I'm looking for a freak bitch, a freak bitch, a freak...bitch

[Verse 2]
Girl that ass is humongous
Make a nigga wanna throw a few hundreds
Some women may not like cause I'm too honest
But the only folks I'm lying to is congress
Tongue kissing fast now she feeling on my johnson
Told her stop playing, gon' and blow me like a trumpet
She wetter than the lakes of the state of Wisconsin
She know how to make her way south without a compass
She say her legs hurt, feel like she doing lunges
You should wanna fuck me, look what I've accomplished
I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I honked it If you ain't a dime, then you gotta have some donkage
And I ain't got time for a bougie ho
I need a chick who wanna drink this Don Julio
Come to the studio and bring some lingerie
Really what I'm tryna say

[Hook]

[Outro x4]
Bounce that ass ho
