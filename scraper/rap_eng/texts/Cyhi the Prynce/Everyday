[Verse 1: Eroc]
Rise to the top man, yeah
I told mama I make it, so i did
Hustling on the block shit I couldn't even live like that no mo, shit I had to go
Niggas try to kill a nigga, try to get me through that door
But fuck these niggas, that's why I work on these projects
So I can move my mama out the projects
She said son keep on working
And we gonna make it to the top that's for certain
But right now we got bills to pay
She said look in the sky and just pray
I told mama you say that everyday
She said I know I do, well let God lead the way

[Hook: Reuben McCray]
You don't know what I been through to get where I am
All the things i had to do but still here I am
Many nights I didn't think I'd make it home
Out here hustling on my own
And this is my story, yea
( I live it everyday 5x )

[Verse 2: Sir Micheal Rocks]
Now, let me ask you is it still fun as it was
Back when you was first blowing up, yep, that's a rush
You shouldn't rush it when ya itinerary fill up quick
It start to be a lil too much shit and obligation
Interviews, on the phone, at ya gate waiting
Or for the plane that's finna take you on a vacation
Why you was tripping i was in the dungeon
Writing hits and yep the bitches loved it
A unsigned nigga with a budget, a long time coming
Motherfuckers fuck the time better now than any other
So listen up, you missing it, there go ya chance
They got the bright lights on ya hope you know to dance


[Hook: Reuben McCray]
You don't know what I been through to get where I am
All the things i had to do but still here I am
Many nights I didn't think I'd make it home
Out here hustling on my own
And this is my story, yea
( I live it everyday 5x )

[Verse 3: Cyhi the Prynce]
Okay here's my documentary, smoke weed for my serenity
Niggas will rob they partners before they go rob they enemies
I don't write bars or similes I jot my memory
Down on this paper that's the only way that they'll remember me
Mentally paranoid like i'm in the car with Kennedy
I'm schizophrenic B, shoot a nigga accidentally
I fucks with Keisha so don't call my phone and ask for Kimberley
If I ever get caught for what I bought it'll cost a half a century
Of my life span for the white man
Kept a bible and a pistol on the nightstand
Life is just a gamble it depend on how the dice land
I guess I'm nocturnal cuz i'm up every night praying, cuz really

[Hook: Reuben McCray]
