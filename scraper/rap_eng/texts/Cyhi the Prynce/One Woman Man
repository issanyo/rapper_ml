[Verse 1]
Yeah, story of my life
First of all, I turned down more pussy than y’all ever had
Rachet bitches threw it at me but I never smashed
I was fucking strippers now that shit is just a fad
But I knew that running round with them would never last
I even had a Benz, 500, leather black
But she left me for a richer nigga with a better class
Now I’m just out here tryna be a better dad
For my future kids that I’ll probably never have
Cause they mama’s usually tripping bout them bitches you be whit in
When they want to get you back they try to use your children
When did being baby daddy become a new position?
Can’t see my kids growing up without my supervision
My son gone cut the grass, my daughter gone do the dishes
My wife is in the kitchen, I guess I’m just superstitious
So if I married you, I married you
And I promise that I would never embarrass you
And when you fall I got your back like a parachute
Cause you know it’s more to life than just a pair of shoes
You deserve Anna Winter and a Paris shoot
With a baller that let you hoop like Sheryl Swoopes
But until I find that lady I be in this new Mercedes
With a pretty little flower, I guess I’m driving Miss Daisy
And to all the future women that date me
Don’t try to change the principles that made me

[Hook]
This one woman man
I’m the type to put a diamond on your hand
I’m a one woman man
Turn you to a soccer mom, put the kids in the van
Just a one woman man
Honeymoon overseas to Japan
Cause I’m a one woman man
Cause I’m the type to introduce the beach to the sand
I’m a one woman man

[Verse 2]
Yo, if I was locked up on Wright street would you write me?
The feds want to indict me, would you kite me?
Bust your head till the white meat for my wifey
She never fight me bout who like me on IG
But feisty, nightly shawty politely tight me
Can you come over and pipe me?
I might be there in 30 minutes
Sex was so good, the people cross the street heard me in it
Whoever said fairytales don’t have a perfect ending
Not only do divorces hurt the heart, it hurt the business
I just want a chick to help me win like Geno Auriemma
I’m the type to see your car and leave a C note in your window
Turn your closet into Louisville, I’ll be your Rick Pitino
Then knock the pussy out like Deebo playing C-note
At the casino out in Reno
Sipping pino, playing [?]
Thinking bout my future
I’m groomed in all white, and the bride in fuchsia
On the honeymoon doing kinky karma sutra
If I don’t put a beanie on medula
We gon have a little meanie-meanie on the scooter
I just want to keep you near me like a souve
Baby don’t let these niggas fool ya
Congratulations to ya, you just found a

[Hook]
