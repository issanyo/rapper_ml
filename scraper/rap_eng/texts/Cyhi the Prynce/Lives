[Verse 1]
Yeah
CyHi for the rest of our lives
Smoking like a jet in the sky
Fresh to death 'til I die
That's why I'm dressed in a tie
I got a vice Lord like I'm reppin the shy
I love sex and it feel the best when I'm high
Success is nothing but a blessing from God
What's next? I'm all about progression, that's why
They cut checks I'm Creflo collecting my ties
Then I'm back to chiefing with the rest of my tribe
Conquest I rather give a lesson than lie
My music sound like T.I.P. in a session with Nas
I met a girl the other day who was catching my eye
I told her, "All I could see you is dressed as a bride"
She said, "I don't usually mess with a guy that's in the industry
But you got me wet in the thighs"
Girl I'm really a humble nigga,rap is just my disguise
Fuck with me lil mama we'll be rich for the rest of our lives

[Hook]
For the rest of our lives,of our lives
For the rest of our lives
We can't work 9 to 5 for the rest of our lives
For the rest of our lives,of our lives
For the rest of our lives

[Verse 2]
For the rest of our lives
Gotta hustle just to survive
I started with the mere I had to sell em in fives
Then it was kush and purp ,crack I never supplied
All I got was gas money like I'm catching a ride
Smoke a J on all my records like executive CLive
Davis cause I made it for the niggas that drive
Old school Cadillacs, chopping like a battle axe
Smoking something from Seattle bitch I call that Hasselback
Circles of the green I'm out here with them Applejacks
Huh, I'm making flips like an acrobat
Then hit the club and carry on like a travel bag
Celebrating cause I never had to go to Alcatraz
Cause most of my partners prisoners
From narcotics and some projects with them dillingers
My best friend doing 25 really what I'm trying to say
He'll be locked up for the rest of our lives

[Hook]
