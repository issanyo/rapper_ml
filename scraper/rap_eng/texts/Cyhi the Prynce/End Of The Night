[CyHi The Prynce:]
Damn shawty once you put it in reverse
Dre-Dress so short look like it could've been a shirt
I'm fresher than Easter Sunday I should have went to church
So have a little patience, you should of been a nurse
A couple minutes with the Prynce wouldn't hurt
So where you from, who you with and where you work
I'm CyHi you could put it in your search
What I got to do, tuck a rack and put it in your purse?
If you ain't like me then you wouldn't have a smirk
Girl I'm serious you ain't looking at a flirt
I wish I knew you when I was 12 when I lost my virginity (why?)
Cause you should of been my first

[CyHi The Prynce:]
You the princess and I'm the ruler
So let the Bud light cus I'm cool as a cooler
She say she got a guy who abuse her
And he would kill her if she ever let me do her
But it's better to lose a lover than love a loser
She said how I know that you ain't another chooser (ha)
Then she jumped in the car now we back at the crib watcher hang with Mr.Cooper (ha)
Now I'm gripping on her ass, while I'm sipping on a glass
Now I'm in the kitchen with her back, up against the fridge and we listening to jazz then I laughed cause...
