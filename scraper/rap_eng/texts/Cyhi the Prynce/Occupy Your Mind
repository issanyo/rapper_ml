[Hook]
Pick apart
The pieces of your heart
And let me peer inside
Let me in
Where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind
As you do mine

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna give yo siblings some nephews and nieces
Waldorf Astoria, take off Victoria, unveil me a secret
I'm yo romantic mechanic
I specialize in Chevelles and Caprices
I swear this is telekinesis
I just wanna lay inside you like shells on the beaches
It's like I fell in the deepest, part of the ocean
The harder I'm stroking, the louder you yell as I tear you to pieces
You smelling like berries and peaches
It's like we been together forever but I barely know her
But if Jesus had a sister, she'd be Mary's daughter
We barely sober, gone off Hennessy and Cherry Cola
I grabbed her ass and kissed her areola
Her love make me wanna marry her, Sharapova
I'm talking foreplay in Norway, gourmet and sorbet, sex in the doorway
Girl I'm tryna

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Slide under this duvet, while I dive in your souffle
Put our lives in a suitcase, we can fly to the UK
Or go shopping in Cali a few weeks, I'mma travel your vallies and peaks
Body language is, the only way we can actually speak
I can make you smile in your sleep, feel like you ran a mile in the sheets
I'm privileged baby, you make a nigga feel proud to be me
Huh, ice cubes on your torso, laying nude in the floorboard
I went ?? take a shower and bath
Make you scour through the bed for the rest of your wardrobe
I just wanna

[Hook]
