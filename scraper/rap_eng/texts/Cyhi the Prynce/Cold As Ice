[Verse 1: CyHi da Prince]
Fucking with me is like Russian Roulette
I'm cold as Quebec
The way I be rapping sound like that I'm busting two tecs
With a perfect duet
I'm sharp as a razor blade that covers Gillette
I'm under your neck
You think that you're better than Prince then I'll come to your set
That wasn't a threat
I would have dubbed over your tape if it was a cassette
From the west of Gwinnett
I'm one of the dopest rap niggas you ever done met
I'm smoking that Shrek
With a sexy brunette on a jet and she giving me neck
Get plenty of sex
The way I be dressing they calling me vinaigrette
They say I'm too fresh, in fact
A general you just a cadet
So show me respect
Cydel get mail faster than Pony Express
They owe me a check
My only regrets
Is not checking these niggas with phoney baguettes
Claiming they on the block
Juking like Tony Dorsett
But I know that's a lie, man, they can't do what I can
I'm from the Middle East, you ain't ran the streets that I ran
From Paris to Chicago
Atlanta back to Thailand
They yell the same thing every time I finish rhyming
They say...

[Hook: Lou Gramm (Foreigner)]
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love

[Verse 2: CyHi da Prince]
I got hits, I'm Pujols, I'm D1, you juco
Got girls in all sizes, I'm something like a shoe store
More haters than 2-4, y'all softer than new growth
Don't see yo goons for, cause they shoot slow like Kukoč
But I'm on Mars like Bruno, so gone on Pluto
On an old brawn with a new ho
I tell her roll up and she do so
Black chick, her pussy pink like Nuvo
I don’t choose, I get picked like the drummer in The Roots fro
Trend setter with a vendetta
With people fucking up Prince cheddar
Grew up tougher than Benz leather
More stripes than a Twins catcher
It's hard to be a real nigga
When there's niggas who pretend better
But I just keep my eyes on the buck like Jim Tressel
Take your bitch to the crib
Lay back then I'll bench press her
Had the streets in a full nelson
Couldn't tell me I didn't wrestle
Cause I used to sell trees
Dreaming of my own LP
This is what the old G's in Decatur used to tell me
