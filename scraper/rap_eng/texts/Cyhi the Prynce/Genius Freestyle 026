I had to cut the beat off for the nonbelievers
I always knew that I would be the one to lead us, huh
Got a nigga feelin’ like the son of Jesus
Now I’m back like Christ in the month of Easter
Shawty I was in the trap with a ton of Keisha
Serve a nigga seven grams, that’s a hundred meters
And my bitch a Mona Lisa mixed with Condoleezza
I go Jumanji for the honeys, I got jungle fever
Baby I need two women, in my pool swimmin’
Swimsuits missin’, drinkin’ Blue Ribbon
With my crew chillin’, boy we through dealin’
But my Rasta partna still know how to stew chicken, huh
Some of ‘em still got some screws missin’
They’ll put the iron to your head like a beautician
That’s why I don’t beef with niggas unless we Ruth Chrissin’
When I think about it, it’s some things I do different
But I’m on a new mission
When I talk, boy, the youth listen
I’m ODB with the tooth missin’, huh
I was so appalled that they had to put RZA on it
Ye heard my verse and had to put Jigga on it
Shout out to Pusha T, they even had my niggas on it
Had so many punches I went Thrilla in Manila on it
It’s the Roc-A-Fella tree, huh
You can stop the shit, you can acapella me
‘Cause y’all could never drop a better bar that’s clever
Altogether, talk Panera, chop the cheddar, mozzarella cheese
Yeah, got that Scarlet Letter freak on my off-vanilla seats
Nigga please, niggas female rate, niggas DL hate
‘Cause I get ‘em wholesale, they get ‘em retail rate
Hitter parked outside, I let the shooters tailgate
Niggas tried to check me, end up with a stalemate
Hit him with the .38 so he can check the shell case
You see the 12? Nigga, Tony Hawk skate
Yeah, okay I’m comin’ back

I had a dream that I was free at last
I used to be a thief, now I’m Malik Shabazz
All my niggas shooters and they keep a mask
Lick off a shot like a tequila glass
Keep some cash just in case I want a piece of ass
I pay a bitch not to say nothin’
Not because I need some ass
Benz truck, I’m a G with class
Told shawty I’m the type you go and meet your dad
But I can tell she get it from her mother
I get it from the gutter, nights there wasn’t supper
I learned when I was young, niggas gonna suffer
Yeah I’m signed to Sony, but I’m here to warn a brother
Ving Rhames told me it’s all about the guns and butter
Me and my dawgs so close, can’t tell us ‘part from one another
From bein’ scared of the dark, duckin’ under covers
To bein’ scared of the narcs, duckin’ undercovers
Gettin’ bread on the block from all the corner hustlers
I’m in the head of a broad like I’m Bronner Brothers
Land a cat, flowin’ over Primo beats
If I wasn’t rappin’, I’d prolly have that green OG
I’d be sellin’ everything that the young niggas doin’
Pull up like I’m Mr. Clark, I got that lean on me
Lauryn Hill, even though I got that thing on me
And I let it sing like…
Boy you know you better watch out
‘Cause this shit can get hostile
This P96 come from Moscow
Pow-pow, beef is better served Mr. Chow style
