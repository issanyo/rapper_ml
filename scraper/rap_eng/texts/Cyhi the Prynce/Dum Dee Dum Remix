[Verse 1: King Louie]

Chicas call me Bobby, my watch is tsunami
Bands done oragami
Keisha keep me zombie
Breezy with your breezy
Molly got it easy
Give to the needy and still eat like I'm greedy
I get more green than the green did, smoking like a flyer
Say she don't admire, tell her I said she a liar
She a flexing ass liar
She be a thottie with the texting
Try and fuck me through the message every time I send some real shit
On my ad-lib doing message
Ha, The word is funny
Bitch you catch it?
Got your baby mama with me
All she want to do is catch it
She a fetcher, little stretcher
Her head is "Ay we some?"
I'm glad she gave me some
Cranium
A nigga is about that action
"No way we done"
Since Day One, A 1
He's American cop
When I get in my car, don't need a key to start up
I keep it in my pocket, press the break and the button
And here I come
Smoke like it's good for my lungs
Don't got no love for these hoes
I spend them bands on my clothes
I smoke dope
I fuck haters
Some of my best friends is killers
No I don't' know fuck niggas
Need babysitters
I love both of my brothers
I keep it two for the brothers
Me and my niggas is hustlers

[Verse 2: Tree]

Need five-hundred, I see five-hundred
Cool-ass G and the Seattle five-hundred
They lock me out I'm getting bailed by the morning
And yeah I'll be on it, yeah I'll be on it
Looking for a victim to pin a tail on a donkey
I'm trying leave shit-faced paired with a woman
I'm looking for a super head to head gold diamond
Call me form the fed run set don't love'em
Sneak out in the morning and fresh down all of your rubbers
Well nine months later you got three or four baby mamas
Lord knows Tree's been hot so long
Pop it like G string
Shorty drop in that thong
All up in this bitch like limes in Coronas
Bigger cojones
Tina Antonia
Party in the city but they came from Apollonia
I don't wanna own you I just wanna loan you
Take you for the night and do you right like in the wrongest
Blowing on the strongest, blacker than my lung is
Ask about my sins
They'll tell you that I run this
Yeah you ain't gotta stop me
Just stop me where the drum is
All the brothers pop me
Hit me harder than a drum key
That's when you the youngest
I'm just being honest
Now I've smartened up and got a bitch who go the dumbest
Put me where the phone is
Show me where the rum is
Said she need a stiff drink
Put it where her tongue is

[Verse 3: CyHi the Prynce]

Ran into this beauty in the Maxima with a gluttious maximus that is truly spectacular
While my jewelry distracted her
Crept up smoothly from back of her
Come in cool like a bachelor
Cause I ain't like them other niggas that's usually harassing her
But if she drop it down and back it up
She'll probably cause a massacre
Moral of the story is
Shorty got an ass on her
And the dumpy bouncing like the drum key
Shorty got so much junk in her trunky
So little mama let that thing drop
Take that top off
Quit acting like you ain't hot
Shorty must be from Thailand
Cause when I took her to my spot all she want to do was Bangkok
Threw a hundred ones
Let the rain drop
She changed her mind now I'm somewhere getting brain washed
And that's all she got
Do I look like a lame boy?
I know she a ho, bro
You really think I'm really that...
