[Verse 1: Cyhi Da Prince]
One hand wash the other, both hands wash the face
That was food for thought, nigga go wash yo plate
My kingdom is The Firm, and pimp I'm Dr. Dre
Good Music is the team and shawty I'm Dr. J
Cause real niggas do real things, we don't talk we don't spill beans
Start selling mid when I was 15, Hidden Hills off Field Green
Got a stupid chain, gotta ill ring, Jacob nigga that's real bling
I'm a drum major I keep a band and a buncha hoes on my drill team
Young prince I know real kings, I dont sleep but I still dream
Born and raised in the dirty south, but when you see me I'm still clean
Shawty I'm a legend in the A, Dominique Wilkins
I gotta question to ask yall, any real players in the building?

[Hook]
I'm in the club, throwed like lacrosse
Chillin in my section, smoking that exhaust
Yo bitch was on my dick and shawty that ain't my fault
So before you start some shit, I suggest you walk
Real talk, real talk, real talk, r-real talk
Real talk, real talk, real talk, r-real talk
Real talk, jealousy, that's against the law
Real talk, r-real talk, r-real talk, r-real talk
R-real talk

[Verse 2: Cyhi Da Prince]
I said man sharpen man, like steel sharpen steel
I'm the streets' Dr. Phil, I make music y'all can feel
Yeen talking 'bout no money if you ain't talking mills
Took my fives to the bank and exchanged for larger bills
Boy I keep a lot of hoes, you can ask my partner Pill
If Tameka ain't gon' fuck, then I know that Tasha will
You went and bought that bitch a truck, from me she barely got a meal
You look like one of them rap niggas who never got a deal
But I'm a B-O-S-S, jumping out of that S.S
High school, superlatives, she most attractive, I'm best dressed
I'm so happy to be alive but every day I'm dead fresh
She already on my dick and we ain't even had sex yet
I got the discount, you paid the retail rate
Don't be jealous mufucka that's a female's trait
She let the whole gang bang, we call her East LA
Cuz I'm a V-12 and nigga you just a CLK

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dose]
Make big plays, bang desert eagles, got desert storm swang from my charm
Ben Franklin tatted in my arm, my nigga eating No Ramadan
Big dough, no Papa Johns, all this damn Versace on
Medusa head, tryna duck the feds, I pop the meds, I pour the meds
I stay low, I keep the mid going for the high I'm bussing heads
We in the building, we do it big, I'm in the bed with yo bitch
And you know this, a hundred bottles help you notice
These diamonds flawless, ferocious - so sick
B-Bitch I'm in my zone, bitch I'm on it
Knock it out the park, bases loaded
My name hold weight nigga watch me tote it
Niggas looking like they want it but that fuck shit they stay on it
I'm in the penthouse, thumbing through thousands, my bitch bad, her ass fat
I get racks, she can have that, 5th Plaza, we smashed that
New coupe, paper tag that, all that money, where ya swag at?
You see me, I burn the track to the 3rd degree and you can wrap that

[Hook]
