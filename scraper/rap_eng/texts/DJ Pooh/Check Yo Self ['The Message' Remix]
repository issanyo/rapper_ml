[Intro: Das EFX]
Yeah
So come on and chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Check

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
You better check yo self before you wreck yo self
'Cause I'm bad for your health I come real stealth
Droppin' bombs on ya moms kill car alarms
Doin' foul crime, I'm that brother wit' the Alpine
Sold it for a six-o, always let tricks know
And friends know, we got the indo
No I'm not a sucka, sittin' in a house of pain
And no I'm not the butler, I'll cut ya
Head butt ya, you say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya, punk you a sucka
Here to let you know boy, oh boy
I make dough but don't call me Dough Boy
This ain't no kinda motion picture
A guy or trick- a, my homie get wit'cha
And hit ya, takin' that yack to the neck
So you better run a check

[Hook: Das EFX]
So come on and chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Yeah, come on and check yo self before you wreck yo self
'Cause shotgun bullets are bad for your health
Chickey-check
Chickey-check

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Tricks wanna step to Cube and then they get played
'Cause they trick-made pullin' out a switchblade
That's kinda trifle, 'cause that's a knife-o
AK-47, Assault Rifle
Hold the fifty, I'm nifty, pow
Gotta new style (watch out now)
I hate real tricks, claimin' that they foldin' bank
But steady talkin' always in the holding tank
First you wanna step to me
Now your ass screamin' for the deputy
They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row
Now they runnin' up in ya slow
You're gone, used to be the Don Juan
Now your name is just Twan
Switch it, snap it, rollin' your eyes and neck
You better run a check

[Hook: Das EFX]
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
'Cause big bees in yo mouth is bad for yo health
Chickey-check (punk)
Chickey-check

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
If you're foul, you better run a make on that license plate
You coulda had a V8
Instead of a tre-eight slug to ya cranium
I got six and I'm aimin' 'em
Will I buss or keep you guessin'
And kill you when that noise ya stressin'
Trick, get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighborhood rat
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Givin' up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop the coochie and ya dead
The trick is a Miami Hurricane hit
Sprung, people call her 'Lips and Lungs'
Nappy dugout, and you stuck out
'Cause women like you gets no respect
Trick, you better run a check

[Hook: Das EFX (Ice Cube)]
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self
'Cause tricks like you is bad for my health
Chickey check
(pump yo brakes)
Chickey check
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self
