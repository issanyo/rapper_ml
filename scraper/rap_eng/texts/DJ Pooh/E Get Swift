Get Swift

(Everybody's dancin)
Get swift
(Quiet on the set)
DJ Pooh's in the house
But yo, this is for my deejay
Alright, check this out

[ King Tee ]
This is for you little weak deejays
The weak record spinner, the weak P.A
Whoever's in charge of the turntable equipment
You haven't heard cuts until you heard the ones Swift gets
Yes, when I rhyme he keeps the break flowin steadily
Never off-beat so suckers can't get ahead of me
Your deejay's had it, we're terminatin his membership
E's back, now come again with some different shit
You wanna learn about cuttin and scratchin and mixin
He'll be fixin to show you some good tricks and
A new style shown to those that's worthy
Lord have mercy, he's number uno, first, E
Swift we call him Swift because he's swift on the cut and scratch
No one can match or catch, then stand back
For those who wanna see him, I give you a good tip
Have a seat and watch E get swift

( *E-Swift scratches* )
Watch him
(Are you ready)
Watch
Yeah
Watch E get Swift
(Are you ready)
(Ready) (ready) (ready)
(Hey, listen to the man)

[ King Tee ]
Now what you just saw is probably funky to you
You and your crew (but what about them girls?) them too
Who wants to step up, some never kept up
They wanna flex up, so E-Swift wrecks up
Shop, hops, so how could you diss E?
You need to play like Janet and just miss me
With that conversation, that blah-blah-sation
E, bust a rap while I go on vacation

[ E-Swift ]
E-Swift, the golden deejay with the knack to make a track
To make you dance till your back snap
Pooh on the drum, the cuts - mine
K-i-n-g Tee writes the rhyme
So wack deejays who run off at the lip
The ones who talk shit while your records skip
In a battle (battle him) ( *record skips* ) you need mo' practice
My cuts are more sharper than the needles on a cactus

[ King Tee ]
Yo, that was dope, E-Swift
Check this out
But you got some dope scratches and cuts
Yo, yo, yo
Bust it

( *E-Swift cuts up* )
(Turn it out)
(DJ)
(Turn it out)
(Listen up)
(Mr. Deejay)
(Listen up)
(Hey, listen to the man)
(He is the master of a scratch)
(Huh-huh)
(He is the master of a scratch and cut)
(Huh-huh)
