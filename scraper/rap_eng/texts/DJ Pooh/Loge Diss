[Intro]
Hey, it's Logan
Leave a message

[Verse 1: C-Hinch]
Commish on the track and my nuts are still big
'Bout to smoke Loge like a freshly lit cig
My pipe is hard an my sheets are stained
Both cause Kenz just threw me some brain
Mera, Holley, Allie, Loge's prime victims
Not a care for their hearts, just wanted to dick 'em
He may have finger banged and sucked their titties
But none of these girls is a match for Chassidy
Loge's first crush, he loved her from the start
Went to HOCO in 6th grade and stole his heart
Now he claims they're done but Imma call his bluff
3 months from now he'll be wanting Chass' muff
Enough about girls, I'm through with that
Now I'd like to take you on a little flashback
9th grade football, he dives on the play
But the runner broke the tackle and Loge broke Tre
There was fainting in the stands and crying on the field
All Loge could do was sit and take a kneel
But that's been forgotten, at least that's how it seems
And now Loge's whiffs are strictly kickoff team
I'm going in now so don't even try and stop me
My flow is as smooth as Jane Ann's sloppy toppy
Loge's hair is nasty, don't care what you say
This Sunday we gon' cut it, it's gonna be a good day
Dissing him hard in just about every way
Just remember, I banged your mom Logan Clay

[Verse 2: T-Dix]
It's your vice commish and it's my turn on this diss
All up in this rap like I was with Loge's sis
There is no doubt that Imma kill this
Jane Ann just gave me that good luck kiss
It's time to stop bragging and start dissing Clay
He gets with lots of girls but it goes one-way
Sucked a lot of titties and that's okay
But the only girl to touch his dick is Lacie Jade
Now that's enough about the girls
Let's move on to the hair
His brown, curly locks, they need intensive care
And just in case none of you are aware
He sent K-Shirk a picture in his underwear
Loge claims he pulls but he won't fool me
All his girls are easy, example: Jaycee
Females be aware when you listen to this song
Logan really likes stringing you along
He claims to want a girlfriend but he won't move on
He'll kiss you and he'll diss you like he did with Mo Vaughn
Mackenzie calls me daddy, when I bang her
Logan, I'm your father, call me Darth Vader

[Verse 3: Pleasure P]
It's the Logan diss and it's time to get busy
When I think about all the girls you try to get with I get dizzy
I don't know how many times that I'll have to listen
The story with the thumb circles in class with Ms. Christian
Pussy, you claim to get much
Holla at me if a girl ever gives your dick a touch
Loge's a good guy, he never smokes cigs
But seriously Loge, stop sending jackoff vids
Loge will hit you up with some masturbation tips
All you gotta do is log on to Damp Lips
You always claim you get girls on the reg
Too bad you got a stiffy when Erika licked your leg
You're taking Creatine, coach said you had potential
You love Lakin Wellman but all you can do is throw pencils
You're last in the league, and Jaycee's a tramp
Get your haircut and bow down to the champ

[Outro]
