[Chorus]
Real nigga count hundreds, a thug nigga's model
Spending drug money like I hit the Georgia lotto
We're getting money, we're getting money
We're getting money, we're getting money

[Verse 1]
You wanna fly? Nigga, hang on me
I've been doing this shit since the mid-nineties
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
But I ain't been changed, man, ain't that something?
Trap still bunking, [?] still coming
Small face hundreds in '94 money
Big face hundreds, I've been getting money
Still got bananas if you niggas acting monkey
Fuck it, it's in the air
K I N G [?]
The last time I checked, I'm the man on the street
They know I'm Lo, I'm CEO

[Chorus]
Real nigga count hundreds, a thug nigga's model
Spending drug money like I hit the Georgia lotto
We're getting money, we're getting money
We're getting money, we're getting money

[Verse 2]
Twinkle twinkle, I'm a stizz-ar
Beat the [?] at the [?]
Candy pizz-ain't, more than running
Valet still cost a hundred
It still don't matter, still getting money
Small time nigga, still getting fronted
[?] off the Honda, dispatch monkeys
Shoot the double hundreds, Coupe 'bout a hundred
Units in the city, get about a hundred
[?] yayo, plenty money coming

[Chorus]
Real nigga count hundreds, a thug nigga's model
Spending drug money like I hit the Georgia lotto
We're getting money, we're getting money
We're getting money, we're getting money
Real nigga count hundreds, a thug nigga's model
Spending drug money like I hit the Georgia lotto
We're getting money, we're getting money
We're getting money, we're getting money
