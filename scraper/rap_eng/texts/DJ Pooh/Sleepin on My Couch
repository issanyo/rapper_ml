[Hook]
Get your lazy butt up off my couch
Get your lazy butt up off
Get your lazy butt up off
Get your lazy butt up off my couch

[Verse 1]
It seems nowadays friends step to me bogus
And end up on my couch at night without notice
It's cool to have a friend over every now and then but I gotta have my space
And I don't wanna see their face
Like every single day of the week, talk is cheap
You betta find yourself another place to sleep
It ain't my fault that ya moms got fed up
And now you wanna come to my crib and wet my bed up
You better find a job so you can get an apartment
And you can save your crocodile tears don't even start with
The sob stories. I got enough from the other seven brothas in the den playin' Genesis
Damn I can't win at this
Seems like I'm gonna have to flip
And tell those other brothas that they're gonna have to skip
I've had it up to here with these lazy cats
They keep sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
People come to my house and kinda wonder where the squadron's at
They're not gone, they're just down at the laundrymat
Because they wear the same pairs of clothing
I'm taking up crazy patience just holding
My temper
I'm about to start charging rent for
Every single brother that kicked it with my mother eating biscuits on Saturday morning like a family
The minute they step it's like moms is crazy mad at me
Cause they're in my mother's room watching television
I feel like giving 'em the boot and say the hell with 'em
But if I give 'em the boot I'm not a friend though
Even though my room smells like dime bags of indo
But I can't pretend like I haven't been peepin' it
Even mom knows that my brothas been sleepin' on
My couch for weeks. So your speeches fall flat
They keep sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Maybe this was just my upbringing perhaps
But I was taught that I shouldn't take seven day naps
At other brothas' cribs like I don't have a home
Brothas on my couch so much there's like foam
Coming out the seams and a pair of jeans
Is missing from my closet, I wonder why I even bother being friendly
They're running my ass like the Indy 5000
They went and wrinkled my mother's blouse
When they snuck downstairs for a midnight snack
And ate the last slice of bread and a box of apple jacks
Then they hit the sack with the stereo blastin'
And even little Tyson is fed up, so I'm askin'
You all to jet, before I get upset
And throw each and every one of you bums out on your back
My house is a mess, so step ya little pest
Who was sleepin' on my couch cause I'm tired of that
