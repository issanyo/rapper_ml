Fever in the pulse, cause it's a must when I bust
And of course when I bust, you know I gots you [?]
Ain't nobody tryin' to look pretty, I gets busy
You don't really hear me, pump it up, y'all
Shy girls don't last too long
Singin' the same old song, cause baby life goes on
Mama said there'd be days like this, listen up, do the right stuff
Keep your panties up, life is rough
And ain't nobody [?]
Brothers don't get souped up, cause [?] got you goin'
Got the feelin', I'm ready to funk, so let's rip it
The IBWC get with it, how many times must I say it to make 'em understand?
Havin' a baby won't keep a man
It's kinda sad, to see our sisters lost
But if you wanna play the game you gotta pay the cost
I can see through it, tell the truth it's a shame
For who's it teaching you and where to point the blame
And see before they learn they all get jerked
And the system's caught up so that they never have to work
Yo, it could've been the middle of society
Is what bothers me
So I don't take the role of the preacher, I'll preach to each
And I'll teach 'em how to teach
Our generation's gone under. Why watch 'em suffer
And take the road of a lover?
I guess they like to see us barefoot and pregnant
Waitin' every month we get a check and
Livin' off the rich, stop the people who's tryin' to do it
Make the schools teach ya this so write ya to it
Well I got some new stuff for you, listen up
Don't sleep with no men that you can't trust
And don't be fooled by these fellas, they play you if you let 'em
Keep 'em steppin' have to check 'em when he's in the [?]

[Chorus]
Shouldn't be no fool you should have listened
And now you're running back to us because he's missin'

The same sucker see him every day dressed the usual way
He's out to [?] ladies
Got his line made up, and his goal already set
Wants to make a couple of G's, we gon' step back
Goin' round, always round, almost down for the count
Damn, ran a little short, so bam pull a metal pan
Got his own clients, even though [?]
See you gotta meet Sally, cause Sally is the [?]
Every other hour Sally's got a [?] or two
She's tryin' to tell the corner man to give the [?] to her
He told her "I can fix you up real good
Just bring some friends from your hood"
He said "The more you bring the more you get" so bam it was on
Every thirty minutes, Sally's gettin' her [?] on
Damn, all you gotta do is tell a friend
You better believe now Sally took in
Now every day was the usual, [?] she choke
Corner man was fat, plus two men supplied the dope
The neighborhood was nothin' for me [?] had their money
The kids acting funny cause the crack can [?]
The food on the table, the shoes on their feet
Barely got a place to sleep but that's deep
Kid's got a bed, for [?]
[?] may be young but [?]

[Chorus]
