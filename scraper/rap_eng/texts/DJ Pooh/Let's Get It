[Intro: Shawty Lo]
D4L in the building, Braski (40 Cal)
Propa Boi Committee, Redboi, what's happening? (SIE)
Choppa Fam, Pimp Game, let's get it (MDC)
Born Immac, DJ Pooh on the beat (Shop Boyz)

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
Dope boys got them girls going wild
Well, goddamn, I done found my style
I done found my swag
You can nip it in the bud and you can put it in the bag
Dope boys, let's get, get, get it
Let's get, get, get it
Let's get, get, get it
Rep where you from if you get, get, get it
Dope boys got them girls going wild
Well, goddamn, I done found my style
I done found my swag
You can nip it in the bud and you can put it in the bag

[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
It was a typical morning, I'm yawning 'cause I'm horny
Off in Magic City, star-studded on a Monday
Valet cost a hundred
It don't really matter cause I'm getting to the money
I'm the man now, who want it?
Y'all makind it rain, but the kid got it storming
Well goddamn, Lo, give it to them
A hundred thousand in that bitch, I'm finna do it, do it
I'm a freak, I like to see the girls do it
I still got them for the L-O
17-5, all you gotta do it holl-O
Remember, '96 burnt orange Monte Carlo

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
Dope boys got them girls going wild
Well, goddamn, I done found my style
I done found my swag
You can nip it in the bud and you can put it in the bag
Dope boys, let's get, get, get it
Let's get, get, get it
Let's get, get, get it
Rep where you from if you get, get, get it
Dope boys got them girls going wild
Well, goddamn, I done found my style
I done found my swag
You can nip it in the bud and you can put it in the bag

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
K-I-N-G, S-N-A-P
Nope, bet you can't do it like me
Yep, y'all some wannabes
You pussy niggas better get your weight up
I push weight and I ain't never did a pushup
Only thing I did was lift a fork and did the cookup
Learned the recipe, had the city in trouble
I already had muscle
Now I'm sitting back and I'm watching money double
It's no secret, I'm on the rise
I crossed the game over like Allen I
Why work a 9-to-5?
Fuck with your boy, get a 9 for 5

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
Dope boys got them girls going wild
Well, goddamn, I done found my style
I done found my swag
You can nip it in the bud and you can put it in the bag

[Verse 3: D.G. Yola]
I know you know who I be
D-A G-R-E-A-T
Got the streets on click clack, I lock them down
Them hoes going crazy every time I'm in town
I'm the hottest thing smoking, the motherfucking truth
And I ain't playing, I make it do what it do
When I'm in the spot, they know when I'm in the building
'Cause me and my niggas throwing money to the ceiling
I'm chilling, grilling these hoes when I smile
'Cause dope boys got these girls going wild
Stacks on deck, fuck what a hater think
We young niggas and gotta keep a big bank

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
Dope boys got them girls going wild
Well, goddamn, I done found my style
I done found my swag
You can nip it in the bud and you can put it in the bag
Dope boys, let's get, get, get it
Let's get, get, get it
Let's get, get, get it
Rep where you from if you get, get, get it
Dope boys got them girls going wild
Well, goddamn, I done found my style
I done found my swag
You can nip it in the bud and you can put it in the bag
