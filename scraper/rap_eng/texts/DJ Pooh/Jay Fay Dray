He-he-he-he yeah
It was a real cool day, you know?
All the pimps came out to play
King Tee was the spokesman and guess what he had to say..

Hm-hm
Yo, my name is King Tee and I like to say hey
Love catchin stunts cause the King ain't gay
Rock the mic like Al B! Sure, you know 'night & day'
For you sucker chump rappers: step off, make way
Hey, I once knew a girl by the name of Fay
Her titties was bigger than the Frisco Bay
One night I got her drunk with a little Tanqueray
Then I asked her for some head and Fay said 'okay!'
I knew a brother, big dope dealin Jay
He liked to sell crack to the basehead Dray
One day Dray got amped and jacked Jay for his pay
So Jay came and found Dray and shot him dead with an A.K
And I say with my rhymes I slay
I serve sucker MC's on a silver tray
If you got a bad cake use a little ????
And if your underarm stinks use deodorant sprayyyyyy
Baby, yeah, it's like that, it's like that, y'all
It's like this, y'all
I don't rap long, still make a hit, y'all
