[King Tee]
Yes yes y'all, it's not a secret no more
The King b-boy Tee has been washed ashore
And I'm back I'm here to say if I'm a King then I should rule
I'm the best for the job, you know why?
(WHY?!) Cause I'm cool..

.. see I'm
Smoother than silk, cooler than an icicle
Rough like a bully, I'm rollin like a bicycle
Fresh like a virgn calculates like a math wiz
You think you're bad? I'mma show you what bad is
Microphone magician, it's the end when I start
A confidential differential, I'm the state of the art
Crowned King b-boy, the elite rap reverand
Master of the Ceremony twenty-four/seven
MC's don't fear me, I come in peace, ha
Drapped in Fila, or either Elise
Cause I'm the cool wop dancer, girlies romancer
Suckers stay away I'll mess you up like cancer
My style is original, not a subliminal
You say to yourself there's no one better, than him you know
Bustin all bustaz, killin all killers
Tacklin MC's like a Pittsburgh Steeler
I'm bolder than bold, I wear a lot of white gold
The supreme King Tee, I've got things in control
Skeezers wanna clock me while I'm on my way to school
You don't, have to ask why, you know the reason..
.. he's COOL!

I got a white gold crown, white gold ropes
Sleep on white sheets, ski on white slopes
Supreme to be exact you know I'm cooler than most
When God gave out coolness, I took a whole dose
I won't bother or nag you, to rhyme I'll be glad to
You thought I couldn't get you but I already had you
I know you heard my DJ, is he good or what?
Keith Cooley is a killer, your DJ's a mutt
I wouldn't try to take him on he'll cut you up like a biologist
He'll be the tutor, and I'm the talk-ologist
You think he's new, well for you I feel sorry
Cause see, he's been around since Uncle Jam's Army
Cool impresario, majority ruler
I got a lot of money - go ask my jewler
Def in the flesh is the cool King Tela
I talk more noise than J&D's talk Fila
I'm the most coolest and I sit on the throne
Givin the latest fashions silver shines like chrome
The King your royal highness better known as a cool rider
Got a forty of Olde E then I'll ask, let me try this
Coolest of cool and my rhymes are essential
To see me, guardians have to be parental
Me and Keith, are the teachers of the new cool school
But not only that, I gotta tell you somethin.. I'm cool!

Keith Cooley!

I can't rhyme about crack, I'm not the one to be tellin it
The ones sayin don't are the ones that's sellin it
I can't cope in other words I can't feel it
If crack was a monster, then I'd kill it
Cause I'm rough and I'm tough, and I come from L.A
Yo my name is King Tee and I'm here to stay
I got the courage of a bull, words of a wizard
Hotter than sex, cooler than a blizzard
Leader of the land, commander and the chief
Bigger and bolder other words I got beef
I got a posse at that, mostly, cold chillin
Yours make thousands, mines make millions
Not at all a gangsta cause I never do crimin
I make a lot of money, by just cool rhymin
Not doin it cause I want to but I'm doin it cause I hasta
Coolest of the cool and plus I rule the rap classes
Yeah my stuff is funky, and I'm the rap junkie
Slammin sucka punks like a Hurricane Bundy
And for the rap race place your bet on the King
I run like Quicksilver, fly like I had wings
To you it seems like that I'm braggin a lot
But I'm saggin a lot, because money I got
I'm the MC dismantler, lyrical manipulator
Eightball drinker, the new cool innovator
I'm King Tee, Keith Cooley is the DJ
No fakin or frontin, turntables do what he say
Cuttin like a ginsu, makin bets against you
The girlies go wild, Keith prove that he can dance to
Fila we wear, won't promise or swear
Don't get too much comp cause MC's I tear
In half, and laugh, cause it's just so hilarious
To walk in a jam, and see the most scariest
Punks in my way, tryin to see how I play
I know they eat more rhymes than horses eat hay
But I keep my cool cause see like, that's my image
Stroll like a gangsta think you lost when I finish
Grab me a skeezer, head towards the booth
Cause I'm not only a King, I'm supreme.. and I'm cool!
