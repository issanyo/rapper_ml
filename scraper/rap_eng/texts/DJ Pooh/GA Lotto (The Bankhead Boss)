[Verse]
You wanna fly? Nigga, hang on me
I've been doing this shit since the mid-nineties
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
But I ain't been changed, man, ain't that something?
Trap still bunking, [?] still coming
Small face hundreds in '94 money
Big face hundreds, I've been getting money
Still got bananas if you niggas acting monkey
Fuck it, it's in the air
K I N G [?]
The last time I checked, I'm the man on the street
They know I'm Lo, I'm CEO

[Hook]
Real nigga count hundreds, a thug nigga's model
Spending drug money like I hit the Georgia lotto
We're getting money, we're getting money...
