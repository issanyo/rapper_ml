[ VERSE 1: Breeze ]
I'm goin through phases, wonderin what is expected of me
For the money or the girls to love me
For the juice, the clout or recognition
Nah, that's already an old tradition
Sometimes I think to myself and say why me
Waitin for a fool to step up and try me
Ain't as easy as it seems, looks are deceivin
You're steppin up and shuttin up, quick in believin
Not on a ego trip, just a phase I'm goin through
Which I like to express and share by showin a few
People just how bad it can get
You thought I couldn't get get with
But I came out to rip shit
You say that I'm soft because I'm hangin out west now
You suckers are silent because I'm showin the best how
You're sort of confused, you're lost, trapped inside a maze
Say that I'm trippin, nah, I'm just goin through a phase

[ VERSE 2: Breeze ]
Let me explain a phase for you in detail
It's adaptin or interactin to the rappin
Like a maze that I'm trapped inside in
Would I waste my fate? Well, rap is decidin
A lot of MC's seem to get weak
Times are changin, boy, change your technique
Whoever try to challenge the kid, I just mold em
Unlock the jock and stop ridin on my scrotum
To the point we have to get back to the
Topic, I'm more a Legend than a Acura
Servin up rhymes with a spatula
And biters, I choose to call em Dracula
Dispite all the conflict rap acts come with
You're addin and addin and it sums up to a drum riff
I don't rob or steal, I do whatever it pays
Rehearse a rhyme, then on to the next phase

[ VERSE 3: Breeze ]
If a MC on the mic is weak, stop the fella
Rock acapella so I can tell a
Sucker that I can get hotter than hell goes
You're tryin to flex, didn't know a chicken had elbows
Many phases and stages to my attitude
Act friendly to a foe and turn around and slap the dude
You mention doom from my rhymes you consume
I'm knockin you out like I was a volume
Tryin to act as if I was a friend of yours
I'm goin through a phase, you're goin through menopause
First you're Moe, then you're Kane, tomorrow you're RA...
You sound kinda funny, money (haha)
Rap is a gift and I refuse to lose it
Without a doubt it's somethin 'bout the music
You're sort of confused, you're lost, trapped inside a maze
Say that I'm buggin, nah, I'm just goin through a phase
