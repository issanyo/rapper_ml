[Hook]
No escape, can't get away
Dumpin' with them funky rhymes
(Pull it out, niggas run like snot)
Nowhere 2 hide

[Verse 1: Threat]
I deliver to you the new blueprints
Vocal instruments phat like them Goodyear blimps
We pimps, beats, put 'em on the streets
Twenty-four hours, seven days a week
I kick science, but they still haven't learned
Step beyond the point of no return and get wet
The rhythmic, hypnotic ear narcotics
Strictly for fanatics and the gangbang addicts
Around the globe, follow ya nose
Down with the underground from my head to my toes
Ride the groove like a three-day cruise
Peace to the East but the West Coast rules
The chocolate child unleashed out the wild
Break the Richter scale and make the party shake tails
Baddest on the atlas just tryin' to stay down
You gotta get up or get off or get clowned

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I came across a close shave runnin' with them renegades
All on display on KTLA
I hate to do it but I'm stupid, don't test me
Unless you wanna get your new clothes all messy
We fed 'em beats but they still insist to spit words
But they can't fuck with this, they get served
Graduated old school G degree
Calm down the savage in any MC
North, south, east, west
By simply hittin' 'em with the melody I possess
So raise your hands up high and get all the way wit’ it
It's the joint, bodies get the munches when they hit it
Like that? Yep, bigger, fatter than the piece
Inflation went up and made the killin' increase
So long for the plan you was plottin'
‘Cause it's long and forgotten once your style turned rotten

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's the mad maestro and it ain't no other
Turn milk into honey and make bread off butter
I hold the title in the middle of my palm
For makin' freaks dance on the floor ‘til dawn
Make way, let me show you how it's done
It's a party and the player hatin' niggas can't come
Got rhymes on my pad and they all hit rocks
Don't sleep ‘cause the sheep just might be a fox
On a hunt, hot on the trail
Hoe givin' up the draws ‘cause her nigga in jail
On the bottom of the ocean to the top of the hill
MCs can't deal with my hi-tech skills
They tight tight, last all night
Buckle up for safety and prepare to take flight
Destination on to the next plateau
It's the Zuu in the house you can't funk with the flow

[Hook]
