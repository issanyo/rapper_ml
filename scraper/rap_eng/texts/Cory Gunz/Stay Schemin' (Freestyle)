Ah, Been So Wrong It Ain't Gone Get No Righter
Diddy Try To Get At Me Like He Did Nick And Tyga
Had The Chips When I Perform I Fuck That Bidness Night Up
I'm Hungry For The Money I Ain't Send A Rider
Back To Business Had These Bitches Who Roll Over On Me
Niggas Mixing Their Priorities With Broke Or Horny
I'm From Where Victims Catch It Promptly Cause They Slow Or Corny
Ain't Nobody Wanna Roll And Now They Smoke It For Me
Get It Twisted If You Wanna I'm a Die The Gunner
When It's For The Company I Skip My Model Numbers
You Niggas Hustling Trying To Do Some Bottle Numbers
Somehow Your Senses 'Bout As Low As Your Survival Numbers
Catch Me Riding Through T.dot With Dreezy Shout To Kneeks
And Noah, Cole, Michael Marley, G.T, Agg And Fee
If You Niggas Still Ain't Get The Picture Soak The Photo
Tot A 4.0 On My Polo
Why? YOLO
Young Money, Militia, CMB Is The Tree
Everybody Branch But Won't Nobody Leave
Mystique!
That's Why I'm The Nigga Nobody Sees
The Rest Of These Niggas Got Expirations For I.D's
I'll Be By Myself Papa Said "get Em Playa"
Now Find Em Twisted In Your City
With Jimmy The Mayor He Said "don't Worry Scrap"
Every Dog Got They Day Now I Couldn't Tell You How Much We Saw In A Day Heh...
