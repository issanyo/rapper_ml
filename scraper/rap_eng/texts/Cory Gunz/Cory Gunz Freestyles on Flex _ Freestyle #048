[Verse]
Ready for combat
Detonate soon as they locate where the bomb's at
Clips long as legs, they don't know where your arms at
Niggas want to smoke until they catch you contact
Try to son a kid and you won't find where your mom's at
Bitch I'm the ripper, fuck around, get your car jacked
Prolly find 'em parked where it ain't no garage at
Close range, trinity, they never dodge that
Never gave a fuck about your crew, lay your squad flat
Only talk to few, put your chin up I nod back
Duckin from the blues 'cause they tint up the dodge black
Find me on a cruise somewhere sittin where the lodge at
You know the rules I bend, grimy ones move in sin
Moves extend with tommy guns, tools to spend
Use the pins, bed pans scattered around
Rather have a cap in your gown
Or splatter to ground
On your black flatten and drown
From the matic or pound
Ain't even gotta initiate the static with sound
Practicing acrobatics with clowns
Abra Kadabra
The Mac inaccurate
The bastards at bat get around
Laugh at it now and you cry when you die
Imma do my
Thing singing outta two rides
Lotta do dah
Heat steaming hot as Dubai
Lotta hooblah
He screaming how could you why
I don't reply
Pussies thinking y'all got new lives
Well I got 2 nines and use one two kill em two times
To run my coupons
Niggas thinking shit is poop-on
Till they get poop-on
Pull up in a group of Yukons
Then nigga you gone
Ain't shit that you goned
Come do my one-two
Too calm
Its one (Pew) you bomb
Trill dancing with Nina Johnny and Peggy right in a leggy
Probably pocket leave you Betti spaghetti
Set if you ready
Cold block hot as a stove top
Im from where the cookouts get turnt into roadblocks
Unload shots
Aim at his face with a nose dot
Im from where they leave your body fresh
And your clothes hot
Motherfucking...
Robbing niggas for pounds
They rob kids for stacks
They grow up lay em down
Im from the way it sound
Get out don't stand downs
No rules on my team
No doubt playing foul
Not with the games
Bounce
You bout to get flamed down
And jumped like Blade Brown
And covered like James Brown
Don't against grains
I pour up
Get brains
Then Roll up
Spliff Stains
Then hold up Lyft Change
Then owe up
Flip change
The roll up on Biscayne
All of you dicks shook, I call em piss stains
Welcome to the Terra dome
The danger zone
Can't a stranger roam
Bang im blown
You set in stone
Leave my name alone
I live like I'm dead already
I Think like I'm shot in the head already
For me is what y'all niggas never ready
Double grip on the eagle make sure the deserts steady
Im not just ED nigga im EDD & EDDY
Im a vet you probably said the shit I said already
For talking beef when you was petting you was never ready
Before you beef with me its best to go to bed with Freddy
You tryna gamble with life until you get a deady
You know the shortie hold the 40 if the chick is with him
These niggas snaking they be shaking when they hit with venom
Stinking in the vacant baking when he shit his denim
And now he laking with fishes with em
Cause we in them dangerous grounds
Trey pound seven spin around for my bregrin
The clouds come down
War in peace
I take it to the street
Land sharp on my lawn
Chop the thumbs off a thief
So run when I reach
You young held accountable
For gum that you preach
Tryna slum with the beast
Militia to the corpse
Round fully horsed power barrels like exhaust
And Im downed to the cross
Bout to go on a acid trap
And pull a rabbit trick
Thats harder then fucking a a fat bitch with a flaccid dick
Im living the life of a rabid pit
Getting habit kick doing gymnastic flips
In a liq plastic splish
Favorite punchline
Pass the grip
But I still slash and slish
And eat a nigga quicker than an ass or clit
I grew around a lot of broken glass plastic tips
The ghost in Christmas past the fence I was stashing gifts
Im a massive risk
Get my hands dirty and on the stretcher like I got elastic fists
Bitch
Beware I've awakened
Prepare to be shaken
Your fairly mistaken
If a jokes what I'm here to be taken
Pardon to all my students
For the hiatus today
I promise I was responsible
For the bronx marble shootings
Im Malcom And Martin Luther Mixed With all three Michaels
A part of Bruce a spritz of Prince and Marshall molecule
Psychologically, biologically, diabolical down to the follicle
A bunch of other shit y'all confused
I say fuck a truce
Handle shit how I choose
Me myself and I
And the rest of me, i keep yall to you
Everybody learning to rap
Im tryna find the school
That qualified the fools
Imma shit on and climb inside the stool
Recognize that I'm not the problem
They kinda blind the rules
They games under global warming
Im hot, your climates cool
They think they could spit
I'm dropping a vomit pool
Im not enthused
My flow is watching a comet move
Think imma choose
Life or death
Think imma lose?
Until you yabbadabbadoo out your designer shoes
Hopping out in a pair of vans
Show you how to x-games
Make you 720 and clear the fans
Im the iceman, in a ty-dye van
Watch sinister with the jigsaw and the byebyeman
And
I'm the last nigga you wanna see attacked
The difference is I be breathing but he ain't breathing back
I walk through any block Like I dont even rap
Fuck stitches we dine snitches and make them eat a rat
See I was taught crime and I fought clean
Have em screaming "WHAT ARE THOSE"
Then let off steam
Find em with posses
I binded with mobsters
Deciding which bodies should drop
Over lasagna and lobster
They say I'm koo-koo a little
The .22 is little, I'm brutal and civil
I got the M's you do the skittles
Brutal and civil eating bugles for dinner
Now you name a rapper
I snatch him for snacking his skinner
The butcher the bitches
Grew on to pushers and pitchers
Around the bushes and dishes
Get found like kush in the swishers
Holy father my holy waters
A dirty soda
I been riding dirty since diapers
Riding a dirty stroller
With a baby bottle
A milli lighters
Is my only cola
So immune to the bullshit
I probably could hold ebola
Smack his Macauley Culkin
I was a home aloner
Rock the 40 below us
