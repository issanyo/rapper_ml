[Intro: Cory Gunz]
Militia don't play
Make a bitch bend down, obey
Walking about with that trey-eight and that yappa
Razor-blade in my hand, bitch, Baraka

[Verse 1: Cory Gunz]
Wasn't even a teenager, I think
Uncle Steve with those keys like Tom Hanks
Grandma said my bitch poisoning me
Butter-scotch in that twat, that pussy so sweet
I ain't stunting on one of these fuck niggas
Talking all mmm, why won't you go get it?
Pussy nigga, this activist got me activated
And the pussy nigga you acting like got me aggravated
When I was bored we played the game, I point 'em out
We fuck you up, trip you down and stomp you out
M-T-M, F-U-B, M-M-G
I'mma get icy and ball on niggas, M-S-G

[Hook: Cory Gunz]
Walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Razor-blade in my hand, bitch, Baraka
Walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Razor-blade in my hand, bitch, Baraka

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
You know how I do
Foreign bitch, smoking weed to my groove
Fat ass in my lap, hand on my strap
Fuck around, think I'm fuckin' around, you get clapped
What's the bad? I only fondle that bread
Naw, I don't know her name, but I know that head
Naw, I don't know that lame, you don't know that's fed?
Naw, you don't know my name, if so, your ass dead
Had a girl till she didn't answer her phone
She had a man till she came and then he wasn't home
O-G and codeine got me in my zone
When you talking to a G, watch your tone

[Hook: Cory Gunz]
Nigga, I'm walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Razor-blade in my hand, bitch, Baraka
Walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa
Razor-blade in my hand, bitch, Baraka
