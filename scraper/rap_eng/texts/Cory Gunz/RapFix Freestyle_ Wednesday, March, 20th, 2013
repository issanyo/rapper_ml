[Verse 1: Corey Gunz]
Keep me a bad chick, steady lawyer, and a steady uh
Smoke my blunt to the face
What's my name? Freddy Krueger
Rich brothers, Rich sisters
I'm about to get rich witcha
Tough mother, Sick mister
Think this the game? CLICK! TWISTER!
I take bank. I don't take suggestions
Stomp yo' face to a blank expression
Roll through here like a curling iron
Let that heat change your gesture
Mouth been closed, My case is open
I been dope since trains and tokens
'Erything near, my safe is open
If you take my ish, ya take a smokin'
I been where they ain't make it back
State the facts that my bars right
I was down that pit, and got out that ish, like the bald head chick in The Dark Knight
Got chocolate brown and a vanill' ho, in between the caramel woe
Her pussy feel like a whale hole
And I give her 'eh like bilbos
And im gettin' blazed with my blazers
I get you tazed up by laser
If I ain't got the choppa I chop ya
I'mma get my raze with my razor
Mind is made on ya'll maker
It's 'bout time to pray to ya'll savior
I got pounds and pints of this ish so that's why I can't say it off paper, Nigga
Trippin' off of that perc
Grippin' off of that syrup
Lippin' off, I'll let 'em wash you up until you driftin' off: Now that's dirt
Play me, Flash trigger, Say cheese! Got two crumb straps. Galaxy KDs
Niggas couldn't see me on ATVs. I don't like pussy niggas. They make me sneeze
Call my dogs; Check these fleas
Take this D when she take this E

[Outro: Sway & Mack Maine]
