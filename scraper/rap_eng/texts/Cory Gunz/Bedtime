[Hook] x2

Sleep nigga, Bedtime
Flatlinnne, Redline
Ain't a nigga fuckin with my bread grind
Sleep nigga! Bedtime

[Verse 1]

Yeah, South Beach, freak chick, mouth piece, feet kicked
Stacking paper, need whip
Fuck you jacking hater, heat clips
Thug mode, grind zone
Nigga Oh, mind blown
Live up to my name and spot that ratchet bitch
You can find me where them killers make them caskets sit
Paper chasers, dominated
New nigga, nominated
Chyea, everybody and they momma hated
I don't give a fuck about the commentating
Chyea ha! I be around that yay like J
Never hustled but I'll bust Trey like Ray
On a nice day, that's word to vice, yay
That's how them real niggas roll the dice play!

[Verse 2]

Yeah, fuck it let em' hate a nigga made it
These niggas say it but it's never demonstrated
Talkin all this baller sportin but its not illustrated
Niggas snitchin if I diss em I get litigated
You need twenty-thousand on your whip for daytons
Nigga I blew twenty-thousand just on shit to skate in
You smoking regular shit, rollin raddish
That's prolly why your d*** gotta fuckin a****
Yeahhh, Snow flowin like the fuckin Boss
You suckas soft, sucka soft
She said she love it when I rap fast
I twark fast She nab ahhhh!
