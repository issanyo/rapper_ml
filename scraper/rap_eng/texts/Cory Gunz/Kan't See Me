[Verse 1: Cory Gunz]
Killin' the set, spend like a million a mic put in the tec
Shout out to the niggas that are never getting respect
Balls in your mouth with a dick in your neck
Pullin work, now I’m feelin stretch
I’mma get mine like I invented the dead
Niggas say I’m trash, I don’t wanna get an A
So much people on the crib that I never really met
Old fashion, I’ve been a long time coming
Youngin' on the conner with the .45 dummy
Ain't no confusion of course start gunning
You don’t wanna make music, with yours I’m drumming
Can’ put me in a room, put me in a room full of squirties and of shooters and of hoodies in the boots
Quit the fronting, I’mma run em, run em on the automatic
Everybody know I have the money to recruit nigga
Real nigga on that asshole
Cops knocks, said I’m gone, get a warrant, I ain’t home
High school sweetheart, turnin yo bitch
Everything I thing im looking for is only in the uterus
Someone gettin money, Niggas that I’m movin with, they’d probably get you dumb
Easy to fuck, to get you fooled with what I’m on my mind
Y'all on my dick
No metaphors, thats just true shit
Red nigga smoking on a quarter of the new one
Rolls Royce drink with the daughter of you
At least two stacks, blowin all three
We offed, ever offered em all on you
G17, each in the neck
You rich nigga , you should throw loop on your neck
I ain’t heard anybody say they have one of the best
And I ain’t never seen the lights

[Hook]
Niggas kant see me, niggas kant see me
Niggas kant see me, niggas kant see me
Niggas niggas do them, Niggas niggas do them, Niggas kant see me
Niggas kant see me, niggas kant… fuck that
Niggas kant be me, (blood) niggas kant be me
Niggas kant be me, niggas kant be me
Niggas niggas niggas do them,Niggas niggas do them, Niggas kant see me

(God just make a man of you… just be
God just make a man of you… just be)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Nigga here we go again
Drop another killer whenever I hold a pen
When I’m in the mussy I don’t wanna be your friend
And then I beat a nigga, hit him like it’s never gonna end
And you know I’m comin the way I gotta defend it
And I’m killin everything until they family regret it
And I tell em every time until I really think they get it
Til a nigga let it go and now somebody need a medic
Nigga want a problem, I’m thinkin you’d better get it
You don’t wanna see the footage, somebody showed you a edit
(heard when I say?)
Well em again I said it
I’m not shittin on these niggas, I know everybody smell it
All these names aren’t here
And I’m the nicest, I’m the greatest, I appreciate the credit
I ain’t gotta do and let another nigga tell it
Nigga think shit, sweet bitch, diabetic
They I stun em and I hit em
And I got em and I get em and I rock em and I send em up
Then I lock em when I winning
And I park it in a minute then I cock it and I hit em up
Yes! When it’s time to say it, believe me I gotta go
Securing the win but getting a lot of dough
Everything I touch you see that you gotta blow
Hit me in the cut, hit him in the gut
Begging to be swept til another club shut
See me proper, gotta give it up
GT rocker, all up in my cup
Come here Shawty, you could tell em that I little made me tinkle in yo butt
Even if I give it to em in 3D
Let’s be clear, you can never see me

[Hook]
Niggas kant see me, niggas kant see me
Niggas kant see me, niggas kant see me
Niggas niggas do them, Niggas niggas do them, Niggas kant see me
Niggas kant see me, niggas kant… fuck that
Niggas kant be me,(blood) niggas kant be me
Niggas kant be me, niggas kant be me
Niggas niggas niggas do them, Niggas do them, Niggas kant see me

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Movin on a mission with a mac
Can’t find your way to my position with a map
But I’m on the bronze on, in the kitchen with the crack
Hit the birds more important, and the bitches in the back
Yea mine gon stop, never would I do that, yea
Going harder than they thought i would've last year
Chains gonna put it on the game, put it on my chain
Swear they actin funny when I’m back there
They out here but you something
I’m too loco, they semi-dumb
I don’t understand her, you don’t understand me
Understand that you don’t understand (you understand?)
Shit nigga, you don’t understand
She want a real nigga, she don’t want a man
Got you here but your coach is choosing
Nigga now exposed, and nigga we’re out of playin
I do me, I do me
I’m doing my drill, I’m grinding you
Back when I rap, I’m attacking the track
By beat and the beat got a rivalry
Streets that I sleep where the bible be
Got her free at suite, can’t idol me
YMC entitle me
And out this bitch where I will be
Fly to the moon, off to the stars
Hoping all them niggas call from the car
Oh Lord like whenever I get off of the job
I go hard like off you, what they offering ya?
Really wanna get into the bigger but I’m ready for the war
Nigga all be avoided if yall avoid

[Hook]
Niggas kant see me, niggas kant see me
Niggas kant see me, niggas kant see me
Niggas niggas do them, Niggas niggas do them, Niggas kant see me
Niggas kant see me, niggas kant… fuck that
Niggas kant be me, niggas kant be me
Niggas kant be me, niggas kant be me
Niggas niggas do them,Niggas niggas do them, Niggas kant see me
