[Intro: 2 Chainz]
YA!
Cory what's happenin'?
(2 Chainz!)
YMCMB

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Okay now mama had a nigga
Nigga had some problems
Then it's zero zero zero comma, a piranha
Wa-water whip, anything in my circumference
Got that work, dancing like it's fucking Bently Fonzworth
Concert, monster, my feet too long for Converse
Louis V all over me, I'mma need a brown hearse
Encore, dead fresh, hair weave on my head rest
Supercalifragilistic, I'mma need a spell check
Fuck around and get you dog shot, I'm a damn vet
How you have an AK and get killed by a Kel-Tec?
Duhh, I be going dumb
She 21 with Chinese eyes I call her Soo Yung
Pockets on croissant
Bread over anything
I'm busting like I'm getting me some head at a shooting range
2 Chainz!

[Hook: Cory Gunz]
Tell them niggas I won't stop stunting
Long as I won't stop wanting, fronting
Y'all ain't got nothing on me
Tell them niggas I won't stop stunting
Long as I won't stop wanting, fronting
Y'all ain't got nothing on me
I said, tell them niggas I won't stop stunting
Long as I won't stop wanting, fronting
Y'all ain't got nothing on me
I'm the fast talking pimp of the year, the year

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
2 Chainz I got you
Yo, look what my flow bout
Make a niggas head spin til his eyes fall out
My team the machine, niggas not gon doubt
What I mean is all my Autobots roll out
Never gave a fuck about a cop or scout
Get ya little cub chopped, then I flop on the couch
And just watch like y'all, when I hop on the bounce
Kill the booth, hear the blood, can't stop Cor now
Sip drink, I don't bottle pop, pour it out
For my niggas on lock, on the block or the ground
Moving more tops than a hot whore house
Couldn't fuck with me then, who can stop Cor now?
Smoke like a blunt, other shot call style
Call pigs, you a chicken, put the Glock on the cow
Paper describes, you ain't got no nouns
Young Money Cash Money until I go down
When the Mills ring you is not all loud
You don't wanna take a last shot throw the towel
Pound for Pound, we the Pound for Pound
Pull up on my nigga BOW, Nigga y'all go Wow
Didn't know then nigga y'all know now
2 Chainz got the crowd on loud
We do things, Stop ho how?
How could I ever let her knock cor now?
Flex from the X nigga to the A-Town
This dedicated to the niggas stayin' down
Going into the village with a tree ho
Then you about to take cor dooown!

[Hook: Cory Gunz]
