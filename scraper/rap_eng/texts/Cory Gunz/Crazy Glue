[Cory Gunz:]
Hold Up
Lil Dutty
Whoa Nelly
If It Ain't Exotic Den I'm Not Rollin It
If It Stink So Good Like The Indo Should
If It's In My Pocket I'll Burn A Hole In It
Smoke Clouds In The Whip Like Pole In It
So High It Ain't Mine Think I Might've Stolin It
It'll Be Fine Nice Time
Nothin Like A Tight Rhyme
N A Couple Like Crimes I Like To Go With It
Pineapple Blueberry Get A Bowl Of It
Strawberry Kush Hey Get A Load Of It
Get A Doobie Get A Dutch Get A Swisha Get A Philly
Get A Cup Nigga Any Kind Of Way To Role With It
Sour Or The Dro With It
{Show Spinnin I'm Loosin Focus
