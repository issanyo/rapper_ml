[Intro : Cory Gunz]

Yeah
Heard the voice, saw the face, made the choice
Young Money, Cash Money, Militia Gangs own Cory Gunz nigga
And 600 niggas man, Edai lets get this, turn up, Lets Go!

[Hook : Cory Gunz]

Niggas dont want no smoke [x14]

[Verse : Cory Gunz]

Pussy niggas ain't savage
I put them on a motherfucking plate
Hit him in his chest
Flip him on his back
Strip him out his stacks
And rip open his motherfucking face
Militia gang nigga where I post
So 174 for the bread
Where they blow the toast
Leave a nigga dead where he stand
Thinking he ain't close
Showed a nigga, nah, you was wrong
Man i'm in the smoke
I ain't for the jokes
Or for the emotional shit
Fuck an innocent
When I spit a sentence on sentence
On any citizen in intent of soliciting
The message is you would be living
If you were listening
I pull up in an ice cream truck
Ice man with an ice pick
And an ice grip right hand
With a night stick
And a vice grip, spike handle
Chained to sawed off
Spray can the bottle is hollow either way
Im turning your motherfucking project
Into a school in Colorado either way
You ain't in New York
Then its a problem either way
I got 600 niggas in Chicago either way
Then ride up on the scene
Militia get the drop
When the opp nigga shot him in the brain
Niggas wearing fake shit lying on the name
Fucking up the outfit
Put the iron on the lane
I'm in it for me
Family first, cause niggas is in it for cheese
Trying to get out of prison
And ain't even been in it, sheesh
Fuck out the kitchen if niggas is fishing
But can't be willing to sit in the grease
Chicken dip nigga
Never will, Never was, Never could
Be part of Milita clique nigga
Two hands up on the pistol grip nigga
Cory ain't the one you want an issue with NIGGA!

[Edai]
Ayy Gunz what up bro
You know how we rock man
060
Steve Drive shit
Gang

[Hook : Edai]

Nigga you dont want no smoke [x2]

[Verse 2 : Edai]
I say, real nigga i tell em
My juveniles and my felons
All these nigga they ready
Ain't no telling who telling
Niggas they talking we nail em
So under rated they dont give me no credit
Bullet in his head won't get him no medic
Fuck that opp nigga tell him i said it
Huh
Riding around bronx with militia
Niggas act tuff and they tissue
You don't really want beef nigga
Know you seen Rondo on the nine with the missile
I be on the grind trying to get it where I'm from
Niggas dying from the iron trying to get it
600 niggas outside with it
You ain't riding with it
Then my niggas outside riding around it
600 block all wild niggas
See a opp on the block and we zone out nigga
Head shot lose your top we some young wild niggas
You ain't ever on your block
You should come out nigga
30 shots hit your block
How that gun sound nigga
5 rounds everybody on the fucking ground nigga
Got a gun? you ain't ever made a fucking sound nigga
Say 600 on your highway
How the fuck it sound nigga?
GANG!
Lets get it
