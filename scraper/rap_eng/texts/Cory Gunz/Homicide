[Chorus:]
Pull up on his block like what it's hitting for
2 Glocks automatic start to bitching bro
Lil Trey about a fiend where the dope
187 let the killers go
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide

[Verse 1: Trav]
Choppa with me even when I'm in the foreign
Catch a body nigga early in the morning
Sweatpants so I can run up right up on him
30 shots won't miss a nigga
Run out bullets pistol whip a nigga
I don't need no sentiments from niggas
No hand guns send them out
Where these niggas I'll clean them up
Get real close give them 50 shots
You know the new dance make him Milly Rock
Walk off then I Diddy bop
(What if you miss nigga) then I spend the block
Niggas know I ain't never been no bitch nigga
I ain't never been no snitch nigga
All I do is send hits nigga
Drop bags off and then hit niggas
Make a pussy bleed like menopause
Nigga been a fraud nigga I been a boss
Marksman the way I pick them off
Let a shot go jump in a Porsche
Selena wearing my bag nigga
Name [?] bring Trav nigga
Shootouts on the ave nigga
Ask anybody I ship bags nigga
That's facts nigga

[Chorus:]
Pull up on his block like what it's hitting for
2 Glocks automatic start to bitching bro
Lil Trey about a fiend where the dope
187 let the killers go
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Y'all don't really want militia to get it
You over shit you shouldn't did in your literature
If I I'm on my bitch Ima sick the pit at you
Cory fulla loaded clip is my signature
Smith and Wesson with the kit it'll finish you
Niggas standing next to the kid are miniatures
Spark a deuce Marques Houston was immature
Act like you was parking who Ima scrimmage you
You know my side homicide
Nigga Ima ride
When it's drama llama leave them traumatized
Want to harmonize leave your mama fried, caramelized
You'll be paralyzed before you realize
Caught 2 on top nigga snail eyes
We get locked up you get terrorized
And we tell lies and the bail bonds
A well 9 held mine
Rather take life than get jail time
On a big bike we rail lines
Let them hang tight like for sale signs
Trav told me get the stacks Gunner
Watch the macs blaze if you tread lines
Tw drops in your face nigga like clear eyes
When the flare rise bitch

[Chorus:]
Pull up on his block like what it's hitting for
2 Glocks automatic start to bitching bro
Lil Tre about a fiend where the dope
187 let the killers go
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide

[Verse 3: King Jigg]
Got choppas no display
Right from the k
Put a skunk on the top in case you run away
Bout to put in pay lil nigga can't hop out like Trey
Got a [?] with a double pump Ima show him how to work the gauge
Nigga do we have a problem
Back to rock it out from the back of trump like Marlon
Ride around with the AR in the front seat like New Orleans
Some dirty niggas got 30s on them and they strapped up and they mobbing
I turn into Hitler when I'm on a mission
It's 187 we coming to get him
Thinking I'm cripping and spending I'm lifting you make a decision when you came the victim
Tied in the basement he screaming and bitching
I [?] knocks with that Rambo
Neck cut die slow
When we pull up let the chop go

[Chorus:]
Pull up on his block like what it's hitting for
2 Glocks automatic start to bitching bro
Lil Tre about a fiend where the dope
187 let the killers go
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide
Another day another homicide
