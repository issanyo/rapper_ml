[Hook x2: Prodgy & Cory Gunz]
Rapping is my religion
Brings me the finest women
Gives me them eight figures
Cause we some Great Spitters [Prodigy]

Respect that M O B B
D Double E P
Real rap, real shit, real spit
Niggas pray when they see me [Cory Gunz]

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
It's that real conversation, my mu'fuckin' occupation
Hitman I body that with a contiac, with a track, I slay it
With a little bit of grass, little bit of class
Little bit of brashness I mix it up, till it's just enough
To have me on that best rap list
It's that empire state shit, where we love the entire nation
Niggas that want to stunt on us, they deserve to die, don't try my patience
Paint prov, like a bass kick, thank God, I erase this, big boy to head boy
Take that as a fuckin' favor
I know, I know, I know, you niggas think P be poppin' shit
And probably don't know that everything P be poppin' is
Louder than words, my niggas ain't clowns, we not herbs
I bounce yo head off that curb, I'm just a rhymin' expert
What you niggas want me to be, your Grim Reaper see?
I can see through you snake ass eyes
And you know misery loves company, and they hate when they see me shine
See these dimes, see this cash, see me on tour with the infamous
I'll see you in hell, my gun ring bells, puts all that bullshit to rest

[Hook x2: Prodgy & Cory Gunz]

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
I've got niggas on lock, doin' time
Cleanin' Mac's, right off the block, movin' dimes
Who wanna ride, where to?
Chicks told me I'd be there in a year or two
Goin' at the mall, corners appear poof
Death is just around the corner, it's here too
Got a little brother, I'mma give a better life
Beautiful little girl's I'mma put to bed at night
I was 12 in the kitchen, when they let in white
R.I.P. my nigga Beretta Mike
I'm affiliated with the renegades
I don't got juice, pop you, now I'm Minute Maid
In the bucks we trust, when they lust me
I'll be givin' a fuck to dust into disgust we bust
Mom left me, she was too young, she would've kept me
Still wouldn't be able to run, bad-ass loud tell a nigga to hum
Dessert too hot nigga eat wit ya tongue
Militia, Mobb Deep, YMCMB, I'm done
Like Charlie, see me have a gun
Tell an old girl, party with a nigga til' one
She got a body, harder to beat on a gun

I got keys to the spot with a G and a Pump
D's on the block just screamin' to jump
P tell 'em stop 'fore I be in the front
When niggas get caught, catch me if you want (x2)
