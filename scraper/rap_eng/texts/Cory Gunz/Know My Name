[Verse 1]
What, yeah I’m on nigga run up
I’m runnin’ with the jim blade in my fitted now
Fuck around with me and get knitted down
So much green can't remember the last time I shitted brown
Thirsty niggas ain't admitting they bitter sound
Now I’m hungry to show em I’m the hottest fucking kid around
Show em how it go I dont kid around
Fuck ya crew and label go get a town
And set off and spit around
YMCMB in the bee and pee on ya bean
Why and if I see em tell em I wouldn't wanna be em
Run off gun out, gun off run out
Fuck the what nigga bring the fun out
Militia gang rap for the dumb out
Try me for a come up
I bet ya niggas raps never come out
Smooth drinking swigga with a temper like a flicker
On the itchy finger nigga pour the liquor on the victim goin

Gunz Militia Pop
Show these little niggas I’m not playing games
I’m a pro with the dot I’m a cold nigga pop
Like cash with the flames
Gunz Militia Pop
Show these little niggas I’m not playing games

[Verse 2]
What, bitch nigga you ain't saying shit
I got business on the block, Amber, Wayne and Nick
If ain't depending on the watch then we made em sick
I knew a witness on the watch who became a vic
Had a wife of a life that became a bitch
Most my niggas lay the bricks so they lay in bricks
Or they laying bricks
I love the south like potato grits
But I bet whatever if you say the knicks
My niggas midwest with a plate of fix
Staged up and off the dimes and they making knicks
Caught a jooks by mistake I ain't mean to get em
Shit, he was the trick he ain’t need to spend em
See me in any whips bet the nina’s in em
Gimme Christinas lips put the penis in em
My closet looking like I got a cleaners in em
Ya’ll ain't poppin tommy’s ya’ll are just alotta gleamers with em
