[Intro]
Fuck it, don't nobody got me but me x3
Fuck it, you know what I got it

[Verse 1]
If you don't know my government, why should we politic
If I load up the slugs, then it might be a hollow tip
Everybody's snitching, I don't know who to trust
Even niggas we grew watching, who tutored us
I'm loyal to me cause that's all that I owe
You call it beef and I call that a show
(If it was lifted your shit would've been my niggas hit)
Fuck is you watching me for, you can't get on these benefits
Grandma at home watching Ellen DeGeneres
I'm in a room rolling L's with degenerates
The hoes on Monroe and my platinum just dangling
So many chains don't get mad at the tangling
Niggas was hating their crushes was crushing on Cory
All I want is the respect with the money, the power, the glory
(I rap people with money), I play the town with my forty
I gotta come up, they know I've been down since shorty
Straight up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I don't call nobody, my problems my problems
(No Cory tell on me em) I shot em, I shot em
I'm rapping like this, cause you dickheads don't listen to straight lyrics
When I finish this I'll be upset and won't know what to make of it
Niggas will stand by your side and go lie on in front of your mommy
That's why I put rocks on my middle finger and I'm like, "fuck you, try me"
I can see envy and hate in the eyes of a lot of you niggas
I keep the semi in place by my side for a lot of you niggas
(Passion like pocket) and I'm Woody like Biggie
I'm more like the LOX and Will Smith, but I'm jiggy
Nigga creep or get crept on and get clapped in your crevasses
Auntie left home, I've pulled back my beretta since
Bitch I want the power like Edison
I ain't out of my mind, I just found out what head it's in
I don't think with my dick, so I guess where the bread is then
But don't get it twisted, if she 'bout that paper then spread it then
Word fuck her

[Hook]
