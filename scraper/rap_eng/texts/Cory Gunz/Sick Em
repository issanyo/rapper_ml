[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Okay, wake up in the morning
Break a swisher
Turn to a model like Eva Pigford
Hop up out the bed in the Gucci slippers
Tell MTV I'm a made nigga
With all this dirty money, need a maid nigga
If you think you a beast, my cage bigger
True I see food, sick has checked out the ICU
If you look into my eyes, red like T2
I'm about to shut it down, tell them niggas reboot
Baby I could spend it all, it ain't shit to recoupe
In the building throwing money off the roof like juice
Everyday's Christmas, you feel the presents
I get right inside the building like it's September 11th
Raise a glass for the fallen, hope they get the message
Ill said sick 'em, I told him get a medic

[Chorus]
I took a look inside the mirror, mirror on the wall
This is what it saw, I'm the sickest of 'em all
I'm the sickest of 'em all, you ain't sick at all
'Bout to turn into a beast, gon' sick 'em dog
Gon' sick 'em dog, I'mma get 'em all
I said I be getting off
'out to turn into a beast
Gon' sick 'em dog

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Yeah, I am at all the sickest one, I live this rap shit like this gat shit
Women you would know the Gun, by high school I was so gone so drawn by the battle
I would get a pass, spit a punch little line, let a little lunch fly get to class
Now there's no more of that, just me how I shoulda done right
Ink said Hell no Gunz, what why? What I ain't tatted enough to be on Alumni?
Catch the same body, with the same shotty, the same side of me, tears tatted under the same eye
I go hard like I'm playing for the game, I know y'all niggas want to get in but you can't try
Cause they got so many rich niggas in this Militia, that I could talk about a killer like I can't die
K I, if they gon' peep tell 'em peep up, bling
But even with my upkeep, they couldn't keep up
To think all that talking ain't dig a sinking ship
Niggas leaking Militia more than a sink'll drip
But I don't think of shit, I'm learning at this war
Sometimes you gotta leave the bag burning at the door
Cause now the joke is on you niggas, tryna kick the fire
Cause now it's Cash Money and they all as sick as I am

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Money talks nigga, so what the fuck you saying?
Put up or shut up, if you ain't paying, you ain't playing
10 toes down I'm on my feet
7 thou a show, 7 shows in the week
I ain't stupid rich but I'm hella comfy
Getting money, 100 thousand in the Louis duffy
Together we live, divided we die
Young Money, fly team boy we live in the sky
My daddy said before he died, look a man in his eye
Read 'em like a book, you can tell the truth from a lie
Promised my mamma she'll be riding in the coupe 'fore I die
And my flow gon get us everything we wanted no lie
Fuck it I'm itching for the limelight
And they say Gudda you should wait until the times right
And I'm like nah nigga, I want it now, I want it now I'm not waiting
Cause the flow blazing and I'm hot like Satan so

[Chorus]
