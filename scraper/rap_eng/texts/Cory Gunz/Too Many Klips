[Hook: Flow]
Ok I'm bout to make a move so you better 86
Cuz I be coming through with shit that's separating bricks
You got a broken tool then you better get it fixed
Ain't no missing you because I got too many clips
Got too many clips
Got too many clips
Ain't no missing you because I got too many clips
Got too many clips
Got too many clips
Ain't no missing you because I got too many clips
Ok ok ok

[Verse 1: Flow]
Brought a new desert eagle, and I'll point that motherfucka
Dead at yo Mohawk
Got kicked outta school cuz of niggas like you we were jumping bitch niggas in the court yard
Get beat like a dope charge
T shirt lookin like a nigga wipe snowballs
Wear my hair like O-dog
In the front of N.O. gun long like crow bars
(Now O-Dog was the craziest nigga alive. America's nightmare. Young, black, and didn't give a fuck.)
That nigga know he don't pray, I pulled out the gun the first thing he said was, "Oh Lord"
I kidnap a fuck nigga
And if they pay up send him back with his toe off
And if they sent my extra, then I'll send that motherfucka back wit a postcard
I'm a rapper, but a niggas still playing with the keys like Mozart
Sip lean finna doze off
OG so strong more gas than a go cart
This that motherfuckin' crack, and that nigga tried to turn the motherfuckin' stove off
Watch how quick a nigga go off
No credit but I better pull yo motherfuckin' whole card
Take a nigga hoe nigga tried to cock block
Now a nigga on a lost like four yards

[Hook]
Ok I'm bout to make a move so you better 86
Cuz I be coming through with shit that's separating bricks
You got a broken tool then you better get it fixed
Ain't no missing you because I got too many clips
Got too many clips
Got too many clips
Ain't no missing you because I got too many clips
Got too many clips
Got too many clips
Ain't no missing you because I got too many clips
Ok ok ok

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
I get it all off the books, I'm off the wall take off the chain
Keep it funky as a mouth ball
You ain't gotta go and yet draw the change
I gotta cop a top, that'll pop ya top, send yo block through up bibbidi-bob-di-bop
Or hit 'em up mentality who shot you bop
Put the pump to yo chest like a doctor
Pockets full of rockets
Stop and pop stock it
Flaggin' and bump YG like I'm from Bompton
Bag in it (paper tag in it)
Smokin' race (straight to dragon it)
Young Money Cash Money militia that been snitch assassins
And windows clap when it is its that
Simple yes in fact this is an example of who not to rap with
Stop the traffic
Sock, ass kick, pop plastic
Drop the casket
Popped his whole front, backflip, that gun
The boy's a bastard
Employable after the .40 explode
Let him deploy the captive appoint and catch it
Run tell the feds my guns now I'm a feds
Now I'm fuckin' high Aladdin and Jasmine
Word to anyone I had class wit, my gas spit Ms. Kasmin
Don't get paid to box butut ain't afraid of hits
Like you afraid of shots and that's a package
Told my nigga Flow when I hit the N.O
I'll be on the eastside and a nigga thick hoe
What is he a pit bro
When the three unzip whoa
When you see this four

Ain't no missing you because I got too many clips
