Im in a bad mood
Push it, push it, go 'head and push it
Cat food, pussy pussy
I said it, pussy
Fuck a hater, what they gon' say
That they hater fuckers
Razor, blader, grenader jugger
Fileta sucker
Day to day I suffer
Kept the train and my favorite trucker
They concernin'
Take the burners, determine to make the summer
I ain't a gangsta
But that ain't takin' the gangsta from us
I swear to my borders
I'll take the orders and shank your mother
Caught up in makin' mothers
Repay for mistaken brothers
A fade in the spade
You can play them cards in the basement under
My chest is a locket box
No comma for taken numbers
Unless its a profit, you plot to stop it
You the naked runner
Chase you
Baby gunners been able
Take 'em fables
A ray mistake
Boy, i'll mangle your face
Then lace up your ankles
To scrape the staples
Disgraceful
Fuck a rapper, today I could take the label
I'll make an earthquake as stable
Rip my shirt and shake the table
Wait
How am I what a ? I am what I am
Llama quiet the drama
Time to silence my lamb
I can name on my hand
Top 5 on my hand
Me, me, me, me, me
Me's all that came on my hand
Gorilla thoughts
I'm an ape with a plan
Killer bars, blow your brain on your mans
I been outta my mind, before outta my mind
Give me some potter, Harry
I'm Harry Potter with rhyme
Height of a spiders flight, parkour with climb
Writers the dark of night, with my partners in crime
Call straight as a bow, i'm an archer with mind
Straight as a row, Bobby Vargo with mind
Call a conquerer's corner, an auto-viner to con
And then leavin' know that your co-eds
The co-ed writer's confine
I creep the side of the jeep
And then sleep to sneak through the fog
And I murder you all and go speak to my dog
