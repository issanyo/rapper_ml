I count my peso, bad little bitch going when I say so
Real nigga better lay low

Bitch goin' with the team tho
Bad bitch you ain't going what you mean tho
Pull up in a foreign ho got it on me case a nigga want smoke

[Verse 1: Tray Savage]
Pull up in a foreign ho bitch goin' bitch goin' what you mean tho
Hit his block with the Glock tucked little nigga, little nigga better lay low
Just for that peso then lay a nigga down at his front door
Little bitch what you mean tho ain't no movin' for that peso
Smoke dope with the lean ho fall out but a nigga won't try me tho
Brain dead who I came for
When a little nigga yawn I'm at his front door
Smoke dope with the lean ho fall out but a nigga won't try me tho
Move shit like Rambo little niggas do you really really hear me tho

Stomp niggas in my steel toe, stendo to window you can feel those
Mushrooms when they peel tho
Flesh wound, chest wounds can't  heal those
Your bitch knows what its in fo

We got shot but not in the whip doe
Hot do your research, and those niggas  know how we work
I met a nigga dead on, she owns me
Head on, you need to speak first
Stop acting like a B-boy
Snitch niggas lacking give him D-coys
When a bad day its like re-toys
You might die, I can't stop flee-roy
Rolling up with the gray white
We smoking on the east-side with G-boy

Click pop a nigga like a ki-lowd
