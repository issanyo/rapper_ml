[Verse 1]
You know I keep a cannon
Wherever I'm standing
First get the stamin
Burst get to blamin
Wallets get to dropping
Purses get to handin
Shots get to choppin
Church get to jamming
(Pray bitch) it's militia
Toast to the g game
Twist a nigga, rope em up
Tryna hang how we hang
Give me an evil eye
This isn't my planet
Wasn't intended ended if it hit and then it landed
Ballers on they're new court
Niggas move when I move
You could talk what you port
I'm a shoot when I move
Actin like a dick head
Betta keep it whipin
This is a new era
My whole teams fitted
It's M up till I'm M down
Niggas see the logo
I ain't got it in me to kill em, how do they know so
Never saw me bang out
But truthlessly, ruthlessly, with the ooz you bruise profusively, groosemly till you drain out

[Hook]
You know I keep a cannon
They waiting for my wake so I sleep with the cannon
I creep with the cannon
Cause I be stackin money, niggas be actin funny
So I be actin dummy
I eats with the cannon, I shits with the cannon
Comma, cannon, Obama with the cannon, osama with the cannon
I'm affiliated with the drama, with the cannon, I'm affiliated when it's drama, get the cannon

[Verse 2]
Why am I violent
Siolent in my moment
All of my components
Will never be opponents
Only thing I trust, cory gunz got a loaded
If they don't pay respects, why I send you a condolence
In case you didn't notice
Nigga this is my time
Front and get your back ache
Tryna run on my nine
Put the bread on your head
Enough for you to wonder
How I turn a beauty rest into one that you do under
Typical, despicable, irresistible, criminal, intentional, gimmical, mental conventional, lyrical, subliminal, instruments, sentimentalist, send ya mentalist and ventriloquist, all the fibrulous you blunder

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Gimme some room
Got the pump with the strap
So the strap is the pump
Ju-ju-jump at the jack
Got the cannon for drama
Call that drama with cannon
Gangsta grillz on yo bitch asses, ya'll understanding
We don't be giving a fuck
We be giving it up
It's militia till dust
Nigga stick or get stuck
