They told me to do it, so I'mma do it
Gunz
Militia
Young Money.
Bitch!
UOENO it (x3)

[Verse: Cory Gunz]
What?
Bitch, I been poppin', UOENO it
No 50, Diddy, Jay signed me with Tommy Mottola, UOENO it
I'd die for Wayne, Mack Maine, those my big bros and they already know it
'Bout to cop a truck, but can't drive cause I ain't got a license. UOENO it
My baby girl put a four in my favorite soda, I ain't even pour it
Ran a shower for me, wear the outfit and twist the loud. I ain't even roll it
She ridin' with me, get rowdy with me. She blowing, I ain't even hold it
Get violent with me. She silent, you can get shot and UOENO it
Young Money Cash Money, ho
Stomp on the gas when he flow
Ain't nobody fucking with me, anybody tell you differently, I'mma definitely smash on these hoes
Evidently, I'm a threat and I be wrecking many niggas reckoning to do a record with me. I'm not a recommendee
I'll kneel left on the knee and pray death all on me, before I ever let 'em catch up with me
Hol' up, I'm losing 'em
Now I gotta start all over, UOENO it
These niggas dumb, I'm rappin' out here all slow. Cause they even know it
Caught a charge, but I'm going hard. Ain't stop nothing, UOENO it
The last single I was on had a million sold and UOENO it, bitch
Keep it street. You already know it
No spam. I get paid for my tweets, UOENO it

[Outro: Cory Gunz]
You don't need to know it
Told you I was gonna do it. That's it
