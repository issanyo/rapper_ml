[ Verse 1: Cory Gunz]
You ain't about that, nigga, bitch, made nigga
Pop that nigga, you ain't hear that, nigga
You ain't counting this, nigga, you ain't getting that, nigga
No license, but my whip here, nigga and my grip here, nigga
Get a grip here, nigga, take a trip there, nigga
Straight trip there, nigga, F N 57 N 447, 4544, 357 more weapons
Got a football ring, black diamonds on my finger
It's a hood ball thing, shining on these niggas
Black diamonds on my ear, black diamonds on my wrist
Black diamonds on my neck that's why I'm in your bitch

Want a pair of red bottoms you better jump those mics
You better scuff them tims, drop them chucks
One pair of shell tops , you better tie them hoes up
