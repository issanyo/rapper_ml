Verse 1
Bad Bitches on deck
Call me Hugh Hefner I got bad pictures on desk
Mad kisses on chest
All the honeys to the right
‘gnak, spliff is on left
Angelina Jolie lips, Brad Pitt is on, yes!
Give it all that you got
She like my kicks and like the new watch
I’m a thug beneath the sheets, you could spend a night with 2pac
And she’s trying to start all over when the indescribable stops
And this place is already taken, tell your friend to find a new spot
Stop bugging
My cheek is Dutch and foreign
Your trick is f**king boring
Zip her zip won’t stop with stalling
My cheek just struck a bargain
Men! She’s willing to cross the margin
She’s tight and real special and your cheek you could park a car in
Tell me where you found her?
My cheek real thick and rounder
I bet you’re itching to pound her
You’re thinking of sticking it down there
No thanks, No pranks
No Pole dance, romance
She slow dance, go H.A.M
She blows men! , no hands

[Hook]
Ridin' round smoking Explainweed with my foreign bitch
Ridin' round smoking weed with my foreign bitch, foreign bitch
My window down on ridin' to my new shit
Got my new bitch, got my got my new bitch
I don’t camp out for no J's they sell them hoes for free
Never payin' for no pussy fuck them hoes for free
Badd bitches on deck

Verse 2
Sound Cloud, My sound Wow!
I ride to death, my town vow
I touch her chest, that gown down!
I rock, I flex and count pounds
And dollars too
Sip Malibu
Rock Timberlands without Magoo
You could bring your friends, we could laugh and booze
Wanna sip and spend with the swagger crew
Like an emcee, I got my composure
Touching her knees, her back will bend over
Puffing those trees, we got the hangover
F**k and just leave; don’t have to Van Gogh her!
No sketch, no paintings, no drawings
No stress, no patience, no calling
Won’t catch no cases, no Florence!
It’s over, go darling!
Luggage’s packed up
My crib aren’t a place you could shack up
My fist and your face it will match up
Fix lips and the braids, better sag up
MARTA bus it comes at eight
Grab your stuffs, no hugs no shakes
Slam the doors and I draw my drapes
I’ll clip my fingers before I pay
I hit and run it’s like road kill
My sh** is done I just close deal
Magic show – on to the next trick
Baddest ho, you deserve gift
Hit the road, I just swerve, shift
Talk is cheap: you aren't worth sh**
Baddest rapper, I’m a wordsmith
Ask about me' I murk sh**

[Hook]
