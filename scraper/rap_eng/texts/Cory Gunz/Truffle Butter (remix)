(Verse)
If it ain’t about the plan
Don’t ask about Wayne and Birdman
They going through some shit you could neva afford or understand
That’s my muthafuckin’ fam
Teach me how to ball, Jordan Jackson on jam
If I ain’t the wittiest, grittiest
In the city of pitiless
Threw the prettiest, shittiest
In the viddy, but really miss
To my city I’m Diddy
I’m Vanilli to my milli
I swear I been on them titties
Since I got off them titty
Bring the duffle to Gudda
Tell em truffle the butter
It's in the trunk with yo mother
She try to scuffle, then cut her
Didn’t hear from you, Cory
Some of them wanted you under
Because they scared of you, Cory
They want no trouble, no wonder
Then free my nigga Meek Milly
Told em stay out in Philly
I violate my probation
So he teach me how to wheelie
In the BX with billies
I’m with GS in Harlem
I got the PS 90
Ya want a piece of the problem
I go to me for advice
I’ll leave you astray
I got the bracelets from David, Eliott
Did the Ring
Thank you for the watch
And thank you for the chain
They be runnin’ to cops
I can’t give you the names
But nigga… (you know)

(Verse 2)
Everything I turn up and go
I be killin’ shit like y’all ain’t neva heard it befo
I write the murderous flow
I go to ___________________(?)
Told me stay on yo shit
And then blow you out like you winnin'
Meet a mountain of women
They know I’m out on the sinnin’
I had to (?) and replenish
Then get the down at beginnin’
I fuck all ‘em feelings
I got some powerful friends
Accountants and business
They shut you down independent
When on grind, I admit it
Niggas sound like ya finished
I’m makin’ shit at me mix
Shut ya down don’t need clearance
Cuz I’ll run you in circles
Get it from Universal
I’m on fo’ Henny and (?)
This ain’t none of the purple
If you fuck with any yay and money up the refferal
Will leave his ass Richard Gere stuck with a gerbil
Free my niggas (**laughing**)
Middle fingers up to the turtles
With a bad Triny gyal
And I’m suckin’ her solo
I ain’t neva had clam but I’m luvin’ her pearl
Niggas act like they in luv with everything but their girl
If you fight fo’ love you’ll end up die fo’ this shit
Ask around, I’d prolly sold a .45 where you live
Nigga, I’ll knock the cable out of yo kid
Yo kid out of the cradle, the cradle outta yo crib
I’ll swing a blade from yo fuckin’ navel side of yo ribs
Been all, and my niggas got it like Dibs
Yeah! I’ll make a fuckin’ move y’at em
I’ll take a nigga’s girl pussy, make an Uzi out her
Ah!

(Hook)
Ya know!
(I’m on the Snoop shit, they tryna bring the Boozie out em)
(It ain’t nothin’ but a 187 when I catch ya muthafucka nigga)
Ya know!
(Aight, that’s it! That’s it, cous’! We out, bruh!)
