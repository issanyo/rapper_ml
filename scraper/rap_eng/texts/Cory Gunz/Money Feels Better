Chorus:
Every day I wake up, all I think is make buck
Shawty I would stay but I just gotta get this paper
Had you like "Damn, this the best sex ever"
Your pussy felt good but my money feels better
Your pussy felt good but my money feels better
Yes it felt good but my money feels better
Your pussy felt good but my money feels better
Yes it felt good but my money feels better

Los:
Hey we ballin' like the Final Four
So every night those bottles pour
Hand-stitched Italian decor cover those marble floors
Nothing borrowed my lifestyle is marveled for
Swedish models marvellous newish model Porsche
Wine and cheddar, fine leather, vicious shoes
And that's what calls all the bitches my nigga this is true
They swear the money long and I don't give em shortcake
I'd rather pay a lawyer help my niggas beat a court case
Then paint the old-school Rolls and paint the rows candy
With some arm candy named Rose that's dope as nose candy
So have my dough handy or you can see the exit
I'm bout my money I gets to it like I GPSed it
Please respect it I don't cuff for the homies can holla
The only way I chase pussy if it owe me a dollar
Yeah I'm married to this cash and I'm real committed
So it's money over everything except my will to get it

Chorus

Cory Gunz:
Hey shawty what the biz be
If the money weren't wit me would you miss me
Let a nigga tell it I better be history
Will I ever love her? It's a mystery
Texting me till her hands get blistery
Instantly all she wanna do is miss the meat
She don't wanna cut, she just wanna sense of me, dispose of me
You know, dispense of me
Can't pimp a pimp coincidentally
I'm a running train hit the money mentally
In the park gettin higher than a frisbee gone with the wind
You know where the kid be
Rock star life, with a hot chick
In a rap group, where the pop shit
YMCM with a B later
Till the death I don't know where I'mma be later
No favor, please hater
Keep peeling that cheddar I'm a cheese grater
He dope with his mean fake up
And his queen broke down so she need makeup
Straight smoke when the team wake up
Get the green cake now lean mink up (?)
They down they gon rep they town
Do it like a wet dream with a clean wake up
Los niggas need paid bucks cuz them heat stay close and they need paper
Your seats ain't close like they tryna do the most
To reach they goals but you just ain't us
Well they head ahead if they must
I ain't with the day-to-day fuss
Till the day I lay and they pay respects
Dollar sign Pi, pay my cuts, straight up

Chorus

Los:
Okay I drop her off and then she top me off in that Impala now
All I do is beat that pussy up and chase a dollar down
I might just rip her bras apart let her rip the mall apart
First time she slipped them drawers up off I let her whip the Quattroporte
Getting money different ways
Gripping chips and whipping blades
Tipsy off Patrizzy yeah we mixed it with that lemonade
Yeah I guess them figures made
Swagger on a frightening level
Red bitch on my arm shining like a Breitling bezel
Tell you what we bout to do cop you that Louboutin shoe
My watch look like a frozen Sprite
My chain look like a Mountain Dew
Always dreamed of riding fly
Watching Beemers driving by
Now I'm beamin' riding high
While I'm leaning side to side
See I be making power moves
While you take a power nap
Money power pussy dollars
Don't respect when cowards slackin'
Ain't bout that money? Hollaback
Damn she says she's soaking wet
I'll be thinking 'bout counting money every time I'm stroking that

Chorus
