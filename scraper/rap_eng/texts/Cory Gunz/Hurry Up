[VERSE 1]
When we first met I told myself you were the one
To lay up next to me
Late at night when work was done
You looked into me eyes
How could somethin' so right be wrong?
I gotta find a way to leave him for you

[HOOK 1]
So I start a fight
To get him mad at me
Then we'll be breakin' up... temporarily
That's when I'm callin' you
To head over your house
Baby I love the way you take care of me when you see me down
I love it when you're tellin' me

[Chorus 1]
Hurry up... come quick... I'm here for you
Don't cry baby, he ain't shit
I know what you goin' through
Hurry up... come quick... I'll be waitin' for you
I gotta find a way to leave him for you
Uh uh uh... uh, hurry up
Uh uh uh uh... hurry up

[VERSE 2]
When I lay down at night
Why the hell are you on my mind?
When I'm up next to him?
Maybe 'cuz he don't treat me right
You could be lovin' me
I know he does his thing on the side
Gotta find me a good reason to leave

[HOOK 2]
So I start another fight
To get him mad at me
Then we'll be breakin' up... a good excuse to leave
Oh and that's when I'm callin' you
To head over your house
Baby I love the way you take care of me when you see me down
I love when you're tellin' me

[Chorus 1]
Hurry up... come quick... I'm here for you
Don't cry baby he ain't shit
I know what you're goin' through
Hurry up... come quick... I'll be waitin' for you
I gotta find a way to leave him for you

[Chorus 2]
Hurry up... come quick... He said, "I'll be waitin' for you"
Don't cry baby, he ain't shit
"Baby girl I know what you're goin' through"
Hurry up hurry up come quick
I'll be waitin' for you
I gotta find a way to leave him for you

[Gunz Rap]
I'm ya remedy, ya dozier blunt, ya Don-P
When you met Gunz little man became a memory
I boost ya self-esteem he take ya energy, ma
You might as well hurry on up
'Cuz I'ma burn it on up like ya first time pushin' a clutch
You shake when you see me, shiver when you feel my touch
We both know it's real love but we indulgin' in lust
But for you I'll hurry on up
And run them "8 Miles" and "Lose Myself"
Without you wouldn't know what I would do wit myself
When you with me you comfortable
We can start a family like the Huxtables
For that love from you I would switch like Jeckyl & Hyde
Just give me the word and my henchmen will ride
And I know you not feelin' that he dealin' you lies

[HOOK 2]
So I start another fight
To get him mad at me
Then we'll be breakin' up... a good excuse to leave
Oh and that's when I'm callin' you
To head over your house (your house)
Baby I love the way you take care of me when you see me down
I love when you're tellin' me

[Chorus 1]
Hurry up... come quick... I'm here for you
Don't cry baby, he ain't shit
I know what you goin' through
Hurry up... come quick... I'll be waitin' for you
I gotta find a way to leave him for you

He said, "Whenever you need me
And you stressin' out
Baby here are the keys
Come over my house
I'm here for you girl I don't wanna see you cry
But ya man ain't shit (he ain't shit)
So just tell him goodbye..."
