[Intro]
Momma went and made a thug nigga
And by the grace of god you can die a drug dealer
My soldiers on the grind tryin to climb out the struggle
In time you'll be fine, keep your mind on your hustle

[Verse 1]
Remember back, I was a snot nosed nigga
They told me I was small so I wore my clothes bigger
Alotta homies dead cause they ran with hoe niggas
So I ain't never ran with a hit from no nigga
My soliders 9 to 5 on the block to stay alive
They know they gotta ride, get that rock away or die
Ain't got no peace of mind, all they got is peace of mind
With their pistol by their side, tryin to dodge a homicide
Cause even I ain't tryin to put those tears in mommas eyes
Gramma know I love her and my momma know I try
My grandaddy died 'fore I got to say goodbye
I knew him more than daddy, daddy I ain't gotta lie
My head up to the sky, when I pray at night I cry
And ask father why he even bothered with my life
Cause I ain't here for nothing but the cause of dealin trouble
If you feel me when you hear me then you know
You feel the struggle when we struggle cause...

[Chorus]
Momma went and made a thug nigga
And by the grace of god you can die a drug dealer
My soldiers on the grind tryin to climb out the struggle
In time you'll be fine, keep your mind on your hustle
My soldiers on the grind keep your mind on your hustle
A nigga look you down, try to shine, show you muscle
My soliders on the grind keep your mind on your hustle
In time you'll be fine, you gonna climb out the struggle

[Verse 2]
Remember back, I was a snot nosed nigga
For snack, I put the water in my cheerios nigga
Sugar in my water and a sandwich I was eatin
Showed a lotta niggas wasn't nothin sweet if I was feining
Them suckas up the hill tryed to ride around the block
Tryed to jump us, kept me quiet when we fired random shots
I knew alotta legends that retired on my block
Some niggas turned feds and put wires on my block
But still I'm gonna ride and teein until I die
I rep one-seven-four 'till the choir harmonize
Militia get this money, B-X where I reside
No matter where you bangin, keep your step in solid line
They want us on the corner, shot to death or on that line
You feel me when you hear me, how we really know who liein
Thinkin you ain't here for nothin, but cause of dealin trouble
If you feel me when you hear me
Then you know you feel the struggle
When we struggle cause...

[Chorus]
Momma went and made a thug nigga
And by the grace of god you can die a drug dealer
My soldiers on the grind tryin to climb out the struggle
In time you'll be fine, keep your mind on your hustle
My soldiers on the grind keep your mind on your hustle
A nigga look you down, try to shine, show you muscle
My soliders on the grind keep your mind on your hustle
In time you'll be fine, you gonna climb out the struggle
