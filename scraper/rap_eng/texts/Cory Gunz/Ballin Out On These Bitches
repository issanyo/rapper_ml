Chorus: Cory Gunz & (Charlie Rock)
You know I’m putting my niggas on
You know I’m putting my niggas on
You know I’m putting my niggas on
You know I’m putting my niggas on

I got these young boys, show with it
These young bitches, they get it
I swear I’m never turning lifestyle
Y’all niggas is finished
Trade them other, malicious
Tonight niggas winning
Gripped up, backed out
Balling out on these bitches
Gripped up, backed out
Balling out on these bitches
Gripped up, backed out
Balling out on these bitches
Gripped up, backed out
Balling out on these bitches
Gripped up, backed out
Balling out on these bitches
Balling out on these bitches
Balling out on these bitches
Balling out on these bitches
Balling out on these bitches
Balling out on these bitches

Verse:Cory Gunz
I ain’t with that sucker shit
Y’all be on some other shit
I ain’t ever love a bitch
Till I met my other bitch
Diane will do you dirty
She used to let it grip
Used to hold a nigga drugs and shit
She be on some thugging shit
Smoking with me in public
That’s why I love the bitch
Keep her with me ’cause we love this shit
Throwing Benjies, y’all fuck a bitch

Chorus Cory Gunz & (Charlie Rock)
You know I’m putting my niggas on
You know I’m putting my niggas on
You know I’m putting my niggas on
You know I’m putting my niggas on

(I got these young boys, show with it
These young bitches, they get it
I swear I’m never turning lifestyle
Y’all niggas is finished
Trade them other, malicious
Tonight niggas winning
Gripped up, backed out
Balling out on these bitches
Gripped up, backed out
Balling out on these bitches
Gripped up, backed out
Balling out on these bitches
Gripped up, backed out
Balling out on these bitches
Gripped up, backed out
Balling out on these bitches
Get my whip till I die
Balling out on these bitches
I get money, I get high
Balling out on these bitches
I get ‘ I get fly
Balling out on these bitches
Balling out on these bitches
Balling out on these bitches)

Verse:Cory Gunz
My niggas be running shit
My niggas be gunning shit
I be on my stunting shit
I do all the punishment
You know I’m on the Bronx
Violating nigga’s moms
Tell a sucker nigga off
Fucking like a boss
Clock out when we die
Clock out when we die
Clock out when we die
Knocking niggas off

Chorus: Cory Gunz & (Charlie Rock)
You know I’m putting my niggas on
You know I’m putting my niggas on

I swear I’m never turning lifestyle
Y’all niggas is finished
Trade them other, malicious
Tonight niggas winning
Gripped up, backed out
