[Verse 1: Ben J]
You got that ass clapping, that's a case dance
Like I'm Reginald ladies man!
He came in this bitch looking like a paid man
Threw some money on that pussy, made her rain dance
Pourin out the dankin, got the girls drinking
Girl ask me who I was, bitch I'm famous
Smart bitch need a chick that don't speak no English
Hardcore tied her up, bitch like danger!
She thirsty! She no longer fuck with no rookies
Niggas are mad, but they don't wanna push me
Party over here, let your fools take my groupies
I'm fucking with these blind bitches and then he brought Snooki
I Jersey shore all these whores like the nest

Separate me from rest, fully gang bang, then I DNG to the next!

[Hook: Ben J]
Ain't no playing hard to get girl

Drop it down to the floor and pick it back up
Racks in my pocket, I'm a live it up!
Rain dance, rain dance
Fuckin with a nigga, who don't give a fuck
Rain dance, rain dance
Stacks on the floor, girl pick it up

[Verse 2: Legacy]
Fully click, got her on that groupie shit
She don't really rap much, but I see the coochie spit
Club couch got them whoopy stains
Rain dancing in the pussy and it made the pussy rain
Keepin it G like two bops vegetarians, bop loading like they full hot
Them hoes always pop up but with you, they never with it
I be on my homer shit always fucking yellow bitches
Seen her, barely need to meet her poppin Miley, Now she rollin on the wood
Atleast it steam her, steam her hot bust a new whip, pulled out that good zip
Light a fire in the tent smoky in the wood's pits
Sour ain't as sweet but it ain't contradicting
Stripping that ass, why that ass ain't evicted

Fuckin with the foolies and her ass got rich

[Hook: Ben J]
Ain't no playing hard to get girl
What's up?

Feelin beams in the P.M. but I cat kitty
Except to me I let you see'em if she act shitty
Hypnotize her with the ring until she act dizzy
