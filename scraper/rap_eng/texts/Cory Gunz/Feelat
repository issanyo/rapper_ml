[Hook : Cory Gunz]
Touching them bills
Bad ass bitch I fuck in them heels
Got my couple blunt and I'm chill
Stunting I'm still fuck what y'all feel

[Verse 1 : Cory Gunz]
Feelat, I'm hood rich, feelat, I don't talk shit, feelat
I run shit, feelat, I fucked your bitch Feelat
Stack that bread, feelat, straps on deck, feelat
Fuck y'all say, feelat, she bust my head, feelat
I don't feel shit, feelat, I feel your bitch, feelat
Smoke, syrup, activist, I be sipping that shit, feelat
I'm about racks, feelat, you niggas don't trap, feelat
You niggas sell rap, feelat, my niggas sell crack, Feelat
Five for the 40, deal that, riding slowly, wheel that
Fight at your homie, kill that, young and let your hood right, feelat
I'm looking for a place, you're right, I punch you in the face, feelat
I cut you in the face like. What the fuck you gotta say? Spill that
Me? Stop, never, go away, when I die fucking till late
Young money, cash money, militia, bitch, nigga, feelat
I be doing me, feelat, she be doing me, feelat
We play catch, we play catch, she throw that ass back like feelat
Feelat, feelat, feelat, (ya hear me?) feelat

[Verse 2 : Mack Maine]
Real nigga and his bitch, feelat, 40 K on my wrist, feelat
Got a bitch that don't like to suck dick but she always tryina take a trip, feelat
I always tell a bitch no, feelat, no, bitch, you can't go, feelat
You ain't my girl, you ain't my bitch, you ain't my ho, feelat
Right where you talk is where you get killed at
But none in here, nigga gets your shit pealed back
It'll be a minute for your body parts heal back
Pimp C, Bun B, what a trill at
When broke niggas come around we don't feelat
A bitch with a funky pussy, we don't feelat
We the vets, we the richest, we don't feelat
If you don't feel this, we'll make you feelat
That, that, brrr, stick up, you call out for help but ain't nobody there to pick up
Shot to your body, Pilates, sit ups, cut your legs off lil' boy, now get up
Feelat, nigga, I know you can't feel that
Ace school, real with shit here
The realest niggas in the game but still there
The chauffeur in the front and I'm in the back
No dyke but my nigga, I'm strapped
Put me on the globe, put me on the map
Paraplegic flow
The chauffeur in the front and I'm in the back
No dyke but my nigga, I'm strapped
Put me on the globe, put me on the map
Paraplegic flow

[Hook : Cory Gunz] x2
Feelat, touching them bills, bad ass bitch I fuck in them heels
Got my couple blunt and I'm chill
Stunting, I'm still, fuck what y'all feel

[Outro : Cory Gunz]
Feelat, feelat, feelat, feelat, feelat
Feelat, feelat, feelat, feelat
