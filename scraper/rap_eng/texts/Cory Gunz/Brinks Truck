Yeah I love money I love hoes
I cuff money I never cuff hoes
Middle finger to you hatin ass niggas
Y'all should retire Gary Payton ass niggas
Steady worrying about the hoes I put my balls in
Cause it might be a bitch you callin darling
And it hurts that you might see me live at the Garden
And I'm on the floor while Melo on the floor and just like I'm a balling
And I talk expensive so I drop 20 bands on my grill
Money ain't a thing it never been a thing
So I wipe my ass with hundred dollars bills
Told y'all niggas I'm the hottest in the hood
Got it by the O and I got it for the good
Niggas better know when they come to my town
That it comes to see me when it comes to my hood
Doin my thing they can't ruin my thing
Tip toe down they ain't moving my thing
Pussy get close then im shooting my thing
Give a man soft, sucka might sing
Back em all down sit em all up
Tell the paramedics come pick em all up
If a nigga move then we hit them all up
If they ever need work tell them niggas call us
Shake down, shake down
For that money leave a fucker face down
Yeah

I love money I love hoes
I cuff money I never cuff hoes
I got that money comin in the brinks truck
I'm high 'bove the clouds with the wheels up
I love money I love hoes
I cuff money I never cuff hoes
I got that money comin in the brinks truck
I'm high 'bove the clouds with the wheels up

Young money, cash money
To my last money you can bet ya ass honey
Milita full of shooters who'll blast for me
Make a movie put your body in cast for me
I'm usually not a dick but you niggas ass to me
Clips pop in the whip quick shots in a flash for me
Hot chicks in the mix with the piff got the bics and the clips is a stash for me
Police know my name they be askin hash for me
So when I'm on my stroll and I dont go slow
On the flo' I roll got fo or five toasts' and they all poke holes
For the dough I go still dont overload bought fo' or five ghosts
Gotta all gold phone and im blowin my smoke get the ozone torne
Let go of my loaf 'for your whole throats shown
But I'm for my own so I [?]
Any nigga sweet? Hows taffay? I'll paint a niggas street red like cafe
When I'm aiming with the heat, jam stop that K?
To all my favorite things, that drop, that tre
Nigga stop that talk, bitch type shit, all my niggas in the rain, they gone leave em like this
But if I dont like that nigga, then like (frrip frrip) causing all kinda catastrophic shit
YMCMB hero, bitch I'mma x-man gimme cerebral bitch
My left hand should be illegal bitch
