"I Try"
(feat. Sean Hayz)

[Bridge:]
Father, I wish I coulda been a better son but I try
Girl, I wish I coulda been a better man but I try
I coulda been a better dad but I try
I'm sorry I couldn't be what ya'll expect but I try

[Verse 1:]
Stride in the gled, they need a man who came with a fam and they dramas
And I must provide and protect
Funny how time flies, you get old and you wise
Ain't no winning for losing, witness to show if you kind
Either they love it or they broke the feeling
Lose against life, you can feel or hear it, they'll never kill my spirit
Since 13, 8th grade, middle school
I started writing my own shit and they riddle cool
All of a sudden all I wanted to ridicule
Gave me attention, that's when the bitches did it too
Family, spit what I did and what I would do
Family, writing his shit was all I could do
Heartbroken, child trauma, wild mama
Fowl drama, now karma, feel karma
Huh? Got me thinking bout the wonder years
When I lived to rap, now it's like I rap to live

[Hook:]
I know I ain't the best but I try, yea
I know I ain't the best but I try
I wish I could be a better son (better son)
I wish I could be a better man (a better man)
Wish I could be a better dad (a better dad)
Sorry I couldn't be what ya'll expect though I try

[Verse 2:]
Me and my pops were Starsky and Hutch
I don't know what I did but I know now he don't talk to me much
He wonder why I be sparking it up
Fearing that I'll kill my inspiration, like I can't record with a dutch
Now we talk in texts
Fuck is this? I thought we was us
Where you at? They suportin my crutch
That type of shit will get Cory the clutch
Make me go in my cage, set up a wall, there's nowhere to touch
Blaming myself, all I did was followed your steps
Had to follow my own, wouldn't follow regret
My daughter's mom drop me to death
She could fuck who she wants, around my kids I won't accept
Thinkin back, thinkin back like I shoulda cut school like they in on too
I wouldn't have did this man
No buzz to follow, no deals to follow him with that
No snakes, a time that ho bitch tryin to fix a trap
Yo friends back at the 20's tryin to fix a flat
That was life at it's best, what I would give for that?
I see em, they ain't giving what you rap
How you use it just to give it back
Fuck it

[Hook:]
I know I ain't the best but I try, yea
I know I ain't the best but I try
I wish I could be a better son (better son)
I wish I could be a better man (a better man)
Wish I could be a better dad (a better dad)
Sorry I couldn't be what ya'll expect though I try

I try...

I know I ain't the best but I try
I know I ain't the best but I try try
A better son, a better man
A better dad
Oh I... I try
