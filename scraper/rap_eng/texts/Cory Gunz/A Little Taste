Uh, shut the fuck up and pay attention
Clowns loud, talk to much, I hope your listening
Now, take your foot out chya' mouth
My fist is in, baby tell me how does it taste
I hope your listenin'
Uh, shut the fuck up and pay attention
Clowns loud, talk to much, I hope your listening
Now, take your foot out chya' mouth
My fist is in, baby tell me how does it taste
I hope your listenin'

[Verse]
Cory Gunz in this bitch like where the euros at
And Cory Gunz in this bitch like where the euros at
So fly, as the shit I get to give 'em that
Lead clap, knocking your whip, making your mirror crack
Pause
Don't it sound like I got my bearings back?
Sorry my younger audience, y'all if you're hearing that
Rap artists show me your heart, bitch if your wearing that
Be yourself, whatever, thought they'd let me, look who's here, I'm back
Weezy
Found all my problems sound, I'm hearin' that
'Case a fake nigga fazed, they come to me swearin' that
We should do a track but Mac Mizzle ain't clearin' that
And my Poppa Gat, and Shaq Dizzle ain't hearin that
Young
Money, I'm 'bout to pull a Pullitzer
Anybody here to show Gunz who to put the bullets on
Hot shit, dead at ya chest sucka, so suck it up
Bout to turn the tables, you other labels is fuckin up
Up

[Hook}
Uh, shut the fuck up and pay attention
Clowns loud, talk to much, I hope your listening
Now, take your foot out chya' mouth
My fist is in, baby tell me how does it taste
I hope your listenin'
Uh, shut the fuck up and pay attention
Clowns loud, talk to much, I hope your listening
Now, take your foot out chya' mouth
My fist is in, baby tell me, how's it taste?
