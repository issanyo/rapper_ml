[Intro]
Bone

C-U-K

Rock with me

Aye

[Bridge]
What you tryna get into
Girl you need to come through
What you tryna get into
You need to bring your friends too

[Hook: Jordan Hunter]
Talking like you 'bout it, I ain't seeing nothing though (nah)
I really want to see if you really tryna go
Yea you talking like you 'bout it I ain't seeing nothing though (no)
I really want to know if you really tryna go

[Verse 1: Jordan Hunter]
Yo, my flow hard and pardon, I'm Jordan
I cop shit, then I rocket like James Harden
A lot of niggas saying they ball, but who's starting
I ain't ball hogging, freaks, I'm point-guarding
I'm on a different level and I'm cooking it up
Hooking it up, what up, with my drink in my cup
But, if she's in town, it's going down, I ain't playing around
Then I pound, until them neighbors tell me simmer down
I like to freak with a freak and give her weak legs
I hit it deep and give her meat like crab legs
Pretty clear I won't stop and I can't stop
I bend her over then I beater like a tank-top
You know how that go (go)
Or maybe you don't (don't)
I want my pockets real thick like Raven-Symon√©
They done got on third base, but I'm taking it home
The way your boo scream, you'd think that I'm breaking her bones

[Hook: Jordan Hunter]

[Verse: Cory Gunz]
Find me and my niggas riding out on the set
They don't try it cause my niggas wil'n out for respect
Got them blockas, I can tear a nigga mouth with his neck
Stacking dollars, I'ma get it 'til I'm out of my breath
I ain't far or hard to find I'm prolly right on the block
Grab a nigga by the legs, treat him like he a mop
Love them automatics or the heater might be a Glock
Shorty bad, her friend better, then she might see the cock
Rolling dolo, riding dirty so we might flee the cops
Hit the phone, around like 30 before I leave the spot
R.I.P. to all my niggas yo I miss Peedi Pop
Break my foot off in your wife, treat her like she a sock
Don't hardly think you chilling cause I might see the drop
Niggas cyber thugging like they gone skype me the shots
None you pussy niggas ever fucking mattered to me
All I need is Militia Gang and YMCMB, peace

[Verse 2: Jordan Hunter]
I'm smoking green, and fidgeting, with a drama queen
The way lil mama scream, she gone cause a scene, it's sickening
You listening, equipped with things that'll make her feen
And make her cream, we making movies full of naughty scenes
Bending them women and swimming in them, it's a given
Listen, her head's back and forth, now that's repetition
Before her head was going south like a palm tree
Them back shots had her looking like she couldn't breathe

[Bridge]
