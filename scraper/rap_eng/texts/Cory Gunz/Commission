[Chorus: Neek Bucks]
If you ain't one of mine, I ain't fuckin' with you niggas
I'm still posted in the trenches with the drip that's sendin' hitters
Not to mention my niggas been in commission for a minute
Talkin' bread was your intentions
You ain't gang, you ain't my nigga
Talkin' 'bout touchin' mine like, "Pull the trigger, that boy finished"
If you tuck in my trill, that boy a million dollar nigga
Yeah, we still in the field, a nigga playin', we gon' hit 'em
Them my niggas for real
Yeah, H4 we in the building
Lot of gang shit, gang

[Verse 1: Neek Bucks]
I will never testify
How the fuck am I gon' ever look my brothers in the eye?
And they got my lil' nigga, I'm screamin' "fuck the other side"
Still a nigga momma cry
I been dreamin' homicide
Get some work and hit the road
It's so much love for my niggas
That nigga Banko killed like 50 since he touched, that's my nigga
And I'm involved in any tension that's involvin' my niggas
When they was broke, shit, I was broke
And I was starvin' right with 'em
Lot of gang shit
Kinda far ahead from all the shit that you on
Just been jumpin' out that foreign in that new Saint Laurent
And got your bitch all on my dick, I asked her what shoes she want
I gotta do it 'cause these niggas want me broke and not on
I gotta ball, baby
No foldin' up, I'm standin' tall, baby
We left them out, we brought the small 80
Ay, fuck them bitches, dog, they all shady
Gang
A lot of gang shit
All this sucker shit, I just been standin' above
Different bucket 'round this time, shit, we ain't showin' no love
Spent some time away from the homies, I been focusin' up
And got some bitches in the [?] talkin' 'bout openin' up

[Chorus: Neek Bucks]
If you ain't one of mine, I ain't fuckin' with you niggas
I'm still posted in the trenches with the drip that's sendin' hitters
Not to mention my niggas been in commission for a minute
Talkin' bread was your intentions
You ain't gang, you ain't my nigga
Talkin' 'bout touchin' mine like, "Pull the trigger, that boy finished"
If you tuck in my trill, that boy a million dollar nigga
Yeah, we still in the field, a nigga playin', we gon' hit 'em
Them my niggas for real
Yeah, H4 we in the building
Lot of gang shit

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]


[Chorus: Neek Bucks]
If you ain't one of mine, I ain't fuckin' with you niggas
I'm still posted in the trenches with the drip that's sendin' hitters
Not to mention my niggas been in commission for a minute
Talkin' bread was your intentions
You ain't gang, you ain't my nigga
Talkin' 'bout touchin' mine like, "Pull the trigger, that boy finished"
If you tuck in my trill, that boy a million dollar nigga
Yeah, we still in the field, a nigga playin', we gon' hit 'em
Them my niggas for real
Yeah, H4 we in the building
Lot of gang shit
