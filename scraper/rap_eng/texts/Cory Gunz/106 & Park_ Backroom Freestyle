Yo, what have they locked me in?
Why is It dark in here, what if they box me in?
My clothes looks like it's my blood they washed me in
Somebody else was bound when they locked me in
Maybe I should'nt talk when I'm feeling saussy then
Maybe I Probably wouldn't be an hostage then
My chest feels like one million man stomped it in
Scretchy noise like rats Scratching a coffee tin
Where my at? I'm trying to see where it all begin
By then, but then it was too late to all be friends
Foreign scientist papers all be bin
When the semi spin twenty tens at your ginni gins
The M is what im rippin my men's march we in
We always down to rock n roll like R.E.M
The shots, we take em but we let yall keep em
F with the malicia let the count off begin
Like one phone call to my goons
Everybody in your living room
Politic is (wunch)?
Ch ch on my shh
I'll be having everybody on your corner run
Hold up
What have they washed me at
Ironicly chronicly by the laundry mat
With the crackhead and cokehead and dopehead and (go to that)
Before i pick up a squeege i'll be beating...
Like trickyti clickety wapapati papati blat
Now can you realisticly rap and gaffle me that
F a salary cap when you F-ing cavities capped
Over a salary cap and the status for your battery pack
Im sayin
Overreacting I make a movie dramatic
Addict for chicken developing lucys habit
I'm a walking groupie magnet with a snoopybag of goofy gadgets
And a pack of short new ports for my lucy addicts
Pop first and apologies last
Pounds before my proctology up your aunti's ass
Perhaps, maybe this isn't how sick it gets
I was born backward quick when I spit I shit, fuckaa

BET i luv yaa
