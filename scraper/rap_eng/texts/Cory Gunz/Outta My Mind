[Refrain]
Outta my mind, (so sick) I'm outta my mind

[Verse 1]
Wait, take a second to respect the perspective
My whole perceptions the method: expect the unexpected
Poverty stricken naked
Non-believers can guess it
Second they on they knees and get necking off on me till they strepted
Weapon, hand the debit
Web it, man and kept it
Separate van, and spread it, slit his man, and wet his fam, intrepid
F-it, catch it, wretched, sketch it, fetch it, sketch it
I'm a Liar Liar with the mask fuck a Pet Detective
Losing my cup of noodles, temper tantrums get brutal
In the mood to pull out an uzi on a fuckin' poodle
Cameras watching me like I'm something to do
Now they get it, admit
So I'm spitting that shit, stick your tongue in doo-doo
Like my life and career's been under voodoo
I broke the hex, and wrote the checks
The coke connect should think I'm bluffing google-me
Ho-hold, no hamo, how humble I can be
I been watching MTV all my life, now MTV watching me
See, nobody knows what went wrong with me
Somebody tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
This isn't the life I was born to see
What the fuck is wrong with me

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
What the what went wrong with me
Mommy why you stop calling me
Why these police keep walling me
Why these bitches keep stalling me
When ain't nothing gonna follow me
Where the fuck's my apology
For putting me through such awkward psychology
Wasn't for grandma I'd be dumb and dead
Ha, light and skinny onion head
Wanna keep me fed till her bunions bled
Sweetest, I'm cheated and treated like I'm under dead
Spit on after shit on, till I'm hit on, I want the meds
And all they hear is some addict a functioning junkie
Maybe not, cause I grew with thoughts that no mother would want me
Maybe not, cause I watched them abused the drugs right in front of me
Couple pills ain't gonna kill me
Couple blunts ain't gonna hunt me
Couple cups ain't gonna fill me
Couple chumps ain't gonna chill me
Now I'm stuck to get bucked for these couple bucks, you feel me
The only couple for me, Madison and McKenzie
Pay me, fuck a relationship lady let me get busy
Shit
Nobody knows what went wrong with me
Somebody tell me what the fuck when wrong with me
This isn't the life I was born to see
What the fuck is wrong with me (with me)
