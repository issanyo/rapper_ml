[Verse 1: Ceza]
Sen kalk, bir minik mikrofonunu getir
Bak jak burada diktafonuna tak
Kağıt kalem bir de ilham alınacak
Tam gaz choppers, havada düşman avına çıkalım
Akalım, haydi bu battle'ı kazanalım

[Intro]
We started in the Midwest
Now we 'bout to take it
All over the world, baby
This is the pinnacle
Yeah, Tech N9ne

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Follow me, all around the planet, I run the gamut on Sickology
They could never manage, we do damage with no apology
Pick 'em out the panic, a little manic cause I gotta be
Frantic, I’ma jam it cause I'm an oddity
Gobble the track up like I'm grubbin' at Mama Nakas
I can pop at you proper cause I’m partners with Waka Flocka
Give me the top of hip-hop and watch him make 'em rock
With a show-stopper, chakras popping off the (Worldwide Choppers)
If you anybody, you notice it
Tech is the pinnacle, not an identical soul is it
Loaded cold as the polar get wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo it exploded the flow behold it cause when the motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a, never to get free of the real
Better ya just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Give me the knock and I’ma chop, he came and he went tomorrow
But I’ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas
Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trip when I rip it up, I be the ish when I split em up
Sort of like I was liquored up and backing up in the gut
Everybody be knowing I be acting up when I bust
From Missouri to Canada, I be keeping the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man, the planet's unanimous
Can I cuss, fuck anybody Tech is calamitous
Leave them in the dust, ain't nobody tough when I'm standing up
Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinking he give it the Poe and toss in Picasso
Killing everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the coffin when I go

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

(K.C.)
[Verse 3: J.L.]
Check it, I'm ahead of 'em
Chop it up with the veterans
A legend developing
Ain't gotta tell him it's evident
Gotta notice an elephant
None of you niggas relevant
You're delicate, but loving every second of this

(Denmark)
[Verse 4: U$o]
De vil alle tjekke når vi ligger det
Kommer ind og smækker det beatet jeg vækker det
I ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
Hanger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle vild "Fucking Chopper"

(Alabama)
[Verse 5: Yelawolf]
What if I ran into you with a pogo stick
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness
With a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more churches like I was playing Hamlet
Syllable burning, that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree, like I was peeling pecans
But instead, I'm peeling rappers' heads, making a sand-a-wich
Pick up a 22 and put a bullet inside of a
Motherfucka from inside a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make them feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
But I hopped on the fucking beat
And I worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne
Twist up the pine and
Smoke a beat with Mr. Busta Rhymes
Well, sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
Wit' an alien probe

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

Twista (Chicago)
[Verse 6: Twista]
Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
And hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
And then I'mma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies cause of cannibalism
Breaking them off into particles, they get in a predicament
That be never reversible cause a nigga be too versatile
Makin' you nervous, you could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then your respect I better have
Because I'm an anomaly, then I'mma give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challenging my astronomy
Hopping, I don’t stop with the fire when the flames thrown
I'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwing it up in the air, takin' it there
We WWC, if you can't keep up, should've stayed home
My alien knowledge be making other astronomers'
Work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology
So play me and I'mma be shining on them haters
I'm finna be using it as energy, watch how radiant I'mma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If I catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
Don't even try to stop us cause we choppers and we worldwide
And I'm

(New York)
[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
See, now they ask when I'mma stop it, my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it, and when I'ma drop it my dude
Inevitably, it's that I'mma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask “what in the world is you proving
Wh-when you were already the best” and “what the hell is he doing”
Well, I'ma be chopping and cutting and breaking and beating and shaking
And fucking everything up 'til I make no further mistake and
Busting everything up like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
And shutting everything up, especially the ones who be hating
They loving everything until I got 'em stuttering-stupid
You hear 'em now?
“D-d-d-d-don’t do-do-do-do it
P-P-P-Please
Wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest”
And now I'mma come and kill 'em, get them, hit them, and finish them
And bang 'em in the head and diminish them, and then I'll
Hit 'em again at a minimum, repeat it coming to killing 'em
Then he be gotta be drilling them
Thinking “they gotta be feeling him”
Spitting lithium, see the way a nigga be spilling them
And getting them stupid to the point where there's no forgiving him
Hoping you're listening and you're paying attention
And you're witnessing the way that I be christening in the mic
And getting in the zone, I be flattening and packing in
People from the front to the back and
They got me acting a fool, I'm Black and
Nigga now I’m home

[Verse 8: D-Loc]
My fire annihilate make fighters retire instantly
I’m choppin' ‘em, call me Michael Myers in my vicinity
The way I be killing 'em with rhythm, it get illegitimate
The Gilla will finish any, in a predicament
Any enemies in the vicinity, I gotta mack up
They know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
The history of a lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals
Check my resume, they said the Gillgod’s biblical

(California)
[Verse 9: Twisted Insane]
I hit 'em with venom when I get up in 'em
I bend em and send em and you can feel me
Digging up in your brain and bringing the pain
They often wanna kill me
Filling 'em with that fury
Get up and hurry, you can feel the Real me
Coming up with that shit, I'm having a fit, and you will never peel me
Off of you when I'm on top of you, I got the drop on you
And popping often hit ‘em up with a bullet to the (brain)
You can look into the eyes of a heathen, breathing, you’re fiending
And dreaming to find a demon, name insane, I’m a worldwide (Chopper)

[Verse 10: Eminem]
Me and Yelawolf
Tear the roof off this motherfucker
You ain't got the umph
You're a hoof to the foot of an elephant
Hello toots, you look so eloquent
That's what I tell a cunt
Come sit up front cause you're kicking my seat
And I'm trying to tell the cashier what I want
They say I act like an asshole
When I pull up at the White Castle
And I ask for an appli-cation
Throw it back in her face and
Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her
In the head with a Whopper
That I bought from BK, you expect me to be proper
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately slut, ho
Skidda dee da da
Prada, not a chance
I was thinking about buying you some clothes
But Target's closed
So I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart but the doors
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought
Great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what'dya know
They didn't carry a size eight in hoes
Oh, this is ugly boy swag
Putting toe tags on you motherfucking ho bags
What a Trailer Trash pioneer
I am yeah, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarrhea

(Miami)
[Verse 11: Wrekonize]
It's.. that.. son of a stranger
With a tongue to mud the muck 'em for the dummies in dazes
I've been fuckin' up the suckas with no rubbers and razors
Gettin' lucky with lazors
¡MAYDAY! but I've been tellin' ya that nothing will save ya
I'm an animal, cannibal, I'll battle you and abandon you
I'm comin to damage you but damnit I need an avenue
This shit's, gotta be on some misfit, gotta be fuckin' bisquik
Bringin it back to bump it up and break backs
Shame that they didn't create class
Came up to the wrong math
Show me the late pass
She a tech head and she packin' a great ass
Bout to cloud it up but I'm seen out the stain glass
Killer for cinema
And I'm feeling the end of the
Get a little and give it up
I'mma winner I did it up
I'mma change up turn the shit around to blame ya
Cuz you're momma always told ya never talk to strangers!
But I've been walking with a world war way back
And mashin' up the worst I make em all go play back
They better stop me now before I go all a-crap
And make ya dig deeper for the sounds on a dad
A mini epiphany while I'm bringing the energy
Came to fame or pain got to be give me the remedy
It is insane the lane will
Be killin' the industry
Let me contain your dame while we drill the divinity
I'm a rip it up and let em say they grind
Then again I probably shouldn't save they kind
Let 'em all die and never pay they mind
Put 'em in the ground while they tryna lay they lines
Give me a second to sever the 77th amendment and I'll be workin
Wrek up an 8 or 9
Push this motherfucker back into the heyday time
Alot of motherfuckers mad now that iMAYDAY!'s signed sayin'

[Verse 12: Krizz Kaliko]
Nobody can catch him he the Speedy Gonzales
The beat is a problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I’ve got to audibly body them
This is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain’t ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
(Then I let 'em melt)
They never heard of us, but look at 'em turnin' up
I slap the shirt off a super simpleton makin ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flippin', niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I’m living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast or I'll smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'ma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I'm rubberized?

(Pennsylvania)
[Verse 13: Rittz]
I am a real Slumerican
Told Yelawolf he can swear me in
I got a heavy double barrel in my box Chevy
When my album drop, everybody scared again
And I’m prepared to win at all costs
Y’all talk a lot of shit, trying to tear my skin
And rumor has it I’m crazy, I need to see a therapist
Well if the shoe fits, fuck it I'mma wear it then
Cause I’m a go getter, other squares pretend
I’m bout to turn up like a sombrero brim
I'm kinda like a modern day Larry Flynt
It’s Slum shit, baby fuck Katy Perry fans
I rep Atlanta, I ain’t never been to Paris, France
I switch lanes, crossing over like I’m Jeremy Lin
You can admire me, don’t let me catch you staring pimp
I’m like a great white shark in this aquarium
When I was young, ain't no kids out caroling
Around the holidays, they were pistol carrying
In despair, getting paper was imperative
I'm reaching in my pocket, only thing there was lint
With lack of parentin', no one to spare a cent
We suited up in all black and a pair of timbs

(New York)
{Verse 14: Cory Gunz]
Marchin' like a martian, hit the starship with the carbon, I'm a marksman
Pewm
Verse for verse, I walk in and chalk men, with the words I'm cursed as cartman
South of the Bronx, the worst department
Swim in the mouth of the swamps, the skirts and garments
Withdrawn in my mental safe in a case to say
I don't think my mental's safe
But I'm sayin' the date issued on the pistols great
Than late crystal wanna be in crystal lake
With a straight pitbull that run a cripple straight
Trynna run a pencil straight through ya stenciled face
I ain't on planes when I swarm fans
And my vains hangin' on vains when I'm on xans
No one in a guinea pants by ya grown man
Stan hands full of strands when I'm on grams
Can somebody tell me somethin'
I know they hear me comin like a copper go and rob an eltiudi
Livin life illegal like it's legal
I gotta carry somethin' till the beta cops catch and tell me nothin'
Cut and get the ropes, I'm a ropesmith
I grew up with the skin of soapdishes if we gotta get it bubbly
Scape snakes wild try, pray the table mine, sound like dubbly
The issue we get speeder
Cuz the militia leader, little peter, got a millimeter heater, and a kilometer rita
See to me you niggas sweeter than a rita, pretty nita, you kilometer rita, I'm an animal Vegeta
Man, she peter, so I eat her when I beat her, she be hangin' of the shoulders of my beater
I be bangin off the meter
Put under the blanky with a yankee get a spanky from the panky like he Jeter
Ha
Drive by nine niggas in the five-seater, lettin' mind fly, blind side leave ya wife beat up
In the mind guys die try to get like me
But my design can fine line any type seater
I'm Re'd up
Kiddy pull the beat up, it's small, I ain't gotta pull my seat up
I'm G'd up

Killin' em like a kid.. got a Kilogram of Ketamine for Kwanza
Knit a Kimono made of Komodo Dragon skin
I'm rich like a Klingon that be kicking it at the Kremlin
But I'm kicking through your door, call me Kramer Kardashian
Lethal, Literally litter a little limerick
That be littler than a Leprechaun
A menace that'll manifest the melancholy mayhem
Makin a metamorphosis until I'm mechanized like Megatron
Nick Nolte: a nerdy native of Nebraska
Needs a neon ninja and a nectarine from NASA
Ominously, I mean it's obvious you see a:
Orthodontist oozing out oodles of onomatopoeia
Oswalt: Patton
Pickin a pocket pluckin a patent
I pickle purple poop in Patron for pure passion
I got a question, I gotta quiz ya'
Lets step on the gas and go quicker
Really getting ready for the revolution
Reeled a rotten rhythm ring around a Russia Ronda Rousey resort
Serve a simple sentiment a simile that's smokin
Like a sheet of Sudafed i'm swiftly swimming like a seahorse
Titties on Atilla Tell a teller that'll toe tag
Terminator gun inside a turtle tattered tote bag
Thugs are un-american unattractive and unwanted as an ugly pair of ugg's
Vivid and vivaciously venomous
With the wicked wombats only walking where women is
Gettin xenophobic at the Xanadu
XoXo
Yippy-ki-yay,!
Yours' Truly

YES YO!!!

[Verse 16: Ludacris]
Ludacris goin in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up, get 'em in the sky
For the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down
I never went nowhere, but they sayin' "Luda's back"
Blame it on that conjure, the hood call it Luda 'gnac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down, like strippers' booties go
My verses still be servin, tight like a million virgins
Last time on the Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out, y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in

Imma eastside Cleveland wild boy, eastside Cleveland wild boy
We got baseball bats like the Indians, and my team pop off like Cowboys
You a "white-flag, throw-that-towel" boy Imma "jump-right-in-that-crowd" boy
You a "shhh, keep-it-down" boy, and Imma "fuck-you, blow-that-loud" boy
All I know is how to kill everyone of my cells
All they know is they can kill anybody but Kells
I am untouchable, you would think I was in jail
But I'm in Mexico getting marijuana from Miguel
Bring it back into the States, put it on a scale
Measure it at half a eighth, put it in a shell
Split it then I roll it, then light it up like it's Independence Day I got a bottle rocket, put it in the air
Snapback with my city on it
Text back with your titties on it
Levi's, put your kitty on it
Start grindin' like the Clipse is on it
Drink it 'til I get pissy, biatch
Smoke it 'til I get dizzy, biatch
Lose Control like Missy, but Imma Bad Boy cause I'm with Diddy, bitch!

[Verse 18: Krayzie Bone]
What a minute, you probably thought I was finished
With me it’s never an ending
The killer make sure you stay dead
This killer flow that be the gimmick
The illest of any minute
The realest, so many feel it
The lyrics really authentic
So potent that when you get it, you cough or choke when you hear it
Im knowing them niggas fearing, cus i got up in their spirit
I told them niggas in the beginning that Imma kill'em with 2000 words in 2 minutes (PIN IT)
Who that nigga running with the AK-47 packing pumps like it fit through us and 357
HEAT, so heated heavy that these competitors are never ready
Im like a disease, I keep spreading
