[Verse 1: APACHE]
I got that scope on my AR
Fast like a jaguar
Opps on my radar
Thrash like slayer
Vest made of Kevlar
You a waste of space bra
Jacket out of leather
Looking like a beggar

Murder is my only thought
Hit you with the killshot
Get some rope and tie a knot
Then I fuck another thot

'Cause I'm a fucking maniac
Aiming at your fucking neck
Shooting mags out of my tec
Then I'm balling like I'm sheck

My weapons biotech
Sipping triple sec
Don't give a fuck bout gangs aye
My weapons biotech
Sipping triple sec
Don't give a fuck bout gangs aye

[Verse 2: DEPTH STRIDA]
Omen thunder God Fist
Devil gene my blood i'm toxic
Swinging lightnings through the sonic
Mishimas are catastrophic

Death is lurkin' in the shadows
I feel like I decompose
Bury me like pharaohs
I'm a god you are too close

Stridin' thru depths i'm the man ay
Bruisin' the bitches to death ay
Put you to sleep like some xans ay
Bury you next to your friends ay

Bitch I still feel like Apache
I got shooters they go nasty
For a coin to feed their family
So they rip your spine casually
20 clips run a ralley
Drill your head paint the valley
Our quest - mercenaries

K9 by my side
War dogs off the leash
Your life on the line
No odds for prestige
K9 by my side
War dogs off the leash
Your life on the line
