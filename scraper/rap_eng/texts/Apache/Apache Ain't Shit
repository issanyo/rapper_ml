[Chorus: Apache]
(Apache you ain't shit!) That's what they're sayin G
(Apache you ain't shit!) But there's no playin me
(Apache you ain't shit!) So fuckin what?
(Apache you ain't shit!) J drop a cut

[Apache]
Yo I ain't shit, won't be shit, won't quit
Quick, here comes a catchy Apache with a long dick
I can't believe you think somethin's up my sleeve
Cause I'll fuck, give you a buck, then tell you to leave
Get real, fuck how you feel, smile don't pout
I'm done hon, you came twice, now get the fuck out
I waited a long time to getcha
Let the doorknob hitcha, where the good lord splitcha
Back in the days you tried to get me now I'm gettin you
That's reason one-two, ain't shit else to do
A man, with a plan and the know-how
Not lookin for Mrs. Right, lookin for Mrs. Right Now
Get your coat deep throat and get Swayze
I'm out to get back anybody who plays me
Don't try to flip, button up your lip
Hell yeah I'm on that tip - and I ain't shit

[Chorus: Apache]
(Apache you ain't shit!) That's what they're sayin G
(Apache you ain't shit!) So what you playin me?
(Apache you ain't shit!) So fuckin what?
(Apache you ain't shit!) J drop the cut

[Apache]
Come have dinner with a winner don't worry about the price
Just kiddin - I wouldn't buy you a fuckin slice
I ain't shit dear, beware, ask me if I care
Fuck callin you a cab; here's your bus fare
Don't ask me to bring your shit, cause I don't deliver
And give me my shit back, I'm in indian giver
If there's money to be made then I'll make it
I did you like I did you cause I thought you could take it
Come come get with it, g'head admit it
You heard I wasn't shit and still let me hit it
Tried to trap me like Tyson, a damn shame
I put a hit on everybody with the same name
I'm on the move, no time to wine and dine a hoe
It's not hard for me to love 'em and let 'em go
Just let me hit the hips, fuck the friendships
I'm on that tip - cause I ain't shit!

[Chorus: Apache]
(Apache you ain't shit!) That's what they're sayin G
(Apache you ain't shit!) So what you playin me?
(Apache you ain't shit!) So fuckin what?
(Apache you ain't shit!) J drop a cut

[Apache]
I'm a man without morals, so don't bet me
I'll fuck my girl's best friend if she lets me
Better yet, don't let me forget the past
Stick around and get a bone kicked out your ass
Speakin of asses, I'm an ass man, lay down
Got a four inch dick and that's from the ground
Cuties pursue me to do me, I dodge 'em
Or find 'em, freak 'em, fuck 'em then rob 'em
Since I can't live without 'em let's have fun
Bitches are like Pringles, you can't eat just one
Save the commitment shit for a committed nigga
I'll be committed to a bitch pullin in five figures
But my pockets got a padlock, they stay stocked
Money grabbers after mine and nine stays cocked
Forget a relationship, listen honeydip
I'm on that tip, cause I ain't shit!

[Chorus: Apache]
(Apache you ain't shit!) That's what they're sayin G
(Apache you ain't shit!) So what you playin me?
(Apache you ain't shit!) So fuckin what?
(Apache you ain't shit!) J drop a cut
