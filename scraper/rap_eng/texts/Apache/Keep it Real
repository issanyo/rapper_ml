[Intro]
And you don't stop

[Verse 1]
Rappers grow, develop flows, do shows, get hoes
Make it big, then start steppin' on toes
But you missed one, mine, now you can't last
Step on my toe, you get ten toes up that ass
Don't even think about tryin' some snake shit
Okay, today we're talkin' about fake shit
Was it a friend or colleague, tell me what was it?
You flipped your script when you got your bullshit budget
You went gold and can't speak no more
Fuck you, your crew, and your fuckin' tour
Poppin' shit behind my back, time to get got
The penalty for that is five to ten speed-knots
I'm here to bully and bogart, I hit hard
Set em up to get wet up, dump em in somebody's yard
Tie em up and make em squeal
The last three words he hears is 'keep it real'

Keep it real
And you don't stop
(And I'ma let you know)
Keep it real
(Probably a punk)

[Verse 2]
Industry rule number 4080-one
(If you come to battle, bring-bring a shot-shotgun)
I hate the fake, if you perpatrate, flee
Time to wreck shop, and all you can do is stop speakin' to me
MC's that get too big for their britches
End up in stitches or gettin' robbed for their fuckin' riches
Forgot where you came from, gassed up
Go back to your old block and niggas smack that ass up
You know the rules, challenge him to a rap scrimmage
Sha said (Yo, 'Pache chill, that's just his image
And shit) So I chill and won't say shit, see
No bull, I got pull, only a handful can fuck with me
Bringin' misery is my mission in '93
So be nice and think twice before steppin' to me
Tie him up and make him squeal
The last three words he hears is 'keep it real'

[Verse 3]
Some new fame is like a flame, let me explain
It can blaze for days, then it's out, but who's to blame?
You, or is it the things you do or did?
In fact, sometimes I think back to when I was a kid
Times were hard, I got harder
Couldn't afford a 40, so you didn't wanna be bothered
Wouldn't pass a spliff, couldn't get a lift
Started runnin' with the Flavor U and got swift
Now you come around talkin' that 'we boys' shit
The way I live, I forgive, but I don't forget
Tie him up and make him squeal
The last three words he hears is 'keep it real'
