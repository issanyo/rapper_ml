[Hook: Apache]
I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I wanna "Gangsta boogie!" with my (gangsta bitch)
I want a (gangsta bitch) I need a (gangsta bitch)
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 1]
Yo, I need a gangsta bitch; she don't sleep and she don't play
Stickin up girls from around the fuckin way
Strapped but lovable, hateful but huggable
Always in trouble and definitely fuckable
See her now, booms and pounds, she's mine friend
Puffin on a blunt, sippin on a Heineken
She's got charm, a firearm to match mine
Going to the movies packin' his-and-her nines
Wearin Carhartt and leather, motherfuck the weather
On Valentine's Day, doin stick-ups together
No one to blame, no shame in her game
And when we fuck she makes me scream out her name
She's not petty; confident, ready
Right for late night, we play fight with machetes.
This goes out to all the gangsta ho pros:
Give me a ghetto girl, fuck a Soul Train ho

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She likes to party with her posse and drink beer
Pour a little bit out for the sisters who ain't here
She's not the one, player you might get done
Her idea of fun's takin her son shoppin for a gun
Likes to dress to impress, quick to attack
When your punk-ass boys run, you know she's got your back
In a Benz with her friends, AMG kit
Drivin down the street pumpin, "Apache you ain't shit!"
Snappin on niggas, takin no shorts
Sittin on a porch, pullin on a Newport
Minds her business, knows 'cause she hears things
Fat herringbone and diamond studded earrings
She's a thoroughbred, walks and talks with class
Try to get fast, she just might slap your ass
Come meet my moms, but the two might not click
Parents just don't understand...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I had a church girl, quiet girl, one girl was rich
The most memorable girl was a gangsta bitch
We went out a lot, sometimes we dressed the same
Lickin shots in the park and had pet names
I called her 'Dollars' 'cause that's what she liked to spend
She called me 'Diamond' cause my dick was her best friend
If you owed her dough, then you had to pay
Bought her an AK for her 21st birthday
We packed up and shacked up, didn't need a job
Engaged to a criminal and married to the mob
I gave MCs injuries and beat 'em down
While she's, pickin up ki's, from Uptown
Sad to say one day got caught out there
I shed a tear when the judge said five years
She's gone now so it's time to make my switch
So who'll be my next gangsta bitch?
