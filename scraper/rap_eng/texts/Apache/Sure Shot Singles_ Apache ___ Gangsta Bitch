”Gangsta Bitch” b/w “Apache Ain’t Shit”

Tommy Boy
Production: artist, Q-Tip, Sid Reynolds

The Flavor Unit’s self-proclaimed “Hip-Hop Green Beret” slows the pace down with an ode to the woman of his dreams. The ruff ‘n rugged Apache is man enough to admit that he needs a special woman to fulfill his needs.

     Q-Tip’s compelling slow jam track makes this “Around The Way Girl” parody even more captivating. Has anybody seen this girl? “I need a gangsta bitch, she don’t sleep and she don’t play/Stickin’ up girls from around the fuckin’ way. . . She’s got charm/A firearm to match mine/Goin’ to the movies packin’ his and her nines/Wearin’ Carhartt and leather/Motherfuck the weather/On Valentine’s Day doin’ stick-ups together.” Ahh yes, the perfect picture of young love.

     On the flip side, Apache gets down to business and unleashes his feared, rapidfire lyrical skills. Rather than let someone else criticize him, he does it for you. You won’t be able to say anything he hasn’t already said about himself after you hear “Apache Ain’t Shit.” It gets no ruffer.
