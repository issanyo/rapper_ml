These are a couple more poems from the summer of 2016, that I thought didn’t stink. There are more of these on YouTube, it’s hard to get the rights to legally release them, so enjoy and if you really like ‘em, go down the YouTube hole and there’s more.
I love you, this is "i was born in detroit on a very very very very very very very cold day", Part 2.
