[Intro: Mike Posner & Blackbear]
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her

[Verse 1: Blackbear]
Would you give me a moment? Give me a try
Don't leave me hanging, no, that isn't right
Why do we do this? Throw me a lie
You like the attention, and you get what you like

[Pre-Chorus: Blackbear]
I just wanna get you closer
I don't wanna play these games
All you wanna be is wanted
Makes your ego okay
Why you gotta tease me, baby?
Why you gotta play these games?
Every time you come over
I don't ever get no play

[Chorus: Blackbear & Mike Posner]
She's fucking wicked
But I love the way she hurts me
I'm so addicted to her loving
That girl is vicious
When you see her, be sure
That you're keeping your distance
From her loving, ooh

[Drop: Loote]

[Post-Chorus: Mike Posner]
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her

[Verse 2: Blackbear]
I'm being the good guy, I'm being polite
You tell me I'm too nice, maybe you're right
And I don't wanna hear that, I ain't your type
What does that even mean, girl? Can I get a reply?

[Pre-Chorus: Blackbear]
I just wanna get you closer
I don't wanna play this games
All you wanna be is wanted
Make sure he go, "Okay"
Why you gotta tease me, baby?
Why you gotta be this way?
Every time you come over
I don't ever get no play

[Chorus: Blackbear & Mike Posner]
She's fucking wicked
But I love the way she hurts me
I'm so addicted to her loving
That girl is vicious
When you see her, be sure
That you're keeping your distance
From her loving

[Post-Chorus: Mike Posner]
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her

[Chorus: Blackbear & Mike Posner]
She's fucking wicked
But I love the way she hurts me
I'm so addicted to her loving
That girl is vicious
When you see her, be sure
That you're keeping your distance
From her loving

[Post-Chorus: Mike Posner]
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
