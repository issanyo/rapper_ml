A song with Pitbull

I got an email this morning
It's from a record label ANR
They want me to do a song with Pitbull
My part is already written
They are sure it will be a big hit

Who makes art this way?
I want to move to the mountains
I want to throw frisbees in places I haven't been yet
I want to have sex with men and women I haven't met yet
I want to skydive, I want to sing
I want to hurt people, I want to get hurt by those same people
And pretend like it all matters before I die

But they want me to do a song with Pitbull
Fuck you
