[Intro: Blackbear]
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Blackbear]
Rich white girls
All I'm doing is wasting my time chasing rich white girls, yeah
All they do is bitch and they whine
So tell me what could I give you that your daddy can't give you?
Baby, what could I give, to a rich white girl?
They only love me when I pay 'em no mind

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Your purses, your girlfriend's, your love of hurting me
My new car, my new house, my insecurities
You kiss me as if it's a favor done for me, woah, uh
And dating a man like me is just a change in scenery
'Cause you never learned what it's like to treat someone decently

[Chorus: Mike Posner & Blackbear]
You're just a rich white girl
And all I'm doing is wasting my time chasing rich white girls
All they do is bitch and they whine
So tell me what could I give you that your daddy can't give you?
Baby, what could I give, to a rich white girl?
They only love me when I pay 'em no mind (love me when I pay 'em no mind)

[Verse 2: Mike Posner & Blackbear]
I thought that the last tour would help me fill the hole
And then came the income, outcome I'm still alone
So now I'm just tryna distract my self with you, woah
And you were born inside a castle next to the sea
So how you gonna wake up in a hotel room next to me

[Chorus: Blackbear & Mike Posner]
Rich white girls
All I'm doing is wasting my time chasing rich white girls, yeah
All they do is bitch and they whine
So tell me what could I give you that your daddy can't give you?
Baby, what could I give, ooh
Tell me what could I give you that your daddy can't give you?
Baby, what could I give, to a rich white girl?
And all I'm doing is wasting my time chasing rich white girls
All they do is bitch and they whine
So tell me what could I give you that your daddy can't give you?
Baby, what could I give (what could I give)
Tell me what could I give you that your daddy can't give you?
Baby, what could I give, to a rich white girl?
They only love me when I pay 'em no mind

[Spoken Outro: Snooze God, blackbear & Mike Posner]
You just some rich white boys
And all these girls is wasting they time
And Bear got like 30 in line (yup)
Mike got a couple in line (uh huh)
You know what I mean
What about you, Snooze?
Shit, I'm just tryna sell these VIPs and hit the strip club man, you know me
