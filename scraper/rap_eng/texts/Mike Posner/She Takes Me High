[Mike Posner]
She takes me high [x4]

[Verse 1: We The Kings]
Last nights dream
We rode our bikes
To our tree house by the sea
And there we laid and said we'd never leave

Last nights dream
I promised you would have
The whole world at your feet
And that we'd lay on a bed we made of leaves

[Hook: Mike Posner]
And we both know
You're everything I need
And now I know
What she does to me

[Hook: We The Kings]
She takes me high [x4]
She wakes me up
She breaks me down
Shes got me 10 feet off the ground
She takes me High, high, tonight

[Verse 2: We The Kings]
Last nights dream
We drove your car
To the dead end of your street
And we made love where no one else could see

Last nights dream
I held your hand
And asked if you would be
Forever mine, together you and me

[Hook: Mike Posner]
And we both know
You're everything I need
And now I know
What she does to me, yeah

[Hook: We The Kings]
She takes me high[x4]
She wakes me up
She breaks me down
Shes got me 10 feet off the ground
She takes me high tonight

[Interlude: We The Kings]
I'll keep sleeping
If I don't stop dreaming
I would stop my breathing for you
I'm not leaving
This life I'm dreaming
Cause I can't stop living with you

[Mike Posner]
She takes me high[x4]

[We The Kings]
She takes me high[x4]

[Hook: We The Kings & Mike Posner]
She wakes me up
She breaks me down
Shes got me 10 feet off the ground
She takes me High, high, tonight
