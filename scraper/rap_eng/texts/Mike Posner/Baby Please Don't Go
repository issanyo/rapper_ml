Let's run away, from these lies
Back to yesterday
Safe tonight
I feel the sun creepin' up like tick tock
I'll try to keep you in my head, but if not
We'll just keep running from tomorrow
With our lips locked
Yeah, you've got me begging, begging
Baby please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here
I don't know, if you feel the way I do
If you leave I'm going to find you
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't, baby please don't
Baby please don't run away from my bed
Start another day stay instead
I feel the sun creepin' up like tick tock
I'll try to keep you in my head but if not
We'll just keep running from tomorrow
With our lips locked
Yeah, you've got me begging, begging
Baby please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here
I don't know, if you feel the way I do
If you leave I'm going to find you
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't, baby please don't, baby please don't
Running from tomorrow
I stay running from tomorrow
I stay running from tomorrow
I stay running from tomorrow
Baby please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here
I don't know, if you feel the way I do
If you leave I'm going to find you
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't go, go, go, go
Baby please don't, baby please don't, baby plase don't runaway
