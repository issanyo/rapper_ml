[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
All I really know is that I felt OK
When I met you in April
You were looking like May
I know you like to run girl
So go on and set the pace
The liquor never tastes good
But I don't need to chase

[Hook: Nick Jonas]
Take another hit
Just fake it till you feel it
Open up and let me in
I just wanna feel you

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Like the sun in December
Or a lemonade in June
I know what you want girl
Cause I want it too
Have you ever noticed
That I can't see straight
Cause I'm hooked on your body
Got me glued to your waist

[Hook: Nick Jonas]
Take another hit
Just fake it till you feel it
Open up and let me in
I just wanna feel you

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment

[Verse 3: Mike Posner]
Aye
Wuddup Nick?
Alright
I look good, I smell good, I fuck good too
I'm looking around like
She would, and she would, and she probably would too (yup)
I'm sittin' on the couch like it's my house
You a bad girl, take a time out
Matter fact, you can bring a friend
My voice sound like silk in the wind
Henny bottles on my table
The owner was a fan, so that's already paid for
Girls lookin' at me like I got a halo
I don't do second dates, that's just how the game go
Look at my life, I made that shit
Look at my car, I suede that shit
Replay that shit
She don't fuck white boys
I'm a change that shit

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
