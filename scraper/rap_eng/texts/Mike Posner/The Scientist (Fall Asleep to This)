[Verse One]
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming in tales
Heads are a science apart

[Hook]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No-one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

[Verse Two]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Don't speak as loud as my heart

[Hook]

I'm going back to the start

Oh, ooooo
Ah, ooooo
Oh, ooooo
Oh, ooooo
