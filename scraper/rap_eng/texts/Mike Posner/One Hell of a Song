[Verse 1]
This is what the Lord wants me to do
In my heart, I just believe that there's no proof
I think about the chorus, the melody's important
But nothing sounds sweeter than the truth
I used to sip the whiskey and hit the bong
I gave that up, now all my friends are gone
And my folks don't understand I ain't no macho man
But I know how to write one hell of a song

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a shy young man with a real big heart
I still haven't found where I belong
But you know my sweet Lord gave me just one thing
Darling, I know how to write one hell of a song
Yeah, I know how to write one hell of a song

[Verse 2]
Wrote one for Snoop, did not take long
Wrote one for Bieber and one for Sean
And Jay Z offered me a deal
I said "Dawg, throw in another mil"
Cause you know I can write one hell of a song

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a shy young man with a real big heart
I still haven't found where I belong
But you know my sweet Lord gave me just one thing
Darling, I know how to write one hell of a song
Yeah, I know how to write one hell of a song

[Outro]
Sometimes I stay up well past dawn
If God puts one in my head, that's what he wants
I'm a simple type of artist, I don't like to walk red carpets
I would rather write one hell of a song
Yeah, I wrote this and it's one hell of a song
