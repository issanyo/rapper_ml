(Verse 1)
Remember those things I said
Well I don’t mean none of em now
You’re acting like a different person
I couldn’t pick you out of a crowd
I know bout all the things you did
There’s nothing left to talk about
Baby take off your halo (oo oo)
You ain’t nobodies angel now

So you can keep playin
I can't hear nothing that ya sayin
And sorry won’t change it
Girl I’m bout to put you out

(Bridge)
Don’t try to apologize
Or try to call me phone no more
Baby take off your halo
It doesn’t even glow no more
There’s not gon’ be no second chance
Don’t try to show up back at my door
Baby take off your Halo
What kind of fool do you take me for?

(Hook)
Take off your halo (halo)
Take off your halo (halo)
Take off your halo (halo)
Take off your halo (halo)
Take off your halo (halo)
Take off your halo (halo)
Take off your halo (halo)

(Verse 2)
I don’t wanna hear your explanations
Your not gon talk your way out of this
I know exactly what your gonna try to say
And im not gon fall for none of your tricks
Go ahead and cry if you want to
Go and tell it to the dude that you were with
The second that I walk away
Baby girl you don’t even exist

So you can keep playin
I can't hear nothing that you sayin
And sorry won't change it
Don’t try to come at me with none of your sh—

(Bridge)

(Hook)
