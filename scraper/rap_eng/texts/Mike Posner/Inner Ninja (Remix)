[Intro]
Ninja? You're a ninja? Get out of here, you're a ninja! Yes, I am a ninja

[Bridge: David Myles]
I read the rules before I broke 'em
I broke the chains before they choked me out
Now I pay close attention
Really learn the code
I learned to read the map before I hit the road

[Verse 1: Classified]
Hey yo, I know you never heard this before
But I'd rather lose a fight than miss the war
And I ain't wishing competition or fishing for it
I'm just living in the system, conditions are poor
I've been lost in the rhythm and misinformed
Too many late nights hitting the liquor store
Too many bad decisions, half-assed attempts
No sweat, no fear, no blood, no tears
I go hard and I ain't making up no excuse
I'm overdue, I don't do what I'm supposed to do
Cause you can think about it man, we're supposed to lose
It ain't all picture perfect, ocean views
No, I was a first class rookie
Taking out bullies in my all black hoodie
Man of mystery, you know the history
Get it or forget it, cause poof, I'm outta here

[Bridge: David Myles]
I read the rules before I broke 'em
I broke the chains before they choked me out
Now I pay close attention
Really learn the code
I learned to read the map before I hit the road

[Hook]
Nobody's gonna see me coming
Nobody's gonna hear a sound
No matter how hard they trying
No stopping me since I've found
My inner ninja (x4)

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Alright
I'm just feeling like this all year
All these kids used to call me weird
I wish they could just reappear
I wish they could just see me here
You know cause I'm fightin' for my inner, inner
You can never stop me, I'm a winner winner
Couple beats in my backpack
Turn them into plat plaques
And you know, poof, dinner, dinner

Remember back in '09 Kanye told me that my demo was whack (Oh no)
Two years later, Kanye told me that my new shit was dope
And that's because it is, I handled all my biz
A little less eyes, baby
Little more years
Takes a little practice to do it like this
This is in my mind, homie
Run that shit

[Bridge 2: Mike Posner]
I had bad habits but I dropped them
I had opponents, but I knocked them out
I climbed the highest mountain
Swam across the coldest sea
There ain't a thang I've faced that's been too much for me

[Hook]
Nobody's gonna see me coming
Nobody's gonna hear a sound
No matter how hard they trying
Nobody's gonna bring me down

Nobody's gonna see me coming
Nobody's gonna hear a sound
No matter how hard they trying
No stopping me since I've found
My inner ninja (x4)

[Bridge 2: Mike Posner]
I had bad habits but I dropped them

I climbed the highest mountain
Swam across the coldest sea
There ain't a thang I've faced that's been too much for me

My inner ninja
