[Intro: Rusko]
Shut up, Shut up
Shut up, Shut up
Shut up, Shut up
Shut up, Shut up
Shut up, Shut up

[Hook]
Shut up
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up
Shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up
Shut up
Shut your mouth, shut your mouth

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Do I look like one of your girl friends?
Like I care about your day, I don't
You're always talking bout your feelings and shit
I just nod and say ok

Cause I paid for the dinner
Paid for the movie
Paid for the booze
Even tried to pretend that I give a goddamn about them vampire dudes
I don’t mean to be rude but I gotta tell you that it ain't ok
Just come into my room I can make it go boom
Don’t say a thing just

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
It's not that I don't care girl, well kinda
You're just looking so damn fine
I speak best with my body babe
You should give that shit a try
Cause I paid for the dinner
Paid for the movie
Paid for the booze
Even tried to pretend that I give a goddamn about them vampire dudes
I don't mean to be rude, but I gotta tell you that it ain't OK
Just come into my room, I can make you go boom
Don't say a thing just

[Hook x2]

My friends are gonna ask me
If you let me hit it
Let me hit it
So please don't make me say I didn't
Say I didn't

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Rusko]
Shut up, Shut up
Shut up, Shut up
Shut up, Shut up
Shut up, Shut up
Shut up, Shut up
