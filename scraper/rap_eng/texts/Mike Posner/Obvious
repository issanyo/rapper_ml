[Verse 1: Blackbear]
Where do I turn to?
Girl if it ain't you
Why you be playing these games?
And all of my friends say
That you are sus, but
Girl I still fuck with you either way
You act like I don't know
When you say you're all alone
I know that you're with him
Girl I can't fuck with you anymore
Girl I can't fuck with you

[Chorus: Blackbear]
Let's just state the obvious
Let's just state the truth
Let's just state the obvious
You're done with me and I'm done with you
You're done with me and I'm done with you
Done with me and I'm done with you

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Alright, cigarettes and a sip of wine
You don't have a happy life so you shit on mine
You wanna cut me up, baby you should get in line
I know it burns right now, but you'll forget in time
That I used to be your man, remember?
That I used to hold your hand, remember?
You told me you would stay down for whatever
Keep it real any weather from November to November
Then came the life of the on-call barber
Where we walk around in all our armor
And if I'm bein' honest, I'm caught up in this contest
Of which L.A. male can ball out harder
Shit, probably me
We were doomed from the start, baby how did we meet?
I slipped you a smile I was fakin'
You was servin' bottles to me half naked
That was uncalled for, ego's out of control
So I had to let you go cause I'm stubborn
I wait a little bit of time
Now I'm readin' online you're fuckin' Jared Leto's brother
No offense to him if I see him at the Beverly
I'm 28 now, tryna figure my identity
The worst memories are the good memories
It's obvi' you were never meant for me

[Chorus: Blackbear & Mike Posner]
Let's just state the obvious
Let's just state the truth
Let's just state the truth
Let's just state the obvious
You're done with me and I'm done with you
Done with me and I'm done with you
You're done with me and I'm done with you
You're done with me and I'm done with you
You're done with me and I'm done with you
You're done with me and I'm done with you
You're done with me and I'm done with you
You're done with me and I'm done with you
