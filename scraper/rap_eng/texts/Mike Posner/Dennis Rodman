[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Sittin' in the goddamn 'Lac
Ridin' clean with my homies in the back
If you were me, you'd do the same thang
I got 20 women swimmin' in my brain
Yeah, I'm sittin' in the goddamn 'Lac (Ya dig it)
Bangin' Premo, yeah my shit boom bap (Ya dig it)
Got the windows down, AC max (Woo)
And we bumpin' "Return of the Mack" (Ya dig it)

[Chorus: Mike Posner & blackbear]
I'm gon' do whatever it is I want to, baby
I'm gon' do whatever it is I feel
I don't care 'bout who's watching
Dennis Rodman
Dennis Rodman

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Yeah, sittin' in the clean Impala
We're class 2010, I'm a scholar
If you were me, you'd do the same thang
Might hit Roscoe's, get a chicken wing
Yeah, sittin' in the clean Impala (Ya dig it)
Finna have you sippin' on Odwalla
And if you bad, then, baby, I'll holla (Hey, girl)
Make your girl disappear, voila!

[Chorus: Mike Posner & blackbear]
I'm gon' do whatever it is I want to, baby
I'm gon' do whatever it is I feel
I don't care 'bout who's watching
Dennis Rodman
Dennis, Dennis, Dennis Rodman

[Verse 3: blackbear & Mike Posner]
Yeah, I'ma wear a dress if I want to
Green hair, fishnets if I want to
Smoke, drink, do drugs if I want to
I ain't really trying to impress you
I'ma be as bad as I wanna be
You can be as mad as you wanna be
I'ma spend whatever when I'm shoppin'
I don't plan on stoppin', people keep talkin'
Dennis Rodman
Dennis, yo, Dennis, talk yo shit, dog

[Outro: Dennis Rodman & Mike Posner]
Here we go, Dennis Rodman
I'ma talk about myself
Because a lot of people don't wanna talk about Dennis Rodman anymore because they think he's a has-been
They ask me, "When are you gonna slow down, man?"
Dennis Rodman
I said, "I don't give a fuck, man, I'ma go do Dennis Rodman"
Let's say it again, Dennis fucking Rodman
Dennis Rodman
