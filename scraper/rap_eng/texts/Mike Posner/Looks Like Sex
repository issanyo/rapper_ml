[Verse 1]
Alright
Forget them other boys baby
Forget them other guys
Yeah I see your nose ring
Might as well be a bulls-eye
Used to pull girls like you, nope!
Not in 09'
You ain't a mixtape chick baby
Had to sell a million for your time

[Bridge]
Say ayo
Can you hear me? Uh, can you hear me?
One more time, say ayo
Can you hear me?
I can make it rain, make it soak all night
You just give me a chance make it feel alright

That ass makes me want to oooh
You know exactly what you do
I would really like to take that home
Everybody here knows

[Hook]
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like...

[Verse 2]
Liking what I see girl
Trying not to let it show
Let me see your brain's up
You gotta let them know
I don't mean to be rude but
Baby I can break you off
You can sleep with the minute man
But I'm all night long
