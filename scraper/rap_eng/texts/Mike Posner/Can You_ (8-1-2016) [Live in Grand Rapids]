Cigarettes and a sip of wine
We grew up
Tryna fill in missing time
With getting high
Or on the cheers of the crowd
Or on god on this divine
Rooted to oak tree
I hold the
Record for turning the most nose bleeds to front row seats
Most nose bleeds to front row seats

(sigh)
Tryin’ to not take this whole time for granted
Granted
I am four years older now
It’s hard to imagine getting the cold shoulder now
We don’t feel like a band we feel like six soldiers out
On the battlefield every night
And we play our asses off so you can have memories like
So you can have memories like this
This has been described as
“A moment of being” by Virginia Woolf
“It” by Kerouac
“Rapture” by the scriptures
And most recently
“This” by me.

Strobe lights and storms
Hit songs from dawns
Embarrassed at the fact that I still want awards
I told Big Sean if I got signed I would never buy a chain
I bought four
I lost ‘em all on a Delta flight
And I haven’t bought more
I think imma take the money
Put a message in a bottle and hope it washes up on God’s shore
And inside it will read
“The journey to more is a circle
It starts with wanting more
And it ends with wanting more
It’s great to love your enemy
It’s better to not be in a war”
That’s why I continue on this odyssey with these ten dudes
We vagabonding a tour bus across this country from venue to venue
Just to tell you
Wake the fuck up, you are eating the menu
Put your phone down wake up, you are eating the menu!
Grand Rapids wake up, you are eating the menu!
Wake the fuck up, you are eating the menu!
You are eating the fucking menu!
You are eating the menu

I can see a better life in my head
A better world
Can you?
