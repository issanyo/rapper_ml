[Verse 1]
Take off you make-up, take off your clothes
I wanna wake up next to your nose
Would you let me linger on your lips
I'm still wrapped 'round your fingertips
And if I had me a rocket ship I just fly back home

[Chorus]
'Cause I've looked in New York City
And I've checked in Boston too
I've found a couple that were pretty
But I'm still gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you

[Verse 2]
Why don't you slow down?
I can feel it all now
Your heart is raising, I'm still here
Let your hair down and fear not
'Cause I am going nowhere

[Chorus]
Yes, I've looked in San Fransisco
And I checked all through L.A
I looked in Dallas, Texas
But something didn't feel the same
So I looked in Detroit City
And then I checked back at Duke
I found a couple that were pretty
But I'm still gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you

[Outro]
Searched in New York City
Checked in Boston too
Found a couple that were pretty
Still gonna stay with you
