[Intro: DJ Don Cannon]
Yeah, you know what time it is
It's time to give you another exclusive
Mike Posner's new single off his new album "Sky High" that's coming in 2012
Y'all motherfuckers ain't ready for this
We got hits on top of hits on top of hits
Straight hits, drop that trick

[Verse 1]
Alright
Forget them other boys baby
Forget them other guys
Yeah I see your nose ring
Might as well be a bull-bullsseye
Used to pull girls like you
Nope, not in 09'
You ain't a mixtape chick baby
Had to sell a million for your time

[Pre-Chorus]
Say hey
Can you hear me? Uh, can you hear me?
One more time, say ayo
Can you hear me?
I can make it rain, make it soak all night
You just give me a chance make it feel alright

[Chorus]
That ass makes me want to oooh
You know exactly what you do
I would really like to take that home
Everybody here knows
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex

[Outro: DJ Don Cannon]
Alright, Benzi, that's enough
Cut that shit off, man
Go and support your boy Mike Posner
On iTunes when it drops, the full version
Benzi, let's hit 'em with another classic
The Layover, Don Cannon, yeah
