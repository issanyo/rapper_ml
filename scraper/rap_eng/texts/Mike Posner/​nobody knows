Part I

[Chorus: Soren Bryce]
Nobody knows, nobody knows, no one
You'll never know, you'll never know me, hon
Nobody knows, nobody knows, no one
You'll never know, you'll never know me, hon

[Verse 1: Blackbear]
I hate all the things that I love
I love this whole bottle of NyQuil
I never can get enough
I keep my main girl on the side still
I took two more, don't judge me
I used to hope everyone loved me
Now I could just give a fuck
I hate all the things that I love
I hate all the things that I love
I love this whole bottle of Jameson
I love all the things that don't make sense
Like I love you
So I love all the things that I hate
It would be better if you moved away
Maybe somewhere with clouds and more rain
Where you don't know me 'cause you don't know me anyway

[Chorus: Soren Bryce & Blackbear]
Nobody knows, nobody knows, no one
You'll never know, you'll never know me, hon
You don't know me anyway
Nobody knows, nobody knows, no one
You'll never know, you'll never know

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
I hate all the things that I love
I don't really know what to tell you
I'm not gonna break out this shell
For you in this little hotel room
'Cause I know when you look at me
That you just see something to gain, girl
You don't know who I have become
Don't call me my government name, girl
I can see where this is headed, hey
You're already fading away in my mind
Your mouth is not moving, it's saying it's fine
But I know that I cannot make up the time
For all the hurt that your daddy put on you
I'd rather take a Caddy to Atlanta and slide through
To Little Ronny's house, I'd pretend I'm Bill Bellamy
Hit up 2 Chainz (2 Chainz!), I'll prolly sell a beat
You've never met a man like me, I don't fit in your plan (tell 'em!)
I'm a multi-millionaire that's livin' in a van
And I am not your husband, not your boyfriend, not your man
I am simply somethin' I don't think you understand, no one

[Chorus: Soren Bryce & Mike Posner]
Nobody knows, nobody knows, no one (no one)
You'll never know, you'll never know me, hon
Nobody knows, nobody knows, no one (no one)
You'll never know, you'll never know me, hon

Part II

[Intro]
Oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 3: Blackbear & Mike Posner]
I hate all the things that I love
I wanna believe in religion
But nobody reminds me of God
I wanna believe in what I hear and what I read
But it mostly reminds me I'm lost
I wanna believe that when I fuck it's romantic
But no lovers remind me of love
I hate all the things that I love
And I need to believe in moderation
'Cause believers believe in too much
I learned to lie
I learned to lie when I was younger
Tell me somethin' true
Tell me somethin' true
Oh, tell me somethin' true
Tell me somethin' true

[Verse 4: Mike Posner]
This whole fuckin' thing is a front
The beard, the love and the cameras
I've kept it all up for years
Now I don't have too much more stamina
And I haven't been this depressed
Since sophomore year in my trenchcoat
Silently screamin' out
"Why the fuck I gotta ride this bench, coach?"
Females beware, I'm reckless, I'm loose
My smile is my makeup, my necklace is my noose
And I know all the words that you're tryin' to hear
The same three ones that got me hidin' in fear
Are they I love you? There, is that enough?
But don't say I never warned you
I hate all the things that I love

[Outro]
Oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
