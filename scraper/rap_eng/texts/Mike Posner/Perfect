[Intro]
People want to know (You, if you, if you, if you, if, if you, if)
People want to know (You, if you, if you, if you, if, if you, if)
People want to know (You, if you, if you, if you, if, if you, if)
People want to know (You, if you, if you, if you, if, if you, if)

[Chorus]
If you ever get tired being perfect
Do you ever get tired being perfect?

[Verse 1]
I got on a flight, the plane's brand new
We can make it to New York in an hour or two
Look down on the city from heights high as these
Everything's perfect
And my friend tells me that I'm too nice
Her voice trails off, I know she wants advice
I recycle some quote I heard Dillon write
It's that everything's perfect

[Bridge]
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)

[Verse 2]
When I wake up before you and just watch you sleep, that's
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
And you tell me later you were dreaming of me
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When I walk down the street and the trees know my name
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
People I don't know around an open flame, that's
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
A grandmother's fingers around a granddaughter's hand
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
People speaking languages that I don't understand (That's)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When you stare into my eyes and I'm thinking you're the one that's
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When my mama tells me that she's proud of what I've done
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When the winter ends in the city that I'm from (That's)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When I open up and get hurt by someone (That's)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When you trust somebody and they don't let you down (That's)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When somebody you love dies, but you still feel 'em around

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Do you ever get tired (Oh, yeah)
Of being perfect?
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Yeah)
Do you ever get tired (Oh, yeah)
Of being perfect?
