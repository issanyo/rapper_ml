[Intro]
I can do it anyway you want it, yeah
I’m the same as the way I stared
I can do it anyway you want it
Alright, yeah

[Hook]
I’d like to propose a toast
To the future, here’s a toast
To the past
Grab a glass, I'mma turn this bottle upside down
Tomorrow to my momma, hope I’m making you proud
Here’s a toast, to right now

[Verse 1]
This one’s for Ray for telling me not to stop dreamin'
This one’s for Mackme who held me down from the start
I’ve been trying to chase back down the feelin'
That I probably never even really had to start
I remember when I told my mom
The record label really liked my song
She told me "Mike stop smoking weed"
Now she sees me on the TV

[Hook]
I’d like to propose a toast
To the future, here’s a toast
To the past
Grab a glass, I'mma turn this bottle upside down
Tomorrow to my momma, hope I’m making you proud
Here’s a toast, to right now

[Verse 2]
To the Jack in the bottom of my Solo cup now
To the thangs that he’s about to make me do
I would probably do the same shit if I was sober
I just use that as my excuse
I remember when I told my friends
Just wait until 20-10
And I'mma have my CD on a shelf
At least that’s what I would tell myself

[Hook]
I’d like to propose a toast
To the future, here’s a toast
To the past
Grab a glass, I'mma turn this bottle upside down
Tomorrow to my momma, hope I’m making you proud
Here’s a toast, to right now

[Outro]
I could do it anyway you wanted
I’m the same as the way I started
I could do it anyway you wanted
Yeah I’m the same
