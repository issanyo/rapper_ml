Come on
Ready, one, two--

Let's go back, I know it's been a minute
But I can do it better than I did when I did it
You were loving me, I was loving you
You can come over and we can have déjà vu
We can have déjà vu
You can come over and

Probably gonna compliment your hairdo
Right before we mess that shit all up
(Mess that shit all up)

Look at me now, I'm all grown up
(Look at me, I'm grown up)

She was reminiscin' in her mind
I'm just trying make up for lost time
Don't be acting nervous

Look at us now, we're all grown up
(Look at us now, we're grown up)

But I can do it better than I did when I did it
You were loving me, I was loving you
You can come over and we can have déjà vu
We can have déjà vu
You can come over and

You still feel the same
And don't pretend like you don't want to like I do
I know you think about
What can we feel like now
Come over, let's make a new memory

Let's go back, I know it's been a minute
But I can do it better than I did when I did it
You were loving me, I was loving you
You can come over and we can have déjà vu
We can have déjà vu
You can come over and
