Delta 1406

[Hook]
I can't come down
Not today, I feel alright
They believe every word I say
And it seems so jaded
Every place I go, it feels so jaded
There's people all around but I'm all alone

[Verse 1]
The clock in my head won't stop ticking, ticking
The phone in my hand rings all day long
I've been in L.A. almost five months now
I try to pretend that it feels like home
(Oh, oh)
Maybe I flew too far
Shooting stars leave no mark

[Hook]
I can't come down
Not today, I feel alright
They believe every word I say
It seems so jaded
Every place I go, it feels so jaded
There's people all around but I'm all alone

[Verse 2]
I know my dad only got a few years now
He's gone cry when he hears this song
And things with mom have become so weird now
I gotta book hotels for my Detroit shows
(Oh, oh)
Maybe I flew too far
Shooting stars leave no mark

[Hook]
I can't come down
Not today, I feel alright
They believe every word I say
And it seems so jaded
Every place I go, it feels so jaded
There's people all around but I'm all alone
