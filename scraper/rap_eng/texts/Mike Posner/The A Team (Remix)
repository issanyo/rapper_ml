[Verse 1]
I went to school with Maria, the other day I seen her
Dancing up and down on the pole
When I was smoking on sativa
She was a cheerleader
What happened to her? Nobody knows
Got me feeling like an asshole
I got it perfect, and I don’t know
If I deserve it
And when I’m on stage, I see a memory
It fucks me up cause, it could have been me

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say she’s on the class a team
Stuck in her day dream
Been this way since 18, but lately
Her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries and they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
Cause we’re just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
She don’t wanna go outside tonight
And in her pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
And it’s too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

[Verse 2]
I ain’t spoken to my best friend in over two years
It’s fucked up cause he’s addicted to them pills
And he’s fucked up
Not too long ago, we was on the come up
Your two best friends got signed, no such luck
See you was in the group with Sean
When he was still Sean The Don
And we was all just tryin' not to wake up my mom
But Kanye didn’t want you
A couple years later then I got signed too
You always felt like we didn’t do enough for you
If you done been patient, we could make more moves
And now I’m hearing stories
I know your two best friends just living our your dreams
I love you Pat
I love you Pat
I feel like I let you down and there ain’t no fucking drug for that
Here we go, here we go

[Chorus]
Cause we’re just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And he don’t wanna go outside tonight
And in the pipe he flies to the motherland
Gets dope from the pusher man
And it’s too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
