In the summer of 2016, my band and I played 66 shows, and in a vain attempt to impress my bandmates, I performed a new poem each night. I would write the poem either immediately after the show before or right before we went on stage or sometimes on the stage itself. These are just as few of those poems collected, intuitively, kind of at random, and I hope you enjoy them. This is i was born in detroit on a very very very very very very very cold day.
