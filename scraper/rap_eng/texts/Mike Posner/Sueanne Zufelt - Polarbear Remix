[Intro: Nate DeVille]
Aw yeah [x14]

[Verse 1: Polarbear]
Hey
Sittin' in a class full of students
Gotta whole lot of work, we can do this
If you were me you'd do the same thang,
I got twenty women swimmin' in my brain
Yeah I'm sittin' in a class full of students
There's a theorem on the board, gotta prove it
When our teacher get mad, she lose it
Like a bomb and we've gotta diffuse it
She says:

[Pre-Chorus: Polarbear]
Sueanne Zufelt

[Chorus 1: Sueanne Zufelt & (Nate DeVille)]
That's the crap I hate
You dadgum turkey (aw yeah)
That's the crap I hate
That's the crap I hate (aw yeah)

[Verse 2: Pike Mosner]
Hey
Sittin' at stadium seating
Zonin' out at community meeting
If you were her, you'd do the same thang
She wanna hit Roscoe's, get a chicken wing
Yeah, sittin' there acting like a balla'
Finna have you sippin' on Odwalla
And if you bad then she gon' holla
Kick you out of her room, voila

[Pre-Chorus: Polarbear]
Sueanne Zufelt
Sueanne Zufelt

[Chorus 2: Sueanne Zufelt & (Nate DeVille)]
That's the crap I hate
You dadgum turkey (aw yeah)
That's the crap I hate

[Verse 3: Polarbear]
I'mma roast Nate if I want to
Patrick, Emily if I want to
Austin, Kayden if I want to
I'mma savage and I'm gon' impress you (savage)

[Chorus 3: Polarbear & (Nate DeVille)]
Bad as I wanna be
Mad as you wanna be, Sueanne Zufelt
Bad as I wanna be
Mad as you wanna be (aw yeah)
Sueanne Zufelt

[Outro: Polarbear & (Sueanne Zufelt)]
Sueanne
Yo, Sueanne, roast some kids, dog (here we go)
