[Intro]
Just your flock, just your companians
Just your kids, just your cheeks
Just your neck, just your couch
And my perfume, and my beloved
And my breasts, and my beloved
And my love

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Yeah, I'm drowning in my own genius, that's what I'd like to think
That's the attitude I've taken on these type of things
A man can never own a woman, he just thinks he does
Add it to the list of the dirty shit I'm thinking up
Just tryna lighten up your mood, but you prefer it dark
Soften all of the places up that were hard
Put a couple of my kisses on your birthmarks
I think you're hiding who you are and that's the worst part
I never wanted to own you, just your neck
Just your good moods, just your two breasts
Just the good parts of you and your perfume, baby
Don't ask the sun to shine more like the moon, baby

[Chorus: blackbear]
Just your neck, just my couch
Just your perfume, and my beloved
And your wrists, just my couch
And my love

[Verse 2: blackbear]
Yeah, I was just seeing double, you look like extra trouble
But I can see right through you like vodka, sneaking subtle
We spent some weeks apart, I couldn't wait to see you
But I got home and it was different, I don't believe you
You was out fucking him, you know that's just the truth
Wanted to fuck with you, did not know you could be so rude
But looks could be deceiving, maybe you never see me
Maybe this all just is a movie and it's just a screening
Maybe you wanted me and I don't want you anymore
Maybe I fall in love with everything I should ignore

[Chorus: blackbear]
Just your neck, just my couch
Just your perfume, and my beloved
And your wrists, just my couch
And my love

[Verse 3: blackbear]
Yeah, maybe it's today, maybe it's tomorrow
I'm really tryna change, I'm just feeling hollow
Some were made to lead, some were made to follow
I'm all up on Raya, tryna fuck a model
Because thinking 'bout you with him made me sick
I should really beat his ass, but instead, I took your shit
You always coming at me with some kind of weakness
I don't need your secrets, I don't need your deep shit
All I really need is

[Chorus: blackbear]
Just your neck, just my couch
Just your perfume, and my beloved
And your wrists, just my couch
And my love
