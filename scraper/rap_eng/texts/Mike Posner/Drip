[Part 1]

[Intro]
Mwah

[Chorus]
Something's in the way
Oh, something in the way
I know who you are when no one's looking
Just by looking in your face

[Post-Chorus]
I'm liberated

[Bridge]
Our freedom never felt so jammin', baby

[Chorus]
Something's in the way
Oh, something in the way
I know who you are when no one's looking
Just by looking in your face

[Post-Chorus]
I'm liberated

[Part 2]

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Drip, drip, drip (Drip)
Drip, drip, drip (Drip)
Your eyes, your lies are gorgeous (Drip)
Your eyes, your lies are gorgeous

[Interlude: Mike Posner]
Avicii died, and little homie calls me up, and he's crying. (Drip) I told him, "I'ma be honest with you, if you don't get your shit together, you're next." And the truth is, by the time you hear this song, I don't fuckin' know if he's gon' be alive or not. This is all compounded by the fact that she and I do not speak anymore. I mean, am I the only one here who doesn't know what the fuck is going on? I worked the last ten years. I'm a multimillionaire. I'm thirty years old, it's supposed to all be good. It is not fucking all good. Fuck. And see, no one's really sure how long we were there for. Some say a few hours, others say a few years. All I know is a funny thing happens when you look in someone's eyes that long: you start to see their face unravel, you start to see their most beautiful and their most disgusting parts, you start to see that those are actually the same thing, you start to see them disappear, you start to see your mother, you start to see them, see you, you start to see tears, and you ain't sure who they belong to. Let 'em fall.

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Drip, drip, drip (Fuck, fuck, fuck, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)
Drip, drip, drip (Fuck, fuck, fuck, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)
Your eyes, your lies are gorgeous (Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)
Your eyes, your lies are gorgeous (Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)

[Outro: Mike Posner & Jon Posner]
Drip
Drip
Drip
I don't remember you ever running away another time from school classes, you must have. Do you?
Yeah
Did you get caught? What happened to you?
I feel like I'm always running away
