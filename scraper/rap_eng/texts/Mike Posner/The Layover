[DJ Don Cannon]
It's been a long time coming
Yo, Pose, I think these motherfuckers need a remind
Who has the hip hop singer shit on lock
I don't know what it's gonna take for motherfuckers to listen but
I told you it was a matter of time before this dude took shit over in the game
I told you he was the illest new producer
I told you he was the illest new songwriter
But did you listen? Nah
Now look at him
The dream team is back in effect
DJ Don Cannon, DJ Benzy, Mike Posner
Let's go
Welcome to The Layover
