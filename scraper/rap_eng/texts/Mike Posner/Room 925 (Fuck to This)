[Intro - Cyhi Da Prince]
Damn baby you sexy
What you scared for?
You think somebody gon' find out?
Who gon' say somethin'?
I ain't gon' tell on myself
Oh man, baby we grown
(J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League)
You feel me?

[Verse 1 - Mike Posner]
I hit first night
Now she's worried I think that she's a groupie
But I know I'm still
Probably gonna take her to the movies
Now I find myself
In another delicate situation
Cause I can't date you
We can talk 'bout it I'm at the Holiday Inn

[Hook - Mike Posner]
If you don't tell your girlfriends, I won't tell the crew
No one has to know about the crazy shit we do
I can keep it on the low girl, I don't kiss and tell
No one has to know about what goes on in this hotel
I won't tell a soul

[Verse 2 - Mike Posner]
She's mad at me
Cause I forgot to call her on her birthday
But I've been runnin' around
Doin' what makes you wanna fuck me in the first place
I don't like you
Enough to think 'bout making you my lady
I only call you
When I'm in town I know that drive you crazy

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Cyhi Da Prince]
Yeah, nope, hah
Hah, what you mean tell?
I don't even watch television
And I don't own a telescope, you feel me?

I got this girl I met in Kennesaw
Originally from Wichita
She said she from the country
So I pulled her bumpin' Tim McGraw
I got a few dollars in my budget
So I scooped her in the rental car
I took her back to the W
Reached inside the minibar
And poured us both a cup of Goose
Then I rolled up like a rubber do
First I lay you on the bed
Then I cocoa butter you
Then we do what lovers do
On top of the covers, ooh
Damn girl you sexy
You gon' make me baby mother you
Then she said, "What am I gon' tell my friends?"
And this is what I told her before I put it in

[Hook]
