(Intro)
Now you may never be on a Maybelline commercial
But you always let me know when you got some purple
See I can't let you walk away
I can't let you walk away
You need to light one with me

(Hook)
So you could be my
Drug dealer girl
So you could be my
Drug dealer girl
So you could be be be my
Drug dealer girl
So you could be my
Drug dealer girl

(Verse 1)
You might never sell enough of this stuff to move off your street
But every time I call you let me light one up for free
I'm sure that you're never ever gonna be a runway model
But you can make a bomb ass piece out of a water bottle

(Bridge)
And when you count my money
You look so sexy to me and it might sound funny
But I would by a O-Z just to get you in my bed room

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Something ‘bout the way that you weigh and bag my eighters
You even gave me my own number to put in your pager
I still never seen you cough when you hit the bong
See, gimme that shit that helps me write my songs

(Bridge)

(Hook)

Girlfriend
You should be my girlfriend
Girlfriend
My drug dealer and my
Girlfriend
You should be my girl

Girlfriend
Puff it pass it push it pedal it [x5]

(Hook)

(Outro)
You may never be on a Maybelline commercial
But you always let me know when you got some purple
See I can’t let you walk away
I can’t let you walk away
You need to light one with me
