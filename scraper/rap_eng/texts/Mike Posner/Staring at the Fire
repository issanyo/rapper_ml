[Verse 1]
I've always had trouble staying still
I stand next to what I hate just for the thrill
Spent the first quarter of my life on a million dollar bill
'Cause I can't stop staring at the fire
We got our crosses and our buildings, built 'em tall
And my book's another brick inside the wall
We sure make ourselves feel busy, but we don't do much at all
Except sit around and stare at the fire
And the protesters have gathered in the streets
Opposite, a block full of police
But they both have the same problem with God as you and me
It's that they can't stop staring at the fire

[Chorus]
Watch it burn, burn, burn
Watch it burn, burn, burn
Watch it burn, burn, burn
Watch it burn, burn, burn

[Verse 2]
Went to an ashram a million miles from here
An old man on a blanket appeared
He waved me to come closer, and he whispered in my ear
"Son, you've got to stop staring at the fire"
But all my ego trips come in flocks
And they tell me, "Kid, it's really not that hot"
Take your anxiety and your guilt, just throw it all on top
Now I can't stop standing in the fire

[Chorus]
Oh, watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Oh, watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
