I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That after all these years I'd still be calling you
To try to sell you on the thought of coming back to me

Baby girl, yeah, you were my first
But you've always been my favorite girl
And I just so happened to break up with my latest girl
So I think you should come over and be my latest girl
Latest girl

All I know is I still feel the same way
That I felt so long ago
And even though I fuck other girls
Now I don't want them, so
We can pretend that were right back in 2000 yo
2000 yo, hey, hey

Everybody knows I'm still not over you
Not over you
And every time I lose a girlfriend
I call you, yeah, I call you

Walk with me, I made a few more beats
Since the last time you done talk to me
I got a few more connects in the game
But that's not all I need

Remember back in the day
You had a massive phone bill
From calling me
Why you stop calling me?

Remember, babe
I wrote you all those love notes in 7th grade
And I hope you threw those out
When we went out separate ways
'Cause I don't want to see them up for sale on eBay
Don't put them on eBay, hey, hey

Everybody knows I'm still not over you
Not over you
And every time I lose a girlfriend
I call you, yeah, I call you

You were my first girl
So won't you be my last girl?
Hey, first girl
Won't you be my last girl?

You were my first girl
So won't you be my last girl?
Hey, first girl
Won't you be my last girl?

Everybody know I'm still not over you
Not over you
And every time I lose a girlfriend
I call you, yeah, I call you
