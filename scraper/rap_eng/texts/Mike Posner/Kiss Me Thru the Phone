[Chorus]
Baby, I know that you lying, probably gon deny it
I know that you scheming when you say you going home
You think you can hide it, he calls you up on private
If your not with him now then baby kiss me through the phone
Swear your all alone, than kiss me thru the phone, or I'm gon leave you all alone

I bet right now you think your so smooth
You be running round town with your old dude
I?m not gonna act like I can?t see, when you come back home you won?t find me
I'ma be up late with my old girl, phone will be on silent

[Chorus]
Don't try to play like I don?t know you, I already called up ?!, dat's my go to, I?m not gonna act like I can?t see, when you get back home you won?t find me, I'ma be up late with my old girl, yeah, you think you so slick, you make me so sick

[Chorus]
[Saigon]
Mwah, why can?t you give me a kiss
If you alone why don't you kiss me through the phone, mwah, if I don?t get it miss you officially on your own, and if you considering twittering I gon be bitter then, it?s nobody?s business but ours, shh, let me finish my bars, lately you been in your own world, say you with your home girl but Malika told me she ain?t seen you so I text, nothing disrespectful, just something let you know, you can cu cu cut da bullshit, cut da bullshit, kiss me through the jack now, who that in the background, you said its your cousins uncles brother, but how does that sound? ok if you stating the truth then kiss me through the phone, I?ll be waiting for the proof

[Chorus]
