[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Today was gonna be the day they were gonna give it back to you
But by now you shoulda somehow realize what you gotta do
And I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...

[Hook: Mike Posner]
I said maybe...
You gonna be the one that saves me
And after all...
You're my wonderwall

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
And I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...know how

[Hook: Mike Posner]
I said maybe...
You gonna be the one that saves me
And after all...
You're my wonderwall

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
Big KRIT shorty!
They say you never let me free and I should tear you down
But you protect me from my failures when they come around
I build you up to be the best that you could be
But every now and then you block the sun and make it hard to see
Whatever's in front of me well surely I never climb
Hoping what I've created from fear would slip behind
But, you know the do's and dont's, been down this boulevard
A broken dream's amongst thing that would tear us both apart
Start over and over to make it through
Safe to say that nobody can see what I see in you
But when it all falls down you know and I know it too
As long as you never move of course we can never lose
Battles between nightmares and dreams and such
It was a time they used to say I often dreamed too much
About the maybes and the ifs too busy wishin' on a star
But with you here's not that hard, good Lord

[Hook: Mike Posner]
I said maybe...
You gonna be the one that saves me
And after all...
You're my wonderwall
