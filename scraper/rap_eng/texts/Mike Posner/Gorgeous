[Chorus: blackbear]
Did you know you're on fire?
Did you know that you're beautiful?
Did you know you got me fucked up?
Did you know that you're gorgeous?

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Alright, I can still remember how the weed smelled
When you were riding shotgun, no seat belt
Or the SS just taking hits
Sold that car and fucked up that relationship
I've built up my walls perhaps too tall
Got issues with trusting but that's not all
Knots tied by fame and not easily undone
I fucked 200 women, said, "I love you" to one
She used to speak like she was reading a scene
And make love like she was a martyr
The only thing about flames that bright
Is they tend to make mine seem darker

[Chorus: blackbear]
Did you know you're on fire?
Did you know that you're beautiful?
Did you know you got me fucked up?
Did you know that you're gorgeous?
Did you know that you're
Did you know that you're gorgeous?
Did you know that you're
Did you know that you're gorgeous?

[Verse 2: blackbear]
Yeah, yeah, in and out of love
On and off of drugs
I ask you where you've been
And you give me shoulder shrugs
Pink polka dot top from Saint Laurent
I bought you but you never wore it
And I don't even send the text
I know you just ignore it
And I'm so high
Could be the drugs, could be the moment
But either way I can't keep my eyes off of you

[Chorus: blackbear]
Did you know you're on fire?
Did you know that you're beautiful?
Did you know you got me fucked up?
Did you know that you're gorgeous?
Did you know that you're
Did you know that you're gorgeous?
Did you know that you're
Did you know that you're gorgeous?
