[Verse 1]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go out!
When you go to check the mail, I'd call and say "get home, NOW!"
Standing over your shoulder every time you pull your phone out
And if there's guys at work, you're not going, better call out!
Track, track everything you do
I heard your teacher's single, guess you're not going to school
I don't know about me, but I know about you
So I'm going home, you're staying in your room
Bye!

[Bridge]
I'm going to be, everywhere you go!
Hey girl... let me check your phone!

[Hook]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'll never be alone
I could be a gentleman, but I don't want to
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
And nobody would know

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you like, yeah I don't really care
I can be your Ted Bundy, hide you in my basement
I know your mom really wants you to visit for Christmas
But your brother is a guy, so sorry you're staying here
Boyfriend boyfriend, I'm your freaking boyfriend
Listen to what I say, or baby face the torment
And if you don't, listen close, this is important
Say goodbye to your parents, and get ready to be an orphan
Bye!

[Bridge]
I'm going to see, everything you do
Hey girl... who you talking to?!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So give me a chance, you're all I need girl
Spend a week with ya boy, have you calling law enforcement
Cause I am your man, I'm all you need girl
I just wanna hug and squeeze you tight

[Hook]
