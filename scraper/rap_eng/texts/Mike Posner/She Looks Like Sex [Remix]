[Intro: Mike Posner]

She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex

Sex, sex
She looks like sex
Sex, sex

[Verse 1: Puff Puff Humbert]

She looks like sex, maybe not yet, but don't fret
I bet if you get drunk suddenly you'll be dead set
On getting it in you mess with the gin
And you'll end up convinced you had sex with a ten

So full throttle, order another bottle
And shot after shot will transform her into a model
Mike Posner on the refrain
'Cause you know beer goggles are a hell of a thing

[Hook: Mike Posner]

That ass makes me wanna ooh-ooh-ooh
You know exactly what you do-o-o
How I'd really like to take that home
Everybody here knows

She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex

She looks like...

[Verse 2: Puff Puff Humbert]

When I crack a six pack and chase it with Patron
Every girl looks like Catherine Zeta-Jones
So I show up to the club, and I stand at the door
Waiting on the perfect girl whose standards are low

I take Jameson and take it with no shame
And change any dame to Jenna Jameson
Mike Posner on the Refrain, 'cause you know beer goggles are a hell of a thing

[Hook: Mike Posner]

That ass makes me wanna ooh-ooh-ooh
You know exactly what you do-o-o
How I'd really like to take that home
Everybody here knows

She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex

She looks like...

[Bridge: Mike Posner]

(Break it down!)

Sex

She looks...

Sex
Sex, Sex
Sex, Sex

She looks like sex
Sex, Sex
She looks like
