[Hook: Blackbear]
Even though it was long ago
I'm still caught up in the undertoe
And the waves come
Crashing over me
Cause I'm caught up in
Who I couldn't be

[Chorus: Blackbear]
Cause what you want
And what you need
Is a man that I could never be
And what you want
And what you need
Is anyone, anyone but me!

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Couple years older than me
Met you at duke
You were out of my league
I was dating Carolyne
At the time I met you
She done got a song
Now she doesn't get two (no)
Years disappear, years blow by
You fell in love with me
I don't know why
But every time I'm in the city
On tour
I pretend I'm your man
And for those hours
I'm yours
But you deserve better
We both know it
I fucking love you
I never showed it
Gone as soon as I came
Get a real guy baby
Anybody but me

[Chorus: Blackbear]
Cause what you want
And what you need
Is a man that I could never be
And what you want
And what you need
Is anyone, anyone but me!

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Remember you were out of my league
I've been hitting homers baby
Now I'm big leagues
I swear
Imma wife you up one day
But for now I just text you
When I'm on the runway
(Sorry)
Say I'm in town
You say for how long
Say I don't know
Some more small talk
I go to work for a while in the studio
When I'm done I'm gonna hit it like a groupie hoe
But you're not though
And we both know it
I fucking love you
I never show it
Gone, as soon as I came
Get a real guy baby
Anybody but me...

[Hook: Blackbear]
Even though it was long ago
I'm still caught up in the undertoe
And the waves come crashing over me
Cause I'm caught up in who i couldn't be...

[Chorus: Blackbear]
Cause what you want
And what you need
Is a man that I could never be
And what you want
And what you need
Is anyone, anyone but me!

[Verse 3: Blackbear]
A couple years ago
We had it all
It seems like almost every single day
I wanna pick up and call
Way back in the day
Before I learned to stand tall
I had to get my knees scraped
Before I learned to never fall
Cause you deserve better
Trust me I'd know
Sometimes I hate you
Sometimes I hope it shows
And you deserve anybody but me
Cause what you want and what you need
Are two completely different things
Cause what you want
And what you need
And what you want
And what you need
Is anyone, anyone but me!
