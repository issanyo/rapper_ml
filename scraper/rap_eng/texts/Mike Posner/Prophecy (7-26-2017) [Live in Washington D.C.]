It's ok, you can just listen to this part

We walk inside packed rooms
And get the hands up like statues
Me and James, we ain't got no home to go back to
But who needs a home when you got a family?
When you got the microphone, who needs a Grammy?
Poetry written underneath a groupie
Fast forward two hours I'm on stage screaming,
"Who you gonna substitute me with?"
Another sheet of loose leaf, rich
Another pair of blue jeans, stripped
Balled up in the corner of the back lounge
Evidence of a commitment to never back down
The spoils of victory-
I went from class clown to king! king! king!
You could see me I'm in the black crown
And I smell good too

We out here, we're talking 'bout prophecy
Prophecy, on my mind constantly
People get rich when they take the time to copy me
Mike Posner's Odyssey, don't forget the apostrophe
My prerogative is to shine bright baby, no Bobby B
I got a new philosophy: honesty, honesty
Do whatever you feel and offer no apology
Make some damn noise I want this night in my biography!

I said make some damn noise I want this night in my biography!
Make some damn- no, I want every night in my biography
Make it a million pages long, we made it here impossibly
[?]
You show our velocity
Mama are you watching me?
Uncle Fred are you watching me?
Stewie are you watching me?
David Foster Wallace are you watching me?
We rocked every arena in this country, no choreography
I said we rocked every arena in this country, no choreography

It's hard to be a prodigy in a democracy
People don't really care about equality
As long as they got their shopping sprees
Right?
But I tell you something else,
I'd rather earn another million dollars than wake up and win the lottery
My bibliography will be one word long: God
We talkin' 'bout prophecy
Prophecy, on my mind constantly
If we're considering real shit the Mike Posner Band gotta be
On the tip of your tongue
When I listen to one
Let me cool off

Y'all doing alright over here?
We're on a world tour
We are chasing something
Something ineffable, a feeling
You get it when everyone's listening, form the front row to the ceiling
Anyone had one of those moments where everything just sorta makes sense? Say yeah
It's better than sex, it's better than drugs, it's true
"You don't wanna be high like me"
Maybe I was wrong- you do
'Cuz I got the feeling right now D.C!
Do you?
I said I got the feeling right now, do you?
I got the feeling right now! Do you?
Put your hands together for the Mike Posner Band

Talkin' 'bout prophecy, prophecy
On my mind constantly
Bibliography will be one word long: God
