Chorus:
It feels like I'm running on walls
And I don't want to touch the ground
If they say that I'm lost
Then I don't want to be found
It feels like I'm running on walls
And I don't want to touch to the ground
If they say that I'm lost
Then I don't want to be found
I'm on mirrors edge

Verse:
Stuck in a dream, but I can't wake up
Sitting in a bank, but I can't take up
Don't want my girl, but I can't break up
Cuz my every day life, I don't want to shake up
Feel the earth wake up
Won't stay still
Haters all around, but I won't stay trill
All up in my face trying to show their skill
Say they don't love, but I know they will
Before the show is over and the lights go out
After I rec on the mic show out
Married to the mob, so wives throw out
Game all over that's right blow out
What you know about getting raise
We'd done thought of life fifteen ways
So blaze up the end oh
While I'm sitting on the ceiling with the j's on the window

Chorus:
It feels like I'm running on walls
And I don't want to touch the ground
If they say that I'm lost
Then I don't want to be found
It feels like I'm running on walls
And I don't want to touch to the ground
If they say that I'm lost
Then I don't want to be found
I'm on mirrors edge

Versus:
Escalade, get paid
Nigga had to learn from mistakes I made
Daddy coudln't teach me he was layin in the grave
I did a little dirt
Hope God forgave
Now tell momma I'm on my way
Tell me where she be her best
Got me out the hood, I recess
Ii smoke a lil weed to relieve my stress
Stackin 'em, makin out to perfect
I got a new cadi out of my first bitch, persist
Lil purple
Seven in the alley, I took that risk
Runnin in a circle
Runnin out of town
South side nigga just wanna flip me
Rich mothafucker that's all that is
I survived that now I feel like this

Chorus:
It feels like I'm running on walls
And I don't want to touch the ground
If they say that I'm lost
Then I don't want to be found
It feels like I'm running on walls
And I don't want to touch to the ground
If they say that I'm lost
Then I don't want to be found
I'm on mirrors edge

Bridge:
Looking out the window at another city's lights
Trying to make it home on another lonely flight
Because I'm runnin, runnin trying to find my way
But there's nothing, nothing, nothing
I can say to find you
I'm on mirrors edge

Versus:
Mirros on my walls
In my new apartment
I never touch the floor
I'm like a Aladdin's carpet
I'm feeling like a star
But I'm remaining car less
Cuz I can run on walls like I am Lucy Ballise
They be saying I'm the next
And I'm just hoping that is true
I took my number got in line
Just hoping I ain't number two
So, you ask how I feel. I'm fine
You ask about the deal in time
Cuz the boy from kansas ran on the ground
On enough now...

Chorus:
It feels like I'm running on walls (yeah)
And I don't want to touch the ground
I don't want to touch the ground
(That's what it is and that's what it will be)
If they say that I'm lost
Then I don't want to be found
Don't find me, don't find me
It feels like I'm running on walls
And I don't want to touch to the ground. (alright, alright)
If they say that I'm lost
Then I don't want to be found
I'm on mirrors edge
I'm on mirrors edge
I'm on mirrors edge
I'm on mirrors edge
