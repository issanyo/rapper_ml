[Verse 1]
Somebody told me God is simply what we don't know
Saw a butterfly, it was dead, but it was gorgeous
And all the robots are just walkin' down the sidewalk
Kings and their little empires that they made up

[Chorus]
And I'm wide open
And I'm wide open

[Verse 2]
Dusty got shot, and then Osha got married
Stewie still dead, and commitment still scary
I got a new woman, but I treat her like my old one
If I keep this shit up, I know I'ma be with no one

[Chorus]
And I'm wide open
Yeah, I'm wide open
