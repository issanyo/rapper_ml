[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I cleaned out your dresser, found some joints
My sister smoked 'em, I didn’t see the point
And everyone keeps sayin' that I look just like you
Life don't seem so alone anymore

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
The day my daddy died, I damn near quit the band
The day my daddy died, I held my mama’s hand
I cried my tears, then dried 'em up
Put my face inside my hands
The day my daddy died, I became a man

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
The cops came, they did not take off their shoes
People hug me, I smell like 10,000 perfumes
Gave away the wheelchair, you're gone, but I'm still here
January in Detroit is cold as fuck

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
The day my daddy died, I damn near quit the band
The day my daddy died, I held my mama's hand
I cried my tears, then dried 'em up
Put my face inside my hands
The day my daddy died, I became a man
The day my daddy died, I became a man

[Outro: Mike Posner & Jon Posner]
I love you a lot
I love you, too
Remind me to let you run away if you need to run places, like the basement. I mean, that's what it's a part of, isn’t it? Being an individual
Yeah, letting people go
Yeah
Remind me to let you go, too, if you need to
Absolutely
I love you
I love you so much. You’re gonna put that into a song?
