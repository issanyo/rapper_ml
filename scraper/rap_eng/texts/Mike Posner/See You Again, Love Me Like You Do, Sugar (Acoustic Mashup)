[Intro]
Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do
To-to, touch me like you do
Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do

[Verse 1]
You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
(I don't wanna be needing your love)
Never knew that it could mean so much
(I just wanna be deep in your love)
So much

[Verse 2]
You're the fear, I don't care
Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
(Cause I really don't care where you are)
You can see the world you brought to life
(I just wanna be there where you are)
To life

[Verse 3]
Your sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me
I'm right here
Cause I need, little love and little sympathy

[Verse 4]
I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving, I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging, I'm on my knees
(I'll let you set the pace)
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

[Verse 5]
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

[Outro]
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh...
So let the light guide your way
Yeah, hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home, home
(Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do)
Your sugar
(Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do) Yes, please
It's been a long day without you my friend
Yeah, you show me good loving make it all right
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again, when I see you again
