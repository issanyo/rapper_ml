[Verse 1]
You might have heard about me, heard I got raw instrumentals
Ignore me in the hall when you saw me in my trenchcoat
Shrugged me off when I was rappin' in the cypher
Assumed I was dumb in class 'cause I was actin' hyper
Well let the ambiguity cease, there's no awkwardness now
It's just you and me, and I produce all these beats so just close your eyes
You give me sixty minutes and I'll blow your mind
From the depths of my depression kicked toes in the wall
To the time I fought TJ, and called on EJ
The tales of a lost teen, I'm here in my basement
Almost eighteen, wondering where the days went
Staring at blankness about to attack like, rarely complacent
Let me tell you what that's like
You can call me underground as long as you call me sincere
Not only am I coming out I feel like I've always been here

[Chorus]
I'm one
As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this

As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this

[Bridge]
Imma just like on my back looking at the sky
And then go in the park enchanted by the kids passing by
Actually, yeah I wrote this in my basement sober
Oh good, a less poetic a lot more Mike Posner

[Verse 2]
For everybody that's fed up with teachers and parents
Mad middle class, high school students embarrassed
For everybody frustrated with the opposite sex
Who regret it when he sees him with no confidence left
I put music in it that you weren't expecting
So kids who hate rap can maybe respect this
Only intelligent kids can handle Mike's shit
Name another rapper rapping over pianos like this
I'm something else, new wave, original
Fuck a punch line, everything I say is literal
Black t-shirts, grey sweats, and green eyes
I don't fit in with other kids and I bet you see why
I'm an awkward kid that if you know in advance
My goal is to steal half a bed full his fans
An' they no got you a musical pioneer
And guess what else?
(What what what)
I'm here

[Chorus]
I'm here
As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this

As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this

[Verse 3]
The more they see its not about runnin" round with the in crowd
The more I see they only say it 'cause they're not in it
Why take direction from a teacher, port-a-potty of society, end up like him?
Fuck that, an' I am me
Life's a big high school: you cool or not?
Another cool did time, I schooled the thought
Whether you new or not I give you food for thought
But I lose a lot of trust, trying to prove I'm hot
'Cause in real life I'm awkward, anti-social, self-conscience, intellectually advanced, emotional
But my raps give me a chance to be boastful 'cause I know I'm sweet
Well actually I'm hopeful
Now surely you'll react 'cause I don't rap for you
I write to myself and that's that, it's through
The bass shakes my walls and my ceiling darks
I'm here feel that energy building up
Come on

[Chorus]
I'm here
As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this

As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this
