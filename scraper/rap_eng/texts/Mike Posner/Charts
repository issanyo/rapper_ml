Charts

I did interviews in London
A song I wrote is the number one song in all of the UK
People tell me 'Congrats'
Meanwhile in LA, Matt is going back to the hospital
In his words he needs a doctor who specialises in rockstars whose organs are failing
He drank too many drinks
Snorted too many drugs
Swallowed too many pills
He has a room at the Roosevelt
He's alone

I'm sitting in first class on a virgin flight back to America
My song is the number one song in all of the UK
And I don't give a fuck
