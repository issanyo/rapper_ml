[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Let's go back, I know it's been a minute
But I can do it better than I did when I did it
You were loving me, I was loving you
You can come over and we can have Déjà Vu
We could have Déjà Vu
You could come over and...

[Verse 1: Mike Posner & (Boyz II Men)]
I’m probably gonna compliment your hair-do
Right before we mess that shit all up (mess that shit all up)
I used to keep you out way pass your curfew
Look at me now, I'm all grown up (look at me now, I'm grown up)
She was reminiscing in her mind
I'm just tryna make up for lost time
But we acting nervous
'Cause we've been here before

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Let's go back, I know it's been a minute
But I can do it better than I did when I did it
You were loving me, I was loving you
You can come over and we can have Déjà Vu
We could have Déjà Vu
You could come over and...

[Verse 2: Mike Posner & (Boyz II Men)]
I'm probably gonna complement your outfit (your outfit)
Right before you take that shit all off (take that shit all off)
Member we would sneak out of our houses? (our houses)
Look at us now, we're all grown up (yeah baby, look at us now, we're grown up)
She was reminiscing in her mind
I'm just trying to make up for lost time
But we acting nervous
'Cause we've been here before

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Let's go back, I know it's been a minute
But I can do it better than I did when I did it
You were loving me, I was loving you
You can come over and we can have Déjà Vu
We could have Déjà Vu
You could come over and...

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Nothing much has changed
You still feel the same
Don't pretend that you don't want to like I do
I know you think about
What it would feel like now
Come over, let's make a new memory

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Let's go back, I know it's been a minute
But I can do it better than I did when I did it
You were loving me, I was loving you
You can come over and we can have Déjà Vu
We could have Déjà Vu
You could come over and...
