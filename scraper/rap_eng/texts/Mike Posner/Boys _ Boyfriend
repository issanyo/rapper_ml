Artie:
For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand
I'm so glad we're at the same place
At the same time

Blaine (Artie):
It's over now
I spotted you dancin'
You made all the boys stare
Those lips and your brown eyes (Oooh)
And the sexy hair

Artie (Blaine):
I should shake my thang (Uh)
Make the world want you (Hahaha)
Tell your girls you'll be back
I wanna see what you can do

Artie and Blaine with New Directions Boys:
What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryin' to sound conceited but
You and me were meant to be
You're a sexy girl, I'm a nice guy
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world!

Blaine with New Directions:

Imma a make you shine bright like you’re laying in the snow burr!

Blaine:

You could be my girlfriend until the world ends
Make you dance do a spin and a twirl and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook (New Directions Boys: If I was your boyfriend) like a whirl wind, swaggie
