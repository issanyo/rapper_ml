[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Bet your window's rolled down and your hair is pulled back
Bet you got no idea that you’re going too fast
You’re trying not to think about what went wrong
You’re trying not to stop until you get where you’re going
You’re trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

[Bridge]
I can’t live without you, I can never doubt you baby
I can’t never doubt you, I can’t live without you baby, baby

[Hook]
The highway won’t hold you tonight
The highway don’t know you’re alive
The highway don’t care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won’t dry your tears
The highway don’t need you here
The highway don’t care if you’re coming home
But I do, I do

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Bet you got a dead cellphone on your shotgun seat
And I bet you’re all up in God's ear talking about me
You’re trying not to let the first tear fall down
You’re trying not to think about turning around
You’re trying to get lost so you turn on the radio
And the song goes

[Bridge]
I can’t live without you, I can never doubt you baby
I can’t never doubt you, I can’t live without you baby, baby

[Chorus}
The highway won’t hold you tonight
The highway don’t know you’re alive
The highway don’t care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won’t dry your tears
The highway don’t need you here
The highway don’t care if you’re coming home
But I do, I do
I do, I do (x3)
Alright, yeah
