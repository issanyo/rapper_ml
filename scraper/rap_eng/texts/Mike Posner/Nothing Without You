[Verse 1]
I pretend I'm a happy, lying man
But it's easy to learn when I don't understand
Never thought I'd be running back so soon
But I don't believe in nothing without you
There's a part of me hoping there's a chance
That you'll look in these eyes and hold these hands
I don't care about finding someone new
Cause I don't believe in nothing without you

[Chorus]
Thought I had nothing to lose
Thought I had nothing to prove to you
And I wasted all this time, I'm sorry
Funny only now I know it's true
Baby, I got nothing without you

[Verse 2]
Since you left, I'm a cartoon of myself
I'm a mess, I'm a joke, I'm someone else
I keep telling this story like it's bad news
Cause I don't believe in nothing without you, oh

[Chorus]
Thought I had nothing to lose
Thought I had nothing to prove to you
And I wasted all this time, I'm sorry
Funny only now I know it's true
Baby, I got nothing without you

[Verse 3]
I know that I'm a gamble
I know that it's a long shot
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I do everything I can't do
Cause you're everything that I got, I got

[Chorus]
Thought I had nothing to lose
Thought I had nothing to prove to you
And I wasted all this time, I'm sorry
Funny only now I know it's true
Baby, I got nothing without you

[Outro]
And I wasted all this time, I'm sorry
Funny only now I know it's true
Baby, I got nothing without you
