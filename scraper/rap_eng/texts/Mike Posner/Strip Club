[Intro: Mike Posner]
I'm goin' to the strip club
'Round and 'round she spins
I'm goin' to the strip club
'Round and 'round again

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I'm throwin' 100's and them 50's
I got a fuckin' stack and its stashed in my Dickie's
You know how we do, ayy
My beard's long like a hippie
I'm just like a rapper, I got Finally Famous with me
'Cause that's my fuckin' crew
And you can look, you can hate if you want to
But everything's gonna be alright
For my team and my crew and my hometown
I'ma do it real big tonight

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
I'm goin' to the strip club (strip club)
'Round and 'round she spins
I'm goin' to the strip club (strip club)
'Round and 'round again
I'm goin' to the strip club (strip club)
'Round and 'round she spins
And I know it ain't right, but for just one night
I'ma flex with all of my friends

[Verse 2: Blackbear & Mike Posner]
Yeah, I might fuck around and pop a blue
Wear my swishies to the strippy
Got a hundred blue notes in my pockets, is you with me?
And I'm with Mike Pos' and he still wearin' Dickie's
Take a private dance, but I never let 'em kiss me
And I got that cabernet up in my cup, that sippy, sippy
That Jesus juice, I'm feelin' loose, I'm feelin' kinda trippy
Just took a hit of LSD, oh man, I'm in the club
Haters talk shit, but they gets no love
Got my fellas to the left, honeys on my right
Order hundred bottles, sparklin', sparklin'
Come and sit with me, anything you like
Order it up, girl, I got you
We goin' to the strip club

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Strip club
'Round and 'round she spins
I'm goin' to the strip club (strip club)
'Round and 'round again
I'm goin' to the strip club (strip club)
'Round and 'round she spins
And I know it ain't right, but for just one night
I'ma flex with all of my friends

[Verse 3: Mike Posner & Blackbear]
It's fuckin' poetry how she pole dance
You should come and do that shit up on Pos' pants
Bring them hoes, reach your toe, tell 'em hold hands
We just wanna fuck, no slow dance, romance
She popped it real fast and then she did it slow, slow, slow
She backed it up on Bear and she had him like, "Woah, woah, woah"
And I dress and I look and I smell good
So everything's gonna be alright
For my team and my crew and my hometown
I'ma do it real big tonight

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
I'm goin' to the strip club (strip club)
'Round and 'round she spins
I'm goin' to the strip club, strip club (strip club)
'Round and 'round again
I'm goin' to the strip club (strip club)
'Round and 'round she spins
And I know it ain't right, but for just one night
I'ma flex with all of my friends
I'ma stunt with all of my friends
I'ma flex with all of my friends
I'ma stunt with all of my.... friends
