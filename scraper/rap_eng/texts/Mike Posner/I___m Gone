[Chorus]
I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

[Verse 1]
I'm leavin'
I'm gone
Please miss me
I'm almost done talkin'
Come on keep listening
This may be the last verse I ever rap out
No sweatpants now this one with the cap and gown
Graduated from high school
Graduated from rapping
Graduated from parents and graduated from you faggots
Graduated from track and basketball
Graduated from weed, now I've got Adderall
I'm goin' to college where the weather is nice
You gonna listen to this and remember me like
That was a weird kid I saw him rappin' thought I knew him
In ten years I wonder what's ever gonna happen to him
But I made it through eighteen years
I raise the champagne glass and I say to my peers
"I'm gone, happy it's over glad it was fun
Party one last time yo this chapter is done
Cos after today this is my life
You not gon hear from me again you better listen to my rhymes
There's nothing left here for me to put into my music
I'll go to college start over come back with some new shit"

[Chorus]
I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

[Verse 2]
Blue skies, puffy clouds
Sixty minutes later, you heard enough from me now
Cuban in my mouth I've got you smokin' with me
This is my coming of age, live this moment with me
Nobody's flawless like I want my girl to be
But what I've realised is you people mean the world to me
Without you I'd have noone to make fun of and tease
Without your stupidity I could never be genius
In the winter that concept was so far fetched
Now I am [?]
I say goodbye to my closest of brothers
Sayonara to high school, adios to my mother
Retire the notepad imma miss these raps
And the librarians at school can kiss my ass
Before I leave we'll sit down and have a beer or two
But if not, I'll just see you next year at Duke

[Chorus]
I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

[Outro]
Reflections of a lost teen
Reflections of a lost teen
Reflections of a lost teen
Reflections of a lost teen
Reflections of a lost teen
Reflections of a lost teen
Reflections of a lost teen
Reflections of a lost teen

Haha I didn't mean to sound like an asshole with the last line
I didn't mean to come off pompous or arrogant but
It's just like I made it
I'm leaving here with[?]
Next year I'll be in the Sarah P. Duke Gardens, google that shit
Throwin' the frizbee around
You know I'm never coming back right?
I mean I'll be back on holidays for the first couple of years but
I'm never coming back
Peace

Life goes on
