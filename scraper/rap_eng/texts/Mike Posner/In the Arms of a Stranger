[Verse 1]
I was 16 with a rocket
And some sunshine in my pocket
It was how you used words I didn't know
And the way you said my name
And cut up peaches and them brown eyes
Lit a flame up that we pretend doesn't glow

[Pre-Chorus]
You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

[Chorus]
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm locked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

[Verse 2]
There were times I think about us
Overcome by the nostalgias
I am on call when you need me, let me know
But we're drifting in a strange way
I'm aware that it's mistake if I love you
It's a mistake if I don't

[Pre-Chorus]
You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

[Chorus]
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm locked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

[Bridge]
And she smelled like Michigan
And it felt like lust
And the nostalgia's killing me
And it's all because

[Chorus]
I'm in the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm locked up
In the arms of a stranger, stranger, stranger

In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm locked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
