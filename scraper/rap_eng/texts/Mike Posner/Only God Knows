[Chorus]
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows how hard I've been trying
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

[Verse 1]
"There's more to life than living", a wise man told me this
Or maybe it was me who wrote it, I can't remember which
In any case what I mean, life's an unfinished poem
Don't go mad trying to figure out the ending
The day that Norman died, I found out through an email
The irony of that, I will not discuss in detail
My future is on thin ice and my past is all online
But only God knows the trouble on my mind

[Chorus]
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows how hard I've been trying
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

[Verse 2]
My walls are filled with artwork, my art is filled with paint
My head is filled with big old thoughts of all the things I ain't
I bet you know what that's like, though you never drop your guard
Only God knows the places that you're scarred
I'm sitting on a park bench in the city I don't know
Trying to convince myself that I'm not all alone
But my immediate surroundings suggest otherwise
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

[Chorus]
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows how hard I've been trying
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows the trouble on my mind (mind)
Only God knows the trouble on my mind (on my mind)
Only God knows the trouble on my mind
