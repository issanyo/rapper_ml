[Verse 1]
I been drinking, I been smoking
I been waiting, I been hoping that there's still some chance
You and me can find a reason to believe in
All them weekends that we used to have

[Pre-Chorus]
You're pretending that you don't care
So I'm doing the same
I love you more when you're taken
Oh Lord, you're good at this game

[Chorus]
Don't do me dirty, show me some mercy
Darling, please lay down your weaponry
How did we end up somewhere between a
Lover and a memory?
'Cause I don't believe in a halfway heart
And you gave me all of my favorite scars
How did we end up somewhere between a
Lover and a memory?

[Post-Chorus]
Lover and a memory
Lover and a memory

[Verse 2]
Watched you do this, treat me ruthless, make excuses
When the truth is that the thoughts still come
Now in then when you're in private
You can sit up in the silence, and it sounds like drums

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm pretending I don't care
So you're doing the same
You like me more when I'm taken
Oh Lord, I'm good at this game

[Chorus]
Don't do me dirty, show me some mercy
Darling, please lay down your weaponry
How did we end up somewhere between a
Lover and a memory?
'Cause I don't believe in a halfway heart
And you gave me all of my favorite scars
How did we end up somewhere between a
Lover and a memory?

[Post-Chorus]
Lover and a memory
Lover and a memory
