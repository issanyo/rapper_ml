When I was 21 I met Kanye
I was really excited because I was a struggling musician
He was one of my heroes,
And I knew if he liked my music he could change my life

My friend Big Sean introduced us
Then Sean played him a song of mine
"Kanye, this is Mike. He made the song you just heard."
And he said, "Cool!" and gave me a fist bump
Awkward silence ensued
So I said, "did you like it?"
He said to me, "no."
And he wasn't being mean he was just being honest
He's not the kind of guy to tell you he likes something when he doesn't think it's good
And I must have been wearing my broken heart on my face
Because he said to me, "sorry, sorry man."

Sean bumped it, you set it, I had to spike it
And in that moment all I wanted to do was make more music
I couldn't wait
So that's exactly what I did
It lit a fire up in me!
It lit a fire up in me!
It lit a fire up in me!
And no setback,
No hater hiding behind a keyboard,
No member of the press,
No sickness in the family,
No bodily injury,
No bad day,
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing could ever burn out
Massey's on my side, it's my turn now
We're going straight to the top boys
Buckle them seatbelts, hop on this back right here
I don't need help!

I didn't come here to tell you that I can do some things that you can't do
I didn't come to change you
I came to tell you that if you look deep enough inside, underneath the curfews, perfumes, etc.
I bet you'd find a flame too

I want to thank you for having us
We're the Mike Posner Band
Oh yeah, and I saw Kanye a few years later at the EMAs
And he said, "Mike Posner, I really like some of your songs."
