Hello, you are about to listen to A Real Good Kid. The album is 40 minutes long and is meant to be listened to in one sitting, straight through. It is meant to be listened to without texting, without emailing, without outside distraction of any sort. If at this time you are unable to devote 40 minutes of undivided attention, I politely ask you turn this off and return at a later time.

It's hard to describe how I feel right now. People keep asking what happened to me. What happened to me? The answer is this.
