[Chorus]
Put all your stuff in a box in my room
Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Since you've been gone, ain't got nothin' to do
I sleep until noon, I wake up and feel bad
I think I miss somethin' I never had
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna unwind, unwind
Everything that makes me feel confined
Sometimes, I hate sunshine
Sometimes, I hate sunshine
I just wanna unwind, unwind
Everything that makes me feel confined
Sometimes, I hate sunshine
Sometimes, I hate sunshine

[Chorus]
Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
All your love letters and a pair of Ray-Bans
I'm growin' my beard, movin' back in my van
Your side of the bed still smells like you though
And these memories of us, it's brutal
You know, you know exactly how I feel
We broke up, but you be on my mind still
And the worst type of sadness you could have
Is when you miss somethin' that doesn't miss you back

[Chorus]
Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Outro]
I just wanna unwind, unwind
Everything that makes me feel confined
Sometimes, I hate sunshine
Sometimes, I hate sunshine
