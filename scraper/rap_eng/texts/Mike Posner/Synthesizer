Fake your way through a conversation
Tell her all the things you wish were true
Maybe you're the voice of a generation
And a princess somewhere waits for you

But if you're never gonna change the world
If you're never gonna be a movie star
If you're never gonna change the world
Maybe you're looking too hard

Don't synthesizer her
Don't redesign her
She's no prize for
A synthesizer

Pretend you meet your own expectations
Add another name below your list
Maybe you're the next world wide sensation
You probably know a thousand ones like this

But if you're never gonna change the world
If you're never gonna be a movie star
If you're never gonna change the world
Maybe you're looking too hard

Don't synthesizer her
Don't redesign her
She's no prize for
A synthesizer

Who you gonna call when the spotlight flickers
What you gonna do when your curtain falls
Maybe you can make them not remember her
Maybe you won't end up alone

Don't synthesizer her
Don't redesign her
She's no prize for
A synthesizer
