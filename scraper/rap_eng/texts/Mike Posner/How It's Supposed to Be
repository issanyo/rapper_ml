[Verse 1]
I think I'll buy a gun and blame it on my hometown
It’s so cold in the deep
She asked me if I think I'll ever see her again
I say, "Hopefully"

[Refrain]
And maybe that's how it’s supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be

[Verse 2]
My heroes all died young, they hung themselves with fame
And these lunatics, molded me
I got a tattoo, it's a joke I keep a secret
I need everyone to notice me

[Refrain]
But maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be
Maybe that's how it’s supposed to be

[Chorus 1]
I think I'll die young with all my broken dreams
I've got it figured out, this is the golden key
Everything is how it's supposed to be
Everything is how it’s supposed to be

[Verse 3]
We messed it all up, now the world is getting warmer
L.A. will be out at open sea
Meanwhile, I'm falling down, my heart is getting colder
I hurt everyone close to me

[Refrain]
But maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be (Hey)

[Chorus 2]
I think I'll die young with all my broken dreams
I've got it figured out, this is the golden key
The day my daddy died, I was down the street
I lost my only friend; people don't grow on trees
But maybe that's the way it's supposed to be
Yeah, I think that's the way it's supposed to be
Yeah, everything is how it's supposed to be
See, I think that's the way it's supposed to be (Ahh)

[Bridge]
Woah-woah
Woah-woah
Woah-woah

[Refrain]
See, I think that's the way it's supposed to be
Yeah, I think that's the way it's supposed to be
Everything is how it's supposed to be
I think this is how it's supposed to be

[Outro]
Well, here we are. This is Sunday morning, October 2, 1988, and this is Versagio and Lira. Versagio who I talked to last night wanted to see Michael, so there he is. Let's see if we can get him—Michael, look up here! Where you goin', Michael? Yeah, okay. Anyway, he is a real good kid.
