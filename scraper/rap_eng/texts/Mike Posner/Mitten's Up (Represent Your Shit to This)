[intro]
Like a waterfall in slow motion
(Alright)
Like a map with no ocean
(Bei Maejor, Southfield, Elzhi & McFly)

[Hook] [Mike Posner]:
I'm still tryna to do it big for my home town
When I'm back we can go all night
Let me see those mittens up, mittens up in the sky

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]:
Let em clear my throat uh
Somebody take my coat alright
Got the... to the game oh good
I've been running around... down givin em on the fake number
Apologies for that (I'm sorry) I gotta keep my suitcase packed
You can add it to the arsenal
Kobain Donnie Darko flow
Hey lady, I didn't catch your name lady
Let me do it to you good all night
Cause the nose ring might as well be a bulls eye
Let me clear my throat

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]:
The goal was to go and get Scott Storch doe
And stay away from Scott Storch clothes
Have I done yet not quite
I'm back in your city, never the same chick twice
Damn homie in high school you was the man homie
Damn, fuck happen to you
All my plaques just sittin in the closet
Cause I ain't have time to get in no spot yet
Don't I just glide on the beat
Ain't I so smooth on that motherfucka
Bingo
My mixtape shit going harder than your single
Let me clear my throat

[Verse 3: Elzhi]:
What up doe? Elzhi broadcasting live from the district. Motown, Great Lakes, Detroit stand up!
Could we be called the Motor City, cause we're living in the fast lane?
Get gas drivin a flash all of out cash gain
May die tryin to stay fly like a crashed plane
Tryin to get pass pain, doctor's splash rain on gash
Within your mass brain from a blast, now your ass slain
The whole hood is high on, pill, glass, 'caine
With many stuck, needles in they last vein
Sharp as a tuxedo when they clash in upper class Spain
And I ain't bullshittin'
The wolves gettin' inside of this wool mitten so cold
(Alright)
They growin' up near these auto industry entities
You instantly keep an eye on your role
Let me clear my throat

[Verse 4: Dusty McFly]:
D-town Westside
D-town Eastside
Look,look
Dirty blood
Mittens up,free wine,RIP blade,Bitches fuck, off our diamond Cartier shades
We call them buffs sybolize when we gettin paid
Some niggas took,some act though and wind in the grave
But look,i still love ice in my rollie (yeah)
Love my niggas posey (uh)
Love nights at the coney (yeah)
When I'm drunk off the rosie texting a cold ho
Telling her that i love her,but i really don't,doe
Let me clear my throat

[hook] x2

What up doe?

[outor]
Detroit stand up
313 is in the building
