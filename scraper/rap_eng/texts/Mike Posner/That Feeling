[Verse 1: Quez]
Uh, all I wanna do is take all my niggas to Vegas
Buy a pound of weed and smoke it, get them niggas faded
Yeah and buy some liquor man we gonna get wasted
Poppin' bottles on them hoes and tell them "Bitch we made it"
Yeah I wanna get a hundred grand of singles
Stack them shit so just like Pringles, thanking God I'm single
Yeah, ready to mingle though
I'm trying to slam dunk, yeah tryin' to finger row
You know that feeling feeling feeling like everything's changing
That feeling, feeling like you was instantly famous, feel that
Fuck that nigga, yeah I'ma kill that and y'all niggas don't know me
My team, we got that feeling, we need some fucking trophies

[Hook: Mike Posner & Travis Porter]
Uh, we do it for the whole team (uh-huh)
You know that feeling like you won a Superbowl ring (yeah)
We don't never get a day off (nah)
Make the city proud like we won the Playoffs
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling

[Verse 2: Ali]
I got this feeling, this feeling I know it
That I'm about to make some millions, some millions then blow it
My, my, my, my new bitch Brazilian, she gorgeous
This, this, this new life that I'm living it's hard to absorb it
Ever had that feeling when you pull out they say who that
New school, blue black, drop top, push back
It's Ali, yeah I knew that, blew the whole by 2 stacks
When I'm in the building, man them hoes run a full flat
Just some Puerto Ricos, margaritas, burritos
Vacation with my peoples, we do this for our people
You know that feeling like you won a Superbowl ring
No ball hog man I'm playing for the team, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Strap]
Feel on 24, jerk 'em to the right
Feeling like a Mo, look at me and all this ice
We're here for those how we roll, it's the feeling of a boss
I got trials on my line, got a million dollars house
We used to rot in Coogi sweaters now it's Gucci all the time
Freshen hair, leather season, wanna toll the summer time
Used to have a little bank roll now my bank roll larger
Transformer Camaro, hopped out the Dodge Charger
Gerry Guardian seats, green light slick rims
Check my ring out, oh I'm on my superbowl shit
I'm flat in the sky, I'm up there with the birds
I do it for the team, nigga, motherfuck what you heard

[Hook]
