I was born in Detroit on a very very very very very very very cold day
And most of my life since has been about trying to warm up
The big tour bus, money, more sluts, blood gore guts
I moved to LA seven years ago
In an honest attempt to do and get more stuff
Misson accomplished
Now what, what now
All I got is this money and this scepticism of love now
When you're up this high everyone just wants you to come down
Icarus problems, but at least the sun's out, right
At least the sun's out

A day loses to nightfall
I am right on the edge
I might fall
That's why it's fun for you to watch me
'Cause like all pretty things, I will end with no warning, apologis los siento, no merch, no momento
When god slows the tempo there will be no crescendo
This is real life it's not a game no Nintendo

Sacrifices made for an art that you can't touch
People think you're weird when you practice this much
That's how these six loners, became us
That's how these ten thousand people became us
That's how these ten thousand people became us

I'm movin' away, I'm selling my house
LA, this is my farewell poem
When I come back here, here will not be home

I'm goin' to chase something, and I think I'm getting close
I thought it was in this city but it's not
It's somewhere out on those roads
And at this very moment, the city's lights dim some
And my face is making the same face that everyone makes in LA
This one
