[Intro: 3OH!3]
Black dress with the tights underneath

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I've been feeling some type of way about her
Wanna wife her
Borderline I don't really like her
Cause she like to play around and she know she got it
In turn and make a kid not really want it
A bad bitch, who know she a bad bitch

Worst type in the world if you ask me
Worst thing in the world is emotions
So I'm sitting here trying to go through the motion
Get along but it'd be better if we boned
You don't understand, I don't need you honey
I beat my dick like I don't need money
She get around probably fuck yo homie
She text me then she probably gonna text Drake
Cause it be the ones man, with the pretty face
I guess it be the moon man who cracked the case

[Hook: 3OH!3] [x2]
She wants to touch me [Woah]
She wants to love me [Woah]
She'll never leave me [Woah, woah, oh, oh]
Don't trust a ho
Never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho
Won't trust me

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
She's a freshman, with a cup in her hand
She tries her best to pretend she doesn't know who I am
Her and her best friend, I seen em pull up they skirts
They got a wager to see who can hook up with me first
The threesome, like you ain't done it before
Oh you're a good girl, from high in his port
Well tell your boyfriend, if he even exists
He shouldn't trust you, because I'm stealing his bitch

[Kid Cudi]
Hey hater, sign language
Middle finger, middle finger
Let me tell you now
Intergalactical
I see them rockin the pole
I see them 304

[Hook: 3OH!3][x2]
She wants to touch me [Woah]
She wants to love me [Woah]
She'll never leave me [Woah, woah, oh, oh]
Don't trust a ho
Never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho
Won't trust me
