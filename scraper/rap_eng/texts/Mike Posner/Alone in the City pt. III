Alone in the City pt. III

I dip dive into a Michigan lake only to fly straight up
Water is dripping from my body like one of those corny glamour shots of a model getting out of a pool
Only it is not a corny glamour shot of a model getting out of a pool
It is real and it is me, flying straight up
When you're this high, the constellations of city lights are clearly path marks on Gods cheeks
That much is obvious to you
Why hadn't you seen it before? Too close?
Not close enough

The plane lands and a man waits for you at baggage claim
With your middle name on a sign
Your assistant has advised the driver to put your middle name on the sign instead of Posner
This way, fans won't suspect you are coming, congregate and ask for pictures and autographs upon your arrival
This is not actual problem in your life, fans almost never wait for you at airport baggage claims
This is a system you put in place for a problem you wished you had
The driver takes you to your parents house in the suburbs
Your mother answers the door, your father is in the hospital
He has a tumour the size of a tangerine lodged in his forehead
They're gonna cut his head open today and take the tumour out
Here you are again
Alone in the city
