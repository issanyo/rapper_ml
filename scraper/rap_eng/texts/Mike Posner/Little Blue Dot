Little Blue Dot

In Toronto it's freezing
In Honduras it's hot
In Detroit there's gun play
In Finland there's not
Our whole lives have been here so most of us forgot
If you look from the moon, we're just a little blue dot

We fight over money and women and land
We fight over ideas that we don't understand
We say that we're things we know that we're not
All part of the play on this little blue dot
