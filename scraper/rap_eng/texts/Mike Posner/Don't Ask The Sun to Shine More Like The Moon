Don't Ask The Sun to Shine More Like The Moon
Read by Dr. Wayne Dyer
Rest in Peace

'If I told you I believe in more than I can see,
Would you call me crazy?
If I said I could do anything I wanted to,
Would you say it's gone to my head?
If I told you I believed that you and I,
We are more than bundles of hearts and organs
We are notes from an organ with more keys than we can imagine
Strands in a spiderweb spinning through infinity
What would you think of me then?
Because I do and sometimes they try to change me to somebody new
To which I say, Don't ask the sun to shine more like the moon'
