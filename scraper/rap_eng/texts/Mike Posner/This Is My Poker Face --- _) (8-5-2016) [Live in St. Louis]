Are you entertained?
Are we everything you hoped for? Good.
Screams and smiles ain't really what we go for no more
Results in being in a cold war with my own ego

I'm floating on an ocean of solipsism, no shore
I gotta text from my ex
It said, "An artist, by definition, can never belong."
The bird does not sing because it has an answer
It sings because it has a song

Maybe my songs are songs,
And my microphone is pointing God's finger
Maybe I'm a prophet wearing the mask of a pop singer
Maybe I'm a sociopath, hoping the mainstream media picks me next
Maybe I'm a fake, I'm just here for the money and the free sex
Maybe I'm just tryna get my tour bus moving as fast as the Earth spins, but in the opposite direction,
So I finally feel like I'm standing still then

Maybe I'm on the brink of enlightenment
I'm David reincarnated
Maybe I just can't figure out how to separate
My love from my hate
Maybe my bar is too high
Thus my heart is still on the shelf
Maybe I'm just scared of putting time and commitment into anything but myself

Maybe beauty is more easily seen by the untrained eye
Maybe it's impossible to be a voice of a generation
And somebody's boyfriend at the same time

Maybe I'm headed for a disaster
I'm inching towards hell
Or maybe, I'm on the tip of something magnificent
Only time will tell

Maybe having no shtick has become my shtick
Maybe I only smile on stage-
And back there I'm a dick
Maybe I never took that pill in Ibiza- I made it up!
I know what sells, you're here
Maybe Mike Posner's a fake name, I'm really somebody else

Maybe I'm Illuminati
A mathematician, an engineer
Or maybe I really am Mike Posner!
One-sixth of the dopest fuckin' band you'll ever hear!

Maybe I'm what it looks like
When God moves at a slower pace
I'll never tell you who I really am
Because this... this, is my poker face
