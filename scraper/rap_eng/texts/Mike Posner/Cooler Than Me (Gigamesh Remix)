[Intro]
Designer shades just to hide [x8]

[Chorus]
Designer shades to hide your face
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
Its probably cuz
You think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1]
If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used to pull all my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me

[Chorus]
You got designer shades
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
It's probably cuz
You think you're cooler than me

[Outro]
Designer shades just to hide [x3]
Cooler than me [x2]
