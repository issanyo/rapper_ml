Cigarette
That I never got a chance to hit
A chance to hit
But in my mind
Baby I can taste your lips
Taste your lips

I was so foolish on some stupid shit
Should have never let you go, no
Knowing that you left messes with my head
Shadows of you haunt me now

So I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you
No I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you

Poured a glass
But I never got to take a sip
Take a sip
I've been around the world
But baby you're my only fix
My only fix

I was so foolish on some stupid shit
Should have never let you go no, no
Knowing that you left messes with my head
Shadows of you haunt me now

So I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you
No I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you

Had a heart attack
Full speed, swerve off track
Can't breathe, where you at where you at where you at?
Ain't no way to take you back
I've become heart attack
Everywhere I see your face
And it kills me everyday

So I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you
No I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you

So I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you
No I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you
