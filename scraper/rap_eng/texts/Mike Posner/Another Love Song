[Verse 1:]
I can't stop checking my phone
Cause maybe you called, maybe you called
I play cool but, everyone knows
I'm falling falling, falling falling

[Bridge:]
My friends are gonna cloud me
They gonna tell everyone that I'm whipped whipped whipped, whipped whipped whipped
But I don't even care cause
You make feel like I'm the shit shit shit, shit shit shit

[Chorus:]
So here's another love song, woahhh
Here's another love song, woahhh
Here's another love song, but this one, this one's about you
So here's another love song, woahhh
Here's another love song, woahhh
Here's another love song, but this one, this one's about you

[Verse 2:]
I know I'm moving to fast
But I can't help myself for tryin to tell myself to slow down, slow down
And I feel like I'm 10 years old
But there's nothing I can do to stop thinking about you, I'm falling in love and I'm proud

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
My baby
I wrote this for you. Yeahhhhh
So maybe
You'd be driving in the car, turn on the radio, then hearing my voice come through like blahhhhh

[Chorus]
