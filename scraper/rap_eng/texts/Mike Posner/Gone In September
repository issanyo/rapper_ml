[Verse One]
I used to be a sweet heart
I used to be all right
I tell myself I love you
But I'm creeping every night
When I met you at the party
And I told you you were pretty
I was honestly just trying to score
But you made me wait a week
Just to kiss you on the cheek
Now it's breaking my heart to break yours

[Hook]
I said I love you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall?
I thought I wasn't like the others
Guess I'm an asshole after all
Come September I'll be gone, gone, gone
Come September I'll be gone, gone, gone

[Verse Two]
I used to be a good guy
I used to be all right
I tell myself I love you
But I'm creeping every night
When I met you at the party
And I told you you were pretty
I was honestly just trying to score

[Hook]
I said I love you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall?
I thought I wasn't like the others
Guess I'm an asshole after all
Come September I'll be gone, gone, gone
(Come September I'll be) gone, gone, gone
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, gone, gone, gone
(Come September I'll be) gone, gone, gone
I'd be lying if I said it didin't feel right
I've been trying
But I just can't get the feeling back
When did I become one (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Of the bad guys

[Hook]
I said I love you in the summer
I love you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall?
I lo-lo-love you in the fall
I thought I wasn't like the others
I wasn't like the others
Guess I'm an asshole after all
Come September I'll be gone, gone, gone
Come September I'll be gone, gone, gone
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, gone, gone, gone
You gon' miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
