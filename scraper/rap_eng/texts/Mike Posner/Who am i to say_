who am i to say?

I'm not a huge fan of people
Perhaps I lost my way
Strangers call me lifted, my mother says I'm gifted
Who am I to say?

I called my old phone number
Mom says the sky's still grey
And she wants to know when I'm coming home
Who am I to say?

People love to ask me questions
Like, what am I up to these days?
Will I make more songs, whats taking to long?
Who am I to say?
