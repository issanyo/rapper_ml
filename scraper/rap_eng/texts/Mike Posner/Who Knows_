[This is another exclusive by my man Mike P
Featurin' Big Sean you know what it is
Man this one is called who knows
Benzi, let's get it to it, here we go!]

Sometimes my mind wanders away from me
I know
I light my dutchie up, puff
Maybe one day I'll fly
Who knows, who knows, who knows
(I know)
Who knows
(I know)

I wish that I could be what I want to
I wish that I would do what I don't do
I need a miracle, I hope I come through
I'm tryna work it out, I needa jump soon
Cuz I've about had me enough of not havin' enough slacking and stuff, momma on the phone
Not bragging and nothin' cuz her son ain't really got shit happenin' much
Saw my bank account like where was all the O's at?
Hit the club like where was all the hoes at?
In a lil change you gon' see how shit change you gon'
Be up in the crib like where was all her clothes at?
An' ask yo' girl she know it's easy to say no to a nigga that's broke
But somebody with doe, that got a lil mo'? shit ionno

Sometimes my mind wanders away from me, i know
I light my dutchie up, puff
Maybe one day I'll fly
Who knows, who knows, who knows
(I know)
Who knows
(I know)
And I always had drive
Gets (me) where I'm goin' if I ain't got a ride
And when they ask, do you do what you love?
Ima say I do if I ain't got a bride
And I always carry faith like big
Tryna do it big so my crib on cribs
And my girl ain't gotta worry 'bout shit
Cuz our world is gon' be the shit
So she can tell her momma Ima keeper
I am a dreamer, I coulda been a king, huh
Ima put my hands together like in applaud
Look upward, like whaddup lord
Huh, I know if you try to you could turn these gray skies back to sky blue
It was made for the gift of gold like a drive thru
Give us opportunity and see what we do with it

Sometimes my mind wanders away from me, I know
I light my dutchie up, puff
Maybe one day I'll fly
Who knows, who knows, who knows
(I know)
Who knows
(I know)
