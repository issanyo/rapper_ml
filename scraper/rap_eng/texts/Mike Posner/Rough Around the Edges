[Verse 1]
They say I've gone crazy
And I lost my mind
They say I've been smokin'
They say I look high
Maybe I'm just happy
Just happy I'm alive
I'm tryin' to do my life now
One moment at a time

[Chorus]
I know I'm rough, rough around the edges
But inside of my heart is just like butter when it's melted
And I know it's a curse and it's a blessing
I'm sorry if I screw up, I'm just rough around the edges

[Verse 2]
I guess I grew my beard out
A little too long
They're tellin' me that GQ
Is never gon' call
But I don't give a damn 'bout
The clothes that I wear
And if they don't buy my records
I don't even care, because...

[Chorus]
I know I'm rough, rough around the edges
But inside of my heart is just like butter when it's melted
And I know it's a curse and it's a blessing
I'm sorry if I screw up, I'm just rough around the edges

[Refrain]
Got your hands on my shoulder, every day
I feel the vibe now, I'll be okay
My show is filled up, filled to the top
With melodies movin', it's all that I got

[Bridge]
My sister's alright
And my mama's alright
And my dad's alright
So baby I'm alright
And Finally Famous alright
And Eyes Low's alright
Ocean Jake alright
So baby I'm alright

[Chorus]
I know I'm rough, rough around the edges
But inside of my heart is just like butter when it's melted
And I know it's a curse and it's a blessing
I'm sorry if I screw up, I'm just rough around the edges

[Refrain]
Got your hands on my shoulder, every day
I feel the vibe now, I'll be okay
My show is filled up, filled to the top
With melodies movin', it's all that I got

[Outro]
My sister's alright
And Eyes Low's alright
Ocean Jake alright
So baby I'm alright
