[Intro]
Yeah, listen

[Verse 1]
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go
I can take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby take a chance or you’ll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow
Yeah, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I dunno about me but I know 'bout you
So say hello to falsetto in three two, swag

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

[Chorus]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I'd keep you on my arm girl, you’d never be alone
And I could be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go, I’d never let you go

[Verse 2]
Well, well me what you like, yeah tell me what you don’t
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don’t ever wanna fight yeah, you already know
I'ma make you shine bright like you’re laying in the snow
Burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend 'til the, 'til the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin and a twirl and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook like a whirl wind, swaggie

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

[Chorus]
And If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you’d never be alone
And I could be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go, yeah

[Bridge]
So give me a chance cause you’re all I need girl
Spend a week with your boy, I’ll be calling you my girlfriend
If I was your, if I was your man, I’d never leave you girl

[Chorus]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I'd keep you on my arm girl, you’d never be alone
And I could be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go, yeah
