[Verse 1]
She puts on her best dress her closet can provide her
It ain't much but she makes it work
And he puts on the best cologne
His paycheck can provide him
It ain't much but it'll take the work
And they talked about nothing for a while
Lip stick on a Corona
He decides he loves her right there
But she can't understand, no

[Hook]
And it was almost beautiful
And it was almost beautiful

[Verse 2]
She takes off her best dress
He helps her with the back zip
But he seems a little bit too good at it
She rethinks the whole thing, puts back on her jacket
Left em, she was never to good at it
He wonders if he said something wrong
He was never a smooth talker
And he decided he hates her right there
So he rolls up a joint

[Hook]
And it was almost beautiful
And it was almost beautiful

[Bridge]
We're all searching for some place to disappear (to disappear)
We're all searching for some place to disappear (to disappear)

[Hook]
And it was almost beautiful
And it was almost beautiful
And it was almost beautiful
And it was almost beautiful

[Outro]
Fucking bird chirping this whole song
Shut up!
