[Chorus]
Open your eyes
Make room for a little sweet love
The Lord is all around you, child
And that's what you’re made of
Remember: there is a light
And it shines bright just for you
And you can't cut yourself off from it
No matter what you do

[Verse]
I had a 3.5 at Duke And I was blowin' up
Three albums, I got a row of ducks
When my dad was 22, dawg, he drove a truck
January in Detroit is cold as fuck
You know it’s tough, but I came this far, I ain't slowin up
Livin' life with the LeBron James shoulder-shrug
One thing you'll never hear me say is, "Close enough,"
I'm dope as fuck
I lost 2018 to a broken heart
I wrote this whole thing, I know my part
I made a wild fire from a glowing spark
I press go in March, I gotta go and march
All previous conceptions are blown apart
Not everyone can come with me, it's Noah's Ark
I Ain't Gregg Popovich, I have no remark
These are the type riches one can only hold in heart (Woo)
And anyone that’s gone over my history
Knows I ain’t stuck in the mold of the industry
I am walking down a road of epiphanies
Three words: growth over consistency
Back again, they've been tapping out, McGregor
I’ve been tapping in
Livin' out the dreams I was once just imaginin', it's happenin’
I get so much work done nowadays, it's almost like I have a twin
I can't just sit on the couch shoveling shit in my mouth
I don't know how I'm gonna walk across this country
But I know I'm a figure it out
And who knows what I'm gon' do when it's done
Hopefully, I touch a life; you can be one
I'm not walking to show people who l am
I'm walking to find out who I'll become
The people ain't stupid, they know what's real
Sometime to get to Heaven, we gotta go through hell
And I'm rollin' deep, no Adele
You can ask World Wide Wes, dawg, he knows me well
My life's like an instruction manual
How to not be borin' (Not be borin')
It's my spirit, my smile
That have got me soarin' (Got me soarin')
It broke my heart to tell the band
We will not be tourin' (Not be tourin')
But I just gotta do this (I gotta do it)
I can't stop explorin' (No no)
I was a short lil' Jewish kid, I ain't speak much
My whole life now is somethin' that I've dreamed up
With no handout, I look at my heroes and that's what I am now
Yoga class headband now
People say I'm off-brand, how? I am the brand
Therefore, anything I do is on-brand now, I'm on-brand now
People got attached to a version of me
And it hurts when they see a person who's free
But I'm so grateful for all of these lessons
Twice as much money, half the possessions
No drugs, now the vision's clear
People mad 'cause the old me isn't here
All my gold jewelry just disappeared
That's the universe tellin' me to start switchin' gears
The deeper the human, the deeper the songs
Look at my life, the dream isn't gone
I saw all of this two years ago
It's almost like it was me readin' my poem
People copy, but they copy wrong
Puttin' out a bunch of sloppy songs
If I die and the Rockies don't
Forget to bury me with the Petoskey stone
And opportunities keep on poppin' up
Killer concepts come to me in shavasana
This is just an intro, a daydream
The rest comes January 18th

[Chorus]
Open your eyes
Make room for a little sweet love
The Lord is all around you, child
And that's what you're made of
Remember: there is a light
And it shines bright just for you
You can't cut yourself off from it
No matter what you do, no

[Outro]
Open your eyes
