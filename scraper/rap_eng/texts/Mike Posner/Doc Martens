[Verse 1]
Doc Martens and cotton tees
[?] with his daddy's jeans
Skinny body [?]
I think I'll make him fall in love with me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Get him back to my house
Kiss him up in my bedroom
Spilling all of our secrets
Curled up on my pillows
Making bacon in the AM so
We don't break up 'til the morning

[Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
I think I'd really like to fall in love with you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
And I would gladly give up all my other dudes
To be close-knit, and commit
I think that we should cross that bridge
(Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
I think I'd really like to fall in love with you

[Verse 2]
Bet they made him at the Pentagon
'cause he's a level 10 phenomenon
I'm a hearty face emoticon
Because we're always talking on and on and on...

[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Get him back to my house
Kiss him up in my bedroom
Spilling all of our secrets
Curled up on my pillows
Making bacon in the AM so
We don't break up 'til the morning

[Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
I think I'd really like to fall in love with you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
And I would gladly give up all my other dudes
To be close-knit, and commit
I think that we should cross that bridge
(Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
I think I'd really like to fall in love with you

[Bridge]
Don't say it, don't
I want you company
You're all I really neeâ€” (yeah yeah)
When you lie awake
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

[Alternative Pre-Chorus}
Like you want to get me back to your house
Kiss me up in your bedroom
Spilling all of our secrets
Curled up on your pillows
Making bacon in the AM
So we don't break up 'til the morning

{Chorus}
(Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
I think I'd really like to fall in love with you
(I'd really like to fall in love with you!)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
And I would gladly give up all my other dudes
(All my other dudes!)
To be close-knit, and commit
I think that we should cross that bridge
(Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
I think I'd really like to fall in love with you
