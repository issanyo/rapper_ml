[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I'm from the midwest, we say what up though
We'll do it real big, when I'm back home
Me and Maejor we the next to blow
I made a mixtape, in my dorm room
I can't believe this, it doesn't seem true
I won't stop though til everybody knows that
I'm repping finally famous, and Oslo too,
To Osha and Jacob, I ain't forget you
Bitch I'm bout to blow up, I'm talking real real soon
Make a bunch of money, give it back to the school

[Verse 2: T Mills]
I went from sleeping on the couch when I started
Grinding everyday I couldn't wait until I got my own apartment
Now I'm chillin in a house by the sand
Reach up in my pocket probably touch a couple grand
Growing up I was misunderstood, now this watch around my wrist got me feeling good
Went from Riverside now I'm out in Hollywood
And my buzz world wide like I knew it would
Momma I made it, your boys almost famous
Thanks for the support and I appreciate the patience
Hold up, here's a shout out to my favorites
23 years old and I'm aspiring to greatness

[Verse 3: Chuck Inglish]
Yo, now I was downtown clubbin', ladies night
Seen shorty, she was crazy right
And I approach baby like: "Ma, what's your age and type?"
She looked at me and said, you's a baby, right
I told her I'm 18 and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like
And I know what ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice

[Verse 4: Asher Roth]
Hey ma, what's up, alright, I'm good
Come on we gone get it on tonight
I smoke, you drink, oh word, thats cool
Come on, cause we gone get high tonight

[Verse 5: King Chip]
Dropped so many jams I could do a best of
I get this money, keep the rhythm like quest love
Cleveland nigga under palm trees smoking good
You can't do nothing but respect it if you from the hood
My zip code 44108, click clack when you hear that 44 run away
I lost so many friends in my neighborhood
I know they love to see me down here doing good
