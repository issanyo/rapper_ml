[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
You only love me
In bits and pieces
I keep on workin'
You keep your secrets
That's not an insult
That's not a lie
That's just a statement
Proven by time

'Cause even when I have you
I don't really have you
I am not your last dude
Where'd you get this attitude?
Talkin' 'bout you're leavin'
Cause you don't believe in
Me and all my reasons
Left me with these demons, demons

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
And you're just killing me with silence
And you're just killing me with time
I don't know where to put my sorry's
You're running laps around my mind
How could you leave me on this tightrope?
And I feel nothing when it storms
You know you're killing me with silence
You hold your halo up with horns
You hold you halo up with
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns

[Verse 2: Labrinth]
You know you're clever, I'll give you that
You gave me heaven and took it back
That's not an insult
That's just the case
You've had your pretty mask on
For so damn long
That everybody thinks it's your face
But underneath your eyelids
I can hear the silence
Spreading like a virus
Why'd you wear disguises?
Why'd you have to cut me?
Then act like it's nothing
This time I'm not bluffin'
How'd you know I'm bluffin'
Every single time

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
And you're just killing me with silence
And you're just killing me with time
I don't know where to put my sorry's
You're running laps around my mind
How could you leave me on this tightrope?
And I feel nothing when it storms
You know you're killing me with silence
You hold your halo up with horns
You hold you halo up with
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns
