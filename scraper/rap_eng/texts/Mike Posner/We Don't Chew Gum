We Don't Chew Gum

My girl and I don't chew gum
When we kiss I can taste the bong rips and the red wine she drank before she came over
I can taste the hope and excitement she has mistakenly put on me
I can taste the scars from the men who hurt her
I can taste it all

My girl and I don't chew gum
When we kiss she can taste the protein powder and the black beans cuz I'm tryna get jacked
Silly me
She can taste the groupies I made love to on the road before we met
She can taste the lack of scars cuz I never let anyone close enough
She can taste it all

My girl and I
Chew gum
