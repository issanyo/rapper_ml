[Verse One: Mike Posner]
Standing in the dark with the flashlight
Pretending it's the sun
You've been throwing rocks at the castle
But the king's not at home

[Hook: Mike Posner]
When the walls come tumbling down
Is gonna make it go away
When the walls come tumbling down
Is gonna make it go away
Is gonna make it OK

[Verse Two: Mike Posner]
Standing in the fire with a pea coat
Pretending that is cold
You've been throwing rocks at the castle
Burt the king's too tired

[Hook]

[Michael Franti]
Even when I'm gone away, you are always in my echo (echo)
Even when I'm gone away, you are always in my echo (echo)
Even when I'm gone away, you are always in my echo (echo)
Even when I'm gone away

[Hook]

[Michael Franti]
Even when I'm gone away, you are always in my echo (echo)
Even when I'm gone away, you are always in my echo (echo)
Even when I'm gone away, you are always in my echo (echo)
Even when I'm gone away
