[Verse 1: SRH]
My ice low when my cup filled
And I'm feeling good like I'm supposed to
I'm young baby, all I see is pro [?]
In those city lights but that's old news
I've seen cold nights, hotter days
Feeling like I just hit the lottery
I really wanna get [?]
Tryna lose my mind but we all about a mile away
I got time baby
I better blow your mind baby
I'm a so so hi no pass you fly all over that vibe maybe
Imma get that chance I always wanted
And I got it so I'm thankful
And I'm lifted, I mean faded, I mean tipsy, I mean out cold
I'm a handful, boy I'm off that handle
I swear my pen is on fire no lie yeah I write with roman candles
And you'll, find out when I put a rhymes out what I'm about
No breaks and no time outs
I'm gone baby, lie down, right now
Imma do me, I'm bruce lee with a piece of loose leaf
Excuse me, I'm too raw, I'm sushi
You're plum sauce, you're too sweet
Ou wee
Shoulda done this a long time ago
Imma add this to the monologue
Put your hands up if you wanna roll

[Chorus]
I gotta lot to do, I gotta lot to see
See, baby it's a cold world, everywhere we be
See, everybody talking like they got that got that
Everybody talking like they got that got that
I gotta lot to do, I gotta lot to see
See, baby it's a cold world, everywhere we be
See everybody going like they got that got that
But we nearly got that, but they say they got that

[Verse 2: SRH]
My shoes on and my shrinks laced
And my highs up, it's like I'm in space
Called a hotline for this cold world
And they told me to go get shitfaced
My mistake
I've been great, since 6th grade
At this age had kids pushing at my rib cage
Had a kid going through a little sick phase
But I'm stronger now
Nobody ever wanna have a [?] now
Even when I'm chilling in my gardens now
I ain't gotta settle for that garbage now, quarter mile
All about getting what I need when I need it
Already dug 3 feet, need another 3 feet and I'm sleeping
I'mma get that motivation
Man why I'm so invasive
Many why I'm so impatient
I think I'm going crazy
I mean I knew what I got into
I was on a morgue when I wasn't in school
More money on tour than in a part-time
Yeah I think it's about time I made a big move
If you, think that I got it twisted
Man I live this til I make 6 digits
And I'm drifting in industry with a drug addiction
I'm chilling, this is everything in my soul
I gotta give it so take it I'm in this [?]
But I'm on a roll baby I'll be damned if I make it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mike Posner]
My Jordan 3s [?]
My donnie darko pendant
When I get back on, they treat me like I won a [?]
Yeah I smile a lot, but ain't' shit funny
I'm dressed like a rapper, getting boy band money
My shit, you steal that
Your shit, is still wack
S.S. I peel back
[?] you feel that
F.F. I'm still that
So your girl where [?] at?
And this year, and the next one, I swear I'm gon kill that

[Chorus]
