Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh, yeah, alright

[Hook]:
Hey Cupid (Hey Cupid)
Do I look stupid? (Do I look stupid?)
I'm not going to fall for none of your tricks no more
Your arrow won't pierce my skin no more
[x2]

[Verse One]:
Do you remember Mary?
The one you made me wanna marry
I tried to get into her sex life
But she said I was the friend type
Do you remember Katie?
Cause you made her drive me crazy
I gave her all of my affection
Then she left me for my best friend

Now you keep shooting your arrow
You keep givin' my love away
But I don't see why you don't let me be
I don't want to play your game

[Hook]

[Verse Two]:
Do you remember Rachel?
You made her look like such an angel
She told me I would be her first ride
That was just her first lie
Do you remember Ashley?
The one that only dated athletes
I tried to kiss her in my back seat
She turned away and slapped me

Now you keep shooting your arrow
You keep givin' my love away
But I don't see why you don't let me be
I don't want to play your game

I wonder if you even remember how you gave away my love
Super glued my heart back together now, back the way it was
I wonder if you even remember how you gave away my love
Super glued my heart back together now...

[Hook]
