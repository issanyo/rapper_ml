[Verse 1]
If I could be just one thing
I would be what you're craving
6 foot 3 with steel blue eyes
Sweep you off of your feet, before you count to 5
But the truth is I am just a man
Standing 5 foot 10 doing the best I can
And I've lived long enough to see
You will never be craving me

[Chorus]
Oh, I watched her go
After she planted her love in the top soil
And from the top soil, an iris bloomed
It was pretty in May, but it died in June

[Verse 2]
If I could sing the way I feel inside
It'd sound happy and sad at the same damn time
'Cause when you smiled at me on that dance floor
It was the prettiest mask that you ever wore

[Chorus]
Oh, I watched her go
After she planted her love in the top soil
And from the top soil, an iris bloomed
It was pretty in May, but it died in June

[Outro]
From the top soil, an iris bloomed
It was pretty in May, but it died in June
