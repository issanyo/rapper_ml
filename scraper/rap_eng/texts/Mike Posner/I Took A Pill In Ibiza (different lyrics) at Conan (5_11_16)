[Intro: Conan]
Please welcome, Mike Posner!

[Verse 1 - with changes]
I took a pill in the dressing room
Cause I was nervous to play for you
And when I'll finally get sober, I'll feel 10 years older
Oh, screw it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller, made a million dollars
Spend it on girls and shoes

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on this stage singing
Stuck up on this stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 2 - almost like official version]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
My name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Because as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
The truth is I can't open up

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on this stage singing
Stuck up on this stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 3]
And my dad has cancer
I'm still wrapping my head 'round that
Sat by the hospital bed, nurses poked in their heads
And asked me to sign autographs
And my dad has cancer!
I shouldn't be here, I should be home
But in case you couldn't tell, I'm busy playing myself
In this little Mike Posner show

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on this stage singing
Stuck up on this stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs
