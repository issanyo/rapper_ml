[Verse 1]
I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I need you
Like the sky needs blue
One of three me too for sure
And when I feel like I lost my way
Baby, just one taste of cure

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Baby, show me good loving, make me alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Verse 2]
My broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging
Come give me some
When I'm without you, there ain't no sun
There's only one thing, one thing I'm thinking of

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I need you
Like the sky needs blue
[?] free me too for sure
When I feel like I lost my way
Baby, just one taste of cure

[Chorus]
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Baby, show me good loving, make me alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?


[Bridge]
I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
You say you got a man, I gotta find the way
You 'bout to make me go back to my Carolina days
[?]
First take trophy in [?] too
I still got that [?] too
[?] too
Making all that serious
When you go, I'm furious
You ain't on that shy shit
No makeup on, that's my sugar

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Show me good loving, make me alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
