[Pre-Chorus]
I got a drink in my hand, and my homies do too
The vibe is in the air, I feel it
And all I know is these girls look good
They're nice, young, I can't believe it

[Chorus]
I love my life
I love my life
I love my life
I love my life

[Verse 1]
As long as she's wearing a sun dress
And she smiles when I tell her hello
As long as my whip still goes fast
And there's a little bit of hen in my coke
And hell yeah, I guess I can't really complain
And hell yeah, as long as I can say

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a drink in my hand, and my homies do too
The vibe is in the air, I feel it
And all I know is these girls look good
They're nice, young, I can't believe it

[Chorus]
I love my life
I love my life
I love my life

[Verse 2]
It's doesn't take too much to please me
It doesn't take too much at all
As long as my beat's still down low
And my homies pick up when I call
And hell yeah, I guess I can't really complain
And hell yeah, as long as I can say

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a drink in my hand, and my homies do too
The vibe is in the air, I feel it
And all I know is these girls look good
They're nice, young, I can't believe it

[Chorus]
I love my life
I love my life


[Bridge]
No need for an early night
Even though I've got another early flight
Cause we've got the nine to five, and the vibe tonight
Is feeling right on spot
We might be fading, I'm faded
Still got problems, ain't complaining
We're alive, and it's great
Yeah, I'm just saying that I love my life

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a drink in my hand, and my homies do too
The vibe is in the air, I feel it
And all I know is these girls look good
They're nice, young, I can't believe it

[Chorus]
I love my life
I love my life
I love my life
