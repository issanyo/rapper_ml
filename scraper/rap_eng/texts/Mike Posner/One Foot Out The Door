One foot out the door
Oh Lord

[Verse]:
I've got one foot out the door
Everybody seems so sure
I'm gonna lose my way
As if they were the ones to put the keys in the lock
But I can't smile no more
I can't feel my face
I'm a keep walking forward
'Till the day I turn around
And walk back the same way as I did when I came before
Oh Lord
Cause you know I've got one foot out the door

One foot out the door
