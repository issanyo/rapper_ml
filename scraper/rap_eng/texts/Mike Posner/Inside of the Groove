[Intro]
Yuh-uh yea
Ugh

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Ain't I so smooth
I know that you like the way I move
When the clock strikes two
I'm gon' have you inside of the groove
Inside of the groove

[Verse 1: Rittz]
Tatted up with my jewelry on, my shoes looking so brand new
Stunting like Mont-Blanc Legend on my clothes
Being broke is a no-can-do
And I still can't lose
My team stay winnin' we can have any girl we can choose
We in the ATL but
We be partying like we in Cancun
Double shots of the Avion with no lime to chase
Bout to wipe the slate clean and ride the wave
I gotta diamond bracelet, designer shades
Suede retro nines, look behind the drapes
When neighbors sleep we was geeked up wide awake
We making money when the clock strikes two
And the kids say Rittz I wish I was like you, ooh
Ain't I so smooth, Yeah

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Ain't I so smooth
I know that you like the way I move
When the clock strikes two
I'm gon' have you inside of the groove

[Verse 2: E-40]
Pullin' up in my slab
I'm the man with the mac
I don't rap, I trap
But I look like I rap
Meetin' good dudes cool
Meetin' fake dudes ain't
I play by the rules
A fuck boy I ain't
I ain't with that old sucker shit
Gettin' money is all that I'm familiar with
Diamond clusters all on my fist
Rolex watch cost 46, thow-ow
Used to be broke, now I'm a cash cow
I'm a plug, got the jug in my pack now
Hella love in my hood, smokin' black and mild
Bitch motherfucker I'm smooth

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Ain't I so smooth
I know that you like the way I move
When the clock strikes two
I'm gon' have you inside of the groove

[Verse 3: Rittz]
I made a bunch and man I'm bout to celebrate
I prolly should be rockin' somethin' tailor made
They wishin' I would stop but I accelerate
I got a bottle and some molly in the cellophane
Some purple liquid in my cup, no Welch's grape
I got a couple more notches in my belt to make
I gave that bitch my number
I ain't sittin' 'round waitin' for my cell to ring
And this a lost cause
Our squad
Messin' up the room leavin' drawers, bras
Layin' on the floor, leaving' bars, straws
Layin' on the table by the vase, ya'll
Lookin' at me like you seen a star
When I pull up my car everybody like whooo!
Rittz up in this bitch and I'm like true
Ain't I so smooth, Yeah

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Ain't I so smooth
I know that you like the way I move
When the clock strikes two
I'm gon' have you inside of the groove

[Outro]
Ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh
