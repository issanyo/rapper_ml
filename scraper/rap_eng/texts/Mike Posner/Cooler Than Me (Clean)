[Hook]
I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you right under my arm
I used up all of my  tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey, or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1]
You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't (neat)
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise...shh
I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are ?

[Hook]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you right under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey, or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 2]
You got your high brow, switchin' your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise...shh
I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

Cause it's your scene, (it's your scene)
You got no doubt
But we all see
You got your head in the clouds
