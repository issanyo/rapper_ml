[Verse One]
Excuse me, your heart is in my heart
Hello, you've taken this too far
Am I just a piece to push in your board game?
Have you been laughing all day long?
You like it when it's hard for me to see straight
You make it go on and on and on and on and on

[Hook]
Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go

[Verse Two]
Beg your pardon, you're standing on my love
Hello, have you not had enough?
Am I just a piece to push in your board game?
Have you been laughing all day long?
You like it when it's hard for me to see straight
You make it go on and on and on and on and on

[Hook]  {x2}

[Verse Three]
Hey, it's my time to shine
And my sword is trembling
You're back inside my mind
And I can't stop remembering
I say I'm chasing dreams but you know I've been
Running away from, running away from you
Some sort of comfort in your pain
I can't help from taking
No matter how I change
There will be no escaping
I say I'm chasing time but you know I've been
Running away from, running away from you

[Hook] {x2}
