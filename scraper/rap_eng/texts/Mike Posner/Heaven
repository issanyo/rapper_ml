To the families of the December 14 tragedy

Today, We shed our tear for you
Tomorrow, we do it all again
They say, that time will make you better
I think, about what could’ve been

Still, I believe that there is a whole lot of good people
I believe that there’s a lie
And I believe in more than things I can see my love
And I know this isn’t right

But maybe this will make sense in heaven
And I’ll understand why you’re gone
Maybe this will make sense in heaven
Cause right now it don’t make sense at all

Today—my prayers are in the sky
Tomorrow—they’ll still be there for you
They say-- that time will make you better
And I hope-- that what they is true

Cause I believe that there is a whole lot of good people
And I believe that there’s a lie
And I believe in more than things I can see my love
And I know this isn’t right

Maybe this will make sense in heaven
And I’ll understand why you’re gone
Maybe this will make sense in heaven
Cause right now it don’t make sense at all
Yeah right now it don’t make sense at all
