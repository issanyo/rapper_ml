[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your ship [shit] bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart and soul in your hand
But you played it to the beat

[Post-Chorus: Adele]
Bringing me out the dark
To the beat
To the beat
Bringing me out the dark

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
Cause mine sure won't be shared

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart and soul in your hand
But you played it to the beat

[Post-Chorus: Adele]
Bringing me out the dark
To the beat
To the beat
Bringing me out the dark
