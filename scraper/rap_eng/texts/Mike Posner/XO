I guess we've passed the puppy love stage (love stage)
You barely call my phone no more
You told me work have been crazy lately
Like I'm not busy like I got nothing on my plate girl
Now wait girl
You know u messing up a good thing
See I don't chase girls I erase girls
When they do me like that , be careful or you just another xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo

You pretend like you don't love me( love, me)
Like you don't feel the same no more

Like it wouldn't even phase her to replace her
Like im not body like I can get another date girl
Now wait girl, you know you messing up a good thing see I don't chase girls I erase girls
When they do me like that , now be careful or you just another xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo

Now three minutes is all I need to break yo heart,( break break) break yo heart 
Now three minutes is all I need to make you (make you make you) make you
Xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo, xo
