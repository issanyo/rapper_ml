[Verse 1]
I don't mean to disrespect you
But I noticed from afar
I spend my job singing song in front of people
I'm still nervous where you are, oh

[Bridge]
At the risk of sounding clich√©
I would like to know your name
Please forgive me
If I'm speaking very strangely
I'm not good at these sorts of things, no

[Hook]
I know that I really don't deserve you
And I know you could probably take your pick
But I hope I'm the one that gets to be there
On the very end of your fingertip, fingertip

[Verse 2]
I don't know know which words impress you
So i'll only say a few
Like I'd really like to get to know you better
But you already knew that, oh

[Bridge]
I don't mean this as an insult
But your curves are something else
I don't want to have to share them with your body
I keep them all to myself, darlin

[Hook]
