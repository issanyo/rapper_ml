[Verse 1]
So, what's a young man to do
Had a million in the bank when I turned 22, Alright
Am I the same me?
Doing impressions of myself so people say it hasn't changed me
If only that were true now
But ain't an artist in the game that can do what I do out
I ain't your little secret no more
But listen real close, and I give you one more

[Bridge]
See all of these American dreams, that I find myself living out
Mixed with all of these man-made women that I find myself digging out
They tell me all day long to get a bodyguard to help myself get around
But I ain't ever been afraid of other people getting inside
I'm more afraid of what I got on the inside, getting out

[Chorus]
And what was left. A perfect mess
And if we forget. A perfect mess
And what was left. A perfect mess
That we forget

[Verse 2]
Been a while since '09'member when I told you it was a matter of time
That you believed me
Did it take this long
I told Sean if I ever got on that I'd
Never ever buy a chain with ice
And I didn't
Before this all changed my life
From dreams in the dorm room
To doing big things
In the boardroom

[Bridge]
See all of these non-American bottles that I find myself sipping on
Mixed with all of the things I'mma have to relearn how to one day live without
Mixed with all of the things inside my head that I can't figure out
But I ain't ever been afraid of people seeing inside
I'm more afraid of what I got on the inside, getting out

[Chorus]
And what was left. A perfect mess
And if we forget. A perfect mess
And what was left. A perfect mess
That we forget
