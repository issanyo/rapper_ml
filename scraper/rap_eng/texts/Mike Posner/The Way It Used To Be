[Verse One]
We were young
We were never growing old
And the glitter was still gold
They way it used to be
It was love
It was easy just to smile
It was easy for a while
The way it used to be

[Hook]
But even stars they fade
And colors turn to gray
And I miss yesterday
And the way it used to be
I can't turn back time
Even if I try
I miss you tonight
And girl I miss the way it used to be

[Verse Two]
Look at you
You've got the life, the pretty house
But you must still think about
The way it used to be
Is it real?
He don't love you like I do
Can we just go back to
The way it used to be?

[Hook]
But even stars they fade
And colors turn to gray
And I miss yesterday
And the way it used to be
I can't turn back time
Even if I try
I miss you tonight
And girl I miss the way it used to be

[Verse Three]
Look at us
Just look what we've become
Just a shell of what was once
The way it used to be

[Hook]
But even stars they fade
And colors turn to gray
And I miss yesterday
And the way it used to be
I can't turn back time
Even if I try
I miss you tonight
And girl I miss the way it used to be
