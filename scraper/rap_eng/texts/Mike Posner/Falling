Well alright
Oh oh lord
Well alright
Oh oh lord
Well alright
Oh lord
Well aright

Drive your high heel into my heart
I don't even care
Cause my pride is worth much more than your
Your stupid little love
Every word that you say keeps on bouncing around in my head
When all my delusions of grander have turned into bad jokes instead
You'll be there pointing and laughing to prove you were wiser than I
Well I'm just pretending perfection
I'm flying uncomfortably high

It feels like I'm falling
It feels like I'm falling
It feels like I'm all in
It feels like I'm falling

Drive your high heel into my heart
Cause I don't even care
My pride is worth much more than your
Your stupid, your stupid little love
Every word that you say keeps on bouncing around in my head
When all my delusions of grander have turned into bad jokes instead
You'll be there pointing and laughing to prove you were wiser than I
Well I'm just pretending perfection
I'm flying uncomfortably high

It feels like I'm falling [2x]
It feels like I'm falling [2x]
It feels like I'm all in [2x]
It feels like I'm falling [2x]

It feels like I'm falling [2x]
It feels like I'm falling [2x]
It feels like I'm all in [2x]
It feels like I'm falling [2x]

Well alright
Oh lord
Well alright
Oh lord
Oh lord
