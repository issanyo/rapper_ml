[Verse 1]
Oh
I wonder what she's thinking when her eyes are closed
I'm hoping it's bout me but I will never know

[Bridge]
There's a CD and a T-shirt on the table by your bag
Plus a couple dollars, when you wake up call a cab
I really want to wake her so that I could say goodbye
But what would be the point 'cause

[Chorus]
You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
Baby you don't have to leave

[Verse 2]
I wish that we could go back to the night before
Cause maybe she's the one, but I will never know

[Bridge]
There's a CD and a T-shirt on the table by your bag
Plus a couple dollars, when you wake up call a cab
I really want to wake her so that I could say goodbye
But what would be the point 'cause

[Chorus]
You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
Baby you don't have to leave

You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
You don't have to leave
Rest your head, baby girl
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
When you open up your eyes
I'll be in the sky, somewhere far away
Trying to find my way
Baby you don't have to leave
