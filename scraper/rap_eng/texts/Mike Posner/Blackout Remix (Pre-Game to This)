[Intro: Mike Posner] [x3]
Uh

[Hook:The Knocks']
Passed out waiting for your rescue
Last night had me in the best mood
You say we had a conversation
All I remember is

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
My friends took my cell phone
And drunk dialed Miley Cyrus
I don't know what they said to her
She's rich, she'll get over it
Hello strange lady
I'm not sure if we banged
You look fine in the sunlight
Please don't ask me your name
All I remember is

[Hook: The Knocks'] [x2]

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
You said you were an actress
But I didn't believe you
I guess you need a practice
Cause I didn't believe you
Hello strange lady
I don't know if we banged
You look fine in the sunlight
Just please don't ask me your name
All I remember is

[Hook (x2)]

[Bridge: Mike Posner] [x3]
Red, red cups

All I remember is

[Hook: Mike Posner & The Knock's]
Passed out waiting for your rescue
Last night had me in the best mood
You say we had a conversation
But all I remember is
