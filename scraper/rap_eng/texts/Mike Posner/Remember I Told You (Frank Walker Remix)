[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
I don't suppose you have a moment to spare me
Do you? Do you?
I've been looking for love in all the wrong places
You too? You too?

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I don't like the way you went and told me, "Oh well"
I have the suspicion you're not being yourself
I don't suppose you have a moment to spare me
Do you? Do you?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Remember I told you, I need you
Remember the spark that was there
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (saying I care)

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
You're probably somewhere, with someone I don't know
That's cool, that's cool
And I hope that she gives you, all the things that you deserve
That's true, that's true

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Anne-Marie]
Listen, I don't like the way you went and told me, "Oh well"
I have the suspicion you're not being yourself
You're probably somewhere, with someone I don't know
That's cool, that's cool

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Anne-Marie]
Remember I told you, I need you
Remember the spark that was there
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say) (saying I care)

[Verse 3: Mike Posner]
Had to cut it off and we know why
I'm in love with myself, cold inside
Too many shoes in your closet, go some miles
I suck at talking to girls, here goes a try
More woman than I should've in a century
Bitches on the side like a Kennedy
Starting to drain all my energy
I love it, shoot the frame like an enemy
Uh, At the same time, and I can't lie
Too many girls for the way that I rock the bassline
You got addicted to the seas of the bassline
Let's see how you're gonna do with the back and forth fameline
After all the shit we been through
I played the Roxie, I ain't 'bout to guestlist you
And I know I'm talking shit, it ain't fair
Hate is just a fancy way saying that I care

[Post-Chorus]
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say)
Oh well (say) (saying I care)

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Anne-Marie & Mike Posner]
Remember I told you, I need you (oh well, say)
Remember the spark that was there (oh well, say)
All of the words that I'm saying (oh well, say)
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care" (saying I care)
