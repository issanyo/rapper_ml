[Verse 1]
Say say say, hey hey now baby
Oh mama, don't play now baby
Say say say, hey hey now baby
Said let's get one thing straight now baby

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me if you love me or not
Love me or not, love me or not?
I'll bet the house on you, am I lucky or not
Lucky or not, lucky or not?
You gotta tell me if you love me or not
Love me or not, love me or not?
Been wishin' for you, am I lucky or not
Lucky or not, lucky or not?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooooh, oooh, been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh, tryna' do what lovers do
Ooooh, oooh, been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh, tryna' do what lovers do

[Verse 2]
Say say say, hey hey now baby
You gonna make me hit you with that lay down, baby
Say say say, hey hey now baby
You know what I need, out the gate now baby

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me if you love me or not
Love me or not, love me or not?
I'll bet the house on you, am I lucky or not
Lucky or not, lucky or not?
You gotta tell me if you love me or not
Love me or not, love me or not?
Been wishin' for you, am I lucky or not
Lucky or not, lucky or not?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooooh, oooh, been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh, tryna' do what lovers do
Ooooh, oooh, been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh, tryna' do what lovers do

[Interlude]
What lovers do
What lovers do

[Bridge]
Aren't we too grown for games?
Aren't we too grown to play around?
Young enough to chase
But old enough to know better
Are we too grown for changin'?
Are we too grown to mess around?
Ooh and I can't wait forever baby
Both of us should know better

[Post-Chorus]
Ooooh, oooh, been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh, tryna' do what lovers do
Ooooh, oooh, been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh, tryna' do what lovers do
Ooooh, oooh, been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh, tryna' do what lovers do
Ooooh, oooh, been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh, tryna' do what lovers do
Ooooh, oooh, been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh, tryna' do what lovers do
