[Verse 1]
When we first met I was just a Sophomore
We spent the night on Lydia’s couch
I didn't know you were gonna break my heart then
I didn't know the pain I’d feel right now

[Pre-Chorus]
And I smiled, yes I smiled
But underneath are memories
That I’m trying, yeah I’m trying to let go
And so you left, yeah you left
On someone else's arm now
And I’m trying, yeah I’m trying to let go

[Chorus]
But it’s not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you’re just someone in my mind
That used to be mine
That used to be mine

[Verse 2]
People used to say I didn't deserve you
I was cool with that, 'cause I felt the same
But then they played my song on the radio
And I don’t think you liked who I became

[Pre-Chorus]
And I smiled, yes I smiled
But underneath are memories
That I’m trying, yeah I’m trying to let go
And so you left, yeah you left
On someone else's arm now
And I’m trying, yeah I’m trying to let go

[Chorus]
But it's not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you’re just someone in my mind
That used to be mine
That used to be mine

[Bridge]
Cause baby your beauty marks
Are like shooting stars
In my goofy heart is one of Cupid's darts
I’m just a nervous guy
And these words of mine
Won't reverse the time
To when you were mine

[Chorus]
Cause it’s not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you’re just someone in my mind
That used to be mine
That used to be mine
That used to be mine
