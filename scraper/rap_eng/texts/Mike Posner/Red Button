[Verse 1]
As I sat across the desk from Hova
The only thing on my mind was you
Now you say we're over
I wasted all that time on you

[Hook]
Cause you let me go in December
And I got signed in July
You must think that I don't remember
Cause now you call me all the time
If you think I'm gon' take you back
Baby girl you got another thing coming
You should leave me alone
Stop calling my phone
Cause I'm just gonna hit that, hit that, hit that

[Hook]
Red button [x2]
I don't wanna hear your voice
You get the red button, red button
You should leave me alone, leave me alone
Red button [x2]
I don't wanna hear your voice
Red button [x2]
Cause I'm just gonna
Hit that [x3]

[Verse 2]
Like when you took the job on Wall Street
Barely saw your face no more
Mrs. too good to call me
Now I get paid more than you

[Hook]

[Hook]

Don't call my phone no more [x8]
Cause I'm just gonna hit that, hit that

[Hook]
