[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
You say I don't treat you right
I say that you're too uptight
Then we have a stupid fight
I don't mean to hurt you, but I do
Break up, then I take you back
Make you have a heart attack
Boom boom, there's a heart attack
I don't mean to hurt you, but I do

[Pre-Chorus]
Be my buttercup, be my star
Beat it like a drum, beat it hard
Even though I'm out in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine
Be my lover boy, be my spark
Be my fire, boy, in the dark
Even though I'm out in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine

[Chorus]
Boy, just be mine, just be mine
Just be mine, just be mine, boy
I want you like...

[Post-Chorus]
Uh uh, ah ah ah
Uh uh, ah ah ah
Uh uh, ah ah ah
Uh uh, ah ah ah
Uh uh, ah ah ah
Uh uh ah ah ah (Yeah)
Uh uh, ah ah ah
Uh uh, ah ah ah

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I'm a crazy chick
Do things that'll make you sick
But I get away with it
I don't mean to hurt you, but I do
You say that I make you wait (Uh-huh)
That's true 'cause I make you wait (Uh-huh)
Just one of the things you hate
I don't mean to hurt you, but I do


[Pre-Chorus]
Be my buttercup, be my star
Beat it like a drum, beat it hard
Even though I'm out in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine
Be my lover boy, be my spark
Be my fire, boy, in the dark
Even though I'm out in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine

[Chorus]
Boy, just be mine, just be mine
Just be mine, just be mine, boy
I want you like...

[Post-Chorus]
Uh uh, ah ah ah
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Uh-uh)
Uh uh, ah ah ah
Uh uh, ah ah ah (I want you like)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Oh, oh oh)
Uh uh ah ah ah (I want you like)
Uh uh, ah ah ah
Uh uh, ah ah ah

[Bridge]
I always mess up (I'm sorry)
Really mean it now (I'm sorry)
Just can't help myself (So naughty)
Uh uh uh, so naughty
I always mess up (I'm sorry)
Really mean it now (I'm sorry)
Just can't help myself (So naughty)
Uh uh uh, so naughty

[Post-Chorus]
Uh uh, ah ah ah (boy)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (boy)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Hey, just be mine)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Oh, oh)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Whoa, oh, oh)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (I want you like)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Woo, hoo, hoo)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Woo, hoo, hoo)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Woo, hoo, hoo)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Woo, hoo, hoo)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (I want you like)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Woo, hoo, hoo)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Woo, hoo, hoo)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Woo, hoo, hoo)
Uh uh, ah ah ah (Woo, hoo, hoo)
Uh uh, ah ah ah
