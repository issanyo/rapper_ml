[Bridge 1: Mike Posner]
I can’t wait to try on the crown
I know my ma is gonna be real proud
I told my crew I’m bout to shut shit down
We do it big when I get back in town

[Hook]
Hey ho, hey ho I'mma be the king soon
Hey ho, hey ho I can’t wait to be king

[Drop]
Shut shit down (x6)
I can’t wait to be king

[Bridge 2: Riff Raff x2]
Don’t worry 'bout them angry faces
They just hatin
I keep enough blue jewels to cool off the nation
