[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
It’s three in the morning
I’m up and I’m horny
I want you, I want it, I need you up on me
Are you hungry?
Let me know cause I can cook if you coming
Tell me exactly how you want me to look when you're coming
I could be dressed like a schoolgirl and reading a book when you come in
It's ready for you could come get pussy you want it
Fresh out the shower in a towel, ready to
I.O.U like a vowel for hours
We both getting money I'm just trying feel the power
Winter, spring, summer til we fall like autumn
Lick me all over like they dipped me in chocolate
Give me LoveRance loving, like Mayweather boxing
Beat it up, that's right like I stole something
Speed it up, now I know that made you hungry
Get it up, I can't wait too much longer
Hurry up, hurry up

[Hook: Mike Posner]

Cause I’m speeding really fast

And I’ll be there in a flash, flash, a flash

Put on the gas I'm getting dash
And I'll be there in a flash, flash, a flash

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
How long 'fore you hit my exit on the freeway
We gonna freak and let Pandora DJ
Say you not used to seeing pussy on the TV
Well that's probably cause it's usually on your face, boy what's up?
Damn you so sexy that passive aggression
I love when you sweating, that means that you working around these curves
And when you swerving it excites me
The way you just doing it, Nike
Almost like there's two of me, Siamese
My main thing fuck me good like a side piece
Tell me that I'm beautiful and get it from the side please
And I'll be calling out your name like you need to be reminded
This pussy yours baby, this pussy yours baby
So add some to your food and have more baby
Cause you got me on lock, like a closed door
Now hurry up cause you know what I'm waiting for

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Outro: Mike Posner]

You got me switch my whole shit though, real quick in a flash
