[Intro]
Uh...Alright
I'm on my way to OshFest

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Same Burn Rubber fitted from the first mixtape (Raise up)
Same best friends with me without close-up Jay
And they treat me the same as they always did
Still I'm not making beats in my dorm room shit (Alright)
I'm just a Hip-Hop kid I never really thought it would get this big (Okay, uh)
Couple dollars in my pocket just watch it
I bet that all the girls saying I'm cute (Whooo)
And no more Pa’ sitting with them and looking
And thinking that this could be my substitute (Uh)

[Hook]
But it’s the same shit, different day
Is it that I came up, I feel the same
I’m just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
Just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
I got a dime bag and a dime
She on my right arm, I feel alright
I’m just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
Just trying to live (Na, na, na, na)

[Verse 2: Blackbear]
Same shit, I’m on my own now
Still rocking, young and reckless
I changed my number from my hometown
But every time that they text it, they call me a saint
They always did, just moved to Hollywood, trying to write me a hit (Alright)
I’m just a punk rock kid
I never really thought I’d be on Posner and shit
I’m still the same, but I got some money on the side
But I bet that all the girls say that I’m fly
My crew is wildin, and I’m just smiling cause momma really paid her tithes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike Posner]
Babes, beats and basketball
That’s really all I ever do
Till I pick-up my suitcase
Another tour starts, I’m in a city near you
That’s babes, beats and basketball
That’s really all I ever do
Till I ṗick up my suitcase
Another tour starts, I’m in a city near you

[Hook]

But it’s the same shit, different day
Is it that I came up, I feel the same
I’m just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
Just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
I got a dime bag and a dime
She on my right arm, I feel alright
I’m just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
Just trying to live (Na, na, na, na)

[Outro]
Alright
