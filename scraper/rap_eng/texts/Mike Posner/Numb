[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
This is so dumb, this is so bad
Gotta be numb to push you like that
Liftin' me up, lettin' me fall
Fuck with my head like it's nothin' at all
You were my sun, you were my earth
I was your best and you were my worst
Breakin' my heart one piece at a time
Where there's a piece of my mind, yeah

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you stole my heart
And all I have is a hole where it used to be
And the hardest part is
Now you've got some substitute for me
But he's not the one
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you leave me numb
Yeah, you leave me numb, numb

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Losin' my mind, losin' control
Swallow my pride, you swallow me whole
Smile on my face to cover my hurt
Spent so much time, but what was that worth?
I'm broken apart, I'm savin' it all
Crossin' in my head, mistaken for love
Nails in my back, they don't mean a thing
They ain't yours, they ain't yours

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you stole my heart
And all I have is a hole where it used to be
And the hardest part is
Now you've got some substitute for me
But he's not the one
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you leave me numb,numb
Yeah, you leave me numb, numb
Yeah, you leave me

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
I got trapped off in a blackbox lit from the matchbox of your rage
You said we are merely players who still act off of this stage
I kept begging you to stay, like baby, please don't leave me
Know you don't like fall, but what's one more season?
And I dream on, you gettin' your plot and your scheme on
And I just be here with my theme song
He love me, he love me, no he don't
Cause you make me feel like the night before Christmas
Love is a crime and I'm stuck in your prison
Far as you want, baby, I'll go the distance
If you numb and I'm numb then what are we feeling?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you stole my heart
And all I have is a hole where it used to be
And the hardest part is
Now you've got some substitute for me
But he's not the one
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you leave me numb, numb
Yeah, you leave me numb, numb
Yeah, you leave me numb
