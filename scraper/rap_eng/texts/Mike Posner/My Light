[Verse One]
All I wanted was a record deal
A couple dollars when I got it
I couldn't understand why I still had all my problems
All alone, couldn't find no help
And the stage ain't a good place to find yourself
So I started lifting weights, hoping if I got bigger
All my confidence would too
Didn't work, go figure
Big ole' chest, hole in my heart
I even bought a chain
With ice to glow in the dark
But it didn't work though
Interrupt my work flow
And them haters talked shit
And I took it personal
But today, I feel like someone answered my prayers
I know it’s coming now so it’s cool

[Hook]
Let’s peel off a layer
To what’s underneath
What makes the real me?
I want you to see

Ma ma ma ma ma pain, my struggle
My story, my life
My heart, my spirit
My time, my fight
My flaws, my errors
My god, my life
My heart, my spirit
My time, my light
My light

Light light light
Light light light
Ma ma ma ma ma light
Light light light
Light light light

[Verse Two]
What is meant to be will be, all the rest we'll see
All the rest we'll see
Had to dream up new dreams cause I’m livin out my dreams
Alright
Let's just say it was a new beginning
I followed my heart and now I’m winning winning winning
Like I’m supposed to
Like I’m made for
Sean told me, we still the same brah
All I know is God made me good at writing songs
If you chase the wrong shit your whole life wrong
But it didn't work though, interrupt your work flow
I was on the wrong path, spinning round in circles
But today I feel like someone answered my prayers
I know it’s comin out so it’s cool
