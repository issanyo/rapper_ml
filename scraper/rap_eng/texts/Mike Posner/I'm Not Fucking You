[Verse 1]
I'm not fucking you
'Less I'm drunk as you
That'd be my excuse
I can tell my crew
'Cause the body's hot
But the face is wrong
So they gon' clown on me
All night long

So I take a shot
Take another shot
Never drinkin' up
'Till her face is hot
Till I can't no more
System overload
Sayin' baby lemme take you home

I'm not fucking you
'Less I'm drunk as you
See I want a ten
But you're just a two
So let's keep it low
Keep it secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
That I'm fucked up now
I'm fucked up now
I said I'm fucked up now
I'm fucked up now
She don't look ugly now
'Cause I'm fucked up now
That might sound fucked up now
Oh well

[Verse 2]
I'm not fucking you
'Less I'm drunk as you
That way I won't know why
I woke up with you
Need to find a girl
That'll do me here
Ain't performing 'night
Got no groupies here
Cause I ain't famous yet
But I will be soon
If you come with me
Then you will be too
How many songs do I need before I finally get [?]?
Who knows? Who knows?

I'm not fucking you
'Less I'm drunk as you
Mr bartender better bring his too
And keep my glass full
To the tippy top
'Till this girl right here
Looks like Megan Fox

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm fucked up now
I'm fucked up now
I said I'm fucked up now
I'm fucked up now
She don't look ugly now
'Cause I'm fucked up now
That might sound fucked up now
Oh well

And keep my autotune on
My autotune on
Keep my autotune on
My autotune on
Don't turn that shit off
'Cause I sound like shit
Don't turn that shit off
Man, what'd I just say
Damn
