Woman I Was Scared To Talk To

Hello,
I don't need to know your name
I love you
I am in love with you
I don't need take you on a first date to a restaurant expensive enough to impress you but cheap enough that I don't feel like I'm showing off, I don't
I don't need to wait three dates before I touch your breasts
I don't need you to move in after four months
I don't need to meet your mother and get in an argument with you because I got forgot our six month anniversary
I don't need to be on my best behaviour when I'm around you to undo all the terrible things men from your past have done
I don't need to break up with you because it's all too much and I'm tired of calling you from the road, I don't
I don't need to pretend I don't care about our breakup, dye my hair blonde and write an album about you
no, I can just tell you right now

Hello
