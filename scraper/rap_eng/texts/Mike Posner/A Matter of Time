[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
You've got your head in the clouds
The stars in your eyes
Everyone can see it but you
And I don't know how
You believe your own lies
No one wants to tell you the truth

[Hook: Mike Posner]
It's just a matter of time
Before this all comes crashing down
The harder you try
The more we can see the real you
The real, real you

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
So you're gonna be a big star
They told you you're the next big thing
Everybody's gonna love you
Everybody's gonna know your name

[Hook: Mike Posner]
So push your problems in your impending fame
And push 'em away, push 'em away
Keep your head up, baby, wait for the day
They'll see that you're larger than life

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
You know that you're special
You probably hear it everyday
You know you don't belong here
With normal people doing normal things

[Hook: Mike Posner]
