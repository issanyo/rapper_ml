[Verse One]
I'm a traveling man
Made a lot of stops, all over the world
But in every part, I own the heart
Of at least one lovely girl
I have a pretty senorita
Waiting for me
When I get back to L.A
And all the girls that I ran through
When I was in Cancun
I still don't know their names

Oh my Georgia peach down in ATL
Calls me everyday
And my Brooklyn girl back in NYC meets me at JFK
Pretty Puerto Rican baby I met at the bar
I remember the time
I left the studio late
But you fixed me a plate
And then you let me spend the night

[Hook]
Ohh I'm a traveling man
Yes I'm a traveling man
Ohh I'm a traveling man

[Verse Two]
I have a Carolina cutie, waiting for me
When I get back from my shows
And she never freaks out whenever she hears 'bout
The groupies on the road

Oh my Georgia peach down in ATL
Calls me everyday
And my Brooklyn girl back in NYC meets me at JFK
Pretty Puerto Rican baby I met at the bar
I remember the time
I left the studio late
But you fixed me a plate
And then you let me spend the night

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I'm a traveling man, made a lot of stops
All over the world
And in every part, I own the heart of at least one lonely girl

[Hook]
