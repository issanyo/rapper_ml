*=God

* is in the beggar
* is in the thief
* is in the penthouse
* is in the streets
* is in the rose petals
* is in the dew
* is in December
* is in June
* is in the CO2 that's filling up the air
* is in your enemy to whom you wish to spare
* is in the 808s
* is in the flute
and if * is really * then * is in you
