[Verse 1]
No I'm not the man I used to be lately
See you met me at an interesting time
And if my past is any sign of your future
Then I should warn you before I let you inside

[Hook]
Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever helps you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with loving you

[Verse 2]
I do my best to act like she doesn't phase me
As if I pull girls just like her all the time
I even waited seven days before I called her
But she can play this game much better than I

See I've got girls in every state, now they hate me
Cause I'm leavin just as fast as I came
And if my past is any sign of my future
I'll probably end up not remembering her name

[Hook]
Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever helps you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with loving you

[Bridge]
She deserves better
Better better
Better than me
Better than me
That she deserves better
Better better
Better than me
Better than me
That she deserves better
Better than me
That she deserves better
Better than me

[Hook]
Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever helps you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with loving you

[Verse 3]
Cause I'm not the man I used to be lately
Yeah you met me at an interesting time
And if my past is any sign of your future
Then I should warn you, warn you before I let you inside

[Hook]
Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever helps you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with loving you
