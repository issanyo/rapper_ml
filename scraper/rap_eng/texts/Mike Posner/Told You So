(Pre-Hook)

I don't give a shit
I don't give a fuck
Money in my jeans
Women in my blood
Swisher in my hand
Liquor in my cup
Ain't it just like I told you so?

(Verse)

Yeah I been the man , been the man that's been a fact
Y'all don't understand, I'm the man out here tryna make these bands
Goal for the year is a hundred racks
Catch me with your girl, that's a aftermath
Got your girl coming back, call that after tax
Sorry if she left, she ain't coming back! Shwoop!
Knew I was gonna blow through the roof
Told the lames this was what I'm gon' do
Seem like errbody got something to say but
I ain't ever even gon' trip about you
It's been bout me this whole time
Y'all in a ditch, I'm in limelight
Been waiting patient my whole life
I made a pact, now it's so right
I said n,n,now it's so right
Yea, now it's so right
Yeah, Tell em Pos

(Hook)

I don't give a shit
I don't give a fuck
Money in my jeans
Women in my blood
Swisher in my hand
Liquor in my cup
Ain't it just like I told you so?
I told
I to wo wold ya
I told
I to wo wold ya
I told
I to wo wold ya
Ain't it just like I told you so?

(Verse 2)

Read my mind, psychic hoah
You ain't seeing nothing like yo eyes was closed
I Speak mula, mega, money, that's trilingual
I ain't tripping off no hoe, I got my shoelace on
I even gon flex
If she hit then I'm going to the next
I ain't got time unless she throw neck
Or unless she cuttin my check

I'm busy gotta get mine
Ground up, call that land mine
Put a beat on a stretcher,  psychological homicide

Man y'all did it to yourselves again , did it to yourselves again
I didn't wanna have to do it
But you made me go and do it again

(Hook)
I don't give a shit
I don't give a fuck
Money in my jeans
Women in my blood
Swisher in my hand
Liquor in my cup
Ain't it just like I told you so?
I told
I to wo wold ya
I told
I to wo wold ya
I told
I to wo wold ya
Ain't it just like I told you so?

(Bridge)

Just murdered the game, no metaphors

Rappers at my feet go and call a hearse
Y'all ain't sleek enough, go an get yourself a perm
Came in strong, first song, shouldn't have gave the boy a turn!
Yee!

Now i'm rapping with fashion, big leagues with the captain
I knew I would do this, y'all don't know what happened

My Steelo so rapid, a flash of a camera
I am cinematic, the industry standard
Grab on to your belts cause it's bout to get tragic
I tried to tell you but you  slipped off the canvas
I'm here to be perfect
Fuck what you're planning..

(Hook)
I don't give a shit
I don't give a fuck
Money in my jeans
Women in my blood
Swisher in my hand
Liquor in my cup
Ain't it just like I told you so?
I told
I to wo wold ya
I told
I to wo wold ya
I told
I to wo wold ya
Ain't it just like I told you so?
