[Hook]
Aye, aye, aye
Around the world and back in 21 days
Ay, ya, ya
And everywhere I go you always ask me why
Can't you just stay a little bit longer?
Can't you just stay one more night, right?
Can't you just stay a little bit longer?
I don't know how you live your life
Me either

[Verse One]
The girls love
They see me stuntin on Ellen, Kathy Lee & Regis
The heads love me
Cause my flow way better than all the MC's is
You should be ashamed
You don't even know that you're loosing (stupid)
The shoes you wore in your video
I wear them shits to hoop in
I do it like
Get in the plane, walk in the plane, get off the plane, and go
Do it the same, every day, I'm gonna play my own
I don't know why, every night, them girls be trying to bang
I'm just tryna to do my thang, like

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I used to be your favorite rapper's favorite singer
Before I had my plaques
Now I'm the only singer that your favorite rapper's scared of
Cause I burn them on the track
I know you've seen my video
Your girl got my shit on replay
And that shit that you wore in yours
That's for my mothafuckin' PJs
Like, get in the plane, ride in the plane, every single night
Step on the stage, I'm gonna raise, every hand inside
I don't know why, every night, them girls be trying to bang
I'm just tryna to do my thang, like

[Hook]

Uh huh, alright, uh, the heads like the uh
But the girls they like when I do that, alright
Close the door
