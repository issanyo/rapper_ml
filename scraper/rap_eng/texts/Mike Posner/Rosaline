[Intro]
Uh, alright

[Verse 1]
My girl ain't a supermodel
But care I don't
Only one that makes me feel good
When I don't
She looks like a Sunday morning
That face don't never get boring
When I'm gone, on the road out touring
I hope she knows

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That them other girls try to get me
But I don't really give a damn
Yeah, my friends all tell me I'm crazy
Maybe I am

[Chorus]
Rosaline, she's with me
All you boys better leave her be
I don't care what they think about it (Oo-oh)
Loves me right, holds me down
That's my queen with the broken crown
And I know when she's 'round, I found it (Oo-o-oh)

[Verse 2]
My girl ain't in Hollywood
She ain't no star
Don't know about fancy things
No fancy car
PR says the day the artist
Looks good on the red carpets
I still be her man regardless
Cause that's my heart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My fans say I could do better
But I don't really give a damn
And my friends all tell me I'm crazy
Maybe I am

[Chorus]
Rosaline, she's with me
All you boys better leave her be
I don't care what they think about it (Oo-oh)
Loves me right, holds me down
That's my queen with the broken crown
And I know when she's 'round, I found it (Oo-o-oh)

[Verse 3]
"Yeah, I never wish" she tells me
"Boy, you ain't hard"
[?] deal in the dark
[?] dress shirt
Let her call me Michael
Hold the crown if her head hurt
Last year, where the hoes at? (Right)
This year, them hoes are so whack
Once you go pose you can't go back
My mama told me when you get it
Go on and hold that

[Chorus]
Rosaline, she's with me (Uh)
All you boys better leave her be (Alright)
I don't care what they think about it (Ey, ey ey)
Loves me right, holds me down
That's my queen with the broken crown
And I know when she's 'round, I found it (Oo-o-oh)

[Outro]
All them other girls just can't compare (Oo-oh)
I don't give a damn if they call me weird (Oo-o-oh)
I just feel good every time she's near (Oo-oh)
Everybody else just disappears (Oo-o-oh)
