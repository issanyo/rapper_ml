[Verse 1]
I wake up early in the morning
You go to sleep late at night
I kinda front like I don't want to
Inside I'm losing my mind

[Pre-Bridge]
Do you wanna be my baby?
Do you wanna be my girl?

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me that you got a boyfriend
Don't tell me I'm not your type
Let's do a little less talking
And a little more little more little more feelin' right

[Hook]
Do you wanna be my baby?
Do you wanna be my girl?
Do you wanna be my baby?
Do you wanna be my girl?

[Bridge]
Let it breathe, let it breathe
Let it breathe, let it breathe

[Verse 3]
I like to play hard to get
I walk around talkin' shit
But you know just what I need
See I don't got time for games
And I can't afford diamond rings
But you know you know you know you should be with me (be be with me)

[Hook]
Do you wanna be my baby?
Do you wanna be my girl?
Do you wanna be my baby?
Do you wanna be my girl?
