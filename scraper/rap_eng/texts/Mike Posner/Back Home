[Verse One: Mike Posner]
Yes I know it's been too long
Probably seems I'm always gone
Still don't know where I belong
Wrote this song
Heaven just a plane away
I know my mom, she can't wait
When I feel I've lost my way
I go home, home, home

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Back home
Back home
Back home
Home
Back home

[Verse Two: Mike Posner]
It doesn't feel too much changed
I still get called my government name
Everything still feels the same
Back home, home, home

[Hook]

[Interlude: Mike Posner talking]
Aye. Ladies and gentlemen we have a very special guest with us today. He goes by the name of King Chip

[Verse Three: King Chip]
Either Hopkins or Burke Lakefront
When I touch down we gon' blaze up
We gon' sleep late when we wake up
We gon' crash tomorrow to get away from
Them bad vibes that you call me 'bout
And all them problems you was talkin' 'bout
Man, I really wish Hawk was 'round
And I ain't seen my dawgs in way too long
I can never get use to being away from home
Let me get a haircut, got to pull to roots
Thornhill Drive, yeah these my roots
I remember hittin' Tower City on that Rapid
Now I got a store in Tower City, how that happen?
Never thought Cleveland would be a place I'd visit
But when you from the Midwest man ain't nothin' given

[Hook]
