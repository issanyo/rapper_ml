If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
It's probably cause, you think you're cooler than me
You got your hot crowd
Shoes on your feet
And you wear them around
Like they ain't shit
But you don't know
The way that you look
When your steps
Make
That
Much
Noise
Sh
I got you
All figured out
You meet everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain
You probably think that this song is about you
Don't you?
Don't you?
If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
It's probably cause, you think you're cooler than me
You got your hot crowd
Switching your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know
The way that you look
When your steps
Make
That
Much
Noise
Sh
See, I got you
All figured out
You meet everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain
You probably think that this song is about you
Don't you?
Don't you?
If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
It's probably cause
You think you're cooler than me
And don't you dare act like you don't know, (Don't know,)
Know what's up, (Know What's up,)
Cause your nose is up
I'm approaching up. (Yup)
Like I can't give you winter in the summer
Or summer in the winter
Miami in December
Trying to look bored in them diors.(Diors)
She probably is
Was acting shallow until
She find out how deep that my pockets is
Mrs. Pre-Madonna
This is your reminder
That I think you're fine
But I'm finer
Cause it sure seems
Cause it sure seems
You got no doubt
That you got no doubt
But we all seem
We all seem
We got your head
In the clouds
If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
It's probably cause you think you're cooler than me
