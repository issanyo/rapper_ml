[Verse 1]
When I was a young man I carried my pack
And lived the free life of the rover
I smoked on sativa, guitar on my back
And played my little songs all over

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But in 2010, my country said: "son
It's time to stop rambling, there's work to be done"
And they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun
And they shipped me away to the war

[Chorus]
And the DJ played Miley Cyrus
A Party in the USA
And the DJ played Miley Cyrus
And we flew to the Afghan that day

[Verse 2]
I remember the day our orders came in
I was scared and my stomach was sinking
And when Martinez got shot, I cried with my gun
And I fired right back without blinking

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And we moved down the range, we pumped ourselves well
We chased them with bullets
And we showered them with shells
And in ten minutes flood we blown them to hell
I thought of my mom in Atlanta

[Chorus]
Cause she always loved Miley Cyrus
A Party In The USA
Though the words seemed to take on new meaning
As I turned nineteen on that day

[Verse 3]
I looked at my brothers who'd once been young boys
And their eyes have gone black from the slaughters
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself for life
As we moved down the range towards the water

[Pre-Chorus 3]
But then one day a shell knocked my ass over head
And when I woked up in my hospital bed
And when I saw what it had done I wished I was dead
I never knew there were worse things than dying

[Chorus]
And the nurses hummed Miley Cyrus
As the doctors explained what was wrong
Yeah, the nurses hummed Miley Cyrus
But I no longer cared for that song

[Verse 4]
They collected the wounded, the crippled, the maimed
And they sent us all home to Atlanta
The armless, the legless, the blind and the insane
I wore fatigues and a blood red bandana

[Pre-Chorus 4]
We landed on the same runway we'd lefted on February
And when I looked down where my legs used to be
I thanked God that no one was waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity

[End-Chorus]
And the DJ played Miley Cyrus, again
A Party In The USA
And no one cheered they just stared at us
And slowly turned their heads away
Yes, they slowly turned their heads away
