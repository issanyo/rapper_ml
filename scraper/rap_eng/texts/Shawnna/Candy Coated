Shawnna, TrackBoyz, Def Jam
You know I keep it Dickie down get it to my toe
And when you see me reachin fa that itchy hit da flo'
It me and all my girls and they got us at the door
That queen kickin in do this nigga really know
We push 'em to da side and we make it through the club
They try to show me love, erebody want a hug
And now they tryin to hit me wit the bottles of the bub
But I be rollin sticky shawty hit me wit da dub
And now I got my hands up feelin real tight
We pourin out the Cognac buckin where the light
The dj shout me out and now they want me on the mic
Before I hit the stage I see some niggas finna fight
And now they on they monkey bone missin in my flow
But yo I know you heard about the niggas from the go
Roll up anotha B I see 'em slick its on the low
Here come security they tryin to kick us out the door. Oh

[Chorus]
Tryin to find out where the party at
Got a couple of them stacks finna mix it wit the Co-ni-ac
Weight a minute, weight a minute
Weight a minute, weight a minute
I'm at the club where the V.I.P
Stupid niggas at the door tryin to say they wanna see I.D
Weight a minute, weight a minute
Weight a minute, weight a minute
I'm big balla but I don't drink champagne
White mink to da flo' color cocaine
Gator boots and the belt wit the low frame
Candy coated Monte Carlo wit the upgrain
Weight a minute now they wanna see a bitch ball
I'm iced out from my tittie to my tip toe
We at the bar finna but the whole thang out
And if somebody wanna start we can bang out
I let my chain swang down to my waistline
I won't dance we just move to the base line
Tell a nigga wait a minute fo i take mine
