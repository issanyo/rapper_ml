[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Money all in my brain
Money all in my mind
Y'all remember my name
These hoes two steps behind
Money all in my brain
Money all in my mind
Now get up out my lane
Bitch I'm on my grind
Tha money, tha money, tha money
Bitch I get tha money, tha money, tha money
Bitch I get tha money, tha money, tha money
Bitch I get tha money, tha money, tha money
Bitch I get tha money

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm gettin' money
Bitch I'm gettin' cash
A bitch ain't nothin' to me
Cause bitch I get that back
Some say I'm conceited
Some say I'm the shit
Some say I should quit it
But I say suck a dick
Coconut ciroc, patron by the shot
I got ten bad bitches, all them wanna fuck
All them wanna suck, some of them wanna swallow
Watch me lead the way, the rest of these hoes gon' follow
I get money all day, same shit tomorrow
Pourin' out all this lean, dumpin' out all these bottles
This ho say she model
This ho say she act
But show that ho some money
She gon' lay on her back
A ho gon' be a ho
A bitch gon' be a bitch
A slut gon' love to fuck
A trick gon' be a trick now I say
A ho gon' be a ho
A bitch gon' be a bitch
A slut gon' love to fuck
And a trick gon' be a trick

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay my closet look like the Gucci store
Jewelry box like a diamond mine
All this ice on my ? you wonder why I can't find the time
To conversate with you silly chicks
Cause I'm allergic to silly shit
Sneezin' off you filthy hoes
Cause you filthy broke and I'm filthy rich
And I told them hoes there's no stoppin' me
GMG a monopoly
We that team gon' see that green
And I see my dreams I'm gon' ?
Oops I mean ?
While them haters keep watchin' me
Cause I'm the shit, gon' be the shit
And if she the shit, then not today
I got money all in my brain
Money all in my mind
All I see is these dollar signs with that money on the cocaine
Shawty told me he rich
He gon' take me on trips
Shopping sprees way overseas
I got all the keys to these whips
All this money I stack, I got racks on racks
She can't do it like this
She can't do it like that
All this money I stack, I got racks on racks
She can't do it like this
She can't do it like that
Cause I keep

[Hook]
