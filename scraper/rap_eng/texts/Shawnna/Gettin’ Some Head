[Chorus]
I was gettin' some head
Gettin' gettin' some head
I was gettin' some head
Gettin' gettin' some head
I was gettin' some head
Gettin' gettin' some head
I was wit the kinda girl that make yo toes pop
I was gettin' some head (DTP hustle)
Gettin' gettin' some head (DTP hustle)
I was gettin' some head (DTP hustle)
Gettin' gettin' some head (DTP hustle)
I was gettin' some head (DTP hustle)
Gettin' gettin' some head (DTP hustle)
I was with the kinda girl that make your toes pop
You know you nigga want a bitch like me
Apple bottoms with the wife beater rockin' nikes
All the niggas in the hood wanna call her wifey
If you got a pretty dollar then I probably might be
You niggas popin' collars your bitches pop ps
I'm gonna' do this for my riders that get down and pop e
Think you can pop me man you need to stop please
Catch me flyin' through your hood in a drop top v
I'm in the pop top three
And my pops got gs
Say the watch got chilly
And the rocks got freeze
And you broads ack silly
Tryna jack my steam
You're slipin' and I'm pimpin' and your boy chose me
And now he hollin' hey li'l mama can you give me a sec
I got a li'l somethin', somethin' about as big a your leg
This nigga yawn while he talkin' so I knew he was wet
And about like six in the mornin' he forgot what he said and I was

[Chorus]
You know I keep like 4 5 woofers in the trunk
And I turn it to the max so you can feel it when it bump
When you go to DTP we give the people what they want
And when I come to hustle man you know we ain't no punk
And you catch me in the town we blowin' dro and gettin' drunk
And when we hit the party man you know we keep it crunk
You nigga actin' tough he on the floor and gettin' stomped
Don't act like you ain't know now tell your hoe to pass the blunt
You bitches wanna be me 'cause you know that I'm the shit
You see me on the TV 'cause I roll with Ludacris
Don't hate Shawnna baby just be mad at who you with (who you with)
I keep a couple handles so you know I'm too legit (too legit)
Just so you understand it so you know I'm 'bout that bread (I'm 'bout that bread)
And don't you try to play me for no joke about my cash (about my cash)
Before I get the tip I get the heat up out the stash (up out the stash)
I hit 'em on the low and shawty this is what he said (what he said)

[Chorus]
