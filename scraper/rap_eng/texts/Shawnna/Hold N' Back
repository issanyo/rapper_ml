[Intro: Shawnna]
Why you treat me like you do?
Can it just be me and you?
Cause I don't wanna play no more
If I let go, you let go
Cause i just can't get enough
And i just wanna feel you touch
I just gotta know whatsup, wutsup, wutsup

[Verse 1: Marques Houston]
Hey girl come here sit down
Lemme holla at you a while
Gotta get this off my chest
Hope that you can handle it
We've been seeing each other a lot
Honestly I dont want it to stop
You and me; Me and you
Im liking what we've got
Only thing thats bothering me
We ain't as close as we should be
Thats cause your holding back
Holding back you love for me
How do you expect to grow if you just won't let go

[Chorus: Marques Houston]
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Why you acting like that, girl dont do me like that
All Im tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
All I want is you

[Verse 2: Mya]
Dont take offense to this
Not tryna start no mess
Ain't tryna have you stressed
This is just a little test
I wanna see how serious
Serious you are of us
Do you like or like me not
Im loving what we've got
Only thing that bothers me
We ain't close as we should be
Thats cause your holding back
Holding back you love for me
How do expect this thing to grow
If you dont let it go go go

[Chorus: Mya and Marques Houston]
Babe
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Why you acting like that, girl dont do me like that
All Im tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
All I want is you

[Verse 3: Shawnna]
Everytime I get to thinking bout you
I see I can't be without you
Cause you that shit, thats it
And I really can't leave rite now boo
You my fix, your kiss
Made me bout to let go bout to
But wait right quick can't slip
I dont really think your down with this
See I played these games before
And i fall everytime we go
Cause see I can't no more
I move slow but dont really wanna stop the flow
Dont know what to do
Gotta just relax and hold back
Just sit back and roll back

[Chorus: Mya and Marques Houston]
Babe
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Wht you acting like that, girl dont do me like that
All Im tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
All I want is you

[Outro: Shawnna]
Why you treat me like you do?
Can it just be me and you?
Cause i just can't get enough
And i just wanna feel you touch
Wutsup wutsup
Why you treat me like you do?
Can it just be me and you?
Cause i just can't get enough
And i just wanna feel you touch
I just gotta know whatsup, wutsup, wutsup
