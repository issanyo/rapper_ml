[Intro: Ludacris]
Hehehe, yeah (let's GO, ohh!)
Damn right nigga (yeah yeah) what? (yeah)
Okay (y-y-y-yeah) these girls be askin me, you know
How, how long, how long I can go for
I tell 'em like this nigga (what you tell 'em?)
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say OHH! {*scratch*} OHH, OHH, OHH!
{*scratch*} Gim-gim-gim-gimme some mo', HEY!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Ha! I do it all night, my whip is all white
I done had a couple drinks and I got a little buzz so I'm feelin alright
But the night's just gettin started, haters get disregarded
Roll up them sweets, creep-creep let's hit these streets and get retarded
I pop a bunch of bottles, my bitch be poppin too
Keep talkin out yo' face, and she might be poppin you
She might be pop lock and droppin down to the flo' wit it
Meanwhile all my dogs chasin paper, that's right we go get it
So get it right (get it right) kill the lights (kill the lights!)
I'm feelin like I might just pop a pill tonight (pill tonight)
Cause the feeling's right (the feeling's right), pass me a Miller Lite
Then grab that girl with the Coke bottle shape, she's my type (woo!)
I'll take her home (take her home) and do the do (do the do!)
I know the Kama Sutra, think what I'll do to you
Stick to you like super glue, maybe even like bubblegum (okay!)
Don't go to sleep woman (why not) no matter how many times I cum

[Hook: Ludacris & (Shawnna)]
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say OHH! {*scratch*} OHH, OHH, OHH!
{*scratch*} Gim-gim-gim-gimme some mo', HEY!

[Verse 2: Shawnna]
Ayy, ayy
I do it all night, and I ride them logs high
Baby lil' crib good, I'mma ask his shawty what that mouth like
Tell me if it's out of sight, tell me if he's slow and long
Then he made his tongue above his nose, I said "You know you wrong"
But I'm really like sho' you right, tell me where you wanna go tonight
Anywhere, any place, I can see it in your face you are the prototype
To the ceiling I'm so so high, so-so feelin like I'm so so right
Please tell me why the 'dro so fire, I can't stop zonin and I don't know why
Ay look - beep beep get up out my lane, y'all hoes can't do it like me
If you're thinkin I'm 'bout the game, take a look at my U-N-I-T
That's right I'm back on deck, but don't get it twisted the strap on deck
The mac on deck, the pack on deck, and e'ry damn day keep a rack on deck
And that's on Jeff, that's on we, that's on Hoover and that's on me
That's that wood that match them seats, and that's in the Caddy and that's on 3's
No matter what they said I been gettin my bread, get my paper, get my check
But anybody wanna try to ask I've been gettin some heeeead

[Hook: Ludacris & (Shawnna)]
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say OHH! {*scratch*} OHH, OHH, OHH!
{*scratch*} Gim-gim-gim-gimme some mo', HEY!
(I do it all night, I do it all night)
(I do it, I do it, do it all night)
(I make 'em say) OHH! {*scratch*} OHH, OHH, OHH!
{*scratch*} Gim-gim-gim-gimme some mo', HEY!

[Verse 3: Ludacris & Shawnna]
How many women can I fit up in my Cadillac?
So high I can't SEE, feelin like I got cataracts
Some in the middle of the night say I get drunk and don't know how to act
I don't know how to act
He don't know how to act
And I don't know how to stop, and I don't know how to quit
Blowin on a couple zone, now we need another fifth
And I mean I'm out my mind, not I mean I'm out my body
See we do this all night, is you comin with me shawty?

[Hook: Ludacris & (Shawnna)]
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say OHH! {*scratch*} OHH, OHH, OHH!
{*scratch*} Gim-gim-gim-gimme some mo', HEY!
(I do it all night, I do it all night)
(I do it, I do it, do it all night)
