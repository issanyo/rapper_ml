[Hook] (2x)
I'm 'bout to break sumthin'
Break sumthin', take sumthin'
Break sumthin', break sumthin', take sumthin'
I'm 'bout to break sumthin'
Break sumthin', take sumthin'
Break sumthin', got ya saying ahhh shit!

[Verse: Ludacris]
Yea, Fe, Fi, Foe, Fum
I smell an ounce of that good and a fifth of rum
Ain't no mistakin' Shady Park is where I'm flippin' from
It's so Shady my old lady gotta' keep a couple guns
You get the runs and I ain't talkin' about the bowel system
I'm talking bleeding, hurry wrap 'em in a towel system
Get the fuck out now system
It's animosity, curiosity, robbery
Probably the reason why theirs no stoppin' me 'till you cop a plea

[Verse: Shawnna]
Man, see now these bitches wanna fuck wit Shawnna
When I bump that thang and keep a pocketbook of marijuana
Better keep that mouth out my business
Cause I got that 50 for ya
And I'm off the whip in this bitch and somebody shoulda' told ya
I'm drinkin' Remy and these bitches lookin' at me shady
They must don't know that I'm that bitch that smoke 'em in the face
Better take me up out the club cause I'm about to break
And all bitches and thugs know how we operate
We 'bout that take nigga

[Hook]

[Verse: Fate Wilson]
Little Shorty from G-Roll
On the hustle to see six figures or more
Whether rappin' or pimpin' hoes
I'm high capping the gold
And I know I made them boys sick when I popped up on 24
It's tit, let's roll

[Verse: Tity Boi]
You see me diggin' in my gold
I'm a ghetto bastard and when I'm smokin' on 'dro
I get the munchies directly after
I made doe by offing hoes in transactions
You see I stay on Riverdale Road
But I'll meet you up on Naston

[Verse: Fate Wilson]
Cause in the south side partner we break you off proper
And the doctors can't help ya when the guns go block-ah
Time to notify the pastor ya family you'll mourn after
Yea the day after your ashes get scattered
You're all out next batter

[Verse: Tity Boi]
I don't need no approval for poodles cause I'm a fool, dog
Get to fighting in clubs and swing with pool balls
Shorty's raw, walking by, I try to grab sumthin'
If you don't say sumthin', I'm gon' take sumthin'

[Hook]

[Verse: I-20]
Shit..
Blow you to bits and pieces
My niggas with Caprices
A Gucci bucket, Polo down with them heavy creases
I'm East Side, Scottsdale, throw it up dog
I got them rocks by your block throw it up y'all
Slingers, 'dro, and pampus
Let's get it poppin' doctor
Mack 10, AK's when we shoot them choppers
My niggas ridin' hard, my niggas hot and hard
I-20 will bust some fo's so get down boy

[Hook]

[Outro] {*repeat to fade*}
Break sumthin', take sumthin'
