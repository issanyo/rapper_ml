[Hook: DJ Victoriouz x2]
I be talkin bandz, I be talkin bandz
If you ain't talkin' money, we mean business man
I be talkin bandz, I be talkin bandz
20,000 dollas in my robbins, man

[Verse 1: Shawnna]
Look, I stay smokin' on that loud shit, loud pack, that loudness
I'm out this bitch stuntin' man
Your chick don't want none of this, fuck with this
You will need your bucket list
Trust me, I'm not the bitch you thought
Wasn't gon' bust it quick
Bang bang on these weak hoes
Throwin' money like free throws
You mad cause he chose and I'm stackin' chips like fritos
Doritos, I'm in heathrow
Gin and juice and my feet cold
Six inch in em heels got that strap on em
And when the beat go
Ye ain't nothin' like me, hoe
Asian girl, I call 'er mi-ho
Big money, she a bad bitch
Keep she sum' and give me mo'
Pussy wetter than nemo
Money longer than the sea flo'
She mad cause she sellin' them sea shells on the sea shore
See, hoe, I'm not like that otha shit
Don't compare me to no otha bitch
My wrist game like butter whips
So please get off my mothership
Cause I'm high, don't know when I might come down
Niggas in my clique move like they the feds
Cause ya neva know when they might come 'round
Nigga

[Verse 2: Shawnna]
Uh, shawnna, look, ok
It's first two on these fuck hoes
No time for these fuck hoes
Shawty got that good dick and he lick pussy and suck toes
We A1 and they rocked up, long money, he stacked up
Two robbers got one Bentley, one Aston martin needs backed up
And I'm pullin' up in that loose shit
Got a new neck, got a new wrist
And y'all niggas gon' have much
Y'all knew this and that's Ludacris
I got an iced out crucifix
Fans out in Budapest
I don't speak that language, but they say it mean, you the best
I'm like who the best? You the best!
Kill the beat and I do the rest
That loud movement all through my chest
And I'm truly blessed; true perfection
I've been rich since childhood
And I still sip that wild wood
Hoe tryin' to get next-imated
I'm like can we please? I'm like y'all good
Rich bitches we all hood, y'all ain't ballin' nigga
Y'all should, layin' out on that white sand with that dark sand it'll be all good
I'm gettin' money the long way, fuck you and what y'all say
Y'all hate but I'm gettin' money
All night, all day

[Hook: DJ Victoriouz x2]
I be talkin bandz, I be talkin bandz
If you ain't talkin' money, ain't make business me
I be talkin bandz, I be talkin bandz
20.000 dollas in my robbins, man
