[Intro: Shawnna]

Yo... Shawnna...It's your boy C-Mob
[???]

[Hook: C-Mob]
You know me im on again, yea im on again (x4)
Yea im on again, on again, yea bitch im on again (x4)

[Verse 1: C-Mob]

Yea I'm on again, got my eyes on the prize, and now im zonin' in
Better get back I'mma get that to the rift raft and that i am prone to win, known to sin
When I'm on the clear liquor, that patron and gin
You wanna make money, we can make it together, but they can put it on a stick so on a [?fin?]
On again, In that back of the club now let's roll the dutch
You don't like me, I don't really give a fuck, you ain't bold enough, so hold the crutch
When the guns come out the rain the soul the touch
You don't wanna face off with my folks, ain't no motherfucker that's cold as us
F-fold 'em up like paper planes, make it thunder, make it rain
Leave her unattended and i might step in and take your game
No tolerance for fakes and lames, I'ma leave em all with aches and pains
Treat this in the street just like a bitch and watch me rape the game
Takin' names and kickin' asses
Still in that Midst Of Madness
You better get back when i pull out the heat and you see that rips and thrashes
I'ma take care of everyone comin' at me on that side was tricky shit
And still walk out of the club untouched in a fresh new Dickie fit

[Hook: C-Mob]

[Verse 2: Shawnna]

Ey, I'm so high, I can't see the bitch right infront of me, askin me if her and her bitch can get drunk wit' me
Rollin' off a peel, and I'm higher than a Meteor
Shorty body ill, but I'm a little meatier
Sippin' on Ciroc, and I'm blowin on petroleum
Shorty tried to front, and we'll lay her like linoleum
I think I'm finna roll me one
Blow it back and pull me one
He said 69, I said 68 i owe you 1
O-M-G I'm on again, Verses I be going in
I'm colder in the winter in them cities it be snowin' in
I'm pullin and I'm rollin up, wrap my CD it'd be throwin' up
And if you wanna try me man, I promise ain't no ho it us
Money long as latitude, bitches show me gratitude
Haters wanna hate, but now they switchin' up they attitude
And I'ma do my damn thang, diamonds in that damn ring
Shawnna there's to many fuckin' diamonds in that damn chain

[Hook: C-Mob]

[Verse 3: T-Rock]

My team has been known to win, hear this, I'm goin in
I'm cashin' cheques, look at me bitch im on again
Look we walked up, we known to sin
All I know is i want this V.I.P, if you ain't fit for war, you won't get in
First I have a wife and um
I just put this pipe in em, then niggas comin' beef, I knock their bitch ass out, like Vicodin
Man that bitch is trifling, searchin' for excitement
You wanna fight wit' me for smashin' and this shit is trifflin'
I'ma keep it dippin', I am no longer deciefferin'
You smash a chick, I'll smash her too, My G is just recyclin'
I'ma keep a missle near, adversaries disappear
When I off that 4 5 counters deadly and darker than Worcester
My diamonds so crystal clear, when I shine it's proper light
I'm so icy my diamonds look just like Ciroc on ice
I look down like see before, runnin like we see more
I'm on again like sit-com reruns of your favorite TV show
(ya heard meh?)
