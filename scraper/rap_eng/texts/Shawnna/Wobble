[Intro:]
This another street heat-BANGER!

[Hook:]
Look how she wobble with it! (4x)
Now won't you shake with it! (4x) [2x]

[Verse 1]
Look how she roll with it, shawty cold with it
Shawty make you wanna get out on the floor with it!
I ain't a dyke, bitch, but if I might, bitch
I got the money that could take you home tonight, bitch!
Now all the hoes get down on the floor
And we gon' throw this money 'til they say it's time to go
I'm sippin' on Ciroc, I'm blowin' in the dro
I'm standin' on the speaker like I'm finna do a show!
Look at it on her, the one right there
She climbed on the pole, she froze in the air
She [?]. dropped into a split
I'm lookin' like "Damn, she the shit!"
Shawty don't quit, she all about the money
She bouncin' through the club like the Energizer Bunny
She pop-pop-poppin' that pussy, call her Popper
'Cause when she get to rollin', [?] can't stop her!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Damn, ho!  Oh, it's you again
Go show them muhfuckas how to do it, then!
Shake your right cheek, shake your left cheek
They made it rain, now she wetter than a jet-ski!
Now watch her d-d-do it, do it, do it like a pro
She walked around the pole, put the pussy on the floor
She laid on her back, her legs in the air
'Cause she ain't got a [?] on her underwear!
Shawty don't care, she all about the paper
She keep takin' shots to the dome, no chaser
She whip-whip-whippin' that pussy, call her Whipper
And if she keep twerkin' while she work it, I'mma tip her!
A stone-cold stripper, a whole lotta ass
She workin' on the pole, got a floor full of cash
Them other hoes mad, but go on, make 'em sick
'Cause you be gettin' money, and they be gettin' dick, trick!

[Hook]
