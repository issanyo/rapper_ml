Come take a walk on my side of the town wit me
And we gon' ride it ain't no thang come on get down wit me
Come take a visit thru the city and go wit me
And we gon' roll up the dro come on and blow wit me
I'm about that city with them go-gettas and slut bitches
How about that chevy with that four heavy wassup nigga
Never 'bout that gutta but the mentality stuck wit her
Fuckin wit that butta and thats ok, nobody fuck wit her
Let me take you back to how it all kicked off
I was rollin wit my niggas then we took a long dip off
I was blowin swishes in the backseat and pullin it off
And i wasn't really thinkin bout it
I was gone of course
Then we pulled on the (get out) he told me get out
Knocked on the door gave me the coke and said dont open ya mouth
I played it cool and didn't move til he gave me the cue
But on the real deep down inside a bitch ain't know what to do
He walked this nigga to the back left me alone in his room
A couple minutes now im thinkin what we on is it cool
Im thinkin i should see whats happenin' lets get on witht his move
But then my nigga ran up on me cooly holdin his tool
Like lets get little hold the pistol and the paper lets go
And when we get back to the hood dont think nobody should know
And if you tell a motherfucka i'ma come for ya throat
But if you stay a down bitch I'll keep you comfortable
Now what the fuck im 'pose to do this nigga family to me
Lockin the game up by the blocks and papi hand me the key
Bandana on my hand and clamped on the hammer to squeeze
Was just a child im livin wild this nigga fouler than me
Livin in hell these niggas burn to a thousand degrees
Im drownin out sick from the germs in the bowls of the bees
Just when i get down to my last this nigga hit me in code
Get to the bus don't bring no bag, lets get this money lets go
Damn
**chorus**
Come take a walk on my side of the town wit me
And we gon' ride it ain't no thang
Come on get down wit me
Come take a visit thru the city and go wit me
And we go roll up the dro come on and blow wit me...
