Okay my pussy wet like the ocean, gasoline I be smokin’
I ain’t playin’ no games ho and I ain’t got time to be jokin’
Shout go out to my weed man, shout go out to my jeweler
Shout go out to that Cartier, shout go out to my shooter
Damn right I got it, damn right I get it
You don’t want no problems but damn right I’m wit it
Clique full of killaz, ya bang bang that chain swang
You play games, your brains hang
Like click clack, bang bang bang
Catch me in the kitchen, you know what I’m whippin’
2 door coup for sale, you know what I’m dipping
Double cup Shawty, you know what I’m sippin’
I say fuck you to them haters cuz you know what I'm getting bitch
