This nigga got me making love with my eyes open
Keepin it goin with the up and down, back and forth
And the side and around and he askin more
And he tying me down to the backboard
And it sound like we tearing down the back wall
And I ain't trying to play your blind shawty
I'm trying get up in ya mind make you mine shawty
And ask my best frend if you think I'm lying shawty
You got your game right and I think you're fine shawty, for real
And he ain't trippin on my record deal
Or how I'm lookin in my pictures with my sex appeal

And got some orange juice ready for them X pills
