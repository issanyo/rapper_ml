[Verse One]
I ain't that bitch that'll be in da club
With niggas acting like it's sweet in da club
I'll bust a mafucka meat in da club
And bitches steppin' on my feet in da club
Trying to see who they can freak in da club
A mafucka wanna speak in da club
Like a mafuckareally knows me in da club
Got my fitted on, chiefin' on leaf in da club
Look around, got to see who want P in da club
See them lame niggas sippin' Don P in da club
When you're smellin' 'Gnac, matter fact, we in da club
White tees and them Air Force, deep in da club
Throwin' up a sign, nigga, what, street in da club
Make your head nod cause my joint beat in da club
For them niggas that'd spend they whole week in da club
And the bitches that'd be drunk and want to beef in da club
And them hatas that'll see their blood leak in da club
You can't breathe in da club, it's called
