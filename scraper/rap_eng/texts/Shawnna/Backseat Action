[Intro: T-Pain]
OHHH! OHHH!
I'm about to pull over, and give you the business
Holla at me (OOOH) can I get a witness?
Now here we go - hmm, hmm, hmm
Here we go - hmm, hmm, hmm

[T-Pain]
Baby~! I've been waitin for you to come home
Cause I done cleared off the backseat
Cleaned the top, and put some new 24's on the Brougham
Lately~! I've been waitin to try something new
Cause we done did every last one of yo' fantasies
But we ain't did nothin I wanna do
Cause we done did in in the elevator (been there, done that)
Now it's time to do it my way (I know you want that)
And pullin your hair, won't even compare
To what I'm 'bout to do to you on this highway

[Hook: T-Pain]
I'm talkin 'bout that backseat action (ohhh)
Out in the middle of the traffic (ohhh)
'Bout to pull over, and give you the business
Holla at me (OOOH) can I get a witness? Now here we go
[Bridge: Shawnna 2x]
Here we go, back and forth (hmm)
Break it down, or take it slow (hmm)
Take control, make it last (hmm)
Break it down, now here we go (here we go)

[T-Pain]
Shawty~! you can call me whenever you need
Workin in the Excursion, kissin in the Expedition like yes indeed!
Baby~! It's all gravy - it's all good
Cause we gon' need to open up the back do' and let your legs out
Or I'mma put you right on the hood
I've been down like an elevator (been there, done that)
I know you like to do it my way (I know you want that)
And pullin your hair, won't even compare
To what I'm 'bout to do to you on this highway

[Verse 3: Shawna]
Face down, ass up - that's the way I like it rough
Cloud it up, back it up - driver's seat to the passenger
Back to the back, all in the act - smack, smack, smack, smack
Shinin like that that good old kid, hands on the window foot on the wheel
Face in the seat, wait for the beat, rockin 'n rockin 'n makin it squeak
Stop, stop, stop, stop - what'chu gon' do? Somebody might see
So make it fast, take it slow
Break it down and make it roll
Take control, make it swoll
Now one mo' time cause here we go

[Hook]
