Verse 1
Papi just let me say oohh, I got a feeling in my back bone
Grinding my body, can I get it with the track on
Ah shit he got the fitted with the black on, black looking killer, by the way thats how I like em
Its a party in the hood and they say its tight, and that head right, bet we there every night
I got my fitted on (check)
Got my dickies (check)
Got my itchy for them niggas tryna get me home (check)
Got my butter right, got the hummer tied (check)
Got that lumber to jump up and take another flight (check)
So what you wanna do, it could be me or you
Or we could play like nothing popping and just keep it cool
We went from hardly speaking, and hardly sleeping, im oddly thinking that he got my body reaching
For places that I never seen before, and by the way I got something for you to see me boy
Chorus
So real so right, wanna get with you tonight, I wanna feel good, feel right, making love to you all night, shawty so fly, baby you stay on my mind, wanna get with you tonight, ritee
Verse 2
Im getting drunk with my bitches, and then he hit me up
He wanna know whats the business, can he come and pick me up
Im looking good as hell and got a babysitter
I see you later yall, im crazy bout this nigga
And dey it ain't really feeling him, yo they be really killing him, illing him, and grilling him
But yo Im silly digging him
And I be going so on and on and, cause he keep me moaning from night to morning
Calling your phone when im knowing you ain't home, sorry
But baby I dont wanna be alone shawty, get at me just as soon as you get in
Pumping janet in the background and im sipping hen
With some nice little something with straps on my legs
Can you blind fold, tie me to the strap on the bed, let my legs spread stretch em to the back of my head, is you playing boy maybe you forgot what I said, can you dig?
Chorus
So real so right, wanna get with you tonight, I wanna feel good, feel right, making love to you all night, shawty so fly, baby you stay on my mind, wanna get with you tonight, ritee
Verse 3
And everytime I see, I wanna be all up on him, and I want him all up in me
And when I move through the city, I want him rolling with me
I can't explain how he feel and how his body fit me
We stick together whatever like its bobby and whitney, thats through the thick and thin
Soaking and stick it in, joking and kicking it, smoking and stick it --, I swear to god though
I been feeling shawty from the start though, fuck around and got me for my heart though
But im good with it, cause he keep it hood with it, and he ain't afraid to beat it up like he should with it, got the chevy pulled in it, and I love when we ride, throw them thangs up shawty, put yo guns in the sky, I be down for my nigga like im down for my team, stay around for my nigga
While he down for the beam, we just keep it trill, we dont need no child or no ring, for the time being , got me going wild on some things naa mean
Chorus
So real so right, wanna get with you tonight, I wanna feel good, feel right, making love to you all night, shawty so fly, baby you stay on my mind, wanna get with you tonight, ritee
