Down my back, big and fat
Down my back, big and fat
Down my back, big and fat
Down my back

I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
Hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
She can't do it like this
She can't do it like that

I keep my tats all on my neck, tats all on my back
Gucci all on my feet, stacks all in my lap
Your man wish he could fuck, your bitch wish she could lick
A slut gone be a slut, a trick gone be a trick
I keep my drank all in my cup, gloss all on my lips
Coup parked in the front, Audemar on my wrist
Two bad bitches on deck, one Chocolate one Red
One say she wanna fuck, the other givin’ up plenty
No ménage a trois, five hoes in my car
Got ecstasy, promethazine, we trying to find some mo, where them boys?
Say he want it like this, say he want it like that
But Man that pussy too good
But Man that pussy too fat

I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
Hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
She can't do it like this
She can't do it like that

I keep my hair down my back, that 30 over that blonde
With a one piece that look painted on and a Birkin bag on my arm
With a slash of that bronze, oh my God
My body scent alone known to get a nigga dick hard
I keep that loud in the extension
My name all in your mansions
My song all in your iPod, I’mma stand up bitch no tripod
I got your nigga comin’ to get me
All my bitches with me
Deep as hell in this Bentley
On our way up in the 50

I keep my choppers on beam
I’mma dope dealers dream
And my ass so fat, I swear it’s bustin’ out the seam
Hair all down my back, 500 a pack
I’m a high class hood rat
And my ass big and fat

I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
Hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
I keep my hair all down my back
Ass big and fat
She can't do it like this
She can't do it like that
