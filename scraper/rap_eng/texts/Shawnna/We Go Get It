We go get it, we go get it
We go get it, we go get it
We go get it, we go get it
We go get it, we go get it

We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it
We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it
We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it
We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it

I’m hoppin’ out that Hummer truck
I’m Louie V’d, I’m duffled up
I’m on that lean, I’m double cupped
I hold that thing, I’m double tuff
You dumb as fuck sayin’ we ain’t rich
She all that but she ain’t this
Sip on spades, you sip on chris
I sit on suede, you sit on bench
Get money, I get dough
Get with it or get low
Ridin’, rollin’ my whip slow
Slow mo when I tip toe
Oh no, the bitch back again
Blackin’ out on them tracks again
Club jumpin’, we packs it in
Gucci bag that my stacks is in
And I know he wanna hit it
Know he wanna get it
Beat it up then seed it up
What I need to touch them digits?
My team touchin’ them Figgas
Mean muggin’ these niggas
We ain’t bluffing, machine up and this thing fucked and we winners
Saying I'll eat you rappers for dinner
Boss Home of the winner
I don’t know what your bitch about
But my whole squad a go get ‘er
Pourin’ out that liquor
Rolling up my swisher
That’s Lstreetz and that’s Murda Meek
And that’s blunt a bitch and we get ‘em

We go get it, we go get it
We go get it, we go get it
We go get it, we go get it
We go get it, we go get it

We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it
We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it
We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it
We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it

We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it
We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it
We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it
We go (we go) get it, we go (we go) get it
