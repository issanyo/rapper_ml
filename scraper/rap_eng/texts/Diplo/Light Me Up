[Verse 1: Miguel]
You can dry your tears, every tide must change
Calm your fears, you can climb again
We forget that it's so easy to love when everything is good
Don't compare, 'cause every sea sees rain
While you're here, just know I'll hold your hand
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
And I will guide you
Let me remind you
Heights I would fly to
Depths I would dive to
Yeah, I'll always find you

[Chorus: Miguel]
So baby, light me up
You can breathe me in
I'ma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, yeah, oh
Yeah, baby, light me up
You can breathe me in
I'ma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, yeah

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
Sure, we have our fights
Sure, we have our doubts
Sure, we lie, but we're not lying now
We know why
'Cause it's so easy to love when everything is good
Hold my skin, hold me in your hands
Let's begin, to give you all I am
Mmm, to give you all I am

[Pre-Chorus: Julia Michaels]
And I will guide you
Let me remind you
Heights I would fly to
Depths I would dive to
Yeah, I'll always find you (I'll always find you)

[Chorus: Miguel & Julia Michaels, Miguel]
So baby, light me up
You can breathe me in
I'ma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, yeah, oh
Yeah, baby, light me up
You can breathe me in
I'ma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, yeah
Until the quiet comes

[Bridge: Miguel & Julia Michaels]
La, de, da, da, da, da
You and I should drag our names across the sky, yeah, yeah
You and I, across the sky, across the sky, babe, yeah
La, de, da, da, da, da
Baby, baby
So what if we don't even have to try?
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
No, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: Miguel & Julia Michaels, Miguel]
So baby, light me up
You can breathe me in
I'ma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, yeah, oh
Yeah, baby, light me up
You can breathe me in
I'ma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, yeah
Until the quiet comes
