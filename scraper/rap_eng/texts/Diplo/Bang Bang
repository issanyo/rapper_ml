[Chorus: R. City]
Bang bang
You knock me down
I hit the ground
I can't get back up, ka-
Bang bang
You knock me down
I hit the ground
(Pull up!)
Bang bang
You knock me down
I hit the ground
I can't get back up, ka-
Bang bang
You knock me down
I hit the ground
I can't get back up, ka-
Bang

[Verse 1: R. City]
Well they call me a murderer
If you let me get too close, I will be hurtin' ya
When I got you feeling good, back off from a gal you should
Iâ€™m in a bedroom criminal police should lock me up

[Pre-Chorus: Selah Sue]
I feel your heartbeat
Every day and every night, every night
And your love kills me
Kills me like a homicide, homicide
I can't live, can't breath
I just need you by my side, by my side
Cause your love kills me
Kills me like a homicide, homicide
Like a homicide

[Chorus: R. City & Craig David]
Bang bang
You knock me down
I hit the ground
I can't get back up, ka-
Bang bang
You knock me down
I hit the ground
Yes! Let me hear a dub plate
Yo, Craig David, now

[Verse 2: Craig David]
Bang, bang, hit the ground
It's emergency here, man down
Light it up like champion sound
DJ press wheel-up, and come back 'round
Never thought that you would do me like that
After holding you down up in these streets
Especially as it was only last night
You were looking back at me in my sheets, yeah (Bang Bang)
It feels like nobody knows
Blood staining out my clothes, bullet hit me with such force
(Bang Bang) I never felt this before
When you pull out your gun and let the bullet go
Shoot in my heart and once I hit the floor

[Pre-Chorus: Selah Sue]
I feel your heartbeat
Every day and every night, every night
And your love kills me
Kills me like a homicide, homicide
I can't live, can't breath
I just need you by my side, by my side
Cause your love kills me
Kills me like a homicide, homicide
Like a homicide

[Chorus: R. City]
Bang bang
You knock me down
I hit the ground
I can't get back up, ka-
Bang bang
You knock me down
I hit the ground

[Breakdown: R. City & Craig David]
Bang bang
Bang bang
Oh, I..
Bang bang
You knock me down
I hit the ground
I can't get back up, ka-
Bang bang
Oh, yeah, hit the ground
Bang Bang
