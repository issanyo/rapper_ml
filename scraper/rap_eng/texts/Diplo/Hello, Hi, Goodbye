[Intro]
Hello, hi, goodbye (So I'm sayin')
Hello, hi, goodbye (Sayin')
Hello, hi, goodbye (Sayin')
Hello, hi, goodbye (Sayin')

[Verse 1]
Imagine a future of you and me
Seems good and then you leave
The pain in this prison killin' me
Reality is, we will never be
I'm prone to a love travesty
And this feels like another tragedy
And the truth really is
We're too young to understand love's demands
Love express will take you up five flights
And let you go and then crash
No replyin' from the ash
We'll just be burning up after that

[Pre]
I'll hate you (or)
You'll hate me (or)
I'll take you (or)
You'll break me (or)
And now I'm scared
'Cause I've been there
Stuck in this prison
No optimism
And now it's

[Chorus]
Hello, hi, goodbye
My heart has no room for love
Hello, hi, goodbye
My heart fell, no getting up
Hello, hi, goodbye
Any other time I'd be yours
But that thing in me is gone

[Verse 2]
I know you wish somehow I could explain
I'm still numb from the pain
And I don't wanna know your name
Please get up and walk away
I don't wanna fall in love again
Don't wanna start anything that could end
I know you think you can get through to me
But I'm on lock in love's penitentiary
I already know how this goes
Lay it down, broken, heartbroke

[Pre]
I'll hate you (or)
You'll hate me (or)
I'll take you (or)
You'll break me (or)
And now I'm scared
'Cause I've been there
Stuck in this prison
No optimism
And now it's

[Chorus]
Hello, hi, goodbye
My heart has no room for love
Hello, hi, goodbye
My heart fell, no getting up
Hello, hi, goodbye
Any other time I'd be yours
But that thing in me is gone

[Outro]
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
