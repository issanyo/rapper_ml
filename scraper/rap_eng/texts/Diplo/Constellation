[Verse 1 (spoken)]
You say you don't know what you're doing
Oh, is it so confusing?
You fall asleep in last night's clothes and call me in the morning
And somewhere down the line, it sounds like you're crying
You're so tired, and tired of trying
It's okay!

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can fall apart
And send every light from every star
Constellation around your heart
And I could never find the words to say
So let the stars spell out, the stars spell out...

[Chorus]
It will be okay
It will be okay
It will be okay
It will be okay
