[Verse 1: Young B]

Everybody wanna know how I do it
Back in this bitch yeah how yall doin?
Got a real bad bitch with a big booty
Im goin dumber than a muhfuckin looney
Yeah this the remix hoe
I dont make it rain bitch I make it snow
Got yo girl all on the floor
If u didn't know then now u know, oh
Whatchu talkin bout girl? You ain't bout shit
And fuck what you say, girl I give your mouth dick
Im the motherfucker they call sick
You're the motherfucker they call bitch
Tell my girl to hop out of them clothes
And get up on this tall dick
She gettin wet, all over my seat
Ain't no light, she don't want me to see
Man Im on, fuck her to my own beat
When she on man she a real freak
Ain't nobody doin it better than me
She met with me now she ready for the E
Popped some E and now she's ready for the D
That's what you get when u fuckin with B
When I roll up, *click clack* to yo neck
Then I take yo bitch back to my set
Then I go dumb (Brrraa) with the tech
Killin errybody I dont care what I get
I dont give a fuck about your weak ass flow
Fuckboi u mad you a weak ass hoe
Fuck that bitch like really slow
Then speed it up a bit and let it go
