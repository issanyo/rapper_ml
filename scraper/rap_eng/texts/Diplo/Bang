[Chorus]
Bang it up and bang, bang it up and bang
Bang it up and bang, bang it up and
Bang it up and bang, bang it up and bang
Bang it up and bang, bang it up and
Burn a lot, baby
Start a fire
We'll make a bang

[Verse 1]
I told you one bang
You won't forget about me
Now here's a second bang
You won't regret it baby
Just let me work my magic
Or take your time pretty
A paper fly six over
Caught a man on next table
Hey boy, you only should do
I'll make a bang

[Chorus]
Bang it up and bang, bang it up and bang
Bang it up and bang, bang it up and
Bang it up and bang, bang it up and bang
Bang it up and bang, bang it up and
Burn a lot, baby
Start a fire
We'll make a bang

[Verse 2]
Yes, it's party good friends for me
Little bit of this, little dance is on me
Right man, wrong man, white man, cow man
Round man, black man, dope man, crack man
Coke man, stab man, stop man
Gun man, running man, running on the track man
Coming for you like a man hungry
Trying eat like pac man
I don't know how to act man
Titty cat, jimmy hat, titty fat, jimmy cat
Gimme that, gimme that some lack
Jimmy rat, gimme that, gimme that

[Chorus]
We'll make a, we'll make a, we'll make a, we'll make a
We'll make a, we'll make a,we'll make a, we'll make a bang
We'll make a bang
We'll make a bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,bang
Burn a lot, baby
Start a fire
We'll make a bang
