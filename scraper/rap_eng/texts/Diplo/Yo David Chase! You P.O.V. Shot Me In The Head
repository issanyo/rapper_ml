Yo David Chase! You P.O.V. shot me in the head!
If only you could see me with my P.O.V
Feel my P.O.V. shot in the head
Resuscitate me from my P.O.V
Cause all we can see is black instead
Lets go!
You don't see nothing and I don't see nothing
You can't see nothing and I don't see nothing
You can't see nothing and I can't see nothing
And for once we don't understand one another!
P.O.V. shot in the head
