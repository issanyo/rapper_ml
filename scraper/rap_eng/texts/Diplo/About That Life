She's just my type
She doing right
She go all night
I seen the light

Got my feet on the ground, my head in the clouds
My feet on the ground, my head in the clouds [X2]
I'm feel the sun, do you hear that sound

I step outside
I slip and slide
I don't know why
I'm about that life

It's a new horizon, now I know who I am
It's a new religion, yeah it takes me away

Got my feet on the ground, my head in the clouds
My feet on the ground, my head in the clouds [X2]
I'm feel the sun, do you hear that sound

Got my feet on the ground, my head in the clouds
My feet on the ground, my head in the clouds [X4]
