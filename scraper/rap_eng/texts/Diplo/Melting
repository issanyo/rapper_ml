[Verse 1]
You are my church
You are my place of worship
I heard you're the plug, can I be the circuit?
When I got court, I hope that you're the verdict
When you're around, my insides turn inverted
My blood start to rush when I see you, doorman
I know you're nearby and I know your purpose
Take one look at you
You're heaven's incarnate
What is this spell, baby?
Please show some mercy

[Chorus]
Melting like an ice cream when you smile
Melting, you're a daydream
Stay a while

[Verse 2]
I pray that I can learn to be funny
I'm watching every stand-up comedy
Just hoping that it will rub off on me
So you'll smile at everything I say
You got some soft lips and some pearly whites (pearly whites)
I wanna touch them in the dead of night (dead of night)
Your smile ignites just like a candlelight (candlelight)
Then somehow I know everything's alright

[Chorus]
Melting like an ice cream when you smile
Melting, you're a daydream
Stay a while

Melting like an ice cream when you smile
Melting, you're a daydream
Stay a while
