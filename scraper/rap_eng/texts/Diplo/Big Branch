Big bad wolf came over to my ranch
Took all my land, left me with a branch
That's how I feel about the loving that I had
That's how I know about the girls he had

Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
I'll put her on the table
And I'll put her in my claw
I'll put her down my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And I'll drop her to the floor

Big, big, big branch
Big branch
I'll hit her with the motherfucking branch
Big, big, big
I'll hit her with the motherfucking branch

Men are like pearls, they look good with my curls
I string em to get the best necklace in the world
In the state of the world all women wanna lay
It's man's world but I keep him at bay
You can fuck a man, mack a man, tell 'em that you're gay
Tell him real love ain't on BET
Sex is so cheap, I get it at KFC
When its meaningless why they do R&B

Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
I'll put her on the table
And I'll put her in my claw
I'll put her down my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And I'll drop her to the floor

Big, big, big branch
Big branch
I'll hit her with the motherfucking branch
Big, big, big
I'll hit her with the motherfucking branch

Eat my chips and I wash that plate
Thought about women that take that bait
Men with stamina or money on the plate
Can get a woman thinking her period is late
Thanks to Jesus, I got my own estate
If I let you in, will you run off with my maid?
All men are just so fickle these days
To find a really good one I keep on getting laid

Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
I'll put her on the table
And I'll put her in my claw
I'll put her down my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And I'll drop her to the floor

Big, big, big branch
Big branch
I'll hit her with the motherfucking branch

Big wolf
