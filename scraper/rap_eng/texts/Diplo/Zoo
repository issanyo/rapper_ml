[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Last night, me and my squad went zoo
Cliqued up and multiplied by two
Know they watch, I gotta watch my moves
But last night me and my squad went zoo, woo
Last night, me and my squad went zoo
Cliqued up and multiplied by two
Know they watch, I gotta watch my moves
But last night me and my squad went zoo

[Verse 1]
Last night we had this bitch lit
Last night we had your bitch lit
Bottle poppin' with the clique, clique
All because she know the clique lit
Way, way, way too lit, yeah
Way, way, way too bent, yeah
Sideline, they watchin'
Multiply my pockets

[Chorus]
Last night, me and my squad went zoo
Cliqued up and multiplied by two
Know they watch, I gotta watch my moves
But last night me and my squad went zoo, woo
Last night, me and my squad went zoo
Cliqued up and multiplied by two
Know they watch, I gotta watch my moves
But last night me and my squad went zoo

[Verse 2]
Last night, we had it loco (it's lit)
Faded off them coco losos
I skipped four, I'm pourin' ocho
She keep actin' like she don't know I'm...
Way, way, way too lit, yeah
Way, way, way too bent, yeah
If you ain't, be quiet
Don't knock it 'til you try it

[Chorus]
Last night, me and my squad went zoo
Cliqued up and multiplied by two
Know they watch, I gotta watch my moves
But last night me and my squad went zoo, woo
Last night, me and my squad went zoo
Cliqued up and multiplied by two
Know they watch, I gotta watch my moves
But last night me and my squad went zoo

[Outro]
Last night, me and my squad went zoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Cliqued up and multiplied by two
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Know they watch, I gotta watch my moves
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But last night me and my squad went zoo, woo
Yeah
