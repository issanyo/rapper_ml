[Chorus]
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, she's got criminal intent
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, she's got criminal intent
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent

[Verse 1]
- Will the defendant please rise? State your full name for the record
- Robyn
- Do you wish to say anything before the sentence is imposed?
- I do your Honor!

[Verse 2]
You know, from time to time
I need to get down (down)
Unwind and just bump and grind (grind)
Get my shot on, have some fun
A little dirty never hurt anyone (one)
I admit, I can get somewhat X-rated on the floor
But your Honor, how's that something you get incarcerated for?

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I done nothing that's wrong
Way better by degrees some-something that's frowned upon
I object most strongly Judge, they played my song

[Chorus]
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, she's got criminal intent
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Somebody alert the authorities, she's got criminal intent
Cr-Cr-criminal intent
Cr-Cr-criminal intent

[Verse 3]
Y-yo-yo Judge, may the record reflect the fact
I don't have any priors
Besides, would you pardon me
For being inappropriately attired?
But yo, listen, them cuffs down at county
Totally ripped up my pantyhose
And some snitch punk at legal aid
Stole my voucher for court clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
I done nothing that's wrong
Way better by degrees some-something that's frowned upon
I object most strongly Judge, they played my song

[Chorus]
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, she's got criminal intent
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Somebody alert the authorities, she's got criminal intent
Criminal intent, criminal
