[Chorus: Daniel Merriweather]
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get-

[Post-Chorus: Daniel Merriweather]
Unless we feel
Unless we feel
Unless we feel
Start to feel it
Feel it, ooh babe
Feel it, hey, feel it

[Chorus: Daniel Merriweather]
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get-

[Post-Chorus: Daniel Merriweather]
Feel it, ooh baby
Feel it, ooh baby
Feel it, ooh baby
Feel it, ooh baby
Feel it

[Chorus: Daniel Merriweather]
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get better
Only can get-
