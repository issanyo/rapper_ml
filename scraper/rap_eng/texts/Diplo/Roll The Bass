[Intro]
Now in comes di ting called
Major Lazer number one sound inna dancehall
We stand tall, soundboy diss and fall
That's all, brr

[Verse 1]
We ready fi di war
I can see di fear in a ya eyes, I can smell the desperation
But we have dubplates galore
Major Lazer sound, yes a we rule the nation
Tonight a little drum pan will die
Soundboy eradication
And it no really matter what you try

[Pre-Chorus]
Stiggy-diggy-diggy-don
Well reggae music a di peoples' choice
Use this rhythm and make your sound play nice

[Chorus 1]
A Major Lazer
A knock down di place
Now di time to test out di bass
Now make it roll, roll, roll, roll, roll...
Now make it, now make it

[Pre-Chorus]
Stiggy-diggy-diggy-don
Well reggae music a di peoples' choice
Use this rhythm and make your sound play nice

[Chorus 2]
A Major Lazer
A knock down di place
Now di time to test out di bass
Now make it

[Verse]
We ready fi di war
I can see di fear in a ya eyes, I can smell the desperation
But we have dubplates galore
Major Lazer sound, yes a we rule the nation
Tonight a little drum pan will die
Soundboy eradication
And it no really matter what you try

[Pre-Chorus Extended]
Tonight a little drum pan will die
Soundboy eradication
And it no really matter what you try
This is your final destination

[Chorus 1]
A Major Lazer
A knock down di place
Now di time to test out di bass
Now make it roll, roll, roll, roll, roll...
Now make it, now make it
