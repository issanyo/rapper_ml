[Verse 1]
You can watch TV and watch the media
President Bush doing takeover
Kate Moss in ads for mascara
All my youth the young offender
The bill payers, the drug dealers
Girls who are magazine covers
The part-time jobbers at the call center
No career plans cause you won't go far
Put away change for Ibiza and
Check your credit on your new Nokia

[Hook]
You can be a follower but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya
You can be a follower but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya
You leader, you lead, uh, do what you do
What really good's gonna happen to you?
You leader, you lead, uh, do what you do
What really good's gonna happen to you?

[Verse 2]
Your prime minister to your employer
Ego lovers need more power
Trendsetters make things better
Don't sell out to be product pushers
The gyro casher and baby makers
Try something new cause it ain't over
All poor people from all over
Lottery's got a rollover

[Hook]
You can be a follower but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya
You can be a follower but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya

[Verse 3]
Cherokee Indian, Iraqi and Indians
Girls and me girls when they come to the fellas and
Japanese, Moroccan, Caribbean, African
That's your life but who the fuck's your president?
You don't get my life cause I don't have a side and I
Spread dat boy 'im a mile wide and I
Got brown skin, I'm a west Londoner
Educated, but a refugee, still
You wanna boy, you're old, you go
You wanna fight, you suck, you blow

[Interlude]
N-n-n-n-nah, n-n-nah, n-nah, n-nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, n-nah, n-nah
Ay! Ay!
