[Verse 1]
Warrior, your venom is erotic but wrong
I know the void's been evil
But songs still on the radio, to go
To let us know we're not alone
Gaia is grey, and I'm a grisly one
The dream's got a grab on me
And I'm in too strong
I can't hold on to your touch
But I remember how it was

[Chorus]
Every night was cold as I
So you hold me close to your heart
Mine is back
I wanna go, I wanna go back
Every night was cold as I
So you hold me close to your heart
Red in the grey
I wanna go, I wanna go
Back to you someday

[Verse 2]
Warrior, like you're the one having no fear
In the veneer, you hear the songs and the spears
But I know how hard it is to choose your battles
Searching for the mark, unwind the pages
And the dream's got a grab on me
And I'm in too deep
I can't hold on to your touch
But I remember how it was oh
Oh
Pretty lilies, golden stars
We're surrounded by them
In the house of our hearts
Pretty lilies, dreams were all it was
And I had to run from your love

[Chorus]
Every night was cold as I
So you hold me close to your heart
Mine is back (mine is back)
I wanna go, I wanna go back
Every night was cold as I
So you hold me close to your heart
Red in the grey
I wanna go, I wanna go
Back to you someday
Oh
