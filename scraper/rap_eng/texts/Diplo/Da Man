[Verse 1]
I'm half as bright in my afterlife
Slap a wife with a stack of knives
Jack the White, outta crack is pipe
Resurrect and come back as Christ
My lungs are black as ice
Asian eyes like a nigga rap for rice
Don't give me advice like an add of spice
If the bitch bilingual, she can grab the mic
I'm [?] this mic and I'm glad you like
I don't even need the padding right
I get high, got a bag of kites
Hodgy dad ignite, see them flashing light
I gotta roll a spliff to breathe
Lighting up trees like it's New Year's Eve
Don't try to fight with me, I'm cool as breeze
If you have any questions, why don't you go ask G's

[Hook]
This is the part, this is the part
This is the part where I jam
I got the mic in my hand
My dick in my other hand
Bitch I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man
Tell everybody, tell everybody

[Verse 2]
This ain't my track but I made it mine
If the bitch on the move call it saving's time
I like my H2O with a squeeze of lime
I like 2H-O-E-S fine like wine
I snapchatted my cock, she can suck it on Vine
Relax, lay on your back, one of my favorite lines
First I met her at the club, had a couples drinks, then we left
We headed to the crib, taking off her mink, you know what's next
She in her lingerie, I'm wishing her the best
Oh this is your fiance? She told me she's your ex
With this pussy I'm a vet, get it wet
Get it checkerboard, I'm gonna let you pet
