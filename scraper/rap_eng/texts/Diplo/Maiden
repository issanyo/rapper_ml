[Verse 1]
My desire is ravaging in me
I see purple mass, stardust light
Dancing in your eyes
What is the use?
Where can I start, when all of you find me crazy 'cause I have a black heart?

[Chorus]
So what you know about being the best one?
I will never see
And what they said about me from time to time will never be true
(Never, never)
Nevermore, nevermore
Nevermore, nevermore

[Verse 2]
My desire is ravaging in me like a warrior’s blade
Proud and fine
Let victory be mine
What if I choose to tear down the walls and take you in my arms, sweet sunbeam, though I’m not perfect at all?
(Never, never)

[Chorus]
So what you know about being the best one?
I will never see
And what they said about me from time to time will never be true
(Never, never)
Nevermore, nevermore
I am a maiden for you
Nevermore
I am a maiden, nevermore
I am a maiden, nevermore
I am a maiden
I am a maiden for you, nevermore
Nevermore
