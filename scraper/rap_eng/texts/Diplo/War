[Chorus: Example]
No matter what they say, we'll do it anyway
And you can shoot us down but we were born this way
We go to war each day, it seems to call our name
Down the same old road again

Down the same old road again
Down the same old road again

[Chorus: Example]

Baby, here's where the story ends
Down the same old road again

[Verse: Example]
Baby, here's where the story ends
Down the same old road again
Down the same old road again
Down the same old road again

[Chorus: Example]

Down the same old road again

[Verse: Example]
