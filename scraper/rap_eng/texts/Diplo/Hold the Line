[Verse 3: Santigold]
I know my brain is much bigger than your stock
When I go spittin', never want me to stop
I got that fire in me ready to explode
And when it happens feel the wrath of my load
Like, 'Damn woman! You got me, yeah, you get up on top'
Like, 'Damn! How you do it with that rhythm you got?'
Well now I'm drivin' till you get out on the road
I wind you up, wind you, leave you shiverin' cold
Now I'm much better than you
You really wanna get, you wanna get
You tremblin' up from the mix, eh
Baby, you better sit down
Fling it back mek yuh wanna get off di ground, yea
Doh pretend like I doh hear yuh when yuh pick up
I love it down when you think about me
All you fuckin' round busy bad boys, forget about me

[Hook: Santigold]

I make ya', I make ya', I make, I make ya', I make ya'
I make ya' jeans vibrate like a Nokia
