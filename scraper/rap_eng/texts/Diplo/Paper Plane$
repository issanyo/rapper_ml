[Verse 1}:
There is nobody that can do it like Mad
Always been a hustler I ain't never had a job
They tell me go to college but I find that it is flawed
My dreams shall be achieved, all I do is work hard
Imma win a Grammy and run the whole show
Haters so surprised when they see me go pro
Pretty good kid, no I never did smoke
'Bout to be rich like I made and sold coke
Man I love making money I could never get enough
I wanna cream pie Hillary Duff
If that's too much than I wanna hug her jugs
Lemme calm down right now I'm cuffed
Stay in my lane, all these haters throwing shade
Used to call me lame now they working like slaves
Doing what I love, now I'm 'bout to get paid
Turn the music up, time to jam all day

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money

[Refrain]:
Sticks, and stones, and bones
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
Chilling I'm in my zone
Pack of gum semi-automatic pistol
Sticks, and stones, and bones
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
Chilling I'm in my zone
Pack of gum semi-automatic pistol

[Verse 2]:
Gotta get this paper, stay fly like planes
Rich as EA though I play no games
Driving reckless but I'm staying in my lane
Live with no regrets, man I have no shame
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Feen for women with the pretty face, big butt
Infatuated, yea, I know that it is lust
But I promise you in the sheets it's love

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money

[Bridge]
M.I.A
Third world democracy
Yeah, I've got more records than the K.G.B
So, uh, no funny business
Are you ready all?
(Sticks, and stones, and bones)
Some some some I some I murder
Some I some I let go
(Chilling I'm in my zone)
Some some some I some I murder
Some I some I let go

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money
