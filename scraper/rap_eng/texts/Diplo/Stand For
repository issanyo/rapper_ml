[Intro]
If you believe in somethin', then stand for it

[Verse 1]
Said I stand for my niggas doin' life
Free my niggas right right now
And I stand for my bitches doin' right
Up early cookin' breakfast, comin' home at night
Stand for my niggas on the bottom
Never went to college but they're full of street knowledge, hell yeah
I stand for my niggas, I ride for my niggas, die for my niggas
Big P was the first one to say
"You the one, lil' nigga"
And a few years later
We won, lil' nigga
Fuck whatever they're doin'
We outdone them niggas
And I stand for this shit
A bitch nigga try me, I've been prayin' for this shit
God dammit I stand for
Everything I stand for
Bad bitches and a whole lot of stamps
In my passport
Nigga I stand for
Never seen me on the stand though
Nigga I stand for
Ask your bitch, she know I'm the man though

[Hook]
I be standin' on couches, in the club
Spillin' liquor
Standin' up while I'm fuckin'
My bitches
I'm a stand up nigga
You a real nigga, I'll stand up with you
I'm a stand up nigga
Told my bitch I'll spend these bands up with you
I'm a stand up nigga
You a real nigga, I'll stand up with you
I'm a stand up nigga
Told my bitch I'll spend these bands up with you

[Bridge]
Stand for makin' dough, stand for takin' dough
Stand for what I know
Stand for my niggas on these blocks

[Verse 2]
All my bitches buyin' green dots
Young niggas in the weed spot
Tryna get the money for the whip
Lil' nigga in the g ride
He ain't got no money for no whip
Ghostride that shit, real nigga gon' provide that shit
He gon' do whatever for the bread
Fuck your point, it's beside that shit
Either you stand for somethin' or fall for nothin'
This shit is simple, no discussion
Your bitch is disgustin'
She know I love it, I'm always fuckin'
Until I'm bustin'

[Hook]
I be standin' on couches, in the club
Spillin' liquor
Standin' up while I'm fuckin'
My bitches
I'm a stand up nigga
You a real nigga, I'll stand up with you
I'm a stand up nigga
Told my bitch I'll spend these bands up with you
I'm a stand up nigga
You a real nigga, I'll stand up with you
I'm a stand up nigga
Told my bitch I'll spend these bands up with you
