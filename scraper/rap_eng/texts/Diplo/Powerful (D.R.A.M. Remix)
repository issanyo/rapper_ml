[Verse 1: D.R.A.M.]
I compare our love to ferris wheels
We go through ups and our downs but still we come back around hey
Its like we form this sort of force field, like when we go out together we shuttin' everything down
If its less lets just call it that - hey, but since its love I'm always calling back, running back, all of that
We ain't no scientists, but we got chemistry
And every time I plug your socket we make energy

[Chorus: Tarrus Riley & Ellie Goulding]
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful

[Verse 2: Ellie Goulding]
I couldn't leave even if I wanted to
'Cause something keeps pulling me back to you
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
The stroke of your fingers, the scent of you lingers
My mind running wild, the thoughts of your smile
Oh, you gotta give me some
And you could give it all, but it's never enough, no

[Pre-Chorus: Tarrus Riley]
Oh, lord, have mercy, I'm begging you, please
I'm feeling drained, I need love
You charge me up like electricity
Jump-start my heart with your love

[Chorus: Tarrus Riley & Ellie Goulding]
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful

[Outro: Tarrus Riley & Ellie Goulding]
There's an energy (energy, energy, energy, energy), so powerful (powerful)
So powerful (powerful)
There's an energy (energy, energy, energy, energy)
Energy, energy
So powerful (powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful)
