[Hook: SMG]

Going nowhere fast. We’ve reached the climax
Were together now we’re undone
Won’t commit so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Don’t wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can’t take it back. It’s too late
We’ve reached the climax
Climax

[Verse 1: SMG]

I've
Fallen under your spell
Remember all nights we went out with them, all I saw was you and ourselves
Got me in my feelings
Seduce me, unreduce me, produce me, you, and a laugh when it's true
Cause no one smiles like that, too
Shit
Not even you anymore
Now even fights are bored
Now this dying flame turns to hell
And it burns me inside
Keeping your heart warm, and
I'm on my knees, but it seems we're

[Hook: SMG]

[Verse 2: SMG]

Come on, wake up
I know you've fallen by now
Wish I were too, but my heart is aloud
See, my thoughts don't age, only change;
Resuscitate with lonely, lung-deep breaths like hallelujahs
All because you fucked it up
All because you couldn't pick lust or love
Now I'm lying here with my head in my hands still looking for a sign from above
Pulling all the stops like
How many clocks does a nigga have to wish on?
Turkey tug of wars and rusted '95 Lincolns
Been livin' for the weak, and
Been livid for some weeks, givin' so that we can just
Hit a wall
Recall
Resolve
Still fall to

[Verse 3: Didier]

Did you see my picture posted? The one I took
You didn’t like it, but I know you looked
Rolling squad deep, like Mobb Deep, but I ain’t shook
High stakes love, a bet not even a bookie’d book
Look, you played me good, like the percussion
No strings attached, right? Then, why you blushing?
Worked me, hurt me, this hussy likes hustling
We had something, had, fuck you, now we nothing
And you left me once, didn’t think twice
If it’s right to go left, then I go left, right?
Started a fight and that ended our night, and that fight ended my life
No closure, it’s over, heart froze over, to ice
