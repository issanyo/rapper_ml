[Verse]
Open
Living for the night like it is golden
Yeah I came to win, I'm never folding
I just wanna dance among the stars
These afterhours got me charged and
Open
Living for the night like it is golden
Yeah I came to win, I'm never folding
I just wanna dance among the stars
These afterhours got me charged and

[Chorus]
I just wanna dance among the stars
I just wanna dance among the stars
I just wanna dance among the stars
These afterhours got me charged
Afterhours got me charged
Afterhours got me charged
Afterhours got me charged

[Verse]
Open
Living for the night like it is golden
Yeah I came to win, I'm never folding
I just wanna dance among the stars
These afterhours got me charged and
Open
Living for the night like it is golden
Yeah I came to win, I'm never folding
I just wanna dance among the stars
These afterhours got me charged

[Bridge]
I just wanna dance among the stars
I just wanna dance among the stars
I just wanna dance among the stars
T-R-O-Y-B-O-I
Afterhours got me charged
Afterhours got me charged
Afterhours got me charged

[Outro]
I just wanna dance among the stars
I just wanna dance among the stars
I just wanna dance among the stars
These afterhours got me charged
I just wanna dance among the stars
I just wanna dance among the stars
