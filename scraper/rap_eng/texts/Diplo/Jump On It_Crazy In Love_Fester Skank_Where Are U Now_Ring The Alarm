[Crazy In Love: Sample]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Crazy In Love: Perrie Edwards and Jesy Nelson
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Crazy In Love: All]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love

[Crazy In Love: Sample]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Fester Skank: Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
You might see me in a Lambo
Camo snapback, Rambo
500 horses, Django
2 2 chicken, Nando
You might see me in a 'Rari
Old school fella, Atari
It's a new dance, no tango
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go
Hey, hey, Fester
Hey, hey, Fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go
Hey, hey, Fester
Hey, hey Fester

[Where Are U Now: Jade Thirlwall]
Where are you now that we need you?

["Where Are U Now" instrumental while the girls dance and hype up the crowd]


[Ring The Alarm: All]
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

[Ring The Alarm: Jade Thirlwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go

[Ring The Alarm: Perrie Edwards and Jesy Nelson]
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go

[Ring The Alarm: Perrie Edwards and Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go

[Ring The Alarm: All]
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go
