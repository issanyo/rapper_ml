[Chorus]
One time Two times
Duo shao lai hui
Tell me then
Bie zai li kai
Chi xu pai huai
Kuai le jiu xian zai
Oh my heart
Zai tiao dong
Rang wo zou jin ni de xin fang
Oh the stars
Beautiful highs
Xin de yi tian where will you go

[Post-Chorus]
It's the same with me and u and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party
So many doors
So many closed to light
Oh baby my heart’s open
U know that I stay open
Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
U know that I stay open for u

[Chorus]
One time Two times
Duo shao lai hui
Tell me then
Bie zai li kai
Chi xu pai huai
Kuai le jiu xian zai
Oh my heart
Zai tiao dong
Rang wo zou jin ni de xin fang
Oh the stars
Beautiful highs
Xin de yi tian where will you go

[Post-Chorus]
It's the same with me and u and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party
So many doors
So many closed to light
Oh baby my heart’s open
U know that I stay open
Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
U know that I stay open for u

[Bridge]
So many doors
So many closed to light
Oh baby my heart's open
U know that I stay open
Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
U know that I stay open for u

[Outro]
U know that I stay open for u
U know that I stay open for u
