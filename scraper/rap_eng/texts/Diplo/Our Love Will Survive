[Intro]
If the sun don't shine
If the world's on fire
If the oceans rise
Our love will survive
Our love will survive

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna see you cry
So baby, let me dry your eyes
I'll be by your side
If the world stops spinning round
And heaven falls to the ground
I'll be by your side

[Chorus]
If the sun don't shine
If the world's on fire
If the oceans rise
Our love will survive
If the sky falls down
If time runs out
When the trumpet sounds
Our love will survive

[Verse 2]
Thunder and lightning
Fussing and fighting
Oh well, it don't bother me
Trials and tribulations
Sweep through the nations
But your love is all I see

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna see you cry
So baby, let me dry your eyes
I'll be by your side
If the world stops spinning round
And heaven falls to the ground
I'll be by your side

[Chorus]
If the sun don't shine
If the world's on fire
If the oceans rise
Our love will survive
If the sky falls down
If time runs out
When the trumpet sounds
Our love will survive

[Outro]
If the sun don't shine (our love will survive)
If the world's on fire (our love will survive)
If the oceans rise (our love will survive)
Our love will survive (our love will survive)
If the sky falls down (our love will survive)
If time runs out (our love will survive)
When the trumpet sounds (our love will survive)
Our love will survive (our love will survive)
