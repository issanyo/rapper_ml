Callin' me high on the telephone
Came by plane all alone
Spend the afternoon making a speech
Speech made you nervous that you couldn't eat
You came to show your mad love
You came to tell it's not enough
Come and erase me and take me with you
Kiss me I'm drunk, don't worry it's true
I wanted to show you how mad is my love
Come and attack me it's not gonna hurt
Fight me, deny me if I fear when you're close
Let's make love and listen Death From Above

You knew my ideas when they were in my head
They were my secret evening plans
Wine then bed then more then again, wine then bed then more then again
Run run run, to make your heart shake
Kiss kiss kiss, will make this earth quake
I'm gonna get what I'm willin' to take
This gotta worth the miles you made
Come back, I'll warm you up
Make me breakfast, I'll make it up
You are so talented, I'm in love
Let's make love and listen Death From Above

I'm back with a smack, and I'm ready to attack
Stare at my lips and see they are wet
I know how you're doing by looking at your pants
And this is how we call it a comeback

Screaming your name on the microphone
Going back home all alone
Listen to the tunes that you sent to me
Listen to them good company
I want to show my mad love
You have to know it's not enough
Come and complete me, stay here with me
This is all true, it's water I drink
I want you to show me how mad is your love
Come and attack me it's not gonna hurt
Fight me, deny me if I fear when you're close
Let's make love and listen Death From Above
