Come again, come again...
Major Lazer

[Chorus]
Pon de floor

[Bridge]
Ladies, get in line
Let me see your bestest wine
Ladies, get in line
Let me see your bestest wine
Baby, get in line
Let me see your bestest wine
Move every part of your spine
Gimme some of yours
Lemme give you some of mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Pon de floor anyway
Pon de floor anyway
Pon de floor anyway
Pon de floor anyway
Pon de floor, pon de floor
Pon de, pon de, pon de...
Pon, pon, pon, pon....
Pon de floor

[Chorus]
Major Lazer

[Bridge]
Ladies, get in line
Let me see your bestest wine
Ladies, get in line
Let me see your bestest wine
Baby, get in line
Let me see your bestest wine
Move every part of your spine
Gimme some of yours
Lemme give you some of mine
