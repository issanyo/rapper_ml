[Intro]
Up 2 di time
You know it's Vybz Kartel
Some say singer, blinger ...
Who's that girl over there?
I think i need her
Over there

[Verse 1]
Baby!
Come here please
[?]
What is your name
You look like
A Denise, no?
Step in Mercedes
Drop top! you like breeze?
Is your boyfriend weak in the knees?
Kartel will satify your needs
You want cars or SUVs?
Yings with so much ice it makes you sneeze
Come cherry bee-yotch
Smoke some peepee (that's trees)
Speak to the man Kartel
I'll say your name
Baby!
Just turn on the tricks
Them sunbeams
Fully kitted out with rims
That's easy like means and [?]
You're beautiful like songs that sing that they sings
Me and you can do lots of things

[Chorus]
She'll never know
It's a trick
Or this smile i show
It's a trick
O never [?] my [?]
It's a trick
That's how misled
It's a goddamn trick
She'll never know
It's a trick
Judas man for sure
It's a trick
That's how misled
It's a trick!
Aha!

[Verse 2]
Honeybunch!
Can i say that
I hope and pray one day that
Me and you cruise in the Maybach (your sedan)
Wanna white and pat sajak?
Me, your love, i'll never betray that or hell's fire will be my payback
Seventy years from now, i want say
Ma, me and you go way back
Let's exchange contacts
We don't have to sign
Prenuptial contracts
My love is contagious like anthrax
Give me one back
Baby!
Dirty facts
Seems without you
Just can't relax
Three things in my life is certain
Death, you and income tax

[Chorus]
Up 2 di time
She'll never know
It's a trick
Or this smile i show
It's a trick
O never [?] my [?]
It's a trick
That's how misled
It's a goddamn trick
She'll never know
It's a trick
Judas man for sure
It's a trick
That's how misled
It's a trick!
