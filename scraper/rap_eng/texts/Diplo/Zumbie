Me a zumbie, nah me nah lame
Me a fake Jamaican and me smoke cocaine, buh
Me a zumbie from Kentucky
If ya motherfuckers wan' get stuck-y
Listen to Bounty Killer
And me eat your brains on d hill-er
I'm the thriller of Manilla
I like vanilla brains
And I like chocolate brains
It tastes like ice cream
I had a nice dream
Of a bumbalcart rasta and I eat your spleen
I eat your whole body, me like the butty, sucker
You a batty motherfucker, me a zumbie
You can't fuck with me, man
If you're a bad boy, you can't test me
'Cause I eat your zumbie blood like Nestle, quick
And you suck me zumbie dick
(Suck me zumbie dick)

Me a zumbie, me eat your brains
Me a zumbie, me eat your brains
Me a zumbie, nah me nah lame
Me a fake Jamaican and me smoke cocaine, buh

[Verse 2: Andy Milonakis]
Me a zumbie and me face is grey
Me a zumbie and me face is grey
Me a zumbie and me???
'Cause me don't like the HIV
All the batty man, all the gunman
You can't fuck with me, I'm a zumbie man
All the batty man, all the gunman
You can't test me 'cause I'm a zumbie man
I'm the living dead, I'll life off your head
Eat out your brain, eat out your brain
Eat out your brain, me I go eat your brain
Smoke on the chronic, smoke on the chronic
Me a zumbie weed smoker, suck on mi sonic
Zumbie oh zumbie

[Verse 3: Andy Milonakis]
Really can't tell you why, why
Part living and halfie die, die

Me a crazy zumbie cartel
Forget what your mama done said
Me eat all your brains 'til you're dead
Me eat all your brains 'til you're dead
Me eat all your brains 'til you're dead
Me eat all your brains 'til you're dead, dead
Me eat all your brains 'til you're dead
Me a zumbie, crack head
Me eat all your brains 'til you're dead
Me eat all your brains 'til you're dead, dead
Me a zumbie, me a [?] mi ho check out my zumbie flow
When I kick it like this I eat your chicken grits
And I like to eat your brain in a hurry
Like chicken curry
Or oxtail soup
I want to eat your brain in my coupe
'Cause I like to eat the brains then snoop
And develop his skills
