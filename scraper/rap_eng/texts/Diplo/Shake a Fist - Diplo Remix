I'm ready to try this
The centre's a sea pit
I could be wealthy
With nothing to stop me
I'm ready to try this
(I move underwater)
The centre's a sea pit
(I eat water slaughter)
I could be wealthy
(Inside a moon and palace)
With nothing to stop me
(Let's rain another chalice)
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
You said if I tried this
(I'd be teleported)
But when you first tried this
(Your mind de-contorted)
And if this is heaven
(I might have to tell you)
I'm gonna give hell, just
(A quick once over)
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
Before we go any further
I'd like to show you all a game I made up
This game is called 'Sounds Of The Studio'
And it can be played with any record
Including this one you may be surprised
Now if you have a pair of headphones
You better get 'em out and get 'em cranked up
'Cause they're really gonna help you
That's a pure solution
That's my magic potion
That's the incantation
That's a pure solution
That's my magic potion
That's the incantation
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out
Out and out and out
Shake a fist
And let's breathe within, without
