[Verse 1]
A million miles later
We walked through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised, but our hearts will guide us
Together, I know our love's gonna last forever
We're gonna be alright tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what the world throws at us
We'll get back up again
Again

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
I know we'll find a way
Push to the limit with no end in sight
I know we'll find a way, tonight, hold tight

[Verse 3]
We'll live with no limits
We'll dance in the middle of the freezing rain
With you and I in it
We'll survive the eye of a hurricane
Us together, we gotta make this better
We're gonna be alright, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what the world throws at us
We'll get back up again
Again

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
I know we'll find a way
Push to the limit with no end in sight
I know we'll find a way, tonight
Hold tight

[Drop]
Hold tight
Hold tight

[Bridge]
I don't wanna breathe air that you're not breathing
I don't wanna hear if your heart's not beating
If you hurt, then I wanna be the one that's bleeding
It's alright so, so hold on tight

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
I know we'll find a way
Push to the limit with no end in sight
I know we'll find a way, tonight
Hold tight

Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
I know we'll find a way
Push to the limit with no end in sight
I know we'll find a way, tonight
Hold tight
Hold tight
