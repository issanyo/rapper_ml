[Bridge 1: Datsik & Sabi]
When the beat drops, that's when I get low, low
Give it to me raw
Give it-give it to me, slow-slow
I'm just trynna cut
Then I - Then I want you down, down
I'm just tryna cut
Watch me back it up slow

[Bridge 2: Datsik & Sabi]
Watch me back it up slow, slow
Watch me back it up
Watch me back it up slow, slow
Watch me back it up
Watch me back it up slow, slow
Watch me back it up
Watch me back it up slow, slow
Watch me back it up
Watch me back it up
Shake it on that floor

The-the-the-the-these

[Hook: Datsik & Sabi]
Oh! Uh-Oh!
I am barely standing Oh! Uh-Oh!
I am barely standing Oh! Uh-Oh!
I am barely standing!
Barely standing-ing-ing-ing-ing
Back it on up-uh

The-the-the-the-these
