[Verse: Aluna]
Believe me, I could live without you
But I really don't want to
Believe me, I could love without you
But I really don't need to

[Chorus: Aluna]
’Cause leavin' is the hardest thing to do
But being left is harder, yes it's true
But try coming back
How do I get back to you, to you, to you?

[Post-Chorus: Aluna]
How can I get back to you?

’Cause leavin' is the hardest thing to do
But being left is harder, yes it's true
But try coming back
How do I get back to you, to you, to you?


[Post-Chorus: Aluna]
How can I get back to you?
Let me get back to you
Let me get back to you
How can I get back to you?
Let me get back to you
Let me get back to you
Let me get back to you
Let me get back to you
Let me get back to you
