[Verse 1]
You, you tried to play it safe
But I am planning my escape
Yeah you want your picket fence
But I can't even pay the rent

[Chorus]
I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting
I wanna go down, down in history
Everybody's gonna know me when I die
So I don't give a damn if I survive
I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting

[Verse 2]
You keep it slow and steady
I am more then good and ready
And you set on for second place
But I won't even run the race

[Chorus]
I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting
I wanna go down, down in history
Everybody's gonna know me when I die
So I don't give a damn if I survive
I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, ooh ooh

[Chorus]
I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting
I wanna go down, down in history
Everybody's gonna know me when I die
So I don't give a damn if I survive
I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting
