If I told you things I did before, told you how I used to be
Would you go along with someone like me?
If you knew my story word for word, had all of my history
Would you go along with someone like me?

I did before and had my share, it didn't lead nowhere
I would go along with someone like you
It doesn't matter what you did, who you were hanging with
We could stick around and see this night through

And we don't care about the young folks
Talking 'bout the young style
And we don't care about the old folks
Talking 'bout the old style too

And we don't care about our own faults
Talking 'bout our own style
All we care 'bout is talking
Talking only me and you

Usually when things has gone this far people tend to
Disappear
No one will surprise me unless you do
I can tell there's something goin' on, hours seems to
Disappear
Everyone is leaving, I'm still with you

It doesn't matter what we do, where we are going to
We can stick around and see this night through

And we don't care about the young folks
Talking 'bout the young style
And we don't care about the old folks
Talking 'bout the old style too

And we don't care about our own faults
Talking 'bout our own style
All we care 'bout is talking
Talking only me and you

And we don't care about the young folks
Talking 'bout the young style
And we don't care about the old folks
Talking 'bout the old style too

And we don't care about our own faults
Talking 'bout our own style
All we care 'bout is talking
Talking only me and you
Talking only me and you

Talking only me and you
Talking only me and you
