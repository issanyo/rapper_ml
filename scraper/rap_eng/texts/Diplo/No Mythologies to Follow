[Verse 1]
Born free, hanging in the trees
And waiting for the duties coming for me
All we ever do is count the time, following something
Riddles in their diamond rings
Please cure the disease
Come on, baby, get a pretty picture of these
While the world is dreaming about gold
Digging in their holes, oh, digging in their sleepless souls

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me wanna spit on your honor
Go with the bus waiting 'round the corner
To seek the fire and my desires
"If we could all just do as they do!"

[Chorus]
Where, oh, where do we go?
Where the, where the wind blows
We’re the youth on our own
Waiting for our call
Where, oh, where do we go?
Where the, where the wind blows
Generation with no mythologies to follow

[Verse 2]
Born free, who am I to be
When nothing in the world will have to rely on me?
I remember good old times, the starships in your eyes
Now we’re just getting drunk and die

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me wanna waste by your wonder
Only the gods save you when I’m gone
And we walk in fire like every riot
But we do not know what to do

[Chorus]
Where, oh, where do we go?
Where the, where the wind blows
We’re the youth on our own
Waiting for our call
Where, oh, where do we go?
Where the, where the wind blows
Generation with no mythologies to follow

[Post-Chorus]
We go on and we go on, go nowhere every day
We’re trying to suppress that nothing matters anyway
Ride it, ride it 'til you’re hollow
We got no mythologies to follow
We got no mythologies to follow

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me wanna spit on your honor
Go with the bus waiting around the corner
To seek the fire in my desires
If we could all just do as I do

[Chorus]
Where, where do we go?
What do, what do we know?
We’re the youth on our own
Waiting for our spot
Where, where do we go?
What do, what do we know?
Generation with no mythologies to follow

[Post-Chorus]
We go on and we go on, go nowhere every day
We’re trying to suppress that nothing matters anyway
Ride it, ride it 'til you’re hollow
We got no mythologies to follow
