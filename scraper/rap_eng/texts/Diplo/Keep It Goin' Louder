Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Oh, yeah, oh

[Verse 1: Ricky Blaze]
Me and my friends roll in like rock stars, so we buy the bar
All eyes on us, girls watching from afar
We shining through the dark
Saw this sexy little thing, she was biting her lips
Looking at me hard
So I just went over there and just whispered in her ear:
"Do you wanna start?"

[Chorus: Ricky Blaze & Nina Sky]
Girl, I wanna party with you, girl, I wanna party with you
I got the girls in the truck, 'bout 6 chicks deep
And you know we keep it rollin', that it's straight sexy
Girl, I wanna party with you, girl, I wanna party with you
I got the girls in the truck, 'bout 6 chicks deep
And you know we keep it rollin', that it's straight sexy

[Verse 2: Nina Sky]
All night (all night) can you keep up?
When we hit the dance floor you know we turn the heat up
Set the room on fire, everyone's desire, all eyes on us, DJ turn it up
I heard you play before but today we going harder
So DJ play my song and keep it going louder
I heard you play before but today we going harder
So DJ play my song and keep it going louder

[Chorus: Ricky Blaze & Nina Sky]
(Oh, oh) Girl, I wanna party with you, girl, I wanna party with you
I got the girls in the truck, 'bout 6 chicks deep
And you know we keep it rollin', that it's straight sexy
Girl, I wanna party with you, girl, I wanna party with you
I got the girls in the truck, 'bout 6 chicks deep
And you know we keep it rollin', that it's straight sexy

[Bridge: Nina Sky & Ricky Blaze]
Keep it goin' louder (yeah, yeah)
Keep it goin' louder (keep it goin' louder)
Keep it goin' louder (keep it goin' louder)
Keep it goin' louder (My name is Ricky Blaze)
The time don't matter 'cause tonight we'll gather
I got the girls in the truck, 'bout 6 chicks deep
And you know we keep it rollin', that it's straight sexy

[Chorus: Ricky Blaze & Nina Sky]
Girl, I wanna party with you, girl, I wanna party with you
I got the girls in the truck, 'bout 6 chicks deep
And you know we keep it rollin', that it's straight sexy
Girl, I wanna party, girl, I wanna party with you
I got the girls in the truck, 'bout 6 chicks deep
And you know we keep it rollin', that it's straight sexy
Girl, I wanna party with you, girl, I wanna party with you
I got the girls in the truck, 'bout 6 chicks deep
And you know we keep it rollin', that it's straight sexy

[Outro: Ricky Blaze & Nina Sky]
Girl, I wanna party with you
I got the girls in the truck, 'bout 6 chicks deep
And you know we keep it rollin', that it's straight sexy
'Cause girl, I wanna party with you, with you
