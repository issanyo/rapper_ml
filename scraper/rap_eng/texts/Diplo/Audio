[Verse 1: Sia & Labrinth]
We got a ride, we got the night
I got the bottle, you got the light
We got the stars (Stars)
We got audio (Ooh)
We're gonna fly, we're getting high
You got the moon dust, I got the sky
We got the stars (Stars)
We got audio (Stars)

[Chorus: Sia & Both]
Make the bomb, bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the bomb, bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the song so sweet
You gon' come home with me, oh
Make the bomb, bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the bomb, bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the song so sweet
You gon' come home with me, oh

[Post-Chorus: Diplo]
Ayy, ayy
Play that audio
Play that audio
That, that

[Verse 2: Labrinth & Sia]
You got the heart, we got the soul
Just when the world saying they got no hold
Here comes the love
We got audio (A-audio)
We flying high, superhero
S on my chest, with my Marilyn Monroe
Feel like a star (Star)
'Cause we got audio
(Make it go!)

[Chorus: Sia & Both]
Make the bomb, bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the bomb, bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the song so sweet
You gon' come home with me, oh
(Make it go!)
Make the bomb, bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the bomb, bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the song so sweet
You gon' come home with me, oh

[Post-Chorus: Diplo]
Ayy, ayy
Play that audio
That, that
Play that audio
That, that
Play that audio

[Outro: Sia, Labrinth & Diplo]
We can't live on without the rhythm (Hey, sing it louder)
We can't live on without the rhythm (Hey, sing it louder)
We can't live on without the rhythm (Hey, can't live without, yeah)
We can't live on without the rhythm (Yeah, sing it louder)
We can't live on without the rhythm (Play that audio)
We can't live on without the rhythm (Play that audio)
We can't live on without the rhythm (Play that, that) (Can't live without, yeah)
We can't live on without the rhythm (That, that)
We can't live on without the rhythm
We can't live on without the rhythm
