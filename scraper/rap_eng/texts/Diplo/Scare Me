[Chorus: Timberlee ]
Dear, just scare me
No matter where you're at you can't scare me
So just scare me
No matter where you're at you can't scare me
Hear my appeal
Major Lazer!

[Verse 1:Timberlee ]
If my mother ever see me she'd be dead
They know me baby with ya, off every little led
We got outer doors, sleeping after bed
My polar bear style, come edom to zed

I bet you have something to tweet, the way oh you suck
You have to send a tweet, 3 up when we bunk
A lady in the streets with the poor slide chuck
You know me love seeds, you see it

I'm about to send me clear
Make this thing sound like Osha & Nina so sweet
I can make the latter rear
Straight to it, come be where I go
Oh just ah I go

[Hook: Timberlee ]
Wo oh oh
You punch with me man, we done sittin' there
Infinite like with mind without sittin' there
And low boy make one bad without sittin' there
Woah, just sittin' there
Woah, just sittin' there

Now something here is so special
I keep think it walks on amaranth
You think the jump on dance like carnival
Yet now we walk on bite like no carnival (Major Lazer!)

So give me, give me hard
Give me, give me, sweet
Give me, give me right, enough to make it on the street
Me a bad liar but men are quiet clear
Give me, give me, give me
With the heels 'pon the feet

[Chorus: Timberlee ]
Just scare me
No matter where you're at you can't scare me
So just scare me
No matter where you're at you can't scare me

[Verse 2: Peaches]
Wrap around my salt-like and you feel my pepper spray
Hey! you can't get away (no!) you can't get away
Now we're stuck together hot metal drippin' solder
Bangin' on my ovaries and bustin' my pi√±ata

Feel you wiki leak, I can feel you wiki leak
Feel you wiki leak, I can feel you wiki leak
Feel you wiki leak, I can feel you wiki stop
Chewing on your buttock and I hack it like a murderer

Go deep! (go go go)
Go dark! (go go go)
Go creepy! (go go go)
Go hard! (go go go)
Go deep! (go go go)
Go dark! (go go go)
Go creepy!(go go go)
Ha! Hard!
Major Lazer!

Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolfman, Invisible Man, and Hercules don't scare me!

Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

[Chorus: Timberlee ]
Just scare me
No matter where you're at you can't scare me
So just scare me
No matter where you're at you can't scare me
