[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
Oh, my, my, my, what you do to me?
Like lightning when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
You put your body on top of mine
Every time that you lift me up
To the heaven and stars above

[Pre-Chorus: Tarrus Riley]
Oh, lord, have mercy, I'm begging you, please
I'm feeling drained, I need love
You charge me up like electricity
Jump-start my heart with your love

[Chorus: Tarrus Riley & Ellie Goulding]
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful

[Verse 2: Ellie Goulding]
I couldn't leave even if I wanted to
'Cause something keeps pulling me back to you
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
The stroke of your fingers, the scent of you lingers
My mind running wild, the thoughts of your smile
Oh, you gotta give me some
And you could give it all, but it's never enough, no

[Chorus: Tarrus Riley & Ellie Goulding]
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
Hold me in your arms
Burns like a fire, electricity
When you're close I feel the sparks
Takes me higher to infinity
