[Verse 1]
Snow fall
Somehow it doesn't melt boy when it hits you, why?
All this life I've been drowned by confusion

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What you wanted, slowly losing one love
You say you don't know you were gonna
Break my heart on the winter night
Is that what you wanted?
Say the words and I'll be gone now
Show you I was gonna lose you to the blue

[Chorus]
Where is the love we had, love we had
Where is the love we had
Oh what a waste of time
Why does it hurt so bad, hurt so bad
Why do you always make me cry
Oh what a waste of time

[Post-Chorus]
You said I was your beat
What the fuck
Oh what a waste of time
Now I'm just your bitch
What the fuck
Oh what a waste of time

[Verse 2]
Why this storm? How?
Walking on the glass of your broken vows
Well what I say we're astray fooled by youth, Okay

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What you wanted, slowly losing one love
I told you you were gonna take a run on a winter night
Is that really what you wanted?
Say the words, say the words
I'd told you I was gonna
Lose you to what's cruel

[Chorus]
Where is the love we had, love we had
Where is the love we had
Oh what a waste of time
Why does it hurt so bad, hurt so bad
Why do you always make me cry
Oh what a waste of time

Where is the love we had, love we had
Where is the love we had
Oh what a waste of time
Why does it hurt so bad, hurt so bad
Why do you always make me cry
Oh what a waste of time

[Post-Chorus 1]
You said I was your beat
What the fuck
Save it for the girl you like
Oh what what a waste of time
Now I'm just your bitch
What the fuck
Oh what a waste of time
