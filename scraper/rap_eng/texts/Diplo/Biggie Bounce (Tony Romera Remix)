Nigga try me wrong it's gon' be your day

Cough syrup in my cup oh it's sticky

Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Make it clap, make it clap
Make it clap, make it clap, make it clap
Look, I walked in man girl and her friend
Kissing on each other, hell yeah they going in
Before I pulled out man your bitch hoped in
'Bout to take 'em to the house 'cause the party never end uh
Then get some Ciroc and I mix it up
Stick a molly on the table then she licks it up
Throw the ones off in the air then she picks it up
I'mma party all night 'cause I'm twisted up
Bend over, bend your back, work your back
Work your back, bend over, work your back
Work your back, work your back
Bend over, work your back, work your back, work your back
Bend over, work your back, work your back
(Get rocked)

And make it clap, make it clap
Shake it harder, put your name in my raps
