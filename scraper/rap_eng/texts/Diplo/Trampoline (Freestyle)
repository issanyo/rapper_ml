On a, on a, on a, on a real though
Only couple niggas make real dough
So understand how I make niggas feel, yo
When I come through looking like a disco
Add salt to the wound, I'm an insult
Cause I ain't released one single
On my trap shit like Diplo
On my trap shit so I dip low
Big black Range, black windows
Got me a couple more gismos
Heard niggas tryna get info
Fuck them pussies like dildos, uh
More Os, more zeros
More snow than a ski slope
You know how many niggas make a killing off me
So of course I'm a brudda they'll kill for, so
I ain't worried about nuttin'
I'mma carry on stuntin'
I treat this shit like dictatorship
I lead every race that I'm runnin'
So come get me if you want it
I protect my Wallace like Gromit
Beat every girl that I wallet
I'm sick, I make all the pussies vomit so

All my bitches get dickmatised
One told me she weren't into guys
I told her I ain't into lies
Cause like a grind, I've got [?]
I told her I'd be her winter guy
She had a plain J but she superfly
Nicki's body, Jordan's face
And a tiny waist, I got hypnotised
She doesn't drive but she'll cum in a car
Undo her bra, she'll give you her heart
She came in last place to have sex with a star
I'm competing today, she can't see me tomorrow
She doesn't drive but she came in a car
Undid her bra and she gave me her heart
She came in last place to have sex with a star
I'm competing today, she can't see me tomorrow

Unless it's somewhere official
In [?]
Mad blow, nigga, reload
On Grey Geese and Cliquot
On a flight from Heathrow
[?]
Banging old school routino
With a model for Valentino, and
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
That's just how we Migos
If all of this money keeps adding up properly
I don't think I've found my equal
Just hoes in the equation
Women ask me why
They're all my exes hating
Cause I still make their legs divide
Well there is one, but there's a big but
She kinda big but she got a big butt
And I mean big butt
It's been a while since I've been in touch
I kinda heard she's a big slut
I kinda wish we could still fuck
But she told me she's in love with me
I don't know why, well, I do
Cause I'm that guy, I put my [?]
Legoman playing inside
Not on the CD, it's Radio 1
Playing "Never Can I"
Uh, so some guy I don't like
Had the mixtape, he got it on site
Gfrsh.com with no E
Make sure that you're spelling it right, yeah

[Outro x2]
Tell them niggas to bow down
Disturbing London in your town
LOL, we live out loud
Trampoline out now
