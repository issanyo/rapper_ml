[wobbles]
Kill a kangaroo and smash it up
Smash it up
This th th th th this this th th this this this th this th this this how we do

[Verse 1]
Waking up in the morning
Gotta thank god
I smash a kangaroo
Then I feel odd
Walkin' through the scrub [?]
Spot a goanna, drink drink drink some beer
In the bush
I handle my bizzle
Go home and have a kangararizzle
Where she at but she ain't
But I straight out the drizzle
Da da da da duh shizzle my nizzle
Got a nice lady
Down in Broken Hill
Just think through the pain in my bill
Kill a kill a kangaroo
And take a pill
Put put it in the fridge
Then it can chill
Kill a kill a kangaroo
And take a pill
Put it in the fridge
Then it can chill

[Hook]
Smash a kangaroo
This this th th this this how we do

[Verse 2]
Waitin in the gully
Just kicking back
Get out tommorow
When we ain't coming back
[?]
Gonna smash a kangaroo
Straight to the bone
[?]
Me and my little crew
Beats on kangaroo
Kangaroo this is how we do

[Hook]

I wake up in the morning, I jump out of bed
I saw a kangaroo and I chop off hes head
The kangaroo was wrong
He put up a fight
So I picked up his head
Imma eat him tonight
Wake up wake up in the morning, I jump out of bed
I saw a kangaroo and I chop off hes head
The kangaroo was wrong
He put up a fight
So I picked up his head
Imma eat him tonight
