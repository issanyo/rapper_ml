[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh
Easy, easy I'm just chilling out
Feeling, feeling like I wear the crown
Looking good, dressed up in my skin
And waiting for the phone to ring ring
Swimming, swimming in my waterfall
Stripping, stripping waiting for your call
I can't wait 'til you're on the line
Yeah, now it's just a matter of time

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the type of girl that pretty, make you pass out
Talking ain't the only thing I do with my mouth
Ooh, order it and eat it up like takeout
Do it right now

[Chorus]
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
You can hit me when you're hungry
When you're all alone
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
Make it rrring yah, rrring oh
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
You can hit me when you're hungry
When you're all alone
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
Make it rrring yah, rrring oh

[Verse 2]
Tell me, tell me what you're thinkin' bout
Wearing nothing, how you feeling now?
Imagining your body on me
Motorola, roll up on me
Wanted, hundred, call me any time
Say my digits on your speed-dial
I know you want my body on you (you do, you do)
Don't you know who you're talking to?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the type of girl that pretty, make you pass out
Talking ain't the only thing I do with my mouth
Ooh, order it and eat it up like takeout
Do it right now
Do it, do it, do it

[Chorus]
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
You can hit me when you're hungry
When you're all alone
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
Make it rrring yah, rrring oh
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
You can hit me when you're hungry
When you're all alone
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
Make it rrring yah, rrring oh

[Bridge]
Motorola rolla rolla
Motorola rolla rolla yah
Motorola rolla rolla
Motorola rolla rolla yah
Motorola rolla rolla
Motorola rolla rolla yah
Motorola rolla rolla
Yah yah
Do it, do it

[Chorus]
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
You can hit me when you're hungry
When you're all alone
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
Make it rrring yah, rrring oh
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
You can hit me when you're hungry
When you're all alone
Cally my celly, call my number
Call my flip phone
Make it rrring yah, rrring oh
