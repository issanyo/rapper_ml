[Chorus: Charli XCX]
What do you do when the dance goes on
What do you do when the dance goes on
What do you do when the dance goes on
And on, and on, and on, and
What do you do when the dance goes on
Run in the streets like a marathon
What do you do when the dance goes on
And on, and on, and on, and

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
I'm here in the spotlight sun here waiting for you
Popped a thousand bottles now we 'bout to go roof
Turned up to 300, boy I'm ready for you
Wanna take me down, Yeah I take you down, yeah
Yeah, baby

[Verse 2: Konshens]
I've got so much liquor inside my body
Blazing and I enjoy my party
I pour all my 'tings myself
Crazy but I don't trust nobody
Hold on 'til we rockin' still
Poppin' pills, poppin' pills
And I [?]
Wait for me, yeah, come and [?]

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
What do you do when the dance goes on
What do you do when the dance goes on
What do you do when the dance goes on
And on, and on, and on, and
What do you do when the dance goes on
Run in the streets like a marathon
What do you do when the dance goes on
And on, and on, and on, and

[Verse 3: Charli XCX]
I can't wait to feel your hands all on my body
In my devil-red dress, come and rip it off me
Turned up to 300, speedin' on the highway
Wanna take me down, Yeah I take you down, yeah
Yeah, baby

[Verse 4: Konshens]
[???]
Hold on 'til we rockin' still
Poppin' pills, droppin' pills
And I [?]
Wait for me, yeah, come and [?]

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
What do you do when the dance goes on
What do you do when the dance goes on
What do you do when the dance goes on
And on, and on, and on, and
What do you do when the dance goes on
Run in the streets like a marathon
What do you do when the dance goes on
And on, and on, and on, and
