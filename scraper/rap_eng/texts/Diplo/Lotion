CHORUS-Lather Up!
-X4-

VERSE1-This is for the people that need that lotion
Who are so dried up and cause commotion
Settle down your imbalance of corticotropin
Your whole life’s stressed out but I have the solution

They got this new product you can get it at the stores
Ascertain where I got it then go buy some that is yours
And they call it “Shut The Fuck Up” you won’t believe what it cures
Here’s my discount code lather up them ashy knees if you want war

HOOK-I’m tryna ascertain why your such a hater
Now you need that accutane to clear all them craters

CHORUS-Lather Up!
-X4-

VERSE2-If jealousy is in your eyes then you should go and moisturize
Don’t lend out your lotion to those who cannot harmonize
Witcha soul and witcha crew we don’t buy cheap shit that’s all you
Why would you treat your skin like this? Tantrums don’t give you wins like this

Wash your face with soap at sink we don’t buy lotion ‘less it’s pink
Coco butter did I stutter It is better than you think
SPF 50 sunscreen Sun kissed skin is A luxury
Stress free life is simple and clean

HOOK-I’m tryna ascertain why your such a hater
Now you need that accutane to clear all them craters

CHORUS-Lather Up!
-X4-


VERSE3-Do you need that Gold Bond? Johnson Johnson? Neutrogena? Bath and Body?
Use whatever works cause your regimen is lookin’ shoddy
See the truth like Gnostics know your history Nag Hammadi
Cause with you things get real fishy Passamaquoddy

They got this new product advertised at the movies
Ascertain where I saw it then go buy some cause it’s groovy
And they call it “Shut The Fuck Up” you won’t believe what it’s doing
Here’s my discount code lather up them ashy knees

HOOK-I’m tryna ascertain why your such a hater
Now you need that accutane to clear all them craters

CHORUS-Lather Up!
