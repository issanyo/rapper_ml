Gonna fight, gonna fight, gonna make it through the night
When the walls cave in, feel the cold inside
When tomorrow comes, you know the sun gon' shine
And it's hard but I gotta hold my head up high

Gonna fight, gonna fight, gonna make it through the night
When the walls cave in feel the cold inside
When tomorrow come you know the sun gon' shine
And it's hard but I gotta hold my head up high
Know it's hard, but I gotta hold my head up high, oh
And it's hard, but I gotta hold my head up high, oh

Gonna fight, gonna fight gonna make it through the night
When the walls cave in, feel the cold inside
When tomorrow comes, you know the sun gon' shine
It's hard but I gotta hold my head up high

Gonna fight, gonna fight, gonna make it through the night
When the wall's cave in, feel the cold inside
When tomorrow comes, you know the sun gon' shine
Know it's hard, but I gotta hold my head up high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
