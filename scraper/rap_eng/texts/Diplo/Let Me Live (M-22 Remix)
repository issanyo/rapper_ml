[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
As I walk through the world, ah
So many things I see, uh-huh
And then I say to myself "It’s never as it seems"
'Cause I am the one, I rule my world
Nobody rule my destiny
'Cause you are the one, you rule your world
No bad man own your destiny

[Chorus 1: Anne-Marie]
Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, make I live my life
Leave me alone, make I live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, make I live my life
Leave me alone, make I live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, let me-

[Post-Chorus 1 : Anne-Marie & Mr. Eazi]
Let me live - you, you, uh, you ,you, uh
You, you, uh, you ,you, uh - every day I, every day I
Live - you, you, uh, you ,you, uh
You, you, uh, you ,you, uh - every day I
Leave me alone, let me live
You, you, uh, you ,you, uh
Live - You, you, uh
Leave me alone, let me live
You, you, uh, you ,you, uh
Live - You, you, uh


[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
Are we losing control, or is it meant to be, uh-huh?
Now I’ve opened my mind, come and set me free
'Cause I am the one, I rule my world
Nobody rule my destiny
'Cause you are the one, you rule your world
No bad man own your destiny

[Chorus 1: Anne-Marie]
Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, make I live my life
Leave me alone, make I live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, make I live my life
Leave me alone, make I live it up, live it up
Yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Anne-Marie & Mr.Eazi]
Let me live - you, you, uh, you ,you, uh
You, you, uh, you ,you, uh - every day I, every day I
Live - you, you, uh, you ,you, uh
You, you, uh, you ,you, uh - every day I
Leave me alone, let me live
You, you, uh, you ,you, uh
Live - You, you, uh
Leave me alone, let me live
You, you, uh, you ,you, uh
Live - You, you, uh
Leave me alone, let me live, live, live
Leave me alone, let me live, live, live
