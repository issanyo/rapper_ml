[Intro]
Talk to me, oh yeah
Sweet talk to me, oh yeah
Sweet talk to me, yeah
Sweet talk to me, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Faded, but I still stopped
When I saw you on my way out
I roll all my sleeves up
You may be a situation

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you want my heart, it's a silly thing to start
I can tell you know what it takes to make me fall apart

[Chorus]
So here we are, it’s going down
Such a sweet talker, turning me around
You ain't gotta look like a movie star
Cause boy you sound so sweet, you can have it all
Talk about, a teachers' pet
Baby, you look cute when you make my bed
You just keep singing those lullabies
Sweet talk me all night, honey pie

[Post-Chorus]
Sweet talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
Sweet talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
Sweet talk to me, yeah
Sweet talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)

[Verse 2]
You think you a Casanova
Now put your money where your mouth is
I think I'll kick my heels off
You don't know what you started

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you want my heart, it's a silly thing to start
I can tell you know what it takes to make me fall apart

[Chorus]
So here we are, it’s going down
Such a sweet talker, turning me around
You ain't gotta look like a movie star
Cause boy you sound so sweet, you can have it all
Talk about, a teachers' pet
Baby, you look cute when you make my bed
You just keep singing those lullabies
Sweet talk me all night, honey pie

[Post-Chorus]
Sweet talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
Sweet talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
Sweet talk to me, yeah
Sweet talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)

[Bridge]
Hope you know I'm rollin' solo after tonight, oh yeah (sweet talk to me, oh yeah)
Cause I can play this game with my eyes closed
Baby, shake it off, okay (sweet talk to me, yeah)
‘Cause you can make me feel so good
I'mma make you feel, talk to me, oh yeah
Talk to me, yeah
So talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby

[Chorus]
So here we are, it’s going down
Such a sweet talker, turning me around
You ain't gotta look like a movie star
Cause boy you sound so sweet, you can have it all
Talk about, a teachers' pet
Baby, you look cute when you make my bed
You just keep singing those lullabies
Sweet talk me all night, honey pie

[Post-Chorus]
Sweet talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
Sweet talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
Sweet talk to me, yeah
Sweet talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
