[Verse 1]
I fly high take it to the sky big money guy
Never been shy always been fly
My niggas been SLY
Big dank blowin by
Big bank let's slide
Inna bong I'm so high
Issa vibe/in Hong Kong and Prague
The sativa song make a nigga head nod
Every nigga head bob
Walk into the room and every nigga dead mad
She call me the rude boy Cuz I never had a dad
This that shit that u play before it's bed time
Play it when u jottin rhymes
Play it then commit a crime
Play it till you change your mind
Fuck what they think hopefully they think you doing fine
Fuck what they sayin they lying
Knock knock guess who real hip hop
Damn I love the game so much more than knickerbock
Nigga barely in the game but my flow top notch
Now she call me top shot when she give me hot top
I make them things go POP POP

[Chorus] M.I.A
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot) And a (click, ka-ching) And take your money All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot) And a (click, ka-ching) And take your money All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot) And a (click, ka-ching) And take your money All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot) And a (click, ka-ching) And take your money

[Verse 2]
Anthem alert yeah I seen you pop that perc
Holy grail on the shirt I give em hell with the work
Castings spells with the dirt now I'm running late for church
I ask em is it worth it leaving here hopeless
Party on the top floor I can here em choking
Floor blood soaking niggas passing roaches
Niggas taking flight running plays no coaches
Niggas say they in the game the d league overloading
This that shit that you play before you hit a lick
Play before you flip a brick
Play it when you feeling rich
Even when you down play it then u know u limitless
About to take this weight to the gym yeah I'm benching shit
Killing for the dolla let em chirp let em holla
Damn I miss my Nana fuck all this 3rd world drama
Bout to pop up and I swat em
Then I hit em with that dolla
Bout to hit em I'm the dotta
Bout to pimp em sip and slaughter

[Chorus]

[Bridge] M.I.A
M.I.A  Third world democracy
Yeah, I've got more records than the K.G.B
So, uh, no funny business
Are you ready all?
Some some some I some I murder Some I
Some I let go
Some some some I some I murder
Some I some I let go

[Chorus]
