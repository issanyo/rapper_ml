Beautiful scarlet
Summer's really gonna hurt you
Beautiful scarlet...

Summer's
Summer's

Beautiful scarlet
Summer's really gonna hurt you
The birds are all singing
And no one's gonna sing for you
The time was when
Smiling faces all around

Beautiful scarlet
There's a tear in your eye
The winter went slowly
But summer's gonna pass you by
Beautiful scarlet
Summer's really gonna...

I used to be happy
Just following you around

Beautiful scarlet
There's a tear in your eye
Beautiful scarlet
There's a tear in your eye
There's a tear in your eye
