[Chorus]
All my life I've stuck to the rhythm of the drums inside my head
Longing for the sweet sound of my mama
Make them all walk this way
All my life I've stuck to the rhythm of the drums inside my head
Longing for the sweet sound of my mama
Make them all walk this way

[Bridge]
There's a light for you, burning for you
Oh, my mama said: "It is burning for you
Oh, don't let it go, oh, don't let it it go
You'll find a way, baby, make them all burn."
(You'll make them all burn)

[Verse 1]
I'm a post-teen monster, bold and blind
From the top of my head to the shaking ground
Blame the billboards cause they've let me down
I'm a symphony of the world gone wild
(What a pretty sight)
And I spit and I cry for the dirty mind
Never really got it, baby
(You'll make them all burn)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I think about it all the time
Tough luck, when, oh, will the days come around
Boy I am thinking 'bout it all the time (ooohh)
(You'll make them all burn)

[Chorus]
All my life I've stepped to the rhythm of the drums inside my head
Longing for the sweet sound of my mama
Make them all walk this way

[Bridge]
There's a light for you, burning for you
Oh, my mama said: "It is burning for you
Oh, don't let it go, oh, don't let it it go
You'll find a way, baby, make them all burn."

[Verse 2]
I’m a bug in your eardrum, that’s my luck
(That's my luck)
And I won’t, won’t stop ‘til the day I die
You’ll never get my posse and I
We’re a symphony of the world gone wild
(What a pretty sight)
And we long for the place where we can be found
Burning like a star in our minds
(You’ll make them all burn)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I think about it all the time
Tough luck, when, oh, will the days come around
Boy I am thinking 'bout it all the time (oohh)
(You'll make them all burn)

[Hook 1]
Sun rises beyond the sea
The dead will see and we might stop living

[Chorus]
All my life I've stepped to the rhythm of the drums inside my head
Longing for the sweet sound of my mama
Make them all walk this way
All my life I've stepped to the rhythm of the drums inside my head
Longing for the sweet sound of my mama
Make them all walk this way

[Bridge]
There's a light for you, burning for you
Oh, my mama said: "It is burning for you
Oh, don't let it go, oh, don't let it it go
You'll find a way, baby, make them all burn."

[Hook 2]
Sunshine is beyond the sea
You’ll find a way, baby
Make them all burn
(Yeah)
Sunshine is beyond the sea
You’ll find a way, baby
Make them all burn
(Yeah)
