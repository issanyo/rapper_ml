[Hook: Snoop Lion]
Look how hard mama work just trying to get by
And enough ghetto youth so they still want no get no bly
Just keep on the hustle ‘cause we have to stay pon the grind
Don’t give up on yo dreams ‘cause you know the sun will shine
The sun will shine

[Verse 1: Snoop Lion]
I’m tired in the morning, too late at night
See mama scraping for nickles and dimes
On the salary she’s making we can barely survive
Tell me is these something greater in this life?

[PreHook: Snoop Lion]
Wait, said mama
Patience, said mama
Breaking down is not an option
Make it happen my son

[Hook: Snoop Lion]
Look how hard mama work just trying to get by
And enough ghetto youth so they still want no get no bly
Just keep on the hustle ‘cause we have to stay pon the grind
Don’t give up on yo dreams ‘cause you know the sun will shine
The sun will shine

[Verse 2: Snoop Lion]
How much more can my mama take?
Now I’ve got to step up to the play
Can’t afford to make mistakes
Ain’t no time to waste

[PreHook: Snoop Lion]
Wait, said mama
Patience, said mama
Breaking down is not an option
Make it happen somehow

[Hook: Snoop Lion]
Look how hard mama work just trying to get by
And enough ghetto youth so they still want no get no bly
Just keep on the hustle ‘cause we have to stay pon the grind
Don’t give up on yo dreams ‘cause you know the sun will shine
The sun will shine

[Verse 3: Jahdan Blakkamoore]
The whole damn system a-make it so hard
From California straight to New York
From Chicago going straight down her yard
People everywhere, there might be work and a strife
Can’t get a visa to fly over the borderline
Everywhere I go them facing much harder times
They know the grass no greener pon the other side
But me still want see what me can't find

[Hook: Snoop Lion and Jahdan Blakkamoore]
Look how hard mama work just trying to get by
And enough ghetto youth so they still want no get no bly
Just keep on the hustle ‘cause we have to stay pon the grind
Don’t give up on yo dreams ‘cause you know the sun will shine
The sun will shine
Look how hard mama work just trying to get by
And enough ghetto youth so they still want no get no bly
Just keep on the hustle ‘cause we have to stay pon the grind
Don’t give up on yo dreams ‘cause you know the sun will shine
The sun will shine
