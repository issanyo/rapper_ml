[Intro]
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!

[Pre-Hook]
Ayo, ayo, ayo
A-a-yo, Ayo
Get it

[Hook x2]
Ayo, get me low
Ayo, get me low
Get me on my tippy toes
Ayo, get me low
A-a-yo, get me low
Get me on my tippy toes

[Verse 1]
Break those hips, ankles, wrists
Burn the place up like Waco did
Dolo-ish, solo tip, bouncing around like pogo sticks
So sick, bonus discs, getting so low you almost trip!
Can you hear me? I'm on my shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get that beat, that focus
On that move that I can do it
Now pop that body, Maserati? Leaking fluid
Move chick, too legit
Kiss it like a crucifix
Who's this? Super sick
Bouncing off the moon and shi-

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Lower than a basement
Bass, bass
Lower than a bass-bassbassbaba...
Get it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm focused, I'm shaking
I'm trying not to get too wasted
I'm posted, I'm weightless
I get lower than a basement
I'm choking, I'm brainless
Well then hop up on my spaceship
Let's go there, I'm waiting
I get lower than a basement
Yeah!

[Hook]
