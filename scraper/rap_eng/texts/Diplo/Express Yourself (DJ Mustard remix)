Get you, get you, get you, get you, get low now

Express yourself, express yourself, express yourself
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor and work it low
Express yourself, express yourself, express yourself
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor and work it low

Express yourself, express yourself, express yourself
Put your, put your back in the
Put your, put your, put your back in the in the nah
Put your, put your, put your back in the in the nah
Put your, put your, put your, put your
Put your back in the in the nah, drop the floor

Get you, get you, get you, get you, get low, now

Legs spread wide and your head down low
Take your, miss your
Rock your, rock you, rock your

Shake the.. Shake the.., shake the
The, the put your God now

Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor, and work it low
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor, and work it low
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor, and work it low
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor, and work it low

And they mad 'cause I'm hot and they wish they was
They be hatin on my name but my piece they love
They be mad 'cause I'm hot and they wish they was
They be hatin on my name but my piece they love

Spread your legs, watch your back, go up and down and make it clap
Spread your legs, watch your back, go up and down and make it clap

Spread your legs, now watch your back, go up and down and make it clap
Spread your legs, now watch your back, go up and down and make it clap
Spread your legs, now watch your back, go up and down and make it clap
Spread your legs, now watch your back, go up and down and make it clap

Ma-ma-ma-make it clap-clap
