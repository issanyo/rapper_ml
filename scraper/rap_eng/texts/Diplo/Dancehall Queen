[Verse 1]
I take the bus to town
Sitting in the back and talk to no one
I got the high heels on
I go out dancing all by my own
People are pushing by
Somebody always tries to cut in line
Soon as I get inside
I lose myself in the blinding lights

[Chorus]
Now what, your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
Now what, your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle

[Verse 2]
I got them hypnotized
I get another shout out on the mic
Keep me out all you like
I came to dance, not to socialize
Riddim goes boom boom boom
Same thing drops with the...
People all gather round
Rocking to the beat, the queen will be crowned

[Chorus]
Now what, your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
Now what, your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle

[Bridge]
I go down low like she wow
She wow, wow, wow
One my hips will slow like she wow
She wow, wow, wow
I go down low like she wow
She wow, wow, wow
One my hips will slow like she wow
She wow, wow, wow

[Chorus]
Now what, your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
Now what, your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
