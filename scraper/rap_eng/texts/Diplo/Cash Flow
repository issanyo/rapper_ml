[Verse 1]
This is my time
They never wanna see us in the high life
But we shine bright like the sunshine
Dem can't take that this is my life
But let me tell you about hypocrisy
Life without not scalp you like a sharp knife
Hunger and starvation at the same time
Sah-ah-nah-mah-one-of-dem-gwans-no-like it
WHEN WE RISE

[Chorus 1]
When we rolling in dough
Whether you do good or bad dem leave you a zero-oh-oh
When you rolling in cash
Babylon now freed dem one know oh you'll get it so fast
When you rolling in style
You been so good thom Jah I'll read the word with a smile
But one thing comes first
One thing comes first
I never forget to yell King Selassie I The First!

[Verse 2]
Turn us loose
Babylon no wanna ghetto use from here.. threw
Set us Free
Tell them property is not your destiny
So we get it how we got to get it
Do it how we got to do it
Even if we gotta chop it or screw it
To make the cash flow like fluid
Like platinum in your pocket wop wine lil stew'ed
I am a vegetarian read like a librarian
Catch me rolling wit mad Rastafarian
Side step roll when it comes down to retiring
I can stay in this land and get marry
A bottomless grave, we are no slaves
We live in the land of the free and the womb of the brave

[Chorus 2]
Rolling in dough
Far up in the Africa way up in a thee a Congo-oh-oh
We be rolling in cash
Babylon now freed dem one know oh we get it so fast
When you rolling in style
You been so good thom Jah I read the word with a smile
But one thing comes first
I can't forget to yell King selassie I The First!

[Verse 2]
This is my time
They never wanna see us in the high life
But we shine bright like the sunshine
Dem can't take that this is my life
But let me tell you about hypocrisy
Life without not scalp you like a sharp knife
Hunger and starvation at the same time
Sah-ah-nah-mah-one-of-dem-gwans-no-like it
WHEN WE RISE

[Chorus 3]
When we rolling in dough
Whether you do good or bad dem leave you a zero
When you rolling in cash
Babylon now freed dem one know oh you'll get it so fast
We be rolling in style
You feel so good thom Jah I'll read the word with a smile
But one thing comes first
One thing comes first
I can't forget to yell His Majesty I The First!
