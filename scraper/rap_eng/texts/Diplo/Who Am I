[Verse 1: Katy B]
I got this pain and I don't know what to do with it
I got this pain, but I just can't go through with it
I can't let go, so you just take the best of me
I can't let go, cause I don't know who else to be

[Chorus: Katy B]
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Tell me
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Baby
Who am I if you're not loving me?
Tell me
Cause you and me, that's my identity

[Verse 2: Craig David]
I feel so cold
Cause I know that you be lovin' somebody new, girl
Well that's the word around town
I feel so cold
And I don't even know what I'm supposed to do now
Thought you were holding me down
You don't care
Cause I see the look in your eyes, baby
Actions speakin' louder than words lately
You don't care
Something's telling me that I should still be fighting for you

[Chorus: Katy B]
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Tell me
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Baby
Who am I if you're not loving me?
Tell me
Cause you and me, that's my identity

[Verse 3: Katy B + Craig David]
Take me back
To the day your heart belonged to me
Take me back
Only your touch, boy, can set me free
There's no test
He canâ€™t love you like I do
There's no test
Cause all of me, I gave to you, you

[Chorus: Katy B & Craig David]
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Tell me
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Baby
Who am I if you're not loving me?
Tell me
Cause you and me, that's my identity

[Bridge: Katy B + Craig David]
(Lalala lalala  lalala lalaa)
I don't know who I am if I ain't in your arms, baby
(Lalala lalala  lalala lalaa)
I don't know, I don't know
(Lalala lalala  lalala lalaa)
I don't know who I am if I ain't in your arms, baby
(Lalala lalala  lalala lalaa)
I don't know, I don't know

[Chorus: Katy B & Craig David]
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Tell me
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Baby
Who am I if you're not loving me
Tell me
Cause you and me, that's my identity
