[Bridge (Sample)]
Babylon your throne tumble down and you soon gone down
Thy walls are now shaken by lightning, earthquake, and thunder
Babylon your throne tumble down and you soon gone down
The Lord ain't coming again
It's water, and brimstone, and fire

Wow!
Fire burn!
Major Lazer, high control tower!
Anything test - danger!
Lightning, thunder, brimstone and fire!
Wicked bound to retire!
Run away Babylon, run away as I would say!
Doo, baba-doo, baba-day
It's tough fi selector!
Fling it back fi goh top to the very last drop!

[Instrumental break]

Babylon your throne tumble down and you soon gone down
Thy walls are now shaken by lightning, earthquake, and thunder
Babylon your throne tumble down and you soon gone down
The Lord ain't coming again
It's water, and brimstone, and fire
