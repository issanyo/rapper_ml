Blow that smoke
Darkness bring out our emotions
Mix em up with night life potions
I loose my head for you
Countless times we catch the sunrise
Fix em scars we share with white lies
I loose my head for you

I got the keys to heaven now
Baes all around and they got my mind spinning
Suddenly doors just open wide

Blow that smoke and let me love that fire
I don't need no memories
Bed is broken now I'm floating higher
This madness so good for me

So good so good for me

Pretty pictures keep me dreaming
(I loose my head for you)
Livin big but still deceiving
(I loose my head for you)
I’m in deep and I don’t mind
I want that moment one of a kind


I got the keys to heaven now
Baes all around and they got my mind spinning
Suddenly doors just open wide

Blow that smoke and let me love that fire
I don't need no memories
Bed is broken now I'm floating higher
This madness so good for me

So good so good for me

Love that fire
Memories
Floatin higher
Good for me

Blow that smoke and let me love that fire
I don't need no memories
Bed is broken now I'm floating higher
This madness so good for me

So good so good for me
