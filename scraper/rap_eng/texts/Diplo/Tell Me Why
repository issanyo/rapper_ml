[Pre-Chorus]
You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more
You won't

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?

[Verse 1]
I've been comin' up for a while on your radar
I know I made it just by countin' up my haters
I got a speedboat, get away, like later
You better have a load of cheddar if you ain't got data
(Give me no more, you won't)
Cause you can live it up, pull it up, start reelin'
Start throwin' hands up like you're mad at the ceilin'
You can make a killin' but don't forget the feelin'
People stealin' money and down with double dealin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more
You won't

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?

[Verse 2]
You can take me, Courthouse
You can take me, Jail
You can take me anywhere
But you can't get me there
You can ask me where I'm goin' and I'll tell you, crazy
But when I get to where I'm goin', you should come with me
You've been stayin' up, pull me up, start reelin'
I'm throwin' up my hands like I'm mad at the ceilin'

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?

[Bridge]
I got roots on my head
I got food in my pot
And the old ways are dead with the new ones we got
There's water in my pot and I'm half in, half not
And the old kind is broke
With the new kind we bought
I drink alcohol, know the words to "Wonderwall"
I rewrite the code while I do my time on road
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhh

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?
Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same?
