[Verse 1]:
Uh, I got a thing for them hood niggas
Typa nigga keep the pack and the pistol
Went to college just to get that extra money
Dope dealer I ain't never eat for [?] get your money
Rob the bank with the hoof with the Nike
Love me even more cause his Momma don't like me
Keep Chief Keef chief different colours and varieties
Backseat blow [?]

(E-e-early in the morn' getting stoned)

[Chorus]:
Pretty with her eyes low
Pretty with her eyes low
P-pretty with her eyes low
[?]
Pretty with her eyes low
Pretty with her eyes low
It's the type that i'd rather stay alive fo'
Pretty with her eyes low
Pretty with her eyes low
P-pretty with her eyes low
[?]
Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait to get home
Early in the morn' getting stoned

[Verse 2]:
Bitches only mean cause they ain't met Regina George
Do it everyday with bae so he like booty to the whores
Go and tell the weed man then my weave got blue
And he can fuck twelve if he really want to
No handcuffs [?] the boys [?] hands
Only [?] he ain't my mans
More like [?] dope d more fire
Got me [?] be a man
Only fuck with plugs with the drugs for my habit
Only fuck with thug niggas with a sense of passion
Nigga gold teeth with a grill - what's your name?
[?] fuck around and have a baby
[?] miss me with the semen long distance
You the type-a nigga I got sittin' on my wishlist
Bend it over throw a couple dollars at some thick hoes
Front row spending every [?] at my live shows
Ride harder then my baby dada [?]
[?] she fucking with it
[?]
[?]

[Verse 3]:
I got a thing for them hood niggas
Type-a nigga with  the pack and the pistol
Went to college just to get that extra money
Dope dealer i ain't never eat for [?] get your money
Rep the gold chain flame, no ice
Fresh white tee, white Nikes like rice
Keep Chief Keef chief different colours and varieties
Backseat blow [?]

E-e-early in the morn' getting stoned

[Chorus]:
Pretty with her eyes low
Pretty with her eyes low
P-pretty with her eyes low
[?]
Pretty with her eyes low
Pretty with her eyes low
It's the type that i'd rather stay alive fo'
Pretty with her eyes low
Pretty with her eyes low
P-pretty with her eyes low
[?]
Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait to get home
Early in the morn' getting stoned
