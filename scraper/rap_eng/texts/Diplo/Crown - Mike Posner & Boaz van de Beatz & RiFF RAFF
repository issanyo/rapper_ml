I can’t wait to try on the crown
I know my ma is gonna be real proud
I told my crew I’m bout to shush it down
We do it big when I get back in town

Hey hey Imma be the king soon
Hey hey I can’t wait to be king

Shush it down shush it down
Shush it down shush it down
Shush it down

I can’t wait to be king

I can’t wait to try on the crown
I know my ma is gonna be real proud
I told my crew I’m bout to shush it down
We do it big when I get back in town

Hey hey Imma be the king soon
Hey hey I can’t wait to be king

Shush it down shush it down
Shush it down shush it down
Shush it down

I can’t wait to be king

Hey hey Imma be the king soon
Hey hey I can’t wait to be king
Hey hey Imma be the king soon
Hey hey I can’t wait to be king

Don’t wanna walk on
First they just hate
Don’t worry about them angry faces
They just hating
Don’t worry about them angry faces
They just hating
People go…
Don’t worry about them angry faces
They just hating
Don’t worry about them angry faces
They just hating
Don’t worry about them angry faces
They just hating
People go…to cool a nation

Hey hey Imma be the king soon
Hey hey I can’t wait to be king
