[Intro: Sandra Melody]
Yo
Big Dada
Tell them for me now!

[Verse 1: Sandra Melody]
Full time when i get in my whims
Mash up the place and me run things
Not cause of love
Cause of little bling blings
Dubs, roses and diamond rings
Quick time i look up on tour
Limousine, yeah, don't know the score?
Me like them jeans, me might buy more
Him tune gonna sell out the store

[Chorus: Sandra Melody]
Have you heard the newsflash?
This here gonna stack some cash
Gonna make it last
You better know that
Have you heard the newsflash?
This here gonna stack some cash
Gonna make it last

[Verse 2: Sandra Melody]
Bust [?] pure [?]
Big shout to new york and brooklyn

Zing-ding ding-a-ding ding ding
Who are you and know for the [?]
Zing-ding ding-a-ding ding ding
Take my time singing
Zing-ding ding-a-ding ding ding
Yo yo yo yo yo

[Verse 3: Vybz Kartel]

I think i need her ... over there

Come here please
[?]
What is your name
You look like
A denise, no?
Step in mercedes
Drop top! you like breeze?
Is your boyfriend weak in the knees?
Kartel will satify your needs
You want cars or SUVs?
Rings with so much ice it makes you sneeze
Come cherry bee-yotch
Castries
Smoke some peepee (that's trees)
Speak to the man kartel
I'll say your name
Baby!
Just turn on the tricks
Them sunbeams
Fully kitted out with rims
That's easy like means and [?]
You're beautiful like songs that sing that they sings
Me and you can do lots of things
She'll never know
It's a trick
Or this smile i show
It's a trick
I never [?] my [?]
It's a trick
That's how misled
It's a goddamn trick
She'll never know
It's a trick
Judas man for sure
It's a trick
That's how misled
It's a trick!
Aha!
Honeybunch!
Can i say that
I hope and pray one day that
Me and you cruise in the maybach
(your sedan)
Vanna white and pat sajak?
Me, your love, i'll never betray that
Or hell's fire will be my payback
Seventy years from now, i want say
Ma, me and you go way back
Let's exchange contacts
We don't have to sign
Prenuptial contracts
My love is contagious like anthrax
Give me one back
Baby!
[?] dirty facts
Seems without you
Just can't relax
Three things in my life is certain
Death, you and income tax
