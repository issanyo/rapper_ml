[Verse 1: Sia]
All I need is one
One old man is enough
Babe, you got it wrong
Please turn your fears into trust, to trust
Please turn your fears into trust, to trust

[Pre-Chorus 1: Sia & Labrinth]
Where did love go?
You put the running into run
You asking me to stay
But I never met a girl I could trust
Where did love go?
You put the running into run
You asking me to stay
But I never met a girl I could trust

[Chorus 1: Sia]
These thunderclouds, oh no
These thunderclouds, oh no, no

[Verse 2: Labrinth]
All I need is love (da-dum, dum, dum)
All I need is a word (da-dum, dum, dum)
All I need is us (da-dum, dum, dum)
You turn nouns into verbs, to verbs

[Pre-Chorus 2: Labrinth & Sia]
Where did love go?
When all is said and done?
Hey now put your hands in the air
I'ma go through your stuff
Where did love go?
You put the running into run
You asking me to stay
But I never met a man I could trust

[Chorus 2: Sia & Both]
You're sayin' those words like you hate me now (wo-oah)
Our house is burning when you're raisin' Hell (wo-oah)
Here in the ashes,â€‹ your soul cries out (a-a-ah)
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds, oh no
These thunderclouds, oh no, no
These thunderclouds, oh no
These thunderclouds, oh no, no
These thunderclouds, oh no
These thunderclouds, oh no, no
These thunderclouds, oh no
These thunderclouds, oh no, no

[Outro: Sia]
These thunderclouds
These thunderclouds
These thunderclouds
