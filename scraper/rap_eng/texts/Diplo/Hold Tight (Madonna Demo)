[Verse 1]
A million miles later
We've walked through the valleys and found a haven
We let no one dictate us
We're tainted and bruised so there's no point saving
Us together whatever the weather, yeah
You're gonna be alright tonight, tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
I know we'll find a way
We'll walk through the seas and we'll smile again
I know we'll find a way
But for tonight, hold tight
So tonight, so tonight, hold tight
So tonight, so tonight, tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
We'll live life with no limits
We'll dance in the fire and bathe in the rain
We're gonna reach the finish
Tonight will get us but we'll get further stream
Us together, stand the stormy weather
We're gonna be alright tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
Just hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
I know we'll find a way
We'll walk through the seas and we'll smile again
I know we'll find a way
But for tonight, hold tight
So tonight, so tonight, hold tight
So tonight, so tonight, tonight, tonight

[Bridge]
A million miles later
We've walked through the valleys and found a haven
We let no one dictate us
We're tainted and bruised so there's no point saving
Us together whatever the weather, yeah
You're gonna be alright tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
Just hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
I know we'll find a way
We'll walk through the seas and we'll smile again
I know we'll find a way
But for tonight, hold tight
So tonight, so tonight, hold tight
So tonight, so tonight, tonight, tonight
