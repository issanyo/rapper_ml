[Verse 1]
When everybody leaves you lonely
Times are worse than sad
And the world is falling on your head
Just remember that for all you know
Good or bad, come what may
You're gonna live tomorrow if you don't die today

[Hook]
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

[Verse 2]
Now the fear got in me
It's got in me deep
That's where it's gonna stay and never leave
Someone come lay my worry
Someone come kill my pain
Someone come and put me on my feet again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

[Verse 3]
We gotta love one another
That's what the good man say
But I got too much trouble going 'round my head
Someone come and pick up my love
Take it all away
'Cause I could break down tomorrow
If I don't die today

[Hook]
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

[Outro]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
