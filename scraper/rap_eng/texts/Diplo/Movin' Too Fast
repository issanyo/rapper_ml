We just need to slow down
We ain't gotta rush now
Just wanna live in the moments
Time isn't money, don't blow it
We just need to slow down, slow down

Movin too fast
Got us movin too fast
Live ya life good, don't just let ya time pass
Movin too fast
Got us movin too fast

44 in a 45 kinda summer
I ain't playin ball
If you ainít about the hustle
I been making plays
Ever since the first grade
Got my mind on my money
Now my money got muscles
54 in a 55 kinda feeling
Babygirl bad, super bad little villain
Soaking up the rays
Got me dreamin of the days
Where we on top
We control the speed and the mission
Gotta lean in position
Keen intuition
To be different than all these other teens tryna get it
I been chillin for a while
Low key, no flex
Gotta take care of yourself
Or that ain't success
When youíre moving too fast
Gotta slow the speed
Drop top cruising how we supposed to be
Aye - bad chick cozy up close to me
I can show you life how it's supposed to be
Let's get it

We just need to slow down
We ain't gotta rush now
Just wanna live in the moments
Time isn't money, don't blow it
We just need to slow down, slow down

Movin too fast
Got us movin too fast
Live ya life good, don't just let ya time pass
Movin too fast
Got us movin too fast

I ain't tryna let all of my lifeÖ pass
Everybody tryna get grown fast
Imma let 'em have it, sit back silly rabbit
With my day ones, goof and just laugh
Look, I refuse to be another stat
Imma stretch the game out
Flip the hourglass
'Cause fast money, click bait, tryna flex
Hard is a formula to
Find yourself irrelevant fast
Better button up the flow now - real tight
Gotta take care of ya glow up - just right
Can't be worried bout the blow up - it takes time
Get ya quarter, nickel, dimes
You'll be doin just fine
Listen to me
When you're moving too fast
Gotta slow the speed
Drop top cruising how we supposed to be
Aye - bad chick cozy up close to me
I'm tryna show you life how it's supposed to be - lets get it

We just need to slow down
We ain't gotta rush now
Just wanna live in the moments
Time isn't money, don't blow it
We just need to slow down, slow down

They just tryna ride on my wave
Cruising down the highway
Another summer day
I'll be moving slow in the fast lane
Got my seat kicked back
Baby you can do the same
(repeat)

We just need to slow down
We ain't gotta rush now
Just wanna live in the moments
Time isn't money, don't blow it
We just need to slow down, slow down
