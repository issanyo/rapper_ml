(You can let me off of the leash, I won't come near ya. I won't come near ya)
Anyone say, baby girl...
(Teach me to stand, teach me to speak. I won't come near ya, I won't come near ya)
I tell ya, what I say...

From the very first moment you walked in on me life
Everything so pretty everything so nice
Definitely know you are me number one choice
You are the girl that I want by me side cause

To get to here you come so far
Remember the first time I saw you at the dance
Asking for your number and you give me the chance
That was the starting of our romance

Love the way you smile and think
Know me like a star in the sky shining
Girl you value more than a diamond ring
The two of we together is like lightning

And such a sweet vibes when we love making
And go upon a cruise and we smooth sailing
And then me see you kissing with the next person
And then the kind of thing it is heart breaking

(You can let me off of the leash)
Baby girl, this is what I got to let you know
Love you so much still I got to let you go
(Teach me to stand, teach me to speak)
I said you teach me a very good lesson
No matter what I will never forget ya (I tell ya)

Jessie, I love you so much my dear
So many good times that we share
Now you break my heart still it must get repaired
Cause I would leave my beautiful girls out there
Time goes on and the feelings pass
Seems this relation was not meant to last
Still you will always be here in my thoughts
even though definitely we have to part
Jessica, your the type of girl that every man wants you know
Pretty like the girl them wanting at the video
Anywhere your there your always there your front row
You play with man just like domino

Wanna leave me (Jessie)
I said you wanna leave me
Ya hear that I said you wanna leave me
Jessica, me no say you no need me
I tell ya...

(You can let me off of the leash, I won't come near ya. I won't come near ya)
Let me go, I said you wanna leave me
(Teach me to stand, teach me to speak. I won't come near ya, I won't come near ya)
Jessica I said you wanna leave me, ya wanna leave me
