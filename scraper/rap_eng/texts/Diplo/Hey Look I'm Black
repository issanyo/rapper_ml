[Intro: Sean Michaels]
I don't know how you can hate from outside the food stamps line
You can't even get in
Hahaha, let's do it

[Verse 1: Sean Michaels]
Yellow ratchet chick
23, two kids
40DDs, Dereon jeans
And yeah that bitch is mixed
I don't ever tell her shit
She don’t know all the time
On the grind
Fucked her best friends
Even the ones that ain't fine
I ain’t lying
I ain’t tryna start no drama
Fucked yo mama
Yeah I took her to my bedroom and Barack’d her like Obama
Now I’m hiding like Osama
Claiming I’m the baby’s father
Ho, I gotta get these tweets off
Bitch don’t call me

[Hook: Y-Milo]
Hey look I’m black
Hey look I’m black

Hey look I’m black, oh

Dumber than a mafucka

[Verse 2: Sean Michaels]
Said you pay rent [?]
Thinking I'mma rap quick on this shit
Ha ha bitch!
Shut yo dumb ass up and jump up on this dick
Sho’nuff, I’m sick with the flow
Bruce Leroy, I got the glow
Find me a white chick that can blow
Bust a nut inside that ho, and she can go

[Verse 3: Bella Bahhs]
Ayo Kontra, let me show you how to keep trolling when you're doing your thing over there, homie
Hey hey
Baby dad doing time
Got caught by the cops
With a nine on his hip
In the welfare line
With my son on his hip and he crying
Cause I ain't got him no milk
And his diapers full of shit
Shit
Should my mom babysit tonight?
Cause I'mma get up with my clique tonight
Get my nails done
Get my hair done
When this welfare check come
Can't tell me shit tonight
I'mma go to Forever 21
Turn my swag on, turn up on these hoes
Find me a pro
Or a nigga going gold
Or a nigga with some gold
Lemme dig a hole in his pocket
Take his profits
Cause I'm a bad bitch
Yes I'm a bad bitch
B-b-b-bad bitch
B-b-b-bad bitch
That's right
Nicki Minaj is my idol
White bitches my rivals
Weave in me that's tribal
Who you 'finna try boo?
I'mma do me, you should do you
Do...you...boo
And fuck these bitch ass haters
I ain't ratchet cause I got five kids
With seven baby daddies, they don't even know they daddies
Fuck they daddies, niggas ain't shit
I'm a single parent, I raise my own kids
But I really hope my mom babysit tonight
I'mma do some hoodrat shit, tonight
