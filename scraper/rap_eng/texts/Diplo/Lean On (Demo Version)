[Verse 1]
Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk and get it right
Innocent, remember?
We should only do it if we care for each other

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But the night was warm
Bold and free like the unborn ones
Going round the wind goes
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus]
Let it be so
Blow a kiss, we’re firin' guns
All we need is someone to lean on
Let it be so
Blow a kiss, we’re firin' guns
All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on

[Bridge]
Reach the bright sun
Reach the bright sun
Reach the bright sun, boy
Reach the bright sun

[Chorus]
Let it be so
Blow a kiss, we’re firin' guns
All we need is someone to lean on
Let it be so
Blow a kiss, we’re firin' guns
All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
[?]
All we need is somebody to lean on

[Verse 2]
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk on the sidewalk and get it right?
Will you be there to remember
How we swore to stay strong and care for each other?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When the nights are long
Longing for those days that seem to be gone
Going round the wind goes
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus]
Let it be so
Blow a kiss, we’re firin' guns
All we need is someone to lean on
Let it be so
Blow a kiss, we’re firin' guns
All we need is somebody to lean on
Let it be so
Blow a kiss, we’re firin' guns
All we need is someone to lean on
Let it be so
Blow a kiss, we’re firin' guns
All we need is somebody to lean on

[Bridge]
Reach the bright sun
Reach the bright sun
Reach the bright sun, boy
Reach the bright sun
