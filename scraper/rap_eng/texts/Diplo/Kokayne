[Hook] (x2)
I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine (x3)

[Verse 1]
They call me Jonny Quest and it's a nice night
The eyes bright and they brighter than a lightning strike
The lightning coast, glide a coast, the Pacific coast
I run the keys to Jamaica, Usain Bolt
I'm Michael Bolton boasting bragging in the Aston Martin
A lot of shit up on my chest, Dolly Parton
The iPhone got Carson Daley on the karaoke
My skin tone same colour as the french toast

[Hook] (x2)
I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine (x3)

[Verse 2]
Dangleberry hop, breaking in the bird flock
Aw shit, look who it is the white Chris Rock
I then done spent a grand on a ham steak
I should charge you ten grand for a handshake
Maybe twenty K on a show and tell
Now its 3AM, Taco Bell
I'm stacking up my cheese like a taco shell
I'm sliding through your city on a turtle shell

[Hook] (x2)
I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine (x3)

[Bridge 1: LIZ] (x2)
I need it, I want it
I would do anything for it
It brings my life enjoyment
Up all night to the early morning

[Hook] (x2)
I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine (x3)

[Bridge 2: LIZ]
Up all night to the early morning (x4)

[Bridge 1: LIZ] (x2)
I need it, I want it
I would do anything for it
It brings my life enjoyment
Up all night to the early morning
