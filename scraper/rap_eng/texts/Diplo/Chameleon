Benzi! Play that shit

Alright, Diplo, Ah
Guess who's biz-ack?
Pose not Paws
Don't call me that
Let me close that one time, this is nothing and everything all at the same time
When did I become an asshole? Ah
Don't answer that, leave a dime on the fifth
I can handle that
Lower eight will do
Fuck I'll take a 5 she got big boobs, (alright)
I'm sorry if the last line was offensive
But fuck it though, I meant it

She likes gold, she likes plat
I got a couple bucks I can get that
But I like ray and I like black, I chameleon, I can match that

I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah

That's why I'm never gonna try to be an actor
DMX used to be my favorite rapper
I'm just trying to be the same as I used to
But it's hard when they all tryna use you
So let me pull the brakes, slow down
Is it cool if I come back soon, cause I'm just tryna take a little break
Didn't think so, let me think though
I don't wanna play it back like Ringo
He just hit em with the Bone Thugs mix
Mixed with the he can really kinda sing flow, oh

I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah
I, I, got a pocket full of sunshine
I, I, wanna share it with you
I, I got a pocket full of sunshine
I, I, wanna share it with you. (uh)

It's the Pose and Benzi Show
That was one take!
Do I get a prize for that or something?
Fuck man, there's no love for me
