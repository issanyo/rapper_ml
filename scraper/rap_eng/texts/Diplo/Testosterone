[Verse 1]
Come on lover, you don't wanna fight me
I want another, you'll regret not hitting me
Can you feel the chemistry?
Yeah, you and me should be doing it right now
Ha ha, you got all them pheromones
Sweat sweat, do it 'till your body's low
Can you feel the chemistry?
Yeah, you and me should be doing it right now

[Chorus]
Yeah boy, you want it? That's cool
'Cause I'm feeling you too
It's your testosterone, testosterone, testosterone
Yeah boy, you want it? That's cool
I'm feeling you too
It's your testosterone, testosterone, testosterone

[Verse 2]
I'm a sucker for an alpha with a big ----
I'm a sucker, you gon' love it, feel your stick shift
Boy, it's your chemistry, you'll be doing me
Yeah, you boring me right now
Throw me down, ride it out
Let's prime one up, so bounce, bounce
Throw me down, ride it out
Let's prime one up, so bounce, bounce

[Bridge]
My body aches, but the pattern says
Just wanna give you my milkshake
Tomorrow babe, I'll walk away
'Cause all I want's another day

[Chorus]
Yeah boy, you want it? That's cool
'Cause I'm feeling you too
It's your testosterone, testosterone, testosterone
Yeah boy, you want it? That's cool
I'm feeling you too
It's your testosterone, testosterone, testosterone
Yeah boy, you want it? That's cool
'Cause I'm feeling you too
It's your testosterone, testosterone, testosterone
Yeah boy, you want it? That's cool
I'm feeling you too
It's your testosterone, testosterone, testosterone
