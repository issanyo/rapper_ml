[Verse 1: Dot Rotten]
If your emotions are like keys on a keyboard
You'll find me pressing buttons
If what you're speaking is deep
Then I ain't impressed with nothing
If things are positive with negatives
Inspect their comings
Stand for something
So even if you fall you ain't left with nothing
If family members are violating
Address your cousins
Always protect your brothers and sisters
And forget the cufflinks
If you get into that position
You best invest in something
Start at units, selling your music
'Till you progress to hundreds
And stay away from them streets
Them police arresting youngers
Tryna lock us up like animals
'Cause they're aggressive hunters
I'm disgusted, making us puppets, calling it justice
Realizing that the system I grew up in is corrupted
Right there I had to take a break
I'll stand face to face with the man
Who rules the world to make him pay
No currency, make him lose his life, no gun on me
Power of positive spirit above and under me

[Hook: I Blame Coco]
I want to annoy
And I'm going to enjoy it
Merely cause we're bored
Merely because we're bored
'Cause all you do is hope
You're all fucking hopers
And it's the lord of the files all over again
It's the lord of the flies all over again now

[Verse 2: Dot Rotten]
I see these lost souls
Praying to a false prophet
Old traditions got these
People making slow decisions
Not a lot community
He's giving out that soulful wisdom
It's just ghetto education:
Drugs hold, to prison
Concrete jungle, cobra's hissing
They wish they could control my living
Life is free and nature has its own permission
They say that the whole thing is written
And there's no predictions
There's war, there will be lots of victims
But I hope there isn't
I had to pause again
RIP to all the true souls that are past, all of them
Sorting out my life
I'm sure you won't see me in court again
Before I wasn't even pure
At least it wasn't all pretend
You can say that I'm just doing me
You say that 'cause you want a distance, you and me
I can make the world happy
If there were just a few of me
But there's only one of me
I guess they gonna have to do it with me

[Hook]
