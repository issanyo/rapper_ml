[Intro]
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Oh oh oh oh oooh

[Chorus]
Just let it go
If you wanna go, we could make everything better oh
Just let it go
If you wanna grow, we could make everything better

[Verse 1]
First you gotta trust me, if you try to rush me
I'll go back to rush over like a wave
If you gotta fight it, always tryna ride it
Let it just wash you over like a wave
You see when I'll give the world
Diamonds and rubies and pearls
It's safe to say that I am your girl
Now get a little bit closer, say it to me
Why would you try to fight it?
Something so natural
The waves come, you gotta ride it
If you wanna stay afloat

[Chorus]
Just let it go
If you wanna go, we could make everything better oh
Just let it go
If you wanna grow, we could make everything better

[Verse 2]
Tell me that you're only mine
Promise that I'll take the time
Nobody likes a lazy lover
One step forward, two behind
Tell me, am I outta line
For letting it take me over
Oooh, baby it's outta control
Tell me, coming crashing down
Promise you won't let me drown

[Chorus]
Just let it go
If you wanna go, we could make everything better oh
Just let it go
If you wanna grow, we could make everything better

[Outro]
Oh boy really make me, find
Boy really make my, find
Boy really make me
We could make everything better
Promise you won't let me down
