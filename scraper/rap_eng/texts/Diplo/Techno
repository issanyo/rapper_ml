[Verse 2]
I got the club jumping like a thousand jumping jacks (you know)
Spending money, see me burning through these oven racks
The club is packed front to back, man, I'm loving that (you know)
And all these ladies want my babies, that's a fucking fact
See the club is in molly's world
I think your girl geeking on that white girl
See the club is in molly's world
I think your girl geeking on that white girl

[Hook]
Yeah, my trap going techno
Yeah, my trap going techno
Yeah, my trap going techno
Yeah, my trap going techno
Got the party jumping like, got the party jumping like
Got the party jumping like, got the party jumping like
Jumping like, jumping like, jumping like, jumping like
Jumping like, jumping like
Trap going techno
