Some of them men think they freak this
Like we do, but no they don't
Make your check, come at they neck
Disrespect us, no they won't

Boy, don't even try to touch this
Boy, this beat is crazy
This is how they made me
Houston, Texas, baby

This goes out to all my girls
That's in the club rocking the latest
Who will buy it for themselves
And get more money later

I think I need a barber
None of these people can fade me
I'm so good with this
I remind you I'm so hood with this

Boy, I'm just playing, come here,baby
Hope you still like me, if you pay me
My persuasion can build a nation
Endless power, our love we can devour

Santana:
You'll do anything for me

It's hot up in here, DJ
Don't be scared to run this, run this back
I'm rep'ing for the girls who taking over the world
Help me raise a glass for the college grads

Anyone rollin' will let you know
What time it is, check
You can't hold me, I work my 9 to 5
Better cut my check

This goes out to all the women getting it in
You on your grind
To all the men that respect what I do
Please accept my shine

Boy I know you love it how we're
Smart enough to make these millions
Strong enough to bear the children
Then get back to business

See, you'd better not play me, don't come here, baby
Hope you still like me, if you pay me
My persuasion can build a nation
Endless power, our love we can devour
