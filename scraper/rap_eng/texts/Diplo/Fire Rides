[Intro]
Pure, sweet, violent hearts
Believes the signs we see in the cards
Believes the signs we read in our dreams
But we seem to follow the stream
What’s it gonna be with the violence?
What’s it gonna be with the fire rides?
And what’s it gonna be like when the sound of you and I die out?

[Verse 1]
What am I to do in my room?
Oh, look at the walls turning yellow
What am I to do in the city if I can’t have it all, and I just wanna feel pity?

[Pre-Chorus]
For my own doomed soul
Doomed as the source
Where can I find peace in the city as I found in the eyes of yours?
As I found in the eyes of yours

[Chorus]
In too deep
Give up and run
No fire rides
Oh, bitch, you've got it wrong
In too deep
I have become my darkest dream, which I'm running from

[Verse 2]
What am I to do with the thunder?
Don't know who to cast it upon
I just wanna walk to the mountains
Walk to the mountains all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
For my own doomed soul
Doomed as the source
Where can I find peace in the city as I found in the eyes of yours?
As I found in the eyes of yours

[Chorus]
In too deep
Give up and run
No fire rides
Oh, bitch, you've got it wrong
In too deep
I have become my darkest dream, which I'm running from
In too deep
My pulse has stopped
No fire rides
Oh, bitch, you've got it wrong
In too deep
I have become my darkest dream, which I'm running from

[Bridge]
Oh, nothing
Oh, nothing
('Cause we seem to follow the stream)
Oh, nothing
Oh, nothing

[Outro]
What’s it gonna be with the violence?
What’s it gonna be when the fire rides in?
What’s it gonna be like when the sound of you and I die out?
