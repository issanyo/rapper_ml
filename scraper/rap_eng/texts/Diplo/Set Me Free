[Intro]
One, two, three

[Pre-Chorus]
Stone cold, when I look up to the sky, baby
I feel freedom, and it's all gold
Like a sun up in the sky
That's the feeling

[Chorus]
Slingshot, boomerang, set me free
Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three
Slingshot, boomerang, set me free
Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three

[Verse]
We're dipping in neon lights
We're living this dream tonight
We're riding this wild young life
And we don't have to try, try, try
Try, try, try

[Refrain]
Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three
Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three
Wind it up, wind it up, wind it up, wind it up
Wind it, wind it, wind it up, one, two, three

[Pre-Chorus]
Stone cold, when I look up to the sky, baby
I feel freedom, and it's all gold
Like a sun up in the sky
That's the feeling

[Chorus]
Slingshot, boomerang, set me free
Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three
Slingshot, boomerang, set me free
Wind it up, wind it up, one, two, three

[Refrain]
Wind it up, wind it up, wind it up, wind it up
Wind it up, wind it up, wind it up, wind it up
Wind it, wind it, wind it, wind it....
Wind it up, one, two, three
(One, two three)
