[Verse 1]
Now I'm comin' over, see me down at the station
By the lane with my hands in my pocket
Jinglin' a wish coin that I stole from a fountain
That was drownin' all the cares in the world
When I get older, climbin' up
On the back porch fence, just to see the dogs runnin'
With a ring and a question and my shiverin'
Voice is singin' through a crack in the window

[Chorus]
Na, na-na-na-na-na, I better go it alone
Na, na-na-na-na-na, I better go it alone
Na, na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
Down on the corner, see me standin'
On a makeshift home with a dust storm comin'
(Na, na-na-na-na-na)
In a long black shadow, pull the hammer
From a coal mine down where your daddy was workin'
Comb my hair back, strike a match
On the bathroom wall where my number is written
Drivin' on a sidewalk, lookin' back
At the sky, it's burnin' in the rear view mirror

[Chorus]
Na, na-na-na-na-na, I better go it alone
Na, na-na-na-na-na, I better go it alone-ooh-oh-ooh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
Now I'm comin' over, see me down at the station
By the lane with my hands in my pocket
Jinglin' a wish coin that I stole from a fountain
That was drownin' all the cares in the world
When I get older, climbin' up
On the back porch fence, just to see the dogs runnin'
With a ring and a question and my shiverin'
Voice is singin' through a crack in the window

[Extended Chorus]
Na, na-na-na-na-na, I better go it alone
Na, na-na-na-na-na, I better go it alone-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Na, na, na, na, na, I better go it alone
Na, na-na-na-na-na (I better go it alone)
Na, na-na-na-na-na, I better go it alone
Na, na-na-na-na-na
I better go it alone (Na, na-na-na-na-na)
Na, na-na-na-na-na (I better go it alone)

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na
