[Verse 1]
I'm not the Don Diva
I'm beyond your don skeezers
I get cake from quick GSXRs with long heaters
One seven, hot steppin' like Tekken
I'ma be a main bitch in the game like Nina
Ain't Sabrina but the teenage magic
I have your cup and the scene's so graphic
The fake ID don’t got a mistake
Miss Banks keeps these niggas caught up in a teen angst
They’ve been tryna look, tryna fuck
Since I first came through with the AAA cup
Now I got hip-ips-ips and a butt
And I'm on radar like warm weather fronts
No candy, no 'Hello's from strangers
And Marmaduke's got four in a chamber
So you better proceed with caution
Or lay six feet deep somewhere foreign

[Hook]
They only want you when you're seventeen
When you're twenty one, you're no fun
They take a polaroid and let you go
They say they'll let you know, so come on
They only want you when you're seventeen
When you're twenty one, you're no fun
They take a polaroid and let you go
They say they'll let you know, so come on

[Verse 2]
M-I-Double-S
B-A-N-K-S
I keep the whip tucked in my breast
Snuck in the club, body half dressed
Got all them niggas by the bar impressed, hm
I vaguely skim the crowd
And I peep her man looking aroused
And maybe we can just retreat to the ABT
But that’s on me if he DTE, nigga
Nigga that’s Down To Eat
'Cause I'm down to leave if you are a freak and
Parents left town for the weekend
We can do the freakin', keep sneakin'
Beep beep, and I hop in a whip
He got a two seater Beemer and a Glock and a clip
Been sittin' in his Levi, got a black four fifth
You can cock that shit and a bitch won't trip
Says I walk and talk and act like a lady
But he got me chilling at his crib like a baby
We hit the liquor, now he wanna lick her
YKK, he’s on my zipper
He wanna tickle my fancy
And just go downtown like Delancey
So spit out ya gum
Let your tongue tip in nooks and crannies
And pass the panties

[Hook]
They only want you when you're seventeen
When you're twenty one, you're no fun
They take a polaroid and let you go
They say they'll let you know, so come on
They only want you when you're seventeen
When you're twenty one, you're no fun
They take a polaroid and let you go
They say they'll let you know, so come on

[Verse 3]
And, ain't nothing finer than a minor
Keep these niggas eatin' at my diner
Turned twenty two with the MAC eyeliner
Got curfew, so you better set the timer
Now
You got a girl goin' crazy
My hormones are going insane
Please top me off like Pizza Hut, baby
We can do it in the butt maybe - not
It's like, nigga just playin'
All a bitch is really saying is
We can get a day and in
That passenger seat looks vacant
And if you wit' it, I'm yours for the takin'
So hey shawty, what it is
You settling the fizz
By just sittin' there and looking at it
Come take a sip of my Crush
Put your hand on my blush
Better keep it on the hush, uh

[Hook]
They only want you when you're seventeen
When you're twenty one, you're no fun
They take a polaroid and let you go
They say they'll let you know, so come on
They only want you when you're seventeen
When you're twenty one, you're no fun
They take a polaroid and let you go
They say they'll let you know, so come on

[Outro (Spoken)]
I'm gonna be like:
'Hey! Hey!' laughs
What the fuck you want me to say?
You wanna turn this into a Get Lite track, nigga?
