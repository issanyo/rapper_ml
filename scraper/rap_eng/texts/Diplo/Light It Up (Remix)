[Intro: Major Lazer]
Danger them is, while some call them "Major Lazer"

[Verse 1: Nyla]
Stand up like a solider, baby
Yeah, I know you're built like that
Gun it like a holster, baby
Show dem say you're wicked like that
We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in
Tonight we let it all go free

[Pre-Hook 1: Nyla]
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock, rock, rock, rock
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me

[Hook: Nyla]
Light it up!
Light it up!
Light it up!
(Light it up, light it up)

[Verse 2: Fuse ODG]
Show them you're flame to the fire
It's written like your name on a flyer
They wanna tame your desire
But you light it up, now your aims getting higher
I dey wait for messiah
But until that day I'mma rise up high
I put my light in the air
I wanna see everywhere

[Pre-Hook 2: Fuse ODG]
1 by 1, let me see you

3 by 3 for my people
I know say I'm bound to be next like my neighbour, ye
1 by 1, let me see you
2 by 2 for the sequel
3 by 3 for my people
1, 2, 3, everybody go!

[Hook: Nyla]
Light it up!
Light it up, light it up!
Light it up!

[Pre-Hook 2: Fuse ODG]
1 by 1, let me see you
2 by 2 for the sequel
3 by 3 for my people
I know say I'm bound to be next like my neighbour, ye
1 by 1, let me see you
2 by 2 for the sequel
3 by 3 for my people
Set it ablaze

[Hook: Nyla]
Light it up!

[Outro: Nyla]
Set it ablze like a candle wick
Hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter
