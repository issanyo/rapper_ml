Testing for...

What's your twenty?
Where's your brain?
Checking in to check you out
Concerned about your whereabouts
Coffee bag, you're acting strange
So tell me what is going on
So heavy I bet

I'm fine
I'm feeling positive for real, I'm all good no
I'm fine
It's gotten complicated that's for sure

But you can see it in my eyes
You can read on my lips
I'm trying to get a hold on this
And I really mean it this time
And you know it's such a trip
Don't get me started
I'm trying to get a hold on this
Trying to get a hold on this
Trying to get a hold on this
Trying to get a hold on this
Don't get me started
(and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)

Testing for...

No big deal
It'll bounce off me
In or out, moved block before
Doesn't matter anymore
Here we go again, are you insane?
We're underneath the avalanche so heavy again

But you can see it in my eyes
You can read on my lips
I'm trying to get a hold on this
And I really mean it this time
And you know it's such a trip
Don't get me started
I'm trying to get a hold on this
Trying to get a hold on this
Trying to get a hold on this
Trying to get a hold on this
Don't get me started
(and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)
