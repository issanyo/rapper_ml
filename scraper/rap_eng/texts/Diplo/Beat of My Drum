[Verse 1]
Once upon a time I press rewind
Two left feet, I had no beat
Baby in the corner learning quick
Keep up, keep up, keep up
Graduation, take a bow
See how strong you've made me now
Two-steppin' all over me, then cha cha, cha cha, I'm in

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, don't it make your heart go "wow"?
Oh, how I've turned this whole thing round

[Chorus]
L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum
L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum

[Verse 2]
Leader of the pack, get on that track
Swing your bat and don't look back
Trapped in a tango, too much to handle
Too hot, the pan goes pop
Blow your trumpet like you do
I put on my marching boots
I know we can work it out
Let's step into the groove

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, don't it make your heart go "wow"?
Oh, how I've turned this whole thing round

[Chorus]
L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum
L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum

[Bridge]
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance, dance, dance, dance to the beat
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance, dance, dance
Drum, drum, drum
Dance to the beat of my drum


[Chorus]
L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum
L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum
