Catch 'em by surprise
Lets catch 'em by surprise
Catch 'em by surprise

Let's go
Bounce to the beat people, hands up
Everybody in the place stand up
And jump it, shake it, rush the club
Til the whole entire building is ramned up
And there's nothing you can do to hold 'em off
And when the beautiful women be showing off
We're 'bout to cause a riot in this [bitch]
Till we hear the fire alarms going off

We got 'em watching
Do we really got them all in a trance?
(Aoooww)
We got 'em watching
Do we really got them all in a trance?

(C'mon !)
Everytime time I come in
And I step up in the building
And we lit the fires
So I hope you know we got our run on
Cause you gotta know that when we get this right
And whenever I'm in this spot
There ain't no question if you gotta (C'mon !)

And hurt 'em up (Give it to 'em)
Word 'em up (Let me do them)
Strike another match and let it flame
Get your dumb on!
Everybody get ready now
Everytime I do what I do
Bust' ryhmes
Make the people wanna (C'mon !)
Let's go cause you know we go'n fly (Go'n fly)
Get ruched
Everybody get, get
Now I wanna see all a my people form a line
If ya with me wanna see ya just (C'mon !)

With Diplo and Tiesto

Now get your club on
And if my people is really wit' me then (C'mon !)
