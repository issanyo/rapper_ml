[Intro]
La, la, la, la, la, la

[Chorus]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie

[Verse 1]
0-0-7 mission and it's just one day
I marked my position then I ran away
Got these boots made for walking and some pepper spray
My two guns in my pocket cause it's brick today

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I said, Hey, Mrs. Parker
Can I get your spot?
The block's too hot, no parking lot
The joker cops, they ticket, take my cash
The boys on the block got eyes for my ass

[Chorus]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie

[Verse 2]
Last stop Franklin smell it makes me sick
Got my street vision on, I don't see shit
And still I stay fresh I spend the top dollar
Cause on my block the knockoffs are fiyah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Meet me at the J where they got the Domino game locked
Boy cross the street with tight pants on
Get your hipster ass on down to the Beacon
I fly right past him, don't take my mask off

[Chorus]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie

[Bridge]
I got the talk
The beat and bass
Give me one I'll take it
Make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play
So I speed up the pace
I break it break it
You can't stop me in this race

[Chorus]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
Ey-ey-ey-ey!
You don't lie
