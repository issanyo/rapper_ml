Full time when i get in my whims
Mash up the place and me run things
Not cause of love
Cause of little bling blings
Dubs, and diamond rings
Quick time i look up on tour

Me like them jeans, me might buy more
Him tune gonna sell out the store

Have you heard the newsflash
This here gonna some cash
Gonna make it last

This here gonna some cash
Gonna make it last
