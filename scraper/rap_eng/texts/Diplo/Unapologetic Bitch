[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, feeling good that you were gone
Hurt for a while, but I'm finally moving on
Said it, did it, hit it, quit it, then you let it go
See you tryin' to call me, but I blocked you on my phone
It took a minute, but right now I'm feeling strong
It almost killed me, but I'm better off alone
Now you're saying that you're sorry, I don't wanna know
Better face the fact you had to go

[Chorus]
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

[Post-Chorus]
You know, you never really knew
How much you loved me till you lost me, did you?
You know, you never really knew
How much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

[Verse 2]
I know you'd like it if I sat at home and cried
But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why
When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
When the gun was loaded, you were never on my side
I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
Said it, get it, love it, hate it, I don't care no more
Tell me how it feels to be ignored

[Chorus]
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

[Post-Chorus]
You know, you never really knew
How much you loved me till you lost me, did you?
You know, you never really knew
How much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

[Chorus]
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

[Post-Chorus]
You know, you never really knew
How much you loved me till you lost me, did you?
You know, you never really knew
How much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an
