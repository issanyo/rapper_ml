[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feelin' low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know...

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I won't let go
I won't let go
And I hope you know...
And I hope you know...
And I hope you know...
And I hope you know...
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
