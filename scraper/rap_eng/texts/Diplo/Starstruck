[Verse 1]
Do it again
And I'll see you tomorrow
I want to get it
You've got something to borrow

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Give me, give me, right of my own
'Cause when I throw you on again
I buy it but it don't measure up
What is the missing ingredient?

[Chorus]
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away

[Verse 2]
Under the skin
It's not so easy to swallow
Don't reel me in
To find my dreams are so hollow

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What is it you got I don't get?
I watch you fumblin' again
Dreamy behind your cigarette
Through it ain't through now

[Chorus]
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away

[Bridge]
We all find new ways being so unhuman
Try and get two heads; you are unhuman
Starstruck

[Chorus]
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away
