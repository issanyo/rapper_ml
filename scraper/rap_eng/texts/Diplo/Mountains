[Verse 1: Labrinth, Sia & Both]
Heck yeah, I breathe you
Darling, I see you
I hope you see me too
I want to know you
Here ain't no rocky ground
Yeah, I put one million down
When you walk, I kiss the ground
Hey, hey, I love you

[Chorus: Labrinth & Both]
So what we gotta lose? What we gotta move?
I move mountains (Sing)
I can see it through
I can do it too
Like a prophet (Sing, sing)
So what we gotta lose? What we gotta move?
I move mountains
I'd do anything for you
Anything to move
Move mountains
Sing it!

[Post-Chorus: Sia]
Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains

[Verse 2: Labrinth & Sia]
Lord, I am so blessed
'Cause you come with interest
Fill up my pockets
I want to own you

[Chorus: Labrinth & Both]
So what we gotta lose? What we gotta move?
I move mountains (Sing)
I can see it through
I can do it too
Like a prophet (Sing, sing)
So what we gotta lose? What we gotta move?
I move mountains (Sing)
I'd do anything for you
Anything to move
Move mountains
Sing it!

[Post-Chorus: Sia]
Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains
