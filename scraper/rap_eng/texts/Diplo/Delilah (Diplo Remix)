Love u to my heart, love u to my soul(Delilah)
I thought you were for real but you playin a role(Delilah)
Lying to me, dat is all yuh do
Fancy cars and superstars
That's the things she choose
You give up on me, I give up on you
Love is just a lying game for two
She seh man a wicked but woman a Delilah(Oh oh oh)
She seh u nuh trust mi but mi nuh trust u neither(Oh oh oh)
She seh man a wicked but woman a Delilah(Oh oh oh)
She seh she nuh trust mi but mi nuh trust u neither(neither)
Cause of yuh I got a icebox
Where my heart used to be (Delilah)
Cause of yuh I got a icebox
No more yuh holding mi(iii)

Understand yourself, back up on shell
She seh gi yuh love to nobody else

Cyan keep u pull a next man girl

Nobody knows the pain I felt(the pain I felt, the pain I felt)
So burn in hell and melt(and melt)
She seh man a wicked but woman a Delilah(Oh oh oh)
She seh u nuh trust mi but mi nuh trust u neither(Nooo)
She seh man a wicked but woman a Delilah(Oh oh oh)

Cause of yuh I got a icebox
No more yuh holding mi(iii)
