[Intro]
Brrrrr...
So, yes indeed

[Verse 1]
So signed the ryhme
(?)
Eyes opened wide
And my (?) new ways to ryhme
Is you wasted waa
I'm tellin' it the way I see it
Money is time and I ain't lyin'
Imma need to get a bike, yo dis
Fuckin' perk up my shine
Look at the girls, they work out fine
Smoked crack one time
Make sure that's allowed
We'll post some cigs and drink some wine
Never wanna razz' em tell'em ya fine
I got six and under the uhhh shaa
Never got a dog wog gettin it in
That's why you gonshabonshe tellin' your friends
Could this be the end, the end of leaf and griefin'
I wish you could see them
Receiving and freebin on top runnin' this caobwa
Runinignigng comaalala, new to the me
Not G-rated to pay
Roll up the window before it rolls away
Close my suicides
I got down till the sun
Women, will still tube run
And the lady was really nice
And my money was real tight like Mackldee
Nice car you in
I could kept this goin all night, all night, all night

[Outro]
Two lies bigger
Pimp from Malaysia
Himalaya I'm a player
I'm a leader I'm a saviour
And nevergigamyamagigyah
