[Verse 1]
Let it all go
Come on and I already know
We gotta go dig up a riot
If we wanna fly free
Doggies and dolls
I wanna be facing them all
So light up a fire
We need to get in too deep

[Chorus]
Take me to the party
Kami-kamikaze
Blame it on the buzz
I am never gonna get enough
Take me to the party
Kami-kamikaze
Leave me on the bus
I am never gonna get enough

[Post-Chorus]
Kamikaze, yeah!
Kamikaze

[Verse 2]
You say what you want
Somebody to be wasting your time
Well I am your partner in crime, girl
You should fly away with me
Saturday night
Was never really meant to do right
So come on, feed the meat to the tigers
We need to get in too deep

[Chorus]
Take me to the party
Kami-kamikaze
Blame it on the buzz
I am never gonna get enough
Take me to the party
Kami-kamikaze
Leave me on the bus
I am never gonna get enough

[Post-Chorus]
Kamikaze, yeah!
Kamikaze

[Bridge]
We got one, two, three
Till the end of the world
We got one, two, three
Till the end of the world
We go on till we die, till we die
Oh, I'm never gonna learn
We got one, two, three
Till the end of the world
We got one, two, three
Till the end of the world
We go on till we die, till we die
I'm never gonna get it
No I'm never gonna get it

[Chorus]
Take me to the party
Kami-kamikaze
Blame it on the buzz
I am never gonna get enough
Take me to the party
Kami-kamikaze
Leave me on the bus
I am never gonna get enough

[Post-Chorus]
Kamikaze, yeah!
Kamikaze, yeah!

[Outro]
Take me to the party
Kami-Kamikaze
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
