(PEEK)

In your hands
I’ll turn into something better than I am
I forget just where I am
Then you’ll be there
Baby I’m the only one that gave a damn
So take my hands
I wanna run
We could run like waterfalls
Then chase the sun
We could stay up late so faded then get done
Baby you’re the only one I wanna love
So let’s run
