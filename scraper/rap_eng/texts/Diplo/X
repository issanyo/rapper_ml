[Verse 1]
If you're only as good as the company you keep
Then I'mma blame you for what they say about me
Free your mind and let your conscience be free
When I was by myself, I was fast asleep
Since you came around, I've been up for weeks
Free your mind and let your conscience be free
Yi-yi-yikes, I've been with the wrong crowd
I can make you  a believer
If I turn the nonsense down
I keep my secrets in a safehouse
Better if I don't speak
Devil's tryna tempt me
They just outline my shape out
Place me at the crime scene
I can see from this high up
You ain't got a heart girl
Privacy is for the cheater
Obviously you're deceiving

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, I know just who you are
You put me on lay away
You just love to heart shop, oh girl
I think that it's over
I think that it's over

[Chorus]
I swear to God I'm moving on
(Mm, back up)

[Post-Chorus]
I ain't going back no more
I ain't going back no more, ahh
I ain't going back no more
I ain't going back no more, ahh
(I ain't tripping of you, you, you, you)
I ain't going back no more
I ain't going back no more
(I ain't tripping of you, you, you)
I ain't going back no more
I ain't going back no more

[Bridge]
You just start a fight
I ain't fighting back, I'm cool with it
I, simply came here to party
Why, would I trip off that bullshit
When I'm on that good shit?

[Chorus]
I swear for God I'm moving on
(Mm, back up)

[Verse 2]
Substitute love for a better thing
I deal with my pain like a lonely child, yeah, yeah
I didn't build these walls for you to piss all on my castle
Go ahead, burn it down
I'mma build me another one
All these clouds

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, I know just who you are
You put me on lay away
You just love to heart shop, oh girl
I think that it's over
I think that it's over

[Chorus]
I swear to God I'm moving on
(Mm, back up)

[Post-Chorus]
I ain't going back no more
I ain't going back no more, ahh
I ain't going back no more
I ain't going back no more, ahh
(I ain't tripping of you, you, you, you)
I ain't going back no more
I ain't going back no more
(I ain't tripping of you, you, you)
I ain't going back no more
I ain't going back no more

[Bridge]
You just start a fight
I ain't fighting back, I'm cool with it
I, simply came here to party
Why, would I trip off that bullshit
When I'm on that good shit?

[Chorus]
I swear for God I'm moving on
(Mm, back up)
(Mm, back up)
