[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

[Verse 1]
Well you're a liar and your cues are all wrong
But I can't count all the ways you woo me
I watch you capture what I can't hold
Now make it make some sense to me

[Chorus]
You are, you are my
You are, you are my
You are, you are my
Superman

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey, you got to live
You got to live
You got to live

[Verse 2]
Make it fly
Bless your soul
You get by
Take me along
But all the static here it's breaking you apart
You can't help the way you, you, you. you

[Chorus]
You are, you are my
You are, you are my
You are, you are my
Superman

[Verse 3]
(Hey!) You, you, you (hey!)
You gain weight
So walk, walk, walk on now
You know you saved me
Don't, don't, don't go hand down

[Chorus]
You are, you are my
You are, you are my
You are, you are my
Superman

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey, you got to live
You got to live
You got to live

[Outro]
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
