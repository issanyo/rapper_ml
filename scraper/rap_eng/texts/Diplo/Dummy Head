[Verse 1]
Under the sun
I was born lucky
Raised by a water gun
Spot on my body
A life on rollerblades
Did you know?
That songs from the gutter will lead your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, Lord, feed my belief
Let the war in my head go
'Cause I never ever really wanna know

[Chorus]
Nothing to do
The world is boring, and I'm so lonely
Nothing to do
Dummy head, bikini daze
Life is a daydream, we're dead anyway

[Verse 2]
You're like a fire, burns in my alley
Don't know how we get there, but I wanna marry
A guy on rollerblades
Did you know?
As pure as the sky, as the lights in my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, Lord feed our beliefs
Let the pray fuck go on go
We never ever really wanna know

[Chorus]
Nothing to do
The world is boring, and I'm so lonely
Nothing to do
Dummy head, bikini daze
Life is a daydream, we're dead anyway

[Bridge]
As the sun goes down
I dream of leaving town
Maybe I will tomorrow
Oh, when the darkness arrives

[Chorus]
Nothing to do
The world is boring, and I'm so lonely
Nothing to do
The world is boring, and I'm so lonely
Nothing to do
Dummy head, bikini daze
Life is a daydream, we're dead anyway
