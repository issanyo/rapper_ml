Yeah, can she sing
What is that shit she’s singing
It went from being one one thing thing
To a Bollywood Sing-Sing
And does it sting, I run things
Time to stick the needle in
Feeling, feeling adrenaline, adrenaline
I'm ranting like Mr. Sting


I am the lady killa
For rilla the ill man thrilla
To the bon to the bon get bigger
I’m a girl who keeps getting better


You feel it in your system
Well, I did it in the bedroom
First comes working on my groove
Then I leave the room to find a groom

Universal badass
I kick so hard I get a red card
Killa on the Red Bulla
Like Ike and Tina Turner


I am the lady killa
For rilla the ill man thrilla
To the bon to the bon get bigger
I’m a girl who gets better

Rap (Bashy)
Ain’t nobody touch this dice, ain’t no shit bodies dropping like flies
Not wearing no camouflage or disguise
Murder in the day whatever, murder in the dark
This murder is a mystery, she didn’t leave a mark
Murder is a martial art when she’s got murder on her mind
Drop nine murder killing machine
She killed all competition yeah she ruined this thing
And we come through killing the scene
I’ll kill you in your sleep, gonna kill you in your dreams
She’s a killa with a cold streak
I know you won’t be leaving here in one piece
So don’t get it twisted, looks are deceiving, she’s deadly
She will have your family greiving

My crew's getting better
My crew's getting bigger
I keep getting better
I keep getting gooder
I’m the universal badass
I kick so hard I get a red card
Close but no cigar, I got my guards
An accidental hero
A tropical Indiana Jones
Raised to fight for the underdogs
My dad's a freedom fighter dog

I'm a real G fuck a trilogy
