I'm looking up North while you touching down South (mwah)
I'm saying where I want it so you takin' it out
I'm looking up North while you touching down South (mwah)
I'm saying where I want it so you takin' it out
Keep on going, going, going, going, going down South
I'm going, going, going, going, go and kiss that mouth
Keep on going, going, going, going, going down South
I'm going, going, going, going, go and kiss that mouth

[Bridge]
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...

[Verse 1]
He went down and he kissed it
This pink pussy no lipstick
More like lip gloss when it's sticky
Ain't no bitch bossin' like Iggy
I'm gettin' head with my shades on
He head over heels, he way gone
Got his face looking all painted on
When he done getting his taste on
But ain't no returning the favor
When you get done, put your name on this waiver
Makin' a statement bout how you ate this
Banana pudding and vanilla wafer
I'm giving it to you no chaser
But this pussy be wet on the rocks
Iggy do fades and braids it really don't matter
This pussy gone drip on them locks
That Hello Kitty, no pencil pouch
This pussy neat like its stenciled out
I got his tongue shining call him Mr. Clean
It's like Listerine when he rinse it out
Got these girls callin' on missions now
They say they mad cause they missin' out
But I'm verifying his face card
And he say he love it when he kiss it now

I'm looking up North while you touching down South (mwah)
I'm saying where I want it so you takin' it out
I'm looking up North while you touching down South (mwah)
I'm saying where I want it so you takin' it out
Keep on going, going, going, going, going down South
I'm going, going, going, going, go and kiss that mouth
Keep on going, going, going, going, going down South
I'm going, going, going, going, go and kiss that mouth

[Bridge]
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...

[Verse 2]
I'm jumping out the gym like a motherfucking Laker, ho
Do me one favor, don't do me no favors
And I get 380 every time he 360
Got my old dude calling, got my new dude with me
Started in the A then he licked me to the Bay
Pit stop in Texas, slow it up, drank
Asking, "Baby how it taste? I bet it taste good."
I be cooling out on Slauson, I bet it taste hood
Got me like, "Yeah, I'm Gucci, Ferragamo and Louis."
No department stores I'm in boutiques
If it ain't high class, it don't suit me
Got that bubblicious, that chewy
Make your man act like a groupie
You like fruit? Then imagine I'm smoothie
Pussy monster, give me that Tunechi
Said he wanna blow fish, I'm hootie
Follow my legs to my booty
Self sufficient I do me, broke hoes think I'm bougie
Moody? Who me?
Wild and unruly
So I drop the top on that two-seat while his tongue roll on my tootsie

I'm looking up North while you touching down South (mwah)
I'm saying where I want it so you takin' it out
I'm looking up North while you touching down South (mwah)
I'm saying where I want it so you takin' it out
Keep on going, going, going, going, going down South
I'm going, going, going, going, go and kiss that mouth
Keep on going, going, going, going, going down South
I'm going, going, going, going, go and kiss that mouth

[Bridge]
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...
