[Verse 1]
Head to toe, you CC'd, all that damn Chanel on
All that D&G, all that YSL on
All that damn flexin', on your damn exes
All them damn Os on all your damn checks
Just copped up your Nexus, sip that tea from Texas
Upgrade to that 'Rari, shawty used to push that Lexus
All damn grown up, damn you glowned up
Shine, lil' baby, bling, bling, damn you glowed up

[Chorus]
And you mine and you know it
Fine and you know it
Glow'd up, princess cuts
Shine and you know it
And you mine and you know it
Fine and you know it
They can keep their two cents
'Cause you're a dime and you know it

[Verse 2]
Head to toe in Birkin, you just found your purpose
Never had shit handed to you, you RiRi, been workin'
You pull up, they mad, you know I know why
You cut Princess Di, you the plug, fuck them guys
And you know your worth, talkin' them M's, baby
You wanna see your purse filled up with them M's, baby
You hit the strip with me, spend up them ends, baby
You wanna see your purse filled up with them M's, baby

[Chorus]
And you mine and you know it
Fine and you know it
Glow'd up, princess cuts
Shine and you know it
And you mine and you know it
Fine and you know it
They can keep their two cents
'Cause you're a dime and you know it

[Bridge]
Flick like a Bic, baby you lit
Ain't with the fake shit, you legit
Yeah, you legit
Ain't gotta take shit, you just flip
Flip through the chips
And if you want that, you just get
You know how to get it
Flick like a Bic, baby you lit
Ain't with the fake shit, you legit
Yeah, you legit
Ain't gotta take shit, you just flip
Flip through the chips
And if you want that, you just get
You know how to get it

[Chorus]
And you mine and you know it
Fine and you know it
Glow'd up, princess cuts
Shine and you know it
And you mine and you know it
Fine and you know it
They can keep their two cents
'Cause you're a dime and you know it
