[Verse 1]
He came and scooped me with that coupe
I thought I was bulletproof
Didn't know I ball so hard, but then again it's you
We in a billion dollar club
It's not a fault, it's the truth
I could be anywhere, but I just wanna be right here with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I wore my diamonds studs, hair in a bun, this one's a keeper
You wore your Lanvin jeans, and I just wanna get between 'em
Blow my mind (blow my mind)
That's what I want you to do (that's what I want you to do)

[Chorus]
One-on-one fun
One-on-one fun
One-on-one fun, I need that one-on-one fun
One-on-one fun
One-on-one fun
One-on-one fun, I need that one-on-one fun

[Verse 2]
When we're in public, that just makes me wanna be alone with you
The look you gave me let's me know you feel it too
Ain't got no problem when they stare
It makes me wanna break the rules
I'm showing out cause baby, I'm your super girl, and you're the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I wore my diamonds studs, hair in a bun, this one's a keeper
You wore your Lanvin jeans, and I just wanna get between 'em
Blow my mind (blow my mind)
That's what I want you to do (that's what I want you to do)

[Chorus]
One-on-one fun
One-on-one fun
One-on-one fun, I need that one-on-one fun
One-on-one fun
One-on-one fun
One-on-one fun, I need that one-on-one fun

[Outro]
One-on-one fun
