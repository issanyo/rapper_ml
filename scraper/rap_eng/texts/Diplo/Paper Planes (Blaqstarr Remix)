[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
I fly like paper get high like planes
If you catch me on the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here I'll make 'em all day
I'll get one done in a second of you wait
I fly like paper get high like planes if you catch me on the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here I'll make 'em all day
I'll get one done in a second of you wait
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every step I get, I'm clockin' that game
Everyone's a winner, we make 'em off fame
Bona fide hustler making my name
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every step I get, I'm clockin' that game
Everyone's a winner, we make 'em off fame
Bona fide hustler making my name

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
She fly like paper get high like planes
Tryna keep her from the US but she stronger than a gang
Cause she got a lot of fame messin' with the wrong name
I'm following the footsteps from the hood to the music game
My city on fire ain't no need to put it out
And I'm bout set it off its like I power in my mouth
And I'm bout to bring it out to the world
I want to touch the clouds, want to be your nature girl
I feel the rain and it's tellin' me to go far
I feel the pain and it's tellin' me the music hard
Should I stay, should I go I don't know I'm kind of lost
But I'm aiming for success I'm really sorry if you don't
Neva take drugs but I'm highed up
All the music from my MC in the hood growin' up
It gets hard when you're tryna blow it up
So stressful, you say fuck it, you be like "I'm givin' up"

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money

[Verse 3: Afrikan Boy]
I was at home, making my visas
Slippin' on my government, yeah you seen how we does man
I'm fresh from Lagos, fresh from Nigeria
If I look angry, it's cause someone stole my visa
If you walk into my kitchen you will see the white powder
I'll be by the cooker, whipping at you harder
Don't be alarmed I'm just cookin' pounded yam
Afrikan Boy, I never be a drug dealer
I wrap and sell pepe in the markets of Abuja
I'm a legend, something like Jay-Jay Okocha
My name is Olushola, I just got off my visa
I live everyday like it's the first of October
The greatest hustler on Earth I know is my mother
Like mother, like son, familiar like my father
Birds of the same flow share the same feather
I just want to make my dollar and my Niara

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money

[Bridge: M.I.A.]
M.I.A., third world democracy
I got more records than the KGB
So, uh, no funny business (you already are)
Some, some, some I, some I murder
Some I, some I let go
Some, some, some I, some I murder
Some I, some I let go
