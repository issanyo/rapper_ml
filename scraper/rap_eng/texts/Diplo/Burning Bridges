[Verse 1]
Love don't have to hurt
Forget, forget who you once were
No you're wrong to beat the song
With your head against the wall
You're just too proud to make the call
Please respond, you've lost it all

[Pre-Chorus]
I thank the Lord for making ripples in the sky
Can't just sit around and cry

[Chorus]
We were born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before
Born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before

Wakey Wakey clack boom!

Light up the night
With the bridges I burn

[Verse 2]
On this open road
Don't know where but we'll just go
In my old red cameo
And if I find you in the dust
I'll clean you up and call the bus
We'll be home when we want to

[Pre-Chorus]
I thank the Lord for making ripples in the sky
Won't just sit around and cry

Let's go too far drop the pedal and we fly
Oh baby, at least we try

[Chorus]
We were born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before
Born in an open war
Wakey Wakey clack boom!
Born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before

Wakey Wakey clack boom!

Light up the night
With the bridges I burn

Never gonna to learn, never gonna learn
Light up the night with the bridges I burn
Never gonna to learn, never gonna learn
Light up the night with the bridges I burn
Never gonna to learn, never gonna learn
Light up the night with the bridges I burn


[Chorus]
We were born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before
Born in an open war
Wakey Wakey clack boom!
Born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before

Wakey Wakey clack boom!

Light up the night
With the bridges I burn

Light up the night
With the bridges I burn
