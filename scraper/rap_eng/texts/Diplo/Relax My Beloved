[Verse 1]
Relax my beloved, don't worry for me
Don't shed a tear for me always be near for me
Be confident my love don't bow you head for me
Promise you'll smile for me don't ever cry for me
You know these walls they may fall down
But I'll still hold on to you
At heights higher than you'd imagine me too

[Chorus]
Then maybe again we would weep like we've done a thousand times before
Don't turn your back on me, or shout as you walk out the door

[Verse 2]
Be still my heart, I'm only a moment away
In the next room or at the break of day
And I would walk, once again to see your face again
And I'd hear every word you'd have to say

[Chorus]
Then maybe again we would weep like we've done a thousand times before
Don't turn your back on me, or shout as you walk out the door, no no no no
Then maybe again we would weep like we've done a thousand times before
Don't turn your back on me, or shout as you walk out the door, no no no no no
Ooh, then maybe again we would weep like we've done a thousand times before
Don't turn your back on me, or shout as you walk out the door
Then maybe again we would weep like we've done a thousand times before
Don't turn your back on me, or shout as you walk out the door, no no no no no no
