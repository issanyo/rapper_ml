[Verse 1: Snoop Lion]
Tonight there's gonna be a whole lotta smoke in the air
Blow it hard for the ones who ain't here
Seems like every day we putting one six feet underground
So blessed
What goes up must come down

[Hook: Miley Cyrus]
Now my buzz is gone, I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak, I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me? Yeah
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast one
So put 'em high, let's reminisce
You're gone, but you're never missed
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast one
So raise a glass to the memories
Set em' free and fill up all those ashtrays
Fill up all those ashtrays

[Verse 2: Snoop Lion]
Tomorrow when you wake up and realize life ain't fair
Throw it back and make the whole world disappear
You never miss what you had, 'til it's gone
When it's right, something always will go wrong

[Hook: Miley Cyrus]
Now my buzz is gone, I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak, I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me? Yeah
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast one
So put 'em high, let's reminisce
You're gone, but you're never missed
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast one
So raise a glass to the memories
Set em' free and fill up all those ashtrays
Fill up all those ashtrays

Now my buzz is gone, and I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me? Yeah
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast one
So put 'em high, and reminisce
You're gone, but you're never missed
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast one
So raise a glass to the memories and set em' free
And fill up all the ashtrays
Fill up all the ashtrays
