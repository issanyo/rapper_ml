[Verse 1]
Lets go to that place we talked about
Where the sky turns into different shades of grey
And all our words fall in and out
Losing touch with the world
Clouds in my eyes and my heart are out
And the coves of the illuminations of the
Sweet sensations, need you now
Searching high and feeling low

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're going to open the door
Be prepared to let me in
I'll give you what you want and more
Take Me Slow
We both know what we are here for
We're going back around again
Around again

[Chorus]
Take Me Slow
Take Me Slow

[Verse 2]
Let's watch sky's while the lights are out
Floating in our own Galaxy
Full of noise
But we don't hear a sound
Losing track of the world

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're going to open the door
Be prepared to let me in
I'll give you what you want and more
Take Me Slow
We both know what we are here for
We're going back around again
Around again

[Chorus]
Take Me Slow
Take Me Slow

[Bridge]
And if you're going to open the door
Be prepared to let me in
I'll give you what you want and more
Take Me Slow
We both know what we are here for
We're going back around again
Around again
Around again

[Outro]
Take Me Slow
Take Me Slow
