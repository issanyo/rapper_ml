[Intro]
(Hey, yo, holla....)

[Verse 1]
Oh, what a world I was born into
Warriors are lying down
Hush, little head, you'll get sick
So sorrow-filled, I am
Old, wise river take me to the sea, breathe free
Like pilgrims on the Camino, I go, I go

[Chorus]
All the time I just want to
Let go and go and (get a hold of it)
All the time I just want to (get a hold of it)
All the time I just want to
Fuck it up and say I'll (get a hold of it)
All the time I just want to
(Hey, yo, holla....)

[Verse 2]
Oh, what a world I was born into
Babies are on the thrones
Hush, little buddy, you'll get sick
And shiver to your bones
Old, wild river take me to the sea, be free
Like pilgrims on the Camino, I go, I go
(Hey, yo, yo...holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla)

[Chorus]
All the time I just want to
Let go and go and (get a hold of it)
All the time I just want to (get a hold of it)
All the time I just want to
Fuck it up and say I'll (get a hold of it)
All the time I just want to (get a hold of it)

[Bridge]
Why do you and I live on and on?
(Get a hold of it!)
I believe it's not a question anymore
(Get a hold of it!)
Why do you and I live on and on?
(Get a hold of it!)
I believe it's not a question anymore (Holla...)

[Outro]
(Get a hold of it!)
(Get a hold of it!)
(Hey, yo)
(Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla)
