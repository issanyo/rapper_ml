[Chorus: Kiesza]
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, love to give
Love to, love to, love to, love to, love, love, love, love
You've got more love to
You've got more love to
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, love to give
Love to, love to, love to, love to, love, love, love, love
You've got more love to
I will never dream of your love till you take me there
To take me there
To take me there

[Verse: Kiesza]
You show me there's something more to us
Than the same old thing, no usual affair
I will never dream of your love till you take me there
Till you take me there, ooh babe

[Chorus: Kiesza]
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got more love to give, love to give
Love to, love to, love to, love to, love, love, love, love
To take me there
To take me there
To take me there
Take, take, take me there
To take me there
To take me there
To take me there
Take, take, take me there
Please, take me there baby
Please, take me there baby
Please, take me there baby
