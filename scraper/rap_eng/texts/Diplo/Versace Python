[Hook]
As the days keep turnin'
As the world keeps burnin'
As my soul keeps learnin'
Tears fall from the castles around my heart
As the days keep turnin'
As the world keeps burnin'
As my soul keeps learnin'
Tears fall from the castles around my heart

[Verse 1 - RiFF]
Paperboy, talk noise
Now I'm in Chinatown, bok choi
Shoulda took a pill, Clamicil
The way I ball and I coulda played for Vanderbilt
When they talkin down
They gotta speak up
When they say my name Jody
They talking bout Jody
They talking Jody Highroller
I keep the syrup in my soda

[Hook]
As the days keep turnin'
As the world keeps burnin'
As my soul keeps learnin'
Tears fall from the castles around my heart
As the days keep turnin'
As the world keeps burnin'
As my soul keeps learnin'
Tears fall from the castles around my heart

[Verse 2]
When I wake up, its a mystery
Every time I open my mouth, history
2K13 dreams in the limousine
The world burns slow, kerosene
Candle wax melts, in my fortress
I sit alone, my hearts stoned
My thoughts get assorted
I know you can't afford it
Jody, Highroller

[Hook]
As the days keep turnin'
As the world keeps burnin'
As my soul keeps learnin'
Tears fall from the castles around my heart
As the days keep turnin'
As the world keeps burnin'
As my soul keeps learnin'
Tears fall from the castles around my heart
As the days keep turnin'
As the world keeps burnin'
As my soul keeps learnin'
Tears fall from the castles around my heart
