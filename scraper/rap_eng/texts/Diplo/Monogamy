Good evening
Feeling great tonight
Aye

[Verse]
I'm pouring up these glasses posted on these late nights
Tryna travel around the world yet only get delayed flights
Record labels lending wishes like they Disneyland
Holding onto fables sh*t I guess I'm just a Disney man
Fake faces in my past and now I'm Dr Jekyll
Old shows these kids would show up
Just so they could heckle
I'd sit alone and write these raps
Thinking I'mma show em
Used to stoop to their level
Now it seems I've far outgrown em
I've got them rolling stone dreams
When I'm rolling stone
Insecure at first but now
I'm seated up on top this throne
Them same cats that used to diss
Now they wanting favors
Tell them find their knees
I got something that they can savor

And it changes just like that
See

[Hook]
My life a three way
I'm struggling with monogamy
It's money, women, rap
And I'm deep inside this policy
