[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I've been so color blind
And I've been so color blind (haha, yeah)

[Verse 1: Lil Xan]
Ayy, trips to the mall, I just stripped in the fall
I think I might really be the one after all, yeah
The one to rule them all, I'm the chosen one, the savior
But all these triple six, yeah
Make it look like I was up to no good
At least that's what my momma said, yeah
Now I'm the one givin' momma bread
Done with the pain, I'm just so heartless

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I've been so color blind
And I've been so color blind

[Drop: Lil Xan]
(I said)
(I said)

[Verse 2: Lil Xan]
Love don't cost a thing, yeah
So all my girls need diamond ring, yeah, yo, yo
Text that I sent that you never ever read
Got me feelin' like you never ever ever really cared, yeah
But that's okay though, I hope you feel okay though
They used to call me Diego, my favorite drink is Faygo

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I've been so color blind
And I've been so color blind

[Drop: Lil Xan]
(I said)

[Post-Drop: Lil Xan]
(I've been so color blind)
(I've been so color blind)
(I've been so color blind)

[Pre-Drop: Lil Xan]
(I've been so color blind)
(I've been so color blind)

[Drop: Lil Xan]
(I said)

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I've been so color blind
And I've been so color blind
