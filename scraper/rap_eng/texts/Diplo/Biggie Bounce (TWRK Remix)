You gotta face all like lisa ray
Get a clear slope on the freedom lane
Nigga try reroute, it's gonna be ok
Valet park, should have seen it at bay
Do one for magic city
Go girl, shake your ass and titty
Call what's up, oh my god, it's sticky
Everybody in the club getting tipsy
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Make it flap, make it flap, make it flap
Look, a wild thing, that girl and her friends
Kissing on each other, yeah, they going in
Before I pulled out your bitch hoped in
Gonna take her to the house 'cause the party never ends
I brought some ciroc and I mix it up
Put a molly on the table then she licks it up
Throw the ones up in the air then she picks it up
I'mma party all night 'cause I'm twisted up
Bend over, bend your back, work your back
Work your back, bend over, work your back
Work your back, work your back
Bend over, bend your back, bend your back, bend your back
Bend over, bend your back, bend your back
We go, we go, we go, we go
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Make it flap, make it flap, make it flap, make it flap
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Shorty how you at, how you stand, how you stand
And make it flap, make it flap
Shake it hard, put your name in my racks
Now I really wanna know what biggie bounce
'Cause she in the club teleporting titties out
She won't ever come out, she be in the house
Take the pussy to the bed, let the kitty out
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
Biggie bounce, biggie bounce, biggie bounce
