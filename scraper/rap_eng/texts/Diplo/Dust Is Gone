[Chorus 1]
Have you had love for me boy?
Have you only love for the blue sky?
Have you kissed the lips of the one
You liked so hard you couldn't stay alive?
I had a little dream I would have liked us to work on
Life had other plans on our romance
Damn, we could only have one dance
And we had no time

[Verse 1]
Dust is gone
We see the sun
All of us want some to hold in the winter
What went wrong
I couldn't tell if you asked me
Tik-tok-tik
Broke our hearts in two

[Verse 2]
Sand is warm
The sea lies strong
Dust is gone
As the ships we're waiting for
Only life
Keep us alive as time goes by
Salvation will come and break our hearts

[Chorus 2]
Have you had love for me, boy?
Have you only love for the blue sky?
Have you kissed the lips of the one you liked
So hard you couldn't stay alive?
I had a little dream, I would've liked us to work on
Guide you in the darkness, our romance
Damn, we could only have one dance
And we had no time

[Bridge]
All the time, all the way
What we say everyday
Life is cruel and too short
Bittersweet is our reward
All the time all the way
What we say everyday
No time to breathe and stay
So it's time to throw it away
But I'm still on the sand

[Chorus 1]
Have you had love for me, boy?
Have you only love for the blue sky?
Have you kissed the lips of the one you liked
So hard you couldn't stay alive?
I had a little dream, I would've liked us to work on
Life had other plans on our romance
Damn, we could only have one dance
And we had no time

[Outro]
Have you had love for me?
Have you only got love for the wide sky?
