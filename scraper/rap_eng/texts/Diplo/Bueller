[Verse 1]
What, you want fuck
Dance around like you lost
What they give you
You know how much that cost
Mystical
Unpredictable
Gettin licked run two to the floor
Coming out of that parking lot
Like you know it ain't my fault
Im patient rhyming
Take your time
Like every line is cherry pie
And im flying electric topic
Sixtey five, yes whose alive
They shakin like they trainin right
Then lazer ice, no ass shots
She just ain't been eatin right
Step up rollie, step up homie
Let me see what this about
Stretch it out, rule freak
Nig up take or bounce
Down south, big ballin
Hottest hills still cold
What you know is real, unbeliveable
Got a couple mil, lets make a deal
Hold up
You know what
What
Yall talk to much
What
You know what
What
Yall talk too much
What
You, you, you, you know what
Hold up
You know what
Yall talk too much
Shit smackin shit
Hold up
You know what
Yall talk too much
