[Bridge]
I need it, I want it, I need it, I want it...
I need it, I want it, tonight
I want it, I need it, this current between us
This flow, this feeling tonight
I want it, I need it, this current between us
This flow, this feeling tonight
I want it, I need it, this current between us
This flow, this feeling tonight
I want it, I need it, this current between us
This flow, this feeling tonight
I want it, I need it, this current between us
This flow, this feeling tonight
I want it, I need it, this current between us
This flow, this feeling tonight
I want it, I need it, this current between us
This flow, this feeling tonight
I want it, I need it, this current between us
This flow, this feeling tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
