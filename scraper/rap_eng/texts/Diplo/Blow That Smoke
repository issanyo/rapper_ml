[Verse 1: Tove Lo]
Darkness bring out our emotions
Mix 'em up with night life potions (I lose my head for you)
Countless times we catch the sunrise
Fix 'em, scars we share with white lies (I lose my head for you)

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
I got the keys to Heaven now
Baes all around and they got my mind spinning
I got the keys to Heaven now
Baes all around and they got my mind spinning
I got the keys to Heaven now
Baes all around and they got my mind spinning
Suddenly doors just open wide
Doors open wide

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
Blow that smoke and let me love that fire
I don't need no memories
Bed is broken now I'm floating higher
This madness so good for me
Blow that smoke and let me love that fire
I don't need no memories
Bed is broken now I'm floating higher
This madness so good for me, oh

[Post-Chorus: Tove Lo]
So good, so good for me
So good for me (Lala)
So good, so good for me

[Verse 2: Tove Lo]
Pretty pictures keep me dreaming
Living big but still deceiving (I lose my head for you)
I'm in deep but I don't mind
I want that moment, one of a kind

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
I got the keys to Heaven now
Baes all around and they got my mind spinning
I got the keys to Heaven now
Baes all around and they got my mind spinning
I got the keys to Heaven now
Baes all around and they got my mind spinning
Suddenly doors just open wide
Doors open wide

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
Blow that smoke and let me love that fire
I don't need no memories
Bed is broken now I'm floating higher
This madness so good for me
Blow that smoke and let me love that fire
I don't need no memories
Bed is broken now I'm floating higher
This madness so good for me, oh

[Post-Chorus: Tove Lo]
You're so good for me
So good, so good for me
So good for me, so good for me
So good, so good for me

[Bridge: Tove Lo]
Love that fire
Memories
Floating higher
Good for me (So good for me)
Love that fire
Memories
Floating higher
You're so good for me

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
Blow that smoke and let me love that fire
I don't need no memories
Bed is broken now I'm floating higher
This madness so good for me
Blow that smoke and let me love that fire
I don't need no memories
Bed is broken now I'm floating higher
This madness so good for me, oh

[Post-Chorus: Tove Lo]
You're so good for me
So good, so good for me
So good for me
So good, so good for me
