[Verse 1]
Oh, throw your heart to me
Let it fall and hit the ground
Let it go
Your timing was so wrong
I don't wanna be found

[Pre-Chorus]
And no, and I-I
I got the lines, I got the lines
Uh-oh, it is brighter this time
This type of mine
In this disguise
Oh you talk
Ooh to me

[Chorus]
No nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them, I can see through them
Ooh, I am drawing pictures and evading
I will not use them, I will not use them
Ugh, again!! (?)

[Verse 2]
It stars again
You came over with your friends
And I don't wanna talk with them
All I really want is to start again

[Pre-Chorus]
And no, and I-I
I got the line, I got the lines
Uh-oh, it is brighter this time
This type of mine
In this disguise
Oh you talk
Ooh to me

[Chorus]
Cause nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them, I can see through them
Ooh, I am drawing pictures and evading
I will not use them, I will not use them
Ugh, again!! (?)

[Bridge]
Cause, I wanna be (I wanna be)
Bigger than life
Hurt you-ooh
Hurt you-ooh

Yeah I wanna be (wanna be)
Bigger than life (life)
Hurt you-ooh
Hurt you-ooh

[Verse 3]
Well, nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them, I can see through them
Ooh, I am drawing pictures and evading
I will not use them, I will not use them
Ugh, again!! (?)

[Chorus]
Ooh, nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them, I can see through them
Ooh, I am drawing pictures and evading
I will not use them, I will not use them
Uggh, again!! (?)

[Outro]
I wanna be (be)
Bigger than life
Hurt you-ooh
Hurt you-ooh

I wanna be (wanna be)
Bigger than life
Hurt you-ooh
Hurt you-ooh
