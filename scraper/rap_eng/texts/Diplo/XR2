[Intro]
Where were you in 92?
Where were you in 92?
Where were you in 92?
Where were you in 92?
92? 92? 90-90-92?

[Chorus x2]
This is how we do it in the XR2
The boys look fine, stereos Alpine
20/20, Thunderbird, 12:09
Took a pill - good time, all the time

[Verse 1]
Brick Lane Massive, we were like grime
Ladbroke Grove dance, Bagley's time
High top fades, we're never paid
Rolled-up jeans, easy Lucozade
Versace jeans, shades, and chains
We roll in there like we're late!
DJ's, MC's, private raves
Keep it secret - light it, mate!

[Hook x9]
Whistle, whistle
Blow, blow!
Here we, here we go, go!

[Verse 2]
Some of them drink Heineken and some of them drink Bacardi
Some of them talk a lot of shit and act rowdy!
Some say people follow me, some say people is the key
When the music's got a beat, then that's what gets me!

[Bridge]
Some say...
Some of them...
Some say...
Some of them...
When the music's got a beat, then that's what gets me!
Some people think we are stupid, but we not!

[Hook x3]
Whistle, whistle
Blow, blow!
