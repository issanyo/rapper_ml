[Chorus: Taranchyla]
We're just here, having a good time
With this music, ghetto youts on the grind
This is our sound, our salvation
Music is me life, not just me occupation
We're just here, having a good time
With this music, ghetto youts on the grind
This is our sound, our salvation
Music is me life, not just me occupation
We're just here, having a good time
With this music, ghetto youts on the grind
This is our sound, our salvation
Music is me life, not just me occupation
