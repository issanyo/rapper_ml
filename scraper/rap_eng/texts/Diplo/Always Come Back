[Chorus]
Always bring it back to you
I get around
I get around
But you know I always bring it back to you
I get around
I get around
I get around
But I found I always come back to you
I always come back
I know where it's at
That's why I always come back

[Verse 1]
I always rewind
I don't waste your time
You start in my bed
End up on my mind
Tell me what's going on witcha
Don't need the wrong picture
Used to be blowin' that strong witcha
Goin' in strong witcha
Now I just don't get along witcha
I'm poppin' bottles and shit now
I chill with models and shit now
Used to a lot of this shit now
Been through a lot of new shit, yeah
Hard to swallow this shit, yeah
Gotta just swallow that shit, yeah
Can't bring ya pride witcha
Ya pride witcha
Put that shit aside, baby
All that shit aside, baby
I need you to ride, baby
I need you to ride, baby
Buckle up and ride for me
Doors suicide for me
I need you to ride for me
I need you to ride

[Chorus]
Always bring it back to you
I get around
I get around
But you know I always bring it back to you
I get around
I get around
I get around
But I found I always come back to you
I always come back
I know where it's at
That's why I always come back

Always reminisce
You know what I miss
You tell me, "Let's dip"
End up in my six
Tell me who pushin' you now, love
Are you gettin' around, love?
Tell me, have you even found love?
I hope you ain't found love
'Cause now ain't the time and you know
Baby you know it, it's showin'
And baby, you fine and you know
Baby, you know it, it's showin'
Post on the 'Gram and you flexin'
I just wanna know who you textin'
You tryna teach me a lesson
Baby, I get it, I get it

Always bring it back to you
I get around
I get around
But you know I always bring it back to you
I get around
I get around
I get around
But I found I always come back to you
I always come back
I know where it's at
That's why I always come back
