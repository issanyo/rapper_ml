[Verse 1]
Girl, I've been fooled by your smile
I was mistaken by the way you love me
We let it stray for a while, yeah
Looks so deceiving, you convinced me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So clear to me now
Can't explain what you're doing to me, yeah, aye
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time, but I'll figure it out
Why should we fight the feeling?
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

[Chorus]
Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With the thought of you, with the thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
Not the things you do, but the thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Love with the thought of you

[Verse 2]
I fell victim to your style
It's so amazing, girl, you're in your own league
Rather be stuck in denial, yeah
Then tryna be without you girl, girl, girl, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
So clear to me now
Can't explain what you're doing to me, yeah, aye
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time, but I'll figure it out
Why should we fight the feeling?
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

[Chorus]
Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With the thought of you, with the thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
Not the things you do, but the thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you

[Pre-Chorus]
So clear to me now
Can't explain what you're doing to me, yeah, aye
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time, but I'll figure it out
Why should we fight the feeling?
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

[Chorus]
Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With the thought of you, with the thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
Not the things you do, but the thought of you
You, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
I'm in love with the thought of you
Not the things you do, but the thought of you

[Outro]
You, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
