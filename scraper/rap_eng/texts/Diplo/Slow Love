[Bridge]
Let me love you all night long 'til the birds tweet singing along

[Verse 1]
I need to get out
Please show me your town at night
Come light this evening sky with your fireworks
Gonna have some fun and maybe
I'm gonna let you hold me for a while
You said girl you drive me crazy
Come with me to a place where the music plays

[Bridge]
Let me love you all night long to a slow beat singing our song
Let me love you all night long 'til the birds tweet singing along

[Hook]
Why is the rhythm always making me high?
It's harder to resist you, you get stuck in my mind
Why does the rhythm always make me go far?
Why should I stop when you're right here by my side?

[Verse 2]
We walk through the crowd
I could walk for hours with your hand in mine
Come light this starry night with your fireworks
Gonna dance all night and maybe
I'm gonna tell you how I've been feeling lately
Boy you make me wild and crazy
Take me home, take me home
While the time is right

[Bridge]
Let me love you all night long to a slow beat singing our song
Let me love you all night long 'til the word spreads singing along

[Hook]
Why is the rhythm always making me high?
It's harder to resist you, you get stuck in my mind
Why does the rhythm always make me go far?
Why should I stop when you're right here by my side?

Why is the rhythm always making me high?
It's harder to resist you, you get stuck in my mind
Why does the rhythm always make me go far?
Why should I stop when you're right here by my side?

[Bridge]
Let me love you all night long to a slow beat singing our song
Let me love you all night long 'til the word spreads singing our song
