Late night, wake up
I'm sick, I'm stuck
You're here, so near
Your dream my fear
Your love, my loss
Your dime my cost
My fate, your hands
My life, your brand

Living my life in spite of you
This is the best that I can do
Nothing left for me to prove
I give it all to you

Nothing's what we made it
And we're living like we hate it
I have given all I can
But I can't anymore
Freedom, I can taste it
And the truth, I need to face it
I've always been dedicated
But I can't anymore

Girl you know our love is kinda crazy
And no matter what you're still my lady
Oh
I know you're fienin up here weekly lately
Ah boy you'll find a stretch, you'll never leave me
Oh

When you woke me up and you give me the sweetest wind up
Take someone to loving, if you be young to time uh
Yea, I figured why I was so blind now
Even though your hurt was under surface and me ignored your signs girl

Limbered and teared up, can't leave me like this
Just give me a chance for me to right this
Girl I know you live my love despite this
Cannot let you go, I got to fight for this

Nothing's what we made it
And we're living like we hate it
I have given all I can
But I can't anymore
Freedom, I can taste it
And the truth, I need to face it
I've always been dedicated
But I can't anymore

It's not right 'cause you're saying this
I wasn't born to serve you
I was born to love

Your house, your rules
Keep calm, keep cool
Tip toe, steer clear
Your mask, I wear
Your wants, my needs
Loaded, good deeds
Your frown, my smile
You're up, I'm down

Living my life in spite of you
This is the best that I can do
Nothing left for me to prove
I give it all to you

Nothing's what we made it
And we're living like we hate it
I have given all I can
But I can't anymore
Freedom, I can taste it
And the truth, I need to face it
I've always been dedicated
But I can't anymore

Anymore

Baby, and you get the reason
Baby, and you get the reason
Baby, and you get the reason
Never let it sit so long mandita
