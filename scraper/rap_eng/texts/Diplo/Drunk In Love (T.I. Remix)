[Intro]
I've been drinking
Boy, I'm drinking
Turn it, turn it
Ay, turn up!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm so drunk in with love with her
Her double Ds spilling out my double cup
And she say champagne ain't strong enough
But she never real say ain't long enough
When I lift up all that Herve Leger
You see expression like it's be amazing there
Whatever you do better watch my hair
Too late, oups baby, you made it there
She try to take it there
And I swerve all over in that Rolls Royce on the way to my house
And shorty been drinking like a fish all night, wanna hit it right now
No Merlot, just camel toe, slap all on my handy ball
Ok, handcuffs, ain't no fan of those
But you ain't gonna need any hands at all
Now don't take this as misogyny when I say take this mahogany
And let me put it all in until it's hard to see
Beat it up and reverse till it's hard to breathe
Ok, you're not dealing with inexperience, promise I'm giving you pipe
Learn it, if I keep pouring up you keep throwing back
Shots will be in the air all night

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you
Drank drank drank it
Drank drank drank it
Drunk in love, we be all night
All night

[Hook]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, walking in my l'assemblage
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out like washed rags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve, surfing all of this good good

Drank drank drank it
Drank drank drank it
It's good
Surfing all of this good
Drunk in lo-oooove
Drunk in lo-oooove
All night
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 4: Jay Z]
Hold up
That D'USSÃ‰ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house tryna backup all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that 3rd, wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike Turner, turn up
Baby know I don't play, now eat the cake, Annie Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Annie Mae!"
I'm nauseous, for y'all to reach these heights you gon' need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night

We be all night, love, love
Boy I'm drinking
We be all night, love, love
Drank drank drank it

Never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking, watermelon
(I want your body right here, daddy, I want you, right now)
Boy I'm drinking
Drank it, drank it

We be all night, love, love
Boy I'm drinking
We be all night, love, love
Drank drank drank it
Boy I've been drinking
Boy, I'm drinking
