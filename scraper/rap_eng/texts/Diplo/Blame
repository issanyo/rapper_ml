[Verse 1]
It's just another Monday
Boredom make me ill
Life can't just be fun, babe
Yeah, really that's your deal
So you're staying here then
I won't be home till late
Addicted to pleasure
Gone two nights and a day

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess, I'm too hot to handle it
I'm too hot to handle
I'm too hot to handle it
Guess, I'm too hot to handle

[Chorus]
Oh, I blame it on the moonlight
Just blame it on my youth
I blame it on the star sign
That's my only truth

[Verse 2]
I can wait, but not forever
Shut up, but not for long
I could lie, but not forever
Can't close my eyes
I love until I leave it, leave it, leave it
I breathe until I burst, 'til I burst, 'til I burst
My mantra showing me facing
I walk through love, I walk through love
(oh, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess, I'm too hot to handle it
I'm too hot to handle
I'm too hot to handle it
Guess, I'm too hot to handle

[Chorus]
Oh, blame it on the moonlight
Just blame it on my youth
I blame it on the star sign
That's my only truth

[Breakdown]
That's my only truth
That's my only truth
That's my only truth
That's my only truth
(Truth...)

[Chorus]
Oh, blame it on the moonlight
Just blame it on my youth
I blame it on the star sign

[Outro]
Blame it on the moonlight, blame it on my youth
Blame it on the star sign, that's my only truth
Blame it on the moonlight, blame it on my youth
Blame it on the star sign, star sign
