[Intro: Brooke Candy]
Uh, uh...

[Verse 1: Brooke Candy]
I want, I want, I want a D boy villain, cold game killing
Ms. Candy, if you nasty, pipe game illing
Gimme poom poom feeling, honey pop, hot dreaming
Bare back on some benji
Stacked half to the ceiling like ooh
Come in here, let me put it on you
Show me what your magic stick can do
Tell me everything that you into
Cause I'ma give it to ya

[Pre-Chorus: Brooke Candy]
Boy, I think you freaky, how you want it, Mr. Dicky?
Come on lick it 'til it's squeaky, thinkin' bout it got me leaky
Got me gushy for the cookie, he don't want it from no rookie
When he get up in the nooki he like freaky freaky freaky

[Chorus: LIZ]
Even if you had no paper, sippin' on the cheap champagne
I would love every angle, if it meant you were with me
Rather be in your scraper than sittin' first class on a plane
I would love every traffic jam, if it meant you were with me

[Post-Chorus: Brooke Candy]
I need a Iggy, I need a Nicki
A bad bitch to gimme mouth to Pretty Ricky
I need a Miley, or a Britney
Or a Beyonc√© for a quicky

[Verse 2: Brooke Candy]
Okay, tongue game strong, I'll be workin'
Girl, the way I kiss the kitty, how you twerkin'
We got your man so hard that he hurtin'
He said he'd only wanna watch, but now he jerkin'
Well okay, you might know that Brookey Brooke is so cray
When they hear this shit, the fuck they gon' say?
I'm too wild for the radio to play (Bad Brooke)
But I'ma give it to 'em

[Pre-Chorus: Brooke Candy]
Boy, I think you freaky, how you want it, Mr. Dicky?
Come on lick it 'til it's squeaky, thinkin' bout it got me leaky
Got me gushy for the cookie, he don't want it from no rookie
When he get up in the nooki he like freaky freaky freaky

[Chorus: LIZ]
Even if you had no paper, sippin' on the cheap champagne
I would love every angle, if it meant you were with me
Rather be in your scraper than sittin' first class on a plane
I would love every traffic jam, if it meant you were with me

[Bridge: LIZ]
Probably 'cause your kisses worth a million bucks
Blowing all, we drinkin' out of plastic cups
Somebody crashin' at a parking motel
I don't even how you do so well
Been around that feeling sweet
It's the real deal, games I love

[Chorus: LIZ]
Even if you had no paper, sippin' on the cheap champagne
I would love every angle, if it meant you were with me
Rather be in your scraper than sittin' first class on a plane
I would love every traffic jam, if it meant you were with me
