[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1: Ms Dynamite]
9 9 9 â€˜cause I be so up
I see the waist line fit like a backsh
Like I'm not nothing to worry about
Bucket get your check before the jet stuck
Tick tick tick, no really time
Come on feel the bass drum, to make me way long
What make me bass strong
And tear the gate down, and take it straight down
Now stop, boy you feel me?

[Hook: Ms Dynamite]
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio

Everybody down and under stop!

[?]

[Verse 2: Ms Dynamite]
Can't stop til me see the sun shining
Ring the alarm and let off-a the siren
Can't stop jump with the encore whining
Up up up, no stop the man firing
Come Diplo, Diplo perfect timing
Stand stiff pose but don't stop the grinding
Watch the ride come quick, everybody dining
Now just stop

[Hook: Ms Dynamite]
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio
Sweat through your radio

(Aaaah, the radio)
(Aaaah, the radio)

Through your radio
