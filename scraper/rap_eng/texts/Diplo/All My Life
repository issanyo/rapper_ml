Major Lazer

[Verse 1]
How I me do
Pick up the package dawg
This a military ting like I come from Afghanistan
Dressed in camouflage
Before I turned 21 I was already savage dawg
I tell ya yeah, pull up in a foreign whip, foreign girl ah me passenger
Let 'em have it dawg
Call up my manager
They can pay for the damages

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope you’re listening
Inna me yard and the gyal dem ah visiting
Eh

My people work, so we get to chop
Many things they happen wey we never talk
Me I no dey talk cause you know say I be boss
I just want the weed and the girls of course

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting all my life for this type of vibe
Wanna see a million lights, light up my life
I’ve been waiting all my life for this type of vibe
Wanna see a million  lights, light up my life

[Post-Chorus]
When girls come I no wan sit down Mo ma n gbadu awon Omo, Gidi gan gan
When girls come I no wan sit down Mo ma n gbadu awon Omo, Gidi gan gan
