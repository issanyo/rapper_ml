Can you see it?
The worst is over
The monsters in my head are scared of love
Fallen people listen up!
It's never too late to change our luck

So, don't let them steal your light
E eh eh eh
Don't let them break your stride
There is light on the other side
And you'll see all the raindrops falling behind
It's a revolution
Make it out tonight
It's a revolution
It's a reva, rev
