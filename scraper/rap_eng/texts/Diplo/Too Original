[Intro]
Ass move, Kingston massive, we ready?
London massive, we ready?
Trinidad massive, we ready?
African massive, we ready, so...

[Verse 1: Elliphant]
I'mma blaze high 'til the day I die
Sweat the shit out, every tear, every lie
Hey, anybody wanna dance with me?
Sipping on my rum in the corner still, ah
So we all groove to the morning break
Now we go banana in a sugar shake
Bring the, bring the, Bring the base up, make a blasta block
Selecta gonna feed us with a well-cocked rock
See me, see me, see me, I'm a bim, see me swing
Ting tangue swinging like a tingeling
I'm a twang my body 'til the problems gone
Drop baba juice, make it goddamn strong
See me rocking out, going tribal style
Dance like a chicken, flap tiger wild
Ah, flap tiger wild

[Chorus: Jovi Rockwell]
Oh no, no no
Too original fi dem pawdie
Oh no, no no
Dem frighten all true dem saw mi
Dance like a chicken flap tiger wild

[Verse 2: Elliphant]
Come, come closer, tell a secret, boy
Dip you like a dumplin in a cup of soy
Man a crispy, don't mean to be ruff
But I really can't stay, nah, can't get enough
Puff, puff, puff, and I'm back to di heat
Loving it, living 128 beat, hey
Nah shake your meat
Enemy or friend is not an option, ah
We all the same, when we go dancing stars
Simsalabim, nah, I'm a norden gyal
Bim bim sala, kicking dreadlock style
Hunt the reflection from a disco ball
Mayham rumble 'til I drop and fall
Pump up bumble bee
Swetty honey

[Chorus: Jovi Rockwell]
Oh no, no no
Too original fi dem pawdie
Oh no, no no
Dem frighten all true dem saw mi
Dance like a chicken flap tiger wild

[Outro]
Oh no, no no
I just wanna shine
Just like the diamonds ina di sky
And I really don't care
I love to watch the smoke dance in the air
Hoist the metal[?] to yuh hands, mon, in the house right now, hands, mon
Hoist the beat[?] to everybody who has a whistle
Jovi haffi whistle, yuh hear dem whistling
Wait up buddy
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, lighter!
Dance like a chicken flap tiger wild
Only spirits with all us muhfrees[?] rockin' the house right now,
Yuh dun know?
[?] rock shit out fi you and yours
You rockin' with the best
Number one sound, gyal, sound system in di world
Major Lazer sound, it's raw
I love to watch the smoke dance in the air
