[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I'm getting kind of over this
I need a metamorphosis
Are you awake as me?
If not, do you wanna be?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Ooh, I need some temporary saving
Ooh, I need some, some uncomplicating

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Julia Michaels]
Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need something up to calm me down
Help me out, out

[Verse 2: Adam Levine & Julia Michaels]
I don't mean to bother you
But there's something that I want from you
Distract me from thinking too much
Loose ends all tied up with a touch

[Pre-Chorus: Julia Michaels & Adam Levine]
Ooh, I need some temporary saving
Ooh, I need some, some uncomplicating

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Julia Michaels]
Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need something up to calm me down
Help me out, out

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Julia Michaels]
Hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When you, you need somebody to
Yeah, hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When, when you, you need somebody to
Help you out, help me out
Help me out, help me out, out

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Julia Michaels]
Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need something up to calm me down
Help me out, out

[Outro: Adam Levine & Julia Michaels]
And hey, hey I know that there will come a day
When you, you need somebody to
Hey, hey I know that there will come a day
When, when you, you need somebody to
Help you out, help me out
Help me out, help me out, out
