[Verse 1]
Give it to me straight
When you smooth operate
Can you come out and play?
Make my tic talk
Step up to the plate
No underestimate
No never play it safe
No relax

Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t
Baby you, baby you get that take that

Tik tok round de clock
Hustlin’ on de block
Make sure everything right for my girl

The love is non-stop
You feel the impact
Collide like two stars in my world
Ready when you’re ready we can run this city
No if’s, no buts, no maybes

Seckle down gal, do the rocksteady
Me put a smile on your face like its payday

La la la la vida loca
We speeding it up like soca
Just when you think its over
We be on another level like we doing yoga

My love is toxic, stretch like elastic, drastic
Share the pilot inna mi cockpit

Gonna play it anyway

You push and shove

Gonna play it anyway

[Verse 4]
Take a ride with me
If that’s all right
We’ll shine so bright
Like the city lights
When you’re by my side
Stay by my side girl (boy)
Let’s ride if that what’s you want
Have fun if that what’s you want
We could go wherever you want girl, want girl
Bubble it if that what’s you want
Have a drink if that what’s you want
You could have anything you want girl
