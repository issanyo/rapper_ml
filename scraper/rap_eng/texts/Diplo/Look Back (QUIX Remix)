[Verse 1: DRAM]
Zoning on the road
Not knowin' where to go
But I ain't lookin' back
I ain't going back to that
Looking down on the globe
Outta this world, I know
Somehow tryna breathe
Back, baby

[Chorus: DRAM]
And I haven't looked back, uh
Since I made up my mind
To never look behind, no
And I haven't looked back, uh
For a very long time
I don't, I don't see myself looking back for you, man
Reason why is 'cause I'm only looking forward, man

[Pre-Drop: DRAM]
Man, man, man
Man, man, man, man

[Drop: DRAM]
And I haven't looked
And I haven't looked back
And I haven't looked back

[Verse 2: DRAM]
'Cause this life that's very real to me
Is relatable to you
It seemed like such a difficult task
But to me, I was just staying true
True to mine and true to yours
Tryna relieve the pain that we endured
If you don't want relief, you're still my bro
You lost but I still love you so

[Chorus: DRAM]
And I haven't looked back, uh
Since I made up my mind
To never look behind, no
And I haven't looked back, uh
For a very long time

[Pre-Drop: DRAM]
You know I haven't look back for you lately
You know I haven't look back

[Drop: DRAM]
You know I haven't look
And I haven't looked back
And I haven't looked back

[Outro: DRAM]
And I haven't looked back
