[Verse 1: Madonna]
We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping, make me wanna take my top off
Yeah, we'll be drinking and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us

[Pre-Chorus 1: Madonna]
I just wanna go up tonight
Put me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight
I just wanna have fun tonight
(Blow up this shit tonight)
Put me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight
(Gon' blow..)

[Chorus: Madonna]
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2: Madonna]
We're jumping in the pool and swimming with our clothes on
I poured a beer into my shoe and got my freak on
The neighbor's pissed and says he's gonna call the Five-O
If they show up then we are gonna give a good show

[Pre-Chorus 2: Madonna]
I just wanna go up tonight
Pull me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight
I just wanna have fun tonight
(Blow up this shit tonight)
Put me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight
(Gon' blow..)

[Chorus: Madonna]
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna
Tastes like holy water

We do it like this
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
'Cause I'm a bad bitch
We do it like this
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
'Cause I'm a bad bitch

[Bridge]
Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Who do you think you are?

[Outro]
Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star

[Laughter]
