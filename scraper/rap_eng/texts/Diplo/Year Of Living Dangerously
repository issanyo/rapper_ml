Tell me what does it mean to be faithful
Is a heart only made for beats
Just another word for painful

So I try to slow down, the brake’s broken
There’s no way to jump out of here
All these conversations unspoken

So I keep searching
For everything I’ll ever be
Never seem to learn
What I can hardly ever see

This is my life, this is my dream
This is my belief, it’s my fantasy
I still haven’t found what’s gonna set me free
This is my year of living dangerously

Now I can’t turn around
What’s done is done
There are words that you can’t take back
When you say them to someone
(What’s done is done, what’s done is done)

Now you sound like a Redwood falling
With nobody around to hear
I’m out of here you’re stalling

When I’m standing on the freeway
With my hair blowing in the wind
Maybe one day soon I’ll make it
Where I’ve never been

This is my life, this is my dream
This is my belief, it’s my fantasy
I still haven’t found what’s gonna set me free
This is my year of living dangerously
This is my time, just let me be
This is my design, it comes naturally
I still gotta find what’s gonna set me free
This is my year of living dangerously

Ain’t gonna stop for nobody, no one
Ain’t slowing down and it’s not my problem now
Ain’t nothing left you can sell me, tell me
I’ve done my best, aw feet don’t fail me now

This is my life, this is my dream
This is my belief, it’s my fantasy
I still haven’t found what’s gonna set me free
This is my year of living dangerously
This is my time, just let me be
This is my design, it comes naturally
I still gotta find what’s gonna set me free
This is my year of living dangerously
