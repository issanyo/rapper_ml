Vanishes before [x6]

I just spent three hours in the pool,
you know three hours in the pool,
you know three hours in the pool,
and I became part the water, part the air, part of all the color in the air, part of space.
You know, it was me and I was it.
It all melted in together, that’s why I stayed there so long.
I didn’t know what to do..
