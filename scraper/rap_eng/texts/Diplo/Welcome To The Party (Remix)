ESSKEETIT

[Verse 1: Lil Pump]
I can't feel my body, 'cause I pop a lot of molly (molly)
Welcome to the party, welcome to the drug party (ouu)
Got a lotta thotties, yeah, I fuck a lot of thotties (esskeetit)
Tryna fuck shorty, I'm just tryna fuck shorty (ouu)
Welcome to the trap, got my grandma selling crack (yuh)
I make what you make in one year sitting down just movin' packs (damn)
Make a bitch do jumpin' jacks (ouu), like she was a acrobat (yuh)
Got these bitches lookin' at me crazy 'cause I got face tats (ouu)
Ouu, drip, drip, drip, I cannot go wife a bitch (no!)
Drop 5 million on my crib, now Lil Pump is rich as shit, ouu
And I'm still on my probation, pop a pill, I feel amazing (brrt)
You just broke and you just hatin', all these diamonds on me skatin'
Man, I do this every day, spend three thousand on some shades
I got bitches in L.A., your boyfriend broke, his diamonds fake (yuh)

[Chorus: French Montana]
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Welcome to the party, I might tear your club up
9 times out of 10 I'm probably drugged up
Speaking on my name just to get your buzz up
They say money talk, nigga shut the fuck up (shut the fuck up)
This is Uncle Juice, pickup full of juice
Pop a pill or two, fuck some on the roof
I'm so fucking high, don't know who is who
She put it in my face, you should see my view
Racks out, threw a few
Shake some get some loose
I got good drank, Quavo, 2 Chainz
Yeah I'm sippin'
50 souls wanted to be cuffed they go to prison
Call a black card, Master P, it ain't No Limit
Welcome to my party we ain't finished 'till we finished
We ain't finished 'till we spinnin'
Call a bar tell I'm sinnin'

[Chorus: French Montana]
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party

[Verse 3: Famous Dex]
(Yessir!)
Baby girl, you can walk into the party
Sippin' on that lean, no I don't do Bacardi
Stomp a nigga and I don't say sorry
Fuck that bitch, then I kick her out the 'Rari
Yeah, baby you a thot (ouu, boy)
Cruisin' down the block with a Glock (ouu, yuh)
You a stupid ass bitch if I trust you (what?)
Baby, only tryna  fuck you (huh, ouu)
I'll fuck you in my swimming pool
Only if you cool and you bring your friends too
(Dexter!)

[Chorus: French Montana]
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party
Ayy, welcome to the party

[Outro: Juicy J]
Yeah hoe!
