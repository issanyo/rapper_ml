[Verse: Aluna]
Believe me, I could live without you
But I really don't want to
Believe me, I could love without you
But I really don't need to

[Chorus: Aluna]
’Cause leavin' is the hardest thing to do
But being left is harder, yes it's true
But try coming back
How do I get back to you, to you, to you?

[Verse: Aluna]
Believe me, I could live without you
But I really don't want to
Believe me, I could love without you
But I really don't need to

[Chorus: Aluna]
’Cause leavin' is the hardest thing to do
But being left is harder, yes it's true
But try coming back
How do I get back to you, to you, to you?
