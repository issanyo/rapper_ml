[Verse 1]
You can call me "M", tonight
You can be my man, tonight
It's gon' be like damn, that's right
Give you love that you'll never forget
The city is our playground, tonight
We gon' be like gangsters, tonight
We don't give a damn if it's wrong or right
Light it up, we won't have no regrets

[Chorus]
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
Lose your self-control, we can go wild
Show you what it means to feel alive
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
(Life, life, life)

[Verse 2]
We don't have to speak that much
I hear you and I feel your touch
Whisper in my ears, make me blush
Feel the chills when we kiss, don't forget
All your wildest dreams, don't hold back
All the fantasies you ever had
Just do what you like, go ahead
Close your eyes, make a wish, no regrets

[Chorus]
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
Lose your self-control, we can go wild
Show you what it means to feel alive
I'll make this the best night of your life
(I'll make this the best night of your life)
I'll make this the best night of your life
(Life, life, life)

[Bridge]
Surrender to the pleasure
(Wanting) when we breathe in together
(Waiting) it's either now or never
(For you) this feeling will take over
No sex tapes, no camera
(Wanting) just you and me, together
(Waiting) repeat it like a mantra
For you, I'm in love, I'm in love

[Chorus]
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
Lose your self-control, we can go wild
Show you what it means to feel alive
I'll make this the best night of your life
(I'll make this the best night of your life)
I'll make this the best night of your life
(Life, life, life)

[Outro]
(Best night, night, night, night...)
(Best night, night, night, night...)
