[Verse 1]
Seen her at a party posing for photos
She don't think about the world past painting toes
This girl has been doing rounds at the local mall
And a evading past doing dudes in rock and roll
Pretty face character deadly like a
She always claims she's part native Navajo
It's kinda easy dressin' head to toe in black
Her style is straight whack off a magazine rack
Buy it, post it, link it, spread it, ready and read it
You're always on Myspace but you need phone credit

[Hook]
You wanna be the next big thing, "it" thing
Do anything, but you can't sing
Hey Marsha
What'd you do yesterday?
'Cause when I read the blog story
Don't add up to what you told me
Hey Marsha
What'd you do yesterday
What I read on your blog story
Don't add up to what you told me

[Verse 2]
You want, you want, you want, you want
You want to be a model for American Apparel
It's apparent that yourself is way dumber than Cowell
You want high fashion so you worked at fashion high
Cocaine kept you talking most of it a fucking lie
You shooters now dumber trying to talent call job
Your shoes could feed a village
You should think about that
Facebook face facts can you know that
"Blah blah blah blah blah", girl, you should post that

[Hook]
You wanna be the next big thing, "it" thing
Do anything, but you can't sing
Hey Marsha
What'd you do yesterday?
'Cause when I read the blog story
Don't add up to what you told me
Hey Marsha
Hey Marsha
What'd you do yesterday
What I read on your blog story
Don't add up to what you told me
