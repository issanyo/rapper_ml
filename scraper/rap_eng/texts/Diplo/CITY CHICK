[Verse 1: Lorde]
Don't you think that it's boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasing a million things I want
And I am only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up from the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (Yeah)


[Verse 1: Apollo]
Macin' back and forth
She pulled up in a Porsche
D&G Sport
Sportin' Michael Kors
Coach in the courts
Shirts with the horse
Diamond imports
With her bracelet of quartz
Last name Laporte
Oh my lord she is gorg
Carpet escorts
When I get my awards
Then she's poppin' my corks
Course the Moet exports
Coming straight from the source
Yeah she likes how I score

[Verse 2: Lorde]
Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known?
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line, for the throne
But I know it's not forever (Yeah)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Apollo]
Fresh off the flight
She was lost in the lights
From the first sight
See her emeralds are bright
Yeah she comes at a price
I'm like yeah I might heist
Shes gotta glow
Like the Eiffel at night
Pari to NY
To sin city life
Miami LA
The skyline is nice
Yeah she flies out to Philly
To get her mind right
I'm like baby you crazy
But that's what I like

[Bridge]
It looked alright in the pictures
Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it?
I fall apart, with all my heart
And you can watch from your window (2x)


[Outro]
And talk it up like yeah (2x)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah
And talk it up like yeah (2x)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (Yeah)
