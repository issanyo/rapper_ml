[Verse 1]
I'm just tryin' to kick it like a bad habit
But I'm back at it catchin' onto mad static
I'm the ash catchin' cash stackin' hash addict
Do it 'till I'm asthmatic, yeah they tell me that's passion

But I can't stand it, livin' my life with a license to death
Livin' a life of regrets, givin' up all of the passion's the price of the debt
Strapped, yeah like packin' a knife and a tech
I can invest in me, but he who don't see Cannon as nice as the rest could end that shit, and that's it

No way you could mend that shit
I would not commend that shit. I really don't recommend that shit
But you could, so what's the point? Man I'm good, it's just a joint
I hold it down when I put one up; oh, this sound like I stood untouched

Well don't carry that belief cause my great barrier's the reef
And I'm hysterically weak, and so if ever you're in need
Of an inspiration to free yourself from needing the green
Better not put faith in this g, cause no one's fiendin' as me, shit

[Chorus]
Rollin' it like everyday, smokin' it like everyday
I'm dope again, I'm showin' them I'm goin' in like everyday
Any kush or any haze got many turned into a slave
I'm never pushed, I'm never fazed. A penny burned's a penny saved
[x2]

[Verse 2]
But what's a penny anyway when he's ready to descend into a state of unsteady until he break
On any day, any time, any place. Any second I could get it I reckon, so let me say:
I'm a heavy weight, I guess that makes me a champ. Only if you know me would you maybe advance that I've seen better days
I've been a slave to this habit, blowin' all this smoke and spittin' flames like a dragonÂ 

Ughh but I got to stop it, these constant bong hits is causin' me such exhaustion
Costing me to accomplish the least of all my options; at least I got a leash on this beast that's always barkin'
But it can't leave. I got a lease on life, but this shit ain't free
Quarter century, man I've been 18. I'm tryin' to grow up and cut down but this shit ain't me, so still I be...

[Chorus]
Rollin' it like everyday, smokin' it like everyday
I'm dope again, I'm showin' them I'm goin' in like everyday
Any kush or any haze got many turned into a slave
I'm never pushed, I'm never fazed. A penny burned's a penny saved
[x2]
