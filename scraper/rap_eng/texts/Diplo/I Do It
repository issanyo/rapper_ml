[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Thank God for the first nigga to start trapping
Thank God for the first nigga to start rapping
Thank God for the first girl to start stripping
And I'ma have to keep it muh'fuckin' real with 'em
I got a problem, with these niggas
I got a problem, with these bitches
Trigger finger, keep itchin'
Well I'll pull it, I'll do it, yeah

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz & All]
Yeah! Hang up on a bitch, call it crucified
Time to go to work, no suit and tie
Bumpin' Makaveli, I be trappin' out the telly
My nigga did a dime and he back already
Got that sack already, man we got them racks already
As far as your girl, I hit it from the back already
I tried to get a tan, but I'm black already
Your pockets on a diet, my pockets fat already
Three niggas with me, me myself and I
God don't like ugly, you should testify
My T-shirt come from Bergdorf
I make so much on a verse I take the third off
Bird call, swerve off
Bust a nut on her, tell her that's a load off
Shorty ass soft, like a Nerf ball
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Thank God for the first nigga to start trapping

Trigger finger, keep itchin'
Well I'll pull it, I'll do it, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake, Lil Wayne, Both & All]
Drank in my cup holder, hope this shit don't spill
Pull up in the new edition and that's word to Johnny Gill
How I come up with this shit and all these verses that I kill?
I have no imagination, everything I do for real
Bitch I'm camouflaged, down put your camera phone down
If she got a ass and the girl a fan, it's going down
I'ma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it
Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it
In the bedroom forever, that's what her roommate will tell you
Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you
He might call up Patricia, she 'bout to call up Melissa
Tell 'em come to the cribbo and do them both, double dribble
I'm colder than a hospital, she love the dick that I give her
Hit her from the front, back, side, twist her like cigarillos
I put the gun to the pillow, I don't want blood on my clothes
Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh, shoutout to all of my hoes
(Tunechi) That's just how my OG would sum it up
I been working all winter just to fuck the summer up
It's just me and 2 Chainz, but the chain's never tucked though
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga fuck y'all

[Hook: 2 Chainz]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne & All]
Well, if you know like I know, that pussy pop like pyro
And she know I'm a pothead, that pussy like a pothole
I’m colder than a snotnose, man all these hoes is my hoes
And if she bougie, fuck her once then leave her hanging, dry clothes
I just built a cemetery, niggas dying to get in
Niggas lying, they pretend, don’t cross that line, it's paper thin
High as a star, make a wish, I’m a shark, I ate the fish
I got no heart, I hate that bitch
You hate that bitch? Well I hate that bitch
Will jump a nigga like a chessboard
Do a drive by while you riding on your skateboard, uh
They ain't even know it
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet
Then I take her to the crib, man, fuck that bitch right on the step
Put it in and take it back out, then I back out
Hair-Hair Weave Killer known to snatch the fucking track out
Put me in the ga-game coach, I'm the antidote
Pull up, kick, throw and take the money, and the dope
True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane, and a boat
I am so cold, I need a cover, and a coat
Kick it at the mall, call it football
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

[Outro: Quartet]
(Y'all ready? 1, 2, 3)
Right now it's me time
(A little time for myself y'all) Me time
(Oh yeah) Right now it's me time
(Don't want no one else now) Me time
Bitch please don't call my phone (don't call my phone)
Said I wanna be left alone (be left alone)
Please, please don't stop by my home (stop by my home)
No, no cause I feel it's just a matter of time
'Til you people make me lose my mind
I'm 'bout to leave this world behind, yeah, yeah
Right now it's me time
(You need to go kick rocks now) Me time
