[Verse 1:]
Under your hard lens
Making making too few ends
Meet a middle ground I know, it's defense

Oily hands, slippery slope
Pointed fangs without scope

Understand me
I know
No mistaken time goes
Undeserved without, everything, everyone you know

Even if Will calls
Doesn't mean fall out
We once had a thing I know, vanished

All of my rights lingering
It isn't a place that I've been

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Shouldn't ever be what it was alright
I'll choose to believe what's right
Even if in the end I'm blind
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Couldn't ever be what it was, alright?

[Verse 2:]
Even if we send
Everything from both ends
So little left to, say, do, it depends

If we are past what we keep
All that was promised that was sheathed
No mention of our,â€¨unchecked accord
I leave this, without, regret, or hearsay
Even though I'll move on

Doesn't mean this goes strong
Can't believe it to be, undone, finished

Say what you want me to believe
Please show me something I can see

[Chorus:]

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Wouldn't ever be what it was alright
I'll choose to believe what's right
Even if if in the end I'm blind
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Shouldn't ever be what it was, alright
I'll choose to believe to believe what right
Even if in the end I'm blind
