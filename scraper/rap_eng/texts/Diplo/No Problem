I've got no problem

[Verse 1 x2]
No excuses out or in
Play like a motherfucking champion
When I do this lose or win
Play like a motherfucking champion

[Hook]
Nothing in this world comes for free
But I'm just trying to get it out
Nothing in the sun nobody gave me
Shake it till it pops out
Nothing in this world comes for free
But I'm just trying to get it

And tonight Imma do what I want

[Verse 1 x2]

[Hook]

And tonight Imma do what I want

[Verse 1 x2]
