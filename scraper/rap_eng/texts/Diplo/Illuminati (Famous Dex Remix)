[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yuh, yuh
Woke up on a cloud of sauce
Shoutout my mucus!
Yuh, yuh, yuh

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I got some money, no Illuminati (I got some money, no)
I got some money, no Illuminati (I got some money, no)
I got some money, no Illuminati (I got some money, no)
No chains on my body, your bitch on my body
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, 'Nati)
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, aye)
I got some money, no Illuminati (yuh, yuh, aye, aye)
No chains on my body, yo bitch on my bo-oh

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God & Lil Yachty]
I might pull up with a pocket and rocket
I pull out and cock it and pop it, huh
Reach in the back of my pocket
Four racks and I slapped on the top of her noggin, yeah
Yeah, slap on a bitch, huh
Pull out that MAC on a bitch, huh
I might just mack on your bitch, huh
.223 staff for the bitch, huh
Yeah, I tote 'em, I tote 'em, I tote 'em, I tote 'em
AR extendos, AK, yeah I tote 'em
I tote 'em, I tote 'em, I tote 'em, I tote 'em
My clip long as totem, your bitch lick my scrotum
Man, Lil Yachty and JBan$, they be my vrodem
Your bitch suck my toe just to know them
They pull up with a new medal like top of the soda
You still got the green on like Yoda (water)
Stain on my cup, mhmm, lean residue
Making new revenue, I'm hotter than the kettle boot
Um, phew, I be flyer than a cardinal
In a brand new cardigan, looking like a damn father do, uh
Diamond my ear, wet as a tear, I-I got no fear
Off-White label on the arm of my gear
And your eyes fear like headlights on a deer

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I got some money, no Illuminati (wet, wet, wet)
I got some money, no Illuminati
I got some money, no Illuminati
No chains on my body, your bitch on my body
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, 'Nati)
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, aye)
I got some money, no Illuminati (yuh, yuh, aye, aye)
No chains on my body, your bitch on my bo-oh

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
I got some money, just bought me a Audi
Catch your lil' bitch with me, she riding shotty
Ooh, lil' hotty, mama hotty
She wanna give me, sloppy-toppy
.30 on me, who gon' rob me?
Jewelry on me, ice body
Me and Ski ridin' Ferrari
Look at them bitches I tell that bitch sorry
Hol' up, I'm the man
50K, in my pants
Do a show, in Japan
Take my clothes off, yeah I do it for the fans (ayy, ooh, huh, yuh)
I got some money, no no fuck, what? (hah)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I got some money, no Illuminati (wet, wet, wet)
I got some money, no Illuminati
I got some money, no Illuminati
No chains on my body, your bitch on my body
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, 'Nati)
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, aye)
I got some money, no Illuminati (yuh, yuh, aye, aye)
No chains on my body, your bitch on my bo-oh (ay-ay, ayeee!)
