[Verse 1: Alex Clare]
Wakin' up in someone else's bed
Was what I was waitin' for
Oh my days what have I done
She saw me sneaking out the door
What have I been waiting for
Been wasting all my time
Watchin' my youth slip away
Surely is a crime

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Clare]
And no, she don't know what we do in our spare time
No she don't know that we've been up all night
All night, all night, all night

[Chorus: Alex Clare]
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning

[Verse 2: Alex Clare]
Sun is out while I'm walkin' home
And my heads up in the clouds
Trying to get my self to bed
But I really don't know how

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Clare]
And no, she don't know what I do in my spare time
No she don't know that we've been up all night
All night, all night, all night

[Chorus: Alex Clare]
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning

[Verse 3: Gilbere Fort√©]
Uh, my body running from my brain, can't find me
Smile on my face by the day [?]
Showed her through the town, but the town ain't around me
[?] lights on, [?] songs ain't counting
When I make it home, it's the question of the day
And will she find out my night play?
I'm out all night, never know where I stay
Party my ass off, damn, look at my face
Still smell good, ain't showered in two days
Cell phone off 'cause my bills ain't paid
Hey, life's a bitch, but who's gay?
Heard her number, never heard her name
Woman in my yard looking crazy, deranged
The closer I get, the quicker she's coming
Right for the head, oh shit, I'm running
I've been up all night, oh man, I'm something

[Bridge: Alex Clare]
When I get myself home to my bedroom
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets
When I get myself home to my bedroom
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets
When I get myself home to my bedroom
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets
When I get myself home to my bedroom
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets

[Chorus: Alex Clare]
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
