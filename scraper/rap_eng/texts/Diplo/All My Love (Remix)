[Verse 1: Machel Montano]
Hey DJ, bust de tune and then pull it up
If your cup's empty, full it up
Spread more love, cause we can't get enough
Baby girl, just start, wine it up
If the party nah nice, then me nah go
Just jump to the bass and piano
Live like a vacation in Key Largo
Listen the scenario
We doing it larger than life, larger than life
Spread love and then let it fly
Raise the levels higher than high, yeah
And push your hands in the sky, hands in the sky
Major Lazer, intensify
Raise the levels, higher than high, yeah
So start, turn it up (turn it up)

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & (Machel Montano)]
All your love will make us ache (Turn it up)
All your love is worth the chase (Let's turn it up)
All my love, I know where you'll find this (Turn it up)
On the rocks up on the mountain tops

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Machel Montano]
So leh we jump and show them, show them, show them, show them

Up on the mountain top

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love again
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say (So let's turn it up, turn it up)

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & (Machel Montanoo)]
All your love will make us ache (Let's turn it up, turn it up)
All your love is worth the chase (Let's turn it up, turn it up)
All my love, I know where you'll find this
On the rocks up on the mountain tops

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
You're always on my mind
Oh, there'll come a day
Day where we can fly
Reach the glory haze, oh, hey (tell them)
High up in the sun in the brighter sky
Sun in the brighter sky

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
All your love will make us ache
All your love is worth the chase
All my love, I know where you'll find this
On the rocks up on the mountain tops

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Machel Montano]
My love is larger than life, larger than life
All my love
It's larger than life, larger than life
All my love
Larger than life, larger than life
All my love
It's larger than life, larger than life
Up on the mountain top
Major Lazer

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
