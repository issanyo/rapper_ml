[Mr. Evil]
Now this is a story about my girlfriend Mary Jane
You ready mini me?? Okaay

[Verse]
Hello, Mary Jane, I can't get you off my brain
Take me higher then a crane
You're so sweet like sugarcane

You make me fly like Air Jamaica
You make me sing lke Anita Baker
Come with me cause I need to bake ya

Mary, Mary, quite contrary
Girl you must be my fairy
You give me wings like a canary
I'll shout so people can hear me

Mary Jane I love you dearly!
I always want you near me
You make me see clearly like
Jimmy spliff, I mean Jimmy Cliff!

Mary Jane I love you so, I won't ever let you go
Mary Jane I need you so, I won't ever let you go
Mary Jane I love you so, I won't ever let you go
Mary Jane I need you so, I won't ever let you go

My Boyfriend's name is Jay,
Everyday we spark a brain
Yes I am the Queen of Shiba
Mary Jane everynight I meet her

In the club is superrr
Johnny plays "Goodmorning Sir"
I feel nice but don't get gas
Kid, don't you know about the puff puff pass?

Hey Mr. Tamborine Man!

Legalize like Amsterdam
Yes he loves me even when I got the munchies
Mine is good he don't cum quick
So I suck his Buddha stick

Roll it, twist it, spark it up
Roll it twist it, spark it up
Okay...
Roll it twist it spark it up
