[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
We go hard
Till you get the picture
Then we make it bigger
Get this money
Blowing major figures
Can't take it with ya
We go hard
Till you get the picture
Then we make it bigger
We go shine
Till you get the picture
Then we make it bigger

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Hold up
Let me get up in this bitch
When I roll up
I'm straight doing ...
I got new hundreds and fifties
Keep your fives, tens and twenties
Only white girl with a ghetto ass
And a pair of fashion titties
I got heels stronger than your money
I ain't balling you funny
Put this whole world on a treadmill
I'mma spinning wheel and I'mma run it
Watch out talking about, about nothing
We got a ...
In that ...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
We go hard in a mothafucka
Put it on God
We dont give a damn if we catching no charge
We just shine for the ones locked up behind bars
...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spodee]
