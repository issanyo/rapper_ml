[Verse 1: Einstein]
Don't you like it when me shift your drawers one side
And roll on a condom and slide me stiff dick in-a ya fat pussy
Make ya feel like your home a tear down like a landslide
Don't ya like when me give ya it real tough
Make you reminisce, all yourself you a feel up
Turn your back, will hurt your knees up
How ya must come before me cause me know a no me fuss

[Chorus: Einstein]
When me beat it up like a fight
Ah, that she like, she love it like her life
Ah, that she like, scream 'til she no have no voice
Ah, that she like when me fuck her all night
Hear me now, when me beat it up like a fight
Ah, that she like, ahe love it like her life
Ah, that she like, scream 'til she no have no voice
Ah, that she like when me fuck her all night

[Verse 2: Einstein]
My girl, don't you like it when bad man give ya stiff cock
Make ya cry and no stop, say the fuck here is hot
You're cute, your breast's stiff and your pussy is fat
That's why me give you cock, what tough like it is a brick hut
Gal, open a ya legs like a gift shop
Wind 'pon the cock, it up, 'pon it you have it tick tock
Kerri a tell me 'bout Bruk and fix back
Me fuck her, make she run, left her flip flop

[Chorus: Einstein]
When me beat it up like a fight
Ah, that she like, she love it like her life
Ah, that she like, scream 'til she no have no voice
Ah, that she like when me fuck her all night
Hear me now, when me beat it up like a fight
Ah, that she like, she love it like her life
Ah, that she like, scream 'til she no have no voice
Ah, that she like when me fuck her all night

Always and forever
I bet you ain't never seen
A pussy so sweet
Or tasted anything better

Get to know me, get to know me
Put your face inside my sweater
Slide your fingers in my panties
And make ma pussy wetter

I would let you should you let me
Grab your dick and make it hard
Wrap your hands around it
?

So, ? come and get me
Put your tongue on it
And lick me
