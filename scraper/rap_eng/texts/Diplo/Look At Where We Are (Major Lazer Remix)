From the deep silence of my mind
Is something I'm trying to find
When it speaks you know you will hear my name
Not so complex in design
But harder to mind
As I step, in vain
Won't you come down to my arms
There's something I'm ready to say
Would you call, my name

Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each others love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name
Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each others love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name

A memory tells us that we're blessed
But opening up this chest
I discovered that a heart is lame
Falling behind what we guess
But trying to do our best
Do we stop, do we stop in frame
Won't you come back to my heart
There's something I'm trying to say
Would you call, my name

Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each others love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name
Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each others love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name
