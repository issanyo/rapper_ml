[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
Oh dear, one turn the lights off
So our horny souls can have some private time
And the morning comes with the bittersweet news
You're still no hero diving the blue
Well, Hallelujah, it's a new day
We're a little closer

[Pre-Chorus]
Days are slipping away
Shadows stay, boy
If you're in love beneath the paint
What a pleasant sensation

[Chorus]
Oh, why do everyone have to grow old?
Everyone wonder where the good times go
Oh, why do everyone have to grow old?
Wanna be free
Wanna be free
Wanna get 'em
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Hope, play a song for the wounded
So it will be summer forevermore, baby
The morning comes with the rain for your
Bloody dry skin who's about to give in
Oh well, hallelujah, it's a miracle

[Pre-Chorus]
Days are slipping away
Shadows stay, boy
If you're in love beneath the paint
What a pleasant sensation

[Chorus]
Oh, why do everyone have to grow old?
Everyone wonder where the good times go
Oh, why do everyone have to grow old?
Wanna be free
Wanna be free
Wanna get 'em
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
