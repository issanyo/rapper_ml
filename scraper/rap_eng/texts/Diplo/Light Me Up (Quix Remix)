[Verse 1: Miguel]
You can dry your tears every time us change
Calm your fears, you can climb again
We forget that it's so easy to love when everything is good
Don't compare, 'cause every sea sees rain
While you're here, just know I'll hold your hand
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel & Julia Michaels]
And I will guide you
Let me remind you
Heights I would fly to
Depths I would dive to
Yeah, I'll always find you

[Chorus: Miguel]
So baby, light me up
You can breathe me in
I'ma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, yeah, oh
Yeah, baby, light me up
You can breathe me in
I'ma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
So baby, light me up
You can breathe me in

[Post-Chorus: Miguel / Instrumental Drop: QUIX]
Baby, light me up, up
You can breathe me in
Baby, light me up, up
You can breathe me in
Baby, light me up, up
You can breathe me
Baby, light me up, up
You can breathe me in

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
Sure, we have our fights
Sure, we have our doubts
Sure, we lie, but we're not lying now
We know why
'Cause it's so easy to love when everything is good
Hold my skin, hold me in your hands
Let's begin, to give you all I am
Mmm, to give you all I am

[Pre-Chorus: Julia Michaels]
And I will guide you
Let me remind you
Heights I would fly to
Depths I would dive to
Yeah, I'll always find you

[Instrumental Drop: QUIX]
Baby light-- Breathe
I'll always
Baby light-- Breathe
