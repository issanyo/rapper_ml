[Verse 1]
Yeah
They thought that you was a shy girl
Until I made you my girl
Girl you pushed me like a big button
'Til I cuffed you like you did somethin'
You ain't gotta wait for it
You ain't gotta wait for me to give you my love
You ain't gotta wait for it
Things are gettin' sticky, girl I think that I'm stuck

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll admit I'm wrong when I know that you gon' come for me
When you gon' come for me, yeah
Never gonna not not hit that, your lovin' is drugs to me
When you gon' come to me, yeah
And every time you hit my phone, when you say you need company, oh
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you

[Chorus]
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you

[Verse 2]
Girl you used to bein' quiet
'Til I brought that loud
You say your dollars is a mountain
And your mama your accountant
You watch your figure 'cause you a big deal
Got your fresh prince and a big whip
Polo mink coat, that's a big kill
Put you on a foreign like a windshield

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll admit I'm wrong when I know that you gon' come for me
When you gon' come for me, yeah
Never gonna not not hit that, your lovin' is drugs to me
When you gon' come to me, yeah
And every time you hit my phone, when you say you need company, oh
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you

[Chorus]
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you

[Bridge]
Where are you going when I need you most?
Why do we let things get too far before you decide to come home?
I just wanna talk a likkle
Walk a likkle
Wan fi see yuh jiggle
Want you baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll admit I'm wrong when I know that you gon' come for me
When you gon' come for me, yeah
Never gonna not not hit that, your lovin' is drugs to me
When you gon' come to me, yeah
And every time you hit my phone, when you say you need company, oh
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you

[Chorus]
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you
