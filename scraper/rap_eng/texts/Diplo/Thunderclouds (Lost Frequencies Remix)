[Chorus: Labrinth]
You’re sayin’ those words like you hate me now
Our house is burning when you’re raised in hell
Here in the ashes your soul cries out
But don’t be afraid of these thunderclouds

[Verse 1: Labrinth]
All I need is love
All I need is a word
All I need is us
You turned nouns into verbs, to verbs

[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth & Sia]
Where did love go?
When all is said and done? Yeah
Hey now put your hands in the air
I’mma go through your stuff
Where did love go?
You put the running into run
You’re asking me to stay
But I never met a man I could trust (Yeah)

[Chorus: Sia, Sia & Labrinth]
You’re sayin’ those words like you hate me now
Our house is burning when you’re raising hell
Here in the ashes your soul cries out
But don’t be afraid of these thunderclouds

[Outro: Labrinth & Sia]
These thunderclouds
Oh no, these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds
Oh no no, these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds
Oh no, these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds
Oh no no, these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds
