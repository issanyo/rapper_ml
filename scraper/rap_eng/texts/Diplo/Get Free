[Verse 1]
Never got no love from a government man
Heading down the stream 'till the levee gives in
What I gotta do to get the money?
We ain't got the money, we ain't got enough

[Verse 2]
Heading down the stream 'till the levee gives in
Help, my dreams are wearing thin
All I need's relief, I need, I need some sympathy

[Chorus]
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We can never be free
I just wanna be

Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We can never be free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Verse 3]
All my life been wading in
Water so deep now we've got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long, how long do we have a friend

[Chorus]
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We can never be free
I just wanna be

Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We can never be free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We can never be free
I just wanna be

Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We can never be free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream
