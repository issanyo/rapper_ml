[Chorus]
They don't pay to see
There are eyes on me
I'll be riding high with the sound and style
That's all my own believing
Better the two of us to give it up
Their reasoning is colored in by a dream they had in yearning

[Verse 1]
And if they want you they can raise their eyes up into the sun
Then you can give them what they want,
You don't need a reason
Forget the story 'bout the one who said to give up the sun

[Chorus]
They don't pay to see
There are eyes on me
I'll be riding high with the sound and style
That's all my own believing
Better the two of us to give it up
This life of ours
Harder than they say
Their reasoning is colored in by a dream they had in yearning

[Verse 2]
They say you're gonna try
Say you're gonna fly
Then the lights go down
It's a drowning crowd
You're super close to heaven
And if they want you they can raise their eyes up into the sun
But you can't give what you don't have, if for no other reason
You heard the story on the one who nearly gave up the sun

[Chorus]
I'll be riding high with the sound and style that's all my own believing
Their reasoning is colored in by a dream they had in yearning

[Verse 4]
Say you're gonna try
Say you'll do it fine
Then the lights go down
It's a drowning cry
Super close to heaven

[Outro]
And if they want you they can raise their eyes up into the Sun
But you can't give what you don't have, if for no other reason
Don't give the story on the one who gave up the Sun
