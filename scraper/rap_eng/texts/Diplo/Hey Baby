[Intro: Deb's Daughter & Kid Ink]
Ay baby, hey baby
Kid Ink, Vegas
Ay baby, hey baby
Mike, Diplo

[Verse 1: Deb's Daughter]
You want it all
All alone, walking high on the wire
You want it all
Or you brag that you're lost in the fire
Before you fall
Let me show you me love that you know you've been searching for
You've been searching for
Now you got me saying

[Chorus: Deb's Daughter]
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath, let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath, let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Hey babe, how you doing, where you from?
I see you move that thing to the jump
Hey babe, you throw that alley oop, I'mma jump
Girl, you know exactly what I want
First, let me blow your mind, get you faded
Dressed in all black, that's me shaded
Usually I'm thinking green, I'll be jaded
Don't let me down, don't let my heart drop
Tell me what you want, I might take one
I don't wanna sleep 'til the day comes
Baby, you've been trying hard not to be involved
I got my shades on, but I see it all

[Verse 3: Deb's Daughter]
I see it all
You could run, you could hide if you like
I see it all
See you lost all the light in your eyes
I'm standing tall
Let me show you me love that you know you've been looking for
What you waiting for?
Now you got me saying

[Chorus: Deb's Daughter]
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath, let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath, let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine

[Outro: Kid Ink & Deb's Daughter]
Hey babe, everything tonight [?]
Or everything you trying to do
I see you thinking 'bout it while you bite your lip
Babe, tell me what you got to lose
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath, let me blow your mind
Tell me what you got to lose
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
