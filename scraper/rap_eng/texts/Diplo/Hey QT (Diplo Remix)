[Intro]
Hey QT
H-Hey QT
H-H-Hey QT
H-H-Hey QT

[Chorus]
Hey QT, yeah?
Yeah, there's something I want to say
I feel your hands on my body
Every time you think of me
Hey QT, yeah?
Even though you're so far away
I feel your hands on my body
Every time you think of me, boy
Hey QT, yeah?
Yeah, there's something I want to say
I feel your hands on my body
Every time you think of me
Hey QT, yeah?
Even though you're so far away
I feel your hands on my body, body

Hey
Hey QT

[Drop]

[Verse 1]
So I've been thinking about you quite a lot
It's not that I don't
I just really want to take you with
Everywhere I go
Yesterday, I was out driving around
The night was so black
And the lights were so blinding
Suddenly I saw a flash in the sky
I felt your warmth and I knew you were sitting right beside

[Chorus]
Hey QT, yeah?
Yeah, there's something I want to say
I feel your hands on my body
Every time you think of me
Hey QT, yeah?
Even though you're so far away
I feel your hands on my body, body

Hey
Hey QT

[Drop 2]

[Outro]
Hey QT
