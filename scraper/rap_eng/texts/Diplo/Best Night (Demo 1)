[Verse 1]
Champagne, caviar
We’re going out on a town
Do you wanna go far
City lights on the sky
Dressed up and sexed up
Put this crystal on ice
Let me take you out tonight
Making love under the stars so bright
I don’t wanna talk too much
Gonna speak to your body
Words can’t touch

[Chorus]
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

[Verse 2]
Gold chains, big cigars
I wanna light up your body
Like a you’re movie star
Put our names on the list
Gonna grab us some rope
And blow the camera a kiss
Diamonds dancing on my flesh
Bout to smoke your favourite stash
Pay with love
Don’t need no cash
Gonna turn up your body
Put this shit on blast

[Chorus]
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

[Bridge]
Take you where nobody's gone before
Take you all the way to heaven's door
Feel my heartbeat lying next to yours
On this floor, on this floor
Take you where nobody's gone before
Take you all the way to heaven's door
Feel my heartbeat lying next to yours
On this floor, on this floor
On this floor, on this floor
On this floor, on this floor
Feel my heartbeat lying next to yours
On this floor

[Chorus]
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

[Verse 1]
Champagne, caviar
We’re going out on a town
Do you wanna go far
City lights on the sky
Dressed up and sexed up
Put this crystal on ice
Let me take you out tonight
Making love under stars so bright
I don’t wanna talk too much
Gonna speak to your body
Words can’t touch
