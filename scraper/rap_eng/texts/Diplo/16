(Break it down, break it down, let me break it down
Break it down)

[Verse 1]
I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said, "hey boy, come on right around"
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to
Say, parents tryna find out what we were up to
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Saying, fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night

[Post-Chorus]
Spit a sixteen, a quick sixteen
I been doing doing this since I was sixteen
Been a few years, let's call it sixteen
A brand new flow for two thousand sixteen
Spit a sixteen, a quick sixteen
I been doing doing this since I was sixteen
Been a few years, let's call it sixteen
A brand new flow for two thousand sixteen
Seems like I'm living a dream
Nineteen ninety nine when I first came on the scene
[?]
With a bunch of melodies for days, know what I mean?
Lean and mean, embodied the whole scene
Packin' on muscle like bars of protein
[?] holdin'
'Cause you know I've been trainin' [?]

[Verse 2]
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, "hey girl, come on right around"
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping oh yeah, oh yeah
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night

[Post-Chorus]
Its best at sixteen, it's sick with sixteen
I been doing doing this since I was sixteen
Been a few years, let's call it sixteen
A brand new flow for two thousand sixteen
Its best at sixteen, it's sick with sixteen
I been doing doing this since I was sixteen
Been a few years, let's call it sixteen
A brand new flow for two thousand sixteen
[?] so let me run up on this beat
No nonsense whenever you're 'round me
It don't make sense, my time ain't wasted
[?] we know that's a long ting
But then I sing, I flip the whole ting
One verse sung, one verse I be rappin'
I never get bored to a beat that's thumpin'
[?] press stop and start beatboxin'
