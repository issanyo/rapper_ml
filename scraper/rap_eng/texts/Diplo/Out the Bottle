[Intro]
Yea
Go Hard
Go wide

[Hook]
Drinking out the bottle got me turnt
When am I gon' learn
She wanna' hang wit' Sasha But she gotta wait her turn
Ain't no clones in my zone, all my bitches so official
You hurt me then I cut you off, I bet that I won't miss you
Now that bottle got me turnt
Drinking drinking out that bottle got me turnt
Drinking drinking out that bottle got me turnt
When am I gon' learn
She wanna' hang wit' Sasha But she gotta wait her turn

[Verse]
Now That bottle got me turnt, I swear that I am in it
I'm not a superhero, if I got it imma' spend it
Sasha [?] got me in it, I'm gon' head spinning
I'm Rome and I should've stayed at home from the beginning
Drinking out the bottle, body moving like a freak
He wanna' be hubby, thumbs down he's super weak
Money super tall, it might fall all over the feet
You can keep on talking stick, the top you'll probably never reach
I'm fucked up, momma' please excuse my speech
Ain't no rules to be this flee
A bitch in my lane I don't see
I'm fucked up, momma' please excuse my speech
Ain't no rules to be this flee
A bitch in my lane I don't see

[Hook]
Drinking out that bottle got me turnt
Drinking drinking out that bottle got me turnt
Drinking drinking out that bottle got me turnt
Drinking drinking out that bottle got me turnt
When am I gon' learn
She wanna' hang wit' Sasha But she gotta wait her turn
Drinking out the bottle got me turnt
When am I gon' learn
She wanna' hang wit' Sasha But she gotta wait her turn
Ain't no clones in my zone, all my bitches so official
You hurt me then I cut you off, I bet that I won't miss you

[Outro]
