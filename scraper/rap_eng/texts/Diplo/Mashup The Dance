Well you catch em til it's on, so come and lick it off
Off shit ah boom, pipe, water
Fun to you, I'm no crab you a tata
You ah walk out then my lamb to the slaughter
If a woman in the bomb, you know I fire quarter
I talk a beast, my wine be a partner
If it's some of them all, Chris the young rapper
Come up them young and I know the shino shada
Reverb it like paper, more than the things here, we are the innovator
I'm the one, talk the worship come nobody, cause no grip
While plenty with me, is that too believe?
Chance like theater, I no pon the filter
Impressive gyal, gosh I feel me me a weirder
I'm a real gangsta, I'ma not sis
Should get a gyal to the road like the bishop
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
Scopin out the place, me a gangsta
When I be out, swear I'm stuntin alfa
Scopin out the place, me a gangsta
Make them know it and know why we no answer
And I done fanser, yea freelancer
We know every woman that salute every month ah
Go by the swap, Major Blazer, plenty one, watch out
When we're in the jungle, that thought miss and sure to crumble
Try walk through, don't try no assemble
Try all your mode, don't try the umbrella
Shawty, party not special
Party, party not special
Be now, watch as though my name condor
Don't go make it on tour
Any time demand the stereo, you know dem mash it up
Any time demand the stereo, you know dem mash it up
Any time demand the stereo, you know dem mash it up
If you never know a Major Lazer take it to the top
Any time demand the stereo, you know dem mash it up
Any time demand the stereo, you know dem mash it up
Any time demand the stereo, you know dem mash it up
If you never know a Major Lazer take it to the top
Any time demand the stereo, you know dem mash it up
That I should stop, That I should stop
That I should stop, That I should stop
That I should stop, That I should stop
Mashup the dance dance dance
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
Mashup the dance, mashup the dance
