[Verse 1]
I'm in the fields now
Jump off dem porch outside man dem see no safe
We're in the same clothes as yesterday so you know I don't think twice
Worry, naw, about what dem say, aw
Me no worry, naw, live my life today, aw
Rise dis mornin', me feel like a champion
Naw we go mash up this world y'know so the vibe can don
I'm infarmah, boy y'know I'm mista rasta
Me now stand tall like a roadblock
Hand 'pon my steel with a guncock
​Pam pam pam pam pam
​
​[Drop]

[Chorus]
Hot hot, see me burn it like a fire
Burn a little herb dis fi take me higher
Dem, dem, can't tell me nothing 'bout mine
Imma live it up, they upon the frontline

[Verse 2]
Can't get no peace now
Dem don't start the war so dem can't get no rest
Come 'pon my side Coll and grasp 'pon me chest
Listen up now my youth
Worry, naw, about what dem say, aw
Me no worry, naw, live my life today, aw
Rise dis mornin', me feel like a champion
Naw we go mash up this world y'know so the vibe can don
I'm infarmah, boy y'know I'm mista rasta
Me now stand tall like a roadblock
Hand 'pon my steel with a guncock
​Pam pam pam pam pam

​[Drop]

[Chorus]
Hot hot, see me burn it like a fire
Burn a little herb dis fi take me higher
Dem, dem, can't tell me nothing 'bout mine
Imma live it up, they upon the frontline
Hot hot, see me burn it like a fire
Burn a little herb dis fi take me higher
Dem, dem, can't tell me nothing 'bout mine
Imma live it up, they upon the frontline
