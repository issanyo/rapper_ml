[Verse 1]
Wander around in the city I know
Old blossom in a new born flow
Sings in my head, what a lovely tune
You know that I crave to meet you soon

The stars are shining upon my eyes
Reminding me of why I play nice
And the bad boy la-di-di la-di-da
Makes me wanna tear my white skin apart

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time to go digging the town
And tonight is the night
And tonight is alright
It's time to go down the road
The road you know, tonight we go, we go

[Chorus]
I don't wanna dance with nobody
Dance with nobody, dance with nobody
I don't wanna dance with nobody
Dance with nobody, dance

(Cool thing you make the streets a wonder)

[Verse 2]
Wonder, wonder, where bodies they go
Running me down, I really don't know
When to stop and when to begin
I won't go and make my little heart sink

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time to go digging the town
And tonight is the night
And tonight is alright
It's time to go down the road
The road you know, tonight we go, we go

[Chorus]
I don't wanna dance with nobody
Dance with nobody, dance with nobody
I don't wanna dance with nobody
Dance with nobody, dance

[Chorus 2]
I'm on my own and I'm crazy for you
Got the creeps by the way your body moves
I don't wanna dance with nobody
Dance with nobody, dance with nobody
But you

Watch you move to the early morning
Wish you would go in the early morning

[Chorus 2]
I'm on my own and I'm crazy for you
Got the creeps by the way your body moves
I don't wanna dance with nobody
Dance with nobody, dance with nobody
But you

[Chorus 2]
I'm on my own and I'm crazy for you
Got the creeps by the way your body moves
I don't wanna dance with nobody
Dance with nobody, dance with nobody
But you

(Cool thing you make the streets a wonder)
