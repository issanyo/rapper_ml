(Verse)
Lots of this people don't get it
I'm hittin' these streets with that fire
I'm not gonna stop, never, ever
I'm back with that new heat
Y'all been waitin' on
You gonna see
What I been workin'
This is just somethin'
To give y'all time
Get prepared
I'm runnin' this shit this time

(Verse)
Lots of shit go'n drop
But who you really carin' about
Most my shit go'n pop
You'll be wearin' it out
This is My Kingdom
Runnin' this shit for seasons
Stay out of my region
Or you'll get defeated
Step up in the buildin' lookin' all nice
Talkin' that talk, nope I never say it twice
I'm in this game, makin' this money
I'm on my grind, ain't worried bout these other bunnies
I'm a predator, you the prey
I'ma put a show on, a play
If you gotta problem with the way I'm really runnin' it
You can get to dun-in it, cause you no good wit it
Take a simple rap song and turn it into a worldwide hit
Y'all know that I'm braggin', I always do that shit
Cause I can
You been a fan
I got a plan
To take it to another fuckin' level
You didn't know I could do that
Step to them people like I rule that, I rule that
You ragedy ann bitches
I've said it millions of times, y'all go'n leave with stitches
If I got the pitches
Best believe I'm walkin' out with all the riches
Oh, man
Oh no
I'm comin' back for the crown
Watch me explode
I'm go'n grow
Bitch I'm grown
Now make like E.T. and phone yo ass home
