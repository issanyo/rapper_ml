Shells on the floor
The writing's on the wall
Bullets in your store
Says "I'm hunting for you all"

Field full of dope
I'm harvesting my hope
Shipping out speed boats
So we're not broke

Coca-cola floats
The stock market broke
Somewhere in Angola we're still craving for a goat

Send me a post
Yeah, send me something you wrote
School of the hard knocks
We don't like to boast

Go down the road
Their cars are rolling slow
Boys fighting laws
Got their AKs on show

Kids playing ball
They growing like they know
Wanna make that doe
Just to have something to show

Buy Tees and Gold
Bandanas and hoes
Freedom costs money and they're feeling really bored

Vitamins are low
Amphetamines high
Busting out shots
On rings and chicken pie

Shells on the floor
The writing's on the wall
Bullets in your store
Says "I'm hunting for you all"

Fields filled with dope
I'm harvesting my hope
Shipping out speed boats
So we're not broke

Why you gotta make me out like this
Why you gotta make me out like this
I never wanted none of this shit
Why you gotta make me out like this
I never asked for none of this shit
Why you gotta make me out like this

Talking about, talking about war war war
I rather talk about moi
Talking about, talking about war war war
I rather talk about moi
Talking about, talking about war war war
I rather talk about moi
Talking about, talking about war war war
I rather talk about moi
Talking about, talking about war war war
I rather talk about moi
