[Verse 1: Sia]
We got a ride, we got the night
I got the bottle, you got the light
We got the stars (stars)
We got audio
We're gonna fly, we're getting high
You got the moon dust, I got the sky
We got the stars
We got audio, au-au-audio

[Pre-Chorus: Sia & Both]
Make the bomb bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the bomb bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the song so sweet
You gon' come home with me, oh
Make the bomb bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the bomb bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the song so sweet
You gon' come home with me, oh

[Hook: Diplo]
Ay, ay

[Chorus: Sia]
We got a ride, we got the night
I got the bottle, you got the light
We got the stars (stars)
We got audio

[Verse 2: Labrinth & Sia]
You got the heart, we got the soul
Just when the world saying they got no hold
Here comes the love
We got audio (a-audio)
We flying high, Superhero
S on my chest, with my Marilyn Monroe
Feel like a star (star)
Cause we got audio
(Make it go!)

[Pre-Chorus: Sia & Both]
Make the bomb bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the bomb bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the song so sweet
You gon' come home with me, oh
(Make it go!)
Make the bomb bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the bomb bomb beat
I'll give you melody
Make the song so sweet
You gon' come home with me, oh

[Chorus: Labrinth & Sia]
You got the heart, we got the soul
Just when the world saying they got no hold
Here comes the love
We got audio (a-audio)
We got audio
We got audio
