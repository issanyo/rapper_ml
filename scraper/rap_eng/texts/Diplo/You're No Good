[Intro]
You’re no good for me
But the way you movin at me, oh it might be
You want a Jamaican one

[Verse 1]
She say she love me and I’m nice
Love inna di daytime, Love inna the night
She say if loving me is wrong
No time at all, she don’t wanna be right
She touch me, it all become nice
She love me, for the rest of her life
D drop it down, round kiss on mi spine
Touch and make a sweet song, on top of all things

My uh uh uh uh uh

[Verse 2]
If I had you back
I’ll never let you go another way
Not for the life of me
How could you imagine that?
Well my mistake that send you on your way
Well nothing I can say
To you like drops of water
Don’t ask me what went wrong
Can’t turn back the damage I’ve done
Can’t take em back after I’m gone
A fool to keep on trying
Can’t make me walk away
‘Cause baby I’m back and as I’m getting strung that you’ll be back one day
