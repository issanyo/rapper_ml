[Hook x 2: Riff Raff]
I’m not coming home tonight
I’m not coming home tonight
I got a pocket full of cash, a car full of gas
So I’m not coming home tonight, home tonight

[Verse 1: Dirt Nasty]
I ain't coming home tonight
Just got a case of Coors Light
I’mma get another DUI
Sorry fat ass, this my life
I won’t be back I’m sorry
I’m at a Three Loco party (Viva!)
Fuckin’ a cholo barbie
In Cocoa Beach, so gnarly
I don’t wanna come home
Bitch, just let a dog roam
Hell nah I didn’t answer my phone
I was all alone doin’ drugs in a school zone

[Verse 2: Andy Milonakis]
Fuck home I don’t even wanna go there
On the road, the road to Saint Elsewhere
I ain’t lost I’m just cruisin’ Black
I found two bitches that go ass to ass
Motel 6 ain’t up to par
So fuck it; I’ll just sleep in my car
Woke up on the edge of the earth
I don’t wanna go back, it ain’t worth it
Now I’m in Paris with Euro hoes
They French kissin’ my dick now I’ll never go home

[Verse 3: Riff Raff]
Billy Jean, Charlie Sheen
My blunt looks like a burrito supreme. (taco!)
I can front page of the magazine
Now she in my face, Maybelline
Rap game Madonna, stirke a pose
Bad bitch at mi casa, foldin clothes (laundry!)
Now I’m Burt Reynolds with the Listerine (washhh)
Live half my life in a limousine
I pour my four in my Zima
My bitch ass look like Trina
Like MC Hammer have you seen her?
