[Verse: Mr Eazi]
I will fight for you (yeah, yeah)
Only if you need me to yeah
You know see I got you yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me if you got me too
Tell me if you got me too
Say me I don't know why but me never stop thinking about you
About you

[Chorus: Mr Eazi & RAYE]
Can we get this thing tied up?
Can we get this thing tied up?
You know this thing is inside us
Baby, can we get this thing tied up?
Can we get this thing tied up?
You know this thing is inside us
Baby, can we get this thing tied up?
Can we get this thing tied up?
Baby, can we get this thing tied up?
You know this thing is inside us
