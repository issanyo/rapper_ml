[Verse 1]
I feel the sunlight on my head
The scent of summer in my bed
When we were footprints in the sand
Stealing liquor, making plans

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see your face from miles and miles away
But heaven knows it's gonna fade, heaven knows it's gonna fade
I'm a dog searching for reasons and a way
Back to your hands you make me tremble, make me crash
Forget my name

[Chorus]
And just ride that wave until we higher than life
With the sun in our eyes
Yeah, just ride on that cloud until we fall from the sky
No more tears for the night
For the ni-i-i-i-i-ight
For the ni-i-i-i-i-ight
Yeah, just ride that wave until we higher than life
With the sun in our eyes

[Verse 2]
They said to watch out for your kind
I watched out and it blew my mind
They say that romance makes you blind
Well, I'll be blinded for a lifetime

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can see your face from miles and miles away
And I remember every kiss, all the games you had me play
I'm a dog searching for answers and a way
Back to your hands you make me tremble, make me crash
Forget my name

[Chorus]
And just ride that wave until we higher than life
With the sun in our eyes
Yeah, just ride on that cloud until we fall from the sky
No more tears for the night
For the ni-i-i-i-i-ight
For the ni-i-i-i-i-ight
Yeah, just ride that wave until we higher than life
With the sun in our eyes

[Post-Chorus]
For the ni-i-i-i-i-ight
For the ni-i-i-i-i-ight
Yeah, just ride that wave until we higher than life
With the sun in our eyes
