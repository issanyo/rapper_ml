[Verse 1: Kai]
You love how you push me to the point of crazy
And I love when you're on your knees and begging for me
You got me good with all these mind games
There you go, you got my heart again

[Pre-Chorus: Kai]
Say my name, I wanna hear you call
Hold me close, I wanna feel your heart
I'm in a cold sweat and I want you bad
Now you got me all in my head, like damn

[Chorus: Skrillex]
I'ma show you how, show you how, show you how
To love again
I'ma show you how, show you how, show you how
To love again
I'ma show you how, show you how, show you how
To love again
I'ma show you how, show you how, show you how
To love again
