Alabama, the place I love, the place I call home
Dirt roads and the projects, Momma stay gone
But it really don't matter, Gramma stay up the road
And she fixin' me some collards
Alabama, the place I love, the place I call home-
Dirt roads and the projects, all that I've known
I love my mama but my grandmama stay up the road
And she fixin' me some collards

[Jhi-Ali]
It's been a long time comin', we've been on the grind hustlin'
Ever since, cotton pickin', learn about your history, cousin!
It's the state, of mind, and it's been too hard livin'
Dem folks'll lynch ya down hurr, give ya two hard sentence
Now is it worth those years to twerk o's? Then say yeah
The birds flyin' over the dirt road' (heh) down here
Alabama, the final piece of the puzzle
Say it backwards, I'm a balla, in the streets, and I HUSTLE
Holdin' on the hope, I know that change gone come
They got us holdin' onto dope, we know that change gone come
So sick and tired of being broke mane, it's the same old song
But 'til my folks gon get some doe mane, the song gon get sung
It's been a long time, until we realize, that we sittin' on
The gold mine, we gone roam round
Tryin' to rock somethin' 'cept our own style
Tryin' to bump somethin' accept for our own sounds
And I ain't tryna come down, I'm just sayn' mane, roll Tide!

I wake up every mornin', thank the Lord and roll up me a Swisher
Kiss my babies, throw my J's on, go rollin' with my niggas
Slow motion mane, Cooley certified, I'm a Florida boy in Alabama
But really we got the same dirty pride
I put my pen to this paper to shake the fact that
If you know it or not, yo life ain't shit but blackjack
Hit a hole, raise a fold for all of you poker playas
Back here in these woods, you would never really know a playa
Never no different, believe, son, I'm a make my change up
Get up my money 'till I'm comfortable, then change jobs
But outchea, here my cuz just thrown off in the wind
Blown off in the wind, gone off Seagram's Gin, gettin' bent
I'm a sucka for that 'bread, playa, WEAK for some collard greens
And believe these streets got a lot of green, a LOT of greens
Time flies, flyest when gettin' high
Hunstville where I reside, so Alabama till I die

[Big P.O.P.E.]
I wake up early in the morning
Thank the Lord for me being country, 'Bama
Up in this here, and you know we gone act a donkey
We golden through it all, but it still remains
Funky niggas talk 'bout my state
But I know that those hoes can't touch us
That's just the way it is, cause we makin' it on the grind
You might be takin' theirs, ain't no hope in you takin' ours
That's just the way we feel, been at it and aggravated
But now we stand on top, and I know that we can't be faded
And I'm gone keep it crunk, with rhymes, 'cause' I got so many
And I ain't scared to dump cause I'm a god with this 'Bama in me
Nigga, shit
I'm a god with this 'Bama in me
