[Verse 1]
All our dreams sleep tonight
They’ll be safe as we fight
In the journey of the best
And I know I’ve caused you a lot of blues
Now the last one’s playing for you
But I couldn’t go without letting you know this

[Verse 2]
I guess our love somehow
Was too crazy to work out
I’m crazy about you, but I can’t, it just can’t do
And we wait until the morning
Then our lives are moving on
With no words, you'll do fine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I never wanna know the name
Of your new girlfriend
Never wanna hear about it
Keep her stains away

[Chorus]
I never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know

[Verse 3]
I dry my eyes on the highway
And think about why I couldn't stay
And why I should have, cause I love you
But the wind blows again
And the life moves on, my friend
With some words we wrote down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I never wanna know the name
Of your new girlfriend
Never wanna hear about it
Keep her stains away

[Chorus]
I never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know

[Bridge]
Hey, all of a sudden I was brain dead and rattled
With the thoughts of you and I, and I wanted to goodbye you
But the nights are so cold, how I need your human soul
I would never let you go, if I'd been a little older

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No, no, no, I never wanna know, no, no
I never wanna hear about her
Keep her stains away

[Chorus]
I never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know

[Outro]
But I never wanna know know the name
Of your new girlfriend
Never wanna hear about it
Keep her stains away
