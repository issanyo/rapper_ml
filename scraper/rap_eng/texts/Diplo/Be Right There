[Verse 1: Priscilla Renea]
I've got all this love, waiting just for you
I just gotta know that your love is true
Can't keep running, boy, in and out my life
Wanna be your girl, not 'cause the mood is right
If I let you go inside, tomorrow, will you hide?
Will you be there for me when I need someone to hold?
Baby, don't misunderstand, I do want you for my man
I just need a little time, before I invest my love

[Chorus: Priscilla Renea]
Don't walk away, boy (Mmm, don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (No, no)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
I'll be right there for you (Don't walk away)
Don't walk away, boy (Mmm, don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (No, no)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
I'll be right there for you
I'll be right there for you

[Bridge: Priscilla Renea]
I’ve got all this love (All this love, all this love), waiting just for you
I’ve got all this love (All this love, all this love), waiting just for you
I’ve got all this love (All this love, all this love), waiting just for you
I’ve got all this love (All this love, all this love)

[Chorus: Priscilla Renea]
Don't walk away, boy (Mmm, don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (No, no)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
I'll be right there for you (Don't walk away)
Don't walk away, boy (Mmm, don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (No, no)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
I'll be right there for you
I'll be right there for you
