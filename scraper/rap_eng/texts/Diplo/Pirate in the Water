[Hook]
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)

There's a pirate in the water
There's a price to pay tonight (Yeah)
On the dock, the sea looks smooth
But it's tainted in the light (Yeah)

Fear not the holes you're sinkin' into
Don't let 'em take you like the buccaneers do
We on the look, we tryin' to get through
You're fumigated if you kill 'em off too

[Hook]
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)

Tryin' to make it to the harbor
Racin' time against the light
Tellin' me you got much to lose
Still you're ruthless with your life

Come in the dark and pillage right through
Don't let 'em take you like the buccaneers do
Right through the heart, they'll tear you in two
Then ride the vessel that they turn you into

[Hook]
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)
While you're burnin' away
The thing's goin' down
You gotta move, you gotta move (Yeah, ow)
