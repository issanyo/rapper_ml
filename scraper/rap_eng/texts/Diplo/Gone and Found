[Verse 1]
Hello, old ghost
What's the news? What's the news?
How I've longed to see your face again
Don't look at me like I'm a stranger
Don't be scared, there is no danger
We pretend that we don't care
So let's just take a walk and leave it there

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause sometimes things just don't turn out as you wished for
And that's what late night city lights are there for
You asked me back then what I wanted to do
But I didn't really know, did you?

[Chorus 1]
My mama said, "Someday, you are gonna shine"
(Don't know where I'm traveling to)
"You'll meet a guy who'll show you how love is kind"
(Don't know where I'm traveling to)
I'll run away and follow a strange old sign
(Dare no others to do)
Human I am, sorry I let you down
(I don't know where I'm traveling to)

[Verse 2]
What did you expect from these red lips?
Curses, laughter, and a tender kiss
Hours went by and you got it all
Empty walls in a hollow city hall
What was I to do but flee?
When all my thoughts lay far beyond the sea
(Let's go get lost)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And sometimes life just don't turn out as you wished for
And that's what late night city lights are there for
So let's go get lost, we're gonna go
What else to do, my old friend?

[Chorus 2]
My mama said, "You will be wise as time"
(Don't know where I'm traveling to)
"Teach you to ride on the wild horses of your own mind"
(Don't know where I'm traveling to)
Dimwitted man, human I am, slow down
(Dare no others to do)
Someday the wave's gonna show me the way to the sand
(I don't know where I'm traveling to)

[Bridge]
Let's go get lost
Let's go get lost
Let's go get lost

[Chorus 3]
My mama said, "Someday, you are gonna shine"
(Don't know where I'm traveling to)
"You'll be a woman, soft in your heart and kind"
(Don't know where I'm traveling to)
I'll run away and follow a strange old sign
(Dare no others to do)
Human I am, sorry I let you down
(I don't know where I'm traveling to)
I'll run away and follow a strange old sign
(Where I'm traveling to)
Human I am, bound to be gone and found
(Don't know where I'm traveling to)

[Outro]
(Dare no others to do)
(I don't know where I'm traveling to)
