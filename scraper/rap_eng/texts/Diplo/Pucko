[Verse 1]
I've met this Swedish girl
She had a milky white skin
She came down to Brazil
To sun bathe in beachy Rio
And as it is now
She's all chocolate brown

[Chorus]
Dont drop that pucko, menina
Dont drop that pucko
Dont drop that pucko, menina
Dont drop that pucko
Dont drop that pucko, menina
Dont drop that pucko

[Verse 2]
I have seen her walk change
And I do now confess
I like it better with her new flower print dress
She looks quite happy and shine
She doesn't mind the cheap wine
Because as it is now
She's all chocolate brown

[Chorus]
Dont drop that pucko, menina
Dont drop that pucko
Dont drop that pucko, menina
Dont drop that pucko
Dont drop that pucko, menina
Dont drop that pucko

[Verse 3]
When she gets back to Stockholm town
Everybody will go loco, loco, wow
Because the pucko girl is now cocoa brown
Man, will lose their breath and cry as she walks by
Because as it is now
She's all chocolate brown

[Chorus]
Dont drop that pucko, menina
Dont drop that pucko
Dont drop that pucko, menina
Dont drop that pucko
Dont drop that pucko, menina
Dont drop that pucko
