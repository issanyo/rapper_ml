[Verse 1]
Baby, don't deny it, you know you wanna dance!
(Baby, don't deny it, you know you wanna dance!)
The rhythm in our bodies is waiting for a chance!
(The rhythm in our bodies is waiting for a chance!)
Baby, don't deny it, you know you wanna dance!
(Baby, don't deny it, you know you wanna dance!)
The rhythm in our bodies is waiting for a chance!
(The rhythm in our bodies is waiting for a chance!)

[Verse 2]
Feliz quem pode ver
Feliz quem pode ter
Para a visão e o tato
O contato e o prazer
O seu corpo mulato
Nesse transparecer
Além de todo o nylon –
Você, você, você!
