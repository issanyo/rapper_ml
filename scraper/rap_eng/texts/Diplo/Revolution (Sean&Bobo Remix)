[Intro] (x2) :
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1] :
Can you see it?
The worst is over
The monsters in my head are scared of love
Fallen people listen up!
It's never too late to change our luck
So, don't let them steal your light
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Don't let them break your stride (Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh)
There's light on the other side
You'll see all the raindrops falling behind
It's a revolution
And we'll make it out tonight

It's a reva

[DROP]

Twerk it baby
(It's a reva)

[Bridge] (x2) :
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2 ] :
Can you see it?
The worst is over
The monsters in my head are scared of love
Fallen people listen up!
It's never too late to change our luck
So, don't let them steal your light
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Don't let them break your stride (Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh)
There's light on the other side
You'll see all the raindrops falling behind
It's a revolution
And we'll make it out tonight

It's a reva
