[Verse 1]
Two hearts, one past
I was your lover
Cruel words broke us
You became another

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm with the enemy in my bed
When the voice in my head
Tells me I should treat myself better
I know you don’t mean to be mean
When you’re hurting you'll see
You can see just how dark it is getting

[Chorus]
So one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
But one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry

[Verse 2]
Poor you, so sad
Well I think it's time now
You’re too crying feel so bad
But can I lie down

[Pre-Chorus]
The enemy in my bed
When the voice in my head
Tells me I should treat myself better
I know you don’t mean to be mean
When you’re hurting you'll see
You can see just how dark it is getting

[Chorus]
So one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
But one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry

[Bridge]
Feel my heart break
Feel my heart break
Feel my heart break
As I walk away (As I walk away)
Feel my heart break
Feel my heart break
Feel my heart break
As I walk away (As I walk away)

[Chorus]
So one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to fight
But one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry
It's your turn to fight
