[Verse 1: Vince]
My momma always told me women psycho
Bougie bitches paying school tuition for the lipo
She said she gone look better then Rihanna by the summer
ALC, them prices steep
This ain't the hundreds fuck you thinking
If I fuck her on the sink she gone be calling every week
I'ma fuck her on the sofa so she acting like she supposed to
Tesla Roadster in my dream, but this beamer get the job done
Money motivated, if it's slow then I'm gone rob some

[Verse 2: BIA]
Now if it's one thing I know, you either classy or trashy
I take a bite out the platter, but I ain't grow up with no daddy
I make 'em buy a g-wagon and a couple bundles of weed
But if it's two things I know, still ain't no nigga I need
I guess that's all on me, peanut butter seats with the top down
Nothing less than hated, he want a side piece like a ROD
By ROD I mean domesticated, so pardon my back
'Cause I ain't looking behind me
Soon as your ass big as Chyna
He'll go and leave you for Kylie

[Break: Vince]
My momma always told me women psycho (repeated 6x)
Psycho (repeated 14x)
