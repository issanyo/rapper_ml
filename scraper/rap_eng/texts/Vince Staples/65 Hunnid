[Hook]
Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)
Hard on a ho, drop your drawers to the floor
Gangsta God, baby get on yo knees (Baby girl get on yo knees)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid)

[Verse 1]
Runnin' to get to that check, I'm comin'
Jumpin' out of that back seat bustin'
Buss buss missions with the blower as a youngin'
Back when Killa Mo had em coppin' crystal through the prison do'
Feel the 4, when I'm feelin' low, time to stretch a nigga
Ridin through ya section, shit, I hope you got protection with ya
Hop out when the cops out, shit, I'm cold with mine
.45, brown rag, green light, Yoda time

[Hook]
Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)
Hard on a ho, drop your drawers to the floor
Gangsta God, baby get on yo knees (Baby girl get on yo knees)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid)

[Verse 2]
You alone, car full of niggas but you alone
It's time to show how much you love your homies
One nigga outside, two niggas up inside the store
One nigga gon' die, the other two can come along
Gloves with the disguise, bang the set before you blow
Don't stop 'til he drop, don't shoot for the skies or shoot for his toes
I told you before that niggas gotta die for this shit to survive
Is you with it or not? Get to knockin' then
Problem is lot of niggas scared of the consequence
Common sense missin' from your head when the pressure on
Niggas from my home ain't enrolled in the colleges
Fuck a class, junkies hittin' glass, get the money long
Gleamin' with the tints and the stash, no tags
Bumpin' poison on the ave, gettin' cash until a nigga's gone
And ain't shit wrong with the truth
Got the Juice, would've threw that nigga Bishop off the roof, ay!

[Hook]
Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)
Hard on a ho, drop your drawers to the floor
Gangsta God, baby get on yo knees (Baby girl get on yo knees)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid)
