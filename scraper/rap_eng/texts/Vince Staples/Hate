[Intro: SK Laflare]
Uh, and it's money, money, money, money
You already know
So much hate and confusion in the world
You gon' get it, keep pushing
Keep going
I'ma kill everything in sight, bitch

[Hook: SK Laflare]
Hating in the city, that's why you never see me
On cyber space, hating on the TV
Hating in these streets, I'm racing in that GT
Hating on these beats, you should play my CD
Real niggas show me love, bitches show me love
I got 'em rolling up and she wanna hold the gun
Niggas show me love, bitches show me love
I got 'em rolling up and she wanna hold the gun

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
On my momma cause I'm sick of all these pipe dream living, these niggas playing
Any day I could be locked up in prison, I need this paper
Fuck your prayers, they ain't calming me
I'm shooting til they call police
Don't got no dreams, I hardly sleep
We in these streets, we run these streets
Gangsta said we kill 'em them niggas soon as they fuck with me
Send 'em all to heaven, my momma gon' need the company
I promise once I die, ain't no living in the sky
Cause I'm sitting where they fry
Ask my momma, she know what I'm bout
Youngs come in, guns come out
Clips shoot ten rounds,  so that's ten men down
Niggas straight head shots, can't stop that shit
Kick a door down like his block ain't shit
Fuck fighting niggas, I promise y'all, we frying niggas
Swear that everybody dying nigga
Cut 'em with a casket

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SK Laflare]
What you know about it?
I'm so astounding
What these niggas doing, bringing hate around me
I'ma get to shooting [?]
You got the wrong reasons junior
It's more than just being [?]
[?] the truth is right here
I do with my music, it's quite clear
[?] in the night air
We coming, the moon is right there
[?] your life, yeah
We joined forces now they mourn for us
We ain't done working, we got 'em going nervous
They want more from us
Got demand for my grams
So I'm gonna serve 'em
I'm the man where I am
I'm doing what I got to do, gotta get it
Got the one, got the two
Got to get that triple digit
They gon' try to triple 6 us
[?]
God sent us in his early visit
Now you a witness to his wonders
The realest is in this
And we killing y'all niggas fronting
Killin' like it ain't nothing
