[Intro: Vince Staples & Santigold]
I got the power
I got the power
I got the power
I got the power, I came to let 'em know I got the power
I got the power, I came to let 'em know I got the power
I got the power, I came to let 'em know I got the power

[Verse 1: Santigold]
Oh my God, I hit you with my bass
I know you see me, tryna look the other way
All in a daze while you come up off the pavement
Out of control how I do it, handle business
All that happens so we all come to meet
One fall down, but together we are great
And now beware when we all stand tall
Breaking all that weapons, back you up on our wall

[Pre-Chorus: Santigold]
Now rockin' with 'em all day, mm
I got a plan for the world save, mm
And if you don't stay out my way
I put the fear in your heart

[Chorus: Santigold]
Give it all I got, and you know I got hard
You won't see me come, come up in your backyard
We takin' the world, better be on your guard
All stand down, all stand down, I got the power
Give it all I got, and you know I got hard
You won't see me come, come up in your backyard
We takin' the world, better be on your guard
Give it all I got, and you know I got hard
You won't see me come, come up in your backyard
We takin' the world, better be on your guard
All stand down, all stand down

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Life is like a motion picture going through the motions wit' ya
Life's too bright tell 'em fix the fixtures
I'm way too grown to be actin' ignant, I got the power
Scared to push it to the limit that's a damn shame
E'rbody trippin', she be getting with the campaign
Celebration bitches, tryna hit 'em with the champagne
Went hard, cash came, hit 'em with the flex
From school in detention droolin' on desks
To the man and the myth, I'm boomin' so 'pesc'
Don't you see it in my eyes? It'd be wise to respect that
Never give setback, baby, you can bet that
Let me get a head clap, let me get the front page
I heard once, the good die at a young age
Funny how I'm feelin' like I'm finna live forever
Though I got the power I came to let 'em know

[Outro: Vince Staples & Santigold]
I got the power
I got the power
I got the power
I got the power, I came to let 'em know I got the power
I got the power, I came to let 'em know I got the power
I got the power
I got the power
