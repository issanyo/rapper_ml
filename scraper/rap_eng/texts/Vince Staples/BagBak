[Verse 1]
This is for my future baby mama
Hope your skin is black as midnight
I'll take you out that Honda
I can put you in a Benz
I can balance out your chakras
Fornication is a sin, we can fuck all night regardless
Our father art in heaven, as I pray for new McLarens
Pray the police don't come blow me down 'cause of my complexion
Everybody think they know me now
Cause I'm chicken-checkin'
Negro, you are not my homie
How dare you think it's different
Boy, you trippin'

[Hook]
Gas break 'n dip, the cash came, I flipped
And stacked that, yeah I stacked that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for pictures, bagbak I'm trippin'
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me, homie

[Verse 2]
Boy I'm buoyant, we are
Floating on them peons
Go in 'til they take my bro'nem out them CDCRs
Prison system broken, racial war commotion
Until the president get ashy, Vincent won't be votin'
We need Tamikas and Shaniquas in that Oval Office
Obama ain't enough for me, we only getting started
The next Bill Gates can be on Section 8 up in the projects
So 'til they love my dark skin
Bitch I'm goin' all in

[Hook]
Gas break 'n dip, the cash came, I flipped
And stacked that, yeah I stacked that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for pictures, bagbak I'm trippin'
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me, homie

[Interlude]
They found it
Depth close to 3,230 feet
A deep dive, but within acceptable range

[Verse 3]
Clap your hands if the police ever profiled
You ain't gotta worry, don't be scary 'cause we on now
Ain't no gentrifying us, we finna buy the whole town
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now, we on now
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the government to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the president to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now
We on now
We on now
We on now
