[Verse 1]
Clouds like steam and violence
With cold air, we're reminded
We're flying from the distant
Abyss, listen
You're a wonder of a dreamer
Awake the heavy sleeper
In the essence of blue and grey
Been longing for you to say
Back to reality
Let's research your anatomy
Engage me grammatically
And the reason I'm proud to be
In your phone, you text back to me
Flames to the sun
In a snow globe of creators
Where I found you're the one
Nah, no, scratch that
But you're the only one I call back
Laser tag, get zapped
But you're the only one I let grab
My flag, football
Time's up
Can't lose
You stay winning so true
In fact, I've said it for you
The scent of petals and mud
Will reach our airspace
Silence to be cut by what your eyes say
To which I play
A note from
The hot achy summer nights
You scratched my mosquito bites
I wish we could go back in time

[Hook]
Give you all my thoughts
But you wanted more
A drug to ride the highway
What for
Shout out your connect for me, for me
I'll say
Everything you want and more
A drug to ride the highway
What for
Shout out your connect for me, for me

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Aight, okay
These hoes know my preference
Order ostrich for the breakfast
Posh is posturepedics
But I'm with that extras like electives
I need my statue erected
I prolly have perfected my craft
Faster than anyone has
There's leather seats in the Jag
2003 on the tags
They pull me over, I laugh
Then pay the tickets in cash
They buy the tickets in advance
Cause I'm important, need the mansion in the forest
With the doorman and the butler wearing G unit, quick verse
I breeze through it, airing that gazebo ho
She like how we do it then I wanna meet that ho
If she gold digging, I'm digging that
She breathing where my dick is at
Feenin' off them triple stacks
Hit it her up
Yeah

[Hook]
