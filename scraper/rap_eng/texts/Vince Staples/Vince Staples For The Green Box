[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Soon going to hell and sooner going to jail
As soon as it's off the scale I'm sending it through the mail
I'm doing it by myself cause niggas are known to tell
And a closed mouth just get feds, 25 to life
Violent, white or mary-jane, to the pigs it's all the same
Slaughterhouse sitting on my waist let them get a taste
That P19 got springs like Gerald Green, shit
What more can I say? I load and I spray
You see it take a real man to shoot a soul in his face
And you know it come with a case
And maybe y'all not built like that
Cuz, pussy only get a pussy nigga side-tracked
I know these hoes will be hoes, the story has been told
Swear I'll shoot a nigga down if he play me on my paper chase
My patience thin trying to win in this amazing race
I die for money, I done seen my momma cry for money
Waking up at 6 just to wait for the WIC
But of course them motherfuckers wasn't paying the shit
Had too much to get help, but we was praying to live
So nigga blame it on self when I run in your crib
Black mask and a black mac and blame it on them
