[Intro]
All the time, all the time, all time
All the time, all the time, all time
Aight, you ready?

[Verse 1]
What do you believe in? Die to have respect
I believe that the world got black neglect
Living broke, liquor stores where we cashing checks
Flipping dope, pimping hoes just to make ends meet
County blues, counting days till you get set free
Broke the rules so they shoot now we R.I.P
Live and learn what you earn when you cross them streets
Caught a case cause he wouldn't catch a fade
Living pedal to the metal cause he couldn't catch a break
Couldn't see the stakes, couldn't see the trouble come his way
I'm still waiting for the day that we black and we proud
Till then we'll be shooting niggas down to the ground
Sing it loud

[Hook] x2
All the time, all the time, all time (all the time)
All the time, all the time, all time, boy
45 sitting side when I ride
If I ride for it, then I'll die for it

[Verse 2]
Fuck the world shit lately, black 380
Ready for wherever God gon' take me
On my momma I been out here since a young nigga
World tours and prison letters in my bunk, shit this life ain't yours
See, we fighting a chore rather, kill a nigga quick
Fuck the other side, show them niggas that you with the shit
Fucking homicide, let 'em see my ass upstate
Now they love to see me rattle sitting in that cage
Cause when some drugs get in the battle bet you lose all faith
I was born with a heart that the streets can't break
Never poured one shot, never rolled one J
Cause I don't need that shawty, point me to that bank
I ain't never had no money, nigga
Young and bummy so I had to be the funny nigga
Got a gun, started wilding like a dummy, nigga
I don't care about no murder just another nigga
Pull the fucking trigger

[Hook]
