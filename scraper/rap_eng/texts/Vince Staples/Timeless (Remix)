[Intro: James Blake]
Timeless, timeless
Timeless, timeless

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
How did the blood from out the...
How did the blood from out the...
How did the blood from out the...
How did the blood from out the...
How did the blood from out the sand, get in the hour glass?
The world was in my hands
I scorched the land then watch the hours pass
Then picked a couple flowers out the soil just to spoil you
Pricked my fingers on a few, had atleast a dozen grown
Remind me of the shells that which I'm walking on
You catch my drift
Oceans wasn't made for Vince, motions leave me more than sick
Couldn't ride the love boat, jumped into the lone abyss
Rather be alone than build unhappy homes
Now I'm gone
Down with Davy Jones where it's dark at day and night
Way beneath the ocean breeze
You lose your sight then lose yo knees
I was fortunate to meet you, wasn't strong enough to keep you
But I never let a person breathing bring me to my knees
That's why Jesus had to die, that's why Lennon had to leave
So I hope I live forever when I fall beneath the sea
Did it all for you and me, the eulogy won't be too bright
Apologies go to the pastor in advance
The sweet disaster of our dances, history of our ancestors
Everybody got a master
I'm a slave to the rhythm moonwalking through the night
So I refuse, I refuse, and I know we live an illusion
I know we born to be losers, you lose yo love then lose yo life
And then the numbers get fewer
Until the sun shine bright, until the last page turn
That's if the fire in your eyes don't leave the books all burned
I tried to read between the lines without my glasses
Girl I'm blind, I guess we got some shit in common
After all (timeless)
You see the signs, you signed a letter left it on my dresser, left my ass behind
I guess the moments that we shared was just a way of buying time, timeless
