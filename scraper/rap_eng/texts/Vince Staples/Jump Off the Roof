[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
What's your addiction baby?
Love can make a bitch go crazy
Kiss, hug, fuck and then get faded
Fall out and it's all out war
Head twirl and your vision blurry
Dopeman in that kitchen stirrin'
Sold it, we so lit, dope burners
Fuck is you so forgetful for?
Girl you know that you need that raw
Girl you know that you need Visine
Preem laced with that coca√≠n
Pop a pill, pop what's in them jeans
Cop a feel, cop a half sixteen
Pour a deuce up and then start leanin'
Tryin' to die higher than Pimp C
And Big Moe, you know how the shit go
(You know how the shit go)

[Hook: Vince Staples]
I pray to God cause I need him, I need him, I need him
Cocaine withdrawals and I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin'
Life way too hard, am I dreamin'? I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin'
Highway to hell and I'm speedin', one way to tell if I'm breathin'
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Baby girl love me, I love ya back
Just don't turn ya back on me
Though I'm borderline crazy, mama crack baby
Seizures come when I sleep
So just hold my hand darlin', don't wanna be
A part of your problem, just wanna sleep
Without my lungs stopping like they used to
I hate when you lie, I hate the truth too
Can't wait 'til you die, I hate that we through
Fuck around and get a man, leave him dead where he stand
With the blam', I ain't playin' with a mufucka
I was raised at the end of the land
With the surf and the sand, get a tan in this mufucka
Wanna feel how you feel, if it's mine, then it's real
Then it's fine baby girl, I don't need a rubber
Nothing wrong in the world with another mother
(You know how the shit go)

[Hook: Vince Staples]
I pray to God cause I need him, I need him, I need him
Cocaine withdrawals and I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin'
Life way too hard, am I dreamin'? I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin'
Highway to hell and I'm speedin', one way to tell if I'm breathin'
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof

[Bridge: Snoh Aalegra & (Vince Staples)]
If I told you, that I love you, would you care?
If I said I need you would you be right there
If I told you, that I love you, would you care?
If I said I need you would you be right there
Be right there... (You know how the shit go)

[Hook: Vince Staples]
I pray to God cause I need him, I need him, I need him
Cocaine withdrawals and I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin'
Life way too hard, am I dreamin'? I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin'
Highway to hell and I'm speedin', one way to tell if I'm breathin'
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
