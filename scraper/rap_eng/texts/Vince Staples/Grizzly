[Intro: Vince Staples]
Don't want the dun
Don't want the dun
Don't want the dun
Don't want the dun
Don't want the dun
Don't want the dun

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
When you wake up in the morning, what's the first thing you see?
I see regret in that rectangle sitting over the sink
If karma real, I hope it recognize remorse when we meet
And understand that ain't a lot of shit important to me
It's funny how a nigga life can leave his frame from a squeeze
See I done brightened many nights all in the name of the team
Have his mom up in memorial, praying for Jesus
Pair of pistols turn a pussy into a paraplegic
That's what all that woofin' get you, make you grieve for your grievance
Granted, I'm greedy, take a nigga life like I need it
Leave him in pieces, peace was never part of the plan
Revolver stronger than that stick that nigga parted the sea with
That's the price to pay nowadays, born in this shit
Hard to overcome what's stolen then imported on the ship
Niggas dying young, it seems as if the cycle repeats
I set my own path, nigga you should follow my lead
Lead, lead, lead, nigga listen to me

[Verse 2: Clayton Samus]
Nickel and diming just to pass the time
The blackintosh been on my mind with a Cuban bitch
Maybe Diablo got my interest
I keep my options open thanks to new Jamieson on my sinning lips
For now I got that Acura, matching my intermission
The [?] with the green, probably got it for cheap
Bagged a Velociraptor quicker than my baby fleece
Simply ape shit, forget the piece and that's a [?] three
I'm in the back of a Civic like, "bitch, come lock your door"
Thanks for the booty [?] on my chocolate [?]
Just count the work for what it's worth and back to flossin'
Regardless, I can't stay hurt, [?] covers where my pocket's sore
The [?] I can never regret it
A humble victory and never can accept all the sin and defeat
He'll probably question all the proverbs my pastor preach
Look at myself in disbelief, saying life ain't sweet
