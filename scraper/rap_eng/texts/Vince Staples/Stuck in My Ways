[Verse 1]
I wanna ask God why the Bible lied to me
Just full of politics, leaving niggas without a sin
Now is it false prophets who forged the religious documents?
I done spent my whole life sinning without a consequence
Momma trying to figure what the fuck my problem is
And why I gotta live this way, I know my path ain't straight
But in the field, don't nothing but grit matter
Just get it how you live and figure the shit after
Nigga, gotta get it before I die out here
Don't wanna see my mama cry out tears, sitting below the earth
Cause Heaven's out of the question, but for what it's worth
We made the most out of the nothing they give us
Heart was frigid but both these boulders sit on my shoulder
I try to figure my motive for leaving niggas behind
But if my fate is defied, hope whatever messiah that sent me there
Knew he only did this shit for survival

[Hook]
I'm so stuck in my ways
The love and the hate was both shoved in my face
Gotta stay on your toes, head starts in the race
Just wasn't given to those who came up where I stay
Ya name up in the game, but start watching ya back
These hoes want what you got, trying to plot on your stacks
Still the plot thickens
Yeah, they better hope God with 'em

[Verse 2]
Is black pride still alive, or was niggas trippin?
Cause last time I checked, we lost self respect
And some didn't admit it cause mama was with the business
And daddy was trying to fuck, he left, that's just his luck
Suppressed, nothing but anger inside that chamber
Aim from the other side so we hate him, no need explaining
Baby momma drama cause karma being a hater
Now it's lookin' like abortion, your momma doing the favor
Black Buick Le Sabre, creeping down the street
No tags on the whip so you sneakin' past police
25, two strikes, you don't need a number three
They pull you over, now you nervous 'cos the heater by the seat

[Hook]
