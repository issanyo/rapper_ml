Well would you look at this
This hand is dealt in your favor
Don't let it slip

There ain’t another
Don't you wish
You had another round
To go at it?

Oh you just keep leading it on
Like I'm one of your toys
Can’t help but play with your choice

Oh you just keep leading it on
Like its something to ignore
Death and taxes and war

Times when i eye you
You wanna run away
Princess, you with this?
Not begging you to stay
‘cause if you're blind i can't
Make a nigga see
Not 'bout to convince you
Come with me

Oh you just keep leading it on
Like I'm one of your toys
Can't help but play with your choice

Oh you just keep leading it on
Like its something to ignore
Death and taxes and war

Don't let them
Skate by you
Their hem all in the breeze
Heads full of wildness
End falling to their knees
But if you're blind
Can’t make em see
I cannot convince
But I know, I know

Na na na na na na na na

Oh you just keep leading it on
Like I’m one of your toys
Can't help but play with your choice

Oh you just keep leading it on
Like its something to ignore
Death and taxes and war
