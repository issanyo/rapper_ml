[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Hip hop ain't really did shit for me
Little bit of hell, little bail for the homies
Got a little green, bought a beam for the forty
Took more shots after fades than Kobe
After dark you go crazy
Police ain't scarin' shit, you ain't bred for this
I'm still in the hood, they make bread and dip
I'm not jumpin' ship, I might fuck your bitch
Who got love for Vince?
Feelin' like Snoop at the Source awards
Feelin' like you wasn't born for war
Cause when I come around you be heir to the ground
Crack a motherfuckin' smile, I'm the man 'round the town
Frank Lucas mode
When out here ma heard that Frank Lucas told
Long Beach like Crazy Joe with Mayhem
Where we get new wheels from rocks like caveman

[Hook]
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Uh)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Yo)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Uh)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Yo)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Uh)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Yo)
Might dump a clip, where them niggas at? (Uh)
Might fuck your bitch, where the women at?

[Verse 2]
Crack baby base in my Similac
Been crazy, come where you livin' at
Kick down the door, get down or get gone
I ain't come here for the chitter-chat
But I'm far removed from that gangsta shit
It don't make much sense, rather make me rich
Don't be playin' with my money, it'll make the flip
And in the last couple lines I'ma contradict
And for the last time, I ain't on my conscious shit
I like big guns, fast whips, ass and tits
Mansions and white women, Mike Jackson shit
So stop actin' like I'm an activist
No, this ain't happen on accident
They giving dead white men to the Africans
It'll never be another one after this
So just pay admission and pay attention

[Hook]
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Uh)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Yo)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Uh)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Yo)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Uh)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Yo)
Might dump a clip, where them niggas at? (Uh)
Might fuck your bitch, where the women at?
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Uh)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Yo)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Uh)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Yo)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Uh)
Little bit of this, little bit of that (Yo)
Might dump a clip, where them niggas at? (Uh)
Might fuck your bitch, where the women at?
