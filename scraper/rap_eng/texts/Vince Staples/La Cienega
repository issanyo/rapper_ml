[Verse 1: RetcH]
Up on these herbs, fuck with these birds
For my dead homies, pour some on the curb
Head to the strip just to see whats the word
Ran in the store for some dutches and nerds
Last few nights, shit was absurd
Had sex with a white bitch in a jacuzzi
She ain't even knew me, but she fucked me like she knew me
[?]
I'm a wild boy, been 7:30 for a while boy
Used to trap X to them white boys
And the only thing I fear is them lights boy
Cause I trap so hard that their tryna find me
Ride around my dolo, I don't need a Bonnie
Ranchers in my Sprite got me feeling jolly
Only wore a mink cause them hoes on Molly
Yeah they feeling me dog, booty so fat that it's killing me dog
Get 'em to the crib and I get in them draws
I been blowing on dope and she blowing my balls, like
Yeah suck that, suck that like you love that
Fuck that bitch for a half and hour then I'm rolling up that dub sack
Fuck laying with a dip cause I'm finna hit the strip
Tell a bitch I'ma hit her cellular
And my taillight out, so I'm taking back routes
Nigga I ain't tryna see them Federals
Just walk up in the store, oh yeah for sure
Two for one swishers at the register
Now I'm posted in front that 7/11
Smoking weed out on La Cienega

[Hook]
I'm riding low, I'm bumping Frankie Beverly
Cruising through LA, I'm swerving through the streets of Beverley
With my white broad and she rolling up that celery
Just was in the hood so it ain't shit that you telling me
So every time you see me I be cheesing hard
Smoking killer weed right up out the fucking jar
I ain't shit but these hoes think that I'm a star
Catch a nigga on La Cienega Boulevard

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Phantom OG in my swisher sweet
Finna write a opera on this beat
I run into the bitch of your dreams
And we fuck in the same night we meet
She kinda famous so we real discreet
Suck me 'til I fall asleep
They say I'm chasing death just like it owe me money
Sipping prometh' like my nose is runny
But the codeine in it, so you know I'm numb b
I threw the maggie on before I jump up in the 'tollah I'ma come clean
I can't control it, lost the remote
Lenses on focus from this potent
Woke up and went in like the door was open, Newport smoking
She strolling through my crib with my hoodie on
Do my living by the minute next second it could be gone
You looking at Tommy Buns in the flesh and blood
The only thing that's on my mind is this money, sex, and drugs
Sitting at the top, you motherfuckers can't stand next to us
Kick you off the top of Everest, H'z, hoe

[Hook]
I'm riding low, I'm bumping Frankie Beverly
Cruising through LA, I'm swerving through the streets of Beverley
With my white broad and she rolling up that celery
Just was in the hood so it ain't shit that you telling me
So every time you see me I be cheesing hard
Smoking killer weed right up out the fucking jar
I ain't shit but these hoes think that I'm a star
Catch a nigga on La Cienega Boulevard

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Nigga name your mission, I'm tryna make a million
Pray to Muhammad this Molly move 'fore my momma get here
Pedal to the metal swerving serving niggas rego'
Tryna make my mission 'fore I'm murdered in the ghetto
Northside LB, niggas can't tell me nothing
I hope the scales be tipping in my favor
When it's time to meet my maker, I know I made a lot of mistakes
But for this paper I'll do whatever it takes, I'm starving nigga
Hold up if it's 6 in the 7
It only take 1 shot to send a nigga to Heaven
3 to that niggas direction, know where I come from
The question is where the fuck am I headed
See that snubnose home made, WorldStar homepage
9 times out of the 10 them niggas gon' bang
Black .45 inside [?] the coldchain
Bullets hit his whole frame, he screaming leave my brain alone

[Hook]
I'm riding low, I'm bumping Frankie Beverly
