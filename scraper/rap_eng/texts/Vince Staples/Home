[Verse 1]
This morning I woke up in a fortress of distortion
I'm at war with my emotions, I'm at war with they enforcement
Tryna fight for what's right and got sidetracked
Where your mind at? Never mind that
Can we think in a blink, you swimmin', you sinkin'
You win, you leavin' a head where I've loaded my weapon
I stay with my brethren, I pay for protection
My prey in my sight so I'm doing what's right and not askin' no questions
I wanna be home free, where's one that was lonely?
But I'm ready and waitin'
For my day of salvation, and I'm patient

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I’m coming home now
I’m coming home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Right where I belong now
Right where I belong

[Verse 2]
They're looking for saviors, I'm looking for safety
They never gon' break me, take me
Down on my knees, believe I'm never gon' beg or plead
Yeah, I never say never, but I guarantee
Gather my strength, goin' hard in the paint
Paint you a picture, it's put on display
I'm gonna get, they don't give then I take
Can't take me down now
My feet on the ground now
Fight 'til I'm down now
Say it out loud now
Say it out loud, are you ready for war?

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I’m coming home now
I’m coming home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Right where I belong now
Right where I belong

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
