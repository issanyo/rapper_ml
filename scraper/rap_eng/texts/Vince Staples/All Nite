[Verse 1]
Woke up in another man's main bitch
Phone jumpin' out the gym, finna gang slide
To the Norf side, every day, same shit
Tryna make wreck, and the world mine
Long Beach on the map cause the cold chain
Back like the city never left, it's a strong reign
Bangin' when the only niggas boomin' was the cold flamez
Funny I'm the only nigga with a known name
Heard they really wanna gun me down
Good luck with that
Still gon' slide in the same ride 'round my town
Still got that MAC
That lil' bitch with the shit wanna get buss down
Might fuck with that

[Hook]
I'm anybody killer
Your baby mama, anybody's nigga
And we be sayin'
All gas, no brakes, might break your face
Get hit on sight, on sight
Ain't gotta prove this shit
We do this shit all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night, all night

[Verse 2]
Raise it up, 6-4 still tippin'
That angel dust that had K. Dot trippin'
In my pop's grape Swisher when he roll up
Wig a nigga when he roll up
Where you from? So what?
This a cold game and my domain post up
Get a close up, hit the pen, prolly roll up
That's a no no in the Norf Norf
You are not welcome
Black tee, got the .44, don't test him
Body EC when he prolly squeeze
You already know a nigga rockin' off of Poppy Street
I'll block a man like La Flame
Better bite the bullet 'fore the bullet fight your brain
Big burner in the whip, no license, swangin'
Ike Turner on a bitch, hoes love the gamin'

[Hook]
I'm anybody killer
Your baby mama, anybody's nigga
And we be sayin'
All gas, no brakes, might break your face
Get hit on sight, on sight
Ain't gotta prove this shit
We do this shit all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night, all night

[Bridge]
Shoot fire, on sight, that's mando
Shoot fire, on sight, that's mando
Good night, now light them candles
Good night, now light them candles
My people ready to go
My people ready to go
I'm out my mind
I'm out my mind
I'm out my mind
I'm out my mind
Short fuse, no lose, big gamble
Short fuse, no lose, big gamble
It's flyin' out that barrel
It's flyin' out that barrel
My people ready for war
My people ready for war
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time

[Hook]
All gas, no brakes, might break your face
Get hit on sight, on sight
Ain't gotta prove this shit
We do this shit all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night, all night
