[Verse 1]
I remember when I first saw "Fade to Black"
I told my grandma I'd get a chain just like that
She asked me was I trying to rap, not fucking with that
Just trying trap bricks, and stack chips
Cus that gold look good with a 'Lac tint
In the front seat sitting with a Mac-10
Just skating, Rory Fitzpatrick
Dope mathematics is all a nigga know
In it for the show, yeah the money and the hoes
All I ever want
Posted in the hood, shit I probably never go
Nigga run his mouth, then we throw him in the trunk
Bet his Mama never see him again, cus we in this to win
Not repented for sin, just replenish you ends
When it's time to fuck with Heaven, I'll just pay to get in
Spend the rest on a Benz, 5% on the tints

[Hook]
If I had all the money in the world, the money in the world
The clothes, the cars, the girls

[Verse 2]
Maserati Ricky, East side king with a semi
Pinstripe Dell Curry jersey's lighting 30's
Block hot so we stocking chickens in the churches
Sell em after service, bitch I service the community wales
Old dude said I'm going to hell, nah I'm going to wales
Turn the castle into a crack house
Bitches with they back's out, trying bring they ass out
Hoping that the seed sprout, soon we'll check
See that fast life's cool till it all boils over
Bulletproof Rovers and two-faced chauffeurs
Won't save shit from a loud gun rip
When friends turn to foes on some come up shit
Most niggas die tryna live that life
But you never get to live that twice
So cock that, right?

[Hook]
