[Verse 1]
No, I'm running, running, running
Against the time I'm always
Running at 100, goin' out of my mind
And I have visions, I see rivers flowin'
Up in the sky, oh I know people keep on
Coming, come into the light

[Bridge]
Oh, I keep bein' animal heart
And I keep on a-movin' along
Cuz I know, I know where I'm going
Oh, I know, I know what I want
I been holding on for so long
I said no, don't leave me, don't go
Oh, I know, I know where I'm going
Oh, I keep on keep it on my love

[Chorus]
We are, we are, we are all fighting for the flames
The fire lights the black night like candles in the rain

[Verse]
Keep my head, keep my head on tight
Keep my hand on my money, right
I believe, you know I do
Oh, I know, I know, I know it's true

[Bridge]
Oh, I keep bein' animal heart
And I keep on a-movin' along
Cuz I know, I know where I'm going
Oh, I know, I know what I want
I been holding on for so long
I said no, don't leave me, don't go
Oh, I know I know where I'm going
Oh, I keep on keep it on my love

[Chorus]
We are, we are we are all fire for the flames
The fire lights the black night like candles in the rain

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Screamin' fuck the world, got a baby momma now
It's drama every time you turn, turnin' up the volume
Tryna drown the sound of mother nature drowning in the vine
I put you on a level where you had to heard it from a partner
Was a wise man, told me have yo heart and neva let it hurt you
Mind playin', learn to mind yo business
I just met a holy guy here walkin' through the blizzard
Till the sun comes shining peeking through the blinds
So we snap too blinding, living in the lying to you
Living in the sky, that's the bed you provided
Know they had a lot, they ain't picking up the proud
Whachya puttin' on the line? whachya doin' till you die?

[Bridge]
Oh, I keep bein' animal heart
And I keep on a-movin' along
Cuz I know, I know where I'm going
Oh, I know, I know what I want
I been holding on for so long
I said no, don't leave me, don't go
Oh, I know I know where I'm going
Oh, I keep on keep it on my love

[Chorus]
We are, we are we are all fire for the flames
The fire lights the black night like candles in the rain
