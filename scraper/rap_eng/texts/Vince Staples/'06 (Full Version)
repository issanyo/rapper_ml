[Chorus]
Good mornin', hope you had a good time last night
I need money from e'rybody, mo'fucker, better pay your tithes
Now I can change your life, fuck what's wrong, fuck what's right
What you want? What you like? Your world been mine

[Verse 1]
There's niggas gettin' paid over there
And niggas got it made over there
I'm finna bring the gang in the gauge over there
I'm down for the front page rage, I swear
Nigga who are you? Another fuckin' monkey in the zoo
It's junkies in the alleys, gunners on the loose
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
With a ten shot tec, I'm as bad as it get

[Chorus]
Good mornin', hope you had a good time last night
I need money from e'rybody, mo'fucker, better pay your tithes
Now I can change your life, fuck what's wrong, fuck what's right
What you want? What you like? Your world been mine

[Verse 2]
I'm black and I'm proud, you mad and you broke
I'm shootin' at a crowd for booin' at a show
The Crips and the Bloods, the new Jim Crow
The guns and the drugs, the new noose rope
Just hang with a nigga, the hood last hope
Everybody fulla shit, chasin' bitches or hits
I'm as real as niggas get, get a grip mo'fucker
Keeper of my brother man, real street runner mane

[Chorus]
Good mornin', hope you had a good time last night
I need money from e'rybody, mo'fucker, better pay your tithes
Now I can change your life, fuck what's wrong, fuck what's right
What you want? What you like? Your world been mine
