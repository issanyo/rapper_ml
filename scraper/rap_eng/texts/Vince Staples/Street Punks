[Verse 1]
I ain't worried about the police
I ain't worried about these lil niggas talking about they hold heat
I ain't stressing going broke
I don't never leave the residence alone, keep it on me
I'm the nigga that you quote
I'm the only conversation if you speaking up on Long Beach
Get to acting like you know
Don't be acting like you bold, get it cracking at a show
Heard the Feds taking pictures, let a motherfucker pose
Tryna be the only Crippin' nigga sitting in the Vogue
Better put me on the cover, undercovers at my home
Tryna catch a nigga slippin', but I'm stickin' to the flow
Heard these niggas flippin' coke, why the fuck these niggas broke?
If it's shooters in the squad, what's the bodyguard for?
You ain't calling me collect then I ain't pickin' up the phone
Got some homies from the set who ain't never comin' home
You wouldn't know about it

[Hook]
You a street punk
You a muthafuckin' street punk
No one know about you
You a street punk
You a muthafuckin' street punk
Get some dough up out you
Where the cash at, where the cash at?
Where ya pass at, where ya stash at?
Bet my last rack, you ain't have that
Why? Cause you a muthafuckin' street punk!

[Verse 2]
I don't know if ya heard of me
But you heard them shots on the block, it's a murder scene
Go on, call the cops, open heart, durin' surgery
Now his breathin stopped, stupid niggas shoulda knew we trippin
Now he in a box, Winchester's, hundred in the box, Smith Wesson
Stuff it to the top and we coming to your spot
Knocking on the door, askin' where he at
Playin' games then we kick it down, everybody flat
On the ground, kids get kidnapped, go and ask 'bout it
Well you know how we rockin, nigga
You know who we whackin' now
You ain't never caught a body, know it cause you talkin' 'bout it
Catch me off of Coronado
You a motherfucking street punk

[Hook]
You a street punk
You a muthafuckin' street punk
No one know about you
You a street punk
You a muthafuckin' street punk
Get some dough up out you
Where the cash at, where the cash at?
Where ya pass at, where ya stash at?
Bet my last rack you ain't have that
Why? Cause you a muthafuckin' street punk!
