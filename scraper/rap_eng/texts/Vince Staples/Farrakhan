[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Read up on ISIS the other day
Bred up on violence, my phone on silent
Can't call my bluff or anybody, k?
Anybody get touched any kind of way
Anyway, read up on ISIS they trippin'
I ain't worried about it I'm crippin'
All my automatics extended
Don't be coming around with that come around
Kill everybody, no witness
Bandana brown like my pigment
Yeah my alma mater like Bunchy Carter
I gun 'em down, I gun 'em down
I'm black, proud, and my mac loud
Five powers to the people
Walk up get down through the peephole
Cold game, cold case, nigga eat chrome
Coldchain

[Verse 2: Joey Fatts]
Feeling godbody when I'm walking around here with that shotty
I don't need a chronic, you gonna get that business if you try me
Bitch I'm radical, yeah, I'm radical, the automatics blow
Since the Reagan era niggas serve and front that Texaco
They hate what they can't control, we don't fuck with no patrol
Take it back to fifty-four, boy I'm sticking to them codes
My fist high, my clique ready
Hood look like Katrina when they broke the levees
My gun cocked, my hand steady
Arm out the window in a black Chevy, uh!
