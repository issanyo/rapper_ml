[Hook: James Fauntleroy & Cocaine 80s]
We might be wrong, might be guilty
We might be right this time
You tried to warn me, this war that would kill me
I sacrificed
Die to the world, I took the money
(Wouldn't you)
So for my life
Can't sleep at night, you shoulda seen the crib though
So fucking nice

[Interlude 1: Haneef Talib]
Speaking on the unjust way the justice system is justifying crimes against our kind
Justice is supposed to be blind
But continue to cross color lines
Hands up, don't shoot
Shot. Stand your ground
Blacks don't own no ground to stand on so we stand on our words.
Black and hooded is the official probable cause for cops to keep weapons on
I can't breathe through the chokeholds and gun smoke
These realities drift and appear to inform black boys and men of the dangers outside their doors
Slain in society by sworn protectors
Protected by their peers, grand juries full of friends
No charges brought against them
They kill and arrest us, transgress and oppress us. Damn, cuz

It don't even matter. You can start from the beginning...

[Interlude 2: Haneef Talib]
They searching, they searching cells
Hold on cuz, (Oh it's the) there's police in this motherfucker, you ain't hear them?
You ain't hear the alarms?
Three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine... ten, eleven
Another day in Ironwood
