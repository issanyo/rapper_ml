[Hook: Joey Fatts]
Chopper shells around your neck, all my niggas cutthroat
Let my burner do the talking, all these pistols ain't for show
If my nigga got a problem, then my nigga it's a go
Niggas known to catch a body when they hear them semi's blow
Chopper shells around your neck, all my niggas cutthroat
Let my burner do the talking, all these pistols ain't for show
If my nigga got a problem, then my nigga it's a go
Niggas known to catch a body when they hear them semi's blow

[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
Creeping down the one way hammered up
Leave a nigga holey on a Sunday
Little homie thirteen, snorting coke, serving 'yay
Trap that white girl, so you know he keep that Mary K, let it spray
Where a nigga stand he will lay, hit him up proper
Give his ass a chopper to the face, then get out of state
Niggas bring the drama where you stay
Hit your old head and pop his ho head and burn the place, fucking jake's
Got a chrome MAC-11, down for a two-eleven
If you preaching like a reverend, turn it one eighty-seven
Joey in the trap, always posted with a strap
Don't compare me to these niggas, I'm a gangster that rap
Bitch

Chopper shells around your neck, all my niggas cutthroat

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Any nigga with a problem get his top chopped off
We where the cops don't come, me and Mossberg moss
Fully on it, loaded, selling pints of lean and pounds of marijuana
Move that methadone ya' till it got a little slower
Bend the one's cause I be selling drugs cuz'
If you need the buzz, needa' hit a nigga up cuz'
Tryna' hit a lick, then you got the whole game fucked up cuz'
Compact forty, niggas gon' get touched cuz'
It's no game when you dealing with coldchain
Still a paid ass criminal dealing that Lo Mein
No chicken or chopstick, just Civic's and chop bricks
My nigga I got shit, and it's still free Smalls

Chopper shells around your neck, all my niggas cutthroat
Let my burner do the talking, all these pistols ain't for show
If my nigga got a problem, then my nigga it's a go
