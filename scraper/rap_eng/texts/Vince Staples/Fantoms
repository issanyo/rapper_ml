[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Understand me nigga, Don’t need no Grammys
Give us the money you got in your pockets, I feel like taxing nigga
Bout the action, give me a reason, I’ll gladly get it knockin’
Chunky nine right by my side look like a midget walkin’
Watch the shit that you talkin’, promise its with me often
I got to stop with the trigger talkin’, I promised mama
But I’m rapping my life, I load automatics at night
Ops don’t come to the Pop, they know they gettin’ dropped
I getting on ‘cause I be getting off, in my lane
You getting’ no luck, get a job
I should throw my shows at synagogues
Mention me when you mention God
But fuck it, I’m just talkin’ shit to y’all

[Hook: Joey Fatts]
Young and gunnin’, niggas stay drummin’
Big tools in your house, say we here for the plumbing
Niggas say they with it, but them boys frontin'
Choppin’ shots with your block, fuck niggas say somethin’
Fuck niggas say somethin’, fuck niggas say somethin’
Niggas stay drummin, choppin’ shots with your block
Fuck niggas say somethin’

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Chop a choppa down, they told me never run
Unless you hear them copper sounds, I got them copper rounds
Gunnin' for them gold plaques
A 2014 Benz with the low jack, Pirellis's and the pistol stack
Riding down Obispo Ave, thinkin' bout the bus days
Never goin' back to that, checks be coming back-to-back
Put you on the front page, have the homeys handle that
Pro club hoodie, straps, socks with the sandals wrapped
Long beach legend, Jordan kick me out
If you from the city, that should tell you what I'm really bout
Give 'em class to get the cash, run your mouth, I'll kick your ass
But I'm just talkin' shit again

[Hook]
