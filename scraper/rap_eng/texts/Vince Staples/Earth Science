[Verse 1]
Bitches born with shovels
Guess that devil in disguise make you more than a woman
Felt the anger in your eyes since the moment I hugged you
Seemed familiar like a look in the mirror
You took a chance and I appreciate it
Understand that over time our word depreciated
But we can do it all again, waiting for you to say when
Give it time and a place swear to god I'll attend
I should've took you to prom
Fuck whoever had did but I was busy punching niggas in the face by the gym
And you was right there, you was always right there
Forwarding your calls thinking how we got here

[Chorus]
But I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
No, I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you

[Verse 2]
Remember walking to your house everyday of the week
Nothing else I had to do and you was something to see
Red rose tattooed right up under your jeans
Still text you every night before I wander to sleep
Never told you this but you was why I went to seventh period
Truant student but you told me I should take it serious
Losing you is just another demon that I'm living with
Standing in your living room meeting your fam'
Know it hurt you when they ask you what had happen to him
When you see me on the t.v. know I'm glad you're my friend
Wish I had more but I don't
Never running out of hope really I'm just waiting on you

[Chorus]
But I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
No, I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you

[Verse 3]
As for you I always think about our kids that you killed
Understanding at the time you didn't think we was real
But as a man I feel I let you down, we was on our second child
That you seen as a mistake before I got to reconcile
It make you see the way I try to plan for us all
When I look back at my life I'm glad I had you involved
If I ever need somebody you the first imma call
Said that you would do it all just to see me alive
In the back seat, steel beats, tears in your eyes
Told me they was tears of joy, still I think that's a lie
But whatever help you walk in faith, you couldn't when you walked away
Sorry if you called me and I tell you I can't talk today
Pain in my voice when I speak in these songs
Same tone as the day I told you leave me alone

[Chorus]
But I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
No, I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said
