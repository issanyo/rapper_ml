[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
Detonate, detonator
Baby, oh, you blow my mind
You tell me wait, wait on ya
But baby, I can't wait all night
I go through pictures you send my phone
Oh, stop tempting me
You know what I want
I wanna make, wanna make love
Girl, I can't lie

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
So here we go, go again
It's like I'm caught under your spell
You're wearing black, black magic
Well baby, don't wear nothing else
Open up this door, don't you play
Ain't no other man gon' make you feel the same
I wanna make, wanna make love
Girl, I can't lie

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer
So...

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Smile when you're talking to me
I don't wanna know your real pain
Long nights, I don't know your real name
Soft kiss when the yellow cab came
Til the next time when the sun fall
And my thoughts roam and the love calls
For your soft tone and your sweet talk
And your dial tone when you're not bothered
Hoping feelings never get brought up
Conversation never get broad
Still blind by the street lights
Never gonna let another man cross
Yes, I understand
Baby, loosen up your pants
Staring at me from your knees
Birds and the fucking bees

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer
