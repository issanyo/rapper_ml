[Gunshot]

[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm a mufuckin' legend
I'm a mufuckin' legend
And this how a nigga feel
And this how a nigga feel
I'm a mufuckin'

[Hook: Vince Staples (Earl Sweatshirt)]
One hand in the air, two hands on the nine when you shoot (I'm a mufuckin' legend)
When I die build a shrine on my side of the town if it's cool
It's so hard, tryin' not to go so hard
It's so hard, tryin' not to go so hard

[Break: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm a mufuckin' legend, I'm a mufuckin' legend, I'm a mufuckin' legend

[Hook: Vince Staples (Earl Sweatshirt)]
One hand in the air, two hands on the nine when you shoot
When I die build a shrine on my side of the town if it's cool
It's so hard, tryin' not to go so hard
It's so hard, tryin' not to go so hard
(I'm a mufuckin')
(I'm a mufuckin')
