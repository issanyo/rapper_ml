[Chorus]
I'm in that 745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy sure you right"
745
745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked me in my eyes and told me "Daddy sure you right"
745

[Verse 1]
All my life man I want fast cars, NASCARs
All my life I want runway stars, Kate Moss
All my life I want waves at my front door
No green grass, no porch
I just want sea shores
All my life
All my life pretty women done told me lies
All my life pretty women done told me lies
All my life pretty women done told me lies
Told me lies, told me lies

[Chorus]
I'm in that 745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy show you right"
745
745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked me in my eyes and told me "Daddy show you right"
745

[Verse 2]
Eyes can't hide your hate for me
Maybe you was made for the Maybelline
Spent so much tryna park the car
Barely got a tip for the ma√Ætre d'
You head straight to the oyster bar
I tread light each time we speak
Play too rough might break ya heart
And them glass shoes ain't made to walk
These lonely streets
Unpaved, unscathed
Morning dew's giving you the coldest feet
Said that you was comin' through after dark
To look at the stars and hardly speak
This thing called love real hard for me
This thing called love is a God to me
And we all just God's property
So feel free to fulfill the prophecy

[Bridge]
Adam, Eve
Apple trees
Watch out for the snakes baby
Open streets
Ocean breeze
We should get away, baby

[Chorus]
I'm in that 745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy show you right"
745
745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked me in my eyes and told me "Daddy show you right"
745
