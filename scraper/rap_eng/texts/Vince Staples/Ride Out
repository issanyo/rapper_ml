[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed
Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Young nigga and I'm proper like
Couple hundred thousand on me, nigga, yeah, I'm baller like
Bitch I think I'm Dolemite, bitch I'm goin' poltergeist Who said this was overnight? Album four is really like
Crippin' on my minibike, either hoop or sellin' white
Brillo pad, the smoker's pipe, my pistol cocked, you tryna fight?
Say he wanna be a cuz, put his brains to the right
Bruh, this ain't the eighties, mane, niggas shootin' everything
You know the gang we represent, specialize in pistol grips
Shootin' out my momma's whip, always got an empty clip
Top Dawg in this bitch
Niggas puttin' dicks inside your baby momma's momma's lips
Shootin' all the witnesses, it ain't no fuckin' murder scene
Crips don't fuck with Crips so now his jeans look like the rival team
Wrong hat and shoes, put your ass on a forever dream
Heatin' up the summer 'til the winter fall, spring clean

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed
Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Young nigga and I'm proper like
Couple hundred thousand on me, nigga, yeah, I'm baller like
Bitch I think I'm Dolamite, bitch I'm goin' poltergeist Who said this was overnight?
Me and Vince, we crackin' like, crippin' in our afterlife

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Yeah, 'cause at Ramona Park we beef with everybody
Light or dark I'll spark, don't fuck with narcs
So don't be talkin 'bout me, my big homie made me, Get Em, Kill Em
Cause if I got 'em I'ma kill 'em, I ain't playin' with 'em
I'm from the bottom, that's the top of the town
We on the border, so they cliquin' up for knockin' us down
My burner tucked, I learned from Chuck so I ain't turnin' it down
Get to bussin', know you bluffed it, nigga
If that bitch can't make me rich then ain't no need in fuckin with her
Turn around and fuck her sister, heard that bitch got EBT
Long Beach ain't seen shit like me since Tracy D and DPG
I went and got a burner on the day they murdered Baby D
I'm in that Benz with Lil Boy, so, lil boy, don't play with me

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Ha, I'm ridin' cycs through Hoover Street, my knuckles full of teeth
Try to creep on me, you're dyin' in your homie's seat
Keeping to my gun in reach, for later beef
Clip reach from Figg side to Norfolk Beach
In a stolen Expedition, in your hood 'cause you the mission
Been a mathematician, load nine, subtracted eight
I'm keepin' one for just in case, don't cover face but I ain't trippin'
Blunt was laced, niggas know I'm 'round the way
So ain't no liquor stores today

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed
Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Young nigga and I'm proper like
Couple hundred thousand on me, nigga, yeah I'm baller like
Bitch I think I'm Dolemite, bitch I'm goin' poltergeist You said this was overnight
Me and Vince, we crackin' like, crippin' in our afterlife

[Outro: ScHoolboy Q]
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, get dough
Gs, gs, gs, gs, gs
Eyes closed
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
