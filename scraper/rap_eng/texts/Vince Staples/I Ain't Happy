[Verse 1: Cashius Green]
Ayy, shoes double size, triple size
Let me emphasize, plenty gasoline to light fires after the crime
Too many 9 milli's leave 'em drippy
Mouth tape like Milli Vanilli
Watch 'em go crazy, like Gideon supplyin' achilles
We got the dealies
Make you feel couped in a monster truck
Destructive, what? Hit the clutch and pop me a wheelie
Pop her left eye, hoes feelin' chilly
Shoulda thought twice, the strawberry Phillies don't roll right
Bitch know your rights, ho, not today
I'm on a killin' spree, Hennessy, don't get in my way
We can freaky, or you can be leakin'
Hit Peurto Rico for the weekend to confuse the precinct
Just sayin' I'm free
99 problems, and they all come back to bite a G, repeatedly
Gotta beat their knees, sprintin' ain't in my policy
Nigga, you're free to leave
Tell your bitch not to bother me
Baby moms to unfollow me
Who the fuck said I'm proud to be me?

[Chorus: Cashius Green]
Give me the fuckin' keys, I ain't happy
I couldn't make a dollar without trappin', the gun's still clappin'
Kill the witnesses, ain't nothin' gon' happen
Ain't made a dollar off this rap shit, who the fuck said I was happy?
Double down, that's a kilo
12,000 on the line, watch how I lick this casino
Or rob these niggas blind, take the money
Take the gold, take the watches
I know a nigga who pawns, where's my matches?
Let's burn this nigga alive
I ain't happy
I couldn't make a dollar without trappin', the gun's still clappin'
Kill the witnesses, ain't nothin' gon' happen
Ain't made a dollar off this rap shit, who the fuck said I was happy?
Double down, that's a kilo
12,000 on the line, watch how I lick this casino
Or rob these niggas blind, take the money
Take the gold, take the watches
I know a nigga who pawns, where's my matches?
Let's burn this nigga alive

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
I done lost my fuckin' mind
Got a revolver and a nine millimeter
Cheerleaders form a single file line for the dope
Out-selling bitches hope, by the half and pound
'Round the town, cops know the color of my clockwork
Tryna get my money, where my heart's worth at
Only sleepin' where the Mossberg at
How am suppose watch my back, when it's against the wall?
Niggas live to see you fall
Fuck who tryna make a change, all I wanna do is ball
I ain't never had to pot to piss in or no competition
So I ain't afraid of shit but dyin' broke and life in prison
This is the life a nigga chose, so 'til I die, I'll live it
Drive-bys in the Honda Civic, aim it at the children
Children of a promise, given by a false prophet
Tryna sell my dark thoughts to the world, we all got 'em
But still they try to label me
Mr. Crazy Nigga, guess that's just what I was made to be
Coldchain!

[Chorus: Cashius Green]
Give me the fuckin' keys, I ain't happy
I couldn't make a dollar without trappin', the gun's still clappin'
Kill the witnesses, ain't nothin' gon' happen
Ain't made a dollar off this rap shit, who the fuck said I was happy?
Double down, that's a kilo
12,000 on the line, watch how I lick this casino
Or rob these niggas blind, take the money
Take the gold, take the watches
I know a nigga who pawns, where's my matches?
Let's burn this nigga alive
