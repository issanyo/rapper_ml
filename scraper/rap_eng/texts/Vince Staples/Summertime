[Hook]
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know that, this could be forever, baby

[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes and tell me whatcha thinkin'
Open up your mind, and tell me whatcha seein'
Inside of me, why we fussin', fuckin' up this evenin'
I probably couldn't fix it if I knew the reason
Up on the sea, where I see you fallin' in the deep end
Is it love? I would really love to know the meanin'
What's the grudge that you're holdin'?
Hold my hand let me take you to the land
Where the ocean and the sands are meetin'
Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom
Open up your heart, if we don't love then we fall apart

[Chorus]
This could be forever, baby
I never seen you wetter, baby
Than when the tears fall
Soakin' up your sweater, baby
I didn't mean harm
Don't make me regret it, baby

[Bridge]
Cause if I never knew ya, I could never do this to ya
Hope you understand, they never taught me how to be a man
Only how to be a shooter, I only need the time to prove it

[Hook]
Cause this could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know that, this could be forever, baby

[Verse 2]
My teachers told me we was slaves
My mama told me we was kings
I don't know who to listen to
I guess we somewhere in between
My feelings told me love is real
But feelings known to get you killed
I feel as if I'm misconstrued
I spend my moments missin' you
I'm searchin' for atonement
Do I blame my darker tone?
I know somethings are better left unsaid
And people left alone
Pick up the phone
Don't leave me alone in this cruel, cruel world
