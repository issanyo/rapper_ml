[Verse 1]
My father said women only listen when you hit 'em
Gun to my momma head, sitting in the kitchen
I'm sorry I ain't the perfect kinda nigga
I tried to fix it, but nobody listened so I'm chillin'
My only dream is that I die before I make a million
Either that or take a L for dealing cause I'm trapped out
Tryna build a  castle from the crack house
Running out of rocks so I'm stuck to the stones, they've thrown at me
Nine times out of the ten I'm not happy
9th grade dreaming of Benz's that we'll never get
Banging for the hell of it, did it cause we wasn't scared to die
Just afraid to grow up and be something

[Hook]
They gon' love you when you gone nigga
They always love you when you gone nigga

[Verse 2]
I guess y'all fucked with the wrong nigga
Ex girls hating on me, police bangin' on me
See they just a bigger gang, but that shit's a different story
Living on the highest story, hoping I don't fall too hard
Saying "Yo, don't ball too hard", selling dope is not a job
Is what I tell myself everyday, but it's hard to stop
Kinda like I'm using, making use of all this time I bought
The rounds you fought were rounds I shot
See the police coming, run around the block
Ain't no need for court, we black so we already lost
Power to the people, seven rounds up in this eagle
Birds baths for your bitch ass

[Hook]
But they gon' love you when you gone nigga
They always love you when you gone nigga
Yeah they gon' love you when you gone nigga
Nigga

[Verse 3]
I bring pain, watch my .45 flame
Drive-by's, while I ghostride  Cam'ron's range
Bang like Jerome Lane, 3 or 4 K's, and a Kevlar underneath the 'Lo Chambray
Niggas gon' try me, I'ma blast they brains
Shotty's all I need, Cobain, coldchain
What's rap these days? Niggas running with the police
We gunning with the police,  Daytons on the gold jeep
Ride solo, cause nigga's known to squeal
Up in that glass room, singing like soul for real
Still, I made a promise to my momma that I'd never go to jail
So a nigga won't, burning shells, 'til I burn in hell
Had to double up my personnel for the clientele
Nigga's want it coming off the scales and need the sales
Pack a zip and ship it in the mail like report cards
And they said we wasn't gon' go far, yeah right

[Outro]
But they gon' love you when you gone nigga, right?
