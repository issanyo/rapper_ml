Screaming, I was never bothered by the vocals
Bleeding from the throat, blood seeping through the chokeholds
Stomach full of pills and distilled Four Loko
Wonder if she knew this was the last day, Lord knows

Bitch you got snatched from the back, no swag
Dirty whore, chloroform on the mat
Black matte, lipstick
Stick shift drive by, 2 gats 1 boyfriend
Lifeline flat, jack flap

And he was just a casualty, tell me why you mad at me
With him is what you wanna be, with me is where you have to be
But you was just travelin' I guess, tryna find yourself
Would you die before I see you with somebody else

Put your bags down, and don't say you're leavin'
You were at fault in your court, love cheatin'
I was gone for the weekend, oh
Now you can't tell? Go to hell
Bitch now you not no blue can shrell (?)

And a cell is where my mind is, trapped along timeless
Words spoken kindess to these women, the finest
Bloodlines and mysteries, her murder was a mystery
Lone wolf traveler, a lady-heart damager
