[Verse 1]
I just want to get my bread
And talk my shit before I end up dead
I got all this blood sitting on my hands
I never gave no fucks so they understand
Why I feel this way, just found God and I still don't pray
Cause Satan prey on the weak, swear I can do it myself
Soul stuck in the beats, it's like I'm crying for help
Still my expression is bleak
Because my mama ain't raised no bitch, never take no shit
From no nigga unless he want to see the black four fifth
From the ghetto where the oceans is, but all hope is lost
We know the laws and quick to break em once the dough involved
Young age, they wrote us off, guns blaze, they go to court
I got a lot of homies gone, product of their broken home
But who's to say what's right and wrong, they ain't live it
Looking straight into their eyes still and they ain't get it

[Hook]
But if I had a hundred dollars for every dream that I've ever had
I'd barely have enough to right the wrongs I did in the past
They say forgive and forget, look at it and laugh
We gave all that we had and got nothing

[Verse 2]
As far as music, kid, I'm innovative
Niggas pretend to hate it, influence you niggas favorite
You stupid believing different, authentic you lack the stitching
Sitting when it's game time, snitching when you face time
What's wrong with you niggas? See, I was brought up
Where that talking gets you shot up at apartments
Where the bitch that set you up had told you meet her just that morning
Just a warning, my performance astounding
Everybody want something, get these niggas from 'round me
Tryna climb skyscrapers
Life is but a dream but it's never what it seems
So I never leave my weapon at the house
Rather spend time sitting behind bars than in a grave
I'm getting paid trying to change from my sinning ways

[Hook]
But if I had a hundred dollars for every dream that I've ever had
I'd barely have enough to right the wrongs I did in the past
They say forgive and forget, look at it and laugh
We gave all that we had and got nothing

[Verse 3]
Working on my thousandth time telling you sorry
Walking around pretending it ain't affect me
But nothing was further from the truth
Least I'm trying to re-coop, just blame it on the youth
No matter what you feel or seen, I was in it too
Probably more than you would ever believe
You gave me something I would never receive again
We probably won't be again, but, would you expect it though?
I'm just the nigga that I promised you I was
When you swore that I was better
Was in it through the weather storm, just was better moving on
There was a time I thought I would never think about you again
You was the best friend a nigga could have
I used to call you when I thought that I would die that day
And you would calm me down and I would make my way
You probably should have stayed, it just wasn't your place
I thought about you today
