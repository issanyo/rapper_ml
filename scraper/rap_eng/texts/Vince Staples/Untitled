(Chorus)
Throwin' money on the floor
Pick it up, Do it slow girl
Show me what you're worth
If you're worth shit
Throwin money in the air
Make it rain in a drought
Girl show me what you 'bout
If you 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
See 'em hatin' on your shine now
Nah nah nah
They ain't 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
See em hatin' on your shine now
Nah nah nah

(Verse 1)
[?] for the outfit, Card notes for the convo's
Know they start with where you get those ?
Bad bitch in the forefront tryna' get chose
Six, six pumps in the ford trunk
No doe in the bank, But that ass look right
Right place, Right time might change your life
This could be a good night, Started off on a high note
Roll it in the paper, baby blaze it
Now you walking with ya' eyes closed
Eyes on you, You can barely see the room
Fuck the run around, What ya' tryna' let a nigga do
What a nigga gotta prove
Thats what everybody want, To be reassured
Fall in love, Reaping the reward
What you need to pour another shot
We livin in the moment, floating
Going through the motions
Keep ya' head above the waters tide
But I love to ride, Thats on every single dollar in my pocket
Bout to make them fly, See if you can stop it

(Chorus)
Throwin' money on the floor
Pick it up, Do it slow girl
Show me what you're worth
If you're worth shit
Throwin' money in the air
Make it rain in a drought
Girl show me what you 'bout
If you 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
See em hatin' on your shine now
Nah nah nah
They ain't 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
See em hatin' on your shine now
Nah nah nah

(Bridge)
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah

(verse 2)
Bitch look at me, Im the closest that you'll ever see
To livin' in a dream, Where the grass ain't never green
See we let it be, Cause the snakes is in the streets and
The water for the fiend's, All for [?] on the east
Ease up when you talking to a G, Out Ludlow
Bitch lets a nigga know, She never goin' switch
Had ho's on dick since my cell phone flipped
With the pre paid minutes and the ringtones in it
But can i get a minute of your time, Sit and listen
Feel like you could be whats missing to me
Be a mistress to me, Sort of been a mission to me
Since i can remember thoughts cloudy in my mirror
Couldn't tell ya' what you looking at but you looking back
Matter fact you was looking hard, No regard
I don't want ya' heart but it's 'til the star
If i had a bag for every broad that had me catching feelings
I'd have a million just to throw up to the ceiling

(Chorus)
Throwin' money on the floor
Pick it up, Do it slow girl
Show me what you're worth
If you're worth shit
Throwin' money in the air
Make it rain in a drought
Girl show me what you bout
If you 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
See em hatin' on your shine now
Nah nah nah
They ain't 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
See em hatin' on your shine now
Nah nah nah

Throwin' money on the floor
Pick it up, Do it slow girl
Show me what you're worth
If you're worth shit
Throwin' money in the air
Make it rain in a drought
Girl show me what you bout
If you 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
See em hatin' on your shine now
Nah nah nah
They ain't 'bout shit
They ain't 'bout shit
See em hatin' on your shine now
Nah nah nah
