Seven ten top back
Talking dough, yeah I'm 'bout that, yeah
Talking hoes, yeah I'm 'bout that, yeah
Girl you know that I'm 'bout that, yeah
Quit playing baby, stop that
Girl you know that I'm 'bout that, yeah
Getting dough, yeah I'm 'bout that, yeah
Niggas know that I'm about that, yeah

Bitch I'm bout it (bitch I'm bout it)
Ru-ru-run it everday I been making plays
Tryna bring some money round my way
Bitch I'm bout (bitch I'm bout it)
Mob-Mobbin' on the low, I been selling dope
Tryna make some money for my folks

[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
My bands up, my plans up
Momma' young boy don' manned up
These days I'm feeling like the man now
But we still getting shot with our hands up
Run up on the squad get fanned down
Fuck you wanna ball it's just a man down
'Member all the days that we ran wild
Now I'm making ten racks off a pay pal
Got my faith in God but I'm hell bound
So I'm weighing hard on the scale now
Just caught a charge post bail now
Back on the block making them sales now
Bust a bale down pack for pack
Get money yeah I'm bout that, yeah
Young nigga move weight on the block got my stock going up like a NASDAQ yeah
'Member days we didn't had that, yeah
Now I pull up in the 6
Didn't come with no hoe but gon leave with yo' bitch
Ain't come with my bro but I came with these clips
Cause niggas always wanna trip but the whole city know me
(How he scooped you up on High??) young nigga quick to rob that was on the north side but a nigga reside on the east side of Long Beach

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Life has its ups and downs
Fly so high you touch the ground
Do’s and dont’s the rights and wrongs
Just sing yo songs and dance around
Their hands around the necks of us
Devoid of all respect and trust
I'm tryna change my stomping grounds
It seems I'm acting funny now
Guess I'm not strong enough
Can't quit my cash not long enough
I long for slow life the grass and porch lights
You know good ole' suburbia
I love it when they ain't heard of us
I love it when they sing word for word
I might've thrown it all away
So I don't wanna talk today
No I don't want no Grammy plaques
I just want my grandaddy back
Ridin' in his Cadillac, like 'can I stay from school today?'
Lesson learned you crash and burn
Then hopefully they patch you up
Life is fast as lightning bolts
Live and learn to laugh it up
