[Chorus: Kučka, Vera Blue & Ngaiire]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Wake up in the morning
Yawning near you, on my mind
Would you mind movin' closer?
Let me look into your eyes
It's a sight for the ages
Got me anxious, so punch drunk right now
Loss and lovely, spun right 'round
I can't wait 'til the sun goes down

[Chorus: Kučka, Vera Blue & Ngaiire]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you

[Post-Chorus: Kučka, Vera Blue & Ngaiire]
I need you
To have you, hold you, squeeze you
So I'm going out every weekend
Just to see my boo again

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
If I care, hold your hand and walk you to the promised land
Would you take the trip or would you switch and flip the script?
No, this road ain't rowdy cobblestone
That big old house will make a home
All the money in the world, but you'll still die alone
I can't right my wrongs, so I just write my songs
Won't you dance with me to help escape my misery?
My two left feet are patient
Where you left me, I'm waiting
Send me your directions for my final destination

[Verse 3: Kučka, Vera Blue & Ngaiire]
These feelings I have for you
Can go deeper if you can come
Correct with your game, boy
No, no, no, you can't be late, boy

[Chorus: Kučka, Vera Blue & Ngaiire]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you

[Post-Chorus: Kučka, Vera Blue & Ngaiire]
I need you
To have you, hold you, squeeze you
So I'm going out every weekend
Just to see my boo again
