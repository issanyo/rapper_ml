[Verse]
Running 'til my last breathe, no skipping past steps
I'm killing it, cashed cheques on frivolous
Items cause it's more to come
I feel the void of the stolen young who need a voice
I never wanted hand outs, only freedom of choice
I got it planned out, a gun for every seat in the Porsche
They paying grands now they hear a nigga speak
Never fear a nigga sleeping on me
Who need the homies when the heater on me
My teacher told me that I ruined my life the day I dropped out
Wasn't in my plans I felt, fuck it I'll stop now
Diplomas ain't gon' keep me off them corners
My mama raised a soldier, not a scholar quote
Who shot ya over Socrates
I want alotta things in life before it's over with
Don't fuck with anybody who ever felt like I ever owed 'em shit
I did it on my own, cause I lived it on my own
Just accept it, my depictions perfected
Do you get it nigga?
