[Intro]
Niggas you know
Bitch-ass niggas

[Verse 1: Traffic]
Traffic, bitch, I'm on the grind
I ain't got time (I ain't got no time)
You playin' little games and shit, blowing up my line (what the fuck you want?)
Talk about the next bitch (what?), bitch you be lyin' (stupid-ass bitch)
Talk 'bout she called you, (talkin' 'bout she said what?), bitch you be lyin' (shut up, bitch)
You see I bought a new Range (you see that)
You see I bought a new chain (you see that)
You see I laced all my kids up, yeah I got some new things (I'm on that)
Niggas like loose change, pull up all black, nigga Bruce Wayne (lookin' like Batman)
Hoppin' out with the cape on, niggas like, "Yeah I'm safe, homes" (I'm good tho)

[Chorus: Traffic]
Bitch, I push the weight, bi- bitch I push the weight (I push it, bitch)
Bitch, I flip the sack, bi- bitch I be stackin' cake (I be stackin' it up)
Bitch, I'm on the grind, I ain't got time, fuck what you say (fuck it)
Fuck all these niggas and these bitches, just let them hate (get it)

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Niggas know the deal, when the beef cracked off
Hopped out with the ski mask off and the skinnys
Lil Vince don't skateboard no more
Got a black snub nose, gettin' busy, if he
Niggas get slapped like hoes on strolls
I been ten toes since rent been owed
On Paramount and 64th, go home invading [?]
Then dip like [?] on grandma's stove
My grandma cold, I flashed, they froze
I passed, I glow, they passed, they told
How quick they fold up in that cell
My cell's the same, just call my phone
Folks been makin' plays and sells
I played the game, don't play yourself
Just bang your brains and save yourself

[Chorus: Traffic]
Bitch, I push the weight, bi- bitch I push the weight (I push it, bitch)
Bitch, I flip the sack, bi- bitch I be stackin' cake (I be stackin' it up)
Bitch, I'm on the grind, I ain't got time, fuck what you say (fuck it)
And fuck all these niggas and these bitches, just let them hate (get it)

[Verse 3: Traffic]
I'm on one right now, I ain't sittin' down
My momma keep tellkin me to but the liquor down
Drunk as fuck how i fuck on a swisher now
With a bad bitch yeah its finna go down
I been a nigga, yeah ten toes down
County jail, nigga, to the fuckin' pent house
My momma said, "Don't let nobody in my damn house"
Being hard-headed, I let them all in
She used to come home hot, [?]
What you talkin' 'bout? I'm goin' all in
Michael Phelps flow, nigga I'm goin' all in
I can do anything, I'm Bo Jackson
From a street gang to the rappin'
Finna make a way, I can make it happen
If you really for action, we can get it crackin'
The K spin around lookin' like Michael Jackson (he, he)

[Chorus: Traffic]
Bitch, I push the weight, bi- bitch I move the pack (I flipped it, bitch)
Bitch, I flip the sack, bi- bitch I be stackin' cake (I'm gettin' the dough)
Bitch, I'm on the grind, I ain't got time, fuck what you say
And fuck all these niggas and these bitches, just let them hate (fuck 'em)

[Outro: Traffic]
Bitch, I alternate, bitch I cross the state (I'm overseas now)
Bitch, I elevated, bitch I hella made it, niggas hella hated
I ain't trippin', I said let 'em hate, 'cause I'm still goin' to get my cake
Got 'em mad 'cause I'm makin' my moves
I got 'em mad they can't stop my play (just let 'em hate)
(Just let 'em hate, Im gettin' cake
Just let 'em hate, just let 'em hate)
