[Verse 1: Vince Staples]

What these bitches want from a nigga, remember when they used to have love for a nigga

Runnin' round sayin' they gone dump on a nigga when they see him, and I hope they really mean it cause I'm ready when the time comes

Got stockpile guns, barrettas blacker than College Hill

Bullets in HD, shootin' where your momma live

No remorse cause fuck it, you get it how you live

If I die from a bullet...

[Hook]

And I'll probably never feel a nigga
Probably thinkin' that I'll probably never kill a nigga
Crime pays I'm just tryna be the richer nigga
Got me praying the the lord he'll forgive a nigga
