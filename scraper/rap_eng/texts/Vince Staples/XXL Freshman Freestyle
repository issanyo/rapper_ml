[Verse]
I apologize If I might be the reason that your son never made it back home
He should have gave up the phone
Armed robberies at Mayfair Park
Met every nigga that I got with me at Mayfair Park
The comraderies, I build is with niggas that will kill
Life start sheddin' tears and it's all downhill
I put my homies in the dirt, and the scars ain't heal
But my eyes stay dry, tecs pour out shells
Piss poor on the wic like "fuck it, I'm a crip"
Cause a blue collar nigga get treated like shit
Quite ironic, quiet on the set
Listen to the violence I encounter ridin' for the set
Followin' the guidance of the people penniless
Just another piece of shit
That the preachers wasn't reachin' with the speeches from the pit
Lookin' who we pit against, crime black on black
The police pull up, clap and wet our backs, till we laid out flat
And nobody care the next day, I guess it's no fair play
You see my big bro Pac so that means I'm strapped
North Side, NY on my baseball cap
Raised as a have not had plots on a fortune
Reduced lunch, had a nigga feelin' less important
Rich man in Porsches, broke moms on bus stops
Livin' with emotion, look what the love got
Sittin' in a church, givin' her last dollar
Prayer wasn't the answer, they was answered with "nada"
See my heavenly father no better
Than the one that put his dick in my mama
Long chedda was a dream
We was government cheesin' in 'em mugshots
Long as these niggas fiend for what the plug got
We gon' make our money with greedings on the side walk
Through car windows is tryna get the gig off
Knock a nigga wig off for actin' like a bitch
Keep a seven in the dresser and a mac up in the whip
Case they try to catch me slip-in'
