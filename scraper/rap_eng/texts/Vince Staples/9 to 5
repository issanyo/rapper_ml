(Hook: LaVish)
Everyday, I'm out here working
Trying to find my purpose, baby
And when the money comin' slow
You talkin'bout you wanna go
Funny how when I was paid
Your ass wouldn't stay away but hey
I ain't tripping cuz I'm on my grind
Fuck being in love, and a 9 to 5

(Verse 1: Vince Staples)
So you wanna sit and talk about I ain't got shit
But I remember I was broke and you was on my dick
I fucked up when I bought your stupid ass a Christmas gift
And now you act like I owe you shit
Bitch, well I don't mean to call you that, but
My mother taught me judge a woman based on how she acts
And you wanna down a brother cuz he ain't got stacks
Call it drama, and you wonder why Rihanna got slapped
But I won't do that, no I ain't too cool for the extras
I'd much rather mention, you know I won't forget you
Oops, I smell the cheddar, grab my shit, and then I hurry out
Ask me where I'm goin', don't worry 'bout my wherabouts
Who you think you fucking with? was up on some My Girl Ruckus shit
Now I'm on some Mrs. Celie purple colored grubber shit
Used to be the one love in my life
And now you don't mean shit so you must think twice, bye

(Verse 2: LaVish)
It's like damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?
A ho is a ho and I seem to only date 'em
What happened to the girl that's afraid to have sex
Now you all up in the club with a skimpy ass dress
Your fake ass breasts, but I don't even stress
And when I draw my team, I don't need a lesson
Your bunnies in the mall with your friends at Hot Topic
And wait what you doin' with that pamper, the high grits
My life is probly likely, don't love you bitch you know that
And I was your people when I asked you "where the hoes at?"
And you can find me where the clothes at
Tryna locate me, bitch, fuck a low jack
Calm your ass down, and buy yourself a Prozac
Always in my business, "fuck you, where the girl at?"
You had a life before, so bitch you need to go back
And I'm just a memory, picture me, and kodak, kodak, yeah
