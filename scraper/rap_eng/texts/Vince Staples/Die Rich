[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Lights dimming, niggas living off the thought of killing
Black out, only shine as the revolver hitting
Can't bring the homies around, they start to plot on niggas
And then I gotta fix it, Mr. Mechanic
That automatic is nothing pretty, it take the smile off niggas
Let em run a couple miles, I'll hit 'em
If not, I bet his grandma get 'em, it's just a true story
Them shells sit like two stories, I aim well
I look at all your hate mail as fan mail
Writing shit down, well-knowing that you wouldn't say it
Why you go and buy a chopper if you couldn't spray it
Lil niggas breaking arms, tryna play Rambo
Give 'em what they signed for and never what they planned for
Aiming out the backdoor, cutthroat, niggas know it
[?] Anaheim, Long Beach, hammer time
North to the East, get down, nigga stand in line
