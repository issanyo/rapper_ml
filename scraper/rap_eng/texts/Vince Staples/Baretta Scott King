[Hook]
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
I rap because I'm bored, and I'm bored because I hate everything
That I see day after day, out in L.A, I just stay
Because I'm scared that my life will be real once I leave
I hope God's gotta trick up his sleeve, just for me
If he there, or care about a nigga like that
Told the voices stuck in my head that I'll be right back
Can't get sidetracked, too much to lose
It's 1000 ways to die, way too many to choose from
The hardest part is wishin' for escape when you can't run
I'm unstable, not ready for when my fame come
So I prepare for the worst, I know them faggs will say
He snapped, but he snapped soon as his grandmother passed away

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
But at the end of the night, I don't know you niggas
So I feel as if It's nothin' that I owe you niggas
That 4 pound Goku's niggas, leaves holes big as whole foods produce section
But if I empty a clip
I'll still be empty as shit
Fuck all that sympathy shit
Find where my empathy went
Just wish you would leave me alone
Then I start righting my wrongs
Probably stop writing these songs
Now all this pressure is on
Standing in the midst of the fire
Just turn my back on the world
Cus everybody's a liar
Guess its time for me to find my messiah
All my scriptures come as bullets
And the bible's in the form of a rifle
Just take one to the head
I don't gotta recite

[Hook]
