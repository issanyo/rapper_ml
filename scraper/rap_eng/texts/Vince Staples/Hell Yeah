[Refrain: Vince Staples]
Pray before I drift into sleep
Salvation is a gift and a curse
Knees down on the steps of the church
Hell bound as I step through the earth

[Verse 1: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Old folks begging for redemption
Lost souls scratching at a stained glass window
Where the grease players touch
Where the young souls sing about happy days
Cold hands clutching on a lifeline
Hung by a man that preaches from a page
Given by another man that was looking for a rope or a reason

[Pre-Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
You and I don't feel obliged
Oh good Lord

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
But maybe I'm going to hell, yeah
Maybe you're going to hell yeah
For all our wicked crimes
But if we're already going to hell yeah
Hell, we might as well get stoned and crucified
Stoned and crucified

[Refrain: Vince Staples]
Pray before I drift into sleep
Salvation is a gift and a curse
Knees down on the steps of the church
Hell bound as I step through the earth

[Verse 2: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Salesman preaching from a soap box
Look at you pushing all ya sons and ya daughters
Like lambs to the slaughter keep feeding that book of revelation
If forgiveness is only for the privileged
Does the light shine brighter on a saint or a sinner
Who's praying to the sky
Keep looking for a chance of salvation?

[Pre-Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
You and I don't feel obliged
Oh good Lord

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
But maybe I'm going to hell, yeah
Maybe you're going to hell yeah
For all our wicked crimes
But if we're already going to hell yeah
Hell, we might as well get stoned and crucified
Stoned and crucified

[Bridge: Vince Staples]
Letter to my heavenly father
Would you worry 'bout me drowning or just walking on water?
Always felt that you would grab me 'fore I dearly departed
Loved you dearly but despair's all I feel when I frolic
Around the weary word is bond but it was broken by preachers
Pay my offerings, but officers was living like leeches
I feel it lost in me
Church by my apartment is the smokers' hangout
Behind my building is the dealers' crib
They smoke and hangout
I go to school with all the dealer's kids
They love to bang out
They know it's wrong but they don't feel the need to open their mouth
I thought you said the truth was taught by those who go in your house
But all I see is liars lying on my grandmomma's couch
You made a kingdom out of Solomon, I see you disregard the sin
But what about the Sodom and Gomorrah shit?
It's hopeless it's the crap
I hope you're not offended by the thoughts inside my mind
But hell it's hard to admit it's all you got, I'll take my side

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
But maybe I'm going to hell, yeah
Maybe you're going to hell yeah
For all our wicked crimes
But if we're already going to hell yeah
Hell, we might as well get stoned and crucified
Stoned and crucified
