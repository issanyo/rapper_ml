[Hook: DJ Dahi]
Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin'
Be my lover, be my lady
Other people drive me crazy
Really got me thinkin, about ya body

[Verse 1: Vince Staples & Jhené Aiko]
I know it was your birthday
I know I didn't call right away
I know it hurt you in the worst way
I know that I would trade it all if you stay
I know I'm not perfect
I know that everybody ain't
But if it's one thing I know that I know, I know nothing at all
You don't pick up when I call
I'll make it up by tomorrow
You know that love is a brawl
So I'll be fighting for ya, I'll be fighting for ya

[Hook: DJ Dahi]
Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin'
Be my lover, be my lady
Other people drive me crazy
Really got me thinkin, about ya body

Lalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalala

[Verse 2: Vince Staples & Jhené Aiko]
Can I hit it in the morning? Can I hit it in the night?
And if I told you that I love you would you know it was a lie
Pretty woman, how you function with the devil in your thighs?
I see heaven in your eyes, I love to see you cry
The drugs inside your mind got you thinking different
Why you hiding from me? Fuck your inhibitions
Why you crazy lover? Think that you should be my baby mother
Let me slow it down, think I'm kinda tripping

[Hook: DJ Dahi]
Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin'
Be my lover, be my lady
Other people drive me crazy
Really got me thinkin, about ya body

Lalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalala

[Bridge: Vince Staples & Jhené Aiko]
Ass fat, can I take it out them jeans? Lemme know
Church bells sing, wedding rings, Lemme know
Baby girl I'm ready, whatchu' ready for? Lemme know
Fuck the fuss and fighting, we should let it go, lemme know
Feeling like I need you, I need for you to lemme know
Nothing come between us, I need for you to lemme know
Everybody looking for that special soul, is it you?
If you think it's true, need you to lemme know

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Baby lemme know, if you feelin' right, you can spend the night
We can go, anywhere you like, nothing got a price
I suppose, that you wasn't quite the type who be doing it
Fo' sho, we can keep it on the low and take a load off
Soon as you walk up in the room, take ya clothes off
Bed to the floor, baby you know how it go
Nothing less and nothing more than what we make it
Consummating for a long time 'til the condom breakin'
Conversations in my head about some head, you got some commentary for a nigga?
I ain't tryna be too forward with ya, lookin' forward to ya
Tryna split a couple kids, maybe mortgage with ya
Do it all to get ya
So just lemme know

[Hook: DJ Dahi]
Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin'
Be my lover, be my lady
Other people drive me crazy
Really got me thinkin, about ya body

[Outro: Jhené Aiko]
I'mma let you know, that I got that dough
But if you take a toke
You gon' be runnin' round tripping 'til you get your hands on more, yeah
You gotta be certain cause 'fore you consider fucking me
Cause you hit this shit once I know you gon' be in love with me
