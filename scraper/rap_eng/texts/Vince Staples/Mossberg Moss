[Hook: Joey Fatts x2]
Pump on the dresser, pills in the drawer
Bulldog .44 send your ass to the lord
Yeah we getting money trapping but niggas want more
Run up in your house, hammers out, lay you on the floor

[Verse 1: A$ton Matthews]
Chopper city, chop the party, you know I had to rock the pump
Rock the body, chunk of that maserati, I drop the chump
I'm your pitchers pitcher, pitching broads
Sticking dick to jaws, I'm flipping cars, I'm switching broads
I hustle hard, I bag the work, birds let my packets chirp
Used to flip the dirt in the back of church
My pastor used to puff and pass it first
Had the pistol at the ratchet twerk
Just to let you know that you real and you can get murked
Pussy, slipping is a no go, yoppers only levitating OVO's
That's the motto, nigga yolo, rocking with the four four
Got the molly by the snow globe

[Hook: Joey Fatts x2]
Pump on the dresser, pills in the drawer
Bulldog .44 send your ass to the lord
Yeah we getting money trapping bud, and nigga want more
Run up in your house, hammers out, lay you on the floor

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Tell my mama "congratulations, you made a soldier"
I made a lot of money doing shit I wasn't supposed to
Put your baby on the poster, play by the rules if you want
No father figure, I came up around them starving niggas
Posted by the projects while you angles living off Olympic
Papa made a living off the choppers 'til the coppers flicked him
City's filthy, mean the business cause you heard it nigga
Back in '06 the YS used to murder niggas
So tell me, why would I be sitting here 'fraid to die
With this big ass 45 and all the homies by my side
Angels flying out that chamber, nigga catch a ride
Eastside, two G's, SF49
