[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
I done beat the breaks off niggas, shot the face off niggas
Pending case with the state, and I'm still out trippin'
All the feds take pictures, fuckin' up my image
Even mama bringin' drama, I don't trust no bitches
See these hoes be out here switching their sides
When its time for the killin' i ride
Look right in my eyes, been ready to die
Risk felony time for threatening mine, better than I, nobody alive
Nobody live the life that I did, fighting to live since I was kid
Playing in the yard with a 30-06
House look like a gun range, room look like a gun store
Either you're gonna know my name, or niggas dying young and poor
Either way don't give a fuck, you gon' find me northbound
With the shit, I'm in the shit, you know I love them gun sounds
7's cry, macs applaud, they taking shots, I had to call
You catch 'em out the shot gun, that's Roddy White from 50 yards
No body shots, I'm hitting jaws
Tryna run you Stephen Hawking
You see I mean this shit I'm talking, you don't want no problem

[Hook]
Slave to the rhythm, shoot my master in his back
Two dope boys, in the Cadillac strapped
Wood grain dash, windshield stained glass
Beatin' down the ave, like we back sellin' crack
Killin' for the karma, but livin' for my mama
Trouble what the call us, and nothing what they offer
Off 'em, and they wonder why niggas get shot
And they wonder why niggas shot

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Where you at, where you from? Cause it's hot where I'm at
Any time of the day you get robbed you get jumped
Itâ€™s a game we play, to get paid
For the wants to the needs to the young
Snakes slide through the grass
Blades slide in the back, of the used and abused
Tryna walk in my shoes
Get tripped by my fuse, too short
Ask God what you want, he said I want your life
Well I ain't live mine right, but if I do the crime I do the time
I ain't scared of shit, I was born to die
Extended clip, big .45 been quick to trip
Been lost my mind, when I die, please don't let mama cry
Cause she know it had to be him or I and I got caught slippin'
Get a gun and go knock that nigga
Run up on him, no mask, no feelings, no room for that
They shoot at us, then we shootin' back
Burnin' shells till I burn in hell
And I'm cool with that, that uzi packed
I done learned a lot in these 19 years
Lotta homies ain't shed one tear
God decide what my curfew is
So till that day, I'mma do my shit
I proved my shit, they know my name
Not proud of the outcome either have regrets or
Be out young, don't sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
