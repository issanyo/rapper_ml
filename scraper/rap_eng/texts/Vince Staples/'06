[Intro]
Next time on Poppy Street

[Hook]
Good mornin', hope you had a good time last night
I need money from e'rybody, mo'fucker, better pay your tithes
Now I can change your life, fuck what's wrong, fuck what's right
What you want? What you like? Your world been mine

[Verse]
There's niggas gettin' paid over there
And niggas got it made over there
I'm finna bring the gang in the builâ€” *static*
