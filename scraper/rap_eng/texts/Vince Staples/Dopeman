[Intro: Joey Fatts]
Tell me whatchu need, bitch you know a young nigga got it
Pills to the weed, Poppy Street, niggas 'bout that profit
I'm the dopeman, out here servin' dope to nigga's mommas
I'm the dopeman, tell me whatchu need, I got that-

[Hook: Kilo Kish]
I don't need a gun just to melt a nigga brain nigga
I could pull up to the slums with a quarter ki of caine
I'm the dopeman, I'm the dopeman
I can get you high, baby I don't need a plane
You should hurry up and buy cause we sellin' everything
I'm the dopeman, I'm the dopeman, get with the program
Get with the program

[Interlude: Vince Staples]
Alright, alright, alright, we gonna do it just like this! I need a kilo of everything you mufuckin' got, we tryin' to sell it all! Crack, coke...

[Verse: Vince Staples]
Spend the summer days sellin' hay
Spend the summer nights sellin' white
FEDs settin' traps on the A
Yams had the Act in the ice
Alright, tryin' to make a dollar bill
Don't hide, pay me mine and getcha mama killed
Whatchu need, whatchu got makin' plays
'Til I'm laid in the grave, gettin' paid
