[Verse 1: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Old folks begging for redemption
Lost souls scratching at a stained glass window
Where the grease players touch
Where the young souls sing about happy days
Cold hands clutching on a lifeline
Hung by a man that preaches from a page
Given by another man that was looking for a rope or a reason

[Pre-Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
You and I don't feel obliged
Oh good Lord (Lord, Lord, Lord)

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
But maybe I'm going to hell, yeah
Maybe you're going to hell yeah
For all our wicked crimes
But if we're already going to hell yeah
Hell, we might as well get stoned and crucified
Stoned and crucified

[Instrumental]

Stoned and crucified

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Salesman preaching from a soap box
Look at you pushing all ya sons and ya daughters
Like lambs to the slaughter keep feeding that book of revelation
If forgiveness is only for the privileged
Does the light shine brighter on a saint or a sinner
Who's praying to the sky
Keep looking for a chance of salvation?

[Pre-Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
You and I don't feel obliged
Oh good Lord (Lord, Lord, Lord)

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
But maybe I'm going to hell, yeah
Maybe you're going to hell yeah
For all our wicked crimes
But if we're already going to hell yeah
Hell, we might as well get stoned and crucified

[Instrumental]

Stoned and crucified

[Instrumental]

[Bridge: Vince Staples]
Pray before I drift into sleep
Salvation is a gift and a curse
Knees down on the steps of the church
Hell bound as I step through the earth
Pray before I drift into sleep
Salvation is a gift and a curse
Knees down on the steps of the church
Hell bound as I stepâ€“

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
But maybe I'm going to hell, yeah
Maybe you're going to hell yeah
For all our wicked crimes
But if we're already going to hell yeah
Hell, we might as well get stoned and crucified
Stoned and crucified

[Instrumental]

Stoned and crucified

[Instrumental]
