[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm just a nigga until I fill my pockets
And then I'm Mr. Nigga, they follow me while shoppin'
I feel like Mick and Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters
So tell me what's the difference, so tell me what's the difference?
My momma was a Christian, Crip walkin' on blue-waters
Was fadin' up in Davis, then walkin' back to Palmer
A fro like Huey partner, Auntie Angie had them choppers
So tell me what's the difference, so tell me what's the difference?
I feel like "Fuck Versace", they rapin' nigga's pockets
And we don't get acknowledged, just thank me for the profit
A prophet just like Moses, if Moses look like Shaka
Zulu, my .44 loaded, I'm aimin' at Nirvana
My bitch look like Madonna, they starin' at Katana
Waiter still ain't brought the chopsticks, should have brought the chopper
Uber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer
But he lookin' at me crazy when we pull up to the projects

[Hook]
See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray Jehovah lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions fix me up
I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe?
Life ain't always what it seems, so please just lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up

[Verse 2]
We love our neighborhood, so all my brothers bang the hood
I never vote for presidents, the presidents that change the hood
Is dead and green, was standin' on this mezzanine in Paris, France
Finna spaz cause most my homies never finna get this chance
All these white folks chanting when I asked 'em where my niggas at?
Goin' crazy, got me goin' crazy, I can't get wit' that
Wonder if they know, I know they won't go where we kick it at
Ho, this shit ain't Gryffindor, we really killin', kickin' doors
Fight between my conscience, and the skin that's on my body
Man, I need to fight the power, but I need that new Ferrari
Man, I breathe in, bleed this Poppy Street
I shot them guns cause talk is cheap
Bow your head and pray, okay, now walk wit' me

[Hook]
See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray Jehovah lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions fix me up
I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe?
Life ain't always what it seems, so please just lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
(Lift me up, lift me lift me up, lift me lift me up, lift me lift me lift me up)
