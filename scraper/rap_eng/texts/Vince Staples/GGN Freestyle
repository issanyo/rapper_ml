They tried to kill me in my younger days
Slave to the block, not a runaway
Funny how a nigga get a whip or run away
Funny how a nigga get a chain or run away
They tried to kill me in my younger days
We was on the block like it's hunger games
We was from the cops like it's hunger games
Said we was running from the cops like it's hunger games
Northside LB, nigga's can't tell me nothing
I hope the scales be tipping in my favor
I was thirteen busting at the neighbors
Then I was fifteen fucking on the neighbors
I had a 16 before I turned sixteen
Fourteen with a [?]
I made a hundred racks and gave it to my momma
I made fifty racks and bought the homies choppers
I made a hundred racks and gave it to my granny
I make a million dollars when I hit the grammy's
And if I don't, nigga so what?
We got the whole Long Beach sold up
