[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Don't confuse me with your day-to-day
Hip-hop nigga from the crip gang
I ain't ever crip walk nigga
That blow will knock your lips off nigga
These rappers look a lot like them Kris Kross niggas
You a joke, joke I really mean it
Was banging on that block, I really seen it
Went from bitches on WIC to bitches that's bulimic
Mornings I wake up feeling like I'm dreaming
Sway, this is coming off of the top
My daddy move yay, shave grams off of the top
In the DM sweet talk off of the top
Leave the g-string on but it's off with the top
I was really at the park with the Glock
These niggas going to the mall when they shop
Hit the Def Jam office park right in the spot
Cause Im the best thing going since Kanye opened for Kweli
Remember when I hid the gun in the trunk of your car?
Funny cause that was just some weeks ago
Secret shit nobody really need to know
I need the glow, north side I need the Po
Cause niggas tryna take my life, why you tweaking bro?
Just a couple of dead beats from dead hoods
I got sick of the break beats so break bread
Black Bono
Couple days ago I heard new Ye in chicago and turned up the volume
You play your shit you won't get the same outcome
I'm living life where I'm from we be out young
Gun shots, let 'em know the game changed
Never let no white girl call me by my slave name
A 12 gauge in the champagne buick and I use it
Fuck this music, I'ma make a nigga brains hang
Ask my mom, she'll probably say the same thing
Cause I had grew up in the era where we can't change
We do or die, do it all for the beef
Guess the nigga just don't hang far from the tree
Strang fruit, grey coupe, brown rag on the seat
Chipped tooth when I bit the gift sent from Eve
So I'm on my own, god sent for me
65th 'til I RIP, my squad symphony
Symphony of my sorrow, no hope for a better tomorrow
Hope for big booty bitches inside the fucking Bellagio
Money coming like a fucking ferrari go
All off the audio, pain on my mamas soul (x4)

Sway: "Talk about that boy Joey Fatts, man"

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Bitch I'm from Ramona
That's right around the corner from the water tower
Me and Joey Fatts was riding giving chopper showers
Aston Matthews from west side piru
But if I'm riding with my nigga then my crew ride too
Shot by the enemies, niggas they not no friend to me
Kill 'em like the Kennedy's, you know how it goes
Obama never been to Long Beach
So we ride around the city carry strong heat
And all my homies shooting at the police
Its well documented free Stretch frees?
And free Rico, guns from the cheat codes
Never had no pea coat
Was beefing with my PO at 15 years old
Police sitting out my window
No burglar bars, we was burglaring cars
Fishing for radios
You hear me on the radio now

Sway: "Talk about where you travel to, Vince Staples you been all over the world baby. Go ahead and talk to 'em!"

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
In a couple weeks I'm about to go to Paris
I know my enemies feeling real embarrassed
I had my passport before I had an ID
15, I seen my homies on that IV
And now I'm Texas, Austin south-by-southwest
Everyday no matter what it's costing
A lot of niggas flossing but that jewelery rented
I went down to New York, I been to Atlanta
My homies had the civic, we was creeping with hammers
You niggas been in bitches, ain't worry about manners
I'ma do what I got to cause I gotta feed my mama
Niggas down for the drama, I ain't worry about karma
Speaking of karma just got off stage with Common
Kanye came on, 1 hour he rock it
See your mama in the store, I'ma pass by her
Tell her that her son a bitch and a damn liar

Sway: "What about them ex-girlfriends man, all them exes in your life"

Vince: "I can't get into that cause some shit happened the other day, but it's all good"
