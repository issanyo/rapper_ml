[Intro: Steve Sincere]
No chase, no problem
No wop, no conscience

[Verse 1: Steve Sincere]
Let me stone cold stunner ya
Tiger uppercut, professional punisher
I'm the man that you running from
Leave you with a bag to go number two a pan to go number one
Think you better homie, man you is fucking dumb
Merk you, put you in the back of a avalanche
Drop that shit off a cliff, let that shit avalanche
Once it explodes do the cabbage patch
Cash is first, actions last
But I be smashing first then I be passing last
Screaming FAMxBIZ or else, fuck it
I'ma let the young pit spit, so it's more felt

[Verse 2: A$ton Matthews]
And I stun 'em like FAMxBIZ, fuck your set
Cut the cheque or cut your neck
Kill for these bills, rip your heart out your fucking chest
Stop breathing, I ain't shit [?] yet
This is dry heaving, cut your hands if you try eating
Off the same plate, fighting for the same thing
But we in a different class, boy you need to gain weight
Haha, if you really tryna rumble
Chop you shrimps up and stir you in that pot, gumbo
Yeah, a rocket hang you from a clothes wire
Play the game soft, [?] with some pro pliers
Cut yourself out or fall up in the seat and then
I roll by ya, either way they'll have to bow tie ya

[Hook: A$ton Matthews x2]
This for my villains that ain't got no feelings
No chase, no problem, problem
No chase, no problem, problem
No conscience so solve 'em

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Bitch I'm a monster, fuck Jason and Freddy
You hoe niggas can't hold no water like broke [?]
Black teeth, black jeans, up under black shades
All black camero looking like it's from the bat cave
Ha, I'm the Inglewood Bruce Wayne
I got 'em shook like untied shoe strings
Soon as the money arrived, that's when the coopes came
Wide body, slow motion, two cups, and two lanes
I feed nigga, capital B nigga
Smoking them sweet swishers and keeping it G witcha
Eastside, I go hard, trunks on [?]
Fucking the world with no condoms, I'm so raw

[Verse 4: Steve Crook]
Took me a minute to [?] to get this finished
Cause villains is living and swimming and jellyfishing in women
Tentacle drilling venom in 'em, [?] missions
Of things I ain't supposed to be doing, now I'm finished
Black rose and oh no, y'all didn't know
No one's flow is as vicious as mine, kid icarus time
Bitches rewind and vision how I vision these lines
Pick up a nine, click it, and quickly put six in your spine

[Hook: A$ton Matthews]
This for my villains that ain't got no feelings
No chase, no problem, problem
No chase, no problem, problem
No-(hey, what're you listening to?)

[Verse 5: Vince Staples
Listening to Jagged Edge, my switchblade has a jagged edge
Dicapatated lesbians, I never had to ask for head
Coulda got a job but I chose a fucking swag instead
Choke-slam mannequins and swear it was a accident
My words speak louder than your actions
That's prolly why I'ma ask where your ad-libs come from
Dumb young nigga with a trigga off safety
Burning down Macy's, shooting down gay teens

[Verse 6: Mike G]
Anything other than OF is bad language
Always shoot first, see me on my John Wayne shit
And after first degree there's no way to cope
And you a faggot if you saying that boys is 2Dope
No hope, for you regulars, amateur, bet I sever ya
And I could go on forever saying you ain't on our level
But I kill 'em all quick, body parts in the open
I dump 'em all in acid and watch you fucking decompose then
