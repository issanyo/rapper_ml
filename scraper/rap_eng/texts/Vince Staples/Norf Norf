[Verse 1]
Bitch, you thirsty, please grab a Sprite
My Crips lurkin', don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave and get shaded
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start bustin'
Put that on my Yankee hat, I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shootin' in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a creole
T-Skrap moving for the d-low, and he know

[Chorus]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach, Norfside, Long Beach

[Verse 2]
Hit the corner, make a dollar flippin'
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Knowin' change gon' come like Obama and them say
But they shootin' everyday 'round my mama and them way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Crippin' where I'm livin', come and follow me
Pistol poppin', Poppy Street (Poppy Street)

[Chorus]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach, Norfside, Long Beach

[Verse 3]
Nate Dogg still here 'cause of niggas like me
Police still scared 'cause of niggas like me
In the hood, like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't with the business, nigga
Who you murdered? You ain't heard of Coldchain
Best thang, smokin' out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty runnin' Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Frontin' with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from street, they a nigga best, yes
'Cept for Little Halftime, Brody bangin' five blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Crippin', Long Beach City, pay a visit
Park Ramona, Pop block the corner
Givin' hell 'til it's frozen over, I ain't never ran from nothin'

[Chorus]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach, Norfside, Long Beach
