[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
She loaded, I mean it, pills and potion
Prescriptions and so more shit
Heartbeat and tryna focus, I mean it, she a novice
To those vices since that prom night
She been lifeless off that Xan and that white mixed emotions
White lightning, striking, scorch your throat
Who gon' take her home? She just taking shots
Wait, don't rock the boat
Please no falling off, don't kill my vibe
Get high, we live to die
Please don't rush the flow
One more pill, might overdose
One more pill, might overdose

[Hook: Vince Staples]
So damn high, I might see a ghost
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn high, might see a ghost

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Way past post-dramatic, trained to go, born a savage
Battle scars, you battle more
There's tents and dents up on that Charger
Late foreign she let your daughter on the way
If you make dollars everyday
You faced a problem, you'll be straight
Can't find a vine, done lost your way
Another product of the pavement
No acquittals, catching cases
Drown in liquor, pray for rain
You love them prescriptions everyday
You get lifted, sell a couple on the side
Indulge and binge and you're on a route to get your life
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
One more pill, might overdose
One more pill, might overdose

[Hook: Vince Staples]
So damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn high, might see a ghost

[Outro: Vince Staples]
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn
You're so damn high
You're so damn high, might see a ghost
You're so damn
You're so damn high
