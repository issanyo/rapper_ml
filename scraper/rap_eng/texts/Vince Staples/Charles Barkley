[Intro] [Vince Staples]
My Shirt Off

[Verse 1] [Vince Staples]
It's A Tuesday, I Done Hit Like Ten licks In 2 days
So Im Trying To Lay Low, Cops Row Past Twice
But They Probably Ain't Know That Gang Injunction Shit Ain't No Joke
All The Homies Straight Locs, And The Homies Know Me
Nigga's Like To Act Hard So The Homies Row Deep
Homemade Tattoo's Read "R.I.P". Make One False Move And We Beat Yo Ass
School Started At Eleven But Skipped My Class
Got Some Money To Make, Broad Day With A Gun On My Waist
Leave Home I Might Run In Your Place
Take Whatever I Like Flaunt It Right In Your Face
Thatâ€™s the way that shit goes when you dealing with a heathen
Got Nothing To Lose So Im Begging for A Reason
All Black M9 Just Begging For A Squeezing
The Second I Release It You'll Be Begging For Your Breathing Back

[Verse 2] [Clayton Samus]
Waving At The Jacob, They Ain't Even Know That I Got The Rogue
Status Rustling In The Backpack With Some Dope And Rolex
"Shit Ain't Even Mine But It's Mine Though"
Chop it up and drop it, Double up dopplegangin im a problem, Barkley Back in 93 play the 4 Bro can push the 1, That's Hardaway To Get The Dope
Hide The Blow Strong Arm & Hammer, Off Camera
Niggas talkin hotheadedGet you embered by the Charmander
All Black Swag With Some Ill Nature Still Wavie With A Lil Bit Of Gold And A Pager
Hustling For That Midnight 87 iroc-z 28 wit the triple gold daytons
Got To Stack Yapers, Matter Fact Grab The Loud Pack
Watch For Nigga's Lurking, Catch Them Vapors, Get Yo Mouth Smack
Give A Couple Days Before We Can Bounce Back
Hit a nigga for his whole stash and his wavecap
