[Vince Staples]
Been on track, I was trained by the martyrs
We ran from them cases, the cops should applaud us
If god is my father then where was the condom
"Astaghfirullah" when I pull out the chopper
Father did a bid for killing innocent kids
Now his kids not innocent, penitentiary eminent
Spawn of ignorance, they sold crack at my christening
Raised in the shacks, here's a map, come and visit
Fuck that teenage hypebeast crowd, this here some nigga shit
Spit them bedish of bars, the cars out in the yard
Used for trafficking Africans to the motherland
Son of Sambo, sold glow flow flammable heaters
At the crib, twenty deep, watching Hannibal Lecter
I lecture niggas, you eye witness
Confess to niggas, on that Daivion Davis
If we ever see that nigga bet we kill him, quick fast
Eagles give him whiplash, Reggie White, nigga say goodnight
I talk shit cause I paid the price and I'll take your life
Wanna test your luck, roll the dice and get little diced
(from the movie)

[Speak]
Came from the land of the black bar mitzvahs
SS Thunderbolt six foot Hitlers
Rims on the truck truck spin like a dreidel
Love for the fast life attraction fatal
Grave to the cradle then I run up in your crib
Fifty racks up front or your kids won't live
Pressure point panic mode well something gotta give
I leave my mark like the needle on the dope fiends limbs
Powder blue timbs powdered toast man muddy mud skipper
With a jug of dirty brown liquor
Got the bitches lit like a goddamn manora
Then I put the beard-face to her labia majora
Scream from the pleasure girl cry from the pain
All I wanted was respect and my goddamn chain
All I got were the labels trying to send me assignment
Ghost writing gigs trying to keep me up in silence
I'm from the west coast bitch we invented violence
Don't believe me check the tape on the '92 riots
I never met a bridge that I didn't want to burn
Never met a dollar bill that I didn't want to earn
Kill them put them in the urn, send them to my undertaker
Bored with this life and I hope to meet my maker
I'll look him in the eye and I tell him thanks for nothin
Self-made twenty somthin I deserve to be stuntin
