[Verse 1: King Mez]
Ain't no new nigga got a flow like mine
The south said I'm immortal the west treat me like they kid
So don't talk to me bout these rappers, give a fuck what they did
Headed home while they heating lobster up I got from Dre crib
So homie please don't get embarrassed
A platinum won't help you, no that won't save your merit
All your homeboys, family, and friends won't know ya
They won't know ya like [?] don't know [?]
Fucking with me cause everybody know I been getting to it
Might be hot to touch with some things but admit to it
God be trying to talk to me sometimes I wish I listen to it
Wish I did drink to have the excuse the liquor do it
Brand new problem, talking to the top tier
You can tell yourself what you're feeling right now is not fair
But I don't fuck with a bar, that ain't how I got here
No nigga breathing that gon' tell me my throne is not near, nigga

[Verse 2: J Doe]
J-Doe, hey listen
I'm bout to kick this shit harder than ever, I'm sorry FIFA
I'm wearing snakeskin and leather, I'm sorry PETA
I moved on from a top model, yeah I'm sorry Eva
And I ain't even off a bottle, I just got a fever
Now how should I approach this
I gotta step on all these cock-a-roaches, yeah
Inglewood boy, I'm West Coast-in'
Which means I know how to move around these vultures
Pull up on the scene in that Ferarri
I'm tryna leave the scene with Tinashe
Ayy shawty come through and say "what up doe?"
I be the fliest guy sitting by the front row
Flexin' on 'em, yeah welcome gun show
Every dude hating, I'm what every woman want though
I guess I can deal with that
I came from the bottom, look at where I'm chilling at
I wrote a song for every singer and I'm killing rap
Boy you gotta be lame if you ain't feeling that
Now let me put that juice on it
I heard I gotta leave 'em with that "oohh" moment
My pen killer, no Quentin Miller
I been trilla than a chinchilla rocked in 100 degrees
Boy it's a hundred of you, it's only one of me
So you know I gotta leave them boys with something to see
Cold life and it ain't fair boy
What you looking at is such a rare story
Cause anything in my way I destroy
Whole lot of bombs left for me to deploy
Oh, you can't sit up at the top cause that's my seat boy
J Doe got to go, Bruce Lee, Boy

[Verse 3: Raury]
Who’s the new kid? who’s the new kid?
Came out of nowhere saying that he’s gon' do shit
Talking bout indigoism, that ain’t new shit
Wrote and produced his album, that can’t be true shit
Since this game is fake man, I hope he don’t do shit
Just a rebellious nigga that needs a new kick
Hipster slave master, just a plant backed up
By the pot we call industry he grew way too fast I’m
Making up excuses for why I can’t do this
I been grinding with my crew since ‘02, I been moving
Every club setting, every joint juking
Networking passing out my mixtape, I’m grass rooting
And I’m starting from the bottom, still I’m at the bottom
Like go and get a ladder with the gat and go and pop 'em
Ain’t no way that he deserve this cause I’m the one who’s working
Probably pay somebody out of purse to go and write the verses
Americans are lazy because that’s how they want us
The world is getting worse because they want that shit to happen
To make a new world order, to save a hundred thousand
But nigga nah, you don’t listen, just turn up that television
Keep wishing for those new Jordans, bumping that new Kanye
E Pluribus Unum will be the one who really can save
Us from the evil of dollars the invisible collars
My ego’s desires, we burning the fires of hell on earth
And you can take offense if I say that there’s something wrong
I never seen a heaven on Earth
I know that’s his wish, to blast me from my blasphemous quo
But show me heaven and I’ll hand you the coat
Grab my coat, take a walk
To Nirvana, that Shangri La, that place of peace we call heaven
I see it, don’t blame me now, give me eleven seconds
One to pray for forgiveness
Two to see Mr. Marley
Three to blow down a seven
Four to say hey to Malcolm
Five to say hey to Martin
Six and then I’m departing
Seven to take a picture
Eight to post it on Twitter
Nine to kick it with Hendrix
Ten to tell him I’m leaving
Eleven you pull the trigger, pull the trigger

[Verse 4: Casey Veggies]
I reminisce when I was younger
Just getting started when it was all about the hunger
Sleeping in class, dreaming, how long I used to wonder
What you doing, youngin in the water doing under
You don't hear me though
Flirting with girls up in the hallways, young love
In high school you said you'd be there always
Fast forward a few years, we graduated then we part ways
This song got me thinking about the old days
See I love to ball but then I love the music
I had a choice to make, I swear that it was hard to chose it
I had a talent man and no one knew it
[?] is something they can hold you to it
Then you gotta go and do it with a team like I recruited
And I don't hesitate, I had to figure out my fuckin' way
And all I got is memories from the other days
I write my story need another page, yeah

[Verse 5: Vince Staples]
They tried to kill me in my younger days
Eighth grade with the pomade on another wavelength
Of the barrel make a brother want to run away
We hear it and then you hear a mother lost her son today
Me, Slim, Thump, and Fade before they took my brother away
Everything I'm rapping really happened where my mother stay
Lying in their songs, you felons selling cane
Feds tapping all the phones and they never said a thing
Bitch please, let me breathe, getting sick of all the fakes
This a young man race, getting sick of all the greats
Back out before you blow your back out, city loving Vince
This feel like when the government was giving crack out
The most creative, young and innovative
I'm from the city where the skinny niggas ride but they never make it
Momma told me "Baby, live your life before somebody take it"
So I keep a nine cause I plan on keeping mine
And you can keep in line, I ain't fucking with the rules
Wise men never win in the company of fools
So I'm cool, fuck whoever had the better sales or a better year
Here to get the record clear, I'm better than whoever here
Any day and whatever year
I really came from the gang so this game I will never fear
Tell Snoop we back and they ain't fucking with us
If they got a problem with that then they can come and kill us
