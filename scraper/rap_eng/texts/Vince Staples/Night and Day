Where’d I find this feeling
It’s like it just came out of thin air
Awake or am I dreaming
So surreal but I ain’t sleeping yet

You move me like I’m in an interstellar ocean
Jupiter and Mars
I’m surfing through the stars to you
Riding high on the waves of these emotions
Feel my beating heart so
Loud I wanna shout out

Night and day
Night and day
Got you on my mind
Girl you’re so divine
Night and day
Night and day
Thinkin’ bout your lips
Oh the way you kiss

You’re cinematic
Dramatic shadow from the setting sun
It’s just like magic
To watch our frames play out one by one

You move me like I’m in an interstellar ocean
Jupiter and Mars
I’m surfing through the stars to you
Riding high on the waves of these emotions
Feel my beating heart so
Loud I wanna shout out/I’m telling you

Night and day
Night and day
Got you on my mind
Girl you’re so divine
Night and day
Night and day
Thinkin’ bout your lips
Oh the way you kiss
