[Intro:Jesse-V ]
Aye, I'm bout to hit the store bout 10:30 best friend
You can just hit me back with 10 $ then we can chill , you know what I'm sayin'?
I'mma pick you up for the day ...

[Hook: ainya chillan]
Lemme be the one you call when it's time to get dressed
Lemme be the one you call when you're tryna hit the block
Lemme be the one you call when you're ready to hit the beat
Lemme be the one you call when you tryna turn it up in the sheets
I won't let my boy wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I won't let my boy wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Verse 1: ainya chillan]
Niggas arnt forever, he my main forever
Had me laughing forever, I was on his back forever
All the funny texts, I was smiling' wider
Now I got him rapping' tracks, now it's like whatever
Put down that fitted cap he got him some snapbacks
Got him a nike bag, shoes for 40 G's
Lips keep on getting sexyer, cause he keep gettin' nicer
Got him that sexy crib, nothing can separate us
When I'm in upper darby , I'm just a text away
Or on the south west , blind like I'm Ray Charles
I put up the the shout, time to chill in drawings
Jesse say I'm just chilln before I before go off his verse

[Hook: Jesse-V]
Lemme be the one you call when it's time to get dressed
Lemme be the one you call when you're tryna hit the block
Lemme be the one you call when you're ready to hit the beat
Lemme be the one you call when you tryna turn it up in the sheets
I won't let my girl wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I won't let my girl wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Verse 2: Jesse-V] pussy ain't forever, she my friend forever
Jeans tight as aerobic clothes so you know we small as ever
Girls in my pictures laughing' with this beauty
No im cheap as ever, and she better pay altogether
I got homies in Darby, as well as Baltimore ave
She in stores with cameras, as well as security guards
How we get food can't be debated, the niggas never caught
Talking feine ninjas, master plan, well thought

[Hook: Jesse-V]
Lemme be the one you call when it's time to get dressed
Lemme be the one you call when you're tryna hit the block
Lemme be the one you call when you're ready to hit the beat
Lemme be the one you call when you tryna turn it up in the sheets
I won't let my girl wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I won't let my girl wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
