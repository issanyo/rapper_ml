[Intro]
Young Mullah Baby
Oh
Oh
Whoa
How I'd let him come back (x2)

[Verse 1: Naomi]
She wants ya, I need ya
Please tell me to stay
She says that she loves ya like I love ya
But you know that it ain't the same

We had a fling
This I know
But now we got a thing
She gotta let yo go

[Pre-Hook]
Cause now I'm actin' crazy
I'm out here callin' you baby
I shouldn't have let you hit that
Cause now I can't forget that
I thought I wouldn't really give a fuck
But now a bitch all in love

[Hook] (x2)
Don't mean to be a hater
But "Ooh, shit, damn!"
You so good (x6)
So "Ooh, shit, damn!"

[Verse 2: Naomi]
I miss ya, I can taste ya
Please come back to me
Baby lie in my arms
And say you'll never leave

I gotta thing and I know you know
So boy don't play with me, just stay with me
And allow me to give you more

[Pre-Hook]
My girls all call me crazy
Cause I'm out here callin' you baby
I shouldn't have let you hit that
Cause now I can't forget that
I thought I wouldn't really give a fuck
But now a bitch all in love

[Hook] (x2)
Don't mean to be a hater
But "Ooh, shit, damn!"
You so good (x6)
So "Ooh, shit, damn!"

[Lil Wayne:]
I got that good good
And when comes to me every woman that could would
Baby I'm electric
Now you infected
What am I to do, but you
When you let me
Holla at ya boy but don't lose ya voice
And Weezy make it moist
Yep
And we was like "Ooh" then "Bam"
And she like "Ooh, shit, damn!" Haha
I told you I had a girl
And you told me you're a badder girl
I say, "Hey, I ain't tryna argue
I ain't even trippin' shawty, I'ma call you."
And I did
So I can't really blame you baby
'cause I did, so we might as well make it official
Like a ref with a whistle
At the Super Bowl game
Red and Wayne
Yeah!
I like this
You shouldn't have let me hit that
Now you can't forget that
Haha

[Hook]
But "Ooh, shit, damn!"
You're so good (x6)
(So "Ooh, shit, damn!"
