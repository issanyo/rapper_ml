[Intro]
Scoob in this bitch with me
But this about you
Ooh, let's go

[Verse 1]
Girl, you know I love ya, and I'm there for ya
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya
I got some candle lit and some underwear for ya
Them edible underwear, I ate a pair for ya
Ooh, now she on a handstand, I'm her number one fan
She the intelligent one, I'm just me with my dumbass
She a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got a lot of ass, but I could work with her

[Chorus]
'Cause she shake it like a dog, hop like a frog
Ride it like a horse, scream and holler 'til she lose her voice
Yeah, she shake it like a dog, hop like a frog
Ride it like a horse, so I ain't got a choice
She pop it like a tart, and stab it like a heart
She sad when we depart, she watching her remarks
And she said, "We gon' ride this shit on out & now we walk"
I said, "Fuckin' right," ooh baby, ooh baby

[Post-Chorus]
'Til she lose her voice, like
She said, "Ignore them hoes, better not"
She said, "Them hoes, better not fuck with my Tunechi
He got a magic stick and know how to use it"
She said, "Them hoes, better not fuck with my Tunechi
He got a magic stick and know how to use it"

[Verse 2]
She a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got a lot of ass, but I could work with her
She a slim, fine woman with some shit with her
She ain't got a lot of ass, but she pretty as fuck
And she can shake it like a dog, shake it like a dog
Shake it like a, now take that dog for a walk
And want you walk it like a serve it, like a, bounce it like a, yeah
Walk it like a, serve it, like a, bounce it like a, yeah
Girl, you know I love you and I care for you
Girl, you know I love you, I go hard for you
It's from the heart
Girl, you got a monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Act a donkey on that dick, Pony on that shit
Let me see you monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Act a donkey on that dick, Pony on that shit

[Chorus 2]
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya
Just ask my bitch about me, I got her a belt vuitton
And this dick is A1, pussy well done
And she said, "Ooh baby, ooh baby"

[Post-Chorus]
'Til she lose her voice, like
She said, "Ignore them hoes, better not"
She said, "Them hoes, then I pop with my Tunechi
He got a magic stick and know how to use it"
She said, "Them hoes, then I pop with my Tunechi
He got a magic stick and know how to use it"
'Til she lose her voice, like, like, like, like
