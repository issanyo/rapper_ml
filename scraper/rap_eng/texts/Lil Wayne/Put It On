[Intro: Kat DeLuna]
GMB, put 'em on
J [?], put 'em on
Kat DeLuna, put 'em on

[Verse 1: Kat DeLuna]
I does this well, put 'em on
In my YSL, put 'em on
Like you couldn't tell, put 'em on
Marc Jacobs swag, put 'em on
With a new Louis bag, put 'em on
I'mma show you where it's at, put 'em on
You wanna walk like Kat, put 'em on
KTL shoes, put 'em on

[Hook: Kat DeLuna]
What they gon' say, about me?
It's all about me 'cause I'm hot
Your time is over 'cause you're not
The world is looking at me
I'll give em something to see
And when they lookin' at you
Show them what you can do
This shit is hot, put it on
This shit is hot, put it on
This shit is hot, put it on
This shit is hot, put it on

[Verse 2: Kat DeLuna]
Them flashing lights, put 'em on
[?], put 'em on
International, put 'em on
'Cause I'm the shit, put 'em on
Roll your laundry, put it on
I love this beat, put it on
You can hear it in the streets, put it on
DJs in the club, put it on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I'm so me
And those who don't know shit, know me
And I'm so neat
Baby girl the runway is my street
Shoes so murder they kill my feet
Marc Jacobs sneakers, how can I sneak?
Damier, Damier
I been had dough, you're kinda late
Louis purse, Louis scarf
I make her take that Louis off
Yeah, ask about me
Middle finger to the fashion police
It's Weezy!
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for fashion

[Hook]
