[Verse 1: Juvenile]
I be comin' up wit da Glock toy
You can stop boy
You ain't heard I'm off tha block boy
Chipp-pedy chop boy
Off in ya cut is where I'm layin'
Ready fo' sprayin'
Soon as I see yo face and hand
I ain't wit dat playin'
My daddy showed me how to play it in a situation
My daddy tol' me I ain't shit wit outta occupation
So I played the game
Bust yo head if you said my name
I had some of deez niggas scared I came
I kno' some niggas out tha 'Nolia that'll ride fo' me
I kno' some niggas hollin' soldier that a die fo' me
T.C., L.T., Magnolia and six
Oh you want some of dat fire dope you can score in da bricks
You disrespectin' my mind cuz you keep comin' short
I might hitcha wit dat iron cuz you need ta be taught
You keep showing yo teeth cuz you thank its a joke
You mus thank deez bullets ain't real and you ain't gon' git smoke

[Chorus: Juvenile & Lil Wayne]
Now if ya at dat second line and dem boyz gotta gun
You betta run for it, run for it, run
And if ya too deep in some beef and dem boyz bout ta come
You betta run for it, run for it, run
If ya ain't gotta strap but cho enemy got one
You betta run for it, run for it, run
And if you git into it wit a Cash Money Brotha
You betta run for it, run for it, run

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I be in all black sometimes
Sometimes I be jumpin' out trees in camouflage
Me and Juvenile got two Ks we bout to ride
Dem boyz playin' wit da U.P.T. well dey gots to die
Man it's that deep
It's a tragedy
That you can test me
Heard I run in houses don't put it past me
Hell look boy you betta tell deez niggas
Fo' I mask up and try ta kill deez niggas
You don't want my stress trouble
I be back in two hummers and five lex-bubbles (what!)
My big brother Juvie
Tol' me not to eva letta nigga screw me
Tol' me if I eva did he would do me
Gave me two guns and sent me round dey shootin'
And then they start runnin'
Hardest niggas on tha block started actin like a woman
Tha four foot stranger in ya area bustin'
Load it up and slide it in
Cock it back pop it out we ridin'
Look, look I'll run in a busta spot
I'll sit on a busta porch
I'll sleep on a busta block
Apply five and then let go
Bang lil cowards keep playin', get hurt
Motha-flirk see I'ont' curse
But'll wet up yo shirt
Look all my enemy's see me comin'
All my enemy's peeeeeuuungghhh be runnin'

[Chorus: Juvenile & Lil Wayne]
Now if ya at dat second line and dem boyz gotta gun
You betta run for it, run for it, run
And if ya too deep in some beef and dem boyz bout ta come
You betta run for it, run for it, run
If ya ain't gotta strap but cho enemy got one
You betta run for it, run for it, run
And if you git into it wit a Cash Money Brotha
You betta run for it, run for it, run

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
You thank I'm playin'a somthin' lil whodie I ain't trippin'
Tha beef started last week and dem niggas still be hittin'
Two children got killed and a ol' lady got hit
Look I'm bout ta git tha fuck cause I ain' got no time fo' dis shit
Now you can be comin' through
And runnin' to a gun if you feel
That they ain't gon' do you shit cause ya real
I'ont' wanna be witcha when its hapnin' either
I probably be somewhere ducked off takin' a nap wit my people
I'd rather see it on TV than see it in person
Having my fucking' head hurtin'
When dem thirties be burstin'
Bet if yo beef see ya he ain't gon' wait fo' ya dog
Our all gon' try to rearrange ya face fo' ya dog
Second line and round dem clubs ain't no place fo ya dog
Dem same niggas you come up wit playa-hatin' ya dog
I see em comin' wit choppers and I know they gon' bust
Lil Wayne hol' up
We kitin' out sho' nuff'

[Chorus: Juvenile & Lil Wayne]
Now if ya at dat second line and dem boyz gotta gun
You betta run for it, run for it, run
And if ya too deep in some beef and dem boyz bout ta come
You betta run for it, run for it, run
If ya ain't gotta strap but cho enemy got one
You betta run for it, run for it, run
And if you git into it wit a Cash Money Brotha
You betta run for it, run for it, run
Now if ya at dat second line and dem boyz gotta gun
You betta run for it, run for it, run
And if ya too deep in some beef and dem boyz bout ta come
You betta run for it, run for it, run
If ya ain't gotta strap but cho enemy got one
You betta run for it, run for it, run
And if you git into it wit a Cash Money Brotha
You betta run for it, run for it, run

[Outro: Juvenile]
Run for it
Ya betta run for it, run for it
Ya betta run for it, run for it
Go git cha gun for it
Ya betta run for it, run for it, run
Run for it, run for it, run, run for it
Run for it, run, run for it, run for it, run
Get cha gun for it , gun for it, gun
Get cha gun for it gun for it
