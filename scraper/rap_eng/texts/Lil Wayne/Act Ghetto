[Chorus: Tyga]
She just wanna act ghetto
She just wanna dance like a stripper, rap like a nigga
She just wanna rub her titties, pop her ass (pop her ass)
She just wanna act ghetto when the cameras flash
She just wanna act ghetto
She just wanna act ghetto
She just wanna dance like a stripper, rap like a nigga
She just wanna rub her titties, pop her ass (pop her ass)
She just wanna act ghetto when the cameras flash
She just wanna act ghetto, act ghetto, act ghetto, act ghetto

[Verse 1: Tyga]
She wear diamond on her pussy, diamonds on neck, yeah, ih
Talkin' out her neck? Demand respect, ooh
Yeah, she wanna act ghetto, gettin' drunk on the set
Gonna drink it out the bottle, flip the finger when she rep'
Fuck it when she dance, touch it when she dance
Feelin' on her friends, do it for the 'gram, woo
Yeah, she wanna hold a nigga hand, kiss a nigga face
All up in the line, at McDonald's, yeah, she just wanna shake

[Pre-Chorus: Tyga]
She wanna do it (she wanna do it), she wanna do it (she wanna do it)
She wanna stunt like Rihanna, might make me wear Puma
Gettin' checks like Kylie, yeah, everyday I do it, yeah
Yesterday, I did it, every time I'm with her

[Chorus: Tyga]
She just wanna act ghetto
She just wanna dance like a stripper, rap like a nigga
She just wanna rub her titties, pop her ass (pop her ass)
She just wanna act ghetto when the cameras flash
She just wanna act ghetto
She just wanna act ghetto
She just wanna dance like a stripper, rap like a nigga
She just wanna rub her titties, pop her ass (pop her ass)
She just wanna act ghetto when the cameras flash
She just wanna act ghetto, act ghetto, act ghetto, act ghetto

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
She just wanna get her booty done
And she give me head while she chewin' gum
Ghetto fabulous, she so booty-ful
She ain't got home trainin', she got Uber though
She just text me O-M-W with two XOs
Only thing she always comin' through is project hoes
Gotta put my jewelry up, gotta hide that dough
All I know is pussy hoes and Pyrex hoes
Woah, oh shit, oh shit, I'm so Hollygrove
Yellow bone suck my glow stick, now she got that glow
Olympic gold squad, we keep that metal
And them birds, she ain't sleepin' feather, she just ghetto, ooh

[Chorus: Tyga, Lil Wayne, Both]

[Verse 3: Tyga]
She wanna jump in a Jacuzzi, jump in a Ferrari, yeah
Suckin' on a lolly, ride on my Ducati (Skrrt)
Stumblin' through the lobby, pullin' off her dress, woah
Wanna change off them heels, throw off the sweats, mmm
I love when her hair in a bun (Bun)
Honey-bun pussy on my tongue (tongue, tongue, tongue)
Smackin' on her ass, smackin' on her gum
Countin' all this cash, cuttin' up my thumb

[Pre-Chorus: Tyga]
She wanna do it (she wanna do it), she wanna do it (she wanna do it)
She wanna stunt like Rihanna, cut her hair, tat her body
Keep it thug in her life, this why I always keep her by me, yeah
Every time she by me, every time we ride
