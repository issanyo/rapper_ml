[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Yeah
OK, I walk up in the club
Louies with the cherry bottoms
Bad bitch on my arm
With a Halle Berry body
You know what I do, I
Get straight to the mula
Wrist wear frigid
And my watch is a Franck Muller
I’m reppin’ Young Mula
Gudda times two, I
Remember when I used to
Stuff my paper in my shoe box
Now I got two large accounts
Where money stacks in large amounts
What the fuck you niggas talking 'bout
Cause we ain’t tryin' to talk it out
Pistol hangin’ out my jeans
It ain’t a thing
Lets spark it out
Let that chopper start to sing
And let it ring
And then I’m out
Yeah, you know what I’m sippin’
Purple got me trippin’
Scoop your chicken up
And let her lick me like a lizard
I’m on South Beach chillin’
And I’m tryin’ to fuck every hottie
Get her to the crib
And make her fuck everybody
You know the team
It’s Young Money over everybody
In the rap game
So it’s "Fuck everybody"

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Married to the MOB
Bury you alive
My girl pussy feel like
Heaven to a God
And I came in this bitch with my niggas
Kidnap the baby and the fuckin’ babysitter
Yeah
I be doing me
Don’t give a fuck 'bout what you doing
Blood gang, bitch
Big B’s, Boston Bruins
I could do this shit eyes closed
Nothin’ to it
Bullets fuck your body up
They ain’t even tryna view it
I go tough, I go stupid
Murk your pussy ass
And everyone you in cahoots with
Fuck you with a pool stick
Make you swallow tooth picks
Fuckin’ right we ruthless
We done watched too many movies
Done smoked too many doobies
Murk you out, then deuces
We don’t know what truce is
That bullet proof vest so useless
Flag red like bruises
Shoot at ya head with them Uzis
I swear, your honor
I ain’t a dealer, I’m a user
Ya dig?
I load up the Sig
Point it at ya wig
Pull over on the highway
Throw you off the bridge
We don’t give a fuck
And we ain’t never did
Shit, three words you never hear
"Let him live"
I’m in my own zone
It got me throwed off
I break these bitches down
I break these hoes off
Lil Tunechi is my name
I got Gudda on the tape
Public apology
Sorry For The Wait
Yeah
