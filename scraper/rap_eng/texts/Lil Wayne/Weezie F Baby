(Intro)
Uh Yea, Oh Yea
Trin' Bein I've Got Ya
Yea I'm On That Syzurp my
Ya Off Tha HOOK
Hey! Heyyy!

Go by the name of Weezie F
AnD, I'M WALKING out the belly store with ten bags?
Fly as a mutha fucka girly on my staple
Cause her friends say I'm a tummy sucker
Don't go below the navel
I'm up in Lil Hatti
I'm blowin on Jamaica
I'm in the pimp a beemer
I'm with a salt shaker
Now I'm in DADE County
I see some thick bitches
I try to holla at em
But they all trick bitches
I think Trina sexy
MamI ya wine fine
And on the hush hush
We need some quiet time
Yea I'm a RIDE ma
The Birdman's boy
He OWNS CA$H MONEY
I PRE-OWN CA$H MONEY?
Yea and I put her on CA$H MONEY
She start wobblin that ass for me
She start modelin
She see the models in the Maybach
She call me Weezie F. Baby
And she make sure she say that

(Chorus)
(Lil Wayne)
See a fly nigga baby yea I don't trip
Just give em lil THIGH
Mama give em lil hip
(Trina)
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips
(Lil Wayne)
Give em lil THIGH
Mama give em lil hip
Then you give em Lil' WIND-UP
Give em a lil DIP
(Trina)
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips

Now I'm the daughter of a madam
Inside of a pink phantom
If ya man got that cash
Then best believe I met him
Cause I'm sharp as a machete
And I cuss like CRAZY
Niggas call me Betty Crocker
Cause my cakes stay plenty
Got stacks on top of stacks
I'M COPPIN' A MEAL TICKET
No matter the consequence
My emphasis is to get it
It's Trina Weezie F. Baby
MANNY HANDLE the scripts
It's all reminiscent to
Gladys KNIGHT AND the PIPS
All my niggas jump around
Girls jump on that dick
It ain't gonna be no standin around
Now lets get crunk in this bitch
And ladies
Show em yo shit
A lil hip a lil THIGH
More pressure for the eye
And the more a nigga try
You can find me stretched out
In my 850i
Or my big 600
Believe Trina done it
Believe I'M diamond studded
Stay flooded like a damn
Chase GRANDS cause I am what I am
Don't give a damn
Go

(Chorus)
Back to the lesson at hand
Stick to my plan
When it comes to seein man after man
Don't give a damn about his car or his GRANDS
Wh Wh WhWhat
Cause I'm gonna make my on ends
That's WhWhat's up
Ladies lets say you want a man
But don't kno how to do it
Dirty dance with em
Put a lil back into it
GO CATCH A wall shorty
End up at the mall sporty
Try to dog waddy?
Make em spend it all on ya
Yep and make that nigga ball for ya
Then have him beggin for that kitty kat
Wining and dining for that ass
Give him none of that
Just let him know
Say make a bitch rich
Cause the badest bitch taught you that

(Chorus)
