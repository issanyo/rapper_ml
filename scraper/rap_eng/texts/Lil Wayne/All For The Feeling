[Verse 1]
Uh, too many handshakes given
Too many prayers for forgiveness
Too many smiles when you hurtin'
Too many thoughts on your mind
All the time, got you nervous
And you always read your horoscope
Tryna figure if the nigga that you talkin' to the one
And your friends say no, dealership say no
But fuck it you got a body that'll pay the car note
Thirty percent for the down payment
Pull out the lot girl now you famous
You on your own and your'e doin' just fine
Every check stub wanna buy you time

[Bridge 1]
It ain't hard when you feel it
Cause' when you feel it you kill it
Your pride gone now you willin'
Tell the world they in danger
Even tell a stranger

[Chorus 1]
You all for the feeling
You all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
You all for the feeling
And you ain't never walked away from that feeling

[Verse 2]
Take a breath and say something
Go on ahead, talk about it
Money over discussion
Make a little something out of nothing
And all these promises, they all bluffing
Water the seed till the soils muddy
Uh, and every holiday you work
And when I have time you be at work
Damn, I guess your looking for better
But I'm digging in that pussy like i'm lookin' for a treasure
And the feeling don't die if you don't let it, but you don't let it
That's why I give you credit, and today my lucky day
Today she doin' nothing, so when we get together
I put it in her stomach she say

[Bridge 2]
Tunechi I feel it
She feel it when I kill it
Her pride gone now she willing
Tell the world they in danger
Even tell a stranger

[Chorus 2]
That it's all for the feeling
Say it's all for the feeling
Yeah you all for the feeling
You all for the feeling
And you ain't never walked away from that feeling

[Verse 3]
Take a breath and say something
Go on ahead, talk about the weeks
Talk about the months, talk about the pussy niggas
Man they all punks, live for the moment
Life ain't fair, sorry for the feeling
No grey hair, you ain't worried about nothing
Turn nothing into something
And never let that go

[Bridge 3]
Tell the world they in danger
Even tell a stranger

[Chorus 3]
You all for the feeling
Yeah you all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
God willing
You never walk away from that feeling
You all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
Keep your head to the ceiling
Kill it when you feel it
Cause' you all for the feeling

[Outro]
Take a breath and say something
Girl lets talk about it
Mmm, yeah
But you ain't gotta say nothing
Because, your eyes say everything
They asked me why I did it
And I told em' it was all for the feeling
