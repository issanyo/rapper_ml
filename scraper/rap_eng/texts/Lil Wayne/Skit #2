What’s up though?
Yeah, this is No Ceilings
I’m really hoping that you’re enjoying what you’re experiencing
What you’re hearing, what your listening to
Once again, thank you for listening to this, thank you for experiencing this
Again, this is No Ceilings
I would love for you to look up into the building and understand that there is no ceilings
There’s only the sky, and the sky is the limit
Christopher Wallace said that
In the background I got Shannel banging right now, you know just vibing out
Real grown and sexy right now – do people still say that? Grown and sexy? I say it so fuck it
This is No Ceilings, and uhm I ain’t gonna do too much talking like I said
I just wanted to check in with you and make sure you was enjoying what you was doing
And uh, thank you for everything
I’m out, No Ceilings!
