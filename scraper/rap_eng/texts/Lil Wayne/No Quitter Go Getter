[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Michael Phelps this for you baby

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I’m goin’ for the gold
My heart is in control, my mind is on succeed
And I am in the lead
Don’t buy into the schemes
The science or stratege
Just giant N-U-T’s brings triumph and relief
I’m reliant on redeem, inspired by the green
Never tieing off of fatigue, never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing until I’m lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things I’m a die as a king
If I don’t do it now I’m a try it again
And when I do accomplish it
I’m a try it again, I’m a riot insane
I’m a lion my mane hangs down to my strings
And they’re tied to the game, I stay dry when it rain
I’m tried of the fame
Got everything to gain and I’m proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane besides we’re the same
Whose guiding the train, whose flyin’ the plane
Whose drivin’ the lane
Who dies when it bang, who fires when it bang
Who lies in the aim
Two lives in the drain, who cries when they sang
You hide but you can’t, you hide but you ain’t
I advise you to thank, you’ll find what you can’t
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Super-size what you shrank, the fries and the drank
Admired as a saint, defined by my rank, combined with my strength
My time and my length, I’m a iron out the kinks, yes I’m on the brink
And in the eye of a wink, I’m a retire in the bank yeeaahhh

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
No I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeaaahhhh I, I’m gon’ get it, I, I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it yeeaahhh
Cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Sshh, victory consistantly
Train all year to be the enemy’s misery
No stress visibly, neither does it enter me
I think positively
You can’t harm me mentally
Not physically, not spiritually
You’ll never get rid of me
I am the epitome of this is what you did to me
Nothin’s what you did for me, nothin’s what you give to me
I take whatever I’m visualing
Now break all of the limiting, now shake all of the gimicking
The fakery, the trickery, nurse how sick is he, worse I’m sickening
I’ll be at the finish line first
How quick is he, I’ma make sure they mention me for the next century
I ain’t with the bickering, I’m full of dignity, I’m full of energy
Pull out the inner me or bull after dinner meat
I stood in the winter heat, it could be the end of me, but good be defending me yeeeaaahhh

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
And I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeaahhh I’m allergic to cheatin’
I hate failure and I’m in love with achievement
Above and beneath it
A hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize
And I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin’ begun with the preachin’
Now pray until I am one with the deacon
Now play until I have won whatever we win
I play until I have won and then I re-win, yeeeaaahhhh

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter
I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it yeah
And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter
I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter
I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
And I’m no quitterrrrr
