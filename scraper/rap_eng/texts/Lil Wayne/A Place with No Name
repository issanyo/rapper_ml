[Verse 1]
As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, then got out, and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find, what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down, toward the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name

[Verse 2]
As she took me right through the fog
I saw a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playing and people are laughing and smiling and nothing to fear
She says this is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness
She turned around, looked down in my eyes, and started crying, and grabbed my hand, you've got a friend

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name

[Verse 3]
She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen, and things I've never done, it really looked like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds, and the flowers, surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness, how in the world, could I wanna leave

So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought, you could be in another world

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name
