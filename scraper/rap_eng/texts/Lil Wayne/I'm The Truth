[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

Bitch I'm the truth! and I would I lie?
I walk up in this bitch like a pilot I'm fly (I'm Fly!)
Hello and bye-bye
I leave ya'll ass in the past like tie-dye (heheh)
3 blunts and a mai-tai
And I am so well connected like Wi-Fi (Haheh)
Me real dread dem dey sci-fi
And I murder Bill Nuy The science Guy

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

I! Do what I do and I do it well
I'm a OG bitch! Can't you spell?
Fuck wrong witch ya'll?
I ain't Marvin Gay, but I can get it on witch ya'll!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

Yea
When I rap my nigga it's so eassyy
That girl so thick she remind me of Suziee
I'm cool but heater like a jacuzi
I'm the size of a mountain so bitch you can't movve me!
Look homie you not even on my level
When it comes to battle MC's son I kill several
I get more blow than a tea kettle
Tell your girl come and suck my dick and than we settle

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

I do what I do and I do it well
I'm a OG bitch can't you spell? (Ha!)
Fuck wrong witch ya'll?
I ain't Marvin Gay, but I can get it on witch ya'll (Yea!)

Verse 3: Lil Wayne]

Microphone Ch-ecker no liquor (Ow!)
Just pain killers and prometha - young echas! (Heh)
Jumpin' the gas like checkers you can't check us
Or we all in your face like freckles - trunk speckle
Big shark talk I swim when and wheneva
I walk with a fork in my poket salt and pepper
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
And if you don't believe me than leave me be (Haha!)

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne]

I am not human I am just an illusion
Organized confusion amusing (Ha!)
I am not losing I am one of the chosen
"School Of The Hard Knocks" I am just a student
