[Verse 1]
Swagger in place, now let me get to it
I'm badder than your nigga and the niggas next to him
I do me, bitch, what are you doin'?
Teardrop Tune got you bitches boohooin'
Weezy F. Baby ga-ga-goo-gooin'
And girl, I swear, if you start chewin', I'm suin'
Ha ha, yeah, and to the paper I'm gluin'
And my trunk ain't big but big enough to fit you in
Have your people like "Where the hell you went?"
They find your ass with everything but movement
And money talks and I speak it fluent
And I keep them tools so don't be screwin'
Around uptown, in this bitch like "Oh, wait"
Young Money on the grind, no off-days
Young Money got cheese like Hog Head
Now lay it down just like MJG and Ball said, yeah (hmm hmm)

[Bridge]
And I'm... I'm so hard-bodied
So... now I'm so hard-bodied
What you niggas wan' do?
That's a big difference from what you're gon' do, yeah (ha ha)
Spotlight on you, yeah (ha ha)

[Hook]
Hol' up, lemme fix my hat
Hol' up, hol' up, lemme fix my hat (fix my hat)
Hol' up (hol' up), lemme fix my hat
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, my hat, my hat
Hol' up (hol' up), lemme fix my Gat
Hol' up (hol' up, hol' up), lemme fix my Gat, my Gat
Hol' up, lemme fix my Gat
Hol' up, hol' up, lemme... (hmm hmm)

[Verse 2]
My brother Marley G said you boys ain't shit
You can't name a bad bitch that the boy ain't wit'
Same bad bitch that the boy came with
Same bad bitch that you boys can't get
I'd be god damned if the Marl ain't hit
Take your girl and straight sprawl that bitch
You know my niggas? Yeah, I give them all that bitch
Then drop her ass off and never call that bitch
Ya dig? My brother Mack Maine taught me that
I swear it's like the nigga wrote the game, Almanac
Dude, how could you even want her back?
And just in case I forget my name I made her get it on her back, yeah

[Hook]
Well hol' up, lemme fix my hat
Hol' up, hol' up, lemme fix my hat (fix my hat)
Hol' up, lemme fix my hat
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, my hat, my hat
Hol' up (hol' up), lemme fix my Gat
Hol' up (hol' up, hol' up), lemme fix my Gat, my Gat
Hol' up, lemme fix my Gat
Hol' up, hol' up, lemme... (hmm hmm)

[Verse 3]
Holly Grove animal, come on, try to tame me
Tell your Ma I'm bad and tell your Grandma I'm dangerous
Tell your Pa he pussy, tell your brother he a bitch
"I'm on ya mark, set, go" running this shit
I'm thuggin' this bitch on some rock and roll shit
Need calamine lotion, see, my pockets swole, bitch
And they wonder why I sing and changed all my outfits
'Cause all y'all rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit
I'ma ball out, bitch and, boy, I wish
All y'all assholes get off my dick, pause
New Orleans 'til I die
Second Line, Second Life tambourines in the sky

[Hook]
Lemme fix my hat
Hol' up, hol' up, lemme fix my hat (fix my hat)
Hol' up, lemme fix my hat
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, my hat, my hat
Hol' up (hol' up), lemme fix my Gat
Hol' up (hol' up, hol' up), lemme fix my Gat, my Gat
Hol' up, lemme fix my Gat
Hol' up, hol' up, lemme... (hmm hmm)
