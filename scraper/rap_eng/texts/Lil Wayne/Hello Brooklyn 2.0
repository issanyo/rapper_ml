Hello Brooklyn!

[Chorus]
Hello Brooklyn how you doing
Where you going and can I come too
And if I can I'ma be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
And drive my car and drive me crazy
Wherever your going baby girl just take me
Cause I'm so taken if you taken
I'm just saying baby I'm just saying

Like a mamma you birthed me, Brooklyn you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Burkley
They say you murked me by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'ma call her, Brooklyn carter
When I left you for Virginia it didn't offend ya
Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eating, so much I bought extra
So much so that dinners now turned into breakfast
I only roll Lexus to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul
Hello Brooklyn

[Chorus]
Hello Brooklyn

Whats your story, she said she's eating on the run but she ain't Nore
She said she's got a man but he ain't worried
But baby I'ma have to rob him like Orie
She said she love B.I.G. and she likes 2Pac
And when I said Jay-Z she said it's the Roc
I'ma leave it like this like this like that
Where Brooklyn at, where Brooklyn at
Have you seen her, and when she tell you something you better believe her
She told me she like my new Orleans demeanor
And so I said goodbye Katrina and hello Brooklyn

But baby you are the sweetest site eyes could see
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby you are so damn fine to me
And I remember the time, place and the weather from the day you said hi to me
And I say hello Brooklyn

Brooklyn you crazy look how you made me
Razor blades in my mouth walking 'round behaving
Or demented black hoodies and timberland'd
Always scheming you see the gleam on that niggas pendant
Hello Brooklyn, you bad influence
Look what you had me doing
But I ain't mad at you, look at my attitude it says my life's too real
Check out my ice grill baby I'm cold as ice
I come from Brownsville but my "beds in the 'stye"
Blow la la "flatten your bush" till we smoking c.i
What up to the boy d.i. you know I handle B.I
I don't half step on the 'caine, ask the dreads 'bout I
How you want it slow she like it hard cold
So I grind slow iller than out in square mall back in the 9-0
My fine hoe we got some victims to catch
So in a couple years baby I'ma bring you some next

[Chorus]
But baby you are the sweetest site eyes could see
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby you are so damn fine to me
And I remember the time, place and the weather from the day you said hi to me
And I say hello Brooklyn
