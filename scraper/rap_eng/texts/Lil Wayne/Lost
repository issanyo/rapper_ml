Walkin' around lookin' for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
A labyrinth, a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walkin' in bampers
Give me a cigarette
Smokin' my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

I'm Lost on a road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
& I'm swervin'
On & off the road
I'm Lost on a road
But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm livin' in a rush
I don't understand this fuss
My brain is about to bust

I think I'm losin' it
I might be losin' it
I just might lose
Am I losin' my mind?
& I'm so confused I don't know what to do
& I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losin' it?
Am I losin' it?
I think I'm losin'
I'm losin' my mind
Am I losin' it?
Am I losin' it?
I think I'm losin'
I'm losin' my mind

I call up my girlfriend
She doesn't answer
I hit the strip club & fuck wit a dancer
Throwin' my one's up
I go pay in ransom
Told me I look good
She said I was handsome
So I believed her
'Cause I am lonely
I'm just a loner
My life is a movie
Tonight we're just actors
& this is a sin comes
So Tell me you love me
Tell me I'll get some

I'm Lost on a road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
& I'm swervin'
On & off the road
I'm Lost on a road
But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm livin' in a rush
I don't understand this fuss
My brain is about to bust

I think I'm losin' it
I might be losin' it
I just might lose
Am I losin' my mind?
& I'm so confused I don't know what to do
& I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losin' it?
Am I losin' it?
I think I'm losin'
I'm losin' my mind
Am I losin' it?
Am I losin' it?
I think I'm losin'
I'm losin' my mind

I'm makin' this money
Just to go spend it
Livin' the good life
Hope nobody ends it
But who are you kiddin'?
Hey who are you lyin' to?
You know if they want you
Best believe they will find you

I'm Lost on a road
& there's no one to talk to
There's nowhere to run to
I'm goin' in circles
I'm talkin' to myself
It Got me blazin' this purple

I think I'm losin' it
I might be losin' it
I just might lose
Am I losin' my mind?
& I'm so confused I don't know what to do
& I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losin' it?
Am I losin' it?
I think I'm losin'
I'm losin' my mind
Am I losin' it?
Am I losin' it?
I think I'm losin'
I'm losin' my mind

I'm Lost on a road

I'm Lost on a road

I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
& I'm swervin'
On & off the road

I'm losing my mind
