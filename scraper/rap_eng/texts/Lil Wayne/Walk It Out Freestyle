[Verse One]
Look, I bought it out like stunna
I hope when we kiss we make you sick to your stomach
Stuntin' like my daddy and yo momma eat rubbers
I bet that I can do the mouth to mouth with your woman
My house is a dungeon
Yellow diamond ring looking like a little Funyun
Stand on my toes you can call me Paul Bunyan
Touchin up my flows like a nigga do construction
The microphone wet cause my words like seduction
And when we on the jet you don't come up in our discussion
And if you say you ballin we probably don't trust ya
And I know plenty freaky hoes that probably won't fuck ya
Even if you payin boy they probably won't fuck ya
Only if I say that she can touch you like Busta
But she might touch ya and burn you like Usher
Me and my clique be in red like Russia
I shit these rappers out and sometimes I forget to flush ya
Grand daddy purp or Bubba kush crush ya
Explode in a bitch mouth like a Gusher
Cash Money, Young Money, check the production
I am just a Martian prepared for abduction

[Laughs x2]

[Verse Two]
I walk it out like crutches
Two girls jumped me like double dutches
My nigga T-Street know a girl name Dutchess
And every time he see her in the street she be cussin'
I told him he should wave the black flag cause she buggin'
He said the pussy good he said "Ya dig?" so I dug 'em
I'm looking for a real bad bitch with a husband
I give her much dick and a whole lot of nothing
I'm spittin like I stumbled on a gold pot or something
And when I was six I saw my role model hustlin
So I gotta hustle
These rappers talkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothin
You drive me out on Saturday, I sold out on Sunday
Fuck is the argue 'bout, nigga Tha Carter out
This is what I call a drought.. 3
And we don't walk it out, we drop top Porsche it out
They better walk 'em out, before we chalk 'em out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we choke 'em out
They don't want it nah-uh
No they don't want it nah-uh
You see they phony I'm not
Oh yeah they phony I'm not
I Eastside walk it out, I bring New Orleans out
I am a Saints fan, oh yeah we marchin' now
Like we're a saints band, I play the organs now
And if they talkin' most likely I'm what they talkin' 'bout
My nigga T from the East roll up that forest now
Man I'm just trying to get my peanuts I'm like Charlie Brown
Ok that Uzi make the holy sound, take two of these and walk around
Come straight from the homeless town, this game belong to Carter now, bitch
