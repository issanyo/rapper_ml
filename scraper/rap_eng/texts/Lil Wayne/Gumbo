Flyest niggas from the city, bitch, that's really us (geah!)
You pussies talking, boo! boo! boo!, now you really fucked
Ridin' in the range with Maine, we switch lanes (Maine!)

Take a shot at me over a beat, bitch, I'ma shoot you
Got a bitch named Vicky, she pretty, she keep me stiffy
Glock .40 in her purse, don't tempt me, her finger itchy (ayy)
She ride so I keep her with me, she shy but not with that glizzy
She high from hittin' the blizzy, eyes red like Trippie (Trippie!)
Hoody rollin' up, that boy smoke like a hippie (hippie!)
Fill my double cup up with mud, that's right, I'm sipping
