[Intro]
Listen up, Princess

[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning
Take a knee and thank God
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eye
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Neither the day before that, nor before that
I just remember the moments, call me Kodak
And know that I do miss ya
But it's your denial that I must hold against ya
Since you've been gone, I've been all alone
But alone is steroids, cuz it made me strong
Girl, hurr gone in the wind
You cheated on God's son
Baby girl, that's a sin
But I forgive you
But I can't give you
Another chance, ma, you're in my rear-view
And I put that ring on your finger
I was all in
But now it's just a symbol of what could've been
Goddamn

[Bridge]
And now I'm by myself, but (I like it)
Damn, she left me all by myself, but (I like it)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I love my niggas; no homo
I swear I hope all get cheese like Digiorno
It's something 'bout the Hot Boyz that you don't know
I gotta love for em that I don't show
And B.G. been my nigga since the front door
I hope Chopper City Records blow
Fa sho'
And me and Juve never really got along
But you still would let yo nigga come get on yo hottest song
Damn, I fuck wit ya for that
I fuck with ya Lil Wack
And me and Skip go back (Skip, whattup!)
When you see a real nigga, you gotta tip yo hat
And since I'm a real nigga, I do just that
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case
After I heard him dissin me on the mixtape
Cause he's locked up, and I'm free
He got a lot more to worry about than me
I ain't trippin

[Outro]
Y'all niggas left me by myself, but I can't front (I like it)
And so, now
I've become the President of the spot y'all left me at
A lot has changed, but, I can't font (I like it)
