Catch me if you can when I'm dipping from the cops
Catch me, catch me if you can when I'm dipping from the cops
Catch me, catch me if you can when I'm dipping from the cops
Catch me, catch me if you can when I'm, catch me if you can when I'm
Catch me if you can when I'm dipping from the cops
Catch me, catch me if you can when I'm dipping from the cops
Catch me, catch me if you can when I'm dipping from the cops
Catch me, catch me if you can when I'm, catch me if you can when I'm

[Verse 1: Jody Breeze]
I'm On The Interstate
In The Chevrolet
In The 55
Going 78
On 285
Just passed 78
With a loaded nine
Smoking on some mary j
Bitch I'm on the grind
I hustle every day
Pound for pound
Call me a heavyweight
Round for round
Nigga I don't hesitate
I'm doing real estate
Trying to get my business straight
God is going down
On my license plate
Cause it's going down
So get out the way
Time to separate
The real from the fake
So I'mma demonstrate
What y'all imitate
And that's whipping cakes
Cause Nigga I'm good at it
I don't talk much
I'm from the hood daddy
See this virgin I ain't worried about the police
Cause I'm a mad shot
They already know me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm coming around the loop
I'm in the Bentley Coupe
In the 35
Doing 22
Don't honk your horn
Don't flash your lights
Cause me and Jody passing blunts like we pass the mic
I'm after nice
D.A's after me
Bitch I'm a boss
I can increase your salary
Locked up in ATL
For getting blunted
Straight out of Fulton County
To Magic City Mondays
Blowing money, throwing money
It's snowing money
These bitches should lay down and make a snow angel
Let the bitch suck my dick
Now her throat famous
Long paper
Short gangster
Short vanquish
And I can speak everything
Except court language
Snitches die ugly
So I forbid the
And tell them pigs come and get me!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jody Breeze]
Four 50 four up under the hood with the Hemi in it
Guarantee you're gonna hear me before you see me in it
And when you see me still can't see me, my windows tinted
I'm a menace, yeah I admit it, but I still got the digits
Waited till I'm out of business
Bend it like acrobatics
Boy, better mind your business
We strapped with the automatics
It's about who paper stacking
Not about who act the baddest
Grams, I'm packing Lincolns
I'm good with the mathematics
I got a kilo on me
I'm going to see the homies
Knowing if I get caught
That I'm going to see Big Coney
I'm going all out
Never hustle scary
I'm a thoroughbred
Not your ordinary
Bless my hustle berries
Strictly about my cash
If I really need it
I'mma wear a mask
Couple hundred slabs
In the paper bag
And if we see the cops, fuck it, dipping on they ass
