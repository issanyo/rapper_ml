It's A Major Move Right Here Baby
Got Get Ready To Get Lost You Understand...

Money to be made best believe a nigga clockin'
I run it myself like a quarterback option
I pitch 'er ten g's, tell a bitch to go shoppin'
She buy herself some clothes and she brought me back a chopper
See niggas trying to kick it but no I don't play soccer
I'm all about my cake, I'm trying to marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way you know my whip game proper
And off of one ki, I see seventy thousand dollars
Now I was shootin dice, smokin on a joint
I bet with' Yo Gotti he hit five straight points
We over here hustlin, we over here grindin
You rap bout money and a nigga might sign you
Rap bout me and a nigga might find you
Banana in ya ass with ya head right behind ya
Dope game bitch, let his momma worry about him
You can holla at me, a fee!

All I wanna do is (BANG BANG BANG BANG!)
And (KKKAAAA CHING!)
And take your money [x4]
