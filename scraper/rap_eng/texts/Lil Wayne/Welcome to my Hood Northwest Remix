Hook (T-Pain)
Welcome to my Hood
Everybody knows everybody
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my Hood
Look at all these old school Chevvy 24's so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood
And the stop playing hop scotch
And everybody knows this is the hot spot
Weclome to my hood
The boys will put you down on your knees
Woo! Woo! that's the sound of the police
In the hood

Verse 1: Arturo Flowz
Locals only, power to the people
I’m fighting for justice so my friends are treated equal
Fuck the judges and the jury, whole racist system
Put them in jail with the cops and  politicians
I’m talking about the pen put them in that super max
Jailbird clothing and no more driving cadillacs
The government’s the one who imported cocaine
Fuck olliver North, he’s the one to blame
Fake rappers talk about sipping on that lean
The feds always trying to war against that green
I don’t have love for fake politicians
Do the fucking perp walk, put them in prison

Verse 2: Arturo Flowz
Elitists step aside this is a fucking take over
Take a preppy kiss up and give them a make-over
Take money from oppressors, pay the restitution
Put them in jail, that’s my solution
Fuck the United  States, a flag I’m not saluting
Take the oil mafia, jail them for polluting
Lock the paramilitary up at Lemon Creek
Weak ass cowards, these fake fucks are weak
Diversify the school staff, decolonize the school system
If they refuse, you know what we’ll do with them

Verse 3: Arturo Flowz
Next thing we’ll do is take money out of politics
The knowledge of a kūmu, but I’m just a college kid
Tell Jeff Bezos that I don’t play
We know he’s getting cash from the fucking CIA
Westside of Anchorage that is where I stay
Shoutout to my homies every single day
Shoutout to the  homie Fa’aluaina Pritchard
My uncle was a tricky Dick, kind on like Richard
The system is fucked up like Weezy on syrup
I stay home with my homies fuck trips to Europe
Fuck all the cash, we fight for self esteem
The biggest hoax i’ve seen is the American dream
