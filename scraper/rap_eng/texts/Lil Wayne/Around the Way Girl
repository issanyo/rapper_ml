Okay I saw you at the bus stop
You had on a halter top
And your mini skirt
And your Dooney and your Bourke
So I turn around and scooped you
Hit you with that toot toot
Like do you need a ride
Like do you need a ride

Because I know where you're from
You're from where I'm from
And I'm with you girl
I know you girl
I like you girl
I want you and I'm from where you're from
And I'm cool with your mom
And I like you girl
I want you girl
I'm with you girl
I'm for you girl

[Chorus]
You're my around the way girl, oh
You're my around the way girl, oh oh
You're my around the way girl, oh
You're my around the way girl, oh oh

I saw you at the Benz lot
In that new Benz drop
Lookin' at that Benz drop
So I brought you that Benz drop
And now you in that new coupe
Hit me with that toot toot
Like girl I need a ride
Like girl I need a ride

Because you know where I'm from
I'm from where you're from
And I'm with ya girl
I know you girl
I like you
I want you and you're from where I'm from
And your cool with my mom
And I know you
I like you
I'm with you
I'm for you girl

[Chorus]
You're my around the way girl, oh
You're my around the way girl, oh oh
You're my around the way girl, oh
You're my around the way girl, oh oh
