All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world

(I just want to be your man girl
So uh, gotta make you understand girl)
It's the way you flip your hair
And those stylish clothes you wear
When you walk into the room
All my partners stopped and stared at you
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
But they just want to use you up
(All around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
It's the tattoo on your back
And that brand new Louis bag
With the matchin' high heels
I can't help this girl's swag's the truth
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
And I just want to give her love, oh
(All around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)

(Girl I) can't get you off my mind
You're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on
And rock you all night long 'cause I (oh I)
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
I just want to be your man (I just want to be your man)
(All around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)

Just to smell your perfume, got me throwin' up my hands
See you comin' see you goin', never met someone as bad as you
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
Since you're my favorite girl, yeah
(All around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
I know just what you need, to make you look complete
This platinum wedding ring, 'cause soon I got a thing for you
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
I'm a take you around the world, oh baby
(All around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)

(Girl I) can't get you off my mind
You're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on
And rock you all night long 'cause I (oh I)
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
I just want to be your man
(All around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)

(Ah hah hah, yeah)
OK I'm thinkin' of a master plan
Nah, I'm lyin', shorty on my mind
Shorty like a fryin', pan, and I ain't got
Nothin' but sweat inside my hands
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
But I don't need a cent, 'cause shorty priceless
I tell it like this, I been (all around the world)
So baby I can take you (all around the world)
I roll up, this is a hold up
It's young money man, shorty made me smile
When ain't a damn thing funny
He heh, but still don't nothin' move but the money
So baby if I move then we move with the money
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
Which is my favorite dish
But if I taste you that'll probably switch
And then we will probably switch
(All around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
Now I'm walking up the street, whistling this

Can't get you off my mind
You're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on
And rock you all night long 'cause I (oh I)
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
I just want to be your man (I just want to be your man)
(All around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
Can't get you off my mind
You're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on
And rock you all night long 'cause I
