Cmon

[Verse 1]
Kickin rocks on the block, tellin all the OG's
I be comin for ya spot, when ya not lookin
Hot cookin mama got it on the kitchen table
I thank God we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable too
Nintendo when them good grades came through
Then the cooked k's came through
Some soft, some stepped on, but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights
Thought I heard niggas comin thought I saw the cop lights but
I was dreamin, then I woke the junkies was still fiendin
And I had coke so, I had hope you may say that its wrong
But I ain't talkin to ya child I'm talkin to this song
I'm just, doin a buck down memory lane
If I crash just pick up my brain
And yes, my niggas the same but they quicker to bang
And if they do then I'm the nigga you blame
So I shoot first anyway
And I would do the honors any day
And tell ya honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the stage like I whip through the yay
Show ya ass how to take 4 and get 8
And it don't take four niggas to get straight
The only hot boy eatin' off this plate: Young
Weezy baby, that's what ya bitch say
Give her ass a location and a template
Show her how to work the interstate
Stop workin with that thinner weight
Getcha brakes fixed
Stop playin, cause all we know is gun-play
Trip while ya fall and my clip gone be empty
When the stomachs get empty anything's tempting
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kid's sake
Hurricane wiped us out like a earthquake
We tryna save face, but we ain't gotta place
To stay, so they made us evacuate
We on our way pussies, relocate
Y'all know us when you see us putcha jewels up
Putcha cars putcha clothes putcha shoes up
It's that serious homie pick the news up
It wasn't good nigga, think about the hood nigga

[Bridge]
The people who ain't, never had shit ain't gon never have shit
Bullshit, cause they still gon try to manage
Niggas doing anything like I don't understand em
But please understand this
Niggas with money lost mansions
Niggas with nothin lost families
Lives lost in traffic
Water up to the attic
There goes the stashes

[Verse 2]
But a nigga got passion
Even though the bounce back seeming like magic
Shit, well call me Sigfried
Watch how I turn one ki to a hundred G's
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze:
Summer please know I live for ya
Throw on the wife beater let back the lid for ya
A few years I'll probably hear from ya
But now I'm here for ya
I know niggas that'll shed a tear for ya
Behind bars tryin to get to ya, and probably never see ya
This that real talk if ya ever heard it homie
Shit hurts so much I might have to hurt ya homie
No commercial no frontin no curve on it
No cut tell life, "so what?"
The droughts here not only white's slowed up
The weed's slowed up, we can't even roll up
Fuck it, put a dent in the money too
But that's the last thing cause hustle is what we do
Hustle with what? how we gettin on?
Where hes sittin at? what hes sittin on
Stand up if you know its true
The end of the world comin and my city the proof, damn
Chyea, and this if after disaster
This ain't rap this is recap
Steppin off the G-4 still strapped
Bust ya head in the air that's a skycap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off, cause it don't go where i reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars
Dead presidents gotta dump the bodies
Birdman as long as we gone eat, then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reachin
And I'ma get there through these bars, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even
When everything pause I can see it
I'ma leader, me, the son of Jacita
Fuck the world not the people
