[Chorus: Rick Ross & (T-Pain)]
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)

[Bridge: Rick Ross & (Wale)]
She got me caught up in the moment (You got some nice pineapples, for real)
She got me caught up in the moment (Wale though, double M, remix)
I only kiss her when she on it
White Ferrari and she got her doin' donuts, hol' up

[Verse 1: Wale]
She like Wa-le my stroke game be on point
Yeah, shawty losing her mind her composure most of her voice
And she say she hate the word moist, but she can't escape from that vibe
You can play fight with that cat, me, I kill that pussy 9 times
I slow it down, let me slow it down
Ever since I hit that, look at it, that shit I got you poking now
Numbers we ain't throwing down, not me, no way, no how
Cause you know them screenshot broads always gonna run they mouth
Okay, I’m far too drunk I’m not driving (what’s up?), you know open bars are on fire
A little green and white in my pocket, so this song is now "Bag of Mara"
Caught up in the wrong timing, yeah, Jacob made my medallion
Just post up, but don’t coach much, but I love the stadium talent

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Bright lights picture, all right colors
I'll let you count my money, don’t think that you own me
You're my bag of my money, you're my bag of honey
I beez in your trap, while you're yelling fuck me
I be on some other shit
Maybach O up in this bitch
Tell you about them other niggas
They be lying about they figures
I’m bout it, bout it I pull the trigger
Y’all be so lame
We killin' the game, I dance in the bank
We so mafioso, you ain't never know though
Never gonna know so, no never no, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: Rick Ross & (T-Pain)]
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
My bitch amazing; show stopper
Work at the titty club; pussy popper
Top drop white on white 645
I burnt her up from 5 o’clock until 6:45
Mr. 60 minutes, Mrs. Chanel, and Fendi
I hit her in the Porsche and burnt her up a new Infiniti
Presidential Rollie, JFK, she Mrs. Kennedy
Rose gold his or hers, diamonds and furs
Want a little suede, one on one bag
Look like a duffel bag of money, she beyond that
And I’m beyond swag, young thug nigga
Drug dealer; MMG affiliated blood nigga
That 50k on that vaca
20 bands on that birkin bag, 12 hunnid on that dinner date
We eat lobsters from Florida, French-ful flowers
Put you on the next level shit, world is ours

[Verse 4: Rockie Fresh]
Got my Sox cap, top back, shorty you could come outside
We can ride, drive an ’88, you know how we drive
You just want somebody that’s consistent and that will provide
I’m just trying to live in your division when your legs divide
I could take you high, you say your man don’t appreciate you
He should learn to be more grateful for somebody that’s been faithful
Instead he trying to play you, you know trying to Stevie J you
I just wanna make you rain like we in the month of April
And we hella young, let’s have some fun and never be on dummy
Got a good sense of humor, but you can’t be acting funny
You will get ate for dinner, but I’m hungry for some money
Every time I go and get it, then I’ll let you count it for me

[Chorus: Rick Ross & (T-Pain)]
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Yea-ea-ea-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Hey-ey-eh-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Ooooh, she bad)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (She bad bad bad, she bad bad bad)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (She bad bad bad, she bad ohh-oh-ooh-wooo-ooh)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Oooh, she ride it for me)

[Verse 5: Trina]
I-I-I’m looking like a money money money badge
That’s why these niggas want me bad
Cause I’m so fucking special, diamonds and precious metals
Giuseppe stilettos, I’m the queen of the ghetto
Trina, I stay winning, I keep these niggas spinning
I’m looking for a boss, let me be your lieutenant
Let me be your masseuse, fine head in the coupe
Ménage in the suite, boy, you know I’m the truth
I stay stunning, looking like a bad of hundreds
You know your momma running, I keep that money coming
He bring that money home, he let me count it for him
Now I’m married to the mob and I’m riding for him

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Uh, my-my bitch mad cause I’d rather get that money
I give her this dick she say that dick better than money
I say, "Can I get some head?" She say, "Let me get my scrunchie"
Serve her like a country, got that dope dick she a junkie
She say "Tunechi, this your pussy", I say "Tell me anything"
Then I suck her nipple ring, eat that pussy; Listerine
She coming I make sure my bitch bad; she'll take yours
And she do tricks on that dick like a skateboard

[Verse 7: Tyga]
Uh, Maybach Riders, gold chain buyers
Gold wings saline your bitch say I’m the fliest
I make five thou gold ya’ll, spent that in about an hour
And my bitch like Bob May, ball hard 'til I get the callous
Shout out I ain’t got no stylist, shout out to you niggas keep trying
Bag of money, bag of money, I eat the money like I eat the pussy
King gold chains, they follow me, presidential car presidential suite
She bad and all, model type, but I like me a big booty
One time for them 9 to 5’s, one time for them stripper dimes
One time for them college girls, one time for those who can’t decide
I love her more I take them all, she doing bad I break her off
I’m T-Raw, don’t need ya’ll, everything I do is so well done

[Chorus: Rick Ross & (T-Pain)]
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)

[Verse 8: French Montana]
I push the drop and let her ride shotty
My bitch bad looking like a bag of mollies
Hit the crib make a porno, my diamonds flash like photos
500 on my auto and I bought it out; fuck car note
Shorty know exactly who the realest is
Murder that (ahh) leave no witnesses
Started from the streets, turned to businesses
Dirty bag of money, stack it to where that ceiling is
Got, shorty, grab it, take it, to that, money
Shorty, dancing, for them, hundreds, got me, paying, on exonics
Bitch I’m balling all green, trying to buy a ball team
No I suit her, roosting, know we going all in

[Verse 9: Black Cobain]
Rolling up some killer, riding through my city
Bumping Bag of Money got a bag of money with me
She conceited, she know that, she was down with a nigga before rap
If I had the strap, she would hold that, she don't even smoke, but she’ll roll that
For me she drinking Henny she don't like it though
She fuck with real niggas cause that’s all she know
Make her pop that pussy hole, make her bring that money back
You niggas couldn't fuck my bitch if you gave her a hundred stacks
She all about a purse, not a bag, though, she work
When I’m in the pussy I surf, when she bless a nigga, like church
I’m on this bag of money remix
I’ll be all up in her Vickie’s but she cannot keep a secret

[Chorus: Rick Ross & (T-Pain)]
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Yea-ea-ea-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Hey-ey-eh-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Ooooh, she bad)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Yea-ea-ea-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Hey-ey-eh-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Ooooh, she bad)

[Bridge: Rick Ross & (T-Pain)]
She got me caught up in the moment (She got me caught up in the moment)
She got me caught up in the moment (She got me caught up in the moment)
I only kiss her when she on it (Ooh, when she on it)
White Ferrari and she got me doin' donuts, hol' up (Oooh-ooh-whoo)
