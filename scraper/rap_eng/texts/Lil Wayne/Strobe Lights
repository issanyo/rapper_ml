(LiL Wayne)

Love is the party, my heart is such a disco ball
She's in line waiting
My guest list too long
I told her i would love her
Love her as forever
Forever's just a word
I put words together
Stepping on the stars, she pause and i know that
One day this show will end, applause
The strobe lights are dancing
We've taken all the chances
She question what we are
And i'll drink to the answer cause
My heart is out of service
My eyes turn black
I don't see love anymore i'm blind to the fact
I got my world in my pocket cause i ain't tryna drop it
The sky is at my neck, so i turn up my collar
My world spin around her
Cause its a whirl without her

(Dirty Money)

When you know, like i know
When the sunlight falls down
There she goes

Strobe lights dance with the stars
And i just can't live without her
And she knows what she knows
And the rain is coming down
My heart is closed. i know she knows

Strobe lights dance with the stars
And i always take my time
And when the lights fade

The lights they turn grey
Bitch you don't love me no more
I'm at the end babe
Going the wrong way
And i don't know where to go

I'm on a new way
Tomorrows too late
Bitch you don't love me more
You got me standing on the verge

(LiL Wayne)

Love create wars
I got wounds and scars
The strobe lights are dancing
Dancing with the stars
But what happened to ours
What happened because
The rain is coming down
Now we trapped in the storm
I step right out of her spotlight
And into the strobe lights
I don't need your light

(i know, i know, i know)
That you're no good
(i know, i know, i know)
That you make me, come back for more
Come back for more
Everytime i try, i can't get away
(i know i know) i know that love is gone tomorrow
(i know i know) and the lights they fade away
(your lies) (your lies)
You keep begging me, begging me
Please don't go

And when the lights fade
The lights they turn grey
Bitch you don't love me no more
I'm at the end babe
Going the wrong way
And i don't know where to go
I'm on a new way
Tomorrows too late
Bitch you don't love me more
You got me standing on the verge
