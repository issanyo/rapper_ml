Hey Barbie, are, are, are, are you into black men?
Hey, hey, hey, Barbie! I could be your black Ken Wow!
'Cause once you go black, you never go back
She wore her hair black, with curls in the back
Then she threw that ass back, back, back
Then I fell to the mat
And after that everything went black!

Baby 1, 2, 3
Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can get the knockout
Get the telephone please
It's an emergency
'Cause he can get the knockout
Get the knockout

Hey Barbie, can I call you Barbara? Ha-ha
Hey Barbie, can I call you tomorrow and today?
'Cause' once you go black, you never go back
And once you go Wayne, everybody else is whack
Then she threw that ass back, back, back
Then I fell to the mat
And after that everything went black!

Baby 1, 2, 3
Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can get the knockout
Get the telephone please
It's an emergency
'Cause he can get the knockout
Get the knockout

Awe fuck it
Give me that damn bucket
Wh-when I throw this pussy
You better not start ducking
Oh yo
Hit him with the blow
Lo-look out in the crowd
And everybody's yelling, "No!"

Grab him by his locks
And give us a good box
Then hit him below the belt
I wanna give him good top
Top, top
Give him good top
Hit him below the belt
I wanna give him good top

1, 2, 3
They're yelling 1, 2, 3
I done hit 'em with that motherfucking crunk two piece
Tell 'em, tell'em to mop out
Too late to cop out
Give 'em more head than toupees that's the knockout

Baby 1, 2, 3
Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can get the knockout
Get the telephone please
It's an emergency
'Cause he can get the knockout
Get the knockout

So just knock me out
Yeah
Just knock me out
So just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out
