[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Girl, I needed you
I was tryna settle down
Baby, I was tryna see this through, yeah
Now you ain't nowhere around
Baby, I can’t believe it's true
I can’t believe it's true
Girl, I believed in you
But now there ain’t nowhere to go

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl, I shouldn’t have left you alone
I shoulda hung up the phone
Leavin’ you them messages
That you never checked
And I should have took back that ring
‘Cause it doesn’t mean anything to you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I hope you know you played yourself
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself
Girl, you know you played yourself
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself (oh no)
Girl, you know you played yourself
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself
Girl, you know you
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself
Girl, you played yourself

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Pew, pew, pew on her ass, tune
Pew, yeah, it's a fuckin' loss, let her ass loose (ayo)
You get two finger lil' mama, two finger lil' mama
Do your thing, now you single, lil' mama, do tina lil'mama, yeah
I'ma do Tunechi so fast, I kiss everythin' but ass, that's not my swag
Ask if I'm okay, I laugh, ask if I'm okay, I dab, then pop a Xans
Smoke one, forget 'bout the ash, I be too lit to get mad
Look, I'm just sayin', you played yourself with all that playin'
You lost this good dick and good man, girl

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
I hope you know you played yourself
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself (yeah)
Girl, you know you played yourself (mula)
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself (oh no)
Girl, you know you played yourself (played yourself)
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself
Girl, you know you
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself
Girl, you played yourself

[Verse 3: Chris Brown &(Lil Wayne)]
You got a lot of nerve (lot of nerve)
Let it be a lesson learnt (uh)
I was in the game, I was puttin' in work (putting it)
I was tryna change to the man you deserve
But you was too caught up in the club (caught up)
Tryna get paid, get a little bud, huh (tryna get pain)
You say it ain't you, I know it is (I know it is)
'Cause love just ain't enough (love ain't enough)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & (Lil Wayne)]
Now I shouldn’t have left you  alone (I should have left you alone)
I shoulda hung up the, hung up the phone (I should have hung up the phone)
All them messages (yeah)
I should have took back that ring,huh (I should have took back that ring)
'Cause it didn’t mean a damn thing to you (didn’t mean a thing to you)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I hope you know you played yourself
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself
Girl, you know you played yourself
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself (oh no)
Girl, you know you played yourself
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself
Girl, you know you
Girl, you played, girl, you played, girl, you played yourself
Girl, you played yourself
