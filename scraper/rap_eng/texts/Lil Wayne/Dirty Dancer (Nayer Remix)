[Verse 1]
Another day
Another night
And she’s acting like she don’t sleep
She’s a five when she drinks
But she’s a ten when she’s on top of me

[Chorus: Enrique and Usher]
She don’t want love
She just want to touch
She’s a greedy girl to never get enough
She don’t want love
She just want to touch
She’s got all the moves
To make you give it up

She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You'll never be her only

She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You'll never be her only

Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
It’s a game (ha!)
That she plays
She can win with her eyes closed

It’s insane
How she tames
She can turn you into an animal

Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]

To make you give it up

Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]

She never satisfied
You better do it right
Before you’re lonely

No she’s never satisfied
You better do it right
Before you’re lonely

Come on

[Lil Wayne]
Hello baby it’s Weezy baby
It’s going down, depreciating
Okay now I don’t dance unless we dancing dirty
Skinny leather pants, I’m on my Eddie Murphy
Shawty shake it fast like she in a hurry
I like the full glass, I like my Mary bloody
She is not doing you and you are not doing nothing
It is not no money like Young Money

[Chorus]
