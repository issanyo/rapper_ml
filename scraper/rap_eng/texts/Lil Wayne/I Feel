I feel like I'mma lose my life for this
I feel like I'mma have to fight for this
I feel motherfuckers they goin' say I'm wrong
I feel you're goin' get buck when you hear my song
I feel you don't even know how I feel
I feel if you hate me you got to get real
I feel like go to Texas and for me some brick
I feel the policeman making me sick
I feel like I could be the president
I feel like burning up their bodies to leave no evidence
I feel you don't even know how I feel
Respect my mind I'm just telling you how I feel

Do you feel like you could lose your life for this
Do you feel like you could fight for this
Do you feel like go to Texas and for me some brick
Do you feel the policeman I'm making you sick
Do you feel like you could be the president
Feel like burning up their bodies to leave no evidence
Do you feel like they don't even know how we feel
I feel that they hate us, we got to get real
Got to get real, real
