I remember then, back in December, it was winter like '89
Shit I must have been 7 goin' on 8
And comin' from da kitchen was an echo from all the bass
And I ain't talkin bout speakers
I saw my daddy in there I would stare, but I wouldn't touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Shit, I just knew too much
So I stop bein' lazy, and I became creative
And I learned how to create it
And all that pot's for me
So come see, or come eat

And I hope that she is having da ride of her life
No red lights in sight
Just a bare room with green lights
Come on now
Who did you, where did you, why did you what did you think she was
That's your ho
But does her water help your garden grow... no

Yeah I know that was crazy
But I think you are more crazier than her
Cuz she is no daisy
Shit she jus pottery
With no seeds
So she can't eat

My heroes had the broads and the cars with big ol' rims
And I could remember slangin', thinkin'
I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little
I lived life numb

It made so much sense for me to run
When da 5-0 come
Cause I ain't dumb

And that shit I hated
Like early 90's late 80's
I was hustlin' as a baby
You can ask Eagle Street, about me
I'm a G

Ever since I was little, ever since I was little I tote my gun
Cause it made no sense where I was from
To walk around wit none
Shit, nigga you would be crazy
Cause niggas is crazy
And I'm a 80's baby
You should be proud of me
Cause in them streets
I'm hot like da 80's
And my temperature's raisin'
I'm at 100 I'm blazin'
Somebody shower me
Please, pretty please

You can call me wizzle, or you can call me Wayne, man either one
But it's Weezy Baby for your slut
I told her Weezy Baby, I told her more than once
But she just say, "Baby", she just calls me "Baby"
She just screams out "Baby!" when she's on top of me
And the sheets be stickin' like pages
And the bed is so stanky
If she say that is my baby, shit it is possibly not for me
M.-O.-E
