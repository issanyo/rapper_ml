I swear to you every time I sees her, I seizure
Keep running through my mind, jog my memories; amnesia
Touch ya, tease ya, nervous? don't freeze up
She let me take control, I run a woman like a Visa
She always run back to me saying he's a
Dog off the leash, he got this other girl Alicia
She tell me she's in hell, I tell her take a breather
I'm nothing like your man, but I can't love you neither
It's wifey over bitches, but money's over her
Cause money's under nothing, my life is such a blur
It's not the way it has to go, it' just what I prefer
And any Young Money nigga I know would concur
Weezy talk to 'em!

Your man ain't worrying about what's going on over here
You could get penalized the way you blowin' below the rear
Now this game like a analog I don't sweat cause it show how fake you are
She stressin', ya she testin' ya, she just tryin' to see what kinda level ya on
You don't make it bounce like a basketball, you ain't even get no ass at all
Now you sittin at the club trying to laugh it off, she done found her mid glam boy
You messin up, you messed up, wasn't easy to clean your Mess up
She found me and I blessed her, I applied to her pressure
She call me a professor, I went gave her her lecture
I bet she says I'm better, than her man was ever

[Hook 1: Drake]
