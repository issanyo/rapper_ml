Looking for a bitch for some sexual healing

We are not the same, Im a muthaf-cking alien

[Birdman]
Back on my saddle with the tool and my hand
Uptown real nigga bitch landed in the sand
Back home nigga did it for the land
For the grand with the money with the tool in my hand
High life, give a fuck about your stripes homey
Killer kill, kill a spend your … daily homie
Turn left get your switch turned of nigga
Turn right and get your shit took off nigga
Fuck cos we higher than we ever been

Overseas nigga pitching on the top floor
High floor situation from the bottom floor
Born in the middle, shining like a diamond
Red diamonds, big diamonds how we roll nigga

High life getting money then we go nigga

Like father like son boy…

[Hook]

[Chorus]
