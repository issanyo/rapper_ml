Hey
(I want a soldier)
The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' Impala's around
(I got a soldier)
With the top down, feeling the sounds

Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs, ridin' harder than guys
With the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them lames be spittin' at you tell 'em don't even try it
To shoot it with Chelle and kick it with Kelly or holla at B
Ya, gotta be G's you way outta your league, please

We like them boys that be in them 'Lac's leanin'
(Leanin')
Open their mouth, their grill gleamin'
(Gleamin')
Candy paint, keep that whip clean and
(Clean and)
They always be talkin' that country slang, we like

They keep that beat that be in the back beatin'
(Beatin')
Eyes be so low from there kief
(Kief and)
I love how he keep my body screamin'
(Screamin')
A rude boy that's good to me, with street credibility

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough and he better be street

We like them boys up top from the B.K
(b.k.)
Know how to flip that money three ways
(Three ways)
Always ridin' big on the freeway
(Freeway)
With that East Coast slang that us country girls be like

Low cut caesars with the deep waves
(Deep waves)
So quick to snatch up your Beyonce
(Beyonce)
Always comin' down poppin' our way
(Our way)
Tellin' us that country girls the kinda girl they like

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough and he better be street

I know some soldiers in here

Hey, see, Cash Money is a army
I'm walkin' with purple hearts on me
You talkin' to the sergeant
Body marked up like the subway in Harlem

Call him, Weezy F. Baby, please say the Baby
If you don't see me on the block I ain't tryin' to hide
I blend in with the hood, I'm camouflage
Bandanna tied, so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name she salute

I like them boys over there, they lookin' strong tonight
(Strong tonight)
Just might give one the phone tonight
(Phone tonight)
Homey in the Dickies in my zone tonight
(Zone tonight)
He don't know it might be on tonight
(On tonight)

Ooh, he lookin' good and he talkin' right
(Talkin' right)
He the type that might change my life
(Change my life)
Every time he look at me, my girls be like
(Girls be like)
That one may be the one tonight

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he looking at me
