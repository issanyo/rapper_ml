[Intro]
Oh yeah,oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeeeeeeeah oh yeah, ooooooh

[Verse 1 Lloyd]
I'm lost when you're not in my clutch
That's the cost for loving you so much
The love feels better than an indo
Like the love made to the right tempo
You was there when them people came knocking
When I wasn't on top you was rocking
In the middle of lip locking
So if somebody try you, get popping
Baby you're a special kinda lady
And I will keep you safe in my arms, you'll feel no harm

[Chorus]
While I'm riding round, I'm riding round, I'm riding round
In the city, in my foreign with the top off
If you try me it's gon pop off
You know I'm holding it while I'm holding you
And they can say, and they can say, and they can say what they want, but they know what it is though
You the one I do the deed for
That's why I'm holding it while I'm holding you

[Verse 2 Lil Wayne ]
Uh baby girl shotgun
Holding down the shotgun
Ain't worried bout the outcome
Real bitch forever
I'm the only one she down for
Most of these hoes blood hounds
She don't even hound blood
Baby girl my baby doll
Take the charge take the fall
Cuz weezy baby drippin baby
Aww watch this eight dissolve
That Bonnie that Clyde
That Velma and lil Weezy
She say I'm like that pistol
You gonna need me feed me squeeze me
Yeahhhh
Mula

[Verse 3 Lloyd]
I wanna go deeper
Cuz I'm a ring
Turn a G into a love machine
All I need is your loving baby (on me)
You hold my heat
You roll my weed
You so my speed
You're all I need
Baby I would bleed just to see you smile
(cause girl you are my heart)
Ooh baby
You a special kind of lady
And I will keep you safe in my arms
You will feel no harm

[Chorus]
While I'm riding round, I'm riding round, I'm riding round
In the city, in my foreign with the top off
If you try me it's gon pop off
You know I'm holding it while I'm holding you
And they can say, and they can say, and they can say what they want, but they know what it is though
You the one I do the deed for
That's why I'm holding it while I'm holding you

[Outro]
Carrying 10 rounds in the clip
And I'll set this motherfucker off, nigga don't trip (Holding you)
Yeah I keep a full pound on my hip
You better cool it down round my bitch
Carrying 10 rounds in the clip (I wanna go deeper)
And I'll set this motherfucker off, nigga don't trip
In my foreign with the top off
If you try me it's gon pop off


[Chorus]
While I'm riding round, I'm riding round, I'm riding round
In the city, in my foreign with the top off
If you try me it's gon pop off
You know I'm holding it while I'm holding you
And they can say, and they can say, and they can say what they want, but they know what it is though
You the one I do the deed for
That's why I'm holding it while I'm holding you
