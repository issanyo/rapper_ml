Im spitting flames like may
Erybody come on up look this way
Trap house rap nigga you know im back
Hit the mic, hit the shit
But boy you think that was a hit?
So all those bitches wanna fuck with me
Im spitting lava like its flame on me

Box head looking like drake head ass
But drakes cool cause he make sings too for a pass
I be running running gotta take me to back
I spit all flames
A mic that i can get with too much flames
A fired cooler mic i can turn into fame

I spit all flames
I spit i spit
I spit all flames
Oh I
I spit all flames ooh
Aye aye

All my niggas brown so they so tanned
I got a wolf i like to tammed
Wait that means forever ever ever for my life
A curly headed cutie she turn into Kyles wife
Wait that means oh man oh lord bitch thats crazy
I spit flames all day and yo spit ice like lazy
