[Verse 1]
High in the video, ---- with me, hella raw
Raw got a little riddle, riddle, work for a star
Started from the bottom, like Christina, got a million
Man I'm a good guy, turned to a vill-i-an
Bully in the pack turned to a rat
Girls on my jack, I hit a girl with a car bomb
Bombs in L.A., bombs in the Bay
Boy you ain't safe, I run with dudes like O-Dog
All we do is ball, all we do is ball, now I'm passed out
Lean in the drop, ice in the watch
That's Ben & Jerry dollars, watch a ---- make a stack house
Gingerbread man run while you can
All you dudes lame, tooly on me, got killers on speed dial
Infrared blam if a ---- shout
Don't get packed out, prolly hit a paparazzi when I back out

[Hook]
Can you see now? Are you senile?
Can you see now? You could see now?
Can you see now? Can you see now?
Can you see now? When you see a ---, don't be actin' senile

[Verse 2]
Sky dweller check, helicopter pad
Droppin' off a body bag
Money talk, guess I got the gift of gab
Don't interject, don't intercept
You ain't on a jet, you ain't meet a, with this kinda money yet
Yeah, I got an Audemar, I ain't set the time once
And I know they say they shine, I ain't seen 'em shine once
All these rappers is my sons, and I'm always nine months
Man if this was baseball, I ain't let 'em slide once
Do you see now? You playin' D now?
Oh, you wanna beat me, how?
Oh, you the number one draft in the league now?
Ride down ya block, doors twelve o'clock
Lambo, the drop, bike mans, ain't stoppin' for a cop
I got this beat locked tighter than a bear hug
When them dudes rap, girls need an ear plug

[Hook]
Can you see now? Are you senile?
Can you see now? You could see now?
Can you see now? Can you see now?
Can you see now? When you see a nigga, don't be actin' senile

[Bridge]
Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street
Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street
Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street
Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street

[Hook]
Can you see now? Are you senile?
Can you see now? You could see now?
Can you see now? Can you see now?
Can you see now? When you see a nigga, don't be actin' senile
Can you see now? Are you senile?
Can you see now? You could see now?
Can you see now? Can you see now?
Can you see now? When you see a nigga, don't be actin' senile
