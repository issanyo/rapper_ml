[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

Yea, Ice Cream hoodie, Bathing Ape tennis shoes
No time for pictures, no time for interviews
I'm gon' get the money, snowstorm or sunny
Try me and I'm coming out my coat arm with somethin'
Note on the table, pay me or they go
You can't get the cash then pay me in yayo
Save me the drama don't go run and snitch
If that's your mama then I'll murk you right in front of that bitch
Im a Young Money, Cash Money, Universal soldier
Watch out Ms. Sylvia, I'm kinda feelin' ya, ha
I'm a headache, but they love the pain
I ask a bitch her name and tell her go board the plane
I'm so sure I know more, I'm so more than Wayne
I know whores that know whores that's always with some more whores
You owe whores, I show whores, I grow whores
I know what's at the store cause I go more, I go forth and so forth
Mami say she so bored with old boy, uh oh
I leave that pussy so sore, that's right no doze
Bitch get lost in the current how the dough flows
Niggas call Maybachs lo-lo's
Nigga got the Glock in a choke hold, I won't fold
To the cops, to the po-po's, ya'll hoes
Shout to my stompin' ground, Hollygrove
Fuck with them New Orleans niggas, funeral
Uptown, Uptown's where I rose
Yea, welcome to the real outdoors and of course
That chopper that I tote will split 'em like a divorce
Then the spiritual force, take 'em way up North
They say the end is comin', I'mma stay up for it
I'mma chase that money, you can wait up for it
I'm a kick to the snare, I'm a boom to the bass
What more can I say? I can't feel my face

[Verse 2:Juelz]
Deal up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
I'm a dealer, dealer, I bring it back all the time
That coke, that hard, that crack, oh God
You get caught, you can't give back no charge
Nigga mouth slow-leakin', air him out, no charge
That's free, no prod, that's "G code" ya'll
So, no more slow-leakin, now he just got a flat
Flatline laid on his back flat, halftime
In the crib playin EA sports
They in the streets till the D.A. see they corpse
Plus the chickies know I stay fresh till my tippy toes
Hit the sneaker store and say two words "gimme those" (gimme)
Gimme those (those) Gimme those (those)
Matter fact gimme those whole three rows
I hit the Saks like gimme that (that) gimme that (that)
Gimme that, matter fact gimme that rack
Cash laid, tab paid, I'm out
I'm off to the valet, where's my car? thank you
Who's better than me? You? Never! I abuse cheddar
Playboy, Hugh Hefner
The two next up my dick yes uhh
I buy a car just because I like the smell of new leather
I'm young, I'm fly, I'm black, I'm rich
I let my nuts sag, I drag my dick (ya dig?)
The whores know I let my balls sag also
Off they drawers go, I'm all in they torso (Oh)
She can't take the dick, I tell her put a sock in it, bitch take the dick
Stroke, stroke see if she can take the dick
Now see if she can take the brick, you on the team now
Meanwhile, I'm in the kitchen doin' my daily routine
Scale a few things, cook a few O's, let my bitch bag 'em
Give it to my workers, let the strip have 'em
Fiends go berserk for the work I'm chefin'
Fiends go to work after the work you sell them
They know they gotta buy more, they head hurt they eyes sore
You're selling that cheap rock, sheet rock, dry wall
They don't want that, they come back for more
But they come back to me, they don't come back to y'all
I be chef, the chef you neva have to re-chef
When I chef, comprende? rewind, reset, replay, action
I be chef, the chef you never have to re-chef
When I chef, comprende? (Aye)

[Outro: Juelz Santana]
Yea, Santana, Dipset
Weezy F.Baby, Cash Money
I can't feel my face, nope I can't feel my face Aye!
