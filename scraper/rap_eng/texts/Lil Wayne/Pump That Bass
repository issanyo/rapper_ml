Court is now in order baby girl throw the book at me

Underneath the blanket it's gonna be a conspiracy
Offer me to manage, not takin off ya panties
But I do life if I touch his wife
But she wanna get right, so we do it all night till the woman is like
On my mic, that's a 1-2 check, check for a sound byte, right

Talkin' to the owner, ye my price blown up
All in the strip club, never get a boner
Only get hard for D'oh! I'm Homer
And you're a simp son, and I'm a pimp son
And she ain't comin' to the crib till her friend come

Hand made with the brand on the seam of the pants
And the steam in the seam of the pants also
And the steam, letter B on so don't go no where
Got plenty, more here and there
The shoes I wear you don't own a pair
Get it clear like a mirror, that's why ya girlfriend stare
Just been elected the president here
Cheers, cheers, tangerine tequila, no beers
Ye, I like this here
Wit Ciara on the track it's music to my ears
That's when I go to the store and I ask for a Philly
If they don't have a Philly, I ask for a Swisha
If they don't have a swisha, I ask for..
That's when I ask for, that's when I ask for a Dutchey!
I ask for a Dutchey, they gotta have a Dutchey
I don't smoke backwoods I just smoke Dutcheys
And mama over there say she gon' fuck me
But, but naw she can't touch me
Cuz my girl is lookin' way good
