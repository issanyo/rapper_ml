Rap:
When We Hooked Up
We Sat Down Made An Agreement
We Vowed That We Would
Always Be
Together Through Whatever
We Say That No One Would Eva
Come
Between Us
Said We Would Never Ever Leave Us
That Was A While Ago
But
Its Like Lately
It Feels Like
I Mean I Feel Like
All We Do Is Fight

And Every Single Night
We Can't Get It Tight
We Can't Get It Right
I
Just Wanta Go Back
Take It Way Back
All The Way Back
Start Again Do It
Over
Can We Straighten It Out
Can We Work It Out
Cause I Dont Want Be
Without
(You You You And I Just Can't Hit Rock Bottom
Over You)
You Make Me Feel Like
A Natural Man
And I Stand Under The Clouds
Tryna Catch You If I Can
And If That Goes As Planned
Then Safely You Should Land
We Will Hold Hands And Dance
To The Beat Drums Of Are Heart
We Should Never Be Apart
I Pray The Music Never Finish
From The Start On Ya Mark
Get Ready Set Pume
As I Race To The FinishLine
Better Yet The Top
Cause I Dont Wanta Hit Rock Bottom
Bottom Line
Please

Pleasure P
Chorus:
Girl Im Beggin An Pleadin
Gotta Nigga Feelin You Darlin
Them Liquor Bottles Got Problems
I Done Hit Rock Bottom Over You
And Im Missin Them Kisses
The Way Your Body Just Glistens
When Your In The Shower
Just Listen
I Done Hit Rock Bottom Over You Lets Go You Again You
And I Can't Just Hit Rock Bottom Over You Again You Again You Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
