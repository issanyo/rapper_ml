[Verse 1: Jae Millz]
Just like Treach, and Vinnie by nature I'm naughty baby
Turn down for what? It's time for the afterparty baby
It's a quarter past three, so what we doing baby?
Shake ya homegirls, it's time to lose em baby
Porsche Carerra, top down, we cruising baby
Got that Donell  Jones playin', yeah we groovy baby
Me and yo man, don't compare so don't confuse me baby
He the trailer, and I'm the actual movie baby
And I can't even front, I ain't gon' lie
Don't judge me girl, but I'm gon 'try
And after all of this champagne, you probably taste like warm pie
You probably go to sleep stressed out
You probably really get stretched out
And I ain't talkin bout ya next [?]
From the shower as soon as you step out
Never been a minuteman, nor a one rounder
Every stroke I'm aimin' deep, and tryna make ya scream louder
Beat it up, knock that pussy out the park, you know I'm bout that
I ain't tryna play no games,  I'm tryna fuck the soul out you, what's up

[Hook: Donell Jones] x2
It's a quarter past three
Girl, what's it gonna be
Shorty got her eyes on me
We've been talking since two
Girl, what you gonna do
Tell 'em that you're riding with me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, What you know about that breakfast in bed?
Nothing, cause we always eating each other instead
Oh Lord, we can't even see each other and chill
No Lord, we met each other in LIV
I wanted to fuck her in LIV, I wanted to fuck her and live
I wanted to love what she feel until she say fuck it, it's his
I want to start up from her heels and make my way up to her ears
Unbutton brassier
She look at this fuck from the rear
I put her hands up on the mirror
They smudge and they smear
When we makin' love it's sincere
When we makin love it's a [???]
When we makin love it's surreal
Oh yeah, oh yeah
She scream oh yeah, oh yeah
The freaky type for real
She treat me like four wheels
She keep it tight and sealed
She get this pipe, this drill
She feed me lies who knows
Lord I just love the meal
And I just checked my watch, she said "don't check yo watch"
But it's so late, my girl ain't dumb, she gon' connect the dots
Fuck it, we flee the scene, and I [?]
I get deep between, and then she sleep and dream
Gone

[Hook: Donell Jones] x2
It's a quarter past three
Girl, what's it gonna be
Shorty got her eyes on me
We've been talking since two
Girl, what you gonna do
Tell 'em that you're riding with me

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
Ass so fat, there's no way around that
You gotta slim waist, you gotta round back
I gotta few pills, I gotta loud pack
Im tryna hit it hard, and watch it bounce back
Against the wall, or where the couch at
Or in the bedroom, or where the shower at
Or even sky high on the balcony I'm all about that, don't doubt that
Ain't too many things that we could do at this hour
That's why I'm tryna get you to take something off like a voucher
Beat it up, knock that pussy out, shout out to Ronda Rousey
I ain't tryna play no games,  I'm tryna fuck the soul out you, what's up

[Hook: Donell Jones] x2
It's a quarter past three
Girl, what's it gonna be
Shorty got her eyes on me
We've been talking since two
Girl, what'cha gonna do
Tell 'em that you're riding with me
