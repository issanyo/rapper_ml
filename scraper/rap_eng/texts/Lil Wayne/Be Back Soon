Sittin in the ferrari, thinkin bout money
I swear i will go head up with all of yall, bumpercar
Bullshit fly by me, im duckin all the bad vibes
Shoot you nine times just in case you got cat lives
Uh, my punch lines give you black eyes
Like, like, gon' kill ya self, seven pounds
I been to hell and back, and made it back fine
Black diamonds killin em, black on black crime
Now can i live and if i can, can i live it up?
Imma squeeze life, just enough to fill tha cup
Well shut the fuck up and steam the purp
Drink it all, im dead
So i throw some ice in it, and belch when i finish, Uh
Excuse me
I heard you got that good, ready for the takeoff
Fire up that wood, at the take, blastoff
To another world, let em see that white moon
Flyin in the sky, tell em we'll be back soon
Uh, its the martian and i come for all
I swear i will go head up with all of yall, bumpercar
Nigga im a slummerdog, millionaire, been there
Smoke some kush and snap my fingers
In case you got cat lives, Uh
So much for bein settled down, suicide flow
Gon' kill ya self, seven pounds
Blunt thick as Bobby Christina, high as Serena's skirt
Only smokin that real grass, no arena turf
Now can i live? and if i can, i rep that dirty south
And you haven't seen cleaner dirt, you haven't seen the worse
So shut the fuck up and steam the purp, tell them haters ?
Yea ive lost my mind, help me find it, i will lead the search, Uhh
I heard you got that good, ready for the takeoff
Fire up that wood, at the take, blastoff
To another world, let em see that white moon
Flyin in the sky, tell em we'll be back soon
