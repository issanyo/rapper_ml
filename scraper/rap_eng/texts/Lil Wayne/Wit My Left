[Chorus: Fendi P]
I whip this shit with my left (with my left)
I whip this shit with my left (my left)
I whip this shit with my left (with my left)

[Verse 1: Fendi P]
Foul on the play, where the ref? (ref) I'm the one, go in, attack (attack)
On me these fuck niggas was there, no loyalty, no respect
Niggas like us is extinct, it's only a few of us left (a few)
I hold that bitch to the side (to the side), I whip that shit with my left (whip it)
I seen some murders in person (person), shit wasn't business, it was personal (personal)
Hi-Tech, yellow Tuss and some purple (Act'), I had to roll me a personal (personal)
I lost a pack, had to suffer (had to suffer), shit had me sick to my stomach
You judge a nigga, how he overcome? I'm seclusive and nigga a hundred
AK hold a hundred, I had to trap off [?]
I grind from Monday to Monday, baby, you heard me
Even on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I got a lick on some birdies
Bitch you too thirsty, I'm drippin' Fiji (Fiji)
Get what I want out the bitch, she a genie (a genie)
A xan and a soda, call it a martini
Push start the car make the top eeny-weeny (eeny-weeny)
What's that, you dreamin'? This shit is really is happenin'
I gotta own, automatic, I know some hoes they from Dallas
I call them, bands make them [?]
Hold so much green, fuck a salad, I might just cop me some Bally's
I whip it up with a fork, I really shine in the dark
I bring that Rollie to life, I whip that shit with my left make it right

[Chorus: Fendi P]
I whip this shit with my left (with my left)
I whip this shit with my left (my left)
I whip this shit with my left (with my left)
I whip this shit with my left (my left)
I whip this shit with my left (with my left)
I whip this shit with my left (my left)
I whip this shit with my left (with my left)
I whip this shit with my left (my left)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I whip this shit with my left, I had to sip then I slept
I woke up ready to chef, my hoe up ready to F
We pull up on y'all when y'all deep
We be mellow, mysterious, and mystique
Then one of us ask for directions
Like, "Excuse me, do you know where the- "brrrrrr""
We light it up, nigga, we fuckin' the Cypher up, nigga
We get out and rifle but nigga
The shit that we takin' is psychin' up niggas
To kill niggas like it's nun' nigga
Look left and right and duck nigga
I chef the white right up, nigga, I whip the shit with my left
And give it to my right-hand man 'cause he know that it's life or death
We got the snow in the summer, I got the dope on my women
I got the stick on myself 'cause I know that it's life or death
Whip the whip cream like a stealth, whip the white til I see wealth
Head first like Michael Phelps, red syrup, that's not gon' help
'Cause I need that yurple, only the money is verbal
We got more tan than surfers, watch my left hand do circles
The cocaine expand the surface, I just bought the bando curtains
I seen more sand than turbans, seen more white girl than bourbon
Served on Bourbon, give us the word, we hurt 'em
Give us a check that's murder, fuck the verdict
Trap in your area, chain like aquarium
Right hand or left whip up, we ambidextrous

[Chorus: Fendi P]
I work this shit with my left (with my left)
I work this shit with my left (my left)
I work this shit with my left (with my left)
I work this shit with my left (my left)
I work this shit with my left (with my left)
I work this shit with my left (my left)
I work this shit with my left (with my left)
I work this shit with my left (my left)
