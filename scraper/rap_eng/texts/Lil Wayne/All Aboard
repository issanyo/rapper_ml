[Intro]
Hey
Escucha las palabras... de Romeo
You need this in your life
Ven aqui

[Verse 1: Romeo]
I am gonna give you instructions
You just got to follow my lead
Your body's making sounds like percussion
I'm orchestrating your fantasies

[Pre-Chorus]
And when you wake up
Feeling like a dream
You are not going to believe
And everything you need
Girl, you going to receive it tonight
And I know your condition
I'ma let me make you feel alive
Relax and feel the ride

[Chorus]
So act like it's the last time
The last chance for you to go there
There's one ticket left, and girl it's for you baby
The last grind, and girl you won't find this feeling no where
You better hurry because the train is leaving
All aboard

(Come on)
(Montate, mami)

[Verse 2: Romeo]
I use words as persuasion
I don't got a reason to speak
It's always a special occasion
And it's on your layer with me

[Pre-Chorus & Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
She want to ride that Wayne train
So I am a bag her like baggage claim
We smoked that Mary not plain Jane
And everything is just fine
I keep a picture of her smiling in the back of my mind
I grab the back of her head she throw it back like rewind
I put her face in the pillow, taste it a little
Shawty said she feel like she's sitting on a missile
I said 5-4-3-2, the one can only be you
Shawty said, oh Lord, I'm coming, I said me too
My love has no equal, get on top
And if you ride this train, get off at your stop

[Pre-Chorus & Chorus]
