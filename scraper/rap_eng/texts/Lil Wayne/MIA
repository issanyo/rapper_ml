I'ma South Beach soulja, hold ya horses

Puerto Rican face, but her booty is Jamaican
Breasts Brazilian, she, talk familiar
Her look will hurtcha, her walk will kill ya
Now I'm with Khaled, he got me a mansion
How come every girl up in here look like an actress?
Baby girl, if i find my camera, I'll point that thing directly at ya
My wrist is a bitch and my neck, a bastard
I rap but I don't get paid like rapper's
I'm fresh, I'm cool, dapper
All white tennis shoes, look like napkins
I'm strapped, yup I keep that clappa
I point that thing directly at ya

Me so New Orleans, can't take that from me
But gangsta's don't die, they jus move to Miami
Yea, hop on the bike and peel
Come down Collins on one back wheel
Baby, I'm the hottest, and that's for real
Come to the condo, in ass and heels
Have a drink, have some pills
And make her think I'm Shaq O'Neal
If she won't tell, then I won't squeal
It's the sunshine state, and I'm glad I'm here
