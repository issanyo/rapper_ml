[Intro]
Cut The Music Up
Let's Remix It...

[Hook-Lil Wayne & L.Leflore]
You had a lot of niggas trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
(How to love, how to love)
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
(How to love, how to love)
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love...

*Clear Throat*

[Verse 1-L.Leflore]
Uh
You was such a sweet and innocent little girl
Who had a lot of big dreams in this little world
Sadly, those dreams wasn't pursue
Cause you met a nigga who "Promise" to take care of you
Come to find out, that shit wasn't true
All that nigga wanted to do was to take advantage of you
He manipulated your mind so fast in a hurry
You turn down every good nigga, for that one nigga who did you dirty
That nigga treated you like an NBA Game, where he threw the ball in the air and walked off like curry
Cause that nigga swear he's the "best"
Telling you "I love you" just to get between yo legs
Got yo dumbass feelin' all depress
That nigga doing nothin' but fuckin' with yo head
Like he did with the rest
But you still gave him the test, thinkin' he deserve another chance
The only time that nigga ever wanted you, is when you takin' off your pants
It's sad cause you believe that's how you gonna find love
But baby just listen cause I'm here to teach you, how to love...

[Hook-Lil Wayne & L.Leflore]
You had a lot of niggas trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
(How to love, how to love)
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
(How to love, how to love)
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love...

*Clear Throat*

[Verse 2-L.Leflore]
Okay
You had a lot of goals that transform to visions
Ever since you saw the real world, that shit fucked up all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, cause that shit wasn't in your intentions
You hear where I'm coming from but you don't bother to listen
You acting all heartless but deep down I know you're hurt, I can see it, I'm always payin' attention
But you don't wanna admit what's on your mind
You always lying to me with that bullshit ass line: "I'm fine"
Your heart is something I gotta find
And take care of
All that stress, depress, and crying shit, I gotta get rid of
Being heartless isn't gonna make you find love
So take my hand my love cause I'm here to show you how to love...

[Hook-Lil Wayne & L.Leflore]
You had a lot of niggas trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
(How to love, how to love)
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
(How to love, how to love)
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love...

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

[Hook-Lil Wayne & L.Leflore]
You see you had a lot of niggas trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of niggas trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck

How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love...
