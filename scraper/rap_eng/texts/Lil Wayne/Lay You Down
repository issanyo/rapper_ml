Get paid the salary, look at me, but don't stand 'cause they're, right here
View my mirrors hell yeah

Two tear drops under that eye on the sparrow (uhhh)
I'm from a small place they call Uptown where we (lay you) where we (lay you (ha ha ha!) down)

Like concrete in the driveway, shoot sideways like O Dog on Menace
Leave yo' brains in yo' tennis, I'm the renaissance man
So put me in the book and I got my pistol on the hook singing... ha ha ha!
