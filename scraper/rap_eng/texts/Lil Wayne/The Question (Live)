[Intro: Mac Miller]
This next song one of my favorite to perform its called The Question, alright

Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
I'm askin' what am I supposed to do?
I've done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures
But I'm a hostage in my own world
And my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'm a cope
I think they underestimate the grind
I do, bring this dough, and I'm only 20 years old
I wonder why I sip this devil juice
Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected

[Hook: Mac Miller]
What am I doing here?
I wanna know I wanna know
What am I doing here
Said, What am I doing here
Said, What am I doing here

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever
I don't want to come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, who goin' to touch me now
And do we ever get to know the truth?
Cause everybody say they have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed
And you can never do too much if you don't ever do enough
Wonder why it's me instead of you
I'll be there to rescue you, problems you got several
Thank God that none of that medical

What I need yall to do put two hands in the air
We gon' go slow side to side

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Said, what am I doing here?
What am I doing here
Woah, what am I doing here
Said, what am I doing here

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro: Mac Miller & Mac Miller and Tay Walker]
Now one time look before we do this song right here
Before we do this song
Alirght, you gotta say: God damn!
God Damn! (repeat a lot of times)
