[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I I I I be on that on that all night Man I be on that all day
Straight up boy if you want me I'll be ridin with that k k k k k k k k

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Time and time again I gotta grab my phone and call Lil Wayne
Let me use your throw away cause niggas out here playin, mang
They just don't get it till I pop the trunk and come back with it
Barrel on the burner big enough to spit a hundred midgets
I'm from the crescent city, moving nothing less than fifty
That's more shells than you'll find in the seat
And you don't need to know your alphabets to recognize a G
I'm in the lambo making doughnuts like I work for Krispy Kreme
Excuse my flossin', dawg I'm still known to tote a snub
Niggas thought I lost all my blickas in that Katrina flood
I still got big you MAC-11 from '97
Sometimes you gotta show niggas better than you can tell them

[Hook: Mack Maine, Lil Wayne, & Curren$y]
I be on that gangster shit straight up on that gangster shit
I be on that straight up on that I be on that gangster shit
I be on that straight up on that I be on that gangster shit
I, I, I, I be on it on it all night man I be on it all day
Straight up boy if you want me I be riding with that K
Who want it? K. Who want it? K. Who want it? K uhh

I'm on that gangsta shit, I'm on that gangsta shit

[Hook 2: Mack Maine]
Chevys ridin' swerving out
Mufflers stuffed with dro and blow
Mack Maine, Young Money, motto's still, "Fuck a ho"
Burners on the front seat in case a hater come that close
Bodies drop when the shotty pop they'll probably make your body rock

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Body rock, yep, nigga, lean with it rock with it
Thang that make you lean, I be seen round the clock with it
See I don't stop with it, hustle for that new money
Smelling like them new hundreds diarrhea loop runnin'
See I just recruit something that help me move it every day
More workers than Mary Kay, vibin to that Mary J
I'm off the chain like free slaves, bitch, I'm bout my chips
I'm Mack Maine, bitch, I'm on that gangster shit

[Hook: Mack Maine, Lil Wayne, & Curren$y]
I be on that gangster shit straight up on that gangster shit

Straight up boy if you want me I be riding with that K
Who want it? K. Who want it? K. Who want it? K uhh
K. Who want it? K. Who want it? K. Who want it? K uhh
I'm on that gangsta shit, I'm on that gangsta shit
I'm on that gangsta shit, I'm on that gangsta shit

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Time and time again I gotta turn around and tell Fee Dawg
Grab this AK off my back or theres gonna be blood all on them dawg
Clip longer than a bitch if a nigga trip pop it on in give a nigga that shit
Pull it right over and park that whip, everybody better run when the trunk gone lift
Shit the only thing I'm runnin from myself with a gun when the po po come
The nigga that talk ain't talking bout nothing, I'm a rude boy, I murder for fun
I'm hot bitch word to the sun, I'm the Birdman's son, I'm the chosen one
I'm the god just looking for a nun, I'm the president my job here is done

[Hook 2: Mack Maine]
Chevys ridin' swerving off mufflers stuffed with dro and blow
Mack Maine, Young Money, motto's still, "Fuck a ho"
Burners on the front seat in case a hater come that close
Bodies drop when the shotty pop they'll probably make your body rock

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Lean with it lean with it lean with it and snap your fingers nigga
Make ya lean with it make ya lean with it make 'em lean with it now bring the hook in and tell 'em dawg

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Curren$y]
I, I, I, I be on it on it all night man I be on it all day
