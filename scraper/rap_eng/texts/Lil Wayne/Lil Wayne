[Hook]
Getting money is my mother fuckin’ trait
We she see me she gonna follow like some bait
Fuck the first night, we don’t do no dates
She gon’ suck me till I mother fuckin’ faint
You know I’m higher than a plane
My soul is dying I can feel it in my veins
I need some supplements to numb out all the pain
I’m not a human being like I’m Lil Wayne, aye
All the way we go
I’m just ready to glow
I’m just ready to blow
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
I’ma pull up in that mother fuckin’ phantom, aye
She can not get on my luck cause she a scamma’, aye
Oh she’s strippin’ for that money, she a dancer, aye
She the type to call but I just wouldn’t answer, aye
I’ma pull up in that mother fuckin’ phantom, aye
She can not get on my luck cause she a scamma’, aye
Oh she’s strippin’ for that money, she a dancer, aye
She the type to call but I just wouldn’t answer, aye
No, I wouldn’t answer
No, I wouldn’t answer
I wouldn’t answer

[Hook]
Getting money is my mother fuckin’ trait
We she see me she gonna follow like some bait
Fuck the first night, we don’t do no dates
She gon’ suck me till I mother fuckin’ faint
You know I’m higher than a plane
My soul is dying I can feel it in my veins
I need some supplements to numb out all the pain
I’m not a human being like I’m Lil Wayne, aye
