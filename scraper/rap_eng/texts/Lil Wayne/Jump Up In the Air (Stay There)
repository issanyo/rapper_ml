I know you want to, reach to the higher level
Much further from the devil, until you feel the weather

Much further from the devil, until you feel the weather

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Hi - G-H-two-oh, dial never
My level far from the devil, have some manners
Say hello, to angels and watch out for Uranus
I go nuts like a Danish then vay-nish into thin air
And stay in there
This is Deep Carter, betta bring ya swimwear, heh
But I'm shallow and when ya this high
Everybody else balow - oops, I meant below!
Mijo, zero degree yo, frio
Get into your soul like Neo, whee-oh
Oh, I meant oh-whee - or is it ooh-whee?
Truly, I don't give a fuck
I am on the ceiling stuck, like a fan full of dust
Like a hand full of bucks I'm, spendin like crazy
I'm in Wayne's World where the women like ladies
And you don't need a telescope to see Weezy F. Baby, hah!

Like a fan full of dust, like a hand full of bucks
We spending like, crazy
Come Fly with us (hey)
