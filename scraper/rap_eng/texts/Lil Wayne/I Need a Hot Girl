[Verse 1: Mannie Fresh]
You need a hot one I got one, I take and bend
Shake it down, break it down, with me and a friend
Biggity bounce, slide, ride, work that cat to the right
Push it down, push it up, boom you dynamite
Lick it up like ice cream, nigga you know
To make me bow bow bow bow (Rocky Balboa)
See I loving it when you thugging, baby just don't stop
You could wobledee wobledee (drop drop it like it's hot)
Beat it up and eat it up, love that's your dick
And if you ain't from the ghetto, then ride out bitch
Arms, legs, backs, and breast
You better read her fucking tats, nigga
"Mannie Fresh"
Suck it up and yuck it up, baby work on that pole
Got them niggas in a circle hollering here we go-o
Back that azz up yeah all the way to the zipper
I really love you hot girl but I got to flip her

And she got the matchin Roley, ho, floss your shit
And she got the matching mink for the winter bitch
See a real hot girl can't be faded bitch
Roll the dice, hit the sev', no crap no bitch

Yokahama 20-inch dubs on that bitch
See my Cash Money hot girl floss her shit
Ridin Uptown bumping Hot Boys ya bitch
And that blue faced Rolex I bought that bitch

[Verse 3: B.G]
Where my bitch at? Look, a hot girl is a silent ho
If a bitch get outta line she a violent ho
Ain't no pest, far from being a whining ho
Fuck up she confess, she ain't no lying ho
That's what I need, a hot girl is a jazzy bitch
I'd take her any day for a classy bitch
On the down low for her nigga she a nasty bitch
I tell her touch it, she gonna reach down and grab the dick
I bust a nut, it's soft, she get it back hard
The police kick in the door she take the charge
If a nigga go to jail she run for a nigga
Money orders, business, and go run for a nigga
She be a nigga balling, would get bout it for her nigga
Lemme come thorugh, hit the stash, and walk up by the nigga
I can't see no other bitch for the B.G
But a hot girl fo' sho' call her a H.G., a hot girl

[Hook]
(What you need boy?)

(What you want boy?)

[Verse 4: Turk & Lil' Wayne]
[Turk]
I like 'em hot, the ones that don't tell me to stop
Eat dick swallow the cum, and they know how to pop
I need a project bitch, a hoodrat bitch
One that don't give a fuck and say she took that dick

[Lil' Wayne]
She a doggy with it, she gonna wobbledee
Then she know I'm d want it with it
Open her legs and squeeze a nigga
Like she want me in it
Now turn around and back it up
Then throw it at a nigga
Until I say, "Ohh that's enough"

[Turk]
Give me a gangsta ho, one that don't give a fuck
And that'll shank a ho
The one that'll slang still, and keep it on the low
One that'll do time for me, and say fuck the po'
To all you know

[Lil' Wayne]
A lil' shorty in the twat have it hurting and thumping
They be like, "They say he small girl but he workin with something"
I'm the Wayne on fire I'll smash on your boo before a hot girl bang
What's happening with you?
