[Intro:]
Yeah, it's Bses Slwl I. on the track, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, trappin' getting old so I been movin' weight
Pigeons in the trunk, I'm on the interstate
Made myself a plug, get it 100 ways
And I still got the Act' you know I love the taste
Spending dirty money at the Gucci store
Fuckin' with the models, eating sushi rolls
She think I'm a singer, get that groupie love
Baby mama mad, she see me movin' up
On to bigger better things, with those television screens
I don't never get to see, cause I'm so heavy in the streets
I just blew a hundred thou', so I'm goin' outta town
And I'ma try to make it back all right

[Hook:]
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin

[Verse 2: ]
Ballin' in this bitch, I put my partners on
Tie you up and make you call your baby mama's phone
Tell that bitch to bring that bag, oh lord we need that bag
Xannies in a plastic bag, call that a sleeping bag
On MLK in a Bugatti, I feel free at last
Percocets, molly and syrup, I got PMS
Chillin' with your bitch watchin' First 48
And I still got the Act', you know I love the taste
And I let her hit the J, and I let her call me bae
And I let her call you back, just to get that out the way
Then she hang up in your face, then I get it on her face
And I teach her how to skate, then I skate, I'm straight...

[Hook: ]
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
(Ballin' in this bitch, I put my partners on)
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
(Muddy in this bitch, I'm talkin' styrofoam)
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
(Poppin' all these pills, I put my doctor on)
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
All my girl got is some heels and a lil towel on
