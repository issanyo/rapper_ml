[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I just broke up with my ex
Now I’m out here single, I don’t really know what’s next
But I ain’t even trippin', I'mma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right
And the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex and
You're the one I’m feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don’t normally say this but goddamn
You the best, best, best

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I say "Girl, you need a hot boy"
She say "you need to stop fuckin' with them thots, boy"
I say "You need a real nigga," she said, "Yes, Lord"
And what you need your ex for? I'm triple X, Lord
Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl
My ex tripping, it's no Biggie, I 2Pac, shook her
I'm laid up with my new thing, she lay her head on my new chain
Then the mood change, my name change from 'Lil Wayne' to 'Ooh, Wayne'
Oh Lord, she grinding on this Grande, oh Lord
I'm drowning, I'm gonna need that coast guard
And when it comes to that nigga, I give her amnesia
She just looking for love, she says she single and I'm her feature
Oh, my God

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Lil Wayne]
(You're no good, but it's time I love you, baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Tunechi, Mula baby
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
(But it's time I love you, yeah, yeah, ah)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
(I'm looking for love)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
(You're looking for love baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
(I'm looking for love babe)
She's just looking for love
She's just looking for love

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Ariana Grande]
I'mma give her that love
He gon' gimme that love
She's just looking for love
Boy, I'm looking for love, baby
I'mma give her that love
I'mma give her that...
I'mma give her that...
