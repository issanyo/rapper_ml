[Intro: Lil' Wayne]
I was in a BMW I was 16
I was pickin' up your hoe when I was 16

[Lil' Twist: Hook]
Well, I was in the Bugatti I was 16
Tellin' pussy niggas runnin' for a 16
And yeah, my attitude goofy but my wrist mean
I said my attitude goofy but my wrist mean

[Lil' Twist: Verse 1]
And yeah, it's Young Money forever, just like Mack said
And now I'm throwin up the ROC just like a crack head
I got these freaky bitches pullin' on my third leg
They got me throwin money out the fuckin drophead
I take this tooly, point it at a fuckin' iPad
And now my niggas hands on like an iPad
We hit your block in 7 minutes like the Uber do
Them 223 & thousand rounds straight through your Subaru

[Lil' Twist: Hook]
Well, I was in the Bugatti I was 16
Tellin' pussy niggas runnin' for a 16
And yeah, my attitude goofy but my wrist mean
I said my attitude goofy but my wrist mean

[Lil' Wayne: Verse 2]
I say my attitude moody and my mood bad
I bring it to your iPad to your new pad
Really don't know what I have, had to sue Dad
Well he been holding my allowance and I'm too mad
Mi say mi attitude moody and mi mood bad
I'm out here blessin' all mi goonies, I'm the goon god
They tunin' into Tunechi even though mi tunes odd
Upper class bout' to throw a class reunion
Bitch my skate stance's goofy
And my homeboy's spooky
And my side bitch crazy
Got my main bitch spooking
And my blood prices too sweet
And I'm right here on my two feet
And I ain't with that Birdman shit
And I pray for no more new wings
And I wear these skinny pants
Pocket plenty bands
Don't fuck skinny hoes
Do fuck pretty fans
On my own island
I feel like Gilligan
You are not invited
Oh but your bitch can stay, Yeah

[Lil' Twist: Hook] x2
Well, I was in the Bugatti I was 16
Tellin' pussy niggas runnin' for a 16
And yeah, my attitude goofy but my wrist mean
I said my attitude goofy but my wrist mean

[Lil' Wayne: Outro]
I was in a Bugatti I was 16
I was in a BMW I was 16
I was pickin' up your hoe when I was 16
I was fuckin' on your hoe when I was 16
She was bringin' you the work and I was 16
You thought I was in school cause' I was 16
But I was fuckin' on your hoe cause' I was 16
Yeah I was fuckin' on your hoe when I was 16
I was playin' with them pills when I was 16
I was playin' with that work when I was 16
I was playin' with your hoe when I was 16
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I was playin' with your hoe when I was 16
