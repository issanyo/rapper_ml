[Intro: Future and DJ Khaled]
We the motherfuckin best nigga
Remix motherfucker!
Ace Hood!
This the remix!

[Hook: Future]
I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating
(Turn Up!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
I woke up in a new Bugatti
Tats all over my body
Gettin' real money, niggas still hatin' on me
Man y'all need a new hobby
Or they won't talk to me, what they gon' say?
I ball, you a waterboy, Bobby Boucher
On top, toup√©e, y'all niggas fruitcakes
I don't really play games but I keep 2 K's
Damn, Mr. Hood why you do 'em like that?
Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, "Bugatti" done went gold
You ain't even know, I deserve that plaque
We the best, runnin' every summer in fact
July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy

[Hook]

I woke up in some new punani

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I was drunk as a bitch, drunk as a bitch
But not drunk as that bitch
I got in that shit acted donkey in it
Junk in her trunk, hope my trunk he can fit
Then she jumped on my dick like a monkey and shit
Monkey see monkey do, banana clips
Shoot at them niggas, no camera glitch
Wax that ass, no candle stick
And I run with some killers I eat with the mob
Got some shit built up I keep it inside
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high
Look dead in my eyes, see death in my eyes
The TEK on my thigh and my aim so good
I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye
Hold up, all bullshit aside
A nigga almost died but I'm outchea
Fuck around with a real nigga get murked
I been paid my dues will I get reimbursed?
Love it when she make faces
Pussy feel like vacation
Eat it like I'm dyin' of starvation
I'm at the finish line, her heart racin'
Give her the View, if she caucasion
My niggas wild as Jumanji
You can call me an S.O.B
Cause its skateboards over bugattis
I used to be at them Heat games
With better seats than Pat Riley
Don't stop, pop that don't stop
Pop that Ollie, Tunechi

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big
But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
Fuck underrated, I'm constipated
I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga
Made a way out of the jungle
And now they in trouble, I used to be humble as shit
Recently flooded my neck and my wrist
Tell all them critics to suck on the dick
Nigga
