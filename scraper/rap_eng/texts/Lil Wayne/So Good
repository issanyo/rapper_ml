I'm as real as they come, I follow the rules
I'm still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don't fuck around
I just felt they needed me, so I stuck around

Feds got my man, shit is real son
'Cause my god son just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn

Kush in the air, I'm pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don't sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill

Gasoline, propane, ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine
So in other words nigga, do your thing

Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he's just angry at you niggas
Who don't have your heart in your rap shit
And got too fucking comfy, 'cause we still fucking hungry

Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fucking faded, oh yeah I'm fucking faded
They telling lies about me, oh yeah I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol

But at least they had some bad bitches working in that shit hole
Ah, three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watching all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

Stop playing, I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches. Shanaynay, oh my goodness
This is Wayne's World, and y'all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish, you would bitch

Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock forties, nigga you got eight problems
Swimming in the money, I'mma need some fucking goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em

I just came home, shit then got real hoe
Lil Weezy-ana, the boot nigga, steal toe
I ain't working with a full deck but I deal hoe
I just touched down, kick the motherfucking field goal

Talking 'bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that 'how much you love your lady' money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga
I'll take you out, that's a date nigga

I'm a grown ass blood, stop playing with me
Play asshole and get an ass whipping
I think you pussy cat ha, hello kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin

I lay 'em down, tempur-pedic
This shit's a game of chess, you niggas think its cleavage
Its young money, yeah 'tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meeting

My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a fagot
Potato on the barrel, pop pop tater salad
