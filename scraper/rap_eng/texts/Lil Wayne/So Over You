[Lil Wayne:]
No regrets at all, I'm high and I hope you can catch the fall
Welcome to my lecture hall, you can't shake my infection off
Take me to your leader and, I promise I will be the man
Swim until I see the sand, then die as soon as I reach the land
The water's over our hands, what happened to our plans
Swim until I see the sand, then die as soon as I reach the land!

[Chorus:]
This is my resurrection, so fuck your resolution
I don't need no protection, I don't need your confusion
Don't know what to believe
Don't know what to believe
Don't know what to believe
Don't care what you believe
Cause I'm so over you, yeah I'm so over you
Yeah I fly over you, cause I'm so over you
[Shanell:]
Heeeey
I did everything by the book, book, book
Scribblin' (?) that I took, took, took
Find that you'll never (?)
Setting the setup to fall like the twins, you... struck
Show them a picture of my I.D
Better enough to prove that it's me
Look in the mirror
Now who should I...

[Chorus]
[Lil Wayne:]
Ha!
Don't know what to believe (huh)
Don't know what to believe (yeah)
Don't know what to believe (huh)
Don't care what you believe (yeah)
Don't know what to believe (huuuh)
Don't know what to believe (yeaaaaah)
Don't know what to believe (huuuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaah)
Yeaah!
Huh!
