[Verse 2]
What the blood klot?
What the blood klot?
Im in the two-door Benz Coupe with the bug eyes
Im in the two-door Benz Coupe, bumpin Thug Life
Im in a two cup congregration sippin mud slides (pour up)
211s at night, 187s broad daylight
Catch you at a red light, make it yo grave sight (bap bap)
Guns clappin so loud, give you stage fright
Banana clips look like a banana in a tail-pipe
And niggas in wheelchairs is half-dead
Niggas with real money is in the feds
They just ran in my house last week
Damn, I wasn't home I was in the streets
I ain't never home, I be in the streets
A money hound, giving hoes the runaround
It been fuck the world, it wanna cuddle now
I ain't fucking with them niggas cuz they funny style
I ain't fucking with them niggas cuz they funny style
I ain't fucking with them niggas cuz they funny style
100 pounds in the trunk, drove a 100 mile
Make a deal we drop it off and then we turn around
Hunt you down, take your shit and then we gun you down
I fix your frown, leave my footprints on your stomping ground
I feel my high coming down, roll another ounce
Hate when my hoes come in town unannounced

[Bridge]
I got my own ups and downs
You lil niggas dont do shit but make my stomach growl
Take a shower with your bitch and let her rub me down
She say you tiny but that dick looks like it muclebound
Give me the pussy, tear it up and down
Doing circles in the pussy I dont fuck around
Crash dummies better dumb it down
Better buckle up and stay buckled down
Smoking on the loud and we love the sound
Yeah, sweet as Gil Scott
Yeah, looking like guwap
Take a sip and pop a pill when the hook drop

[Hook]
When the hook drop
Take a sip and pop a pill when the hook drop
Dreadlock rasta, hair like pasta
Tunechi badman, rude boy, Imma shotta
Blowup


[Outro]
Dreadlock rasta, hair like pasta
Tunechi badman, rude boy, Imma shotta
Dreadlock rasta, hair like pasta
Tunechi badman, rude boy, Imma shotta
Blowup

Dreadlock rasta, hair like pasta
Imma rude, badman shotta
