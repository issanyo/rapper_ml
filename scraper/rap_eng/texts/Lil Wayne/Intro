(Mannie Fresh)
Have you ever met a balla in whole damn life
Wit plenty money, plenty bitches, and a whole lot of ice
I'm that nigga man, tha one they talkin about
I'm that nigga man, wit tha big ass house
Move over, Range Rover
I fuckin told ya

(Bullet Proof)
Bubba gotta brand new solja

(Mannie Fresh)
Who bought this bitch, Cash Money man
Let's start this bitch tha new hurricane
See tha niggas ain't gone like that
But tha bitches gone ride that

(Bullet Proof)
Big money is heavy weight
That's Fresh and Big B
Two uptown shinners, numba one stunna's
Fresh got a Berban, Baby got an all black Hummer
Bought a Jag for tha summer, green wit tan leather
TV's in tha head rest, 20's on tha compressor
So much ice in B's Roley you can't get a slow glance
He ain't have no money in his bank account till tha over flow came
My Uncle Prime got a 5 and it's top of tha line
19 inches cause 20's fucks up tha ride
I'm worth millions, I'm a balla dog
Rolex full of diamonds I'll blind ya dog
17 wit 7 cars I'm a shina dog
I'm an Uptown shina, neighborhood hunter
Red Hummer, Blue Hummer they both on chrome
Whoa!, I got a million minutes on my Prime Co. phone
I'm an Uptown shina, neighborhood hunter
Red Hummer, Blue Hummer they both on chrome
Whoa!, I got a million minutes on my Prime Co. phone
