Lil Wayne
4-4 bulldog my muthafuckin' pet
I point it at you and tell that muthafucka fetch
I'm fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy mouth and ass call that bitch triple threat
When I was in jail she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy imma starve her to death

Top down
It's upset
Been fuckin' the world and nigga I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check

Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep, so Weezy can't rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

Rick Ross
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car (ugh, ugh)
I got a chopper in the car (ugh, ugh)
I got a chopper in the car

Lil Wayne
Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, Remember Me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Rick Ross
Big black nigga in an icy watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch I got a Nike shop
Counts the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans kick 'em off they might be high

Swish!
I'm swimming in a yellow bitch (boss)
In a red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof till he got hit the fifth time

Drop Palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I'm the only one that paid your condo
Well connected got killers off in Chicago

I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car (ugh, ugh)
I got a chopper in the car (ugh, ugh)
I got a chopper in the car

Lil Wayne
Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, Remember Me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Talk stupid get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch I'm red fox
Big B's, Red Sox
I get money to kill time, dead clocks

You fuckin' with a nigga who don't give a fuck
Empty the clip, then roll the window up
Pussy-nigga sweet, you niggas Cinnabon
I'm in a red bitch, she said she finna cum

200 dolla on the chain, I don't need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy-E
Five letters: YMCMB

Bitch-ass nigga
Pussy-ass nigga
I see you lookin', what you lookin' at nigga
You know the rules: kill 'em all and keep movin'
If I died today, it'd be a holiday, huh

Rick Ross
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car so don't make it come alive
Rip yo ass apart, then I pull myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever (huh)

The bigger the bullet the more that bitch go bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini 'till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, pocket gain and forty bricks

Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape
Ain't it funny momma, only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm Santa Claus
Niggas gather round, got gifts for each and all of y'all

Take it home and let it bubble that's the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fuckin' up
It's a cold world, I need a bird to cuddle up
I call the plays, muthafucka' huddle up

Lil Wayne
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car
