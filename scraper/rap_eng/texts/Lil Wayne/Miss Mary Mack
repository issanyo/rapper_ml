[Intro: Juicy J]
North Memphis in the buildin'
Rich niggas in the buildin'
Fired up

[Hook: August Alsina]
Mrs. Mary Mack, all rolled in pack, roll up
With that sweet kush, all down her back
Mrs. Mary Mack, all rolled in pack, roll up
She let me hit, straight from the back
And oh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her
And oh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Fuckin' with her since a young nigga
Smokin' more weed than these young niggas
One more hit then I'm done with her
But who am I kiddin'? I'm in love with her
I'm addicted to her, she know I can't live without her
Mary Jane is all I need
In the Lambo blowin' nothin' but that kill
You know I keep this RIP
I chief and y'all little niggas ain't in my league
I got them Kobe Bryant colors all in my weed
Pourin' up the purple plus, homie let's make a toast
Whole team doublin' up on cups of lean
Blue dream weed make my bitch go by
Got her layin' on her back, with her legs up in the sky
I'mma take me a dab and watch that ass
Stay on my triple shit nigga, I'm so high
I'm so fly, check my ride
Shit's so clean, chick thought I was a spy
007, I'm James Bond
And I'm smokin' kebowls all out my bong
All I inhale is that strong
So you know I keep the grass all in my lungs
Mrs Mary Mary, roll it back to back
On a shot of gin and a beam on my tongue

[Hook: August Alsina]
Mrs. Mary Mack, all rolled in pack, roll up
With that sweet kush, all down her back
Mrs. Mary Mack, all rolled in pack, roll up
She let me hit, straight from the back
And oh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her
And oh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I don't smoke it if it ain't that good, nope
Fuck that nigga, I'm gravy, yeah
Fucked up nigga, I'm wavy, uh
Cotton mouth nigga, post slavery, ooh
Stop talkin' shit nigga, smoke somethin'
Girl let's bust one and roll one
Tunechi like a penny with a hole in it
Cause I don't let these bitches get they hopes up
I got Tony Montana, no cut
I gets all my drugs for free
Cause I got a bad bitch, she a nurse
And I just tell that bitch I can't sleep
I only drink on occasions
When it is not an occasion?
Chinky eyes, Asian persuasion
Fuck rehab-ilitation
I say, "God is great, weed is good"
Amen to that shit
Rest in peace Lord Infamous
Amen to that shit
Light that hoe I pass around
I hope my smoke go past the clouds
To all my homies lookin' down
Amen to that shit

[Hook: August Alsina]

And oh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her
And oh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her
