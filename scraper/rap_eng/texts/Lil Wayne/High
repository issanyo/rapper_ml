[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
One-ninety proof, sub-nine in a shiny coupe
Up-towners inside the booth, shut down anybody who
Come 'round with a lolly gag, leave found in a body bag
Legs stiff, toes green, give him a title tag
Flossy nigga, but there lies a killer behind the flesh
Bossy nigga, so presidential thanks to my dad
Gotta add, how I got four states to call a pad
I'm mad as a mothafucker, why? I'm rich!
Buy a bag brotha, get a nigga high, I'm lit

Unless ya Weezy F Baby
And, please say the Baby when say it, mothafucker

Rock n' roll, we can rock to my pad, yeah
Cold Saki shots, chilled Petrone, half a glass, yeah
Whoa, now she hot, now it's on, now she bent
I let her clothes drop, while she goin' to my bed
And I'm goin to my bed right behind her
Got a couple questions in her pussy
I picked the night to find 'em
And, I might define 'em if, I hit from right behind her
And get her how I got her, now she diggin' my persona
She, like a virgin, but, like Madonna
I don't believe her at all, I'm just tryna ride ya
Until the seats fall off, but we good
This is Cash Money, Young Money, get it understood
