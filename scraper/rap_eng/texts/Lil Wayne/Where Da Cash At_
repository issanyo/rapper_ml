[Verse 1: Currency]
Bitches Come A Dime A Dozen, I fuck 'Em Sistas Cuzzins
It's A Revolvin Door pussy Go And pussy Comin
And When It Go To You it's Comin Back To Me Wit Money
I Tell Her Put Some Shoes On And Keep My Paper Runnin
I Put My Mack, Downnnn Just Like A G Supposed To
And If She don't Come Home Wit It Than She Sleepin Over
I Got Her Creepin Over, We Do It Than it's Over
I Like Them A'Maries, You Can Have Them Amarosas
Them niggas Down Below Us, Baby We Up And Over
I'm Tryin To Get Inside That Thang That Sit Between Ya Shoulders
I'm Talkin Large Totals, I'm Talkin Large Motives
I'm Talkin Burner Rubber That Melted Pirelli Odor
I'm Hoppin Out Unoticed, You Lookin At My Biiitch
You Wanna Holla You Can Holla Take Her On A Trip
But When The Deed's Done, You Gotta Send Her Back...

See I Know He Gotta Man But I'm Coofey In The Otha One
Cuz He can't Get Tight, When He Hear I Pipped Anotha One
I don't Fall In Love With Them, Come And Than I'm Done With Them
Most They Get From Me, Is Wet pussy And Some Bubble Gum
