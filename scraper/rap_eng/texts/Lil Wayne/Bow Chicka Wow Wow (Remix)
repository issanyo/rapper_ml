[Intro: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over girl

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I hear you knock knock knock baby come on up
I hope you got got got something in yo' cup
Cause I'm three shots deep and I ain't tryna sleep
Get your Redbull on cause I'm ready
You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want right
Don't tell me what you wanna do
Tell me what you gon' do
Whatchu gon' do

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this
Bow chicka wow wow
Whatchu gonna say?
Act like you gon' leave
When I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky down down
Girl don't even play
Once I set the mood right
I'mma make it sound like
I'mma make it sound like

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Are you tryna make me wait wait wait 'til the second day
But I can't can't can't even contemplate
Waiting one more minute lemme jump in it
I brought you flowers and a teddy
You've been playin hard to get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want right
Don't tell me what you wanna do
Tell me what you gon' do
Whatchu gon' do

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this
Bow chicka wow wow
Whatchu gonna say?
Act like you gon' leave
When I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky down down
Girl don't even play
Once I set the mood right
I'mma make it sound like
Yeah I can make it sound like

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
I got a leather couch and a black mic
And we all alone, what it sound like?
The night was dead, we found life
I know I talk shit, but it sound right
You say you can't but that's unfair
Gotta give something, something gotta give
I bet you love it, I win the bet
Now we laying up, cigarettes

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Now, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive, girl you know you like that
Say, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive, girl you know you like that

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this
Bow chicka wow wow
Whatchu gonna say?
Act like you gon' leave
When I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky down down
Girl don't even play
Once I set the mood right
I'mma make it sound like
Yeah I'mma, yeah I'mma  make it

[Outro: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over girl
