[Intro: Cuchi Shop Customer, Cuchi Shop Employee, and Nicki Minaj]
Welcome to Star Box
Yeah shorty, I'm trying to get me some thick thighs and some chinky eyes
I need a real good box
Oh ok
A real good box
Okay, hey, yo Nick!
Yo?
Yeah, shorty out here wants a #3
Oh, alright tell him to come around to my window, I got him, it's nothin'
Oh alright
And yo, you know the slogan right?
Yeah, I know how it goes
Pussy by any means

[Hook]
First I take their order at the Cuchi Shop
Then I send 'em a girl that can make her coochie pop
And then I smuggle all my money through the coochie spot
Up in the Phantom, have you wishing you had 'em, I'm the madam

And there ain't no returns at the Cuchi Shop
We don't wanna hear it burns at the Cuchi Shop
Just listen and you'll learn at the Cuchi Shop
Up in the Phantom, have you wishing you had 'em, I'm the madam

[Verse 1]
What you need thick thighs and some chinky eyes
Super size all your sides like your biggie fries
For a better price you can get some better pie
Strawberry, apple, cherry, even lemon lime
What you want them B cups or them C cups?
For your ice cream, chocolate or butter P cups
French vanilla threesomes that come in D cups
They eat each other but otherwise they don't eat much
I'm bout that fast money, money ain't got no patience
But if them boys come, run like you on probation
Listen up, I'm a send ya to the location
Write it down, take a picture, make a notation

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Relax lil' nigga cut the bull, cut it out
We tax niggas no deductible, get it out
So what it is, what it ain't, nigga state ya name
You know we got them umbrellas if you make it rain
So what you want them good girls or them bad ones
I got them girls make you wish ya never had none
Cause you'll be spending beaucoup in my spot, shorty
This nigga acting brand new like he just bought it
Up and away like Mighty Mice
You can say I am the rap game Heidi Fleiss
Cause my flow crazy, Hussein like Sadam
You getting it, I got 'em, I'm the rap bitch madam
I'm the madam

[Hook]
