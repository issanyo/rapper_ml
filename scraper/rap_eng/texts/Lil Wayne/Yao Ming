[David Banner]
Hello its Mr. David Banner, your bitch eater
I suggest that you dont kiss or hug her and dont eat her
I Run DMCs in this bitch in my adidas
I was chose to expose when you chose as a leader
Yes Im fresh like a rose picked from the garden of Eden
Im stepped out the rose my game rose like Easter
I got a couple bitches thats painted like Mona Lisa
Now I fuck em at my leisure and i never touch my visa
So ghetto, my kicks so retro, got nuts like a rhino, call them Mark Echo
You know I ain't braggin, Im just sayin
I know yall said it too, cuz yall niggas playin
Bitch

[Chorus]
And bitch Im tall as Yao Ming
And bitch Im tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy (x4)
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy (x4)
[2 Chainz]
Lets make a toast to the breadwinner
I am so damn hot on the scale winter
Life a bitch, Ill dance with her
All up in the sand with her
Try to get up in the bed with her
And put my third leg in her
Oh Ive been pumpin pussy like gas, nigga
Got my fofo, youll get 8 like math nigga
Still use a shoe box for my stash nigga
Money so tall you gone need a drug round with ya
Self esteem high like 26
You can catch me gettin high with like 20 bitches
Takein plenty pictures, yea you know Im camera ready
Im about to wax that ass I got my camera ready

[Chorus]
Look at my daddy (x4)
And bitch Im tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy (x4)
And bitch Im tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy (x4)
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy (x4)
[Lil Wayne]
Ok, traffic on Mars, smokin in a spaceship
Bright red flag stickin out like fake lips
Im forever young, forever Young Mula
Bitch, cash money is an army, oorah
Tunechi be what they call me
Im everything but sorry
Get a bad ass high yellow bitch to come and ride my horse
I named it Charlie
No cream in my coffee, dont bleed on my carpet
I falls in love with all these hoes, but its money over bitches regardless
Im so high I won't come down, boy my pack be dumb loud
Waiting for one of these niggas to cross the line, like a touchdown
I gotchu, Im Piru, bitch Im out there by you
Blade on the AK, cut your ass like high school
David banner on the beat, bitch, dig it like a deep ditch
I got the world in my hands Im about to make a fist
Ha, I stand tall as Yao Ming!
Blocka pow pow ping must be New Orleans!

[Chorus]
