[Into: Lil Wayne]
No ceilings
Haaa, yeah!

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Party on the beach
P-Party on the beach
Party animal, they done let me off the leash
I got my weed from the west
My pills from the east
And two bottles of Goose, that's Geese

[Hook: Mack Maine]
No ceilings
(No ceilings muthafucka'!)
Tonight's gonna be a good night
Tonight's gonna be a good night
Tonight's gonna be a good good night

No ceilings
Tonight's gonna be a good night
Tonight's gonna be a good night
Tonight's gonna be a good good night

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tonight's the night, I’m high as height
I'm young and restless, I shines my guiding light
And uh, I’m living right, my health alright
My money good and my girl a dyke
Shit, let's live it up, no dying down
Lets shoot the bar, I’ll buy the rounds
I’ll take the shots, I’m bulletproof
Nike just do it, I do what it do
I was drinking 'fore I came
When I got here, I did the same
I don't like beer, I like champagne
So, cheers to Lil Wayne
And if she think she get my number, just hope my number don’t change
Girl stop playing, I got that pussy on a string
Now let’s do it!

[Bridge]
Let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it (No Ceilings)
And do it, and do it, let’s live it up (yeah)
And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it (ahaha)
Let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it (Young Mula babbbyyy)

[Hook]
No Ceilings (woo, hah)
Tonight’s gonna be a good night (No Ceilings)
Tonight’s gonna be a good night (motherfucker)
Tonight gonna be a good good night (Young Money)
No Ceilings
Tonight’s gonna be a good night (Now I’m about to really go in)
Tonight’s gonna be a good night (I’m going in!)
Tonight’s gonna be a good good night (Scoob I see you)
No Ceilings

[Verse 2]
Kush got my dutch fat as fuck
Weezy F, I’m bad as luck
I’m already at the top, I'm 'bout to pull the ladder up
Flow crazy, I need a counselor
I’m hip-hop's announcer
I’m in the gun club, do you wanna meet the bouncer?
Been a beast and still I am
Now I rock and still I jam
Few niggas with me got that white girl like Will.I.Am
Look up bitch, ain't no ceilings
See me at the top controlling things
Anybody beat, it's a motherfucking murder scene
I do it

[Hook]
