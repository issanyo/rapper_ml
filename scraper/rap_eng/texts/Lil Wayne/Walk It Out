Drought 3
Look
I bought it out like stunna
I hope when we kiss we make u sick to yo stomach
Stunning like my daddy
And yo momma eat rubbers
I bet i can do da mouf 2 mouf with yo woman
My house is a dungeon
Yellow diamond ring lookin like a little funyon
Stand on my toes you can call me Paul Bunin
Touchin up my flows like a nigga do construction
Da microfone wet cuz my words like seduction
N when we on the jet you dnt come up on da discussion
And if you say you ballin we prolly dont trust ya
I know freakin hoes dat prolly dnt f**k ya
Even if you pay em boy they prolly won't f**k ya
Only if i say dat she can touch ya like busta
Then she might touch ya
And burn ya like usher
Me n my click we red like blush
I shit these rappers out and sometimes i forget 2 flush ya
Grand daddy purp or bubble kush crush ya
Explode in a bitch mouf like a gusher
Cash money young money
Check da production
I am just a martian
Get prepared for abduction
Haha

Haha

Uuum...
I walk it out like crutches
2 girls jump me like double dutchers
My nigga t-streets know a girl named dutches
And everytime we see her in da streets she b cussin
I told em he should wave da black flag cuz she buckin
He said the pussy good

He said ya digg
So i dugg em
Im lookin for a real bad bitch wit a husband
I give em a whole lotta dick
And a whole lot of nuttin
Im spittin like i stumbled on a gold pot of sumthin
And when i was 6 i saw my rolemodel hustlin
So i gotta hustle
These rappers talkin bout a whole lot of nuttin
You drop me on saturday i sold out on sunday
F**k is da argue bout
Nigga da carter out
This is what i call da drought....3
N we dont walk it out
We drop top porch it out
They better walk em out
Before we chalk em out
We chalk it out (x7)
We chalk em out
They dnt want it na uh
No they dnt want it na uh
You see they frontin im not
Oh yeah they frontin im not
I east side walk it out
I bring New Orleans out
I am a saints fan
Oh yea you know we marchin out
Like were a saints band
I play the organs now
And if they talk
Most likely im what they talkin bout
My nigga t from da east roll out dat forest now
Man im just tryin 2 get my peanuts im like charlie brown
Ok da uzi make dat holy sound
Take 2 of these and walk around
Come straight from that homeless town it -- belong to carter now
