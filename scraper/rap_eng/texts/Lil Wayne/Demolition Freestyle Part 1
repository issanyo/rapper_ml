[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Bodybag the beat, to tag the highs
More braggin' rights
If you ain't actin right, send you to after life
I'm the action type, shoot, mash and fight
I ball like Steve Nash and shoot past the light
And jump all in the freak ass, she gettin' smashed tonight
I'm a vulture nigga, slicker than a snake, I'm a fool
I'm a ape and you food, I am rapin' you fools
Murk shit, on the track I molest you rappers
Wayne and Gudda, who wanna contest the rappers ?
No bodies, 4 shotties, get the job done
No problem, I been a beast since squad one
My money runnin' like Sonic the Hedgehog
And for the bread dog, I'm like Adolph
Hitler, gimme the money or meet the sizzler
I'mma toaster like Strudels, Ima burn these niggas
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I don't wanna talk about it
Gangsta shit right in front you, nigga walk around it
Nigga let me do me, they know I kick it like Jet Li, Bruce lee
And I've done what they can't do me
I'll put my gun up to your Aunt Suzie
And blow out a doobie, paint her ruby
I am a looney, you niggas puny
I puke on the beat, I juke and never fumble
Man I spit that dope, like I swallowed a bundle
Gotta spit that dope up
Cause the old heads said if you don't it'll bust
Heard if I sell it hard it'll rush
But if them people come if its soft it'll flush
Certainly
Don't get caught in the blind and keep yo curtain straight
No I don't drink wine but I smoke purple grape
Sometimes see purple stars, and I ain't talkin' about purple Bapes
I gets paid early cause I be workin' late
Too many painful memories shit hurt to say
Crack flow no bake, just stir and shake
Shootin' when we pull up like Urkel waist
Sip syrup got me movin' at a turtle pace
But quick draw pop out like a turtle face
Paid in full, you can't murk the ace
I kill the beat and beat the murder case
That's right, I'mma kill this shit
And if the glove don't fit, I'mma need a catchers mitt
Cause I'm high like a pitch, yeah I'm high like a pitch
Like Mariah and shit, I guess I'm higher than a bitch
Keep it dirty like I'm lyin' in the ditch
Like Eli I'm from New Orleans, I'm a Giant in this bitch
Move the G and add an S and put the I before the N
And put the A in front of that, and that's what I am to the end
That's a Saint muthafucka, simplify it for them
Where your funeral comes with a 2nd line at the end
Yeah, but you won't be second linin' with them
Cause you be in the hearse that's behind all of them
Yeah, I see your homies dressed in black like they finna ride
But that fashion statement, is tellin' a lie
I'm pelican fly, mac 11 inside
My bullets come with wings and your cerebellum can fly
Yeah fuckin' right oh yeah, Young Money we are, sick as gonorrhea
Like nausea, heart burn, indigestion, upset stomach and diarrhea
Get some Pepto Bismol ho!
