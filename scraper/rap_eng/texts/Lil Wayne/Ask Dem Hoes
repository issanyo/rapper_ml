See, she all on my dick
Cause I make a lot of money
But I don't know why
Cause she gets none; bring it back
All on my dick

Way down in her tummy
And she tell all of her friends
Now her friends wanna; bring it back

Ms. MySpace
Don't blow my high

To your hard drive
Then she got on her knees
That's when we locked eyes
She caught it
Like it was a routine pop fly
I'm dope boy fresh
New jeans, new everything
Them bitches want me like a wedding ring
I told her that I'm married to the money
Committed to the cash
All I see is pussy, titties, and the ass

[Verse 3]
Call me Weezy F., bitch
I'm straight from the street
The dope game is sour
And the dope is sweet
I live in the towers
Got a scope on the heat
Hit you from 100 feet
We don't even have to meet
Ya bitch love me
We don't even have to meet
But if I run into her
Believe me I will; hold on
Ya bitch love me
We don't even have to meet
But if I run into her
Believe me I will do her
And if that bitch is crazy
Believe me I will sue her
Got some hungry-ass lawyers
That will eat her up and chew her
I don't know how you love her
I wish I never knew her
She only gave me brain
She was just another tutor
She blew my whole band
I was just another tuba
Now get off my dick
And get lost in Aruba
It's money over bitches
Cash Money over bitches
Young Money over bitches
Get money from them bitches
I do!

[Hook]
