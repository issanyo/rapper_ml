[Verse 1: Tyga]
Listen, Listen y'all wanna hear a story here it go
Sexual, she’s so X-rated where the kids can’t go
Think so, I know so experienced a week ago
Expedia.com to her throat, but still classy though
Which bothered me, like Amish people in my area code
3-1-0, Tyga man for her ringtone
So I never call her when she’s home, only cell phone
She hate it when I put her on hold, especially for other hoes, (Im Sorry)
Say wait, I’m a rapper and it runs in the family
Young Money family, GED family
I’m average, accepting all challenges
Sexy can I feel you with this camera and Kardashian ya…
And I don’t need no hook for this shit
Tyga Tyga man only wanna hit! (I do, I do)
I don’t need no hook for this shit, (no, no, no!)
I’m just tryna hit, like I can’t miss!

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
Girl come over here let me whisper in your ear
And say the type of things that have you dripping like a tear
So I can treat it like a car crash and hit you from the rear
And leave your man mad cause you been missing for a year
Chea, Peep the youngin swag
You heard a bunch of braggin’
But she ain’t ever had nobody hit it like a punchin’ bag
You ain’t never got smashed in the backseat of a drop Jag
Legs in the air, while the cops pass
She tried to tell me that she never did a rapper
So I pulled out my lollipop and let her lick the rapper (What up Wayne)
And I never kiss her after, I pass her to my dawgs
Yeah, they like lottery numbers
Girl you have to hit ‘em all
See, first they start to choose
Now probably pussy’s oozin’
In a second, I'mma have her naked like Marques Houston
Yep, you messin’ with the boy of Houston
Robert Davis in my cup so let’s start this screwin’ (Sing to ‘em Short)
And I don’t need no hook for this shit, (oh yeah? And why’s that?)
Cause she gon’ let me hit(she gon’ let me hit)
Yep, she gon’ let me hit (she gon’ let me hit)
Yep, she gon’ let me hit!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, ummm
Uh, uh, uh, uh, ummmmm
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh – (laughs)
Ok, now shawty take your clothes off
And I'mma hit it, I'mma hit it ‘till we doze off
And when we wake up I'mma hit it ‘till we doze off
She say her pussy is the spot
And Im like if that’s the case I'mma beat it like Johnnie Cochran
And I’m a rock it like Houston I’m leanin’
Ain't nothin’ between me and you but this bikini
Now can I take it off ya
Rub my tongue across ya
I do it so right
She called me an author
But I am just a Carter
Yeah I’m just a Carter
Straight to the Carter
Yeah, that’s where I Raw it up
And I swear I'mma make her cheer like victory
Shawty, shawty you can get speared like Britney, literally!
And I don’t need no hook for this shit
Im just tryna hit it, hit it like I can't miss!
Shawty I don’t need no hook for this shit
Im just tryna hit it, hit it like I can't miss!
