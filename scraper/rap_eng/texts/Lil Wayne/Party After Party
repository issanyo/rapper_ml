[INTRO]

Oh (oh oh oh oh)

[VERSE 1]
Roll out, downtown
Crash the warehouse
Makin' my way through the crowd
Where's the DJ?

Hit the...
Playback on my new track
Before we
Jet back to the crash bad
(Blast that!)
Ch'mon at ten, me and my friends
At my place gettin' crazy

[Chorus]

Don't bring ya money
Just bring ya body
All night long
(Party after party)
Ready or not
You're not gonna stop
We're gonna shake the town up
(Party after party)

[POST-Chorus]

Whoa oh [2x]
(Rock 'til ya drop!)
Party after party
Whoa oh [2x]
('Til the sun comes up)
Party after party

[VERSE 2]

We take five to sunset
From the valley
We make a...
Quick stop to fill up
Bumpin' to Chelsea

Hear the ringtone
On my bro's phone
I'm gonna meet them
At the troubadour
Front door
Kings of Leon playin' my song
I'm gonna use somebody
Through the break of dawn

[Chorus]

[BRIDGE:]

We-don't-want
This-night-to-end
So-let's
Keep-going
Only-got
One-life-to-live
So-let's
Keep-rollin'

We-don't-want
This-night-to-end
So-let's
Keep-going
Only-got
One-life-to-live

[OUTRO]

SO LET'S GO!
