[Bridge]
Just like at Pizza Hut, I serve your order
And might I just mention, I just met yo' mother (Boom)
Her nose is humongous, Mr. Krabs' Daughter (Bitch)
She got a big head like on the fuckin' quarter (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Top rope (Ayy)
Swingin' in the pussy, Rey Mysterio (Swingin' in the)
619 to her pussy hole (Pussy hole)
Bite-bite (Bite-bite)
Hit it too hard, she might cry-cry (Bitch)

[Intro]
Yuh, VR lifestyle, lil' bitch (VR, bitch)
Gling, what the fuck, stop
May I, come get
Your auntie neck 'bout as long as a NASCAR race, nigga
Listen up, lil' boy
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Hot boy I might need a ceiling fan (It's hot)
Peter Pan fly hot like summer tan (Sing it)
Popeye, flex strong, spinach can (Flex, flex)
Your diamonds dirty (Wet, flex)
Look at this, dirty dan, ayy
Nutter and butter
Is what I left on the chin of yo' mother (Chin)
Fuck with two bitches, that be my wishes
I'm feelin' like Danny Glover (Two bitches)
Under the covers, handin' me out
Damn, that lil' bitch's a slugger (White back)
Some of my niggas is still sellin' dimes
Dodge a cop car like itâ€™s Frogger (Frogger)
Dick in her mouth like a Black & Mild
When I fuck doggy style I be like roof (Stank)
I'm a clown, but yo' bitch like my style (Wet, flex)
Fuck a damn camel toe, she got a hoof
No, I'm not a cook
I'm Ratatouille, spilled sauce on my foot (Cook)
Just like my right, I'm a hook
I want the booty like I'm Captain Hook

[Chorus]
Rest in peace to Bernie (Rest in)
So I got a mac (Got it)
Red dot like a red light (Bitch)
Stop him, heart attack (Woo)
Talkin' cray, talkin' cray, Kevin Hart
He gon' learn today (Bitch)
Ski's flow clean like a LeBron fadeaway (Look at it, look at it)
Ayy

Bite-bite (Bite)
Hit it too hard, she might cry-cry (Okay)

[Verse 2]
Eat on that pussy like bath salts (Bitch)
'Til I make a million not takin' my durag off (Bitch, bitch)
Chain on me wet like I put Axe on
Niggas be some pussies just like in the show Cat-Dog
Fuck on your mother with slacks on (Look at it)
When she be doin' that back talk (Back talk)
B-Mac I just spilled some sauce though, ayy
Shout-out my parents and Rick Ross hoe, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Rest in peace to Bernie (Bernie)
So I got a mac (Got my mac)
Red dot like a red light (Hit 'em)
Stop him, heart attack (Pussy hoe)
Talkin' cray, Kevin Hart
He gon' learn today
Ski's flow clean like a LeBron fadeaway (Bitch)
Rest in peace to Bernie (Come here)
So I got a mac (Alright)
Red dot like a red light
Stop him, heart attack (Wait, wait)
Talkin' cray, Kevin Hart
He gon' learn to-fuckin'-day (Yup)
Ski's flow clean, like a LeBron fadeaway

[Outro]
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, woo, woo

Ayy ayy ayy
