[Bun B]

Yeah, when I step in the spot motherfuckers say "Who dat?"
Big Bun B, but you already knew that
Live from the state, where they chop and they screw that
You hatin' on a Trill OG, when they do dat?
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix, man, just gon' get you stuck deep in the quicksand
With no easy fix, man
No Trix man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with DA so you know what it is
I'm sittin' on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in a golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps that hold 'em back, let's go

[Nas]

L-l-look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that aspired lyrical tyrants
Like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to "The Essence"
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man attested
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
But I'm like a gastric bypass
Bunch of Nas African actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old, yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov
Tats on my body like an art exhibit, I did real good for a project, nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden, I was real young, little youth
A novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow-pow, with my shooters are Techs
Bust louder than the noise I just spit
Let's get one thing straight, that my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry the 8th, guillotine to your neck, bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied cowards that made power moves
Watched Wild Planet, seen lions devour food, you can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne, let them niggas hate
I love my nigga Drake say "We ain't got time to respond to niggas"

[Shyne]

I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta when I pop up with
