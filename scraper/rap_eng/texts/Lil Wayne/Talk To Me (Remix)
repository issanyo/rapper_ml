[Intro: DJ Stevie J & Lil Wayne]
Ayo, Tory!
I told you we was gon' do the remix, nigga
Got it on smash
Easy Stevie, easy
Remix, baby

[Chorus: Tory Lanez, Lil Wayne & DJ Stevie J]
Talk to me, baby (Talk)
You’s a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (Remix)
You's a prissy little missy, baby (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let ’em drop to the floor, oh

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Talk to me, baby, talk to me, talk to me
Say "it's all" for me, then get on, then get off of me
That is all for me, ain't got no more love to offer me
Watch your tone for me, how you talk to me, softly
You gon' touch yourself, get off for me
What you want from me? Got your thoughts running
Heart pumping, and your skull jumping
You gon' fall for me, you gon' cut a bitch and brawl for me
Whole bunch of missed calls from me, that's withdrawal, honey
Let that nigga give you mall money, it won't solve nothing
I take you shopping in all countries, buy your dog something
When you go topless in drawers for me, look like art to me
The way you sound when you talk to me, sound like harmony
Talk to me

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Lil’ Wayne]
Talk to me, baby (Talk to me)
You’s a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Talk to me)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
I want you to talk to me, baby (Talk)
You’s a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh

[Post-Chorus: Tory Lanez & Lil Wayne]
Let her go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go (Remix, baby)
Girl, I'll race you to the floor, tell her go (Tory Lanez)
Tell the crew, I got money, I'm the one you wanna know (Lil Tory)

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Look, when I drip
You can slip, you know
Yeah, I talk shit
I’m hella rich, ya know
Yellow bone chick
And she hella thick, you know
I'm fucking them superstars
This ain't one of them chicks you know
I got a kid right by the Bri
I got a chick, her name Christina
Know who to meet when I need a
New two-seater , two new divas
Know who to greet when I need some brand new weed
It's two new reefers
Know who to see when I need some brand new freaks
It's two new skeezers right there
Pop up on ya like, yeah
Buzzing like I'm Lightyear
Ain't see me in a lightyear
I pull up and I put my dick inside your chick, yo' nightmare
Got it on my shirt, it might smear
But that mean she cumming, and it's right there, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I can spoil you wit' these big racks (Racks)
She got good head (Head) and she eat her cornbread (Cornbread)
The Wraith red, Ben Frank, my friends dead (Yeah)
I don't wanna miss it, I love the money, I don't wanna kiss you
The pussy official, I fuck her one time and her face in a pillow
It's a one night ting, my diamonds fighting
This not no Breitling, that pussy biting
I tell her to talk to me (Talk to me)
The plug gon' walk with me (Plug)
Ooh, she bougie, she busy (Busy)
Fuck it, might buy her a Bentley (Bentley, fuck it)
Go (Go), go to the floor and pick up (And pick up)
She callin' my phone, might pick up (Brr)
She too bad, I might miss her (Rich)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
