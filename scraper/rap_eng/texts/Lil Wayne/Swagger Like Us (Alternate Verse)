No one on the corner have swagger like I
Too cool for school, fly boy high
I drop out like I fell, from the sky
Hold up, let me wipe the cloud off my eye
He has class, first in the lunch line
My lunch ticket let my eat rappers at lunch time
Swagger, shinin' brighter than sunshine
Misfit, duck in the fashion one time
No one on the corner has swagga like moi, Church
But I'm too clean for the choire
I require what I desire I earn my stripes, Adidas
Mami scream papi no mas
Run up in your house just me; no mas
Runnin this bitch like I got four thighs
No one like swagger like these four guys!
