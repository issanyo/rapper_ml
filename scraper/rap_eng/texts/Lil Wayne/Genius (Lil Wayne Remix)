[Intro: Sia]
Wayne

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I'm a genius, under question, no question, I'm really special
Upper echelon when I bless you, molest you with intellectual
It's a pleasure, it gets sexual, women lemon complexion
Quick connections, then ejections, my love is so ambidextrous
I'm a genius, imperfectionist, specialist in the excesses
With excellence forever, there's necklaces for irrelevance
In the room, I'm the elephant, spellin' it for the hell of it
A-B-C-D-R-U-G-H-I-J-K-L-S-D

[Pre-Chorus: Sia, Labrinth & Lil Wayne]
Oh, my God
Baby, baby, don't you see? (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I got everything you need (Mulah)
O-only a genius could love a woman like she
Oh, my God
Baby, baby, don't you see? (Yeah)
I got everything you need (Yeah, yeah)
O-o-only a genius could love a woman like she

[Chorus: Labrinth, Sia & Lil Wayne]
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius (Genius, baby)
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A-B-C-D-R-U-G-H-I-J-K-L-S-D, ha!

Sia

[Verse 2: Sia]
Oh!
Youâ€™ll be my Einstein, my Newton, my Galileo, and my Hawking
Boy, put that pep in my step
Put your arm on my neck while I'm walking
Please understand, yeah I have fallen for you, you
What, what you say?

[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth, Sia & Lil Wayne]
Oh, my God
Baby, baby don't you see?
I got everything you need
O-only a genius could love a woman like me
Sayin' oh, my God (My God)
Baby, baby, don't you see? (Yeah)
I got everything you need (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
O-o-only a genius could love a woman like me

[Chorus: Labrinth, Sia & Lil Wayne]

A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius (Yeah)
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
