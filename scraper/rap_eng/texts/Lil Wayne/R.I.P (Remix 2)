[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

Bitch say my name; Carter, Tunechi, Wayne
Sunny skies, but I'mma make it rain
Welcome to my life, word to my nigga Game
Killin these hoes, call that a bloodbath
On fire like Lloyd Banks, bitch where the Bloods at
Rockin' ice, I'm skatin'
Tell me why they hatin, bad bitches worship
Call me Satan, motorboatin' in the motorboat
Nigga that's smoke in the water, Radiohead
Blow to the music, smokin' on that deep purple
Know how to raise a cock, bitch you raised on a farm?
Sip so much,niggas tell me lean back like Fat Joe
Body covered in tattos, call me Kid Ink
Bitch got a bad ass, goin' upp up and away
Young Money captain, make your ship sink
Pussy like magic, tada

Me and Mustard, you niggas better catch up
Dick hard as wood, Tiger
Compton in the bulding, Tuga

[Verse 3: E-40]

Ohh, T-Raww just killed it
Don't think y'all niggas can clench my realness
I'm from the Bay, my Spike Lee's slap all day
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, super fly Cali boastin'
Burnin' rubber, big pimpin'
Biaytch slow down, I'm chillin in buldin' with my nigga Clyde Carson
Leave with at least a nine every time fosho, can't deny my shine
Smell me on the block, give you niggas a brochure

Flippin' in the kitchen, nigga I'm trappin'
Fuck her so good it's a bad habit, yeah it's a bad habit
Addin' zeros like mathmatics, nigga I'm different
Word to 2 Chainz, team rollin' to the bank
All my niggas laughing, kush got us oup in the rafters
All my hoes ratchet, they tools
Bitch all on my Johnson, magic
Goin' dumb in the club, niggas better go back to school
Crib in uptown, garage with two Bugatti's and a Maserati

Real nigga, put yo ass in a casket
Don't fuck with me, R.I.P

[Outro: MGK]

Killin' every club, R.I.P. to yo city bitch
