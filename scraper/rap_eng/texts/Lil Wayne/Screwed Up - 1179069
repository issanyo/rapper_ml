Target practice baby. Only thing is I'm not the shooter, Im the bullet, BIAATCH!!!
G'd up from the feet up
A-B-C D-E-F

(Verse 1: Lil Wayne)
I'm a G to the end the end of the road
B-back in the kitchen at the end of the stove
A T looks like we at the end of the O... drop a fo
In the 20 ounce call it 24s
You sit on 24s and we sip on 24s
Got the Caddy sitting on a pair of Gucci penny-loafs
I get money, f**k wit bitches that give me mo'
Man, you know da game, same shit different hoes
We cut the ears and the tail off, Mickey Mouse...
Never been a rat never had em in the house
Call me Captain Kangaroo and I got money in my pouch
And, I dont mean loose change when i say, money in the couch
Im gettin paid thats what I already said
Caint see these niggas, like to breath? on these niggas
Got a bitch named, Nina and Nina so slutty
Cuz she would do him and every one of his buddies

(Hook:)
We put them drinks down and pick them tools up
And if dude trippin we hit dude up
And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up (x2)

We drop the top down and chunk the duece up
These 84s would make a hatta put his shoes up
And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up (x2)

(Verse 2: Trae)
Im in the drop, sittin low, 84s lookin dangerous
My swagga got me in da hood lookin like I was famous
My naked wrist look like it got hit by a couple of paintas
Im gettin money but the fact that im gangsta nevea changes
I goy my Locs on waitin on the time to plex
(?) 06
Its ABN until I rest it won't be nothin less
Yes, Im protected by the neighborhood, I nnever need a vest
I know dem hatas talkin, but they ain't sayin nothin
I hope they stay inside they place ima continue stuntin

My ice tha shit im probably at a hundred stacks, and runnin
I guess Im fly cuz my doors in da air and my trunk is hummin
Im still movin slow, my swagga is jus got off da chain
Whether in the club, way in da hood Im still gon make it rain
Yea, Im tha truth so please address it when you say my name(Trae)
Ya try to take it to me, ima try to take it to ya brain

(Hook:)
We put them drinks down and put them tools up

And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up (x2)

(Verse 3: Trae)
Its still tha same name new dip, new shoes
50 on da frame so I know I won't loose
Sittin so fly doors up when I cruise
All eyes on me everytime a nigga move
I pop another trunk and show the world Im screwed up
They say a different color chain make ya put ya jewels up
Say bitch ya betta chill cuz I beat ya dude up
Put him on da sideline and have his face bruised up, all screwed up
Oh yeah, these diamonds in my mouth show'em I rep tha south
They say a thousand dolla bitch got tha top tuken ova
Up in these streets Im like a kid cuz I love to get lost
And keep packin somethin that love to break a hata off
So when it come to this gangsta homey I got it locked
And if I put tha drop on tha block, Im unable to stop
And when it come to what I do Im tha numba one spot
They know I represent fo Screw and H.A.W.K. bangin my music top
