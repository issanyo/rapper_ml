Verse 1:
I’m so Dipset dips out baby
If you don’t like it nigga fuck you with an AIDS dick
I hope you die thirty times
Nigga murder moms
No fast talk I’m on that syrup I’m on that turtle time
If Killa say the nigga dead then the nigga dead
If Stunna say the nigga dead then the nigga dead
VIP we be them niggas bangin’ in the red
Don’t drink Cristal no more just pour it on white bitches’ heads
This ain't no Tommy Hilfiger this that Polo ho
We are the biggest group alive that get that solo dough
And we gone get that dough until they say there’s no more dough
I smoke an ounce I got that bounce I got that pogo flow
Just shot a video with R Kelly but no homo though
Really didn’t want to do it but I fuck with TS and Fat Joe Joe though
I am a robot and this robot is on overload
And bitch I always will be hot like I’m in overcoats

Chorus

Verse 2:
Dollar after dollar
Holla at your guala
I’m Rolling like the Stones
I need a water bottle
And if you need a pill
T Streets and Carter got em
Supply the whole party
We got the party poppin'
We in New Orleans poppin
We way in harlem poppin
In California poppin
Them Ed Hardy rockin skinny ho’s with all them problems
Bitch you can eat these pills and chill and tell me all about them
Shittt
Hold up my heart is knocking
Don’t worry water stops it
Hold up your mouth is dry
Don’t worry water mops it
I got a great idea
We should have sex
Bitch I’m like Dante Hall
I just throw up the x
My dick be still hard
I be so up for next
That’s when you slip up and fuck around and fuck your ex
That be that bullshit
But it’s the fuckin best
I get her to pop a pill
And come and fuck the set
And I fuckin rep
