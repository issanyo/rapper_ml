[Intro - Turk]
It’s the YNT, YMCMB
We gon’ blame it on the system
Now we gon’ blame it on the system
Nigga, nigga

[Hook - Turk & (Lil Wayne)]
Y’all niggas better zip it, better zip your mouth
Show you what this street shit ’bout
You in doubt? We’ll set fire to your house
And murder everything running out
Y’all niggas better zip it, nigga better zip your mouth
Y’all niggas better zip it, nigga better zip your mouth
Y’all niggas better zip it, better zip your mouth
Show you what this street shit ’bout
You in doubt? We’ll set fire to your house
And murder everything running out
Y’all niggas better zip it, nigga better zip your mouth
Y’all niggas better zip it, nigga better zip your mouth (yeah T)

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
I’m sitting on the foot off the bed, gun by my feet
The dick was too good, the bitch still asleep
Since a pussy got lips, I guess you niggas could speak
You niggas bluffing like snow, you niggas just sleet
Okay I stick to the G code, you stick to the zip code
Money tall like Benjamin Franklin on tip-toes
Your bitch a blowfish, she swallow my fishing pole
I aim at your head, it’s coming off like stripper clothes
I fuck with guerrillas, bust at the Feds
I bet your mouth can’t run if I cut off your legs
I’m fly like a zipper, but that ain’t the point
My bullets fat as a joint, your head crack like a voice
I come to wet up the party, you niggas is garbage
Hollow tips on the cartridge, I let it rip through your cartilage
One number, three letters, 9, AK
Y’all niggas better zip it like YKK
Tunechi

[Hook - Turk & (Lil Wayne)]
Y’all niggas better zip it, better zip your mouth
Show you what this street shit ’bout (yeah)
You in doubt? We’ll set fire to your house
And murder everything running out (I got you T)
Y’all niggas better zip it, nigga better zip your mouth
Y’all niggas better zip it, nigga better zip your mouth (yeah)
Y’all niggas better zip it, better zip your mouth
Show you what this street shit ’bout
You in doubt? We’ll set fire to your house
And murder everything running out
Y’all niggas better zip it (zip it nigga), nigga better zip your mouth
Y’all niggas better zip it (zip it nigga), nigga better zip your mouth (let’s go T)

[Verse 2 - Turk]
Y’all niggas better zip it, zip it, zip it
Buy y’all some four Bentleys, representing real niggas too long
YNT gon’ be there first, y’all niggas thought we was gone?
You gotta be kidding, watch what you say
We catch everything out the air, bare hand no mitten
If my name get mentioned, a nigga gon’ slay you
Catch ya down broad day with your bitch, a nigga still gon’ spray you
What it cost to murk a snitch? Ho, that’s cheap labor
If you survive these 50 shots, you was in God’s favor
Big guns, I’mmma send your mom my condolences
But if she with you when I hit you, you know how us niggas from New Orleans is
Everybody get it, everybody gon’ feel it
Nobody exempt, every charge I got was a murder
In the boot, nigga ain’t no attempts
So I don’t take shots, I’ll send ‘em
Got killers on standby, we’ll take our lawyers ready to defend ‘em
Just having thoughts of snitching, nigga you in violation
So just the thought of your snitching, bitch is annihilation, annihilation

[Hook - Turk & (Lil Wayne)]
Y’all niggas better zip it, better zip your mouth (yeah)
Show you what this street shit ’bout
You in doubt? We’ll set fire to your house
And murder everything running out
Y’all niggas better zip it (zip it nigga), nigga better zip your mouth
Y’all niggas better zip it (zip it nigga), nigga better zip your mouth
Y’all niggas better zip it, better zip your mouth
Show you what this street shit ’bout
You in doubt? We’ll set fire to your house
And murder everything running out
Y’all niggas better zip it, nigga better zip your mouth (uh)
Y’all niggas better zip it, nigga better zip your mouth (zip it nigga)
