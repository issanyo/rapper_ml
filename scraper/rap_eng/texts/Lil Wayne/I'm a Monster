[Verse 2:]
Massacre Music, lose it Loses
Loosen the noose around my neck and turn em blue bitch
Rather go stupid in hollygrove zoo shit
Keep a set of good plies for every pair of loose lips
I lose it I was too sick, I said I'm too two sick
Four sick, five sick, six sense dead people
Just went ahead people, instant
Instinct
I don't care wat color ya is I'll burn ya turn ya skin pink
And if you can't stand me then knock me down
But I don't wanna hear that shit like foxy brown
It's Weezy F people, and I don't talk shit like deaf people
New orleans reFuGee like Wyclef people
My street eagle, and nigga watch your ego
Cause if you think you too fly, den I shoot down that ego
And then the monster see you
And the monster need food
And that monster's me too
So the monster eat you

[Hook: Female]
I've done warned you boy of the monster boy
He's a monster
Feed him rappers or feed him beats and now he's gonna eat... and now he's gonna eat
