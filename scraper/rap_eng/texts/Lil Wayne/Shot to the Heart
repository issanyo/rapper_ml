[Hook]
I've been woundin, I've been waitin for you
Am pretendin, and that's all I can do (it's all I can do mama)
The love am sendin ain't makin it through to your heart (I hope you hear me)

[Lil Wayne]
Pain, since I've lost you I'm lost too
Nigga feelin like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'll do anythin for a part two, art too
Be friends with her, then you come back to me sayin that you forgive me
Gimme another chance I'm needin it like a kidney
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much
But I fucked, I know I fucked up
I admit I fucked up, but everybody fuck up
Now this another nigga locked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
Cause I be from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gansta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster, BANG

[Hook]
You've been brave, never lettin it show
Always tryin to keep it under control (I see you hidin it mama)
You got it now, and weather your way to the top (you doin your thang)
But there's somethin that you forgot

[Lil Wayne]
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everythin, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fight
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star and the sunlight
See take away my title, take away my stripes
You give back my girl then you give me back my life
Give back my girl then you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin she be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap

[Hook]
You've been brave, never lettin it show
Always tryin to keep it under control
You got it now, and weather your way to the top

[Lil Wayne talking over Hook]
You know, I see you hidin it mama
But I know you know
I know you do
But I wish you and yours nothin but happiness shorty

[Lil Wayne]
But I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin room watchin Sportscenter
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver, you know they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings harder than delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma you even went and got a tan drop like me
I remember we was in that home all day
You called me "Butter" I called you "Bay"
My mama asked about ya, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say please don't worry about the women I've been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, DAMN

[Hook]
I've been woundin, I've been waitin for you
Am pretendin, and that's all I can do
The love am sendin ain't makin it through to your heart
