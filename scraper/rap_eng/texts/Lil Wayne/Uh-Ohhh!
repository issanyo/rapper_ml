How I take money, take bi-ih-itches, niggas is
Fascinated with the kid, love my style
Your bitch too'll be on the dick you let her come out
Quit handcuffin' these hoes! My pi-ih-imp game proper
I'm a pis-tal popper, fuck around and get shot up
My niggas all riders, our bitches all done up
Fuck! I know y'all niggas hate to love us; what!

[Hook] with Lil Wayne ad libs

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh-ohh! You did it; now, you gotta get it
Weezy F is in yo' buildin, I will step, on yo' buildin
From the steps, of my buildin, raise hell, hell's risen
Call me young Raekwon, I'm a Chef in Hell's Kitchen
And flow, sweet as devil's food, I eat angels for dinner
Call me what y'all want, I don't give a finger in the middle
I'mma hold it down and blow up, the anchor is the missile
When I say we got them brrrrrrrrrr! I ain't tryin to whistle
Longbody Maybach, it make me feel so little
I'm ballin on the suckers and I won't pick up my dribble
Retarded on the beat—sick!—I spit hospitals
And she couldn't stand under my umbrella if it drizzled
My pimp game proper, my inf' aim proper
So run and I will hit you like Jeremiah Trotter
Yessuh! Call me, young Carter
My leather so soft and I be stunt'n like my dada
Ya dig?!

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Yep yep, I d-d-d-d-dig it!
But our jewelry's so fri-di-di-di-digid, damn
How dare bitches look at Atkins, Carter and Crocker
Like we don't make that crack that get real butter
Did-did-did-did I stu-st-stah-stutter the first time nigga, nah
They like uh-ohhh! Uh uh uh-ohhh! This nigga's tr-uh-ouble
It's the Inc., nigga act like ya know-ow
Who's gettin it, livin this, gangster shit

[Hook]
