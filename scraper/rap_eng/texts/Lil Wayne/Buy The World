[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Mike WiLL; fuck with me!

[Hook: Future]
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na
Tell me—what you think we hustle for?
I just wanna buy the world
Do the impossible
Sing it with me now; na, na, na
What you think we out here workin’ for?
I just wanna buy the world
Do the impossible
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Bought a Benz for my baddest bitch
—and let my niggas drive that motherfucker
I swear that court room can minimize a mothafucka
Pray for us cause we be in and out that mothafucka
Lord, help us Lord, my bitch is beautiful, Helen of Troy
Just like assume I get ass from the start
I flip the script when they cast for the part
You ain’t talking to me if you ain’t talking money my nigga
Strength in numbers, my nigga
And I'm number one like my muscles got bigger
Like my puzzles got figured
I spoil my kids, they so stubborn, my nigga
This is how shit is supposed to be though
Rollie on my wrist and around my neck
I got a chain of command and a food chain on
Shoutout my dog lookin' at the four walls
Shoutout Candace for acceptin' my calls
Impossible ain't impossible at all
Tunechi

[Hook: Future]
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na
Tell me—what you think we hustle for?
I just wanna buy the world
Do the impossible
Sing it with me now; na, na, na
What you think we out here workin’ for?
I just wanna buy the world
Do the impossible
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga do that shit, nigga done that shit
Nigga any problem, bet I overcome that shit
Twenty gold bottles I'ma drink on that shit
Twenty songs that I'm on, number one that shit
My name gon' ring and my team gon' win
I shot a nigga once, and I'd do that shit again
Put your hands on a Bible stealing candy at a store
To a black homicidal it's the same damn sin
Drop down, give me three points ho
K. Dot, give it to it how you want ho
I'ma show you what this West side about
I'ma pull up in a 'Rari at your grandmama's house, hey now
She got a nigga name in her mouth, hey now
T-O to N-O to ammo, I mean
My MO is zero, see commas, I promise
Go tell your mama this dick ain't for free
This dick ain't, this dick ain't
This dick ain't, this dick ain't
This dick ain't for free
Touch that, I need cash back, transaction
I bust back in a all black Grand National
Hoodrats in the project if you ask 'em
They wanna buy the world, 10 racks on they taxes
Holiday cheers, Sallie Mae checks
With a bottle to the neck, get it how you live it

[Hook: Future & Lil Wayne]
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na
Tell me—what you think we hustle for?
I just wanna buy the world
Do the impossible
Sing it with me now; na, na, na
What you think we out here workin’ for?
I just wanna buy the world
Do the impossible
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Kids]
I say hol up (hey!)
I just wanna ball like them grown ups (hey!)
Tell em catch me if they can
I switch gears then switch lanes
You know just what my mind's on these days
Keep singin' with me
I say hol up (hey!)
We just wanna ball like them grown ups (hey!)
Tell em catch me if they can
I switch gears then switch lanes
You know just what my mind's on these days
