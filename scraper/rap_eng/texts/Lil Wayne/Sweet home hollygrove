Hollygrove
Born and raised 
(Chuckles)


Verse 1:
Born and raised with the killer's
I am mad man call me crazy
I am just Misunderstood
Like always, I don't bitch
About it that's just how
Life is , life's a bitch
Death is when ever
I don't worry
When the clock stops
Ticking like a heart beat
I am undefeated
Heavy weighted
Champion where's
My  champion belt
I make her pussy Melt
Like chocolate  then
I lick the chocolate
I am lit af so  shut
The fuck up I tune
Them out,like i gone
Death weezy f baby
(Chuckles)
Tunechi baby
And it's sorry4 the wait 3
