[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Never loved, never loved, never loved another nigga like me
Cause she know I got that good wood
I wham and I bam and I juug juug
She leave out my house on a good foot
I hit her ass up with that Worldstar
I Lollapalooza her good spot
She swallow the kids I say "good God!"
Even though she'll make a good mom
She said she never met a met a good nigga
I said never met a good cop
She suck on that dick like a push pop
She get mad as hell when I pull out
She knows that there's only one Tunechi
She be like Weezy I love Tunechi
I be like baby don't confuse me
Then I play with that pussy like a Rubix
Between me and you she call me sexy chocolate
And I swear that pussy like fudge to me
She say come over and come get it
She said cum on me, cum in me, cum through me
Cause she ain't never been dicked down
She don't know how that feel
She ain't ever been licked down
From her earrings to her heels, Lord
She ain't ever been in a big house
I gotta watch her so she don't steal
She ain't ever been with a millionaire
That's really one in a Mill
Tunechi

[Hook: Jeremih]
She don't know about real niggas, she don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars, she don't what that cost
She don't know about love, she don't know what that is
She don't know about riding round and spending it like this
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Hit the club with a nigga like me
Do drugs with a nigga like me
Fall in love with a nigga like me
And never love another nig, never love another nigga like me
(Meeee, meeee)

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Bitches scream OTF for Lil' Durk

[Verse 3: Lil' Durk]
VV Chanel a nigga like me just can't go ahead and tell
