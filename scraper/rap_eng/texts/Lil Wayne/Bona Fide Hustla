[Verse One : Lil Wayne]
I'm on my grind, fuck bitches money on my mind
Ho get in line, respect me like a stop sign
I'm in my prime, the brights you see it's my time
But fuck my wrists I need that money in my palm
Sellin palm trees, in beaches in shorts sleeves
Fly your beach down here bet ya she won't leave
Exspensive car keys and glasses, t-shirts, pants's
I keep money on me like dancers, Si
Everybody got problems, and money is the answer
The teacher ain't pickin everybody with they hands up
What are we to do but get paid, get ya grass up
Number one fan of the money, join the fan club
These boys don't know paper like I know paper
Nigga I'm still on 2004 paper, I'm tryin to get some more paper
I ain't tryin to die with no paper, that's why a nigga stay....

First Class LV's on the luggage V-8's in the car this the life how you want it
