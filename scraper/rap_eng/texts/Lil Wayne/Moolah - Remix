Keep it strictly business like a suit & tie now
Woah, fly under the radar with my goon, goon, bada
Ain't from Jamaica but we true two shotta, Buju Banton
I got a homie named Gudda, he from the gutter
He keep the cut up, I keep the cutta, we got the cuttas
We in the cut, ready to cut up, who need a cut?
Oozies and pumps, back to the work, ooh we at pump

Only keep real niggas in my circumference
Got my personality rich as a youngin
You know what i did with that nigga i spun

Didn't even miss it, nigga, I'm hustlin'
Nigga, we hustle, pardon the flexin'
Strong armin' niggas and kissin' my muscle, back in the kitchen
