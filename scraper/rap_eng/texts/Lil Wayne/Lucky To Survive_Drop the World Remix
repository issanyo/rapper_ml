Verse 1(Arturo Flowz)
You know that boarding school is another form of prison
Created by the racist elitist politicians
In racist New England, they force Assimilation
Racist hockey fuck boys enable discrimination
Fuck Massachusetts, they act like they’re nice
I was  sexually assaulted not once but twice
Fuck James Jarvis and Taiga Murata
Fuck Eric Haneda, we Left Coast choppers
Fuck Cushing Academy, the whole administration
They’re a bunch of Nazis like birth of a nation
The cisnormativity enables intersectionality
The whole fucking school is a logical fallacy
Hook(LilWayne)
I'm going to pick the world up and drop it on your fucking head
I'm going to pick the world up and I'm going to drop it on your fucking head
If I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker
I'm gone
Mother fucker I'm gone

Verse 2 Arturo Flowz
Sexually assaulted with a tennis racket
Called me animal killer for the ruff on my jacket
Fuck you  imperialists, better keep your trapped zipped
The wolf is real, the Yup’ik people trapped it
A Left Coast progressive, I will never assimilate
Fuck the boarding schools and the trauma they create
And people ask me why the fuck I’m mad
You didn’t know the upbringing that I had

Hook(LilWayne)
I'm going to pick the world up and drop it on your fucking head
I'm going to pick the world up and I'm going to drop it on your fucking head
If I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker
I'm gone
Mother fucker I'm gone

Verse 3(Arturo Flowz)
My dad was an asshole called me a fucking slob
Never at home, always on the job
My mom’s eldest nephew locked me in a bathroom
People tried to silence me inside the classroom
They said that I have the boarding school syndrome
I looked on the website and I have those symptoms
Fuck my parents, and my auntie, you know that i’m done with you
Fuck all who were silent, each and everyone one of you
It seems that a lot of my family was deceived
I can’t stay in Alaska, you know I must leave
You elitist motherfuckers, I’m happy I survived
I thank nature’s spirits, lucky to be alive
You neolib motherfuckers enable persuction
Shut down the boarding school, that is my solution
This is  for my survivors, I know you feel the same
The rich and the bougie, the the ones to blame
The boarding school is a prison, minus the chains
Where they lcok you in a cell and disect your brain
That's why I hate neolibs, I thought I could trust you
But you let me down, so I say  fuck you

Hook(LilWayne)
I'm going to pick the world up and drop it on your fucking head
I'm going to pick the world up and I'm going to drop it on your fucking head
If I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker
I'm gone
Mother fucker I'm gone
