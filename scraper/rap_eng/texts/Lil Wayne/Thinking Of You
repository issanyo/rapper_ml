[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
And mommy used to tell me one day some girl gone get me
But I won't know love if it walk right up and hit me
And if I fall to the ground I get up and fight another round
And I got money on my mind, money on my mind, but now

[Hook]
I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
Girl, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
Girl, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
And we ain't even gotta go far, we ain't gotta talk about the war, we can just (Get it (7x)
I said we ain't even gotta go far, we ain't gotta talk about the war, we can just (Get it (7x)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Damn I'm just thinking home 3 winner
Chirping late night, she had the light up antenna
Voices far from ?
13 speaking like we 23 sometimes I would even miss dinner
Cause talking with you felt more important than Jordan's release when the 17's, remember
I get em, similar to any girl I've mentioned
They only thought I'd mention I'm only playing with your intuition
Your senses sensed that I was different
But too flashy for boyfriend material
But I beg to differ
And this is it I'm showing you more material
Now listen, let's Kiss, like Gene Simmons
I've got a vision, fuck a title
We the perfect image, you and I
No eyein' them, them girls, you be eyein' them, cause they be eyein' him
They water stronger than vitamins
Loving you to death, I didn't expect
Beautiful girls, make you suicidal
I guess I'm dyin' then..

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Up jump the boogie, and shorty said she feeling my flavor
And even when I ain't looking, I got her on my radar
And yes I know man I am so, so blessed to have her
So yesterday, today, and the day after; I keep thinking of you
I keep thinking of you

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Shorty said she feeling my swag
Shorty said she feeling my style
I keep thinking about her
About you, about you

I keep, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl
I keep, I keep, thinking of you I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl
I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you
All the things I could do, I could do them to you
And I'm thinking of you, thinking of you

Young Moulah baby
I spilled my drink
Change your drawers baby
Will somebody please please double-cup me
