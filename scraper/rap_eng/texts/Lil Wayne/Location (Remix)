[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Remix, baby, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Meet you at the spot, send the location
I don't do this a lot, special occasion
I know you ain't a thottie, you ain't no basic
I turn your dry spot to an oasis
I kiss the right spots, I know all the places
Oh I lick the right spots, that's an ultimatum
The loud in rotation, cloud 9, flotation
Let the rose petals spread like rosacea
I know your ex to blame for your cold nature
Tell him stay in his lane, stop the road ragin'
And now I got you in here makin' those faces
Runnin' 'round the bedroom like four bases, moolah!

[Chorus: Khalid]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
(place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Verse 2: Khalid]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh
So won't you

[Chorus: Khalid]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Verse 3: Kehlani]
Drop me a pin, let's fall
Way deeper into whatever we're callin' it
Whatever we're fallin' into
'Cause I don't really care about rules
I don't really care about rules
I just really care about you
I'm enjoyin' starin' into
Your eyes when I'm all in it with you
They can choose to watch, but I'd rather they just listen
Could fill up an album with everything that they're missin'
They so superficial, don't understand how we're chillin'
We don't need a lot, we got us and that's why we're winnin'
To them it's a park bench, us a magic carpet
Little trips to Target turn to avant garde shit
I promise, we got this, we got this
Baby just send me your

[Chorus: Khalid & Kehlani]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else, but you

[Outro: Khalid, Kehlani & Lil Wayne]
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
Ride, ride
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
Ride, ride.... tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
But you, but you
Nothing else but you
But you
(Remix, baby)
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but you
