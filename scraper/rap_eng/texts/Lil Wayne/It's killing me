[Hook]
It's killin me
Wooooo
I must like it when you question me about it baby
I swear, but they say, it's just not true

[Overlapping first Hook]
Woo, yeah
How ya'll doin out there?
I'd just like to tell ya'll my story
Ya dig?
That's right
Everybody in the crowd put your tree'z up
Yeah, put your tree'z up
Let's go
Yeah

[Verse 1]
3 in the mornin, I ain't home yet
Shawty blowin up my phone like a bomb threat
What's goin on baby?
Why you on that?
Knowin when I make it home I get ya thong wet
Okay I'm on my way, speedin windows up
So have my food warm, and have my pillows fluff
She been through the water, shawty guerilla tough
Shawty take all them shots like the Louis cup
I wanna give her all, and never give her up
I told her when it died down we could live it up
Where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm like
As soon as I come home, I was workin long
She wanna know what I was working on
So I play her this song
And I make her feel wrong
But still in all in my eyesight, she passed right
I can't trip cuz no one loves the fast life
Or sittin in the passenger seat, hold tight
When she gives a whole platter to me, her whole life
But for me that's too much to eat, in one bite but
I'mma chew and just do what I gotta
Other bitches get the boot like a high top Prada
Where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Can I talk to her, yeah, um
Leave the drama on daytime television
What is this detention?
It feel like elementary
I wish I never injure
Hurt or scar you
When I think of my future
Baby that are you
I mean that is you
Part of my fears
You know, part of my mental
See what I'm into?
See how I'm in too deep in the shit too?
It ain't just you, it is us two
I trust you, you gotta trust me
Cuz in them other bitches eyes I'm a must-see
Now where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me girl

It's killin me
Wooooo
I must like it when you question me about it baby
I swear, but they say, it's just not true
