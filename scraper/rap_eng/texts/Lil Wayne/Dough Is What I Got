[Intro]
This is a public service announcement
Lil Wayne, Weezy F. Baby, is the best rapper alive
Hit me
Good morning, New York
Good afternoon, New Orleans
Good night, America
Yeah

[Hook]
Dough is what I got, lil mama
Dough is what I got, pretty lady
Dough is what I got, shawty
Dough is what I got, baby
C'mon, I'm paid, I'm paid
I'm paid, I'm paid, hey!

[Verse 1]
Give a woman none, uh-uh
I already gave my brother some, it's my sister turn
Ain't it funny how the fish do bird
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm
As the world in the barrel of the pistol turn
And we get it how we live, never lived and learned
Gotta talk about the flow 'cause you is concerned
Only down-south rapper could've been in The Firm
Or The Commission or a Wu-Tang nigga
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang, nigga
Got that Sub-Zero flow, how you owe me mine
Nigga "Get over here" like Scorpion
And when it comes down to this recording
I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan
No, I won rings with my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist
Same coach, same game, been starting
Same Triangle Offense
I come through the lane like a Dodge, and
Referee niggas is lame, they call charging
I have no brain, I'm retarded
We are not the same, I'm a Martian
You can be my Jane, I'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or late September, whatever you call it
I hit niggas in the head like Vonage
I am talking to no particular audience
But understand, I'm the guardian
And understand there won't be no guarding him
You will just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's bossy
I keep pussy running like a faucet
She better catch like she Steve Largent
Because I'm "What's up!?" like Martin

[Interlude]
Hahaha, woo! Yeah
See, I know y'all talking about me
And you don't like what you hear sometimes
But umm, since I'm so bright
I'mma put the spotlight on you baby

[Hook]
Show me what you 'bout, lil daddy
I know you need to stop, stop hatin'
I know what you not, whoadie
And that is Weezy Baby
Blunts up, now blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze
Work it

[Verse 2]
Tell the world "Take six"
Young Dictionary, make words make sense
Then, I make cents make dollars
Make the skinny girl holla, make the fat girl hungry
Make the ugly girls want me, put the pretty girls on me
Make the shy girls horny, make the fly girls corny
And only for me, because of who I A-M, holla back in the morning
Hey! Now holla back if you own shit, the CEO of the moment
Bullshit â€“ I don't condone it
Aw baby, just hop on it

[Interlude]
Haha, yeah
You like that... I know!
Marley, what up? Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Hook]
Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shawty
Show me what you got, baby
You rappers ain't safe, safe, safe, safe, ah!
