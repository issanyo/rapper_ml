[Intro]
Yeah
(Money on my mind) That's right
(So money is all I think of) That's right
(Money on my mind) Bitch, you know
(So money is all I think of) Bitch, bitch, ayy

[Verse 1]
Stepping out the motherfucking car, they in awe
I'm looking like a star, bitch, when you see me make a wish
Holla at your motherfucking boy, J-R
Birdman my pa, bitch, ball bred, born rich (yeah)
Dear Mr. Toilet, I'm the shit
Got these other haters pissed, 'cause my toilet paper thick
I know, but trip and that .40 make a chip
Out a potato-head wimp, then, like ranch, I dip (gone)
And the hustle is all muscle, just strength
When it comes to that weight I don't struggle, I just lift (one-two)
I got my hand on the game, yeah I make a grip
Hundred grand in my fist, same on my wrist
Get ki money from a quarter, blame it on my wrist
I whip coke like hoes, nigga, I'm a pimp
Lil nigga 'bout to rape the market
If we talking 'bout money, baby, now we talking

[Chorus]
Yeah, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Get money, get money, get money
Get money, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 2]
Nigga, get it in a slump, if you know how
In the heart of the summer, we need a snow plow
What you know about that? Baby, it's your time
Coke transactions on the phone, we call it "blow jobs"
Too fast for the feds, too cocky for the cops
Had to ditch my old bitch, getting sloppy with the pots (bitch!)
Hopping off the boat, meeting Papi at the docks
He tell me I'm gaining weight, I tell him I'm getting paid
Money Over Bitches, I'm yelling it to the grave
Developed at a young age, go after what pays
These Gabbana sunshades block the sun rays
I drop a car note in the mall on the first date
I gotta get it even if it's in the worst way
That cake, like it's-it's my birthday
New Orleans my birthplace, ya heard me?
Where money's more important than a person

[Chorus]
Yeah, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Get money, get money, get money
Get money, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 3]
Twisting up a blunt, thinking 'bout my next dollar
I'm digging in the game tryna get some money out her
I'm so vain it's a problem
There ain't a stain on these Pradas, I'm just being modest
Got me a goddess, show her how to divide it
She still down and she don't get none of the profit
Wheel around the city, let the tints hide me
"That's a cold motherfucker, whoever inside it"
Forever symbolizing the grind, it don't walk to you
I make it run like horses do
Giddy-up, baby, if he got it, then hit him up, baby
I know it's crazy, but I can't get enough, baby
I love it, I fucking love it
I'm a self-made millionaire, fuck the public
Riding to myself, 'cause I don't fuck with nothing
Pistol on my lap on the way to the money!

[Chorus]
Yeah, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Get money, get money, get money
Get money, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
