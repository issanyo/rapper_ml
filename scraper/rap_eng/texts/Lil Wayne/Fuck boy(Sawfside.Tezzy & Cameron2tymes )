[HOOK:]
It's amazing to me homie
That nigga's you fuck wit dawg
You don't know the truth about these niggas
Till ya'll fall out. The more you show a nigga
The more dangerous he become to you homie

[Verse 1 :MannMann]
I broke bread wit chu nigga showed you how I live
You talkin nigga but you don’t understand
What real is
When it came to you pussy ass nigga
I would of killed but it was my fault nigga I kept it too real

We busted choppers at nigga’s laid in bushes together
You had me fooled dawg I thought u was my fucking nigga
Would of did a 100 years for ya cause I fucks wit cha
You told me what a good heart in these streets would get a nigga
Not a muthafuckin thing but a sad picture
Hurt me when I found out you had pussy in ya heart nigga
I never thought I would say this but mutha fuck a friend
Cuz ya dawg be the one that cross you in the end
The shit I know now wish I had knew it back then
But going through it wit a fuck nigga is what make a man
I treat ya pussy ass better than I did my own kin
When a nigga locked up or broke that’s when they claim they love you then

[Verse 2: lil wayne]
What was mine was yours but what was yours wasn’t mine
If a nigga would of told me you was flow I would of thought he was lying
But every nigga gonna show his hand in due time
I kept it so muthafuckin real wit chu that I was blind
Cuz I was to busy showing love I ain’t see the signs
When you needed me pussy I came through every time
Whether u was right or wrong fuck nigga I was riding
But u envied me nigga in the back of yo mind
You wasn’t a hunter nigga you was real part time
I broke you off nigga when them fuck nigga’s wouldn’t give you a dime
I ain’t owe you shit I just wanted to see you shine
You never gave me shit I had my own grind and I ain’t need yo choppers nigga I had my own nine
Im a hunter nigga I done did me and yo time
You can't trust ya own homies who the fuck can you trust
I got more pride in my chopper so to me that’s enough

[Verse 3: MannMann]
And God ain’t making you fuck nigga’s like he used to
A nigga I’ll believe his hoe now before he believe you
And cuz u thug wit a nigga don’t mean the love true
It use to matter what you and yo nigga’s done been through
Nigga can be ya dawg one day and turn pussy out the blue
A fuck nigga gone do what a fuck nigga gone do
Better off running by yo self if you only knew
Don’t mean that nigga a hunter cuz he’ll fucking shot
And money don’t mean he real cuz he got loot
If a nigga heart ain’t right no telling what he’ll do
And real nigga’s extinct it’s only a fucking few
Cause 99% of these fuck nigga’s ain’t true

[HOOK:]
It's amazing to me homie
That nigga's you fuck wit dawg
You don't know the truth about these niggas
Till yall fall out. The more you show a nigga
The more dangerous he become to you homie

[Verse 4: MannMann]
Aye my nigga I want to thank all the pussy ass nigga’s who I thought was real my nigga’s
Nigga’s who I though was my muthafuckin homeboy’s nigga
I salute you pussy as nigga’s homie
Cuz if it wasn’t for you fuck nigga’s my nigga
I still be showing love right now dawg
I still be walking through this muthafuckin blind my nigga
But it’s something that yall nigga’s taught me my nigga that
Its ya homies my nigga
That try you the muthafuckin most my nigga
Dem the nigga’s you can’t let hold something dawg
And they feel like they ain’t never got to give it back
Cause they ya muthafuckin dawg
Dem the nigga’s who can be tied down and locked up my nigga
And you can take care of dem nigga’s for two three years my nigga
As soon as dem nigga’s get out dawg they go fuck wit the nigga’s
Who ain’t never gave em nothing my nigga
Go run back to the same hoe who ain't never did nothing for em while they was locked up homie
I thank you nigga’s and salute you nigga’s my nigga
And wit all that said my nigga
I wanna tell you one thing for I go homie
God Bless You Pussy Ass Niggas
