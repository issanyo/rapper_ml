"Hey Foxx, we just living our life right?"

"Weezy, Just Blaze"
Now everybody let's get...

Let me introduce myself they call me Mr. Foxx
Known for making ladies scream and jumpin' out the socks
Yes it's all real (real) I'm king of the hill (hill)
Call Carl Davis pack them up and ship another mil
Told ya last time but I swear y'all must not understand me
Girl come home with me and let me introduce you to my Grammy family like Encore Oscar and Emmy
Accolades I got many (many) got that kinda gwop you gotta wheel in with a semi baby

Get your friends inside with me
Common girl just ride with me
Plenty of girls that wish they could be standing on the side of me
I can see the look up in your eyes
But the looking at your thighs, lips, and hips make a nigga naturize
Babe if cash rules than my click, we rising to the top
On a highway robbery, we doing 90 in the drop
Lets go hit the strip baby
Then go home and strip baby
Bounce it like them drums on this blaze shit baby
Girl just say the word can we can break out like the pox
But you got 4 seconds for I'm right up out the spot like

[Chorus:]
4 and 3 and 2 and 1 [Repeat: x2]
Cause you know I'm number one
Girl you know I'm number one
Baby you know I'm number one
That's right I said I'm number
Now everybody lets get...

Everybody know the name they call me Mr. Foxx
Swagger on a billie got the stunting game on lock
Got them hundred dollar bills

Glory or dollywood whatever I don't need to know your name
Yup girl shake it for me
Yep girl take it for me
My private jet it be waiting
You can bring a friend and hey
See the diamonds on me
They be shining like a star
I see how you watching me posted up at the bar
We can leave the club and git it right
We can do it all night long have you singing
Baby this my song, it's a number one performer
You gotta be my supporter whatever you want
You know I can get it for you (yup)
This goes out to all you haters yeah whoever doubt me
I'm a boss, I'm a player, got nothing to say about me
Lets go hit the strip baby then go home and strip baby
Bounce it like them drums on this blaze shit baby
Girl just say the work we can break out like the pox
But you got 4 more seconds before I break up out the spot like

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
They call me Mr. Carter I fly over water
In my own charter, baby I can turn you on like a phone charger
Baby I can hit it like a motherfucking dodger
If you want a soldier baby I can be your soldier
And girl if your gay umm I can be your Marvin
I like hot grits and toast in the morning
I hope you turn into a ghost in the morning
I pop you up like chicken pox
Shout out to my nigga Jamie Foxx
We tighter than some sticky socks
I be in slickest drop
Listening to some Iggy Pop
And I'm from the dirty I say fuck the broom and a mop
He's so sweet make her wanna eat the candy store
1, 2, 3, 4 like
Lets go hit the strip baby then go home and strip baby
Foxx and Lil' Wayne on this blaze shit baby
Girl just say the word n we can break out like the pox
Plus you got 4 minutes for I'm right up out the spot

[Chorus]
