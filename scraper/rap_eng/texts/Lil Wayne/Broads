[Verse 1 - Manny Fresh]
See these broads, I like em and shit
Wish I could give all these hoes a picture-of-my dick
See I like em and psyche em, then I get in the win
I might just need you and leave you at a quarter past ten, but
I ain't gonna lie, your pussy was good
But your mouth is better so I wish you would
Work your way down to the diznick
It feels so good when you do the liznick
You got me doing push-ups and I'm taking ginseng
(Let's get ready to rumble!) In the middle of the ring
You got my dick hard like a '57 Chevy
Rocked up, ya cocked up, cause I'm ready
To go up in ya, let that other nigga send ya
Cards and shit while you suckin my dick
I like you a little bit more than I'm diggin my shirt
Ya little pretty ass dick suckin expert, beeyoch!

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
See I love these broads but I toss em up quick
Every trick that I get, they get flipped through the clique

[Verse 2 - Birdman]
These broads, nigga, I wish that I could love em all
These broads, nigga, I wish that I could fuck em all
These broads, I let these hoes just drive my car
But these hoes know one thing: that I'm a superstar
These hoes get out of line, I'mma show 'em I'm a hog
And now that I'm rich, I show these hoes that they ain't shit
And every ho I fuck with, I make suck my dick
It ain't no secret, I know these hoes about my money, shit
But I tell a ho quick, that she ain't shit
My main ho Clare, I don't make her suck my dick
I might just get loose and wanna kiss my bitch
But now that I got a daughter, I'm supposed to be light on a bitch
But I'm gonne be hard on these hoes for life, shit
I'm a true U-P-T player for life, shit
But I'mma say it again, I don't love no bitches
I about my money, nigga, and fucking these bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Birdman]
Now I dunn been here for 25 years
I understand one thing: that life is a bitch
I dunn lost my ma and my pa, my brother and my sister all up in one year
I understand one thing, I gotta ball til I fall
And show these hoes that money ain't no thang, dawg
See, I tell a bitch that she ain't shit
And at the same time ask that ho to suck my dick
See, I don't take money and mix with no bitch
Cause one thing, these hoes would lose they mind and get lost quick
It ain't no secret, I make these hoes think I'll pay their shit
But I keep it real and I pay my nigga's shit
I say, "fuck a ho," and make these hoes back up
I keep it real and fuck with niggas who'll act up
And kick in your front door, your ho told my nigga where your dope
Now you stuck out like a ho!
And my niggas dunn hit a lick from your bitch
And all you hoes mad cause we dunn hit your shit

[Hook]
