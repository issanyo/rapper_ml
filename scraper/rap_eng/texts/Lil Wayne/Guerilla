YEAA!

[Hook]

On the real-a
I'm a Guerilla
Now have you ever heard of a nigga like me
I'm a G-O-Rilla
On the real
Don't get wit me
That's on the real
And don't slip on a banana peel
Because you will get killed

BY THE GUERILLA
I'm a Guerilla
BY THE GUERILLA
I'm a Guerilla
BY THE GUERILLA
I'm a guerilla-aa-a-a-a-aa-a-a-aaaaaaaaa

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

Boy you don't want me bullshit
Slip on a banana
You just such a panza
Shootin like Bonanza
Dirty like the hamper
Boy you are not a man, You are just Amanda
I bet that choppa bring 'em all proper ganda
Come on world bear wit me like a panda
I run this shit
Like a hurry up hike to Randel
From the scrimage line I burn them like a candle
TOUCHDOWN!
Up town Up town
Hollygrove, U.S.A
Money long like a New Orleans flight to L.A
Fuck boy I rep New Orleans like everyday
Everynight
Ballin like
Reverend Knight
Every Night
Everyday
24/7-8-9-10
I'm in the jungle
And I'm comin to yo front door
Knock, Knock - Who's There - Long Hair, Don't care

YEAA!

[Verse 2: Nutt The Kid]

Put some bass in yo voice
So I can knock the amp out you
Get amped
And I'll make an amp out you
Put you in the trunk wit the bubbly
In the jungle
Missin for months
Til they forget about you
Find you
Can't identify you
I'm a rider
Guerillas will spank yo mama
The Dr. that brought you out her
I done went bananas over my clam chowder
Banana clips in the choppas
And we clap 'em like "Bravo"
Scream like the opera
So I can give you an encore
Civil back guerilla
And I got the medal of honor
Poppin the metal feranaz
At who?- Metal & Tiana
Who the fuck seen it
Who? What? When? & How?
Cuz, I'll slit your neck from ear to ear
Like the black Dalia
The flow well radical
Lil nigga wit an attitude
Like "Blaw"
Launch you in the altitude
What's your latitude
Residue under my nails
All about my revenue
Who ever knew
They say I Blow
Like Blue Hill Avenue

YEAA!
