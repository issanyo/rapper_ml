I Love a girl in a whole nother language
People look at us strange
Don't understand us
They try to change it
I try to tell her don't change
We talk loud and they say it sounds crazy
Love's even more wild when you're angry

Don't understand why you wanna change it
Girl listen to me!
You're just running from the truth
But I'm scared of losing you
You are worth to much to lose
Baby if you're still confused

Girl I'm just in love with you
Girl I'm just in love with you
No other words to use
I'm just in love with you
I'm just in love with you

When I tell you "I would never leave you"
Do you hear what I say?
Don't understand you, you say you need time
But you've been calling all day
Talk love and they say it sounds crazy

Love's even more wild when you're angry
I don't understand why you wanna change it

Girl listen to me!
You're just running from the truth
And I'm scared of losing you
You are worth to much to lose
Oh baby! If you're still confused

Girl I'm just in love with you
(Do you hear what I say?)
That I'm just in love with you
(Can nobody change it?)
No other words to use
(I love you baby!)
I'm just in love with you
I'm just in love with you
I'm just in love with you

Ohhh....
Never knew what we have
They don't understand
That is just a waste of time
We know this is real
I know how you feel
When you put your hand in mine

Girl I'm just in love with you
Girl I'm just in love with you
No other words to use
I'm just in love with you
(Let me say it again. (x2))
I'm just in love with you
(Just in love (x2))
I'm Just In Love With You
