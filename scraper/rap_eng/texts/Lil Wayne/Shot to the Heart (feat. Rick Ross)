(Chorus)
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
(That's all I can do mama) the love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart...
(I hope you hear me)

(Lil Wayne)
Since I've lost you I'm lost too
Nigga feeling like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you in your heart too
God knows that I'll do anything for a part 2
Ought to, be praying for the day you come back to me
Sayin that you forgive me
Give me another chance I'm needing it like a kidney
I don't want an advance
Give me back her hands give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up, but everybody fucks up
Now this southern nigga locked up
Telling me and my click don't give a fuck
Cause I'm from new Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was a soldier
I was a gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster, bang!

(Hook) (Lil Wayne talking)
You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show
Always Trying, To Keep It Under Control (I see you hiding it mama)
You Got It Down, And You're Well On Your Way To The Top (You doin' your thing)
But There Is Something You Forgot

(Hook) (Lil Wayne talking)
You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show
Always Trying (I see you hiding it mama)
To Keep It Under Control (But I know you know)
You Got It Down (I know you do)
And You're Well On Your Way To The Top (But I wish you nothin' but happiness)
But There Is Something You Forgot

(Lil Wayne)
But I hope u haven't forgot about me
Up in the living room watchin sports center
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the lord is a forgiver
You know they say if u pray then u can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Why you even go and get a like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me butter, I called you babe
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say, please, don't worry about the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen

And all I can do is dream. Damn

(Hook)
I've Been Lonely
I've Been Waiting For You
I'm Pretending, and That's All I Can Do
The Love I'm Sending Ain't Making It Through To Your Heart

(Rick Ross)
I shed tears 'cause I'm told that they'll heal
To tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Ever felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave 'em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin
Way back it was hoops, now it's Maybach coupes
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room
I'm laughin, cause it's lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattood by kartoo?
(somebody switch) by my rules we all lose

(Lil Wayne)
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fight
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, you would cry twice
To me you were the brightest star under sunlight
Take away my title, take away my stripes
And give me back my girl and you give me back my life
-Give me back my girl and you give me back my life-
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hoping she'd be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I could bring it back
What she means to me is what I mean to rap

(Rick Ross)
Flippin through magazines, ridiculed for my life
But they keep takin pictures of my jewels in the light
Hundred g's in the night, entertain big timers
Cause my 1 liners rule these dynamers
Smellin rosé on my breath, on ex brisco fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin lavish stackin mail up
Clothes come from big n tall …………?
Got live life, I'm tryna live life
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the Benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars

(Hook) (Lil Wayne talking)
You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show

(Rick Ross)
Fortune n fame are pleasures you couldn't fathom
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin 'em mighty daily
I know I'm under surveillance ( I look at it as a talent)
Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin I'm such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)
I started without a coin, not knowin which way I'm goin
Now I'm chatering boeings n readin a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
And I never felt this way about anything in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success

(Hook)
I've Been Lonely
I've Been Waiting For You
I'm Pretending, And Thats All I Can Do
The Love I'm Sending Ain't Making It Through To Your Heart
