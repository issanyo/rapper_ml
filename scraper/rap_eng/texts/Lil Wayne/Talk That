[Hook - T-Pain]
And I'mma talk, talk, talk, talk
And I'mma talk, talk, talk, talk
Now go and give me 50 because when I talk I spit and
If the haters keep hating, I'mma have to come and talk that shit

[Verse - Lil Wayne]
Happy ass Weezy, never in a bad mood
Boy I talk shit like I swallowed a bathroom
Girl give me vacuum, do it 'til her lips drool
The ice in your fridge never met a nigga this cool
Young money I’m richer than I used to be
I plant my seed in her garden now she root for me
Baby I’ma tell you truthfully:
I talk it and I do believe I walk it
Call me orthopedic Carter and I ought to be an author
Damn, man and I tell ya, it’d be a best seller
Tim on the beat and me Missy Elliot goes wherever
Ya dig?
You can ask the bank teller
But my money old like Nelson Mandela
Higher than a propeller
And baby I can show you better than acapella

[Hook]
