Make your rules
Yes sir, 3, ha, I love this shit
So let me talk my shit
Okay I'm good

I know you see the drop 'cause gettin' money is what we on
Ridin' drop top in the winter with the heat on
Bad yella bitch, keep my passenger seat warm
Leg hangin' out the window, you ain't got these on

Bitch holla it is Lil' Weezy, they cannot see me
They are like Stevie, I am burin' a ton like Levie
I circle ya house like B.B, colder then the Hebbie Gebbies
Never give freebies, seventy five thousand for these fees

Shit I can get a hundred thousand up in these jeans
Big stacks my pockets on Creatine
Young Money, Dipset nigga we a team
If you don't like it nigga fuck you, no Vaseline

I peel off in the Lamborghini like a tangerine
Got the engine straight shakin' like a tambourine
Like a bitch with some lips like Angeline, not Joli
Holy, got flow, I go where no other guy go

Fuck you hoe I'm so 504
I hope every snitch die slow
Hip hop that's my hoe, I know she know
I like it wet don't won't no dry hoe

Alright bitch I am D-Boy, no decoy
And I will straight up destroy any boy or man
And I prefer money then bitches or just reefer
We are Young Money bitch and I am the leader

We are Currency, Mack Maine and D-Raw
And I just signed a chick named Nikki Menage
And me I'm still spittin' like a retard
And these niggas soft they should be rappin' in leotards

Nigga we in charge, baby put me in charge
And I'm just murderin' niggas free of charge
You dig, just holla back I see you sarge
I'm so motherfuckin' high I can eat a star

Yeah let me upgrade ya, you may not be a model
But I can front page ya
You know I'm nasty, excuse my behavior
Let me just taste ya, we can fuck later

Sittin' in the Coupe lookin' like a racer
Top peeled back like the skin of a potato
Seat way back listenin' to Anita Baker
Ridin' by myself, smokin' weed by the acre

Holly Grove gator, ain't nobody greater
Leave you with some bullet holes, the size of craters
You ain't heard the latest, Weezy F. the greatest
Battle anybody nigga fuck over ya favorite

It's a new game and I'm the coach like Avery
Leave it to the flow, we gettin' dough like a bakery
I don't really want to but these niggas makin' me
Put a motherfucker on ice like the Maple Leaves

That's a hockey team and I ain't on no hockey team
But I'm a champion, where's the fuckin' Rocky theme?
Damn, rest in peace Apollo Creed
I'm a monster everyday is Halloween

A lot of syrup, a lot of pills and a lot of weed
And I keep my pockets green like a pot of peas
And if you hatin baby you can get a side of these
These nuts in your mouth and can you swallow please?

Yeah, I'm so hot I freeze
Big balls and they jangle like a lotta keys
Even deaf bitches say hi to me
She tell a blind bitch and she say I gotta see
