Murder

[Verse 1:]
I be the one with the women by the dozen
I get em all; sister, friend, or cousin
I never thought I'd be the one to fall in love
Then she came along (She came along)
She had it all, beauty of an actress
Plus she was smart, help me do my taxes
She'd give my lovin' incredibly with the passion
I can't explain, I can't refrain
Tears is fallin', never thought I'd see the day
Friends is callin' askin, "Homie, are you okay? "
She told me her love was mine
And then she gave what's mines away

[Chorus:]
And it was like click clack bang bang
I got shot
Never should've got caught slippin' with this girl
When the pretty girls shoot
They gon' aim for your heart
Murder she wrote
And it was like
(Murder she wrote)
She hit me in the heart
(Murder she wrote)
And it was like
(Murder)
She hit me in the heart
(Murder she wrote)
Murder, murder, murder
She hit me in the heart
Murder, murder, murder
She hit me in the heart
Murder
She hit me in the heart
Murder she wrote

[Verse 2:]
Thought we was good, cooked me breakfast in the morning
She kept it hood, never trippin' on them shawty's
She get it poppin' whenever just how I want it
She did it all
We had a ball
Tears is fallin' 'cause I miss her everyday
Friends is callin' askin, "Homie, you okay? "
She told me her love was mine
And then she gave what's mines away

[Chorus:]
And it was like click clack bang bang
I got shot
Never should've got caught slippin' with this girl
When the pretty girls shoot
They gon' aim for your heart
Murder she wrote
And it was like
(Murder she wrote)
She hit me in the heart
(Murder she wrote)
And it was like

(Murder)
She hit me in the heart
(Murder she wrote)
Murder, murder, murder
She hit me in the heart
Murder, murder, murder
She hit me in the heart
Murder
She hit me in the heart
Murder she wrote

[Bridge:]
So sweet and innocent
I never saw it coming
A permanent hole inside my heart
I wish I could've seen this from the start
Learned my lesson the harder way
Never gon' be the same again
Murder in the first degree
The minute she took one look at me
Ohhh

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
There's a killer in the room
In a black dress
In a pair of red pumps
That'll shoot cha in ya chest but
I got on a vest
Cause I been hit befo'
But shawty like a sniper with a rifle with a scope
But shawty tryn'a shoot me in the head this time
Shawty tryn'a kill my body soul an mind
Should'a had the wedding an the wake at the same time
I tell a girl I love her N' this how she respond

[Chorus:]
Click clack bang bang
I got shot
Never should've got caught slippin' with this girl
When the pretty girls shoot
They gon' aim for your heart
Murder she wrote
And it was like
(Murder she wrote)
She hit me in the heart
(Murder she wrote)
And it was like
(Murder)
She hit me in the heart
(Murder she wrote)
Murder, murder, murder
She hit me in the heart
Murder, murder, murder
She hit me in the heart
Murder
