Go, I'm in love with a beauty, she is a cutie
Somebody say they saw us kissin' in da movies
We had a drink or two, we saw Rush Hour Two
Then we went home and we made our own movie

Lights, camera, action, you dig
Lights, camera, action, you dig
It's showtime, it's showtime
Show me yours, show you mine

Like, ooh, ooh, ooh, it's goin' down in this bitch
Like a boxer in the first round in this bitch
1-800, I would dicky down in this bitch
Uptown in this bitch, don't make a sound in dis, shh

Now let me whisper in yo' ear
Every single word your little ear wanna hear
Flip yo' body over, have no fear
Can I put my tongue here until you tear?

Cry, baby, cry, baby, suck yo' momma titty
You know I like dem old, I might have yo' momma with me
I like your girlfriend and your girlfriendses
Honor my pole like a flag on the end, bitch

Lights, camera, action, you dig
Lights, camera, action, you dig
It's showtime, it's showtime
Show me yours, show you mine

Lights, camera, action, you dig
Lights, camera, action, you dig
It's showtime, it's showtime
Show me yours, show you mine

Oh shawty, hold on, can I holla atcha?
Oh shit, she ain't impressed, she know I was a rapper
See, I'm the illest motherfucker that could spit forever
Goddamn, that pussy tight than Tiger Woods' sweater

See my sex is greater 'cause my dick is bigger
I got that cum that you could drink like a 20 liter
So let me come and teach you, I know you want it deeper
I put some money on that ho like she was a Visa

She catch my balls in her mouth like a wide receiver
She set it off on my dick, I call her Queen Latifah
She gave you blow on the low like a bag of reefer
She's a hood diva, so you know it's

Lights, camera, action, you dig
Lights, camera, action, you dig
It's showtime, it's showtime
Show me yours, show you mine

Lights, camera, action, you dig
Lights, camera, action, you dig
It's showtime, it's showtime
Show me yours, show you mine

I'm like ooh, ooh, ooh, it's goin' down in this bitch
Pull off bust a hundred rounds on this bitch
All my nigga dawgs is dawg pound in this bitch
And if I ever go down like you betta keep it, shh

'Cause, girl, it get no better
Looks sitting right hairy like a wool sweater
Seems like ever since I start stackin' cheddar
Putty tat chase me everywhere like Sylvester

Droppin' jaws faster than my eyes can undress her
Diggin' like a pirate try and find the hidden treasure
Hundred pack of rubbers like I'm a try and break a record
Baby girl, say she buy whatever so it's

Lights, camera, action, you dig
Lights, camera, action, you dig
It's showtime, it's showtime
Show me yours, show you mine

Lights, camera, action, you dig
Lights, camera, action, you dig
It's showtime, it's showtime
Show me yours, show you mine
