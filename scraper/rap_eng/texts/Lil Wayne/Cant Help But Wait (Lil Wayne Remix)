Ok, shawty lemme holla atchya
You need a man who won't holla atchya
Won't throw a dolla atchya
And listen when you speak
And when we make love you can holla at me
But when you wake up shawty say she gotta leave
Man I wish I was dumb so I can set her free
Cuz thats freedom do you understand me
Baby I know im a blood but let ya other man be

[Trey Songz]

Make it go ooh, ooh ooh ooh

[Trey Songz]
Girl I can’t help but wait
Till you get that with him it don’t change
Girl I can't wait
Till you see that with me it ain’t the same
Girl I can't wait
Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I can’t help but wait

[Trey Songz]
Listen, It ain't fresh to just let him call the shots
For the queen you should be gettin all that someones got
You should be rockin the latest purses bracelets and watchs
Your worth much more then an occasional I love you
Im thinking of you
And baby girl its getting to the point where I can't take no more[i can't take no more]

[Lil Wayne]
I got patience
Doc carter baby yea I got patience
Pullin up on you in a humee
And somethin as wide as a sony flat screen
Watchin tony montana like I never seen
But I can hear ur heart screamin lemme redeam it
Cuz he dont know what he doin he just interveining
He’s an inconvenient, inconvenience
Its simple seince
I ment science better yet math
Me plus you baby girl lets add
And we never divide and we just subtract
His punk ass my class ill pass
We pass pens and the pads
I ain't worried about that
I never look back
Your boyfriend wack
Wonder why I call him that?
Because a real man never talk with his hands
Boy you a girl girl you grand
Like ten hundred dolla bills you grand
And girl ima g tell ya girls about me
And ima only beat dat spot
If you sweet ima hit ya sweet spot
And he not
I can make it sound like a little teapot
And if dat nigga hurt you ima kiss you till it stop
Im on the clock
