[Bow Wow]
Now she an angel straight from heaven
And I can love her forever now
From Orlando but its magic when we both together
Plus the momma on her own shit
Porsche all red whip
And she stunting like me
And she on her own
Lil mama she from Queens
Like latifah she my queen
And I ain't TIP girl but I can be your king
Its nothing she special
My butterfly like Mariah
Im addicted to her love and like a drug be my supplier
And I'll eat you like a pastry
Girl ain't no faking me
Fuck a lil piece
Baby I will give you all of me
G5 planes when it's time to take them trips
Shopping sprees buy it up
Girl I spoil you, you like milk
Hit the backseat of my Maybach
Me and you alone
Watching runs house episodes
With them curtains closed
I'm a wife her, I like her
She a knock out like Tyson
I only want you, there ain't another girl like you

[Lil Wayne & Bow Wow Chorus]
Girl i know you got a man
But u gotta understand
That the nigga can't treat you like I can
Shorty can I be your man
Your man, your man
Shorty can I be your man
Your man, your man
Shorty and look i know I did you wrong girl
That wasn't the plan
And can I take it back I got a question
Can I be your man, your man, your man
Shorty, can I be your man
Your man, your man

[Bow Wow]
See girl without ya
I'm lost, no map, no atlas
No GPS, baby no one can
Got the same tattoo
See mine is on my arm
Yours is right behind your ear
She my lucky charm
And I ain't mean you no harm
In the beginning I was tripping
When I be out on the road, she the only thing Im missing
I miss your kisses, miss you hugs, way you loving
Miss your touches, acting like I ain't like it
Knowing damn well I was fronting
I was bugging, and all these other broads mean nothing
And you can call me your cop cos Im a do major hand cuffing
Then she, she, she, she super bad, like McLovin
Then i like when she call me baby, and she like when I call her muffin,damn, you was all I needed, when you feeling down you lean on me like Morgan Freeman,when see, when she be around, i be feeling more than free,but I got this feeling that she love her work more than she love me

[Chorus]

Hold up, hold up
She make a me wanna sing, she make me wanna sing
Lil mama um in dis both jus singin to ya
You know you can't do it like I can
So so just let me be her man

Nigga wanna sing to her
Nigga wanna sing to her
Let us both sing to ya
Let us both sing to ya

[Chorus]
[End]
