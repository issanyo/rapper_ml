[Verse 1]
Tyga
It's breaktime these kids is caught like Dateline
Deep fine obliterate if you dare to take mine
Genocide we don't give a fuck color or size guys
Women children could see I'm the shrine for the fucking blind
Vietnam mama BORN , her son know nothing but war
Whom tattoos the boy choose
I'm winnin by 4 steps steppin ahead of ya'll
Cap a don college never was sent to school
Testin me students never do
Teach niggas cold then a pair of weather
Don't worry if it's red or blue
Green fake shit like tours do
Passenger grab the damager in case they start askin us
Managers show manners cause they see me on cameras (nigga)
Word of mouth tyga travelin tourin the south
Haters gatherin gossip shit I know nuthin about
You round cows sittin around I'm milkin yo spouse
Hey mr. child owners honored to have a rappers smile
Yiffey yup know a bitch that'll stick a nigga up
I don't fuck with her seen ya'll in the club huggin dumb
Dumb what the hell are you on?
Tomorow yo shit'll be pawned
Withdrawled credit cards
All at the salon gettin done up
My chain look like a muffler
3d 50gs never tuck it
Til the g shit happens when you touch it
Those guys was nuthin
Put comics in my luggage
Next to condoms cause I'm like fuck it
No, pause games, I'm 19 with lots of bunnies
Young money my dougy
Kicks Pierre Hardy
I'm rich if you wonderin sales rep don't bug me
Accounts with large amounts you little pocket money
Car body sylvester color
I'm somewhat of a son from a different cuttin
Juice n buttons pussycat tygas comin
Like shapes on new hummers
Patience young patrient
This is now god talkin
Bought a twin cause niggas ain't close to him
Potion clone n patron n a sober bitch
Hopin hopefully ya cloweys them I'm jizzin all over it
Dope women fuckin position ya ass where my tummy is
She definitly did put on for her city
Two smut nasty chick nothing wrong with fraud titties
It's right left til I'm outta breath
In a seth ya neck ya chest
I'm wreckless with weapons is letters betta speak ya best shit
Like presidents over ya front ya residents
Camo vision like predators
Or cause yo jealosy
Talkin like you knew GED
We da new bulls of 93
Can't defeat young money
It's breaktime
[Verse 2}

Lil Wayne
But I never take a break
I never take a break till I see heaven on the gates
I stick that metal in ya face and now they call you chrome face
Fuck with me betta bring yo lunch cause it's gon be a long day
Fuck what ya heard like my dick against yo eardrum
Swagga so sharp weezy where you get the spear from?
I could make you the son yo mama never hear from
Let that tough talk walk and watch how you fear run
Yah, and fuck the world is my assignment
And I promise you gon feel me like blind men
Roll or roll over like front wheel alignment
Tell the lil rappers don't come near the giant
Ugh now I'm smellin my self
Flow sicker than shit where the hell is my health
Startin to feel like Makaveli myself
Watch I put that muthafuckin Mac 11 to your scalp
Yes my maybach I swear that bitch a donkey
Had to get the long body cause the choufer didn't want me
Muthafucka I'm hungry still
Greedy that's why my first week I got a mill
It's young money open the bar
If they don't know who you is I bet they know who you are
No kelly just n.o. and l.a
We come to fuck shit up like broke levays
Got a california bitch I swear she a medic
Sometimes she give me head and just git rid of my headache
Pull up and shoot like J.J. Reddick
Put on my boot I think I'm ready
Which one of you niggas wanna g get it?
Keepin yo head up but your beheaded uh oh
Realest is my middle name my heart pump nitrogen
And I breathe fire better stand by a hydrogen
Duffle bag big enough to fit the rifle in
I'll cut yo ass short call me hyphen then
Yes I'm focused on the figgas fresh
I'm cool smokin like a cigarette
It's the president sittin behind the bigger desk
Secretary with bigger breats
Handin me bigger checks
I'm goin at these niggas necks
Which one of you niggas next
I put a bullet in yo muthafuckin intelect
Call me koo koo nest carter
A wfb and that's for wells fargo
Bank can't thank I'm on that drank
Anythang make my mind go blank
And the judge trynna hit me with everything but the sink
But I won't sink I can't I ain't
Breaktime
