[Intro: Danjahandz]
Ah, Danja and the Clutch
I miss you girl, I miss you girl
I'mma make you my official girl

[Verse 1: Cassie]
Listen, today makes it a year
Don't you think it's time that you made it clear?
You gotta get on your biz
Tell me what it ain't or what it is
I can handle it
I've had it up to here
I don't wanna pressure you, dear
I've sent back to back dudes away from my door
Thinking I was spoken for
Not anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Cassie]
And I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
Of being your (your) unofficial girl, unofficial girl
And I'm tired, I'm tired of trying (ooh, but I'm still your)
I'm still your (your) unofficial girl

[Chorus: Cassie]
(You gotta learn to love)
You gotta love me in the light and the dark
You gotta give me, give me all of your heart
I wanna be your (be your) official girl, official girl
Said I wanna, wanna, wanna be your (be your) official girl
I wanna be your official girl, I wanna be your
Official girl, official girl, official girl

[Verse 2: Cassie]
If you keep this up there's bound to be a mess
Cause I ain't really like the rest
Put to the test
I can surely pass (yeah)
You better do the math
I'm so stylish (check)
So bossy (check)
It'd be a shame to say you lost me
But if you want that
It's a wrap and I won't look back
(And I won't look back)

[Pre-Chorus: Cassie]
And I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
Of being your (your) unofficial girl, unofficial girl
And I'm tired, I'm tired of trying (hey, ooh)
I'm still your (your) unofficial girl, unofficial girl

[Chorus: Cassie]
(You gotta learn to love)
You gotta love me in the light and the dark
You gotta give me, give me all of your heart
I wanna be your (be your) official girl, official girl
Said I wanna, wanna, wanna be your (be your) official girl
I wanna be your official girl, I wanna be your
(Said I wanna be your) Official girl, official girl, official girl

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Shorty say she wanna be my official
Bang bang, I ain't talking no pistol
Ain't no violence, ain't no silence
Cause she scream to the top of her
When I get on top of her
Sounding like an opera
Skip, drop, hopping her
Got her feeling popular
Got her feeling like she's, she's my official girl
Yeah, you so special girl
I'll never diss you and I'll kiss you on your little pearl
I know you like that baby, yeah you like that baby
I know I can make you come right back baby

[Cassie]
Said I wanna be your official girl

[Danjahandz]
I miss you girl, I miss you girl
I'mma make you my official girl

[Cassie]
You better act right
I'm two seconds from being out the door

[Danjahandz]
Uh, I miss you girl, I miss you girl
I'mma make you my official girl

[Bridge: Cassie]
Said I won't be with you unofficially anymore
And I can't make you choose
Long as you're cool on knowing
You're 'bout to blow a good thing
And I ain't making ultimatums
I'mma tell you like this verbatim

[Hook: Cassie]
And I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
Of being your (your) unofficial girl (don't wanna be unofficially yours)
And I'm tired, I'm tired of trying (and I'm so tired of trying to make you see me)
I'm still your (your) unofficial girl, unofficial girl (don't wanna be unofficially)

[Chorus: Cassie]
(You better learn, learn, learn)
You gotta love me in the light and the dark
You gotta give me, give me all of your heart
I wanna be your (be your) official girl, official girl
Said I wanna, wanna, wanna be your (be your) official girl
I wanna be your official girl, I wanna be your
Official girl, official girl, official girl

[Danjahandz]
Uh, I miss you girl, I miss you girl
I'mma make you my official girl (my official girl, yeah)

[Outro: Lil' Wayne]
Yes you can be my official girl (my official girl, yeah)
Cause you can be my official girl, girl
