[Intro: Lil Wayne]
(Oh) Yeah
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, brrrr
It's our paradise (oh)
Yeah (oh)
And it's our war zone

[Verse 1: ZAYN & (Lil Wayne)]
Climb on board (Mula baby)
We'll go slow and high tempo (Yeah)
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

[Bridge: ZAYN & (Lil Wayne)]
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together (He the one, she the two)
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you

[Chorus: ZAYN & (Lil Wayne)]
So we'll piss off the neighbors (Tunechi baby)
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior (she come to the zoo)
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw (yeah)
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone (pop, pop, pop, pop, brrrr, paradise and our war zone)
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & (ZAYN)]
(Pillow talk)
Fuckin' and fightin', fuckin' and fightin'
Yeah, fuck it
If she love it, I like it, husband and wifey
We do what we do
We do how we do but we making it through
And the bedroom a zoo
We fuss for a few, then we fuck for a truce, yeah
She's something to do when there's nothing to do
We so ugly and cute, but the love is the proof
Never chucking the deuce, never coming unloose, woo
Put my tongue in her noose, out my thumb in her 'boose
Make her jump through the roof, now she touching the moon
And she love when we spoon, she gon' cum and boo-hoo
When she cummin' it's through

[Chorus: ZAYN & (Lil Wayne)]
So we'll piss off the neighbours (aye)
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears (Tunechi)
Yeah, reckless behavior (Mula baby)
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on (yeah)
It's our paradise and it's our war zone (it's our paradise)
It's our paradise and it's our war zone (pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop, brrrr)

[Verse 3: ZAYN & (Lil Wayne)]
If anybody knows that's just how the game goes
In a few weeks she'll be somebody's, yo
I got too many seeds, they all gotta go
No, I didn't conceive, but I got one goal
And yes, I felt the seed but I don't no more
Now I'll fuck her ten times 'cause I don't get bored
Standing in halls where the great men shine
They were your dreams and the reason I mind
You would have held me back and you wouldn't let me go
You would have told me no, you would have told me yes
Would have stayed the night, then we'd probably have sex
And we know it ain't right but there's stuff that comes next
(It's our paradise and our war zone)
(It's our paradise and our war zone)

[Chorus: ZAYN & (Lil Wayne)]
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior (Tunechi baby)
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw (yeah)
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone (pop, pop, pop, pop, paradise and our war zone, yeah)
It's our paradise and it's our war zone (pop, pop, pop, pop, brrr)
