(Chorus:)
Ok I Know 2 Girls Dat Don Did It Before
But I Wonder If Dey Know Dat We Did It Before
If The Other Girl Know Dat We Did It Before

Shit I Wonder If She Know Dat We Did It Before

(Verse 1:)

And Now Ur Girl Lookin At Ya Cause She Didn't Had Know
And Now Everybody Sayin Dat U Did It Before
And U Know Dats Because Dey Probably Didn't Before

(Verse 2:)
Yea... So If You Did It Before
Be A Pro U Got To Act Like U Did It Before
And Every Time I Meet A Girl Dat Say She Didn't Before
U Know I Got To Act Like I Never Did It Before
But She Would Be Dumb If She Didn't Had Know
Dat I Did It Before
Cause I Did It Before
And She Would Be Dumb To Think I Didn't Had Know

Dat She Did It Before
She Probably Did It Galore
So We Did It Some More
And We Did It Some More
Like Busta Rhyme Said She Holla Give Me Some More
So We Did It Some More
Yea We Did It Till Four
And When 4:01 Came She Was Hitten the Door
Not Fixin' To Go
But she Was Hittin' Da Door
And I Was Probably Butt Naked Just Twistin' Da O
Den I Call My Homies Up And Kick Da Shit How It Go
And I Know They Gone Laugh Cause They Did It Before

(Chorus:)
Ok I Know 2 Girls Dat Done Did It Before
But I Wonder If Dey Know Dat We Did It Before
If The Other Girl Know Dat We Did It Before
Shit I Wonder If She Know Or If She Didn't Had Know
Dat We Did It Before
Yea We Did It Before
Shit I Wonder If She Know Or If She Didn't Had Know
Dat We Did It Before
Yea We Did It Before
Shit I Wonder If She Know Dat We Did It Before

(Verse 3:)
