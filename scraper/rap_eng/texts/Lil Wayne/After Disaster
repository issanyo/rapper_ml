When the planes hit
Whats going on my nigga

We holds our heads high after disaster

[Hook]

[verse 1]
They couldn't kill me holla if u feel me
Hurricane Katrina victim in the building
Okay, day time soldier, night time rider
911 survivor,yeah I feel u, and who am
I to try to keep hope alive
When I'm seeing dead babies floating by
Damn, burning buildings, flamed up,they couldn't take da heat so they jumped. Man, they want to want to transform the streets we grew up on
A deck of cars with no aces luck gone
Uhh, tower 1 fell, tower 2 fell, now everybody screwed like loose nails
I'm like what are we to do with a house with no roof
Look up and pray to whose above you
God, yeeup, now just look in your seat, black people, white people, all covered in debris, yeaah

[verse 2]
Try to keep our head up, and not get fed up, nope, but it seems like they won't let us. Yea, and I was told that life ain't shit and this world ain't neither
This is why I scream fuck the world not the people, Nope. Yes, but in the belly of the beast, people get swallowed like meat, eat
And your president was lying while my people was dying
In the helicopter flying looking down reading signs, Help SOS, somebody save us, attend at his side, where our savior
And, I've seen tragedy I've look it in the eye
Ain't being at ma lowest so I choose to get high. High, so high, that my name should be sky, its a bird its a plane, no its I
Yea, I holla five on four till they bury me man
I'm the father of New Orleans and I'm a family man, you heard me

When the levees broke

Now, if i should die before my time, lord take care of jew jew and his mom please, take care of little jah please, take care all the kids please, cause through us they live. yeah, lord please keep your eyes on me, and if i die, i pray my soul you keep, and i don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak. I can't take much more, i just want to be free. Free, they said they knew there was a problem with the levees, and they did nothing, nothing. Clinton approved da money, and Bush did nothing. Nothing. So, Katrina hit, and three days later, Fema just commin. I'm feeling like what the hell is really goin on, planes hittin buildings, whats next king kong? I wish we didn't even have a reason for this song, but we do, moment of silence for the people that's gone. Shhhhh. To those restin in peace, those dead and deceased, soon again we meet. Or til im high and drunk and my cars swerves off road, haa. I'll meet you at the crossroads. Lord please keep your eyes on me, and if i die i pray my soul you keep, and i don't want this world to kill me, but im getting so weak, i can't take much more, i just be free
