[Chorus: Bon Iver]
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, when we fall
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, when we fall
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, save us all (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
God save us all, I pray for y'all
You know the tables turned, I buy a table cloth
I got it off the ground, and now it's straight to Mars
Shout out to the pilots that died takin' off
The crime rate evolve, but I take the charge
I try to obey the law, on Fridays it's hard
Vibrating floors for my groundbreaking bars
The crowd gave applause then the clouds gave us stars
When all faith is lost, you just gotta say the thoughts
Can't let us down, pause, fast forward, play, record
It's a lake to cross, hope you make it straight across
To make it safe across, we leave when we should take a cross
And when the day gets dark, that's when the fire start
They cryin' "Amen amen," the third times the charm
Brenda's got a baby, I pray it's not my baby
Say it's not my baby, and my response is "Amen"

[Chorus: Bon Iver]
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, when we fall
