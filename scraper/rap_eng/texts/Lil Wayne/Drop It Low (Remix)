[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Ester Dean]
If ya ass too big, I make ya back that ass up
I only go down if ya keep your grass cut
Hair to the back, hat to the front
Weezy F. baby, tatted on the butt
Okay, still remixin’ with one of these vixens
I make her ride me like I’m Sea Biscuit
Ms. Ester Dean, you can get it
Look, I like a nice two pack and a booty on biggie
What's really good? What you know about it?
Swagger too good, I should notarize it
Yeah, they call me Tune, no Bugs Bunny
Make the booty clap, give it up for me
Yeah, it’s Young Money, you know I bring money
I make that booty talk, Connie Chung for me
I got her butt naked in a red Snuggie
I make her drop it low like she duckin' from me
Now where she at? Ayy, where she at? Ayy
There she go, ayy, there she go, ayy
She bring it back, ayy br-bring it back, ayy
Then she drop it low, ayy, drop it low, ya dig

[Verse 2: Ester Dean]
Oh, they wanna see me drop it, drop it, drop it
Wanna pop it, pop it, pop it, shake that ass on the floor
You wanna see me shake it, shake it, shake it
Yeah, you like it, like it, like it when I drop it real low

[Pre-Chorus: Ester Dean]
Oh, yeah boy, you like that
Oh, I can tell that you like that
Oh, yeah boy, you love it when my booty goes
Boom, ba-ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom, boom

And move that thang around and move that thang around
He said move that thang around and move that thang around
And move that thang around and move that thang around
