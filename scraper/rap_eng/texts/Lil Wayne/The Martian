I pop my trunk and everybody get to running
The "fireman" bitch like my body in the oven
I'm one egg short, I'm just tryin' to get a dozen
My name like honey, it got a lot of bitches buzzing
The neck of the barrel is so long and narrow
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunchin' and Monch like Pharoahe
Bloodshot eye's on the sparrow
And I stay high, but on-point like an arrow
Street nigga baby I'm in love with the gravel
Money gives me life like a man with a gavel
I'm strapped at home, I'm strapped when I travel
I pop my trunk and made them bitches spread like cattle

Live from the 504 it's Mr. Crazy flow
Jumping like a bungee no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go
Nowhere I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down it's going down
Like there's a whale in the boat
See you can smell that I smoke
And yep I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination that make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water yep I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the squid
L-lilly pad niggas l-look at the monster
Y-you don't want to crash like la la labambas

I got them 24 inches, sittin on them Joe Buddens
And the trunk straight jumping, bitch I can't hear nothin'
Though I might do the Spurs, sittin' on them Tim Duncan's
And in that lamborghini, I do donuts like dunkin
How come every bad bitch with a pussy, wanna fuck 'em
But I just feed 'em drugs, and watch 'em fuck each other
My neck was 100, and my wrist was another
It make her pussy wet, I leave that bitch with a puddle
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I should rap with a muzzle
Peyton Manning flow, I just go no huddle
Baby girl gettin' straight dick, no cuddle
You know I'm out this world, I just bought a space shuttle
