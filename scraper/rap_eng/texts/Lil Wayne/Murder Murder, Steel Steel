Gangsta Gudda, Gudda muhfucker

Slim cat, send em where ya brim at & trim that
And at ya funeral, I don't why they sing this little light of mine, cause I dim that

Y'all can't get that, flowing off that shit that
Come out that fat booga sack now I'm in the back with the Mac like

Its been giving but you ain't hear it till ya like me
So therefore they're whores until they like me
This shit is hell boy, or what it might be
I'm 90 proof hustler, 10% human
Get the shit gloomy, strip the strip boomin
Get the script screwed in
Nina Ross get the clip screwed in, get ya clique screwed up
Me & my clique screwed up like the screwed up clique
Got the purple juice poured up the squad up sip
Then a purple coupe pulled up like "squad up here"
Bitches riding with niggas like "let me outta here"
My flow is very outta here
Listen ma, I know I say I get us here
But look dear ya baby boy went and got a year
Now I have not a fear

Man y'all don't want that troule man, that was trouble right there

Shoes on the gray 5
Blues any fool tryna take mines
Been a fool since I was yay high
Stay high puffin Hershey, eyes yay high
Mami wanna ride you gotta mace mines
I mean put ya fuckin face by my waistline
Gudda going hard at a bitch I don't waste time
I'm from the state line where niggas get they cake like a baked pie
It's the city where the blocks is burnin, rocks and burners
The shit that keep ya pockets splurgin
Its Gudda Gudda watch the wheels when the drop is turnin
Like my  wrist a lot of ice when the watch is turnin
Not concerned with dope fiends who's pockets hurtin
Squad up when we drop shits locked for certain

[Lil Wayne Talking:]
Shits locked man
Click clack man

They say I'm too young, to know about the shit that I be talkin about
Man that's the shit I be talkin about
But fuck the world and what they talkin about
If they ain't talkin bout this, then they ain't talkin bout shit
Listen I gotta, quarter of block, I stretch it let it harden & rock
Then show the hood what a bargain about, fuck
I got shop I call it stock
Not on wall street I put the shit on y'all street now y'all feast
Yo word to the highest above
If so happen my raps don't fly I flip pies & such
Use my school knowledge mix science withdrugs
& I'm smart enough to know I'ma die as a thug
Nigga life's nothing but getting high off the bud, cause after that I feel like I could just die in love
For the streets I got dying love, 2 teardrops I'm crying for all my dying thugs
Embrace my pistol with bear-lion hugshugs, keep trying you lie in blood
Man nigga I breath iron man m-my heart pump lion blood
And when I roar I grow wings and fly high above
Birdman, Junior in the skies above
The turbulance in the air make my tires rubs
I'm bout to drop down, Fee line me up
Perfect landing like (whistle noise)
"Hi, wassup?"
