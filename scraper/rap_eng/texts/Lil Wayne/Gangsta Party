Feat. Lil B
[Lil Wayne]
I got a whole lotta money, pop that pussy for me
My homie got that yopper, he'll bang it at a copper
Ay! Gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Stove on my waist, cook yo' ass up - gourmet
All-black .44, do you want fo'play?
I'm goin at your face like Oil of Olay
No champagne, but you know my flag Rosé
Swagger on steroids -- Canseco, José
No Limit Records, we so +Bout It, Bout It+
I'm higher than a bitch, feel like I climbed a fuckin mountain
Illest nigga you know, my accountant's still countin
Shot hit him a minute ago, but his body's still bouncin
Beam on the hammer, beam on ya forehead
Gotta kill the witnesses 'cause Birdman car red
Hollygrove Monster, Eagle Street creature
Come to your funeral, kill everybody but the preacher
I live in Miami, nigga I'll South Beach ya
Robin Leach, uh, THAT'S how we ballin
You know that I'm loaded, but please don't think it's sweeter
Beat one of you bitch niggas up like John Cena
Them hoes on Young Money, tell them hoes we comin
Boy, we get it poppin, we ain't savin hoes, we swappin
Yeah, gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Big head Desert Eagle, call it shotty
How'd you get that money? Stunna taught me that
That Zan took me under, patron brought me back
I'm leanin on these muddahfuckers like I caught a flat
And that Glock snap back like a old Starter hat, HA~!
What the lick read? I'm in the big league
I'm a breath of fresh air, let the bitch breathe!
I'm tryna to chillax but I had to do it, death
I'm at the funeral like "I had to do it, Rev!"
Mack you my big brother, I split a wig for you
Put that on their repeat, until they bury me
Moment of clarity, yeah that's my diamond game
I keep a fine bitch, 'cause I like the finer things
He-haha! ...Fuck with me slime
No brain on the whip, I've got nothin in mind, haha
Carter IV! They ain't fuckin with mine
I drop that "Sorry 4 the Wait" to make up for the time, YEA!

[Lil B]
Yeah I do my thang, bitch what's up?
Young Based God, came in with the ballers
Iced-out chain, bitch, I'm rich off that same shit
Sixty-five hoes on my dick, bitch it's Christmas
Straight Westside, Bay Area bitch I'll grave em
Pretty boy shit, Based God from the angles
On like a cradle and you niggas can't stop me
Shouts out to Mack Maine, gettin rich and cocky
Bitch it's still Westside, shouts out to Weezy
Young Based God with that fifty-five heater
187 bitch, I-I pull a 2-11 bitch
With that tiny shirt mayne, and that...tiny pants mayne (Meow...swag!)
I'm on Based World and I fuck wit, Cash Money niggas
Don't understand man, the game like a chain, mayne
That WOO! WOO! Swag, bitch! Brr-rang-dang-dang-dang mayne
Bruh, off the top, I'm a Wolfpack hitter
Man, my life just a painting, and I, paint you a picture, mayne
