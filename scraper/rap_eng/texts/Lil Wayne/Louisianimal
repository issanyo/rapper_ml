Get down or lay down

I'mma animal Louisanimal

[Lil Wayne]
I got em
Call me Lil Weezy-ana Carter
I go harder
All about a dollar, fuck two quarters
Bitch I'll pour syrup in that Vitamin Water
I hope you die ugly and tonight'll be gorgeous
Feed me your organs, bitch I'm starving
Tear drops on my face like it's my party
And if it's my party I can cry if I want to
Split your fucking body up in half if I want to
Bitch I'm from New Orleans but I'm going everywhere
And I have a dream to be your worst nightmare
I'm in the kings chair watching Sportcenter
Then I cut on BET, ah dinner
Through your Ls up cause we taking over
And we hungry so please come with a chip on your soldier
And we got them guns that gotta sit on your shoulder
I rock ice but my heart colder
