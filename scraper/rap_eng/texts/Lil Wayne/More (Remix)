[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Get a check, get another check
Flip another check, fuck a bitch
'Fore I fucked 'em all, I done fucked 'em all
Let me say this, in a drop-top coupe
That's how I bag them all, I swear to money
I need more

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Walk up out that bank, cop up anything
Money ain't a thing, but I need more of that thing
The world need more like Wayne
Baby, what you think?
She said, "All you do is bang"
I said, "What you think?"
But I need more from her
If she ain't fuckin', it's fine
'Cause I got more than her
So be more alert, do more than twerk
Get more bitches for daddy
Be more diverse, fuck more than me
And do more to her
I'm more unique when I do more of the Percs
No more CMB, and, sure, it hurts
But I'm more complete, wish I knew more at first

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Get a check, get another check
Flip another check, fuck a bitch
'Fore I fucked 'em all, I done fucked 'em all
Let me say this, in a drop-top coupe
That's how I bag them all, I swear to money
I need more

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Ayy, they lookin' at me like a water fountain
The way I'm flowin', flowin', flowin', flowin'
They lookin' at me like a water fountain
The way I'm goin', goin', goin', goin'
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
I'm so up, yeah, I feel like I'm on the top floor
Life so dangerous, the Bible in the top drawer
One question: gotta tell me what you'd die for
Ayy, go Forrest, to the money, run Forrest, yeah
Hot boys, yeah, we really hot boys, yeah
Your girl, yeah, she really not yours, ayy, ayy
Got the key to the streets
Been pushin' so long, don't need a key
Got the key to the streets, yeah, yeah
If I lose a bitch then I'ma get another one
Treat her just the same, just like the other one

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Get a check, get another check
Flip another check, fuck a bitch
'Fore I fucked 'em all, I done fucked 'em all
Let me say this, in a drop-top coupe
That's how I bag them all, I swear to money
I need more

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I'm more elite 'cause I'm more at work
I do more than work, I move more than work
I did more than dirt, I ignored them words
'Cause that shit for the birds and I need more than birds
I got more to see, I do more than search
She charge more to sleep, I charge more a verse
I need more than freaks, she do more than slurp
She a registered nurse, she gimme more of that syrup
She gimme more of that pussy, I give her more of this nut
I do no more than Tunechi, she say that more than enough
I give no more than a fuck, so fuck his and hers
That other shit for the birds and I need more than the birds

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Get a check, get another check
Flip another check, fuck a bitch
'Fore I fucked 'em all, I done fucked 'em all
Let me say this, in a drop-top coupe
That's how I bag them all, I swear to money
I need more

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
