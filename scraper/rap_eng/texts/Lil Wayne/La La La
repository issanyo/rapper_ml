[Intro]
That's right, Carter 3, come on
Yea, yea walk with me
Come go with me
It's Lil' Weezy baby, ha ha

[Hook]
And I'm just lightin' up my la
Yea, yea, yea, 1-7, Cash Money, Young Money

[Verse 1]
Born in New Orleans, raised in New Orleans
I will forever remain faithful New Orleans
I thank you New Orleans, thank you Holygrove
That's been my hood since a snotty nose
I come through the hood, suicidal doors
I used to come through the hood on the handle bars
Gat in my draws, money in my pocket, crack in my jaws
I hope it don't dissolve
And you know I'm ducking 5-0 and my Moms
Youngin' quick to go off like car alarms
Now the young'n keep his mind on the parmesan
Them other niggas ain't eatin' like a Ramadan
Spit the shit that make you feel it in your chromosomes
Got some money, put my whole damn corner on
Young Carter part 3, I'm the cornerstone
Eagle Street keep it going 'til Homer's home
And I'm just lightin' up my

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Can I kick it? Can I kick my story to y'all?
My glory in God, my faith in my flow, I pray that I go
Where no other rapper has, and when you're rappin' as
Vivid as I the limit is the sky, so I
Study B.I., I bang 2Pac
I hum Aaliyah and Soulja Slim was a leader
Who am I not to follow greatness?
I give these MCs hell like they all atheists
Tell them hatin' niggas "one" like they in the Matrix
And tell the cops I can buy my own bracelets
I'ma keep the paper running like a pair of ASICS
Used to sport the Gucci Bucks, nigga no laces
Striped polo, five-pocket Girbaud
Mama got her tubes tied, I'm rockin' dolo
I used to have the starter jacket with the logo
And the hat, me myself I had the N-O
That's the Saints, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's Lil' Wayne and I'ma shine in the rain
Now nothin' gets cleared without me signin' my name
I'm just headlinin' the game
Won't quit until I'm A-Rod in the game
They ridin' the bench, they not in the game
I misplaced the key, to the lock and chain
My spot remain, like a bleach stain, or cranberry
It's Murder She Wrote like Angela Lansbury
I remember being small, man
New toys when my mama won the card game
Got my gifts before Christmas, then have to wait for them
I had a ten-speeder, scooter, and a skateboard, haha!
Then we moved to the suburbs
Me and Lil' Toya Johnson was love birds, aww man!
And I swear I feel born again
I'm in the buildin' like the audience
Just lightin' up my

[Hook]
