[Hook: Belly]
Trap, trapping with the money in the sofa
All I smoke is loud, she get high off my aroma
My whole squad we the brand new cosa nostra
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)

[Verse 1: Belly]
Told her stay and listen, you can pay attention
You can say it's tripping just to pay tuition
You can say you're different, that don't make a difference
Just like all the bitches I know
Won't catch me slipping, I'm just syrup sipping
I don't pose for pictures, I'm just being different
I'm too real with it but you're always tripping
Just like all the bitches I know

[Refrain: Belly]
Vibe, I think I'm catching a vibe with you
Vibe, I think I'm catching a vibe with you
Vibe, I think I'm catching a vibe with you
Slide, I might just pull up and slide with you

[Hook: Belly]
Trap, trapping with the money in the sofa
All I smoke is loud, she get high off my aroma
My whole squad we the brand new cosa nostra
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I ain't never sober, Codeine in the soda
Kush from California, coke across the border
Drugs get imported, love ain't important
These niggas ain't important
These niggas ain't my whodies
I got baggies baggies baggies
She got a fatty and it's tatted
I got a habit and it's tragic
But fuck it, if I die I'm high I'm happy
OMG it's Tunechi Lee, I sip, I drink
Pop two, pop three
And just be free and just be me
They will critique I just keep keep
I'm pouring up and slowing down
We going up, it's going down
We throwing up because you know that more than enough is never enough
We pour a little more in her cup and measure it for what
And these bitches already know we setting them up
Gotta bump it like some motherfuckin' exzema bumps
They naked in pumps
My goons say they're checkin' the chumps
And when it comes to drugs never give up
Young Mulah!

[Hook: Belly]
Trap, trapping with the money in the sofa
All I smoke is loud, she get high off my aroma
My whole squad we the brand new cosa nostra
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)
Oh my God bitch, we barely ever sober (Oh my God)

[Refrain: Belly]
Vibe, I think I'm catching a vibe with you
Vibe, I think I'm catching a vibe with you
Vibe, I think I'm catching a vibe with you
Slide, I might just pull up and slide with you
