Let's get fucked up
On the road to riches
You just a speed bump
Funny how the heater make a nigga freeze up
We smoke a tree down til it's just a tree stump
That eastside nigga, bang on you bitches
I'm going at your neck, strangle you bitches
Got a long-ass list full of bad-ass bitches
And I stay burned-out like a bad transmission
I'm on, like the lights I light up
The kush, knock out, Mike Tyson fight
I'm talking about ass and titties
Sex and the city
Weezy f baby and the f is for "forget it"
I'm loving my shine, sipping on fine wine
Up in some fine dime then she give me Einstein
Young money motherfucka
Yeah we picked a fine time
I'm a 17 nigga, bitch, I don't mind dyin' man
I just ended up on every bitch's sex list
Genie in the bottle get a muthafuckin deathwish
Thugga in this bitch, he say fuck y'all niggas
Breaking buds down the size of a football nigga
Red beam, gimme the light, no Sean Paul nigga
Let nino bust in your face like a porn star nigga
Yeah I keep the brian pumper, no homo
The shit I'm on got the world moving in slow-mo
Man, I told mack I was gonna do it
Above the law, but under the influence
Man, I was on the skateboard
Kick push swagger, got my girl to the room
Got behind her like a shadow
I had her ass up in the air
I swear I got the largest clip in the world
Right here in my gat
And I wish a nigga play
I'mma bust a nigga's ass
Hate young money? then fuck you in the ass
187 and a hockey mask, ymcmb gonna ball
Til we fall. and this fuck all y'all
Gonna ball til we fall. and this fuck all y'all
We straight, sorry for the wait
