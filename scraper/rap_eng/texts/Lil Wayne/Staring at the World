[Intro]
Weed and syrup, yeah
Who we is? Young Mooolah, baby!
Got that right shorty
Bigg D on the track!

[Hook]
I'm just, staring at the world
From a Cadillac window, baby
Hoping this girl in my passenger don't act funny with me
Get her to my home, we get naked like some new born babies
I'm ready to perform and she's gon' be my audience
And she said "Bravo"
And I said "I know"
And she said "Encore"
Girl, I'm really big on you
So what you wanna do?
Too fly you need a parachute
But that just means you're falling in love

[Verse 1]
In love with a skater
Five six seven, man, I already ate her
She had a coffee mug and a pair of Uggs
Got some makeup on my shirt when she gave me a hug
Shorty got me open
Pussy so good wish I could smoke it
Where your mans at?
Remember me like this one time at band camp, yeah!
Like that man, she on my mind all day, check my CAT scan
Hey, where you going with all that?
I fuck her till she whine and then I drink a tall glass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Girl you gon' make me take you
To your desired destination
Left leg, right leg, segregation
Cause I know you like that shit, cause I love that shit
Girl that's my hole, I dug that ditch
And when it gets cold, I'm there for her to hold
She climbs my pole, beat that pussy like she stole something
And she so fine
From the front from the side from behind
Pop that pussy like a cork and I'mma fuck you till you whine

[Hook]
