[Lil Wayne]
Hat to the front
Lookin' like I'm lightin' up a bat for a blunt
I'm stickin' to the script, tryna kick it like a punt
My life is like a movie and I do my own stunts
I'm the Birdman Jr., call me young Baby
Coulda been a killer but Cash Money saved me
Remember I was little but the cash money made me
Big dog bitch, no tramp, no lady
Young ass nigga had a thing for old ladies
But as I got older I began to like 'em younger
To heavens where I brung her, My wing she was under
She said "Daddy they, daddy they, daddy they, daddy they
Daddy they can't do it like you can"
I get chips like Vegas and I am not blue man
Too much ice on my wrist and now I got a blue hand
And if I sing Prostitute she gon' need some new pants
And if I sing Pussy Monster she gon' need a new man
Hello world, I would you all to meet me, her new man
I vow to stay on top of my Somers like Suzanne
And I hustle everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday I'm hustlin', fillin' up my cup again
Wit that purple stuff again, I can't get enough of it
Point me in the direction of a swisher and I'm stuffin' it
With that purple stuff again, I'm on some same color shit
After you do Wayne, it's time to do Wayne's brothers bitch
I get money like a fuckin' Wayans brother bitch
I get good with Gorillas and stay away from the rattlesnakes
And the jakes, and the fake, and the hate
Interstate 10, no cops in sight
And I'm coming back with a whole flock tonight
Lord, don't let me get stopped tonight
Or I'mma have to shoot it out with the cops tonight
I swear, and tell the jack boys not tonight
Cause I ain't 'N Sync, but I will Pop tonight
Yeah, that's right, if you ain't got that price
Then go thataway, not a way we can even negotiate
Big money heavyweight, on my way to Heaven's Gate
So if that be them open gates, flow so appropriate
Don't associate me with the bullshit
One wish, I wish a motherfucker would trip
Like a engine, I come from under the hood bitch
But now a nigga gettin' paper like a booklet
They ain't help me with it, but I took it
And now they never get it, never get it, never get it, never get it
Never get it back, yeah that's my word
"Bling-Bling" in the dictionary, yeah that's my word
And for me Ja Rule made it just like Irv
Sometimes I still go through the hood just to kiss my curb
Cause I love that block nigga, Eagle and Apple
Old G's, young G's, leaders and barrels
But God found me like a needle in a barrel
And I'm so ready for war cause I'm a Jesus for the battle
Money on my mind, that's all I think of
Married to the game, never takin my ring off
M.O.B., yeah that's my theme song
Smokin' two L's, rockin' bells like ding-dong
Haha, yeah I got my wings on
Flyer than the rest, I don't rest I keep goin
I just I-G-nore 'em
Like anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Anyway it goes, I'mma get gold
And I could see the top, the way I'm climbin this pole
A nigga with the flu ain't rhyming this cold
And nigga I'm hotter than a "fire in the hole"
Steppin' out my shower like a lion in a robe
Eyin' these hoes, iron in my hol-ster
Surp, purp, sure
Let's elevate and get away, accelerate and never hate
Dedicate this, to the blue eyes and blonde hair
I'm on top of my green like a lawn chair
Don't worry, I'm straight like arm hair
Don't worry, I'm straight like combed hair
This world fucked my Pops and I was born here
From the cell to a jet, call it Con-Air
I told my niggas that we would see
Better days yesterday, and today is a better day
Celebrate
