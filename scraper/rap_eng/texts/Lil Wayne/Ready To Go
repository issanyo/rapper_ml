[Intro]
Go fuck yourself! Limp Bizkit!
Polow! Check one two!
And I glo' it up! Oh, come on!
Yo! Boil up!
T-Turn it up!
Y'all ready for this?

[Hook: Limp Bizkit]
They say that rock-shit doesn't rock anymo'
They say the whole game done went pop, so I'm back in this hoe
We drinkin' gin till we pass out and fall on the flo'
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she told me, she ready to go
They say that rock-shit doesn't rock anymo'
They say the whole game done went pop, so I'm back in this hoe
We drinkin' gin till we pass out and fall on the flo'
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she told me, she ready to go
She ready to go, she ready to go
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she told me, she ready to go
She ready to go, she ready to go
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she told me, she ready to go

[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
Come on, back it's the motherfuckin' Rock-God
I'm so poker-faced, ladies goin' Ga-Ga
That's right, it's Freddy D, the public enemy
You know, the one to have Britney droppin' to her knees
I don't give a fuck, I probably never will
Bitch, get at me if that ass is like Jessica Biel's
Who down with me tonight? You know, I'll treat you right
You shake for me until they turnin' on them ugly lights
Throw them fingers up, and finger-fuck the sky
She like the way we pump it, I call her pumpkin pie
I ain't about to lie, I came up in it high
You got a problem? I'll bust you in your fucking eye (player!)
"Baby, you're a rockstar!", I know who the fuck I am
40 million records later, I am still the fuckin' man
I came to rock, all she wants to do is roll
Now she at my house slidin' up and down that pole

[Hook: Limp Bizkit]
They say that rock-shit doesn't rock anymo'
They say the whole game done went pop, so I'm back in this hoe
We drinkin' gin till we pass out and fall on the flo'
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she told me, she ready to go
They say that rock-shit doesn't rock anymo'
They say the whole game done went pop, so I'm back in this hoe
We drinkin' gin till we pass out and fall on the flo'
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she told me, she ready to go
She ready to go, she ready to go
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she told me, she ready to go
She ready to go, she ready to go
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she told me, she ready to go

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
What the fuck is up?
Ah, fuck the world, bust a nut
I'm on this and that, and such and such
It's ashes to ashes, dust to dust, come on!
Rock! Rock, rock with a real nigga
Everything I touch turn to gold, she a gold digger
Shots! Shots, shots, have a lil' liquor
Got the bitch takin' shots like Reggie Miller
Uh, Lil Weezy in this bitch hoe
She want the green light â€“  let the bitch go
I go hard, I go nuts, I go schizo
And now they wanna copy me like ten-fo'
Uh, I can't stop, I won't stop
I got the pistol on me, I guess I went pop
Now I'm free-fallin', yeah, head first
Red hat to the back like Fred Durst

[Hook: Limp Bizkit & Lil Wayne]
They say that rock-shit doesn't rock anymo'
They say the whole game done went pop, so I'm back in this hoe

She ready to go, she ready to go
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she told me, she ready to go
She ready to go, she ready to go
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she told me, she ready to go

[Verse 3: Fred Durst]
Lil Weezy, that's my patna, we drinkin' Russian vodka
'Bout to take your bitch 'cause she ain't never fucked a rockstar
I'm a fuckin' outlaw, packin' me a chainsaw
I'm at the afterparty, 'bout to start another brawl
I'm gettin' fucked up, so you can go to hell
I'ma need a ride home, I know myself
And you know I put it down like no one else
I'm the champ, bitch, I ain't gotta show the belt

[Hook: Limp Bizkit]
