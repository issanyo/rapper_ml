[Chorus: Ms. Thing]
I want a dude with the wickedest slam
I need a one, two, three hour man
I want a dude who will tie me to the fan
A thug that can handle his biz like a man

I need a one, two, three hour man
I want a dude who will do me in his van
A thug that can handle his biz like a man

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
OK, little mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair down her back like mine
I make her feel right when it's wrong like lying
Man, she ain't never had a love like mine
And man I ain't never seen an ass like hers
And that pussy in my mouth had me loss for words
Told her back it up like erp erp
And I made that ass jump like jerk, jerk
And that's when she...
