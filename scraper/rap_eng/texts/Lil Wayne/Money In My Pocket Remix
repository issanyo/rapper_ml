[Short Dawg - Hook]
See, see I'm steppin' out froze
Louie on my toes
All this money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Now my stacks don't fold
I got too much to hold
All this money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole

Now holla for a dollar, act strange for the change
Thats my nigga Gudda Gudda, yeah he came in the Range
My homie, Mack Maine with the shades and the chains

And me I'm so fly, I swear I came in a plane, landed in a lot
Smooth like grease, laughing at the pop, you should chews like teeth?
Fresh outfit boy, came to shut it down
And it's only gon be worn once, like a wedding gown
Somebody tell the town Short Dawgs in the annex
Pistol on my hip and I pop it like Xanex
Got them niggas trippin cause we got the hoes drippin'

You see I'm ballin' like Jordan you just a Scottie Pippen
Catch you slipping, then you better go and get ya boys
I get em work, my money longer than extension cords
Tell them runts I got some game I can sell 'em
I walk up on her, while she with them lames and I tell her

See, see I'm steppin' out froze
Louie on my toes
All this money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Now my stacks don't fold
I got too much to hold
All this money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole

[WAYNE]
Tunechi in this bitch, fresh watch me do it
Bitches know I ball, I go HAM, Cam Newton
Shorty on the pill, get this hoe some fluids
And if that bitch bad, I put her on my todo list
See I step up in this bitch like a gamma, get ya camera's

Money on the table bitch, respect my table manners
Young Money the shit, did you get the memorandom
And these other niggas think they fly im fina land them

Haa, What you doing?
I'm throwing money, they take too long with the ones
Fuck It, I'll start throwing hundreds
Gollum niggas ain't spending shit, they tippin' on a budget
Man, they pockets getting skinny, what that is Jennifer Hudson
Order a bottle and I drink it til its hollow
And my coupe is a 2 seater so you bitches gotta follow
Now buss it open backwards like the doors on a Rolls
I got money in my pocket, I got hoes on the pole

[HOOK]
See, see I'm steppin' out froze
Louie on my toes
All this money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Now my stacks don't fold
I got too much to hold
All this money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole

[Short Dawg - Verse 2]
It's young Elvis Freshly in the four door European
And the tint dark as coffee, a nigga feeling bossy
Pulling hoes like a tooth and it's hard to get em off me
I'm a stunna like the CEO of Cash Money records
The Louie V rag got me chequered with the matching kicks
Grinnin' at your chick, the surp got me leaning like 10 after 6
Therefore I tell her, go on buss it open
Goin buss it open, they call me short dawg but no I ain't from Oakland
My money so tall that you gon have to climb it
If she know how to rewind it, trust me I'm gon change the climate
And then I get behind it like I'm tryna do the heimlich
She heard that I be rhyming and I'm balling like Kurt Heinrich
She's looking for some love, but over here she will not find it
So get down on your knees, you're in the presence of Your Highness
