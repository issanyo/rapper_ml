[Hook: Gunplay]

Don't feed the apes (x4)
We got banana clips
Dont feed the apes (x4)
We got banana clips
I'm going zoo, every time I'm going through (x4)

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
I'm going dummy, I'm going zoo
I'm going raghh
Now, who is who, who can get the ruger too
Moving straight 151 and the zipper through
You Built a bird, break it down and build a bird
Shoes don't turn, shits tilts the curb
My shirt was silky when the court read the guilty word
Such a filthy word, Back to trying milky word
I'm on my get cake, pie ass nigga
I'm on my big steak, pie ass nigga
All I pitch is fish flake, pie ass nigga
All I do is check chase, plane train bicycle

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
AK with that long dick, get yo' fuckin' bone pick
I get all my groin licked, your head get flicked like a coin flip
I come through with them twin Glocks
And kill you and the nigga you was born with
Bitch I'm still the best rapper, I got bars like phone strength
I get my weed from so and so, I get my guns from such and such
And all my homies got that weight, all them niggas muscle punks
Fuck y'all niggas I'm way too strong, gettin' to the bread like Grey Poupon
Open this gun up like a book, damn Lil Tune, what page you on?
Early bird gets the worm, early dog gets the bird
High as fuck, vision blurred, unisex bullets, his or hers
You pussy cat you hiss you purr
Me, I go ape shit, on my skate shit, nigga TrukFit!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
I'm going ape shit
Spending bands on they shift
I'm show stopping shit on they shift
On they turf, footprints on they dirt
Taking all they money, I know they hurt
Champagne, Stank pot
Tattooed the shirt under my tank top
My lane lock, my chain rock
Won't move a muscle, baby set the bank vault
Bitch I whip yams, Bitch I get bands
You trying to break me bitch, slim chance
My speaker beating, my shoes kick ass
Dollar beacon game over for you Riff-Raffs
