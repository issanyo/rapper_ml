[Intro]
Nigga

(Chorus 1)
I don't like you
You don't like me
Ain't nothing but air and opportunity
And my squad and I too deep (Yeah)
So watch how you speak (Yeah)
So watch how you speak

(Verse)
I'm high, you reach
I got guys who creep
Like bon bon, je suis
Nigga i'm high, too steep
Combined with drink
My mind fried like a motherfucking
Popeyes two-piece lord
I shine, you blink
I'm wide eyed, you chink
In the pen, did my time, came out like new ink
That's why I grind to sleep
Can't even find time to eat
But I find time to freak
Yeah I find time to- (Yeah)
Uh, stop sign in my flex zone
Open sign on my trap house
You think in yo safe house
Nigga look outside we camped out
And we just got the address to your
Stash house and your last house
That's where yo mom stayin' now like
Knock knock "hello ma'am", pow
Can't tell my dogs stand down
When you pussy ass keep saying meow
I know you hear our stomach's growl
And you in here looking like chow
We gon' need an MD, cause' it's gon' be a man down
Take yo bitch and wax ass like a ShamWow, nigga

(Chorus 2)
I don't like you
And you don't like me
Ain't nothing but air and opportunity
And my squad and I too deep (Yeah)
So watch how you speak (Yeah)
