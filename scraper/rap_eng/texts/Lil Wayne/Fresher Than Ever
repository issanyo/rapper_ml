[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Yea, man we came from the bottom
Stunna told me get these niggas so I got em!
Man these women treat you different when you popping
Well I ain't tripping i'm just tryna get inside em
Deep Sea Diving
And i'm just happy that a nigga made it
And i'm able to put food on my kitchen table
Life is crazy, I remember I ain't have shit
Now i'm in the foreign, mashing on the gas quick
Gotta watch my back, these niggas hating on a young nigga
Stand up nigga; i will never run nigga
God as my witness, ima be the one nigga
Shock the world, and let em watch my kingdom come nigga
10 killers can't amount to this one nigga
I never fold, keep my hand on my gun nigga
Momma told em kill em with my music slowly
The game over, and ima cross over like Kobe
Now get it nigga!

[Bridge 1: Birdman]
Yea, Number 1 in that field nigga
We out there shining and trappin
Just know it's real out there, so be real out there
Stacks on top of stacks
Bitches, whips, floss, gettin in puttin it in nigga

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Swerve on a hater like, "fuck your life"
Just out of spite, if that's your girl then I'mma fuck her twice
We ain't from here, if you ain't known better tuck your ice
I'll put a brick on your head, consider that your price
If its about money, you can count me in
I'll turn 50 to 100 before you can count to 10
End up missing fuckin with Millz, never found again
Rappers thinks they nice
Congrats, they must have found my pen
Shit is real I take it to the heart now
I never gave a fuck so why start now?
You boys goldfish, swimming with the sharks now
Fuck what you drive, just know you will get parked now
Millzy in this bitch, and now i'm on the top now
I used to want the streets, got those I want the charts now
What I rap I live it, What I make I flip it
Money stand tall as Roy Hibbert hater forget it
Young Money!

[Bridge 2: Birdman]
Yea, where I from nigga even killas get killed
Just the life boy, the bigger the nigga the bigger the bullet
But at the end of the day its all about that money nigga
Ball baby ball, you understand me?
From 100 to 1000 nigga yea from a mill to these mills man

[Verse 3: Flow]
Okay, them birds fly high but we get them bitches cheap
Table full of coke who say two mountains never meet
Glock 23 and a chopper with a stock lift
Bandanna tied 'round my head on my Pac shit
Watch em run and yell bitch nigga tuck your tail
Click-Clack (BAH! BAH!) throw the Glock in the canal
You know young'n keep it real so you gotta respect him
All my niggas kill for me they so overprotective
And what's up with these rappers I ain't feeling these niggas
Had a talk with Birdman he told me "kill these lil bitches"
Man they can't fuck wit me
I hope they second guess
Nigga you ain't raw
Like dope that's re compressed
I'll kick in your fuckin door everybody in your house die
You better stay in line
Or chalk you out, now you outlined
Try to show his ass, fucked around and got assed out
Rich Gang bitch but I do this for the have-nots

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
Uh, man fuck these niggas
When I strike i'm sparing everything but these niggas
Got a fresh pair of jays
All gold shades
Rapping like the boss, lookin and i'm tryna get a raise
But bitch i'm the boss so a nigga gettin paid
Customized life, I got it made
Boy you know my chicks is like speakers
12's and 15's with mad rump in the trunk if you know what I mean (Ha)
Fuck twitter nigga in real life nobody follows ya
Ya momma should've swallowed ya
Ya daddy ain't proud of ya
Them niggas that you with ain't got ya back ya crew frontin
Bunch of pump fakers acting like they gon' shoot somethin
The coupe that I copped the other day was 2 somethin
If I mash on the gas that bitch go bout 2 somethin
Young Mack my driver but i'm Captain Phillips niggas
I'm in the water like a pirate
You gassed i'm a hybrid
Uh, i get cougars in my granddaddy shirt
And get my weed off my family tree that's granddaddy purp
You get found under the? in the trunk by the bazooka
I'm on the side of the road just like a state trooper
I run up in your castle, steal your princess King Koopa
Better have some weed in that bitch if you pass me that hookah
I need the cover of the Forbes before i leave my corpse
Streets say that i'm abusive, I always whip the Porsche
You ain't in the streets you just jumped off the porch
You's a sidewalk nigga
For that side talk nigga
I'll barbecue your ribs when the fire spark nigga
And tonight i'm in the six i left the five parked nigga
I smoke that Tokyo until a nigga look Asian
Bitch I ball hard
Sugar-Slim my sports agent
Young Paul George
I'm Indiana Pacing
Surging with that yappa i'll give ya ass a facelift
We the ones to fear though
Strong like the Chapperos
Allergic to normal, certified weirdos
Niggas online be like " FUCK YOU! " I be like ditto
I'm coolin puffing good with lil izo at the cribbo
Hungry Hungry Hippo
Don't cha' be greedy
I get rich with my rich gang and give to the needy
With Mack in the building pimps retire or get fired
It's Young Money the Rise of a fucking Empire
I'm Gone

[Outro: Birdman]
Yea, you understand me?
Lil Young Money killers
Cash Money gangstas
Slice a nigga up and put em in the freezer
Big money over here boy, you understand me?

Yea, holla at me boy
Fresher Than Ever nigga x3
