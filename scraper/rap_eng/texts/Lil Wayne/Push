[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Fly boy, yeah right, hehe
Hey mamma, they call me Weezy
And you should be with me, I got a pocket full of reasons
Baby, I could bless you when you ain't even sneezing
I'll be at your rescue when you don't even need me
I could have you dreaming when you ain't even sleepy
Mamma, I could help you get off, like the weekend
She said she wanna do it to the new Enrique
I pop the disc in and put the song on replay
And then she backed it up like replay
Hehehe

[Verse 2: Enrique Iglesias] (Lil Wayne)
When you're near me..
Girl, I try to hide it, but I can't escape it
Oh baby
Please forgive me
When I think of you, my thoughts are so X-rated (Gotta forgive me, baby)
Oh baby..
Baby, I don't give a damn
I know that your man's nowhere in sight, whoa-whoa
And your eyes don't tell a lie
I know you wanna come with me, tonight
And I say alright, but first you gotta

[Hook]
Push, push, back up on me (GiiiiRRRRL)
Make me believe you want it
Push, push, back up on me (GiiiRRRRL)
Girl, I can't go home lonely
Push, push, back up on me (GiiiRRRRL)
Go ahead, lay it on me
Don't stop until the morning (GiiiRRRL)
Just keep pushing back on me

Do you need me? - (You know it!)
Will you please me? - (You know it)
Will you tease me? - (You know it!)

[Verse 3] (Lil Wayne)
Baby, I (Let's go)
I'm the kinda guy that don't get real excited (Yea!)
Oh baby
When you have (Yeah)
When you have your private party, I hope that I'm invited
(Yep) Oh baby
Baby, I don't give a damn
I know that your man's nowhere in sight
(Whatcha man gotta do wit me? Tell me!)
And your eyes don't tell a lie
I know you wanna come with me, tonight
And I say alright (well, let's go!), but first you gotta

[Hook: w/ Lil Wayne ad-libs]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne - Rap]
Okay, so after you back it up, just stop
Now drop it like it's hot, and pop it like a Glock
And sto it like a watch, now move it like clockwork
Ya body is screamin and ya booty is an outburst
She wanna do it, do it with no delay
I told her I could run it, run it just like relay
Yeah, cause I'm cool, just like the breeze way
And +Push It+ like Salt-N-P-E-P-P-A

[Hook: 2X w/ Lil Wayne ad-libs again]
