(Yeah, uh-huh)
(Yeah-eh)

[Hook: Baby E.]
I've been trappin out the bando
Chillin' with my grandma
Grew up down in Florida
Raised me in the N.O
Said they raised me in the N.O, yeah

[Verse: Baby E.]
Shout out to my day-ones
And the place I came from
Living in the hills now
Used to be a trailer
Me and all my homies
We done came a long way
Copper catchin' cases just for tryna steal bologna
Baby E., the prodigy
AKA the greatest
Fuck 'em if he hate
I'm the peoples' favorite
Had to take the negative
Turn into a positive
Now I'm doing everything they probably never thought I could, yeah

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Nothing's ever easy (no)
Was on the outside looking in with a squeegee (oh)
Then I got the game from Juvie, Turk and B.G. (woah)
I went from wearing C-Z's to yelling "bling-bling!"
Lord I remember when the birds was just "Tweety"
Hoes was wearing BEBE, not BC-BG
Lord I remember when these hoes wasn't so freaky
Yes I remember when these hoes was being cheeky
But now they tweakin' for a nigga, I'm a rockstar
I like my red carpet redder than my eyeballs
She got that pep in her step, I knock her socks off
Then to the left, to the left, like a southpaw
And I keep dozing off on her, off the codeine
She said I need to stop, bitch, guess who I don't need
The drophead cost me a duffel bag of hundreds
It's my way or the highway, and I see traffic coming (skrr)
And my homies got more white than abercrombie
So baby knock yourself out she started shadowboxing
And my homies wear all black, act like they gothic
And these hoes act like they topics, bitch we talk 'bout profits

[Hook: Baby E.]
I've been trappin out the bando
Chillin' with my grandma
Grew up down in Florida
Raised me in the N.O
Say they raised me in the N.O, yeah

[Verse: Hoody Baby]
Bitch, I'm the man
Bitches used to call me manage
With that white girl, disappear, Vanish
Sell a whole thing for 32 like magic
Pull up with the plug, bitches think I speak Spanish
I remember back when a nigga never had shit
Just a bad bitch, 3 pounds, and a mattress
She ran off with the work, so it's like I never had shit
I can't even lie, I could have killed that bitch
Had to make a choice, she want the money or the hoes, my nigga
Coke prices up and down like gold, my nigga
Rockin' shows, my nigga
Rockin' O's, my nigga
In the Double-R on this rocky road, my nigga

[Hook: Baby E.]
Trappin out the bando (Young Moolah, baby!)
Chillin' with my grandma
Grew up down in Florida
Raised me in the end though
Say they raised me in the end though, yeah

[Verse: Baby E.]
Shout out to my day-ones
And the place I came from
Living in the hills now
