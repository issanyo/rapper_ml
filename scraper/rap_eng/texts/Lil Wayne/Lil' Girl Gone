[Tony Mack - adlibbing]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I'm talking 'bout a good girl gone bad
Crooked world, wrong pad
Right mom, wrong dad
I sing this song mad, but not mad enough to shoot you
But, it just eats me up like some barbeque from Luther's
In the morning with the boosters, on the corner with the boosters
And she's the fresh-cut, and they're on her like sutures
And I wanna talk to her, but her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better, she's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby, you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain
Trust me, I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an oncoming train
Stuck in the passenger seat, trying do the fast lane
Damn!

[Hook 2x's: Devin The Dude]
Little girl gone somewhere, out there stranded
Can't nobody find her and they don't understand it
She was raised good, can't blame her parents
Lost in the sauce is not the way they planned it

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well, once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two-story house, two-car garage
And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard
See, daddy was a doctor and mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced, so now mommy's a dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit, now he's a snorter
And all this shit is taking place right in front of their daughter
She says, "Daddy, what's wrong?"
But, he's just too high
"Mommy, what we gon' do?"
She just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right
Looking for answers alone, in the darkness of night
Shit ain't tight!

Little girl gone somewhere, out there stranded
Can't nobody find her and they don't understand it
She was raised good, can't blame her parents
Lost in the sauce is not the way they planned it

[Verse 3: Devin The Dude]
Couldn't even fold her own clothes yet, she chose to jet
Some shit that she will always regret
Now she's runnin' from house to house, out and about
All hours of the night, learnin' hard lessons of life
She called home twice, but she couldn't say
Where she was gonna' lay her head the very next day
She gave up her body and mind, way before time
Got nothin' left to dug out, to get help

[Verse 4: Tony Mack]
She doesn't know what to do with herself
Her family's worried, think she don't even care
Don't even care!
She's livin' a rough life on a hope and a prayer
Where she'll end up in a few years, who knows where
Who knows where!

Can't nobody find her and they don't understand it
(Don't understand it)
She was raised good, can't blame her parents
(Heyyyyy!!)
Lost in the sauce is not the way they planned it
