[Chorus]
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom

[Intro – J.R. Writer]
Uhh, 1 2, Writer, Dipset writers block nigga
I’m back, but I ain’t by myself
I brought a few friends along
Pulled up in something nice too
220 on the dash by the way

[Chorus]
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom
We like the cars, we-we-we like the cars
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom

[Verse 1 – J.R. Writer]
Uhh, I get cheese, whip sprees, big D’s
But it ain’t Bentley, it’s a Bugatti, with a parle
On my off day, it’s a ducatti
I don’t move sloppy, I’m a known goon
And my trunk ain’t the only thing that go boom
Get a pro room
This is big cash, my whip so fast, I get whiplash
When I skid past, with the rip rags
So much rides I got my own six flags, damn!
You want sick I can tell boy
But my doors lift like they on steroids
When I ever get to rode through the peas
They be jealous as a hoe cus I bees
No top exposed in the V (matter the fact)
Tell Jerry Springer to throw me some beads

[Chorus]
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom
We like the cars, we-we-we like the cars
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom

[Verse 2 – Lil Wayne]
Yea, uh um, call me two-seat Tune
No speakers but I keep that boom
Tell the car salesman I’ll be back soon
Bought a truck for the night and a drop for the noon
Pull up at the light pull the top back smooth
Push one button and everything moves
Push my button and everyone shoot
And I got one word for the cops, vroom
J.R and BMJR
Only like weed and bitches in they car
Television screen and systems in they car
And my whip posed topless like for playboy haha
I ridin’ down your family street
Knock your portrait off your mantle piece
Ha I’m probably listening to Coldplay or that old Jay ya

[Chorus]
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom
We like the cars, we-we-we like the cars
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom
