(Verse 1)
Ahh
This time Ima give you the truth
The truth and nothin but the truth
So help me God,now bring it on come on
You little suckas, bring home my brass knuckles and beat the odds?
Keep me high baby keep me hot
Gravity has been re-defined
Saw you in my concert waiting in line
I was on my tour bus taking my time
Then I hit the stage after that I got paid
Then I hit the presidential suite and got laid
Women in the thub everytime y bathe behind my shades

(chorus)
And Take my pictureee
And hang it up against your wall,wall,wallll
Find me on top of your sisteeeer
???
For the most wanted rockstarrr
The most wanted rockstar
The most wanted, the most wanted rockstar

(Verse 2)
Im so at ease, no enemies, Please
You hate me but do you know that im a killa
An alien tell ?em suck my antennas
Ima mothafuckin winner, eat losers for dinner
She can be my fairy, she can be my fuckin adversary
But if she talk she gon? have to get buried

Looked in the mirror ???
Shut up and ride bitch!

(Chorus)
Take my pictureee
And hang it up against your wall,wall,wallll
Find me on top of your sisteeeer
???
For the most wanted rockstar
The most wanted rockstar
The most wanted, the most wanted rockstar

(Verse 3)
My girls? Are black and so is my car

Your girlfriend says she wanna go in my droughts
I got the bitch naked moan in my ???
Even though im not home

But I should lower my tone cuz im still the most wanted

(Chorus)
And Take my pictureee
And hang it up against your wall,wall,wallll
Find me on top of your sisteeeer
