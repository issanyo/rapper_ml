[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
See me, I'm focused man
But my girl don gon' snappy
Stuntin' like her daddy
Vroom on the Yamaha
She ride me like a Kawasaki
I call her lil buddy
Sometimes I call her shawty
She only wears dresses
She sleep in Ed Hardy
Ya digg hah
It's Young Weezy the 80's baby
And we can get together, make 80 babies
Now the house brand new
The car brand new
But your still the same old you

[Chorus - RL]
I want a girl like her
That'll stay down for me
Everything that I need
That'll put me first
Here for better or worse
I wanna a girl like her
Somebody that'll look like her
Somebody that can cook like her
Sex is off the hook like her
On everything I need a girl like her

[Verse 2 - RL]
I need somebody that'll always send my bag
Somebody that'll keep me on track
When I feel the weight of the world on me
I need somebody like this
She gotta handle her business
Know how to hold my interest
Be there in an instant
I'm looking for you

[Chorus - RL]
I want a girl like her
That'll stay down for me
Everything that I need
That'll put me first
Here for better or worse
I wanna a girl like her
Somebody that'll look like her
Somebody that can cook like her
Sex is off the hook like her
On everything I need a girl like her

[Verse 3 - RL]
She's gotta have her head on straight

My escape from the every day
Things to deal with
Someone to chill with
I can build with
Something real with
Not that everyday in the club
Need more than the average one
Something special
Extra exceptional
Freaky sexual

[Chorus - RL]
I want a girl like her
That'll stay down for me
Everything that I need
That'll put me first
Here for better or worse
I wanna a girl like her
Somebody that'll look like her
Somebody that can cook like her
Sex is off the hook like her
On everything I need a girl like her

[Bridge - RL]
If you get your own money
If you got your own crib
If you got good credit
And you handle your biz
Sing along with this
Talking to you
Uh

[Chorus - RL]
I want a girl like her
That'll stay down for me
Everything that I need
That'll put me first
Here for better or worse
I wanna a girl like her
Somebody that'll look like her
Somebody that can cook like her
Sex is off the hook like her
On everything I need a girl like her

[Outro - RL]
Talking to you
I'm looking for somebody like her
Could you be her?
Could you be her?
Yeah
