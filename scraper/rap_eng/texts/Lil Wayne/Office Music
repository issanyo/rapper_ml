Baden ape, Yves Saint, Evisu iz wat I stand
Got me feelin' like scarface, like da Koheba
Streets reply I look right in da 4 seater
You know I be out here ridin da 4 seater
Top floor of the 4 Seasons four of them whores
And they all know how to cook it up
And look I got some
And only one know how to bag, bitch bundle up
See its a cold world so homey bundle up
We ain't on dis grind for nothin
Now get ya hustle up
