[Intro]
New chapter, move on, look back for what?

[Verse 1]
Ain't afraid to die, I done done it already
All that money on your mind I done spun it already
I was hustlin' already, I was fuckin' already, yeah
Pussy, money, weed was the subject already
See I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it
For my woes, for my city, for my hoes, for my critics
See its TTG, trained to go, time to grind, no more CMB
Excuse my French, but you know where you can mwah, yeah
Excuse my Spanish, but its no más
I been working hard for no prize
But I'm still grateful though I show pride
And you don't see Stunna right next to me
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me
They can't put no more Weezy Baby out
That's that Cash Money vasectomy
I still got love for my enemy
Cause I know its tough to be interesting
I know its tough to be anything, but be grateful

[Hook]
Ain't afraid to die, I done it already, yeah
TTG, trained to go, time to get it, yeah
I ain't afraid to die, I done it already, yeah
I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it, yeah
And you don't see Stunna right next to me
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me
You don't see Stunna right next to me
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me
And I still got love for my enemy
Cause I know it's tough to be interesting
I know its tough to be anything but a hater
Fuck later, I want mine now
Fuck later, you done fucked up now, see you later
You fucked up now, oh baby

[Verse 2]
You are witnessing, the bomeback
Yeah, put your money where your fucking mouth at, yeah
I pull up on em bumping Keith Sweat
Them niggas never see me sweat
And tell the press I'm not depressed, I just had to press reset
I just had to get me set, and I'm not playin' skip recess
I'm a different Weezy, and I'm drippin' Fiji
In a Lamborghini with the seats wet
Hardest lesson is regret
Snorting powder on the P jet
Ask the pilot are we there yet
He said we on the ground, and we ain't leave yet
Had to step back and take a deep breath
It's hard as heck to show 'em respect
I love 'em to death but they ain't dead yet
Don't know how long I'm able to repeat that
Me I'm just tryin' to see the bread stretch
These niggas tryna see dread stress
Me, I'm just tryin' to see the dead rest
And I can't rest if I ain't pray yet

[Interlude]
Father forgive them for their wrongdoings
For they do not know what they are doing, Amen

[Hook]
Ain't afraid to die, I done it already, yeah
TTG, trained to go, time to get it
Bitch I ain't afraid to die, I done done it already
TTG, trained to go, time to get it
You don't see Stunna right next to me
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me
You don't see Stunna right next to me
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me
And I still got love for my enemy
Cause I know its tough to be interesting
Cause I know its tough to be anything, but be grateful

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Can't lie we blessed, safe deposit box where I hide the check
Wear a hockey jersey just to hide the vest
I talked to God he deny the stress
I make women cry when they next to me
They say they blessed to be next to me
Give my kids my heart, put my mind in my music
And I let them hoes get the rest of me
Can't let this cold world get the best of me
Got the recipe for my destiny
Yeah I want them mills like Stephanie
Want the blue face hundreds preferably
This is the bounce back this is God's work
This is hard work, this is our work
This is all night graveyard work
Man this beat is godly
So I'm takin' off like a screechin' Harley
Watch the women wave cause I'm freakin' gnarly
Percs and purp got me sleepin' calmly
So I wake up and I chase the check
'Cause we ain't promised life, but we promised death
But we gon win, and I promise that
Young Money Records, you should honor that
And my vicious city got respect for me
Got killas to get at yo neck for me
You get the best of me, until the death of me
And the second me gon be the better me
Be grateful

[Hook]
Ain't afraid to die, I done it already
All that money on your mind I done done it already
I was hustlin' already, I was fuckin' already
Pussy money weed was the subject already
See I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it
For my woes, for my city, for my hoes, for my critics
See its TTG, time to grind, no more CMB
Excuse my French, but you know where you can mwah, yeah
Excuse my Spanish but its no más
I been working hard for no prize
I'm still grateful though I show pride
You don't see Stunna right next to me
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me
I still got love for my enemy, cause I know its interesting
I know its tough to be anything  but be grateful
Fuck later, I want mine now
Fuck later,  fuck them now see you later
Fuck them, oh baby
