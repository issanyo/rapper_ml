Uhm, blacka blacka
Lose a backer, you should back up
Blucka blucka, you should suffer
Lose a mother, motherfucker your mother
Fuck your brother, that fucker died like John Tucker
I'm ruckus, I'm ill, no for real
I'm the only stingray in the water that kills
A bad pill, y'all sweeter than Advils
While I sit on your girl bread like her last meal
I blew up before I grew up
Got introduced to the game, now I'm at they heads like crew cuts
Suit up and lace your boots up
It's war time
It's Weezy Baby, no crime, no lyin'
Y'all motherfuckers slipping, you better hold on
I think they tripping like Cedric and Solange
I flow like I'm headless, no mind
I can say don't rhyme and it's gonna rhyme
