{Verse 1]

My bitches call me Jack, my dick like a beanstalk
Don't look down, YM we on top
Excuse my French, pop that pussy don't stop
We poppin' bottles, supermodels poppin' pussy
Bitch niggas, they just need to get some pussy
I'm on the edge, Grand Canyon, don't push me
Weezy so you niggas can't breathe, you're now in tune with Tunechi
I get pussy like a dildo, to these ratchets I'm Harry Styles
All my chicks like Rihanna, they got a lot of styles
I run laps round niggas, check the Air Miles
I'm feelin' like Snoop, tell her bend it over, Doggystyle
Yeah, still' eatin' off 2001 drug money
Never a gang banger, but I always went after that Blood money
Can never have a enough money, I dodge niggas like Wesley
Flood that pussy like a levee, go deep in that pussy like Chevy
I got bars like San Quentin, bitch this shit heavy

[Hook]

We grindin' out here, tryna get that new money
I'm doin' my thang, get you money
Feedin' all my niggas, that's that crew money

[Verse 2]

I tell a bitch don't stop, y'all niggas is stop signs
I'm getin' laid, y'all just lying, through you teeth
Evening meal, got that pussy in my teeth, yeah
Take it and kill it like this beat, ha
You niggas gassed up like Chevron, my Miami niggas got heat
Young Money genereal, don't fuck with the Navy
She ready to tapout, Muhammad Ali
She pop that pussy like a muthafuckin' ollie
She give me wood, I think her name was Holly
She screaming, I beat that pussy up like Rocky, excuse me if I'm cocky
She in love with my dick, get knocked out if you wanna knock me
She make it stand, but it ain't funny
My dick long, but not as long as my money
100 milli in the bank, so much head I'm ahead of the game
Red Nation nigga, shout out to The Game
She clappin' that ass, get clapped if you wanna fuck with me

[Hook]

We grindin' out here, tryna get that new money
I'm doin' my thang, get you money
Feedin' all my niggas, that's that crew money

[Verse 3]

Life's no bitch, it's a dick with it's up and downs
Gettin' all these bitches, better stop fuckin' round
To these niggas I'ma dead end, they see me and turn around
In and out o the cage, Feds think we animals cause we wildin' out
You'sa red nose nigga, look who's laughin' now
Livivn' ghetto dreams, but sometimes it's a nightmare bein' Lil Wayne
Got a long Uzi and I carry it all day, bitch please
I'm a skater, got tricks up my sleeve
Got a bitch that look like Beyonce, all night she sayin' my name
Say my name, but never say it in vain
I'll pop your arteries, fuck niggas, I told y'all not to fuck with me
Rich Gang and we livin' fast, you better keep up
Money talks, these niggas better speak up
Weezy F for fuck you, that goes out to the fake niggas
I'mma Hot Boy, got that fire, you ain't gon' put me out nigga
Cash Money, that's my fam nigga

[Hook]

We grindin' out here, tryna get that new money
I'm doin' my thang, get you money
Feedin' all my niggas, that's that crew money
