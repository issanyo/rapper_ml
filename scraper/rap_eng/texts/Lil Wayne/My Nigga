[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I'd die for my motherfuckin' nigga
Jump in front of a bullet for my motherfuckin' nigga
On the stand I'd lie for my motherfuckin' nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfuckin' nigga
Real talk, I don't really fuck with too many niggas
Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels
I be laughin' to the bank like the fuckin' money tickle
Drivin' something that you ain't, top off, suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro, don't beef over no ho
And my niggas sell them keys if you can't open your door
Hope you ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
When it rains it pours, it's dry for me and my fuckin' niggas
I kill for my motherfuckin' niggas, vice versa
Eyes red from the kush I blew, white person
Got my middle finger on the trigger
And with my little finger to you niggas
I swear it's fuck all y'all niggas
Except my niggas

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan & Lil Wayne]
I said that I'mma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My motherfuckin' niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
