Back the hell off
Rock n roll Jesus with all my nails on
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond
And give these blind motherf*ckers something to feel on
Rollin like a motherf*cker put your wheels on
And let's roll down and heal till the heal gone
I started on the block but that something to build on
And how can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on
Hey
The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which crowd I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone
Son look up
Father just shook us
Never was around like bush is
War just came like Kane with bishop
Movies too different to act not used ta
Boys in the hood messed up
No blueprints they just do it
Then they get commercial shootin
Ruthless, live your T.I. or lose it
Stupid people like ya'll once knew 'em
Who da, new nigga is show and prove it
Never skateboard but I grinds in these Supras
Ya'll niggas foolin, for fame and the fortune
Super human, 430 flame horses
Ready to use it, L.A. to Jerusalem
Betty Bootin, my girls fake Hollywood tits
Couldn't fool 'em, I just pull up
And I hold her, yeah, and adjust, to the mood
Jump-Jump out a window
Let's-Let's-Let's jump off a building baby
Let's Jump-Jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby
Jump-Jump out a window
Let's-Let's-Let's jump off a building baby
Let's Jump-Jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby
Hey
The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which crowd I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone
I know a girl named Crystal her last name Paul
I look into her eyes and I can see it all
I see it when she cry, I'm there when she call
Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall
Kill 'em all, die in the spirit of the war
Thinkin would a mind be in spiritual fall
My lyric will leave you in physical awe
Miserable, pitiful, ridicule, typical
Chemicals swimming through the inner tube
Get in you, that be the end of you
Times are beginnin new
F*ck what you done this about what I'm finna do
Motherf*ck a 9 to 5
I rather do 10 to 2
Motha f*cker pin a guy now I write a pinnacle
The government is saints and it's f*ckin identical
Kiss my ass, and suck my genitals, tabernacle, biatch!
Jump-Jump-Jump out a window
Let's-Let's-Let's jump off a building baby
Let's Jump-Jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby
Hey
The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which crowd I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone
Let's-Let's-Let's jump off a building baby
Let's Jump-Jump out a window-window
Let's jump off a building babyyy
