I'm just a rocker dude
Lookin for my rocker girl
Baby I'll rock your boat
Rock your bed, and rock your world
But gotta be as fly as me, me
You gotta know how to rock your stuff, stuff
VH1 Bret Michel's, Be my rock of love
Be as one, big stones
Lemme rock you up
Maybe marriage, baby carriage
Lemme knock you up
I could be your rocker daddy
You could be my rocker mommy
I could your chilly pepper
You could be my hot tamale
Have your ever made to a rockstar
In a hot car with the top off
In the middle of a parkin lot
You don't care who see, who look, or who watch ya
Pretty face
And the body soft as baby skin
She hopped on me and rode
I thought my name was Harley Davidson
You got your tattoos
I got my tattoos too
We stayin all night and do what rockstars do
We got the music
Bumpin thru the system
The room is real smoky
Highlights in a mansion
You loving all day
You sleeping all night
We up and hit the mall
Sweats cus you on bait
Try and imitate us
But could never duplicate us
Pull up in the Ferrari
Saying hello to all my haters
Have you ever mad love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. mad. love
You drive a fast car
I drive a fast car too
Suicide doors with the topless roof
Now were cursin
Glasses on the face
Cus he ducking paparazzi, they high speed chasin
We gotta mazaretti but we driven in a range
Cus we don't give a damn
Switch rides by the day, day, day
Now this is what I call rockstar love
This was the question I was thinkin of
Have you ever mad love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. mad. love
I'm a R.O.C.K star
And I can play
Like I play my guitar
Call me Weezy F. the best you ever saw
She the best you never saw
Cudnt even loook at me
Got a chauffeur
But he ain't even look me
In the back seat poppin like fried chicken cookin
And in tied to the
Like eyes on bugizzy
Shawty got class
And no I won't play hooky
But no not never
Put my feet on the pedal
And make that guitar go medal like
Ya told your girl
I could play
I could play the guitar
