I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or will it end in tragedy

Fatal attraction ready for action
She had a body like Ms. Jackson
I knew there was trouble when she passed by
But she was so fly
She invited me over
So I hopped in the Rover
Then my lady called the phone
And I should of went home
But I let the phone roam

And it was like
Oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's was like
Oh
I can't keep my hands to myself

I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or will it end in tragedy

I swear that I was done
I'm never going back
Then she called me up
She said I left my hat
You know I can't live without my hat
I got an excuse double back y'all
So you know I'm gonna have a ball
I said I'm going back y'all
Believe me that's not all

And now I'm like
Oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's like
Oh (Young Money)
I can't keep my hands to myself

I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or let it end in tragedy

Uh, I got a main bitch and a mistress
I'm trying to work it out, I'm on my fitness
Probably won't last, but I'm optimistic
One makes me happy, the other one makes a difference
I ain't a player, but I love a lot
She loves me, she loves me not
But it feel good, and it's not supposed to
I eat her insides, mm soul food
She put her head back, then her eyes close
We stuck in the moment like the time froze
Then my girl call, back to reality
But I keep her in a picture in my heart gallery, oh!

Oh (Yeah)
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's like
Oh
I can't keep my hands to myself

I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or let it end in tragedy
