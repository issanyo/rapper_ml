[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She so good for me
Mr. good stuff, Mrs. good stuffin', good lovin'
Watch me pull up till I pull somethin' on a full stomach
Take her out to eat like I'm hungry if you're hungry
Hopin' it off, then droppin' her off
Then toppin' it off with a muah on her jaw
And a smack on the ass, and a call me tomorrow
And a walk to the door and a honk on the horn
Got Monica on my playlist and she on my bae list
But since I got a situation I use imagination, all right

[Hook: Monica]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, Tunechi
Ain't no one can take me from my baby
Like I can get my heart and all my time
Gotta keep my lovin' on your mind
Oh you got me goin' so find me
I can't control it

[Bridge: Monica]
Meant to be together through the times
Cause you're just right for me
Boy you know your love's the best
And it's just right for me
And I don't care about your past
Cause you're just right for me
Just right for me
And I don't care about your past
Cause you're just right for me
Just right for me

[Verse 2: Monica]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
It's like you're always tryna keep me happy
So you know what a wife like me gon do
Got me thanking on the two that made you
Oh you got me goin' so find me
I can't control it

[Bridge: Monica]
Meant to be together through the times
Cause you're just right for me
Boy you know your love's the best
And it's just right for me
And I don't care about your past
Cause you're just right for me

You know it
Oh, you got my attention
Boy you never lose, cause you know I miss it
The things we do, my king, you're my best friend

And it's just right for me
And I don't care about your past
Cause you're just right for me
Just right for me
Just right, my time
The only one in my eyes
Oh, youâ€™re just right for me
Just right for me
