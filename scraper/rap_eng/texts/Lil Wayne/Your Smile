Girl, why do you blow my mind?
I think about you all the time
Like an addict Iâ€™m so addicted to you (to you)

When I see you smile (When I see you smile)
Ooh, Drives me wild (Ooh, Drives me wild)
And I can't explain it (I can't explain it)
Oh it's killing me baby (killing me baby)

Eee-oh Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Oh

Like a desert before the rain
My existence feels so in vain
I shake n shiver when I hear your name girl (name girl name girl)
Wish we could run away (run away)
Maybe touch the stars float away
It was meant to be you and me
Baby lets kiss the sky

When I see you smile (When I see you smile)
Ooh, Drives me wild (Ooh, Drives me wild)
And I can't explain it (I can't explain it)
Oh it's killing me baby (killing me baby)

Eee-oh Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Eee-oh Oh
Eee-oh Oh

(I approached her like, I approached her like, approached her like)
Hello! Hi darlin' um excuse me pardon
I don't mean to bother
But I just hard ta
I mean I just had to say
I'm a Carter jus like Nino and Lil Valentino
And yea we hot but hell if we knew
Why do she go where ever we go?
How many people? cause there's just two of us
But the girls say, So what there's a few of us & they get on my tour bus & they know what to do with us
Girl your smile make a nigga like vowels
Got me like wow, got me thinking wow
Throw away the lifestyles
Got me thinking wife, child all for a smile
A smile you can see for a mile make her howl so loud she don't even make a sound wow!
And everytime she smiles I go wild, I'll be here for a while

When I see you smile (When I see you smile)
Ooh, Drives me wild (Ooh, Drives me wild)
And I can't explain it (I can't explain it)
