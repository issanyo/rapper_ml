[Lil' Wayne]
Le me freshen up
Ok
I just want to love every girl in the World
Take her to the moon, then take her to the room
Posted up chilling, looking how I?m feeling
Its Miss Amerie and Mr A Millie
Smelling like money, it?s probably Young Money
Usain Wayne, I make her run from me
Crew neck tee, all black chuckers
Weezy F B, the girls dem lover
And if it ain't me then the girls just suffer
I got the big bread so the girls just butter
And you ain't gotta love me cos the World do
And I ain't gotta do me cos ya girl do
Miss Amerie, took a lil time out
Bugatti sit so low you gotta climb out
Bring it back, bring it back
I blow your spine out
Hehe, get the handicap sign out

[Amerie]
I Done Heard Them All Talk ?Bout How Much They Want Me
But Ain?t Never Had Nobody Put It On Me
(Hey!) Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain?t Been Done To Me
Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain?t Been Done To Me

Some Of Them Wonder What It Takes To Be My Lover
First You Gotta Be My Drummer
Don?t Move Fast, You Can Pop Tags On The Louie Bag But It Won?t Get You Under My Covers

Ah Ah, Hoh Oh, Hey Aye, Hoh Yaye
Ah Ah, Hoh Oh, Hey Aye, Hoh Yaye

I Done Heard Them All Talk ?Bout How Much They Want Me
But Ain?t Never Had Nobody Put It On Me

(Hey) Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain?t Been Done To Me
Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain?t Been Done To Me

I Done Heard Them All Talk ?Bout How Much They Want Me
But Ain?t Never Had Nobody Put It On Me
(Hey) Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain?t Been Done To Me
Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain?t Been Done To Me

Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah (Keep It)
(Hey!)Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain?t Been Done To Me
(Hey!) Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain?t Been Done To Me
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah (Keep It)
(Hey) Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain?t Been Done To Me
(Hey) Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain?t Been Done To Me

You Asked Me To Let You Explain, I Done That
Same Talk, Same Game, Same Thang, I Done That
I Need A Kingston Feature
That?s Who Never Run When The Dance Floor Heat Up

[Chorus]
Sometimes I Want A Man To Make Me Feel
What I Really Need To Feel
But Do You Really Know What I Want This Time
But Sometimes I Want Him To Know What It Is
Cause Lately What I Been Getting Ain?t So Real, So Real, So Real

[Chorus]
[End]
