[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Pour it on the models
Shut up bitch, swallow

[Hook: Lil Wayne]x4
Shut up bitch, swallow
Shut up bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow
Shut up bitch, gargle (Ya Digg)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Look, I got one in the back
I got one in the front
I make em' do what I say
They tell me say what I wanna
I tell her, get your money girl and just start breathing
Cuz if it ain't about the dough, it ain't about me neither
See a gangster like myself I get that paper on women
Man yo women probably out there with some paper to give me
Listen, you're looking at a real pimp ask my old women
And they tell you no remote, I control women
I'm a whole load put me in the game woman
If he ain't paying, then he shouldn't be playing
I'm saying, broke dudes only make jokes funny
I make more than I can fit in this quote honey
Unquote comes sun soaked with Me Man
Fly you down here and lay you up in my beach house
And if you smile at my girl I'll make her smile back (x2)

[Hook: Lil Wayne]x7
Shut up bitch, swallow
Shut up Bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow
Shut up bitch, gargle (Ya Digg)
