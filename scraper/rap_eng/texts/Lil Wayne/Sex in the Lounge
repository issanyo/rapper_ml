I think I gave him a discrete name; he replied with a street name
P.R. at the heat game, no ball, repeat game
He addicted to hustle; I'm addicted to fame
Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chilling, make a hell of a killing
Don't I stunt on these bitches? Man I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em, when I'm done, I'm a don 'em
When we leaving the lounge, I'ma keep it a hundred
It went down, enough said, pull off in that thing, and it's blush red

Sex in the lounge, girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl, they gonna hear the sound
Of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this has happened to me, girl
Happened to me, girl oh why

So caught up in this girl
Shawty, got me hooked right now
Keeping true to myself, cause I'm so into her
Cause we doing it like nobody's around
And when we doing it, I can hear her make a sound
Shawty was singing like me
Had that girl singing, singing like me
She be like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh why

She looking at me like she want it
I'm over here
She climbing on top of me
I'ma make her scream, her scream

Sex in the lounge, girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl, they gonna hear the sound
Of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this has happened to me, girl
Happened to me, girl oh why

Sit that pussy on my bottom lip
Then, after that, you know we gotta switch
My house so big that bitch came with a lobby
We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday
I-I-I dig, I dig in that pussy, guess what I find
Tunechi Lee and Nicki, sex in the lounge

Sex in the lounge, girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl, they gonna hear the sound
Of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this has happened to me, girl
Happened to me, girl oh why

Sex in the lounge, girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl, they gonna hear the sound
Of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this has happened to me, girl
Happened to me, girl oh why
