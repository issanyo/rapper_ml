[Pre-Chorus: DJ Kay Slay]
I never seen nobody movin' like this
They don't want it with me now
They want my blood, they want my blood
Never seen nobody movin' like this
They don't want it with me now
They want my blood, they want my blood

[Chorus: DJ Kay Slay]
What you want from me? (Woo)
Such a tragedy (Woo)
They want my blood, they want my blood
They want my blood, they want my blood

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Mula, look
They want me dead, I want they names
They say I'm washed up 'cause I hide all these stains
But I hop on these tracks and I stop all these trains
And I hop off the plane, that's when I turn to rain
You got me on your mind, hope I die on your brain
But I'm speaking my mind, that's when I'm born again
And I lean to the side and pour out a lil' drank
'Cause we deep as the mobb, so let Prodigy drink
I got one check in mind, you know I want it blank
They say they want my blood, okay, I'll call a gang
I'm a be with my hive, we don't buzz 'cause we bang
Do more drugs than we slang, diamond studs in my fangs
And I'm Southern as Frank's, hospitality stinks
Change my name from Dwayne to just Rob
The banks, nine to five, no thanks, walk the line
And Flanks, that's my slime, Kay Slay and this verse was slain
Tunechi, amen

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Kay Slay]
I never seen nobody movin' like this
They don't want it with me now
They want my blood, they want my blood
I never seen nobody movin' like this
Because they don't want it with me now
They want my blood, they want my blood

[Chorus: DJ Kay Slay & Busta Rhymes]
What you want from me?
Such a tragedy (Woo)
They want my blood, they want my blood (You want my blood, don't you?)
They want my blood, they want my blood

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Look
It's the conglomerate bitch, get with the franchise, y'all
I'm past blessing niggas, now I'm about to baptize y'all, listen
You wanna sip the blood of a god while nibbling bread?
Communion, watching niggas fiend for the crack, but Reagan is dead now
Unfortunate for y'all, I was anointed to be
The one who possessed the blood of Musa and was appointed by me (Ha)
And make a statue of the kid mo'fucka, analyze my struggle
Barbaric with beatings, reorganize my muscle
Closin' traffic while leanin' up in a dome bubble
Vice and me don't panic with beef and struck you with brass knuckles
Bitch, you wan' challenge the chief?  Lay in your man's puddle of blood
I'm savage you weak (Hahaha), see, I demand trouble
They wanna put my blood in a capsule and lift they man's hustle
I'm quick to defend, a Glock'll make a giraffe buckle
I'm nice, fifth of Henny, then got the semi, pull off the muzzle (Rah)
Lay 'em down and then finish the nigga, toss the shovel (Uh)
I'm gonna put 'em on notice and form a strong huddle
I'll always move with a few of the iron men and bring a strong couple
Come for my blood if you want, nigga

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Kay Slay]
I never seen nobody movin' like this
They don't want it with me now
They want my blood, they want my blood
Never seen nobody movin' like this
They don't want it with me now
They want my blood, they want my blood

[Chorus: DJ Kay Slay]
What you want for me? (Woo)
Such a tragedy (Woo)
They want my blood, they want my blood
They want my blood, they want my blood
