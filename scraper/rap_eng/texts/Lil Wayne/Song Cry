[Lil' Wayne talking]
Letz go boy...clap ya hands...

[Chorus 2x]
Man, i make the bitches say...weezy make the hoes go..
And throw they W's up and say.....Young

[Verse 1]
If you know somebody hotta than me
You don't know shit
Little whizzle wee, bitch i'm focus man
See i got it slammed on the pokeys
Watch i make my top disappear..hocus pocus
Wait a minute...
I'm fucked up cause i can't get over somethin'
But is it me or is my Bentley super sick on them buttons
And i'm stunt'n in the dirty south
We bang out..if you think itz a game when them thangs all out
And i... aim at cha frame when them thangs drawn out
And i....rang at cha brain
I flip it when it come them flames
And maann..ain't it a shame
When ya names called out
Fee got u on the news wit cha remains all out
Ayy. ..the boy Wayne ball out
My paper bigger
I even got a few hundreds wit Franklin's baby pictures
I'm a it take there wit u

Weezy the official..S-Q-A-D
Yea...

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
I'm the son of the stunna baby
I stunts baby
I get it up it up front in lumps every month baby
I get enough cutz from slutz
So can u suck baby
I piss so much nut
I got bitches coughin' up babies
My Bentley my baby
I make her climb over humps
Wit her size 20 pumps baby
Ice chunks in my fronts when i grunts baby
And chickens cluck
I pluck for free
But all i want iz B
I leave blood over beats
Cause my heart speaks
I seek guns if i beef...beef beef son
If i beef 3 come
If i beef..gotta keep my heat tugged in the crease
Cause i reached my peak young in the streets
I thug in the streets
Hataz chew lead
Understand i got big boy bread
I leave crumbs you can eat
I leave tiger streaks
Where i spun in the streets
W-E-E-Z-Y WEE

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3]
People you are observin' 5 even honies
So look at me different
See me in the mean Lamborghini...look at me dimpin'
See me wit a queen on my wing....look at me pimpin'
Look at me wrong you dead.....wrong
The lead music to my ears
Make me pump it to ya headphones
Take a liter black, this nigga wit red bones
I gets my bread on
I'm 19 with them 20's, but i'm a 100% up in the red zone
I know the feds on
Every since i copped that house and them two Bentleys
The good is in me, the hood is in me
Thats why every other 16, i scream 17
I got bling heavily
Greasin' things glittery
Interbeam and get inbetween and u sleepin' in misery
Look at what the game did to me
Therez gangsta in every bit of me
FAT!!!

[Chorus 2x]
