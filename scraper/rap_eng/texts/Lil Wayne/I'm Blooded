[Intro]
Pi 'til I die
(Just because)
Pi 'til I die
Piru
Bs up
(Bitch, I'm me)

[Hook]
Young Money is the label
Let us in the door
Coming in this bitch
All red to the floor
And I'm Blooded
Soowoo
And I'm Blooded
Soowoo
I got Bloods on stage
Bloods at my shows
Fuck with my Bloods
Got blood on your clothes
And I'm Blooded
Soowoo
And I'm Blooded
Soowoo

[Verse 1]
Once again it's on
Yeah, I'm back in the booth
Stand at the top
Like a tack in the roof
Still on these hoes
Like a mack in a suit
Still on my toes
Not a crack in my shoe
Rappers talking 'bout me
But I don't give a hoot
These niggas still lying
I'm the motherfucking truth
Talk tough
'Til I knock off your kuf
And I own my team
I'm like a Maloof
They hating on me
I'm just trying to be Weezy
Just like Young Jeezy
In a lima bean 'Ghini
Smoked out my mind, baby
Now I'm seeing 3-D
Dope boy fresh
From my fitted to my DC's
All red
So these hoes know who we be's
(Bs up)
We be's Bloods, we Bs
Popeye flow
Y'all niggas Sweet Peas
Getting high on a yacht
Call it seaweed

[Hook]
Young Money is the label
Let us in the door
Coming in this bitch
All red to the floor
And I'm Blooded
Soowoo
And I'm Blooded
Soowoo
I got Bloods on stage
Bloods at my shows
Fuck with my Bloods
Got blood on your clothes
And I'm Blooded
Soowoo
And I'm Blooded
Soowoo

[Verse 2]
I advance my flow
And they must like that
They like it so much
They say they write that
Barking at the dog
But I don't bite back
I ain't CPR
I ain't bringing they life back
Black CBR
Bad bitch on the bike back
Skittles on my wrist
Yeah nigga, the bright pack
I'mma shine
I live where the light at
(Ya dig?)
Air Force fly
Call me a Nike check
Brand new coupe
Same color as the sky
The dash say two
Y'all know I'm gon' try
Cop pull me over
Y'all know I'm gon' lie
They go up in my trunk
Y'all know I'm gon' fry
Them niggas throwing salt
All over my fries
So I'mma just walk
All over them guys
Niggas throwing darts
Never hit the bullseye
Young Money, bitch
New Orleans, East Side

[Hook]
Young Money is the label
Let us in the door
Coming in this bitch
All red to the floor
And I'm Blooded
Soowoo

Soowoo
(Neck music)
I got Bloods on stage

Fuck with my Bloods
Got blood on your clothes
And I'm Blooded

[Verse 3]
Been around the world
Rep the same thang
Been around the world
It's the same gang
B's up, B's up, flame gang
Blaat, b-blaat, blaaa-blaaat, bang-bang
I told my homie Streets
"You can't sleep on life"
So he popped a X pill
And didn't sleep all night
I ain't worrying 'bout you
I'm just trying do me
Last album did two
I'm just trying do three
I am what every pair of eyes ought to see
Bitches wish they could just call and order me
My Momma used to tell me "Get a nine-to-five"
Cash Money made her say "Never mind, I'm fine"
(Bs up!)

[Hook]
Young Money is the label
Let us in the door

All red to the floor

Got blood on your clothes
And I'm Blooded
