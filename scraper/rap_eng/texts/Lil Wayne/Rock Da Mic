[Lil' Wayne talking]
Itz the SQAD, yea,  yea, itz the Sqad, ya know
Itz the Sqad, ya know, yea , yea

[Chorus]
Itz Weezy, ya know
And Raw Dizzy
U know who we iz

All of yall should sqad up ya'self
And if you don't like it you can fuck ya'self

[Raw Dizzy]
Itz feelz good when i'm after him
I'm young black azz slim
I'm click clat at him fo' practicin'
A brand new platnium whip, wit factories rims
Bitches never smack up them
They get they asses in
I'm dizzy, hot lyrics, i spit it
Nope, i'm not kiddin'
The boys hot-rific
You might see me ridin' in Tahoes
Flyin' wit models, sippin' on Heinkein bottles
Watchin' channels
Family thick like the Sopranos
Wit mo' bread than MacDonalds
In a whip fully dressed like systic primals
Like i'm a....u gotch yours..gotta have cheese like i'm nachos
I'm dizzy, the raw-diculous
Thatz the shit
Cause i been had what it takes to whip this bitch up
And..anyone who fucks wit Young Nut
Get a 12 gauge shotgun pump thru ya gutz
.yeeeaaa..

[Lil' Wayne]
Itz Weezy and his crew
The S-Q
And we know what to do
To go and get and get the loot
Yea..still watch how u goof around dude
Cause the dude still broom and move the whole room
Oohhh..

[Chorus 2x]

[Young Yo]
Yo, U know
Stupid hoe
No i ain't cha daddy bitch
Niggas sittin' in da caddy bitch
And you better have my dough when u get at me bitch
Young Y-O
The boy is back
Bitch like Too Short, i wuz born to mac
With the throwback jersey, wit the fitted to the back
20's on the coupe
Man i did it like that
(he did like that!!)
I'll do it again
Good pussy make paper
The dude a pimp
I'm a player to the heart
Gang to the head
Straight to the bed
Do it straight to the head
S - Q- A to the D till i'm dead
Been lookin' for a pimp, bitch holla at red
U heard whut i said
Know open up ya legz
And make Weezy money spread

[Chorus 2x]

[Lil' Wayne]
Big 20's on the whip look slick
Leather seats, tele-v's, extra keys
My brotha fee-fee probably out wit cha chick
And bring her home if her mouth game sick
Don't get me wrong
I'm the don of the click
A hotboy, i stand alone in this biaatchh
My Glock toy all chrome
Click...clicckk
Sqad wit a chick
Check my tires as i ride by ya quick
Check my air hole tech
Make me give ya azz a air hole neck
And we only fuck wit ya girl fo' that hoe neck
Guess what
Sqad up
Baby thatz so next
Cash Money, lil'whizzle
Off glass,  500 degreez
Young Money
Money Young is a team
And the money ain't as young as it seem
Dollaz comin'
S-Q..weezy
Holla..i'm comin'

[Chorus 2x]
