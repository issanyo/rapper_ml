[Chorus - Porcelain Black]
Hey hey hey if you're ready to rage
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like
Yeah yeah yeah, wearing leather and lace
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like

[Lil Wayne]
Umm, microphone check one, two
Yeah, yeah, it's Porcelain baby
And this is what Rock n Roll looks like

[Verse 1 - Porcelain Black]
The dark days falling down on my skin
I feel the thirst to get it in
Trouble, trouble, drink it down
Like a king, I'll take the crown
Flush away the pain til my head spins
Cause we're the kids that belong to the night
We gonna get pissed, we gonna start a fight

[Chorus - Porcelain Black]
Hey hey hey if you're ready to rage
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like
Yeah yeah yeah, wearing leather and lace
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like

Na-na-na-na-nana-na-nah
(Hey, hey, hey)
Na-na-na-na-nana-na-na-now, na-now
(Hey)
Na-na-na-na-nana-na-now
(Hey hey)
Na-na-na-na-nana-na-na-now, na-now
(Hey)

[Verse 2 - Porcelain Black]
We're putting dark shades on for the cameras
Take a picture now if you wanna have us
Lipstick smeared across my face
Not a drop will go to waste
Baby the beast is yours to chase
Cause we're the kids that belong to the night
We gonna get piss, we gonna start a fight

[Chorus - Porcelain Black]
Hey hey hey if you're ready to rage
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like
Yeah yeah yeah, wearing leather and lace
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like

Na-na-na-na-nana-na-nah
(Hey, hey, hey)
Na-na-na-na-nana-na-na-now, na-now
(Hey)
Na-na-na-na-nana-na-now
(Hey hey)
Na-na-na-na-nana-na-na-now, na-now
(Hey)

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
I-I-I-I need a cigarette and a bad bitch
Come be my soccer ball and get yo ass kicked
I like my pizza cold, I like my glass full
I don't like bullshit, but I like red bull
I smell like Guns and Roses
I look like money, bitch
I taste like Rock n Roll
I make her lick her lips
And all the drama's dead
I'm in the past life
I forgot her name but I remember last night
You can do what you do
I done did enough
I'm on that gangsta shit
I don't give a fuck
Weezy

[Porcelain Black]
You wanna talk the talk, get up and show me the walk
You wanna talk the talk, you better show me the walk
You wanna talk the talk, get up and show me the walk
You wanna talk the talk, you better show me the walk

[Chorus - Porcelain Black x2]
Hey hey hey if you're ready to rage
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like
Yeah yeah yeah, wearing leather and lace
Raise your hands up, this is what rock and roll looks like

Na-na-na-na-nana-na-nah
(Hey, hey, hey)
Na-na-na-na-nana-na-na-now, na-now
(Hey)
Na-na-na-na-nana-na-now
(Hey hey)
Na-na-na-na-nana-na-na-now, na-now
(Hey)
