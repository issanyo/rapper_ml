[Intro - Dre]
My nigga I think we got one, well, another one
Theres so much of these mo'fuckers, Weezy
Thats what they sayin when they play me and they hear me on the radio
Thats what they sayin to me
Thats what they sayin to me
Thats what they tellin

[Verse 1 - Dre]
When they Remy's in the system
Ain't no tellin' will I fuck em', will I diss em'
That's what they be yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Ya'll be chasin, and I replace em'.. huh?

[Interlude - Dre & (Lil Wayne)]
You don't need me for nothin' else, my nigga
Go get em'

(And I got em...)

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
When the Remy's in the system
Ain't no tellin on the spot where I'mma kiss em'
Thats why they be yelling I'm a Damu Blood
My Relation, Affiliation, soowoo nation
And since day one, I look forward to
Three, four, five bitches in my Porsche coupe
And yea, I be on that ass like a horse's shoe
If her religion is true, I'm 'bout to visit the moon
Is you coming?

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
Thats what they sayin when they play me and they hear me on the radio (Weezy you blow my mind)
Thats what they sayin to me
Thats what they sayin to me
Thats what they tellin me, yeah
Thats what they sayin when they play me and they hear me on the radio
Thats what they sayin to me..

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
When the Remy's in the system
Ain't no question, I'mma fuck em' and diss em
Leave em', never miss em'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Ya'll be chasin', I replace em', huh
Drunk off this, high on that
Man, I think the feds got my iPhone tapped
Ain't that a bitch? Well I hope her ass fat
And if it is I'mma smash that
And pass that back back in a daze
But back in the days I sold crack for a few days
Then quit after I got paid
I ain't lazy I just knew that there was more to be made
And I don't save money so I don't need a whore to be saved
I need a whore to be slaved, I need a whore to behave
I need a whore to be gay, what the fuck am I saying?
I don't need a ho for A thing, 'cuz I got more game than Beijing

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

[Bridge - Lil Wayne]
Tell em'
I'm talkin 'bout I'm gon' do what I do
And they gon' love me for what I do
And they gon' copy what I do
Yea
I'm talkin 'bout I'm gon' do what I do
And they gon' love me for what I do
And they gon' copy what I do
Yea

[REPEAT Verse 1 - Lil Wayne][x2]

[Outro]
Thats what they sayin'
Thats what they sayin' to me

Weezy you blow my mind

Young Moolah, baby
