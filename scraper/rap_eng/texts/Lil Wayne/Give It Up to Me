[Intro: Shakira & (Timbaland)]
(How you doing'? I'm Mr. Mos, I'm back)
Tim, are you on it?
Tim, are you on it?
Give me some
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted? Oh

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm, Wayne's world
I'm the cashier, I change girls
You can go up my crane, girl
And I'ma go down that drain, girl
Hey uh, midnight cowboy
My flow is a dog, down boy
Hah, and my girl is a queen
And she do what I say and I say what I mean (yeah)
Then I give it to her uncut
Shakira, swing them hips like nun chucks
Now, give it to me
I want the best and the best things in life are free

[Chorus: Shakira & (Lil Wayne)]
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me) Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)

[Verse 2: Shakira]
What you get is exactly what you give
Never really know until you try
We're so ahead of this
Got this she wolf appetite
That keeps me up all night
You know the way it works
Don't be afraid to ask
Aim high when the target is low
FYI, I am ready to go
People say men are just like kids
Never saw a kid behave like this
What you give is exactly what you receive
So put me in a cage and lock me away
And I'll play the games that you want me to play

[Chorus: Shakira & (Timbaland)]
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me) Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)

[Verse 3: Shakira & (Lil Wayne)]
Hey, can we go by walking
Or do you prefer to fly?
All of the roads are open
In your mind, in your life
(Give it up to me)
Hey, can we go by walking
Or do you prefer to fly?
All of the roads are open
In your life, in your life
(Give it up to me)

[Bridge: Timbaland]
Hey, lil' lady, what's your plan?
Say, lil' mama, come take a ride jump in
Hey, there, baby, what's on your mind?
Don't need approval tonight, tonight
Give it up

[Chorus: Shakira & (Lil Wayne)]
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me) Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me) You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me) Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
