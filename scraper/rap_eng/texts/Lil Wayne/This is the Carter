[Hook: Mannie Fresh]
Ladies and gentlemen, pimps and playas
Half-ass rappers and true rhyme sayers
This is the Carter, so hold onto your teenage daughter
Because this is the Carter, a lot more rich and a whole lot smarter
Wayne in ya brain, Young Carter
Wayne in ya brain, Young Carter

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Who am I? Young Wizzle for shizzle
Flow sicker than a third floor in hospitals
My charm Starburst, my watch Skittles
I'm hot sizzle, "what up, hot bizzle?"
Holla at a playa, I'm sorta like BD
Y'all can't stop my dribble, or block the lay-ups
Soft top the coupe, mami pop her too
Don't chase the feeling, baby girl, let it come to you
Remove the ceiling on the girl, now she comfortable
I'm a world-class G, mami, fuck wit dude
I got "La-Z-Boy bank": that's comfort loot
I'm a offensive coordinator, run and shoot
You watch your grill what you ought to do
Fore your ribs get barbecued
And my ribs is showing I say I'm starving dude
This, this, this, this, this is the Carter dude
What up Reel, c'mon

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm the Birdman, Birdman Jr. bitch
I be high in the sky, shit on you and your bitch
I be flyer than your guy you need to lose the prick
Now if you follow everything, just grab a wing
And we could shh
All the way down to the mall and bet I buy it all
Young Mar' picture the broad lick
All the way down to the balls then she wipe it off
If getting money is wrong I ain't right at all
I Young Money a car, I just write it off
I'm the boss of my own shit, I'm my own clique
I would say "fuck you", but go and get your own dick
Get your game up, boy, hustle harder
This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this
Get your game up, boy, hustle harder
This, this, this, this, this, this is the Carter

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
And y'all better blame Baby
Cause he's the muthafucka that made me, and I'm crazy!
And y'all ask why I never left the Navy
Cause he's the motherfucka that pay me, is you crazy?
Young, Young, Young Wizzle, baby
Give you your issue, Nina wanna kiss you
No, no, no, me no want no bullshit
So, so stop baller-blocking cause a nigga hood rich
And I floss every day because I could bitch
So holla at your boy cause I'm still on some hood shit
Like, like, like what's really good with your mom or your little boy
And your sister looking good, shit, shit
I'm still Apple Eagle Weezle
1-7 Hollygrove, never ever leave you
I got y'all waiting on my sequel
This, this, this, this, this, this is the Carter people
