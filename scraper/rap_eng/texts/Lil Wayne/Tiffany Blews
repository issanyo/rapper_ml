[Verse 1]
I'm not a crybaby, I'm the crybaby
A caterpillar that got stuck
Mr. Moth, come quick with any luck
A long walk to a dark house
A Roman candle heart keep us far apart
I'm cocktail party doing alright
Hate me baby
Maybe I'm a piece of art

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, my friends all lie and say
They only want the best wishes for me
Oh, 3-2-1 - we go live

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
And oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)

[Verse 2]
I can make your heart slow
I can feel the weather in my bones
Wish hard enough, I can turn it to what I like
Your pupils (big) big (roll)
They're rolling like dice

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They say they only want the best wishes for me
(They only want the best for me)
Oh, 3-2-1 - we go live

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
And oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Not the boy I was
The boy I am is just venting, venting
Dear gravity
You held me down in this starless city
Not the boy I was
The boy I am is just venting, venting
Dear gravity
You held me down in this starless city

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They say they only want the best wishes for me
(They only want the best for me)
Oh, 3-2-1 - we go live

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
And oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
