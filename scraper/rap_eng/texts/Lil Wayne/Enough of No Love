Ayy
(Young Mula baby, yeah)
Yâ€™all ready?

[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
I admit that you almost had me
I admit I was almost crazy
Had me thinkin' 'bout callin' that bitch at night
And let her know where she can come and meet me
But it's cool, I'mma be a lady
She thinks she cute but she don't phase me
And if you knew about all of this good love you'll be missin' out on
You wouldn't have played me

[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Can't say I'm not hurt
I'll be damned if I'm broken
What we had is now hers
Let her know she can have it

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Cause I-I can't stay here
If there's no love
Yeah I-I can't stay here
Cause I've had enough
Enough of no love, enough of no love
No love!

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole]
And I admit that I thought about creeping
So you could get a dose of how I feel
Cause our hearts can never seem to break even
But what's the use I'd rather pack it up and leave it
Cause here we are again, cause you're wrong again
You're tryin' to tell me that you love me
Cause your actions say another thing

[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Can't say I'm not hurt
I'll be damned if I'm broken
What we had is now hers
Let her know she can have it

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Cause I-I can't stay here
If there's no love
I-I can't stay here
Cause I've had enough
Enough of no love, enough of no love

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, hm, uh
Why you worry 'bout that other ho
Cause that other ho ain't worry 'bout another ho
Yeah, you say it's over but you still fussing
You just clumsy, always tripping over nothing
That other bitch is just that other bitch
I give her space and give you the mother ship
We can't let her tear down what we built
I told you if you ride or die then I'll be your seat-belt
In sickness and in health for rich poor and I stay rich
But love is a bitch and bitches ain't shit
And I'm riding with a girl name Keisha smoking on kesh, uh

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Cause I-I can't stay here
If there's no love
I-I can't stay here
Cause I've had enough
Enough of no love
Cause I-I can't stay here
If there's no love...
