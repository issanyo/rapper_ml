[Intro]
All I have in this world...
(what up, blood!)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
They know where Carter at, straight off the launchin' pad
Marchin' on the moon muthafucka, I been to Mars and back
Cleaner than laundry mats, jumpin' in somethin' from
Other countries, companies, junkie, you cannot order that!
I flew that into the water back
Order, go to Iraq and get a car with gas and tell them crackas war with that
All I need is an automatic: tick, boom
I'm a goon, I go zoom; smell the fumes from the vrooms
Young Tune in the room, gimme room, or you doomed
I am soon to get all my chips and doubloons
I would never be another groom unless I assume
The bitch ain't givin' up the womb to him and whom
M.O.B., let me bloom, let me boom
I pop early like firecrackers in the last week of June
I'm gettin' my lunch like noon, I gotta eat
Scarface with diamond teeth

[Hook]
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
Nobody knew my name, they only knew my face

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Lord, protect me from my friends, I can take care of my enemies
I come from where the niggas just kill to save energy
Sorry, world, but my mommy drop me where the clinic be
So if you tried to mimic me you'd probly catch some sick disease
Six degrees, leanin' on that promethathathathazene
I'm a centipede, these men move at women speed
I'm bout my spinach, cheese, dough, chedder, feddi, gwop
Money, moolah, mozzarella, et cetera, et cetera
Fuck competitors, fuck these rappers, fuck these editors
Fuck the head of the state, fuck the gates surroundin' the prisoners
These muthafuckas the prey; I'm the Predator, see me dreadlock
Tough as Bamm-Bamm from Bedrock; I'm tied to the game like wedlock
Say "hello, red dot", say "goodbye, life" and say "hello, Satan"
A devil in the flesh, a rebel at its best, no complainin'
We live in Hell and I'm blessed, Scarface

[Hook]
