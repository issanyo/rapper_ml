Mama you wine fine
Mama you, mama you
Mama, mama you wine fine

We need some quiet time
We need some quiet time
We need some quiet time

Mama you wine fine
Mama you wine fine
And on the hush hush
We need some quiet time

I get, I get, I, I, I get so deep in that pussy
I touch the back of your soul
You gotta man, I bet I can make you pack up and roll
Yea, let's ride like we attached to the road
And if we on the same track, I hope we crash and explode

Yea, where do the passionate go
I beat it up forever, girl I'll take a national oath
Nobody knows what goes on the latch on the door
And if you throw it to me baby, I will catch it and score
Yea, yea

I beat that, I be right when she call me
She got that shit I just can't avoid
She so addictive and she know that
I do anything that she tell me
I am her personal sex toy

And then I pop the bottle of that Cris
I had a glass, she had a glass
I had a glass, she had a glass, again
Ya know, then she was ready got to it
One time, two times, hit me up
And I take that ass again and I told her

Mama you wine fine
Mama you, mama you
Mama, mama you wine fine

We need some quiet time
We need some quiet time
We need some quiet time

Mama you wine fine
Mama you wine fine
And on the hush hush
We need some quiet time

I see ya walkin' like the cameras on ya, I love ya back shots
I'm like a crackhead and you got your crack out
See, we got chemistry baby, we like cat and mouse
You blow my brains out, I blow ya back out
Now what is that about?

You got me sweatin' you so hard, I'm 'bout to pass out
And we could do it on the beach, in the grass house
Say, we could do it on the beach, in my glass house

Uh huh, I know what I'm doin', I'm on it until the mornin'
Hop on it until it's foamin', I bone it better than homie
I want it better than homie, come get on this pony
I put my name on it, I own it

That's right, pin ya to the wall, give ya couple of back bites
Give ya couple of thigh bites, then here comes the highlight
I could make ya act right
Take a ten minute break, then get back right
And then I told her

Mama you wine fine
Mama you, mama you
Mama, mama you wine fine

We need some quiet time
We need some quiet time
We need some quiet time

Mama you wine fine
Mama you wine fine
And on the hush hush
We need some quiet time

Yea, I told her, ya mama gotta be a model or somethin'
And if you was a wine bottle, I'm drunk
She dance on me like it's just us girl
You could make a nigga pay ya rent for 6 months

Shh, I ain't lyin' girl
I could make ya little pussy start cryin' girl
You won't fire girl
You know the fireman could put out the fire girl

Are those apple bottom jeans ya wearin'?
She said these is Donna Karen
So tight, she can't even let air in
Man, I swear I saw a blind man starin'

No lie and I hope she take her clothes off
So we can do it, 'til we doze off
We fall asleep with our clothes off
When we wake up, we pick up where we left off
And then I tell her

Mama you wine fine
Mama you, mama you
Mama, mama you wine fine

We need some quiet time
We need some quiet time
We need some quiet time

Mama you wine fine
Mama you wine fine
And on the hush hush
We need some quiet time
