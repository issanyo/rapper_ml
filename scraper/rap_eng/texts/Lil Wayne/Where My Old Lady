[Intro]
Velvet, velvet, velvet, velvet, velvet, velvet

[Verse 1]
She 5'5, with brown eyes, and she kinda shy, she be tryna hide
But she tryna vibe, but the bottom line is she got a guy, but she compromise, woah
He must be out his mind, or can't find the time, until she out of time, and now he out of town
He always out of town, he say he on the grind, he say she on his mind, she say you "always lying"
He say "Baby don't you see I'm out here on the rise?"
She say "Boy you need to get that shit organised"
But he was working hard on Tha Carter V
He was working hard on Tha Carter V
And a hard working man like me is so hard to find
But now she wanna leave in my darkest times
And now I'm like..

[Chorus]
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch
Where my old lady? I'mma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch?
When I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady at? (Where my old lady?)
Where my old lady at? (Where my old lady?)
And when you see that bitch you better tell that bitch
That when I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch

[Verse 2]
She 5'5, with brown eyes, and she kinda shy, but she qualify
And she modify, and she promised that she ride or die
She kinda lied, left a nigga traumatized
Dramatize, I had to put my pride aside
I've gotten wise, I had to seek with widened eyes
Realize, recognize and strategize
Christian Mingle, E-Harmony, I harmonize
I can buy the world but I can't buy time
You Don't Have To Be lonely, Farmersonly.com
I'm 5'5, with sad eyes
Got my mama's views, with my dad's eyes
Got bad eyes
Cause real love is, what I can't find in the day time with a flashlight
Now where you at hoe?
Where you at hoe?
Got me like..

[Chorus]
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch
Where my old lady? I'mma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch?
When I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady yeah? (Where my old lady?)
Where my old lady yeah? (Where my old lady?)
And when you see that bitch you better tell that bitch
That when I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch

[Verse 3]
If you're out there in the streets and you're looking for me
Yeah, If you're out there in the streets and you're looking for me
Yeah, If you're out there in the streets and you're looking for me
I'll be out there on the creep looking for wifey
Going Sherlock Holmes, Inspector Gadget
Bitches burn Bridges, get stuck in traffic
And pimpin' ain't easy but it gotta be done
I know pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary
It's bigger than me; it's hereditary
So don't blame me for stunting like my daddy
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
And every hoe I done fucked done sucked my dick
Ooh, iPhone give up your location
And iCloud fucked up all your information
Heard you and that nigga on vacation
Damn, I heard you and that nigga on vacation
I'm making reservations
Got my swimming trunks like..

[Chorus]
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch
Where my old lady? I'mma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch?
When I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady at? (Where my old lady?)
Where my old lady at? (Where my old lady?)
And when you see that bitch you better tell that bitch
That when I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch

[Verse 4]
When I find that bitch, Imma kill that bitch
When I find that bitch, Imma kill that bitch
Yeah, watch them hoes when you sleeping
Cause them dog ass hoes be creeping
You gotta watch them watch them watch-watch them bitches
Watch them watch them watch-watch them bitches
Gotta watch them hoes when sleeping
Cause them dog ass hoes be creeping
She 5'5, with brown eyes, and she kinda shy, but she qualified
And she tryna vibe, but the bottom line, is she gotta guy, she unsatisfied
Then she try to hide, hide behind my lies, after I apologized like a thousand times
She ask me to find the time like a thousand times
As soon as I find the time she say "Never mind"
When I try to revitalize, she too occupied
Don't I treat you like Concubine when you and I combine?
Don't I dick you down and make you holla like a soccer mom?
Don't I give you peace of mind, wa alaykum salaam
When I met you 'fore I fucked you, didn't I take my time?
I'll waste a drink on you before I waste your time
Kill the pussy, never flee the scene or the crime
But he was working hard, he was working hard on Tha Carter V
