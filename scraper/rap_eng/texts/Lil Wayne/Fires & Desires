[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Ayy, fires
And desires, burn through the night
Burn through the night
Fires
And desires burn through the night
Burn through the night

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
Alright, well her clothes is on fire, the rose is on fire
The ladder is on fire, but still I climb higher
'Cause her love is what I need, we've been sippin' gasoline
We make love out in the open, we set fire to the trees
Now she callin' me some fireman (huh), I see what's going on
She givin' out fire dome, gotta turn on the sirens on
I walk through the steam for her, yeah she made me fiend for her
Now I'm 'bout to finish her, she need an extinguisher

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Ayy, fires
And desires, burn through the night
Burn through the night
Fires
And desires burn through the night
Burn through the night

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I turned her out, I got her cookin' hard
Fuck takin' pictures, take a bullet for us
I make her count the guap in just her draws
I make her count out loud, I listen hard
I brought her round too many strippers lord
She said fuck tippin' and start kissin' broads
I burnt her out, she need a break lord
I told her hold that tight, you get replaced lord
Ain't got a job, I make her look employed
I made her throw away her pussy toy
She got desire for a fire boy
And she ain't seen a fire higher lord

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Ayy, fires
And desires burn through the night
Burn through the night
Fires
And desires burn through the night
Burn through the night
