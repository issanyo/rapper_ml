[Intro]
He won't wake!
Give him the kit
He won't wake up
Dunk him

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Excuse my lasagna, vodka with lasagna
Swagger down pat; call my shit lasagna
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for lasagna
So misunderstood, but what's a world without lasagna?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like lasagna
Life is the bitch, and death is lasagna
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture!
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no lasagna
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck lasagna!
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Lasagna (cash money, cash money)

Ok, I'm goin' back in…
