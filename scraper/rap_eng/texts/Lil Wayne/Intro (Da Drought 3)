[Intro]
Uh, hello
New mixtape bitch, called Da Drought 3, haha!
This was supposed to be the intro but
I guess I'ma gon... do what y'all came here for...
Yah, yeeah!

[Verse]
Rasta dem king of the jungle
Dreadlocks swing down me back like Rapunzel
My bred'rin sling dem pack in a bundle
We'll take yo ting sell it back to yo uncle
And we'll make it rain 'till ya dances to come true
We'll make it rain til ya better bring a swim suit
Alone when I came but I'm leavin wit dem too
Girls give me brain give me brain like Temple
And him got game game sharp like a pencil
Now if you want fromage we can crash like a cymbal
Look upon me window I'm a new sports coupe
12 horses in the hood sittin on horseshoes
Come from the land dat Jesus walk through
Sacrifice me life man I bleed for me own crew
Dem no wanna rum rum wit me dem no want to
Murder dem and the family dem belong to
Gangsta dem know it run the street like the car do
You can hafta leave me or dearly depart you
Hip hop is mine now, mine what ya gon do?
I can jump on any nigga song and make a part two
Play time for me cause see to me they are cartoons
How come every joint be on point like a harpoon?
How come every bar stand strong like a bar stool?
How come every line so raw you gone snort two?
Murder dem man I murder dem
Fuck a competition man I murder dem
Man I murder dem man I murder dem
Fuck a competition man I murder dem

[Outro]
And that is why I'm hot! Haha!
It's Da Drought 3, welcome! Have fun!
