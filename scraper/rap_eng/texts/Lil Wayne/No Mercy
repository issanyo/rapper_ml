[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
One for the hurt, one for the heal
But one from the hammer'll get a nigga killed
Fill a nigga up, then this for real
We gon' hit a nigga up, and split a nigga meal
Yeah
If niggas actin' how they feel-
Then I pull it out the jacket, get to clappin' like a seal!
Yeah
Kidnappin' the lil ones
Throwin' bitch niggas off the back of buildings!
I hope you know how to fly and sincerely
I would do the same thing to everyone you live with
Everything you stand for, I send 'em to the heaven's sky
Weezy F. Baby, boy get it right everytime
I hope you know how to fly and sincerely
I would do the same thing to everyone you live with
Everything you stand for, I send 'em to the heaven's sky
Weezy F. Baby, boy get it right everytime

[Verse 2: PH4DE]
Water whippin' in dishes set from the last supper
Bought the kitchen, now religion's in the crack muscle
Thought your bitch had a vision- Until her back-buckled
Now she can't sit down, she only Half-Humble!
(Hold up, Hold up)
Splash in it- belly flop
She wanna Cum my way, no Fetty Wap
So I put her on a girl for a couple of days
Made 'em scissor till they came, called it Cut N' Paste!
I ain't hard to find tho
Got a couple Rollies for the Same you buyin' Time Fo'
Got a 50 that'll reach into your timezone
Wet 'em up, 'till he nothin' but a dry bone!
See my arrow's out, till the Quiver-End (Quivering)
You ain't heard this kind of beat?- it's different
Wayne's PH4DED, We made it Pussy, I'm in again-
Throw a little salt in the wound, then pour the liquor in!

Yeah, PH4DE!
