[B.G.]
Okay

[Verse 1]
First thing first - and for me that's n's
I floss, so I know you gon' let me pimp Benz
If I want it, no matter the cost, I'll get it
It's mine, so I know you gon' let me spend it
My clique made it known: we 'bout havin' things
Sport diamonds, so I know you gon' let us bling
B.G.: shut it down when I come through
They say I'm wrong, but I know you gon' let me do what I do
If I got it, I ain't gon' hide it - I show mine
I know you gon' respect it, I know you gon' let me shine
I know you ain't gon' step, I know you know I tote iron
Quick to bust, and I know you don' wan' die
You see eight Bentleys comin' on a late Sunday
I know you know that's Cash Money Millionaires comin'
We be layin' it down - don't give a fuck, nigga
We're from uptown, so I know you gon' let us stunt, nigga

[Lil Wayne]
Hey (Hey) Hey (Hey) Hey (Hey)
Listen, listen:

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I know you see the jewelry - it's berserk and on shine
I know you see the bulge under the shirt - don't try
I know you people wishin' that one day we gon' stop
I know you recognize we got the game on lock

I know you see the Bentleys, the broads, the Dubs
I know you see the thugs - you don't wanna see no blood
I know you people wishin' that one day we gon' stop
I know you recognize we got the game on lock

[Verse 2]
I know you bet' not open your mouth when I ride by
I know you know this Lex GS on shine
I spin through fast, wrist hangin' out the dropped Jag
Blindin' ya - I know you gon' let me act bad
I know you gon' let me go off, let me show my ass
I know you gon' let me show off, make haters mad
Got game to make your wife cheat, give me head
Fuck your husband for Geezy - I know you gon' break bread
I know you clowns don't like it, gotta accept it
You don't, get wetted - I know you gotta respect it
You don't want Geezy bringin' drama to your set'n'
I know you don't want sis, Mom, and daughter in black dresses
Please don't test me - you do, it get hectic
I shoot for the head - don't depend on vests
Now on the up and up I'm every bad bitch choice
Don't be mad, I know you gon' let me be a hot boy

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Hook (Lil' Wayne)]

[Verse 3]
Hoes say I'm nasty - I know you gon' let me slang wood
Say I changed - I'm rich, I know you gon' let me be good
I'm the same ol' nigga I was when I was broke
Still beef, so I know you gon' let me tote my four-four
Now, you know what happened: tried to play me like a ho
We both can't live on this earth - one of us gotta go
On the real, when it come to shinin', I'm nothin' nice
You'll be blinded, and I know you don't like when I wear ice
I know you gon' let me burn, I'm "h" "o" "t"
I know you gon' let me be me - that's B.G
I know you gon' respect my clique: CMB
I know you don't want beef with Juv, Turk, and Wheezy
I know you don't wan' put your car next to Fresh or B
I know you ain't got the price like them: ten a-piece
I know you bet' stay in your place - don't fuck with us
I know you ain't on our level cause we platinum plus

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, hey (hey) hey (hey) hey (hey, hey)

[Hook-2x (Lil Wayne)]

[Lil Wayne]
Lock, shop, bam, lock-...-down
What!
