[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula
Mula on my mind, on my mind, brain tumor
So addicted to her, faithful and restricted to her
I know she been around but a lot of niggas blew her
I'ma take good care of her
Make sure you aware of her
Put her on the table, break her down like a skeleton
Sippin' on the gelatin
Smokin' on the melatin
It's just me and my girlfriend, Makaveli-in'
I told wifey she too pricey
And then I went got icy
A nigga get poltergeist-y for the Breitling
If you baller blocking, invite me
I cheated on my girl, she still recuperating
It's Weezy Baby and Mula
But our friends call us Mula Baby
I'm gone

[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
I cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula (yeah)
Took her to the mall, then I took her to the jeweller (yeah)
I might fuck around, then go put her in the bank (yeah)
When you gettin' money, give a fuck 'bout what they think (yeah)
Like oh woah, oh, oh, oh
Cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula
Like oh woah, oh, oh, oh
Cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula (yeah)

[Outro: Zoey Dollaz]
Cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula (yeah)
