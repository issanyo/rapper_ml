Rasta dem king of da jungle
Dreadlocks swing down me back like Repunzel
My bread run sling dem pack in a bundle
We'll take yo ting sell it back to yo uncle
And we'll make it rain til ya dances to come true
We'll make it rain til ya better bring a swim suit
Alone when I came but Im leavin wit dem too
Girls give me brain give me brain like Temple
And him got game game sharp like a pencil
Now if you want vermeils we can crash like a cymbal
Look upon me window Im a new sports coupe
12 horses in da hood sittin on horseshoes
Come from da land dat Jesus walk through
Sacrifice me life man I bleed for me own crew
Dem no wanna rum rum wit me dem no want to
Murder dem and da family dem belong to

Gangsta dem know it run da street like da car do
You can either leave me or dearly depart you
Hip hop is mines now mines what ya gone do
I can jump on any nigga song and make a part two
Play time for me cuz see to me they are cartoons
How come every joint be on point like a harpoon
How come every bar stand strong like a bar stool
How come every line so raw you gone snort to
Murder dem man I murder dem
Fuck a competition man I murder dem
Man I murder dem man I murder dem
Fuck a competition man I murder dem
