[Lil Wayne]
It's everybody man
Everybody cross the [?], everybody cross the Grove
You already knew, man
If you don't know what I'm saying
Then play this shit back, cause I don't know what I'm saying
But this is a dedication to the streets
The gangstas, the hood, the fallen soldiers
The down-ass chicks and the people in the slums
Young Money, mofucka (dedication to my Mom)
You understand me?
Dedication to our family
That was coming, you see how I spit
And we are Young Money, man
This is a Dedication, people
It's gangsta grills, you mothafuckas
Understand that, and who I am?
I am Young Wayne, but now you can call me
This is "Tha Carter", people
