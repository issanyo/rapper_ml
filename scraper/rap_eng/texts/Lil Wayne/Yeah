[Hook - T.I.]
All the whips on four’s and my wrist so froze
Ain’t no problem with these hoes, Rhey don’t never say no
All they sayin’ (Yeah) I keep ‘em sayin’ (Yeah)
Hey they be sayin’ (Yeah) We got ‘em sayin’ (Yeah)
You know my clicks so cold and my pockets so swole
And we bet a hundred more, I don’t never say no
All I say is (Yeah) Say bet I’m sayin’ (Yeah)
Say what I’m sayin’ (Yeah) You know I’m sayin’ (Yeah)

[Verse 1 - T.I.]
I’m ridin’ through the city blowin’ purple on a Saturday
See the APDP well you got to put the gat away
See them nigga comin’ let it blow like Donald Hathaway
In the SLR, all the doors open thata way
Supermodel, movie star, the stripper, brawds after me
Nigga try to battle me but all they do is rattle me
I ask them man 'what happenin?' I’m laughin’ while they chatterin’
I’m bustin’ they be scattering, you know you lookin’ at a king
Super clean in a new drop stuntin’
Nigga talk shit but it ain’t ’bout nothin’
You’ll get your ass kicked if your mouth keep runnin’
Keep talk slick ’bout the sound we comin’
Say what you want but this is how we runnin’
Niggas still tryna ball out we done it
My wrist so bright and my neck so shiny
When I tell her lets go she don’t back up from me

[Hook - T.I.]

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I’m me like a motherfucker
Flyer than a vampire lookin’ for a blood sucker
I keep these hoes on E like a four runner
Man I could throw a 100 g’s till my stone runner
Get a couple of philly’s and some waters for these hoes stomach
I keep ‘em rollin’ like no brakes up in that four runner
I don’t stop, I’m on the clock like the smallest hands
Just look for me, I move the bass up out that marching band
That ain’t a coffee can, nigga that 400 grands
I keep the block jumpin’, just call me bunny man
T make a blunt look like a arm without a fuckin’ hand
Fee break a pound straight down like a bucket man
You could get it harder or get it lighter than a summer tan
The section leader over the stove like a drummer man
Brr-at-at-tat, whip it up just like that, that
But if a nigga fuck with me wrong then its Brr-at-at-at-dat

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
I like my whip so old and my top better fold
Ain’t a problem with these hoes, they don’t never say no
All they say is (Yeah) I keep ‘em sayin’ (Yeah)
You know they sayin’ (Yeah) Ya dig? (Yeah)
You know my click so bold, all of ‘em don’t slow
Niggas shot never broke, they don’t never say no
You need that work (Yeah) We got that work (Yeah)
You need that work (Yeah) We got that work
Ya dig?

[Verse 3 - T.I. & Lil Wayne]
I’m in a drop six-four low-low
When a ho get hit no slow mo
Five mil on the tour no promo
I’m at these pussy niggas' ass, no homo
No homo, they suck like Tony Romo
So fuck them and fuck you too
Now go tell that to Bono
They hoes know, she loves when I shoot my two
22’s on the Coupe I cruise
Sucka niggas tryna juke my mood
They do what they can, I do what I choose
I get these hoes the blues
Just call me BB King
If they can’t feel the monster
How can they see the King?
