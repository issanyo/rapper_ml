[Intro - Christina Milian]
Never
Never

[Verse 1 - Christina Milian]
I been lying here, staring at the wall
Since I met you I’ve been so messed up, it’s critical
I want your everything
But you ain’t giving back
It’s getting deep now
It’s getting deep now
I was crazy, so-so naive too
You mean everything to me
But I mean nothing to you

[Hook - Christina Milian]
Never should’ve said hello
Never should’ve let my eyes turn back
I was happy on my own
I never should’ve said, said, said hello, hello

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Uh, smoking on some grass
Got me thinking ’bout yo’ ass
Can’t believe it didn’t last
Ride or die, I guess we crashed
Left me hanging and now I’m drinking
And I don’t drink, but I’m no saint
Broke my heart like I break the bank
Damn, gotta watch my love boat sink
What? You think your shit don’t stank?
Fucking with you, now I gotta see a shrink
I think about you more than I blink
And we were so right, write like ink
I think you want me like I want you…
Overall, like a jumpsuit
You can count on me like 1 2
But you dropped me like a sunroof
Fuck’s up with that?
I want yo’ ass back
So won’t you pass back
And throw that ass back
Damn, and we don’t even speak no mo’
But you had me at hello

[Hook - Christina Milian]

[Verse 3 - Christina Milian]
I been lying here, staring at the wall
Since I met you I’ve been so messed up, it’s critical
I want your everything
But you ain’t giving back
It’s getting deep now

[Hook - Christina Milian & (Lil Wayne)]
Never should’ve said hello
Never should’ve let my eyes turn back
I was happy on my own
I never should’ve said, said, said hello, hello
(Young Mula baaabbby)
Never should’ve said hello
Never should’ve let my eyes turn back
I was happy on my own
I never should’ve said, said, said hello, hello
