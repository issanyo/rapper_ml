Drought Three
Haha
Look, I Bought It Out Like Stunna
I Hope When We Kiss We Make Ya Sick To Ya Stomach
Stuntin Like My Daddy And Ya Mamma Eat Rubbas
I Bet That I Can Do The Mouth To Mouth With Ya Woman
My House Is A Dungeon
Yellow Diamond Ring Lookin Like A Little Funion
Stand On My Toes You Can Call Me Paul Bunyan
Switchin Up My Floors Like A Nigga Do Construction
The Microphone Wet Cause My Words Like Seduction
N Wen We On Tha Jet Ya Don't Come Up In The Discussion
And If Ya Say Ya Ballin We Prolly Don't Trust Ya
And I Know Plenty Freaky Hoes That Prolly Won't F*ck Ya
Even If Ya Bad Boy They Prolly Won't F*ck Ya
Only If I Say That She Can Touch Ya Like Busta
But She Mite Touch Ya N Burn Ya Like Usha
Me N My Clique Be In Red Like Brusha
I Shit These Rappers Out N Sometimes I Forget To Flush Ya
Granddaddy Purp Or Bubba Kush Crusha
Explode In A Bitch Mouth Like A Gusha
Cash Money, Young Money Check The Production
I Am Just A Martion Get Prepared For Abduction
I Walk It Out Like Crutches
Two Girls Jump Me Like Double Dutches
My Nigga T-Streets Know A Girl Named Duchess
N Everytime We See Her In The Streets She Be Cussin
I Told Him He Should Wave The Black Flag Cause She Buggin
He Say The Pussy Good
He Say Ya Dig So I Dug Em
I'm Lookin For A Real Bad Bitch With A Husband
I Give Her Much Dick And A Whole Lotta Nuttin
I'm Spiitin Like I stumbled On A Gold Pot Or Sumtin
N Wen I Was Six I Saw My Role Modle Hustlin
So I Gotta Hustle
These Rappers Talkin Bout A Whole Lotta Nuttin
Ya Drop Me On Saturday I'm Sold Out On Sunday
F*ck Is The Arguin Bout
Nigga The Carter Out
This Is What I Call A Drought... 3
N We Don't Walk It Out
We Drop Top Porshe It Out
Ya Betta Walk Em Out
Before We Chalk Em Out
We Chalk It Out
We Chalk It Out
We Chalk It Out
We Chalk It Out
We Chalk It Out
We Chalk It Out
We Chalk It Out
We Chalk Em Out
They Don't Want It Uhh Uhh
No They Don't Want It Uhh Uhh
You See They Phony I'm Not
Oh Yea They Phony I'm Not
I Eastside Walk It Out
I Bring New Orleans Out
I Am A Saints Fan
O Yea We Marchin Now
Like Were A Saints Band
I Play The Organs Now
And If They Talkin Most Likely I'm What They Talkin Bout
My Nigga T From The East roll up that forest now
Man I'm Jus Tryin To Get My Peanuts, I'm Like Charlie Brown
Ok That Engine Make That Harley Sound
Take Two Leave Then Walk Around
Come Straight from that Homeless Town, this game belongs to Carter Now Bitch
