[Intro: will.i.am]
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I was on the block right, wasn't in my right mind
Just a young nigga, hustling, trying to get mines
Movin' with the 9 double M
Niggas like, "You don't really wanna fuck with him"
Yeah, young teenager, infatuated with paper
Yeah I had to get it cause momma, she wasn't able
Black and white TV set, no cable
40's in the fridge, chicken noodles on the table
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
Child of the ghetto, raised off a different tune
Watching Bob Barker in my living room
If the price was right, I could get you a whole living room
Yeah, them was my gutter ways back in the gutter days
No education but the gutter pays
Through it all, I came a long way
From selling the yay, fist fights to gun play, back then

[Hook: will.i.am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
G-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I’m on top
Ain’t no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot
And get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, times is hard as it is
That's why I got guns and my guns got kids
That's why I be going so tough on them hoes
I play my own hand, I don't shuffle or fold
Fuck with a nigga, let go fuck with some hoes
Hear them bitches screaming like they stuck in a hole
I am not a demon but was once a lost soul
Till I found myself a block away from the cross road
I have, outgrown the fishbowl
And I'm on my feet like a fucking insole
Yeah it may hurt like a fucking lymph node
But it's fuck the world like a fucking nympho
And we spend dough cause we make more
And I make sure when I say so
It's Jay Rock and Weezy, need I say more?
Clothesline the beat, Ted DiBiase flow, yeah

[Hook: will.i.am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
G-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I’m on top
Ain’t no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot
And get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock, still that same OG
I ain't trying see the grave or the penitentary
Everyday living, trying to stay on my feet
Even though a nigga paid but my heart in the streets
See my dogs, I'm a beast, so hard on these beats
So my family can eat, I'll be damned if I see no income
Here come Jay Rock, they know
Crack music, drug kingpin flow, oh

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Kingpin ho, need I say more?
Your family could die, when I say go (go)
Green light, green light, what ya green like?
Before ya sign me up, get the scene right
And I just hop in the phantom when I'm feelin nice
Cause driving slow in the Lam', it doesn't seem right
Yeah, and I remember them long nights
Living the wrong life but I made that wrong right, Weezy

[Bridge]
All the struggling, all it does is keep me hustling, oh my

[Hook: will.i.am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
G-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I’m on top
Ain’t no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot
And get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
