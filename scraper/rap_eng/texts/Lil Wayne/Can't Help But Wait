I can't help but wait
I can't help but wait, check it out

I see you, you wit him, he ain't right but you don't trip
You stand by, while he lies, then turn right round and forgive
I can't take, to see your face wit those tears running down yo cheeks
But what can I do, I gotta stay true, because deep down I'm still a G

And I don't wanna come between you and your man
Even tho I know I'll treat you better than he can
Girl I can't help but wait

[Chorus]
Till you get back wit him, it don't change (Can't help but wait)
Till you see that wit me, it ain't the same (Can't help but wait)
Till you, see you, for what you really are (Baby girl you are a star)
And I can't help but wait

It ain't fresh, to just let him call the shots
Your a queen, you should be, getting all that someones got
You should be rocking the latest, and purses, bracelets and watches
You're worth much more than an occasional "I love you", "I'm thinking of you"

And I don't wanna come between you and your man, no
Even tho I know I'll treat you better than he can
Girl I can't help but wait

[Chorus]
Get it together, you can do better
Seeing is believing, and I see what you need so
I'm gonna play my position, let you catch what you been missing
I'm calling out! Girl because I can't help but wait

[Chorus: x2]
Can't help but wait, can't help but wait, can't help but wait, no, no, no
