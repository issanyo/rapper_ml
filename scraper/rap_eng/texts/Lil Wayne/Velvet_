(Verse?)
Niggas ask me how i'm doin'
I can't wait to say i'm good
They say "be careful she know what she doin', but as long as you Good then we good" that's my niggas
Nigga you look
You a whole different person
You make it look perfect, when everyone hurry

(Chorus?)
Hoes, hoes ain't nothing but hoes
Those, hoes ain't nothing but hoes
None of those hoes compare to the woman that I chose (oh)
Now all them hoes mad
