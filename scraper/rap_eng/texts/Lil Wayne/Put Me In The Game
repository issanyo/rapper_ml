Verse 1:
I got a bus like John Madden baby
We can go all around the world
I never talked to dem boys that sat on dem benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
And ima leave them boys at the line of scrimmage
These boyz all behind me winless
I ain't Mario Williams but I'm not defenseless
Widerecieva catchin hailmary's I'm Christian
5 and out hydraul yes we stick shift
Comin wit da quick hits, fast wit instincts
Cornerbacks safeties, I burn'em like incents
ON the field I'm daddy and the ball is my infant
I don't need to much support but I'm in love with the pigskin
All I really know how to do is win
Super bowl champ, Disney world, let the kids in
Hall a fame Wayne, I'm putting ma dibs in
Catch me in the game on fourth an inches

Chorus:
I don't talk to'em, I don't talk to'em, I don't talk to'em
I don't, I don't talk to them boyz that sat on dem benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
Put me in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
And ima leave them boys at the line of scrimmage

Verse 2:
Uhh I am a New Orleans Saint, and to the Houston Texans I'd like to say thanks
Reggie Bush baby!, Reggie Bush baby! Drew Brees, Marques Colston, Sean Peyton
I'm relentless, I'm offensive, I'm expensive, like tom benson
Super dome is goin down it's high time boy
We sick of linin on the fifty yard line boy
Hey quarterback I'm gonna bust through your line boy
Your jersey says your last name, but you mine boy
I'm so fast before I leave I been gone
Okay you win it's on, I'm in the end zone
Wheres your chinstrap? Why isn't it on?
Cuz if I hit you you gone have to strap yo chin on
See I'm score on any goal line, it's on
Fourth and inches let the crowd catch this song

Chorus:
I don't talk to'em, I don't talk to'em, I don't talk to'em
I don't, I don't talk to them boyz that sat on dem benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
Put me in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
And ima leave them boys at the line of scrimmage
