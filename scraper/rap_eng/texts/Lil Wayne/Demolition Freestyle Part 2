[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]

More money, more bitches
More work, more haters, equals more snitches
More digits, no, more commas
Me affiliated with trendsetters equals more drama
Weezy Obama, that's my co-signer
You see Osama, in my persona
Steamin' like a sauna, sick I need a doctor
Stab you fore I drown you, now you just another red lobster
Where the bitches at? I need a head doctor
Nice thick & red bitch you fuckin' with a top shot-ah
Top dolla, nigga Young Money
We got old money, dont play dumb money
All black whips, all red flags
Put that red dot on your head, play head tag
Real niggas listen, when I'm preachin' to em'
Now we all know money talks, cause I'm speakin' to em'

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

Uh-Umm, but I ain't speakin' to em
I call my guns Jumpers cause my bullets just leapin' to 'em
All you boys bustas, so soft, bet the wind blew em'
I claim flame, I am just rekindlin'
My intuition is get paid
But this Glock will knock you back to 5th grade
I, school you niggas but none of yous get A's
Got a bitch who won't stop till everyone of us get laid
Lot of you niggas is son of a bitch made
And if your girlfriend utter, I cut her like switch blades
Yeah, we ridin' like roller blades
Now gon' give me head till it fall off of your shoulder babe
I smoke a O a day, that's why I'm so away
Mentally mind blown now gon and blow away
Yeah, ya'll niggas is super fake
I put you niggas on mute, then I mutilate
Yeah, I Mac like the computer say
My hoes cooperate, I mean co-operate
I don't know how to say, oh but I gotta say
I just fo' five away till ain't no one alive to say
That I fo' five'd away, then I drive away
Paper chasin' money runnin' like andale'
Better find a way, better not be in our way
I'll take you farther than Zimbabwe
I make it harder for these wimps I stay on they necks no lettin' up
And I tote that can opener, don't make me bust your 7 up
Heaven up, hell down, man down, gal down
And I keep that hammer do you wanna get nailed down?
Better kneel down, cause I am the god
I am the hardest mothafucka to try it before
My diet is ya'll, I riot and war
Fightin' 'em all, bitin' 'em all, giant or small, I am a dog
I can smile at dumb bitches and brighten 'em all
I am a hog, ridin' 'em all
I just lay that pipe and I'm off
Call me plumber, and give your girl my number, hombre
I am a bumble, bee on a humble
Your girlfriend want my pickle and my cucumber
Tell your boyfriend I'll turn him to a vegetable
Break a nigga down to a decimal, I'm tellin' you
I'm very cool, unless a fool, fuckin' up my revenue
I tote that whatever dude, I shoot at whatever dude
Just bought a Lamborghini Murcielago
And my girl from the bay say it's "hella cool"
Wheres the helipad? my helicopter land
I shot the man, if I'm not the man
Do I go in, or I go in, I'm not your friend, I'm not your kin
I make your brain come out your chin
Been in the game since the begnnin'
Im all about winnin'
I look down I see them, when I look up I don't see any
You're Pooh like Winnie, do I diddy
And I just left, but your boo right with me
And Im from never do right city
But don't get me wrong, Young Money I'm gone
Yeah, Young Moola Baby
