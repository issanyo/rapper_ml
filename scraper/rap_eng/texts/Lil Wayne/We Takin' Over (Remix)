[Intro]
Yessir!
It's me, the rapper eater
Feed me, feed me, feed me!
No homo

[Verse]
One time for me, one time for the DJ
He be Khaled, I be Lil Weezy
Baby, if you ask me, if you're nasty
Creative, gifted bastard, spit sporadic
I'm so diplomatic, democratic
Touch it, bring it, push it, systematic
Damn right, I kissed my daddy
I think they pissed at how rich my daddy
Is, and I'm his kid, I stunt with my daddy
Call Miss Lee, she with my daddy
So diss me and don't diss my daddy
'Cause who was there when no one wasn't? Just my daddy
Who was there when I needed money? Just my daddy
So who be there when I see the money? Just my daddy
Who said that I'd be the one? Just my daddy
Hello hip-hop, I'm home; it's your daddy
When I say deez, I don't mean the Caddy
I mean deez nuts, Akon's and Khaled's
Rick Ross, T.I.P., Stunna and Fat Joe
And I ca-ca-can't forget Brisco
And yeah, I done squashed the bullshit with Zoe
It's a bakery here, just tryin' to get dough
Shout to my dreads, my Haitians and chicos
You lookin' for me, ho? I'm in the 3-0-
5, I'm the best rapper alive
Homeboy got a mind that a map wouldn't find
Homeboy got a 9 that a cop wouldn't find
But I could get to it even if I was blind
Like a scary movie, they screamin' when I rhyme
I'm a king, you can ask Stephen if I'm lyin'
I'm a Prince, too demandin' like my mom
Too bold, too cold like wet salam-
Mi, me, it's all about me
If the girl got a voice, then she talk about me, me
He say, she say, I say me
We'll be in the M-I-A-Mi
With me, and T, and big Roni
And the Homie streets, probly somewhere on the beach
And Taz and E probly somewhere in the Jeep
And Marley in the Phantom with Mister G
And me, me, it's all about me
Play with me and it's all-out beef
Beef! Yes! Chest! Feet!
Tag! Bag! Blood! Sheets!
Yikes! Yeeks! Great Scott
Storch, can I borrow your yacht?
Watch me and my clique go all out
Like the ball in the stands, we balls out
Boy, I don't know what y'all 'bout
But I just spit like a dog mouth
Pink ice, just lookin' like a hog mouth
Vroom, I had to bring the hog out
Light them trees, bring a log out
Every day Christmas, I'm eggnogged out
And hip-hop is my new-bought house
My flow just grew legs and walked out; bye
