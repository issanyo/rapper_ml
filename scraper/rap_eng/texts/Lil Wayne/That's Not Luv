That’s not love
That’s not love
That’s not love
Not real true love

[Verse 1 - Trae]
Chea, I woke up this morning feeling the world forgot about me
But then I remembered I’m the streets, it ain’t no life without me
Now what they really know about me? other than the fact I’m a asshole
And it’s death for any bitch tryna take it up out me
I’m in the game so tell them niggers I’mma leave with somethin’
I’m half an hour pass my patience, bitch I’m needing some
I eat niggers up like they dinner, digest ‘em and shit ‘em out
And re-direct them to the classes of a new beginner
They say I never cheer (why), I don’t associate myself with other packs of gorillas
That see that they miss the real
So understand before I loose, I swear to leave ‘em sicker than…
When they heard the news, that ain’t love, damn

[Hook & (Lil Wayne)]
That’s not love
That’s not love (yeahhh, ay Trae I got you)
That’s not love (and I’m still poured up baby)
Not real true love (just pray for me sweetheart, yeah)

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Snakes in the grass, so I stay on the pavement
Survived the battle when Adam was a cavemen
And dead animals and dead men
I’m all in and my only friend is Amen
Keep your mouth closed, you wanna know why you die?
The answer’s right under your nose
And in the game I don’t sleep, in the game I don’t cheat
I just play my position, get MVP
I just gon’ wipe the dishes till they spot-free
Trae you can count on me like 1, 2, 3
Keep my business in my pocket, never wash with bleach
And I never show my hand, not even to me
If that ain’t love

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Trae]
They been questioning if this real, well bitch I’m here to answer
I’m on that shit that hit your life in last stages of cancer
A couple decades of head is what your mind is on
There ain’t no keeping up with me, I’m in a different time zone
If I don’t rap, I’mma trap, if I don’t trap, I’mma slap the clip in F8
And get like Busta Rhymes and make it clap
Yeah they told you I’m gangster, fuck what you talking about
Ain’t no rapper gon’ have your body, see your spirit walking out
I’m so Houston homie, AB and speak for itself
When I speak, please shut the fuck up cause I ain’t speaking for him
Uh, they saying Trae back in that zone
Tell them motherfuckers they weren’t wrong
Nigga fuck love, shit
