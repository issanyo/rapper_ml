[Verse 1]
This here ain't free, this ain't oxygen
I'm taking all the love I can give
I'm on some 'I'm right back papa shit'
Why you just floppin' shit?
We do the opposite
My flow is stupid
My swagga retarded
But bitch I'm  not far from incompetent
Don't condone violence
But if they want problems
We want the phone like we parliment
Someone tell Weezy to gimme a call
I'm feelin' like him in 2008
A whole bunch of haters, I whole bunch of favors
I feelin' like granus a mile away
I'm lookin' adversity in her face
Imma drink coffee, all I need is mug
Like 4 bitch I like you better when you dress down
She be acting too satiti when she clean up
I'm fresh off a tour
My granny just died
I feel like I have got no patience left
To walk in my shoes, is to follow a giant
But this nigga still takin' baby steps
They must not know who they rappin' with
I'm way too focused an accurate
I'm on my grind, I'm so Indie
That shit be from Indianapolis
If theres a will we can make a way
That s what the [?] can't take away
Take her pants off. like she wearing break aways
And we finish off , Mary Jane, paper planes
Heavy kicking like i'm weraing ackle weights
Dodgoing my exes for o's like i'm writing' plays
I swear I feel like jhonny cage
Inside my whole mouth like Jhanny dang
Money is nothin'. I make a G, eazy
Do that from the Bay to the Universe
In lovewith the money
I'm all in m y feelings  and bitch i would not get my feelings hurt
I can;t do nothing probono
Nigga don't like me, it's fuck em
No homo
Shit done got crazy i hit the road solo
I can;t fuck with you, bor, batty boys no more
We come from Cali, my girls come from Soho
Lie to me baby, my dick like Pinociho
89 baby like 5'5's and 44
Smoking that loud got me so anti-social
Study my vocals
Copy my style
How can this rap niggas not be my child?
I guess we in Bae what they got to do now
Ohh, my grandma is proud of her child
I be feeling like the man when i roll
West coast wanna ht, we can roll too
Nigga hit my twitter like he missin the old Su
Swallow my pride it was nasty like cold food
Yeah
Lets get it
