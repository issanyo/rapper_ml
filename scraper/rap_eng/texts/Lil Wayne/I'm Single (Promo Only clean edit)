Uh, Camel shorts and bubble Kush
We can talk she'd rather fuss
This and that bout such and such
Damn where is the fucking trust
I'm tired of the hoop and holler'n
I'm bout to take the coupe to collins
Uh, then take a female to the Island
Uh then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah now she hearing with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she prolly out chea fucking niggas
I'm fucking her friends now her friends ain't even fucking with her
Damn she text me all day and night
So pissed off she ain't even spelling shit right
I text her back, tell her it's life
Now somebody tell them hoes, I'm single for the night

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like nino
I ain't trippin on nothin
I'm sipping on somethin
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single
Yeah I'm single
And I'm single
Tonight I'm single
And I ain't trippin on nothin
I'm sipping on somethin
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
Tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreads braided to the back
I'm chilling but my swag on full attack
And my girl acting like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And I when get home she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, polo draws
Now make me take this polo off
Girl you can get broken off
Yeah I fuck you for an hour then I smoke it off
Swimming trunks and bathing suits
They go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight
Man somebody tell em hoes I'm single for the night

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Uhh, now she got on her fuck em dress
And I got on my double breast
Uh, and he been fussing all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be weezy f baby sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold on
She say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Uh, hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's bout to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard both times
We both say we single
And we both lying
We both wrong but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night
Put your hands up if you single

[Chorus]
