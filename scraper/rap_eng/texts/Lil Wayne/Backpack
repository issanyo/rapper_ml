[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You said “I come in peace” so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn’t have a friend, didn’t know what it was
You taught how to dream and how to love
You’re my best friend please listen to me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Greetings, I fell from the sky
I’m from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed, I’m the only one that survived
I’ve only taking over this planet since I arrived
I’m in a backpack, I’m ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I’m an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne’s world

[Bridge: Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

[Outro]
On our planet we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted
It's a gift from the mother
In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace
