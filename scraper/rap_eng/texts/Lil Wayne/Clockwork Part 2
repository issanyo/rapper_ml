Two for five or a dime, that's clockwork

Move it around, and around, and around, and around like a clock chick
To the sound, of the sound, of the sound of the clock's tick
Tick, tock, tick, tock, AY

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Mad trees and shrees and dungarees
The city under siege
Kitchen 100 degrees
I love that summer breeze I stand in it til' it freeze
I'm from another creed them S-s-southern G's
I sip Promethazine I lean I stand tall
I'm mean I'm mad raw I'm comin' like fastballs
Steee-rike, Yup, so get it right
One of my snippets'll end your whole life
You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife
In a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat pork
So be smart and play your own part
If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart
And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell
Hey, I'ma shoot it out if I'm facing the L
Yea, so tell your girl to come and make me rich
Weezy Baby nigga, 9 to 5, 10 to 6
All day
