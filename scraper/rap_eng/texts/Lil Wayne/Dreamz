[Verse 1: Rebel]
I said I'm on my way
But I'm running kind of late
I got so much on my mind
I got so much on my plate
You know I'd call you right now
I hope everything's okay
We haven't spoken since that day
Shit is eating up my brain
You know I gotta grind
Each and everyday
Each and every kind of way
I'm doing this for me
'Cause I'm not trying to be some fool running in the streets
I want people to remember me
I wanna have a destiny
I wanna live freely with no regrets
And no one knows my name yet
But like I said, I don't need that fame yet
Glory comes to those who chase it
And not to those who wait for it
Right now I'm feeling kind of down
'Cause you let me go
You left me on this boat
With no place to go
But I'm getting through it
Might as well 'cause I know time will tell
But it be moving like a snail
Yeah I know you got a new one and I wish you well
I can't hold myself
I gotta build myself
I gotta build myself

[Bridge: Rebel]
I'm going up high and I'm gon' reach the skies
And I ain't gon' stop there
I'm running up the stairs
And I'm getting prepared cause' the end is near
I don't want no fears
I'm making it clear
I'm going up high and I'm gon' reach the skies
And I ain't gon' stop there

[Verse 2: Rebel]
I know shit ain't easy
No one's baking me a cake
I'm not gonna take a break
There's no point of going away
That's why I say what I say
This love feels kind of fake
Until the day that I break
I'm gon' make my way to the top
To the shop till we drop
This Groove shit, you know how we rock
The name is Rebel
I won't stop till I'm shot
Hope ya know what I'm about
Mama seeing that I try
Pops wants me to reach the sky
Hope they see that I ain't playing
Hope they know that I'll survive
Me and Siah chasing dreams
Giving life through this artistry
We won't stop until we see the green
Getting paid like vending machine
When I saw you we ain't speak
At the moment we was weak
All we need is just peace
I know it's hard to think of me but don't worry
You'll be free
From all the paid and suffering
Just wait and I'll leave
We both know that that's key
Speak the truth even if it kills me
I'm chasing dreams I'm not living in a fantasy

[Outro: Rebel]
I know
I know, time is moving real slow
But I gotta go
Up and down the road
