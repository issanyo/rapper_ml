[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Dark ass shades, I can’t see them haters
Now eat these fuckin bullets, don’t forget to tip the waiter
I don’t drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt
Bitch I’m on that Patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go “pu”
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go “pu”
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go “pu”
Got-Got a mean ass swagga, my bitches do too

[Verse: R0th]
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go "pu"
They broke down the addies, yeah I had a few
Gotta case full of paper, bills bigger than Frank
Getting drunk off liquor, call me Frank the Tank
Getting drunk of beer bongs, getting high off bong rips
Nothing but a thing when your girl got some small tits
Getting all this money cause I'm fucking bossin'
Self made bitch, I be Rick Rossin'
Born in the field, sent straight to Pardee
Fashionably late, bitch give me that tardy
Yeah, three letters three numbers
125 affiliated, we getting faded
We getting aided, yeah we looking rated R
Look in my eyes, you see a fucking star
I am the big dipper, yeah I'm a syrup sipper
Money being thrown like I'm a fucking stripper
I don't mean to be rude, but I gotta do what I do
Get high up, get lifted, take the Box Gang attitude
Glasses up, fill them all with champagne
You can't see my eyes from these dark shades
