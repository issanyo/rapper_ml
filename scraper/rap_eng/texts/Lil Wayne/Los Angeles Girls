{Pre-Chorus}
(Los Angeles girls, Los Angeles girls
I ever need you, and you be on my brain
Yeah)

{Chorus}
Los Angeles girls , They be trapping in my hood
They be going for my wood, And they made me understood
That these girls are all lying, And they love it when your dying
Keep you talkin till you tryin, When your close they leave you crying (Its all fake tho)
Why she coming on so slow? Why she dont wanna go?
Hanging with the rest I’m like a ghost
I go insane, She in my brain
She must be tamed, it ain’t my job, but I’m in love

And that’s a curse and it hurts
They say it’s better for the worst
I am around her she gone flirt

My money be going down
Give it all to her she proud
Think she got me feeling sound

Now the people make you think that the money is insane
And it keeps you in your lane, and it makes you start to gain
But once the racks started coming in i felt the same
That i was empty all inside (all inside)

And I put the Wraith in park and ran right up the stairs
Got inside the studio and started diggin in my hair
Tryna find the best lines to make all of this be fair
Yeah I’m pretty fortunate but the victories ain’t there

I wanna live right now
And I’m tired of the pain, they be hittin me right now
She down to hang right now
Right after i glowed up and the $’s comin in right now

And now I’m flying
I see you lying
Don’t mess with me not more
Please no

{Pre- Chorus}
(Los Angeles girls, Los Angeles girls
I ever need you, and you be on my brain
Yeah)

{Chorus}
Los Angeles girls , They be trapping in my hood
They be going for my wood, And they made me understood
That these girls are all lying, And they love it when your dying
Keep you talkin till you tryin, When your close they leave you crying (Its all fake tho)
Why she coming on so slow? Why she dont wanna go?
Hanging with the rest I’m like a ghost
I go insane, She in my brain
She must be tamed, it ain’t my job, but I’m in love
