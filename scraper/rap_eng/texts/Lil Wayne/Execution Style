And squeeze the trigga like a fat ass

Goodnight i'll let the AK long kiss ya
Muder all ya loved ones but no one will miss ya

Neva gave a fuck, and i don't give a fuck now
Bitch nigga play me wrong
And ima shoot em down
Kill his whole motha fucking family

2 clickers pointed at cha 6 pack
Click, clack
Turn this motha fucka to a rib shack
Exit wounds to the back of ya head
Put the pillow on the barrel
Catch you nappin in bed
Execution is no resolution
21 gun salute, revolution
I could getcha brains for the low
Like i got it from a booster
You pussy in the gun, gonna douche ya
Catch you waking up while you yawning
The nine with the beam
Rise and shine, goodmornin
Spaghetti on ya garments
Pasta your posture
Cook em like a foreman
Crack em like a lobster
Pop star, mop em
Stand on top of em
Point blank range till ya not
Then i pop em
Rock em, drop em

Two hallow tips to ya noggin
Kill em execution style
Nigga no problem

I ain't grow em soft

Neva gave a fuck, and i don't give a fuck now
Bitch nigga play me wrong
And ima shoot em down
Kill his whole motha fucking family
Execution style

I grow it loud
Neva gave a fuck, and i don't give a fuck now
Bitch nigga play me wrong
And ima shoot em down
Kill his whole motha fucking family
Execution style

Somebody, Nobody, Yo Buddy
Nail your head with nobody
Oh I didn't wanna step to me
I'm from the home of the steppers
And no one take time out
I'm like new orleans like weather
Every so devious, mean and mischievous
We all gotta eat
And im the mothafuckin' greediest
Check my previous, im the hardest
They the easiest
They wanna know what Weezy is
And what kinda disease he is
I can't be cured, ya can't cure
Gotta scope and a red beam for when i ain't sure
Peek-a-boo muthafuka i see ya
You a pussy
And i would love to be gonneria
Straight run up in your casa tie up mama-mia
Let her getchu on the phone
Gun will hurt of the ear
I ain't playing right now
No not right now
I'll shot you in your muthafukin smile
Hahaha

I ain't grow em soft
I grow loud
Neva gave a fuck, and i don't give a fuck now
Bitch nigga play me wrong
And ima shoot em down
Kill his whole motha fucking family
Execution style

I ain't grow em soft
I grow it loud
Neva gave a fuck, and i don't give a fuck now
Bitch nigga play me wrong
And ima shoot em down
Kill his whole motha fucking family
Execution style
