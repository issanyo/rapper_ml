[Hook:]
You took a shot, all brick
Had to call the dogs off, they was all on "sick" (Looorrrd)
I rolled the Raw so big, in the car and the fog so thick
Got these brauds so pissed
They want allllll my shit, girl get off my- (Loooorrrd)
Three shots and they all gon' stick
I'm rollin' with an all-star clique

[Verse 1: Church St]
My new tape, too ape
A new week, a new bae
It’s too late for the groom’s sake, Church Street known in a few states (niggaaaaa)
I give em two dates then I Lupe
Tryna fuck some old schoolmates, ‘fore the word get around and they only come around for the coin
I’m too paid and they two-faced
Girls wanna talk, if you cute, I’m a fruitcake
But if not, then I gotta keep it straight witcha
Every Tuesday, I be on the same liquor
Walking out the bank like the main villain
Pockets on Thanksgiving
I drive a Honda and that thang tinted, so they can't see the girl who blaaaaaze in it
When it comes to boys, I'm Asian persuuuuaaaading 'em
Make 'em say my name like my main nigga

[Bridge:]
Oooh I should feel ashamed, but I don't feel a thang
Nah, I don't feel a thang but the painkillers
Yeah, I should feel ashamed, but I don't feel a thang
Nah, I don't feel a thang, nigga!
