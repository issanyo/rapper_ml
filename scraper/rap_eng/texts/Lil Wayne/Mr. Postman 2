[Hook]
I've been standin' here waitin', Mr. Postman
So-o-o patiently
For just a card, or just a letter
Sayin' he's returning home to me, Mr. Postman

[Intro - Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's right darling, aha
Yeah, It's ya baby, baby, ha

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
I got her waitin' on me, she lookin' down the block
She see me walkin' up and she run to the mailbox
She say it feels she's up in a cell block
And I open her cell lock, I'm the (Postman)
Just come to make my mail drop, more masculine than him
I'm nastier than him, I'm passin' her and him
In something faster than them
And then he like, "Damn, there go that bastard again, he the (Postman)"
And she correct him, and I respect her
And he protect her, and she neglect him
And he caress her, and she molest me
He must be weak cuz me, I'm just the (Postman)
And when her man home, I'm the ghostman
Why you think she holdin that pillow close, man?
Why you think she won't open the bathroom door?
She's no whore, she want more of the (Postman)

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Girlfriend snatcher, I don't care if you're attached
If that's her, then that's her
And that's me to smash her
Now she hangin' up her high ass skirt, on the (Postman)
Hehe, yeah baby I got that comeback
I'm at your walls like a thumbtack
So Miss Humpback, I know what to do with all that
Fall back, I'll put you a sinner, in the (Postman)
That's big talk for a little guy
But I'm walkin' without reply
She got her legs up, she tryin' to walk in the sky
She callin' for God, and she callin' on I, she say (Postman)
I'm like, "Yeah baby, I'm right here baby
He's here baby!" She like, "Yeah baby!"
Heres a chain letter and some magazines
Keep it clean, he will never think it was the (Postman)

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Yeah, she love my gangsta, she feel my swagger
I'm there every week just to give her her package
I pick up her bills and I pick up her taxes
You might find a few stamps on your mattress from the (Postman)
She want young holly grove in a envelope
I'm her private note and you ain't gotta know
I'm her fantasy, she always got letters on the canopy
Waiting for the (Postman)
No postal service, I just got my social workin'
And your girl is lurkin', and this world is dirty
And your girl is nervous, to give me head in the convertible
I'm the (Postman)
Yeah, kind and curtious, she love that in me
She love me in her, and I love that plenty
It never fails, sorry homeboy
But you've got mail, I'm the (Postman)
