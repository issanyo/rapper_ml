[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
She got that good good she Michael Jackson bad I'm attracted to her wit her attractive ass
She got that good good she Michael Jackson bad I'm attracted to her

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She a monster, I’m her sponsor
She run through my head, Chris Johnson
I’ma tackle her, get in back of her
Bust that open suck that pussy like the Dracula
What your man doing? Tell him fall back
Throw that pussy at me, baseball bat
I kiss her where she point
I make her lose her voice
I see her when I want, call that viewers choice
Number one lover, she want none other
Don't need another one when we got one another
I take her out and then I take her down
I beat it up twelve rounds

[Bridge]

[Hook: Lil Twist]
Ok I’m watching you baby
And thinking about all of the things that I can do baby
On top of the world when I'm on top of you baby
Spend the night with me and get popular baby, po-popular baby (x2)

[Verse 2:Lil Wayne]
Uh
She a monster,but im a beast though
Take her clothes off, with my teeth though
I beat slow or I can hit it fast
I do it how she ask, and I cum last
I bust her ass, we tear it down
Then I gotta split like James Brown
Its all love, I come back around
And if she back it up, then then I back it down
Tell me something is you ready for me baby
Take this beast up out my pants and let you pet it for me baby
My dick on professor Klump jump on this Eddie for me baby
And when you fuck with me they give you credit for it baby yeah

[Bridge]

[Hook]


[Verse 3:Lil Wayne ]
She got that good good she Michael Jackson bad
Im attracted to her for her atractive ass
So pack your bags, I fly you in
Soon as she land, we get it in
She love to put her legs around my neck
I promise if I fuck her harder she gon' choke me to death ha
And its always wet, don't know if she the best I ever had
But she's the best I had yet

[Hook]
