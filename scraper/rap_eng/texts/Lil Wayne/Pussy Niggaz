[Lil Wayne]
Girl from Atlanta and she thicker than her mother
Like her mother, like my mother, and I love her like my mother
Say wussuper like I come from the Bay
But I come from the game where we dont play
504 NOLA,Everyday
Fuck what you say is what chu do
And I do it big,Bigger than you
Try humong,Dont forget da u s
Best flow goin,And everybody know it
I sip syrup and show the pinky ring as I pour it
Just like a poet I wear glasses and the hat
But you dont want me to go back to wearing masks and a gat
I ain't dancing in the back cause in my pants there is a mack
So if you wanna dance with me you gonna be dancing with the mack
And it moves to its own beat,BratBratBratBapdatdedat BratBratBratdedatyBapdedadydatdat BratBratBrat BratBratBratbapbddddd bdddditlle blahadplahadaghayagagaga bedalatbedlatbedle dat dat
Den splat,Ewww
I'm right back at ya just like that
Just like I left sumthin,Weezy F sumthin that you ain't
Like paint Im up on your girlfriend wall
And boy you pussy like your girlfriend draws
Ooh, Im hot, look at summer in the face
And you can count on me like I got numbers on my face
9 on my hip,Yea I got numbers on my waist
And if your girl is a veggie,I put cucumber in her face
Cause DJ on the beat,Lil Weezy with the heat
Forget Shaquille O'Neal I think that D.Wade need me
Man I just went so hard and I dont even know what this song is called
But chu know how niggas say dey ripped it?
Well I just ripped it all
