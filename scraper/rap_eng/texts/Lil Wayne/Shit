[Hook]
Sorry for the wait nigga
Glock forty for them fake niggas
Throw a party every day nigga
That's an ordinary day nigga
Bad bitch in mi casa
No mi casa is su casa
My choppa go doom-da-da ay-ay-adda

[Verse 1]
Tunchi bitch on my Future shit
I'm too legit I sleep on a crucifix
I wake up cranky turn into a lunatic
Then shoot my bitch and buy orange juice and grits
Oozie clip I need another oozie clip
I shoot to kill these pussy niggas shooting bricks
I'm too for real your head just a souvenir
She want to get it off her chest but her boobs too big
I'm bumping Carter V on an Ipod
My bitch mad as hell cause it ain't out yet
She said "soon as these niggas hear your new shit they gon' have to give their styles back"
I say "you too crazy" she said "you too humble"
I say "you too baby" she said "you too sweet"
Then I ask do she go both ways
She said "they do say love is a two way street"
I say ooh
Talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty talk dirty to me
Treat that girl like cuisine she gon' want to shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum I gon' die on my feet
Never knees in the dirt never dirt on my knees
I'm just serving these fiends
I sell birds to the bees I sell birds to the trees
"Tune I heard you don't sleep" I'm allergic to dreams
I don't twerk but I tweak for that purp for that pink
Ya you see what I'm saying like you heard what I see
I'm a verbal disease I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets since my curtains were sheets
Chefs on these beats I'm just stiring the grease
That bitch you in love when she working for me
I personally get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my two fingers I'm at peace
Word I smirk when I squeeze
Trigger smart street smart I'm a nerd I'm a geek
I'm absurd I'm unique
Did my time at Cash Money time served and release
But this agent ain't free word
That's just word on these streets
But that shit is old news that shit yester-week
I'm just focused, focused on my expertise
They like "Tunechi you good" I'm like Bob yes sire
Don't, I mean don't, don't question me let me breath
Dawg, big dawg, I cock back and shoot at your fleas
Money long tree trunk, now stand under me catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees but repeat what you heard you a dead parakeet
This Tunechi bitch your bitch Tunechi's bitch
I fuck her on the balcony we watch the moon eclipse
We do the usual shit she gon' need lube for this
Cause I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world she like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant
She doing lines like a movie script
But these are true events lord
I'll kill a nigga right now, I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put a nigga's body in an ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than, these niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up to the skyline
Thinking to myself you only live twice slime
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place where the high crime rate Iran
We put your ass on nigthtline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline but they never try mine
Spinning like I'm sipping cyanide
Why my bitch sipping Mai Tai but she wine fine
And I'm so sorry she said don't be sorry
Then she said don't apologize for shit cause you the shit and we know the Carter V the shit

[Hook]
