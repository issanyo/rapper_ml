[Intro: Robin Thicke & Lil Wayne]
All night long I wait

Yeah, hey mama

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Kick him out the bed, I'm comin' over
Something to show ya, behold ya eyes
I's wanna hold ya, just hold ya tight
Like a four-leaf clover, I be goin' through
Your flowers, baby, your garden's open
A sight for sore eyes, good Lord I'm focused
Can hardly notice anything other than the woman with the face of my future baby mother

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
I'm a big man, she's a big girl
Put on them heels, and put on that skirt
We can get naughty, we can get bad
She's a good girl with a good girl dance
I'm ice cream, she's a hot swirl
We can get married and live in our world
Let's play rough, we can get wild
I can go home but I'll stay, cheat but I want

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
So I go by Weezy, love me or leave me
I hate to leave her, I think I need her
She's such a teaser, such a diva
Park it right here, baby, fuck it if you need her
Throw it to me, baby, I can be ya receiver
Call me in the last minute, I can be ya reliever
Call me at the last minute, I can be there even
Late night, early morning or maybe this evening

[Verse 4: Robin Thicke]
She ain't no stunt, she ain't no filly
I wanna get mad but then not really
She's so fly, I could get mine
But I do it much better with her by my side
Love is alright, we gon' get blitzed tonight
All my girls wanna make that money
All my girls wanna take that money
All night long I'ma milk that honey

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
All night long I wait for your lovin', babe
All night long I wait to take you to pieces
All night long I wait for you lovin', babe

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
All night long I wait, to see you, babe
And watch the sun rise in your face
All night long I wait for you to play
And let my open arms take you away

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
She say she wanna be the one I get next to, yes, boo
Let's do that, who that? You, that's you
The one I wanna get next to, let's move
Get you to the crib
Now I see you as the one I wanna give sex to, sex you
Sexy you, you sexy devil, you
Angel, lookin' like ya single
Thank you, have yourself a drink
I drink too, saw you when I came through
Can't do, nothin' if it ain't you
It's Wayne, boo, I don't do what them lames do
I come at you from a whole other angle
Now one time for the ladies in the high skirts
Two times for the ladies in the tight jeans
Three times for the ladies who ain't' got no panties on, let's go home

[Chorus]
