[Verse 1: Pharrell]
You can catch me riding down on the fucking Verrazano
Ass out just like Diallo Diablo
Hi-ho silver, call that motherfucker Tonto
Leave a smoke trail back in Jersey in my condo
You can run up like you're Rambo
But you better hit me nigga if you know what I know
Cause I got some supersize guys that'll hit you with a combo
Pronto, you won't see the morning like Alonzo

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Camo shorts no socks with the red Bapes
Walk in to my closet fuck around and get a headache
Fuck you so good shawty you gonna need a bed break
Red viper slither through the street like a red snake
Red diamonds in my chain looking like a red snake
Fuck with me wrong man, you gonna need some yellow tape
"All them awards, Wayne, do you need a medal case?"

[Refrain: Pharrell]
You got that mean mug grill, that red in your eyes
That ace of spades baby talking big-boy size
Get a stack in each hand and hold it like you're fresh
They say man it's like that
Say yes nigga, yes nigga, yes
Your money and your girls, chilling in the VIP
Stop for a second and gyrate them hips
Get a stack in each hand and hold it like your fresh
If they say man it's like that
Say yes nigga, yes nigga, yes

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yes I make money, I'm a paper machine
And you can catch me in the newest, not the latest machine
"Now, Weezy, why you drive so fast?" Because I'm chasing a dream
And when I catch that motherfucker, I'm a rape it and leave
Yea, Its Young Tunechi, now give me some pussy
I ain't gotta paper chase 'cause my paper come to me
I know money look good
Bitch I know that why you looking huh
Riding by myself in that all-red Enzo
Smoke make it look like I got tinted windows
Young Money, bitch, but for short it's YM, ho
Love that shit so much I went and iced out the symbol
All my niggas scaring you, all your nigga's scarier
Scarier than a cat in a cage with a terrier
Pet cemetery, Wayne, are you the veterinarian?

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Yes I do it big, call me Lil Astronomical
Weezy F baby and the 'F' is for phenomenal
Type of nigga go and get his hood 'cross his abdominal
You could check my watch, I been rich a long time ago
I'm so tired of balling, man, I sleep all night
Bed sheets so nice, bed bugs don't bite
I ask her do she wanna fuck, before I ask twice, she say
Yes I am a beast, I swear I needs to be tranquilized
Yes I am a giant, next to me you are just ankle high
Yes I eat that pussy, oh, how do I love that panty pie
Keep my hair shampooed and yes, I keep my hands sanitized
New Orleans baller, ask ESPN
Just kicking it with the Bruce Lee-esbian
"Do you really think you're better than the rest?"
Haha, bitch, I'm the best
