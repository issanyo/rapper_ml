09, we tote; my niggas ain’t no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don’t get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked

[Lil Mouse]
Corlay RIP him, Darnell RIP him
If you disrespect them, then you gone meet them
My niggas rollin for for features; that bitch going, she a eater
She was a good girl, I turned her to a eater
Hit squad [?], yea nigga
.30 clip and them hollow tips make him do the running man
Glock 40 I’m tuckin it; I’m rolling with my hitters
I’ll send my hitters out to go get you
Hella bands, hella bands, hit the club throwing hella bands
Heavy load, throwing hella bands, in the club doing the money dance
Hella bands, hella bands, hit the club throwing hella bands
Heavy load, throwing hella bands, in the club doing the money dance
Niggas talking shit in the club, he better watch his self
Melly got the .30 on his hip, he gone need some help
I’m a gangster, nigga, and I could do this shit my fucking self
Pistol hit his melon; it ain’t gone be nothing left

09, we tote; my niggas ain’t no joke

Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked

[Lil Wayne]
Runnin around with my gangstas, Runnin up in these yellow hoes
Everybody wanna fuck my bitch, her pussy lips like heaven doors
It’s pussy, money, and kush
Skateboards and shrooms
These niggas think they the shit
These niggas perfume
Hollygrove, so Hollygrove, all I know is Hollygrove
I’m sick with it, I’ve been diagnosed
We don’t cut the coke, that’s diet coke
These niggas broke, I’m paid in full
Blood gang, Red Bull
My tounge is like a surf board, and her pussy is like a wave pool
Tunechi!

[Hook (x2)]
