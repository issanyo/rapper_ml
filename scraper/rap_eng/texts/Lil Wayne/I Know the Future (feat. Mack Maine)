Young money mothaf**ka
Uhh huh
Thats right
Now dont you know
Ima beast
Eastside
Up in tha beat

||Verse 1||
Straight from the bottom of the cut
I give it to these bitch niggas like momma taught me
One man with no weopon at war, but im an army
My flow is capital attention lieutenant your penit pension
And they demolished that invention
You better get your dollars up
And guess what, i was up
I get my cheese like mickey mouse
Or else you better donald duck
Like a shooting range target
I get all kinda bucks
Be my shooting range target
Nigga i got good luck
Nigga bye bye good luck
Got your momma shook up
Lil bad ass nigga, who thought popeye wasn't tough
Im on that lala twist it up
Im on that syrup slow it down
And i like four freeks too, and i ain't young jock but its going down
I buy that marijuana field, then i just smoke it down
Big bad wolf yes i just blow it down
No homo and to holly grove i will hold it down
Like a circle of knives i got the sharpest flow around

||Chorus||
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know they can't f**k with me cuz im da center of tha world)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)

Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know they can't f**k with me cuz im da center of tha world)

||Verse 2||
Bitch im Mack Maine
I got tha heart of a king, blood of a slave
Feel like i been there before, my second time to the grave
But its one life to live, thats why im gettin paid
Off a flow thats priceless, i just got it appraised
Spit like i need a raise
Blaze as i gaze, at the stars and ask the lord
Why the culprit at the pall pit
It make me sick to my stomach
Thats why i rap, like a pregnant woman i dont spit i vomit
So pay homage me and wayne two G's
Like twenty hundreds
And we keep the semi's blunted
And we live like brothas from anotha
So f**k with him and mack gonna react like you did me something
Thats a hint to you David
Throwin shots at Goliath
This the new testament, where the victor is tha giant
So you should get your way and lose the hate
Remember males shouldn't be jealous, thats a females trait

||Chorus||
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know they can't f**k with me cuz im da center of tha world)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know)
Future(I know they can't f**k with me cuz im da center of tha world)
