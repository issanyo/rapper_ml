[Intro]
Every-time on Instagram, Twitter, or Soundcloud
I always have rappers follow me because I only release one song
I'm not destined to be a rapper
I love rapping, but since everyone, rappers specifically
Only want to hear rap music from me, then fuck it
Might as well have something for you

[Chorus]
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
That's all you rap about
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Yeah, fuck yeah
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Yeah, yeah
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga (what the fuck!)

[Verse 1]
I don't know what the fuck you're following me for
If you wanna hear a rapper then go to the god dang store
I'm not the one that you want
I'm not the one that you need
In fact, all you stupid bitches are the reason that I changed my feed
I'm sick of having the rappers follow me, and unfollow me
After an hour, it's making me sour
I thought I made it very clear
That before you wanna fuck with me, you better go through my feed, boi
If you wanna roll with me
I'm just a dumb-ass kid tryna reach his dreams
If you can't see that, proudly get the fuck outta my kingdom, man
I'm done with this bullshit man
I think it's best to keep my shit private man
Cause I'm all about the music
But I'm also here to diss and that, and this and this
So before you wanna listen to me, or check me out
Please have time to listen to this

[Chorus]
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
That's all you rap about
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Yeah, fuck yeah
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Yeah, yeah
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga (what the fuck!)

[Verse 2]
Hey, but really
Why you wanna waste my time
Even when you know that I'm gonna waste yours
I'm not cool, or hot, or amazing
In fact, I don't call myself anything
Yet y'all fuckers keep tripping
Understand that I wanna be a rapper
That's the rule, by demand
A piece of hesitation
Because you fuckers keep following, and then you unfollowing
Next time you wanna fuck with a chink, think twice
Boy you one that's lemme see you sing
All you fuckers, I'm done
I'm going back to square one
If you wanna see or hear from me again
Then you better call my secretary, or me
On line one
I know you're gonna be on the run
Cause you're a little snitch, you better find a shovel and dig a ditch
Because if you follow me now
I'm gonna have to find and kill you
Motherfuckin stupid bitch

[Chorus]
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
That's all you rap about
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga (oh my god)
Yeah, fuck yeah
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Yeah, yeah
Pussy, money, weed, nigga
Pussy, money, weed, nigga (i'm satanic)
Pussy, money, weed, nigga

[Outro]
Rap music, yeah
Disrespect your parents
Two clowns in a tiny car
Fuck it man
What, hey
God ruoy toohs dna stnerap ruoy llik
