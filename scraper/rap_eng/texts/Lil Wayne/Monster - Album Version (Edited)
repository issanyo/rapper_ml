Im jus' the recipe so you can save the garlic
Im like a set of keys Im 'bout to get it started
I smoke 'dem Beverly Hills from California
'Dem bitches after me so I put that paddle on 'em
She rode my dick and said she shoulda put a saddle on 'em
I watch out for 'dem snakes listen for that rattle homie
And I ain't got a clique I got a cattle homie
Wud up five kickin' back jus' bein' booL
Im talkin' foreign money like a European dude

Reup, we up in the club we up in the club
Money runnin' like water bitch get up in the tub

Now she can't leave so we fuck in the club
Am I lucky or what Playboy Rabbit
And I like big tongues like skateboard fashion
I got more gurls than the Playboy Mansion
I bet I serve 'em up like my name Pete Samprace
And a nigga drink like the late Fred Sandford
And a nigga smoke like there is no cancer
And I know this world is so cold and decievin'
But I keep my head up like my nose is bleedin'
Yeah, and until that chosen evenin'

Hollygrove 17 I won't leave you
Nope, and this is just the preview
But I'm already workin on the sequel
Fuck wit' me wrong I'll fuck wit' yo home
Like a letter to the wife sayin' ya husband is gone
Like Muslim Im calm but like Muslim I'll bomb
And beat the track up like a hundred arms
Im funky like underarms
The engineers recordin a thunderstorm
My hunger forms then ring the alarms
The Carter 2 was nice but the third times a charm

[Outro:]
Weezy Fuckin' Baby
