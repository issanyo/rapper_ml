Nigga i'm young as a muhfucka
But money a muhfucka
Young money muthafucka, get it in blood puddles
Shit, i'm in the south but we living in mud puddles
Shit is a drug stuggle when you niggas upping prices
I hug the Glock like a turn buckle
Can't get stop by the vices, no license
Rolling like dices on the street
Where the eyeses hide
Where the crime is life
And the life is time, and the time is jail
And in the jail you stressin
The judge probley hit me with an algebraic expression
But I get away free like oceans elevan
And i'm motioned to meddle, like a pro-fe-ssional
And when i;m rolling expecially like a pimp suppose to
Watch how you sit down somethings in that sofa
If she with me, you know theres something in that ho bra
She's a foreigner so she say coca
I get broke off and they get brok-er
They like so what, i'm like so when?
We going know then how the turn in turn out
Cause we going shoot back till the burners burn out
Till the burning burn down every house the block hold
I'm hollering at you niggas with every shot the Glock hold
You can't see me there's a thousand blind folds
And my mind state just put a thousand on top of those
Chea, I do school and do lunch at popadoes
They want beef I'll turn to that to sloppy joes
Copy cats brrrrrrat, copy those
Had a strong relationshp with expensive cloths
This stuntin shit is expensive and intense
Like pulling up in something Americans can't invent
Chea, I make them fall back, they gotta indent
Like a paragraph, the first sentence, shit
Im way smarter man, im more gifted
Straight from the womb to pro, prolific
Im so im so so lifted, high in the sky
Me and pops taking pictures
Thats my vision and untill my vision
Is vivid ima give it all I got we good jigga you bitches
