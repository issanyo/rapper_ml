[Intro:]
It's be Gizzle (Heard me)
(Cut the music up, Ya that's good)
Too Hood 2 Be Hollywood (Bust something, shoot something)
One of the realest niggas that ever done it
Right chyea, live and in living color
(get em)

[Verse 1: B.G.]
It's like B. Gizzle, the world wide ghetto pass
I'm reppin nigga, take a flight to the motherland
I fear God only, never fear another man
It's never one hustle, I always got a backup plan
It ain't no secret I can tell ya bout the gutta man
I'm a write a book on how to come out the struggle man
Now come through, you know what's in them dufflebags
A lot of gats, a lot of cash, and some ski masks
You know my street pass, it been certified
Stop lying I'm a g you been heard about
Stop repping, you a pussy I been heard of you
You playin with a gangsta homie the nerve of you
Oh you lookin for me, but the homie lookin for you
Have yo people wearing a rest in peace shirt of you
My reputation on the block been A-1
I'm the same N.O. nigga I been since day

[Chorus: Lil Wayne (Trey Songz)]
I said bust somethin, shoot somethin
You just talking I know you ain't gon do nothin
Pussy nigga (ya heard me?)
If you got something to lose
You gon lose something unless you do something
So (ya heard me?)
Gotta use what you've learned, in order to receive what you've earned
Make sure (ya heard me)
Real niggas do real things so recognize real niggas in the game
I know you heard me
You say (ya heard me), I say (ya heard me), He say (ya heard me)
I know you heard me, she say (ya heard me)
Everybody like it when I say (ya heard me)

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
You got a lot of nerve
They talkin alot. I heard
Only round yo homies, when I'm round you know, not a word
I'm a heathen who fight for what he believes in
And I don't have no plans on leaving till I get even
Salt and pepper, nigga I'm seasoned for any reason
The day you want something with Juve, come on and see him
My G ain't gon allow me to lose
I'm busting shots as soon as you make a move
Oooh, I'm not a fan of fools that's why I got attitude
Runnin your mouth to me, I'm a try to get at a dude
Don't even have a tool, what is you tryna prove
Gon head and choose ya [? ], cause I'm a shoot

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
N.O. on my fitted, I'm committed to my city
Anything I will commit it just to show that I'm committed
Commit it then get acquitted
Aye Gizzle let me get em, Gizzle let me get em
Eat em up and shit em (ha)
And ain't no explanation for this damn insanity
I'm a monster like I'm part of the Addams Family
And some say I am old, but I'm new to a few
And I'm blessed... achoo
I came to get me and I got you
And I'm so me and I'm not you
And even if you get married you could'nt do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals
Life's a gamble...

[Chorus]
