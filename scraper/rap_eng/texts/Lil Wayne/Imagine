That mean I'm ballin' bitch
If ya didn't know, if you wasn't informed
Or somethin' like that, this is Da Drought 3
And um, check this out
Yeah, imagine wakin' up out ya, sleep to them pistols blastin'
And if the witness is dead there's no trial
If you didn't know then, hoe, well ya know now
And I don't mean basketball, when I say I don't know Yao
Money money money money, boost my morale
Play with my money money money, okay coral
I like a bitch with a Apple Bottom, like Vokal
The top is at my fingertips, like I ain't got no nails
I got blood brothers, bitch, I ain't got no pals
I make a girl get low, like I ain't got no L's
I'ma paper chasin' dog, check my toenails
And I never miss a game, no Shaq O'Neal
More like Brett Favre, just like Brett Favre
I been shot two times, just wipe that off
But I thank you for puttin' me right back, Lord
And to you, Father, I would give my life back for it
That knife, that sword, that gun, that war
Make ya so called soldiers, just run like Gore
Yeah, Frank that is from San Francis
And I got more banana clips than chimpanzees
10 addresses and I dresses
Like I thinks I'm the muthafuckin' best there is
And I'm about to bubble and she catch that fizz
And I'm straight from Clayborne, nigga, just ask Liz
Check ya neck, there ain't a crook like this
From the city where the judge throw the book at kids
Burna in school, in my book bag hid
Talk stupid at lunch and we havin' ya ribs
If you are not home, then we havin' ya kids
And if you can't come up with half, I'll send ya half of ya kid
Back to the board, an extravagant crib
I'm on the toilet watchin' Martin, just laughin' and shit
Don't know why I get high, but I get high
I get high like every single day
We do shit that them other women can't
Mary Jane, what is it you've done to me?
I pop a beat and start rollin'
And then I smoke it like a muthafuckin' stogie
Pete Pye wrote it, I was rappin' to the
Ding-ding-ding-ding, fuck it
Get high, screw the world and that's that
I need all my funds, yeah, all my money, baby
Black diamonds and pearls, believe that
I may bling bling and my chest look like a mural
I'm nuts, just call me Squirrel
My fetish is the girls but the women not the girls
Act your age, not your shoe size, maybe we can do the twirl
I'll be the Prince of a Pearl, tongue, earring in her pearl, tongue
If she come let her girl come, give her a pill, giver her girl, one
Party time, excellent, yup Wayne's World
Campbell's soup on the wrist, just call me Earl
Lil' ma don't shoot 'em, ya heard
I get high my words slur, I start callin' 'em Mirl
Hey Mirl, light that fur
And I know this old, but I'm really hot in hurr
I went with the phantom, my niggas coppin' the spurs
My hands in the pot, I'd rather eat and stir
It's I against the world and I'm strapped, yeah
I bring all my guns, shoot mothers, fathers, babies, damn
Black hand guns to serve, we could see
But we are so blind to the signs, they tryin' to lose the world
And we will walk right up with our guns
Yup, hand in hand, yeah
We'll march right after the drum
But I don't need no band
