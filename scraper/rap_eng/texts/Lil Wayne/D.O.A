[Verse 1]
Fiji water, grandaddy purp
Excuse me, I let the semi-automatic burp
Blood gang mothafucka, call me Red Alert
Young Carter kill in order, who get it first
Stuff that girl with dick 'til her head burst
Young Weezle flow needles, I can thread shirts
Boy you ain’t did shit, I done said worse
Flip your fitted cap back like Fred Durst
Fiji water, OG kush
Yeah, I drink verses and eat hooks
Got the stove on my waist, and we cooks
I'm in the way, you can’t pass, like Aaron Brooks
President, ride the car slow
I let my driver drive, I'm on par 4
Spit hanging from my mouth, retard flow
And I say what I won like an award show
I'm on some shit ain’t even came out the ass yet
Sit back and watch the green grow like the grass wet
Young or old, there ain’t no comparin' me
I just cleared that up, moment of clarity

[Verse 2]
I'm about to go almonds
Young head buster, get your helmets
You niggas real soft, what is that, velvet?
I get big chips, you get Alvins
I'm about to go walnuts
We get 7-digit money, you could call us
Hit 'em with the chopper, watch 'em ball up
Paint your face red, you all dolled up
Yeah, Young Nino, nigga
Do it for my team, Tim Tebow, nigga
I'm killin' this shit, Grim Reap' flow, nigga
Gettin' swallowed by the Maybach, deep throat, nigga!
I'm about to go Planters
I’m still in my prime, Deion Sanders
We all gamblers, I will not lose
Flow precious as diamonds, I drop jewels
Give me mine or I'mma take mine
Smoking purple, I heard it through the grape vine
Weezy Baby, AKA Your Highness
I just killed this shit, moment of silence

[Interlude]
But I ain't finished, uh-uh
No Ceilings motherfucker! Yeah

[Verse 3]
I'm in the zone like a fastball
And I fuck the game up like a bad call
Let the money stack, don’t let the cash fall
Bars all day, no last call
I'm in the Red Zone nigga
Wake up in the morning with your head gone nigga
Birdman Jr., wings spread on niggas
Leave the beef in the streets and bring the bread home nigga
Yeah, tell the doctor "Step aside, please"
Dr. Carter got some lean in your IVs
Strong dry weed, make my eyes bleed
Strong arm rap, I rock an iron sleeve
I'm in the zone like the secondary
No lie bitch I’m flyer than a pet canary
I’m a dog on the beat, fuck the veterinary
Two women praise me like Mary Mary
I'm in the zone like college ball
Spit fire like I’m sipping on a Molotov
Loose bowels, this shit is so easy
(I might send this to The Mixtape Weezy)
