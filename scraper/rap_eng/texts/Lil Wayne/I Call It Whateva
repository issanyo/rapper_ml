[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Hey!
Look up baby, they write my name in the sky bitch
Don't forget the baby is what I tell her prolly
Don't forget the liquor store is what I tell the driver
Twenty dutch masters and straight level vodka
I can pedal backwards and still move forwad
Look under the matress, you might find four of 'em
I can go though the atlas without tourin'
I can fuck an actress and never been in movies, chea
I'm a cutie
An offspring of mamas beauty
I did overtime, I took papas duty
I'm a man in every sense, I got sense
Since I got rich, I got tents on every Bent
Since I know tension come out them like vents
I vent, and show no relent, money well spent
I'm a hell raiser, blaze a L
Right in front of the laws
I'm tougher than ya'll
Never really had a pop, so I never had to check in
But I get enough checks, I fuck around and check him
Look, check him out, these is Evisus
America ain't even let them out (ha ha)
I'm feeling great, I'm steppin' out
Take ten out
Brrraagh, chest is out
And I don't leave parapaliegics
I squeeze it
Until I see your spirit rise with my own eyes nigga
I'm on mine nigga
I got this like a bitch got time nigga
And I'm the dime type
And I'm walkin' in the lime light, still like lime
They talkin' in hinesight, I'm right now
I pull up on your shawty like SKRT
Tryna hop up in this Maybach, I walk way back girl
Come up out that gear asap girl
Whisper in your ear thats Wayne pussy, say it back girl
Now she in th whip wit homes
He listenin the same songs I fucked her on, yea
I lay back, I'm comfortable, yea
Weezy baby boy, lazy boy, yea
I did my service in the Navy
Now I'm just a veteran, they forever pay me
Dig me like a shovel
Mama I'm a rebel
I come from under that rock and turned into a pebble
Baby I'm trouble, so turn up the treble
You say it's clever
I call it whateva
