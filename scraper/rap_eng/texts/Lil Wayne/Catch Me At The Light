[Intro]
It's Sha-motherf-nell, yeah, Yo Gotti
Ohh-whoaaa, ohhh, yeah

[Hook]
Catch me at the light
When you see me rolling
You ain't got a fast car
Might as well keep going
Catch me at the light
And you better be riding right
With the suicide doors on the side
Catch me at the light (the light)
I see you creeping up
If you want some conversation
Speed it up
Catch me at the light
Catch me at the light
Buckle up let me take you on a ride

[Verse 1]
Pull up top back I'm back
Drop top's got me feeling so alive oh yeah
In my new thing paint all black
Whips game got the haters hit the ties oh yeah
I got 200 on the dash
Looking like I'm flying in a space ship
Nothin' to play with
Cause if I'm talking to a man
He be right like me me

[Pre-Hook]
If you're a maserati roller
Bentley and your holding
Looking like a Benz or a Beamer when you're rollin
Jaguar elise show me you can keep up with me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Green light don't look back
Please don't let me beat you off the line
I don't mind
If you can keep up that's what's up
Competition is so hard to find to find
Cause when the traffic is thick
We swerving pass em so quick
We bent corners
Benihana in matching type whips
Off the freeway we go
That I know you can spend a couple dollars
On a body boy you whip it so exotic

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]
(Repeat 2X)
