[Intro]
Young Weezy Baby!
Aagghhhwooo!

She got her bags by the door nob
OK be cool wait baby slow down
Don't walk out of that door
Ooh
I done made her past mad now
Her tears falling from her pouring on the ground
I ain't never seen her like this before..no
Now I'm feel like I'm falling
No one here to save me
I don't wanna die alone
I don't wanna live alone
Hang Into This Shyt Together
We Gon Leave This Shyt Together

I Dont Wanna Live No More
Self Destruction

Self Destruction
I Dont Wanna Live No More Without U!
Yea Its A Suicidal

U Might See Me On The Side Of The Road
Keep Driving
You May See Me Jumping Into The Road
Keep Driving
Im Just Tryna Find The End Of The Road
Ok I Think Im Gonna Have To Send Her A Note
Along With A Rose
And That Rose Will Be Black
And That Note Attached Shall Read
"Im Gone"
"Honey Im Gone"
"I'd Rafter Be With God Before I Be Alone"
So From Heaven I Sing This Song
O Yea "P.S. Honey Im Home"

And The Angels Even Look And Smell Like You
But There's No Angel Or Gal Like You
Man I Fucked Up (Man I Fucked Up)
Yaah I Fucked Up (Yaah I Fucked Up)

And Now She Gone
And Thats Fucked Up

[Chorus:]
And Now Im Headed For Self Destruction

For You I'll Cry
And If I Can't Have You
