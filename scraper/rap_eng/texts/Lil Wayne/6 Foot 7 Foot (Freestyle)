Ok lets keep it real I'm only 5'7
If I stand up on my bars I'm tall enough to get to heaven
I'm straight from Baltimore thats why my life is like a gun show
But I'm so hot I could be Ethiopian, Lola Monroe
Said they was looking for me like a daddy up on Maury
And they Carmen Sandiago, I mean where in the world are they
I mean I just be everywhere is it my fault that your never there
I dare them, and I swear they'll be like hair right after Nair
They call me Serena cuz I hit chickens like they brain balls
You dont bust nothing that ain't blue you got green balls
Play with me I'm in your chest just like a hiccup
Go harder than a 40 year old virgin at a strip club
Ask Angel Baby , and AJ if I  stack attack
Cuz every time I spit it it's a mutha -F'n rap attack
