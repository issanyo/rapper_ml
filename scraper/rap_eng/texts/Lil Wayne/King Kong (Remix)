[Jibbs:]
Ay Yo This Beat Is Bannanas
Gave King Kong A Tree And Put'em In The Trunk Of Da Mcclaren
So When The Doors Lift Up They Fall Off
Take A Look At My Ride You See The Doors Is All Off
Plus The Wheels Look Flat, Trunk So Heavy In The Back
Got The Speakers In The Front And They Be Sittin On My Lap
Got The Bumpers To The Ground
Cause The Trunk Weighin It Down
They Think It's A Low Rider When They Come From Outta Town
And That's Cause King Kong In The Trunk
Plus The Gorillas Behind Me
So When I'm Commin Thru Yo Hood Anybody Can Find Me
You Can Hear Me From The Next Block
When I'm On The Next Block, When I'm Headed To The Next Block
So Jump Into The Next Block

[Hook:]

[Chamillionaire:]
