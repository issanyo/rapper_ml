[Keri Hilson]
You fly as hell swagga right, brown skin poppin'
You know just how to talk to me, know just how I like it
You turnin' me on, you turnin' me on, you turnin' me on

Now wait a minute little buster
You got one more time to feel on my booty
Better recognize a lady that ain't the way you do me

You turnin' me off, you turnin' me off
You turnin' me off
Better recognize a real woman

(Ahh)
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin' me
Dime divas give it to me

(Ahh)
I gotta be feelin' your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me
Recognize a real woman

Goin' up on it, you actin' like you want it
And you stuntin' like your daddy, checkin' for this little mama
You turnin' me on, you turnin' me on, you turnin' me on
Now wait a minute little buster

Now you don't even know me but you wanna take me shopping
You a lame, I can tell it ain't big shit poppin'
You turnin' me off, you turnin' me off
You turnin' me off
Better recognize a real woman

All you wanna do is holla at the cutest broad
To get up in them draws, got money, don't try to buy me
Bottles, got my own dollars I could buy up the bar if I want it

(Ahh)
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin me
Dime divas give it to me

(Ahh)
I gotta be feelin' your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me

You ain't never been to Wayne's World

I do my thing now you're in love with an alien
Polow on the beat and Weezy F I'm at the plate again
Keri if you pitch it at me, I'm a swing away at it
Someone better play the fence
Someone better tell them 'bout me

The only thing you smell around me
Weezy F baby, don't forget the F around me
And if you do then get the F from round me
