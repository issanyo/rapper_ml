[Intro]
See round here you gotta mumble
'Cause these hoes is like dumbo
Boy these hoes is cut throat
Stop talkin' when you cuddle
I be by the plug though
Watchin' Telemundo
Lord knows when it comes to money trees
We gotta jungle, oh Lord

[Verse 1]
I was born there, like Tarzan
Go hard man, like the bar exam
It's so hard to shake these feds off
You'd do better trying to shake the lawyers' hands
Oh Lord, it used to come hand and hand
Now it come on the boat, and the same bitch
That said she gon' lie on the stand
Ain't even coming to court
And the same lawyer that said he gon' do all he can
Do what you can afford
I now I heard the bitch snitchin'
Due to reports, thought she was too cute to report
Lawd, we outchea, ain't that the truth
Just can't catch a break, been trapping so hard
The labor it come with the fruit
And before I bust a grape

[Bridge 1]
I'm trappin' on the low low, Just me and my woe no
But I think the feds got a hunch, like Quasimodo
Reppin' for my logo, that's me and my bro bros
Up in all my photos, with that "Yeah, we know" pose
Trapping out the 4-door, traffic moving so slow
I just come from cholo, cholo got that coco
And my phone bout' to blow though
They looking for that coco
We got them chickens good lord
Yeah we got that pollo

[Pre-Chorus]
I pull the cash out scream Y.O.L.O
To I get a sore throat I scream Y.O.L.O
Niggas come masked up like Zoro
Fucked your bitch on the lean that's a slow poke
Then i'm scoping the scene like a Go Pro
Niggas know what I mean keep it low pro
I just stick and move like a pogo
Then I laugh to the bank, nigga no joke (L.O.L)

[Chorus]
And these niggas showboat with no boat (Yeah)
Me, I got broke for show though (Yeah)
I get that for show dough for sure though (Yeah)
Cause there ain't no dough like mo' dough (L.O.L)
And these niggas showboat with no boat (Yeah)
Me, I got broke for show though (Yeah)
I get that for show dough for sure though (Yeah)
Cause there ain't no dough like mo' dough

[Post-Chorus]
Been trappin' on the low low, Just me and my woe no
Adderall for no doze, cappin' on you poor hoes
Dapper in my polo, trappin' in my polo
Trappin' out a Volvo (Yeah)

[Bridge 2]
I've been trappin' on the low low, Just me and my woe no
But I think the feds got a hunch, like Quasimodo
Snappin' all these photos, tracking down my bro bros
Trappin' with my woe woes (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I've been trappin' on the low low, I don't let my hoe know
All this promethazine, bitch i'm bout' to go pro
Reppin' for my logo, that's me and my woe woes
Cappin' on the popos, trappin' on you poor hoes (Yeah)
That's me and my woe woes (Yeah)
Trappin' on you broke hoes (Yeah)
That's me and my woe woes (Yeah)
Trappin' on the low low

[Bridge 3]
I've been trappin' on the low low, just me and my woe no
But I think the feds got a hunch, like Quasimodo
Snappin' all these photos, tracking down my bro bros
Trappin' with my woe woes (Yeah)
Trappin' on the low low (Yeah)
Just me and my woe no, I think the feds got a hunch
Talking to all my bro bros, snappin' all these photos
That's that "Yeah, I know" pose
But they don't know

[Outro]
Trappin' on the low low, just me and my woe no
But I think the feds got a hunch (I think the feds got a hunch)
That's that "Yeah, I know" pose
But they don't know
