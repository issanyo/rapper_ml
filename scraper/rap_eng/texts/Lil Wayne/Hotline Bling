[Intro]
I used to
I used to
Used to

[Chorus 1]
I used to call you from the jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
I used to call her from a jail phone
Every day like she's my plug
I used to call you from the jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
Call her from the jail phone
Every day like she's my plug
And she know when that hotline bling, yeah
To look down at her diamond ring, yeah
I said she know when that hotline bling, yeah
It's time to drop everything

[Verse 1]
But ever since you got them titties you
Talkin' 'bout you thinkin' 'bout some ass shots
Taking all these snapshots, different backdrops
Dancing, posting pics after you cash out
Ever since you got them titties you
Been ignoring my calls and my iMessage
Saying you feel like one of my side bitches
So I pop a molly and I cry with you

[Chorus 2]
I used to call you from a jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
Would call you from a jail phone, hey
Every day like she's my plug
I used to call you from the jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
Call her from a jail phone
Every day like she's my plug
And she know when that hotline bling, huh
Just look at that diamond ring, yeah
She know when that hotline bling, yeah
It's time to drop everything

[Verse 2]
But ever since I left the prison you do you
You never ever try to lock me down
Remember when you used to always hold me down
You used to promise me that you'd be holding out
You used to send me naked pictures too-ooh-ooh-ooh
Now you saying you gettin' older now
Young nigga like me used to show you out
You hangin' in circles you wouldn't go around
Sneaky hoes record me on their cell phone, damn
So everyone can see my love
I used to be your ringtone
I had you listen as the screen lights up

[Bridge]
Every time that hotline bling
You just need some time to think, yeah
Don't care what your friends think
Them bitches want that diamond ring
But ever since you met them bitches
You're a new you, you're a new you
Forgot to tell you I fucked them bitches before I knew you
I guess they forgot too

[Verse 3]
You shouldn't call me from your girl's phone
Cause she ain't gonna delete my number
Press me when she know that you're gone
That bitch is gonna hit me right up
And do I still have my own private ring?
Oh, now you keep your shit on silent ring
Damn, why you think I let you keep your diamond ring?
To remind you of when I was king

[Outro]
I used to call you from the jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
Used to call her from a jail phone
Phone sex 'til it beeps, timeâ€™s up
Girl, talkin' 'bout you thinkin' 'bout some ass shots
Taking beaucoup snapshots, different backdrops
I still fuck that pussy 'til you blackout
Take your tap out, no ceilings
