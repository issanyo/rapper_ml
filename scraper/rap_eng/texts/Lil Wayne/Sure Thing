[Lil Wayne]
Twist made me do this

Kush and a Swisher
Money over bitches
Never kill a woman
Unless she a witness
All about my business
Survival of the Fittest
She let me hide my weed in her titties
Bitch, I got the cash in a rubberband
I got the Glock already cocked, boom!
Fucking with a nigga meet my muthaf-cking goons
Sorry 4 the Wait: Carter IV coming soon
Light it up cause I’ma smoker
She tried to deep throat
I fucked around and choked her
It’s Young Money mutherf-cker game over
Shots leave your body
Looking like you doing yoga
And Lord knows I am a sinner
Pain pills for dinner
Bitch I am getting money
Like I got a money printer
I got a chopper and a trimmer
Shooting like Jimmer
You coming in that water boy
You better be a swimmer
I ain't worrying bout ya’ll
Sitting in my hog
While Miss Anita Baker say you bringing me joy
I came straight outta jail
And did my thing on these boys
And we all yell “fuck you bitch” and kept going
I am on and that’s right baby
I am ain't going out
This bitch without a fight baby
One request: please don’t bite baby
I got some bomb ass pussy from a white lady
I ain't lying, I’mma shine like a nickel or a diamond
I smoke a lot of weed to keep them bitches off of my mind
Girl, stop talking that shit
Gon suck a nigga's dick for a new outfit
And even if the sky come falling
Bitch I’ma still be high
I got faith in my weed man
But lil niggas got yay by the bean bag
Hit ya ass from the side like a screen pass
And that red bandana is the team flag
Yeah, all up in your fucking face
Tez pushed the album back, sorry 4 the wait
