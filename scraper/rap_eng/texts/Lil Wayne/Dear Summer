[Intro]
Yeah, Suffix, people, yeah
You know
You, you, you already
Yeah, come on

[Verse]
Kickin rocks on the block tellin all the OGs
I be coming for your spot when you're not looking
Hot cooking momma got it on the kitchen table
I thank God we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable too
Nintendo when the good grades came through
Then the cooked k's came through
Some soft, some stepped on, but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights
Thought I heard niggas coming, thought I saw the cop lights but
I was dreaming, then I woke, the junkies was still feenin
And I had coke so I had hope u may say that is wrong
But I ain't talkin to ya child I'm talkin to this song
I'm just doing a walk down memory lane
If I crash, just pick up my brain
And yes, my niggas the same, but they quicker to bang
And if they do then I'm the nigga you blame
So I shoot first anyway and I would do the honors anyday
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the state like I whip through the A
Show your ass how to take four and get eight
And it don't take four niggas to get straight
The only hot boy eating off this plate
Young Weezy, baby, that's what ya bitch say
Give her ass a location and a template
Show her how to work the innerstate
Stop working with that thinner weight, get your brakes fixed
Stop playin, cause all we know is gunplay
Trip while you full and my clip gon be empty
When the stomachs get empty anythings tempting
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kid's sake
Hurricane wipe the south like a earthquake
We tryna save face but we ain't got a place
To stay, so they made us evacuate
We on our way, pussies, relocate
Ya'll notice when you see us put your jewels up
Put your cars, put your clothes, put your shoes up
It's that serious, homie, pick the news up
It wasn't good, nigga, think about the hood nigga
The people who ain't never had shi, ain't gon never have shit
Bullshit cause they still gon try to manage niggas doin anything
Like God gon understand them
But please understand us, niggas with money lost mansions
Niggas with nothing lost families, lives lost in traffic
Brought it up to the attic, there goes the stashes
But a nigga got passion
Even though the bounce back seeming like Magic
Shit, but call me Siegfried
Watch how I turn one K to a hundred Gs
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze
Summer, please know I live for ya
Throw on the wifebeater, let back the lid for ya
A few years I prolly hear from ya, but now I'm here for ya
I know niggas that shed a tear for ya
Behind bars tryna get to ya, they prolly never see ya
It's that real talk if you ever heard it, homie
Shit hurt so much might have to hurt ya homie
No commercial, no frontin, no curve on it
No cut, tell life so what
The drought's here, not only white slowed up
The weed slowed up we can't even roll up
Fuck, put it in the money too
But that's the last thing cause hustle is what we do
Hustle with what? How we getting on?
Where he sittin at? What he sittin on?
Stand up if you know it's true
The end of the world cumin and my city the proof, damn
And this is after disaster, this ain't rap, this is recap
Stepping off the G4, still strapped
Bust ya head in the air, that's a sky-cap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies
Birdman, as long as we gon eat
Then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reach
And I'm a get death through these balls, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even
When everything paused, I proceeded
I'm a leader, meet the son of Jacida
Fuck the world, not the people, damn
