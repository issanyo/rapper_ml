[Murda Mil]
These niggas never thought they'd be tha ones that Mil'd shake down
Get a few crack spots, sell that big weight now
But when you ree up you to cut yo cake now
And when you see murder you know you got to break down
Y'all bitch niggas thinkin life is a cut
Now you stuck watchin niggas fuck your wife in tha butt
You was the main thug up in tha club
Now you the main thug sucking a snub
Gettin baptized in your tub
I kick murder every two bars
Pack two tars, when I cock I need two cars
Cause I stuff a trunk like a turkey
Keep a vest on, that deuce deuce ain't gone hurt me
When I get the drop I'll pop while y'all sprayin wit tha calico
Box full of bald heads, got y'all scared
Then hit tha block for Y'all bread
Cause when y'all post up I'm leavin y'all dead
Leavin y'all dead

[Beanie Sigel]
You know Mac, that Philly cat with the official flow
The pistol will blow, especially if your wrist on glow
Rocks in the watch looking like a disco show
Grab the tool-a, put it to tha back of your medulla
Beanie Sigel desert eagle quick to pop off ten
I only carry guns that knock off limbs
Give out colostomy bags, lay on the deck when I spray on your set
Who you know escapin' the Tec without a trach' in they neck
I roll with killers and dealers who be supplying the packs
I'm a guerrilla - but you can catch me where the lions be at
It ain't shit for me to ride out and tie a few cats
Make them show me where they hide out and their valuables at
You can catch me in the kitchen 'bout to break up somethin'
Large block, coffee pot 'bout to bake up somethin'
When I'm broke, you can catch me about to shake up somethin'
Wit that Colt four-pound that'll wake up somethin'
