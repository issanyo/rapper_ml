Young Weezy We and Eric B, aha
And I love all women (if you know what I mean)
Yes lord, I love them dark, I love them light
Short, tall, thick, thin and back one more again (alright)
But there's this one particular situation I need to tell you all about

I met a honey about a week ago
I got a little but I need some more
I ain't the only one to learn her curves
Matter of fact, forget what you heard
She's all, she's all that and more, oh yeah
Yes she is
Her reputation ain't squeaky clean
A little gossip ain't phasing me
So go ahead say what you want
You can give a damn, but I don't
Cause I'm gone, I'm already gone
Yes I am
Don't you know she's

She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
My redbone girl, redbone girl, yeah

Our baby hail from the Oakland Bay
Got an east coast vibe but a southern mind
A devil mind with an angel face
She'll leave and make a nonbeliever pray
For a chance, just to get some something
Yes she will
Uhh, you don't know what you do to me
But you're killing the girls in my history
I need a shot just to let her hit
She give me 2 when I need a fix
Lord knows I've tried, but I swear I can't quit
Don't you know she's my

She's my, redbone girl
Redbone but she's my world
Have you seen, my chocolate dream
My redbone girl, redbone girl
She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
My redbone girl, redbone girl, ooh

I like the long hair thick redbone
I do it so right, she say I'm dead wrong
And now she in love, like phase on
Now I'm in my zone, I got her head spinning, spinning like a cyclone
And it's them red women at my red eye zone
I'm high and my girl high yella
Fine as wine, put her in a wine cellar
Roses are red, do you mind if I smell them
What can you do, Consuela, Consuela
I like them light skin, lighter than a feather
And if she red hot, I'm biting that pepper
Tighter than my leather pants, let them say
She the same color as my flag â€“ suwoo

She's my, redbone girl
Redbone, she's my world
Have you see, my milk chocolate dream
My redbone girl, redbone girl, yeah
She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but you know she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
Redbone girl, my redbone girl, yeah
