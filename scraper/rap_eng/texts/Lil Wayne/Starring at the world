[Hook - Lil Wayne]
I’m just staring at the world from a Cadillac window baby
Hoping this girl in my passenger don’t act funny with me
Get her to my home, we get naked like some new born babies
I’m ready to perform and she’s gon’ be my audience
And she said: “Bravo”, and I said: “I know”, and she said: “Encore”
Girl I’m really big on you, so what you wan’ do?
Too fly, you need a parachute
Ohh, but that just means you’re falling inlove…
[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
In love with a skater
Five, six, seven, man I already ate her
She had a coffee mug and a pair of uggs
Got some makeup on my shirt when shegave me a hug, yeah
Shawty got me open, pussy so good wish I could smoke it
Uh, where your mans at? Remember melike this one time in band camp, yeahh
Like that man, she on my mind all day, check my CAT scan
Heyyy, where you going with all that?
I fuck her till she whine then I drink a tall glass
[Hook - Lil Wayne]
[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Girl you gon’ make me take ya to your desired destination
Left leg right leg, segregation, aha
Cause I know you like that shit, cause I love that shit
Girl that’s my hole, I dug that ditch
And when it gets cold, I’m there for her to hold
She climbs my pole, beat that pussy like it stole somethin’, haha
Cause she so fine, yeah, from the front, from the side, from behind
Pop that pussy like a cork and I’mma fuck you till you wine
