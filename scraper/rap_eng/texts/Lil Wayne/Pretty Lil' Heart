[Lil Wayne]
This is for the lovers and the sexy mother, mothers
Love is in the air, I pray to God I do not suffo
Cate, late night, lights dim, candles lit
She say Weezy fuck me harder, I say ooh, you the ooh
You commit, I commit, she say she love me, I’m convinced
Don’t need a rocket scientist to see that you and I are meant
I meant to tell you, you the reason I smile more, who I fell for
You know I beat that pussy up, Rocky Balboa
Girl I’m just playing unless you ain't and I can’t think
If there ain’t a thought about you, matter of fact that’s all I do
I put you first, now tell me that we’ll never be apart
Now I say, please girl don’t you go breaking my pretty little heart

[Robin Thicke]
Tell me something sweet, tell me something nice
Tell me something good, baby, tell me it’s alright
Tell me that you love me, tell me you’ll be there
I get so worried, sometimes the world will not be there
Tell me that I’m sexy like I was before
Tell me I got it that you want it even more
Tell me that you’ll never, ever, ever leave me side, side
Tell me cause you know I need to hear it every night

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart
I said baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart

[Robin Thicke]
Tell me who you with, tell me where you work
Tell me did you go out and start talking to some girl
I want to believe it, you know how hard I try
After all we’ve been through, it's so hard to say goodbye
Tell me that the future is getting brighter now
Tell me that we’ll make it, that we’ll make it somehow
Tell me it’s forever, that we’ll never part
Tell me that you’ll never break my pretty little heart

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart
And I said baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart

[Robin Thicke]
Tell me that’s the money, tell me I’m a star
Tell me that you’ll never break my pretty little heart
Say you’ll take me places, everything’s okay
Tell me cause you know I need that pump up everyday
Tell me that’s your money won't get in our way
Tell me that the chance I take, won’t blow up in my face
Tell me that you’ll do it that you’ll do it real
I’ll leave you if you break my pretty little heart, I will

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
And I said baby you got me don’t worry your pretty little heart
I said baby you got me don’t worry your pretty little heart
Baby you got me don’t worry your pretty little heart
And I said baby you got me don’t worry your pretty little heart

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
Yeah.. don't you worry baby
Don’t you worry, your pretty little heart…
Na-na-na, I love you baby!
Yeah, come on now; I got you, you got me
I love you, I love you, I love you baby
YEAH!
