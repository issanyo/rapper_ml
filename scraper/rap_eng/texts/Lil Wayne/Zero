[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
We don't even talk no more
We ran outta' words to say, Yeah
We don't even joke no more
We ran outta' games to play, Umm

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Now I know that you ain't used to
Hearin' me at a tempo as slow as this
But I just had to slow it down
So you can hear me when I say
I Need You, I Need You
I'm nothing without you a zero without you, Baby
I Need You, I Need You
I'm nothing without you, That's Why I'm glad I got you, Baby

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
We don't even laugh no more
What was funny yesterday isn't funny today, Lord
We don't make love no more
And when we do it's not the same man, Umm

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
And I know that you ain't used to
Hearin' me at a tempo as slow as this
But I just had to slow it down
So you can hear me when I say
I Need You
I'm nothing without you a zero without you, Baby
I Need You
I'm nothing without you, So glad I got you, Baby

[Outro: Lil' Wayne]
Yeah, I know it is...
I must be doing something right, I must be doing some...
I must be doing something right
And I'mma keep doing it right
I said I'mma keep doing it right, Uh, Oh
Yeah, Velvet
