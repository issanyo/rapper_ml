(Verse 1:)
Young Weezy F. Baby, hottest nigga on the block
Use to really buy sickles, now I really motivite
Pop a front wheel off
Chill up in the pillow with yo girl, he got her heels up
She tryna get my ceilings
Chill when she feel, some say I'm one of them realest niggas
Them realest nigga, the illest nigga
She heal this nigga, we chill this nigga
We drinkin not sippin, and we thinking bout dippin in the Jacuzzi skinny
She get me she must repeat the procedure
Till she get me, got me good, so good till I ohh
Once she got me she gotta get Mack Maine
Cause mami he just like me, my nigga from Hollyâ€”Grove
Go inside your clothes like legs inside of pants
And speaking of breads, my shit came straight outta France
I am would like to dance
I can, I really can
I am, I'm really not
I'm Wayne, I'm really hot
I'm Wayne, I'm really hot
I'm Wayne, I'm really hot
I'm Wayne, I'm really hot
Tha pain, tha? Yea

(Chorus:)
I'm in the game going hard, tryna get the rim
And if I got her, I'm a take one for the team
And if u fog it up, and dodge yourself off nigga
Go ahead be a playa, walk it off nigga
Walk it off nigga
Walk it off nigga
Go ahead be a playa, walk it off nigga
Walk it off nigga
Walk it off nigga
Go ahead be a playa, walk it off nigga

(Verse 2:)
Tip-toe on the sideline, get low when I see the referee
Like T.O, the eagles in my sock, I hide mine
I got my game unlock, I can find mine
Shit niggas up like a combine
Now I'm outside of the physicals like? do
I got steroids to heroine
He got me bonding with barry who... say I'm in psycho
Mami say me local, go crazy like winkle
Texas, like David caress
I'm waving a tech yea
Me, myself, I go to war with ATF yea
Be myself, ain't gotta be nobody else yea
Last one left, I cashmoney of the shelf yea
Damn, real got me so after gone
Coming for the bank, so who's the mothafuckin chancellor
Modafuckin holdin on a nigga's (? )
Standin at the front door like
DoDoDoDo, let me in!
DoDoDoDo, let me in!
DoDoDoDo, let me in!
DoDoDoDoDoDoDo, fucker

(Chorus:)
I'm in the game going hard, tryna get the rim
And if I got her, I'm a take one for the team
And if u fog it up, and dodge yourself off nigga
Go ahead be a playa, walk it off nigga
Walk it off nigga
Walk it off nigga
Go ahead be a playa, walk it off nigga

Go ahead be a playa, walk it off nigga

(Verse 3:)
Throw it off the backboard, tell em niggas line up

Mehn this bird is just competition (fuck em)
Opposely, to the opposition (fuck em)

Hey wat u know about the CEO poppin pistols
Mofucker that's the CEO proposition
Hey wat u know about the CEO poppin pistols
Tell me that boi...

(Chorus:)
I'm in the game going hard, tryna get the rim
And if I got her, I'm a take one for the team
And if u fog it up, and dodge yourself off nigga
Go ahead be a playa, walk it off nigga
Walk it off nigga
Walk it off nigga
Go ahead be a playa, walk it off nigga
Walk it off nigga
Walk it off nigga
Go ahead be a playa, walk it off nigga
