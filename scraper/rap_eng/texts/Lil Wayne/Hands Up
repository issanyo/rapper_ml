[Lil Wayne]
Let's get fucked up
On the road to riches
You're just a speed bump
Funny how the heater make a nigga freeze up
We smoke a tree down til it's just a tree stump
That Eastside nigga, bang on you bitches
I'm going at your neck, strangle you bitches
Got a long-ass list full of bad-ass bitches
And I stay burned out like a bad transmission
I'm on, like the lights I light up
The kush, knock out, Tyson fight
I'm talking about ass and titties, Sex and the City
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for "forget it"
I'm loving my shine, sipping on fine wine
Up in some fine dime, then she give me Einstein
Young Money motherfucker, yeah we picked a fine time
I'm a 17 nigga. Bitch, I don't mind dying, man
I just ended up on every bitch's sex list
Genie in the bottle, get a muthafuckin' deathwish
Thugga in this bitch, he say fuck y'all niggas
Breaking buds down the size of a football nigga
Red beam, gimme the light, no Sean Paul nigga
Let Nina bust in your face like a porn star nigga
Yeah I keep a Brian Pumper, no homo
The shit I'm on got the world moving in slow-mo
Man, I told Mack I was gonna do it
Above the law, but under the influence
Man, I was on the skateboard, kick push swagger
Got my girl to the room, got behind her like a shadow
I had her ass up in the air
I swear I got the largest clip in the world
Right here in my gat
And I wish a nigga play
I'mma bust a nigga ass
Hate Young Money? Then fuck you in the ass
187 and a hockey mask, YMCMB gonna ball
Til we fall. And this fuck all y'all
Gonna ball til we fall. And this fuck all y'all
We straight, sorry for the wait
