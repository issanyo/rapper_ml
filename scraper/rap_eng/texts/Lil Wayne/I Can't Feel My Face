[Verse 1]
Hardbody, motherfucker, got the heart of a killer
Young God in the building, 'bout to start a religion
Bout to call Bin Laden up and order some missiles
Bring 'em straight to your block and go to war with you bitches
If you hit the head then the rest fall in position
Shoot a nigga on his porch and make him fall in his kitchen
Copped a big-boy Porsche with all the specifics
And I keep that torch, baby, call me Olympics
Red, white, blue pill, flip my skills like gymnasts
And never give a bitch money, blood or kidneys
When the gun goes pow, I be at the finish
With my medal round my neck, autograph on my tennis
The land of the murder, dope, crack and syringes
Pull up on you in the coupeâ€”how fat is your engine?
Never talk to those that sat on the benches
Boy, I was in the game on fourth and inches
These niggas want the business, I'ma give these boys the business
See you fuckin' wit the boy that tote toys before Christmas
Got all these hoes trippin', got all these hoes strippin'
And we ain't P$C but them bitches know we Tippin
I just bought a pint and ain't none of y'all sippin'
Make my friends buy they own, fuck, I'm tired of bein' friendly
Ain't gotta lie just to try to be wit me
Bitches up in heaven waitin' after they die to be with me
I'm crazy for bein' Wayne, or is Wayne just crazy?
I been around, I'm still around, like them Geico cavemen
Hairpin trigger, no I won't shave it
I spot hip hop in the ocean, I'm gonna save it
The South is so dirty, bitch, you can't bathe it
Hollygrove dog and I feel like matin'
Babygirl, your pussy lookin' so vacant
And it's fuck you and fuck Georgia Bush, not Macon
Fuck Waist Deep, I'm in over my head
But it's cool, I'ma make it, I'm Good like Meagan
Your girl wants me to come Ronald like Reagan
Your boyfriend is softer than the carton the eggs in
I don't fear nothin' but God and weddings
At the top of my paper like I'm startin' a heading
My homie Santana, yeah that's my ace
But you may know us as I Can't Feel My Face

[Interlude]
Yeah, Weezy, bitch!
Don't give a fuck about you at all
I'm paid, been that way for a long time
Looks like I'ma die like that
'Cause if I ain't, I'ma just die

[Verse 2]
See they don't know where I came from
But they know where I'm goin'
And I'ma tell you just how the top feels when I'm on
In the game I'm no cheetah, I'm a tiger, I'm a cougar
I'm a panther, I'm a Bengal, Ocho Cinco
I'm illie, shirt softer than Gillie
In a pair of Gucci flops, feelin' freer than Willie
When them niggas Left Eye, it got a little bit Chili
But I just let it burn like the end of the Philly
Weezy
