[Chorus]
Money on my mind, money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Money on my mind, money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
So money is all I think of
Money on my mind, money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Money on my mind, money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
So money is all I think of

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Steppin' out the motherfuckin' car
They in awe
I'm looking like a star, bitch
When you see me make a wish
Holla at ya motherfuckin' boy, J.R
Birdman my pa, bitch
Ball bred, born rich
Dear Mr. Toilet, I'm the shit
Got these other haters pissed
Cause my toilet paper thick
I know, but trip
And that .40 make a chip
Out a potato-head wimp
Then, like ranch, I dip
And the hustle is all muscle
Just strength
When it comes to that weight I don't struggle
I just lift
I got my hand on the game
Yeah I make a grip
Hundred grand in my fist
Same on my wrist
Get key money from a quarter
Blame it on my wrist
I whip coke like hoes
Nigga I'm a pimp
Lil nigga 'bout to rape the market
If we talking 'bout money
Baby, now we talking

[Hook]
(Money on my mind)
Yeah, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Get money, get money, get money
(So money is all I think of)
Get money, get money, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
20 grand in the left
Another 20 in the right
Got my wallet in the back
And that thing packed tight
Credit cards don't need 'em
All the birds won't feed 'em
While I'm sitting at the table just me and family eatin'
E-class on the cell; discussing another mill'
Gucci Gucci bottle empty, daddy needs a refill
Up in frevay I'm standing on the bar
If it ain't a black truck it's a quarter million Maz'
I'm in love with kush and Kate Fox
If ya need anything hit the safe deposit box
Outta town for a month
Came home with a duffel it was one point something
Getting brain and I love it
Pimp, ask Khaled. Lobster salad
Mobster acknowledge I'm popping in Dallas
Pop collars I touch hoes like crep flow
The game in a choke hold
No I won't let go
