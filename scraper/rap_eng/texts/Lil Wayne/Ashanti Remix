[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Niggas know the boy whip game silly
Any time he in the city
In a continental Bentley
Ridin' around with a trunk full of sound
I'ma roll my windows down
And make sure all them bitches hear me
Homie better be chill behind that wheel
Motherfucker, oh I know you don't wan' hit me
'Cause I know you can't afford the damage
Hot Spitta fuckin' every girl on campus
A god with the flow and y'all below average
I do it how I do it, I don't need no practice
Yeah, and for you haters tryna get me
I don't run with the G-Unit but I run around with 50
Talkin' about them shots in a AK-47
Hit a nigga waistband, bring him all the way to heaven
Or hell, whatever you dwell
It all depend on how you was livin'
Before you fell a victim to the killin'

[Hook]
Yeah, no matter where I'm at, no matter where a nigga be
I know a bitch nigga don't be hatin' on me
'Cause i pulled up to the club in a Bentley GT
I feel them pussy niggas hatin' on me
I feel them pussy niggas hatin' on me
I guess it's 'cause their favorite hoes said that I'm a G
I guess that's why them niggas be hating on me
'Cause I got another nigga broad with me when I leave
I guess that's why them niggas be hating on me

[Verse 2]
In the rap game, playing it wrong
Talking crazy on the TV, then they scared to come home
'Cause they know that they gon' see me
I'ma tell him it's on
Knock a nigga head off and then I
