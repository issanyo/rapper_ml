[Intro]
What I was saying earlier was that
I'm tired of niggas just getting shit they don't deserve
That don't belong to them blood, I'm a thief
I'm a thief, I take your soul
I take your heart, I take your life
I take your Tina, I take your Tina Tina Tina Tina

[Hook]
Tina Turn Up need a tune up
Tina Turn Up need a tune up
Tina Turn Up need a tune up
Tina Turn Up need a tune up

[Bridge]
I could fix it
I could fix it
I could fix it
I could fix it
I could fix it
I could fix it

[Verse 1]
She need a king, fuck the prince
She need a king, fuck the prince
She need a king, fuck the prince
You a queen, not a princess
You a queen, let's have a princess
I could sell Sweet'N Low to Sugar Ray Leonard
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
I could sell Sweet'N Low to Sugar Ray Leonard

[Wayne talking]
You know, when things are different
It only means that they're not the same anymore, you know
Difference is good, very good

[Verse 2]
Oh so he ain't hear his phone ringin'?
Oh so he ain't hear his phone ringin'?
Oh so he ain't hear his phone ringin'?
But he hear your's when it's on vibrate?
You with that nigga he don't wanna see you with?
Tell his ass you on a blind date
Tell his ass you on a blind date
Yeah I'm hating, oh y'all just dating?
Well I'm still hating, tell him I said it

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]

She need a king, she need a king
Weezy the king, Weezy the king
Weezy the king, need a king
Tina turn up need a, need a, need a
Tina turn up need a, need a, need a
Girl you need a real nigga
Girl you need a real nigga
Girl you need a real nigga
You going ever meet your last, keep it real with you
You going ever meet your last, keep it real with you
You going ever meet your last, keep it real with you
If you was mine, I will keep you with me
If you was mine, you would be right here with me
If you was mine, you would be right here with me
Fuck that nigga, fuck that nigga
Yeah I'm hating

[Outro]
I asked my homies right, I was like
What do you think I should do?
And man there's only one thing to do
And I was like what's that?
They was like you...ya digg?
And not you in the meaning of me
But you in the meaning of you
Tina Turn Up, you need a tune up, ya digg?
Well I could fix her, young blacksmith
Maintenance man, M & M for short
Melt in your mouth not in your hand
