Yo, this right there
For all my girlfriends
Mine too

Tell me what is it that I gotta do, baby
For you to be my girlfriend?
And girl, I know you're tired of being that chick on the side
You wanna be the only girlfriend

You wanna be the one to say, ohh, ohh
The only one they bring it home too
So go on and tell me what is it you gonna do about me?
'Cause I can promise you, I know what I'ma do about you
(Do it)

You want a hot one to buy for ya ringtone
This'll be for my girlfriends
Fellas, she want something hot for her ringtone
Get this for ya girlfriends

And yo, for those that be treating their girl wrong
I might make her my girlfriend
If you don't pay attention to what she say about you
You better pay attention to what she saying 'bout me

It's 98 degrees, blazing hot, I'm at the summertime spot
And y'all ain't gonna believe these girls
(Walking 'round in them)
Bathing tops with them bottoms
That the G's like to come to the dirty south for

But there's one in particular dame, I remember
From the bank she work, in the drive through
(She's saying)
Boy, I bet you don't even remember me, I'm thinking
Who in the hell could forget about you

She said, she came here with her girlfriends
And I'm looking at her thinking for so long I wanted to get at you
But I know you with your girlfriends
Ya, we can talk but not really in the way that I know I need to

Girl, I done heard you been through some things
(Some things)
No explainin', I already know, I wanna start by makin' it clear
That ain't got a thing to do with us

Tell me what it is that I gotta do, baby
For you to be my girlfriend?
And girl, I know you're tired of being that chick on the side
You wanna be the only girlfriend

I ain't made love in a long time, am I makin' out tonight?
Shawty, if you got the answer, now put your hands up
Keep playin', girl, I'ma make you put your man up
Pull up in a phantom, inside sicker than cancer
She hopped from her seat, that's a private dancer

I said, boom, boom
Slow down, baby
Easy, baby
It's weezy, baby

I need her lady like Eva maybe
But if you get desperate, I'ma leave you, baby
I wouldn't lie to you, if you did, I'd tell you
I study when you pace 'cause I ain't trynna fail you
I'm just trynna feel you

Girl, lemme tell you
I can have you hoopin' and hollerin' like Mehalyu
I'ma keep you sittin' up, breathe 'em, remove your belt, yeah
Or better yet just tear ya up, I tell ya

Tell me what it is that I gotta do, baby
For you to be my girlfriend?
And girl, I know you're tired of being that chick on the side
You wanna be the only girlfriend

You wanna be the only to say, ohh, ohh
The only one they bring it home to
So go on and tell me what it is you gonna do about me?
'Cause I can promise you I know what I'ma do about you

This'll be for girls from the A, to the girls form New Orleans
To girls who ain't never felt love
This'll be the name in the song that I had to put on
Just to say I appreciate y'all

You know them girls out west, I can't forget
You know I love New York, I can't forget
And this'll be for every single girl in every single town
Didn't mention y'all but I ain't forget
(You gotta know if you my)
Girlfriend

'Cause I'm the type of nigga you can come home and talk you
(I'm just saying if my)
Girlfriend, girl, was you, you would never have to deal
With what you dealing with now

Girl, I'ma give it to you straight with no chase
(No chase)
From the moment that I first saw you
I had to let you know the way
That your boy was feeling about you

Tell me what it is that I gotta do, baby
For you to be my girlfriend?
And girl, I know you're tired of being that chick on the side
You wanna be the only girlfriend
