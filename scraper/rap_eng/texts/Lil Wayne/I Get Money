Hey heh, hey heh

[Birdman]
We the business
Coming through shining
Blew a couple of hundreds
Big Tyming all the time, nigga been stuntin
Pearl white Maybach, nigga spent a mill
Bugatti for 2, on the hill
Shining with my strap in my right pocket
Hundred thousand a day on that sky rocket
From round the block doing this shit round the clock
Million dollar nigga doing this shit non-stop
Swagged out, big dogging on a private flight
Popping bottles, celebrating living life
Blowing big, freelander down the sand
YMCMB nigga, rich gang

[Mack Maine]
Ugh, big dawg shit nigga
I’m on my feet like dog shit nigga
Tell em hatin’ niggas miss me with that hatin’ shit
And tell them bitches, my dick got a waiting list
I ain’t trippin nigga I’m just taking trips
Put the money on the trampoline and make it flip
Young Mack, stupid Macknupid
I just bought a coupe, the roof is translucent
Pockets on etcetera, Money talk bullsh-t, walk like George Jefferson
Virgins they ain't fucking with us
Young Money Cash Money
Fuck them other niggas

[Lil Wayne]
If I ain't getting money, then I’m getting pussy
I don’t play with you p-ssies get a silver bullet
I know you looking so how I look
I don’t fuck with niggas, call me George Bush
It’s Tunechi baby, the money man
The money talks, now I understand
That chopper make a nigga do the running man
I would take a girl and turn her pussy to a punching bag
I’mma stunt my ass off, bitch thats word to Stunna man
School these bitch ass niggas, you are undergrad
The World is in my hand, smack the shit out you with my other hand
Young Money, Cash Money, welcome to Wonderland
