[Verse 1: Dae Dae]
Let that money talk, let that money talk
You dead broke, that's your daddy fault
I'm high horse, you asphalt
Your Rollie fake, that shit unthawed
Both a bulldog, knock your block off
I smoke rapper weed, this that moon rock
I'm certified, you minimised
I'm maximised, look in my eyes
Don't fuckin' lie, don't be surprised
They legally blind, don't wanna see me shine
Signed my first deal, about time
All that penny pinchin' that you do, you better

[Hook: Dae Dae]
Spend that shit, spend that shit

Spend that check and get it right back
Spend that check and get it right back

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Spend a check on whoadies, marry the game, always
Riding down Peach Street in a flying saucer
They ask it who is me? Bitch, who is you?
Say you getting money, nigga whoop di doo
Shit, do what it do, be what it do
Water what it do, skeedo, what it do
All my niggas with me, they got 10 on 'em
The Perc got a 10 on it, car got a twin, don't it?
Yeah, all my properties, they got Benz on 'em
I ask her to come over, then I ask can her friends come
This that condo in buckhead shit, no photos so fuck that shit
Chain on, buffing shit, it'll make you tuck your shit
Spend it and get it back, I used to pray for a 50 pack
Niggas ain't standing off in the trap, they say you work on the internet
They dealing forreal, forreal, this stuff is a death deal
See you had to act to steal and I bought some Acts to spill

[Hook: Dae Dae]
Spend that shit, spend that shit

Spend that check and get it right back

Spend that shit, spend that shit

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Spend a check and get it right back
Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe that
She walking round in her night clothes
I'm 'bout to fuck her with my eyes closed
Damn, on her pussy, got that pussy and fuck that
Sent her on a shopping spree, said I give her space
Million dollars in the safe, put some mileage on her Wraith
I don't sip that red nigga, I don't smoke that shade
I just be spending profusely, I just be sipping profusely
I just be fucking masseuses, I just be fucking exclusive
Broke niggas come with excuses, rich niggas come and they cruising
I spent that there therapeutic, broke bitch not included
All these bitches taking pictures
When you die, you cannot take it with you
I got Cash Money out the picture
Now the checks are getting big, big spender, big spender yeah

[Hook: Dae Dae]
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend that shit, spend that shit
Spend that check and get it right back
Spend that check and get it right back
Spend that shit, spend that shit

Spend that check and get it right back
Spend that check and get it right back
