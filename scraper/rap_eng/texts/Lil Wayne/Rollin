[Intro]
G5 sitting on the runway
Big-ass chopper
Call that bitch Beyonce
This for my dogs locked down all day
Money, power, respect
Three the hard way
I put some real niggas on their feet, boy
So they'll kill anyone for me, boy
Yeah, YMCMB, boy
Young Tunechi, fresh to death
Rest In Peace, boy

[Verse 1]
My gat bang
Your hat hang
I ride off with Mack Maine
I drink Patron straight
You niggas keep that champagne
My Pa is the Birdman
I'm rich as a white man
I come to your show and
Kill you and your hypeman
We rollin', let's roll out
My bitches don't hold out
They got Marley G
I gotta bond my lil bro out
Let my dreads grow out
My bitch got a blow out
Mi casa su casa
My house is a ho house
Only fuck with real niggas
Polo, fuck that Hilfiger
Yeah I'm on a pill nigga
Feed you to my lil niggas
Shout out to my big homies
Fee-Fee and T-Streets
Scope on that AK
Make me take a sneak peek
T, roll another one
Razor blade under tongue
You ain't never seen this watch
Nigga, this a one of one
You niggas is honey bun
Your girlfriend a ton of fun
Chopper with a drum
Motherfucker, give the drummer some
Blunt fat like my blunt a thumb
Suck a nigga's dick or somethin'
Pop that pussy for me
Then wild out and give my niggas some
I'mma do my thing
I put that on Nicki Minaj
I need a bad redbone
To come give my dick a massage
I'm talking big money
I'm talking heavyweight
I cut down on the syrup
Now I'm in better shape
I'm from New Orleans, nigga
Where you ain't never safe
You fuck with me
I drop you off in front of Heaven gates

[Verse 2]
OK
Jump off a building
Jump out a window
Smoke like a junkie
And fuck like a nympho
Drink like a goldfish
That's right, you know this
Hold up; Click-clack
OK, I'm reloaded
Fuck with Lil Tunechi
I'm good, I'm Gucci
Wild as Ryu
I hit you with that Hadouken
My money too long, nigga
My weed too strong, nigga
Fuck everybody
I'm in my own zone, nigga

[Outro]
And every time you see me I'm wet
And I'm rolling
Tunechi, Rest In Peace
Fresh to death
And I'm rolling
'Bout to fuck a bitch I just met
'Cause she rolling
Nigga we rolling
Nigga I'm rolling
Gotta keep a towel, I'mma sweat
'Cause I'm rolling
Goin' at a bitch nigga's neck
'Cause I'm rolling
Damn ma, I ain't come yet
'Cause I'm rolling
Bitch, I'm rolling
Young Mula, baby
Sorry for the wait
