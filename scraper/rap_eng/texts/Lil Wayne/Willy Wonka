Feat. Lil Wayne
I I I don't like the look of it
I I I don't like the look of it
I I I don't like the look of it

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Ok I'm sipping on the syrup got a nigga mioving slow
I'm all bout the money what the fuck you think I do it for
Just don't act like you ain't know I'm killing these rap ass niggas
Costing them thier caskets for your motherfucking funeral
Keep these women with me shit I gotta keep two or more
Party everyday like we won the fucking superbowl
Chilling with my nigga mack he keeps bitches handy
White girls on the table let them sniff the nose candy
When I'm walking by the women say who is that
Nigga I reply I'm gudda gudda that nigga
I was raised in a home of cap splitters
Whip on 24s watch it crawl like a caterpillar
I come with a toy boy like a happy meal
And you a motherfucking duck daffy dale
From the school of hard knocks where we scrap and kill
Pick the kinfe with gunna you could get the package deal
I'm hot nigga burning everything around me
I was lost for a minute took a while but I found me
The streets say I'm king but the game will never crown me
Realest nigga doing it just ask the nigga round me
So you can't size me up but try to clown a
Shark jump in the water and I'm a drown ya
New orleans gun out I'm a down ya
Put niggas to sleep like a downer
I'm a great white you a flounder
Fish ain't a bitch i'll tuna everything around ya
You hoe gudda move everything around ya
It's young money bitch at the top is where they found us
Nigga

(wayne sparks up)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Goons I'm back marley don't shoot 'em
Silence on a gun watch a nigga mute 'em
The coach and the boot call me jon gruden
Schooled these nigga they all my students
All jokes aside I ain't playing with ya
The weed broke down like a transmission
Choppers spin like a ballerina
I'm still spitting like I ate a jalapeno
I'm from uptown my bitchs from argentina
My pockets on fat like joey cartagena
Stunt so hard it's all ya'll fault
And when it come to beef give me a-1 sauce
I ain't worrying about shit everything paid
Catch me poolside in dwayne wades house
Wth a high yellow bitch with her legs out
Catch money president but we in red house
Who the fuck want it name a fucking day
Blow the candles out my nigga cut the cake
I gotta eat bitch like a runaway
Ya'll niggas ain't eating stomache
Ok all these bitches and niggas still hatin
I used to be ballin but now I'm bill gating
Fuck you with my iphone bumpin illmatic
I'm on the road to riches it's just a lil traffic
Hair still platic fuckins a habit
Keep my guitar hip hop manny cravis
Bought your bad bitches and I fuck 'em like rabbits
Dope big weezy your girlfriends a addict
Uh

I I don't I I don't
I don't like the look of it
