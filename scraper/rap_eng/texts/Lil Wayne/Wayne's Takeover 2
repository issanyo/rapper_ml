Get me that piffy, I'm higher than my attire

Women wanna suck all on my pacifier
And if she tell ya she didn't, homie thats a liar
You see me passin by ya, More like flashin
Lights, Camera but I'm more like Action

Cool cat, wind breezin through my whiskers
Hurry, speed up, hater you just missed us
