[Chorus: HoodyBaby]
It just seems like I've been screwing up
Everything I touch gets to ruining
My homies call it growing pains
I'm trying not to go insane
Rain falls down
Staring out my window
You know when it rains it pours
I can't even lie no more
Tears fallin' down on my window
Rain falls down

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Yeah
Rain rain rain feel like heat on my skin yeah
I was born to lose but baby girl I'm a win yeah
[?] in my lifestyle in my skin yeah
And I'm a hellboy fuck a 9-5 I'm all in yeah
Now I'm stuck lookin' at hell rain through my window
While those butterflies outside my damn window
Got my third eye open see the world through my window
Got a big Draco on me pussy boy I let it go
Bitch you getting smoke, blowin' on hella dope
With some good smoke, murder what she fuckin' wrote
Yeah I took her soul, pussy boy she better off
Then she gave me the throat, hope lil baby don't choke
(I love Trippie Redd)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Second door to the right
Escobar, Dolomite
Repertoire of frozen ice
Pepper, salt, fork and knife
Spoonin' with a nigga wife
Boolin in a bitches life
Doin' shit that give me life
Throwing dick like a strike
Pink pants, white shirt
Pink xans, white percs
Pink sands, white dirt
Mink pants, nice fur
Thought fast not first
Hard times light work
Every heart might jerk
Cold hearted, iceburg
Paul Wall slow mo, sip a four need four more
Smoke the whole weed in 24, I'mma pour pour pour soul
More more rain flow, black Rolls just cruise
No umbrella, no coupe, [?]

[Chorus: HoodyBaby]
It just seems like I've been screwing up
Everything I touch gets to ruining
My homies call it growing pains
I'm trying not to go insane
Rain falls down
Staring out my window
You know when it rains it pours
I can't even lie no more
Tears fallin' down on my window
Rain falls down
