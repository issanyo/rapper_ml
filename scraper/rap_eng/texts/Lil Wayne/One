[Hook]
One for the hurt
One for the heal
But one for the hammer, getta nigga killed
Fill a nigga up, the ending is forreal
We gonna hit the nigga up
And split a nigga mill

[Verse 1]
Yea, Im goin' in; Drake
Runnin' like a sprinter when his ankle full of attaint
Got my mind on my money
Eyes on my neighbors
Never know whats your spot till they say back, till the base, back to the wall
Cuzz I never stall like the bathroom in a mall
You can tell them all
Ridin' through my avenue, they better kill us all
Cuz even my daddy shoots
Say you gon' get me? Boy I got a gun too
See you on my side, watch you rise like the sun do
Hey yo honcho, built for rain like a poncho
Under pressure all you say is uncle
Yea, never hard as they look
I never judge a cover 'fore I open up the book
Wayne we can split the plate, but I'mma take dessert
This will only take the second, but I always come first yellin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I drove first, this that quick animation
You smell that stench, you just stink sanitation
I'm right here, nigga fuck the location
Cuz too much information can get you that vacation
Yea, if niggers actin' how they feel
Then I pull it out the jacket, get to clappin' like a seal
Yea, kidnappin' the little ones
Throwin' bitch niggers off the back of the buildin'
Die now I'mma think about it later
I'mma think about it never, all I think about is paper
I hope you know to fly and sincerely
I would do the same thing to everyone you live with
Tell the cops I say "Fuck the allegation"
Got work in the trunk with no conversation
Everything stand for sendin' to the heavens sky
Weezy F Baby, boy get it right everytime

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Y'all know my stylo, gotta big ego
I'm really superman, I'm Japan a loco hero
Count this to Netto, split it with the ghetto
M.O.B. to the cash I say hello
Finally got a load of me and everybody notice me
My girl gon' need a ladder if she think she gon' get over me
Call me mister Pay-so, movin' at Pay-tio
You could'nt even catch if you was Y-Generatio
Man I think it's racio, they dont like the name Blaack
Couple more strikes but I swear I'm the same cat
Never be a zero all my life, my chain like smart kids, all of them bright
One for the grind, think like a hustler
If you dont feel me, you must be a customer
Get alot of airtime, call me airline
Plus I'm ahead like the place you make your hairline

[Hook]
