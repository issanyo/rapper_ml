[Intro]
I got Nosk in here with me
This ain't a diss song
But uh

[Hook]
Yeah huh-huh, you know what it is
I'm a Cheesehead, y'all niggas Cheez-Whiz
Pittsburgh Steelers, that's nothing
That Superbowl ring, that's stunting
Up in your town when you see me you know everything
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow
I put it down, representing for my team
I'm in
Green and yellow green and yellow
Green and yellow green and yellow

[Verse 1]
Money green, yellow broad
Aaron Rodgers: MVP award
This is Green Bay, bitch we go hard
This is Packer country, where's your Green card?
Terrible towels, that shit is bo-ring
We got the ball, you know we scoring
Yeah, and that's how we rocking, heavy metal
I'm up in this bitch with more Bloods than a blood vessel
Pitt going down, say hello to the devil
Just beat the Bears, now we got the Steelers on the schedule
Yeah, no love for them, breaking hearts
We gonna toast these niggas...Pop-tarts

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Got a call from my homie, this just in
The Packers in the Superbowl, and they better win
They call him Big Ben, but he weak though
We in Dallas but we Lambeau Leap, ho
Long hair don't care: Clay Matthews
We shitting on these fools, no bathroom
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up, touchdown on Ike Taylor

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Huh...big Gs on the helmet
Steel Curtain, what is that, velvet?
If we win, I'm-a throw a Superbowl party
And blow a cigar like Vince Lombardi
I'm in Wisconsin, smoking Amsterdam
Yeah, I'm from New Orleans but I've been a Packers fan
We knocked the Eagles and the Falcons and the Bears off
Now we about to cut Troy Polamalu hair off

[Hook]

[Outro]
Uh, go pack go
Uh, go pack go
Uh, we yelling go pack go

I gotta say this ain't a diss song
I do love my team
Yeah, that's the team with the big 'G's on the helmet
You know what it is
Oh yeah... Young Mula Baby
