When i'm down in the studio
Tryin' to make a track
My girl be at home and lovin' my back
And everytime I say that's what i'm doin'
She don't think that's what i'm doin'
When it's her that i'd rather be doin'

But right now i'm in the studio
Making this track
My girl at home n lovin my back
She blowin' on my phone
She tells me she's alone
I say I won't be long
Let me finnish this song

But right now i'm in the studio
Eatin' this track
My girl at home beggin' me to come back
Okay i'm comming home
And when i get home
Girl I'ma kill it like i'm killin this song

But right now i'm in the studio
Man just record me
And even with an equlizer you couldn't pause me

Haha, yeah, this is the office
Come be my secretary baby this is the office
In my office I was a nine to five
But you can be my six to ten
I'ma say it again
My office i was a nine to five
But you can be my six to ten

But right now i'm in the studio
And everytime I try to say that's what i'm doin'
She just think it's an exuse
And i'm all tryin' to get some new pussy
I tell her i'm a hustler baby
And new money feels better than new pussy
But right now i'm in the studio
And everytime i try to say that's what i'm doin'
She just think it's an exuse
And i'm all tryin' to get some new
Okay, honey i'm home
And yeah i'm top
And if i fall asleep then shawty
I'ma fall asleep in your bed
