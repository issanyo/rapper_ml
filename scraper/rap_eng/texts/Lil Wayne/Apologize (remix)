[Refrain: One Republic]
I'm holdin' on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you're saying
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I'm talking 'bout a good girl gone bad
Crooked world, wrong path; right Mom, wrong Dad
I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up, like some barbecue from Luther's
In the morning with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the fresh-cut and they're on her, like sutures
And I wanna talk to her, but her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better, she's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby, you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain, trust me, I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an on-comin' train
Stuck in the passenger seat, travelin' through the fast lane

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well, once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside, had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two-story house, two-car garage
And a white picket-fence wrapped around the front yard
See, Daddy was a doctor and Mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced, so now Mommy's a dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit, now he's a snorter
And all this shit is takin' place right in front of the daughter
She says, "Daddy, what's wrong?", but he's just too high
"Mommy, what we gon' do?", she just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night
Shit ain't right

[Refrain: One Republic]
I'm holding on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you're saying
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey

[Hook: One Republic]
You say that it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
