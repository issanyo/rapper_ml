Umm Hello world I'm your motherfucking troublemaker
Hello world I'm your motherfucking troublemaker
I ain't a peacemaker, I'm the peacetaker
I'm very destructive, watch me break you
Yeah, I love to smell that blood, bitch
Call me the devil what the hell that was
Yeah and you can call me young money streets
And you can see me for all the young money beef
I'm the troublemaker

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Call me mr. kill 'em all
Bitch nigga don't get involved
Shoot you on the front porch
And knock you to the back yard
Knock your fucking back off
Knock your top rack off
You just see jill on the hill, I knocked jack off
But this ain't nursery
This is brain surgery
Ski mask on my bullets
Let em commit brain burglery
Emergency, it's an emergency
Someone in all black left the whole scene burgundy
Kamikaze you can try me I'mma shoot you
When the gun in this position you can call it Kama sutra
I'mma cock and do it like a motherfucking rooster
You pussy boy I'm your mutherfucking doucha
Haha, better run like bobby boucha
It's Weezy baby it's time to induce you
You think you're really safe in here
Stand up we about to take it there
And when we do we come for you to take your body
Where nobody else with eyes can see
And I told them don't start no shit won't be no shit
Don't start no shit won't be no shit
Don't start no shit won't be no shit
Don't start no shit won't be no shit
