(Bitch)
Right now, man
The streets of New Orleans is real fucked up, man
But, don't look at it like that cause
I ain't gonna lie, it's so back --
It's not back to normal, cause it'll never be
But, I mean, it's back to a way
That you probably didn't think it would be back to
So, you know what I mean
People are living
People are breathing
But you know what I mean
That shit still was fucked up
And it's gonna always be fucked up
And people are still fucked up about it
And people are still fucked up over it
People died, and that's what's real about it
You know what I mean
The streets is gonna always be fucked up
