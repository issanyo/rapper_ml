[Lil'Wayne talking]
Yea..biatch..who the fuck..how the fuck
You really wanna know the sqad

[Verse 1]
Me, I snort the dro'
And Baby supply the extra arms
And charges don't stick the dudes
We cutt'em of
We see Weezy everyday
Were the fuck did he go to
Cause if we don't know u
The nina blow u
And..Supa'll show u how to bag up shit
And Young Yo'll show u quick, how to back ya bitch
And T.Redd'll teach u right how to mash on the gas
And if u sight, he'll mash on ya ass
And J too
But Snipes, he lose on ya fast, like young cash
Like,he blew the mash on gas
Sqad 7, we ball heavy
We all in till we all dead
We stay fed of cheese and bread
And we never fuck wit hoes that never gave head
We like shaved pussy
We don't save pussy
We students of the game
And we never play rookie
U hata's
????

[Chorus]
S-Q-A-D U-P
Lil' Weezy
S-Q-A-D, you see
Weezy
S-Q-A-D U-P
Lil' Weezy

[Verse 2]
I get money like i get pussy
I get pussy like i get headaches
And migranes run in my family
And u might not be a crackhead
But theres one in ya family
I just broke a bricker off
Some theres some in ya family
Me and Benjamin so tight
We becomin' a family
And the Benz i'm in so tight
Ya wife comin' to jam me
And the rims i ride right
Drop the shit on choppaz
Or the old skool chrome riderz
We seein' Weezy Wee
Come thru on broaders
I'm send a single to bottle
Just like u know i'm a rider
Now followin' me to the of my squalla
I swalla to the end of my bottle
My nigga sam
The only friend is my dolla
Bumpin' head in a raspberry Bentley
Cuttin' up
U would think itz a weddin' how the rims is buttoned up
And itz Weezy ya bitch, i be thuggin' in public
S-Q-A-D double or nuthin'

[Chorus]
S-Q-A-D U-P
Lil' Weezy
S-Q-A-D, you see
Weezy
S-Q-A-D U-P
Lil' Weezy

[Verse 3]
I bang a coward if he lookin' like he fuckin' wit Weezy
Leave a nigga like..
He fucked wit Weezy
Young Wayne m
Ride around in a plain M
First lane, cross lane, flame him
Itz where the game end
I twist a nigga up so bad
See his body at the funeral
They say it ain't him
Bitch niggas surround me
It can get uglier than India Arie
When i'm spittin' the tommy
And no matter what this rap do
I'm gettin' the money
I can quit and get off a whole brick in mornin'
I can spit and get off a whole cook and devour
And shift and make lift off the whole of top of the 'Rari
I can spit like a mack 90
Either way i can send big azz blades to ya zig zag braids
Niggas get right or get laid
Young, fuck it
I swear man u won't love it

Biiaaattccchhh
