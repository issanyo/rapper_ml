[Intro: Lil' Wayne & Lil Juice]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
I tell you I love you
I tell you I need you
I say I won't leave you
(Uh)

[Verse 1]
I like when I'm faded, I'm so innovative
Eatin' pussy at my dinner table, I been gettin' it catered
Get the yayo, got me spendin' pesos, Benjamin tornado
Count my blessin's, this is what we pray for, everyone ain't able
Drop her heart, just like a hot potato, I'ma say though
She think she lit, I am fuego, keep that BS in her a-hole
'Cause I say so, and my bando, we just lay low
Rub my back, ask how my day go
I say I been on my Jay-O
She say, "They know", say no mo'
'Cause she go low, bless my wo-wo
I say "Uh-oh," she start slow-mo
Once that coco start her mojo
She gon' go-go, she gon' deep throat 'til it's sore throat
She go deep sleep, I go NoDoz
Said "I love you," watch my nose grow
Once that dope go, she go bozo
Girl, I'm gone

[Chorus]
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby (Yuh)
I tell you I love you, baby
I tell you I need you, baby
I say I won't leave you, baby (I say I won't leave you)
Then I get amnesia, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
I tell you I love you (I tell you I love you)
I tell you I need you (I tell you I need you)
I say I won't leave you (I say I won't leave you)
Then I get amnesia (Then I get amnesia)
I'm smokin' Keisha, baby (Keisha)
I'm high as Felicia, baby (Felicia)
I'mma find me a vegan baby (Gone)
'Cause I'm tired of this beefin' baby (Yuh)
I tell you I love you, baby (Tell you I love you)
I tell you I need you, baby (I need you)
I say I won't leave you, baby (I won't leave you)
I like when I'm faded (Gone)

[Verse 2]
So outta here, keep that shit over there
Where do we go from here
Come to the end of the road
Can't get the road repaired
I am on Mars with a bitch in her underwear
She take 'em off and then come back to Earth
In a hundred years, you niggas Gummy Bears
Rest in peace Rabbit
I got the Lamborghini doors up like some bunny ears (Ahh)
Bitch, best not jump in here
Bitch, best not run in here talkin' crazy
Get her walkin' papers
See these married niggas makin' it hard for players
But, see, the hardest players is too hard to play
I give her dick and a couple ultimatums
A cup of bumbu and a cup of coffee later
She do all the drugs, he do all the favors
So we fuck now and we argue later
Dick runnin' like an alternator
I don't separate 'em, I just alternate 'em
I got all the flavors, sit back enjoy the fruit of our labors
You gon' tan that applebottom, it's gon' be orange later
So I fucked the girl, wrote my number down
On the morning paper, set it on the table
Told her, "I'll be back" - Schwarzenegger
Li'l mama, I'm gone (Gone)

[Chorus]
Hasta la vista, baby (Yah)
Hasta la vista, baby (Yah)
Hasta la vista, baby (Hasta la vista)
Hasta la vista, baby (Yah)
I tell you I love you, baby (I tell you I love you)
I tell you I need you, baby (I tell you I need you)
I say I won't leave you, baby (I say I won't leave you)
I'm not gonna need you, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
I tell you I love you (I tell you I love you)
I tell you I need you (I tell you I need you - Hey!)
I say I won't leave you (I say I won't leave you)
I'm not gonna need you (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
I tell you I love you (I tell you I love you)
I tell you I need you (I tell you I need you)
I say I won't leave you (I say I won't leave you)
I'm not gonna need you (I'm not gonna need you)
