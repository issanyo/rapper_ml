[Intro]
Drought 3
Yessir
Look

[Verse 1]
I bought it out like Stunna
I hope when we kiss we make you sick to your stomach
Stuntin' like my daddy, and your momma eat rubbers
I bet that I can do the mouth to mouth with your woman
My house is a dungeon
Yellow diamond ring looking like a little Funyun
Stand on my toes, you can call me Paul Bunyan
Switchin' up my flows like a nigga do construction
The microphone wet 'cause my words' like seduction
And when we on the jet you don't come up in the discussion
And if you say you ballin', we probably don't trust ya
And I know plenty freaky hoes that probably won't fuck ya
Even if you paying, boy, they probably won't fuck ya
Only if I say that she can touch ya, like Busta
But she might crutch ya, and burn ya, like Usher
Me and my clique be in red, like Russia
I shit these rappers out, and sometimes I forget to flush ya
Grandaddy Purp or Bubble Kush crush ya
Explode in a bitch mouth like a Gusher
Cash Money, Young Money, check the production
I am just a Martian, get prepared for abduction

[Verse 2]
Umm, I walk it out like crutches
Two girls jump me like double dutches
My nigga T-Streets know a girl named Duchess
And every time he see her in the street, she be cussin'
I told him he should wave the black flag 'cause she buggin'
He said "The pussy good," he said "Ya dig?" So I dug him
I'm looking for a real bad bitch with a husband
I'll give her much dick and a whole lot of nothin'
I'm spittin' like I stumbled on a gold pot or somethin'
And when I was six I saw my role model hustlin', so I got a hustle
These rappers talking 'bout a whole lot of nothin'
You dropped me on Saturday, I sold out on Sunday
Fuck is the arguing 'bout? Nigga, Tha Carter out
This is what I call a Drought â€” 3
And we don't walk it out, we drop-top Porsche it out
They better walk 'em out, before we chalk 'em out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk 'em now
They don't want it, uh-uh; no, they don't want it, uh-uh
You see, they phony, I'm not; oh yeah, they phony, I'm not
I Eastside walk it out, I bring New Orleans out
I am a Saints fan, oh yeah we marchin' now
Like we're a Saints band, I play the organs now
And if they talking, most likely I'm what they talking 'bout
My nigga T from the East roll up that forest now
Man, I'm just trying to get my Peanuts, I'm like Charlie Brown
OK, that Uzi make a Harley sound
Take two of these and walk around
Come straight from that homeless town
This game belong to Carter now, bitch
