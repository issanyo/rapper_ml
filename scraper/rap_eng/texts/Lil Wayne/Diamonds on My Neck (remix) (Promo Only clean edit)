[Chorus x3: Biggie Smalls]
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
I'm talkin pails of green, talkin pails of green
Talkin pails of green, talkin pails of green

[VERSE 1: Smitty]
Where them trees at? Where them ki's at?
Where my G's at? Where my-where my G's at?
All grey Impala, big dollas like cred tho
Where them E's at, where them P's at?
Said you need that, where my where my G's at?
Nu-nuttin less tho, watch full of crystals
Hands on that bottle, wit that bottle full of X-O
Got 2 or 3 dimes in the back-back
Got 2 or 3 rounds in that tech-tech
Bought 23's round on that S-S
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my necklace!

[Chorus x2: Biggie Smalls]
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
I'm talkin pails of green, talkin pails of green
Talkin pails of green, talkin pails of green

[VERSE 2: Smitty]
Where them low ridas, where them poofs at?
Where my roof at, where my-where my roof at?
And yea I thought so, switched like I'm hot tho
Say you gettin money like me, but you not tho
Where them 4-5's, where them trey's at?
Where them K's, where my-where my K's at?
Just got those, just from the box tho
Red mark means enemies pay a lotto
And you can hear it in the back-back
The beat pounds like the sound of a mack-mack
Ay we ain't playin around nigga that's that
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my necklace

[Chorus x2: Biggie Smalls]
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
I'm talkin pails of green, talkin pails of green
Talkin pails of green, talkin pails of green

[VERSE 3:]
I'ma tell you what that nigga told me
Mouth of golds don't make you no G
Got beef wit em, now we gon see
If the gang wanna bang, I'ma play KG
What it's gon be?(be) Got an OZ (Z)
Drop down, top down, blowin AC
Live in the back, black tee crisp
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my necklace

[Chorus: fades out]
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
I'm talkin pails of green, talkin pails of green
Talkin pails of green, talkin pails of green
