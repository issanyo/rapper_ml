[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I met her in Victoria's, she was hotter than the crown Victoria
On my block, on a Friday, 6:00
Before I was on that Young Jock, she was on that Sileen and rock
I tryed to tell her my name, but laughed more so
Because she looked like 10 summers, I don't know
So I told her my number, and I got her's also
And of course she knew I had a girl, I wouldn't be in the stove
So we hooked up that morning, like around 4
And at that time, I knew she was down for
Soon as the door opened, war opened
She was such a soldier, purple heart pokin
Her fatigues, but she's never fatigue
And with her, whatever I say, she believes
And my girl know, I got my magic short sleve
But with her, I can disappear when I need

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, she don't even care about my girlfriend
She say she just wanna do the thang with me
And who am I to tell that girl no
This world is so cold, why should I be
She don't even wanna be my girlfriend, she just say she just wanna do my thang with me
And she gonna do her thang with me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
I met this bad bitch last month, bonified freak, we been kicken it for the last month
Or should I say, I've been hittin it for the past month
David Blane, magic stickin it for the past month
She got that coke bottle il shape, thicker than a Mcdonalds milkshake
We don't go on dates, we have field days
She let me play on her field, like a Bills game
She don't even like Football, she just sits home
But she love when I run it in her end zone
She love to role play, and put them wigs on
She be gettin her Lil Kim on
With me, she can be as freaky as she is
But with him, she gotta be as sneaky as she is
And with her, I can be as kinky as I'm gonna be
Upside down, handstands, how I wanna be

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, she don't even care about my girlfriend
She say she just wanna do the thang with me
And who am I to tell that girl no
This world is so cold, why should I be
She don't even wanna be my girlfriend, she just say she just wanna do my thang with me
And she gonna do her thang with me
