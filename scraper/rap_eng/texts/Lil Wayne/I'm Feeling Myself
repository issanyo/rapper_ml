Chea, D-Boy in the b-u-I-l-ding
He who buy and sell things
Feds hear my cell ring
Phone we say ice cream
Home we say white
In jail we don't say too much
The codes ain't safe enough
So I be on the street and on the road gettin' my paper up
Full but I ain't ate enough
I'm good but I ain't great enough {uh-uh}
Aye, Drew, turn the faders up
I'm wakin' up
I'm takin' up the industry's space and I'm wastin' 'em
They can't look me in my face cause I'm grillin' 'em {bling}
How my smile worth a mill-I-on? {Ha}
Because
Diamonds are forever
Pluck a diamond from the bezzle
Feel the clarity that twinkle on the Lil One
Now get 'em
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' it
I'm feelin' myself
Aye what is this, feelin'?
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' like... you gotta feel me!
I spit
Switchblades for the bitch made
I spit sweet lemonade for the pretty babes {haha}
I spit bullets at hood niggas
Don't get shot
Get low boy! {Boy! }
I spit numbers for the dough boys
And for the dope boys
I tell 'em to meet coke boys
It's more money involved
Sheea
More money
More problems
More problems to solve
Big Gleezy got 'em {Gleezy}!
Ask a nigga have I ever been in the back of a car lookin' for other niggas after dark {real to 'em}
They'll tell you wassup
I ain't bad as f*ck, but I'm tough enough
That's why...
Peole try to tell me shit
But I don't wanna hear 'em
Cause if I tell 'em shit back
Then I'd prob'ly scare 'em
Truth be told I'm the hottest of my era
There will never be a soul that can compare to every level ever pedaled by the devil
Me being the devil
Yup
Hot Boy to the grizzle
Gone til they miss me
And that's until the blunts burn out
And the liquor is empty
I ain't trippin' cause I did me
Wait I'm trippin' cause I'm still me
Still the little nigga goin' out to get me
If the
Public got somethin' to say
Well tell them I got somethin' to say
And that is...
