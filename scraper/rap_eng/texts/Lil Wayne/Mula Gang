[Verse 1: Jay Jones]
Man, starting five when it's game time
Talking drugs on my main line
That's a strange sign, I can't really trust you
Ain't have a clue that I was working so hard to get where I'm at
I can vision this shit, had a dream
Call me Jay Luther King
Now I woke up and I'm living this shit
Time change, people change too
Never let the people change you
Pack made it safe, we straight
Pull off in a cocaine coupe
Got two snow bunnies with me
One Becky one named Sue
Sue don't really do what Becky do
Becky sexual with the crew (gang)
2000 at HollyGrove
This the year of the Mula
I put that on Mula
Pull out the passports, fuck a city hoe
I need a bitch from Aruba
She say my dick like a ruler
She lemme fuck her medulla
Then I pass that hoe to Euro
When it come to head, that hoe better than Super
I'm gone

[Hook: Jay Jones]
Wait, I think I'm made for this shit
I got the way with this shit
Grind everyday for this shit
Every night bad hoes
Shop open no closed
Make money, stack mo
I guess this what they ask fo'
Wait, yeah
Mula Gang
Mula Gang
Yeah, yeah
Mula Gang

[Verse 2: Euro]
Check
I'ma do 'em like Big Meech
This strip club's in '03
Like when MJ dropped 69 on the Cavs in OT
Keith Moore with a low fade
Fiends still in the Stone Age
Goons in the crowd strapped hope
They don't clap while I'm on stage
Side talk, I'm immune to
Been the new kid in the new school
I ain't too fond of the new school
I'm an old soul in a young man
Bump Johnny Cash when I cruise through
Two cokes still a hot boy
But I'm too cool, I'll hold a grudge 'till I beat whoever I lose to
We the ones who had good girls, by the pool snortin' up lines
I'm the reason all the bad college bitches never showed up on time
We the one who had Cristiano in Japan throwing up signs
Born to lose but I built up, always knew growing up
I think I'm made for this shit

[Hook: Jay Jones]
Wait, I think I'm made for this shit
I got the way with this shit
Grind everyday for this shit
Every night bad hoes
Shop open no closed
Make money, stack mo
I guess this what they ask fo'
Wait, yeah
Mula Gang
Mula Gang
Yeah, yeah
Mula Gang

[Verse 3: HoodyBaby]
I'm Steph Curry I'm Wardell
I'm all hell, when the Warriors come out to play yall all fail
I got fish scale, I got four scales
I'm the nigga in the city pushing dope deals
Hoodybaby in the kitchen when the smoke clears
I can clear 200,000 like my throat, yeah
I make it rumble in the jungle where koalas lie
Bitches call me Hoody bear, i'm koala-fied
Oh that went over your head? I'm over qualified
Really make them guns fly, bitch I'm stuck in overdrive
Trick or treat, live or die? Let my bro decide
All this trapping in my Jesus piece like show you right

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
L-A-T
Moms was hard on me with grades
Had to turn them B's to A's
Now im turning words to paper
Turning birds to haters fry their wings and legs
I prefer a leg, I deserve a raise
Should be overpaid, I just toast the bread
I ain't burn the bread
Made it gold instead turning more than heads
Take a lemonhead, turn it into bread
Got the golden dreads, got me on the meds
Had a talk with Tez about me on the meds
Forgot the shit he said, I'm out here on the edge
Don't try to sell me, Reg
I'll knock ya off the ledge
I'll pop off on sketch
Spraying like pledge, bullets gon' spread
Catch 'em like Dez, all in ya ass
Handguns in the console
I'm a shark in the fishbowl
Running plays on my rich hoes
Sunny days in the North Pole
I'm a play, play my part hoe
Turn a rock to the charcoal
Heart throb but my heart cold
Short ride on a long road
Long days and them long nights
Big dogs and we all bite
Big words just all hype
Small talk, large price
Alright, not nice
Heart cold, hot ice
She sucks, she wipes, she swallows, drops mic
Stop light, stop running your mouth 'fore I run in your mouth
From a hundred dollas to a hundred accounts
Got fuckin problems, tryna figure 'em out
Niggas run in your house waiting on my count
Bitches in they house waiting on my call
Mula Gang, Mula Gang, Mula Gang
Yes Lord
I think I'm made for this shit

[Hook: Jay Jones]
Wait, I think I'm made for this shit
I got the way with this shit
Grind everyday for this shit
Every night bad hoes
Shop open no closed
Make money, stack mo
I guess this what they ask fo'
Wait, yeah
Mula Gang
Mula Gang
Yeah, yeah
Mula Gang
Gang, gang
