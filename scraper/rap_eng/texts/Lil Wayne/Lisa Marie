[Verse 1:]
She said her name was Lisa Marie
And she was a beast
Woman so bad it's illegal to speak
She say she like me and she was eager to meet
And I was just as eager as eager as she
Body so sick u can eat off her feet
Go to the hospital die in a week
She say she was a model well obviously
Cause I can sure picture her between my sheets
Baby was a flower w/ rose pedal cheeks
And everytime she talk its like a gold medal speech
Intelligent she should teach
And if so
I will be a nerd like screech

[Bridge:]
I told her I would write a rhyme about her
And it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track she said that's deep
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat

[Hook:]
This is the beat this is this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She she she said her name was Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie [x8]

[Verse 2:]
She said her name was Lisa Marie and she was discreet
Her picture's in the dictionary next to elite
I told her we can get away we can retreat
Cut off my arms put um on her seat
Cut off my legs put um on her head
So I could run thru her mind like she does mine
And everytime she smile it make me feel like a child
In the supermarket on the candy isle
I saw a picture of her w/ her panties down
I fall asleep and dream I'm a camera now
I would love to be the water in her shower
Or one of her bath towels

[Bridge:]
I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track she said that's deep
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat

[Hook:]
This is the beat this is this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She she she said her name was lisa marie
Li-Lisa Marie [x8]

[Verse 3:]
She said her name was Lisa Marie and she was a piece
A piece of fine art like a piece of the leak
She was unique ex-quisite
Like x y z she was complete
And I think she like butterflies
Because she got one on her upper thigh
And her face is like summer time
Birthday the same month as mine w/ a different sign
Virgo I go wherever her go
If she say so I'm on her like a fur coat
In November she colder than December
She got me fallin' like TIMBER!

[Bridge:]
I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track she said that's deep
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat

[Hook:]
This is the beat this is this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She she she said her name was Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie [x8]
