[Intro]
Yeah
Hardbody, hardbody
Carter, Carter, Carter
Yeah, let's go

[Verse]
Cash Money, Young Money, motherfuck the other side
They can fuck with us if they want, I bring 'em homicide
Word to my mama, I'm gon' continue bombin'
Told her getting out the game is like coming out of a coma
I'm trying, but I'm normal, when this rap shit get boring
All I ask is that you pray for me (please!)
And the beat keep crying, and I'ma keep beating her
Fee, I'm fucking her, I'm deep in her, sleep in her
And what happens when the Reaper come?
I'm just hoping that he sends that elevator up
I made enough, I ain't make shit
So while I'm here, I'ma take that and take this
Breakfast, yes; let's eat, wipe your mouth when you finished
Then hunt for the lunch and dinner
No beginner to the criminal activity
Fuck with them, they rushing in like Seminoles, Indians
No bow and arrows, Harold
Just Ninas, Gina — Just choppers, Robert
Carter II, tell me how is you gon' stop a riot?
I lock and seal it, I'm the best, I can feel it
I'm in the lead, I could pop a wheelie
Not for rookies, late bloomers stay in the womb
I'm here motherfucker, make room; boom
Young Tune, the big kahuna
It's my ocean baby, y'all niggas is tuna
Better now than sooner, Junior
Flying 'round your city, tryna take a number two on ya
I ain't going nowhere special, I won't never leave
Shit, I'm already a legend if I ever leave
Can't get rid of me, not little me
Man I got 'em, I'ma get 'em B (I got 'em, B)
I'm hungry like I didn't eat
I want it like I didn't see a mill' before 17
What the fuck you niggas telling me?
You pups can't keep up with the pedigree
Catch me where the weather be
Somewhere in the 70s, call myself settling
Palm trees, promethazine, but, what's new?
Sometimes I can't cut through that rough loop
Get fucked so many times 'til it's "Fuck you"
So, how you wanna do it baby? We can get it
All you gotta do is say it and I'm with it
Money and murder, you my nigga, my jelly preserver
I'ma ride, baby, 'til the judge give me a verdict, yeah
Hear me or heard me, I get it and serve it
'Cause every time I did it, I hit it and hurt it, yeah
Now I kill it, the mission accomplished
The niggas abolished, the bitches astonished
And then they pay homage, when did they find it?
But now that they know it's a must I remind 'em
So they don't forget it, I underline it
And I'm in the sky when the thunder's cryin', young'n
I been through all that, I done done what you sayin'
I put it down when the others was playin'
When the jungle was open, I rolled in with the riders
Stole food from the bears, and brought it back to the lions
Hold court with the apes, I'm a gorilla but lighter
Got the eye of a tiger, the heart of a fighter, yeah
Start 'em, ignite 'em, I walk through fire
Watch the flames start multiplyin', woo, yeah
Alter a nigga, Nina, talk to a nigga
Take a chunk out your body like a shark bit a nigga
I'm awkward like Cartwright, fuck with a nigga
Shot ugly, but my arch right; come on, dawg – bark, bite
Fork in the road, I'm always going right
Nowadays, knowing life, ain't no more road lights
We can't see, but we gon' make it to the finish line
It's right there, the goal line, right behind the scrimmage line
Touchdown, check the scoreboard, gimme mines
Semi-9 fit me fine, hit a nigga twenty times
Damn, then one more to the face (Bow!)
Just so they close the casket like I pay to close the case
I'm made, straight Mafia shit, front line, top rank
Ready to die for my shit, and the obvious shit –
If I talk about my rivalry they probably get rich
So fuck 'em, I'ma let 'em sit
And I ain't ducking 'cause I'm right here, I'm just enough
I don't care who at the top of the stairs, I'm stepping up
See you fucking up the money, baby, and that ain't good business
You're starting to look like a witness
And this is for the gangstas and the bitches
The hustlers and the hoes
Crossover? Whatever – Mainstream? No
'Cause Wayne thinks silent, Wayne'll never fold
You heard it right here if the game was ever told
Lift up your toes, and look under a rug
Trust me, that's history under all that dust
So deep down in the dirty, there lies us
Yeah, Cash Money Records, and I'm still up front
Stunna, pop a bottle, baby, peel us a blunt
Let's eat and talk about all of the niggas we cut
But, you know what? Let's not fuck up our lunch
That's real shit if you ever seen such, church
Tha Mobb, nigga
