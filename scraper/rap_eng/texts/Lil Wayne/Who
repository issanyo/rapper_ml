[Intro]
Who? Nigga who? Who?
(I took the jet to Dubai)
(I took the jet to Milan)
Who? Nigga who?

[Pre verse 1]
I pop a xan and chill
I buy some land and chill
I pour up the deuce, promethazine juice
And sip it like chamomile
I got that whip appeal
No I got that dick appeal
My bitch ain't Brazilian
But I could bet she look way better than Miss Brazil

[Verse 1]
I took the jet to Dubai
I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet way to Africa
Shout out my nigga Akon
Oh yes, the bitches was on me
Yeah, they be respecting my mind, shit
I had a heck of a time
I got a check for my time
I David Beckham with dimes
That mean I kick it with bad ones
They put cocaine on they arm
And then they snort it when they dabbin
Hoody lying, bout he fasting
These hoes lying 'bout they juicin'
These niggas lying 'bout they stacks
Producers lying 'bout producin'

[Pre verse 2]
These artists lying 'bout they music
Me, I'm still the best rapper
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope a bitch nigga try
I know these bitch niggas spyin'
I put that dick in her spine
I fuck that bitch in her prime

[Verse 2]
I know these bitches is dyin'
Just to be a rich nigga bride
But I tell her I'm not the one
Not the two, nor the three, four or five
I'm 'bout to eat me a juug
I'm 'bout to twist me some good
I'm in here sippin', I'm good
If it ain't Actavis then its uhhh
And my bitch got them lips and they full
And my goons got them clips and they full
And you know 'bout them triggers they pull
Yeah, you know 'bout my niggas. They wolves!
Animal kingdom, I bring them
Don't want my kingpin, I sling em
The eyes don't lie 'till you blink 'em
The iron on my side for the wrinkles
I'm high in the sky and I twinkle
The trap house came with the sprinklers
All of my homies delinquents
You ain't the plug, then you link us

[Chorus 1]
And I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
I don't need Baby for help (Nigga who?)
I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
It's every man for themself, oh Lord
I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
I don't need Baby for help (Nigga who?)
I want Arabian wealth
And I don't need Baby for help, oh Lord

[Pre verse 3]
I could care less 'bout your squad
I throw my set at your squad
I feel the best when I'm high
But these niggas; they blowin my high
I throw a check in the sky
Tell these hoes to get naked and vibe
Your hoe; she sweatin' my squad
Please get the sweat out her eye

[Verse 3]
I'm on a jet so I'm fine
I don't connect when I'm flyin'
Don't get my credit declined
Give all the credit to moms!
Don't get my niggas upset
Don't get ahead of yourself
Cause we cut the head off your neck
And put that bitch on the shelf like a elk ugh
The sheets on my bed are by Ralph
I hate having a bed to myself
And I play em the way they was dealt
I see you drinking that Hatorade, belch
You pussies should play with yourself
You snakes come make me a belt
I want Arabian wealth
And I don't need Baby for help (no)
I don't need Baby for help (no)
I don't need Baby for help (no)
I don't need Baby for help
It's every man for themself Oh Lord
Them niggas playing themselves
I just be playing the field
I just be paying them bills
I'm just a man forreal Oh Lord
And I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
I-I-I don't need Baby for help (Nigga who?)
I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
It's every man for themself Oh Lord
I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
I-I-I don't need Baby for help (Nigga who?)
I want Arabian Wealth
And I don't need Baby for help Oh Lord

[Pre verse 4]
I could care less 'bout your squad
I could care less 'bout your squad
I could care less 'bout your squad
I could care less 'bout your squad
I could care less 'bout your side
I could care less if you ride
I could care less if you die

[Verse 4]
I took the jet to Dubai
I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet to South Africa
Oh yes the weather was fine
Oh yes, the bitches was on me
Yeah, they be respecting my mind, shit
I had a heck of a time
I got a check for my time
I David Beckham with dimes
That mean I kick it with bad ones
They put cocaine on they arm
And then they snort it when they dabbin
Hoody lying, bout he fasting
These hoes lying 'bout they juicin'
These niggas lying 'bout they status
Producers lying 'bout producin'
These artists lying 'bout they music
Me, I'm still the best rapper
And I ain't have to say shit else after that
Gone

[Outro]
I took the jet to Dubai
I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet to South Africa
Oh yes the weather was fine

It's every man for themself Oh Lord
I don't need Baby for help (no)
I don't need Baby for help (no)
I want Arabian wealth
And I don't need Baby for help
Yeah I pop a xan and chill
I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
I could care less 'bout your squad (Nigga who?)
I could care less 'bout your side (who?)
Squad
