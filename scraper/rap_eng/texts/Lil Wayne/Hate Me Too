[Chorus: Lucci Lou]
Bitch, If I was you I'd hate me too
Cause everything that I rock be new
On point when it come to the jewels
When the light hit the rock, turn blue
If I was you, I would hate me too (me too)
Everything a nigga ride be smooth (skrrt)
I came down in the drop-top coupe
If I was you, I would hate me too

[Verse 1: T@]
Pull up in the Porsche, nigga
Tires skinny, but my pockets fat
Hoes be like "Who is that nigga?"
Chef Boy Young Money T@
Young Delta, fly all day, every day
If you got a plug, I can probably beat the rate
Maybe money, but them hoes I’d never chase
We eatin', money coming fast, we ain't sayin’ Grace
200 in a mattress, nigga fuck Chase
Lou got the Jesus piece with the pink face
All black coupe, ain't got nothin' to do with race
If I ever go to trial, I'ma beat the case
I'ma beat that pussy up, and I'ma fuck her face
Never-never gave a fuck what a nigga say
Gettin' money is something I'ma always do
Been fly, still fly, no Jet Blue

[Chorus: Lucci Lou & T@]
Bitch, If I was you I would hate me too
Everything a nigga ride be smooth (skrrt)
I came down in the drop-top coupe
If I was you, I would hate me too
Bitch, If I was you I’d hate me too
Cause everything that I rock be new
On point when it come to the jewels
When the light hit the rock, turn blue

[Verse 2: Lucci Lou]
I pull up in the ’Lac, nigga
I'm sittin’ low, but I'm high as fuck
They like "Who the fuck is that nigga?"
Lucci Lou, and he bout his bucks
Been gettin' money since a lil nigga
Now I'm all grown up, but I still get it
In this rap shit, man a nigga livin’
If I said it then I saw it, or a nigga did it
Yeah
I see why they hatin' on me
All they hoes wanna date me
Bitch I'm a G, and boy I come straight out that East
Yeah, that's the home of the beast
New whip, color cocaine, nigga
36 for the whole thing, nigga
I drive around in your hoe Range, nigga
Your married bitch is my new dame, nigga (hah!)

[Skit]
God damn, man
Who that is pulled up in the spaceship like that, man?
That Lil Wayne!
Man, he still balling like that, man?
I don't like that shit at all, man
Damn, look how the doors open!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh-
The bando poppin' like a club, too
Bitch in the kitchen on her one's and two's
I feel like Tarzan on his jungle juice
I feel like a drug lord, a kingpin
You should kneel down, kiss the ring then
Sit the drink down, pour the lean in
Then I sit down, and dream a Genie
Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star
We got work from here to Mars
Hit the kitchen, kiss the floors
Givin' bitches dick of ours (yeah)
We got guns behind the bar
Shoot the club up, and find the car
Spark a blunt up and find remorse
Make the sign of the cross, then we ridin' off (damn)
Fat pockets, and they gotta eat
But they started smaller than Olive Oil (yeah)
I could take sand to the beach, and I could fuck around and play Volleyball
And I am not worn, and not tired at all, but you gon see diamonds everytime I yawn
Don't hate me, hate the high I'm on, that's why I'm on, get your YM on, muthafucka

[Chorus: T@ & Lucci Lou]
Bitch, If I was you I'd hate me too
Cause everything that I rock be new
On point when it come to the jewels
When the light hit the rock, turn blue
Bitch, If I was you I would hate me too
Everything a nigga ride be smooth (skrrt)
I came down in the drop-top coupe
If I was you, I would hate me too
