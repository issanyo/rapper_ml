[Verse 1: Wale]

It's the return of the ambassador heard you bammas sassin'
Now I'm laughin' cause I'm passing ya
Yeah
And bammas rap but, they lack the passion for it
They lack the vision young Folarin now can labrador em
I reel them in, Goadomes on see
I'm on my scott storch staying clear of Timbalands
Yea
I be clever no thug but the street love em
YBM and EMP it's like we brothers
And peace Harlem and the Dipset phenomena
D.C. got you we got them like you got 'em on... yeah
Yea my fan base pilin' on... yeah
My haters need Tylenol
And by the way I seen the iTunes hatin'
I think it's more racist than ratings
Anyways give it up the capital the nation
Where weapons similar to dry grapes
Or babies they raisin

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

If it's bullshit you want, bullshit I shall
Yea I'm a kick it off nigga heads and tails
Red lobster everyday shrimp heads and tails
And bad bitches give me head and tail
And bad bitches give me head and tell
See I'm ahead but you stay the snail
I move they see the back of my Nikes
Got to the end of the tunnel
And I was the light
Always strapped so I was alright
Naked woman rub my back
And ask me how was my night
I say 'bitch stay out of my business'
When we fuck she say
'Just stay out of my kidneys'
I say 'don't say it if Simon didn't'
And America idolize a nigga
But they better cause bitch I'm me
And you are you too, but bitch I'm three
I be

[Verse 3: Wale]

The revolution has arrived
Luchador like I been masked but still remain fly
That's flyer than a wrestler, you don't want to mess with
Young Rey Mysterio mixed with Chavo Guerrero
Flyer than the rest of them make 'em all remember me
Make 'em all similar to mind of an elephant
Mine reeks excellence y'all reeks estrogen
Everybody know me like the Contra code for extra men
Beyond the extremities of every one and anyone
Train of thought running like it's Kenyan I carry on
Been in more beef than Jerry Yum's, I buried 'em
Always next to Madness like Kenyon, carry on
Flyer them the rest I told you I'm ish
Watch me exercise my excrement while sending messages
DMV's messenger love it so I'm reppin' it
Hail to the Skins rest in peace Sean Taylor 1
