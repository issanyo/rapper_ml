Fo' fo' bulldog, my motherfucking pet
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker fetch
I'm fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call it triple threat
When I was in jail she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death
Top down, it's upset, been fucking the world and nigga I ain't come yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepare for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep so Weezy can't rest
An AK47 is my fucking address, huh

[Rick Ross]
I'm not a star, somebody lied I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car

[Lil Wayne]
Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them where it hurts
Cause if I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

[Rick Ross]
Big black, and an icey watch
Shoes on the coupe, that got a Nike shop
Counts the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans kick em off they might high, swish!
I'm swimming in a yellow bitch, boss
In the red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof till he got hit the fifth time
Drop ?
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I'm the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected I got killers in Chicago

[Rick Ross]
I'm not a star, somebody lied I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car

[Lil Wayne]

Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them where it hurts

[Lil Wayne]
Talk stupid get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch I'm red fox
Big b's, Red Sox
I get money to kill time, dead clocks
Your fucking with a nigga who don't give a fuck
Empty the clip, then roll the window up
Pussy niggas sweet, you niggas cinnabun
I'm in a red bitch, she said she finna come
200 thou on a chain, I don't need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E
Five letters, YMCMB
Bitch ass Nigga, pussy ass nigga
I see ya looking, with your looking-ass nigga
You know the rules, kill em all and keep moving
If I died today it'd be a holiday

[Rick Ross]
I'm not a star, somebody lied I got a chopper in the car
So don't make it come alive
Rip ya apart than I put myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever
The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gon bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, pocket gain and 40 bricks
Son of a bitch, than I made a great escape
Ain't it funny momma, only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm santa claus
Niggas gather round, I got gifts for all of y'all
Take it home and let it bubble thats the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up
It's a cold World I need a bird to cuddle up
I call the plays, muthaf-ck huddle up

[Lil Wayne]
I'm not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
Yeah
