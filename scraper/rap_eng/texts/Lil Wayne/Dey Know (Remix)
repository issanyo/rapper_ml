[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
Yeah, Shawty Lo and the Big Cats
Yeah, it's the remix so bring your top hat
What you talking bout, it's L-O
I rap now it's rap schizo
Thirty bands, fo shizzo
Eight balls same price as the kilo
I'm a boss, handle my B-I
And I got them same kinda guns like T.I
See I been that way since knee high
Real dope boys so you know I trap or dizzi
No lizzi, I'm hizzi
Like Kells I believe I can flizzy
And yeah I'll see you later
Big ups to all my haters

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Guard your woman dawg or I'll take her
You'll hear her scream from College Park to Decatur
I was a snotty nose with no paper
Now my crib sittin on twenty-two acres
Get it right fool I gets money (yep)
If you think Luda's not filthy you's a dummy (yep)
I was allergic to the roof on the cutty
So I took the top off like a Playboy Bunny
Catch me pimpin in a robe and some slippers
Riding down 85 while I'm stunting on my Gixxer
Mouth full of swishers or riding with your sister
And six David Beckhams or a trunk full of kickers
Take a picture of the mister it'll last long
And these haters get stretched out like a bad thong
So partner mash on or get mashed up
Think you can fuck with Luda then put a million of your cash up

L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I'm in my Cool Whip, inside's Jello
Hop up out that pretty muthafucka like hello
(Hello) Hello, ladies how you doing
That nigga crazy girl, don't say nothin to him
They know they know I got white low low
Rob who, take what (gun cocks) hello
They know I give a fuck about them haters
Young jizzle been getting paper
Granite, wheels on the coup like savors
Hit da club with twenty broads like Flava
I'm on the top floor no neighbors
Who you kidding I get my 87's tailored

[Verse 4: Plies]
Went from two ounces to a Maserati
First rap check bought choppers for everybody
Before they know what's under my shirt the Glock 40
Get twenty-five a show next month I want forty
Born a real nigga but I die a goon
Just bought a new choppa gon use it real soon
Got the streets on lock homie I can't lose
Put me anywhere I'm the realest nigga in the room
Take a look at me I'm what you call street approved
Got a lot haters but even more tools
I play dumb homie but neva been a fool
Cut my dog off I heard he snitchin too

[Hook]
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know

[Verse 5: Lil' Wayne]
Now what I look like
And if it ain't money then I don't look right
And that don't sound right
I swear you can get a full clip not a sound bite
SU-WU gang and if you ain't with it then you in the food chain
I'm in that wide body I'm a need two lanes
Blue seats white paint wetter than new rain
Like a white person with blue veins
I keep a black Glock red dot blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game
Cause all my kicks fly like Liu Kang
Old player new game
I'm focused I'm thinking like I got two brains
I'm in my prime I feel like a new Wayne
How come there is two women but ain't no two Waynes
I don't know what you do but I do thangs
It's Mr. Every-Time-You-See-Me-Got-A-New-Chain
My flow crazy I ain't too sane
But I am the shit and they just poop stain

[Hook]
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know
