[Hook]
Chinese AK just do what I say and nobody die
I open the soda, I get the codeine and I pour up a lot
I pour up a lot, I pour up a lot
Me and my niggas, we go up a lot
We so up, you not
D'usse, D'usse, when I get home I'mma throw up these shots
When I got home I was so drunk I knocked
So drunk I knocked and the door was unlocked
Went in the kitchen and grabbed me a pop
Got my codeine and I poured up a lot
I pour up a lot

[Verse 1]
I pour up a lot
I got more than a doc, my soda gonna pop
Strong as boulders and rocks
My shoulders gon' drop, you know I know I'm so high
I could have swore I saw Pac
Could have swore I saw Spock
My motor don't stop
I stay on my feet, no hole in my socks
You know I'm on deck, when there's snow, I'm on top
I'm stored up on stock
I'm way up, but I'm sure you're not shocked
Cause you know how I rock
And you know that it's cocked
The .44 with the dot
I'm a pro with the Glock, don't you go to the cops
Or your throat gon' get chopped
Then your folks gon' get got then your ho gon' get shot
Kiss that ho if she hot
Hitting notes on my cock like Do Re Mi Fa
And all you lookin' ass niggas look at me now
I'm sure you gon' watch, you boring, I'm not
I'm scoring a lot, ignoring the thots
I'm pouring a lot, taste like euphoria, uh
Russian AK, do what I say and nobody die
I open the soda, I get the codeine and I pour up a lot
I pour up a lot
I sew up the block, make you go off the block
I'm getting twisted with 2 bad bitches in my bedroom
Leave them hoes in a knot
Stomach in knots, thought I need some drank
I'm stuck in my bed and the dopeman said all he got is red
If I don't do red, Lord, I don't do red
I don't do yellow, no, I don't do that
I don't do Qualitest, I don't do Hi-Tech
I need that Act
I don't do yellow cause it make me scratch
As soon as I seen niggas sippin' green
I was like, "where they do that"
Bring that shit back, let me bring this shit back

[Hook]
Chinese AK do what I say and nobody die
My soda so dirty, I can't even lie
When I need peace of mind I just pour up a lot
I pour up a lot
Me and my niggas, we go up a lot
We so up, you not
D'usse, D'usse, when I get home, I'ma throw up these shots
When I got home I was so drunk I knocked
So drunk I knocked and the door was unlocked
Went to the kitchen and grabbed me a pop
Didn't even measure, just poured up a lot
I pour up a lot

[Verse 2]
I run in your building and hold up the spot
Give me what you got, the keys and the gwuap
Make everyone get on their knees and then count
My bitch talking 'bout kicking me out
Cause every time she want the soda we out
Bitch, I don't want no lip, I just want some mouth
I just want a sip, I don't wanna drown
I just want the lean, I don't wanna bounce
I just wanna chill, I don't want a crowd
I just want my check, I don't want a trial
I just want some neck, I don't want no mouth
She just wanna love, I just want lounge
I just smoke loud, she just drink brown
I just drink purple, she just smoke hookah
Quit cigarettes, concerned â€˜bout her future
I pour up a lot, past, present, future
Syrup and sprite, turn that shit fuschia
Hawaiian Punch, Alo-hallelujah
We got that white girl workin' like Hooters
My shooters don't listen
I tell 'em you cool, but still they don't listen
I cut on the news, and they say you missin'
And I can't stop grinnin' like, "nigga, we did it"
And they show police fishin'
And searching under bridges when they say no witness
I start hopping around like Jiminy Cricket
And I can't stop sippin'
And she can't stop stripping
Cause she got an infant and her man in prison
Lord, she can't stop ventin'
And I can't stop drifting, she worry a lot
And I pour me a lot
I pour up a lot, I pour up a lot
Don't know how to stop, I don't know how to stop so
I pour up a lot, pour up a lot
I pour up so much I don't know it's a lot
I pour more than a lot, I go over the top

[Outro]
(Oohh boy)
Yeah, again and again, etcetera
I pour, I pour up in
Cream  soda, Sprite, Seven-Up
Fuck it, here we go again
Medicine, medicine, yeah
I need that, I need script
I don't need no discount, I leave you a tip
They said that Actavis dead, that's bullshit
Well if so then I must be the exorcist
I don't know what you heard but you heard wrong
I got a swamp up in my Styrofoam
It can be room temperature or lukewarm
All I need is ice to make the perfect storm
I pour up a lot
