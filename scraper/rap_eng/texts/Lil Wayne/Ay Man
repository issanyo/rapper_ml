[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Lemme 'splain the difference 'tween you and I
Hot in Miami but you know I keep the coolest ride
Stop like yeah ragged rockin' [? ]
Pullin' up on the side is a suicide
Aye, you just a run-of-the-mill nigga
Here's the difference man I run with the mills, niggas can't eat I ain't done with the meal
See dem niggas that's grinnin' man they have fun with da steel
"Pharrell, you a cool nigga. Let me shake your hand. You wear tight pants, you wear black bands, you wear long Vans, crib in the sky and
I heard you got a crib in Virginia, on the sand."
Not you, you ain't a Robb Report nigga
Nigga, yous a perjuror, you lie in court nigga
You prolly snitchhy snitchy and proly bitchy bitchy
I don't wear them big chains no mo' because they itch me
Drop my girl off, pick up the enzo
Ridin' through Hileah, ride through Kendall
Ride through Carol City, ride through Overtown
Where they leave dat ass on the ground
But you say that they know you now
But the difference is when dey see ya, will they hold ya down
See P grew up with a heroine pedal?
They made fun of me cause I was a odd fellow
See I was half skate park I was half ghetto
But you cut me open then u seen my bones made of metal
Here's my DNA yes it was essential
Unlike your aftermarket Roley Presidential
Look at my Audemars, three hundred something
Barack inspired (why?) the black one comin'

[Pre-Hook: Lil Wayne]
Pu-Pull up in that new thang all mellow

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm doin' real well I'm doin' real well
Got the Frank Mull and time will tell
Rock star bitch, like a Nine Inch Nail
Som'n sittin' on 25 inch wheels
We eatin' over here why would I miss meals?
Whisper in her ear give her thigh lip chills
Young moolah yeah I know you like dat baby
And she wanna be in the mix like a white-black baby
Weezy a.k.a. which one of ya'll girls want me
High-definition tv in the front seat
Whatcha wanna do nigga I ain't neva scared
Theodore ass nigga you a teddy bear

Thank god black card good everywhere
You like my shoes huh? well I got every pair
Elevator eyes, but I get every stair

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I'm doin' real fine I'm doin' real fine
It took a lil' time it was just a hill climb
And now we at the top so let's pose for the pictures
Cause our money longer than the nose of da bitches?
And, and for my shows do ya know what I'm gettin'?
Like a mansion every night it's fair to say I make a livin'
And hip hop never closed it just wasn't safe to visit
But I reopened it I'm bout to break the ribbon
I see it and I'm in it I do it how you dreamt it
Ice game dumber than O.J. Simpson
I ride next year check the numbers on the temps and
Hotta than a bitch check the numbers on my temp and ya boyfriend a bitch watch I treat him like a wimp and
We are all apes I remember when we were chimps and man, you can bet I'm gon' be limpin
