I'M GOING IN LYRICS

[Verse1 Acelyric]

I tied dat bitch doesn my rhymes
Are confusing
Catch me in town smoking on Cubans
Hater pull me down but Der da 1s
Loosing
First mixtape (yo) dame it's so
Smoothing
Yeh am on drugs, my chick need a Mug, finger 2 hard she just asked For a hug if my dick juicy, get
Ready 2 suck
Man you niggers gay get ur Eyebrows plucked
Wen i throw my lyrics at you get ready to duck
I keep u going all day like a
Fucking clock,my push so hard it starts a blood clot

[Chorus1 LilWayne]

I'm going in, I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard

Bitch, I'm going in, I'm going in

And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard

[Verse2 Spencer D]

Am going in like a tempan
Only difference is zer is no zero this is
My on gang of a psycho
I heard there was a Ohio rap
His name was milo
I compared his written
To my own freestyles yo
Obviously i was better
I give it to you fully
Like an open letter
Paper like a hater lighter
Than feather girl got finger
By some sharp nail
Always having a escape route
You can't fuck me in jail
Am always on the wrong
But i never fail, send my message to your state or mine to mine mail
And if he talk shit
I will collapse the holy grill
Could try try this is me Bye bye moutherfuckers
Spencer D am in da house am a lion u a mouse
Nigga what you talkin about

[Chorus2 LilWayne]

And Imma go hard, and Imma go hard
