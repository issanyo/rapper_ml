[Hook]
I'm whipping that tan that Chico DeBarge
I'm wheeling and dealing that Chico DeBarge
Stay with that water water, stacking up dough
For my daughter, daughter, See 88 the new world order
I got yo bitch and she takin' orders

[Verse 1: Roy DeMeo]
Just took a L for a 50 pack, give me some time
I'ma get it back, she gon hold up the tires like running flat
These niggas be wired can't fuck with that
Trunk in the front with a duffel bag (duffel bag)
I been had the hoes, you still cuffin' that?
Keep a young bull to go get the sack
Stay with two 9s like you Warren Sapp
Came out the section where niggas had nothing
I hustle right where the vultures at
I'm never gon' put my trust in no woman
That's just the line where I cross it at
We washing that money like laundromats
We washing that money like laundromats
They done fucked around and freed up El Chapo
I call up Zay tell'em gas up the Tahoe
We gon' get the Guapo

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I got some pushers, run through New Orleans
I got a play to make in the morning
I got some niggas that be bout' the business
Make a phone call and they pull up on ya
I hit the road in a new Honda Civic
Flew back straight from California
DeMeo the kingpin and I told you I live this shit
Have the judge drop the Mallet on you (yeah)
Whipping that Chico, yelling free Chico
Got my lil nigga he straight from the bottom
The bottom, got hit with the R.i.c.o
I keep a tool when I ride through the bottom
And I dont know none of these people
Work came in lightskin like a chica
Hot Boy and im hot while you regular

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I just got bitches on top of bitches
I just got chickens on top of chickens
Everyone know that my Papa chicken
Them niggas tried to 2pac a nigga
But fuck it, bomb on my enemies on my enemies
Fuck it bomb on my enemies on my enemies, fuck it Chico De
Fuck it bomb on my enemies on my enemies, bomb on my enemies on my enemies
Was that buzzing? A swarm of them killer B's
I am the fatherless son of Mrs. Billy Jean
And got a killer team,  got a guillotine
And we 17, all seven days, with the sand-sand
With the water-water, and like a beach babe the coke catching waves
That's white girl with a tan, I'm the lifeguard of the trap
I've done seen so many shark attacks
Life is Too Short: Born to Mack
Nigga tried to sell me water whip
I ain't call em' back, I bought it back
That's why I rather buy it soft
And cook it up myself now how hard was that? (Damn)
I'm whipping that Chico Debarge!
I got a 3 car garage, and still got shit all in the driveway
Moving the snow like a bobsleigh
Whip it with water it hydrate, these niggas is salty as phosphate
My pupils is starting to dilate, we go MMA on MDMA
Kidnap the D.A. then the DOA
We don't give a fuck bout what P.O. say
Chico get the Yae and we A-okay
I make sure Nae Nae and Miss Cita straight
DeMeo he did the Gambino way
Lil Tunechi I live the Carlito way
Free Tha Carter 5, free the base!
I'ma see a way, either way keep the faith Chico De'
Ain't tryna get hit with that Rico play
That's why we out here playing *Keep away*
That AK so long we abbreviate, I mix it up quick like a PB J
I’m over the stove in my Pj’s, I got that smoke and that DeRay
I whip that D. Bo, I don't need Craig
I'm on a roll I don't need legs
No such thing as "I don't need meds"
Extra Xan bars for the sleep heads
Sell Adderall to the Pre-Meds
Molly active on the College campus
The dog food got the Chihuahua's braggin'
You lolly gaggin', I'm powder baggin'
Styrofoam full of Cotton candy
Now I'm gone cause I'm tired of rappin...
