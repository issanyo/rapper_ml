[J.Gutter]
Skinny nigga but my pockets stay fat as fuck
Man my whole Sqad hoppin out a Caddy trucks
And plus I'm like A.I. I'm tryen to snatch and bust
Got a bright grill got these bitches actin up
Wit a mean mug got these niggas backing up
Kicked up dub truck sittin high as fuck
Eyes shut can't duck cuz I'm high as fuck
I don't kno ya sellin bricks till ya high as fuck

[Young Yo]

[Peanut]
Come and get wit it ya fuckin wit tha lil black filth

Lil Peanut just thanked him
Ball like Theo Ratliff

[Dizzy]
It don't matter who get hit, I shoot nuns up
Tha life of Dizzy a true story give me 2 thumbs up
I runs up slanted grill wit 2 guns up
Slangin bullets like 2 nun chucks
I simply could flip niggas
Get a grip niggas, don't trip niggas
I dun turned gangstas ta bitch niggas
My name ringin like a dead singer
Tha head banger, givin hatas tha mid finga

[Lil' Wayne]
Ya kno it wouldn't be right wit out tha boy
Let me speak on it...
Keep heat underneath tha seats up in tha jeep
Wit tha feet chrome it no retreat when tha beef on me
I'm to deep in tha streets homie
Put tha trees and tha leaves for me
And tha leaves to relieve on me
No seed just proceed to blow weed and mo weed
So high I dat I got a nose bleed
.4-5 n tha cozy, 4-5 that im toastin
Nuttin but G's up in here and I swear I returned one wit tha most pos wit tha crow team
So I get more cream
Long ride in tha hoes spleen
Got a hoe on tha floor givin me a blow job and its so mean
And if I told you who you'd be so confused
But don't mind gatta whole week
Don't mind I'm a hoe king
One line make a hoe dream
One time make a hoe drink
Get her to tha crib make tha hoe eat
Then make tha bitch fuck tha whole street
Dude rich but he's so street
Fuck a bitch yea I'm O.B
Neva snitched ta tha police
Representin ole peeps
Say shit like whodi
See I'm wit ya
If ya ain't neva seen a G snap picture
Cuz mutha fucker you can believe I'm that nigga
Run from tha dude cuz he will clap quicker than a mutha fucker
He may be a rap nigga but tha boy gutta
17th to tha boy unda gatta think 17th til tha boy unda
And if ya neva knew then now ya that's how I go
That's S.Q.A.D. Up ya
What tha fuck

[Lil' Wayne Talking]

And one more thing, suck my dick bitch
