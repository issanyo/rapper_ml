[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Too many women and not enough time
I'm a cool cat but I'm on life nine
Pimping ain't dead cause I be the life line
And I don't buy the bar cause it don't sell white wine
Go on, let that light shine, balling for a life time
Smoking on that nice pine, Weezy baby, flight flyin'
You can call him your husband, call me at night time
And even though women change I will always like dimes
And yeah I'm quite fine but shorty much finer
And I just get behind her then smack it like E. Honda
And please don't hate on me when you see me with Kiana
Cause she's wilder than Nirvana and colder than your honor
Holla at yo' boy mañana, Maybach come wit a recliner
Run up on me and shit will get uglier than an iguana
This is only a reminder, it's Young Money don't forget it
And I'm Weezy F baby, you might find it on her titty would you

[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my polo tee, Gucci sweat pants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
Chilling wit my posse 'bout to call some ladies over
Tell them this is YME so when you come you can't leave sober
You would think she came with buttons by the way that I control her
Put her on a tab now she rolling like a baby stroller
I’m the freshest niggas seen, weapon in my jeans
Shoot your lights out, I’m like Redick with the beam
Life's a game of chess and I'm heading for your queen
Not my stomach and my thighs but her head is in between
She wetter than a stream I drink medicine to lean
Keep a cup in my hand like I'm begging for some cheese
I fall off in the party yeah I'm kinda tardy
But if a hater trip we ride on him like a Harley
Look you call it getting married I call it acting selfish
My belt got G's on it like a packers helmet
And I'mma hit if you bring your girl around
But the weed is like my collar, cos' I might just turn it down if you

[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my polo tee, Gucci sweat pants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Tool on deck I'm new born fresh
I knock ya friends down and you going next
Young money fly nigga all the bitches after me
Murdered in the bed and you gone be my next casualty
Automatic stick but I give it to her manually
I'm givin dick out year round and you can get it anualy
Styrofoam filled with a strawberry fanta treat
Leaning I'mma need a kick stand to stay on my feet
Get out my business like I kicked ya out my office
I ain't worried bout the price I'm more concerned with the offer
Fresh to death like I got dressed in a coffin
With a party in my pocket blue and red dolphins
I'm high as a motherfucker lemme do my thang bitch
I'm doing me and your girl doin the same shit
I'm in the car getting head as our lanes switch
Double G I do my thang bitch now you could

[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my polo tee, Gucci sweat pants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man

[Verse 4: Drake]
I told you catch up did you make a mill yet
I can't predict how many of them I can still get
October's Own, its such a fucking real set
No tats but the ink on my money still wet
Life is such a beach it's sandy all around me
I came here with Young Money man that's family all around me
I'm in my living room and I got Grammy's all around me
And famous bitches doing nose candy all around me
Welcome to the life
The life is meant for me
My Bentley has a tint and so you got to squint to see
I hollered at your girl that's when she went with me
But please don't blame yourself cause it just wasn't meant to be
They say I'm one of the illest ask yourself for first impressions
And my cards always accepted, I don't deal well with rejection
I look in the dictionary and don't see the word recession
I don't smoke in public but tonight I'll make an exception so just

[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my polo tee, Gucci sweat pants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man
