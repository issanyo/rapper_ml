[Intro:Lil Wayne]
I get high, high, high, high
Word

[Verse 1:Lil Wayne]
I do this when I wanna mama
I hustle when its hotter
Money gun weed & a water bottle
I'm the coolest in the sauna mama
I ain't sweating it,I'm betting it,I'll make it back tomorrow mama
I got corner honor
Ain't been to court since 2004
Looks like I got it going ya honor
I'm a lone rider, grind for my own dollars
They was in front but I'm blowing by em,[??]
I'm on hoes like cornrows, open toes
Fake titties, yes, I bought both of those
Hold ya nose, I'm the shit can't be flushed
I got the toiled stopped up call the plumber up
My stomach stuffed
That's right I'm eating
I smoke the best weed look like I'm sleeping
Cook it by this evening, off it by the morning
Professional dope boy, my office is the Carter

[Bobby Byrd Sample:]
You don't know, what you do

[Verse 2:Lil Wayne]
Yes I do,& I do it better than most
My competitive drive knock a nigga off the road
Lock & load, pull the triggers and roll
The bigger ya mouth, the bigger the hole
We figured em out, them niggas is hoes
Yeah they lawn chairs baby quicker to fold
But me I'm quick on my toes I remember the code
You need a pass for the hood, watch me get through the toll
I been through the cold, I shot through the fire
Still rock too much ice, should've got you a visor
I pull up, the bitches flock & admire
Fresh like I just stepped out of a dryer
Yes!
No fret,I got the lock of a lion
Its eagle street ho, the whole block is behind me
Stay low, the cops is spying
But they could never figure out the rocket science
No pocket knife, no pocket iron
Pots and pans make the pockets wider
Dig em a hole, let the property hide em
Build a house and throw a party over your dead body
Never said I'll never fail, but never dropped an assignment
Gotta finish what you start or the cops'll find it
Dinner in the park, yeah may seem cool
But me,I'd rather not let them see my food
I'm staying strapped like fila shoes
Bet I bust the motherfucker till the enemy move
C'Mon!
Its my game nigga get in & lose
Y'all niggas never do what I do, I do me
