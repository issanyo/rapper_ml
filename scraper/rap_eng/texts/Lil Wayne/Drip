[Hook]
Yeahhh better calm down
Bow down, I draw down
I fire rounds
Drip (x15)

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
OK, monkey nigga, bet not slip, feed your ass banana clips
Yeah, I bust your head gasket, leave you with a oil drip
And for the lettuce AK's, that will spit your cabbage
And shit get tragically, leave cadavers filled with maggots
This ain't angus beef, you don't wanna order this
2 Glocks like 2Pac, I’m on my thug immortal shit
GPS goons show up to your coordinates
Chrome with the pearly, take you early, that's abortion bitch
Duck, duck, tape ya, wrap ya nigga, no balls
Throw slugs the same size as door knobs
Sixty seconds in and out pop, no prob
Blow ya whole face off, that's a blowjob
Shoot ya bitch in the throat leave her voice raspy
Too graphic?, I paint a picture so ya'll niggas grasp it
I call your momma, tell her pre-order ya fuckin' casket
Bury scary niggas, I never buried a hatchet

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Soo woo to the bee-hive, strapped like T.I
I keep that bitch on me, like the Book of Eli
I just shoot ‘em all, so I don’t have to decide
Split your body up, they gotta bury ya ass 3 times
Run up in ya house, leave ya brains on the couch
Shoot up everything, fuck is aimin' about?
Empty that clip, than that bitch slide out
Continue that procedure till them pussy’s dried out
I'm a east side gangsta, I ain't never been a busta
Nina is a cold black bitch, but I trust her
I don't need a psychic to tell me I’m a hustla
Cause bitch, I’m all about my paper, like Usher

[Hook]

[Yung Joc]
I know Chris, decepticon clips transform ya
Leave niggas, ghost activity, paranormal
My piece of the pie, ha ha ha, Digorno
Bullets burn, make em dance, disco inferno

[Lil Wayne]
Back to the subject, i’ll kill ya in a heart beat
I put bullet holes in everything except the car seat
Young money bitch, I shoot one gun and switch
When the cops came the body still twitched (still twitched)

[Yung Joc]
Keep thuggin, you cute, you just flirtin' with death
That's a straight suicide, don’t bury yourself
Scared but can’t run, that's the stall factor
And if that automatic rap I bet they all scatter
Haiti earthquake ‘em, make they wall shatter
Penetrate your lungs and splatter they gallbladders

[Hook]
