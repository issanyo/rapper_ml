[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, man (ever man, ever man)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, man (ever man, ever man, ever man)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shit nigga, this what I does
I swear I ain't lyin', like this is my cubs
This is my club, and I'm dirtied in the summer bitch
Weezy F Baby, always lookin' like I've done some shit
You ain't know nothin' bitch, better know who you fuckin' with
Try to fuck me, I kill you and who you comin' with
No [?], T I had to go stupid
I'm on them high heels and I am no bootsy
Hounds Avenue, ridin' with the Phantom roof gone
The Maybach two-tone, and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24s boy, what are you on?
I'm richer than a bitch without that grey coupon
Yeah, I'm talkin' out of my head
I make a blue-eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a blood motherfucker, a blood motherfucker
Forever like E T C period motherfucker

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, man (ever man, ever man)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, man (ever man, ever man, ever man)

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm so unsigned, it would blow one's mind
'Cause to every single record, I am so unkind
There are no holds barred, there is no love lost
Nigga this that crack, and you know drugs cost so P A Y U P
I don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me, never L I E
I got everything I tell 'em I got
This young nigga showboat like I'm sellin' a yacht
You heard me?
Who else tryna smoke? Yeah nigga, me too
'Cause take my mind off the pressure is what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a Ski-Doo
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down ho, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm goin' in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that Tanner?

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, man (ever man, ever man)
