[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fills the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fills the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
