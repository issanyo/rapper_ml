When I would think about retiring
Uhh...I look at retirement like, I look at retiring like
You retire out when you die out
Straight up, cause you never retire out what you do
You never retire out of what you do
Meaning, if you put so much into--if what you do is your life, like mine
You know what I mean like, my career is my life
So I could never retire out, even when I stop rapping
I'm going to still be in some kind way or form or fashion in it
You know what I mean like
When I die there's going to be rappers at my funeral, hopefully
You know what I mean
But, you know what I mean that's just how it is
Or, y'all gonna remember that that was a rapper
But hopefully, I'll go down known for something different--
Not different, but known for something else also, you know what I mean
But that's what I'm going to do, hopefully
I know what I'm going to do, I'm that nigga man
