Ok, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous
I say I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin, and slurpin my syrupin
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain
I see you turning up with your turn up ain't workin Ok, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous

Ok I swear to God I ain't nervous
Look you eye to eye in verses
And you know I go harder on this track
Then on the CD you just purchased
I am calm like suburbans
And I dont care what version
Your call: Clean or Dirty
I'll spit venom like a serpant
And I'll make you my servant
Clean my crib on the surface
Lemme wrap this up like a turban

Ok, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous
I say I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin, and slurpin my syrupin
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain
I see you turning up with your turn up ain't workin
