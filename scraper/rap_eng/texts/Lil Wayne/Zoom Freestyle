[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Weezy bad, nah really I'm good
Sound like a T-Rex live under my hood
And you better know the Tec live under my seat
Put you in the ground, now you live under my feet
All white diamonds on the front of my teeth
And you better put the O in front of my G
The bullshit they talking doesn't come to my knee
I'm like a linebacker, don't run it by me
My two best friends will accompany me
And right now they are in my dungarees 'sleep
One named Mack, one named Nina
They hit you, make you do the Macarena, where your tool?
You gon' need it like a muhfucker
And I am so New Orleans like a muhfucker
Its Young Money and we eating, get your own supper
Make me go off in the trunk, get that bone crusher

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Tec's, AK's, I leave the scene ugly
Chest, head, face, arms, legs, stomach
I never been afraid, I ain't scared of nothin'
Cause I got my thing, my thing, my thing
And that bitch go boom, boom boom
Boom, boom, boom
You hear them girls like ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
They like the way I ball, they call me hot sauce
They know I keep that toaster, you can be my Pop-Tart
I never had height, but boy I got heart
And I ain't gotta speak, I just let my car talk
I got more clips than any movie you saw
I pull up on you like I need some Grey Poupon
Hard hat? No, but I got the tool on
And you should be my paper if ever the tool is drawn
Flow retarded, when I spit, I get my drool on
I don't rap, I just shit like a newborn
I don't write, I just spit like a tooth gone
So tell them haters cut it out like a coupon
How come that chopper sound like a nuke bomb?
Little nigga gotta hold that bitch with two arms
I got the heat, the fire, and the lukewarm
I'm on your heels like a shoe horn

[Hook]
