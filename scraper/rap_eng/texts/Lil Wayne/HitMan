Lord, I think I need a hitman
Tell Biggie I'm a big fan
Ooh my pockets on biggie smalls, and your pockets on stickman
I just came from the gun store, I swear I spent about 10 grand
I have your family wearing black clothes
And your homies wearing shit bags
Lord, I think I need a hitman
We bout to go kidnap a rich man
If he don’t give it up we chop him up
And send his body parts to his house gift-wrapped
Lord, I think I need a hit man, to put a hit out on the big man
As you can see I've got big plans, big plans to be the big man
Lord I think I need a hit man, cause I can't trust the next man
Lord I thank you for my weed man
But right now we playing phone tag
I’m doing 40 down the boulevard (Ayy)
With my homie that's gon' take the charge (Ayy)
He got the Tommie and I got the Mac
And on your head they've got a contract
Lord I thank you for my hit man, and tell Pac I'm a big fan
I sing Dear Mama to my dear mama
And sing Hit 'Em Up to my Daddy bitch ass (Ooh)
Police pull up, swallow the evidence (Hey)
Then walk off like George Jefferson (Hey)
Its Tunechi baby, I'm a scumbag
And I'm priceless plus Tax (Ooh)
Lord I thank you for these bricks man (Ooh)
I got ’em scratching thats a skin rash (Hey)
Don’t get high off your own supply (Chh)
But I gotta try before I buy (Woo)
I buss back and put that bitch in drive (Oo)
Then circle back and make sure them Nigga's die (Ooh)
I’m hot and spicy with this Choppa nigga
I put it to your ear and BAP, eavesdrop a Nigga
Lord I think I need a hit man, Tell Pimp C I'm a big fan
Pockets on Vin Diesel, pockets on Riff Raff
Niggas faker than witch-craft, I split a Nigga in half
These lil boys they look up to me, I put the G on Giraffe
Lord I thank you for my hit man, but we need to hit a lick man
Cause my girl want some implants
Lord I think the bitch a Kim fan
Doing 40 down the boulevard

She said its nothing boy I got your back
Because these other Niggas copycats
Lord I think I need a hit man, this for all my fans that been fans
I'm so sorry, I'm so fucking sorry
I’m so sorry for the wait like slim-fast

Shoot the car, brains splash on the tint tag
