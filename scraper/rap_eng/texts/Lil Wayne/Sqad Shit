[Verse 1: Peanut Flame]
Bitch im sqad fa life
Hit cha one time and if you dont die
Bitches scarred fa life

Better grip ya torch is tight
When we park and cut off tha lights
Will hold tha fight
Believe these lil dawgs a bite

When im on or off the mic
In the rawest night
You could afford tha price
Call us soft or dark or light
Jus becuz my voice is light
The bottom of my arms is bright
Tha chrome is right here
Stand right here on tha site
Yount wanna be in that place
Witcha mom with a sad face
While they go and put ur ashes in that vase
Gimme room gimme git back space
Fore i fix it where yo jaw can't git back strait
And tha streets is too raw
It can't git back safe
If a josh should kiddy on tha strength of tha weight
Look im not a white boy
Not a new kid on tha block
Want tha white boy halla

Fuckin pigs on my ass - so they taxin me

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Yea ima hustler baby

And i love me some ki's
Quarters ounces and o's
Na while this bouta bubble
So put it in there fast
Ta take all this crack
And go flood tha ave
Cut it back crums ta grams
From hand ta hand
Dubs ta grands
From the slums ta them industry club jams
I keep it jumpin
Supa my front man
Becuz i gatta do this rap shit jus fa a fronting
And if i ever see tha day my muzik bu-bumb
Back ta tha block ta pump sand
Know how ta live call me young man
And shit i did it fa my daddy
And understand if you lookn fa pitcture round that nigga in tha alley
Whaaat niggas still got it all tha time - just find me
True hustlers never stops ta grind - im grindin
When the drought come around some prices go up
My numbers come down
Nigga got hovers - got pounds - got bundles
Slick with the hustle
Weezy leave you with tha itch
And the uptown shuffle
Gimme a plate
Come through with that shit that they had back in 88
Balloons of heroine
Silver packs are 88
Crazy wait paper straight
Lazy eye mercedes 5
Slow and drive
We dont need tha cop ta pull us over got that blow in inside
Man tha bitch ain't got no in size
Cuz it stop with tha yay from tha flo up
Come tell weezy wee you need that yola
