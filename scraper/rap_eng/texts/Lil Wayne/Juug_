[Verse]
I juug in the back of the hummer
I juug at the back of the complex
I work that wrist like a Timex
I do it big, nigga five-ex
I do not give out no freebie
I don't play, let's make a deal
I'm taxin' if you're fake nigga
I'm taxin' if you trill
Work, work, work
I got that work
Purp slurping, I got them percs
All of these medicine bottles
Ballin' like Cedric Ceballos
