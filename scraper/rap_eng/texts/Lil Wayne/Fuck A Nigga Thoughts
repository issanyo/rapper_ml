[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ok, money on my mind, fuck a nigga thoughts
He ain't even thank, he ain't even seen me with tha pistol and tha shank
Walked up to him with put tha pistol to his tank, pussy nigga faint
Pick that pussy up naw let him lay
Where im from I see a fuckin dead body every day(x4)
Hammer in them draws hammer in them draws
And yall ain't nothing but nails in a wall
Bolsters, Holsters, empty like a motha fucka
Off my hip clip empty like a motha fucka
Ha-ha ok, simply im a burglar but its fly carter inducted to fly squader
Ok simply im a motha fucka pimpin ain't dead because im pimpin like a motha fucka
Now where ya ho at wipe ya feet on tha door mat ima bring the N-O back like a nigga with no back
Ima go forward
The top gon get lowered
Them hoes gon get cut like a sword I kno it
Ye ain't gotta tell me I already smell it
Ya pussy niggas eatin peanut butter and jealous
You’re Los like Angeles
But you can find me in a white tan Ellis
Juss like Van Halen ima rock out bitch

And I hope your ass choke when you suck on my dick. Weezy

[Verse 3: Lil’ Wayne]

Uptown back in it, Hollygrove black menace, black shirt, black tennis, black semi
