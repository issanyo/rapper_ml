[Hook: Babyface]
I'm not saying this to shake you up (saying)
I'm just saying this to wake you up (saying)
It's all good when we're making love
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, cause granted, my love for you is real
And if you don't love me, somebody else will
Baby girl don't you, ever, get too, comfortable
(Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to the left, to the left
If you wanna leave, be my guest, you can step
Feeling irreplaceable, listening to Beyoncé
Well, okay, I put you out on your B'day
Hey, now you be rocking with Weezy
Bedroom in the bank, baby we safe
I got game like EA
But I wanna let you play
And don't I treat you like soufflé?
Don't I look at you like I see a new day?
And don't I do what I do say?
I'm through talking so I'ma let you 'Face
And let 'Ye do 'Ye

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, let me catch my breath
Talking 'bout leaving and you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct
And I'mma send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave, you leaving the best
So you will have to settle for less
And I am no Elliott Ness
I don't handcuff, I don't arrest
I do confess to the murder scene
Cause under them sheets, I am a mess
Yes, baby you're blessed
Now just don't jump your nest, come on

Baby girl don't you, ever, get too, comfortable

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, it's no sweat, no sweat
I would never 1-2-3-4-get
About you, your love, your sex
You know I work you out like Bowflex
Ha-ha, I jokes no stress
Love, live life, proceed, progress
Make sure the neighbors get no rest
We can get together never disconnect
Yeah, your back, your neck
Funny how that song hasn't got old yet
To us, so let's project
You stay in, never incorrect
'Face!
