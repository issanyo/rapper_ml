[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I gotta bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser
But shawty from Cuba still workin' on a Visa
Her girlfriend Lisa met her in Puerto Rico
How she don't suck dick but expectin' me to eat her?
I gotta bitch named Keisha she a real dick pleaser
I gotta bitch named Keisha she a real dick pleaser

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got a bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser
But shawty from Cuba, still workin' on her visa
Her girlfriend Lisa, met her in Puerto Rico
How she don't suck dick, but expectin' me to eat her?
That ho crazy, man, you don't wanna meet her
But her homegirl Nita swallow cum by the liter
She look good in boy shorts and a beater
But this other girl Quita way sexier than Nita
I ain't lyin she the, hottest bitch, heater
But I'm a fuckin' freezer, yea, I'mma fuckin' leave her
Yeah, I'm a fuckin' eagle, flyer and deeper
Smoke like a Cohiba, your ho give me cerebral
Now get low and touch your toes for my people
And if you ain't fuckin' them, then you ain't fuckin' me either
You think your man hot? Well, fuck it, me ether
Heard I got guap, wanna kick it like FIFA
Every day Christmas, cause I'm smokin' that wreath-a (reefer)
Keep a lot of bitches like Queen Latifah
I am southern-land, not Kiefer
Y-M-E for Young Money Entertainment, ha
Run, dummy, finna bang it
You want beef? Then my money will arrange it
I am not fuckin' finna aim it
But that Nina Ross shout for me when I'm angry
Yeah, Hollygrove, biatch
Sloppy like Joe, you better go get G.I
All my guns knee high, M-O-N-E-Y
Thats what I rely on, I'm gone
He high, yep, I'm three-high
Im just schoolin' these fucks like DeVry
College institution, finals and confusion
Stop with your excuses, hip-hop, I am seducin'
Beat ya like producers, eat you like produce
Man I'll fuck your girl till her pussy got no juice
Now she can't produce, so you won't be needin' that baby
Cause all you really need is Weezy F. Baby

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
Alright let me vent for a minute
See, the problem I got with the game is
There are no gatekeepers in hip hop
Who is letting these wack niggas in?
I mean, can someone please put a combination lock on the door
And stop giving out the code?
God damn! Hey, Millz, show 'em how it's done

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
I knew this freak named Tammy from around the way
She used to go to Catholic school back in the day
Now she strippin' in Sue's for a stack a day
But she bring it all to Daddy, so that's okay
I got bitch named Lola, true dick-smoker
Part-time broker late nights, she work at Strokers
Her cousin named Mocha, got a insane spine
But it's crazy 'cause I fucked 'em both at the same time
I even got a bitch in the bay named Jessica
I swear, she might give the best mouth in America
Vanessa got a attitude, but her ass meaner
She remind me of this ho I used to fuck named Sabrina
Ugly little thing, from the home of the Ravens
I only kept around 'cause her ass was amazing
Tiffany and Emily, my bonafide sluts
When I cum, they touch tongues and share that nut
Got a white chick down in Florida named Sasha
On my momma, her head golden like an Oscar
And I met her through Tasha
At the condo she let me fuck her on the washer
September nigga, so you know he nasty
And if she nasty, we do the nasty
Now, I tell a bitch like this
You gotta take 10 dicks before you meet the president
Young Money!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I know this one honey
I call her track star, cause when we fuck she run from me
And I'm hella fly, and her dude dumb-bummy
And I don't get girls, I make her get one for me
My weed real plummy, and real gummy
And my flow is harder than an anvil, honey
Shoot these niggas with the handheld, honey
I paper chase, fuck standstill money
Niggas kill with me and kill for me
Best believe we ridin' if the fan belt runnin'
Leave a mothafucker just layin' there bloody
I'm from the dirty and I make it rain, damn, that's muddy
She just wanna be my cuddy buddy
And on these tracks I go nutty-butty
What it dizzoo, is you or is you ain't my baby?
Baby?
