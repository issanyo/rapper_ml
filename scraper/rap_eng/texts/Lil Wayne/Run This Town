[Intro]
Yeah
Millzy, I see you
T told me do this shit
So I'mma do this shit
No Ceilings!
Yeah, hahah
I'mma run this town tonight
Alright now

[Verse]
Nigga, we are so ready for the war
C-A-R-T-E-R, put the beat in ER
I'm colder than B-R, add another three Rs
Watch me like DVD/VCR
Pump to your chest, I ain't talking CPR
Riding this track like a motherfucking street car
New Orleans coroner, his name is Frank Minyard
Fuck with me wrong, you’ll be waking up in his yard
Man, I go crazy on the beat, I go Nimrod
Man, I act a ass, treat the beat like a hemorrhoid
Man, I go to work on the beat, call it employed
Man, I kicks it, bitch, get your shin guard
Young Money run this, towns, countries
I still eat rappers; mmm, scrumptious
My goons tote thumpers, they pump 'em like krumpers
Anybody beat, I'm gon' go Archie bonkers
Tunechi be the wildest, let's run the metropolis
I pop like lollies, you drop like eyelids
The money keep calling, I hear the shit dialing
And they say money talks, you can hear my shit hollering
You softer than ny-lin; oops, I meant nylon
Perfection is the goal and I’m headed to the pylon
Crown fit me good, I ain’t even got to try on
The pistol mean business, that bitch should have a tie on
T done told me do this shit, so I had to do this shit
I get superhero money, call a nigga "super rich"
Keep it "super" for a while, let me get on my "super" shit
Super ill, super sick, dog, I go super Vick
Ran into a super-woman, turned  her to a super bitch
Hit her with that super dick, she be coming super quick
Super Millz, Mack, Tyga, Streets, Neli, Super Nick
Super Drizzy, Gudda, Chuckee, Twist, that's the super-clique
Now I’m off that "super" shit, fuck that shit, I super quit
Running circles 'round the game like a hula hoop and shit
You're gonna have to loop this shit, there won’t be a duplicate
And my blunts be super thick, I'm higher than a Supra kick
I’m the bomb, baby, watch me nuke this shit
When I leave the booth, they gotta scoop this shit
My apologies, diabolically
I’m the prodigy, do you roger me?
I look in the flames and see a hotter me
But how come I’m still colder than commonly
Yeah we run this town, like a lot of feet
Young Mula, baby; I'm proud of me
