Going going im gone
More green than the white house lawn
I'm looking like king with your queen boy you just my pawn
House on 44 acres tryna fuck with me thats danger boy
Ride around town with so much paper neighbors think I'm the paperboy
I got racks on racks on stacks on stacks and racks and stacks on that
Racks on jet always on the next
Stacks on deck like they batting next
Yo girl take one look my way
And watch that pussy dilate
If u on road to riches get the fuck up off my driveway
Im the freshest man out there and you lookin like you expired
You can catch me at the party taking shots like a sniper
Sniping bitches you dont got a shot with
Got her pants off got her topless
Got her head down like an ostrich
Knock her lights out, power outage
Sippin cliquot in a tall glass
She 100 pounds but its all ass
Shoot for the stars that suicide
Try cross me get crucified
Runnin shit like a marathon
Stuntin til I die, ryan dunn
Derail every track, haters keep trippin they dont even unpack
I fill that pussy past capacity
Spit straight shots you spit daqaris
Im living all your fantasies
I eat your girl you eat at applebees
King james call me your magesty
Raps a war this tracks a casualty
I act as if the tracks my kid and kill it casey anthony
