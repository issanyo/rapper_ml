Can't no nigga do it quite like me
Rock ice like Phi
Cop a J keep the price in the winter like Weezy
Ain't no nigga like me
This be, this be
Ain't no nigga do it quite like me
Can't no nigga do it quite like me
Rock ice like Phi
Cop a J keep the price in the winter like Weezy
Ain't no nigga like me
This be

[Verse 1]
Now who you know can cop a J
Keep the price in the winter like me
Rock ice like me
Talk a monkey out a banana tree
I'm a P.I.M.P
Tip when I walk, slur when I talk
Bitch, catch the ? quick
If she runnin' her lip
If a nigga trip, I give him a clip
Now that's some gangsta shit
Nigga bitch believe, which is not just for me
Just for you
Instead of bringing one key
The bitch can bring two
I'm a bad mother ooh
Just doin' what I do
So smooth, I'm a hustler baby
I just want you to know
Anywhere I've been
Or where I'm about to go


[Chorus]
