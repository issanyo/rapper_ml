So this a story. I had a broad and umm, you know Mane called me to the room. He got something so fine she got on a Apple bottom shirt, I don't even know what her pants was. She jumped on stage and served me on stage on "I'm way more fly than you". Yea so you know, Mack Mane call me on some Hollygrove shit, he was like come down holla at ya boy. So I come down, he got her in the bed with just pumps on, the Apple bottom shirt and drawers on. Mind you she's a stallion, she gotta weigh like 250 pounds, all fine-ness. So look she laying in the bed just playing, looking. I come in the room, how I come in the room Mack? I don't wana lie to these bitches, how I come in?
