She love the Chevy tho now she in the Lambo, I want her but she be on the corner, that lambo it wasn't a loner, but her mom is the owner, I heard she's an organ donner, she don't even drink pinnacle, but she's sharp like a sickle, people rate her as a nickle, she come be wit me she's ...laughing like she got a tickle, if u throw tht pussy at me it really doesn't matter, but I'mma hit it, girl I'm the batter I want to show u off in public so they know that I got it but if they keep hatin like MJ I'mma tell them to beat it
