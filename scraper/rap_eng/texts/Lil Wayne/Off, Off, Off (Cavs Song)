[Intro]
Light the torch
It's lit, we lit
Ain't that what the young kids say these days?
(Lebron)

[Verse]
The Kia got State Farm insurance
That three point from J.R's the purest
We got that play hard endurance
We here to stay, y'all the tourists
The king on his throne, now it's on
Kyrie just destroying the zone
The isolation, double team
He driving and dish it, all his dishes be clean
Tatted up like J.R Smith
What was that sound? That was swish
Shoutout to Shumpert and Trist
They got the rebounds and defense
Stop all that crying about Delly  game
You know Lebron want hella rings
You know lil Kev got hella range
I've been down with T. Lue since he was wearing braids
Here comes the fast break, just get out the man's way
It's lead by Lebron and he's sunk like an earthquake
As soon as he dunking we all feel the world shake
Like arrivederci, all hail the king
The city on his shoulder like barbell on strings
But ain't no place like home
That rope ain't too long and they gon' pull it off
The king want his crown back, he never took it off
Tunechi

[Outro]
I know I'm being cavalier
Yeah, I know I'm being cavalier
But you know what you could do?
Pass me that freaking ball
Watch me go off, off, off
Watch me go off, off, off
Pass me the ball, watch me go off
Pass me the ball, watch me go off
Pass me the ball, watch me go off
Watch me go off, pass me the, off, off, off
Now can you dab for the Cav?
The left, dab for the Cav
To the right dab for the Cav
Watch me go off
Watch me go off, off, off
(Lebron James)
Pass me the freaking ball
Watch me go off, off, off
Watch me go off
Watch me go off
Mula babe
(Lebron James)
Pass me the ball, watch me go off
Pass me the ball, watch me go off
Pass me the ball, watch me go off
Watch me go off, watch me go off, off, off
Now can you dab for the Cav?
How many of you dab for the Cav?
Turn up that dab for the Cav (to the left)
To the right, dab for the Cav
Pass me the ball, watch me go off, off, off
Pass me the ball, watch me go off
Watch me go off, watch me go off, off, off
Mula baby
Shoutout my little brother J.R, yeah
Channing Frye, shoutout Mo Will

Remind me to tell you

Ben B's on the beat
