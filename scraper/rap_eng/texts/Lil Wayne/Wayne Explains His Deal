Preferable, the Roc, Def Jam, Jay-Z, Shawn Carter. Jiggaman No, why? Cause I was, yahearinme? But I was still on the [?], yahearinme? With [?] on it, yahearinme? But I said, Imma just, ride it out, yahearinme? And see what - and see what I can do, yahearinme? And so then I figured "Know, Imma go with the Roc. Imma go by Jay". And Jay was tryna help me. He was really trying, he was like "Dude whenever you get out your situation, I'm here, I'm here. Whatever you need, I'm here". It's like believe that. Then all the sudden I gets a call from Universal and they like "Hey". They wasn't talking no - I couldn't even understand what they're talking about. They were talking about, millions and stuff. Those were I ain't ever heard of, yahearinme? So I was like "Dayyyuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum" and I was like "Believe that" and so, yahearinme? In reality of it all, I got - I got some more time over here. I ain't finished doing what I was doing. So, what Weezy's doing? Finishing up. You motherfuckers still stay - stay in focus
