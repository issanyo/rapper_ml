[Intro: D.A. Doman]
D.A. got that dope

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I'm a nasty nigga, and you so nasty, girl
You so, you so, you so, you so, you so nasty, girl
I’m a nasty nigga, and you so nasty, girl
You so, you so, you so, you so, you so nasty, girl

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Some say the ex make the sex best
Take that dick right down in her chest
Friend look like she down to get next
1942 make her undress
Flex and move it left, right
You get a best hit, I live my best life
You got a day job until the bedtime
I hit it all night, wake up to egg whites (Ooh)
Nigga fell into that pussy like a trap
Word to 50, tell them bitches, "Get the strap" (Okay)
I never talk when I get behind the back (No)
I do like Nipsey and I give that hoe a slap (Ahh)

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I'm a nasty nigga, and you so nasty, girl
You so, you so, you so, you so, you so nasty, girl
I'm a nasty nigga, and you so nasty, girl
You so, you so, you so, you so, you so nasty, girl

[Post-Chorus: Saweetie]
You a nasty nigga, you a nasty nigga
You a nasty nigga, I love that nasty nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I’m a nasty fuck, I like a plastic slut
They're always glad to fuck, I'm always last to nut
I let her ride my face just like a passenger
I let her drink my kids, come lick these bastards up
Better hit my drink, let her pop two illies
Tell her say my name, she say, "You got too many"
I like to pull her hair, she like to pull mine, too
I hit it raw, so when you suck, it taste just like you
Hold up, I can slip and slide, or I can dive in it
We can 69, or we can 96
She started from beside, bitch to her bottom bitch
I'm a nasty guy, gynecologist

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I'm a nasty nigga, and you so nasty, girl
You so, you so, you so, you so, you so nasty, girl
I'm a nasty nigga, and you so nasty, girl
You so, you so, you so, you so, you so nasty, girl

[Post-Chorus: Saweetie]
You a nasty nigga, you a nasty nigga
You a nasty nigga, I love that nasty nigga

[Verse 3: Saweetie]
I got 69 problems and cumming is not one (Yeah)
And my nigga fucked up so I'm 'bout to get some (Uh huh)
I just hit my boy toy and he comin’ around one (Where he at?)
I gave him that dumb tongue and clearly he’s still sprung, hmm
Ooh shit, it's ’bout to pop off
Put my hand on his dick and, girl, it was not soft (Uh huh)
Titties so big, he got lost in the ta-ta's
Lick his way down South, good thing I waxed my cha-cha
Venus fly trap when I make that ass clap (Yeah)
If you give me good dick, you ain't getting that back (Ooh)
Pull the microphone back, Jill Scott with the sack (Yass)
Pussy water hot class, and he want another glass

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I'm a nasty nigga, and you so nasty, girl
You so, you so, you so, you so, you so nasty, girl
I’m a nasty nigga, and you so nasty, girl
You so, you so, you so, you so, you so nasty, girl
I'm a nasty nigga

[Outro: Saweetie]
You
You
