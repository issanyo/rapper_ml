[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1 : Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane LaFlare, millionaire but don’t give no care
Tote my pistol anywhere, go to war with a grizzly bear
Burn yo' house with yo' kids in there
Called the folks I had Mid in there
A-K & my Sig in there, drop top V12 cylinder
Your girl never had Christian Louboutins so I bought her a pair
Really it’s not an affair cause she fucked a millionaire
Mack-10, with a coolant fool
These fuck niggas with bullet wounds
Extensions hanging out my britches
You can see this from a distance
I got Bloods and Crips with 30 clips
Fresh ass nigga with a dirty pistol
I’m the same nigga that fucked yo' sister
You so broke, can’t buy no pistol
I’ll buy yo' bitch, I’ll buy yo' life
Don’t no one but yo mama miss ya
Every day I’m on drive nigga, never catch me in neutral
I ain’t doin' nothing in reverse
I wear Louie shoes, nigga, not Converse
This concert is my convert
Got the right plan but the wrong person
I got yellow gold, I got rose gold
I got pink diamonds like Starburst
I don’t rehearse, I don’t plan first
I need a strong hook, I call the right person

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Yella bone, butt naked
If the pussy wack eject it
Man all my hoes be actin' like detectives
But I don’t give a fuck & if I did I would give it to you
That rainbow has two colors, rhythm & blues, yeah
I just sold Father Time a time zone
Say we runnin' out of time
Tell that to a time bomb yeah
Then she kiss me on my bullet wound
Who are you, cause motherfucker I’m me, fuckin' right
And if she say she catching that nut, I throw a strike
I can’t believe this butter, go get my butter knife
Shoot a nigga twice in case he live a double life
Lil Tunechi yeah

[Verse 2 : Young Scooter]
Shawty pussy wet, the dope dripping wet
I live a double life, I got a stupid dumb check
I do the shit that rappers do without a rap check
I shit on hoes & pour up foes, I got street respect
I hit you with that carbon, you won’t live a double life
I hit two niggas last week so I got double stripes
Foreign bad bitch & she fuckin' on sight
I go Hublos, I got Rollies, I got ice on top of ice

[Hook]
Yella bone, butt naked
If the pussy wack eject it
