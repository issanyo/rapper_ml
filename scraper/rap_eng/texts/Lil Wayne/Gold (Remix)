[Intro: Kiiara]
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Roof was on, let me, love me

[Verse 1: Kiiara]
Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
Don't care what you say to me, I'ma bite your feelings out (Gold up in my teeth)
I missed you in the basement
(Gold up in my teeth)
But your brother was a good substitute for you

[Pre-Chorus: Kiiara]
And if you love me, love me, but you never let me go
When the roof was on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry, honey, but you never really show
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know

[Chorus: Kiiara]
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Without ever letting you know

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Zillion dollar smile
Smellin' kinda loud, eyes are like Chinatown
I'm a muddy cup savage, moneybag addict
Such a pill popper, did you know they had daddies?
Caught up in my magic, caught up in my karats
We could make love like rabbits, hol' up
All white gold mouth, dog, roof, roof
On fire, watch the whole house fall, hol' up
Tunechi on the remix, me and Kiiara, she lit
That "Caught up in my teeth" shit, that Tunechi and Kii Kii shit
If yellow was gold, we'd follow the yellow brick road
I'm lettin' 'em go without ever lettin' you know

[Chorus: Kiiara]
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know (Mula)
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Without ever letting you know

[Verse 3: Kiiara]
Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
Taste like money when I speak
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
And I missed you in the basement
(Yeah, gold up in my teeth)
Bodies on the pavement (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Kiiara]
And if you love me, love me, but you never let me go
When the roof was on fire, you never let me know
Say youâ€™re sorry honey, but you never really show
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know

[Chorus: Kiiara]
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me-on-ly s-you know
Without ever letting you know
