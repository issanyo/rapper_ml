[Intro: Chris Brown]
I don’t see how you can hate from outside of the club
You can’t even get in
Hahaha l'ego!

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah
That shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in 10 years, in two days
Ladies love me; I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I’m getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
Cause I’m killing every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said on my dick
I ain’t really mean to say on my dick
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I’m done

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo Breezy, let me show you how to keep the dice rolling when you're doing that thing over there, homie
Let's go!
Cause I'm feeling like I’m running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
Cause you know I gotta win everyday, day
See they really really wanna pop me
Just know that you will never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Everytime I come a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing that nigga think that he be doing
Cause it doesn't matter cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing
I gotta do a lot of things that make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and in again
And I be doing it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be banging on my chest
And I bang in the east and I'm bangin' in the west
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go)
See the way we on and we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin' in
And we always gotta do it and take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y’all doin’?
I’m Lil Tunechi, I’m a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don’t eat sushi, I’m the shit, no, I’m pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dressed like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain’t eatin’, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot ‘em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then I’m like olé
I don’t care what you say, so don’t even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That’s word to my flag, and my flag red
I’m out of my head, bitch I’m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain’t hotter than mine, nope, not on my time and I’m not even trying
Whats poppin’ slime? Nothin’ five, and if they trippin’ fuck ‘em five
I ain’t got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas, as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight, bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddy’s dead
You faggots scared cause I’m too wild, been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
I’m so Young Money, if you got eyes look at me now, bitch

[Hook]

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Okay, okay
Is that right?
I’m fresher than a motherfucker
