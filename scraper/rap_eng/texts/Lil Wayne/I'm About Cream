[Hook x2]
I’m about cream, I’ma, I’ma ’bout cream (about that)
I’m about cream, I’ma, I’ma ’bout cream
About that money and about that cream (hey, hey, hey)
I’m about cream, I’ma, I’ma ’bout cream

[Verse 1: Maino]
I’m about cream, homie I’m about cash
I’m about dollar signs, where that brown bag?
I’m a big boy, 3 stacks, Outkast
For that bread I be in your house like
I go deaf ears if it ain't about no dough
Porsche mind state this my Panamera flow
Offshore Royal oak, I got diamonds in ‘em
Gucci jean suit, keep a couple thousand in ‘em
Came up hard, handle food in the refrigerator
Now these haters can’t breath need a respirator
Women beep me every time they see me
Sippin’ DP on my way to DC
Ask niggas out in Florida they know me well
Pretty bitches say I’m crazy out in ACL
Fuck the bullshit baby I’m about mine
Champagne in the air, it’s about time

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Just left my PO and everything kosher
Bitch I’m gettin' money like the end gettin' closer
Money on my mind, pussy on my radar
Bitch I’m gettin' paid, I’m on my Bernie Madoff
Money talks, bullshit walks, cut the legs off
Aim at your egg, turn that shit to eggnog
And if I fall, my money is my cushion
Niggas can’t see me like they not lookin'
To the red flag, I pledge of allegiance
Y’all bitches don’t want beef like vegans
I don’t have a care and if I do I take care of it
Haters dead waitin', I ain’t with that Pall-bearer shit
Never played lotto, I don’t believe in luck
They tried to send me sugar, wasn’t sweet enough
Maino what's poppin? hustle hard nigga
This that money train, all aboard nigga

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3: Maino]
I’m about cream, homie I’m about bread
I’m about bad bitches that’s about head
I’m about to ride by hangin' out the Benz
We gettin' money like we never heard about of the feds
The black Bentley Coupe rollin’ like the Bat-mobile
I feel 8 feet tall, man I’m Shaq O'neal
I’m about guap baby, I’m about cake
I push a button and the doors to about face
Whats poppin' mami, I be gettin’ money now
I’m from Brooklyn, but they love me out in Houston now
Sayin' “hi” to life, bye to my broke days
I’m about a dollar, everyday all day

[Hook]
