[Hook]
Oh my what a night I'm a wake up in the morning like oh, oh [x2]
She super fine she looking at me
With them light brown we in the back seat
Shawty body shaped like a figure eight
Yeah that pussy great
She bout to get ate

[Verse 1]
It was a Friday
I was on the highway
Riding to that Kanye
That's when I saw a bad bitch ridin right behind me
And I slowed down so she can be beside me
Like beep beep Shawty you sweet shawty Best pullover in me shawty
Gas station that's on me
And you know that ain't cheap shawty
You deserve 93 shawty
You deserve me shawty
So tell that other nigga
He can leave like a tree falling
And when it comes to love Baby I'm free falling
Did I leave my eyes In yo pussy cause I see me all in, it
And I put her to bed
And know she sleep walking
And she never answer her phone
Not even if E.T. calling
Man you should see darlin
She like a sea dolphin
Splash splash shout out bird gang
She balling
And I just try to be her
Tol ya somethin
Cop' her 20 hand bags
Out of coach or something
First class flight
Get her out of coach o something
How bout vacation
Round my by bon voyage
And With no snowtra something
Yeah
And tell yo man he don't
Owe me nothing
Tell him open his eyes I gotta show him something
Uh
I started riding
Like a dirty dozen
Uh
Have a feeling like she Oprah cousin haha
But fuck money
I give her mostly loving
Then I'm gone before it's sunny

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's next Friday
I'm on the high way
Ridin to that Sade`
I se a bad bitch up in a Hyundai
I said "baby you supposed to be up in my place"
She started laughin
I got the joke late
Look I just want ta tie u down with this rope braid
Lil mama so cold
I call her Snowflake
I fuck her so good on that coldplay
Now what you kno bout it
What you know about it
It ain't what you know about it's how you go about it
An I go about it like I kno about it
Like I'm sho about it
Like I'm so about it
Baby I can take you
Farther than your fantasy
Maybe one day I can be the father of your family
I can handle all the extremities
She remember me ohww

[Hook]

Oh oh oh oh

Aye!
