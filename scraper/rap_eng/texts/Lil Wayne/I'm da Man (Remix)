And you know I keep work

I'm the man, bitch, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I talk big chips, ride big whips
Smelling like kush, walking through Sax Fifth
It's Rick Ross, my nigga Shawty Lo
All the bricks bought, we bought a lot of dough
They know it's me, they know it's me
I'm the man who touched the man for them forty keys
I'm the man sold them forty, went and bought a hundred piece
In the club, D4L and Triple C's, a hundred deep
You wanna beef, they wanna beef
Don't you know niggas die every day? That's where I'm coming from
Don't you know niggas stay in line when they see that Tommy gun?
That's a hundred, son, 'round a hundred, son
You wanna eat, they wanna eat
Ain't nothing free, my nigga, you gotta run the fucking streets
At least a week, see what you could move
You gotta move your feet if you want to fill these shoes
Ross

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Shawty Lo]
Look, old money, new work
Little coke in my gums like my tooth hurt
They from the red clay, I'm from that brown dirt
I love my baby mama and granddaddy Purt
New shirt, new jeans
New Bent, cost a nigga two Beems
That's two hundred thousand, nigga, you don't know nothing 'bout it
