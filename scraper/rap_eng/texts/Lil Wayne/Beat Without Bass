Welcome to dipset baby

[Lil' Wayne]
Okay, my leather so soft but don't think I ain't hard
Bitch say Weezy make it rain, I say bitch I ain't God
But I am God's son, but you know I ain't Nas
See, he got a positive aim, and I aim nines
Man, little Weezy got a style that even I can't find
Man, some shit just be so hard, I be like that line ain't mine
And if that is under a gram, then that line ain't mine
And if you niggas talking war, well bitch, it's combat time
Hey, I take three l's to the head: Love, Live, Life, and I'm dead
Young Money, Dipset, that's what this is
And if I ain't good looking, you can bet my bitch is
I done made it off Apple Street like it was 2300 Jackson Street
Young Money, can't join 'em nor beat 'em
Where the fuck is Robin Leach when you need him?
A rich nigga can't even buy freedom
That's why I give my white bitches everything but freedom
I do my white bitches anything but beat 'em
And if they like rat poison, then I'mma feed 'em
I'm sophisticated, fresh from Antarctica my wrist just made it
I'm rich bitch, I ain't broke no more
But I will still chop you up and feed your ass to the poor
I'm 'bout my cream like a s'more
You old ass rappers better stay on tour
You're like 44, I got a 44, I'm 24
I could murk you and come home when I'm 44

What's a beat without bass

Dudes love me say I got a hell of a swag
See me hoppin out them coups benz bentleys and jags
With balenciaga bags in some lil skimpy shit

And she rock her real hair run yo fingers through this shit
I am somethin like the shit and yo nigga I will pimp
U ain't got my money honey hit em with a hollow tip
See Freekey is crazy insane and hazy
And that?s my big brotha so do not try to play me

The zone is where I?m gettin when Im geeked up homie
