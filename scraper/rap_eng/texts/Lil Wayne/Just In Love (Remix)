[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Young Mula baby
I’m just in love with you baby

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
I love a girl in a whole another language
People look at us strange
Don't understand us, they try to change it
I try to tell her don't change

[Bridge 1: Joe Jonas]
Talk love and they say it sounds crazy
Love's even more wild when you're angry
Don't understand why you wanna change it
(Girl, listen to me)

[Bridge 2: Joe Jonas]
You're just running from the truth
But I’m scared of losing you
You are worth too much to lose
Baby, if you’re still confused

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & (Lil Wayne)]
Girl, I’m just in love with you
Girl, I’m just in love with you
No other words to use
I’m just in love with you (aye Joe, I got you, Gucci, yeahh)
I’m just in love with you (Young Tunechi baby, yeah)
Ohh yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Okay, ain’t no love like the one I got
I’m a prisoner of love, got my heart on lock
It’s like a star from the sky fell by my side
And she tell me that it’s mine, and I say "that’s fine"
And she look like a butterfly, smell like a flower
Man, we go together like money and the power
And I don’t need nothin', nothin' but her
Cause all them other bitches ain’t fuckin' with her
And the smile on her face make the world a better place
But she out of this world, so we somewhere out in space
Makin' love like animals, Planet Of The Apes
All night, all mornin', too bright, pull the drapes
Man, we just doin' what we does
The tank on E, yeah, just e-nough
And we just be, yeah, just because
Don’t worry ’bout me, I’m just in love (I’m just in love)
(JOE!)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Girl, I’m just in love
I’m just in love with you
(Did you hear what I said?)
Girl, I’m just in love with you
(Can’t nobody change it?)
No other words to use
I love you baby
I’m just in love with you
I’m just in love with you
I’m just in love with you
I’m just in love
I’m just in love with you

[Verse 3: Joe Jonas]
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Never knew what we have
They don’t understand
Words are just a waste of time
We know this is real, and I know how you feel
When you put your hand in mine

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & (Lil Wayne)]
Girl, I’m just in love with you (yeah, haha)
Girl, I’m just in love with you (YMCMB)
No other words to use (wooo)
I’m just in love with you
Let me say it again, let me say it again
I’m just in love with you (Young JJ)
I’m just in love with you (that’s how we do it)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I’m just in love with you, baby
I mean ever since you came in to my life, my life has changed
For the better
