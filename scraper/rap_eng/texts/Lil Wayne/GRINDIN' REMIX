[TRIBE MAFIA TAG: TRIBE MAFIA]

[Verse 1: Chinasty] Workin' like I gotta' pay ten bills in one day

Nigga, Im' grindin'

All these diamonds on my neck, looking like a flashlight

Nigga im' shine'n

Tribe Mafia, they thought we was done, but we back call that shit perfect time'n

Don't hate. Please get the fuck out my face!

We don't respond to that shit when its fake

Your squad against my squad nigga that's a death date

So soft you try not to be

Your opinions don't really matter me

There's no fucking feelings involve

Nope, not no feelings involve

Oh you just mad cause she's missing your calls?

But she can't talk with my dick in her jaws

Pull that ass back, make her clap an applause

Surfboard this dick,call that shit a sea saw

Yes

She chasing me, cause' she's chasing the best

She don't want you, cause' you just like the rest

Basic. Predictable. Stress

Plus she likes them niggas from the west

Making money every day. while your ass is waiting on a check

Nigga i'm Grindin'!

[Lil Wayne: Chorus]

Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Put time into all this shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I think I got it bitch
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

[DASHAWN DANIELS: Verse 2]
