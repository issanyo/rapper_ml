Go!
I'm in love with a beauty
She is a cutie
Somebody say they saw us kissin' in the movies
We had a drink or two
We saw Rush Hour 2
Then we went home and we made our own movie

[Hook:]
Lights Camera Action ya dig?
Lights Camera Action ya dig?
It's showtime, it's showtime, show me yours show you mine

[Verse 1]
Like OoOoOo it's goin' down in dis bitch
Like a boxer in the first round in dis bitch
1-800 I would dick ya down in dis bitch
Uptown in dis bitch don't make a sound in dis shhhhh
Now let me whisper in ya ear
Every single word your little ear wanna hear
Flip ya body over have no fear
Can I put my tongue here until you tear?
Cry baby, cry baby, suck ya momma titty
You know I like dem old I might have yo momma with me
I like your girlfriend and your girlfriendses
Honor my pole like a flag on the end bitch

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I say ohh girl I love you so
Oh ohh girl I love you so (psych)

And "I wear my pants below my waist and

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Cut, check the gates
Wait, why wait?
When I can, just bend you over and do what I told ya
Do what I wanna, do what I wanna
Ya heard me, I gotta lie like ??
And now every once in a while her knees jerk
She forgets how to walk I better teach her
I got her walkin funny just tell em that your feet hurt
You'll probably see her on one of my t-shirts
I super soak a ho skeet skeet skeet squirt
But dont worry, cause if yall are like swingers
Hey im high over features
Haha new single, oh so now you single
You crazy, say da baby
