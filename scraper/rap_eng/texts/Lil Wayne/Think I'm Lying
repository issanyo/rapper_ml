[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Drop that coke in that hot water
And tell that bitch to hold her nose

[Hook: HoodyBaby (& Lil Wayne)]
Man I'm rich than a bitch Ho
You must think I'm lying
Wake up gotta get dough
You must think I'm lying
Got my jeweler fucking with me heavy
You must think I'm lying
You ain't want it you ain't really ready
You must think I'm lying
Man I'm rich than a bitch Ho
You must think I'm lying
Wake up gotta get dough
You must think I'm lying
Got my jeweler fucking with me heavy
You must think I'm lying
You ain't want it you ain't really ready
You must think I'm lying

[Verse 1: HoodyBaby]
They hold me dropping off the torch
I'm smoking out the Porsche
Real life street nigga made a million off the core
I don't even fucking hoop
I could really run and shoot
Ho you know I give and go
I could really duck and move
Homie Cap, bust your teeth
Ask him what's the booking fee
I don't need no fucking show
In my kitchen cook a ki
She say thank you I say please
All this coke you still want cheese
All that dough stuck in your nose
And you still gon' charge a G
Ho you know it's OHB
We got the game like ABC
Gave the profit to my ma, I been bumping Tracy T
I been leaning, I've been fiendin'
I've been praying for my demons
You must think I'm lying
I spent a hundred thou' this evening

[Hook: HoodyBaby (& Lil Wayne)]
Man I'm rich than a bitch Ho
You must think I'm lying
Wake up gotta get dough
You must think I'm lying
Got my jeweler fucking with me heavy
You must think I'm lying
You ain't want it you ain't really ready
You must think I'm lying
Man I'm rich than a bitch Ho
You must think I'm lying
Wake up gotta get dough
You must think I'm lying
Got my jeweler fucking with me heavy
You must think I'm lying
You ain't want it you ain't really ready
You must think I'm lying

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ten mil just last year
You must think i'm lying ho
I make cash, don't break even
I overlap your payroll
Straight to the point like Bledsoe
Fuck that, I take the foul
Settle out, no time for trial
My lawyer's with me, better call Saul
First round draft pick
My lifestyle need a contract
I'm Bo Jack in Egypt
That Wraith smell like reefer
Who that, nigga? I beat them, like Redman, I'll be dat
187, no drill team, get drill bit
I pull up my shit to these niggas and flaunt
I'm the nigga she want
I got all the shit that she want
T-Raw her boss, Trell got a mil in a vault
I'm just bein' honest
Oh you must think I'm lyin'
I'm not just an owner, baby, I'm also a client

[Hook: HoodyBaby (& Lil Wayne)]
Man I'm rich than a bitch Ho
You must think I'm lying
Wake up gotta get dough
You must think I'm lying
Got my jeweler fucking with me heavy
You must think I'm lying
You ain't want it you ain't really ready
You must think I'm lying
Man I'm rich than a bitch Ho
You must think I'm lying
Wake up gotta get dough
You must think I'm lying
Got my jeweler fucking with me heavy
You must think I'm lying
You ain't want it you ain't really ready
You must think I'm lying

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got some niggas in this bitch that got some niggas in this bitch
Mean muggin' like we suckin' on a lemon in this bitch
I'ma ball even if I fail my physical and shit
And I'm all about my digits, goin' digital and shit
Jumpin' on the couch until I'm short winded in this bitch
Don't judge a book by it's cover, start skimming at you, bitch
Where my niggas that be poppin' them prescriptions?
You ain't sick
Where my bitches that be fuckin' for that money?
You ain't shit
And yo bitch don't make no tips, and that sip don't make me itch
My bitch always think I'm lyin', I said I don't, she said "Since when?"
I'm a dog like Rin Tin Tin, fuck y'all niggas, y'all some hoes
Don’t trust y’all niggas, talk in code, don’t walk, I stroll, don’t walk, I drove
So park my Rolls, don't spark, I glow, avoid my woes, I brought my bros
But that nina always workin', cause I can't fuck with the part-time hoes
My bitch pussy multi-purposes, cause it take dick and hold my dope

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Drop that coke in that hot water
And tell that bitch to hold her nose,Tunechi!

[Hook: HoodyBaby (& Lil Wayne)]
Man I'm rich than a bitch Ho
You must think I'm lying

You must think I'm lying
Got my jeweler fucking with me heavy
You must think I'm lying
You ain't want it you ain't really ready
You must think I'm lying
Man I'm rich than a bitch Ho
You must think I'm lying
Wake up gotta get dough
You must think I'm lying
Got my jeweler fucking with me heavy
You must think I'm lying
You ain't want it you ain't really ready
You must think I'm lying
