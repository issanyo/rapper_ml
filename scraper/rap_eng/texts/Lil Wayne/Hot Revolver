Young mullah, baby
Umm, young mullah, baby

She sayin', do you have the time
To listen to me whine
She askin', who's on the other line
You diss me everytime
I tell 'em, baby I'm a star
Shit, I'm above a star
And now, I done got so high
I did forgotten who you are
Oh oh oeh oh oh eh eh, ah ah...

Im in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back up on the first flight
Right up out of town
Young mullah baby

She sayin', do you have the time
To listen to me whine
She askin', who's on the other line
You diss me everytime
I tell 'em, baby I'm a star
Shit, I'm above a star
And now, I done got so high
I did forgotten, who you are, are, are
Oh oh oeh oh oh eh eh, ah ah...

I'm in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back up on the first flight
Right up out of town
Young Mullah baby
Hop up on my spaceship
Girl I gotta drop your ass off
Last night, yeah we were spaced girl
You love it, girl I gotta take off
Cause I'mma be here next week
So call your company and take off
Oh oh oeh oh oh eh...

Cause she say "Wayne Wayne"
So she got me all impatient
Cry me a river, I can hear my conscious
While I say aloud

Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
You're like a hot revolver, hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And so she's gone to party town, on her own
And you go by yourself, so all alone

I told her I can be with her
But I can't be with her
As much as she like me to
She like me too much, that's the problem
Oh my god then, shorty be wildin'
And when I say I got to leave
You wouldn't believe all of the things
That she'll do and all of the things
That she'll say to make me stay
And I be like, daaaaaammmmnnnnnn

I been that boy for forever
I'll be back someday
But she wanna go with me to outer space
So we made love in the Milky Way and then I send her on her way
Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
Your like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one
But yourself
And so she's gone to party town
On her own
And you go by yourself
So all alone
