[Refrain: Christina Milian & Lil Wayne]
We be up all night, up all night
This is love
We be up all night, up all night
Don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Christina Milian & Lil Wayne]
Got my hands up high, so high
In the club
All my girls turnt up, cups poured up
All the boys wanna touch, they can't get enough
This is love
Think I'm in love

[Pre-Hook: Christina Milian & Lil Wayne]
Turn up, don't turn me down, just let my body go
I'm about to work right now, like in a video
I might make you twerk right now, like in a video
Like in a video, like in a video
Like in a, like in a, like in a video
Video
(We gon' get on down now)

[Hook: Christina Milian & Lil Wayne]
(She pop that, pop that) video model
She turnt up, sippin' red out of that bottle
She pop that, like a video model
She turnt up, so I hit it from the bottom
She twerk that, and I'm puttin' in dollars
She turnt up like a video model
She throwin' that ass like a video model
Stay twerkin' that ass like a video model

[Refrain - Christina Milian & Lil Wayne]
We be up all night, up all night
This is love
We be up all night, up all night
Don't give a fuck

[Pre-Hook - Christina Milian & Lil Wayne]
Turn up, don't turn me down, just let my body go

[Like in a video, like in a video
Like in a, like in a, like in a video

She turnt up, so I hit it from the bottom
She twerk that, and I'm puttin' in dollars
She turnt up like a video model
She throwin' that ass like a video model
Stay twerkin' that ass like a video model

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I run this bitch
Girl I let you run your mouth
She say "But I don't run from that dick"
Alright I go so hard I put it down
I put it down, I leave a dent
I am just tryna get my fuckin' mile, out of an inch
My ho a psychopathic with a fashion habit
Shake that ass, bitch, shake that ass, bitch
You a video model, action
And cameras don't lie, you the truth
Christina Milian, you the truth
So if your man screw up
You need a nigga like me, I'll knock every screw loose
I'm just sayin'
I'm not playin'

[Hook - Christina Milian & Lil Wayne]
(She pop that, pop that) video model]

She throwin' that ass like a video model
Stay twerkin' that ass like a video model
