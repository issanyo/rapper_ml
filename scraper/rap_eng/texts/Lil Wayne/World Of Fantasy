Living in a world a fantasy
(Living in a world a fantasy)
His back against the wall
Cut the music up in my phone
Living in a world a fantasy
(Living in a world a fantasy)
Perfect
His back against the wall

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart bitch like the times are medieval
Married to the block, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you straight to the needle
The bottle, the battle, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband used to beat you?
Remember when I went into the kitchen got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck either
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
You could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
I am her voice and the world is my speaker
I'm speaking

Living in a world a fantasy

[Verse 2: Question]
With my spine up against these tagged up brickwalls
Flip grams, quick hand, quicksand, pitfalls
Big balls intact through error Syntac's
The stormy weather where the trees don't bend back
Left home at 16, I ain't never been back
When it come to being broke they say I never been flat
A punk ass bitch, I ain't never been that
Reminisce on daddy's caught a schlitz in his lap
And it's Newport Box with only one stick left
Snort heroine, then he shove me in his chest
Used to really believe I'll never be the best
Hell must be on my shoulder cause the devil sing the rest
Right on it through his bignes with them poisonous syringes
Beating on my mama, kick the door of the hinges
I wish I was old enough to stop him when he did it
So long ago, but even I can't forget it, so listen

(Living in a world a fantasy)
His back against the wall
Living in a world a fantasy
(Living in a world a fantasy)
His back against the wall

[Verse 3: Question]
Demonic in my presence, street corner like a reverend
Trying to find the change, shining lightining light in heaven
Triple 7, triple 6 - tribulations, triple trick
Triple grip, triple spitting like I had a triple lip
Let's make simple sense of the main difference
Angel of Death swing, got a sinner in a clench
Revolver in my fist, earthworm to a fish
Bait on the line, watch me catch 'em with this
Coke fly off compound, off round white rock
Balling like Earl Manigault in his high top
Third eye cyclops, beaten down my five cops
Left for dead and this ain't even my block
Thinking of my pops, thinking of my moms
Rather be just blazing listening to Saigon
Cause when you think up God strike you down
Body full of current, lightning never hit the ground
