[Intro]
Oh yes I love her like...

[Verse 1]
Oh yes I love her, like Egyptian
Want a description?
Her body's sickenin'
I can be her prescription
I can be her physician
Sexual healing
I can be her religion
And now she's kneeling
Praying to the ceiling
I bless her
As if she sneezed
Must be the weather
I dress her
I am her sleeves
I am her feathers
She's fly, flyer than you
Flyer than me
I love her, she loves me too
I love her three â€“
Times more than her mom
Time will tell that I'm the nigga that
She should
We should
Be wherever she wanna be
On a late night, midday, AM
Just say when
And I know I be with cavemen
But nevermind them
She's Poison and I am Michael Bivins
See I know that y'all don't hear me
But she does
We does
What grown folk do
When they had too much to drink, and I think
We done had to much too drink, and

[Hook]
Oh yes I love her like; Pussy, Money, Weed
Pussy, Money, Weed; Pussy, Money, Weed

[Verse 2]
Oh yes, I love her like I oughta
I see you at the altar
Mrs. Carter
I see you with my daughter
Or son
More than one
Maybe Five, like the Jacksons
Or John Paxson
Just don't let em fuck up the mansion
And daddy will be home
Later on
Smellin' like the cologne
That I put on
This morn
And I hope
That you smell like woman's soap
And shampoo, and lotion, and perfume, and candles
And I'mma run through that pussy like a vandal
Yes, I'm nasty as a Scorpio, but I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like she's sweatin' out a fever
Wow
Leave her
To me and she'll be smiling
Every single time you see her
From ear-to-ear
I want to be beside her when she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated
Panties are debated
Einstein; her head is the greatest

[Hook]
Oh yes I love her like; Pussy, Money, Weed
Pussy, Money, Weed; Pussy, Money, Weed

[Verse 3]
Oh yes I love her like her dad told her
No man
Would ever love her
Oh, and
I better be the only man
Stickin' it
Lickin' it like an envelope
Mailin' it, sealin' it, read it
I have written down Victoria's Secret
Don't tell nobody
Don't share your body with nobody
Not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it
That ass for Weezy, baby
And at my station
We have sex orientation
When I hit it she squint like them Orient Asians
I do me
I say, "Hey Ms. Chun Li, I like to see your booty
Roll, like sushi"
I'm tryna dip my celery up in her bleu cheese
"Ahs", "Ooh-wees"
"Voilas", "Tah-das"
"Mhmms", "Uhh-huhs"
"Oh-yeahs", never "Oh-nos"
Until I have to go
And then it's: "Never! Oh, no"
I tell her, "Don't cry
I be back like the electric bill"
And when she's butt-naked, she's dressed to kill
