[Verse 1]
Wake a nigga up in his bed when he sleep
Tie the nigga up from his head to his feet
Then I light the nigga up from his head to his feet
Put his body in the water and his head on the beach
Light another blunt just to save me the grief
I don't give a fuck
I was made for the beef
I don't give a fuck
I'm straight from the streets
But I'm crooked as a bitch
Bitch wave to the thief
Lie to the bad guy, hi to the good dope
Ride with the bad guy
Try and you get smoked
Lie and you get smoked
Lie for a nigga though
Try for a nigga though
Die for a nigga though
Why would a nigga go to New Orleans
This is Katrina-land
The President flew over and he ain't even land
We ain't even mad
We ain't even playing
It's duct tape season in my region
And you ain't leaving until we eating
And I want my piece and I want my peeps to get their piece
And they want their peeps to get their piece
And until then tell you peeps no peace
I'm a beast and I feast every beat I seek
And I freak every mix CD I leak
I need to be at the t-o-p o-f h-i-p-h-o-p
And I'm i-n-d-a-c-u-t-w-i-t-h them Uzis

Yes, me
Call me Weezy West, B
Cause I'm wilder than the mothafucking Wild West be
I'm so ready, are you ready for me
I'm Young Money, Young Moolah baby
Break in a nigga car at the light
Put the gun to his head, make him park on the right and
Then I tell him don't talk
Make him get out and walk
And then I tell my goons get right in
When you're fucking with a nigga like me
No homo, but you're fucking with a rider
M.I.A. when a nigga try to

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fuck another motherfucker and them other motherfuckers
Cause can't no mothafucker fuck with a nigga
If you fuck with Lil' Tune
I’ma let my goons just follow your ass like Twitter nigga
We can do what you want I don't care
Anyhow, anywhere, anytime I swear
At sun up on a nigga
I will run up on a nigga
Put the gun up on a nigga
Now I'm one up on a nigga, yeah
I will run the clock behind the guap
And if my leg broke, I will hop
Bitch, I will hustle 'til I drop
Bitch, I will throw you from the top of the world
I got myself a Boston girl
She’s my gypsy, I'm her genie
Ride my magic carpet girl
Flow so sick you cough and hurl
I'm so twisted, I walk and swirl
I'm so lifted, I walk on clouds
Please, please, please, don't shoot me down
Fucking right I put it down
Buy it white then cook it brown
This is how great looking sound
KY bring the hook around

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hollygrove U.S.A
Parlez-vous Francais
Hot as picante
I am a zombie, what more can I say
Cause after all, I
I told y’all I tote it
Put the bullet in the Glock and blow that bitch
If you know like I know you'd put money way before that bitch
Everyone got they hand out so I drop my draws, let em hold that dick
I’ma roll that stick and I’ma roll it thick
And I know I'm colder when it's cold as brick
And I ain't that old, I'm just twenty-six
All in your mouth like I'm a dentist bitch
Fuck you and your interest bitch
We on some shoot the interest shit

And she feeling desperate boy
Don’t make her molest you boy

Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for forever, boy
