[Intro: Madonna]
My love's a revolver, revolver, revolver...
My love's a revolver, revolver, revolver...

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Oops, I guess I'll shot ya
My finger's on the trigger
I had a bullet with your name on it
Click-click
I'm a sex pistol
My love should be illegal
Real deal, baby
I'm no counterfeit
Click-click

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
My body's fully loaded
And I've got more ammo

Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
You're an accessory to murder, 'cause

[Chorus: Madonna]
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
I let it bang bang

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You've been hit by a smooth criminal
A bad girl, I gotcha crying to your mumma
Saying "I can't believe it" (I can't believe it)
I've seen your type, bring a knife into a gun fight
Caught up in the law right
I think I'm in love and I

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
My body's fully loaded
And I've got more ammo

Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
You're an accessory to murder, 'cause

[Chorus: Madonna]
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
I let it bang bang

[Post-Chorus: Madonna ]
I let it bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I line 'em up and watch them fall

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Bang
Tha shooting name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain, she just screamed "shoot again"
I gave her extra rounds, my barrel twist around
I am Mr. shoot 'em down, I leave hearts on tha ground
My love is a weapon, and yes I use it well
Then I let the rose petals cover up the bullet shells
I never shoot and tell, I only shoot to kill
And the vest ain't gonna help it even if it's made of steel

[Chorus: Madonna]
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
I let it bang bang

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
I let it bang bang

[Post-Chorus: Madonna & Lil Wayne]
I let it bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I line 'em up and watch them fall

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy? Yeah
