(LIL WAYNE)
Man a Rasta, shata, him oh fire and nobody enter
Them troop shoot them run like them playa?s oprah
They know me kingdom, make em scream like em see em opera
They smoke em weed, love em green like em grasshopper
Man ah, drink a bottle of crystal, and baby Ana Baka
But dnt think man slip, hima dreadda.. wat the picture wanta
Man a getin money, get tha bread to him bout stoppa
Youngmoney done done fly like em helicopter
U really wanna know wat goes in a nigga fofo
Bulletshot found on the street, im yellow dem voko
The president try and take him buy me, blow me bloco
Who? Rastafarian.. Juky gat them jump jump ( ya ya ya)
Flying uptown and kill tha man wen dey for rumble
Man a murder kid, for they mother, aunty and uncle
Man keeping me eye, in the rope
We play ay to.. if em playa ay to me, then we go up in the done blow

(SIZZLA)
Itz Ana poppin
Don?t sulting nobody
No no no stoppin
Boy, yall see me jumpin
No no no yackin

Actin up with a jumpin yah, im da loafin 4 rockin
Im da verse, up in mere factor words
Boy yall little, make we shoot you off tha face of the earth
Concerned, oh to mah, look how things turn out
Gang firm out, na their house
Them place gon burn out
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya, Gaaang- star
Me no take no charge bout me ready 4 da run star
Oh really, don?t be leaky
Ain't no pussies, but them bitches
Ain't no movie, ain't no comics
And no CNN, don?t be greedy
You dare not hear this song posted in a CD
No mess wit a mercy, less you can?t steal it
But be pretty..

And they actin oh body
See the giving where
The only reason why them bogus living
Ain't no way down, please stay down
Let them stay down, put them in a woodbox be laid down..

(LIL WAYNE)
Pussy ass nigga don?t talk to me
I make this bitch bring your heart to me
Im only 5 ?8 and yall short to me
And yall movement looks like its important to me
Your girlfriend opens up her part to me
And if she gimme brain, she smart to me
Puppy ass niggas don?t bark at me

Itz da big dog, call me Mr. Orkin fleas
Turn your block into a restaurant
Order and leave
What are u havin??? Organs please!!
And we stay strapped like Jordan?s beat
And we in tha center like Brad Daughtery
Ha..And im loken with Marly G
And we smokin so much, we could hardly breath
This other niggas flow is so watery
And im concrete wit this Carter 3

(SIZZLA)
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya, Gaaaanng-star
Man a take no child from me, Stop lookin at me and stop

Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya, Gaaaanng-star
Man a take no child from me, Stop lookin at me and stop

(T-STREETS)
Yessir, T ?street, bang bang back in tha building
They call me streets, so call me streets
If u call on reach, im on the streets
And im hungry like a dog on unleash
But im a tiger, and a dog is a feast
And I see through the fog in the trees
Because the nigga makes a logs and leaves
I walk through the jungle with a lion on my sleeve
I need a money donor, cuz im dying to resist
I know mama gat her eyes on her seed
Therefore, I never stop, I just proceed
Their eyes make the peace hard to read
But it says, ?why im not leave

(SIZZLA)
And they actin oh body
See the giving where
The only reason why them bogus living
Ain't no way down, please stay down
Let them stay down, put them in a woodbox be laid down..

(LIL WAYNE)
We killin em softly
We killin em softly
And man em hustle like a dog, and have keep police them off me
Pistol in da trunk, and the baby in da car seat
Drive fast lane, with them eyeball glassy
And about the hour, him a heading to the money
Take your coughin baby, give the baby back to mommy
Peer gunshot, shoot him below to him tommy
Bat the man down, boy, im shit around party
Party up, party up, they put the panty up
Sure gat the AK up, him a shoot the building up
We kill them softly, we kill them softly
He make bad girl them for want me, want me in tha storm ay
My girl she need me, my girl she want me
Because me reppin youngmoney, me youngmoney..
