[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
You know the boy from the damb streets, respect and expect me, I pack that heat
Especially if you threaten me
I got niggas that are ready for bief, that'll knock your head in the streets
Man, I'm known to turn bold niggas into ho niggas
Drunk more liquor than old niggas you might see on the corners
Me and Mike the type that you might see on the corners
At night, we take flight, see us on the corners
People be on us, and say open containers
15 spppen
?
Big heat in the palm of my hand
Touch my cheese, I'm offin your hand
When I bief, my niggas offer a hand
I ride alone, cause I'm off of the Xan
?


[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm a motherfuckin g
Come from under the smotherin of the slum
I'm bundlin up a ton, i'm pumpin it by that bump in the road
I'll leave you slumped in the road, if ever pumpin by my bump in the road
Come for no drama, i'm only tryna
Get up my dollars, my partners is screamin "sqad up"
I'm tryna get my squad up, holla at ya boy
I move so poised on old school boys
I'm a mack mami kill that noise
I got crack, chronic in that boy
I ain't just jumped off the porch, i been that boy
Fee- i'm a win that, boy
Don't even know where to begin that story about your woadie
I'm younger than kobe, vet like rob horry
I made it pop bubbly, your buddy is gettin chubbier than NORE
Honey say her hubby gettin boring
So honey be by money when you snoring
Stuff her from her gummies to her tummy to her ov'ries
It's over man, bet you don't know her man
Like the man from that hollygrove land that'll body yo man
My shotty fo cram hollow grams to yo noggo man
Head shot you mind boggled, man
I am the throwback young'n, about to bring it back to lotto's, fam
And bet i shit with multiple colored symbols
All of the shit i been thru, cause me to have my guards up over the god's mental
Raw deep dark top will offend you
500 confidential, a mark that the spark has been rekindled
Good morning i'm Tune, shorty the dude
Gucci border my shoes, hoochie all in my groove
Damn, wayne dookie hard on you fools, you gotta smell me
East landlord, shit go down you gotta tell me
Gangsta nigga, i ain't ya nigga
Nineteen, got game like an ancient nigga
Wayne came to paint your kitchen, drape your floors
Cover your ceiling, rape your whore
Smother your children, take your feelings, take your core
Shit, if this was the cell block i'd take your store
If this was the block i'd be moving a eighth or more
But i soar thru the block in that grape azure
I see hate galore
But i straight ignore
Because my cake is more
Peep how your date adore
Probly skate with yours
Take her straight indoors
Clean face, make her taste my pores
Give it to her till her waist is sore
Shake the boy
Go up in your lady raw, make your lady roar
And if she's as late as yours
I got snakes in my yard but i stay off the lawn
If a hater inform, take his head and his arm
Got the lead in my palm, infrared on the dome
Of the smith & wes
I aim at ya chest
I bang with the best
I hang with the S-Q killas
Niggas is gangsta to death
That's louis v from the ankle to neck
I move a v thru the block in the jects
No top, no shirt, people be like, "pac in the jects!!"
I don't stop in the jects
I got shop in the jects
Who knows? twelve hundred for two o's
Crew show, y'all hidin up
And when my crew show up, y'all squadin up
