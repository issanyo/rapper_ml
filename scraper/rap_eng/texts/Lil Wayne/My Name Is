My name is, my name is
My name is, Weezy Baby, and I'm high
Like maintenance, I'm smokin'
I'm drankin', leanin' daily, like, hi
My name is, you know what my name is
Bitch, I'm famous, like Tom Brady
And hi, your name is? Not important
Who cares? Not Weezy Baby, uh

[Verse 1]
Wake up, I see bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch
Makeup on my pillows make me mad, bitch
Without no makeup, I see that bitch as just average
Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Taxi
Looking at my Rollie, I got boogers on my Rollie
'Bout to hook up with my whoadies
Got the hook up on that codeine
Got the sugar for your nose ring
Got the blooka, I'm reloading
And according to my darling this dick feels so damn rewarding
I'm reporting out of shorty, she so naughty, me so horny
Kilo on me like I'm Tony, break it down to Rice-A-Roni
Take her out, look like she lonely, I'm gon' candlelight the moment
I'ma vandalize the pussy, she told him "My phone was roaming"
She be moaning 'til the morning, I be goin' in
I be on it, I be in it, I'm like Foreman on the grill
And I got doormen at the entrance
They got pistols in they trenches
They got rituals, religion
And I'm like, bitch, you know I'm sipping
'Til I die

[Hook]
My name is, Lil Wayne, bitch
Weezy, F. Baby, ha
Her name went, from whatever-it-was
To "Lil Wayne's bitch", now that's crazy
And I, I camed in, regained strength
Rebanged it, rotation
Her guy, he's nameless, he ain't shit
Always on the same shit, poor baby

[Verse 2]
I pour up so much they call me Pour Baby
Kush man, I need a sack like Charles Haley
Sipping to the Big Moe, I'm the Barr Baby
Sip got me moving slow but my thoughts racing, err!
My long days give me short patience
My heart vacant, awards taken
What in tarnation? No information, no statements
Young mula, old mula, mula all ages
Ha-Hallelujah, I'm the Hollygrove 2Pac
Roc-A-Fella, new rock, hundred K in a shoebox
AK and a new Glock go wap-ba-ba-loo-bop
Pray the vest you got save you like a coupon
Hustle 'til my dreadlock is grey as some Poupon
Every day is my birthday, I'm a newborn
Stay on my toes, ask a shoe horn, I ain't got no roof on
Gettin' my No Ceilings 2 on

[Hook]
And hi, I'm brainless, I'm stainless
Entertainment, his lady
And, um, if she ain't thick, then she ain't it
I can't fuck wit' a slim lady
I tried, but Superhead keep complaining
Bitch ancient, bitch shady and she tired
Okay then, I'm skatin'
Doing tricks, call me 'trick Swayze

[Verse 3]
Okay, In other news and other niggas' hoes
Your wife taste like Honey Nut Cheerios
I'm in the mirror, like "Ooh, baby"
Who needs a miracle when I got you, baby?
Pimping in my last life, I'm the shit you ass-wipe
Beat the pussy, cat fight, my teeth look like a flashlight
Weed is like a airline, 'cause easily I'm that high
Fistful of money, mix some green in with your black eye
Greedy like a fat guy, I'll eat a nigga franchise
I beat him by a landslide, a leader like a rabbi
I'm leading by halftime, he bleeding, I'm a vampire
His body in the trunk with his feet all on my Alpines
We the niggas, that's right, we all that and fries
Y'all on standby, my broads got cat eyes
Traphouse land lines, boom like land mines
All my bitches allies with Tune on their backsides

[Hook ]
So hi, my name is, on her anus
On her cranium, bitch cravin'
And I'm fly, and I'm wavy
And her name is Bust It Baby
And hi, my name is in your mouth, it must be tasty
Gone!
