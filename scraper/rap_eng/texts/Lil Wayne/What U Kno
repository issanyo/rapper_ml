I'm a New Orleans gangsta, after the storm
Boy it took bout 3 million to rebuild my home
But, I'm back on defense I'm back in the zone
I eat rappers and go in my yard and bury they bones
My pockets on Raven Symone
That's fat! Wutchu know bout that, huh!?!
See I'm a keep it goin', keep it movin', we can do it, I ain't trippin'
So far ahead of them niggas we got a time difference
Dont confuse me wit them, I'm different
Tryin to holla at TIP for a movie audition, shit
I push that Maserati to the limit
Zig-zaggin' through that traffic like Emmitt
I tell them niggas "Hurry and buy!"
And if you dry snitch, you'll get buried alive
Yeah, and I dont chase 'em like you do
I keep a bad bitch skatin' like New-New
