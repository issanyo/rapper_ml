I'd be a stupid motha fucka if I'm stuck in his pot
I ain't waitin to see what nigga out here love me or not
I say I hate em from a distance and they scopin' my neck
But these diamonds even cost me M-R and cars on my deck
And I can already vision people sayin I'm wrong
But I rather his momma than my momma singin that song
Besides chickens gon' be chickens and ducks gonna be ducks
And I'm all around guerrilla that love playin them cuts
Im'a attached to the streets, those niggas in the pens
Started problems wit ol' tymers that did ten
And this bitch curly head still been in the case
But he ain't man enough to leave a real one in the face
And to you 4-6 and 8 bitches wit t.v. Pranks
You jeopardize my living quarters, wanna see me sank
But I got news for everyone of y'all
I know who yah is, plus I won't be satisfied until I go in yah crib

[Hook]
Whatcha getting scared for? Don't get spooked
You was a bad mother fucker at first stunt too
Lookin fed up so me and Wheezy we comin through
And who ever sides yappin we gon' punish em too
(Repeat x2)

[Lil Wayne]
Armed and Dangerous, Rich and Famous, Young and Restless
Guns and Stretcha's, Crystal and dubs for breakfast
I just got one suggestion, ask yah Testem, this cuz get hectic
Send one through your son's intestines
Lock, snock lung through testin's
If the portrait, bodies piled up on porches, it won't be gorgeous
Ride with the torch, scorchin, ready to blaze
Step in me ways, kidnap your car for 70 days
And let it be said Holly Grove's the home of a soldier
And if a nigga breathe wrong than it's over
I never love ya, my metal slug ya
If you kept on fuckin wit the squad
Put the coward's stomach by his thighs, nothin survives
And as far as the coke, 20 bricks month and supply
And as far as the dope, plenty chips come and say "Hi"
Drop 3-2 roll, all black, buttons and shyer
I don't need you hoe
Jack my dick, cum in yah eyes
What?

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
Nigga C'mon
You gotta love us
Bumpin inside of humma's
Ride as thugga's, we who be
Think that them coward's busta's
Why we hustlin in they sleep
We be in that powder smuggle by the doubles every week
And if one of them cowards run up try to knock him off his feet
The brotha is Wheezy, love it or leave me
Gats hug it and squeeze it
Crack, bundle it easy
Run it wit these n' murderers, crooks and x-cons
Yah test mine I give it to yah chest 6 times
[Juvenile]
I believe in me and my family cuz niggas is broads
That leave you slanted, thugged out wit a conspiracy charge
All pussy ain't the pussy like money and drugs
I'm dickin bitches that trial and I'm the jury and judge
I make sure I separate it, though I hate when I love
Its just me, Cash Money Millionaires that wackin the plug
Wud-up Lil Wheezy, im laid back up in the cut if yah need me
Its love believe me
