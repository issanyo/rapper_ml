[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tell me something I don't know
I'm flexing on 'em like torsos
These niggas slipping like bar soap
These niggas listening, use Morse code
Boy, nigga sipping like parched throat
Ahe-he-hem, excuse me?
These niggas talking that beef shit
We'll check into it like the room's cheap
And all we sell is the greatest feeling on Earth
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got nothing left to prove, unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful corpse, yes, Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks
I sent five bricks with four chicks
Riding with these guns, that's carpooling
Bought extra clips when I dove in
Miss Snow White, we snowed in
Nigga, miss me with that ho shit
Kill all rats, I toast to that
And watch everybody I toast wit
Kill everybody you close with
Just don’t stick your nose in my bullshit
Cause I close it like a clothespin
The people that I rolls with
Will leave holes in what you drove in
If anyone in that car live
You tell that nigga I owe him, yeah
I got my mind right, my money right
My head on my shoulder
And my eyesight a little blurry, but
It's staying on my quota
And we find out Mom's address
And your head get mailed over
Nigga, you make that bed, you lay in that bed
Or get that bitch made over
Tunechi

[Hook]
You so crazy
Tunechi, you so crazy
Bitch, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say "Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, you so crazy"
Bitch

[Verse 2]
Tell me something I don’t know
I’ll tell you something I do know
Like money, drugs, bitches, guns
Niggas call me "Mucho"
Got witches all in my broom closet
Got little killers in JuCo
We’ll find out your business hours
And pop up like new toast
Like, danger taste like glucose
My shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes: kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
AK to your face; knock half off, like coupons
Too cool for school, but I sold cool points to schoolboys
Tell the cops, We don’t name drop, that's like droppin newborns
Nigga you crazy

[Interlude]
You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes made me

[Verse 3]
Nigga tell me somethin I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go?
And show me somethin I haven’t seen
And give me what helped Martin sleep
On the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been
But not to where I never be in
I ain’t never scared, but I’m scared of me
Me vs. Me, I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputy, big letter B
Need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything
From amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than nectarine and Grenadine, ha!

[Hook]
You so crazy
Tunechi - you so crazy. Bitch
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
You so cray, bitch

[Verse 4]
Tell me somethin I don’t know
Like what happened to hard coke?
You can call me Eddie cause I stay ready
My family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears
I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad, with corn rows
With boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancin in the finest mansion
With the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine, pills, and weed, liquor and dick
She gotta micro manage
I'm just eatin rappers
They go nice in salads
With some diced up carrots
I just like a challenge
Psychopathic, so psychopathic
Nigga give me credit, or my balance
Lil Tunechi

[Outro]
Stand up niggas
(And I bump my head when I stand up)
