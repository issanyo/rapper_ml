[Intro: Paula DeAnda & (Danja)]
Yeah!
(Yeah, Paula)
Ow!
(Danja!)

[Verse 1: Paula DeAnda]
I might be a young girl, but I know how to have fun
I got them boys chasing me, tryna make me the one
When I'm out shopping, it's like I'm having a gun
Whatever I wanna get, I got them boys caught up

[Pre-Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
I know I'm a hot, hot shorty
But you gotta slow down (slow down)
You don't know me (don't know me)
If you in a hot, hot hurry
Then you gotta go now (go now)
Back up off me (off me)
Uh-oh

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
Got them going crazy, you see (uh-oh)
Head over heels for me, oh (uh-oh)
Weak in the knees for me, boy (uh-oh)
'Cause you were so damn easy
'Cause you were so damn easy (easy)
'Cause you were so damn easy (oh)

[Verse 2: Paula DeAnda]
I'm much wiser than you think, better act like you know (you know)
Just because I'm a teen, it don't mean that I'm slow
I think you're a cutie boy, but you're turning me off
Sometimes you gotta play hard to get and then it's on

[Pre-Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
I know I'm a hot, hot shorty
But you gotta slow down
You don't know me
If you in a hot, hot hurry
Then you gotta go now
Back up off me (off me)
Uh-oh

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
Got them going crazy, you see (uh-oh)
Head over heels for me, oh (uh-oh)
Weak in the knees for me, boy (uh-oh)
'Cause you were so damn easy
'Cause you were so damn easy (easy)
'Cause you were so damn easy (oh)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
One take! Weezy!
Baby, tonight's the night
And them girls all on me like white on rice
And I get 'em to the crib, play two on one
I'm already hot, now it's you on one
Take a jet in to the sunset, you wan' come?
Or sit in my Phantom and chew on gum
Baby, I can take you to and from
Ice up ya little wrist 'til ya blue hand numb
Um, you dealin' wit' a boss lil' mama
Young Wayne, Tony Montana
And for you, I'll tell my homies "I'll holla!"
And if ya man ain't me, why bother?
I go by the name Carter
I got more plaques than tartar
I'm just checking out the charts on the charter
Number one spot, Wayne and Paula

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
Uh-oh
Got them going crazy, you see (uh-oh)
Head over heels for me, oh (uh-oh)
Weak in the knees for me, boy (uh-oh)
'Cause you were so damn easy
Uh-oh
Got them going crazy, you see (uh-oh)
Head over heels for me, oh (uh-oh)
Weak in the knees for me, boy (uh-oh)
'Cause you were so damn easy (no, no, no, no, no)

[Outro: Paula DeAnda]
Don't be so damn easy
Don't be so damn easy
