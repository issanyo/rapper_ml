[Kesha - Intro]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bouji friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
[Wiz Khalifa]
Okay I'm young and I'm tatted
I get them bucks like an addict
In this Christian Dior, I spend so much on my fabric
I got a wifey at home and what she wants she can have it
And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic
Okay no need to panic, I'm on a beach where the sand is
Somewhere smokin' on medication, no I won't need a bandage
Some would look at my age and try to say I'm young and I'm handsome
I say I'm filthy fucking rich, so I'm an old dirty bastard
And my cribs a disaster and my kush is the master
I was in my yellow car but my Ferrari go faster
Sounding like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Kesha, bout to go see the cashier
On the grind so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it
I look down and see a hundred thou' and think its time to get it
Brought a lot of marijauna and I'm here to share it
No it's not a problem, better get it, then I won't be here tomorrow momma

We start out so cute in our baby pictures
That momma shot for our daddy so that HE wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he'll remember
If not he's human, I'm human, you human, we'll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how momma hates him
He's such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I'm only 8, I'm not old enough, guess it's complicated
Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it don't get negated
I was gon' save it for later but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through through, but its the 1980s
But now that we are cool cool, she sippin' Irish Baileys
She say "Stacks, you're true blue?"
I said "Nah, I'm Navy"
I call her Kesha, she like it, because it's hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 because I'm good to her

Hey Kesha what up boo its me
Do you know what to do wit me?
Bad bitches, I got two of me
Well you better make it two or three
Bad bitches know me so don't bother introducing me
They want me more than diamonds
Wipe me down bitch, I'm super clean
I'm hella cold, mega paid, making moves doing things
Bitches stay queued and they all wanna do the king
I'm ballin', royalty, knew it when I seen her
I was gonna take her, make her my new royal penis cleaner
My demeanor something special and this dick is so impressive
Bitch I bet you take it off and take it with you if I let you
I ain't trippin', I'm just here, couldn't catch you when I catch you
Bitch my swagger super natural
Get you pregnant looking at you
I ain't nothing like them other dudes
I'm an atom bomb, they a molecule
Still paint ballin' out the frame, stuntin' like a fool

Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum

[Lil Wayne]
We be on that shit that no one be on
Thats what we one, smoke that neon
Kings of Leon, Dynamite Napoleon
Got some skinny's and a tee on
And some vans and my mans got the ratchet
While I'm laying in some pussy you be laying in a casket
And I'm just saying, I'm just spazzing
Im just smashing, Im just nasty
If you 'bout it, bust it open
Oh you fancy man, I got so many flows like mansion
Catch a tantrum, know a girl called Cleopatra
She a throw that pussy at ya
I'm financially straight like a lion
I ain't lying
And all my hoes on they toes
Ballerina, Black Swan
Man we on Ciroc, Grey Goose
It's Weezy baby, sleazy baby
Young Mula baby!
