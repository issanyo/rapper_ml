[Intro]
C3 be ready cause I know you can’t be
So be afraid, very afraid
Yeah, ha ha

[Hook]
I done warned you boys of the monster boy
I’m the monster boys
Feed me rappers or feed me beats, now I’m gonna eat
And now I’m gonna eat
I’m gonna eat you alive, alive, alive, alive
Eat you alive, alive, alive, alive
I’m gonna eat you alive, alive, alive
I’m gonna eat, I’m gonna eat you alive, alive, alive, alive
Eat you alive, alive, alive, alive
I’m gonna eat you alive
Now I’m gonna eat, eat you alive
And now I'mma gonna eat, I’m gonna eat

[Verse 1]
Welcome to Tha Carter, little shop of horror
Bloody like a period after d r a
Doctor I'mma dog, I'mma dog, I'mma dog you
Not Georgetown but I'mma uptown Hoya
Brothers like Warner, someone should’ve warned you
R E L A X like fucking California
Or get cornered then get tortured then get slaughtered, in that order

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Massacre music, lose it, loosens loosen a noose round my neck, I’m turning blue bitch
Bout to go stupid, that Hollygrove zoo shit
Keep a set of grip plies for ear pair loose slips
I done said I was too sick, I said I’m too too sick
Four sick, five sick, six sense, dead people
Just put ahead people, instant, instinct
I don’t care what color you is, I burn you turn your skin pink
And if you can’t stand me then knock me down
But I don’t wanna hear that shit like shit Foxy Brown
It's Weezy F. People
And I don’t talk shit like deaf people
New Orleans refugee like Wyclef people
My street eagle and nigga watch your ego
Cause if you think you too fly then I shoot down that eagle
And then the monster see you and the monster need food
And that monsters me too, so the monster eat you

[Juliana]
I done warned you boy of the monster boy
He’s a monster, yeah
Feed him rappers, or feed him beats
And now he’s gunna eat and now he’s gunna eat

[Ludacris]
I’m tired of playin with y’all boys
Wayne you ready, Luda, yeah
That's right I’ll eat you alive, Luda I’ll eat you, eat you
Till there ain’t nuttin left
Til the cops can’t identify none of your facial features
Letting out my rage, unleash the beast
Unlock your guest of honor
Let me out the cage I’ll eat these beats
I’m hip hops Jeffrey Dahmer
Can’t get to be defeated my spot is still reserved
Till you sell diamond nigga don’t say a fucking word
My flows are animalistic
Just say I’m a seasoned Vet
I received my masters in rapping you just a teachers pet
And I’m this seasons threat
Yeah I’m fucking mother nature
Flows so hard if you get up on the track I’ll make your own mother hate ya
Act like she don’t even know ya, act like she don’t even care
Ludacris turns rappers to ashes
Roll em up and put em in the air
It’s rap orientation and yes I’m glad to meet ya
I’ll bring the pain, ay Lil Wayne go get the anesthesia
For these none contenders for these rhyme offenders
Their time is not on my agenda bitch nigga

[Hook - Ludacris]
Cus I done warned ya boys I’m a monster boy
Ima a monster boy (thats right)
Feed me rappers or feed me beasts (feed me beats)
Ima gonna eat, Ludacris Im gonna eat (say what)
Im gonna eat ya alive
Eat ya alive
Ludacris I eat ya alive (I eat em alive)
I’ve always ate em alive (I ate em alive)
