[Intro: Future]
All white crib with the money count sittin' on the white counter baby yeah
All foreign whips, all foreign bitches sittin' in the driveway yeah

[Chorus: Future]
You pretend like you ain't that nigga when you that nigga
Try and pretend like my Maybach ain't bigger
Paid the extra ten just to get the Porsche delivered
I'm out of pennies, now I gotta hold it down for my niggas, yeah
I do Paris fashion, front row only drug dealers, yeah
I'd be glad to pass that lil hoe off to my niggas, yeah
This Paris fashion front row, when I dress ain't never left
I got the newest latest Maybach, this bitch can drive itself

[Verse 1: Future]
You a real rider, you a rider, shoot the chopper with your left
There some solid guys on the other side tryna get us dead
Got her naked dancin' Draco, she ain't playin' fair
She got two personalities, I got two percs on me
I'm 'bout that 500 degreez work on me
Too many problems with these freaks, can't let it work on me
I seen it first hand before it's holdin' you back
I let the first hoe I fell in love with play with these sacks
Started going crazy off of that pot drinkin' that Ac'
Start to have a whole lot stacks on me, servin' that crack
I done seen a whole lotta niggas make it then get jacked for it
I done had the same mentality every sentence I trap for it

[Chorus: Future]
You pretend like you ain't that nigga when you that nigga
Try and pretend like my Maybach ain't bigger
Paid the extra ten just to get the Porsche delivered
I'm out of pennies, now I gotta hold it down for my niggas, yeah
I do Paris fashion, front row only drug dealers, yeah
I'd be glad to pass that lil hoe off to my niggas, yeah
This Paris fashion front row, when I dress ain't never left
I got the newest latest Maybach, this bitch can drive itself

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
We pretend we ain't some killers but them killers know
We laughin' at your funeral but you don't get the joke
She actin' like she's beautiful, she need an actin' coach
You niggas actin' like some dicks but y'all some camel toes
My new car drive itself but my lil homie drove
I let these bitches drive themselves down a lonely road
I got 'em playin' with themselves when I be on the road
It's that Cali weed, I smell you hit it on the nose
She take D and not the L, yeah that's some smarter hoe
HNDRXX on her audio, do cardio to Carter IV
That new car drive itself, I'm gettin' head in traffic
Voice activated navi, I just say the addy, gone
I'ma ball out, she pay for her own season tickets, oh yeah
The car drive itself and pay for its own speedin' tickets, goddamn
I do Tampa with the street skaters, on the street niggas
And me I'm self-motivated and self-centered and self-driven, that's power steerin'

[Chorus: Future]
You pretend like you ain't that nigga when you that nigga
Try and pretend like my Maybach ain't bigger
Paid the extra ten just to get the Porsche delivered
I'm out of pennies, now I gotta hold it down for my niggas, yeah
I do Paris fashion front row, only drug dealers, yeah
I'd be glad to pass that lil hoe off for my niggas, yeah
This Paris fashion front row, when I dress ain't never left
I got the newest latest Maybach, this bitch can drive itself

[Outro: Future]
Started goin' crazy off of that pot drinkin' that Act
Start to have a whole lot stacks on me, servin' that crack
I done seen a whole lotta niggas make it then get jacked for it
I done had the same mentality every sentence I trap for it
