Got me a caddy and a trunk full of luggage in december, december
If it go through trial ill be missing every christmas like forever, forever
Lets go!
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But she call and I can't stop from pickin up the phone
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love

And you know
Feel like flowers in the morning after very bad weather
Out my mind all the time but the sign said take a new direction, direction

They say she bad for a nigga and I know it
But it seem like I can't keep my mind off her
And she a bad mothafucka when she make that kitty purr
And that ass real soft like fur
Word I'm trippin
No suitcase no luggage
Goin back in forth like Aaliyah I'm buggin
Her good love got me runnin back
But she give me head, make my eyes roll back
Gotta kick it like a bad habit
Yeah I'm addicted i'm her addict
Try to make a left turn, gotta go another route
But I make a U-turn now im back in front her house
Yeah all my niggas say I'm crazy, I might be crazy but she's amazing
Yeah all my niggas say I'm crazy, I might be crazy but she's amazing
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
Amazing is the love
