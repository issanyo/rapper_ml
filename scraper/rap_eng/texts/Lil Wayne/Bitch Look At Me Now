See I had this girl right
And all through our relationship
She would just tell me about how I'm not gonna be there for her
I'm not gonna do nothing with my music career
Then she'll run and tell her friends like
He's not this he's not that
He can't do this and blah blah blah
You know, It got to the point where I said What the fuck man
And you like, acting like I ain't got shit for you man
Showed You loyalty


So I just told her like
Te-Te-Te-Te Tell'em bout the Gucci that I bought ya
Te-Te-Te-Te Tell'em bout the coach that I bought ya
Te-Te-Te-Te Tell'em bout the phones that I bought ya
Te-Te-Te-Te Tell 'em it ain't matter what the cost was

Te-Te-Te-Te Tell'em you ain't give a fuck about me
Te-Te-Te-Te Tell'em you were tryna get the money out me
Te-Te-Te-Te Tell'em you told me I would be nothing
Te-Te-Te-Te Tell me why the fuck you out here bluffing
I tried to tell you babe
You don't believe me but now you gon see the stay
(you gon see the stay)
Cause I'm at the fucking top
I can't be stopped
This shit not in ya
Hold ya carI don't wanna be where you are
Cause I'm living like a fucking star



I told you, I told you, I told you I would be famous baby
You told me, you told me, you told me that I was crazy baby
Bitch look at me now
Bitch look - bitch look at me now
Bitch look at me now
Bitch look - bitch look at me now
I told you, I told you, I told you I would be famous baby
You told me, you told me, you told me that I was crazy baby
Bitch look at me now
Bitch look - bitch look at me now

Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho
Hold the Fuck up Bitch (Wait a minute)
When we in the bed, that shit should be documented
You act like... when in real I made you lose all feeling
Put that ass up to the ceiling
Then you start shi-shi-shivering
I told you you laughed at this would come back to haunt cha
Puttin' you on blast on like I didn't want ya
What happened to the promises promises that were made
OK, you changed but there's something I gotta say



I told you, I told you, I told you I would be famous baby
You told me, you told me, you told me that I was crazy baby
Bitch look at me now
Bitch look - bitch look at me now
Bitch look at me now
Bitch look - bitch look at me now
I told you, I told you, I told you I would be famous baby
You told me, you told me, you told me that I was crazy baby
Bitch look at me now
Bitch look - bitch look at me now
Bitch look at me now
Bitch look - bitch look at me now

Blowin' money(yes sir)
Throwin' money(yes sir)
It's snowin' money(damn)
These bitches surely done it
Make a snow angel
Let the bitch suck my dick
Now her throat famous
Now her-now her throat famous
Sharp gangsta
Sharp vanquish
And I could speak everything except court language
Snitches die ugly
So I forbid thee
And tell the bitch come get me
