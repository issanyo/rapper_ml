When I get up all in ya
We can hear the angels callin' us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang
I make that body sang, (Deezle on the beat)
I make it say

Doing a buck in the latest drop
I got stopped by a lady cop
She got me thinkin' I can date a cop
Cause her uniform pants are so tight
She read me my rights
She put me in the car
She cut off all the lights
She say I have the right to remain silent
Now i got her hollerin'
Soundin' like a siren talkin' 'bout
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
And I know she the law
And she know I'm the boss
And she know I can hide above the law
And she know I'm raw
She know I'm from the street
And all she want me to do is fuck the police

Talkin' bout
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee, (Yeah)

Mrs. Officer, Mrs. Officer
Tell your lieutenant get them cuffs off of ya
I'm Kidd-Kidd my face on every wanted poster
I'm wanted by every lady cop all ova'
That ass so big, I catch a battery to hold ya
Hands so big you thought I told you pull it ova'
She pull me ova'
Pulled me out the Rover
Then she pulled me closer
Threw me in the back of the car
Put me in handcuffs
Start rippin' my pants off
(All you hear over the dispatcher is..)

[Bobby Vasquez:]
Maybe you can lock me up and throw away the key
Call your sergeant and tell him you can't finish your shift
Cause it's on tonight
Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast and head
And I can't wait to get it on
I wanna do it all night long
