[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I did it for everybody out here on their own
I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages
And never tell me no
Come get me when I fall, and tell me when I'm wrong
But you should know I bought 'em
I changed it, I changed it
They say that shit the same, it ain't the same, though
I changed it, I changed it

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they on the same shit
Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they still on the same shit
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
The big 3 on the court, bitch at them bleachers
I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches
A bitch out in Atlanta eating them peaches
A bitch got more bars than where Big Meech is
No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no Lisa here
She gon' dread dissin' Nicki like Lisa hair
I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here
The bitch gambled her career, now it's gon' be severe
I just be watchin' bitches pitfalls
Stopped doin' pills, but bitch dem withdrawals
I am in my mansion rockin' pink drawers
I leveled up, bitch, I switched flows
MJ to the teens, I am Billie Jean and the bitch is my son
I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number, tell them bitches I won
This hoe gettin' slick, so I put on gym shoes and extended my run
MJ, game 6, (you my) Jackson, Tyson

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Quiet dawg, my phone changed up
I'm icin' out my Barbie chains up
And when I come, get your change cup
These bum bitches never change up

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they still on the same
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they still on the same
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
No more CMB shit, I changed it
Young Money shit, Mula Gang shit
Different hoes doing the same shit
Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went
Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen
Yeah, Carter time, I put bling on for the time
She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em "Let's beef"
Changing girls, change is fine
She don't like girls, change her mind
Change the world, change my line
Never ever change my slimes
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes
Me, Minaj, and Champagne changed the game
And y'all chump change
I'm just sayin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Quiet dawg, my phone changed up
I'm icin' out my Barbie chains up
And when I come, get your change cup
These bum bitches never change up

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they on the same
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they still on the same
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they on the same
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they still on the same
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Mula, Mula Gang
Mula, Mula Gang
Mula Gang, Gang, Gang
That your boyfriend? That shit disgusts me
