[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I know it sound crazy, but I always love my lady
Even if she went crazy like a third floor patient
You're my Pamela Anderson, I'm your Tommy Lee
We break up every year like T.O. break up teams
I love the way you used to break up all my weed
We'd smoke, we'd drink, 'til we reach ecstacy
Goddamn, she got the best of me
808 and Heartbreaks got me drinking extra lean

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Gangstas don't ask, they just let it be
Too many tears that I would drown, so I'ma let you breathe
Gangstas don't ask, they just let it be
Too many tears that I would drown, so I'ma let you breathe

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & (Shanell)]
And I remember everything, baby
Traffic jam, memory lane, baby
Yeah, it might hurt, but it's a sweet pain, baby
I know I got you open, be my key chain, baby
It's a G thang, she got a G-Strang
Ooh, but she ain't choose to wear it this evening
Now let the beat bang, just let the beat bang
And shawty, yeah, it might hurt, but it's a sweet pain
Weezy (Baby)

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne & (Shanell)]
Too many tears that I would drown, so I'ma let you breathe (Baby)
Too many tears that I would drown, so I'ma let you breathe

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Oh, oh
I don't need that hoe no more
'Cause I got a shawty from the West side
She tell me let's drive
And she let me take the wheel of her sex drive
We pick up Keisha, she on the East side
And then the three of us do-do-do it three times, ooh
Oh, oh
I don't need that hoe no more (Ba-ba-bangladesh)

[Verse 4: T-Pain]
Okay, let's go, listen, ayy
I party in the U.S.A., call me Teddy Montana
Yellow Bugatti could've drove you bananas
If you gon' leave, hol' up, let me get my camera
My new bitch finer, let that jelly out, jam ya
And the head game sick like cancer
Upside down, porn star, break dancer
I go H.A.M. on Mariah Carey-looking hoes
So all of them bitches call me MC Hammer
Ha, so I'ma say you dead wrong
And I can't hear you like I got on Dr. Dre headphones
Whoever you with, have fun
'Cause I know he can't make that pussy talk
So until we meet again, shawty, just go 'head and walk

[Bridge: T-Pain & Shanell]
Walk, walk, walk, walk
Go 'head and walk, walk, walk, walk
Just go head and walk

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Too many tears that I would drown, so I'ma let you breathe
Too many tears that I would drown, so I'ma let you breathe

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, T-Pain & Shanell]
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe
I'ma let you breathe
I'ma, I'ma let you breathe

[Outro: T-Pain, Lil Wayne, Both & (Shanell)]
Too many tears that I would drown, so I'ma let you breathe
Weezy (Baby)
Oh okay, T-Peezy (Baby)
Lil Weezy (Baby), T-Peezy (Baby)
Weezy (Baby), Peezy (Baby)
Yeeaaahh
It's T-Wayne, man
Breathe
So I'ma let you breathe
And I'ma let em breathe
T-Wayne, he rap, he sangs
Okay, Young Mula Baby
