Dat beef stroke, and make her bite her fist
The lights is on, the night is grown
We get it poppin cuz we know we can when wifey home
California kush strong as a tightness what im lighten on
We get high as fuck and we just do it put ya nikes on
Tatoos on her waist she like the tatoos on my face
And if there's sum she like to say I let her say it on my microphone
She love my style, but thats expected
She comin back to you, the chance is anorexic
I new she had it in her, so i got it out her
She give me neck around the clock i call it round a collar
She rub my back, she say im tight
She cook fucking clean
And still make her flight

And I get foreign head
She sit down and ride
Like I'm a thorough bred
She kiss mine
And I kiss hers back
If she's a bad bitch
