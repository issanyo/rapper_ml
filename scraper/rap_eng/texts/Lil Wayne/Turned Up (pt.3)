(I don't remember these hoes, I don't remember these niggas
Fuck niggas, bitches too, all I see is these figures
I got Versace on, Versace lights, I ain't seeing these niggas
Chances here, chances are three on three with these niggas
Look, all bark no bite, all rap no white
Two of her friends to get with my friends so we can be friends well alright
Machine gun, we got one, machine gun I got one
See me, I'm a real nigga, probably mad at me cause he not one
That's straight chopper music, no bite, eighteen dwarf niggas, Snow White
You can bet a nigga if I said a nigga, ten out of ten, it's no white)
[Bitch better have my money
Don’t test me muthafucker I study
And wifey keep tellin’ me the pills gon kill me
Fucking up my sperm count and she want children
Back on my bullshit, I’m back on my bullshit
I’m a dead man walking, follow my footprints
Scared, go to Church, I shoot at the pulpit
My girl pussy sweeter than a whatdyamacallit
I don’t worry ’bout ‘em, I say hi hater
I throw you off the top of a skyscraper]

To we fall (to we fall)
Every single day I go and freaking ball (ball)
We getting turned up (turned up)
