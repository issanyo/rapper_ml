[Intro: Short Dawg]
Yeah
I'm in the lab
No pad
No pen
Just a styrofoam cup
I can pour 4 in

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Up in the studio
Me and my drank
Deezle on the beat
And let me do my thang
Thinking 'bout a certain
Certain somebody
That perfect somebody
Sexy purple body
She got service road curves
And highway eyes
The road to her soul
Just follow the road signs
And holla if you hear me
I love it when she's near me
I hate when she's away
And Satan'll see the day
That Hell freeze over
Before I let her go
And let one of you bitch niggas get her
No, no, no
You don't know how to treat her
You don't know that I need her
Hey, do you know that I need ya?
'Cause baby, right now
It feel like the whole world is against me
Ever since the death of Pimp C
But me
I'm up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
I'm up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
And you sit on 24's
I sip on 24's
You sit on 24's
I sip on 24's
Drop a 4 in a 20 ounce
And call it 24's
Drop a 4 in a 20 ounce
And call it 24's
I'm riding out
Leaning
Never nodding out
My girl tripping
Damn I gotta hear my momma mouth
My homeboys say I should slow down a little
But that shit I'm on make me slow down a lot
You bottle pop
I buy a bottled pop
Drop some syrup in it
Get out my Waffle House
I live in Wayne's World
Represent our South
And this how we do it
Do it in our South
One more ounce'd make me feel so great
Wait
Now I can't feel my face
Up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Will somebody please-please double cup me
And everybody please-please don't judge me
Will somebody please-please double cup me
And everybody please-please don't judge me

[Hook]
Up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me-me-me and my drank

[Verse 2]
Now for all y'all who ain't heard of him
Mr. M.O.E
The Barr baby
Was a southside living legend
Of 3rd ward
Bone hard
Street veteran
And it all started in '93
Highschool
He was a fool
He was only 18
With the dreams
Of becoming a ghetto superstar
Rolling in foreign cars
Through the streets of 3rd ward
It was all momma leave 'em with, a trace of Mo. E
And promethazine
And he the codeine fiend
And his team was the coldest
Everyday they rolled thick
Niggas and hoes on dick
'Cause that's that screwed up clique
The Barr baby, the Barr baby, Barr baby
Yeah, I sip that Big Moe
I drink that Pimp C
Rest In Peace Big Moe
Rest In Peace Pimp C
I sip that Big Moe
I drink that Pimp C
Rest In Peace Big Moe
Rest In Peace Pimp C
And fuck what they say
Mr. DJ Screw
I'mma do this for you

[Hook]
Up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me-me-me and my drank

[Verse 3: Short Dawg]
Yeah, yeah
I usually don't do this but, uh...
Yeah, T you gotta feel me
Sippin' on some drink
The color purple like Celie
Really
They say I should chill
Before it kills me
But so will
A car crash or a nine milli
(That's true)
And I ain't even mention cigarettes or airplanes
So grab a Sprite
Heres a pint
We can share, Wayne
Yeah Mayne
Tastes so sweet
And I ain't gonna have a seat
'Cause I don't wanna fall asleep
So just pour it in my drink
And I'mma sip until I lean hard
Drink got me moving slower than a retard
So press record
And hear these hot raps
(You know I got 'em)
I'm in the booth
Cup on me like a jock-strap
(I ain't lying)
And I will not nap
Until the bottle's empty
Then I pour a little more
For Pat Screw and Pimp C
(Rest In Peace)
And I would stop
But believe that I can't
So 'til Short is gone
It's just me and my drink

[Hook]
Up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me-me-me and my drank
Up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio
Me and my drank
Me and my drank
Me-me-me and my drank

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Short Dawg]
Up in the studio me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
Me and my drank
Up in the studio
Someone pour another 4
Ohh, oh, yea...
I told the bitch
One more ounce will make me feel so great
Wait
Now I can't feel my face
Will somebody please-please double cup me
And tell the world please-please don't judge me
Will somebody please-please double cup me
And everybody please-please don't judge me
You sit on 24's

Drop a 4 in the 20 ounce
And call it 24's
Drop a 4 in the 20 ounce

Just a styrofoam cup
So I can pour 4 in
