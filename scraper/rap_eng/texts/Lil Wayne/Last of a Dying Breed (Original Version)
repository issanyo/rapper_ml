[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda!
I done killed so many niggas in the booth I sell rappers on eBay
Soldiers couldn't cause more disaster on D-Day
Haters better cover up they jaw like Freeway
Cause every hit record's been instant like replays
Hold the line, I got yo' momma on 3-way
Tell her Luda's got more records than the DJ
Tell her she should blow me like candles on yo' B-day
Cause I've signed more lines than she's passed on the freeway
More checks than you ever could imagine
More wood up in my whip than in a forest full of cabins
And yes I stay high on that purple like Aladdin
And women say I talk mo' game than John Madden
How'd it happen, how'd they let me in the booth?
How they let these rappers lie, how DARE I tell the truth!
I'm the truth, and these other boys phony
It's a movie so act like you know me

[Hook One: Ludacris] {w/ scratches by DJ Jaycee}
I'm a lyricist to the death, so I got what you need
Ludacris, I'm the last of a dyin breed
And we almost extinct, so I'm sayin it loud
Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
Say it with me! {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
{*scratches: "M-MC means move, means move... m-move... move the crowd"*}

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got it baby!
And I'm an MC, I move the crowd like Moses
Like the Red Sea I wear red like roses
Go against me and you'll be dead like roses
Spittin at your head full of bread like toasters
Never had a holster, I keep it on my lap
And hip-hop ain't dead, it just had a heart attack
But you see I keep it pumpin, yeah I got that heart back
So just call me Little Carter, or Little Cardiac
Precious like an artifact, valuable like a quarterback
Hannibal like they call me Jack, throwback like a Starter hat
Now how did he thought of that? I mean how did he think of that?
I mean how did I think of that? Now like a rental, bring it back
I mean how did I think of that? I surprise myself sometimes
Someone should throw me a surprise party for every rhyme
Every time I do it, I do it dirty like swine
For the dirty and fine, hip-hop, I'm alive!

[Hook Two: Lil Wayne, Ludacris] {w/ scratches by DJ Jaycee}
[W] I'm a lyricist to the death and I got what you need
[W] Weezy F, the last of a dyin breed
[W] And we almost extinct, so I'm sayin it loud
[L] Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
[L] Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
[L] Say it with me! {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
{*scratches: "M-MC means move, means move... m-move... move the crowd"*}

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
This is music Musclemania, my verse is on steroids
Private planes, I'm on the jet, son, like Elroy
Flying through the sky at amazing speeds
We on that Superman kush or that amazing weed
The new Bentley came out, my team said, "Luda, get it!"
20 thou' says that I'm the only nigga wit it!
New Era on yo' brain like a A-town fitted
And I'm not E-40 but I'm so Sick Wid It
That my flow got the flu, hoes I got a few
But I'm stingy with the dough, I'm like "No not for you!"
What the fuck was you thinkin, off what I'm thinkin
Me and Wayne on that lean, what the FUCK was you drinkin?
Stinkin like a dead body off in the woods
So I snatched her like a weave comin off in the hood
And if you down for no bad, then we up to no good
And it's important that you make it understood

[Hook One]
