[Into: Lil Wayne]
No ceilings
Haaa, yeah!

Party on the beach
P-party on the beach
Party animal, baby let me off the leash
I got my weed from the west
My pills from the east
And two bottles of Goose, that's geese

[Hook: Mack Maine]
No ceilings

Tonight's gonna be a good night
Tonight's gonna be a good night
Tonight's gonna be a good good night

No ceilings

Tonight's gonna be a good night
Tonight's gonna be a good good night

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ahem
Tonight’s the night, I’m high as height
Uh, I’m young and restless, I shines my guidin' light
And umm, I’m livin' right, yeah my health alright
Huh, my money good, and my girl a dyke
Shit, let’s live it up, no dyin' down
Yeah, let’s shoot the bar, I’ll buy the rounds
Hey, I’ll take the shots, I’m bulletproof
Yeah, Nike just do it, I do what it do
I was drinkin' before I came, when I got here I did the same
I don’t like beer I like champagne, so cheers to Lil Wayne
And if she think she get my number, just hope my number don’t change
Girl stop playin', I got that pussy on a string
Now let’s do it

[Bridge: will.I.am]
Let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it (No Ceilings)

And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it (ahaha)
Let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it (Young Mula babbbyyy)

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Okay
Kush got my Dutch fat ass fuck, Weezy F. I’m bad as luck
I’m already at the top, I’m bout a pull the ladder up
Flow crazy, I need a counselor, I’m Hip-Hop’s announcer
I’m in the gun club, do you want to meet the bouncer?
Been a beast and still I am, now I rock and still I jam
Few niggas with me got that white girl like Will.I.Am
Look up bitch, ain’t no ceilings
See me at the top controlling things
Anybody beat, it’s a mothafuckin' murder scene
I do it

[Bridge: will.I.am]
Let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it
And do it, and do it, let’s live it up
