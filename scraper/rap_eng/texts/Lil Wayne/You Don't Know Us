[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I do this when I wanna, momma
I hustle when it's hotter
Money, gun, weed in the water bottle
I'm the coolest in the sauna, momma
I ain't sweatin' it, I'm bettin' it
I'll make it back tomorrow, momma
I got corner honor
Ain't been to court since 2004
Looks like I got it goin', your honor
I'm a lone rider, grind for my own dollars
They was in front, but I blow by 'em
[??]
I'm all holes like corn-rolls, open toes
Fake titties, yes, I bought both of those
Hold your nose, I'm the shit, can't be flushed
I got the toilet stopped up, call the plumber up
My stomach's stuffed, that's right, I'm eatin'
I smoke the best weed, look like I'm sleepin'
[?] evening, off it by the morning
Professional dope-boy, my office is Tha Carter
Yes I do, and I do it better than most
My competitive drive knock a nigga off the road, yeah
Lock and load, pull the triggers and roll, yeah
The bigger your mouth, the bigger the hole, yeah
We figured 'em out, them niggas is hoes, yeah
They lawn chairs, baby, quicker to fold
But me, I'm quick on my toes, I remember the code
You need a pass for the hood, watch me get through the toll
Shit, I been through the cold, I shot through the fire
Still rock too much ice, shoulda got you a visor
I pull up, the bitches flockin' at my [?]
Fresh like I just stepped outta the drier
Yes, no threat, I got the locker for lyin'
[?] the whole block's behind me
Yeah, stay low, the cops are spyin'
But they could never figure out the rocket science
No pocket knife, no pocket iron
Yeah, pots and pans make the pockets wider
Dig 'em a hole, let the property hide 'em
Build a house and throw a party over your dead body
Never said I never fell, but never dropped an assignment
Gotta finish what you start or the cops'll find it
Dinner in the park, yeah it may seem cool
But me, I'd rather not let 'em see my food
I'm stayin' strapped like Fila shoes
Bet I bust a motherfucker till the enemy move
C'mon, it's my game, nigga, get in and lose
Ya'll niggas never did what I do
I do me..

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Streets'll swallow you in this
So many bricks that you could build a mansion
With the house guest house, and a room for expansion
Twelve rooms, eight baths, don't make me laugh
Twelve rounds on my hip, don't make me blast
It ain't no secret, hoes is about it
Was flippin' that soft white before I ever became famous
A few tried, but they shall remain nameless
Lunar eclipse, they try to block my shine
Say what the fuck you want, can't stop my grind
One million, two million, three million, four
What the hell, maybe it's twelve
So listen little mane, this before the rap game
Before them videos, before all of them shows
Look at me now, nigga, I rock my own clothes
Mow my bitches, yeah, I make my own hoes
