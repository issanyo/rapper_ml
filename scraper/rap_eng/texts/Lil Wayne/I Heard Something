[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
I think I heard something, the way your body sounds, it makes me want to do something
And your ? once around, got my speakers bumping
Your trebble's so hot, but I need to feel your base bumping
So turn the volume up, and shh
I think I heard something
The way your body sounds, it makes me want to do something
And you ? only once, so? it's got my speakers bumping
So go ahead, and let me know you ain't afraide of nothing
So turn the volume up and let your body talk
La la la la, la la la la
And make your body talk some more
La la la la, la la la la

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I can make her body talk to me
I can make that thing  jump off her, and walk to me
Baby girl, you're looking like a theam park to me
I mean, you're looking like stars in the dark to me
I feel like I'm on mars, and you're apart from me
Leonardo, making love is an art for me
New Carledo kinda small, but it works for me
Baby doll, I'm at your neck like a shirt button
What you tryna do, twirk something
I can make it feel good when it hurt, honey
Left you alone, the nerve of him
Shsh, I think I heard something
