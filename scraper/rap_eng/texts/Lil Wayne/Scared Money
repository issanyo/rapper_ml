[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I ain't never been scared, you heard what I said
If anything look, I'm over prepared
They on that bullshit they don't want no bread
It's like tellin' a bad bitch I don't want no head, Damnn!
Not me I tell that bitch to go ahead
And when she done what she doin', I tell that bitch to get bread
Done doing that I tell that bitch to get dough
Done doing that I tell that bitch to get more
Welcome to the mind of a hustler a staright skitzo
I am never scared of the money I got my pistol
I am never scared when the block hotta than crisco
Call the hood your yay area bitch just call it Frisco
So listen up, tell menace I'm talking shit though
Silverado sittin' on thirties I call it tip toe
They say you nobody till your ass in the feds
Can say the fuck you want, you can't say that I was scared

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeeaaahhhh!
Young Mula in this mother fucker
I ain't never scared of the money call me bone crusher
Stick my feet in the dirt like a long jumper
And I wish a mother fucker wood I chop lumber
I'm a hustle junkie I'm a grind slave
More money than mistakes is what I've made
Money on my mind, I got my mind made
If money grow on trees I'm tryna find shade
Shiitt!, you niggas running from the money
And I treat it like pussy see I got the money cumming
Scary ass niggas I bury cash nigga
Cream in my pocket, strawberry flag nigga
Get the money first that's to every last nigga
If you scared stay broke gon' get a cast nigga
Scary money don't make no money
Old pussy ass nigga I take your money
Uhhhhh...
