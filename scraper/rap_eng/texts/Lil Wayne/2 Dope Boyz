[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Thinking of a master plan, I get money
But I'm thinking of a faster plan, I'm trying to cash it in
I got five in that garbage can
And the wrap saran, I need cash advance
See, I know three sold, the other two a jam
I'mma sit on one and whip the other one much as I can
Hot-ass fuckin' sedan, windows rolled down, no sound
Them bricks got the speakers drowned
I ain't listening for shit but sirens
I ain't trying to get to my ships sunk, fuck you pirates
I'll touch you cowards, it ain't nothing to a boss
The niggas in the hood tryna floss and ya head got a cost, nigga
Take a loss nigga, SS 55
All black, with the top chopped off that
Catch me in the spots where the shots pop off at
I ain't trying to prove nothing, I'm just trying to move something

[Chorus]
Just 2 dope boys in a Cadillac
It's just 2 dope boys in Cadillac

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Now let me introduce the world to my girl
She white, she bright, she shine like a pearl
And I ain't talking 'bout Lindsay Lohan
I'm talkin 'bout that sniff that blow man, (what?) that
One hit that'll get you open
Might make your nose bleed, if it's potent
So if you're not ready, homie don't tamper with it
She the chick who had Tony Montana slippin'
She so bad she make you mad
But soon as you get mad, she make you cash
That white girl, but she ain't always that light
She ain't always that bright, she ain't always that white
Nope; gimme one girl, I mean one gram
I'll teach ya how to give a white girl a suntan
Put it in that pot, 'til it get that hot
Then start to Sir Mix-A-Lot
Aye!
