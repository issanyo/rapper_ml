[Verse 1]
Re-re-reporting from another world
Look up in the sky and see me courting with a cover girl
She know that it's "bye" after I'm through then it's another girl
I can make your wife and your sister fuck your brother girl
Rockstar biatch, check out how we rock
And if this ain't hip hop it must be knee-hop
I'm higher than a motherfucking chronic leaf treetop
I make that Nina sing like, "Shooty-do-dee-wop"
You want the facts, Daddy? Well I truly do me, Pop
And I get my candy from your girlfriend's sweet shop
Still get a stomachache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker, cause we not
Yeah you bitches better run till your feet stop
And I'm so fed up with street cops
I'm colder than a ski shop, I'm holding onto the top
And even if I let go, I still won't d-rop

[Refrain]
I am the rhyming Oasis
I got a cup of your time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racing
I thank God that I am not basic
(I am not a human being)

[Verse 2]
Rockstar baby
Now come to my suite and get lockjaw baby
I can knock your boots and your socks off baby
News flash, your boyfriend a knock off baby
Okay real shit, you can get knocked off baby
And I'm like a champagne top, I'm ready to pop off baby
You really lucky I don't kill if it's not for Baby
Got so much money, I can look at the cops all crazy
Rockstar shit for my rockstar ass
Got a tub full of money, that's a rockstar bath
Then I use more money to wipe my rockstar ass
Then I throw it in the garbage, that's rockstar trash
I wouldn't try you, I wouldn't lie dude
I'm must be sticky cause them bitches got their eyes glued
Big B bitch, I'm so motherfucking damu
Staring at a mountain like, "Bitch, I will climb you"
I stand tall like I'm motherfucking 9'2"
I scream motherfuck you and whoever designed you
And if you think you hot then obviously you are lied to
And we don't die, we multiply and then we come divide you

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
I'm rockstar bad
With my rockstar glasses and my rockstar plaid
This the school of hard rock, I'm a rockstar grad
And my kids are proud to have a rockstar dad
Now Mama, let them titties bounce like rocks off glass
And if you do I'll probably call you like shots off glass
Don't jump into my water cause you're not gonna last
I swear I'ma be like a shark that's locked on bass
Rockstar life, rockstar bright
And in the mosh pit is how a rockstar fight
So jump up in this bitch and catch a rockstar right
And the cops could never violate a rockstar's rights
Yeah, now I'm back on my grizz
And y'all's a bunch of squares like a motherfucking grid
And everybody get it, well me I get rid
Of he who say he get it, and then I get his
No marquee, but this is big biz
And I scream, "Fuck it, whoever it is!"
Ain't no motherfucker deeper than me, bitch, dig!
And I thank God everyday that my children are rich kids

[Refrain x2]
