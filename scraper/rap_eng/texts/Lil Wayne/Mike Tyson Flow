I'm the most brutal and most vicious, and most ruthless champion there's ever been
No one can stop me, I'm the best eva!

[Verse 1]

Uhhn! like mutha'fuck all yawl

Hear me? To a lion you are just deer meat
Fear God, fear me siry us us
Pe pi them try them and die when I say so
Weezy F hardful red go like Craig go

[Verse 2]

Ho I go so hard
I'm so gone my I.D is a post card
I travel like b-ball with no calls
I play my role and listen out for the roll call
This is a movie and every movie must go off
But this gangsta doesn't die like O-Dogg
Say what up blood, what the lick read!?
5 star general, in the 6 speed
Still hood like thick cheese, bitch please
Him squeeze quicker than the wind breeze
Niggas betta trim trees
Simply shoot yours empty if b turn dat thick cheese to swiss cheese
Folla me! A part of me!
Fuck around and see a whole notha side of me
I separate yo body with them hollow tips; biologist
Photographies, picture me in yo bedroom with a mask on
Pistol to yo head while you puttin' yo pants on
Peyton Manning offense, Singletary defense
Super-duper-extra-much-really-very-street shit
That is how I keeps it, R.I.P Beepsy
I do it how I do it cuz I know my niggas see me
And I'mma hold it down bitch, hope that crown fit
The boy got a flow, that you can drown in
When you in the water watch them sharks, when you in the water watch dat salt
Young Carter no floss that was so raw ohw!

[Mike Tyson talking]

My style is impetuous
And I'm just ferocious, I want to eat his heart..
..I wanna eat his children
Praise be to Allah!

[Verse 3]

Are ya plastic? Gasoline on ya contract
Fuck a pen I need a match, Fuck a bitch I need a batch of bitches
Yawl niggas act like a bunch of bitches, blood bitches leave ya in a tub
Blood bitches, young niggas, Young Money, young niggas, fuck pistols
