[Verse 1-Ca$hma$e]
I need a satellite booty, that’s ass with no gravity
Boomerang girl and give that ass back to me
Ass so fat it was built in a factory
Now throw it back, ass satisfactory
I’m so faded man I squint like a Japanese
I can’t leave the club, bad bitches trappin’ me
Like where you goin’ Ca$hma$e do the bob and weave
3 syllables bitch I’m a ath-a-lete
Glass strips, dolla signs time to lace my cleats
Two hand touched on that ass her pussy tackled me
She wanted dick dollas fuckin’ my economy
I’m kind to you, my eyes are red and Ciroc is blue
What it do big hitta?
I’ll fuck ya baby mama take ya baby to the sitta
She gave that sweet dome so why her baby daddy bitter?
Bitter? Bitter? Bitter?

[Verse 2-Tactic$]
Come and give it back, I don’t mean return it
Say my name back to me, that’s what I’m concerned wit
Drop it then you turn it
You lookin’ perfect
Give it back, bring it round and round like whirlwind
Booty pop bounce, shakin’ like a shake weight
Love the way it girate, heart is goin’ irate
Yes, I’m talkin’ beatin’ out my chest
You the best, I’m impressed
Ain’t no need to second guess
Hands up, sweat drippin’ with ya ass low
All up on me cuz you know I’m bout my cash flow
Lames pissed, they don’t get it like a bad joke
Bring it down low, last call let’s go back home
Back to the bar, toast to the night
She close to my side, I’m approachin’ her right
2 o’clock and I’m ready for a nightcap
Layin’ up in my lap, askin’ if I like that
