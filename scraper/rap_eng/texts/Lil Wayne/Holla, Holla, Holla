Lil' Wayne talking]
Whoa, this is tha sqad

[Peanut]
Peanut flizzin' ya know
Keep drugs, pistols, and coke
Ain't no love for a bitch or a hoe
I'm not richer than most
Cause dog i ain't got shit but the flow
So don't think you can't get slugz sent to ya throat
Nigga i been tryin' to get in the door
So i be gettin' the dough
Catch me gettin' bent at the stove
Dog, i'm Mazant if u didn't know
We bring chickens cross the road
And that ain't no joke

[Raw Dizzy]
Dirty, i'm dizzy
Bitch, ain't no mo'
Rich in parts
So i can't go broke
Can't no flo'
Ain't no flo'
My name on Yo
I ain't no hoe
Get ya man
Fo' i paint ya flo'
You stupid if you think the sqad ain't gone flow
Gotta keep holdin' my jeans cause they hang so low
Yall might think yall
But ain't gone know
Until i cock back and pull at Yo
And let go

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Yall gone hate me / cause i got my own shit
Yall gone make me / Run and get my chrome shit
S-Q-A-D till the day i'm gone bitch
You ain't sqad up
You can holla, holla, holla

[Young Yo]
Eazy baby
Recognize game
You check ya hoe phone u might see the same name
And if u see dust
Thatz me switchin' lanes
And if u look hard
U can see me gettin' brain
And if u see a Bentley
That might be my brother Wayne

[Lil' Wayne]
I'm lil'weezy
Fo' sheezy
I'm off the heezy
Believe me

[Young Yo]
Peep me
I take this pimp shit deeply
Done seen to many pretty hoes suck me
To let a ugly to hoe eat me

[J-Gutter]
He be J-Gudda
Jive fukaz
Stay away from a young sqad upper
Move inside for the mob
Cause the sqad comin'
I'm probably thuggin'
In the eyes of the public
Wit slanted eyes on the buggy
And damnit i will ride or die for it
I'm front line
U try and front
And u will die tryin'
U see the front shine fine
Recognize i'm young money until the end of my time

[Lil' Wayne]
Time up

Wit some monster feet

[Young Yo]

[Young Yo]

Tryin' to get my feet on land

[Chorus x 2: Lil' Wayne]
