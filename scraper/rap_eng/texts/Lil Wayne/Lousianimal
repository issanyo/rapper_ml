Lousianimal, I'm an animal..
I'm a beast, I'm a dog..
Lousianimal, I'm an animal..
(I Got emmm)

Call me Lil Weezy and the Carter
I go harder
All about a dolla
Fuck two quaters
Bitch i pour syrup in that vitamin water
I hope you die ugly and tonight be georgous
Feed me your organs
Bitch im starving
Tear drops on my face like its my party
And if its my party, i can cry if i want to
Split your fucking body up in half like 1-2
Bitch im from New Orleans
Reportin everywhere
And i have a dream to be your worst nightmare
I'm in the Kings chair
Watching Sportscenter

And I cut on BET, Eye dinner
Throw your ass up
Yeah we taking over
And we hungry so please come with a chip on your shoulder
And we got dem guns that gotta sit on your shoulder
I rock Ice but my heart colder

Lousianimal, I'm an Animal
