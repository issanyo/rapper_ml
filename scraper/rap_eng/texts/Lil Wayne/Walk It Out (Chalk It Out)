Drought 3
Look
I bought it out like stunna
I hope when we kiss we make u sick to yo stomach
Stunning like my daddy
And yo momma eat rubbers
I bet dat i can do da mouf 2 mouf with yo women
My house is a dungen
Yellow diamond ring lookin like a little funion
Stand on my toes you can call me Paul Bunjion
Touchin up my flows like a nigga do construction
Da microfone wet cuz my words like seduction
N when we on the jet you dnt come up on da discution
And if you say you ballin we prolly dnt trust ya
I not no plan on freakin hoes dat prolly dnt fuck ya
Even if you pay em boy they prolly won't fuck ya
Only if i say dat she can touch ya like busta
But she might touch ya
And burn ya like usher
Me n my click we in red like blush
I shit this rappers out and sometimes i 4get 2 flush ya
Grand daddy purp or bubble kush crush ya
Explode in a bitch mouf like a gusher
Cash money young money
Check da production
I am just a martion
Get prepared for obduction
Haha

Haha
