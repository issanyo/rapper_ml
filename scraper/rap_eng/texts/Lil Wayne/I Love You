[Intro - Keyshia Cole]

When I found out that you were leaving me
I couldn't sleep thinking about
All the things that we been through
Now all that I want to do is tell you
That I love you so much
You know I really really miss you

[Hook - Keyshia Cole]

All these sweet memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you, I love you
All these sweet memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you, I love you

[Verse 1 : Lil Wayne]
I be blowing up the bombest green
Make me step into that tom machine*
Let's step into that time machine
Tell you what I've seen
Tell you where I been
And every day I dream about
How it seem like everyday was February 14
Cupid on beam, that arrow's sting
We were more than a fling
We were more like a ring
On ya left hand, tuxedo best man
The flower girl was supposed to be our girl
You was supposed to have the bridal and the baby shower girl
Young Carter, Young Keysh
Yea this our world
The new queen, now make Mary prouder girl

[Hook - Keyshia Cole]
All these sweet memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you, I love you
All these sweet memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you, I love you

[Verse 2 : Lil Wayne]
As I blow stink back, I just think back
About the time I wish I could bring back
Man, I'm doing a buck down memory lane
And if I crash just pick up my plane
Cause I'm talking about we go way back, we go far back
Before pain guzzler was called jack
Well now it's back to the future, star track
Exit memory lane, now where can I park at?
Pardon me, I just thought back
Bout how I used to fuck you and you fought back
Dem late night bed fights neck bites leg bites
Some times handcuffs, but never read rights
And now it's never red lights
Down that memory lane, I know
So I guess that green light means I go
Through the fire thinking bout all the flames I know
Yeah, but you know

[Chorus - Keyshia Cole]
I wish that you change your ways soon enough
So we can be together
You just don't understand good love
And now all we have is memories

[Verse 3 : Keyshia Cole & Lil Wayne)
And I'm like what did I do? What did I do?
Whatever it is can I undo?
You know I got stand for my 1-2
But my 1-2 is nothing without you
What can I do? What can I do?
Whatever it is can I do it for you?
Whatever it is can I do it forever?
For the record every time I hear this record I'm like

[Hook - Keyshia Cole]
All these sweet memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you, I love you
All these sweet memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you, I love you


[Outro - Keyshia Cole]
So now when I think back on the times
That you shared with me baby
No one could ever compare
To the love you, (to the love you)
That you brought to me baby
So why did you have to go away?
I miss you so (I miss you so)
But I'm sure you know, that I have all these sweet memories

[Hook : Keyshia Cole]
All these sweet memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you, I love you
