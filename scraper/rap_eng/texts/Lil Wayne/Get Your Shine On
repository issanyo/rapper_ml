[Baby]
Yeah
We gon' go old school
You know what I'm saying?
If you from where I'm from, you know what I'm talking bout
The way we do this here
This is a cash money classic
And I feel couldn't nobody do it the way I'ma do it
Ya know what I'm saying?
So, here we go world
I'm bringing it to your world from my world
You know what I'm talking bout?
Look, I say

[Hook x2: Baby]
Get your shine on (x3)
So nigga stop hating
Get your shine on (x3)
You know we gonna make it

[Verse 1: Baby]
In one you trust, the neighborhood is us
And everything that I ride is 22's and up
And every time that I slide, you know I'm platinum plus
Make the hood understand that we trying to come up
24's on trucks, just the neighborhood lust
Tell Lil' One be cool everybody coming up
Cause everybody wanna ride, everybody wanna shine
So how ya love that people? Everybody on the grind
And these projects cuts ya, ya hood rich living lavish
Louis the 14th, you know we had to have it
Once upon a time it was nothing but madness
Hustling right in front of my mama, Ms. Gladys
Chasing paper paper chasing, look that's all we know
Coming through the neighborhood on them 24's
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand, nigga up it some more
Fast money, Cash Money, that's all I know
One

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
They say I walk around like I got an S on my chest
That be that Cash Money Piece, flow rest 'em to death
I'm a specialist Vet, No testin the best
Be in class, no pencil, no test on the desk
I'll make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
I'm from the south streets of beast like Lil' Weezy
F baby for the team I rep daily
I come to the defense like Champ Bailey, I'm gone wit it
A chrome kitted, a foam pit in the back of it
Phony titty bitches come home with me, get the business
I made bling-bling, I'm like a lighthouse
So tuck that ice in, cause y'an ain't iced out
Pay attention closely, you niggas can never roast me
Cause the maker of the Testarossa knows me
Oh hes so arrogant, the cocky kind
But you always looking cause I'ma shine
That's right

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Baby]
Loud mics and big rims, nigga, that's my life
Come through the neighborhood with my homeboy price
Lets get it understood, nigga, that's my price
Come through the neck of the woods, you be alright
Cause I'm pimping, I'm pimping pimping, I'm coming through
And I'm dipping, I'm dipping dipping, them 22's
And they spinning, they spinning spinning, them Sprewells, nigga
Them Sprewells nigga, we making mail nigga
Don't need no introduction in this
I can grind in every ghetto, trying to stay hood rich
You can ask a nigga bout me, you know I'm bout my shit
I was made by guerrillas, raised the hot boy click
Cause I'm the Birdman and I'll do you something bad
You heard man that I been slanging them slacks
That's my word man, I won't stunt nigga
I won't stunt nigga, I'm gonna stunt nigga, One

[Hook]
