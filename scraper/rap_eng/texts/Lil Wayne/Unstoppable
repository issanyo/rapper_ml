[Chorus Repeat x2:]
You can talk all you want
But my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd
And my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable

Save your pity for tomorrow
When I smash it like a ball
In the club
On the news
I'll be rocking like a rock star
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Weezy F baby
Hello girl
I got a black resident in a yellow cab
In my red shoes and my swags
So sick
I need a cesspool

I'm never in a bad mood
But I can make her bed move
You like my attitude
Ain't nobody else on my magnitude
See ain't nothing stopping me
I feel like ain't nothing after me
Huh, whatcha talking about kat?
I ran in a bank
And I walked out set
Yeah
And I walk it like I talk
But I run this shit
Yeah, run it like a faucet
I'm on the A list
'Cause I'm all Young Money

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Now shake your body like you got the jungle fever
Rushing through your veins
We getting crazy
And the club is banging through your brain
When I say jump, you jump
Jump is knocking, knocking
I wanna see you jump
Like this beat is rocking

Love bite on my bracelet
Kinda fancy but it's hot
You wanna come along
And see and holler at me

Maybe I lost it
Maybe not 'cause I got game
Like a burning flame
Yeah, that's me
Uh, huh

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge Repeat x4:]
Fa, fa, fa, fa
Follow the leader

[Repeat Chorus:]
