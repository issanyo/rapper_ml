[Hook: Future]

Hit the club with my niggas, and we spend some
Bands in the air, make them hoes spaz out
10 bad bitches, can't pick one
This one yellow, this one redbone
They all feign, they wanna get faded off that lean
Gettin money, but we stay clean
Broke niggas, they wanna scheme
Fuck niggas, they wanna scheme
Gold diggers, they wanna scheme
Broke niggas, they wanna scheme

[Verse 1: KG]

Aye, it's KG
A muthafuckin OG, all the hoes they know me
Got my kit when I was thirteen, YMCMB my team
Cash Money, we know bout that money
Puffin on OG, call that Puff Daddy
Hit up the club the club stuntin like my nigga Weezy's daddy
Grew up without my daddy, all these bitches and I can't find molly
Shawty a redbone, so she give me redwood
I call that Hollywood, I wish a nigga would
Comin staright out the hood, no time for faggots
It's KG, hoes stick to my dick like maggots
Got a beat from Mustard, nigga catch up
Mom couldn't pay the rent, now we up
Like Kendrick, I dive in that pussy like Kendrick
Nigga look at my pendant, crusin' in the Rari
My life, it's the life of the party
Ciroc and champagne, KG that's my name

Hit the club with my niggas, and we spend some
Bands in the air, make them hoes spaz out
10 bad bitches, can't pick one
This one yellow, this one redbone
They all feign, they wanna get faded off that lean
Gettin money, but we stay clean
Broke niggas, they wanna scheme
Fuck niggas, they wanna scheme
Gold diggers, they wanna scheme
Broke niggas, they wanna scheme

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

Stick to the G-Code, me and my niggas sippin' on codeine
That pussy, I make it stretch like a limosuine
Gettin' dirty, servin' to these fiends
You bitch met me, now she a feign
It's LIl' Wayne, but my dick B.I.G
Worth over a century, but I can't afford to pay attention to these niggas
They shook ones, I need suspension for these niggas
Y'all snitches, shouldn't even mention these niggas
Weezy F Baby and the F is for fuck you
I'll make you go broke like Young Buck, don't make me buck you
Tunechi, now that bitch outta tune
I'll fuck anywhere, I don't need a room
I'mma sweep y'all niggas, who got the broom
Bitch I'm raw like I don't use rubbers
She a bad bitch, so I don't use rubbers
FBI after me, they got fuck niggas undercover

[Bridge: KG]

All my life I've hustled, rap game another hustle
Got a flock of hoes, no I don't trust em'
Broke niggas, they wanna scheme
Staright outta Miami, everyday I see my dreams

Fuck niggas, they wanna scheme
Gold diggers, they wanna scheme
