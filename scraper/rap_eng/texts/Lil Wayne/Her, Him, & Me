[Lil Wayne Intro:]
What's up
It's me
Yep, uhm
I've had plenty episodes with various women, but it's just this one I must tell you about...

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I met her in Victoria's
She was hotter than a crown victoria
On my block on a friday at 6:00 yep
I was on her yung joc
She made me lean and rock
I tried to tell her my name but laughed more so
Because she looked like tell me somethin I don't kno
So I told her my number and I got hers also
And of course she knew I had a girl, I wouldn't be in the store
So we hooked up that morning like around 4
And at that time I knew what she was down for
Yep
Soon as the door opened, war opened out
She was such a soldier, purple heart pokin out of her fatigues, and she's never fatigued
And with her, whatever I say she believes
And my girl know I got a magic show up my sleeve
But with her, I can disappear when I need
And she say...

[Hook]
She don't even care about my girlfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with me
And who am I to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should I be
Shit
And she don't even wanna be my girlfriend
She said she just wanna do her thang with me
And she gonna do her thang with me, with me


[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
(let me tell you bout this bitch I got tho)
I met this bad bitch last month
Bona fide freak, we been kickin it for the past month
Or should I say I been hittin it for the past month
David blaine, magic stickin it for the last month
She got that coke bottle ill shape
Thicker than a McDonald's milkshake
We don't go on dates, we have field days
She let me play on her field like a bill's game
And she don't even like football, she just sits home
But she love it when I run it in her inzone
She love to role play and put them wigs on
Yeah, she be gettin her lil' kim on
With me, she can be as freaky as she is, but with him she gotta be as sneaky as she is
And with her, I can be as kinky as I'm gonna be
Upside down, handstand's how I wanna be
She said...

[Hook:]
She don't even care about her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with a g
And who is he to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should he be
Shit
And she don't want him to be her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do her thang with a g
And she gonna do her thang with a g, with a g
