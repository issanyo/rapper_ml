[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Ok now shorty had yellow
Shorty eyes brown
Shorty so gold
And so is my crown
Baby color me red
Shorty code red
And so is my flag
Purple in my bag
And shorty hair black
And so is that card
That I got in my bag
How could I go Hard from my girl in fact
I could take a ball from the world
Since the president black
I went and bought a black pearls
Like damn
And she gonna wanna see lil wayne go
She just wanna bonnafie lil wayne boe
Now or later cause me and her gonna create art together
Ohhhh
She wanna do it has we do it all night
I never blew it hurt my lung

See the wall black and I dress all white

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar]
Mama says she love it when I'm color coordinated
So I pull up in a maroon coupe with maroon laces
In my Supras I maneuver like
MacGyver when it's time to ride
Say she always feeling blue
When he telling white lies
Rain on her window pain
All she see is grey skies
Told her hit this purple
Maybe this will ease your mind
I'm rocking purple lable
Check out my shirt design
Perfect with her purple kisses
Slack track number eight
From The Dream maybe this is something you ain't neva see
Put you in a real world
Take you out that green screen
Sippin on pink panties
In the stretched limousine
They takin off pink panties
When we hit the room please
Don't confuse me for no murderer like Norman Bates
But I'm about to kill it
Pull out the yellow tape
I'm guessing I'm a criminal
You caught up in my web
Like a brown recluse
K. Dot is a color never seen boo

[Verse 3 - Jay Rock]
She love it when I'm flamed up
Valet park the Red Lamborghini at the Grand Lux
Grammys with the red tux
She a red bone
Red manicure
Red hair
Think I like her
Might wife her in some red airs
Walk her up my red stairs
Headed to the red room
She gone yell code red once I jump in that womb
Red diamonds on my wrist, red diamonds on my neck
Give yo' ass a blood bath, if you ever disrespect
Red lobster, you a small fish walking thru my set
Red beam, I'm aiming from the roof of my projects
She know that I'm gangster, she read that I'm a prospect
Eatin' red beans, shittin' on em, "Where the flys at?"
Red in my pupils and that's just from the contact
She wanna blow up I'm a show her where that bomb at
So baby ride with the red flow
Her face turned red soon as I said let's go

[Outro - Lil Wayne]
Yea Ohhh

Ohhhhhhh Yeahhhhh
Ohhhhhhh Ohhhh Ehhhhhh
Hahaha That's right baby
I'm gone
