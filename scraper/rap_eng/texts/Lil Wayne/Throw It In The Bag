[Hook]
She all on me cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentley coupes
Got no needs, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop

[Verse 1]
Swimming in Polo, sleeping in Jordans
I bought her cell phone and I don’t even much call it
New imports make her feel important
No bullshit, nigga, no Ben Gordon
Get her information, take her on vacation
Give her dope dick, now she under the sedation
Wake her in the morning, breakfast where she slept at
Tell her go shopping, I can't wait til she get back
Louis flip-flops and a pair of pink sweat pants
She wear that on my jet, I fuck her after jet lag
I take her to the vet cause she a bad bitch
You can't be broke and happy, so me, I'm madd rich
I'm talking Young Money shit, she love the way I think
L’Oreal all over my bathroom sink
Betsey Johnson all over my bedroom counter
My pockets too deep, I fuck around and drown her

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fucking on Versace, napping on satin
I love to hit it backwards: call it pig latin
I bought her ass a Mac, now we be iChattin
Nigga swag-jackin', but I got my patent
Fresh out the salon, I took her to Milan
I speak a little French and her's is no better then mine
I pass her the blunt, she probably hit it one time
Catch us at the game sitting on the baseline
We can call a timeout, take a lil time out
Pockets too deep, shorty, you gonna have to climb out
Faviana prom dress with your spine out
And I live on the beach, you can get that panty line out
She wants to own me and I ain't trying to fight it
She said it's her dick, she got it copyrighted
And I don't pay for pussy because her pussy's priceless
I go fishing in it, and I ain’t a Pisces
Gucci only to the grocery store
Stop playing, bitch, you balling like Okafor
And now we headed to the dealer
I'm going to cop my baby something with no ceilings
