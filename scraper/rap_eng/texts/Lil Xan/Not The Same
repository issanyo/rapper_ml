[Intro]
Ay
Prrrra-
Life's just not the same, yeah, ay
Life's just not the same
Kinfolk Jon

[Chorus]
Life's just not the same, yeah, ay
Girls don't act the same, yeah, ay
I really hate the fame, yeah
I said I really hate the fame, yeah, ay, yeah, ay

[Verse]
I'm stuck in outer-space
My heart feel outta place
My body outta shape
My home feel outta place
I fucked them old [?]
I know you made some new ones
I started making demons
And triple-6 my team shit
Xanarchy or ecstacy, yeah
I'm the president, yeah (prra)
And when I put a bullet in my head
It's straight to heaven bitch

[Chorus]
Life's just not the same
Girls don't act the same
I really hate the fame
I really hate the fame
And life's just not the same
And girls don't act the same
I really hate the fame
I really hate the fame

[Outro]
Out the booth
Xanarchy

[Spoken Word]
As far as what, like, people change?
Everybody changes, you know what I mean?
Ask any rapper, man, you start getting a little bit of fame, money, people start acting different
I-we've had to cut half of the people we used to fuck with off because they became weirdos, or they expected some shit from us
It's like a bitter-sweet thing with this rap shit
