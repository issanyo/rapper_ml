Yeah, haha

[Verse 1: Skooly]
Too much cash, too much swag, I got plenty hoes
She got ass, she got ass, they some friendly hoes
And she bad, and she bad, and her friend a hoe
And her man can't get mad cos' she wit' it doe'
Tell her blindfold, she's a centerfold
Them some diddy hoe, they drink Henny hoe
Go to college and they pop it, they're too many hoe
You know them city hoes, well not really though
Out the city, eat at Venice, stay by lenience hoes
Let me finish though, want 'bout 10 a show
I got plenty shows, I got plenty hoes
Hot as stove, whip the floor up like a bene bowl

Ooh, okay, go and hate, but I'm still gon' stay
