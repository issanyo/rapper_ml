[Intro: Lil Xan]
(I don't want your bitch, but she on her way)
(I don't want your bitch, but she on her way)
Bitch I'm off 13 xans
(I don't want your bitch, but she on her way)
And a half a perc (yeah, fuck it)
(She on her way)

[Verse 1: Lil Xan]
Yuh, they said I wouldn't be shit
Lil Xan I'm the fuckin' man
$teven Cannon, Steven said I wouldn't ever be shit
Lil Xan I'm the fuckin' man
Yo, fuck them motherfuckers I ain't even wanna dance, man
Wear snapbacks and they still wear a t-shirt
Like, Steven said back in his song
Man, remember that shit, that was raw
Like fuck, aye, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, aye yuh
I got problems with all my bitches (why?)
My bitch know about my bitch
And my bitch know about my bitch, aye, yuh
Black xans all in my bape drawer, aye
Y'all don't wanna take those
I ain't even take
Bape shorts, hide the Glock 40 with it
You ain't get the job, you ain't with the
(Pop, pop, pop, pop, bang now)
Need a Lamborghini, have a orgy in it
Your bitch in a bikini, how bout that I hit it

[Verse 2: $teven Cannon]
Take two niggas just to tango
Whip the color of a mango
Chain is little but it hang low
Diamonds lookin' like a rainbow
Scuba Steve like the swimmin' thots
Headache punch get you in the dots
Sittin' long, dippin' from the cops
I'm poppa bear, my wifey goldielocks
Baddie mortgage and he's goddamn jealous (he jealous)
Your bitch is weak, she rockin' Perry Ellis
Plug got the glass, I call her Cinderella (Cinderella)
Need Rihanna, she need an umbrella (la la la)
Stupid ass bitches wanna know my name
I pull up and go skrrt skrrt, I script the plane
These niggas don't know, I'm with them game
Bitches play ps2, I ain't with them lanes, yuh

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I don't want your bitch, but she on her way
I don't want your bitch, but she on her way
I don't want your bitch, but she on her way, aye
She love me, she everyday
I don't want your bitch, but she on her way
Playin' with my balls like, yeah, uh
I don't want your bitch, but she on her way
I don't want your bitch, but she on her way

[Outro: Lil Xan]
