[Verse 1: Lil Xan]
I don't feel so well
Hand around my pill
She don't pop these pills
I just pop these pills
Hand around a pill
Xan might try this pill
All we pop is pills
All she pop is pills
I don't feel so well
I don't feel so well
Man, she don't look that great
Man, she don't pop a pill
I'dda pop a pill
I can't even feel
Man, she don't look so well
Man, she don't look so well
All these wishing wells
Wish upon that well
Look up to the sky, to the stars and beyond
She don't want them pills
She with me cuttin' pills
But my name Lil Xan so she think I got them pills
I whip that Audi for an hour just to get a fucking thrill
I fuck that bitch all night cuz' all she do is thrill
I fuck that bitch all night, all she wanna do is thrill
I pop that pill, pill, pill
I pop that pill, pill, pill

[Verse 2: $teven Cannon]
I can't do nowells
I got clientele
It look a little short, don't care if i gotta steal
My wrist a wishing well
My diamonds looking clear (aye)
Yea, I stay with pills
Got your girlfriend copping pills (aye)
Finessing for these deals
I bet you wish you did
I focus on these mills
Ain't no worry bout a bitch
Ain't no fame when people switch
Work move like a gift
Your hairline do the splits
I hear your boyfriend broke as shit (aye)
I might just steal a whip
Already stole your bitch (aye)
But you can have your bitch cause' that bitch got crusty lips (aye)
I roll right through the six
Work right through the six (aye)
I might just steal a whip
Yo' bitch got crusty lips
