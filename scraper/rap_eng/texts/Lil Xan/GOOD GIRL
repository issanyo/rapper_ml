Always been a good sport, yeah
Never good at playing sports, yeah
At my autopsy
I hope I'm wearing gold teeth
And some new ripped jeans
(And some new ripped jeans)
At my autopsy I hope I'm wearing gold teeth and some new ripped jeans (new ripped jeans)
I'm ahead of my time
Y'all just catching my vibe
And the radio pop old
So I just left it behind
I think it's over
I don't even know the time of day
Hate when it rains, ain't no shine today
Hate when it rains, ain't no shine today
All these drugs that I do
I'ma be blind one day
All these drugs that I do
I'ma be blind one day

[Chorus]
You seem like a good girl, yeah
You seem like a good girl, yeah
You seem like a good girl, yeah
You seem like a good girl, yeah

[Verse 2]

Always been a good sport, yeah
Never good at playing sports, yeah
