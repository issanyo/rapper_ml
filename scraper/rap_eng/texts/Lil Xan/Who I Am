[Chorus]
Xans don't make me what I am
Xans gon' mess up all my friends
Fans go nuts when we jump in
Xans don't make me who I am
Xans don't make me what I am

[Verse 1]
Whippin', whippin'
The foreign just so vicious
Listen, listen
These hoes just want your mansion
Trippin', trippin'
On all the stupid issues
Tissues, tissues
I swear that I don't miss you
Guns don't shine when you're not by
The only friend I have is time
The only friend I had just died

[Chorus]
Xans don't make me what I am
Xans gon' mess up all my friends
Fans go nuts when we jump in
These Xans don't make me who I am

[Verse 2]
Yeah September be the best month
That's the month I came from
April be the worst month
That's the month my heart broke
That's the time my life froze
Life needed a life source
That's the time my heart broke
That's the time my life broke
Darkest cause my darkest days
Please just give me one more day
Promise I'mma make it last
Hope it just don't fly right past
Out here fuckin' bitches though like
Who are you? who are you?
Hate the way that we're just measured by our views
Rollie pollie ollie
Dunkin' bitches like I'm Kobe
Need a boost, I need my script yeah
Never leave the crib yeah
I'mma gang bang on your bitch
She gon' call you up and say she late yeah
'Cause she rode my face yeah
Roll it that's the snake eyes
Lame hoes catch the fade right
I'mma make it right quick
I'mma fight a dyke bitch
I'mma catch this flight bitch
Delta can just suck my dick
Pigtails are the cutest things
Little Xan like finer things
Love my girl she ridin' things
'Cedes whip, I'm whippin' past
Do 150 on the dash
Kill it like it's nothin' bruh
You stay in a Acura
Why you out here actin' up?
Suck me like you Dracula
Fuck it I don't give a fuck
Sluts always get up for-

[Chorus]
Xans don't make me what I am
Xans gon' mess up all my friends
Fans go nuts when we jump in
Xans don't make me who I am
Xans don't make me what I am
Xans don't make me what I am
Xans gon' mess up all my friends
Fans go nuts when we jump in
Xans don't make me who I am
