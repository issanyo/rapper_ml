Been bout this shit since '96, about you fuckin' up

Adolescent kid I'm tryna rep, I'm tryna go to school
But that didn't work for me so I left, fuck the faculty
Been bout this shit since '96, about you fuckin' up
Been bout this shit since I was a little man I thought you know
Adolescent kid I'm tryna rep, I'm tryna go to school
But that didn't work for me so I left, fuck the faculty

Take a trip to Zanzibar off the bar, couple bars, cup o' hard, ooh
Couple bitches, give 'em hard, ooh, get me hard like what?
