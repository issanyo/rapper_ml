[Verse 1: Lil Xan]
Throw my evening up, when it's rough
I shall tuck, you're the [?] rolling, adding up
Can't control myself, fucking bitches
I did well, [?] outta place
Outer space, or out of state
Got a foreign licence plate
Ayy, yuh

[Verse 2: Lil Xan]
It don't matter Imma get it how I want it
200 [?], son we be talking bass
Ring-a-round a rosie, I might suck on Ronda Rousey
They keep talking all about me
They don't know me, they so funny, yeah
Yo, what's the word, what's the deal
I've been super well, yeah

[Bridge: Lil Xan]
Can't you see, can't you tell, ay, yuh, ay (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
[?] cigar, took some piss, the day I joined the rapping biz
Tomorrow I might fuck your bitch
And leave some xanax on her lips
Tomorrow I might fuck your bitch
And leave some xanax on her lips

[Verse 3: Chem X]
Fucking on your bitch, take a xan and then I dip
Take a line, and Goddam drip
Sold her car and got the whip
Several bullets in my clip
Pour a xan and watch me sip
Talk to [?], I'm 'bout to flip
Write a foreign hidden list

[Verse 4: Chem X]
Worried by the doc that there's smoke in my lungs
[?] little boy never seen no guns
Swerve 'round the Devil, I'm speaking in tongues
Your time is over, you losing we won
Taking all these pills, I just do this shit for fun
Dosing under morphine, and I'm getting fucking numb
If I'm coming for you, bitch you better fucking run
I'm a hit you with the blade, if you ever acting dumb
