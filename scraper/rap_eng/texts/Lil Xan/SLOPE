[Intro]
You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat
Yeah, Aye

[Verse 1]
Send a text to my Ex
Blame it on the xanax
Little guy, still flex
No chain, no strap
Put her face in the pillow I'ma go
Super Saiyan, Bitch what the fuck is you sayin’
I'ma beast, I'ma ghost
I fuck bitches I fuck hoes
Women love to cum a lot so I just fuck and rock though
Gracie baby don’t you lie you know you love my tongue though
I just pulled up to my old high school in my G-Wagon
That bitch said I wouldn't be shit now she be braggin'
Fuck that bitch inside the hallway yeah
That when I was seventeen yeah, aye

[Chorus]
Fuck that hoe, fuck that hoe
Yeah I wanna fuck that hoe
Fuck that hoe, fuck that hoe
Yeah I wanna fuck that hoe
Fuck that hoe, fuck that hoe
Yeah I wanna fuck that hoe
Fuck that hoe, fuck that hoe
Yeah I wanna fuck that hoe (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yes we respect the women but the uber right outside
Close out the eye
You know It's nighty-night for you and I
I feel like the devil in disguise
I fly get high like the sky
I feel like the devil in disguise
I fly high right in the sky

[Chorus]
Fuck that hoe, fuck that hoe
Yeah I wanna fuck that hoe
Fuck that hoe, fuck that hoe
Yeah I might just fuck that hoe
Yeah I wanna fuck that hoe
Fuck that hoe, fuck that hoe
Fuck that hoe, fuck that hoe
Yeah I might just fuck that hoe

[Outro]
Xanarchy Baby
