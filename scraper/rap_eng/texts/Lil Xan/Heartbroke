[Verse 1]
Doing 150 up on the dash
Swerving that car like I wanna crash
Schooling these lames like I was they dad
Fucking they mom, now they momma mad
Fucking they daughter cause she was bad
Hopped in the lane, when I'm switching the lane
All of these bitches they fuck with lames
Why all these bitches they fuck with lames?

Heartbroke, life stuck
Heartbreak, toothache

Fuck lean, fuck drugs
Bipolar, fuck love
Heartbroke, life stuck
Heartbreak, toothache

[Verse 2]
I like they way that it beam
Pulled a red dot Imma murder the scene
Pull out the whistle like I'm referee
Call up the chopper don't run up on me
Xanarchy gang we goin' murder the scene
All of my diamonds they glisten like rain
(They glisten, they glisten, they glisten)
Put gold all in my wisdom teeth
I ash my blunt on bitches teeth
Giving bitches bloody nose
I'm not the type to sock a ho
Lil Xan the shit yeah
It's been established since '96
Yeah '96 been about my shit
Yeah '96 been about my shit
