Yuh, aye, yuh, aye
Yuh, aye, yuh, aye
BVB

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles

I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles

I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles

I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles

[Verse: Lil Xan]
Rollie so gold on my wrist, yeah
Why even try, you a bitch
I got too many to count, aye
Weed got me stuck on the couch, aye
Xans got me sad Imma pout, aye, yuh
Parents dont like me oh well

Hit me for xans I got deals, aye, yuh

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles

I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles

I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles

I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles

[Verse: $teven Cannon]
She just wanna fuck Big Steve
She a captain with the D's
Baby payin' all the fees
Then she droppin' to her knees
Boof boy in the backyard
Put dick in her when she act up
I hate a nigga tryna act hard
You would shoot the gun while you back up
Stovetop at 400, aye
Got the hoes on me, whole onion
Whip and (?) it's a cold summer
Pink tank and thats a whole hummer
Need this shit like a AK
Shit on time it ain't a day late
Kill a nigga for a payday
You one wishin' like you Ray Jay

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles

I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles

I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles

I need to string like a banjo
I leave from trap like a temple
Need to call me up a bad hoe
I ain't got time for no battles
