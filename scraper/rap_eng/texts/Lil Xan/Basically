[Intro]
Yeah, aye, what, aye, um
(You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat)
Yeah, yeah, aye, yeah

[Verse 1]
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
How the fuck I end up with a basic bitch?
Basic bitch, basically, she just wanna fuck 'cause I am up
And not to be rude, but I think you’re a slut
But that's okay though, I don't care hoe
You a star but can’t seem to shine though
You a star but can’t seem to shine though

[Chorus]
Nights got longer
Days seem darker
Friends seem so distant
I might just go missin'
Nights got longer
Days seem darker
Friends seem distant
I might just go missin'

[Verse 2]
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
In the limelight, I can't even hide right
Took the high road, ain’t it low though
On my face, I got tatted logos
You don't own me
All y'all phony
I'm just saying you could do it better
Like Xanarchy, yeah I did it better
I'm so cold, I think I need a sweater
Like cold weather, yeah, the better weather
Heartbroke since like last September
Like, oh, yeah, aye, last September, since aye yeah

[Chorus]
Nights got longer
Days seem darker
Friends seem so distant
I might just go missin'
Nights got longer
Days seem darker
Friends seem distant
I might just go missin'
Aye yeah
Nights got longer
Days seem darker
Friends seem so distant
I might just go missin'
Nights got longer
Days seem darker
Friends seem distant
I might just go missin'

[Outro]
Xanarchy
