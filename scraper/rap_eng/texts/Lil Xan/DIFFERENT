[Intro]
Yeah!
I'm back from the fuckin' mountains bitch
Shout out to [?] haha

[Chorus]
So much red up on my body like I'm Clifford
People only fucking hate me cause I'm different
So much red up on my body like I'm Clifford
People only fucking hate me cause I'm different

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so motherfuckin' different
Yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy, yeah
I'm so motherfuckin' different

Pull up in my Wagon with the windows tinted
Got a couple hoes but they ain't with it
Got a couple hoes but they ain't with it

[Interlude]
Yeah, ayy
Man they're all saying
Lil Xan's so clueless, I'm the worst rapper

But you know, it's okay
You know it's all good

[Chorus]
So much red up on my body like I'm Clifford
People only fucking hate me cause I'm different
So much red up on my body like I'm Clifford
People only fucking hate me cause I'm different

I'm so motherfuckin' different
