[Intro: $teven Cannon]
Dolla!
Ye-uhm-hum....

[Verse 1: $teven Cannon]
I dropped a Xan in my orange juice
My ex hit me on my trap phone
I'm in the hills with the semi cocked
About the paper like my facts wrong
I mix the orange with the Hi-C
Smile at my face but they don't like me
I shoot the [?]
Is you Xanned? Bitch I might be
Bitch I might be

[Hook: $teven Cannon]
I got Xans, I got Xans
I'm the Xan man
All you need to take is one
And you gon wanna pay a band
I'm in the car with my niggas
Break and count a couple bricks
I don't even talk to niggas
But I got a couple bitches
I got Xans, I got Xans
I'm the Xan man
All you need to take is one
And you gon wanna pay a band
I'm in the car with my niggas
Break and count a couple bricks
I don't even talk to niggas
But I got a couple bitches

[Verse 2: LUCKI]
Ayy, ayy, ayy

I got envisions, got a vision, got a bitch too
That bitch is gonna get it done if I'm scared to
She show you pussy, you ain't focused, where your shit, fool?
My mans'll do some extra weight for a tip too
Tell a hoe pause on it
Focus on the D body, that's just 1 pill
[?], this is my thrill
This like that dream you told me 'bout
Your bitch want 1 pill, plus 1 pill, plus 1 pill
Fuck how them scud feel

I mean I'm try'na to feel 'em
I can't do, I'm numb still
I go with you talkin'
You lucky I can comprehension and took all the Xan
Wait, how the fuck you get in here?

Them seducin' ass', cute honey, cute honey
Guess what though? My dude's a try two honey's
And it's hot as fuck, my vision just was too blurry

[Hook: $teven Cannon]

Double G's, gotta know about it
Bar pressin', I know about it
Two milli make a nigga silly
But I'd rather fuck around and pop a sealy
Xanax, my [?]
Percocet for my young bitch
Cocaine for my go getter
My working bitch burnin' up a zip
You fuck around and let 'em take a zip
That's 80 dollars [?]

[Verse 4: Lil Xan]
