[Intro: Connor Edwards]
I don't know how that went, probably terribly

[Hook: Connor Edwards]
Welcome to the party, we about to fuck a turkey
Welcome to the party, we about to fuck a turkey (Clears throat, aye)
Welcome to the party, we about to fuck a turkey  (Clears throat, aye)
Welcome to the party and we only getting started   (Clears throat)

[Verse 1: Connor Edwards]
Call me The Roots, I'm taking a shoots
While I'm balls-deep in a turkey
Your bitch be brute, calling me Groot
She make my dick be slurpy
I'm making her hoot, sucking my chute
Running it like she working
She on my loot, making me doot
Because your bitch be thirsty
Under a rock, she sucking my cock
Hiding it like she dirty
She coming back, spit in the crack
Because she be quirky
I hit the gag, force it back
'Cause I like to jerk it
Spit in her eye, making her cry
'Cause I live to murk shit

[Refrain: Connor Edwards]
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

[Verse 2: Connor Edwards]
Popping a molly and piling the bodies
And making me potty and sending me jolly
I spike on the holly, I'm killing your mommy
And killing the doggy 'cause I'm acting naughty
I sick on a bitch, she be taking the piss
And she wanna evict, I put gun on her clit
And she taking the pics and I force her to strip
And I'm using the pics just to make me more clips
I'm into Loli, I stealing a trolley
I killing your bitch and I taking her broccoli
Taking your babies, replacing the bodies
Hiding your family and call you Macaulay
Fuck all the click and I'm sick of the clack
I'm taking my pick and I'll have it like that
I don't care 'bout the tricks, I ain't taking no crap
I'm fucking on your mum like a nymphomaniac

[Refrain: Connor Edwards]
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye

[Bridge: Connor Edwards]
Back up out my space
You are witnessing a star
I need my breathing room
Do you not know who I are?
You got nothing on me
I'm the king of wide and far
I am Diego Leanos and
I keyed my fucking car

[Interlude: Lil Xan]
I just did this to my car
Scratched it, keyed it up, I just bought it
I just bought this fucking car
Keyed all the way, hee-yuh!

[Hook: Connor Edwards]
Welcome to the party, we about to fuck a turkey
Welcome to the party, we about to fuck a turkey
Welcome to the party, we about to fuck a turkey
Welcome to the party and we fucked the fucking turkey, yuh

[Interlude: Lil Xan]
I'm a slave to my management
I'm a slave to everybody
I don't get control of my license
I don't get control of my bank account
I don't get control of shit
I can't even drive that fucking car

[Outro: Anthony Redclift & Connor Edwards]
Fucking ouch (Laughs)
This chair's so fucking nope
(Laughs) Nigga, eat my ass, I flipped the bottle, like pussy
