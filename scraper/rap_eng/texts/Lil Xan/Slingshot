[Verse]
I like lean, I like drugs
I like beans, I got plugs
What you need? No, no funds
What you bleed? Oh, you tough
Heard my raps, they like nah
Now they ask what my price
I'm like no, outta sight
I'm like yeah, outta sight
I might stay M.I.A, I might go M.I.A
I might stay M.I.A, I might go M.I.A
Please, stay the fuck away
That's my shit, stay away
I got Low on my face
All these clothes but no Bape
I got hoe outta state
I got weed for the low
I don't pop fucking xans
I might pop a norco
We ain't with no fuck shit
We ain't 'round no fuck shit
We ain't with no fuck shit
We ain't 'round no fuck shit, fuck

[Interlude]
Nah, we ain't really 'round no fuck shit
Know I stay

[Chorus]
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit, ah
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
Fuck that shit like yuh, aye
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch like yuh, aye
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch like wha, yeah
Out the booth
