[Intro]
Rolled like, oh shit a blunt
Yo I wanna hit that, okay
Y'all got weed roll that shit up
Yeah, ayy, ayy, yeah
D-D-D-D-Diablo

[Chorus]
I do drugs on the weekend
Weekdays I'm normally sleeping
The drugs got me all tweaking
Airplane mode, always overseas yeah
I do drugs on the weekend
Weekdays I'm normally sleeping
The drugs got me all tweaking
Airplane mode, always overseas yeah

[Verse]
I think I found love in LA
Tissot's real all these girls are fake
I pop pills, take the pain away
But the pain won't go away, go away
These demons on me, yeah
In my dreams I keep running
These demons on me, yeah
In my dreams I keep running

[Chorus]
I do drugs on the weekend
Weekdays I'm normally sleeping
The drugs got me all tweaking
Airplane mode, always overseas yeah
I do drugs on the weekend
Weekdays I'm normally sleeping
The drugs got me all tweaking
Airplane mode, always overseas yeah

[Outro]
Ayy
Xanarchy
Airplane mode, always overseas yeah
