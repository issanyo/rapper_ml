[Intro]
Aye, huh

What, aye, skrrt
I crash the whip
What, what, what
What, aye
(Xanarchy)
Aye

[Chrous: Lil Xan]
I crash the whip x17

[Verse 1: Lil Xan]
I crash the whip
Off a percocet
I swerve, I hit the curb
I'm on my shit, yeah
Yeah, I'm on my shit
I pull me up before I barely take a sip
My stomach always sick
My homies lit
Aye, what, aye
I'm fucking all my homies bitches
Aye, yuh (fuckin' all my homies bitches)
And I ain't give a shit, nah
I ain't give no shit, nah
She gon' crash the whip
She hopped in then I hit, ooh
I just crash the whip
Blue diamonds look like mist
Blue blue diamonds blue like mist
Aye, I ain't hit no lick
I ain't no broke boy
I steal your bitch cause I'm a fucking hoe boy
I ain't hit no lick cause I ain't fucking broke boy
I might steal your bitch beacause you know Lil Xan a hoe boy

[Verse 2: Steven Cannon]
I crash the witch
I crash the whip
I dine and ditch
I fuckin' split
I fuck your bitch
My diamond wrist shine bright as shit
I been hittin' licks
Crew got a kick
Porsche pushin' shit
Xan hittin' shit
30 round a clip
I been punching bitches
Doing coke like stitches
Still be in the trenches
I've been with the peasants
This party hit a hundred in 3 milliseconds
Pull up with the game and fully loaded weapons
Police cannot catch me I ain't got no evidence
Niggas changing like Clark Kent
I mean my wrist deserve a raise
Aye, I really fucking wonder why these niggas do that dumb shit
I kick in your door and pull the weapon like a gunsman
Really get annoying when my bitch be on that one shit
Always drop the roof to let the diamonds see the sun shit
I need to group while I'm getting out Medusa
I just had a shawty top me while I was riding in an Uber
Aye, had a shawty top me while I was waiting on my jewler
I meet Beyonce, Shakira and Mila Kunis, ay
I crash the whip
I crash the whip
I dine and ditch
I dash and shit
I dash and shit, bitch

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I crash the whip x8

[Verse 3: Chloshawty]
(Xanarchy)
Imma switch my lane on a bitch
Get some brand new paint up on my shit
New whip, I don't rent
Prescription got me bent
We don't count up, baby, all we do is spend
