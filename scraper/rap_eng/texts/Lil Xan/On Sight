[Intro]
Welcome to the darkness

[Chorus: Lucifena]
When I pull up on ya, it's on sight
When I pull up on ya with a bright light
When I pull up on ya, it's on sight
Bright light, on sight

[Verse 1: Lucifena]
You so clear to toss it
You the type to sneak diss
That's that shit I don't fuck with
You were born bitch and you ain't lit
This liquor got me off the wall
Popped too many adderall
With my gang and we gon' ball
We don't ask cause we take it all
I better not catch you in LA
When I see you I'll run that faith
Lil Lucifena don't play
I know all the places you stay
Bringing on my 666
Bringing on my 666
Bitch I gotta rep this (?)
Bringing on my 666
Bringing on my 666
Bitch I gotta rep this (?)

[Chorus: Lucifena]
When I pull up on ya, it's on sight
When I pull up on ya with a bright light
When I pull up on ya, it's on sight
Bright light, on sight

[Verse 2: Lil Xan]
Lucifena all over this evil shit
I think I might just try not to hate crucifix
Carry people on my back
I'm sorry if I broke your back
This dick game sure I told you that
Yeah, yeah
Girls want me more, they come right back
I make 'em cum, they fiending
That want this dick like it's crack
Fuck all the hate
Blood dripping from my veins
I said fuck all the hate
Blood dripping from my veins
I said fuck all the hate yeah
I said fuck all the hate yeah
I said fuck all the hate yeah
I said fuck all the hate yeah
I said fuck all the hate
Blood dripping from my veins
I said fuck all the hate
Blood dripping from my veins
I said fuck...

[Chorus: Lucifena]
When I pull up on ya, it's on sight
When I pull up on ya with a bright light
When I pull up on ya, it's on sight
Bright light, on sight
