[Intro]
(Xanarchy)
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew
Yeah, hey, what?
Brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrrrr
What you fucking mean
Fuck it, I'm just gon' rap

[Chorus]
It's nothing (Yeah, ayy)
You drink Robitussin
Nah, that bitch ain't fucking
Told her get the fuck out 'cause I ain't cuffing
To my family all this money, yeah it mean nothin
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, I ain't fronting
Looked in the mirror, said damn I'm disgusting (bleh? what?)
No this not up for debate, no discussion (shut the fuck up)
Heartbreak, heartbreak ain't no loving

[Verse]
Ayy yeah
Love a hoe or fuck the hoe, it's up to you
Naked bitch, make the bitch come to you
I was laying with the bitch that ain't you
She gon' hate but that bitch still ain't you

[Chorus]
It's nothing (Yeah, ayy)
You drink Robitussin
Nah, that bitch ain't fucking
Told her get the fuck out 'cause I ain't cuffing
To my family all this money, yeah it mean nothin
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, I ain't fronting
Looked in the mirror, said damn I'm disgusting (what? what?)
No this not up for debate, no discussion (shut the fuck up)
Heartbreak, heartbreak ain't no loving

[Verse]
Ayy yeah
Love a hoe or fuck the hoe, it's up to you
Naked bitch, make the bitch come to you
I was laying with the bitch that ain't you
She gon' hate but that bitch still ain't you
