[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I might just run up these bands ayy
Ain't got no homies or friends
People they don't understand
People they don't understand
I might just run up these bands ayy
Ain't got no homies or friends
People they don't understand
People they don't understand

[Verse 1: $teven Cannon]
Relevantly stunting, brought the Fisker just to fool on it
Brought the katana secret compartment with the tool on it
You was a dreamer, ten out of ten you with a stupid bitch
And probably fuck herself to my pictures and a crucifix
Niggas steady [?] had an option, I been kicking shit
Niggas run their mouth about their guns and still be getting licked
[?] time to turn this rapping into business shit
Extended mag I come with sixty and you missing shit
I can't trust these niggas, they too busy on the internet
Sitting behind their Mac they can kill for this energy
I can teach your bitch, she gotta pay me just to penetrate
I got my own bitch, I had no time for dinner dates

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I might just run up these bands ayy
Ain't got no homies or friends
People they don't understand
People they don't understand
I might just run up these bands ayy
Ain't got no homies or friends
People they don't understand
People they don't understand

[Verse 2: $teven Cannon]
Whips in the back look straight up out the car show
Heavy ammunition, baby don't you check the cargo
Big bank on me, you should call me Wells Fargo
You been sleeping for a minute, I can tell you lost your marbles
Gas pedal with my whip, you could tell I hit the speedway
Yeah all my bitches naked, yeah I let 'em fuck my DJ
She hear my voice for the next week, she think I got delayed
Rest in peace Mac and shout out my nigga TreeJay
And it's a heatwave
All up in your shit with my teammates
[?] four by four I'm bout to make a nigga relay
This is for my niggas tryna make it out the PJs
Need to run them bands, I ain't no motherfucking cheapscape

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
I might just run up these bands ayy
Ain't got no homies or friends
People they don't understand
People they don't understand
I might just run up these bands ayy
Ain't got no homies or friends
People they don't understand
People they don't understand
