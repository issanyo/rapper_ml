[Verse 2]
I keep the brick then I blow it
She gave me neck and I froze it
All of my brothers is golden
Run up a sack with no limit
I just be chasing them digits
All of my diamonds is glistenin'
All of my diamonds is frigid
All of my diamonds is cold
Baby I'm so bold
My heart's stone cold
Am not from mars
I ain't talking no Bruno
She wanna kick it like judo
I'm the chosen, uno
Pulled up in the a two door
Pulled up, had two doors
I think my doors suicidal
I got these hoes on a tight rope
[?] I go nitro
Say she [?] like a cyclone
