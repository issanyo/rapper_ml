[Intro- Lil Xan]
Fuckin' barred out
What the fuck
Shit
Trappin', Trappin', aye
Yeah, aye, Yuh

[Chorus-Lil Xan]
Trappin' with bans, Trappin' with bans
I make them bans, I make them bans
I make them xans, I make them xans
I trap with bans, I trap with bans
I make them xans, aye, aye
I make them bans, aye, aye
I seen your girl, she was a fan, aye
Yo, trappin, trappin, trappin, aye yeah
Trappin', trappin', trappin', yeah, aye
Trappin,' trappin' with the bans
Trappin', trappin' in the benz
Pull up 40 with the feds
I got problems with the feds
Trappin', trappin', trappin' with the bans, aye
Trappin', trappin', trappin' with the bans, aye
I got lots of fans, aye
I got hella bans, aye
I been doing shit, aye
Thought y'all knew this shit

[Verse- $teven Cannon]
Aye yo, Trappin' I ran out of xans
Need to sign off on a benz
I could hold ice in my hands
Jiggy nigga think a nigga can dance
I don't got no rapper friends
Went up the block for some Balmain pants (?)
Ice blockin', you can't see my damn hands
Niggas lurkin' I can murk on your mans
Shawty called me for the 50 plaque blue
I ain't, she think I'm written that
Stovetop like the chimney hat
All I do is rap, Steve send me packs
I ain't gon' lie I ain't trapped in a month
Uber everywhere but I arrived in the trunk
Fishtail on the whip got scales like a bitch
Lowgang I put a rail in your bitch
Tryna go hard on my bitches like (?)
I ain't got patience, no time for a doctor
Callin' me daddy be Steve ain't her father
Car is so nice engine sing like a opera
Trappin' I ran out of xans
40/40 shoot a nigga for xans
Shawty ugly but she fuckin' my mans
Loose Cannon with my nigga Lil Xan

[Chorus-Lil Xan]
Trappin' with bans, Trappin' with bans
I make them bans, I make them bans
I make them xans, I make them xans
I trap with bans, I trap with bans
I make them xans, aye, aye
I make them bans aye, aye
I seen your girl, she was a fan

[Verse- $teven Cannon]
Aye, Trappin' I ran out of xans
Need to sign off on a benz
Trappin I ran into xans
Need to supply all the xans
Trappin' I ran out of xans
Trappin' I ran out of xans
Trappin' I ran out of xans
Need to sign off on a benz
Can't fit this band in my pants
Niggas be tweakin' off xans
They'll take more than you can, aye
How you gon' go get that lamb

[Verse- Lil Xan]
Kill that bitch I kill that bitch
All these drugs don't feel no shit
In the kitchen whippin' shit
And then I fuckin' flip your bitch

[Verse- $teven Cannon]
Black and white diamonds clan
Mazaradi missed a man with a plan
Off the Xan I couldn't even fuckin' stand
Pocket rocket leave a nigga in there layin'

[Outro- Lil Xan]
Man this dude Steven pourin' lean on his pancakes
What the fuck
