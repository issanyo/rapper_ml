[Verse 3: Yung Turk]
I want hundreds and fifties, a bitch with big titties
You dying, I'm living
My chopper is grilling
My dough to the ceiling, your ho I be stealing
Took so many xannies I don't got no feelings
I'm balling so much like I'm James
Young savage, I don't play no games
That's why I got kicked out of pre-k
Ten years old and I was taking your bae
I was a savage, I still fucking am
Fuck on your momma and fuck on your grams
Running their bases, I hit a grand slam
Don't fuck with 'rari's, I pull up in Lambs
All in her pants like she went to the beach and I'm sand
I give her that wood like I am at acamp
I give her that molly now she wanna dance
I take her to Paris, ain't talking bout France
Yung Turk, Camrn's in
We in first, they in last
Teacher said I wouldn't be shit but now look at who I am
Got the world up in my hands
All you got's a couple grams
Turning grams into Grammy's
I'm a fucking magician

[Hook: Lil Xan]
Yeah
Never been shit, never be shit
Never been shit, never be shit
Never been shit, never be shit
Never been shit, never be shit ayy
Never been shit, never be shit
Never been shit, never be shit
Never been shit, never be shit
Never been shit, never be shit ayy
Never been shit, never be shit
Never been shit, never be shit ayy
Never been shit, never be shit
Never been shit, never be shit ayy
Never been shit, never be shit
Never been shit, never be shit
Never been shit, never be shit
Never been shit, never be shit ayy
