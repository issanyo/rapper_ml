[Verse 1: $teven Cannon]
You could do anything when you look like this
So fire pull up on you with a new wife
Yeah, we gon' get it poppin' like a few Sprites, bitch
Yeah, pull up on a broad with a new white bitch
Oh no, I just jumped up out a Wraith
I never ever make the same damn mistakes
Only eatin' steak and lobster on my plates
You don't see me chillin' with no fuckin' fakes
Cos' I'm on a different level, wish you would, I know you never
I been all across the globe, trottin' Don O'-whatever
Like the whole lotta money, ima spend it on whatever
Only ice on my neck, you could get my diamonds tested

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no (prra, yeah)

[Bridge: Lil Xan]
Ooh, she so damn crazy
That's my baby
That's my baby
So damn crazy, yeah
Crazy, like
I love that bitch so, oh
Oh no, oh no, oh-

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
-no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

[Outro: Lil Xan]
Out the booth, ha, yeah
Said I'm out the booth, prra, yeah
Xanarchy
