[Verse 1: Lil Xan]
This old bitch
She roll

Rolled up in the bent
Roll up
Get your head
He's up on the shit
Load up
Get the clips
No love in this bitch
Throw it up in this bitch

Whip a boy like Bush

Just all filled up
Need love
Need home
Need fun
Need hoes
Slit throat
Kill boss
Slit wrist
Kill hoes

[Verse 2: GHOSTEMANE]
Backtrack
Grab the Mac
Put it back and grab the bat
Sipping on the Dirty Black
Splat on a bitch back
Ran up out the back to scrap
But I'm gonna dip back to the pad in my dirty white Vans, aye
Eenie meenie miney mo
I catch a thotty by her throat
Grip it till she yelling all out but don't let her go, aye
Ate a eighth
Now I'm living on another plane
Cocaine
Fucking with my brain
I'll never be the same

[Verse 3: Nick Colletti]
