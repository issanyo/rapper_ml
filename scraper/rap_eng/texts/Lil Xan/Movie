[Intro: Pollàri]
Lil bitch say she hate me, huh

[Chorus: Pollàri]
Lil bitch say she hate me, huh
I been gone lately, yeah
I been goin' crazy, yeah
Foreign on the daily, yeah
I might run this shit, oh
Diamonds, I'm the man, yeah
Shawty fuck the set, yeah
Shawty fuck the set, yeah
'Cause now I got Gucci, it match with the Ksubi
I can go home and go fuck me a groupie
I think she love me, my life is a movie
I think she love me, my life is a movie
'Cause now I got Gucci, it match with the Ksubi
I can go home and might fuck me a groupie
I think she love me, my life is a movie
I think she love me, my life is a movie

[Verse: Lil Xan]
Hard day, heartbreak
17 with heartache
Two-thirty, headache
Need sleep, get head, get brain
You like girls and I know that shit
My bitch foreign car cost a lot
909, I might slam that bitch
818, I need a Valley bitch
My name known, you just kinda lit
My girls moan, you stay moaning
Leave the crib, never home and shit
On the road, I seen a lot of shit
Cuddle bitches don't even fuck
Summer heat, that boy flexin'
Mercedes whip, I ain't even flexin'
Triple Z off a pill or somethin'
(Off a pill or somethin'
Dun-dun-dun-dun, ayy)

[Chorus: Pollàri]
Lil bitch say she hate me, huh
I been gone lately, yeah
I been goin' crazy, yeah
Foreign on the daily, yeah
I might run this shit, oh
Diamonds, I'm the man, yeah
Shawty fuck the set, yeah
Shawty fuck the set, yeah
'Cause now I got Gucci, it match with the Ksubi
I can go home and go fuck me a groupie
I think she love me, my life is a movie
I think she love me, my life is a movie
'Cause now I got Gucci, it match with the Ksubi
I can go home and might fuck me a groupie
I think she love me, my life is a movie
I think she love me, my life is a movie, yeah
