[Verse 2]
People judged me in school
Told me I wouldn't be shit
Now I'm up in Hollywood with a baby
I know that I do some shit that's questionable
But mama say do what I want and I'ma do what she told me
Baby just hold me
I got no problem but if I do I'ma solve em
I wanna see you tomorrow
Can you make plans with me baby
I just wanna hold your hand like what
When we dance, yuh
Long time ago in Santa Monica Bay oh
And I ain't know what up, aye

Who are you?
I'm out here fuckin' bitches though
Who are you?
I'm out here gettin' riches though
Who are you?
