[Intro]
Xanarchy
G-g-go 'head, O
Danny, I see 'em!

[Chorus: $teven Cannon]
Fuck hate, I don't do the fake, errybody fake
New heartbreak every other day, shit just ain't the same
Stay awake, get up out my way, errybody a fake
Need a tank, I'm about to blow, you don't feel my pain
Fuck hate, I don't do the fake, errybody fake
New heartbreak every other day, shit just ain't the same
Stay awake, get up out my way, errybody a fake
Need a tank, I'm about to blow, you don't feel my pain

[Verse 1: Lil Xan]
Yeah
Off a pill, yeah, I'm sorry, but I still do them shits, yeah
Addiction really hard, but I promise ima kick that shit, yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy
At least I'm being honest, I don't fake shit just like other dudes, yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy
Money changed my family once they knew my salary
It was like we all had beef
Had to tell my mama that I love her, but stop calling me, yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy
Everybody askin' how I blew up quick
I ask the same fuckin' question, do you know that shit?
How you go from being broke to owning three new cribs
Like, all that flexin' for the 'Gram, man, you know that shit
Like, other rappers poppin', but all them bank accounts floppin'
Probably cos' of all that motherfuckin' flossin'
Like, money, fame, and bitches, and that model never changin'
And, Lil Xan died, but Diego still bangin'
Money, fame, and bitches, and that model never changin'
And, Lil Xan died, but Diego still bangin'

[Chorus: $teven Cannon]
Fuck hate, I don't do the fake, errybody fake
New heartbreak every other day, shit just ain't the same
Stay awake, get up out my way, errybody a fake
Need a tank, I'm about to blow, you don't feel my pain
Fuck hate, I don't do the fake, errybody fake
New heartbreak every other day, shit just ain't the same
Stay awake, get up out my way, errybody a fake
Need a tank, I'm about to blow, you don't feel my pain

[Verse 2: $teven Cannon]
Minute Maid, Minute Maid, yellow bar, lemon laid
I wonder how many hatin' niggas I run in today
Diamonds on my neck doin' numbers like a figure 8
Fucked a bad bitch, she was boring than a Himaleya
Kiwi bitch, don't you wanna vibe when I come in town?
Banana clip, we get Donkey Kong if you talkin' down
Knockin' anybody in my path tryna slow me down
Drownin' in your bitch, if I die, who gon' hold me down
Fucked up since last week, this gas made my chest weak
Early mornin', fast creek, pussy on my bed sheets
Pullin' up in [?], Gucci vision HD
I can tell no bitch no lie, know she wanna date me

Xanarchy

[Chorus: $teven Cannon]
Fuck hate, I don't do the fake, errybody fake
New heartbreak every other day, shit just ain't the same
Stay awake, get up out my way, errybody a fake
Need a tank, I'm about to blow, you don't feel my pain
Fuck hate, I don't do the fake, errybody fake
New heartbreak every other day, shit just ain't the same
Stay awake, get up out my way, errybody a fake
Need a tank, I'm about to blow, you don't feel my pain
