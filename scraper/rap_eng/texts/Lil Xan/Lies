[Intro]
(Yeah-eah)
Yeah, ugh (Prrra-)
Yeah, yeah
You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, ay

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
Pray to god, like Allah
Please slit my throat
And when you lie, I wanna die
Please slit my throat
You seen me high, almost died
Wanna slit my throat
They gon' cry when you die
Cause that's just how it goes
Pray to god like Allah
Please slit my throat
And when you lie, I wanna die
Please slit my throat
You seen me high, almost died
Wanna slit my throat
They gon' cry when you die
Cause that's just how it goes

[Verse 1: Lil Xan]
Yeah, no more heartbreaks
I made so many mistakes
Like this bitch might just be the one
They use me, they wanna be someone
Like "Go and get yourself a job"
I cannot be compared to y'all
And if I do not make it, tell my mom this life is fake
And I don't wanna make the same mistakes I made when I was basic (when I was basic yeah, when I was basic yeah)
Yeah I rap, but I still fly coach
Yeah I'm rich, but I still don't boast
Yeah I'm sad, please slit my throat
Yeah I'm sad, please slit my throat (I'm sad, please slit my throat)
Heartbreak soldier, caffeine, drinking soda
Flip her like some yoga
Stuck inside my mind, I need some peace, I need a dojo
Said I'm stuck inside my mind, I need some peace, I need a do-jo

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
Pray to god like Allah
Please slit my throat
And when you lie, I wanna die
Please slit my throat
You seen me high, almost died
Wanna slit my throat
They gon' cry when you die
Cause that's just how it goes
Pray to god like Allah
Please slit my throat
And when you lie, I wanna die
Please slit my throat
You seen me high, almost died
Wanna slit my throat
They gon' cry when you die
Cause that's just how it goes

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Okay, so this little light of mine
Tattoos all down my spine
Everybody know that I'm on my grind
Always at a place where the sun don't shine
The media wanna make me a bad guy
I don't know if I'm happy, you're right
I stay inside, and I pray up to Christ
Hoping one day, I don't end my life
Way too depressed to express how I feel
Only smoke weed, sometimes on pills
Just a nightmare, I don't know what's real
She came back around since I got that deal
I don't want friends, I want a happiness
She did me dirty, it's "fuck that bitch"
I was so broke, but now I'm rich
Still the same gang, still the same clique
Xanarchy shit, tell that hoe make a wish
From the touch when we kiss
My hands on her hips, fell in love with her lips
Make her swallow my kids
The world is so evil, while we lost in the mix
Tryna' make it make sense
So I wanna know does it matter to you
That I don't have no fucks to give?
Bitch!

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
Pray to god like Allah
Please slit my throat
And when you lie, I wanna die
Please slit my throat
You seen me high, almost died
Wanna slit my throat
They gon' cry when you die
Cause that's just how it goes
Pray to god like Allah
Please slit my throat
And when you lie, I wanna die
Please slit my throat
You seen me high, almost died
Wanna slit my throat
They gon' cry when you die
Cause that's just how it goes

[Outro: Lil Xan]
That's just how it goes, that's just how it goes
Never wanna ever wanna let you go
That's just how it goes, that's just how it goes
I ain't never ever ever wanna let you go
Yeah, ayy, oh
Yeah, ayy, oh
Out the booth, out the booth, out the booth-
Yeah!
