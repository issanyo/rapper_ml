Mayfair

You know how I like it when u lay there

(yeah)

Sex in the bathroom we don't play fair

I know I know I know I know it hurts

But we’re rolling up

Yeah we're rolling up in the Mayfair

Space
Get laced
Yeah you say it with a frown on your face
You say you love me
But that really ain’t the case
I wanna trust you
But we silly being mates
No dates
We just roll up
When we woke up every morning Issa smoke up
Baby let me take a picture, that’s a close-up
And we party party hard till you throw up

CuzI know how you know how we turn up
If you need yourself a heart then I’m your donor
(Yeah)

And we ain’t ever pay attention to no opps
(Oh no oh oh)

Pussy dripping, even wetter than the Voss

Checking out of the club
Checking into the ritz
Yeahhh
She say she a blood
But she more like the crips
Yaaa

You know wassup girl this foreal
In the colors we can feel alive

Mayfair

You know how I like it when u lay there
Sex in the bathroom we don't play fair

I know I know I know I know it hurts

But we’re rolling up

Yeah we're rolling up in the Mayfair

Baby just hop in the ride
With the mob only rocking with offwhite
F with the stars an astronomers life

Money cash
Run it back
Captain mag
Captain Jack
You know I never lack

Owe me I get it back
This be my favorite track
Counting my favorite racks

I beg for nothing
Ciroc In my cup

I’m breaking down all these hoes
With my tongue

Uno

She know I’m ready
To fuck

Look at my white girl just sitting there
Looking sublime
