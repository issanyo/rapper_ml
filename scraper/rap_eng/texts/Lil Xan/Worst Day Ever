[Intro: Lil Xan & $teve Cannon]
Yeah
And it's the worst day ever (Yeah)
Yeah
And it's the worst day ever (Ay)

[Verse 1: Lil Xan]
I overheard a convo, yeah (Woo, woo, woo)sounded like you liked him (Yeah)
I ain't mad that she cool girl (Brrt, brrt, brrt)
I've been fucking bitches since you said the first word
I was off them pills too, yeah
Maybe I'ma die too (Maybe I'ma die too)
Hope I just don't die soon (Hope I just don't)
I said "I hope I just don't die soon" (Hope I just don't)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Orange and black coffin (Brrt, brrt)
Yeah, have it painted by an orphan (Brrrrrt)
I'm a demon but you know it (Know it)
Yeah, I break hearts because my heart is broke

[Verse 2: $teve Cannon]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hell yeah, I grew up and screw up
Shit go around like a Hula
Lost in a trap like Bermuda
I smoke my dope to this music
Think I'm seein' illusions
These people think I might lose it
Back on the Xan's and I'm coolin'
Off with their head, throw up deuces
And it's the worst day ever
Higher than I've ever been
Hit me up at night 'cause she know I need that medicine
Workin' 'til the lights turn out
Wake up and do again
All my niggas 'round
Oh my god, there's only few of them
Swimmin' in that ocean, I don't even see the coast
And don't know which side to has some lean
So I could fly through my feelings
I really feel like it's over
I really wish I was sober
I really wish I was older
I really wish I was in it

[Refrain: Lil Xan]
Yeah, aye
And it's the worst day ever, yeah
And it's the worst day ever, yeah
And it's the worst day ever, yeah
And it's the worst day ever

[Outro: Lil Xan]
Rest In Peace
Xanarchy
