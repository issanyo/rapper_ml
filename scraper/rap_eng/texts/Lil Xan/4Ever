Lil Xan
Why you so god damn fly?

[Chorus]
Faded forever, faded forever
I'm faded forever, I'm faded forever
I'm faded forever, I'm faded forever
I'm faded forever, I'm faded for, uh aye

[Verse]
Faded forever my diamonds more clever
I stay in the hills, but got bitches in Denver
Do what I say you don't wanna see temper
Beat up the pussy like Semper Fi
Only fuck bitches with Wi-Fi
Fuckin' bitches yeah a dyke dyke
Cruise at a funeral, I need some Vicodin
Riding in whips, while you riding the bike again
Talixan gang, Talixan bang
My momma telling me she like my music
My poppa telling me please don't abuse it
That won't stop me man, I'm still gon' abuse it
My bitch tell me that she think I'm a junkie
Funny bitch no I do not care opinion
Make me some food and go clean all these dishes
My life ain't real, my shit is fictitious
Punk rocker bitch, you could call me Sid Vicious

Aye, Whoa, Damn, Hey (goddamn)
Aye, Whoa, Damn, Hey (goddamn)
Aye, Whoa, Damn, Hey

Aye, You broke as shit, aye (what)
You slow as shit, dang (huh?)
Rap ain't your thing (yeah)
Pass me the blunt
I am a slut, trappin' like what
Trappin' like what, fill up my cup
Fill up my cup, fuck it all up
Aye, Oh Shit, Goddamn

[Chorus]
Faded forever, faded forever
I'm faded forever, I'm faded forever
I'm faded forever, I'm faded forever
I'm faded forever, I'm faded for, uh aye

[Verse]
Bitches get salty, now spray 'em with pepper
They learn their lesson, yeah, I will finesse 'em, aye
I pop a xan, ain't no more stress
I fuck your bitch, she say I am the best
Dough just for dealer, he really a hitta'
Lowgang the team

They really get butt hurt, they don't see the plan

Why? I do not understand

Why they gonna hate on us?
Why they gonna hate on us?
Why they gonna hate on us?
Why they gonna hate on us?

You still pressing play

[Chorus]
Faded forever, faded forever
I'm faded forever, I'm faded forever
