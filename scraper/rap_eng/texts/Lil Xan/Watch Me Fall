[Intro]
Yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
Don't watch me fall
Don't watch me fall down, yeah, ayy (Take, take it easy when the night falls)
Don't watch me fall down, yeah, ayy, yeah
Don't watch me fall down, yeah
Don't watch me fall down, oh, yeah, ayy
Don't watch me fall down

[Verse 1]
You left me broken, left on the side
I don't understand anything but time (Ooh)
And if you run away, I swear to God I'll chase you, girl
You know me and how I be (Yeah, ayy)
I'm ready for war, I'm ready for war
I'm ready for war-ar-ar-ar-ar
I'm ready for war
I'm ready for war-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar

[Chorus]
Don't watch me fall down, yeah, ayy
Don't watch me fall down

[Verse 2]
You left me broken, left on the side
I don't understand anything but time (Ooh)
Don't watch me fall down, yeah, ayy, yeah
Don't watch me fall down, yeah
Don't watch me fall down

[Chorus]
Don't watch me fall down
Don't let me fall down
Don't watch me fall down
Don't let me fall down
Don't watch me fall down, oh
Don't let me fall down
Don't watch me fall down

[Outro]
We go to sleep at night
Don't know if I'll wake
We go to sleep at night
Don't know if I'll wake
