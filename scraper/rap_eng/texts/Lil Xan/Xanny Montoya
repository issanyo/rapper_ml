[Intro]
Lil Xan outta commodity
Play games like Monopoly
If I’ma game it’s Monopoly

[Chorus]
I might just drown in yo’ bitch (yo' bitch)
She might go down for the risk (the risk)
She knows these diamonds ain’t shit (ain’t shit)
I got my wrist takin risk (takin risk)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
I might just drown in yo’ bitch (yo' bitch)
She might go down for the risk (the risk)
She knows these diamonds ain’t shit (ain’t shit)
I got my wrist takin risk (takin risk)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)

[Verse]
Xanny Montoya just pop me a bean
Xanny Montoya go swim in the lean
Bought me a house now I have my own lease
Yo’ bitch she buckle up got me a leash
Hundred degree with the weather in streets
Pussy so wet when she under my sheets
Going too hard on all of these beats
People keep saying that I am a beast
Got all my gold at the dentist (dentist)
Rapping ‘til I get my pension (pension)
I can’t keep paying attention (attention)
Don’t pay no bitch no attention (no attention)
Aye, I might black out in the booth
She know I’m smoking up boof
Aye, I’m with the new Audi Coupe
Aye, I’m with the new Audi Coupe

[Bridge]
Vroom, vroom, vroom, I got the car to clear the room
He might catch a fade if I go find him at my pad
Zoom, zoom, zoom, I can’t sweep her like a broom
He might see the blade or low life gon’ beat his ass

[Chorus]
I might just drown in yo’ bitch (yo' bitch)
She might go down for the risk (the risk)
She knows these diamonds ain’t shit (ain’t shit)
I got my wrist takin risk (takin risk)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
I might just drown in yo’ bitch (yo' bitch)
She might go down for the risk (the risk)
She knows these diamonds ain’t shit (ain’t shit)
I got my wrist takin risk (takin risk)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)

[Verse]
I ain’t smoking on the dirt (dirt)
I don’t lean I like 'em dirt (dirt)
She know I’m fucking her first
Imma run up out of thirst
I don’t talk to these bitches
Oh my god she a witness
Gotta pay her a visit
She ain’t even let me finish

[Bridge]
Vroom, vroom, vroom, I got the car to clear the room
He might catch a fade if I go find him at my pad
I don’t need no shrooms I’d rather sit and watch cartoons
He went M.I.A then I told his bitch my bad, aye

[Chorus]
I might just drown in yo’ bitch (yo' bitch)
She might go down for the risk (the risk)
She knows these diamonds ain’t shit (ain’t shit)
I got my wrist takin risk (takin risk)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
I might just drown in yo’ bitch (yo' bitch)
She might go down for the risk (the risk)
She knows these diamonds ain’t shit (ain’t shit)
I got my wrist takin risk (takin risk)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
She know I’m tryna get lit (lit)
