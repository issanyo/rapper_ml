[Verse 2]
Pretty boy swag like I'm Soulja
I smoke on that [?] comatose ya
Cook at my mama's but now that's a no bruh
I serve out the trap [?]
Might trade in my gold for some platinum
But I'll keep my diamonds [?]
I'll keep my boys cause they scrapped up
[?] like a match up
[?] get me a hat trick
I saw your girl, that shit plastic
My shit shoot lights like I'm astrics
I do the plays, call me Madden
Get to the bag that's a habit
Get to the bag that's a habit
My bitch straight up out the look book
Ask me how I do it, I ain't even got a cook book
[?] get your motherfucking wrist took
You live your life every step by the book
I live by recipe know how to cook'
