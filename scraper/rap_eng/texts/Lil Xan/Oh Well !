[Intro- Steven Cannon, Lil xan]
Shout out my nigga Kyrie, dude
Imma do it now
Imma do it now
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, uh

[Chorus]
Way end up on the scale
I'm a Mac you a Dell
I don't even need to sell
Everything I do is well
Flow is flowing like a well
Blessin flowing like a whale
All my shit is doing well
Everything I do is well

[Verse- $teven Cannon]
I'm a diver with a scale
I magyver with the belt
She a princess with the peach
Donkey kong with the dance
Naked bitch made the boss
I ain't goin' back to jail
I fit a ship in my pocket
I know a nigga that's gonna crop it
Trappin' 'til I'm in the tropics
Rich as a hydroponic
Versace all over my ass
Being this fly don't need class
Nigga I break in the brass
Bitch and she shakin' that ass
Imma do what a nigga do
Droppin' a xan in my juice, aye

[Chorus- Steven Cannon]
Way end up on the scale
I'm a Mac you a dell
I don't even need to sell
Everything I do is well
Flow is flowing like a well
All my shit is doing well
Everything I do is well
Blessin flowing like a whale

[Verse- Lil Xan]
Everything I do is well
Yeah everything I do is well, aye
Everything I do is well, aye
Everything I do is well, aye, yeah
Everything I do is well yeah
Yeah they hate me oh well
Super rich I bake bell
Lady friend want the dick
Shove it all in her hip, yeah
I might just nut on her lip, aye
Whip is foreign like my bitches
With my hoe she my mistress
Triple six on my dick, tit
Eating breakfast I ain't leaver her tip
Treat a Honda like I wouldn't, flip
Doin' donuts are my favorite, shit

[Chorus- $teven Cannon]
Way end up on the scale
Im a Mac you a dell
I don't even need to sell
Everything I do is well
Flow is flowing like a well
Blessin' flowing like a whale
All my shit is doing well
Everything I do is well

[Verse- Lil Xan]
Aye yeah take a pic
Watch me bitch
Mob a grit
Ate a bitch
Start a scene
Level up
Smellin' hoes, smelli'n hoes, yeah
Dat my hoe
Takin (?) and it might be purple
Poppin' xannies and you know they pressed
Poppin' xannies and you know they pressed
Why?

[Chorus- $teven Cannon]
Way end up on the scale
I'm a Mac you a dell
I dont even need to sell
Everything I do is well
Flow is flowing like a well
Blessin' flowing like a whale
All my shit is doing well
Everything I do is well
