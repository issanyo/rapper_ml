Booty fat as fuck and then I pipe her down
Little mommy hot so I ice her down
Got the pussy humming like a Viper now

Rock n roll on the 10
Getting dome in the Benz
Cartier frames with the lens
And she came with some friends
Got the hoe in Michael Kors

I can't do a divorce, aye
Now she bout to cop a Porshe
Know it's time to fuck when my knives come off
Gettin to the money, that trait don't rub off
Finessing with the pound like the coke ran off
Puss dancing on my dick like Ice La Fox
