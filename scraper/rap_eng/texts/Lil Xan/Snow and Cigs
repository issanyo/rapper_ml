[Hook: Yung Dano]
Come in with the xanny and the smoke
Yeah I pull up fancy with the coat
People cannot stand me with the hoes
Diamonds icy, damn they did this cold

[Verse 1: Yung Dano]
Got designers and I pop a lot of these
You just want me down like your [?]
You would trade the devil your soul
Just so you could get bands when you're old
Me [?] I'm young
You do not [?] this you're dumb
Me I just rolled up a blunt
And you think you're having fun
Studio six one
And you know this shit slaps
Got a bitch just hit me
Probably won't hit her back

[Hook: Yung Dano]
Come in with the xanny and the smoke
Yeah I pull up fancy with the coat
People cannot stand me with the hoes
Diamonds icy, damn you did this cold

[Hook: Yung Dano]
Come in with the xanny and the smoke
Yeah I pull up fancy with the coat
People cannot stand me with the hoes
Diamonds icy, damn you did this cold
The xanny and the smoke
Yeah I pull up fancy with the coat
People cannot stand me with the hoes
Diamonds icy, damn you did this cold

[Verse 3: Yung Dano]
Diamonds icy, diamonds icy
Are you off the xan? I said lil bitch I might be
Oh no they're fighting fighting
Got this bitch beside me, she wanna get it nightly
Woah woah, pull up with xan in my hand
Woah woah, pop xans [?]
No, no, no xan with me can't stand
Still feeling like the man
You wanna do it but you can't
