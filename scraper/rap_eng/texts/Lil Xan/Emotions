[Intro]
Xanarchy
Yeah!
Ay

[Verse]
Girl, you my everything
You deserve a wedding ring
Moving on to better things
Yeah, I get so jealous
But believe me, that's cos' I love you
And if I catch you with another dude, we end up on the news
Ay, or better or worse, I know that love hurts
And my question if it's worth it, I said questions uncertain
What's the point if you gon' lie though
You don't have to hide yo
I know you was a hoe, but baby, we could fix that
Or maybe I should kick back
And fuck other bitches while she fucks other dudes, yeah, ay
And while she fucks other dudes
Yeah, while these bitches send me nudes, yeah

[Chorus]
What's the point in falling in love, yeah
You just gonna lose, yeah
Cos' feelings really hurtin' now
I think I can't handle
Every year go by and I'm blowing out more candles
Waiting, waiting, waiting for the future
A future without you might be the future that I choose
How am I gonna fuck you when I know who you've fucked
I know the past is the past, but the past is so ba-a-ad
Yeah, ay, so ba-a-a-a-a-ad
So bad
Yeah, ay, so ba-a-a-a-a-ad
So bad

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
What's the point in falling in love, yeah
You just gonna lose, yeah
Cos' feelings really hurtin' now
I think I can't handle
Every year go by and I'm blowing out more candles
Waiting, waiting, waiting for the future
A future without you might be the future that I choose
How am I gonna fuck you when I know who you've fucked
I know the past is the past, but the past is so ba-a-ad

[Outro]
Yeah, ay, so ba-a-a-a-a-ad
So bad
Yeah, ay, so ba-a-a-a-a-ad
So bad
Yeah, ay, so ba-a-a-a-a-ad
So bad
Yeah, ay, so ba-a-a-a-a-ad
So bad
