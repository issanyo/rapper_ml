[Intro: Ben Great]
Shot, i realized it girl
My nigga Lil Xan, i see you
Even though you ain't here yet
But you on your way, you hear me?

[Verse 1: Ben Great]
I hit grams in the living room
Hit my line when you come around
I got a past i won't speak about
If i did, i would let you down
My niggas got it in the highway
Niggas did it when they out of town
We've been trapping since some young niggas
Ain't a thing that can slow us down
Had a dream then i rolled it out
I'm a king, I'm the chosen child
I'm doing me, but they love my style
In a sea with a black n' mouth
Kick yang like I'm Bruce Lee
Bad bitch with some double D's
She ain't never seen a trap house
It's da real, It's da ooh whee, ooh whee

[Chorus: Ben Great & Lil Xan]
Don't trap on me (don't trap on me, nah)
Don't trap on me (don't trap on me, nah)
Don't trap on me (yah)
Bitch can't get a pack from me (never, ever, ever, ayy yah)
Don't trap on me (don't trap on me, nah)
Don't trap on me (don't trap on me, nah)
Don't trap on me (yah)
That bitch can't get a pack from me (never, ever, ever)

[Verse 2: Lil Xan]
Ayy, yah, don't trap on me
Bitch don't fuckin' trap on me
Yah, don't trap on me
Bitch don't fuckin' trap on me
Yah, like trapanese
Bitch i feel like trapanese
Down, like trapanese
Bitch i feel like trapanese
Yah, ayy she pull up in a robber lookin' real cute
This and I'm payin' my shit turn and met her real cute
Damn, I need a bitch you gonna suck me off, yah
Ayy, I need a bitch that never gonna die, yah
Ayy, no heartbreaks, over this way, yah
Ayy, no heartbreaks, never this way, ayy
Yah, ayy, she just like the way that it swang, yah
Ayy, yah, she just wanna cum on a plate, yah
Ayy, yah, tell me bout' way fucking back, yah
Ayy, when your problems meant no problems way back, yah
Ayy, weight on my back I got a weight off the world
Then they wanna see me fall
But I just wanna ball'

[Chorus: Ben Great & Lil Xan]
Don't trap on me (yah, don't trap on me)
Don't trap on me (ayy, what up babe, yah, ayy)
Don't trap on me (ayy, yah, ayy)
Bitch can't get a pack from me (yah, yah)
Don't trap on me (bitch don't fuckin' trap on me)
Don't trap on me (don't you fuckin' go trap on me)
Don't trap on me (bitch, yah, ayy, yah)
