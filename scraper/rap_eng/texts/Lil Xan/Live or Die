[Pre-Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
On our way to the sky
We're gonna look down on tonight
When we die, you and I
Two heartbreak soldiers
When you lay by my side
I see the whole world through your eyes
Ride or die, you and I

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
Live or die, yah
Live or die
Got you and I
Got you tonight, yah
Live or die, yah
Live or die
Got you and I
Got you tonight

[Verse 1: Lil Xan & both]
Have you ever seen a red flower? Yeah
Have you ever seen a gold flower? Aye
Came from a broken home, parents never saw it
Now I'm living all alone, taking care of us all, yeah
Flashes in my face, I guess that's what you get with all this fame
Just because you say you gang does not mean that you really gang
Weather changes with my mood, it never really stays the same
And one plus one is two, and without you I think I'd go insane
And what you think? Pause, let it sink in
They threw me in and now I'm drowning in the deep end
If I'm religious, you're the one that I believe in
You've been here with me to help me fight all my demons

[Pre-Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
On our way to the sky
We're gonna look down on tonight
When we die, you and I
Two heartbreak soldiers
When you lay by my side
I see the whole world through your eyes
Ride or die, you and I

[Verse 2: Lil Xan, Noah Cyrus, both]
To live or die, what's the price on a life?
If there ain't no price tag, I might take it right
If I hit it from the back, I might just hit it twice
Rest in peace to everyone that we lost in life
And I just wanna run away-ay-ay
I just wanna run away-ay-ay
I just wanna run away-ay-ay, yeah-eah-eah-eah,ay
(With you, baby)

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
Live or die, yah
Live or die
Got you and I
Got you tonight, yah
Live or die, yah
Live or die
Got you and I
Got you tonight
