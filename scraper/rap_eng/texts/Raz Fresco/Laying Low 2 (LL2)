People be looking at me like im they way up out the projects
Can't put you on my payroll and I ain't got no rolex
Or no diamonds but im still shining, grinding, tail sliding, black Sheckler: Ryan
Why is these Bakers Club dudes so cool tho?

Boss shit Hugo never been Bruno Mars, better change how you are when you messing wit the Bakersclub
Baby got that million dollar master plan and that cold flow yeah that Colorado Avalanche
Red wings on my Jordans 2's switch the flow up
Lames try and copy what I do pick they hoes up
Lay the game down now they can't pick they noses up
