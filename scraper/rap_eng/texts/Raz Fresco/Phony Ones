[Intro]

You made it look like
You were playing
Your a phony, Your a big fat phony
That's right your a big fat phony

[Verse:1]
I grind for my niggas tryna get they money
I floss for them broads that was acting funny
See me doing good so now she tryna love me
But I just hit it when I see er, she my punch buggie
On my grind cause dollar signs haunt my mind
All this time was underpaid
Now my name underlined , Bold - print , Oh shit
She just wanna shine like a glow stick
That's why I break her off , then I shake her off
Can I kick it
Niggas wanna fly
But they ain't tryna buy no ticket
I just laugh at em'
While I'm shooting jumpers from the Xbox
Debuting some deadstocks
Writing on my handheld
Refusing a wedlock
Oreo Jordan 6's tell me how my feet taste
Ayo this should've been an album for pete sakes
Got these Jordan 3's on
I rock em' for petes sake
And it's a rocky road to get that cheesecake

[Hook]
But we gettin to g-g-gettin to it
Gettin to it , We gettin to it
They see us gettin too it

[Verse:2]
These songs is my life
The grind is my wife
Got a Jordan 8 sole
And money on my brain
Nigga we ain't built the same
And ain't it funny
How I barely got dimes
And my pockets is full of change
And now they all change like a fashion show
And I see the bull like a matador
She ain't gettin past the door
And I ain't gonna pass that dough
Unless it's to my niggas though
I do the impossible Brad Pitt
You just picture 4
Get it, All spittin , Flow drippin
Dough gettin , Dough drippin
Rippin Hoes
They be jumpin to the parrow
They be like oh damn
Yo I ain't know you had those
I has those
Cause shit ain't a game like them hasbros
And if it was a game
I'd be tryna get on boardwalk
Tryna get that bread all on me like a corndog
For all you bastards my Jordan 7's veloceraptors
F y'all chatter , Talk is cheap and y'all ain't never matter
Verbal paint splatter on the blank canvas platter
Got that perfect baker batter
For that cake that they be after
I ain't never had no back up
I just wanted to be a rapper
I just wanted to be Vince carter
Before he had left the Raptors
Money comes first and the broads come after
She said I don't like you cause you a rapper
Passed her trash compactor that's garbage
Keep it one-hunnid you wasn't there from the starting
Don't change

[Outro]
Just cause we gettin to it , gettin to it
Gettin to it , they see us gettin to it
So they tryna get into it , Shit
Phony Niggas
I swear these niggas change when you gettin tooo it
I swear these girls change when you gettin tooo it
That money ho , yeah that money ho
Like me now but you was acting Phony though
Phony Though
