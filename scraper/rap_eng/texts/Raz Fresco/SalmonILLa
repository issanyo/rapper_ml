You ain't never seen a nigga this fly
In my air Jordan 5's, give a nigga high fives
Im gold chain Mike to these dudes on sidelines
And they needa step back cause im finna take flight
Mike in the church cause a nigga sky high
No im Mike Tyson to these beats that im biting, chewing, eating
Forever punch lining, but you gon need more that Mario to punch me out
Never on the rebound, cause I don't need no rebound
Unless we talking hoes then im no shirt Boris b Diaw
Air Jordan 4's with the strings out
Og's my kicks gon see now, like a old nigga
And you ain't gotta ask chill where his gold nigga, I ain't in my nose nigga
But im calling picks out from the bleachers, deadstock sneakers
Hasta la vista!

Spit raw shit salmonella
Deadstocks locked up longer then mandella
Stella, Got my groove back, smooth black, suede blue hat, with the rap-
Tor on the front, flame on the blunt, name on the front
Of your chick page with the love
Heart sign right beside it, make you wanna sign out when you see it
Pardon my sneakglish, im decent, that's what the least Ill niggas be speaking
Don't got a G2, but im flyer then a G6
I get colder the higher, I get up call it ski lift
With the wifey, use the purse as a weed bag
As I pen greatness over bass, like rehab
And the sucker shit yall on, ain't making me mad
Cause if you check it out, it ain't making me cash
I mean it sound so trash that it's making me glad
That I got my own shit to listen to
Play it while I

[Chill Will]
Certain niggas got me feeling like caine
All I need now is some gold ropes and some rings
A couple babes, glass of lemonade
And I be standing under the green, but I ain't in the shade
But I do got these shadow number 10's on
Why all these niggas dancing in the endzone
And they ain't scored yet
A nigga asked me how your soles icy and you ain't leave the floor wet
I don't know though
But a bitch said I was so cold that her cell phone frose when she text me
Chopping on them blades like im Gretzky
Yall jabs weak, and I eat them punchlines for breakfast
With Mj on the box
In them Grape Jordan 5's and I like them a lot
That I might just cop bout 4 in my size
Yall niggas like Deadstocks, yall don't think out the box

[Raz Fresco]
But I ain't dissing you
Im just tryna tell you that this rap shit isn't you
This what the PYT's came to listen to
This the bakers club so the booth by the kitchen room
And the house don't got a roof
Cause it can't get higher than this
And you ain't gotta guess who supplying the zip
Filled with the realness filled with the illness
Millions and millions that's like a sure thing
Show me bout it, don't tell Me bout it that's the worst thing
The worst thing, since fox news on the TV
Harder I go, all the girls get easy
I don't use pick up lines, that shit cheesy
Use by beginners, im bumping that GZA
And if her brain like a genius, ima have to jizz her
One more line, bet I make the beat give up
