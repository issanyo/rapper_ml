[Hook: Raz Fresco]
The purple haze and the purple tape
The yellow gold kill em yellow tape
Ugh, swurving in bape, burning that dank, earning them stacks
Stacks ugh, i dont ever sleep i just meditate
Real pimp shit watch me demonstrate, ugh
Swurvin in bape, burnin that dank
Earnin them stacks....

[Verse 1: Raz Fresco]
Tryna make cream
Stressing a nigga im smokin til my eyes bleed
Im letting em know, that everything ain't what it seems
They killing my soul, no yellow tape on crime scene, it just be, the
Police grillin on the block patrol, want us locked forsure, tryna stop the growth
At the bottom low, cuz we lost the code, who responsible, you gotta know
I keep it OG as possible, imposters flock, jock, tell em vaminos
Pablo lo down to the particles, ya opticals, is optional
Gotta feel this, put my new shitd in the whip, let it bang make the system blow
Ya sister know, i bend up it, hit it, rip it up, kill it up then im twisting dro'
Criminalized minds, reflect the times, institutionalized they intuitively wanna shine
I walk with the tao now, spit it out, like minerals make muthafuckas dig the flow
And the steez too no R2, might D2, double D bitches make em preview, 5 mics
Need it on the review, lotta fish in the game i just see food, i just b cool
Be me, can't be you, you be lame, peep flame, how i drop game like reboot
Been raised to stay true with no debate, been ill repping the club i can't be fake naw

[Verse 2: Tre Mission]
They know im on road, im going up, going up like a bong toke
I popped one in my ears and im on those, mission man never came with the wrong flow
You got it wrong tho, i bet he calm down, when i take his bitch from him like the dog pound
I never heard the four-fifth make the wrong sound, even my nigga source thats what hes on now
Me i spit greeze, but they love how i do it tho, every girl
Listen to the kid when they doing coke, didn't know
How to make money while a nigga make songs
But a nigga make songs now im doing both get me
Did it when they didn't wanna do it like Skeppy
I dont need pussy but i really like necky
I dont wanna know you i just show you to my nigga he a
Coke boy baby and he really like Becky's
Cokeboy yup so you know we like work
Put it in the pot and you know it might twerk
Going hard for the money like he married to the block so its
Something like sex cuz you know it might hurt
Even though my hands clean niggas know i like trouble
Back when you thought i was gonna write dirt
You dont really want it you was writing down bars cuz i
Bet that you thought i was gonna write first see em
Paranoid, probably pissed off at the past, and the steroids got em ticked off but the bag of the
Medi-care, let me lift off of the grass so im never here gettin blitzed off of the plant
And we gettin here
Getting fucked up its a wrap like a head of hair, how its fucked up in the back niggas
Never hear, you dont learn, you dont wanna feel then you better hear
Man im bone crusher with the strap so im never scared
