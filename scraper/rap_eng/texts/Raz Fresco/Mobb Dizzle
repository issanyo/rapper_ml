[Hook]
Trouble we get into when we spit on instrumentals
They say they bars hard, they be simple
Trouble we into when we spit on instrumentals
These niggas tryna aim for my temple
Trouble we get into when we spit on instrumentals
They say they bars hard, they be simple
Trouble we get into when we spit on instrumentals
These niggas tryna aim for my...

[Verse 1]
When the pen touch paper nigga it's mad static fans passing static
Massses stack the cherish, my golden sound [?] folding clowns
Posted now, never posing below the ground what goes around come back
And it hit you even harder don't bother talking revolver that ain't the solver
Evolver, these things'll haunt you leave all the offers
I'll scorch ya beats and sauce for the realist author
No war for a plan to off ya corpse they off ya
Hit and torch em sit back and cause the exhaust fumes
What you gon do? I'll have ya baked breaking easy
Believe me, Bishop is illy, tracks stay on repeat
I defeat, any nigga ready to contest, yes I do impress
I'm next look to invest, never stress when adressing the best
It's sess ses till I rest imma bless and finesse nothing less

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Nothing less than a doctor, only spot for me
Ain't hard to see I spark trees when we park the V
Impossibly, paused to see who's higher [?]
Ask [?] they yell Bishop the reviver
Who's liver? Nobody that you probably think
Their rhymes are extinct, we try to let em slide but they sink
Cause diamond and minks, take over their cranium
So ain't nobody playing em, they stay strayin em
Straight delaying em, we need to pray for em
If not, you lost your noggin, rappers I'm bothering
Flow cold like snow toboggan, they try to bog in for life
The mic is my knife, prepare for the cyph your flow born from a cyph
It's alright, I told you fuck it stay out of sight
It's like, when I be flowing don't you put up a fight
You born in the night, I asked for a light from the flight
And niggas surely be hype when there's blood in the pipe
Now that's life

[Hook]
