LIVE FROM HADES

I bring the buildings down like bush nigga
Honey berry back woods with the kush in it
The devil is alive just look nigga
At the libraries ripping pages out the books nigga

Watchu think they murked Qadafi for?
Watchu think they tryna stop me for?
And leave me broken like the school system
With they lies, unified, through the suit and ties

The beamer grey, backseat with a lisa raye
Every black man free will i see the day
Am i the one that gotta lead the way
Please be alarmed press snooze you might never wake

As they gather at the bohemian grove
My brother from another sat and read me a scroll
(ay what that say?) ain't no country for A-R-T
Just H-A, A-R-P... (thats fucked up)

The shit is like a movie black
Chem trails in the air the skies boobie trapped
Flouride in my water tap, and four guys on my phone tap
(its not a game nigga)

They heard im down with the G.O.D's..
They heard im down with the righteous..
They heard im cool with some street niggas..
That be on the nightshift...

My network so expansive, this grindlife is demanding
But the flow laid back its like i wrote it onna hammack
And put the world onna canvas

BLOOD OF SLAVES

Ayo the ink that i wrote this is from the blood of slaves
It ran on the ground for a hundred days
Then the skies opened up and the thunder came
Im one with the sun, its god over everything, thats everything

Even life if you the real mccoy, is it suicide?
If you drown ya self in your tears of joy
To escape the pain that could kill you just like that chopper noise
Kush loud like flocka voice, high tops got models moist

Its one car on the road but yet the human race
Races against itself, towards destruction while im in this polo blunted
Ugh, my earth said the flowers dieing cuz the sun ain't shining
Its like i say the right words with the wrong timing

But yo mind over matter peep how strong i am
Tunnel vision on that money nigga long island
I heard nigga meant slave back in texas
Then i heard it meant god back in kemit

This the year of the T.O, G.O.D rapping
Stop the world on its axis
In my eyes you see the passion
In my hand you see that backwoods
Im blasted ugh

Coming live from the screwface cap bitch, nothing given so i had to go grab it
Keep winning cuz im taking these chances, keep puffin gotta chief like kansas
Dont this sound like the new black anthem, muthafucka we the new black panthers
Stand up if you niggas can't stand it or stand down if you niggas can't stand us  x2

Cuz this the year of the T.O, G.O.D rapping stop the world on its axis
In my eyes you see the passion
In my hand you see that backwoods
Im blasted ugh

Coming live from the screwface cap bitch, nothing given so i had to go grab it
Keep winning cuz im taking these chances, keep puffin gotta chief like kansas
Dont this sound like the new black anthem, muthafucka we the new black panthers
Stand up if you niggas can't stand it or stand down if you niggas can't stand us
