Verse 2:
Ayo and it dont stop just another day
Know my team form so crystalline the city
So small everybody listening
So dont get caught slipping when you visiting

Macking game just got her all out
Matching game tap it til its all out
Tryna make moves mothafuckas tryna stall out
Swear my mind feels caged and i needa crawl out

Say she wanna talk but got nothing to talk bout
So in turn, she just spilling her heart out
She go to war for love and drop bombs out
But the ship needa anchor to hold it down

Say they got love they got love that go around
I got love real love for my main niggas
I shared everything when i never had shit
Why the fuck would i change cuz a lil fame nigga, ugh

What got into me, im tryna kick real in the fakest industry
That entertainment, mental slave shit, sell the false hope, dream containment
That financial class segregation, regardless, so many expectations yo
Thats why the blunt get seperated.. ignite the blunt thats elevation

Impatient niggas never waiting, use to skip class cuz the shit never made sense
Magnetized the flow yea im tryna make ends.. meet like soul mates, need that dough cake
Some show no faith, wanna see the God fall, still im outside when its coarse and the floor shake
You be inside like a bitch nigga dont hate, wit ya face screwed up, we just do us from the
