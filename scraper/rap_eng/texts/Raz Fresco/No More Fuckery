I am not singing darling

And come shake me rass hand
I will swim the ocean and climb the mountain
Seen and that going to change me
Seen because I am going to kill
The fuckery out there and people
Is going to be in demand for the truth
People is sick and tired of hearing
Bomboclaat bend down shake ya fucking booty seen
People is sick and tired of hearing
Darling I bloodclaat love you
You turn on the radio 24hrs a bomboclaat day
You hear darling I love you a man singing
A man wouldn't sing to the almighty a rassclaat
Him love the woman more than the creator
Who create the sun the moon and the
Bomboclaat stars I sick and tired of hearing
That bombo bloodclaat seen
