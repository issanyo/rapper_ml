[Verse 1: Raz Fresco]
Never the lover boy, I was the other boy
Heart crusher boy, let it burn, yeah Usher boy
She said "baby why you playing with me like a rubber toy?
You can get another girl, I can't get another boy"
Tried to make it work but now that shit is unemployed
And she blazing out the room looking like she Brandon Roy
Looking for some sign at the green like [?]
When I was just looking for a friend
But like it's hot outside, I never sweat her
When it come to that bullshit, I am Helen Keller
I do not care it or see it
Therefore it does not exist and she don't mean shit
She was one-half black, one-half white
But both sides gon' be gone by the end of the night
Now both sides looking at me like that ain't right
That ain't fair, that's just life
Uh, yeah, yeah, that's just life
And don't mind the Jordan 10's girl, that's just Mike
And you look so cute plus that hat's just right
Pay a hundred million dollars if that's your price
But obviously I don't have that much
So I guess I had to holler back when I got a stack
Copped the six pack, no weight lift
Just [?], so who's hard as me
Had a two-man squad, she was starter team
But she went ahead and Vince Cartered me
And honestly, I wasn't no ball hog
But I ain't tryna fight for it man, I ain't Balrog
I just hit the court and I ball hard
You was in your zone, I had my guard off
Then I took a loss, then I got crossed
That's the end of the play, I call it the playoffs

[Verse 2: BrinkInTheHouse]
A yo I got to hit the brakes, I don't think I can move on
Chilling like how must this shit take
Looking back now, I know it was a mistake
When I see this girl now, I get a minor distaste
In my mouth, but yo
I'm kind of disgusted how this shit went down
Now was it all worth it? I don't really know
When it first started, I thought I struck gold
Love origami, got to unfold
But that would pull the cork in your love bot
It was fun while it last, I ain't gon' lie
Man the nigga had fun when he twist that ass backwards
But nowadays, your call gets no answers
And I don't understand what you're even calling back for

Ayo, Raz, don't mind the shoutouts on this one right here

This goes out to my homegirl Angie, still mad at me
I just didn't want my baby momma to catch me
Natasha, Ashley, why you all angry
Sending me text messages so your man sees
Some of these girls just ain't with the romancing
[?], I met them at [?]
One thing in common, they both want marriage
But I don't really think I can take them too serious
Back to my summer love, let's just call her Maxine
Used to be a Brisk fan, said I'm on an up & up
My love love Kimberly, used to show my mother love
'Til I cheated on her, now she's colder than when summer's done
The [?] family, thanks for looking after me
