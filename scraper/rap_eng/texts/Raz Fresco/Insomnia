HOOK:

I lost
Sleep cause the grind, niggas is lost sheep in the
Mind, while I advance pass several times body
Beats if they grimy, my soul live in the 90s
Niggas that hate don't surprise me, they blow dick

Daily for cosigns, while i build up darts and
Body slam pop mcs on billboard charts with they
RnB rap vocals, fly my logo on they
Land, the plan mogul i coast coastal

VERSE 1:

And flow loco, post postal on the dolo
Roll o’s to the o zone, and owe my style to the
Ogs and fore fathers, before ours fuck
15 minutes of fame, i lust hours

They tryna con us like we pawns I can sense hate
Even Kan West know I spit Ye like Sensei I
Mastered the flow, flow hit foes like 12 guage
L.A weed chillin magazine 12th page you

See me, i shud wear a fez on my noggin call me
Easy, straight outta the city cleaner den squeegees my
Index finger and the middle hold the green leaf my
Pimp step hit em from a distance like the DC

Snipers, the crowd hands move like car wipers
Every bar fire like im forging em dis rap shit
Got me like formula 1 down these cash corridors like
Fireworks on new years eve they know im blowin up

Chillin blowin ashes off the dickies, coat mean
Bitches fall slinky off the pinky gold ring
Keep it one hunnid get fifty dough green
Everybody tryna b the goat b like nas hov

God flow, fucka hater jus the scan the barcode
The whole city wanna see R go, more then
Argos in charcoals like the grill nigga
Since a young age played the polo no marco

HOOK:

I lost
Sleep cuz the grind, niggas is lost sheeps in the
Mind, while i advance pass several times body
Beats if they grimy, my soul live in the 90s
Niggas that hate it dont suprise me, they blow dick

Daily for cosigns, while i build up darts and
Body slam pop mcs on billboard charts wit they
RnB rap vocals, fly my logo on they
Land, the plan mogul i coast coastal

VERSE 2:

Im like cam in the fur, but it ain't pink
Niggas wanna kno wat i throw in my cake mix
My style and yo style ain't the same shit
Catch me on dat graveshift... nigga

Goretex shit, shine like rolex links fully
Submerged in this life i live, fully enclosed in that
Fly ass benz, picture me rollin like papparrazi
Need it sloppy, call me papi….  as i

Accumulate the wealth no game needed cuz the pussy
Lubricate itself, wen im near yo, dey b tryna
Duplicate with stealth, can't compare to the asiatic
Charismatic, carrots flashing still bangin illmatic

Hot shit, lava, papa got dat on camera shit like
Rico hittin it from the back drink splashin and
I b adamant about my hate for the establishment
Fuck the rapper shit i gotta preach wat dey b practising like

Packaging gmo's and damaging the eco
System of the people dats blinded by they ego
Ahhh. mann. naw it can't b so
Bad u dont notice if u hit dat TV remote

Ima star u an asterisk my girl thick
4 palms just to grab dat glutius maximus
Daydream den i snap back to reality
Life always grabbin me, damn…
