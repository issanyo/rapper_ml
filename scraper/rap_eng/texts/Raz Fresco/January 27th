[Intro: Don Cannon]
Ladies and gentlemen
Haters and hatettes
I ain’t forget ya
No need for ? right now
You’re now listening to the sounds of the great Don Cannon
I would say we were back but um
They only say that when you out the hospital or a long vacation
So without further ado
I’d like to bring to the stage the Bakersclubs own
Commision
Well Imma let him speak for me
Kill em

[Verse 1]
January 27th 1995
That’s the day I came alive
This the story of the boy in the basement
Ragin like my red Jordan fives
Borderline crazy
Mexican shit baby
Chili ride up
Writing rhymes up daily
You could hate me and stay upset
But I’m back in the bitch like makeup sex
In some 8’s
And I got the season cleaned up
Taking over on my mind
I got that ? fever
Dreams of pharaoh gold and Cleopatra divas
They say like a movie had to switch my scene up
So I back room baboon work my ass off
Now it’s top floor ? take they pants off
And I bet they new era niggas take their off
When they see a young legend turn into their damn boss
I used to tell them all my dreams
They say get lost
All these girls fake I’ll have to settle for miss wrong
I swear they used to look at me like shit dog
And now I turn them backwards like crisscross
So don’t get this shit crisscrossed
A ? mixed up
A acrobatic flipped up
I really do this shit
I’ve been planning this moment since the first grade
Bakersclub,  the commission don’t act strange
I’ve been planning this moment since the first grade
I’ve been planning this moment since the first grade
I’ve been planning this moment since the first grade
Bakersclub,  the commission don’t act strange
You know the name Fresco on the back jersey
I don’t sleep I show rap mercy
Quit frontin’ like you niggas of young
This is 16 counts of murder one
So you suckas better get behind
This ain’t rap it’s the gift inside it
And I’m still steady dripping
Like when does that cash come
They gone wish they never doubted
How this rapper getting outed
Shows crowded
People mouthing the words I’m spittin
Greatness that’s the perfect description
And I do this every day
That’s how I’m living
Dudes snaking but their venom get them OG Jordan 6’s
Niggas bite that style so I switch it
On a seven digit mission
Bakersclub no admission
For you lames trying to get in
Yall Jokin’
Hoes see me, put their cameras on focus
But they never get the big picture
Even if they zoom out
My blueprint drew out
Hell you talkin’ bout
The steez killin’ where I walk
They got to ? the ground
Fly dude, if it’s Yao Ming
I’m still talking down
This ain’t bedrock, it’s bedrock
I got it down
