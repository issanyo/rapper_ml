Murderous, You ain't heard of this
...Cause niggas turbulence
My niggas in the cut, we burnin piff
Got her screamin my name gettin noise disturbances

Dont eff with the club, YO, its not worht it kid

Pimp flow audio wrapped in furs and minks

Verse 1

Im blunt and im blunted tell her what my intention is
She from tokyo, she can catch the drift, uh
The mecca like okafor, me and the club popping
Like sticky fingers at the source awards

Sticky fingers from the buddha tommy coppin
We prophets, out for profits, snatchin props and the
Dominant force be the almighty, godbody
John gotti... pablo uh

I plan songs like bank heist the dank nice
Like it got manners, never flex for cameras
Lo' bandana bandito cuz my mind steeple, uh
Elevated, heavily melanated

Regulatin rap cyphers like what the fuck you saying
Shine divine my raps sublime you a caveman
With the club in ya hand, YO, the pope speaking
Got the club in the back and MCs fleeing cuz we

Verse 2

Lets bring it back to when raw shit was rap, fuck it
Lets bring it back to when gods walked the grass, touching
The same land we car jack and blast rubber
Grips on, cuz it ain't, a sitcom

Niggas die everyday like rico say
For the fritolay, sneakers, chains, pussy, fame
But we above that... we in the sky in the
E31 8 series gold hubcaps

My shit bump like acne, link dustin rhodes
Boss up, turn bumpy johnson on bumpy roads
Toss up? never that, you should already know
Any throne mine when i put my mind to it

And i dont even right i just let my mind do it
I black out, then my spirit move the pencil
Clock dollars digital, poli with ex criminals
Call me the next general nautica vest killin u its
