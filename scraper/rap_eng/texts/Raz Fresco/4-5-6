HOOK:
I heard life is like a dice game, i got the 456, u roll trips
Expose snakes like the watch on the wrist
I explode like my cock in ya chick
I sip slower then a hour glass drip, hour glass hips

Bet they freeze time, our camp spit
Bet they rewind, bitch, bet im reclined in the
Spaceship, astral, face lemon greeney
Bleezys

VERSE:
Let the smoke rise like kundalini
Freely but nun free, even pussy cost time and
Time cost money, tryna make the money mine make a
Dime leak a fiji water bottle when she see me

Fish mcs guts all over my squeegee
Raz plus 10 for the hoes tryna see these and
50 plus new books from my man CC
100plus ways to die and this a freebie

Its raz but ra for short cuz its the god
I see you dudes white flaggin so play ya cards ima
.. blue eyes white dragon against the odds, like
2, 4, 6, i capture like matt barnes villanous

Nigga every megabyte megatron
Decepticon padawans paddle into a storm yo
Even wen her head gray my chick bomb
Like Boston marathon, be lost but never long cuz

VERSE 2:
Smoke risin like the sun in the east
Crumbling trees, each bar is another disease n
Anaphlaxis shock electro the block
Spiderman the web, mystique the gwap transform

Metamorphis like igneous rock, purple
To green to red to brown it dont stop
Uh, beauty and intelligence prerequisites
Grape 5s dat fresh prince resemblence

Fuck it my mind jewel encrusted my cuban illustrious
Dangle over the nautica lookin down at ya summit you
Tryna becommeth, the tommy hil ice rocking john
Gotti, godbody flow hit em like pump shotty
