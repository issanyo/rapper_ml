VERSE 1:
Ayo god its now or never, lets get this cheddar
Cuz if we rise now we rich forever, and if we die now we live forever
Lets divide thous and stick together
Im polo down in the frigid weather, hilfiger sweater

My divine speech be waist deep like tyrese
Til i top meech, puch i-roc z's at top speeds
Get it in til my eyes bleed, circa 93
Air jays, catch me on that cooler shit like shariff

Cuz we weak, so thats why i be on my black power
Shit, black fist clenched eurocentric sorroundings
Stay true til my last hour, go out blasting
If they comin for me like im mike jackson

..and until im watchin martin in the aston im
Carving out my name on the chest of these fake rappers call me
Pablo, acid wash jeans army jacket
Strictly, in it for the cash chips and all dat we

HOOK:
Staircase posted slangin knowledge in between tokes
Submachine quotes, submarine flows, griffeys match the
Dan marino throwback, now im up in the booth
Swallow the truth or jus swallow my youth is wat i

Tell em, too many dudess act like they on b4 they

Entourage rock lo hoes bon voyage from u
Cowards, to da nigga in dat eddie baeur

BRIDGE:
Ayo wadap god, gotta keep it g like dat
Muthafuck history cuz dey rewrite dat, im trying
Hard not to sin cuz it b like dat, wen u
Lost in the world, lost in this life

Niggas damn near 40, actin like they shorties
Shorties damn near 10, actin like they men
This the real news real news no cnn i dont
Feel u feel u.....

VERSE 2:
Tell em niggas get off us, with they bullshit offers, we scholars
I poke ya pocahontas regardless who want it?
The flow polished, like im mopping we righteous mobsters
Gotta be militant thats word to papa

Over the bluntfire, he spoke and said gotta help the people rise up
Fill the mind up, if not get use to niggas lined up
For prison systems, court systems, school systems
Fuck the system, they play neutral with hidden agendas

It ain't in my nature, to hate nature embrace paper
But in this world we live in gotta get it to be major
And none of us above the law except the law makers
All the rich people bend laws po' niggas break em

Im saying, ayo the skill god given
My shit really dope you just rick rossing it
Got that cali kush ain't tryna get caught wit it
So if the bwoy dem come im finna get lost with it im gone
