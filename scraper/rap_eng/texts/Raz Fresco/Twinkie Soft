INTRO:

Yea, uh, what
It's Fresco one time uh
One love to everybody on the grind you know what I'm saying
.. you see me you see the culture
... It's a reflection
But yo


HOOK:
Look
These niggas
Soft like twinkie fillings, it's the villain
Of course, I take em right back to the source
Life's a bitch you don't want that divorce or
Another mother with tears to replace her boy

Uh, the real MCcoy, the ploys poised and
Hoes rejoice, Fresco leave the punani moist, check
My blunt to big it needa hoist
I drop gems these niggas just drop noise


VERSE 1:

Ayo sweet
MCs is delicacies and all that
You know my steez all black, phat raps cats
Croissant soft randy moss in the back I
Jazzy Jeff toss blunt cigars and the dabs

We was sitting in class for like 14 years
But when we got up it was like musical chairs no
Seats for the weak, just weeks in the year, gotta
Move to the front we too busy shaking the rear

Listen here, every hustle really ain't a career
Every snake bites, sheds skin then re-appears
Yea, as the rain falls washin all my sins way
They goin to haiti and takin all the kids away

I dont insinuate, my rhymes spread like
Germs across interstates, airways and interspace
Internet, they go in ya soul and rob the inner safe
I get fly without the NSA while these niggas


HOOK:

Why these niggas
Soft like twinkie fillings, its the villain
Of course, take em right back to the source
Life's a bitch you don't want that divorce or
Another mother with tears to replace her boy

Uh, the real MCcoy, the ploys poised
Hoes rejoice, Fresco leave the punani moist, check it
My blunt too big it needa hoist yo
I drop gems you niggas just drop noise




VERSE 2:

And still
Mad niggas bite mad styles for mad clout and
Mad niggas do mad time for short gains
Mad niggas snake mad men for mad fame and
My niggas read mad books for mad brains

You need it in this world like oxygen toxygens
Locked us in, all of us, big brother watching us
Acrobatic politics Twist like Oliver
The truth hurt going down like hard liquor

I pray my niggas ain't a victim to a shooter
As the triple 6 on patrol in they cruisers
Plan empires, black Mariahs, lax
Beside us, we love em if we share minds i

Decode hieroglyphs up in my spare time cause yo
Real eyes, realize, real lies so i try to
Keep my heart clean, they intervene, cross em out
Circulate the dollars god circulate ya chiii


HOOK:

Niggas
Soft like twinkie fillings, it's the villain
Of course, I take em right back to the source
Life's a bitch you don't want that divorce or
Another mother with tears to replace her boy

Uh, the real MCcoy, the ploys poised and
Hoes rejoice, Fresco leave the punani moist, check
My blunt to big it needa hoist
I drop gems these niggas just drop noise
