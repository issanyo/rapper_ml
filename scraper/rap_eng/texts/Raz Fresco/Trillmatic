[Hook]
Double Cup
Pourin’ Up
Now These Bitches Wanna Fuck
FMF and CIA don’t know a team nicer than us
Flag around my head yea I got that shit tied up
Lean statche above my lip that’s that G shit word...up
[4x]Livin’ that trill life yea we gettin’ high as fuck

[Verse 1: Louie BiGGavell]
This for the bitches that be calling me cocky
And them niggas hatin’ on me
Cause they bitches be giving me toppy
I can't be a sucker
Never be a buster
Thuggin’ undercover
She thought she could play me but I ain't never trust her
Shit we only know each other because I wanted to fuck her
But I be lowkey chillaxing
And Mackin
Paper stackin’
To the ceilin’
Gold grillin
Cold chillin
Got my game from them niggas going bald like Crillin
Tryna be different cause ever nigga want a million
So im switchin’ up the game doing that shit you ain't feelin’
Cause ain't shit triller than a muhfuckin trillion
And honestly
I know the whole world gone be tellin’ me
That I’m the greatest of all time over Pac and B.I.G
But Im not there yet but ima be a T.O.P. D.O. Double G eventually
Eight doobies to the face damn I can't see
Im drinkin’ lean while yo girl drinking seed
#wordUP G

[Verse 2: Louie BiGGavell]
Stacking bread like a bad game of tetris
Only dating chicks with a body like a lexus
When I say a lexus
Im not talking bout a bitch name Alexis
Im talking bout that whip niggas need an advance just to purchase
Crazy
Got the biscuits and the gravy
Call me Festus
Chillin’ with them niggas in all black but they not gothic
They be invading pads Van Dam straight robbin’
And im dozing off I just popped a hydro
But these hoes still tryna fuck pullin’ on my clothes
Speakin’ of them clothes
Always in a tee no polo
Trill shit slow down the track that’s my fast flow
Got these girls puffin with the kid now that’s powerful
Uh my nigga I be three hot
That’s why word up was more anticipated than Detox
And I stay with an Arizona
Mix it with the tussin now we sippin’ stronger than corona
Pimpin’ dames kicking one out than invite the next one over
Highway to success solo…no chauffer
