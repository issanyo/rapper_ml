[Intro:]
Let’s get it started
Who rock the hardest
Regardless
Buck is the smartest
My heart is set in stone
I’m heading home
Buck town’s where I roam
I’m in the zone

[Sung] We have just begin

[Verse 1:] [Buckshot]
From the underground to above
I provide [?]
And some guys that’s in need of love
Starving for attention like a school kid
The rap was a [?] quick nigga
I put in two years
You know i’m coming home to that [?]
Cause I stuck up the game
When I first left the ave
Yeah its true I got raw with no mask
But you niggas was nervous when you didn’t
So I blast and say
Fuck this past

[Chorus:]
We have just begun
[U’know what i’m saying]
We have just begun
[Holla at em buck]

[Verse 2:]
Man it’s a whole new era
And the closest ya’ll niggas get to the top
Is the dresser
Fightin near the lane
Humm, slamin’
That’s old school for just cool
Bring up the champion
I cover all topics
So I can blow the lid off your bullshit projects
Stop it
You ain’t made a profit
You made a promise
That shit is like a loan
Pfft… go’on
Bad business
My profile like bad bitches
Everybody wanna get a piece
And add digits, cool
When it comes to this
Rule 1 never get played
Like a video game by my son
I just begun
Y’know i’m saying
I’m number 1

[Verse 3:]
Dumb fuck
First of all you hustling backwards
Talk about you getting money for action
You a stupid motherfucker
And you know without askin’
Who wanna get paid for a couple of claps man
That’s when I see career collapsing
Fall like brick building from the ashes
Now even though they know they getting they ass kicked
Some old rappers still wanna compete in the masses
Ha… looking like muhammed ali
Out of his prime
And shorty like he outta his mind
Fine, the vets will get respect
But as a vet you subject to feedin em’ pets
Yep, so here’s a little [?]
Stick, don’t forget
You ain’t got shit on a ruler
True schoolin huh

[Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
I give a fuck if you feel this
The reincarnation of realness
I be schoolin niggas
This is the field trip
Drink from the coldness
With being police and soldiers
It’s like glue how we stick to the coldkit
From the o.G. Molding molds like moses
Microphones be the stack in my grip
Nagasaki explosion
From queens street rest to low street
Connected like olden phones glowing and [?]
Shorty you ain't a roll bitch
Roll this for the closure
Since when was niggas wearing skirts
Part of the culture
These niggas suck dick for a little exposure
But me I be the sun
So I shine right over motherfuckers like

[Outro:]
We have just begun
