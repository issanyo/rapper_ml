[Intro]
Wonderful music, yes

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we everywhere you go you can't ignore us
Ladies they adore us, fly and fresh from the floor up
I need less hype, more buzz,"What you drinking on?"
I ain't buyin', got an album out I ain't lyin'
She lookin' at me like, "Why he so cool?"
The only reason cause I ain't tryin', it's easy to me
I beat up the beat, I do it the way you supposed to
Talk mad shit but not social, crazy boy gone postal
Started off all local, now I'm bout to go global
November came I went loco, I'm crazy nigga I told you
I don't smoke but my folks do, I got a drug flow
But I'm dope too, I never lie I'm so true
I kill tracks but that's old news
I kill tracks and it's cold proof, I go ham and whole foods
I look fresh in those shoes, and I been real since '02
You know them rappers nowadays be sayin' nothin'
See I ain't got time for all they steady frontin'
They busy talkin' shit but they don't really want it
I just run it, but you runnin' from it

[Hook]
G-R-I-N-D, (what) What's that spell? That's grind
I got money on my mind, yeah that's money on my mind uh
D-R-I-V-E, (what) What's that spell? That's drive
On a road to the riches, no you can't hitch a ride
Said you got to do your own thing, got to do your own thing
On a road to the riches homie tell me what you gone bring
Said you got to do your own thing, got to do your own thing
The grind never stops homie, what you waitin' for mane?

[Verse 2]
Uh, you can't really reach for nothin', you cuffin'
You either in or out, you bout it or you bluffin'
I planned it all out there ain't no lucky nothin'
Nigga you get it if you really want it
What you think I'm here for, ? that I can't do
Went from niggas sleepin' on me
To tell me one thing that I ain't prove
See I got these dreams homie and I'm bout to achieve them all
The fact that I'm breathing means I'm here for a reason
Y'all, I last long, I hear y'all shit and fast forward
But niggas gotta rewind me
Boy I'm G-R-I-N-D-I-N-G, nigga that's grindin'
Pops says it's all about timing
I ain't going unless I'm flyin' in
Cause I got to make my entrance not to mention that all eyes on me
Got a lot of fam that I can't see strugglin'
So I spit it from the gut, makin' motherfuckas feel it in they stomach
I done said it before that I ain't got no time for frontin'
If they hate, I let them hate because I love it

[Hook]
G-R-I-N-D, (what) What's that spell? That's grind
I got money on my mind, yeah that's money on my mind uh
D-R-I-V-E, (what) What's that spell? That's drive
On a road to the riches, no you can't hitch a ride
Said you got to do your own thing, got to do your own thing
On a road to the riches homie tell me what you gone bring
Said you got to do your own thing, got to do your own thing
The grind never stops homie, what you waitin' for mane?

[Raz Fresco]
Uh, everybody want to rap, they don't know how the game is
How the pain is, they just trying to be famous
FA-ME lifestyle changes, need bread, need cake, sit dangerous
If your aimin', outside of the average, outside of my classes
Getting blunted, give a fuck what a teacher got to ask him
I'm wavy off this 40, ribs touchin' like they horny
Born at the bottom a nigga dreamed that I'm soaring
I ain't on but niggas think I am, think I have
Space for em, only got space for the Space Jam
Jordans I'm sportin', So I just hit that gas
Twist that grass as time pass as I steeze fresher
CD over my bed, that's my Native American dream catcher
You be Hefner, you hang with bitches
My main team be straigt G's, I'm not rapping I'm painting
You not rapping, you faking nigga
It cost to be the boss but you ain't payin' nothin'
I give it everything until I get somethin'
And when I say I'm grindin' man I ain't bluffin'
I'm heavy on my shit man

[Hook/Outro]
G-R-I-N-D, (what) What's that spell? That's grind
I got money on my mind, yeah that's money on my mind uh
D-R-I-V-E, (what) What's that spell? That's drive
On a road to the riches, no you can't hitch a ride
Said you got to do your own thing, got to do your own thing
On a road to the riches homie tell me what you gone bring
Said you got to do your own thing, got to do your own thing
The grind never stops homie, what you waitin' for mane?
