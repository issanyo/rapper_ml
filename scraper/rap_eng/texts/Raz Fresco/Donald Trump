[Intro]
We gettin' to it

[Hook - 2x]
Came through, laid it down
Turn it up, turn it up
Super hot, got the speakers
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Swear I got a lot, but I ain't
Got enough, got enough
Tryna' get it, til I'm on my
Donald Trump, Donald Trump [2x]

[Verse 1]
I went and took a dollar, and turned it to a stack
I live this fresh shit, you just spit it in your raps
I'm tryna' take the city, and put it on the map
And tell me what you feelin'
If you ain't feelin' that, she feelin' that
Good girl, she in church [?]
So I slapped her on the ass and she turned the other cheek
Uh, aye nigga peep game
And call me young Tom Clancy with that sneak game
[?] is colder than a ice cream parlor
Bet this Bathin' Ape shit leave your ass starstruck
Ninja, I'm doin' good like I'm supposed to
With my main chick, she belong on a poster
I tell her lay it on the floor like [?]
And I can care less if her heart attacks
Them broads see me and they start catchin' heart attack
Retro Air Jordans with the Starter cap

[Hook - 2x]
Came through, laid it down
Turn it up, turn it up
Super hot, got the speakers
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Swear I got a lot, but I ain't
Got enough, got enough
Tryna' get it, til I'm on my
Donald Trump, Donald Trump

[Verse 2]
So what you sayin'?
I was visualizin' how this would be back in my basement
Like it's goin' be amazing
In some Jordans, I be flossin'
And I can't even lie, my brother Shane put me on 'em
Baker's Club, from the start
And from the bottom to the top
Then my plan is [?]
And when I get to the top, kick a hole in a roof
Two hoes [?]
[?] to the floor
I spit here in the booth
[?]
I'm the truth, I deserve that loot
Look what I do, with that bomb flow
Dollars I'm gettin', all gold
So she start that convo, like, "Damn you went MIA"
No words spoken cause I'm rollin' up them MIAs
Playin' NBA 2k with my homeboy
Aye, so all that hate ain't hurtin' me
You know my steez flow, burn 'em til the 3rd degree
And these broads, I don't love 'em
I Donald Duck 'em, 'til a nigga Donald Trumpin'
Bakers Club

[Hook - 2x]
Came through, laid it down
Turn it up, turn it up
Super hot, got the speakers
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Swear I got a lot, but I ain't
Got enough, got enough
Tryna' get it, til I'm on my
Donald Trump, Donald Trump
