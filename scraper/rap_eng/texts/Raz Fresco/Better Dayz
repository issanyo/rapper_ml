VERSE 1:

I bake, ludicrous, my date, luminous
Niggas make foolishness, me i make exclusive shit
Bumpin dat biggavel, fucka dress Dave Chappelle
Niggas might hate it well, fuck em all burn in hell cuz

When my hearts sits, on them Ma’at scales
Father know i kept it real mother know i kept it real / cuz
God ain't a man or a woman its both i feel em
Sitting right beside as im writing my quotes and talkin

To my ancestors that protect me from ghosts / cuz i know
Heaven is a state of mind, not in the sky that means
Everyday single day i gotta walk thru hell i see the
Pregnant teen mothers on the bus by they self i won't

Sign shit, cuz they keep shit on the shelf and
CEO’s dont know about the struggle i felt, / they give a
Fuck about the people that im trying to help they tryna
Boost stocks, even if we all get shot forreal


HOOK:
We do it for the better days
Life gave me lemons i made lemonade
And never stopping cuz we one step away
From it all you know we want it all

Cuz you know, the sun meant to shine and
You know, mad pressure makes diamonds
The life, death, rebirth through the seed
That i plant in the Earth til then i soul search


VERSE 2:

Being
Real dont mean you kill niggas, or push soft and
Act hard, dat just means u real lost, the
Real know, its about the power of ya thoughts that
Motivate actions and how you come across so

If ya words bond, that bond it can't break
Hold it down for me, i b witchu always i judge a
Man by his moves and not by what he make / cuz
Mad fake niggas got gwap and got cake got

Whips and got chains up, but ain't doing shit but
Makin niggas more hungry for loot where they came up / ain't
Even hit puberty saggin and snatchin jewelery
Parents so disconnected at home they got immunity

This is to half-psychotic hydroponic smokin
Niggas smething melodic to get you through the winter with my
Winter Northface jacket looking like godzilla
Be afraid, bet the tree of life grow out my grave its like



HOOK:
We do it for the better days
Life gave me lemons i made lemonade
And never stopping cuz we one step away
From it all you know we want it all

Cuz you know, the sun meant to shine and
You know, mad pressure makes diamonds
The life, death, rebirth through the seed
That i plant in the Earth til then i soul search
