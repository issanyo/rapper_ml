[Intro]
I find music as a spiritual tool
All them people need to
Get a rich organisation
Give them more chance to live again

[Verse 1]
For life told me
Yo yo uh
We need scarface feelin some villains
With no feelings go places and go
Force for go getters leather benz interior
For the superior brazilian dime pieces for this
Elite hit strip strictly top shelf
Strictly for the club drop hope when I
Drop flow niggas need to stop drop
Roll I was on Eglinton scoop a rated patties
My chick from the west ain’t let me grab the fatty
Visions of fetty like dictators Will Chamberlin
Play your ball without the spalding
Dr doe mother OG no boning ace
Low key face facts blunts and OG
When I might grip her with the scissors
Lee Vines mr Mr ice lot off the white pipers
The fly fishes to me no other baken that got popped though
Mad buchala to convert the first two to a murcielago

[Outro]
Uh real smooth
It’s elegant
