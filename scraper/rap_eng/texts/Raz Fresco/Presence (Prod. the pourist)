[Intro: Raz Fresco]
*Clears Throat*
Bakers Club
Yeah
It's Pablo Uh

[Verse 1: Raz Fresco]
A-yo Deal with so much sometimes i need to relax
Imagine if we lived a thousand years At a slower pace

Watching flowers grow and rain would fall like tears
Watch the clouds float across the sky ? disappear

The buildings like concrete trees and cars like blood that flow through the veins of the streets I hear sounds like words i can recognize the pain in the beats

Memories activated every push of the key its seven notes on the scale of the sea they rather me thinking bout scaling the D then scaling a building

My album feel like first class seats when you hear it young one the one reason that they fearing

But the people online share it
Offline niggas listen to it get awareness
Institutionalized I'm finished
All my niggas simba we just scarred cause our parents got scars too reckless

[Chorus: PlvXid]
Real nigga since day 1 and I'm the same 1
Trill nigga since day 2 don't make me play you
Bill nigga since day 3 y'all niggas kill me
And 4 niggas in the back seat homie we so deep
You in the presence of a fucking real nigga, yeah (repeat)

[Verse 2: PlvXid]
Smell it in the air that puffmatic send a major shock to any nigga giving me static

Run for cover cause a youngin' wreaking havoc upon these weak MC's who swear they be getting next to me cause lyrically

Nigga I'm the next to be you get a  E for effort if these niggs testing me cause it's the microphone checka

The boom bap resurrecta'  here to resurrect ya read the script and get the lecture don't wanna test a Neo while inside the matrix

Nothing super fancy it's all just another day in the life of PlvXid feeling fantastic and everybody know I stay spitting acid

Sucka rappers getting trashed when I step on the mic gripping it tight within my possession cock it back like lethal weapons I take my aim then shoot you niggas know its PlvXid everytime i slay the booth ONE

[Chorus]
