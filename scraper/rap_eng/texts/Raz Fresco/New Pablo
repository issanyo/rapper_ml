Raz Fresco's Mom:
I was Sleeping, and when I was pregnant with you, I was spiritual
I use to have this storage room with flowers and water, and every morning-
And I use to go in there every morning to go pray because at that time I was
Seeking direction, and when I went to sleep the night, this lady appeared to me-
And this lady came to me and said your gonna have a boy, and his name shall be
R.A.S.Q.U.I.Z.... how much people you know have that name?

Bake flows, they say success make the hate show
