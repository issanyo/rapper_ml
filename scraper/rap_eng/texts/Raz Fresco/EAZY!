[Verse P. Blackk]
P. Blackk who dat, I'm fresh yup
Never follow packs I been on the trend set
Cold blooded, cold swag cold everything
Back for the second time but I'm killing everything
And I'm down for anything except for settling
Party and bullshitting, and drinking and smoking weed
My flow very mean, never back-peddling
Ain't nobody out this dope to my recent memory
You don't know, what you do is what you going to get
I'm on it, it's just the [?sceen?] offset
I got dreams that kind of seem farfetched
But I got mo' heat than Maurice Clarette
And I got what you need, I got all that all black
I ain't catching wreck, what you call that
I'm about to spaz out rap 'til my jaw snap
And it's nice to meet you but don't tell me ya'll rap
It's all in motion, momentum won't let me stop it uh
You rapping like you ain't trying to make a profit huh
You rapping like you already done got it all
Only to find out you lying and you ain't got it uh

Stop what you doing turn me up louder
Ain't no more bravery, everybody cowards
When did everything I'm doing turn into ours
P. Blackk, but you could call me black power though
Adios, 'P' how you do it bro
I don't know I don't go anywhere I don't feel comfortable
And I'm about to be in [all?] cities, dig me
Never met a nigga that's fucking... with me

[Verse 2 Raz Fresco]
It's A, B, C, D, E .... 'Z'
Skip every letter in-between cause I'm mean
As Idi rappers trash but I ain't gonna clean your city
Leave that to the garbage man
I'm the beat killer drum kicks become martyrs, damn
Did I say that, no I sprayed that
From the lyrical forty-five, blow your brain back
Raz, Jessie Owns on the race track running
She run the top when I go where she stay at
Keep it smooth, see why I call her wave cap
Not your little rap boy, [swipe?] boy
[Metallic?] [five?] steel ten's aluminum alloys
[Steaz?] running through my veins like this weed
When I'm puffing it
Times is money, hoes ain't on my budget
You love it how I look, like the [shit?] in my Jordan's
You look like a big piece of shit in some Jordan's
Big difference, yeah give me the life sentence
I'm kill shit until I die for my own sickness
Easily spit this, nothing like you
You nothing like me, you something like [fool?]
How many dopes lines can I fit in one song
Until this shit pops, that's what I'm trying to find out
As soon as I'm on the court, timeout
You gotta quadruple team me or it's too easy
Cause you know how I do, niggas claim that my [?] is well
I seen [?] niggas just want [?]
Baker's Club in it like a [Geno?]
Got this shit locked like a keystone
One hit kill, no reload
It's easy

[Hook]
