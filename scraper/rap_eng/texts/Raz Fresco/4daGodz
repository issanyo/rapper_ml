You know in order for capital to thrive
Certain groups of people have to be sacrificed
Because without a large, exploitable class of labour
There is no capital!

HOOK:
I wake up in the mornin, slide my jordan 9s on
How to get this money, always on my mind god
Make believe rappers, shining but they worthless
Maple leaf jersey chains layin on the surface, im

Caught up in europhia for ya
Caught up in this grindlife for us
Curse when i stroke when i love her
Cursed to b judged by my colour...


VERSE 1:
Niggas needa know we gods in the flesh
Yeshua ben's, kemites, cushites
Take the ring off her finger if she can't cook right
Cuz good pussy, dont guarantee a good wife

My steez captivating see me and dey look twice
Dat tell lie vision made my niggas lose sight cuz
Buddha looked like me, khrisna looked like me
Moses looked like me, jesus looked like me

They say colour dont matter then why they hide it then?
Under the vatican, away from the average man
Its cuz evil at the top of the throne, i
Built my home outta philosopher's stones, and

Lemurian crystals cover my floors and
Egyptian heiroglyphics on my doors and
Know thy self written on every board thats the
Foundation, u can't come in if u ain't knowing yo

So the new education is an education for power acquisition

- Frukwan - Its mathematics but its how u apply it?
Its certain things we need to open up our eyes to and understand whats going on

- Umar Johnson - Our children need to be taught Real Estate, the stock market, resource investment
Are you following me?

VERSE 2:
Whats the word, lettin time fly like a bird
A nigga well read like a nerd, eyes
Fixated on her curves, lost for words, yo
Kids running up to me like big worm yo

These girls crazy they never learn
Green skull when she died to many perms
..how these niggas make the pills 'fore the diagnosis
The same ones selling poison selling cures for it

But nevertheless we gotta move forward
And ride foreign, store weapons in the fortress
Why our heroes blood known to hug the pavements?
Its the federal bureau of investigations

True statements, world make me lose patience
Who fakin, fire bun em til they blazin
Yo.....i live by words dats ancient
.....i live by words dats ancient

Why was 2Pac Shakur murdered?
Because he was politicizing the gangs of L.A
For political work, because the crips and the bloods were
Founded by the Black Panther Party and were originally
Designed to do good, not harm, but they were infiltrated
By the F.B.I

- 2Pac - See the girl that did that rape shit, she hooked up
With the niggas that shot me

- Sanyika Shakur - oh is that right?

- 2Pac - It was all connected, it was a big plan, i just caught it
Like right at the end and thats why they shot me

- Sanyika Shakur- man we can't be having you not here you know what im saying

- 2Pac - I know thats what kills me
