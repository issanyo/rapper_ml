[WARNING SHOTS]

VERSE:
What good is it getting knowledge if the people ain't
Cuz if the people dont then shit'll be the same
The God rock ropes obese yo peep the chain
Heat the Jane then i peep the game let my speakers bang


... ....
So many lives lost over lie wars
Be a king nigga not a fool use your mind more
24/7 on my grizzy til my eyes sore

Be a queen pop that pussy for me when behind doors
Gotta learn bout the darkside so you shine more
Higher source, i just tap in so im fly of course
9z or 4z spit to wavy loops for Mercedez coupes

I play the couch play ya spouse out them daisy dukes
When I brainstorm shipwrecks on major routes
Many blacks strapped pack gats crack trading routes
Never seen nothing else they dont know what to do

Fast cash young make slow money look like baby food
Turn em to a beast like MJ in 82
Make some moves now the hotties with the fatties jockin
Analyzin rize now she mine panties dropping

Tantalize minds with the rhymes becky's bopping
Raz be the baker and my chick betty crockin
Bring the terror to em get ill Remy Ma shit
Mob chick, ride til the end no precautions

Flow razor sharp I slice with the Mics, Mikes
On my feet and i hold the Mic with a gauntlet
And the God never GaGa over blonde chicks
Kick that like KaKa on the offense

Ahh shit, word niggas living mad fiendish
They dont really think all they thoughts is sequenced
Frequencies hella low so they need this
Roll on niggas with the funk like speed stick

Ugh, feeling like I gotta win
Nowadays there be more corruption then the oxygen
And its in the oxygen and the religious documents
Long as we brain dead we living through the apocalypse

VERSE: every young black nigga is, wanted dead or alive, ugh
None of my cats got 9 lives..
I been the illest since 9-5..
They plotting on me plotting homicide... [wow]

Ugh, its cuz they infinite greed
Breed limitless schemes weaved intricately..
[wow]... so I dillinger thieve from the elite
Cuz they do it in the middle east

Triple steez flip cheese twin chain symmetry
Patent leather bred xi's my slang kickanese
99 percent of you niggas can't say shit to me
Raz got that muthafucking funk I spit that piffery

Its history, you chicken feet
Hickory dickory instantly when you see me coming with the wizardry
Big willie cats gotta suck dick sinfully
To get where im at I just puff shit simply

Rhyming like im inna mink coat
My LP slit throats
You cuff bimboes I put they face in the pillow
Foes crowd me but they gotta gold crown me
Hoes down me, blow maui, flow rowdy, lo ralphy, YES

I steps in it like a puddle, fuck it, fucka cuddle
Just because these bitches say they love you doesnt mean they love you
Heard that shit before, like a couple times, so i can't trust you
Motherfuck u, son, sun em got em screaming uncle.....
