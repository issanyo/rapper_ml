[Verse 1: Raz Fresco]

Love is understanding, hate is the opposite
Im the foundation, these woman get on top of it
Many seeds fell off the tree but one dominant
Look inside ya soul young god thats where the knowledge is

Ride to the ride to the ride til apocalypse
I ain't with the i ain't with i ain't with the politics if /
This my last breathe ima say something thats positive
..and let the light flow all thru ya consciousness

It was written on the tablets and the amulets
Yoo the sun shine natural can't polish this
Love ya curves baby got me risen like an obelisk / you
Look like a monument, document my astonishment

Did the 1 bypassed mad colleges
Dropout, dont ever fix ya lips like collagen
And say something when u gone end up apologing
A lotta cats confined in they confidence

Honestly, the rap game infinite
God supreme killing the false regimes kicking this
Ignorance, god they only care for they benefit
Im tryna touch every soul im existing with

And to do dat, my crew back with the bomb fire
Attack flow, gotta acknowledge who the champ rock the
Title belt, off the shoulder like spaghetti strap
Knowing these niggas scheming gotta b ready for dat

Machete the rap, enter the booth and empty the mac
Im freddy to cats, they worship wats on my pen and pad
Genocidal to fake niggas that dishonour the past
How long will i last, forever, the original man

Insidious land, young teens like yo simity sam
Burners like stove tops cookin the death inna pan/
Pan to the right shine like diamonds in the night
Drop a gem for the babies, cop the sl mercedez its the club

[Verse 2: ChillxWill]

Yo peep the baby blue Lex'
And the way that he be spitting out the navy Avirex
Polo Sport my chest
We army fatigued
Wear tennis shoes for speed
Slang dice, blow trees
It's all real in the battle field

I channel my energies
To catch the mass appeal
And drop the real
Cinematically dropped the reel
Now do you feel this
You tuned into life's illness, shit
I never knew what a blue pill is

It's mad pollution
Mass confusion, mind illusions
So I proceed to spread word while you niggas tuned in
Now who win
Win the godbody life forever
We rap what's real, you rap what's clever

I smash the lever to obsolete all ya future endeavors
And pack ya rhymes back in ya wack ass jetta
Now hit jacks
While the CLUB niggas kick facts
And you still wondering who's black
