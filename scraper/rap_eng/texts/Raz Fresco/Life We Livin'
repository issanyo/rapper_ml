[Intro]
It's Bakers Club bitch
Yea, Raz Fresco nigga
You feel me doe?
Just out here grindin'
Gotta get that money nigga
Yea

[Chorus]
Running to the 2 (yea)
All we do is grind (yea)
They tell me "slow down"
Cuz' I got time

But I'm still (still)
Getting everything that these niggas want
So I be the nigga that these bitches want

But I don't want them hoes back
I want mo stacks
And some mo stacks

But in the meantime
Where them hoes at?
Where them hoes at?
Where them hoes at?

[Verse 1]
It's paper over hoes, you should know the code
I go ham, go in, go overload
Black and White Jordan 6s, like piano keys
Hoes shootin' but (?) I dodge them like Keanu Reeves

Bakin' cake from sunshine to sunset
Got these young dimes gettin' undressed
Her boyfriend gettin' upset, call him up
I tell him he gon' need to find cop some stronger cups

I'm grinding to the sun on the other side
(?) cooler than them other guys
Bad bitches never trippin' they just wanna ride
Cuz' they know I'm fly

And they wanna fly wit' me in my plane
You ain't been where I'm finna go
They ain't touching me, kitchen stove

Cuz' they sleep while I'm wake in this session gettin' bread
Now they switchin' up they face, showin' expression, uh

[Chours}
Running to the 2 (yea)
All we do is grind (yea)
They tell me "slow down"
Cuz' I got time

But I'm still (still)
Getting everything that these niggas want
So I be the nigga that these bitches want

But I don't want them hoes back
I want mo stacks
And some mo stacks

But in the meantime
Where them hoes at?
Where them hoes at?
Where them hoes at?

[Verse 2]
Get it how you live nigga, don't stop
I spit crack, cookin' on a stove pot
My beats knock, in this thing, I'm on top
Flow hot, bad chick, exposed top

Niggas trash, swear they need a landfill
Paper chasin', so I never stand still
Ill flow, ad libs need Advil
Straight sun niggas, like Grant Hill

Doin' big big things, tryna stack bills
So these little (little) niggas need an ant hill
And these niggas lovin' my shit, got love for em'
People from all over puttin' all they niggas up

I'm this Raz Fresco, hoes callin' and textin'
I'm a super villian, y'all niggas henchmen
Tryna get French Blue 12s, F for french kiss
I don't spend time, I spend chips, bitch

[Chorus]
Running to the 2 (yea)
All we do is grind (yea)
They tell me "slow down"
Cuz' I got time

But I'm still (still)
Getting everything that these niggas want
So I be the nigga that these bitches want

But I don't want them hoes back
I want mo stacks
And some mo stacks

But in the meantime
Where them hoes at?
Where them hoes at?
Where them hoes at?

[Verse 3]
It's Bakers Club bitch but we cookin' money
Real recognize real, that's why they lookin' funny
I be illin' with some misses and they lookin' lovely

What you know about a nigga? You don't know nuffin'
No cuffin'
Slaughter House, Joe Budden
Niggas searchin' for they hoes, need a rose compass

Niggas ask if I had juice
I tell him, "I'm a chill nigga with my Jordan 8 straps loose"
Young nigga with my mind on a fast loop
So I keep a bad bitch like Papoose

But she'll never see a ring, you crazy?
I'm too fly to be tied down baby

Cuz' if you get cheese till you La-dy
Minus well with the cheese with the gra-vy
Cuz' when the skies gray like Macy
All them hoes gon' dash like Stacy, uh

[Chorus]
Running to the 2 (yea)
All we do is grind (yea)
They tell me "slow down"
Cuz' I got time

But I'm still (still)
Getting everything that these niggas want
So I be the nigga that these bitches want

But I don't want them hoes back
I want mo stacks
And some mo stacks

But in the meantime
Where them hoes at?
Where them hoes at?
Where them hoes at?

[Outro]
All we do is grind
Slow down cuz I got-, aye
Ayo shout out my niggas
Yea, It's Laced Up
Feel me doe
It's like... I'm just grindin' man real shit
Uh, feel me doe, uh
