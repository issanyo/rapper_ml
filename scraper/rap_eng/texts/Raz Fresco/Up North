[Intro]
Ah you know where I come from nigga yea yea uh
Let’s make this call in this mother fucker yea

[Verse 1]
I’m rolling this chair for my niggas that ain’t here
Put it in the air those other niggers
Where my niggas that ain’t here
Grinding in this game where my light years
But after that reset that because it’s my year
The Ralph Lauren jacket goes nice with the Nike Air
The night air stay cold and stay ten toes and turn nightmares
To the beat ya’ll where I put the G’s out
Freeze out after that bleed out redbone got a cellphone
Put a sneak out he out run like a ship when I beeped out
Niggas lived to the words that I speak out
Shoot box that’s puked out getting G’s now
Bring it back lay low undercover on the rebound
What for them face when you up they be down
Like you saw tracks killing put them in ER
Biggest club shit niggers know who we are

[Verse 2]
It’s the all mighty glorious incredible no replicas
We ain’t stars we be ballin nigga
Trick game the only knowledge they telling a nigga
Head knowledge they don’t want to develop my nigga
The screw face the more we getting it my nigga
In all colours like ball runners that’s all summer
And all winter 36 until we filthy as clubs in the
Inner city plays sticky blunt kushy fuck pussy
Young Jigger is where armed bitches wear hoodies
Got fire in my eyes and my hips Willy
Before the light it was dark fully ah yo

Young Jigger is where armed bitches wear hoodies
Got fire in my eyes and my hips Willy
Before the light it was dark fully ah yo

Too many fake women too many too many
Too many two face tamping too many bare hungry
Mother fucker trying to get some bread crumbs

But that’s just how it goes in the life that I chose
Hey yo don’t get shit confused you should Already know it

Hoes and bitches posing laughing fronting
And they smiling so convincing trying to

Souls we lifting dope nigga home and
Sense you more mind everyday cause

But that’s only why I change my mind
Where my home is where their soul is
Soulless is hopeless up north niggas

Cut dope shit cut gun shit
Niggas only give a fuck about their own shit
Cut dope shit cut gun shit

Then tell you this is a game you will see nigga watch
It’s an everyday thing niggas drew for the jackpot
Mislead for the come up you all scream come up

Wanting to grow up and be kings while G’s

Too many fake women too many too many
Too many two face tamping too many bare hungry
