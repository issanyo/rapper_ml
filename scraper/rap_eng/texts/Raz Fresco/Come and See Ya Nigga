[Intro]

I need you to need me I need you to feel me
For real G I need your love need the dog till
I’m filthy and why you think I put my time in this
Why you think I put my life in this and rhyme
Vicious cause this is the way of poverty and
Lack of paper so many niggas counting on me
Calling me calculator how do you calculate the
Pressure on my shoulder every time I write a
Tune up it’s like I’m writing the future
On my way to the show trying to get paid now
Grind life lifestyle the more people feel me is
The more I fly out the more I fly out
The more opportunity comes down to me and
You that’s why I reflect love when it’s given
Cause you ain't guaranteed to get it remember
That I said it and when I’m in your city these

[Verse 2]
You use to be happy when I called but now a days
The ringer off and you don’t pick up and if we do
Talk it’s about how we never talk and how you
Never thought I would be the one to perceive yuh
You say Raz I can’t see you so when I’m at the
Crib with my feet up it’s kinda empty in the cell
Phone tempt me and hit you up like yo yo why
Don’t you come and see a nigga but my words
Like the wind now it’s impossible to win now
Cause you drowning in doubts afraid of how it’s
Going to end out so you back out disappear and
Trying to see a nigga I was just trying to be there
For you drop dance try to care for you I even told
You that I care for you but you assuming I’m
Disloyal and this is the self before I destroy you
I do my best but you say I don’t do shit for you
And make the blood boil you cause you don’t
Believe me that this thing we got I’m trying to
Keep it with you use to tell me that you need a
Nigga so why don’t you come and see a nigga

Look we use to just sit and talk about Jordans
Now we all trying to ball like Jordan Uh and the
Money so important got to get this so we spread
This so we spread this out disconnect it and
I’m just trying to see us go for in this life push
Fly whops and reminisce on how we stole bikes
When we was young we would hold mikes
Now I get paid to hold mikes and niggas
Thinking that I’m busy because I seek ends
But sometimes a nigga just needs friends
Plus this rap shit got niggas scheming on me
They want to smoke to get the CD on me a
Feature on me I miss chilling out and just
Speak to homies I’m trying to keep my homies
I’m also trying to rise up elevate minds till
