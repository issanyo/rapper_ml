This goes out to all y'all tellin' my bitch what you saw

(1st Verse: Kurupt)
Early mornin'

Just took a sip and just took a smoke
The phone rang
Niggas spittin' game
The same ol'
Same ol'
Same ol' thang
Talkin' 'bout life
Talkin' 'bout bitches
Talkin' 'bout money...
Cars...
And switches
And all of a sudden he switched talkin' about some kill shit
'Bout this bitch ass nigga talkin' some real shit

(Chorus)
This goes out to all y'all tellin' my bitch what you saw
Hell naw I can't let that sliiiide!
Thinkin' I won't check shit or these mouths on records

You know I'm chip-toothed, motherfucker

(3rd Verse: Roscoe)
If you gonna rob with us, nigga rooob!

Explicit, and R-Rated
You askin' why I'm laughing cause it's kinda funny to me
You really think you gonna come and take my money from me?
