Yeah
Yeah, that's wassup

You say you wanna roll (with me that's wassup)
And I'mma beat it down (until you've had enough)
But still it's only for tonight (so let's make it fun)
Girl I gotta catch a flight (when the morning comes)

You know it's only ever so often I get to get away and relax
So it's important when I call for you to come and [?]
It's been a while since I've been in town
I got a hectic schedule and I get around
But every time I touch down and we get together
The anticipation and waiting always make it better
Imagination of you and me, having relations
Until the floorboards rise, look me in my eyes
Hypnotized by your hips and thighs
Your lips and your size
Wanna tear it out the frame right in front of the guys
But they gonna bounce in minute, then it's on
Time to finish what we started last time we got the bone
Getting busy to the fifth degree
Now how many licks does it take to get to the centre? You tell me
But don't be mad at me if you wake up all alone, and I'm already gone
I'll be back baby all you gotta do is listen for the phone

You say you wanna roll (with me that's wassup)
And I'mma beat it down (until you've had enough)
But still it's only for tonight (so let's make it fun)

Girl nobody do it better than me
But you already knew
Still I gotta handle my business and keep my revenue
Gotta catch a plane but I'll be back soon
Believe that (believe that)
We can get back and resume the beat that (beat that)
But you can't be stressing be, either
I hate it when you blow me up, stressing my beeper
All you gotta do is wait and let it marinate
A little patience is all it takes
Until I'm gone, baby hit the brakes
I travel state to state and country to country
Can't come and see you every time you want me
But when I do call lady work your while
I'll get you open like a woman giving birth to child
Don't be frontin' if I bone out
Relax baby, don't I always come back baby?
To dry your eyes
And I'm gonna miss you but it's time to go
Gotta catch a plane in 20 minutes
Baby

Me and the homies had a show do to in Reno
After the concert we went to the casino
Security was deep so I had to creep through
That's when I peeped you in your black see-through
Me and Gotti 'bout to bounce out the back-way
That's when I noticed something that made me walk that way
Something about the way you guzzle in that alazay
Straight out the bottle but you looking like a supermodel
You bounce with me and we got a couple six-packs
And then we dip back to the room and kit-kat, and chit-chat
One thing led to another
Next thing I know, we couldn't keep our hands off each other
All on the floor, out of control
'Do not disturb' sign on the door
You tellin' me it's on ma, but I already know
And to be honest, it's good but I don't want it though
I only want it for tonight
Girl

You already know wassup man
You know how I get down
We've been doing this for a long time
It's not a game
That's just the way it's gonna be
Deal with it
Bitch
