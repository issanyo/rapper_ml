[Intro]
Roscoe and Ray J
West coast
It's Roscoe and Ray J

[Chorus: Ray J]
All of my ladies in the place
Let me see you move your waist
Me and my niggas off the haze
'Stal, Hypnotiz and Alizé
Ten more bottles on the way
Things are about to get started
This is what I call a party
With me and my niggas 'round the way

[Verse 1: Roscoe]
Grand and Absolut, ten khaki suits
Brand new Caddy coupe, it's Grandaddy Youth
Who goin' Philly for Philly with the fanatic
I'm a killer, reppin' the iller, spillin' for skrilla
Take a whiff of this, bomb odoriforous
California Mary cloudy, aroma therapy
She down temporarily, for now, momentarily
But she could be permanent, look how good she workin' it

[Verse 2: Ray J]
Now baby you're lookin' good to me
After the party, you and me up in my Jeep
Beep, here we go again, gettin' it poppin'
Front, back, side to side, ain't no stoppin'

[Refrain: Ray J]
Baby you got the truck hoppin'
Off in the club with the beat knockin'
What? When? Drinkin' san gin
Make sure you leave your number and we'll do it again

[Verse 3: Roscoe]
Scoedizzle, yobrizzle, blowdizzle
So vicious, snowjizzle, real talk, no lie
So high, still spark a drojizzle
Roll by blowin' sizzles, blowin' missiles, Scoe and Bizzle
Ray Jizzle, Scoedy Mac, shorty mad
She shake jizzle, but look how shorty act, shorty wack
Forty sacks, forty bottles, forty models, show the models
Sure to follow, sure to gobble, sure to swallow, sure to holla

[Chorus: Ray J]
All of my ladies in the place
Let me see you move your waist
Me and my niggas off the haze
'Stal, Hypnotiz and Alizé
Ten more bottles on the way
Things are about to get started
This is what I call a party
With me and my niggas 'round the way

[Refrain: Ray J]
Baby you got the truck hoppin'
Off in the club with the beat knockin'
What? When? Drinkin' san gin
Make sure you leave your number and we'll do it again
