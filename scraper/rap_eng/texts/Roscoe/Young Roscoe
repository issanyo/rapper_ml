[Roscoe]
Young Roscoe, that's my name
I ain't no joke, I got a roscoe
Bustin' on lames to get the scrilla nigga
Roscoe, see me in traffic causin' static with my roscoe
Who that lil' nigga wreakin' havoc?, Young Roscoe

I battle niggas with my head up high
Shorty make it pop with your legs up high, breasts, thighs
Let me get your number, let me get your bing
Every brizzle on the scene screamin' in my limousine
"Ooh, aah", 'Scoe Dizzle too fly
Fools wanna bruise, die - I'm the one that cruise by
Young with the ill flow and everybody know (who that?)
Young Roscoe Tabasco Desoto
I love it when they jiggle it like Jell-O
Scodie get the brizzle's to wiggle it like ("hello!")
Why do we die?, hammers to the sky
Roll it up, now we smoke-smoke-smoke it (c'mon)
(Show me love) When you see me pass by, don't trip
(Show me love) If I ask you to strip, don't trip
20 inches on my ride, my hat tilted to the side
Chickenhead's wonder who am I, c'mon

I made 'em all pause
Now it's time to make a move with some new shhh
(Young Roscoe)
Tabasco, Philly Philmatic with the hot flow
But y'all don't hear me though

[Roscoe]
My area of expertise - auto thief
Camaro's, Lex's, Jeep's
Excursion XL with the extra seats
Nigga please, what you mean?
Them just my play cars
I hit the block pushin' that XKR
I hopped out thuggin', chick's jock, way hard
I make 'em jot notes while I sleep through class
My teacher can't stand that I always pass
Sharp with the flow, like darts with the flow
Chop heads like martial arts with the flow
The Bruce Lee of rap with a deuce and a mack
I just copped my first Coupe and a Jag'
Scoe is loco and everybody know that
Cause I show at every show toe'd back
Chemically imbalanced, takin' Prozac
Blow sacks of the bomb, prime, bustin' dope raps

Who that lil' nigga wreakin' havoc?, Young Roscoe

I'm sick like AIDS, twisted like braids
In the cut like fades, I interrupts like rage
I'm quick to untuck and bust my gauge
I don't look, act, or fuck my age
A pitbull wit it, grippin' your jaws wit it, and chick drool wit it
And they go bananas out at the Y.A. mansion, I'm swimmin' pool wit it
Too sexy for the High, I'm homeschool wit it
Chrome tool wit it, shorty loc'd out
I roll up smoked out, hundred spoked out
And once a week I take all my folks out
And every weekend I take my loc's out
