Because I'm rappin till my throat soar
Cuz I got a lot of things to get up off my chest
I feel like I'm drownin, in a pool of stress
And I'm feelin like I ain't got that much time left
Sometimes I dream about death, but doesn't everybody?
That's what I tell myself at night so I can fall asleep
It's like I dug another ditch but this one too deep
The rope's danglin from the top and I'm too lazy to reach
It might be easier for me to see the rights from the wrong
If it wasn't *edited* on enough to open his eye
We been fed up for the longest, and now we ride
My thoughts creepin through the window at sunri(se)
A bullet flies through the air with no name on it
The same bullet took my homeboy Avery's life
I pray to God that my dear friend would live that night
But he died, and since then I ain't been livin right
I'm comin home with straight F's *edited* in every class
My momma cryin cuz she see her youngest son is a thug
Wakin up in cold sweats, filled my body with slugs
Nightmares and shootouts, keepin me awake
Don't be amazed when you see me with a .38
I'm all alone with a dozen heaters all loaded
I'm poor all I see is guns, explodin
Gotta itchy trigger finger and I can't hold it, unloaded

We ridaz comin from the slums
With our guns out lookin for a better life
A better way, strugglin to make it through the night
Stare at my AK, dreamin of a brighter day
I'm in the shade, tryna step over into the light
Gettin paid off this rap game, who would've thought?
My back's up against the wall now it's on court
Pull out my 9 and start bustin just like I was taught
Cuz I was born to ride

Sellin *edited* in the rain with my homie Ice
Fist fights over dice, we ain't nothin nice
If you thinkin you could brawl fool, bring the drama
Think about all of the pain that I caused my momma
She never want me around, she said I'm hopeless
Twisted in the basement, hittin roaches
Press the heat to my dome but I can't pull it
But knowin I could stop the pain with a single bullet
A young thug tryna make it to see 21
A difficult task, not everyone could get it done
Bust out all the street lights so they can't see me
They already hate a *nigga* cuz they heard the c.d
I'm bout to run up in the precint and spray a round
I'm in a situation, gotta lay 'em down
I never hide, only ride for the homicide
*edited* and the Dogg Pound when he draw down
Thug till I pass away, that's a Y.A
Baby Glock in my sock that's how I play
We grew up hard in the gutter, me and my brother
For 13 whole years couldn't see each other
I'm bout to bang out on the curb cuz I'm feelin buzzed
A westcoast G, but I'm still a Philly thug
With AK's for the first *nigga* comin this way
I was born to ride

We ridaz comin from the slums
With our guns out lookin for a better life
A better way, strugglin to make it through the night
Stare at my AK, dreamin of a brighter day
I'm in the shade, tryna step over into the light
Gettin paid off this rap game, who would've thought?
My back's up against the wall now it's on court
Pull out my 9 and start bustin just like I was taught
Cuz I was born to ride
I was born to ride

And every gets worse it'll never change
Little kids dyin, daddy's stuck in the game
I'm at the point of no return, can you please help me?
I'm only tryna put some food in a *nigga* belly
You got me all messed up, homie, look again
16 years old burryin my friends
So what do you expect to hear in these present years?
And nowadays no one knows any other way
My poppa told me it's another way for me to do it
But his method didn't work now I'm through with it
Prepared for the funeral of the juvenile
I might be dead right now if I ain't had a crew
No one expected the truth to come from a youth
Chipped my front tooth boxin up on the roof
An everyday somebody die don't nobody cry
You thought my lyrics so explicit, this is how I live it
Smokin weed, drinkin brews, thuggin on the block
Stay true and on the run from the school cops
Parents complainin bout my rap, say they want me (to) stop
Well y'all ain't help ya *niggas* right here on the block
So truthfully I don't care if you approve or not
Cuz I was born to ride
