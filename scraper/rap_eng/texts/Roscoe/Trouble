Alright lets do this
Yeah J-Weezy Bozzy J Well
Yeah
Young Sco Cal Holmes
We about to do it real big
Take it somewhere we ain't never took it to before
Outside

[Verse 1: Roscoe]
I just rolled up in my Benzo
I just rolled up some of that you-know
I just popped out of nowhere like whaddaya-know
And I ain't going nowhere you know
Y'all don't know half of my scenario
I got niggas all up in my cereal
And don't know if its Applejacks or Cheerios
Y'all don't hear me though
It ain't no clothes in your ear to scope
See I just took over your stereo
18 year old college material
Putting Philly on the map, philly on my cap
The imperial superior
And all the skirts wanna give it to Sco
Till these shirts mini skirts wanna give it to Sco
Stick works skinny work
But I'd rather have a fatter
If she pay 'em like she weigh 'em give it to Sco

[Chorus: Roscoe] 2x
See me and my crew ain't- nothing but trouble
And we be coming through like- nothing but trouble
And niggas tell us we ain't- nothing but trouble
Especially me I ain't- nothing but trouble

[Verse 2: Roscoe]
Yeah Philly in the house, Philly in this mount
Fitted on perfect, vest on the surface
I did it on purpose, fresh out the circus
I spit it so murderous, I'm crazy
Going through a tough time, got me sippin' JD
Seeing in 3-D, see me in a G3
Coastin postin roast it toast it off
E & J G & J
I hit the VMAs with THC
All in my DNA I'm B-A-D
To the bone with the chrome
Once again its on
Club hoppin' once we in the zone
We gonna BLAZE, GUZZLE, RAY, BUBBLE, SHIZZLE
Misbehave and start trouble
SPARK, CHUG, BARK, BUZZ
Dippin smashin' Y-A'in it up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Roscoe]
I rock the party that rocks the body
Me Young Gotti we rock the party
Now we all in the cleezy no ideezy
Young Sco Gotti help me somebody
High loaded fly molded
Fry floatin' shining glowing
Signing flowing rising blowing
Crackin' poppin' stackin' dropping
Platinum product alive in your ride up
For all my survivors and riders
We gets wasted faded
Nice today enough for the rest of the night
Triple XT but my vest just right
Tech to my right with my neck full of ice
I'ma link up with you later, aight?
Take it or leave it I'm a playa for life

[Chorus]
