[Intro]
Hella fly, never die, got these niggas mad at me
Bet I'm high, open wide, this is what you gotta see
I'ma ride 'til I die, man, that's how it gotta be
Test my side, bullets fly (Bullets fly, bullets fly)

[Verse 1]
Burn out, turn out the track in the dope house
It's sittin' in my rearview, clear view, I steered through
'Cause niggas over here, way realer than they appear, too
Hit some little kids, this is enough to kill you
'Cause I know the value of a hundred dollar bill, dude
Put it on your head forever, 'til it mildew
Body shots to the body, rah, it'll still do
That bitch jam, pop it, I'll let it rot, it'll still shoot
Nigga say he gon' kill you? Tell me what you will do
I'ma pop in broad day while channel five film, cool
Certified real dude, paint a picture, let it ride
Forty-five, grip 'em right, I ain't fuckin' with ya
It's a new day, gimme your bitch, I'm the new Uday
Live life like ain't no nigga gonna shoot me
Fear none 'til it's doomsday, I get my uzi fully, who rang?
Tough talkin' 'til I show 'em you a pussy, it's the bootleg

[Verse 2]
It's goin' down, mayday, I grind hard for my payday
Keep-keep it movin' like a freight train
My circle full of that AK, big bosses, Great Danes
I'll hit your ass with this great aim
Slugs penetrate, it cause great pain
When you fuck with mine, it's hard to maintain
I'ma ride while I switch lanes
Keep the hundred, never bitchmade
I roll with a circle that itch, nay
We doin' this work to get rich-made
I'm leavin' his life in a ditch, mayne
All in the booth with your bitch, ayy
She gimme more cut than a switchblade
(Gimme more cut than a switchblade?)
Can't pass that, where the cash at?
S-E-B-B, we mash that
V-B-G, know where the stash at
Talk that shit, get your ass cracked
Stack more paper than Afflac
Tot a bad bitch with a fat back
Bet I beat that up 'til the ass flat
You know two puff then you pass that
Got the fire rolled, light a match, stat
If you smoke, where your sack at?
Get it poppin', where the 'gnac at?
Dominatin' like Shaq's back
It's not where you from, it's what you makin'
Dedication, I don't lack that
They talkin' shit and I hear 'em talkin'
I got a full clip that go, "Rat-tat", uh-huh

[Chorus]
Hella fly, never die, got these niggas mad at me
Bet I'm high, open wide, this is what you gotta see
I'ma ride 'til I die, man, that's how it gotta be
Test my side, bullets fly, just another casualty
Another casualty, another casualty, casualty
Another casualty, another casualty, casualty
Another casualty, another casualty, casualty
I'ma ride 'til I die, man, that's how it gotta be

[Verse 3]
Turn up, turn up, turn up
Four zips in the whip get burnt up
Four clips on my hip, you trip on my clique
Click-boom, you gon' get murdered, swaggin'
Fully auto action for everybody that's askin'
The MAC rippin' you flacid, now that shit was classic
Now turn up, turn up, turn up
Four bricks in the whip I'm servin'
Your bitch in the whip, not to blow my dick
But to hold my bricks while I get my chips
I'm on six hundred
Four-fifty on the kit, let 'em load my wrist
And the opp-ers get murdered
Yeah, the opp-ers get murdered
Os on my clothes, got a stack of 5-0s
Through lines on my squirr, get served
Now go and get courage
I'll pop two Percs and it's curtains
I hope you have insurance
Don't want your mama to get no burden
Since you was sellin' birds, bitch
I hope that it was workin'
And one thing that's for certain
Ain't no perpin' when workin'
And I just got me ten squirrs
I guess suppliers and workers
I stunt on niggas who hatin'
So pull your skirt up and skirt 'em
And I'm one of the realest niggas you not gonna murder

[Verse 4]
BK, heatmaker when the beat plays
Tryna regain his peak fame when he sprays
Always a top three place in each race
The rested is D and has no b-rain
You see, Cain's been chasin' a dream state
Since a teenager, been for big for his rename
No rapper stoppin' me, I'm poppin' 'til I'm off again
I feel like a king, all I need is a free way
I'ma write 'til the reaper finds me
My thought's so deep that the Greek Poseidon
Go down into the sea and find it
All sorts of my creatures hidin'
Better meet the sirens
No one can ever see or try to follow me
The Greek mythology would tell you, "He's your highness"
While my eagle eyes sweeps seas and rises
For the perfect section for my team's arrivin'
So we be ridin'

[Verse 4]
Pistol whip this nigga
Talkin' out his neck (Yeah)
Beat 'em like the slavery days
And break the Django out his neck
Robbin' just to feed my family
So they can rest assured
If I catch a nigga snitchin'
I'ma hang 'em by his vocal cords (Ahh) (Let's go!)
These niggas tryna kill me
But if you kill him, that's four G gone (Yeah)
Put a checkmark on a nigga's head
Call Verizon 4G
I watch who I keep around me
Since my own brother tried robbin' me
This rap shit is my outlet
And I dare y'all pigs, try to charge me

[Verse 5]
Red eye through the sky, private jet flow
Fly from the runway, high from the get go
When that fire from the gun spray
Die if you don't get low
You hate my content
But you love the way I spit, though
These niggas really wanna get rolled up
Like dice, nigga, what they hittin' for?
Fold that ass up real nice
Mills Lane, let's get it on
Break 'em off proper, proper
Break 'em off proper, proper
Cock back the chopper
It go, "Block-block-block-block-block-block-block"
Yeah, I'm just bein' so realistic
So realistic, No doubt about it, bitch
I'm chauvinistic, chauvinistic
And ain't no doubt, bitch, in your mouth
That's where I'm shovin' this dick, shovin' this dick
And it ain't no doubt when it all go down
She gon' be lovin' this dick, lovin' this dick
Hahahaha
Tomorrow mornin' she'll be mad at me
Me, automatically, just another casualty
No limit when I'm in it, that's that master D (D)
Hahahaha, then I'ma slide off casually

[Chorus]
Hella fly, never die, got these niggas mad at me
Bet I'm high, open wide, this is what you gotta see
I'ma ride 'til I die, man, that's how it gotta be
Test my side, bullets fly, just another casualty
Another casualty, another casualty, casualty
Another casualty, another casualty, casualty
Another casualty, another casualty, casualty
I'ma ride 'til I die, man, that's how it gotta be

[Verse 6]
Mac Lucci on the grind, that's just how I gotta be
Bawdy, filled with dollar signs like I hit the lottery
If my baby's gotta eat it's gon' be a robbery
They be like, "Who did it?" That young thug nigga from the B-B-G
You squares are Rubik's, keep it real how I do this
True pimp 'cause the shoe fit, I ain't even want the bitch
But when I spoke, she dipped, go in on my grill like a toothpick
She chose up, twenty K on my wrist when I roll up
Fifteen on my neck, shit froze up
Make a player hater sick that I blow up
Roll up, OG homie we throw up
Low key that mean we tore up
When I hit it from the back, she slow up
Slow motion for me, bitch I think I'm Juvenile
Been gettin' cash money since a juvenile
Middle finger to a buster, fuck what you got to say
Million dollars in the safe, bitch I think I'm Dr. Dre
Send them birdies OT my new Beamer need some gas
Bring my moolah back fast or they'll get it out your ass

[Verse 7]
Car start, thirty ozone
Big dawg with a big bite, Cain, course I'm
Holes through your torso
Panamera Porsche
Fishscale, coca√≠na, call 'em air forces
Gardena, Compton, LA, Chiraq
Fly me in and out of town, I'll be right back
Sack full of OG, smoke that holy moly
I ain't flexin', but my wrist hold the coldest Rolly
Rep my city big, Crenshaw the fig
Shout out to my little brodie, what up Dirt Diggs?
Bitches off that Tunechi, I'm built to brawl with lucci
Two Gs on my belt, so you know I'm Gucci
I don't pay for Coogi, thots, ratchets, groupies
Fuck with bitches in the Benzes, not the hoes with hoopties
Westbound, I'm branded, apartments to mansions
Big Doty the stage killer, Charlie Manson
