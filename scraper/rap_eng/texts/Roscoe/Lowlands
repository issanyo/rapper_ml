When the feelings rise
I don't feel nothing
Other than the lies
Of my soul dying
Haven't you been blinded
By the hope you put in me?
Haven't you been blinded
By the life you put in me?

It's a shame, you're all but clever
In the light of the words you're trying to say!
But the sign outside is clearer
You're the loss of every step I made!

When our souls collide
I assume we're missing
Something I can't hide
Please save it for me
How can I be proud
Of the cracks you found in me?
How can I be proud
Of all this sh*t you found in me?
