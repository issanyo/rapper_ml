[Ben Ross]
Well well
Once again it's your announcer
B-Down
Taking you on a journey from the flatlands of Oaktown
To the rolling hills of Fremont, and beyond

It’s during this trip, during this journey
You'll be transported
Taken on a ride to a world in which
Only true macks and OGs exist
To a spot where only one man can rule
Or reign superior

It's in this place that dwells one of the truest of macks
A street soldier, definitely on a mission
A mission that many had believed to be impossible to repeat
Yeah

But now’s the time that we release a brand new funk
A funk that can only be brought to the forefront by a true player
A king of the mack daddies
The ultimate OG
Hammer, the Funky Headhunter

[Hammer]
Yo wassup baby boy yeah
The Hammer's definitely in the house
I'm returning to claim the fame, the funk, and the true mackin', yeah
So all you wannabe roughnecks and wannabe macks
Hahaha
Stick yourselves, yeah

I heard everything you said
Hammer this, Hammer that
Yeah, I heard all that, it's all good
But I'm to break you off somethin' real proper

So make room for the Funky Headhunter
Or better yet, don't make room
Ima take mine
I took everything from you anyway, yeah
Twenty-five million records, twenty countries
And got love from a hundred million
You know you can’t fade it, hahaha

And now, Ima do it like this, yes
Like this
