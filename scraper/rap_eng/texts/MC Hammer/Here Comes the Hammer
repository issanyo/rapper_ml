Uh-oh, uh-oh (Here comes the Hammer!)

[MC Hammer]
Yes, this is a mission, that I'm on
Takin out the weak on the microphone
I'm hype -- so don't talk
About the hard hittin Hammer, when you can't even walk
On the STAGE -- after me
And if you do, yo, a catastrophe
Happens -- just like that
I rock 'em all from white to black
OH, OH, OH - BUST IT!

Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo
Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo
Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo
Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo

[MC Hammer]
"Naw, NAW!" -- is what I said
When I came to see a show
I looked and it was dead, DEAD!! -- y'know!
Like a body in the ground, will your show ever grow?
Let me know -- if not
Then close yo' mouth because you sho' ain't hot
It needs WORK! -- like a car in a wreck
They call me Hammer, you gotta earn my respect
OH, OH, OH - Yeah!

Yeah! Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)

BUST IT! - I don't hesitate -- or wait
Before the bell rings, I'm out the gate
And rollin, out for mine
Workin so hard for such a long time
In life, it's here and gone
So (PEDAL TO THE HAMMER) while I'm watchin the throne
Not a king, just feelin hype
You dance to the music while I'm on the mic
OH, OH, OH - Here we go!

BUST IT! - A minute or two, now I'm rollin
A whole new style that the people are holdin
ON -- TO
I move, I groove, I rap, you're through
You're so plain -- just plain
Your ego so big, that you missed the whole train
A-GAIN, my friend
The people wanted more, that's why the Hammer's in
OH, OH, OH - Yeah!
