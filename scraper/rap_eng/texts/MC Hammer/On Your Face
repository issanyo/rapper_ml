Ain't it funny that the way you feel, shows on your face
And no matter, how you try to hide it'll state your case
Now a frown will bring your sprits down to the ground
And never let you see, the good things all around
Everytime we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck run out and the wind won't blow

But that can't make me sad, just can't make me
Whoa, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
The world can't take me, won't let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race, keep a smilin' face
Help you set your pace

Wish upon a sunny day, it'll turn to rain
Use the sunshine in your heart to ease the pain
We wonder how your attitude is going down
Is it wakin' and shakin' and safe and sound'
Every time we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck runs out and the wind won't blow

But that can't make me sad, that can't make me
Whoa, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
The world can't take me, won't let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race, keep a smilin' face
Life is on your case

Yes it is, yeah
This world can't shake me, bad times can't make me sad
Whoa, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
The world can't take me, won't let it drive me mad

You can't shake me the way I feel today
Come tomorrow I'll feel the same ol' way
Ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
Wake me! My heart is feelin' glad
I'll take you with me when you're feelin' bad
Use the sunshine in your heart

You can't shake me the way I feel today
Come tomorrow I'll feel the same ol' way
I start to wonder what's going down, gotta feel it, feel it
Wake me! My heart is feeling glad
I'll take you with me when you're feelin' bad

I start to wonder what's going down
In your life, is it safe and sound'
I start to wonder if your life's all right
Are you dealing with it everyday or does it cause you strife?
Yeah
