[Hook]
That's the fire, that's the fire, that's the fire, what
That's the fire, that's the fire, that's the fire, what
That's the fire, that's the fire, that's the fire, what
That's the fire, that's the fire, that's the fire, what
Better run, better run run
Better run, better run run, let's go there
Let's go there

[Verse 1]
Let's go where the lights is hot
Where a rapper gotta back up all the shit he pop
Let's go there, the game is so cold
I could see it in his eyes, the boy sold his soul
Devil said "I'ma give you the world"
"I'll take it, plus give me a girl
Mr. Devil, can you give me a sign?"
He said "Throw the Roc up, thats one of mine"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo Jay, I got a reason to doubt
If I knocked on your door would you come on out?
If I knocked on your door that mean I'm knocking you out
If I knocked on your door boy, I'll bust ya in ya mouth
Uh, see me, son, I don't play
I come from the shoulders, that's two the hard way
New rules, let me show you the way
If a rapper talk tough, he gotta back up what he say

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I don't really have to go in on a fella
But that dude wrote back to devil
Nah nah, I don't rock your wear
Your shoes, I don't need a dark pair
That boy tried to steal my swag
Fingerprints all over the bag
Imposter, get him outta here
Imposter, the king is right here, lets go

[Hook]

Yeah you're now rocking with the king of heart
The king of heart, tearing all imposters apart
