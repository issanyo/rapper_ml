You can't touch this, you can't touch this
You can't touch this, you can't touch this
You can't touch this

My, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say, "Oh my Lord"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet

It feels good when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oak Town
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you homeboy
(You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we living and you know
(You can't touch this)

Look at my eyes, man
(You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics
(You can't touch this)

Fresh new kicks, advance
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat

While it's rolling, hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that, like that cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

Yo, I told you
(You can't touch this)
Why you standing there, man?
(You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucka
(You can't touch this)

Give me a song or rhythm
Make 'em sweat, that's what I'm giving 'em
Now, they know
You talking about the Hammer you talking about a show

That's hype, and tight
Singers are sweating so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
