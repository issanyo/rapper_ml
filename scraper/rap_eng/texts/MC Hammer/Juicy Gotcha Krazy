Cold goin’ mad

[Verse 1]
You know I’m fly
You can’t deny
You wanna try
I’ll tell you why

He’s on his knees
He cops a plea
He wanna get
A piece of me

We on a roll
Not on a stroll
3-5-7
Our records are gold

Grab a hold
Of what you owe
3-5-7
Has stole the show

I was kickin'
Just go tippin'
Trippin . . . right

He’s a vulture
Not a soldier
Suckin' for life

Get off my tip
Don’t give me a lip
You sucker MCs
Get pistol whipped

He lost his mind
For the very first time
Just a little bit of juice
Keeps him in line

I [?]
He don’t mess up
Come on boy
It’s time you 'fess up

The juice is it
It keeps you lit
From head to toe
This stuff is legit
No need to fake it
You can’t take it

Don’t get no juice
Boy you won’t make it

He amaze me
[?]
Yeah he blames me
If he left
It wouldn’t phase me

He just paid me
Cuz he craves me
Paid for the juice
Didn’t get no cherry

Keep it workin’
He ain’t jerkin’
His money is mine
The juice is lurkin’

Waitin’
Contemplatin’
'bout the move
I’m gonna make

He is flipped
He is whipped
This juice is checkmate

I know I got him
So I work at keepin’ him fit
Like a horse when I ride
He knows where I sit

Bust it
Let’s discuss it (yeah)

Fly girls getting served
Cuz the juice is so prime (yeah)

Bust this

Baby let me tell you
Cuz I think you should know
When I step out my ride
You better open my door

I might get ill
That’s how i feel
I wanna get pleased
But you ain’t real

You just tease me
You don’t please me
Talk real big
Then you sleep easy

Make him like the noise
Like the women i know
Juice him good
Now he can’t let go

He follows me
He bothers me
His mind is just gone
He’s begging me
And begging me
And ringing my phone

[Hook]
Juicy got ‘em crazy

[Verse 4]
Count it off

Bust it
Let’s discuss it
Yeah
Once again

Juice is the master
In the end
We always win

He was cold fronting
On the corner
Down the street (Right)

I rolled on by
And caught his eye
And now he’s down with me

Here we go
Life is like a dance
Like a party
Like a song
Like a king
Like a prince
Like my sucker
When’s home

(yeah)

Ladies don’t you worry
If your man gets outta line
Just ration out the juice
Till it gets pay time

(yeah)

[Hook]
Juicy got ‘em crazy

Juicy got ‘em crazy
Got ‘em crazy
Got ‘em cold goin’ mad
Cold goin’ mad

The man is gone
The boy has flipped
Gotta a little bit of juice
And now you know that’s it
That juice has got ‘em
That juice has got ‘em
That juice has got ‘em
That juice has got ‘em

He won’t let go
