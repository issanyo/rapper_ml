When you find a brand new love
Isn't it fun love
That special one to kiss and hug
Isn't it fun love

Bridge:
I want you
Every night
Heart cries out
To hold you tight

You walked in
Times were blue
Nothing baby
I won't do

Chorus:
For the love of you-ooh
For the love of you-ooh

There's a sweetness in your smile
Isn't it fun love
A wild flower you drive me wild
Isn't it fun love

Bridge:
Touch me baby
With your love
Stir the passion
You're thinking of

Stay with me
A while tonite
We will fly
Until morning light

Chorus

Bridge:
Don't you know how I feel
Here's my love I'm for real
Time is right give us a chance
Nothing-I won't do-for you

Rap:
To each his all and all the love I've grown
Three rolls of quarters in the telephone
One at a time and I'm glad she's mine
For the love of her and that's for a long time
I want her, I love her, I keep thinking of her
I want to be her friend
Because I'm definitely not her brother
I'll make it clear that I'll always be near
And for the love of you my love is here
Not so up on, one can always be taught
For the love of you many brothers have fought
So comprehend the feelings are true
A day don't go by without thinking of you
You're smooth as the night and I get hype
Your love and mine are the perfect type, yeah!

I write a letter or play you a song
We should get busy yeah get it on
Pumping out heat, burning like fire
Fall in love with you
Yeah that's my desire

Bridge

Chorus
