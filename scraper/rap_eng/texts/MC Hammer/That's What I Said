I can do it
Yeah mayne! Now I can do it
Aww this that rollin beat man
I can roll with this
I can roll with this just like ridin over that Bay Bridge
Golden Gate y'nderstandwhatImean?
Oh look at that skeezer over there man
I ain't with it

[Hammer]
Now now now the drum gets deeper and the beats get stronger
So take a deep breath before you're forced under
The line that divides what's yours from mine
In effect is what I am cause I served my time
Concrete solid beats topped off with rhymes
A fly posse put together by the Hammer's mind
Now the song is in effect and my soul is fed
And these are my words, that's what I said

[Chorus]
That's what he said
(Yo hype my posse man)
Go posse, go posse go; go posse, go posse go
Go posse, go posse go; go posse, go posse go

[Hammer]
M, MC's line up and they start to boast
Who's the best, who's the best, and they all get roasted
By the Hammer on the mic, by the Hammer on the floor
By the Hammer, MC Hammer, the keeper of the door
That leads to the chair where the king of rap sits
While MC's battle, in the rap pits
They go RHYME, for RHYME, and HOOK, for HOOK
Thugs turn rappers and rappers turn CROOKS
Now the song is in effect and my soul is fed
And these are my words, that's what I said

[Chorus]

{*instrumental breakdown*}
Dance!
Use the Hammer as a weapon so don't you worry about a thing
I don't worry about a thing, I'm goin straight up
You understand me? There they go
There go that big ol' greasy

[Chorus]

[Hammer]
Now now now, I go to the show, I pay my money
I realized, something's funny
Music's cold kickin and the crowd is hyped
But the MC on the stage, is stiff as a pipe
His hips do move but his feet don't budge
He moves across the stage like he's stuck on a rug
He needs the beat and the Hammer and the posse gettin busy
The show that we give, will make a sucker dizzy
Now the song is in effect and my soul is fed
And these are my words, that's what I said

[Chorus] - to fade
