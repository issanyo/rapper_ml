[Hook 9X]
Turn, this mother out

MC Hammer, he will...
Hammer, he is!

[Hammer]
Strong like a lion, no denyin'
I'm in effect and you suckers are tryin'
To get with me, you can't hang
Doin' it like this I'm in with the bang
Goin' boom like thunder, and you wonder
How in the world could the Hammer be under
'Neath me, he's gonna beat me
Say yes to the master and I will teach thee

[Hook 6X]
Turn, this mother out

Hammer! Tell 'em how you came up babyyyyy...

[Hammer]
I was a student, now I'm the teacher
I was a member, now I'm a preacher
I was a worker and you was a boss
Now I'm gettin' paid and you're takin' a loss
Once it's up, the others just leave
Don't bold perpetrate, MC Hammer is the feature
Step off, you pump no fear
I'm MC Hammer and I'm in here to

[Hook 6X]
Turn, this mother out

Let's get it started!
