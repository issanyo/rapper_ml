[Chorus]
That's word, we pray (Pray, pray)
We got to pray just to make it today
I said we pray (Pray)
Oh yeah we pray (Pray)
We got to pray just to make it today
That's word, we pray

[Verse 1]
All my life I wanted to make it to the top
(That's word, we pray)
Some said I wouldn't, they told me no, but I didn't stop
(That's word, we pray)
Working hard, making those moves everyday
(That's word, we pray)
And on my knees, every night you know I pray

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now I just think that you can do whatever you want
(That's word, we pray)
I'm busting these rhymes making this money and I won't
(That's word, we pray)
Forget my people or my town or my ways
(That's word, we pray)
And on my knees every night I'm still gone pray

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Time and time and time and time and time again
(That's word, we pray)
I kept on knocking, but these people wouldn't let me in
(That's word, we pray)
I tried and tried and tried and tried to make a way
(That's word, we pray)
But nothing happened 'til that day I prayed

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Children dying, oh so fast from this and that
(That's word, we pray)
Need that money, working that dope, smoking that crack
(That's word, we pray)
Ten years old, stand outside, better look out
(That's word, we pray)
Dead and gone, never had a chance, what's it all about?

[Alternate Chorus]
That's word, we pray (Pray, pray)
We need to pray just to make it today
I said we pray (Pray)
Oh yeah we pray (Pray)
We need to pray just to make it today
That's word, we pray

That's word, we pray (3x)

[Alternate Chorus]

[Verse 5]
On a mission start to doubt, here we go
(That's word, we pray)
Kicking back, read these words we need to know
(That's word, we pray)
Living high, living good, living long
(That's word, we pray)
Take a minute, bust a prayer and you good to go

[Alternate Chorus]

[Outro]
We're sending this one out to the Lord
And we thank you and we know we need to pray
Cause all the blessings that are good
They come from above
And once again we want to say "thank you" to the Lord
With all our love
We outta here
That's word, we pray

That's word, we pray (pray, pray) (4x)
