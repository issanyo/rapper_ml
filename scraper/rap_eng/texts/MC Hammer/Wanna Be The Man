Rap:
Yo! bust this!
I got a plan to take you by the hand
And whisper in your ear that
I wanna be your man
So understand the bottom line plan
I do do do do wanna be your man

You've been on a mission baby
To find the man in your life
You heart-it's been illin' baby
To find someone to treat you right

The question now is me
Will it hurt ya to believe
The love you see in my eyes
Tho distant you choose to be
My sincerity
Will bring you around in time

Chorus:
Wanna be wanna be wanna be wanna be
Wanna be I wanna be the man in your life!!!

Rap:
Right now I need your attention
And be the man when you talk
That you mention
Your old lover he don't need no extension
'cause he's out and I'm whatcha missin'

I've got a vision baby
I can see a change coming in sight
My heart! open to you baby
I feel our love coming to light

Alone you do all right
My love will take you high
Higher higher, higher higher
I'll be there by your side
On clouds we will ride
Through the raining storm

Rap:
I need a minute and I'll be in it
You've got the love and you know I wanna win it
Stop looking 'cause you've been found
And your love is cold sweeter
Than a chocolate mound
So give it to me and understand
That I'm the one who wanna be your man
I gotta plan to take you by the hand
'cause I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, be your man

Bust it!
Yo! let's dance yeah

Funky music and this is def
The kickin' sound of EWF
And they do it like nobody else
Hyped up like myself yeah!

Chorus

Rap:
Hold on baby, wait a minute
So give it to me and come my way
And be my lover for the rest of my days
Give it to me and come on through
'cause I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna be with you

Chorus
