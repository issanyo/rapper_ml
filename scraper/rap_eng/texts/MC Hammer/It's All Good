(Hey)
(It's all good)
(It's all good)
Y'all ready for this?
(Uh huh, it's all good)
(Hey)
(It's all good)
Y'all ready for this?
(Uh huh, it's all good)

Now this ain't the name calling game
See, I can refrain from using names to get fame
Since I'm known to create the kinds of beats that make your rump shake
Records are great, but now let's set the record straight

(They thought you was a sellout)
I'm sellin' out tours 'cause sellin' CDs, I'm the one MB
You wanna beat the G, I beat you like hizzos
In the backseat of my Caddy you'll be callin' me Hammer Daddy

I'll work you like a slave
Misbehavin' you were gonna
Pay tax on one of my brothers' souls
Hit the street, caught up in your deuce
And I refuse to forget that alright you talked tough
But face to face was a just a trick, bro

They put me in the mix, too legit to quit
I came wit' a long list of it
And in the future you'll find me on the billboard
Or on the floor of the sign receiving music awards
And it's all good

(Hey)
(It's all good)
Y'all ready for this?
(Uh huh, it's all good)
(Hey)
(It's all good)
Y'all ready for this?
(Uh huh)

It's all good
The talk you been talkin'
To talk that talk
You gotta walk that walk
Oh, the Hammer man's talkin'
So enter the dragon
And once you burned up
Those caught in dissin' my bandwagon

Suckers, read Billboard and weep
You're in a hot seat, when I start talkin' to ya
And when I see ya, the styles you wrote man
A mean left hook took ya out, and it came from Oakland

Check it, you punks don't know me
A true OG, yo, I was runnin' the whole scene
You started talking that mess but I'm callin' your bluff trick
I thought you knew and boy you still can't touch this

It's better than the average bro
I'm not the average Joe with the average flow
Yo, I can still do things that you wish you could
You're talkin' all that lip, but I don't even trip
'Cause it's all good

(Hey)
(It's all good)
Y'all ready for this?
(Uh huh, it's all good)
(Hey)
(It's all good)
Y'all ready for this?
(Uh huh, it's all good)

(It's all good)
Y'all ready for this?
(Uh huh, it's all good)
(It's all good)
Y'all ready for this?
(Uh huh)

I'm fed up, so now I gotta set 'em up
Knock 'em to the ground and never ever let 'em up
But like a trick he might kick I'll be prepared to red 'em up
However, if you wanna slang 'em, then we can get 'em up

Black sheep, you're weak, you're meek, you're tryin' to grow feet
Dres I make ya look head but first, I'mma get your teeth
Talkin' about my mama's where I draw the line Redman
Dancin' with the corners of yo dome I'mma blow your mind, so!

Since I'm not the run of the mill
I feel the need to say you wanna be, you gotta be real
'Cause if ya ever come my way like I used to say
Homeboy you better pray just to make it today

I know what it is
The ratta tat piece of corny rhymes you keep sayin' we don't find worth playin'
I don't feel like I'm a gangsta so you claim that I'm a sellout
When we meet up on the street, then we'll see who bail out
And it's all good

(Hey)
(It's all good)
Y'all ready for this?
