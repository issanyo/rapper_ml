[Angie B:]
Girls from all around
Came to get down
With the Hammer
Can you pump it
You have to pump it
For the hammer

[MC Hammer:]
Yes for you
MC hammer I'm back again
Ready to stir you up and take you to the floor
I'm busy

Hot like fire
The people's desire
MC Hammer's gonna make you retire
Stand on the side, don't sweat this
You wanna try me boy, don't bet this
You might lose your shirt, you dog, you house
And even yo girl might put you out
About the Hammer
She's on my tip
Don't trip, get a grip and don't won't slip
The other way
What more can I say
I'm MC Hammer and I got it that way

(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix
(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix

Did I hear say king?
Or call yourself ruler?
Sit down cause the Hammer's gonna school ya
A ruler is a stick I use to measure
Suffer in the game who have no treasure
You ain't it
You ain't dope
If you are the king then the Hammer is the Pope
The President of your own resident
Up against me boy and your hesitant
You get hype
Your feet don't budge
You against me we don't need no judge

(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix
(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix

Like the tortoise and the hare you didn't wanna race me
A weak toy rather than face me
I came up and you change
Just like that you don't know my name
So I'll teach you once again
Help a young boy become a man
I am daddy you are son
I'm comin' up and you are done
I sweat to move the crowd
You are then and I am now

(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix
(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix

Step aside boy
I'm alive boy
Think it's a toy boy
I destroy boy
It only one year
It didn't take two
And just like that fake rappers are thru
Gone, finished, done, caputs
In other words you got the hook
Yank yank pushed to the side
Your 87 and I'm 89
This is a style
And I made it
You couldn't do it if you cold went and paid for it

(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix
(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix

On my side
Down with me
She's so fly, sing Angie B

[Angie B:]
Can you pump it when you want to
Can you pump it when you need to
Can you pump it when you want to
Can you pump it when you need
Can you pump it
Can you pump it
Can you pump it
Can you pump it
With the Hammer
With the Hammer
With the Hammer

[MC Hammer:]
(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix
(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix

King of the hype
Busy at the gig
Get on the mic, homeboy, Too Big

[Too Big:]
Get busy, get hype
Hammer's taking a break while I'm on the mic
Too Big, in effect
Pumpin' up the house I got the Hammers back
Pumpin' louder, can you feel it
Too Big, MC, I'm so real with it
Blowin' up, it's showbiz
I'm Too Big and he is

[MC Hammer:]
(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix
(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix

Feet got the touch
I'm too much
MC Hammer I got it all wrapped up
Make no mistake, I know
The people get hype at a MC Hammer show
Everybody up, nobody down
I'm in control like a picture on the mound
I gotta hit
I won't quite
Givin' all the people all they can get
Upbeat, I see
Number 1 so close wait a minute it's me

(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix
(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix

The Hammer is down
Like the boy B Brown
My prerogative
MC's getting clowned

So there it is
And you know
The Hammers gone keep giving up the show
Sweat till I can't sweat no mo
And to all the perpetrators
You betta get busy

(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix
(Hammer, Hammer) I am (Hammer) They put me in the mix
