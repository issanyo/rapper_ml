This is what we do (do, do, do it)
This is what we do (do, do, do, do it)
This is what we do (do, do, do it)
This is what we do (do, do, do, do it)

My body
It's my body
Take it where I want to
A pump it up party
It's true from me to you

I make my own decisions
Do what I want to do
No time to sit and wait
We do what we do
And what we do can't wait

This is what we do
This is what we do
This is what we do
This is what we do

I tap and wax
Slam hard
Can't relay
The hype is in my eyes
And the posse's got my back

I intend to win
So let the fun begin
Chillin' at the top
And no suckers can get it
A chance is a chance
A chance to talk

I step
I move
I bend
I don't break

I dip
I dive
I duck
You stuck
We do what we do
And what we do it too much

Dance
That's what we do
Everybody in the posse
And everybody in the crew
We get up and then get hyped

You know what time it is
When Hammer's on the mic
So move to the hype of the night

The crowd's getting busy
And the feeling is right
What that body heat on you
Pump it us hard
And this is what we do


This is what we do
This is what we do
This is what we do
This is what we do

[Repeat x3:]
Get hyped
And do it
Wave your hands
And do it
Pump your body
And do it, do it, do it

Diss me
You try to diss me?
Makes no difference
'Cause the people are with me

I
I'm proved
You got schooled
I'm running things
And you want to rule
The 90s are mine
It's a Hammer review

You want to know how?
Just watch what I do
I do, I do, I do
You through
Busting your bubble
That's what we do
