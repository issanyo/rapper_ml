Hammer, you ain't hittin' in New York
What?
So what you gon' do about that, Hammer?
I'm gon' turn this mutha out

Hammer, he is...

Strong like a lion, no denyin'
I'm in effect and you suckas are tryin'
To get with me, you can't hang
Doin' it like this, I'm in with a bang
Goin' boom like thunda, and you wonder
How in the world can the Hammer be underneath me?
He's gonna beat me, say yes to the master and I will teach thee

Oaktown posse they will
Turn this mutha out

Turn this mutha out

Hammer, tell 'em how you came up babeeee!

I was a student, now I'm the teacher
I was a member, now I'm the preacher
I was a worker, and you were the boss
Now I'm gettin' paid and you're takin' the loss
Once says stop, the other says flee
No, don't perpetrate M.C. Hammer is the feature
Step off, you punk, no fear, I'm M.C. Hammer and I came here to...

Turn this mutha out
Oaktown posse they will
Turn this mutha out
Yeah boy, they will
Turn this mutha out
M.C. Hammer he will

I'm improvin', better start schoolin
Headed to the top where I'll be rulin'
On top, of hip-hop, I'm in effect and you're not
Your records aren't cool, your shows are weak
Duel with the Hammer and meet defeat
Every night, every week
I'm comin' correct, you don't want none of me

Turn this mutha out
Oaktown posse they will
Turn this mutha out
Yeah boy, they will
Turn this mutha out
M.C. Hammer he will

I keep hearin' what you sayin'
"Yo Hammer, we knowin' New York's on the wayin'"
I don't care where you from
I make most look silly, and others look dumb
Yeah suckas, you should, run
I am, def on the stage, pumpin' at the club
Hammer is an eagle, and you a dove

Turn this mutha out
Oaktown posse they will
Turn this mutha out
Yeah boy, they will
Turn this mutha out
M.C. Hammer he will

I'm from Oaktown, B-boy straight down
Takin all comers, whoever want to get some
I'm original, you're digital
You want somethin' to say, you're show is pitiful
Don't worry, I'm in tact
Whatever I say, the Hammer will back
Twice as strong, It's goin' on
And I willll...

Turn this mutha out
Oaktown posse they will
Turn this mutha out
Yeah boy, they will
Turn this mutha out
M.C. Hammer he will
