[Verse 1: Pastor Troy]
The last nigga, is the pastor, ready to blast ya
You know, I don't play no motherfuckin' games
D-S-G-B, you know the name
Wood grain in the motherfuckin' dually truck
Got the black and red seats, with the Georgia tuft
And I got my helmet, hangin' out the window
Ready to bust the head, of a fuckin' pretender
Nigga, as soon as I enter, you know I'm makin' noise
Pastor Troy, and the Eastside Boyz
A-K bustin', I ride the whole clip
I cock that ho, and let it motherfuckin' rip
To sank shit, is what I live for
Fuck him, Fuck her

Put some more 'yac in my mug
So I can throw it up

Throw it up, Motherfucker, throw it up

Though when I chill, fuckin' burn one
Leave up out the club, it's me and Little Jon
Ballin' in the Benz's, switchin' up lanes
Talkin' much shit cause we deep in the game; cocaine
