[Bridge:]
Tell me what I gotta do
To get things back to the way they was
I'm trying to fight it
But I find myself still thinking about us
Tell me what I gotta say to whatcha
Try to hear come out my mouth
I'm trying to work it out
Baby we need to we need to work this out

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what I'm trying to do?
I need to work it out between me and u
It ain't through I would do down to do anything
U ask just to get you back take you shopping
All over the map just to see you laugh pop 'em tags
U plus me do the math minus all the negative bs
U my other half ain't no other
That makes me feel the way
U do I can see myself coming back at you

I'm a whole different individual
Now everybody but you invisible
Now I wanna commitment
And I want you home you'd never miss a good thing
Till it's gone and I miss kissing u
And I'm miss spoiling miss you loving
And miss me adoring u

[Bridge:]
Now tell me what I gotta do
To get things back to the way they was
I'm trying to fight it
But I find myself still thinking about us
Tell me what I gotta say
To whatcha try to hear come out my mouth
I'm trying to work it out
Baby I'm trying to work it out tell me tell me
What I gotta do to get things back
To the way they was

Still thinking about us
Tell me what I gotta say
To whatcha try to hear come out my mouth

Baby we need to we need to work this out

[Verse 2]
A lot of ladies in the world wanna be mine
But I don't give no time niggas
No shine no matter how many women I see
Without you girl I'm incomplete
I'm telling the world I can't be discreet
I ain't the same without you and me girl
I'd miss the arguments you can't be real
Not fraudulent how it look it's hard
To get another shorty like mine one
That can keep me up when I'm down besides my riches
Or my Bentley You can have all the rest
That comes with me that's my heart, mind, soul u
Can be my company where
Ever I go I'mma function
When I let you go now I'm trying to let you know so

[Bridge:]
Now tell me tell me what I gotta do to get things back to the way they was
I'm trying to fight it but I find myself still thinking about us
Tell me what I gotta say to whatcha try
To hear come out my mouth
I'm trying to work it out
Baby I'm trying to work it out
Now tell me tell me what I gotta do to get things
Back to the way they was

Still thinking about us

Baby we need to we need to work this out

[Verse 3]
Tell me when I'm gonna see 'em pretty
Pearly whites you can get it girl tonight
If you can act just right
Tell me that I'm your nigga for life and I'll tell you everything I know you like nobody else

That'll make you say wow ain't nothing about me
I ain't no child, grown man now let's figure
This out you stay on my mind
I can't take the lost like t-waters
I'm throwing off even when I try to perform
I think about you under my arm
I can't stand the rain but you can't under the storm
I be here for the long run
Even when the songs done you gonna
See that I'm the one here's what you need to come

[Bridge:]

Tell me what I gotta say to whatcha try
To hear come out my mouth

To hear come out my mouth
