[Intro: Nelly + (Jermaine Dupri)]
Sing it for me
Everybody come on
(Y'all know what this is)
Let's go

[Janet]
I don't know if I've ever felt like this before
But I'm sure that the way I feel, I don't want it to go
'Cause I've cried my share of tears
And I've sang my share of blues
But to keep you right here, I'll do what I got to do

[Chorus: Janet Jackson + Nelly + both]
So baby, call on me
Whether day or night, I'll never leave
See, you don't have to be alone
I'll come anywhere you want
Baby, just pick up the phone and call on me
So you ain't know
I wanna be your homie, lover, friend
See there it go, see there it go

[Verse 2: Nelly]
See, I never met a girl that could break me down
It's like I get caught in the middle
I get caught up a little anytime that she's around
I be posted, waitin' on standby
Lookin' to catch the red eye
I'm doin' whatever, whenever
Never forgot I said I'd be
Here when you want to get what you need
If you wanna receive the, oh, please believe you could

[Chorus: Janet Jackson + Nelly + both]
Call on me
Whether day or night, I'll never leave
See, you don't have to be alone
I'll come anywhere you want
Baby, just pick up the phone and call on me
So you ain't know
I wanna be your homie, lover, friend
See, there it go, see, there it go

[Bridge: Janet]
Call on me
When you need someone who cares
Say the words and I'll be there
I can meet you anywhere
Call on me
Anytime that you please
Babe, whatever you want
Be whatever you need
Because you're the one I love baby, just

[Chorus: Janet Jackson + Nelly + both]
Call on me
Whether day or night, I'll never leave
See, you don't have to be alone
I'll come anywhere you want
Baby, just pick up the phone and call on me
So you ain't know
I wanna be your homie, lover, friend
See, there it go, see, there it go, mama

[Nelly]
It don't matter where you go
I'll come anywhere you want me to

[Janet]
It don't matter near or far
It's like anything you say I'll do

[Both]
And it don't matter where you go
I'll come anywhere you want me to
And it don't matter near or far
It's like anything you say I'll do

[JD]
Everybody come on
