[Intro]
This one's for the lovers
Follow me

[Verse 1]
Clearly, this is new for me
I get excited when you're here, my dear
Make no mistake, you are all I see, sugar
My visions never been so clear
We both know that I've been running so long
This time, love won't let me leave
Please be patient, hesitation aside
We're almost where we need to be
But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind

[Chorus]
Baby, I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know

[Bridge 1]
Think back to the time
When I was scared to let it show
Having too much fun, this and that or what
Now that you're mine
Somewhere along the way everything fell in place

[Verse 2]
I'm so proud of how you represent me, baby
Whether rocking Armani, Dolce Gabbana
Roberto Cavalli, Louis, or Gucci, girl
No matter what you wear, you do your own with it
I'll feel the same years from here
But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind

[Chorus]
Baby, I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know
That I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know

[Bridge 2]
You know I need you baby, you know I do
I need you baby, you know I do
I need you baby, you know I do
Know I need you baby
Now that you're mine
Somewhere along the way, everything fell in place

[Chorus]
Baby, I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know
I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, girl, I need your soul
I'll never, never let you go

[Outro]
You're so special
