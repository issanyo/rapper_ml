[Verse 1]
Saw the cover, the finest girl that you've ever seen
Just had to buy me, had to try me
Ooh, you're in love with the hottest girl in the magazine
You do whatever to have me all to yourself
I know you can't stop lookin' so don't try to deny it
Baby, I can see in your eyes
You'd do anything if I let you inside of me
What would you do if I came to life? Let me tell ya

[Chorus]
This body of mine, this body of mine
Boy, I'm trying to warn you about
This body of mine, this body of mine
And you'll go crazy when you see me, see me
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around

[Verse 2]
Now we're at your home, lead the way to your room
What you're lookin' for is right on page 52
You see what you like, reading about what I like
When I'm all alone in the zone with a man
Now would you be ready if I stepped off these pages
And told you that that man was you?
Or would you turn out to have some great conversation
But didn't know what to do, once you got a look at

[Chorus]
This body of mine, this body of mine
Boy, I'm trying to warn you about
This body of mine, this body of mine
And you'll go crazy when you see me, see me
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
(This body)

[Verse 3: JD]
Now I was walking through the airport, stopped at the gift shop
Saw this girl on the cover of Maxim, made a (nigga) jaw drop
Man, she was F-I-N-E, head to toe
Six-page spread, baddest thang I ever seen befo'
Stuck in the store dreaming, can't even get to the register
Girl behind the counter talking but I'm like the hell with her
'Cause I swear I deserve this girl talking through the pages
Telling me what she like and how she like it in different places
What she eat to keep her body tight, definition of Mr. Right
I fit that description to the T, to the T
All the (shit) that she don't like, live for a late night
It sounds like she's talking right to me, especially when she said

[Bridge]
I know you can't stop lookin' so don't try to deny me
Baby, I can see in your eyes
You'd do anything if I let you inside me
What would you do if I came to life? Let me tell ya

[Chorus]
This body of mine, this body of mine
Boy, I'm trying to warn you about
This body of mine, this body of mine
And you'll go crazy when you see me, see me
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
