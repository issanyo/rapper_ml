[Spoken Intro]
Breathe

[Chorus: Janet Jackson (Khia)]
You get me so, get me so excited
I'm hot, come on, so get it ready
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
(Act bad, don't hurt me
Look sexy, talk dirty)
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
(Get me so excited)

[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
For some reason
It might be the money that really turns you on
But for me it's an attitude that keeps me tight on the floor
And no words are suitable to describe your swagger, baby
And my body is in overdrive when I have you inside of me

[Pre-Chorus: Janet Jackson]
How you like it when I do it?
I go head to toe
And whenever you pursue it
You'll never hear the word no
So forget about them other girls, baby
'Cause now you're rollin' with a woman, baby
I'ma keep your body thumpin', baby
It's the least I can do
'Cause you get me so excited

[Chorus: Janet Jackson (Khia)]
I'm hot, come on, so get it ready
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
(Act bad, don't hurt me
Look sexy, talk dirty)
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
(Get me so excited)

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
So amused by mind control that I wanna get two step ups
As for me I'ma let you know that my body's smoking hot
Throw me up against whatever's close
And get to bossin' me around
And everytime I give you the assist
You know how to slam it down

[Pre-Chorus: Janet Jackson]
Have you like it when I do it?
I go head to toe
And whenever you pursue it
You'll never hear the word no
So forget about them other girls, baby
'Cause now you're rollin' with a woman, baby
I'ma keep your body thumpin', baby
It's the least I can do
'Cause you get me so excited

[Chorus: Janet Jackson (Khia)]
I'm hot, come on, so get it ready
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
(Act bad, don't hurt me
Look sexy, talk dirty)
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
(Get me so excited)

[Rap Break: Khia]
Is ya, is ya, is ya hungry?
I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha licking on my, licking on my
Licking on my body body like it's something to eat
So you can act bad, don't hurt me
Look sexy, get me so excited)

[Chorus: Janet Jackson (Khia)]
I'm hot, come on, so get it ready
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
(Act bad, don't hurt me
Look sexy, talk dirty)
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
(Get me so excited)
