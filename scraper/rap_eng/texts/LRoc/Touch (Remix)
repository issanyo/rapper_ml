[T.I.] Yeah
Amerie-Most people say
[T.I.] What they say shorty
Amerie-They think
[T.I.] What's that that you all sweet and innocent
Amerie-Huh, well
[T.I.] Well you is ain't you
Amerie-Why don't you get to know me
[T.I.] All right A!

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid to touch
I know you think I'm a good girl
Don't you think a girl like me can be (touched)
Don't be afraid to touch
I know you think I'm a good girl
Don't you think a girl like me should be (touched)

[Verse 1]
He's lookin' like he can't believe this
Always in my jeans and
And bet he don't know what I'm thinkin' (I wanna take him home with me)
This here's gonna be my weekend
I don't think he knows that I see him
His body gots me weak (and I can't wait to see)

[Hook]
What I really want is for him to do to me what he wants to (oh)
He would want to, yeah (oh)
He can come inside my mind
If he tried but he don't know how I want to (oh)
Baby, don't you know what you get from me

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid to touch
I know you think I'm a good girl
Don't you think a girl like me can be (touched)
Don't be afraid to touch
(TI - Alright)
I know you think I'm a good girl
Don't you think a girl like me should be (touched)

[Verse 2]
I know I ain't been drinkin'
Damn, he's got me leanin'
All up in my ear breathin'
We over here makin' a scene and I don't really care who sees
I just want him to feel (my love inside of me)

[Hook]
What I really want is for him to do to me what he wants to (oh)
He would want to, yeah (oh)
He can come inside my mind
If he tried but he don't know how I want to (oh)
(T.I.- Sho Nuff')
Baby, don't you know what you get from me

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid to touch
I know you think I'm a good girl
Don't you think a girl like me can be (touched)
Don't be afraid to touch
I know you think I'm a good girl
Don't you think a girl like me should be (touched)

[T.I.]
Hey!
Let me get cha where I want cha in your best night gown
Yeah I had a lot of women you the best I found
If I offer you the chance you neglect like how
When my hand like damn and my neck like wow
Lebanese Porto Rican light brown said they heard I'm the king wanna test my crown
Swerve on them thangs in the vet top down
I'm the realest with a dealest that rep my town
So if you ever wanna get off your chest I'm down
How fly does a g-fly jet ride sound
Triple black phantom sit your S5 down now your girl wanna talk about sex right now
Why I hate them other rappers but respect my style
How I kiss her on her legs while her dress slide down
Amerie I wanna see ya wit cha hair let down
And ya body soaking wet on a bed stretched out

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid to touch
I know you think I'm a good girl
Don't you think a girl like me can be (touched)
Don't be afraid to touch
I know you think I'm a good girl
Don't you think a girl like me should be (touched)
Touch, Touch

[T.I. talking]
Yeah I know you want to be
What's up I know that you don't know me or nothing
Why don't we go and have a nice time together
