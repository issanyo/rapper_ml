[Verse 1: Too $hort]
You couldn't be a better playa than me
Even if you fucked every day of the week
I know you think you got it like that but peep
I be fuckin' hoes every day of the week
You never could be a better playa than me
Even if you rolled in luxury
I know you sport-coatin' that top notch freak
You never could be a better playa than me
When I first got to the club it was cool to fuck
Walked passed these hoes and they looked me up and back down again
Recognize a pimp
Next thing I know, I'm tellin' lies again
Sellin' dreams to hoes from everything I know
Grab the microphone then I spit these flows
I came in this muthafucka with my niggas
I plan on leavin' here with yo bitches
Anybody feel they got a problem with that
You need to take off yo pimp hat nigga
And get the fuck out my way
'Cause I don't fuck with scrubs on any day
I can't buy her no drink, she can't ride with me
I don't know her and she can't stand beside me
But yo bitch, I might fuck her
Just because I know you's a sucker

[Chorus: Too $hort]
Let my nuts go, bitch
Let my nuts go
Let my nuts go, bitch
Do you like the way they swang
Let my nuts go, bitch
Let my nuts go
Let my nuts go, bitch you keep rappin' in my ear and got me mad as hell

[Verse 2: The Nation Riders]
Let me hit that weed, [?] what you drinkin'
6 months ago, hoe yo ass wasn't speakin'
Now I see yo face in every bad way stop
Tryin' yo plots since the CD dropped
I went nuts cause I'm like that with Too $heezy
Got no time for you triflin' ass broke breezies
Jon [?] doin' thangs, now that's so true
And you bad news bitch I ain't fuckin' with you
Punk bitch think she real smart, runnin' that G
But talk is cheap hoe, spend some cash money with me
Look up when I pull up and come runnin' to see
If $hort Dog is in the car, Murder 1 is with me
You heard Nationwide was ballin', we make 100's and G's
Takin' trips to the islands, smilin' under the trees
When I step up, all these heffers start comin' for me
Let my nuts go chickenhead you gets nothin' for free

[Chorus: Too $hort]
Let my nuts go, bitch
Let my nuts go
Let my nuts go, bitch
Do you like the way they swang
Let my nuts go, bitch
Let my nuts go
Let my muthafuckin' nuts go
Bitch, you keep rappin' in my ear and got me mad as hell

[Verse 3: The Nation Riders]
Now we gettin' hella looks soon as we pimped through the door
And we seen hell of freaks we ain't fucked before
They got some bitches on the prawl of gold-diggin' missions
And my folks is livin' foul, they whoopin' ass with precision
Fallin' back at the club, smoked up
Gettin' scoped by a hoe with a nigga, I know she tryin' to fuck
But her homie wanna play G.I. Joe
Hommie you better check yo hoe before yo big ass hit the flo'
Let my nuts go
Nigga when I step in the club
'Cause y'all blowin' stress and we blowin' bud
I showed him love once and let him come with my crew
Now every fuckin' time he tryin' to jump in line
Yellin' out, "[?] can I get in with y'all?"
I ain't feelin' sorry for him, so I tell him, "Hell naw"
Now $hort Records in the VIP
I'ma sock you if you don't get off my N-U-T's

[Chorus: Too $hort]
Let my nuts go, bitch
Let my nuts go
Let my nuts go, bitch
Do you like the way they swang
Let my nuts go, bitch
Let my nuts go
You better let my nuts go
Bitch, you keep rappin' in my ear and got me mad as hell

[Bridge: Lil' Jon & Eastside Boys]
What the fuck my nigga what the fuck (What the fuck)
What the fuck my nigga what the fuck (What the fuck)
What the fuck my nigga what the fuck (What the fuck)
What the fuck my nigga what the fuck (What the fuck)
Back up bitch nigga back (Back up)

Now if you want some (What), come and get some (Get some)
If you want some nigga come get some (Come get some)
Now if you want some (What), come and get some (Get some)
If you want some nigga come get some (Come get some)
Why you all on my nuts like a trick
I heard you was a jailhouse bitch
Why you all on my nuts like a trick
I heard you was a jailhouse bitch
Nigga

[Chorus: Too $hort]
Let my nuts go, bitch
Let my nuts go
Let my nuts go, bitch
Do you like the way they swang
Let my nuts go, bitch
Let my nuts go
Let my muthafuckin' nuts go
Bitch, you keep rappin' in my ear and got me mad as hell

[Verse 4: Quint Black]
Uh, the word is Dollar ain't the same
Ever since I started Nation ridin', got a lil' change
Surrounded myself by game, niggas sayin' I'm counterfeit
Ain't that a bitch
Re-evaluate and stop ridin' my dick
Leave that to yo main bitch, let her live once
Niggas always surround when I burn my blunts
Give me 3 feet and let me eat
Niggas some bitches, used to be too good now they can't speak
