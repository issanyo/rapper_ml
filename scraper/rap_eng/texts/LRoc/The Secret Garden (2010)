Let me talk to you

[LL Cool J]
I told you gently, please get out your clothes
Let your body sing, visualize now
Let my tongue lead the way
Take me now, slow baby, it's a wet dream
All night long, we touch, relax, no need to rush, fall back
Your boy got a green thumb, girl a song
Slippin' on them rose pedals all night long
The one thing i promise if you put me on
Is absolute passion and beyond
Promise i'll go slow, look in your eyes, hold your body tight
Some may say it's wrong, cause i snuck in the secret
Garden to take a bite
And it tasted good too
