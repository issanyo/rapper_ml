[Verse 1]
Boy, ain't no secret about you and me
(About you and me, about you and me)
I know you can see it, it's all over me
(It's all over me, it's all over me, all over me)
Ain't it true?
I got your heart (I got your heart) and you own mine
Ain't it true?
Me and you - we just get better with time

[Chorus]
Can't take my eyes off you
Can't take my lips off you, baby
Can't keep my hands off you
Ooh, baby, you are...
You're so sexy
You're so sexy, oh, yeah
You're so sexy
You're so sexy, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm under your spell, boy
Your magical powers (powers, powers)
I'm drinking your potion
And it last for hours (it last for hours)
Ain't it true? (Ain't it true?)
You did this on purpose
You said I deserved it
And ain't it true?
It rubbed off on you
And now you can't turn me loose

[Chorus]
Can't take my eyes off you, ooh
Oh, baby, can't take my lips off you, no, no, no
Can't keep my hands off you, baby
'Cause you're...
You're so sexy
You're so sexy, baby
You're so sexy
Boy, you're so sexy, oh

[Bridge]
I just can't stop touching you
Can't keep my eyes off you
Can't keep my lips off you
Can't take my hands off you
Please
Can't keep my eyes off you
Can't keep my lips off you
Can't take my hands off you
I can't, I can't (can't keep my eyes off you)
I just can't (can't keep my lips off you)
I just can't (can't take my hands off you)
Keep my hands off you, baby

[Chorus]
Can't take my eyes off you
Can't keep my lips off you
Where you from, you sexy thing?
Can't take my hands off you
Can't keep my hands off you, baby
'Cause you are...
You're so sexy (yes, you are)
You're so sexy
You're so sexy
You're so sexy, oh
