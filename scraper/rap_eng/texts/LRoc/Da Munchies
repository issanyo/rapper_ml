[Verse 1: Batman]
C'mon, baby
You know me, I need a juicy fruity
I could really sink my teeth into
You're so sweet (yeah)
I get diabetes and my greetings
I just wanna be alone with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're the flavor of my month
I think about you all the time
A girl like you needs someone like me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got the munchies for you, baby
You got the flavor I adore (I adore)
I got the munchies for you, baby
C'mon, let me munch you up
Let me munch you up, oh

[Verse 2: Batman, Romeo & Half Pint]
Oh, my love
Guess who's thinking of over-under
Up the stairs and into your wildest dreams
Batman (guess again)
Munchie Man (yo, let me in)
I just wanna eat you up

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're the flavor of my month
I think about you all the time
A girl like you needs someone like me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got the munchies for you, baby
You got the flavor I adore (I adore)
I got the munchies for you, baby
C'mon, let me munch you up
Let me munch you up, oh

[Bridge 1]
I got the munchies, I got the munchies
I got the munchies, I got the munchies
I got the munchies, I got the munchies
I got the munchies, I got the munchies
Munchies
Munchies

[Verse 3: Romeo, Batman, Half Pint & Immature]
Romeo's giving yourself up to your feed-belt
Dreading all your wishes with the Hershey's kisses
And this is...
A way of dribble to the munch, though
Behold, the next Immature episode
Let me munch, let me crunch, yo, check it
Romeo to keep check 'em, coming back for seconds
Even little man gets the munchies every now and then
As my friends, yo, fellas, am I in?
Yeah

[Bridge 2]
I got the munchies, I got the munchies (I wanna eat you up)
I got the munchies, I got the, I got the...

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Chocolate chip, Cool Whip
Almond Joy, Vanilla Crunch
All those other girls, get on my face
You're my Lifesaver
You're my favorite flavor, baby
You're the only one I wanna munchie
Only one I want

[Chorus]
I got the munchies for you, baby
You got the flavor I adore (I adore)
I got the munchies for you, baby
C'mon, let me munch you up
Let me munch you up, oh

[Bridge 1 (until fade)]
I got the munchies, I got the munchies
I got the munchies, I got the munchies
I got the munchies, I got the munchies
I got the munchies, I got the munchies
