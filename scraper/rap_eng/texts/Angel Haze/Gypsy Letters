[ Angel Haze ]
Found you in the summer time
Your heart play drums up under mine
And I'm hunted by your silhouette
And can taste your skin on my fingertips
I found you, I had you, let you walk away
Now I chase you and taze you like everyday
It was Coachella middle of the spring time
Frank Ocean, Iceberg,Green line
Now my mind is onto you vivid
Flashback guess top home to your image
You would fuck me 'til I'm numb
'Til my bones roots feeling
'Til my body levitated 'til it rose to the ceiling
'Til my lungs were constricted and I tought that I would die
Said I was your fallen angel when you got me from the sky,right

(Chorus)
Love comes at really awkward times
I've learned that doesn't always rhyme
My ink grows when tryin' writing letter to you
My heart is in half cause it's better in two
Keep writing, keep ,keep writing
Know I'll never reach you but I keep ,keep trying
Keep writing, keep ,keep writing
Know I'll never reach you but I keep ,keep trying
Keep writing, keep ,keep writing
Know I'll never reach you but I keep ,keep trying
Damn I just wish I could forget you
Writing gypsy letters cause I know I'll never catch you

(Verse)
Drowned in it, momentary lounge in it
Took for me like a field and the plow with it
Dry fate that was hoping for the best
And if I ain't getting that I was hoping for the rest
I opened up my heart like a sail open parachute
You made me feel real I don't think it's fair to you
Damn ,told you anything that hurt me
And you did it all like you never even hurt me
But I'm a slave to the crave for your touch now
Got me waiting on for whenever you touchdown
Stand up like a plane after take off
Vendetta, Nicolas Cage with a faceoff
Dig you,wherever you are now
This the only way I know to pull my heart out
I mean it when I told you it was real
And ever since then you're the only one I feel like

(Chorus)
(Verse)
Laying next to a maze that I'm trapped in
No way I no means for an exit
Burnin' man, Pheonix Arizona
Got laid there like a momentary coma
Whispered in my ears from the souls what they see
Don't chase love you just go where it leads you
Yeah ,had to feel you in my palms
You are my drug like I feel you in my arm
And my heart is where I hold it
I could be your soul sis you could be my soulstice
And we could meet wherever this stops
Two souls together tied in, in a fish knot
I just hope I don't drown in your memories
Let me weigh the water promise you'll remember me
Since patience is a virtue ,breathe gets heavy
And the weight could really hurt you
But I believe in this , just leave a piece of you
If you leave again ,like

(Chorus)
