[Intro]
You know my mama use to always say that struggle is worth it
Because within struggle is purpose
And purpose is where your worth is
And a lot of people don't wanna live to see that
To me, they should

[Verse 1]
It's hard to dream with your eyes wide open
But if you keep 'em closed you can't really see where you're going
And maybe I'm just a dreamer and the world ain't really my home
And on the outside of my mind is the only place I belong
And I'm trapped inside a soul that's just way too broke to be strong
And that's trapped inside a life that's just way too long to be gone
And I give shit I give yeah it takes too much to be whole
The irony in that shit man sometimes is great to be wrong
And I smile but shit gets harder cause my heart is growing
Further apart from the other vessels that make me more of my soul
That make me less of a help to everything that surrounds me
It's tough to know I'm lost but it's harder to think I found me
Lining all the remnants the pain all his descendents
My fear has never been falling I'm deathly scared of ascendance
Damn, but I guess that's gotta mean something
I'm out of this world then I'm just hoping that I leave something

[Hook]
Smile n hearts, there are things that tear us all apart
But I still smile with my heart
Even though that shit bound to be torn apart
And I, I still (dream)
I still (dream), I-I still (dream), I still (dream)
(I believe in you, no matter what we've been through, I believe)

[Verse 2]
I met a kid out in Vegas desperately wanna make it
He said he runnin' from pain and just wants to know what will shake it
His girlfriend just had a baby, he out and he ain't around
Ain't got the skills to raise no kid, I never got to be a child
Never got to figure out what I wanted for mine, my dad bounced like a faggot
My mom was gone all the time, my stomach touching my spine
I had to go fucking grind, I took everything I wanted
The world was never fucking mine
These lies, they keep on feeding me lies
The son of a generation they keep denying me shine
They sayin' the world is mine but won't allow me to rise
So I got hell all in my heart and hatred all in my eyes
I'm froze, from my head to my soul
And I give shit I give but it takes too much to be whole, yeah
Ah, I just want someone to believe in me, tell me they know I'm hurt
But the goodness is all they see in me and

[Hook]
Smile n hearts, there are things that tear us all apart
But I still smile with my heart
Even though that shit bound to be torn apart
And I, I still (dream)
I still (dream), I-I still (dream), I still (dream)
(I believe in you, no matter what we've been through, I believe)

[Verse 3]
Beaten to a pulp, from the bottom she made it
You can see I'm on the scan no discards have honestly fading
She look up into the mirror and what she seeing she hating
So much evil in this world and it's beauty just masquerades it
They hide behind all their secrets, hide behind all their pain
I've been through so fucking much shit it's about to drive me insane
Sometimes I wish all the beating would knock it all out of my brain
Someone would just take the picture and crop me out of the frame
Yeah, and that's what's stolen my worth
Don't judge me about my appearance my soul is lower than dirt
My heart's been broken so many times I don't know if it works
And all I have is this smile and {that's the loneliest hurt}
And I'm froze stuck up in this place I only feel alone
And I give shit I give, but it takes too much to be whole
I want someone to fucking love me
I'm tired to coming last to everything that's above me

[Interlude]
And I smile, maybe it's a parody of all the tragedy inside us
We keep secrets like abortions
Life stolen then frozen within our psyche's lies on ice
Dancing with the demons, lips that rarely speak the truth
Acclimated by what we've been through, the mind is a terrible thing to waste
And at the same time it's a terrible place to wait
I'm wasting away, starting to expire, I see fire when your teeth show
Pride often of ego, thrown off like parts between syllables
Hiccups that can't be scared away, dreams not easy to decipher, conquer
But I still smile too but and inside I'm beating my knuckles to a bloody pulp
And even still I always wonder what it would feel like to be beautiful
To feel like rain on rose petals, to feel like sunshine
And have a life without suffering constantly
I find myself awaken through it all and inevitably risen
Rippen like fruit branches on the tree of knowledge
And again I wonder why the good have to suffer
What it means to be gentle, what we mean to one another
What it means to be a lover

[Outro]
Smile n hearts, there are things that tear us all apart
But I still smile with my heart
Even though that shit bound to be torn apart
And I, I still dream
You still dream, We still dream
Everyday, cause I believe in you
