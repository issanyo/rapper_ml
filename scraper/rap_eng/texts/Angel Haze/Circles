Don't get too attached to me

[Verse 1]
I get what I want then I decide that I ain't satisfied
Flippin' becomes something else like 6 into the number 9
Promise what I never mean and take you to that other side
Then step out your life, now your world seem like you colour blind
Can't break the cycle, it's a system and I know it well
Get introduced to heaven, and then I give'em hell
I got that potion, I put them under a vicious spell
And then I drop 'em like pennies into a wishing well
Told you I was different, chances are I lied
Said I'd give my all, and never really tried
But this heart is all I have and I cannot let it divide
And if we talking 'bout our feelings
I'm not acknowledging mine
We can build a little, break a little
Give a little, take a little
Talk about love, baby we could probably make a little
Or, we can feel it 'til it dies
But hold onto your heart cause I'm gon' hold onto mine

[Hook]x2
I've been running 'round in the same old circle
Cause when your running and you fall it could hurt you
But I can't give you what your dreaming of
Cause I run from everything I care about

[Verse 2]
I've been played before and it's a process
To get through everything
Then turn around and just acknowledge
The fact that people change
And everyone has different mind sets
And we can go through pain
But we shouldn't let it bind us
And we could hide from love
But chances are it finds us
And we can run for years
And its still in trail behind us, define us
There's a difference when you gifted and thrown into a position
And you hurt but your indifference can never stop you from feeling
And, I remember thinking you could save me
'Til you said that I'm the only one that can change me, crazy
Find a different filter to deal witch'ya opposition
Cause until it really kills
It should never stop you from living

[Hook]x2
