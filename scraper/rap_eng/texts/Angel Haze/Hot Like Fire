[Verse 1]
I don’t write love songs
But I'll write a maze for you
I got a lot to say, when shit pertains to you
A different settin', stepped out of hell into heaven
And your mind is a tool
But your body’s a lethal weapon
I see you and break a sweat
Then get near you and chase my breath
And I hate it when you gone
Cause I feel like there’s nothing left
Yeah, cause I want this shit forever
Eyes stained with your image, cause I picture us together
Nothing particular, I picture us wherever
On the couch, in the kitchen, shit, I picture us on shuffle
It’s a whole lot that I don’t know about you
But I’m willing and the lyrics in this song about you

[Hook]
(Hot like fire)
Got something that you can’t resist and
(I'm gonna take
You, take you higher)
One shot, like it's hit or miss and
(You can't
Resist)
Kissin', kissin'
(Kiss, kiss)
And kissin', kissin'

[Verse 2]
In your eyes where I hope to
Find my forever, see I hope to be the wait
That decides our forever
I hope to be the chains that bind us together
And you always change, remindin' the weather
Pay no mind to the motherfucking lies that they tell us
Got our head in the clouds like windin' propellers
And we’re never coming down nah, never coming down
Got you on that Collie Buddz, you forever coming 'round
Yeah you put it down, hell yeah you put it down
Like the music high as hell like drowning out the sound
Of the voices from behind, all the voices in your mind
And you’ll never come between us, cause I’m voicing at a time like

[Hook]
(Hot like fire)
Got something that you can’t resist and
(I'm gonna take you, take you higher)
One shot, like it's hit or miss and
(You can't resist)
Kiss kissin' kiss, kissin'
(Kiss, kiss)
And kissin', kissin'

[Verse 3]
I don’t wanna get caught up in the feeling of it all
I wanna go until I hit the ceiling of it all
Shit, kiss me like I’m different
Like the part of you that's missing reappeared when I popped up
Flier than a flock up
Sometimes I exhale, like my pain can escape me
And think 'til my thoughts got nowhere to take me
And you always make me question whether this'll ever work
Or if it’s just a game of who could hurt the other first

[Hook]
(Hot like fire)
Got something that you can’t resist and
(Take you higher)
One shot, like it's hit or miss and
(You can't resist)
Kissin', kissin'
(Kiss, kiss)
And kissin', kissin'

(Hot like fire)
Check me out, check me out, check me out like
(Take you higher)
One shot, like it's hit or miss and
(You can't resist)
(Kiss, kiss)
And kissin', kissin'
