[Verse 1]
Stepped up in the game
And dropped this motherfucker on its head
Promise everybody in this motherfucker gon be dead
Killin' shit, killin' it, jus'on my supervillian shit
Fuck a label and the blog. I'ma get familiar with
My brain is a Sicilian bitch, my tongue is like a million kicks
Murdered them on everything, droppin' like a heavy crane
Hard flow, bars dope, up here next to God flow
Wish a bitch would and I would box her like some cardboard
Swag fucking stupid I be on my Bart and Homer shit
Beat em, kill em, eat em, put em on that organ donor list
Im lyrically guillotine, revive it just to kill a beat
I'm like fucking Bubble Boy, you niggas can't get near to me
You bitches put no fear in me, I'm who you pretend to be
Say I don't stunt shit. You gotta be kidding me
Everybody talk then but ain't bout nothing in this industry
Come and take a look, I'm the realest and you finna see

[Hook] x2
Gimme one sound, gi-gimme one crown
I'm the, I'm the queen bitch gimme my pounds
Everybody lemme see your hands right now
Put em' up put em'up
Pull the sky down

[Verse 2]
Drop those bombs uh, drop that beat like
Ride it like Lance Armstrong on a speed bike
Spitting it like teeth, knocked out in a street fight
Shes like yeah bitch I'm on like street lights
Never get misconstrued, I been the shit since shit been poo
Bitch get outta my way or become my food
Get outta my face or meet my shoes
Get out of place and meet my crew
It's so insane, we act so ratchet
Soul food kitchen in this bitch I'm about my greens, parsley and cabbage

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
Spittin' like a heavy weight, a lot for them to handle
Drop it on the motherfuckers harder than an anvil
Who you think you kidding bitch I'm hotter than a handful
Of all these motherfuckers, when they flaming like candles
Everything I do, I do to prove that I am better than you
Bitch you think you cold, well I'm lyrically a sweater to you
Catch me in the world brah, doing what I said I'd do
All hail the Queen, bitches put me on a pedestal
And I'm out here running, I'm gunnin', I never stop to breathe
Angel "might" be good, bitch fuck your whole hypothesis
Bitch I came to kill shit, literally KILL shit
I came and bitches left, right? Got em' on that drill shit

[Hook] x3
