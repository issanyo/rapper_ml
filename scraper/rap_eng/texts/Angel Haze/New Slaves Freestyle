[Verse 1]
My mother was raised in the era when
Crack rock lived in the veins of our heroines
All this time you would've thought she had a mother
That wasn't selling her daughters for less than her younger brothers
See, it's cursed generation, I got these frames all in my mind
And it's broke generation, I got all this weight on my spine
Now we blinded by materials that they be shining in our face
A desensitized nation and we grow wilder everyday
Half your brain cells are dorment because they tell you you can't use them
We depending on computers cause they trying to make us stupid
New slaves
New slaves
New slaves

[Hook]
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2]
So fuck these idiotic theories, that's just stupid people city
There's too much ugly in the world to just be blinded by its pretty
That's why there's women being raped, judges diminishing the case
Got stupid actors making statements like they ain't cameras in their face
Cost way too much to go to college, niggas still end up jobless
And all these cops all corrupt, it's self-defense why he shot him
And I ain't blind to this shit, I see the fester and the hate
I know these times ain't changed, that's just deception in the date
And they don't want you to see, no, they don't want you to see
We getting way too deep, we floating up shit's creek
They put the truth where you won't look, truth where you won't look
Let's put this shit up on this page, you know them niggas don't read no books
No, them niggas don't read no books, no, them niggas don't read no books
Navigate through all the bullshit to see what else they took
New slaves
