Worst
Worst
Fucker he never loved us
Motherfucker never loved us
Ye ain’t know then you know now
From the bottom of my heart I give no fucks
Ah shit, nah
Just a motherfuckin anthem
And I ain’t gotta say shit, you ain’t gotta ask
Nigga that should be standard
Yea, I'm strictly 'bout the paper ho
You know how money make a ho
I used to floss hard and ain’t had shit
Yes, you gotta fake it til you make it
So I stayed with a Jamaican and I As-salamu alaykum
And a bunch of fucking models, only party on occasion
And I live up in that penthouse but I never left the basement
Once you understand trajectory, you know to cover bases

Yo, got em covering they faces
These bitches can’t take this shit
Don’t invest myself in nothing
These bitches are fake as shit
Fake as shit, faking it
Guess you gotta fake 'til you make it then
Have some down ass bitches from the break and shit
Up from bottom, while I’m taking them

So, sorry bout the last song
I just get a little mad with the passion
Get a little bit fucked, it's cerebral
It just gets a little tough when I’m evil
Just a little more aggressive when I need to
And a little more reflective when I see you
I don’t listen to my pride when it’s tucking
You just finna get aggressive when it feeds you
Aggressive when it fades you
The lesser fucking evil
I ain’t tryna have it all, right? Nah
I’m just tryna make it equal
‘Cus you know me
Bitch you know me
That track yours, better cuff back tight
Fucking everything drop nigga OPP
Yea, come dance with the devil
Screw your head on tight, bitch dance with a rebel
Understand a rose from the thorns and the petal
When you know the game yours you don’t even need a medal
Schoolin these niggas, I might grant you a scholarship
I do it for the passion, you can do it for acknowledgement
The pictures for this fame, I just had to go in proper
Bet I’m on my worst behavior, nigga fuckin no apologies

Worst behavior
Don’t you ever get it fucked up
Worst behavior
Nigga, who is next up?
Yea
Worst behavior
On my Worst behavior
Dirty Gold, bitch
