[Intro: Beyonce]
I’ve been thinking, I’ve been thinking

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
Ya, if I opened my heart and made you a live potion of it's content
Would you drink it
Or would you thank me?
Yeah, to be the one that you call, nope
Be the only one that you want
I done spent time in your zone
And I do whatever they don’t
It’s been a long time since we cut
Deep in thought I drown in my cup
I don’t babysit when I drink so I got me a lot more than a buzz
I get high off of your presence and drunk all on your love

[Beyonce]
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded faded faded
Baby I want you na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty daddy I want you
Na na drunk in love
I want you
We woke up in the kitchen saying how the hell did this shit happen oh babe
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night love
We be all night love
We be all night
And everything alright, no complaints from my body so fluorescent under these lights
Boy I’m drinking park it in my lot 7/11
I’m rubbing
If you scared call that reverend
I’ve been drinking
Get my brain right
Armand de brignac, gangster wife
Louie sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags he wear it out
Boy I’m drinking
I'm singing on the mic with my boy toys
And then I fill the tub up halfway and then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard surfboard
Graining on that wood
Graining graining on that wood
I'm swerving on this
Swerving swerving on his big body been working all this
Surf surfing all of this good good
We woke up in the kitchen saying how the hell did this shit happen oh babe

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
Goodness gracious
Holy smokes you're amazing
I'm just an open letter
You scribbling on my pages
I got bird's eye from my third eye
I've been watching you dance for ages
Been washing wishing waiting, now I’m growing impatient
Drip from my waist till my hips slow down
Got me feeling like a lipso now
Hands in the air put your hands in my hair
When you and I together further things go down
I don’t need a king I don't need no crown
Whole lot of money so the green go plow
Hold up I’m freaking out
That suggest that I need you now
Would've sent this as a text but I guess now my secrets out
Sober thoughts from drinking mouth
Mine’s on you I’m sneaking out
I do say that [shirtless shit?] hold up let me wash my freaking mouth
I be honest I turn up, so I can turn my ego down
I can turn my scene around
Flashing lights and people drown
All the voices in my head telling me to seek you out
I hope you get it now and I hope you hearing this
Baby we drunk in love. Right now we feeling it

[Outro: Beyonce]
We be all night love...
