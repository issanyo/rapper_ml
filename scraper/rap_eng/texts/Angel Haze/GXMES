[Verse 1]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh heaven's fallen, the kingdom's gone
Don't play with love, you know I'd rather be alone
I see the colors, they made you red
I see the imprint of the others in my bed

[Pre-Hook]
Throw the peace sign baby, ashes burn to dust
Look how the trees die baby, passion over lust
Whatever, we tried baby, eh-eh-eh

[Hook]
Baby, I know, I know
Been playing along, no, you can't break my heart
You see, it's cool, it's cool
You can play your games, but, babe, just don't get caught
See, I know, I know
What you are about and you been creepin' on the low
Baby, I know, I know
Bout all your lies, like every single one you've told
Baby, I know

[Bridge]
Said you'd quit your games for me, said you'd quit your games
Said you'd quit your games for me, said you'd quit your games
Said you'd quit your games for me, said you'd quit your games
Said you'd quit your games for me

[Verse 2]
This love is tainted, inside my head
I'm making art with all the colors that I bled
Oh you were perfect, I should've known
All that accusing just to cover up your own

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 3]
You gotta look at the signs
And see that I'm better than bitches around
Swear that I'm sick of the people that cry love
But don't even know what it's 'bout, whatever
Come to my side of the green, come hit my trees
You can't break a real one, flow hard as a steel gun
And all of them fuckin' with me
See I show the fuck up and turn up on the scene
YOLO them bitches ain't nothin' to me
All my opponents are coming up short
Turns out they blind and I'm nothin' to see
Ho, don't act like you ain't fuckin' with me
I took a year off, came back well rested
Yet all you niggas are still soft, I'm flexin'
Nah, I won't talk your ears off, seconds
Wait seconds'll turn into minutes
Wait seconds'll turn into minutes
Minutes millions
Man, I been in hiding, came back with a killin'
Man, fuck it I might do some time for concealment
Yo y'all been deprived for a minute
I still make that crack, still call me the chemist
Put bitches under, still drill like the dentist
All of you lessors are made in my image
It's fuckin' depressing, really ridiculous
The best in the game, they bets put me in Guinness
(Put me in Guinness) bets put me in Guinness
Best in the game, they bets put me in Guinness
