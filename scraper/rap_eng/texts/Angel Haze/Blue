Gone one day, just a memory
Now all I have is the trees
You’re gone away

Sweet was the touch you gave to me
And soft were the words you said to me
And days went by and I cried
Wondered why you went away so soon
Oh

Now I’m sitting here all alone
I’m just an empty space and you’re gone
I never thought this moment would ever come to me

You were my soul mate
Half of me just waiting on the other side
It’s like my heart was torn in two
I’ll never find another you
So help me
I’ll try to find a way to get out
Of this blue…

Out of this blue...
