[Verse 1]
I was born all alone, you the same, babe
I was born all alone, all alone
Naked, we were as we came, babe
Naked we came, we would go on
Oh no, I ain't runnin' in vain, babe
Oh no, I ain't runnin' too far
It's just some beasts from the wild
Can't be tamed, babe
You know, you know who we are

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't know nothin'
Nothin' about us
Nothin' 'bout love or the fears that surround us
But you row the boat that I'm in
You know we'll both sink or swim
Baby, we're drowning, wiltin' like flowers
Chasin' the sun for the love that forgot us
And you know I'm breakin' again
You know im cavin' again
Baby, it's a wild world for you
Moonrise Kingdom only made for two
In these trees there's no escaping truth
They think they're saving you
They think they're saving you

[Chorus]
You gotta run!
Or they'll catch us and stop us from growing
You gotta run!
Hold my love in your heart and keep going
Can't get they hands on it in the kingdom
Can't get they hands on it in the kingdom
Can't get they hands on it in the kingdom
Can't get they hands on it in the kingdom

[Verse 2]
We were young smothered tight in the wolf's jaw
So lost in love, we're running out
We left home, we ran off to the woods awe
The beasts, the beasts, they scarfed us down
We prayed hard to a God that felt so far
We call louder now to no response
Started fires because it got so dark
Oh you said, we'd never smolder out

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't know nothin'
Nothin' about us
Nothin' 'bout love or the fears that surround us
But you row the boat that I'm in
You know we'll both sink or swim
Baby, we're drowning, wiltin' like flowers
Chasin' the sun for the love that forgot us
And you know I'm breakin' again
You know im cavin' again
Baby, it's a wild world for you
Moonrise Kingdom only made for two
In these trees there's no escaping truth
They think they're saving you
They think they're saving you

[Chorus]
You gotta run!
Or they'll catch us and stop us from growing
You gotta run!
Hold my love in your heart and keep going
Can't get they hands on it in the kingdom
Can't get they hands on it in the kingdom
Can't get they hands on it in the kingdom
Can't get they hands on it in the kingdom

[Outro]
I hope you learn to fall in love again
I hope you find a love in your best friend
Just know my heart is yours, until it's end
I want you, now forever, I'll repent
Baby, it's a wild world for you
