Ive been running through the jungle trying to find myself
Murdering any and everything besides myself
With a blueprint nigga i designed myself
And a flow that you bitches can't buy by shelf
Bitch listen, you couldn't get picked if you ducked up
Black belt bars catch a beatin with some nunchucks
Rip your fucking head off stick every single thumb up your ass
And sit back and still leave untouched, yeo i said i still leave untouched
All hail mary mrs never gave one fuck, i dont even really know how i can make it clearer
Only person that can beat me, is in the mirror. so i dun jumped on my own track
Bodied everybody told them niggas hit the road, jack daniels in my cup, all my niggas sippin congnac, with prozac its king haze and bitches Watchin thrones at

And if you sneak dissin watch your whole back, i put you on the ground bitch nigga where your souls at
313 but you can catch me where the dough's at, hold up, peter can you bring the song back?

Sick bitch, chicken noodle soup face
Calls from over seas like a motherfucking crusade
Crack rock and you can hit it till your nose hurts
Rooftop, brooklyn, made this shit in covert
313 but i, i run new york, i run new york

Uh, look, im a motherfucking monster just give me something to spaz
On my foot and shoe's sole is the only beat your ass on
Green in my hands like i got my hulk smash on
All you bitches here, are merely something to pass on
I dont give a fuck, that has always been the motto
Riding roman reggie like a motherucking idol
Ridin around with prezzie like a god damn obama
And i am about the green bitch i need more commas
I do not, see or need no drama, i cannot give a fuck about your ego
Imma god damn boss they will squeeze those llamas
You will run, you will cry you will need your mama bitch
I can't understand for the life of me, why all these ugly rat bitches keep tryin me
Bitch i am a god i am high and defiently, everything you little monkey bitches only try to be
Holdup

Sick bitch, chicken noodle soup face
Calls from over seas like a motherfucking crusade
Crack rock and you can hit it till your nose hurts
Rooftop, brooklyn, made this shit in covert
Nigga im beast, i run new york, i run new york
