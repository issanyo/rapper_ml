I met a man that was
Experienced in pain
He broke my heart but first he
He took my pain
He painted pictures through me
Made 'em so crystal clear
But by the time I got them
He disappeared
Now whenever I get lonely
I tend to close my eyes
I see you so clearly
You're right here by my side
But now that's all behind me
'Cause you got with some other
Girl and now she's got what's mine
But baby you're the love of my life
You disapperead
Love of my life
I need you here
Love of my life
Without you baby
Feel like I sample true love
But isn't it clear
Break break y'all and you don't stop
Until the beat drop and you don't stop
Oh how I wish that this was
Oh just so simple and
We could go back to when we
We first began
I know you love me deeply
Down to my very soul
But when all said and done
You help me grow so
Whenever I get lonely
I tend to close my eyes
I see you so clearly
You're right here by my side
But now that's all behind me
'Cause you got with some other
Girl and now she's got what's mine
But baby you're the love of my life
You disapperead
Love of my life
I need you here
Love of my life
Without you baby
Feel like I sample true love
But isn't it clear
Oh you know you
Rock my world and
You be boy and
I be girl and
It don't stop
Until the break up
Ye I know how I met him now I can't forget him
He said he had to go I couldn't hold him so I let him
I wrote him every letter sent him every text
Even tried to find him lying in the sheets of my regrets
But that was all old and now I'm on some new shit
Flames burnt out find someone to keep it cool with
All said and done love is real when it hurts
So I had to trade it in for whatever it was worth
But
Oh you know you
Rock my world and
You be boy and
I be girl and
It don't stop
Until the break up
Oh you know you
Rock my world and
You be boy and
I be girl and
It don't stop
Until the break up
