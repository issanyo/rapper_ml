Yeah, haze

You are an oceans breeze, I am a title wave
You every paragraph , I'm just the tittle page
You have the heart I hold exactly where you desire it
Its all so effortless, like what you did to acquire it
Each time I find it harder just to keep my composure
I'm tryina show you all of me like indecent exposure
Look, i'll be the gun
You be my holster
I need your love, I need you closer
Seems like forever when only an hour past
We fallin' slower then grains of salt in an hour glass
Emotions runnin' wild
You are who tames them
My only means for tranquility, you my sanctum
And if I could i'd take your eyes and make them blend in with the stars
So whenever we ain't together i'll see still them from afar
But that's insane
I'll do whatever just to feel you
Even all of that don't come close to what I will do
They say love hole the power to
Fulfill you, heal you, kill you, hurt and abuse you
Take away from what you use to
I'm tryina paint a picture, like a canvas plain
To try to put together words like a scrabble game

I said I wouldn't stop until I said what I needed to right? alright lets go

Look, I poured my heart out in an effort just to win you
And I defy my actions solely so they won't offend you
I mean I would wrestle time, even if it get re-winded
Everything you lookin' for, in me is where you find it
So you can stop your searchin' baby
I know you hurtin' baby
Your self-esteem so low sometimes that you feel worthless baby
Okay, you hide it well
But you know I can tell
I see right threw that bullsh*t that you be tryina sell
So let it drop, let it fall
Let it blow with the wind
I told you once, I told you twice and ima tell you once again
That i'll be here,yeah said i'll be here
And, if love is blind, then my mental clear
And all we have is time
And good intentions
F*ck you brake, f*ck your suspensions
Put your foot up on that gas
And drive 'till you don't see your past
I said drive 'till your vision blurs
And let my voice tell our story

Spoken words

F*ck let them hate we where they never was
And f*ckin' Shakespeare couldn't of wrote a better love
But people tell me that I'm trippin, I say you different
And when they ask me how, I can't provide a description, you don't need one
I would disconnect them all, like a broken joint
Just to prove I only see you like a focal point
I know that the distances, may cause complications
But you make me feel good, f*cked up, exonerated
Still I wonder what you like beneath the shackles that you wearin'
I've been longin' to release you from a load that's overbearin'
Tell me, are you protected by your guard boo?
Or could I blow and make it fall like cards do
And I ain't interested 'till it involves you
You got your doors locked and I just saw through
You reached the height of loneliness, cause we all do
But everything that goes up gotta fall to

I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this sh*t at all, fall for your type
I just can't explain this sh*t at all, fall for your type
I believe in people like you
