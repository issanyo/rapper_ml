[Verse 1: Kota the Friend]
Really be in my own zone
Phone ringing, act like I ain't got no phone
Invite me to the party, I'm a no show
All in pastel, something like a rose gold
I ducked the photos
Don't need no four bros
But if I am committed, I give it my whole soul
I’m an old soul
Don't talk to me about politics
I don't like that sort of thing
If you don't like me
You ain't gotta to talk to me
And if you love me then say it
But only if you mean it
I can't take another heart crushing disappointment
Nah nah, nah nah, nah nah

[Verse 2: Kota the Friend]
Yea
I be on my doley, mostly every day
Lotta people phony, that shit ain't okay
You cool with the old me, I am not the same
I don't see the same
Feel like you should know how the seasons change
Oh
I'm at the function, don't know who to trust
That's why my crib is where I'm turning up
Sometimes I be wondering if my girl really fuck with me
Yet I know that she fuck with me, man I'm fucked up
Shit
On my plate, making sure my youngin's straight
People ask me how I'm doing, I just smile and say I'm great
I ain't going back to Palm Tree Liquor, life is what you make
Man I gotta get this cake, really ain't no other way
I said I ain't got time for it if it ain't real
Niggas run they mouth but they always stand still
Think I seen the light coming out the ant hill
Then a hater finna tell me, "homie you an ant still"

[Hook: Kota the Friend & Angel Haze]
If you're down, please tell me what's the deal
See you with a frown, G, I know how you feel
Say when you around me, you can keep it real
Say when you around me, you can keep it real
You can keep it real, you can keep it real
Said when you around me, you can keep it real

[Bridge: Angel Haze]
Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel
'Cause I wanna know you
I wanna know you

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
Uh
Still swerving in the locomotive, yeah
Strayed too far from  hopes and motives, yeah
Tired of leaning broken shoulders, yeah
Weighted on me, motion coasted yeah yeah
Emotions like a rollercoaster
Broke and sober, rolling over
Hold me closer, closer, closer, closer, closer
Yeah, where you at? You really coming over here?
Wait, I keep bringing extra baggage, yeah
Package after package packing, yeah
I'm just tryna make it happen, yeah
I can give you love in fractions, yeah
I just wanna know your free
Open you, open you and open me
Hoping they all believe you're close to free
Holding you, holding you and holding me
Damn!
I got somebody who not from your town
I got somebody who nobody found
I got a yellow boy, fuck like a circus
And he just keep hitting it, fuck if it hurts me
And I just keep reaching man, fuck if it hurts me
I know I'ma get it, I know that for certain
I know that for certain, I know that for certain
I know I'ma get it, I know that for certain

[Hook: Kota the Friend]
If you're down, please tell me what's the deal
See you with a frown, G, I know how you feel
Say when you around me, you can keep it real
Say when you around me, you can keep it real
You can keep it real, you can keep it real
Said when you around me, you can keep it real

[Verse 4: Kota the Friend]
You ain’t gotta act like everything’s okay
Think you hiding but it’s all over your face
People cold, but with me you know you safe
I'mma keep you warm I done seen the storm, this and many more
Ugh!
Love you when you dead broke, love you when you mad rich, love you when you piss poor
Love you like yo fuck it
I’m feeling like we should get lost, get the next flight, more life
Outta sight, outta mind fuck a lie
You ain’t perfect but you try
Give a fuck ‘bout what they say, cause you worth it in my eyes
I don’t care 'bout what you did, 'cause that shit ain’t who you is
Got a heart that’s full of scars, still I wear it on my wrist like a Cuban link
What you know about the shit I’m rocking ?
It’s that new shit, homie you should cop it, it was free
Lil homie it don’t matter what you rocking on your feet
2018 niggas out here finding peace

[Hook: Kota the Friend & Angel Haze]
If you're down, please tell me what's the deal
See you with a frown, G, I know how you feel
Said when you around me, you can keep it real
Said when you around me, you can keep it real
You can keep it real, you can keep it real
Said when you around me, you can keep it real
You can keep it real, you can keep it real
Said when you around me, you can keep it real
