Hey, Momma, remember when we left home?
Damn, I was barely half grown
I kept crying as you sat me on that Greyhound
And tried to reassure me that things would be okay now
But they wasn't, and we both saw it coming, I mean
I was just a kid but I was far from a dummy
And as the pain grew you got more reckless and destructive
Like the time you tried to fight and chase Matt around in public
It was crazy, and I ain't never seen it one way
I just used to think the cops would take you from us one day
And each time I had to be as strong as I could be and more
And take myself to places I had never fucking seen before
Tragic, even in your sanity was madness
You tried to make peace so you could teach me how to grasp it
You should know I'm proud you're doing better for yourself
And that everything you've been made me exactly who I am

And it's you and me, and everything we are is everything we'll be
I swear I'll always love you, I know you feel the same
And I just want to say you made it through the pain

Don't let me go
Set my soul free, let me grow
Don't let me go
Set my soul free, let me grow

Hey, Dee, I know sometimes you fucking hate me
But we've been through a lot and I've been thinking 'bout it lately
We seen a lot of shit some kids should never have to see
Like the shelter, and every night we starved ourselves to sleep
Or like when Daniel used to hurt me and you tried to intervene
Or when I told you I was going to kill you all when you were sleeping
We were crazy, but we had a lot of bad examples
Living how we were living, that's a lot of shit to handle
And every time we turned around it seemed like she was hurt again
Even when she promised us we'd never have to hurt again
And we never had a family
But even with the hatred, we have never not had We
You should know that I'd be here until the curtains close
Even when you lose yourself, here until your hurting goes
You should know I'm proud you're doing better for yourself
And that everything you've been made me exactly who I am

And it's you and me, and everything we are is everything we'll be
I swear I'll always love you, I know you feel the same
And I just want to say you made it through the pain

And don't let me go
Set my soul free, let me grow
I said, don't let me go
Set my soul free, let me grow

Dear little girl inside, everything is fine
We got through all the pain and even got to keep our minds
Sometimes we still get crazy, but not the way we used to
When the love that you know now is nothing you were used to
Sometimes you have to stop feeling sorry for yourself
And love You, that way you can teach anybody else
And if it's pain that you were feeling, you release it till it stops
Or else it will get stronger and just beat you till you drop
You're a lot smarter than you're ever given credit for
Live like a simile, lessons are a metaphor
I hope one day you're strong enough to break free from the cage
And that everything inside you is the reason I be great

And it's you and me, and everything we are is everything we'll be
I swear I'll always love you, I know you feel the same
And I just want to say you made it through to Ra'een
