[Spoken Intro]

[Angel Haze]
"I'm making it for people who just wanna get lost."

[Interviewer]
"This is interesting, how, how music does that, it will just, it's like a... a trapdoor."

[Angel Haze]
"It locks you, in."

[Hook]
No more living in dust
When my memories die
All my trials are rulin' in lullabies
Put my heart on the line
Put my life in the song
Now you, now you, you can sing about me

[Verse 1]
I spent too much time in recording
Spent too much designin' the current
Meet me at the bottom where it started
Promise I revised and rethought it
And I got that, got that, got shit started
Everything's hard and I know it
I got all the scars, I can show it
Never been exempt, but the funny thing is, never really had friends
Just a bunch of down bitches only down for the moment
All of this shit don't end
I lost so much just to win
And that how it goes? Lord knows, I got holes in my soul
But I would do it all again
So what are people mad at me for?
Is it cause they can't jock my free flow?
Is it cause they know no matter how hard they go
They ain't ever gonna stop my dreams though?

[Hook]

[Post Hook]
Somethin' to sing about
Put my heart on the line
Put my life in the song
Now you, now you, you can sing about me

[Verse 2]
I've been straddlin' the line, all my life, just to get me by
But I dreamt of the top, of the sky, dreams of gettin' high
Now everything I say, they gon' feel it
Every words I lay, they gon' hear it
Every single word, they gon' get it
(Let me make sure they remember me)
I tried, it was hard, but I did it
Couple more scars, but I'm livin'
Soon they'll never forget it, never ever forget it, never forget it
(Let me make sure they remember me)
All just survival of the fittest
All just to rhyme for the critics
Everything I want, Imma get it
(Let me make sure they remember me)
I tried, it was hard, but I did it
Couple more scars, but I'm livin'
Soon they'll never forget it, never ever forget it, never forget it
(Let me make sure they remember me)

[Hook] + [Post Hook]

[Bridge]
Name across the sky
And put the world upside down
[?]
And when I'm done with the world, I'm takin' the galaxy
They gonna sing about me
They gonna sing about me
They gonna sing about me
