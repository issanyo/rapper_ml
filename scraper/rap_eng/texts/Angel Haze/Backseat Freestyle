Angel got a dream, ha
Murder everything, ha
Yeah, yeah

All our lives we only wanted to prosper
Nothing compares to them knowing they can’t stop us
Throw your hands up, know anything is possible
This right here be the motherfucking gospel

God damn, I’m still the greatest
Well, I didn’t sit back for ages
Feel I didn’t let time be wasted
And I swear I’m still underrated
Gave purpose to these haters
Told them bitches to follow me
Wasn’t making it easy
Had to force my way in like sodomy
Bitch, now I’m at the top like apostrophe
Made you eat your words, hypocrisy
If Angel ain’t the best hypothesis
Make an equal out of rope, isosceles
Y’all niggas then made this a mockery
Had to let my demons out to leave
Go kill, kill, kill, kill
It’s the motherfucking policy
Now my motherfucking brain is a graveyard
Y’all bitches gonna need a savior
I’m gonna scare the people that made ya
Tell ‘em bitches better keep their day jobs
And it’s my job to kill you hoes
I guess that leaves me to play god
Said it’s my job to kill you hoes
I guess that leaves me to…

All I ever really wanted was the sane heart
And a brain that’s only people saying “dope”
In a world where everybody stay true
Got a bunch of motherfuckers that stay hard
I ain’t fuckin’ with niggas
They all intimidated
You ain’t getting no pussy
Just keep on masturbating
You niggas fuckin’ with Satan
Fuck playin’ with fire
I’m King Hazel up in this bitch
You must now address me as “sire”
Bitches check my attire
All of the finest fabrics
The fuckin’ Angel of Death
If they want it, then they can have it
I’m sorry I’m going manic
Insanity is a habit
Got knowledge of proper English
Profanity just to grab ‘em
Busy getting my weight up
Told them I couldn’t carry ‘em
Murder and pronounce them dead
But my pallbearer up for burial
So fuck whatever you heard
I murder whoever said this shit
My builder make that paper
‘cause poppin’ pussy’s irrelevant
Some of you are intelligent
Most of you niggas can catch a line
If you listen closely
You’ll understand that the time is mine, bitch
Angel got a dream, bitch
Murder everything, bitch

All my life I only wanted to prosper
Nothing compares to them knowing they can’t stop her
Throw your hands up, know anything is possible
This right here be the motherfucking gospel

This just beginning
This is fun
This is 30 Gold, bitch
