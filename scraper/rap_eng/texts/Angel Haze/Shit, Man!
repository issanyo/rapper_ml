[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
You’re never ready for
Something quite like this
It comes to hit you when you
Are least expectin’ it
So now what happens if I choose
To have this child, have a child with you?
Do you believe that we can make it through?

[Hook]
How we gonna do this thing?
How we gonna do it? Shit, man!
We don’t even got no ring
And we don’t got the money, shit, man!
We’re gonna need a bigger house
We’ve got a lot to figure out
How we gonna do this thing?
How we gonna do this thing? Shit, man!

[Verse 2: Skylar Grey]
Sometimes it still feels like
We’re just a couple of kids
Afraid of growin’ up, yeah
Afraid to say ‘this is it’
So now I don’t know what I’ll do
But I’m so in love so in love with you
Can you believe this is happening so soon?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
This ain’t what I expected
Ain’t happenin’ like I thought it
And if they say, “love is free,”
Then tell me why the fuck its costin’
And yes, it happens often and I should cope with my losses
And you say you’re not ready
I don’t believe in abortions
My heart, light as a feather
I know things can get better
I know your vision’s cloudy
So much inclement weather
I know that faith is a string that’s slowly coming untethered
But we can get through anything together

[Hook]

[Outro]
Shit man!
How we gonna do this thing?
Oh shit man!
Shit man!
