[Verse 1:]
I was having nightmares that I would never reach the finish line
If pain is momentary I would never see the end of mine
'Til I realized that these bitches can't touch me
Like I'm a million fucking particles of nothing
Now I walk around like I can't be knocked down
With everything they said I couldn't be blocked out
There was a time where I would've quit and clocked out
You could've stopped me back then bitch but not now

[Hook:]
Cause I know who I am
Finally I'm on to base
I was try'na be like everyone else
Realize that it's not my race
But still uh
Triumph is nothing if it doesn't come from tragedy
So I'mma keep on running with all of you bitches after me
And I'mma keep on coming it's nothing you motherfuckers
Even though on overload I'll function you motherfuckers like
I wanted it all
Finally I got my way
I was having problems with my self back then
But none of that is in my way
And it could be yours
If you want it baby make your way
And you can go far
Keep running baby it's your race, it's your race

[Verse 2:]
I am not the one; tell these bitches don't test me
Cause I can spark off like my last name Leslie
And I can bark off like a motherfucking pet peeve
And put bitches down like a needle up a vet sleeve
God damn I kill it off the exhale
Got bars for life I never ever get bail
And I have never once yet failed
Bitches know I get it cracking like egg shells
I remember when I couldn't call myself real
Couldn't look up in the mirror and not see myself still
Now I'm nothing that you motherfuckers can feel
People speculating like, nobody's just that real
Damn I've been gone full circle
Jumped over moon, stars, cradles and hurdles
You can touch hell and the field won't hurt you
You go through it all to fulfill your purpose

[Hook]
