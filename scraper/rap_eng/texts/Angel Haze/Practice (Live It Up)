[Vers 1: Angel Haze]

Heart broken too often
Love wasted
No potion
Poor baby, don't make a sound
Everybody wanna break you down
I'm broken
Can't hide it
Where the truth at?
Can't find it
They tell me all these lies
No truth in all these lies
Momma says, "Don't give your heart to no man"
But you'd beef for love 'til you got that ring on your hand
Nobody knows nobody knows that
Everybody feels what don't nobody show, so

[Hook: Angel Haze]

Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Break a couple hearts
Leave a couple 'round
Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Break a couple hearts
Break a couple hearts, but don't fall in love, no

[Vers 2: Angel Haze]

Still broken
Fast forward
Feel the pain now
Ignore it
I'm running, but what towards
I don't know, but I'm going
Can't feel shit
That's boring
That's real shit, and you know it
I don't feel more than a little bit
But I rather be a heart breaker than a little bitch
Momma says, "Don't give your world to no man"
But you'd beef for love 'til you got that ring on your hand
Nobody knows nobody knows that
Everybody feels what don't nobody show, so

[Hook: Angel Haze]

Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Break a couple hearts
Leave a couple 'round
Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Break a couple hearts
Break a couple hearts, but don't fall in love, no

[Vers 3: Angel Haze]

I live by the words of a wise man
He said, "Don't go falling in love"
So as much as I can I steer clear of all of that stuff
I fear that I am a little less emotional
Took a couple fuck-it pills
I think that I overdosed
Got a dark side
Shit, you can call it Chromatose
Everybody quick to talk about some shit that they don't know
Fuck what you heard, like I'm fucking what you heard
Like the word's to my clit, and I'm fucking every word
Fucking every verb
Do something for me now
I play dirty like shoes on the muddy ground
I'm too smart where the dudes try to dumb me down
But they get played like blues in the fucking South
I get you open, and choose when to shut you out
Walk up in it like "Guess who's in the fuckin' house?"
Damn, I own it
I own it
Condone it
Heartbreaker
Heart-taker content with my wrong
And I'm scared that I may never make it back
They say they, "I love you"
I don't know what to say to that
I mean, I'm trying
I just don't know what to make of that
I got good intentions, I just don't know where I placed them at
I just don't know where I placed them at

[Hook: Angel Haze]

Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Break a couple hearts
Leave a couple 'round
Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Break a couple hearts
Break a couple hearts, but don't fall in love

Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Break a couple hearts
Leave a couple 'round
Live it up, live it up
Take 'em all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Break a couple hearts
Break a couple hearts, but don't fall in love, no

[Outro: Angel Haze]

Love is a choice
And a chance I can't take
'Cause everything I ever loved
Was one big mistake
I never hurt again
Never feel a bruise
On the next
Forever on the move, uh
