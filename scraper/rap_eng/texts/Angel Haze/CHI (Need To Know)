[Verse 1]
I need to know
That somehow forever is real
And we can grow through whatever we feel
We could be like rose petals, Olympic gold medals
Or pretend we're kids and run through like every field
See, it gets much deeper than we think
Cause sometimes, you don't just fall
It gets much deeper, and you sink
And you're immersed in its love, so nothing else seems to matter
Though there's wholeness in the moment
It's nothing for things to shatter
So, can we break it down to a science
If love is chemistry, then you and I could be its ions
If love is mostly strength, then you and I could be the iron
And we carry the weight 'til it hurts
Do anything to make this shit work
Cause love won't always be easy
I just promise my all when you need it
And you'd be on time when I need you
And we'd vow to always be see through cause
There's no progress without some digression
And love is boring without some aggression

[Hook]
Just believe that you and I are supposed to be together
Baby, put your hands up and we can reach forever
Just believe that you and I are supposed to be together
Put your fucking hands up

I need to know that it's possible to love you
Like they do it in movies, baby
I need to know that it's possible to feel you
Like you're never ever moving
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Cause I love the way you do me
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Hey, baby, we can make it, make it right

[Verse 2]
I need to know that somehow our destiny matters
And that you'll keep my heart intact if the rest of me shatters
And that the things that we endure, we'll effectively master
Baby, this is food for thought off of destiny's platter
See, it takes some pain to make it work
Although diversion could occur, it takes some rock to make it Earth
I need to know that I'm safe within your grasp
And if ever I'm off, that you would race to keep me on track
Cause I would crack the clouds open just to show you heaven
And lift you up when you get down just to show you leverage
And if you've never felt love, I'll make it tangible
And show you how to do it right, I could be the manual

[Hook]
I just believe that you and I are supposed to be together
Baby, put your hands up and we can reach forever
Yeah, supposed to be together
Put your fucking hands up and we can reach forever

I need to know that it's possible to love you
Like they do it in movies, baby
I need to know that it's possible to feel you
Like you're never ever moving
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Cause I love the way you do me
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Hey, baby, we can make it, make it right

[Break]

I need to know that it's possible to love you
Like they do it in movies, baby
I need to know that it's possible to feel you
Like you're never ever moving
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Cause I love the way you do me
I, I, I see, so I believe in you
Hey, baby, we can make it, make it right
