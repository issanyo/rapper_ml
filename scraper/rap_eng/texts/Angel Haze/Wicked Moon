[Hook: Nicole Wray]
Stare at the moon, stare at the moon
Moonlight
Flying, wicked moon

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
Uh, I awoke to the moon
The sun of the night
The stars have all landed
But there's evil in fight
There's screams in my mind
Night's the playground for the demons inside
Thought's the seesaw, and I'm singing with the slide
Mouth the sandbox, and swing's are my eyes
The devil's awake now
He's the prince of the earth now
I can hear every thought, every sound, every rock
Every ground, every creak in the earth now
And he's pleading with me
Tries to bring forth who he thinks I should be
Root of all evil and it's seed is in me
I drift away, and when need I'm asleep and
He tells me to drive, blinded to the elm of the night
Gonna show you what it means to be real
I want you to peel 'til you tear from inside
And I dance with a thought
Feels so good that I dance to the dark
Side of myself and it tears me apart
'Til it becomes the bass and the snare in my heart
He said starve on it
Feel it 'til you die for it
You can run run, but you never ever hide from it
Strive for it, kill to be alive for it
If you ever want it then you look up in the sky..

Stare at the moon, stare at the moon
Moonlight
Flying, wicked moon

[Verse 2]
Uh, he's growing inside me
My continent's shiftin'
My logic is gone, my conscious is missing
My desire is strong
He's all around me like he's tied to my bones
He tells me don't think
He says I won't sleep
I won't be at peace 'til I liven his own
Now spit that blade
Pick it up, now take that blade
Don't trip, put it onto your skin
You can slowly stick it in
You can take my face
You can take my shape
Baby girl, you gon be just like me
Matter fact everything that you touch
They gon fill you in your guts, you a poison ivy
Don't run, don't hide
Don't scream, don't ask for god
Cause he can't help you now
From here out you are mine
And I scream so loud
But he took my voice so he comes out
And the sounds of my sins sound like sounds out his can
Like I'm drowning within whatever he spews out
And he runs me insane
He weighs a ton on my brain
Heat on my skin feels like sun on my face
And I can't take the blame for what he's done in my place
And, breathe deep and I exhale
Leaving me as an eggshell
And I'm cracking from the weight of confusion
From the weight of the fact that I can't tell
Who's who in this moment
Who's truly confirming
And I'm lost in a world
Tossed in a world I don't truly belong in
There's only one way out
My eyes go up and my blade goes down
Load it up, put the gun to my mouth
Pull the trigger, pow
The sun comes out like..

[Hook](x2)
Stare at the moon, stare at the moon
Moonlight
Flying, wicked moon

[Bridge: Nicole Wray]
Babylon don't pull me over
I'm so high
Same clothes from yesterday
I'm so blind
I'm just trying to make it through
Let me by
(The moon is changing, the moon is changing)
Happy go lucky these are my rules
Step to me, you get blasted
I'm insane, I love you
(The moon is changing, the moon is changing)
Changing(x8)

[Outro: Angel Haze]
Everything that happens is a message in disguise
The sun
Will rise
Even if it doesn't
Let this be the darkest time
