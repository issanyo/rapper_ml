Not the type to fall not the type to believe it
I’m the type who just calls whoever right for the season
Me and a couple of friends wearing our tights and our sequins
Out looking for a ball player right for the keeping
You gotta know that its a similar code
Me and you different whips on a similar road
One knee near the ground on your mark, set, go
Either you’re the bitch who run it or you’re just that ho
I tried change and we just clash and collide
And that just resonates the pain and there’s passion inside
And I just try to illustrate when I be asked to describe
How it feels to be an angel with an actual life
Its kinda crazy how I'm partially saying this
Its hard not to get wet when you’re walking in rain
So when love is in the air I put my gas mask on
But there was one I couldn’t help cause it was just that strong
Um, It kinda started off slow and steady
You know, The kinda of love when you just go when you’re ready because
Getting fucked over was a hell of a drain
And um, I was looking for a celibate chain
I was trying to figure out what time could tell
Cause I was walking on clouds, you was fine as hell
Why in the hell do we say that though
Why we can’t start slow and stay that slow
We speed up and crash some collisions and bumps
Take our eyes off the road, end up hitting a stump
Then we stepping out the car just to see who we hit
And long before you know it we be digging’ a ditch
Trying to bury all the wrongs and the sins we commit
Buts its a permanent stain we can't get rid of that shit
I knew that it was love I just didn’t submit
It was something we could fix we just wasn’t equipped
So now we both losing and I’m adjacent to you
Heartbroken and we both claim that we playing the fool
Looking for each other in each replacement we choose
Tell ourselves a bunch of lies until we’re facing with the truth
See what we fail to realize is that we playing a game
And no matter your skill level the play is the same
So until we are advocates of players for change
Love will abuse and put its players to shame
So it tends to get a little reckless here
We skip a couple dinners there and some breakfasts here
We convince ourselves we’re done until the next is near
Cause the heart can’t stop the feelings that I left in there
But you were my first you set the standards for me
I’m just trying to figure out who set the standards for free
So I'm cold and alone for a typical reason
Guess every dog has it's day
And every bitch has it's season
