O-oh, o-oh, oh, oh [x2]

[Verse 1: Green]
Little H.R. in a Minor Threat
With a bad brain, and wants everything
Georgetown Punk, forget what you are
I'm a black cat shreddin' in a U-Haul
Used to be scared of death, I was scared to death
Of being just kept just 'cuz I wore pair of checks
Now I'm makin' real moves 'cuz we started young
Going to rap battles - with guitars and drums
Homie I am from where you need to be
Human rights are sung from the Green in me
I'm a top-notch art kid with rock chops
Yeezy ain't really put me on to no Basquiats

[Hook: Angel Haze]
Oh, oh, hooligans coming
Rude boy lootin' in London
Ain't no one fucking with me
Ain't no one fucking with me
[x2]

[Verse 2: Green]
Black Meadows, I'm a brother still
Got no rims upon my color wheel
Covered in Green, just like Congo
You can't just find me anywhere, Hattori Hanzo
I make rock music, yeah even through
My skin black, real black - Eddie Winslow
Since Nintendo I've been spittin' flows
Headbangin' to Nirvana, now I'm rippin' clothes
Not a hippie, no, I'm a District heathen
I can relate to Cali niggas and the Brooklyn vegans
You be so wrong, I mess you with another
Listen to one song, and think you know a color

[Hook] [x2]

O-oh, o-oh, oh, oh

[Hook] [x4]
