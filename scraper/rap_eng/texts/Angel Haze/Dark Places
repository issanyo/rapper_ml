[Intro]
Since I was young, 'feel I been runnin' out of time
Rage clouding my view
I still picture you, yeah
Many hands have held my heart out over fire
Ain't no one but you
Cold, bandaged, and used
Tender, wild, and racing for your love, out there, oh
I'm still yearning, I'm still chasing for your love, out there
Distant from like everything that was, out there
Ah yeah man, you

[Verse 1]
Got very, very lucky
Hope I get that lucky someday
Meet somebody on a runway
Take their love and cop a one way
Ain't no gods in the world left to me no more
Ain't no limits to how high I reach no more
I don't listen when niggas say preach no more
I just do what I can to feel free no joke
Go to dark places in my head to seek light in 'em
Tryna live my ways without too much spite in 'em
Tryna live my days without too much night in 'em
Get through the night without needing a light in it, chill
I pray for you often, though
I stay where you often don't
You know it get rough when you love out of lust
So fucking much that you lost them both
And I just get lost in my mind
I swear I keep saying I'll find an alternative
Cause that's what you do right?
When life starts to bruise you have to suffer and learn a bit
I feel like a wandering soul with no place in this world
I'm trying but having no luck
I don't have one soul I trust
I'm starting to feel like empty is safer than love
You gotta reach for me man
You gotta touch me and prove that I'm real
'Cause this life is beating me, man
And I gotta give 'em all something to feel

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel about me, feel about me
The day that I'm gone, the weight of the storm
'Cause here in your dark place, in your dark place
The weight is so strong, no place to belong

[Chorus]
But, somehow I bloomed under the moon
But, somehow I bloomed under the moon

[Bridge]
I remember dancin' in the forest to our treetop-love
You and me could be whatever we thought of
Damn, and we didn't ever fear the dark, no

[Verse 3]
I'm trying not to plan things
'Cause I don't know anything
And so many things can change
Cause time don't wait for anything
Or maybe I'm stuck in love
Or maybe this love is pain
Or maybe I was born too broken
With my heart in a choke-hold
Or maybe I was born too strange
Or maybe someone should explain
When they say, "count your blessings"
They mean count your change
We ain't even talking about my aim
Which I've gotten pretty good at man
See I done went toe-to-toe with some fucking giants
They done forgotten where the fuck I stood at man
It's okay to sometimes take that L
You just gotta know how to take that well
See I'm just tryna let the energy guide me
Acknowledge all my faults
Just get rid of the zombies, man

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel about me, feel about me
The day that I'm gone, the weight of the storm
'Cause here in your dark place, in your dark place
The weight is so strong, no place to belong

[Chorus]
But, somehow I bloomed under the moon
But, somehow I bloomed under the moon
