My sound changed, I've overgrown
I'm high and I'm running shit you can call that overflown
Put it to your head and I pop pop pop you can call that overdose
I'm everything I said I'd be I hate to say, I told you so
But fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em cause none of 'em can mess with me
I'm eating, I'm having these rappers malnutrition next to me
We made it, yeah nigga we made it, and I was born in V-town
So it's right that I'm finally famous
Bitch acknowledge the greatest, yeah I said the greatest
I whip 'em until I kill 'em bitch I am verbally sadist
I never thought in a million that I'd be living my dream
So say goodbye to my crew, and say hello to my team

[Verse 3:]
I kill it all, I did this shit
Wanted since a baby girl, on my one in a million shit
I got it, yeah bitches I got it and now I can shred it
Like I'm Reggie or Otto Rocket, I'm getting so out of pocket
My flow is so disrespectful and if you were sleeping on me
I'm Freddy bitch I will wreck you cause I used to be nothing
When dreams of being successful, but now I'm 'bout to head up
So far it look like my neck grew
I'm telling you I'm a vessel, lirically I'm a lector
And bitch I be off the wall like a movie screen projector
And I don't care if they get it, long as they pay attention
I'm all about that inclining, fuck anybody who isn't like
