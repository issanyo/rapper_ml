[Intro: Bastille & Angel Haze]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
This is vocal detection
Front line in open selection
Outlined in open profession
This is his vocal confession
Right now your chords are at war
Screaming you wanted it more
Sit down and master the reference
Right now your voice is a weapon
Wake up to stars in the sky
Watch light revolve with your mind
Watch all the storms rising
And put all your palms in the sky
No more falling to pressure
No more failing acceptance
Throw all your hell towards the heavens
Cause your voice is a weapon

[Hook: Bastille]
And your voice is a weapon
And we’ll do with it what we can
And your voice is a weapon
And we’ll do with it what we can
I’ll fall into your arms again
I’ll fall into your arms again
I’ll fall into your arms again
I’ll fall into your arms

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
We dance with the devil and then
Your halo's the color of sin
The portrait I’m smothering in
Means everything’s lovely again
Nothing’s quite as it seems
Society’s all a disease
Kill all your fear in your sleep
Cause everything’s born in a dream
Breathe in insanity’s grip
Words from insanity’s lips
Falling from sanity’s cliff
Watching your vanity slip
No more falling to pressure
No more failing acceptance
Throw all your hells towards the heavens
Cause your voice is a weapon

[Hook: Bastille]
And your voice is a weapon
And we’ll do with it what we can
And your voice is a weapon
And we’ll do with it what we can
[I’ll fall into your arms again
I’ll fall into your arms again
I’ll fall into your arms again
I’ll fall into your arms

[Bridge: Angel Haze & Bastille]
Pressure that deepen the cut
When will the evil erupt?
Volcanic feverish lust
That shit will even it out
Pressure is feeding the dust
Reckless is keeping the cut
Vengeance is me speaking up
This is me speaking up
And your voice is a weapon
This is vocal confession
And we're shooting you down, down, downAnd your voice is a weapon
This is vocal confession
And we’re shooting you down, down, down

[Hook: Bastille]
And your voice is a weapon
And we’ll do with it what we can
And your voice is a weapon
And we’ll do with it what we can
[I’ll fall into your arms again
I’ll fall into your arms again
I’ll fall into your arms again
I’ll fall into your arms

[Coda: F*U*G*Z & Braque]
Choose your voice and etch that on your soul
Make them heard when crowds drown out your call
Leave behind your questions, silent thoughts, and mentions
The wake has to be left, so never falter
Your voice is a weapon
So do with it what you can
Your voice is a weapon
So do with it what you can
Leave behind your questions, silent thoughts, and mentions
Your voice is a weapon
So do with it what you can
