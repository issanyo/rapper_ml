Look, I am a mess and my life kinda sucks now
I know I am gone, but I don't give a fuck now
Cause in my mind when I see you with another bitch
I go insane, I just throw a fit
And now I am yelling, screaming "Hell no!", throwing shit
I'd kill a bitch, and you know this shit
But that's the price you gotta pay, when it don't cost
I try to tell myself it was yo lost
But it's my lost, its just yo fault
Nothing's mine now, this is yo heart
Take out and you can see, it beats for you
Cut me open, I'd even fucking bleed for you
You wanna leave me, you can't go now
You saying "Let go", but I don't know how
I gave you everything in my heart and head
But the only way you leaving is when you're dead

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

Ah, now I am thinking a million things at once
I want you back now, and I can't front
Roger that, 10-4, did you copy?
You won't be with a bitch who is not me
Cause I will leave with your dick, you will not pee
Cut your eyes out, Hitler... Nazi (not see)
Cut that bitch up, cook her, Chinese
Us together, forever, Siamese
Damn, a lil gone with my thoughts vague
I know your thoughts too, this is not Haze
Love and logic can not exist together
And since I can't have both
I'mma pick the better
Take it all, take it all, you don't have a choice
Yell and scream till you don't have a voice
Punch walls, go ham, you could hurt me
But don't leave me, cause that's the worse thing

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love , to hold , to feel , to breathe , to leave you...

Hold up!
I just, I don't know if I need to say this
I mean, like, I understand that I've done wrong
But, my fucking heart is yours, and I can not lose you, like I don't
I am in love with you, I am just crazy
I am...

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me
