[Verse 1: Woodkid]
Where the light shivers offshore, through the tides of oceans
We are shining in the rising sun
As we are floating in the blue, I am softly watching you
Oh, boy, your eyes betray what burns inside you

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
You were a maze to never be completed
And I fell through cracks in all your little secrets
But your grip won’t let me free and
Closed eyes won’t let you see
That out of everything you are arises mystery
Back to the intro, back to the back
Of the back of the door I watched you close
Colors washed by the endless tides
By the end of the cycle faded slow
Back to walls with the holes punched in
By the ends of a fist with knuckles swole
Back to the chick that lost control
Back to the pain that can’t be shown

[Hook: Woodkid]
Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me, too?
'Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves, I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?

[Bridge: Angel Haze]
Everything I feel for you, swallowed salted tears for you
Is there any chance you can feel this, too?
Now my heart’s a bid for you, you put all your quid onto
I just want you to make me a part of you, you, you

[Hook: Woodkid]
Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me, too?
'Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves, I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
Or can’t be seen or can’t be felt
Or can’t be shared with no one else
I chose my shade, I made it green
I lost myself when I made your team
Back to the name I’ll scream forever
From a place that can’t be home
Safe from the grasp of the rage ensued
By a thought process that can’t be slowed
Where I'll be when you realize, I can’t say
But dawn goes down to day and nothing gold can stay
But dawn goes down to day and nothing gold can stay
But dawn goes down to day and nothing gold can stay

[Hook: Woodkid & Angel Haze]
Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me, too?
'Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves, I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?
