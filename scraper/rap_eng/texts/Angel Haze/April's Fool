[Intro]
April's Fool

[Verse 1]
Dead skin on the flesh of your halo
Drunk love on the breath of an angel
Time frozen in the ash from your blunt
And you breathe like you had life trapped in your lungs
And you wanted escape, and I wanted to take
Every thought from your mind and just throw it away
As I've watered you've grown
I've deflowered your soul
You a seed that I planted with a thought of a rose
And I thought I'd impose if I ever had the energy
And I would save somebody if I ever had the memory
I cleared up some space and invited you in
You were brown and I tried to make you violet again
And I brought out the sun and the violence of wind
And I tore off your thorns and they died in my skin
Yeah
And I watched you, become beautiful
It's funny what the dirt does, when it's suitable

[Pre-Hook]
I don't mind being April's fool
The flowers came when the rain made you
Honest hours having spent with few
But I'll be April's fool for you and

[Hook]
I'm April's fool
And a rose grew from the concrete with a heartbeat
And I took you to the grass and made its bed
Then I bathed you in my love until it sprouted
And I'll never get the thought out of my head
I'm April's fool

[Verse 2]
Yo
Freeze frame cause the view is so cinematic
And the opening to you was so hemorrhagic
But my first mistake was thinkin it was easy
And that you'd love me if I really let you see me
Deep thoughts in the abyss of your brain cells
One shot to wherever your pain's held
And it became something I'd never seen before
And now my heart too small to beat for anything but yours
Though my perception's is varied as your shade change
And the burdens gettin heavier than weight gain
And we kept swallowing the sun until the shade came
And kept on knockin on the clouds until we made rain
All the flowers in the garden share the same range
And a rose by any color share the same name
But I love you in a way that will not cease
Cause you're hideous in ways I cannot see

[Pre-Hook]
I don't mind being April's fool
The flowers came when the rain made you
Honest hours having spent with few
But I'll be April's fool for you and

[Bridge]
I'm April's fool
If we take the flowers stem and walk into the rainbow
Remember to water them and watch how quickly they grow
But as quick as clouds come in and drown them in the rain so
We can take the potters  and anoint them with the same ho
And a rose grew from the concrete with a heartbeat
And I took you to the grass and made its bed
Then I bathed you in my love until you sprouted
And I'll never get the thought out of my head


I'm April's fool
