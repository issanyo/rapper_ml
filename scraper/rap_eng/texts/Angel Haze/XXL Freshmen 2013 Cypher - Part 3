[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I tried to take the time to become someone's inspiration
Turnt up to the max, but talked about education
Preached how marijuana was the healing to the nation
Tatted Bob Marley face to help me through all my phases
This living life shit is startin' to take a hold on me
Started out with verbalizing poetry
Murdalizin' any instrumental anybody tried to throw at me
And that's when hip-hop started to grow on me
You could say that I'm proud, cause I wasn't followin' crowds
I was stuntin' on all them niggas that was runnin' they mouth
Surpassed my expectations on anybody with doubts
Feedin' niggas the truth, why you niggas lookin' spoofed?
The beginning to gettin' what I deserve
Cause in this life of sin, you only winnin' when it's earned
So niggas gettin' handouts is liable to burn
Yeah, you could shine now, but it's probably gon' die down
So when it quiet down for the day
And you broke cause throwin' money seemed cooler than tryin' to save
Nigga be a man, make a plan, be a better nigga and
Try to find a way to make a way, keep it G

[Verse 2: Logic]
I keep it real all the time
Like my crew when I rhyme
Just a killer in his prime with that predator state of mind
I'm set to detonate
Stack my bread and watch the paper escalate
Don't test my fate, Logic finna blow like Mary Kate
I play my role like Shakespeare, RattPack ain't no fakes here
I conceal my talent like a 357
Ever since I was 11 been a G, chillin' on the low key
Incognito, manipulate the steel like Magneto
Smackin' suckas like mosquitos, dispersin' verses like a free-throw
I'm Michael, the king, you fuckers is Tito
Versace frames with the green shades, I only see dough
Ballin' like a free-throw, you know my steelo
I once was a prince with the vision of a king
Now I run the whole thing, not defined by the bling
Exterminatin' fakes like crooked jakes killin' for high stakes
Guaranteed that it's my fate to be remembered as one of the greats
No matter what it takes, boy I'ma give it my all
Like Jordan when he ball, never stumble, never fall
Lyrical medicine, repeat the formula until I get it right like Edison
Now step into my mind as I calculate lyrics like Einstein
The way he manipulated numbers, I manipulate the rhymes
Like E equals MC squared, na
E equals eater of MCs, beware
Watch me shine in the darkness like a flare
Married to the game, I'm the heir to the throne you've been watchin'
I know a lot of people lookin' at me
Like "Who the hell this white boy reppin' VMG?"
Racially I'm no different from Cole or Young Drizzy
Just a half-breed born to succeed, now what you need?
Visionary, RattPack, Young Sinatra

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
I am like magic, I am a classic
Puttin' heat to these bitches like I'm ironin' fabric
Can't satisfy the appetite of a savage
So I'm eatin' 'til I'm at the top, openin' passage
Openin' passage always so drastic
I, kill the shit and have them bitches holdin' a casket
I am on point, bitch I'm verbally cactus
And it's my turn now like a rotating axis
Tell 'em I don't hold my tongue for no one
I'm a fuckin' asshole, so forth, so on
And I rap circles 'round bitches, I got 'em runnin' in relays
Had they jaw dropped in the same position for three days
I hear them hoes hatin', I got a proposition
Until you come, hoes, you ain't no competition
I put bitches in a bag, be next
I'm comin' up like gag reflex
These bitches on my sack, t-dip
I'm givin' out sneak previews, free clips
Y'all bitches don't want the drama
I end your sentencin' like colon, comma
Call me misses take the lead to these bitches
On tracks like glue to the weave of these bitches
I take 'em all in like I'm breathin' these bitches
Then put a couple drinks up the sleeves of these bitches
I'm killin', best believe I make 'em bleed in these stitches
I can't believe you really be believin' these bitches
Damn, dead is how I'm leavin' these bitches
Watch 'em all get sonned like I'm breedin' these bitches
