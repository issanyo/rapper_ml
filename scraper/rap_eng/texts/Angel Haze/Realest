[Hook]
Triller than the trillest
Fuck that bitch the realest
Middle fingers up
It's like motherfuck your feelings
I said triller than the trillest
Fuck that bitch the realest

[Verse 1]
Ok I'm number one tell who tack it
I'm back up on my shi-shi-shit
Suicidal self got them bitches like
Back up off my wrist wrist
My team is too exclusive
Your team is full of actors
Bitch I'm a fucking movement
Yeah I'm practically the casher
We might be out in Vegas
Next week we in Tabago
I swear we fucking hungry bitch
We eating off your table
Got a million dollar plan
And the skit's so plain
Money on my mind and the shit gon' rain
Whole bunch of bitches tryin' to do it like I can
But can't do it like I can cause their shit's so lame
Your shit's so lame
To get like me, you gotta twist your brain
Bitch twist your sane
If your shit's hash, my shit's cocaine
My shit cocaine, don't pay no mind, my shit no brain
My shit so edgy, shit so classic
I'm orthodox, my shit's so vain
Y'all niggas don't understand
But still under my ass like underpants
And I'm over y'all ass like smothering
And I'm smothering and I'm covering
I'm covering my tracks
Telling bitches better watch their back
Tell 'em hoes I'm about my money
Tell 'em bitches better have my stacks

[Hook]
Triller than the trillest
Fuck that bitch the realest
Middle fingers up
It's like motherfuck your feelings
I said motherfuck your feelings
I'm realer than the realest
Middle fingers up
Bitches, motherfuck your feelings

[Verse 2]
Like off in the world I was made to shine
And I'm about to blow up like grenades inside me
Y'all lil' motherfuckers that the way you talk
And everything I spit, hot like Satans alive
The greatness, they less I'm awesome peak
And I don't wanna wait bitch, Dawson's Creek
Thinking I put us together, we are not conjuction
Think you looking like a meal bitch, high consumption
Way too many screws lose connected like Bluetooth
Writing on a pad bitch connected like Blue's Clues
Too real, and yeah I'm nasty like school fool
Greatest and the latest looking at me like who's who
Damn they looking at me like, who's who?
Bitch, I'm looking at you like, who you?
I know I'm the best digging anybody's grave
I ain't the next nobody, I'm the first Angel Haze, nigga

[Hook x2]
Triller than the trillest
Fuck that bitch the realest
Middle fingers up
It's like motherfuck your feelings
I said motherfuck your feelings
I'm realer than the realest
Middle fingers up
Bitches, motherfuck your feelings
