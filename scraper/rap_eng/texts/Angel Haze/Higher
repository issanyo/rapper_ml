[Intro: Angel Haze]

Can we just get higher up, hey
Can you take me higher up, hey

[Vers 1: Angel Haze]

Can we just get high?
Then find each other
Through each others thighs
Find new life through each others eyes
Fuck til' it hurts, til' I make you cry
Can we just get low?
Then find us in each others soul
Get deep enough that we gotta float
I mean get deep enough til' we establish hope
In us, cause I know you gotta be tired
Cause I know you tired of theses lows
And I know you wanna get high
And I know everything you desire
I'm the only person that can give it to you
I know your secrets buried deep and I know
You want me to dig into you
Scratch all on my soul
My tongue on all your braincells
We carry on, you get the message
I'm straight for it like a chain mail
You on fire, I lick your skin
And I taste hell
Clothes ain't needed where we goin'
Drop a lot like your weight fell
Give me 1 minute
Make it to the top
Everything I am made me what you not
We perfect for each other
Need a new fit, perfect for the weather
Up and away, escape through a maze in a mind
Amazed what I find
Can we stay high like
We take it to the sky
Can you make me fly like
Can you take me high like

[Hook: Angel Haze]

Higher up
Can you take me high like
Can you take me high like
Can you make me fly like, hey hey
Can you make me fly like
Higher up
Can you take me off
Can you lift me up
Can you take me off
Can you lift me up
Can you pick me up
I want your love
But you kissin' up
To make me feel like that
Make me feel like that
Higher up
I want your love
Can you make me feel like that

[Vers 2: Angel Haze]

Can we just get to know each other
I mean you can know whatever
So far beyond physically
When I touch you it's like I'm feelin' me
I mean really like I'm feelin' peace
With myself with the enemy
We can be best friends there to the depth
But I fuck you like my enemy
Can we get so close that
The heat from our body
Run the air to toast
I mean get so close that
The air to smoke
I mean get close enough that
We can turn the air to ghost
We can feel our heart beat to the same tune
We can share the same air in the same room
There's a whole lotta pain we just may do
Cause if ain't about me then it ain't you
See that's what the fuck I'm talking about
Cause I know you real, and I know you got it
If chances you ain't for me then I track it
Down and fuckin' shot it
Just time, space in between us
No past pains to mislead us
Higher up, higher up
No gravity
In between us

[Hook: Angel Haze]

Higher up
Can you take me high like
Can you take me high like
Can you make me fly like, hey hey
Can you make me fly like
Higher up
Can you take me off
Can you lift me up
Can you take me off
Can you lift me up
Can you pick me up
I want your love
But you kissin' up
To make me feel like that
Make me feel like that
Higher up
I want your love
Can you make me feel like that

[Vers 3: Angel Haze]

Cause I've been close before
I mean really fuckin' close before
Everything I love leaves
And I really don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like dirt no more
So baby, come make me clean
Can we make our word a bond
And only say what we mean
Gotta whole lotta love to give
And gotta past that just won't leave
Can I be the one to open yo' eyes
Cause you get what you see
And I want you to see what I am
See everything like spy cam
I want to see what's down in my soul
And make the message instant like I AM
Cause honestly I'm tryin' give you
What's best of me and
Good love is hard to make
If truth ain't no recipe
Come rescue me
Come clean what's left of me
Your my escape
Your my drug
Human ecstasy
[Hook: Angel Haze]

Higher up
Can you take me high like
Can you take me high like
Can you make me fly like, hey hey
Can you make me fly like
Higher up
Can you take me off
Can you lift me up
Can you take me off
Can you lift me up
Can you pick me up
I want your love
But you kissin' up
To make me feel like that
Make me feel like that
Higher up
I want your love
Can you make me feel like that
