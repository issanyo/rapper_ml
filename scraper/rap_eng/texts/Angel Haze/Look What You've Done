[Speaking:]
Kinda wanna talk about myself today
We'll call this shit honesty hour
Yeah, alright

[Verse 1:]
It's like mid '91 and I'm her growing pains
And she saying
"You should change, you don't have to go that way"
But then you walk out and you do you
And you telling her that you knew
You would do something that day
Even though, I was on my way
And it hurts me cause you knew that
You took the pistol, you pulled back
Didn't think that nigga would of fought back
Didn't think one shot could of caused that
And I hate you, I hope you know this shit
Tears wanna fall, lemme hold that shit
Get what you give when you sold that shit
Can't really understand how we go that quick
I used to pray that God would give you a second chance
You know, maybe then you would be a better man
But, you dream until you realize
Everything runs, especially the tears cry
Even after all of the years I, probably never know what it feels like
Damn, and you don't know what I've been through
If Hell is where they sent you
Then dare I say, that I've been too
And maybe we were together for a moment
Even though I never really shown it
Every cut hurts so much more
When there ain't nothing to put on it
And boy you should of seen my mom
Got hurt, but she did a damn good job
I was one of the smartest in my class
Dad, I worked so damn hard
And I got through it all
Even when they hurt and raped me
But I can't let go of the thought that
You probably could have saved me

[Hook:]
But I got it (I got it)
(Yeah)
Cause pain hurts but it heals too
And after all this shit that I've been through
I got it (I got it)
(Yeah)

[Hook:]
Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done for me
(Oooh, yeah yeah)
When life's hard, it means something
You get through, you gon' be something
You got it (you got it)
(Yeah)
Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done for me

[Verse 2:]
It's like '06, 6:30 in the early A
My mom wakes me and my brother
And says that we're going away
And then my stomach tightens
My heart drops, then I start to shake
And we pack up and before long we were on our way
And I, just keep remember thinking
Why the fuck do we gotta keep leaving?
Why does everybody wanna fucking hurt us?
Someone give me a good reason
Then I looked to the left and seen those tears on my mother's face
And I thought somewhere inside
She was just wishing herself to another place
And we ain't have no where to go
So they put us in a shelter
Seemed like no matter where we looked
Nobody could really help us
And we ain't have no food
Nothing in my stomach for like 30 something nights
Never saw it coming, I got perfect fucking sight
My mother cried on her knees like every fucking night
And nothing really hurts like that
You ever feel like dirt like that?
Did you ever lose your worth like that?
Then you don't know the hurt I got
And you don't know the work you got
That's what my mom would always say
When the devil try to bring you down
God would send all these ways
How did she have all that faith?
I swear I would of given up on it
But even after all that pain
She was still there, on her knees, calling
And I don't really get that
I was never fully with that
But every time she called on God
He was always quick to get back like

[Hook:]
You got it
(Yeah)
Cause pain hurts but it heals too
And after all this shit that I've been through
I got it (I got it)
(Yeah)

[Hook:]
Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done for me
(Oooh, yeah yeah)
When life's hard, it means something
You get through, you gon' be something
You got it (you got it)
(Yeah)
Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done for me

[Bridge:]
(Uh, yeah)
You knew that I was gon' be something
You stressed out and you need something
I got you
And when life's hard, it means something
You go through, you gon' be something
You got it

[Verse 3:]
It's 2011, I'm crazier than I ever been
And I still get blessed, yeah blessed, like I never sin
And I think I feel good about myself again
It just get hard sometimes, when you feel like you never win
I know, boo hoo, sad story
Young and addicted to that glory
Never thought that love could hurt me
I never predicted that it could be that gory
But I still give my all
Yeah I still give my all
Til the sky becomes the sea
Til everything in heaven calls
Gotta stay strong
I gotta let down my guard
Gotta let them see my truth
Gotta let them see my scars
Yeah, look what they've done
Look what they've done
What I've become (hey)
