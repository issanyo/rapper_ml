Team Haze… Uh Angel Haze… Maybe its my Maybe its my Maybe its my swag bitch
Look I give a fuck about whoever
Bitch I’m better I don’t care about em’
Maybe I’m just deaf because I never Hear about em’
Name your favorite rapper I bet this year you gon’ see me top em’
And all these bitches gon’ let me in they bikini bottoms
And all these haters gon’ say she gay she wack
And insignifigant others gon’ say that’s haze get smacked
Body guards go ludacris like get back! get back!
And fans faint for my presence no gift wrap
Its that, real shit I be talkin’ Don’t just talk and my feet walkin
All these solelss niggas feet barkin’ like the bought they sneakers from target
Get sick not better nigga, Get  on my level nigga
I’m a fucking flintstone you a pebble nigga
Bitch I ain’t a noobie spit so toothless, I’m ruthless
Can’t none of ya’ll nigga birth me like I yanked out yo uterus
Paid on the regular but I’m trying to be super rich
Answer My money get that stupid shit stupid bitch
Native American Trend setting veteran
Howl on these bitches like the wolf pack severer
I’m head of my team bitch Captain spot letterman
I’m heading to the top where I’m beheading them
Uh, I’m where the truth lies
You where the truth missing
Most of these rappers should be wherever the booth isn’t
You either failed class or did some school skipping
Rappers are the reason you should stay in school children
I mean I’m fucking serious Y’all like some fucking toddlers
You like the wizard of oz I’m harry fucking potter
And My big brother told me You the best nigga
Don’t let nobody else tell you nothing else nigga
I look up in the mirror and be like self nigga
Be you not nobody fucking else nigga
I mean you know it right you better then the rest nigga
And If they love you then they love you for your self
Now, Gone and run that shit back and tell me who the fuck I’m not better then
And I do my own stunts bitch jackie chan
Iron man bars
Bitch I’m so hard
If they won’t let me up in this bitch then I broke guard
