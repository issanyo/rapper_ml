[Verse 1]
2014, the year I died
Now I'm resurrected like Jesus Christ
I mean, y'all can tell by the shit I drive
When the doors go "Ah" like frequent flights
I mean, look inside my crib, look inside my whip
Big old body men and I can't drive for shit
If I phone home it's a spaceship
Nigga, and my budget was a motherfuckin' facelift, nigga what
Anyway, fuck what you heard and shit
I'm from 7 mile, I make urban shit
And my homies all fuck suburban chicks
But I just keep it player with my urban bitch
I'm yellin' "D-day, d-day, d-day, d-day, d-day"
You a broke bitch, I don't relate, relate
Before I even show up they gotta prepay, prepay
Man your time runnin' out, bit relay, relay, relay

[Chorus]
I just bought an island wildin' crib
So big they doubled up the brokers fee
Bitches see me park or go wild and be screamin' "Hey Professor Oglevee"
Exes, flexin', sexin', textin'
I don't really care, I caught me a colder piece
I just let my shit get so strong, can't nobody here hold me?
Yeah, resurrection, woo
Damn, my perfection
I just doubled down and made them niggas learn their lesson
I was like "Yeah, resurrection", woohoo

[Verse 2]
2016, the year I rise
Like the Phoenix, yeah man, my shit on fire
Copt the new McClan just to sit outside
And if you disrespect me yea the clique gonna ride
Wait, please dont front all my shit lke that
Woah bitch don't touch, hold my shit like that
Lost all my soul just to get that plaque
And it took way too long for me to get that back
Wait, not that I say I regret it
We only fuck if you match my aesthetic
Wait, I think they all just rejecting
Hate what you not and that shit is pathetic
Wait, I just threw out my perspective
And I guess that got some power to it
I just mapped out a direction
Then I drove like 30 hours to it

[Chorus]
I just bought an island wildin' crib
So big they doubled up the brokers fee
Bitches see me park or go wild and be screamin'
Exes, flexin', sexin', textin'
I don't really care, I caught me a colder piece
I just let my shit get so strong, can't nobody here hold me?
Yeah, resurrection, woo
Damn, my perfection
I just doubled down and made them niggas learn their lesson
I was like "Yeah, resurrection", woohoohoo

[Outro]
No one, no one, no one can save you now
You die upon the devil, raise you now
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Resurrection
No one, no one, no one could save me now
I die upon the devil, raise me now
And call me nothing new
