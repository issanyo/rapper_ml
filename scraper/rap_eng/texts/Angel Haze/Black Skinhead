(Verse)
Back in the booth and I'm bout to attack
Nothing but Jesus was holding me back
All of you bitches been lyin on tracks
And I'm modest but right now its time after that
Who are these bitches? They wastin my time
Doing nothing constructive, they wasting the grind
I'm exposing you frauds because i feel its time
Then I'm peelin' your skin back and chewing the rhind
Everyone know ain't no stoppin my shine
Punchlines that feel like a blow to the spine
Came from the dirt, from the bottom i climbed
And i climbed up that bitch till im outta my mind
Call myself Angel 'cus that be the goal
Stay draped in black cause it matches my soul
Swear i be rhamses way I'm wrapped in gold
Versace, Versace, you already know
I haven't opened my mouth in some months
I just sat back and kept watchin you front
I just sat back and kept letting you stuck
But that silence was silently callin your bluff

(Hook)
Why you still going? You still boring
Zz Zz Zz I'm still snoring
This morning I woke up with a foreign
Thing that can only be seen when I'm touring
Baby I swear I'm the best bitch who doin it
Fuck all the critics, they blind and too stupid
All of this vision of mine is so lucid
All of this passion I got is so ruthless
That all of you bitches are now rendered useless
Yeah you're now rendered useless

(Verse)
Cry for competition
Or just different people who make better music
And that's just in general
Said that's just in general
I'mma fuckin straight shooter
This shit ain't no beef and I don't do subliminals
(GOD)

(Hook)
Why you still going? You still boring
Zz Zz Zz I'm still snoring
This morning I woke up with a foreign
Thing that can only be seen when I'm touring
Baby I swear I'm the best but you doin it
Fuck all the critics, they blind and too stupid
All of this vision of mine is so lucid
All of this passion I got is so ruthless
That all of you bitches are now rendered useless
Yeah you're now rendered useless
Dirty Gold  bitch
