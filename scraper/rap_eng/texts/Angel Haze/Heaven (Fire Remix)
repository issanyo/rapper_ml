If eternity is a gift, reality is the present
Maybe Heaven is just one big lesson
If trying is effort and hardship and essence
Then, maybe its nuclear
Maybe I'm just a weapon
And maybe my neglectence was really affection
What ruined it for me was bended perception
See, in my church women fucked with pastor
To make it okay, he would fuck up the lecture
So, what do I believe in?
The scriptures that readin', the bibles, the chapters, the verses, the meanin'
Naw, what I'm askin' for is deeper than clarity
My mom survived, but she struggled through therapy
How do you ignore the signs?
How the fuck you ignore the crime but punish the victim that can't afford to pay the fuckin' fine

Have a child that [?] their minds and tell them it ain't bravery
Lock those words behind the cell and force them into slavery
Stripped them of originality, dressed them in conformity
Tell them that their differences are blatant mass deformities
Ripped their vocals from their throat to give them someone else's voice
Tell them that it hurt you too, but you don't really have a choice
Let them lose themselves, abuse, misuse themselves
'Cause they were denied the option to choose themselves

I hate this world
It's so fuckin' cold
That's why I feel with my heart but live with my soul
But this world, this world is still my home
And heaven's a place I haven't gone
Could it be a method, used to restrain you
I've seen hell like Satan's guardian angel
And that's why I do anything to get outta here
God's a magician that won't let me disappear
So take me away from here
Judge me by everything but my mistakes of fear
Cause so many won't make it here
No, they won't make it here

If heaven was a mile away, I would try to let it come to me
Prove that God loves me, let him bring the sun to me
Come search for me so I stop tryin' find you
If heaven is real, let you be my reminder... Let him be my reminder
If heaven is real, let him be my reminder
(Speaking a different language)
Creations are half of designer
So if heaven is real, you can be my reminder
