[Intro]

Shout out DB, Shout out JW, Yeah

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]

Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
Hit up the web site that's versus Versace
Then click on the homepage and sit there and watch me
God, I got so much swag, boy
Now I don't even get mad when they jock me
Now that they watching my fashion
I switch up the style just to watch bitches copy
Album is done, and they working on floppies
Soon as you finish they sell it and [?]
Good with my genes, [?] no one can stop me
Tree stomping on bitches, I'm chopping them up
Killin em all, I'm rain dancing in blood
Really that mean I think talking is cheap
And honesty, bitches been talking too much
I ain't talking enough, bet that silence is loud
I know that I got it and none of that shit is worth rhyming about
Anyway fresh off the runway, said fresh off the runway
I get it like Mumford was docking
Fresh out the campus, call that photoshopping
And I never paid a red cent out my pocket

[Outro]

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
