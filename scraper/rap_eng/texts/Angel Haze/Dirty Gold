[Bridge 1 / Intro]
Take a breath, say you love me
We both know that everything changes

[Verse 1]
Keep in mind that none of this is fiction
This is just a glimpse into the head of a menace
We were two different children
But we born of the same moon
Blowing entire opposite
We were brought up the same too
I used to hate you because they celebrate you
And you made them notice every single thing I can’t do
But really I honestly wanted to be you
And I just hope my desire to wasn’t that see through
I never took into account the things that you were hiding
I even understood your rage when I see you get violent
I guess the height of all my envy was leaving me blinded
Until you sat me down and told me how crazy your life is
You said to run and never look back
And if I did, to never lose track of all the hurdles I was jumping
That lead me to my current goal

[Hook]
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold (3x)

[Bridge 2]
Took a chance, said you’d love me
We both know that everything changes

[Verse 2]
You found me when I was dying and unappreciated
You broke me down into a science that I completely hated
You told impeccable talent didn’t make me less average
But how I use it to my advantage determined my passion
It took some time to understand and manage
But then I learned this passion was the method to my madness
And I never got to thank you, at least not in the way I planned
But I had to learn before I did that, I hope you understand
It takes a lot for me to bury hatchets but consider them cremated
All the ashes burned to ashes
And I’m dusting off my vocal box and finally saying thank you
And even though you ain’t my fan, you did the shit they ain’t do
So disregard my temper and the times I fucking hate you
Because despite all my ignorance I’m really fucking grateful
Never forget the importance of the spot you hold

[Hook]

[Bridge 3]
Took a glance, towards the mirror
Now I know that everything changes

[Verse 3]
I used to hate me, I swore my life was too painful
Let my demons overtake me before I fight with my angels
There was constantly a struggle to see my life at an angle
That provided understanding of how much drama could change you
I used to cut myself open just to feel like I was living
But when living is just dying then there’s no longer a difference
There’s no longer existence, and there’s no longer persistence
And there’s no longer a drive there existing on only division
And I thought, if nobody ever loved me
This vacancy inside me must be really called a bloodstream
Then I looked into the world and saw a million people like me
Probably never know your stories, but you’re the reason I’m fighting
You’re the reason I’m writing; music
Could be so reviving
And if ever you tend to forget, I’m right here to remind you:
Don’t ever give into the hurt you hold

[Hook]
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold (3x)
