[Spoken Word intro: Angel Haze]

There are weights upon my heart, heavy as amplified grief
The bags beneath my eyes have seemingly swallowed my sleep, my
Mind is racing..pacing alongside my thoughts of restitution
The thoughts I have of finding a place to escape myself
To escape this world, to escape this pain and it's
Milky Way swirls of torture and torment and lacking of progress, I
Digress constantly and I'm particularly numb now
My mind is a galaxy. My heart is a fortune cookie, full of verbs that say Go!
Jump. Fight. Win, but my soul is held captive by this state I'm within, I fight
Wars amongst Gods. Amongst demons and angels
They're more strengthened than I, more sharp and more angled, more
Capable than me, yet I've
Never found the ability to allow my hope into reclination
I've been from the bottom to the top with a forceful desperation
With a need that can match the longing of a thousand suns
A thousand tongues wishing for what we know is love, I
Know nothing but struggle, the constant
Hustle and bustle of attempting to make it past myself
And everything else, a storm is approaching...
And it's beckoning my roots
Pulling them forth, stretching them beyond what I'd deemed physically possible
I am finding strength in places I thought I'd never know
Length in places I thought I'd never grow
Reminding myself to never be hindered or rendered worthless
By the evils of this Earth, or
The rain or the pain or all of the hurt
I have a heart like a hill
Lungs like gills and I, breathe underwater
A body like motion, a soul like the ocean
My mind is like Teflon..My heart is too tall
I'm more than the cloth from which I was torn, I
Live above it all. Rise Above The Storm
