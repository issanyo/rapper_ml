[Intro: Random people chatting]
Move out the way
Angel Haze is coming through
I heard Angel Haze grew up in the pot hole (Aw look at that bitch)
I heard she was fucking Chrishell Stubbs
Then started fucking Gambino (That's just like her anyway)
I heard the bitch deep throated two lizards and an anaconda

[Verse 1:]
Look, ride with my new bitch
But I’m on my old shit
Yeah I hold the power, ho, that remote control shit
Fucking bandwagon, that them bitches jumping on it
Bet I rap circles on them bitches like an orbit
Bet I rap circles till they dizzy like a full twist
Bet I kill bitches till I’m digging up they mortgage
Yo till I’m digging up they mortgage

And throw their bodies down like a preacher in a ball pit
Yo I’m nasty though, maybe we can record it like Casio
Maybe you can bite this, like Dracula
And put the head in when I fucking back it up
Nah I’m brash as fuck, get it wetter than a motherfucking aqueduct
Get it wetter than a motherfucking bath of ducks
Hand run it, so you bitches can’t pass it up
Like

[Verse 2]
Yo, what the fuck these bitches wanna know about me?
There ain’t one thing on earth I ain’t told about me
Just a month ago I was a no-uh-body
Now everybody wanna fucking know about me, huh?
Bitch best respect my space, stepping on your face
Like you detect my weight
Bitch I’m the best I see, blowing like the motherfucking next Ali
Yo there’s a man down and I’m chillin with a motherfucking bad brown
And another bad chick that sand toned, when her face painted on
Like Van Gogh
Yo y’all motherfuckers know I’m nasty, catch
Whatever motherfuckers throwing at me, gimme
Like motherfucker throw, I’m Cassie
And I better send them bitches going home happy

[Verse 3]
Look, once upon a time in Detroit
There was a little bitch born with a sweet voice
Saying all she ever wanted was to sing a song
And have a crowd full of people that sing along
But nobody gave a fuck that this was all off the top like a game of duck
Duck, duck, duck, duck, goose
Bitch my flow wild, like it’s been cut loose
And I’m running every lane like a wild car
And I still kill bitches when I stubborn
Yo it wasn’t never really easy though
But I never let them think that they could see me though
‘Cause I was alone at the bottom
Kept getting played like Hilary Rhoda
Now I’m up top and I’m coming for you losers
Bitches said it couldn’t happen but I’m living fucking proof bitches
So now all that’s left is to shine on ‘em
Whip it out and wet that shit from my behind and on ‘em
Y’all niggas thought you would see my grind over
But I’mma do this every motherfucking time on you
Yo I ain’t even break a sweat
Making your fucking head spin
Till you break your neck
I’m playing armadillo to a straight respect
I’m putting heat to you bitches like vapor necks
Yo look, I’m up, up and away
Smacking any bitch who got something to say
I don’t give a fuck, bitch is nothing to me
I wish a bitch would get tree stumped in the face
Yo tree stumped in the face, wait tree stumped in the face
I don’t give a fuck, bitch is nothing to me
I wish a bitch would get tree stumped in the face

[Outro:]
I mean I already know there a lot of these bitches are mad anyway
I mean, like, like I said I mean I feel like cause I'm stylin' on 'em
Bitches out here shaped like caravans
Bitches out here looking like wet noodles in the face
Bitches out here looking like mother fucking planet Jupiter
Bitches out here with edges looking like skid marks
Like, I just, I just, I know its cause I do the god damn thing on 'em
You know?
So its like I'm over here looking like a bag of money
And you over here looking like a bag of ventriloquist dummies
Like, I'm just trying to say it, like I'm the best bitch doing it
I don't gave a fuck yo
I never gave a fuck yo
