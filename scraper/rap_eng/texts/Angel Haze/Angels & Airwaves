[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
If youâ€™re contemplating suicide, this is for you
See this is for the moments when ya alone and with emotion
So fucking bold leaves you mentally frozen
When ya cold and alone heart open and broken
When that loves outta sight and your hearts into focus
When ya floating in oceans hopeless soaking in misery
Headphones on you link yourself with the synergy
When you watch your mind and ya lost in a song, be strong
You are not alone, I just want you to know you are not alone

[Hook]
There's angels in the airwaves tonight
And I've been running all of my life
And I need you to stay, I need you to stay
Angels in the airwaves tonight

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
This for all the moments when your weakness is your cloak
And people you love most just beat you to a pulp
When you cut open your wrist looking for loving in the slits
But find nothing but self hate cause nothing exists
See this for all the moments when they don't understand
And they ain't where you stand
And they can't comprehend
They just staring from the outside
And then they judging your in, when they
Kick you and beat you and hurt you then leave you
Laying on the ground like you half of they equal
Gladly defeat you then laugh to your face
When you feel all alone, when ya so outta place
They can't relate to this pain
They don't feel how I feel

[Bridge: Angel Haze]
So don't get lost tonight
Never let the ignorance cost ya life
You can make it, keep ya fingers crossed tonight
Put your headphones on and turn off the lights

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Angel Haze]
When the girl that you love won't look in your direction
When the guy you like adds you to his fucking collection
When you all dressed in black
And they whisper and snicker
And they make you feel wrong for being so different
This for everybody who knows what it is
To feel like nothing but a memory that won't be relived
That distant fucking shit that everyone forgets
The words on the tip of tongues that gets swallowed with the spit
See I know how it feels
I've been there before
I had head in my hands and my heart on the floor
I've been worthless and shattered
I've been nothing to people
I know what it is to have to force them to see you

[Bridge 1: Angel Haze]

[Bridge 2}
I've been running now
I'm outta here today
I've been running now
Questioning my faith (x2)
There's angels in the...

[Verse 4: Angel Haze]
For when you feel so invisible you're not even sure you exist
So you cut yourself open just to see if you real
You numb yourself with drugs just to hide what you feel
You drink the washed up pain in hopes of rejecting it afterwards
You live everyday wishing you could rewind your life backwards
Because you wanna figure out where the fuck you went wrong
Cause everything in your world ain't been right for so long
I know how it feels
So this is for you
If you're thinking it now
If you're wanting to die
If you're thinking it out
You are so much more than you are in this moment
You never know how great you can be
Don't give up on you
I didn't give up on me
