Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Woo!

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
I know all I do is shit talk
But honestly I’m pissed off!
I’ve been like the fucking realest since I kicked up
Catch me chilling with a model and the strip star
If you know me then you know that my shit raw
Spit hard, nigga, actually I spit bars
Jump on the wagon, show me love, show me fucking love
While the rest of the world getting pissed off
Get flipped off, I’m just here doing what I meant for
Talk shit, I snap you get sent for
I might be cordial, you might smile at you fuckboys
But none of you niggas exempt tho
Picture me giving a shit, tho
That’s like two shots of the tempo
I’m killing myself and like everyone else
Do I got competition? shit, no!
All of you bitches are weak clones
I know the game, I got chicos
My dude a pro shooter, my bitch work at Hooters
They worship the ground that my feet on!
Murdered you niggas on your song
If you said that I couldn’t, then you’re wrong
Stick to your pace, and you came back an ace
And did that shit all within four songs
Bitch!

[Hook: Angel Haze]
Shabba Rank, bitch, sha
Shabba Rank, bitch!
Gimme Bank Bitch
Trap Lord, shit!
Trap Lord, bitch, yeah!

Aoooouuh!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
I am far too immaculate
To not jump on the track and spazz the bitch
To not walk in the club and smack a bitch
To not throw a bad bitch where the mattress is
Yo, Angel Haze!
Bars for days
Ah wait, hold on! Replay!
Angel Haze, bars for days
Shots like a motherfucker campus range
At BCU never Junior Tech
And I keep the automatic on a dashboard deck
I'm on set with my chick that sails
You are on that money train that has been derailed
Fuck!
Yo, I feel sorry for the runner up
Cause I forever spit cold, better bundle up
I got an ill nigga, he got a nice flow
I just get the brain, like a micro
Sick flow but I think it’s psycho
Dash face bitches like a typo
That’s reality like a live show
You’re in my lair, you gotta get the right tone
I’m shooting with the camera
I hope I got you with the right pose
