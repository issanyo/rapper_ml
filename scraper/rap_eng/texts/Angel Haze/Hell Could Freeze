Hell could freeze over now
You want peace, hear me shout
Hell could freeze (hell could freeze) over now (over now)
You want peace (you want peace), hear me shout (hear me shout)

Uh, I wrote this to tell you how much I’m missing you
And how ironically I’m feeling crazy as an institute
I’m contemplating times you told me that I would be without you
Had an exit strategy and you were trying to see me out
We were like a part that be in me at the mood swings
Couldn’t get it off the ground like bruised wings
Not one, not two, but a few things
Made me question what it really was you bring
Now that the madness over and the fog’s been clear and I’m sadly sober
I could see the brakes fail and the crash before us
And the heavens poured down like your last proposal
Like uh, give me one more chance
Last one, just one more dance
No future, just a past before us
And that'll rerun 'til we cast the show

Cause I, I don’t wanna be playing games with you
Not with you, not with you (we go, we go up and down)
Hell could freeze over now (turn me inside out)
You want peace (you make my heart do flips), hear me shout
('til I forget about)

Ah, cupid’s gun to our souls, he just can’t trigger chemistry
I need a lot of things that you can’t really give to me
I’m screaming on mute cause you ain’t really hearing me
The hardest fucking love is where you make your biggest enemy
Flash..back to a year ago
Hand in hand, in the tragic fear it would go
I don’t understand
How’d it happen, where did it go?
All the love and the passion, once here, is ghost
Uh, it’s gone now
And I’m here, and I’m there, and I’m torn now
And I’m hurt and I’m bruised, and I’m torn down
And I've made some mistakes, but matured now
And I’ve touched my regrets through my pause now
And felt how it feels to be sure now
And I know what it means to deplore now
And I know what it means to endure trials
And I know when it hurts to the core now
And I’ve burnt every bridge that I’ve torn down
And I've picked up your heart from the floor now
And I want and I'm cravin' you more now
So just give me one more chance
Last one, just one more dance
I know we go back and forth
But my back’s to the wall and I’m back for more like

I don’t wanna be playing games with you
Not with you, not with you (we go, we go up and down)
Hell could freeze over now (turn me inside out) (you make my heart do flips)
You want peace ('til I forget about), hear me shout
This ride, this ride

You make my heart, yeah, yeah
I don’t understand, where did it go
And I’m here, and I’m there
Where did it go
Cause we go up and down
Cause we go up and down
Cause we go up and down

[Inaudible]

Cause we go up and down (hell could freeze over)
Turn me inside out (over now)
You make my heart do flips (you want peace)
'Til I forget (hear me shout)

Cause we go up (we go, we go up and down)
Hell could freeze over now (turn me inside out)
You want peace, hear me shout (you make my heart do flips)
You make my heart, you make my
