[Verse 1]
The forest rain
The jungle lane
Our voices touched
But our hearts weren't there
A silent game
A eulogy
Time would bring the ruining

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart's a soaring kite, in your sky
The wind's getting too strong
Thought it was do or die, fail or fly
Can't wait on me too long
You got your pretty life
I know I'll always be haunting you
Baby, I can't hide from the truth
Always be wanting you

[Chorus]
My heart strings are broken
My lungs can't stop smoking
For you, you
For you, you
Oh fly, baby, go where the forecast says
No Raeen
For you, you
For you, you

[Post-Chorus]
Feel it, I know you do
Feel it, I know you do
Feel I, I belong with you
Feel it

[Verse 2]
Our carcasses
Are travelled bones
We've run ourselves
So far from home
Stole my faith
I spared your soul
Tainted hands, lost control

[Bridge]
I guess we'll always have Sweden
Love stays alive in our gardens of eden
Someone to love is someone for the season
Don't bite the apple, the odds dont go even

[Chorus]
My heart strings are broken
My lungs can't stop smoking
For you, you
For you, you
Oh fly, baby, go where the forecast says
No Raeen
For you, you
For you, you

[Post-Chorus]
Feel it, I know you do
Feel it, I know you do
Feel I, I belong with you
Feel it

[Bridge]
Where you at, where you at
Where your heart strings at
If you're lost, you can scream
Let my heart scream back
I got lost in the trees
But my heart swings back
Heart swings back

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart's a soaring kite, in your sky
The wind's getting too strong
Thought it was do or die, fail or fly
Can't wait on me too long
You got your pretty life
I know I'll always be haunting you
Baby, I can't hide from the truth
Always be wanting you

[Chorus]
My heart strings are broken
My lungs can't stop smoking
For you, you
For you, you
Oh fly, baby, go where the forecast says
No Raeen
For you, you
For you, you

[Outro]
Just an abandoned wolf all alone in the woods
Heartbroken into the shape of the moon
Howl at myself, howl at myself, howl at myself
Just an abandoned wolf all alone in the woods
Heartbroken into the shape of the moon
Howl at myself, howl at myself, die to be felt
