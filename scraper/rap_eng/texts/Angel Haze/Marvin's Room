[Intro]
— Hello
— Hello

— Hey
— Hi
— Are you busy right now?
— No, i have a stack
— Is she around?
— Yeah
— Hey i don't know why i called so late but i just... i just have to let you know

[Verse 1]
My heart just broke
I thought I woulda sex to you
I see you in my bedroom
I wish you were who I'm next to
Got pictures in my old phone
I still see your face there
You got broken heart too
Then how can we bare?

[Hook]
Fuck the new girl that you think you found
I know you're with her because I'm not around
I said, fuck that new girl that you adore
You and her are nothing like we were before

(Stop scream)

I'm just saying, you can do better
You did that the day when you met me
I'm just saying, you can do better
Don't confuse my care for hatin'

[Verse 2]
You know it doesn't feel right
I know because I know you
I know you know what love is
Cause I took the time to show you
Givin' her all your lovin'
Makin' something of nothing
I know you hate it when I say it
But I'm say it anyway

[Hook]
Fuck the new girl that you think you found
I know you're with her because I'm not around
I said, fuck that new girl that you adore
You and her are nothing like we were before

(Stop scream)

I'm just saying, you can do better
You did that the day when you met me
I'm just saying, you can do better
Don't confuse my care for hatin'

[Verse 3]
Uhm, look
I tried to resist all of the urges
Kept thinking what is the purpose
If it's (all gone now)
See, we were almost perfect, well, perfect until we weren't but this (almost counts)
(Now we know it doesn't)
I'm always working, I'm barely hurt
But, seems at any moment that hurt might surface
And if I think about you, that just might worsen
And I can't control what I do when this urges
I need you right now
Are you down?
And listen to me
Boy, since you left, I've been feeling empty
You got my heart, can you give it to me?
Know it's got stuck and I have yours to keep
Outside of us, I've got no one to blame
All of that love wasn't as strong as we've planned
All of our problems gon' stay the same
I was so stupid to think that could change
Sorry for the switch-up, I'm just having problem
I just wanna fix that, I'll be doing good
I promise this is a hiccup
Got it off my chest
I'm just happy that you picked up
(Oh shit, how about he not just...)

[Hook]
I'm just saying, you can do better
You did that the day when you met me
I'm just saying, you can do better
Don't confuse my care for hatin'

[Outro]
Mom, I'm listening my memories reliving you
Do you hate me, are your feelings residual?
