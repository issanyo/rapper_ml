[Intro]
You said, you said: "We could dance forever"
You said: "Two hearts in the wild could bloom together"
I remember, I remember

[Verse 1]
Being with the flowers, baby
Running 'round in spring with you
Dancing on your pedestal
Praying to your crescent moon
I remember, I remember, I remember
We were gods before this
We were made from the heat of the stars
I reached for a love tucked too deep in your heart
I held u up to where birds never fly
You held me tight in the frame of your mind
I would suffer the nature of rain for you, baby
This is nothing to hide
I was just born with nothing that was mine
You was raised up with no one on your side
See, all I am is fossiled youth
In ways I want for you
Baby, if my memories didn't make me bleed
I would leave the wild for you

[Chorus]
All our heartache we consume
In our young years, oh we're doomed, yeah
But I'm in a different love, I think I'd die for you
(Yeah, yeah)
Open up the sky, I'd make it cry for you
(Yeah, yeah)
Oh it feels like Eros in the spring, don't it?
(Yeah, yeah)
I remember all the pretty things, don't I?

[Verse 2]
Being in the forest, baby
Covered by the jumper's nooses
Praying that the trees weren't dead
Finding you with all those bruises
I remember I tried to revive you, remember?
But you were gone for good
You were dancing with demons and smothered in youth
Couldn't be more undeserving of you
Couldn't be more unprepared for the truth, oh yeah
I was battling secrets, obsessed with the dead
Painted the blue that was left of me red
Burying skulls in the back of my head, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
If all our love's now memories
Then was it meant to be
Baby, if it leaves our hearts so instantly
Then was it make believe, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, I hurt all over, it's the worst baby
Thinking 'bout the magic in your skirt, baby
Sorry, you bruised your knees, yeah
Running wild in the trees, yeah
Will you remember me, yeah

[Chorus]
All our heartache we consume
In our young years, oh we're doomed, yeah
But I'm in a different love, I think I'd die for you
(Yeah, yeah)
Open up the sky, I'd make it cry for you
(Yeah, yeah)
Oh it feels like Eros in the spring, don't it?
(Yeah, yeah)
I remember all the pretty things, don't I?

[Outro]
Being in the desert, baby
Talking 'bout your energy
Trying to teach you all the shields
To save you from you enemies
Remember, don't you remember?
Don't you
Don't you
Don't you
Don't you
Oooh
