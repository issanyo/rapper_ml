Tha Cartel

How arrogant
The cartel

Most of y'all ignorant inches
On my bar scale

"Dope sounds" how does being a narc feel ?

I'm the best all around hands down cartwheel

Mmmmrrr Ferris wheel
Still in appeal

In the blues which is kinda navy
Riddim it
Reseal

I'm the villain
Do it again now it's revealed

While you doubt
I self encourage

That guy cold
Reinsurance

Reassurance
Of the
Endurance

It just takes some courage

But y'all cowardly

Stay peeking out the window hourly

You better think smart
Howardly

Turn these rugrats to mugrats
But that's child a B

Flame at flame but that's wild of me

Put jack in a box like I'm Trynna eat

And jack his pot like the lottery

And that's a lot of cheese

So yo girl I burger check mate
Now you see ?

That's a Burger King if yo rappers don't stop Robbin me

ðŸŽ£

Playing on these tracks cause everybody else scared to get hit by that train

But I got tracks and tracks and tracks that's how I train

While you sit over there and write
Shh I do it myself it'll take half time

That's phat fat
Skreech I always rhyme

Mad cause these weak niggas get on all the time

And even though I did it first I don't get no shine

Tha cartel here to remind

If you need good bars their in supply

But you should go for the bullets
Just suggested high

Not promoting violence

I just got an army mind

Militia always staying on my side

Like a RPG between yo teeth
Were guaranteed
To blow your mind

If I'm not the zoo keeper with Rosario Dawson bars
Fine

Lion out your teeth
That's a den of lies

So you come to me on the day of my daughters wedding
Get out my site

Askin for favors I'm like

ðŸŽ£

Undertaker bell rings

When MCs turn to R&B

R&B turn to MCs

U was done at the beginning
ABC

Broadcasting cross America
ABC

Stretch that
Across earth

Turn any universe
To a university

Killed it before
So this class can get rehearsed

Pursue things then stop and hang around your just a purse

Realest nigga in the game yeah that'll be a first

You the type to be
Drank smoke
That's a verse

All these rappers is friends
They don't wanna get hurt

Get the fuck outta here
Like a magic skirt

Leave the gun take the cannoli
Still eat after the murk

Wit Yo soda can flows
I had to burp

Uuuuhhhhh Y you think they come to tha cartel first ?
