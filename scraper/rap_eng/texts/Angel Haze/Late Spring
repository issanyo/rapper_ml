[Verse 1]
When late spring came, I fell in love, yeah
A lonely crystal angel reaching out for me
Is what he was, yeah
And now I'm yours to keep, I got it all for you
I'll rock your baby's breath to sleep
I'll rub your orchids too

[Chorus]
Baby, we're hiding in the trees, hiding in the trees
Come climb on top of me, come climb on top of me
Petals on your knees, petals on your knees
You're my spring
You look better in the sunrise
You look better when the moon shines
Hold me down in the sunrise
Hold me down when the moon shines

[Verse 2]
And now, I'm on a roll
I got rose petals stuck between my toes
And I, I only feel the way I feel
When I'm with you, when I'm with you

[Chorus]
Baby, we're hiding in the tree, hiding in the tree
Come climb on top of me, come climb on top of me
Petals on your knees, petals on your knees
You're my spring
You look better in the sunrise
You look better when the moon shines
Hold me down in the sunrise
Hold me down when the moon shines

[Bridge]
And now we're making love
Rolling round on top of me
Oh my god, plant your seed and flowers bloom
Making love, rolling round on top of me
Oh my god, plant your seed and flowers bloom

[Chorus]
Baby, we're hiding in the tree, hiding in the tree
Come climb on top of me, come climb on top of me
Petals on your knees, petals on your knees
You're my spring
You look better in the sunrise
You look better when the moon shines
Hold me down in the sunrise
Hold me down when the moon shines
