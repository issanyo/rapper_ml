[Verse 1: Kwamie Liv]
I see you clear as yesterday
Top down, fingers in the breeze
Weavin' through the lights in the sky
You said, "Baby, close your eyes"
And I prayed we would always
Hold on to this feeling, stronger, faster
Faster

And now you're on your knees on the highway
Talking 'bout, "Wish we would done shit my way"
There's so many things, I might have done
And all these bodies tryna' hold me
But they don't know me like you know me, Cha Cha

[Pre-Chorus: Kwamie Liv]
And I remember you
And the flowers in your hair
How I promised you I always will have your back
But can you love me despite the cracks?
Can you love me?
Can you love me despite the cracks?

[Hook: Kwamie Liv]
Oh-oh baby, this pleasure, this pain
Oh-oh baby, this pleasure, this pain
Pleasure this pain, pleasure this pain, baby
Oh-oh baby, this pleasure, this pain
Oh-oh baby, this pleasure, this pain
Pleasure this pain, pleasure this pain, baby

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
My memories ain't the best, you know
I don't like feelin' the rest of them
If you and me were meant to meet the sky together
Then I can be the wind beneath you, fly forever
Careful baby what you ask for
I got fire tucked inside me like a matchbox
You know I was doo-oomed, to fall in love with you
Put a band-aid on, and move forward for the time being
But I can't tell if that's my heart beatin' or if that's time leaving
See I been talking to you lately, feels like I been going crazy
Tryna' forge a hole in time and erase all those painful places
I was only stickin' to the script, doll, you wrote
I was only givin' what I get, doll, you know
Cause I can paint a picture in the sky right where you wanna be
I never said it, love, but more like you is what I wanna be

[Hook: Kwamie Liv]
Oh-oh baby, this pleasure, this pain
Oh-oh baby, this pleasure, this pain
Pleasure this pain, pleasure this pain
Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it burns
Oh-oh baby, this pleasure, this pain
Oh-oh baby, this pleasure, this pain
Pleasure this pain, pleasure this pain
[?] bye to you
To you

Can you love me? Can you love me despite the cracks?
Can you love me? Can you love me despite the cracks?
