[Verse 1: Mary Lambert]
Living in the darkness
I wear it like a crown
Oh I've got tough skin
Ready for for my bow
All I've got is two hands
I tied them in the middle
Ready for the red tape
To open up my ribcage

[Pre-Chorus: Mary Lambert]
I offer souvenirs
A deaf tongue and blinded ears
Can you fill the shelves in here?
Come in come in

[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
Everybody look around
Everybody look around
I don't know how to fill the space
The invitation's on the page
Open up my ribcage

[Verse 2: K Flay]
Want you to want me like I'm all you got
Know that you see it but can't make me stop
Telling the truth it might mean you get broken
But letting it hurt that's my method of coping
Doubt in season like that smoke in my lungs
What they project on me what I've become
Down on my knees unsure what to say
No I never learned how to prey
Don't know know who I been fooling
But you got me running in circles I'm ruined
Let you inside opened up all my wounds
Taking my ribcage and ripped it in two

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mary Lambert]
Tie off all my tendons
Watch how they stretch
Oh I've got the muscle
But lord, I'm spent
Knocking down my sternum
Began at a young age
Too much space between
Open up my ribcage

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Verse 4: Angel Haze]
There's impenetrable silence inside of my head
There's nothing I can vibe with, I'm practically dead
I get so tired of writing everything I should have said
That maybe this time I'll put my pen down and just tell you instead
You see I opened up my ribcage and violence flew out
The organs softly played through my violin mouth
I got lifetimes worth of love hidden beneath my tongue
Written on my skin, tells me your the one


[Chorus]
