[Hook: Angel Haze]
Your skin sounds like my favorite vinyl
You got broken records trapped inside you
You know I searched this galaxy to find you
We're in love, we're at war
Play my song, turn it up, turn it up

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
Yo
You remind me of a song that I can't seem to skip
Your skin's the record and the needle is my fingertips
Recollection, I touch you and I get a glimpse
Of all the same old songs and repeated skits
Look, I know that love is always bound to change
But I promise that my records never sound the same
And I show you how it changes when you sculpt it
Show you music, but like way more culture
There's a world and I can't wait to expose you
I play you out until everybody knows you
Till you up, fix the flaws like Melodyne
But you're forever, now you're music that'll never die
Yo, it's timeless
I hear inflections of forever in your high pitch
Put my face to your chest, hear the bass in your breath
And baby my whole mind shifts

[Hook: Angel Haze]
Your skin sounds like my favorite vinyl
You got broken records trapped inside you
You know I searched this galaxy to find you
We're in love, we're at war
Play my song, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up (6x)

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
You are the songs that I write to my wrongs
The calm inside of the rioting storm
Stand here, in the center of divinity
While I rehearse the role of forever, infinity
Action - I begin to relish in the moment
Discarding my reality, imagining components
Fracturing mentalities, I'm casualty spoken
If warning comes before destruction, you're the omen
Yo, and I'm just judging by the sight of you
I climb your mental mountains til I reach the very height of you
Visually perceptive, in you I see the most
I wrote this when I'm spacing, I'm tryna keep us close
This my deeper part, this my weaker part
Emotions on blast, turned up my speaker hard
I can find you, you everything right here now
Turned around, rewound, I can hear you clear now

[Brige: Angel Haze]
There are so many words, but none explain my love
No no no no no no no no
Where the love is lost, but so much to gain my love
We are houses built on top of pain, my love
My love, my love
We are gardens filled with sounds of grey, my love
And now [?] you're someplace, the words say...

[Hook: Angel Haze]
