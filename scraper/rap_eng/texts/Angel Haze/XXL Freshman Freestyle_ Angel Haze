[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
Yo, I'm abuse to these bitches
They endure domestic violence
Flowin' loud like the roar out the mouth of a lion
All these hoes get delete, even when I ain't watchin'
Puttin' all ya'll careers in a custom made coffin
Yes, I'm a problem
Fuck the confusion
Success is like a lonely ass road to seclusion
Me, I'm prepared for it
I know I'mma tear thru' it
I'm about to blow up like balloons with some air thru' it
Tell them what I don't give, 10 fucks
Dead skin and they bout to get nip/tuck
Mines like a bullet, I kill you if I shoot it
Perfected my craft
The best go, cool whip
Fuck this game while I'm cummin' in it raw shit
Overlapping bitches who runnin' it like they jogging
Ready or Not
Im comin for you bastards
Whippin' nigga's asses they finna call me "Massa"
Yo, My flow so massive
Fuck out of my space ho, NASA
Point is that I'm on point and the pointed to flex on you bitches like I'm fucking double-jointed
Yo, Ya'll all over
On top of my green like lawnmowers
Shit, I am ahead
Ya'll all shoulders
Get the fuck off my clit
Ya'll wallholders
