Phat Fat verse:

Pokemon

Catch em with the right pose

Like I got the gun

Say cheese

Gonzales
Y'all must be on speed

On the lay
On the lay
Lay up eas

Track to dentist
Talk slick out the teeth

That's a race track

Got 5 on my mind

Wave cap

Give her that bat man
If she can cave that

She Trynna link up
Mii na slave that

Hold on

5 star wanted level
Soldiers on

Trynna get china old
With Alaska young

Sick wen I jump out
Jordan tounges

Crissant I see bread

Ball like a I and all I see is u dead

Gotta lose like a medusa head

They always ask who the f b I
Like I'm the Feds

Sci fy
How they identify I

Rang Flamang
That's all mines

You ain't fly u just sky dive

Call that 9 11 more times

Tell angel haze ill fuck her for some curly fries

Did I say that
She'll probably motha fuckin embarrass me

-
She 313 all day

Me 323 all day

My stripes got me my rank

Me and mrs haze

Been overdue
Since MySpace days

But that's another case

Dancing halls like shabba ranks

Work it out like billy blanks

Use ur brain tank
Before soldiers bring ur brain a tank

Now drown in that

Militia

We bout that
No

We bout bout that

Cookin raw
Please don't over season

Every dog has its day and every bitch has her season

Hoo
