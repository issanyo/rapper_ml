[Intro]
I won't grow up, I wanna have fun
I just wanna be wild and young
I might say you're my number one
I just wanna be wild and young

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
Get down, like the type of chick that you wish I was right now
But I know, that haste ain't never gonna get you love and now
It's so, premature and conditional that
If I let you drown off in my wishing well
You might wish you won't
But why can't we both just chill why is shit so real when I said I'm only down for the night
Bitch I'm all about my bread but I never been a bird
I ain't never been to flock or flight
Baby we can do it in the dark or light
Get elevated get lost in the height
If I let you taste my flame
Then shit that'd probably be the spark of your life

[Hook]
I own it, I own it
Content with, my wrongness
Heart-breaker, heart-taker
Content with, my wrongness
I own it, I own it
I fucking, condone it
Heart-breaker, heart-taker
Content with, my wrongness
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
Live by the words of a wise man
Who said don't go falling in love
So as much as I can, I, steer clear of all that stuff
I fear that I am, a little less emotional
Took a couple fuck it pills, I think that I overdosed
Gotta darkside to me, you could call it comatose
Everybody's quick to talk about some shit that they don't know
Fuck what you heard, like I'm fuckin' what you heard
Like the words to my (uhh!) and I'm fuckin' every word
Fuckin' every verb, do something for me now
Play dirty like shoes on the muddy ground
I'm too smart with it, dudes try to dumb me down
But they get played like blues in the fucking south
I get you open then choose when to shut you out
Walk up in it like guess who's in the fucking house?

[Hook]
I own it, I own it
Content with, my wrongness
Heart-breaker, heart-taker
Content with, my wrongness
I own it, I own it
I fucking, condone it
Heart-breaker, heart-taker
Content with, my wrongness
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it
I own it, I own it

I won't grow up, I wanna have fun
I just wanna be wild and young
I might say you're my number one
I just wanna be wild and young

I'm pulling up tonight, give me what you got
You're looking good, when I'm taking these shots
I won't grow up, I wanna have fun

I just wanna be wild and, wild and young
