I'm taking something real real real good
Doing something bad to it
Listening to my own music
Dropping something fast to it
I know that these haters listen
This shit is their [?] fluid
Drink up, swallow, suck my dick
And don't you gag to it
I be on that other shit
They be on my fucking clit
I bet I take that ball
Take that shot and never fucking miss
Yes, I am the best
Yes, I know and yes I rub it in
I'm ready for my deal but
First give me my publishing
Who you know did it
In a year no discovery
Left the track in critical condition
No recovery
Who you know, nineteen
Running with a better rep
Walking through the clouds
And I ain't even been to heaven yet
Damn it, I'm good
I ain't finished getting better yet
When I'm gon' stop, huh?
Never was a better guess
I mean I'm better left
I mean I'm better right
I say I'm fucking [?]
That means I'm outta sight
I mean I'm getting in
And you just get in line
You say I ain't the best?
You must be out your mind
Don't even waste your time
Coming for my throne, ho
Always stepping on what's mine, and
I ain't even blown, ho
Mind state ill, unh
Psychiatric zone, ho
Couldn't get ahead of me
If you had a fucking clone, ho
Filthy mouth bastard
Dirty mind asshole
Headed for the top
Even running through the cash flow
Still getting better, huh
Why the fuck you still amazed?
Said "fuck friends"
Since then I haven't been betrayed
I write the fucking book
And still got the time to illustrate
Best rookie in the game
Word to mister Dennis Quaid
How could it get better? Huh?
Someone gotta let me know
Let me fucking spit
And watch the world all make the letter OHHHH
Yeah bitch, Angel Haze
I'm for real fly
Never fuck with Ken dolls
Catch me with a real guy
Jab at who I want to
Take a stab at who I want to
It's the metaphor olympics
Run a lap round who I want to
Bitch I'm [?]
Way nastier than you
They like
"Angel, you're a fucking disaster in the booth"
I spit facts and I spit truth
Don't hold gats but I let loose
I'm so fucking close to god
I could send a rapture after you
In the game is bein [?]
So I could [?]
It's a picture perfect life
And I'mma capture it with you
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Listen to me please
You may have money
You may have power
But you ain't got shit
If you ain't got peace
A door ain't shit if you can not leave
And a car ain't shit if you ain't got keys
And a game ain't shit, said it ain't shit
No, it ain't shit if it ain't got me
Let me fall back and, um
Let me recline
I just said damn near everything
That was on my mind
I lose control sometimes
But I will not stop and I won't behave
How the fuck can you be free
When your mind is still enslaved, bitch?
