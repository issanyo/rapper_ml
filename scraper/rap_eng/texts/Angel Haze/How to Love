See they say 'til you define it you won't know it when you find it
Cause you struggle to move forward but your past is stuck behind you
How to love, hey, hey, how to love

And they say even with a mirror, you can't see it any clearer
Pay attention to your ear cause that's the closest they appear
How to love, hey, hey, how to love

But you don't get so many chances
One question with too many different answers
One stage with too many different actors
One forward, it's 20 steps backwards

See you had a lotta people try to tell you what it was
But even the perfect words couldn't tell you what it is to love
Ay, how to love

And you had a lotta people try to paint the perfect picture
But through all that repetition couldn't tell you when it is my love
It's not love

So now you lost up in the world with your mind frame backwards
Running so much you've forgotten what you after
Hey, now the joke's on you
Cause "you in power", they told you

[DaKIDAnt:]
So I take a taxi to a girl I used to see
Told her that I'm moving so we probably couldn't be
Probably cause it wasn't like I'm moving overseas
But to take a plane to NY everyday, that costs a fee
She like "Why would you? How could you?"
I just told her that I'm pursuing my dreams
Besides, I'll be back for you, sing a rap for you
I'm outta this world, lemme draw a map for you
I had to stand on my own, got no back issues
But when you all on your own, that's when your past hits you
True love is hard to come by
I stole you heart- is that a love crime?
Yeah? Well if so, you should sentence me
25 to life, all alone, with no memory
So I can't remember you, you would remember me
But not as a love, more like I'm an enemy
There's no "love bug", she won't get a love bite
Niggas did it wrong, now she wouldn't love right
Yeah, it's young Ant, no Bug's Life
I'm about to blast off, no Buzz Light

[Angel Haze:]
You had a lotta people try to tell you what it was
But even the perfect words couldn't tell you what it is to love
Ay, how to love
And you had a lotta people try to paint the perfect picture
But with all that repetition couldn't tell you when it is my love
Ay, it's not love

And you had a lotta people try to steal your heart
Had a lotta people try to feel your spark
Had a dead end try to be your start
Had a lotta people try to play that part

See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
But when you at the bottom, and things can only get better
My love, ay, my love

And you had a lotta people try to tell you different things
Don't know it when you feel it, you gonna know it when you see
My love, ay, ay, my love

And you had a lot of people try to tell you was it was
But even the perfect words couldn't tell you how it feels to love
Ay, how to love

And you had a lotta people try to keep it like a secret
So I love you when you mean it, not only when it's convenient
My love
Cause you my love, yeah
