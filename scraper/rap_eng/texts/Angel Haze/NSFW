[Verse 1: Cal Shapiro]
She get broke necks, people staring back
Lookin' like an angel, but she wearing black
Hop up in the range, girl, I'm feeling that
Make that mini skirt do a disappearing act
I'm Houdini with the lingerie, oh
Specialize in hoes gettin' outta they clothes
Do it in the mirror working on a new pose
She gon' press that ass out while she standin' on her tippy toes
T-t-tippy toes, I'm just strippin' hoes
She can shimmy those, l-l-love it when you give me those
Puttin' on a show, you know that I'm feelin' those pictures
Drop it low and send a couple videos
Not loyal, no, I never ever trust
But they sendin' pics, probably makin' Helen Keller blush
I think I'm more famous than I'm letting on
Cause these hoes gettin' off 'fore they even gettin' on

[Chorus: Cal Shapiro]
Ay, now, I may be turnt
Put a few down and a couple of Percs (couple of Percs)
Faded right now, club so loud
Take your phone out, send me something not safe for work
Not safe for work, (not safe for work) not safe for work (not safe for work)
Girl, take your phone out, send me something not safe for work

[Verse 2: Cal Shapiro]
I got a bad phone for them bad hoes in the background
Seeing me chillin' in a bath robe gettin' back rubs in the spa
Everything I ask for
From what I've seen, I'm not even sure she has clothes
Right on, told her to chive on
Ass from America, phone from Taiwan
Ripping nylon on that itty bitty thong
That body so electric, told her to slide on

[Chorus: Cal Shapiro]
Ay, now, I may be turnt
[Put a few down and a couple of Percs (couple of Percs)
Faded right now, club so loud
Take your phone out, send me something not safe for work
Not safe for work, (not safe for work) not safe for work (not safe for work)
Girl, take your phone out, send me something not safe for work

Angel Haze: Hey. Uh, uh

[Bridge: Angel Haze]
No one is boring, that ain't my thing
Go on and send me that P I C
The sun goes down and we get nasty
Always going down, always going wild
No one is boring, that ain't my thing
Go on and send me that P I C
The sun goes down and we get nasty
Always going down, always going wild

[Chorus: Cal Shapiro]
Ay, now, I may be turnt
[Put a few down and a couple of Percs (couple of Percs)
Faded right now, club so loud
Take your phone out, send me something not safe for work
Not safe for work, (not safe for work) not safe for work (not safe for work)
Girl, take your phone out, send me something not safe for work
Not safe for work, (not safe for work) not safe for work (not safe for work)
Girl, take your phone out, send me something not safe for work
Not safe for work, (not safe for work) not safe for work (not safe for work)
Girl, take your phone out, send me something not safe for work
