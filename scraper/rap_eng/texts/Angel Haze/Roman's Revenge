I am like magic
I am a classic
Putting heat to these bitches like I’m ironing fabric
Can’t satisfy the appetite of a savage
So I’m eating til’ I’m at the top
Open and passage, Open and passage, Oh it’s so drastic
Killing shit and have them bitches holding their casket
I am on point bitch I’m verbally cactus
And It's my turn now like a rotating axis
Tell em’ I don’t hold myself for no one
I’m a fucking asshole so forth so on
And I rap circles around bitches I got em’ running in relays
Have they jaw dropped in the same position for three days
I hear them hoes hating
I got a proposition
Until you come bold you ain’t no competition
I put bitches in a bag, V- Necks
Coming up like gag, reflex
These bitches on my sack deep dip
Give in I sneak previews, free clips
Y’all bitches don’t want the drama
I’ll end your sentence in like colon comma
Call me Mrs. Take the lead to these bitches
On tracks like glue to the weave of these bitches
I’ll take em’ all in like I’m breathing these bitches
And put a couple tricks up the sleeve of these bitches
If I don’t kill it best believe I’ll make you bleed and need stitches
Can’t believe that yall really be believing these bitches
Watch em’ all get signed like I’m breeding these bitches

Ha, Ha Y’all hoes is slacking
If I catch you slipping I'mma lunge and attack you
I'mma break your neck
I'mma rumble and drag you
I’m the queen of this shit and you approaching my castle
Rah, Rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah Rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah like a dungeon dragon like a dungeon dragon like a dungeon dragon

I’m more abusive to these bitches than doing domestic violence
Going hard like the roar out the mouth of a lion
All these hoes scared to leave even when I ain’t watching
Putting all yall careers into custom made coffins
Yes I’m a problem
Fuck that confusion
Success is like a lonely ass road of seclusion
Me I’m prepared for it
I know I'mma dare do it
I’m about to blow like balloon put some air through it
Tell em’ what I don’t give 10 fucks
Dead skin and they about to get nip tucked
Mind like a bullet I’ll kill you if I shoot it
Perfecting my craft, Nabisco cool whip
Fuck this game when I’m coming in it raw shit
Overlapping bitches, that’s running it like they jogging
Ready or not I’m coming for you bastards
Whipping niggas asses they finna call me massa
Uh My flow so massive
Fuck outta my space ho NASA
Point is that I’m on point and appointed
To flex on these bitches like I’m fucking double jointed
Th y’all all over
On top of that green like lawn mower
I am a head
Y’all all shoulders
Get the fuck off my clit y’all wall holders

Ha, Ha Y’all hoes is slacking
If I catch you slipping I'mma lunge and attack you
I'mma break your neck
I'mma rumble and drag you
I’m the queen of this shit and you approaching my castle
Rah, Rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah Rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah like a dungeon dragon like a dungeon dragon like a dungeon dragon
