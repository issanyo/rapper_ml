[Verse 1]
I've been ... of you and you face
And ... around, the shape of my fake
And I kiss you in silence
I don’t make a sound, and it I said, it I said, it’s going down
Taste you, tease you, lean in between us
Them purple kisses straight from your codeine cups
Inhale it like the air in between us
We up and down, and down we on that see-saw, ooh

[Hook]
Underneath the sky, baby come help me fly
Yeah underneath my skin begging me to let you, to let you, begging me to let you, to let you
Begging me to let you, to let you
Begging me to let you in

[Verse]

I live like Floetry and you're on top like you’re over see
And if I pull you down there'll be one last cloud that's over me
And um I know cuz I can taste the air that you smoke
And I get high even on my knees when I taste the ...
And I follow the trail of sadness to whereever is that you go
One more shot, you’re hit by amnesia, forget whatever is that you know
And you tell me not to worry cuz that passion makes me safe
Cuz it’s only one more cloud to heaven but we hit hell on our way
And I get to tell my fate, tell that tears have no no lies (???)
And you take me to that place were I can reveal what’s on my mind
And we both drawn our lines but heaven knows ... on a blue day ...
And I take you to my place and fuck you with my mind
So you got no perception of space
And no perception of time
And we can press rewind, and role play for that screenplay
And if you want that boulevard of broken dream then I got that green day like

[Hook]
Ooh
Underneath the sky, baby come help me fly
Yeah underneath my skin begging me to let you ,to let you, begging me to let you, to let you
Begging me to let you, to let you
Begging me to let you in

And here we sing and go again
Underneath the sky, baby here we go again, yeah, yeah
And here we sing and go again
Underneath the sky, baby here we go again
Baby come help me
Ooh

[Hook x2]
Underneath the sky, baby come help me fly
Yeah underneath this game begging me to let you, to let you, begging me to let you,to let you
Begging me to let you
To let you, begging me to let you in
