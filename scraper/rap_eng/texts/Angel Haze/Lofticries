My mind’s an art gallery
Carrots, lettuce, celery
Never in a pickle
Catch me chilling with the cavalry
That mean that I’m god-like
You bitches need salvaging
And I spit like a paint brush
That is painting out a masterpiece
And I am like a jungle full of motherfucking mega beasts
When I spit I break the first three letters of your legacy
Yeah, that mean I’m ill, ho
Yeah, that mean I drill so
Deep into these fields, slow
You should run cause I’m on your heels, hoe
You should run cause I’m on that pill flow
That super fucking real flow
That break a bitch neck then a fucking jet black??
Stomp her with high heels, flow
Kill me when these bitches fail in speaking that coherent shit
Did this on my own, bitch, on my single parent shit

My mind’s an art gallery
