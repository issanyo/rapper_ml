[Intro]
It's a wide, wide world (say yeah, say yeah)

[Verse 1]
It's probably not wise to love me
Hardest part is I don't talk with my mouth
Most of my thoughts are ugly
Oh, enough, enough talking about
How I feel inside, do you feel alright?
When I'm gone, you still feel alright?
And them heavy clouds got silver linings
But the light inside you make it feel so bright

Daisy's a baby, she's delicate
All of her petals have metal tips
She won't let you touch her, she's celibate
She want angels only, she's haven sent

She don't believe in God like she used to
She don't call or cry or pray no more
She take longer flights than most birds have wings
But when she touch down, she can't stay no more

I just keep saying, "why did you leave?"
I just keep asking her, "why not believe?"
She always says, "it's just not for me"
The trees still stand but what falls is what leaves (god damn)
I see what you mean
Hold on to nothing because everything leaves
Everything leaves, I guess on the ground that's all you can see

[Hook]
I know you're running
You've got nothing to hide
Searching for gardens
Hope you need what you find
Just sit still
You'll be here in time
I don't mind

[Verse 2]
Ohhh, I see you reaching for Him
Searching through weeds for his scent
You shouldn't be someone else
But when it's with you
In the palm of your hands
Love is commotion
And softer than sand

[Hook]
'Cause I know you're running
You've got nothing to hide
Searching for God
Hope you need who you find
Just sit still
He's out there somewhere

[Bridge]
Someone who loves
Someone who'll reach for themselves
Someone who does
You shouldn't be someone else
You should love, you should love
Yourself

[Spoken Outro]
Don't you ever wanna go back to Brooklyn?
Where the sun shines bright and things didn't hurt
Don't you ever wanna go back to Brooklyn?
Maybe rewind time and make things work
Those big green bright, bright eyes staring down at me
What a memory, huh
What a memory
