[Verse 1]
Since '91 I been a menace, for real
Born rotten and exposed
A rose in a garden full of hoes
A flowerbed of souls
Where the flowers never learn
They can go, they can grow, they can—
They can be something
I'm a bird, I'm a bird—
Look at me fronting
Been confused and obtuse, gotta mean something
I don't feel, I don't feel, I mean nothing
Mama look around, what you gotta say?
You probably never gave a fuck about me anyway
I know I'm foolish, 'cause I love you with my whole soul
But I keep running so, I ain't gotta home—
I don't wanna go home
Runnin' from the fire in my brains, in my ozone
Runnin' from the pressure 'till I cave in my own home
You don't understand the obsessions that I got
I need love, I don't feel that shit a lot, nigga
Been alone from the motherfuckin' jump, man
Every battle, every hurdle, every hump, man
Bitches either feel it or they motherfuckin'
Don't, man
Time to draw the line and do the motherfuckin'
*Snort*, man
Man, listen, I don't talk about myself, nigga, oh no
You don't get it, you don't feel it, nigga, oh no
Where I'm from is a nightmare, not a smoke show
Niggas never make it there, they never make it, oh no, nigga

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I'm from the generation of the scarred and abused
For real, man
You're either dead or you're dyin' or you doomed
And what's worse is nobody's got a clue
Of what the fuck that I go through in my brain
That there's a fuckin' beast of the motherfuckin' chain
That I be having dragons in my heart being slain
'Till I'm broken and too vulnerable again
Love—nobody ever showed me what it was, my nigga
For real
I've been beggin' since a youngin', since a cub, my nigga
For real
Saw into your pretty blue soul like the rainbow
My third eye saw your devil and your angel
We tried to love each other from a different angle
Unfortunately, we still got strangled
I don't even know if I'm-ma make it to the next day!
Every day, I wake up and I feel like it's my deathday!
You can see inside me like a motherfuckin' x-ray!
Losin' to my demons in a motherfuckin' chess game!
It's a hard life I choose to lead
The memories' so lucidly
I'm just speakin' truthfully
It's hard to breathe, it's hard to breathe, damn
