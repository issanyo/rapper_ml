[Spoken Intro]
"I remember being asked a lot, by a lot of different writers, zines, and shit, like, 'Why don't you incorporate your race, your ethnicity, where you've grown up, into your music?' I don't identify with that shit, like, my identity is the music, everything you need to know about me is in the music: my home, it's where I originate, it's where I fall apart, it's where I come to life."

[Verse 1]
Back in the booth let the tragedy in
Switched up the team, let the magic begin
Told all you haters, I'm in it to win it
Way back when them losers wasn't letting me in
All of these bitches is mad at me, so?
Money appeared now they magically foe
Honestly really can't pay it no mind
Because spending that time means I'd rather be broke
I'm out here living my passions and more
Witnessing peace as it pass through my soul
Nothing can irritate masses like literally showing them stagnance can turn into growth
Haters gon hate when you winning this shit
Done for these bitches, they tend to forget
I'm out here yelling 'bitch, look at me now!'
I was once underground, now I'm stuck in the clouds
14 whole hours, a trip out to Spain
High in the clouds, bitch I'm gulping the rain
Just a year later still fucking these haters
While facing my fears, no more running from pain
Head is on straight so I'm gunning with aim
No more fucking with bitches who stunting for fame
You can catch me out roofless in something deranged
Ain't it funny how suddenly something can change?

[Hook]
You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down
You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down

[Verse 2]
Back when the preacher said change is to come
All nonbelievers prepare to be sonned
Not talking Jesus but honest to God
I bet I reach my prime before air leaves my lungs
Switched it up bitches, adjusted my flow
Go against me and get wrecked from the go
All of you bitches keep taking your shots
But if one come at me, then it's straight for your throat
Harder than nipples on bitches aroused
Deity swag and omnipotent style
Don't fuck with my bread and don't fuck with my head
Cause if it get to that point then I'm seriously vile
Promise you people that evil's alive
Wish you could see what I see with my eyes
All of the demons that be in mind
So I burned all my bridges and cut all my ties
Said I would do this back when I was 9
Said I would do this before I got signed
Said I would give all these lost kids and doubters
A reason and purpose to question their lives
Look where I am and then look where I've been
Tell me that I ain't destined to win
Never give power to none of you cowards
To tell me what you think my destiny is

[Hook]
You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down
You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down

[Verse 3]
Gone for a minute but back on my grind
Promise you you are no match for my mind
Took all my doubt, whipped it into submission
And forced my ambition to step into line
I know that they do not want me to shine
I know that they do not want me to climb
I know inside that being a boss means making these bitches get back on their jobs
Can anyone fuck with me now? No
How do these bitches respond? Don't
Looking behind to seeing me now
What do they think I'm beyond? Dope
I've just be taking my time, slow
Being alone in my mind, flow
Putting the contents of all that's inside me into this shit I'm designed for
Crossover, pivot, I'm back in the game
NASCAR on bitches, I'm tracking my lane
Focused on bridging the gap
And showing the youth all the ways to accomplish their dreams
Know how it feels when they kicking you down
And it's getting you down
You gotta make the decision to be the one difference in your life and turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down
I know it's hard to be adamant, too
When you stand out like a sore thumb in the crowd
No niggas and bitches and quitters allowed
Ball inside you until the survival of your dreams
Until you are living them out

[Outro]
Everything that you need to know about me is in the music
My home is the music, it's where I originate
It's where I fall apart, it's where I come to life
