Girls you know you better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
It's been like a week since you've been looking for your friend
The one you let inside like a kitten in the rain
Remember when he told you he was 'bout them other things
Like blunts, like cunts, lean, and promethazine
But girl you acted like it really wasn't a thing
Didn't get the picture like you really out of frame
Remember when he told you he was 'bout them other things
That you were a fool for expecting him to change
But girl I guess you gotta live until you know
You should never love a man that will treat you like a hoe
Never love a man that'll fuckin' let you go
Never love a man more concerned with his dough
Or his bros, or his hoes, or his snow, or his blow
Never love a man that get you high and leave you low
If he cannot comprehend it, in the garbage he should go
Fuck her in her thighs, you, you're in your glow
Baby girl respect is so definitive
If he can't give it then it ain't no givin' in
I ain't tryin' to preach, since we all still come to sin
But don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Don't be treated like a 5 when you really are a 10
Don't be fooled by the misconceptions
If he can't treat you right then tell him come again, like
Come again, come again, come again
Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Look, the second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his friends, and the trends
More concerned with respect in the streets and the text
See the world in black and white like an NBA ref yo
Really should confess, that life ain't what it seems
Be less concerned with the trends, and more concerned with your dreams
See the world ain't as distorted and as morphed as it seems
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a king
King, can't you see it's really all a scheme
All designed to deter you from those bigger better things
More concerned with your clothes and the whores and jordans
That the world has made it seem that morals just ain't important
Boy, I guess you gotta live until you know
That the boy is not a man till he lives and he knows that
Women are the queens that require real men
But how you gonna win when you ain't right within
How you gonna win when you ain't right within
How you gonna win when you ain't right within
Yo nigga, come again
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Girls you know you better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
