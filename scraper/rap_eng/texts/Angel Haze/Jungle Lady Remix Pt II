Kitty, Kitty Cash, Cash
Exclusive

[Chorus: Jillian Hervey]
Tell me how you want it baby
You know you need a jungle lady
Make me go wild and crazy
So let's move into the dark
Tell me how you want it baby
You know you need a jungle lady
You know you should stay
Cause I'm never gonna take away my love
Oh ah, ah ah oh ah
I feel your love surrounding me
Oh ah, ah ah oh ah

[Pre-Chorus: Jillian Hervey]
Honey I'm rare and you know it
But I see you're special too
Been alone for a minute, and I could get used to you

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
You know me, I pull up
Lookin' like a fuckin' shoppin' spree
Don't ask what's in my pocket, you get nothing out of me
You say you're from the jungle, I was born with the trees
And I'm good with the head like I'm fuckin' Socrates, yo
Question for you, baby, love it's just hypothesis
I could make you feel like you're a thunderstorm on top of me
You come few and far between 'cause you need ration yeah
I think fucking's only good if it's with passion
If you gon' ride, gotta ride 'til it crashes
Lookin' for a real love, fuckin' if it's blast
I think to be honest I'm lookin' for truth
To someone I do not mind givin' my youth to
Treat you like a flower when it's thunder
Love you like your pedals can become dust
Every time I see you, you get wilder
I would love to be out here with you

[Chorus: Jillian Hervey]
Tell me how you want it baby
You know you need a jungle lady
Make me go wild and crazy
So let's move into the dark
Tell me how you want it baby
You know you need a jungle lady
Jungle lady, jungle lady

[Verse 2: Jillian Hervey]
Don't be shy, let's go and fall in love
And running through the dark and touch the moon above
Believe me, baby, I want you and I'd sing for you
Oh, baby, baby
I feel your love surrounding me

[Pre-Chorus: Jillian Hervey]
Honey I'm rare and you know it
But I see you're special too
Been alone for a minute
Been alone for a minute

[Outro: Jillian Hervey]
You know you need a jungle lady

[Outro: Kitty Cash]
Hey girl, ain't no mystery
At least as far as I can see
I want to keep you here
Laying next to me
Sharing our love between the sheets
Kitty Cash
