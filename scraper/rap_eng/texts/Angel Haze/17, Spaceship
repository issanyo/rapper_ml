Uh and then these bitches thought they had me
I’m already It and you ain’t even have to tag me
Shit, and its depressing cause’ my swag mean
You a bum and I be dressing like a drag queen
Get it? you know a dress? a drag queen
And my chain got more cuts then a bad seam
My nigga nice, me and him be like a tag team
Plus we keep it jumping til its squeaking like a bad spring
Angel fucking Haze tell them niggas check they casting
Jolie bitches no I ain’t about the acting
I’m above the line numerating like a fraction
But the whole game is what I’m steadily impacting
And, I keep it realer then the rest of you
So when I’m introduced I be like hello I’m the best to you
And I am the number that is left to two
I can’t wait no longer tell them bitches this is overdue

I was taught to want it and I did (and I did did)
Now I’m steady stacking fucking chips (getting dip dip)
All these other loose leaf bitches getting ripped (ripped)
I am running every body til’ they quit cause
I was taught to want it and I did (and I did did)
Now I’m steady stacking fucking chips (getting dip dip)
All these other loose leaf bitches getting ripped (ripped)
I am running every fucking body til’ they quit, (quit)

No one on the corner got swagger like us
Angel Haze Flyer then the magic school bus
Tell Ms. fickle I said wassup?
Tell my niggas I said they up
I don’t be tripping not giving a fuck
I’m putting you down and living it up
But angel fucking haze be the name don’t forget it ho
I think I’m insane, I’m deranged, I am difficult, They won’t let me loose like I was chained to a fence befo’ and If they say I ain’t good Then they lame they just cynical
Everybody critics tho
Boy I got that bender flow
Pinned up paper you could tell them I’m the cynafold, bitch
Please just do not copy my penmen ship
And I stay in first you would swear that I invented it
And they sell me vintage shit
Yo flow like a sinking ship
Listen to the hook my money stacking like a pringle chip
Dolla’ bill swag boy I’m always on my single shit
Yours glaucoma, blurry, you can’t see me bitch

I was taught to want it and I did (and I did did)
Now I’m steady stacking fucking chips (getting dip dip)
All these other loose leaf bitches getting ripped (ripped)
I am running every fucking body til’ they quit
I was taught to want it and I did (and I did did)
Now I’m steady stacking fucking chips (getting dip dip)
All these other loose leaf bitches getting ripped (ripped)
I am running every fucking body til' they quit (quit)
