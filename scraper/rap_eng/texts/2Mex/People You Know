People You Know
[Verse 1: Pawz One]
Being far beyond driven has driven me far beyond
Anything that I envisioned, I got my tickets, I'm gone
Now it's on, im drawn to the music Pros and the cons
Landing at JFK and haters standing on the lawn
Drinking the same 40oz, same stories all the time
He can rap, but he's too busy, He's living a life of crime
Never held his own, he's Al Capone inside his own mind
Paranoid and bugging Thinks they listen on his phone line
Focus on my own grind, the feeling is good
It's a shame to come back and see him still in the hood
See, some homies went to college, others signed up for the navy
And that girl that had potential, you can find her with a baby
Kid's daddy is missing, A loser with no ambition
Seems like time's frozen, He's stuck in the same position
And You can catch him tweaking in his house with a gun
And he ain't left the block since 2001

[Verse 2: Pawz One]
See, a dude I used to know, He's got 45 kids
Struggled to handle biz, He's barely filling his fridge
Catch him at the liquor store trying to bum a cig
But if you hear him tell it, he's always doing it big
Save it for the bitches you're trying to run game on
His baby mom's a chick they used to all run a train on
Gonorrhea Flame on, Burning to take a piss
Got her name on his neck, tatted next to her lips
Ain't that a trip? Years go by, letting him slip
Still cruising by the high school to check out the chicks
The homie's 26, still using the dirty tricks
In his girl's car, Radio up, bumping the system
Wait for the bell to ring to find himself a victim
Girls, don't be distracted by the image and the looks
It's harder to carry babies than it is to carry books

[Verse 3: 2Mex]
Up in Mid-City, California, 1981
Sycamore Avenue, right off La Brea and Washington
You see, it wasn't that fun
Watching people smoke crack from the barrel of a gun
I seen this one dude do someone foul
Someone killed him and cut off his dick and straight left it in his mouth
I know that shit sound wild, and for the
Next 10 years I had to walk by the house
I used to get lectured everyday by the neighborhood
Wino, He ended up disappearing or dying far as
I know, My neighbor used to smoke rocks
And he used to try to break in my car a whole lot
One time, he broke into my ride and ended up
Getting me for my Blaupunkt, I thought I locked the door. but I must've forgot one
And I'm so motherfucking dumb, yo
But that's the norm where I come from
I was a church kid, which means I would be
Outside of mass selling Mexican sweet breads, like a merch kid
And yo, I most definitely wasn't the worst kid
But people talked about my parents being poor like we weren't
Worth shit, That's why I had to prove them wrong, though
That's why I had to do more with my self then attend Rio Hondo
And straight smoking on this chrondo
Over 20 years of music and now its on though
