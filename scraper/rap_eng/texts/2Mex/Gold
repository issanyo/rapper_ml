[Verse 1: Linoskiii]
Yo, just ask around who the hardest is
I make EP's and burn CD's myself like an arsonist
I'm no puppet, I flow couplets of gold touch in every single soul I meet even though my shit's low budget
I make records in a garage at my homie's place but get a lot of love though, homie, based on the shows I play
Known today, but hopefully remembered long for days
I'm known to start my fan's apologies for a long delay
My songs display thoughts that I long to say
Like how I rap my problems to cope with life in a stronger way
Based on my catalog, you'll see I do this part time
But when I do make music, I make local rappers flat line
My fat rhymes are pretty much what make my tracks tight
Y'all be at my knees, when it comes to rapping, I'm Shaq's height
I find it funny how some people go to school for this but they ain't half as dope as the people I'm making music with

[Lino:] Yo, you ain't messing with the set, I'm On A High Note
[2Mex:] I'm the Mexican Descent
[Lino:] Lino Skywalker
[2Mex:] 2Mex
[Lino:] Got respect for my OG's
[2Mex:] 2Mex, you know I got respect for my little homies
[Lino:] Yo, you ain't messing with the set, I'm On A High Note
[2Mex:] I'm the Mexican Descent
[Lino:] Lino Skywalker
[2Mex:] 2Mex
[Lino:] Got respect for my OG's
[2Mex:] 2Mex, you know I got respect for my little homies

[Verse 2: 2Mex]
From Mid-City to Koreatown [?]
Blown out of you limiters pass, your perimeter sounds similar and we brown
Like a farm worker, we the song workers, you're just an onlooker, on your arm, hookers trying to get you for your pocketbooks
Let me show you how we rock it, look
We hold bitches like an octopus
And when you talk of us, you better use the correct [?]
2Mex, the master interpretive
And the homie, Linoskiii, the young Jedi about to smash all the finest hyna that's up in this bitch
We On A High Note [?]
We yelling [?]

[Lino:] Yo, you ain't messing with the set, I'm On A High Note

[Lino:] Got respect for my OG's
[2Mex:] 2Mex, you know I got respect for my little homies
[Lino:] Yo, you ain't messing with the set, I'm On A High Note
