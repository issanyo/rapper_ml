[Verse 1]
Baby
I'll talk you into this hope avoid these hockey skates to the throat
Walk with me through this psychiatric hat-trick let's go
I don't have the ability nor the agility to enter your nightmares and pull you through the humility of what your deepest darkest secrets mean to be
I just don't, want you, to be mean to me
If this chemical, the feeling is identical to the suffocating suction of a octopus's tentacle it's not
But this situations clinical but know
That our salvation is critical
Whatever it is, if not the subject of ridicule just don't ever think that I would ever wanna get rid of you
There's nothing more beautiful, that when I enter the inner you the louder we interface the more we're in outer space
The ward that we seem to face, or the door to the divinity of the infinity that we always seem to chase

[Hook]
Embrace the mental illness that fills your mental wellness
'Cause bein' well, well, means you go to the well
I said well, let's be real, we're all a little off the beaten path
Some of us cheated death and some of us just cheat at math
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Listen
My mind, is always under attack
I'm under the radar but overly conscious watching my back
The lack, of understanding for so long gives me a cramp
I could only fly for so long and high, off of this ramp
The inner workings of a complex mind, can't be diagrammed
Much less, put to perfect poetry, but I'll try a gram
Can there be a way for me and my girl, to be insane yet utterly humane
And I live a life, in vain, the pain within the painting is a painting of the same
When you paying for the painting you payin', for the frame
A frame of mind, is sturdy yet colors runnin' the rain as they run off the painting and overlap
The frame, the painting disappear, as the colors become stains, and some view it as a problem
Colors do not sustain, whats left is just the frame, and a very caustic stain
And the philosophy, to create once again

[Hook]
Embrace the mental illness that fills your mental wellness
'Cause bein' well, well, means you go to the well
I said well, let's be real, we're all a little off the beaten path
Some of us cheated death and some of us just cheat at math
