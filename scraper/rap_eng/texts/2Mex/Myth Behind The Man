Journey to the farthest reaches
The myth behind the man
To uncover the darkest secrets
The myth behind the man
Though they will not all believe us
Two sets of footprints in the sand
Listen to what God can teach us
There’s always a myth behind the man

(Abstract Rude)
In attempt to find his lost land
Across the seas and skies
We sail and fly
Just so we could find a peace of mind
The stronger one gets the upper hand
And that was all planned
Intentionally
Men are free truly when they have identity
The borders we cross in foreign land
The soil
The sand
Come into your own and they won’t even shake your hand
Uncommon man
I was stranded
But made the most of here
Commanded mostly by fear
Of God and a government
Absence of love
When it leaves your heart you cannot feel compassionate
Rational thought
When you’re stuck in the land of the lost
Who will claim you?
All we have is us and a shameful world
And a baby laid in a manger
Journey to the farthest reaches
The myth behind the man
To uncover the darkest secrets
The myth behind the man
Though they will not all believe us
Two sets of footprints in the sand
Listen to what God can teach us
There’s always a clue between the lines
And if you pursue
Then you’ll find
Through keys and scrolls
Holy books
We chose to look
Days of the calendar stole by crooks
Thieves in the graves who open tombs
You woke the souls
Of another dimension when you broke the mold
You just keep digging ‘till you can’t dig no more
Froze in a mummy wrap
Snap goes the booby trap
It’s too sacred and ancient the artifact
And some things in life are best left alone
So watch the ground you’re stepping on
Some secrets gained once you leave this earthly plane
Archeologists will search in vain
With hypothesis of what pertains to dirt and rain
To wind and fire
Verses blood in your veins
Is the one messiah in every religion the same?
That was risen from flames
I was given the name
Planted on rugged terrain
Well welcome to the game

(2Mex)
Journey to the farthest region
I wonder if my father’s leaving
Off balance
Author of the uneven
To be the chalice from which the sun’s breathing
From the cardiovascular
To the heart of an asteroid
Implode the louder void
Summarize the book of silence
Close your eyes and look through your eyelids
See through global satellite tracking
Flee from un-noble acolytes attacking
And that feeling of forsaking
Is a feeling of awakening
Pace yourself as the autumn omits vapors
Paste yourself to the bottom of the paper
Chase yourself until you finally feel safer
Erase yourself
Hologram
The myth behind the man
Take a stand
The width you find is grand
I examine the diameter
Try to be a man or die amateur
