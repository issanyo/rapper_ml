[Chorus] [x4]
Bust, like never before
Must, come back to settle the score
Just, a casualty of war
Us, we better for sure

[Verse 1 - 2Mex]
If I battle my personal demons
I could make a whole personal of humans suffocate in the flames
Afterlife is claim, scientifical name
Controling words in a world with different cults name
Take significant aim
And even in your past life you was not harder
You were either a stealer of inventions or a martyr
Every time 2mex style are mented, Of Mexican Descent
You have either been exiled or fermented
Will Funkalicious turning into [??gattaca??]
Reload like Metallica
Memorizing Encyclopedia Britannica
If the Pope's afraid to die then what about you
Even he's afraid of the power of the Afterlife Crew

[Chorus] [x4]
Bust, like never before
Must, come back to settle the score
Just, a casualty of war
Us, we better for sure

[Verse 2 - Ellay Khule]
Whos the ultimate?
Your crews can't cope with it
Did they have as dope as it get
And I hope you knew they bit
Bottom bottom, please be a better rider
Five fiver when I'm lookin' for a lotta
Higher hotter materialist mode
First string from Project Blowed
Your moves exude so slow
To the next interlude, we go
But never close amigos, we bag ?rebos?
?[reminding decoys]?
Like tryna get dough, tryna get a dick sucked
I'mma come easy like a quick bug
Keep bugging around, you're gonna get cut
Zoo dirt lay low, can time ?[throw my fists up]?
Physical abuse just one hickabus
I know them subs weren't meant for us
I stay in bed all day [????????????]
Caught up in a whirldwind, get tossed
All of a sudden they just wanna push my buttons like I'm a fucking elevator
Time of Doomsday, detonator
No names in the game, they turn heads
I burn in the treasures in the clans favor
Watch for the man, flavor afford it
Least you wanna do, leave first stroke crew
Yo rep crew couldn't afford it

[Chorus] x2
Bust, like never before
Must, come back to settle the score
Just, a casualty of war
Us, we better for sure

[Verse 3 - Wreccless]
[?????????] docks
Glocks blow you out yo socks
Plant yo rocks, plant your chest and grab your AK
Exploitation for a foul rap
In a demonstration, relocation is what ya facin'
And the time you're wastin, all bets im placin'
Machetein' niggas like I was Jason
No concentration cuz all these niggas be getting too cocky
Don't stop me, nigga just watch me
Chop the ponzi, a black Ghadafi
Makin all these niggas get above me
Its my scandal
Grabbin it out the back
Feels like I'm Randall
6 foot 3, 2-3-5, I'm hard to handle
Understand you'll get cut up in the human circumcisum
Got infrared lasers, running my circular rivers
I kill 'em, that's what they're yellin'
From the halls I hail
With a rhymeless silence no hope tryin' us
Get back artists dwell
No definition or gas to engine your ship  might fall apart
Nigga got 1 arm 1 leg and a nigga got a hole in his heart
2-2, cartons of cigarettes lets giddy up on my hustle horse
????? cord
Slicing niggas, pedestrians not believin' the lord
Without [????]
A niggas needs to slapped into a slim gym
My synonimes, adjectives, predjucates
Are considered ridiculous
