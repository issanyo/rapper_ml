[Verse 1: 2Mex]
Linoskiii hit me with the contact
Infameezy hit with me with the dope track
Now I'm in the booth about to bless you with throwback
To when the style was the king
L.A. underground, homie fuck your bling bling
Got my Dodger game going on all season
Showing how to get a party started
[?] that I can pay my phone bill

[Verse 3: Linoskiii]
I slept through and let them flow first
L.A. underground, about to hit you with the dope verse
Since the day of my birth I was meant to grab a pen and spit them rhymes upon this earth
And I would walk around the planet eating beats of habit, trying to find someone who truly gets my thoughts and understands them just a little bit
Wishing I didn't have to stress but I learned how to deal with it
We got the style [?] insecurities
