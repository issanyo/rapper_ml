[Chorus x4]
You swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on
No need in bringing it back cause' they've never really gone

[Verse 1 - 2Mex]
I met this girl named Araceli
In her car and on her celly a sullen girl
Always jealous of Kelly
And Kelly her sister
Behind that building I kissed her
But I couldn't get her
Out of her kelly green sweater
Besides I like my baby
[?]
Helen a never and
Would be a serving the living in her underlivin'
With her friend Gwendelyn
Gwendelyn looks like
Glenda without the melanin and hair more like Marilyn from the universe that she [?]
She's a [?]
[?] a ten
But she's terribly in the trend
And trending is a way to be
If you were Wendy and took her to Wendy's
[?]
And we loan each other fetty' but she never seem to pay me back it don't offend me
Let me tell you bout' the time I dated Emmy
We went to the Emmy's
And we were faded off of Remy they gave a Emmy
To Jennifer playing Effie
And another one to Michael McKean for playing Lenny
And let me end this off by saying women drive me insane
From [?] crying up on me in the rain
I'm sorry
I'll try my best to maintain my sanity afterwards if you look like a [?]

[Bridge]
Just that old-fashioned love song played on the radio
And after all the music is the sound of someone promising they'll never go

(So live and die for you its still live and die)

[Verse 2 - Ceschi]
Oh it's the same old story
From the after-show groupies to the jealousy-beaten beauties to the forgotten faces of floozies
Living within a limo of lunacy and lust
Insignificant fucking leaves you nothing but some sort of mental love
Now I don't want to just
Fuck and be leaving
I want something with meaning not some random girl sucking my semen up on the weekends leavin' my dummy love in the dreamin' never givin' me any reason to stop settling for the leeches

I met this girl
Her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone
When I met Joan
I took her home
She was just like a doggie all on my bone

I met another girl
Her name was Ann
All she ever wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann
I shook her hand
We ended up freaking by a garbage can

When will I ever find some stability of mind
Future tangled up into the abyss something you [?] shredded a thousand times
It feels like I've been burned to the stake like fifty times
While a team of taxidermists sucks out all my insides
And I've been hopelessly searching for the perfect kind of love for my heart but every time it feels close I get ripped apart

So I'm just running away and settling for the nearest wet pussy sedative till the rest of me decays
Thanks, Helen

[Bridge]
Just that old-fashioned love song played on the radio
And after all the music is the sound of someone promising they'll never go

[Chorus x2]
You swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on
No need in bringing it back cause' they've never really gone

[Verse 3 - Awol One]
I knew this girl
Her name was cloud
She like it when my hip-hop was loud
Bass so heavy it shakes her shoes
And now my raps
Smell like the blues

I met this girl
Her name was robot
She sang backwards and knew how to grow pot
Had a tattoo on the inside of her thigh
That always got wet when my song made her cry

I knew this woman
Called her mom
Crack made her thoughts all twisted wrong

I met this chick
Her name was the hell of it
Knew all the words to Freestyle Fellowship

I knew this lady
Queen of the world
Cool as shit so I made her my girl

I knew this chick and made her rope out of shellfish
She was the mermaid she would sell fish

[Bridge]
Just that old-fashioned love song played on the radio

[Chorus X2]
You swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on
No need in bringing it back cause' they've never really gone

[Bridge]
Just that old-fashioned love song played on the radio

[Outro X6]
From the heart
To the soul
To the mind

The leaves are the struggle that we all go through
