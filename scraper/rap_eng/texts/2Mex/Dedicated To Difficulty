We dedicate this to difficulty
Even if for a minute
Only infinitely lonely
The dream is dead
There's no pony
A pain that you know only

You pushed away the last person that was ever gonna be kind
The television is so loud yet no one seems to mind
Cause everybody’s out of their mind
I'm coming to rescue you but no one's coming to mine
My blood's infected with neglect
The love you expect wouldn't even pass a health check
Ever feel like you're not alone?
Never been realer to me than the day you sat on your phone
In and out of space via satellite clones
Gather database said I was destined to be alone
I'm too complacent
Coming to your place quick
Your eyes either evade me or play sick
It doesn't even matter now
You take a million showers but you still dirty the towel
Right, somebody thinks you're pretty?
Wow
Take a pretty bow cause I think you're pretty foul

I dedicate this to you walking away backwards
“Get the fuck away from me” are my exact words
As I hide under a gray cloud on a dead tree with a black bird
There's poison in your saliva
There's a noise that we made inside that's no longer alive
I don't care if you cry
Fuck it
I don't care if you die
I thought I had defeated the youth
But if I was wrong about you, I might be wrong about the truth
One day, there'll be a better you, a better me
But for now you're dead to me

This song may seem insignificant and sloppy
But I keep it simple and sell a million copies
Then you'll really feel it when you hear it in the lobby
It's obvious that hurting is your hobby
I hope this moment ruins your favorite movie
I hope they don't design a drug that does what you do to me
Until then, I'll always be fixated
'Til someone breaks your heart and you can't mixtape it
