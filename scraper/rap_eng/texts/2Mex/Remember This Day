[Verse 1: Dax]
I had to bend the rules to straighten it out
I penciled in the picture then erased the doubt
You wouldn't let me in the party so I turned it out
Put my words into action to show you what I'm about
Had to rewrite the rhythm and gave y'all a chance to
Dance to the beat of a different drum, a chance to
Change your crew's placement or position
With passionate permanence, permanent patience
Forever favoring friction, my diction stays heated
I mainline rhyme when y'all spit it, I bleed it
Call it conceited, fall in line and I'll lead it
You hate the way I do it but you know that you need it
I could flip it and New Breed it
Head tripping, pencil tip lead gripping, grip it if I feel
Instead I choose to pimp it while I taunt you
Cause that's the only way I know
So best believe, I'ma get what I want dude

[Verse 2: 2Mex]
[?] spirits hailing the same heaven
2Mex all of my lyrics ain't playing the game seven
Water soluble all of your daughters [?]
All of your sons are [?] world problems are solvable
Probable cause, humble abominable pause
Stumble and I'ma be your gauze
Band aid and CDs are handmade
No tax, no Dax for no facts, Tunnel Rats

[Verse 3: Neogen]
Real deal healing herbs to urge remedy
Reel to reel peel then burned the term ebony
Wheels square meals of verbs we serve heavily
Still we'll squeeze this earth so there'll never be
No doubt stuff your mouth with jet energy
Ear drums stay poking out like they wanna see
What's the commotion 'bout? Love and the harmony
Rolling the carpets out, now [?]

[Verse 4: Dert]
Don't trip, I been doing this before them zip disks
Before the [?], I used to partake [?]
Never lost [?] defied law shape shift with
Ever provoked, I morph into Hulk and drop beats by the boat
My MPC is bullet proof, the hottest in or out the booth
I start beef for practice leaving cats in disbelief
The producer outrapped us

[Verse 5: Reconcile]
For centuries regiments [?] never be elementary
Leaving [?] locked up in the penitentiary
There's no need to hate or debate it
This is inevitably how it's meant to be
Got enough tenacity in my personality to defy the laws of gravity
Ripping through your chest cavity
Dividing spirit from the thoughts and intents of the listening youth
The underground ministry is living proof

[Verse 6: Professor Who]
Spoken a thought process over Dert beats
Concept connect dots like constellations
Neuron bracing information across
A super highway to make it in time
From real to [?] TRz amazing design
Recognize how we seem to redefine these
Preconceived ideas you had in mind
The moment you heard us quote you chose to remain silent
Open mind like satellites receptive to Christ-elligence

[Verse 7: Dokument]
I'm 400 pounds plus of ground rush
Like a lion, when I move around the sound hush
The juggernaut footsteps I leave in concrete
The streets is full of dirt and germs like my beats
I peace the war get popped quick
Our arsenal [?] optics can lock your false bliss
And all this can get leveled in a second
Now the place where you were living is forever where you resting

[Verse 8: Chosen1]
The passion provokes me to protect [?]
When I flow these life returning words
That are curved when I first heard the
Urge in your rhymes, hurdle I purge and the ground's thirsty
For seeds in your words, freak on your nerves
This beat's dirty
Running through something bubbly complimented with substance
[?] working with nothing
And after the [?] rises, the whole nation be buzzing
While we stunting your cousin's cousin
All you rappers bit the dust

[Verse 9: Griffin]
I had enough but in a sense not, that's why I'm flexing
These dope bars are permanent scars that I've collected
Demonstrating passion while bashing your whole selection
Too much for the passive while others just can't accept it
We play for keeps, dropping tension on crazy beats
What the church thinks are hostile, we taking it to the streets
Enough of the hype, you either marching or you slipping
Wake up, it's the Sunrise player, my name is Griffin

[Verse 10: Lazarus]
When brothers [?] who rap like classic is bogus
Capture the minds of the youngest to oldest
We confuse 'em like they Florida voters
I'm the smallest but boldest
Bring the heat when it's snowing the coldest
You better believe it's just the beginning
Continuing the winning tradition, stay in position
Man rattling the son of perdition, we winning
[?] vision underground and the rise consuming the living

[Verse 11: Raphi]
You must be joking
They ain't even knowing what they provoking
Pistol lick pump smoking dump and something gon' be broken
We living for more than what you stand for, rookie
I spit wrath a paragraph, that's a crime book me
Cali stay quicks never shook me, how?
Made you open up your eyes boy, look at me now
I stay focused, you hopeless better wish upon a star
It's Mr. Big Dipper ripping you with one bar

Part 2

Hey, check-check it out, hold on hold on, check it out!

[Intro: Drastic & Propaganda]
Yo but can I bust?
One time please, can I bust?
Let 'em know, champ, let 'em now

[Verse 12: Drastic]
Dragon slayer, came to pay ya a visit
Display exquisite syllabic wordplay
Arrhythmic killer instinct
Sword slay any lizard who dare risk it
No fear, who is it?
Who stand against me?
Get scimitar taste, steak souffl√© the recipe
All day come get it
You and your mans be straight up missed me
The raw way, fed it to the public
Yeah, you know they loved it

[Verse 13: Propaganda]
I'm like watch me now, quick to move the crowd
Speaking way too loud
Filthy reputation to bring truth and live shrouds
'Til you mind bending, stage rocking, folks talking
Mocking modern ideology, Propa-G a prodigy
Purpose serendipity ripping thee not to mention
You can't stand humidity, get behind up out of the kitchen
Flip the cross solar system, we be tunnel visioning
Feet remain plant 'til rap's full circumcision

[Verse 14: Macho]
I can't separate the pen from my heart
Even if it means missing the charts
And if it means only rhyming at parks
Too much love for the art
Compromise the name Jesus and the tension it sparks
Man this pen ain't the ticket I'm putting my trust in
Scale wars busting through troops, power to crush kings
Can't rush things, so I take it easy
Keep integrity, never gotta make it sleazy

[Verse 15: Raphi]
Sleazy easy like the breeze be flying through the air
I'm your worst nightmare swear but I ain't [?]
Brush through the bust when you wanna hit the breaks
I'm great, elevate, got a song called Motivate
On Tunnel Vision, [?] Cali
I'm a bad dream, you better press rewind
Fine when I come off the top of the mind
You gonna resign, that's my rhyme designed to climb

[Verse 16: Macho]
We keep it moving, somebody else
It's like this, take the lyric book off of the shelf
It's in your mind when I rhyme inside the air time
Ayo my man [Zo?] wanna come with the flow

[Verse 17]
You don't understand why we came through
Really doesn't matter what you think because we still do
What we gotta do right here right now, you understand
Why we raise up our right hand in the name of the Lamb
All y'all cats don't understand why we rap this
It seems like all y'all cats just need to practice
You can't step to this, we map it out for everybody that...
