Baby I ain't joking
And its not what I'm smoking
I really think your nice (*4X*)

[2Mex]
We are the love that is hard to love
My name is 2Mex metaphor Mork from ork
Looking for my monogamous Mindy
While your girl envy
Desire a girl to befriend me
But not to entirely up in me
I have pictures of a woman that I love in an album day dreaming of a
Different out come
I wear my art on my sleeve
As hard as it seems my heart rips apart at the seams and bleeds

[Awol One]
Some times she's so beautiful
Its like when ever she's angry
But why would someone who's so pretty and smart
Fall in love with an underground MC

[2Mex]
Ha!
I took you to the darkleaf concert
You said you never heard of them
How cool is that
So I went to your room and read your diary
Took you to the how and showed you turntables
And then my heart stared listening to hip hop blends
Yo fall in love all over again

Baby I ain't joking
And its not I'm smoking
I really think you're nice (*2X*)

[Awol One]
She doesn't have the Cinderella syndrome
Hard like a drummer summer color skin tone
Shes like a cardiac still beating
From the top of the cloud to the bottom of the reef
The shark smells blood from a mile a way
Shes like a beautiful mermaid with legs
Well I love you so much that I'm hating your guts
And all I need is your everlasting touch

[Awol One]
Some times she's so beautiful
When ever she's angry
But how could someone so pretty and smart
Fall in love with an underground MC

[Awol One]
You stuck your head on my chest and you ripped out my heart
While its still beating in your hands
When it gets broke it won't heal or recover
Its this point in time this love we discover
I'm crossing my t's
And dotting my i's
And signing my name in blood
Waters thicker than mud
It never helped to bring up the past
I talk so slow cause my mind moves fast
Because
Some times she so beautiful
It's like when ever shes angry
But why would someone who's so pretty and smart
Fall in love with an underground MC

Baby I ain't joking
And its not I'm smoking
I really think your nice (*2X*)

We are the love thats hard to love
We are the love thats hard to love
We are the love thats hard to love
We are the love thats hard to love
