[Verse One: LMNO]
I'm the luggage packer
Carson traveler
Deciding factor
Occasional slacker
Which came first, The vinyl or the lacquer?
I'm a rhythm attracter
Flabbergasted, we outlasted forever after
Hearing hateful laughter
LMNO is a word crafter
From inner Earth, not outer space, the out laster
As a fan, I hear too much blabber
Too many jaws jabber
Gear never made the rapper, reminder
In order to fit, get the adapter
I see them drunk off their own wine, I'll be the cracker
Revelation 22, close up the chapter

[Big Oak]
I be the next up to bat, wide open stance
Lead the league in dope rhymes and leaving MC's no chance
I swing a hefty mic and carry with it lofty goals
That's why I write these pieces and put off my thesis
My verbal attack will leave rappers off balance
They talk about a challenge, but uh, where's their talent?
Mine is intact from this track that's apparent
Heard from this assault well it's clearly our fault
It's Leo, bruises ego's on the low
Precision incision from subterranean position
Joined by these five wordsmiths
We're here to outshine and surpass all those upsurd hits
And finally, to all the non believers
It's time to realize that this fam runs deep like wide receivers

[Kazi]
I'm like a warpath genius, dropping science for a living
So catch me in my dungeon mixing chemicals with treason
I got the remedy, better yet the main ingredient
So stop your run force, cause to me you're disobedient
I mean this
I'm no joke
I got it to a science
Lyrically I'm here to tell brothers to stop trying
The ill motivator, hear me now and see me later
Strictly staying underground, that's how I make my meal paper
Check my method capability, turn you into oddity
You're faking jacks cat, so to me you're just an enemy
Brah, I stay high without the negative charge
Keep my skills elevated, why you biting my bars?
Oh yeah, I leave you something that your crew can feel
Kamicause the mastodon better guard your grill

[Hook] {x2}
DJ's
Rock the beat with your hands
MC's
Rock the mic if you can
LMNO
And the Lexicon
Kazi, Iriscience, SonGodSuns

[Verse Two: Rakaa Iriscience]
Ayo I passed crazy cattle, rode in, blazing saddles
Half [?] and half looking for battle
Gemini divided
Hexagon, six sided
Dead aim, crack shot, Lexicon invited
Off shrooms, I slide in the saloon at noon
Three eyes play the goon as I sweep the room
I rest, mic check, gun check, vest check
Then this honey press the side of my table like vestects
Clear the throat to read the note
Exhale, I free the smoke
Word travels fast round here, that go for broke
Step to the dusty roads and I fear no foes
I gotta go, six shooters and I let shit go

[Nick Fury]
Yo I've had it up to here, I got this much to go
You should be happy my defense is to flow
Because if it were otherwise, you other guys
Might make your next appearance with some bruised under eyes
It is I
Nick Fury, MC in disguise
Give a dap to the sun, me and him, we both rise
It's been hard work like button flies, now it's open
Me and hip hop, we this close to eloping
No joking
Kids are quiet once I have spoken
And when I leave the cipher there's a lot of dreams broken
I'm hoping y'all feel this, but please no groping
Or we may bash elbows like Oakland
Live and outspoken
Man I keep my camp concentrated
Take a step back, admire what we've created

[2Mex]
My hip hop history is the difference between
Hollywood Hulk Hogan and Hunter Hearst Helmsley
The SonGodSuns
My name is 2Mex
I'm looking for Goldberg, ah who's next?
I perfect plex
Preliminary palookas
I turn into 2Mex Superfly Snuka
Much like Rick Flair, master of the figure four
SonGodSuns but six never metaphor
Lacerating leg lock all of your lyrics
Until they all die like all the Von Erichs
My cassettes are made of gasoline
I'm the man who knocked Sid Vicious out of wrestling
