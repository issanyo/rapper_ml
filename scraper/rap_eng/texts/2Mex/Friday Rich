Why you always lying homie, oh my god

Big Game Huntaz

[Verse]
My name is 2Mex and open you eyes
I'm not a star, but chance's are
Kendrick Lamar play's my music in his car
And even if he doesn't
This L.A underground influence is permanently buzzing
Through the hearts and the minds of this world as a whole
Even if they wanna pretend and act like they don't know
In the last decade or so
Some of the biggest hip hop groups on the globe
Have take from Project Blowed
I don't really have the time to expose all the fraud
But we spoiled all the children and spared to many runts
Maybe i'm just to much of a lyrical style snob
I just come from a place where Odd Future's not that odd
The gods have shined down on this new generation
But i'm still waiting around for some new innovation
See life's a bitch when you're ahead of your time
And the rest of the planet is still learning how to rhyme
It's funny, when I hear these song all the time
Acting like you came up with the little styles you design
This industry is just like the blind leading the blind
If you really wanna find the origins of your mind then, ahh
Take a look at hip hop thats hard to find
Pay respect to the elders and architects of the time
This time you see the world for the hologram that it is
You to busy tryna' turn up and tryna' get in this biz and die


I'm taking it back to Masta Ace, Me and the Biz
I don't really care if you really get my references
The difference is people say it is what it is
But what it is now it's just garbage
To many clone seeds, over-populating the harvest
I'm not trying to kill the little high from your dab
But imagine if everybody on earth had a slab
But not everybody mastered the recipe in the lab
And ah, peace to my o.g homies still dropping tabs
Hoping they [wouldn't remember?]
While you were popping tags
And ah, I come from a place that everybody would sag
Y'all new rappers are just actors getting your sack
And ah, this cypher based on the energy of your aura
We all been way to selfish and should prepare fo war
While your caught up in celebrity worship wanting more
Your digital profile uploads all in storage
Stop worrying about who supposedly shot Phora
Thats some shit only bitches step into like Sephora
I'm at war with the evil thats tryna' harvest your soul
Your romanticising over things you really can't control
On the low i've been running this city as whole
Playing both role of the hero and villian to gain control
Peace to the cloud maker and the little homie wino
I'm provoking myself severely i'm on a high now
Shout out to 'namic and the little homie lenoski
Thats who i'm putting my money on to win on the low-key
O.T genesis ain't going up on a tuesday
It's just a temporary distraction april fools day, ahh
Only in the tomb of the writers my brothers jewels lay
The rule say get older and go away soon
But I say that knowledge is in a mason
Or others shining this of innovation
I've come down to a real revalation that positive energy
Activates constant elavation
And through meditation
I've leaped forward in time to bring you this infomation
You keep telling me to turn up
But everywhere I turn all hear the same beat word up
Burned up, all of my usless calories
It's not about a salary it's all about reality
Everybody in the world raps now its insanity
I know you're just trying to live out your childhood fantasy
You work hard all week
I know that's life a bitch
So when friday comes you become friday rich
And all that bullshit music that you bump all week
Becomes the real fantasy that you seek and, ah
And when the pay check comes you run to the bar
So you can be the video rap star
It's hard for you to care about truth and the pain
Let the poets be the poets and the jesters entertain
The fame is contagious throughout all the ages
To me i'm all about the pages, the pages, the pages
I'm all about the pages, the pages, the pages
I'm all about the pages, the pages, the pages
I'm all about the pages, the pages, the pages
The pages, the pages, the pages ahh
