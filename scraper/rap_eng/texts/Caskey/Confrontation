[Caskey]
Let the new and the old school connect
Respect is universal when great minds collide
Under well arrange planet and stars
I damage ya car
And play a lick inside the spanish guitar
Ash ya cigar out the window, the routine of new kings
Enlightenment tips and hits of blue dream
I'm reading scripts from the prophecy
Like god damn we about to do things
Pedals get pushed to the floor, flow traumatic
My girl hands wave out the window, it's Illmatic
She tell me, why don't you play some Mackavelli
Aye, I'm like cool, give me some head
I'm headlining shows in all states
Drunk, sober, high, in addittion to fifty
You call late, i'm all straight
You still callin' up All-State
Like aw, wait we got in some shit in the parlay
I'm politician fraudulent emcees for lies told
I leave 'em dead with my eyes closed
Me and the outlaws outlining the 5-0's
And body chalk
And contacting the Pirus
Set the city on fire
Any opposition get a facial upon ties
And laid in the archives
Man and you can force the issue with their lies
Or just pieces of the dark side

[Chorus]
You don't want no shit with us dog (x2)
We some killers in disguise
And if it comes that one is penalized and this is demise
Never been okay with livin' lies homie
So keep yo' head up to the sky homie
And pray that you never encounter my homies
So pray that you never encounter my homies, forreal
Keep yo' head up to the sky homie
You don't want no shit with us dog (x3)
Never been okay with livin' lies homie
So keep yo' head to the sky homie
And pray that you never encounter my homies

[Yonka Boi]
I'm too nice nigga, no i'm not a nice nigga
Mind set of a dyke cause i don't like niggas
Cross me or the team and that's your life nigga
Ya we rich and we famous this the life nigga
Come back with that fo-five like i'm mike nigga
Ya i really do shit you just a might nigga
Still spending that cash and we just swipe nigga
Never going left, i'm just a right nigga
Some pretend to be frauds or criminals
Or online thugs who only sendin' subliminals
Love to be back up in Yonkers movin' minerals
But in a year I'm in Florida like a Seminole
Gator face when you pass by, no friendly shit
Niggas wanna hate on the swag but they envy it
Niggas only fuck with you close when they benefit
Separate my self from the lames, that's the end of it

[Chorus]
You don't want no shit with us dog (x2)
We some killers in disguise
And if it comes that one is penalized and this is demised
Never been okay with livin' lies homie
So keep yo' head up to the sky homie
And pray that you never encounter my homies

[ClicKlak]
I treat the hood like the middle east
Pray to Allah hoping Christians deliver peace
Hangin' out the window chopper fully loaded
Got you lookin' to the sky prayin' to J Hova
Remember the last nigga i filled up
Still brah i really wish i would have killed ya
Logic cost'a sending bullets through the window
This that real life you just a pretender, a pretender
I write verse just to get by while going through pain
I move white like i'm bleach try'na get rid of stains
You move bricks in the trunk
I put mine in the planes
I'm talkin' all white clouds never seein' no rain
I'm a pimp til the day i go
Say pimpin three times baby there i go
(pimp, pimp, pimppp)
And the street sweeper will dust y'all
I swear to god you don't want no shit with us dog

[Chorus]
You don't want no shit with us dog (x2)
We some killers in disguise
And if it comes that one is penalized and this is demise
Never been okay with livin' lies homie
So keep yo' head up to the sky homie
And pray that you never encounter my homies
You don't want no shit with us dog (x3)
Never been okay with livin' lies homie
So keep yo' head to the sky homie
And pray that you never encounter my homies
