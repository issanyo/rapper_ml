[Verse 1]
Ay, I'm pouring four like the seasons
New face to the game but I'm well seasoned, yeah
How I just hit the mall
And I spent like twenty bands off at Neimans? Yeah
How I just check the mobile app
And I got half a million off at Regions? Yeah
And I'm crossing different regions, yeah
And I conquered all my demons, yeah
In my team, it's no treason
Hard working, but this shit coming easy
Bought the team iced Rollies
Just to show them motherfuckers my allegiance, yeah
And the bands never leavin', yeah
I gave 'em something to believe in, yeah
Dead presidents all inside my pocket
But nobody really grievin', yeah
Judge a man by who he pop for
We pushing weight but we are not sore
I made a hunnid thousand dollars yesterday
But this year I want a lot more
I'm fucking up my bitches contour
I'm on the Molly and the Tom Ford
Ironic 'cause they want the encore
I got the green like a lawn mower, yeah

[Hook]
Po' fo' like the seasons
How I just went, spent like fifty thousand off at Neimans?
And I check my bank account, got half a mil in Regions
In them different regions, and I'm super seasoned, yeah
And I just went, fucked me a bad bitch off at Four Seasons
How I just came in the game but I'm so super seasoned?
How is it that when you find yourself, you lose your demons?
And I'm off at Regions, in them different regions

[Verse 2]
Tell all of your homies kill that fuck shit
Boy, that pistol on my gut
Hey, wishful with they thinking
But that blissful in my cup
And your girl mouth got a dickful
But that bitch gon' turn it up
And my Indo burning up
Y'all wan' talk, don't earn enough
Hey, pulling up with the stick
And I pop the stick, I'm on the big bikes
Diamonds on me, call 'em "wrist slice"
Every song is like a big heist
We don't be with all that talking
Motherfucker, we the ones who really win fights
You need a button for the dislike
I got the Indo in my windpipes

[Hook]
Po' fo' like the seasons
How I just went, spent a car note off inside of Neimans?
How I check my bank account, got half a mil in Regions?
In them different regions, and I'm super seasoned
And I just went, fucked me a bad bitch off at Four Seasons
How I'm so new to the game but I'm so super seasoned?
How is it that when you find yourself, you lose your demons?
And I'm off at Regions, in them different regions
