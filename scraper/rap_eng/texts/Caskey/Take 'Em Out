[Verse 1]
Yes sir, guess who's back and black with no strings, in fact
A mink to match, my skin got so much ink attached
Drink from the glass, this preparation, my speakers blast
But let's get high like a 7.45 reefer sack
I breathe for that, 'bout to lose my mind, see a shrink for that
Mentally, get caught up in schemes, triple beams
Weighing decision, body check, see no injury
Prophesized stories claim I'll make it through changes throughout the century
Analysts is certain, fake shit could never enter me
Essentially, I'm just something these rappers ain't meant to be
Enter the open eyes, witness what I supply
Drought season on its way, I'm never running dry
Haters say what they want, I do what I desire
They like to fabricate, I say that they some lies
They say elaborate, I'm high, let me gravitate back down
Then I set it off, these bitches lame, boy, let it off

[Hook]
I see a lot of mouths running, what they talking 'bout?
Nothing, mane, super lame's what they all about
That's why I'm saying we should take 'em out
Lay 'em down, tell all these rappers here not to make a sound
Let's take 'em out (Bow!) boy, I say we take 'em out
Let's take 'em out (Bow!) boy, I say we take 'em out
Let's take 'em out (Bow!) boy, I say we take 'em out
Lay 'em down, tell all these rappers here not to make a sound

[Verse 2]
I tell 'em, "Step back, greatness just walked in"
And we be whilin', obsession to session but I'm survivin', boy
That radio, fucking depressin', how I be smiling's just a mystery
Box 'em in, wouldn't let them get to me
Too schizophrenic, multiple ways to get my chips replenished
And I got voices in my head saying, "Let's get it finished"
So beat the mission, I wonder why all these lames
Drop they song, think they gon' run this game, should run away
I'm a renegade, 2012, pussies been afraid
Life ain't gave me nothing but problems, made me lemonade
I sip it hard, wonder why these rappers never penetrate
The surface, got the experience of some virgins
I'm splurgin', indulge in that black magic of Merlin
For certain, something gotta change, this ain't workin'
Urgently I arrive, it's time to make it clear that all this fake shit
Need to step aside for some greatness, I let it off

[Hook]
I see a lot of mouths running, what they talking 'bout?
Nothing, mane, super lame's what they all about
That's why I'm saying we should take 'em out
Lay 'em down, tell all these rappers here not to make a sound
Let's take 'em out (Bow!) boy, I say we take 'em out
Let's take 'em out (Bow!) boy, I say we take 'em out
Let's take 'em out (Bow!) boy, I say we take 'em out
Lay 'em down, tell all these rappers here not to make a sound

[Verse 3]
Look, if I gotta result in violence, I'ma keep doing what I got to
I'm just prescribin' things that's necessary to all
Bless the very intelligent, curse all that irrelevance
Tell them fuck boys it's time to remain celibate
I'm hella bent, this swisher rolled, observing eyes
Wonder why these guys never see what's in they soul
I'm a vulture, this here a traffic jam
And our whole culture been stuck in a black Sedan
It's all going downhill, I'm staying down for the ride
Hope when that renters come, no one survive, open they eyes
We infatuated with this whole scene
Where these lame ass rappers the only ones making cream
It's so far from the dream, I swear, this the opposite of Inception
The more they try to direct, the more I lose my direction
Investing everything that I've got
But if they wanna up the ante, guess I'm taking this pot

[Outro]
It's that or I'ma take 'em out, let's take 'em out
Tell them fuck boys it's time to get out my house
Let's take 'em out, take 'em out
Tell them fuck boys it's time to get out my house
