[Intro: Yung Zae]
Came out to Cali, fucking with Cas
You already know what the fuck going on

[Chorus: Yung Zae]
Yeah, I came up and I did it
It's just something 'bout runnin' up them digits
Got narcotics with the money, I'm addicted
Countin' cage on the beat, boy, all my shit kickin'
Word around town, I got the juice
Doin' this shit, I don't need it
Yeah, I came up and I did it
Yeah, I came up and I did it

[Verse 1: Yung Zae]
Now I came up, bitch, I'm doin' shit
Know with Cas, first thing you do is throw a brick
Couple thousand in my chains, I ain't count my fit
Ask me 'bout my guala, I ain't never holdin' counterfeit
[?] attitude and we flex like ooh
Couple rockstars slidin' in the coupe
My back sticky, lil somethin' like glue
But my bitch snorted it 'til her face turned blue
Only thing I'm bringin' to the table hella strong
Bitch, I'm on, why your girl sendin' pictures in a thong
Aye, yeah, know she blow me like a bong
Yeah, hit the stu, pop out with a song
Yeah, yeah, I'm addicted to the money like percs
Do my money walk, shouts to Lil Durk
Ain't no second, boys, only on my first
Used to struggle, never worried 'bout the first 'cause I'm on, bitch

[Chorus: Yung Zae]
Yeah, I came up and I did it
It's just something 'bout runnin' up them digits
Got narcotics with the money, I'm addicted
Countin' cage on the beat, boy, all my shit kickin'
Word around town, I got the juice
Doin' this shit, I don't need it
Yeah, I came up and I did it
Yeah, I came up and I did it

[Verse 2: Caskey]
[?] same color Piccolo
And I love to pimp a bitch for her money, Deuce Bigalow
I had to hit her with the finger roll
I got a singer on my dick, but she really not a singer though
I gotta leave her out the bank with a duffle
I don't trust her, so I fuck her with a rubber
Shout out all you too high to rebuttal
I'm whippin' with the wrist while I fire up the butter
I'm pimpin' on my bitch while I slide with the [?]
And I'ma ride, I don't cuddle
They shootin' at my life 'cause they tried out my color
I'm rollin' 'round town superfly, never subtle
I'm takin' all streets to the sky, space shuttle
Take 'em to the sky, space shuttle
Fuck a bitch, I'ma ride for my brother
She try to leave the kid, I'ma find me another

[Chorus: Yung Zae]
Yeah, I came up and I did it
It's just something 'bout runnin' up them digits
Got narcotics with the money, I'm addicted
Countin' cage on the beat, boy, all my shit kickin'
Word around town, I got the juice
Doin' this shit, I don't need it
Yeah, I came up and I did it
Yeah, I came up and I did it
