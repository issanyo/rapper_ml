[Verse 1: Caskey]
Coming on 4 years since my father died
Sometimes I wish it was a homicide
Make the pain a lil' easier to understand
Self-inflicted wounds be the sins of man
Tens of grands flourish in my pockets on a regular now
And I'm like "word, I ain't smoking regular now"
Famous numbers all in my cellular now
Funny how the more respected I get
The more I'm in doubt with the self-loathing
Designer brand frequent on my belt and clothing
They see that as flashy
And I'm like...word
I see that as life's failed attempt to try and make me happy
When it seems like everything that I could guard just gon' attack me
I mean my heart got scars
My car ain't even starting
And I'm on my last dollar, man
I've been in the parking lot barred out, sipping the High Life
Contemplating taking my life
My vice has always been to try and mimic my father
And his decisions, but
Jobbin' like him just brought me them same collisions, I know
When I'm in these large crowds I get petrified
So excuse me if I step aside

[Hook 1: Caskey]
I always had a weak stomach
I puked last night
I was staring at the stars on the roof last night, aye
Man, I always had a weak stomach
I've been out here try to chill
The drama keep coming (Coming, coming)
Keep coming (Coming)
The drama keep coming (Coming, coming)
Man, I always had a weak stomach

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Yo, signing to a major label
Was always a fable, we didn't bank on it
Every table in my house got a drink on it
Alcoholic ambition to try to ease the pain
I ain't had no father figure to try and teach me, mane
Rolling 'round, 16 years old, on the way to Vero Beach
Reminiscing, that heat was under my seat, for what?
I guess I had something to prove
Problem child, ain't got nothing to lose, Vodka-induced
And I'm rolling 'til my shock has reduce to the bare minimal
On the borderline of being a criminal
Becoming a by-product all my homies with product for sale
In and out of jail and what it entail
"Hail Mary" inside the speaker while we bust the wide on Georgia Ave
Sitting in the back with a gat
Looking for them folk who robbed us last week, and we ain't sober
Then I told pimpin' to pullover

[Hook 2: Caskey & Machine Gun Kelly]
I always had a weak stomach
I puked last night
I was hanging out the window 'bout to shoot last night, aye
Man, I always had a weak stomach
I've been out here tryna chill
The drama keep coming (Coming, coming)
Keep coming (Coming)
Let some real muhfuckas speak
The drama keep coming (Coming, coming)
Shit, y'all know...Kells
Man, I always had a weak stomach

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
But fuck that
Ain't no time for a sickness when you trying to get it (Nah)
And all the time in this prison is spent finding a prism
A way to turn one ray of light into colorful visions
Carry on tradition for everyone who came from the ditches (Urghh)
Rose from the dirt without a stain though
Insane how some angels hang themselves with their own halo
That's why I lay low
Now my worst enemy is my mind
Stare at a screen and watch these other artists take what is mine
Sit by myself and smoke so much weed that it looks like I'm crying
This life offers a lot, but one thing it does not is rewind.
So I proceed forward
And my standards for this game never lowered
Ever since I became what they said I wouldn't I've wanted more
Dear Lord, save me from these snakes constricting like boas (Uh huh)
Old friends at my doors
Industry still ignore us
Landlord on the phone is telling me I can't afford it
I'm three months late
Feel like a pregnant woman this chorus
'Cause of my weak stomach

[Hook 3: Caskey]
I always had a weak stomach
I puked last night
I was contemplating telling you the truth last night, aye
Man, I always had a weak stomach
I've been out here try to chill
The drama keep coming (Coming, coming)
Keep coming (Coming)
The drama keep coming (Coming, coming)
Man, I always had a weak stomach
