[Hook]
(Black Sheep fucking 2)
Don't play with me
I be getting to it every day
I be in the streets every day
I been getting money every way
I just fucked that bitch every way

[Post-Hook]
Don't play with me
Just keep it G
Give all your haters the business
And then at the same time put on for your team
We come to lay down the law
Make 'em lay down for the cream
In love with myself
They can't fuck with my money or my self esteem

[Verse 1]
Don't play with me, I been getting money every way
I'm plotting on rappers, I'm thinking about this shit every day
That ain't your bitch if she flirting that mean that she fair play
We searching for Heaven but these days I can't find a stairway
Can't touch my team like we Hammer
Plus we got a hammer and been on our job
Every day I wake up and think 'bout that number one spot
'Cause we all 'bout defining the odds
I fucked a bitch at the tele and bust on her belly
She love me, she think I'm a god
I'm doing acid when I get to LA
I looked at my watch like that shit a facade
Tell them boys, don't play with me
The capital only thing okay to see
We put in overtime, that shit like foreplay to me
Ain't slept for like four days of the week
It seems like the more I'm advancing, the more they retreat
I'm back in the court with the heat, yeah
Heard that some rappers was talking my name
Just know when it comes to the beef

[Hook]
It's better to don't play with me
I be getting to it every day
I be in the streets every day
I been getting money every way
I just fucked that bitch every way

[Post-Hook]
Don't play with me
Just keep it G
Give all your haters the business
And then at the same time put on for your team
We come to lay down the law
Make 'em lay down for the cream
In love with myself
They can't fuck with my money or my self esteem

[Verse 2]
Come from the dirty, my shit way too clean
My partners winning, ain't no Charlie Sheen
I say, "Watch Netflix," she know what I mean
I gave her good dick, she turned to a fiend, yeah
No bitch, you ain't staying over
I'm back, never sober, let's both pop a bean
On Molly she fuck me like Lexi Duval
But on cough syrup both of us lean, it's all in my genes
I'm getting rich 'cause where I come from
People say being broke just not an option
Play if you want 'bout my money
But just know to proceed with caution
We flaunt so much 'round the city
That this is starting to get obnoxious
The mayor just called me
Said, "Cas, can you turn down a couple of notches?"
Pop one and forget I'm conscious
I got too high and I cussed out my sponsors
Only time I feel at home is in concerts
So I'm on tour and perform like a monster
Speaking of Monster, they used to be cutting the check
I fucked up the deal and they stopped
Needless to say, I'm done endorsing shit I don't drink
And I ain't selling out to be pop

[Hook]
So tell them boys, don't play with me
I be getting to it every day
I be in the streets every day
I been getting money every way
I just fucked that bitch every way

[Post-Hook]
Don't play with me
Just keep it G
