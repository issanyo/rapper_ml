Why you throwing stones at my glass house?
I really started from the mud, I'm the man now
No, I'm not flexing when I say I'm having cash now
He said I couldn't do it, now that boy a fan now
So why you throwing stones at my glass house?
Why you throwing stones at my glass house?
Why you throwing stones at my glass house?
Why you throwing stones at my glass house?

[Verse 1: Coca Vango]
What type of nigga would I be if I flexed on you?
If I really wanted to, I'd blow a check on you
You peel off talking like a bitch, that mean you bitch made
You ain't never had no cash, but yo' bitch paid
What type of shit that is? You reapin' benefits
Let's just be honest, nigga, you know I'm really rich
I do the shit you wanna do, on the daily
Yo' baby mama say she wanna have my baby
I'm really popping, like the crack in the 80s
That's why yo' sister and yo' mama wanna date me
Nobody wouldn't know if you just shut your mouth
You should've never threw no stones at my glass house

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Ok, why you throwing stones in my glass house?
Yo' bitch sucked my dick inside the trap house
And she give me good head, I can't bad mouth
I really do this shit that y'all just rap 'bout
I got twenty grams inside the swisher, whoa
On the porch, selling dimes and nickels, whoa
My pockets like my bitches, yeah, they getting thicker
All your home boys, they gon' switch
After you fail on your goals, that's the kicker
Ok, you can the groupie hoes that flock at the shows now
Got yo' baby mama in my DM where it goes down
Heard the hood you repping and it's really just a ghost town
Pimpin', I ain't got no tinted windows in my Ghost now
