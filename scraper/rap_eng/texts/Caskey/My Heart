[Intro]
I tried to warn you

[Hook]
Don't play, don't play
Don't play with my heart
Don't play, don't play
Don't play with my heart
Don't play, don't play
Don't play with my heart
Don't play, don't play
Don't play with my heart

[Verse 1]
I've been going through some things
My bitch left me in the open
I've been going through some things
You don't know the half of it, I'm holdin' it
I don't where I begin
I just roll me a blunt, I'ma sin
When I pop a pill, I'm feeling fine
I think something wrong with my state of mind
Yeah, please don't play with my heart, I'm fragile
Yeah, fucking women I don't care about, ooh, it's a battle

[Hook]
Don't play, don't play
Don't play with my heart
Don't play, don't play
Don't play with my heart

[Verse 2]
I don't celebrate nothin'
My bitch left me on my birthday
I went and popped a 2-pack
Shit hit me in the worst way
Drunk once again
Inside of the club tryin' to find love
Yeah, hate to play it in my head
But I wish I could rewind us
Don't play
Don't play with my heart, I got demons
Thinking you the one that's gonna change it, girl you dreamin'
I made myself in love with money, money never leavin'
Don't fuckin' play
I ain't someone that you wanna get lost in
I got head problems fucking with me it's exhaustin'

[Hook]
Don't play, don't play
Don't play with my heart
Don't play, don't play
Don't play with my heart

[Verse 3]
I've been going through some things
I don't know if y'all can see it
I've been going through some things
I popped off [?] leave it
Tell 'em I'm going through some things
'Cause I've been going through some bad things
I just popped me some Xans, yeah, ugh
I'm spending nights it's these Percocets
You a rich girl but you left me in a debt
I ain't got a prob 'bout it, I just got away
I'm out here tryna send my heart away, I'm in a jet
I'm flying overseas, how you find love when the fees
For your show alone enough to make 'em freeze
These bitches only want you 'cause they see you on the Ts
How a girl like that supposed to take care of your needs?
Yeah, the girl I love, she went to Asia
That shit turned me to a player
Maybe one day I'ma change her
Probably not, so it's best you don't play

[Hook]
Don't play, don't play
Don't play with my heart
Don't play, don't play
Don't play with my heart

[Outro]
I've been going through some things
