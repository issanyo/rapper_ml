[Intro: ClicKlak & Escabear]
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, yes, sir
Now introducing (preach!) two of the rawest pimps to ever bless the mic (yes, sir)
Must I say, this is some psychological pimpin' from the FLA, yes, sir
And I'm eighty years old and I pimp hoes, bitch

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Hopped up out my room oh it's saturday, police took my gat away
Plus my uncle passed away, don't know why I'm back today
Ash away, ash away, roll another, ash the J
Aston Martins out my reach, leeches bring me cash delayed
Ayy, I exit the front do', bike myself up to the sto'
Got me a swisher for dro, saw this hoe
Oh my God, this bitch got her own facade
Obvious she had a job, still I knew not where to start
Slowly I approached, tryna coax her heart
Said I had no game, she would play me like a poker card
Damn, she ain't even lie
Tryna see these dollar signs, I need to meet the supplier
That's when this OG, stepped from the corner sto'
With a look in his eyes that told me champagne overload
Opened the do' to his Cadillac, looked me in my eye
And must've seen there was somethin' inside

[Chorus: Caskey & ClicKlak]
Said, "let me show you what a pimp is"
Shit, what you mean?
Show you what a pimp is
Buy what I want
Ride what I want and get high when I want
What a pimp is
That's exactly what a pimp is, I do what the fuck I want
Said, "let me show you what a pimp is"
Show you what a pimp is

[Verse 2: ClicKlak]
Take a look at a pimp, I got bitches on deck
Put a hoe in line if she ever disrespect
Bishop Don diamond trim
Follow my mojo, get behind a pimp
In places you won't go, make you blind from sin
Where bitches seduce the weak, simple minds of men
And bring me the currency, I disperse with them
Show me haste and urgency or I'm hurtin' them
I was told to control and mold
A hoe to get in condition to be sold for dough
Impede off her self-esteem
Break 'em down, build 'em up, make 'em join my team
If you knew what I seen, you might be ashamed
Been 'round pimps, puttin' heroin into veins
To lock her into the game, the underworld get insane
Corrupted, forever changed, I showed you that I'm a pimp

[Chorus: Caskey & ClicKlak]
Let me show you what a pimp is
Yeah, motherfucker, let me show you what a pimp is
That's when you buy what you want
Ride when you want, get high when you want
So let me show you what a pimp is
Buy what I want
Ride what I want, get high when I want
Let me show you what a pimp is
That's when I buy what I want
Ride what I want and get high when I want, yeah, okay

[Verse 3: Caskey & ClicKlak]
Been here befo', fast-forward a year later
Both have seen our ups and our downs, got gators
Dropped bitches in other states, got cake
And if you trickin', dog, you cannot relate, you are bait
And I'm the fishing pole, lookin' for a better hole
Told her, "I'ma try to fit you up into my schedule"
She said, "I hope you do," I said, "I know I will"
And after that we bend some corners, make a couple deals
A couple deals make a couple meals
If the moves are correct, it'll make a couple mill
But the bitch gotta be bad
And she gotta get a man hotter than the heat pad
Yeah, and control alt delete that
Gettin' brains while I'm drivin' with the seat back
Girl, you know I like it
Swaggin' in this bitch, I know it get you excited
And that money get us divided
So we gon' multiply in silence
And this is where it gotta get serious
You don't come up to [?] period
Point blank, silly bitch, I'm tryna get really rich
You could keep them smart hoes, I want a sadiddy bitch
That way I can break her mind and break her pockets
Red light shawty, they askin' me just to stop it

[Outro: Caskey]
Yeah, but I could never stop it, bitch
Pimps in the motherfuckin' buildin', hoe
