[Intro: Caskey]
Yeah, but this that homegrown
This that homegrown, that mean that it's time
That mean that it's time, yeah
Yeah, I work inside my home, damn it, I've been plotting this
Once I come get on, ain't nobody gon' be stopping this
All my homies copping this, interstate worker, yo metropolis
Grab the baddest bitch and come to rock with this

[Hook: Caskey]
Yo, but this that homegrown
That mean that it's time for germination
The opposition out here patient, waitin'
But they ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Damn, tryna stop my shine
Yo, but this that homegrown
That mean that it's time for germination
The opposition out here patient, waitin'
But they ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Damn, tryna stop my shine

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Look, coming up, these haters see that
Speculate yo' grind and see you shining, can't believe that
I'm going through this stage, center stage, but do I need that?
Caught up on this mission, but this homegrown indo got me feeling superstitious
I seen too many black cats, wishes with these nine lives
Haters tryna take mine, heard it through the grapevine
Crossing interstate lines, fuck you bitches talking 'bout?
Never had a racing time, momma told me chalk 'em out
Running through this complicated economic time
Contemplating ways, patient with this chronic on my mind
But I ain't got a lot of time, this a race and my running skills is amazin'
But these papers got my feet up off the pavement like, "What the fuck we blazin'?"
Huh, ay, this shit is amazin'
What the fuck we blazin'? Feet up off the pavement
Damn, what the fuck we blazin'?

[Hook: Caskey]
Yo, but this that homegrown
That mean that it's time for germination
The opposition out here patient, waitin'
But they ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Damn, tryna stop my shine
Yo, but this that homegrown
That mean that it's time for germination
The opposition out here patient, waitin'
But they ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Damn, tryna stop my shine

[Verse 2: Caskey]
I got the plants inside my living room, tell me what you know about it
I be in the atmosphere, kush clouded, body like cushions around it
They say that my drive, my push is astoundin'
Play the game intelligent, bisect and [?] surroundin's
Me and DKuhl [?] and connecting these elements, earth and fire
These purple leaves feeling like Hercules, my desire's
For real, not to work with these liars, I kept my circle tight
Grab my phone to re-up, gotta ask him what the work is like

[Verse 3: DKuhl]
Yo, Cask, it's homegrown, I ain't on it, but I'm faded
So kids, cover your ears 'cause this shit is X-rated
We can't be impersonated, so don't try and be us
You can't see us, the only chance for you lames is to re-up
And we still be super gone (Super gone)
And it ain't hard to tell I'm in my zone
So we keep stacking this paper, getting dome from your girlfriend
She left a kid blown, saying that the world spins, world spin

[Hook: Caskey]
Yo, but this that homegrown
That mean that it's time for germination
The opposition out here patient, waitin'
But they ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Damn, tryna stop my shine
Yo, but this that homegrown
That mean that it's time for germination
The opposition out here patient, waitin'
But they ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Ain't gon' take mine
Damn, tryna stop my shine

[Outro: Caskey]
What the fuck they say they doing, homie?
Making these wrong moves
What's that, kush and orange juice?
I got purp and Arizona
Connects from here to California
Growing that homegrown marijuana, ay
Ay, yeah, I stay smoking that homegrown
Ay, yeah, I stay smoking that homegrown
What the fuck they think they doing, homie?
Bitch, yeah, 'cause this that homegrown
That mean that it's time, yeah
