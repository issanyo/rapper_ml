[Intro]
Yeah, I'm on my way

[Chorus]
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)

[Verse 1]
Just say the word, do you want it with me?
You give me one shot, it's everything you want it to be
'cause I've been watchin' from afar, I know it's somethin' to see
You've got a lot of people chasin' you, it's nothin' to me
I can't deny it, you've been drivin' me crazy
I wanna pour up with you, girl, and make you my baby
I see yo' demons callin' you, that shit on the daily
We all got us some issues though that shit never faze me
I'm ridin' with the strap out, wanna bring you to a bad house
Treat you like a good girl, hit you 'til you tap out
Have you ever seen the world? Let's get it mapped out
All you gotta do is say the word to me

[Chorus]
And I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
Yeah, I'm on my way, I'm on my way (I'll be on my way)
Yeah, I'm on my way, I'm on my way (I'll be on my way)

[Verse 2]
Do you want it with me?
Just say the word, I'll make it everything you want it to be
I know you seein' me from far away, it's somethin' to see
I know some people chasin' on you but that's nothin' to me
You got that dope shit, fuck talkin' 'bout it, girl, let's put it into motion
When I'm high with you, I feel like I don't need a potion
Rubbin' on your body, it's a feelin', it's emotion
This hole, that hole, everything is soakin'
When I'm in your body, feel like I'm inside the ocean
Cannot be the only reason that you got the focus
She said, "can u b here in 30?"
I asked her "y", she sent a picture, it was dirty, "ok"

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on my way, I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)
And I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'm on my way, I'm on my way)

[Bridge]
When I pull up, please don't have any clothes on
I've been thinkin' 'bout this shit for so long
If I told you what I'm 'bout to do, you'd say it's so wrong
I'ma whip it out, don't say a word, girl, just go on
Get it on yo' couch, eat yo' pussy 'til it's drippin' out my mouth
I'm a nasty motherfucker, do it all around the house
I just hit it on the bed spread, now it's double
Your pussy lips were talkin' crazy, now you in trouble

[Outro]
You in trouble
I'ma pull up at your house and do it like no other (Rich girl)
I wanna do R. Kelly dirty shit to you, baby
I wanna lick your body so much, to your fuckin' legs
Chokin' on your fuckin' legs (I'll be on my way)
Makin' it hard to breathe and shit, I want you (Rich girl)
Scratchin' my fuckin' body
Chokin' on my fuckin' dick 'til you can't fuckin' breathe
Baby, I want you
