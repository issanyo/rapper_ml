[Pre-Chorus: Caskey]
I can't trust a bitch, that's all I know (woo)
If she love me, she got to let go (woo)
Chasin' after paper all I know (woo) yeah
All my partners with me, trained to go (woo)

[Chorus: Caskey]
I'm like fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it
I'm like fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it
K, I'm mixin' the fluid, I'm juggin' into it
I'm like fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it, yeah

[Verse 1: Caskey]
I don't do shit for clout, I'm swervin' out my car, it's burnin' out
Freak hoes at the 'vent and turnin' out and that's all word of mouth
I popped off one more time, I swore I was gon' stop, I'm lyin' now
They be stupid, try and take my check, they gon' be lyin' down
Don't give out no free publicity, I turn the crib into antiquity
They all say sad and misery, I don't let none of it get to me
I got a problem (what's that?) I'm rich, but I'm boujee
Still eatin' ramen, yeah, on some EMT, feel like a shaman
Feelin' bold with my slime, that my snail
If the police come in, we 'bout shit, no details
Yeah, my bitch bad as hell, coke on her fingernail
Live my life like rockstar, [?] that I love to tell

[Pre-Chorus: Caskey]
I can't trust a bitch, that's all I know (woo) yeah
If she love me, she just got to let go (woo)
Chasin' after paper all I know (woo) yeah
All my partners with me, trained to go (woo)

[Bridge: Father Lucas]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa, yeah
Shorty wanna get the gold, yeah
Hit the 'rari then I go, oh yeah
Everybody wanna know, yah

[Verse 2: Father Lucas]
How the fuck did Father Lucas come up with these bitches?
I make the benjis, you know I get the riches (oh I)
Keep on climbing, these bitches acting whiny
And you know that I'm runnin' to the money (yeah)
Yeah, I'm paid, walkin' white on me, yeah
Oh my, oh my, oh me, yeah
VV, bad bitches on me, yeah
Oh my, hand me glocky, yeah, ooh

[Chorus: Father Lucas]
Fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it, yeah
Fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it, yeah
Fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it, yeah
Fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it, ayy!

[Chorus: Caskey & Father Lucas]
Fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it
I'm like fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it
K, I'm mixin' the fluid, I'm juggin' into it
I'm like fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it, yeah
I'm like fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it
I'm like fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it
K, I'm mixin' the fluid, I'm juggin' into it
I'm like fuck it, let's do it, fuck it, let's do it, yeah
