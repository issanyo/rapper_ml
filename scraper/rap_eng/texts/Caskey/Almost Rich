[Chorus: Caskey]
Hoe, shut the fuck up
If you ain't gon' ride for me, then jump off my dick
You know this ain't free, please check out the crib
This gon' how it be, yeah, almost rich
Yeah, almost rich, ayy, yeah, almost rich

[Verse 1: Caskey]
K, I met this bad lil shorty off at Rolling Loud, ayy
See my jewelry, say she wanna fuck me now, ayy
Pinky ring look like I just came out the stars, ayy
Thumbin' through that check, it's like I'm countin' cards
Can't count on nobody but yourself, but it's all Gucci like the belt
I gotta play with the cards I'm dealt, I'm in the studio nowhere else
They see my motivation high, I never settle for gettin' by
I want a million by 25, that's why she want me to come inside, ayy
Whoa (woop), fuck me on the table if it's real
Ayy (woop), once you get this pipe, I'm the man of steel
Ayy (woop), let's spend all our money then go make a mill
Just bought actavis (ayy), let's go crack a seal

[Chorus: Caskey & ClicKlak]
If you ain't gon' ride for me, ayy, then jump off my dick (yeah)
You know this ain't free (yeah), ayy, just checked out the crib
This gon' how it be (Pimp), ayy, yeah, almost rich (whoa)
Ayy, almost rich (yeah), ayy, almost rich (huh)

[Verse 2: ClicKlak]
Hit her with a dummy brick, almost fished
He tried to run it back, almost blitzed
I heard yo' mixtape, you had some almost hits
You got some catchin' up to do, 'cause I'm almost rich
Number one prospect, [?] it's really no contest
[?] complex, hittin' a lick with your life is the projects
Part of my process, now I get paid 'cause your girl gettin' topless
You movin' keys? How you end up in jail and you ain't got a locksmith?
I just turned a trick out of EDC
If you buyin' pussy, then come shop with me
I'm a life coach, I pimp responsibly
I got strippers 'round the world wanna sponsor me (hey!)

[Outro: Caskey]
Almost rich, ayy, whoa
Almost rich, ayy, yeah, oh
Almost rich, yeah, ayy, whoa
Almost rich, yeah
