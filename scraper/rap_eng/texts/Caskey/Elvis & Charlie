[Intro]
When I'm in my Elvis mood
I'm in a good mood
I'm getting plastered
Ripped out the frame
And I'm singing having a good time for everybody
And letting the good times roll
And everybody's happy, and everybody loves it
When i see you laugh it makes me happy
And when I am mad i feel like i am Charles Manson
(Tetete) I can't stop killing


[Hook]
What's up lil homie?
On my double cup shit
You know how i pack 'em
Make ya partner double up quick
That's the shit i be on
Been sippin' that neon
Styrofoam, movin' slow
I've been here for an eon

[Verse 1]
Well there's a rapping at my door
Boy I'm on my Deon
While i been readin' Edgar Allan
Y'all been snortin' Freon
Watch me turn the key on
It's 'bout time i dropped this here
Every time i get management
They swear to me that I'm gonna pop this year
Well fuck 'em all
Strapped up i got two knives
I'm gonna cut them all
Take both of they wives home
Dick 'em down and then fuck them raw
This is not for the kind-hearted
My shit, it is quite retarded
You suspect to gettin' blind sided
We suspects, we don't crime fight
We just cut checks when the times right
Try'na be the next Lex Luthor
Find myself a new young jit
Who could possibly be my next shooter
Find myself a new gun smith with a low price
And a dumb bitch who is so trife, and got no life
And do the opposite of that nun shit
See the whole lane of jokers die with just one clip
And the whole game of poker rely on one chip
And a bad bluff
And one slips
See the man tough
They often disguisin' they pussy
Therefore they act up
See even when my life was new to the game
I wasn't with rookies
My affiliation was slangin' them cookies
And you wasn't hangin'
You hang with the Snooki's
What i did for money
You did for the nookie
So when they were lookin' for someone to pull it together
They call me for bookin'
Ha, shit you would get called in for lookin'
My team is crooked
But whenever liquor involved in the movement i turn into

[Chorus]
Elvis Presley, Charles Manson
It's devilish as the devil, lord is harmless dancin'
Must been a gemini inside me crept in
Cause this alcohol it turn me to a Charles Manson
Elvis Presley, Charles Manson
Either the life of this party
Or I'm gonna sink my hands in blood
Must been a gemini inside me crept in
Cause this alcohol it turn me to a Charles Manson

[Verse 2]
Charlie come out and play
Have some more Alize
Alcohol, alchemist
Power plays, calculus
Unable to be performed
But we can snort a coke line off a Jesus thorn
And light up the opiates
Let the demons perform
I come to speak to a man
The second he leakin' the floor
This is the storm, kamikaze
I wonder who could be godly
In a world so dominated by sin
And thin hotties with rims
Tell 'em in, if you got it
See i ain't Irv Gotti
But that murder incoporate me
My nerves rottin'
I love when they light up the herb plottin'
It's like watching a child come to fruition

Shit, it's like who do i trust
This Jackie B or this Christian inside me

Well he is probably lyin'
You should trust what you sippin'
The alcohol ain't ever steered you wrong

Except i know different
That is until the liquor get persuading me to play with DNA
Turn me into a

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Life of the party
Whats a life without Bacardi and a shot of Hennessy
Fuck all of my enemies alarmin'
How this here it could bring the best of me
It could bring the worst to be
Could just be a curse to me
And my temper bad
So you might just take that personally
Man i got that person on me
And i come to vibe so whenever i ride
I got that mercy on me
But yo that alcohol known to leave that out the door
Might just bring the devil out me
Might just leave me out control
And i do not suppose y'all heard about Jackal and Hyde
But whenever that bastard arrive
He got a devilish smile
And they say he got my eyes
And they say he tell all my lies
See one drink you talkin' to Elvis
And then the next you could die
