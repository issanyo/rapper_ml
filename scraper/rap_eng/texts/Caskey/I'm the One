[Hook]
I'm the one
I'm the one who got the bitches in the club poppin' off
I'm the one who got the gangsters in the corner noddin' off
I'm the one who got him back up on the drugs again
I'm the one, you shouldn't fuck with him, nah, I'm the one

[Post-Hook]
I'm the one they wanna see in the city (I'm the one)
I'm the one who got the keys to the city (I'm the one)
I'm the one who got the bitches blowin' up the line
Even when I got the number nine, dog, I'm the one

[Hook]
I'm the one who got the bitches in the club poppin' off
I'm the one who got the gangsters in the corner noddin' off
I'm the one who got him back up on the drugs again
I'm the one, you shouldn't fuck with him, nah, I'm the one

[Verse 1]
I'm the one who got the city on lock, I'm the one
Twenty thousand grams I just copped, I'm the one
All around the nation with the sold out shows
Came back stuntin' just to drop it on you hoes
Switched the hustle 'cause the money is the power
Business after business 'cause I'm on one every hour
In the club, mixing Moon Rocks with the sour
Only rock designer shit, don't touch no Eddie Bauer
Fuck too many hoes, I think I turned to Austin Powers
Ridin' around with choppas on my lap like, "Fuck you cowards"
Like the work getting cooked, this the dope spot
Got a fast talking bitch giving slow top

[Hook]
I'm the one
I'm the one who got the bitches in the club poppin' off
I'm the one who got the gangsters in the corner noddin' off
I'm the one who got him back up on the drugs again
I'm the one, you shouldn't fuck with him, nah, I'm the one

[Post-Hook]
I'm the one they wanna see in the city (I'm the one)
I'm the one who got the keys to the city (I'm the one)
I'm the one who got the bitches blowin' up the line
Even when I got the number nine, dog, I'm the one

[Verse 2]
I'm the one, I'm the one they got to talk about
I'm the one, I'm the reason that this spotless
All my older bitches call me, when I fuck her, call her vintage
I'm so close to her pockets feel like I was fourth in inches
I'm standing on a couch throwin' money, that's the business
I'm sinnin' every night and in the morning ask forgiveness
Six bitches with me, like the motel
Might just move to Vegas (Why?) 'cause these hoes tell
These hoes will drive you crazy, please don't believe 'em
Just bring the dollars out 'cause we gonna need 'em
They talking crazy 'bout me, we gonna see 'em
When I pull up, I go Jumpman, M23 'em, I'm the mothafuckin' one

[Hook]
I'm the one
I'm the one who got the bitches in the club poppin' off
I'm the one who got the gangsters in the corner noddin' off
I'm the one who got him back up on the drugs again
I'm the one, you shouldn't fuck with him, nah, I'm the one

[Post-Hook]
I'm the one they wanna see in the city (I'm the one)
