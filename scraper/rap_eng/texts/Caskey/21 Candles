[Hook: Soule Caponé]
Got angels at every angle, darkness got my star spangled
I'm lit like 21 candles, picture me a star
Now put that on your mental as I spit fire
I'm the devil, just upgraded, next level
Got angels at every angle, darkness got my star spangled
I'm lit like 21 candles, picture me a star
Now put that on your mental as I spit fire
I'm the devil, just upgraded, next level
Got angels at every angle, darkness got my star spangled
I'm lit like 21 candles, picture me a star
Now put that on your mental as I spit fire
I'm the devil, just upgraded, next level
I'm lit like 21 candles

[Verse 1: Soule Caponé]
Bow my head to the darkness
Without it the world would be artless
Keeping all my drugs stashed in a tabernackle
Stay getting high with the mobsters, inhale, exhale
My gospel weed back, repping triple black and we unlawful
Looks can kill, but [?] so trill
So understand me, real recognize real, this the shit they gon' feel
Loyalty before royalty
All for the poetry, heretic warrior still clutching on his rosary
May God someday quote me
Until then, may our lives live forever in luxury
'cause all I know is Heaven out this purgatory
Until then, I'm gonna have the baddest bitch in the sorority
And twin 45s always on duty
This lifestyle ain't nothing new to me, stop the foolery
Or you'll be dealt cruelly, and this is spoken from yours truly
Soule, baby

[Hook: Soule Caponé]
Got angels at every angle, darkness got my star spangled
I'm lit like 21 candles, picture me a star
Now put that on your mental as I spit fire
I'm the devil, just upgraded, next level
Got angels at every angle, darkness got my star spangled
I'm lit like 21 candles, picture me a star
Now put that on your mental as I spit fire
I'm the devil, just upgraded, next level
Got angels at every angle, darkness got my star spangled
I'm lit like 21 candles, picture me a star
Now put that on your mental as I spit fire
I'm the devil, just upgraded, next level
I'm lit like 21 candles

[Verse 2: Caskey]
I told God that no need to sentence me
This life is hell, I'm in the house of the enemy
I gotta cleanse all my energy
Gather all my demons, make an assembly
I sip out the 40 ounce like it was holy water
Dog, but this not a remedy
I ain't going out like Kennedy
One shot and that's how they remember me
Never stop for the [?] me
Attorney hit me for a lawsuit
I said, "It's cool, pay the money
Let karma get 'em, nobody God-proof"
There ain't no stopping what's divine
Split the money, duplicate how I grind
Send the paperwork, I know where to sign
Make it back again before I resign
I'll never stop, never slow down, never fear what's behind me
I run through the city, nobody guards knowing that it's grimy
I keep a fo'-five sitting on my lap, dare someone try me
Police lights tryna blind me, in the bible pages where they could find me
At the altar where I licked that punani, I'm a legend in the universe
A mentor, but for the love of money and my family I'll do the worst
I got no time for reclinin', I been intelligent, designin'
I bend the shape of the universe to my will, like origami
Lil bitch
