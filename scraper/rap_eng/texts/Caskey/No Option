[Intro: Caskey]
Yeah, you know, it's like
Once you get the first flooded Rollie day-date on your hand
It's like, you never wanna see your wrist without that shit
Young Cas, Chad The Pilot

[Hook: Chad The Pilot]
Going broke, that ain't no option, and this team, ain't no stoppin'
Buying dreams when we go shoppin', if we like it then we coppin'
Going broke, that ain't no option, and this team, ain't no stoppin'
Buying dreams when we go shoppin', if we like it then we coppin'

[Verse 1: Chad The Pilot]
Went from trapping in the deep end, hit the studio and
Made the world hone in, to all the shit I'm holdin'
Hit the trap house, dog, I'm back on deck
Pushing hella weight, I said I'm back on flex
Got no love for these hoes 'cause they just want the money
And I just want the sex, if you see I'm up top
Let 'em know I'm coming next, boy, I'm flying to the money
And that ticket a one way, knew it'd happen one day

[Bridge: Chad The Pilot]
They said I been, I been losing my mind lately
And, I been feeling crazy
It's crazy how I feel, I feel this shit comin'
And I'm on hella drugs, so I shouldn't feel nothin'

[Hook: Chad The Pilot]
Going broke, that ain't no option, and this team, ain't no stoppin'
Buying dreams when we go shoppin', if we like it then we coppin'
Going broke, that ain't no option, and this team, ain't no stoppin'
Buying dreams when we go shoppin', if we like it then we coppin'

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Damn, came from pitching grams
How I started broke, but just caught three hunnid grand?
Hide in so much smoke, I could barely see my hands
How I'm in yo' bitch's throat, oh yeah, that's the plan
I pull up in a rental Jag, throwing crispy hunnids out the roof
Yeah, my circle small, pussy, you just outside of the loop
I got gold chains, gold Rollies, gold all on my tooth
And you throwed, plus you breaking code, that shit not the truth
I got hoes and I'm breaking hoes inside of the coupe
I get money eighteen hunnid ways and you just bound to two
In the kitchen, mixing up the drugs, no, this isn't soup
Yeah, we stack it to the ceiling, put it inside of the roof, skrt

[Hook: Chad The Pilot]
Going broke, that ain't no option, and this team, ain't no stoppin'
Buying dreams when we go shoppin', if we like it then we coppin'
Going broke, that ain't no option, and this team, ain't no stoppin'
Buying dreams when we go shoppin', if we like it then we coppin'

[Verse 3: Chad The Pilot]
Straight gas with no brakin', they must've mistaken
These bars for medication, I'm taking over, three points
Said this here domination, they ain't letting me through
So everything they got, well, I'm getting it too
Until I'm getting it too, a Rolls Royce Phantom
Looking way better than you, do it real, real big
With like whatever we do, we been creeping on the low
Fucked around and came up, crazy we ain't even know
