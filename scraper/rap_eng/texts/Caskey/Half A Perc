[Hook: Wifisfuneral]
Half a perc up in my system
Just for some motivation
I ride on dubs, box Chevys
And get that foreign to race 'em
Okay, I flex too much, it's quite obscene
Two bitches, siamese
They kick it, join my soccer team
I'm off that bean like, "Fuck you mean?"

[Bridge: Wifisfuneral]
I'm on that bean, ay
I'm off that bean, ay
I'm on that bean, ay, ay
I'm on that bean, ay, yeah, ay

[Verse 1: Wifisfuneral]
I just pulled up in that foreign
Two door coupe, ay, with that top back
They counting so much racks up in my hands
So they tryna catch me up, up in a mousetrap
Been flexing and finessing too damn hard, they be like
"Lil Ric Flair, you need to stop that", but I copped that
Red dropped up in my Faygos
So I had to mix the Tech, I must've sold him that
Yeah, I called my banker up and get some racks
And then I blow it, damn
Like we be lurking state-to-state
Just to make some plays and bring the racks again
Bad bitch for my preference
Said her name Mercedes, so I ride the bitch
Test drive the bitch off a whole perc and a lot of sticks
But I bet you can't do it like me
Flex so hard with the racks and the cheese
Six K on my waist, them's Saint Laurent jeans

[Verse 2: Caskey, both]
Six K on my waist, them's Saint Laurent jeans, God damn
Do I need change for the cheese? No, mam
Just pulled up in a drop top, vroom
Then I took her back home, hit her to a slow jam, God damn
Percs got me feeling motivated
Seen the Rollie, man, you know we made it
All my shit is looking orchestrated
All my bitches always sort of faded
Got a freak bitch who's giving top
I been killing pussy, ain't a lie
I remember back in the days
Back when I barely, rarely heard to stop
Back when I made my money off of pot and the bitches
Got my hoes making odd calls
I done really been with the shits
I don't really know about y'all
All I know is that I got a bar
I'm a wizard, boy, John Wall
Got all my bitches on call
Got the pussy wanting encores
Killing it slowly
She just sucked my dick and she don't even know me
I'm balling like Kobe's
I poured a lil liquor out for the homies

[Hook: Wifisfuneral]
Half a perc up in my system
Just for some motivation
I ride on dubs, box Chevys
And get that foreign to race 'em
Okay, I flex too much, it's quite obscene
Two bitches, siamese
They kick it, join my soccer team
I'm off that bean like, "Fuck you mean?"

[Outro: Wifisfuneral]
Yeah, okay, I'm off that bean like, "Fuck you mean?"
Ay, okay, I'm off that bean like, "Fuck you mean?"
Yeah, okay, I'm off that bean like, "Fuck you mean?"
Yeah, yeah, ay, I'm off that bean like, "Fuck you mean?"
