Floating in the sky, I get so damn high
All jokes aside, I think I'm on the rise
Look me in the eyes, you see that I'm alive
Floating in the sky

[Verse 1: John Wicks]
I will never land, smoking cannabis
Watch me do my dance, let me elevate
Who that is? Lil Scott, call him "c'est la vie" (Mister)

Shorty ask I'ma stop this shit, I don't know if I'm able
Chopping the work on the counter, put it thru the money counter
Ay, homie ask if I want a hit of white, said, "I only do downers"
This don't taste like lean, whoa, homie tried to serve me Hi-Tech

Man, I'm hard for them to digest, my homie got it out the Pyrex
I'm from the [?] of the projects, either way they hate the progress
I'm smoked up 24/7, roll up a quarter pound
My bitch and the plug from Tijuana, I'm at the border now
I'm 24 with a 38 on me, I just bought 40 pounds
In a new chopper, wanna see how this shorty sounds
Every time I'm in the town, I'm...
