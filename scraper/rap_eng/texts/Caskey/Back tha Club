[Intro]
Counting money and shit
Counting money, all this brand new shit
In the back the club

[Hook]
Ay, all my bitches stacking up, in the back the club
Fill the plastic bag, can you stack enough?
Throw the ones, throw the tens, throw a stack of dubs
She ain't tryin' to fuck, she just clap it up
Yeah, whoa, in the back the club
Fill the plastic bag, can you stack it up?
Throw the ones, throw the tens, throw a stack of dubs
She ain't tryin' to fuck, just want money up

[Verse 1]
All my bitches stack money, call your daddy
But you know this ain't her dad money
You all off inside the corner acting mad funny (Strange)
She gon' pass the ball before, now she gon' pass it to me, yeah
She gon' hit the stage, she gon' twerk it for some big faces
Y'all amazed, we came up, bought us six cases (Really balling)
We throwing scholarships, her ass is super tatted
You know a lot of girls, but you gotta have it
First time that she hit the stage, pulled up in the Caddy (Skrrt!)
Skrrt off in that Lexus, damn, girl, you know you're savvy
Forgot her name 'cause now everybody call her "Baddy"
Girl, you know you're savage, she got expensive habits

[Hook]
Yeah, all my bitches stacking up, in the back the club
Fill the plastic bag, can you stack enough?
Throw the ones, throw the tens, throw a stack of dubs
She ain't tryin' to fuck, she just want money up
Whoa, yeah, in the back the club
Plastic bag, stacking up
Throw the ones, throw the tens, throw a stack of dubs
She ain't tryin' to fuck, she just want money up

[Verse 2]
She gon' hit the strip, leave the telly by herself (Damn)
Gotta catch a flight when you're really chasing wealth (Plane)
In a different city every night, this how she felt (Whoa)
Alexander Wang, shit, what kind of cards you're dealt?
Looking for the ballers, man, I heard that he a wild
She been working two nights, she just made like thirty thou'
Came back home, it look like she the richest bitch in town
You the trap star but you're broke and juggin' pounds
And she got her money up
She got them bands, baby, y'all ain't even done enough
She roll up the honey dutch, everybody wanna touch
She count it and run it up, she count it and run it up

[Hook]
All my bitches stacking up, in the back the club
Get the plastic bag, can you stack enough?
Throw the ones, throw the tens, throw a stack of dubs
She ain't tryin' to fuck, she just want money up
Yeah, whoa, in the back the club
Fill the plastic bag, can you stack enough?
Throw the ones, throw the tens, throw a stack of dubs
She ain't tryin' to fuck, she just want money up
