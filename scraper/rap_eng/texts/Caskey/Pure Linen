[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G.]
We just chillin', milk 'em, top billin'
Silk and pure linen — top billin' — pure linen-linen
We just chillin', milk 'em, top billin'
Silk and pure linen — top billin' — pure linen-linen
We just chillin', milk 'em, top billin'
Silk and pure linen — top billin' — pure linen-linen
We just chillin', milk 'em, top billin'
Silk and pure linen — top billin' — pure linen-linen
We just chillin', milk 'em, top billin'
Silk and pure linen — top billin' — pure linen-linen

[Verse 1: Caskey]
It's been a fabulous life, 21st floor, wonder what I'm searching it for
Curtains soft, take a breath as I emerge through the door
Light shines in Bright Pine, I open the drawer
My shorty twist blunts, wonder what she learning it for
'cause I be rubberband searching the shore
Got plans for my man, put legitimate money inside his hand
I wonder what's the price of my scams, sure
It's all fun and money-makin', get in the damn door
I plan for multiple connects and ran stores
And dropped checks, give a fuck about your prospects
I'm laid-back-in-the-cut style
Never had no black Maybach, got hot sex from love childs
I'm not vexed, you run wild
Front style just to get you lost in the mist
Manager claim I got some style, popping the fifth
I drop twists and lock shit, haters' not it, but me, I'm just chillin'

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Coming back from the cut, sequence of signs signal my gut
Reach for the cup, sipping combination, living it up
She whispering that I'm a rude boy, "Can you get it up?"
I clarified, "The only thing that I ain't give is a fuck"
I'm dominated by approachable style, it's in my nature
And while plenty haters be jacking my heavy flavor
I be getting at them keys like the mayor
But this is the presidante, appetite your thirst for your entree
Ándale, just tryin' to make moves and lay jewels
Only at a incident injury to your fake crews
Your inclination to imitate
I wonder if your hunger be a hunger like mine, I take from your dinner plate
God knows I thirst for the fame, only disintegrate
Just to disappear from my eye, put me in a place
Just biting at my piece of the pie, it's in the sky, getting high
I guess that mean I'm fly as motherfucker and we just

[Bridge: Caskey]
Yeah, and all we wanna do is party and bullshit
All we wanna do is party and bullshit, yeah
Hey, where my fucking cup at?

[Verse 3: Caskey]
I feel I gotta take it back with this rap shit
Producer claiming that I'm borderline classic, why they been sleeping on me?
More rhymes than a mattress and I ain't been needing homie
But still I gotta have it, I wonder if that make me a addict
I stay at it like it's vital for survival
And my idols be the real MCs, bringing heat
Like they pyros, stay steady smoking some hydro
I'm too wise, seeing through to the skies, I ain't [?] in this game
[?] guess it's too real
Too hard-headed for deals
Too insightful and too complex, you couldn't get what I'm into
Try me and you'll see what my pen do, until then I'll be chillin'
