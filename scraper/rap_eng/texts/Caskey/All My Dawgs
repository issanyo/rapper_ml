[Pre-Chorus: ClicKlak]
Look I done traveled 'cross the country, all different states
All different cities, all different places
All different faces, money and the fame
Wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs

[Chorus: ClicKlak]
Without all my dawgs, all my dawgs
Just wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs
Without all my dawgs, all my dawgs
Just wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs

[Verse 1: Pablo Escabear]
Free moon, free smoke, free blow, free floss, free Jeff, free all my dawgs
[?] plays for coke ball at them shows with all my dawgs
At Greenwood Lake skipping class, smoking weed in bathroom stalls
Then crossed the street, hopped the wall, get some head from couple broads
With my dawg I did it all, took it there and set it off
Trapping in my wheelchair, Pimpin' dropping pound vault
Bucking high and on the run, Gwalla ducked a nigga off
Nigga robbed me and Caskey damn near blew his leg off
But I don't have to tell y'all how much I love y'all
I done lost so many dawgs, dead and gone, ain't coming home
And for you I'm going strong, I'm showing out, I'm putting on
I'm thinking 'bout you every rhyme in every verse in every song

[Pre-Chorus: ClicKlak]
Look I done traveled 'cross the country, all different states
All different cities, all different places
All different faces, money and the fame
Wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs

[Chorus: ClicKlak]
Without all my dawgs, all my dawgs
Just wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs
Without all my dawgs, all my dawgs
Just wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs

[Verse 2: ClicKlak]
If it wasn't for Caskey, Gwalla, Pablo, Yonka Boi and Dre Fresh
I done traveled 'cross the country, nan nigga touched me, maybe 'cause they know what's best
My niggas come and they rush and they hunt and they hoping to find ya, they hungry for flesh
I'm making the call 'cause daily we ball, nigga, I'd hate to be y'all
It's my dawgs over y'all dawgs, y'all all flawed so we tote pistols
Come sit on this tour bus, but I reminisce and I so miss ya
Just kick back with a cold drink, thinking what it might be like
Forty cities, thirty states, interstates, no green lights
No red lights, no yellow, I'm just putting on, it's whatever
Just know that when one of us gone, you part of my soul, we always together
I love you forever, I love you forever
Just know that when one of us gone, you part of my soul, we always together
I love you forever

[Pre-Chorus: ClicKlak]
Look I done traveled 'cross the country, all different states
All different cities, all different places
All different faces, money and the fame
Wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs

[Chorus: ClicKlak]
Without all my dawgs, all my dawgs
Just wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs
Without all my dawgs, all my dawgs
Just wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Flashback to Cassadaga with Gwalla, fucking these ratchet hoes
Keep Pushin since 301 and I'm staying there 'til my casket close
I give all you half of my soul, the shirt off my back, my shoes and my blood
I ain't gotta post a pic on the 'gram for these suckers to know that it's love
I take a bullet for y'all, pull that shit out of my skin, put it inside the clip, cock it back
And then shoot it for y'all, word to Pablo when he done re-uped
Mafucker, I'm booming for y'all, when I'm overseas, know I wish you was with me
Second I step off the plane and you wasn't beside me, knew something was wrong and it hit me
Like where is Dre Fresh and V.I.? Where is White Shirt Gang, where is Pimpin'?
You could have all of the money the world got to offer, it really ain't gon' make a difference
Without all your dawgs, did for this shit I could never repay
I ain't the shooter, but someone talk bad about you, I'ma spray

[Pre-Chorus: ClicKlak]
Look I done traveled 'cross the country, all different states
All different cities, all different places
All different faces, money and the fame
Wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs

[Chorus: ClicKlak]
Without all my dawgs, all my dawgs
Just wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs
Without all my dawgs, all my dawgs
Just wouldn't be the same without all my dawgs
