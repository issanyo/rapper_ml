[Intro: SKYXXX]
Yeah, I feel like Young Dolph right now, nigga
What, yeah, yeah

[Hook: SKYXXX]
I remember when them hoes ain't never show me no love
Can't forget it, yeah, I remember, yeah
So when they call my phone, hit airplane mode, hoe, I can't pick up
'cause I remember, yeah, I ain't forget it, yeah
Now my heart so cold, I sneeze, I turn July to December
I ain't forget it, yeah, I still remember, yeah
"I remember" is tatted on my body, just like memento
I can't forget it, yeah, I remember, yeah

[Verse 1: SKYXXX]
If you know me then you know, 2012 it began
South side, went to prison, came out fucking shit up again
I was lowkey all last year and I came up with the plan
Now it's Porsche Pedro 2017 with the gang
It's September, 911, I'm in the Porsche tryna leverage
Cuchi sit with the Glock, I feel like I'm 007
Niggas run up on my gang, we got more weapons than Tekken
Blasting 'em off like shogun, we like "fuck what you reppin'"
We got hoes inside the sprinter, we got dope in the bus
Hold up nigga, please don't even try no hoe shit with us
'cause we ain't tryna discuss nothin', homeboy, we all gon' bust
[?] on your mans, and no, I'm not finna trust (I can't)

[Hook: SKYXXX]
I remember when them hoes ain't never show me no love
I can't forget it, yeah, so I remember, yeah
When they call my phone, hit airplane mode, hoe, I can't pick up
'cause I remember, ay, I ain't forget it, yeah
Now my heart so cold, I sneeze, I turn July to December
'cause I remember, ay, I ain't forget it, yeah, ay
"Can't forget" is tatted on my body, just like memento
I can't forget it, yeah, so I remember, yeah

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Okay, I did my dirt in places that it's not safe to enter
I done seen so many bodies that I try not remember
Met my side bitch, gotta be cool, she might fuck with my center
Got that fire inside my stomach like I bite down on embers
Okay, I'm high
Think 'bout the day that we used to shoot out like the 4th of July
Work on the side
Well done, they tryna make it, I go and take what I desire
Look in my eyes
You can see I monetize, a Magnum is my condom size
No compromise
You the one who don't got nothing to say when a problem arise
I ain't forget it, ay, I still remember, ay
She let me when her man jumped out, I fucked her sister, ay
I'm no pretender, ay, you Master Splinter, ay
Y'all act like bitches so much, I can't tell your gender, ay
I still remember

[Outro: SKYXXX]
I remember when them hoes ain't never show me no love
I can't forget it, ay, so I remember, yeah
Yeah, I broke up with that bitch, but that hoe still let me fuck
Yeah, she remember, ay, she can't forget it, yeah
If you run up on my gang, I bet that you get wet up
So don't forget it, ay, and just remember, ay
"I can't forget" is tatted on my body, just like memento
I can't forget it, ay, so I remember, yeah
