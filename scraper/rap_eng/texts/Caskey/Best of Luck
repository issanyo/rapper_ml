[Chorus]
If you hatin' on me, I could give a fuck
If you go against me, best of luck
Oh shit, I put the work in, then get a buck
If you in my way, then you gettin' stuck

[Verse 1]
Bitch, you gettin' stuck with the right hand, right, man
All she wanna buy is white grams, night plans
Might just change my name to Iceman, so much ice, man
Beat the case, know the police wanted to indict, man
Internet
I ain't beefin' with these goofy ass boys on the internet
I'm so, so, so not into that
I'd rather get a check and say fuck all that pussy shit

[Chorus]
If you hatin' on me, I could give a fuck
If you go against me, best of luck
If you try me, dog, then you gettin' stuck
If you hatin' on me, I could give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
What the fuck I look like
Worryin' 'bout this shit? Not a bitch, ayy
What the fuck I look like
Worryin' 'bout this shit? Not a bitch

[Verse 2]
Man, I look inside the mirror and I know just who I am
You look in the mirror and don't know what the fuck's the plan
Man, I wake up, go and get some money, yeah
Man, the first thing that you do is text your hoe to get some cutty
Yeah, I'm feelin' like I'm Kid Cudi, ayy
All those tattoos on this wrist 'cause that fuck shit ain't gon' cut it
Man, I run it up, I'm never runnin', yeah
And I came up on the Stunna, how the fuck ain't gon' be stuntin'?
You pussies don't even know what's comin', when this tape drop
Everybody gon' just know how all my shit is straight dry
Uncut, like I got it all the way from Bangkok
Can't be trusted with you though 'cause all you do is name drop
Yeah, and I got my thang cocked
I ain't worried 'bout shit, man, all you do is fake talk (bow!)
Yeah, and I got my thang cocked
If you run up on the kid, get your brain popped

[Chorus]
If you hatin' on me, I could give a fuck
If you go against me, best of luck
If you try me, dog, then you gettin' stuck
If you hatin' on me, I could give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
What the fuck I look like
Worryin' 'bout this shit? Not a bitch
What the fuck I look like
Worryin' 'bout this shit? Not a bitch
