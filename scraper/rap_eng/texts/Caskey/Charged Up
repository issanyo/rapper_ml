[Verse 1]
Somebody gotta up the bar
These rappers all subpar, guns in the pics, they don't want war
I’m feelin' like a lone star
Try and come flock my way, get hit with the crowbar (yeah)
Drinkin' on Merlot, trap goin’ turbo
Murder in my city, G Herbo (yeah)
That's why I smoke herbal
They tried cut my legs off, jumped all of the hurdles
Take a minute, look at my whip, yeah
Take a minute, look at my bitch, yeah
It took a minute to get like this, yeah
Rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, yeah
Puttin' y'all up on game, yeah
Out of the rock like Dame, Dash
My top speed is way, fast
On the car lot, I'ma pay, cash (woo)

[Chorus]
Charged up like credit cards with the big amounts (woo)
’fore I bought myself a piece, I bought mom a bigger house (woo)
Y’all repeatin' all the same flows, I could live without (woo)
Lessons comin’ for the weak and I gotta give 'em out (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Mastered myself, switched up the priorities
Don't respond well to authority
Taysty made the beat and I'm who recordin’ me
All y'all talk about is bitches and lean
And that shit is borin' me
What's funny, you ain't got no more than me
I got the money, it ain't distortin' me
I'll speak of both sides, praise the most high
Bought a maybach just to ghost ride
Gotta stay strapped, don't provoke mine
Gotta stay back like it's low tide
Or it's payback endin' no time
But my pockets got a goldmine
It's a mosh pit, so it go 'round
Make a profit, never slow down (woo)

[Chorus]
And I'm charged up like credit cards with the big amounts (woo)
'fore I bought myself a piece, I bought mom a bigger house (woo)
Y'all repeatin' all the same flows, I could live without (woo)
Lessons comin' for the weak and I gotta give 'em out

[Verse 3]
Make way for the new school, rare like Mewtwo
Ridin' with the deuce deuce, feelin' like yoohoo
Clique goin' cuckoo, I'll 'em what to do you
And your crew too, did another bustdown, put it on YouTube
Slick shit, we could go tit for tit
Gettin' hit what I'm used to
Goin' through SoundCloud on the bluetooth
I ain't check the screen, wouldn't even know who's who
Lil Pump, Lil Xan, nothin' 'gainst them
Can we please let big shit win again?
A takeover of the rap game eminent
Fan's callin' me to go like my name Eminem
Shit pump my adrenaline
Louis purse on the kid, nothin' 'bout me feminine
Shots fired, I was sendin' it
On the corner in the foreign 'cause I've always been in it
Take a minute, look at my whip, yeah
Take a minute, look at my bitch, yeah
It took a minute to get like this, yeah
Rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, yeah
I'm puttin' y'all up on game, yeah
Out of the rock like Dame, Dash
On the car lot, I'ma pay, cash
My top speed is way, fast (woo)

[Chorus]
Charged up like credit cards with the big amounts (woo)
'fore I bought myself a piece, I bought mom a bigger house (woo)
Y'all repeatin' all the same flows, I could live without (woo)
Lessons comin' for the weak and I gotta give 'em out
