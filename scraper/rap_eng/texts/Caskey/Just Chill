[Intro: Caskey]
Yeah, ayo, KPE 'til the day I fucking die
Yeah, Bear, let go

[Hook: Caskey]
They be whilin'
Don't talk much
Yeah, 'cause all my dogs violent, this shit'll get real
Get acquainted with the steel, so I tell 'em, "Just chill"
They whilin'
Don't talk much
Yeah, 'cause all my dogs violent, this shit'll get real
You'll get acquainted with the steel, so I tell 'em, "Just chill"
They whilin'
I don't like to talk much, I stay silent
'cause all my dogs violent, this shit'll get real
You'll get acquainted with the steel, so I tell 'em, "Just chill"

[Verse 1: Caskey]
As I step through the fog light, it's Buddha
I'm lost like Flight 19 inside Bermuda
Affiliated with shooters, really hang with some rugers
And we all be on some different combinations, yeah, I'm losin' control
I'm in smoke mode, my connect connect
Get boatloads, they are not a threat, they a no show
When the fo' fo' explode, vamanos
Let these grown men fall in line like they dominoe
Bitch, I was an honor roll child and I'm wild, who you fuckin' wit'?
And I got style for miles, no discussion if
It's shine, well, that mean that it's mine
Shit, my family coming first, money second up in line
You could see it in my eyes
And if I ain't the truth, then I must be living lies
My grandma in the kitchen, boy, I must be getting pies
I wanna be iced out
But these haters in the shadow wanna knock my lights out
I tell 'em, "Just chill"

[Hook: Caskey]
Yeah, they whilin'
I don't like to talk much, I stay silent
'cause all my dogs violent, this shit'll get real
You'll get acquainted with the steel, so I tell 'em, "Just chill"
Yeah, they whilin'
I don't like to talk much, stay silent
'cause all my dogs violent, this shit'll get real
You'll get acquainted with the steel, so I tell 'em, "Just chill"

[Verse 2: Caskey]
I'm in the backroads
Choosing up the lesser evil of these different capsules
I know I'm an asshole, I've been told a hunnid times
All day rolling triple threes mean I got that number nine
And I got it under my waist line, come and try take mine
All my dogs heavy on the low, playing bass line
Out here with some killers y'all ain't ever seen
Someone told me nice guys finish last, therefore I am hella mean
Interstellar scheme, bad bitch, cinderella dream
And she wanna climb stalk, welcome, I got hella beans
Pop two, rollin', rollin', hit the town, slow the motion
I was so mesmerized, damn, there's something in this potion
Bitches in the back running trains, that's a locomotion
Me, I'm so intact with this pack, out here overdosin'
Then one of those hoes started catching feelin's
She don't understand that she just one in a million
So I told her, "Just chill"

[Hook: Caskey]
Yeah, they whilin'
I don't like to talk much, I stay silent
'cause all my dogs violent, this shit'll get real
You'll get acquainted with the steel, so I tell 'em, "Just chill"
Yeah, they whilin'
I don't like to talk much, stay silent
'cause all my dogs violent, this shit'll get real
You'll get acquainted with the steel, so I tell 'em, "Just chill"

[Interlude: Caskey & Pablo Escabear]
Ayo, Bear
Lil wigga
Ayo, set that shit
Bear!

[Verse 3: Pablo Escabear]
Caskey tell these boys, "Just chill"
Pimpin' say the word, your whole clique get killed
I ain't rolling on no pills and I'll hit you with this steel
Certified and skilled from all the juice that I spilled
Clap him up for real, I've been shooting niggas for real
Still remember the first pussy ass nigga that I killed
You were begging not to shoot 'til his chest got filled
I bust out laughing when I should've shed tears
Out here in the field, man, this shit get crazy
Outside of the mall, got caught with my three-eighty
All that red, must be gang affiliated
Asked a cracker where's the gun and lil pimpin' went to pay me
Four hours later, I'm back on the ave
Pissed off and mad, black teeth, black mask
Still doing circles, karma come fast
KPE it, man, I'll blast that ass
Just chill

[Hook: Caskey]
Yeah, they whilin'
I don't like to talk much, I stay silent
'cause all my dogs violent, this shit'll get real
You'll get acquainted with the steel, so I tell 'em, "Just chill"
Yeah, they whilin'
I don't like to talk much, stay silent
'cause all my dogs violent, this shit'll get real
You'll get acquainted with the steel, so I tell 'em, "Just chill"
