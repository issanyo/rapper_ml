[Verse 1: DramaTone]
Y'all don't want no part of me, I been in that garden, shit
Y'all can't match my life, y'all can't match my heartlessness
I been seeing dark and shit, I been popping bottles quick
I see 'em coming at me, I'ma rap until I'm God to them
DramaTone the godly one, hollow tip is hardly son
I don't got no friends so I don't answer when they call at him
I don't got no confidence, tell me if you likin' it
Shout me out on Instagram, I'll pop another Vicodin

[Hook: DramaTone]
I'm inspired by the lights and the pain up in my eyes
Thinking 'bout the damned, thinking fame is just a high
I'm not the same, I got the angels on my side, bitch
Y'all were never fuckin' wit' me, y'all were never fuckin' wit' me

[Verse 2: DramaTone]
I remember seeing visions over shoulders
I 'member when my mom was putting liq' up in the soda
I 'member when the cops had me and Vic up in the rover
With the instrumental bumping, had me tripping off the doja
And I don't think it's ever been a day that I ain't prayed
Levitate to Heaven, got the seven with the spade
I never been afraid of anybody but myself
And I was born alone so I'ma die all by myself

[Hook: DramaTone]
I'm inspired by the lights and the pain up in my eyes
Thinking 'bout the damned, thinking fame is just a high
I'm not the same, I got the angels on my side, bitch
Y'all were never fuckin' wit' me, y'all were never fuckin' wit' me

[Verse 3: DramaTone]
Call back, got a busy tone, text back, "Get with me, Tone"
Set back, don't get me wrong, I got love for y'all but I'll get the throne
Can't live forever, real young with my shit together
Real rapper I don't spit whatever, feel that I got clips and devils
Shout out to my real ones, JP, that's my kinfolk
AP, that's my big bro, lately I been skitzo
Ortiz, that's my family, Crucial, that's my man
And we got problems y'all can't see, I got the Devil on my back
But I got angels all around me, it's strange up in the fountains
I've been drinking holy water tryin' to change what I'm about
I'm famous on the 'Gram but that don't change the train of thought
My lane the same as God, I got the pain up in my jaw
Y'all fainting from the face of death, I paint it on the wall
I'll make it to the top and see Cobain up in the stars
I used to get so high because I hated what I saw
And everybody say I changed but I just paved a lane for y'all
And I ain't got no games of playing talk
It never been what I'm about, I'm silent if I take a loss
Quiet if I'm winning too, wired in the kitchen
Ruthless when I was a kid, I had to fire all the critics

[Hook: DramaTone]
I'm inspired by the lights and the pain up in my eyes
Thinking 'bout the damned, thinking fame is just a high
I'm not the same, I got the angels on my side, bitch
Y'all were never fuckin' wit' me, y'all were never fuckin' wit' me

[Verse 4: Caskey]
Yeah, they was never fucking with me, no, true enough
You broke and you wonder why, don't do enough, yeah
Broke bitches stay up on my line, I don't answer them
I had plans, money called me up, now I'm cancellin'
Hopped up out the rock, got like hundred fifty pills and white
All my homies calling me up, "What you fin to do tonight?"
Yeah, get up to the guap in the trap spot
Came up here from nothing, I'm a have-not
Matter of fact, I been hustling inside a back lot
We got Molly, grams, Ecstasy, weed and crack rock
Yeah, paved the way for some rappers, cut 'em off
They want amends, I guess they stay going backwards
But I can't, moving forward now, final quarter now
Hopping out the four door now, baddest shorties now
More important now, but the pain is just a high
So the only thing inspire me is pain that's in my eyes, yeah

[Outro: DramaTone]
I'm inspired by the lights and the pain up in my soul
Thinking 'bout the damned, thinking fame is just as cold
Y'all were never fuckin' wit' me, y'all were never fuckin' wit' me
