[Intro: SKYXXX]
God damn
Ay, I'm in a hurry

[Hook: SKYXXX]
I'm in a hurry, yeah
My vision blurry, ay
I call up my mama, whoa
I told her, "Don't worry," yeah

[Verse 1: SKYXXX]
I got a lil bitch, she a thot
Ay, I put my key in the lock
Ay, I pull the car out the lot
Ay, I done been fucking a lot
Ay, I done been drinking too much
Ay, I done been tripping and such
Ay, I got a bitch with a butt
Ay, and she be sucking me up
Ay, I might pull up in the 'Rari
Ay, got a bad bitch with a body
Ay, I play these hoes like Atari
Ay, she wanna wife me up, I'm sorry
Ay, hello boy, hello boy

Hello boy, hello boy

[Hook: SKYXXX]

Yeah, I'm in a hurry, yeah
Ay, my vision blurry, yeah
Ay, I call up my mama, this is no problem

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Yeah, I'm in a hurry
Got 'em for fifteen, I flipped 'em for thirty
I'm back, sipping dirty
All of these rappers 'round here should be worried, ay
I'm in a hurry
I called up my mama, I tell her, "Don't worry"
I'm getting this money, yeah
The last thing I am is uncertain, yeah
Bitches is hating on bitches
And texting my phone and they know that I see it
Tag me on Instagram, I say, "Delete it"
Sorry, I don't mean to come off conceited
But I'm getting heated, and I'm feeling undefeated
I got my stripes like Adidas
I sip the forty ounce right before the SAT
And still got the score of a genius
My outfit the cleanest, all these bitches tryna meet us
Man, I study all of Weezy
Baby called me up one day and say he finna sign me
I said, "Man, this life way too easy"
Father died when I was sixteen years old and I bounced back
I'm the motherfucking underdog
I'm the one these rappers gunning for
I'm the one counting up hunnids though
Riding inside Bentley Coupes and Bugattis
They know my name but act like they forgot me (Skrrt!)
Shout out my brother Jae Mill, caught a body
You the reason that I'm driven, I got it
I just geeked up off a gram of the Molly
AK beside me like I'm with the Saudi
They see the shine, they think it's 'Luminati
No, I graduated a summa cum laude

[Outro: Caskey]
I'm in a hurry, yeah
Yeah, I'm in a hurry
I'm sipping the dirty
I call up my mama, I say, "Don't be worried," hey
I'm in a hurry, yeah
Yeah, I'm in a hurry
I'm back selling dirty
I call up my mama, I say, "Don't be worried"
