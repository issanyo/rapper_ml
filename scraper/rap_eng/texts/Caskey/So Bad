[Intro]
I just wanna make a million dollars (Bad)
I just wanna make a million dollars (Bad)
I just wanna make a million dollars (Bad)
I just wanna make a million dollars (Bad)
I just wanna make a million dollars (Bad)
I just wanna make a million dollars (Bad)
I just wanna make a million dollars (Bad)

[Hook]
I just want the shit so bad!
I just wanna make a million dollars, yea
I just want the shit so bad! (Bad)
So bad, I just want that shit so bad!
I just want the shit so bad!
(I just want it bad)
So bad, I just want that shit so bad

[Verse 1]
I just want the shit so bad I can't get no sleep
It's been like a week
I'm callin' up Baby and Slim every mornin'
Like “yo! When my shit hit the streets?”
I just want the shit so bad
Think that I'm startin' to get sick
I'm thinkin' 'bout coppin' a brick
Takin' my gun to the bank and then hittin' the lick
These days I ain't ridin' 'round with the pills no more
(Ain't doin' that shit no!)
I ain't gettin' wild with the steel no more
(Ain't doin that shit no!)
I just want that shit so bad! Shout out to my dad
He gave what he got so I give what I have
I been too humble since I was a jit!
I ain't ever had a reason to brag

[Hook]
I just want the shit so bad!
I just wanna make a million dollars, yea
I just want the shit so bad! (Bad)
So bad, I just want that shit so bad!
I just want the shit so bad!
(I just want it bad)
So bad, I just want that shit so bad

[Verse 2]
Woke up with a brand new vision!
Ambition, damn man I can't stand wishin'
I can't stand sittin'
I got so much drive in my soul that it gotta be the damn
Transmission
I just want a mil so bad!
I'm stressed out, I just want a pill so bad
They wanna be real so bad they’ll do anything
Man the shit will make me feel so bad
I'm sittin in the car with the steel so mad
Like “what I gotta do for a check?”
Don’t let me find out you eatin like I should be
Or Ima put the juice to your neck
Ounce money that I used to collect just ain't cuttin' it
You gettin' taxed, it ain't government
Im layin' down the law like a punishment
Until I got it all I'ma grind that’s the covenant
Man I just want a mil so bad
I just wanna make a million dollars!
Pop me a million collars
Radio spin this shit it’s a million callers
Shit so bad
Bad, so bad
I just want that shit so bad
I just want the shit so bad
