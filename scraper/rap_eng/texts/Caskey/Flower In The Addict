[Intro: King Tech]
SMH Records
Get ready
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We the future
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Cyhi The Prynce]
Yeah, I’m the rose that rose in a dark room
Hieroglyphs from a lost tomb
Telling us that the end is about to start soon
If the sun don’t shine then we all doomed
These record labels won’t let my art bloom
They’d rather go and sign these so called goons
But most of them cartoons
And the radio is fucking up my car tunes
I’m just riding, burning gas, blowing car fumes
Tell the sharks that I’m sharpening the harpoon
Huh, I’m a tenth grade drop out
And they asking me to dumb it down
I tell them I’m smart enough
I’m just being honest now
Born from a town where the cowboy is ecstatic
Where it’s all about your power and your status
I guess I’m just a flower in the attic

[Chorus 1:]
I’ve got one flower
I’ve got one flower in the attic
I’ve got one flower
I’ve got one flower in the attic
I’ve got one flower
I’ve got one flower in the attic

[Verse 2: Big V aka Vito Banga of Nappy Roots]
Precious lord, take my hand
To overcome this, it’s going to take strength
God, I didn’t finish college, got a backstreet degree
So as I wade through the water, watch over me
My stepfather can’t read, mama got one lung
And bills tend to weigh in with a social income
And rap where I’m from, there’s tax on that
It brings me down so, lord, I got problems
I put it off for my kids, and motivation like this
Let’s get this shit clear
Nappy Roots is my lifeline
Say things to keep me in my right mind
Just at the right time
Keep the wind at my back, and a face full of sunshine
Punch the clock, rise till quitting time
I’ve seen a lot of things go wrong

[Chorus 2:]
I just want mine [x3]
Wasn’t I there... [x3]
Oohh
Wasn’t I there... [x3]
Oooh

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Yeah, it’s like a flame
Secluded in the dark
That’s me, alluding to the arts
See, we came from a luminous park
My sunshine turned to rain and abuse from the start
I graduated from the school of argue
Already know to tell
The world drained me of life, I turned pale
And though I tried to put sand in the bucket
I never could afford me a rubber or band so man, fuck it
I’m a lost cause playa
If it wasn’t for rap, I’d be a fucking with the cops out there
Heavy metal Glock all slayer
Can’t afford a drown, hit you for a quarter pound broad day
What guitar player ever hit chords without struggle
You wouldn’t know what rift to play
So consider what you fear and loathe to be a gift, that’s it
Just don’t let your talent drift away
Everything that shine, ain’t bright
And everything that glitter, ain’t gold
Just water me a flower only bloom when it’s sunny outside
And they lie, don’t believe what you’re told
I came through from the struggle

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
