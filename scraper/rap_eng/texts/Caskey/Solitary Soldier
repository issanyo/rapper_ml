[Hook: King V.S.]
I'm not afraid of nothing
Never have been and I never will be
Oh, so you're busy tonight? Yeah, I know
Places to go and got people to see
But I see that you found the time
To type something ignorant down on that screen
Pass around knives 'cause you tryna be hard
But I'm just hoping you know that I see
I'm not afraid of nothing
Never have been and I never will be
Oh, so you're busy tonight? Yeah, I know
Places to go and got people to see
But you know I hear that shit, all the time
Let's go face to face, right here, right now
Hide your cowardice behind the screen, it empowers us

[Verse 1: King V.S.]
All bark, no bite, spitting lines through the teeth
You're a coward, look down at the ground
Digital face when it's all said and done
But like I said, in person, you little to none
You say the wrong thing on the wrong day at the wrong time
I had a bad day, in the same way
Praying that I don't let these words spray out my air wave, man
Or I swear that you're good as gone
You lay a finger on my loved ones, even [?]
You won't be capable to limp, you'll be thinking tracks and dental
Push me over the edge and I'm going berserk
Into Facade City, man, you 'bout to get murked
Metaphorically gonna end horribly
This sounding morbid, I'm breaking authorities
Hop out the Chevy, I'm feeling euphoric
What's 'bout to go down, son, it's gon' be historic
If you keep on running your mouth

[Hook: King V.S.]
You know I hear that shit, all the time
Let's go face to face, right here, right now
Hide your cowardice behind the screen, it empowers us

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Momma said that I'm a soldier, tinted rovers
Hopping in and out the coupe, man, I thought I told ya
Miss me with all that internet need for closure
Y'all hit me with the Twitter fingers, I'll expose ya
I don't read into the comments
Bitch, if y'all was doing something with your life
You wouldn't have the time to hate, I promise
And I'm just being honest, turn your focus into being conscious
Only TMZ been making money off of gossip
You had your pride, but they see it though
Just tinted my vehicle
All of my partners throw up they gang signs like bulimics though
You wasn't 'bout that lick, what you tryna scheming fo'?
Break bread with your partners
Only time y'all break bread, with the boppers
Tryna cuff these lil hoes, y'all some coppers
Ain't a helicopter, but I'm riding with the chopper
Ain't a teleprompter, but I hit 'em with the shocker
So much pills on me, think I'm riding with a doctor
Only thing you riding with, impostors
When it's beef, it ain't over 'til they sing it, like a opera
Hit a high note, who you ride fo'?
Talk about me, I got killers at your side do'
Bitch, I go to OT with my rivals
The only thing I throw is perfect spirals, lil bitch

[Hook: King V.S.]
I'm not afraid of nothing
