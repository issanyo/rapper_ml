[Verse 1]
Some of my homies don't even recognize that I got so much weight on my shoulders
They think I'm rollin' around in foreign motors, they callin' me up for closure
I don't understand how it could be over
How you gon' hold me down? I'm drownin' in soda
I take the blame for every mistake that I ever made, but some of you playin'
Some of you people really flawed, you changin' your ways
You passin' judgement on your dogs, got somethin' to say
You couldn't set your pride aside, but I left my name wrote in stone like every time
Now I'm just a rollin' stone of "neverminds"
Some people try tellin' me I should sever ties
But I went in my heart and reminisced on better times
Is your soul on sale?
Momma still tryna get up out the cycle of struggle
She like just turned fifty, I'm tryna see her for double
Label threw me a little check, but that shit really subtle
That money disappear as quick as your hustle
And I still, still got the world on my shoulders
People only see the lights and exposure
Got me smokin' on high hemp
This shit got me drownin' in doja
Think my momma right, this a indulgent
It's broken, erosion, this moment is frozen
I'm tossin' and turnin', I'm lost in commotion
I can't even control it, I fear
I just pray the Lord know that I'm sincere, yeah

[Chorus]
God put this weight on me, hey (why?)
I told my girl go and leave the country
Bae, it's better not to wait on me, yeah
Some my friends see a lot of progress
And they just wanna hate on me, hey, hey
But I never did succumb to the bullshit
Man, I'm tryna stay, homie
Yeah, tryna stay down, y'all just play around

[Verse 2]
Y'all just so caught up in that negative energy and you don't recognize
Wanna work your problems out, gotta exercise
I was in the booth every day, tryna pressurize
I was puttin' in that work in, pleasure's mine
Steppin' on my toes, steppin' down on my foes
Ridin' through the city with the rounds in the cold
Some people appear to try, even the lows
But does a lot of lines, gotta read into those
Nine years old, makin' beats on the stove
Sixteen, had an ounce, tryna sleep with the hoes
Have you ever seen a black sheep in a Rolls?
Turned my life around, we was creepin' in do's
Little teen, smokin' on a piece in the bowl
Get to keep what you grow, goin' steep with these hoes
Then turn around when the Grim Reap at the do'
'cause you reap what you sow, oh

[Chorus]
God put this weight on me, hey (why?)
I told my girl go and leave the country
Bae, it's better not to wait on me
Some might only seen a lot of progress
And they just wanna hate on me, yeah
But I never did succumb to the bullshit
Man, I'm tried to stay, homie
Yeah, tryna stay down

[Outro]
And people tried the most to hate on me
God put this fuckin' weight on me
God put a lot of weight on me
God put a lot of weight on me
God put a lot of weight on me
God put a lot of weight on me
