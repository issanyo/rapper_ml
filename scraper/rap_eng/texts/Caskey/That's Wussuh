[Intro: PB Da Kid]
I had to make some changes in my life
Yeah, I'm gone now

[Verse 1: PB Da Kid]
Came up off some deads
Yeah, that's what's up
If she come back there to cool with me
Yeah, she gotta suck
Had to make some changes in my life
Yeah, I'm going up
Caught my way into the game and I ain't letting go
Feeling like the old George Jr., how come?
These hoes keep asking when the bowl comin'
Getting to the plug with [?]
Making beats on the dollar
He got the samples, he rock on
Forty-five loaded with hollows
Twisted like Otis and Milo
Thank you, Lord, for real friends
Oh yeah, I sin
I take advantage of my life and all I do is win, yeah
I've done a lot of shit in my life
Yeah, it's what I chose
I should better, no drugs
Yeah, I guess that I'm a pole

[Hook: PB Da Kid & Caskey]
Laid back, throw it up
Cruising through the city, on my way to the club
Who ain't fucking with me? That's what's up, yeah
Pop a fo' in my cup, that's what's up
Lean to stunt, that's what's up, yeah
Bitches in my ride all the time, that what's up
I just re-upped on a sack, yeah, that what's up
Hoes all at the telly, tryin' to fuck, that what's up
That what's up, that what's up

[Verse 2: PB Da Kid]
That's what's up
Smoking pine and my city on the rise
That's what's up
Caskey say there two bitches in the telly
Yeah, let's wanna
Popping bottles, get fucked up, that's what's up
Tell me which way to go
I can't even see the do'
Chasing the money like [?]
I got the sauce, I got the sauce
Spitting with sabre
Catch a body like a hobby
In the hotel lobby, yeah
PB 'bout it, want a challenge
Pop a Xan, now we ridin'
With my crew and now we ridin'
That's what's up
Fuck with me and get inside and yeah, I like it rough
Fuck the police, they can follow
Me and my girl, we at Prada
Burning away all our problems
Acting up, you will get swallowed, yeah
I just copped a painting
And my green done turned to gold
You can't fuck with me though
Always go big, never hard
We just call you bitches
'cause all you do is swallow
I'll see you later, man
Yeah, I'm all about my gwalla

[Hook: PB Da Kid & Caskey]

Hoes all at the telly, tryin' to fuck, that what's up
That what's up, that what's up

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Re-upped on a sack
That's what's up
If she come back to the hotel room with me
She had to fuck
I just left my old bitch way behind
She always actin' up
Got a little taste of getting money
And I ain't had enough
Two bad bitches in the hotel room
And I might come back, fuck both of 'em, yeah
Feeling like I'm Scarface (Why's that?)
These bitches keep asking when the blow comin'
Getting to the check with Pablo
Devil smile, el diablo
He got the dog food like he Ralo
I got the pistol loaded with the hollows
Get in the seat with my side hoe
KPE who I ride fo'
All the shit we done done tryin' to get the money
Shit, only God knows
I pray he forgive me
Confessing my sins while sippin' the Henny
Y'all been hating from the sideline
But I'm in the game and still winnin', yeah, yeah
I just popped a fo'
It got me flexing on these hoes
Last time that I checked
Your clique was fake, you got exposed
We just called your [?]
'cause you telling on your partners
I just went and bought all my day ones some brand new choppers

[Hook: PB Da Kid & Caskey]
Laid back, throw it up
