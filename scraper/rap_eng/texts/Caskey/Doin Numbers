[Intro: Caskey]
I'm doin' numbers

[Chorus: Caskey]
Ayy, I'm doin' numbers, I'm gettin' litty
I'm high as fuck, ridin' solo in the city, hey
I'm turnin' heads, hey, tats all on my body, hey hey
Love myself, hey, I don't need nobody, yeah yeah

[Post-Chorus: Caskey]
Ayy, I'm doin' numbers
I'm doin' numbers
Ayy, I'm doin' numbers
Trap for the summer

[Verse 1: ClicKlak]
Body count, bank account, bitch amount, numbers
I was postin' five dollar ads last summer
Now it's paid shows, makin' bands, no drama
Yeah, I'ma call my gutter, man
Ridin' with my glizzy, yeah, I get busy, yeah
Heard you home for the holidays, I'ma visit, yeah
What you think a nigga do? It's like I don't hang with shooters
I ain't like the way he movin', I told Pablo to shoot him, yeah
I'm doin' numbers, mathematics
We makin' thunderstorms, don't want no static
She wanna kick it, Crystal Palace
Two bitches, both sides, call it balance

[Chorus: Caskey]
I'm doin' numbers, I'm gettin' litty
I'm high as fuck, ridin' solo in the city, hey
I'm turnin' heads, hey, tats all on my body, hey hey
Love myself, hey, I don't need nobody, yeah yeah

[Post-Chorus: Caskey]
Ayy, I'm doin' numbers
I'm doin' numbers
Ayy, I'm doin' numbers
Trap for the summer

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Too turnt up, yeah, die 'bout my respect
My whole clique burnt up, yeah, doors up in the jet
I got a mission to find it, yeah, I ain't ever get tired yet
I've been supplyin' a variety of place, don't know why I want sobriety yet
I'm mixin' toxins, I'm drunk and boxin', turned up in Austin
Just flew out to NYC, I am not milly rockin'
Some hoe tryna fuck with me, said she won't tell nobody
Hey, she's just a thotty, I hit the pussy, I'm catchin' a body
I'm in the six, look like a brick, she in her feels, I'm on the molly
I'm in the hotel, smokin' up in the suite, then in the lobby, yeah
Dropped out of college, I'm hooked on chronic
My racks so honest, get rich for momma

[Chorus: Caskey]
Ayy, I'm doin' numbers, I'm gettin' litty
I'm high as fuck, ridin' solo in the city, hey
I'm turnin' heads, hey, tats all on my body, hey hey
Love myself, hey, I don't need nobody, yeah yeah

[Post-Chorus: Caskey]
Ayy, I'm doin' numbers
I'm doin' numbers
Ayy, I'm doin' numbers
Trap for the summer
Ayy, I'm doin' numbers
I'm doin' numbers
Ayy, I'm doin' numbers
I'm doin' numbers, yeah
