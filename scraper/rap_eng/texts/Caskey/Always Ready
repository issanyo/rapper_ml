[Intro: Caskey]
All my dogs are ready, all my money, made it
I got choppers right sitting in the trunk, they always ready

[Hook: Robby Rambo & Caskey]
They been asking where I'm goin', tell 'em I'll be gone to get it
I swear, this is not an image, dog, I'm really fucking wit' it
Said I'm really fucking wit' it if they ever wanna get it
All that bullshit they be talking, tell them they can go forget it
What I told 'em? Don't fuck with me
Got the bands in my pocket, they stuck to me
Whole clique really 'bout it, sucka free
Drought came back around, I upped the fee (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt!)

[Verse 1: Robby Rambo]
They been asking where I'm goin', told 'em I'll be back again
Had to violate parole, got me fresh up out the pen
Never ever got a letter, never ever had a friend
Only wishing things were better but these problems never end
Juvie life, I been thuggin' like, "Fuck it"
When push come to shove, you won't ever see me budgin'
I'm known to hold some grudges, I act like I'm the toughest
Really started from the bottom, man, I used to have nothin'
I put money on my neck, I put money on my wrist
I put diamonds in my rings so I got money on my fist
I'm known to flip a couple bricks, I swear, I'm really with this shit
Feeling like I'm Weezy Baby, tell 'em, "Get it how you live"
I get 25 bowls, and 25 hunnid
Make at least 50, breaking 20 like it's nothin'
Man, I told 'em they ain't ready
I'm the white 2Pac, tell 'em call me Joseveli, ah!

[Hook: Robby Rambo & Caskey]
They been asking where I'm goin', tell 'em I'll be gone to get it
I swear, this is not an image, dog, I'm really fucking wit' it
Said I'm really fucking wit' it if they ever wanna get it
All that bullshit they be talking, tell them they can go forget it
What I told 'em? Don't fuck with me
Got the bands in my pocket, they stuck to me
Whole clique really 'bout it, sucka free
Drought came back around, I upped the fee, yeah

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Ok, there's money in my pocket, feel like Bishop Don Juan
In love with myself, don't need no bitch to put Vuitton on
Can't trust none of these hoes, that's why you gon' rock the condom
I just Rick Owen my shoes and jeans and you in Sean John
I got pills busting out the jaw and some I'm gone on
And my Asian bitch like doing freaky shit with Wonton
You don't score none for you team, you should go get some pompoms
I just counted up twelve racks in dirty dollars, I'm John
I got bitches calling up my phone from four, five years ago
You got music you been dropping daily, no one hears it though
That's a shame, I just did Black Sheep 2 and that was 40 shows
I got paid in every city, made some fans and fucked some hoes
Make my calculated moves, you been shooting in the dark
Don't talk 'bout my mixtape, that's no music, that's my heart
All my bitches loud as fuck like that shit I just sparked
I don't do not talking, I just let my money talk

[Hook: Robby Rambo & Caskey]
They been asking where I'm goin', tell 'em I'll be gone to get it
I swear, this is not an image, dog, I'm really fucking wit' it
Said I'm really fucking wit' it if they ever wanna get it
All that bullshit they be talking, tell them they can go forget it
What I told 'em? Don't fuck with me
Got the bands in my pocket, they stuck to me
Whole clique really 'bout it, sucka free
Drought came back around, I upped the fee (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt!)

[Verse 3: Robby Rambo]
There he in the boot, Caskey smoking on a blunt
Swear to God we with this shit and most you pussies wanna front (On God!)
I got tats on my face (They ask if I'm a killer)
Bitch, I run it like the [?] working, I'm a driller
On a pill or maybe two, how I'm feeling? What 'bout you?
I think I'm the fucking man, now what you think I'm tryna do?
Scooby Do in need of you, 'cause you, you need a clue
Put the chicken in a stew and I put you in a stew, eh
Used to watch, watch us shoot needles
Always talking to the Devil, someone say I'm evil
Tryna feed my people, treat others like we equal
But to me I'm part one and I ain't never like the sequels
I was born to raise Hell in a cell
Give 'em Hell, all my life say, "Fuck twelve!"
Man, my wrist on froze
My Camaro candy red and it's sitting on fo's, bitch!

[Hook: Robby Rambo]
They been asking where I'm goin', tell 'em I'll be gone to get it
I swear, this is not an image, dog, I'm really fucking wit' it
Said I'm really fucking wit' it if they ever wanna get it
All that bullshit they be talking, tell them they can go forget it

[Outro: Caskey]
All my dogs are ready, all my money, made it
I got choppers right sitting in the trunk, they always ready
All my dogs are ready, all you suckers petty
We just counted up so much money in cash, we always ready
