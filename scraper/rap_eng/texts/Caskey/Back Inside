[Chorus]
Back inside the bank, back inside the bank
Hop up out the car, my styrofoam full of drank, yeah
Back inside the bank, back inside the bank
Got no time to talk, I'm talkin' money, what you think?
Okay, back inside the bank, back inside the bank
Hop up out the car, girl, that lean inside my drank
Back inside the bank, back inside the bank
Only got the time to talk 'bout money, what you think?

[Verse]
Okay, I'll trap out the Venetian, I feel like Jesus
People tryna crucify me, I've been slangin' theses
Everytime I ride around the city, got some pieces
And my homies that been ridin' with me since I peeped this
Out in Cali smokin' Cali, my life full of beaches
Everytime I rap, I charge a chopper for a feature
That way, I could stack up all my ammo, that bando
There my homie tried to make them racks out West Orlando
I'm lit, yeah, fire on me, lit like a candle
Can't fuck with you rappers, I just pulled off in the Lambo
I'm back inside the bank, hey, back inside the bank
Used to get them, piss and shit them, put some back on an estate

[Chorus]
Back inside the bank, back inside the bank (skrt skrt)
Hop up out the car, styrofoam full of drank, hey
Back inside the bank, back inside the bank
Only got the time to talk 'bout money, what you think?
Yeah, back inside the bank, back inside the bank
Hop up out the car, styrofoam full of drank, hey
Back inside the bank, back inside the bank
Please don't hit my phone if it ain't money, what you think?
