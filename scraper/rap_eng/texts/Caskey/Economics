[Pre-Chorus]
Smokin' on the chronic leaf now, oh
They just wanna turn me down, oh

[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy, I came on two blunts of that lethal chronic
Did what I had to do for economic
Don't know what this life would be like without it
But you know that they try to doubt us

[Post-Chorus]
And they just wanna turn me down, oh
But that shit never work out, oh

[Verse 1]
Hey, 'cause I'm smokin' on that big bag, drop the top
The Lamborghini push start, then it stop
Posted at the hotel, we travel a lot
Promise that I won't tell, we gon' flood the block
They ain't answer
So I kicked down the door, you know they see me knockin'
My jeans ain't Balmain, but we still be robbin'
Ain't from Chicago, we got nothin' in common
So let me know if it's gon' be a problem
We turnin' up 'cause we be on lots of dope
Last time I checked, she was in it for the coke
These days, women got a different type of motives
I'm twenty-four, but this here a forty

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm screamin', they can't turn me down, oh
'cause that shit never work out, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, I came on two big old blunts of that loud shit
Every time I hit the scene, change the outfit
Don't know what this life would be like without it
But you know that they try to doubt us

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm smokin' on that chronic leaf now, oh
They just wanna turn me down (oh)
Ayy, but this shit is goin' up

[Chorus]
This shit should be called "deaf," that's lethal chronic
Did what I had to do for economics
Sixteen years old, dime bag stuffed in my wallet
We can't cut no deals, we tryna turn a profit

[Verse 2]
Left out the spot, I got jays on my phone now
I got a knot, it get head like my own [?]
Workin' so much, all my hoes startin' to trip, yeah
So please don't call me up, I'm tryna get it, yeah
She got no business runnin' up the minutes, this shit no gimmick
Should've set up shop in New Orleans, he ain't got no limits
Man, y'all play too much, I'm over-scrimmaged
They won't let us in the door, all we want is spinach
Yeah, bitch, I got jays on my phone, brr, brr
Have to answer when they call (ayy)
And I got that forty on me, we don't like to brawl, (ayy)
And I'm in her mouth so much, she done broke her jaw, yeah

[Chorus]
Ayy, I came on two blunts of that lethal chronic
Did what I had to do for economic
Don't know what this life would be like without it
But you know that they try to doubt us

[Post-Chorus]
Smokin' on the chronic leaf now, oh
They just wanna turn me down, yeah, oh
I'm smokin' on that chronic leaf now
