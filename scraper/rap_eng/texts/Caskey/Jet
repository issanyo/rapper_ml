[Hook: Caskey]
I had to skrt off in the jet, ooh yeah
Put your tape in and it's awful, eject, ooh yeah
You a fucking bitch, do it all for the check, aw yeah
I had to skrt off in the jet, aw yeah
Had to skrt off in the jet
Put your tape in and it's awful, eject
You a fucking bitch, do it all for the check
Yeah, dog, had to skrt off in the jet, yeah
Had to skrt off in the jet
Dog, I do it all for the set, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Came through, this shit was beast mode
I was sticking to the G code
Doing numbers, they would think I had the cheat code
Had a plug, he was sorta like your bitch
And by that, I mean, the boy was taking cheap loads
You a cop, disappearing when the weed's rolled
Out-of-towners getting took up off of Lee Road
Got the bars that you always got the [?]
I send a shot 'fore it's done, then I reload (Roll it)
Never no telling what I'm holdin'
Beating on her pussy 'til it's swollen
In the back streets, y'all minds being molded
Both have seen in it all, but the difference is ya folded
And I unfold it, unravel, win the battle
Put it all in when ya dabbled
I just got a 'script of Oxycontin and it rattled
Hello TSA, can I bring this when I travel?
I'm serving at my shows now, syrup bottle got me slowed down
A hunnid forty-nine when I got the four pounds
Militant when I deploy rounds
Yeah, I call this shit my toy, but this isn't how a toy sounds

[Hook: Caskey]
I had to skrt off in the jet, ooh yeah
Put your tape in and it's awful, eject, ooh yeah
You a fucking bitch, do it all for the check, aw yeah
I had to skrt off in the jet, aw yeah
Had to skrt off in the jet
Put your tape in and it's awful, eject
You a fucking bitch, do it all for the check
Had to, had to, had to skrt off in the jet, yeah
Had to skrt off in the jet
Dog, I do it all for the set

[Verse 2: ]
Yeah, had to skrt off in a jet with a bitch
So bad, she be belong on the runway
I'm just tryna cool down, Chi, sipping lean, blowing loud
On the beach somewhere under sun rays
I've been working at this shit my whole life
Nothing coming easy, that's ok 'cause I'm gon' get it one day
And not 'cause I'm good, not 'cause I'm lucky
I get it 'cause I grinded and I'm motherfucking hungry
I don't hear what you bums say, this side, we don't turn down
All I did was make some records, now these hoes turned out
Paint the jet jet black, in it, we blowing burp out
Getting scrilla, moving weight, but this ain't no workout
Suburban all murked out, four deep, eight cups
Shit gets too real, won't even mix some [?] up
Living how I wanted, never cared about what fate was
We don't got that paper, but ain't never get a pay stub
They ain't wanna give the kid a shot, I had to take some
If you never shoot, then how the hell you s'posed to make one?
Same team I started this shit with, I never changed up
Got that shit right in my skin, won't go away with no eraser

[Hook: Caskey]
I had to skrt off in the jet, ooh yeah
Put your tape in and it's awful, eject, ooh yeah
You a fucking bitch, do it all for the check, aw yeah
I had to skrt off in the jet, aw yeah
Had to skrt off in the jet
Put your tape in and it's awful, eject
You a fucking bitch, do it all for the check
Yeah, dog, had to skrt off in the jet
Yeah, had to skrt off in the jet
Dog, I do it all for the set

[Verse 3: ]
We balling out, no free throw, I stay a hunnid like a C-note
Check that peephole looking for them peoples
Stay around more snow than a ski slope
I swear your girl down south with a [?]
'cause I'm doing more numbers than a zip code
Double back, re-up whenever it get low
Stay strapped up when I hustle and get dough
Lose weight, like a P90X episode
Rollin', pockets swollen, teeth golden
Yeah, it's frozen, overdosin', iced out coastin'
Got your girl wetter than a ocean
Smoother than your favorite lotion
And I got shorties' skirts off in the jet
I said I had to skrt off in the jet, though they often forget
I said I used to serve soft in the jets
Now I boss and I floss with the meanest baguette
How we made it to a bird now? It's kinda crazy how it turned out
Two and a quarter when I'm running with that four pound
Straight loud pack, nothing you could turn down
Break down, chop it down, serving out in your town

[Hook: Caskey]
I had to skrt off in the jet, ooh yeah
Put your tape in and it's awful, eject, ooh yeah
You a fucking bitch, do it all for the check, aw yeah
I had to skrt off in the jet, aw yeah
Had to skrt off in the jet
Put your tape in and it's awful, eject
You a fucking bitch, do it all for the check
Yeah, dog, had to skrt off in the jet
Yeah, had to skrt off in the jet
Dog, I do it all for the set
