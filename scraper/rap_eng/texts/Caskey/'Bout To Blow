[Intro: Caskey]
Bow, shit
Hey, I think I'm 'bout to blow
Caskey, New Eraa, Dre Fresh

[Verse 1: Caskey]
I pulled up with my partner, Fresh, like Illuminati
Seeing everything, ain't stressing a body
I'm sunken low in my seat, got my window
Elevating while I'm twisting up this Indo

[Hook: Caskey & New Eraa]
And I think I'm 'bout to blow, kush into the sky
Push it to the limit, boy, you pussy in disguise
I could see it in your eyes, that you not meant to make it
I'm a magazine cover in the makin', I think I'm 'bout to blow
Same herb, gettin' smoke
Same words, cop a different boat
They say, "I think you 'bout to blow, nigga"
They say, "I think you 'bout to blow, nigga"
Bitch, I think I'm bout to blow

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Sup? Low with my killer ride
Blunt smoke exit through my window, I'm a killer, right?
Conceal the white, complexion: fishscale
And if we focus on this detail, make a mill tonight
Kill the lights, bitch, I got her feeling like
Something 'bout to change and my lane is the illest type
Reveal the hate, beef arrive and I steal the plate
Ain't got time for bitch motherfuckers, they don't appeal to greats
And who am I? Jordan on an Ambien
All of my haters, they busy sleeping on a champion
Ample amounts of evidence cancel out
All the talking, they knowing just what I'm 'bout
I think I want it all, you just want a part of it
I'm up at the finish line, you just got your starter kit
I beat in the heart of this, you could feel it in my veins
Sipping on a Coke while I'm thinking 'bout the game

[Hook: Caskey & New Eraa]
I think I'm 'bout to blow, kush into the sky
Push it to the limit, boy, you pussy in disguise
I could see it in your eyes, that you not meant to make it
I'm a magazine cover in the makin', I think I'm 'bout to blow
Same herb, gettin' smoke
Same words, cop a different boat
They say, "I think you 'bout to blow, nigga"
They said, "I think you 'bout to blow, nigga"
Bitch, I think I'm bout to blow

[Verse 3: New Eraa]
Still got ways to go, but I'm further than you'll ever be
Disrespect these haters, but I respect all they jealousy
So whoa there, do not go there, see there, you're like my promoter
If your hoe there, then you show her, won't be long until I stole her
Or I steal her, oops, I'm wrong
Or maybe I'm right, maybe it's wrong
There's a couple nude chicks every night, tryna be my wife
No key, boy, 'cause she ain't my type
Bitch, and I'm gon' be rich
So control your bitch 'fore we size that shit
Man, I know you hate it 'cause I almost made it
So bypass you and hop off my dick
(Dick, dick, dick)
Man, I be packing these hoes, just smacking these hoes
Stacking the dough, attacking the low
You wack in the O, I'm tryna blow
And get back to the O, but back to befo'
I work too hard, the mat to the flo'
One year in and I rap like a pro
You ten years in and got nothing to show
So bitch, I'm amazin', records I'm breakin'
Pictures I'm takin', fans that I'm makin'
Know I'ma get that title, waitin'
Grind too hard, never be skatin'
So keep on hatin', I'ma blow like Wiz Khalifa
And watch me get them Franklins like Aretha, New Eraa

[Hook: Caskey & New Eraa]
Think I'm 'bout to blow, kush into the sky
Push it to the limit, boy, you pussy in disguise
I could see it in your eyes, that you not meant to make it
I'm a magazine cover in the makin', I think I'm 'bout to blow
Same herb, gettin' smoke
Same words, cop a different boat
They say, "I think you 'bout to blow, nigga"
They said, "I think you 'bout to blow, nigga"
Bitch, I think I'm bout to blow

[Verse 4: Dre Fresh]
Flow is number one, go 106 & Park it
Think I won't make it? You retarded
Failing ain't a option, I'ma be the best father
Heading to the top, better ask G baller
Now I'm not successful [?] trap
And guess what, nigga (What?) Chanel [?]
Ain't no Warn Bro money here, all independent
File my own taxes, I don't need no dependents
I'ma do it all, no matter what the cost
Just like Michelle, I don't fuck all
Swag slow quote, it's like I move in slow mo
Everything is worth a mill, you better get your cameo

[Hook: Caskey & New Eraa]
'bout to blow, kush into the sky
Push it to the limit, boy, you pussy in disguise
I could see it in your eyes, that you not meant to make it
I'm a magazine cover in the makin', I think I'm 'bout to blow
Same herb, gettin' smoke
Same words, cop a different boat
They say, "I think you 'bout to blow, nigga"
They say, "I think you 'bout to blow, nigga"
Bitch, I think I'm bout to blow

[Outro: New Eraa]
Yo Caskey, man
Good looks, homie
Homegrown
Spark one up for me
We out
