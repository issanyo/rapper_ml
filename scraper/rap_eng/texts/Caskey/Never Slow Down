Never slow down
Never slow down
Never slow down
Yeah, yeah (For real)
Never slow down
Never slow down
Never slow down

[Verse 1]
Clip after clip, it's a movie
You could get that shit exclusive
I'll merc your ass then get elusive
Hideouts in Daytona, Palm Springs, and in Eustis
I don't come around, you a nuisance
Steve Maddens holding my deuces, tats on my neck
To you lawmakers, debt holders: fuck you, I'm useless
I roll around town with Mike Buseys
Outcast who don't give a fuck about you and your truces
My bitch and my weed, they my muses
I hit them both, I'm abusive
Nothin' but true shit in my music, yo' shit is so filled with lies
That I see how folks listening could think that's confusin'
I got the juice in my city lil' homie
Don't fuck with me or I'ma use it
It's time to turn up
Like an ugly ass bitch gave her number, we finna lose it!

[Bridge]
You ever made like a hunnid million dollars, fam? (For real)
You ever made like a hunnid million dollars, fam?

[Verse 2]
I hate these pussy lil boys who be getting my number
Stay the fuck 'way from me
I got no time, there's shit on my plate
There ain't no vacancy
I got some bad bitches chasin' me
I got some good girls that's running
Fuck it, I guess nobody datin' me
Stagnant, that's something I hate to be
Least if I'm lone and progressing, I guess that shit straight with me
I'm 'bout to drop me a mixtape, I think this was made for me
Then I'ma spend all my racks, there ain't none I can take with me
Fuck how ya feeling, I ain't making friends, gotta pay for me
I'm putting tats on my face, told my momma to pray for me
My teacher went and bought a play for me
Don't want me serving, I told all my Stans not to wait for me
Used to be at they house faithfully
Begging me to come back, it's already too late for me
I'm just trying to get back home safely
Count so much bread, we gon' start up a bakery
Y'all want the fakery, I can't fake shit
I got something for those sending hate to me

[Hook]
Never slow down
Never slow down
Never slow down
Yeah, yeah (For real)
Never slow down
Never slow down
Never slow down
Yeah, yeah (For real)

[Bridge]
Ever made like a hunnid million dollars, fam? (For real)
Thinking we would never make it up out the trap

[Verse 3]
Big shout to my pops
I ain't tryna think about it, I've been sippin' liquor on the rocks
My mama had a run in with the cops, when she was eight months pregnant
Hated those mothafuckas when I dropped
Jar full of pills, I'ma go ahead and pop, why would I ever stop?
If dropping dope in the crib something that the feds don't like
Guess I'm someone they should watch
I got my money in the streets first, still throw it into knots
Bills knocking at the doors
I'm just in the club to host, after that I'm getting ghost
I just be doing me, these bitches they doing the most
Someone ain't love 'em enough as a child, I could tell by the shit that they post
I just pulled up at the coast, drop me a four in a Sprite
Getting cash and I don't mean to boast
Let all my naysayers roast
We ain't where we s'pose to be, but we sure getting close
I could feel that shit coming, just want the money, done had me a dose
Watch me approach, pull up with game for the coach
Now ain't nothing we don't toast, we've been doing this shit for real
We've been doing this shit for real
We've been doing this shit for real
We've been doing this shit for real

[Hook]
Never slow down
Never slow down
Never slow down
Whip, whip, whip, whip (For real)
Never slow down
Never slow down
Never slow down
Yeah, yeah (For real)
