[Intro]
Whoa, check the box
Yeah, from the shrooms, I just came to frame some minds
So much God damn drugs, got me passin' out
I just turned the living room into a castin' couch

[Bridge]
God damn, ay, touch down in LA, come to spend the guap
Yeah, time been moving slow, bitch, I'm bendin' clocks
Dip out of the Rarri, hop off in the Lamb, yeah
Started this with grams, caught three hundred grand

[Hook]
Run up a check on them boys, run up a check on them boys
We too faded to be pouring shit, we the ones making the noise
Run up a check on them boys, run up a check on them boys
We the ones making the noise, we the ones making the noise

[Verse 1]
Damn, touch down in the city, faded
I'm high and I done came in peace
Why the fuck they intimidated?
I'm high and I done tried to give your shit a chance
Fuck it though, we hate it, just did a 180
All your shit sounding dated, and that shit is goin' plated
My shit goin' gold, crazy
Rico, check up on my phone, look, watch me work
I got a Benz full of purp, and I'm trapping off the chirp
And I'm popping all the Percs, yeah, hey
Turned the hotel lobby to the trap spot
Started this with nothing, I'm a have-not

[Hook]
Run up a check on them boys, run up a check on them boys
We too faded to be pouring shit, we the ones making the noise
Run up a check on them boys, we not in Honda Accords
That thing, we got it off of tours, we tryna be on Forbes
Run up a check on them boys, run up a check on them boys
We too faded to be pouring shit, we the ones making the noise
Run up a check on them boys, we not in Honda Accords
We just tryna be on Forbes, tryna do this shit for tours

[Verse 2]
OK, balling so damn hard, I don't need practice
Bitch, I'm in the kitchen, got the dope, it's doing back flips
Most my homies, they not rappers, they just wrappin' plastic
And they not driving nowhere but the house got lots of traffic
We run a check on them boys, this ain't metal but we rock
Second that we hear the dope, it'll lock
And we going, never stop, down to work for an earnin' of guap
You working for someone, you punching the clock, that shit a bummer
I just left a meeting with the label and we the ones doing the numbers
You see my videos, yeah, I own the WorldStar
And you flex off in the ride, we know that's your girl car
Yeah, we heavy here, but we get lifted like the curl bar
I'ma do the stage first then I'ma do the world tour, yeah

[Hook]
Run up a check on them boys, run up a check on them boys
We the ones making the noise, we making all of the noise
Run up a check on them boys, got the trap doing back flips
Most my homies not rappers, but they wrappin' up the plastic
Run up a check on them boys, run up a check
Run up a check on them boys, we the ones making the noise
Run up a check on them boys, run up a check on them boys
We the ones making the noise, we tryna be on top of Forbes
