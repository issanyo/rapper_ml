[Verse 2: Caskey]
Yeah, no, no, no, why you cozy? You so fake
Hey, no, no, no, can't sit back, too much at stake
Yeah, no, no, no, they wan' try me for the cake
But no, no, no, they gon' front
And bring my brick back, got this chopper, got this kickback
Slick back, sendin' shots out and push yo' wig back
Dispatch, back on the mission, I'm too busy for intermission
It's like there dope in the kitchen, I'm bad at math but I'm good with addition
Ballin', I'm reapin' the vision, had to get back in with Keisha
Smokin' a blunt full of kiva, step in the trap with a bag full of reefer
Hm, that's that, that's that sit at the top and countin' the cheeba
This that, this that take her on a shoppin' spree 'cause she diva
She wanna, she wanna come to my house and I call the D on her
I'm gonna, I'm gonna get her undressed and sink in my teeth on her
Ridin' in my E.V.A
Sorry, you too late
