[Chorus]
Keep fallin' into these patterns
I'd apologize, don't think it matter
I could feel your energy from Saturn
But I keep losin' all the balance
And I keep fallin' into these patterns

[Verse 1]
There's some habits that you don't create
Unconditional, don't fluctuate
It's a thin line between love and hate
And you ain't got the guts to hate
I show up to the function late
Can't sleep, I've been up a few, days
You know I was high when I walked in
Caught a couple eyes, do it often
We don't care about them, what's wrong with
You and I?
I spend too much time gettin' crucified
Ironic, 'cause you say I got Judas eyes

[Chorus]
And I keep fallin' into these patterns
I'd apologize, don't think it matter
I could feel your energy from Saturn
But I keep losin' all the balance
And keep fallin' into these patterns

[Verse 2]
Tryin' not to deviate, yeah
This life not a piece of cake, yeah
I wish my pain would alleviate, and
Stack this, gainin' weight
Have you ever been down bad, tryna make changes?
Spectators don't even know what yo' aim is
Got your friends slowly turnin' to strangers
'cause I never did caution the danger
I'll be in the city with the top peeled off
They ain't ridin' with ya, you should knock it
Friends who got the most time to waste
Always right up on yo' pocket, yeah
And I got the juice on me
Just pray I don't gotta pop it
I've been tryna stay away from the fuck shit

[Chorus]
But I keep fallin' into these patterns
I'd apologize, don't think it matters
I could feel your energy from Saturn
But I keep losin' all the balance
And I keep fallin' into these patterns
