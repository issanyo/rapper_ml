... chopper, I feel like top shotta
Pounds in the [?] I make a bitch sing like opra
Whip the block up prosper, blunt so big like rasta
I see y'all boys, binoculars, y'all so fake, need a oscar

[Chorus]
Fly like space cadet, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom
Fly like space cadet, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom
Fly like space cadet, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom
I'm fly like space cadet, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm so fly like space cadet, just met this girl, got neck
Sittin' in the back of the two tone vet, got weight in the back, boflex
Five four three two one, take off, land in outer space, I'm next, yuh
Shorty wanna come 'round deepthroat, say her jaw big like T-rex
But my dick like Texas, Rich Gang on my necklace
[?] work out in metrics, on the block now like Tetris
Tryna get back, back, back, it's 'bout where I keep my jack
Miss y'all bunch of rats, tryna count up the racks

[Chorus]
Fly like space cadet, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom
Fly like space cadet, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom
Fly like space cadet, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom
I'm fly like space cadet, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom, pyoom
