[Hook: DR$W]
I've been on the back side
Getting double doubles like I'm Whiteside
Fucking with me like I got that Pat Riley
Everybody carrying heat, that Pat Riley
Everybody gotta get that double double
Fucking with a nigga [?] trouble
Gotta get that double double like I'm Whiteside
Gotta hit the brick, nigga, do or die

[Verse 1: DR$W]
Jumping out the roof, I'm in the coupe
Chevys sitting high, you know the truth
Representing Broward, you know the dude
That nigga, Drew, the nigga cool
Like T. Double, I do it for the kids too
What's up? You know I've been a G too
Since a juvenile, been a juvenile
My shit's so hot
Two naked bitches whipping up the pot
All your bitches thots, I am what you not
Like Weezy, I was dedicated to the block
Like Jeezy, it was trap or die now
Like Gucci, I was sipping on the lemonade
Two freaky girls' titties out in my limousine
Threw the money sign in
Once I knew I was a G, always out here shinin'

[Hook: DR$W]
I've been on the back side
Getting double doubles like I'm Whiteside
Fucking with me like I got that Pat Riley
Everybody carrying heat, that Pat Riley
Everybody gotta get that double double
Fucking with a nigga [?] trouble
Gotta get that double double like I'm Whiteside
Gotta hit the brick, nigga, do or die

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Gotta get the bread, pussy, do or die
Dirty Vans and the strap like my suit and tie
Gold grill inside my mouth, money multiply
Why you talk so much about what you don't supply?
All my partners got the strap and the toolie, they some bad guys
Looking like the cast from a movie, I'm a mad guy
Someone gotta pass me the doobie
'fore I put them blood stains on your diamonds, make 'em rubies
Got me high as hell, thirty bands in my YSL
Goyard bag what I serve out to the clientele
I got a Louboutin waller for the condoms
How much money you think I'ma spend on deading problems?
Twenty bands'll have you missin'
Man, I keep my circle tight, ain't no new additions
Yeah, all my homies got the strap, it's a new religion
When you bring the bread home, you don't do the dishes
That for my bitches, ay

[Hook: DR$W]
I've been on the back side
Getting double doubles like I'm Whiteside
Fucking with me like I got that Pat Riley
Everybody carrying heat, that Pat Riley
Everybody gotta get that double double
Fucking with a nigga [?] trouble
Gotta get that double double like I'm Whiteside
Gotta hit the brick, nigga, do or die
