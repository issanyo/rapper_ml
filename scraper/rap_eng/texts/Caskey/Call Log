[Verse 1: ClicKlak]
I say I just left the club parkin' lot from a long night of that rich shit
Poppin' bottles and spendin' digits and flexin' on y'all bitch niggas
I got liquor all in my system, I'm pissy drunk and I'm feelin' good
On the way back to my neighborhood, find me smokin' like [?]
I had bad bitches all over me, in the club, they know it's me
They all say they wanna roll with me drink chill and smoke with me
And I'm down for that, I'm down for that, but there's rules if you go with me
You suckin', fuckin', or owin' me, no talkin', you showin' me
I got a few bitches and a few freaks, couple hoes I met last week
Textin', callin', harassin' me, these the questions they askin' me
Like, "what ya doin'? Can we chill? Where ya at? Would you like to feel?
Would you be mad if I kept your grill?" And I ain't stuntin', it's the truth, bitch

[Chorus: ClicKlak]
I got some bad bitches in my phone
I wonder who fuckin'
I'm scrollin' through my call log
Like, "I wonder who fuckin'"
I got some bad bitches in my phone
I wonder who fuckin'
I'm scrollin' through my call log
Like, "I wonder who fuckin'"

[Verse 2: Dre Fresh]
Got a bad bitch from Italy who love cookin' that linguine
Lil splash of Egyptian in her, I swear she look like Nefertiti
Got her home girl in the passenger, bad as hell, Cleopatra
Windows down with them shades on, you know you bad in that acura
Tight and it's super wet, that pussy from the Bahamas (foreign)
Body tatted with rituals, real life Pocahontas
Got another bitch in my call list who don't speak no English
And every time she hit my phone, I tell my next bitch, "translate this shit"
You better watch your bitch 'cause I'm fresh, go burger [?]
I got weed on me, I got lean on me, with a [?] and I'm flexin'
I got a private meeting with a Puerto Rican, she a college teacher, no testin'
Got a brain on her that's full of knowledge and I love receivin' them lessons, because

[Chorus: ClicKlak]
I got some bad bitches in my phone
I wonder who fuckin'
I'm scrollin' through my call log
Like, "I wonder who fuckin'"
I got some bad bitches in my phone
I wonder who fuckin'
I'm scrollin' through my call log
Like, "I wonder who fuckin'"

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Damn, shorty, I know it's three in the mornin'
Keisha, Courtney, Tonya, Ashley, send 'em all texts and I'm horny
I'm waitin' for a response back, two rubbers my golden gun, I'm in combat
Catch a contact with a rich homie, if yo' bitch blow me, I Quan that
I got a sex problem, all I wanna do is fuck every bitch
Got a X problem, 'cause that's how she gon' end up
And I'm up and away in a couple of days, only fuck one time and she stuck in a daze
Man, I hit her with the climax after climax, then I pull my dick out and I bust in her face
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me, dog, send four girls a group text
Turn that into group sex, told her show them two breasts
And I'm outtie, dog, on this blue dream, I don't be cuffin'
Scrollin' through my phone on a routine, like, "which one of these hoes I'ma be fuckin'?" Nothin', bitch

[Chorus: ClicKlak]
I got some bad bitches in my phone
I wonder who fuckin'
I'm scrollin' through my call log
Like, "I wonder who fuckin'"
I got some bad bitches in my phone
I wonder who fuckin'
I'm scrollin' through my call log
Like, "I wonder who fuckin'"
