[Intro]
You know, listening to the smooth sounds of young Cas
So let'cho head bob mother fuckers and take a pull

[Verse 1]
Look i be tryin' to live
Coming back from this janky shit
I be out at seas
Major labels tryin anchor this, fuck that
Got myself a ticket up to Anchorage
AK born and raise was my homie [?]
Told me lay low in haze
I'm on a mission for pay
We in the same type of city where these killers will spray
FLA that be my home state
Love the way the sun always shine
A lot of haters in the shadows
Keep 'em off of my mind
I visualize with the realist of 'em
My attitude be tattoo like the ones on my arm
Never know what i'm on, so i'm really
And i'm done playin' games til i get my mom a milli, for really
It's not a dream or fantasize
Mind on the game but it's only to analyze
I be in it to win it
God knows i been in for a minute
And this a pussy cause this shit is infinite
And it's hard to obtain
Different state but the laws the same
Gettin' caught going hard in the paint
I get enlarged in the brain
Caught slippin' they was tossin' my chain
It's hard livin' when we livin' insane
But i be tryin' to live

Said i be tryin' to live

[Verse 2]
Look, D told me to go hard and go heavy
Keep my arm steady
A bullet can make ya head make a spread like confetti
I'm not one of these fly motherfuckers
I'm ready at all times
Know there is plenty reasons that i can throw mine
The realist, fake if you wanna but can't feel this
I'm optimistic cause my mic game gifted
And the plots specific
Got a mission for the formula
Illuminate the mic when i shine
Tear away your cornea
The all eye seeing is blind
This is euphoria
Lost inhibition to shine
And the story this is real life
Spoken in word, broke on the curb
Home is brick to brick, that be like choking a bird
I be laid back smoking the herb, odor submerged
Pockets on empty like how'd this occur
That's my word
Gotta wonder how these situations come to be like
And my tunnel vision
Itchin can't see right
Really hope the drama don't see night
Running through this world with my momma tryin to see light
But you know it's dark, me i'm tryin to be like Christ
But the devil ain't want me to be a'ight
And i be tryin to live
Shit i be tryin to live
So let me live, bitch
