[Intro]
I'm with Alice
In Wonderland with a hundred grams that came from Dallas
Blowing strong, backseat of my car
Worried 'bout today, we ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Man, I swear I'm blowing strong
I'm with Alice
In Wonderland with a hundred grams that came from Dallas
Blowing strong, backseat of my car
Worried 'bout today, we ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Man, I swear I'm blowing

[Verse 1]
Bang! Writer's block done had me trippin'
'Bout how I was gon' set this off
Fuck it, I ain't worried 'bout it
I got two Ls laced with codeine
My girl just told me, "That ain't healthy for ya"
I told her, "Blow me," she accepted
I'm rolling through my town, young and reckless
My blunt game been perfected
Man, I got one name, it's respected
All of these rappers here, they ain't my problem
I reject 'em like a foster child
Funny how six months ago, they was talking down
And now, they'll call me for a feature
Well, I might call up Wiz Khalifa
To ask him, "What's with the local reefer?"
And I ain't stunting, homie
Though the circles that I'm fallin' in
But I can't call you kin
If I can't call you when I'm down and out

[Hook]
Everybody wanna be friends when you got a lil money
Go and cop you a Benz
And you rolling 'round town making up them Ms
That don't make you phony, but I can't call you "homie"
If I can't call you when I'm down and out
Down and out
They tryna pull me underwater
And all they voices drownin' out
That don't make you phony, but I can't call you "homie"
If I can't call you when I'm down and out

[Verse 2]
Bang! Roll the weed up
First time rocking Louis Vuitton sneakers, I got my feet up
And I done re'd-up on some game from Pimpin'
I kept this shit so consistent, they'll just say I'm different
It done got me drifting into space and time
'89, man, I was in Blazing Pine
But in '92, I hopped out the womb, a grimy dude
And all these folk would remind me, "You, can't ever trust 'em"
Smell the pig from a mile away, man, I cock shit back and bust 'em
Rolling through my city, Robitussin, hustlin'
They think it's prescription
And I think they some busters who ain't chip in
And I ain't giving out no free game
Some folk, they care what car you in
But I can't call you kin
If I can't call you when I'm down and out

[Hook]
Everybody wanna be on the team
When they heard about the cream and you on the scene
And you gotta make all your dreams come true (Word)
That don't make you phony, but I can't call you "homie"
If I can't call you when I'm down and out
Down and out
They tryna pull me underwater
And all they voices drownin' out
That don't make you phony, but I can't call you "homie"
If I can't call you when I'm down and out

[Verse 3]
Everybody wanna take something, everybody got a motive
Everybody got a reason, best just to leave it and not try decode it
'Cause I, well, I always misinterpret shit
I used to take every old girlfriend just to be some worthless bitch
Who am I to judge 'em? I just let 'em be
I'm just rollin' 'round in this bucket seat
And reminiscin', pumpin' trees
Tell 'em, "Don't fuck with me"
Could have my secretary call you in
But I can't call you kin
If I can't call you when I'm down and out

[Hook]
Everybody thinking I'm gravy
Just because I got a contract with Baby
They didn't even know how crazy my life been, lately
That don't make me lonely, but I can't call you "homie"
If I can't call you when I'm down and out
Down and out
They tryna pull me underwater
And all they voices drownin' out
That don't make you phony, but I can't call you "homie"
If I can't call you when I'm down and out
