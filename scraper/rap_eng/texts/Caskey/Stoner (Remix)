[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a motherfuckin' stoner
I just put a forty on my wrist just like a boss

Ay, Ay, Yeah, Ok
Fingers off my stash this here is personal
You remind me of the loudest ho, in the movie, you'll be the first to go
Pussy, ass, and the kush price high, but it worth it though

Feet hit the ground, never look back, what I look like tryna be the 2009 me
One thing by myself that I learned my past, my ass, that shit stay behind me
And it's all about timin', I don't care about you skateboarder who grindin'
Ain't saying you a fuck boy, but I wouldn't sign no contract we're too bindin'

Florida boy and my favorite thing is getting fast money around slow cops
I'm a stoner, bitch

Running that money up, like ya 'bout to start trial
When you beat the case, turn into a stoner child
We don't stand in line, foreign shoes hurt your feet
Everybody stoned, weed, lean (molly,E)
Every time I walk inside the club I see everybody
