[Verse 1: BEHINDTHEFRAMES]
Know I've been counting my paper
Put it in bank and I save it for later
Killing it, so my line beep like a pager
Look in my eyes, you could come meet the maker
Find me rolling up in the back of the Rolls
'bout my game, flipping these tracks with the flow
Fam knew that kid would perform
Why you hating on me? You know I got it
Dead presidents overflow my pockets

[Hook: BEHINDTHEFRAMES]
In a line, man, I'll make 'em flip
Writing verses that make 'em trip
Reciting rhymes like all the time
Don't worry 'bout me, man, I'm on the grind
In a line, man, I'll make 'em flip
Writing verses that make 'em trip
Reciting rhymes like all the time
Don't worry 'bout me, man, I'm on the grind

[Verse 2: BEHINDTHEFRAMES]
Talking 'bout dedication, man, I got it
Since a youngin, I been up riding foreign objects
You can try and stop it, but I'm fluent with it
Last one who tried to stop it put me more on the mission
Get ignant with me and give me reason to get ya
One diss track from me would take you out of the pic
Little kiddie, why you tripping? I'm a grown man
Meet your chick, I guarantee I'll leave her open
My homie, that's your choice
Young Q come through riding Rolls Royce
People tell me what I need to be
I just log 'em with the trees, tell 'em "let me be me"
THC is the key to let the stress relief
Everybody tryna say the same thang
Coaching me, saying how I'm playing the game
Oh coach, man, I'm sorry to say
Difference 'tween us, I've been counting my change
You can't touch my range
I'm headed for the top, quick
You ain't never seen this shit, way I steal yo' chick
Fuck her then we go out
I've been taking her to places you don't know 'bout
I hit her like it's simple, for me to pull up with the tempo
Take you to my temple, in Miami like Winslow
She holler back like ten fo'
Cool, I'll be through in a few with the Lambo
Let her know how it really go
When you fucking with a big time baller on the low
Five star meal overlooking the water
Then we slide to the studio, you watch me go harder
Work I put in on the tracks' like what I put in on that ass

In a line, man, I'll make 'em flip
Writing verses that make 'em trip
Reciting rhymes like all the time
Don't worry 'bout me, man, I'm on the grind
In a line, man, I'll make 'em flip
Writing verses that make 'em trip
Reciting rhymes like all the time
Don't worry 'bout me, man, I'm on the grind

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Okay, difference 'tween us? I'm countin'
How can the faith of a single man really move mountains?
How can I stand adversity when I count this?
How much money do my bitches need for allowance?
I'm boundless
Riding through the streets, so amazing when I found this
Looking at my drugs, do I really have to down this?
'cause we all product of the things that are around us
I stayed afloat, I stayed afloat through the mountains
In my own league here, counting up the Benjis
I got shit to lose, bro, pussies couldn't tempt me
Yeah, all this shit just don't offend me
I'm feeling like a higher power probably really sent me
Bentley, just pulled up evidently
Two bitches in it, sucking dick and going gently
I fucked them one time, kicked them out, feeling empty
(Oh my God) I popped a Xan bar and it bent me
(Oh my God) Yeah, yeah, bent me, plottin'
Back inside the streets, going shoppin'
Switching up the phone 'cause the police always watchin'
All the shit we done did for the bottle poppin', what's poppin'?
You put in the work and you'll be going up the notches
I got the style that the people always knockin'
My bitch called me up and told me I'm obnoxious
I told her "had to do it," had to go and get the watches
Stunting like my daddy, coming in the Caddy
Bad bitches @ me, I don't even gotta ever send a addy, nah
They showing up when I'm at the hotel
When you're famous, gotta break out of your own shell
Now my diamonds looking water like they propel
All my young bulls selling work at the motel
Yeah, so I do this shit for 'em
Yeah, I'm 'bout to buy 'em all a foreign
