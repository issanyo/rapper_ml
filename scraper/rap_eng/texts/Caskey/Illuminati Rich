[Hook: Shesuccs]
I just wanna be Illuminati rich
Dripped in gold and looking like I'm riding with the one percent
Pussy on my plate, I can't complain 'cause it's my favorite dish
Illuminati rich, yeah, I need that shit, Illuminati rich

[Verse 1: Shesuccs]
Sipping, sitting sideways
Parked up in the driveway
Visualizing this lifestyle
Every damn day, so if I may
So if I may get it poppin'
I be Gucci shoppin' and I'm never stoppin'
If I want it, I cop it, that type of shoppin'
The never check your account type of shoppin', ay
Burst fire like an AK spray
See me come up every God damn day
Always planning on my next play, oh no
I'd sell my soul if I could
Give me the chance and I would
And I promise I will make the best of the deal
Give me drugs, money, success and appeal

[Hook: Shesuccs]
I just wanna be Illuminati rich
Dripped in gold and looking like I'm riding with the one percent
Pussy on my plate, I can't complain 'cause it's my favorite dish
Illuminati rich, yeah, I need that shit, Illuminati rich
I just wanna be Illuminati rich
Dripped in gold and looking like I'm riding with the one percent
Pussy on my plate, I can't complain 'cause it's my favorite dish
Illuminati rich, yeah, I need that shit, Illuminati rich

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Okay, my money stack up like John D. Rockefeller
Can't nobody rock no better
Somebody said that I sold my soul
They mad 'cause they broke and they not gon' get us
Eyeball the work, that's the all I seein'
I put the most high into all my bein'
I copped three grams off of three wisemen
My life EQ with the high ends
Money talk, y'all lost in the silence
My shooter pull up in the Uber with the wide lens
Shoot 'em up 'cause he lost in the violence
Whoa, I'm too faded to be drivin'
Whoa, I'm too enlightened to be here
I open my whole third eye so I see clear
I'm part of a secret society
Being broke is the only thing that we fear

[Hook: Shesuccs]
I just wanna be Illuminati rich
Dripped in gold and looking like I'm riding with the one percent
Pussy on my plate, I can't complain 'cause it's my favorite dish
Illuminati rich, yeah, I need that shit, Illuminati rich
I just wanna be Illuminati rich
Dripped in gold and looking like I'm riding with the one percent
Pussy on my plate, I can't complain 'cause it's my favorite dish
Illuminati rich, yeah, I need that shit, Illuminati rich
