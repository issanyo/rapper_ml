[Chorus: Doobie]
She just need some dick, that's a fiesty ass kitty
Diamond nipple rings, that's some icy ass titties
She ain't got a bra, is it me or is it nippy?
Molly in my snot I get higher once it's (drippin')
Drippin', nah, really
Doin' good drugs and I chase it with the henny
Nah, nah, really
Doin' good drugs and I chase it with the henny

[Verse 1: Doobie]
Go crazy, in the bentley goin' silly
Rich white boy, call that Milli and Vanilli
Litty in the stu on the molly and the pilly
I ain't talkin' 'bout heels when I say that I'ma kill these
When I say that I'ma kill these hoes
Where I'm gon' put 'em, honestly, I don't really know
I would keep the top on, but I don't like the ceilings though
Can't enjoy the head off the coke 'cause I don't feel it though
Yeah, I love the pussy and I get it quite often
Fuck her on the air mattress, fuck it if we pop it
Tryna find Atlantis, listenin' to Janis Joplin
Tryna take advantage of me, you gon' have to pop me
When I ain't had the juice, ain't nobody ever chargin' for me
I was bein' cool, nobody was ever callin' for me
I don't fuck with you and I don't mind if you know it
She don't smoke weed, but she get higher when I smoke it

[Chorus: Doobie]
She just need some dick, that's a fiesty ass kitty
Diamond nipple rings, that's some icy ass titties
She ain't got a bra, is it me or is it nippy?
Molly in my snot I get higher once it's (drippin')
Drippin', nah, really
Doin' good drugs and I chase it with the henny
Nah, nah, really
Doin' good drugs and I chase it with the henny

[Verse 2: Caskey]
She doin' coke until her nose bleed
She keep, sayin' that she love me, baby, you don't even know me
I got, pussy juice all on my gold teeth
I've been, servin' drugs since I was fourteen
She gon', suck my dick 'cause of the status
I've been, doin' shows around the atlas
Probably why I move from girl to girl the fastest
Say I hate commitment, but I'm always gettin' tatted
Aye, nah, really
I just left Cali, onto Philly
I got a threesome that's waitin' at the tely
I bust and disappear on a hoe, Makaveli, she hit my celly
Saw some bitches on my page and she gettin' jelly
I got the tommy on my waist, I feel like Belly
Yeah, and every time my bitch get a attitude
What she tell me?

[Chorus: Doobie]
She just need some dick, that's a fiesty ass kitty
Diamond nipple rings, that's some icy ass titties
She ain't got a bra, is it me or is it nippy?
Molly in my snot I get higher once it's (drippin')
Drippin', nah, really
Doin' good drugs and I chase it with the henny
Nah, nah, really
Doin' good drugs and I chase it with the henny
