[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Can I get the bottle?
Slime, yeah
My biggest problem's what video to shoot next, fuck boy

[Hook]
Made myself a boss, pulling up like Baby
Started this broke, just did a 180
And I ain't Eminem, but I'm doing something shady
Pull up at the show like the trap house, better come pay me

[Verse 1]
Turn the inside the Sprinter bloody red
Cough syrup got me turning to a muddy head
Last time I checked on 'em, they was runnin', scared
I been on the rise like I'm coming up the stairs
Walking through the bank and they gonna give me stares
A man like myself gotta get it, nothin' less
I was in the sheets, why your bitch is saying prayers
Now I'm on the phone with the suits, talking shares, God damn
Tats on my neck and face
Bitch, I ain't come to talk business, I came to get space
High like I'm out of place
Pulling up at the bank, only time I'm finna chase
Yeah, this is not a race, yeah
I been sitting out in first place since this shit started
You were tryna catch up
Yeah, I made myself a boss, gotta pay myself retarded

[Hook]
Made myself a boss, pulling up like Baby
Started this broke, just did a 180
And I ain't Eminem, but I'm doing something shady
Pull up at the show at the trap house, better come pay me

[Verse 2]
God damn, tried shooting at the kid but it got jammed
Sitting at the poker table, got the hot hand
If they don't know the handshake, they not fam
Dirty rhymes in the clip, man, it don't stop
Every time I see a op, call that, "going pop"
People saying I ain't conscious, shit is nonsense
They just ain't looking deep enough to the contents
But I pull up on some boss shit, shit exhaustin'
Your career ain't working out but my shit is CrossFit
I ain't got no fucking time to feed into gossip
Don't you know I got the winning team on my roster?
Think of all the great ones who done came before me
Chances are that I'ma probably be the same story
Word to Drizzy, word to Weezy, word to Nicki, I'ma pull up, get m√©nagin'
I'm standing out and you just camouflagin'
Got the password, location and the log-in, damn

[Hook]
Made myself a boss, pulling up like Baby
Started this broke, just did a 180
And I ain't work with Dr. Dre but I been doing something shady
Pull up at the show like the trap spot, better come pay me
