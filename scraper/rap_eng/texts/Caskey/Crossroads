[Hook}
Ya, i'm living life at a crossroad
Just thinking about which way i'm gonna go
Ya shit, my whole life been a crossroad
Ya, just thinking about which way i'm gonna go
Just thinking about which way i'm gonna go

[Verse 1]
Ya, back in the Audi bestowed upon me
Was the cali pre-rolled, i take another pull
Contemplating where the fuck i been going
Life been slowing, and me i'm trying to speed things up
Been pouring this liquor inside a clear bottle
My alcoholic genes seem to manifest whenever i sip
And near models seem to catch the worst of the lip
We get to arguing, cursing, and shit
The whole time i'm wondering how the fuck we got here
You got tears, i got regrets, both of us got fears
And neither of us fit for this lifestyle
Always say tomorrow gonna change things but what about right now
Girl what about right now
I'm always asking myself if, "this here the right crowd?"
Like maybe i'm gonna pack up my bags and go
And as soon as i'm about to roll
I'm looking at a crossroad

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cause see time, it moves slow
The hand keep moving clockwise
And these women, they tend to lock eyes
So i know they can see it in my soul
My chest full of dro
Ill effects since my pops died
Wiser every year i grow
This year i ain't scream Elijah
I get more problems, i say more fire, more fire
Tried to put off these decisions but they so dire
Like who am i to say i'ma be here tomorrow when i ain't promised today
Honestly, it's impossible to sway these hands of time
Similar to these hands of mine
I'm handling thoughts, the end could be coming any day now
It get harder for me to stay around
Like maybe i'm gonna pack up my bags and go
And soon as i'm about roll
I was looking at a crossroad

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Shit, my father told me, "it's hard to neglect you're old ways
Demons they carry on into old age."
Old J's, my feet living in the 90's
Burn a hundred and fifty blunts
I'm trying to forget but all they do is remind me
Went to popping pills, still ain't recline me
I'm still copping O's trying to put this shit behind me
But lord knows, i'm knocking on Heaven's Gate
And the door's closed
Facing the aftermath of my old choices
Words from the wise, i'm hard headed
Call 'em old voices, i neglect them
Always had the sister brush 'em off
But never ceased to respect them
And now look where the fuck i'm at
Living thrife, i had enough of that
Like maybe i'm gonna pack up my bags and go
And soon as i'm about to roll
I was looking at a crossroad

[Hook]

So which way i'm gonna go
Which way i'm gonna go
Shit, my whole life been a crossroad
Just thinking about which way i'm gonna go
Which way i'm gonna go
