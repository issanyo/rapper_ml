[Intro: Woop]
What you mean? What you mean? What you mean?
What you mean? What you mean? What you mean?
What you mean? What you mean? What you mean?
What you mean? What you mean?

[Pre-Hook: Woop]
Before I made a way, they was hating to the max
Now that I paved a way, they like squares on the glass
I MJ fade away, 'cause I want no one 'round my stash
I'm all in haters' face, I'll tell a hater, "Kiss my ass"

[Hook: Woop]
Like, "What you mean?"
What you mean? What you mean? What you mean?
What you mean? What you mean? What you mean?
What you mean? What you mean? What you mean?
I don't know how these haters feel like, what you mean?

[Verse 1: Caskey]
One time for my boy locked up named VL
I'ma fuck these hoes for ya, dog
Went to every state
We ain't just known here locally, dog
Came through how I'm s'posed to be, dog
Kush packs smelling like potpourri, dog
From the bick with some rich white parents
Put the kid in the ovary, dog
Back and I'm on my shit, boy
Y'all better pay your homage
Two gloves on, crew dumb strong
Me and Woop, we the new Muhammads
And we coming for the loot and the commas
Taking our coupes to Bahamas
Y'all thugging out on YouTube
I don't even read those comments
Bitch, got money coming in too fast
And I pimp too fast, and I'm running my M's too fast
Yeah, y'all don't pimp new cash
New wheels, new tint, new dash
Yeah, I be getting to the cheese
Y'all be in Wisconsin
Plug stay off of Mercy Drive
And he fast as fuck like Chris Johnson, sucker

[Pre-Hook: Woop]
Before I made a way, they was hating to the max
Now that I paved a way, they like squares on the glass
I MJ fade away, 'cause I want no one 'round my stash
I'm all in haters' face, I'll tell a hater, "Kiss my ass"

[Hook: Woop]
Like, "What you mean?"
What you mean? What you mean? What you mean?
What you mean? What you mean? What you mean?
What you mean? What you mean? What you mean?
I don't know how these haters feel like, what you mean?

[Verse 2: Woop]
I made so much money this month
I might buy thirty spots
No G shit, I like to move a lot
(G shit, G shit, G shit)
I know you're mad, 'cause when a bitch see Woop
She holler out, "Rock out, baby"
I'm a hood nigga, eat hood shit
Pimpin' [?] Cadillac
I was that lil nigga on handle bars
Now everywhere we be, it's cameras
We keep two zips like a analog
Clips on them look like banana boats
Molly all in her drink
Pussy pure and it's pink
Like Cubans, we gon' link
Million worth of dope cooked in that sink
Woop and Caskey, tryin' to stuff mills in Bugattis
Know karate, we kick back off Molly
Dick riding for the come up, what you stand for?
The loudest nigga in the room, but I ain't speaking though

[Pre-Hook: Woop]
Before I made a way, they was hating to the max
