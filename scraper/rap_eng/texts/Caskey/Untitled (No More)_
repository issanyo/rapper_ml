Woke up passed out on the floor
Forgive me this time, won't ask again
I don't wanna stop, give me some more
Know that we only got one life to live
Yeah, put me in the mix and watch me come back 'round
Hard to get a fix when you smoke by the pound
Take another sip 'til I'm likely to drown
In love with the cig, gettin' so...

... can't 'cause it's my only friend
[?] that's all me
Might as well, all that good sleep
And take another sip 'til I can't no more
Juggin' out the bottle 'til I can't no more
