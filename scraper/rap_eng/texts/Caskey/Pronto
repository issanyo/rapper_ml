[Hook: KidCan]
I'm all about a check, I pull up and collect
You're running out of time and it's time to pay your debts
I'ma need my money pronto
I'ma need my money pronto
I'm all about a check, I pull up and collect
You're running out of time and it's time to pay your debts
I'ma need my money pronto
I'ma need my money pronto

[Verse 1: Caskey]
I'm all about a check, word to my new Patek
Fifty-five thousand a show, I ain't got time to flex
I ain't got time for hoes, nah, shorty just want me to text, ay
Just flew in from a different city, [?] think I jet
I'm addicted to the money and progress
Just bought me a new fur from all of this work and this ostrich
Gotta run it up 'til I get nauseous
Gotta fuck more, in love with the process
I ain't got time to be hating on no one
'cause there ain't be no money in gossip, ay
Money my only accomplice
Look at all that I've accomplished
Ay, lil bitch
That's 'cause I'm all about a check

[Hook: KidCan]
I pull up and collect
You're running out of time and it's time to pay your debts
I'ma need my money pronto
I'ma need my money pronto
I'm all about a check, I pull up and collect
You're running out of time and it's time to pay your debts
I'ma need my money pronto
I'ma need my money pronto

[Verse 2: Unsweet T]
Everybody wants a slice (slice) of my pie
In the mountains, all I got is wi-fi
I'm that guy, Gucci slides, you need a pack, just hit my line
I got sour D and cherry pie, lemon haze and Barry White
All my bills got blue stripes, and my diamonds always bright
In the streets I'm whipping it up
Conscience telling me I hit my luck
Blew out my mind, I'm running it up
Yeah, blew out my mind, I'm running it up

[Hook: KidCan]
I'm all about a check, I pull up and collect
You're running out of time and it's time to pay your debts
I'ma need my money pronto
I'ma need my money pronto
I'm all about a check, I pull up and collect
You're running out of time and it's time to pay your debts
I'ma need my money pronto
I'ma need my money pronto

[Verse 3: KidCan]
When it come to the money, I plain don't know
She got a man, but I know that he broke
He ain't never seen pockets this swole
Keep a bad bitch everywhere I go
Diamonds on my neck and wrist so froze
Blowing on OG with my OG
Rolling up my Rollie, yeah
Filet mignon, you don't want no beef
Acting like you know me, you don't know me
I wish I never fucked with you
I should've known better, I should've known better
But it's hot like a sweater, keep the heat like the weather
I just want to see another day
Gotta keep on ballin'
Get that Porsche and then I pull away
Yeah, I gotta make a way
If it's the last thing that I ever do
Never will I turn my back on you
