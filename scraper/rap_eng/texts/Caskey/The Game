[Hook: Modo]
All I see around me:
Women, drugs, money, fame
Tell me what you see from the game
Tell me what you see from the game
All I see around me:
Women, drugs, money, fame
Tell me what you see from the game
Tell me what you see from the game

[Verse 1: Modo]
Used to slang for that pay
Hustle everyday, no boss to my ways
See the cops run away
Liquor and the guns, don't play
Bullets don't talk, they just bang
Too many getting killed for the game, no city is safe
Women, drugs, money, and fame
Nonstop Hustlers deep in the game
Tell me what you see from the game, yeah
Minimal work ain't gonna cut it
Spiritual words ain't bringing nothin'
Million dollar checks, I still want somethin'
Always gonna stay cooking and grubbin'
Ride or die type, fuck those frontin'
Gotta stay alive, making more money
Gotta stay alive 'cause I'm still hungry
Bleeding 'til my death, won't stop runnin'

[Hook: Modo]
All I see around me:
Women, drugs, money, fame
Tell me what you see from the game
Tell me what you see from the game
All I see around me:
Women, drugs, money, fame
Tell me what you see from the game
Tell me what you see from the game

[Verse 2: Modo]
Don't live to breathe, I live to eat
Nothing but another beat, the cash is king
I rap my dreams, you can't defeat
The passion that I have in me, I'm happily
Doing what I gotta do, spitting nothing but the truth
Always find me in the booth, studio, making new
Put me in that fucking 'tude, bitches mad with the crew
For the fam, what I'll do? Anything I need to do
Hustle nonstop and I'm glad to
Bitches, money, fame, let me ask you, what do you see?
Scared and don't move, you a statue
Don't be surprised when I pass you, where will you be?
Don't let the doubt ever mask you
Don't let the game ever have you
Making sure that your cash cool
Making sure that you have food

[Hook: Modo]
All I see around me:
Women, drugs, money, fame
Tell me what you see from the game
Tell me what you see from the game
All I see around me:
Women, drugs, money, fame
Tell me what you see from the game
Tell me what you see from the game

[Verse 3: Caskey]
What I see in the game
Whole lot of lost sheep
I was starting to think it's a off week
Rap game super fraud up, when we gon' peak?
Y'all know how many homeboys I used to be so close with, dog?
And now we just don't speak
Y'all know shit fucked when you get paranoid
Every time bigger than four deep, brr
Gotta get back to the dough chasin', more placements
2017, watch with the gold faces
Young guns, pockets filled with the old faces
Daddy always told me that we would go places
I'm looking in my crib, it's a fucking oasis
Ay, had to dip on a bitch 'cause the bitch so basic
Man, I had to put mac up on ya, rap pneumonia
Labels ain't gon' pay ya jack, they own ya
Try to take the flavor back, they clone ya
Turn your fans against ya and they stone ya
In the 305, I been the corner
Fuck a recent signee, be the owner
So much money, I could be a donor
Made a million dollars, I'm a stoner
