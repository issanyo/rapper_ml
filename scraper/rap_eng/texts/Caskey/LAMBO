[Chorus: Father Lucas]
Open up the Lamb, yeah, yeah
Whippin' up my wrist like it's some jam, yeah, yeah
Shorty, you don't wanna run these bands, yeah, yeah
You get [?] in a second, you a fan, yeah, yeah, ooh
Kickin' out the door, whoa, yeah
Yeah, you know I hit her with sha dodie though, whoa, yeah, yeah
Shorty giddy up inside my rodeo, yeah
All these niggas sweat like they some phonies though, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Father Lucas]
These bitches [?] I just popped a bean though
You're up in my dreams though, swear that I'm a fiend
I don't do no lean though, I cry myself to sleep though
I was born a king though, but my heart leak, yeah
Lil big, big titty bustdown, yah, yah
Rock VVS, that's my bustdown, yah, yah
My system automatic when I lockdown, yah, yah
Judgin' me, you wanna suck a cock now, yah, yah
Ooh, phenomenal
All of these bitches, they gotta go
Came in that bitch like geronimo
Suck on my dick and she tear my soul
Balenciagas on my feet, yeah
Look at these bands all on me, yeah
Look at these xans all on me, yeah
Nigga, it's hard to compete, yeah
Remember we humble, we came from the gutter
I'm thumbin' through blues and that shit went like butter
These niggas, they hatin', I'm callin' they bluff and
I'm movin' that pack and I feel like I'm huffin'
I shoot at these niggas but you're the one dumpin'
Your sister was playin' by me so we fuckin'
I'm hittin' that bih like [?] nigga complainin' and shit
But I got my nut in, yeah

[Chorus: Father Lucas]
Open up the Lamb, yeah, yeah
Whippin' up my wrist like it's some jam, yeah, yeah
Shorty, you don't wanna run these bands
You get [?] in a second, you a fan, yeah, yeah, yeah
Kickin' out the door, whoa
Yeah, you know I hit her with sha dodie though, whoa, whoa
Shorty giddy up inside my rodeo, whoa, whoa
All these niggas sweat like they some phonies though, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Open up the do's to the Lamb
Damn, this shit gon' go down how you planned
I don't like her, she use too much Instagram
'fore this rap shit, I was movin' instant grams, bitch, it's two-toned
Lookin' at my watch, she roll my chain, then she go two toe
And I'm with the gang, I'm with the gang, ain't talkin' group, hoe
I'm missin' the colors
I'm smokin' that [?] under covers
I'm movin' the pack through the summer
I'm fuckin' a bitch and I'm wearin' a rubber
Ride throughout the hills, just got my buzz in
And mine better than you [?] busted
Have my money or you could get dusted
Ride with Father Lucas, that my cousin
K, I see that fuck shit in you, keep my distance
Sorry, but I gotta be consistent
Can't be distracted on a mission
If you take away from me, can't be addition
Okay, I fuck her to pieces
I leave when I speak and I ain't takin' [?]
Doin' a feature, I'm sorry
But I ain't withholdin' the speech
Off in the bleachers, I'm off in Ibiza
I'm chillin', my visa
I'm eatin' a piece and I'm fuckin' the teacher
I'm somethin' to speak of

[Chorus: Father Lucas]
Open up the Lamb, yeah, yeah
Whippin' up my wrist like it's some jam, yeah, yeah
Shorty, you don't wanna run these bands, yeah, yeah
[?] in a second, you a fan, yeah, yeah, ooh
Kickin' out the door, whoa, yeah
Yeah, you know I hit her with sha dodie though, whoa, whoa
Shorty giddy up inside my rodeo, whoa, whoa
All these niggas sweat like they some phonies though, yeah, yeah
