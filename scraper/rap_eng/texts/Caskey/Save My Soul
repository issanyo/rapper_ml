Who's gonna save my soul now(x2)
(shit, i've been havin' a lot of questions)

[Verse 1]
Yo, what is life to a man who ain't livin' it
Sometimes i wish the Bible was right
I heard that rivals they fight
Settling disputes between a man and a man
But what happens when your enemies a cans
And Natty Ice, and Budweiser
I'm trying to be the wiser man
I coexist in a higher land
I set flames to the stage where a liar stand
And bring the pain to his diaphragm
Me i got the diagram
On how to expose the foes
Who claim they wit'chu but really prayin' you fold
I've been prayin' they hold on a 'lil longer
Grow a 'lil stronger
If every pastor i knew was a goner
Who can save my soul

[Chorus]
Who's gonna save my soul now (x2)
(man i've been wondering
Shit, i've been praying to god)
Oh i know i'm out of control now
Tired enough to lay my own soul down

[Verse 2]
Ya, word, ya
This the pyramid of Giza
Mixed in with a 'lil bit of Visa
That mean i got some bad spendin' habits
Knowledge of Egyptians
My momma was a Christian
She grew up inside a family of addicts
And alcoholics
What shall i call it
Shit, blessed that we made it so south of Charlotte
But i'm tryin' to make my way back home
Except back home
Everybody that i once loved gone
They see the changes to the way that i am
Cold
That's the product of twenty years
They probably pray that they can stay in my plans
Well i've got to change
That's the way to remain
I got stans a 'lil upset that i stopped servin' Os
One of my brains a 'lil upset that i stopped jerkin' hoes
But i'm try'na grow
And lock my destination when the curtains close
Heaven or Hell
I doubt that i could be certain for

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Look, i've been havin' these late night battles
Between mind and body and soul
Maybe in due time i have godly control
Shit, i read about Gandhi
And scroll through these pages of my past life
Ponderin' goals
Pawnin' off gold
Stolen DVD's from my momma
I got it cold when nothin' i believed in was honored
I found peace in the gangja
It didn't last long
Years later caught in these pills
Or what the fashion
Caught up in this life of the thrill
What do i latch on when everything i loved disappeared
And everything that i fear
Start to move ever closer and gettin' near
When the road ends where do i steer
I hit the engine i fall, damn
Damn this life is never what it appear
If god is one of us better start to look to your peers
Better quit with these lies
Playin' roles but if god don't come around this way
Then who will save my soul

[Chorus]

Gettin' high cause i feel so low
Who will save my soul
