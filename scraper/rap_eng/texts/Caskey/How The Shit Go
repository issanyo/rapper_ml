[Intro: Caskey]
(Pops showed me how to count 'em)
How the shit go (I ain't tryna live without 'em)
How the shit go (I don't know somethin' 'bout 'em)
How the shit go (skrt)

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Woke up with two bitches inside my bed
One of 'em rollin' up kush on the nightstand
And one of 'em gon' give me head
I don't pay mind to the rumors
I'm so high on fumes, I don't know what they said
Popped out when I was so young and then opened my eyes
I ain't scared to be dead
I just click with my clique
I'm so in love with my life and your girl so in love with my dick
I got the styrofoam cup while I whip
Yeah, yeah, I serve when I sip, just made the purchase then dipped
Back to my condo
I just got a charge, I can't go to Toronto, yeah
All of my bitches in Canada mad
So I click, end the convo

[Chorus: Caskey]
That's how the shit go (Pops showed me how to count 'em)
How the shit go (I ain't tryna live without 'em)
That's how the shit go (Pops showed me how to count 'em)
How the shit go (that stick showed me I was 'bout 'em, skrt)

[Post-Chorus: Caskey]
I think I'm in love with M's
I think that you jumped the gun when you got the Benz
Your sister tried to suck my dick and we ain't even friends
I think that they don't know the price I'm payin' for my sins
I think that the devil is walkin' with me in my Timbs
I seen him, I'm scared to start over, I'm makin' these ends
I think that the reaper is watchin' me, it's gettin' grim
I think that I'm scared to ascend

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Think I'll never slow down, I've been doin' 180
I've been on the FaceTime with Baby
Talkin' 'bout the game and how ain't nobody really innovatin'
And that I'm the GOAT, why is everyone debatin'?
Hangin' rappers on a rope
I was sixteen and I'm budgetin', Cool had the dope
I would go and lay a verse down in the closet
Then we go and take ourself a trip up the road
Gettin' everything I'm owed, yeah
How many rappers do I gotta fold?
How many times do I gotta spaz out?
I'm the black sheep, y'all just fittin' in the mold
I've been livin' in the cold
Down by the code, and I got my eyes on the dody
Anybody tryna stop me and my prospects from the promised land
They gon' die and it's slow

[Chorus: Caskey]
And that's how the shit go (Pops showed me how to count 'em)
How the shit go (I ain't tryna live without 'em)
That's how the shit go (Pops showed me how to count 'em)
How the shit go (that stick showed me I was 'bout 'em, skrt)

[Post-Chorus: Caskey]
I think I'm in love with M's
I think that you jumped the gun when you got the Benz
Your sister tried to suck my dick and we ain't even friends
I think that they don't know the price I'm payin' for my sins
I think that the devil is walkin' with me in my Timbs
I seen him, I'm scared to start over, I'm makin' these ends
I think that the reaper is watchin' me, it's gettin' grim
I think that I'm scared to ascend

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Yeah, fortunate, I'm like the wheel
My friend is bishop when holdin' the steel
Ain't no controllin' my will
Left out the battle like my team some soldiers for real
Ain't no king over my hill
All us, we equal, we build
Greedy, yo' sequel is kill
Friends start to turn into foes
Next thing you know, your heart lethal and still
When yo' ego is still
It's easy to love people, easy to chill
'cept when you all on the pill and the white at the same time
You start to don't know who is real
Familiar with both, tellin' my lies under oath
Stashin' my pies in the sofa
If you righteous, you dyin', you make it to heaven
You don't, when you die, you a ghost

[Chorus: Caskey]
That's how the shit go (Pops showed me how to count 'em)
How the shit go (I ain't tryna live without 'em)
That's how the shit go (Pops showed me how to count 'em)
How the shit go (that stick showed me I was 'bout 'em, skrt)

[Post-Chorus: Caskey]
I think I'm in love with M's
I think that you jumped the gun when you got the Benz
Your sister tried to suck my dick and we ain't even friends
I think that they don't know the price I'm payin' for my sins
I think that the devil is walkin' with me in my Timbs
I seen him, I'm scared to start over, I'm makin' these ends
I think that the reaper is watchin' me, it's gettin' grim
I think that I'm scared to ascend
