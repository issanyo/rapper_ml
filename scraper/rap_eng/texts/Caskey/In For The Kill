[Verse 1: Caskey]
I been asleep for far too long
It feels good to be alive when we're sitting at home
Thinking we all caught, knowing when I drop mine
It'll be an onslaught, homie, it's time
And boy the times remind me that Nostradamus [?] gave signs
While they was in the cycle, I was getting mine
With a couple Einsteins and planning my arrival, so vital
Don't got the time to waste, just slang bibles
Our kids got time to face [?]
'Cause they see all these TV shows and no American idol
Who gon' be it?
I'm tryin' to take the truth and OD it
They say the real is back, I don't see it
So if we gotta burn a couple MCs, so be it
I put 'em all at the stake, set fire to the whole thang
Tell me who fake and who real and who ain't
Or if we all got chains we can't break out
I was asleep, I'm awake now

[Chorus: Elly Jackson & Caskey]
We can fight our desires, ooh
But when we start making fires (I was asleep, I'm awake now)
We get ever so hot (Yeah) ooh
Whether we like it or not (I was asleep, I'm awake now)
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill (Yeah)
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse 2: Caskey]
I swear, I had two shots
And no one's caught, God damn
The plan was out of wack, the crack turned to sand
My lucid dream detached, I'm back, into the landscape
Whoa, I work till my hand break
Push that work like it's my Aunt Tay
Into the center of the pot, my [?] unlocked
Government say I got a criminal plot
Couldn't never say I tried to help ya to criminal [?]
And those are subliminal shots
Got something to say, I'll put you on blast in the Colosseum
God body, should've been a Mausoleum
They say you got clones, but they don't know how to be him
Plus he got hoes, but they don't wake up till the PM
Never get to see him 'cause he in the studio and can't break out
I was asleep, I'm awake now

[Chorus: Elly Jackson & Caskey]
We can fight our desires, ooh
But when we start making fires (I was asleep, I'm awake now)
We get ever so hot (Yeah) ooh
Whether we like it or not (I was asleep, I'm awake now)
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill (Yeah)
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Yo, this is just me when I'm alone, grandmama living upstate
My mama at home looking like she ain't got faith
My sister in a rat race, I been in the game
But I ain't coming in last place, way too many ash trays
Been a lot of pain since my father went and passed, wait
I ain't get to say goodbye to him on his last day
So excuse me if I'm bitter
And excuse me if these hoes, they looking like gold diggers
I'm a cold killer, another told me "go figure"
Mistook me for just being a rapper and dro dealer
And then he slipped up, the trigger got pulled
I live in the times when shit live, liquor is cool
Kids don't go to school, everyone and they mama pack a tool
So, it makes sense to pack two
Is that cool? I'm sorry for the time I had to take out
I was asleep, I'm awake now

[Chorus: Elly Jackson & Caskey]
We can fight our desires, ooh
But when we start making fires (I was asleep, I'm awake now)
We get ever so hot (Yeah) ooh
Whether we like it or not (I was asleep, I'm awake now)
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill (Yeah)
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
