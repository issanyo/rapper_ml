[Verse 1]
Ya something about this organized religion
I don't like it
I use to go to church when i was younger
My hunger for divinity was infinity
Holy Spirit led it into me
Man something about this organized religion seem enemy
I know that god is the inner me
One love, Namaste
You can't always trust what the honest say
Some good people spend too much time inside they head try'na contemplate
They never get in touch with they soul
Never feel that one connected-ness with the whole
I ain't try'na say that God ain't real
Sayin' God don't need your ten percent
He ain't damning the innocent
We planning the immanent
This one here is for survival
Atheist say it's all a lie
And blame the Bible
Me, i think it's rather insightful, even vital
But you gotta learn to read on your own
And lead on your own
And learn to harvest seeds on your own
And be on your own
Solitude can reconnect the spirit
The mind is a place to adore
If you could clear it
And be near it
Without letting your thoughts steer it
Take hold of the wheel
This right here is a soldier for real
I swear we got an army that's enlighten
If you would only look for the truths inside of writing
Then you tried to find the meaning of life
And what is life-less

[Chorus]
They say hallelujah
Then they pull out them collection plates
Until i tried to map the rights
And they refute it in my face
That be the man they say is responsible for creation
Made the world in seven days just to get to themselves
I see them preachers on T.V
Livin' like MTV Cribs
Now that's some bullshit, ya'yaaa
Please don't get me wrong
I'm high in my zone
I'm just sayin' though

I feel a little skeptical
I feel a little skeptical now(x2)

[Verse 2]
Skeptical to say the least
I'm reading books about the flower of life
Try'na harness all the powers of life
Catchin' the vibe
Spendin' more time in meditation
They use to use God in favor of segregation
They use to use God in favor of mass genocide
Laws you had to memorize
And i'm just try'na generalize
Incredible ties to government officials who lie
It's fueling the fire
My old church was Methodist
I had a couple questions by the time we hit Exodus
Guess they didn't like my intuition
They claim that there was one way
You hear it every Sunday out the mouth of the preacher
Who got on without reception
It's like a finger and a moon
Religion ain't no longer my obsession
But with more passion i've been infused
I spread love mane (Woah)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
What kind of preacher drive a Bentley
Thought that he was suppose to be like Christ
Pockets empty don't tempt me
I swear i might expose all of these clones
Who claim they inside the house of the lord
But really alone
Hope they get hit with a stone
I read about the Council of Nicaea
I swear that they just condense God into an idea
And i see a disconnection in the equation, the temptation
They never felt the sensation of God
They just seen the imitation of God
Living lies man i hate the facade
They wonder why shit been goin' on the way that it is
We all gon' pay for our sins
But we ain't payin' for the Benz
And mistaken the ends for what is formless
God work in mysterious ways
And if you believe that the universe is so benevolent
That it had formed us
Well then don't scorn us for being different
Ya lil' bitches

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Commercial preacher)
