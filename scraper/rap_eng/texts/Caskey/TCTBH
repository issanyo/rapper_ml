[Verse 1: Caskey]
Touch down in a makeshift spaceship
Before the times of evolution where I'm about to go ape shit
She been in the face of wild beasts and dinosaurs, I don't take shit
I'ma break shit, y'all still worshipping false gods, I'm a atheist
And I'm still, still waking up early when I work the late shift
Motivating, here to spread love, make the hate shift
Pull these suckers out the matrix
The good plugs, they're far away, you gotta take trips
Saw fast money back in '09, I ain't slowed up or hit the brake since
I could make a hunnid out of eight cents
I could make a city out of eight tints
Bad bitch in my ride, homie, I hate [?]
We got the weight and y'all weightless
Still stuck on the waitin' list
I don't like the police or the bacon bits
I just keep it hunnid, y'all like 86
I just packed the bong, did like eighty hits
Fornicating on your lady's tits
And I'm sucking on 'em, taking baby sips
Probably turn her to a crazy bitch
I'm crazy, bitch
The greatest and this here ain't even my greatest hits
This just my latest shits

[Chorus: Caskey]
I'm getting money like I never, ever, ever thought I would
Yea yea, uh huh
And I'm too cool to be Hollywood
Yea yea, uh huh
I'm getting money like I never, ever, ever thought I would
Yea yea, uh huh
And I'm too cool to be Hollywood
Yea yea, uh huh
I'm getting money like I never, ever, ever thought I would

[Bridge: Mick Comte]
Ay, on another level
Me yayo [?] the rough boy
Siggy, siggy, ah!

[Verse 2: Mick Comte]
Soon as I'm mooning on that peach
Creepy music and neon lights
That's how much more money my brain finna detach
All that I thought that I knew, that I knew indeed
Excel in my exodus
Exceeded with the necessity to do right for anyone that I love
City boys and countryside
I'm an all [?] four-wheel drive kind of guy
Never pork on my plate, boy
But still going ham (still going ham)
Vegetarian and she handle the beef
Now he depleted by [?] the ladies, just doing my thing
Miles away from head bop
And what's already been done, you see
Don't condone in none of them
Can I vent the Aries?
He's still finna end up right in front of you
When you least expected it, fool
Need two, finna turn a 24 hour
Round trip into a quick loop
When you look up in the sky
With the certainty that the star is the light
Just know that in real life
Y'all just a witness of another planet that dies
That's why young Caskey and I
We ain't never, ever gonna let it slide
And leave some sun in your spotlight

[Chorus: Caskey]
I'm getting money like I never, ever, ever thought I would
Yea yea, uh huh
And I'm too cool to be Hollywood
Yea yea, uh huh
I'm getting money like I never, ever, ever thought I would
Yea yea, uh huh
And I'm too cool to be Hollywood
Yea yea, uh huh
I'm getting money like I never, ever, ever thought I would
