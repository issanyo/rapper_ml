[Intro]
In order for us to better as a generation, we just need to love each other more. We need to care. We need to give a shit about each other, I mean, too many people don't. Too many people allow all the negative things in the world to influence them and they're negative. And I think it's just a vicious cycle
Yeah

[Bridge]
Don't you think we could make it work out?
If we just both put a little effort
Shorty, I think we could work it out
We just need a little effort

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm driftin' in a fantasy
Losin' touch with sanity, oh
I'm driftin' in a fantasy
Losin' touch with sanity, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm driftin' in a fantasy, aw yeah
Borderline insanity, ah yeah
Driftin' in a fantasy, ooh
Borderline insanity, ooh
I'm driftin' in a fantasy

[Verse]
Offer my ego, I'm a facade
When I'm with you, I feel naked, it's like God
When I'm with you, I feel myself, I feel alive
Love when it's so many things I can't describe
I'm rollin' and it's so specific, twisted
It's important, do not be dismissive
You and me, it's like a new religion
I get so high, I come up missin'
I ain't keepin' score
You my only game
It's a love like this
I'm so committed, I be with it
Know we did some roses shit, but I forget it, ayy
I forget it, I relive it, ayy
I do the opposite and keep my distance, ayy

[Chorus]
'cause I'm driftin' in a fantasy, ooh
Losin' touch with sanity, like ooh
I'm driftin' in a fantasy, ooh
I'm losin' touch with sanity
I'm driftin' in a fantasy
