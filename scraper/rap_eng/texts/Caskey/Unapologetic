[Chorus]
Unapologetic
That's why I just had to dead it
You say it's love, but it's more like headache
I don't know where you think that we headed
But it's not where I'm headed, ayy

[Verse 1]
Yeah, why you always tell me that it's all good?
Just so you could throw me to the wayside
Say you never have time to fall through
Well there's never 'nough time, gotta make time

[Verse 2]
I can't keep, doin' the same thang
Somethin's goin' on with the mainframe
Why we never thrivin'? We just maintain
Said I don't listen when you speak, you do the same thang
Pride, keep on gettin' pushed to the side
Just so you could shit on me and tell another lie
There's gotta be another way for us to feel alive

[Bridge]
I gotta drift away, ayy, ayy
It's gonna hurt too much, if I try to stay, ayy, ayy
It make me feel so much like the enemy
I don't know what's got to end to me

[Chorus]
Unapologetic
That's why I just had to dead it
You say it's love, but it's more like headache
I don't know where you think that we headed
But it's not where I'm headed
