[Hook: Jalion & Caskey]
I'm out and up, out and up, out and up
I'm out and up, out and up, out and up
I'm out and up, I'm out and up once again
I'm out and up, out and up, fuck your friends
Countin' up, countin' up, countin' up
And you out of luck, out of luck, out of luck, yeah
I'm countin' up, countin' up, countin' up
And you out of luck, out of luck, out of luck, yeah

[Verse 1: Jalion]
Yeah, I'm out and up, I don't really give a fuck
Used to never play my stuff, now they all say "what's up?"
Tryin' to take my shinin' but, I ain't really mind it plus
I ain't really worried 'cause I am the one grindin', yup
I just graduated, everybody steady hated
Everybody looking jaded, everybody always fakin'
Run your mouth now, what the fuck is you sayin'?
You a gangster? How? What the fuck is you takin'?
OK, there you go again, talk that shit right behind my back
I just fucked your ho again, believe me, I don't lie 'bout that
You ain't even notice it, walk by, yeah, you still give me daps
I ain't sugarcoating shit, I am just stating all these facts

[Bridge: Jalion & Caskey]
Out and up, out and up
Out and up, out and up
Shitting on everybody just because, just because
Just be, just be, just because, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Jalion & Caskey]
I'm out and up, out and up, out and up
I'm out and up, out and up, out and up
I'm out and up, I'm out and up once again
I'm out and up, out and up, fuck your friends
Countin' up, countin' up, countin' up
And you out of luck, out of luck, out of luck, yeah
I'm countin' up, countin' up, countin' up
And you out of luck, out of luck, out of luck, yeah

[Verse 2: Caskey]
I'm in the cut, like the wound got infected, yeah
She wanna fuck, told her two contraceptives, yeah
I'm shitting on 'em, like I let loose the bowels
Don't be talking like I owe you something, I don't know those vowels
OK, the Maserati got so many horses, you'd think it's a race
My crib got so many stars inside it, you'd think we in space
My bitch is bad, bad like Angelina
You could tell we getting money now, just check my demeanor
You know I'm rich as fuck, like my kid play lacrosse
Got that Rick Owens inside my closet, don't do Lacoste
I'm in a foreign country, foreign bitch, don't care 'bout the cost
In the kitchen whipping still, yeah, I still got the sauce
My wrist gon' work, my phone gon' jump, my clientele is boomin'
I'm booted up, you got the boot, y'all ain't ever movin'
So many bitches in my phone, I swear I'm never choosin'
I'm in the winner's circle, and y'all forever losin'

[Hook: Jalion & Caskey]
I'm out and up, out and up, out and up
I'm out and up, out and up, out and up
I'm out and up, I'm out and up once again
I'm out and up, out and up, fuck your friends
Countin' up, countin' up, countin' up
And you out of luck, out of luck, out of luck, yeah
I'm countin' up, countin' up, countin' up
And you out of luck, out of luck, out of luck, yeah
