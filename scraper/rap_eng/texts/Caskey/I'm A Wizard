[Verse 1: Rhymer Real]
I see it on my face, right
I got all these questions in my mind
I'm feeling so high, I'm letting go
I could fly, I'm going to get mine
But first I need to know what it is I could find
Yeah, I didn't know much
And I didn't know what I knew 'til these lips when they touch
Like I'm kissing this crazy life and this mystery love
I'm a kid when it comes to growing up in this slum
By the way, you are borin' if you living life, ignorin'
What it is you really feel, follow your heart, now start scorin', man
Get those bills, one hundred million deals
There's a trillion stars, pick a thrill

[Chorus: Rhymer Real]
Oops-a-daisy
I think I'm going crazy
Baby, oh lady
I think I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
Yeah, I'm done with this shit, no politics, no
I could see the future
'cause I'm a wizard, and I can cast a spell on you

[Verse 2: Caskey]
I could see it through the lines
Tryin' to manuever times
I'm not one of these suit and ties
I'm in the sky and I'm stupid fly
I pick up the pieces, this life too cold to be beaches
I'm turned up on two pills, I hang with big meeches
Momma talk to me, say that I need Jesus
Grab one of them bibles, I'm too high to read this
I'm turnin', like my backwood, my soul burnin'
That fire in my eyes like it's magic, I'm Merlin
Ride through the city in blacked out suburbans
So much good and bad that I can't discern it
I'm feeling so high, yeah
I take a hit of indo and I drift into a place I can't define, yeah
And I been gone for too long, probably gon' be hard to find
And I know myself, know myself, so everything is fine
Had to take a look inside, 'cause it all start with the mind

[Chorus: Rhymer Real]
Oops-a-daisy
I think I'm going crazy
Baby, oh lady
I think I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
Yeah, I'm done with this shit, no politics, no
I could see the future
'cause I'm a wizard, and I can cast a spell on you

[Verse 3: Rhymer Real]
Tryna get it, what I picture from it
Is the past of knowledge, from the fallen prophets
Yeah, I seen my wallet, it has bigger pockets
You can hold me hostage, but my shoes, they polished
'cause I'm a walkin' wizard, only talkin' business
Yeah, I would bring a blizzard to keep it very merry Christmas
But I stay confused, when I reach my fuse
You see my super power, blowing on this country sour
Good or bad, I'm still me, with the same eyes, with the same mind
I'm tryna capture what I do see, this is real life, it's not play time
Living right or wrong, I do me, yeah, I still smile when I ya cryin'
I got the ice down, ice tea, with a touch of gin and some squeezed lime
I'm faded now
Yeah, I'm having my fun and I'm not coming down
I'm blazing up
With a middle finger in the sky, don't ask me why
