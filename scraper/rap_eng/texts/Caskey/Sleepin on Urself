[Chorus]
Man, that shit a shame
All that time you waste
Sleepin' on yourself
You the one to blame
I'm just amazed (what, ayy)
I go out the way (way)
Got no time to play
Only so much in a day
I'm goin' cray (cray, yeah)
Tryna touch a mill (mill)
Woke up out the bed
Don't give no fuck how they feel
I'm goin' cray (cray, ayy)
Got no time to play (play)
I go out the way (whoa)
She want call me bae

[Verse]
That ain't my bae (my bae, ayy)
She just want the K (K)
I'm not new to this
I got stupid on my face
Ain't no way (no way)
I came way too hard to stray (stray)
This just what we want
This ain't too much on my plate
At the bank (yeah, ayy)
I smell just like some dank (woo!)
I'm my own damn boss
Don't give no fucks what you think
That's on gang (that's on gang, ayy)
But stay in your lane (lane)
This not what you claim (claim)
You can't ride the train
Ride the train (ride the train)
Off of the stage, my bitch is exotic (exotic)
I scooped her, she came out of Onyx
Smokin' so much that they think I'm the pilot
Gang (gang, whoa)
I be a lot of things, but never dishonest (honest)
I'm a boss and a pimp and I'm modest (ay)
But the bitch that I fuck is a goddess
Gang (wait, oh)
It's so hard
Take a look at this generation
Know where it goes (how it grows)
Five in the mornin'
Startin' to feel, startin' to feel, like

[Chorus]
Like, man, that shit a shame (shame, yeah)
All that time you waste
Sleepin' on yourself (self)
You the one to blame
I'm amazed (amazed)
I go out the way (way)
Got no time to play (play)
Only so much in a day
Goin' cray (goin' cray, yeah)
Tryna touch a mill (mill)
Know just who I am
Don't give no fuck how they feel
That's on gang (that's on gang, yeah)
Tryna get the K (K)
She want call me bae (ayy)
But that ain't my bae
That's on gang

[Outro]
Ha, yeah, that's on gang
