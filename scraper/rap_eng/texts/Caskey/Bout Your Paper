[Intro: Caskey]
Know me from Cali to Bed-Stuy, yeah
Motherfucking Phix and Caskey, bitch (Supreme)
Yeah, Supreme on the beat, yeah, okay
If you ain't 'bout your paper, don't know where the fuck you from

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Ay, running up the fucking bands
Bitch, I got the day-date on the wrist
Everyday I'm plated with the chips
They screaming "mayday" when it hits
I made a payday with the wrist
Came to the west side
You comfortable when the dead rise
You made your home in apartments
But I feel at home when the jet flys
I got killers telling me to go
(I got killers telling me to go)
Started this amatuer, but now it's pro, yeah
(Amatuer but now it's pro)
I made a couple thousand at the stove
But off of music, I done turned a whole
That's shit they know like we in Hollygrove
We gotta get it 'fore we getting old
We in the city, bitches getting chose
I got some pretty women on they toes
Bag full of molly made me overdose
We come alive, they say we cut it close, yeah
We come alive, they say we cut it close, yeah
We go to war, we got a hunnid scopes
Okay, just jumped out into Vegas, dope ain't payin' our wages
Started with a bag full of pills, now we killing on stages
People say they coming for the spot, that shit so outrageous
This shit one for the ages, we got coke like the eighties

[Bridge: Caskey]
And I just pulled up in the Benzo
That's my lil hiatus
We spread so much love 'round the city
How the fuck they gon' hate us?
Swear that they forever jaded
And they shit is going plated
They just salty that we made it
I just did a 180

[Chorus: Phix]
If you ain't 'bout your paper, I don't know where the fuck you from
I get that shit by me making hits, I'm tryna be number one
And no matter what, I don't sleep until I see the sun
Every move I make for money, I don't do this shit for fun
If you ain't 'bout your paper, I don't know where the fuck you from
I get that shit by me making hits, I'm tryna be number one
And no matter what, I don't sleep until I see the sun
Every move I make for money, I don't do this shit for fun

[Verse 2: Phix]
Turn it up and break the knob off
More lit up than you drinking hot sauce
And this shit be so flame when they go and pull us over
That I drop the windows and cops run
Fuck with this [?]
While I do a hunnid with the top off
All she wanna do is just talk 'bout the rock
But everytime she do, then I nod off
I'm with your bitch who don't tell me to stop
Richie Rich, I'm the new kid on the block
Gold on my wrist, I got cash on the clock
Diamonds be dancing on knuckles I pop
Fuck did you thought?
I don't mind if you like it or not
Keep to yourself with your thoughts
Or you winding up hit on the spot, yeah
If you ain't gonna party then it's best to go
Homie, I know
I'm colder than weather an eskimo knows
Know that I got it
Only drink in the freezer don't ever get frozen
I crack it open when I'm through with smokin'
And I ain't jokin', I'm in one of those modes

[Bridge: Phix]
I'm all about it and you not
I been around, fuck you thought?
Came from the bottom to the top
Juggin' when I hit the spot
Ain't make it here to date a thot
Don't need the time to wear it out
Give it everything I got
And fuck anyone who I doubt

[Chorus: Phix]
If you ain't 'bout your paper, I don't know where the fuck you from
I get that shit by me making hits, I'm tryna be number one
And no matter what, I don't sleep until I see the sun
Every move I make for money, I don't do this shit for fun
If you ain't 'bout your paper, I don't know where the fuck you from
I get that shit by me making hits, I'm tryna be number one
And no matter what, I don't sleep until I see the sun
Every move I make for money, I don't do this shit for fun
