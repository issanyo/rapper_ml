[Chorus]
So if you wanna take a ride, put your windows up
Gotta hold it down, this is tinted up
I'm riding slow, grab my fo', I could give a fuck
This is to ride in my city and the fire coming with me
If you wanna take a ride, put your windows up
Gotta hold it down, this is tinted up
I'm riding slow, grab my fo', blow the indo up
This is to ride in my city and the fire coming with me

[Verse 1]
I'm laid back, gripping trace and I'm blown, pulling my 7 and zone
Copping a dutch from the sto', 7Eleven that's home
My mac-11 is gone, while I be packing these songs
Until [?] could bring light to your dome
I'm sitting strong inside Maxine, my tinted, black queen
My stacks gleam, accident where I'm last seen in
Sitting lowkey, from Springs to Bokey
And my license been restricted, so I hope I don't see police
But shit, they tend to know me, I'm an [?] homie
Got a reputation, a lot of love, a lot of hate and
Lot of meditatin', rubber bands and paper chasin'
Elevated thinkin', a lot of drama like the Pacers
So I cruise on land in my city where the scandalous are
Handling grown folk shit, oh man, is it [?]
This is the problem that this life bring
And every nice thing stained [?]

[Chorus]
So if you wanna take a ride, put your windows up
Gotta hold it down, this is tinted up
I'm riding slow, grab my fo', I could give a fuck
This is to ride in my city and the fire coming with me
If you wanna take a ride, put your windows up
Gotta hold it down, this is tinted up
I'm riding slow, grab my fo', blow the indo up
This is to ride in my city and the fire coming with me

[Verse 2]
Y'all steady watching it, I've been on the move, spitting jewels to your metropolis
You flopped, really hating while you spotting this
[?] I beast the mic, see, I could speak it right
Wondering how these fake ass homies learn how to sleep at night
I penetrated the scene clean, juvenile status
Push and changing the game, mane, I'm below the stratus
When I had in, served the addicts and dopers
Know the faggots who spoke with these sheisty women in chokers
[?] sitting beside me
We used to dip out of class to get Bacardi with hash
Getting retarded, shit get started [?] dash
I never blow the chase, running from Jakes, no mistakes
Only growing up where these peeps are so fake
And still I kept forward, pushing past these fake ass styles
It's wild, the type of shit to get [?] dragging for miles
Your brother lay low, pocket full of dutches and something inside
Light it up and take to this ride

[Chorus]
So if you wanna take a ride, put your windows up
Gotta hold it down, this is tinted up
I'm riding slow, grab my fo', I could give a fuck
This is to ride in my city and the fire coming with me
If you wanna take a ride, put your windows up
Gotta hold it down, this is tinted up
I'm riding slow, grab my fo', blow the indo up
This is to ride in my city and the fire coming with me
