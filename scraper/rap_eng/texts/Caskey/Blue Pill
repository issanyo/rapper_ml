[Hook: ChadThePilot]
I just took a blue pill, blue pill
Couple Xannies, got 'em to chill, to chill
My clique, boy, they too real, too real
We got pockets full of blue bills, blue bills

[Verse 1: ChadThePilot]
Look, just know it ain't nothing to kill the whole damn game
Caught the whole damn thang, tatted all up with a gold ass chain
Hoes on me, they know my name, hit that thang, they go insane
Whoa, whoa, homie, I just made the news, stacked it up and paid my due
I see you been acting cool, but fake as fuck, what's up with you?
Cut 'em off, it's nothing new, see 'em buzzing on the net
I'ma knock him offline, couple diamonds on my neck
And I rock 'em all the time when I'm running up a check

[Hook: ChadThePilot]
I just took a blue pill, blue pill
Couple Xannies, got 'em to chill, to chill
My clique, boy, they too real, too real
We got pockets full of blue bills, blue bills

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Yeah, quarter million worth of blues in my troubs
I'm lit like a fuse, my dog, Chad, just made the news
VVS my diamonds, put my necklace on a cruise
Beamer, Benz, or Lambo, not sure which one I should choose
Yeah, peanut butter inside, outside jelly
"Thug Life" on the belly, drug dealers on the celly
Stripper hoes at the telly, we don't know they name, calling 'em Kelly
Now she sucking on somebody dick and then I'm calling her Becky
Pistol on my hip, I love when I draw it, it make 'em feel sketchy
Twenty thousand all in big faces, for the paper, shit, I'm impatient
Lawsuit type of money in my bank account, but I never win cases
Yeah, my bitches going big places
Got so many dead white people in my pocket that I feel a lil racist
The bank deposit where I feel the safest

[Hook: ChadThePilot]
I just took a blue pill, blue pill
Couple Xannies, got 'em to chill, to chill
My clique, boy, they too real, too real
We got pockets full of blue bills, blue bills

[Verse 3: ChadThePilot]
But I got like fifty grand
So pass the ball, got them Pippen hands
I'm slapping hoes, these them pimpin' hands
Rocking shows, they in the stands, got the blueprints
So these the plans, now me and Cas, we smoking gas
Circle small, so we don't pass
Roll one up and we gon' match
Going broke, but that come last
Stack it up and spend it fast
We throwing ones and slapping ass 'cause

[Hook: ChadThePilot]
I just took a blue pill, blue pill
Couple Xannies, got 'em to chill, to chill
My clique, boy, they too real, too real
We got pockets full of blue bills, blue bills
