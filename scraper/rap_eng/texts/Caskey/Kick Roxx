[Hook: Keez]
I been down for so long, how could I not?
I done seen the bottom, the only thing left is the top
If it's not about the Rolls, time to kick rocks
And if that hoe ain't fucking, tell that lil bitty, "Kick rocks"
I been down for so long, how could I not?
I done seen the bottom, the only thing left is the top
If it's not about the Rolls, time to kick rocks
And if that hoe ain't fucking, tell that lil bitty, "Kick rocks"

[Verse 1: Keez]
I hit a couple stains for O's and never got caught
I hit some undercover hoes and never got caught
I hit that robot bitch [?] spot
When I told her she had to go, she act like she was lost
I feel like Yeezy, damn, I'm 'bout to go on a rant
I don't wanna talk, unless it's 'bout them bands, damn
I'm gon' do this for all the people that said that I can't
[?] family, I'ma rock out with my band
They cannot stand with me, those hoes know that I'm the man
They tried to ban me but [?] back
Don't try to tag because I'll come, take the whole sack
You tried to tag me, but I just ran off with that pack

[Hook: Keez]
I been down for so long, how could I not?
I done seen the bottom, the only thing left is the top
If it's not about the Rolls, time to kick rocks
And if that hoe ain't fucking, tell that lil bitty, "Kick rocks"
I been down for so long, how could I not?
I done seen the bottom, the only thing left is the top
If it's not about the Rolls, time to kick rocks
And if that hoe ain't fucking, tell that lil bitty, "Kick rocks"
Tell that lil bitty, "Kick rocks," yeah

[Verse 2: Danny Towers]
I been balling so hard, I been balling like a Maverick
My jewelry retarded, look at my neck, it is Lazareth
I took her to party, let her hang out with the savages
I took her to mall, my shooters be posted on [?]
I been balling so hard, I been balling like a Maverick
My jewelry retarded, look at my neck, it is Lazareth
I took her to party, let her hang out with the savages
I took her to mall, my shooters be posted on [?]
You know DT be moving the dope

She say DT be doing the most

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Suck on my dick till you choke
They gonna hit on the blunt when I like but they don't want no smoke
The chopper beside me, 'cause I bet they won't
I'ma go wet the whole party up, bust off in somebody throat
I'm goin' for the kill, on shrooms, over to pills
Forty on side my waist, I caught this shit over the hill
I just hit a lick, 42nd, I don't need a deal
I just poured the four, don't let it spill

[Outro: Caskey]
'Cause I been down for so long, how can I not?
Just fucked the bitch on top the bed and knots
I been down for so long, how could I not? My wrist in the pot
I don't give a fuck what they think, man, I'm fucking a lot
I been down for so long, how can I not?
I just fucked the bitch on top the bed and knots
I been down for so long, how could I not? My wrist in the pot
I don't give a fuck what they think, man, I'm fucking a lot
