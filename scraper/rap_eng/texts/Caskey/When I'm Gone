[Intro]
I been thinkin bout it all the time
When I'm gone will they mourn me?
When I'm gone will they mourn me?
I think about it all the time
When I'm gone will they mourn me?

[Verse]
Man I been thinkin' bout my pops back in '89
Like how you work two jobs and say he fine
Knowin' damn well he movin' coke on the side
Countin bags and hopin he thrive
I feel it so deep inside
The pain of bearin' a child and it ain't like nobody dies
So you coppin' extra guns, walkin' with army knives
Thoughts of losin' her and you can't look in her mommy eyes
Three bodies hit my house tried rapin' my momma
They high off angel dust
You ran to the crib, did what an angel must
Popped the shotgun in their chest, my city dangerous
But we didnâ€™t worry because you came with us
16 years of survival you was my idol
Now Im on bridges and standing idle
In a world full of minor disputes over the title and
I just want our connection back that was vital
You ain't ever seen no grown man cry
Until he start reflectin' back on Christmas time
When you and Amanda came back from the truck
And yall was sniffin' lines
It fuck with me knowing that you ain't shit sometimes!
And everybody carry demons
You was suppose to be the God who brought faith to the odds now we just even
And Im inside my room grievin'
Some of your actions got me questionin' everything I believe in
Wheres God when you need him?

[Outro]
I spent so many years of my life as a child out here callin' for meaning
And you ain't ever pick up the calls or receive 'em and
I'm strugglin' with all Im believing in
When I'm gone will they mourn me?
I think about it all the time
When I'm gone will they mourn me?
