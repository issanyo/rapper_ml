[Verse 1]
Lock that door and throw away the
Key, it's best for both us if you
Leave me here in solitary
I don't deal with things like this too well

[Refrain]
This love got a hold on me

[Verse 2]
Lock that door and throw away the
Key, it's best for you and I if
I don't see the outside of these
Four walls, 'cause in time I'll hear myself

[Refrain]
This love got a hold on me
This love got a hold on me

[Verse 3]
Fell asleep inside your arms, I
Woke up in a field of fire
I can't help but smile when I
Think about all the irony

[Refrain]
This love got a hold on me

[Verse 4]
Woke up in a field of fire
Wished that I was in your arms
I can't help but smile when I
Think about all the irony

[Refrain]
This love got a hold on me
