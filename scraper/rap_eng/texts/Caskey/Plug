[Pre-Hook: J Holben]
They don't know how it was, we was out here selling dubs
Took the work and ran it up, we ran it up, now look at us
Now the plug call me plug, now the plug call me plug
Now the plug call me plug, now the plug call me plug

[Hook: J Holben]
Now the plug call me plug, now the plug call me plug
Now the plug call me plug, now the plug call me plug
They don't know how it was, started off selling dubs
Now the plug call me plug, now the plug call me plug

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Started selling drugs, turned my half an ounce into a whole bag
Jumped off the porch, yeah, told my mama that I won't fail
I've been slanging iron, all my folks want me retirin'
But that money feed the fire, I go get what we desire
They don't know how it was (nah), I was down at 33rd (ay)
I was caged like a bird (ay), I was tryna get referred (yeah)
I was tryna get servin', in the house of the streets, I am not a virgin
Left out in the white hoopty, came back, black suburban
Hitting them licks, I'm the one get all the money 'cause I'm taking the risks
I'm in the sticks, I went and bought me a Rollie 'cause how I been working my wrist
Money my bitch, money my bitch, they don't know how it was
Was nine when I served my first eight ball and now they calling me the plug

[Pre-Hook: J Holben]
They don't know how it was, we was out here selling dubs

Now the plug call me plug, now the plug call me plug

[Hook: J Holben]
Now the plug call me plug, now the plug call me plug
Now the plug call me plug, now the plug call me plug

Now the plug call me plug, now the plug call me plug

[Verse 2: J Holben]
Now you know the plug, 20K and the jug
White Metro the plug, for the low for the love
Tryna get money off this rappin' shit, fuck these fans tryna catch me traffickin'
I don't know 'em then I'm taxin' them, they in my lane, bet I'm passin' them
This that shit that I've waited on, all my life, I've been hated on
Getting cash that I preyed upon, now five star filet mignon
Now I'm MJ, you Lebron, think you the king but you just a pawn
I re-upped it 'fore the pack is gone, I got mo' grass than a lawn
I take a trip out to Cali, good OG come from the valley, I send it straight to your Audi
Switch and twist it, that's a fatty, she got a ass which is fatty
South bitch and she calling me daddy, I just bought her some new Bally, you not a plug, you a Sally
I just heard that you only plug with the federalis (what?!)

[Pre-Hook: J Holben]

[Verse 3: J Holben]
They never knew how it was, they never batted no bud
I was out here selling .8s for the dub, now I'm out in Cali and they show me love
All these different growers wanna be a plug, all these different strains, all this different nug (all of it, all of it)
I got choices when it comes to trappin' (I got 'em, I got 'em)
They call me for Ls and they call me for zips, I do it all, I'm a jack of all trades
But I do not trade, only bring cash, 100 dollar bills is all I fuck with
Rolling up that gas is all I fuck with, po' a fo', I just popped a seal
Only fucking with you if you real, shout out Caskey, time to get these mills
Why you caught up in the struggle? What you know about the hustle?
Y'all don't know about the come up, grindin' all night 'til the sun up
Every minute get my funds up, what you gon' do if they run up?
You gon' give it up or put your gun up?

[Pre-Hook: J Holben]
They don't know how it was, we was out here selling dubs

[Hook: J Holben]
