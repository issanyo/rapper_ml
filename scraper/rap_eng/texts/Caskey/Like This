[Intro: Gwalla]
Black market, open right now, you already know it

Everything you need, we got it right now, han
My niggas got it like this

[Hook: Gwalla]

[Verse 1: Gwalla]
My niggas like to cook up the dope
Fish scale and it really came off the boat
Got a couple homies doing time up the road
And I got they kids who didn't make it home
I know some shooters up for the challenge
Hit ya long distance like Ray Allen
My young niggas is savages, broad day blocking off traffic
My snow bunnies is ratchet, set ya up for that package
All black, mobbed out, head to toe, strapped up in the plastic
I got homies that done changed and we don't kick it no mo'
For my ex-bitch, I be flexin', just to piss off that ho
My homies po' up them folks, my homies rep for the five
We don't take kindly to threats, we just put prices on heads
I know you niggas upset, 'cause we stay counting them checks
And my team had the respect you wish you could do it like this

[Verse 2: Pablo EscaBear]
Word on the streets, I got beef
Some fuck niggas say I ain't [?]
Late night with the stick I creep
Catch yo' ass, let you get gunned down
More pressure, I ain't playing, I'm hot
Now the cracker on the book wanna box
Keep fucking 'round, keep fucking 'round
Keep fucking 'round and get shot
Now I'm riding 'round with my Glock, that AK in the back seat
You playing checkers, I gotta eat, two 23s with the red beam
That bullshit, I'm with it, shoot until it start clickin'
Hoes bopping like Diddy, play the game like I'm cheatin'
My trap open like Denny's, two gold medals, I'm winnin'
Mama, pray for me, I'm sinnin', finally made it out of these trenches
Been saving up for my pension, got Nina Ross with the dick on her
That's Caitlyn for you bitches, ain't no Bruce, bih

[Hook: Gwalla]
My homeboys be flexing like this

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Still got work stashed at the house
Still got hoes giving that mouth
Still no outlaws in this stout
I could still eyeball me a ounce
Still no strippers doing that bounce
Still been pimpin', move my accounts
Oversea banks are where they stay
Bitch, you a check, you know what that's 'bout
Got three hoes licking on titties
Thank God, hoes licking on titties
I bought the drop top to the city
Soon as I pop, they hopping out, pretty
Got the whole squad, yep, they all with me
Nothing change but the address
On one, life too short, for being sober and bad sex
I swear, I dodged so many bullets, know that God blessed me
I touch down in so many cities, should've got an Espy
My team in so much black at night
The streets, they call us "Wesley"
Don't come here flexing with them jewels
That shit, that don't impress me
I been on a pill; invincible, feel like they can't arrest me
Get so much pussy, all that online hate shit don't depress me
She want a threesome so we pop one, told her call her bestie
On that note, I been fucking both them, still they won't ingest me
