Our love was supposed to be prepared for the worst
But when the worst came
Our preparations were like sand to the rain
More pain than false smiles can restrain
More at a loss for words that any amount of poetry I write could gain
Faced with the loss of where I found it
My face often hides but, like all good things this life can bring
Our love withered away and died

I've been asleep for too long, let me wake up
She right beside me, applying her make-up
Don't want me to see her raw, she like a fish out of water
Meanwhile I picture all this shit that I bought her
I mean, that wasn't for outer appearances only
That just shows me your concerns and how little you know me
I swear we used to be like one and the same
Then I slipped up, lately nothing's the same
She at me why I always give up, I got nothing to say
Look, you are not my religion, bitch
I know we get intimate but you could get x'ed out
I can get ignorant, my heart got barricades
And you are lookin militant, well I am apparently blazed
You stand there like Mona Lisa, frozen with your straight face on
How do I reach her?
To be honest our conversations are quite rude
And lately I just say I like you

Cause I don't know what love is
You can show me, maybe you can show me
I don't know what love is
Maybe you can show me, maybe you can show me
I don't know what love is
You can show me, maybe you can show me
I don't know what love is
You can show me, maybe you can show me

I've been asleep for too long, peaceful, strong
Deceitful, is it wrong?
I'm not the most compassionate lover
I am grown but I'm a child at heart
This bitch don't ever leave me alone
She get wildin and start yelling 'bout my timing
Like I got the worst fucking timing
It's a curse to be as distant as I
When I say the things that will make her, cease her smiling
I used to be the kindest, my father passed away
And now lately I'm being honest, I'm an asshole
Is it bad, though? Nice guys never last, though
White guy with a black girl, why you bringing up that for?
I exit through the back door, she opened up through her text messages
My heart is a black hole, lost, yeah girl, get lost
This here is a lone road, the GPS is off
Pissed off, why you always pissed off?
Did I say something? Did we lift off?
You're so far away and it's so hard to play these so called love games
One thing that must change is these lies that I see right through
So lately I just say I like you

Cause I don't know what love is
You can show me, maybe you can show me
I don't know what love is
Maybe you can show me, maybe you can show me
I don't know what love is
You can show me, maybe you can show me
I don't know what love is
You can show me, maybe you can show me
