[Intro]
Uh
Blowin' gas every day mafucka
I'm getting ass every day mafucka

[Verse 1]
You know why?
Feels good to be eating
Lately everything bone lickin
I don't share that shit with hoes I share it with strong women
They waitin for you to bite
They tell me they've gone fishin
I'm bumpin your tape
Tell you what every song missing
Talent and drive
You don't got dedication
And none the shit you droppin in real
Animation
I was in the car with two white boys and a haitian
And we getting to that dirty ass money contamination
I got drugs in a ziplock bag. Lamination
And I meditate to wipe off the hate. Sanitation
Ain't you tell me you was fixin to pop? Cancellation
Haha ! use that shit as motivation motherfucker that’s paramount

[Hook]
Fuck the bullshit Ima air it out
I'm high, that’s my whereabouts
I'm countin an unfair amount
We getting to the money motherfucker that’s Paramount

All my kush loud motherfucker that’s Paramount
All my girls bad motherfucker that’s Paramount
Better show respect motherfucker I'm paramount
We getting to the money motherfucker that’s paramount

Blowin gas every day mafucka
I'm getting ass every day mafucka

[Verse 2]
Swear every time I'm online motherfuckers stay on me
Its like they ain't got nothing else to do but to hate on me
I went through out your neighborhood and had like 20k on me
And still ain't get the K on me
You pussy and you know it
Tryna prey on me
I'm at the top the food fucking chain
It weigh on me thinking how infatuated you are with another man
I think some of my haters turning gay on me
Ima call you Naomi
I’ll lay you pussys out you try and lay on me
I'm in the streets blowing up gas
FUCK THE COPS
Fuck your friend in front of me, cuz its fun to watch
Look we done rolled up 20 j’s took 100 shots
Cuz my team winnin' tell 'em run the clocks
Man that shit paramount
