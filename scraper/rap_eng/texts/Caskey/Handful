[Chorus: L-Roy]
She a motherfucking handful
Told her hop up on my lap and bust a dance move
Shorty want the dick, I wonder if her man knew
Yeah, next time she gonna bring her fucking friend too
Slap that ass and now I got myself a handful
A handful, talking 'bout a fucking handful
Getting money, grab the handfuls
Handfuls, motherfucker got them handfuls, yeah, throw it up

[Verse 1: L-Roy]
Damn, this bitch is bad, I wonder if she know it
Get her ass alone and now she 'bout to show it
She say she wanna have sex with a poet
So you know I fucked that bitch until her pussy broken
Fuck the games, I don't play charades
But I know a couple bad bitches that get down with foreplay
She just like my music, so we jammin' while we slammin'
And this girl is super tight, she got me busting like a cannon, uh
She call me on the phone just about every night
So I pick her up, roll a blunt, sipping dirty sprite
She like it when I bite her lip, man, she get freaky
I give her good dick, so she wanna keep me
But I ain't starting no relationship
Always nag 'bout this and that, man, I really hate that shit
Tryna go all through my phone, what the fuck you think this is?
I don't care if you are curious, stay out my fucking business
My money long up in the digits
Yeah, I am the fittest even though I'm skinny, pulling bitches
Her life may seem dismantled
But that pussy sweet and she a motherfucking handful

[Chorus: L-Roy]
Told her hop up on my lap and bust a dance move
Shorty want the dick, I wonder if her man knew
Yeah, next time she gonna bring her fucking friend too
Slap that ass and now I got myself a handful
A handful, talking 'bout a fucking handful
Getting money, grab the handfuls
Handfuls, motherfucker got them handfuls, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Okay, if beating up the pussy was a sport, I'd be in first place
Never met a bitch who tried to stop me short of first base
They always bring me home, getting dome is just the worst case
I fuck her, she gon' always get the O, like my birthplace
Redbone sitting on my lap, that my side piece
Eight bitches and I got 'em trippin' off the nine piece
Time is money and my time expensive than my timepiece
I popped a Xanny bar, bring my mind peace
Jugging off the bars, in my own world, don't advise me
I fuck her twice and never call, she despise me
He talked that shit, I rolled on him, like where the tides be?
Baby called me up, we had to sit down, then he hired me
Now I got the freaky bitches giving me the sloppy
In the hotel lobby, starting to feel like Ricky Bobby
Why? All my hoes on track, I think I'm on fire
That boy said I wasn't winning, man, that boy a liar
Dipped up out the Ritz and grabbed my condoms for a threesome
Saw a rich man when I was five, said I'ma be one
I got the pistol, never know when you gon' need one
I eat the pussy, like the shit you turnin' when police come, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: L-Roy]
Come by the fucking handful
Getting money, grabbing handfuls
Handfuls, motherfucker got them handfuls

[Chorus: L-Roy]
Motherfucking handful
Told her hop up on my lap and bust a dance move
Shorty want the dick, I wonder if her man knew
Yeah, next time she gonna bring her fucking friend too
Slap that ass and now I got myself a handful
Come by the fucking handful
Grabbing handfuls
Handfuls, motherfucker got them handfuls, yeah

[Outro: L-Roy & Caskey]
It's hard
Yeah, that one was hard, I liked that one
