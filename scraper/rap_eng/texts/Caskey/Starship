[Intro]
Hop up out the coupe, interestin'
Too many bad hoes, up in my section
Cristal all on her body, talk 'bout caressin'
We get this money, ain't worried 'bout XXL Freshman

[Chorus]
I'm next in, my dough go up, we don't want less than
Pour more liquor, blessins, that dollar sign my best friend
We need no investments, my 'migos taught me lessons
Keep that Smith & Wesson, all this shit was destined

[Verse 1]
Tryna trump my shine like I just won this whole election
So how I finessed it? My car just like the Jetsons'
This ride is infectious, my diamonds got reflections
Know my competition made it, this not your selection
Y'all gon' fake to front the story, he don't need no inspection
Hustle every second, I keep that lethal weapon
So high on the pill right now, I got some bad reception
Change your whole direction, immaculate conception

[Pre-Chorus]
Wear my checks in, just checked in
Run to best friend, might need my best friend
Y'all just checked out, we just checked in
Got my checks in, this perfection

[Chorus]
I'm next in, my dough go up, we don't want less than
Pour more liquor, blessins, that dollar sign my best friend
We need no investments, my 'migos taught me lessons
Keep that Smith & Wesson, all this shit was destined

[Verse 2]
Roll rock shit, real rock star shit
Out this world like I just came down on a starship
Four door car shit, solo boss shit
Roll down Slauson, trap out with precaution
I'm like a martian, touch down, I've been saucin', drive like Monte Carlo
Drug dealer cargo, hit the mall 'cause there ain't no tomorrow
Slow to borrow, pour my sorrow, hit the liquor, swallow
I'm in Key Largo with a bad bitch, tryna hit Wells Fargo
Ayy, what's my motto? Make ya own life, there ain't none to follow
Get rich like Ralo, turn your two cents into twenty dollars
Pour out the bottles, diamonds water, I got money goggles
Whole crib remodeled, I start the bike then grip the throttle

[Pre-Chorus]
Checked in, got my checks in
Run the check in, might need my best friend
Y'all just checked out, we just checked in
Got my checks in, this perfection

[Chorus 2]
Ain't no restin', Smith & Wesson
Money destined, all this shit was destined (On God)
Ain't no restin', might need my best friend
Run them checks in, this was destined

[Outro]
The function of a performing philosopher is not to try to sell you on any brand name and philosophy. I have no dogma, I have no um, certain cause here. My one cause — and that's the goal of a performing philosopher — is to encourage you and um, inspire you and um, empower you — to the extent I can — to think for yourself and question authority
