[Intro]
[Multiple television commercial ads)

Just another ad for ya
Everything bad for ya
Sociology, uh

[Bridge]
Just another ad for ya
Everything bad for ya
We done had enough of that (x3)

[Verse 1]
Ya let the television develop my vision
This one hell of a prison
That i am standing inside
Capitalism, capitalizing on my condition
Every time these ads circulate i'm making decisions
Of being taught what to choose (chu')
Being taught to consume (ya)
Fear is all they ever promote inside of the news
And i'm confused with they motives
Defused with the bogus
And locusts inside the fear that ain't necessary to grow with
I got family at home
Everybody need the newest shit that's coming on
They are coming on to me
Like a tour bus groupie
Try'na hop inside my hoopty
On the low
They thinkin' the life i'm in is a movie
They are programmed
Writin' from the land there is no man
Bumpin' Nasty Nas and some slow jams
My eyes on the Lohans and the coke cans
These commericals enticin'
They the start to the circle inviting me to/o

[Chorus]
Keep your eyes on the screen
Watch everything, watch, watch everything
Watch everything, watch everything (x4)

[Bridge] (x2)

[Verse 2]
It's sociology (ya)
Someone owe me an apology
I usually ain't concern with they policy
But honesty this fee rottin' my whole mainframe
It's like i gotta purchase just so i can maintain
What's the verdict on life
Are we to be appraised and then forgotten
Then why we always got to be slave to someone's pocket
Decide is you gon' live a life consumin' materials
Or be the one who could stop it
(Commercial ads)

[Chorus] (x4)

[Bridge]

[Outro]
(Enlightenment)
