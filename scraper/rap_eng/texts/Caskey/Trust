[Intro]
Don’t trust nobody
Trust nobody (x3)

[Verse 1]
Uh. Tell me what you know about fame
(what you know about fame?)
I'm only calling 'bout checks
Folks only calling up me when their wanting the same
I feel like nothings the same
I'm sending a text on a plane (its to Bird!)
My mind on my money so much this promoter must think I'm insane
I put my eye to the scope of the chopper and aim. BAP!
Cuz I don’t really trust nobody
Ya'll better learn to chill don’t wanna bust nobody
No nobody!
I'm trying to cope with these changes
But folks I been down with since day 1 treat me like a stranger
Now you in danger

[Hook]
Me I can't put my finger on what you would say
If I compared your ways to how they used to be
They say they want none. Really want some
When I ain't pickin up my phone know it just ain't you

Look I don’t trust none of yall
Don’t trust nobody (x3)
I don’t trust none of yall
Don’t trust nobody (x3)

I DON’T WANNA TRUST NOBODY!
Can't trust nobody! Ain't feeling these hoes
Ain't feeling these playas
I don't wanna trust nobody!
Swear I don't trust nobody
(Can't trust nobody)
Swear I don't trust nobody)
I don't wanna trust nobody!

I been had the juice!
I'm back once again and got nothing to lose but got something to prove man
So ya'll better move!
I don't trust none of you boys but you know Im the truth
And I'm the numero uno in this motherfucker I'm never gone settle for deuce!
I'm breaking loose!
Yall better duck I been sippin that goose
And I come to make war not a truce
Fuck who they feelin'!
Fuck who they bumpin'
I'll hang that shit up by a noose
Man I swear I'll kill all of these rappers with this tape alone
Everything written in stone and I got it
They say they come for the throne but I doubt it
I never go nowhere without it
Lil homie we bout it
Ah!

[Hook]
