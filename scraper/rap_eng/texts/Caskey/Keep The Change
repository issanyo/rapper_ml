[Verse 1]
Here I go again, I back out
The driveway on Fridays, I blackout
Too many bars I know they only talk about my scars
But I doubt they ever see the pain when riding in these cars
That I'm in the backseat of
Fifteen feet up, my ambition, the heater
Somebody gotta keep me level-headed
I was beat up in middle school for everything while I read up
I wonder what my hometown would be without a leader
Shit, most of them ain't got change for the meter
Tell your home girl wish I could meet her, but I got a girl at home
And I've been working on bettering our relationshit
It frustrate me when they tell me
To invest my time into all these hoes, they just hoes
I've seen them on the internet a million times fold
But they tryna put me in a blindfold
And I'm tryna bring light to 'em, light to 'em

I mean, I'm tryna bring life to 'em
And why they always giving me advice? Ya know, like
About my principles and shit I'm doing, like
Like I don't know, fuck 'em

[Bridge 1]
What's a man without some principles to stand by?
A good girl beat a bad bitch by a landslide
They'll never know about your life through a three minute song
So when you gotta tell 'em leave ya alone, they'll take it wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
They always try to fuck with me
They always try to fuck with me
I'm on the interstate road, doing 150
With all the memories that's stuck with me

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna live life, I'm just tryna live life
Man, I'm just tryna live life
Everybody got they two cent for me
But don't ever wanna do shit for me, y'all can keep yo' change
'cause I'm just tryna live life
Man, I'm just tryna live life
Everybody got they two cent for me
But don't ever wanna do shit for me, y'all can keep yo' change

[Verse 2]
Coming up from a seed to a grown human bein', that is a blessin'
An opportunity to make cheese, that's a blessin'
All this hatin' on me that's depressin', like damn
What the fuck did I do to deserve a brick coming straight through my window?
Somebody riddle me that
Lately, I roll around literally strapped
Like somebody gon' come give me daps, pull out the gat, blat blat!
Another story cut short, mane
My homies be like, "What for, mane?"
Shit, hope my funeral more alive than usual
You could feel the energy my soul brang
It's like I get on every track with the soul train
Nowadays, they don't wanna hear you rap without the gold chain
So I pull out the one my father left for me
And try to give 'em a taste of my story, man, his last words were:

[Bridge 1]
What's a man without some principles to stand by?
A good girl beat a bad bitch by a landslide
They'll never know about your life through a three minute song
So when you gotta tell 'em leave ya alone, they'll take it wrong

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3]
They probably think my life was a walk in the park
They don't see the pain that I shed for the art
They don't see the long days I was there in the dark
Lights cut off
Gas bill too, and that's shut off
I'm sick of taking cold ass showers
I swear, that shit gets to your core
It's like, the fuck are you doing this for if you ain't got no power?
This rap shit is like a job that got no hours
If you ain't got a relevant buzz going on at the time
I know some underground cats gon' hate me because I signed
But it's like, what should I have done let my momma grind forever?
I'm just tryna spend time together
Pay the bills when we dine together
Make her pockets so straight that she fine forever
If y'all can't feel that, well then, the fuck are we talking for? Bitch

[Bridge 2]
And what's a man without some principles to stand by?
A good girl beat a bad bitch by a landslide
They'll never know about my life in this five minute song
So when you analyze, leave me alone and get gone

[Pre-Chorus]
They always try and fuck with me
But I'd never let 'em fuck with me
I'm on the interstate road, doing 150
With all the memories that's stuck with me

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna live life, live life, word up, ay
I'm just tryna live life, live life, word up, word up
I'm just tryna live life, live life
I'm just tryna live life
This for those who got they two cent for me
But don't ever wanna do shit for me, y'all can keep yo' change

[Outro]
Quit fuckin' callin' my phone, askin' for favors and shit
Texting me 'bout how we don't chill no more and shit
Give me direction, ya know
Saying, "Don't forget what you came from"
And "Make sure you fuck with me when you back in town" and shit
"Oh you never got time for me no more, you different now" and shit
Man, I'm just tryna live life
