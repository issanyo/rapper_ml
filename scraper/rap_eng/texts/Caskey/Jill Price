We have no idea how much of ourselves is created
Embedded in our memories
To shape ourselves
Like, I still feel bad about stuff I did 30 years ago
But we all do like we can all remember like one or two things and--
It's not one or two things, it's everything
And i really like
Live it and feel it..

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Yo this rap money ain't as quick as I supposed
And I'm indulged in this life I chose
Posing kinds and spending all your time inside a studio
When I'm making a killing with this script
Turning your crib into a dealership then build the shit
You got to feel this shit
If you ever had some problems on the street
I ain't grow up poor so my homies run a badge at me
Then my father died, 16, I'm the man of the house
Pullin' them cameras out, looking up at God like hear me out
But he ain't comin' anytime soon
Drowning in a pool of my surroundings, doomed, lighters on the spoons
We still up at none, suicidal convoys of a drug dealer, skip the sex
Mix and matching roaches then I flip the match, don't skip this track
My nerves bad pain pills I done served that worst track
Had me on a map, yeah but before that ain't nobody bought the tape
I used to hate seeing Wayne get all that shine until he signed me, that's my fate
Yo the universe had become a full circle
In high school I got my own robbed for guns sake
Where my homies drew the blueprints of the house
Leave my momma one day, I guess my karma lookin' out
It's with Vinnie again, my only friend when I was younger
All that ridicule we got in middle school just made my hunger stronger
To demolish all these lies I hear lately
So even when I'm gone just know you're here with me

[Hook:Caskey]
I swear I won't forget that
Floating in smoke clouds
Bitch I'm on the rise in my hometown
From my past, it ain't far away
To all the folk who hold me down
I swear I won't forget that
I remember that like Jill Price
We done did some wrong just to get right
Just to get right, call it Jill Price
Now I swear I won't forget that

[Verse 2: Pablo Escabear]
Staying at my momma, fuzzy island
Just another bastard, the streets were my father
Hard headed and stubborn, hate to take orders
Fucked by scholarships, flushed down the toilet
Hurt me to my heart so I'm still holding grudges
Party after party had me face to face with judges
Circles had me trapping out the fountain in my budget
Nigga caught me slippin' so he shot me in my stomach
Crazy part about it was that nigga was my homie
I took him on his first lick, gave him his first bricks
Showedme that don't mean shit that's why I don't trust shit
Issues in my past got my name on the death list
Stick with a full clip!, blunt full of loud shit!
Sexy little red bitch, riding in my new whip
Pocket full of money but I still ain't shit
Cause being broke and on my dick is something that I'll never forget

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jelly Roll]
Smoking on this lean and G helps to give me energy
Helps me in this industry of finna-be's and pretend-to-be's
Where everybody say they love you, but really try to fuck you
This music game ain't nothing, it's just a hustle
Until the fans come and they demand the album
But 'fore rap we sold crack out of abandoned houses
What you know about? Mama crying saying you should slow it down
But everybody broke and you the only one to hold it down
Blowing loud, remember the nights that I was whippin' away
My brother gone he sent to prison for life
If you still live in the light I pray your gettin' it right
I'm having big dreams, picket fence, kids and a wife
But until it's that time I'm on this grind and I'm a bit high
Forgive me this time but if you wasn't with me when I couldn't get by
Don't come around now that we hot as bitch fried

[Hook]

Nearly, we forget all the bad things
Or a lot of them or they're dulled
Dulled, the emotions are dulled
But, with Jill, she's right there..
