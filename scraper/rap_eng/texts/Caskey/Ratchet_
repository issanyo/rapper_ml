[Hook: Caskey]
All my partners ratchet, all my bitches ratchet
Always got the ratchet, ride 'round with the ratchet
Inside of the bank, all I do is break the plastic
Inside of the trap, all I do is break the plastic
All my partners ratchet, all my bitches ratchet
Ride 'round with the ratchet, always got the ratchet
Inside of the bank, all I do is stretch, elastic
Inside of the trap, all I do is break the plastic

[Verse 1: Caskey]
I'm high and I'm cutting the seal, the life I'm living surreal
I'm riding around with the steel, I'm tryna reach me me a mill
