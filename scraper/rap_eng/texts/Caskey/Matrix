[Intro]
Just jumped out the matrix
Yeah, ok, ok, I'm getting back to the basics
Ok, all you bitches is basic
I swear I just jumped out the matrix

[Verse 1]
Ok, I just jumped out the matrix, had to go and get it, shit
Heard you bitching 'bout your life and I guess you ain't finished yet
But it's also up for change, I don't know how you finna let
Anything stop you from getting money, you don't get it yet
You wanna change? Well then fuck it, dog, you gotta make a move
It ain't always gon' be perfect, I swear life ain't auto tune
Gotta get up off your ass and out the house before it's noon
Look at me, I ain't finished college, dude, what I did instead
I'm hanging out the window, smoking gas with the stick
Back at 17, I realized couldn't nobody tell me shit
Gotta do your own dirt to get the Rollie on your wrist
Be the master of your own craft, you could be the shit

[Chorus]
Ok, I just jumped out the matrix
Yeah, a lot of you bitches is basic
I swear I'm not letting no more time being wasted
Ok, ok, I just jumped out the matrix

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm jumping out the matrix, seeing numbers always
You gon' take someone advice or you gon' learn the hard way
When you tap into the system, see this shit from far away
I just popped some acid, hit a bitch in broad day, yea, yea, ho
Just jumped out the matrix, shorty
I swear my life is too important, yeah
I swear my life is too important, yeah
I swear these bitches try to bore me, yeah
I pull up sipping out a 40, yeah
I pull up knocking on your shorty, yeah
She said the liquor make her horny, yeah
I made that money off of tourin', yeah

[Chorus]
Just jumped out the matrix
Yeah, a lot of you bitches is basic
I swear I'm not letting no more time being wasted
Ok, ok, I just jumped out the matrix, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
I'm hanging out the window, smoking gas with the stick
Realized at 23 that couldn't nobody tell me shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Ok, I just jumped out the matrix, I ain't finna fake shit
Fuck you hoes, put you on the bang out just to skate list
Now I'm back, me and Roswell inside the spaceships
1947, came back, heard the statements
Chopping through the city like I'm not the type for patience
Never worry, even though it's probably not the safest
Ya'll look like the type of people, talking, making statements
I just smelled a bag of gas 'cause that's my favorite fragrance
Yeah, I just jumped out of the matrix
Your girl ain't have the camera, told her "tape this"
I slide throughout the city with some bracelets
They look like they is worse than nothing, make this
Just jumped out the matrix
