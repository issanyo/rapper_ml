[Intro: Caskey]
Check check
'Bout to go
Rittz
Caskey

[Hook: Caskey]
Fresh from out of a zone where they don’t like to speak my name
It's like Voldemort, they all endorse the brain but they are so afraid of change
And I am the poster child for strange, shackled up with a fuck load chains
What the fuck these rappers know 'bout pain?
I done seen some thangs
I done seen some thangs
I done seen some thangs
I done seen some

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Motherfuck social structure, I'm a postal-going buzzer
I'ma go sucker punch any Usher looking motherfucker
That’s tryna confess me something, won't you bet me something?
Thinking "dog I bet we hustling harder than the hardest junction"
The two dope boys and a dope fiend rushing
What's the motto of a scratch-off ticket and a 3 buck lotto?
Nobody gon' see us wallow in the field of indo
My kinfolk swallow everything from Klonopin to Xanax bars
To Roxy 30’s
And all of these cops be dirty
So I don't trust them when they got me
I heard he was speaking on my name

[Bridge: Caskey]
Well let me tell you the truth
I ain't nothing like how no saint be, I'm just doing right by these youth
And I ain't nothing like no Jay-Z, I'm just doing right by these booths
And I ain't ever been one to pray to God, I just pray to God I let loose

[Verse 2: Caskey]
So sick of feeling disconnected
Every day I wake up pissed, feeling misdirected
You ever been lost like you didn’t know the reason you was still here?
And you getting flashbacks of the wheel chair
Sedated in the hospital, barely made it past one of life's obstacles
Put a whole lot of strain on my opticals
I need to stop, I'm in a toxic hold
And shit I'm feeling like my pops disowned me
At least that’s what it feel like when you stop by your homie crib
And you the only kid whose pops ain't there to talk baseball, fuck this man, I hate y'all
I was spending way too much time in my room with the 8 ball, bumping that 8Ball
Tryna find a way to come up, making late calls, I was just worried 'bout a dollar, fuck a state law
Wait up, my homie had a plug with the Xanax, "ohh tell me about it"
One of his stings popped 20 at a time and he panicked
"I hope he ain't tell nobody about it" and he didn’t
But something feel wrong 'bout the song when I only tell
One side of the story
My sister made a call from a rehab phone, when she asked
What I was doing
I said “chilling”, I was sipping on a 40
Selling pills out the side of my Maxima
Damn, I deserve to have my kneecaps blown
I never really seen cash though
And I resented all the times she had relapsed so I was
Out here
And my pops shot himself in the crib that I sleep in
And my momma wonder why the fuck I had to move out
And I barely come by on the weekends, I was just tryna maintain

[Bridge: Caskey]
All eyes on the truth
I ain't nothing like how no saint be, I'm just doing right by these youth
And I ain't nothing like no AZ, I'm just doing right by these booths
And I ain't ever been one to pray to God, I just pray to God I let loose
On a 16, drop this dope

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rittz]
Papa left us, Mama worked
We would steal dollar bills right up out the purse
Another child in search of some kind of structure
Fuck school, smoking weed behind the dumpster
Taking guns to school, they tried to ban on me
They thought my family problems had damaged me
Look at the mantle, we looked so happy then
We were just acting for the camera, cheese
There’s no sanity
Young teenagers growing up in the 'burbs of Atlanta
We were so pissed off, talking shit with weapons on us
Fist fights turn into an amputee
With no broken noses
Suicidal teenagers, overdoses
Hit so close to home but we ain’t even try to show we notice
Trying to act grown up, wearing shoulder holsters
Dude from out of town trying to okie doke us
You get punked at Kroger for bumping shoulders
Get punched, lose your motherfucking fronts to mollers
Wake up and notice all your drugs are stolen
While the mall's full of middle-class cunts with strollers
We was outside chilling in the parking deck
Selling coke to a dude up in the Mustang Cobra
He done did too much and had a heart attack
That ain’t my fault is it?
Maybe I lost vision in my eyeball
I'm lost, bye mom, wishing
Hoping my pop visit, but he didn’t
Now I’m getting into trouble, I’m a time bomb ticking
Homie, I’m not living but I’m breathing though
You say you disagree but to each his own
I wanna see you put my sneakers on
There ain't no privacy no more, it's like I’m talking on a speakerphone
It's like a dead body decomposed, your nose can’t ignore it
And he can’t stand, can't damn, can’t afford it
And he god damn friends ain’t there no more
But you're still gone and you don’t plan to land in orbit
Xanax and Loritabs numb the pain
This is real life, motherfuck Hunger Games
Homie I done did and seen a ton of things
This is Rittz and Caskey, Cash Money/Strange and get killed

[Caskey]
I done seen some things
I done seen some things
I done seen some things
I done seen some
