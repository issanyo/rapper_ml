[Chorus]
Chains on my neck, that's a crucifix, yeah (crucifix)
Only time I take a L, Loubou-tin, yeah (Louboutin)
Ridin' with the two percent, yeah (two percent)
I ain't got no time just to shoot the shit, yeah (ayy)

[Verse]
Uh, piece inside my lap, yeah
Everytime that I ride around, strapped, yeah
Ayy, creepy hoes like I'm Blackbear
Check the fabric on my jacket, this is cashmere
I'm, ridin' 'round the city and I'm clutchin' fo' fives
And I fuck with ten out of tens, they a dime
Shorty in the telly with me, tryna catch a vibe
I fuck her once, then I'm dippin' out in the skies
Ayy, smokin' on that big bag, yeah, I love the pies
Ayy, shorty say she love me, but I know she wanna lie
Ayy, she see that I got the bag, wanna catch a ride
Ayy, but this ain't for free, baby, this here comin' priced
Ayy, can't you see my neck got ice?
Ayy, can't you see I know the price?
Ayy, and my necklace full of ice
Ayy, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
Chains on my neck, that's a crucifix, yeah (crucifix)
Only time I take a L, Loubou-tin, yeah (Louboutin)
Ridin' with the two percent, yeah (two percent)
I ain't got no time tryna shoot the shit, yeah (catchin' plays)
Chains, that's a crucifix, yeah (catchin' plays)
Ridin' with the two percent, yeah (catchin' plays)
Got no time to shoot the shit, yeah (catchin' plays)
Only L I got is Loubou-tins, yeah (catchin' plays)
