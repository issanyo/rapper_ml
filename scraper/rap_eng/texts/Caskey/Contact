[Chorus]
Came a long way
I got big bottles I've been drinking all day
Man, we hold it by the fifth
Got the spliff and the doshier
Got a click full of soldiers and we rollin', man we trying to catch a contact
Hit up all the hoes that we can contact, let the smoke roll through your contacts
Sendin' every number when you scroll through your contacts
And let them know that me and another world done made contact
We tryin' to catch a....

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Bang diamond in the rough
Prayin' for divine intervention sometime grindin' ain't enough
Sometimes wildin' in a cut with a slut who know ya story
Only gonna put you on when you're watching episodes of Maury
Poppin' psychotropics, quite enticed to smoke it, watching these mindless roaches
Runnin' around my whole town, man I'm on that timeless potent
Watching chem-trails wondering what the fuck they entail
Wondering what the fuck I'm breathing in when I see the shit and I inhale
Intro'd into an instant classic wrapped in plastic, respawn, reaction
Man I'm like a G bong in acid, man I'm like an eon of passion
Practically my second coming but this time I'm not pressed for money
This time I ain't fuckin' with the two face, I'm two places at one time
Ragged up with these two jays of this one pine, I'm packed up, man
I'm cool chasing this one sign that said I'mma be something homie
Sometimes shit don't go your way, but it's cool learn that from the (dot 18)???
And the kingdom go astray, so go smoke some weed or something homie....

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Caskey]
I'm James Dean sippin' lean poppin' molly
Tobert is a hundred lemme go an' drive that bugatti
He said make it a thousand, shit drive like a stallion
Told him I ain't got it, blew my advance on gold medallions
And I am so astounded, if the grace done lost it I done found it grinding
And I ain't gonna be hounded they will take shots but they won't rebound it, count it, you gonna see three eyes, bigger shit than all then all the bee eyes, average those in the g eyes need to quit the pester and be quiet, man, it's cash money records ho, I don't feel the pressure ho, cause all I know is pressure and I got more grade A than professor, all you hoes make way it's a lesson for 'em, what the fuck ya want?
Just sitting there with your mean mug, while I flick the ash of my blunt, me? I'm gonna go get the cash that I want, we can go tic for tac but that won't, end in your favor this danger everybody wanna be the savoir but they don't want to be dead in a manger, when the wolves come out, when the mask comes on, and the tool come out and the fool come out, I'mma roll it in stone, and you just stoned, bitch

[Chorus]

You ain't gotta smoke
You ain't gotta drink
You ain't gotta do what I do
Just do you
Bitch
