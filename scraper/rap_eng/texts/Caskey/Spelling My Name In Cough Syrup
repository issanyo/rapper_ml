be patient with me
this time last week
i was picking debris from my teeth
with an abandoned lighthouse
accidently,
i swallowed the lantern room
and have since cast an unwanted shadow
on all the glimmering catastrophe
i tried so hard to lodge in my stomach
they have sent a search team to my birthday party
and found rotting skeletons lining the bathroom mirror
and i fear my prescriptions are down to ration amounts
there are not enough anti-depressants south of Toronto
to unwind this cavity from my chest
i have made a sink hole of my rib cage
and as her fingers line the humps in my shoulder
she risks slipping into non-existence
if her heavy hands get too comfortable
