Check out
I get the bag, then I check out, check out
Hit the mall and spend this shit and I'ma check out
Get the call, hit the mall, check out
That lil bitch over there, check out

[Verse 1]
I don't mean to cause attention when I come and say that I'm the best out
Y'all want fuck with my lil squad, I say that ain't the best route
You been dry snitching, your whole neighborhood get wet out
Class in session on you suckas, school ain't even been let out
I got that dead look in my eyes that say, "Do not play with me"
You been asking so many questions, you work for the agency
Say you got some bad lil bitches that I could come pay to see
'cept I don't go pay for pussy, nah, I make them pay for me
Get up out the suite, I got me a lil freak, she know she headstrong
These lil rappers play too much, they know they dead wrong
I'm on, so much lean that I can't get home
I might just buy me a new crib because my check long
Sipping on, something crazy
You talking all that fuck shit, terminate it
You know I'm rocking Rich Gang, I skrrt Mercedes
I'm somewhere off of Biscayne, with thirty ladies

[Hook]
Check out, check out on 'em, check out
Pull 'em out and spend this shit and I'ma check out
I've been on, Xan, I gotta check out
She gon', with them

[Verse 2]
She gon' throw that pussy at me 'cause she know I got a name and it's buzzin'
I got so much God damn jewelry, threw a chain to my cousin
Last time that I checked, I was spitting flames and you wasn't
Y'all just want the spot but you know I'm stayin', I ain't budgin'
Got no plug, and you spent all of your chips at the club
That's a dumb, watch you damn near going broke showin' love
In your city but they don't be showing out, that's no buzz
Y'all sadiddy, I'ma pour up with the clout, with the drugs
I might buy some brand new shit, shit on your whole collection
How I'm from the south side but I'm at the Westin?
How you calling any shots? You got no reception
Why I talk 'bout weed so much? 'cause that my old profession

[Hook]
I used to check out, check out
Hit the mall and throw this shit, I'm gonna check out
Fuck with my bitch then I gotta check out
Why I'm flossing? 'cause I gotta check out
Check out
