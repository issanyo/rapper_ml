[Chorus]
Slow down, MAC-10 hangin' out the window
Ain't nobody gon' run up on me, don't run up on me, it's simple
Hold up, run it, bitch, I'm high and I'm rich
That is on God, keep a strap [?]
Runnin' through the streets, all my AKs on me
Why I ain't a killer but that murder weapon on me?
Run up, try to steal some figures, he think that he Tommy
Why I got a Tommy? I'm on Xanax like a zombie

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I'm fuckin' high and I won't lie
Every time the wire hit the bank account, I give praise to the most high
The money keep callin' my phone, [?] died
I told 'em "get it" and they won't try, hit the water, let the dope dry
First grade playground dealer, I was sellin' cookies in the back
When I was 16, [?] taught me how to split a ten sack of crack
Yeah, I sold that twice, sold a pill, sold white, [?] aight?
Found a gun safe, robbed out my mama house, they don't wanna fight
I just serve an ounce, serve a seal, hit a lick, hit a lick for two piece in Nebraska
Ain't a professional trapper, you [?] call you "cracker," we got the green like the packers
I ain't squattin', movin' backwards, had to hold weight to the front
Told them boys "keep talkin'"
[?]
[?] ain't the only thing that we gon' smoke

[Chorus]
I'm runnin' through the streets, all my AKs on me
Why I ain't a killer but that murder weapon on me?
Run up, try to split some figures, he think that he [?]
Why I got a Tommy? I'm on Xanax like a zombie
Slow down, MAC-10 hangin' out the window
Ain't nobody gon' run up on me, ain't tryna be [?], it's simple
Girl, slow down, run it, bitch, I'm high and I'm [?]
That is on God, keep a strap [?]

[Verse 2]
OK, mo' money, mo' murder
Police check me, no burner
Rebel slave, Nat Turner
Big money, sack earner
How to get a pack sermon
Rats, gotta catch vermin
Motor in the car: German
Give me space like suburban
Blood on the money, need to wash it in detergent
Handicap, no permit
Evidence, we tryna burn it
Name ringin', might've heard it
Street life, I had to learn it
Destiny is predetermined
Rich, feelin' like a sherman
Run through money, it's a burden
I'm the man and I'm burnin'
Got the santan stuffed in the curtain
Take the money, call 'em, tell 'em I earned it

[Chorus]
Slow down, MAC-10 hangin' out the window
Ain't nobody gon' run up on me, don't run up on me, it's simple
Slow down, bitch, I'm high and I'm rich
That is on God, keep a strap [?]
Runnin' through the streets, all my AK on me
Why I ain't a killer? Strap make me feel like a [?]
Try to run up on me, steal some figures, think he Tommy
Why I got a Tommy? I'm on Xanax like a zombie

[Outro]

Daddy taught me, that I gotta [?]
