[Verse 1]
Yeah, I stand as evidence
That it's hard to escape the prism of my residence
Baby girl, she look heaven sent
But she a history nerd and she like presidents
It's so evident, eyes closed, forehead
Fold to the sediment, ass up
She know that I'm holding the elements, looking for cheap thrills
And she don't want any letter but the E pills
And she know I keep bills
Keep steel for haters that wanting me killed
Thrill ride, bitch, I got an ill vibe
Kill time by popping things that are pill sized
Took the cap off the bottle and made a notion
Like, "Sip this, baby girl, that's Moscato"
I've been known to go full throttle, give it gas and pull models
And you might be interested in more follows, I looked at her, she said

[Chorus]
"Maybe," you don't wanna lay back?
Hop up inside of this ride, this a Maybach
"Maybe," girl how you gon' say that?
Tryna take the front seat and lay you way back
Maybe we should hit the bar
My crib, it ain't that far
So maybe we should hit the car
Spend the night with a star, I looked at her, she said, "Maybe"

[Verse 2]
Got the body of a goddess
Intelligent girl, you must have went to college
Polishing yo' physique, I say that possibly you a freak
You smile, acting like you ain't hear me speak
Baby, know we can run it, I'm so intoxicated-ly blunted
And wanted in different states for things I did for the hunnids
But we all got a past, bitch, don't go judge me
Because I'm in notorious spots where lots of thugs be
Shit, that's my style, the G's influence
A player plenty, I get wild for cheese, tip the Henny back
California kush, got partners out West that send me that
You interested in blowing a twenty sack?
'Cause we could blow it all girl, I keep work
Like you keep jerks failing attempts to get in your skirt
I could hurt it if you let me, she said, "Cas, boy
You sexy, but you ain't about to play me, so the answer's still"

[Chorus]
"Maybe," you don't wanna lay back?
Hop up inside of this ride, this a Maybach
"Maybe," girl how you gon' say that?
Tryna take the front seat and lay you way back
Maybe we should hit the bar
My crib, it ain't that far
So maybe we should hit the car
Spend the night with a star, I looked at her

[Verse 3]
What, you think you hot shit? Come 'round the club like you was different
Lifted above these hoes, fuck that shit, bitch, I'm pimpin'
I ain't worried 'bout these bitches out here and I ain't stressin' you
Fuck all that smooth talk bullshit that's impressin' you
I'm only worried 'bout two things, undressin' you
And putting pressure on benches, I call it bench pressin' you
Blessin' you, if you don't recognize, then you out of the line
You need to get this fucking dick on yo' mind
Hoe, you a dime, but I'm a 20 sack, ask me where my 20s at
Couldn't even find 'em, I got hunnids and yo' money wack
Honey, back up out my face in this VIP section
When did this become yo' residence? It's evident it's not
I know that you hot, but you never had enough
To keep both my eyes locked, girl, there's five spots
The face, the legs, the titties, the ass, the pussy
And if those ain't lookin' good, keep pushin'

[Chorus]
And she was like, "Maybe we should hit the bar
Go back to your car if your crib ain't far
Then I'll spend the night with a star
And you could show me that yo' dick game really up to par"
She was like, "Maybe we should hit the bar
Go back to your car if your crib ain't far
Then I'll spend the night with a star
And you could show me that yo' dick game really up to par"
And I was like, "Maybe"
