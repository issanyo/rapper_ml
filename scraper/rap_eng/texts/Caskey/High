[Hook]
I be getting high sometimes, I be getting high sometimes, yeah
I be getting high sometimes, I be getting high sometimes
To escape from the lows
To escape from the lows
I be getting high sometimes, I be getting high sometimes

[Verse 1]
In my city, I'm the big bro, need no intro
Come back into my neighborhood, it's essential
Hop up out the coupe, they dap me, I got credentials
I ain't got a problem with these, I'm with my kinfolks
Slide through the city, the crime is out the window
One of my lil cousins, he finally pull the kick door
Tryna be somebody, he blind, he being sinful
I'm prayin' for him, but more important
I know how it goes when you in trouble and you love somebody
Watching how the drugs just be fucking with their body, ah
My sister used to shoot up in my momma's house
You couldn't understand what I'm talking 'bout

[Hook]
I be getting high sometimes, I be getting high sometimes, yeah
I be getting high sometimes, I be getting high sometimes
To escape from the lows, yeah
(I be getting high sometimes, I be getting high sometimes)
I be getting high to escape from the lows, sometimes
(I be getting high sometimes, I be getting high sometimes)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I am not the big bro, lil bro, play with 64
The seventh grade, I sold a pill, my big sister know
My brother Dez, he just like me, we identical
Do all for change, this shit done turned us to a criminal
My pops bought him a gun, committed suicide
I got friends and none of them is do or die
Say they riding for ya till everything isn't unified
All of the sudden, they flip the script, happen to you and I
Tryin' to be the god, they got me out here, I'm crucified
Say you got the work in your trunk, how much do you supply?
Might just pull up on ya with sticks, take all your jewels and ride
Everybody think they shit, till someone pull up
With them choppers out the window, dog, and you ain't expect it
My lil homie was found guilty, dog, and he wasn't connected
Either way he wasn't finna go nowhere unprotected
Got me smoking on the daily like that shit my profession
I'm getting high, I

[Outro]
I be getting high sometimes, I be getting high sometimes
To escape from the lows
I  be getting high sometimes to escape from the lows
My mind ain't the type of place, you wanna go
I be popping every day, don't wanna show
I cannot look me in my face, I'm 'bout to blow
I know how it goes when you in trouble and you love somebody
Watching how the drugs just be fucking up the body, ah
