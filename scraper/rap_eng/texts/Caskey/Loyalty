[Chorus]
You was always 'bout the fame
I was always 'bout the paper
Loyalty's s'posed to be forever
How you turn into a hater?
Shit been feeling kinda strange
Why you playing mind games?
I don't need nobody help
Flossing on 'em, I'm the one rock all the chains

[Verse 1]
Came through the function
Plus I just came on my girl and I'm too high to function
I'm getting high and I'm rocking the stage
But this ain't no Broadway production
This isn't what I was thinking
When they said that rap was gon' switch up your circles
I been keeping shit so fucking cool
But I could say so much that's hurtful
I been patient with the game
I lost some opportunities, so next time they callin' me
I'ma answer with the quickness
I can't have nobody stallin' me
My motivation moving mountains
I don't need to make announcements
I really started it with ounces
I count it up and then it's countless

[Bridge]
I can't explain it
Yeah, I can't explain it
I disappeared for a second
I came back and your shit was tainted
I hear the stories that they telling me
Is that the picture that you painted?
This shit is so outrageous
Your style's so outdated

[Chorus]
You was 'bout the fame
I was 'bout the paper
Loyalty's s'posed to be forever
How you turn into a hater?
Shit been feeling kinda strange
Is you playing mind games?
I don't need nobody help
Flossing on 'em, I'm the one rock all the chains

[Verse 2]
Yo, I put the stones in
Yo, I put this shit on since it was at zero
You put your nose in, yeah
You ain't no good fella, want rob my dineros
I'm at the function
I'm the who did production
Your excuses get redundant
I don't need to ask permission
I'm the who built this shit, man
I'm the one who brought the ship in
You don't even like to work around the fucking clock
But I done kept it tickin'
I can't understand your vision
Where was you? I'm on a mission
Could see the tension in your stance
Don't make me go inside your pocket
I hope you ain't think you would stop it
Failure never was an option

[Bridge]
I can't explain it
Yeah, I can't explain it
I disappeared for a second
I came back and your shit was tainted
I hear the stories that they telling me
Is that the picture that you painted?
Your style's so outdated
This shit is so outrageous

[Chorus]
You was 'bout the fame
I was 'bout the paper
Loyalty's s'posed to be forever
How you turn into a hater?
Shit been feeling kinda strange
Is you playing mind games?
I don't need nobody help
Flossing on 'em, I'm the one rock all the chains

[Verse 3]
Some shit you just can't explain
Some shit you just can't explain
You look at me, see dedication
Some shit don't need explanation
I pull up, it's gonna be separation
Don't look at me and think we have relation
You found a match and burned a bridge down
That ain't some shit that I could live 'round
You gotta get it how you live now
I'm doing donuts in the six
And you starting to think that life could be a bitch now
It's like the doors getting kicked down
I got the stick but I can't stick 'round

[Chorus]
You was 'bout the fame
I was 'bout the paper
Loyalty's s'posed to be forever
How you turn into a hater?
