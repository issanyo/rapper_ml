[Hook]
Shawty say she want a real one
Come and take a ride
Shawty got a man though
It's cool, fuck me on the side
I'ma pull up when he dip out
I'm gonna put it in your life
I'm gonna tell her to call her best friend
You know i'm gonna do it right

[Verse 1]
Your name show up to my phone, i'm never surprised
We fuck each other so good can't severe the ties
Girl your pussy like a drug and it got me stuck
Your man trying to do his best, he's just out of luck
He work at five
Five thirty, i step out the cut
Text message says, "I'm here"
Then i'm in your guts
We respect each other minds
But the way we touch, uh
God'dess turning into a slut
Out here fucking up the whole city
I grip thighs, she show titties
Brought the weed to get high and she po' Henny
I ain't only bring a rubber, i got mo' with me
We can run through 'em it ain't no biggie
I just love the way you touch me
I touch you and you man said, fuck me
Well fuck you
He get suspicious, take your phone when he heated
But all the messages been deleted
Fucking right

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Truce, your body, be the truth
Know that god is looking out for ya, i done seen the proof
Your man cooling and he downstairs
Can i fuck you on the roof?
I'm gonna play this side so well baby
Look at him like whats the use
You something like a Muse
Your body the opposite of loose
I'm banging it and then chopping up the deuce
Something about my sex drive
Pistol whip the goose
Got me stretch your legs wide, switching up the views
I am not confused
I know exactly what to do with it
Booty big and i'm cool with it
Bitch bad and she true with it
Said my feelings starting changing when you hit it

That pussy mine
You is mine, you is mine
He think that it's his
Ya but he knows that it's mine
That pussy, that pussy mine
If i said it was his, i'd be lying
That pussy mine, that pussy mine
That pussy mine, that pussy mine
