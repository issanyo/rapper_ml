[Hook: DatYunginG5]
I hang with some shooters
And no, they don't play, got choppers and rugers
Got ARs and Ks, I be on the block
I be in these streets, I ride with that Glock
That's just how it be
I hang with some shooters
And no, they don't play, got choppers and rugers
Got ARs and Ks, I be on the block
I be in these streets, I ride with that Glock
That's just how it be

[Verse 1: DatYunginG5]
I'm a shooter myself, but I hang with them hitters
I ride with my pistol concealed
My holster, my belt and my lemon squeeze Taurus
Is scraping my Louie, for real
Keep sticks in the trunk that'll make ya ass jump
'cause it's crazy down here in the ville
It's ruthless, it's savage, these streets ain't no game
You make one wrong move and get killed
Used to bring pistols to school
Grew up on porches then hopped off the stoop
Used to drive buckets, but now I'm in coupes
Keep me an iron, no giant, that's true, oh, oh
All of my shooters is all-stars
Hit ya ass straight out the ball park
They quick to come cross like a false start
Wet your ass up in the lot with your car parked, bitch

[Hook: DatYunginG5]
I hang with some shooters
And no, they don't play, got choppers and rugers
Got ARs and Ks, I be on the block
I be in these streets, I ride with that Glock
That's just how it be
I hang with some shooters
And no, they don't play, got choppers and rugers
Got ARs and Ks, I be on the block
I be in these streets, I ride with that Glock
That's just how it be

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Yeah, I be with shooters, guerillas and killers
I hop out the whip with a rocket
I got moon rock in my pocket
Make me see the future, feel like a prophet
And all that I'm seeing is profit
Haters like feds at the do'
Only thing they gon' do; knock it
Two forties on me like Jeremy Shockey
You would never take it from me, I'm cocky
My mind state like the Oninagi
So how could I fear anybody?
They tried to fuck with me, I turned to Rocky
I put your body on ice
Yeah, but we not playing hockey
Speak 'bout me and lose your life
It's like the Illuminati
'cause I hang with some shooters

[Hook: DatYunginG5]
I hang with some shooters

That's just how it be

And no, they don't play, got choppers and rugers
Got ARs and Ks, I be on the block
