[Intro]
Smoked out with my niggas, my niggas

[Chorus]
Smoked out on the bus spittin' freestyles
Pulled up in the Montreal
Just killed me a show well over three hundred
Never would i want to copy y'all
I'm in a lot and the fans expandin'
No shades and a custom Canon
And they only know a touch of Brandon
And that's how i planned it
Man that shit too hot
When the kid gon' drop
Please don't, please don't stop
Too hot when the kid gon' drop
Please don't, please don't stop
That shit too hot when the kid gon' drop
Please don't, please don't stop
Ya, Hip hop been waitin' for the come back
And you the one that got this shit locked
Straight up

[Verse]
I'm never gettin' sick of the tour life
I could use my girl on the bus though
I'm gettin' sick of these Loki ass folks
Inside the show called, "Rap"
In the street being cut throat
Blunt smoke help me analyze different
Like who the fuck am i to see the hand that i'm givin'
Is my time tookin' or is that a lie
Man is i'm trippin'
I take a fan at the show as a sign givin'
Back to the notepad
Addicted to sixteen
Man it's like a dope Add
But i been lost in the corner
Where they only wanna hear about the Louie Vuitton shoes
And the cars, and it's so sad
Well call this a shift in the paradigm
A young artist addicted to Caroline
And i ain't afraid to talk about some life shit
Like when i was at KFC and workin' on the night shift
Tryin' to make a dollar like when are things gon' change
And my home boy touch, hit, and licks
And i know that the karma weighin' on his armor
Dog but he's still gettin' rich
And i'm sittin' here broke as a joke doin' coke in the hotel
Drowin' in sorrow, drowin' in sorrow
Everything goes back in the box
And you pay twice back what'chu borrow
Straight up

[Chorus]
Smoked out on the bus spittin' freestyles
Pulled up in the Montreal
Just killed me a show well over eight hundred
Never would i want to copy y'all
I'm in a lot and the fans expandin'
No shades and a custom Canon
And they only know a touch of Brandon
And that's how i planned it
Man that shit too hot
When the kid gon' drop
Please don't, please don't stop
Too hot when the kid gon' drop
Please don't, please don't stop
That shit too hot when the kid gon' drop
Please don't, please don't stop
Word, Hip hop been waitin' for the come back you
And you the one that got this shit locked
Straight up

[Outro]
Smoked out with my niggas, my niggas
