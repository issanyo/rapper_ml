[Hook]-

Chop chop on the stove ima show you how to cook
Yea yea yea
I'ma show you how it look one
It remind me of some breaking bad
All this heisenberg money probably make em mad

Chop chop on the stove ima show you how to cook
Couple hundred grand cash
I'ma show you how it look oh
It remind me of some breaking bad
All this heisenberg money

[Verse one]-

I swear to god man
I hope they watching
This here ain't on netflix
But its the next thing poppin'
Everything a lil bit toxic
Everything a lil more submerged
In the eurge for the profit
This here non stop it
This a lesson from Walt
Haters emerging in salt
Me and jesse on a jet ski
Trying to find a bad lil broad
With the best street
Back to the lab lets see
I'm covered in medical rags
The crystal meth is in several bags
Burning these federal flags
This is forever who ask
Words backsword slow grind caz you serve backsword
Dropped off can't pack it afterwords
Who thought I'd be snapping after word
They didn't think I'd be back here after yours
Who would of thought id lose my passion
All of my sub shit crashing
All of my dolla bills on rooftops stacking
This here don't even happen
What's real before I die
I gotta make at least one mil
Right i got all this blue dream
Might pop at least one pill
Well its a big no
Everything is in biz mode
Me and mine don't even get stoned
Saving up for that big home
Man that new ride,or some bad hoes
With a cool vibe then cash out
We the dope suppliers we we don't know them lies
We just breaking bad!

It remind me of some breaking bad
All this heisenberg money probably make em mad X2

[verse two]-

I treat this here like a business woe
Can i get a witness no
Everybody knowing I could win this  slow
Ballin' shit I came a long way from gokuu drawlings
They try to swore I miss i got soo many of these things
I don't know who's calling bitch
And I got propane in the litter
Cold chain in the heater
Cocaine in my sneaker
This is an analogy
My hustle game is your alogy
My day rate is your salary
We don't coincide in reality
I got a cold heart
All I fuck with is lone sharks
You was lookin like tadpoles
We assholes you got no part in this game
You got no spark in this flame
We are so partial to lames
Tryin' to get a little taste of these traits
Tryin' to get a little taste of this fame
Shame on em but she'll bang on em
We run game on  em  scar monthly my name on em
Ball up and they pass out
We came here to cash out
We the dope suppliers we we don't know them lies
We just breaking bad!

[Outro]-
This a song about poverty
Black market underground drugs
Fuel economies obviously we ain't so concerned with yo policy
Every 16 that we drop is a robbery
