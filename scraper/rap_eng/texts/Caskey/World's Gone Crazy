[Chorus: Rambo Hustle]
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord

[Verse 1: Rambo Hustle]
I wake up, pour some Henny in my cup
Stay awake, I'm so impatient for this buck
Plus I push it for the city 'cause the station ain't the plug
Everybody lookin' at me so tough, you ain't made mistakes?
You ain't fornicate? You ain't play with fire?
You ain't got no faith? You ain't gotta pray
But we probably should, we on death row
And you ain't close to Suge, you ain't bossin' up
You ain't fit, dog, there's only so much space in every scene, dog
Where your name at?
And where you rather be? For your lady, for your baby
Or you just wanna be? Oh, what a scene
And what a time, to be alive
While others die, over racial pride
But what that really say? That we better off?
Or we better dead? Nobody innocent, no

[Chorus: Rambo Hustle]
Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Yeah, my dog ain't vote for Trump
But he got him a bag that's full of Hillary
Lookin' like the far-right wing with this artillery
The liquor 'bout to spill at the crib like a distillery
The streets cold, police got hostility
Thots been tryna build with me, ops are not killin' me, no
Death come in abundance, they not trilogies
Every time I turn on the news, the plot chillin' me
I spoke to myself and think of my loose ways
Two weeks medication, it's been two days
My partner got hooked on the roxies, he called 'em blue jays
Used to get so high he could fly without a suitcase
Bodies gettin' caught in my city, it's not a new phase
This the shit that go up on a Tuesday, no Bobby Boucher
All that water got substituted for D'ussé
"The world crazy," I said, "touché"

[Chorus: Rambo Hustle]
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord

[Collison: Donald Trump]
Get 'em outta here
Get out, get 'em outta here

[Verse 3: Rambo Hustle]
See, the crowd's goin' crazy, it's all about the ratings
We all so thirsty, but is it all worth it?
Seven years later, 'bout a thousand more verses
Hate me, I'm Hispanic and Trump said I was a rapist
Quote unquote racist, anonymous faces
Obama won, face it, I'm countin' blue faces
Water in the pot (Come on)
And them cigarettes like crack
And they'll kill you for a stack
And you can't get that dollar back, man
Streets still watchin', tomorrow ain't promised
All about timin', all about family
Every time she want me, I don't want her, the audacity
And pops said that I'm crazy 'cause I'm rappin' like "who signin' me"
Watered-down, Dasani how this music now be soundin'
Think it's crazy that they let y'all slide
USA! USA!

[Chorus: Rambo Hustle]
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy, Lord, Lord, Lord
I swear the world's gone crazy
