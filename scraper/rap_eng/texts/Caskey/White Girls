[Hook]
She like popping off Percocets, dog
And she all inside the club
She got that white girl problem
And she love it though, it make her feel loved
She in the new spot
Every other day of the week, she on drugs
She got that white girl problem
And she love it though, it make her feel loved

[Verse 1]
She just dropped some molly in a double dirty Sprite
I looked at her, what the fuck?
I been riding 'round town with the heater
I don't know who to trust
Say she smoke like she Bob Marley cousin
I just took a puff
Don't know who this girl think she is
But she know her way around this stuff
She don't like when she go without it
I can see, man, this girl is so about it
Ah wee, our mind is so overclouded
Floor seats, at the show we're throwing dollars
No sleep, baby, you was cool without it
Tell me how we s'posed to love you when you don't allow it?
Yeah, when you don't allow it
Yeah, 'cause you always on the drugs

[Verse 2]
Whoa, blow
She from the south but she love the snow
Whoa, blow
She a white girl playing with her nose
She got that white girl problem and she love it though
She all inside the club
I'm tryna get through to her
But it ain't working out so much
Hello, are you there behind them glazed eyes?
I can feel it in your touch
I got Percocets all inside my pocket, dog
Who can you trust?
Who do you trust?
Who is you calling up when you on a crush?
Who do you feel? How is it real?
Are you losing, baby, that control of the wheel?
It's so hard for me, you was a part of me
Used to call me on my cell phone, now you're hard to reach
Your love is like a tattoo, baby, you're scarrin' me
Used to have my cup running over, you're starvin' me
That shit is hard for me, you went so far for me
Can we cut the bullshit? Baby, jump in the car with me
Take all these bars with me, shoot to the stars with me
Go back to the place you know that you had the heart for me
You always on drugs
