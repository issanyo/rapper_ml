[Intro]
I'm in the town for one night
And I need to slow down, yeah

[Chorus]
Slow down, rap on the field, trap with the fo' pounds
Feelin' like the end is near, we gettin' close now
Look me inside of my eyes, it's like a ghost town
All my dogs lookin' at me, you need to slow down
Slow down, trap out the field, trap with the fo' pounds
Feelin' like the end is near, we gettin' close now
Look me inside of my eyes, it's like a ghost town
You need to slow down, you need to slow down

[Verse 1]
I'm in the field
I'm blowin' smoke for real
I'm in a place where there's no love
Tryna find what is real
I'm makin' sales
Tryna stay above water, but they clockin' the seal
They tried to drown me
Left me out for damned, but I'm up and it's still
"Oh shit, he here"
They lookin' at me like it's somethin' surreal
Them odds stacked against me
I kept it busy, I'm chasin' the mill and they still tryna deal
I came from nothin' to somethin'
My pops wasn't even there
Somehow I made my own money
And y'all busy tryna politic, I'm tryna speed up
In the city, I'm geeked up
I ain't slept in like four days
My brain cells kinda beat up
My eyes look like a ghost town
And I did it in my own time
And all my people tellin' me that, "Boy, you need to..."

[Chorus]
Slow down, trap out the field, trap with the fo' pounds
Feelin' like the end is near, we gettin' close now
Look me inside of my eyes, it's like a ghost town
All my partners lookin' at me, yeah
You need to slow down trap out the field, trap with the fo' pounds
Look me inside of my eyes, it's like a ghost town
Feelin' like the end is near, we gettin' close now
You need to slow down, you need to slow down
Slow down

[Verse 2]
Runnin' in the fast lane second that the pack came
Married to the money, last name
We don't ever change, but we stack change
Dark nights in the bat cave
Ain't no point in frontin', tryna act brave
Blood stains on the black suede
You ain't got the answers, why you ask, Sway?
Feelin' like Ye, bitches in my way
Money comin' in, it's a business day
Why you frontin' on me, tryna imitate?
Life gave me problems, I made lemonade, yeah
It's somethin' like Em and Jay
Man, I feel like a renegade
My life purpose was to innovate
Started out with scrapin' crumbs on the dinner plate
Yeah, tryna speed up
I'm workin' overtime, one day I'ma have my feet up
I'm poppin' too many things, got my heart tryna keep up
Momma sayin' that, "You beat up and boy, you need to..."

[Chorus]
Slow down, trap out the field, trap with the fo' pounds
Feelin' like the end is near, we gettin' close now
Look me inside of my eyes, it's like a ghost town
All my partners lookin' at me, you need to slow
You need to slow down trap out the field, trap with the fo' pounds
Look me inside of my eyes, it's like a ghost town
Feelin' like the end is near, we gettin' close now
You need to slow down, you need to slow down
Slow down

[Verse 3]
I never slow down
Even if shit ain't the same and it ain't like my old sound
Hold me down, overpowered, overpriced
Take a chance, roll the dice
Hold your own, hold the stance, hold the mic
Follow your own advice, get to know your vice
So many people is hangin' on me
Need my shoulders iced
Fuck is a poltergeist?
You don't get a moment twice
Devil on me, he cold as ice
Head white as a bowl of rice
Move that shit on my sober nights
Reminisce on my older plights
Nowadays, it's a boulder heist
Money stack up to shoulder height
Y'all busy tryna politic, I'm tryna speed up
In the city, I'm geeked up
I'm in the kitchen for three days
I'm tryna turn the heat up
I just re'd-up, yeah
Fuck the alphabet, I'm G'd up, yeah
Momma say, "You beat up," yeah
Girl, you need to...

[Chorus]
Slow down, trap out the field, trap with the fo' pounds
Feelin' like the end is near, we gettin' close now
Look me inside of my eyes, it's like a ghost town
You need to slow down, you need to slow
Need to slow down, trap out the field, trap with the fo' pounds
Feelin' like the end is near, we gettin' close now
Look me inside of my eyes, it's like a ghost town
You need to slow down, you need to slow down
Slow down
