[Intro]
It's the motherfucking Black Sheep, boy

[Chorus]
Pop a Xan with a killer and lose your inhibitions
Police follow us, the only thing they got, suspicions
I spend the check and get the check, you with that penny pinchin'
I got way too much henny in my system
So I talk that shit and walk that shit like whoa
I talk that shit and walk that shit like whoa
I talk that shit and walk that shit like whoa
Gettin' money over here, you way too slow

[Verse 1]
You should do yourself like Lambo do's, hatin' on me, kill yourself
I done seen so many people change on me, I'm still myself
In the [?] valley, smokin' Cali, feel like I'm with Snoop
In the fo' do' Sally, left the rally, we shoot out the roof
Shit, I pimp with pencil, big potential, we got all the juice
Y'all just sentimental, really gentle, let the choppers loose
Got the bill like Cosby, I go kamikaze, I got roots
Y'all go up the bad, I turn to Ozzy, we gon' call a truce
We give all our praise to the most high, blessed to be alive, homie, most die
In a moshpit, let the bulls fly, you a square, probably rock a bowtie
Man, I won't lie, never see the fruits of your labor if you don't try
My mindstate is like a goldmine, need another ounce 'cause I sold mine

[Chorus]
Pop a Xan with a killer and lose your inhibitions
Police watchin' us, the only thing they got, suspicions
I spend the check and get the check, you with that penny pinchin'
I got way too much henny in my system
So I talk that shit and walk that shit like whoa
I talk that shit and walk that shit like whoa
I talk that shit and walk that shit like whoa
Our money fast and yo' shit way too slow, ayy

[Verse 2]
Y'all just on that fake ass Actavis, that's some Xaned out Robitussin
Pringles, boy, I stack the chips, G'd out like my older cousin
Lowkey when I ride the whip, y'all so loud, the police know
Started beef with me at three, we pulled up at his crib at fo'
At the stove, [?] them swishers, need those just to roll
Find a needle in a haystack, playback on yo' shit, reload
Way back when I was a child, we used to eat that chicken cold
Now they heat that chicken right up on the stove, check the quote
I call my bitch "my bitch," my hoe "my hoe," just got a onion sold
Fourteen karats on my pinky ring, this not my conscious flow
Confidence enclosed, bitch, we not the [?], I got constant flows
Competition run up on me, turn to optimals
[?] get smoke, I'm the mafuckin' GOAT, you love when you drop the soap
Smokin' on that gas but it's not the coke, got the snow in an envelope
I get people all kinda hoes, yeah, you don't even kinda know
You need a purpose and I got a [?] my worldview is like kaleidoscope

[Chorus]
Pop a Xan with a killer and lose your inhibitions
Police follow us, the only thing they got, suspicions
I get the check and spend the check, you with that penny pinchin'
I got way too much henny on my system
So I talk that shit and walk that shit like whoa
I talk that shit and walk that shit like whoa
I talk that shit and walk that shit like whoa
Yo' shit way too slow
