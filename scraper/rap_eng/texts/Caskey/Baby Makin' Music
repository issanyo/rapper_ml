[Verse 1: Caskey]
Baby, I could be your smooth criminal, you been struck
Both eyes saying we should fuck, so subliminal
I guess I'm tryin' to get physical
Must've missed something 'bout the visual of rapture back
You could catch me with a stack, matter fact
Making thunder clouds over your lap
Tell me what's the combination to get opening that
Second that I get inside, have you soaking in sweat
I mean it's time to get cooled down, 'cause my song making moves now
Calculated steps and checks, got a smooth sound
I wonder if she got a cool style
Insinuation from her body hit the mood now
Break from the huddle, space shuttle flight, duffle bag, money in sight
Got a body that could muzzle my bite
I make it bark for a couple of nights, get dark with the lights
Then see if you got the heart to ignite, it gets hot

[Pre-Hook]
But it don't stop
Shorty wants [?] hands on you
But it don't stop
There really ain't no telling just what I might do
But it don't stop
Just to get you in the mood
Told you, I want you
And I want you to want me, too

[Hook]
Let me see you bumping, grinding to this baby makin' music
Dancing, sliding down the poll to baby makin' music
Backseat of your car, suggest you go 'head and do it
To this baby makin' music, baby makin' music

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Yeah, I wade back 'til the moment is right
Exchange looks like currency for change while you sip drank, potion is light
What is that you like, coconut Sprite?
Got you open like it's opening night
Shorty, you's on fire, I'm smoking tonight, I'm just sayin'
Don't ask who's stroking it right, 'cause I ain't playin'
Been known to make motion for nights, at the [?] you're like
"Tell my manager, I'm gonna need some more for the night"
We in the right time and place
Mindstate could only get better, she got a fine taste
Working like we going back to my place
Introduce you to the keys to my ride, and let me vibrate
The game we living in is high stakes
So I'm all in, got the body of a queen, but she a high ace
I give a fuck about your mindspace
I'm just tryna link via real talk, tell me if you wanna get hot

[Pre-Hook]
But it don't stop
Shorty wants [?] hands on you
But it don't stop
There really ain't no telling just what I might do
But it don't stop
Just to get you in the mood
Told you, I want you
And I want you to want me, too

[Hook]
Let me see you bumping, grinding to this baby makin' music
Dancing, sliding down the poll to baby makin' music
Backseat of your car, suggest you go 'head and do it
To this baby makin' music, baby makin' music

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Now tell me what the definition of a freak is, won't you keep this
The hips ain't lied to me yet, got me speechless
I wonder if my hands know about her weakness
Just a night at home, but we sleepless
Shorty doing something, must be mind control, telekinesis
My body doing everything she want to
It's been said I want it all, but I want you
And I want you to want me, too
But I want you

[Hook]
Let me see you bumping, grinding to this baby makin' music
Dancing, sliding down the poll to baby makin' music
Backseat of your car, suggest you go 'head and do it
To this baby makin' music, baby makin' music
Let me see you bumping, grinding to this baby makin' music
Dancing, sliding down the poll to baby makin' music
Backseat of your car, suggest you go 'head and do it
To this baby makin' music, baby makin' music

[Outro: Caskey]
Yeah
Did I mention that it don't stop? Huh?
Did I mention that it don't stop? Huh?
Did I mention that it don't stop? Yeah, yeah, huh?
Did I mention that it don't stop? Bitch
