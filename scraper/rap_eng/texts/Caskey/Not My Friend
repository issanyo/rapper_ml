[Intro]
Too much sauce
It's the same shit

[Verse 1]
Every time, every time they hate on me, gon' drop again
You is just a take, you not my friend
We just getting started, this not the end
Yeah, some relationships was not to mend
Yeah, jump on a yacht and getting drunk
Ya'll little ship is getting sunk
How is you popping that? I'm tryin' to bump
Yeah, fishscale on that ship, just took a little acid, tryna trip
I fuck a bad bitch then dip
The self worth ain't in the whip
But this shit there quite crisp
Switch ya angle, every song a hit single (Damn)
Pussy tasting like a mango
Me and rubber bands getting entangled
Bugatti, bloody angel, I got the ticket, Fandango
You're hating on me, man, that's shameful
You know I'm glowing like my chain though

[Hook]
Swish, game on flex, drop, my damn
You an undercover, hater, you not my friend
Not my friend, not my friend, bitch, you not my friend
Only person I'ma talk to, name is Benjamin

[Verse 2]
Dabbin' on em face first like I threw up inside the toilet
Bitch, I'm winnin' in the end, I don't mean to spoil it
I'm feeling joyous
You was obnoxious and came in here boisterous
Now this shit pointless
I'm scoring up the points, I'm getting anointed
I'll touch the ceilin'
Seen your movement, I don't know what's so appealin'
Fuck it, play the villain
I can't act like I'm a regular civilian
Bitch, I'm worth a million
Might gon' hate but you gotta respect the work ethic
In the studio all night long
Tryna add another little stone to my necklace

[Hook]
Might have to come flex again
You an undercover, hater, you is not my friend
Not my friend, not my friend, bitch, you not my friend
Only person I'ma talk to, name is Benjamin
