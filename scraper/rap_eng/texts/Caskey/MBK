[Chorus: Doobie]
Right now I'm talkin' money, that shit that get the bitches
Hylyte keep that pole, and I promise he ain't fishin'
On my mama, that's my brother, and you can't tell us different
My mama his mom too, and that blood don't make no difference

[Verse 1: Doobie]
I think I need a new safe 'cause the money overflowin'
Is it rainin' or it's snowin'? I don't know, I just throw it
Threw some water on her neck 'cause her throat just like the ocean
And my partner got her next, we ain't cuffin', we just throwin' 'em
Ayy, when I'm out in Philly, I'm with Dub P, foe and them
How many bitches did I fuck this week? Fo' of them
Broski got that forty, I ain't talkin' 'bout no Olde E
Shorty sucked my dick and now she felt like she had no teeth
Big dope, on me, all day, all week
Fuckin' these hoes, when I'm done, don't call me
Called my main bitch, hit the mall and it's on me
When I hit the crib, I'ma dive in it, ball deep

[Chorus: Doobie]
I'm talkin' money, that shit that get the bitches
Hylyte keep that pole, and I promise he ain't fishin'
On my mama, that's my brother, and you can't tell us different
My mama his mom, and that blood don't make no difference

[Verse 2: Hylyte]
Takin' trips with yo' bitch off that coke and that loosie
Say she don't do drugs and you believed her like a goofy
Had her off that henny and she fucked me like she knew me
Said her brain was crazy and I told that bitch to school me
Call up lil Doobie, said he on his way now
All these bustdowns got me feelin' like the Greyhound
You ain't put me up on game, I get paid to play now
When I see that bitch, I always hit her with that "hey now"
Girlfriend's on my dick, I told her pray it 'til she prayed out
Put it in her mouth, bitch, what you got to say now?
All these hoes the same, I'ma play 'em 'til they fade out
She got that backend, I'm just waitin' on my payout
You ain't gettin' money

[Chorus: Doobie]
Money, that shit that get the bitches
Hylyte keep that pole, and I promise he ain't fishin'
On my mama, that's my brother, and you can't tell us different
My mama his mom, and that blood don't make no difference

[Verse 3: Krash Minati]
I only fuck with us, that's why I don't never come around
I've been runnin' since lil Doobie was underground
I don't trust shit, nigga, miss me with that run-around
I've been money hungry since a nigga was a hunnid pounds
A hunnid miles and runnin', I ain't sweatin', shit, I run it now
I need it more than ever, I've been better, all my brothers smilin'
If Ms. Teresa call me, I'ma answer, I'm her other child
Money talk to me, I don't click over 'less my mother dialin'

[Verse 4: Caskey]
I don't click over 'cause I'm busy on a stain, bitch
Ain't talkin' money, we must speak a different language
Go boys, get up in my space and I get anxious
My house I painted, my inside well acquainted, I'm tainted
White bitches with me with her, but it's not a banquet
Franklin my BF and my BM candy painted
Perfect aimin' and not complainin'
Play with me, they find you, couldn't find out what yo' name is
I'm doin' wheelies on a Harley
They might not know me, but they ain't gon' disregard me
I got some bitches and some molly, it's a party
And I run 'round with a army

[Chorus: Doobie]
Right now I'm talkin' money, that shit that get the bitches
Hylyte keep that pole, and I promise he ain't fishin'
On my mama, that's my brother, and you can't tell us different
My mama his mom, and that blood don't make no difference
