[Hook: The Kid Big Ty]
We work hard like every day, it ain't much to say
We 'bout our business, but we ain't got time to play, nah
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Okay, boy, we got what you want, we grinding, fuck is you on?
Why are your dreams pending? Better chase 'em why the prolong?
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 1: The Kid Big Ty]
Yeah, boy, we grinding, it ain't much to say, so move on
Make you haul ass like them trucks, move on
Y'all was cutting up, we had to cut you like some coupons
Boy, y'all lil boys funny, funny like Lil Duval
Now who are all up in yo' head like a [?]
The answer; BBT, we gave yo' brain blast like nuetron
Lot of fools dream, but drag on action, that's RuPaul
BBT, we muscled up the strength, grey poupon, hm
June III on the track [?]
Boy, this beat too fire, had to give you recognition
Heard them boys tryna rap, failed, ain't no passin'
Put my heart up on these tracks, know you hear the passion
Records Out Da Kitchen who we reppin', ain't no guessin'
If you second guessin' that, pimpin', you could get to steppin'
Yeah, we grinding, yeah, we working, ain't no stressin'
Shooting out these tracks, we some lyric Smith & Wessons
Nah, who working harder in the city?
A lot of fools rapping, but they ain't messing with B...
BT, feel me? They ain't messing with we
You in your feelings 'bout it, well then tell them boys come see me

[Hook: The Kid Big Ty]
We work hard like every day, it ain't much to say

Okay, boy, we got what you want, we grinding, fuck is you on?
Why are your dreams pending? Better chase 'em why the prolong?
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 2: Big Boom]
I'm ducked off like a yeti
My flow is so real, like real niggas acting petty
I ain't fucked your girl, but I settled for that heady
I'm tryna stack my cheese and I ain't talking 'bout the fetti
Be working, we working, we grinding, that's most def'
Y'all slacking, getting held back, straight F's
This beat knocking so hard, I'm going straight deaf
Flow so prometh, allergic to your whole set
Ready, set, go, bitch, I'm about to take off
And if you got a problem, bitch nigga, we can face off
Fucking with me wrong, BBT can knock your face off
The hoes screaming, "Hey y'all!" Them hoes better lay off
'cause I ain't with that bullshit, man, I thought you knew this
Keep your eyes on me like I'm standing in the pulpit
Boy, I got a full clip of lyrics, fuck the bullets
Really man, you should quit, your aim is very foolish
Three under our belt, man, we did it by ourself
Fuck you, we don't need your help, bruh, I deal shit, be kept
Got that Aaron Rodgers flow, I'm just putting on my belt
Bitch, I first degree murdered this beat, call for help, nigga

[Hook: The Kid Big Ty]
We work hard like every day, it ain't much to say
We 'bout our business, but we ain't got time to play, nah
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Okay, boy, we got what you want, we grinding, fuck is you on?
Why are your dreams pending? Better chase 'em why the prolong?
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 3: Caskey]
I swear, ever since a child, there was something 'bout my passion
I was always, always working, I was hardly here, relaxin'
I am hardly here for practice, every day my second comin'
Every day, my momma worked, every day, she pressed for money
I ain't got no time to coordinate with these lesser dummies
I just take 'em all to school, then get that professor money
Then get that oppressor money, they think that I'm middle aged
With some slaves, the way that I'm always getting paid
But I been gripping J's
Plotting double overtimes, barely getting laid
Still get appraised, probably finna get a raise
Probably finna rage on your woman, bring her center stage
You just throw change on a woman
Me? I'm an asshole, I'm the type to go change on a woman
I be working so hard, boy, shame on a woman
Who think I'm just getting fame for some praise from a woman
Fuck I look like? A hot commodity?
I just turned every instrumental to a robbery
And I'ma need your change and your chain and your honesty
Name another rapper who is hot as me

[Hook: Caskey]
I swear, I just work hard like every day, ain't much to say
And I'm 'bout my business, I ain't got no time to play
I just, work, work, work, work
Work, work, bitch, woo
