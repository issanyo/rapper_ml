[Chorus: ClicKlak]
The bitch, yeah, she hot as wasabi
She think I'm the life of the party
That bitch, she hot as wasabi
I fold her up like origami
That bitch, she hot as wasabi
She think I'm the life of the party
That bitch, she hot as wasabi
I fold her up like origami

[Verse 1: ClicKlak]
Yeah, yeah, Jackie Chan and I'm kickin' game
Jackie Chan, watch me kick my game
Jackie Chan, watch me kick my game
Jackie Chan, watch me kick my game
Jackie Chan, watch me kick my game
Jackie Chan, watch me kick my game
Jackie Chan, watch me kick my game
Jackie Chan, watch me kick my game
Bruce Lee, watch me kick my game
Swagger [?] for a fuckin' chain
I got bitches and they give me brain
But her intellect will never change
I told that bitch she could get a ticket
If she 'bout it then I might just lick it
No, no, no, I won't just lick it
Pimpin' never, ever lickin' pussy
All I ever did was dick her down
Couldn't wait 'til she came to town
She gon' understand I always clown
Jokin', jokin', but I get around
I got bitches and they like to do it
I got bitches and they like to do it
Call her [?] they like to do it
I sell bitches and I like to move it

[Bridge: ClicKlak]
Fresh fruit at the Ritz Carlton
(Grapes, melons)
Who is you? I beg your pardon
(Pimp)
It's Pimpin', Pimpin' pimpin' women
(Women, women, women, women)
Them other fuck niggas, they be simpin'
(Hey!)

[Chorus: ClicKlak]
The bitch, yeah, she hot as wasabi
She think I'm the life of the party
That bitch, she hot as wasabi
I fold her up like origami
That bitch, she hot as wasabi
She think I'm the life of the party
That bitch, she hot as wasabi
I fold her up like origami

[Verse 2: Tyla Yaweh & Caskey]
What to do today?
Gotta jugg in every way, yeah
What to do today?
Gotta serve all this yay, yeah
What to do today?
I gotta break the fuckin' pot
Skrt off in the Range
I got juggies at my spot
I got juggs all at my spot
I got two bitches up on my phone, still bitchin'
Just fucked 'em last week, went missin'
Oh yeah, I'm so indifferent
Guap, I've been gettin' to the knots
I've been gettin' to the check
Don't even call my phone if it ain't 'bout sex
Just bought a new rolex
I said please don't call my phone, I'm headed to the guap
You better get the check up
Niggas better catch up
These bitches actin' extra
Aye, please don't call my bitch's phone
She busy suckin' dick inside a foreign body
Pussy lookin' like a lotus flower
I fold her legs into some origami, aw yeah
Oh my God
