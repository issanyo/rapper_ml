[Chorus]
Please don't let me go, oh
Please don't let me go, yeah, oh
Please don't let me go (go, go) whoa
Please don't let me go (go) yeah (go) yeah (go, go, go)
Please don't let me go

[Verse]
Close to the edge, bad bitch in my bed
Smoke one to the head, please don't let me go (go, go)
Shorty, let me go (go, go, go)
Please don't let me go (oh)
Know that sometimes I get faded and I'm tryna go (go, glow)
I'm on half a pill and only you made me feel al-right (ay, ay)
All these girls in LA always askin' me for snow, white (snow, snow)
Why the fuck we leave each other? That shit I'll never know why
Push me to the edge, bad bitch in my bed
Make me think of you, what's up with my head?
I smoke one to the head, think back 'bout what you said
It only made me stronger, had to go and get this bread
Can't get rich without ya ('out ya)
Can't get rich without ya ('out ya)
I've been smokin' so much 'cause I only think about ya ('bout ya)
So please don't let me go, oh

[Chorus]
Please don't let me go, yeah, oh
Please don't let me go, bad bitch
