[Pre-Hook: Nine Callisto]
I don't fuck with these haters, no, I don't and never will
I been tryna hustle hard and get it back, I keep it real
I got stress up on my mind, I sag my pants and pop a pill
It's 'bout time you paid attention, every track I make, I kill

[Hook: Nine Callisto]
Y'all haters so salty, boy, you looking salty
Y'all haters so salty, boy, you looking salty
Studying my Twitter, man, y'all hoes so hungry
I'm gon' hustle hard daily, y'all boys hustle monthly

[Verse 1: Nine Callisto]
You so salty, little boy, you whining like a little bitch
You be tryna act so gangster, but you ain't talking stick
Heard yo' homie just got bodied, that's what happens when you talkin'
All that salt be on yo' body, I suggest a rinse and faucet
Run up on me, get murked, everyday put in work
I'm ahead of the curve, I keep spitting bars like I'm Durk (Okay)
Stupid hoes better shut up, you fucked three guys in a dump truck
Mask on me like Meta Knight, might rob a hoe, I'm on a come up
Black whip like Darth Vader, Cash Money, so major
Shout out to KPE, we be hotter than the damn equator
I've been paid, I've been played, I've been copied
But I've never felt so God damn cocky

[Verse 2: Gwalla]
Know why you hating, 'cause we on toe
I know why you hating, 'cause we on toe
Getting this money and we want mo'
I'm getting this money and we want mo'
Hopping out foreigns with 'cide on the do's
Hopping out foreigns with su-way do's
And you still pushing in that RAV4
And you still pushing in the beat up RAV4
Got no shame
Pockets low, only one to blame
But you hating like you getting paid
Save your two cents, you could keep the change
(Save your two cents, you could keep the change)
I don't pay 'tention to any hater
I do like Kinko's and get the paper
Stack it up tall like a skyscraper
Hot like pepper, you a saltshaker
Now I got bitches that come in flavor
Different colors like a Now & Later
We going up like a elevator
I'ma kill the pussy like a terminator
She start to bugging, I'm exterminator
Kick her out, there go your Uber, shorty
All of these spices, you choose to be salty
I fucked your friend and left you stuck at the party

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Okay, I don't even know who they is, how they salty
I put Xan all in my coffee, they don't know how much this cost me
I just hit that pussy all on top the couch and hit the PJ
They won't roll with me, I touch down in the city, make it D-Day
Slick with the dick
Playing basketball the only time you seen a brick
Hey, shorty asking if I'm back on the lean
This my business what I sip
I'm making phone calls on the private jet
You mad 'cause you ain't out of debt
They calling, asking where the sour at
Yo, sorry, we only got powder packs
Damn, I just put some in my lean, where's the Xanax?
Y'all so fucking salty, I can't stand it
Once you get the dough, it all expand
That's a snake, it's not your fam
Ain't gon' show up at yo' show so they could hate on Instagram
Fucking salty
