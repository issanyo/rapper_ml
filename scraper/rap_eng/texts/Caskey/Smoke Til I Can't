[Intro]
We gon' fuck around and get Wiz Khalifa on this bitch
Probably the only one that could keep up

[Chorus]
I smoke 'til I can't, I'm covered in dank
I just left out of California, came to fuck up the bank
And I got the jewelry on me and it's wet like the paint
And I ain't claim to be a saint, I think I'm everything they ain't
I smoke 'til I can't, whoa, I smoke 'til I can't
Yeah, I smoke 'til I can't
I got the jewelry on me and it's drippin' in dank
And I just pulled up to the bank, and I ain't claim to be a saint

[Verse 1]
I smoke 'til I can't, yeah, in the kitchen and it's Taysty
She put so many drugs in the blunt that I nickname her Lacy
And I ain't out chasin' a high, man, a high finna chase me
I'm blowin' kush like the AC, move too many, man, the plug gotta pace me
Don't play with my paper, I'm only gon' shop if it's full
You a bitch and you don't even do all the shit that you want, hey
I get that bread by the loaf, said I'ma hit up the coast, left and came back in a ghost
You can't decide if you love her or not, never had that type debate with the knots
I got that Glock on my waist while I'm smokin', I ain't finna box
Yeah, and I got a car full of bops, and I'm ridin' on the opps
And I'm, and I'ma work my lil wrist, give 'em somethin' to watch
Yeah, and I can't fuck with you if you would fuck with the cops

[Chorus]
I smoke 'til I can't, I'm covered in dank
I just left out of California, came to fuck up the bank
I got the jewelry on me and it's drippin' in paint
And I ain't claim to be a saint, and I'm everything they ain't
I smoke 'til I can't, I smoke 'til I can't
Yeah, whoa, I smoke 'til I can't
Yeah, I smoke 'til I can't
Whoa, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ayy, Weezy left the family
All I used to bump was Weezy back in the Camry, damn
They don't see me break a sweat, they never understand me
Yeah, but I got ultimate faith in myself, you a Plan B
I work from LA to Miami, life a beach, shit, I love when it's sandy
Yeah, and I got too many bitches and y'all busy scramblin'
I go and make me a profit and spend it on gamblin'
I'm in the streets, the music industry shady, whoa
Just did a 180, they talk about me 'cause I signed up with Baby
I got a problem gettin' to the money, I'ma pull up on somebody, tell 'em to pay me
Get it out the mud, get a thousand pills, clients mad 'cause I ain't sellin' 'em lately
Lookin' at my wrist, lookin' at my bitch, people really underestimate me
I be myself and let the press debate me, they love me broke, I think it's best they hate me
When I hit the strip in Vegas, feelin' like I'm 2Pac, they wanna decimate me
I fuck her and don't even try, and I still impress her, baby
Whoa, I'm smokin' on broccoli
I go to sleep on top of the money with two girls on top of me

[Chorus]
I smoke 'til I can't, I smoke 'til I can't
I just left out of California with a car full of dank
I got the jewelry on me and it's wet like the paint
And I ain't claim to be a saint, bitch, I'm everything they ain't
I smoke 'til I can't, I smoke 'til I can't
Yeah, whoa, I smoke 'til I can't
Yeah, yeah, I smoke 'til I can't
Yeah, I smoke 'til I can't

[Outro]
We preach peace and love and tolerance, but we don't act on it. We say that this world is going to a shithole, but we are the reason why, because we do not accept others and their differences. We say we do, but our actions speak a lot louder than our words
