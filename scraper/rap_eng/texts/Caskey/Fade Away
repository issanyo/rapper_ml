[Verse 1: Denim White]
Got the baddest bitches in the city, boy
All my homies always riding with me, getting tipsy, boy
I'm so high in outer space so why don't you come and get me, boy?
I'ma fade away 'cause all this liquor, it done hit me, boy
Now watch 'em fade away, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, wait a minute
If I see it and I want it, homie, I'ma go and get it
You talk shit, but I done did it and I'm never gon' forget it
Got my logo on my fitted 'cause I'm all about my business
Woo! Yeah, yeah, yeah, never gonna stop now
Like my car like I like my bitches, with they top down
Fuck around, leave your brains leaking on the fucking ground
'nother 'round of shots for my homies from the underground
Now whoa! Watch, boy, this is how we do it, man
I love making this money, now I'm gon' go get back to it
I'm a winner, never losing and I had to pay my dues
Tell me how you undefeated, dog, I even let you choose, woo

[Hook: Denim White & Caskey]
Yeah, yeah, watch 'em fade away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, watch 'em fade away (Fade away)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Okay, fade away, I feel like Jordan in the fourth and fifth
I'm the O-town Willie Nelson, man, I gotta roll the spliff
From the east side, Lil Weezy, might just fuck with Juvenile
They gon' jock the whole damn swag, they know that I promote this style
Okay, I'm flexin', my Rollie rock
Hey, two hoes that I'm textin', they over the top
I'm overtly obsessed with outcomes
They always out there
All my enemies like, "How you ain't say sorry yet?"
Go check my latest album
Singing while on X, I'm like a mix of Drake and Malcolm
They try turn to Soulja Boy, I pull the Draco out (Whoa)
These days, rappers sold outs and they all made up, fa√ßade
Only two people I know gon' tell the truth, it's me and God
Okay, I'm bringing the guap in
I'm deading the beef, but homie, I'm willing to chop it
I left out the country
My bitch and my weed, they came from the tropics
So kill all the gossip
I know who I am, I don't feel agnostic
Ay, we gon' fade away, but dog, my soul is cosmic, hey

[Hook: Denim White]
Yeah, yeah, watch 'em fade away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, watch 'em fade away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
