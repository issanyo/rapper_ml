Verse 1:
Yea, Ok I'm fucked up
I ain't gun lie
Ima' drunk drive
Meditate,let the drunk ride
Ima dive deep
Levitate, but I ain't a mind freak
Get behind me
Then you on the right path
Check my time sheet
Reminds me, fucking 9 to 5 I just ride beats
9-5 pussy other time, Im on it
The other 5 don't exist they mit
Release chronic from my lips
Ima trip, you on it or you is missing the fuck out
Lucky I ain't catch a ride
Fuck all them blue and whites
Im tryna' catch a vibe
I got my baggage packed
Im feelin' mesmerized also intoxicated
And feelin' Im destined to rise
Pressure to pressurized
Reggie in lessen the vibe
So I, only keep the best to the left of my side
This is that, 400 ah zip
Im drunk as a bitch
Sippin' out the fifth til im motherfuckin' blended or im sunk in a seat

Hook:
This here (here)
Is one of them drunk nights (nights)
Im wildin' ,Eddie twist the blunt tight
Guess Im driving (driving)
I ain't tryna say that Im sober
So pray that them cops don't pull me over
Yea yea , cause then its over x4
(Cop talking: Over, we gotta-we gotta- we gotta 10-9-100, highly highly intoxicated driver, we have to pull him over)

Verse 2:
Drunk driving, swimmin' in the sea of the funk
Let me dive in
This is not doctor prescribed
I be vibin'
Double L shot of patron
No chase
That's the shit that have me frozen in space
Cold case
The whole eighth vanish with no trace
Manage its slow pace
Bitches rotate,like the wheels of my 08'
Smoke alot
Crop these hoes out of the picture like it was Photoshop
----- Oh shit, I think that's cops right behind me
(fuck) and I could run dog
But they'll find me
Shit, probably been swervin' for a minute
And that police car faster then my civic
Guess it's time for the...
DUI
Test,Ima walk lines
Guess it's better then gun shots and sharp lines
Took another sip, like shit it's hard times
Then looked up in my rear-view, that ain't ah cop!
So, fuck it!

So pray that them cops don't pull me over

(Cop talking: Driver is definitely intoxicated, emerging from lane to lane, ahh potently a hazard)

Verse 3:
I ain't wasted
Im in a in between groove
Where I could operate a vehicle smooth
Fully complacent,Yea
My momma swear I ain't gun make it
I continue to sip it and drive like she must be hatin'
Debatin' on whether or not, Im gun stop this
And whether the cops gun' watch this
Or let it go and just let me keep livin'
And then he went and made his decision
I saw the lights like fuck! (Police siren goes on)

(Ah fuck ) (Ah Shit)
(We are so fucked dude, my mom is gun' fucking kill me)
Caskey: Fuck how the fuck am I gun get out of this bro
(Police walks up to vehicle)
Police: Licence and registration please
Caskey: Officer I didn't do shit
Police: Licence and registration !

Police: Sir have you been drinking tonight?
Caskey: Officer what the fuck is that suppose to mean?
