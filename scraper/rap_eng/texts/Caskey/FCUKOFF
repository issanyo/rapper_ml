[Intro: SKYXXX]
Hello? Yeah
Yeah, feel like Chief Keef, nigga, Lil Reese, like Tay-K
Do what I want, ay, brr
Do what I want, skrr
Do what I want, fuck off
Yeah, fuck off, ay, yeah

[Hook: SKYXXX]
I'ma smoke my dope inside this bitch if I want
I might fuck somebody bitch inside this bitch if I want, ay
I come pull up with that stick if that's what he want
Now he acting different like that boy bipolar or somethin', ay

[Verse 1: SKYXXX]
I walk in the ghetty with a blunt in my mouth
Twitter thotty on the couch, sucking dick for some clout
Yeah, I used to keep that work inside the Crown Royal pouch
Yeah, I came in with that rain and they thought it was a drought
[?] dope soap, too much [?] toast to, rasta
Nostril, stuck to the paper like a postal, no shit
Better get the cake like Hostess, Hostess, quote this
Hit the boy with a quick scope, bitch, oh shit, coach this
I might get a check and spend that shit on the Lamb
I might swipe a gift card and go fuck up P.F. Chang's
There's a lot of shit y'all doing that I don't understand
Like you still ain't shot the shooter who went shot up your man
I was locked with your big homie, he told me you ain't gang, ay
That ain't no real diamonds and that ain't Johnny Dang, ay
You can't kick it with me, boy, you not Jackie Chan, ay
I feel like [?], did he teach how make a bang? Bang, bang!

[Hook: SKYXXX]
I'ma smoke my dope inside this bitch if I want
I might fuck somebody bitch inside this bitch if I want, ay
I come pull up with that stick if that's what he want
Now he acting different like that boy bipolar or somethin', ay
I'ma smoke my dope inside this bitch if I want

I come pull up with that stick if that's what he want
Now he acting different like that boy bipolar or somethin', ay

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Whoa, swoop on the bag like vultures
Pull up with a gun, no holsters, ay
Whoa, fucking on my bitch on sofas
Sucking and I ain't gotta coach her, ay
She want a role like ultra
Told her, "Gotta do it for the culture," what, oh
Gotta watch out for the cobras
Yeah, but I got a clique full of soldiers
Sticking my dick in a girl with a man
Whiter they come, but the Molly is tan
Got the drugs in the kitchen, they wrapped in Saran
Guns on the shelf like we come from Iran
Whoa, momma say I'm so outlandish
Whoa, in the hotel suite with the bandits
Package touchdown, here an advantage
Damage is done, man, I'm so hard to manage
I got the money that [?] advantage
And all of my bitches speak Spanish
And all of my homies, they loyal
You switch on me, you getting 'bandoned
Rolex on me like a wristband
I'm on that lean like a kickstand
That ain't my dog, that's my hitman
Go tell your bitch I'm a big fan

[Hook: SKYXXX]
I'ma smoke my dope inside this bitch if I want
I might fuck somebody bitch inside this bitch if I want, ay
I come pull up with that stick if that's what he want
Now he acting different like that boy bipolar or somethin', ay
