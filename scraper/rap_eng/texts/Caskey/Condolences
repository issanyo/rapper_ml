Lately everything I drop is murder. (Murder)

[Verse 1]
This unheard of. Lately every song I drop is murder being
Manifested
Y'all better stand corrected. Anorexic
Y'all can't swallow what ain't effective
Wallow in these weak rhymes they following
Hollowing the art form
Man its disrespectful every verse I give my heart for em
Man this just another part for em
Playing roles so I play them close
Reasoning with these fake rappers that shit like slaying
Ghosts
Lately I just pray the most
Hip hop need a savior
With a little soul like Anita Baker
And I need a Lakers jersey with the words “Kobe” on it
They know we on it. This game here owe me my moment
They probably know me by moments momentarily
Well soon enough this gone be they therapy
Man soon enough these rappers gone be trapped in
These parodies
Its such a paradigm, while they prepared to shine
A pair of dimes and I'm here stuck reminiscing with
Caroline
Candle lights, loaded, Im bloated, my life coded, my knife
Folded
These rappers who thinkin they nice, focus. Stay
Focused
Man this game here it ain't safe for em
So lately I just come to pray for em
Man you got to pray for em!

[Hook]
I send my condolences
Many rappers finna be slain when I first cop me a chain
First drop in this game. (ayeeee)
Their reign will never be the same man I swear that I got to
Pray for em! (pray for em)
I send my condolences
Many rappers finna be slain. Man I pray for em! (pray for
Em)
I send my condolences. Many rappers finna be slain

[Verse 2]
Man I'm just sitting on these rooftops
Listening to 2Pac and rolling up the oo-ops plotting
Seems they harden exterior’s all cotton and all rotten
Watching me grow
And they're making parallels between my life and how the
Prophecy go
Is it possibly so?
I mean he murder every 16 man it gotta be gold
Slow killings arise, got no feelings for lives lost
I learned that from Stunna he my boss
Man I am highly lost
This here is a journey I am learning from
My schedule is overbooked Im on the flight and burning
One
Exotic trips more politics
Plenty more chronic lit, Iconic shit
Acting Hollywood in my metropolis
Mix the Tropicana with the Grand Touring
Here I stand pouring it on top of the graves of my enemies
It ain't safe for em
So lately I just come to pray for em
Man you got to pray for em!

[Hook]
I send my condolences
Many rappers finna be slain when I first cop me a chain
First drop in this game. (ayeeee)
Their reign will never be the same man I swear that I got to
Pray for em! (pray for em)
I send my condolences
Many rappers finna be slain. Man I pray for em! (pray for
Em)
I send my condolences. Many rappers finna be slain

[Verse 3]
Bang! This is overkill
Murder. Let the odor instill
Man I got more dope shit to spill
Man I got more soldiers to kill
Man im getting colder still
Pentecostal, send them to Roscoes
Mix up the syrup with the waffles
Gotta eat rappers, keep rappers locked inside with no
Master key
Master minded. And I'm actively grinding
These rappers passing away, faster than I be ashing these
J’s
And I keep em packed up with K
And while im rolling this I just send a toast to the ghosts
Homie I send my condolences
