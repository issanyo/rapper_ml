[Chorus]
Seem like I hate myself, I love myself, I hate myself
Mind state so undecisive, run the dices
We in a time where every man that's walkin' got a hunnid vices
The country that we in is fucked up, man
I guess that's why some people run to ISIS
But violence ain't the answer, it divide us
What the people really need is guidance
Feel like DJ Khaled, homie, we the hottest
But we ain't like everybody, we be modest
Got the money for the cars and the chains
But I spend my time in peace and silence
Smokin' on a high hemp
Tryna meditate, man, we tryna reach the islands
Black Sheep, they only see defiance
God is good but shit we needed science

[Verse 1]
Trump in the office, racism still alive
Man, that shit kill the vibe
Tell them neo-nazis, "Suck a dick and die"
I'm on acid now, Lucy in the sky
Feel like Jesus Christ, he was crucified
People hate the truth, when they used to lies
Gotta take your ego, get it euthanized
'Bout our business but we ain't in suit and ties
Lie 'bout yourself
That's initiation into our whole generation
This was a soul innovation
I scraped the bowl, start my goal penetration
I look at rappers and want to change occupations
Nowadays, you get more likes for the confrontation
Than for dope shit and compilations
Ya'll soundin' soul-less in conversations
There's way too much hatred and gossip
You end up on World Star, in the Shade Room
They start to think that you poppin'
Look at them jeans, now they Robin
You went to dealer and robbed him
Dancin' with demons and goblins
We don't see it 'cause we too entangled in the comments
You on the percs and the lean too much
Our generation probably seein' too much
Fifth graders with a iPhone
Information overload is bein' too much
Got us disconnected with our own self
But we see a lot of people through the screen
We don't do shit, all we do is dream
Man, rest in peace to Martin Luther King

[Chorus]
See I hate myself, I love myself, I hate myself
Mind frame so undecisive, run the dices
In a time where every man that's walkin' got a hunnidvices
Country that we in is fucked up, man
I guess that's why some people run to ISIS
But violence ain't the answer, it divide us
What the people really need is guidance
Feel like DJ Khaled, homie, we the hottest
Ain't like everybody, we be modest
Got the money for the cars and the chains
But I spend my time in peace and silence
Smokin' on a high hemp
Tryna get to Puerto Rico, wanna see the islands
Black Sheep, they only see defiance
God is good but shit we needed science

[Verse 2]
If I have a son, I'ma tell him run
Try and get far away, we are not the ones
Lookin' at these people, we got lots of guns
Gotta be the light, you can't stop the sun, yeah
And we talk to ourselves
'Cause you don't feel safe when the coppers come
No surprise that we poppin' one
I look in the mirror, don't know who I've become
Used to feel like I had answers
Now my mind is like a cancer
Dollar bills on dirty dancers, undercover money transfers
Devils dancin' to the samples
He make an appointment and he never cancels
Temptation turnin' ampler
I tried to be the world's candle
They put me out and turned me to an animal
Too in love with diamonds, I've been over-shinin'
Need to see my people, I've been over-timin'
What's the purpose? Never see my homies now
Been had a kid and I ain't hold him down
People lookin' at me like the Golden Child
But I made mistakes and they go for miles
Down on myself, never show a smile
When I die, I pray that I'ma go in style
But I ain't perfect
Walk through this earth like everyone findin' a purpose
I found it in music
Sometimes your blessings come with the curses
God don't always give you mercy
Sometimes you gotta endure the pain to show you worthy
Every nation on my jersey, go to God and say I'm thirsty

[Chorus]
That's why I hate myself, I love myself, I hate myself
Try and not be undecisive, run the dices
In a time where every man that's walkin' got a hunnid vices
The people that we are, fucked up, man
I guess that's why some people run to ISIS
Violence ain't the answer, it divide us
What the people really need is guidance
Feel like DJ Khaled, homie, we the hottest
Not like everybody, we be modest
Got the money for the cars and the chains
But I spend my time in peace and silence
Smokin' on a high hemp
Tryna get to Indonesia, wanna see the islands
Black Sheep, they only see defiance
God is good but shit we needed science

[Outro]
This just a letter to the people to remember that the power's in your hands
Black Sheep
