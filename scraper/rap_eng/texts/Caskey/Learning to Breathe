[Verse 1]
Codeine, my habits
If I die from sippin', don't forget me
On the phone with no one special
Just the devil, he gon' tempt me
Look me in my eyes and tell me
That pain only temporary
I guess time will tell
But I ain't cracked a smile since January

[Chorus]
Drownin'
Drownin', oh
I'm back on this floor once again
This bottle my only friend
Drownin'
Drownin', oh
I'm back on this floor once again
This bottle my only friend

[Verse 2]
Candle lights surround me
I've been on one since you found me
Tell me pain is temporary
Ain't seen you since February
I took you in my home
When you were in vulnerable places
And that's not how you replace this

[Chorus]
That's why
Drownin'
Drownin', oh
I'm back on this floor once again
This bottle my only friend
Drownin'
Drownin', oh
I'm back on this floor once again
This bottle my only friend
