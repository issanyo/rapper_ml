[Intro: HD]
You know they sniping from up top

[Hook: HD]
Kush, blowing it like the way I want
Young nigga, sauce drippin', you know I brought the sauce
That stick, dolo, riding solo, shooters on the roof
Them white boys, they Kyle Korver, snipe
Kush, blowing it like the way I want
Young nigga, sauce drippin', you know I brought the sauce
That stick, dolo, riding solo, shooters on the roof
Them white boys, they Kyle Korver, snipe

[Verse 1: HD]
Uh uh, hold up, fuck up, let the nigga run up
He gon' get sniped 'fore he come up
High IQ, go get it, swag ignant
Blunt splitting, sauce, when I talk, cat drippin'
Gifted, make the lil nigga get missin'
That paper had they ass at attention, fuck 'em up
Fuck 'em up, hold it (Hold it)
Jae hit 'em with the yacht, Chris coming with extensions
She-she-she fucking like it's nothin', silly ass nigga still cuffin'
Gold on instinct, hard in the paint, Andre Drummond, fuck it, whoa
I don't need no motivation, my son turned two the other day
Straight up, I need 500 K before my nigga leave pre-K, fuck it
Burberry locs stay tinted, behave
No shame but amazing grace, nigga, this base
Fo' flat, pacing to the check
Tryna Paul George ball, had to flock on the finesse, huh
Popping ass niggas, I gotta eat
I ain't rocking with you niggas, blocking ass niggas
I'm sick and tired of all these lil straight-cheese-no-topping ass niggas
Back to crackers, blitz, white boys on the roof
Straight [?] on a nigga
Bitch better hit my pager, Stojakin' on a nigga, ugh, sniper
Dirt for your honor, straight dunking [?]
Kick the cash out, he gon' snipe
Catch a nigga stepping with a milla
I ain't even talking [?] like Mike, ugh

[Hook: HD]
Kush, blowing it like the way I want
Young nigga, sauce drippin', you know I brought the sauce
That stick, dolo, riding solo, shooters on the roof
Them white boys, they Kyle Korver, snipe
Kush, blowing it like the way I want
Young nigga, sauce drippin', you know I brought the sauce
That stick, dolo, riding solo, shooters on the roof
Them white boys, they Kyle Korver, snipe

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Pull up, I'm clutching the steel, rolling and sucking the pill
Fucking my girl on a hill, she 'bout as great as a seal
And I done trained her to kill, I ain't been tainted by hatred
I roll 'round and still give out love 'cause that shit is so sacred
Still rappers is vacant when I show up outside they crib
Talk all that shit there online, where you is?
Man, these bitches better make way, HD got the HK
We done set it off, till then, Hurricane Chris
Many "a bay bays," holler, "Mayday"
You better off in school with a AA
Nerd ass rappers, dropping all these mixtapes online
I-ain't-even-heard ass rappers
I'm sick and tired of all these in-last-place-never-first ass rappers
Word to Ralph Flex, white boys on the roof
And my dog, Touch, see the truth
I ain't never seen him rocking with a lil ass gun like a two-two
He got the stick and he put it on you too
Mama told me, "Keep the Mossberg in the closet"
I'm outside, making you a target
Here to end all the lil bullshit you done started
Man, someone say something to my shorty
I'll be testing out the brand new forty
Rappers always talking what they can do for me
I'm good here without y'all (I ain't worried)
My crew full of outlaws (I ain't worried)
Yo' crew making out calls
Seem like everything about y'all pussy
You always on my man, no hoodie, no tea, no Skittle
We set records with the shot, three point line, no dribble, snipe

[Hook: HD]
Kush, blowing it like the way I want
Young nigga, sauce drippin', you know I brought the sauce
That stick, dolo, riding solo, shooters on the roof
Them white boys, they Kyle Korver, snipe
Kush, blowing it like the way I want
Young nigga, sauce drippin', you know I brought the sauce
That stick, dolo, riding solo, shooters on the roof
Them white boys, they Kyle Korver, snipe
