[Verse]
Some shit just don't rub you right when you first hear about it
Like lookin' at the Freshman List, your name ain't on the ballot, man
I'm lookin' at the piece on my side, I can't go nowhere without it
People always tryna run up on somebody, get some clout, and
I've been in and in and out the bank, in and out the bank
Wonder what my mind is on, it's not what you think
I'm blowin' out the big gas, all I smoke is dank
These rappers tryna formulate, I love this shit, I fornicate
I'm playin' with the kitty, finger fuckin' on the money
Every blunt cost me a check, like I'm smokin' out a hunnid
Sorry bae, wanna come 'round, but this here Ferrari play
Meanin' every sixty seconds, I go so, so far away
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, dog, ya heard
How I met this girl on fourth of July, but fucked her on the third?
How I feel like DJ Khaled? I got all my bags secured
How I went and grew some wings when all my dogs was pitchin' birds?

[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah
Nothing that you go through ever gonna stay, ayy, yeah
And I've been going through it, so I'm tryna get this K, ayy, yeah
Nothing that you go through ever gonna stay, ayy, yeah
