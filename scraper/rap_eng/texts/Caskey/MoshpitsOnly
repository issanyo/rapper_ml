[Hook: Tyla Yaweh]
I can't trust a soul
Everyone is fake in this world
Fake in this world, no more
'Cause I can't trust a soul no more
Which way do I go?
I can't trust a soul no more, soul no more
Gotta alter [?]
I can't trust a soul
I can't trust a soul

[Verse 1: SKYXXX]
I just popped a Xan
I pour the lean by the fo'
I just copped a gram
And I can't feel my nose
I think I'm the man
Got yo' bitch on my phone
Why I do these drugs?
'Cause I can't trust a soul
I just been balling, now I'm balling, now I'm rollin'
Balling, now I'm balling, now I'm rollin'
We in yo' club, chilling on a pole
Pour me up a deuce of the potion
Yeah, I move in slow motion

[Hook: Tyla Yaweh]
I can't trust a soul
Everyone is fake in this world
Fake in this world, no more
'Cause I can't trust a soul no more
Which way do I go?
I can't trust a soul no more, soul no more
Gotta alter [?]
I can't trust a soul

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Ok, I can't trust a soul, so you won't catch me at the spot
And I got the Ruger with me 'cause they always turn the plot
These rappers ain't ya homies, man, they only want ya spot
And these bitches, they gon' suck yo' dick long you rest on the top
We got the kilos on the table, true that
We got choppers at the trap house, true that
Yeah, my partner got the blue pills, true that
I pled, nobody let the rats out, true that, ok
Xan in my cup, I'm serving, I'm plottin'
I can't fuck with the groupie bitches 'cause they watchin'
Trap on Instagram and I'm serving, getting nonsense
These people fake as fuck so when you see 'em, just pop them!

[Hook: Tyla Yaweh]
I can't trust a soul
Everyone is fake in this world
Fake in this world, no more
'Cause I can't trust a soul no more
Which way do I go?
I can't trust a soul no more, soul no more
Gotta alter [?]
I can't trust a soul
