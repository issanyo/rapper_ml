[Chorus]
Damage in yo' eyes
Took me to a far off place where there's nowhere to survive
We're runnin' out of time, damage in yo' eyes, eyes
Damage in yo' eyes
Let's me know we're runnin' out of time
Damage in yo' eyes
Let's me know we're runnin' out of time
There's damage all in yo' eyes
Damage in yo' eyes

[Verse]
Take me 'way from the lonely place, light a candle
You know I've always been too much to handle
The way you touch me feel like a nightmare
You left me, but when you call, I'll be right there
It's a shame, yeah
How ya live, and I feel rearranged, yeah

[Chorus]
All because that damage in yo' eyes
Took me to a far off place where there's nowhere to survive
We're runnin' out of time, damage in yo' eyes, eyes
Damage in yo' eyes
Let's me know we're runnin' out of time
Damage in yo' eyes
Let's me know we're runnin' out of time
There's damage all in yo' eyes
Damage in yo' eyes
