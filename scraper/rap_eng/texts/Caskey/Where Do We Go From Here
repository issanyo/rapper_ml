[Verse 1]
I already know that I’m an asshole
Gotta be careful about the shit that you say cuz you always gonna get what you ask for (what you ask for)
Steppin' outside through the backdoor
I remember scoopin’ you in the black ford
Now you’re worldwide got stamps on the passport
You the whole reason that I rap more
Got me goin’ crazy in the booth babe
Ridin’ solo in the city
All the bad things that I done tryin’ to forget about your name
Man I pray the lord forgive me
I’m startin’ up the hemi
Bad bitches man I know plenty
Rich guys bet you know plenty
But women like you and guys like me
Besides the two of us I don’t think I  know any

[Hook]
And I know I said some fuck shit
But I didn’t mean those thangs
Know I put it all in your face
When you ain't’ wanna see those thangs
Now you got me all at the house
Startin’ to make me so strange
I know I know I said a lot of fuck shit
But I didn’t mean those thangs
Where do we go from here (x3)
Where do we go (x2)
Where do we go from here
I know I put it all in your face
When you ain’t wanna see those thangs

[Verse 2]
Already know that I’m an asshole
Always said that you wanna be free
And you always gonna get what you ask for
In and out of the terminal tryin’ to find ya
Maybe you just needed a reminder
Yeah I know you love sex but doggy style ain’t the only time you gonna need someone behind ya
Yeah girl and you be
You be playin’ my emotions
Tell me not to call you or  text you or tweet you
The next day the call lines open (what the fuck)
I made a plan put it into motion
You made a plan for crossing over oceans
I was sour about it like the shit I’m smokin’
But I had to let you go to show you my devotion

[Hook]
Yeah And I know I said some fuck shit
But I didn’t mean those thangs
Know I put it all in your face
When you ain't’ wanna see those thangs
Now you got me locked in the house
Startin’ to make me so strange
I know I know I said a lot of fuck shit
But I didn’t mean those thangs
Where do we go from here (x3)
Where do we go (x2)
Where do we go from here
Cuz I didn’t mean those thangs (x2)
Girl, you know, I didn't’ mean those thangs (x2)
