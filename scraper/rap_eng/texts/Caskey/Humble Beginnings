[Pre-Hook: Innocent]
A couple charms hanging on me
Got designer on my body
Keep a couple theezies waiting on me
Stay smoking something heavy
Fleek from head to toe, bro, catch me
Riding nothing less than two cars deep

[Hook: Innocent]
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, headed straight to the top
So much cheddar in my future, my dough just don't stop
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, coming straight off the block
Came from humble beginnings, school of hard knocks, yeah

[Verse 1: Dre Domo]
They see me all over the internet like, "How he do that shit?"
They put that bag behind the kid, yeah, in Domo they trust
On some Cash Money shit the way the youngins coming up
Yeah, Hot Boy, ain't no cooling, nah
You want ft with me, catch me out, it ain't no love
It's that young singing nigga, bring it, ask your man [?]
I get lit then break one off, check my catalog
Be that [?] they love and I got hair like I'm Mulan, yeah
Smoke like Cheech & Chong, big blunt, don't do no bong
And nobody had to tell me, I been knew I was the shit
On the track going stupid, Stephen Curry with the clip
In the booth, mass shoot up, calling mine Freddy Krugar
That's just murder

Came from humble beginnings, school of hard knocks, yeah

[Verse 2: Casper]
I ain't have a day one
They been tryin' to play up
They been tryin' to run game
I ain't fuck with a scrub
Y'all should know how we come
Big moves, small talk
Low key, big dog, 20K in a week
Y'all should see me work hard
I ain't gotta work hard
Pull up, the youngin been poppin'
I leave they ass with no option
I don't do none of that talkin'
All of my women be foreign
Roll up the che, yeah, we go in
[?] VVS glowin'
I think they already know it
Profit is all I be holdin'
All at the top of the totem
No, we ain't ever gon' slow it

[Verse 3: Caskey]
No, we ain't ever gon' fold it
Yeah, they say that crack kills
But they didn't tell me 'bout the vac seals
What's a youngin s'posed to do but stack bills
Tryin' to crack deals
Have knots but ironic that I never lack pills
Fade the coke and crush a Advil
He was slipping, guess he made a bad deal
Tryin' to max still
Flashback 2009, I had the pack still
Man, you fake as fuck, you only act real
Y'all some Brad Pitts, I'm [?]
Got the bad fist
Hop off the bike, I'ma lean like a kickstand
Hit it with soap and count up the dope with my whip hand
My pot needs to hustle, so I idolize the brick man
When I die, be a rich man
On the road, I'm getting head in a lick van
Diamonds sitting on my wrist like a mofucking wristband
Someone call up El Chapo, say him I'm a big fan
