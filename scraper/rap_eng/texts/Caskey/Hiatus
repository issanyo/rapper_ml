[Intro: Sample]
Tell me who you hang out with, I'll tell who you are
Who are your friends?
Who are your buddies?
Who are your hood?
Who do you hang out with?
Who do you love hanging out with?
Where do you love hanging out?
Who are your friends, really?
A friend is a mirror unto you
If you were to look at your friend, you should see yourself
(It happened in 1947)

[Hook]
Don't fuck 'round with my clique
My dogs, they off the shits
Don't fuck 'round with my clique
I'm always on the shits
Don't fuck 'round with my clique

[Verse 1]
We the realest ones out, point blank, period
We the ones who built the pyramids
We the ones who put in work
People say they coming for me and my spot
I can't take 'em serious
I'm a Cash Money Records star and y'all delirious
Me and Bird going to Mars
Smoking on moon rock we got from the stars
Some of y'all be so obsessed with yourself
That your ego the only thing large
I just pulled up to the coast
Mike got an eighth and we put it in raws
Popping the bar with these rappers
I came a long way from just rappin' in bars
Came a long way from the action and scars
I got the gas and I'm pushing the nozzle
Back in the day when I ran from the cops
No father figure, I looked up to Nas
No politicking, I lived with the gods
Now it's me and my homies and Bird
Your bitch getting all the attention and you get the curve
Thankful I know when to swerve

[Pre-Hook]
I'm back from my hiatus
I know we gonna answer people's runs, they finna hate us
I know some people talking 'bout my team like they done made us
They must want meet they makers, I could deal with haters

[Hook]
Just don't fuck 'round with my clique
My dogs, they off the shits
Don't fuck 'round with my clique
I'm always on the shits
Don't fuck 'round with my clique

[Verse 2]
Banging doors off the hinges, I don't need permission
Lawyers calling me up daily, someone on a mission
I don't owe you no commission
People swear that they on lifeline until you missin'
And everything start to lift off when you without 'em
Now is that me dissing or is that the truth?
I had some haters, shit
Back in the day when I was just a child, a youth
Back when my smile was missing a tooth
Look at me mama, I made it from out of the struggle
And did this shit all out the booth
Someone gon' jeopardize it, tryin' to bring down the house
I'ma put a shooter on the roof
I'ma have guns hiding at the crib
Take out everybody but the kid
I want Taz's Angels in the club
I'm in 305, can I live?
I just might pop me a Xan'
I know that some people gon' hate it the second we drop
But you know I'm the man
And I got my team with me like we planned

[Pre-Hook]
I'm back from my hiatus
I know we gonna answer people's runs, they finna hate us
I know some people talking 'bout my team like they done made us
They must want meet they makers, I could deal with haters

[Hook]
Just don't fuck 'round with my clique
My dogs, they off the shits
Don't fuck 'round with my clique
I'm always on the shits
Don't fuck 'round with my clique
