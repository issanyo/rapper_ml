[Intro]
I'm addicted to progress
Just found out

[Hook]
Whoa, I dip in that 'Rarri, ain't no need to stall
I spaz on these pussies, I ain't at the mall
I get to the money, I just want it all
How you a killer? My killers on call
Check and I'm getting them all
Fuck you, lil bitch, I'ma act like they are
Can't get a piece, yeah, I just want it all
Fuck what they talking 'bout, I put it on

[Verse 1]
Blood on my shirt
We old school with trapping, we all got a chirp
In the booth, I'm sipping syrup
My grandmama know, you got to see the gumption
I got a high IQ but I didn't drop out and I be on some dumb shit
GTV, I swerve, all the hating never hit a nerve
Bitch, I'm getting money like Bird
How Lil Kim [?]
All that fuck shit getting curved
Bitch, I'm a learner, but I stay with the burner
Don't turn this shit to a murder, you know I got it, unheard of
I don't chase these hoes, I chase my check
Work on the phone, gotta give me one sec
[?] just did the money dance to the bank
Had to buy a new Rolex, fuck them all, collarbone flex
Got two bad bitches and I send 'em both texts
At the end of the night we gon' have slow sex

[Hook]
Whoa, I dip in that 'Rarri, ain't no need to stall
I spaz on these pussies, I ain't at the mall
I come for the check 'cause I just want it all
How you a killer? My killers on call
I spaz on the pussies, I'm gettin' it all
Ain't no need to get it 'less you gettin' it all
I fuck up a check 'cause I just want it all
How you a killer? My killers on call

[Verse 2]
'Rarri, 'fore you walk, gotta learn how to crawl
Molly, getting so high that I'm above the law
Won't talk shit, get flat-lined, turn the lights off, it's nap time
Take your ice off, I'm the bad guy, fuck a bitch, I don't pay for the cab ride
Got deposit on text, just might spoil my bitch
Feel good when you got counterfeit money, but it ain't like this
Next week, I'ma call my jeweler up and damn near spoil my wrist
People see the technique, try to duplicate, but it all gon' miss
'Cause we working hard for this shit, this wasn't overnight
Seen all the dope that you selling, that shit look overpriced
I'm high off of life, this is sober life, I'm fucking my bitch with the lights on
Even when we got the lights off, still could tell that we got ice on

[Hook]
Whoa, I dip in that 'Rarri, ain't no need to stall
I spaz on these pussies, I ain't at the mall
We been in the Empire, they never fall
We come for the check 'cause I just need it all
I get to the check, I'ma go put it on
I spaz on these pussies, they know that they are
How you a killer? My killers on call
Fuck what they talking 'bout, I put it on
