[Verse 1: Tompson]
I got five bills to my name
And I think I need four for rent
I've been really wishing I had more to spend
Only thought to my mind, cop a quarter zip
Fuck that, give it up, been flipping work
This year, man, I gotta put spitting first
Roll it up and I hit the purp
Then I jump in the booth, start spitting 'til my vision blurred
So much time came and went
I'm pissed off I ain't made a hit
But I know, my voice can't take the shit
I gotta grab my pen, I gotta break my wrist
Downtown, put your hands up
Like this pen is my gun and I'm aiming at the crowd
And I worked so hard just to get right here
If I get my shot, ain't no way I'm backing down
Six years of killing this flow
I can feel 'em hating on the low
Why they caring how I live my life?
You never gave a fuck when I was broke, dough
Bitch, you know what I do with the pen
I gotta get back to it again
And sometimes, man, you gotta be through with some friends
'cause they don't wanna see you move in a Benz
Bitch, find the hustle, count your profit
Learn to bounce back if you take them losses
Got your hands out, I ain't gave those options
Said that I changed, I'm the same old Tompson
Woo! That go for anybody tryin' to run game on Tompson
Killing the game the way I lay these coffins
Keep my name in your mouth, bitch, you crave on gossip, I know

[Hook: Tompson]
You can keep on acting like a hoe
I guarantee that never make your money grow
The way I get up here and beast up on the flow
Will never ever be the reason, I'm the GOAT

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Money keep coming, in love with the gualas
She look at my neck piece, she ready to swallow
My neck two hunnid thousand, off twenty dollars
I look at my mind state, it's just like a scholar
My problem? Ay
Ain't never been bitches or money, I stuck at the bottom
My problem? (What?)
Ain't none of the people who crossed me, already forgot 'em
I get that shit in
The dough that I got, don't need to be at the trap house
But it's like a drug
They come to my shows and black out
The guns that I got
Don't be posted on the internet
You start to do that
It's saying something 'bout your intellect
Eighteen years old I was tryna get a check, ay
Shooting at me, but it's indirect, ay
One day, our paths gonna intersect, ay
And we don't take kindly to disrespect, ay
Lil bitty bitch, what you know 'bout moving fish?
Time of the essence, I looked at my wrist
How I just made all of this off a diss?
Biscuit, I ride with a biscuit
Move on the low like a mystic
Try to fuck with you, but I couldn't risk it
I gotta go, keep my distance
Ay, y'all say you a real one, you talk like some bitches
That shit ain't gon' bring you riches
Me and Tompson 'bout to fuck on your missus

[Hook: Tompson]
You can keep on acting like a hoe
I guarantee that never make your money grow
The way I get up here and beast up on the flow
Will never ever be the reason, I'm the GOAT
