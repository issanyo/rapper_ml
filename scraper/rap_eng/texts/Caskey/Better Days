[Chorus: Kidd Steeze]
Ay, we done seen some better days
Swerving through the city, switching lanes
I'ma smoke the whole thing to my face
Cuts all on my wrist, ain't talking pain
Ay, we've been praying better days
Wish you weren't fucking for the fame
Smoking on the dope just like I'm [?]
We've been praying, praying better days

[Verse 1: Kidd Steeze]
Swerving through the city, switching lanes
Do the whole dash in the coupe just like I'm Dame
I wanna get it like right now, tech got a squad [?]
Running this shit, no time out, look at my neck, get iced out
Ay, we've been praying better days
Me and you are not the same, got the money, never changed, ay
You, you been frauding what you claim
Rolling up then got the daze, smoking dope and, yeah, no fade
Yeah, she fuck me all the time, she only fuck me for the (car, ay)
Baby, what you (ah ay) I could take you (ah ay)
Rolling, rolling, rolling, we've been floating through the clouds
Baby girl, don't make a sound, you can call when you around

[Chorus: Kidd Steeze]
Ay, we done seen some better days
Swerving through the city, switching lanes
I'ma smoke the whole thing to my face
Cuts all on my wrist, ain't talking pain
Ay, we've been praying better days
Wish you weren't fucking for the fame
Smoking on the dope just like I'm [?]
We've been praying, praying better days

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Ay, I've been praying for some better days
Maneuvering through life is like a maze
I'm high, smoking on the purple haze
Shorty struggling to keep the pace
I'm checked up, I'm struggling to catch up
I'm messed up, in the rave and blessed up, yeah
All I talk is real 'cause that all that resonate
I'm feeling like a Buddha in the pussy, meditate
I'm high off the money 'cause it made me levitate
I travel 'round the country and I'm driving in a wraith, yeah
Stack the money, that fuck shit isn't funny
If I wife a bad bitch, she gon' be a Playboy bunny
Man, I run the game, bitch, but I'm never, ever runnin'
Ay, ay, yeah, getting paid
I can't lie, we seen some better days

[Chorus: Kidd Steeze]
Ay, we done seen some better days
Swerving through the city, switching lanes
I'ma smoke the whole thing to my face
Cuts all on my wrist, ain't talking pain
Ay, we've been praying better days
Wish you weren't fucking for the fame
Smoking on the dope just like I'm [?]
We've been praying, praying better days
