Too much information (Come on!)
Too much information (Come on!)
Too much information (Come on!)
Too much information (Come on!)
(Are you blind people?)
How did we make it this far?
(Do you understand that mankind is being pitted against mankind?)
How did we make it this far?
(In a battle so intense that brother and sister are unrecognizable!)
How did we make it this far?
(It's chaos, the end times are surely near)
How did we make it this far?

[Verse 1]
Times of evolution, evolve to times of revolution
I'm here in a time full of mass confusion
Saying my goodbyes at the last reunion
I don't want to be the one to pass the blueprint
I say lay waste to the institutions
Give 'em a little taste of what angst of youth is, and truth is...
Truth is, we been putting up with too much for too long
Every time somebody say they good, I say "Boy, what is you on?"
What I do, move on? I ain't got no heart when I do wrong
Me, I been worried 'bout mine, shuffling coupons
Times are low, everybody under mind control
One of my brothers snorting lines of blow
He say he waiting for the signs to show
It make you wonder all the secrets that the Mayans know
Where are the pyramids from?
Why it's been so many years and we can't make them?
Shit, you make cars that'll run off water? Well they'll take them
Break them, shit it all boils down to some questions
Be careful of the shit you invest in, shit'll give you bad vibes
Lies you could feel in your intestines
Me, I ain't worried 'bout impressing nobody
I'm one mind, got no body
A man gotta stand and learn to be a man on his own
Do what you wanna do, it's your body
Still we all connected, ironic how from our perspective
We'll see the disconnection, the intersection
We ain't choose who was elected
So how the fuck we gon' respect it?
Are you getting the message? Sucka

(Do you not see it? The...)
How did we make it this far?
(Let me tell you something, the top one percent in this country make more than the bottom fifty combined)
How did we make it this far?
How did we make it this far?
(Do you understand the implications here, people?
The middle class is disappearing right before our eyes!)
How did we make it this far?

[Verse 2]
I am here at the bottom of the money pit in Nova Scotia, blowin' doja
Excuse my hydraulics, ain't mean to encroach on
All your down time, but I approach ya
With means to coach ya, what you wanna be, the roaches
Who ain't got no culture?
Who is alive that lack drive and focus
And work and survive just to drive a Focus?
Well me, I am focused on my soul (Get 'em)
So much of this in my bowl (Get 'em)
Psilocybin on plates (Get 'em)
One of us must indulge (Get 'em)
One of us is the clone (Get 'em)
Ain't nobody wanna be alone
Probably don't believe they been tapping our phones
Watching TVs, taking out loans
Make it hard to see what's outside of the home
Ever heard about Lebanon?
Probably wanna be the upper echelon
But you probably waiting 'round for Leprechauns
Ain't got a clue what it take, the steps to find the right path
Was I left behind?
Part Aryan and Sumerian
And what I'm carryin' is protectin' mine
I am the apocalypse to a novelist, bang, bang!
Hollow tips, tear all through your face but your first 48
Gon' be like building 7
Ain't nobody gon' acknowledge it
Have you ever seen Zeitgeist?
Ever seen a bright light?
Has the President ever looked a lil bit honest in the right light
On the right night? Sucka, nah

(Uh, I was, I was allowed access into Area 51 for a, uh, a brief amount of time)
How did we make it this far?
How did we make it this far?
(And uh, it's an interesting, an interesting operation)
How did we make it this far?
How did we make it this far?
(The uh, extraterrestrial contact has been established between the United States, uh, for quite some time now, and, uh, it's amazing the, uh, amount of technological advances, and social advances that they have guided. Uh, the American people, they're just unaware completely of what's going on in front of their face.)
