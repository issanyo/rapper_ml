[Verse 1]
Yeah, know yourself, know your worth
Need to focus on your craft, y'all too focused on the percs
I'm in love with the hustle, shout out Lil Uzi Vert
Thugger Thugger, Lil Durk, every rapper who inspire me to work
Work, I work like I'm Weezy in '09
Cash Money Records did it again, they found 'em a goldmine
Old heads saying every time I spit remind 'em of old times
Back when rappers really had something to say, they was pitching the cold lines
I promise I won't stop, I turn my hotel to a smoke shop
Third grade, I was in the backseat of my older sister [?] drive
How I learn how to hustle, I guess I got it from my pops
Posted up in the trap, the Florida Mall ain't the only place to shop

[Chorus]
Yeah, know yourself, know your worth
Posted up in the vert, I had to get it out the dirt
Yeah, I figured out nothing come easy, to get it is work
Yeah, don't nothing come easy, to get it is work

[Verse 2]
I put my town on the map
I just exceeded the cap, I'm running circles and lap
Y'all spending way too much time on your cell phones, working all of your apps
And you ain't busy hustling and making multiple traps
[?] Rollie, this isn't tithes, but it's holy
How many times I was there ignorin' the signs I was praying God to show me?
How many times I was at a hotel when a groupie said she know me?
How she ain't like the girl she roll with? How she ain't got no other motives?
How she'll turn into something she would never be? That was false promotion
Yeah, she saw a future with me, I left the altar wide open
You should've caught my other notions, my jewelry closet like a ocean
This a zone we could coast in, I'm the only one chosen

[Chorus]
Know yourself, know your worth
Posted up in the vert, I had to get it out the dirt
Yeah, I figured out nothing come easy, to get it is work
Yeah, don't nothing come easy, to get it is work

[Outro]
To get it is work, work, work, oh
To get it is work, yeah
