Keep this fuckin' shit on the low, bitch

Can you keep this on the low?
I got a girl back in my place
And I ain't tryin to complain she do what she do okay she my age
But you a queen, been lost in the thighs in your jeans
My work devise in the scheme
Of how you and me can go down town if you know what I mean
Sexual, probably say I'm a professional
Oh, the way I see you the next to know
I've been coming, you the next to blow
Hoping it's me on time, like the metronome
You a freak get the extra dome, we do more than the X and O
Do it all but I really think it's best you know
It's gotta be on the low

Chorus:
I'm really so for it baby, something on my mind
Wanna put you on the sofa darlin'
You can get it tonight, girl (it's gotta be on the low)
I'mma do what you want with your body
I ain't put it no fire
You can get it like you want, where you want
And the one can ..and keep it on the low

Yeah!

Gotta keep this on the low

Now tell me bout your fantasies
Tryin to drip it low with my body
You wet enough for the two of us, I hear the Bacardi
I'm loving the way that you party
Thinking that our combination supposed to be naughty
Tell me what you thinking bout it
Closer the fact, and we can think bout it
You know how I'll be cloud it
You the one that like to talk, I'll just be about it
I don't say a word, but can I heat it real early
Till the day cold in the morning
Cleaner than a Drake verse, but she oh so dirty
And shit about the pop all
First thing was the shirt so the top off
I posed it, send it for the next goal
..one thing that you gotta know
It's gotta be on the low

Chorus:
I'm really so for it baby, something on my mind
Wanna put you on yourself a dollar
You can get it tonight, girl (it's gotta be on the low)
I'mma do what you want with your body
I ain't put it no fire
You can get it like you want, where you want
And the one can ..and keep it on the low
Yeah yeah
Low low, yeah yeah
You gotta keep it on the low, low low

Hey y'all, in the middle of the night, yeah
Will be lovers at the part time
Lockin in the bedrooms with the hand cups with the desperate
Have you doing hard time
..the punishment, and I love the way that you've been send my government
To say some of it, I'll give you the old thing
Just get the little thing get on the side
I'm a grown man, and I'm good like the sexes
When you talk loud you accumulate exes
Saving for the young, but that shit reckless
Man my tongue..with your necklace
You can feel the asses, I'm a freak
Y'all, you a beauty I'mma need more
Deep hard, you got a deep soul
And I'm a deep deep.. deep low
