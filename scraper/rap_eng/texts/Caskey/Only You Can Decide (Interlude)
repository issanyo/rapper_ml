[Chorus]
Generation got our head in the clouds, we're livin' in the stars
Only you can decide which way we'll play with the cards (ayy)
Are we destined just to die on Earth? Will we make it out to Mars?
Only you can decide which way we'll play with the cards

[Verse]
Spaced out, high once again
On a dark path, only light is within
I'm high, tryna reach Zen
I took another five, I'm already on ten
The thing about life, feel like it never end
Until our day come and it's gone like the wind
We all feel a sense that it's all permanent
But you know it's up for rent

[Chorus]
When the time comes, gotta pay the charge
Only you can decide which way we'll play with the cards
Are you destined for bigger things? Are you nothin' more than a scar?
Only you can decide which way we'll play with the stars

[Outro]
Only you can decide. Only you can decide which way we decide to play with the cards we're dealt. But it's hard, you know? It's like bein' caught in this world that we didn't determine, we didn't create. Bein' forced into a fast life full of money, drugs, and um, vices, things that tempt us, you know? And not enough leaders, not enough people to point us in the right direction. So you end livin' a fast life, full of sin
