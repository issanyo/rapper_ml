[Intro]
Check check one two
Y'all starting to get use to hearing that? It's crazy how...man fuck it
I'm a let the song speak for it self, you'll see what I mean

[Verse 1]
When I peel off in the drop top two-door
Hope everybody got my Kudos
But that ain't what it take is it?
They know I can pay a visit in the latest
Then go pay for some bitches
But what that say about me?
I ain't so concerned with what they say about me
I been more concerned with the layouts surrounding me
And my family crib, they don't know what vanity is
And the insanity is, I'm tryin' to get they ass a glimpse
Of the lifestyle, we was a lil more broke than we had planned to be shit
Fresh ain't plan for these kids, now he got a boy and girl that I admire
But to tell you I was ready for mine, well that would make me a liar
And a thief, robbing you of sleep
In your cot whenever you slide on a beat
I advise you to creep
Silent, I'm like a mother and her only cub
Most of these local artist ain't never show me love

[Hook]
And now they tryin' to show me some
Ironic huh, ironic how they'll do ya
They start a conflict over nothing so they can sue ya
And then praise God for it, Hallelujah
Nowadays everybody tryin' to show me some
Ironic huh, motherfucking right
It's crazy how the tables a turn on ya overnight
They was hating me they whole life
Nowadays everybody tryin' to show me some

[Verse 2]
And I'm still with Keep Pushin'
Anybody outside the clique they can keep pushin'
I done seen them looking, disguise they envy and hate
With a lil Henny and grape shwisher, then take pictures
They try to help you at your end and be your place kicker
I place them inside of a box, break the lock then shake them
And drop bombs on the city where they came from
Hiroshima they new beamer and save none
Lately I been dropping this A-1
I could rap about some ray gun technology and then make one
My policy is to fake none, some rapper worries about they reputation so much they simulate one
Talk about they self in prestige, don't you hate them
We are just some people with different means make some
Dollars and shit, like a mother and her only cub
Most of these local deejays ain't never show me love

[Hook]
And now they tryin' to show me some
Ironic huh, ironic how they'll do ya
They start a conflict over nothing so they can sue ya
And then praise God for it, Hallelujah
Nowadays everybody tryin' to show me some
Ironic huh, motherfucking right
It's crazy how the tables a turn on ya overnight
They was hating me they whole life
Nowadays everybody tryin' to show me some

[Verse 3]
Semilac was the nickname been a mac been intact
Long overdue for some interaction
On a national level, I get to smashing on devils
And drop no cash on a bezel but you can see the shine
My mind is like a mirror you can see the blind
But they can't see your eyes, how do we bridge the gap
I don't come to try him, God are you a living fact
I'm here to let you be and I'm giving back
My community I hold them strong
Someone tried to separate all our unity but I'm holding on
This a soldier who is strong in his mission with no instances a long
Intermission like these rappers do, I'm in the studio day and night
Tryin' to pay the price for no fradulent ice
I got a bitch who like it, ain't never been with a women
But say for me she dikin', she never let me lick the icin'
Nowadays she always be tryin' to show me somethin'
Ironic how your life change with the piece of paper I can rip up
They translate a contract for money at the strip club
And think I do it just to get my dick sucked
The fuck is they talking about

[Outro]
You know it's fucking crazy how many motherfuckers that just ain't fuck with you before that try and show you some now
