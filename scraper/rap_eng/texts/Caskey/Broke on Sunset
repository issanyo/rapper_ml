[Verse]
I'd never be Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
Tryna beef with everybody on the internet, feelin' shameless
I'd rather be broke on Sunset
Than in a Hollywood hotel, bein' famous
And be somebody that I ain't
Man, I gotta flee from the dank, man, this whole rap shit fake
I'm tryna keep this shit authentic
But it's hard, it ain't turnin' out great
I'd never be Kanye, put my ego to the side
Let the work ethic be the only entree
I'm tryna do sold out shows, the game made me an outcast
Man, I'm feelin' like André, I keep it 3000
Faith of a man move mountains
I ain't propel out of public housin'
But I seen a whole lot of struggle
Cut me in half, I made double, cut me in half
I'd never undermine my achievements
Say peace to my demons and pull out my piece to police 'em
I gotta go beastin'
Last year I made strides, but I'm tryna be more than just decent
And free somebody
Have your damn fans say, "You really motivatin' me to be somebody"
So I can't sell out on the fuck shit
Y'all still lyin' to your own self, I don't trust shit
I been the same man from the jump
Y'all thought the plan been sunk
Because I had change in the sound
But I can still be profound
Y'all brains are the only thing shrunk
Man, I hustle like Nipsey, yeah
I was nine years old, still knew the half ounce one fifty
Y'all tell a bunch of fake ass drug deal stories
Tryna come off motherfuckin' risky
And that shit miss me, yeah
I ain't in a big band, but I rock out
All them fake shots gettin' blocked out
You the police, always motherfuckin' copped out
Babe Ruth, I'm pointin' at the back of the fence
I already know it's comin' when it popped out
You don't wanna get to work, ain't no clock out
You ain't Mayweather, this a motherfuckin' knock out
I'd never be —
I'd never turn to the police, I'd rather do thirty
You tellin' on your homeboys surely
That's hoe shit, I guess that's why your whole shit girly
And I ain't sip dirty
Y'all rap about lean too much
That slurred out bullshit cloudin' up the scene too much
I'm on a dirt bike, bein' too clutch, comin' through with a...

[Chorus]
Yeah, bitch, I gotta change shit, whoa
Can't rock out with all this fake shit, yeah
Y'all was on that pop shit, yeah
Talk shit, you don't pop shit, shit, shit
Man, I gotta change shit, hey
Can't rock out with all this fake shit, yeah
Y'all still on that pop shit, yeah
Talk shit, you don't pop shit, shit, shit

[Outro]
Over the millennia, the voice became so whole-pervasive that it took over people's sense of identity. Whereas, for a long time, probably, after the arriving of thinking, humans still had a sense of rootedness in being — the natural sense of rootedness in the depths of their being
