[Intro]
You know, love's a funny thing, you know what I'm sayin'?
Comes with its ups and downs, yeah

[Refrain]
I tried to let you go (I tried, I tried, I tried, I tri-ied, tried)
I tried to let you go, oh (I tried, I tried, I tried, I tri-ied)

[Chorus]
You make me feel some type of way, oh (oh), ayy (ayy)
You make me feel some type of way, oh, ayy

[Verse]
You make me feel some type of way, gray
I'm driftin' (driftin'), space (space)
I'm tastin' your lips like it's yesterday
I'm smokin' so much chronic, it could take my breath away ('way)
You wanna watch a trick? Watch me levitate
You give me one more shot, I promise I won't hesitate (oh no)
Yeah, promise I won't hesitate
I try to move 'round, this is somethin' you can't replicate (oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me feel some type of way (type of way)
You make me (type of way)
You make me (type of way, yeah)

[Chorus]
You make me feel some type of way, oh (oh), ayy (ayy)
You make me feel some type of way, oh, ayy, ayy
You make me feel some type of way, oh (oh), ayy (ayy)
You make me feel some type of way, oh, ayy, ayy

[Refrain]
I tried to let you go (I tried, I tried, I tried, I tri-ied)
I tried to let you go, oh (I tried, I tried, I tried, I tri-ied)
Wait, you make me feel some type of way
