[Chorus: Father Lucas & Caskey]
Pac-Man, Pac-Man on your bitch, yeah

[Verse 1: Father Lucas]
Pac-Man, hold up, wait a minute, I've been gettin' rich, man
Pussy nigga, you can't even do the dash (dash), man
Look at me, you know I'm runnin' like I'm Pac-Man (I'm Pac-Man)
And I'm touchin' so far that I go, I'm set, man
Run that sack, all these niggas run it back
Pussy nigga, you get clapped, if you touch me and my gang
Pussy nigga, you a lame, and you know what I got, Kurt Cobain
I'll blow your brains, all these niggas look at like I'm saint
Hold up, wait a minute, I am not a saint (saint)
I'm just Father Lucas and you know I really do it (alright!)
If you try me or my gang, I'll shoot at your medulla (medulla)
Pussy nigga, I'ma fry you up like you a fish (okay, okay, okay)
Underwater sleaze, I'm just feelin' breeze (breeze), one two three
Ball out like Ginobli, all these niggas ball like Kobe, whoa whoa

Yeah, you know I eat the pack, man, and I'm good at that

[Chorus: Father Lucas & Caskey]

Man, I'm all around the country 'cause I'm tryna get the sack, man
Pac-Man, whoa whoa, yeah
Pac-Man, whoa whoa

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Okay, I'll touch down in the city and I'm rockin' Fendi
If she tryna fuck me, it's got to be inside of the Bentley
I don't want no problems, you run up, I'm wilin', clutchin' semis
I can't cuff no bitch who just want me, cut my money plenty
And my bitch bad
And I talkin' 'bout her when I say your bitch ass
You've been hatin' for too long, gon' get your shit clapped
In the foreign, got so many horses, whiplash
To think I started this with nick' bags
Now I'm, Pac-Man with my bitch, yeah
And I'm packed up, I turn one to a six, yeah
Man, I don't leave out the house without my stick, yeah
And I'm ballin' like I point guard for the Knicks, yeah

[Chorus: Father Lucas & Caskey]
Pac-Man, Pac-Man on your bitch, yeah
Hold on, wait a minute, I've been gettin' rich, yeah
Hold on, wait a minute, I'ma eat that bitch, yeah
Pac-Man, whoa whoa
Okay, I'm 'bout to whip a pack, I feel like Pac-Man (alright)
Man, I'm all around the country 'cause I'm tryna get the sack, man
Pac-Man, whoa whoa, yeah
Pac-Man, whoa whoa, yeah
