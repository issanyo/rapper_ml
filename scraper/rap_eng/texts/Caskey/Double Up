[Hook 1: Caskey]
I got money on my mind, I need to double up
I been sippin' dirty Sprite up out the double cup
I got two bitches on me, they playing double dutch
Boy don't talk about my life if you ain't done enough
Sold two thousand pounds of kush before the sun was up
Man these rappers talking shit we finna run 'em up
I got money on my mind, I need to double up
I got money on my mind, I need to double up


[Verse 1: Caskey]
Ok, Sebastian hit my line
He got some work we finna eat
Someone got a script of Roxie's
Told me grab the Pistol Pete
Someone probably want my head for my relations in the streets
Can't deny it, just get higher and make sure you roll fifty deep
I was serving ecstasy from Gwalla, Me, Pablo, and Pimpin'
When Daquane hit my line we served that crack out Expeditions
I've been praying for a script
I done made Xanax my religion
I ain't proud of shit
Question every day the way I'm living
But my Pop was poppin' Oxycontin daily
That's addiction
When he left the house
Grab the shit I cooked from out the kitchen
When my sister served that eight-ball, I was around the corner
Listenin'
Been corrupted since a child
And momma wonder why I'm missing

[Bridge: Caskey]
I got money on my mind
I been sippin' DJ Screw
I live my life in double time
Don't play with my paper
You get caught up with that number nine
They say drugs is bad but I'm on drugs
And I feel fuckin' fine

[Hook 2: Caskey]
I got money on my mind, I need to double up
I been sippin' dirty Sprite up out the double cup
I got money on my mind, I need to double up
I been sippin' dirty Sprite up out the double cup

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Okay, I can't deny should have stayed the fuck up out the streets
But I'm on one like my daddy, swear I ain't slept in a week
When my sister O.D. I was only eight I couldn't speak
Took the powder out her pocket, snorted that shit then I geeked
Momma think I'm living different
She don't know that I'm the same
We got Xanax, we got Percocets
We got shit for the pain
I just fucked the bitch inside the house
Ain't know she was a freak
She ain't tell me she a squirter
I'm hyped every time she leak
On the stove
Pimpin' showed me you could microwave the dope
My lil' homie stabbed somebody, he got counts of debt to grow
Daniel caught a body, heard he 'bout to go to jail for life
That's my partner
We popped Xanax bars, he'd teach me how to fight
Use to pull up at his house and sip the Jack D on the bike
Now I'm pulling up with Birdman, pouring codeine in the Sprite
Hit the plug up from my sister's phone and asked him about the price
And ever since that day I'm out here living right
Fuckin' right

[Bridge: Caskey]
I got money on my mind
I been sippin' DJ Screw
I live my life in double time
Don't play with my paper
You get caught up with that number nine
They say drugs is bad but I'm on drugs
And I feel fuckin' fine

[Hook 2: Caskey]
I got money on my mind, I need to double up
I been sippin' dirty Sprite up out the double cup
I got money on my mind, I need to double up
I been sippin' dirty Sprite up out the double cup

[Verse 3: Woop]
I been sippin' dirty Sprite, I got the double up
Muddy tint poured in my double cup
I just pulled a Bermuda Burlington
He don't even see it coming when it's about to hit him
I don't always be on time cause I be kinda busy
I be swinging gas through the whole city
Twerking, double cupping, flowing all night long
I don't know who's louder, this hoe or my phone
I wake up with hoes, I got my double cup
This is how you make it when you're out of work
Shake and bake, Pass off Curry
Made the call, ain't no deal at all, stick 'em up
Double cup or double cuff
Double cup if you stay with me I might live
Double cup or double cuff
Double cup I want you right here by my side

[Hook 2: Caskey]
I got money on my mind, I need to double up
I been sippin' dirty Sprite up out the double cup
I got money on my mind, I need to double up
I been sippin' dirty Sprite up out the double cup
