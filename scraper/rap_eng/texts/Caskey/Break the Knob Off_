[Verse 1]
We gon' break the knob off
Two bad bitches in the cut with me, I'm movin' like a mob boss
Draped in hot sauce
Y'all gon' talk that tough talk 'til it pop off
Drippin' on, shit triflin'
In the 'rari with no license
Let me in [?] swing, Mike Tyson
[?] gon' bite shit
We gon' break the knob off
Two bad bitches in the cut with me, I'm movin' like a mob boss
Fuck y'all broke, we get paid to drop off
Take ass, we ain't gotta stay, we not soft
Just came back from the bluff
Might have to go cop me a brick off of Ralo
Maybe not though, the chain so big
When I step outside, still these hoes gon' follow
Break the knob off
Y'all been so damn poppin' that your homeboys [?] fall off
That relationship you got to call off
All that hatin' shit gon' get the ball off
Where the money at?
Y'all just wanna wallow in the bullshit and man ain't feelin' that
I pull up to your spot with a hunnid racks (whoa)
And I run it like a runnin' back

[Chorus]
We gon' break the knob off
Two bad bitches in the cut with me, I'm movin' like a mob boss
Draped in hot sauce
Y'all gon' talk that tough talk 'til it pop off
Pussy, uh
In this shit, gon' pop off

[Verse 2]
Cut me the check
There ain't no need to check me, my main bitch is sexy
I whip out the lot in a Lexi, I'm ballin', I should won an Espy
With all due respect, they address me
I told that lil bitch not to text me, dog
We not from H-Town
But I go Lil Flip on a bitch who try bringin' a snake 'round
I grew up, turned the bank to my playground
Turn the meetin' to a shakedown
We gon' break the knob off
Just signed two million dollars worth of deals, I ain't takin' time off
You is in the back, but you ain't ridin'
Left the clique and went down a spiral
Strange like a TEC-9
Yeah, I do all the checkin' here, check mine
I am pullin' up [?] jetline
Tryna hit another city, make the set time

[Chorus]
'cause we gon' break the knob off
Two bad bitches in the cut with me, I'm movin' like a mob boss
Draped in hot sauce
Y'all gon' talk that tough talk 'til it pop off
Break the knob off
Ye ain't wanna be cool back then, don't change the dialogue
This shit could pop off

[Verse 3]
You lil pussies ain't gettin' no dollars, don't talk about mine
Say they in the [?] did the outline
I ain't gotta throw shade, all I do is outshine
What a motherfucker gonna say about mine?
Y'all gon' hate from a distance
I got this damn far off of work and persistence
Don't call me yo' bud in this business
I'ma pull up money like incense
Break the knob off, woo
Y'all got somethin' to say, then say it
Yeah, I can't stand a motherfucker
Tryna be on that fake shit (pussy)
Y'all in the same damn spot
And you're bein' complacent
I've been all 'round the world
Tryna get to the check 'cause you gotta go chase it

[Chorus]
Break the knob off
Two bad bitches in the cut with me, I'm movin' like a mob boss
Draped in hot sauce
Y'all gon' talk that tough talk 'til it pop off
Whoa
Ye ain't wanna be cool back then, don't change the dialogue
Break the knob off
Break the knob off

[Outro]
Bitch
We gon' break the knob off
Break the knob off, whoa
We gon' break the knob off, whoa
We gon' break the knob off
