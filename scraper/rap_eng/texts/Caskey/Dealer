[Chorus: Nicolina]
She gon' hold you up, but I'ma hold you down
She might let you touch, but I'ma go for rounds
I'ma always be there when you need that
I can be your dealer when you need that
She gon' hold you up, but I'ma hold you down
She might let you touch, but I can go for rounds
I'ma always be there when you need that
I can be your dealer when you need that

[Verse 1: Izzy The Type]
She said she could hold me up, but I'ma hold her down
We been smoking dope, girl, pass that shit around
Yeah, she'll let me touch, but you can go for rounds
I just had to stop, get up to blow it down

[Verse 2: Nicolina]
Baby, you can call me when you need that
How I got you moaning, that's the feedback
Put your hands behind your head then relax
Know my loving is a drug, I'll make you relapse
She gon' hold you up, but I'ma hold you down
If she hit your phone again, I might let off some rounds
Know I keep the Draco if I need that
It's stashed up in the trunk, I wanna see that

[Chorus: Nicolina]
She gon' hold you up, but I'ma hold you down
She might let you touch, but I'ma go for rounds
I'ma always be there when you need that
I can be your dealer when you need that
She gon' hold you up, but I'ma hold you down
She might let you touch, but I can go for rounds
I'ma always be there when you need that
I can be your dealer when you need that

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Shorty got that shit I really like, is you the plug?
My bitch, she so bad she don't wan' fuck 'round with them scrubs
Turn up every weekend, ain't gon' fall off in the club
She gon' get this D and think I'm known for serving drugs
And she wanna come fuck with a pimp, who am I to deny it?
We keep on getting higher, she the opposite of quiet
Told her to talk to me crazy, she said my tongue feeling so amazin'
I told her, "Cum for me baby, then get behind and do a 180"
Then get inside and do something different, what's the problem with commitment?
I could eat up, eat up every Friday, even Sunday I'm with the business
I give ya plenty of inches, I get the package then I fuck with ya
I told my ex bitch not to call no mo', my new girl a drug dealer

[Chorus: Nicolina]
She gon' hold you up, but I'ma hold you down
She might let you touch, but I'ma go for rounds
I'ma always be there when you need that
I can be your dealer when you need that
She gon' hold you up, but I'ma hold you down
She might let you touch, but I can go for rounds
I'ma always be there when you need that
I can be your dealer when you need that

[Outro: Nicolina]
She gon' hold you up, I'ma, I'ma hold you down
She might, she might let you touch, but I'ma go for rounds, rounds
I'ma always be there when you need that
I can be your dealer when you need that
She gon' hold you up, I'ma, I'ma hold you down
She might let you touch, but I can go for rounds
I'ma, I'ma always be there when you need that
I can, I can be your dealer when you need that
