[Hook: Caskey]
I'm always on a pill
I'm always smoking kush up out the seal
I'm always with some hoes who trying to chill
I'm always on a pill
I;m always high for real
Always with my dogs who got the steel
Always at the spot and coppin' something i can deal
I'm always with some hoes i'm finna kill
She always on the pill
I'm always high for real
We so high we ain't never get low
When the drugs gone you know we get mo'
I'm always high for real
Always, Always, Always, Always

[ClicKlak]
I'm always gonna be about the dollar
Just ask my big brother Gwalla
Pimpin' these hoes with no problem
My trap be booming and bumping
My door is swinging with junkies
And i'm a three time felon
Who just got off probation
No choices so how could you judge me
I took me some ecstasy at the strip club
And i tried to come down off a Xanny bar
My heart was beating, it was racing
I wasn't really sure if i would see tomorrow
She screaming, "Como te amo!"
My belt Ferragamo
Look like Rihanna
She draped in designer
You think there's a bitch finer, then fine her
This a reminder don't let them hoes blind ya
I whip my diamonds, invisible sets
And i shine with my blood, let me throw up my set
I designer my drugs, i be boomin' with thugs
I always stay high like i can't get enough
Watch a nigga levitate
I've been smoking Lemon D
I been grinding everyday
Switching hoes on all in one day
Sippin' lean i love the taste
Couple blunts to the face
Fuck what you're going through
Take you some drugs, bet all the pain go away

[Hook]

[Caskey]
Bitch better have my money
I'm coming with Stunna
You owe us a hundred, so keep it one hundred
Here with my partners, you know they my gunners
I love all my day ones, the ones that i run with
Shout out my am'bition she left me with nothing
In-motivated, i'm locked in the dungeon
Off so much lean, i can't even function
We all on a mission
We all in the kitchen
We got it, it's all in fruition
The ballin' edition
I knew we would make, i swear it was all intuition
These rappers are faker than fucks
We come to party, we come with the style
Got me a check
And done got me a'rrested
Ain't no one fucking with the kid for awhile
I mean started, set, go
With the film gettin' net
Make your bitch wet
Fuck her on a Canon disk set
Twenty times i could go
She gon' tell you what she can get
I gon' bust it, leave the country
Put that gold around my neck
Put that dope inside the pot
Whip the dope until it lock
I'm gonna call my homie [?], tell 'em we gon' flood the block
We been pushin' it, gettin' hot
We the ones you gotta watch
They pull us over, i'ma tell her to put it in her crotch

[Hook]
