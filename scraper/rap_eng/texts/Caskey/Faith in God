[Chorus]
Put your faith in God, then go make it happen
Pray to him, just follow that with action
Shootin' stars don't do shit without the passion, ayy
Go and get that shit yourself, law of attraction

[Verse]
I've been stackin' up my chips
Lil wodie, don't you play on my time
Y'all on the sideline
I'm gon' get rich or die tryin'
All of my bitches, they wine fine
I looked at my Vans, I'm thinkin', "It's grind time"
The end of a era like nine-nine
They see the truth in my words 'cause they mind blind
Diamonds on my neck look butterfly, ayy
Pop up out the, cocoon, I'm on stutter time
Told her, "We got to fuck another time" (I'm sorry, baby)
Can't be complacent 'til I make my momma shine
And I got a fetish for writin' poetry inside of a foreign front seat
I got a freak who tryna untangle all of my life's work in one week
I'm Bun B, without Pimp C
My best friend tried to tempt me
Used to pimp down hoes in the Bentley
I used to look at the stacks with a envy
Now I'm best friends with the Benji, ayy
When you put all of your focus inside of the music
Don't think 'bout Mackenzie (Sorry)
And give all the love to your fans
Don't think 'bout the industry, that shit a frenzy, ayy
I'm one the best of the century
They tried to break me, but they couldn't bend me, ayy
Now I'm inside of the game
And ain't fuckin' her gently, ayy, whoa

[Bridge]
This life ain't real, fuck how they feel
Turn up on 'em, drink water, don't pay your bills
This life ain't real, fuck how they feel
Be yourself, do what you love, go get the mills

[Chorus]
Put your faith in God, then go make it happen
Shootin' stars ain't gon' do shit without action, ayy
Pray to him, just follow that with passion, ayy
Go and get that shit yourself, law of attraction, ayy

[Bridge]
This life ain't real, fuck how they feel
Turn up on 'em, drink water, don't pay your bills, ayy
This life ain't real, fuck how they feel
Be yourself, what you love gon' get the mills, ayy
