[Intro]
Float away, mhm
Float away
Float away, mhm
Float away

[Chorus]
Ooh, float away
Ooh, just float away
Ooh, float away
Yeah, all I seem to think about is tryna float away

[Verse 1]
I don't know what's going on today
Look around and I do not relate
Know myself, so it's not for debate
Tried to keep it real, but it's so fake
Out in LA, everybody snakes
Bitches only want ya for the cake
Friends only there when it's great
Just be careful you don't lose your place
It's a dirty world, say your grace
Out here saying prayers everyday from outer space
'cause being home just don't feel like something to embrace
And all I seem to think about is tryna float away

[Chorus]
Ooh, just float away
Ooh, just float away
Ooh, just float away
All I seem to think about is tryna float away (skrt)

[Verse 2]
I can't get the love without the hate
Everytime I post a picture up, there's something to debate
So many people don't even know 'bout me, just what is on display
How I came from moving plates?
Or how my pop wasn't there to play?
How I turn one to a tre?
How I did this by myself? Ain't had to make no powder play, hey
That was my big sister hustle, she was moving weight, hey
That's why when you talking tough, I feel some type of way, hey
All that shit so lame
Y'all don't act gangsta to me, make a hunnid million all legit
Pull your family out the sticks & buy some new shit you could whip
Put your partners on, make sure everybody got a crib
And until that day I hit that, boy, I guess I ain't got time to float away

[Chorus]
Ooh, just float away
Ooh, just float away
Ooh, just float away
Everytime I think about it, I just float away
