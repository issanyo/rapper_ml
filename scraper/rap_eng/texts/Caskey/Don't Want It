[Verse 1]
Ya ok what goes 'round come back 'round
I ain't worry about y'all career
Nah y'all career in the background
And i'm front and center
All of my competition is summed up in one contender
I look him in the mirror every time that i go out
Count money by the lab in the grow house
Put my name on the show and it's sold out
I'm cuttin' y'all suckin'
Die slow, spend somethin'
I go in huntin' on the highway
And I'm sittin' side ways
I ain't no compadre
Mother fucka' i sell pills in the lobby
Lookin' like i want some problems
Y'all do credit card and business scams
I done sold like a million grams
I'm coolin' like the ceilin' fans
Check the status and i'm still the man
Who the greatest?
Sometime it get misconstrued into who the latest
Or who the radio gone play more
Or who got the budget that will pay more
Or who name flash on the t.v. screen
Y'all hoes get lost in the hype
I will stray straight from the mainstream bullshit
Cool shit dog but it's so your type
Mother fuckers don't want it
Somethin' gotta give
I outdo all these rappers still it don't amount to shit
They takin' shots at me must have a gun without a clip
Cause i ain't seen no damage done
And i'm just oh so 'bout this shit
Now they don't want it, they don't want
I come through with semi-autos
Kill all my opponents
They don't want it, they don't want it
Show up in my Jason mask
And kill all of my opponents
They don't want it
