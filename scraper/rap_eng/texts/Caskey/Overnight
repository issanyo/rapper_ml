[Intro]
Two steps ahead of the game
(The Avengers)
Pussy, yeah
Man, I've been two steps ahead of the game
For a little while now, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Learn a thing or two

[Verse 1]
Ayo, this job takes some late nights, stuck in seclusion
Suffering delusion, I'm stuck inside of the music
They confused by my real estate
They wanna see me induced, buying real estate
Tryin' to make a million late, 2013, or sooner
My grind overtime and I'm meditating with users
And addicts and tryin' to produce the magic
You like to stand with your hand out
I don't owe you one, maggot
You probably sit there in your spare time
Tweeting celebrities, ignoring destiny
All that Tabasco and couldn't spice up your recipe
Starting line couldn't get the best of me

[Hook 1]
You could say it's over, right?
This ain't happen overnight
Nah, yeah, I'm two steps ahead of the game
Shit this ain't come overnight man
This been a long time coming
(2 steps ahead of the game)
Ya'll was at home tweeting celebrities and shit
Waiting for a handout
(2 steps ahead of the game)

[Verse 2]
Fuck 'em, bow, rollin' through my city with the trunk, whilin'
In the cut with the funk but I'm done hidin'
Needed time for reflection
The moon never shine right when it's crescent
My adolescence was stressful
And only in preparation for this, education persists
But I ain't going to college, homie, I'm taking these trips
'round the globe, I ain't pissed 'bout a O
That ya owe me from that one time befo'
I'll give you that and some mo'
See me, I'm hitting Egypt fo' sho
Coppin' shit that you be leasin' fo' sho
I swear you got that type of fire that depletin' the snow
Placing seeds inside the ground, praise to Jesus they grow
I got no reason to show
Love to these local artists who ain't buy a feature
When I ain't have money to buy some reefer
But yo, it's cool, I sleep with one eye open
Next time I meet ya

[Hook 2]
You could say it's over, right?
This ain't happen overnight
Nah, hah, been working hard for a minute
(2 steps ahead of the game)
Shit, ya'll don't know what overtime grind is, I swear, dog
(2 steps ahead of the game)
Ya'll going 60, I'm going 100 in this motherfucker
(2 steps ahead of the game)
Flying past the competition, man
They still wish I fell off, fuck 'em

[Verse 3]
Man, I'm just sitting here, reading Leviticus
Preaching to the wrong choir, man, somebody come witness this
These records are hit or miss, I swear I hit the booth like Babe Ruth
Tryin' to cop my momma a coupe with a suede roof
A hundred thousand different type of guns, the same juice
A thousand books that worship the sun, still the same truth
Or this is that truth in the sequel
I ain't one of these deceitful ass rappers who lyin'
I'm just tryin' to show love to my people, everything equal
