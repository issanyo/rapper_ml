[Verse 1: Nate Millyunz]
Yeah, who got the sauce?
Cop a new coupe, knock the roof off the top
Boy, I really put the juke in the box
Let's put in that work, then we'll see who gon' cop
Truly unstoppable, do the impossible
Watch how they watching us move through these obstacles
You tryna see me? Get you some new opticals
Bringing the bliss then I call then I'm calling the [?]
Don't compare the kid to nobody
I'm the one they jock and they copy
Li fi, I know the squad got me
'cause my God, I'll ride for my posse
Dip, see vacation, the fruits of my labors
Might book us a flight, take the crew out to Vegas
I just wanna live 'fore they send me to Heaven
I'm breaking bread with Cash Money Records, like

[Hook: Nate Millyunz]
I hold it down for the fam, dog
Never stand down in a stand off

Never stand down in a stand off

Swear I'll die for my brothers, yeah

[Verse 2: Phoreiign]
Still moving in forces
Big poles in them Porsches
Pussy start with that digiy dash
And I educate just like horses
I'm just tryna ball like Borus
Keep that heat packed just like storage
I'll ride for my brothers
Why you think it's all in that chorus?
I 187 the cheddar, fly as propellers
I get that head [?]
Ducking the D's and vendettas, these niggas is jealous
That's why I hold more than berettas
They hate that I'm caught in this lettuce
And these three bitches won't let us
My niggas never gon' let up
Ride for my brothers forever, yeah

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Okay, I, hey, never stand down in a stand off
I, ride for my brothers, hands off
I'm solid, you a cupcake and your man soft
You probably enter in the dance offs
You don't want it with the outlaws
Got a goddess waiting at the crib
Dancin' with her pants off
I ride for my homies, Gandalf
Gotta run it up and run it 'round the city like a handoff
And I tell my dogs
Then I fade away into the background
Stepping up, you better step down
I'll black out 'fore I ever, ever, ever back down for my dogs

[Hook: Nate Millyunz]
I hold it down for the fam, dog
Never stand down in a stand off
I'll ride for my brothers, yeah
Swear I'll die for my brothers, yeah
I hold it down for the fam, dog
Never stand down in a stand off

Swear I'll die for my brothers, yeah
