[Verse 1]
Before you hate on me, wait and see
I've been plotting so long I done brought this thang with me
People change up on me, that's the shit I hate to see
Know what come with fame ‘cause Baby gave the game to me
Heard you popping in the O, I went to Vain to see
Ain't no hoes up in your section, that's what strange to me
Just might buy some bottles for ya, ain't a thang to me
Know you gon' fuck a couple bad ones if you hang with me
Wise, could tell that you ain't 'bout a thing when I look in your eyes
I got so much respect for self that I don't speak the lies
I roll around the country with my partners on my side
‘Cause Baby told me hold it down for those that down to ride
Wait to see, the game in need
I come to save it, I got everything from A to Z
I'm well aware there's only rappers just afraid of me
You trying to join the winning team, it's best to stay with me

[Hook]
Staywitme, staywitme
Rappers know what time it is, they ain't gon' play with me
All the hoes that trying to holler used to skate on me
Got advice for anybody trying to hate on me
Staywitme, staywitme
Got two bitches on the line that's trying to play with me
I'm 'round the world, I'm doing everything they hate to see
I'm with my day ones, they the only ones that stay with me

[Verse 2]
Chain on me, faithfully
People said they'd hold me down, went David Blaine on me
If I gave a fuck about 'em it'd be shame on me
If I wasn't shining they wouldn't throw no shade on me
C'est la vie, c'est la vie
Don't need nobody else opinion 'bout the way I be
Know some hoes that stalking every club I say I be
Got locked up in thirty third, just know today I'm free
We came to feast, we bang the piece
Y'all been riding 'round in foreigns but that thing is leased
I'm a monster, I'm a problem, they can't tame the beast
I can't fuck with none of these rappers, that's to say the least
Play for keeps, I barely fucked in weeks
Most these bitches ain't got shit for me, I came up off of beats
Got me focused on the cause, got me court side with the seats
Know I took a couple losses, just know my hunger increased

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know I got it
This shit isn't just a hobby
This isn't rapping, this is catching bodies
This the type of hunger make this shit excitin'
This is uninvitin', this get you indicted
This the type of shit that ain't no one providin'
These the flows I come up with when I get thrivin'
Just imagine how many I got inside me
No one better eye me, no one better try me
I come out of body, y'all just know karate
I got double shotties, hitting up the lobby
No one left beside me, shoot up everybody
They cannot deny me, they know where to find me
This why Baby signed me, this the perfect timin'
This is an alignment, this is why I'm grindin'
This the verse that make you reconsider rhymin'
It's better to staywitme

[Hook]
