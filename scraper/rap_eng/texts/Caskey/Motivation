[Verse 1]
Harley boy, skrrt on 'em, yeah, damn
He done came a long way from just pitching grams
Shout out all my fans, working through the dirt all on my hands
They once told me, "Boy, I got some pressing plans"
I got no time for beef, especially when we destined for defeat
I'm a king, y'all is barely at my feet
I got no time to weep, I been at this shit here 800 weeks
Most of them nights, I ain't even go to sleep
People hated on me from the start, fuck I did?
Froze both my wrists and froze my heart, fuck this shit
All of that adversity done turned me to a man
I look inside the mirror and I know just who I am
Y'all's is still in question, I done grew from all of that rejection
Yeah, it turned me to a person well respected
I did what expected, matter of fact I did more than projected
'Cause I don't put all them hours tryna finesse it

[Hook]
This is motivation, standing in the spot, cultivatin'
I'm the hottest shit now in circulation
This is motivation, fuck all of that petty shit, you hatin'
Out here, there ain't no time for us to waste it
This is motivation, this is blood, sweat, determination
This is 10,000 hours in the makin'
This is motivation, yeah
This is motivation, yeah, ay

[Verse 2]
This right here is gospel, this is where I work and plenty pot smoke
You're still on that color bitch and thot flow
People say I got dough, thinking summer's over 'cause my watch froze
And be everything that they is not, though
Y'all just thinking backwards, damn, you should be happy that I'm not broke
In the kitchen, lettuce and cilantro, Magic City, God flow
Tell them strippers, "Bust it open, pronto"
Federalis drop in on my convo, Harley boy, skrrt on 'em
Y'all is really with the hurt, Harley boy, skrrt on 'em
Don't you know we pulling licks of work?

[Hook]
Ay, this is motivation, standing in the spot, cultivatin'
I'm the hottest shit now in circulation
This is motivation, this is hard work, determination
This is 10,000 hours in the makin'
This is motivation, yeah, whoa, hey, hey, ay
This is motivation, yeah, yeah, damn
