[Chorus: Caskey]
Fuck goin' broke
This money out here for the takin'
And if I can't get it myself
I gotta go take it, yeah
I got a G in my pocket
Ain't talkin' Freemason
I tried to wait for it, I had to go and get it
Baby, I'm too impatient
Fuck goin' broke
This money out here for the takin' (gotta take it)
And if I can't get it myself
I gotta go take it (I gotta take it)
See, I got a G in my pocket
Ain't talkin' Freemason
I tried to wait for it, I had to go and get it
Baby, I'm too impatient

[Verse 1: Caskey]
New formulation
I gotta serve up the city, got weight like the station
I can't explain shit
You tryna talk on the phone, that's miscommunication
I'm too impatient
When you try wait for somebody, that's time that you wastin'
Ain't give 'em too much information
Fuck all that stupid shit, I'm goin' ape shit
Fuck all that cupid shit, I gotta make shit
Ain't goin' on dates, I'm tryna formulate
And whip up a whole lot of cake
It's not for a weddin' or somethin' you bakin'
I got a hustle that's undeniable
They wanna work 'cause I'm viable
I ride around, bumpin' a whole lot of Nas
It Was Written like my mafuckin' Bible
I hit a lick on my mafuckin' rival
Only thing I want, survival
Said that you love me, they hate on me
Problem with people like you, you can't decide who you ride for
You switchin' up about a dollar
You clique hoppin' for some clout shit
You talkin' shit but you ain't 'bout shit
Yeah, I'm just better off without ya

[Chorus: Caskey]
Fuck goin' broke
This money out here for the takin', yeah
And if I can't get it myself
I gotta go take it
I got a G on me
I ain't even talkin' Freemason
I had to wait for it, I had to go and get it
Baby, I'm too impatient, yeah
Fuck goin' broke
The money out here for the takin'
And if I can't get it myself
I gotta go take it, yeah
I got a G on me, dog
I ain't talkin' Freemason, yeah
I tried to wait for it, I had to get it
Impatient

[Verse 2: Zach Boss]
Said I had to get it, impatient
Nah, I'm never workin' the dayshift
I ride around in that spaceship
See, I roll a G, then I face it
But I never really did it like that
Said I got a good bitch and she bring it right back
Got a couple hunnid stacks, I don't need any packs
All my girl need is that, yeah
Said I'm feedin' her dick and she hit like crack
Yeah, she gon' bring it right back for a real one
Like his stick clack, then I peel one (pow)
Whole lot of drugs in the buildin' (now)
Got a whole lot of whips, I ain't steal one (wow, yeah)
Let me kill it for a minute, said I'm in it to win it
Push your shit to the limit, I ain't kiddin' (nah)
But I'm ridin' in the whip and the windows tinted
See my day one [?]
Know you talkin' shit, but I ain't offended
'cause all that shit roll downhill, pussy
