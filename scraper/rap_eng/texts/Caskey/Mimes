[Verse 1: Komplex]
This is the intro music
Mama should've locked me in an institution for inducin' such a sick conclusion
I stick and move and hit the roof when I get to groovin'
Big improvement with the moves and now I got these bitches choosin'
Kids consume and listen to my tunes, they system boomin'
Simply human, did some shrooms, got me feeling lucid
You still look stupid if you hating on the illest doin' this
Skilled to prove it, feel the fluid, when I'm spittin' to it
I feel like '97 Em
Right around the time that Dre discovered him
I'm grimy with the pen, a lion in his den
I'm a giant amongst men, start a riot from within
Bitch, I'm monstrous, internal conflict is the consequence
Of constant clouded consciousness that clogged up all my common sense
No common 'plex, my confidence ain't cockiness
My awesomeness is obvious, I stand out in an audience

[Hook: Komplex]
So tell the crowd make a cloud while I break it down
Ain't the sidekick, meanwhile, videos gon' make me viral
A great empire I aspire to create in time
Working with creative minds, mimes imitate our lines

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Okay, dilated pupils in the heart of the lion's den
Playing my violin, out here slaying leviathans
Mask on my face and that ain't for hidin' in
We just come to cop both the keys to the car you ridin' in
I snatch your girl too, she wetter than what Poseidon in
She love my shit, that's 'cause there ain't a verse that I'm lyin' in
Some rappers overindulge in they lyrics, lost in appearance
What they bring in wit, they lack in spirit
At your concert, filled in the blanks to your punchlines
Like a crossword, they was predictable as these bitches
When we converse, I slap a hoe with the mossberg
Cough syrup, slowing me down like it's Mr. Officer
Intellect prevail when the skeptics sail
Your respect is frail, when your homies say that they collectin' bail
But you sitting there rottin', we been picking cotton
Slaving for the dollar signs like freedom ain't a option, yeah

[Hook: Komplex]
So tell the crowd make a cloud while I break it down
Ain't the sidekick, meanwhile, videos gon' make me viral
A great empire I aspire to create in time
Working with creative minds, mimes imitate our lines

[Verse 3: Teejay Rodgers]
[?] 83 at the embassy
Bomb in my backpack, I'm hunting for the enemy
Level headed, I'm level at everything ahead of me
Especially gon' show these mafuckers not to mess with me
Mentally, this shit could take a toll on you, drugs got a hold on you
Friends ain't loyal, switch up and fold on you
Bold move, you chicken like soul food
I'm gettin' and stickin' and movin', bitches choosin', want me to roll through
A cold brew with doobies usually what I hold
Truth be told, this music shit has me, something like a mold to me
I fit like play-doh, Socrates is my old head
And my philosophy is obviously getting old bread
Stacking that mold, I'm back in that mode
Give me an instrumental, I feel like I'm cooking crack on that stove
Notepad is my crack sack, keep it in my backpack
Next to the scale, weed mail, flipping it like a flapjack

[Hook: Komplex]
So tell the crowd make a cloud while I break it down
Ain't the sidekick, meanwhile, videos gon' make me viral
A great empire I aspire to create in time
Working with creative minds, mimes imitate our lines
