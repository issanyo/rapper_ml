[Verse 1: Dre Fresh]
I get the pistol popping like it's acne
My money adding up, yours subtractin'
My nigga making movie, we ain't rappin'
Based on a true story, we ain't actin' (Hey, hey!)
I am not [?]
I got that shit that'll fuck up your nose
I'm talking that green and I'm talking that blow
Either way, you can get it for low
Pull up on the shop, we plot [?]
[?] you know, let it blow
Disrespectful, turn a nun to a hoe
All that I fuck, putting dick in her throat
Niggas hating, but they know we on
Come get your bitch, she ain't going home
Said she love the music and I'm her love
Want a nigga to fuck her to all her songs

[Bridge: Caskey]
Go team
Yeah, ay, go team, ay
Yeah, I'ma catch 'em when I see 'em, ay
Yeah, I'ma probably fuck a BM, what we doing?

[Hook: Caskey]

Trap or die, ay, the whole season, ay
OTin', bitch Korean, ay
Fuck my BM, ay, in the BM, ay

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Serve the block, ay, I'm the GM, ay
Work the stock, ay, quarter kiin', ay
Sixty seconds, ay, and I'm speedin', ay
Hold on, hold on, wait, wait
Too much hi-tech leanin', yeah, I'm beamin'
Eighteen hunnid, I spend that, she suck my semen
Might just pull up with that blam, pop a Xan' and kill my demons
Told her there no intervenin', rup up a check, we all tryna scheme it
Throwing up gang signs like bulimics, washing that dirty money in the cleaners
Overtime, we work overtime, ay
Overtime, yeah, we work overtime
Pull up on them jiggas, we don't do no sober time, ay
'migo roll for mine, ay, we work overtime, ay

[Hook: Caskey]

Bitch Korean, ay, I'm in a BM, ay
