... we gon' pull that chopper, turn away, yeah, ay
She gon' come and suck my dick at least 'cause that's that life yeah
They get on the Molly, all girls turn to dykes, yeah
You been in your feelings, ain't know that's your wife, yeah
She was skating but she come 'round for the price, yeah

... my diamonds cabbage, just touched down in Paris
And my jewelry shining, your shit so embarrassed

... we gon' do this every night, that's that life
I done popped a couple pills, I'm sipping Sprite
I got me like thirty straps, we finna fight
I got me some freaky bitches, they love to dyke
We gon' do this every night, that's that life

... keep the 30 when I sleep
I'll be 29 with 30 million at least, yeah, whoa
I'll be 29 with 30 million at least, whoa
She didn't sign the form but that shit is leased
Yeah, when I talk they be telling me, "preach"

... ain't no use in tryna cope
Teach me, all my diamonds Geechi
All these girls I meet in LA out here, turning freaky
I'm inside the club with no security, they can't sneak me
The whole bank know me by name, we make deposits weekly
Few or more, we doing less, diamonds pass the test
Told that stripper, "Come 'round, get that big booty caressed"
We done kept it south and east and now we out in west
Got no time to rest, get money, invest
We gon' do this shit here every night
