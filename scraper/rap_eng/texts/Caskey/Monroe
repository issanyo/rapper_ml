[Intro: Tyla Yaweh]
She is a bad one, Marilyn Monroe, yeah

[Hook: Tyla Yaweh]
She is a bad one, Marilyn Monroe
She likes to roll, pop one then go
She feels no sorrow, her feelings gone
She's on the run, she's on the run
She is a bad one, Marilyn Monroe
Pop one then go, she's on a roll
She feels no sorrow, her feelings gone
She's on the run, she's on the run

[Verse: Caskey]
My bitch so choosey
Bad ass bih and she bump Lil Boosie
I'm ducked off, high, eating sushi
Got the Rollie on the wrist, feeling boujee, whoa
My bitch, she dress in the new Chanel
She hot and she feeling herself, can't you tell?
Okay, I'm hot and I'm feeling myself
Only thing that I hang 'round; wealth
In a black Rolls Royce, in stealth
Told her, "Gotta play the cards you dealt"
My bitch, she a lover, my bitch, she a lover
And we high on the pill, drinking muddy
In the cut and we serving Kid Cudi
Told her, "Break off a slab for the buddy"

[Hook: Tyla Yaweh]
She is a bad one, Marilyn Monroe
She likes to roll, pop one then go
She feels no sorrow, her feelings gone
She's on the run, she's on the run
She is a bad one, Marilyn Monroe
Pop one then go, she's on a roll
She feels no sorrow, her feelings gone
She's on the run, she's on the run

[Bridge: Tyla Yaweh]
Her heart is cold, she stole my soul
Her heart is cold, she stole my soul
Her heart is cold, she stole my soul
Her heart is cold, she stole my soul
Aw, aw, aw, aw, aw
She stole my soul
Aw, aw, aw, aw, aw
Her heart is cold

[Hook: Tyla Yaweh]
She is a bad one, Marilyn Monroe
She likes to roll, pop one then go
She feels no sorrow, her feelings gone
She's on the run, she's on the run
She is a bad one, Marilyn Monroe
Pop one then go, she's on a roll
She feels no sorrow, her feelings gone
She's on the run, she's on the run
