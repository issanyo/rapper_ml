[Verse 1]
I got some time and it's goin' to waste
'peal got declined and that's always the case
Read through the lines, see that I'm not okay
Not okay-ay

[Verse 2]
I got some time and it's goin' to waste
When I was nine, saw too much for my age
They say I'll be fine, but I'd be lyin' if I said
I'm okay-ay-ay

[Chorus]
She likes to tell me what to do, and I don't like that
All I wanna do, spend the night back
Hollerin' at the moon, 'cause it ain't like that
Locked inside this room, I just wanna see the outside
Wanna see the outside

[Verse 3]
I got some time and it's goin' to waste
Caught me with nines, said that I wasn't safe
But I was just tryin' to put a little food
On the pla-a-ate

[Verse 4]
I got some time and it's goin' to waste
When I'll decline is gettin' harder to trace
I lost my mind somewhere
Inside this pla-a-ace

[Chorus]
They like to tell me what to do, and I don't like that
All I wanna do, is spend the night back
Hollerin' at the moon, 'cause it ain't like that
Locked inside this room, I just wanna see the outside (outside)
Just wanna see the outside (outside)
Wanna see the outside
I just wanna see the outside
