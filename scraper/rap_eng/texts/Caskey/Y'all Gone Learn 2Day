[Intro]
You need to know who you fuckin' with
And considering you don't know who the fuck I am
I guess you about to find out
More importantly, we're gonna find out who the fuck you are
You don't fuck with the family members

[Bridge]
Don't be flexin' like you is the plug
I'm on Molly and a lot of drugs
I'm in the studio, I don't do clubs
Seen the clique you rockin' with, y'all a bunch of scrubs

[Hook 1]
Y'all gon' learn today, y'all gon' learn
Y'all gon' learn today, y'all gon' learn
Y'all gon' learn today, boy, that Cas, man, he off his rocker
Don't bust the script on the codeine 'less it come from the doctor

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm back in Sanford with the diamonds on
You ain't got the Rollie 'cause your timing's wrong
Say you working hard but you ain't grinding strong
Them Xanax got y'all feeling lazy, what your mind been on?
In the booth for three months straight, I ain't gon take a break
Y'all on Instagram too much, them hoes you follow fake
I'm inside the kitchen all day, I'm in love with cake
Yeah, my bitch so "super bad" I just might get that hoe a cape
Yeah, hoes all on my timeline, this is not no Twitter, no
I ain't in the gym but I could lift that trigger, whoa
Y'all so pussy, wonder where the rest the litter, whoa
My circle small, that bank roll getting bigger, whoa

[Hook 2]
Y'all gon' learn today, y'all gon' learn
Y'all gon' learn today, y'all gon' fuckin' learn
Y'all gon' learn today, boy, that Cas, man, he off his rocker
Y'all got a problem with the kid, pull up with the chopper, yeah

[Bridge]
Don't be flexin' like you is the plug
I'm on Molly and a lot of drugs
I'm in the studio, I don't do clubs
Seen the clique you rockin' with, y'all a bunch of scrubs

[Hook 1]
Y'all gon' learn today, y'all gon' learn
Y'all gon' learn today, y'all gon' learn
Y'all gon' learn today, boy, that Cas, man, he off his rocker
Don't bust the script on the codeine 'less it come from the doctor

[Verse 2]
Keep Pushin' the squad, man, that shit don't ever change
Been that way since I was young and riding in Bokey, getting change
Back when T was frontin' quarter pounds and shit wasn't always flame
I just did a forty city tour and probably fucked your main, yeah
Birdman on the line, we talking major deals
Y'all be with the games that I don't play, for real
I don't do that Twitter beef, I got the stainless steel
Yeah, CMB just called me, they had great appeal
And they cuttin' checks, they ain't cuttin' yours, all y'all gettin' shorted
'Cause you pussy, don't do proper business, you just got extorted
Get your lawyers right, rumors y'all hear, to me, not important
I got tattoos on my hands and face, you know I don't do corporate

[Bridge]
Don't be flexin' like you is the plug
I'm on Molly and a lot of drugs
I'm in the studio, I don't do clubs
Seen the clique you rockin' with, y'all a bunch of scrubs

[Hook 2]
Y'all gon' learn today, y'all gon' learn
Y'all gon' learn today, y'all gon' fuckin' learn
Y'all gon' learn today, not to play with Cas, he off his rocker
They got a problem with the kid, pull up with the chopper
