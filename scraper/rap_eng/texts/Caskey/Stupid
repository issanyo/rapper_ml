[Verse 1: Caskey]
Shit, Uncle T, immediately, gotta stay for the bag
People who don't work as hard as you, they gonna hate on the swag
Me and a couple of rappers, we done put my state on the map
We got this shit out the mud and all of you laid on your back
Y'all shoot [?] like [?]
Ain't nobody out gonna check my team
He don't even write but he rep my [?]
Man, I'll only be right if I'm [?] lean
I got that Percocet making me spaz
I got the Molly rock mixed with the gas
Most of these rappers ain't fixing to last
I'ma be thriving when all this shit crash, God damn
I'm sipping on Hi-Tech
I'm so damn slow, don't know I ain't died yet
I'm cool with the Pyrex
I'm going to school to shoot for the [?]
And I don't need nobody plug
All of my uncles the middlemen
They see the space and the winklin'
They want a problem? Well then, they can come get it then, ay
They wan' go war with the gods
Shit never even, they play with the odds
And we come to play with the broads
Got the upper hand, I'm ok with the cards
I bet that they stay in they cars
I got a shooter and he make a news clip
I'm here inside of the Porsche
My diamonds so water, I think it's a cruise ship

[Hook: 2hot]
My goons go stupid, fuck with me, they'll lose it
Big money on me, I paid them shooters
If you don't like it then, motherfucker, sue me
Trapping all day, damn, you thought I was Gucci
My goons go stupid, fuck with me, they'll lose it
Big money on me, I paid them shooters
If you don't like it then, motherfucker, sue me
Trapping all day, damn, you thought I was Gucci

[Verse 2: 2hot]
Cruising through your block, got a quarter key on me
Wish you pussies try me, have you calling your mommy
Brains blown out, got him looking like a zombie
Zoo keeper, flow to this beat like Harambe
Move like a snail, catch a shell from the shotty
Lot of homies in jail, no bail for a body
I'm still winning, never call me Mitt Romney
Trafficking marijuana, that's just part of my hobby (Oh man)
2hot's in this bitch, all my hoes with me
Got a brand new bitch shipped from overseas
Man, I hope that pussy clean, [?] and grease
Man, I fuck around and get off in her ovaries
I'm the king of Clay County, everybody know 'bout me
I make the most money out of anyone around me
I rock a big Rollie, what it cost, you can't ask me
Think my money short, you can go and ask Caskey

[Hook: 2hot]
My goons go stupid, fuck with me, they'll lose it
Big money on me, I paid them shooters
If you don't like it then, motherfucker, sue me
Trapping all day, damn, you thought I was Gucci
My goons go stupid, fuck with me, they'll lose it
Big money on me, I paid them shooters
If you don't like it then, motherfucker, sue me
Trapping all day, damn, you thought I was Gucci

[Verse 3: 2hot]
Walking through my trap house, see exactly how I'm livin'
AK-47s and we got the MAC-11s
Send yo' ass to Heaven, we can't trust you like magicians
Make your brain go through your nose, you could say I'm Egyptian
Clientele is very small, canines gonna make that call
If you get to see me or nah and chances are, probably not
Riding in my brand new coupe, I'm speedin', screamin', "Fuck the roof!"
I'm smoking on a big ass doob, I'm high as Wiz Khalifa, dude
Welcome to my kitchen, cooking crack up with them bitches
That's on every trapper's wishlist, call me Santa, Merry Christmas
Every day I'm on a mission, man, we gotta get these millions
You catching colds, I'm catching cases then I gotta hit the witness
I be rolling way too long, like a roller-coaster spinnin'
I been up for way too long and now I'm back and still I'm winnin'
I can see the ho inside of you, I got that double vision
Came from sellin' on that corner, yeah, I call that rags to riches

[Hook: 2hot]
My goons go stupid, fuck with me, they'll lose it
Big money on me, I paid them shooters
If you don't like it then, motherfucker, sue me
Trapping all day, damn, you thought I was Gucci
My goons go stupid, fuck with me, they'll lose it
Big money on me, I paid them shooters
If you don't like it then, motherfucker, sue me
Trapping all day, damn, you thought I was Gucci
