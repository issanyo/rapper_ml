[Chorus]
If both us still got good reception
Why I feel so disconnected?
From you?
From me?
If both us still got good reception
Why I feel so disconnected?
From you?
From me?

[Verse]
You know I want you, ayy
Seem like you lose sight of me, your eyes closed
You know it's fireworks when I touch your skin, it's a light show
Seem like you want me to give up and lie low
You struck a chord with me and it's fortunately a high note
Oh, what's love got to do with it?
I'm so new to it, I'm not used to it
You be playin' them games and it's obvious that I feel for you
You know I want you, babe, and it's honestly not the same
I want you, ayy

[Chorus]
If both us still got good reception
Why I feel so disconnected?
From you?
From me?
If both us still got good reception
Why I feel so disconnected?
From you?
From me?

[Bridge]
If both us still got good reception
Why I feel so disconnected?
From you?
From me?
If both us still got good reception
Why I feel so disconnected?
From you?
From me?

[Chorus]
If both us still got good reception
Why I feel so disconnected?
From you?
From me?
If both us still got good reception
Why I feel so disconnected?
From you?

[Outro]
Seem like you lose sight of me, your eyes closed
You know it's fireworks when I touch your skin, it's a light show
