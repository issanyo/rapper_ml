[Intro]
Yeah (Don Cannon)
I just got out of jail and did like, six racks
Fuck y'all, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
Bit the swag, fresh up out the box
Bitch, I took the Jag, and I'm standing on the plots
I'm a walking tag, yeah, there's value in my thoughts
Gotta pay for that, this a race against the clock
Yeah, yeah, rubber knots

[Hook]
Bitch, the drought is over, yeah, whoa
Bitch, the drought is over, yeah, yeah
Bitch, the drought is over, yeah, whoa
Bitch, the drought is over

[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning, brush my teeth and count a stack
I don't start no problems, I'm just gon' react
Still in Cadillacs, I pour two pints of the Ac'
Let the light come through the crack, I been known for betting black
I been smoking only bags since the 8th grade, I'm servin' now
Peel off in the Jag, Cali kush, what I'm burnin' down
Three hoes in the Jag, (In the Jag!) and my pockets sag
Rich Gang on the tag, (On the tag!) y'all been jockin' swag
Yeah, dope for sale, in the city snitches gonna tell
Out the box, just in time, shit, I'm gon' prevail, yeah
Donut trails in the parking lot, I'm smoking Ls, yeah
Holding bales, gave it to a bitch with golden nails, yeah
Break it off, I wake up, brush the Day-Date off
Rapper that you namin', soft, I can play the boss
I'm hungry like I'm Meek Milly on the second Dreamchasers
And my whole team major, they had it then but that don't mean later

[Pre-Hook]
Take the swag, yeah, fresh up out the box, yeah
Take the Jag, bitch, I'm standing on the plots
I'm a walking tag, bitch, there's value in my thoughts
Gotta pay for that, this a race against the clock

[Hook]
Bitch, the drought is over, yeah
Y'all been thirsting for it
Y'all been thirsting for it

Drought is over, yeah
Y'all been thirsting for it
Y'all been thirsting for it
Y'all been thirsting for it

[Verse 2]
Bitch, the drought is over
Accountant holders, bitch, I'm not this sober
Set up shop in the parking lot and not at Krogers
Really good inside the hood, I ain't work on motors
Matter of fact, I used my mind, I'm on Music Moguls
And I'm juicing up the motor
And you two remind me of quicksand
Lookin' solid but the second you try it no that ain't the lick man
Got the Rollie Day-Date on my arm and it look like a wrist band
Said there's diamonds in this bitch, man
I'm fucking leaning like a kickstand
And my shoulders ice, yeah, I'm work off at the house
Bitch, I'm poltergeist, how I made this off an ounce
Bitch, I'm shooting dice, might just roll a triple six
Got the big ol' blunts, I'm smoking on 'em with the stick

[Hook]
Bitch, the drought is over, yeah
Y'all been thirsting for it
Y'all been thirsting for it
Y'all been thirsting for it
Bitch, the drought is over, yeah
Y'all been thirsting for it
Y'all been thirsting for it
Y'all been thirsting for it

[Outro]
Yeah, bitch
Bitch, the drought is over, whoa, yeah
Bitch, the drought is over, yeah, whoa
No accountant holders, yeah, whoa
Bitch, the drought is over
