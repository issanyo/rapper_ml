[Verse 1]
Ay, I gets plenty rolled
If my cup losing its fix, I gets the Henny po'ed
Into my soul, it's open for public display
That don't mean you finna love what I say
I think we living in a set up, keep your head up
I noticed you're getting hard, the government never let up
Rappers out here telling you "get your bread up" like you ain't working hard
Unlucky mafucker, I don't play with the cards
A peasant tryna play with the gods
Shit unpleasant so I play with cigars, dreaming of cars and the clothes
Thinking there's more to life, but how the fuck I'ma know
When every place I go, obsessed with this dope?
I think I'm blessed to be here in the first place, don't get me wrong
This ain't the worst place, but this ain't home
And lately, it's been harder to relate
With all of these mafucking fakes

[Hook]
And still they ask me why I smoke, I got reasons, yeah
Ayo, they ask me why I smoke
Why I smoke, bitch
Just don't know if you'd believe
And still they ask me why I smoke, I got reasons, yeah
Ay and still they ask me why I smoke
Why I smoke, I got reasons
Just don't know if you'd believe

[Verse 2]
Shit, my momma at home
Getting stressed, the IRS on the phone
See, my father paid these bills a year ago, now he gone
I'm inches from stepping over this ledge, taking [?]
Tryna pull away from thoughts in my head
Images of the past, they follow me, father, he pulled the trigger
Only liquor relaxed me, all I'm thinking is "figures"
How the fuck I been caught in the mixture?
Had to take a step back after mine, survived the crash on the Gixer
It's crazy getting these glimpses of death
Like where the fuck would my mother and sister be if I left?
That shit been stressin' me
Hard to believe that God out here blessin' me
Tryna help my family with this money, next thing these police arrestin' me
Look in my eyes, you'll probably see it
I hope my sister go and forget about them fights, I ain't mean it
The weight of my family been on my back
So just know there's plenty reasons for the way that I act

[Hook]
And still they ask me why I smoke, I got reasons, shit
Ay, what you mean why I smoke?
Why I smoke, I got reasons
Just don't know if you'd believe
And still they ask me why I smoke, I got reasons, yeah
What you mean why I smoke?
Why I smoke
Just don't know if you'd believe

[Verse 3]
Still dealing with these problems since the first grade
Father addicted to medication, medicating in the worst way
Hurt me to say
My sister in and out of jail time visitation, hurt me to stay
I'm praying to a higher power that I never seen
Facing more trials than you had ever seen
Hella mean face to those who ain't been around me
'cause my past made me harder than most, Seminole County
Got the same type of shit that your city got
Both have seen the same situations, running 'round, ducking shitty cops
Difference with me is when the pity stops, I don't crumble
And don't drop the ball, this ain't a fumble
Despite the concrete, we in a jungle
Paranoid, schizophrenic, feeling like my uncle
I ain't tryna take his place, really I ain't tryna catch a case
I'm just tryna make it through today

[Hook]
Still they ask me why I smoke, got reasons, yeah
Shit, they ask me why I smoke
Smoke, I got reasons
Just don't know if you'd believe
Still they ask me why I smoke, I got reasons, yeah
What you mean why I smoke?
Why I smoke, shit
Just don't know if you'd believe the reason that I smoke
