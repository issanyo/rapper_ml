[Intro]
Yeah, check check, uh
Whole lot of Rich Gang shit, ayy
Yeah, steppin' out, yeah, ayy, ayy, okay

[Verse]
Ayy, yeah, three bitches inside the ride with me, ride with me
Yeah, only come fuck with the team if you ridin' with me
Wait stop, ayy, chains on my neck, I don't need your co-sign to me
Yeah, y'all the ones wanted beef, now we in Homicide City
Chains on my neck, I'm skrrt off
Trap from the first to the first, boss
You don't wanna end up in a hearse, dog
Best to stay up out of my way
I'm sittin' in the vert, ayy
Shorty want a boyfriend, I ain't got no time to flirt, yeah
On drugs, everything that I'm seein' startin' to invert, yeah
Grind, yeah, grind like I'm ridin' on vert
Y'all don't want problems, I'll put ya in the dirt
I done made a half a million only off merch
I'm tryna skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt
Shorty want the kid in her skirt, skirt, skirt
Skrt, smokin' on my favorite color
Dog, that's purp, purp, purp

[Chorus]
I'm switchin' up the view like keg stands
You don't want it with me, you a dead man
I'm aimin' at your head, not a leg, man
I'm in the pantry for the bread, man
I'll skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, yeah
Shorty want the kid in her skirt, skirt, skirt
Smokin' on my favorite color
Dog, that's purp, purp, purp

[Bridge]
Ridin' in a two door coupe
Yeah, pullin' up and shootin' out the roof
I'm, stackin' all my money to the roof
Ayy, Baby called me, said that I'm the truth
I'm, ridin' in the 305 in the city
I'm in the club, suckin' on titties
People say I changed, how the fuck I got the whole clique with me
You fuck with me, then you die with me

[Chorus]
I'm sittin' at the top like keg stands
You don't want it with me, you a dead man
I'm aimin' at your head, not a leg, man
I'm in the kitchen for the bread, man
Tryna skrt, skrt, skrt, yeah
Shorty want the kid in her skirt, skirt, skirt, whoa
Smokin' on my favorite color
Dog, that's purp, purp, purp
