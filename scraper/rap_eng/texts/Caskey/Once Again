[Verse 1]
Just got popped in our city, me and my dogs fucked up security
Love life, but on bars people wanna murder me
Hardest motherfucker Baby ever done signed, how you not heard of me?
Y'all listen to that fuck shit, and y'all sleep? that's absurd to me
Artist who ain't never popped coming for my city, always throwing dirt on me
Salt shaker, not dodgin' shit, I'm too clean for the impurity
All Hell broke loose when I came back,  feeling so sure of me
White on white interior, when shit pop off, it's all burgundy
Drinking on Texas and smoking on good
Counting my blesses, I know that I should
King of my city, still misunderstood
They try to stop that shit all that they could
They do not like me and I can't explain that shit, yeah
Y'all got a pistol but, boy, can you aim that shit? Yeah

[Pre-Hook]
Dog, ‘cause we about that action, I don't know 'bout you, dog
We getting this paper, I don't know 'bout you
When they try my lil partner, had that four pound drew
I was on a tour but now I'm back and got the town

[Hook]
Fucked up on that drink, once again
I'm back on the Molly, once again
Walking in the bank, once again
Counting dirty money, once again
Yo' bitch at my spot, once again
Fucked and kicked her out, once again
I'm back on the drink, once again
I'm back on that Molly, once again

[Verse 2]
Once again, once again, once again, I'm off the Molly
When you getting to the dough, can't trust nobody
I'm in every other city, doing shows
Me and yo' girl, she a freak, she fucked the posse
Got me a new chopper at the house
Heard some of y'all was poppin' at the mouth
YGs gon' pop up at yo' store
Got the bands in my pocket, poppin' out, yeah, yeah
I'm drinking coffee and gettin' shit done, I'm on a mission
You unmotivated, you uncoordinated, you always bitchin'
If I was the plug and it was the streets, well then you would be snitchin'
They lock me up, they gon' take everything from me, except my ambition
How can I motivate someone who don't wanna get it? The AM, I'm up in the kitchen
Boy I'm so hungry, I'm flippin' these chickens
My homie doin' the same, but in other ways, and that's something I wouldn't mention
Got your girl all in suspicion, she at the show and I got the flow, got the attention
Got your lil ho at the spot and she lick on her twat while I'm hittin' it all in position
She opposite of a Christian, I'm doing witchcraft, I disappear like a magician
That's why I stick and move, stick and move
Get the money, fuck the rules, let nobody fuck with you
Yeah, you suckers got the tools, but do you know how to use?

[Pre-Hook]
Dog, ‘cause we about that action, I don't know 'bout you, dog
We getting this paper, I don't know 'bout you
When they try my lil partner, had that four pound drew
I was on a tour but now I'm back and got the town

[Hook]
Fucked up on that drink, once again
I'm back on the Molly, once again
Walking in the bank, once again
Counting dirty money, once again
Yo' bitch at my spot, once again
Fucked and kicked her out, once again
I'm back on that drink, once again
I'm back on the Molly, once again

[Outro]
We about that action
We about that action
