[Verse 1: Casper]
Inner city fucking with me, outer city fucking with me
Pulling strings like an all-star, boy, you looking like a gimmick
Oh, you thought that I was finished, I don't stop until the finish
I'm a plug with extension, better listen, pay attention
I don't fuck with the old team them boys act like they know me
They ain't sipping the codeine, they don't know 'bout the OG
She just want me to go deep, "God damn" what she told me
If you knew all about it, you'd be calling me "holy"
I can't stop what you thinking, no
In your speakers, I'm bangin'
Money is the root of my patience
Double up every day, yeah, I'm bankin'

[Hook: Casper]
It's all in the same, I'm going insane, on motors they pushin'
I'm gettin' the trade, I'm takin' the cake, I'm 'bout to be fuckin'
Your bitch for the day, that pussy okay, and when I'm up in it
She screaming olay, she want me to stay, but that shit ain't me
It's all in the same, I'm going insane, on motors they pushin'
I'm gettin' the trade, I'm takin' the cake, I'm 'bout to be fuckin'
Your bitch for the day, that pussy okay, and when I'm up in it
She screaming olay, she want me to stay, but that shit ain't me

[Verse 2: Caskey]
I turn the bank to a playground
I got some killers 'round me and I'm praying they stay down
Second we pull up on 'em, yeah, we making 'em lay down
And we been busin' like a Greyhound
I'm sipping syrup, we in H-Town
Those know me, we not new to this
I'm on that Ludacris, notorious, you gotta Google this
Did a neck piece, did a right pinky ring, so I had to do the wrist
I'm on the offense, I made a shot, that's your cue to miss
Wide lenses on my frames, I can see the lies
I'll pull up in the Bentley coupe to 305
Twenty bitches on me now, I can't trust a soul
I got me a Midas touch, make everything turn to gold
I'm in a ghost, I know some suckers that hate on the kid 'cause they ain't do the most
And they ain't even close, they just pulling up to boast, I just landed on the opposite coast
And we got the money and jewelry, we ain't gotta post
And Baby just gave me a reason to post
We the ones you can't approach

[Hook: Casper]
It's all in the same, I'm going insane, on motors they pushin'
I'm gettin' the trade, I'm takin' the cake, I'm 'bout to be fuckin'
Your bitch for the day, that pussy okay, and when I'm up in it
She screaming olay, she want me to stay, but that shit ain't me

[Verse 3: Casper]
OT, gotta work with that OT
Smoke strong leaf, baby, yeah, you know me
I don't want the half, yeah, I want the whole thing
Young boy gotta get it, he an OG
All of my life, I try to do right, these bitches, they 'round me
I can't ever lie, and they ask me why, but I cannot tell 'em
I gotta get right, the money my life, I gotta stay high
Nothing gon' change, so pour up the Sprite, we don't wanna fly
Fucking around, you know I be wild, I'm breaking it down
They want me now, and they cannot have me, I got the sound
Watch me get down, the women they smile, I'm turnin' them down
I got the style, boy, I be popping, king of the town
Oh, you thought that I blew it? Fell off, now I'm losin'
But I made some investments, now I'm back with some new shit
Casper is a genius, dropped out just to prove it
All you boys with the fake shit, I'm an A+ influence
Yeah, I thought that I told you
I'ma work till a motherfucker old news
Curious about the cash, let me show you
All that time that I spent with the Pro Tools

[Hook: Casper]
It's all in the same, I'm going insane, on motors they pushin'
I'm gettin' the trade, I'm takin' the cake, I'm 'bout to be fuckin'
Your bitch for the day, that pussy okay, and when I'm up in it
She screaming olay, she want me to stay, but that shit ain't me
It's all in the same, I'm going insane, on motors they pushin'
I'm gettin' the trade, I'm takin' the cake, I'm 'bout to be fuckin'
Your bitch for the day, that pussy okay, and when I'm up in it
She screaming olay, she want me to stay, but that shit ain't me
