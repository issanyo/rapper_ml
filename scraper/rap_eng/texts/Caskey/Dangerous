We not cut from the same cloth
Try to play with me you could get knocked off
I got too much drip: hot sauce
Something on my hip that blow your top off

DANGEROUS
Rollin round the city I’m so dangerous
Y’all ain’t fuckin with me I’m too dangerous

I put the pressure plus the pipes in
Move before I speak, lightening
Probably why I’m so enlightening
Haters tryna get like him
All of my life I’ve been underrated but I rise
Hatin on me in disguise
Saying you praying you hope that I fly
But I’ve got to sever the ties
Ghost ride the whip caddillac really flyin
Ghost me a bitch after that 69
Ghost in the parking lot I want it to be mine
White on white my girls
On white I feel like it’s my time
I do my own dirt
And you ain’t push no work
This ain’t a Nextel
But I let my phone chirp
And I’m on a big yacht
Whenever I set sail
I feel like the Sensei
Cuz my money stretch well
Ok dangerous you know I keep that strap on me
Black sheep is who I am actually
Gorillas and dealers in my faculty
Yeah you play with one of my partners
It’s a casualty, cuz naturally...

We not cut from the same cloth

너네 들이 꿈만 꾸던 일이 이제 내앞에
벌어 지고 있어 with cash money artist danm
With caskey 우리 손엔 이제 가득해
지고있지 돈다발이 billion air 까지 way

We never stop 여기 사람들은 말해 dangerous
자칫하단넘어질수있지만 dont care us
빛이 향하는곳으로가고잇지 우린 world
Flakko$& caskey 얻어갈준비를 하고잇지 더

난 대표해 asian
딴놈들은쉿
난 대표해 asian
U now what i mean

딱너네는 거기서
딱거기에위치
딴놈들은 여기서
날못따라오지

난 척을하는 놈들이랑 달러 진짜 좀위험하지
복면따윌쓰지않아 널털때도 마찬가지
Cctv따윈 내게소용없이 난하지
Bb&t 내게들이된들 난진짜라지

We not cut from the same cloth
