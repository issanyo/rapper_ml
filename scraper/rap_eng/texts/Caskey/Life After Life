[Intro: ClicKlak]
I said I'm doing this for y'all
I said I'm doing this for y'all
Yeah, I know I can't sing, but I don't even care, yeah

[Verse 1: ClicKlak]
So many ups and downs, but I keep hope
Who ever thought my hit song would be about dope? (Circles)
Yeah, I sold it, then I whipped it 'cause I had to
I had a mama but I never had a dad to
Fucking help me make a choice
My mama worked every day just to feed her boys
I'm in the streets headfirst, charge after charge
The sad thing is I played sports and I was really smart
But I don't regret a thing, it made me who I am
It's hard to understand
So many loved ones and so many new fans
Became part of my plan, I don't deserve shit
But I got a team behind me who keep pushin' out hits
KPE forever, see, you mean everything to me
Until the day that I'm deceased, I'ma play the game for keeps
Kill a nigga for either one of y'all
Just say the word and they gone, man, I swear to God

[Hook: Caskey]
This is for y'all
For those who mean the most
For those who give me hope
Been in this world for a minute, why we always seem to be broke?
You and me both
We were oh so close
Though we grow apart at times
It's family first, you'll always be in the heart of mine
This is for y'all
For those who mean the most
For those who give me hope
Been in this world for a minute, why we always seem to be broke?
You and me both
We were oh so close
Though we grow apart at times
It's family first, you'll always be in the heart of mine

[Verse 2: ClicKlak]
I do this for the ones who mean the most
'cause once you're dead, then you're dead and I really don't believe in ghosts
You looking down on us, that's what they tellin' us
Expensive ass dreams they keep sellin' us
So why does God make angels forget us?
Why do things get so bad before they get any better?
Wishing for sunshine, going through bad weather
If family means the most, then we sticking together
Now would I be the same ClicKlak
If me and Chris P. ain't start KPE and I just kept selling sacks?
Now would I be the same Lil D
If my mama ain't have to skip meals just so we could eat?
I miss my cousin, man, I really do (Rest in peace)
But every nigga that I shoot make me think of you (Bow!)
I know two wrongs don't make a right
But when I saw your eyes closed, then I lost sight

[Hook: Caskey]
This is for y'all
For those who mean the most
For those who give me hope
Been in this world for a minute, why we always seem to be broke?
You and me both
We were oh so close
Though we grow apart at times
It's family first, you'll always be in the heart of mine
This is for y'all
For those who mean the most
For those who give me hope
Been in this world for a minute, why we always seem to be broke?
You and me both
We were oh so close
Though we grow apart at times
It's family first, you'll always be in the heart of mine

[Interlude: ClicKlak]
Yeah man, you know
I wanna give a number one shout out to my mama
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be here, man
You mean everything to me (I said I'm doing this for y'all)
Ay, and I wanna give a special shout out to the rest of my family
Y'all know who y'all is, you know what I'm saying?
Everything I do, my blood, sweat, and tears
That's all for y'all, man
I miss my cousin, rest in peace P.A.T
I'ma be up there with you one day, my nigga
But right now, I want you to look down on a pimp
And make sure I make it through this shit, man
The streets I live in is crazy, dog, I swear to God, man
But I love Bokey, and I'm doing this for y'all too, man
Stand up for a pimp, let's go, man

[Outro]
Thank you
Hi Daniel
Nine nine?
(Nine nine)
Yes, nine nine
Oh, good boy
Nine pounds, nine ounces?
No, that's his [?] score
Oh, ha ha ha
I'm gonna put him on the scale now
And then you can get his weight in your pictures
