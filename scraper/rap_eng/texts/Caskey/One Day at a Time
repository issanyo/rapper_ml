[Chorus]
Smokin' out the bag, I lose my mind
Long as you go hard, just know it's fine (too hard)
Gotta take shit one day at a time
Gotta take shit one day at a time
Gotta keep this money on my mind
Gotta keep the money on my mind
Gotta [?] on my mind
God'll turn your wish in when it's time

[Post-Chorus]
Just might overdose
Gettin' so high off of life, I just might overdose (damn)
Gettin' so high off of life, I just might overdose
Stuntin' for life, I just got myself the holy ghost

[Verse 1]
Out of my mind, still up at the drop of a dime
I don't drop none of my money on none of these dimes
Tell 'em to hop in the line
Lil bitty bitches, I'm tryna handle the bidness
Only [?] authority, dog, it's the Guinness
I had to go get it, relentless
I'm all in the city, we with it, I mean it, I mean it
She wanna fuck with a pimp, she say she in love with my genius
I step out the clear, I beat up that pussy, I beat up my demons
I beat up these pussies that don't really want it
They say that they want it, they don't really mean it
I had to re-apply that pressure, had to weigh my options
Had to leave my bitch at home, she causin' too many problems
I had to go get the commas, y'all too in love with the drama
All this shit is a dishonor, I work that overtime just like my mama
Smokin' big bags

[Chorus]
Smokin' out the bag, I lose my mind
Long as you go hard, just know it's fine (too hard)
Gotta take shit one day at a time
Gotta take shit one day at a time
Gotta keep this money on my mind
Gotta keep the money on my mind
Gotta [?] on my mind
God'll turn your wish in when it's time

[Post-Chorus]
Just might overdose
Gettin' so high off of life, I just might overdose
Gettin' so high off of life, I just might overdose
Stuntin' for life, I just got myself the holy ghost

[Verse 2]
Man, I peel out on the lot, this life got me comatose
Fuck hoes on the golden coast, trap out all the corner stores
Star life like the Golden Globes, served up all the older folks
High off life, might overdose, high off life, might overdose
Riley tryna pressure me, I fuck 'round, just might own the coast
Yeah, I got this kush from Cali and you know it smokes
Three hoes in the crowd with me, iconic and you know we know
Yeah, I turned the devil down, pulled out that holy ghost

[Bridge]
She wanna fuck with a star player, star player
Parkin' lot, all rare
Serve the city all day
Possibly a ball player
Look at my DNA, it's all player
And look at my mind state, it's not all there
Ayy, ayy, smokin' on that big bag

[Chorus]
Smokin' out the bag, I lose my mind
Long as you go hard, just know it's fine (too hard)
Gotta take shit one day at a time
Gotta take shit one day at a time
Gotta keep this money on my mind
Gotta keep the money on my mind
Gotta [?] on my mind
God'll turn your wish in when it's time

[Outro]
Gotta take shit one day at a time
