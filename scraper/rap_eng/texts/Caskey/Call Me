[Verse 1]
Know I made my mistakes
I ain't mean to say you trippin'
I was wrong about it all (all it)
I would never tell ya different
Where did we go wrong?
I don't know all the specifics
I just wish that I could change it
Go back to a time where all it was so different
So many times I seen her eyes
I couldn't tell the truth, I said the lies
Wish I would never did it from the jump
But that's the way when you caught in the vibes
I wish I could just change for you baby
I ain't mean to cause that pain to you baby (so much pain)
But I know it takes some time to heal

[Hook]
So when you're ready just call (call)
When you're ready just call (call) (x6)

[Verse 2]
Cuz I'll be on a flight from Houston
I know I been sendin' mixed singals and that shit confusin'
I hate it when you don't be answerin my texts and phone calls that shit get abusive
How is we supposed to make changes when you act like talkin' about its a nuisance
I guess since you ain’t gonna hit the reply I just gotta put shit in the music
So baby just hit me on back when you’re ready to call

[Hook]
When you're ready just call (x5)
Know I made my mistakes
I’ll take care of it all

[Verse 3]
All the nights you was layin’ low
Out the country with no place to go
It’s gotta feel weird with no one to hold on
I would break down but you are so strong
All the nights I was layin’ low
Out the country with no place to go
It’s gotta feel weird with no one to hold on
I would break down but you are so strong

[Hook]
When you're ready just call (x2)
Know I made my mistakes
I’ll take care of it all
