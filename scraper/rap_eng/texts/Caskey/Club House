[Chorus]
Every day I'm at the club house (yee yee yee)
I just turned my girl house to a drug house (yee yee whoo)
Every day I'm at the club house (yee yee yee)
I just made the drop off at the club house

[Verse 1]
Yeah, addicted to the getting money, I don't like to spend
Yeah, I just came here for the wins
Gangsta move in silence so my car is like the wind
She started tripping on me so I had to fuck her friend
Just dipped right out the Walgreens parking lot, I'm in the CVS
Turn off my location 'cause the police got the GPS
My partner stole yo' chain, we found out it wasn't VVS
I just popped a Xan and a Molly, I'm mischievous
Put that on my word
I ain't front, she say I own it
Act like I don't even want it
I'm serving pills, I'm in the moment
You just cash that check from unemployment
But my trap been jumpin', I just pulled up at the function
So high off the weed, I don't know if I could function (yea yea)
All my partners trapping daily, money crazy
My favorite catchphrase is "fuck you, pay me"

[Chorus]
Every day I'm at the club house (yee yee yee)
I just turned my girl house to a drug house (yee yee yee)
Every day I'm at the club house (yee yee yee)
I just made the drop off at the plug house

[Verse 2]
Young bull coming up, did shows, I'm balling, I doubled up
Love the lean so much, I put my coffee in double cups
The new Cash Money, all of they problems I covered up
I'm the greatest out, all of ya'll second, you runner ups
If she wanna fuck, don't gotta ask if I'm hung enough
Ain't no cuffing season, I'm dipping after the summer up
Yeah, addicted to the person, I've been hittin' purp
I'm good in your neighborhood, I think you need a different turf
Put that on my word
I ain't hear she want the sex
She told me all that through a text
I'm busy counting up a check
Yeah, I live my life with no regrets
Went from swerving in the Maxima to hopping on a jet
First year I got signed, I spent my whole advancement in a day
Then I fired my whole management and pulled up on the set
And we built that shit back up from square one, that's a bet
I did it all inside the club house...

[Chorus]
Every day I'm at the club house (yee yee)
I just turned my girl house to a drug house (yee yee whoo)
Every day I'm at the club house (yee yee whoo)
I just made the drop off at the club house (yee yee)
