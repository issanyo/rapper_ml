[Chorus]
Yeah
This one for my pops, I made it! (x2)
Yeah
This one for my pops, I made it!
Yeah
This one for my pops, I made it!
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I'm out here gettin' too high
I never knew I'd make it this far
I'm somewhere on the east side of Dallas
Ridin' through the city like a star
Bittersweet cuz
You were supposed to be here by my side
Not in the form of the tears in my eyes
We done planned for this rap shit since I was like 15
Sittin' in the ride bumpin' that first mixtape that I came home with
The look on your face, too proud (too proud)
The worst songs that I ever did dropped but they stayed in the trunk too loud
And as I grew as an artist
You told me that you would stop playin' 'em but you lied
When you left pushed eject from the tape deck saw the CD and I cried
Swear you woulda tripped out on the sold out show that we just did (that we just did)
I don't know why every fan we encounter will long to remind me of you but it just did
Ain't no song I could drop do it justice
Pops.. I think about you all the time
Just stopped by to say that I'm fine and I'm about to make this rap shit mine

[Chorus]
This one for my pops, I made it! (x2)
Yeah
This one for my pops, I made it!
Yeah
This one for my pops, I made it!
Yeah!

[Hook]
Oh my god, i see you clearly now
In my dreams you here with me somehow (x2)
