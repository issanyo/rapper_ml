How the fuck these rappers talk about it like they know it?
How the fuck these bitches walk around like they ain't hoein'?
How the fuck you gon' get on and not put on your homies?
How the fuck you roll around the city like you own it?

[Verse 1]
Okay that’s my city
Pulled up into Orlando where I'm Diddy
Same clique that I came with gon' die with me
I’ll never switch up
My opposition they came forth and then bitched up
Someone said you were the hottest
I think our stories getting mixed up
Man I swear these rappers way too Hollywood I can't relate (Man I don’t feel em!)
Someone get blessed and they just glorify the hate (fuckin haters)
Can't pull me into that with no amount of bait (uh uh)
You kinda late  (ho!)
This ain't the time or place mane

[Verse 2]
Uh uhhhh yea! Please Lord gimme patience
In this world of sin, me and the devil so adjacent
In this world of Benz drivers I'm tryna be complacent
Rockin stolen Timbs.. and I might have to face it
Pulled up into cannabis spots
My chain dangle with amethyst rocks
Y'all lookin like analysts stop tryna dissect me by my watch playa
My mind frame it is far greater
Than the steering wheel that I grip, you just a car hater
Fuck 'em I been there and done it
My hunger revive like it was the mummy
I'm back here to put my foot up in your ass
I get to the money
Never be too sure that that shit is comin'!
Paramount, Im on top of the summit
What a paradox it is that these girls with hundreds don’t keep it 100
These bitches way too Hollywood I can't relate (I can't relate!)
They want the ring but they don’t ever consummate (fuckin  bitches)
Can't pull me into that with no amount of bait (uh uh)
You kinda late, this ain't the time or place mane

Flaw shit! This the fucking Black Sheep mixtape, cause I am the black sheep of this rap shit. Always been in my own lane, I always did my own shit. I wanna thank the universe for aligning all moments to lead to this one moment, right here. I wanna thank all my fuckin haters and nay sayers for breaking down my ego and allowing me to ascend to a higher realm of thinking. I wanna thank you. Yea. Black sheep. Yo its like every time I get online all I see is lies lies lies, it's like they look good but I know their pussy for sale. Keep pushin' 'til the day I die. Cash Money records. Cause I own it. Black sheep
