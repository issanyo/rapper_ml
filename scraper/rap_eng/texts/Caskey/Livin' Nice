[Hook: Mu$sle]
I ain't rich, but I'm livin' nice
The closest thing you'll ever get to a paradise
You might get lucky like a pair of dice
If you play your cards right
You might be going home with me tonight
I ain't rich, but I'm livin' nice
The closest thing you'll ever get to a paradise
You might get lucky like a pair of dice
If you play your cards right
You might be going home with me tonight

[Verse 1: Mu$sle]
You ever been with a man who raps for a livin'?
Freestyle killin', soon to be worth a million
But it ain't from dope dealin', maxin' and relaxin'
Sandy beach, chilling on an island like Gilligan
Doing my own thing, don't give a fuck about opinions
Knock me down, I get back up, I'm too resiliant
I don't blend in, opposite of a chameleon
Do it better than your last man times a trillion
I know you wanna know what it's like to go on private flights
Endless drinks on ice, you a sneak
I don't fuck with mice, I'm too hungry for this shit
I can't control my appetite, pre-game until midnight
Party until the morning sunlight
Make any lady wet, even if she is a dyke
Say I'm not your favorite rapper, don't forget to end with "psych"
I know I'm your type, I know you wanna ride me like an exercise bike

[Hook: Mu$sle]
I ain't rich, but I'm livin' nice
The closest thing you'll ever get to a paradise
You might get lucky like a pair of dice
If you play your cards right
You might be going home with me tonight
I ain't rich, but I'm livin' nice
The closest thing you'll ever get to a paradise
You might get lucky like a pair of dice
If you play your cards right
You might be going home with me tonight

[Verse 2: Caskey]
You ever been with a baller?
Money stacked too high, couldn't call it
Only thing I'm in love with the dollars
Lil shorty wanna bring me home so I can meet her momma
Sorry, but I gotta get this paper or dishonor
Designer dripping on my body, go Illuminati, but my wrist Dasani
And my bitch Kehlani, everything alignin'
Man, these rappers tryna fuck with me, I gotta dismiss 'em
When you rolled the only time you could be dissin'
They wishin', they come up off of me, it's not efficient
Ambition, like I been off working in the kitchen
Used to be at KFC and handling the chickens
None these hoes used to think that I was finger-lickin'
I'm pimpin' in the 305, boy, this different
Shorty see the foreign cars, shorty get addicted
See the paper, wanna get her lifestyle lifted
You lucky if you give her someone who this gifted

[Hook: Mu$sle]
I ain't rich, but I'm livin' nice
The closest thing you'll ever get to a paradise
You might get lucky like a pair of dice
If you play your cards right
You might be going home with me tonight
I ain't rich, but I'm livin' nice
The closest thing you'll ever get to a paradise
You might get lucky like a pair of dice
If you play your cards right
You might be going home with me tonight

[Verse 3: Mu$sle]
Take over the game, it's officially been hijacked
You study every move, it's just a dream to reenact
All the suede on my shoulders, swear I'm being piggy-backed
Only thing I sign is tits and phone contracts
If I see her, I take her, no words, just eye contact
Nine, ten, eleven, one night with me
You'll think you died and went to Heaven
You can tell that I ain't lyin', just read my facial expression
And drop them lames you be fucking with
They ain't giving you nothing, like they in a recession
He on welfare, but he on Instagram, fake flexin'
While I'm on Instagram in the DM's, making business connections
Self-employed, so I'm never piss tested
Only twenty-one, I ain't hit my peak yet
Y'all diving headfirst, I ain't get my feet wet
They hating on the Internet, don't say shit in person, you can bet

[Hook: Mu$sle]
I ain't rich, but I'm livin' nice
The closest thing you'll ever get to a paradise
You might get lucky like a pair of dice
If you play your cards right
You might be going home with me tonight
I ain't rich, but I'm livin' nice
The closest thing you'll ever get to a paradise
You might get lucky like a pair of dice
If you play your cards right
You might be going home with me tonight
