[Intro]
I had to take 'em to church on this one
'cause the devil is alive, and I know it
It's fucking Caskey, bitch

[Verse]
I came through sipping holy water
Boy, go let the gods kill this shit, boy, you know we harder
Michael Jordan shoes on, and I'm sipping Kobe water
Everything a jump shot, yo' girl white Jesus with the cum shot
God's son, I raise hell when the sun drops
Coming from the South, drug sales, and the gunshots (Woo)
Everybody here the hardest out
They gon' start to tell the truth when the fun stops
Analyzed, it went on your blog site
I know that the devil is a lie, but I'm god-like
I ain't with that doing Molly, we all lived the bar life
I been with that cop a script move a hundred bars life
We done had a hard life, I found grace with this rap shit
Now I'm on the couch, pouring Spade, doing backflips, yeah
So Slym, I do this shit for practice
I seen the devil go to church on a baptist
Sunday morning, doing sermons on these black chicks
You was busy meeting up with broads, getting catfished
Hypocritical, I tell it by your tactics
Y'all despicable, you never on my draft pick
I'm rolling 'round my city with a bible in my right hand
Never catch me on the stand though, word
Christ told ya one day he'll come back
They ain't think that he was talking 'bout Orlando

[Bridge]
The devil is alive, yeah
Motherfucker, I'm alive too
Some real, some fake in this trife world
Better start to analyze and decide who
The devil is alive, yeah
Motherfucker, we alive too
Might catch him in the corner of the projects
Might catch him serving orders in the drive-thru
The devil is alive, yeah
Motherfucker, best believe it, boy
The devil is alive, yeah

[Outro]
And he dress like your favorite rapper
Fucking news caster
Church pastor, all that shit, yo
Keep yo' eyes on the screen, hoe
