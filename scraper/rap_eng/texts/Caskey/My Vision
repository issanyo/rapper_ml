[Hook: Itz Prof]
Y'all can't touch my vision (Nope)
I said y'all can't touch my vision (Nah)
'Cause I gave everythin' to get it told my mom I'm on a mission
Thanking God I'm not in prison, on the road to redemption
Y'all can't touch my vision (Nope)
I said y'all can't touch my vision (Nah)
Ralo mother let me hit it, Paula mother let me sip it
On the road every day, but ain't nobody pay attention
Shit, y'all can't touch my vision (Nope)
I said y'all can't touch my vision (Nah)
I'm just tryna make a livin', do the best what I was given
White boy in the game, I'm just tryna make a difference
Shit, y'all can't touch my vision

[Verse 1: Itz Prof]
Been known that I had to go
Had to hit the road to get them shows
'Cause the money don't grow on trees unless you grow
Then chop it down, [?] soul
But I got the devil on my shoulder
Motherfucker tryin' to steal my soul
'Cause if nobody gonna buy it
[?] drugs, you should never try it
Living life like Baltimore
Standing in the midst of bottle riots
Do you smell the smoke?
Did you bring your lighters?
Roll this up, it'll get you higher

Shit, y'all can't touch my vision

[Interlude: Caskey]
Yeah, y'all can't touch my vision, oh
Y'all can't touch my vision, yeah, aw yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Since the jump, I just been putting in work
Making the least, turning my days into weeks
When you putting in my effort
You can't let it go, man, I'm playing for keeps
Got so much vision that people is thinking I'm dreamin'
They thinking I'm sleep
But I been up so many days
I don't know how my body just isn't so weak
I been restless, I been shopping for perfection
I been tryin' to get directions
Only rapper skipped church
And still ain't missing all my blessings
Only rapper skipped class all year
Still ain't no one who could test me
AR burst, I'm catching bodies
Police gotta come arrest me
I still be applying the pressure
I still be applying the pressure
I get on kush and I'm starting to feel
Like my IQ is just high as professor
I get on pills and start to get paranoid
Like everybody against ya
Don't want you winnin', don't want you showing attendance
Don't want you setting them records and gettin' in Guinness
They don't want you in the kitchen
They don't want you at the benefits
Want you out on your ass
Gotta show 'em how to bend the wrist
They ain't like me from the jump
Now they'll never see the end of this
Yeah, they'll never see the end of this
Just like they ain't seen my vision
