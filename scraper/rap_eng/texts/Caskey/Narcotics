[Intro: ClicKlak]
Hey Caskey, you know what we finna do to these niggas now
Hector, what's happening?
Pimp, KPE

[Hook: ClicKlak & Caskey]
On the block with narcotics
Serve it straight out the projects
Please don't make me catch a body
Please don't make me catch a body
All white, Yo Gotti
I heard some niggas was tryna rob me
Please don't make me catch a body
Please don't make me catch a body
Please don't make me catch a body
I'm back in the streets on the narcotics
On that half a pill, dog, what's going on?
I been smoking on the gas, dog, what's going on?

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Lied to by my homie bitch, dog, what's goin' on?
Fuck the world and let 'em die slow, I'm blowin' strong
Light the gas and get my dick sucked, love to fuck when I'm on
These pussies so concerned 'bout me, dog, what's goin' on?
I don't know, I can't cope
I don't give a fuck if y'all stay broke, I gotta go get it
My mama inside of the crib and she living a way I don't want her to
Told her I'm making a million for her and that's what I'm gonna do
Hope it make you uncomfortable
Hope my job start to fuck with you
Hope that you look in the mirror
And realize you fucked up a good situation and damn
That shit start to fuck with you
Hope that you know that we eatin'
Hope that you strugging, breathin'
You turn on the god and now I'm just your demon
You suckers deserving a beatin'
We coming to give it, we mean it, ah!
Schemin' fast with the dollars that I need to cash
She a freak at the show, want the semen 'stache
I'm too focused on my craft for her needy ass
Pull up outside of the spot like, "I need my racks"

[Hook: ClicKlak & Caskey]
On the block with narcotics
Serve it straight out the projects
Please don't make me catch a body
Please don't make me catch a body
All white, Yo Gotti
I heard some niggas was tryna rob me
Please don't make me catch a body
Please don't make me catch a body
Please don't make me catch a body
I'm back in the streets on the narcotics
On that half a pill, dog, what's going on?
I been smoking on the gas, dog, what's going on?

[Verse 2: Pablo Escabear]
Fuck who got it, I rob him, strip him out of his Robin's
Hopping out with them choppers, got a couple bodies on my revolver
Talking fit but ain't 'bout shit, I'll catch you while you're performin'
Slap your old lady, management, entourage in that order
Make the wrong move while the tool on, you'll be donating some organs
Slumped over in the driveway with your tongue out like Jordan
Contraband in my caravan, money doublin', I been hustlin'
Smith & Wesson on my waist band, no tusslin', I'm bustin' it
Been a minute, I must admit, I might be a lil rusty
No face, no case, no evidence, the police mad, they can't touch me
Don't need dogs make the work flip, big guns got long clips
I'm street driving you niggas' whips, straight pussy won't do shit
Fly niggas get wings clipped, bad bitches get hard dick
Double cup, I slow sip, and fast money, I go get
Fuck niggas write statements, crackheads smoke glass dick
I sit back, wack niggas, and count money, I'm ballin'

[Hook: ClicKlak & Caskey]
On the block with narcotics
Serve it straight out the projects
Please don't make me catch a body
Please don't make me catch a body
All white, Yo Gotti
I heard some niggas was tryna rob me
Please don't make me catch a body
Please don't make me catch a body
Please don't make me catch a body
I'm back in the streets on the narcotics
On that half a pill, dog, what's going on?
I been smoking on the gas, dog, what's going on?

[Verse 3: ClicKlak]
Body bags, body bags
Hanging out the window with a gun in my hand
Used to sell rock but I ain't done it again
No more standing on the corner while I'm waiting on fiends
Free my nigga [?]
Can't forget Lil Dre, he been gone since May
I'm pimpin' these women
They give it all to me, they got no decision
Antique thought with a hall of fame wrist
Drink 75 bottles 'cause I ain't poppin' six
I be mixing up the drugs, hope my heart don't stop
Adderall, Xan', Lean, and some Moon Rocks
In a '64 Caprice with the rag top
Ride around Bokey with my rag out
I'm the reason why your uncle got hooked on crack
I'm the reason why your uncle jaw move like that
Swooping all in your baby momma
Gun tucked in my Ferragamo
Can't see, Xans, am I ready?
Live the harder way, feel like Penny
Chasing dollars
Make a bad dealer with your man, Gwalla
Half of my stains, they look like martyrs
Take the narcotics and start to swallow, whoa

[Outro: ClicKlak]
Hey, my nigga Caskey back at it again
This the pimp, ClicKlak, nigga
Black Sheep Tres, you feel me?
Now, I ain't drop no pimpin' on 'em in a while now
So I think it's time I might as well drop some jewels on these niggas, you know what I'm saying?
Now, if you love that bitch
I'ma teach you how you don't care 'bout nothing she do
I want you to look her in her eyes
And tell her, "I always assume you cheating
So I'm never hurt when I find out you is"
Pimpin'
