[Chorus]
Bitch, I gotta go and get the check, go and get the check
Gotta go and get the check, go and get the check
I can't sleep for a minute, go and get the check
Can't sleep for a minute, go and get the check

[Post-Chorus]
I'm motivated, how can I sleep?
I'm formulatin', how to get a G
I'm fornicatin', on a quarter P
I could eyeball like twenty pounds, nobody shortin' me

[Chorus]
Bitch, I gotta go and get the check, go and get the check
Gotta go and get the check, go and get the check
I can't sleep for a minute, go and get the check
Can't sleep for a minute, go and get the check

[Verse]
What motivate me isn't greed, homie, momma need money
In the valley and I'm smokin' on OG, homie
Got a car, Cadillac, throw some D's on it
Lot of haters out here throwin' salt on me, homie
'cause if I give a fuck, popped out, I was sixteen
Now I'm turnin' up, couldn't let nothin' stop me
Tryna level up, think I give a fuck about a hater?
Second that you go through somethin' real, realize nothin' really matter later

[Bridge]
I'm jammin', this ain't no accident, bitch, we planned it
I so live a different lifestyle, they can't understand it
Got tattoos on my hands and face, think I give a fuck?
I still ain't in the unemployed, I had to get a buck and

[Chorus]
Bitch, I gotta go and get the check, go and get the check
Gotta go and get the check, go and get the check
I can't sleep for a minute, go and get the check
Can't sleep for a minute, go and get the check

[Post-Chorus]
I'm motivated, how can I sleep?
I'm formulatin', how to get a G
I'm fornicatin', on a quarter P
I could eyeball like twenty pounds, nobody shortin' me

[Chorus]
Bitch, I gotta go and get the check, go and get the check
Gotta go and get the check, go and get the check
I can't sleep for a minute, go and get the check
Can't sleep for a minute, go and get the check, ayy
