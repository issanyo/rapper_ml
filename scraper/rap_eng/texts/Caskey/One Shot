[Chorus 1]
All i need is one shot, watch me take it
You talking side ways, wonder how long I'll be complacent
I need one shot, home boy
Til you disappear
Ain't no telling what charge i can get this year

[Verse 1]
Lil bit louder, ah
OJ did it, OJ did it
Lil' bit louder brah, just my vocals

Boy i been sippin' different colors
Got things to discover
Get'cho high from this location
This patient just like the other
Boy, we chasing highs, probably explain the lies
Refills almost for free, I'm on it like this the night
This here my one divine zone
One love when i do my thing
You a remain [Blot], I'm bulletproof on my Superman
So all i take is straight shots
Click back and then its lights out
You out of line like DUIs, but i'm on point when the fights out
Boy ain't nobody like me
All these rappers bite me
My bitches get in yo' physique
They work it so you don't like me, but it's hol' up, hol' up, freeze
Cock back then i squeeze
Boy you might got'cha some hands, but there's one thing that i'll need
And that's one shot

[Chorus 1] (x2)

[Verse 2]
Oh and bitch i'm a dog
Wanna feed me bone
Wanna keep me stoned
Wanna pimp my car
Well den' leave me 'lone
Cause you ain't sho' hard when you act so rude
But i ain't cho' dude, so we don't go far
Unless we hit that bar and sip two drinks
You know how it be when you think you'sa star
Well i'm try'na eat good, Don Vito
Hit the club with Starlito
Grab two Jersey girls who like Guidos
Show 'em the falsehoods of their egos
Got dope boys who want kilos
Tell'em pass the bill or get vetoed, but he ain't have the cash
So i T.O.'d, talked to my coach he said the D.O
What i gotta do, so i get mine
All things come in time
If you was all green you'd be lime
And you ain't got blue so you must be five, and you just vibe
Keep my cool
Plus i got a tool up in my ride
So you don't wanna take this here outside
And i'm already high so i don't need five
All i need is one shot
Take that like an alcoholic
Boy if i ain't ballin', i'm not sho' sure as what i should call it
I just evolved it, far from being civilized
And all these hoes know that i'm try'na get in they thighs, so

[Chorus 2]
All i need is one shot, watch me take it
You actin' like you want it, i wonder how long i take it
I need one shot home girl
Til you disappear
Ain't no telling what hoes i'ma get this year (x2)

[Verse 3]
God damn i just be drunk, and actin' ignorant
Intimate with my doobie, I'm Louis Vuitton shotty
Somebody finna' try and sue me, hol' up
Watch me, i'm a rare breed
I ain't an Aries but she get the ram's horn
Wonder why she take care of me
I'm aware i be swervin', swervin', swervin'
Plus i got indo' burnin'
Keep that by the pounds, so all my town know that i'm servin'
Plus i got straight Patron

[Interlude]
(scene of Caskey taking shots with his boys)

Uh, straight Patron shots
Give yo baby momma lock jaw
Plus i keep that blue and white Ciroc like a cop car
I'ma all-star, check my game, tight resume
You ain't 'bout it, 'bout it
You a featherweight so

[Chorus 3]
All you need is one shot, watch me take it
You'a lil' tipsy, but me, i'm try'na get wasted
I need one shot home boy, that put me in double digits
I'm an asshole, i ain't subtle with it
All i need is one shot ha, watch me take it
Finally take yours before i go up and make it
I need one shot home boy, til i disappear
Ain't no tellin' what the fuck i do this year
All i need is one shot
