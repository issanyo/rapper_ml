[Intro: HDTV]
Heavy sauce, man
And we ain't even fumblin'
We just truck stick all the way

[Verse 1: HDTV]
Don't you lie to me
Look at my block, what economy?
This chain tryin' to fly economy
So this just one big monopoly?
Well bitch, I got good at monopoly
The profit margin just adopted me
Fuck nigga tripping, he sizing me
Told my mama, it's only one God to me
High on the sauce and apostrophes
Speak on what the future profits is
You thought them niggas was shinin', ha
I stepped in this bitch on apocalypse
Why your girl smacking her teeth at me
When you know I can't knock her lips?
Pop whenever I speak, nigga
These bitches in they feelings
They was probably typing in the river
Local niggas still acting brand new
Boy, it's looking like you is the ceiling
But I ain't even tryin' to knock you
'Cause petty shit don't even bother me
My dick 'bout to fuck your whole arteries
But we tired of struggling for hardly
Just give me them commas, apostrophes

[Hook: HDTV]
Commas, apostrophes
Commas and apostrophes
We tired of struggling for hardly
Just give me them commas, apostrophes
Commas, apostrophes
Commas and apostrophes
We tired of struggling for hardly
I just want commas, apostrophes
Commas, apostrophes
Commas and apostrophes
We tired of struggling for hardly
Just give me them commas, apostrophes
Commas, apostrophes
Commas and apostrophes
We tired of struggling for hardly
We just want commas, apostrophes

[Verse 2: ClicKlak]
Pablo just called me today (Yay)
Take it out in fifty-five days
Truth is, I met my lil homie
All abandoned [?]
Bare face [?] cold case
Hussein but pimpin', no race
Black, white, Spanish, no Wraith
Two times two, four face
Made a bitch strip just to buy my Rollie
Tabernacle, man, they think I'm holy
Pablo pulled up in a brand new stolen
Hot box, but that my wodie
I break a bih with a cool wrist
Pimpin' preaching from the pulpit

[Verse 3: Caskey]
God damn, we tired of struggling for hardly
Twenty-two killers on Harleys
God bless the next man that come try to harm me
I brought the whole biker gang to the party
Don't you lie to me
You gon' see a whole different side of me
Two pounds of Molly duct taped to the thigh of me
Things we do for the economy
Left out the house with no rims, came back with a Benz
So I ain't so good with the modesty
Most of my friends only want the ends
They don't even speak to me honestly
They all want the gems and gold on they trims
Don't wanna implement the policy
They act like them M's gon' show up outside of they doorstep
And that shit a comedy

[Hook: HDTV]
Commas, apostrophes
Commas and apostrophes
We tired of struggling for hardly
Just give me them commas, apostrophes
Commas, apostrophes
Commas and apostrophes
We tired of struggling for hardly
I just want commas, apostrophes
Commas, apostrophes
Commas and apostrophes
We tired of struggling for hardly
Just give me them commas, apostrophes
Commas, apostrophes
Commas and apostrophes
We tired of struggling for hardly
We just want commas, apostrophes
