[Verse 2: Caskey]
I'm catching the vibe, I'm feeling alive
I play with her pussy inside of the car and I'm feeling like Plies
I'm gripping her thighs, she look in my eyes
She tell me that I am the realest one she know, it ain't no surprise
I'm smoking a bag and I'm piffed up, come and catch these vibes
Can't be stressing 'bout a bitch, too much money in my Levi's
You got too many problems, I need me some me time
Got my money up, but our love on the decline
This is how you park it, tryna top it
All the hate in your eyes, you should drop it
So obnoxious, shit get toxic
So when I pull up this time, bae, let's drop it

[Chorus: Suzi & Caskey]
I'm catching vibes, yeah, he wanna ride, yeah

I'm catching vibes (yeah, yeah, yeah, vibes)
I'm catching vibes (catching vibes, vibes)
I'm catching vibes (yeah, yeah, yeah)
