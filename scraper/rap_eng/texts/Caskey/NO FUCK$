[Hook: Tyla Yaweh]
I said I hopped inside my whip, with my bitch
Yeah, you know we tote banana clips
I jump inside the club, I give no fucks
Yeah, I pour Patron in my cup
I'm slumped, you know, I'm slumped
I give no fucks, I give no fucks, yeah
I know I'm slumped, oh, yeah
I give no fucks, I give no fucks, yeah
I said I hop inside my whip, with my bitch
Yeah, you know we tote banana clips
I hop inside the club, I give no fucks
Yeah, I pour that lean in my cup
I'm slumped, yeah
You know I'm slumped, I give no fucks
You know I'm slumped, yeah, yeah
I give no fucks, I give no fucks

[Verse 1: Tyla Yaweh]
What to do today: I'ma get some yay
I might pop a Xan, I might fuck yo' bitch
I might front a brick, I wanna be rich
I gotta get bands, throw it on your bitch
She knows, yeah (She knows)
A nigga do be on, I'm 'bout to blow
And yeah, she knows, yeah
I give no fucks, got bands in my hands and I throw, oh

[Hook: Tyla Yaweh]
I said I hop inside my whip, with my bitch
Yeah, you know we tote banana clips

[Verse 2: Caskey]
You know we tote bananas, my lil bruh got Arm & Hammer
Trap like out Atlanta, my big sis jumped out the slammer
All of yo' shit moving slow
We make the fishscale jump out of the bowl
Got my lil tool looking like it's a fo'
But that's some shit that you already know
See us inside of the club, dripping the pop off
Got your lil bitch taking her top off
I got the sauce, don't mean the hot sauce
You taking orders, that mean you not boss
Pull the whip out, goals, and your bitch got drums
I just did a 40 city tour 'round the country
Spent the profit on clothes
I just took your bitch back to the crib
Fucked then kicked her out, I got hoes
Hit that like I'm with the pros
My home improving like I been in Lowes
And your whole clique get exposed
Pull up outside of the spot and I'm swinging the do's
Me and Tyla got these rappers on toes
We ain't something to oppose
I got your bitch in a Rolls
Hop inside my whip, I'm flexin'
I just made Benjamin my best friend

[Hook: Tyla Yaweh]
I said I hopped inside my whip, with my bitch
Yeah, you know we tote banana clips
I jump inside the club, I give no fucks
Yeah, I pour Patron in my cup
I'm slumped, you know, I'm slumped
I give no fucks, I give no fucks, yeah
I know I'm slumped, oh, yeah
I give no fucks, I give no fucks, yeah
