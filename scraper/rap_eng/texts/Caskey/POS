[Intro]
Ha, shit, ha
She say i'm a p.o.s
Bitch, it's probably true

[Verse 1]
Damn, am i atrocious or aggressive
Don't like my approaches
We don't ever split up
Someone call Moses, this is ridiculous
I say, "Fuck you!"
She approach with the fist up
We in rush hour
Eyes black like Chris Tuck
Only way i fix this here, get my dick suck
Oh ya i'm a sick fuck
Sick of probation officers holdin' piss cups
Picture me in Pittsburgh
With Jerome Bettis
Getting lettuce while i sip syrup
And i got a fetish for Alexis in a thin skirt
Shit i'm a dog but a pimp first
Pinnacle of dollar bill inserts
Significant worth, i'm a jerk though
Treat her like she only want a dollar bill from me
And a fur coat
But she want love
I'm dessert cold
See her every nine to five
But we don't work so


She say i'm a P.O.S
P.O.S., P.O.S., P.O.S
Fuck you, she say that i'm a...
Shit, you sayin' im a P.O.S
Fuck you

[Verse 2]
We exchange perceptions
She don't say nothing positive
Say i don't know women and they prerogative
Say that technically we are opposite
She a nice girl
I'm a wolf inside a metropolis
Obvious i got my insecurities and impurities
And ambition for currency
But currently she was working on herself
Said she had her bags packed
Be moved out by the twelve
Well fuck it, you took your heart up off the shelf
I slain mine
They say that love is a casualty
No it's petty crime
And they ain't got no justices
They just got grapevines
And the rumors they travel far
You gonna hate mine
I tell 'em you fucked every motherfucker in my whole clique
And my old bitch
And the man that you met at Fubar in the two car in '06
Like oh shit
You say i'm a piece of shit
Well it's probably true bitch
I'm just making peace with it, and

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She tell me that i'm the bad guy
Hit her with low blows
She set appointments
I give her no show
See us together but i am solo
With red cups and she fed up with seeing
These photos with bimbos that's online
"fuck's yo problem"
Kicked me out of that room
Late night when she found them condoms in my pocket
Tried to say they wasn't mine
I'm a damn lie
And i'm suckin' her dry
Who is the vampire
At first she's bitin' on me
There is left hooks
She went Tyson on me
Told me that i ain't shit
Started throwin' vices on me
And that's when i get name callin'
And i bring up fights with her father
And the temperature inside the room
Just get hotter
And i ain't takin' shit from a stupid bitch yo'
And that's a promise
And she tell me, "Be honest, like did you love me?"
And i say, "Hell nah bitch, it was a fuck thing."
And that's why i'm a P.O.S

[Outro]
Piece of shit
I get that one a lot
You know, like i just don't got the patience to be dealing with this shit
And, and this is who you are dealing with bitch
A stone cold individual
I've been called heartless, asshole
But they say that i'm a P.O.S
