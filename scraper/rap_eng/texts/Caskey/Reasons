[Chorus: Father Lucas]
Would you believe in all of my demons
Even though you couldn't see them?
Keep it a secret, you know I'm bleedin'
Close the door, no one should see this
Codeine I'm fiendin', hide in the shadows
Shorty, you know that I'm creepin'
Give me a reason, shorty
Just give me a reason why I keep breathin'
Would you believe in all of my demons
Even though you couldn't see them?
Keep it a secret, you know I'm bleedin'
Close the door, no one should see this
Codeine I'm fiendin', hide in the shadows
Shorty, you know that I'm creepin'
Give me a reason, shorty
Just give me a reason why I keep breathin'

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Give me a reason, ayy
Give me a reason, that I should live any more seasons
I talk and I come off indecent
I'm used to havin' my convos with demons
This battle, I'm shoppin' at Niemans
Bad lil bitch in the back seat, I'm easin'
My way inside of her skirt
She on a Perc and a handful of semen
Feel like I'm dreamin', feel like I'm dreamin'
I doze off, it's not even evenin'
I'm high, way too high to believe it
I got a blessin', she tryna receive it
Yeah, yeah, she throw me her body
I don't even need it
I'm way too focused on money
And tryna make sure that my team is eatin'

[Bridge: Caskey]
Feelin' vexed sometimes
Disappear into this well
I'm on X sometimes
My ex is tryna smoke a L (bitch)
Gettin' high sometimes
Tryna 'scape from the lows
That shit they don't even know
They see the surface and think that that's all that I show

[Chorus: Father Lucas]
Would you believe in all of my demons
Even though you couldn't see them?
Keep it a secret, you know I'm bleedin'
Close the door, no one should see this
Codeine I'm fiendin', hide in the shadows
Shorty, you know that I'm creepin'
Give me a reason, shorty
Just give me a reason why I keep breathin'
Would you believe in all of my demons
Even though you couldn't see them?
Keep it a secret, you know I'm bleedin'
Close the door, no one should see this
Codeine I'm fiendin', hide in the shadows
Shorty, you know that I'm creepin'
Give me a reason, shorty
Just give me a reason why I keep breathin'

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Put me inside of your locket, ayy
Put me inside your darkest place
You know the truth, it's hard to face
I got a blunt and it's hard to face
They say that love like a storm, that girls is hard to chase
Ridin' 'round, like we never stopped it
Don't go online, it's a lot of gossip
I read through the lines, you just wanna pop shit
Love is a concert, I'm in the mosh pit
Don't do no opp shit, I'm in the eye of the storm
I got my eye on her form, I got a nine and a four, both of 'em ask me for more, yeah
Places inside of my mind I don't wanna explore, yeah
Most important places are the ones we ignore, yeah
