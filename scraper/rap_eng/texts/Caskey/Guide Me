[Chorus: Justina Valentine]
A message in a bottle
I hope that you can read it
Your love has been misleading
And i have lost my way
(Drinking my sins away)
Nobody can find me
And my heart has been hiding
So please i need some guiding
So come guide me

[Verse 1: Caskey]
I fuckin' hate this bottle of Jack Daniels
It turn the light in my eye into black candles
Man i swear life sho' is a beach
And i lack sandals
This alcohol tarnish the street
And the trap vandals
I sipped whiskey there at the funeral of my pops
That bottle my uncle's gift, unusual it was not
I cried alone
Drunk and i'm tired of home
I woke up in a jungle no lion could roam
Dyin' for a second good-bye
They say that time the healer of all
Well i reckon you lie
I look at god, "are we destined to fly
Or chained to the ground til we rest in the sky?"
Sometime i wonder man
My father like to drink sometimes
And they say the apple land a 'lil closer to the tree sometimes
Than it should, but he ain't the one to blame
Cause he was as lost as i
And we are one in the same
I been drinking my sins away..

[Chorus: Justina Valentine]

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Ya, okay
Look i don't know what top shelf liquor is
I just know the bottle sittin' on my top shelf is ridiculous
All my actions are conspicuous
I look into the mirror so disgusted
I don't know who the figure is
My family been falling to pieces, i tried to save 'em
But my parables are nothing like Jesus
I can't relate, nah
He was sure of his fate
I'm never sure of anything
Not to mention my body covered in hate
I hate Oxycontin takin' my kin
I hate the devil for sin
I hate Tanqueray for makin' this gin
Feel like i'm lyin' every time that my momma ask
Where i've been, i'm drownin'
Try'na float in this pool of liquor i'm in
Look, my father like to drink sometimes
And they say the apple land a 'lil closer to the tree sometimes
And it should but he ain't the one to blame
Cause he was as lost as i
And we are one in the same
I've been drinking my sins away..

[Chorus: Justina Valentine] (x2)
