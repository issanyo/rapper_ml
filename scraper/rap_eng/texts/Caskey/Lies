These fuck boys be telling lies
I can see it in they eyes (Lies)
You is not about the ride (Lies)
You is not about that life
Swear these hoes be telling lies
Yeah, always say the pussy fire (Lies)
Always say they down to ride (Lies)
Always two or three on side
Fuck these boys, be telling lies

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Been the same since I hopped out the womb
Be the same 'til I'm lying in the tomb
Motherfuckers talk to twelve like it's noon
I'm pulling up and running off of fumes
Got the molly, santan and the [?]
Had to serve 'em at a private location
Arise so patient, I'm sitting in a high formation
We outer space, but our eyes on the stars
Me and plenty rappers put our lives in the bars
But they tell a couple lies 'bout the parts and the cars
Have they running 'round, dying for a cause
They been tryna face since the get go
I done really served ten thousand pills and the shake at the Citgo
I'm tryna turn to Diplo
Man, they sitting on a high horse
But the Rolls phantom gotta dip low
I'm going harder than a martyr tryna get dome
Standing on the cross smoking Indo
And I been going hard, gotta face it
Y'all on Xans every day, motherfucker
That's back to the basics?
That's a whole lot of talent being wasted
I'm the opposite, I'm going ape shit
Got a poker hand full of aces
And I'll be God damned if you stand there, lying on they faces
We calling out your bluff 'cause you lied 'bout a lot of information
Fuck boy

[Verse 2: JG]
Look, faded while reading Fader
I got no write up, I keep on waitin'
I cut the light up and see these haters
I'll fuck your life up, you keep on hatin'
I'll pull the baddest bitch, leave her waitin'
I do my shit just to make a statement
I pour a double up, fuck a chaser
So what the fuck I look like, chasin'? Yeah
I'm still blowing up, I'm busy counting checks still
Out here signing shit, I'm tryna get next deal
Line blowing up, it's chirping like a Nextel
I'm blowing up and now [?]
I was born to rock a SSL
Tryna step to me? Man, you funny guys, should be on SNL
Money, all I hear is money ringing, extra bells
Giving hell to your squad, you taking extra L's
I lay my bitches as you weather down X and pills
For Netflix & chill, she just give me sex then peel off
That's like everyday shit
I'm clock to clock with it still, yeah
I want this shit, I'll take it
Might go to penthouse up from the basement
I see my enemies changed they faces
I think they fakin'
