[Chorus]
I'm in the cut
I'm in the cut, and I've been pourin' it up
They wish that we didn't make it
But I guess they down on they luck
I'm in the streets
I'm in the streets, and I've been playing for keeps
They wish that we didn't make it
But look at how much [?]

[Verse 1]
Gotta tell 'em to watch for the yellow tape
If I go out shooting, then celebrate
These bad women choosin', I sell the weight
You mad 'cause you losing [?] hate, I can't pay it mind
I'm in the streets
I let that shit go, but I'm playing for keeps
I'm in the field, man, they stay under sheets
Me, I just stay with my piece, lay low and pray I'm at peace
Heard you out looking for me
Fuck 'round, gon' get what you seek, yeah, yeah
Fifty shots, I'm fifty deep
Looks like we won all the beef, yeah, yeah
I'm in a whole different world that you don't even know about

[Chorus]
And I'm in the cut
I'm in the cut, and I've been rollin' it up
They wish that we didn't make it
But I guess they down on they luck
I'm in the

Matter fact, I'm getting more impatient
Money counters all inside the basement
Counting up my only inspiration
I'm in the cut
I'm in the cut, and got a whole crew of sluts
Bang on my chick, let her drool on my nuts
Fuck her, she screwed up my dutch, yeah
Roll through the city, manuever the clutch
We fuck with who fuck with us
Still don't know who I could trust
On one and boot up, I must, yeah
I'm in the streets
I'm in the streets, look at the blood on the leaves
Look at how all of these people done switched up
And went [?]
I used to be riding around Winter Springs
With a trunk full of P's
Now I'm just booked overseas
They tried to stop me, I came back a beast

[Chorus]
I'm in the cut
I'm in the cut, and I've been...
