[Intro: Caskey]
Lil bitty bitch, it's Rich Gang or don't bang
Young Cas, High Rollaz
All that other shit's some fuck shit

[Verse 1: Accomplice]
I don't tuck a chain, I just tuck a burner
And I ain't gotta touch it, I just send a runner
Whole team down till we came up
Clique ain't never changed, bitch, we leveled up
Man, fuck the foreign, pull up Impala
We're grade A scammers, talking top dolla
Some bad bitches, top shelf marijuana
Niggas OD, lit like there ain't tomorrow
Super unleaded what we roll up
Yellow diamonds brighter than a school bus
Now I'm counting hunnids till my hands blue
Once the work touch down, it get ran through

[Hook: Cortez]
They know, they know
Top shelf, we only blow that fuego
Four lines I pour up with my drink, oh
I got my relish, jumping on the payroll
Oh they know, oh they know
Top shelf, we only blow that fuego
Four lines I pour up with my drink, oh
I got my relish, jumping on the payroll
Oh they know, oh they know

[Verse 2: Caskey]
I'm trapping with the Molly, Santana, and I feel like Fredo
I fuck with shorty on the low and that's some shit that they know
I got two Dracos in the house, I ain't got time to lay low
My big bro riding with me, made his whole come up on yayo
Sip forty ounces in public houses
No security or bouncers, we shoot at counselors
Lil bitch with me throwing tantrums, we off at mansions
How I left here in a bucket, came back in a Phantom?
How I left here with two pistols, came back with a ransom?
White girl in the trunk with me, I call it "Marilyn Manson"
Second that you get the sack they start to think you handsome
Got that dirty in my cup, girl, we been dirty dancin'
That's some shit that they know

[Hook: Cortez]
They know, they know
Top shelf, we only blow that fuego
Four lines I pour up with my drink, oh
I got my relish, jumping on the payroll
Oh they know, oh they know
Top shelf, we only blow that fuego
Four lines I pour up with my drink, oh
I got my relish, jumping on the payroll
Oh they know, oh they know

[Verse 3: Word Life]
Your bitch'll count it till her hand blue
Fronting on that fake shit what we can't do
Money on the counter, got that money counter
Feeling like I'm 50, bitch, I got that power
My hustle timeless, nigga, I gotta get it
My struggle lie on couple dimes, nigga, I gotta flip it
From no pot to piss in, feeling so [?]
And now my diamonds be shining just off of my ambitions
Fuck your honor, your [?], your propositions
My designer drippin' off the side like when that water whippin'
Now we far from whippin', blowing that fuego
High Rolla life, represent so they know

[Hook: Cortez]
They know, they know
Top shelf, we only blow that fuego
Four lines I pour up with my drink, oh
I got my relish, jumping on the payroll
Oh they know, oh they know
Top shelf, we only blow that fuego
Four lines I pour up with my drink, oh
I got my relish, jumping on the payroll
Oh they know, oh they know
