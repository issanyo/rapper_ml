[Intro]
Let's ride, let's ride tonight, let's ride tonight

[Hook]
My homie from the Westside always scoop me in his Cadillac
Hunnid pounds of kush, yeah, officer, this for the cataracts
I be up in Bokey all the time, that's where the savage at
Rap gon' make a million dollars, let me take a stab at that
Cruising through the Westside, I'm inside the Cadillac
She gon' suck your wallet dry, swear that she ain't bad at that
Women tend to lie, when they lie to me, ain't mad at that
I just got my baggage packed, looking for a show, eh - let me grab at that

[Verse 1]
So high in the City of Angels, think I'm at the summit
We out in Cali, I'm constantly blunted
Just ‘cause you got it don't mean you should stunt it
A handful of hunnids don't make you a hunnid
Folks do it all for the Gram, gotta see through the lines
Gotta learn how to tell
Gotta distinguish between the ones who want you down
And the ones who want see you prevail
No way I could fail, Baby just called me
Said, "Cas, when you come back, bring two hunnid bales"
I'm at the grow house in Cali
Like, "Yeah, I could do that, but is that to smoke or to sell?"
Wasn't surprised when he said it was personal
We doing shatter and I grab the nail
I just taught Stunna how to take a dab
He said, "White people crazy as hell!"
Live up to my reputation, getting road head while I'm driving
She know it's my meditation
And the way I'm looking at the competition
Y'all must really be on medication
They ain't fucking with me and they know it
Went from a local dealer to a poet
Went from the Natty Ice to sippin' Moët
We ain't finna blow it, don't need your plug ‘cause we grow it

[Hook]
My homie from the Westside always scoop me in his Cadillac

Rap gon' make a million dollars, let me take a stab at that
Cruising through the Westside, I'm inside the Cadillac
She gon suck it while I drive, swear that she ain’t bad at that
Women tend to lie, when they lie to me, ain't mad at that
I just got my baggage packed, looking for a show, eh - let me grab at that

[Verse 2]
Ever pop so much that you up for hours?
Feel like there's cameras on all of the towers?
X made me fuck that girl like Austin Powers
Her pussy wet like we went in the shower
She fuck with my style (she fuck with my style!)
Don't know when my plug gon' get back the Sours
Them my favorite type of flowers
I got no use for the kind that they throw in the aisles
Skrrt then I skrrt off, first off
We in love with money, not these bitches with they shirts off
My homie got the rock hard and the dirt soft
Ain't shit sweet, he a star but he down to let the burst off
Hold up, wait. That's how I'ma kick the verse off
I brought change to the game but at times it can derail
God damn it, I guess everybody worst off
Vibe, he wasn't supposed to slide
How is we gonna survive?
Bagging up the dope, can't cope with the vibe
Praying to the Pope and you hopeless deprived, well I wrote this alive
Mixing my sin with the lean and I'm pouring codeine in the Sprite
Two hunnid Xans, I'ma serve 'em tonight

[Hook]
My homie from the Westside always scoop me in his Cadillac

[Outro]
Baby, we can go into the back seat of the Cadillac
Getting high, we floating through the sky up in the Cadillac
Serving everything in all the places that the savage at
Blowing out the kush, I know my haters really mad at that
Baby, we can go into the back seat of this Cadillac
Getting high, we floating through the sky up in this Cadillac
Serving everything in all the places that the savage at
Blowing out the kush, I know my haters really mad at that
