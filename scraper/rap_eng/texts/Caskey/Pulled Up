[Intro]
Yeah, Pollen
And Caskey

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Pull up, my mental, I cannot be compared to no one
This here presidential
No, this car, it not a rental
I'm doin' business here, but it's residential
I look at my fans, they ridin' for me
My appeal is so existential
I paved the way with a pencil
You come in here, gotta show me credentials
I pull up everywhere I go with two hunnid cash
Smokin' a QP of hash
Lookin' like I'm built to last
Big fuckin' number on my car dash
And my bitch bad, she might be Kardashian (oh)
It look like a bed full of cash she in (oh)
It look like I'm never goin' nowhere
I'm bettin' money nobody surpassin' him
I'm throwin' up too many thou (thou)
It's up, but it's comin' down (down)
I ain't ever comin' down
In a foreign country where they love my sound
Feel like I run the whole town here (yeah)
Can't bring that fuck shit around here (ayy)
Try me, pull up on myself
Pussy boy, I'm really out here

[Chorus]
I pulled up with a hunnid thousand dollars cash
I'm smokin' pressure, pussy, what you got inside your bag?
On that Krunk Kreation, homie, man, I swear this shit is gas
From that weed we smokin', you could smell it from the back
'cause I pulled up with a hunnid thousand dollars cash
I'm smokin' pressure, pussy, what you got inside your bag?
On that Krunk Kreation, homie, man, I swear this shit is gas
From that weed we smokin', you could smell it from the back
'cause I

[Verse 2]
I be on that Plushie Pines, it got me feelin' right
I be on that Krunk and bumpin' to the ceilin', lift off
No comin' down until I'm landin' in New Zealand
Catch a big fish, nigga, let me reel it
On that boat with the wax drip, sprinkled with some hash
I'm just coastin', tryna switch lanes on every ave
I ain't boastin', nigga, I'm just grindin' in the lab
Double dippin', blunts over these lines and they be crack
So if you hittin', pardon the pipe, I'm all about my paper
Wrappin' it up with a piece of the leaf, then I'ma roll up a chaser
Nigga, my lungs are Darth Vader, and I ain't forcin' it
I like my fantos on the dark side, shit

[Chorus]
I pulled up with a hunnid thousand dollars cash
I'm smokin' pressure, pussy, what you got inside your bag?
On that Krunk Kreation, homie, man, I swear this shit is gas
From that weed we smokin', you could smell it from the back
'cause I pulled up with a hunnid thousand dollars cash
I'm smokin' pressure, pussy, what you got inside your bag?
On that Krunk Kreation, homie, man, I swear this shit is gas
From that weed we smokin', you could smell it from the back
'cause I

[Verse 3]
What up, my partner?
You already heard about me and I need it for cash
I rolled up the weed and I pulled up
OG made the beat and I feed it to Cas
Rolled up the beat like "oh boy"
Bumpin' that bass in the back
I pulled out that mill
And they give me that feelin' whenever I'm on Lincoln Ave
I'm fillin' the blunt like "oh dog, somebody cushion it"
I'm tellin' my bitch like "hold on, where is my pussy at?"
I'm gettin' my sour, just rolled up the pollen, [?] powder
And if [?] right after, I'm hittin' the sour
You hear me, baby? I'm the baddest, I can vouch ya
And I get needed every time I'm on the roster
So give me a minute, I roll it again, damn, I swear we can hit it
And this is Pollen, I promise that I am comin' to get it

[Chorus]
I pulled up with a hunnid thousand dollars cash
I'm smokin' pressure, pussy, what you got inside your bag?
On that Krunk Kreation, homie, man, I swear this shit is gas
From that weed we smokin', you could smell it from the back
'cause I pulled up with a hunnid thousand dollars cash
I'm smokin' pressure, pussy, what you got inside your bag?
On that Krunk Kreation, homie, man, I swear this shit is gas
From that weed we smokin', you could smell it from the back
'cause I
