Yo figure insane
The second that you open your mouth
I figure out whats been killing your game
It's sorta like talking to a vegetable
Except i know greens that are far more interesting to me
And intellectual, you the typical instagram
Got you some fans type
Don't need a man type
And seen you on BangBros
Suppose you ain't the fuckin' the van type
You only fuckin' if he your man righttt.. bitches be lying
Full of life, ho picture me dying
I've thirst over thirsty bitches who tryin
Too much to sustain a fake image
They ain't about business
I tell the truth with god as mine witness
Man these playa's they ain't in it for the captivating conversation
You must be poppin' mushrooms think they lookin' for some consummation
They ain't even givin' compensation
They fuckin' one time before they main chick bring the confrontation
This the type of shit that got you contemplatin'
That's a thought formulatin' thoughts
That pussy bought
All that social media type fame ain't really brought
What you thought it would
You done been caught inside the cycle
