[Verse 1]
I wonder if two thousand shells will be the end of me
Probably not, Molly popped, destiny was pre-determined
Still I got these vermins that are oddly shocked
They don't like to see me with no Godly watch
Let alone some icey stones that cover all my body
Watch, the hate emerge, absurd how my talents
Which are rather ordinary brought extraordinary balance
The malice, they just want a sip out of my chalice
But reality don't favor them, angels in the field
But they don't play for them
Roll around my city, got no play for them
At dinner I might pay for them
But they ain't eating shit that's on my plate
Boy, it's paper thin, lines dividing love and hate
Hate it when a saint destroy, love it when a thug create
The smoke that billow outside of my window, it might suffocate 'em
Few will hate him but they damn sure know my lines verbatim
It's like the Salem witch trials
Which trials and tribulations brought me this style?
This is how a young child rise to his accolades, my time in FLA
Well that was for preparation and now it is set to play
Its hard to be brave when facing a giant
But it's hard to make a change when you silent

[Hook]
Ayo, this could be my last ride
Shit, I crashed up on that GXR
I get these flashbacks
Like every time that I hit this swisher
Boy, my last ride
It could be like any day
And I'm just tryna find my way
And I ain't perfect, homie
This could be my last ride
It's like Final Destination
Many fell before the shit
I rise to the occasion
For my last ride
'Cause it could be like any day
And I'm just trying to find my way
And I ain't perfect, homie
This could be my last ride

[Verse 2]
I still count my blessings
Got a keen eye for deception, never rely on impression
Never deny your discretion, mind manifest life
Numbers tell the truth, home boy, and the rest lie
Well, three eyes of mine reading books of Eli
Ever since I was knee high I knew there was something greater
That paper, it wasn't me, I felt a calling
Many would sell they soul for some dollars and chains
But I been keeping mine just to see how a scholar could hang
Amongst these killers, drug dealers and thuggish figures
And some find it strange that I realize we are one in the same
I seen they image but that's all in the frame
I like to dig inside they mind, see what's inside they brain
Many rappers would change tryna get a chain
But that ain't what my plot contain
Man I'm possibly way too optimistic, some would speculate
But your only life is hard to replicate

[Hook]
Ayo, this could be my last ride
Shit, I crashed up on that GXR
I get these flashbacks
Like every time that I hit this swisher
Boy, my last ride
It could be like any day
And I'm just tryna find my way
And I ain't perfect, homie
This could be my last ride
It's like Final Destination
Many fell before the shit
I rise to the occasion
For my last ride
'Cause it could be like any day
And I'm just trying to find my way
And I ain't perfect, homie
This could be my last ride
