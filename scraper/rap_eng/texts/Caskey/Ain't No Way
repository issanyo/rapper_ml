[Intro: Cityboistreets]
Look, ain't no fucking way
That a young nigga dripping with the sauce, I keep the K
Whoa, facts, oh

[Hook: Cityboistreets & Caskey]
Look, ain't no way
I've been dripping with the sauce, they like, "Ain't no way"
I've been rolling, smoking dope, they like, "Ain't no way"
I've been trappin', I've been rappin', they like, "Boy, ain't no way"
Ain't no way
Yeah, ain't no fucking way, yeah
Ay, yeah, ain't no fucking way
I've been rolling, smoking, shooting out the roof, ain't no way
How you think I'm 'bout to lose? I'm in the coupe in LA
Ain't no way

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Man, the streets wanna call me back, I gotta stay away, away
Man, I beat up on that pussy like a 808, 08
Man, I pop one too many mollys, might just stay awake, awake
Counting up big checks, finger fucking on the blue hunnids with the index
Money like my only interest, I was hitting stains tryna invest
Okay, shorty want me fuck her 'til her cuchi breaks
I can't fuck with none these snakes unless they brand new Gucci snakes
And my diamonds so damn water, ain't no need to lubricate
Got a brand new Rollie on me, still I'm tryna renew the face
Sipping on Screwtape, when your money start to double, some people get two-faced
Keep that fire like Liu Kang, I'm with the gang like Wu-Tang

[Hook: Cityboistreets & Caskey]
Look, ain't no way
I've been dripping with the sauce, they like, "Ain't no way"
I've been rolling, smoking dope, they like, "Ain't no way"
I've been trappin', I've been rappin', they like, "Boy, ain't no way"
Ain't no way
Yeah, ain't no fucking way, yeah
Ay, yeah, ain't no fucking way
I've been rolling, smoking, shooting out the roof, ain't no way
How you think I'm 'bout to lose? I'm in the coupe in LA
Ain't no way

[Verse 2: Piffboyz JT]
Lord, in LA
All my haters fade away, I guess they never can relate
I get so high, look, I'm so fly, I just might be outerspace
They can never understand, I just blew a couple bands
I got the drip, woo, ooh, just made it flip, ooh, ooh
Versace my clothes, ooh, ooh, money my wrist (bling)
Fuck what you mean, yeah, ay, we chasing this green, ay, ay
I'm smoking on threes, ay, ay, your bitch wanna please, ay, oh

[Verse 3: Piffboyz Ziggy]
Ah, had to get it with my day ones
Killed the beat like I'm Jason, chopper sound like a base drum
Run up on me, get your face done, tote the forty like a paint gun
Wrist frozen like a penguin, hold up, bitch, we got it A1
Ah, I got the sauce
I got the whip and I feel like a boss, bang on your bitch then I send her back off
Woo, woo, might pull up the lot
Hunnid bands on me, looking like guap, serving the birds, we sell 'em by flocks, oh, yeah

[Hook: Caskey]
Yeah, ain't no fucking way, yeah
Ay, yeah, ain't no fucking way
I've been rolling, smoking, shooting out the roof, ain't no way
How you think I'm 'bout to lose? I'm in the coupe in LA
Ain't no way

[Verse 4: Cityboistreets]
Ain't no way
I might hop out of the whip with two bitches from LA
I've been living through the [?] especially in these Gucci shades
I've been rollin', smokin' dope, I've been trappin' every day, oh look
Fuck what you say, I just caught a play, I still got the cake on me
Them niggas, they hate, I've never been fake, I'm more like a great, homie
Had to switch it up, had to get my chicken up
And I keep the blicker, bruh, don't end up a victim, bruh
Oh, look, whoa, oh, watch how I walk
Talking 'bout dollars and no, we can't talk, young nigga popping, I came from New York
Oh, look, I had to call Cas, ooh, had to get back in my bag
Fuck what you mean, I've been wavey, no flag, gold on my chain with a Louis V rag, facts

[Hook: Cityboistreets & Caskey]
Look, ain't no way
I've been dripping with the sauce, they like, "Ain't no way"
I've been rolling, smoking dope, they like, "Ain't no way"
I've been trappin', I've been rappin', they like, "Boy, ain't no way"
Ain't no way
Yeah, ain't no fucking way, yeah
Ay, yeah, ain't no fucking way
I've been rolling, smoking, shooting out the roof, ain't no way
How you think I'm 'bout to lose? I'm in the coupe in LA
Ain't no way
