[Verse 1: Kix Carter]
Told my mama I'ma make it, and I put that on my life
Told my mama I'ma make it, two shots, now I'm right
I've been waiting on this my whole fucking life
But I think I got proof that there ain't no God
Click-click, pop, now the motherfucker ghost
Point us to the safe and you better know the code
God damn it, I'm impatient, damn it, I've been waitin'
Feel it in my soul and you can hear my body achin'
I've been waitin' on this day and I've been looking for a way
I've been prayin' to this man and I don't know his fucking name
Whoa, turn the hands on the clock back
Don't be surprised if we bust back (Why?)
'Cause I never got the chance to say goodbye to my gramps
And I think about it every single day
If I got the chance, what would I say?
I put the pistol to my head just so I can fucking cope
Man, you praying to a God like you think there's fucking hope
If you ever doubted me, crawl your head through the rope
If you hating on my team, bitch, I hope you die slow
Headed to the top and I think I see the finish

[Hook: Kix Carter]
Bitch, don't play me 'bout my fucking bidness
Kill 'em all, don't leave a witness
I think I just need more time
I'm drowning in my cup, never drowning in my problems
Told that bitch to shut up 'cause money my only option

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Yeah, I ain't praying to a God that I never met
You got bitches on your side and they never wet
Man, I'm sort of like Osirus, I never set
On the island, you never jet
Gotta suck my PJ to get a BJ
Swear they gotta do it my way or hit the highway
AKA I'm dropping bitches off in the freeway
Still here, and relaxed in a hotel suit with two freaks
And my reputation been unscuffed like new sneaks
Tell these pussies come and get an issue
[?] up a bit about the breakup but it never miss you
I'm writing letters from the hideout and selling whiteout
Coming from where it ain't safe for ya when it's night out
Coming from where when they talk about you, gotta ride out
Coming from where all the fake muhfuckers died out, slide out
And I ride with my tool, bitch motherfucker
Tried to play me like a fool, trust me, he don't want none
Got inside the coupe, and the dash say 215, but I don't run
I'm not inside a suit, no, I'm in a t-shirt say "down with the sickness"
And I killed a witness, told her, "Bitch..."

[Hook: Kix Carter]
Bitch, don't play me 'bout my fucking bidness
Kill 'em all, don't leave a witness
I think I just need more time
I'm drowning in my cup, never drowning in my problems
Told that bitch to shut up 'cause money my only option
