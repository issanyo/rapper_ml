[Chorus: $ammyC]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Smoke somethin', bitch, I'm smoking somethin' (Loud!)
All my dogs, they got the pack, you know we holding somethin'
I been holding somethin', I be smoking somethin'
I see your boys be talking, know that we ain't hearing nothin'
Nah, smoke somethin', I'm smoking somethin'
Hoe, you think you getting high? We smoking down a whole onion
Smoke somethin', I be smoking somethin' (Loud!)
Call the plug, hit the RICO, then I get to bustin' (Down!)

[Verse 1: $ammyC]
One hit of this'll have ya on the ground, yeah
We on some piff that y'all cannot pronounce
Let me slow the process down
Get a ounce, break that shit off to my town
Catch your blessings and your profit
'Cause there's casualty around
You can tell that I am lifted if you look into my eyes
So the cops made me a target, recognize me in the skies
I just pull off in my whip, rolling something for the ride
Tell her, "Baby, we be smoking till the fucking sunrise"
I'ma get it poppin', there be bodies droppin'
We just get the grind up and never stoppin'
Putting everything in we got for the profits
Smoking something loud, you know that we got it
Out here with Caskey
So now we got Cash Money fucking speakin'
Just like all the critics and posers and preachers
My team gon' stay right by my side, so I lead 'em
Just look in my rear view, see all my demons
Y'all looking defeated
Been growing this shit since I planted the seed
Now it's time to harvest the money I'm reapin'
Been working the hardest, y'all the hardest sleepin'
This summer I'm out here, adding, multiplying the numbers
I'm only subtracting the times that I'm thumbin'
The priming is comin'
Sativa all up on my mind like it's nothin' (Loud!)

[Chorus: $ammyC]
Smoke somethin', bitch, I'm smoking somethin' (Loud!)
All my dogs, they got the pack, you know we holding somethin'
I been holding somethin', I be smoking somethin'
I see your boys be talking, know that we ain't hearing nothin'
Nah, smoke somethin', I'm smoking somethin'
Hoe, you think you getting high? We smoking down a whole onion
Smoke somethin', I be smoking somethin' (Loud!)
Call the plug, hit the RICO, then I get to bustin' (Down!)

[Verse 2: Caskey]
I be hearin' all the rumors 'bout a drought and shit
We just got back from LA and swear we got the loudest shit
Heard you run the city, I came through, I kinda doubt this shit
One of my lil homies caught a body and he proud as shit
Ride throughout the scene
I could fit like 50,000 in these jeans
Used to do them type of numbers
When I trapped out Winter Springs
Back when Molly wasn't popping
Yeah, them folk was on the bean
I would scoop 'em by the thousand pack
And serve all up the scene
Fiends, then I skrrt off
Pussy boys getting popped 'fore they get a word off
In a parking lot, flexed out with my shirt off
1911 is hanging outside of the side of my jeans
We don't do it for appearance
Thousand pounds on a plane
They ain't gotta give me clearance
I just got a record deal, I don't need no interference
Forty city show tour, made more than your parents
Yeah, I'm trapping out with $ammyC (my partner)
Got the grow house looking like a canopy

[Chorus: $ammyC]
Smoke somethin', bitch, I'm smoking somethin' (Loud!)
All my dogs, they got the pack, you know we holding somethin'
I been holding somethin', I be smoking somethin'
I see your boys be talking, know that we ain't hearing nothin'
Nah, smoke somethin', I'm smoking somethin'
Hoe, you think you getting high? We smoking down a whole onion
Smoke somethin', I be smoking somethin' (Loud!)
Call the plug, hit the RICO, then I get to bustin' (Down!)
