[Hook]
Rick James, my flow, Rick Owens, my ho
Ric Flair on these bitches, I won't go, I came here to glow
Bitch, I got that Pimp C in my Styrofoam
I'm too fucked up, I ain't driving home
Ric Flair, my bitch, I'm on, I'm rich
Alexander Wang all on my crib, I'm all over this
I get whatever I put my mind on
I'm too fucked up, I ain't driving home

[Verse 1]
We roll, I pimp, I'm counting percents, girls all on me
They plotting ways to take the throne, that does not allow me
I got a Tommy, I'm coming tsunami, dripping balmy
They gon' fuck up their relationship and try to call me
They try to holler at my bitch and dap me up
But I got some intel say you actin' tough, back it up
When you workin' this hard you don't get time to relax enough
'Cept I love my work, it feel like vaca when I'm stackin' up, bih

[Hook]
I just Rick James my flow, Rick Owens, my ho
Brick off at the stove, I'm goin' to blow, I came here to glow
I got that Pimp C in my Styrofoam, yeah
I'm too fucked up to be driving home, yeah

[Verse 2]
Fifty freaky bitches just jumped in the car with me
It's a good thing 'cause the whole clique left the bar with me
They wanna smash out at the telly, that ain't hard to see
My mind been gone and I ain't even bring my heart with me
She wanna fuck me at the crib, well then give that girl the keys to the ride
Add the visol and the frappuccino lean to the side
I don't even like dessert but I'm a fiend for the pies
Once you get out of the kitchen, all your cream finna rise
She gon' hit it good and do the most to ya
Try hardest to get close to ya
Tell ya how much I deserve this shit and I as working for
That's how I boast to ya
These girls have been with the vision and I'm servin' in division
So much money coming [?], ay

[Hook]
Rick James, my flow, Rick Owens, my ho
Brick off at the stove, we like to go, I came here to go
Bitch, I get whatever I put my mind on
My pockets both got a firearm, yeah
Rick James, my bitch, distorted my wrist
Fuck it, I'm on biz, imported my kicks, I'm sure that I'm rich
I got Pimp C in my Styrofoam
She gon' get it and then drive home

[Verse 3]
Can you suck dick in the ride while I'm driving at the same time?
Can I holler at my side piece on the main line?
We ice the watches but it doesn't mean we gain time
To police, it ain't mine, they find me with drugs, "it ain't mine"
She wanna come fuck in a new ride
I told her, "It happen in due time"
I told her you pussies, you tube tied
I told 'em come get this shit two times
Why they won't fuck with the kid though?
I'm iced out, coming on a figaro

[Hook]
Rick James, my flow, Rick Owens, my ho
Just got [?] with the dough, I'm serving the blow
Bitch, I got that Pimp C in my Styrofoam
Type of fuck shit I be wild on
