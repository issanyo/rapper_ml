This is for Orlando, nigga, this is my city, ay
Smoke about a hunnid blunts, I know it might be silly, ay
Taking all the bitches, got the haters like "really," ay
Orlando is my city, nigga, Orlando is my city
This is for Orlando, nigga, this is my city
Smoke about a hunnid blunts, I know it might be silly
Taking all the bitches, got the haters like "really"
Orlando is my city, nigga, Orlando is my city

[Verse 1: Persyce]
Ay, Orlando was my city from the jump
Where niggas ride around with the pump, let it dump
And them bitches got a whole lot of bass in the trunk
In the VIP, sneaking all the weed in the club, hater
I got a little message for you players
You all could suck a dick, I hope you never get paper
Nigga, I'm the alpha and the omega
No Xbox, PS4s or Sega, player
I'm the real thing, my nigga, you a beta, we don't play no games
Riding 'round Orlando, see ya later, call me renegade
Orlando was the place where these haters all get a fade
Talking like you hard put a hard nigga in the grave
That's how it is in the O
Niggas hit the road, bring the blow to the O
Man, I be the illest motherfucker coming from the O
Niggas hate on me 'cause they already know

[Bridge: Persyce]
Orlando's my city
I'm squeezing on titties
Your hoe gon' get with me
Suck me dry like a kiwi
Tell that hoe, "Feed me, bitch"
Orlando's my city, bitch
Bitch nigga, you ain't hard, you just look mad

[Hook: Persyce]
This is for Orlando, nigga, this is my city, ay
Smoke about a hunnid blunts, I know it might be silly, ay
Taking all the bitches, got the haters like "really," ay
Orlando is my city, nigga, Orlando is my city
This is for Orlando, nigga, this is my city
Smoke about a hunnid blunts, I know it might be silly
Taking all the bitches, got the haters like "really"
Orlando is my city, nigga, Orlando is my city

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Twenty-one years, never fucked with the OPD
Seem like gotta flip them a bird every time I ride by, I got OCD
Rolling 'round to your whole CD
And I ain't hear a motherfucking word to relate to
You ever get love out of Pine Hills or the east side
That's a motherfucking breakthrough
I'm O town reppin', the city, fare white boy
Certified fact, I'm a O town legend
And you know my profession
From beating on the lunch tables, handing out lessons
Me and Persyce hit the lab back in 2010
Put in all the work with the pen
Birdman called me and suddenly, I'm worth a couple M's
Now everybody wanna make amends, motherfuckers know

[Bridge: Caskey]
O town is my city
We serving up that Whitney
Got Bobby Brown, got Reggie Bush
Got kush clouds, got sixteens
Got fo' fo's and we po' fo's
And then pull hoes in the fo' do's
Sell shit for the high price
And we cop shit for the low dough, ha
