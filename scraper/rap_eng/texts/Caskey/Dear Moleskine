[Intro]
Yo, yo, yo, check check, one, two
Some hip-hop shit, you know?
Sometimes you gotta get back to the roots
It's February 3rd in 2016
I just saw this Erykah Badu interview, it inspired the fuck out of me Yeah, I love music, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Inspired by the great ones there before me
I thank the universe for acknowledging my story
For breathing life into this capsule I call a body
It's currently is South Morocco, laughing at a party
But been touched by the gracious and most high
I'm sold to the faint familiarities most buy
The devil made me quite a offer for an estate with the flyest bitches
I declined though, my consciousness stay out on Mount Olympus
And it signed an eternity lease
Who want war with the rap god? I'm handing out infirmary seats
Yeah, my brother told me this 'bout the mind: Ain't no limits
Only plateaus and you ascend to those at yo' rap show
Then go home to fine tune with tools on your Mac Pro
So never mind if your status is Kendrick or Ab-Soul
We all the same, all got in places we can't escape from
Let the people make the decision to call you great one
Just keep yo' head humble, the jungle is full of snakes, son
And plenty lions met with the venom when tryna make fun
Ain't no substitute for work and devotion
Ain't no shortcut you could find in a potion
Quickest way to mastermind is first to master self, master emotion
And master knowledge, don't need to get yo' master from college
But it's cool though, in a world where the sacred bein' demolished
And people so infatuated with being acknowledged
What an awesome thing it is to not be acknowledged

[Outro]
Think about it
Might move out the country and disappear for a lil bit, you know?
