[Intro: Caskey]
You know what I'm saying?
It's times like these you need a mafucking joint in the studio, you know?
It's me, young Caskey, and Chad The Pilot in this bitch
We in Orlando right now, tryna put the whole team on, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Chad The Pilot]
Brand new Chali, whip it off the lot
Hot sixteen, I'ma spit it off the top
This for the ones who say I'm gon' not
Take every chance, I'ma end that shot
Pockets full of money, putting 'caine on the block
Give the game what I got and the game got me
Hooked on drugs and the fame got me
Bird's eye view with a penthouse suite
Whole damn team on Miami Beach
Driving to the dreams, my tank on E
But I'm pushin', pushin'
Blow like ten in the 305
Homies got me and they all gon' ride
Bound to pop up and we all gon' slide, so
Wanna hit a lick, but you not gon' try
Don't try me, I'm not that guy

[Hook: Chad The Pilot]
Put the whole team on, this a trap theme song
Need a Sprite to lean on, roll it 'til the weed gone
High school, dropping out, Grey Goose, po' it out
Living life and showing out, I always keep these hoes around

[Verse 2: Chad The Pilot]
Handful of spades, all suited up
Got plenty money, but I need more bucks
Might pull up to say give it up
I give no fucks
Not gon' ride, unless she suck
Got 'em like, "Damn, that boy spittin'"
Know about bars, never been to prison
Court date come, don't show up
Stack that bread, run it up
Don't throw hands, I'm bumping, bruh
Dreams come true when you done enough
Future look good, I'm coming up, coming up

[Hook: Chad The Pilot]
Put the whole team on, this a trap theme song
Need a Sprite to lean on, roll it 'til the weed gone
High school, dropping out, Grey Goose, po' it out
Living life and showing out, I always keep these hoes around

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Yeah, yeah, always see me with some hoes
Shit been cooking, but I'm not at the stove
I'm driven like a spinning Rolls
Ain't doing sports, but I'm finishing goals
And you get exposed
I'm limitless, so I'ma go get the most
You shit on your bros
I stay with my day ones, they turn into pros
Took some homies in the opposition
Rollie on me 'cause they clock is tickin'
Started this without a pot to piss in
Now there's pot growing in my partner's kitchen
Yeah, we just on the yacht with the fishscale
And truth be told, I do not fish well
But I been serving off the intel
And this forty Glock got all the big shells

[Hook: Chad The Pilot]
Put the whole team on, this a trap theme song
Need a Sprite to lean on, roll it 'til the weed gone
High school, dropping out, Grey Goose, po' it out
Living life and showing out, I always keep these hoes around
