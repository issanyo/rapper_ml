[Intro: SKYXXX]
Oh shit, oh my God
Who is this bitch with me?
That was my project
Look at her now

[Bridge: SKYXXX]
Give me yo' bitch, I'ma glow her up
Give me yo' bitch, I'ma glow her up
Give me yo' bitch, I'ma glow her up
Give me yo' bitch, I'ma glow her up
Give me yo' bitch, I'ma glow her up
Give me yo' bitch, I'ma glow her up
Give me yo' bitch, I'ma glow her up
Give me yo' bitch, ay

[Verse 1: SKYXXX]
I take yo' bitch, make her walk different
Make her talk different, make her look different
I take yo' bitch, make her suck a dick
Fuck the dick, ay, I make her think different
I take yo' bitch, what?
Turn that ho into a woman
Guarantee she gon' be coming back
She fuck with [?] niggas 'cause we boomin'
I take yo' bitch, I might glow her up
You put her down and I put her up
I put that bitch in Versace shoe
I put that bitch in some Jimmy Choo
I put that bitch in some Maison Margiela
She fuck with me 'cause she know I fuck her way better
I turn an Annie into Cinderella
Eating Bruschettas with fresh mozzarella, God damn
I take yo' bitch and I glow her up
I origami and fold her up
She keep me up like the Folgers cup
Go ahead, baby, just po' me up
Go ahead, baby, just show me somethin'
All you lil niggas better learn somethin'
All you lil niggas better learn somethin'
Pass that ho to me, nigga, ay

[Hook: SKYXXX]
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Yeah, I took yo' bitch, made her glow
I took yo' bitch on a jet, took her all 'round the globe
I took that bitch in a room
I took that bitch to some places she ain't even know
I took that bitch into Paris
She said, "Yo, Cas, I don't want this shit to perish"
I said, "All things, they gon' come and they go"
Come 'round the clique, I'ma teach you to glow
I just turned yo' girl to a freak, now she wanna fuck all day
I just took yo' girl all out West, now she wanna stay in the Bay
I put yo' girl in designer
Told her, "It's cool, but yo that shit don't make you a diamond"
Gotta find that shit inside ya
Second you do, you gon' find you a man who don't hide ya
Whoa, I just put yo' girl on game
She don't even fucking like you
Say she sick of being lied to
Keep texting her and she could come slide through
Fuck yeah, come fuck with a real one
I'll fuck ya till my dick don't function
He keep talking that shit
One of these sticks gon' bust him

[Hook: SKYXXX]
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
I take yo' bitch then I glow her up
