[Intro]
(Gun loading)
Check, check
(Gunshots)
She just gettin' by

[Verse 1]
I got no love for the man who put his hands on innocent women
I been pimpin' but I never brought harm to the timid
Y'all got a lot of nerve comin' around my city limit
You grab a bitch by her titties and bring her skinny dippin', second
She don't want to advance
Hands on her, you a goner if I ever get your address from Alana
And those commas in my response only gave you time to cool off
I was always told don't eat your food while it's hot
But then again
You move on them fools when they not payin' attention
So that next time we come in contact, no more extensions
Homie just extended clips from this nine
Just a couple anesthetic shots into your spine, help you recline
I got a cold heart for rapists and pedophiles
Pediatric assistants who get to touchin' kids while the doctors is missin'
It's like a woman who been stripped of her innocence
Guess she been strippin' to compensate, in a sense
I guess one don't constitute to the other naturally
But I knew some athletes who got raped and turned to prostitutes
What a casualty
So I have come to school the faculty
Ain't no woman alive who really wanna be what she have to be

[Hook]
She just gettin' by
They say drugs numb the pain so she gettin' high
She get around the wrong crowd but the next time he put his hands on her
She gonna hit him with the
Bow!
I gave my girlfriend a pistol
Gave my momma a pistol
Gave my sister a pistol
Told them that I pray they never gotta use it
Cause they out lookin' for a man
And that man ain't a man if he abusin'

[Verse 2]
This for all the rape victims I couldn't save
This for all the girls who got stalkers cause of they MySpace
For those who been violated
Just know that if I was God
All those motherfuckers who did this would be annihilated
Girl I got a hatred inside me for pastors who claim they godly but spend they time in seclusion
Confusin' another child with they body
That's why I know God is a myth
Seem like every time he come around we get lost in the mist
I know some sinners who wear church clothes
I know some Catholic women who some church hoes
Some pastors say we ain't even seen the worst
But yo I couldn't imagine this any worser
I wonder if the government responsible for MRSA and AIDS
And low minimum wage
They say the white devil bring the slaves
And what you might settle for today is unacceptable
I lift up every woman I ever met on a pedestal
Not saying they all deserve it
Lord knows I'm far from perfect
But I was taught a woman's soul is closest to earth
So if you put your hands on  it
Then you couldn't appreciate life and what its
Worth

[Hook]
