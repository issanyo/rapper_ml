[Verse 1: Burden]
Look, my life is a movie, baby
Thinkin' 'bout it while I'm speedin' thru the valley out in Cali
In a new Mercedes, I'll pull your lady
If she ever fuck around and pay attention, I just pop me a pill
I'ma wait, about an hour later kickin'
I've been trippin', tryna get it, now I'm tryna chill
Odds are, y'all ain't keepin' it real
Anybody don't respect, then we don't keep it copacetic, uhn
Can't lie, I straight vibe, roamin' the streets
At late night and roll, the reaper take flight
And it must be medicine, I ain't much of a gentleman
Savage in every aspect, leave no evidence
Playin' mind games, givin' migraines, need Excedrin
Goin' hard for the check, where the settlement?
Dollar signs, anything we sign, that irrelevant
Can't take me out my element, shit

[Pre-Chorus: Burden]
My life is a movie now
Things changed from a juvenile
Fake friends tryna pull me down
Need somethin' to slow me down

[Chorus: Burden]
I just mixed Sprite with the two, woo!
Tonight I might try somethin' new, woo!
Don't worry 'bout shit that I do, let me do me
Take one, my life is a movie

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Every day I'm in a movie
Bomb in 60 seconds, tell them boys to try pursue me
Comin' back like Lil Boosie
I'm workin' at the game like it my duty
TV motherfuckers don't know what they doin', sittin' sideways
My bitch get on a pill and then forget her shy ways
I fuck her 'til she weaker than two born in five days
Dancin' on the couches in the cove like it's my hideaway
They been tryna stop the kid since jump but still can't find a way
Me and Burden, we the ones to watch
It's a burden when I take the watch
Give up everything, we only comin' for the knots
Shorty give me superhead and I forget about my thoughts
We connected like the dots
Out here sonnin' rappers like my pops
All my guns real, we don't need the props
Know we out here, fuck the cops
Somebody do me like Drake did Meek
On the real, I go Quentin Tarantino with the shots, yah

[Pre-Chorus: Burden]
My life is a movie now
Things changed from a juvenile
Fake friends tryna pull me down
Need somethin' to slow me down

[Chorus: Burden]
I just mixed Sprite with the two, woo!
Tonight I might try somethin' new, woo!
Don't worry 'bout shit that I do, let me do me
Take one, my life is a movie

[Verse 3: Burden]
Yes, you could say that we smoked
'cause my dog by the crib with the basement that grow
And we so lean, pourin' Sprite up with Promethazine
And Codeine, I just mix one with the two
You was tryna get money, shouldn't have run with the crew
New money with somethin', you got nothin' to do
Cash Money, there's Caskey, they don't fuck with you, lifted
Time to show 'em that the south beat 'em different
Head knock the game into submission
Deceitful people with the mic could never share a vision
Why you always bitchin'? Actin' like a hoe
I'ma go and get it if I don't have it for the low
Then I'm goin' off script, my life is a movie
Truly I'm blessed, I ain't gotta talk shit
Look like most these rappers only posin' actors
And they not about shit

[Pre-Chorus: Burden]
My life is a movie now
Things changed from a juvenile
Fake friends tryna pull me down
Need somethin' to slow me down

[Chorus: Burden]
I just mixed Sprite with the two, woo!
Tonight I might try somethin' new, woo!
Don't worry 'bout shit that I do, let me do me
Take one, my life is a movie
