[Verse 1: Caskey]
Every night before I go to sleep, I go and pop a bean
Bitch, I turn to a fiend
I'm doing acid in my dreams
Getting money off of streams
Everything you see is not what it seems, no
Me and my crew turn to outlaws
The chopper spray, no one could out fire
You a bitch and a hoe, Mrs. Doubtfire
And I'm in the game, you just a outsider, yeah
Ay, last time I checked, man, these rappers wasn't 'bout shit
Yeah, they scrape up they change and my shit is countless
Yeah, I had that magazine on me here way before Complex
You got a Napoleon complex
They comparing us, but this not a contest
Have you coming in to trace
Got the sky turning gray, on Hennessy, no Aliz√©
Never had no time to play
But for that money, we go out the way, yeah
I'm on them Taysty beats and that my new Dr. Dre, yeah
We come to play for keeps, we in the stu and goin' cray

[Hook: OhSOL.ELEGANT]
I been thinking 'bout complexes
I been thinking 'bout Rolexs
I been thinking 'bout a new necklace
I been thinking 'bout a murdered Lexus
Jack Herer, give me lemon senses
Flossing on 'em like I was a dentist
Poke her face, I'm sabre fencin'
Money talking, boy, pay attention

[Verse 2: OhSOL.ELEGANT]
I feel like time don't last
Watch the sand inside your hourglass
Getting paper from east to west
Nevertheless, I always know I'm blessed
It's automatic, must fulfill my plans
It's acrobatics, flip a twenty to a grand
Saving lives, I'm bringing peace to them
And take away the pain when I can
All my words, are thought provokin'
So I always put 'em in the open
Got a lot of hard work and devotion
Be passionate, stay focused
I been stunting on 'em, but I'm never boastin'
Some say I'm talented, but you know this shit is golden

[Hook: OhSOL.ELEGANT]
I been thinking 'bout complexes
I been thinking 'bout Rolexs
I been thinking 'bout a new necklace
I been thinking 'bout a murdered Lexus
Jack Herer, give me lemon senses
Flossing on 'em like I was a dentist
Poke her face, I'm sabre fencin'
Money talking, boy, pay attention

[Outro: OhSOL.ELEGANT]
Motherfucker, pay attention
Hey and stop sleeping on Caskey, motherfuckers
Y'all need to fucking wake up
This man's the fucking truth
Taysty, what it do man?
You fucking killed the beat again
Yeah, OhSOL.ELEGANT
