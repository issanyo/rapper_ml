[Verse 1: Dre Fresh]
I'm tryna catch the banana boat
I'm tryna sip with some Fanta hoes
I'm tryna hit the border, run to Mexico
I run a mansion [?] stand on tippy toes
I got a French bitch who could French kiss
Imagine how she do the deep throat
Foreign bitches be the freakiest
Man, lil mama ain't never got [?]
Señorita, señorita, wear them heels, no sneakers
Pussy turn me to a creature, rip your clothes off and eat ya
If you the beauty, I beast ya
Man, you can't rent that hoe bitch, you gotta lease her
Got my toe curling up in Versace sneakers
Swear my hands in the air, screaming, "Thank you, Jesus!"
Smoking on Mary Jane, getting top from Keisha
Yeah, you fuck with me, baby, it cost ya
I'm dripping, lil mama, I'm saucy
But a young nigga hot like a target
And these diamonds on me keep me frosty
Why your bitch steady watching? She hawkin'
Why the hell I can't get this bitch off me?
Fuck her one time, the bitch steady stalkin'

[Bridge: Dre Fresh]
Damn, woo, a young nigga hot like a target
Skrrt, yeah, but these diamonds on me keep me frosty
Woo, yeah, a young nigga hot like a target
Yeah, yeah, but these diamonds on me keep me frosty

[Hook: Caskey]
Ay, I cannot keep that hoe off me
Ay, whoa, I cannot keep that shit off me
Ay, ay, run up on me, shit get costly
Man, some people wanna off me
But I can't keep that strap off me

[Verse 2: Caskey]
This shit exhaustin', forever flossin'
Beats with me like we in Boston
And I'm coming out Slauson
She busy sucking my dick, telling me that I'm awesome
Your homie talkin'
You didn't tell him what time it is, sorry, you lost him
I'm catching the pack, Randy Moss-in'
Put on your homies when you really bossin'
Catching plays, ricochets
The mail come from California on business days
Got that 1911 tucked down in my waist
Let them lil jokers come fuck with my ace
Call it like we just came from outer space
Why you in the hood looking so out of place?
Got a new wrist piece on me, it's dancing in diamonds
Shout out to Birdman, the realest one signed me
Big check, ay, run up on me with the set, hey
Ay, check, yeah, diamonds dancing on my neck, whoa
Getting played, ay, why you always tryna flex?
Money don't bring you respect, I brush my teeth with a tech

[Hook: Caskey]
Ay, I cannot keep that hoe off me
Ay, whoa, I cannot keep that shit off me
Ay, ay, run up on me, shit get costly
Man, some people wanna off me
But I can't keep that strap off me, ay

[Outro: Dre Fresh]
Yeah, I cannot keep these hoes off me
Huh, yeah, I cannot keep these hoes off me
Yeah, hey, I cannot keep these hoes off me
I cannot keep you hoes off me, I cannot keep you hoes off me
Hey, yeah, I cannot keep these hoes off me
Hey, yeah, I cannot keep the hoes off me
Hey, yeah, I cannot keep the hoes off me
I cannot keep the hoes off me, I cannot keep the hoes off me
