[Pre-Chorus: Benjah]
Every time we pull up, you can see us from the satellites
Got your buddy moving like it's turn up on a Latin night
I ain't gotta talk about it, I'm just speaking facts of life
You can do the most, but that don't mean you do it right, nah

[Chorus: Benjah]
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up

[Verse 1: Benjah]
Tryna get it for a long time, they ain't really wanna give it to me
People ask why I ain't signed, I don't need 'em you see me boomin'
Time to lace it up, we got a long way
I just choose to do it on my own
Everybody wanna party every night, hands up to the sky
You see the fire in her eyes, don't believe the lies
We chasing, running out of time, you see us roll with all of mine
You know we ride until we die, it's too heavy, thought it would be light

[Pre-Chorus: Benjah]
Every time we pull up, you can see us from the satellites
Got your buddy moving like it's turn up on a Latin night
I ain't gotta talk about it, I'm just speaking facts of life
You can do the most, but that don't mean you do it right, nah

[Chorus: Benjah]
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Weight up, weight up
I can't slow down, I can't wait up
Y'all broke so you know you gon' hate us
I ain't ever goin' on hiatus
Weight up, weight up
I work too hard, they is not gon' play us
People ain't doing nothing want gossip
Shit's sweet and it's not gon' pay us
I am tryna get a check
Tryna rise above the hate, put a piece on my neck
Manifest into who next
Gotta do more than just flex, I done put my life all in it
How many times I been down to my pennies?
Riding 'round with a whole life sentence
Tryna be saint like made me a menace
Look to the sky, I don't think it's the limits
Tryna go up, tryna dodge gimmicks
Tryna use every ounce of my [?]
Tryna chill less, I'm doing more business
Adding up mo' digits
I got that weight on me, whoa, yeah
I don't need no one to wait on me
All they gon' do is just hate on me
Hate on me, tell me my weight up

[Pre-Chorus: Benjah]
Every time we pull up, you can see us from the satellites
Got your buddy moving like it's turn up on a Latin night
I ain't gotta talk about it, I'm just speaking facts of life
You can do the most, but that don't mean you do it right, nah

[Chorus: Benjah]
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up
Wodie, wodie, wodie, get your weight up
