[Hook: Nixxo]
Smoking on that gas, that's that pressure
You smoking on that trash, that's not pressure
You know I got that loud, that's that pressure
If you need a few pounds, that's no pressure
You know I run my town, yeah, there's pressure
Yeah, you know I got that loud, that's that pressure
If you need a few pounds, I got pressure

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Man, you know I hit my city up and I'm applying pressure
Price is going up on everybody, charging extra
'fore I leave the house, I grab the fo' five off the dresser
Can't fuck with these rappers baby they just tryna finesse ya
Gotta keep the heat on my waist, beat the case 'cause it's cold out
We ain't sell our soul to make the music, but we sold out
So much money coming in, we damn near fixed the whole drought
You been rapping 'bout a lot of things that you don't know 'bout

[Verse 2: Nixxo]
Moved into my mama crib then turned it to a dope house
Yeah, I'm from the K town but I'll probably serve the whole south
Yeah, it's Young Nixxo, I'm that nigga you ain't know about
Boss nigga, nah, nah, nah, I ain't seen the drought
Yeah, this straight pressure, got it for the lesser
Fuck a bitch, I never stress her, I'm just tryna run a check up
Yeah, I see you niggas hating, 'cause I'm way fresher
Got them pounds in the dresser
Mama say, "Boy, you going hard, God bless ya"

[Verse 3: Caskey]
God bless ya
'fore I be a victim, I turn into the oppressor
We comin' for the full amount and takin' nothin' lesser, yeah
We smokin' on that Keyshia, but we fuckin' on Vanessa, ay

[Hook: Nixxo & Caskey]
Smoking on that gas, that's that pressure
You smoking on that trash, that's not pressure
Smoking on that loud, that's that pressure
You say you need some pounds, that's no pressure
Man, you know I run my town, that no pressure
Yeah, you know the only thing we smoke is pressure
If it's beef, then we pull up with the pressure
Man, you know we smoking loud, that that pressure

[Verse 4: Nixxo]
Really I'm the plug, it's no pressure
My city show me love, it's no pressure
In the lab cooking up, boy, I feel like the professor
He told on his mans, man, he couldn't hold pressure
I would never fold under pressure
My neck full of gold, that's that pressure
You know I'm next to gold, that's that pressure
Better step up your flow, applying pressure
Yeah, we get it for the low, but we go and charge you extra
Yeah, we tax it

[Outro: Nixxo]
That's that pressure, that's that pressure
That's that pressure, that's that pressure
That's that pressure, that's that pressure
That's that pressure, yeah, yeah
That's that motherfucking pressure
What you know about that pressure, nigga?
