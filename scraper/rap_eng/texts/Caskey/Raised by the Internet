[Chorus]
Raised by the internet
Life: money, cars, clothes, hoes; incorrect
Yeah, eyes closed, intellect
My generation never die, it's a bet
Raised by the internet
Life: money, cars, clothes, hoes; incorrect
Ayy, eyes closed, intellect
My generation never die

[Verse 1]
My generation never die
When my bones cigarillo dry
Celebrate for my souls in vanilla sky
In the larger scheme of things, we say, "Hello, bye"
Only one shot at life, but we settle, why?
Fuck Illuminati, kick the system with my shell toes
Made my enterprise off ecstasy and elbows
New Chanel bag, overshop on Melrose
She like attention, naked pictures on her cell phones
Me? I be poppin' pills, tryin' to populate my ills
Pops lacked communicative skills, paid the bills
Left me and my momma, sister broke, I had to build
My mind the only sword that I could wield, so I killed
Any bitch ass rapper tryna show the skin and say he ill
Y'all mumble ass some bullshit, I can't understand the feel
Y'all flash a lot of weapons, you ain't go pop somethin' real
Y'all, only generation know just how it feel

[Chorus]
Raised by the internet
Life: money, cars, clothes, hoes; incorrect
Yeah, raised by the internet
My generation never die, it's a bet
Yeah, raised by the internet
Life: money, cars, clothes, hoes; incorrect
Yeah, raised by the internet
My generation never die, it's a bet

[Verse 2]
Momma sing me lullabies in my native tongue, ayy ayy
A hunnid forty characters of love, ayy ayy
Slide into my DMs like a tongue, ayy ayy
Snap it one more time and make me cum, ayy ayy
Now everybody say that they the plug, ayy ayy
You pull up on 'em and they out of drugs, ayy ayy
Where I'm from, everybody bloods, ayy ayy
Least that's what they say, but I can't trust it, ayy
Oh, gun inside my coupe big as a musket, ayy
Pray I don't bust it, ayy, they tryna disrupt it, ayy
They wanna catch up to me, take all of mustard, ayy
But shit, they rushed it, ayy, they way too flustered, bae

[Verse 3]
I'm way too calculated, you kicked out, you hate it
Once they see you in the streets, all that sideways talk 'bout how you overrated turn to, "How you made it?"
"How you on so much drugs, not sedated?"
"You still fuck with Baby? Ain't that shit with him and Lil Wayne crazy?
He gon' pay you, dog, for your rhymin' skills?"
"Ain't you sittin' inside that Panamera Forgiatos, dog? How that feel?"
"You see Nicki ass in person? I don't know if that shit real"
"I just Googled your net worth, it say you worth a hunnid mill"
"I just clocked out of my nine-to-five, I got a drug to deal
I'ma be as famous as you when I make it out of here"
Out the stratosphere where my thoughts intersect
Just a bunch of young motherfuckers, raised by the internet

[Chorus]
Raised by the internet
Life: money, cars, clothes, hoes; incorrect
Raised by the internet
My generation never die, it's a bet
Raised by the internet
Life: money, cars, clothes, hoes; incorrect
Raised by the internet
My generation never die, it's a bet
