[Verse 1]
I try to tell 'em I ain't blind, swear I don't ever be surprised
In these times, I just be relieved that we survived
I advise you to never enter in disguise
This a open field, you ain't gotta hide
And boy, this isn't Cloverfield, you ain't gon' die
I know I keep it a hunnid, yo, but this could be a lie
How the hell you gon' side with religion? Live a different decision
Do exactly as I, tell everyone you a Christian
I be wishing for some change, but the same be approachin'
Just relax, taking hits of the potent, bring the motion back
Tryna stay afloat, where the ocean at?
See a lot of sharks in the body, believe I'm scoping that
I just sip the potion like it's nothing but water
Used to have a girl who cheated on me, shit ain't make me nothing but smarter
Shit get harder, I noticed, make it harder to focus
But I feel it, 'cause that's just how it is, I'm the realest and, uh

[Hook]
Only the realest realize the realest
Yeah, only the realest
Only the realest realize the realest
Yeah, yeah
I just get laid back, if you can't feel this
Then you probably ain't real, this one here for the realest
For the realest, said this one here for the realest
For the realest, said this one here for the realest

[Verse 2]
Look, listen, I ain't blind, I see how this thang goes
Different living, but we with the same hoes
On a different mission, but we in the same clothes
In search of similar figures, so we get the same dough
Lane to lane throws, pill bottle variety
'posed to be a sober, but ain't closer to sobriety
Devil he desire me, nappy headed dreads tryin' to fire me
And I ain't working nine fives, they wanna retire me
The irony of being so cold where the fire be
You don't tell the truth? Then your soul where a lie'll be
And you pay a toll to society
Still ain't found the one I'm looking for, I was sold to variety
Hire me, I'll show you how roads of desire be
I don't know the reason why this gold so inspire me to kill it
And I ain't got no form to conceal it, I'm the illest
And that's just how it is, I'm the realest and, uh

[Hook]
Only the realest realize the realest
Yeah, only the realest
Only the realest realize the realest
Yeah, yeah
I just get laid back, if you can't feel this
Then you probably ain't real, this one here for the realest
For the realest, said this one here for the realest
For the realest, said this one here for the realest

[Verse 3]
Look, I said it, I ain't blind, I know I ain't living life perfect
And I probably spent too much time talking with serpents
I was working my ass off, hit the asphalt
The conversation turned sour, that's when I blast off
First, it's a curse to be on this earth, it wasn't at all
I pass the herb 'round, there's nothing but a notion to stall
What is waiting for me
I know that death around the corner and it's patient for me
My momma tell me go to church, she always sit in choir 'cause she praying for me
And I ain't spoke to Him in years, what she saying for me?
I hope she tell Him that I'm sorry for this Satan on me
Tryna get him off like I'm tryna get this hatin' off me
Same time, I be riding for this paper on me
See a lot of foes, not a soul that'd take it off me
'less they break it off me, and I ain't going down easy
Best believe me, I'm the motherfucking realest, bitch
