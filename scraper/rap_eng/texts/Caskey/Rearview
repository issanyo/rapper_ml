[Intro]
Gotta look at the mirror inside
Gotta look at the mirror inside
Gotta look at the mirror inside

[Verse 1]
My conscience callin' crazy, my flaws often weigh me
I'm overseas, I'm on TV, I feel like Carson Daly
That drama taught me patience
People so often think I off and made it, think I'm flossin' daily
I hope my copin' skills I ain't often wastin', time precious
Perseveration put me through the pressure out here, preperation
Shine like the sun, just waitin', it's done, stay with a gun
Your fifteen minutes come, just take it and run
They only see the way you put it out, don't see when it come
Tune in when you goin' south, don't even care 'bout your run
Let that bad shit come out they mouth 'bout you, see ya, it's done
I'm tryna wrap my head around it, knowin' there's more to come

[Chorus]
It got me lookin' out the rearview
Yeah, out the window
In my own mind, lost in the indo
When it's go time, find big potential
Tryna bend, but I'm lost in the limbo
Look out the rearview, textin' my own thoughts
Time, it waits for no man, then the show stops
Gotta look at the mirror inside you
Once you face your sins, they're behind you
In the rearview
Lookin' through the rearview
Got it in the rearview
Lookin' through the rearview

[Verse 2]
They gettin' sour 'bout me gettin' cash, lemonhead
I left my past, man, it's dead
My daddy shot himself and my heart broke
Doubt I'll ever be rich again
My skin is thick, my swisher thin
Always felt like I was fit to win
The victory go away quicker than
It took you to get the shit to begin, ironic
I disappear in the chronic
I'm tryna make everything I do iconic
I made it out of the line up
They wanted me dead, they wanted me broke
They wanted me out of designer
But I beat the odds, I give my peace to the gods
They tryna go to the moon
But I want a piece of the stars
They wanna all be in charge, hey
I wanna be free of the scars
I wanna see the places on the postcards
Man, fuck all that Goyard
Only thing you can do is to go hard
We feed the ego, let the soul starve
Drownin' in it, call it coast guard

[Chorus]
I be lookin' out the rearview
Yeah, out the window
In my own mind, lost in the Indo
When it's go time, find big potential
Tryna bend, but I'm lost in the limbo
Look out the rearview, textin' my own thoughts
Time, it waits for no man, then the show stops
Gotta look at the mirror inside you
Once you face your sins, they're behind you
In the rearview
Lookin' through the rearview
Got it in the rearview
Lookin' through the rearview
