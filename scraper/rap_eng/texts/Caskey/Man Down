[Intro: Mav]
Man down
That's a man down
Another man down

[Pre-Hook: Mav]
Rolling through the city and I'm lowkey
That's the way it go, I swear when everybody know me
Talking 'bout the heat, then you know I got it on me
Thinking that it's sweet, I guarantee it's gon' be

[Hook: Mav]
A man down, man down
It's another 'nother man down, man down
It's another one, a man down, man down
It's another 'nother man down, man down
Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk

[Verse 1: Mav]
Pulling up and I got that shit
Blue face in my pocket
Bricks stashed all through the whip
That really mean I'm white whilin'
My bitch bad so she top me down
Recline my seat while I'm drivin'
Living life so fast, oh no
We will not have regret-filled coffins
I got what you want, don't run up on me quick
'Cause if you acting slick
My goons watching from the side with hammers cocked
[?] go and split your wig
Who the hell are you talking to?
I'm not the one to be playin'
Now your girl gon' call me "boo"
I fuck her with no hesitation
My city say I'm popping
That I'm busting out the frame
I be living on an island
Hit a mission in the [?]
I will not let that go
Been through the hot and cold
Now I'm sleeping with a model bitch
Who never wear no clothes
I feel like cashing in deposits
Got sick of all the walkin'
Past the houses that's full of boxes
Police watchin', neighbors jockin'
All the plotting with the posse
And always worried 'bout his colors
So it's time I fucking made it
Wack rappers proceed with caution, motherfucker

[Pre-Hook: Mav]
Rolling through the city and I'm lowkey
That's the way it go, I swear when everybody know me
Talking 'bout the heat, then you know I got it on me
Thinking that it's sweet, I guarantee it's gon' be

[Hook: Mav]
A man down, man down
It's another 'nother man down, man down
It's another one, a man down, man down
It's another 'nother man down, man down
Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk

[Verse 2: RowdyLife YP]
Fucked a nigga bitch, I fucked the bitch and I ain't text her
I ain't even bragging, I ain't even get to flexin'
KP told me do it big like a nigga born in Texas
If they take my life today then I'ma go out like a legend
Riding 'round with Mavrik like I just got back from Dallas
I be in AZ just like a mofucking cactus
Thirty on my wrist, another thirty in the mattress
I ain't even gotta flex, there's thirty thousand in the mattress
Nino got the Nina, fucked a bitch, thick girl named Tina
All them niggas hated, turned them goofies to believers
I be rolling Cubans but I fill 'em up with reefer
Talking 'bout a hookah, put the gas inside the sheesha
Pills or you be rapping, boy, I'm colder than your idol
See no competition, I swear I'm my only rival
Whoa, man down, man down
Feel like Kobe Bryant hands down, man down, bitch

[Pre-Hook: Mav]
Rolling through the city and I'm lowkey
That's the way it go, I swear when everybody know me
Talking 'bout the heat, then you know I got it on me
Thinking that it's sweet, I guarantee it's gon' be

[Hook: Mav]
A man down, man down
It's another 'nother man down, man down
It's another one, a man down, man down
It's another 'nother man down, man down
Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Shots fired, that's another man down
We go to war, don't think I ever stand down
In the city with two pretty bitches with the tan brown
Served the mayor up so loud, I think I run the damn town
Okay, I'm peacin', that mean that I don't leave out the house
Without two pieces, people hate ya when ya start to shine
It's like my thesis, so many leeches, I feel like Jesus
All my followers some really, really sinful creatures
And I got the pounds for twenty-five, we call 'em features
Tried to take the sack, I got the blood all on my sneakers
Quite disturbed, hate on me, them fighting words
I pull up on these pussies, make 'em bite the curb, yeah
But I'm still a trippy hippy told my bitch to light the herb man
I called up Birdman, skrrt off in Suburban
Say you from the hood but all your crib look so suburban
If it's beef, we on your head just like a turban
Hey, lil bitch
