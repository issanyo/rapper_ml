[Verse 1: Caskey]
Yeah, this game, it'll change people
It turn the more familiar faces to strange people
They do the math on how much your chains equal
Think of robbing you and reconsider, recognize that yo' gang lethal
I seen my own brother turn from family to foe
Feds watching me, but I live off of Anarchy Road
My brother trapped that quarter key off the stove
In my town they try to corner me, but I done navigated the globe

[Bridge 1: Caskey]
Infatuated with activation, I dodge the accusations
My flaws evacuatin', my dog, is that you hatin'?
No, gotta keep your composure
I done witnessed great change like I worked for Jehovah
Rappers tend to unfold in defeat when the pressure induced
Start reverting to they comfort zone, they better recluse
I'd rather put my head straight thru a noose than compromise
The key to success is optimize, gotta keep composure

[Verse 2: DJ Omoney]
Need to explain, my baby, changing the wheel
It's side to side you haven't seen inside of somethin' that's real
I rock a box with a sturdy diesel, got a MasterCard and a Visa
My art is like Mona Lisa, so hard that I lost my keister
With love from my friends and support from a lot of people
We wouldn't have made it, we feed each other, we all are equal
Not me to head chains, I didn't change for the dollar
I heard that time equals money and money hired my hour

[Bridge 2: DJ Omoney]
I'm thinking Caskey was right, what I had sent him was off
Pain done broken down the beat, I'm glad the swisher was soft
I bit off more than I can chew, express my stress to the wrong
And if you heard this verse before, it's like a new fucking song

[Verse 3: DJ Omoney]
A deep and dark, aggressive man until I sat down and wrote it
I'm contradicting with my thoughts, euphoric, mind of a poet
I put myself into war for it [?] yeah I'm [?] for it
Put the cuffs on my wrist, made me go anthropomorphic
And if you miss what's important because you missing informants
I make a mission of my daddy, be the rise of my [?]
An unbelievable clout, unique, can't match my performance
I let it leak out my mouth, [?] from performance
And change the focus of the sound, I'm actually nothing to notice
All the poise that I have, was my decision to focus
Compose composure, compromise it, just [?]
Put some respect on my name to see the back of my truck
