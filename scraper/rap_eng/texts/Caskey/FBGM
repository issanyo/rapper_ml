[Intro]
Here's how it goes, everyone got their own way of telling it but uh shit
Fuck bitches and get money
That's what'cha saying when you ain't fuckin' bitches with money
Okay, be like this

[Verse 1]
Look every girl that say she ain't about that drama, really about that drama
She tell ya size don't matter
But she scream for the anaconda
I'm leaned up off the Aunt Jemima
My Aunt Jemima behind her
Mortgage payment and her basement stay full of designer
And i find it a little hard to understand
Got a couple grand worth of purses
But personally she ain't got shit
She find men to buy her items
And tell em they not chicks
I find em, I'ma fight em
And tell em they not shit
She an opportunist, I'm a Buddhist
She the white Judas
Told myself, i'd never wife a girl that like to do this
Told myself i'd never like a girl who got her principals
But the intercourse will have you second guessin' that
Grab shit in the mall, she capture it all
If it don't catch reaction at all, she don't like it at all
Tell 'em my girl license to ball
'til credit card cancellation
Now they bustin' a fit
So i found a girl with some money to suck my dick, biatch

[Chorus]
Fuck bitches and get money
That's what'cha say when you ain't fuckin' bitches with money
Alright, i like girls who got they own bank
And they own drank and know what to think
They always be like, "aye, fuck bitches and get money"
That's what you say when you ain't fuckin' bitches with money
Alright, find a girl who got a job and ambition
Not a girl who just another product of these bitches, homie

[Verse 2]
Look every girl who say she don't want'cha commas
Really want'cha commas
Our conversations seem to revolve me and dollars
She hate that we only down at Carrabba's
She like [?] or something
Don't even know how to pronounce it
Cop me an ounce instead
Why you always find a girl that like to count yo bread
Cause after countin' come the head
And man the head astoundin'
Some rappers around my way will pay for the pussy
But they pussy, look me in both of my eyes
You can see that nookie was for free doe
Girls they like the guys playing heroes
With a number on they jersey or dirty money with zeros
I used to have this homie's pockets swole
Til these hoes convinced him that the gold he had wasn't gold
Thats a cold symbolic way of telling it
Picture me paying for some pussy
Use to be selling it, celibate, boy i think not
Something phallic about her analyze of the ink blot
And i think i'm about to give her mine to think about
I heard she get paid like a mother fuck'a

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Man you a suck'a ho, suck a ho
Type to cuff you a ho
Type to pay for the suck and blow with a couple hundred O's
Fella's i be seeing lately they disgust me
Ever see me pay for attention i pray you bust me
Cuss me out, pull the Puffy out of your inner being
Let the beginners leave the scene and quit the intervening
Man these rapper schemin
A gold digger sorta like a demon
Except demons pay for they own and they got it
These women fiendin' they pockets depleting
Shit, i don't love em
Lately i been changing my ways
And don't even fuck em
Cause shit they get attached to the hip
See you with a bag of chips
Think that's gonna be theirs
Then i'm gonna snatch yo wrist
You touch my shit
Like get'cho own
Ain't got a number better get'cho phone
Maybe if it is convenient then i can get'cho stoned
Second that you wanna get this bone
Then i'ma ask ya about yo pockets
And you gonna ask me about a loan, ha damn

[Chorus]
