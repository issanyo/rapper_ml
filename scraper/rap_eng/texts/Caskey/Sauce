[Hook]
Yeah, yeah, I got the sauce on me
I told my partners I'ma be there when they call for me
I told my bitch to get the bag and give it all to me
I told 'em, "I can't never let this fame misalter me"
I'm back swerving through the city
Got the sauce on me, sauce on me, yeah
Yeah, I got the sauce on me, sauce on me, yeah
Yeah, I got the sauce on me, sauce on me, yeah
Yeah, I got the sauce on me, sauce on me, yeah

[Verse 1]
What the fuck do these pussies take me for?
Hit me for a sack, I had to go and get some more
I ain't been on the scene, I took the scenic route for tour
I just hit the strip club, we threw them dollars on the floor
I'ma be a boss in a minute
You gon' be a manager at Ross when you finished
I might come through and cop a couple cloths for the gimmicks
You work in business but I'm 'bout the business
I couldn't start this shit and never finish
I done pulled up and I got to spend it
Told all my brothers we finna get it
I feel like all of these rappers are gimmicks
But I don't do none of this shit for the image, nah

I just fucked so much bad bitches, it's exhaustin' me

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah, I got the sauce on me
I told my partners I'ma be there when they call for me
I told my bitch to get the bag and give it all to me
I told 'em, "I can't never let this fame misalter me"
I'm back swerving through the city
Got the sauce on me, sauce on me, yeah

Yeah, I got the sauce on me, sauce on me, yeah

[Verse 2]
What the fuck do these pussies take me for?
I just might come up and steal your whore
I just got addicted, getting more
Yeah, I pull up stunting daily, it's a motherfucking chore
Don't you love it when your ex call and you gettin' sucked?
Or when you a bitch and you gettin' fucked
When you're 23, gotta live it up
You the type of person told me get it

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah, I got the sauce on me
I told my partners I'ma be there when they call for me
I told my bitch to get the bag and give it all to me
I told 'em, "I can't never let this fame misalter me"
I'm back swerving through the city
Got the sauce on me, sauce on me, yeah
Yeah, I got the sauce on me, sauce on me, yeah
