[Chorus]
I ain't trying to lose myself to this famous shit
I be on one, thinking 'bout how I really need to change my shit
Look around, everything so shallow
Waking up every day is a battle
Make anybody wanna throw the towel

[Verse 1]
Yeah, not me, looking in the mirror, I see
The man right in front of me say, "I got I-T"
They trying to stop the wave, I'm riding, tell 'em "godspeed"
You know the time
You know that all that talk and shit made me work overtime
They wait for it to happen, me, I had to go get mine
I swear my work ethic insane and I overgrind
So when they hating on my accolades, I never mind
People talk shit 'cause it's way too easy
It's much harder to apply yourself and try to beat me
Yeah, so I never ever base my happiness on the comments
I'm just working on myself, going harder like I promised
When your fuse getting low
When you're smoking so much and you escape with the dro
When you're spending every night inside a different liquor sto'
When you're driving on the highway drunk, and you know
That you know better, that you know, yeah
That you know better, yeah, that you know
That you can't escape the places in your mind that you go

[Chorus]
I ain't trying to lose myself to this famous shit
I be on one, thinking 'bout how I really need to change my shit
Seem like all these people so shallow
Every day, waking up is a battle
Make anybody wanna throw the towel

[Verse 2]
People talk about my life who don't know me
I'ma ball on 'em, leave my legacy and dip like Kobe (swish)
If you're tryna hold me down, then don't say it, gotta show me
When you starting to get success, everything gets lonely
Yeah, can you relate? Not another second I could waste
Some people misinform, thinking that it's only fate
It's more about the way you cooking than what's on the plate
In my momma crib on the day I lost my pops
Now every day I live, trying to get the bigger knots
Sometime I be just wondering if shit is really worth it
Most people I know crumbling right underneath the surface
Still give my blood, sweat and tears, I was broke for some years
I was caught up on them Percs, I done buried some my peers
I done spent a lot of nights in a room with my fears
I been caught up in depression, I was blaming my career
But I know better, yeah, I know better, yeah, but you know
That you can't escape the places in your mind that you go

[Chorus]
And I ain't trying to lose myself to this famous shit
I be fucked up, shorty, thinkin' how I really need to change my shit
Oh, look around everything so shallow
Waking up everyday is a battle
Sometimes feel like throwing in the towel
But you know you know better
Yeah, you know you know better, yeah, you know
That you know you know better
Yeah, you know you know better, yeah, you know
Sometimes feel like throwing in the towel
Sometimes feel like all of ya'll shallow
Sometimes feel like my heart hollow

[Interlude: Jim Carrey]
I've often said that I wish people could realize all their dreams and wealth and fame, so they could see that it's not where you're gonna find your sense of completion

[Verse 3]
Uh, my accolades are spinning 'round me
The day my father passed away, the day that music found me
It's crazy how my darkest times the ones that have allowed me
To free my heart and soul and clear the chains that really bound me
I use it as a lesson that everything is for reason, though that reason ain't always clear
I'm searching for meanings in my quiet time
Conscious hours, focused on breathin'
I just sold a 'script of Oxycontin to someone demons, I think I'm crazy
Think I'm spending time in the clubs and they need to play me
Think I'm fucking up on the scenes that I need to vacate
Wait, there I go with that swag flow again
The same shit that made some fans call me sell-out 'cause shit ain't dope to them
Don't think they understand artistry is 'bout openin'
Your mind to different waves of experiments and I'm soakin' in
All things subject to change
Just don't talk about me like my life purpose was in vain
Like I don't apply the pressure to these hoes in the game
My creativity at higher levels than what I claim
Know the path to greatness is through humility
Will it be my intelligent ways, verses strength and agility
They'll fuck the world and let 'em die verse vulnerability
Know that God put me here because I got the will in me
No, my purpose here is more than just music
It's 'bout self improvement, this year I'm blowing up
And having major influence in this shallow fucking rap game

[Outro: Jim Carrey]
My soul is not contained, within limits of my body
My body is contained within the limitlessness of my soul
One unified field
One unified field of nothing, dancing for no particular reason
