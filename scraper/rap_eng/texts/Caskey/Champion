[Verse 1]
Look it's been one of those nights
Cold but i'm taking in light
So dark, my Jamaican is bright
Fire burn as the tires turn
Tell the truth, that's what a liar learn
One snake can infiltrate yo entire firm
But not mine
There's rules to the plot line
Keep yo grip tight
Slip up and drop mine
That may not be worse than them hard times
And it time that i work with the force like i'm a Jedi
Could bet i, never be fake
Always a red eye, heavily caked
Baked from a couple hits of the grape
Toast another to my father
Tell 'em i'm be straight
Manufacturing wallets cause these dollars i gotta make
And i stay with a lot of things
Got unanimous connects, keep a lot of beans
Aye, and keep pushin' we a hockey team
Iced out champions with a rocky theme
Get it with a rocky theme
Asshole motherfuckers on the cocky scheme
Ah shit we a hockey team
Feelin' like champions

[Chorus]
So at one with the road
I see a lot of enemies when i road by
But my energy so live
It's the opposite of ambien, i swear
I call it feelin' like a champion
It's like the opposite of ambien
I call it feelin' like a champion

[Verse 2]
So at one with the road
I see a lot of enemies when i road by
But my energy so live
Plus i keep the fo'five
Ya i'm back on that ass
Mad visuals, summer spend a lot of my cash
Mad residuals, pockets still stuck on blast
Couldn't do nothing but make mine crossing state lines
Like a rumor in a grapevine
Just for some weight
I'm losing my fucking brain
Feel like i'm huffin' paint, puffin' dank
I'm right but something ain't
Junior, cause my father the senior
Got rumors about movements i be making
Cause i hardly den managed it all
Just, just so unorthodox
And potentially wanted by all sort of cops
But i swear i keep my corner locked
Ya that's corner of my city
I ain't on the block
I just roll around corner stop
Blow it by the O
Tell my shorty roll the quarter quiet
Haters saying that i'm sorta hot
But i'm scorchin'
Bitch i want it all, you want portions
Gold diggin' bitches end up divorcing
An orphan attention left without an endorsement
I want the love and the fortune
But sometimes having both only make the love like extortion
Ya that's why i stay morphin'
Changed to the ways of the game and changed forces
And i pop two ambien
Wide awake still feelin' like a champion

[Chorus]
