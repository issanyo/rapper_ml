[Intro]
Phone conversation between Caskey and his friend
Who explains a extraterrestrial sighting

[Chorus]
Ya my homie saw a U.F.O
Ya, it make you wonder if the government is true
Shit, my homie saw a U.F.O
End times on the rise
What the fuck is we to do
I've been thinking about the lights, codes, the flights, the roads
That you can't travel down cause they home to something unknown
(Area 51 is real, tell me how that make you feel)
We barely know anything about it

[Verse 1]
Lights, camera inside a Panamera
Luxury extraterrestrial missions
We try'na find 'em
We pay our respect to religion but we don't mind 'em
Know about the Anunnaki and describe 'em like
Angels of another world, peace minded
Watch video one time, re-winded
Then repeat the cycle
There's something about the lights in the sky
Something about the patterns in which they fly
Open your eyes
You got three of them
You really think we alone (no)
You really think that the universe is simply what is known
I done seen the stone carvings in my lone apartment
Episodes of ancient aliens and gold compartments
With old Sumerian text inside, pressure applied
Why every sightin' got to be secret
Whats with the lies and deception
I swear a photograph is so refreshing
It just means less folk can deny the message

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Something just ain't right
Paranoia got me schizo
My cousin say he witness this abduction out in Bithlo
And I bet nobody gone even discuss it
Man this shit so hard to understand
We are in a limbo
Signalling to the stars for help
I never seen me a comet
Criminals with cigars in hand
I never could leave this chronic
Honestly, take no astrophysicists to see there's witnesses of flying saucers
Man if they was flying by the alter would you still be prayin'
Laying low inside yo' temple
Contact with another world is oh so quintessential
So stencil the lines
Be gentle with the signs of changes
Embrace the angels that fly with iron wings
Nova Scotia, expedition roller coaster
Hydraulic systems so advanced that our culture couldn't replicate the shit
If that don't freak you out, it freak me out
Cause i was wondering what that could be about

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Who the fuck told ya about the incidents in Roswell
Somebody who done mixed too many hits inside they cocktail
I heard about the sightings up in Scottsdale
Cause nothing happens 'round this way

[Verse 3]
We just don't believe that shit
There was surveillance balloons well then let me see that shit
Secret society we don't trust ya
Catch ya out at any event then i might rush ya
Cut out all of the subliminals
Quit turnin' decent human beings into cold criminals
And givin' us the minimal
About to transform into a general and innovate
Unidentified over the interstate
Who can explain
Who ain't prepared for change
Who is maneuverin'
The plane, wait
That ain't no plane
That look like something strange
See the wings, see the lights
Man it's aimed at us, Jesus Christ
