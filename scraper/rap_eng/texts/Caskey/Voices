[Verse 1: Eroc HistoryMakerz]
You lonely out here, can't you tell now?
The demons everywhere, can you hear 'em howl?
We fear everything, that's how we live now
The voices in our head like, "come with us now"
These niggas don't understand shit
Until they wake up in a coffin (Let me out of here, come on)
And it's no going back to your kids (Yo, I wanna kiss you one more time, man, please)
And you kiss 'em on the forehead, tell 'em you ain't coming back, shit

[Chorus: Madicin]
Life is what you make it
So before I'm dead and gone, I'll give it my all
All these other niggas fakin'
So before I'm dead and gone, gonna give it my all

[Verse 2: Eroc HistoryMakerz]
Some people say that you dreaming, I say you gone on the other side
But can't nobody answer the question, "why?"
We see our niggas that's dead and gone when we sleep
Somebody wake me up, I must be really dreamin'
I saw my nephew, AJ, he always told me (Listen unc)
Shit, you'll see how real it is when your number called
And it's no going back to your kids (Yo, I wanna kiss you one more time, man, please)
And you kiss 'em on the forehead, tell 'em you ain't coming back, shit

[Chorus: Madicin]
Life is what you make it
So before I'm dead and gone, I'll give it my all
All these other niggas fakin'
So before I'm dead and gone, gonna give it my all

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Yeah, I po' a fo' in a Sprite
My older sis served codeine, I always know what it's like
Man, that's just life, and it's more than rolling up dice
It's calculated, it's well thought out, this me mixed with my vice
Man, I want ice, my homie shot at a cop, got nine years paying that price
Pray that he find God locked in that cell, under those lights
Pray that I find peace holding these mics
How you get to the pinnacle if you always fearful of heights?

[Chorus: Madicin]
Life is what you make it
So before I'm dead and gone, I'll give it my all
All these other niggas fakin'
So before I'm dead and gone, gonna give it my all
