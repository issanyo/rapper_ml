[Chorus]
Yeah, two girls at the same time
Please don't hit my main line
Grindin', I work overtime, work overtime
On drugs, but I'm focused like a sober mind

[Post-Chorus]
Only want the check, only want the check
Only want the check, only want the check
Jewelry on my wrist like I'm on a pirate ship
Ain't do this alone, product of environment

[Verse]
Okay, I only want the check, shawty wanna give me neck
But I'm only into that if it's inside of the vet
Or I take off in the jet, tryna cross some continents
Sounds right that I'm gettin' checks, but that's just some common sense
Man, I work harder than you suckers, out here ballin'
I took your hoe from 'round ya 'cause I'm crawlin'
Yeah, two girls freak alone, in the coupe with me
Drugs inside the car, but that's usually
I'm clutchin' on my MAC-10, I whip, wrist relaxin'
I'm in, main attraction, I never do subtraction
Tryna add it, add it, add it up (add it up)
Look at ya, know you mad as, mad as fuck, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
'cause I, I got two girls at the same time
Please don't hit my main line
Grindin', I work overtime, work overtime
On drugs, but I'm focused like a sober mind

[Post-Chorus]
Only want the check, only want the check
Only want the check, only want the check
Jewelry on my wrist like I'm on a pirate ship
Ain't do this alone, product of environment

[Bridge]
Only want the check, only want the check
Shawty pop that pussy for me 'cause she know I'm next
Wasn't there when I was broke and that's what she forgets
But I still remember, so I take off with the rest
Only want the check, she only want the check
She only want the check, she only want the check
Shawty pop that pussy for me 'cause she know I'm next
Wasn't there when I was broke and that's what she forgets

[Outro]
Only want the check
Only want the check
Only want the check, only want the check
Only want the check, only want the check
Only want the check
Only want the check, yeah
Only want the check, only want the check, oh God
Only want the check, only want the check, yea
