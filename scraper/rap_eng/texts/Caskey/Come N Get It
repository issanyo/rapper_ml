[Verse 1]
Fuck religion, you a goddess, can I praise you for a second?
Pay my tithes to you 'cause you my biggest blessin' lil' mama
I'm locked inside a confession
Taking shots, you done left a banging impression
I'm impressed, I want you on my team
They don’t know how to handle your body
They’ve never seen something like yours
Im gripping your ass, opening doors
You like to growl, I'm a lion, I like to roar
Look I simplified it
Jumped in and ride it, legs get divided
I'm slipping and slidin'
Your pussy might have came with Poseidon, God damn
Come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it
Look girl, you call up, I'm gon' make time
Don’t care how far you are, for you, I'm crossing state lines
That’s from my mouth you ain't gotta go check the grape vine
Come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it

[Hook]
Ok, I seen you from afar
Pulled up in the car
Dropped the top quick
Girl, I'm cool with who you are
Baby girl, just come and get it
Just come and get it

[Post-Hook]
She say she wanna fuck a star
Come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it
She say she wanna fuck a star
Come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it
She say she wanna fuck a star

[Verse 2]
Years later, you hold it down thorough
We overseas blowing through Euros
Pop the merlot, hit the clutch, roll through the borough
Most our communication ain't verbal but you know me well
Look I might smoke a blunt with you but that my only L
We undefeated, they just uncompeted
I ain't got the time for these pussies tweetin'
They don’t know the half of the shit we dreamin'
Exercisin', you expertizin', your body vibrant
My undivided attention on you, what you providin'? God damn
Come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it
Look it took time but we do evolve
Our issues rarely arise and they soon dissolve
I could look you in your eyes, say “I love your flaws”
Come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it

[Hook]
Ok, I seen you from afar
Pulled up in the car
Dropped the top quick
Girl, I'm cool with who you are
Baby girl, just come and get it
Just come and get it

[Post-Hook]
She say she wanna fuck a star
Come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it
She say she wanna fuck a star
Come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it

[Bridge]
She way she wanna fuck a star, somebody bizarre
I done took my sins, rolled 'em all in my cigar
Baby girl, just put it on me
She tryna put it on me
She way she wanna fuck a star, somebody bizarre
I done took my sins, rolled 'em all in my cigar
Baby girl, just put it on me
She tryna put it on me

[Hook]
Ok, I seen you from afar
Pulled up in the car
Dropped the top quick
Girl, I'm cool with who you are
Baby girl, just come and get it
Just come and get it

[Post-Hook]
She say she wanna fuck a star
Come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it
She say she wanna fuck a star
Come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it, come 'n' get it
