[Hook]
Come alive
I just mixed up something over ice
I start to feel like this could be the night
I just popped a seal and came alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
I just mixed up something over ice
Yeah, I start to feel like this could be the night
I just popped a seal and came alive, yeah

[Verse 1]
Y'all look so deprived
I been drinking way too much to drive
Yeah, I'm back, never sober
I showed 'em love and some people tried fucking me over
So then I hopped out of the rover
The summer getting hotter, my shit getting colder, damn
Just hopped out of the lamb
With a bad bitch with a tan, God damn
Just got 16 zips and I'm gon' get lit with the fam, God damn
You so alone, you ain't private yet
I just hopped out of the private jet
I ain't even make all of my commas yet
Stand on the couch saying, "I'm the shit"
Come alive
I spent so much down time getting high
I can't trust no one, they telling lies
Told her, "Come with me, teach you to fly," oh

[Hook]
Come alive
I just mixed up something over ice
I start to feel like this could be the night
I just popped a seal and came alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
I just mixed up something over ice
Yeah, I start to feel like this could be the night
I just popped a seal and came alive

[Verse 2]
I just went popped me a Molly
Harley's, we don't do Bugatti's
That body turn to tsunami
I smoke the gas in the lobby, damn
Just went and popped me a seal
Fuck then fuck, how'd it feel? God damn
Just pulled off somethin' trill
And I'm waiting my turn like wheels, God damn
Mixed up the dough with the powder
I skipped the whole hustle, I go for the power
Told her, "The whole world is ours"
I bend my bitch over inside of the shower
Still go inside of the trap house
That's where we made all the cash out
First one inside and the last out
They pass me the blunt and I pass out
Come alive
Don't be scared to come and catch the vibe
We smoke all the gas
Got an endless supply, whoa, endless supply

[Hook]
Come alive
I just mixed up something over ice
I start to feel like this could be the night
I just popped a seal and came alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
I just mixed up something over ice
I start to feel like this could be the night
I just popped a seal and came alive
Come alive
