[Intro: Pharaoh Fresh]
They only fuck with you when you dead
2Pac, it's no biggie
Whitney Houston, we got a problem
Prince, Michael Jackson
Nigga, let's go

[Hook: Pharaoh Fresh]
I'm the king of them keys, feel like Prince, homie
I feel like I'm Lucious Lyon when I prance on 'em (My Empire)
I po' up the purple rain when I'm in France, homie (I'm in Pari)
I'm down to die, when doves cry
I'm the king of them keys, feel like Prince, homie
I feel like I'm Lucious Lyon when I prance on 'em (Rar)
I po' up that purple rain when I'm in France, homie
He down to die, when doves cry, when doves cry

[Verse 1: Pharaoh Fresh]
Malcolm X mixed with Martin Luther King
Trump bringing nightmares, Bernie see the dream
Hilary Clinton lie 'bout any, everything
Crip and Blood like Isis, taking everything
I been playing chess, niggas switching teams
This is Suge Knight, feel like Eazy E
How you let a knight and bishop kill a king?
Ambition of a rider, thug life was my dream
Purple raining with Whitney, Houston
Already know what I mean
We like to double cup when we double dutch
With two sluts that's fucking the team
I'm with a thick chick, ass double stuffed
Building pyramids fit for a king
Feeling like 2Pac at his best show, screaming out, "Thug Life!"
Though he don't deal with broke

[Bridge: Pharaoh Fresh]
I'm sending her a four page letter
And I enclosed a riddle wish
That says that everyone's better after they've died
So we let doves cry

[Hook: Pharaoh Fresh]
I'm the king of them keys, feel like Prince, homie
I feel like I'm Lucious Lyon when I prance on 'em (My Empire)
I po' up the purple rain when I'm in France, homie (I'm in Pari)
I'm down to die, when doves cry
I'm the king of them keys, feel like Prince, homie
I feel like I'm Lucious Lyon when I prance on 'em (Rar)
I po' up that purple rain when I'm in France, homie
He down to die, when doves cry, when doves cry

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Damn, I just went and popped a Xan'
I forget a lot of things but I never forget who I am
I told them pussies I ain't rocking with 'em
'Cause you looking at a honest man
I just went and popped a Perky
Bad bitches but I'm still never thirsty
I pull up and drop the top on the Mercy
Y'all lucked out, same as every man
Seven hundred pounds, started seven grams
Michael Jackson money, feel like Neverland
Say they plan on stopping me and damn it
They done tried so fucking hard to do it, they never can
I made predictions like the weatherman
I ain't the person that you better than
You got the workout jacket like the Letterman

[Bridge: Caskey]
I feel like Prince today
I moved my Exs out the house and told my bitch to stay
When you a businessman, your Sunday still a business day
I fucked my bitch today, that pussy got me insane

[Hook: Pharaoh Fresh]
I'm the king of them keys, feel like Prince, homie
I feel like I'm Lucious Lyon when I prance on 'em (My Empire)
I po' up the purple rain when I'm in France, homie (I'm in Pari)
I'm down to die, when doves cry
I'm the king of them keys, feel like Prince, homie
I feel like I'm Lucious Lyon when I prance on 'em (Rar)
I po' up that purple rain when I'm in France, homie
He down to die, when doves cry, when doves cry
