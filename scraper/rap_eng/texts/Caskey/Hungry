[Chorus: Young Swiffa]
I've been so hungry
Hungry for the cash
I've been too hungry
Yeah, hungry for the cash
They don't wanna see me
Unless it's broke and on my ass
I won't let 'em fool me
They won't take me for my last
Let's get to talkin' 'bout the cash

[Verse 1: Young Swiffa]
Yeah, I said they don't wanna see me
Livin' my life designer, steppin' out in Buscemi
Or diamonds that's water, water like bottles of some Fiji
The way they be talkin' 'bout me, you'd swear they wanna be me
We changin' the channels on niggas like they watchin' TV
It was [?] and [?] boy now it's Fendi and Armani
In back, I golden my teeth so now every convo's money
Ain't seen a bag big enough yet to make me feel somfy

[Chorus: Young Swiffa]
I've been so hungry
Hungry for the cash
I've been too hungry
Yeah, hungry for the cash
They don't wanna see me
Unless it's broke and on my ass
I won't let 'em fool me
They won't take me for my last
Let's get to talkin' 'bout the cash

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Ayy, shorty want a sip 'cause all of my diamonds Fiji
I'm inside of the cut, I'm drunk, I'm twistin' seaweed
The S on my chest like what come right after the VV
I'm drunk, I'm high, I'm known from LA to DC
Look at me, my life wasn't easy, chain on like Jeezy
I'm 'bout to smoke with RiRi, you twist your head tryna be me
Gotta pay the driver 'cause I got meetings and shit's convenient
And the first time that I touched me a million, realized I need it

[Chorus: Young Swiffa]
I've been so hungry
Hungry for the cash
I've been too hungry
Yeah, hungry for the cash
They don't wanna see me
Unless it's broke and on my ass
I won't let 'em fool me
They won't take me for my last
Let's get to talkin' 'bout the cash
