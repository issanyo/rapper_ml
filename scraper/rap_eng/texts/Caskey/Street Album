[Intro]
Yeah, I love hearing myself in headphones, fuck everybody
This what I do every day: smoke weed, shit on you fuck boys
Get money, fuck my bitch, every single day (Black sheep)
Yeah, uh

[Hook]
Fuck a mixtape, this a street album
Don't know what the problem is? We the problem
Yeah, don't start this shit and it won't be problems
Yeah, I don't see these haters, only see the commas

[Verse 1]
Yeah, fuck a mixtape, pussy, this a street album
Every time they hate on me, I get to counting thousands
Labels calling Birdman up like, "How the fuck you found him?"
Bank deposit, wire transfer money got me drownin'
Too many hoes to count, I just might fuck a bitch at random
Snatch yo' bitch inside her ride but I don't need a ransom
Do you think that shit was luck or do you think he planned 'em?
Either way, he came long way from just being Brandon
Even back then I knew what I'd turn to, word to me in middle school
Did same thing now just cool, got a courtyard for a living room
Rappers wanna come and play with me
But I don't got no ego problem, I could be myself
That's the reason I'ma see the wealth
The only person that you need yourself

[Hook]
Fuck a mixtape, this a street album
Don't know what the problem is? We the problem
Don't start this shit and it won't be problems
Yeah, I don't see these haters, only see the commas

[Verse 2]
No apologies, don't let no fuck shit around him
How I made it so big out of nothing, shit astoundin'
Ain't they tell ya that the faith of one man move a mountain?
'magine when you got a team behind ya and you're grounded
No apologies, bitch, I ain't even sorry, I pull up here, I'm dumpin'
Make my circle smaller, only time I do reduction
Fucking my bitch on top the couch, yeah, that's my seduction
Treat me like I'm Billy Clinton, beast off his corruption
Bitch on BET, know you, hoe, been seeing me
Next year starting February, I'ma be on MTV
I don't brag 'bout my success, I got deals that's in the works
Think that Birdman sleepin' on me? Fuck that shit, it's time to work
Time to jump, time to hop out of the whip and tote the pump
Leave you slumped, what, ya think ya eating free? This ain't free lunch
I don't got no time to play, I barely got the time to sleep
Swear that all your shit like 7 days 'cause that shit sounding weak

[Hook]
Fuck a mixtape, this a street album
Don't start this shit and it won't be problems
Don't know what the problem is? Boy, we the problem
I don't see these haters talking, I just see the commas
Fuck a mixtape, this a street album
Don't start shit, it won't be problems
Don't know what it is? Pussy, we the problem
I don't see these haters, I just see the commas
Fucking yo' bitch
