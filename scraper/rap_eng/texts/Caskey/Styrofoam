[Intro: Caskey]
See, I'ma need to pour up, like, five zips

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Girl, you gotta keep it on the low, Promethazine sippin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's just how I'm livin'
I got pimpin' intuitions, mistress intermissions
Numbers and dollar signs be determining my position
I'm precision in the Cadillac, back track, reminisce on days
When I was griping on that black MAC, guns at the range
See all your bodies lying on the front page, but
My father made sure that I understood how them guns blaze
Blunt to my face, I'm subject to praise
Others be subject to rage, y'all just be subjects to change
All this talkin' 'bout bitches and Lamborghinis that you ain't in often
And I ain't from Dawson, from the Southside and got gators crossin'
Agent call me, agent call me, boy, if another agent call me
I'm engagin', homie, let these mofuckers know I'm KP only, KP only
See y'all roll up and I take two more sips
And then I tell this bitch to roll up like two more zips

[Hook: Caskey]
Girl, you gotta keep it on the low, Promethazine sippin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's just how I'm livin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's how I'm livin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's how I'm livin'
Gotta keep it on the low, Promethazine sippin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's just how I'm livin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's how I'm livin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's how I'm livin'

[Verse 2: ClicKlak]
I can't be pussy, it just ain't in me
I'ma die for this shit when they put some bullets in me
Chillin', pimpin', traffickin' women
A bitch named Peggy and she married with children
Plymouth Rocks, like I was a pilgrim
Your world's favorite rapper ain't shit 'cause I killed him
Tell me, have you ever seen bricks like a buildin'?
Bricks by the Buku, pounds to Belgium
Only thing got me scared: if a bitch nigga tell
God bless his soul, I'ma send his ass to Hell
Can't go against the grain, I'm just too real
Fishscale in the water like the brick had gills
You breathe in the pot when it form into rock
Keep my heat on my waist, by the stove 'cause it's hot
Ain't shit sweet, nah, I think not
If a bitch nigga try me, then his heart I stop (Hey!)

[Hook: Caskey]
Keep it on the low, Promethazine sippin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's just how I'm livin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's how I'm livin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's how I'm livin'
Gotta keep it on the low, Promethazine sippin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's just how I'm livin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's how I'm livin'
Double cup, Styrofoam, that's how I'm livin'

[Verse 3: Caskey & ClicKlak]
Shit, I been known to be a problem child, some call me wild
Others just call me for fronts 'cause they always loud
Yes, they always loud, like a concert crowd
If you ain't know, nigga, then you know now
They know now, know what the business is
'Cause I'm on this pimpin' shit and I'm ridin'
In a glass house, tryna find where the bitches is
He tryna find where the bitches is
I'm tryna find where the riches is
If I catch you slippin', I'ma hit you with a weapon
And I ain't gon' leave no witnesses
Bow! And the difference is, boy, I do this shit
You might keep yourself a nine, but you don't shoot this shit
What's happening, Cas? Let's get to the cash
And if a bitch nigga try me, that's gon' be they ass
And that's gon' be they last, and be they first
Time that they seen a hearse and been laid in the dirt
And that's what you get for fucking with a mob, dog
KPE, nigga, I'm the fucking boss hog

[Outro: Caskey & ClicKlak]
Wait, I thought I was... I thought I was the boss hog
That's what you get for thinking, boy
What the fuck does that make me, bruh?
The fucking janitor, or something?
Well, mop them floors then, nigga, if that's how you feel
Gone
