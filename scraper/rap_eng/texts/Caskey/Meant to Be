[Intro]
Uh, I can see the envy, wanna be me
Balling like I got myself a genie
It's hard work but it look easy
They far away but Lord I know they see me

[Hook]
They see me coming, seen the style, seen how I done it
They seen the game, how it changed and how I run it
Seen me coming, seen the check, seen the money
Seen the tens, seen the fifties, seen the hunnids

[Verse 1]
Off of shows, no more whipping at the stove top
How can I spread blessings to the whole block?
I seen a homeless man, he had on no socks
I bought him shoes, he sold 'em for like four rocks
People gonna hate you when you roll out
You can't let that shit fuck with you, roll out
You getting money? You might know about it
The key is not to make a show about it
I call up them killers, they get sent for me
I know it's gon' happen if it's meant to be
Baby signed me
I was in there wishing, I was grindin'
Opportunity when preparation meet the timin'
Now I got it coming, everything is in alignment
Yeah, you getting money? You might know about it
The key is not to make a show about it

[Verse 2]
Get to whippin', you at the stove about it
Gotta figure out how to go about it
You gettin' money? You might know about it
You gettin' money? You might know about it
This year, I lost my lover but I found myself
Pull up to the rap show, high as hell
Ain't a damn thing I gotta tell
Know the difference between your fam and your clientele
Pull up smoking weed at the function
When I was a teen, it was dumb shit
But everyday can't be some crumb shit
I guess that just ain't the way I function
Swerve through the city, they gon' show me love
We tell the girls show they titties 'cause we only thugs
I swear my life is way too good, I cannot hold a grudge
I got the baddest bitch, she with me, she don't fuck wit scrubs

[Hook]
That's because they seen me coming, seen the check, seen how I done it
Seen the game, how it changed and how I run it
They seen me coming, seen the check, seen the money
Seen the tens, seen the fifties, seen the hunnids

[Outro]
Its off of shows, it ain't from whipping at the stove top
They been tryin' to stop me, they got no shot
One of my homies run the whole block
Til the police shot him, hit him, four shots
'Cause people hate you when you roll out
You can't let that shit fuck with you, roll out
You getting money? You might know about it
You getting money? You might know about it
