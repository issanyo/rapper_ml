[Chorus: EJ King]
Fade away like Kobe, making plays on the sidelines
Talking like you know me, that's the way that you will get hogtied
I'm the bad guy, feel like I got mob ties (I do)
And that drank in my cup, I got all eyes
And them boys vouch for you, well, they all lie
Gotta go and make our beds, then we all lie in it
I'm a menace, Lord forgive us, God willin'
I'ma ride 'til the end of the road, don't care who with me

[Verse 1: EJ King]
I'm back with a hit, me and Caskey rolling zips
Make a play, I'm in the whip, we on the way to getting rich
I've been broke my whole life, ain't that about a bitch?
Think things about to change, like the gears on my switch
Carolina 'til the death, CRG what it is
Loyalty mean everything but everyday they switch, yeah
Never trust a soul, never trust a bitch, never fuck with hoes, gotta get it in
Money on my mind, I don't politic, I just flip it, go and get it again
Blowing the smoke in the ozone, I'm gone with the wind
Wolves of this shit, but we black sheep
I ain't got time for the friends, only got time for the money
Dividends and the hunnids, chasing checks, we runnin'
This rap shit, we run it, up just like the numbers, yeah

[Chorus: EJ King]
Fade away like Kobe, making plays on the sidelines
Talking like you know me, that's the way that you will get hogtied
I'm the bad guy, feel like I got mob ties (I do)
And that drank in my cup, I got all eyes
And them boys vouch for you, well, they all lie
Gotta go and make our beds, then we all lie in it
I'm a menace, Lord forgive us, God willin'
I'ma ride 'til the end of the road, don't care who with me

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Fuck your bitch, I might be her best of all time
Y'all some squares, like the tattoos on my jaw line
Smokin it fresh out the bag, I got no complaints, I got no apologies
She wanna fuck with a pimp, see in my eyes that only one god in me
See how I rised, took my lil sack, I made an economy
Seat on my side, nineteen-eleven, want no one to bother me
See that I died, in 2009, I'm scraping the pots
My pops told me peace when I left out to school, came back, he wasn't alive
My struggle was hard to describe, angels fly away and demons arrive
Milligrams chopped up on the counter, devilish things done to survive
The way I eat, bring it, I'ma demise, mama calling, I can't look in her eyes
Yeah, I've been down, and my downfall really starting to rise
Damn, I gotta go get the check and the bands, I cannot fuck with you Stans
Damn, I gotta change up my life, I'm hitting them licks, I'm riding with grams
Damn, ride with a fo' five in the front of my seat, I'm shooting the shots quick
Thinking that you know it all, the streets turn you to agnostic
Thinking that you sipping medicine, really everything is toxic
Thinking that you got the upperhand, then you come around and get drop kicked
My weed coming from the tropic, I made myself a trending topic
There's ecstasy inside the cockpit, your legacy is microscopic
I'm in charge to say the least, put my number on the beats, called up, got 'em on the east
Tryna make another payment, you know that your life only come with a lease
Gotta pay that shit back when you go, only reason I'm stacking this dough
Called up my partner like what's with the plug? Go meet me back at the stove

[Chorus: EJ King]
Fade away like Kobe, making plays on the sidelines
Talking like you know me, that's the way that you will get hogtied
I'm the bad guy, feel like I got mob ties (I do)
And that drank in my cup, I got all eyes
And them boys vouch for you, well, they all lie
Gotta go and make our beds, then we all lie in it
I'm a menace, Lord forgive us, God willin'
I'ma ride 'til the end of the road, don't care who with me

[Verse 3: EJ King]
Can't stop, won't stop, a soldier, I don't need your exposure
I don't need you controlling me, or my focus
Labels telling us bullshit, I struggle, I hustle the full shift
I put in the muscle, I'm cool with it, flexing like I'm benching 250
Light weight, you gotta stick with me, 1, 2, get it, say I'm the shit
Well the shoe fittin', my flow is so dirty, I need clinics, you gaspin'
Lackin' on each sentence, eat shit, I hope you hear this one
Try to compare, don't be sneak dissin', me and my brothers
We go through our troubles, but it's not for nothin'
We working on come ups, I'm telling y'all now, it's gon' be a cold summer
Got me feeling like the man, feeling like a band, why? 'cause my Glock got a drummer
And my knots getting dumber, this is not what y'all wanted
This is just what I'm on and become a legend, keep goin'

[Chorus: EJ King]
Fade away like Kobe, making plays on the sidelines
Talking like you know me, that's the way that you will get hogtied
I'm the bad guy, feel like I got mob ties (I do)
And that drank in my cup, I got all eyes
And them boys vouch for you, well, they all lie
Gotta go and make our beds, then we all lie in it
I'm a menace, Lord forgive us, God willin'
I'ma ride 'til the end of the road, don't care who with me
