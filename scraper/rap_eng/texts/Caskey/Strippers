You ever seen a bad bitch touch her toes?
The way she twerk it, going up and down the pole
Make her knees touch her fucking elbows
Bend over, make it shake like jello

[Verse 1: ClicKlak]
Filled out early when you was young so they singled you out
Same boyfriend through high school, started using your mouth
Then got pregnant and lost the baby, got kicked outta ya house
Broke up with ya man, moved in with a pimp, slept on my couch
But I want the money, motherfuck the honey
Pussy in the club and you gon' make it for me
You gon' make a nigga wanna go and rob them a bank
Breaking laws just to get a lick [?]
Gotta chop, provide it, hoping you apply it
Maximize your dollars, Follies, King of Diamonds
Fours in New Orleans, taking trips and ballin'
Tricks steady callin', money never stallin'
Trap phone be jumping and booming and shit
Hoping that I'm never losing this bitch
Praying to the Pimp God like, "Influence this bitch"
Got me thinking like, "What did I do to this bitch?"
Now she understand the gang, breaking tricks on lames
Shaking ass with chains, I taught her everything
Respectful to strippers that's making them figures
You like making money, come fuck with a nigga

[Verse 2: Caskey]
True story, yeah, similar, we're born at seventeen
Me and Pimpin' in Daytona
Back when he first done taught me how to flip with a bitch
And I beat that pussy to a coma
Back when the cigarettes and the spilled liquor
And the kush was my daily aroma
Back when I be inside the club, but not there to spend
No, I'd rather go sit in the corner
No, bitch, we can't hold you to money
Everything inside my hands
Yeah, that my bitch, no, but I ain't her mans
She house the blues and I come for the bands
I make the schedule, she get the plans
Me and Cheechi feeling freaky
Say that she got a friend, that bitch is sneaky
She know how to hustle, I take her to Hickley
Her pockets are healthy, she eating her Wheaties
Back when I was fucking Dee Dee
Back when I was with Natasha
Fuck them hoes, they was needy
Bounce back with two if they leave me
Don't even talk when they see me
But deep down, I know that they need me
And although I found me a new bitch to please me
Huh, this pimpin' ain't easy

[Verse 3: Pablo EscaBear]
Bounce it, roll it, twist it, shake it, twerk it for that cash flow
I'ma throw these hunnids, twenties, fifties on her ass though
Left cheek, right cheek, stop and move it real slow
Up and down, side to side, 'round and 'round, now here we go
She twerking for the 'Gram, doing shit I never seen before
Sexy, black like Jackie O, her pussy cream like Oreo
Cleo's, King of Diamonds, Magic City where she do the most
She never drink and barely smoke, baby daddy selling dope
You talk to her, you can't be broke, like green flags, she on go
'Round other hoes she running laps, break bread, she'll break your back
Certified, can't doubt that, make it rain, she'll make it clap
Keep the ones in trash bags, respect the hustle, I respect the racks
