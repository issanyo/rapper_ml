[Chorus: RPG]
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (racks)
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (big racks)
Got some shooters that I came with (some blowers)
Got some bad hoes that I came with (some baddies)
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (big racks)
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (big stacks)
Got some shooters that I came with (br-rat)
Got some bad hoes that I came with (woop)

[Verse 1: RPG]
All these rappers must got PMS
All my niggas snipe or sellin' drugs like we BMF
I just got a missile, I'ma let my new new chopper hit you
Buck and leave you lookin' like a fuckin' chupacabra, bitch, you...
Y'all ain't talkin' 'bout your mans
Thought yo' bitch was faithful, she said she had other plans
All that booty walkin', get to talkin' with my hands
I took it to the bedroom, pussy never had a, chance
Know I hold it down, don't you believe me?
It's gon' be hard to hate when nigga's on all your TV
I hope you change the channel like every time that you see me
That pussy get to movin', she deucin' just like a kiwi, he he
Yeah, that's that funny shit
You a Playboy bunny, honey, come to me, get plenty dick
Where your music, buddy? 'cause I swear I never heard this shit
Your favorite gun to rap about the same one you get murdered wit
Bitch

[Chorus: RPG]
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (racks)
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (big racks)
Got some shooters that I came with (some blowers)
Got some bad hoes that I came with (some baddies)
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (big racks)
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (big stacks)
Got some shooters that I came with (br-rat)
Got some bad hoes that I came with (esketit)

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Wait, aye, I'm in this bih big racked up
In the foreign with a foreign, I can't give that up
That shit keep you down, you got to get back up
Only one life, so I'm out here tryna live that up
I'm clutchin' the stainless, my bitch, she came out of Cambridge
They mad at me 'cause I done made it, said I came back from my hiatus
I'm fuckin' a bitch on the A-list, it's crazy, I hit it the greatest
I'm smokin' a pound of the flavors, I'm all in the town with the mayors
Y'all been hatin' from the sidelines, least you follow guidelines
Got that presidential rolex, that's because it's my time
I've been all up in the growhouse, should be the cover of High Times
They try run up on me, my nine gon' hit 'em nine times
I've been smokin' out the i8 with the doors suicide
If I want it, I go get it; only difference, you and I
Got some shooters that I came up, we gon' get what we desire
If you try to touch this water on me, they gon' open fire

[Chorus: RPG]
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (racks)
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (big racks)
Got some shooters that I came with (some blowers)
Got some bad hoes that I came with (some baddies)
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (big racks)
Run 'round this bitch big racked up (big stacks)
Got some shooters that I came with (br-rat)
Got some bad hoes that I came with (woop)
