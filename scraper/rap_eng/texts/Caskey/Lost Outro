Pressure plus pipes
I got the tool here strung on my right
And ever since i loss you pops i don't write
And that was like '09
But every time the beat come on i swear it's go time
My fingers start itchin'
The pieces of divine start clickin'
The mistress in my mind start strippin'
I swear that i'm at a constant conflict with these women
Cause all the studio time that i buy is way more important than anything that they've given
Ain't that a bitch
Owe that ho a couple dollars
Told her take it in blood or i'm crypt-ed
I swear at the top is my mission
Cause sometimes i feel like if you would have been proud
Then you wouldn't have gone missin'
Picture a child in his prison
Where nobody gon' write me
And nobody come to visit
And visually i'm sustained by walls of steel
Is it possible that the fire is all that's real, god damn
Am i a liar or is all this real
Is it true that the ones with the desires get all the meals
Cause i gotta eat
Shit and my momma got a stomach too
And if you talk bullshit how do i stomach you
Ridin' down the 417, sippin' 100 proof
Pop myself two or three bars
See what a cup will do
My girl tried to stop me, she weigh 102
Yellin' that she hate me
I swear i feel like it ain't nothin' new
Pulled up out the driveway like, "Fuck you!"
To the person who made that Smith & Wesson that my father used, "Fuck you!"
I swear i would've taken your life if i had the option
But god didn't give that shit to me
And lately i've been a problem
To any motherfucker who cross me
Yesterday i was in church
And the preacher he had the nerve
And banged his ass with that cross piece
I'm devilish get 'em off me
Hard to take another two steps when your feet turn to concrete
Not to mention you off-beat
Boy how could you hope to compete
Education is institutionalized
Everything on the news but truthfully its a lie
And everything that is truth
Is truthfully in disguise
Truth be told i'm an outlaw i was made to survive
Then why do i see bars of steel
Is it possible that the fire is all that's real, god damn
Am i a liar or all this real
Could it be the ones with the desire make all the pills
That got us like slaves
And my momma got chains too
And if you fuck with the system how do i change you
Other day spoke to my cousin
He said he changed crews
He got new homies and they bang too
Feel like he was made for this gangster shit
Wanna cop an AK, move to Anchorage
Ankle bracelet community control
His room use to get hoes and now it get patrolled
And the sad thing, he think that its cool
The fuck is it that we teaching in our schools, nothin!
And they don't even want that discussion
Cause T.V. shows, celebrities, and they budget
And the rest of the country is on, fuck it!
Robbin' and stealin'
Cause there ain't no jobs out here in Florida appealin'
Look at all these old folks retirement, funds
We take that shit with all our violence, guns
But really it's the system that made me
And the government think that i'm crazy
But i think that we lost
And i don't know if he did it with the cross
I feel like everybody on the Earth will pay the cost
And maybe we will see bars of steel
And maybe i am hard to kill
I could truthfully optimize all that's real
I could be the O.G. tellin' you guard ya grill
I could be the devil on ya shoulder
Or your friend homie
And it all just depends homie
Cause we are lost
Truth be told we are lost
Whats it feel like in the world when you lost
Don't know which way to go
All i see is dollar signs
It's a long, long road
