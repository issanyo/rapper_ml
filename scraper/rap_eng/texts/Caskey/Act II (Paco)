Man, this generation is so fucked. Everyone's fucked. Everyone's got their head down, getting fucked by the man, working for the man. Fuck that. I'm here to fucking make money, bitch, fuck the rules, fuck society. I'm my own boss. I fucking run shit, 'cause nobody gave me shit. I got this shit on my own. I'm not like my generation. I never will be. I'm a star. Not a movie star, but a actual star, from out of this fucking world
