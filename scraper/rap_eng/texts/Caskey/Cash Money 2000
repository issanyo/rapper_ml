[Intro]
You know you bubbling when they talking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Haters, careful when you bring the style 'round 'em
Fuck these pussies, run a mile 'round 'em
Just jumped out of county, 'bout to bring hell for 'em
I stayed on the shelf for 'em, but it took y'all too long
Man, I'm done wishing well for 'em
Lay down my pride
I made this rap money and some on the side
I hear what the blog say is live
I think that shit like you, deprived
You folding when they start interrogation
Hate that fuck shit, but you scared to say shit
That's your partner, how you bare the statement?
All these fucking pussies got contamination

[Hook]
Who got the dope to sell?
Who got the doors to kick?
Who got the hoes to trick?
Who make the money flip?
Cash Money Records up in this bitch
And we gon' keep it 2000
Somewhere, sitting on an island
You lil motherfuckers still whilin'
We got all the money, why is you smilin'?

[Bridge 1]
We coming straight for the gualas
Ain't no use in tryin' to stall us
137 text messages this morning
Man, I promise
1,800 different emails
You don't need to know the details
Most of them about deposits
You busy tweeting like some females

[Verse 2]
I've been sober for a couple days
Time to get geeked again
I'm fucking yo' bitch every Monday
We don't talk on the weekends
I'm staying solid when they creeped in
You shallow, why you in the deep end?
I got money, I don't need friends
I'm just kicking all these rappers' teeth in! Yeah!

[Hook]
Who got the dope to sell?

And we gon' keep it 2000
Somewhere, sitting on an island
You lil motherfuckers still whilin'
We got all the money, why is you smilin'?

[Bridge 2]
Thumbing through the check
I cum on my bitch, call it "cumin' correct"
I'm thumbing through the check
How many women here wanna have sex?
I'm thumbing through the check
Show me them titties, I always got time to get busy
How much more can I put on for the city?
How much did I take? I'm starting to get dizzy

[Verse 3]
I can't stand a motherfucker wanna tweet about ya
Won't say it to ya face though (Pussy)
You the reason I ain't on social media
I'm off at the lake show
Ain't no one out here you could wait for
You gotta go and get it, full speed ahead
People only finna take more
They dead to ya, only fools feed the dead
Speed through the light, no red
Shout out VL where I shop
Got the rubber bands in the shoe box
Bandanna 'round my head, 2Pac
In the streets, we roll with the moon rocks
I'm a iced-out human jukebox
Well known only in a few spots
Ignant, call her watch "Hublots"
