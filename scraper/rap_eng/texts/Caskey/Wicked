[Intro: SKYXXX]
Yeah, pussy ass nigga got me twisted
Ran up on him, did that boy wicked, hm, yeah, yeah
I just got the work then I flipped it, ayy
Call me the trap magician, yeah

[Verse 1: SKYXXX]
My bitch talk to me but I don't listen, ayy
Run up on me, boy, you end up missin’, yeah
Yo' bitch come and see me with me no lipstick, yeah
I light up my tree like it's Christmas, ayy, ayy
You ain’t welcome here, boy, mind your bidness, ayy
We be water-whippin' in this kitchen, lil boy, ayy
I just popped a tab and now I'm trippin', yeah
Chopper on my side tall like a midget, yeah, ayy
I just fucked a bitch, her name was Bridgett, yeah
I was smokin' dope and she was sniffin', yeah
Can't believe I fucked that hoe in front her children, yeah
That's how that lil ratchet hoe was livin’, yeah

[Refrain: SKYXXX]
My bitch talk to me but I don’t listen
Fuck around with me, you end up missin'
My bitch talk to me but I don’t listen
Pussy ass nigga got me twisted

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Okay, I took away his work and then remixed it
They say they talkin' money, all I hear is crickets (huh, huh, huh)
They sendin' threats my way but they is not specific
I feel like they just not the person they depictin'
I’m sellin' work the same color as my pigment
When I hop up out the car, they like "who is it?"
I'm at the bar with foreign broads, we tradin' digits
She on her knees but not a one of us religious
Tatted up from head to toe but say I hate commitment
I never take the drugs the way the doctor recommended
A product of society, it turned me to a menace
And I ain't goin' back and forth with you 'cause this ain't tennis

[Verse 3: SKYXXX]
Pussy ass nigga got me twisted
Ran up on that boy, did him wicked, ayy
Caught him lackin' at Popeye's Chicken, ayy
Unlucky boy, he ain't had a biscutt, yeah, yeah
I'm in the Uber gettin' lifted, yeah
I be fuckin' hoes like Scott Disick, yeah
My last bitch callin' me, say I'm different, ayy
When it come to money, I'm addicted, yeah
