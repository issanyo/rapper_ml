[Chorus: Producer Prez]
I've been struggling so long, I ain't ever going back
I've been hustling so hard, I can't ever go back
Give it all you got 'cause if you don't, it's for no reason
Nobody said that the road would be easy

[Verse 1: Producer Prez]
Tore down, teased, picked on, beated
But the one thing no one's ever seen me is defeated
I got God on my side, this a blessing
I got [?] on my song, it's a blessing
You gotta look up, see the sky just one more time
You gotta live, feel the high just one more time
Pick up his feet, grind, one more time
Think about the pot of gold when you finally cross the line
My first pair of Jordans, I had to trap 'em
Never forget my mama's face when I came home tatted
Still determined to put gold on my wrists
I never gave up, I gave my life to the biz
Gotta hustle, gotta grind, gotta die for this shit
Gotta cope, gotta roll, get high off this shit
You gotta look up, see the sky one more time
You gotta live, feel the high one more time
That's what's up, prayers

[Chorus: Producer Prez]
I've been struggling so long, I ain't ever going back
I've been hustling so hard, I can't ever go back
Give it all you got 'cause if you don't, it's for no reason
Nobody said that the road would be easy
Yo, what's up, Caskey?

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Caught in the lights and indecision
You get one time, I gotta follow my intuition
'round the summer time, all of my dogs are in the kitchen
[?] checked up, no stops paying tuition
I'm a icon, I got no time for intermission
On my Nikon, I got a movie with dirty bitches
Ice on, I go and get it, you can't be wishin'
When I light one, all of my thoughts come to fruition
Into manifestation, not up for limitation
Not for intimidation, all of my shit amazin'
You say they got bars, they really just imitation
We crossing state lines for money like immigration
Liberation, free myself from my thoughts
You know my job's to inspire a generation
Implication, yeah, I've been struggling for so long
This is a celebration (Tell 'em) because we made it

[Chorus: Producer Prez]
I've been struggling so long, I ain't ever going back
I've been hustling so hard, I can't ever go back
Give it all you got 'cause if you don't, it's for no reason
Nobody said that the road would be easy
