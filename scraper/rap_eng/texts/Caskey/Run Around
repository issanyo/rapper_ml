[Intro: ClicKlak]
I made that bitch run around the bity, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: ClicKlak]
Don't get caught up in the skreets that I run around
If I up that chopper, make him run around
Put her on the track and made her run around
I just gave that silly bih the run around
Don't get caught up in them skreets that I run around
If I up that chopper, make him run around
Put her on the track and made her run around
I just gave that silly bih the run around

[Verse 1: Caskey]
God damn, I always keep the piece when I run around
I'm smoking on Chief Keef, got a hunnid pounds
I switch up the landscape
I hop out the ride and me and my bruh do the handshake
And you better chill for your man's sake
We did the feature and I took the fanbase
Hop out the Benzo
I got the Forgiatos on the rim, not Lorenzo
And you got a okay lil bitch in the ride
But I see the potential
She plan on bringing the money back to me
And she ain't gon' get no complaints
I just hopped inside the pussy
And that shit was wet like the paint
Whoa, and I'm the type of shit you ain't
The ride is bulletproof, a tank
I was known for serving dank
You were known for overdrafts at the bank
I been outside in the places that you never visit
I ain't got no dough for them bitches
You in the eye of the storm and don't know the conditions
When you on the road to riches

[Hook: ClicKlak]
Don't get caught up in the skreets that I run around
If I up that chopper, make him run around
Put her on the track and made her run around
I just gave that silly bih the run around
Don't get caught up in them skreets that I run around
If I up that chopper, make him run around
Put her on the track and made her run around
I just gave that silly bih the run around

[Verse 2: ClicKlak]
Monkey see, monkey do, huh?
Where my nina at?
I ain't talking 'bout my mama's mama
Where my nina at?
Nina clip for that monkey nigga
Acting like he run my habitat
Got my own weed, you can't front me, nigga
Smoking like I might got cataracts
My turn on the song, I'm livin'
"Pimpin', won't you pass them the ganja?"
I go for gold and you can get the bronze
I want Beyonc√©, but you get Solange
I got the head like I work at salon
All my bitches getting freaky
Strong pimpin', bitches paying me weekly
Wonder how, motherfuck that new Lamborghini
I might just have to free my genie
Got a pimp walk [?]
I get the cheese like my name ziti
Fill her up with dick, she acting greedy
Now the bitch never wanna leave me
Now the bitch always wanna see me
I can't blame her, I wanna see me too
Fuck a milli, I wanna see me two

[Hook: ClicKlak]
Don't get caught up in the skreets that I run around
If I up that chopper, make him run around
Put her on the track and made her run around
I just gave that silly bih the run around
Don't get caught up in them skreets that I run around
If I up that chopper, make him run around
Put her on the track and made her run around
I just gave that silly bih the run around

[Verse 3: Gwalla]
The places I be, you don't come around
Like dirty police, you get gunned down
Got a hunnid round, hear that metal sound
When them bullet shells follow, hit the ground
So please do not push me, I'm back in the city
Got R&B packs of that Bobby and Whitney
I'm tipsy off whiskey, my diamonds look pissy
I smoke like a hippy on strains of the sticky
Vicky left hickies
She ride me like a bike, she no complaints
You're mad she fucked with me, then step in the paint
I pull up like demons, you act like a saint
Bullets fly, they don't got no restraints
Chopper singing, you might think that it's Drake
PARTYNEXTDOOR, your bitch coming home late
We don't go on dinner dates
I just put it in her face
Diamonds on, regulation
Talk show niggas fake
Lying 'bout what they make
Grass cut, fuck the stakes
Then I leave, where my rate?
Get go for the pay
Then I pull off in a Wraith

[Hook: ClicKlak]
Don't get caught up in the skreets that I run around
If I up that chopper, make him run around
Put her on the track and made her run around
I just gave that silly bih the run around
Don't get caught up in them skreets that I run around
If I up that chopper, make him run around
Put her on the track and made her run around
I just gave that silly bih the run around

[Verse 4: Madz]
Through the customs [?] they be like "Who's he?"
We don't know [?] my bros [?] fix up, fix up
Them ways that the kid could go [?] that you're throwin'
And I sense you ain't no sensei
When I cut the cord, it starts to [?]
Like, "Haven't you been heard before?"
The bad boy from the UK made it
There's so many sides to this guy
I swear blind that Madz has got an alias
Price went up, now they off some favors
What's your flavor, boy?
When I drove for dro, I'll seek and then destroy you
Want peace? [?] they'll peep on chums
Call me the [?] as they did when [?]
Well thug, I need more blessings, more reverends
Less pressure, more force [?]
Katy Perry, Brittany Spears, I seen it
Made them disappear like your career, I mean that
Looking nervous and I feel that
Feel your ego, boy, you [?]
Mind your mouth [?]
My Jesus been a body darker than some kneecaps

[Hook: ClicKlak]
Don't get caught up in the skreets that I run around
If I up that chopper, make him run around
Put her on the track and made her run around
I just gave that silly bih the run around
Don't get caught up in them skreets that I run around
If I up that chopper, make him run around
Put her on the track and made her run around
I just gave that silly bih the run around
