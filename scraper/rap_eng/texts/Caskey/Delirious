[Hook: Caskey]
You stepping to me? Dog, you can't be serious
I'm on so much drugs that I'm delirious
I hustle hard with all my partners them, yeah
We see the commas, you just see the periods

[Verse 1: Caskey]
And your shit gon' come right to an end and we just started
We get on a half a gram of Molly, get retarded
Me and all my enemies [?] in the party
We kill ourselves for greatness, man, it turn us to some martyrs
I pull up at the plug house, now my money getting shorted
You think you killing me? I think your point of view distorted
I'm looking at my bitch, that chick imported, that's my glory
I'm telling nothing but true shit in my story, word to Cory
Now I just can't complain because I did it all myself
I'm focused on my inner peace, don't care 'bout no one else
I'm manifestin' destiny, that fuck shit gettin' shelved
I got that nineteen 'leven in my belt
But I pray for peace, y'all tell too much shit to say the least
I'ma touch down when they least expect it, we gon' play for keeps
Someone said they got more heart than me, they can't be serious
I'm with Maxccent, you ain't talking money, we ain't hearin' shit, lil bitch

[Hook: Caskey]
You stepping to me? Dog, you can't be serious
I'm on so much drugs that I'm delirious, yeah
I turn up hard with all my partners them, yeah
We want the commas, you just see the periods, yeah
And your shit been coming to an end and we just started
We get on a half a gram of Molly, get retarded
Me and all my enemies [?] in the party
Yeah, we just getting started

[Verse 2: Maxccent]
Uh, every frequency
Yeah, I know my haters and they thinking me
One thing on my mind, and I'm thinking green, see our future
Not everything can last, hit that gas, then we gone in a flash
Smoking drones, don't look back, fuck with stacks
If you ain't got cash, you be going home, pedal to the flo'
New or old, this is how it go
Running like a piston, yeah, getting started, high to low
Put me under this microscope
Frequent transactions and I'm drawn out this dope
This ain't a hoax, if you taking jokes
All this paper made with a, with a, microphone
I see the pattern, blast it through the stereo
Nothing now too, everybody know
'cause this is how it go, yeah
This is how it go, oh, oh

[Hook: Caskey & Maxccent]
You stepping to me? Dog, you can't be serious
I'm on so much drugs that I'm delirious
I hustle hard with all my partners them, yeah
We want the commas, you just see the periods, yeah

[Verse 3: Maxccent]
Yeah, these my genes that make the salary
We the kings, where's the peanut gallery?
Life's luxurious, I got originality
On every frequency, I know my haters
And they thinking me, I'm thinking green, got here clean
Young and I'm living dreams, at the top the ladder
Checks coming by the hour (Every night, different powder)
That you about to see, this any game of chest is just some alchemy
So I see you back, yeah, we the best
Yeah, then I stop, then I see the rest
Ain't a theft, yeah, then I exit, stage left
Exit, exit, stage left
