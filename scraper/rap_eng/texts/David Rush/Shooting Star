I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite

[Verse 1: David Rush]
I caught her when she fell from Heaven
One to ten, baby girl's an eleven
And I ain't tryn' spit no game
But I'm trying to figure out from where you came
Because a star like hers
Man, it really occurs in a world like this
Only way you ever meet a girl like this
Get up in a spaceship and take that trip
We kinda have a way with words
We even start a convo' to get at her
Every other chick becomes a blur
Be my misses, I'll be your sir
I love her, the way she is
The way she are, a shooting star
And I pray that you never change (never ever change)
Please stay the same, 'cause

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, baby girl, that's a shooting star with your name
I ain't gonna lie
I've told a lot of lies and played a lot of games
But with you, it's not the same
For you, I'ma ride, I want you by my side
I feel like them Geto Boys, you playing with my mind
I'ma tell you one more time (tell you one more time)
For you I'ma grind
You were there through the pain
You stood right by me, thanks to you I survived
I guess it's true what they say, love is blind
We together till the day that we die
Until death do us part
Baby you my heart
They can take all the houses and the cars
But they'll never take my shooting star

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you

That's why you are my favorite
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you

That's why you are my favorite

[Verse 3: David Rush]
Now as I lay her down to sleep
Pray my Lord this girl I keep
Usually, by now I would've went and creep
With a P.Y.T. that I met last week
But it's something about this one
That make me not have to go get none
Ask her what I need and it goes get done
And the same thing back so it makes us one
So every morning when I roll over
Pray that she's there on my arm and shoulder
And I can be her blanket when the world gets colder
Watch me make her, watch me mold her
She got me open like my doors and drawers
Heart beats fast like I stole a car
I never thought it would go this far
Tonight I wish on a shooting star
(Star, star, star)
