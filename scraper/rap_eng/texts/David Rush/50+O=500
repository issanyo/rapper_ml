[Intro: Omari Hardwick]
Yo, the Ferarri man and the O
History in the making right here, we had to it
50+O, I'ma keep it five hunnid

[Hook: David Rush]
They say I done changed when I got the change
They say I was frontin', I don't owe nobody nothin'
I always kept it real, I always kept it a hunnid
But I know the name [?]
I remember days when stomach hurtin' the pain
I promised to myself that I never need again
Always kept it real, always it 100
But now it's 50+O, I'ma keep it five hunnid
What up?
50+O equal, equal five hunnid
50+O equal, equal five hunnid
What up?
50+O yeah, equal five hunnid
50+O, I'ma keep it five hunnid

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
We different pedigrees we come from different blocks
You know I don't fuck with you but you cool with my opps
Nigga ain't nothing like me be the same
I can get to snitching on on your whole damn gang gang gang gang gang gang
From the get go, I'ma a trip
Nigga I be on some shit
Put that paper, gold case, where I go you know
I ain't out here fuckin' 'round
Niggas know how I get down
When they supposed to blow, these gunshots blow for sure
We don't see no evil, hear no evil where I be
Did I hit that boy in broadday, we ain't seen a thing
Shit I'm kicking is a fact
Get 'em up, get the strap, get 'em back, fuck that

[Verse 2: Omari Hardwick]
Rose through the cracks
Like a rose through the cracks
So my rose a little cracked
So I flew a bit off track
But my train of thought intact
Brain don't ever take a nap
500 stacks, got a whole lotta dat, dat, dat
Trying to make a killing
Niggas dying from too much killing
50 say the best, we forgettin'
Many men wish death when you're winning
I say the rest is [?]
Fiddy plus O a different villain
I get paid to make it realer
All the way from A to Gorilla
For the kids in the project [?]
I got some projects I'm building
I got some scars but I'm healing
Got some scars but I'm wishing
Got some rocks that I'm dealing
I'm a rockstar with a different living
Fiddy plus O, fuck with it
Keep [?]

[Interlude]
If you just run from somebody face, a lot of people ain't gon' be able to take that over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. They just not gon' want that. Run up to a motherfucker, the you ain't gotta worry about that no more
