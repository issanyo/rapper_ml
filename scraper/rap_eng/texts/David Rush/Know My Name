[Intro]
Hahaha, yeah, its DannyP

My flows is north pole cold
You know my name, you know my name, y-y-you know, you know my name (x2)


[Verse 1: DannyP]

Uh, the chances are that you prolly never heard of me
I'm coming from a small town, and I had so much uncertainty
That I would never reach the fame and they would never hear my name
I'm stealing peoples hearts through my music like it's burglary
And if you didn't know, well my music is original
And people tend to hate, but now I keep that to a minimal
Used to be blurry but now I'm giving them a visual
Working at a desk job, well that just sounds so typical
And ever since the first grade I been always tryna think about it
Searching for a path of life but now I get to speak about it
Sitting in a classroom and joking for attention
But it never paid off, and I wound up in detention
I want the shows, the crowds, the cameras and lights
And if you feeling like it's possible you'll be alright
I go by D, to the A, to the double N Y - P
And I want it more than ever ain't nothing gonna stop me

[Hook]
My flows is north pole cold
You know my name, you know my name, y-y-you know, you know my name (x4)

[Verse 2: David Rush]

Rusher, ha!
Welcome youngen to a game that'll drive you insane
Even if they know your name you still don't know your name
They act like, you ain't nice, when you spit them words
They act like, you ain't right, when you flip them verbs
But keep a, thick skin and your focus all fixed in
When your path gets dim your swagger should kick in
Remember, haters is losers, you go for your next win
If music is a drug it's okay you can just binge
But emotions don't get broken my homie they just bend
And this game will keep you open be careful who gets in
When you hot, best friends, when you cold, in the wind
When you find another hit the cycle begins again
Never sacrifice who you are, just to be a star
Everybody wanna ride, but don't put gas in the car
Follow these simple rules, guarantee you'll be cool
'Cos you can pay the price of fame and they won't know your name, it's a shame
Rusher

[Outro: DannyP]
I said, they don't really know my name now but
They will soon, you feel me?
