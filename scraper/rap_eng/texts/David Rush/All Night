[Intro: Pitbull]
Rush, Mr. Worldwide
You can catch me in Russia
At a billionaire's night
No I never rush 'em, but I get what I like
Baby, no Russian, I'ma tell you what I like

[Hook 1: Pitbull]
Girl it's on tonight
You got me tripping off them strobe lights
You know this Vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
And we can go from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night
From the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night

[Verse 1: David Rush]
So where you wanna go baby girl, no I don't care
Any universe, any atmosphere
Clock say 1:12 so we're outta here
We can do it anywhere
She throwing up dubs screaming West Side
I got a Cali king you can fit just right
Pick cars depending on what's the best drive
Give you the keys, let you test drive
Top floor with the suite sound great
Looking out the window over the Tri-state
She come mad early and leave mad late
And I ain't eating at the table, don't need no plates
Her clothes in the bedroom floor
We're not even in the bedroom no more
I get a text message in the morn'
Like daddy, where you headed, do me like that for

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2: David Rush]
Baby we can go from the hallway to the backroom
Go upstairs, back down soon
My couch's soft, my floor too
We can take a day if you want to
Turn you on like TV, HD, 3D
I spin you around like a CD
Baby don't make it so easy
She boiling like water with tea in the kettle
She wrecking my place like the Tasmanian devil
I'm giving the base, she giving the treble
And we turn it up, to the next level
I told her we can do it when the sun's up
Or we can get it in when the sun's down
Or maybe we can meet halfway
Either way, baby girl I'ma put it down

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2: Pitbull (David Rush)]
Girl it's on tonight
You got me tripping off them strobe lights
You know this Vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
(yeah, let's show 'em tonight)
And we can go from the bed to the floor (yeah)
From the window to the wall (let's go)
No matter where we are, we can do it all night
From the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall (Rush)
No matter where we are, we can do it all night (and Mr. Worldwide)
