[Verse 1]
Walking the dog in my neighborhood
Said I never would, for you for you
I got drunk on a Monday night
Hope it looks alright, tattoo of you, oo
I'm a yes man on the loose, yeah
Maxed out all my credit cards
Bought your favorite car, times two

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm crazy for you, Lord knows what I'd do
I'd even die for you
Whatever you need, I'm down on my knees
I guess that means, I guess that means

[Chorus]
I’m dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
I’m stupid in love
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Stupid
I’m stupid in love
Stupid

[Verse 2]
Uh. re-decorate my crib
Can't believe I did, it's true, it's true
I'm ashamed but I said okay
To share a Facebook page with you, with you
'Cause I'm a yes man on the loose, ooh, yeah
And I'll do anything for you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm crazy for you, Lord knows what I'd do
I'd even die for you
Whatever you need, I'm down on my knees
I guess that means, I guess that means (means I'm dumb)

[Chorus]
I’m dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
I’m stupid in love, yeah, yeah
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Stupid
I’m stupid in love, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stupid (yeah)

[Bridge]
And they can all call me crazy (crazy)
I'm a fool for you, baby (baby)
But they ain't never seen you naked, naked
Uh, they can all call me crazy (crazy)
I'm a fool for you, baby (baby)
But they ain't never seen you naked, no, oh, naked

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm crazy for you, Lord knows what I'd do
I'd even die for you (I'd die for you, baby)
Whatever you need, I'm down on my knees
I guess that means, I guess that means (means I'm dumb)

[Chorus]
I’m dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb (woah)
Dumb da da dee da dumb
I’m stupid in love, ooh, yeah
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
Dumb da da dee da dumb
I’m stupid in love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm stupid in love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stupid
