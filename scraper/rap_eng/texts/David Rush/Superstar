Baby I'm a superstar, baby I'm a superstar

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Everybody wanna motherfuckin' die, I come see I who?
Me, P-I-T!
That chico way off and in cut talking 'bout
Fuck VIP!
Them boys never talk same thing as the block
Now we're flipping in the rock
They don't listen to rock'n'roll and heavy metal
But they still rock some rose and bust heavy metal
See them boys in the bottom on another level
So fast to the point that it up take the devil
Put your k to the [?] that's what it is

Go tip Chevy, it's all eat heavy
It won't be ready, now boy spit it
Cause I party like a rockstar
Look like a movie star,fuck like a pornstar

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Qwote]
And the ladies wanna wild fuckin' night

Camera's all record so give me what you got, baby show me
Much of you stars in here, you Pamela and I'll be talking Lee

Fuck like a pornstar, hey!

[Bridge 1: Vein]
We never sleep at party like rock'n roll
We drink all your Bacardi like we didn't know
We fuck like, what, usher baby nice and slow
Cause we're superstars

[Verse 3: Vein]
Anybody want a motherfuckin' drink, right now?
Meet me at the liquor store
Cause I ain't buying shit right now
In this overass priced bar
You'd better holla at pit for that shit
Boy got me fucking with the baddest bitch
And on my dick, grew by an extra inch
I'm not your average local artist
I'm an artist who goes loco on it
Vein, if you heard you up on game, name
Cause I'll never hit the same name, twice
If you heard of know me, dang nice
I'm a new motherfucker breaking in town
With 305, Pit, cold-blocking it down!

[Bridge 2: David Rush]
Now you know what it is
And I know I ain't got A say
Life is like a movie and starring me always
Party like a rockstar from night until the day
So get it how you live it (Yeah, rush up)

[Verse 4: David Rush]
Always wanna brag, always wanna boast
Tryin to get that money, pop the toast
So the pricks come around, get it ghost

Movie star, don't you see that flash?
Rolling like an all-star baby
And hitting like a pornstar baby
