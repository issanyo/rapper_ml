[Verse 1]
Can't put down the phone talking to you
We laughin' all night 'till we see sunlight
They say you know when you just know
Yeah 'cause it feels right not just for one night

[Pre-Chrous]
It's real we can't turn it off
It's real you keep my heart up
It's real, ooh

[Chrous]
'Cause you know just how I feel, that's love
We don't have to speak, that's love
Only you and me, that's love, that's love
When you know just what to say, that's love
We don't play no games, that's love
No, we will never change, that's love, that's love

[Verse 2]
You always say all the right things
You got me thinking about you when I'm dreaming
When I'm with you, I feel beautiful
You make me feel weightless, don't ever change this

[Pre-Chrous]
It's real we can't turn it off
It's real you keep my heart up
It's real, ooh

[Chrous]
'Cause you know just how I feel, that's love
We don't have to speak, that's love
Only you and me, that's love, that's love
When you know just what to say, that's love
We don't play no games, that's love
No, we will never change, that's love, that's love

[Verse 3]
I don't care what they say we got fire
We can love let it burn take me higher
Won't let it go, won't let it go ever
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I don't care 'cause your love gives me power
Every day, every second, every hour
Won't let it go, won't let it go ever, ever

[Chrous]
'Cause you know just how I feel, that's love
We don't have to speak, that's love
Only you and me that's love, that's love
When you know just what to say, that's love
We don't play no games, that's love
No, we will never change, that's love, that's love

[Bridge]
La-la-la-love
La-la-la-love
La-la-la-la-la-la-love
La-la-la-love
La-la-la-love
La-la-la-la-la-la-love

[Outro]
When you know just what to say, that's love
We don't play no games, that's love
No, we will never change, that's love, that's love
That's love
