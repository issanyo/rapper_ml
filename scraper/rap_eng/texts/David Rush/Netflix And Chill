[Chorus]

Ha ha ha (yeah)

Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
When she see me calling she know what’s up
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
When she see me calling she know what’s up

[Verse 1]

She said that her last man was boring
She wake up to head in the morning
I spread out her legs like she Jordan
I win a Oscar for performing
Extra juicy when I eat her
She be dripping, Aquafina
I beat the pussy, Ike and Tina
Now she hoping I don’t leave her
She got me high like a satellite
She like to ride like a motor bike
I like them nasty you know that’s right
She play with my kids like its Fisher Price
Fucking, sucking, kissing, rubbing hit it till she cumming
I don’t play for nothing baby I ain’t stunting
I don’t trick for nothing, girl you know you want it
Tell me when you coming

[Chorus]

Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
When she see me calling she know what’s up
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
When she see me calling she know what’s up

[Verse 2]

She said that her body is for taking
I said my that my love is for making
I told her Time I won't take it
I want to see all of you naked (yea yea)
Slow it down baby its nowhere to go
(nowhere to go 2x) Now you be the movie now give me a show

Switch positions girl I’m on a mission
Got so many tricks she going to think magician
Started on the bed ended in the kitchen
Told me what she wanted
Gave her what she wishing

O Yea, O Yea…..Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck

[Chorus]
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
When she see me calling she know what’s up
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
Netflix and Chill and we smoke and fuck
When she see me calling she know what’s up

You know you know  what's up
When she see me calling she know what’s up
You know you know  what's up
When she see me calling she know what’s up
