What right do I have to impose
The skyscraping, dizzying highs and brutal lows
What kind of qualifications or expertise do I hold to create a life
I'm an orphan, even from that plate, doesn’t taste right
It's not as important as the whole prevention of suffering
What if that was the goal? Not to inflict this upon other beings
Its kinda cold
But let's consider this
Either you predator or prey
Still the amount of death that you face is ridiculous
Some people wander around and wonder why us?
Why would I ever inflict this on something I love?
A lethal blip
Just to engage in an ego trip
In which evil exist and nature needs no assist
Say we opted out
Be life going its own way
Never creating it to suffer, knowing it goes away
This world ain’t worthy of my kids
If not of usage if I can prevent their birth then imma do it

Chorus
Cause if I had a choice
I would never bring a life into this world
As if I had a choice
I'd prefer it had not been done to me
If I had a choice
I would never inflict this kind of misery
As if I had a choice
I'd rather not exist within an oblivious sea of peace

Better to never have been than experience
You probably think differently
But I believe life insidious
Follow me
A novelty? Sure
A sentiment due to wear off
Hardly a gift, at best its a job
Where your retirement either consists of either you getting sick
Or family that you love you miss and you reminisce for
The interest to this place
You can seal and lock doors
This wouldn't of been a universe that I opted for
The inherent entropy outweighs the time and work
I'd like to see you justify the crime of birth
Protest my life for not creating any
I can save souls from hell like your saviour sent me
Safer ending
Im sure its the closest to it
And even though it promises loss and pain most would do it
We wouldn't swim the life-stream choking on fluid within pandora's box open for viewing

Chorus
Cause if I had a choice
I would never bring a life into this world
As if I had a choice
I'd prefer it had not been done to me
If I had a choice
I would never inflict this kind of misery
As if I had a choice
I’d rather not exist within an oblivious sea of peace

If the beat is the room, my rhyme’s elephant
The question is would it be better to have never been
A philosophical conundrum
Fearful people can always be triggered when you rob them of their comforts
The scale of life when compared to vacuum a sad display
The infinities make the finites evaporate
Never visit this upon another
As long as I can muster the courage and strength to not be your buster
They gon claim in anguish
Mainly because I'm famous
They told me to beware of shaming language
But I aim to change it
Dug up the facts
Compare the risk reward ratio aspect and none of it matched
Though it’s tempting
Yeah the possibilities will lie to your face
The only way is by denying the fate
So I play it safe and keep my unborn undisturbed safe in a sacred place

Chorus
Cause if I had a choice
I would never bring a life into this world
As if I had a choice
I'd prefer it had not been done to me
If I had a choice
I would never inflict this kind of misery
As if I had a choice
I'd rather not exist within an oblivious sea of peace
