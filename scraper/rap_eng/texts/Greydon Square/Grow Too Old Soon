[Verse 1]
I used to be good. Just weed and a bag of chips
Now I’m more fascinated by DMT and Acid Trips
A partial cosmos. We live in just a patch of it
I’m more into the symmetrical negative that matching it
We don’t know where reality stops
It could be a simulation or a sanity lost
I talk but my family of thoughts is dysfunctional
I’m lost just like everyone else, I can’t punish you
Lowercase c represents light speed
All these subliminal hints to Type III
Might be just a pipe dream inside the
Mind of a fried group home kid psyche
These aren't parts they’re images of the whole
We are stardust. A ship? assemble it and we’ll go
Be apart of the trip the membership and the goal
From the start we’ll put into it heart until we’re old

[Hook]
We grow too old soon, and too late wise
Useful lives full trying to escape time
A few remain just to hang with the great minds
The most insane work and strain ‘til it’s break time

You remain claimless, I’m a stake mine
I didn't become famous, it became mine
I aimed to have my story carved into the cave line
That’s why we playing for tomorrow while today’s fine

[Verse 2]
Don’t want to be viewed like a prized athlete
....as long as I change one life with my music then i’ll die happy
This is the curse of the creative person
The integrity of the art or just to the chance to sign your name in cursive
If you don’t love money they say you’re worthless
Aimless waiter servants waiting on the industry like table service
To give em able purpose
Write their rhymes for em and lay their verses
...and you wonder why the game has worsened
...Guys battle even less than before
I’d rather leave an easy lesson for all
Before I exit this world
..and the only thing I’d regret
Is that I didn't discover earlier how to be fresh
....with the lyrics and the bar schemes
Blame my situation its part environment part genes
And it’s part me I’ll admit it
Hip hop was my wife, my mistress composition

[Hook]
We grow too old soon, and too late wise
Useful lives full trying to escape time
A few remain just to hang with the great minds
The most insane work and strain ‘til it’s break time

You remain claimless, I’m a stake mine
I didn’t become famous, it became mine
I aimed to have my story carved into the cave line
That’s why we playing for tomorrow while today’s fine

[Verse 3]
If you ask me, I’m dying in the studio
Just play the last thing I was working on at my funeral
It’s not who you know, it’s what you do with what you have
We were out seizing the day while you were home puffin grass
Wait, that was me instead of you
Learning from the things I always plan but never do
Nope, that was you instead of me
Believe me you don’t want me as a true celebrity
Because I'll start tellin’ the people they never needed the
Record labels, politics, gods, or corporate media
They know they’ll have to answer things when I come in
How many ideas stolen from a slave or a woman?
Why are you still making a big deal when the blunt’s lit?
You wouldn't raise a fuss if it was another substance
So just quit. Adjust and relate
I feel like this is all stuff that I learned too late
But...

[Hook]
We grow too old soon, and too late wise
Useful lives full trying to escape time
A few remain just to hang with the great minds
The most insane work and strain ‘til it’s break time

You remain claimless, I’m a stake mine
I didn't become famous, it became mine
I aimed to have my story carved into the cave line
That’s why we playin for tomorrow while today’s fine
