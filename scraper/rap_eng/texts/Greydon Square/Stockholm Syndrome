Your holy books inspire hate despair and drama
If your god does love you I hope you make him wear a condom
People think with prayer they're safe in the streets
Fredrick Douglass didn't become free until he prayed with his feet
You can tell that hell and god are man made
They both want unquestioned authority and demand slaves
And any incarnation of slavery's not good
So from here we can deduce Stockholm Syndrome is not hood
But it gets deeper than this
Especially when people get pissed
When you point out their deity's nature and even intent
But I'll never worship anything with evil in it
Especially something who allowed evil to even exist
I don't give a shit if he created me
That don't give him the right to commit genocide with pride and act crazily
His abused and neglected claim this crooked biz
If this was Cali DCFS would have came and took his kids
Belief is so important that if you don't you go to hell
Without the type of proof you'd need in court to avoid a jail
Give me the gas can and send me I don't need the drawers (underwear)
All because I can't fathom how your god doesn't need a cause

(Chorus)
I don't know about you but this looks like imprisonment
Whats worse is that the prisoners don't know that they're prisoners
Even defend the tactics that are used to imprison them
You're a conquered mind sent to conquer other minds selling: "Come and hear our truth"
I dont know about you but this looks like imprisonment
Whats worse is that the prisoners don't know that they're prisoners
Even defend the tactics that are used to imprison them
Another conquered mind trying to conquer other minds pleading: "Come and hear our truth"

Religious freedom is an oxymoron
None of them books scare me, not the Bible not the Qur'an
This is to Islam, and its fundamentalism:
The day you release your women, I'll quit releasing venom
Until then, no amount of scientific contributions
Could ever excuse your hateful chauvinistic institution
But, here's the real reason I'm not a Muslim
Children. See your anointed prophet used to fuck em
Listen, Mohammed was taking children as wives
One he married at six and consummated at nine
He was somewhere in his 50's trying to get in them drawers
She wasn't even 10 yet, still playing with dolls
So they try to give me that, "oh the times were different"
Rationalizing atrocities now you sound like Christians
I charge the views on women as sickening
Either update the culture or just fade into history
But either way...

(Chorus x2)
This looks like imprisonment
Whats worse is that the prisoners don't know that they're prisoners
Even defend the tactics that are used to imprison them
You're a conquered mind sent to conquer other minds selling: "Come and hear our truth"
I don't know about you but this looks like imprisonment
Whats worse is that the prisoners don't know that their prisoners
Even defend the tactics that are used to imprison them
Another conquered mind trying to conquer other minds pleading: "Come and hear our truth"
