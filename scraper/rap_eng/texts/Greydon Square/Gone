[Intro]
Yea, hopefully this'll explain a little bit better
Why I left, so abruptly
All it took was for somebody to ask why
You know? Look

[Verse 1]
It's been a nice ride
But like nice rides it comes to an end
So I'll step aside like the nice guy
They called my passion anger and then said that I was angry
But what it really was is the fact they couldn't contain me
Then they criticized my gang life
Then they said that I was a fundamentalist atheist in the same night
I keep my heat on my hip like I don't walk without it
And I've seen people get shot, but I don't talk about it
I live in the real world this ain't no fantasy
But I got your attention even if you ain't a fan of me
It's family that we all after
But now it's Greydon Square that has to close the chapter
Maybe someone look after everyone after I'm gone
I miss you all already
And for the record my name's not Greydon it's really Eddie
But I'ma keep it steady, yea I'ma keep it stompin'
How many quantum physics majors do you know from Compton?
See they expect me to fail, they expect me in jail
But they don't expect me to sell, that's why I stopped
But I'm not back on the block, I'm back in them books
Laughin' at crooks that's trying to swap a queen for a rook
And it only took four atheist nations and three babbles
Hopefully that was enough
I'm Greydon Square signin' off
Peace, love and happiness to everyone that's kind at heart
Much love to you all

[Hook]
It's just the same old thing that I go through every day
So maybe I'll stop now, I think I'll just stop now
Just look at how much of myself I gave away
So maybe I'll stop now, I think I'll just stop now

[Verse 2]
Yea, yea
I hope you people take my atheist nation and run wit it
Have fun wit it, until everything's done with it
And if you have an opinion make sure you come wit it
Some responded well to the videos and some didn't
I shouldn't have to defend myself from other atheists
I really thought that we were on the same side
After the blasphemy challenge, hell everything changed
I thought it was insane we were more divided than ever
But I pressed on and made a couple of more videos
Trying not to slug it out with silly foes
Then they said that I wasn't supporting other people
That I was doin' this and it was all about my ego
Are you serious? That's when I actually knew
That there was really nothing left to do
So I left
That's when I actually knew
That there was really nothing left to do
So I left

[Hook]
It's just the same old thing that I go through every day
So maybe I'll stop now, I think I'll just stop now
Just look at how much of myself I gave away
So maybe I'll stop now, I think I'll just stop now

[Outro: Spoken]
Ya know, when I did that song "Gone"
I actually did it with the, the full intention of not releasing any more music
Or doing any more "atheist nations", or anything like that
The funny thing about that song, though
Is that it ended up turning out to be the first song of this record that I actually completed
These next three songs though, I did before
In fact before I changed my name to "Greydon Square"
I had, I had written these songs. I wrote these songs, ya know
They're years old
In fact, "Dear Journal" is at least four years old
So, with that being said
I hope you guys enjoy 'em
They'll probably give you a different perspective about me
Besides the rigid, vigilant atheist, philosophical, ya know
Debater whatever the case may be
Than, you know, that you've gotten so far
So, I hope you guys enjoy it
I wanna specifically thank several people for making this possible:
Jason [?], Brian Sapient, Jeff Tosh, Antoine, Cedric, my mother Debra
So anyway, hopefully you guys enjoy it
And look out for The CPT Theorem
The next album in the trilogy
Talk to you later, peace
