[Intro]
Yea, Type 3
Check

[Verse 1]
Interdimensional council of Greys
How many versions of us have we found in this maze?
Puffin on haze we pass to each other
As quantum signature twins were passed, even brothers Somewhere in between this place and that
There’s a bridge that you couldn’t find on any map
The space between them no wider than a razor tip
But you’ll know the way by the marijuana from my layer scent Here we’ve got Hammers from Asgard
TARDIS booths, Borgs, Dale Earnhardt’s NASCAR
Blazing rhymes outside of space and time
Amazing finds 118 minds
We boogie board the cosmic shores
Looking for Wookie Lords and Girl Scout cookies for soil grows for the greenhouse
Boil oil and toil on cadence and B counts
My 616 Doppelgänger creeps down
He’ll send you back to Crenshaw peak make a peep now
From your reference you’ve been here before
But don’t know how you got here dimensions galore
What you think all the sick inventions is for?
Exploring from the tip of existence down to the floor, of course I’ve seen the rise and fall of every king
And found a single Omniverse and several everything’s

[Verse 2]
Interdimensional council of Greys
How many versions of us how we found in this maze?
Puffing on Haze we ponder our existence
No longer as a slave to time, space, and distance
I often forget that time doesn't pass here
You won't know if you came tomorrow or last year
Here I can exist and not exist
As a Greydon Square, Eddie Collins or Apocalypse
Keep your rocketship I'll take the Stargate
I was building my third while you was at the bar late
The infinity sign is my sigil
You rock a tiny stone I hold the M-Chron Crystal
Here the immortals try to rhyme to death
The only others who have access is beyond this left
Section 31 is banned like my worlds NSA, they really want a fan This is partly a ship you're on the skippers deck
Part supercomputer due for a systems check
Where's my assistant needed for every episode?
She has my notes on dual air correction codes

[Verse 3]
Interdimensional council of Greys
How many versions of us how we found in this maze?
So many ways to research an experiment
Plus DMT and weed to deeper the experience
Inter-dimensional Council of Grey’s
How many versions of us how we found in this place?
This is our base powered by a quasar
Where we control our own fates oblivion staved off

[Outro]
Interdimensional council of Greys
Interdimensional council of Greys
Interdimensional council of Greys
