[Skit: Man 1, (Man 2)]
... probability or atheism

Here's one of the reasons why I don't believe:
Imagine this story, about a man
Who's, I don't know, working in the field or something one day
(Yeah) And he starts to hear voices
What if you heard this story
I know this guy who started to hear voices
And the voices told him to kill his son, on top of a rock [laughing]
Bring your son to this hilltop, place him on a rock, and kill him
Uhh, okay, I'll do that (yeah, it's so absurd)
And then let's say this guy actually does that
And you're like "Woah, this guy is crazy!
I can't believe he's in the charge of children"
So then, (yeah) he's about to kill this boy
About to strike down and all of a sudden the voices are like
"Sike! Yeah, I don't want you to kill him
I just want you to rip the tip of his penis off"
(And you're like "oh, that's so much better
That makes perfect sense")
Oh my god, you must have created the universe!
Holy shit!
