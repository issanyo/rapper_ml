(Intro)
Microphone check 1...2...Ha Ha
Alright, this is the dopamine kata
Look
(Verse 1)
Global following, barely known locally
Training in the Force alone
...For more potency
A lyrical injection of fresh dopamine
...Impart verses with the depth of chest openings
On my way to the stage you won't notice me
...like an undiscovered Big Pun:
...That's pretty sobering
Labels don't want a Kunta
...They want to Toby me
Men feel it in their nuts
...Women in their ovaries
I'm right here in the paint for you to poster me
...But I'mma still go for the block
...That's how it's supposed to be
Spit gross while these drones pray the Rosary
...Extract alkaloid from my flows: like they were coca leaves
And with all the negotiating and brokering
...They never had a deal on me
...They never could have closed a thing
I was in Germany when they heard of me
...Nerdily spitting lyrics about deep time and short eternities
So what are you talking about
...the only thing you understand is stanky leg and walking it out
...the type of pitcher to balk on the mound
...we spit fluid , you got chalk in the mouth
Wack emcees be tossing them out
...Whether they come form the east, west, north or the south
They can get the proverbial verbal sword to the mouth if they got a problem
...We take man's biggest problems and try to solve them
Look: the model is changing, we aren't adapting fast enough
...We have solutions too but ain't no body asking us
Don't ask america cause we're to busy catching up
...Screaming up and down we're on top while others laugh at us
...And this ain't nothing to be be proud about
Take the silver spoon and rip it out of your mouth
...Give you something to pout about
You're just another carbon chemical structure
...in a star system with millions of others
You speak knowledge then I'm feeling you brother
...If not then you get from me nothing
This is a preemptive strike and you seem to be bluffing
...Kind of North Korean like, And you still won't do nothing

This is the dopamine kata, fresh dopamine. (Broken up as if a DJ scratched a record)
