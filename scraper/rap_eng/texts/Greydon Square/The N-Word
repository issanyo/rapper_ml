[Verse One]
Lyrically, they say what I do is a fad
You can’t keep spitting truth ‘cuz these fools will get mad
They don’t want you to get deep, they happy with bling
Wallow in ignorance as long as they stacking the green
Think I’m overstating my case? This is a fact
There’s a very strong line between niggas and blacks
See, niggas are followers, blacks normally lead
Niggas call blacks white washed soon as they on the scene
And the things about niggas, you can’t tell ‘em nothin’
Cuz they know every goddamn thing about something
See niggas hear blacks talk and say that they talk white
More ignorant than Michael Vick setting up dog fights
Saggin to they ankles, don’t care if they walk right
Would rather smoke and drink than see if they kids are alright
See niggas are attracted to niggas
Blacks are attracted to intelligence they don’t care what the skin is
See niggas use they skin as a crutch
As an excuse to be lazy as fuck
Not to get off of they butt
Niggas could care less about truth, they’d rather get their hair done
While blacks value knowledge, even if it scares ‘em

[Hook]
So this goes out to all my blacks and non-niggas
If they acting like a nigga then you call they ass a nigga
This goes out to all my whites and non-niggas
If they acting like a nigga then you call they ass a nigga
This goes out to my Latins and non-niggas
If they acting like a nigga, you call they ass a nigga
This goes out to my Asians and non-niggas
If they acting like a nigga, you call they ass a nigga

[Verse Two]
See niggas believe in god, black people don’t
Niggas ignore evidence that black people won’t
Niggas believe in god, black people don’t
Niggas ignore evidence that black people won’t
I had to say it twice so there wan’t no mistaken it
This too important to us not to put the race in it
Niggas have kids, don’t take care of ‘em
Niggas talk shit about black people because they scared of ‘em
Niggas get mad ‘cuz non-niggas use the word nigga
As soon as they get finished using the word nigga
And I don’t ever wanna hear that we have a right to say and they don’t
That we should respect this connotation, ‘cuz they won’t
These are the facts, we should respect that
The very reason we black
Has nothing to do with that
And which demand are we at?
It’s just a skin color stupid we need to move past

[Verse Three]
See blacks bite the bullet now and plan for the future
Niggas will smile now and cry later being stupid
Black will respect us, wonder why it’s taking so long
Niggas will call me an Uncle Tom for making this song
Blacks strive for better, a better life and better living
Niggas spend they whole lives trying to be better niggas
A nigga calls himself a real nigga, everyday
A black stays humble and learns from his mistakes
A nigga is never wrong and expects every break
A black knows that life ain’t free, do what it takes
A nigga think the world owes him
Just because he’s a nigga and it ain’t real until the world shows him
A black knows the world owes nothing, he knows the score
He knows he knows less and less about more and more
A nigga hates Common and think Will Smith is wack
And think club rap has the hottest lyrics on the map
A black respects people like Mos and Jill Scott
And won’t put themselves in a position to deal rock
A nigga blames white people for slavery
A black knows that it was Africans who sold blacks into slavery
But when it’s all said and done a nigga won’t even care
He’ll just say that’s just who he is and that it’s just a part of him
Cuz he’s a nigga
And he’s fine being a nigga
So when he dies don’t trip, it’s just one less nigga
