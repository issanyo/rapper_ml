[Intro]
What's a master who can't admit truth?
I find it kind of ironic that you call your show "The Way of the Master"
Ya'll want to attack little ol' me?
Little ol' Greydon Square, huh?
Okay, check it

[Verse 1]
You cowards want to attack?
Well baby it's on
But it won't be a pretty sight
Like old ladies in thongs
You think we runnin' and you dead wrong
We stayin' right here
Greydon Square the fundamentalist christian's nightmare
So who's right?
None of y'all is dead wrong
Unbelievably pig-headed, closed, and headstrong
Now they're alone
'Cause they ain't never gonna realize
That christianity has more holes than Spongebob
But that's cool
Take it on blind faith
As I promote Atheist Nation movies on Myspace
And don't hate
You fundies made it a success
It sucks less than that phony religion that sucks less
Now these Christians wanna try to reconvert me
Before that happened I'd join Neo-Nazi Germany
So go ahead, murder me bastard
'Cause I make Atheists come out the closet faster than Ted Haggard

[Hook]
Go' say that I lie
Go' say that I'm full of despise
They go' say that I'm ruinin' lives
But instead of what they go' say
Maybe you should listen to what they don't say
They go' say that they right
Go' say that they do it for god
They go' say that they changin' lives
But instead of what they go' say
Maybe you should listen to what they don't say

[Verse 2]
Look at me
Two fundie christian girlfriends later
I become the family household villain like Darth Vader
I'm the black Carl Sagan
Host of Atheist Nation
Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawking wrapped in one
It would take whatever god that you believe in to damn me
It can't be christianity that damages families
Oh it is, look how they indoctrinatin' these kids
Belief in Santa Claus for adults, that's what it is
Huh, the other day I watched Jesus Camp
God damn, and you can pick which god to damn
This little boy was talkin' bout how he was saved at five
'Cause he wanted so much better in his life
What the ford are you 8? 9? Is your rent sky high?
Did your wife leave you?
Whatchu know about bein' alive?
And what's worse: he teaches this to other kids
And if that ain't brainwashin then I don't know what is

[Hook]
Go' say that I lie
Go' say that I'm full of despise
They go' say that I'm ruinin' lives
But instead of what they go' say
Maybe you should listen to what they don't say
They go' say that they right
Go' say that they do it for god
They go' say that they changin' lives
But instead of what they go' say
Maybe you should listen to what they don't say

[Verse 3]
Look, I question everything
From the question of everything
Just like America, if it's freedom, then let it ring
The christians tell me that if I don't like it, get out
But you can send my black ass overseas no doubt
George Bush Senior says, we ain't even Americans
Tellin' us that our cause is B.S. like we're scared of him
Like those little boys scared of the reverend
That keeps on molestin' them
Sodomizing and sexin' them
And if you believe this planet's six thousand years old
Damn you stupid
And I really don't need nothin' to rhyme with that
That's a common fact
So fat, you can order fries with that, stupid
I wish one of these rappers would
Defend they faith on a track like it's actually hood
I'll take it there
Yup yup the name's Greydon Square
The hardest atheist and your grandmother's worst nightmare

[Hook x2]
Go' say that I lie
Go' say that I'm full of despise
They go' say that I'm ruinin' lives
But instead of what they go' say
Maybe you should listen to what they don't say
They go' say that they right
Go' say that they do it for god
They go' say that they changin' lives
But instead of what they go' say
Maybe you should listen to what they don't say
