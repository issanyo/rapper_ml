Every 311 trillion 40 billion years
I manifest, un-manifest, then reappear
This time around I'm 15 billion years old
From a place in the multiverse where reference points are zero
The only gods in this bitch are us
We are the species in the labs creating shit from dust
I can build a whole universe in C++
Delete the source code, in a repetitive series of cycles
You believe in virgin birth
Why can't you believe that I hack into the internet of a another universe's Earth?
Spit with reckless abandon
Describe my span the distance sandwiched between stars and exo-planets
Be prepared when you step into duel
Is life the rule of thumb or the exception to the rule?
Seems like an awful waste of space if it's just us
We still believe pages from when they were just making this shit up
And so we're clear that your thoughts are private class functions
In case the programming analogies haven't sunk in
I'll take you as far back as you can take it
Back when the space we currently occupy was ancient
Everything you ever knew of only happened on this one planet
Found out you evolved and jumped into a panic
For real witness the birth of homo sapiens offspring
Cyborgs destined to roam the stars like Star Scream
If God can be self-caused, so can the universe
Ya'll can't think anything yourself, you need a ruler first
My lyrics behave like particles and waves
Every field theory united on one page
Dogmatic faith is dying or dead already
The last remaining are telling us to get our weapons ready
Because I doubt they are going down without a fight
Them in the future is us in the dark without a light
You don't want me to tell you what battle's like
Life and death data relayed over globally positioned satellites
You don't know when it's going down so you travel light
It's easy to send troops if you believe in afterlife
If I have to erupt, you'll see the flash at night
Half the time I have half the mind to try to stab the mic
Human beings open sourced running updates
You might be living a simulation, define the substrate
You might as well adopt extropian principles
I always asked why until I was sent to the principal's
The likelihood of what they're trying to sell is miniscule
It's minimal, I just try to inform you in general
The counter arguments I hear are just pitiful
They just give us something else to reticule
Lyrically I'm sinning too
Oh yeah, that's what they say
Name any other emcees whose lyrics they debate
Turn it up, what the neighbors gonna say?
Before you listen to Grey, tuck your faith safe away in a safe
Because I'm coming for it
You gave your allegiance in exchange and got nothing for it
That's why it's so abhorrent
At first they knew they had to break the African women
She in-turn would break the African younglings
The result, we had to latch on to something
Keep the body, take the mind
Like soldiers training and breaking slaves in ancient times
Let's take a journey up the Kardashev scale
United type 2 resources building Dyson spheres
And I won't live to see it but it's nice to hear
Everybody who would have had the right to be there
That's why you frightened and scared
Your obsolete beliefs will die with you
And your grandchildren will simply outgrow the God issue
No longer taboo to touch religion
The only thing we need left is an uprising in Muslim women
