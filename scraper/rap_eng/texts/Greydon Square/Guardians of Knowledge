[Intro]
Whew Whew Whew Whew Whew Whew Whew
Whew Whew Whew Whew Whew Whew Whew
Yeah

[Verse 1: Greydon Square]
Fly pass as I light grass
On a flight craft, taking shots at your sky dad
You have the world on your iPad
In an age when you could still do time for a dime bag
Why ask, the only thing more dangerous than a question
Is its answer in my raps
They had these fools conditioned take it from me
I grew up and went to school in the system, basically
Fake victory and staged defeats that’s how they get you
Hide false wins inside the issues
I could break it down if they cared for naked sounds but they don’t
So fuck it let’s just go and take the town
Maybe those who discovered truths got sick and tired of being the ones hanging from a noose or lit on fire
(fuck that)
So they’ll just keep it to themselves then
Guardians of knowledge but we think of them as selfish

[Chorus]
We are the keepers the compendium
Waken to consume after sleep for a millennium
Moving back and forth between the sources like a pendulum
Advanced study offers open course to anyone (anybody)
We are who’s garden a repository
Guardians of knowledge while the rest of y’all are all conforming
The off protectors of the intellect, expanding projections of the inner track

[Verse 2: Syqnys]
Yeah
A man that always lies told me that he always lies
I stood immobilized with surprised opened eyes
The spirit of his words hit me like a Poltergeist
A paradox can open up a world you don’t realize
Now sit and get your lesson on infinite regression
You know you’ve won or you’ve lost if you quit the guessing
And if you say something true they’ll do the best to lessen what you said cause a lie'supposed to get attention
A lie lends itself nicely to its own dissection
Truth requires intellect and a bit of testing
You try to build your castle where the sand is made up of
Imagine made of facts or infer a collapse and aggravation
There’s nothing wrong with imagination
He likes the fire of our innovation and creation
But, if your foundation is made of that you making a mistake
And then he says congratulation on your graduation
(damn)

[Chorus]
We are the keepers the compendium
Waken to consume after sleep for a millennium
Moving back and forth between the sources like a pendulum
Advanced study offers open course to anyone (anybody)
We are who’s garden a repository
Guardians of knowledge while the rest of y’all are rocking for me
The off protectors of the intellect, expanding projections of the inner track

[Verse 3: Johnny Hoax]
(Check it out, uh)
I binge on information that stray from the norm
They’d rather spin cycle pop culture stay uninformed
With eyes stuck to the TV, sleep deprived species
Chemicals in your face drink this eat these
It’s troublesome when even the sheep are not like another one
Just another some who won’t see where I’m coming from
So I take the time to try and master the kung fu, they're causal
They settle for what passes as functional
Not concerned with what’s factual
Because real knowledge is taboo to those who wanna put something past you
I stay under my headphones and study the things less known
They would rather question the methods in which the best shown
Instrument of change feel the vibrations
No time wasted when you spend your time chasing inspiration
For social issues and innovation Mars mission and our future generations wow

[Chorus]
We are the keepers the compendium
Waken to consume after sleep for a millennium
Moving back and forth between the sources like a pendulum
Advanced study offers open course to anyone (anybody)
We are who’s garden a repository
Guardians of knowledge while the rest of y’all are rocking for me
The off protectors of the intellect, expanding projections of the inner track
