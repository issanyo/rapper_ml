[Intro]
This song is dedicated to all those people throughout human history
Who've lost their lives in the name of religion
But more specifically, this song is dedicated
To all those people throughout human history
Who've killed in the name of religion
Listen:

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a world with no gods at all
No separation, nobody taking sides at all
No Holocaust
No one indoctrinating our children
No religious fanatics flying planes into our buildings
Everybody playing in the game of life in which
They can't lose
Instead of killing for an invisible man they can't prove
Nobody dying over a book
No Crusades, no War on Terror headed by Bush
I'm dreaming of a world where there is no such place
As the Bible Belt
Instead of looking up you look inside yourself
And when you do find yourself you go help
Somebody else instead of praying you do well to maintain your body's health
Now that's what I call a dream
I'm just glad that I have one like Martin Luther King
Maybe this religion ain't really all that it seems
But it happened so until it ends I'ma keep rapping

[Hook]
I have a dream, dream, dream
My dream
Rational Response Squad
That's what I call a dream

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a world where a young little girl
Doesn't have to shake her ass at the class to get a referral
From a boy that she likes but she doesn't like herself
Thinking that that boy's like would help
I'm dreaming of a world without a religion that tells me
That I'm not good enough as soon as I'm born
That I need to be saved from a decision I didn't make
That I need to pay for a piece of fruit that I never ate
I'm dreaming of a better place
Than a city with roads paved with gold
With bigger pearls on better gates
And it all happens right here right now while I'm still rapping
And we keep it nice and tight like gift wrapping
I'm dreaming of a world where God doesn't hate the fags
Where manifest destiny says you have to take it back
Whatever you stole from whatever race whose owed anything
But mind you these are my dreams

[Hook]
I have a dream, dream, dream
My dream
Rational Response Squad
That's what I call a dream

[Verse 3]
My dream is that everybody can see this
Where we all carry knowledge around like Rich Rodriguez
[?], my dream is to be walkin' with Stephen Hawking
Right on the beach, talking theory
If y'all can hear me, we can make this come true
Instead of wondering what in the hell this world's come to
Instead of fighting wars for religion
We can give praise and makes lords of our children
I'm dreamin' of a world where nobody is suspect
Where Rational Response members doesn't get death threats
In fact, Rational Response Squad doesn't exist
'Cause there really is no need for it
My dream is peace and harmony around me
Nothing but tranquility and serene surroundings
And that's why you'll get nothing but the best stuff out me
'Cause all I really want is to make my dreams a reality

[Hook]
I have a dream, dream, dream
My dream
Rational Response Squad
That's what I call a dream

[Outro]
I love you guys
There ain't another group of people out there
Who I can just sit back and express myself to
And that's what this is really all about
Just gettin' all this stuff off my chest
Ya know?
You guys are like my own personal therapist
I just, just get out there man
Sometimes I'll read a lot of the emails that you guys send me
Man, and, how ironic that I would actually use this term
But I feel blessed to have such strong supporters as you guys
I would've never saw it coming
All those rappers that I see on TV
Talkin' about nothing
Eight, ten, twelve songs in a row talkin' about nothing
Man, and my people
We have a true relationship, I think
I'm always one click away
Ya know?
