[Intro]
Yea, the super gross Greydon Square
Hey yo, I love doing this
Forever, and ever, and ever
Hey yo, this is the CPT Theorem
Look

[Verse 1]
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall
I snatch them off and beat you in the face with them all
I keep on telling you that your religion sucks balls (yup)
A bunch of fairy tales that make no sense at all
How the hell am I supposed to acknowledge a soul and show it love
If you can't tell me where it is and what it does? (what?)
I'm tired of poking holes in your logic
I'm already getting paid for exposing your prophet
You ain't experienced hurt till you've been in a hearse
The mormons attacked first, they said my skin was a curse
So I started stepping up my status, letting them have it
Starting showing every single hypocritical passage (look)
Now they all mad cause Ted Haggard's in drag
In the back of his church secretly taking penis to ass
The deacon is mad, he's talking about leaving his mass
"I can't believe I would believe in that Jesus's ass"

[Chorus]
You wanna judge me
Before I open my mouth and pass judgement
Before you even know what it's bout'?
You wanna judge me?
Your mind's already made up
Even though the god you believe in was totally made-up
You wanna judge me?
But the rules don't apply
When you flip it all around and you open your eyes
You wanna judge me?
You claim you speakin' the truth
But when I wanna challenge it all you speak of is truce

[Verse 2]
I always hear about tolerant Christians
Who despise people for not following fiction
This is malediction
My name is Greydon Cubed, yes I'm the super-gross
The physics studying [?] religion super-foe
You have no idea what's stocked on my mind
I'll have you transformin' your arguments like Optimus Prime
Meanwhile freethinkers afraid to be seen
Coming out to friends and family like an AA meeting
"Hi my name is Greydon Square and I'm an atheist
They claim that I had a soul on this planning on saving it"
Yea right, and every other persuasive religion
Each with their own hell to help make my decision
So under your ten commandments just add one more addition
"Thou shalt not believe in bullshit"

[Chorus]
You wanna judge me
Before I open my mouth and pass judgement
Before you even know what it's bout'?
You wanna judge me?
Your mind's already made up
Even though the god you believe in was totally made-up
You wanna judge me?
But the rules don't apply
When you flip it all around and you open your eyes
You wanna judge me?
You claim you speakin' the truth
But when I wanna challenge it all you speak of is truce

[Verse 3]
It's kind of sickening I could read a Dr. Suess book to Tom Cruise
And scare him into joining my religion (punk)
You're not even a faith yet, you need more people
That I can see through, I'm rap's evil Lord Xenu
And you want me to seriously pay money to join your little pyramid scheme?
Super-gross, so stop the little rumors
If I was secretly lyingtologist you would know
I'm not even saying no more (uh-uh)
I'd leave right now if John Travolta wasn't playing the door
And people flock to this religion like an addiction
And told to have faith in addiction just like a religion
I'm sick of these liars
Their doctrine was written by a science-fiction writer
They don't even know it
He wrote it knowing when he wrote it that it was bogus, stupid
And you believed it, now you didn't believe it, you leased it

[Chorus](x2)
You wanna judge me
Before I open my mouth and pass judgement
Before you even know what it's bout'?
You wanna judge me?
Your mind's already made up
Even though the god you believe in was totally made-up
You wanna judge me?
But the rules don't apply
When you flip it all around and you open your eyes
You wanna judge me?
You claim you speakin' the truth
But when I wanna challenge it all you speak of is truce

You wanna judge me?
