[Intro]
A-yo
There was once a time
When everybody believed in at least some form of God
And religion ruled the world
It was called the Dark Ages (Ha-ha)
Look...

[Verse 1: Greydon]
They act like I set out to be famous
Talkin' out the anus
Then go on to describe my lyrics as heinous
It's funny how threatenin' the music is ain't it?
To the typical monotheisticly hypocritical ignoramus
I gives a damn what your name is
For all intent and purposes, you can remain nameless
Or have the same name as: Jesus, Buddha, Zeus, or Muhammad
Worshipin' every star in the sky, plus Halley's comet
"Why don't you believe in God?"
Why don't you believe in Ra? ("Huh?")
Why don't you turn to the East daily and pray to Allah? ("I don't know")
I'm just a guy speakin' the facts
If you don't like it, you can leave through the back
Creationism is a joke, and I'll leave it at that
Look at these so-called "down brothas"
Hell, I might as well be lookin' at they grandmothers
That's where they get it from anyways
Just brainwashed by the fear and the whip, like mini-slaves

[Hook: Greydon]
"It's 'cause they scared of the truth" (scared of the truth)
Yeah, that's why they attack us
Try to make up crap about us
"Because they scared of the truth" (scared of the truth)
Try to go song for song
When they jealous of us all along
"It's 'cause they scared of the truth" (scared of the truth)
Man, they don't want it with us
Bottom line, they just wanna be us
"Because they scared of the truth" (scared of the truth)
Take your mediocre songs and your kindergarten blogs and stuff

[Verse 2: Greydon]
Questions
How could your god be jealous if he was the only one?
How would we be his children with Jesus his only son?
There's just too many holes, but I'll leave you with this
If God was omni-benevolent, how could evil exist?
Let me break it down even further
Say I had a pound of salt
And I asked you within it, to find sugar (Okay)
Where would it come from?
If there was zero percent sugar content
Then logically you'd never find none
Teachin' logic to theists, you can forget it
'Cause no matter how far you dumb it down, they just don't get it
So I'll swear to God ("Which one?")
I don't care, pick one: Baal, Apophis, Anubis, hell how bout Krishna?
That I'll do whatever it takes to spread truth
And to, challenge everything that your god said do
My tongue is like the hammer of Thor
Nailin' your deity to a cross and askin' for more
Greydon Square

"It's 'cause they scared of the truth" (scared of the truth)
Yeah, that's why they attack us

"Because they scared of the truth" (scared of the truth)
Try to go song for song
When they jealous of us all along
"It's 'cause they scared of the truth" (scared of the truth)
Man, they don't want it with us
Bottom line, they just wanna be us

[Verse 3: Greydon]
"When you understand why you reject all other gods
You'll understand why I reject yours."
Stephen F. Roberts said that and I take it to heart
Think about it when I debate theist and take 'em apart
I'm a child of one lesser god
No superstitious bologna or moody, temper-mental invisible homies
If it exists, then show me
Not a book, written by man
With letters and words that's written by hand
("But the bible's God's inspired word.")
Prove it
Until you can prove the bible was divinely inspired, then it's useless
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
If you don't believe me, ask your reverend
Or cite precedent where faith wasn't involved
Until he does, we just gonna stop listenin' to y'all
'Cause you talkin' in circles...
We'll listen when you talk with a purpose
And that's real

[Hook: Greydon] (2x)
"It's 'cause they scared of the truth" (scared of the truth)
Yeah, that's why they attack us
Try to make us crap about us
"Because they scared of the truth" (scared of the truth)
Try to go song for song
When they jealous of us all along
"It's 'cause they scared of the truth" (scared of the truth)
Man, they don't want it with us
Bottom line, they just wanna be us
"Because they scared of the truth" (scared of the truth)
Take your mediocre songs and your kindergarten blogs and stuff

[Outro: Greydon]
Dedicated to you Candace!
Zachariah 13:3 King James, of course
"And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy
Then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him
Thou shall not live; for thou speaketh lies in the name of the LORD:
And his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through
When he prophesieth."
(Ha-ha-ha) Only problem with that is my father's dead and my mother wants
Nothing to do with me. I'm glad I created my own family
I'd be dead by now
