[Intro]
Yea, Imma make a few observations, just my own

[Verse 1]
We’re on an island of society in an ocean of nature
Where violence lives with poverty, hope is their neighbor
See there’s a disconnect, we think this planet owes us something
...actually believing to serve us is its only function
Our attitude towards it is too insane
Fools in pain residing on a target in a shooting range
What happens when we lose these comfortable conveniences
And fools can no longer live off the substance of the geniuses?
Fuck your vaginas and your penises, you both are hairless apes
Your frivolous differences are meaningless
You speak of danger and don’t even know how safe you are
Acting like a mass extinction cares about what race you are
Society coddles and lies for what’s “best”
Nature arrives wearing the disguise of your death
...we hit the lotto, in a universe uniquely hostile
While the attempted separation leaves the species hollowed

[Chorus]
...The subtle conflicts of the ages
Are problems we inherited from ancients unforeseen
And when the battle causes anguish
It’s often society versus nature underneath
...We love the comforts of community
But still treat the members amongst it brutally, then call for peace
There doesn’t have to be this friction
Should we obtain balance we’ll reach the mythic vaunted peak

[Verse 2]
Grotesque areas, where rest becomes wear enough
It’s perilous, nature isn’t supposed to be fair or just
You got that confused with society
The lies of piety, old sobriety
The notion you’re supposed to hire me
A tree of life in a forest of death
Upon a leaf that employs the duress
On a planetoid orbiting death
What’d you expect from the killing game?
The lioness showed up at the same time that your feelings came
Simple and plain, survival of the fittest ingrained
To be retained in the primitive’s brain
...your weakness will get weeded (out)
Even if you think it’s better off to be conceited
It’s undefeated, more confirms than the internet
...it’ll kill a vet like a sniper hits a simple silhouette
So imagine what it does to the clueless
The unprepared, and scared, ones who are truly foolish

[Chorus]
...The subtle conflicts of the ages
Are problems we inherited from ancients unforeseen
And when the battle causes anguish
It’s often society versus nature underneath
...We love the comforts of community
But still treat the members amongst it brutally, then call for peace
There doesn’t have to be this friction
Should we obtain balance we’ll reach the mythic vaunted peak

[Interlude]
It’s like it was, allows you to sort of - be transported back in time
That’s the sort of thing I’d like my grandkids to be able to do
Just to be able to, go the same place I went
Be able to see virtually what I saw

[Verse 3]
Nature in the interim, society in the interval
Maximum escapism, sobriety is the minimal
Intoxicated from the hubris
Over complicate our simple world as we misuse it
Society’s the nuisance
...trying to sell a game of rules and pretend
Where you can only own what you can defend
...Essence is large, the fact is you are small
Nature plays the referee, you arguing the calls
Intelligence lives, while ignorance is targeted
In a realm where you only have your will and wits to bargain with
Part of this is the cognitive dissonance
We experience knowing we’re born with death sentences
We’re less interested in reconnecting
Disrespect it, until it’s about to kill us to teach a lesson
...So lost in age we dismiss it
And forget that our place within is uniquely intrinsic

[Chorus]
...The subtle conflicts of the ages
Are problems we inherited from ancients unforeseen
And when the battle causes anguish
It’s often society versus nature underneath
...We love the comforts of community
But still treat the members amongst it brutally, then call for peace
There doesn’t have to be this friction
Should we obtain balance we’ll reach the mythic vaunted peak
