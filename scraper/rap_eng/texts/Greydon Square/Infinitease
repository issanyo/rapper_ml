[Verse 1]
Pi rhyme scheme
Locked in to sync with the siren’s dance
The fine line being
Subtle joy that she gives to the eyes and the pride but denies the hands
I find her glance
It screams for me, she knows I don’t care
Tension so thick it divides old air
Space in between, sole night shared
Intimate energies no type spared
...She leads me back like a deep book
...In my mind has her meathooks
Last minute second thoughts of the bush breach
Now I want it all like a street crook
Who needs protection, I want to get her pregnant
....Start a family with this limitless exception
Zero and the Transfinite, her next kin
She’s timeless, I couldn’t tell you where her head’s been

[Verse 2]
Truly uncomfortable numbers appear
I’m nearing one, you figure eight
You put that universe down and come here
It’s longing to bathe in our fevered embrace
Secrets of space, deep ends of time
Flows through your body and reaches the mind
The peace is sublime, you pull away
Both of us know that this tease is a crime
...Speak of divine, and she will remind you that you barely exist
By showing you countless deities already dead or dying in every abyss
Bevy of risk, medley of bliss
When she undulates it’s heavy intense
Sexy and fit, test me again
You’ll leave me satisfied very content

[Verse 3]
Get dug in this mobius strip club
Both know it isn’t love, it’s just lust
More exploratory action, kid stuff
Ravage you like a savage, injust
Feel the wrath of the passions pent up
Come to terms with our status, then fuss
Obtaining this kind of passage? Fringe luck
Climaxes, madness influx

[Bridge]
Tensions break, senses rage
Unhinged she slaves
In a way that would offend the greats
Literal take of the thinly draped, lemniscate
Bend or break, her favorite twist
Challenge her place, she’ll savor it
Crave intense, shame it ends
Speak when you want to embrace again

[Verse 4]
I look at you and find solace inside
Logic aside, bottomless all of the time
Lauded, calmly benign
Harmony hard to describe
Qualities, iterations to make Ptolemy cry
Launching me high
Constantly calling the mind
One with the Omni and I
All in a raunchy disguise
Honestly, multiply by you and problems arise
Us moving closer is always a lie
....Often a flaw in design
You shouldn’t even be talking to I‘s
I know infinities greater than you
You throw back at me a neighboring truth
Painfully rude
Then end up thanking me nude
What have you taken me to?
