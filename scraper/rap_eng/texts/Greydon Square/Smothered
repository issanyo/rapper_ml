[Verse 1: Greydon Square]
Face it, you know his type do not battle him
The greatest gift he'll give to his kids is not having them
Fuck an atheist, even if I am one
Liberals can kiss my ass, I'm keeping all my hand guns
Nobody's cool except GU
If you ain't used to soloing it's brutal when we breeze through
Do what you need to plunder my work uncover sequel while under a placebo searching for a haystack in a universe of needles
Convert a muon to electron with my ego
Without giving up the neutrino
Bust lethal
My flavor violates, the CPT scatter will make your eyes dilate, have the stomach and you can try a plate
Time and space is what you'll find behind the dying ape[?], but don't take it from me or the mouth of another lying ape
Grey's logic lays waste to the entire place, while evangelicals still threaten me with the fire lake

[Chorus: Greydon Square]
Am I the leader or the lead?
Just to hunt me down they'll put a sequel on my head, it's lethal
Maybe its cheaper pumping lead
If i fall off leave my among the dead with the smothered people
Rarely awake, they see if coming by then it's too late they only need my to seal someone's fate
So suffocate under the upper weight and become just another snuffed away

[Verse 2: Greydon Square]
My masculinity's intricate, it's how I have women asking me to be intimate
Meeting Rwandan women so feminine outside of hotels
My comments offended the nearest feminist, true story
Of course I'd wanna start from the top but it's too gory
The math'll do it for me
Think you ahead of me?
My rhyme intervals five times ten to the seventeenth
Deriding from extropy, so what you spit it weirder?
They gonna have to reflect upon what I speak cause I'mma send it through different mirrors
Lyrically fiercest on the issues, our resolution is gigapixel
I don't think we can get the picture clearer
My music *?* through different hoods
As the red threatens hell and the blue sells you victimhood
These rappers ain't gassed up they're gaseous
Full of ignorance tryna' down-class our saviness

[Chorus: Greydon Square]
Am I the leader or the lead?
Just to hunt me down they'll put a sequel on my head, it's lethal
Maybe its cheaper pumping lead
If i fall off leave my among the dead with the smothered people
Rarely awake, they see if coming by then it's too late they only need my to seal someone's fate
So suffocate under the upper weight and become just another snuffed away

[Verse 3: Greydon Square (Outro)]
Yeah, you chasing second place
I'm in the labs studying anti-symmetric waves
Randomly checking phase
All my uranium is weapons grade
Just in case it escalates several ways
Or the measurements never made
Heaven caved they've outsourced hitmen from hell
From my perspective just a difference in *(sell?)*
A decade of planning
It only takes a minute to fail
Where I'm from the lick they just hit it and bail
