[Hook]
Mind on my path; life's gonna test me
Gotta keep my focus; grind isn't sexy
But I wanna last; reminds me of a different time, don't it?
My whole entire being goes into this
I'm sacrificing all the time (but I wanna last)
Reminds me of a different time
Yea

[Verse 1]
I often think about an afterlife, or if the pastor's right
Am I a slave or the master-type?
Sometimes the programming's strong
You have to catch a glimpse of right just to notice the wrong
Bishops notice the pawns open for harm
Oblivious joking to songs
Token and calm, roamin' the farm
Typical cattle-ranch conditions
Fed a simple diet of wishes and contradictions
Of odd traditions. You hold onto them like they worth something
Showin' your faith only because you have to like the work function
Fear of being shunned and ostracized
Tossed aside, just because you know all of the profitize
Fraud and lies, the makeup of the savior traps
Stay and graze the facts and you'll wonder how you prayed to that
They stole your mind, we can help you take it back
Leavin' the way to on your favorite tracks

[Verse 2]
Leave the groupthink; their thoughts are just cluttered
And watch your complexity shift upwards
Everything we process now has to make us better
While tethered to a set of beliefs that we aim to sever
We just came to measure the deepest pains and pleasures
See a strange reefer strain, rearrange perspective
Peep the game
I'm inaccessible to weaker brains
But still got the chedda, and seized the fame
You were betrayed, lied to so you would behave
The rebel in your heart subdued through a page
Spooked and afraid, you grovel like a beaten dog
To even weaker gods, model when you speak of flawed
Logic and reason, sins they call "treason"
Recognize your hell and we all even
Godspeed, you can fall in the mass
I'm off in the lab, solving the math
Sparkin' the grass, pardon
