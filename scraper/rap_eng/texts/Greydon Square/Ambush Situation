[Intro]
I feel I was denied critical need-to-know information

[Verse 1: Greydon]
You misunderstand, we like the stupid
They fight to rue this
Everyone else thinks we're making priceless music
I write what cupids describe
Proof in a times
Cruising the music with a humanist vibe
You smell me?
I'll snatch the nostrils off your face and stare
With crazy flare, for not bumping Blue Picaso or Greydon Square
Time is ill, every day runnin' rhymin' hills
Swiping the bodies on the side when I have time to kill
Sign the bill if you're presidential
If not, your wackness gets multiplied exponential
If y'all play, then it's ball game all day
Parlaying bets often lost in the star gaze
It's our day in the sun, you throwing shade
Cause you hate the way our energy comes from solar rays
So scroll the page, show the stolen Pace car racin' through motorcades
Blowin' haze, coastin'

[Interlude]
Well, we're sorry
And it just changed all of a sudden
We would have warned you but they knocked out the radio tower
(What happened?)
Well, when the radios went out
I decided to return to the refinery
But in route, I find I'm in an ambush situation

[Verse 2: Blue Picaso]
And there's an artist, once the greatest on the planet
To share his view and passion was a gift, he never planned it
He's just a stand-in, a place where you can call your home
Landed on your feet, on the street with a microphone
The night was long, but the fight was sure to carry on
Everything he dreamed up, in spite of it he'd write a song
The light is gone, you'd hear it from a mile away
"We're going down" - only thing you heard the pilot say
And so you jump ship, and ran into the IRA
But you slipped and fell on some child down on aisle eight
The file date was written on the envelope
You know the wait is over, sittin' on the synagogue
The antidote is comin' into focus
My pedal long, bending flower into crocus
These bogus rappers, they will get no notice
I'm drawing strength in muddy water, perfect sleeping lotus

[Outro]
I smell a couple of thousand of these things
I dropped the first wave with semi-auto fire
But they just kept coming
Sheer luck, most of them were in front
So I just popped it into sixth wheel and ran 'em down
[Sigh], the ones that got on board I handled with
A combination of small-arms-fire and hand-to-hand technique
I am completely out of ammo
That's never happened to me before
