[Intro]
Yea, I don’t think they thought we’d climb the scale this quickly though
Ha, Type 3, okay
#GU forever! Yo

[Verse 1]
You know how they approach this stuff
Educate em, before the counter culture does
Intimidate em if they ever try tovulture us
Then we enslave em, with useless stuff and mortgages
The sum of our parts we are more than us
More than just haircuts chucks and gorgeous butts
Still we engage em, useless dialogue and such
Should we erase em? maybe they’ll engage us first
To be a nation we must get past our hatred curse
I served in the uniform and tasted dirt
With all different types and races grazing earth
Just looking for a way to get past our ancient hurt
This is type III abrasive like Spike Lee
You want to sit courtside better go do the right thing
See, i enlighten, i don’t care if they like me
I ask the hard questions i don’t care what it might bring
I’m here to make changes, you here for the sightseeing
...I only came to say, you and I, we’re light beings
So travel at the speed of it
Defy the laws and laugh at all the leadership
But make it so that even Vizzini can conceive of it

[Interlude]
Inconceivable, Princess Bride
Straight eighties baby, hahaha

[Chorus]
We feel good, and want you to feel good too
Get a drink, hit some weed, eat some good food
We want to put you in a good mood
This this the beach vacation in the room with the good view
Do good for others, see what good do
They don’t want us in the game. that’s alright we gon’ push through
Pass the kush fool, you trying to look cool
Let’s give these people here another lens to look through
Yea yea, another lens to look through
One mo’ time

[Verse 2]
You’ll need years to take it all in
From your peers’ perspective you’ll seem different when you call them
Another great leap syncopated to break beats
Take heed, watch the info escape the
Accretion disk of lyrics over the beat smith’s image
Placed in an region nobody reaches
Sure you were dope, but me i was a beat slut
And now you’re wack, your studies you didn’t keep up
Appease none be one and chief blunt
Each one teach one is something we want
Please taunt I need an excuse
To use excess energy on you that I leave in the booth
You seek for the truth, browsing through the fiction section
Crying wolf, you howling at a living legend
...my pen could write an iron book, you’re something i’m steppin in
Excrement, if it’s you facing me you’ll never win
Gross tactics, Duck just won't have yo wackness
You fuckin up the whole passion
The clashes are caused by ignorance
So does that mean peace is all up in my sentences?
Incident. if you mention “kick”
I’ll spit right on the spot, you’ll have to build a temple here
I’m the fifth element of hip hop personified
The other 4, comprise of my voice stay locked inside
Who’s kicked more information in the 2000’s
To start now you have to back listen two albums
I rhyme numbers like I rhyme words
One two, one two this 16 is like 9/3rds
Bringing triple the expected amount
I just want to rep the west and be out
Bringing triple the expected amount
I just want to rep the west and see out

[Interlude]
Hahaha, yea
I didn’t think it’d feel like this though
Grand Unified

[Chorus]
We feel good, and want you to feel good too
Get a drink, hit some weed, eat some good food
We want to put you in a good mood
This this the beach vacation in the room with the good view
Do good for others, see what good do
They don’t want us in the game, that’s alright, we gon’ push through
Pass the kush fool, you trying to look cool
Let’s give these people here another lens to look through

[Outro]
Yo, another lens to look through
Enjoy the view. We out
