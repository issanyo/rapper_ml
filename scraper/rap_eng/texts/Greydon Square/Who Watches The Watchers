[Intro: Richard Feynman]
I don't like honors
I'm appreciated for the work that I did
I don't need anything else
I don't think there's any sense to anything else
I don't see that it makes any point that someone in this Academy decides that this work is noble enough to receive a prize
I've already got the prize
The prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out
The observation that other people use it
Those are the real things

[Verse: Greydon Square]
Die Mr. [?] for your highness music
While the glory pious cries "center" while I deliver science to 'em
Dyin' humans wondering why I'm eyeing through 'em
I annoy 'em with truth, you get over by lying to 'em
Pay attention to the tensions buildin'
A state filled in a case statement punctuated by riddle killings
Simple drilling - you can reprogram anything
To hate the folks you should love and love the people you 'sposed to hate
Rassle(?) for real, tryin to lasso a meal
While the real gangsters live on Wall Street and Capitol Hill
For massive appeal the matrix is paper nation
It plays the patriots, better be willin' to fight when you face an Asian
Or take the safe with bargain for your propagation
Or find a hardened vehicle to escape in
From the battle of (?) to the modern-day surveillance apparatus
This is the mind native to the fascists
Our nation's struggle is culture-made
Pickin' carcasses like vultures came
The system numbed your heart like novacaine
You roll with lames that give "yes" praises and never challenge you
You'd be reduced back into star dust if I ever battled you
So imagine what that would do
If that fact applied to more than half of you
I guarantee the predators come after you
A dangerous anguish expressed through language
But never expected to hit targets unless you're aimin' at laymen
Expendability presumed by the generals
While back in civility I'll be viewed as the criminal
Thus with a nature I can bet on you to off me
Hell if you taught me but I'll never give you offspring
You'll have to take it, while you barely can tackle basics
An application of defending your castle placements
Miss me with the royalty-speak
My feelings on kings and queens will have you recoil at me
I think you spoiled, welcome to this senseless prison planet
Where the rules of acquisition are more useful than the ten commandments
Mismanage rich lands of thick cannabis on a slit of which each side abyss sandwiches
None of this is for now
This should be in a time capsule somewhere stuck in the ground
Free of consequences
Think it'd be easy to refine the senses
But common sense isn't so common for the non-attentive

[Chorus]
Who watches the watchers to be optimum authors?
We do! #GU! You ain't logically farther
If you ain't kickin' science, don't bother
We pushin' up against boundaries just to try move farther by thinking larger

Who watches the watchers to be optimum authors?
We do! #GU! You ain't logically farther
If you ain't kickin' science, don't bother
We pushin' up against boundaries just to try move farther by thinking larger

[Outro]
Ha, yeah
Grand Unified Theory
Scientifik on the beat
Scattering
Low tech to progeny
Txi hopefuls at the side of me
Reapers'll sow our soldiers that'll ride for me
Have it your way, I'll tear a tiny fabric in space
And lead your crew through an elaborate chase
