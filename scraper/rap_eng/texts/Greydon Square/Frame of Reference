[Intro]
Yea, I think there’s a common misconception that I don’t care or something
Nah, that’s not it. It’s just - I have a different reference point
That’s all, yea

[Chorus]
I wasn't raised, I was watched
My frame of reference is gangs, the pain, and the pot
...The gamesmanship the gain and the loss
Plus the indoctrination that came with the cost
...He wasn’t raised, he was watched
Another unwanted bane a lame didn’t want
...He was insane from the jump
Who questioned all and stayed at the front

[Verse 1]
Shot to fame, burdened with a toxic shame
I actually thought my only worth was to cock and aim
Old scars, relics of the old guard
And you wonder why this group home kid’s heart is so hard
No father or mom, a hostage of song locked in a bond
Of conflict and harm
I’m from the home of the “where you from?” culture
Where animals run in packs, while some come and vulture
You think they’re raging hell
I see a bunch of unwanted kids is trying to raise themselves
One flight away from bail, trying not become a statistic
Running from love, stuck with people hooked on punishing drugs
Summons, memories you would lock in your moral dungeon
Physically you’ll find me where shots are the normal function
Risky, I’m trying to cope with the loss of my family history
Yell my fuck biological parents to to shake the misery
And paint that vividly

[Chorus]
I wasn't raised, I was watched
My frame of reference is gangs, the pain, and the pot
...The gamesmanship the gain and the loss
Plus the indoctrination that came with the cost
...He wasn’t raised, he was watched
Another unwanted bane a lame didn’t want
...He was insane from the jump
Who questioned all and stayed at the front

[Verse 2]
I’m known to speak up for the silent few
Rising to, heights beyond brutal fights and child abuse
Dealing with cops, at war with the civilians
To sleeping on cots in Iraq destroying children
I’m trying to address the suffering of the voiceless
The poisons of non-education and poor choices
My crazed past is a basic model of frame dragging
Distorting the space and time around when I relay the madness
Insane passion, deranged package
The same patterns, fear of abandonment was the main factor
...a throwaway baby apparently
I might have went to Harvard or Yale with a little parenting
It’s hard to tell, I might have influenced a larger scale
Of hardened males, dying slowly losing their hearts in jail
A favor owed to the shade of nature that brought me up
Now my prime defensive mechanism is to hardly love
It’s probably cuz

[Chorus]
I wasn't raised, I was watched
My frame of reference is gangs, the pain, and the pot
...The gamesmanship the gain and the loss
Plus the indoctrination that came with the cost
...He wasn’t raised, he was watched
Another unwanted bane a lame didn’t want
...He was insane from the jump
Who questioned all and stayed at the front
