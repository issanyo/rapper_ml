[Intro]
Yea, my mission statement
Yo

[Verse 1]
We can test the illogical, pseudo-philosophical
Stuff that ain't possible, not even probable
With logic used as an obstacle
Hell yeah, I've said it before
Cut your beliefs into pieces and leave it dead at the door
I love how the gods used to live in the mountains
And when we moved to mountains and never found 'em
Then they want to move to the sky
Then we move to the sky, but we didn't find 'em there and you wondering why
Cause gods were nothing more than ploys under disguise
And you wanna despise truth over liars?
I'm still the black Carl Sagan, expose the fraud of Christianity that's all pagan
Dissect it all, and spit it back to all, amen
With absolutely no systematic interpretation
So while you hatin', making up stuff
Like Greydon's praying to Satan
You look like a chump, with little to no education
I never lost faith, I just gained enough education to rub in your face
Now you wanna go and treat me like a man in disgrace
And do anything to damage my name?
Where's god? Where's god's god?
Where's god's god's god when you're broke and out of a job?
Who the hell you talkin' to when you talk to the sky?
Is it Jesus, Yahweh, or your homie Allah?
It's funny, they say I live my life as a crook
When they got illiterate merchants that's writing they books

[Bridge]
Mmm. Ya

[Verse 2]
Late night training missions
Teaching us how to kill, drill sergeants drill it into your grill
Nineteen years old, and likely as bold
To throw a grenade in front of someone just to watch it explode
Ain't nothing about the past is sexy
I spent most of my life tryin'a get people to respect me
I'm a group home kid, a product of the system and look what it did
I swear to whatever god you believe in I had tears in my eye
When I wrote this. My emotions relive in my focus
The first song I ever wrote was "Misery"
Was called "Misery", and involved my history
I keep having dreams that I died in prison
All because I witnessed beatings in Maclaren's children's center
My mission statement
