[Intro]
Look, the product of God, Nala, was solved when I spit molotov
But honestly now, they say that I ain't got it all
They heard the new album and took so much Tylenol
Cause the headache I gave was too strong for Aspirin to fight it off

[Verse]
Now the people question it all
What is God? Where is he now?
Which one is the law?
Why did they not see the holes in religion before?
Like betting your children on a game and you missing the score
Threats don't work, I've been threatened before
The theists ain't playing, they preparing for war
George is on his way out the door
And he's gon take as many people as he can on his way out, for sure
Last time it was black and white, believe or you don't
This time it's simple, you either think or you don't
You leave or you won't
Choose to continue the rules
Move in a direction progression that many would lose
Lives over a god they can't prove
And losing their mind over the ties they can't lose
Now they say I support terrorists
That I'm anti-American, like I'm burning American flags in front of my caravan
But this is the same anti-American that you gave the security clearance
Back when it was War on Terrorists
Now I'm catching flak from African-Americans
Cause I told them Jehovah wasn't their natural heritage
It's imperative they'll disclose the whole narrative
But sad to learn it from a 26 year-old heretic
Children of slaves raised to believe in the same god
That their great-grandparents' slave-owners made
You've been played G
So before you think how to save me
You should check out what your Bible has to say about slavery
Leviticus 25th, 40-46
Not only does it condone but really it encourages it
This is nothing, I really could go on for days
This is what the South held up when they fought to keep they slaves
Are you serious? You think I'm making this up?
Descendent of a slave, and you think I'm taking this up?
What, what in the butt-stuff do you Catholic priests
Pedophiles not understand why I'm making it tough
This is nuts, now the muslims jumpin' outta they chair
Cause the Koran is hypocrisy leakin' out of its ear
This is the fundamental symmetry of physical law
Under the charged pair of time leaking changing involved
This is the CPT-Theorem
Like The Compton Effect, another example of cause-and-effect
This is the CPT-Theorem
