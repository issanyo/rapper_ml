This is my proof of concept
To show you hip hop can be more than just bullshit and repetitive nonsense
This is my proof of concept
My proof of concept

[Verse 1]
I love being associated with nerdcore
Cause the nerdier they say that I get; I learn more
And if I never see a million dollars thats fine
As long as my family's taken care of when I flat line
Same old rappers standing there waiting to shoot ya
Stuck in the past and stand in the way of the future
I grew up to be exactly what I wanted
When I suited up for the army and left California
I spit it for mindless drones that don't get it yet
Insects that aren't aware of a greater intellect
My music will live on in fossils like the barnacle
I gave the universe all of its exotic particles
It's not my fault if they ain't smart enough to get this shit
I spit bars just to get reactions out of physicists
Before an emcee I'm a hip hop head
And I'll quit before I ever say that hip hop's dead
I try to listen to these new cats, I can't take it
They make less sense than Kent Hovind's dissertation
Can't even make it through one song without sayin'
Something about pimpin' a broad or what they're makin'
Look, its Greydon Square I ain't the crook
I'm the one tellin the Fed Reserve to open their books
We can catch em if you know where to look
These greedy bastards and their holdings for sure
Just resist the allure

[Verse 2]
I treat knowledge like drunks do last beers
I read more in day than you've read in the last year
Get the paper? Naw, Imma get this information
Then spit it back to these kids and try to lift this nation
...we are the result of what the big bang was
You don't even understand the mind is what the brain does
They stop listening when the spins became for sale
Now they want rappers that debate Huxley and Orwell
You already believe in old world funny tales
Why am I not surprised you believe the world will end in 2012
In a bloody hell of destruction and global cataclysm
Just as bad as seven year wars and Armageddonism
Your favorite rapper and camp prepare to mourn
Watch, as this whole hip hop planet gets terraformed
You need to review your purpose
Battle me, and all you'll really do doom your churches
I guarantee that you ain't ready for my superb verbiage, so kick back
Let me process the information and kick facts
And if they think with really what's out, I can't make it
The severity of the situation's been understated
It's Mr Pryor's joke, fuck em if they can't take it
Probably be as underrated as Master Ace is
I'm just another kid chasing greatness
That went the opposite way that Ma$e went
And I don't care if hip hop needs a face lift
It had too many chances that it wasted
You got to lay in bed if you make it
They don't even say shit, lyrics are so basic
Either they don't know that they're whack or they won't face it
