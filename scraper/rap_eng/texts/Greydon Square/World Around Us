[Verse 1]
The studio is my heaven's gate
You still want to be a rapper I want to be an intellectual heavyweight
This is not for the weak minded
This is for all the people with IQ's above 190
You want your brain picked? Come find me
You think you ready to battle my wit? Come try me
My reading lists consist of secular authors
To my fellow vets: respect and nothing but honor
I want to go into history with people still dissin' me
Compose my own symphony, roll the blunt, hit the weed
All I want you to do is expand your mind
Let it get lost in the sands of time
Not evolve? That's just asinine
You remain static
Do something long enough it changes your brain patterns
If I had to do it again, I would take the same route
And shit, I came from two mommies, look how I turned out

[Chorus]
We used to march the streets singing songs in protest
(To make better the world around us)
We fight the wars digitally now as lo-teks
(For those who can't do this without us)
Now we make music to educate and inform people
(To make better the world around us)
And we'll drop a sequel 'til every human is born equal
(For those who can't do this without us)

[Verse 2]
You ask me what I believe in, right?
You mean which superstition do I pick to help me sleep at night?
I don't see how you can lead that life
They take your mind, man, too steep that price
You didn't seek that christ
You were taught it
...And because you didn't know any better you bought it
You were never even a free agent up for auction
Testing the market, you just signed away your mind for a bargin'
No fuss and no arguing
...And this ain't no subliminal shot
I just wonder where we'd be if we didn't live in a box
...Most people do this because they want to be famous and stars
If these rappers read books I'd be out of a job
There's more information than our meat-wear brains can handle
I have to get a handle, life is an amazing sample
There's so much for us to learn, so much to do
A god? I should be able to put my trust in you
Thats what I believe

[Chorus]
We used to march the streets singing songs in protest
(To make better the world around us)
We fight the wars digitally now as lo-teks
(For those who can't do this without us)
Now we make music to educate and inform people
(To make better the world around us)
And we'll drop a sequel 'til every human is born equal
(For those who can't do this without us)

[Verse 3]
...I want to do this to expose the virgin birthin' scam
Lyrical serpent in the sand 'til the burqa's banned
Submit to a higher authority? The nerve of man
Trying interpret the nature of god like it's worth a damn
...We feel the need to worship
Because life's so precious, we feel it need needs a purpose
But then you have to ask is it even worth it?
To be told not to ask or peek between the curtains
When will you people learn children have no religion
And you shouldn't force them to be atheist or christian
We can nip this in the bud if we undoubtedly
Teach these kids not what to think but how to think
For all my sisters and brothers who aren't allowed to speak
I represent you with every rhyme that comes out of me
I hope every single mother I have is proud of me
And rather die for honor than live cowardly

[Chorus]
We used to march the streets singing songs in protest
(To make better the world around us)
We fight the wars digitally now as lo-teks
(For those who can't do this without us)
Now we make music to educate and inform people
(To make better the world around us)
And we'll drop a sequel 'til every human is born equal
(For those who can't do this without us)
