1, 2, 1, 2

[Hook]
You To Wong Foo
Me spit quark gluon soup
And of course still do Kung Fu
While you find a fool to run to
I grab the mic and 1,2,1,2

...You see some rule
To me a new roof to punch through
If it’s war, then you use Sun Tzu
Oh a mic? yea I use one too
It’s all about the 1, 2, 1, 2

[Verse 1]
No labels, no gods, no fables
If I ain't able to spit just put me in my grave hole
...I’m a free man
That’s why they call me a heathen
The reason? cause I like analytical thinking
This Mongolian beef with little seasoning
Get a piece then sit down and sink your teeth in
I’ll be the first to admit, that i’m not perfect
But if i spent my life making music it’ll be worth it
...and I don’t need a girl at all
Fuck pussy, I’d rather give the world a song
Label’s get the middle finger just as quick
I’m independent, let em try to touch my shit
If it was dope now it’s a crack habit
That’s why I’m back at it like everybody thinks I’m bad at it
Until this shit ends I’ll spit with vengeance
...shit on dope beats like old people do to Depends
You fawn over porches Armani and leather
While the strong nuclear force holds my rhyme scheme together
I’m sick with the flow like I live on a boat
You should track that pitiful rhyme behind a temporal cloak
...this kind of hip hop has a different approach
Instead of women and gold
It’s a victory pose
A statement against shit we oppose
If this was poker you couldn't bluff hard enough to get me to fold

[Hook]
...You seem confused
Just leave us to make tunes
Before we break you and ya lame crew
Give an inch and these chumps take two
That’s why we bust the 1, 2, 1, 2

Trust that we’ll meet up soon
You know ain't dope you snuck through
If it’s fuck us, then it’s fuck you
We tell to em to spit but then none do
They couldn't touch our 1, 2, 1, 2

[Verse 2]
Face the truth we’re just apes with nukes
A raging debate over faith ensues
Wait til they break the truce
While thinking you safe, watch em bring the drama straight to you
It’s too late with no time to react at all
Catch you sipping on a 40 watching basketball
This won't last at all
I just want to bring intellect to a jamming song
While they laugh at ya’ll
I teach checker players how to play chess
Teach a chess player Go while I’m blazing the sess
Now follow
You know it’s 2012 when your neighbors
See a black president and 5 white Lakers at Staples
Just leave me to my major
Keep everything else including your Christ savior
I’m still the type to fight for thy neighbor though
Cut through everything that I face like light sabers yo
...This is the old republic
...you better warn the public
Especially rappers with a swollen budget
Producers known to love it, when I kick the physics
...what you thought my whole career was about dissing Christians?
Ha you fell for the gambit
I drop hot shit like rocks that fell to the planet
...So don’t get popped dropped and shelled by the cannon
Where you standing, if you can’t spit then put ya man in

[Hook]
They fuss cause I threw up truth
Just, wait until GU comes through
With a new blunt for me to puff through
DMT or even mushrooms
I’m a crush the 1, 2, 1, 2

Rebuffed yet I get love too
Mix the old school with something new
Some don’t want it here yet some do
As far as me i don’t know about you
Forever rep the 1, 2, 1, 2

...You To Wong Foo
Me spit quark gluon soup
And of course still do Kung Fu
While you find a fool to run to
I grab the mic and 1,2,1,2

...You see some rule
To me a new roof to punch through
If it’s war, then you use sun tzu
Oh a mic? yea I use one too
It’s all about the 1, 2, 1, 2

Trust that we’ll meet up soon
You know ain't dope you snuck through
If it’s fuck us, then it’s fuck you
We tell to em to spit but then none do
They couldn't touch our 1, 2, 1, 2
