[Hook x2]
Metaphor swordsman
Split em with the chorus
Them i’m
Horse drilling em injecting them with some more venom
I’m forcing em
To learn scores of a portion of
The total knowledge that the universe has afforded

[Verse 1]
I make classic tracks without saving and then delete em
I throw my metaphors into space and then retrieve em
I make em think that they have a chance and then defeat em
Grand Unified inspires a higher thinking
Miles higher than the empire’s spire entire
Much colder than hagendaz breyers and dreyers
When I flow, I use perpetual motion to go
When I stop, those who witnessed say I’m reputable
We brought the wired mics, turntables with stickers on em
We took the Wu Tang Philosophy we and built upon it
When we form
Its like Von Nueman galactic swarm
Super intelligence attracted from every corner
Instructions how to reach em redacted on every forum
People leaving the planet faster than you can warn em
Flippin’ bosses birds, packing all their belongings
Me, I'll be launching from Compton California

[Verse 2]
Imagine a moment, you’re the thing that’s made of light
...from your perspective of speed, any where, zero time
We on to warp drives you still use propellers
How you intergalactic? you struggle with interstellar
...we’re barely scratching surface there’s no mistaking it
Cuz at the smallest scales no objects only relationships
I'm not a star I’m just another sun
Who can't finish a rhyme cause I'm too busy starting another one
If you think I've started I've just begun
All the stars in the sky I've labeled and numbered em
Even calculated the circumference
And mass of Gliese 721
All while I was locating another one
They brush you off cause you think ignorance is lovely
And love me because I promote system of discovery
….which isn't even legal in your country
You sneak it in and bump me
And secretly enjoy me like a junkie

[Verse 3]
I posit existence insular quanta
...an island of quantum energy we seem to be stuck on
I charge my attack like mid 90’s anime
Just in case you reach for the mic to blow your hand away
You don’t have enough time to chart the archives
And not nearly enough space to fit on your hard drive
I don’t use tiny words like the media
You think you know, then I send you back to Wikipedia
You mean you flow, i didn't even know you were inferior
You didn’t even broach my radar or my interior
Students of Wu Tang modern under a new name
Redefining music, while y’all just eat the poon-tang
...and see as how i’m Liu Kang, and you lame, do thank
That walking zombie you pray to you ain't
Facing me right now in mortal combat
Sport more than contact
So annoying should’ve worn a top hat
Your flow’s boring stop that, before your mamma hears you
...how is misrepresenting our culture not an issue
And that’s not to diss you
That’s an open question
And constitutes misuse
How you gonna respect it
They act like hip hop is over the message
And chose a necklace
Said yes to mainstream and said no to the essence
But in essence it’s what you ingested
And was left with
No longer a threat and marked off of the checklist
...for us a deathwish for them it’s a respite
As expected didn't take long to make the connection
It's Greydon
Who timed the pace to expand as fast as violent space
During inflation
For rhyming's sake
...when gamma rays go I fuel the burst
My newest verse was old during the early universe
Spewin flow at such hot temperatures got to cool em first
