[Intro]
It's real simple
On one side you have the ancient warrior race of beings that represent entropy
And on the other side you have an advanced race of beings that represent extropy
You know sooner or later these forces will collide

[Verse 1: Tombstone]
For thousands of years we’ve suffered no peers
Equals or rivals, none of them can survive around here
We’ve bathed in the blood of enemies that threatened with malice
Impaled the heads of kings on spikes outside of their palace
Three entire civilizations we made them extinct
For trying to circumvent the balance they were gone in a blink
A bonafide galaxy buster, the Reaper Armada
So any nation breaking the rules and we’re coming to stomp ya
We are legion, manifestations of purest entropy
Entropic Empire annihilating infinity
We are not death and though those rumors persist
We are the things that make it possible for death to exist
These lower species are specks that we’re not bound to respect
We’d hardly notice them, even with our boots on their necks
The warrior class, we are the standard, the epitome
The masters of the massacre loyal to Lord Entropy

[Chorus](x2)
Two empires at polar opposite sides
Inevitability that a conflict arise
The deadliest armada determines who will survives
When worlds collide
When worlds collide

[Verse 2: Greydon Square]
Type 2.7 and ascending
My race crosses light years like they’re inches
It’s quite weird (yea)
With our gear we put the fear in the abstracts
Superior tech. Only adhere to the math facts
Past that? We’re masters of quadrivium
Exponential growth in the interim, few can match that
... Imperium for nearly a millennium
Peaceful race, but won't give in to anyone (nope)
... The upper echelon who bonds with the Lexicon
Experts in quintessence, assumptions of us are extra wrong
.. The ultimate expression of intelligence
If we can’t learn from it, it’s irrelevant
People of the measurement
Mentor of the species that are lesser than
In a thinking war, we expect to win
We personify extropy
Grey of Extropia will modify destiny
Without the fly weaponry

[Chorus](x2)
Two empires at polar opposite sides
Inevitability that a conflict arise
The deadliest armada determines who will survives
When worlds collide
When worlds collide
