[Verse 1: Greydon Square]
Rise in control, mining digital gold, grinding
Vibrant it’s sold, tyrants sit in the fold, spying
With technology, everything gets a makeover
Now watch these bank owners freak over a crypto takeover
....Dinosaurs call it a bubble
While their pensions are just piles of rubble
We knew of it’s value and so reacted bullishly
With regulators trying to control that which shouldn’t be
...Princes and CEOs dissin'
Who are now threatened by a type 1 currency circumvention
Only 6%’s hip, and it won't be only them
The homies buy up bitcoin, my money’s on electroneum
...This is censorship resistant
Nationless, decentralized, thriving outside the system
Value transfer usin’ blockchain tech
I want my people gettin cash through this and not their sets

[Chorus: Greydon Square]
This isn’t crypto versus fiat
...This is a missile versus sheetrock
Don’t miss the boat, cuz we not
We’re trying fund the future while you peacock
Dudes didn’t want to listen, now they eavesdrop

This isn’t crypto versus fiat
...This is a missile versus sheetrock
Don’t miss the boat, cuz we not
We’re trying fund the future while you peacock
Dudes didn’t want to listen, now they eavesdrop

[Verse 2: Iyosi Pydas]
The octo-screen, four-eyed market team
Trained at scalping, we target volatile streams
High octane on the cash exchange
Because we have a faster blockchain to grab the gains!
...Gatherin’ coin at the ladder points, compound and multiply
You can keep your trophy wives, and your hopeless lives
The fruits of your labor get pulverized so hold aside
Tremendous time and effort to ingest words
...Specified to upsurge your network and your net worth
Life hacks to fund all of my vices and commodities
React to losses by re-configuring properly
Marijuana smoking mathletes maturing profit trees
...Multiple renditions of unemotional decisions with bulk positions
Could change conditions in an instance
Learn what your risk is and know the business
...And in return lower the limits of whole re-sis-tance... or miss it

[Chorus: Greydon Square]
This isn’t crypto versus fiat
...This is a missile versus sheetrock
Don’t miss the boat, cuz we not
We’re trying fund the future while you peacock
Dudes didn’t want to listen, now they eavesdrop

This isn’t crypto versus fiat
...This is a missile versus sheetrock
Don’t miss the boat, cuz we not
We’re trying fund the future while you peacock
Dudes didn’t want to listen, now they eavesdrop

[Verse 3: Greydon Square]
Look...
This is internet in the 90’s
The horseless carriage, Frisco, in 1849
Claim it’s not a real, buy in to the fables
They don’t want to use it, they claim the value’s too unstable
Some of us get it, the foolish ones denounce
Nation States afraid it becomes the unit of account
Look at em shook, stressed with the mental angst
They recognize and respect its threat to the central banks
Ill base my whole flow off Satoshi Nakamoto
After I drop something epic i’m ghost without a photo
Peace! Deuces in the i8 coupe!
You’d never know me, or what I made when I came through
....Keep thinkin blockchain is a fad
Dismiss it as such and risk gettin caught up in the past
...And if you really thinkin’ you woke
Wait til people start using it vote
....Yo

[Chorus: Greydon Square]
This isn’t crypto versus fiat
...This is a missile versus sheetrock
Don’t miss the boat, cuz we not
We’re trying fund the future while you peacock
Dudes didn’t want to listen, now they eavesdrop

This isn’t crypto versus fiat
...This is a missile versus sheetrock
Don’t miss the boat, cuz we not
We’re trying fund the future while you peacock
Dudes didn’t want to listen, now they eavesdrop
