[Hook]
...You should never be surprised when you get attacked
You’ll know all the freedoms they took from you when you get em back
When in fact they were never yours to begin with
This is a prison planet you’re serving a life a sentence

[Verse 1]
Enter prisoner 092881
No particular kid of interest nobody’s great son
So he enters the system’s revolving door on day one
Comes out a menace the armed forces gave a gun
Sent him to war without warning him
The images he’d store from then on would now torture him
Brought his hyper awareness back to the rear
A soldier who still feels active missing half of his gear
Blood money they trade for his education
So he can learn to describe a state with one single equation
His idol Carl Sagan, his outlet hip hop
He wants to be a physicist, he wants to wreck shop
Sittin at the pawn shop watching the clock stuck
Technically a free man, but still feels locked up
As a result of social conditioning
He actually has something to say but no one is listening

[Hook x2]
...You should never be surprised when you get attacked
You’ll know all the freedoms they took from you when you get em back
When in fact they were never yours to begin with
This is a prison planet you’re serving a life a sentence

[Verse 2]
He’s institutionalized on two fronts
Deals with his PTSD with crude blunts
The civilian reality is too much
So much he hasn’t left his house in 2 months
His mood jumps from dealing with rude cunts
Attitude fronts and them asking to do brunch
Every morning wakes up from the same dream
His fate seems status quo, the same thing
With chains free to tight walk the fame beam
He sabotages all the success his name brings
...it’s the baggage of the guilt he walks around with
The psychological scarring you can’t heal with counseling
Feeling guilty bout the fact he actually made it
Wants among the greatest
While he shuns his medication
Munches education
While he punches on the pavement
Cuz he hates it
Imprisoned by the past he’s escapin’

[Hook x2]
...You should never be surprised when you get attacked

[Verse 3]
Another inmate who wallows in his misery
....the prison is his thoughts, the cell is his history
Watching as the world passes him by
With every plan to escape foiled he happens to try
Sabotaged, by himself. he’s the main saboteur
He’s the cellie he’s the warden he’s the guard at the door
...he looks at all his cell mates like their kin
...the guy he was fighting with the shank that was him
In the same crap as him
Just trying to see the outs
Equally as blind trying to lead each other out
...expecting every single opportunity to fall through
It's like being caged but you have the key somewhere on you
...and he’s tries to break the cycle but he can’t
There an unraised pent up rage he doesn’t get
...and for every him, a million just like him
Born of war, group homes, jails, and gang violence

[Hook x2]
