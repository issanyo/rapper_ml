[Intro]
Yea, E&E, yuh, check

[Verse 1: Greydon]
You think this universe is special don’t you
....the boolean rhymes I kick reflects the light like a mess of opals
Check the vocals, their makeup is of data
You listen and instantly want to take up for your savior
...but this isn’t even about that
It’s about escaping an ever-increasing mouse trap
Two states, with fate undetermined
Yet they both exist without a stake in the current
Maybe the present is a lesson in paradox
I’ll peek into the future just to see if it’s there or not
...study existics with the spliff lit
Lyrical wiz kid misfit, with a literal sixth sense
Get bent, for trying to break my symmetry
You couldn't defeat one if there were ten of me
Even if you had a century to prepare
...you’d still be lookin' up for a god like it’s meant to be there

[Chorus: Greydon]
Broken symmetry
Force decode with rogue telemetry
Continue to go with the flow of entropy though
Yea it’s different, a threat to uniformity
Existence was better when it was orderly

Broken symmetry
Force decode with rogue telemetry
Continue to go with the flow of entropy though
Yea it’s different, a threat to uniformity
Existence was better when it was orderly

[Verse 2: Greydon]
Blaze the freshest
The space we stay in is asymmetric
Explore the decay with ancient methods
... I came to wreck it
Force feeding you physics within it
I want to go far beyond entropy limits
Overload your sensory inputs
Throw bars a ridiculous distance
From the pillars of wisdom
A long tradition of strong predictive
Songs of interest, where only the facts belong in sentence
...symmetrically appealing though
I'll wreck it with this feeling from the get go to the ceiling
With flows... so precarious and arrogant, lifted with the airiest
But condemned cause I spit about invariance
Test me and compete
You and your chief
Can both lay with the dead deities at my feet
We’re just the finite seeking infinite life
As we soar through space at a percentage of light

[Chorus: Greydon]
Broken symmetry
Force decode with rogue telemetry
Continue to go with the flow of entropy though
Yea it’s different, a threat to uniformity
Existence was better when it was orderly

Broken symmetry
Force decode with rogue telemetry
Continue to go with the flow of entropy though
Yea it’s different, a threat to uniformity
Existence was better when it was orderly

[Verse 3: Tombstone]
The only thing that’s permanent is the state of impermanence
So many aren’t aware of this and think that they can swerve from it
The nerve of them, the utter hubris is kind of humorous
But stupid does... the exact opposite of the studious
Lesser biological units nothing but specks to me
Of momentary interest then get stored in the directory
Their entire species' history makes up a fragment of my memory
I’ve forgotten more than they will ever be
They think so linear our thoughts are never similar
The things they think are massive are to me a small perimeter
So everything around them eventually has to pass away
They’re closed system's slowly succumbing to forces of decay
Universal deconstruction leads to everything’s destruction
Thoughts of stopping this cycle will only start to be corrupting
To me it means nothing, I’m jumping from this universe
Returning to the void and on the hunt for something new to search

[Chorus: Greydon]
Broken symmetry
Force decode with rogue telemetry
Continue to go with the flow of entropy though
Yea it’s different, a threat to uniformity
Existence was better when it was orderly

Broken symmetry
Force decode with rogue telemetry
Continue to go with the flow of entropy though
Yea it’s different, a threat to uniformity
Existence was better when it was orderly
