[Intro]
Yea, you didn't think I was going to leave with that one, huh?
Yep. Look

[Verse 1]
Name another MC unwelcome in a church
But if he ever shows up they'll stuff him in a hearse
Drive his ass away, funeral reverse
All because I spit shit that hits them where it hurts
They know I'll just stand up, go lyrically berserk
Whether it's either that, or physically assert
That you don't need no master, you were free at birth
And damn the bastard that didn't let you see it first
Weird research, the gravitational effects of two suns
We found the missing links, they kept inventing new ones
Now it's all lying pseudoscience
Who gon' lie down in the den with the lions?
Me. If you ever wanna debate me then try and see
Call up your local radio station and ask for me
Make sure you have all the pre-approval of faculty
Otherwise you might not understand it
Anti-Injustice Movement, we're here to liberate the damn planet
And we don't need a grandstanding
We do it because it's right, you troll because you can't stand it
We don't need your god, keep allah
We're for the separation of church and state
Damn Sharia law
And you'll never live to see us fall
Only die like humans while our message of freedom lives on
Either get knowledge or get gone
Keep getting shit on by the church of Islam
Ask them to share all the wealth they sit on
They'll laugh in your face, and either hand you a bible or koran
...Turns out freedom of speech is the worst offense
...Our purpose is to peek under the circus tent
They won't let us; then want to take over the world
We won't let em; this is about one love for all
We won't let up; until all the injustice is gone
We all fed up; you are not, are not alone
We all together; this the theme song for the fight
So go get em
