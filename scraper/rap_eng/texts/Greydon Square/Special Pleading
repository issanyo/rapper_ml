[Verse 1]
Our kids should be reaching for the stars not ways to repent
Why is the age to choose religion less than the age of consent?
They knew to teach you when you were gullible “god is infallible”
Even though deep down inside it wasn’t as logical
Lie after lie they told you – pathological
You knew it didn’t make any sense; it wasn’t possible
Another oxymoron; religious education
Classes on unscientifically biased information
If god gives you a brain but doesn’t want you to think
Your god of gaps is no answer, he’s no missing link
He’s an abomination like catholic confirmation
The lesson is not to question or rise above your station
Bible classes catechisms and Hebrew schools
Some generations will follow anyone, even fools
Some claim to have the only truth; a monopoly
But the most ridiculous thing religion tells to us is quite possibly:

[Chorus]
“Put your trust in me, I won’t lead you wrong
Just put your trust in me, how can you go wrong?”
They keep telling us:
“Just put your trust in us.”
Keep telling us:
“We won’t lead you wrong.”
They keep telling us:
“Just put your trust in us.”
Keep telling us…

[Verse 2]
Front line political warfare, I done been there
They loan money into existence out of thin air
Capitalism means fuck you they’re gonna get theirs
Even if it means you die, they just sit there
Freedom and justice for the wealthy
Everybody else gets shafted and we think that this is healthy
Still on the reserve we just roam for acres
If you ain’t white and middle class they’ll need to see your papers
Democrat and republican – the same party
Rep the movement of the people, Fela Kuti’s calling
I think they only want to polarize sides to vocalize
That’ll change when we decide to mobilize
But as long as there’s money, then they can be bought
As long as they’re dummies they cannot be fought
They only want you as a drone playing your part
While the very leaders that mislead us stay the very same
They keep teaching us:

[Chorus]
“Put your trust in me, I won’t lead you wrong
Just put your trust in me, how can you go wrong?”
They keep telling us:
“Just put your trust in us.”
Keep telling us:
“We won’t lead you wrong.”
They keep telling us:
“Just put your trust in us.”
Keep telling us…

[Verse 3]
The labels make you think it’s fair game
They’ve never been on the side of the artist from the start
It’s a sham game
There’s a war on for your damn brain
And for the prize they throw everything at you; money and fame
There’s just some things money can’t change
So think about that before you go and sign your damn name
You should run soon as you see them
Remember, they need you more than you need them
Forget em
You can do this by your goddamn self
They ask you to sign a deal tell em I can’t help
This is for independent artists everywhere
Anyone who’s been screwed by a label or [?]
I suggest you boycott em forever to make it up
No more flippin of our free expression to make a buck
This is a moratorium on them enslaving us
Raping us
Yet after all we learn about how corrupt they are, they keep begging us:

[Chorus]
“Put your trust in me, I won’t lead you wrong
Just put your trust in me, how can you go wrong?”
They keep telling us:
“Just put your trust in us.”
Keep telling us:
“We won’t lead you wrong.”
They keep telling us:
“Just put your trust in us.”
Keep telling us…
