[Intro: Greydon Square]
Yeah, Scattering
Yo, check

[Verse 1: Greydon Square]
Listen kids, school is out
Difference is the stupid loud children now move the crowds
Bitchin’ about who’s allowed - and who isn’t
Truly valueless citizens going to work screaming “down with the system!”
But bounded by the very same; the shooters can barely aim
But often will take shots at people they can rarely name
Therein the game lies the fix
I dare it to rain, leave your umbrellas, I insist
You interested? Or movin’ out?
Here we’ll shoot up a hookah lounge
Our duplicitous indivisive nature is too pronounced
Still lieu of mention, citizens aimin’ for true ascension
Perusin’ the main tenants while hooligans claim their innocence
Who really speaks for the denizens?
The Republican Bloods? The Democratic Crips and them?
I’ve been described as insensitive
Nah, just indifferent about the nature of laws and who invented them

[Chorus: Greydon Square]
Never mind the lies that they tell us
It’s those who can challenge lie with the sellers
(Even armed with a voice)
I think most of us just see next Tuesday
(Turn out)
I think most of us just see next Tuesday

Ever wonder why they embellish a system they bought
And crimes they inherit, as we starve for a choice
Because most of us just see next Tuesday
I think most of us just see -

[Verse 2: Greydon Square]
The things we want to vote for, we don’t get to
The illusion of choice is how they trick you
Pick an issue - lyrics are meant to inform, be critical
Information supplied to help you get you through the storm
These rappers played misusin’ rap
I slay ‘em along with these kleptocratic plutocrats
Just spewin’ facts
(?)Desires sincere - with intellect hypocrisy(?)
From where I peer we’ve never been a Democracy
Hope and change created targets in an open range
But both are the same and that’s regardless of where the soldiers aim
Hoeish fame - orifice for the highest bidder
Admit it - you only notice it when they buy a nigga
Try and figure who’s dying quicker
Lyin’ slicker, or want me in a box cause I’m eyein’ bigger
You act as if yours gets in it’s a game-changer
But my vote’s my own, the right and left is for gangbangers

[Chorus: Greydon Square]
Never mind the lies that they tell us
It’s those who can challenge lie with the sellers
(Even armed with a voice)
I think most of us just see next Tuesday
(Turn out)
I think most of us just see next Tuesday

Ever wonder why they embellish a system they bought
And crimes they inherit, as we starve for a choice
Because most of us just see next Tuesday
(Included!)
I think most of us just see -

[Verse 3: Greydon Square]
Where I’m from, Black lives never mattered
Tell ‘em to look at stats and watch their glass eye shatter
Past-time servants scream “fuck the police” to then find that it’s inverted
Surprise, it’s a circus (Surprise!)
This constitution's not intended for you!
They claim it a sword, while it more resembles a noose
The odds have always favored the house
They always knew that they could get to fixin’ if the game was in doubt
A path of slain brothers
Our voice cries one thing while our actions say another
Of course their play is covered
Then we act as if we need to be safe from others
The mothers ain’t raisin’ babies, babies are raising mothers
I’m targeted for my genitals, look at the choppin’ block
The fathers the most expendable harvested chosen mineral
Normally optimistic, pardon my cynicism
I think it stems from our lack of internal criticism

[Chorus: Greydon Square]
Never mind the lies that they tell us
It’s those who can challenge lie with the sellers
(Even armed with a voice)
I think most of us just see next Tuesday
(Turn out)
I think most of us just see next Tuesday

Ever wonder why they embellish a system they bought
And crimes they inherit, as we starve for a choice
Because most of us just see next Tuesday
(Included)
I think most of us just see next Tuesday
