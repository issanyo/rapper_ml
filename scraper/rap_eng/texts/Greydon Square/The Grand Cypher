[Intro: Greydon Square]
Yeah, progeny of the ancient so authentic grand unified theory
Dr. Feynman spark the lecture!

[Sample: Richard Feynman]
It’s no use arguing. I can’t argue it
I’m just trying to tell ya of why the scientific views that I have do have some effect
If you have all these theories of the different religions of all different theories about the thing...
Question, how do you find out if something's true?
Then you begin to wonder. Once you start doubting just like you’re supposed to doubt
You ask me is the science true?
You say no no we don’t know if it’s true

[Verse 1: Greydon Square]
Yo, listen dude
I got flow that you couldn’t measure with a pitot tube
Or a centrifuge
Interviews? I discuss all but hip hop
A trip to legendhood we could all make a pit stop
Fools miss it these quantum concepts are dualistic
The vast of Omni is too terrific
You think you coming tight
I’m into civilizations beyond number types
Puffin' the summer night
Studyin' somethin' like the primary function of light
Bust on the mics, some stuff that they want you to bite
I ever stop, padded cell and belts
And if I need a God I’ll ask myself for help (yeah)
Prayers to my larger ego
You couldn’t process the layers in my art Cathedral
You are hardly equal...
Master rhymer, pattern finder
Pass the grinder, or find your name in the assassin’s binder
Johnny

[Verse 2: Johnny Hoax]
Unh in the basement rap
For the ones that hate the blatant capitalist creation
That’s sacred we want to take it back
We've been living below the ground and speaking in code
No you can’t please us just because your visas are gold
We flow and blow smoke physically
You blow it metaphorically
Allegorically your style is stories, not our priority
I go forward with warriors in my corner that’s glorious
So these are the bars to bring the addicts back to euphorias you feel it?
Come check the balances accountants
No boundaries when you aiming for outer limits
In alternate realities
This is the intellect to split fact from fiction
To put past convictions in the trash, the bad religion
We are the cast and characters you oughta get to know
Lifers in the cypher, fire every episode
Meanwhile, on the other side of the spectrum
I suspect your quackery is unchecked
What comes next is never known

[Verse 3: Indefinite]
I write orders between loose leaf border lines
On the mic they're immortalized, grow fortified
At the speed of light passing border signs
Now a polished product before was a drawing board design
Spell intelligence with a capital i
Utilize computing power in the back of my eyes
Petabytes put to use within the night time
To sensory overload any adversaries with light spines
Plastered on trap beats bragging about light crimes
While I’m spitting across distance measured in light time
Nothing’s changed still representing the G U
From where I stand
Most of the genre’s artists are see-through
But ad hominem's a product of the basis mind
Far more interested in matters regarding space and time
I’ll be Grand Unified 'til the day I die
Scribe fire rhymes and make both sides of my mind collide

[Verse 4: MC Brooks]
I groove on this beat move smooth as a criminal
Cruise through loose leaf two sheets all original
Rhyme scheme make the time freeze
Like the white rabbit in Wonderland
You're undermanned against the mic grabbing Master Roshi[?]
With a massive rollie and his double cup of something
Tryin' to match the homie in his double Dutch
I'm in the zone like Sonic special stages with the emeralds
Tryin' to reach the pinnacle with dope lyricals
That'll pass the tests of time like old spirituals
And that shit you spit is so pitiful
Let it go, just to go, metal record flow
Professional tone with the microphone
You better know
Set in stone, my name is cause I work a metronome
Like a normal type
All I do is hold the mic and
Never pass it
It’s a classic from rap kids
Who feed on these beats like fat kids

[Verse 5: Lioness Saxa]
Unified
We keep it in rotation (yeah)
Fire to the bowls over Maxwell’s Equations
Catch the phrasing, natural blazing
Congratulations, your whole career is a fashion statement
Yeah, Saxa smooth on the track
School with the facts, teach these fools how to act
Classical, hit 'em with the field theory
Read it again, and you might see it real clearly
You should fear me, look at how you buggin'
Comin' at me sideways, a child's mind you stuck in (stuck in)
...Before you bring it to me, know that some of us aren't impressed by the way that you think
...Blunt rollin', mind forever growin'
Stomping out ignorance every time we put the flow in...
Motion measured by the observer
Brass get lost in this trauma tree love mergers

[Verse 6: C-Gats]
The enlightened clan is back
With lyrically scalp back illities[?]
Tracks are quantum leap
Through you writing these lame amateur raps
Damage the wack acts
He’s true to his craft
And I ain’t in it for the fame I’m just shooting the facts
Back at the world they should be giving out vests
I got a clip of cop killers if they did
That'll spit at your chest
And if you think I’m on some thug tip (huh?)
You're poor listeners
My metaphors are deep, y’all sleeping
I’m on ritalin killin'
No filler gorilla peel a banana theories got me weary
So if knowledge is a weapon better fear me
Imperial war vessels
Would appear where the sea meets
Run up on your beach with a squadron
Clear your weak fleet

[Verse 7: Eville]
I’m a complete bastard, see me on beats bragging
But I leave emcees, feets tagged up in meat wagons
Teeth chattering decreases and heat atmos-phere
Is bleak but I’m steep in the 'lite fabric (yeah)
Suckerproof Grey's puffin' on the Indo
Watching me dismantle you with muzzles on my pencil
Enough of being gentle, books stuffin' me with info
Come at me with the insults
And I'm huntin' through my steno
For [?]
I’ll leave your draw drop until your chin's broke
You're softer than a tiptoe, old-school when I flip flows
Your kinfolk, start the tape recorders and get in close
So simple when they pitch a phrase
Simpler to picture pages boring
That exchange is fallen when my nickel laid
So if it pays you're in chains you're a mental slave
But Grand Authentic is a sprint and we just win the race
It’s against the laws of physics that you get away

[Outro: Lawrence Krauss]
A interpretation of what these equations mean
How they apply to the world
That uh at first was regarded as very farfetched but I think has more and more
Caught the allegiance of the physics community is something called the many worlds interpretation
Which says that, yes, reality does contain all those possibilities but when you make a measurement
You find out which world you’re in. So the wave function contains many many worlds but when you make a measurement you discover which world you’re in and then there's no going back to other ones
