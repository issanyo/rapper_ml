[Chorus]
Ayo, you gotta use your "brains"
All I really asked of you is that you try to use your "brains"
Holy zombie jesus I'm coming for the "brains"
If you really want to battle me then you better use your "brains"
Yea, they think it's a game and fail to use their "brains"
On some lame outdated books, thats weighing down their "brains"
Even though the same teaches not to use your "brains"
That's insane, so here is just something else for your "brains"

[Verse 1]
There's a reason they teach it to you when your when your young
Cause a grown up asking for evidence isn't fun
Trying to explain how you should believe in the same dated creation
Myths
When you trying to convert someone
Name a faith that lets you think for self
I'll join tomorrow
That doesn't have a heaven or hell
Or promote sorrow
You mean to tell me you need someone else to tell you that slavery
Rape and murder is wrong?
I'll arm myself with "logic for dummies" books
Ten under each arm
Walk in the church and start servin em all (Here, read this)
No burnin' of crosses, or sick holocausts
Make em rewrite the bible with my verses in psalms
I tend to write better songs
Goddamn where does Eddie get off
Not just yours I mean every god
The lyrical rendition of Bill Maher's Religulous
I'm serious, religion is bullshit and we're sick of it
Now deal with it

[Chorus]
Ayo, you gotta use your "brains"
All I really asked of you is that you try to use your "brains"
Holy zombie jesus I'm coming for the "brains"
If you really want to battle me then you better use your "brains"
Yea, they think it's a game and fail to use their "brains"
On some lame outdated books, thats weighing down their "brains"
Even though the same teaches not to use your "brains"
Hide Mohammed cause you know im coming to pick his "brains"

[Verse 2]
Pull up next to someone and look over see who's bumpin'
You already dumb pyramid schemes dont need nothin
They look at me like oh shit Xenu's coming
Lets take a look at the facts to really see who's frontin
Like your god I drop bombs into active volcanoes
This isnt science at all I should snatch it from your label
The actors expect to see a return thats why they follow it
I'm a nerd they lucky I don't side with the Chanologists
Launch full a all-out attack on their domain name
And any rapper who'd believe crap to play the fame
Want to try and make his own religion Imma get em
Like a Muslim or a Christian, Scientologist or Wiccan
Keep spittin superior logic in the lyrics
I will personally rid em of thetan infested spirits
So there it is, welcome to religion
Where it's "thou shall not kill" unless they're different

[Chorus]
Ayo, you gotta use your "brains"
All I really asked of you is that you try to use your "brains"
Holy zombie jesus I'm coming for the "brains"
If you really want to battle me then you better use your "brains"
Yea, they think it's a game and fail to use their "brains"
On some lame outdated books, thats weighing down their "brains"
Even though the same teaches not to use your "brains"
That's insane, so here is just something else for your "brains"

[Verse 3]
Lyrical debate I'm a throw everything plus the sink
I'm black Atheist and there's more of us than you think
What'd you think that I would just sit up and just let you cheat
Never. As long as there's a beat
And a single breath in me
I'm a keep attacking
Every religious faction
Every single section
If I didn't mention yours then you get it next when..
I step to your reverend with them skeptic questions
A real teacher would've questioned the lesson
Wait a second just take a second to second guess it
What are the main lessons? pain, war, oppression
God can kill, do whatever he wants more or less and
Forget the moral questions it presents, obey without question
That's called "group think" it happens in Hip-Hop
Rappers change their style to fit with whatever shit's hot
And I didn't start the "us verses them" it was them
Ask them if its us versus them

[Chorus]
Ayo, you gotta use your "brains"
All I really asked of you is that you try to use your "brains"
Holy zombie jesus I'm coming for the "brains"
If you really want to battle me then you better use your "brains"
Yea, they think it's a game and fail to use their "brains"
On some lame outdated books, thats weighing down their "brains"
Even though the same teaches not to use your "brains"
That's insane, so here is just something else for your "brains"
