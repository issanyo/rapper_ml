[Verse 1: Greydon Square]
Touring still, with the sword and shield
For morbid thrills
Known for killing lords
With a quarter skill
And going ill
Fuck Caitlyn Jenner
That award belong to Lauren Hill
I slay beginners
Even though hiphop's on this blue-pill shit
Dude still spits
Slay a king in the open
And fools kneel quick
Fuck Allah in his righteousness
I could never serve him
If heaven consists of
Members of ISIS fucking virgins
But I'm another person
Religion of peace?
You lying through your turban
Vividly
The shit I speak'll make a feminist cringe
Him and his friends, remind 'em that this isn't pretend
Listen good
I've had it with this first world victimhood offense culture
Same plank to walk, different wood
Dare need a favor
Aryan invaders will ask
If you're carrying papers
Married to bankers
Call on you to celebrate a lazy creator
Then damn you for not accepting the savior
Soaring for glory
Ever-wrecking your shitty origin story
It's boringly corny
I spend the sermons normally yawning
Last mission? amass wisdom
Now it's spitting it in a way
To break the slave in a black christian
I can't peak, my lyrics they lead anions
I fill graveyards with the hindu and greek pantheons

[Verse 2: Tombstone Da Deadman]
Our climb is steady, rising high
You monkeys still want a messiah
Even if it comes in the form of a professional liar
The art of deception admired by the masses
Watch them cheer and go defend
The foot that's planted in their asses
All ya'll scared to smash shit, comfort in captivity
The clergy got'em faded, they cadence becomes a symphony
Spewing the mountain's litany, a bullshit rhetoric
Singalongs and prayers about freedom that you will never get
So what's the latest outrage?
Tell me who you angry wit
Post another twitter status
Only venom you will spit
That's probably why I remember shit
Cause everything about you weak
From politics to music you rocking
Even the words you speak
I'm supposed to buy into the shit that you spout
When you think sheep herders from Babel days
Have figured this out?
Man fuck that
Fall back I'm done coddling all your nonsense
Your lack of critical thinking
And little slave complex

[Verse 3: C Gats]
With all the pansy-talk continued by the offence
You people need to listen more before you cry, and talk less
While people lie in coffins you're lashing out at comedians
Devoting all their time and your resources to feeding them
Well real rapists, see killers, racists, and villains
In the place that you're building
But ain't the ones who changing your feelings? That's great
So channel energy on the actual threat
You say that Greydon raping tacos was an act of regret
Let's ask the taco if it's possible that he can repent
Ignore the context of the statement so that we can be next
To wave the flag for your agenda, please believe the intent
It's just irrelevant
We need to martyr people to death
My nigga, please
You're only feeding them lies, bare and deceit
Like it's a weapon of destruction, only blindin' the weak
No denying it's a cruel world and we're fighting the beast
But if our skin is not a thicker gauge, your body's a feast (????)

[Verse 4: Johnny Hoax]
In 2016, it's the plea to the populace
Please be less unformed or be less obvious
These followers would rather force religion into politics
Living the words of liars, salesmen
And forced scholarships
Send me to hell's gates, I'm sick of your stalemate
Without a [?] when you try to sell me a failsafe
Making sense of the world without the son of god
From every contrary department of Tom & Jerry christian commentary (listen)
And the chance of me staying silent?
As likely as finding Kat Williams in a science class
Research band in every church you ever ran in
Behind closed doors: closed minds, closed canons
Skeptic put the hand in his pockets
Here, studying topics
That would've made a jealous man of a prophet
With the flow
As dirty as any industry unregulated
Here they'd rather celebrate the uneducated

[Verse 4: Syqnys]
So I'm privileged?
Okay, I'll be the black pot
You can be the kettle
While you type on your laptop
Talking bout privilege
Bitch, you hit the jackpot
A first world citizen
King of the have-got
So I offend your silly ass, I'm still writing
Bitch, I took deGrasse from Neil Tyson
I told you I'm a black pot
You're a crackpot
In an ascot
The SJW mascot
Your worldview
Is a cloud of distortion
Always outraged
Blow shit out of proportion
You scream loud enough
And now it's important
There's real problems out there
But now we ignore them
So genocide, step aside
For the Jenner tide
Get rendered petrified
Every time I get online
Mad that I offend you?
Great, you can get in line
I'd shut my fucking mouth
But I might offend a mime
