[Intro]
...We ain’t such bad people
We just want to puff that weed smoke
Jump back, you gave up last sequel
Got plenty more in my vast depot
Trust that

[Verse 1]
Your flows are less lethal, metaphors less cheeky
You speak of dead people, we speak of dead species
Revel in bevel and slopes
While your favorite emcee’s absolute best verse is about peddling dope
Heaven is broke as hell when compared to these golden bars
You welcome token gods with open arms
For me it’s slopes and arcs
Beef or war I play the soldier’s part
Poking hearts in the frozen dark
This for half zones and quarters we bake
...As we move from an orderly to disorderly state
Dumb people can only sort of relate
Dismissing the potential enormous change that an orphan could make
Choices and fates, it’s hard to interlock ‘em
While 1st world rappers claim they started from the bottom
I’m sure you did, they looking at me like “how dare you have the nerve to live”
As I play Copernicus, chillin with a perfect grin

[Chorus]
....I take the songs that I write and I sing for the record like it’s never been sung
You really expect me to run for the hills, hold my tongue when the reverend comes
I’m trying to grow and become the very best Greydon Square I could ever become
I wouldn’t care if I never blow, I guess a bad plan is better than none

[Verse 2]
...We never had the same goals
I studied more in case we ever had to change roles
Insane flows we aim at deranged foes
Then bought creation with the change owed
She came close, I told her she was better off without me
On a mission to prove wrong everyone who doubts me
See, i never said this was a good idea
Truth I fear, but i was always ready for it should i peer
Crazy amazingly brazen, maybe
Or maybe i’m an 80s crack baby, aging
Safety’s for the salary type
You can battle me on sight with any grapple you like
I’m smashing through mics
I don’t care if you can pay me
My creativity is going nowhere near the slavery
People always say to me “you should be more popular”
But that’s not solving for the fact it makes me think about the cost and worth
More and more, you don’t want me on the foreign tours
My music’s chloroform. What you want to pour it for?
...hip hop’s only isolationist
Trying to keep his profile low, all while trying to make a shift
...I found my purpose with this raw rhyme
Trying to create the best quadrilogy of all time
The fame ticket labels claim they lost mine
All because chose not to appeal to the small minds

[Chorus](x2)
....I take the songs that I write and I sing for the record like it’s never been sung
You really expect me to run for the hills, hold my tongue when the reverend comes
I’m trying to grow and become the very best Greydon Square I could ever become
I wouldn’t care if I never blow, I guess a bad plan is better than none

[Outro]
We have to do work by putting energy into something
To create the potential of our own future within that reference frame
