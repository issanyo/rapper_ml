[Intro]
Yeah
Scatterin'
Yo

[Verse 1: Greydon Square]
Weaponize sets of lies to a test survives
Extra high lest he die tryn' to flex for side
Etchin' rhymes forever in minds
Puttin' effort in lines
While they still think of space as separate from time

They try to take me from a place where I'm respected
I'd rather be covering quantum resurrections
But ya'll would never rep' it
Often it's the cause of the concessions
All for me to devolve into the essence

Views get entangled
Performance is imbued with the strangle
I see it from a few different angles
It's plainly bullish you can see it through the grainy footage
You think they're bearish but in truth they're insanely bullish

The game be crooked
You want to win you hedge your bets
Do you do diligence and walk away with a hefty check
Without intelligence you'll never be threat
So train to study or be severed respect
Wrecked

[Chorus: Greydon Square]
I'd say I'd seen it all before
But that would mean I'd won the battle but had lost the war
It's challenging to offer more
To try to create something just to see it oft' ignored
It's tempting seeing us empty as we all seek to fill the void
Find the signal through noise
Or see all that we've built destroyed

[Verse 2: Greydon Square]
Crews will doubt the cause as not truly a salvage job
Just one of your thoughts contains the power of a thousand gods
Overloaded with info
Hoping you don't insult me for provokin' the simple

My opening four knights
My past course changes what I know to be foresight
It forces me forthright
How dare you bother me
While I try to map the ontological topography
To then explain it logically

Everything is possibly wrong, that's why we test
Checkers is too simplistic for song, that's why we chess
Lyrical guillotine so sharp you won't feel a thing
When I send you back to the reality of fields and strings

Higher order rhyme enforcer
It's said the truth I embed will impact you like a diving mortar
I try to slaughter
Every beat it's carnage, shield your son's hide your daughters
Who's bestin' me? (Who?)

[Chorus: Greydon Square]
I'd say I'd seen it all before
But that would mean I'd won the battle but had lost the war
It's challenging to offer more
To try to create something just to see it oft' ignored
It's tempting seeing us empty as we all seek to fill the void
Find the signal through noise
Or see all that we've built destroyed

[Verse 3: Greydon Square]
Isolated
Wonderin' if my mind can take it
Ponderin' on all the wondrous things I find amazin'
Time's are wasted wholly forgotten histories
Tryin' to find your place in it while hope is lost to mystery

Converging futures dictated by the past it seems
Tell me more the higher math intrigues
In the lab teaching class on strings
In our vastest dreams giving AGI to the last machines

Extropian art
I'm resigned to open your thoughts
While you just tryn' to get your opiates off
You opt to be static
My worldview is elastic
I drop the facts and get draw muhammad reactions

Nevermind the hype, this is life
Not some safe space
Dealing with their type isn't worth my cosmic base pay
Yeah I'm way baked
I stay it just to see them embrace their slave state
And watched as their love for the game became hate

[Chorus: Greydon Square]
I'd say I'd seen it all before
But that would mean I'd won the battle but had lost the war
It's challenging to offer more
To try to create something just to see it oft' ignored
It's tempting seeing us empty as we all seek to fill the void
Find the signal through noise
Or see all that we've built destroyed
