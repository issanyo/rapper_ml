[Intro]
Yea, ha
1, 2, Omniverse

[Chorus]
You want to seek the whole then let's do it the smart way
And deal with universes just as real as they are fake
To us this stuff is new
All while searching it for the truth
Even given the odds against it
Life is intrinsic
Where children love and friendships
Are swiped in an instant
But it’s another you
Just a pea in another stew
...Within in the greater omniverse

[Verse 1]
...The wave function never collapses
This idea would fall apart if ever it happened
Everettian rap shit
Irrevocably heading for medleys among the madness
Another bastion
Deep within reality’s ready state
A weakened Eddie waits
To be shaped into one of the thinking heavyweights
..But what about the one who didn’t?
What about the one me who was dumb enough to run from wisdom?
...Or secret life and mission
The me that died in Iraq, the he that fights in prison
Let’s peep the other side of decisions
Where the unchosen choices survive in a hilbert space
And thrive in the distance
Where I never spent a night in the system
Sights on ascension from the very start
Rife with intentions (yeah)
...While simultaneously rooted in prison
All existing in superposition

[Chorus]
You want to seek the whole then let's do it the smart way
And deal with universes just as real as they are fake
To us this stuff is new
All while searching it for the truth
Even given the odds against it
Life is intrinsic
Where children love and friendships
Are swiped in an instant
But it’s another you
Just a pea in another stew
...Within in the greater omniverse

[Verse 2]
...They say they want to battle me
Not knowing that they’re now dealing with quantum immortality
Look, in every world I spit it savagely
And only want to exist in realities they pass me the kush
This may have already happened
Or will happen again through this raw way of rappin’
On the skiff to wherever the splitting river weaves
Where my Deja Vu is simply glimpses of a different stream
...None of this is new
If one of them can be false then none of this is true
Paradox music involved every instance
Writing songs for the first time that I’ve already written
Listen, this is the literal situation
Pivotal ancients
Study every potential configuration
As just a branch on the tree
In a forest set on fire for a planet to see

[Chorus]
You want to seek the whole then let's do it the smart way
And deal with universes just as real as they are fake
To us this stuff is new
All while searching it for the truth
Even given the odds against it
Life is intrinsic
Where children love and friendships
Are swiped in an instant
But it’s another you
Just a pea in another stew
...Within in the greater omniverse

[Verse 3]
...Last up is decoherence
For people fearless
Of the non-intuitive features of neo-weirdness
The only logic flow where outcomes are orthogonal
Topological possibles you’re solving fo'
And you wonder why I smoke
Then look at equations like they’re solvable
Taking aim at the fundamental nature of the cosmic show
Opponents say it’s nonsense
Proponents make it known
They make a home where it ain’t common
On the fringes
Go on and skip it if it misses you
It’s a different view
If I was just as ignorant I would diss it too
But let’s not act like you can falsify
Now you’ve crossed the line
With an awkward lie
Reason tossed aside
That’ll cost you guy
Get spanked
Guppies gasp cause I’m leaving fissures in their fish tank
And they just faint
Just more detention for the prisoners in four dimensions
Their sordid existential tour's suspended

[Chorus]
You want to seek the whole then let's do it the smart way
And deal with universes just as real as they are fake
To us this stuff is new
All while searching it for the truth
Even given the odds against it
Life is intrinsic
Where children love and friendships
Are swiped in an instant
But it’s another you
Just a pea in another stew
...Within in the greater omniverse
