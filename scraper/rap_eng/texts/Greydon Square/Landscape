[Intro]
...I’m thinking about this conceit:
Knowing that there are these string models
Which are addressing these problems
These string models are predicting that other universes could be, could exist

[Verse 1]
Eternally inflated, I spent most of my early career learning to be hated
Journeying to greatness, so it should come as no surprise that I open eyes
Revoke disguise, and blow the minds of your chosen side
Frozen inside, exterior star surface
The only man that’s unafraid to slay a god’s purpose
...My genetic code stores my genius seven fold
While they compare you and your people to a vegetable
...They’ll say my later music was exotic
Ekpyrotic, one of the best who ever messed with logic
Test your knowledge, it’s worthless if you don’t
Learning that you were wrong is perfect when you smoke
Blown pot, destination known not
At home in the the early universe’s cold spot
...Checking my mixes in false vacuums
For lost baboons, if you miss it it’s all bad news

[Interlude]
...Inflation, and inflation in cosmology
These universes consist inflate out of vacuum fluctuations
Umm, I guess makes us think about other possible values of the fundamental constant
And of course that these have so-called “anthropic principles” as well comes in
Why the universe has the constants

[Verse 2]
Gawk at what’s possible
You have to close your eyelids to process the opticals
Progress is optimal, premises to suffer
Are our deeply held truths invented or discovered?
I’m interested in structure
...Rich and complex, the very type predictions inspect
Picture the next, classify existence in sets
...Procreating universes is intimate sex
Grab every book of life skim through the texts
...through the wall
Swear it’s unique cuz you’re involved due to gall
Remain ignorant and we’ll lose it all
Peruse the logs, searching for inconsistencies
Cosmos with similar pasts and different histories
...something amiss the mystery
Unintended, at once vision becomes the symphony
...all the realities are connected
And a loose landscape of the omni is what you’re left with

[Interlude]
So I suppose the multiverse, I mean there’s some interesting controversy
I mean I’d like to think that the multiverse sort of removes god
Which I’m quite happy to push it as much out of the way
I hate the idea of metaphysics coming into physics
So I’m rather attracted onto this scenario
Because it pushes those two things further apart

[Verse 3]
Quilted sets among the inflaton
Whisked along, reducings discographies to a simple song
So many different environments hidden inside of it
To find a bold mission of scientists
The mind screw is that physics seemed to be fine tuned
Something that creationists love to remind you
The nerve to try it without acknowledged observer bias
All because you think some word is righteous
Scaling rap flow within a self replicating fractal
The things that are seen are crazy astral
Unnerving deep ends that I learned to think in
Subverting non fixed physical laws in certain regions
Varied minima values, dimensions to house you
Aspects and features to count through
Fantastic arrangements of compactification
Trapped in the basement, patterns that predate the last iterations
Nothing really relates, so let’s just witness expansion and watch the symmetries break
For entropy’s sake, we slumber upon the beds of wonder
And ponder on how our native reality’s just a set of numbers
...this was always inhomogeneous
But still sacred like the spiral nature of the nautilus
My humble attempt to connect the bases
But they’ll degrade it
And forget all of this is purely speculation

[Outro]
The question is: what’s the mechanism by which the universe gets populated
With lots and lots and lots of different environments
For the mechanism that we’re mostly playing around with now
Is called “eternal inflation”, and basically I’ll tell you what it is
In the following simple way: there’s a landscape
A landscape means an energy landscape
It means a configuration space of some kind
Many many different possibilities
That gives you the possibilities that questions what brought them into reality
The key phrase that cosmologists and physicists
Like myself are thinking about is called “eternal inflation”
And it’s the idea the entire landscape, the entire landscape
Means all the possibilities will get populated
By this bubbling structure which eventually fills up
With essentially every possibility that could be there
