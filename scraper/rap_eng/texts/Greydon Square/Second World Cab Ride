[Intro: Greydon and (Cab Driver)]
Hola my friend
(como estamos ojala que bien)
How are you doing
(Aqui echandole duro de donde eres)
Me?
(Sí.)
Well -

[Verse: Greydon and (Cab Driver)]
I’m from the capital of first world problems
Issues? we’re convinced the third world caused them
Our banks too big to fail like it’s awesome
The hard crooks walk while we jail all the soft ones
Nerd blasting rap
Like Saddam’s ‘88 nerve gas attack that we supported
I’ve heard em laugh at that
While our top brass gathers all the data and facts to be distorted
(como Gortari)
...present it to the citizens in images
Position themselves to take advantage of their timidness
(Pinches politicos)
...now that you mention it
It’s kinda like how Dwight D. Eisenhower envisioned it
Listen here, i’d tell you to avoid it
But you might have to deal with them while looking for employment
Pharmaceutical companies cookin up the poisons
Suppress it cuz you look like you enjoy it
(Veneno)
And we expect privacy from agencies who despise us
Who know as long as they keep us comfortable we won't rise up
The right bluff, will have them promise changes
Making enemies, the same ones Obama angered
(Pero aqui esta el dinero)
...it’s kind of funny that you say that
It’s obvious they’ve been controlling the money since way back
Kind of like in your country
The money funnels through a couple of monkeys
While the people are up shit’s creek wondering
How their leaders live with such a disconnect
The poorest are humiliated just to get respect
Complete with neglect
Fuck you if you sleep on the steps
Even the best
Won’t trust you until they see the check
(Oficiales corrupts)
Which i guess is in the mail
As a down payment on bail to get you out of jail
For the weed charge
While others file bankruptcy in the ER
In a country full of deep scars
Dream shards, weak stars and cheap cars
That had the nerve to spend over a trillion on each war
(pero no nos intimidan )
...But we’re a threat to them
So much so, you could get detention that never ends
I often ask if were we ever in
Or if it was something they just told the gullible as they petted them
On the head (Aqui)
Yup, a left up ahead
It’s like more is implied the less something’s said (Es lo mismo)
I appreciate the conversation (No Es nada yo tanbien)
Yea, but neither of us had an obligation
...I know i’m not as famous
But thanks your time and the ride
And I hope we never bomb your nation
