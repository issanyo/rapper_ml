In lyrical debate I’m ah throw everything plus the sink
I’m a black atheist and there’s more of us then you think
Whadja think? That I would just sit up and just let you cheat?
Never as long as there’s a be a single breath in me
Imma keep attacking, every religious faction
Every single section. If I didn’t mention yours
Every missed rapture, every single infection
If I fail to mention yours then you’ll get it next thing

[Verse 1: Greydon]
Check it! They want to shut me up
Wrap, shackle, and collar me
I try to dumb it down but
They won’t even follow me
That Scientology, them embrace other mythologies
Like Joseph Smith, Zeus, the tooth fairy and Bartleby
They try to threaten me
Say I would get it the worse
Even be cursed by characters
From View Askewniverse
Fuck you complaining for?
You think you living in hell?
When Muslim chicks can’t ever wear pants
Without going to jail?
Hell yeah, religions the problem
That’s why I stay on the topic
That’s why they wanna stop me
Like I’m assaulting their prophet
Hate mail used to read
They were gonna kill me and such
Now they read
I don’t talk about other religions enough

[Verse 2: Noob]
God damn that I am
Religion’s a corporate scam
No voting for Uncle Sam
Enslaved with praying hands
The birth of the straw man
Whose part of his proclam
Fight tribal with family clans
Use rifles to conquer lands
Ourself is bought amassed in
Mass graves and abort disaster
Kill gays in courtless pastures
Enraging self-conscious rappers
Engage in Helter Skelter
The rays from the sun will meld them
Past days I was feeling helpless
I prayed for the god to selfish
To escape from my mental prison
Make days for cataclysm
Instating the global system
Embracing the earth collision
Extinction level event
From comets that’s heaven sent
Atomic malevolence
Trick knowledge from presidents
Instead of studying evidence
Pursuing benevolence
Galactic alliances
With secular scientists
Wonder astronomies
Exploring the bottomless
Ignored by the populace
Off course with the apocalypse

[Verse 3: Greydon]
Another form of population control
The very idea and nature
Of somebody needing to save us is old
Religiosity is taking its toll
You don’t even challenge the old
World views they placed in your skull?
That’s why I got you beat
With a whole array of common functions
You’re weak. You think you need
A god to accomplish something
Another classic case of codependence
If he’s all that you say that he is
He probably negates his own existence
They exterminated him
He’s in a form of Raids
Former slaves still serving the gods
Of former slaves
I fight for the freedom of strangers
When I blurt lines
I’m chill on the mic?
Like power of sixes first prime?
I’ve been constantly evolving
Since the first line
You can do one thing
I can invert mine
I dare your god to show up
To damn my blasphemy
I bet I have more questions for his ass
Then he’ll have for me
