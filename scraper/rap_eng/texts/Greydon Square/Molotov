[Intro]
Yeah, Grand Unified theory
Yeah, my name is Greydon Square
I just wanna share with you a little somethin'
You ready? check it

[Verse 1]
The product of God & Allah is Osama Bin Laden
George Bush, Saddam Hussein just bottling problems
Stickin' dirty rags in the top and lightin' the bottoms
Holdin' it with a smile to throw it into the crowd, kaplow

It's bigger than George Bush and Osama
Or if we ready for a black president named Obama
I'm tryin' to fight my own indoctrination
They think they can stop an Atheist by sayin' he's prayin' to Satan

Oh yeah? I fought the holy war in Iraq
So get ya facts straight before you stick your sword in my back
God Bless the troops, that's kinda odd
America only blesses you as a troop if you believe in their Gods

So where does that leave me?
They tell me to leave G
But at the same time tell me America needs me
See I can deal with people pointing fingers laughin' at me
But if it's one nation under God then I'll happily leave

Try to draft me then, call me a draft dodger
And try to catch me I'll be the one laughin' then
Why would I accept a religion that my slave owners practiced?
At the same time keeping the gauge under the mattress

People comin' in masses
Reverends & chaplains
Buddhists, Hindus, & Catholics
Even heaven's assassins
Secret organizations that convene at the Vatican
To discuss how to either convert or beat up the pacifists

I'm the Malcolm X of Atheism
By any means necessary take it to em'
This how I'll break it to em'

Your God is logically impossible
And can't even survive the most basic logical obstacles
God of the impossible huh

It'd be impossible for him to be the God of impossible stupid
You really need to look at the facts
Look at the holes in your religion, look at the cracks
Infinite Regression prevents a God from even existing

Let alone an intelligent one this is just the beginning
I'm Greydon Square and no longer am playin fair
I'm Kirk Cameron's worst nightmare, Cheers

[Outro]
Yeah Grand Unified theory
Just how I'm feelin' ya know
I just wanted to share that with y'all
I know i'll catch some heat
But you know what?
It don't even matter
We won't be bullied no more, no
Yeah
Grand Unified
