[Verse 1]
...me, I get lost in the music
Apart from the foolishness I dodge as youth in
A locked institution
An animal, far from the humans
80’s garbage tossed in a huge bin
... the universe was art for the viewing
We are one now but I was scarred in the union->
Every runner up has a Starks and a Ewing
You just play the part of the chewing...
...It’s like, i’m living a part in a movie
This is the scene where I’m sparking the doobie
With the audience arguing and booing
Partying and mooning
Grabbing sexual partners of their choosing
Why so serious? you won’t be here that long
And since I’m not I choose to spend my time makin' rap songs
...maybe hit the glass bong
Try to enlighten with music while hoping that people latch on

[Hook]
The bottom looks even worse when you've seen the top
...what we blazing here is nothing, you should see the crop
Watch another take his place when the leader drops
It’s only what you read about, peace us when see us out
Peace peace
Try to remain in control when you weave the route
I don’t care if she think that I’m ugly, music thinks i’m hot
I don't need to be a star I just need a spot
That's why whenever happen you upon me man i’m peace’n out
Peace

[Verse 2]
Ask people, I’m an asshole when it comes to music
And i’ll remind it comes before you like there’s nothing to it
...not doing what you love is foolish
On the cusp of stupid
Why would you not, when you love to do this?
...my dedication you could never doubt
...Can’t keep a girlfriend, but I can keep putting records out
These days, i’m only focused where my flow goes
That’s why i’m no longer nice to women that I don’t know
On the road so, much things tend to move in slow mo
But so quick you couldn't take a photo
Just hit em with the pound gee yoo logo
How far out you want to go though?
Load the ship we now leave for Qo’nos
That’s why our final gig was a no show
We were doing warp in the promo
Trying to get as far from the ozone
As you and your crew are from a dope flow
After leaving our mark on the whole globe

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This ain't no career it’s a way of life
Til you say goodnight
You understand when you pay the price
Late at night I stay awake and write
Instead of rage and fight
In the cage of the stage and lights
I can take a hint, you don’t want me repping ya
...you don’t want hip hop to do with nothing secular
...you just want the regular, coke and a 7-up
More boring flows from another clone that’s stepping up
...that’s what I try to explain to these hecklers
That where I’m from you either prey or predator
Where ignorance is your main competitor
Expressed in all shapes, races, types, and characters
Prepared to bust
...most of my fans don’t even like rap
...hopefully after me, they’ll know some nice tracks
Blow the crowd away throw the mic back
Then throw some light facts in the verse to excite cats, despite that...

[Hook]
