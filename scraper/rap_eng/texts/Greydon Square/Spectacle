[Verse 1]
Uncertain as anyone up in here but prepared
The faster you know I’m going, the less you know of where
This advanced rhymin’
Being kicked by a trans-intellectual flipped into quantum physics and nanoscience
Pick a subject, I’ll erupt quick
You? Unreliable like the firing pin of a musket
Falsify it all, save it if it’s truth
Then blaze it with the crew at the Daystrom Institute
...you can fall from grace
Just by thinking that all of the human gods are fake
You have now entered sovereign space
Resolved is the faction
Reverse course or be subjected to defensive action
This is the Captain
Aimin’ missiles at your cabin
Issuing the fire orders to send you into panic
...I predator eagle you feeble rabbits
....I can set your holiest book on fire just by speaking at it

[Chorus]
...it’s all just a spectacle
A stage of actors all competing for the best in show
...some play the victim of the deadly blow
...while others take the role of “I’m in control”
...faking wise, made to improvise
Dress the part, vacant lives, staying in disguise
Justify ignorance of where the center lies
The loser celebrates, the winner cries

[Verse 2]
...Tetrahydrocannabinol
Extra high off the wall trying to stand in the mall
Infinitesimally small are your chances
We make our own money, you suck balls for advances
...big words? Yea I use 'em
You looking at me like I’m an alien, yea I’m human
But like one I take vacations to type 1
Often the only one here armed with a light gun
Stalk it, bring it back to your laboratory
And dissect it gory with glory of a horror story
DOOMish, everyone else is a nuisance
Interrupting the cypher just tryin' to kick their two cents
Move it, there’s nothing to see here
Just to be clear we level up each year
High mileage, power level over nine thousand
The price you pay for success is borderline gouging

[Chorus]
...it’s all just a spectacle
A stage of actors all competing for the best in show
...some play the victim of the deadly blow
...while others take the role of “I’m in control”
...faking wise, made to improvise
Dress the part, vacant lives, staying in disguise
Justify ignorance of where the center lies
The loser celebrates, the winner cries

[Verse 3]
...You’d already be leaking if I planned to shoot ya
If it was about money I’d have more than Mansa Musa
Sands of future litter the cosmic shoreline
I am the reflection of your potential and you’re mine
....War time, want to go to trial?
We can see what the court finds
For a dime, lose the bluster
I’ve been all over the Laniakean Supercluster nukin’ busters
Rare quotes
As other quantum versions me compare notes
I just want to see how far up the stairs go
We are stardust adjusting for air flow
...Tear slow, or risk damaging content
Of the trans-intellectual’s family convent
When I try to speak these people don't listen
So I tried a new vehicle and repoed religion's

[Chorus](x2)
...it’s all just a spectacle
A stage of actors all competing for the best in show
...some play the victim of the deadly blow
...while others take the role of “I’m in control”
...faking wise, made to improvise
Dress the part, vacant lives, staying in disguise
Justify ignorance of where the center lies
The loser celebrates, the winner cries
