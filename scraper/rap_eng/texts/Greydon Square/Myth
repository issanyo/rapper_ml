[Verse 1]
This is costless rap
Jews hear my music and run out like holocaust is back
Europeans say this bloke can rap
Canadians say he off the map, how can you argue with that
Well you can if you have your own agenda
And been spoon fed religion from the placenta
Call yourself a christian muslim I know you do
Any religion bet it's the one your parents chose for you
And any admission of your doubts to someone close to you would not be accepted
Because forgiveness goes out the window when its someone different
And I dont know whats worse, that fact that I never believed
Or that I miss that community of church
There's two ways to control a population; hope and fear
Prove the existence of a soul and we'll go from there
Otherwise shut your mouth when you open it up to mention me Greydon Square
Yeah

[Hook]

Every human culture, has a set of creation myths
Buddhist muslim hindu xtian
Every human culture, has a set of creation myths
Jewish shinto pagan wiccan

Every human culture, has a set of creation myths
Voodoo deist Confucian Amish
Scientologist Zoroastrianist astrologist

Verse 2
Spoon fed this religion from the slave ship
They used faith to justify bringing slaves here
All the conducts and the rules in the good book
You swear by it, but failed to take a good look
Your completely sold
Just two centuries ago slave owners swore you didn't even have a soul
Now you blindly defend a faith
That was used plunder pillage and rape a whole entire race
DL Hugely's never met a black atheist
I'll never know a faith based on a factual basis
So we're even, from christian to islamic law
And now they speakin' up from Compton to Islamabad
They dont directly respond, they put it on their blog
Straw man attacks against me like I'm some kind of star
Huh, you pokin' at the hornets nest
I'll lyrically destroy your faith just to warn the rest

Chorus

Verse 3
All this over poor explanations of nature
I'm Denzel in Glory, for shoes i'll make it a caper
I have the scars of a slave in my DNA
So forgive me if I dont preach the faith like TD Jakes
See, I could never go to bed with said fiction
Because genetic memory stores the trama of shed whippin's
Next victim, any faith thats ever suppress women
And skewed science and education for its best interests

...for those who died for daring to question the system

And all lives and power that they've abused since then

The stories were myth from the instant of its invention

That's where their power comes from, your belief in their fiction

From native american to native african
...from the evangelicals to the pacifist
