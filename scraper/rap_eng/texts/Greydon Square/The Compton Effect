(Intro):
Hey, I need you to proofread this for me
Tell me if it's alright

My life is like my music, it hits you where it hurts
For what it's worth, this is more than just flippin' a verse
This me lifting' the curse from my knees, where it hurts
Like a squat during the last set when the muscles all burn

Nothing concerns me more
Than selling myself out just to earn me more
And there ain't no tellin' what that money would burn me for
Tryin' to convince me independence would turn me poor
Tryin' to turn me core

I'm turnin' down record deals, a deal wouldn't even help
Anything a label can do I can do for myself
People say: "Greydon, can't you talk about something else?"
But when I did songs about other things, it didn't help

You never heard of Greydon Square before I came out with Extian
Or educated you on Molotov with a lesson
Nobody cared before when I was talking in circles
You all wanted Rudy music, radio, and club songs

Selling drugs and love songs
How can I appreciate today's music? The love's gone
But this atheism caught on, didn't it?
All I did was put it in music, kicked the truth in my lyrics

And I never abused it
Cause I never was stupid enough to overdo it
'Til the message was useless
Setup the booth with delivery and some courage

Even if was nervous; I would go and spit with a purpose
I knew the stakes were high
That they would come with the king
I knew my ace was high
Higher than the queen or the jack to grace the sky
On third base I'm trying to take home if the outfielder takes the fly
I'm Greydon Square, I'm way ahead a' ya
These other rappers rhyme repetitive
I'm Kirk Franklin's quantum negative
I don't believe in your god because there's no evidence
But these theists actually believe their own rhetoric
Making songs, there's like six rappers that I'm taking on

The new fad: attack the atheist rappers the break is on
They knew we gonna keep rapping 'til the break of dawn
Me, Proclaim, Syqnys, Jayez Dallas and Mr. Gawn, P Funk and Reggie Von
And for the record; I'm still rational response
If you want to take it there we can take it there
I'm not hard to find you can Google Greydon Square
It is what it is, walking Stephen Hawking, black Carl Sagan
The logistical native host of atheist nation
Giving atheist the safest of havens
While at the same time
Fighting irrationality with Brian Sapient
Within my music, and I'm taping it
So who else can say their taking this fight where I'm taking it?
Unwelcome in the bible belt; they say they gon' kill me
I'm a threat, the new Hewie Newton, you feel me?
I give a damn about money, even less about fame
Ever since I became an atheist; everything changed
And that's real, while I'm tryna spread truth;
These other rappers are trying to catch females and stack bills
I'm a welcome change in the industry
But all the sacrilegious rabble-rousing
Has made me a few enemies
If hell existed, I'd probably be going
But since it doesn't I'ma keep on rolling like neighborhood nineties
These rappers spit for the club to get a quicker buck
Praying to the same Jesus Christ Adolf Hitler was
Christianity was a great idea
But it was poorly executed if neo-nazis can use it
Lets call it what it was; attempted genocide
Seeing your enemies faces, but through religious eyes
Now my own people starting to hate me
Because I showed how they wouldn't believe in this god if it wasn't for slavery
It would probably be Colombo or ra, [?] or niamie a ma
It's Greydon
Your friendly neighborhood heathen
Serving these theists rationality and reason
This is the Compton effect

[Outro] X 2
He doesn't believe in what we believe in we can make him
And we gonna do whatever it takes to break him
And if he doesn't break then we have to slay him
While asking our invisible friend: please save him

(Greydon)
A, is it straight?
Aight run it back
