[Verse 1: Gripp]
(We should be so lucky)
To elevate more
Move past the dark age lore and find a way
To carve a place for some rationality. Wait
Look what we've already done to the mortality rate
And we've barely begun. It's really baffling
How many pathogens are left to attack, the next task that we're grappling
Or maybe traveling? Extra-solar manned mission
Superluminal ansible signal transmission
(We should be so lucky)
To see a quantum machine
When we've barely conquered the steam engine, but it's not an impossible dream
Things currently known to no human
Control the explosion, expose the cold fusion
And with those two in concert, think of the problems we'd fix
Amazing knowledge that'll probably exist
Well, I've say we've got to try to drop the guise
For a shot to interlock our minds or AI that's pocket-sized

[Hook 1: Gripp]
(We should be so lucky)
To extend our lifespans
Or get cybernetic organs implanted
(We should be so lucky)
To ascend to a higher plane
Or even just to orbit the planet
(We should be so lucky)
To find other dimensions
And figure out what their relevance is
(We should be so lucky)
To die and wake up
To find another world that's even better than this
Grey!

[Verse 2: Greydon Square]
(We should be so lucky)
I find the cosmos insanely lovely
You know what bugs me, though? How all the times exist simultaneously
Absurd races tying knots with curved spaces
To slingshot into the future, to other places
Utter amazement, non-cluttered arrangements
This is post-singularity; some fools embrace it
While others use the tools just to construct a spaceship
They love homosapiens, they just want to stay it
(We should be so lucky)
Face it, we had a tough situation
Your Jesus never showed up; we got tired of waiting
Debating anhiliation with everybody's child
Patiently waiting for us to get the hell up out the way
Our best science is child's play compared to where we'd be
If we got out the child's way. We're well behind it
The 8-ball. I see the stars in great awe
While particles zip around me like a race car

[Hook 2: Greydon Square]
(We should be so lucky)
To live love or hurt
Or be able to contemplate our own worth
(We should be so lucky)
To share knowledge in peace
Build cities all over the world
(We should be so lucky)
To see every man your brother
Every girl forever your sis
(We should be so lucky)
To die and wake up
And find another world that's even better than this

[Verse 3: Gripp]
(We should be so lucky)
To arise to an afterlife
There's not a shred of evidence, but I get it: that'd be nice
But instead of stressing on ghosts or pressing reset
Let's focus on making the most of every second we get
Lest we forget, the world's messy, eventually death
Is coming to take us all into the entropy, yes
But instead of concentrating on the lies and the wrong
Let's put a thumbprint in the soil left behind when we're gone
(We should be so lucky)
To get a second chance, we got a first
Not promised a lot at birth. No pot of gold, just gotta work
And in those grim circumstances, we see the perfect chance
To reverse all the worst advancements that hurt the Earth, the cancers
Undermine the closed-mindedness and the blindness
That we find that they're defining us with, try to unwind it and get
Back to the triumph that we're capable of
Let go of the hate for the love. Take it from us

[Hook 3: Gripp]
(We should be so lucky)
To see Venus or Mars
Or more to see a trip between the stars
(We should be so lucky)
To have fans that need the art
Or carry on whatever plans that we could start
(We should be so lucky)
To find out whether
Other intelligent life could ever exist
(We should be so lucky)
To die and wake up
To find another world that's even better than this
