[Intro]
Yea, Greydon Square
Yo, Grand Unified Theory forever
Yea, listen

[Verse 1]
Don't hate me cause I'm atheist
Hate me cause I tell the truth which by default makes me atheist
You've been spoon fed and you don't even see it
You just absorbed the religion that's native to your region
You can't believe it so you won't believe it
Because the church has taught you that faith belongs in the place of reason
You have two sects spawned from Judaism
A regime that might as well have Uday and Kusay in 'em
With Saddam in the middle clutchin' a bomb
Telling you he's gonna use it if you don't touch the Qur'an
With a sister regime to me that's equally obscene
That threatens you with hell if you don't feed the machine
Cause if the Bible was written by man and man is flawed
Then what does that say about the Bible and God?
And if that same book was written by a man who wasn't trustworthy
What does that say about that book? Ya heard me?

[Chorus]
They say I'm in so far over my head
That I'm supposed to be dead
Pandora's Box but I ain't opened it yet
They just mad cause I'm telling the truth
And what worries 'em most
Is that you'll listen when I tell it to you
Question it all
Ask why god said let there be light
Before he created any light producing objects?
Question it all
Why is the poor forced to live in projects
While the rich are given a hill to live atop it?

[Verse 2]
What makes Republicans and Democrats any different than Bloods and Crips?
Absolutely positively nothin
Bloods wear red, Republicans have red states
Crips wear blue, while Democrats have blue states
Bloods are right side, Repubs are right wing
Crips bang left side, Democrats are left wing
Bloods and crips fight for territory on the streets
Republicans and Democrats fight for territorial seats
It's goin' down if you catch Mr. Clinton in a Texas town
With nothin' but Republicans around
He'll go the way of them people George executed
He should've known he was outta bounds
And Snoop ain't no safer on 108th and Crenshaw
And they don't care who invents law
He'll see them red flags hangin' and them black chucks flamin'
There ain't no difference between these people its all gang bangin'

[Chorus]
They say I'm in so far over my head
That I'm supposed to be dead
Pandora's Box but I ain't opened it yet
They just mad because I'm telling the truth
And what worries 'em most
Is that you'll listen when I tell it to you
Question it all
How can Democrats and Republicans have colors
But they hit us wit a gang injunction?
Question it all
How they can have rallies mass members in bunches
But then try to shut down our every function?

[Verse 3]
This thing is stronger than Blood, deeper than Crip
More vicious than a Republican's slandering lips
More suspicious than a Democratic party of six
Being sat next to a pope without religious intent
With the FBI watchin'
The CIA watchin', the FBI jottin'
A group of Muslims with bombs strapped to their chest plottin'
A bunch of Christians prayin' for hellfire to stop 'em
But not because they're planning to take life
But because they're not prayin' to the same damn god
That they are and it ain't right
They all just need to sit down and pop some pills
Before they get us all killed with their religious ideals
And that's real

[Chorus]
They say I'm in so far over my head
That I'm supposed to be dead
Pandora's Box but I ain't opened it yet
They just mad because I'm telling the truth
And what worries 'em most
Is that you'll listen when I tell it to you
Question it all
Why these rappers talk about sellin' drugs
But these labels try to tell me to change my content
Question it all
Why I need a club hit to make it
But I seen other people do it like Kanye and Common
Question it all
