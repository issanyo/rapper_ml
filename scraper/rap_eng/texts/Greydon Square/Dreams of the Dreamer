[Verse 1]
Blue dream, reveals me as a groove fiend
While our progress, is tied up like a shoestring
He’s too mean when describing the system’s flaws
Dismiss it all as the inside of the prison walls
Rip the guards, as fat cats and pistol hogs
While we have the strength to lift a star
Vision jarred, similar to battle haze
Trying to run, either this a away or that away
Runnin rings in my Saturn maze
It’s akin to the weather of Seattle on a Saturday
How can I take a stand living in the United States of imaginationland
Trying to make the band
Making statements that you hate and that you can’t defend
An innocent gaze through the mind of an ancient man
So what
They told me I was right the whole time but then I woke up
Damn...

[Chorus]
What I see cannot be, it flees sanity
Is it me having the dream or the dream having me?
As curious of being as me I had to see
Is it me having the dream or the dream having me?
Please answer me, emcees fans or beat
Is it me having the dream or the dream having me?
The culprit is growth ego causality
But is it me having the dream or the dream having me

[Verse 2]
Hereditary light child
Ever pursued by this sedentary lifestyle
Right now it feels like i’ve been asleep forever
It even felt like I was sleepwalking through each endeavor
Bite down, this’ll only hurt a second
Kind of like the first time when you heard the record
A double edged sword strike when you least expected
...to protect everything just to be infected
Like how? Asleep late trying to escape the dreamscape
Appease fate as a pebble in a deep lake
...two ski’s through a weak wake
Quantum leap great, ancient steps trying to retrace
A street race at type 3 only halfway
As a rhyme lord that’s walking a lonely pathway
Type 4 world portal in the cache
I'd packed to stay but then I woke up

[Chorus]
What I see cannot be, it flees sanity
Is it me having the dream or the dream having me?
As curious of being as me I had to see
Is it me having the dream or the dream having me?
Please answer me, emcees fans or beat
Is it me having the dream or the dream having me?
The culprit is growth ego causality
But is it me having the dream or the dream having me

[Verse 3]
A soldier with a rifle cocked
Back at home known to soar like a psychonaut
I forgot he’s alone in a familiar place
The homegrown battlezone that he will escape
Sniper shot, wake up late show up naked to fist fight
It’s all fun and games till you wake up in this life
Slack and skate then he’ll rush to try to graduate
Mad at fate, in a hurry to procrastinate
He’s got the courage to elaborate
It’s kind of blurry, i almost got to meet him, but I had to wait
Impassioned Grey cast away on the astral plane
Stashed away experience to be ascertained
The past remains as lessons of another
Now peering through the looking glass
We could have been as brothers
A massive chain of two lives broken
He asked to trade then I was woken

[Chorus](x2)
What I see cannot be, it flees sanity
Is it me having the dream or the dream having me?
As curious of being as me I had to see
Is it me having the dream or the dream having me?
Please answer me, emcees fans or beat
Is it me having the dream or the dream having me?
The culprit is growth ego causality
But is it me having the dream or the dream having me
