[Intro]
Yeah
Yo, for all the stars out there, ha

[Verse 1]
Radio flows from the paleo age
I’ll take slaves of the radio and cave in their cranial cage
Bars only spit harmonious as far as loneliness
Rather be that than the phoniness
Dazed and confused my physics lessons take em to school
You only fail me if you breaking the rules
Rich harmonics if you hit our chronic
We might actually be able to get somewhere if we just are honest
Divergent rhyme surgeon who’s quite certain
That teaching through music was his life’s purpose
He’s hopeless without, only uses his craft on people who open their mouth
Here's hopin' they doubt
Anticipation like a chess move
Only with the paper and pages will they respect you
You better not be special I’m going through your death throes
Cause they won’t heal anything on you save for a flesh wound so press through

[Chorus]
Star breaker trying to craft the pages to see where the art takes us
Logically get music infused with the raw flavor
Knowledge from the deviant pupil of Carl Sagan
Operating under the title of star breaker
Pull the curtains back to reveal that it’s all made up
Making shorter work of the zealots and false saviours
Always in the lab and I’m looking at hard data
I discovered

[Verse 2]
Layered textures hidden within rare lectures
Stay inspector I think it’s a fair gesture
You crater to pressure while the knowledge that I spit is free the flavor is extra
When you mention me make sure you bring up I was all in
Death through melody and brewed lyric I found my calling
There’s still Eddie Collins he’s just barely conscious
If he was awake he’d look at all that he accomplished
A twist of fates fiction isn’t in vase
The supplies that you brought are not in conditional taste
I’m just being honest grieve your wallet
Leave your future unborn
I was producing these kinda songs before your Sun formed
None gone everybody caught off guard
As their world eater eats their planet a la carte
And you ask me what ma problems are
I’m tryna leave in the space you just happy that you got a job

[Chorus]
Star breaker trying to craft the pages to see where the art takes us
Logically get music infused with the raw flavor
Knowledge from the deviant pupil of Carl Sagan
Operating under the title of star breaker
Pull the curtains back to reveal that it’s all made up
Makin' shorter work of the zealots and false saviours
Always in the lab and I’m looking at hard data
I discovered

[Verse 3]
Grimy dirty shtick
But I still defeat in ten to the minus thirty-six
While the night is earliest
Tie the tourniquet and seal his field wound
Fly the burly ship and drop him off at the nearest moon
Hear them goon from the doors as we fill the tomb
Nothing but hip hop noises it fills the room
They been ashed in the face as we permeate throughout the cosmos like gravitational waves
Heat in store for anyone keeping score
Precisely what you get for thinking it’s either or
Beats galore, eating like a feeding frenzy, peace is within me what you looking to the preacher for?
Too many infinities to count
I spit every out and watch my enemies recount
Nice board I think I’ll explore it on the night’s tour with a light sword on my way to type-4

[Chorus] X 4
Star breaker trying to craft the pages to see where the art takes us
Logically get music infused with the raw flavor
Knowledge from the deviant pupil of Carl Sagan
Operating under the title of star breaker
Pull the curtains back to reveal that it’s all made up
Makin' shorter work of the zealots and false saviours
Always in the lab and I’m looking at hard data
I discovered
The form of (star breaker)
