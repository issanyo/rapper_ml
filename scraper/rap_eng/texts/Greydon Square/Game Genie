[Intro]
Yea, this feels good
That's what music is about, right?
It's supposed to make you feel good, no more no less
Well, I take that back
It's supposed to make you feel, but, you know?
Yo, check it, look

[Verse 1]
You wanna battle, you stupid
Trust me (dummy), it's a bigger fantasy than John Williams and George Lucas
Liar liar, so let's just set your pants on fire
I go to war with stars like X-Wings and Tie Fighters
And if you nervous it's curtains without the curtains
Steal the Delorean, create a paradox on purpose
My flow is the Wicked Witch of the West
With the Wicked Witch of the East, sweet, kissing her neck
I don't care who it is (uh-uh), everybody is next
I'll rip my arms off and tell them to battle my leg
And you just so stupid that probably went over your head
I'm that grenade without the pin and you holding it in
Like a fart in an elevator with a nine and a ten
Looking at you clench your booty cheeks nodding they head
Like yeah, we know what the hell, why don't you let it out and poop
So you drop a silent but deadly one and scoot
You'll come home to me with your wife after a hard day
You'll have to believe that it's not butter, it's Parkay
A SciFi nerd, I watch it all day
Too much Trek, BattleStar, Farscape, and Stargate
I'm in Las Vegas rolling a hard eight
Freddie vs Jason, part eight
I should charge you a fee and we should use PayPal
Because my rhymes are super like Big Gay Al (super)
Lyrically I'm off the charts
Like an imaginary red line spiking through the cardboard part
The wackiest craziest stuff ever
I'm out in a thong in the snowiest rough weather
Keep your teflon, I'll just stick with the tough leather
You should try rapping sometime, really it's much better
I'll flip it backwards like a gymnast master
Penis my suck, just can you bastard
Right off and laughter

[Chorus](x2)
You couldn't beat me with a Game Genie
And you getting penetrated with the same weenie
Sitting there riding wishes with the same Genie
I'm at the sex olympics, I've got the game weenie

[Verse 2]
And you should read my lyrics after those four
They're colder than the other side of a door in a snowstorm
(What's my name?) The super-gross Greydon Square
I'll have to shut down my right hemisphere to make it fair
My similes and metaphors come out of my mouth
With so much force they dent metal doors
Swinging excalibrinian swords (yea)
I'm stealing everything in the store, even yours
I'm stealing from the rich and the poor, I'll leave them poorer
Cause they should've been with me when I was busting through the door
My body's actually stuck in the morgue (oh)
What you see before you is just a digital projection from the borg
And I'm coming for war
So lock the two top locks with a two-by-four and look under your door
I'm a thundering storm who's born of a [?]
A fat kid eating the cake and wanting some more
A greater wizard than Gandalf or Dumbledore
I have six shots and I've sunken four
I'll jump aboard the Titanic as it plunges inside the Atlantic
Get to the ocean's floor just to try salmon
My lifespan is longer than the Cambrian expansion
With more equations than Albert Einstein had his hands in
What are the chances of you defeating me?
You ain't even in the same sport, let alone league as me
Lyrically gifted, leave you dripping like Syphilis
With more bruises than a child abuse victim
Wow

[Chorus](x4)
You couldn't beat me with a Game Genie
And you getting penetrated with the same weenie
Sitting there riding wishes with the same Genie
I'm at the sex olympics, I've got the game weenie

[Outro]
That's what it's about
Feels good, don't it?
That's what I'm talking about
We're going to ride this one out
Thank you for listening
I'm Greydon Square
Enjoy the night
