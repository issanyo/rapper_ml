[Intro]
Music is, is stirring you need it, it’s soulful
I have weird stories to tell you
This is what my son said to me, he goes
You write good you sing good, how come you're not a rock star
I said son, for every rock star there’s 20 million that aren’t
I’m one of the 20 million that aren’t

[Chorus]
No rest till I can wake up on the beach front
We’ll dream while we’re awake
Peace beside the streaming waves
With lots of green to blaze
No rest till I can wake up on the beach front
These dreams won’t chase themselves
This is more than seizing wealth
It’s worth that seeding smell

[Verse 1]
This is more about the long success
Securing the financial freedom to never give the songs a rest
Bong for stress everything else amounts to hustle
My motivation stems from the days I recount the struggle
I know rappers half as skilled making triple
While they expect masters to work for nickels
It's pass the riddle
I know my flow is great
I done changed lives with it
Now it’s time to wake up by the oceanscape
A billion for my signature they ever doubt
It's a fine line between making off and selling out
Whatever route we always seek to build
Automated income all so we can chill (chill)
We done with all the ripped and the running
Now we're splitting bluntage where the sun is
Numbers that you see in your account
That when you see 'em have you smile
Cause you got it making music that you wanted, wow

[Chorus]
No rest till I can wake up on the beach front
We’ll dream while we’re awake
Peace beside the streaming waves
With lots of green to blaze
No rest till I can wake up on the beach front
These dreams won’t chase themselves
This is more than seizing wealth
It’s worth that seeding smell

[Verse 2]
With dreams you have to be a little selfish
You can chase your own or help to build somebody else’s
I’d rather choose the former
And seek to live out my inner peace where it’s warmer
Aura a little oranger with the satisfaction that I did it right
Ensuring nothing but mellow days and lifted nights
With the right decisions life is different
You can go from the lowest form of blind to a sight exquisite
I want my place by the sea breeze
And have the most gorgeous
Roll my weed and brew my tea leaves
Who would’ve thought this could be achieved through sentences
Carried to the water by all the people interested
That listened in
Motivated wish them wins
That have them shining like the ocean waves glistening
They all visit him and all reminisce
No more envisioning this until I get it, it’s

[Chorus]
No rest till I can wake up on the beach front
We’ll dream while we’re awake
Peace beside the streaming waves
With lots of green to blaze
No rest till I can wake up on the beach front
These dreams won’t chase themselves
This is more than seizing wealth
It’s worth that seeding smell

[Verse 3]
Nothing but work on schemes and stanzas until I see the sea from the verandah
Sol the only dancer Luna makes her rounds as we romance her
On ocean sands expounding on the answers, it’s more than money
Fortune is funny I just don’t get the joke yet
Tryna make it to the tier of success from a broke vet
So I stay lonely on the dough track
If for nothing else than writing songs on my boat deck
I’d still be me if I was just as paid, my library would be bigger than my living space
The very nature's contradicting like a vivid daze
I miss the days of wondering if vision pays
And if it doesn’t, it was worth the gamble
The dry spy burns within me like the perfect candle
Rejection's something I keep
Till every morning sand is under my feet
No wonder it seems, it's...

[Chorus]
No rest till I can wake up on the beach front
We’ll dream while we’re awake peace beside the streaming ways
With lots of green to play
No rest till I can wake up on the beach front
These dreams won’t chase themselves
This is more how seizing oil, It’s worth that seeding smell
No rest till I can wake up on the beach front
No rest till I can wake up on the beach front
