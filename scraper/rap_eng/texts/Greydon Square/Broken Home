[Hook]
This is my life in a broken home, broken home
My life in a broken home. Cause I had no home at all

[Verse 1]
I remember when I lived with this chick
My foster mother used to punch my face, and I was only six
I remember getting beat with a brick
Cause I tried to steal some cereal for me and my sister cause we was hungry as shit
Going to the school with bloody noses
Hell, me and my sister used to share the same clothes with
My fucking foster mother was too stubborn and selfish to go buy some more
Can you imagine going to school in some holey shoes
Wearing your sisters pants, covering up your bruises
My cries for help were useless
My teacher just said it was all my fault, and I was really stupid
So when I used to show up with welts on my face
Cuts on my back, and burns on my waist
Everybody used to stare, and glare at the wounds
I didn't care, cause I was just scared after school
I would wait until dark, just stare at the moon
Walking slowly as hell home, prepared for my doom
Wishing to god, that I was given a break
But I'm six years old and I'm gonna die in this place

[Hook]
This is my life in a broken home, broken home
My life in a broken home. Cause I had no home at all

[Verse 2]
After my ninth birthday, my prayers were answered
But the hate had already spread through my body like cancer
I was moved to this place with over two hundred kids
Who had lived the same way I did
Now, tell me why they had hired this staff named Victor
I have seen some sick people in my life, but he was sicker
I remember going on an outing to the snow
Me, Howard, Cameron and Joe and Greg were supposed to go
But he only took me and Cameron
Left Greg, Joe, and Howard back on campus staring
Then we get to the snow, and I knew something was funny
Cause he said they were talking and told me to play in the snow
Alone, he didn't tell Cameron to go alone
What the hell was going on
So I dipped around the corner, acting like I was playing
They came back around the back of the van
I seen his hands down in Cameron's pants
Nothing would've prepared me for that, even if I knew in advance
Then he spots me staring, threw Cameron out the way
Then he jumped out the van, then he grabbed me by my face
Proceeded to drag my ass to the edge of the cliff
Then he said "listen here you little son of a bitch
You didn't see shit, you never saw shit
So if you don't want to end up dead you're never gonna say shit"
And I never did
But I'm praying to God that I see Victor again
So I can remember what he did and put two in his chin
I'mma make sure that he'll never do it again

[Hook]
This is my life in a broken home, broken home
My life in a broken home. Cause I had no home at all

[Outro]
Yea, this song is dedicated to all the kids who grew up in the system
With nobody - except each other. This for y'all
