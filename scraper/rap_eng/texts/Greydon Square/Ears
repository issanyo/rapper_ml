[Intro]
Yeah Grand Unified... Oh, you know that already... Okay
Rational Response... What? You know that too?
Alright fine what ever I'm just gonna say whatever the hell I wanna say

[Verse 1]
Look
Now when I spit just know that part of it's phlegm
For these rappers who are just mad because I'm smarter than them
And ego not withstanding you know what they gonna say
"I don't have book smarts I but I got street smarts"
Yeah okay
That's just a way to justify that you dumber than hell
You got the IQ of a rock
That you smart as a box of nails
I guess you hood if you can read at a 4th grade level
And that you honestly think that a spoon is a small shovel
That's why these rappers think that Cannabis is wack
Because he makes 'em feel stupid and they can't have that
I guess with money you don't have to be smart huh?
You could be a Lloyd from Dumb and Dumber part one
Talking about cars when you got hit by a parked one
Claimin' that you're fire but don't know how to start one
What?

So let 'em talk
Let 'em call me a Square
'Cause they just mad
Because my ears are bigger than theirs
Its West game

[Hook]
No
Don't stop the show

Don't
Don't Stop the show

[Verse 2]
You should treat my metaphors like a slap in the face
You a wienie you should come in a package of 8
We can battle for a million dollars cash in the case
You spit a wack verse to me and I'm gon' laugh in your face
(HAHA that was wack)
You say I'm corny that ain't nothin' new
I've been told worse from people more important that you
They think I'm different now 'cause I don't cuss no more but trust
I fornicate under the consent of the king you up still
My music's jumpin' like a frog on a limb
This is real talk fool like dialogue on a film
I get juiced like Barry Bonds on a steroid binge
Spit balls and sick lines like your elbow bends
You ain't gonna beat me so you need to stay focused
That's harder than finding a single woman with no kids
(That's hard)
And if you tell your crew I dis you in pairs
'Cause they probably mad too my ears are bigger than theirs

It's west game

[Hook]
No
Don't stop the show
(Compton's version of Will Smith

Don't
Don't Stop the show

[Verse 3]
My ears are so big I had to pierce with a Glock 40
That's why I didn't 'cause for me it rings a nice sporty
You won't catch me in 'em vagina-less cock orgies
My ears jump off my head and patrol my block for me
I use my ears as portable fox holes
Wrap 'em around my body so I know where the shots go
When enemy fire comes in from multiple spots yo
Whenever I'm out rover patrollin' the Congo
(where they at?)
Say what you want I know you can't stand it
My ears a damn planet
My ears are bigger than a fat Janet
(That's big)
That college you in is bigger than mad campus
And got more meat on it than a double Quizno ham sandwich
So you can't say nothing 'bout it I ain't already said
And if you bring it to battle then you already dead
There better things to talk about than what's on Eddie's head
So you better bring something else if you want Eddie's head

[Hook]
No
Don't stop the show
(Compton's version of Will Smith
Compton's version of Will Smith)
Don't
Don't Stop the show
(Compton's version of Will Smith
Compton's version of Will Smith)

[Outro]
There's no way I can put this on the album
This song is stupid as hell
Balls on your chin
