[Intro: Vulcan Master and Tuvok]
You were surprised to hear a master admit to having emotions?
Yes
Emotions can be a powerful tool, to deny their existence is illogical. But you must learn to control them
Why?
Do you wish to be taught?
I would question everything you say
You would not be a worthy pupil otherwise
Let us begin

[Verse 1]
The first question is it even logical
The mastery of craft if the achievement is possible
Logic or not people chase it
Following thoughts of breaking laws to teach the layman the secret language
Each is taken to the deepest location to observe the leader speaking to a nation, unified
Let me kick to them the curriculum the source we get the wisdom from
The center in our system of mentoring choices
Nature is our training space this is where we go for broke the dojo is a sacred place
So grab your gi prepare yourself to battle me
The goal is the sole prevention of becoming the casualty
You suffer less when you have to learn to do it well
But you can learn how not to if you find out what the truth entails
You will fail, many times over then come to learn from mistakes like any fine soldier
Only to emerge alone and superb
What turns most people off is going through the work
Rolling through the hurt, digging through the manuscripts and combing through the words
Putting older students first
He’s to make simple complex systems, admit faults scrutinise everything and project wisdom
They visit with him after the class as he ponders if he ever really mastered the craft
Passing the grass hoping he can tackle the task
Of suddenly teaching his pupils to last all the vast
The length of the trial is painstakingly lifelong
It might be the ultimate asymptote to set your sights on
The illusion will be it’s close enough to seize
And one day you might buy the notion it’s something you’ve achieved but
I would argue you no closer than ever
The path cost life total mastery is extra
You understand that there is always someone that can teach you
Forever novice even though they call you sifu
The truth is being one and achieving is not mutually exclusive just the unity is illusive
There in all this nudeness, careless while he’s tearing off the errant floss protruding
There in awe, let us pause for the perilous cause
A former derelict who would become a master cause he cared to evolve
Beginners look at this as his life intermediates write
While the experts spoke to him for advice
He laid it for better he chases forever patient and clever
With the weaknesses he waited to sever
Obsequious without the preachiness
All the skill and wisdom means nothing without the leadership it’s still a struggle
Watch his effortless detail explanation of information
He’ll break it down to its foundation and clear the rubble
Beginning as a fan of it then he as an artist has a hand in it
As a legend he’s spread across the planet since
Case of what the standard is in between the honor and respect is where they sandwich him
I don’t know how he manages, he planned to dedicate his life to it
This ain’t a fight movement who amidst an example of life tuning
The only prize after so maybe one day he’ll stand among the grand masters

[Chorus]
For those who chose the brave, the endless journey
The lonely road paved by unsung heroes we’ve lost
We dedicated to those who should be elevated
You shouldn’t follow if you don’t plan to give it your all
For those who chose the brave, the endless journey
The lonely road paved by unsung heroes we’ve lost
We dedicated to those who should be elevated
You shouldn’t follow if you don’t plan to give it your all
