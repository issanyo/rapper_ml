[Verse 1]
They used to call me the super gross, but now its Duck Butter
We started off as strangers but now we blood brothers
The 5th horseman it’s none other
The catholic church could’ve prevented this with just one rubber
Silly abstinence challenged by active raptivists
These rappers actually fear these ideological savages
This is aimed at the sheeple, the pawns of the Vatican
Who fell for Pascal’s gambler’s fallacy law of averages
What you would see if you lost the baggage
Galactic structure so big, you don’t even know that you’re looking at it
Update your status to say dude is insane
...even on the tracks where he isn’t using his brain
I was writin lyrical songs before you cats discovered it
Back before bishop Eddie Long was having sex with kids
And out of court settlements, you can go and tell him that
We never needed his god, go somewhere else and peddle it
...I’ll quit rap once the world ends
Until then, you gon’ just get caught up in the whirlwind
Because I’ll show you real sin
You’ll witness horror first hand like Osama Bin Laden’s girlfriends

[Hook]
...they say we’re in a fallen state
Downplay accomplishments, only highlight mistakes that we often make
Then want to tell us to walk which way
How to talk and play
Even though most of them walk astray
Save your judgements we’re off today
You want to judge you can take a closer look into your author’s ways
Cause i’ll look into the darker shade
See you all afraid
Of the ghosts from your father’s age

We’re all murderers literal war criminals
I’m not cynical i’m just making it more visible
Mentally wounded vets seen between long intervals
Lost in the bitter cold ward of hospital rooms
...the operation is launched no more subliminals
Generational war we’re coming for your general
How the hell is the base of our mountain your pinnacle?
Information more valuable than gold or emeralds
Or your toted centerfold
Over we should have been done thrown
Any government every throne
...the old man said listen
“there’s people counting on our brothers to keep set tripping”
Prison industrial complex, a fresh sentence

[Hook x2]
...they say we’re in a fallen state
Downplay accomplishments, only highlight mistakes that we often make
Then want to tell us to walk which way
How to talk and play
Even though most of them walk astray
Save your judgements we’re off today
You want to judge you can take a closer look into your author’s ways
Cause i’ll look into the darker shade
See you all afraid
Of the ghosts from your father’s age
