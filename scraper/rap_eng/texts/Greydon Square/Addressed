[Intro]
Yeah
Yo, you
No no not you
YOU
You know who I'm talking to
Hey I want to address this little thing between us
It's funny I kinda feel like I'm telling like a
A stalking ex girlfriend to back off
Like you can't go somewhere
You know a restraining order
Yo

[Verse]
Ever since I said that I was creatin' an album
I been getting all sorts of hate mail by the thousands
People tell me I'm soaked in gasoline by the gallons
And that I will be thrown in hell by a god who is childish
It's kinda funny although most of it's stupid
'Cause your god's an atheist too and he loves my music
Had I not spoken the truth you wouldn't have even addressed me
And you would've found it pointless to even address me
I was on to bigger and better things 'til you wrote me
Like a little girl with her feelings hurt trying to provoke me
What a joke, just another Internet tough guy
Hiding behind a keyboard watchin' the dust fly
Off of a bible he hasn't read in ages
Taking shots at Muslims, Atheists, and pagans
You're a model Christians aren't you?
Paranoid delusional thinking
That everybody else it out to harm you
Atheist Idol, that was best you had?
You're an altar boy shouldn't you be in bed with your dad?
And you got the nerve to call somebody a house nigga?
When you believe in the bible just like a house nigga?
And here we go, I'm not from Compton
And you didn't like Pandora's Box send me your comments
I think this lil dude has a crush on me
And per the bible, rules it means you have to put him to sleep
Deuteronomy says so
You wanna talk? Hell no
'cause while you talkin I'm coming after your neck
Like strep throat
The bible you believe in is false
You know it and I know
That's the real reason I'm pissing you off
You're a liar no matter what you'll always be one
Like a bully who needs a victim you'll always need one
So go ahead homie and admit that you're jealous
Just like your god, you know I'm the feces and you smell it
Kind of like the hole in the stomach of my ex-girlfriend
I really got you kickin' and screamin' up a whirlwind
Don't I?
Why don't you call up yo god to strike me?
Oh I forgot it's because he's fake like Thor so bite me
The real good news is you wanna be just like me
Rap and think reasonably just like me
And since you know so much about me
Feel free anytime you like to open your mouth about me
Gimme the press, the light, an audience for the mic
And continue to reinforce them Christian stereotypes
Chump

[Outro]
Oh man
You know what
Wait wait wait wait wait
Stop it stop it stop the beat stop it
I love how me and Brian just inherit
Each other's enemies
