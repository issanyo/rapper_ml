[Intro]
Yea, what up? Ha

[Verse 1]
They be like, kick a flow, why you teasin'?
Tell us about religion, physics and why you heathen
Value seeking, waiting to plug the data in
Try to scale it downwards making sure the equation fits
Toy soldiers in a school taken hostage
That boils over into more fools making profit
Snakes in office - I mean in the pejorative sense
We only aim to influence to change
While you’re on the fence
Lines imported by the foreman like it’s morning
Lying dormant, while they got you thinking I’m important
Rhyming Norse hymns as a Ragnarok astronaut
With a massive axe that’s bigger than your pastor’s spot
...call me Astaroth, when I grab the mic and crash the block
Free obligatory passive shots, checking inventory after loss
So reimburse me or I’m taxing y'all
Your story doesn’t capture all, only a cross section
While you gave up on chess and constantly lost checkers
I was stuck in the barracks learning to chop records
Just barely beginning to explore the god specter
I’m often known to start lecture in the Hoth sector
Or in my lab chartin' star vectors
Charging ultra combo art specials
...free to exceed the large threshold inducing a far echo
Norchin' bowls with the gang telling stories of the slaves
Portal entry closed to the same
Orange tang tastes like quark gluons
On a deadlier ship than the one that Worf flew on
A poor child from the Oort cloud
Who spends his time pursuing mastery of sword style
Forget the minutia
We often take for granted that we live in the future
Where most of our lives are exquisite
A relic of the nineties, no it isn’t Captain Sisko
You can call me “Smiley”, the rogue edition
Holy wisdom exposed as a lonely prison
They told me “listen, you going on a solo mission
And your whole team is drafted
If your cover is blown - no strings attached”
Huh, so bear down or be just another painted faced clown
Running bare assed through the fair grounds
...it’s their sound
If this is Type 3 then I’m letting my hair down
Prepared to drown
If it’s cyclical time, let us begin again
The only Square globally recognized since Tienanmen

[Chorus]
Nevermind the repugnance
They hate that we exist and we love it
Unified, What Up?!
Every line heavy substance
Embedded in a style we’ve entrusted
TXi, What up?!
They won’t know how to make us fail
They’re simply lower rated on the scale
[?] What up?!
...the endeavor is where we find
Who of us will get better as we climb
So Authentic
What up!?

[Verse 2]
Hip-hop for days, while it’s whip-shots for slaves
Sick drops ablaze, tryin’ to get out the maze
Y’all can settle, I wanna boggle with this
The only person to come back up from a bottomless pit
Was me. Tug the trigger see how hollow it gets
The greatest penalty you pay is when you try to get this for free
It all costs, from soliloquy to small talk
Dumb World Star to Star Talk
Guard dog, try to enter, get your arm gnawed
Your mission resolved is yearn soft
Puff inhale, then contemplate on how to deal with being
When you’re coming down from an upper scale
Bring the fight, you wanna take his job
But beware it’s muay thai, and it’s feint and dodge
It’s all fiction, you just make them gods
If Jesus can come back to life then so can Jason Todd

[Chorus]
Nevermind the repugnance
They hate that we exist and we love it
Unified, What Up?!
Every line heavy substance
Embedded in a style we’ve entrusted
TXi, What up?!
They won’t know how to make us fail
They’re simply lower rated on the scale
Reaper Nation, what up?!
...the endeavor is where we find
Who of us will get better as we climb
So Authentic
What up!?

Nevermind the repugnance
They hate that we exist and we love it
Unified, What Up?!
Every line heavy substance
Embedded in a style we’ve entrusted
Reaper Nation, What up?!
They won’t know how to make us fail
They’re simply lower rated on the scale
Progeny, what up?!
...the endeavor is where we find
Who of us will get better as we climb
#GU
What up!?

[Outro]
Ha! For every house under the unified banner
Yea, #GU what up? Ha! Grand Unified Theory!
Yea! #GU what up?
