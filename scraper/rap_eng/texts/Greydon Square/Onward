Forward! they can not stop us now
Only hope to contain us, let em try and knock us down
Onward!
They'll never stop us now
So they hope to contain us, let em try and knock us down

[Verse 1]
This is hallway memory flashback
...we watched em sugar coat good times with a laugh track
While they force fed us Shadrack Meshack Abednego
...in the same meal as that Mercedes Benz and ho
I made music from a Greydon perspective
Ex gang-bangin' atheist veteran
Waiting til 2011, so i can hear all these 2012 freaks preach
About the end of the world is the end of the week
Grab the grinder and scrap the keef
...throw it in a bowl grab the lighter and blaze the heat
...while you all excited hold your breath and think of me, (Mr. X)
Peace to Carl Sagan
...let your mind be everywhere like tattoos on basketball players
Like the dark cape of Darth Vader
...I cloak it all and pack a large saber
Only the living have a problem with death
That seems to be the only saga that's left

Forward! they can not stop us now

[Verse 2]
Keep your slow raps and white tees
...the only thing you could bring to excite me is a ship capable of light speed
Otherwise don't invite me cause I might surprise ya
...with metaphors that'll send you beyond the light horizon
My fans are smarter than the average groupie
...they hear you and want their money back like a bad movie
That's why I seek a higher purpose
...to be free in all the ways you're not like Tyler Durden
You are not your job or your mother-fucking khakis
...there's a lot of people walking around here unhappy
...but that's life, that's why snap and attack the mic precise, emcee'n;
...if I ain't spitting then I'm leaving'
Cause i don't believe in spirits and demons I'm a heathen
...while the people who believe it the most have never seen it
This is the great age where every man has his price
...and for that wheel of fortune they will move that Vanna White

[Verse 3]
I'm on a collision course with several rappers
... Bent over backwards, over a few books of which I've dissed Several chapters
If I explode, you'll get hit by the metal fragments
... You fit in, I want to stand out like a yellow jacket
I'll use rebel tactics if the battle's ever drastic
... Which involves a shovel and a hatchet
The only universal language is mathematics
... Infinitely massive, self induced vacuum;
It's where you live stupid, your own corner of the galaxy
... So why in your hell, would you ever want to challenge me?
A simple shot across your bow
... Warning you to chill out and keep my name out your mouth
We'll never agree on religion or see eye to eye
... So you just preach yours and I'm a spit rhymes
... Let our paths go different ways not intertwine
... If you cool then I'm fine, otherwise
