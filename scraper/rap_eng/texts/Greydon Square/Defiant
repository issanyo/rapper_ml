[Verse 1]
It doesn’t matter what I don’t believe in
If I’m not after education as a rapper then it’s open season
From there it’s easy to fall
Often forgetting you’re fortunate, lucky to be breathing at all
This is our method to teach, it’s just a sound to them
You know me
My consciousness always stays on the outer rim
....Stop trying to make us threats and face your fears
...I train with peers
That often spit too complex for the layman's ear
I miss debate sorely
Dropping knowledge on the faithers from the eighth story
But it was fake glory
Hollow victories
Over those who couldn’t follow history
So I moved on to topple misery
Avoided flocks and swarms
You’ll often find your conscious torn
As you try to separate from the non-informed
...The industry couldn’t account for me
Where other rappers had limits I exceeded the boundaries

[Chorus]
Watch them knock our place
And say it’s not our space
But we ain't going away
My whole camp stands unified (GU)
We ain't gonna kneel, cave, surrender, bow or move aside
They want to break us up
And want us back at odds
'Cause, we ain’t going away
Never this
They want the ground we’ve taken back and then recompense
We’ll resist

[Verse 2]
Your purpose asunder
While like the King Lizard I emerge from my slumber
Purged, full of wonder
Come up with theories just to test 'em out
...See it for it is than be left to doubt
On the mic I go the extra mile
Match graffiti with the freshest style
Show these people how the west get down
Truce or die, you decide
Truthfully you wouldn’t survive any set of Grand Unified
Your foolish pride’ll leave you in a pool of rhymes
From people who enlighten, you still trying to fool the mind
Nice try, we’re not buyin'
You might be high, but you're not flyin'
Stay in your sight lines
Fight crime
Or become a part of the cycle at night time
With like minds
Quite blind, trying to lead us all to the promised
As we all fall to the comet

[Chorus]
Watch them knock our place
And say it’s not our space
But we ain't going away
My whole camp stands unified (G U)
We ain't gonna kneel, cave, surrender, bow or move aside
They want to break us up
And want us back at odds
'Cause, we ain’t going away
Never this
They want the ground we’ve taken back and then recompense
We’ll resist

[Verse 3]
Through space and time, the responsibility to blaze a rhyme
Always falls on me because I’m Greydon Prime
...My punchlines aren’t even fun to people
I start to spit and they look at me like I summoned evil
None are equal
So I run the track like a dean run a cathedral
Ton of weed though
Come and see yo
...The cosmic array has us locked in a daze
Chillin' with my people in oculus space
A negro
...Yea this planet is a caste world
I’m just another Captain Jack, searching for his Black Pearl
Last girl, I promise
You want commitment, and I want sex, let’s be honest
And kill the drama
...Nothin' but science on my mind list
Most don’t speak up and keep quiet 'cause they spineless
Try to define this
I’ll seek ideas to falsify like a scientist, until I’m 96

[Chorus] X 2
Watch them knock our place
And say it’s not our space
But we ain't going away
My whole camp stands unified (G U)
We ain't gonna kneel, cave, surrender, bow or move aside
They want to break us up
And want us back at odds
'Cause, we ain’t going away
Never this
They want the ground we’ve taken back and then recompense
We’ll resist
