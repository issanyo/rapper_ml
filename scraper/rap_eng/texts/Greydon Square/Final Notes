I got a transfinite number of rhymes
Intricately designed, intended to be unleashed one at a time
Archeologists recognize me as part of the find
Its amazing how you can't tell space apart from the time
As you approach the velocity of c the time gets slow
The farther you look, the further back in time you go
5's across the board everything is nominal
A creator causes cause and effect to fall like dominoes
These are questions and riddles that are yearning me
To look up at the stars, and stare into eternity
I'm just looking for the final equation is all
And I'd a be unsatisfied if the answer was god
A creator of the cosmos needs more than just a bad temper
His true nature coming in focus like a fast render
Tried to explain but your logic and your math centers
No where to be found like the Tea Party's black members

I don't want to be the average rap dude
My rhymes stay constant like light speed in a vacuum
Assembled in a DARPA lab
With enough augmentations to make a science fiction author laugh
I Assimilated the best part of your favorite rappers
With species 8472 and Borg tactics
Hack in to the digital drive, ransack it
Purge all the coonery songs, wack rappers
Take it back to spittin lyrics as straight passion
And revolutionize hip hop with mass action
Last thing i'll say about light you need to master
That only things without mass can travel faster
You and I can change lives without masters
Others want to sit by, wait for thine rapture
Make the check out to the church and fine pastor
Getting burnt like they was standing behind dragsters
Socialize with other minds might they might capture
With techniques of manipulation and fright tactics
You might ask if, a Christ who had passion
Would allow his dad to ask for murder as rite passage

This is the type of position you find ravaged
I'm only askin', the question that got passed ya
You respond with variant hate like Mike Savage
Til you gettin carried away like flight baggage

(x2)
Raw elegant rhymes based on hard evidence
From a vet of a war waged on false intelligence
Forged from torrent of racially charged prejudice
I'm trying to avoid going extinct ahead of them
