[Intro]
Yea, check (check)
Traumah unit freestyle session
Yo, check, yo, yo, yo

[Verse]
Look at these people lookin' at us lookin' back at 'em
They know that their future is ours and they know that we have 'em
By the balls, they feel there's no future at all
That's why they send us to battle, they try to kill us all
It's life and death in this ocean while you fight for breath
Play your cards a little closer or you might be next
They in this for the long haul while you want it done
They countin' on you not to vote while you havin' fun
It's close to November you better grab a gun
Before they get in office and say "you can't have one, son"
Then you shit outta luck
Cause when they come to take your block by force you givin' it up
I was trained by the best drill sergeants on earth
They assassinate characters so they target my work
While the usual religious critics target my work
These are just part of the perks, I wear these scars on my shirt
We are the future revolution and evolution of music
It's foolish; these record labels really think that you stupid
That you'll buy anything as long as it blings
And that you'll lead your favorite rapper shit as long as it sings
I wonder if our little money is cashable
They use the lives of friends and family as collateral
I fell asleep to mortars
No matter how you feel you gotta pull the trigger when they give the order
I know my mother worries for my safety
Don't worry mama I'll defend myself if they make me
Sacrilegious, pack the swisher
This ain't existence; I'm really back in the IT stacking dishes
These rappers claim they slappin' women
While praising god and thanking Allah in the after-sentence
Truth is bad for business; unrealistic like the depiction of Rome
I'll accept religion when kids get to pick their own
And fuck the approval of state boards
They spend our money on fake wars
And tell us to pay for it
