[Verse 1: Greydon Square]
I bet you Glenn Beck's magical underwear
That religion exists to take advantage of someone's fears
They still in my ear, like how you dissin
Jesus is the only man I know who can get nailed by men and be loved by radical Christians
In the lab, trying to lyrically get better
While your local churches send me out cease and desist letters
Your pastor warned you about me, the free thinker
The heat seeker, aiming at several weak preachers
I just want to leave my hand print
They call me repetitive and pedantic
When i'm the only one looking for answers
As a believer, I conceded there were evil and spells
Demons, I was fascinated with the end of the world
Even fascinated by the deepest regions of hell
Imagination can be crippled if you leave it to dwell
Hell they told me they took lies mixed it with Darwin
I used to watch Jack Van Impe and listen to Carmen
Holy cigarette companies act like I'm crook
The first bible I ever had was written like a comic book
That's no coincidence an easy target in the system
Wondering where the hell his family is cause he missed them
I prayed faithfully, as a soulless social worker
Showed up to snatched my only older sister away from me
Claiming she was crazy
My group home people stand up
My mother gave birth to me while wearing a pair of handcuffs

[Chorus]
You love my music until you listen to what I'm saying, see
You had my attention until you said you're gonna pray for me
So I might as well keep provoking and question everything
(People are tired of seeing faith used as a tool of attack)

[Verse 2]
This is underground, this ain't front page paper
And contrary to what you think you ain't safer
And there's a few Christians I respect like Frank Schaeffer
He might actually be able to save your late savior
Fear tactics to death panels in euthanasia
No wonder our kids are surpassed by the youth in Asia
Most of those kids have the education of 8th graders
No knowledgist information to be regurgitated
It hurts to say it, cause I really value education
But we must really want a stupid nation
And it's the same old story they kick
With two wars schools just ain't that high on the priority list
And it's the same war glory depicts
Stay stuck on the end of the world and we'll find a way to blow it to bits
Or am I the only one noticing it
Im tryna find somewhere besides the pulpit to sit
Compared to me you're a vegetable, you're susceptible
To faulty logic, while we make music for intellectuals
Today hip hop is a spectacle, a bunch of wrestlers
Workin ? ? with no testicles
Where's the knowledge at, the challenging of ideas
The arguments better be good you wanna challenge my peers
You wanna run with me don't get caught up with knee pain
Im chasin Canibus lyrics you chasin T-Pain
And it's sad the way our communities treat gays
Is the same way they treated the newly released slaves
Check these lyrics that you'll get scorched with
From Dawkins, Harris, Dennet to Hitchens I'm the 5th horsemen
Information addict so I spit eloquent
Until you can prove absolute right it's all relative
You keep saying hail Mary's and our fathers
But the world is waking up to the con-job of dogma
Wanna talk problems, shit don't even bother
Nuclear stockpiles still armed to launch all of em
And i'll tell you why people don't relate
We don't think deeply enough about the positions we take
We just believe whatever they say and take it on faith
And if you don't then you're betraying your race, what a waste
I salute the scientific method, verify it so there's no question, no guessin

(Chorus)
