Ha, I roll on your doo like bamboo
Man listen, Aknel stay in condition like shampoo
There ain't a man who can handle
Once I back slap you or clap you
Bullets in your skin like a tatoo

Now back to reality, you ain't as bad as me
I get down for my clan till they call me your majesty
Nigga fat as me still fuck with strategy
My dick stuck way up where her blatter be
But that don't matter see, I'll serve your ass like Andre Agassi

Fuck tennis, you dealing with a straight menace
Wailing on your ass like Venice
Well uh, got it sewn like a tailor
Float like a sailor, truck like a trailor
Scope with the [Incomprehensible]
All the above I've done the like Australia

Straight bailing you out, one call from jail
Aiming you out like Master P, that's what we be a about
I got ammunition for those dissing
This ain't R&B, that's why I'm skipping all that rip shit
I land one with the hand gun

You could go ask Charles and he'll tell you

My gun had bust many mans, watch many mans
Get swept the fuck off, there feet like dust pans
You get touched, man, messing with us man

My foot will lay you down to rest
And bless you with that Russell Simmons saint
And say thanks for coming out and God bless
Bow, fuck that bullet proof vest

I got hollow pistol leave you with the bullet infested in the chest
It's the Aknel, you know I rock well
I keep the gun point cocked like fucking barbells
Who the hell want to touch this veteran

Murder is the medicine, fine I'll stop the pedaling
Bullet in your brain leave your head in pain
On the ground you'll be laying reaching for exceteran ceteran, ceteran
But fuck that headache 'cuz you headed for a wake
I threw the gun in the lake, so they don't see me upstate

Now they don't have a clue and shit
Around the way I see your name written on the walls
Like rest in peace in you and shit
Your crew they ain't doing shit
Your mom's talking about the city had you suing it

Ha, I got the name Michael inbreded on the mack 11
They send punk niggas on the highway to heaven
You want to see God hit you with about seven

I might swing my hands like Macarena
