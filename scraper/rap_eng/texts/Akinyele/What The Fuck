[Verse 1: Akinyele]
It's the Ak that rock that freaky beats
Staying on the job like them niggas home from work release
I hear rappers talk like they're the hardest
Well, I be in jails trying to get bails to come over from the real murder charges
I put you in a hearse, kid
Rock with vanity virgins so fuck her right in the rhyme without the cursive
Huh, I get illy ripping this shit like a villy
You fish ass niggas, you best go free Willy
I recite paragraphs that'll razor label rappers who bite
So I can rip it from their ass to their appetite
You not ready for this y'all, nope
You silly dopes know that I cut your throats like Stacy Lattisaw
Rugged Man

[Hook]
(Cause we was up in the prison, prison, prison
Up in the prison
Rugged Man, what the fuck is going on?
Come on, word bond)
What the fuck?
(Rugged Man, what the fuck?)
What the fuck?
(Akinyele, what the fuck?)
What the fuck?
(Rugged Man, what the fuck?)
Is going on?
(Up in the prison, prison)
What the fuck?
(What the fuck?
What the fuck?
(Up in the prison, prison)
What the fuck is going on?
(Up in the prison, prison)

[Verse 2: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Yo, down with my man Akinyele, rock well east in L.I
I know the spot well, when we die we go to Valhalla, not hell
We vikings, see the way I trill, spit the real shit, don't care about selling
That's how shit is, I don't need shit, remix
Larry Holmes, 81 inches, that's what the reach is
Eat this, lay down, face down, stay down, way down
It's too late now, you ain't safe now
It's getting crowded as Auschwitz
You fuck without shit
How's this on some hillbilly down south shit, acknowledge
Rugged Man always bring the wild shit
I'm sick of big budget videos and shiny outfits

[Hook]

[Verse 3: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Some people hate us, some people love us
See us in the club getting fat bitches' numbers
I'm scared to get tested cause I never wear rubbers
The basics, break it, race kids
See us spray kids, dangerousness, dangerousesses
People too scared to walk where we live
You got beef, I'm at the crib
And I'll be waiting with my shorts off
Sitting on the porch with the sawed off
Blow your balls off, you all soft

[Verse 4: Akinyele]
Guys, you better recognize
I'm one of the illest lyricists that ever exist
So watch your back like Zorro
I take a toll on your ass like the crown Burrough
Fuck it, I'm thorough
Niggas better face the facts or get smacked
In the face with the gat
I turned pretty boys into Craig Mack's
Sometime it be's like that
The name Akinyele remains a true remaining fact

[Hook]
