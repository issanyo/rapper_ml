[Intro: MIKNASTY & Baby-D]
I don't know who you think you are
I don't know what you think this is
This and that, it's all you say
Like really? Like really though?
I don't get you
This isn't a game, like
I'm not playing with you
Listen to what I'm saying
You think it's all flowers and peaches huh?
I'll fucking smack you so hard that you see stars
Make you think you're in space
How's that sound?

[Verse 1: YOSHUA]
Well, maybe I don't wanna talk about the bullshit
I don't wanna hear about a thing
If it's affecting me
You gotta see priorities I have need of, bruh
I'm here for the fun of it
I'ma make you run for your money
Draped in my jacket, swear I look so stunning
Ain't it funny how a year go by
Feel like three months passed though, why?
I don't wanna waste none of my energy
These days, feel like friends are my enemies
Think my ego got the best of me, chopper on me
Think my downfall was my narci-cessities

[Hook: YOSHUA & MIKNASTY]
Oh, you telling me, huh?
But these days I'm cleaning up nice
I don't care no more
I pulled up twice, and
Hopped out, brand new look
Shopped out, for them books
Run up the numbers, I count up my money quick
I pull up, and then I split

[Verse 2: YOSHUA]
Wigs, heads, I don't care (yeah)
New chop, bet they stare (uh)
Glowed up, the brand new boy (ooh)
Glowed down, I miss my hair (damn!)
I miss a lot of things like the
Summer '17, when I fulfilled my dreams and
My nightmares too, huh
My face turned blue, huh
Choking on my emotions
November, my mind got blew
I was drowning in that ocean
I was up there floating, in space with the stars
And the spiral galaxies, man, I blew up wide open
Like Jupiter, gassed up, man
Deflated now, here's to hoping
That I get more of that gas
I get pumped up again fast
'Til my line go flat, pitter-pat
Hear the rain on the rooftop, chitty-chat-chat
I go back 'til I see that time when I feel that
Grind on my pelvis, I thrust it like Elvis
I chill, exhausted by all of those thrills, real shit

[Hook: YOSHUA & Baby-D]
Boy you're really tripping
But these days I'm cleaning up nice
I'm way too good for you
I pulled up twice, and
Hopped out, brand new look
Shopped out, for them books
Run up the numbers, I count up my money quick
I pull up, and then I split

[Verse 3: YOSHUA & MIKNASTY]
Harder than merging on the highway in California
Hope them hoes ignore ya
I milly rock in Magnolia, these brown eyes sure stole ya
Snatched your soul, I caught you unawares
Finesse the same as any, with some flair
I pull up on your lawn and park it there
So lovable that I could hug a bear
I'm eating lechon while showing how I'm on
Ain't nobody calling on my phone
Don't call me no more
I'm done

[Verse 4: YOSHUA]
They wanna talk to the man (man)
I'm on the avenue skrting on casualties, I got the wheel in my hand
I'm from that tropical land (P!)
I'm with the palms and the beaches and in every season
It's sunny, good greetings, I'm tryna make bands
I'm all introspective, need cutting and weeding and
You curling your toes in the sand
Law of supply and demand (cheese)

[Hook: YOSHUA]
But these days I'm cleaning up nice
I pulled up twice, and
Hopped out, brand new look (brand new look)
Shopped out, for them books (for them books)
Run up the numbers, I count up my money quick (real quick)
I pull up, and then I split (skrrt)

[Outro: YOSHUA]
You gotta know
I got rips in my soul
I got cracks in my windshield
And my heart got froze
I was kicking down doors
Didn't do what I was supposed to
But these days, at least I'm trying
I got God right beside me
