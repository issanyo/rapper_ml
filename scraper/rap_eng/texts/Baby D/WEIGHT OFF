[Intro: Josh Man]
KAYTRANADA
BADBADNOTGOOD
This that fushion joint
Yeah

[Verse 1: Josh Man + Baby-D]
Killing these tracks, killing the game for ya
I'm in a play, hop off the stage for ya
I'm an author, I'm turning the page for ya
I got it locked, I'm throwing my shame on ya
You got me bent, I'm throwing all shade on ya
Pay the rent, or I'ma blow up a 'nade on ya
You got a problem, please go ahead and say something
You not gon' say something? Then sit down and say none
Two in the air, feet on the ground (weight off)
Tell Pharrell and Hugo I'm seeing sounds (weight off)
Sixteen years on this earth been a mound (weight off)
Talk trash, better dash, I'm throwing down (weight off)
Head in the clouds, talk of the town (weight off)
I'm simply the flyest FilAm around (weight off)
It's uncontested I'm the greatest, I know (weight off)
Ask anyone who got the chilliest flow (weight off)
I do not care what you say, you a fake bro (weight off)
It's off your head and it's onto a plate bro (weight off)
You scared of me, I get it, it's just fate bro
If you want a chance at the throne, you gotta wait though

[Bridge: Baby-D]
Wait on it
I ain't even glowed up yet
This level two, I'm not done

[Hook: Josh Man + Baby-D]
Two in the drink, one in the sink (weight off)
Better not spill that sauce on my mink (weight off)
Visual contact, give her a wink (weight off)
Most of y'all bars and beats are weak (weight off)

[Verse 2: Josh Man]
I'm in the air, I'm passing supersonic speeds
I'm not of this earth, I'm part of another league
I stay humble, I'll always put on my team
I get high off life, I don't smoke the weed
It's none of this here "Gimme the ganja"
I'm a beast, Frankie G, I'm a monster
Judo Joshie on 'em, none of y'all want some
Look at me stunting on them, I am so handsome
This not for the fakes, homie this is for the mandem
I took the game hostage, I need a ransom
This behavior you exhibiting too wanton
This fire way too hot, we need a fandem
Aye, aye, yes Lawd

[Hook: Josh Man + Baby-D]
Two in the drink, one in the sink (weight off)
Better not spill that sauce on my mink (weight off)
Visual contact, give her a wink (weight off)
Most of y'all bars and beats are weak, stay soft
Weight off
