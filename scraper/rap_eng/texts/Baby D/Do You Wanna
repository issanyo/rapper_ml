Do you wanna make love

Do you wanna make love
Dah, do, do you wanna make love
Do you wanna make love
Do you (Come on) wanna make love

[Baby D]
Ma don't act you know how it goes 75 double o with a hole in the roof
Put on some Marvin Gaye so we can get lose
You just met me, well I just met you
No time to waste or no time to talk
Get a couple of friends so we can set it off
In the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn or Mariott Suite
You know i'm-a freak wit' it
Late night creep wit' it
At home while yo' momma in the bed
She sleep wit' it
Got game fo' day's
I got you mind all in amaze
And she slept the night away
In the skinny it be the game we play
So make a choice
Lil' Chopper Toy I be that boy
Baby be that boy
Do you wanna make love

[Freddy B and Baby D]
(Chorus 2)

[Baby D]
Do you wanna make L-O-V-E-
To me
All night long, no sleep
Do you wanna have sex wit' me
It's like ecstasy
I'll make you swish you'  toes
Make you' body roll
Late night---creepin'
Two-way beepin' all on my mind
As i'm freakin'
Pullin up to yo' crib on some dub's
Smellin' like smoke comin' just from the club
But it's alright, it's o.k
Do you wanna make love anyway
How you like it from the back
Holla at me I can work that

[Freddy B and Baby D]
