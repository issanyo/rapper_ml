[Baby D]
She was looking so good when I saw her in the mall
Hair done nails done and all
Getting off the elevatior
Nigga had to pause
Got a woodie in my draws
Got her number(so I'll talk to you later)
Shawty do you wanna ride with me
Slip and slide with me
Baby tell me what's really on your mind
Anytime of the day is the right time
Call me on the phone
We'll be creeping in the middle of the night
Baby girl if the mood's right
Sipping wine by the candle light
I bet you never had a lover like me
Get you in between the sheets
Feel the heat as I kiss you from your head to your feet
So shawty what you say
Baby can you swing my way
Forever in a day
I will always say
Baby can we sweat this one more again

Chorus: Ebony Crom
Why why why Baby D
Why can't you be faithful to me
Listen boy

[Baby D]
5 minutes of action
Slow grinding on the mattress
Eye to eye with mine
Had an action for passion
Because I'm long lasting
See I wanna hit it quit it
Get (? ? ?) right
And I really didn't understand
Was it 'cause I'm a bigger fan
By the way she turn boys to men
She had me wanting to do it again
And again and again and again
But I'm a playa for life, right, tight
Then let's get it on
Where the phone let's bone
Keep it going all soft
I just come to break you off
What you want what you need
Come with me and freak your fantasy
Every night she be begging me please

Chorus
