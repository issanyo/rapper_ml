Every kind of Whichway we hit 'em, we shot 'em!

Ridin' down Simpson with the Cadilac wood grain
First phase, phase two, finna hit it up mane
Real players from the South, ride triple G mane
This is how we do it cut 'em up on the free way
Loko wanna swerve on me, put it up mane

This is how we do it in the ATL so

[Chorus-2x]
