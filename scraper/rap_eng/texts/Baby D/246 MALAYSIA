[Verse 1: Josh Man]
2:46 AM in Malaysia
Posted up in bed with my baby
Got the sheets on, lights off
With the flights off, take off
Shirt with the Kate Moss on it
I was up counting these hundreds
I was up counting this money
I ain't even flossing, take a red eye down to Austin
Texas for some breakfast, I'm not one to mess with
And my girl really in the cut steady checking
On anyone looking for trouble, y'all know that she see ya
I'm trying to keep her on my side, we off to Ibiza, like
We back up on another flight
Tryna go to Italia, or maybe Germania

[Bridge: Josh Man]
Ain't seen the house in about three weeks but I think it's good
To get out, get out, get out of the way
Get out, get out, get out of your way
Get out today
Get out, get out, get out, out today

[Verse 2: Josh Man]
I'm traveling so much, I could have my own show
On that live cable, I'm tryna make that Friends money
Tryna get this Benz running, I'm really not stunting
I'm really not funny, hah
Just touched down in LA, my belly
Craving that ramen, ring ring on the telly
Tokyo the next night, PHI for rice
Then I get it all right, yeah
Then I get it all right, yeah
We gon' get it all night, yeah
On time, yeah (246, 246)

[Bridge: Somegirl + Josh Man]
Boy, who do you think you are
Boy, who do you say you are
Boy, who do you think I am
Boy, who do you say I am
Who knew that we'd get so far
I'm glowing up like a star
I want you and that's a fact
My love, oh you can't count that
Boy, who do you think you are
Boy, who do you say you are
Boy, who do you think you are
Boy, who do you say you are
Boy, who do you think you are
Boy, who do you say you are
I want you and that's a fact
My love, oh you can't count that, uh

[Verse 3: Josh Man]
Ding dong, delivery, it's not DiGiorno
What's gotten into me, grill me like Shono
On another flight after that
I think we gon' go to Alaska
Kick it with the cuh, bicken' with the bruh
Get it on the floor, I'ma need some more
I'm off to France, je ne sais pas
Why I'm in a trance (ooh la la la)
Holding my hand (ooh la la la)
Why I'm her man, je ne sais quoi
Went to The Broad
Took my baby girl, I was speaking Francois
She smile when I call her mi amor, like wow
I'm feeling like a child, I been put on trial
Looks like I beat the case, bada boom pow
Every time I gaze her face, I can't help but smile

[Verse 4: Somegirl + Josh Man]
Boy, feel on my body, cock you like shotty
I'll be your shawty, baby
Think I'm falling in love, I'm not tryna nut
I just want your time
Come upstairs to my room, I could show you
The time of your life, I promise
I just wanna be with you, go splitting with you
Make no mistake, I'm honest
Why you do this to me?
You know I'll give you nani for free
It's not what I want from you, baby
I'm not tryna front on you, baby
If you insist, I could be your missus
Give you lots of kisses, ride you 'til night end
Girl, you don't get it, I'm not tryna fit in
I just wanna get you, ring you up, lick you

[Verse 5: Josh Man]
Who be the one that never front, I be number one
Grabbing her bum, I'm going dumb, got another one
I'm in NY, I milly rock, just another guy
Who be so fly, it's in my sock, oh another time
Arizona, around the corner, iced tea
She don't know that I want her, beside me
Why you tripping? Don't you know it's my mission
Wife you up, build a kitchen, have some children
Oh girl, I know that the distance between us
Is massive, but trust me, don't want nobody than ya
Don't want nobody than ya
You know, don't want nobody than ya
Girl though, I need you
You know I see you
246 Malaysia with my baby
246 Malaysia with my

[Outro: Baby-D + Josh Man]
If you say you want me, then show me that you want me
Boy don't play with me
I could have a new one by tomorrow
But I stick with your lame ass
It's funny how I be traveling the world but
I still can't see her
