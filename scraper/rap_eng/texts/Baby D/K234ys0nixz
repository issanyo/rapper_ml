[Verse 1:]
Diamonds in my blunt thats how I be blowing money
Oops, I didn't read your tweet cause I was getting money
It's funny where I pour up in the same club that you
Ho up
And when I look into your eyes I see you looking tore up
You ain't gonna find a bitch that goes as hard as me
She said she drink like a fish but she drowning in the sea

Can be real if you faking the games that we playing

[Hook 1:]

And we're pushing on your buttons cause your man wish he was fucking
