(Intro - Blazed.)
Where my hustlers at, it's time to get down?

[Chorus - Blazed] X3
I'm bout money, bitch I'm bout money
I'm bout money, bitch I'm bout money
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm bout money
I'm on a chase for that paper

(Verse 1 - Baby D.)
I'm bout money it's M.O.B
Bens, Grants, that's all I see
Brown paper bag, pass that to me
Grab that duffle bag out the backseat
Die for the cheddar I carry that llama
Stack it in the winter so I shine this summer
Yeah, what you really know about that?
I come like self bring a little back
You want to build a stack?
Nigga what's that?
At least spend ten so I can get a good pack
I get gwop, understand that
I'm way in the front, y'all way in the back
Give me my keys, you not valet
My Maserati, your Chevrolet
Haters can't stop me I'm on my shit
I love gwop, baby that's my bitch
And
I always give back to the hood nigga
When I roll through they say Baby D's a good nigga
Feeling good nigga
Looking good nigga
Put your knot in the air if you're a money go getter
Ball
Now I'm up haters
Ball
Black stone, black chain I'm Vader
Fall
Hell naw not me player
Call
Me if you about that paper

[Chorus - Blazed] X3
I'm bout money, bitch I'm bout money
I'm bout money, bitch I'm bout money
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm bout money
I'm on a chase for that paper

(Verse 2 - Baby D.)
If you bout money
We bout money
Throw it in the air
Make it rain hundreds
I get gwop
Monday through Sunday
Never sleep on me
Never seen me coming
Check my resume, your boy top notch
Take it from the rainbow straight to the pot
Think I'm broke?
Nope I'm not
Pants on my ankles, that's that gwop
Then, Oomp sat down with Koch
Made them a promise we'll never ever flop
Came from the bottom straight to the top
Nigga
Ain't been the same since Pac
Look around this motherfucker a lot of niggas shocked
While he out he take my spot
Down
A lot of niggas left but I stayed
Down
Make you bow down nigga give that
Crown
Never met a nigga like me
A-Town fresh, Gucci from my head to my feet
Ten toes, stunting on my Bunyan
I wonder how long you can keep them on you
Funny
I see a nigga laughing but ain't shit funny
Straight to the bank I'm counting my money
"A-Town's Secret Weapon", yup I'm coming
Big Oomp Records got to keep that bumping
