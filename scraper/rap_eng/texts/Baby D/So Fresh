Oh shit , there goes trouble again
It's Young Dizzle puttin' on with his doble met twinz
That's why we come in matching Benzes outside the lot
They call me "Dope Boy Fresh" cause I keep them rocks
I keep rocks in my chain , and rocks on my watch 
Rocks in my ears , and rocks on the block , watch
A high search strip down in a mach - city on a Monday night
And make the club strip down
Now who you know stayin' fresher than me?
I keep 5 on my ass and a G on my feet
I get every pair of J's before they hit the street
And on the real you goin' think they all sponsorin' me
