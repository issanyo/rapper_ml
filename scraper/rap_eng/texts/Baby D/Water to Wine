[Intro: Josh Man]
Ooh baby, you so fine, love you good now
Baby girl, rock your world, rock the bed (blow!)
Deep as a canyon, peculiar fashion
The fruit of your passion, we ready for action
You could turn the water into wine
Ooh, we gon' have a mighty good time
I need it, wheel it, I feel it, you on my mind
Switch on ignition, just know I fit you right, yeah

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Ooh I feel it in my chest
Tell me if you feel it, tell me if you feel me
I can't even catch my breath
Boy I know you hear me, livin' in my fear and
Pour it all along your flesh
Pour it all along your flesh

[Verse 1: Josh Man + Kali Uchis]
Ooh, look at you, my baby boo, in baby blue
I get on you, I finish you, you 'round for two
I won't be here for it, mi-i-ine
You looking so fine, it's not fair, baby
My self-control breaking down with that stare, baby
Keep on counting the ti-i-ime
I'm on, you riding, we gliding, I need a suit
'Cause I'm in space, I can't believe it
You want me, I need to hear from you
I think I'm in love with you
I go down, I'm into you
You've been so patient, I know you been waitin' here
Been waitin' for so long
Don't let me waste it, I will slip away
(Don't let me slip away)
Just like the snow, no I don't die, I disappear
(I'll disappear)
Just hold me close so I won't slip away

[Verse 2: Josh Man + Kali Uchis]
Ooh, a mijo fell in love with you, mami
You heating up the place, it's so wasabi
Am I good enough?
Sunflower, baby, rev me like a Grotti
Cock me like a shotty
I don't know if I am
Got you on the floor and I see you go hotty totty
Is that good enough?
Switching up the rhythm, I slow down and then I speed it up
Feet is up, sweetie uh, you on me, I'm breathing ya
I don't know
Feeling all up on you baby, you tell me to keep it up

[Chorus: Kali Uchis + Josh Man]
Ooh I feel it in my chest
Tell me if you feel it, tell me if you feel me
I can't even catch my breath
Boy I know you hear me, livin' in my fear and
Pour it all along your flesh
Pour it all along your flesh

[Verse 3: Josh Man + Kali Uchis]
Ooh, my my, I'm a quite lucky guy
Keep on chasing the si-i-igns
Heavy sigh, I reply, with a wink, don't know why
You chose me, you's a dime, you so fine, and you mine (woo)
Yes lawd
I can make angels out of apes
You made one out of me, mon amie, mon cherie, you pretty
I can turn water to wine
Girl, you fine

[Outro: Tutu Gangsta, FORREST, *Baby-D*, Matt Man & (Jaycee)]
Something about her man
You zone out whenever you think about her
Dude, she got you cuffed bro
It's over for you
*Just slow down a little man*
Are you paying attention to what we're saying?
You're thinking about her again, huh?
Yeah
(This nigga)
