Part 1: Her

[Intro: lil bug, Nicole, Baby-D & (Queen Meg)]
Look at her
Who is that?
Who is she?
She can work
She look flat
(Girl, you just jealous)
No I'm not
Okay, a little

[Verse 1: Josh Man]
When I done seen her, I had to meet her
She was on the floor dancing, she was the feature
She was the star, and she didn't know it
She was so far, I had to get closer
Walked up to her, said
Hey, I know this unsolicited
But I saw you from across the rooming, and
I just wanted to say you're beautiful
I know this feel like biz as usual
But hey, wanna say that you made my day
When you did that shoulder lean, with the booty cheeks
Sugar honey ice tea, you too bad for me
She said, "I disagree, you way outta my league"
Wait what? Time froze
What did she mean? I don't even know
I'm like a four, a six on a good day
She like a straight eleven on her worst day, but she's

[Chorus: Josh Man]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
Everything that's perfect, you're everything that's perfect
Everything that's perfect, I swear that you are worth it
I know that you are worth it, 'cause baby girl you're perfect
You're everything that's perfect, damn

[Verse 2: Josh Man]
Super thick young mami who just keep on looking at me
I say, I say "Hot dang! I think this is love or something"
She say "Ooh that boy cute"
Her friend say "We been knew"
But I had to step out 'cause I got a girl too (maybe?)

[Verse 3: DJ Jarome]
I'm Jarome and I'm back, one time
Back in the club, then again, two times
Talked to that girl about three times
Slipped me her number, said "Hit my line"
Like whoa man, she's fine
I'm coming up, that's all mine
She want to dance, what a night

[Bridge: Josh Man + Matt Man]
And then we sped off, into the night like a phone call, like yeah
I did that, spent the night at my crib, that's like ooh
We kicked back in my living room, just chilling, I was like yep
She's so cute, that's all her (That's all you? Word)
Yeah man, we were just kicking it
She was tired after that long night
So we was just chilling upstairs in my bedroom watching Netflix
She had my PJs on 'cause that tight dress
Wasn't working out for her
It was cool man, just kicking it
And then, uh... *Laughter*
Yeah anyway man, how was your night? Was it alright?

[Verse 4: Josh Man]
Her style, her laugh
Her body, her dance
The way she get down
I just can't keep frown
Her eyes, her charm
Her smile, so warm
She make me wanna be a better person
I been looking for someone
But I ain't found nothing yet
I'm tryna be in a couple
But I gotta better myself

[Chorus: Josh Man]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
Everything that's perfect, you're everything that's perfect
Everything that's perfect, I swear that you are worth it
I know that you are worth it, 'cause baby girl you're perfect
You're everything that's perfect, damn

Part 2: End To The Summer

[Intro]
Hey, like hey
Just get it in, like hey
Hey, like hey
Just get it in, like hey
Like hey, we making moves by today
Just get it in, like hey
Just get it in, like wait—

[Verse 1]
Saw you standing there, I just had to come and say hi
I want to make conversation
Hope you won't take this the wrong way when I say
You're beautiful, you all that
You cooling too, you all that
Unusual how you get down
Freaky on the floor, like you losing motor function
Way you spinning, I'm surprised you ain't lost your lunch and
I'ma stop talking, let your body do the rocking
How you awesome and you saucing, everybody just watching
Do your thing girl, go and do your thing
Aye, do your thing girl, go and do your thing

[Hook]
This a good end to the summer
This a good—this a good end to the summer
This a good end to the summer
This—this a good—this a good end to the summer
Aye, I know fall—I know fall coming
But this a good—this a good end to the summer
This a good end—end—end to the summer
Aye, this a good—this a good end to the summer

[Verse 2]
Aye, why they wanna trip on my vibe?
Why they wanna kill on my vibe?
I'm just tryna ride, I'm just tryna get her inside
I just wanna try, I ain't tryna lie
Aye, girl you know you looking fine
I'm just looking for a good time
Aye, aye, girl you be staying on my mind
You be always staying inside
I'm like whoa, never met you before
But for some reason, I feel like I known
You all my life, you timeless
I'm just rhyming, I'm just talking how I feel like, aye
It's September, it's the end of the summer
But you could make my days sunny even in the winter

[Hook]
This a good end to the summer (it's what?)
This a good—this a good end to the summer (it's what)
This a good end to the summer (like yuh)
This—this a good—this a good end to the summer (aye)
Aye, I know fall—I know fall coming (what's what)
But this a good—this a good end to the summer (aye, yuh)
This a good end—end—end to the summer (yuh, yuh)
Aye, this a good—this a good end to the summer (like yuh)

[Outro]
Baby girl, what's your name?
You something I never seen
I'm tryna get you, I'm tryna slide
It's on my mental for you to be my wife
I'm tripping, ain't I? You out my league
But give me chance, we could make a team
Two lil' bubbas causing trouble for their momma and their daddy
We could be happy, girl you laughing
I see you, I feel that
I need you, believe that
Yawk!
