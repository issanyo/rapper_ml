Oomp Camp Productions !


[Chorus - Baby D]
We did it on the roof top
Did it in the rain
Did it in the cut, baby!
Tell me, is you game!
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
Menage with your girlfriend
Every other weekend
All on the plane
In the bathroom freakin'
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?


(Verse 1 - Baby D.)
Too much that we ain't nothin' baby, we done done it all
And when we hit the club, girl, you know we gotta ball
And lean on the fuzzy when we tearin' up the mall
We pull up in a coupe , playa there they go , guitar
And everybody looking, cause they know were superstars
We switch up everyday drive a different foreign car
Got a pocket full of money, in the club and by the bar
Got a couple bad bitches with their mouth on my cigar
I took 'em to the room and I fuck them both off
I hit 'em with the flex, now the bitches can't walk
I put on for my city, I'm that nigga , real talk
Oomp Camp All-Stars, Baby D Im a boss


[Chorus - Baby D]
We did it on the roof top
Did it in the rain
Did it in the cut, baby!
Tell me, is you game!
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
Menage with your girlfriend
Every other weekend
All on the plane
In the bathroom freakin'
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?


(Verse 2 - Baby D.)
I bet there ain't any nigga dat could hit it like me
Gimmie, 15 minutes and I bet she's gonna be asleep
She's like Im going deep, so I gave her what she wanted
She let me hit that thang, so I busted wide open
She know I hit the better when, im drinking and smoking
And we on that Ceroc, baby, ain't no more Patronin'
I got her in the backseat, caught up in the moment
I bet she'll call me, every time when she want it
Every time that she want it, I bet she'll call me
She got that super, soker so she messed up all the shit
She do freaky things, though she said she ain't a freak
Just hit me at the mall we can do this on repeat


[Chorus - Baby D]
We did it on the roof top
Did it in the rain
Did it in the cut, baby!
Tell me, is you game!
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
Menage with your girlfriend
Every other weekend
All on the plane
In the bathroom freakin'
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?


(Verse 3 - Baby D.)
I can change your life, baby, it won't be the same
I rock with Team Dizzle you can play if you can
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
Getting freaky in the car, on the dull Atlanta sun
And when we done lickin', i make her body shake
Spread whip cream on it, eat it up like cake
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
Menage with your girl
We can both have fun!


[Chorus - Baby D]
We did it on the roof top
Did it in the rain
Did it in the cut, baby!
Tell me, is you game!
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
Menage with your girlfriend
Every other weekend
All on the plane
In the bathroom freakin'
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
What can we do, What can we do
We ain't never done?
