Part I

(Sky)
As he casted over the mountains and land…his back turned with a lack of graciousness…his eyes covered by his frames. Like streams of sadness, tears manifest upon his cheek. Thus the land felt the darkness of the night, as The King disappeared for his time of plea. The sorrow melting like slow honey in hot tea, he spoke his words carefully, with his voice of silver

(The Sun King)
When you look into my eyes, do you fail to realize?
I’ve been played
I’ve been played
You put a shotgun to my chest
And you pulled with no regrets
I’ve been played
I’ve been played
And now I have to walk away
Because I have nothing to say
I’ve been played
I’ve been played
(Oh Melody)
I’ve been played
I’ve been played

Part II

(Sky)
His cries called the clouds. The rain and thunder danced as his emotions crumbled like the crack of lightning. His father son heard the calls; he breathed his wise words to him. To remind him of who he was; to remind him never to fall into the darkness

(The Sun King + Matthew Fairchild)
And though the rain keeps falling down
I know the Sun won’t wash away
And though the rain keeps falling down
I know the Sun won’t wash away
And though the rain keeps falling down
I know the Sun won’t wash away
And though the rain keeps falling down
I know the Sun won’t wash away

Part III

(Sky)
Hence the storm of depression passed. I made myself clear in the morning, giving him opportunity to shed his light. And he lifted to the highest height, only to shine forever

(The Sun King)
Take the chance my Sun
Take the chance my Son
Oh, take the chance my Sun
I said hey, take the chance my Son
My Sun
Yeah
Oh
Here comes The Sun King
Here comes The Sun King
Everybody’s happy
Everybody’s laughing
Here comes The Sun King

(Sky)
In the name of peace, love and happiness
Knowledge, wisdom, understanding
Mind, soul and body
He rose
Enter: The Sun King

(Mother Earth)
Wake up my Son
Es tiempo de empezar tu día

(The Sun King)
Over thinking causes the astray actions. I go into this coma of thought, in which nothing exist but my assumptions and insecurities

(Queen Universe)
So…when you say you’ve been “played”, what are you talking about? Who are you talking about?
