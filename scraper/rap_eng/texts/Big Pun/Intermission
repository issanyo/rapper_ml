Yo, this is the intermission
So go get some pot and get high
And when you turn to the next song
We'll sing about it, well, I will give you and example
Yo big pun whats up, nigga?
Why are we waiting in this intermission?
I dunno, nigga, I heard that I had to tell the peeps
Listening to get some pot and get high
No that's illegal, you are suppose to tell them
To go to the bathroom, oh, well, I didn't know
Oh, well, let's just go sing, okay, nigga, let's go
