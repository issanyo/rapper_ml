[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Skip the talk, pull ya guns out
That's when the bitch comes out
The dark, from ya heart, I'll slit ya throat and pull ya tongue out
Fuckin' wit' the best, I'll burn ya flesh 'til there's less than teeth
Dump ya bones in [?]
Peace, hope ya rest in grief
Left the reefer on ya grave and autographed
The Big Dog, slaughters pastors during mass, I don't support they masters
Meaning God, I'm hittin' hard as hell
Niggas be givin' the law an L
When I get finished I'm brought back to life but harder to kill
Still I will remain the pain inflicter
Givin' ya hell to reign the victor
Comin' to get ya, playin' the game the same as Hitler
You picked the wrong nigga to fuck wit'
Talkin' that tough shit, ya couldn't have been a bigger faggot if ya sucked dick
Duck quick and catch a hunnid in ya temples
If ya blunted, test the mentals
And be found drowned wit' just cement shoes
BITCH

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
Brothers are rappin' like Iraqian soldiers
Actin' like they crackin' boulders
When they pack a cap that won't attack a blowfish
Always talkin' shit, players that rather bark than pitch
And often counterfeit, Kings of New York
On Mr. Walken's dick
You make me sick to my stomach, you don't really want it
Riffin' like you sniffin' coke
To scare me but you barely blunted
You really done it now you got me mad
Morenos be like, "Papi's bad,"
Makin' fakers cocky when I'm drivin' back
Stop and laugh, that shit was Buttafuoco
Niggas run like Pun's the cuco
You gon' tell your puntos how I blew, you punto
You don't ever wanna clash again wit' Big Dog
The master and will never latch, rappers will you pass the 10
