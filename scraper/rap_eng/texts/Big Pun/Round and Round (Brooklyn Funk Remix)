[Intro: Big Pun]
Uh, no doubt, Brooklyn Funk, Ysae
Terror Squad, worldwide, no doubt
You got the Big Pun, Boricua number one
Yo, the Big Pun, Boricua number one
You got the Big Pun, Boricua number one
Yo, Mary J., let me get some

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
I just don't understand
What is your master plan?
What would you have me do?
Confusion in my mind
Been hurt a thousand times
Now I know you're not true
(That's why I can't be with you)

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Do you know what it meant to me
Just to make you happy?
All this time I've waited
Now our love has faded
Please tell me why it's gone
So my life can go on

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
(You will never know that I’m going ‘round)
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I told you once before
I'm walking out the door
I'm leaving you behind
Thinking ‘bout you all the time
Makes me so sad and blue
Now what are we gonna do?
(That's why I can't be with you)

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You don't know what you did to me
When you told me you loved me
Now you're actin' shady
Now I'm going crazy
Please stop holding back from me
‘Cause I got to keep from going ‘round

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
(Where I stop, you will never know, I’m going ‘round)
Round and round I go
(Gotta keep from going ‘round)
Where I stop, you will never know

[Verse 3: Big Pun]
Ave Maria, mami—how you gonna think of leaving your daddy?
We should be married, mami—why you always beefin’ at me?
We was happy before when we was poor
Now you platinum for your Latin amor still working at the mall
Maybe you deserve better
Saying I ain’t a herb…but you need someone more conservative
That’s only right since you were down to lust
Your body’s fine as (fuck), we intertwine with lust every time we crush
Defied you once on one occasion, you don’t need another reason to jet
But I regret that I wasn’t patient
You’re everything in my world; my queen and girl
The only woman I’d consider dropping my seed in for real
We shouldn’t kill something to hard to build
Our love was strong as steel, until I sent your heart to hell
Just call my cell if you’re feeling down or low
Until then, round and round I go

So don’t leave me—no te vayas, chula
Don’t leave me—you know I do it to ya
Don’t leave me—Big Pun, mami
Don’t leave me—Ave Maria, mami
Said don’t leave me—no te vayas, chula
Don’t leave me—you know I do it to ya
Don’t leave me—Big Pun, mami
Don’t leave me—Ave Maria, mami

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
(360 degrees, I’m going around)
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
You promised me you'd never leave
You said you'd stay with me always (Always)
Oh, you'd never leave

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
