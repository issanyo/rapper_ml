[Big Punisher]
Aiyyo it's funny dunn
The two nicest niggas unite as one
Collide the sun wit the moon, BOOM!!
I leave you brighted from
My full of clips, hawk the world into hell when a bullet spit
Crucifix myself to the sun, now who you wit?
Enter my world of doom, consume fear and feel the panic
I ram a lightning bolt between the earth and moon
And curl the planets
I'm pan-Atlantic wit lyrics spannin for galaxies
Battle me, mathematically, I'm givin your wisdom a cavity
Rapidly flowin, controllin the time
Flip over the line, I'm blowin your mind wit just a flow and a rhyme
I'm Hogan in his prime, strong and fast
You can bomb and blast, c'mon, you'll still be on your ass
It's satisfaction guaranteed
Wit Fiction like Quentin Tarantin'
Kickin your baddest dreams, shit you haven't seen
I have to be perfectly honest
You should have an anniversary to acknowledge the way I work the ebonics
I verbally vomit on how much niggas try to get us
With garbage lyrics, my style delivers it as the Outer Limits
I'm like the pyramids cuz every point is precise
Now you know me for life
Six Pun, Cuban flooded wit ice

Chorus [Big Punisher] (Milano)
If I ain't home wit my fam (Where you at?)
Stash crib, cuttin grams (Where you at?)
If I ain't deep in some ass (Where you at?)
I'm in the jeep wit the stash (Where you at?)

[Big L]
Check it, my whole crew holdin
We all got rides wit extra features
It's a bunch of ya'll, one got dough, the rest is leeches
You probably mad cuz I be sexin divas
I should pull this pistol out and make you touch your sneakers
I'm on some cool out shit, but I will pull this tool out quick
And put some holes in your new outfit
You frontin hard cuz you whip a Range
But it's a 4.0, you nerd nigga, you heard Jigga now get your change
You ain't a willy you a small soldier
Give it up son it's all over
And you never sold a, pound of cane
You a clown wit fame, goin down the drain
All yo' shit sound the same
I'mma shine pop-o, cuz when you got dough your rocks glow
L got a hot flow that rap coppo
I'm Uptown's smoothest, my first album left you clowns clueless
Sayin I'm wack, you niggas sound foolish
Niggas hate to see L bubble, they'd rather see L struggle
Cuz what they sell, I'mma sell double
You wanna see rocks, then look at L's wrist
If you see me in the club drinkin Mo' that means they don't sell Cris, what!

Chorus
