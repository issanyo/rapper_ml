Aiyyo it's such a shame All these dick riders trying to corrupt the game  But what it bring, nothing but pain And one in your fuckin brain Ain't nuttin changed since the album I'm still whylin I'm still violent I've been waiting for this moment Like Phil Collins, for all my life I've been trifer than trifer Hyper than hype, when fighting to fight It's like, tonight is the night And I ain't even trying to let a nigga slide I've been dyin to get a gat I dared to try now prepare to die I rush your crib like Jehovah's Witness, blow up any Soldiers, infants, hold up, did you notice my heroic entrance? I'm so relentless in this field of rap, everything is real in fact Fully backed by bullies who be peeling caps I sack the rapper like linebacker, play my rhyme backwards You can hear the Devil speak his mind with fine graphics Things get drastic, Express for my plastic I pack clips, between my nuts and my fat dick
