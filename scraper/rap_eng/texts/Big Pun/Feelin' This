[Intro: Armageddon]
It's on now
Feel threatened by this
T-Squad
T.S
Takin shit

[Verse 1: Armageddon ]
We 12-cylinder-pushin' drug dealer-killers, we feelin' this
Tec-9s with silver clips, my set's town still legit
Ain't nothin' changed
You can tell I'm comin', cause the weather strange
Armageddon, the end of your life and whatever's in his range
Never mind the notion of saving the lives of your friends
Your sister, your cousins, your mother, even the [edited] are going
Ride with me through the levels of hell in this atrocity
Bust my gun at the heavens til an angel fell on top of me
He said his name was Michael and introduced me to evil acts like
Robbin' parties and pumpin' the shottie to keep 'em back
Nobody move, nobody get burst open
Just give up the jewels before your purse-totin'
Ass become the first smokin'
Pop shit on my records, you lock stiff in my presence
My Squad gets respected for cockin' the fifth in effect
Stick a chip in your [rectum] and pull your soul out your [asshole]
And all for gettin' cash with the blow I got from Castro

[Hook: Armageddon]
You gotta ask yourself how ill is this
Only my thug niggas feelin' this
All in the clubs they be killin' this
You love the way we rip a track
Where all my terrorist niggas at?
Show me some love, give me love
You gotta ask yourself how ill is this
Only my thug niggas feelin this
All in the clubs they be killin this
You love the way we rip a track
We take a little love, then give it back
We Terror Squad, Terror Squad

[Verse 2: Prospect]
I master this, when I throw shots and snap the wrists
Not inaccurate, niggas be actin' if I ain't immaculate
You packin it? Better be bustin', I'm steadily rushin'
Up in your crib with a wig and my metal heavenly trusted
You busted, but it ain't the cops
Turn your back, and like you saw death
Lost breath, I left you in shock
You was amazed how the Glock raised from the waist
Got blazed in your face, was about to drop maj[or] in the place
Chill like I did enough, cause real niggas hit 'em up
We'll leave it at that, for the paramedics to pick it up
This ain't a cartoon, I bring light to the dark room
And spark boom, step in my path, I leave a heart wound
Me pullin' out without bustin' don't make no sense
That's like D's lockin' you up and don't take no prints
Tell your man in the black you ain't like it when my cannon react
In one second, that shit'll blow your family back

[Hook: Armageddon]
You gotta ask yourself how ill is this
Only my thug niggas feelin' this
All in the clubs they be killin' this
You love the way we rip a track
Where all my terrorist niggas at?
Show me some love, give me love
You gotta ask yourself how ill is this
Only my thug niggas feelin this
All in the clubs they be killin this
You love the way we rip a track
We take a little love, then give it back
We Terror Squad, Terror Squad

[Verse 3: Big Pun ]
I thought I told you I only rap for the cheddar
Keep the Mac under the sweater, ready to clap any nigga
Whether on stage or in the gutter
I put you front page on the cover
When I pump the gauge through your blubber
You mothafuckas better get protection
I got a Smith & Wesson
Strong enough to launch you up with The Jetsons
Spacely's Sprockets, wanna face the prophet? Taste the chocolate
When I hock, spit on your grave and disgrace your Ma
So I lace the bastard, cock the Eagle, let it rumble
Get sent up, fuck it, I'll still see ya, buy the bubble
Lookin' for trouble? You've come to the right place
Pun's out the ice age
A caveman raised by a clan of white apes
An urban legend, in God's eyes the perfect seven
The first to get in the devil's ass with a verse from heaven
Reverse the emblem, he ain't ready for the logo
Now he cursin' and yellin', like a baby for his bobo
