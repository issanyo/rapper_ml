[Lord Tariq]
Yea, yea, one more time
Seventies shit, got the lean
Shit is leanin, it's to the left
It's just leanin, dribblin
Like he gave it a bag of dugy
Or a bag of that Tango and Cash
It's just leanin and shit, seventies (The Lord Tariq)

Aiyyo I been through many places
Done many things
Seen the eyes of many faces
From New York to Texas
To the faces on Rolexes
Not a racist or sexist
And the best is the Lord, none the less is Gunz
Nothin less than a Lexus
Bubble eye with V-V-S's
Trouble minds and troubled times
Stacks, I'm tryin to double mine
I'm in a six wit double dimes and a couple of nines
Me and tracks back to back, circle the block a couple of times
And we searchin for this nigga to try
I'm bubblin mine
If we don't get him now then we will in due time
I bust enough shots to kill him two times, I do crimes
I get caught then my mind's defined in my son's rhymes
Cause my thoughts stay runnin like thugs from one-time
I been through it under the influence
Bustin off I'm runnin into it
See me say he didn't do it
Put the nine to his mind and blew it
Cause some times I lose it give me a gun and I'll abuse it
Puffin with my family, my bitch, my money or my music
Makin killas say he's too sick when he do shit
But I'm on some new shit, and it's too late the fuse lit
I treat my nine like a new bitch
And the shit do kick, word

[Fat Joe]
Play rap loud, politickin business
Wit the crack crowd, fact file, funny how I never seen a rat smile
My last trial's one of the reasons why I rap now
But still could blaow any nigga actin irrational
Fuckin with me's worse than duckin police
After puffin some trees I'll probably be abductin your niece
Murderin beats since the days of permanent crease
Been around the block seen grams converted to keys
Aah Cartagena, breaks hearts in Argentine
My misses slugs to love me, my wife act like Anita
Terror Squad'll die for the cause even if it means blowin up things
And takin over City Hall
My shit is raw straight from the Panama shores
If the feds can't catch me then they make up a law
Can't take it no more, niggas is fake to the core
My state pen friends'll leave you broke and naked up north
Bet it all on the Terror Squad click from Forrest
Real Bronx niggas that's heartless that spark shit
Regardless, niggas shouldn't have tried that shit
That's why mothafuckas gotta die like this

I had a dream that a team had a scheme keepin the beam
On my head like a infrared he's dead, but I redeem
Now I'm back nigga, it's on nigga
Run nigga, Joe nigga, Pun nigga, Lord nigga
Gunz motherfuckers ain't really knowin I'm really goin
And feelin I'm showin that my main objective is Benz and Lexuses
Cop Rolexeses, get bigot in Texases
So fierce bitches they be callin me exorcist
Far from a devil, Im God I mean I'm Gunz
And I shine like sun, rhyme like none, find my gun
Got beef with this nigga with hits and shit
Chips and shit, run around here switchin shit
Tellin people don't play that, you gotta play this
Tellin crew you ain't sayin that, you gotta say this
You can't wear that, you gotta wear this
Well hear this, I'll go in yo chest and leave you earless, fearless
The only thing between us if you stop my cream
Is a Glock nineteen, and I'mma pop like steam
Tryin to stop me and mine from eatin you need a doctor
With a hundred gauze pads nigga to stop you from leakin
And a prayer from the deacon as you weaken
And words from the Funkmaster Flex dogs shouldn't have been reachin
There's only one Gunz, from what it's worth
That's me, that's it, buryin shit, right in the earth

Yo we the Bronx avengers, partners in these peelan adventures
We the monster niggas in your dreams
That be stompin ya senseless, so be consciencious
If you march against us I'mma call my gentas
And you nondescripters gonna have to face the consequences
We large percentage and you small change
Hittin niggas long range
Chrome gauge leavin niggas John Blaze
Crime pays if you nice with yours
The Bronx is where you fight for yours
Ice your cross, slice cigars, light cigars
All day, wildin, freestylin in the hallways
Broadway ain't got more drama than Watson off of Colgate
This ain't the old days shorties is bustin, ain't no fuckin jokin
Some nigga called me a German, I had to bust him open
My brothers holdin me down with heavy artillery
Chevys and Willys' be chilin in front of every facility
Joeys from Trinity so he reps Forrest
You could save the best for us
But you still better place your bets on us
The Bronx baby, where the best get blown
My restin zone, come on nigga test your throne
I'm blessed with chrome, so leave your vest at home
I don't aim for the chest bitch, strictly necks and domes
