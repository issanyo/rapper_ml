[Verse 1: Poetic Killa]

We the motherfuckin' soul assassins
Flow is golden yeah the coldest rappin'
Scarz, Rivers and Poe..yeah you know what's happenin'
Souls I'm snatchin'..motherfucker yeah we closin caskets
Lit up a blunt then I told 'em to go throw the matches
Ahh!
Laughin' through the coldest of moments
Still holdin' composure standin' tall the noblest soldier
Chip on my shoulder, nah you're fuckin' shoulders is broken
Shovel with the Devil cause you sold your soul for exposure
Sucker!
So keep playin' your part
What you made from it now bitch I made from the start
Ways I was taught..you ain't seen the days that I've marched
And my bars are cutting edge shit is state of the art
Yeah!
And every part of me crazy
Started not to give a fuck cause the drama don't pay me
Scarred and deranged, here to fuckin' slaughter 'em daily
You is a motherfuckin' clown bunch of Barnum & Baileys
Ahh!



[Hook: DJ Gotem]

Wha, what they facin'?
Ly, Lyrical warfare
Rap, rappers I'm bound to slay
Come through destroy you and your weak crew
Wh, Wha, What you gonna do?
Wha, what they facin'?
Ly, Lyrical warfare
Rap, rappers I'm bound to slay
Come through destroy you and your weak crew
Wh, Wha, What you gonna do?



[Verse 2: Chris Rivers]

Lyrical warfare the syllables walk here
Stockton fully loaded with this pivotal talk here
Got snipers in the verbs to hit the herbs with the forced snare
Or blow your fuckin' brains out with minimal thoughts here, check it!
There ain't no section flexin' weapons when they lips go separate
Stretchin' all these niggas second guessin' my two lips aggression
Pause!
Ain’t no fixed election, Trump cards get rip projections
Fist injections aiming at your jaws and teeth in six directions
Lord!
I been dedicating passion elevated rappin'
Past the point of celebratin' trap is all that ever happens
I’ve done demonstrated actions that could penetrate facts and
Separate the wack shit like a surgical extraction
It’s, Dr. Rivers conscious start headlockin' niggas
Drop a quitter quicker then mustaches drops from Amish niggas
No disrespect to Amish rock it like a comet hit ya
Only fuck with Nostradamus prophets i can’t comment with ya, Rivers!


[Hook: DJ Gotem]

Wha, what they facin'?
Ly, Lyrical warfare
Rap, rappers I'm bound to slay
Come through destroy you and your weak crew
Wh, Wha, What you gonna do?
Wha, what they facin'?
Ly, Lyrical warfare
Rap, rappers I'm bound to slay
Come through destroy you and your weak crew
Wh, Wha, What you gonna do?



[Verse 3: Scarz]

Look, armed with an arsenal loaded with arms and weaponry
Prepared to dissemble any artist that wants to step to me
Thus to be prepared runnin’ scared better fear the breath of me
Aimed and ready to pop like a coil that’s gets to testin' me
Bring out the best of me, pressing, ingesting the recipe
Deathly, every artist the hardest till they step to me why?
Because they less than me and it be the death of me
If every artist can see me if Scarz doesn’t leave with their eyes
Machine guns, hammers blaze
Land mines and hand grenades
The way I spit they’re gonna have memorials and damn parades
These other rappers spit I swear to God it’s boring me
Cause Scarz will swarm the game like the beaches back in Normandy
Cause I be spittin’ bars with facts, the fakest they can’t stand to hear
Cause Scarz be goin' harder with more ammo than a bandolier
Artists say that they can match but face to face their lips quivers
This a fuckin’ army, Poetic, Scarz and Chris Rivers



[Hook: DJ Gotem]

Ra, ra, rap, rappers I'm bound to slay
Ra, ra, rap, rappers I'm bound
Bou, bou, bou, bound to slay
Lyrical Warfare!
