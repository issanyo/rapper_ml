[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Why you rhymin like you killin' niggas, you ain't never feel a trigger
Screaming that you real but y'all still beginners
I make examples out you ample rappers, smack you make you trample backwards
Catch you fallin' flat than strap you back in pampers
That's a sample just to let you know, test me and invest in souls
Specially on some flesh meat, never left on skulls
No supposin' holding grudges, you'll be holdin crutches
Motherfuckers blastin' me that's blasphamy, I'm old to roughage
Who's the toughest as rough as they come, I'll snuff 'em anyone of ya bluffin'
My name ain't Punisher for nothing
Keep huffin' and puffin', I blow your face in
When me and Seis and my ace in the hole lyrical assassin be Triple Seis and
Chasing popo outta Puerto Town, Loco til I part the ground
In my coffin, tossed in, to the lost and found
Down and deep beneath the weather in my leather jae
Six feet forever, half asleep Bronx niggas never die

[Bridge]
The King
"The term Chino's Latin, but I got black soul
Flows I creates "Unforgettable" like Nat King Cole"
The King
"I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggas be swearin' I'm blacker than Cole
Like Nat King"

[Hook: Chino XL]
Two of the illest that you've ever seen, true Puerto Rican kings
Big Pun in Heaven making angels sing (The King)
Chino is still in the physical making your name ring
This collaboration is biblical, mythical, insane
Feeling the pain of any latin artist we brought change
Before the game was even called a game in the harshest rein
These two talented Tieno monsters maintain
Chino and Big Pun, a true lyricist dream (The King)

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
Capital X, capital L, slapping the veil over your grill
Slapping the world, I was found in a church well
Charred body smell going up your nostril
Burn myself with lit cigarettes, practising for fires in Hell
Still can't believe Christopher Rios is gone
I feel like beating these wack niggas to death with Big Punister's tombstone
Something sacred, pumping hatred, nothing shaken
Conversations how insatiable, villainous, untasteful impatient
Abrasive abusive like Gary Busey carry an uzi
Rubies and Kool G, chewy and Goochie, angry and moody
My life's a horror movie, y'all don't move me, go 'head shoot me
Murder malicious, you sleep with fishes, slice ya to sushi
I would've thrown Fred Astaire down a flight of stairs
I'm ghetto as having a fly strip for a chandelier, eeeeh
Then dying, better stand clear
I'm will.i.am to Wyclef, had a dredded beginning career
So Shakira Shakira feel the fear of God, I spit it hard in the fog
Flow is odd, my mic's religious as a synagogue
There's a lot at risk, open your lungs like Primatene Mist
Spit it, numb my lips like I sniffed a ton of Vicks
I'm from a bottomless abyss where no light can exist
I'm a riflist that's fair shooting out cares till my hands is breaking off at the wrist
My hate is out of order
Slaughter, but visual as drag queen pictures of Oscar Dela Hoya
