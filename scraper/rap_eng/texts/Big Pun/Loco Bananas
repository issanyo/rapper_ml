[Hook: Tony Sunshine & Big Punisher]

Loco, loco bananas
Faces of them follow us with their cameras
Yes, we're loco [Tony], loco bananas
Our Uzi's be blasting, we're truly assassins cause we
Loco, loco bananas [You wanna go to war?]
A couple of Tony Montanas
Yes, we're loco [Sunshine], loco bananas
We're worse than one time, Big Pun and Sunshine

[Verse 1: Big Punisher]

Shakespeare meets Leatherface
Cape Fear with a little bass
That's how it sounds when I'm in your tapes
My style in your face for real
Fresh out the gates of Hell
Welcome to the Bates Motel
The streets is real
And I'm about as real as they come
The sound of Atilla the Hun, killing every verse when I'm revealing the gun
Willing to thump with any adversary
Physically or vocabulary
Cause lyrically I'm only half as scary
Rappers fear me when they hear me coming
Cause I be really buggin'
Really clubbing them down
No time to be thuggin'
Lovin' the life
Huffin' the mic
Crushin' your wife, that's right
Cause nothin' ain't nice
Don't front with your life
Cause I'mma call your bluff
Big, tall or tough
They all fall when they brawl with us
So call in us if you need some protection
Couple crazy niggas guaranteed to leave an impression
My peeps is reppin'
Hittin' you hard with the goods
Cause that's what we do
Terror Squad for the hood
Straight out the ghetto
Keep your holster with a hammer
Cause niggas out here
Are straight locer bananers

[Verse 2: Big Punisher]

I'm Coo Coo for Cocoa Puffs
From new school to older thugs
They all know Pun for shootin' dudes at all the clubs
I know it sound crazy
Even my wife won't let me 'round the baby
But what you expect from a veteran out the Boogie Down baby?
I rep' NY like a vet Jedi
But my Light Saber's not a laser
It's the Tech Semi
So hold your horses
Or I'mma have to load the four-fifth
And leave a hole in your skull bigger than the Oval Office
No remorse is felt when a loss is dealt
Just pass the heat to Cuban and keep it movin'
In a Porsche flossin' the wealth
Fuck what ya heard
Niggas done see me rap
Wild West, Faces of Death
There from TV shit
World renowned
Even my girl get down
She'd rather die with a king
And go to Hell with the crown
Like Bonnie and Clyde
Helped me down when my mommy died
But she ain't really dead
But she ain't part of my life
She crazy too
50 years old, sportin' Daisy Dukes
Sick old lady, do anything to save her youth
But where were you back then?
You said you'd be back
This is why I smoke
Where the motherfuckin' weed at?

[Tony Sunshine]

Say ma ma ma ma ma ma
If you puff that la la la la
Say ma ma ma ma ma ma
If you love that la la la la
Say ma ma ma ma ma ma
If you puff that la la la la
Say ma ma ma ma ma ma
If she makes you la la la la
