[Chorus: Big Pun & Mr. Serv-On]
Big stun with the big guns
Serv-On get yo swerve on
New York to New Orleans
Shit is doper then morphine
Hit the streets gettin more creme
Making all the hoes scream x2

[Big Pun]
Ey man but the hardcore created of the side of momma boritore
Why keep all the war, shit store to seperate corridors
Songs drippin the art of war, sympanies by morely more
We got it all, pore, the squad follows the protocall
Speakin of protocall, I'm the protocall, when you go to war
Cause my death count amount to war overall, so don't abort
You can't handle the rock, I'm be standing a block
If you just hand me the Glock
I be the rock like enro, Glock like wino
Eye bumped, when your glocked get the drop top demo
What's the problemo, dose of espanol
Anything is stutterin is Pun, the da, da
No Limit, scared to death, you ain't got no hair in your chest
My shit is Chuck Norris, you look like two bears having sex
Gots it outta here, like Samson I generate my power and you outta here
I was around with two hundred bottles of beer
It ain't fair whoever said life was sweet, your wife with cheat
Everything was nice in the streets, advice of the week
Pack the biggest bottles of the pills on the shelf
And swallow the muthafuckers cause you better off killin yourselves

[Chorus x2]

[Outro: Mr. Serv On]
Shit
Nigga I done come motherfuckin two thousand miles
Just to make you bitch ass niggas understand
Uh, Terror Squad, No Limit
Ha ha, real shit nigga
Ha ha, soldiers, players
This nigga here
I got the biggest muthafuckin man on the coast nigga
Pun nigga, you fuck alot, I blast alot
Put that together nigga, ain't nothin but money baby
And number one and a fifties
You bunch of bitches
Bitch ass niggas out there
