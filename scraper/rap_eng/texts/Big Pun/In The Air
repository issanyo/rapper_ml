[Verse 1]

So . 
How can I go on knowing my fate?
Me & a demon in a black robe discussing setting dates
My heart pounding, mounting, I see disgust in his face
Behind this case, his decisions based off of my race
Every second minute hour devoured quicker than normal
Battling spirits in my mental, knowing I'm no mere mortal
To the state's attorney, understand I feel no ill will toward you
However, I can't speak for whether God will have mercy on you
My folks and family to whom this verse is dedicated
Faith & focus on which my success was predicated
Life changing obstacles on my road to get educated
Refusing to yield using this pen as my medication
Young black man, I'm always the one that they leave the blame for
The welfare of my family, who you think I bear the pain for
I'm irrelevant yet I'm the one they taking aim for
When I'm focused then I'm focused, and I'm getting what I came for

[Hook: LuLu]

I can feel it, all over
I can feel it, all over me
I can feel it all over
All over, all over me


[Verse 2]

Genuineness is vital, you really can't fake what's real
Go through your system and survive, yet you're hating me still?
Tribulations demonstrating how to win and I made it real
I wasn't in the car, so how could I let Jesus take the wheel?
Hindsight, twenty-twenty, almost immaculate what's after it
The vision tunnel, as a result, making me more passionate
They try to stunt your growth, job apps with an asterisk
The shits depressing, can't sugarcoat it no way you package it
Heart & money synonymous, they may get mad at this
People that have to say they got it usually be lacking it
I don't, therefore, I care more and work more
To whom much is given much is required, therefore it hurts more
God's mercy on the bigots who want to see me in a hearse more
Reminiscing on days when I used to go church more
Crooked clansmen in uniform in the Crown Vic's alert more
Want us in the jam or on the front of tee shirts more

I can feel it all over
All over
All over me

[Verse 3]

The community straining although we knowing we deserve more
Youngins with pistols and weed, that like to curse more
Leaders crippled by fear that don't allow them to be heard more
Legal action attacking bashing as the world turns more
Hope is like a crutch to those who yearn for more
Work ethic instilled young, I feel obligated to earn more
Communicating at my peak, I seem to come to terms more
Negativity and hatred, seeming to be spurned more
Children dying daily walking to school trying to learn more
Murder capital so mother's nightmares are confirmed more
The flame of senseless violence in my city seems to burn more
Police pressure and stress instead of protect and serve more
Quote unquote real niggas ain't sticking to they word more
Repetitive cycle, first-degree they taking turns more
Positivity to the wayside til we affirm more
Rest in peace Blessings on y'all try to be concerned more

[Hook: LuLu]
I can feel it all over me
I can feel it all over

[Outro: Keeko]
I can feel it in the air right now
Ain't no way I'll ever let them tear me down
