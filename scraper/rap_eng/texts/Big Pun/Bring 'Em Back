[Intro: Fat Joe]
Yeah, this is classic shit right here, vintage shit
Go get ya tape decks ready, uh
You know I had to bring 'em back hahahaha
Terror era's the squad man
Yeah uh yo uh yo

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Ayo I'm old school like Rick Ruler, sick jewels to big buddah
Lift dudes with the six shooter Luger (ooh yeeah)
That means bring it back, NY, king of that
The best tried to dead mine but just can't see to that
The 4th comin' don't look now there's more comin'
And we all stunners with lil' money but still hungry
True story, once threw a nigga from a two story
Asked for my paper said there's nothin' he can do for me
That's like takin' a steak out of a Lion's mouth
Better yet that like takin' a plate outta Ryan's mouth
That'll never happen over my dead body
Feds got me plastered on the wall like I'm the heir to Gotti
I swear to Mambo and NORE and all of LeFrak
A nigga try front on his body he gettin' sent back
Don't resent Crack I'm just what you wanna be
Young rich and famous, bitches can't get enough of me
And they runnin' up on me usually in groups of them
But not just everyday but you could never be too used to them
I be abusin' them, squeezin' fresh oranges
Breakfast in the morning get some strength and then it's on again

[Chorus: Fat Joe, Big L & Big Pun]
I just had to bring 'em back
Word you definitely know what I'm about
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
All my friends call me stout
I just had to bring 'em back
Flamboyant baby
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

[Verse 2: Big L]
When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
I'm quick to buck a duck and I don't give a fuck about 5-0
A hardcore life I toast to ex flaw
Therefore I live raw and went to war with the law
My only pencil was a mug shot slugs were thugs got pot
Get swellin' hops from sellin' tops to the drugs spot
G's was clocked fat knots was in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop got knocked when I popped the Glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
'Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight
'Cause we put the guns down and go one round
With the hands but man I ain't the one, you'll get done clown
I can inverse my style, 'cause I'm versatile
Quick to burst a child I'm livin' worse than foul
I pack two TECs in case ya crew flex
I wet up the set in a second yell who's next
To feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like Shaft
Turn ya staff into a bloodbath then laugh
You'll get smashed like a deli snack, you softer than jelly, jack
I attack in black wit a Gat and a skully hat

[Chorus: Fat Joe, Big L & Big Pun]
I just had to bring 'em back
All my friends call me stout
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
Flamboyant baby
I just had to bring 'em back
Terror Squad 'cause we stunt
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

[Verse 3: Big Pun]
No doubt I'm from the X and I seen it all
Shorties with dreams of playin' ball for Seton Hall turn to fiends and fall
From Edenwald to Sacuon the same sad song is bein' sung
Its like give me a gun and I'm back on
Joey Crack, Pun, TS, Bronx regulators
Stomp little niggas to death for tryin' to imitate us
Y'all could never see us, be us, TS, kill the B.S
'Cause Pun got more guns and funds than Undeas
Un be us, I'm from the BX so I have to roll
Blast the four, crash ya door, smash ya ho
Hack off ya skull, I'm stackin' heads like totem poles
Blow a hole in ya colon throw you from here to Fordham road
Blow for blow, I toe to toe with the toughest
Bring the ruckus to the roughest motherfuckers its nothin' but luckstress
My crews are cussin' to bustin' ass crushin' glass
In niggas faces leavin traces of red out this bloody bath
I want the cash off the jiddump, I cock and blast the piddump
At any piddunk tryin' to laugh at the Briddonx
You ain't no kiddon for the Terror Squadron
You feel the fear of God when I steal a car and flatten ya Pierre Cardin
I pierce ya noggin' if you startin' trouble, spark the dot above you
And watch it blossom like a flower throughout the borough
No doubt I'm thorough with a para scope rifle
It's the lyrical psycho that'll tear the whole Bible out
I'm sweatin' no idols a title's all I request
Best rappers know that Pun and Y, the chaperones of death..

[Chorus: Fat Joe, Big L & Big Pun]
I just had to bring 'em back
Word you definitely know what I'm about
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
All my friends call me stout
I just had to bring 'em back
Flamboyant baby
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
