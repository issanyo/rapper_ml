(verse1)
Why you rhymin like you killin' niggas
You ain't never feel a trigga
Screamin that you real but y'all still beginners
I make examples out you ample rappers
Smack you make you trample backwards
Catch you fallin' flat than strap you back in pampers
That's a sample just to let you know
Test me and invest in souls
Specially on some flesh meat, never left on skulls
No supposin' holding grudges you'll be holdin crutches
Motherfuckers blastin' me that's blasphamy, I'm old to roughage
Who's the toughest as rough as they come
I'll snuff 'em anyone of ya bluffin'
My name ain't Punisher for nothing
Keep huffin' and puffin', I blow your face in
When me and Seis and my ace in the hole lyrical assassin be Triple Seis and
Chasing popo outta puerto town
Loco til I part the ground
In my coffin, tossed in, to the lost and found
Down and deep beneath the weather in my leather jae
Six feet forever, half asleep Bronx niggas never die
