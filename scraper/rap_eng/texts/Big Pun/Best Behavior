[Intro]
We over here
Its the wild life...you heard?
Yo...yo Pun set it off yo

[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
I'll put the muthafuckin' blows like a pro supposed to
And hold a loaded toe for all the pistol smokers now initialed on my shoulder holster
You know the culture when its East Coast we run the streets most
Who want beef, turn your peeps into meatloaf
You know the steez, when its murderin' third degrees
We observe the breathe, and move with the wind like birds and bees
Word to Jeez, Christ I'm nice, go ahead roll the dice
You know the price, your kid and your crib like the poltergeist
I'm cold as ice, control your life with the mic
And then take your crown and break you down like liquid nitrogen
Invite your men, I'll strike your chin while you're rapping
I'll get on some Brooklyn shit, grab my clip and start clappin'
Make your heart flatten, stop acting retarded
All you flea hearted villains know you building off what we started
The streets are guarded heavily, where the violence doubles
Forty fives and shovels ready in the five livest boroughs

[Hook] x4
I keep tellin' ya'll (Be on your best behavior)
When I come through (Be on your best behavior)

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Yo be on your best quietest kept
Boy Ima fire this Tec
Blow holes through ya dome just for lying on ya rep
I'm sick and tired of the threats
To say the least, my niggas play for keeps
Cut the middle finger off your favorite niece
Blaze your peeps just for talkin' shit
So unfortunate you had to come across this clique
We been doin' this for years, ruinin' the fierce (kids)
Niggas never want to listen to the toolies in the ear
Feel the fear when you fuckin' with the Bronx finest
We old timers, get snatched and catch a case of Alzheimer's
These small timers be really thinkin' that we be sleepin
'Till they find 'em leakin' on the side of the Major Deegan
I hate to cease it but I gotta do it
For no reason spill your body fluid when my bullets travel through it
You down to do it, then stop frontin' the cops comin'
Ya'll niggas some bitches that never shot nothin'!

[Hook] x4
I keep tellin' ya'll (Be on your best behavior)
When I come through (Be on your best behavior)
