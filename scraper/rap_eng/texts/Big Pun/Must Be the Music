[Intro: Big Pun]
Fuck is up with the morning show
Big Pun in the morning show that's all I need to hear
"Big Pun what are you doing Pun"
Ed Lover, yo

[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Me and my thugs be up in the clubs layin' the law
While you looking bugged playin the wall
We're trying to cave in the floor
Havin' to ball with the ballers
Terror Squad niggas who want it
Even the biggest dogs acknowledge
Payin how much? We obviously gain dollars
Let's mananas without your everyday (?)
We make ballers take cowards of the top give me eight hours
I turn your powder into rocks, check the scenery
Glass table, mad cocaine debris, and bring a key
When you hang with me everything is free
It's my treat, my suite all expenses paid
All my friends can stay, cause this break is on emancipate
Nuthin more, it's on me butt galore, and head nut your balls
I'm makin money for these fuckin whores
Nice and raw keep it rugged fuck the bullshit
Skribble said it's all love as long as it's the new shit

[Hook: Big Pun]
Must be the music
(Turnin them on)
Must be the new shit
(From Cuban and Pun)
That's how we do it
(Big Pop is my shit)
Must be the new shit
(They'll never stop it)

[Verse 2: Cuban Linx]
Yo it's the lyrical fly guy, that drive by your block in the Benz
I be hittin skins while I'm givin all my friends high fives
I get live and tie your legs to my brass bed
Relax, get comfortable, then hump you through the mattress
Cause at this I'm a professional, the best in the world
That's why I got so many girls on my testicals
I like em flexible so be able to stretch
And sex gets incredible when the Cuban's on the set, I bet
I'll make you sweat like heat my Technics
Cause we from freak over feet on any day of the week
I keep a hicky, chicks pick me because they love the chinky
I kick a (?), I got them wrapped around my pinky, like Biggie
I'm "Unbelievable" this Cubanito keeps a full tank of diesl fuel
Just in case you need to go that extra mile
In sex I'm Wilder than Gene
And in between the sheets, im a show you just what I mean

[Hook]

[Big Pun]
I walk into the fuck-in Tunnel (I ain't a player)
Bitches on my dick and wan-na dance (C'mon)
I remember when it wasn't like that (Hold it up Pun)
You call me blimp but now it's baby fat, must be the music

[Hook]

[2x]
We'll keep ya hot till the, day light
We'll keep ya movin all through the night
