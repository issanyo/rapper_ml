[intro]
Aye Aye one take one take one take
OK let's get this right here
Uh-huh aye yah

[verse 1]
Jumping upon the pawns ain't no peace for pieces
I see the demons scheming deeming different people for eating evil
These greedy people aren't feeding equal
They eat the eagle and leave the people
Crumbs for their consumption they cheat the feeble
And beat the broken hoping they choke 'em with rope
Stressing their throat depression that chokes
Numb with no Novocain
Hold my brain while I go insaine
Chose the pain so you know his name
Open veins only slow the pain

[bridge]
Aye they could never beat me
Found freedom in faith aye aye

They could never keep me
My people is saved aye aye

Uh here's the fast part

[verse 2]
Seeing the difference I flow in the motion
I open a ocean of hope when I grow in the moment
I'm leaving division I rip in the rhythm
And all of the people they looking at me
I am a beast keeping it proper like I am a priest
Profit is stopping and stomping these monsters
I'm leaving them broken deceased

[Chorus]
Aye aye
Whatchu looking for
Aye aye
I just praise my lord

Aye aye
Whatchu looking for
Aye aye
I just praise my lord
Aye
