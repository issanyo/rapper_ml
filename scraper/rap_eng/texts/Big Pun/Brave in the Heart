[RaKalid - Verse 1]
You feel your heart Trembling? Hopping up then trampolining?
Walking through the timberlands The wood is in the frame
Never promise anything you can't maintain Like, When you tell yourself
Ima stop doing this, then continue doing it..You making false promises
You Lying on your grave
Un-tie your sneakers Take a seat and when you see us
You can sense the Leadership Without Even meeting us
Deleting that Deleting this.. Executive decisions
You know you feeling this..
Legendary manager, Being the f*c*inG man got advantages
Disappear to Canada ~~  A week-end then I head to Panama/
Ladies love the way we ~ Swayze
Never pay attention Cause Attention Pays Me
Try to live my life, Walk a kilo in my Ego
Sequeling the Pun into a basin while Im Blazing constellations
All across the Universe to Unify a nation that's ungrateful to the basics..Face It..
We all give less than, everything we taking...
Now This the TYPE Of music that'll make you feel stupid
Like you missing out on something matter fact you missing Everything
I ain't scared of nothing That's the scary thing
Not afraid dying.. I'm a strong believer in that
After my demise they will remember me as I am

[Big Punisher]
We brave in the heart, playin a part, amazingly smart
Razor sharp, futuristic raps, state of the art
Takin New York cats past the stars
First it was Nasty Nas now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low, business never personal
Just some words to know - if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him now they inject us with juice to fry 'em
Depends on the state if death is my fate then cool I'm dyin
If that's my destiny it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker that bent me right next to me
Aight crew? (No doubt Pun!) Aight then, let's fight then
I'm hypened, comin with the thunder and the lightning
Invitin the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, snipin your moms, right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm it's the ghetto God
I rip a nigga heart out his frame while I scream TERROR SQUAD
Be larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she'd starve on a diet instead I'm a God in her eyes
The father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzlin beer bottles by the dozen with Devin that's mi hermano
