[Verse 1: Armageddon]

I jeopardize this rap shit and blast your ass to prove a point
I got thug niggas that don't even rap callin' to do joints
You frontin' off the strength and you the weak link in the clique
It's obvious you're pussy I can see the pink of the clit
I sink the chip of my clip in my daily Desert Eagle
.44 mountain with heat open your belly like it's legal
Push your back off your feet, send you sailin' like a seagull
When we clash in the streets, why was you bailin' if you evil
You ain't evil, talkin' how somebody trynna playa' hate you
Actually I like you, but fuck with my squad, the German A.K.'ll hit you
Ever seen what those things can do to [*whip, scream*] your legs
Remove your [*slice*] from your hip down to your Tims
I'm like the limit on your life, the dimmin' on your light
The figure in the dark that takes your heart in the mid of night
This ain't a joke cause ain't nothin' comical how a laser scope
Aimed at your dome could erase the features off your face I hope

[Hook: Armageddon]

I'm like a triple threat
Double dare you to try to rip it next
The way I grip a Tech I'll lick you wet from dick to neck
I know you ain't forget the way these Squad niggas rap
Comin' at me from the sidelines
Like you a tender step [X2]

[Verse 2: Big Punisher]

Fuck the battle in this World War 4
Hand me the Red Phone
I'll leave the crowd Les Mis√©rables
Up in The Dead Zone
New world order
I only flow with the real horrorcore
C-4 to your door, Pearl Harbor
We can bring it back
Pack the explosives and mini Macs
Gats in the holsters
Strapped to the shoulders of maniacs
Where we at: the projects
Where's your gat: the closet
Aw Shit! Clidda-Clack
Should'a brung that ya' bastard
Buyaka! Got bullets big enough to move ya' car
Land Cruisers, 18-Wheelers, we do it all
Let it happen, I prefer violence instead of rappin'
Fuckin' with this Latin assassin
Better get your head examined
My shit be slammin' like Onyx in Wrestle-Mania
You really want it? You Philly Blunted in Pennsylvania
I'm aiming the Mac right at your hat
Better watch your back, black
I ain't sayin' you wack, but you's a copycat

[Hook: Armageddon]

I'm like a triple threat
Double dare you to try to rip it next
The way I grip a Tech I'll lick you wet from dick to neck
I know you ain't forget the way these Squad niggas rap
Comin' at me from the sidelines
Like you a tender step [X2]

[Verse 3: Cuban Link]

Yo, now who the fuck dare to battle this
You garbage pail rappers gon' get your cabbage split
Gotta have it, I'm branding amateur niggas like cattle hips
Watch your lips, cause what you're fucking with is hazardous
Shut up and catch your clip, I roll with more dogs than St. Lazarus
What happened is your rap's innacurate
You claim you're packin' it
But when the action hits you'd rather switch into a faggot-bitch
I'm hardcore, slap my 4, you're softer than cardboard
You started to battle now I'mma turn into the God form
Switch your South Pole like De La Hoya Golden Boy
I'll put it on your Polaroid finish, left you as red as Sonja
I've been a soldier all my life, fought for stripes
Almost saw the light, talked to Christ
He told me that my soul's on ice
So for the right price I might just body you
Chop your ass into particles and read about you in newspaper articles
Sick and tired of you talkin' shit, got beef with me then so be it
I'll rush you like the Soviet Union and leave you soaking wet

[Hook: Armageddon]

I'm like a triple threat
Double dare you to try to rip it next
The way I grip a Tech I'll lick you wet from dick to neck
I know you ain't forget the way these Squad niggas rap
Comin' at me from the sidelines
Like you a tender step [X4]
