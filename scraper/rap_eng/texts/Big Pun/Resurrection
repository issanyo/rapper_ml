[Intro]

I'd rather be a dead man
And go out of this world as a man
That stood for something
Than to bow down like a dog

[Verse 1: Big Punisher]

I know you heard the stories
Pun's a killer
On a search for glory
The Heavens cursing on me
That's why I'm stuck in purgatory
Niggas bore me with rough raps
My shit is truly for the cats that bust gats
Where's the noise, where my thugs at?
Where my dogs at?
Where my love at?
Where my squad at?
Where my motherfucking nigga Joe the God at?
Ready for combat, being long-strapped, long gat
Now disarm that, physically, making contact
We the wrong cats, you don't bark at
Better spark that, walk that, lock that
Trigger pump, cock back, park that, pop that
Right where the heart at
Take the Glock, like make sure I don't pop that
You don't want that
That's the final chapter
Feel you spinal rapture when I rip through your vinyl
Like a rhymin' raptor
I'm the Cappa like Don
I'm not a rapper I'm on
A fortified killer from the back of the Bronx, What!

[Interlude: Big Punisher]

First album
I let everybody know who the nicest, you know what I'm sayin'
Now we take it to the next level, the whole world know who the nicest, know what I'm sayin'
Now you know, we finally get our due, you know what I mean?

[Verse 2: Big Punisher]

Fuck all y'all non-believers
I roll with God, the squad n' TS
Out with the BS, we platinum, they even doubted Jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brain-bolic with knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down
Walkin' around with gold by the pound
Frozen and drowned with diamond boulders, all in the crown
Talk of the town
Soakin' you down with toasts 'til you drown
Ghost you and grind your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin'-
And I get furious quick
And I'll take you for a walk through the ghetto
You either spark your metal
Or get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep' the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a Mac in the back of the Ac'
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that, but don't think I won't counter-act
My niggas is strapped
And quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the Mac, quicker than Kung-Fu
With the reflexes of a cat, and the speed of a mongoose
Stupid!
