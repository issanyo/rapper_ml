[INTRO]

Voice: DJ do it all!

[Canibus]

Hold up
Set in the salt for my nigga Agent
Killa Sha on the front line
Two five shine style

[Pre-Hook: Canibus with backup vocals from others]

Nobody move
Nobody get laced
Fuckin' with Canibus Big Pun and Khadafi
Nobody move
Nobody get laced
Fuckin with Killa Sha Big Pun and Khadafi
What!

[Verse 1: Big Pun]

Brace yourself before you get yourself laced
Fucking with the spic piece of shit Scarface
Tony Mon, rolling with Joey the only don
Cartagena, cock the nina, its on
Enter my world of doom, consume fear and feel the panic
I ram a lightning bolt between the earth and the moon and curl the planets
I'm [?] wit lyrics spannin' for galaxies
Battle me, mathematically, I'm givin' your wisdom a cavity
Rapidly flowing, controlling the time
Step over the line, I'm blowing your mind wit just a flow and a rhyme
I'm Hogan in his prime, too strong and fast
You can bomb and blast, c'mon, you'll still be on your ass
I'm satisfaction guaranteed
You're fiction like Quentin Tarantin'
Kickin' your baddest dreams, shit you haven't seen
I have to be perfectly honest
We should have an anniversary to acknowledge
The way I work the Ebonics
I verbally vomit on all these niggas that try to get us
With garbage lyrics, my style delivers outside the Outer Limits
I'm like the pyramids whose every point is precise
Now you know me for life, four hundred pound, Cuban flooded wit ice


[Hook x2: Canibus and Tragedy Khadafi]

Brace yourself before you get yourself laced
Fucking with the sick Arabic Scarface
We represent a cold race, thugs full of hate
Enemies of the state locked behind gates

[Verse 2: Canibus]

Yo, yo, yo
First nigga to move, get laced like shoes
Its an example, so the second nigga knows what i do
Where I'm from, we don't give a fuck about rules we grimy
{​​"You think I'd kill two kids and a woman?"}​​
....aight motherfucker try me
I'm one of the worst Scarfaces reincarnated
That carving your name in the pavement shit is outdated
I go to Mount Rushmore with high powered lasers
Replace all 4 of them faces with 4 facelifts
One at a time, until they all look like mine
A new and improved design for the 1 triple 9
A better nigga with better lyrics and better rhymes
Ahead of my time I'll even put my life on the line
While you in the studio writing your rhyme
I'll run up in it with a hydrogen bomb singing the sacred psalm
[Chant]
And then I'll blow us all to hell in the name of Allah

[Hook x2)]

[Verse 3: Tragedy Khadafi]

Yo
You ain't a thug, screaming at the sight of your own blood
I'll run up in the spot and take everything you love
Masked and gloved it, the way we dubbed it you loved it
Lost like an innocent child soon as the slug hit
Thug shit, wild like Geronimo Pratt
I'll disarm you and stand right in front of your gat
Yeah for real though niggas can't fuck with my piece see
It's real though you can get clapped back to BC
We burn cali in QB, hashy, team be
Steady extremely
Islamic, atomic, rip mics like Prophet Mohammed
More or less, my war techs tear your chest
Hot slugs have you dripping from chest to Gortex
You small minded, you can't fuck with my degrees
You leukemia heads, smoked too many trees
Brace yourself before you get yourself laced
Fucking with the sick Arabic Scarface
I' a sheik, still creep, wrapped in turban
Laptops in the headrest, black suburban

[Hook x2]
