[Verse: Big Pun]
Don't try to play me cause I'm not a player
Ayo I shot the place up and pass the heat off like a hot potata
I'm bout to make a million dollies, but still I'm rowdy
So I [?] before I have to kill somebody
That's how it is in the stone jungle
If you known to own a bundle, guaranteed nigga gonna mug you
And no one love you when you broke and shit, focus kid
Commercials don't lie, thirsty to die
[?]
(sniffles twice)
Blow ya life away, that's a big price to pay
(crew laughing and clapping)
They're here to teach this kid how to ride his bike
Are they stupid?
