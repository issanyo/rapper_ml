Chorus: Reign and Yankee B    (2x's)

[Big Punisher]
Yo, yo, Ayo I had enough
Why niggas bluff like they rag'em off
Bad enough rappers act like they can't get snuff
I had it up to here players a dressing like musketeers

Another year motherfuckers a be rapping in underwears
I wonder were the hardcore went
Y'all gone sent shit that have me up drunk all bent
Now is all pimp but I ain't felling the same feeling the same
Next time I rhyme I' am gone' start reviling some names
Pulling cards doing job for dough
Like back in '84 before I ran the squad with Joe (Terror Squad)
Wasn't long ago I was on the low bound to blow
Some perfection a getting down with the don of flow
Long as you know Bronx two four first the skakey
Golden label New York like my man Yankee
Niggas should thank me for becoming a superstar
Cus if I wasn't I'll be robbing that ass no matter who you are

Chorus: Reign and Big Punisher    (2x's)
[R] So who you are

[Reign]
All my ladies in the place go down
All my players in the place go down
And now we bringing it from town to town
You know I get down so down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
You know we get down
Get down diggy down diggy down down

[Yankee B]
Gridlock, QB's representer
With the Brooklyn for clementa
In your center spark leafs in the winters
Stalking a in the central (damn you a playa)
Niggly no I 'am a crusher
Titles a new relationships like Usher
Let me touch yah let me crush yah
Let me find a way to move your body sucka
Yo the west coast booty caller
Flexing like a sexy Latalia
Susiana, back in Louisiana
Trick for o-b but now I can't stand her (but why though)
Yo she try to be a commander
All in the face want the key for the Rangler, for the Rangler
For the Rangler Yankee B QB coming at you

Chorus: Reign & Yankee B
