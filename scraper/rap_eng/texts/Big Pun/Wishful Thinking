[Fat Joe] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[Kool G Rap] Once you rule the world every girl will want to be with you
[Big Pun] First I get the money then I get the power
[B-Real] B-Real love to kill eliminate the guitars

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Thinkin' of takin' a plane
To take a flight out to the red light
And smuggle 10 pounds of weed
Make it home tonight
Be the number 1 smuggler in the area
Got enough weight to fill up an air craft carrier
Erb slanger, Hasila Incorporated
State to state and over seas gettin' faded
Buddha king had seen the green proton
I'm bringing it on right back home to Don
Many different strains of erb in my brain
I'm slippin' through customs in my hydro plane
Skunk and the one chocolate ty bud
Niggas lets get high in the sky hit the blunts
And the bongs, fill up the lungs, niggas don't stop
Fools get sprung when they get there smoked up for crops
I give props, for all the soldiers in the war
Yo what would you do if the world was yours

[Hook]
[Kool G Rap] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[Big Pun] Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
[B-Real] First I get the money then I get the power
[Fat Joe] Joey crack twist the caps enemies I devour

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
It was only a dream 16 battin' Beamers and Benz's
Lying penants with diamonds ill as lacin' in a face with avengances
Having blocks on in the lava parts dome
My mankind with crime is how you shine if you can't rhyme
Dime droppers will give your fad time if you sleep
But my mistake will be mastering heat on city streets
And in the east I be known as Don Cartegena
Claimin' the throne like Calderon in this heron arena
Lacin' the china wit Menida
This felony repeater'll be a leader
Like a preacher but so much deeper
Peep the shit that I be on, sippin' Don
Until I'm drunk with a million in my trunk like Nicky Barnes
Come on, I be the top extortionist
Adopt a dozen foster kids right out the motherfucking' orphanage
Yea, I do it for the youth, I'm livin' proof
All my peeps on the streets know I speak the truth

[Hook]
[Big Pun] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[B-Real] Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
[Fat Joe] First you get the money then you get the power
[Kool G Rap] G Rap bustin' the gats slangin' last by every hour

[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
No doubt
I be the crime story of all ghetto territories
Soldiers at war be blowin' up niggas like Glory
With pharmaceutical lavatories
Majored in chemistry, PHD in streetology
Degree in drug industry
Combinin' H²O with matter from crack batter
Residue molecules scatter
Launchin' rockets to make the pocket fatter
Mind brighter than Einsteins for crime
G equals and MC that ain't near the square son I gets mine
But yo the kill the fill with force fields and shields
And holy steel, a nigga keep it real
You know the deal, if the stakes ain't too high for me to grab it
I got to have, stack all the cabbage
From conducting a drug traffic
Police'll jam me in tryna find a new plot to frame me in
Or ring me in so I resort the evil thoughts like Damien
Display my fury to the D-A and the jury
100 grand the judges hammer slams I'm a free man

[Hook]
[B-Real] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[Fat Joe] Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
[Kool G Rap] First you get the money then you get the power
[Big Pun] Big Pun's the same son bustin' my guns for the Dollars

[Verse 4: Big Pun]
Yo, I walk on water
Spit fire and shit Häagen-Dazs
Idolize no man like Conan and stand beside the gods
Be larger than life, twice as nice as your idol
Pump you with pride, then guide you straight to hell like the Bible
I'm liable to start manipulatin' minds infiltrate and climb
Out the pitfalls of life, entice with nickle plated nine
It seems every time I dream I'm in a nightmare
I fiend to live in a world where mothers and queens of men would fight fair
[Fat Joe:] Hell Yea!
I wish I could, I wish I could
Never forget this whole damn world ain't shit, not just the hood
Yo, I'd change my life make my wife forget the tears from the pain and physical abuse
Give her back her best years
Grab my chest hairs, pound my fist on the hard cement
Spark the scent, and cloud the sky to my heart's content
Repent if thou shall be forgiven
How could we be proud to live in a world
Which condemns man, child, and woman?
