Yeah.. 6430.. Ty Fyffe where you at?
Aww shit.. smooth it out
Where my chick tonight? Thug style
Knock em out Pun!

I pull your motherfuckin plug like a thug's supposed ta
Hold a loaded toast, who want the pistol smoke
Cause I'll initial on my shoulder holster
You know the culture when it's East coast, we run the streets most
Who want beef? Turn your peeps into meatloaf
You know the steez, when it's murder in third degrees
We reserve the breeze, and move with the wind like birds and bees
Word to G's, Christ I'm nice, g'head roll the dice
You know the price, your kid and your crib, like I'm +Poltergeist+
I'm cold as ice, control your life with the mic
And then take your crown, break you down like liquid nitrogen
Invite your men, I strike your chin while you rappin
If you're on some thug shit, fill my clip and start clappin
Make your heart flatten, stop actin retarded
All you flea hearted villains, build your rhythm over restart it
The streets are God and heavenly, where the vinyls doubles
Forty-fives and shovels ready in the five livest boroughs

[6430] Who is a thug? Are you for sure?
[Pun] Big Pun baby, I'm a thug for life
I'm a thug for life, I'm a thug for life
[6430] Who is a thug? Are you for sure?
[Pun] Aiyyo my word is bond, long as I'm alive I'mma put it on
Coulda gone legit shit, thug nigga til I'm gone

Yo, I'm a thug to the heart, bugged from the start ever since a child
I've been livin wild, chillin with illest crowds
Splittin thous' on my connect in the street
Twenty-percent protection, expected at the end of the week
Never we sleep, a thug doesn't rest
Cause a wise man said, it was a cousin of death
If it wasn't the stress, it was one to your chest
There's many ways to die, in the slums when you stressed
But not me, Big P, cause I'm the son of the devil
Run up in your cribbo and suffocate your son with a pillow
You know I'm comin to kill you when you hear the heavy breathin
Give you a wedgie deep in your deep end with a butcher machete greetin
Thinkin of Madison Square, I'll battle you there
Carry you clear 'cross the planet just to challenge you here
Embarass you where it hurts, and sandwich you in a hearse
God sent you with a curse, that's why your parachute didn't work
Dead in the dirt (yup) with the bugs and the mice
That's the price, frontin like a thug for life

[6430] Who is a thug? Are you for sure?
[Pun] Big Pun baby, I'm a thug for life

Coulda gone legit shit, thug nigga til I'm gone

My nigga Funk Flex -- you a thug like me
My man Sunkiss -- you a thug like me
Crazy Roland -- you a thug like me
My niggas RMS -- y'all thugs like me
My girl Big Lils -- you a thug like me

Yo, me and my man are plannin to handle these two broads
Thought he was Rambo a vandal his brand a Lambor' Countache
With ammo that scrambled his brains and luxury ducats
Harder with somethin hard to sharpen
In the driver's box of the glove compartment
Rotten lowdown dirty sheisty kind of conniver
Ex nine-to-fiver, ready to die as long as I'm the driver
Supplyin buyers of flyers in bundles stacked dope
Humble prices on ices twice as nice as crumbled crack coke
I hope it lasts long, word bond, I bring my brothers with me
Definitely, and start off my own thug committee
