[Intro]

You know, it seems to me that everyone is concerned with way it is
And they say that everyone cheats
Well here's a question
If you cheat, don't you think that she will?

[Chorus 1 - Tony Sunshine]
Cheat on her
Or she's gonna cheat on you
But she does it classy
At a hot little spot
At some rendez-vous (rendez-vous)
Cheat on her
Even though she's gonna cheat on you
'Cos she does it nasty with your best friend
And your brother too

[Verse 1 - Cuban Link]
Yo, ay yo, excuses excuses
I'm sick of this bullshit it's useless
You're ruthless, you accused of me cheating
But where's your proof miss?
The truth is, you be flipping too much with those loose lips
Is it because I got the chicks feeling my music?
If the shoe fits, wear it
Yo you be thinkin' I'm stupid
Acting like you don't do shit, I studied ya movements
And you've been too slick since they first introduced us
Your used to being up in clubs dancing to lewd shit
You should think before you speak
Trying to blame it all on me
Eager to beef so you can leave and have a cheap excuse to cheat
See I know the game baby, you've been acting strange lately
A little deranged, you changed, you ain't the same lady
Playing me shady, claiming that I'm running trains daily
Saying you hate me maybe it's the fame that's making you crazy
Maybe it's me and just the way that I see it
Better believe it, if I never got caught I never cheated
Keep it real even the sweetest girls be cheating at will
Then you see 'em chillin' like if they don't be feelin' no guilt
Willin' to deal with it, givin' you that devious grill
'Cos she feels you did it so she's getting even to heal
I know the deal

[Chorus 2]
Cheat on her
Or she's gonna cheat on you
Cos she does it classy
At her friends [?] house, comment allez-vous
Cheat on her
Though shes gonna cheat on you
'Cos she does it nasty
Wiht the whole Terror Squad foundation crew

[Verse 2 - Big Pun]
Thought I was living low key
Official pimp daddy O.G
My whole steez was drinking beer and adultery
But don't sleep, a freak ain't always a mack
Then I found out my lil' sweet was blowin' out backs
She was lonely in track, started sipping Bacardi
Met some pimp at a party, now she stripping at Ardy's
Copped a whip and a Harley
Mad kick in the body, finally slipped at a hottie
With the politic of Anagi
Probably ran more trains than the third rail
Fuck it, it's her world, mind you this used to be a church girl
So it's my worst fear, jus knowing I'm responsible
When I sleep all I see is Mandingo throwing and King-Kongin' you
Can't rest, its like I'm hexed for life
How much respect you expect when niggas is sexing your wife
Professional advice, ignore the whores and the hooters
'Cos pains of the heart hurt much more than the bruises
More than a loser, 'cos I lost love in the fast lane
Next time I'll think twice before I give away my last name
Its mad strain, mad strife, mad stress but its a man's game
And your wife 'll be next

[Tony Sunshine]
I'm sorry (Baby I'm sorry)
Is all that I can say
I cheated, I didn't mean it
Baby I'm sorry

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
