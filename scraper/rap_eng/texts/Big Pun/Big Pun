[Hook: G Fella]
BIG PUN
Had to do this track with your big son
Let this new generation know how big you really was
BIG PUN
Thanks for all the blood sweat and tears pun
Rest in peace save me a 16 when my day comes

[Verse 1: G Fella]
Anything you do from dollars to cents
You gonna be kicking back not for self defence
Matter fact you can look at me as your permenate peal
But he'd give ya bigger punishment then Chris Rios
You had to pardon the puns
No pressure if i have to put you under the gun god bless ya
Terrorizing squads ass
Im a star in the red white and blue like the puertorican flag
Dead in the middle of little Italy
Green, white, red, nonthin' to do with cars but my 16 hybird
Always gonna be chubby the situation solve em
No patience i guess i got a wait problem
G fella coming for the thrown
Im BX bone, right here in hip-hops home
Tom curse and cat dudes with doms due
And we run up on animals in the bronx you remember

[Verse 2: Chris Rivers (AKA Baby Pun)]
Tiriny impossible, logically improbable
Yet constantly I'm topping dudes
About to be unstoppable, probably I'm god to you
Lightning streaks an obstacle
But see my speech and follows you
I seem to reap the powerful
Limitless and intricate, intimate with infinite
Enter this, my inner wish, i find my bliss by killin' this
Lyricist to murderer, I spit the flame and burn the words
That's how I remain with bars and verbs
Cause I put pain in every verse
Tactical retractable, fade away, come back at you
Radical intangibles, can't touch me like I'm magical
Say in a way I'm flammable, ignite the world surrounding you
And in the midst of all the ash you see that I've astounded you
Challenge me? absurdity, you're only worth the words you speak
I'm on the verge of golden beats
While y'all worth less than dirt to me
Verbally, I hurt the beat, I make it want to murder me
Personally, it hurts to be exposed to all this worsening
What i spit is poetry, I'm droolin' with this potency
And no amount of torturing can satisfy this hole in me
This mission is a part of me, to make a fool of prodigies
And all who're stuck on pondering I'll shatter you like pottery


[Verse 3:Big Pun]
I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team
Your squadron'll be barred from rap like Adam and Eve from the garden
I'm carving my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed, you see the BP shine off the boardhead
Reverse that, I curse at the first
Wack nigga with the worst rap
Cause he ain't worth jack, hit em with
A thousand pounds of pressure per slap, make his whole body jerk back
Watch the earth crack, hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggas be swearin I'm blacker than coal
Like Nat King I be rapping and tounges packing
The ones, magnums, cannons and Gatling guns
It's Big Pun, the one and only son of Tony Montana
You ain't promised ma√±ana in the rotten manzana
C'mon pana, we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana snake bite anaconda
