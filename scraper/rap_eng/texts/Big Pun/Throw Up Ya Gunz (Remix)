[Intro]
I have this new project coming out along with some other brothers called "One Nation"
It's like an East Coast/West Coast collaboration
To kill this whole new vibe everybody want to be on about it
Like a war between the East Coast and the West Coast
The East Coast West Coast thing is something that
The journalists and People are making up just to get paid and so it can drag out MTV music awards

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell-bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained and, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sittin' in the cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus
Balling as a youngster, Wondering if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
Got my, hands on my semi-shotty, everybody's bitchin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin' warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight

[Hook x2]
All my niggas on the East Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the West Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the East Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the West Side
Throw your guns up

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G]
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert E's make MC's freeze
You wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apologizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
Realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
Our beef is my fiance, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Niggas ain't shit in the 90's, I don't trust 'em
And bitches on my dick but they ain't shit, so motherfuck 'em
Eazy know's what's up cause see he really don't give a fuck
Cause it don't concern me if don't pertain to money or a nut
But then again I talk to a few of my friends
Nine times out of ten 'bout some ends or some skins
Cause I'm the type of nigga that gotta have it like a rabbit
Rappin' is my hustle bustin' ho's is a habbit
I stab it like a true no good nigga should
I do it the way a down O.G. nigga would
And now Niggas know Eric Wright ain't no busta
Another platinum cut from the Compton thugsta
My name is

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Big Punisher]
The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me 'til I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
And rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggas talk but they babble cause they ain't sayin nuttin
If ain't blazin somethin with the mac I'm in the shack bakin muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin; my Squad been waitin
For the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin
An orgi-nation of veterans built
With genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills
Invest in the real, don't get left in the hills
My tech and my steel turn your whole crew into vega-ta-bills
We blessed with the will to never surrender
Cause my every agenda's in and out, unseen like I entered the ninja
It's my world

[Outro x2]
All my niggas on the East Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the West Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the East Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the West Side
Throw your guns up
