[Intro]
Yo, Big Shaq, the one and only
Man's not hot, never hot
Skrrat (GottiOnEm), skidi-kat-kat
Boom

[Verse 1]
Two plus two is four
Minus one that’s three, quick maths
Everyday man's on the block
Smoke trees (ah)
See your girl in the park
That girl is a uckers
When the ting went quack-quack-quack
You man were ducking
Hold tight, Asznee
He's got the pumpy
Hold tight, my man
He’s got the frisbee
I trap, trap, trap on the phone
Movin' that cornflakes
Rice Krispies
Hold tight, my girl Whitney

[Refrain]
The ting goes skrrrahh (ah)
Pap, pap, ka-ka-ka (ka)
Skidiki-pap-pap (pap)
And a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom (boom)
Skya (ah)
Du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun (dun)
Poom, poom
The ting goes

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
On, on, on, on, on the road doin' ten toes
Like my toes (like my toes)
You man thought I froze
I see a peng girl, then I pose (chilin')
If she ain't on it, I ghost
Hah, look at your nose (check your nose, fam)
You donut
Nose long like garden hose

[Verse 3]
Hop out the four-door with the .44
It was one, two, three and four (us, man)
Chillin' in the corridor (yo)
Your dad is forty-four (uh)
And he's still callin' man for a draw (look at him)
Let him know
When I see him
I’m gonna spin his jaw (finished)
Take man’s Twix by force (take it)
Send man's shop by force (send him)
Your girl knows I’ve got the sauce (flexin')
No ketchup (none)
Just sauce (saucy)
Raw sauce
Ah, yo, boom, ah

[Refrain]
The ting goes skrrrahh (ah)
Pap, pap, ka-ka-ka (ka)
Skidiki-pap-pap (pap)
And a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom (boom)
Skya (ah)
Du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun (dun)
Poom, poom
The ting goes

[Drop]

[Outro]
Big Shaq
I tell her man's not hot (man's not)
I tell her man’s not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
