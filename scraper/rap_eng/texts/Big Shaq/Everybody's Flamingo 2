[Intro: Kero Kero Bonito: Flamingo]
How many shrimps do you have to eat
Before you make your skin turn pink?
Eat too much and you'll get sick
Shrimps are pretty rich

[Verse 1: Panic! At the Disco: I Write Sins Not Tragedies]
Oh, well imagine, as I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
What a beautiful wedding!
"What a beautiful wedding" says a bridesmaid to a waiter
Oh, yes, but what a shame
What a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore

[Verse 2: Chris Brown: Look At Me Now]
Let's go!
'Cause I feel like I'm running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday day, day, go!
See they don't really wanna pop me (Blow!)
Just know that you never flop me (Oh!)
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow and then I gotta shudder any little thing that nigga think he be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna dadadada
Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing
I gotta do a lot of things, to make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and again

[Verse 4 Overlap]
[Verse 3: Kero Kero Bonito: Flamingo]
Black, white, green, or blue
Show off your natural hue
Flamingo-oh-oh-oh woah
If you're multicolored that's cool too
You don't need to change
It's boring being the same
Flamingo-oh-oh-oh woah
You're pretty either way

[Verse 4: Perfect Breakfast: Reese's Puffs]
Reese's Puffs, Reese's Puffs
Reese's Puffs, Reese's Puffs
(Wow) I got Reese's Puffs in my bowl
(Wow) Nowadays on cruise control
(Wow) I got Reese's Puffs in my bowl
(Wow) And just like that I'm on a roll

[Verse 5: Smash Mouth: All Star]
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was lookin' kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an L on her forehead
Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the backstreets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Verse 6: Earth, Wind, & Fire: September]
Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changing the mind of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away

[Verse 7: Vitas: 7th Element]
Aha, aha, hahaha, hahaha-ha
Brlrl, brlrl, haha
Aha, aha, hahaha, hahaha-ha
Brlrl, brlrl, haha
Aha, aha, hahaha, hahaha-ha
Brlrl, brlrl, haha
Aha, aha, hahaha, hahaha-ha
Brlrl, brlrl, haha

[Verse 8: Childish Gambino: Redbone]
Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
You made a nigga wait for some, so long

[Verse 9: Big Shaq: Mans Not Hot]
Two plus two is four
Minus one that's three, quick maths
Everyday man's on the block, smoke trees
See your girl in the park
That girl is a uckers
When the ting went quack-quack-quack
You man were ducking
Hold tight, Asnee
He's got the pumpy
Hold tight, my man
He's got the frisbee
I trap, trap, trap on the phone
Movin' that cornflakes
Rice Krispies
Hold tight my girl, Whitney (Perfect)

[Verse 10: Foster the People: Pumped up Kicks]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
Better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
Better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
Better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
Better run, better run, faster than my bullet
