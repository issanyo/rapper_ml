[Intro: Konstantin]
Hmm, first of all Jallow
What is this effects you're using
That's a dead filter
You've killed that shot, alright
Keep a bit of yellow in it, make it a bit more blue
Mate I don't think you know what you're doing when it comes to this editing thing
Aight, little Jallow video sucks come at me bro
Anyway, hahaha

[Interlude: Jallow & Big Shaq]
Yo

Yo fam, imagine yeah this sipping
Hey load that, load that please
It's an important phone call
Yo imagine yeah

In a bit

[Pre-Verse]
Konstantin
You wanna react to my video and chat shit yeah?
SUKA

Trooh Hippi

[Verse 1]
So a man called Kon wanna call out my name (why)
He's about to see the fallout of shame
Manna come through like a hawk when I aim
Send straight shots  and swarmed by the fame
You're watching my visuals and taking the piss
So I'll take out my mac and extended the clips
Everyone knows I'm king with the vids
Name me someone who shoots their own diss
Yo Kon, whats wrong
You've seemed upset for long
Is your cam not turning on?
Or has JJ ran out of songs (its peak)
He's got you on strings like a puppet
Your music vids your fans love it
But you both know they'd be shit
If you didn't have JJ's budget (so shit)
I make banger vids with my hand and a cam
And that's just because I'm a man with a plan
Whereas you need the whole sidemen gang
And a whole crew in the back of a van
Big budgets, no I don't need it
You like my vids but afraid to tweet it
When I was told this I couldn't belive it
You saw gigabytes and thought you could eat it
You can run channels but you can't run laps
Make boring vids and that's just facts
People only watch your boring videos
Hoping to see Simon in the back (free views)
Last year I kicked herb out the door
This year Imma dash Kon on the floor
JJ's put enough food on your plate
So why the hell are you asking for more (why)
Calling me out for no reason
Just to get involved in diss track season
You get bare gassed when fans take pics
They only take them 'cause they thought you were Ethan
I climb to the top like a ladder (I climb)
So the words you say don't matter
I film Micheal Dapaah (Big Shaq)
You film wannabe rappers (they're whack)
Vids look cheap as a flip flop
Spend your life in a chip shop
Sidemen gets you all of your views
But your clout lasts as long as a Tik Tok
Clearly jealous and wanna be me
Because most of the time im not in the country
Sidemen Sunday that's one shoot a week
So you're clearly a pyscho that wants my p (it's silent)
That's why you hate all the time
Stressed out, money on your mind
Somebody told me you're so broke
Even your SD card declined
Sending for Jallow, straight nono
How can you cuss me with shit photos
I think it's time to now own up
For taking the bite out of the mac logo
