Part 1: Prod. by x

[Intro]
Hold tight Max Branning, my brudda
Love to all my G's
Aight, boom

[Verse]
I counted like 3, 2, 1
Santa, are you dumb?
You just cussed my mum
Your jaw will get spun
Rudolph left he run
Trust, he didn't want none
The reindeer had a gun
Somethings gonna get bun
Bunsen burner, yeah we light it
Pork on the table, I don't bite it
Is that bacon? Give it to Jason
He's jafakin
Fam he's Asian
Talkin' 'bout bumba, bumba, bumba, click
This brudda, what a neek
Yo Shafique, pass the turkey
He said I can't, he's doing Burpees
Who's in the room? Let me see
Is that Asznee, kissing Dafnee, who has acne
On her forehead
All this happening, on a moped
I turn left, I see Santa holding a panda
Drinking Fanta, from Uganda
You think it's banter?

Part 2: Prod. by Gotcha

[Intro]
Ayy, lemme switch dis
You dun know
Ayy Young Potassium, I see you
Carbon Monoxide, you dun know the ting

[Verse]
One, two, three four five
Once I caught a fish alive
Six, seven, eight nine ten
Then I let it go again
And again and again, then that fish went pen
I saw Kesha, I saw Ken
He was holding a skeng under his skirt
He called it kilt
Big man I don't kill
Holding my drink
It got spilt
That was coconut milk
Man I go ching-ching-ching for the ching Ford
See your ex in Bedford
Hold tight man like Pickford
Duck man down in dat Ford (Ford-Ford-Ford)
I went Barking, couldn't find parking
Kinda jarring
Had the .44, long like biscuit
'four bed, I drink Nesquik
Yo, yo
Man's black, my hair is black
Tracksuit black, your girl is Zack
She's got a back, your sisters clapped
What is that?
Round of applause, clap-clap-clap
Flex with a stack? It ain't yours
Big man, put your lies on pause
Stay in your lane, sit with Jane
Man got Twitter, troll insane
Bring the tissue, I need Andrex
High school prom
Your mum wore spandex
Where's my ex? I don't call her
Where's my next? I don't know her
Uhh-uhh
It's Christmas time, I wanna celebrate
Christmas time, I don't wanna be late
Christmas time, I don't wanna be rude
Christmas time, ayy where's the food?
It's in, ching-ching-ching for the ching Ford
Duck man down in a big Ford
Fly your girl like Concorde
143 on the dashboard (Board)

[Outro]
You dun know
Big Shaq
