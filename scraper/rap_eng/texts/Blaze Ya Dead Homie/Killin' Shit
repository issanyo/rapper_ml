[Full Clip aka 2 dope]

F U L L C L I P, Full Clip murderin' shit on our fourth LP
Keepin' it killa thuggin' straight up OG
Diggin' your beef and runnin' your shit, its our money
Your loss is my gain, so check this right here
Even if you didn't lose it, I'm still takin it (Hell Yeah!)
My hollow tips in your chest make for a murder scene
No remorse, no conscience in this killin' machine

[Foe Foe aka Monoxide]

I'm on some killin' shit, I kill a bitch quick
Cut it with bisquick, and serve it to 'em thick on the strip
Hit 'em hard like my truck when I'm beatin' the whip
You wanna start, I got a pump that'll end this shit
Bandanas on my face, saw the witnesses
Ain't seen a fuckin' thang when I clip this kid
I'm killin' everythang from bitches to CDs
I'm a bad dream waitin' to happen to police

[Chorus]

We on some killin' shit
We into killin' shit
Ain't no use in duckin' everybody gettin' hit
Shotgun
Killin' shit
Pop one
Killin' shit
Everybody
Run when the gauge spin

[Lil shank aka Madrox]

I'm on some killin' shit, mashin' with a pistol grip
Murder in my eyes, with the temper of a lunatic
Don't matter how I try, they bout to die
When I'm doin this, push the fufckin' trigger
As I'm runnin' 'em for all they shit
And all they whips and all they chips
Run it all, I need that bro
Pockets inside out, Debo'n them hoes
Call it 187 when the target is locked
Mister Duk Da fuk Down before your ass get shot

[Cell Block aka Blaze]

I smoke more blunts than a little bit
Steady on some killin' shit
Everydays the same, floatin' in the whip
Don't surround to flip the switch ridin' three wheel
With a hand up out the window and its wrapped around the steel
Let slugs fly out at will, give a fuck how you feel
A Rydas on the block, and he's huntin' for the kill
Line the suckas up on the center of the dash
Ain't no way they gettin' away cuz I'm mashin' on the gas

[Chorus]

[YungDirt aka Boondox]

Yung Dirt:
Oh no it's the motherfukin' kick door
Blast off the masterlock, now everybody hit the floor
They kill 'em all, its like I'm caught up in a genecide
Ammunition cease, seekers ain't no fukin' where to hide
So line 'em up and set 'em up for the execution
Nine millimeter loaded and its set on distribution
With no confusion, they can make it all clear
Everybody fuckin' dyin' before I step the fuck up outta here

[Bullet aka Violent J]

Keep your eyes on my death tool, your goin' dizzy
Who is he, the one that keep the colinders busy
You see the fuck flash and a duck fast, your a fucked ass
Single barrel pump wavin' out the black truck blast
I'm on some killin' shit, so real I'm dealin' this shit
I caught a pig and cash and [???] I'm stealin' the hit
Cuz I'm a Ryda, and with this .45 I'll divide ya
Leave you dead and peel off, won't even try to hide ya
