I try to feel the sunshine while standing in the rain
(In the rain)
You try to hold me down with all your restrain
(Your restrain)
I try to feel the sunshine while standing in the rain
(In the rain)
You try to hold me down with all your restrain
(Your restrain)
I try to feel the sunshine while standing in the rain
(In the rain)
You try to hold me down with all your restrain
(Your restrain)

[Verse 1]
I'm the greatest escape artist the hardest situation is getting free
From the terror that keeps confining me
I got to be better than Houdini and David Blaine
With no magician, no illusions, no subliminal
No hypnosis to your brain, I'm untrained
Children should not try this at home at all
I'm a free lance professional
And this is on my own I staged the whole bit
I drink and talk a little shit and see who got the balls to pull a strap
And really use it, that's where the fun comes in
Cause after they pop me they got to hide my body
So no one's suspicious about who shot me
It's interesting to see the means and the tactics and tape
To make sure that my death is tucked away nice and safe

[Verse 2]
Sunshine's for suckers and queers
That's what they told me as they rolled me in the carpet
And threw me over the bridge just like I was some garbage
Of course I was unconscious not dead in the sense they thought I was
But a slug in your dome will get you caught up cause
I'm not invincible I could die a million times
Each time more painful than the first, still I survive
Both hands are tied behind my back as I'm breathing dirty water
And my legs are been mauled to death by the sewer rats
I move erratically to make them work for their meal
I'm dislocating my shoulders I slip out just like banana peel
I'm close to drowning again
Ten minutes and counting me to them
Is my record so I feel it like I'm ahead
In points was the view from the west but it's all good
Best believe that your boy will be back to walk the neighborhood
In no time water logged and bullet ridden
They be like, "I can't believe that he did it, he really escaped?"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No stun, I'm running with some gangstas
Not no bitchass wangstas
But some real gangstas fed my legs into a woodchipper
But the blades got caught on my bones cause I woke up screaming
And noticed that my right foot and... leg was gone
My eye popped out the socket and dangling on the cheek
They must have strangled me to sleep cause I'm unable to speak
I must have screamed just inside of my head
Cause they still think that I'm dead
They using a shovel to scrape away clumps of the red
From out the chipper they pop my legs out
So they can chop me up manually bag me up and throw me out
No sweat, give me a week and a roll of some duct tape
And a shovel to dig the rest of my body up and I'm straight
