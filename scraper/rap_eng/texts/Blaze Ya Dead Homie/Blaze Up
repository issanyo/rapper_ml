[Intro]
Dead!
Psychopathic
Clockwork Gray
Blaze Ya Dead Homie back in this mother fucker
Blaze up, Blaze up

[Verse 1: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Bored of street thugs that bragged we done
To all the people that disappeared now they showing me love
I got something for you homie and I call it a "slug"
One for all you motherfuckers so really you want none
Let it be known that my clock tick's like heart beats
And when you hear it stop it's a done deal like swap meat
I copy from cops on the beef who want to stop me
I don't cop please so walk softly
I'm bring back that I don't give a fuck rap
With a shotgun hanging from a rainbow strap
It's the beginning of a world wide mission
And when I'm finished there's going to be a lot of you missing
And fish swimming

[Hook: Blaze & ROC]
I've been with it since day one
Still carry the same gun
The sea side till I die bitch so Blaze up
I've been with it since day one
Still carry the same gun
And sea side till I die bitch so Blaze up

When they keep talking shit homie Blaze up
When they fuck with your money homie Blaze up
Be sure before the cops come Blaze up
And that's how your dead homie always stays up

I got a gun and I'm holding it down, what
(Blaze Up)
I got a gun and I'm holding it down, what
(Blaze Up)
I got a gun and I'm holding it down, what
(Blaze Up)
I got a gun and I'm holding it down
(Stays Up)

[Verse 2: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
High, Black blood soaked to my lungs like a sponge so I can't even get no love
With no heart beat Word on the streets is I'm back like L-L and destine to free Pete
I promise that I'm a player you known nothing about
Like a pimp with a heavy hand and a real big mouth
Not a sucker with an unloaded piece looking to get shot
My name is still the same and them slugs is still hot
With the blast that I'ma toast you like a boss slice with the crust's cut
So back up raise up before you make me blaze up homie you don't know me like that
And if you move any closer I'ma blow out You back

[Hook]
