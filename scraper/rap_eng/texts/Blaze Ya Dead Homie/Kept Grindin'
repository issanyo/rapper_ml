[Intro: DJ Clay]
Juggalos... come out and play

[Hook: All]
We kept hustlin
We kept grindin
X4

[Verse 1: Violent J] (1991)
The overwhelming workload that it takes
The shakin' off snakes
The pains and the aches
Wrong moves and mistakes
They disrupt, they corrupt and distract you from your mission
And all those who let go and spend their lives wishin and missin
I couldn't listen in school, I felt I had a different callin
But all everybody did was roll their eyes and start yawnin
But this is real life and only you is livin through your eyes
There are dreamers, those who want it
And us, who won't be denied
Its a struggle every day, success is far from fuckin free
Unless you plucked it from a tree, with J and ICP
Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J (Shaggy: "Refuse to Lose!")
Livin' proof do what you got and you can do what you choose

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope] (1991)
Hate to sit back on this track like a little bitch and remininsce
But instead I'll kick a little history all about the hatchet
By this time in the game, most motherfuckers, they done fell apart
In these years we still shinin and we now just gettin our start
Inner City Posse jumped on the scene and we was mad crewed up
In the end when shit got rough and tough, it was just the two of us
When you was in the club gettin ya grind and ya sip on
We was in the parkin lot, hittin up cars, gettin our flyers on
Did my first show when I was sixteen
It's still part of my scheme
J holdin out a drive-thru window at Burger King to support our dreams
It seemed like yesterday, the world wasn't ready for two clown freaks
But we kept grindin
Now who on whose dick, lil Bitch shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Monoxide Child] (1997)
I woke up in the morning with my head on backwords
Went from street livin to an underground master
Went from sellin baggies in alleys
To sellin bangers from here to Cali
And rollin with the Psychopathic family
I started up with Krazees, hooked up with Violent J
The rest is still bein written like a biography
Don't think you know my story, cause there's too much to tell
Just know that I've been underground and I've been doin well
Since the days of makin tapes in the basement
We came a long way, I'd like to see you do the same shit
Monoxide, and I'm Twiztid with a Z
Carnival representin' til I D-I-E

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox] (1997)
We met ICP way back, touring once or twice
They was real cool, Felt like we known 'em all our life
They said You ever wanna sign with them
We was like hell yeah we down the ground with friends
They put us up, this was way before the family era
When we toured for three years with a t-shirt
Gettin mixed response from the bleachers and show-goers
Prepared for rock-throwers and flame-throwers we stayed focused
In '98 we dropped our first LP
Psychopathic presentin' Twiztid Mostasteless, the CD
Go out and get it bitch, shit is cold as ice
So dope that we released it twice
And we still here

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Blaze Ya Dead Homie] (1999)
It started as a guest spot, Parlayed to a real spot
Worked behind the scenes before I really got a shot
In the studio, quick still needin to prove somethin
My skills got me the deal off the CD you know it's dope
But it was on now in '99, the first GOTJ
Ya Dead Homie Blaze and ABK rippin the stage
The first time I ever got to grind in the sunshine
Six minutes shorter the EP's full play time
Still confusin some, give love for One Less G
That's when we moved to the streets and people started hearin me
From Colton Grundy to Clockwork Grey my skills increased
Don't believe me? Pick up my next CD
Last House on Dead Street

[Verse 6: Anybody Killa] (2001)
I keep it grindin like an old set of car brakes
Started off with a duel player and casette tapes
By '95 my life was frustrated so I developed my mentals and let the funk recreate it
And then I hit the stage with my homie Blaze, thuggin for life
City to city tours under the light
Straight outta Detroit grindin Warrior baby
I ain't never gonna stop, my heat's never on safety
This is Psychopathic bitch boy and we so sweet
What you know about the label runnin under the streets?
This be Anybody Killa homie, like me or not
Over a hundred thousand sold bitch with one bout to drop
For real

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Bonez Dubb] (2006)
Mothafuckas don't trip I'm one of the youngest homies on the (Otis: "block")
And keepin it grindin with a (Otis: "dot")
And on my way to the fuckin ( Otis: 'top")
Because we underneath the surface
Be prepared to get real hurt bitch
We came from the gutter and now
I'm fuckin your mother and workin it
I know I'm only 24 up in this ho but check it yo
I was smokin before some of y'all was even startin to grow
Some of y'all don't even know
So many shows by eighteen
And by my twenty-first I was on the national scene, see
Been given an oppurtunity to speak my words and yo
Be keepin it wicked and run with the hatchet
For sho so smoke your roll
My name is Bonez and this be O-T
We murderin fucks til the sun comes up
That's why they call us A.M.B

[Verse 8: Otis] (2006)
Hey homie I hope you listen to my rappin
Cause rappin is all I have it's all that every fuckin mattered
Your heart can get shattered your pockets can get fatter
Just grind like me and mine and you'll shine like my family
In the beginning my mission was to make it to the hatchet
Then I did it and started laughin I grinded and look what happened
My mind is not on this planet, cause y'all thought that we vanished
But God's Hand got my back
And the game still gets me fuckin mad
I start poppin off at the mouth when somethin bothers me
You mothafuckers better give it up for R.O.C
You mothafuckers better give it up for A.M.B
DJ Clay mixtapes, gettin paid and makin haters bleed

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Boondox] (2006)
All the blood and the tears I spent on most of the years
And all the time on the grind I conquered most of my fears
The knowin I would make it and was it worth the sacrifice
Skippin meals and skippin bills I hoped that it was worth the price
Of the love of my kids and would they hate me in the end
For all the time I didn't spend I knew I'd have to make amends
So kept the mike in one hand the other gripped on my Glock
Kept one eye on the prize the other fixed up on the clock
It was a hustle in my heart that let me know I wouldn't fail
Would I end up on the stage or would I end up in a cell
Then one Monday afternoon I got that call from Psychopathic
Put the pistol in the drawer and now I'm runnin with the hatchet
(All: "Woop Woop!")

[Hook]

[Verse 10: DJ Clay] (2007)
I was sixteen young and was never put on
But was put down strong when Rude Boy gave me a call
Sayin that the wicked clowns had a party called Big Ballas
And if I want to come spin and make a couple dollars
St. Andrew's Hall (Yeah!) Remember it all (Yeah!)
When I went into this game who knew I would last this long
Then when '06 came around you can Fuck the Fuck Off
It was me and Shaggy 2 Dope I was on my first tour
And little did I know it was the first of many more
Now I'm pushin out mixtapes for the Juggalos
And the love I get from them keeps me higher than some dro
That's why I'm standin here, arms crossed
Just to let you know how we

[Hook]
