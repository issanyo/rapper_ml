[Shaggy:]
I was skipping down the block when I heard some moaning
It was Dorothy she said she need some loving
Who the fuck was I to say no?
I took her to the crib, popped in that one movie Ghost
And it was on, my clothes got to pealing
It was sexual healing, but with no feeling
I was sticking my dick into thin air
And right when I busted, Dorothy disappeared

[Monoxide:]
When I met her it was January, middle of winter
I was alone up in my attic where nobody could hear her
It was just a cold gust of wind, I felt somebody pass through me
When I opened up my eyes, my only love appeared to me
Long hair, and she was bald in spots
And her skin was just as soft as a parking lot
And it was love at first sight
I'd never seen her again
And to this day I'm in my attic waiting on my girlfriend

[Chorus:]
Baby, I'm dead but I need you
I'm buried right here, and I'll never leave you
(Baby) She's deader then a doornail, looking for love
Doornail Dorothy was the neighborhood ghost
(Baby) She's deader then a doornail, looking for love
Doornail Dorothy was the neighborhood ghost

[Violent J:]
I started blowing her up with s©ance after s©ance
It's my turn, Violent J, to get in them pants
We went for ice cream but we almost got arrested
"Look he's got a dead body and he's over there molesting it"
I had to throw her in the trunk and take her to the crib
Cause mother fuckers always trippin, they need their money shit
We made love, rigor mortis set and my dick got stuck
But we didn't give a fuck
Hold me forever tight Dorothy

[ABK:]
I once met this chick, I believe her name was Dorothy
She had a banging body but her skin was kind of corpsey
I took her on a blind date, except this bitch was dead
I met her through my homie, guess he found her in his basement
I really didn't mind cause at the time I' kind of lonely
Even though she's dead, I only need someone to hold me
Was it a wise choice? Only time will tell
But I had to fuckin leave cause she was deader then a doornail

[Chorus:]
Baby, I'm dead but I need you
I'm buried right here, and I'll never leave you
(Baby) She's deader then a doornail, looking for love
Doornail Dorothy was the neighborhood ghost
(Baby) She's deader then a doornail, looking for love
Doornail Dorothy was the neighborhood ghost

[Madrox:]
She was looking like a ?? but she was a little hotter
Then the average homeless bitch with the holes in the sweatshirt
Showing off a nipple ring scars and all
But the party don't stop until she loses her bra
Panties are next to come, Oh Double F
But her sugar ain't as tight as that hole in her neck
She don't need respect, she just needs some dick
And me and the Lotus steady in and out of that ghastly shit

[Blaze:]
We hooked up at a block party
That's the point where I remember
Sneaking into her house to smoke a couple joints
I smoked my light in there
She was hanging by surprise
With her fuck me boots, giving me the fuck me eyes
I took the ropes off, and bent her right over the washer
I took a little time cause body parts kept falling of her
I banged her fuckin neden until her head fell off
Picked it right back up so I could bust in her mouth

[Chorus:]
Baby, I'm dead but I need you
I'm buried right here, and I'll never leave you
(Baby) She's deader then a doornail, looking for love
Doornail Dorothy was the neighborhood ghost
(Baby) She's deader then a doornail, looking for love
Doornail Dorothy was the neighborhood ghost

Baby, I'm dead but I need you
I'm buried right here, and I'll never leave you
Baby
Baby
