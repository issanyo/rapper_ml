[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
I'm lost in my head and no one can find me
I'm evil supreme, devil get behind me
Cause you're takin' a walk on the dark side of your heart
(Darkness and pain)
But you knew it was cursed, it was fucked up from the start

[Hook]
Singing - woe, woe, woe, woe
I'm losin' control of my head
And I'm feelin' it's time to get crazy in here
(No no no no) don't say you can't feel it
It's time to get crazy, I'm losing my head up in here
(Tell me if you) see it, feel it, believe it
(Just like I do) feel it, see it, believe it

[Bridge: Monoxide x2]
When you stumble, when you try
And you just can't get things right
Turn the music up and let's get fucked up
This is soundtrack to my life

[Hook]
Singing - woe, woe, woe, woe
I'm losin' control of my head
And I'm feelin' it's time to get crazy in here
(No no no no) don't say you can't feel it
It's time to get crazy, I'm losing my head up in here
(Tell me if you) see it, feel it, believe it
(Just like I do) feel it, see it, believe it

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
They tell me that I'm sick and I need medicine
But I won't take it cause I'm lonely
And hoping for all the voices in my head again
I'm want to let 'em in, so let it be known
Set it in stone, the diabolical duo is coming home

[Bridge 2: Monoxide]
No one can tell me any different
If you're alone, keep your distance
I'm a bomb, just listen to me tickin'
Click, click, boom
Sick addiction
No one can tell me any different
If you're alone, keep your distance
I'm a bomb, just listen to me tickin'
Click, click, boom
Sick addiction
No one can tell me any different
If you're alone, keep your distance
I'm a bomb, just listen to me tickin'
Click, click, boom
Sick addiction

[Hook]
Singing - woe, woe, woe, woe
I'm losin' control of my head
And I'm feelin' it's time to get crazy in here
(No no no no) don't say you can't feel it
It's time to get crazy, I'm losing my head up in here
(Tell me if you) see it, feel it, believe it
(Just like I do) feel it, see it, believe it

[Jamie Madrox]
Anger and pain
You can't match my strength

[Bridge 2: Monoxide]
No one can tell me any different
If you're alone, keep your distance
I'm a bomb, just listen to me tickin'
Click, click, boom
Sick addiction

[Outro]
(Woe, woe, woe, woe)
Anger and pain (no, no, no, no)
You can't match my strength (tell me if you)
Anger and pain (just like I do)
You can't match my strength
(Woe, woe, woe, woe)
Can you show me the way? (no, no, no, no)
Cause I'm likely here to stay (tell me if you)
Can you show me the way (just like I do)
Cause I'm likely here to stay
