Whussup son
Thats right, Lil' Poot up in this piece fool!
Lil' Shank and Foe Foe reppin' the Ryda Clique

All my niggas that be puttin' it down
Smokin' and representin' your town
Black trucks with the bumps
Straight G shit
I'm a Ryde for life and we ain't never gonna quit

Will you ride with me
Smoke with me
Steady, blazin' weed, by the b-a-g'z
Cold G'z got your eyeballs spinnin', hoe winnin'
Flashin' me the tongue ring
Hopin' that she can get in
Low ryde with 2 hoes in the back
With the windows down so you can catch a contact
Watch your wig flip straight to the back
Like you witness the car jack
And somebody hit you with gat
Damn
Ain't no playas when we ryde
Ain't no body playin' when we ryde
Non smokers outside suckers
Lil Poot, Lil Shank and Foe Foe
Quick to slap a bitch
Quicker to burn some endo
Let it roll the windows up
And tell your bitch quit starin'
Cause she will get fucked
Foe Foe pumpin up the Ryda Clique
And anybody got a problem with it
Keep it in yur mouth and shit

And we do it so well

If the playa hatas on the other side wanna talk
This a message from the rydas
All of ya'll can eat a dick bitch
I'm a keep puffin' my weed and swangin' my sacks
And makin' underground chedda free of income tax
Foe Foe got my back like a muthafuckin' coat

Leavin' enemies pumped up
And sidewalks wet
Ain't a neighborhood out there don't know me
I'm in a black navigator 2003
John Walsh couldn't see me on America's Most Wanted
I'll leave the muthafucker hangin' off a telephone post
Any stiches, you'll lose your tongue, you know the game
When the cops come, tou'll be tryin' to humm my name
I ain't never gonna quit, i'll ryde a black wheel chair
Pull off the strap and drop everybody here
Big Bang be the name sniffin' cane of titties
Got Rydas hot and bustin' up 57 seven cities
Now i'm only young started off servin' crack
On the street back in heat
Black hoodies and chucks
Black trucks with the fender
Slangin' that endo
Never gonna stop till they come and drop a killa down under

Well my niggas that's puttin' it down
Smokin' and representin' your town
Black trucks with the bumps
Straight G Shit

Smackin off suckers
Pistol whippin' busters
Ain't nobody trust ya
Punk muthafucka
Rydin' down the block
Black Trucks Steady Bumpin'
Hangin out the window and tryin to start somethin'
So why you actin hard and you think i'm by myself
Five niggas jump out, and beat yo ass to death (bitch)

Get the fuck out, hold up, wait a minute
Got the game unlocked, I ain't never gone quit
Fat flipper with a on top
My grease khakis come equipped with a gat
Come and get some nuts
Get slapped with a dick
Deep in the game I ain't never gone quit
