[Chorus: Madrox]:
You can probably say that you told me so
But I was never one for listening to anything
That anyone would ever tell me
Cause I had it all figured out in my own way
Regardless of what anyone in the world might say
I know now better than ever before
I know now better than ever before

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I'm yelling out, hindsight is a bitch
Cause too much focus on it can turn your life into shit
And if I knew back then what I know right now
I never would've gotten arrested at the border with the pound
I would've never got that one bitch pregnant I swear to god
And I don't even believe in a God
Kinda odd more like Gorilla Grodd
Always on that feeling side
I wouldn't change it if I could that's just how I feel inside
Feeling vilified
When I look back in the mirror and I could finally see myself with clearer eyes
Don't let your past become the future or you're minimized
What we been trying to build since we were small fries and little guys

[Verse 2: Lex The Hex Master]:
It's like I crash-landed on the top
Got going and never stopped
They was waiting to see me flop
Now I'm top 5 on the watch
Let's turn it up another notch for the homies still on the block
My niggas down in the grave or in the 6 by 8 box cause after
All this fame and all these riches
All the fake ass homies and horny bitches
All the lights and screens living without a care
I'm still prepared cause when the smoke clears
It's just me standing here

[Chorus: Madrox]:
You can probably say that you told me so
But I was never one for listening to anything
That anyone would ever tell me
Cause I had it all figured out in my own way
Regardless of what anyone in the world might say
I know now better than ever before
I know now better than ever before

[Verse 3: Madrox]:
They say you hit big and grow fast
So respect the game and hold onto your first
Cause that shit can be your last
Same faces on the way up be the same ones on the way down
That's life, she a bitch and she like to get around
So don't go falling in love with your first piece of ass
And your relationships and expectations wouldn't be trash
Mind your business and learn forgiveness
Cause this can all disappear with the quickness
So never forget this

[Verse 4: G-Mo Skee]:
Hold up Jamie
But all these niggas bitches
I always snap when haters pass the line of scrimmage
So many disses from spitting image to cryptic
I stand up to a bully, I'd lose sleep if I didn't
But maybe I should listen had to come to my senses
These niggas make money when I give em my attention
All these faces in the crowd you don't know who your friend is
But I know who the realest niggas, Twiztid

[Chorus: Madrox]:
You can probably say that you told me so
But I was never one for listening to anything
That anyone would ever tell me
Cause I had it all figured out in my own way
Regardless of what anyone in the world might say
I know now better than ever before
I know now better than ever before

[Verse 5: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]:
Keep an eye on everything coming in
Follow your heart from the start and you will never miss a win
Snakes in all environments looking to line their pockets
Don't ever stop
Exploding out of space like a rocket
Loyalty and respect can't be bought with paychecks
Gotta be earned remember that trying to cross the bridge
You oughta burn
If you learn nothing else trust in yourself
Cause some people only view you as a knick-knack on their fucking shelf

[Verse 6: Bonez Dubb]:
What but I know now in the day couldn't save me in the past
Would've been looking back and fucking laughing at the fact
That the bitch wasn't worth all the drama that she had
Lingering around like put the weed in the bag
And get it over with, it's over bitch and I'm gone
Now I'm grown boutta relearn nobody fucking with the bone
And when they do
I use the blood as the core that's why the murderin' B-O-N-E-Z is better than before

[Verse 7: Young Wicked]:
I been through a lot
I wouldn't go back and change a thing
When you a lost boy sometimes you gotta bangarang
When you were young gun killing it on the come-up
Everyone gonna have somethin' at say at the end of the day
They ain't want none nah
Me I be killing em all I'm better than ever before
Nobody thought I would make it up out of the hate but them fuckers that is hating is soft
And in a natural born, spitting factual bars
Fuck with the Axe and your gone

[Chorus: Madrox]:
You can probably say that you told me so
But I was never one for listening to anything
That anyone would ever tell me
Cause I had it all figured out in my own way
Regardless of what anyone in the world might say
I know now better than ever before
I know now better than ever before
