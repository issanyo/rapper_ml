[Dr. Rev. M. Percival Smint]
Ladies and gentlemen uhh fellow congregation members of the church
I welcome you here to a sad, sad day
Give a order to God to many more happy blessed days but nevertheless we are her together to come together to put this young man to rest!
Most people knew this here brother as an evil, rotten, decrepit, low down despicable foul mouthed monster! (Whew!)
I realize that monsters like this do not have a place in heaven
And I also realize that Hell simply will not have them because they don't want a motherfucker like this trying to take over!
Pardon my language but it must be sin
But we are here now through the kindness of our loving hearts to come together Today
To bury him into the ground with a hope and a prayer that this time he may stay dead for good!

(Blaze)
Thought I told these motherfuckers you can't kill a dead man
(dead man dead man dead man)
