[Hook: Madrox]
When shit gets better
It ain't no fooling slept
You can back me into a corner
And watch me swing till my death
I'm not dying
Ima go out fighting, I'm not dying
Ima keep on riding
If they ever think we're the ones to be sleeping on
You're on sleep we're not dying

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Ima say fuck you
And fuck you too and fuck the slut bitch
That birthed the bitch we all knew
My backs so full of knives
She promo for against it
When a fact the only lines she wanna take is from you
Split yall in half like a Twiztid check
Lemme guess yall didn't get them yet
Take my payment with a pound of flesh
Kiss the ring of the vet
I'm euthanizing all your favorite rappers like straight pets
TECs to the next on some OG Flex
It don't make no sense but i bet I'm making the front page press
Without a doubt or second guess
Make it so you don't go out your fucking house without a vest
Take a moment and close up your fucking mouth with all that mess
Don't this song make you wanna choke somebody by the neck
Until the eyeballs pop out and hit you in the chest
Goddamn being crazy the best but I digress

[Hook: Madrox]
When shit gets better
It ain't no fooling slept
You can back me into a corner
And watch me swing till my death
I'm not dying
Ima go out fighting, I'm not dying
Ima keep on riding
If they ever think we're the ones to be sleeping on
You're on sleep we're not dying

[Verse 2: Madrox]
They say be humble or get humbled
This is for real street cats that grew up with struggle
Either went to 9-5 ride or learned to hustle
Anything to bring brighter days to your thought bubble
Reality was harsher than it should've been
There you go feeling sorry for yourself yo
Queuing the violence and the police sirens
Ghetto birds are flying hood babies are multiplying
We the product of urban signs high and bothered
Is how they classify us
Three hots and a piss pot
Lord don't let em try us
Cause its enough money to pay all each and every one of us outside of jail
But when we get free
Ain't no telling who we gon care
Cause you fucking with the three side now
Got hittas and soldiers and they knowin what we about
If them wannabe ridas yall better watch your fucking mouth
Cause shit can get grimy like top ramen

[Hook: Madrox]
When shit gets better
It ain't no fooling slept
You can back me into a corner
And watch me swing till my death
I'm not dying
Ima go out fighting, I'm not dying
Ima keep on riding
If they ever think we're the ones to be sleeping on
You're on sleep we're not dying

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Fuck you, eat a dick, you bitches still ain't shit
Told you muthafuckas long ago you should've quit
Hit the bricks, watch your welcome shot by Telecom
You outta date obsolete followed by seldom
Boy them killas back its the three side
You forget gunning em because the shit is written on the hollow tips
Roll with loaded clips never say don't get cast
You ain't got the bank for a Teflon face mask
Ask yourself today a good day to die
Motherfucker get your head knocked off for giving side
Now somebody once told me killas don't talk
And snitches get stitches outlined in chalk
I live by the code of the streets, do it for the east
You must got a debt if it's fucking with me
Your homie get the body bag
Don't even try with the gurney
Its a one way trip in a hurry
Quick fast last turning

[Hook: Madrox]
When shit gets better
It ain't no fooling slept
You can back me into a corner
And watch me swing till my death
I'm not dying
Ima go out fighting, I'm not dying
Ima keep on riding
If they ever think we're the ones to be sleeping on
You're on sleep we're not dying
