[Verse 1]
You's a bitch
Trick ass, snitch mothafuca
Type bitch, sleepin' with the enemy, sucka
Don't let me catch ya slippin' in the darkness
We ain't friends, a nigga ain't forgot shit
You still a bitch, fuck your homeboys too
Got a slug for every muthafucka in yo' crew
Bitch you ain't hard, yo crew ain't shit
Take my dick out yo' mouth when you speakin' the shit
When the shotgun blasts, muthafuckin' hauled off
Ain't no escapin' the muthafuckin' sawed off
12 gauge bullet spray
And the ambulance come to take your body away
You still a bitch, ridin' to the hospital
Keep lookin' for the doctor to wire your jaw
You'll be a bitch muthafucka till the day you die
And I put that on the hatchet, my homies, and Drive-By

[Hook]
I put that on the hatchet!
I ride for my homies!
I put that on the hatchet!
I die for my homies!
I put that on the hatchet!
From the cradle to the casket!
I put that on the hatchet!
Always reppin' Psychopathic!

[Outro]
Throw yo' hatchets up x8
