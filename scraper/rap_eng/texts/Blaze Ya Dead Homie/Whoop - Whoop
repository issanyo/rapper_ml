[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I'm untouchable
Sixteen ways to die, but I'd rather just cut your throat
Unlovable
Bred through hate, product of date rape that you can't wait to cremate
I take lives with steak knives and such
I leave so many cuts that there's nothin left to touch
And I walk with the family, mind set on casualty
I put mirrors in ya eyes so ya had to see
That it had to be a mass suicide at your gathering
What a catastrophe
Front page, blame it on us
Scapegoat for all, in Twiztid we trust
In the tour bus headed for the white house lawn
I can only be the scapegoat for so long
You can clear bongs while I clear channels
Live show is sick like cups of brain matter

[Hook x2]
WHOOP WHOOP
Y'all could never do what I do
WHOOP WHOOP
Even if I became you
WHOOP WHOOP
You gotta let go of the envy
Cuz on your best day you'll never be me

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
I'm Jeffrey Dahmer with a Wayne Gacy mask on
Drill a hole inside your head, add acid till ya pass on
I mash on cubby holes and crawl spaces
UNTRUSTABLE
I'm Harvey Dent double sided with Two-Faces
Cuz I killed Jason at Crystal Lake
Stuck a axe in his back and said it was a mistake
Now the legend is dead, but the legacy lives on
Through the blood in my veins every time I spit out a song
I'm Richard Ramirez with bloody eyes
Leave a pussy stolen and swollen with bloody alibis
I'm the cat with 9 lives, the monster with 50 kills
With a shotgun, roamin' the streets of Beverly Hills
I'm in your hood like a street sign
Ready for whatever motherfucker
If you're thinkin you're gonna take mine
Another product of reality
Call it a blemish on the floor of society's vanity

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
If I cut ya tongue out and left mine in it's place
You still couldn't taste what the fuck I say
I'm a split tongue for swallowing razor blades
So I can spit blood with every word that I say
I'm poisonous, better check your thermos
Cuz I'm spiking all the coffee at your funeral service
I'm a psycho bad boy, all no-purpose
And I stuff bad bitches like a taxidermist

[Hook x2]
