[Verse 1: Blaze]
Pour out some liquor, my homie's gone and he ain't comin back
We live life fast, any moment could be our last
They call the streets a trap, most of us play the rap
With the Jesus out of reach, we fightin just to eat
To survive everyday is another good buy
A funeral procession, a family asking why my love one have to die
I want to kick it like days passed
Smoke a bunch of weed, watch Chapelle show and laugh
"I'm Rich Bitch", Remember that?
Got enough cigarettes to last my family in a bag
Saying goodbye is a bitch, hell on our homie's
Remember you forever when I'm tippin out the 40

[Abk]
We thought you'd never leave, it's too hard to say goodbye

[Blaze]
Told me you would always stay here with me till the end of time

[Abk]
Now I see that life is short and you've already gone away

[Blaze]
I only hope you hear me out, help me out with these words I say

[Verse 2: Duo]
[Abk]
I never wanted to say goodbye
I never wanted to see you die
I never wanted to let you go away
I never would imagine I'd be missing you today
I always thought we'd be riding to the end
All my homies from the hood becoming passed on friends
All my family that rids me, a goose that called me crazy
My mom and Dad and Sister that I'm missing on the daily

[Blaze]
Lost love ones are passed three years, shedding tears
Don't need pity or your cheer, I just want to be sincere
Make it clear, I dealt with tests so long
It's relative that my someone never gettin on my mother as she live
As she breath, I know she's watching this
This is why I must achieve everything that I set out to be back in 93'
One day you'll see we all deal with the other side
You love and lose, you mourn your losses in your heart
They never die....

We'd thought you'd never leave, it's too hard to say goodbye

[Blaze]
I only hope you hear me out, help me out with these words I say

[Verse 3: Abk]
At my homies funeral, I had to hear his favorite song bump
Reminisce of us, ridin' smokin' a blunt
Good times ain't as fun as they used to be
I find myself goin' back, hopin' that I could see
The memories of our childhood back on the block
Situations we got into but never was caught
I can't believe I have so many homies deep in the dirt
Too many years you've been gone, but it still really hurts
I want to see you here with us, watching your kids grow
I want to call for advice when I'm losing control
I think I'd be a better person if you were still here
I'm not bitchin' cause I miss you, I'm just being sincere

[Hook]
