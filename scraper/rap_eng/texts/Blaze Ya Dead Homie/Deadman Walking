[Verse 1]
Everybody make way for the walking dead
He says it to the wolves
And all they said, is back to the lab
With ya scientific marble
I'm alive even though I break off and crumble
Let me sleep forever and have a nice dream
Cause if I walk these streets
You're gonna hear the night scream
Trust me I don't even have a bestfriend
To find your ass murk and dumped on the west end
I'm a deadman watchin' you face to face, shiiiit!
My breathe so bad you can taste it
(Look out... here he comes)
(Oh my God it's him)
I stomp when I walk, big 6 feet 10

[Bridge]
I be a deadman walking, house or parking
Where will I fall so all ya'll can chalk me out
No doubt I'mma walk it out
That's what I'm talking 'bout bitch
Everybody shout

[Hook]
Walk it out [x4]
Walk Walk Walk it out [x2]
Walk it out [x4]
Walk Walk Walk it out [x2]

[Verse 2]
This deadman walks between evil and good
The purgatory I'm livin in is misunderstood
Through the ravens' red eyes
Beazulbub is watchin' B.L.A.Z.E
The deadman will walk it out, moon walkin' side steps
Got up and stepped into, the keeblers crib
You kept knockin' on my wave
Until I finally came out
Rose up above you and snuffed ya flame out
The clock on my neck tells backwards time
And that Ouija board ain't no hole you'll find
I know demons that'll come through and won't go back
They'll pull tha hair out ya head it won't grow back

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've gone all the way around this planet twice
Lookin' for a way of how to pay this price
All across the deserts and over terrains
If I'm dead why do I feel so much pain

[Bridge]

[Hook]
