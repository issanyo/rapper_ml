[Intro: Announcer]
Yes, Thank you
We're talking about the stars and the planets and how they Affected mankind
There's no light pollution from cities
There's no smog in the air
Night time is vivid in so many ways we can't imagine
So when night time falls the show begins anywhere


[ Verse 1: The R.O.C.]
Take my hand and i will lead you
Never let you fall from my grace, father grace has gone peaceful
Breathe deep cause we need to escape through hell before they Let us be equal
Yeah we shed tears
Fear makes us strong on the path in the riots in our mind stay Gone how long till they capture us
Only on that instagram
Pictures worth a million plus but only if they catch us stand Who we got thats going to ride with us
Only a few that will die for such
Things are free and we going to try my luck through the walk of fire imma never give up and there are some things i can never take back
No awards no platinum plaques im in debt and i ain't go no Racks and im on the pot trying to shit my last well praise the Fact that
You can lean on me tons of bombing, rise together, rise align in Strikes, to the finish line, cattle all the sweat and pain mass for Terror just to give it back
Got a thousand plus, gotta bunch they sold with the hand of God
Now we see the scenes with the speed of tron and
The atmosphere touch to them all

[Interlude: Announcer]
Hashtag that was succinct and tantalus
I wanna touch more on that
On the other side of this break
It goes far beyond personal readings again
It goes into predictions
Which have served mankind so well
We're gonna talk about the unrest of the world
We're gonna talk about how these stars can manifest different Meaning for world events
And to do that we're gonna bring on our guest


[Verse 2: Blaze Ya Dead Home]
Walk a path in the aftermath
Blood bath, Stain prints tell the story of the past
Who was last say this gods wrath
Posing sins grow within
Yo expose and he laughs
No hide in the back
No time for poking packs of shit
The gods wrath moving onto the third act
Zodiac MPrint still intact
Infecting your block like the 80s with crack
Ride or die is big as shit
Life or death threw up with
Imma see you place never quick
Key to heed him and ima spit
This is here like MJ
Popping till its M day
Sleep is like death, i can't rest
You won't tell me
How to pass the phoenix takes flight in the night
Stalking, raining down death in a firefight
Barefoot toed over space and gray
Racing time is almost up, now can see it in the sign

[Outro: Announcer]
You get a magnificent view of the heavens
And imagine how such an event, a nightly event
With a profound impact on shaping humanity's course
Their thoughts, the way they interact, how they measure time, Everything
Almost all aspect of life is dictated from above
