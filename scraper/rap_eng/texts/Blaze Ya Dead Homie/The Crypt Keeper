[Intro]
You should not have come here
You're not welcome here
This place is for the dead

[Verse 1]
They call me the crypt keeper in charge of the netherworlds
Death valley is made up of skeletons and spoken words
Vultures fly by like ghetto birds and pick flesh from bones
While they melt in the sun like ice cream cones the dead zone
Absorb'em until it rains brimstone and hot lava melt away puppet strings
Got a thousand of 'em waiting to jump if I give the word
And drag you down in the crypt without a care or concern
I hold the hour glass which means my word is my bond
And if your name appear on my list it' you I will be creep on
Of should I say encryptin no I'm not trippin I pause for a second
To reload my weapon and blast

[Hook x2: Jamie Madrox & Blaze]
You fucking with the crypt keeper
You fucked up now bitch cause I here to see ya
You fucking with the crypt keeper
You fucked up now bitch cause I here to see ya
(The sun is falling and it's raining blood
The deadman has returned to your neighborhood)
And you know I'm bout to blast break backs
Cut throats, bullet holes, gun smoke
Don't you know bitch motherfucker I'm a lay you down
And you know I'm bout to blast break backs
Cut throats, bullet holes, gun smoke
Don't you know bitch motherfucker I'm a lay you down
You fucking with the crypt keeper
You fucked up now bitch cause I here to see ya
You fucking with the crypt keeper
You fucked up now bitch cause I here to see ya
(The sun is falling and it's raining blood
The deadman has returned to your neighborhood)

[Outro]
Pour out some liquor and bow your head
And show respect to the motherfuckin dead
