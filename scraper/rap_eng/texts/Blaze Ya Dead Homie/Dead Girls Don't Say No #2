[Verse 1: Kung Fu Vampire]
My lust for women is insatiable, you already know
My love for necros is deplorable, but here we go
Bad days, friendly rape kit, role-play, Henry the VIII, you're a slave to my dungeons below the waste pit
In my bat cave, chained and whipped and smacked, wait a minute, while I'm a skinning women then stuffed in a rabbit cage
Down the rabbit hole of enrage it gets the machinery, cleanery in the coffin casket factory have to be waxing her off
It's hard to relax in a chair when the shit is so awesome, when you see us together, you stop and you stare because we are awful, soft and I'm passing a fossil to blaze the debacle
I'm a ace in your personal space in a way to your loss, giving 'em chase to the ultimate prey to erase the face of the forgotten, it's just a break in the monotony, speaking in [???], highly in paparazzi, taking naked pics of karate zombies, kamikaze, necromancer hobby uh

[Hook]
Dead girls don't say no, I don't wanna let you go, no,no,no
Dead girls don't say no, I don't wanna let you go, what's that?
And ya can't walk, and ya can't talk back, and you can't pull straps, no, no, no
Dead girls don't say no, I don't wanna let you go

[Verse 2: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
She never wanna trip or give me lip about a bitch
