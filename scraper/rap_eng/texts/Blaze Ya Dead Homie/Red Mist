[Boondox]
I got'em in my sight
Aimin' right between his eyes
Fienin' for the sight of blood
Squirtin' when the bullets fly
Decapitate a motherfucker
With that heavy ammo
Posted up on rooftop
Dressed in black latetes and camo
A crazy insane sniper
With an appetite
For that crimson tide
When arteries are introduced to light
And no I can not cope
Unless I see it in my scope
Fallen to your knees and
That red mist leaves your throat

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I'm like a 22 shot to
Your head at close range
The slug ricochets until
It splatters your brains
And no matter where it
Enters the exit is never the same
Let six shots go
The red mist pourin' like rain
So much are so squeamish
They can't stand the sight of bllood
And so they passin' out when they see me in the hood
My wounds still bleed
Like I'm a stigmatic
Red mist in my trail
Some blood still shootin' out my jacket

[Chorus]
Blood is like a river on the
Side of the mountain (fuck)
A beautiful spectacle (fuck)
I'm excited for the red mist
(red mist) Tha (red mist)
Let me see that(red mist)

[Monoxide]
Sideways your shit sprays in
Driveways like sound waves
Creating a buzz with a 12-gauge
On highways it ain't safe to
Drive I keep the window rolled
Down in case I gotta get live
And I brought Madrox with me
Pass me the axe so I can
Throw it through his
Windshield and split his ass in half
A little closer so I can check
Out the spray and let his blood tint
My window while I'm drivin' away

[Madrox]
Who ya? I'm like a cowboy
Six shooter in my hand
Lick shots, reload, and do it again
Red mist Splattered on my forearm
And fist when ya shootin' this close
It's kinda hard to miss
At a distance I can't see
Expressions of victims
Red liquid limpin' with
Holes in him ya spillin' somethin'
Precious red sand on the cement again
Till Monoxide chop you with the axe
And then you finished

[Chorus]
There are various patterns (fuck)
To the blood splatter
Although none really matter (fuck)
(I'm excited) I'm excited for the red mist)
Tha (red mist)
Let me see tha (red mist)
The afterlife is often without blood mist
Only cause it dries to a crisp (I'm excited)
I'm excited for the (red mist)
Tha (red mist)
Let me see tha (red mist)(fuck)

[Boondox]
I keep that hatchet swingin'
At yo fuckin' chest I'm aimin'
Want to see your heart explodin'
Like a fuckin' hand grenade and
I want to see your body
Drain until your life expires
Spittin' like a volcano
Spewin' black ash and fire
With Blaze and Twiztid bleed
These bitches let me testify
Line em up, sort em out
Who wanna be the next to die
I'm quick to make you dead
A geyser spraying out yo' head
Lookin' like Old Faithful
Body twitchin' in a pool of red

[Chorus]
Warm blood spray (fuck)
Red mist gently flowin' in the creek (fuck)
(I'm excited) I'm excited for the (red mist)
Tha (red mist) Let me see the (red mist)
[Hope you got yo hatchet with you
Swing'em (low)
Swing'em (high) 3x]
Tha' (red mist)
Let me see the (red mist)
[Hope you got yo hatchet with you
Swing'em (low)
Swing'em (high) 3x]
Tha' (red mist)
Let me see the (red mist)
