I remember it all...
Man there he go right there
What's up now muthaf**ka?
(Gunshots)
Now you's dead muthaf**ka
Hey Blaze
Blaze wake up
It's time to wake up Blaze
Your rest is over
It's time for you to open your eyes and wake up
It's a shame you were put to rest
We watched you
You were always our favorite
Always willing to work for the master with such little reward
Well since we took over things are gonna be a little different now
And even though 11 years is a long time
It's definitely not an eternity
Wake up Blaze
There's still work to be done
Blaze
Wake up...
