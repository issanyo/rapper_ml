[Intro]
-Expert in the devising of simple and yet effective methods of torture-
Hundreds of happy souls stretched across one black and bottomless canyon
Are you near the shore with it’s crashes, Earth, and jagged rocks?

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Everywhere I go it’s always happy till the people die
Wipe the population just by simply walking by
I’ve been here and there and everywhere
The outcome is the same
More bodies slumped over, every year I throw grenade
It started when I was little
Everything I touched withered and died
But it was only little animals and plant lives
Our power’s so strong now, if I leave the house
I know the devil come up outta hell if he get held once

[Verse 2: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Disease is airborne, not only through transfusions
You can be in the same building
And still breathe the deadly fumes in
I’m immune till they keep me in tomb, cause I’m a carrier
And hopes that they can use me as a weapon to clear the area
The sickness mutates to the point it integrates
Potential called disasters, to great for you to failsafe
You can’t keep an animal caged that wasn’t meant to be
I’m transforming the most sinister plague of the century

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
(Spread the sickness)
I will not die again
(I wish it would end but)
I don’t wanna be alone anymore
I don’t wanna feel the pain anymore
(Spread the sickness)
I will not die again
(I wish it would end but)
I don’t wanna see the face anymore
I don’t believe in any faith anymore

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Post up in a bed, surrounded by dead bodies
With an IV in my arm and the sickness still inside me
Faces of the deceased all mutated with disease
And the pattern of the bruises lookin' like swiss cheese
Intestines on the outside, scattered on the floor
A nurse’s tummy bursts nearly inches from the door
Everybody’s dying and dead and no doubt
All I remember was checkin' in, bleedin', and blackin' out

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox]
Birds and airplanes fall from the sky
From a two hundred and fifty mile radius and die
In the beginning people only lost their breath
And their eyes turned black and they were clenching on their chests
Now my power is so intense and effects so stay away
So depending where you’re at will determine how truly safe
You are and by the time I turn a hundred and eight
Simply by thinking I’ll be able to kill aliens in space

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Monoxide]
I don’t know how I survived
All I know, it’s like a dream and I’m the only one alive
I’ve never heard a scream or a cry
Again really I’m not even sure that in the process of what happened it even died
All I smell is death in the air
And I can see the bugs crawlin' on the bodies laying everywhere
Walkin' in the valley of death and I believe that I’m the last one left
Now I don’t wanna know what I’m ordering
I’m thirsty enough to take a drink
Out of the bottles that’ll slowly start to fill up with blood
And I’m the only one breathin' that I’ve seen in a week
And I weaken, I need to eat so I know this ain’t a dream
But I scream at the top of my lungs, nobody comes
But I can hear my voice echo all the way to the sun
Somebody really forgot me, we’re in it, Earth’s won
And I just wanna know why am I the last one?

[Hook]
