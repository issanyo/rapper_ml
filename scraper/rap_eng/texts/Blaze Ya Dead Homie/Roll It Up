(Blaze)
I'm in the car, to the door, in the bar, to the dance floor
Lookin' for the ladies, with the wiggle real low
I see you movin' like a snake, rhythm huggin' your curves
Shakin, like ain't nobody shakin' better than her
House is packed, we're moving from front to back
Took my seat in VIP, and ordered a Cognac
Pull out my product sack, and commenced the break down
Here baby, you puff? grab up a seat and sit down

(Chorus x2)
We gon' roll it up, come on girl
Pour some more drink in my cup (turn it up)
You know that I came to get right (turn it up)
And the party don't stop till sunlight

Four blunts later, and two and a half bottles of Don P
Followed by four shots of whiskey, had me tipsy
But I still had game
And thoughts are still running up in ol' girl's frame
Now I don't pimp skirts, I lift skirts
And then serve, my dang-dang and beat it up until your 'nanny hurts
What do you say we leave this place, and get a bit to eat
And maybe after that I can toss you up, in the backseat

(Chorus x2)
We gon' roll it up, come on girl
Pour some more drink in my cup (turn it up)
You know that I came to get right (turn it up)
And the party don't stop till sunlight

Back in the car, now we on the road
Is when she acting all freaky, out of control
Said the way she worked up in the club, that wasn't shit
And I should see her when she butt naked, working the dick
Ain't no point, just imagining
I'm headed to the Quality Inn, to get some quality skins, from this trick
She put it on me, then straight f**ked me to death
But ain't no stopping a player when there's still a blunt left

(Chorus repeat until end)
We gon' roll it up, come on girl
Pour some more drink in my cup (turn it up)
You know that I came to get right (turn it up)
And the party don't stop till sunlight
