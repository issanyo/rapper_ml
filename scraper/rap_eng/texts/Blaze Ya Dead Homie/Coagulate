[Intro]
Dark Lotus

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Stomp the fear in on the painted blood
Now your dreams are what the creatures love
I know it seems I got a demonâ€™s lung
My mind is really where all the screaming's from
I don't care if you believe my tongue
You've been warned, you better tell someone
We don't leave until you're just as dumb
And we don't rest until the rest is one
And I bring the darkness with a crew so heartless
Don't matter if you're homeless and not lookin' to start shit
Everybody walking on two feet and breathin' my air is a target
I could really give a motherfuckin' less regardless
Ain't nothing you can do when the Lotus is back
And you lest us, this'll be the darkest

[Verse 2: Violent J]
If time was alive would you try to make it your bitch?
Would you speed it up or slow it down with punches or kicks?
Try to control its power, say when it dongs and ticks
Or would you stop and try to rewind it and learn all its tricks?
Well you're just wasting your time, nobody controls it's pace
Bitch if you stare at the mirror age will creep over your face
Warm blood goo coagulate the same way as we vanished
Even new born cuties will all get old and be banished

[Hook x2: Jamie Madrox]
Watch as you fall from the sky
(Blood, blood, blood)
See it solidify
(Blood, blood, blood)
The only thing that can purify is
(Blood, blood, blood)
So tell me who's here to die for (blood)
Who's here to die for my (blood)

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
Vast pools of blood, blood
Bitches I be swimmin', swimmin'
Voices in my head, crazy eyes, see me grinnin'
Lookin' at the person in the mirror lookin' back, back
Covered in blood, heart attack
Covered in blood, grab the gat
Put it to my temple but I don't pull the trigger cause I ain't ready to shoot myself in the head
Realizing I'm a ghost and I'm watching the blood coagulate around my body cause I'm already dead
Blood, hole, dark, petal
Lotus flower, bitter, sour
Blood, power, take focus
Take focus, Dark Lotus

[Verse 4: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Blood seeds are the ones that pose
Clock tickin', awakin' on youth
Coagulate, five petal Lotus and I'm peekin' at truth
Back in the news with nothing to lose and much to gain
Ride together deep in your veins
Red out the open artery, in the blood print we remain
Embedded, so dead and know the bullshit
That you're spreadin' is quite irrelevant
Like tryin' to turn a pornstar celibate
And it all depends on who get it in
Born again christians on our missions
Time to bear witness, Lotus sickness
Infectin' the [?] , calls on their missions
Pray for forgiveness, way out the business

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I was baptized in a pool of blood
My vision been red, can't repent
I'm a grown man, now my mind in the flood
Mama said I have lost my sense
They're aware that I'm mad, all I hear in my head
Is the beat of a heart, I gotta make it quit
So I got me a knife and I stabbed a fool dead
It's just another life and to me it ain't shit
Couple of minutes of peace, finally
Put all of this bullshit behind me
I wish it was just that simple but it ain't
Cause I'm still just a Juggalo rockin' this paint
And fuck what you said and fuck what you heard
And fuck apologies, too little too late
So I take my fuckin' hatchet
And split your fuckin' head
And watch your blood coagulate

[Verse 6: Violent J]
Dark Lotus will explode us and then corrode this
The souls from beyond the sun are the ones who verbode us
As was told to who moved on the lost son of osmosis
So plant your seeds in that dirty mud cause hell's be the grossest
So don't be scared to water them with blood, the stems will grow fast
The great knowledge of the future comes from knowing your past
The five petals of the pod come from the God you trust
Is it odd this is forever Dark Lotus
