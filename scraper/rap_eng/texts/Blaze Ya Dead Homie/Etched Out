..."What the f**k are you lookin' at!?"

(Chorus)
Which one of ya'll wanna get etched out in chalk
Better watch how you talk when you talk the talk
Better watch how you grip when representing your shit
You ain't seeing none of my clique
That's for life bitch
And that's for life bitch!
(And that's for life bitch)
And that's for life bitch!
(And that'd for life bitch)
Better watch how you grip when representing your shit
You ain't seeing none of my clique
That's for life bitch

(Blaze)
So know I show up with a shotgun, enough shells to blow holes in err'thing
Bloody up the walls, the windows, and the curtains
I'm for certain, this sucker right here
Gonna die like a bitch motherf**ka right here
Get that ass chalked up, I'ma trace you
Pull out the twelve gauge pencil, and erase you
It takes two to tango, so I brought four
And in the glove box, shotgun shells galore
I came for war, and leaving with a piece of your head
So I can look at it, when thinking about that shit that you said

(Chorus)
Which one of ya'll wanna get etched out in chalk
Better watch how you talk when you talk the talk
Better watch how you grip when representing your shit
You ain't seeing none of my clique
That's for life bitch
And that's for life bitch!
(And that's for life bitch)
And that's for life bitch!
(And that'd for life bitch)
Better watch how you grip when representing your shit
You ain't seeing none of my clique
That's for life bitch

I might send you where the bitch motherf**kas, go when they die
Fresh out the belt line, with the chrome 4-5
Better get to an exit, that vest ain't going help
Dump the whole clip, make sure my presence is felt
Drive-by! and I ain't got to be in the car
I do a drive-by, on a Haro wit no handlebars
I do a walk-by, blasting at you out of the blue
And what a bitch motherf**ka like you gonna do?

(Chorus)
Which one of ya'll wanna get etched out in chalk
Better watch how you talk when you talk the talk
Better watch how you grip when representing your shit
You ain't seeing none of my clique
That's for life bitch
And that's for life bitch!
(And that's for life bitch)
And that's for life bitch!
(And that'd for life bitch)
Better watch how you grip when representing your shit
You ain't seeing none of my clique
That's for life bitch

Now if I unload the heater, I'ma reload the heater
And make sure to splatter blood on your khakis and wife beater
Ya'll bitches ain't leavin' alive
When you cross me, you cross the chalk line
Now prepare to die
People is bleeding, bitches is screaming
Suckers running into cars, and driving away speeding
I'm in the backpocket looking for chalk to trace
The ones who can't walk dead, are trying to crawl away

(Chorus)
Which one of ya'll wanna get etched out in chalk
Better watch how you talk when you talk the talk
Better watch how you grip when representing your shit
You ain't seeing none of my clique
That's for life bitch
And that's for life bitch!
(And that's for life bitch)
And that's for life bitch!
(And that'd for life bitch)
Better watch how you grip when representing your shit
You ain't seeing none of my clique
That's for life bitch
