[Intro]
Haha, re-re-remix, bitch!
(Throw me that fire!)
We creepin' in, too, baby!
(We got 5 on errything, man)
We got uhh, Lavel
(Shaggy!)
We got uhh, Twiztid!
(Monoxide, Madrox!)
Esham…
(ABK!)
Big Blaze and Violent J!

[Lavel]
You say you got five on my tender?
You can bend her over the table
But be sure that you bring my stallion back to my stable
Say, bro? No Elementary school-ground playin'
Not a five dollar bill, a five-double-zero, on the real feel
I'm stayin' on the level, stayin' mellow
No criticism from the fellows, hello!
Being keyed doing a high-speed, but still don't tap the B.B.s
I'm busy, Lavel, you can't see me

[Madrox]
Like nyquil, I drop fever
So either put your five up, or you got to “leave it” like Beaver
Cause see a, niggy perpin broke'll, smoke your spliff all day
Go home and buy drinky with his pretty then parlay

[Monoxide]
I got five on the Hennessey, Seagram's, or 40's

[Madrox]
Cause “this is how we do it” like Montel Jordan
I'm from Detroit city, Frank Nitty is a goner
I'm blowin' it up like Oklahoma

[Esham]
Put ya feev with my fin, and best believe we'll bend
Mo corners than you thought, till something right is bought
Mo c-zacks? Best believe that, tokin'
Where you from? Oakland, I mean Detroit, smokin'
In attempts to crack the chest plate
The zips be so fluffy, the whole town loves me
At every event, I'm sacked up
So if ya need me, scream “ESHAM” when ya see me

[Hook]
I got five on it!
(Got it good!)
Grab your fo
(Let's get keyed)
I got five on it
(Messin with that endo weed)
I got five on it!
(Got it good!)
It's got me stuck
(And I'm tore back!)
I got five on it
(Partna, let's go half on a sack!)

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Why you treat me so bad?
Grundy makes it happen
Fives get slapped, and revenue grows
From just a little bit of lightweight flamboastin'
Potent fumes lingerin', mighty clouds of northern lights
Disrespecting victim banning, and you'll be violating my civil rights
I'm startin' to feel my skrilla
But perhaps today my skrilla ain't feelin' me
For the simple fact that I'm off the track where
Hella fools be
Pockets empty, pitchin' five, man I'm dusted
Took off my hat, passed it around, now sprinkle me

[Monoxide]
Me and Blaze comin' fifth plus
Yo let the lead bust
Ready to do a murder, man
Perved off the Hurricane
Slurred again, witness what bein' off two-fifths equal
Me killin' people like Jason, facin' death every sequel
(Insane in the membrane!)
“Bring the Pain” like Method
Neglected
Smokin' kryptonite to the brain for breakfast
Guzzle the endo, finna do the evil that men do (?)
Give me feev I shall proceed to continue

[Hook]

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Yeah, it's been awhile since I spit it from the D-town
Fuck around, heard Paul and Jamie say
(Lemme get through ya shell)
Cause new styles is goin down, look around you
Twiztid and the Fam spread it all around you

[Violent J]
I'm back to get my O on, I get my flow on
With thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it
Still bringin' satin for them drawers
Velvet for the mic, and got a pound for the cause

[Anybody Killa]
Rollin' up cannabis sativa
Hittin' the Mary Jane
Smokin' the five before it's 12 o'clock, sippin on Hurricane
Ready to smoke on the endo, rolling up my window
Fin to go to the 'land
With a handful of broccoli, when it comes to the sticky
I'm the man
Kush nasty, I be hittin' the J so hard I hurl
Fall on the floor, finna have a stroke THC ain't no joke
I got five on everything, lets get loaded and smoke
Cause ABK about to hit it and croak!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Aww, yeah, wassap baby?
It's me, your boy with game that's always tight
You a little short on some ends?
Don't worry 'bout that, I'll take care of that, I got five on that
I got you
