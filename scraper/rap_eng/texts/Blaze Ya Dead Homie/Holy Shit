[Intro: Violent J]
"Holy shit!"

[Hook: Violent J]
All I have to do is roll up
(Bumps beating out the truck)
All I have to do is show up
And everybody like “Holy shit!”

[Verse 1: Blaze]
Step out the car, I’m out to the bar
They flock from afar like “Holy shit!”
Walked through the door, heard a little more
From folks on the dance floor “Holy shit!”
Order up a round for hoes in the lounge
Throw a little money down “Holy shit!”
I don’t play games, they all know my name
And show me respect when they say “Holy shit!”

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Blaze]
I fired up a blunt of that super skunk
And everybody in the club like “Holy shit!”
They like what you smell, wanna know if it’s for sale
I pull out the scale and they like “Holy shit!”
Bag up the dub sacks, increase the paper stacks
Bitches can’t hold back like “Holy shit!”
Took them bitches no doubt, you know what I’m about
Let me hear the Juggalos shout “Holy shit!”

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Oh!
Oh, oh!
Oh, oh!
Oh, ohh!
Ohh!

[Verse 3: Blaze]
Up to the next spot, pull up on the block
System in the truck and it’s like “Holy shit!”
Ride up on the curb and the peoples’ heads turnin’
The bitches steady burnin’ like “Holy shit!”
They like what I roll in even if it’s stolen
The window’s broken like “Holy shit!”
They love how I’m living cos it’s unforgiving
And the gang rags expressing how I’m feeling “Holy shit!”

[Hook:]

[Bridge]

[Verse 4: Blaze]
When I show up, the spot will blow up
A block party what’s up like “Holy shit!”
The sounds that I bump, makes everybody jump
Psychopathic Rydas still dump like “Holy shit!”
Bitches titties shaking, got that ass breaking
Popping non-stop like “Holy shit!”
They like looking for attention, they got it did I mention
Never any tension like “Holy shit!”
They love what I’m saying, the shit I’m creating
It’s truly unmistaken like “Holy shit!”
The dead man no faking, unfazed by hating
Never be replacing like “Holy shit!”

[Bridge]
