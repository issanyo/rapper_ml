[Blaze:]
Solomon was the father, the casketmaker
In 1920 something, he was the undertaker
Who outlived everyone until the day he tried to die
And jumped in the freezing water so starts the timeline
1980 something one summer evening
Come out that same water he came ah-creeping
Wtih tattered clothes soaking wet from head to toe
Where he happened he had not know, no boots
Solomon was lost and confused in different times
He knew he didn't belong he could see it in her eyes
So he fled in the alleyway like the homeless
Cause at this point in time his life was hopeless
Killing himself didn't work a bit
He only woke up 60 years in the future, revived his shit
Alive was dead still waiting to become the transformation into Blaze's son

[Chorus:]
I keep changing feeling strange and watch as
I metamorphosize, well
Time keeps ticking in the Timeline
Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline
Ticking in the
He is the father and I am the son
And together we become the great undying one, well
Time keeps ticking in the Timeline
Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline
Ticking in the

Blaze the son, was a gangsta work
He live by the gun, and died over trying to sell one
To a baby G, from a set around the way
Things are way different now, from way back in the days
Solomon would have never sold a piece
He'd only build a couple caskets
The house, alter the season
Blaze on the other hand, loved killing everything
And then what he took, to get his hands on some money man
From selling crack rocks, on street blocks
Hood famous as a dead thug
Always rocking a clock
Following numbers up the clock, making doorways
So anyone who would oppose, would die and just go away
He never died, no his wounds never healed
Never stopped to think, how shitty that got to feel
But it's okay, cause he's changing again
To fulfill the destiny, of Colton Grundy's brethren

[Chorus:]
I keep changing feeling strange and watch as
I metamorphosize, well
Time keeps ticking in the Timeline
Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline
Ticking in the
He is the father and I am the son
And together we become the great undying one, well
Time keeps ticking in the Timeline
Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline
Ticking in the

Colton is the great one, never will he perish
He's not concerned with the life, that so many cherish
Not concerned with looking for love, that they claim that is
He's heartless, he dead, he's proud, he's not embarrassed
Move back, no time, the clock is broke
Never had parents, he was conceived in smoke
Father was just a premonition of a past life
Or the life he never stopped living
His story began right, it didn't
Still confused and I don't get it
He is I, and I am him, I never had decendents
I never had any father, and I am like my brother
To sum it all up, we're all the same motherfucka

[Chorus: x2]
I keep changing feeling strange and watch as
I metamorphosize, well
Time keeps ticking in the Timeline
Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline
Ticking in the
He is the father and I am the son
And together we become the great undying one, well
Time keeps ticking in the Timeline
Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline
Ticking in the
