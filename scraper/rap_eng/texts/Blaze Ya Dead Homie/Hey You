"Hey!, Hey bitch! What the f**k?! You can't hear or something?! Hey look ho, you looking for a motherf**king thug?"

(Chorus 2x)
Hey you (Who me?)
That's right (What's up?)
Let's go someplace, so I can lace you up
I need a thug bitch, about as raw as they come
Hold me down, hold my dick, cover my shit, it's on

(Blaze)
Hey love, do them titties got a name
This is dead body game let me see you shakin' something
I ain't impressed by hoes with attitudes
I'm impressed by the way them hoes is mad at you
I ain't spending honey real G's don't shed funds
I ain't sensitive like Brian McKnight, I'm tryin' to f**k
Remy and Coke, dick all in and out of your throat
Until that bitch started to choke, no joke

(Chorus 2x)
Hey you (Who me?)
That's right (What's up?)
Let's go someplace, so I can lace you up
I need a thug bitch, about as raw as they come
Hold me down, hold my dick, cover my shit, it's on

Hey bitch, do your momma know you outside
Hanging in the passenger window, of my hoo-ride
And I can barely see the ass, stacked off in the pants, and she talking real fast
The bitch kinda smelt like fish and chips
But boy did she have a set of dick sucking lips
Told her what she wanted to hear, so I could get all in her cat
Dead homie all up in her cat, now picture that

(Chorus 2x)
Hey you (Who me?)
That's right (What's up?)
Let's go someplace, so I can lace you up
I need a thug bitch, about as raw as they come
Hold me down, hold my dick, cover my shit, it's on

Hey bitch hoe, I need a thug bitch hoe
What's you say you let me keep a hold of all your bankroll
I won't spend it all in one place
And I can shoot a load to cover your whole waist
All up in your face like a true thug
All in your shit, in my eyes you only worth what you come with
I want shit like your pockets
But what about the 'dro?
Come on you know I got um

(Chorus 2x)
Hey you (Who me?)
That's right (What's up?)
Let's go someplace, so I can lace you up
I need a thug bitch, about as raw as they come
Hold me down, hold my dick, cover my shit, it's on
