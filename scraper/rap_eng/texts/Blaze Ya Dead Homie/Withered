[Verse 1: Violent J]
Like a fucking fantastic solar eclipse or comets passing
The lotus is in bloom stopping time never ever lasting
Like a velvet red sunset
A cloud formation it takes away your breath
Your frozen in the moment till nothings left
Much like a northern light show
Tornadoes ripping through a vacant land
Theres a lotus in the sand
Pluck it, hold it in your hand
Lotus is forever and when it whilst away
Its eternal root are deep (deep) forever here to stay

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I'm all alone again no one to talk to
Nobody wanna be the friend that I want to
I thought you could come through and help
But instead you just left me to wither in hell
Now how can I tell the rest that I'm leaving
And the cause of death is the season
I change up and I wither away
Resurrect in the moon when the sun turns grey
When I watch em all turn away
There's not a thing that I can do except watch it all change
I can listen to the trees speak to the weak leaves
As they fall like soldiers in war
As they form a pile right in from of my eyes
All praise to God for these other four

[Hook x2: Violent J]
We rejuvenate we again resurrect
We revitalize and we keep coming back
And they say where did it go to?
(where did it go)
And they say where did it go to?
(where did it go)

[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Once again it's last curtain call no need to fight it
(No need to fight it)
The scripture of the brotherhood opaque have all been recited
My pollination will float through the air and keep carrying on
(Carrying on)
The moon shines this light on us for that I thank God
Now we out with an unquenchable bottomless thist
We going out in a blaze of glory so call up the hurse
You can pick off all the leafs but yet the roots still remain
Again with so much to gain flourishing in the black rain

[Verse 4: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
This is the end of all things
Reign of all kings
Sun burnt out from within the winter wind
Loss of the sun and the time that it brings
Years pass out without any meaning
Most stay sheltered and hide out from the cold
Lyrics frozen to the ground as the wind blows
Lotus wilts away and it regrows
Those who we chose adhere to the cold
Could never be told and never be sold
Tales of the history lies of the old
We will never be lost and never be gone
Written in the stones of the never-after mold
Our existence is withering to regenerate
Reincarnate, it's only fate they can't hate
But rejoice with the voice of the new world we decide to create... Dark Lotus

[Bridge x2: Violent J]
Time waits for nobody...always ticking, moving on [x2]
...Dark Lotus
Where did it go to?
Where did it go?
And they say
Where did it go to?
Where did it go?
...Dark Lotus

[Verse 5: Jamie Madrox]
Everything they live, finna die, who am I
Just another motherfucker asking
How did it slip by so quickly?
Lotus is in the Water, so many to chose
And He decided to pick me?
I'm amazed as I'm withered and I spend my last days
Once was in bloom, my petals faded away
One by one, try to get â€˜em to stay
Till the outcome became deflowered and decayed
Now I need to regenerate, everything to die
Fittin' to live every second in life, it's like a gift
I'mma take it in the present and spend it the right way
I'mma put it to a song they gonna' sing and play
And when they hear it, hopefully they spirit'll listen
And they won't spend all of they life just wishing'
Stop, and restart... forgive, never forget
And never live any life buried in regret
