[Verse 1: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I'm a man of the ledge
Saw me up, send me over the edge
I got ticks, psychotic fix like a bullet got lead
Sick in the head, man it got him sick in the streets
Corrupted, fucking illegal junks in the gun function
Watch it pop off, the hood ain't soft
When it comes to cocktails we bout them Molotovs
Crack the bottle off all full throttle at the salon
The march starting off, you say stop it till way past dawn
Go to soul ya protest won't turn violent
With my cane in ya brains, go ahead you wanna sign it
Thinking back like allure do, call that bitch a seal
Like the dead bitch and hang the rope in hell we meet again

[Hook: The R.O.C.]
You trying hard but you can't hide (can't hide)
We're simply sick of your shit, move aside (move)
We want what's ours, keep your motherfucking peace (no peace)
Let's tear this motherfucker up, chaos in the streets
You trying hard but you can't hide (can't hide)
We're simply sick of your shit, move aside (move)
We want what's ours, keep your motherfucking peace (no peace)
Let's tear this motherfucker up, chaos in the streets

[Verse 2: Boondox]
I gotta confess, all the social unrest
Is giving me a reason to get some shit off my chest
Enough is enough, we way past discussion
Time to target the players, this system needs a concussion
Grab your torches and pitchforks, to boost for the kick doors
Drag em in the streets to let 'em know what we piss for
Flip over limousines, Tahoe's, and Crown Vic's
The monarchy's dead, we ain't falling for Crown tricks
Believe me they ain't ready for these 7 billion citizens
Lock the funny loaders screaming louder, say I'm killing Sam
A revolution, I say fuck the institution
We been hoarding indignation
It's time for redistribution

[Hook: The R.O.C.]
You trying hard but you can't hide (can't hide)
We're simply sick of your shit, move aside (move)
We want what's ours, keep your motherfucking peace (no peace)
Let's tear this motherfucker up, chaos in the streets
You trying hard but you can't hide (can't hide)
We're simply sick of your shit, move aside (move)
We want what's ours, keep your motherfucking peace (no peace)
Let's tear this motherfucker up, chaos in the streets

[Verse 3: The R.O.C.]
Chew through the straitjacket, can never hold me
I'll go free and cause havoc, Shinobi
My Majik Ninja swords got on me, only boldly go
Where the insane goes lowkey
I hear the, channel place slowly, causing harm to the public
Voices all made no calm like a brawny weapon
We rush it like quarterbacks that crush it with the dead and I love it
Its all our saving, its fuck the pedal mine and I touched it
I'm taking lives and there's no peace of mind
That ain't great escape, where the lights are meeting the fight
Chasing 'em through the night, call the law if you dare to incite
Those madmen, nothing's really been and the chaos can now begin

[Hook: The R.O.C.]
You trying hard but you can't hide (can't hide)
We're simply sick of your shit, move aside (move)
We want what's ours, keep your motherfucking peace (no peace)
Let's tear this motherfucker up, chaos in the streets
You trying hard but you can't hide (can't hide)
We're simply sick of your shit, move aside (move)
We want what's ours, keep your motherfucking peace (no peace)
Let's tear this motherfucker up, chaos in the streets
