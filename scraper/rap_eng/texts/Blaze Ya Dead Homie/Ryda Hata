(Talking)

(Twin Gats aka Myzery)
Are you a Ryda hata? If so you ain't shit
And i'll tell it to your clique when i'm emptyin' the clip bitch
You get the dick and i'm fondling your chick
Wit' my lips around her tit, an my stick all in her clit
Now who she wit'? the Ryda!, now you hatin it
I see that mark buck on my dawg, chasin' it, wastin' it
Drop ya bitch off, i'll get inside her lata
I pack a MAC-11 for all you bitchass Ryda hatas
(Cell Block aka Blaze)
Are you a Ryda hata, you best check yo'self
Or get knocked out wit' a left right left
Watch yo' step, hold your breath, drop the heat
Or find yourself wakin' in my backseat
Of my car, you never know who we are
Ridin' 'round the city like some superstar
Pimpin' hard, lots a cash, and pullin' cards
If you wanna step, mother fucker let's go to war

Hatas, we (buck, buck!)
Ryda hatas we (buck, buck, buck!)x2

(Bullet aka Violent J)
Hate a mother fucka, you hate a mother fucka
Just 'cuz a brother got butta' motha' fucka what!
Bitch!, it's time that I check that chin
Appologize fo' it then check it again
'Cuz i'm not kinda friend when i'm takin' a bottle of the Rose
I might swerve ya nose
That's how it goes for a hata that hates, and i'm greater
Bullet be the hater exterminater
Chorusx2

(Lil' Shank aka Jamie Madrox)
You can hate me, because I ride like the wind
And leave yo' ass waitin' for love like Cardigans
I'm a thug bitch, and i've been that way forever
Never spend no cheddar on a bitch no never
Whatever the fuck you think you talkin' about
Well it's hard to hear your words with dick up in your mouth
All that hatin' shit is out and i'm all up in this bitch
Ryda for life, and I ain't never gonna switch
(Full Clip aka  Shaggy 2 Dope)
Ryda hata's what the fuck, yo I can't stand'em, talk shit behind my back
And yo' lips get smacked
Talk shit to my face, get pistol whipped in the face
Thrown in the torture rack, your back gets braced
Gettin' mace'd in ya eyes, dome gets Karate chopped
Cock the gat back, blaw! you got dropped
Run your body over wit' my..black truck
Hater-ass, stupid, mother fucker, piece of shit, duck!
Chorusx2

(Cell Block aka Blaze)
Are you a Ryda hata? you's a bitch-ho
And noone really cares what your mom think though
'Cuz it's all about the money, black trucks and bumps
So shut your mouth, get on your knees and take your loss
Chorus

(Foe Foe aka Monoxide Child)
You's a Chontsy, flat out bitch, you ain't shit
And fo' real-doe yo' bitchass'll die quick
Fuckin' wit' the clique, boo-yah we won't miss
Leave ya standin' still in a puddle of piss
If you's a Ryda hata, then I annihilate ya
I'm mobbin' up on your set like a space invader
Easy to contain ya like a rat
I'll smash ya wit' my baseball bat, because I rose like dat beotch!
