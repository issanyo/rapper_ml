[Monoxide Child]
Now that I'm dead and gone, look at me I'm floatin' like the breeze
With my roots strong like trees, I'm filtered in your memories
Holdin' a candle like vigil, sayin' a prayer in my name is graced
Burried with the paint on my face
I put the chase up long enough, I lived the lifestyle wrong and tough
And now my life spans up
I give a fuck, I'm 'bout to run it in the afterlife
And hopefully they put my soul in the butcher knife

[Shaggy 2Dope]
"If I was to die" It'd make a lot of people happy
No funeral possessions, no plot at the cementary
Finally, I can be alone in my own world
The wagons come take me away from the killing fields
"If I was to die" Would you finnaly shut your mouth
Understand what I am? Understand what I'm about?
Like Kurtz place me up high on your pedestal
I'm 'bout to find out "Shaggy it's time to die"

[Hook]
I wanna die, so I can see the otherside
I wanna die, so I can fly (Take me with you)
I wanna die, take me to the otherside
I wanna die, so I can fly (Take me away)x2

[Violent J]
I wanna die, maybe i'll get angel wings
So I can cut'em off, cook'em up, have some helly Wing Dings
I'll take my Halo off, get myself a ladder
Hang it on the wall, maybe you'll think it's a gold record
Death, everybody follow my hearse
Why does everybody always gotta go and die first?
Before they homies are missin'em, and family member's kissin'em
Everybody, even enemies stop dissin'em
I wanna die, so I can haunt my buddies
Stand behind them in a mirror with my eye's all bloody
Stick my long, black, cold tongue all in they ear
And be like "I'm only playing" and disappear
I wanna die and have everything answered
What happend to my Father? Why was I a bastard?
What is thunder, is it really God bowlin'?
The night time's a blanket, and the stars are the holes in it?

It's done, answer's are un-necessary you understand
You never question the emotions of an unstable man
I got the petals of a Lotus and the pedal to the floor
Following a black hearse in the rain through a thunderstorm
Never once did I invision, me being stuck in such a situation
He made decisions, now a spirit levitatin'
I can see'em wavin' at me through the window of the hearse
He's crying blood, it all stop's and it get's worse

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Atleast that's what I was told, when I was on the come up
Been to the grave and it ain't no joke
Resurrfaced to the earth with the spirits I invoke
Cut down in my prime when my clock got hit
Now I'm riding in the back of a hearse and shit
Darkness, pitch black, never seem to know one
And the Devil got his darkest demons ridin' shotgun
