[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Chain smoking and heart broken I'm focused
Brain blowing I start showing I'm hopeless
Heroin is my new name and I'm the dopest
Shit you even shot in your veins and chose to notice
No remote so don't try to control this
Haywire put me on the screen and I explode
It's one, two, three, worldwide threat
Fuck with us we'll have you're girlfriend x-ed

[Verse 2: Madrox]
It's the multiple man and I'm deuce in line
With a gauge to your dome about to free your mind
Before pimping was a hustle we was on the grind
Between fame and power it's a thin line, give me mine
We outside looking for a way in bitch
Trayside representing to the mother fucking finish
You don't want none, we got guns like C. Heston
And quick to lay you flat on your back without a question

[Hook: Monoxide & Madrox]
One, two, three, throw up your sign
It don't matter where you're from, everybody can ride
One, two, three, throw up your sign
It don't matter where you're from, everybody can ride
X2

[Verse 3: Blaze]
What you staring for, are you loked out like me
First up to bat with a forty it's Colton Grundy
Kick the dirt off my cleats, keep my hand on my heat
Cause my life is the game and I live for the streets
Yes sir, you don't want to catch no strays
From the other end of my AK when it sprays
Base hit, spill somebody's blood on the pavement
Buck willin', you know how them thugs get

[Verse 4: Madrox]
If you don't know how it came to be
Verbal attack from the likes of not one but three M.C.'s
And it stands for malicious cobras
Hot tracks locked and loaded we show no love
One, two, three, triple threat like fuck any set
Three fingers in the air is how we represent it
We came for the pennant, the crown and the throne
And if you act hard, hell yeah, bitch it's on

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Madrox]
You can't stop this onslaught off the chain
And this side of ours is so deranged
And you don't wanna try your luck
Guaranteed first wrong move be the one to get you fucked up

[Verse 6: Blaze]
Two double O five and we keep shit live
Every day ain't nothing you can do or even say
You know what, fuck Shane Douglas, we the franchise
Save your time sitting and praying for our demise

[Verse 7: Monoxide]
We taking over like Sheed in the paint
With a dunk nuts all in your face, I'm first place
Legendary for the scariest shit you ever heard
To the point they wanna ban us from you're local suburb

[Monoxide, Madrox, & Blaze]
Three, two, one, threat representer
It's hard to be right when you're left of center
And can't nobody out there do it any better
No matter how many beats and rhymes they muscle together

[Hook]
