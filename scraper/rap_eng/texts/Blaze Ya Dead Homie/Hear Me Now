Blaze Ya dead Homie:
Our style is Dynomite like the Kit!
If your havin problems hearing you should turn it up a bit!
Do You Hear Me Now?
The perfect melody of sounds and percussion
Rattling the trunk its that Bumpin'
Ain't that somethin?
It's that brand new your not accustomed to
Not that wack commercialized shit
Its all Crew
Put a blog on the radio
Pop it on CD or MP3
And listen to the realness of the streets

Anybody Killa:
Can you hear me?
Bumpin thru your hood actin real
And I be the one
That the public don't like dealing with
Call me an earthquake
Shakin up the system
Can you hear me now?
Because before you wouldn't listen
Pay attention when I speak
You might learn somethin'
Open up your ear drums and just stop frontin'
Situations that you shouldn't be in
Probably could've been avoided with advice from a friend

(Chorus)
We the Drive-By Boys can you hear me now?
East side Detroit can you hear me now?
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Can you hear me now?
We the Drive-By boys can you hear me now?
East side Detroit can you hear me now?
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Can you hear me now?

Anybody Killa:
Sometimes I feel like the world's gone deaf
All the problems in this Bitch
Cuz no one offers they help
That's why were taking what we think we deserve
Tired of strugglin' going coastal
Just in case anyone's wonderin
Neighborhood loud ass
Can you hear me yellin' out from the top of my lungs?
So clearly
I'm so sick and tired of being the last one heard!
So sit back and listen up
Or get kicked to tha curb!

Blaze Ya Dead Homie:
Can you hear me now?
Is your volume up again?
Can you picture me rollin'?
Over corners that I can?
The beat strong knockin'
Ass end droppin'to the beat
Collecting money from my hoe's workin' that concrete
Staying on top of they game
Can you hear me now?
Me and my partners are sayin'
That I'm winnin' how?
Just go to town and We ready to ride
Stayin strapped and on call
Like Doctor said to Drive-By

(Chorus)
All that I hear is people talking into me ear
But the crazy thing is they never been clear
All that I hear is people talking into me ear
But the crazy thing is they never been clear
All that I hear is people talking into me ear
But the crazy thing is they never been clear

(Chorus)
