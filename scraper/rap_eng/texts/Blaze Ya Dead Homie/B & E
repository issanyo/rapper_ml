[Verse 1]
I broke the front window of the house
There wasn’t any stirring and the lights were still out
I crept through the hole
And my feet touched the floor
And the sound of the wood made a creak from below
Ain’t nobody home, I’m alone and in the zone
Rummaging the room for what’s yours to make my own
The TVs so sweet, wrap the screen in a sheet
Haul it all to the window, that’s one room complete
My B&E

[Hook]
Against the joy, I’m making sure nobody’s coming
Get straight to the point; I’m making sure nobody’s coming
Looking over my back, I’m making sure nobody’s coming
Load it all in my sack; load it all in my sack

[Verse 2]
I stepped in toward the back room and heard a noise
It sounded like a dog out chewing on his toys
And just like a stopwatch, the sound stopped
And in through the door walks a full grown Rott
He looked real fierce, his teeth pierced with a grin
Like you don’t know who the fucks house you broken in
I shot him a grin out from the kitchen
I opened up the fridge and said “here boy, dig on in”
My B&E

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Someone’s coming, here they come x3
Should I start running? Here they come
Someone’s coming, here they come x3
Should I start running? Here they come
Ooh, false alarm

[Verse 3]
Continue loading goods out the back of the crib
To the truck of the car, I can barely close the lid
Now I’m back in the house, take the picture off the fireplace
Grabbed a crowbar, and I crack open the safe
Snatch the money and the jewelry
This ain’t nothing new to me
Then I see the lights through the window
And I freeze, hear the keys
I flee, I speed up the street
If I’m caught, doing 5 to 10 stretch like a dream
My B&E

[Hook x2]

Load it all in my sack
