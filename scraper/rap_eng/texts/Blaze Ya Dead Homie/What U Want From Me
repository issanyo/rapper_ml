[Verse 1: Anybody Killa]
What do u want from me?
Be the question, don't you think that I gave you enough?
What about the time I took you out
And just bought you all types of crazy stuff
This world ain't nothing different, I ask it everyday
What the fuck do I gotta do, so everyone can see it my way?
If I could I would be a millionaire
And help out the poor cause it's good to share
And keep away from the ones that front
Always taking what you giving cause they steadily want
So what more could you want from me
Would it make you happy to watch me bleed
Or are you sticking around to just see
If a killa like me is able to achieve, what's up

[Hook: Blaze Ya Dead Homie & Anybody Killa]
Don't be standing around looking like a dog on a leash
What do u want from me?
Don't be acting like we friends, and you won't be deceased
What do u want from me?
Don't be acting like you know everything I'm about
What do u want from me?
What you want, is what you goin' get without a doubt
What do u want from me?

[Verse 2: Anybody Killa]
What do you want from me?
I'm just askin', cause you look like you need some help
And the only thing left that I got to give
Are these rhymes I use myself when I'm angry
I just get so confused, think to myself what do I got to lose
There's nothing more for me here to prove
So from here on out I'mma act a fool
What do you want from me? I might as well ask
Cause I'm kinda in a giving mood
I got free advice for the ones that hate
This motherfucking nuts for you (bitch)
I'mma walk with my head held high through these trails of tears
Cause I have nothing to fear, ya'll
I'm Detroit's first native representing
87 it was written memorized ready for spitting dawg

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Anybody Killa]
I'm so proud to die and I'm proud to live
And I’m going to scream it to the world til my lungs give in
If there anything I got that you think you deserve
Then next time contest my nerves, or it's all bad
Crazy, psycho, not right in the dome, leave me alone
So fed up and don't know what to do
So now it’s time to ask from you, help me

[Bridge x2: Anybody Killa]
I know you think I’m crazy
I do it for you, I do it for you
Even though it true I’m crazy
You crazy too, you crazy too

[Hook x2]
