[Monoxide]
Now I'm smoking like a chimney with the purple kush up in me
I'm really on cloud nine, I got aliens sittin' with me
So many seem to forget we will smoke until your eyes get peeled
So every now and again we gotta remind ya bout the smoker deal
One, never smoke it brown and two, not if I don't break it down
And three, if we ain't fuckin', don't be touchin' on my thunder now
My mouth is gettin' dry and you can see the veins in my eyeballs
Looking like I just doused 'em in alcohol
I light a Newport, I'm also addicted to menthol
And I'll be smoking till the coroner calls, and my plants are all tall and fluffy
And when I'm checking my buds I swear to God I start to dance like Puffy
I'm old school like a huffy and a set of roach clips
And if you notice when you looking, I got the resin on my lips
I put a halfy in a paper and you'll never see it drip
And I'll smoke it till it burns all the way down to my fingertips

[Hook]
I'm so high
And I'm never comin' down, never comin' down
I'm so high
Never ever gonna touch the ground, ground
I'm so high
And I'm never comin' down, never comin' down
And I'm never gonna come back down

[Jamie Madrox]
I'm so twisted and smoking Jane gets me lifted
I sip hypnotic till my bladder's full and I'm pissin'
I only smoke bammer if it's carefully sifted
To avoid sticks and beans from splittin' the seams
If it's weak smoke more
What you think them zig zag packs come packed
With thirty-two leaves inside for
If you're lucky enough to be blowing gan
You better hit it like a pro and hold it as long as you can

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
We get high like everyday
We smoke weed like everyday
We rather die than be dry, so don't play
So if you don't wanna smoke get the fuck out the way
We get high like everyday
We smoke weed like everyday
We rather die than be dry, so don't play
So if you don't wanna smoke get the fuck out the way

[Violent J]
I'm fucking doing good, I can afford my habit
Seven hundred dollar sack a kush, watch me grab it
I'm a fool like that, smoking in the parking lot outside of court
I'll get you higher than the airport
I know you tryin' to be a homie, passing me that tree
But you fucking with professionals and rookies get beat
I fucking slap kids passing me the buster brown dust
I get insulted, leave you with your crown bust
I fail piss tests and give a shit less
And you's a fool like a motherfucker thinkin' you gon' hit this
Back up off me softly, your puke hittin' mine
Even if you catch a contact it's your quittin' time
I'm riding with Madrox, we smokin' up mad blocks
Attling the street, leaving smelling like Woodstock
Get some hatchet in your life, get some matches and light up
A fucking plant with me, boy we family

[Hook]
