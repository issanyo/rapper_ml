[Intro]
Show me what you got, baby (2x)

[Chorus]
Baby show me sum (4x)
You might be the one (4x)

[Verse 1]
She got them double-D's
And look at shawty's thighs
Imma fuck her like
Imma think I'm Plies
I'm on that need-a-need-a need some ice
I got some codeine
And the pussy appetite
I'm bout to fuck 3 bitches
Before I end the night
Can't get enough, can't get enough
Like Berry White
Rolling (4x)
Like a bike
I put them Karates in my chain
It hurt your sight

[Chorus]
Baby show me sum (4x)
You might be the one (4x)

[Verse 2]
I got this young bitch out in Texas
Call her Sky
She wanna see me
So I put her on the flight
I call her Whitney
That's how much she need the white
Nickname Narisa
That's how much she need the pipe
She gave me the pussy
Cause she glanced at the Rollie
I can't make her mind
Cause she fucked like 500
Damn I'm feeling good
I might smoke some weed tonight
Made a little extra
Might just hit OT ight
You might be the one
I can not pretend
Girl, you really bad
But not bad as your friend
I wish yall was twins
This won't be the end
After you show me what you got
The end
Pardon, me
I'm not your average nigga, baby
I'm with Travis Porter
And we like to switch them ladies
I got racks on me
That strap on me
That pack on me
That gasoline
Got a thug but she only fuck with strap on me

[Chorus]
Baby show me sum (4x)
You might be the one (4x)

[Verse3]
Girl, you saying that you got it
Go on, show me
And if it's good then
Imma hang it like a trophy
Don't gotta worry, baby
Imma hit it right
She eat pussy
I do too, girl It's alright
Now, baby open up your mouth
Cause I'm the dentist
Where you need that filling babygirl?
Cause Imma fill it
Baby, I'm the doctor
So tell me where it hurt
I use that line everytime
And I swear it works
Yeaahh, uhh

[Chorus]
Baby show me sum (4x)
You might be the one ...
