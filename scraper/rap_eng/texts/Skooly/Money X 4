CHORUS

Snuck a pint of mud right up in the club
We be pouring up we don't give a f***
Ice in Double Cup when we're pouring up
Bought a pound of gas just to blow it up

(money money money money that money money money money that ) repeat twice

Ice in Double Cup when we're pouring up
Bought a pound of gas
Mud mud mud mud

OOLA DA BOSS

Double Cups of the mud
When I walk up in the club
B****** be showing me love
Them n***** they knowing what's up
Money money money money that money money money money
Twenties fifties and hundreds
My n***** on ground for the summer
My b****** is spoiled
They getting whatever they wanna
They ride for their daddy and grind for the summer
Stacking money we can count that ma≈àana
Hop in the 4-wheel or hop in the Hummer
N**** you know that I roll with banana
Moving the price I be jooging it proper
Locking the city that's word to my mama my n**** I'm gone

CHORUS

Snuck a pint of mud right up in the club
We be pouring up we don't give a f***
Ice in Double Cup when we're pouring up

Ice in Double Cup when we're pouring up
Bought a pound of gas

Spodee

I got your b**** in the club
Politicking with the thugs
Filling my body with drugs
I got this s*** out the mud
I'm moving just like a slug
I got that lean in my blood
In California with my cuz
F*** round and met me a plug
Give me the pounds and the pints of the perp
And then give me the blow
You really don't need her
She's digging my people so give me your hoe
She gave me her money
I looked at lil baby like give me some mo
I just hit Lennox with Oola
We got enough moolah to buy out the store

Strap Da Fool

Money money money money
Thumping thumping through them hundreds

I got the pack and it's on me right now

Thousand pints in counting white man

Stripper girls running when we walked in
Ten thousand n**** I'm the boss man
No cash n**** we ain't talking keep gas major league balling

And I probably got it on me
You are not with it homie

Diamonds all in my ring Tru on my chain

Still flipping through the hundreds
Still changing all the channels

Bankroll Fresh

Pull up I'll sell you a half
Pull up I'll sell you a bag
Pull up I'll sell you a split
Pull up I'll sell you a brick

Open my door with the stick
Open the door with the hammer
Try it for sure we gone blam you

In Magic going to take home a dancer
Give you a bag for a sample
