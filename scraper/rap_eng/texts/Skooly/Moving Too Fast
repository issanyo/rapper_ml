[Intro]
Moving too fast
Feel like i'm losing gas
What you going to do with that
Boy you a fool
Feel like I'm
Moving fast (feel like I'm losing gas)

[Hook]
Feel like I'm moving fast (moving too fast)
Like i've been doing the dash (shit)
Feel like I'm losing cash (shit)
How the fuck you do that

[Verse 1]
You suppose to be getting you some cash
I thought you wanted the bag
I thought you wanted the jag
Why the fuck you out here playing, Tell me
I don't understand, these niggas these days
What you really want?
Some money or the play?
Money or the fame?
Money or the chain?
?
Oh you too gang gang
Is you?

[Hook x2]
Feel like I'm moving fast (moving too fast)
Like i've been doing the dash (shit)
Feel like I'm losing cash (feel like I'm losing cash)
How the fuck you do that

[Verse 2]
I gotta give them the truth
I gotta ?
I want a brand new coupe
I know my momma do too (feel me?)
Out here fucking up the money
Slick going out bad
Marathon for the money I can't end up last
I was born with the swag
I wasn't born with the bag
