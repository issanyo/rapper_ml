[Intro]
Uh huh, uh huh
Yeah, okay, look

[Verse 1]
Different type of nigga, I want different type of figures
Make a Christian read the bible, have her screaming out the scriptures, look
Ain't no fuckin' riddle, I got Benihana extras
I got armor issues, different niggas wanna harm a nigga
They say daddy who's your son? I'm like all I do is stunt
Hop out Rubicon, rockin' Louboutins, I'm shooting guns
Concrete, make your heart beat, hard for you to beat us
Fucked a bitch for her fuckin' features, almost had a fetus
I'm your teacher, I'm your fuckin' teacher, I'm so conceited
And my bitch she's a fuckin' diva, no Mona Lisa
Poured a three in my fuckin' liter, I can't feel my fuckin' features
And I was taught not to fear no evil, I grew up with regals, ooh
Ooh, ooh, fear no evil, I grew up with regals
This is how it is, this is how I am now, uh
Trifling ass bitch, don't text me from her man house, okay
Make her leg lock, make sure that her leg stop (pin her down)
Flintstone shit, make her fucking bed rock

[Chorus]
Pin her ass down, make her fucking friend watch
Spin that ass round, make her fucking head pop
Don't turn that shit down, ain't nobody said stop
Don't turn that shit down, ain't nobody said stop
Pin her ass down, make her fucking friend watch
Spin that ass round, make her fucking head pop
Don't turn that shit down, ain't nobody said stop
Don't turn that shit down, ain't nobody said stop

[Verse 2]
Different type of glamour, I need different type of cameras
Talking different type of standards, ain't no motherfucking amateur
Plus I bought her sandles, plus I'm from Atlanta
Got her Gucci bag, told her get my coochie bad
It ain't no war, we beat 'em, it ain't no boss can feed us
Bitch I'm a dog I feed ya, bitch I'm a dog I eat ya
I'ma go insane (ride back), I'm off the chain (aw man)
Look at her frame (goddamn), look at her frame (goddamn)
Okay, I done upped my figures, bout to give your ho the business
Got her trippin', in here strippin', 'bout to give my partner feelings
Better watch your bitch, got it, got your bitch, this is not your bitch
Yeah I got her in here ironing shit, in here lining shit
Yeah she fine as shit, in here fine as shit, in here high and shit
In here hidin' shit like bitch that's not my shit
Bitch you trifling, bitch you nosy, magnifying glass
Baby fine as shit, and I can't try the bitch 'cause she be signing shit
At the door, I got plenty more, rock out any show
I was broke, mama was always home, daddy was selling dope
Got a ho, got another ho, hot yellow ho
In her mind, I get in her spine, got her grabbin' roles

[Chorus]
Pin her ass down, make her fucking friend watch
Spin that ass round, make her fucking head pop
Don't turn that shit down, ain't nobody said stop
Don't turn that shit down, ain't nobody said stop
Pin her ass down, make her fucking friend watch
Spin that ass round, make her fucking head pop
Don't turn that shit down, ain't nobody said stop
Don't turn that shit down, ain't nobody said stop
