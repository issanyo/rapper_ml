[Intro]
Blacc Jon Gotti
Baby, you know you...
You just do something to me you know...
I don't really mean to sound like a sap, baby you just...
(Ayo, stop all that talking man)
Fuck it

[Verse 1]
Look...
They envy your walk
Empty my heart out and empty my vault
Look, look, look
This shit here hurt
Missing your face and the time that we talked
Look, look
You gone be first
I promise girl, you'll get the diamonds out there
Now it's time for this work
Take off your diamonds and pearls
I'll beat that pussy up first, I'll beat that pussy up worse
I'll make you nut in that skirt
I'll do the back move while you rubbin' on my tattoos
And they all on the left side girl
Got-got you on your wet side girl
You gone get the best of my world
You fuckin' with a youngin' from the Westside girl

[Bridge]
Would you be down for a young nigga?
Would you be down for the boy?
Whenever you call, ima come get you
It could be all outta town, I'm going
Shawty stayed down for a young nigga
Shawty stayed down for the boy
Never leave my side, not for one minute
Never let you out my life no more

[Chorus]
Would you be down for a young nigga?
Would you be down for the boy?
Would you be down for a young nigga?
Would you be down for the boy?
Would you be down for a young nigga?
Would you be down for the boy?
Would you be down for a young nigga?
Would you be down for the boy?

[Verse 2]
I'm... outta time
No tick tock
Would you be here all the time like my wristwatch?
Would you still be mine if that bitch stop?
Like, hey let’s go, like bitch stop
And I sip a lot of lean, need a pit stop
Plus I got you sippin’ lean, it's in your piss now
Ima have to sip some lean when you pissed off
Nigga playin’, what you mean?
He’ll get picked off
I just went and bought a beam for the pistol
Ima hit him on the scene, leave ‘em right there
Baby girl you a dream and a nightmare
I just need you in my life yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Would you be down for a young nigga?
Would you be down for the boy?
Would you be down for a young nigga?
Would you be down for the boy?
Would you be down for a young nigga?
Would you be down for the boy?
Would you be down for a young nigga?
Would you be down for the boy?

[Outro]
Down for a young nigga
Down for the boy
Call, ima come get ya
It could be all outta town, I‘m going
Down for a young nigga
Down for the boy
Not for one minute
Out my life no more
