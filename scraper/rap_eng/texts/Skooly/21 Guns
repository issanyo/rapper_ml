[Verse 2: Skooly]
I turned 21 and bought a handheld chopper
My brother used to hide his fucking bricks inside my club
My mama was mad about that shit inside my club
But I gave her profit off that shit inside my club
Dripping like a faucet, wishes in the water
Dripping tone, I'm alone in that whip, I got no problems
Flexing money where I'm from'll get you robbed bitch boy
You must of not heard I'm with the mob bitch boy
This is not no motherfucking job bitch boy
Only cops that I'm scared of is cobb bitch boy
Come around flexing jewelry tryna flauge bitch boy
