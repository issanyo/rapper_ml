[Verse 1: Sas]
Shooter Chanel, plug out of college, he sent me a bell
Drivin' the Beamer like it's a Chevelle
These niggas be fronting', they [?]
Make a phone call to my niggas, they coming
I got a top with the push of a button
Let her have [?] in the air
I'm blowin' kush in the air
You know all my niggas in here
This all the shit that I wear (yeah)
Red bottoms, a thousand a pair (yeah)
I spend money like I don't care
Nigga I should be the mayor
Choppas in the trunk like it's a spare
Nigga we never shoot up in the air
Let my [?] you, you better beware
Your bitch on her knees, like she sayin' a prayer

[Verse 2: Skooly]
Look, who is you kiddin'

I'm with a bitch and she drivin' me dazy
Got daisy dukes on and I'm right up here pimpin'
See, I'm tight with the [?], the jury I got see shining and glistening
The pistol I got, see it gon' pop when I hit it
Don't stop when I get it, I start when I'm winning
Currently I'm am just shoppin' at [?]
Came from the [?], I'm shoppin' with bitches
Say you gon' get it, I got it, I get it
Tell them lil bitches stay out of my business
Talk bout' them niggas, they runnin' they mouth

Kill em' (oh)
We can not leave with no winnings
