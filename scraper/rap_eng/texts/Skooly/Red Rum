[Chorus: Skooly]
What you need now, I got what you need
Fuck on a thot, I can't live with no freak
Red rum shit, murder she wrote
Pay for that ass, she bring it to me

[Verse 1: Skooly]
I eat that pussy all day, then I go ghost
Pop me a pill, then I put on a coat
She as bad as she wanna be
Don't even talk on the phone to me
Enough with that shit, shauty talkin shit
Gotta be caushous, young Skooly a sargent
I got some problems, and I got a carbin
You better not be startin shit, flip like a daulphin did
I still be poppin shit, Mozerati thot
I really got the whip, I really got your bitch
She wanna ride the dick, big colossal clip
I drop the shit, I didn't have a pot to piss
Now I got guap in the V, I sellin out shows, you know I be rockin shit
She pussy pop for this, take off her top for this
I think I need to watch a trick, the Rolli don't toc or tic

[Chorus: Skooly]
What you need now, I got what you need
Fuck on a thot, I can't live with no freak
Red rum shit, murder she wrote
Pay for that ass, she bring it to me

[Verse 2: Kollision]
They know I'm delirious, taking these lil bitches serious
I turned that ho to an eater, only cause that hoe was curious
All of my bitches be open, I'm kickin' shit from the grove, man
She suck the dick till her nose start hurting
I put that dick down her throat, I'm stuntin
When I was broke, found it hard to function
I'm going in, nigga, all or nothing
Niggas be talkin, not fuckin'
Soon as I see them, they don't say nothin
I ride with Skooly, don't ride with flunkies
12 ain't around, we trappin' in bunkers
I get her things, I feel like she deserve it
I cannot eat her, if she do not serve a purpose
If she ain't worth, fuck her once, then curve it

[Chorus: Skooly]
What you need now, I got what you need
Fuck on a thot, I can't live with no freak
Red rum shit, murder she wrote
Pay for that ass, she bring it to me
