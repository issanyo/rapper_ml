[Intro: Johnny Cinco]
(Yea)
(Fuck niggas, Bussin down swishers)
(Coo, Yeah, Yeah)

[Bridge: Johnny Cinco]
I might pull up Ashton Martin on em fuck niggas
I might pull up super model bussin down swishers
Super model bitch giving head at the red light
Super model bitch giving head after bed time

[Hook: Johnny Cinco]
I might pull up Lamb, is you mad?
I might pull up counting cash, is you mad?
Pull up blowing gas, is you mad?
I got 45 stacks, is you mad?

[Verse 1 : Johnny Cinco]
I been trappin' all in Paris, selling dimes in a villa
Trynna stack another milla
Marble floors, marble ceilings, Nigga (Nigga!)
Took a plane to London on a Sunday, trynna get it on a Monday
That's that foreign money, That's that foreign money
I got 3 or 4 spots, that's why they mad (that's why they mad)
I can pull up Lamborghini or I can pull up Jag
25 hoes, that's why you mad (that's why they mad)
Gimme 25 days & I can make a bag
Me & Skooley hangin' out that Lamb
Walkin' out that COA with money in my hand
She gone suck me anyway, cause she know I'm that man
Is you mad?

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Johnny Cinco]
Just a young rich nigga working with a bag
Just a young rich nigga switching foreign tags
3 or 4 rentals at a time, 3 or 4 rollies just to shine
I traded my iPhone in for a beeper
Old school trapper, new school rapper
On a speed boat running to a red snapper
Trade my red bitch in for a yellow bone
My bitch got me feeling like the man
Hopping out the air plane with codeine in my bag
It's John Popi, yes I am
I drop 20 on yo bitch, the reason why they mad

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Skateboard Skooly]
Trynna turn a hundred to a thousand, every minute of the hour
Bad ass, turn a sweet bitch sour
Then I bought that Breitlin for the shine out the time
The jeweler charged me 9, glad I ain't drop no dimes
And I'm trynna break the bank, Every time I buy some drink
Fuck you think, John Gotti, John Popi
Hoppin' off that plane with pints
That's why they hate, they some cowards
They gone hate me with the power, killed my brother all he fuckin sold was powder
What they mad at?
Bought my bitch a bag with her bad ass, go see the dealer with that cash for that last Jag
In a hood full of takers with a bag of cash, can you imagine that
That's why they mad me

[Hook]

[Bridge : Skateboard Skooly]
I might pull a no show on you fuck niggas
Million dollar man, swag of a dope dealer
Super model bitch giving head at the red light
Super model bitch giving head after bed time
