[Intro: Skooly]
What's poppin'
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good

[Chorus: Skooly]
I cut a couple niggas off
Then I got paid, damn
Cut a couple bitches off
Then I got laid, damn
Cut a couple niggas off
They ain't mean me no good
Cut a couple niggas off
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good

[Verse 1: Skooly]
Cut a couple niggas off
They ain't mean me no good
Held me back from bein' a boss
Show you niggas what it costs
Show you niggas how to floss
Show you niggas how to ball
I'ma turn you to a boss
No them niggas weren't my dogs
No them niggas wasn't down
Take my name out your name
Don't you come back 'round
Don't you come back 'round
You can't come back 'round
Turn it up, won't turn it down
Ran it up and held it down
Switched it up and got it now
OG fronted me a pound
Now my brother gettin' it now
Now my mother gettin' it now
Don't you come back 'round
You can't come back 'round

[Chorus: Skooly]
I cut a couple niggas off
Then I got paid, damn
Cut a couple bitches off
Then I got laid, damn
Cut a couple niggas off
They ain't mean me no good
Cut a couple niggas off
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good

[Verse 2: KIDD]
Fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
I hit the club and I bring all the bottles and sparklers out
The winter, the fall, the summer, the spring
The trap beating, we ain't seen the drought
I'm workin', workin', work my ass off
Straight from the street, that's that asphault
My new bitch get money like Kash Doll
What the fuck you think I get this cash for?
My youngins shoot shit up like Chiraq
I don't like promotin' violence
I dare a young nigga to try me
Put that dope in the water, that Pyrex
Yeah I'm my daddy's son, yeah I'm my daddy's son
I put my OG on, I put my OG on
I hit the jeweler and put a new Rollie on
Flood it with diamonds, no these are not rhinestones
VVS diamonds, no these are not rhinestones
I flew to Cali and switched up my time zone
They be like, "Damn, KIDD, what you ridin' on?"
Eyes bloodshot red like a cyclone
Fuck them niggas, they wasn't with us from the go
All these pussy rappers stole my brother's flow
Straight to the top, that's the only way to go
Straight from the block, I was posted at the store

[Chorus: Skooly]
I cut a couple niggas off
Then I got paid, damn
Cut a couple bitches off
Then I got laid, damn
Cut a couple niggas off
They ain't mean me no good
Cut a couple niggas off
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good
They ain't mean me no good
