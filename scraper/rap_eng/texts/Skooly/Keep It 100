[Hook - 2 Chainz & Skooly ]
Pull on the vallet and look like wings on my shit
Talking sideways put a beam on that shit
Ain't no Activis so I lean on my bitch
I brought her with a bad bitch, I got her fiending for this
All that I need is a gun, I promise to keep it 100
The coupe ain't come with no keys, not when you spending 100
A nigga think this is a disease, can't even keep it a 100
I keep it a 100, my pocket look so with the cheese
How many niggas with me ? I think it's a 100

[Verse 1 - Short Dawg]
Half of these rapper sucks, they nead a pacifier
Truth be told the other half are liars
[?] more will do in the foreign coupe
Rings on it like a appetizing
Got a life fresh where you've been
Nigga that's personal
I'm doing a verse more because the work is slow
Keeping it 100 like the purpose's goal
I'm authentic keep my car's tinted
Probably cause I got your broad in it
The way she walking got my palms itching
Money talks and mine is long-winded
The TRU up on my charm glisten
Got more oil in it than a car engine
Because niggas know I'm from the H town
So I'm coming down like a partition

[Verse 2 - Cap 1]
Making all of these fucking Gs
They can't even keep it 100
I got the trap bumping, nigga what you want ?
Probably put in your order
I got them birds in the water, that's on my son and my daughter
I made a half from a quarter, I might hit this helling business
Nigga fleeping pigeons, bought a Rollie flood at the border
TRU thats la familia
I can make a phone call and I get rid of you
You can't have this bitch; I don't even consider her
We offin' them pounds like Jennifer nigga
The trap phone steady ringing
Money count and steady spinning
I just put a pound of Lenix
We got this shit from the tranches

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Skooly]
Married to the game, need a ring out this bitch
I'm may go insane, I'm not the king to this shit
I'm a zombie, I want brain, i'll be feinding for this
Wooh, that shout never changed ain't no reason for it
Trying to get the lean out of my piss
Trying to get the Gs out my bitch
I had an uncle, used to smuggle, got 4 keys in this bitch
So many Gs in this bitch, but I'm not easy to spill
[?], I was the dope, I'm the lean in the seal

[Verse 4 - Kaleb]
When it was small faces, I was keeping it 100
Spend the 10s, 20s, 50s all I keep is the 100
My money here, don't come stop it because it [?] just like money
And my kilo like my car, yeah the Porsche do 200
I'm riding for all of my niggas, no car pull
Professionals with the music, we pros with the tools
How can I lose ?
I came her with nothing, go nothing to lose
We out there, [?], got quality music so how can we shnooze ?
