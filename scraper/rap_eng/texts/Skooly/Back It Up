[Hook: Skool Boy]
She want bank rolls, on bank rolls, on bank rolls
On rolls
Said she got a main mode
She want pesos
From her ankles to her nose
Shorty gotta play ya crib
Gotta pay the bill and her car note on her own
When she get on that floor she know

She gotta Back it up, Back it up, Back it up
But don’t stop
Back it up, Back it up, Back it up
But don’t stop
Back it up, Back it up, Back it up
But don’t stop
Add it up, just add it up, add it up
But don’t stop

[Verse 1: Kaelub]
I ball player
Future passed it to me, caught it like a ball player
Said one job ain’t enough
She wanna shake it up, so I pay for her L’s
Shorty thick with that shit
Sit with that shit, money she it get it well
YG but a big homie
Tell friends drive with me but that young nigga hell
Player spot new car off the lot
Strip outta town so her people won’t see her ahh
She at the paper day in and out
Stacking it up but she ain’t gang banged out
Back it up like 6’o-clock traffic
If you ain’t talking money she ain’t hitting static
Don’t make excuses she the type to make it happen
Slipped and it pilled off now she want bananas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Future]
Shawty she ah back it up, for a nigga with a sack
No Santa Clause
I got Floyd Mayweather bread on me right now, right now
I make her lose her draws
She gone take off on the floor
And go all the way to the ceiling
What she do for a rich kid
She ah never do for you this a feeling
You can’t get back, She ah back back
For bout one stack, For bout two stacks, For bout three stacks
I ain’t Andre, I am Ms. Jackson
She bout that Action
Pass that to young school boy and young Kaelub
And that’s a lay up
Ah to some players
We can’t save her, we can’t save her
So we pay her

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skool Boy]
Meet miss money

See shawty get the money and she split it with me

Show another nigga bitch kung fu when she kick with me
