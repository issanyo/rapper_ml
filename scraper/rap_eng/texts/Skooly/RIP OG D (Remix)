[Verse 1: Skooly]
And we look on a mother fucking dapper don
West side yeah you have you one
Not the motherfucking average one
Im the one who didn't ask for none
Wait till you pussy niggas ask for some
Laugh in your motherfucking face
Bring wrath to your motherfucking place
Put a slash on your motherfucking name
Cause i ain't in this mother fucking game for no motherfucking name or no motherfucking fame
Well maybe just a little bit of name
Cause these bitches doing anything for a little fame
(Im) in it for a little bit of change
Get my family off the motherfucking ground
If i have some problem get my family out of town
Pussy niggas playing put your family in the ground
And them niggas hate still i just took a motherfucking pill give a fuck how you pussy niggas feel
Have you Niggas stuck, when shit really get real
Getting fucked in a pussy nigga deal
Coming up niggas had it hard
Young nigga came from the block
Neighborhood shit don't stop
Too loyal to the motherfucking mob

Middle fingers up to the coppers
At the spot with the Glocks and the choppers [?] (Yeah Forreal)

Now all my crimes white collar (shh)
Hit the dice game, hit the car lot (skrr!)
Bad bitch bringing me the dollars
And i got the piss four dollars

Don't sleep, so no pillow talking
I'm the realest in the 'Ville no steel, gotta tiptoe, cause I feel I'm getting followed
Count so many Hundreds blue ink all on my fingertips
Shout my uncle Bun, RIP to Pimp
Put it on my patna for the rest of my life
Have my money, have my family, have my respect I'm gon' ride
