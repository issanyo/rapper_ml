Waitin' on shawty tell me fall through

Look, I ain't mean to hold up or stall you
I just want to ask you can I call you
I just want to pull up and fall through
Lookin' at that ass, is that all you?
You a fool, you ain't have to make it hit like that
You ain't gon' tell me where you get that?
You got that ass from your mama for sure
From your mama for sure
Now you make him mad, throw his money for show
Throw them hundreds for sure
You're so beautiful, nice as they come
Talkin' bright as they come
In my universe you can't be stopped
'cause you're number one
Fresh out the house like I'm going to prom, smellin' like bomb
They see me shining way before they come, way before they come
Iced out my bitch and I iced out my boys, I iced out my boys
Iced out my wrist and I iced out my charm, out my wrist and my charm
