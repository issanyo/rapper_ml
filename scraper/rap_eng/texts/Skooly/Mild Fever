[Intro]
Catch the drift, I'm Odell
Catch the drift, I'm Odell
This right here is a mild fever

[Chorus]
Catch the drift, I'm Odell
Poppin' shit, I'm top shelf
I'm protecting myself
Still protecting my wealth
Take the rest of my pills
Pop the rest of my seal
I been neglecting my health
But I invest in myself
I do that myself for myself
I don't do that for nobody else
Have sex with no thottie
Can't accept your apology
I can't X nobody
But I can't bless nobody
Ain't tryna stress nobody
Ain't tryna catch no body

[Verse 1]
I been movin' and movin' and workin' my ass off
Can't erase none of my past off
We in here havin' a gas off
Your bitch in here takin' my pants off
Da fuck am I saying my bad for?
I didn't say sorry the last war
Couldn't even afford a Jansport
I hit the gas, take the gas off
So into the speeding, I'm Evel Knievel
So I went above the dashboard
I treat the streets like a drag course
Tryna avoid the task force
I spend them racks, I don't ask y'all
I'm out here doing the dashboard
Tek got the Tesla, I match up
I got the Mazi I asked for
(You said you wanted a Jaguar)
But you got two hundred on dashboard
This ain't no regular ketchup
They won't be able to catch up
Interior look like Polynesian
Bottom my shoes look like ketchup
Mama told me it's no pressure
I didn't mean to upset you
Don't play with my young niggas ever
Lil' KG my brother forever
They say the birds of a feather
They always flocking together
So we gon be rocking together
We gon be rocking forever
I got your back like a sweater
They know I come from the slums
And I'm going dumb
They know how I come

[Chorus]
Catch the drift, I'm Odell
Poppin' shit, I'm top shelf
I'm protecting myself
Still protecting my wealth
Take the rest of my pills
Pop the rest of my seal
I been neglecting my health
But I invest in myself
I do that myself for myself
I don't do that for nobody else
Have sex with no thottie
Can't accept your apology
I can't X nobody
But I can't bless nobody
Ain't tryna stress nobody
Ain't tryna catch no body

[Verse 2]
It's an honor just to be in your presence
It's a blessing
Different times call for different measures
I wasn't desperate
Lose your brains out here 'bout two or three necklaces
And you can't blame me 'cause the game ain't chess, it's Louis V checkers
Who is you flexing?
Move my momma house 'bout two or three exits
Just to be careful
I'm in my own lane home
I took the long way home
Only the strong stay strong
And only the real survive
Nothing sincere in your heart
I can see fear in your eyes
How many will survive?
How many killed to die?

[Chorus]
Catch the drift, I'm Odell
Poppin' shit, I'm top shelf
I'm protecting myself
Still protecting my wealth
Take the rest of my pills
Pop the rest of my seal
I been neglecting my health
But I invest in myself
I do that myself for myself
I don't do that for nobody else
Have sex with no thottie
Can't accept your apology
I can't X nobody
But I can't bless nobody
Ain't tryna stress nobody
Ain't tryna catch no body
