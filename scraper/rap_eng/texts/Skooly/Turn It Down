[Intro]
Gotti, ah
They gon' hear you, oh
They gon' hear you

[Chorus]
Girl you know you gotta turn it down
Girl you know you gotta tone down
Girl you know you gotta turn it down
Girl you know you gotta turn it down
They gon' hear you outside, they gon' hear you outside
They gon' hear you outside, so girl you know you gotta turn it down
Gotta turn down, you know you gotta turn down
They gon', they gon' hear you outside

[Verse 1]
I heard you got a flight to catch, I'm tryna get involved
Fuck the dresser and the counter, we using the wall
Tick-tickle pussy pop 'til you give me what I want
Fuck you with my thumb 'til you show me you can cum
I hope you ain't a child, hope your mama let you come
Let's go have some fun, let me show you how it's done
Give me head while I roll up, fuck  me while I smoke this blunt
Fuck you like I'm young, show you why they call me Don
I bought a Birkin bag just to show her I'm the one
Ride her like pump, she even ask to see the gun, she
Helped me move a ton, she ain't lifted weight once
Like damn man, this bitch might be the one, uh
Bitch about her money and you still make her scream
Well that's the kind of bitch a nigga need on the team
I been on my lean shit and she been off the scene
What the fuck you mean? shawty is a dream, goddamn

[Chorus]
Girl you know you gotta turn it down
Girl you know you gotta tone down
Girl you know you gotta turn it down
Girl you know you gotta turn it down
They gon' hear you outside, they gon' hear you outside
They gon' hear you outside, so girl you know you gotta turn it down
Gotta turn down, you know you gotta turn down
They gon', they gon' hear you outside

[Verse 2]
My ex bitch tryna sabotage me
But I'm smart, Dexter's Laboratory
This is not a story
I am telling you what I been going through, I think
If we gon' play, I'ma have to put another pillow on your face
I don't know if you be tryna ride that wave
But you gotta keep it down 'cause my partner's in the other room
Ah, cry now
Don't, don't, cry now
Ooh, try now
Try to keep it down, try to keep it down
Try to keep it down, they gon' hear you outside
They gon', they gon' hear you outside

[Chorus]
Girl you know you gotta turn it down
Girl you know you gotta tone down
Girl you know you gotta turn it down
Girl you know you gotta turn it down
They gon' hear you outside, they gon' hear you outside
They gon' hear you outside, so girl you know you gotta turn it down
Gotta turn down, you know you gotta turn down
They gon', they gon' hear you outside
