[Verse:]
First off fuck your homies and the clique you claim
Real west side nigga, come equipped with game
You claim you fuck with Caleb but he fucked your wife
We bust on Rich Homies niggas duck for life
Ya'll ducks for life, ya'll gone duck for life
Can't believe ya'll niggas had the guts to try
But, uhh, no apologies, I beat the beat up like Apollo Creed
Uh I don't need none of that shit
Huh, none of you niggas with none of that shit
Nigga play with me then we comin' back quick
Pull up, top seater, chopper, people come quick

Your momma still stay over there by greenbriar
Yeah, Draeden want the beef but I guess you dead
Boy you know they comin' for that shit you said
Fuckin' with a youngin' with a fam full of takers
Now you bout to feel the wrath of your maker

Everybody got they time on the feature though

Uh, Shoutout to Future though, you been stealin' that
And they shootin' about Skooly

On the hill where ain't nothing but fam be hangin'
Naan nigga in my family bangin'
