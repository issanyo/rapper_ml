All you gotta do is have faith, glad my niggas ain't never lost faith yeah

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
I paid my dues
Nigga don't play, you'll lose
You probably couldn't walk a mile in 'em
Nigga do you know how much I paid for these shoes?
Yeah, I was raised in the zoo, a nigga never played by the rules
Some niggas tried to play me back in high school yeah
I fucked around and made the news
I never been a sucka, she suck me so good that I think I love her
These niggas injured, they gon' need to recover
You can come over but you can not sleep over
Please bring a friend I do not eat leftovers
We got that clean and she stepped over
Fuck your opinion, I knew I would get it
I promise that hip-hop is not over
See I do not live in no mansion
But I'm 'bout my green like I'm Stanley
See I am so up, I'ma need a xanny
You gotta be hood just to understand me
My trunk in the hood if you understand me
These niggas ain't good if you understand me
I came from the bottom, I could've got shot up, I still can't believe that I'm still standin' yeah
I got on Cuban links, this a Volare and this a mink
Look like a polar bear huggin' me
Girl get on top and make love to me
Love me forever, don't ever get tired of me
Why the fuck would you lie to me?
If I told you I got you, I got you believe me don't let your faith die on me girl

[Hook: YFN Lucci & Skooly]

I wonder why the sun don't shine everyday yeah yeah
I say I wonder why, I say I wonder why, yeah yeah
I wonder why some of these niggas be fake yeah
All you gotta do is have faith,glad my niggas ain't never lost faith yeah yeah
None of my niggas ain't never lost faith
I wonder why, look
Another nigga bitch on the drink
Diamonds drippin' on me like a sink
Fuck what another nigga think

[Verse 2: Skooly]
Look, I'm bout to take em to school, huh
Teach 'em to break all the rules, huh

Them niggas ain't cool, them niggas is fu, they fu
I do not mean to be rude, fuck with me Lucci, huh
See a fuck nigga shoot a fuck nigga, um, tell me who shootin'

I'm with YFN and all of them niggas be shootin', don't get yo shit ruined
Might take a trip to the ruins, my bitch is bad and you knew it
My car is sad and it's blue, look what the money done blew in
Niggas that thinking they foolin' us, there will be funerals for all that snitchin' lil homie
I really be dealin' with bangas, the nellas, the 60s, the Pirus and Crips, lil' homie
How could you trip lil' homie?

Me and Lucci might get you wacked for a job
Welcome to the mob
