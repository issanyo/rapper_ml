[Intro: Skooly]
I'll beat it, yeah show me some'
Let me hold your tongue

[Pre-Chorus: Skooly]
Slow down, let me show you some'
Come and show me some'
I'll beat it, like you stole it
Like you owe me some'
Let me hold your tongue
Like you told me some', like you told me some'

[Chorus: Skooly]
Let me start by sayin' take off them pants
And I can't help it, I've been watchin' your stance
I been watchin' your stance
You can really fuck how you dance
You know how to fuck a nigga just like you dance
I'm talkin' just like you dance, just like you dance
You know how to fuck a nigga just like you dance
I'm talkin' just like you dance, usin' no hands
Fuck a nigga just like you dance
Just like you dance, just like you dance
You know how to fuck a nigga just like you dance
I mean just like you dance

[Verse: Kollision]
That's that type of bitch that let me slide her out
Let me spit all in her mouth and let me choke her out
When your legs get to shakin' when I'm in her spot
Give her Adderall, dick gon' focus, I get energized
She know that I'm groovy, I'm groovy
All we do is fuck and we make movies
Girl, when you on top, you make that dick stand up, lieutenant
Grippin' on your ass while I'm suckin' on your titties
I can't help but to commend it

[Chorus: Skooly]
You can really fuck how you dance
You know how to fuck a nigga just like you dance
I'm talkin' just like you dance, just like you dance
You know how to fuck a nigga just like you dance
I'm talkin' just like you dance, usin' no hands
Fuck a nigga just like you dance
Just like you dance, just like you dance
You know how to fuck a nigga just like you dance
I mean just like you dance
