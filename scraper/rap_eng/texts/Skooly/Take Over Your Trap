[Intro: Bankroll Fresh]
I buy what I want to buy nigga
We supply who buy

[Hook: Bankroll Fresh]
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Grams, trapping
Yams, trapping
Bags, trapping
Hands, trapping
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap

[Verse 1: Bankroll Fresh]
Walked in your trap, spent a fifty
All of my whips got a fifty
My carbon let you out at fifty
Fifties on fifties on fifties
L250 and [?]
Pull up to the plays, I’m inching
You want a bale, then give me the scale
I thumb through the money the quickest
Meet me at the Flying Biscuit’s
Park straight, not crooked
I heard these fuck niggas snitching
I know these pussy niggas bitching
Walk in your trap, fuck you and your strap
If if want this shit I’ma get it
Pussy nigga talking beef
Pussy nigga you know I got it wit me

[Hook: Bankroll Fresh]
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Grams, trapping
Yams, trapping
Bags, trapping
Hands, trapping
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap

[Verse 2: Skooly]
Walk in your trap and take over
I got this shit from my brother
He get this shit from the soda
I put this shit in my motor
Walk in your trap with a killer
He want this shit from the dealer
He want the shit out the back
He want the shit out the middle
He want the pack out the back
He want the racks out the mat
He want the crack out [?]
He put the strap to your back
Dope game teaching fifty ways to get paid
I got J’s serving J’s, that’s that yay serving yay

[Hook: Bankroll Fresh]
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Grams, trapping
Yams, trapping
Bags, trapping
Hands, trapping
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Walk in your trap and take over
Maison Margiela on sofas
I graduated from the dope game
Residue on my diploma
I got that pack on me, don’t I?
I got them racks on me, don’t I?
I got them tabs on me, don’t I?
Barely got room for her number
Barely got room for another whip
All of your niggas is counterfeit
All of my niggas are with the shit
All of my niggas is killers
All of your niggas is witnesses, I’m making plays
I said I’m making plays, I’m serving J’s
Rocking my J’s, you a beginner
You a pretender
You wasn’t with us when we in the trenches
When we in the slums, when we in the ghetto
If I trade in the Maybach, I could get twenty Camaro’s
I’m counting dinero, all black apparel
I fuck on the bitch, nigga keep on the stilettos
Walk in the trap and take over the shit
Walk in the trap and take over that bitch

[Hook: Bankroll Fresh]
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Grams, trapping
Yams, trapping
Bags, trapping
Hands, trapping
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
