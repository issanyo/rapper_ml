Now baby I’m so for real
(I need you more than most tonight)
Baby I’m so for real

Now baby I’m so for real
(I need you more than most tonight)

[Bridge: Skool Boy]
I want you to talk like you love me
And walk like you fuck me
All night till’ we can’t go no more
I want you to look like you miss me
Won’t you come kiss me
Like the first time, oh, like the first time
I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right

[Verse 1: Skool Boy]
I been fucking with the stars lately
I been interested in cars lately
So shit I got to clean out the garage later
Shhh now we can fuck in the garage baby
Tell me when you rolling up
Tell me where it’s going down
I’m definitely showing up
Hope that you be around when I be blowing up
You strong enough I’m strong enough
You know what’s up I know what’s up

[Verse 2: Kaelub]
I N double E D U FrFr
More breakage all over your face
Yeah that’s that CPR
Sitting at the crib sexually frustrated lonely
Looking for that special person
Yeah that one and only
Who be bossing and stay fly
And she stay on her shit
She don’t spill the beans naw
Nothing like a messy bitch
She act like a woman and she think like a man
She want, but naw she don’t need no man
Let’s get acquainted girl
Tonight you on my menu girl
