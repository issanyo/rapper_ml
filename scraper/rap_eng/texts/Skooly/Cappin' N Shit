[Intro: Skooly]
Yeah, woah, yeah, yeah
I'm overlapping this shit
Costa Nostra
The don nigga
M-m-m-murda

[Chorus: Skooly]
Couldn't be getting no money, stop all that cappin' and shit
Show you boys how to get money, it's different brackets to this
Look at my Balmain zippers, check out my jackets and shit
Pimpin' immaculate bitch, back at the lab with this shit

[Verse 1: Skooly]
Back to the trap with this shit, back to the trap with a brick
Heard they sleepin' on me no pillow
They takin' naps in this bitch
Sleep on the block, we on the block, you know we tweak on the block
It ain't no problem, we come from the bottom
You know we sleep on the top (woah)
My brother took a lil' L, he put the re with the rock
I put the lean in the pop, can't tell your knees suck (hah)
I make it rain on the floor, might just need you a mop
Word to my wrist I come from the shitty I promise to shine I'mma glisten
Show 'em my ass, 200 my dash, someone been racin' the engine
I come with a case of them bitches
They know I'm dog, I'm not kitten
I whip up that cut like a pigeon
They told 'em to stay in the kitchen

[Chorus: Skooly]
Couldn't be getting no money, stop all that cappin' and shit
Show you boys how to get money, it's different brackets to this
Look at my Balmain zippers, check out my jackets and shit
Pimpin' immaculate bitch, back at the lab with this shit

[Verse: 2 Chainz]
Back in the back of the Bach
Back to the lab with the yam
For dinner, I gave her a Percocet, for breakfast I gave her a Xan
I used to want a trans-am I used to want a Camaro
Puerto Rican Johnny had the birds
I kept my eyes on the sparrow
You keep your eyes on the barrel
I keep it aimed right at you
I throw the pain right at you, I throw a chain right at you
Walk into the strip club bitch and I throw some rain right at ya
Treat the trap just like a old man
And I throw some cane right at ya
I throw some weed right at ya
I throw some lean right at ya
I throw some 'preme right at ya
See I fuck Celin√© right at ya
Forgive me, Lord, I ain't seen the pastor
I smoke the tree the fastest
I get the cheese the fastest

[Chorus: Skooly]
Couldn't be getting no money, stop all that cappin' and shit
Show you boys how to get money, it's different brackets to this
Look at my Balmain zippers, check out my jackets and shit
Pimpin' immaculate bitch, back at the lab with this shit
