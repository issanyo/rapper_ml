[Intro]
I was brought up, you know like
We was very family orientated, it was crazy
So I don't know nothin' but family, you dig

[Verse 1]
Ten twenty in the morning woke up from a phone ring
Threw that bitch across the room 'cause I don't fuckin' want it
Still feelin' like somethin' wrong, my mom ain't fuckin' yawnin'
So I went inside her room to try to check up on her (mama)
She hangin' off the bed, leg off the bed
She done took a xan, she been up all fuckin' mornin'
Too be honest last night was kinda fuckin' blurry
Girl you had me worried (girl you had me worried)
I woke up in my skinny jeans, silly me
Racks bustin' out my pockets, some in the sheets
Wallet hanging out my pocket, down by my feet
What was in that weed, damn what the fuck I drink?
What the fuck I did last night to get this check?
I don't remember a damn thing, I'm tryna recollect
Think I went somewhere with Chainz, he got me making change
Sippin' lean until I'm burpin', Maybach had the curtain

[Chorus]
Clean as some damn detergent like I'm fuckin' serving
I'ma fuck her if she worth it, too far from a virgin
I done popped another perky, think them bitches working
Fucked her while I'm sippin' syrup, think she tasting purple
Cookies inside of my blunt, I bought a pound this month
Serving rappers, they like damn how you found this much?
That nigga there, that nigga round where you fuckin' found him
Every show, walk through the door, I give my mom allowance
But when I'm walkin' out the house I see that lady frowning
She don't wanna see me gone (but I can't blame her 'bout it)

[Verse 2]
The streets tough and we up, I see these niggas' bluff
I can't give a nigga nothin', no I can't give it up
Watch I go and get a million, watch I split it up
Watch I break that champagne down, fill the cups
All my niggas in the building, watch us live it up
Still got semis tucked, but this a Bentley truck now
I done really struck now, I done leveled up now
I'm a stand up guy, I could never duck down
Ain't no giving up now, I could never back down
Better get your fuckin' child, all these fuckin' mad clowns
XXL, how? and your bars trash
They don't respect a nigga now, I'ma get all y'all ass
This is dodgeball yeah, can you dodge ball
I'ma start a call log i ain't sparing none of y'all ass
He the hardest nigga out, I got to start it off
I'm one of the hardest, that's regardless
I put you niggas on this game and I could take you off
Don't make me mad and get me started, it get harsh
He the hardest nigga out, I got to start it off (facts)
I'm one of the hardest, that's regardless (big old, big old facts)
I put you niggas on this game and I could take you off
Don't make me mad and get me started, it get harsh

[Chorus]
Clean as some damn detergent like I'm fuckin' serving
I'ma fuck her if she worth it, too far from a virgin
I done popped another perky, think them bitches working
Fucked her while I'm sippin' syrup, think she tasting purple
Cookies inside of my blunt, I bought a pound this month
Serving rappers, they like damn how you found this much?
That nigga there, that nigga round where you fuckin' found him
Every show, walk through the door, I give my mom allowance
But when I'm walkin' out the house I see that lady frowning
She don't wanna see me gone
