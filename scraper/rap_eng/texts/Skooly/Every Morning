[Hook: Young Thug]
Me and Skooly count a lot of racks
Me and Skooly fuck a lot of nats
Nigga know young Skooly my woadie
AP apology, now hold up the rollie
I wake up and do the same thing every morning
Every morning, every morning, every morning
I wake up and do the same thing every morning
Same thing every morning, every morning, every morning

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I'm Dr. Phil, wake up and pour 4's and pop pills
You know that it's real
Wake up and I’m on that MTV ‘there, look baby!’ show her just how I live
I don't apologize with all these racks I spend on time
I don’t apologize if ever getting racks was ever a crime
Pull up in a hoodie, no coat
Shoot you in the hoodie, no coat
Pull that .45 no colt
Slit a nigga throat, watch him sink no boat
No I'm not a spoke, get you killed no spoke
Oops I meant speaking, I’m sliming like deacons
See nigga’s riding for no reason
All of them tattoos look cheesy y'know what I’m saying?
I'm the man yes I am, I'm the man with the plans
Yes ma'am, I'm the man on the beach
I'm the man with the sand, I got these freaks
Diving on me, climbing on me, vagina's on me
No beard, Yo Skooly get these hoes up off me with the .40

[Hook: Young Thug + Skooly]
Me and Skooly count a lot of racks
Me and Skooly fuck a lot of nats
Nigga know young Skooly my woadie
AP apology, now hold up the rolie
Lil Jeff, these niggass rapping and singing again (Woo)
It's just me and my friends
They caught us trapping and leaning again
CCU, YSL they fiendin again

[Verse 2: Skooly]
Pocket full of money but my bitch doing better (Woo, Ah)
The bitch bust chest, so she gotta eat checkers (WOO, AH)
Got an old rolex and a brand new bezel (WOO, Ah)
See the bitch got flooded but the mob couldn't help
Thugger to the right, Skooly ride to the left
We don't like snitches, keep the cops to yourself
YSL on my feet, cheetah spots on my belt
All the money on me a nigga might need help
Plus I'm the illest, and realest young nigga you seen
I take off and pull up on thugger
My niggas not really feeling the scene
We rather go count up a hunna'
Them bitches not really feeling your team
They rather go fuck on my brothers
You better not let your bitch get in between
Cause me and Young Thugger gon' fuck her
We turning her up, we bendin' her over, she suck like a sucker
We breaking her back, then sending her back, you take care of her
You stupid
