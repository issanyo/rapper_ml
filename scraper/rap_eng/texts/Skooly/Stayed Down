[Verse 1]
I should get way more
Dis shit should pay more (yes it should)
I broke some shit that I couldn't afford to pay for
Shit you brake it you pay for it
Did a lot of shii I ain't proud of
Now a nigga pay for it
I cannot say more but my roof is insane
The coop got no brains the roof will go bang
Ha shoot anything that oppose to this shit
Young nigga trying to stay focus and shit
Hang on you pussy niggas
Give me some rope for this shit
Take off you pussy niggas
Leaving you broke in this bitch

[Verse 2]
Yea yea that shit irrelevant
This money get hell a spent
Fuck you doing my bitch so intelligent
She got a resident furniture elegant living
Like Hue Hefna give me a robe a pipe
Give me some hoes that bite
Please  don’t get froze tonight
You will get exposed tonight
We nigga camping take off with swagger
How could this happen this a disaster
This nigga tragic go get the platinum
Homie if I take you off
Promise you will never know
My brother stuck behind the wall
Together they never told
Lean and peal is all I ever sold
Just that I never sold
Stuck in the one time
Fucking with several hoes
Smoke to my weed I sell it
Curcus a lean etc fuck do you mean I sell
You cannot be in my section
I don’t need direction
You just know where to go
He just know where to look
Ha you better let it go
Huh ain’t nothing but a crook

[Verse 3]
Back to the mother fucking basics
I’m back lying bitch favorite
Ya’ll nigga better gone crazy
Gonners in the back and they lay
Skater on an ice gone crazy
Strong ass pack about a pound when we blazing
When we blazing bubble gum cooking nigga
My life is so enticing bitch
It’s priceless when I move
You don’t fight for what you want
Then don’t cry for what you lose

[Verse 4]
Stay stay down stay stay down
Stay stay down stay stay down
My momma stay down my momma stay down
Yea stay stay down stay stay down
You ain’t real real if you ain’t stayed down
You ain’t real real if you ain’t stayed down
My homies stay down my momma stayed down
You ain’t real real if you ain’t stayed down
