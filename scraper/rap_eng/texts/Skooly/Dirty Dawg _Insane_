[Intro]
I done did this shit like a hundred times, that's crazy
Mmm, Gotti, hand me that cup
Bro ain't pulled up with the weed yet?
Buddah blessed this beat

[Chorus]
Shit, okay before the fame I knew that I was insane bitch
Dirty dawg, they tell me I'm so untamed bitch
Clean dawg, I ain't got no fuckin' mange bitch
Single y'all, I ain't got no fuckin' main bitch
I got whip appeal, show you how to fuckin' lane switch
Make you disappear, I be on some David Blaine shit
On the Richter Scale, you won't weigh the fuckin' same shit
On that Kurt Cobain, I'm still on that Purple Rain shit

[Verse]
I am not the same, he is not the same
I am not ashamed, he ain't got no game
I am not a lame, we don't rock the same
We can't pop the same, he ain't got no stain
I came from a block, I came from the bottom
Didn't come from the top, but I swear I got 'em
This ain't for no nigga, this shit for my mama
This ain't for your niggas, this shit for my partner
Make sure them niggas see, let them bitches breathe
They ain't fucking with me period, I let 'em bleed
Off the Hennessy, she gon' let me see
She don't know exactly what she want, she tellin' me
How to hit a sauna, make them bitches wonder
I'm gon' run up on her, make her feel the thunder
She gon' tell her partner, go get your bitch in order
I put my wrist in water, cop me your bitch, contort her

[Chorus]
Shit, okay before the fame I knew that I was insane bitch
Dirty dawg, they tell me I'm so untamed bitch
Clean dawg, I ain't got no fuckin' mange bitch
Single y'all, I ain't got no fuckin' main bitch
I got whip appeal, show you how to fuckin' lane switch
Make you disappear, I be on some David Blaine shit
On the Richter Scale you won't weigh the fuckin' same shit
On that Kurt Cobain, I'm still on that Purple Rain shit
