[Intro]
(Ear Drummers)
Ooh

[Refrain]
That side on back, yeah
That's right I'm back, yeah, yeah
The boy out the mouth, yeah (ooh)
The boy don't be playin' though, yeah, yeah, yeah
I never really needed nobody (ooh)
I never really needed your sorry (ooh)
But I never wanna see you cry (ooh)
But I never really needed you darling (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
That don't mean a thang
I'll teach you a thang
Bring you the pain
I'll teach you how to sing

[Chorus]
Girl, you kinda special, you go both ways
Girl, you put tension with a dope dick
I be on drugs so it's okay
And you probably gon' turn into a dope fiend
Dope fiend, you probably gon' turn into a dope fiend
You gon' fall in love with a dope fiend
Most of these hoes in the club don't know me
Most of these niggas that they love wanna know me

[Verse]
Fresh outta pain
Fresh out the pain hole
Finna ice out the gang
Iced out my Cartier frames
I be on my Detriot thang
I'll never give you away
So you don't need to be in my lane
Fresh out the pack, I be rackin' up racks
You can stay where you at
Ain't no more cuttin' you slack
'Cause I'll end up lovin' you back
And they don't show love where you at
(It ain't no love) Even with the bag on my back
I done got stabbed in the back
Talkin' 'bout a rapid attack
I'm a savage, tell 'em bring the bad bitch aback

[Refrain]
That side on back, yeah
That's right I'm back, yeah, yeah
The boy out the mouth, yeah (ooh)
The boy don't be playin' though, yeah, yeah, yeah
I never really needed nobody (ooh)
I never really needed your sorry (ooh)
But I never wanna see you cry (ooh)
But I never really needed you darling (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
That don't mean a thang
I'll teach you a thang
Bring you the pain
I'll teach you how to sing

[Chorus]
Girl, you kinda special, you go both ways
Girl, you put tension with a dope dick
I be on drugs so it's okay
And you probably gon' turn into a dope fiend
Dope fiend, you probably gon' turn into a dope fiend
You gon' fall in love with a dope fiend
Most of these hoes in the club don't know me
Most of these niggas that they love wanna know me
