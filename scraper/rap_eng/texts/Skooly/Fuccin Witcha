[Chorus]
Baby I was cool on them other bitches
Baby I was cool on them other bitches
I really wasn't cool with them other niggas
Bitch you lookin' like a fool with them other niggas
Girl I really went to school with them other niggas
And I ain't tryna lose like them other niggas
So you really gotta choose on them other niggas
Is it gonna be school or them other niggas?
And I'm feelin' like a fool, I was fuckin' witcha
Am I fool just for fuckin' witcha?
Shit, girl it's cool, I ain't fuckin' witcha
You ain't gon' catch me on the news 'bout no other nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm so motherfuckin' cool, it's a fuckin' given, huh
Even back in school I wasn't fuckin' trippin'
I got so many bruises on my heart, what the bandages for
But it's cool, let the scars show, I had 'em before, let's go
Ha, what you panicking for?
Yeah you helped me put a sixty in the attic before
Ever since a nigga left you ain't had it no more
I remember when you had it galore, calm down girl
I uptowned and downtowned a town girl
I clear slippered and Gucci'ed down your gown girl
Around girls, at round table with found girls
Still the only nigga that make you smile girl, you know it
Haha, you know it

[Refrain]
Am I fool just for fuckin' witcha?
Shit, girl it's cool, I ain't fuckin' witcha
You ain't gon' catch me on the news 'bout no other nigga
Am I fool just for fuckin' witcha?
Shit, girl it's cool, I ain't fuckin' witcha
You ain't gon' catch me on the news 'bout no other nigga

[Chorus]
Baby I was cool on them other bitches
Baby I was cool on them other bitches
I really wasn't cool with them other niggas
Bitch you lookin' like a fool with them other niggas
Girl I really went to school with them other niggas
And I ain't tryna lose like them other niggas
So you really gotta choose on them other niggas
Is it gonna be school or them other niggas?

[Verse 2]
Fuck her 'til she get her facts straight, actually I'm happy
I'm back bae, yeah bae I'm back bae
Make you act straight with handcuffs and black tape
No actually, slap ass and slap face
When you lap dance I tap dance and act waist
Got a young heart, I got stamina all day
Young boy, I am not tapping out, no way
Make her run for it, I got her handling four things
Run boy, you gotta handle her four ways
Do it in the car, can you handle the road rage?
Do it in the sky, in the back of this full plane
Show me you ain't shy right inside of these full faces
Tell her, no face apparently no case, uh
No waist, apparently no waste, uh
So fake, you lied to my whole face
Hell nah I ain't fuckin' with your ass, bitch

[Refrain]
Feelin' like a fool, I was fuckin' witcha (hah)
Am I fool just for fuckin' witcha? (so fake you lied to my whole face)
Shit, girl it's cool, I ain't fuckin' witcha
You ain't gon' catch me on the news 'bout no other nigga (so, so, so fake you lied to my whole face)
Baby I was cool on them other bitches
Baby I was cool on them other bitches (hell nah I ain't fuckin' with your ass)
I really wasn't cool with them other niggas
Bitch you lookin' like a fool with them other niggas
(so fake you lied to my whole face)

[Chorus]
Baby I was cool on them other bitches
Baby I was cool on them other bitches
I really wasn't cool with them other niggas
Bitch you lookin' like a fool with them other niggas

[Outro]
Ha, what you panicking for?
Yeah you helped me put a sixty in the attic before
Ever since a nigga left you ain't had it no more
I remember when you had it galore
