[Verse 1: Trinidad Jame$]
When you look in the mirror, do you feel like a boss?
When you look at that bitch in your eye, do you feel like a boss?
I gotta lotta bitches on my side, please do not think that you special
I am your father figure, little bitch
Please do not disrespect me, ho
No more niggas in my section, please, extra, extra, extra hoes
No more niggas in my section, please (Extra, extra extra h-)
I taught your baby daddy how to dress, this is not a flex
I taught your favourite rapper how to dress, this is not a flex
The Ferragamo cost a chicken tender, that's a four piece, not a Mrs. Winters
I'm the flyest nigga-nigga walking, Imma need some to contenders
I'm the one to pay the roll, and start the , causing fender benders
You don't shop like I shop, nigga
Never never, I'm in new [?], you just got to Lennox
Trap, Trap hat, shoes, sweater
Call it triple threat
Niggas still tryina be flyer than me, they ain't did it yet
We came a long way up, started in the lobby
Your car know your rent, [?]
All my niggas know [?]
All my bitches know it's semen
Diamond dance like Chris Brown, hallelujah jesus
I know these niggas see me
I know these bitches see me
I know these niggas see me
I know these bitches see me
My crib [?], I gotta make them or believe them
I be flyer than a flag, I ain't tryina brag, hallelujah, jesus
But you need another reason
Cause I make it look so easy
I be flyer every season
Don't make me get conceited

[Verse 2: Skooly]
Don't make me get conceited
Make 'em or believe 'em
I told them I ain't preachin, dressin' like a deacon
Bad bitches, bad bitches, all on the weekend
Ménage à trois, threesome, bad bitches getting freaky
Okay, now tis is not the season
Swagger jagger Steven
Don't need hoes, I got three hoes, in this one Lamborghini
Call me slab dab Jesus
Margiela beanie
Ball man, to all man, to Jeremy Scott wingin'
Got your favourite rapper singing
But I'm not offended
Fuck the politicin'
I'm the one that did it
Bad bitch in Venice, mad grippin [?]
Since I got to Benji's, I don't ever shop at Lennox
