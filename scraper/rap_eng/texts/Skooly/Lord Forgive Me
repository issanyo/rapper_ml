[Intro]
Yeah
Huh, huh
Yeah

[Chorus: Strap or Sheldrick]
Lord you know I'm a sinner
Give no fucks, I don't remember
I remember reading scriptures
I remember law and pistol
Real diamond no crystal
Dollar signs all are mental
Dollar signs all are mental
Dollar signs all are mental
Grindin' hard for my boy
Grind hard for my nigga
We don't work for every nigga
I ain't trust that nigga
Name another nigga realer
Name another nigga realer (yeah)
Name another nigga realer
Name another nigga realer (yeah)

[Verse 1:  Strap or Sheldrick]
I was a star in the mud
Ridin' around with my boy
Ridin' around with a thug
The street that showed me some love
They beefin' at a lil boy
I'm keepin' the heat by my gut
We got us a shooter, so what?
We loadin' up when we boot up
Niggas be actin so tough, I know they bluff
I know you ain't come up rough
Might pour a four in my cup, while I count up
Promise I can't get enough
V-Frame, when the heat change
In the two-seater, watch me switch lanes
We on Biscayne, I don't see lame
Cuban link chain, I don't link chain

[Chorus:  Strap or Sheldrick]
Lord you know I'm a sinner
Give no fucks, I don't remember
I remember reading scriptures
I remember law and pistol
Real diamond no crystal
Dollar signs all are mental
Dollar signs all are mental
Dollar signs all are mental
Grindin' hard for my boy
Grindin' hard my nigga
We don't work for every nigga
I ain't trust that nigga
Name another nigga realer
Name another nigga realer
Name another nigga realer
Name another nigga realer

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Lord forgive me I'm a sinner
Street nigga, good intentions
I remember we was little
I'ma get us out the trenches
I'ma put us all in Benzes
House, brick, lay up fences
Watchin' out for camera lenses
I am really not pretendin'
What I'm rocking you can not afford
Can't even find it in stores
She used to tell me she was bored
I touch her like never before
I rip her, pin her to the floor
I was liftin' dick, what you doin'?
Trynna feel the dick, want more
Need a bigger closet, want more

[Bridge: Kevin Gates]
These niggas ain't got no heart
These niggas ain't got no heart
These niggas ain't got no heart
They ain't bout goin' to war
These niggas ain't got no heart
These niggas ain't got no heart
These niggas ain't got no heart
They ain't bout goin' to war

[Chorus:  Strap or Sheldrick]
Lord you know I'm a sinner
Give no fucks, I don't remember
I remember reading scriptures
I remember law and pistol
Real diamond no crystal
Dollar signs all are mental
Dollar signs all are mental
Dollar signs all are mental

[Verse 3: Skooly]
Grindin' hard for my mamma
Grindin' hard for my boys
2 chains and my big dog
T.R.U. is my squad
Couple nigga's drop somethin'
They got hate and they hard
Niggas said I fall off
Like I'm losin' my voice
I never talk around hoes
I'ma go get me a horse
I'ma go get me a Porsche
Make it make all the noise
Engine make all the noise
Engine gon' always roar
I remember tall bitches thought I was a boy
Not anymore

[Chorus:  Strap or Sheldrick]
Lord you know I'm a sinner
Give no fucks, I don't remember
I remember reading scriptures
I remember law and pistol
Real diamond no crystal
Dollar signs all are mental
Dollar signs all are mental
Dollar signs all are mental
Grindin' hard for my boy
Grindin' hard my nigga
We don't work for every nigga
I ain't trust that nigga
Name another nigga realer
Name another nigga realer
Name another nigga realer
Name another nigga realer
