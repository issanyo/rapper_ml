Hook:
-Skooly-
Back Against The Wall Again, I Done Lost All My Friends
I Deserve All I Get , Had A Low Tolerance
You Ain't Even Started With Him , I Ain't Even Start With Dem
They Ain't Going All Way In, Me Brodie Hard As Them

-Yung D.i.-
Young N***a Risking It All , Never Go Out Back
Still Counting These Racks Up, Young N***a Need All The Bags
The N***as Be Flaw as F*** , No Love He A Dead Man
Put Them Racks On The Shelf , Got Skate To The Left
We Tight Like A Headband

Skooly Verse:

If It Ain't Yo Fam People, Them Ain't Yo Damn People/
Life Ain't Damn Equal , The Summer Can't Guarantee Ya/
If It Ain't Yo Fam People, Them Ain't Yo Damn People/
Life Ain't Damn Equal , The Summer Can't Guarantee Ya/
Shawty Got The Girls Gone Wild, Shawty Got The Girls On File/
N***a Gone Crack Yo Crown , Westside Back In Style/
Gone And Wake Em Up , I Need Em All Awake/
They Done Did A Crime , Its Gone Be Hard To Pay/
Shawty Got That Dope That Make Em Harlem Shake/
We Gone Do This S**t Right Here For Harder Days/

Yung D.i. Verse:
Back against the wall but my feet on pavement , the love the be fakest, Im use to hating /
I Got cross few times I been going thru some phases , but skate that’s my brother He Blue Like Navy /
I didn’t make the draft , a few partner start trading ,got rich off Of rap , in booth going crazy /
Real partners stay down like they stuck in ah stasis 
You stay down with me We gone come out the greatest/
I was just broke I mean literally broke , but I stuck to The code ,We had to many goals /
They couldn’t lend Me A had when I need it the most 
Like they want me fail Or come sale out my soul /
But I’m not gone do neither , we westside to death talking Simpson cedar/
Drop dope on verses sell it like it was legal, my h** broke the code off the top I’m leave ha , heart cold like a freeze/
I don’t hold grudges but I can’t respect it , these n***as be scared , I’m first to address it /
They know not to play boy I’m lethal no weapon 
I know they regret  it, got rings like a wedding /
Back against the wall i prevail every time , fake love had blind me so ears was my eyes /
How could I trust you if You switching sides , dead man tell no lies/
