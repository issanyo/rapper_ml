[Intro: Lil Duke & Skooly]
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh
To let you know you my girl, uh-hu

[Chorus: Lil Duke & Skooly]
And I don’t know what it takes to let you know you my girl
And I don’t know what it is, she wanna live in my world
'Cause that bitch know she my baby
Can’t let no fuck nigga play me
Gave her the dick, she went crazy
I got in the booth and it saved me
All these lights and cameras (flash), this shit really ain’t what it seems
Porsche Panameras, hop out red bottom when I’m on the scene
Niggas be moving so funny I’m riding with my niggas, we ride with them sticks
None of my niggas no playin', you get out of line and your ass gon' get hit

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
Bet you gon' send in the blitz (go get 'em)
Bitches so bad getting switched
Young nigga banging that six
They know that I’m with the shits
Can't go out like Rico did Mitch
Can't put my trust in no bitch
I just been stacking and praying
All of my bitches they slaying
Only the real, they know what I’m saying
Had to get off my ass, I made a plan
Blow that money like a fan
Fucking on all kind of fans
And I been up like I need me a xan
They know that I'ma stand out like a tan
And I'ma keep me a drum like a band
If I can't catch him, I knock off his mans
Dick in your mouth and it’s fuck what you saying
Pulling up, hoping out vans and we spraying
She kept it real from the start
My lil bitch, yeah she got heart
I know she goin’ play her part
And for that she got my heart, on God

[Chorus: Lil Duke & Skooly]
And I don’t know what it takes to let you know you my girl
And I don’t know what it is, she wanna live in my world
'Cause that bitch know she my baby
Can’t let no fuck nigga play me
Gave her the dick, she went crazy
I got in the booth and it saved me
All these lights and cameras (flash), this shit really ain’t what it seems
Porsche Panameras, hop out red bottom when I’m on the scene
Niggas be moving so funny I’m riding with my niggas, we ride with them sticks
None of my niggas no playin', you get out of line and your ass gon' get hit

[Verse 2: Skooly]
If you only knew girl, we were meant to be together
Oooh, we were meant to be together
Hop in this car with me (come on)
Little bitch don’t start with me (come on)
You got to come with me
You got to come for me
Keep goddamn calling me (keep callin')
You goin’ keep on stalling me (you keep on stallin')
Get it on in the car with me (get it on in the car)
Get it on in the stall with me (get it on the stall)
Get it on in the mall with me (all in the mall)
You ain’t got no stamina
Get it on on the camera, I'll do damages
I ain’t goin’ keep playing with you
No, ain’t no amateur
This shit ain’t average
I'ma fuck your panties up
If your parents up, I hope your parents up
My pistol on the stool, I think your parents home

[Chorus: Lil Duke & Skooly]
And I don’t know what it takes to let you know you my girl
And I don’t know what it is, she wanna live in my world
'Cause that bitch know she my baby
Can’t let no fuck nigga play me
Gave her the dick, she went crazy
I got in the booth and it saved me
All these lights and cameras (flash), this shit really ain’t what it seems
Porsche Panameras, hop out red bottom when I’m on the scene
Niggas be moving so funny I’m riding with my niggas, we ride with them sticks
None of my niggas no playin', you get out of line and your ass gon' get hit
