[Intro]
Don't know what to do with you
I get my own

[Chorus]
Sorry I ain't basic
I guess they didn't want me to make it
Okay lil shawty wanna rape me
I guess I gotta let her take it
She say she wanna have my baby
I ain't doin' nothin' crazy
I can't ever let a bitch play me
Becomin' that bitch slave

[Verse 1]
Okay, eat the man baby, Peter Pan baby, he the man
Tryna get a pound of reefer from A-reefer-stan
Don't listen to 'em, don't you listen what them people said
And my pockets full of Franklins like Aretha dead
Simon said DJ Khaled, that means we the best
My diamonds said that I'm poppin' like my regal red
Long as you livin' give a fuck about 'em, leave 'em dead
And I can't argue with you if you ain't got equal bread
My teacher said you gon' be somethin' if your mind fed
But nowadays got them bitches on they hind legs
And all them niggas that was hatin' on me dyin', dead
I'm just tryna keep this money on my mindset

[Chorus]
Sorry I ain't basic
I guess they didn't want me to make it
Okay lil shawty wanna rape me
I guess I gotta let her take it
She say she wanna have my baby
I ain't doin' nothin' crazy
I can't ever let a bitch play me
Becomin' that bitch slave

[Verse 2]
Now bitches callin', niggas callin', need another phone
I stack it up and rack it up, bought mom another home
I fuck with niggas, fuck them niggas that done done me wrong
That's I wonder why we never did another song (I wonder why)
I wonder why, but I ain't gon' dwell on bullshit
My brother got out on that bullshit
These niggas is soft as pudding
These niggas don't know what the hood is
And I'm 'bout to go on a tour bitch
Still got a full clip, I'm on that I wish you would shit
Wish you would shit, but this ain't no--
Now we not no clowns, uh uh, we from the town, uh uh
I got more rounds, uh uh, they finna talk, uh uh
Don't make 'em clown, uh uh, it goin' down

[Chorus]
Sorry I ain't basic
I guess they didn't want me to make it
Okay lil shawty wanna rape me
I guess I gotta let her take it
She say she wanna have my baby
I ain't doin' nothin' crazy
I can't ever let a bitch play me
Becomin' that bitch slave

[Outro]
Don't know what to do with you
Don't know what to
Don't know what to do with you
Damn, but I ain't gon' dwell on bullshit
My brother got out on that bullshit
These niggas is soft as pudding
These niggas don't know what the hood is
And I'm 'bout to go on a tour bitch
Still got a full clip, I'm on that I wish you would shit
