[Intro: Skooly]
Yeah, I mean, like
I'm on some whole other shit
Like, I'm on some got money shit and I'm on some get money shit
Like, you wouldn't understand, like...

[Verse 1: Skooly]
You talking 'bout money
This is my area
Niggas ain't scaring us
I am not fearing nothing but the man in the mirror
I can not make it no clearer
Niggas not taking me serious
Can't take these lil niggas serious
Woo!
Hop out that Panamera
Check my apparel
Look like I got on a bear
This mink I got on is rare
This shit I kick isn't fair
This month I did the Giuseppe
That life our numbers a pair
I like my woman superb
She on her shit and she work
Long as she willing to work
Don't give a damn where she work
I don't give a damn what you worth
I think I'm better than you
I know I'm better than you
So I can not settle for two
So look I'm gonna settle the truth
This what I'm telling to you
These niggas done took our swag and went through the
Roof
Tell me what I'm 'pose to do
I promise that I am not basic
I wish these niggas stop faking and face it
Yeah, they turning they backs on me
They scared to face me
Ain't that crazy
