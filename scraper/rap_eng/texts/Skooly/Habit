[Chorus: Skooly]
Look, walked in looking like it, crooked pockets
And I'm higher than a satellite, the kush exotic, look
Be careful where that cash at, them niggas lurking
Spent my last on a bad bitch, it's all worth it
Goddamn I'm a savage, goddamn
Goddamn forty plastic, goddamn
Hunt down on a bad bitch, goddamn
Goddamn it's a habit, I gotta have it

[Verse 1: Skooly]
Goddamn it's a habit, to have it
Know I gotta have a bad bitch, nasty
I do shit to make her mad and just sayin' shit
She took my lean out the cabinet, I'm mad as shit
She took my weed and popped my xans and shit, a savage bitch
I'm on codeine, I do it randomly, for allergies
About the cream, I'm going to handle it, I handle shit
Knock 'em down until they can't touch, that Hammer shit

[Chorus: Skooly]
Look, walked in looking like it, crooked pockets
And I'm higher than a satellite, the kush exotic, look
Be careful where that cash at, them niggas lurking
Spent my last on a bad bitch, it's all worth it
Goddamn I'm a savage, goddamn
Goddamn forty plastic, goddamn
Hunt down on a bad bitch, goddamn
Goddamn it's a habit, I gotta have it

[Verse 2: Skooly]
A couple hoes wanna know me now, I am the shit
Couple hoes wanna blow me out, that candle shit
Broke nigga looking thirsty, can't handle it
Now these hoes wanna alert me, that AMBER shit
Roll a Duport deuce right inside my Fanta bitch
I ain't stupid but I'm ruthless, think I need an analyst
I'm a fucking animal, where the fucking camera bitch?
Gucci sock, Gucci shirt, but these some Louis sandals bitch

[Chorus: Skooly]
Look, walked in looking like it, crooked pockets
And I'm higher than a satellite, the kush exotic, look
Be careful where that cash at, them niggas lurking
Spent my last on a bad bitch, it's all worth it
Goddamn I'm a savage, goddamn
Goddamn forty plastic, goddamn
Hunt down on a bad bitch, goddamn
Goddamn it's a habit, I gotta have it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
All these rings on my finger shining, like a grilly
Last night I screamed free Meek and popped a wheelie
Everybody want a bankroll, so where the cash at?
Rest in peace Bankroll, I had a flashback
All I want is a baddie, send the addy
Then I fucked her wearing a turtleneck, like a rabbit
Got a bee on my jean jacket, I'm talking fashion
And I swerve in anybody's lane, like a taxi

[Chorus: Skooly]
Look, walked in looking like it, crooked pockets
And I'm higher than a satellite, the kush exotic, look
Be careful where that cash at, them niggas lurking
Spent my last on a bad bitch, it's all worth it
Goddamn I'm a savage, goddamn
Goddamn forty plastic, goddamn
Hunt down on a bad bitch, goddamn
Goddamn it's a habit, I gotta have it
