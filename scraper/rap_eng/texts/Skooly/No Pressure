[Intro: Derez De'Shon]
Ain't no pressure on
Ain't no pressure on
Ain't no pressure on

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin, Derez De'Shon & Skooly]
Dropped thirty on them sixes, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on me)
Tricking on these bitches, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on me)
Don't worry about my riches, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on)
Flexing on these stank hoes (ain't no pressure on)
Standing on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on)
It ain't no pressure on my bankroll
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on, no pressure on (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
Stunting on these stank hoes, no pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no pressure on me)

[Verse 1: Skooly]
Ain't no pressure on my bankroll, the pipe broke, fella, you playing
I get higher than a kite, little fella
All we want is cheese, get your slice on fella (get rained on, y'all)
You should try an umbrella
Pressure, you must really got that popcorn bread
Make me wrap them in the racks and put some knots on your head
Low tops and stretchy socks, my Vans on high
With all due respect, bitch, I let them bands fly

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin, Derez De'Shon & Skooly]
Dropped thirty on them sixes, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on me)
Tricking on these bitches, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on me)
Don't worry about my riches, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on)
Flexing on these stank hoes (ain't no pressure on)
Standing on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on)
It ain't no pressure on my bankroll
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on, no pressure on (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
Stunting on these stank hoes, no pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no pressure on me)

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
This drop top ain't no hot box
Ain't no pressure when I ball, fuck the shot clock
No blocked shots
Pressure building up, look like he 'bout to blow
He threw some ones, I threw some ones, but he ain't got no more
We ordered Papa John's, I mean Pappadeaux
That's one bad bitch, I got a lot of those
Truey jeans galore, I got a lot of clothes
Ear, neck, wrist, whole body froze

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin, Derez De'Shon & Skooly]
Dropped thirty on them sixes, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on me)
Tricking on these bitches, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on me)
Don't worry about my riches, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on)
Flexing on these stank hoes (ain't no pressure on)
Standing on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on)
It ain't no pressure on my bankroll
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on, no pressure on (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
Stunting on these stank hoes, no pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no pressure on me)

[Verse 3: RK Kaelub]
Who got pressure on Kaelub? (Not Rich Kidz)
[?] like we some Taylors
Ay, you can keep the white, but my niggas smoking vapors
Bring out the money machine, ain't no touching that paper
We getting money here, my radar never see haters
These niggas tripping, choosing pussy over paper
I'm so close to the money, feel like Ben Frank's neighbor
And I'll cover all y'all like Allstate
And I ain't ringing like a trap bell [?]

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin, Derez De'Shon & Skooly]
Dropped thirty on them sixes, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on me)
Tricking on these bitches, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on me)
Don't worry about my riches, ain't no pressure on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on)
Flexing on these stank hoes (ain't no pressure on)
Standing on my bankroll (ain't no pressure on)
It ain't no pressure on my bankroll
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on, no pressure on (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
No pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no)
Stunting on these stank hoes, no pressure on my bankroll (it ain't no pressure on me)
