[Chorus: Skooly]
Gotta keep her, pound of reefer
I get it, I drive a forin feature
She conceited, damb diva
She ain't perfect, she just got some forin features
Wearin shoes, not adidas
Move the work, nice to meet you
Hard to reach you, jump in the Beatle
Protect my body from the thotties, quiet, a secret

[Verse 1: Skooly]
Not tryna start with nobody, that rocket goin guard my body
Young niggas in charge, don't start
Start no problem
Westside nigga, that's my nigga
Krip, yeah nigga
Superhero niggas, Deadshot killer
Headshot killer, wrist up, nigga
Deadstar bullits, this cop killer

[Chorus: Skooly]
Gotta keep her, pound of reefer
I get it, I drive a forin feature
She conceited, damb diva
She ain't perfect, she just got some forin features
Wearin shoes, not adidas
Move the work, nice to meet you
Hard to reach you, jump in the Beatle
Protect my body from the thotties, quiet, a secret

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
You gotta believe it, just keep it a secret
You wanna a verse, I gotta tax, he want a feature
Never sat in the bleachers, 808 in my speakers
She ate my dick, she said she don't eat meat, said she a vegan
Got her to suck on my dick, bitch, I'm on the milage, and I'm geeked
Not from the Chi, but you tweekin
Look at my racks, they increasing
Bitch, I'm with Skooly, and I'm toatin the tooli
Ride with the Rolli, young nigga, and I'm ruthlis
She suck the dick like she toothless

[Chorus: Skooly]
Gotta keep her, pound of reefer
I get it, I drive a forin feature
She conceited, damb diva
She ain't perfect, she just got some forin features
Wearin shoes, not adidas
Move the work, nice to meet you
Hard to reach you, jump in the Beatle
Protect my body from the thotties, quiet, a secret

[Verse 3: Young Marley]
I'm doin this shit on the daily, cause I gettin these cheques and that paper
Designer, draped in the latest, fuckin these hoes, ain't no way I can save her
Never drippin, too much of a player
To be cuffin these hoes, loving these hoes, trustin these hoes, purpin these hoes
In love with the paper, you know how it goes
Different type of planet, bitch
Bankrolls, pockets kinda crookid
Super head, she the sickest
You know that I'm street, straight out of the trentches
Scotty roll, only fuckin with players
Pourin 4, cookie smoke in the air
Cookies and lotto, in the cab, like I hit the lotto

[Chorus: Skooly]
Gotta keep her, pound of reefer
I get it, I drive a forin feature
She conceited, damb diva
She ain't perfect, she just got some forin features
Wearin shoes, not adidas
Move the work, nice to meet you
Hard to reach you, jump in the Beatle
Protect my body from the thotties, quiet, a secret

[Verse 4: Skippa Da Flippa]
Flippa!
Protect me, I bust it down if you let me
Ice on me, like Wayne Gretsky
50K tmorrow, I made her just swallo
All your pieces hollo, mine came in heavy
You need her, my AAP look like a freazer
Pop a seel, drop in the lieder
I kick the bitch out, right after I please her
RA engin, I got a 2 seater
I stay dressed down in Gucci
Ready to make me a movie
I go up on a Tuesday, walk around with them Ks and them Uzis
Took her to an Uber, she blew me
No lie, listen, we have no time
I pay the crew guy for new tires
Bitches be hatin, hoes be fuckin
They don't get nothin, except for dick for m
Flippa!

[Chorus: Skooly]
Gotta keep her, pound of reefer
I get it, I drive a forin feature
She conceited, damb diva
She ain't perfect, she just got some forin features
Wearin shoes, not adidas
Move the work, nice to meet you
Hard to reach you, jump in the Beatle
Protect my body from the thotties, quiet, a secret
