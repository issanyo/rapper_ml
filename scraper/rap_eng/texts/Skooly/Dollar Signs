I was the star of the month
Ridin around with my boys
Ridin around with the thugs
The streets they show me some love
That beef ain't nothing, lil boy
I keeping that heat by my gut
You got you some shooters, so what?
We love [?] when we boot up
Nigga be acting so tough

While I count up, promise I can't get enough

In the two seater, watch me switch lanes

House brick-layer fences
Watchin' off of camera lenses

Tryin different dick, what you doing?
Tryna steal it, she just want more
Need a bigger closet, one door

[Verse 4-Aston Martin Phi]
They talk it, we live it, we in the streets for real
I get it popping cause I done done it for real
I swear this beast made me
I rock cash money like I'm Baby
And when it comes to flossing ain't gone let up off em
Until I'm dead and six feet under living in the coffin
Cause I surround myself with bosses
I can't take no loss
I came from the ghetto, where niggas better be cautious

[Verse 5-Spodee]
Its been a long time coming, still gotta be patient
Know some real niggas with me, know some fuck niggas hating
I drive the ho crazy, I got it road raging
If he ain't coming with the money baby we can't have relations
Y'all niggas dick riding, I'm big timing
I been doing this shit
Nigga I been screwing this bitch, nigga I been fucking this ho
All I wanna get is somemore
Give me a Benz truck and a road
Give me an airplane and a boat
I'm staying prayed up on these hoes
