[Intro: Skooly]
Supah Mario
(Yeah)
They never done that for me before
(Hmmm)
They never seen what I'm leanin' on
(Yeah-mmm)
They never seen a big green before
They never seen how I bling before
I had the gun with some fingers(?) on
Cause they were coming for me before
And they never done that to me before
They never done that to me before
You gotta run into me ya know
You gonna run into me ya know
I know that I'm not gonna see you no
I know I'm not gonna see you though

[Hook: Skooly]
Tell em I'm sorry, tell em I'm sorry
My diamonds matching my garments
Ditch at the crew, ain't no platoon
Walked in that bitch like a homie
You talkin' bout swag? You talkin' bout us?
Tell them lil' bitches I'm on it
You talkin' bout cash? You talkin' bout racks?
Tell them lil' bitches I want it
You talkin' real fly, like you want that action
Tell them lil' niggas I want it
Tell them lil' niggas I want it
Tell them lil' niggas I want it

[Verse 1: Lil Duke & HiDoraah]
Tell them lil' niggas I want it
Tell them lil' bitches I'm sorry
My niggas ballin like Spaldin'
Clannin' them bitches, callin' they still callin'
My bitches they havin' water like dolphins
Play with me niggas put him in a coffin
Niggas get caught by the law and start talkin
Ridin with my whoadie she from New Orleans
Big ol' booty bitch I call her [?] parker
And I'm outta LA like I'mma Dodger
Came a long way from that block I was rival(?)
Tell them lil' niggas I want it
Tell them broke bitches I'm sorry
Sorry I'm just bein' honest

Show em the cash, the money a lil flash (?)

They finna you give em no cheese
Tell em I'm sorry, I'm really not sorry
I hate when you are, shit do some to me
(I beg your pardon)

[Hook: Skooly]
Tell em I'm sorry, tell em I'm sorry

Don't come where I chill cause we gunnin' back
Seen you myself you ain't comin back
And we let em live where the fun in that?
Cause it ain't no fun when I got the gun
This ain't no Roger, no Bonnie Raitt
Tell em stay out my business
Tell em I'm havin no remedy

Cause I got the nasty and freaky flow

[Hook: Skooly]
Tell em I'm sorry, tell em I'm sorry

Tell them lil' bitches I want it
You talking real fly, like you want that action
