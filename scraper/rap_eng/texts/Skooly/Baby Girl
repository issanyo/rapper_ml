[Chorus: Bandit Gang Marco]
Ride a nigga dick baby girl, talk your shit baby girl
Do a lil split baby girl, got a nigga on brick baby girl
Make a lil flick baby girl, got me pullin' on your wig baby girl
Don't be the wig baby girl, talk your shit baby girl
Throw it back baby girl, ride a nigga dick baby girl
Make it clap baby girl, stop all that cap baby girl
Talk your shit baby girl, suck a nigga dick baby girl
Swallow my kid baby girl, don't you run from this shit baby girl

[Verse 1: Bandit Gang Marco]
It's been some years since I knew you
I'm tryna come and maneuver
I got you back of the Uber
I'm tryna come and undo you
Tryna hit you with this ruler
Hit from the back and you throwing that shit
I'ma catch that lil shit, I'ma pop it
I'm tryna eat you like cabbage, put my face all up inside it
Make sure you come on my face baby girl
Stick my tongue out and you ride it
But that ain't enough for me, baby girl yeah I'm a freak (yeah)
I'ma make you squirt all on my t-shirt baby
I'ma make you pull the sheets off of the bed
I'ma put my hand around your neck
Choke your ass while we having sex
I'ma put you on top of me, ride it like you never did before
I'ma make you tap out, beat it, beat it
Screaming bae I want some more

[Pre-Chorus: Bandit Gang Marco]
Come ride this dick
Girl come ride this dick
Come ride this dick
Bae come ride this dick

[Chorus: Bandit Gang Marco]
Ride a nigga dick baby girl, talk your shit baby girl
Do a lil split baby girl, got a nigga on brick baby girl
Make a lil flick baby girl, got me pullin' on your wig baby girl
Don't be the wig baby girl, talk your shit baby girl
Throw it back baby girl, ride a nigga dick baby girl
Make it clap baby girl, stop all that cap baby girl
Talk your shit baby girl, suck a nigga dick baby girl
Swallow my kid baby girl, don't you run from this shit baby girl

[Verse 2: Skooly]
You really can't trip (don't trip, don't trip), dealing with a crip
Putting whips on your hip baby girl
Fun sized you get flipped
I really can't trip baby girl (trip)
You're sick of my shit (girl you're sick of my shit)
You're sick of my shit, ain't none of your business
Let me tickle your clit, let me pull on your inches
You ain't making it hard for me
You swiping your card for me
I got you going hard, ooh, bitch better thank God for me
Top bitch around the squad
Bitch better not be embarrassing
I'm talking 'bout on God (I'm talking 'bout on God)
I ain't taking no shots (ain't taking no shots)
I ain't taking no shots (ain't taking no shots)
You take off them shorts, bitch take off them shorts
That pussy like water fleek, I'm talking 'bout Fiji fi
Sex with me so amazing, I'm talking 'bout RiRi
Put that pussy on a CD, I wanna see it 3D
Need a neighborhood bitch like NuNu
I think I really need you too

[Chorus: Bandit Gang Marco]
Ride a nigga dick baby girl, talk your shit baby girl
Do a lil split baby girl, got a nigga on brick baby girl
Make a lil flick baby girl, got me pullin' on your wig baby girl
Don't be the wig baby girl, talk your shit baby girl
Throw it back baby girl, ride a nigga dick baby girl
Make it clap baby girl, stop all that cap baby girl
Talk your shit baby girl, suck a nigga dick baby girl
Swallow my kid baby girl, don't you run from this shit baby girl
