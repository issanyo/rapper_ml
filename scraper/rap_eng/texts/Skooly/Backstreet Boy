[Intro]
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
Backstreet boy

[Chorus]
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah

[Verse 1]
I, I don't give no fuck 'bout no enemy
Fuck that lil bitch on a dinner date
My wrist is frozen, it's in a lake
I got more hoes than J Timberlake nigga
Ain't no tellin' what I'm in today
Maserati, Tesla, and a Wraith
Shawty say she wasn't feelin' safe
Told that bitch to get a realer bae
Tell me you not with him
Tell me this shit ain't impossible
Tell me this shit wasn't costin' you
Tell me this shit wasn't obstacles
I come from the block, was impossible
I come from the block, it ain't possible
I come from them pissy apartments
Rats and roaches and possums, shit
You know the game adopted him, you know they searchin' for bodies
Boy get that pain up out of him, healin' or hurtin' somebody
Ain't nothin' change about him, it ain't no shame about it
I pull up to work with a thotty, I pull up work in big body

[Chorus]
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah

[Verse 2]
Straight out that water, no immigrant
You wouldn't want to see images
I wouldn't even want you to feel this shit
All of my water was limited
Raised on the west of the city, city
Where they ain't showin' no pity, pity
All of my clothes was shitty, shitty
Now I get money like Diddy, litty
Shawty gon' show me them titties, huh
No she ain't havin' no business, huh
Knowin' I give her the business, huh
Knowin' I come from the trenches, huh
Might blow with the bomb, it's tickin'
I fucked my first young lil bitch
My brother got slumped in the kitchen
And all of my partners was junkies
The game is lame without him
You can't replace him or stop him
Boy get that hate up out of them
Ballin' up, hurry your partner
You know my partner a shotter
You know my brother was mobbin'
I pull up to work with a thotty, you get in
She probably twerk for a lot of your friends, yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
You know I come from the backstreet, yeah
