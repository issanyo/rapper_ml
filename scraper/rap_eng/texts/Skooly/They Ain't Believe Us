[Chorus: Skooly]
They don't want to meet you
They don't want to greet you
You fuckin' deceivers
Make you believe me, yeah
I'ma make you believe me, yeah
Check me out, look
They tried to delete me
But they can't defeat me
No they can't defeat me
Make 'em hard to believe it, yeah
Make 'em hard to believe it, yeah
Ah, come on

[Verse 1: Ralo]
They know I came from that dirt
Mama didn't take me to church
My family called me first
Fuck it it could've been worse
They tried to make me be somethin' that I ain't
I told 'em I could, they told me I can't
I know who I am so fuck what they think
You give 'em your all and they still gon' complain
I jump in my whip and I switch the lanes
They know that I'm aiming for bigger things
You were my boy 'til them niggas came
Soon as they came you lil niggas changed
Could you do that for me 'cause I did it for us
Boy you gotta slow down, you can't be in a rush
You can't never look back 'cause they lookin' at us
We go to war for whoever with us
They want me to fall but I never did it
My baby mama fuck up my image
Sometimes I wish that we never did it
I got enough of these stupid bitches
I stack up my cash, I don't look at my past
I ain't lookin' back, I don't do shit like that
The only wish I got is we never met

[Chorus: Skooly]
Don't want to meet you
Don't want to greet you
You fuckin' deceivers
Make you believe me, yeah
I'ma make you believe me, yeah
Check me out, look
They tried to delete me
But they can't defeat me
No they can't defeat me
Make 'em hard to believe it, yeah
Make 'em hard to believe it, yeah
Ah, come on

[Verse 2: Ralo]
They ain't believe in us
I made them all believers
I dropped out of school
And made more money than our teachers
I thought them niggas was better than me
Now them niggas is jealous of me
I'm the lil nigga they wanna delete
But that is a job they won't ever complete
I thought them niggas were kinda cool
But they tryna stop what I'm tryna do
Don't talk that shit if it's not in you
'cause I got some niggas who'll body you
They tried to tell me that I went up north
You should be happy I'm out of the bluff
They tore me down but I never gave up
They play them games but they don't play with us
They know I'll go in your shit nigga
My shooters comin' to get niggas
I'm the smaller dude but I'm a big nigga
I walk around like I'm six niggas
If they knock at my door then I'm knocking shit off
We gon' go hard if they think this shit soft
I got more money than you and your boss
Everybody you lose ain't really a loss

[Chorus: Skooly]
They don't want to meet you
The don't want to greet you
You fuckin' deceivers
Make you believe me, yeah
I'ma make you believe me, yeah
Check me out, look
They tried to delete me
But they can't defeat me
No they can't defeat me
Make 'em hard to believe me, yeah
Make 'em hard to believe me, yeah
Ah, come on
