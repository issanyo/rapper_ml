[Chorus: Skooly]
Bout to cut another way, bout to cut another way
Cut a whole nother way
Cut a whole nother way, cut a whole nother way
This a whole nother way, this a whole nother face
Got a whole nother case, couple shows in the safe
I been runnin from the date, that's a whole nother day

[Verse 1: Skooly]
I hop out the whip, a nother 200, these niggas don't o me nothin
Hop out the bitch, she o me money
Bitch, show me something
Talkin bout tak m out the door, you kow I love to feed m
Talkin bout knockin shit out with the poll, talkin bout Derek Jeeder
I'm talkin that bag on they ass, ain't talkin that Woron Zeeter
Talkin like crash on her ass, talkin that Don Cheetle
Fly you seen, it real
I told her I'm Don Chee
I told her, my gun illegal
I told her my bong cheaper, she call me good reefer
On her, I run the feaver
In fact, I blow my reefer
Lil bitch, you ain't know me iether
Tryna look like he a Beatle
And I hope they free Lil Peter
Pour a three up in my liter
My diamonds come from Kenya

[Chorus: Skooly]
Bout to cut another way, bout to cut another way
Cut a whole nother way
Cut a whole nother way, cut a whole nother way
This a whole nother way, this a whole nother face
Got a whole nother case, couple shows in the safe
I been runnin from the date, that's a whole nother day

[Verse 2: Key Glock]
Sold a whole lotta weight, made a whole lotta cake
Ride with a lot of Ks, shoe box, no safe
Traps, 2K
Stash house, that's safe
Blue face, no chace
Hang with some slouches, you know we going ape
Got Bananas on the K, the way will make you bake
Jump like a parade, drum clap you like hurray
Used to surv a lot of J, just to go and get the Js
Young nigga up, big bucks now
All my jewllery, bust down
Diamonds talkin insane now
Got a bitch giving me the crown
King shit, take a bow
Take my walet out, put the Patek on, don't drown

[Chorus: Skooly]
Bout to cut another way, bout to cut another way
Cut a whole nother way
Cut a whole nother way, cut a whole nother way
This a whole nother way, this a whole nother face
Got a whole nother case, couple shows in the safe
I been runnin from the date, that's a whole nother day
