[Intro: Skooly]
Quan pulled me up, it's a suicide
Percocets on me, I'm do or die
That Draco got 30, it's do or die
I pull up and murder, it's do or die
We never heard of you, do or die
Yike, yike, yike
What's in my cup is a suicide

[Hook: Skooly + Rich Homie Quan]
What's in my cup is a suicide
Drinking on dirty, I'm stirring up confusion
What's in your cup is a suicide
.40 on my waist, you don't want me to use it
Percocets on me, I'm do or die
I'm talking about a 83333
That Draco is on me, it's do or die
Click, clack, bang, click, clack, bang, nigga

[Bridge: Skooly + Rich Homie Quan]
Doors opened up, yeah suicide
Riding round listening to do or die
Me and Skooly got a game on lock
Like some brand new boots with the shoes tied
What's in my cup is a suicide
What's in my cup is a suicide
What's in your cup is a suicide
What's in my cup is a suicide
Percocets on me, it's do or die
Perky, perky, perky, perk
That Draco is on me, it's do or die
That Draco is on me, it's do or die

[Verse 1: Skooly]
Yeah King Cosa, Gotti
You know I'm do or die
It ain't no newer sign
Don't throw up no newer signs
Okay, you niggas hide all your daughters
I'm in that bitch with Quan
Chopper we got weigh a ton
Don't give a fuck bout your son
Don't give a fuck bout your son
You ever seen a real crip with a blood?
You ever seen me fiending for the drugs?
You never seen me fiending for the drugs
You never seen me fiending for the mud
They was telling me they showing me love
They was holding me, they knew what it was
They was showing me I know where the broads
You get shot nigga just like a mug
And my brother still behind the wall
And he's still on that bullshit
Used to have me on that bullshit
Took the car, made him get out and walk
I went back and forth into it with the law
Caught the nigga coming out of the mall
Wasn't winning did some time for y'all
I was really, really down for y'all

[Hook: Skooly + Rich Homie Quan]
What's in my cup is a suicide
Drinking on dirty, I'm stirring up confusion
What's in your cup is a suicide
.40 on my waist, you don't want me to use it
Percocets on me, I'm do or die
I'm talking about a 83333
That Draco is on me, it's do or die
Click, clack, bang, click, clack, bang, nigga

[Bridge: Skooly + Rich Homie Quan]
Doors opened up, yeah suicide
Riding round listening to do or die
Me and Skooly got a game on our 'jects
Like some brand new boots with the shoes tied
What's in my cup is a suicide
What's in my cup is a suicide
What's in your cup is a suicide
What's in my cup is a suicide
Percocets on me, it's do or die
Perky, perky, perky, perk
That Draco is on me, it's do or die
That Draco is on me, it's do or die

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
What the hell they mad at me for?
I got more cars than repo
Taking niggas shit on Friday
Got a nigga feeling like Deebo
And I gotta stick to the H-I-G code
And I gotta watch for the HIV hoes
My bedroom got two poles in it
Gotta watch out for these ho niggas
I'm a fast runner but I hate slow bitches
My little boy love him some Goldfish
My bitches want nothing but this dick
100,000 I spent on one ring
That ain't a lie nigga you can ask Icebox
Got a bitch in Chicago, I call her White Sox
She shy so I fuck her with the lights out
Hot boy, how we're living a different lifestyle
Working all day nigga, no nights off
They thought he bit my swag but he bite sauce
Homie keep going in when the mic on, yeah
Imagine how hard this would be if I would write y'all

[Interlude: Rich Homie Quan]
I want some whole artist shit man You know I'm saying? I'm talking about when them doors open up shit, haha. I ainâ€™t talkin' bout puttin' no gun to my fuckin' head. I'ma run them motherfucking bands up, hey

[Hook: Skooly + Rich Homie Quan]
What's in my cup is a suicide
Drinking on dirty, I'm stirring up confusion
What's in your cup is a suicide
.40 on my waist, you don't want me to use it
Percocets on me, I'm do or die
I'm talking about a 83333
That Draco is on me, it's do or die
Click, clack, bang, click, clack, bang, nigga
