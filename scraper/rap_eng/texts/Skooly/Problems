[Hook: Skateboard Skooly]
Feelin' nauseous, hearin' voices
All this dough, all these hoes, i got choices
Don't do this for fun
That made me the one
Nigga had to hustle for the things that i want
I might roll me up a blunt just to smoke my problems away
I might pour me up a drank just to sip my problems away
I might fuck a niqqa bitch she can suck my problems away
Im young gettin' money, fuck my problems today

[Verse 1: Skateboard Skooly]
Plenty lube, my slippers whisper in jimmy chew
Get plenty food, i doubled up on that benny's food
Not many jewels but I'm shinin' my niqqa
Yes I'm shinin' like a diamond i figure
I'm gone shine with my niqqas
No surprise, you pussy niqqas deprived
Never divide i multiply im gone reside with mines
Over grind they gone respect it
Overtime I'm goin extra
Won't neglect the fact that mamma didn't search for contraception
I put two grams in a blunt (and we smoke)
Syrup all in my soda pop. (give me more)
Imma make yo bitch give me top
She can suck my problems away Imma fuck my problems today

Feelin' nauseous, hearin' voices
All this dough, all these hoes, i got choices
Don't do this for fun
That made me the one
Nigga had to hustle for the things that I want
I might roll me up a blunt just to smoke my problems away
I might pour me up a drank just to sip my problems away
I might fuck a niqqa bitch she can suck my problems away
Im young gettin' money, fuck my problems today

[Verse 2: Kaelub]
Many or picked but it's just a few chosen
I go through circles and options just to get the money
I'm gone hold my reputation if i don't do nothin'
That's why i grind til' i shine, turn nothin' into something
Only problems is serious yeah we all got problems
Gotta bible, bankroll, ratchet yeah dem real choices
I'm seeing dead people and president voices
Pull up in dat old skool i know you hear them horses
Most of my problems come from he say she say shit
That's when i get to stuffin' white owls and shit
When i get mad i hit the mall and get to buyin' shit
All dis money got me paranoid im cautious
