Boy I heard ya homie want me killed
My cousin told e focus on my deal
I just wanna roll up and chill
How these niggas hoes like they is
Boy it ain't no hoes where I live
You can get exposed where I live
They don't raise hoes where I live
You can get exposed where I live

[Verse 1:]
Young Atlanta call me Mr. Georgia
Bitch my necklace make my wrist important
I... came far bitch I'm going farther
I... go hard bitch I'm going harder
Back in the days I wasn't paid
I probably would've caught yo bitch or more
Coming from the apartments
Living with my grandmomma and my father
Shit got harder
Days got harder
Plans got smarter
Nigga had problems then choppas got brought up
Ahh shit, young nigga bout to bomb down
Sipping syrup talking to my cousin
Drugs got me calmed down

[Verse 2:]
I...
Bitch I'm right right back at it
Any nigga wanna smoke it we can match at it
Bitch I'm bad like a crack addict
Bitch I gotta bad come and snag at it
Don't you snag at it
Cuz probably eat yo face
Cuz coming off the waist
Damn, brother lost his life (?)
This ain't really life today
Damn, could it be the price to pay
Cause imma take them all the way
No more settling for less, we going all the way
I wish my brother didn't get called away
I just wish he could've called away

Yeah
