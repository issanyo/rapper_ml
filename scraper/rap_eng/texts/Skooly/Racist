[Chorus]
I'm talkin' old school, them old shoes, talkin' Asics
Face it, you basic, boy you wasted
Want a bad bitch, not average, got me chasing
White girls, black cars, racist

[Verse]
My bitch and your bitch ain't the same, yeah
My ho and your ho ain't the same, yeah
My flow and your flow ain't the same, yeah
See my flow, see my flow it can't be tamed, yeah
Now eyes closed, your eyes closed, let it rain, yeah
Ride slow, ride slow, let me bang, yeah
My clique, ain't the clique you can claim, yeah
Ride slick, time chef, let it rain, yeah
See my bitch, whoa, your bitch ain't the same dawg
My clique, with your bitch, it's a gang dawg
Woo, saw me with a carter phone, watch it rain dawg
You's a lame dawg, we ain't the same dawg
I go insane dawg, bitch I'm untamed dawg
Your bitch a deranged dawg, she got the main dawg
You ain't the gang dawg, someone I can't call, dawg
How many rings dawg dawg? how many chains dawg?
Ooh, shit, how many chains dawg?
They know your name dawg
Shit, listen, woo
Give a fuck 'bout the fame dawg, I was a caged dawg
I'm feelin' pain dawg, this ain't the same dawg
You can get blamed dawg, I get it deranged dawg
My brother got stained dawg, so I gotta stand dawg
Do you have heart or not? don't care if you hard or not
Damn right, we really gon' finish this shit, don't care if you start or not
Bitch we ain't hard to find, I want the large amount
Thirty on me, make 'em 'pologize
I got the same one the robbers got
We got the same dough the Carters got
Ooh shit, youngin, he be in all the spots
He got them diamonds, the water, ahh
He got them bitches on water, uhh
You gotta listen, I'm sergeant, uh
I ain't gotta tell you I'm sorry, uh
This shit that I'm spittin' ain't posion
That's why the fuck I be chargin', uh
These bitches be fuckin' and chargin', uh
These niggas be faking and flodging
These niggas be faking and talking, uh
They bringing they name up in charges
We don't give a fuck what you call a snitch
You gotta suck when you call it bitch

She bootin' up and she call it grits

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' old school, them old shoes, talkin' Asics
Face it, you basic, boy you wasted
Want a bad bitch, not average, got me chasing
White girls, black cars, racist
