[Verse 1]
Baby you a beast with your body
I know that that's the least of your worries
I heard that you a freak, you ain't sorry
I heard that you a freak, I ain't worried
Do you want a chain, do you want to change?
I ain't runnin' game, I ain't runnin' game
Don't listen to them things that they runnin' bae
Don't listen to them games that they runnin' bae

[Chorus]
I like it when you lose yourself to me, huh huh
I like it when you make your hips, and your lips move
Make your hips move
I like it when you lose yourself to me, come on
I like it when you shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Huh,  shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit

[Verse 2]
Shot her on the ass like I wanted to
Like I wanted to
Make her put that ass right in front of you
Make you feel uncomfortable
I'ma be the man when I'm done with you
When I'm done with you
What you don't understand, girl I come to prove
Ain't gettin' none to you
Do you want a chain, do you want to change?
I ain't runnin' game, I ain't runnin' game
I just want your frame, I don't want your brain
I just got something that I gotta say
Don't listen to them things that they runnin' bae
Don't listen to them games that they runnin' bae
I'm tryna put a thing in your front and play
And if you wanna play baby come and play

[Chorus]
I like the way you lose yourself to me, huh huh
I like the way you make your hips, and your lips move
Make your hips move
I like the way you lose yourself to me, come on
I like it when you shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Huh,  shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit, shake your shit
Shake your shit
