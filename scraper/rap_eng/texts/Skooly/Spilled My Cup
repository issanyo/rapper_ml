[Intro: Derez De'Shon]
I just spilled my cup
I just spilled my cup
I just spilled my cup
I just spilled my cup, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
So when I wake up I hop out the bed and pray I live alone
I swear I stay with a problem like we live to go
Sleepin' with the chopper like we have a kid together
Go hard today and hope tomorrow go a little bit better

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
I send her off, she gettin' tired of this, I'm sick of tryin' the shit
Wish I could rewind some shit, go back in time and shit
But I gotta deal with it, my problems, yeah I gotta live with it
Been through so much pain, I promise I'm still healin', I promise I still feel it, yeah
I'm tryna run up a meal ticket, yeah
Somebody feed, me I gotta be dreamin', yeah
Somebody wake me up, I cannot make this up
This morning I jumped out the bed without makin' it up
And I ain't even been asleep in four days
On the Adderall all week goin' crazy
Drinkin' Henny straight out the bottle, no chasing
Ain't nobody gon' help me with my problems
Gon' feed my baby, nobody so

[Pre-Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
So when I wake up I hop out the bed and pray I live alone
I swear I stay with a problem like we live to go
Sleepin' with the chopper like we have a kid together
Go hard today and hope tomorrow go a little bit better

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I just spilled my cup, I just spilled my cup
I just spilled my cup, I just spilled my cup, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Skooly]
I walked in the building with both of my cups in my hand and went right to the nosebleeds
Some of these women don't know me, half of these niggas they owe me
Your favorite rapper done cloned me, half of my city disowned me
This shit ain't meant what it 'posed to be
Niggas in field, they can't go to sleep
I'm talkin' west side Mr. West, need a way bigger desk, uh, hah
ClayCo with Derez, Soufside with an F
Barnyard Ferragamo, cow tide on her belt
I'm finally securing some money, so mama can feel important
You know what it is

[Pre-Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
So when I wake up I hop out the bed and pray I live alone
I swear I stay with a problem like we live to go
Sleepin' with the chopper like we have a kid together
Go hard today and hope tomorrow go a little bit better

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I just spilled my cup, I just spilled my cup
I just spilled my cup, I just spilled my cup, yeah yeah
