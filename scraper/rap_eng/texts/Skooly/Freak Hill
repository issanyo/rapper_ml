[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
I'm on some other shit tonight, right?
Some Freak Hill shit
Eleventy-two crew, yeah

[Chorus]
Came out the wall with this one, came out the hall with this one, uh
Fresh out the stall with this one, uh, I'm breakin' the law with this one
Me and my dog with this one, uh
I'm bangin', I need a speaker, I'm hot, I need a fever
The principal tried to keep me, I tried to fuck the teacher
I'm with the shit, ayy, come get your bitch, ayy
I'm poppin' shit, say, I'ma be rich, yeah

[Verse]
I'm poppin' paper now, time to shake the town
Nigga don't want me 'round, yeah, they know I own the crown, uh
But nigga don't want me down, I'ma start takin' shit, uh
I'm talkin' 'bout doin' 'em foul, uh, I'm talkin' 'bout flagrant, uh
They think I'm the shit, I know I'm the shit, but ain't got enough paper yet, uh
I came in this bitch, I go out this bitch, with all of the paper then, uh
I'm with your bitch, and I'm with your bitch, she say I'm her favorite
I hop in the whip, I pull out the vip, I'm speedin', I'm speedin', I'm racin', uh
Been gettin' to the paper, uh, uh, shit got contagious, uh
I had to make it, uh, I had to save it, uh, uh
Niggas was hatin' (niggas was hatin'), I really loved you niggas, uh
Put nothin' above you niggas, uh, I really loved you niggas, uh
I came from the bottom and shit, uh
You wasn't bottom with me
You ain't give me none' when I'm broke, yeah
Didn't want to be bothered with me, uh
Don't need your sorry, I'm not that sorry, keep your apology please, uh
I'm out in Maui sippin' a bottle, I got a model with me (sick)

[Chorus]
Came out the wall with this one, came out the hall with this one, uh
Fresh out the stall with this one, uh, I'm breakin' the law with this one
Me and my dog with this one, uh
I'm bangin', I need a speaker, I'm hot, I need a fever
The principal tried to keep me, I tried to fuck the teacher
I'm with the shit, ayy, come get your bitch, ayy
I'm poppin' shit, say, I'ma be rich, yeah
