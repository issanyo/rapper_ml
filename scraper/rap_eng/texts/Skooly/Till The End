[Intro: YNW Melly]
Mmm, mhm
Young nigga world and Iâ€™m with Skooly, I'm with Skooly

[Pre-Chorus: YNW Melly]
Ayy, I got your bitch off a xan, xan
She wanna fuck on my man, and
She tryna pull off her panties
She ain't even wet like the sand
I got my feet in the sand
Giuseppe sandal when I step, huh
Young nigga thuggin' to death
We shoot at whoever, don't care 'bout the rep, yeah

[Chorus: Skooly]
Jumpin' right out of the gym
Shoot everything but the rim
All of my bitches a ten
I wanna fuck on they friends
Deep in that water got fiends
Won't let 'em cross me again
I done lost all of my friends
Young nigga shit till the end, aww

[Verse 1: YNW Melly]
Ahwoah
Bitch wanna fuck after the show
You didn't ride for me
Thought it was real but you lied to me, bitch
Even my guys can see, huh
Even my blind could see
That this is a dynasty
Young nigga world is a dynasty
I'm in the booth with Skooly
He coolin', I'm boolin'
But fuck it though, we got that brazy flow
I'm 'bout to fuck this bitch
Skooly hit that hoe on the floor

[Verse 2: Skooly]
I ain't fuckin on the floor
'Cause I know she's feeling nothing
Put it in her ribs and back
She got to give it back
She got to tell me
She got to show me sum'
Bangin' these racks all day
Lil' bitch you owe me one, aww

[Pre-Chorus: YNW Melly]
Ayy, I got your bitch off a xan, xan
She wanna fuck on my man, and
She tryna pull off her panties
She ain't even wet like the sand
I got my feet in the sand
Giuseppe sandal when I step, huh
Young nigga thuggin' to death
We shoot at whoever, don't care 'bout the rep, yeah

[Chorus: Skooly]
Jumpin' right out of the gym
Shoot everything but the rim
All of my bitches a ten
I wanna fuck on they friends
Deep in that water got fiends
Won't let 'em cross me again
I done lost all of my friends
Young nigga shit till the end, aww

[Verse 3: YNW Melly]
I'm swimmin' in that water like a whip
She say she like the way young nigga whip, ayy
She see the .30 Glock, extended clip
Forgiato's on the whip
Make your lil' hoe hit the whip
Then I'ma make that lil' hoe hit the nae nae
Australian her fabric
This big Glock
I'm not gay but it'll fuck ya ass like a faggot
And my diamonds shining, ya they blackenin'
But I don't even got her braggin'
Cuz my young niggas 'bout that action
Really pistol packin'
Moonwalk
Michael Jackson

[Pre-Chorus: YNW Melly]
Ayy, I got your bitch off a xan, xan
She wanna fuck on my man, and
She tryna pull off her panties
She ain't even wet like the sand
I got my feet in the sand
Giuseppe sandal when I step, huh
Young nigga thuggin' to death
We shoot at whoever, don't care 'bout the rep, yeah

[Chorus: Skooly]
Jumpin' right out of the gym
Shoot everything but the rim
All of my bitches a ten
I wanna fuck on they friends
Deep in that water got fiends
Won't let 'em cross me again
I done lost all of my friends
Young nigga shit till the end, aww
