Really was out dog, I was in law calls
Now I'm a boss dog, Hugo Boss drawers
Look what my socks cost, your bitch in my call log
She want it raw dog, she lickin' my dog paw, roof
Y'all ain't foolin' us, lil homie they schoolin' us
Shoot heavy duty stuff, off of the doolie truck
I'm livin' righteous, you ain't excitin' us
My lil homies steal and scam, you couldn't swipe with us
You ain't alright with us, you cannot fight with us
Another one bite the dust, another one bite the dust
Nobody piped me up, they tried to write me up
And I'm in the building bitch, really really rich
