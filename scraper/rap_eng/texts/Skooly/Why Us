[Intro]
Girl says:
I want you,but I gotta leave you
Dude says:
But,But I need you
Skooly says:
Man you ain't gotta apologize to her! Man you trippin'

Chorus:
I'm tired of waitin' by the phone
And when we hate each other I just wanna be alone
Sometimes I wonder why this had to be us
Shit like the arguing an fuss
Or it might just be the trust
Damn why
Damn why us(oo)

V1 (girl):
Can't even go a day without the fussin'
Every little thing turns into you and me cussin'
Our love is supposed to be easy
They tell me let him go
I'm young so be free
Yeah I'm young
I know
But its hard to let you go
When it good you know its real good
SO if its strong I gotta make it understood that

Chorus:
I'm tired of waitin' by the phone
And when we hate each other I just wanna be alone
Sometimes I wonder why this had to be us
Shit like the arguing an fuss
Or it might just be the trust
Damn why
Damn why us(oo)

V2 (Bandit Gang Marco):
S-O-R-R-Y
I'm sorry baby bout last night
My phone ain't dead I just got caught up
I promise to God I'mma straighten up
Don't wanna ever ever fuss
Don't listen to the haters babe
Its all about us
I wonder what it is when I
Smile we smile
They wonder what is is
(Skooly laughs)
Chorus:
I'm tired of waitin' by the phone (Skooly: What?!)
And when we hate each other I just wanna be alone (Skooly: me too)
Sometimes I wonder why this had to be us (Skooly:i wonder the same thing)
Shit like the arguing an fuss(skooly: that be you that be you)
Or it might just be the trust (Skooly: You dont trust a nigga, you dont trust a nigga for real.)
Damn why (Skooly:Go through my phone all the time and everything)
Damn why us(oo)

V3 (Skooly):
You paper scissors rock my world
Plus you my settle down type of girl
Don't change the fact that you be doin' that
How you be doin' that
Why you be doin' that, girl
And you just keep tryin' me constantly
And yo friend keep eyein' me wantin' me
But I can't do that to you
Cus you the only one who makes my fairy tail come true
Dont be waintin' by the phone
If you got a problem then just leave me alone
Come to think that it was never what you thought
It was both of our fault (NO!)
I remember we was just a crush
Damn why us
Damn why us (ohh)
