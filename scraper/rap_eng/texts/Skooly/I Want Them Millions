[Intro: Hundred Kae]
All we know is hustle, yeah, it's in our genes
Young rich nigga with a real big check
Young rich nigga, we'll die about respect

[Pre-Hook]
This ain't rap money stuffed off in my jeans
All we know is hustle, yeah, it's in our genes
Whip it with an egg beater, beat it, Billy Jean
And it's all about the crew, it ain't no "I" in team

[Hook]
I want them millions
I want them millions (Swear)
I want them millions (4x)

[Verse 1: Hundred Kae]
If you a real nigga
You a hustla, get money by any means, I'm fuckin' with ya
Been gettin' it out the streets
Mom and dad raised a beast
I got the work, so they fuckin' with 'em
If a nigga take you off, then that's your loss
Yeah, you know that you shouldn't have been fuckin' with 'em
If a nigga don't eat, then that nigga just a leach
Ha, call him a fuck nigga!
Hustle in all of our genes
Put racks in all of my jeans
Get money by any means
I get high just a like a fiend
I do this shit for the cream
I know it ain't no "I" in no team, but I do this shit for my team
I do that shit that you dream
Margielas and Balmain my jeans
I'ma stay down just to stay up
Rapping and we trapping, she (?) us
Ain't frontin' (?), never fronted us
Never let a bitch lil' boy us
Hustle in my DNA
Ballin', but no NBA
Flyin', but no TSA
All of my spots got a safe

[Pre-hook]
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Hundred Kae]
All of my niggas (?), all of my niggas 'bout money
All of my niggas first (?), none of 'em sit on no benches
All of my niggas want mo', all of my niggas went pro
We get the bags for the low
Patna done fucked on yo hoe
My patna thinking he Bosh and Jordan
Cause all he sold/soul was glow
My patna from The Bluff, sold more dog food than the Kroger
I'ma die about my city, it's like I tote a four-leaf clover
I came with my fam, I don't have my chauffeur
I don't got no feelings
Yo crew (?)
She swallow my children, I'm counting my benjis
I want them millions, I want them millions
Swear, I want them millions
Ball hard, chinchilla
Don't talk on no pillow
I pop just like pistol
Ballin' like all of the Michael's
We killin' shit just like Jack the Reaper

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pinkbitchh]
You bitches is trippin', I'm stackin' and flippin'
You won't catch me slippin'
You all in yo feelings, don't mix that with business
I need me a million, better yet, I need a billion
My hair is Brazilian, my bitches Brazilian
Fuck a nigga feelings
Pussy worth a million
In the penthouse chillin'
Hunnits and fifties, you know how I rock
Trappin' and stackin', it go 'round the clock
With my trap bitches, we pull up in drops
The way that I kick it, he threw me my (?)

[Verse 4: Skooly]
If you came to stay, why the hell you leave?
The youngin' here to stay, shit, I will never leave
Even if they fuckin' quarantined where I be
You might not be able to even see what I've seen
Ah, the pain is all in my dream
Family's all that I need
They all in my dreams, they all in my genes
I know that they all on my team
Paparazzi finally got me
I should catch his ass
Now I'm your favorite rapper's problem
Watch me catch his ass!
Yeah
