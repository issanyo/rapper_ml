Had to live my life without no trust, these niggas chase
Break, break, break, break down
Had to live my life without no trust, these niggas chase
Yeah, look, okay

Shit wasn't goin' right, but all my life I had to fake
Prayin' for that night, I want the night I change my life
Yeah, want that night I change my life, yeah
Shit was goin' bad, had to do somethin' about it
Bitches goin' left, I'm glad I fucked 'em and got out it
You niggas the turn up, hell nah I ain't vouchin'
Nah, I ain't vouchin'
My brother told me whip, he brought the whip into the city
Brought it in the crib, he started whippin' in the kitchen, yeah
If you wasn't really with me, I can't vouch it but I know
My brother put dope in them couches, yeah
My mama wanted that shit out, yeah, yeah
My mama almost tossed it out, yeah, yeah
It's a hundred thousand dollars my brother put inside the house and you was finna throw it out, yeah
Shit, I mean, a hundred fuckin' thousand worth of drugs and you was finna throw it out
Woo, goddamn, that's some shit
A hundred thousand dollars worth of drugs, you was finna throw it in the mud
In the mud, in the mud, yeah
How I got into drugs, my brother really thug
Yeah, then he died, then I cried, now I got nothin' to hold me up
Hold me up, hold me up, hold me up, hold me up
Now I got no one to pour me up, pour me up, pour me up
I wish I could talk to him, pour me up
Come down and pour me up, pour me up, pour me up
Come down and roll one up, roll one up, roll one up
Come down and pour me up, pour me up, pour me up
Hold it down, come down and hold me up
You gotta hold me up (shit)
I'm talkin' 'bout this shit bad, you dig what I'm sayin'
Jim I miss the fuck out you dog, damn
Shit be crazy, I'm talkin' 'bout
Roll like two backwoods or somethin'
Might just sip 'em all by myself and I just talk to Jimmy
Even though he ain't here
Shit weird but it's the only way I can goddamn stop from crying inside
Think about it like that
Think about Bankroll every day
Shit crazy

I'm coming right off the glass
I'm coming right out the bags
I had to live with the wrong
I had to work with the bad
I'm treating first like it's last
Had to be first on they ass
What could be worser than last?
What could be worser than last?
My partner say he doin' bad
They took like thirty-two bags
I'm doin' verses for cash
I know you lurk on the gram
My partner be lurking on land
My brother was servin' them yams
He whipped that shit with his hand
Think he got killed by his man, damn
Think I just had a lil moment
Ah yeah, think I just had a lil moment
Oh, think I just had a lil moment
Oh oh oh, think I just had a lil moment
Ah, let me breathe

Still goin' through the same shit
Still movin' on the lane switch
Niggas switchin' on some lame shit
Bitches want me on some gang shit
Brother had a lot of dope money
That's a whole lot of chains bitch
Don't you ever ever claim rich
Boy I grew up kind of famous
On the block with a Glock
Better watch for your watch
They'll take off with your chain, shit
That's a whole lot of gang shit
I miss you Ball
I'm hurtin' inside (Bankroll)
Jimmy gone, Jimmy died
I done forgot how to cry
Why did Ayman have to die?
Why did Ayman have to ride?
Couldn't look in Kristy eyes
Couldn't look in Kristy eyes
I'm still goin' official
Rockie you know that I miss you
I'm still alone when I'm smoking
Ain't forgot about you Smokie
Still sippin', gettin' loaded
Still trippin' 'bout the homie
Troup died, I was broken
On some neighborhood rollin'
I'm so damn unfocused
I lost a lot of focus
Had me damn near hopeless
I lost a lot of hope
Ain't a damn thing funny
Not a lot of jokes
Can't take a damn thing from me
I hurt a lot of folks
Listen, I cannot lie to folks
Better pick your side, you probably die with both
You can't pick your fights, better not miss your time
If you risk your life, represent your side
Represent your guys, you don't get no sign
You gon' miss your guys, you gon' miss those times
Shit, all 'bout my dawg (Bankroll gone too, Shawty Lo gone too)
All 'bout dawg (Bankroll gon' too)
I miss my dawg
I miss my dawg

I'm comin' straight off the block
I'm comin' straight for the top
My motivation was guap
Much hesitation with cop
Don't need no further assist
Don't mean to burden you niggas
You tryna live in a room
I'm sippin' syrup in the kitchen
Woah bitch be worrying a nigga
I had to hurry to go get it
I had to hurry to go get it
Shit wasn't workin' for nigga
These bitches be working these niggas
These bitches be settin' these niggas
Ever since I lost my man to a damn bag
If it ain't about a bag I ain't gonna say it
I ain't gonna say it
I ain't gonna say it

All 'bout dawg
All 'bout dawg
I miss my dawg
Lost my man 'bout a bag
I can't go out sad
Had to go out sad
I can't go

On my man
I can't go out sad

Shit, I done lost my man
Got my memory boy
