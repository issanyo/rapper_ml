[Pre-Chorus: Skooly]
Water is up on me
Diamonds in my motherfuckin' charm bling
Money is up on me
Bitch I came from nothin', I was starvin'

[Chorus: Skooly]
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Prezi]
Peel a nigga like cocaine
I'm ridin' 'round with my heat tucked
Loud talk with that tough shit
Be the first nigga that'll freeze up
Project baby out the gutter nigga
Was takin' guns from my brother nigga
He came home, he ain't see his strap
A nigga trippin', gotta bring it back
Swear I dreamed of this lifestyle
All my people so proud of me
Fake niggas smile in my face
Back then wouldn't walk a mile for me
Moms told me to pay attention
Now my focus kind of fucked up
Couple people tried to take advantage
And they wonder why I don't trust much

[Chorus: Skooly]
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Skooly]
Come from the bottom, the bottom
Then straight to the top 'cause I seen that, look
I'm in this bitch on a bottle, then straight to the spot
Where the weed at? yeah
I kind of need that, them niggas ain't givin' no lean back
The bitches wasn't givin' no feedback
I married the game, where your ring at?
Uh, tell 'em the king back
I'm sippin' on mud with a mean pack
I'm drinking on red, I don't need Act
That little money, I don't need that
Go tell 'em the fiend back
I drink up the beat like it's lean, yeah
Money on me, know you seen that
Diamonds on me, I'ma gleam back, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Skooly]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Water is up on me
Diamonds in my motherfuckin' charm bling
Money is up on me
Bitch I came from nothin', I was starvin'

[Chorus: Skooly]
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
I had to go get it, I had to go get it, yeah
Oh yeah
