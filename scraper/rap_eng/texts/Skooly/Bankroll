[Verse 1]
Tweed and Dobie, in the kitchen, uh-huh
My brother died in the kitchen, uh-huh (okay)
Thirty on my extension, boom boom
Strapped up like I'm on a mission, nigga move (okay)
I put my mans on, I'ma let him call you
Now cut them fans on, dry that fucking dog food
And my nigga got them clips that make me bang like I do
And my bitch she got them lips that make me sang like I do
Okay I'm dressed up like my daddy, balling, but no Carlton
Singing like I'm fucking Marvin, this ain't no Marvin
You gon' need a fucking caution, I brought the mob in
Two-two-three, AK, PK, HK, SK, and carbines

[Chorus]
Bankroll got me still limping, mh-hmm
I'm still walking in the trenches, mh-hmm
And I'm out here still getting it, mh-hmm
And I'm out here still with it, mh-hmm
Bankroll got me still limping, mh-hmm
I'm still walking in the trenches, mh-hmm
And I'm out here still getting it, mh-hmm
And I'm out here still with it, mh-hmm (okay)

[Verse 2]
Bankroll busting out my pocket, I still wear a wallet, yeah
I don't trust nobody, I don't fucking trust nobody, uh
I only fuck with brothers and partners that keep it solid, hah
Shout out to my mama, I got it, I keep it solid
Now tell her I'm really sorry 'bout me not going to college
But tell you mama I got it, I promise mama I got it
This music got me on top
And these streets, they gave me my knowledge
And if I say I got it, then damn it, that mean I got it
I tell you I'm going get it, be patient we going shopping
My brother them still be robbing
And CostaNotra, we mobbing
I'm finally in the building, I get a piece of the pie
I'm sorry I'm not that phony, I'm sorry I'm not that guy
But fuck you

[Chorus]
Bankroll got me still limping, mh-hmm
I'm still walking in the trenches, mh-hmm
And I'm out here still getting it, mh-hmm
And I'm out here still with it, mh-hmm
Bankroll got me still limping, mh-hmm
I'm still walking in the trenches, mh-hmm
And I'm out here still getting it, mh-hmm
And I'm out here still with it, mh-hmm
