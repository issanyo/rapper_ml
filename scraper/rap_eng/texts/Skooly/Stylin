[Intro: Young Thug & Skooly]
(Why the fuck you)

Why? Why?
(Why the fuck you?)
Thugger Thugger
Ballin' on these niggas like that

Like that
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Skooly]

Wildin' on these bitches like that?
Stylin' on these bitches like that?
Why do you be
Wildin' on these niggas like that?
Stylin' on these bitches like that?
Wildin' on these bitches like that?

[Verse 1: Skooly]
I got this shit from my brother
He got it from dope in the water
Whip it on top of the water
Whip it on top of the oven
We never put shit in the oven
He never taught me 'bout microwaves
I spent my money on Michael J's
I got to be on that TIDAL page
You pussy niggas is not the same
Boy watch yourself, this is not your lane
Boy watch yourself, this is not your lane
You just a rookie, this not your game
We shootin' bullets that's stoppin' trains
We turn up fully and stop and aim
We turn up fully and stop and aim
Pop at your pussy ass, get your pussy ass
Make your pussy ass turn to pussy ass

[Chorus: Skooly]
Why do you be
Wildin' on these niggas like that?
Stylin' on these niggas like that?
Wildin' on these bitches like that?
Stylin' on these bitches like that?
Why do you be
Wildin' on these niggas like that?
Stylin' on these bitches like that?
Wildin' on these bitches like that?
Stylin' on these bitches like that?

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I was tryna fuck a nigga bitch (Thugga Thugga!)
I was tryna keep a nigga clean
I was tryna take her up the street
Now my diamonds dancin' nigga, G
There you, there it go, for the pesos
Got bitches climbin' my dick without no Lego
Nigga wildin' out in public, gotta lay low
Hundred bands make the judge say the case closed
Hundred thousand make the D.A. say the case old
Just like mothafuckin' old folks
Ya, I was shoppin' for the baby
Then she seen the jewelry way from outdoors
Nigga geeked up, heart got five beats
Like I'm David fuckin' Ruffin, ho
Yeah, you unique, but you still cheap
Young Skooly, tell me, why do you be...

[Chorus: Skooly]
Why do you be
Wildin' on these niggas like that?
Stylin' on these niggas like that?
Wildin' on these bitches like that?
Stylin' on these bitches like that?
Why do you be
Wildin' on these niggas like that?
Stylin' on these bitches like that?
Wildin' on these bitches like that?
Stylin' on these bitches like that?
