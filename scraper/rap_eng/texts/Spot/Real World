People talk about anarchy
And taking up a fight
Well I'm afraid of things like that
I lock my doors at night
I don't rape, and I don't pillage
Other people's lives
I don't practice what you preach
And I won't see through your eyes

You want to change the world
By breaking rules and laws
People don't do things like that
In the real world at all
You're not a cop, or a politician
You're a person too
You can sing any song you want
But you're still the same

I can't think of anything
That makes me more upset
People talk all this rhetoric
Forgive but not forget
I don't rape, and I don't pillage
Other people's lives
I don't practice what you preach
And I won't see through your eyes
