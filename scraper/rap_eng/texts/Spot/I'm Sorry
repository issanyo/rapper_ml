I'm no better than you
You're no better than me
Don't give me that bullshit
Just because we don't agree

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

It's become a case
What am I supposed to do?
Change the way I feel
Just because of you?

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
