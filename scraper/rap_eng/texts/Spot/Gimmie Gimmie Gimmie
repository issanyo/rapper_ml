[Hook]
Gimme gimme gimme
I need some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for
(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
Sitting here like a loaded gun
Waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do
But shoot my mouth off

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I gotta go out
Get something for my head
If I keep on doing this
I'm gonna end up dead

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I know the world's got problems
I've got problems of my own
Not the kind that can't be solved
With an atom bomb

[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
Sitting here like a loaded gun
Waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do
But shoot my mouth off

[Hook]
