I see that you're a policeman
I know you're in the Ku Klux Klan
You got a gun hung on your hip
It's underneath your silky slip

But we'll fight you
We'll fight
You're blue by day but white by night
Let's fight, oh let's fight

I know you'd kill me if you could
You hide your head beneath a hood
I know that you're a closet case
Afraid to show your fucking face

But we'll fight you
We'll fight
You're blue by day, and white at night
Let's fight! Oh let's fight, oh yeah!

I see that you're a policeman
And I know you're in the Ku Klux Klan
You got a gun hung on your hip
It's underneath your fucking slip

But we'll fight you
Yes we'll fight
You're blue by day, but white by night
Let's fight, oh let's fight, oh let's fight fight, oh let's fight fight, oh let's fight fight, oh let's fight fight
Tight!
