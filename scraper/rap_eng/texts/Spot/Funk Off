We're all free to do the things our man wants us to do
Push too far, they'll take your car and what belongs to you
There's a law that they can find to stop most anything
The pressure's here, the subtle fear will make you scream

People always getting stopped for stepping out of bounds
Don't give up just get back in and go another round
Don't give them what they expect, keep them on their toes
There's many things that we can do, here we go

(Party) I wanna party
I wanna party
I wanna party
All right!

We're all free to do the things our man wants us to do
Push too far, they'll take your car and what belongs to you
Don't give them what they expect, keep them on their toes
There's many things that we can do, here we go

(Let's get out of here)
