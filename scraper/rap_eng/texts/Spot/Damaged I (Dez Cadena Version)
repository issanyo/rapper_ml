Go!

Damaged! Stuck in my head, pushed by you
Fuck one of them, don't fuck with my head
With your, damage
Damage! Fuck with my mind you talk about
Damage, damage! Damage!
You look to the past
You try to see something
Your eyes are clouded
You don't see a thing, it fucks with your head
Oh shit!
It's damaged, damaged!
Fuck with your mind
So damaged!
Heart, damaged
Head, damaged
Seasick, damaged
Don't pray for your
Don't pray for mine
Don't pray for our
Damage! Damaged!

Shoot them guns
Go ahead son, it's just a cool
We don't need a new one
We'll just have the old one
Damaged! Damaged! Damaged!

It's rock damaged, rock damaged
Stuck in my brain
Pushed by me
Their rules, that I can't take
It's their rules, and to be their fate
They're damaged!
Damaged!
Damaged!
Stuck in my head
Damaged, don't pray for your
Don't pray for me
I need no prayer
I got
My head
Gonna keep it
Up there
I don't need
Your damage
Your shit
Your lies
It's all damaged
Damaged!
Damaged!
Damaged!

Their ideas are rank

It don't make

It just makes
