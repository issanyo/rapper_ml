I creep by moonlight
I hide when the sun starts to rise
I sleep with the dead things
I have holes instead of eyes
I have no heartbeat
No blood rushing through my veins
No nervous system
No impulses feeding my brain

I have no feelings
No remorse for stealing your child
You shouldn't have let her
Go wandering out in the wild
You've heard the legends
You know that I live out there
But in this modern world
It's foolish to believe in such a scare

I'm a zombie - my skin is now feeling away
I'm a zombie - my insides have died...
And turned grey

I'm lasting no shadows
And making no sounds you can hear
Fumbling through darkness
Your sweat's running cold from the fear
Searching my kingdom
No sign of your little girl
'cause free meals ain't wasted
Once they have entered my world

I creep by moonlight
I hide when the sun starts to rise
I sleep with the dead things
I have holes instead of eyes
I have no heartbeat
No blood rushing through my veins
No nervous system
No impulses feeding my brain
