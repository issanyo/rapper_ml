And don't forget that time
Is still ticking through halls
Pass doors like lines
(White lines on the freeway)

And don't forget that time
Is still ticking through halls
Pass doors like lines
(White lines on the freeway)

Stop like a roulette ball
Reach for the door beyond
There's a drawer
There's a drawer

Hope for hope is really a prayer
Hope for hope is really a prayer
Hope for hope is really a prayer
Hope for hope is really a prayer
