[Verse 1]
Wake up early, mad at you
Go to school, but where are you
You should've told me, I should've known
But now you're gone, and I'm alone

[Verse 2]
Your mother told me last night on the phone
Why'd you do it, now I'm alone
I would've helped you, would've done anything
Taken you with me, or bought you a ring

[Chorus]
Now you're gone, and I'm alone
Now you're gone, and I'm alone
You should've told me, I should've known
But now you're gone, and I'm alone

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]
Now you're gone, and I'm alone
Now you're gone, and I'm alone
Now you're gone, and I'm alone
Now you're gone, and I'm alone
You should've told me, I should've known
But now you're gone, and I'm alone
