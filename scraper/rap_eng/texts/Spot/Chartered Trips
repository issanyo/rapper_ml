I picked up my belongings
In a nylon carry-all
I hear the porter call

He said, "The sky's the limit
On this chartered trip away"
I guess I'd better stay

Out there on the desert
I see trees on every wall
Nothing's ever solved

He said, "The sky's the limit
On this chartered trip away"
I guess I'd better stay

I thought I owed myself a trip away
I wanted to go to places I have never been away
I looked at the pictures, imagine where they lay away
On a beach by the sand, where their clothes all lay away

I picked up my belongings
In a nylon carry-all
Hear the porter call

Horizon is oblivious
Chartered trip away
Guess I'd better stay

Out there on the desert
I see trees on every wall
Nothing's ever solved

Horizon is oblivious
Chartered trip away
I guess I'd better stay

I thought I owed myself a trip away
Wanted to go to places I have never been away
I looked at the pictures, imagine where they lay away
On a beach by the sand, where their clothes all lay away

I picked up my belongings
In a nylon carry-all
Hear the porter call

He said, "The sky's the limit
Chartered trip away"
I guess I'd better stay

He said, "There's no returning
On this chartered trip away"
He said, "There's no returning
Chartered trip away"
He said, "There's no returning
On this chartered trip away"
He said, "There's no returning
On this chartered trip away"
He said, "There's no returning
On this chartered trip away"
He said, "There's no returning
On this chartered trip away"
He said, "There's no returning
On this chartered trip away"
