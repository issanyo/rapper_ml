Well I see that you are a policeman
And I know you're in the Ku Klux Klan
And you got a gun hung up on your hip
And it's underneath your silky slip

We'll fight you
We'll fight
You're blue today, but white tonight
I wanna fight
I wanna fight

Well I know that you are a closet case
Yeah you're always afraid to show your face
Well I know you'd kill me if you could
And you hide your head underneath a hood

We'll fight you
We'll fight
You're blue today, but white tonight
I wanna fight
I wanna fight

Ah yeah yeah
Lemme tell you now

We'll fight you
We'll fight
You're blue today, but white tonight
I wanna fight
I wanna fight
I wanna fight
I wanna fight
I wanna fight
