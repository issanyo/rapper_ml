[Intro]
TV party tonight!
TV party tonight!
TV party tonight!
TV party tonight!

[Verse]
We're gonna have a TV party tonight (Alright!)
We're gonna have a TV party alright (Tonight!)

[Chorus]
We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

[Verse]
Everybody's gonna hang out here tonight (Alright!)
We'll pass out on the couch alright (Tonight!)

[Chorus]
We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

[Bridge]
Don't talk about anything else
We don't wanna know
We're dedicated
To our favorite shows

That's Incredible!
Hill Street Blues!
Dallas!
Fridays!

[Verse]
We sit glued to the TV set all night (And every night!)
Why go into the outside world at all? (It's such a fright!)

[Chorus]
We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

[Verse]
TV news shows what it's really like out there (It's a scare!)
You can go out if you want (We wouldn't dare!)

[Chorus]
We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

[Bridge]
Don't talk about anything else
We don't wanna know
We're dedicated
To our favorite shows

Saturday Night Live!
Monday Night Football!
Jeffersons!
Vega$!

[Verse]
I wouldn't be without my TV for a day (Or even a minute!)
I don't even bother to use my brain anymore (There's nothing left in it!)

[Chorus]
We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

[Verse]
Hey, wait a minute! My TV set doesn't work (It's broken!)
What are we gonna do tonight, this isn't fair! (We're hurtin'!)

[Chorus]
We've got nothing left to do
Left with no TV and just a couple of brews

[Bridge]
What are we gonna talk about?
I don't know!
We're gonna miss our favorite shows!

No That's Incredible!
No Monday Night Football!
No Jeffersons!
No Fridays!

No TV Party tonight
