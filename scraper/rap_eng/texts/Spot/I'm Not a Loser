[Verse 1]
Think that I'm a loser
Cause now my pants are too low
Think that I'm a slob
'Cause I got holes in my shoes
Think my cock is like
Just like my dirty shirt
Well you can fuck off
Cause I'm working sixty a week
You think that life is really tough
When your daddy won't buy you a brand new car
Take a girl out, she won't fuck you
You just bought her a gram of coke
Spent all your money on shitty coke

[Chorus]
I'm not a loser
That's right, I'm not a loser
I'm not a loser

[Verse 2]
Cruise down the boulevard wasting mommy's gas
While you're looking for some kicks on Friday night
You're only goal in life is to smoke a joint
And decide how you're gonna get laid tonight
You're a fucking son-of-a-bitch, you arrogant assholes
Your pants are too tight, you fucking homos
You suck, Mr. Buttfuck, you don't belong here
Go away, you fucking gay
I'm not a loser
