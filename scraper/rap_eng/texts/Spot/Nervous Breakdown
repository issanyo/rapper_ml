I'm about to have a nervous breakdown
My head really hurts
If I don't find a way out of here
I'm gonna go berserk
'Cause

I'm crazy and I'm hurt
Head on my shoulders
It's going berserk

I hear the same old talk, talk, talk
The same old lines
Don't do me that today
Yeah, if you know what's good for you
You'll get out of my way
'Cause

I'm crazy and I'm hurt
Head on my shoulders
Going berserk

I won't apologize
For acting outta line
You see the way I am
You leave any time you can
'Cause

I'm crazy and I'm hurt
Head on my shoulders
Going berserk

Crazy! Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
I don't care what you fuckin' do
I don't care what you fuckin' say
I'm so sick of everything
I just want to die!
