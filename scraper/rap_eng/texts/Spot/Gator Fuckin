Gator boys and gator girls
Living in an Izod world
A million clones, they're all the same
Rich little assholes with no brains

Gator fuckin boys
Gator fuckin girls
Gator fuckin you
Gator fuck the world

All the lives they've never seen
Protected in their little dream
They don't know what's going on
They don't know what's going wrong

Gator fuckin boys
Gator fuckin girls
Gator fuckin you
Gator fuck the world

Gator fuckin boys
Gator fuckin girls
Gator fuckin you
Gator fuck the world
