Not black or white
Not brown or yellow
It's green with might
Survives on fright

It's what I see
It's what I feel
It's what I taste

They own the land
We work the land
We fight their wars
They think we're whores

It's who they are
It's what they are
It's what I hate
It's what I feel
It's what I taste
