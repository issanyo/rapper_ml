We've been pushed around for much too long
The time for us is now, we must be strong
The pigs are always making a fuss
Always coming down, down on us

We'll get 'em back, we always do
Not the majority, we're only a few
They try to break us down to none
But we won't stop 'til our war is won

We fought and fought, killed the lot
Our lesson we learned, it was a lesson we taught
The heads we beat, the blood we feel
They don't fuck with us 'cause they know we're for real

Eventually we lie, lie on the ground
Many are dead but most are around
The position against is, now there is none
We rule now, our war is won
