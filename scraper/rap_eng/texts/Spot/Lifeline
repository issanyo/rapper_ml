I'm running out of time this time
This time I can't be late
I've got to find my destiny
Before it turns to fate

I feel so insecure, I feel so all alone
I need something, some posession of my own

I reach for what I want
I see it in my sleep
It's hard to get ahold of it
And it's twice as hard to keep

Someone help me lifeline

I grab the rope in front of me
It keeps slipping from my hands
I try to climb with all of my strength
But it trickles through like sand

This feeling's too secure, it's like a ball and chain
Yeah, I know there's something dragging in my brain

Now another rope appears
I've got it snug and tight
This is one that I can't let go of
No matter how I fight
