[Verse 1]
Love and hate was in the air
Like pollen from a flower
Somewhere in April time
They add another hour
I guess I better think up a way to spend my time
Just when I'm ready to sit inside, it's summertime
Should I go swimming or get a friend to hang around
It's back to summer, it's back to basics, hang around
Getting drunk out on the beach
Or playing in a band
And getting out of school
Meant getting out of hand

[Chorus]
Was this your celebrated summer?
Was that your celebrated summer?
Was this your celebrated summer?

[Verse 2]
Then the sun disintegrates
Between a wall of clouds
I summer where I winter at
No one is allowed there
Do you remember when
The first snowfall fell?
When summer barely had
A snowball's chance in hell?

[Chorus]
Was this your celebrated summer?
Was this your celebrated summer?
Was this your celebrated summer?
Summertime
Summertime
Summertime
Summertime

[Outro]
Do you remember when
The first snowfall fell?
Was that your celebrated summer?
