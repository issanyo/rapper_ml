Sometimes with people
I fake I've seen movies
To round off the edges

Subset of history
I lose my identity
Start bumming at parties

Prop up two tents
With one piece of rope
Fog-curtain inside me

Purge and reform
But admit that you fail
Start bumming at parties

Chasing the reasons
Refusing to reason
By listing the reasons
