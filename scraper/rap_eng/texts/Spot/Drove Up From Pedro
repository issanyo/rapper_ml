Now this Pedro dude had the attitude
But the 70's had him spaced up in Hollywood
Maybe then he could find a reason for his bass
Turned his Volkswagen, a spielwagon Hong Kong cafe

New years show, drove up from Pedro
From Pedro Watt drove
He had to get back to Pedro

Glad to chow on some squid
What the germs did at that gig
Made him do what he finally did
He fit the thunderbroom to the thundertune
Stuffed the thing in the hole

Drove up from Pedro, from Pedro he drove
Now he still live in Pedro

And for work he does gigs
But from time to time he seems to find
For inspiration he's got to dig
Back to them days when the germs played
Him and Joe Baiza at that show

Drove up from Pedro, from Pedro
Up from Pedro they drove
