[Instrumental Intro]

Beat my head against the wall one more time
Will this solve my problems at all?
I don't care about parties or a good time
I won't stand in your line

Swimmin' in the mainstream
Is such a lame dream
No method to the madness
Beat my head against the wall

Tension builds up so quickly
My judgment becomes affected
And without my even knowin' it
I have started to act like a bitch

Swimmin' in the mainstream
Is such a lame, lame dream
No method to the madness
Beat my head against the wall

[Instrumental Break]

Running around like a chicken without a head
Pardon me for bouncing around in bed
But the next day I'll still feel the same
I'll find a way to blast again

Swimmin' in the mainstream
Is such a lame, lame dream
No method to the madness
Beat my head against the wall
