I can't go to work
The boss is a jerk
I ain't got time for this school
The fuckers are fools

I'm going to explode
I've had it!

I lie around with the TV on
I don't do nothin'
I just hang around
Waitin' for your call
But I don't know where to fall

I'm going to explode
I've had it!

It's no use
I can't take no more abuse
I'm tired of the fuckin' lines
I'm losing my mind

I'm going to explode
I've had it!

Killin' all your dreams
Really who remembers?
I play guitar for my car
And I won't get very far

I'm going to explode
