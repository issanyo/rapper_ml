[Verse]
You think you're evil, but you're not
You've got your brain tied in knots
You live in guilt, your mind's not free
Nothing's wrong with you, you can't believe me
You think you're evil, but you're not
'Cause you will follow in a flock to believe
What they say about what you do, oh
When you just live your life, so what if you're not strong?
You think you're evil
The lights go out, you start to think
(whispers)
A pin dropped, I think you'll scream
You can hide beneath you're blankets
But you can't hide from your dreams
(whispers)
Demons fill your mind
Your body is possessed
You feel different from the rest
You think you're evil, but you're not
You've got your brain tied in knots
You live in guilt, your life's not free
Nothing's wrong with you, you can't believe me
You think you're evil, but you're not
'Cause you will follow in a flock
You think you're evil, but they don't really know
How you really are, but I know
You're not evil!
You don't know what it means
And everything you think makes me wanna scream
And it stays in your mind and comes out in a dream
You think you're evil, but you're not
You've got your brain tied in knots
You know your guilt, your mind's not free
Nothing's wrong with you, you can't believe me
You think you're evil, 'cause you can't see past
The wrong ideas that haunt your past
You think you're evil, but they don't really know
How you really are, but I know
You're not evil!
You don't know what it means
You can't see past, your hidden fears
Your whole life you dream in tears

You're not evil
