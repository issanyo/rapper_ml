We're gonna be a white minority
We won't listen to the majority
We're gonna feel inferiority
We're gonna be white minority

White pride: You're an American
I'm gonna hide
Anywhere I can

Gonna be a white minority
We don't believe there's a possibility
But you just wait and see
Gonna be white minority

White pride: You're an American
I'm gonna hide
Anywhere I can

Gonna be a white minority
There's gonna be large casualties
If we don't find a new territory
We're all gonna die
