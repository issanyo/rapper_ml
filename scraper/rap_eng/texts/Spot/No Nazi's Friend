I ain't no Nazi
Could if I wanted to
I ain't no Nazi
With all your fascist rules

I ain't no Nazi's friend
Could if I wanted to
I don't wear no uniform
Fight you like a mighty storm
I've got the rage in me
And that is part of it
I've got the rage in me
Fuck you like a mound of shit
Oh, yeah! Oh yeah
Oh yeah! Oh yeah

I ain't no Nazi's friend
Could if I wanted to
Don't wear no uniform
Fight you like a mighty storm
Oh, yeah!

I don't wear no uniform
Or I'd join the Houston Pigs
Just stop your racist slurs
Or your friends might find you dead

I ain't no Nazi's friend
Could if I wanted to
I don't wear no uniform
Fight you like a mighty storm
I've got the rage in me
And that is part of it
I've got the rage in me
Fuck you like a mound of shit
Oh, yeah! Oh yeah
Oh yeah! Oh yeah

I ain't no Nazi's friend
Could if I wanted to
Don't wear no uniform
Fight you, fight you, fight you yeah

I ain't no Nazi's friend
Could if I wanted to
I don't wear no uniform
Fight you
I ain't no Nazi's friend
Could if I wanted to
I don't wear no uniform
Fight you like a storm
Oh yeah! Oh yeah
Oh yeah! Oh yeah

I go yeah!
