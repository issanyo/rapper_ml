[Verse]
Time, time, time, forever time
It's time to walk by me one last time
It's time
At first, relax, get set
Get your message from time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time, forever time
It's time to look into my eyes one last time
It's time
I feel I'm some kind of death machine
With skin and muscles and a heart that pumps my blood
Time, time, time

Go ahead!

[Verse]
Time, time, time, forever time
It's time to kiss me goodbye one last time
It's time
This is the first time, this is the last time
It's my only time, but it's only time
Time, time, time, time
