[Verse]
Jealous cowards try to control
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
They distort what we say
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
Try and stop what we do
Rise above! When they can't do it themselves!

[Chorus]
We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us it's no use

[Verse]
Society's arms of control
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
Think they're smart
Can't think for themselves
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
Laugh at us
Behind our backs
I find satisfaction
In what they lack

[Chorus]

[Verse]
We are born with a chance
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
I am gonna have my chance
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Rise above
Rise above
Rise above
We're gonna rise above
We're gonna rise above
We're gonna rise above
