Keep me alive
Only you can do it
If not you'll die too and I'll see to it

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it

Keep me alive
I can't accept my fate
I need help
Before it's too late

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it

I need to belong
I need to hang on
I need, need

Keep me alive
Feelings I must obey
Can't turn my eyes from the past
This crisis is the last

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it

Keep me alive
I rely on your judgement
I've got none of my own
Don't know what I'm doing

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it

I need to belong
I need to hang on
I need, need

Keep me alive
Only you can do it

Keep me alive
Only you can do it

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it

Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it

I need to hang on
I need to belong
I need, need
