Talk about the problems and talk about the girls
Talk about the war and the end of the world
Talk about the boredom 'cause it's all around
Songs are just words that go with the sound

What can we do? Change it!
What can we say? Change it!
What can we do? Change it!
What can we say? Change it!

Religion sucks and so do all the rules
You just learn to fit in when you go to school
Rich people laugh while the poor people crawl
We try to talk and the pigs bust us all

What can we do? Change it!
What can we say? Change it!
What can we do? Change it!
What can we say? Change it!

Things are all falling, they walk down the line
Nobody's perfect, we're all serving time
Things all get built up just to fall down
A big fucking circle that always goes round

What can we do? Change it!
What can we say? Change it!
What can we do? Change it!
What can we say? Change it!
