[Verse]
Who are you with? Where have you been
Imagination streams thoughts, reason can't come in
Staring at the walls, I think I know what I see
Anger and coffee, feeding me

[Hook]
Drinkin' black coffee, black coffee
Drinkin' black coffee, starin' at the walls
Black coffee, black coffee, black coffee
Starin' at the walls, black coffee
Drinkin' black coffee, drinkin' black coffee
Starin' at the
Stab through my heart
Stab through my heart
Stab through my heart

But it's all in my mind, mind, mind, mind
It's just in my mind
It's just in my mind
Yeah!

[Verse]
My heart is pounding as I stare at the wall
It's my turn to be jealous; now, I don't stand so tall
In fact, I'm pretty stupid; I'm feelin' small
Anger and coffee, feeding me

[Hook x2]

[Verse]
As the night goes on, paranoia engulfs me
Why should I be so stupid when I can't really see
The other side of the wall is eating away at me
Anger and coffee, feeding me

[Hook]
