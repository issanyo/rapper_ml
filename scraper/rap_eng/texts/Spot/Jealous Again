You're jealous again
No, she's just a friend
Why can't I do anything without being yelled at?

Always on the phone
Never leave me alone!
Why don't you tell me what the fuck you want from me!

Say I'll never gonna leave ya
No, I'll never leave ya
Not the end
No, it's not the end

I won't beat you up
I won't push you around
'Cause if I do, the cops will get me for doing it!

I wanna go and have some fun
Go where the action is
Who the hell are you to tell me who my friends are!

Say I'll never gonna leave ya
No, I'll never leave ya
Not the end
No, it's not the end

Say I'll never gonna leave ya
No, I'll never leave ya
Not the end
No, it's not the end

You're jealous again
You're jealous again
You're jealous again
And again and again!
