Why did you back me into a corner?
I didn't mean it, it was just an act
My friend's outside, can't he come in?
And everybody else

Stupid pride
Selfish pride
Stupid pride

Why does everybody have to be like that?

"Out", just an act
His parents love him
They send him money
But he won't come back
No reaction, no response
Forget him, just forget him

No reaction, no response
Forget him, just forget him
