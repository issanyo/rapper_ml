I'm walking down the street and everywhere I go
Fools are always yelling- they won't leave me alone
You think you've got a right to scream and yell at me?
You never realize that what you do is wrong

Assault, assault
Assault, assault

Assault, assault
Assault, assault

Common sense tells you to mind your own business
You go out of your way to cause a scene
Why do they say the U.S.A. is the land of the free?
Don't tell me that my freedom is just another dream

Assault, assault
Assault, assault
