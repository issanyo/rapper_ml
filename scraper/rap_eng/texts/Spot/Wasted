I was so wasted

I was a hippie
I was a burnout
I was a dropout
I was out of my head

I was a surfer
I had a skateboard
I was so heavy man, I lived on the strand

I was so wasted

I was so fucked up
I was so messed up
I was so screwed up
I was out of my head

I was so jacked up
I was so drunk up
I was so knocked out, I was out of my head

I was so wasted

I was wasted
