[Verse 1]
Look out get out of my way
I'm going to the atomic cafe
I'm going to the atomic cafe
You're a mystery to me, kabuki girl

[Chorus]
Don't say sayonara I want to see you tomorrow
I want to see you tonight
You're a mystery to me kabuki girl

[Verse 2]
Your face is white
Your hair is black
You'll probably stab me in the back
But that's the chance I'm gonna take

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
East is east, west is west
Girls from the east are the best
They got more of what I'm lookin' for

[Verse 1]
