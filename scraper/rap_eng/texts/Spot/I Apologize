[Verse 1]
All these crazy mixed up lies, they're floating all around
Making these assumptions brings me down
And you get tight-lipped
How do I know what you think?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it something I said when I lost my mind?
My temper too quick, makes me blind

[Chorus]
I apolo-I apologize
I apologize
I apologize
Said I'm sorry, I
(Said I'm sorry, I)
Said I'm sorry
Now it's your turn, can you look me in the eyes
And apologize?
(How 'bout it?)

[Verse 2]
So now we sit around, we're staring at the walls
We don't do anything at all
Take out the garbage maybe, but the dishes don't get done

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it something I said when I lost my mind?
Temper too quick, makes me blind

[Chorus]
I apolo-I apologize
I apologize
I apologize
Said I'm sorry, I
(Said I'm sorry, I)
Said I'm sorry
Now it's your turn, can you look me in the eyes?
Apologize
(How 'bout it?)

[Verse 1]
All these crazy mixed up lies floating all around
Making these assumptions brings me down
And you get tight-lipped
But I know what you think!

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it something I said when I lost my mind?
My temper too quick, makes me blind

[Chorus]
I apolo-I apologize
I apologize
I apologize
Said I'm sorry
(Said I'm sorry)
Said I'm sorry
It's your turn, can you look me in the eyes?
Apologize!
(How 'bout it?)

[Outro]
I apologize, I apologize, I apologize
