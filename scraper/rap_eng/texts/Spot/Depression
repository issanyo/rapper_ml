[Verse]
Right here, all by myself
I ain't got no one else
The situation is bleeding me
There's no relief for a person like me

[Hook]
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression, I gotta break free
Depression's got a hold on me
Depression's gonna kill me

[Verse]
I ain't got no friends to call my own
I just sit here all alone
There's no girls that want to touch me
I don't need your goddamn sympathy

[Hook]
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression, I gotta break free
Depression's got a hold on me
Depression's gonna kill me

[Verse]
Everybody just get away
I'm gonna boil over inside today
They say things are gonna get better
All I know is they fuckin' better

[Hook]
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression, I gotta break free
Depression's got a hold on me
Depression's gonna kill me

Depression's got a hold of me
Depression, I gotta break free
Depression's got a hold on me
Depression's gonna kill me
