Ton of white boy guilt, that's my problem
Obstacle to joy - one reason to use some drugs

Slept on Mexican beach, slept in trash
American trash
Too much can ruin a good time

I asked a Mexican who ran a bar for Americans
"Who won" I said "the election?"
He laughed, I felt like a gringo
We paid for a song and they had some fun with us

Why can't you buy a good time?
Why are there soldiers in the streets?
Why did I spend the 4th in somebody else's country?
