Don't speak unless spoken to
And then you don't say much
You think you're so self-righteous
But your mind is out of touch

You're afraid, you're afraid of being wrong
Always be the passive one and go along
You're afraid, you're afraid to speak your mind
That's not for me, not for me, not for me

Living in a crystal maze
Fucked, you can't get out
Never be the agitator
Unless you know what it's all about
