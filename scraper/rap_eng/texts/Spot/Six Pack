[Intro]
I've got a six pack and nothing to do
I got a six pack and I don't need you

[Verse 1]
$35 and a six pack to my name
Six pack!
Spent the rest on beer so who's to blame
Six pack!
They say I'm fucked up all the time
Six pack!
But I know they're a waste of time
Six pack!

[Chorus]
I know it'll be OK
When I get a six pack in me
That's right!

[Verse 2]
My girlfriend asked me
Which one I like better
Six pack!
I hope the answer won't upset her
(Bitch)
Six pack!
I was born with a bottle in my mouth
Six pack!
Now I've got six so I'll never run out
Six pack!

[Chorus]
I know it'll be OK
When I get a six pack in me
That's right!

[Verse 3]
$35 and a six pack to my name
Six pack!
Spent the rest on beer so who's to blame
Six pack!
They say I'm fucked up all the time [Six pack!]
What they do is a waste of time [Six pack!]
Six pack! six pack! six pack!

[Outro]
What do they know about partying, or anything else
Hey! Where's the beer bong?
I need to get fucked!
