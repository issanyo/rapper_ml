This feeling haunts me
Behind these eyes
The shell seems so empty
Though I wonder if anything lives inside?

I want to live
I wish I was dead

My heart aches to bleed
I'm cheated from what I see
Freedom holds a double-edge for me
I look in your eyes and see...

I want to live
I wish I was dead

I don't want to think
I'm stuck here and I know it
I don't want to see
Make me close my eyes

I want to live
I wish I was dead

Life's cold
And it reaches inside
I need to feel
But turn my mind off
The desperation begins
From the start I see the end
Not right, I'm not right, you're not right
I've got to close my eyes

I look in your eyes
And see its always this way
Live the lie and take a dive
Just to make it die

I want to live
I wish I was dead
I've just got to close my eyes
I've got to close my eyes
I've got to close my eyes
