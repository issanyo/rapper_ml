Hands up in the air
Don't come near me, 'cause I can do it
Pull the trigger on this gun
End it now I swear it's coming

It's a statement, it's a fact
An idea, it's just ideas
You've got yours and I've got mine
I don't care, I do care

Hands up in the air
Don't come near me, 'cause I can do it
Pull the trigger on this gun
End it now I swear it's coming

It's a statement, it's a fact
An idea, it's just ideas
You've got yours and I've got mine
I don't care, I do care
I don't care, I do care
I don't care, I do care
I don't care, I do care
I don't care, I do care
