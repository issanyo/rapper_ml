[Verse]
This fucking city
Is run by pigs
They take the rights away
From all the kids

[Hook]
Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, No way

[Verse]
Walking down the street
I flip them off
They hit me across the head with a billy club

[Hook]

[Verse]
Nothing I do
Nothing I say
I tell them to go get fucked
They put me away

[Hook]

No fuckin' way
Motherfuckers gonna pay

[Verse]
I go to court for my crime
Stand in line, pay bail
I may serve time

[Hook]
