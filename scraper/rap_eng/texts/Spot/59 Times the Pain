The most intense of burning hells
Blasting expectations into smithereens
Never feeling normal, can't accept the truth
Resign myself to hating it, I hate it all

I can't say that I don't like it
Because the words won't come out right
All I feel is bitter, and it won't make it better

59 times the pain, I could never be like you
59 times the pain, I could never be with you
59 times the pain

Never figured out eating 3 meals a day
When the people sit in their broken-down homes
Look at the photos from different eras gone by
Shows the changes and I hate them all

I can't say that I don't like it
The words won't come out right
All I feel is bitter, doesn't make it better at all!

59 times the pain, I don't wanna be like you
59 times the pain, I could never be with you
59 times the pain

Don't want to live with myself
Can't live with what goes on
All I see is the humiliation
Wish it was gone

Can't say that I don't like it
Because the words won't come out right
All I feel is bitter, and it don't make it better

59 times the pain, I could never be like you
59 times the pain, I could never be with you
59 times the pain

59 times the pain, I could never be with you
59 times the pain, I could never be with you
59 times the pain
