White Stallions
(Chandler)

Yesterday I saw my face
Pictured in the sky
As I gazed upon myself
My whole life flashed by
I heard the sound of hoofbeats
From a thousand angry mares
Before I could control my thoughts
My inner soul was theirs

White stallions
In my vein
White stallions
Lord stop me
Before I go insane

Took me to the promised land
Where everything is free
Looked around and saw my friends
Laughing loud at me
A great stone wall divided us
On their side was a dance
On my side was endless torture
Guess I blew my chance

Only time can ease the pain
The stallions left behind
Tiny hoofprints on my arm
Strung out in a line
Wish that I could start again
And change my evil ways
Trapped upon the stallion's back
'till my dying days
