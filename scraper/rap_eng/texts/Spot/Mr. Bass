[Verse 1]
Mr. Bass lies waiting in his kelpy room
Waiting, 'til comes doom
He comes and then he goes
He sees Orca and then he knows

[Chorus]
I can see Mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can feel Mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can taste Mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can smell Mr. Bass, tomorrow

[Verse 2]
We finished the island with a broken motor
We went knockin' on the bass' door
They were biting at alarming rate
Mr. Bass, he was irate

[Chorus]
Mr. Bass takes a beating
Billy Boy must keep eating
Old Pat, he must be burning
Look's like his stomach's turning
He feeds on the centipedes
He lies behind in a greenish hue
He'll eat whatever, he'll even eat you
Mr. Bass, he knows my hook
Cause I've been reading them bassin' books

[Chorus]
