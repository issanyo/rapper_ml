[Verse 1]
Do you know what I think about you
Do you know what I feel is true
Do you know what I think about her
I know what she thinks about me, Iâ€™m sure

[Chorus]
Don't know why it's so, but it's true

[Verse 2]
So you know what I think about you
But do you know what you want me to do
When you see me staring at you
Do you know what I want you to do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I don't want to have sex with you
I want to be your friend
I want to be with you
I want you to marry me

[Verse 4]
So you know what I think about you
You know that my speed is you
I know I want you to be my wife
And stay with me the rest of your life
Do you know what I think about you
