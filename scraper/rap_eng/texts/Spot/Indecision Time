Questions like a candle that's burning at both ends
Never find an answer that fits in your plans
Back and forth between the good and the bad it's indecision time
You're so natural, you're so free
So don't decide what's best for me

Nothing in your life is ever going on course
You wonder if living could be much worse

Go to the left, go to the right
Your mind is going to keep you up all night
You twist in your sleep, grabbing the sheets, sweating to death

Sucking on pollution like a rattle in your mouth
You're a big fucking kid, you don't know what you're about

Tell me about your fellow man
You wipe their shit all over your hands
