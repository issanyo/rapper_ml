Oh, listen
Oh, listen
You must be deaf you never hear a single word that I say
And still you look at all the facts and then you don't see anyway

Hear what you will
See what you will
Say what you will
That's not my problem
Hear what you will
See what you will
That's not my problem
You never listen anyway

Oh, listen
Oh, listen
You miss so much, I know it just can't be me
And still you insist, why can't you see?

Hear what you will
See what you will
Say what you will
That's not my problem
Hear what you will
See what you will
That's not my problem
You never listen anyway

Oh, listen
Oh. listen
There's no point
In going on with this game
No winners, no losers
Always the same
