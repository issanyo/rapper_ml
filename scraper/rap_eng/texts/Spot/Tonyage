[Verse 1]
You beat up Fear's bass player
You were all surfers last year
3 years ago it wasn't cool
You spit on me, but I'm no one
Hey, Bobby Pyn had long hair
But you spit on Darby Crash
He had a fucking mohawk man
3 years ago, forming in 1975

[Verse 2]
I'm a new waver
My girlfriend's a surfer
She's more cool than you are
She won't fuck you anyways
Eh, it dosen't matter, you all suck
You don't know shit about punk rock
You're just a bunch of fucking drug addicts
Screwing up what we call fun

[Verse 3]
I hate everything, that means you
I hate you more than I do
I got no time to sleep, no time to get laid
I'm sick in love, I'm too in love

[Outro]
Fake hardcore
You're fake hardcore
You spit on The Urinals
