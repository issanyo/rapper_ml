[Intro]
Swinging man, swinging man, swinging man, swinging man, swinging man
Hanging around, hanging around, hanging around, hanging around

[Verse]
I'm the swinging man
And my feet never touch the ground
Never touch the ground
I'm swinging man, swinging man, swinging man, swinging man
I swing back and forth
Back and forth
Back and forth
Back and forth
I was looking for a little warmth
But I didn't find nothin'
So now I'm hanging around
Swinging man hanging around
Swinging man feeling no pain
Feeling no pain
Feeling no pain
No pain
No pain
All the girls know my name
I go by swinging man
Swinging man
Swinging man
I tell you what, you get yourself together
And you go downtown, you come on home
And I'll still be hanging around
Because I'm the swinging man
And my feet never touch the ground
I am the swinging man
And my feet never touch the ground
Feeling no pain
No pain
If you love me, you'll cut me down
But if not, I'll still be hangin' around 'cause
I'm the swinging man
And my feet never touch the ground
I am the swinging man
Swinging man, swinging man, swinging man, swinging man
