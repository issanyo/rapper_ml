[Verse]
My ghetto My ghetto My ghetto My ghetto, My ghetto
My ghetto gets desperate and it drags you in
You see me with that black dog
You know that's when you walk into my ghetto
Cause its Hungary and no ones let in
My ghetto gets jealous and it invites you in
You walk into my ghetto
My ghetto sucks in sad bad trash slaps you on the back
And says howdy glad you could come on down
My ghettos gonna treat right
The sunshine rolls in with bad timing
My ghetto gets horny and it sucks you in
Cause were all tripped out and no ones let in
My ghetto gets desperate and it drags you in
Think white trash think white trash
And if I cried over love a thousand times
Stay with me, stay with me
For a moment, For forever
Cause I've got nothing
And I'd give it all to you
