[Verse]
No, I won't believe that this is all
I'm not happy, I'm not free
Pay check to pay check, living for what?
Every night I get drunk to get sunk

[Hook]
I need action
Won't take no more
No more, no more, no more
It won't work, won't work no more

[Verse]
I knew what I had when I grew up
I know that it really sucked
Now I'm a slave to the same lies
If I don't get out I'm gonna die

[Hook]

[Verse]
Control, control for who, for what?
I'm no robot
They can get fucked
Reaction's masochism this can't last
I need to live, I need it now

[Hook]
