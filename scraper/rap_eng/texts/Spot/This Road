Framing like a box
Explaining now, explaining then
Like a bubble on a sheet in flames
Then to as dense as wet as cotton swabs

For a time, then dabble in formula
Return to explain, conscience is a smokey
Get out of hand, get pulled over
Go back

Framing like a box
Explaining now, explaining then
Like a bubble on a sheet in flames
Then to as dense as wet as cotton swabs
