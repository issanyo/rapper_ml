[Verse 1]
I like food, food tastes good
I like food, food tastes good
Juicy burgers, greasy fries
Turkey legs and raw fish eyes
Teenage girls, with ketchup too
Get out of my way, or I'll eat you

[Verse 2]
I like food, food tastes good
I like food, food tastes good
Gonna turn dining back into eating
I like food, food tastes good
I like food, food tastes good
