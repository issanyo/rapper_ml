Fantasies are over now
Yours is not the only way
Accept that there's some other views
And leave if you don't want to stay

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What's the matter? Are you scared
Your stance may not be so strong?
Get rid of the competition
Easier to prove them wrong
Worried about your so-called "image"
It's the way then what's to fear?
Give you an alternative
Only if you come in here

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fantasies are over now
Yours is not the only way
Accept that there's some other views
And leave if you don't want to stay
