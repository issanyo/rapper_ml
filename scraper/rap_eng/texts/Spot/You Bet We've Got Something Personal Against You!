You don't have anything against me do you?
You bet I've got something personal against you!

We know
You stole our song
You were there
Every touch in wrong
You were there
Fuckin' wrote it all down
You invent
Everything you've done
Now you bet that I've got something personal against you!
You deny
All the sleaze and graffiti
You inflect
You look from our path
It's minus and you're impossible laps
We know
What you've been lyin' about
Now you bet that I've got something personal against you!
You deny
Sitting at the corner
You die
But the love of your own
You've got nowhere to go but down
