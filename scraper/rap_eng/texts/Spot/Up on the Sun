[Verse 1]
A long time ago
I turned to myself and said
You, you are my daughter

[Hook]
I saw that the image
I saw it was real
So you are my daughter
Then maybe we've got something to talk about

[Verse 3]
Who told you so
That gold burns slow
Like coal camper's candles
All lost in the snow

[Hook]
Now you are my daughter
Then maybe we've got something to talk about

[Bridge]
Lay down, you're on
The warmth that I'm weaving
Is for you alone

[Chorus]
Up on the sun
Where it never rains or snows
There's an ocean
With a wind that never blows
And if you see it closer
Then the finer points will show
Not too much more
Too much more
