[Verse]
There was a girl I knew
She saw the prison inside
She cursed her keeper
And swore she'd get free
Every time I see
I got my hands
Wrapped around
The Bars
I want out
Right now
She led an angel's life
On angel wings
Jumped out her
Apartment window
And hit the street below
Every time I see
I got my hands
Wrapped around
The Bars
I can't shut off
My mind
And now
I've waited
My hands
Are wrapped around
The Bars

[Hook]
I'm burning
My soul
Is pushed against
The Bars
The Bars
The lie
The lie
The lie
The lie
Lie

[Verse]
The jail
Behind my eyes!
My mind hates my body
My body hates my soul
I close my eyes and fight
Inside my own black hole
Every time I see
I got my hands
Wrapped around
The Bars
I want out
Right now
I've lived my life
I'm doing my time
I realize
Lifeâ€™s lie
Every time I see
I got my hands
Wrapped around
The Bars
I can't shut off
My mind
And now
I've waited
My hands
Are wrapped around
The Bars

[Hook]

[Verse]
The prison
Behind my eyes!
Every time I see
I got my hands
Wrapped around
The Bars
I can't shut off
My mind
And now
I've waited
My hands
Are wrapped around
The Bars

[Hook]

[Outro]
The prison
Behind my eyes!
