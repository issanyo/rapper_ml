[Verse 1]
I'm not a punk, how can I be
Show me the way to conformity
Try to be different, but it's always the same
End up playin' someone else's game

[Chorus]
I'm just a square goin' nowhere
I'm just a square goin' nowhere

[Verse 2]
You used to walk by my side
Now you see me comin', now you hide
I see you here, I see you there
I can see that you don't care

[Chorus]

I'm just a square goin' nowhere
I'm just a square goin' nowhere
I'm just a square goin' nowhere
I'm just a square goin' nowhere
I'm just a square goin' nowhere
I'm just a square goin' nowhere
