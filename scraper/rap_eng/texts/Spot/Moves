I used to stay in my bag all the time, I didn’t know what to do

Now I don’t stay in my bag anymore, I be out looking for moves

Remember when everybody used to doubt me

They used to put me on snooze

They treated me like a fool

But through it all, I kept my cool

I knew that bitches would try to distract me
I knew that niggas would hate

People will always talk behind your back, they will never talk to your face

I ain’t come from the richest or poorest, but fam was on section 8

I won’t stop grinding till I make sure my whole family straight

End of hook—


Verse 1:

There were times when girls dubbed me ‘cause I wasn’t winning

My girl, she down for me winning or losin

My shorty know that I fuck with her heavy ‘cause she never chosey

In class, I’m real quiet, they don’t know what I be thinking

Teachers all on me tryna ask what I’m doing

Stay on my dick tryna make me look stupid

Told Mrs.Chiota bitch please stop assumin


I’m blind as hell, but I have a good vision
Graduate high school, and then go to college
Lead by example for my younger siblings
I gotta make sure that they get out the trenches


Mentally, I gotta keep a clear vision

You know it stay 20 20

My pockets stuffed with all twenties
I look like a lick but nobody gon’ touch me

I’m Livin life like I’m in a movie
I just need millions, Montgomery Brewster

Aye, aye, aye

Girls never messed with me, called me a loser

Aye aye aye

Now they be textin my phone. They be choosing

My shorty bad and she really bougie

When I get a check imma drip her in Gucci


They wanna see me lose
They don’t wanna see me win
I gotta watch who I’m with

I gotta watch what they doing

‘Cause you know I can’t get PUT in the pin
So you know I can not do nothing foolish

They tryna copy my movements
So I don’t tell them nothing I be doing

End of verse 1

Verse 3:

And you tryna hop on the wave?

And you tryna be me, but nigga you ain’t

My drip is different

Our drip not the same

Plus you can’t handle my wave, it’s not safe

Look at my belt, you can tell it’s not fake

Im getting money, you can not relate

Im getting money you can not relate

Honestly I am so smooth!

They know as soon as I hope in the booth, my words be aw man...
