Heavy metal wings
Shining in the night
Every inch is prepared
For kamikaze flight
The machines are faster
And the bombs are worse
As we're all sucked into
This unholy curse

War is our destiny

There's a thousand armies
Dressed up with nowhere to go
All ready to dance
In the final show
These men aren't bad men
They're like you or me
The only thing that's different
Is their destiny

We both sign treaties
And they always die
Neither side can give us
A good reason why
They're always talking louder
And now we are too
Guess we both bit off
More than we could chew
