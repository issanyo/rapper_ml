On a date with Sharon Tate
I'm gonna pick her up in my new crate
Well we go to the movies, we go to the drag
The highway patrol puts us both in a bag

Wheels, wheels

Statue of Mary sitting on my dash
Mother, please protect me
Help me avoid the crash
I've got a really big engine
And it goes vroom, vroom
Could be a cradle, could be a tomb

Wheels, wheels

Wheels
