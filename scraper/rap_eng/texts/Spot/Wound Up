[Verse]
I walk by your house
To see if you were at home
It was my only chance
I felt so alone
It always seems
I get so wound up
To feel so let down

[Hook]
I get so wound up
I feel so let down
I get so wound up
I feel so let down
I get so wound up
I feel so let down
I get so wound up
Don't you ever see the way I look at you?
Could you understand why I feel the way I do?

[Verse]
I have a lot to show you
Feel I have something to prove
There's things I'd like to tell you
My brain is slow to move
I wish you'd give me a second
So I could make you see
That no one in the world could look at you
And see the things I see

[Hook]

[Verse]
I have strong emotions
I keep them to myself
I know I can write them
I know I can sing them
That's what I'll have to do
Because in my heart
Deep in my heart
I keep a picture of you
