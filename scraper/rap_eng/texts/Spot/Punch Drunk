Take a look around this bar
Take a look around this place
Take a look around this hall
Think it's a fucking gym?

Kick and punch and kick and punch and
Kick and punch and kick and punch
Who's your friend? Who's your friend?
Who's your friend? Who's your friend?
Your enemy

Take a look around this bar
Take a look around this place
Take a look right in the mirror
What are you a fucking queer?

Kick and punch and kick and punch and
Kick and punch and kick and punch
Who's your friend? Where's your friend?
He's over there
He's gonna fuck it up for everybody

Kick and punch and kick and punch and
Kick and punch and kick and punch
Who's you friend? Who's your friend?
Where's your friend?
I guess he'd rather be punch drunk
