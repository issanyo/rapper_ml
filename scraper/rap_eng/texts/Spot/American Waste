The worlds got some plans for me
Courthouse, jails and factories
Black and whites on the street
For me for me

I see my place in american waste
Faced with choices I can't take
American waste american waste
On my own I see my fate

On my own on the way out
Small enough it's all spelled out
I know what I see what I want
The doors are closed in this maze

I see my place in american waste
Faced with choices I can't take

American waste american waste
On my own I see my fate

Boredom looks for it's kicks
Going down on death
I see it coming
I can't do anything

Not for me not for me
I won't end up in the heap
I want out I'm free
Burning burning

I see my place in american waste
Faced with choices I can't take
American waste american waste
On my own I see my fate
