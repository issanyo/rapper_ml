She my party girl, white girl wasted/
She a gong show, yup, here's a hit, baby take it - ahh/
How that feel, baby girl we high/

Ditch ya' man, he a lame, can I sub in for a second?/
I'm flirtin' with bad bitches like I did it in detention - and she mentioned/
"Oh my fuckin' god, look at Spot and Ess!"/
Gangsta bitch, wanna pop some X/
With her nine out, she wanna pop my ex/
Ashley, Mary Kate, two queens, and they triple ace/
Full house, I'mma win
Today, ménage à trois, I'mma hit it babe/
Paris Hil, Lindsay Lo, Dom Pérignon, she sip it slow/
Get in the coupe, get in the door, go for a "Cruise", take Katie home (Holmes)/
My ride or die like Left Eye, right hand on her left thigh/
She like that in the X5, Beamer, that's what I call sex drive/
That Louis shit, Gucci shit, she take it off like a nudist bitch/
Romeo and Juliet, them George A. Romero movie sets/
Ain't a home wrecker, I demolish that shit/
Got a quarter of a bottle left, polish that shit/
Y'all sayin' you love eachother, made her promise that shit/
Now she cheatin', and she tweetin', "Oops, oh my - whoo girl, what a weekend!"

Look... I say if you don't give that ass up you gon' have to owe me/
And if you say my name they gon' tell you that's the homie/
Girl I heard you got it, but you gon' have to show me/
Everywhere you go you can tell 'em that you know me/
I'mma have that O.E. mixed up with that lime - ah/
She don't mess with that malt liquor she fixed up with that wine - ah/
She finished that bottle, now its time for them shots - shots/
I swear this girl is fire I should stop, drop, let's roll/
Cause she my party girl, come on let's party girl/
She said "Why ain't you call?" I said I'm sorry girl/
I said I been busy girl, I said I meant to girl/
You keep on sweating me, but I'mma let you girl/
Because that ass so big - ass so big/
Make a young man wanna have your kid/
But if I do that, half your shit/
Them white girls telling me I rap so sick/
That's no shit, shiiit/

My team so popular/
It's that Three Six, no mafia - I'm just sayin'/

Ay, are you faded girl?

What up tho, shit is cut-throat/
Type that don't ever give a fuck tho/
And bitches love me to the utmost/
So that's rose pedals in my blunt smoke/
Commas, zeroes, more dollars/
Same way I chase my vodka/
Temper like her dad but her waist like her mama/
Gold chains, gold rings, that's her armor/
Bitter over love, bitter over life/
Bitter over bitches that'll never be a wife/
Wanna cop a benz, then you better know the price/
Cause my homies in the bank like we pulling off a heist/
With Polo tees I'm buyin'/
Fresh shit - no crease, no iron/
Bitches that's known for lyin'/
Overseas man she be flyin'/
Just to get that D inside 'em/
Anything for E inside 'em/
Bust a nut, then we deny 'em/
Shit, Spot and Ess man we be smilin'/
All up in her hair like the scent of the indo/
Spent dough, top down like the windows/
Pop pills, vitamins - that's Flinstones/
Bam Bam boy, did it for my kinfolk/
Uh - more heart than the Hitman/
Hennessy got her leanin' like a kickstand/
No guitars but she sick with the licks fam/
Sundays in my palm like a Christian/

(GRAFIC)
Yeah I had this awesome chick, that always did some awful shit/
One night she got so tossed and blitzed, sniffin' cocaine off my dick/
Breathe baby, exhale/
A couple shots, get some weed and some X pills/
So give me the party girls, the ones that don't have any care/
The ones that take they clothes off and say you can put it anywhere/
I can put it anywhere? "You can put it anywhere"/
No need to tell me twice, I'm ready - yeah/
I had this Christian chick, who was messed in the head/
Always preaching to me about heaven and hell/
I told that bitch shut the fuck up, and get in the bed - and stop/
Spreading the word and start spreading your legs, bitch!/
