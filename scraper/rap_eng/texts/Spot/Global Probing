It takes a long time to get what you want
No matter how hard you try
It just won't come
But you keep on tryin'
And you don't give up
And it's really silly
And it's all in vain
And if you don't stop you're gonna go insane

Cause it takes a long time to get what you want
No matter how hard you try, it just won't come
But you keep on tryin
And you don't give up
And it's really silly
And it's all in vain

And you could be doing other things
You could be doing what you want
But you keep on tryin'
And you don't give up
And it's really silly
And it's all in vain
And if you don't stop you're gonna go insane
It's all in vain
And if you don't stop you're gonna go insane
It's all in vain
And if you don't stop you're gonna go insane
Insane, insane, insane, insane
It's all in vain
And if you don't stop you're gonna go insane
