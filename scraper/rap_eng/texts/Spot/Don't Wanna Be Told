Don't wanna be told
About my life
Get in the wake of a bit of my knife

Today at school
The shit they teach
I'll bet they jest at the life they preach
Don't wanna be told, don't wanna be told
I don't wanna be told what to do

The next job
Minimum wage
Tourettes gets me in a rage
Don't wanna be told, don't wanna be told
I don't wanna be told what to do

Don't wanna be told
What to do
Not by you or you or you or you
