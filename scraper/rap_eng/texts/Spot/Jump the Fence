The sound I'm hearing
Should not be spoken
It enters my mind
All rules are broken
It's the voice of reason
Speaking as my conscience
There will be some treason
Same old sort of nonsense

Ambivalence
I always jump the fence

Look at the good things
Not good for long
I thought I had it
I was all wrong
But now my mind is made up
Everything is final
Until the time I change it
There is no denial

Ambivalence
I always jump the fence
All right!

You want to want
One step removed
To have, to have
To be improved
But now if doubt is out
And intuition is in
In an instant out of instinct
I'll start all over again

Ambivalence
I always jump the fence
