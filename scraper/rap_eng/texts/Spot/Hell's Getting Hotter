I feel the streets tonight
Nowhere left to go
My nights are full of losers
The world's big talk, a sad freak show
The air's not fit to breathe
Walls a step away
We're up to our necks in water
And Hell keeps getting hotter, right!

I feel the streets tonight
Nowhere left to go
My late nights are full of losers
The world's big talk, a sad freak show
The air's not fit to breathe (cough cough)
Walls a step away
We're up to our necks in water
And Hell keeps getting hotter, right!

In Hell
See you all in Hell
And you can go to Hell for all I care
Pretty soon you'll learn, one in all
We don't burn
