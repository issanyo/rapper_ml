[Verse 1]
Got your Jourdache jeans
Got your pretty long hair
Dinner and a movie, powder your nose
Take their honey for a lay
Just like pay
You're just a human being on this planet
You're just flesh and blood like all the rest
You'll get old and have a wrinkled ass

[Verse 2]
Humans are shit, I want to be a bear
I want to shit in the woods
In my cave hunt my prey
Could be you, I want to have food
Burgers not berries
Ladies are women but women are ladies
Got a baited hook
You are calling it your cherry
You want to settle down
And you want to get married
I don't want to smell your muff
