Everybody wants to know
Where you get off
Thinking that you're bad because
You praise the dogs
Satan's evil you had
Better stay away
Or else with your stupid soul
You will have to pay

You wear your crosses upside-down
It shows that you're a fool
You don't realize
What he's got in store for you

The flames of hell
Burn eternally
They never die
You must think it will be fun
To forever fry

You scorn the good book laugh at me
Say I am an ass
But I'll have the final chuckle
When judgement's passed
I may not rise right away
I am not that pure
But I know I won't follow you
And that is for sure

Prayer for the masses
Pray for their asses
