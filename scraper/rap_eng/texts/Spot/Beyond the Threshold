It's a one-horse town
One big desert
Asphalt desert
Asphalt jungle

Beyond the threshold
Beyond the threshold

Change for the worse
Change nonetheless
Hey, hey, hey
Got no place to stay

Beyond the threshold

I hear machines
They burst at the seams
But tar and feather
All stick together

Beyond the threshold
Beyond the threshold

Greetings from home
I wish you were here
Hear what I say but
You can't hear me at all

Beyond the threshold
Beyond the threshold
Beyond the threshold
Beyond, beyond, beyond
