[Verse 1]
Well the people walk all around
The thing on an island very far from here
They pay it homage like a god
And they paint it on each and every year
A sign for all it was given to us
And we all appreciate this bomb
The tourists don't know and never will
It has no use it's meaning is gone

[Chorus]
The Statue of Liberty
And for united we stand
We all agree, it's a mystery
But why'd they give it to us

[Verse 2]
We still don't know just why it came
A present from God or by the rain
The crowds swarm wildly to see it's peak
When I watch I go insane
Why is it so important to them
What is the beauty they see in it
I don't know why I just accept it
I don't want it, cause it makes me sick

[Chorus]
