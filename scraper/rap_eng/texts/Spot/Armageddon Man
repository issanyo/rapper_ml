Yea

Nowhere to go
No place to go
I'm real screwed up
My eyes are sore from smoking all that shit
No place to go
Bottomless heart, so big that everything just gets lost in there
And if it never comes out, that's okay by me
And on other side, at the top there may light at the end of the tunnel
I just don't think I'll be the same
I'm just warning you
I'm warning you all
No crutches, no nothin'
I am going to live the end
Apocalypse man
What the hell else is there to do
I want a mission
Not a gig or a good time, I want a mission
Scrawny stiff legs and despair come walkin my way with an achy step
Shipwrecked souls, desolation paradise
Bountiful wonderland of lost souls staggering around arms out stretched looking
For something lonely hero man sitting on the crest of the apocalypse
And our boy says something like uh
Hey sir, I'm a man away from home, and my soul is out on loan
Could you throw us down a bone, so I wouldn't be all alone
Cause I wanna see it all, and I wanna have it all, and I wanna see it fall
And I wanna take it all away
February 13th
Birthday new shirt around my neck
Shivers up and down my spine
The time is mine and I'm feelin fine
And I take this one thin dime
And I call my mom on the phone and say
Say something to warm her heart
Say uhh your boy done fucked up
Had a bit of hard luck, went down a wrong trail, messed with the wrong people
And just lost his mind just lost his mind just lost his mind
Just lost his mind just lost his mind just lost his mind just lost his mind
Jumped! get stuck in the trunk, got stuck in the jungle
And their jokes and their votes and their wrong side looks, and all the notes in the books
And all the wrong turns and all the bad burns
And he never learned to not get burned and he never learned
One more wrong turn led to another wrong turn
Dog people! These people are for real, they watch television
They run in circles, they bark like dogs, they nip at my heels
They wanna put a collar around my neck, they want me to be like them
Well I just walk right past, right over 'em, right though 'em, right on top of them
I crush their face 'cause it's easy, 'cause they're nothing. 'cause they're nothing
Little dogs, humping dogs, sticking that thing in any crack that passes by
Dirt falling in my mind, dirt gets stuck in my mouth, dirt gets stuck in my eyes
Seeing everything through dirt, all I see is dirt, all I know is dirt just talking dirt
Talking dirt, Digging dirt, loving dirt, rolling in dirt
Dirt river, dirt slithers, dirt lovers, dirt undercover, dirt over color
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah
I've felt dirty before, but it never felt quite like this
I've seen dirt before but it never looked quite looked like this
I've talked dirt before but it never sounded quite like this
That's not the way it is that's just the way it is around here around these parts
Ooo!
It took a long time to make a long rhyme
It took a long time to make a story short
It took a lotta lives and a lotta lies to make this story what it is
And stretch it into a disgusting distortion and proportion and detail
And you can retail that, and sell it to the market and see what you get
Bring back the proceeds and we'll spend it on something of worth
Something that will save me, something that will get me out of here
There's nothing I want more like out
There's nothing I like to roll in like dirt look!
Ashamed of myself I've looked at myself I've hated myself
And if we could all just get together and hate a little we could hate one another
Hate our sisters and brothers in the sea of disunity
Get my fill when the blood spills
Get my fill when the blood spills
Get my fill when the blood spills
I get my freeze with the chill spells
I get my thrills with the cheers feel
I get my thrills with the cheers feels
The glass breaks
Chills up and down my spine and I'm feeling fine
I was feeling fine, the time is mine
Spending time to time getting my beer and all the gulls wing inside my head
And alarms going on and off
All fucked up
All messed upâ€¦
Open my eyes, too much breathing
Too much of that fucking dirty air makes me talk shit makes me live shit
Makes me wanna kiss the ground, better than kissing you dirt girl, in that dirt dress
What's up that dirt dress what's up that dirt dress ain't nothing but a bunch a trash
Ain't nothing but a bunch a trash ain't nothing but a bunch a trash
Ain't nothing but a bunch a trash, but you seem to have me quite interested
Quite interested, I think I'll walk your way, I think I'll say your name
I think I'll come over to your house
Eeeuw you got something for me you got something for me
I'm the man among men walking tall with a plan
You can send it around the world, you can hold it in your hand
You can bring it on home, I'm Armageddon man girl
Armageddon man girl, armageddon man girl
And I want the whole world I want the whole world I want the whole world
I wanna make this place a better place and send my shovel and face everywhere
A statue of my effigy
They erected a slum in my name
Henry Rollins memorial slum
Henry Rollins memorial pit
Got a grave with my name I gotta grave that always looks the same
Through the eyes of a fucking bug
