Damaged by you
Damaged by me

I’m confused. Confused. Don’t wanna be confused
Stupid attempts, no conclusions
I’m confused. Confused. Don’t wanna be confused
Put the gun to my head, and I don't pull

I’m confused. Confused. Don’t wanna be confused
Don’t even feel a thing. No I don’t wanna see
But you can't make me long for your life and security
Don’t even feel a thing. No I don’t wanna see
But you can't make me long for your life and security
Problems stick, my life drips
Feelings… stupid feelings
Stupid illusions

I’m confused. Confused. Don’t wanna be confused
Scars. AAAAARRRRGGGHHHHHHHH!
I’m confused. Confused. My emotions are bruised
Wrong in what you think. You don’t feel shit

I’m confused. Confused. Don’t wanna be confused
Don’t even feel a thing. Don’t even wanna see
But you can't make me long, for your life and security
Don’t even feel a thing. Don’t even wanna see
But you can't make me long for your life and security
Problems stick, my life drips
Feelings… start
Aaaaahhhhhhh!

I’m confused. You’re wrong. Don’t wanna be wrong
Stupid incompetence. Stupid in what you think
I’m confused. Leave me alone. I don’t wanna be wrong
When I talk to you my mind falls apart

I’m confused. Confused. Don’t wanna be confused
Don’t even feel a thing. No I don’t wanna see
But you can't make me long, for your life and security
(Problems… my problems)
No longer feel a thing. Don’t even wanna see
But you can't make me long for your life and security
Problems stick, my life!
Feelings… everything I know
