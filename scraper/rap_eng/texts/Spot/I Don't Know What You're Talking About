You're a student of the world, learning every day
Surrounded by these walls
You tell me, "Man, I've been around the block"
But you haven't seen it all

I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what you're talking about
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what you're talking about

Confrontations every day
Argue, then we go our separate ways
It's always over as soon as it begins
Know that you're losing when you can't give in

I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what you're talking about
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what you're talking about

I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

You live alone and it's always the same
Talking to yourself when you say that I'm to blame
There's more to life than being right and wrong
There's something in between called getting along

I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what you're talking about
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what you're talking about
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what you're talking about
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what you're talking about

I don't know
