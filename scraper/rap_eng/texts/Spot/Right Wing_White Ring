Hey, mothers cryin' in the street
Because their children can't get enough to eat
Hey, daddy, tell me what you say
You send your kid to die and then you pray

Hey, people, see
It's what they want and it's what they need
Hey, people know
You send your kid to El Salvador
This ain't fucking television
This ain't high school

Hey, mother, tell me what you say
You send your kids off to war and then you fade away
Hey, daddy, tell me what you know
You send your kids off to war and they don't come home

Hey, people see
It's what you want and it's what you need
Hey, people know
It's what they say, it's no war no more
This ain't fucking television
This ain't college now, students
This is the real life

Hey, people, see
It's what they want and it's what they need
Hey, people know
You send your kid to El Salvador
Hey this ain't college no more
This is real life!
The real life!
