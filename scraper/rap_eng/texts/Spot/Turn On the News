If there's one thing that I can't explain
Is why the world has to have so much pain
With all the ways of communicating
We can't get in touch with who we're hating

So turn on, turn on, turn on the news

I hear it every day on the radio
Somebody shoots a guy he don't even know
Airplanes falling out of the sky
A baby is born and another one dies
Highways fill with refugees
Doctors finding out about disease
With all this uptight pushing and shoving
That keeps us away from who we're loving
It keeps us away from who we should be lovin'!

So turn on, turn on, turn on the news

You gotta turn it on, you gotta turn it on!
You gotta turn it on, you gotta turn it on!
You gotta turn it on, you gotta turn it on!
