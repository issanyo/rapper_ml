I was thinking
About the things I've heard today
And did they tell you
Most are rumors anyway
Conversation
It leads to feelings up or down
And I can lead you
By the way my wording sounds

Manipulation
Well it's always in the news
Manipulation
It always seems to cause the news
Manipulation
Well
Manipulation
It always seems to cause the news

The written word
Could drop a hundred atom bombs
And break up close friends
Break the strongest, closest bonds
Conversation
It leads to feelings up or down
And I can lead you
By the way my wording sounds

Manipulation
Well it's always in the news
Manipulation
It always seems to cause the news
Manipulation
Well it's always in the news
Manipulation
It always seems to cause the news

Manipulation
Well it's always in the news
Manipulation
It always seems to cause the news
Manipulation
Well it's always in the news
Manipulation
It always seems to cause the news
