You think you've made it to the top
Because people know your name
It's still the same
Your daydreams aren't forever
Better get your shit together for a new game
Back to your day job
Back to your girlfriend
Back to your hometown
The biggest lie

Passing harsher judgment
But you brought it on yourself by being you
Your trade your respect for no success
You tried to be a hero
But you end up nothing
