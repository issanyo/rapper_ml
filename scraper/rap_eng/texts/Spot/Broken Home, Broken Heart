I look at your house
I wonder what goes on inside
When you have to cry yourself to sleep tonight
Your parents fight
You don't know who's wrong or right
Have to cry yourself to sleep tonight

A broken home, broken heart
When the two of them will have to part

Broken home, broken heart
Now you know just how it feels
To have to cry yourself to sleep tonight
