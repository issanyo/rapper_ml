[Chorus]
Parents, why won't they shut up
Parents, they're so fucked up

[Verse 1]
They treat me like a tool
They take me for a fool

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They're so fucking dense
They look into the past
For future reference

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
They don't even know I'm a boy
Just treat me like a toy
But little do they know
That one day I'll explode

[Bridge]
I am a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I will destroy
I am a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I will destroy
Parents

[Verse 3]

[Bridge]
