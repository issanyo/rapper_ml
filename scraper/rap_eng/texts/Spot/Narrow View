(One, two, one, two, one, two, three, four)

I'm so tired of all this sittin' around
I'm so tired of all this bringin' me down
I'm so tired of all this rules of the game
I'm so tired of all this same old thing

Now I know, now I know, it's just a narrow view
Now I know, now I know, all's you can see is you
Now I know, now I know, it's just a narrow view
Now I know, now I know, nothing will ever change you

I'm so bored of all this young stupidity
I'm so bored of all this wreckin' the scene
I'm so bored of all this fighting with you
I'm so bored of all this try and take it through

Now I know, now I know, it's just a narrow view
Now I know, now I know, all's you can see is you
Now I know, now I know, it's just a narrow view
Now I know, now I know, nothing will ever change you

Now I know, now I know, it's just a narrow view
Now I know, now I know, all's you can see is you
Now I know, now I know, it's just a narrow view
Now I know, now I know, nothing will ever change you
