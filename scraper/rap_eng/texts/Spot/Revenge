Spoken:
It's not my imagination
I've got a gun on my back!

Promises you made
Never become fact

We're gonna get revenge
You won't know what hit you
We're tired of being screwed

Don't tell me about tomorrow
Don't tell me what I'll get
I can't think of progress when
Just around the corner
There's a bed of cold pavement
Waiting for me

Revenge!
I'll watch you bleed
Revenge!
That's all I'll need

I won't cry if you- die! die!
We're gonna get revenge
You won't know what hit you
We're tired of being screwed

Revenge!
Revenge!!!
