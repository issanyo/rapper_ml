[Verse 1]
Why can't you see you torture me
You're already thinking about someone else
When he comes home
You'll be in his arms and I’ll be gone

[Chorus 1]
But I know my day will come
I know someday I’ll be the only one

[Verse 2]
So now you wait for his spark
You know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel, the way you want to feel
When he starts to lie, when he makes you cry
You know I’ll be there

[Chorus 2]
My day will come
I know someday I’ll be the only one

[Verse 3]
Call me selfish
Call me what you like
I think it's right
To want someone for all your own
And not to share her love
But I’ll have my way
And won't have to say anyway
Cause I’ve got you
You don't stand a chance

[Verse 4]
So now you wait for his cock
You know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel
The way you want to feel
When he starts to lie
When he makes you cry
You know I’ll be there

[Chorus 2]
My day will come
I know someday I’ll be the only one x2

[Bridge]
So now you want perfection
I see your self destruction
You don't know what you want
It's gonna take you years to find out
I’m not giving up
And when you've had enough
You'll take your bruised little head
And you'll come running back to me
You know that I’m gonna be the only one
