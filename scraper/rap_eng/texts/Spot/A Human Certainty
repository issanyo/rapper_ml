Don't come in here
You'll see something ugly
It's not the kind of thing
You'd expect from a body
Don't come in here
Don't see me this way
With my knees on rice
And a prayer for the prey
My face is heavy
My mind is clenched
My eyes are disgusted
My hands are hot
My walls are green
My walls are red
I only cry wolf
When all my sheep are dead
Don't come in here
I beg of you
Yes there's love in my heart
But there's hatred in my thoughts
Don't believe in me
Or anything that speaks
For you won't be deceived
By a human certainty
My face is heavy
My mind is clenched
My eyes are disgusted
My hands are hot
My walls are green
My walls are red
I only cry wolf
When all my sheep are dead
Last night I had a dream about you
And in my dream you were only
Asleep I sat in a chair and watched
You as you laid there so beautifully
The still of the night made me lonely
I wanted to touch you. I wanted
To feel you. I wanted things to be
Just like they rise to be except I'd
Keep all my promises the I felt
So ashamed
I was so ashamed until
I realized we're all guilty of that dream
And forever I wish you
A beautiful sleep
