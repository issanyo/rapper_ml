He looked around
Saw nothing
Blinked his eyes and he was gone
He couldn't cry
With his head in his hands
He tried to laugh
But the tears still ran

Well he tried to warn you
But you didn't care
Then he just shook his head
Well he said no more
Just faced the wind
Glared and he was gone again

We had a chance
But we let it go
We let our dreams change our lives
And now every night
As you look to the sky
Hear his growl
'Cause we've gone much too far
