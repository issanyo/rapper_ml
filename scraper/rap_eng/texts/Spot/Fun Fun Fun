(It's a rip off, ha ha, one, two, three, four)

You don't understand what we're trying to say
You don't listen to us anyway
All of this it's just for fun
We're not out to hurt no one

Fun, fun, fun that's what we say
Fun, fun, fun that's what we play
Fun, fun, fun no matter what they think
Fun, fun, fun we'll have some anyway

I'm a punk and I like Sham
Cockney Rejects are the world's greatest band
But I like Joy Division and Public Image too
Even though that's not what I'm supposed to do
Yeah!

Fun, fun, fun that's what we say
Fun, fun, fun that's what we play
Fun, fun, fun no matter what they think
Fun, fun, fun we'll have some anyway

Fun, fun, fun that's what we say
Fun, fun, fun and that's what we play
Fun, fun, fun no matter what they think
Fun, fun, fun we'll have some anyway
