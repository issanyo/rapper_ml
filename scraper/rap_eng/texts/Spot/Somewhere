Searching for the truth but all I ever find is lies
Trying to find identity but I just find a disguise
Looking at the nightmare when I try to see the dream
Finding a reality as perfect as it seems

Somewhere the dirt is washed down with the rain
Somewhere there's happiness instead of pain
Somewhere satisfaction has no name
Somewhere I can be the same

Looking down on everything it seems a total bore
Missing all the people that I've never met before
Trying to find an unknown something I consider best
I don't know if I'll find it, but until then I'll be depressed

Somewhere the dirt is washed down with the rain
Somewhere there's happiness instead of pain
Somewhere satisfaction has no name
Somewhere I can be the same

Somewhere
