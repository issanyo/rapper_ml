[Verse]
I put my fist through the door
I hate myself for you
I love you
Suspicion rules my very soul
My knives are sharp, my thoughts are cold
I love you, I love you
Because I love you
I can't talk, I can't think
My feelings burn inside of me
I love you
I run through the door to the liquor store
The doors are closed, the tension grows
I love you, I love you
Because I love you
I practice my knife, I feel the power
I look in the mirror, and I-I wanna destroy her
I love you
I gave you my life, but what did I get
Now it's time to take it back
I love you, I love you
Because I love you
I hear a car, your footsteps outside
Knife in hand, love in heart
Sweating, I wait
I love you
You screamed, you bled, you laid on the floor
But now I know that you won't leave me no more
I love you, I love you
Because I love you
