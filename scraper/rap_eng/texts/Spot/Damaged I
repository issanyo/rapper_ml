My name's Henry
And you're here with me now
My life
It's a song daaahh
It's so you won't even let it happen
You won't
You won't let
DAMAGED
By attacks
I'm evil attacking my mind
But you don't mind
Cause this scheduled 13
You just sit, down
Buy the ticket
Wait your turn
Waaaaahhhhahahaha
Wooaharhhhhhhhhahh
Aaghhhhhhhh
Waaaaaghghhh
Aaghhhhhhhh
Can't feel another day
Can't get past you
I can't see nothin'
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
Hold out your hand to me
Give me your hand
..And I'll bite it off
DAMAGED!
DAMAGED!
DAMAGED!
Hrraagh!
I...
I don't even care about self-destruction anymore
What's the use?
I just sit at home alone
Cold fingers, gold fingers, in a cold sweat
And then I remember
I remember a day
We'd go for a ride in the country
And you'd say..
Sing it boy
Do it again
Do it again
Yes sir
Yes sir
Yes sir
Yes sir oh yes sir yes sir yes
Arghh
Right now look at me now
Look at me now
Just shadows
I'm just shadows of what I was
I just want another thing
I couldn't even get by for that
How much is that to ask for?
How- How much?
DAMAGED
Oh waawhhh
I, I'm sorry my friend, I guess I just can't
Lesson other thing nice
It's nice and cool around here
It's nice
It's my mind
It's my mind that's off guard
And no one comes in
Nobody comes in
Damaged
My damage
No one comes in
Stay out
