[Verse]
It feels good to say what I want
It feels good to knock things down
It feels good to see the disgust in their eyes
It feels good and I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls

I don't want to see the plan succeed
There won't be room for people like me
My life is their disease
It feels good and I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls

It feels good to say what I want
It feels good to knock things down
It feels good to see the disgust in their eyes
It feels good and I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls
It feels good and I'm gonna go wild
