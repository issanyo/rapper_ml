You talk and talk and talk so endlessly
You know you talk so much that you just don't see
All the news your telling me, I've heard before
I've got to get away, I just can't take anymore

Shut up, why don't you
Shut up, you never
Shut up, why don't you
Shut up

There's so many people talking in this world
Isn't it amazing no one's ever heard?
Still they go on babbling all through their days
Don't they realize that words just get in the way?

Shut up, why don't you
Shut up, you never
Shut up, why don't you
Shut up

Why do I keep listening to the same old mess?
I said, all this constant chatter's boring me to death
The nonsense that you're saying, it means nothing to me
Why don't you just shut up and just let me be?

Shut up, why don't you
Shut up, you never
Shut up, why don't you
Shut up

All the noise you make just ain't no fun
Don't you understand it don't interest no one?
All this fuckin' racket always going on
I said you better shut up, I'm gonna turn you off

Shut up, why don't you
Shut up, you never
Shut up, why don't you
Shut up

Shut up

Why don't you shut up?
Why don't you shut up?
You never shut up
Why don't you shut up?

Shut up (shut up)
