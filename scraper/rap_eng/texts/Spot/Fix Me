One, two, three, four!

Some day I'll feel no pain
Someday I won't have a brain
Theyll take away the part that hurts
And let the rest remain

Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please, I don't want to be dead

Someday we'll all be rich
Someday I won't listen to you bitch
I'll turn up the volume
And give 'em all the shit to play
Just for you

Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please, I don't want to be dead

Someday I'll feel no pain
Someday I won't have a brain
Theyll take away the part that hurts
And let the rest remain

Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please, I don't want to be dead

Fix it!
