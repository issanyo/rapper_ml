[Verse]
Thirsty and miserable
You drop to the floor
You drink 'til you can't even see anymore

[Hook]
Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more

[Verse]
My brother wants a ride to the liquor store
You pity him for what he wants it for

[Hook]

[Verse]
It's 1:30 and we're all getting nervous
The store closes at two
There's not enough to last us (Oh Shit!)

[Hook]

[Outro]
See if you can find the key to your motherâ€™s liquor cabinet
