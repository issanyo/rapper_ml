Don't run away (x3)
Why should I stay
And give my life away

You've picked my number
First thing I've ever won
But that's just my luck
Now you got me
Now I'm stuck
Stuck in a rut with
A knife in my gut

You've cut the odds
My chances have dwindled
Nobody wants me now
Gotta get out
Gotta get away
Escape to die
Some other day

Now I'm getting really confused
I wish I were you
Then I'd sit around and decide
Just who wins
And just who dies
