Baby, let's play God
You do everything I say
And if you're real nice to me
I might let you be the Pope someday

God, God, God
Baby, let's play God

What's this with this complex in you?
When you say jump we're all supposed to move
I've turned the tables now and I've got the gun
And God is pissed so you better run

God, God, God
Baby, let's play God

(God, God, God, God
God, God, God, God)

Baby, let's play God
And I'll be God so who are you?
It's not important what you want anyway
When you're God you get the final say

God, God, God
Baby, let's play God
God, God, God
Baby, let's play God
Baby, let's play God
Baby, let's play God
Baby, let's play God
Baby, let's play God

(My ears can breathe!)
