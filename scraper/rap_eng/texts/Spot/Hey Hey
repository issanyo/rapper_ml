[Verse 1]
Hey hey, what do you say
About our state of affairs
Hey hey, what do you know
Are you ready to go

[Chorus]
Go, go, go, go
If you think that everything's okay
Then go on home and lock your brain away

[Bridge]
Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready, ready

[Verse 2]
Hey hey, what do you say
About our state of affairs
Hey hey, what are we for
Are you ready for war

[Chorus]
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Now's the time to defend your worthless life
Are you going to kill, or be killed

[Bridge]
Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready, ready
To die
