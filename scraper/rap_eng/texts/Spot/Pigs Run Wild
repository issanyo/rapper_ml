They're the pigs with the guns
They watch us steal; they watch us run
'Cause they can kill us
And they'll be free in a couple of days

We're the niggers; kill us fast
We're dying to shoot some white man's ass
'Cause they can kill us
And they'll be free in a couple of days

You know, man, it's an old fuckin' story
But that don't make it right
Aw, fuck it, I'm used to it

War is near; that's no lie
But I'll be here when a red flag flies
Say revolution is in the air
The pigs are wild; they're runnin' scared

'Cause they can kill us
And we'll be back in a couple of days
'Cause they can kill us
And we'll be back in a couple of days

Man, it's an old, old fuckin' story
We're the niggers with the guns
We shoot the pig as he runs
'Cause they can kill us
And we'll be back in a couple of days
'Cause they can kill us
And we'll be back in a couple of days
'Cause they can kill us
And we'll be back in a couple of days
'Cause they can kill us
And we'll be back in a couple of days
