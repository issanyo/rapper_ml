Going out each day to score
She was no whore, but for me
Celebrating every day
The way she thought it should be

I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue

She was always by my side
And never tried to leave
Standing up for me
And like a tree for what she believed

(Chorus)

No more rope and too much dope
She's lying on the bed
Angels pacing, gently placing
Roses 'round her head

(Chorus)

I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
I don't know what to do
