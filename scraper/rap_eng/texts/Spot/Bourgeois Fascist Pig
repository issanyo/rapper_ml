You're the man that makes my life a drag
And you're the one who gives the world its snags
You're the one that gives me the will to live
And you're the one that gives me the will to kill
You bourgeois pig
You fuckin' pig

Everyday I see you on the job
And everyday I think you're a fuckin' slob
I'll get a gun, I got a knife
You mutherfucker, gonna take your life
You bourgeois pig
You fuckin' pig

I wanna see you on your knees begging
I wanna see your little kids beheaded
You get a gun, I got a knife
You motherfucker, I'm gonna take your life
You bourgeois pig
You fuckin' pig
You're gonna die, die
You're gonna die
You mutherfucker, no one will cry
Bourgeois pig
You fuckin' pig
You're gonna die
You're gonna die
You're gonna die
You're gonna die
