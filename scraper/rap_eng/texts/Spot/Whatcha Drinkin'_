I don't care what they say
I don't care what you're drinking today
I don't care what they say
I don't care what you're drinking today
I don't care what they say
I don't care, I'll be drinking today

Well, I try not to drink anymore
And I try not to think anymore
I try not to drink anymore
I try not to drink anymore

Well, I don't care what you say
I don't care what you're drinking today
I don't care what they say
I don't care what you're drinking today
What you're drinking today

I try not to drink anymore
Gonna try not to think anymore
I try not to drink anymore
I try not to think anymore

I don't care what you're drinking today
