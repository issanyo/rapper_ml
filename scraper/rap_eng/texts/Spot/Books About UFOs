[Verse 1]
Walking down a sunny street to the library
Checking out the latest books about outer space
Going to the fruit stand to buy a dozen oranges
Then she and the books and the oranges go back to her place

[Chorus]
She tells the same old story to everyone that she knows
She's just sitting in her room, reading books about UFOs

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I see her sitting on the rooftop
Perched in a lawnchair and staring into the sky
I know that somewhere in some faraway galaxy
That the gray men with telescopes are gazing right into her eyes

[Chorus]
She's telling the same old story to everyone that she knows
She's just sitting in her room, reading books about UFOs
One time! Whoo!

She tells the same old story to everyone that she knows
She's just sitting in her room, reading books about UFOs

[Verse 3]
Her life revolves around all of the planets
And she is constantly aware of all the changes that occur
I'm going to turn into a lens and focus all my attention
On finding a new planet and naming it right after her

[Chorus]
She's telling the same old story to everyone that she knows
She's just sitting in her room, reading books about UFOs
She's telling the same old story to everyone that she knows
She's just sitting in her room, reading books about UFOs
