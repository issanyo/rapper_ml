You know you're frightened
Because it's your time
A void, a blank
In your mind

Reserved for '99, you knew it would be there
Reserved for '99, you knew it would be there

"But", you explain
"I think I've found it
I feel the same
Well I feel much better"
If we could make my own grave
And whose future is it anyway?
