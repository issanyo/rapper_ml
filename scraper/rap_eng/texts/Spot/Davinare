March, Friday, or Saturday
Artshow night with Ron English
Says I'm a worthless bum

You know they call me a worthless bum
You know I've had my share of chums
But I'm a worthless bum says I

You might thinking of davinare
You might be thinking of things that scare
Whatever you're thinking, I don't care
To be stripped bare
Worthless bum says I

I never denied a precious gift
You know I probably stole all my riffs
But I'm a worthless bum Says I

Oh, can't you see?
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
Every move you make

You know if things get out of hand
You know I'm the one who understands
Without or with you I'm just doin, doin fine
You know I probably stole all my poetry
Even they took the most of it from me
But I will go on through the infinity
Believing the lie
Worthless bum says I

You know that I hear is pretty good
Understand I'm a worthless bum
Worthless bum says I

You know I never tried to rip you off
Never tried to take your life
Worthless bum says I

If you were me
And I was you
Then everything's all right
We're out of sight

Worthless bum
Worthless bum
Worthless bum says I
