[Intro]
I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified

[Verse 1]
I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified

[Chorus]
I want to be a clone
I want a suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home

[Verse 2]
I want to be masochistic
I want to be a statistic

[Chorus]
I want to be a clone
I want a suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home

[Bridge]
I don't want no hippie pad
I want a house just like mom and dad

[Verse 3]
I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified

[Chorus]
I want to be a clone
I want a suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home

[Outro]
I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified
