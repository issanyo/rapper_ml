[Verse]
Sun's comin' up and I can't decide
To spill my emotions or keep 'em inside
Go for a drive, go to the store
I'm lookin' for somethin' that can't be found there
I always wear a smile
Because anything but a smile
Would make me have to explain
And they wouldn't understand anyway

[Hook]
I conceal my feelings
So I won't have to explain
What I can't explain anyway
I can't decide
Can't decide
Can't decide anything
I can't decide
I can't decide
I can't decide anything

[Verse]
Every time I open my mouth
I always wish I had kept it shut
I gotta spill my guts, but I don't dare
I take a look around; I know that no one else cares
I always wear a smile
Because anything but a smile
Would make me have to explain
And they wouldn't understand anyway

[Hook x2]

[Verse]
Sun's comin' up, I still can't decide
To spill my emotions or keep 'em inside
Goin' for a drive, then I'm goin' to the store
I'm lookin' for somethin', but I still don't know what for
I always wear a smile
Because anything but a smile
Would make me have to explain
And they wouldn't understand anyway

[Hook]

No, no!
Maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow
