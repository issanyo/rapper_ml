I hate authority
Can't stand authority
Don't like authority
I hate authority
Yes I do

Don't tell me what to do
Don't tell me what to think
Don't tell me what to see
You've got no hooks in me
No you don't

There's no reason for you
To mess in my affairs
Get away from my face
You'll wish that you weren't here
Get away
Ha ha ha ha

I hate authority
Can't stand authority
Don't like authority
I hate authority
