Supposed to act my age
Supposed to act mature
I've got better things to do
Than listen to you
I listen and listen and listen
And listen and listen
I get fed up

I'm supposed to keep it together
Supposed to keep my cool
Yeah, I keep my cool
I'll show you how I keep my cool
I blow my cool, I blow my cool
I blow my cool all over the place
All over the place

I might be a big baby
But I'll scream in your ear
'Til I find out, until I find out
Just what it is I am doing here
Until then, until then
Until then, until then
