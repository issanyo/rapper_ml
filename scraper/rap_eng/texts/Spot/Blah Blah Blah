Got something to say?
Like something to me?
Just go ahead and spit it out
It's all the same, you see

What's that? It doesn't make sense
Are you talking in tongues?
Or is your brain out of gear?
I can hear it rattle in your head

I can see your lips move
Blah, blah, blah
But all I hear is
I can see your lips move
Blah, blah, blah
But all I hear is

Got something to say?
Like something to me?
Just go ahead and spit it out

It's coming out better
But it doesn't make sense
Is that a head on your shoulders?
Or something you use for ornamentation?

I can see your lips move
Blah, blah, blah
But all I hear is
I can see your lips move
Blah, blah, blah
But all I hear is

I can see your lips move
Blah, blah, blah
But all I hear is
I can see your lips move
Blah, blah, blah
But all I hear is
