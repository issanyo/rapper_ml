When I see you walking down the street
It's so hard to take, come on and give me a break
You're spending all your fucking time in school
Those lessons you learn are making you a fool

It's from the heart
You need to be shot
It's from the heart
You need to be, you need to be shot

When I see you walking down the street
It's so hard to take, come on and give me a break
You're spending all your fucking time in school
Those lessons you learn are making you a fool

So daddy's boy's got some brand new cash
You're messing with reds I'm gonna kick your ass
Come on, fucker, give me a break
You fucking pig, death is your fate

It's from the heart
You need to be shot
It's from the heart
You need to be, you need to be shot

Daddy's boy's got some brand new cash
You're messing with reds I'm gonna kick your ass
Come on, fucker, give me a break
You fucking pig, death is your fate

It's from the heart
You need to be shot
It's from the heart
You need to be, you need to be shot

It's from the heart
You need to be shot
It's from the heart
You need to be shot
