You can do what you want to do
You can say what you want to say
You can think what you think you want
It doesn't matter anyway

It's not funny anymore

Play what you want to play
Hear what you want to hear
Don't worry about the result
Or the effect it has on your career

Act like you want to act
Be what you want to be
Find out who you really are
And don't pay any attention to me
