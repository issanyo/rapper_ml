There is nothing left inside of me
Nothing, I do not feel
There is nothing left in here
Only a rage I can't conceal

There is no love
No love left inside of me
There is no love
And no place to hide
No love

I find myself going through the motions
But I don't care anymore
I try and I try to make it happen
But I'm not even sure what for

There is no love
No love left inside of me
There is no love
And no place to hide
No love

There's nothing left inside of me
It rained on my house for too long
And I don't care about anything
And still this shit goes on

There is nothing left inside of me
Nothing, I do not feel
There is nothing left in here
Only a rage I can't conceal

There is no love
No love left inside of me
There is no love
And no place to hide
No love
