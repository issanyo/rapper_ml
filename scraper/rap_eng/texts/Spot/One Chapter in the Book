Jam the window, cram the surface, read the answer
Trust and no trust, trust and no trust, trust and no trust!

We lend our knives to borrow trust
We bury 'em deep, we ball our fists
We kick the guilts with steel toes

Maximize your theory world
Use real parts, you'll learn the truth
You'll pay the toll, fall down the chute
