I never look back at it, but it's always in front of me
It's always worth the hurt, but I know it's hurting me
I'll never let go of it because it's all that's going for me
I'll put it in the past when the past is history

A perfect example is all the things it's done to me
I think I might lose my mind, but not my memory
A perfect example is the things it's done to me

I think I might lose my mind
I think I might lose your mind
I think I'll lose my mind

A perfect example is all the things it's done to me
I think I might lose my mind, but not my memory
A perfect example is what we all wish we could be
I think I'll lose my mind
Think I'll lose your mind
Think I could lose my mind
Lose my mind
But not my memory
(It's the only thing with a fair change.)
