He lives in his imagination with those friends of his very own
He doesn't get along with the outside world, he'd rather be alone
Sometimes when it's late at night he starts to wonder why
(The plans he made can never happen, so all he does is cry)

His parents, they can't understand why their son, he turned out wrong
He runs away from all the pain, and forgets them when he's gone
He'd rather be all by himself, because his plans they seem the best
He finally gets the nerve one day, and now life becomes a test

Mom and Dad, I'm sorry, Mom and Dad, don't worry
I'm not the son you wanted, but what could you expect?
I've made my world of happiness to combat your neglect
