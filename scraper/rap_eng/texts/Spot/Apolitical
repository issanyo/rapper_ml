If radiation hasn't changed
The glory boys from their goal range
And real facts just won't sway the few
You think that there's something you can do?

I'm A-political
I'm A-political

I don't care El Salvador
Can blow itself right off the world
And Reagan there with all his plans
Is just another yes-no man

I'm A-political
I'm A-political

It's hard for me to take a stand
When everyone has got the plans
To push the button on the bomb
Just a game and I'm the pawn

I'm A-political
I'm A-political

Leave me alone you pamphleteers
Give it up and buy me a beer
So many causes in the world today
They just get in the way

I'm A-political
I'm A-political

The end
