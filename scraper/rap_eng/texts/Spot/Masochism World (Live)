Can you feel it, feel it, feel it in your soul?
Can you tell me, tell me if it's hot or cold?

Can you tell me
What it is?
Does it hurt you
When I do this?

Stop it, stop it, stop it, you're pulling too hard
Stop it, you're going too far

Can you tell me
What it is?
Does it hurt you
When I do this?

Can you tell me
What it is?
Does it hurt you
When I do this?

I love it, I hate it, I love it, I hate it, too
I love it, I hate it, I love it, so how about you?

Can you tell me
'Cause I don't know
Why don't you tell me?
Why is it so confusing?
