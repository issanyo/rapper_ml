It's just like a battle zone
You got a bottle, now you're on your own
Gotta be a scotch or a kamikaze
None of those other weapons will faze me

First of the last calls
It's in your heart, it's in your mind
First of the last calls
Cashing it in before your time

Hundred hundred hundred bottles on the wall
You wonder if you can drink them all
Gotta go home at 1:00 AM
The bottle wins the battle again

First of the last calls
It's in your heart, it's in your mind
First of the last calls
Cashing it in before your time

First of the last calls
It's in your heart, it's in your mind
First of the last calls
Cashing it in before your time

This is our last
This is our last
This is our last call

This is our last
This is our last
This is our last call
