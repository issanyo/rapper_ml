Louie, Louie
We gotta go
I said now Louie, Louie
We gotta go

You know the pain that's in my heart
It just shows I'm not very smart
Who needs love when you've got a gun?
Who needs love to have any fun?

I said now Louie, Louie
We gotta go
Said now screwie Louie
We gotta go
Louie, Louie
We gotta go
I said now Louie, Louie
We gotta go
