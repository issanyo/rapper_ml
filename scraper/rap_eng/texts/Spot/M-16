[Verse 1]
Go shoot your M-16
Go shoot your M-16
Go shoot your M-16
I'm not gonna live your American dream

[Chorus]
Army life is right for me
Kill to save democracy
Got a rebel in my sights
Money's worth more than his life
So kill, it's fun

[Verse 2]
Shoot him, you're better than him
Shoot him in the eye
Shoot him, it gives you a thrill
Just like as a kid, only now it's for real

[Chorus]
