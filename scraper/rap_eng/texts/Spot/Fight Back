Sick to death, I'm sick of you
Sick of me, what's left to do?
Slit your wrist, what will that prove?
One point for them, and us we lose

Oppression
Deppresion
Oppression
Fight back!

Everything is going bad
Kind of seems like we've been had
I've had enough, well how 'bout you?
This depression, when is it through?

Oppression
Depression
Oppression
Fight back!

Are you ready to take a stand?
Make a fanzine, you make a band
You're telling me you got something to say
Quit your bitching, there's a way

Oppression
Depression
Oppression
Fight back!
