You got money
Well then you're living a good life
You've got a big fat daddy at home writing checks tonight
You've got nothing
Well then you're living a bad life
You got a big fine car and you eye me while you pass me by

Rich daddy
No I never had one
Rich daddy
No no I never had one

You got money
Well then you're living a good life
It seems like everything you touch wanna turn to gold
You got nothing
Well then you're living a bad life
And I guess I won't have nothing when I'm sick and old

Rich daddy
No no I never had one
Rich daddy
No no I never had one
No no no no no

You got money
Well then you're living a good life
You've got a big fat daddy at home writing checks tonight
You've got nothing
Well then you're living a sad life
You got a big fine car and you eye me while you pass me by

Rich daddy
No no I never had one
Rich daddy
No no I never had one
No I never had one
