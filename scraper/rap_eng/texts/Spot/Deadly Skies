Deadly skies
Deadly night dreams
Well it's no lie
To say what I've seen
I've seen the end
Of the grand scheme
'Cause we all die
By our worst means

I like to protest, but I'm not sure what it's for
I guess I've got no control over the threat of nuclear war
I made a sign to carry to show that I really care
I've heard it does some good if the television people are there

Dead trees, dead leaves, deadly skies
