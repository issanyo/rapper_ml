Saint Vitus was a young lad
No one knows how old
'till the kingdom took his life
For the things he told
The World is full of Wickedness
So Vitus says
"If you believe in God above you will all be saved"
Lust can breed corruption
So wash it from your life
Don't believe in the Government
Let your soul decide
And so the King grew angry
He say his end in sight
Young Vitus must be stopped
The little child must die

Saint Vitus- Hear his distant scream
Saint Vitus- Died for his belief

So if your breeding Wickedness
Keep this in mind
Vitus' soul is watching you through the veils of time
Well, people always stay the same
They never seem to learn
Till they all have lost their faith
And their souls have burned
