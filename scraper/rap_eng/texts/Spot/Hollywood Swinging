Said, hey hey hey
Whatcha got to say?
Said, hey hey hey
Whatcha got to say?
Hollywood, Hollywood swinging
Hollywood, Hollywood swinging

Say I remember
Not too long ago
I went into a theater, baby
I saw the Kool and the Gang show
I always wanted
To be in a band
To sing my songs
And be a bad piano playin' man
So here I am
In this Hollywood city, yeah
The city of the stars, women, music, and cars
I guess I guess I'll be a star

Say, hey hey hey
Whatcha got to say?
Said, hey hey hey
Whatcha got to say?
Hollywood, Hollywood swinging
Hollywood, Hollywood swinging

Hollywood swinging

Swing, swing, swing, baby
Swing, swing, swing
Hollywood, swing, swing, swing, yeah
