I'm making my case
Against a stack full of comics
Here comes the line...
"I'm loaded with rocket fuel!"

Industry, industry
We're tools for the industry
Your clothes in their laundry
Bleached of identity

You lie there naked
I lie here naked
Both on the pavement
Why are we different?

You lie there naked
I lie here naked
Both on the pavement
Why are we different?
