What can I do or say
To let you know the state I'm in
And just what will that prove?
How can you ever understand?
I'm sitting in the sun
Waiting for the rain to come
Looking into the dawn
And wishing that this day was done

I don't know which way to go
I just don't know which way to go
I just don't know which way to go
I just don't know

My all my everything
And now even that is gone
But still I try to sing
But the same old words still come
When will there be something
To take the place of all this?
Or is it me that's died
And the rest of the scene still exists?

I just don't know which way to go
I just don't know which way to go
I just don't know which way to go
I just don't know

I don't know which way to go
I just don't know which way to go
I just don't know which way to go
I just don't know (which way to go)
I just don't know (I just don't know which way to go)
I just don't know (I just don't know which way to go)
