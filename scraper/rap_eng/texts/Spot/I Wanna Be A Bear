[Verse]

Got your Jordache jeans
Got your pretty long hair
Dinner and a movie powder your nose
Take your money for a lay
Just like pay
You're just a human being on this planet
You're just flesh and blood like all the rest
You'll get old and have a wrinkled ass
Humans are cess I wanna be a bear
I wanna shit in the woods
In my cave hunt my prey
Could be you; I wanna have food
Burgers not berries
Ladies are women but women are not ladies
Got a baited hook you're calling it your cherry
You want to settle down
And you want to get married
I don't want to smell your muff
