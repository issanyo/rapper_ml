(What, are you crazy Wendell?)

Let's all yell so we'll be heard
You talk louder and I'll talk louder

Brick wall, brick wall
Brick wall, brick wall

I smash your head to get this in
You don't agree, fucking hit you harder

Brick wall, brick wall
Brick wall, brick wall

I'll stay here as long as you
Scream and yell 'til I turn blue

Brick wall, brick wall
Brick wall, brick wall

Testing you on my belief
Volume makes my point, not thought

Brick wall, brick wall
Brick wall, brick wall

Comfortable, I'm comfortable
Comfortable, I'm comfortable
Comfortable, I'm comfortable
I don't really give a fuck!

Let's all yell so we'll be heard
You talk louder and I'll talk louder

Brick wall, brick wall
Brick wall, brick wall
