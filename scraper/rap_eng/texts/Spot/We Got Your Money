(Ok, we're rolling)

Ok, get ready

(One, two, three, four)

I want to be a problem
I want to make a scene
I want to get reactions
And wake you from you dream
And I don't care if you don't like it
And I don't think that it's the best
As long as you remember
Then we're up with all the rest

I want to be different
I want to make you see
I want to make you wonder
Well is it you or is it me?
And I'm the big question
You'll never understand
And to all you frat boys
We got your money in our hands

I want to be different
I want to make you see
I want to make you wonder
Well is it you or is it me?
I'm the big question
You'll never understand
And to all you frat boys
We got your money in our hands
