All right

Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things don't seem the same
I'm acting funny but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple haze got it all around
Don't know if I'm going up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me

All right
Yeah yeah

Yeah purple haze all in my brain
Lately things don't seem the same
I'm acting funny but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
