I work and slave for my pay
Do things I hate for a living
I want my freedom before it's too late
Economic circumstances cause misgivings

I know you know what we all want
A life of leisure it's not too much
I know you know what we all want
What is your pleasure? What is your pleasure?
Work

40 hours, what do I live for?
A trailer and a weekend somewhere
Just to be happy and free from doubt
Situations that we can share

I know you know what we all want
A life of leisure, it's not too much
I know you know what we all want
What is your pleasure? What is your pleasure?
Work

I could get a job 9 to 5
In some office somewhere
And settle into a comfortable life
And rot my brain, but where's the fun of it?

I know you know what we all want
A life of leisure, it's not too much
I know you know what we all want
What is your pleasure? What is your pleasure?
