Yeah!

The time has come
To say what you mean
No more sitting around
Or hiding behind schemes
The time has come
And you've got to say
No matter what you do
We won't go away

We're not in it to lose
We're not in it to lose
We're not in it to lose
Fuck you

Use any excuse
To try to keep us down
We know that you're scared
Of what you see all around
We don't fit your dream
Your safe reality
But we'll do what we want
Because we got to be free

We're not in it to lose
We're not in it to lose
We're not in it to lose
Fuck you

We're not in it to lose
We're not in it to lose
We're not in it to lose
Fuck you

We're not in it to lose
We're not in it to lose
We're not in it to lose
Fuck you
