[Verse 1]
Almost ready, almost there
Or is it already over
A friend in need, she's a friend indeed
Needs someone to hold her
Alone at night, she plans her game
Correctly thinking that I'm in pain
Every night, it's all the same
She's been a-fuckin' with my brain

[Chorus]
She don't need no one
She don't need no one

[Verse 2]
We all wanna play your game with you
We know you're just a starter
There's no reason for you to quit
Just because we try harder

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna talk on the telephone
I don't wanna see no pictures
She'll find out just what she needs
When she does, I'll get her
She feels safe when she's with him
He'll never try anything with her
Now, you know, girl, you're just what I want
Are you gonna let it scare you
I knew it would

[Chorus]
She don't need no one
She don't need no one
She don't need no one
She don't need no one
She don't need me
