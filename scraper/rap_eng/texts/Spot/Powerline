What's this humming in my head
Was it something that someone said
It's connecting us with them
Electric wires turned on again

Well, it aggravates and it pacifies
Hear the power in the lines
Well, it aggravates and it pacifies
Hear the power in the lines
Well, it aggravates and it pacifies
Hear the power in the lines
Well, it aggravates and it pacifies
Hear the power

Strung high on every pole
How can this power be bought and sold?
Trying to harness solar rays
Making minutes seem like days

Well, it captivates and it hypnotize
See the power in the lines
Well, it captivates and it hypnotize
See the power in the lines
Well, it captivates and it hypnotize
See the power in the lines
Well, it captivates and it hypnotize
Aggravate, pacify, powerline

Powerline
Powerline
Powerline
Powerline!
