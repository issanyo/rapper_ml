I've got hands and I've got feet
I've got ears to hear the beat
I've got eyes and I can see
Everything I do is me

Money it exchanges hands
Money it can change a man
I won't bow to no man's hip
What you see is what you get

Fame is what you find inside
Fuck the others, you can't hide
From the fact that when it's through
All you've got yourself is you
