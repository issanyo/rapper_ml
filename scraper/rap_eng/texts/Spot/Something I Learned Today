Something I learned today
Black and white is always gray
Looking through the windowpane
I'm not inside, oh, your brain

Something I learned today
Yield to the right-of-way
Stopping at a four-way sign
Someone else's rules, oh, not mine

Something I learned today
Never look straight in the sun's rays
Letting all the sunshine in
Can't remember where, oh, I've been

Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
