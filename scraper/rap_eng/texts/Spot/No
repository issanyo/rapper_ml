My head's about to bust
If something doesn't happen I'm gonna blow
So many things I wanna do and say
And everyone keeps telling me
They keep saying no

No!
No
No!

It's not so easy anymore
When we were kids we could smile it off
But now it's all about responsibility
And anything goes wrong it's gonna set me off

No!
No

Different feelings come and go
Sometimes they make you want to lose control
Sometimes they take control of you
If I'm not responsible what am I supposed to do?

No!
No
No!
No
