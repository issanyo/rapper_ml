There's a girl who lives on Heaven Hill
I go up to her cabin still
She keeps a lantern lit for me
And a bottle up on her mantelpiece

She's the girl who lives on Heaven Hill
She's the girl who lives on Heaven Hill

She's got a big room and it's always a mess
Worn-out shoes and a worn-out dress
A worn-out smile that she'll wear some more
And a worn-out welcome mat by her door

(Chorus x2)

I'd trade big mountains and rooms full of gold
For just one look at the beauty of this woman's soul
Up on Heaven Hill is where I wanna be
That girl, that bottle, that mattress and me

(Chorus x2)
