[Verse]
Earth's a padded cell
Defanged and declawed
I'm living in hell
It's a paradise fraud
Straight jacket minds
In line to be old
Telling me to want
Well I'm not the fool
I'm going to town
Manic reactions are always a buzz
I'm suspect, the stranger in disguise
It's forced itself upon me
Something I can't hide

[Hook]
See it in... maniacs
Their eyes... maniacs maniacs maniacs

[Verse]
Looking at you, inside of you
Through your eyes, behind your mind
Looking at you, inside of you
I'm invisible, nowhere to hide
I'm obscene. the living dead
See the flys feed off your head
Looking at you, I'm inside of you
It's walden two, but the flower's dead

[Hook]
See it in... maniacs
Their eyes... maniacs maniacs maniacs

[Verse]
Earth's a padded cell
Defanged and declawed
I'm living in hell
It's a paradise fraud
Straight jacket minds
In line to be old
Telling me to want
Let time slip through my teeth
Well I'm not the fool
I'm going to town
Manic reactions are always a buzz
I'm suspect, the stranger in disguise
It's forced itself upon me
Something I can't hide

[Hook]
See it in... maniacs
Their eyes... maniacs maniacs maniacs
