If I told you that it wasn't easy
If I told you now, would you believe me?
I couldn't convince you if I tried
You weren't around all the times that I cried

Now if I told you that it wasn't easy
If I told you honey, would you believe me?
I couldn't convince you if I tried
You weren't around all the times that I cried
I was crying!

If I told you

I walked down that road a few times
And each time I walked, I got on my fuckin' knees...
But I know that I was... a thousand times!...
But I kept screamin'!

If I told you (If I told you)
If I told you (If I told you)
If I told you (If I told you)
If I told you (If I told you)
If I told you (If I told you)
If I told you (If I told you)
