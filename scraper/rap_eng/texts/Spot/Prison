Forgetting all the numbers
You're turning your back
Reject the possibility
That you could be off track

Conflict, value judgement
Conflict, barriers crumble

Refuse to fit in your mold
Makes us stronger still
Breaking ranks all the time now
Unclassifiable still
Everything in categories
Put the same with same
What about the one that's different?
He's not in the game

Have to have a category so you will understand, that's your problem

Using terms to fit yourself
You're building your own tomb
Close your eyes and give your judgment
You're giving us no room

Have to have a category so you will understand, that's your problem
Have to have a category so you will understand, that's your problem
Have to have a category so you will understand
