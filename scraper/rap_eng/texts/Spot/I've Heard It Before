Don't need authority
Authority figures
Don't need
Don't need their shit
Don't want it, can't stand it
Don't need their bogus attitudes
Got enough of my own
Don't need it
Authority
Bullshit
Authority
Bullshit
Won't hear their talk
I know what I'm doing
It may be wrong
But I gotta get it done
So, shut up!

I've heard it before
I don't want to hear it again
I've heard it before
I just want to shut you up

Fuck all you people who can't see my side
I've got my own strategies for my life
I've seen the emptiness in your ways
Don't tell me how to make my way

I've heard it before
I don't want to hear it again
I've heard it before
I just want to shut you up

Pressure rising pressure falling almost everyday
Going clear outta my mind Oh god another day
Don't forget you socks don't forget your shoes
Mamas little baby, fuck no

I've heard it before
I don't want to hear it again
I've heard it before
I just want to shut you up

Fuck all you people who can't see my side
I've got my own strategies for my life
I've seen the emptiness in your ways
Don't tell me how to make my way

I've heard it before
