I went to the shoe store
Looking to meet
Some young boy with a pair of nice feet
He's fourteen and I'm looking for work
Shoe store job
I need it! I need it!

Young boys' feet, I'm greedy!
Young boys' feet, I'm greedy!

Those shoes are hot
And I'm hot too
Lickin' those feet in the back room
Those feet really turn me on
Hey, Mom and Dad, there ain't nothing wrong!

Young boys' feet, I'm greedy!
Young boys' feet, I'm greedy!

Gimme your sister
I want her feet too
Gimme your kids
Just take off their shoes
Those feet really turn me on
Hey, motherfucker, there ain't nothing wrong!

Young boys' feet, I'm greedy!
Young boys' feet, I'm greedy!
Young boys' feet, I'm greedy!
Young boys' feet, I'm greedy!
