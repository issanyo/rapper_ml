[Verse 1]
Judgement time again, who's on the shit list this time around
Whose friends can we pick to tell them how to live

[Chorus]
Value judgement hide
It's a-comin' our way
He's just a jerk himself
Tryin' to hurt his own

[Verse 2]
He goes to the bar to get his girl
But the rich he's got ain't what it's worth
Says he need his little sexual push
Says two in the hand's worth one in the bush
Because he's just a pain in the ass
He's a thorn in my side why can't he leave me alone
Instead of running my life
