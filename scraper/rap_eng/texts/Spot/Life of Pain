[Verse]
Look what you've done to your arms
I know you don't care
Who do you harm
I know you've never been the girl next door
But now you're worse than before
Self destruct self destruct
Life's miseries pain runs deep
Does it matter what anybody cares
Can't there be another outlet?
Nobody gets close, nobody dares
Self destruct self destruct
I can understand your problems
And I can even figure out the reasons why
But I can't help the way I feel
And I can't accept what I see
And I just can't stand watching you
Self destruct self destruct

[Outro]
You're digging your own grave
And you're taking my feelings with you
There's got to be a way to get out
