There was no one all around
There was no one there but me
I was staring out a window
I was standing by the sea

The waves kept on repeating
Each one crashing to the shore
And my footprints nowhere leading
As they disappeared once more

Your senses, they are bombarded
By the roaring that you hear
In a shell, you can hear the ocean
When you put it up, up to your ear

There was no one all around
There was no one there but me
I was staring out a window
I was standing by the sea
