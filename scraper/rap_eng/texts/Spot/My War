[Verse]
My war, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
You don't wanna see me live
You don't want me to give
Cause you're one of them

[Hook]
My war, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
Them, them, them, them, them

Yeah!

[Screams]

[Verse]
War, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
I might not know what a friend is
All I know is what you're not
Cause you're one of them
Them

[Hook]
My war, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
Them, them, them, them, them

[Verse]
Yeah!
You're one of them
This time, this time
This lie
My life, my death
I have a prediction; it lives in my brain
It's with me everyday; it drives me insane
I feel it in my heart, that if I had a gun
I feel it in my heart, I'd wanna kill some
I feel it in my heart, the end will come
Come on

[Hook]
My war, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
Them, them, them, them, them

[Verse]
Tell me that I'm wrong
Try to sing me your ego song
You're one of them

[Hook]
My war, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
Them, them, them, them, them

[Screams]

[Verse]
You're one of them
You're one of them
I can't believe you
You're one of them
And you're one of them
And you're one of them
And you're one of them
One of them, them, them
Them, them, them, them, them

My war!
