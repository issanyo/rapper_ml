[Verse 1]
Running out of time again
Where did you go wrong this time
When your problems overwhelm you
Go get drunk, it's party time
Take a Quaalude, relax your mind
Relax your body too
Run from your problems but you'll never get away
No one loves you, and you wonder why

[Chorus]
Sitting there with your mouth full of beer
Your eyes are glazed, your face is red
Who's gonna pick you up and use you for tonight
When you're on the streets with a needle in your arm
Selling your body for another fix
Who's gonna pick you up and take you home with them tonight

[Verse 2]
You're running out of breath again
You're no old maid, you're only 15
You're losing your little girl's charm
Cry all night, you'll never get it back
Don't be afraid, it's not too late
Save yourself, I need you here
Wearing off, wearing out
I can't think about it cause it makes me sick

[Chorus]
Sitting there with your mouth full of beer
Your eyes are glazed, your face is red
Who's gonna pick you up and use you for tonight
Not me, not me
When you're on the streets with a needle in your arm
Selling your body for another fix
Who's gonna pick you up and take you home with them tonight
Not me, not me
