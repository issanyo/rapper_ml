[Chubb Rock]
For my, introduction in eighty-six I was lethal
Rockin for the grassroots and up keep the people
The movement of the bowel from that lay shit of the vowel
Mad share yeah, from Mr. Mufasa with the growl
The party's mad dead until I care to appear
Kids wanna know where the hell I been for the past year
No beer or no parka Nike gear no wear or tear
The new mic holder who causes, any fair
Some max and relax then mellow then strive
Shock-value MC's goin platinums with lies
The neophytic critics, who need big bats to hit it
They zone with the metronome clone to dome split it
When I joke around like Zog, rename them is like fog
I can flow digital, though my style is analog
I, base my career upon these years of how I've strived
Three years gone but I will survive, ha

Ha ha, ha ha
Now this "East vs. West," one contest was a taste
"Crooklyn Dodgers" and that libation, touched the fan base
A little, always scared in the place I scare any new rival
Past years missin dissin scripting up this new bible
I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican or some black nigga who's peakin
The lyrics are abundant, dirty fat blue beats are pungent
And now we gotta see how hot, will the son get
I'm a lyrical defamer, like Gloria I'm a Gaynor
In the music biz I opened up more doors than Kramer
My anthology's available, so buy up the archive
Three years gone but I will survive

For the duration..
Overzealous inhabitants flock with abundance
Paying tribute, to the one the circumfrence
Of the stadium, is paying homage, to my cranium
The sea of heads doesn't seem to hide the lady
In the back row, waving her hands for the ohh
The usual crowd rock line for a show
And I dispense with the usu-al, and keep it coastin
To boom up the set my advice is take a motion
Before you walk through the door, of a Chubb Rock tour
Buy the anthology in any store
Frontin, now we'll have ya, tougher than mutton
If I touch your button you'll start kick like Charles Dutton
Lyrics persevere and you really must strive
Three years gone but I will survive
I.. I.. I will will, survive, now ho!
