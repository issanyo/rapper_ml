[Tevin Campbell]
You know it G
First of all let's make it clear
I'm a strong young man
Takin' no shorts ya see, yeah
So if you plan on making waves
It's just a waste of time
You should face reality, yeah
(Check this out)

I don't want you to think that I'm afraid or shy (uh-uh)
Naive, I will never be
(You know it G)
I just want a friend so I can hold her hand
Come on, baby
And get with me, yeah

[Chorus]:
Just ask me to
I'll be with you
And hug
So much fun again
If you walk with me
I'll walk with you
And hug
You're my special friend

Forget, those people talking trash
(Forget about it, baby)
Just jet off and escape
Girl, it's not too late
(It ain't too late
It's not too late)

Baby, take Tevin by the hand
I'm sure you'll understand
Lady, this is fate
Don't be afraid
(T.C. one time now)

I'm not here to goof around
(So zero that thought, heh)
You should understand that, G
(Aww yeah, baby)
You can make all the type of waves that you want
But I won't let you play yourself
No not with me, yeah

Don't be afraid
We've got it made
We're young
It feels so good
To know we have room to grow

[Chubb Rock]
Check it out
Yo, check, check
Atomic Tevin
I know you really feel like you're in heaven
Your grill's a 7 and your bio reads 11 (14, G!)
If you really wanna see
Don't pretend to be all cute
She knows you got loot
Not Al B. can convince me that you're naive
The squabs will perceive your position
Rationalize who you are
Tevin Campbell, get souped
You're a star

She said, "Can you tell me where we're going to?"
To my crib for a few
Don't get sexual, sexual means "half"
If she's on that program
That's what your staff is for
She mighta been around the world and I I I I (what?)
You might find your baby, and if not
You can come to my crib
I'm Chubb Rock, peace
(Peace)

[Repeat Chorus]

Break it down..
Ay, yo, I'm in here, G!
Cause I'm the T to the E to the V to the I to the N, baby

Forget, those people talking trash
(Forget about it, baby)
Just jet off and escape
Girl, it's not too late
(It ain't too late
It's not too late)

Baby, take Tevin by the hand
(Take me by my hand)
I'm sure you'll understand
(You'll understand
You'll understand)
Lady, this is fate
(You got to understand, baby)

Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Awwww, yeahhhhhhhhhhh
Yeahhh, yeahhhhhhhhhhh, babe
Audi 5000
Peace!
