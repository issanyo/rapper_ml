Well real smooth connected to the deep end bass groove
I set the precedent for emcees to lose
More than a spelling B it's compelling me
To let the I come before the E except after C to the H
To the U to the double-B, we respect that name cause the rock just G'd
All over the commercial hard like Herschel
The verse will insult but don't take it personal
Everybody knows that I'm the man and
Always got a positive plan for the fans
First concerns as the world turns
To expose the racists like Howard Sterns
George Burns, oh my God, takes a black comedian and he learns
Make more greens than ferns
Horticulture is not my main subject
The subject is microphone check one two
And you don't stop the royalty fees
The Chubbster you know he's
"Gonna get the night on fire..."
Anyway you put it when you see me you know that I'm the man

Hypothetically speaking who's speaking at the function
Well it's some genius who lives by the Junction
He's coming from a Harvard socialite luncheon
Yo -- I hear his jeep clunking
A jeep -- doesn't he make enough ends?
A genius like him should drive a Benz
Well he believes clothes don't make the man or a car
And the man still makes five hundred grand
Every six months yo the kid is no dunce
And he doesn't drink and refuses to smoke blunts
Cause the black must clear the smoke and grab the throttle
And stop livin in a bottle
The Constitution starts tearin
I hope you hear what Gil Scott was Heron/hearin
The destruction of the pirates will calm the seas
The brilliant man you know he's
"Gonna set the night on fire..."
Any female structure?  Biologically I'm the man
