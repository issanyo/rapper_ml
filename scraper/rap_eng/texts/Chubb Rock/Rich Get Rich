[Lil' Dap]
Raptivism, yaknahmsayin?
Yo this live and direct, LIVE and direct
No More Prisons, yaknahmsayin?
Don't need no more baby
No more..

See we can walk through the streets, politic all night
Start to make our own tracks, for these cats to recite
Recite, rip through your jugular vein, right out your throat
Make these cats wanna provoke, I'm holdin it down with my folks
Cause we walk about it, with Helamic and Knowledge
Shinin bright like a diamond, sittin in BK rhymin
Holdin it down, waitin for the sun to set now
Look in the sky, see my man B.I.G. floatin around
One day we shine so bright, livin life so right
Lost my man tonight, settin it off, aight?
Check it like this, you got to go with the flow
Some people may not understand, but you know how it go
Because life ain't shit, you got to work for yours
Got to hustle from the bottom just to feed the poor
Niggas think shit is funny, got to work for yours
See the rich get, rich, the poor get poor
Jump up and grab the nina son you gotta get yours
Life ain't shit, got to work for yours

[Paw Duke]
The elements of life, got a nigga scared to death
I'm up to my neck, and I can't, hold my breath
Who woulda ever thought, at 22, goin through this
My young thugs bust guns, it's kinda foolish
My young ladies sell sex, it's kinda clueless
Let's get through this, illuminati's tryin to screw us
Blood for blood, ash for ash, life is bigger
The poorer man poor, while the rich gets richer

[Ed O.G.]
A lot of niggas think that pro-black, is so wack
Like the old school I'm a throwback, you know that
We plantin seeds that don't grow back, while the black
Still shinin like Kojak
You ain't never gave a shit, yo we OWNED that
Monopolize the whole game and control that
A lot of cats get scared so they hold back
Thinkin that they won't get paper sayin pro-black
But they think they get rich screamin blow gats
Bubble cracks on hot produced tracks and still dispute facts
I ain't tryin to hear another nigga schoolin me
Bout my paper my car or my jewelry
And who is he?  The one that tell you not to spend it foolishly
Cause this whole black movement, is movin me
Keep your head above water, or drown below
On the dee-low, not cool to have a P.O
You shootin craps, not cee-lo
Small time hustlers, who never reach the kilo
You know the steelo

[Chubb Rock]
From the committee of 300, niggas can't get blunted
The JFK niggas, UHH, died in cellblock niggas
From the crack lackeys, hold your asshole and cock backey
Warm green eggs in pens sweatin like pigs
Niggas get clockwork for five to ten blockwork
Then cry for balance, then toss the salads
Of the long wrong life, beaten knife, wound cabbage
Green veil niggas at night, for bail adage
Tim Allen bend, went to the pen, for twelve pounds of M
Home Improvement now rules the zen
Charles Dutton locked for eight moons for nuttin nuttin
Came back tougher than Martin Martin for fuckin
The Guiliani's, Armani's, who laundry
The ducats from the Mexicans sweatin niggz from Rahway
How the fuck can street crack rule the NASDAQ?
That's like a rap nigga getting a check from ASCAP --
-- can't happen, after Attica rule the Richter
The poor went raw and the rich got richer

[Lil' Dap]
Because life ain't shit, you got to work for yours
Got to hustle from the bottom just to feed the poor
Niggas think shit is funny, got to work for yours
See the rich get, rich, the poor get poor
Jump up and grab the nina son you gotta get yours
Life ain't shit, got to work for yours

[Chubb Rock]
Uhh! Uhh, uhh, nineteen ninety-nine
Huh huhh, with my rhyme
And low line, page ? means pace
Raptivism, means peace and peace PEACE *INHALES*
Bass Records, peace peace and p-peace
Rob Swinga, peace peace and always peace
D-Rock, peace peace and one time peace
Freeze Love, peace peace and peace peace
Cocksachie, Greenvale, Greenwald

And everybody in Riker's, one love
One love..
