Yeeeeah, haaaa
Chubb Rock
L.E.N.S
One Time

[Verse 1]

Ther is no other big hip speeker
I'm the final mix time tweeker
My fosil blowin your speeker (rooown)
Kids fed me like hienas
I been drum slap stands like when Ike did the Tina
And no gel either, no force to ????? a bomb
Misdomeanor and goes faster then a cheetah
The rap concepts cause fear, you don't have to go home
But you have to get the hell out the here
And yeah blunteds and rebums must pair
The dun gridy donna in drinch with gear
And the obvious sench hence with ??????
The news writer stating that the flow is over ah-ah
The best school leader, the destenied plan with a preacher
Greatness when I flow throug to ya urethra
The beat and the rhyme will peep to critique
When my cow jumps over your moon, don't sleep

[Hook]

Even if you sleep
You know that he'll be there
Just matters now it's on
We'll see who keeps them screaming
We know he'll kick the rhyme
That makes them jump or joy
Sweet dreams my son
You'll never away
Yeeeeah

[Verse 2]

From the minds of Minolta
From the press play boster
From the average Jack wack crackheads with Oprah
As from safe sex with rubbers
As for rapper turnin' mothers
As for exec's on the covers as for million march brothers
Shu-boo
The fair for my new scare-crow
You haven't been scared since I first heard the Wu
The beat well grinded, the rhyme ??????
In the future there's another new world criminal minded
And hallelujah kids hear this
The death kiss will exist your mix and his
The movement of the rational hip hop radical
The beef between foes was labeled practical
And ragional the ????? spell did sell
It made positive icons start to rebell
For the doe, not a flow when you check ??????
???? street soul to the lowest riddle
You creep don't sleep

[Hook]

Even if you sleep
You know that he'll be there
Just matters now it's on
We'll see who keeps them screaming
We know he'll kick the rhyme
That makes them jump or joy
Sweet dreams my son
You'll never away
Yeeeeah

[Verse 3]

Now here we go

Vocal booth I get on ???? with the truth
Loosin my tooth and get ready for the lyrical juice
Starts to pour hardcore rule ?????
G-Man Lp's gonna sell more then a whore
I'm certain and through the soundscan man I'm smirkin
Buyers are gonna run they don't like Levar Burton
I light shit up like uncle Fester
You wanna see me use your retina
I'm laughing at your skills like Fren Dresner
The beats like elastic the groove well crafted
I wanna be the best I told Nes to pick a classic
It's so erratic how easy it is to create static
The rude is demographic it's hard to be democratic
I've had it it's allmost time for the new word order
Watch your sons and daughters
Don't sleep

(Ooooooooooooh)

Don't sleep

[Hook]

Even if you sleep
You know that he'll be there
Just matters now it's on
We'll see who keeps them screaming
We know he'll kick the rhyme
That makes them jump or joy
Sweet dreams my son
You'll never away
Yeeeeah

Don't sleep

Even if you sleep
You know that he'll be there
Just matters now it's on
We'll see who keeps them screaming
We know he'll kick the rhyme
That makes them jump or joy
Sweet dreams my son
You'll never away
Yeeeeah

Don't sleep

Even if you sleep
You know that he'll be there
Just matters now it's on
We'll see who keeps them screaming
We know he'll kick the rhyme
That makes them jump or joy
Sweet dreams my son
You'll never away
Yeeeeah

Don't sleep
