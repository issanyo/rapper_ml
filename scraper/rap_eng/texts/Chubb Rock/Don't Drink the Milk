Intro: MC Nasal (Chubb Rock)

Word up it's the Nasal on the scene one mo' time!
With my man Kirk Gowdy on the mix
And my man Funky Owl in the mix
And my man Frank Nitti on the mix
While the Chubbster in the mix, I'ma kick it like, thissssss
Check it out

Verse One: MC Nasal (Chubb Rock)

Don't drink the milk cause it's spoiled form the racists
If you look up all the judicial cases
You see the niggas yo, dead in the woodwork
Cause of these KKK jerks
And I'm vexed, real vexed, let me tell y'all
While I kick it from the cellular
Well I'm the Nasal on the scene and fuck it
I hate cream in my coffee, so take your fuckin redneck off me
Concerning that Mississippi, stop that fuckin Burning
While I'm over here chillin, ready steady learning
Every racist summer, kill a large number
Of you son of bitch, who switch to Archie Bunker
Ignorant, accurate, coagulate, you imagine it
Hate the nigga boy, and stabbing it
All over, the odor makes you wish he was down with the Force
So you can mess around like Yoda
But no-no, and also, you knew so, the nigga grew so
Advances like Caruso... Robinson, Jackie, smooth and jazzy has he
Been respected, for the past three
Decades finds his baseball cards
Niggas have them then discard, and I'm vexed
Should I flex my pecks on the set?
And watch those Bill Cosby niggas just plex?
And his kids buy a white school kit, ana
And you know he talks, bullshit, ana
Throw your hands in the air
And look at that nappiness of your hair
And if you're proud of your peas, nigga say please
And niggas out there say YEAHHH!
*crickets chirping*
I guess there no niggas out there
Here comes the chorus for the year
Because, the Nasal... will eat shrimp and basil
Remaining head to toe on the foes
And he says he will
Flip on the brothers if they don't pump their fists and
Get busy, yell and scream like this

Chorus:

Don't drink the milk! (Why?) It's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (Why?) It's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (But why?) It's spoiled
(Hey daddy tell him why) The milk is spoiled!!

Verse Two: Kirk Gowdy

Every night (night), youth get tested (ested)
Mr. Establishment himself is well rested (ested)
Miss Sectretary, holds his message (message)
I would not make it selling drugs in Texas (Texas)
Which way would you look, or was you lookin? (lookin)
Every day, a nigga life is being tooken (tooken)
Vietnam, synonym Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
If ain't a nigga, it's a pussy I'm juckin (juckin)
Alex Haley, Rasta roots soil (soil)
The beginning, and it's over (over)
It wouldn't make sense if things wasn't so tense (tense)
Snatching purses, jumpin over fence (fence)
It seems so negative (egative)
They even got you robbin your own relatives (relatives)
Daily adventure, extravaganza (ganza)
No time to watch an episode of Casablanca
Bonanza, Highway to Heaven
Stray bullet, down goes a kid, who was eleven
Community sucks (sucks), no such unity
Kids die before they reach puberty stages (stages)
Look at the ages (ages), the parent wages (wages)
The reason was in school they never turned pages (pages)
You get vexed (vexed), and temperature boils
It must be the brat and not the milk that's spoiled (spoiled)

Chorus:

Don't drink the milk! (Why?) It's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (Why?) It's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (Will you tell me why...) It's spoiled
(Yo punk tell him why...) The milk is spoiled!!

Verse Three: Poke

Well I'm the Spanky of the crew and I'll Alfalfa you
And if you step to the Poke I kick nothing but jokes
One of the Masterz of the Trak, stick it groovy
Man I got more fuckin Juice than the movie
Lights cameras actions, I'm on a fuckin mission
Hissin, white boy fishin
Z-28, Camaro, Buick Regal
The will of these automobiles don't appeal to
The better half, and don't interview my staff
For four hundred years you stole, sold my craft
Now my ignorant dome is hard boiled
I won't drink the motherfucking mic, I mean the milk
It's spoiled!!
