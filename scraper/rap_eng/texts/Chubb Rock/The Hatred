Extremeties excite pulses and in turn different entities
Won't break bread or split the peas
But in the soup the mixture of several racial groups
Minority troops flavors the broth of Wall Street suits
Armani or maybe Versace
Monetary gain can't stop the White House frolics
Judicial alcoholics
Cover up versions of death in the Persian
Now a right angle equals eighty degrees
The Haitians brought the AIDS disease -- NEGATIVE
The scapegoat becomes a raging rhinoceros
Bush is steady watching us
How can we kill their Asiatic crew
Ahh develop a harsh addictive brew
Flood their beighborhood and let their leaders debate it
Part one of the hatred

The sequel the birth of many Uncle Tom's
I myself I can't stay calm
I shake in Bensonhurst rest in Bedford-Stuy
School in Sheepshead Bay, move to strong LI
But my self inner-self breaks North
And like Moses I'm judged by the cloth
Of my heritage who will bring forth the people
In all people there lies that certain evil
The enemy within spreads to the next of kin
A baby's no longer cute, here comes David Duke
Bring a halt and with a wound sprinkle salt
To the black -- lock them in a St. Ide's vault
Burp up the progress, the agony, the pain
Put down the brew have a brain
The freedom ice is thin and we're the first ones to shake
Then comes the real hate

Why should you hate me?  What have I done?
We all have eight fingers and two thumbs
To feel the oppression so every studio session
I try to kick a positive lesson
U.S. coverups are neat like Tony Randall
Brotherly love is melting like a candle
Humanity without human beings
They even said Chubb was against Koreans
I just wanted to state the facts
It seems that no one is against Blacks
Uhh, what should we do?  Should we run?
Uhh, if we run we'll succumb
They're mad so don't you know they're scared of the dark so
And the dark so rule the bank so
So you know that they're mad so
This style developed by Shabba Ranks so
And with that I wanna give thanks so
To the temperment of the strength of Miss Parks
But even now in the nineties we will spark and respark
The hatred
