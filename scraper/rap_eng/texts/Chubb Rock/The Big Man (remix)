[Verse One]
The bigger of the biggest made a hitlist
Not a lot of people, but a sequel, so witness
The evolution of a seed planted four years ago
And now the offspring today is the new thing
The people wanna jock but if they won't here's a quote:
Jealousy has arisen but don't - sweat it
And in this particular case - don't let it
Hold you back from pledging allegiance to this
And your girl wants a kiss but I have my own miss
On my side til the skeezer in me died
Like the (?) to the John, the Crosby to the Bing
The Dave is to the Benny and the Big Man is ready
To take a stand for all big man-kind
And I'm gonna succeed with the rhyme
So potent that a consultant said that rappin rodents
Have two-thirds of my intelligence quotient and knowin
Just that, secures me from all the muskrats
And my degree tells me I don't must rap
But the fans of hundreds of grands know I slam
Love the jams of the Big Man - chorus!
