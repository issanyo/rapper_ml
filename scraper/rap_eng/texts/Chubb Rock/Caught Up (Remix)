[Verse 1: Chubb Rock]
Transforming, flowing, yo go on
I'm not hot but I'm yearning while I'm burning warm
I'm like a wizard, I make a blizzard and a storm
Have knowledge from a college with a dorm
And I'm greater than Swarschenegger, I'm strong
Ya be hurt when I sing a LeVert song
I'm storming like Norman but my name ain't Norm
Rhyming is a climb so I'll drop the dime and
Go on and on to the tip, tip top
Give a tumor, end some rumor 'cause I am Chubb Rock
When you chuckle, hits you with a belt buckle
And beat you, eat you with a pig knuckle
Don't vex it, yo, you better hit the exit
You need a value pack, you little anorexic
You'll be yawning in the morning at the crack dawn
To the groove, it's your move, little pawn
Wanna riff it, 'cause eff it, it's specific
I'll just say checkmate then move the bishop
To queen level four, know what's in store
Sing to the king then take the board
To the crib before she can think again
How I knocked her boots from here to Michigan
I'm caught up

[Chorus: Sam Jaffe and Flavor Flav]

Man

[Verse 2: Chubb Rock]
Chubb Rock is hard, but yet I'm sweet like saccharine
Got the lyrics to take your Cathryn
To the crib, knock the boots to Japan
Like the little train, I know I can, I know I can
When the boots come back, I knock 'em to Wisconsin
I'm hard like Bronson but you know my Johnson
Is stiff and hard like a diving board
With good suspension like a Honda Accord
I'm like Dennis the Menace when I got Venice
Get a lot of love but not from tennis
I got a lot of fans in France
I got an aunt named Ferrari and an uncle Benz
Convertible rice and I'm nice
And I'll achieve like Dr. King 'cause I believe I'm caught up

[Chorus: Sam Jaffe and James Brown]

(Can't stand it)
Woman

[Verse 3: Chubb Rock]
Twice a month I have to change my number
'Cause these girls want a little lumber
Always having beef with Nynex
Girls clock me like Timex
Send me nasty letters and postage cards
Anything to get the boy a little hard
Is it cause I'm a star?
It gives effect, but then
Michael Jackson don't get sex so it can't be that
I'm just unique
Large, smooth like the DeBarge physique
And if you wanna lift up your shirt and your skirt
You will hit a high note like LeVert
I'm a casanova, believe me
And you wearing that itsy bitsy teeny weeny yellow polka dot bikini
You know why, don't lie
I'm caught up
