My better half steps, the door closes
Hence the realistic War of Roses
With history every war had an ending
With casualtoes, but half of these
Men, the battle was an ego thing
After I kick this rhyme Eric will sing
The true statement that lies here
Every day every month that's in a year
Has to be spent making this work
Sometimes I know that I act like a jerk
I have no experiences, I never felt this way
You misconstrue what I display
Love, honestry and trust is a must
Communication wrapped in lust
But being that I can't sing but the words are by me
I got a little help -- Eric sing it G

Passion easily mistaken for compassion
I know why you wanted to jet
No respect
I guess in that department I had a low rating
I remember in front of Crossland Savings
We said the magic words, I looked in your eyes
Blood percolates, hearts yells cries
For us to come together for better and for worse
I don't even know how to end this verse
Utopia, you're wishing and I'm hoping
We can keep on dancing to Michael Bolton
When a man loves a woman just like I do
Our joining will make little love struck crew
Love, honesty, trust is a must
Communication wrapped in lust
But being that I can't sing and the words are by me
I got a little help, Eric sing it G
