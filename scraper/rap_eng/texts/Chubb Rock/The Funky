Nuff respect's due to the funky crew ribbit
Bitch burned me with some next shit
I realize ya straight up fucking someone new
And all those rumors are so true
That you been fucking the whole damn crew
Ya little ribbit
I am the all around totally extraterrestrial entertaining motherfucker
Let me tell you bitch you burned me with the motherfucker
I was walking through the park one day
In the merry merry month of May
And I buck up to this squaw that gave me the funky
And let me tell you 'bout this pussy, ha ha
She burned me hard and stiff
Yes me hard and stiff Chubbs, tell them Chubbs tell them
Ribbit ribbit

Well off we go to the show and flow to the venue
This little hot bitch was on the menu
Dance to the tune they said the ho was a boom
But I'm married, my ass got carried to the room
But delph, in layman's language for self
And I'm in love -- in love with my health
So honey phone while I click the Nick Nolte
And down a can of beer and watch Cape Fear yeah
Watch DeNiro my hero fry like a clown
It's all for one I hope you have some
Slown down as the puss from the hot itchy burning little stunt
I bet on is what you really want
Cause by the cheek smile, eyes that are hazel
You know who's really vex -- my man nasal
The nigga who ate the sauteed shrimp and basil
Bitch stay still I'm not over with you yet
My man got burnt now it's time to fret
Airport bathroom I wasn't too far to hear my man go
Oohhh
Burning -- yes he's yearning call his folks
911 is a Joke -- I can't see through the smoke
Lyrical monkey son he's stunnin G
Cause you got the funky
