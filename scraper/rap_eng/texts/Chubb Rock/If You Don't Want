Chubb Rock: relationships man
O’hene Savant: man if you wanna call it that, I don’t know what it is
Chubb: I ain’t know you was goin’ through that man
O’hene: you’d be surprised brotha
Chubb: I guess we all go through it
O’hene: on that one you ain’t never lied
Chubb: let me hear your story
O’hene: I had to tell her like this

Verse 1:
You don’t want it no more, you say you tired huh?
I ain’t workin’ for you, now, I’m fired huh?
All the arguin’ and nitpickin’ gets sick’nin’
And over little stuff, it’s just ridic’lous
You used to like it when I used to bite it then
But now you say it gets on your nerves
So I’m convinced, it ain’t my touch girl
It’s just not what it was
We used to love now we fuss and we cuss because (wooo)
Just because not for nothing much
‘scuse me Chubb but my situation f*ckin’ sucks (wow)
What started on the up-and-up up and jumped
Off a bridge so it’s on to another one, one

O’hene: I had to tell her man I’m O’hene Savant, you know what I’m sayin’? Sometimes I had to remind ‘em, it’s crazy but that’s how it be sometimes
Chubb: you got more?
O’hene: oh, brother, trust me
Chubb: there’s more to it?
O’hene: you ain’t even heard the worst of it, check it out
Chubb: aight

Verse 2:
Tell ‘em Bobby ‘cause I be kinda feelin’ cocky
You ain’t returnin’ calls thinkin’ it’a get inside me
It may a little prob’ly, this ain’t one of my hobbies
Sittin’ around waitin’ and pacin’ up in this lobby
It’s obvious that us must need reviving
‘cause I be upset vexed with all the lying
Truly I don’t own you but I’m cool see
Do you, I’ll do me or include me
I know the facts, a master when I throw the back
Not to mention I’m patient like a older cat
I know the tension is crazy when I’m holding back
I go to lengths that’s amazing when you show ya a**

O’hene: you feel me Chubb? I mean that’s exactly how I played out, I mean it was crazy
Chubb: I don’t know if you wanna hear my story
O’hene: ah it can’t be no worse than mine, man, I can’t even imagine
Chubb: it’s a rite of passage though man
O’hene: well, if that’s what you say brotha
Chubb: sometimes you pick the wrong one, sometimes the right
O’hene: you ain’t lyin’ about that either, ha ha ha

Verse 3 (Chubb Rock):
Feel me
Sometimes, play up, people take kindness for weakness
Upset, they even reject respect, peep this
Met baby girl at a club, wrong place
A thousand people dancin’ only saw one face
The usual beginning - hello, the number, the bed swingin’
Something was off man my spider sense is ringin’
She moved like a crook move, I didn’t approve
Not really crime just lies mixed with past [?]
I’m already heart-invested so I kept on
That lonely Posturepedic that she slept on
Even evil has an expiration date so I waited and waited
Bad movie, nothing was slated
When you give her the truth player, she gives you back lies
Ya give her fifties man, she gives ya back fives
She didn’t want or deserve it so I left with it
I’m sure there’s another taker out there that wanna mess with it
I’m out

O’hene: and I can’t blame you either man, after you tellin’ me that
Chubb: when I’m done
O’hene: yup
Chubb: I’m done
O’hene: well
Chubb: I’m out
O’hene: I feel a little bit bad sayin’ this man but after hearing your story, I gotta admit I feel a little bit better yo, that was really crazy bro, man if you hadn’t said it so brilliantly I probably wouldn’t even believe this was true, I guess that’s relationships for you, y’all out there, look out
