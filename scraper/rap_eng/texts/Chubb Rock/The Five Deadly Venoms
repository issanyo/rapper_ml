[Verse One - Hotdog]
Aiyyo ??, I got the batter, get the mixer
As the trickster will fix ya a batch of rhymes
You know that soothes, like an elixir
And sticks your ribs so let the cheese and wine
Or rather wine and cheese
Cause I aim to please with ease hope the crowd sees
That I'm, the man that loves to flam
And when I step into a jam I just slam like Jordan
And this is the world, accordin to me
The capital-H-the-O-the-T, the-D-the-O-the-G
Rockin, heavenly hype and ?? steadily
When I come in to rock'n'roll, I'm sure you will agree
That I got a hype type of style a family
But Diggy Doc gave it to Rob to rock and Howie Tee
Now, I'm talkin about Omega Psi Phi fraternity
Givin a little history
For some people, their lucky number's 7
For Q-Dogs, it's 1911
November 17th, underneath the ceilings
Behind the walls of Thirkield Hall

[Verse Two - ?]
This is a family affair, rather a gathering of the brothers
United we stand, we're not divided like the others
And when I mention the word divided, you know what I'm meaning
Show a brother something they don't have they start fiending
First the ear-grabbin, then the back-stabbin
This from brothers that I call friends, I'm not havin
The other negative things in a friendship
An occasional whipser, gossip, a loose lip
I once trusted a brother with an eyeful
He told the next man, cause he's livin trifle
But now I'm not worried cause I'm part of a family
United til death simply cause we choose to be
An occasional joke, a diss, or a crowd pleaser
Callin your moms a ?? look-a-like skeezer
Whoever wins the diss battle, respect is given
Fightin over words is not how we are livin
Then there's ?? word I almost forgot
Three-on-one, no heat, but the rumor's still hot
The bro's get a ho that you know is totally widdit
There's no need to be discrete cause you know she won't admit it
When I think back on the memories
Just like these - is it a wonder that I love the 80's

[Verse Three - Rob Swinga]
Well I'm Rob, a.k.a. as the Swinga
Comedic at times, and a stone-cold thriller
I got somethin to say I'll make it short and sweet
Me I'm the Swinga I'ma swing it to this beat
Now I talk to a lot of people with the large vocabulary
Colloquial language I'll use that's secondary
And then there is slang and I would use that third
And I'll say outrageous things that might sound absurd
But - right back into my large vocabulary
I'm the type of guy that'll always be primary
Never secondary, to any adversary
If they want to be like me, on the contrary
They try to compete, but I will always delete
I'll leave them cryin from the agony, of defeat
And when they try to return to repeat
I make them hold on peace signs, say "Swinga I retreat"

[Verse Four - Chubb Rock]
Well the Toad is immensely strong on the instrumental
The lyric can hit and shock the pure metal
Chubb Rock has a weak spot, creatin
An iron maiden cannot pierce my skin when I hit top 10
Run for shelter, cause you're gonna fear this tune
More than you feared the age of Helter Skelter
Watch how we behave, Diggity Dog and Dave
The Roadrunner and Swinga always sayin that smegma
Is the product of ten intense games of balls under balls
I have Professor Paul's
Kicking ability, the Snake's agility
The ricochet speed of the Centipede
And the devilish mind of the Scorpion
The Lizard is unrealistic and simplistic
And loitering is prohibit, the tune is illiterate
Diggy Doc no, Ed Lover forever my brothers in crime
They watch my back at the drop of a dime.. when we climb
And work and work hard and struggle to stay alive
And strive, the Venoms, the Five - check this out..
The Roadrunner

[Outro]
Yo Chubbs can we make a little gravy and shit
Can we get ours, whassup man?
Niggas is takin caravans all the way to North Carolina n shit
Whassup wit dat shit?  Niggas don't respect my situation
Yo can we make a little gravy chief, whassup?
