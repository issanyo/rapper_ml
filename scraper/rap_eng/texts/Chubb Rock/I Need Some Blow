Just like on A.T.E.E.M, I'm an addict, I'm an adict
Back at the crib I just cause nothing but static
I think my mama-san is pissed and vexed cause she's had it
Snooped and found my stash in the attic
Not tickled pink she threw my my shit in the sink
My gut is rumbling now I have to think
My sister's jewelry, take it, no more jingling
On the crazy down low take my mom's wedding ring
And float on to the shop called the pawn
And he gives me two yards and my disregard to nothing
The antonym of a hero
I used to be the one now I'm less than zero
But I can feel like a million real fast
Put my lips on the god damn glass
And make a little snow using the snowman
I can't help it I need some blow man

I used to get A's across the board now it's down to H's
And the H's stand for hatred
Kicked a lot of bogusness, conned out of rehab
It was easy -- my man worked at the lab
So I jetted like the Concord but I made a crash landing
Got back on the glass cause life is demanding
First thing to do now is to get a little pistol
I like to smoke blow but I don't like eating gristle
So the hoody comes on while I'm hiding in the corner
Just run ya doe or your mom will be a mourner
The blow make me actlike I don't know
And my ego and my moral go into escrow
The kid that I robbed the other day was my bro
Face covered by the hoody yo should he
Care about his worthless bro -- the answer no
I can't help it I gotta get some blow

My mom was sponsoring a child from Zimbabwe
Whem I'm on the pipe man I have to get my way
Donating about twenty dollars a week
80 dollars a month for that I get a blunt
Everyday I puff several trees
What do I care if he eats every other day
What am I saying, I can't believe I'm a junkie
I can't believe it yo Frank Nitty punch me
Suicide is too good, I need something harder
Maybe go cold turkey, that'll hurt me
Sweat drips on my back I react with a shiver
Eye flutters while my mom closes her shutters
She doesn't believe that I'm trying -- my body dying
She thinks I found a new way of lying
While I revolve the revolver, my mom hears the tune
I'm sorry mom *BOOM*
