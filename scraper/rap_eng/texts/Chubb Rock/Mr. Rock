Ha-haa, a bass intro
That's right

[Hook: Al B. Sure]
Back-back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel
Feel it today

[Verse 1: Chubb Rock]
For those who don't know the name
Or can't distingush the rame
It's the legendary Chubbsta who was arround when Jane
Was arround Eric and P
For something on that LIE homie
The bass of A Tribe Called Quest with
Hip-hop at that time was mentaly older
Had lyrical soldiers, KRS was the holder of the bolders
The mortals of Latin Quarter had no time for nickle and dimes
We need to go on +Great Adventures+ with Ricky D rhymes
I'm the biggest fan of this rougish gonra
Exec's will con ya while the regiments will be on you to harm ya
If you disrespect the microphone on check
Put 'em in a yoke and snap his neck and rip a 60 minute set
I will arive before the sampagne wishes
The caviar dishes
Chicken of....witch is P.E.'s +Gratest Misses+
When you meat and the movement I win
Getting stoped, it kills me but it was the birth of Mr. Rock-Rock

[Hook: Al B. Sure]
Back-back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel
Feel it today
Back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel
Feel it today

[Verse 2: Chubb Rock]
......in the hearse of themes
For a positive verse at this point I settle for one lace with a curse
All eyes are blue to the one that acts rod
Brilliant deep rooted talents somehow gets mold
Can I tackle this beast to ass
To calm the savage beast is a simple tentask
I am the best thing since sliced wheat bread
The anger in my-am turns graffit to led
We're on
Script nothing but black thought
Educated ghetto street want to meet me
Pure knowledge the sense flows through the smirkings
Touch my hand you start to shape like
I am what I am and what I am is the man
Never take it in vain but my man....but damn
I'm the lyrical all that hits the BS
Can't stop it bores me
And they call me Mr. Rock-Rock-Rock ya don't stop

[Hook: Al B. Sure]
Back-back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel
Feel it today
Back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel
Feel it today

[Verse 3: Chubb Rock]
This is the 5th LP and this big kid is still alive
He is the shit like Windows 95 sharp like a zip drive
I've brought my tounge and its high sprung ego
Everywhere he go, we go, you know
I am still in tune with the rhythm
Clinton in the prez' but I voted for Sherly Chizm
The memory is erratic it snaps like elastic
Rap needs no doctor though some of the members are pedeatrican
That is fantastic it leaves room for adults
Crate diggers, beat freaks or lyrical goats
And I'm all three, it's me three time fold
The some of the parts must equal the whole
And some are measuring their words with nothing but gold
And platinum trinkets for those who sold
Is it the true art form or you can form for the not
I'm the artist of the year
And they call me Mr. Rock-Rock-Rock you don't stop

[Hook: Al B. Sure]
Back-back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel

Back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel
Feel it today
Keepin it real
Keepin it real
Keepin it realBack-back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel
Feel it today
Back in the day
Keepin it real, so you can feel
