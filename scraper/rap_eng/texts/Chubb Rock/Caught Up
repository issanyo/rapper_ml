[Verse 1]
Well I'm nimble
And I'm nice like Kris Kringle
But Joe I got caught, caught, got swindled
Me and a couple of boys at Kings Plaza
Walkin' through the mall to see if they had a
Couple of shirts, a few pants
Just out of the blue, went, took a glance
In front of Macy's I seen two girly-girlies
One looked def, the other looked like Mr. Furley
With my ego trip, my Wilson flip
I used my lip to get both on the sneak tip
Then I sicced it
Kicked it to the ugly one
Souped her up, I called her Lipton and honey one
Things like that, gibberish and crap
She's a skeezer, there's no need for chit or chat
Her body looks [?], kinda good, yeah, but
As for her face, Jabba The Hut
I shoulda played Michael Jackson, told her to beat it
I said, what the heck, I got a condom, freak it
Her nickname now is Mona the rover
She looks like a dog so I dogged it on the sofa
Some dumb reason though, it was fun
Now she's looking good to me, I'm caught up part one

[Verse 2]
I'm in love with an ugly girl, but hey
I'm gonna kick it to the pretty one today
She seems nice and she's a fly cutie
Called her up I said, "Hi my name is Chubbs," her name was Judy
I don't have to tell you guys the rest
But I asked her to go out, she said yes
Took her to the movies and then to my house
Led the girl straight to the couch
Like a game, I have to score
Dim the lights, get the two-ply condom from the drawer
Took off her shirt and only then I asked the question
Yo? who broke wind? something smells bad, dang
It won't let up!
It was Judy, the cutie! yo, word up!
So now I got an ugly girl and one with the smell
But which one should I choose? oh well
I'm caught up

[Verse 3]
I know I'm hard, 'cause I'm Chubb Rock
But even to my chest I got a soft spot
That could easily be ripped apart
I'm hard like the Tin Man but I got a heart
Every night it seems I stay home sick
Trying to figure out which girl will I pick
Ripping my heart, damaging my soul
All these problems because of a little hole
And recreation in a bed
But Mona and Judy are getting me fed
Up to the point I couldn't even hold my own
I was like E.T., I had to phone home
To ask my mom a question she always knows
She says Chubby, follow your heart and your nose
Be celibate, no girl, be a loner
But I picked the ugly girl yeah, I picked Mona
