[Hook: Q-Tip]
We got somethin
For all of y'all
We like to play
We like to ball
This is a story
For all of you
When we do our thing
We got to do it true

[Verse: Q-Tip]
Sittin in my canvas in the corner of my room
12:45 as the radio booms
Paging you six times
Call you on your cell but it's just a bad line
It's a full moon so I'm bout to howl
Thinkin for a slight, "Is my girl on the prowl?"
Naw, I guess she wouldn't violate us
Plus hittin' gets for real and she doesn't like to fuss
Callin up the shorty that I met four weeks
On the street, lookin sweet, and I was about to eat
Conscious of my lady but we was on the outs
Had mad love but I had mad doubts
On the phone talkin, gettin on my swerve
But thinkin bout my lady, guess I had some nerve
We was still dreamin and I had a little shot
Cause I didn't even hear it when the door unlocked
"Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?"
Now she standin over me, I said "I gotta go"
Turned around quick but I hung it up slow
"What's the deal, love, what's goin on?
I see it in ya face, just tell me what's wrong"
"Mm, nothin, I think we need to speak"
"Mm, okay, well, just have a seat"
She wears a frown, she lookin 'round
Sweat comin down and she doesn't make a sound
Tappin on the table growin impatient
I'm gettin up and now I start pacing
She says "Alright!" as she starts to conversate
"I'ma do what you do" then I say "Elaborate"
"Well you got that girl on the side
What if I had a guy then, too?
Would your heart be broken, boy?
I'd wonder what you do"
"Are you tellin me you got a dude
Who's lovin you better than me?"
"No, but I caught ya ass
So I guess I'm settin you free"
"Yeah, whatever" as a standin pride
"Me and her is only friends though, we never end, yo
We're gonna still tie intimate ends, yo
I think so, my shit is on lock, ho"
"Word? That's how it's goin?
Well I guess it was really good knowin"
"I'ma still just keep in contact"
"Oh, no, there's no need for that"

[Hook]
We got somethin'
For all of y'all
We like to play
We like to ball
This is a song
For all of you
When we do our thing
We got to do it true
