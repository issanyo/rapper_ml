[Chorus: Joni Mitchell sample]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Verse 1: Janet]
Have a feeling, now believing that you
Were the one I was meant to be with
Oh how I'm wishing, thinking, dreaming
‘Bout you, and the love
How'd I ever let you get away?

Got til it’s gone…gone

[Chorus: Joni Mitchell sample + Janet]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Verse 2: Janet]
If I could turn back the hands of time
Make you, fall in love, in love with me again
So would you give me another chance to love
To love you, love you the right way, no games

Got til it’s gone…gone…

[Chorus: Joni Mitchell sample + Janet]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Breakdown]

[Chorus: Joni Mitchell sample + Janet]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
