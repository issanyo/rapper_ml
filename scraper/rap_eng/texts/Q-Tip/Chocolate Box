[Intro - Prince (Q-Tip)]
I got a box a chocolates
That will rock the sox of any
Girl that want to come my way

That will rock the socks of any...

That will rock the socks of any...

So, what's the deal, yo you fronting keep it real
Do you want to get funky with me?
If you think I got something that you want
Suga nothing here comes for free

Got lost and found
Let me see if you remember my name
You can try to get it but eye can't let you hit it
Cause you never going to be the same

[Chorus - Prince]

Or are you riding in a limousine?

Skirt your going to get a chance to prove it
You best believe if you want to get with me

[Verse 3 - Q-Tip]
How can I make you mine, if I had the sweetest kind
I can suger brush you in my arms, you’re my love divine
I'm your Willy Wonka, golden ticket is yours
Don’t you wish just to taste from the label report
They say the sweetness you’ll eatum
But the bitter is better
Taken bites from the box
You never know what you getum
But you keep tring and tring, cause the flavour is fun
So many variations from the conscience of one
Where the drums?

[Verse 4 - Prince]
So what's the deal are you gay or popping pills?
Yo you still want to take my hand?
This discotech is about to make me a wreck
My feet are singing louder than the band
I see you got the feeling
Flashing lights up on the ceiling
Say you got to get your weekend now
What difference does it make?
You know you can't make chocolate cake
If ain't nobody ever showed you how

[Chorus - Prince]
I got a box a chocolates
That will rock the sock of any
Girl that want to come my way
And I ain't got no time to waste
If she ain't making bank and scared of
What a brother got to say
I got a box a chocolates
That will rock the sock of any
Girl that want to come my way
And I ain't got no time to waste
If she ain't making bank and scared of
What a brother got to say
