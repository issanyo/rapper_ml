[Verse 1:]
Oh aight
Observe as i see more hundreds than george verms
Hostile take over stickin niggas like germs
My firm i hope you work it out like 12 steps
Got mad depth rappin over the song trickin
Campaigning raised and got these chickens trippin
Rack attack for all you hip hop junkies
The only thing that can hold me down is 12 monkeys
The dj put more than kids shannon briggs
Something gotta give tryin cop the quip last
I won’t show you love show you the crib like das
Steven spielberg is directing this cast
Rappin got me on a ray jack shackin
Me and green bay lewin yeah we stay packin
It’s only right the rep caught a fan like kirk franklin
Million dolla camo more belts than the garter
We sipp chardo fuckas with girls like paris carter

[Chorus:]
Hey yo we gotta get ours no matter what the consequence is
Shawty that’s why i pay my residentials
Hey yo we gotta get ours no matter what the consequence is
Little willy runnin like we stuntin
Hey yo we gotta get ours no matter what the consequence is
Yall niggas stay drippin like strippers
Hey yo we gotta get ours no matter what the consequence is
Smack verse i make you grill like the feds

[Verse 2:]
You saw our success and mad yall niggas dead tanya harten
Cause see our street start in in ya squirrels garden
I’m thirsty you might get scared like jane martin
Flocka flag test the opposite of dolly parton
With the trojan or which round was it
We ghetto roll style make you chillin like sahatas
Fresher i never hold my breath like savannah
I whip this van up they give me brain on some david banner
Now they on house arrest this nigga billy
Cause my willy exhibit genius like maximilian
The rap-putation gives me brain like education
Prim evacuation fire drill style bow
You get exile ya life style cause we who bound ugh ugh
Say what we queens bound so sit down sit down

[Chorus:]
Hey yo we gotta get ours no matter what the consequence is
Yall niggas should stop the fuckin second guess
Hey yo we gotta get ours no matter what the consequence is
Damn money don’t make none
Hey yo we gotta get ours no matter what the consequence is
20 thou keep it movin by the pounds
Hey yo we gotta get ours no matter what the consequence is
Consequence with the crooked tooth smile

[Outro:]
It’s like that baby check
Check me out [x4]
