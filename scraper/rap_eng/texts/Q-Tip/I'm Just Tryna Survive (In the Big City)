[Intro:]
Trying to survive [x3]

[Verse 1:]
So you made it here with everyone
And you dig the fun and the air is fine
But, soon you’ll realize it ain’t so
Cuz big brother’s on your back
And you gotta take control

[Chorus:]
I’m just trying to survive in this big city
You’re just trying to survive oh
And I’m just trying to survive in this big city
You’re just trying to survive oh

[Verse 2:]
I see we’re all in this together
And I see we’re all falling for so many endeavors
Like all on Twitter, IG and Facebook
I don’t know how I got caught in this book

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Ghetto style and the subject is making dollars
But taxes in higher brackets is making me wanna holler
We starving the Marvin
Who’s carving the apple pie we’re eating
Somebody is clearly cheating
Benefits we ain’t receiving
Live legal and must be people trying to be fly like the eagle that’s printed on all our paper
So we plotting holy papers
No, we want to aspire, but nobody’s getting high
Then, we have to be provided so we gotta be surviving

[Chorus:]
I’m just trying to survive in this big city
And I’m just trying to survive
And I’m just trying to survive in this big city
And I’m just trying to survive oh
And you know I am too
(Survive, survive, survive) [x3]
Survive, survive, survive [x3]
Survive
Survive, survive, survive
Survive

[Chorus:]
And I’m just trying to survive in this big city
And you’re just trying to survive oh
And I’m just trying to survive in this big city
And you’re just trying to survive
You know I am too (too, too, too)
(too, too, too, too, too, too)
And I’m just trying to survive in this big city
And I’m just trying to survive
