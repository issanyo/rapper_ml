[Busta Rhymes]
I'm sayin who told y'all to let a muhfucker back on the block
With the bullshit, see y'all done fucked up now
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now
You gotta problem son, imagine how the club sound
Look and see I'm ready to spark it
Soon as I zoom on my target, muhfucker better roll out the carpet
See the way I comin through, and how I kick in the door
Watch how I coffee grind like never before, the way I wreck from the door
So immaculate, passionate, when I'm speakin
I'm preachin, all my niggas out in every hood
You tryin' to compete, you better be incredibly good
Niggas you want heat, I figured you would
That's I waste no time to give it to you niggas (this time)
And give you all the jewels in (this rhyme), and then I put it down to you all
I can't get enough of it niggas, I gotta ex-plore (many)
All of my options, I gotta get me plenty more

[Hook: Marsha & Q-Tip]
Money, cars, clothes, sexy broads, plenty more, go get you some
Mansion, yachts, planes, Phantoms, bitch you better go

[Busta Rhymes]
A lot of niggas shit sound dated
I'm like Shaq, franchise player just got traded
To the number one team in the league
