[Intro]
My king, my king, my, my, my, my
My king, my king, my, my, my, my

[Verse 1]
Where is the throne
For you, whose tender strength can heal a thousand souls
Everyone you touch just (turns to gold)
Many have tried, but you're the one whose noble touch has gently pried
The sword from my heart
Once you, put a smile on the sun
Once you, paved the road for everyone
And you, shed the worries of another
And you, lay your burdens down

[Hook]
Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown, and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you
Just lay your burdens down
Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown, and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you

[Bridge]
To love you, I'm here

[Verse 2]
Go ahead take on the world
I'll be beside you as you vanquish pain and war
Each battlefield transformed now, hope can grow
Oh, this just sure can do what [?], I know even the strongest man needs
Someone to hold him

[Bridge]
Once you, carried all the weight on the shoulder
And you, made a way for the future
Lay your burdens down
Let me love you

[Hook]
Just lay your burdens down
Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown, and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you
Just lay your burdens down
Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown, and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you

I'm here, I'm here

[Hook]
Just lay your burdens down
Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown, and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you
Just lay your burdens down
Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown, and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you

[Outro]
Lay your burdens down, don't even make a sound
I'll be beside you as you vanquish pain and war
So hope can grow
Everyone you touch just turns to gold
I'm here to love you
I want you to know I'll be by your side
I'm here to love you
