[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Loving you came easily
Yet it made me blind to all there was to see
Now my heart is filled with pain
You understand I never will
How did it come to be that you don't love me still?
Now it's getting to be plain

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn't hurt me
If you cared about more than yourself
I bet you wouldn't go
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn't hurt me
If you cared about more than yourself
You wouldn't walk out the door

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Though some days the blues was our parade
Still we marched through all the tears we made
Now I find it wasn't no game of charades that you played
I did my best to bring you joy
How could you just leave me like a broken toy?
Where's the man that once was you?
If I could be within your mind
I would never think to treat you this unkind
The pain you caused will come to you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige + Q-Tip]
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn't hurt me
(I bet you wouldn’t hurt me, I bet you wouldn’t hurt me)
If you cared about more than yourself
I bet you wouldn't go
(You the only thing I care about in the world
Come on, Mary, yo, you know that you my girl)
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn't hurt me
(Mary, yo, tell me really what you mean
‘Cause you know in my world that you’re my queen)
If you cared about more than yourself
You wouldn't walk out the door
(Mary, ain’t nobody that I love more
I ain’t leaving—do you want something from the store?)
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn't hurt me
(Mary Mary, don’t you see me on my knees?
Sit back, gets Alfred on the keys)
If you cared about more than yourself…
If you really cared about anyone else…
If you cared about more than yourself…
If you really cared about anyone else…
If you cared about more than yourself…
(I bet you wouldn’t go; you said you wouldn’t go)
If you really cared about anyone else…
(If you really care, if you really care, if you really care)
If you cared about more than yourself…
(If you really care, oh, oh, oh)
If you really cared about anyone else…
(If you really care, if you really care, if you really cared)
If you cared about more than yourself…
(Then I bet you wouldn’t, no)
If you really cared about anyone else…
(Just set me free, just set me free if you don’t want me)
If you cared about more than yourself…
(If you don’t want me, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn’t hurt me
(I’m tired of singing to you, I’m tired of singing to you, boy)
If you cared about more than yourself…
I bet you wouldn’t go
(Bet you wouldn’t go, bet you wouldn’t go)
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn’t care
(If you really care, I bet you wouldn’t hurt me)
If you cared about more than yourself
(Bet you wouldn’t hurt me, bet you wouldn’t hurt me)
You wouldn’t walk out the door (No, no, come on)
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn’t hurt me
(That’s what you said when you walked into my life
You said you wouldn’t)
If you cared about more than yourself
(You said cared) I bet you wouldn’t go
(But I ain’t scared, no no no no, I’m not scared)
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn’t hurt me
(I know, I know, I know you wouldn’t hurt me)
If you cared about more than yourself…
(I know you wouldn’t hurt me, if you cared)
You wouldn’t walk out the door
