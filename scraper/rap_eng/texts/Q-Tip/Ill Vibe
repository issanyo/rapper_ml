[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
My rhymes create life like the birds and the bees
Make Funkmaster Flex say 'Yo, I'm feeling these'
Flows make you shit in your drawers. Change your dungarees
Smoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munchies
Bounce down the block, eat food at Luigi's
Ass constipated... too much extra cheese
But anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's
I met some Siamese twins from overseas.. Lebanese
Lesbians with the friends from New Orleans
They had a fifth friend, she was straight Black-Portuguese
Pretty palm-olive-soaped skin, Aloe Vera leaves
She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
The type of chick you would KILL for to get between the knees
Yo. I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese
Would you believe the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys
And rob me for my G's
Had to show this crazy broad I mastered my degrees and my Ph.D's
Got your face on camera; motherfucker say cheese
You better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze
Getting caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees

[Hook: Busta Rhymes & [Q-Tip]]
I caught that ill vibe Tip [word Bust?] yo yo word
That ill vibe Tip [word Bust?] yo yo word
Cause when I'm in the place you know my shit be absurd
[I caught that ill vibe Bust] Word Tip? [yo yo word]
[That ill vibe Bust] Word Tip? [yo yo word]
[So when I hold the mic you know my shit be absurd]
[I caught that ill vibe Bust] Word Tip? [yo yo word]

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I got weight on my shoulders in the form of this beat
Ain’t nothin' sweet, on the street, for good deeds I compete
Come on complete, and unique, so get back in your stance
We enhance and we're playing the whole world circumstance
So do good in your hood even though you puff lah
Positive to comply
Don’t screw face and act rah
Progress, don't fall back. We can't have that
I'll hold your hand, Black
We can't wind up with scratch
I put my best foot forward as I play this life
'Cause this world is bound to get ya like a double-edged knife
In the jam we regulate, 'cause we organize
Logic-a-lly thinking when along's enterprise
A lot of brothers from the ghetto got the gift of gab
Peace to the West Coast and the East, we fab
Need I make mention that the crew we've got
Make things get hot, like the FoFo shot. Blaow!
No, we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek
In the world that we live, kindness is viewed as weak
So, we got to stay on point for all these lizards and snakes
Some of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes
We decipher all the frauds and build grounds with our friends
Why's that?
So we can live right until time ends
Yo, why's that?
Amalgamate, so we can get these ends
Yo, true that
Busta and Tip, you know we make minds bend
