This song is for you
If you feel blue
Know someone is caring for you
Caring for you
Caring for you
Don't be blue (Don't be blue)
If somebody's says it's not true
Tell them you do
Have someone who's caring for you

This song is for you
If you feel blue
Know someone is caring for you
Caring for you
Caring for you
Don't be blue (Don't be blue)
If somebody's says it's not true
Tell them you do
Have someone who's caring for
Caring for you

(Thank you God)
