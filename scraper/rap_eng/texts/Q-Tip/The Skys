(Intro)

It's something real ain't it
When you think you best is your worst


Yea

(First Verse)

Role playing
I'm something like
Dicaprio,  rosario
I had to go, i had to row
Dawsans creek
I eat the she sleep
I peak down them sheets
She running man It won't sleeping
I'm all along I can't leave don't
Don't know the answers can't cheat
I checkin out out her mental
But only her menstaral
Cause when men stroke
Its like a god when the wind blows
Safe build up for cresendos

(Pre-chorus)
Her pen goes splish splash
She can't deal wit the riff raft c
Can't get out this life
But a hoes no wife
Si se pethde mami
BEAR THOSE STRIPES


(Hook)
When you never really rolling
And you all on you own
And you never really know
Where you wanna go
It's all there for the taking and she all theirs for the taking
She likes the lights the life the shine in her eyes
And I don't know why
But she wants me
And I want her
So let's make this something we won't remember

(IDK ro Verse 2)
We'll be up all night if we get at it
Put you up in the spread eagle
My own acrobatic
If we start the. We gotta finish
Ain't no telling when we ending
Girl I swear we'll be insomniacs
If I get up in it

(Mac Nealy)
If he in it
The he winning
I ain't giving
I ain't tripping
I ain't simpin
I decide I had to let her kno
I she wanna ride we can ride
Now we ride
But she lied at the time of her ridicule

(Pre chorus)
Her pain goes splish splash
She can't deal wit the riff raft c
Can't get out this life
But a hoes no wife
Si se pethde mami
BEAR THOSE STRIPES

(Hook)

(Vamp)
Here we go yo (x2)
So what's the scenario
(X2)

(Third verse)
It's an independent mission and we got the good here never or the left cause the rights my good ear
I could give a damn about a ILL subliminal
Stay away from clowns so I ain't no criminal
Two Types of riches
Two types of bitches
I could give a damn all you types of glitches
What's a war with out a truce
And what's a gun with no shooter
