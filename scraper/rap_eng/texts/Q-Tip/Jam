Word

Word up
(Can you dig?)

(Ha, ya know what I'm sayin'? A'ight yo, I should go)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, & Consequence]
It was Friday afternoon in the middle of June
Heineken bottle caps and the aroma of boom
Around the time everybody just got home from class
Shooting dice, talkin shit, hoping the cash would last
Yo, this was around the time when I didn't know no better
Juney moved around in a tinted out Jetta

Then he introduced me to that hydro smoke
And I took one toke, yo, I almost choked
See I never smoked before so my nerves got shot
Then he told me about the party at the spot Jamroc
It was guaranteed on but I said "Son, chill"
There's a joint around the way that's supposed to be real
Word

He said we got all day, so we gonna do it right
Hit your man's joint first and Jamrock in one night
Then I said "Aight", then I hopped inside the jetty
Let me take a shower, I'm sweaty, and then I'll be ready
Tonight is the night I get my groove on steady
And get my drink on with that Ford named Betty
I went upstairs to get fly, smoke my Thai
Drunk some liquor, to meet my high quicker
Now, I'm type stimo, the party is the M.O
Me and my crew, we get it started like a demo
Eleven in the evening, I'm feelin like a heathen
This thing is going down and I highly doubt I'm leaving
Booty cheeks are in motion and the kids was drinking potion
Word is bond, that Black Moon joint got me open
(Don't front)

Yo, the DJ flipped the script
Threw on the good shit that made the kid lose his grip
Blendin Risin to the Top and got these shorties hoppin
Number coppin', ain't no stoppin me now
Yo, I'm bound to win until that thing kicked in
The Aliz√© had me stuck, I don't know where to begin

[Verse 2: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, & Consequence]
Now I'm feeling kinda jaded, wild incoherent
Me and the fellas started acting irreverent
Butt grabbin, mad laughin, just assin
Then that chick caught up, the shorty looking fed up
They said you jonesin' with this one, gibbin' with that one
A yo, I'm just doing my thing, yo I'm just having fun
You don't see me in here wylin pulling out no gun
Yo, I see some of that thing girl and I want some
So let's step inside this corner so that we can rap on
Over this bumpin' ass song plus some Dom Perignon
I hit ya with the good lovin plus fillet mignon
Yeah, yeah scrammy scrams, that's that same old song
Aye yo, tell me why the hell your breath smells so strong
Yo, put some brakes on your yappin or you won't live long
Please nigga, push on
Alright scrams, see you later (scrams?)
Can't mess with these street sharks or these alligators
I can't take it no more, yo it's damn near four
I've been partyin and drinkin since I came out my door
Look at these kids about to mix it, damn, where's the exit?
Son, jetted to the ride and got the burner out the Lexus
Yo, he cocked his joint back like he's about to let him have it
Kid, I kept it movin like the Energizer rabbit
A yo yo, it's time to skate, ain't no time to contemplate
(all: Whoops, looka there, there's Jake)
