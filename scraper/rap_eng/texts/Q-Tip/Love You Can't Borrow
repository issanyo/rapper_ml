[Intro: M-1]
If you want me to stay
Then I'll be here today
Nobody's promised tomorrow


[Verse 1: M-1]
See I'm the type of dude to put it on the line
Not to be rude but I just want to make you mine
Don't want to own you, but to love you would be fine
Don't walk away cause' see this ain't another lie
See I'm the serious type, I don't believe in the hype
So sit beside me baby, tell me what you like
And you a fine sight, a water sign
What you got on your mind?
A man who know just what he want is what you're sure to find
You gotta go, you makin moves, you on the grind
Another life, another day, there ain't no time
You gotta make time,make life, make love
Because a dream is just reality  you think of
This ain't a mind game shorty this is mind sex
Get out the rain sweet thang, fore' you get wet
I'm here to serve and protect, cause you deserve some respect
I'm just a soldier for your love to the death

[Hook: Cassandra Wilson]
If you want me to stay
Then I'll be here today
Nobody's promised tomorrow
If you say I love you
Then you better be true
This kind of love you can't borrow


[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
And there ain't no need to think about it
Evil people wanna throw the hexes on their love
My eyes on the prize and I know we comin up
And if we hit the point, Then we gon' double up
If we havin issues we gon' huddle up
If you by yourself and you sense trouble huh
Dudes know when I step through
The only way to handle this thing is like a Zulu
And I'm bangin for your lovin'
You my family, you second to nothin
And we all were together, lookin for forever, through this bad weather
No matter what it is in my life
If I give you my love you better know that's right
It's me and you through the fightin and cussin
It's me and you together ain't no discussion

[Hook]


[Verse 3: M-1]
See I'm a make it sound sweet for real
Nobody sayin nothin' we can feel
Take you higher than weed or pills or cheap thrills
I'm talkin bout we court our zone, can we build?
Look how I love you is reduced to
"Hey yo let me holla at you boo!"
Sad but true weve gotten used too
Do as I say, not as I do
See what you say, you gotta mean it
Ain't no mountain high enough to get between it
Anything collect dust if you don't clean it
Don't talk about, be about it, bring it
Don't make it something that your doin' every now and then
And like my best friend I haven't seen since I was 10
You never met the power we put out from deep within
Well I'm a let Cassandra Wilson sing it to ya then

[Hook]
