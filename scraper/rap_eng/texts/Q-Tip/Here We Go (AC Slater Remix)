And I think I have the last laugh
And I'll pass class
Told them I was done with it
Opposite Of Adult, let's have fun with it
I'm a genius, and so is Xaphoon
Stay up, nocturnal shit, raccoon
Rap soon, holla at you later
They say we bout to blow up, Al-Qaeda
And this track was just a favor
That turned into a classic, Slater
I run rap like a master dater
You take forever to make a procrastinator
Blind niggas can't see shit
And he a story of Victoria Secret
That's only if she keep it
Never mistake kindness for weakness

[Q-Tip]
