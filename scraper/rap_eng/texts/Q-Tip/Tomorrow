Yeah, yeah, seriously? I kinda like that

Now in most places when you wake up when the sun goes down People usually frown but
When you jumpin' off it usually doesn't make a diff-diff-difference
And since me and you is the hottest things in here we gon' get down and dance dance spin you around like Fred Astaire

I recognize all day and night
But tomorrow I got the day off (up late and I feel alright)
I've waited for this all week long
Wake up all my friends and we blast off every tone

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be up all night
Cause I don't have to work tomorrow
Llegamos hasta las ocho
Wake up as the sun goes down
The new night is just beginning
And we'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow

Tonight I got almost infinite time
To love until I'm good and to dance until I'm high
Without a worry on my mind
Without a worry on my mind
Cause I can do my thing 'til the sun begins to shine

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be up all night
Cause I don't have to work tomorrow
Llegamos hasta las ocho
Wake up as the sun goes down
The new night is just beginning
And we'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow

Isn't it funny how the moon can always look-look different than the, different than the night before
When you saw this, when we movin', move again and it's [?] standing up than standing still but all well's well
Equal destiny, feed the hunger, you know I want ya
And I propose [?], make your toes tap, [?] work, lose that, [?]

Tonight I feel free, I'm free up tomorrow, whatever it brings
Ooooh, 'cause when tomorrow ends, and it starts again
Another night's to follow
So follow me yeah, and never stop

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be up all night
Cause I don't have to work tomorrow
Llegamos hasta las ocho
Wake up as the sun goes down
The new night is just beginning
And we'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow

I'm gonna be up all night
Cause I don't have to work tomorrow
Llegamos hasta las ocho
Wake up as the sun goes down
The new night is just beginning
And we'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow

I'm gonna be up all night
Cause I don't have to work tomorrow
Llegamos hasta las ocho
Wake up as the sun goes down
The new night is just beginning
And we'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow

Oh yeah, oh yeah, I don't have to work tomorrow
Oh yeah, oh yeah, Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and
