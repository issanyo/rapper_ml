[Large Professor]
Yo.. Yeah
Nowhere to run to nowhere to hide
Sittin' on the front stoop right outside
In the moonlight when I take flight I fly
Crank the engine, then I break out like I'm benchin'
Thousands of pounds spit thousands of rounds
And verses help 'em out like a found missin' person
This time I'mma try to lounge on the cursin'
So people can hear how my rap sound perfect
Could hate a nigga but in fact it's not worth it
Never know how long you've got on this earth kid
Count them blesses and pay them dues
Keep rollin' with the winners cause they don't lose
In the two G-era the skies is looking clearer
And nothing can stop them guys that's in the mirror
So thankful that I keep my hands on the bankroll
Can't play the shit wreck, falling of the plankroll
So I stay stable like a natural born hustler
Kickin' that hot shit right for all the customers
Near or far comin' here to star
I'll be pourin' out beer in the park
For my loved ones
Deep and thick is how my love runs for you
So with no further ado
I'mma smash it kick that shit they call acid
24 hours a day remain classic

[Q-Tip]
I arise from my melinence to the sun beginning
Kiss by the ray of a sunny day
But I feel it in my bone, a child's without a home
A prison cell holds a dream to a black teen
I never thought I'd see the day when brothers pledge allegiance
To a red white and blue that's wavin' untrue
Yo, where's the forty acres and the mule, huh?
You rather give us Mickey D's and a tool, huh?
And in the sun I see the way you pull our hearts' strings
And in the sun I see your old way to new things
Every man has to bow down to God's grace
Every soul has to concede to God's goal
Politicians get religious to a starved people
As the constitution reads, it says I'm not equal
Three fifths of the gifts from a love supreme
This gotta be a bad dream, I'm hearing trains scream
Little kids are getting warped from computer thoughts
Family structure is destroyed, marriage null and void
All has gotten formulated, really hate to say it
But I can see it easy, really, in the sun

[Hook] without LP

[Large Professor]
Yo don't ever think I've forgotten
Them days black plottin'
And schemin'
Sittin' in the lunchroom
Eatin' and dreamin'
On about the things we do
When we reach independence
Nothing is brand new
It's all still accordin' to plan
Meet your man
From decades ago can't nobody understand
The hardships we've been through
Sun to sun
On the wake up knock knock
Everybody gotta run for the ultimate goal
Can't lose they soul
In the process
So and to you I say God bless
Seeing your face lets me see my own
So I zone, and think about the days we got stoned
In the staircase of apartment buildings
Little childrens
Growing in a world so cold
Just like pilgrims, we migrate daily
Now a days we rarely get to see one another
But when we connect we still brothers
And now we in the corporate world
And the game is different
You get caught up in the twirl
If your fam ain't affective
So here's our perspective
To help each other
Cause man ain't it hectic
