[Chorus:]
High
Low
Closed or open toe
You be looking good when you rock 'em so
Put your heels on, girl
Them heels on, lady
Get your grind hard
You drive me crazy

[Verse 1:]
Palms get sweaty, I'm imagining things
When I see what reality brings
I get choked from your vision uncomparable
So dime, a man, I could write a parable
Killing when I go back to my rat hole living
Michaelangelo, you're on the ceiling
That outfit you're wearing
With them pretty eyes wherein
I can see your mind's eye staring
Planning on changing the world just like me
You could be the chairwoman
And I'll be the trustee
Let me give all for your benefit
Then I'll get blessed out my deficit

[Hook:]
Heels
High heels
Real heels

[Verse 2:]
Ball hard
Blue jeans fitted
'69 Caddy, fully kitted
Muscle, cool town taught you about the hustle
Went away to school
You packed your duffle
You had them sexy little heels for that frat house
Damn
You want a little boy or little man?
Then only for you to even think to doubt
How your heels set it off when you toe up out

[Hook]

[Chorus] (2x)

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
When you walk around the streets
Men and women break their strides
And want to see
Schoolgirl jeans
[?]
You're the star that's going far
I'm [?]
When you stroll
Those streaming eyes
Clarity comes from you
And [?]

But them heels
Them heels
Whoa
Them heels
Them heels
Them heels
