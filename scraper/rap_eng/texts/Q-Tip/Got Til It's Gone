[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
On and on it seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

[Verse 1: Marsha Ambrosius]
Have a feeling, now believing; that you
Were the one I was meant to be with
Oh how I'm wishing; thinking, dreaming of you
To the fact I was meant to be that way

[Pre-Chorus]
(On and on) Got until it's gone (On and on)
(Songstress never lies)
(On and on) Got until it's gone (On and on)
(Songstress never lies, let's go)

[Chorus]
On and on it seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
(Say what, say what)
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

[Verse 2: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could turn back the hands of time
Make you, fall in love, with me again
So would you give me, another chance to love
To love you, the right way, come again

[Pre-Chorus]
(On and on) Got until it's gone (On and on)
(Songstress never lies)
(On and on) Got until it's gone (On and on)
(Songstress never lies, let's go)

[Chorus]
On and on it seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
On and on it seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
On and on it seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
On and on it seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

[Rap: TWyse]
I'm a God fellow, to the eyes, an odd fellow
I'm the new breed in this league, I'm Carmelo
And I mean that in more than one way: I'm carmel and yellow
But that ain't what I'm here to promote...nope!
I see you sinking, skipper
So I went and bought you a boat
And I call it the Titanic
In crisis, the captain of the ship, so don't panic
'Cause we ain't drowning
I don't care what it looks like, we ain't drowning
In my life, I done met Katrina's sister
They brought racket like Venus and Serena sister, but...
Since I'm a boxer, I just roll with the punches
I don't do a lot of ducking, I stay in, man
And if I get knocked down, I stand again
Once I get back up, up...
Now put that in your brain like a back-up
For when you think you can't get back up, New Orleans get back up

[Pre-Chorus]
(On and on) (Yeah) (On and on) On and on
(On and on) (On and on) On and on
(Songstress never lies)

[Chorus]
On and on it seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
On and on it seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
On and on it seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
On and on it seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
