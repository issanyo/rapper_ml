[Verse 1: Janet]
Have a feeling, now believing that you
Were the one I was meant to be with
Oh how I'm wishing, thinking, dreaming
‘Bout you, and the love
How'd I ever let you get away?

Gone, yeah...

[Verse 2: Janet]
If I could turn back the hands of time
Make you, fall in love, in love with me again
So would you give me another chance to love
To love you, love you the right way, no games

Gone...gone...gone...

[Q-Tip]
Gone, right? Settle down
For beef...and beach
Cold jonesin’
Ringing my house, hanging up and imposing
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that, and do that, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that, do that?

[Janet]
Got 'til it’s gone (gone)
Got 'til it’s gone (gone)
Got 'til it’s gone (gone)
Got 'til it’s gone

[Repeat Verse 1: Janet]
Have a feeling, now believing that you
Were the one I was meant to be with
Oh how I'm wishing, thinking, dreaming
‘Bout you, and the love
How'd I ever let you get away?

[Chorus: Joni Mitchell sample]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go (Joni Mitchell never lies)
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Repeat Verse 2: Janet]
If I could turn back the hands of time
Make you, fall in love, in love with me again
So would you give me another chance to love
To love you, love you the right way, no games

[Chorus: Joni Mitchell sample]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go (Joni Mitchell never lies)

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Janet + (Joni)]
Got 'til it's gone (Don't know what you got 'til it's gone)
Got 'til it's gone (Don't know what you got 'til it's gone)

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
I heard he swims with this chick on the beach
Cold jonesin’
Ringing my house, hanging up and imposing
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that?

[Janet + (Q-Tip)]
Got 'til it's gone (Yeah yeah)
