In the city of, roses
Streets lined with red brick, and green branches
Wouldn't run at days that might seem weak
Or ...the pain that makes the land ...and the folks unique
City parks, wild berries, and old bridges
Rolling... silently watching over me
And everywhere I go these... are with me
Yeah and I find
I take along a little piece of heaven, with these memories of mine
From the city of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses

Down along the river, we can mark it
Soon as ... the water front come...
All the people you could wish for or imagine
From the ... in the city, ... to make sure that there's a thriving jazz scene
And everywhere I go these... are with me
Yeah and I find
I take along a little piece of heaven, with these memories of mine
From the city of roses, city of roses
And everywhere I go these... are with me
Yeah and I find
Wherever am I driving, I take with me, these memories of mine
From the city of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
