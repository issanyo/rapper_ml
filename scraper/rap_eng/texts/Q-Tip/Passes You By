[Intro]
Yo, we’ve been seeing each other for a while
And one of the things I really appreciate about you
Is that when we in public
You be acting all shy and reserved and unsuspecting
But when the muh’fuckin’ door closes, that freak come out
You be gettin’ it, gettin’ in

[Verse 1]
I was running my way, you know, the paper chase
Dot my I’s and crossing my T’s
Being raised in the hood, nigga, you knew that I would
Catch shorty as she start to breeze
Way she walked was awkward, and that made me be forward
I usually don’t do what I’m about to now do
She rocked her glasses and had to pass her classes
Her last semester, her parents were investors
She seemed so shy but she had, something underneath of all that
Could tell from the scent of her person
Her ears perked when I started cursin’
I said, “Excuse me,” her best imitation of bourgeois
“Let’s watch a movie, allow me to pursue thee”
Hung out on broke day, stared at me in strange ways
I stared back, she held hand, and unfazed, she star-gazed
Mmm, and damn, she lookin’ so good, and…
I’m fucked up, fam

[Chorus]
She’s so understated, she passes you by
She really is quiet, she really is shy
But when we’re alone, y’all, you know what’s the deal
She jets ‘til I go blind so I have to feel
She’s so understated, she passes you by (By, by, ow)

[Verse 2]
People wanna know about the things you do
Because you’re so quiet that you make ‘em say “ooh”
Never really know where you’re coming from
And you don’t say much and you are not dumb
Unlike other girls of your generation
Don’t go on about your occupation
Low margin on the conversation
No yap yap yap, no, you ain’t like that
Got a whole lotta knowledge, you’s a wild diaspora
And we hardly see you so we call you Casper
And I really really think that you think about me
When you drift to the place that the people can’t see
When you’re driving back home in your car alone
When you read a book or hit that zone
Know your homeboy ain’t far away
Know your homeboy is here to stay
Know your homeboy gon’ make it okay
Know your homeboy ain’t far away
Know your homeboy is here to stay
Know your homeboy gon’ make it okay, come on

[Chorus]
She’s so understated, she passes you by
(Oh, she passes you by, y’all)
She really is quiet, she really is shy
But when we’re alone, y’all, you know what’s the deal
She jets ‘til I go blind so I have to feel
She’s so understated, she passes you by (By, by, come on)

[Verse 3]
Now here we are in closing
Your cool lifestyle’s imposing
But never in the bad way
‘Cause I know this ain’t play play
You save them for the closed door
Which makes me want to stay more
You really keep me intrigued
My heart is strong, not putty
Now I can’t wait ‘til later
When you become my savior
And we become the flavor
The envy to our neighbors
Our mission isn’t perverse
Then every night is clockwork
But never is it rehearsed
We do it then we reverse
Never is it rehearsed
Every night is clockwork
Our mission isn’t perverse
The envy to our neighbors
And we become the flavor
When you become my savior
And I can’t wait ‘til later
My heart is strong, not putty
You really keep me intrigued
This makes me want to stay more
You save it for the closed door
‘Cause I know this ain’t play play
But never in the bad way
Your cool lifestyle’s imposing
But here we are in closing
In closing…in closing…and here we are in closing
In closing…in closing…and here we are in closing
In closing…in closing…and here we are in closing
In closing…in closing…and here we are in closing

[Outro]
Just shake, shake, just shake it
Come on, come on, just shake it, shake it
Just do it, let’s do it, do it
Just do it, ah, let’s do it, do it
Ah, let’s do it
Let’s do it, just shake it, shake it
Let’s do it, do it, do it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Ah, let’s do it, do it…
