[Intro]
Listen to the bass
Listen to the bass
Listen to the bass
Stanley on the bass
Stanley Clarke to the bass
1, 2, to the bass
1, 2, to the bass
1, 2, to the bass

[Verse 1]
1, 2, to the bass, you gotta elevate your mind
Look inside and you'll find all your answers to your outs
Damage to your mind and your grind you can't have
So you must eradicate it some way, no doubt
Some blow trees, others take to their knees
In the gloomiest of times for the hope of sunlit
Some get lost, some lights blew the cross
While others get through spark plugs in the pit
By in the pit I mean steppin' away from the scene
And recharging all the batteries you have inside
And entering the new with all signs you grew
In tact, in fact, you just stayed in touch
Touch

[Verse 2]
1, 2, to the bass, I gotta ignore the pace
Of the next man and work on my natural goal
Diggin' on my God given me in the way that'll shine
To everybody, and perhaps you all know
Feeling my connection to the rest of the globe
When somebody cries there it's a tear over here
Standing up for moral, the freedom of a being
Standing up to the powers, not submitting in fear
By in fear I mean stepping away off the scene
And not doing my thing, doing my thing for love
If love ain't supported then my life gets aborted
We resort to instincts that will leave us all done

[Verse 3]
1, 2, to the bass, I gotta ignore the pace
Of the next man and work on my natural goal
Diggin' on my God given me in the way that'll shine
To everybody, and perhaps you all know
Feeling my connection to the rest of the globe
When somebody cries there, it's a tear over here
Standing up for moral, the freedom of a being
Standing up to the powers, not submitting in fear
By in fear I mean stepping away off the scene
And not doing my thing, doing my thing for love
If love ain't supported then my life gets aborted
We resort to instincts that will leave us all done
If love ain't supported then my life gets aborted
We resort to instincts that will leave us all done
If love ain't supported then my life gets aborted
We resort to instincts that will leave us all done
If love ain't supported then my life gets aborted
We resort to instincts that will leave us all done
If love ain't supported then my life gets aborted
We resort to instincts that will leave us all done
