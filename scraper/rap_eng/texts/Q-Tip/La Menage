[Intro: Dres]
Listen, hon, I mean, ah, as slamming as you are and all that good stuff, it ain't doing me no good out here because...
You have too many clothes on
So why don't we just take this cab and uh, slide on uptown and uh, slip outta all of this uncomfortableness of the world around us
Do you know what, you know what I am saying babes?
Matter of fact, uhhhhh...

[Verse 1: Dres]
Listen to me honey
Ah, honey listen here please
If sexy were a virus
Then you'd have a disease
Slamming is your styling
Let me speak for a while and
Tell you all about the grand slamming
(Why you smiling?)
Let's do the uptown slide
Don't need a transfer or auto ride
We only need a cab with us inside
Finally finally we got uptown
And when we got uptown
Honey's drawers came down
Did the audio visual
She had the residuals
Bah bah Dres, now tell me have U.N.E. Pull
I said honey, uhhh, again I said it slow
Coming out the boxers and my joint will surely grow
Then she started feeling
Yes, it was appealing
I thought of slamming girlfriend from the floor to the ceiling
We started five play
She said that she would come
I said it wasn't four play
Because I used my thumb
Nibbled on her neck
Oh, what the heck
She said, 'One two, one two' and went down for a mike check
Her mike sounds nice check one
Her mike sounds nice check two
She did this 'til it was all gone
I told her to slow down
But she kept on

[Hook]
And on, and on, and on, she kept on
And on, and on, and on, she kept on
(You gotta do something about those wisdom teeth baby)
And on, and on, and on, she kept on
Though you're sounding as good as a CD

[Verse 2]
[Dres]
Everything was Dolby, or rather all's OK
She was playing Frito and I play the Lay
Then I heard a knock only to hear a voice say...
[Mista Lawnge]
Yo, you can't have a show without the DJ
I entered in my drawers
To show that I was live
The ho didn't believe that I was nine point five
She said, 'Let me see it Lawnge, may I see it please?'
I said, 'Yeah, get a good look. Drop to your knees.'
I was erectified. I gave her the proof
And then I suggested a little woof woof
She was uptight, I said, 'Hon, there's nothing wrong
I'm the sugar dick daddy Mista Lawnge
Don't get offended by the position I recommended
Doggy style is my shit
The bottom is what I hit
I didn't eat her
Or Rita, just beat her
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita
Uhhhhhhh!

[Verse Three: Q-Tip]
Tip and Sugar Dick, blazing trails of evil
Lawnge, you got the felts 'cause I sure 'nough got the needle
Now put them on the arm that protrudes like a stick
And live up to your label Mista Lawnge Sugar Dick
As the dookie hits the fan, in comes the horny man
To finish up the task, so I'm scopin' out that ass
Lawnge, she wants it
Her hands spreads the butt cheeks
Tip plus Lawnge plus the ho equals wet sheets

[Outro]
God damn
Yo, somebody give me
A horny time
Somebody give me a hole
Spread the ass
Just give me a hole
No man
Somebody give me a hole
I'm gonna come in your face
Somebody give me a hole
I'm coming, in your face
Somebody give me a hole
I'm gonna come in your face
Somebody give me a hole
Bitch just let me pee on you
Let me pee on you
Let me pee on you
Somebody give me a hole
I've got the anal tongue darts
I've got the anal tongue darts
Let me pee on you
Somebody give me a hole
Ahhhhhhhh
I can't hold it no more

[Hook]
And on, and on, and on, she kept on (Repeat until fade)
