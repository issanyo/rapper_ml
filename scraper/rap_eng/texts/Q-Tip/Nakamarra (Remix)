[Verse 1: Hiatus Kaiyote]
Hannah my darling
I will follow you into the sunrise under desert sky
We fly, rise together
With our hearts upon our sleeves for all to see
We two will breathe, aqua queen though vast distance between us
Heart sails with love for you
I love you, I love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do
Nakamarra sweet red earth will hold you
Like the strength you bless to me
True we engage humility, watch me struggle with your words
However truthful they may be
We'll see in time, opening our hearts
And nurturing our minds to shine
I love you, love you, I love you I do...
Love you, I love you, I love you I do...

[Verse 3: Hiatus Kaiyote]
Oh, it sets our hearts to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know, it sets our heart to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know we too will pulse in through this light
Honey don't you know we too will pulse
I'll always love you, love you, love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do

[Hook: Q-Tip & Hiatus Kaiyote]
I'm speaking to you all from the most natural of habitats
White city, ghost jokes
To be something like razorbacks
Talk about us quietly
Your rich social quarters
Bout a fertile land in a roll of lush waters
And they really should embrace us
Cause they know we got science
But the bottom line is
They don't want the brown alliance
They'd rather get our secrets
And little bully, mistreat us
Take our color and our culture
From the foul way they breed us
They are e-fucking-litists
With no intention to free us
And if you believe in love
Then imagine what the key is
The sentiment from me simply, love me
Love you I do, love you I, love you I do

[Verse 3: Hiatus Kaiyote]
Oh, it sets our hearts to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know, it sets our heart to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know we too will pulse in through this light
Honey don't you know we too will pulse
I'll always love you, love you, love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do...
Yeah yeah yeah...
