..."The Return of the Dragon"?!
So you gon' hit niggas with all that
Motherfucking "Rah Rah"
You gon' eat niggas' food
You gon' come through, like, disrepectful on these joints B?
(I mean...) Please tell me that...

[Busta Rhymes]
I mean..., you know I recently just showed muhfuckers that, you know...
I had to go in the stash box for real
Because a nigga went and got the C-town shopping cart
And filled the bitch up with a bunch of hard drives
Just to show niggas that we back in our bag, Kamaal Fareed!
(Right, right) You knowamean?
So I'm definitely gonna show niggas
What the way of the dragon is really about...
...by giving 'em "Return of the Dragon: THE ABSTRACT WENT ON VACATION"

(Both laugh)

[Q-Tip]
Why it gotta be a C-Town, ghetto-ass cart nigga?

[Busta Rhymes]
Because...  That's what the fuck we do
We show niggas what the filth be 'bout
So we can slap they ass wit' a filthy sock
In they fucking face and let them understand
What this timeless greatness
'Cause sometimes a nigga need to smacked wit' the filthy sock
Not the clean sock
We slap the shit out a nigga with that stink
You know, that fucking nasty donkey foot shit
Then they get the reminder that they need

[Q-Tip]
So let me get the visual my nigga
(Yeah beloved)
So, it's like it's the blackout
And you went to C-Town
And you got the C-Town cart
And you been out all night and shit, grabbin' shit up
Now the sun hit niggas
You movin' down the street... (more or less)
Rudeboy... ([?] me I say topshotter)
Wit' the fuckin' dirt-sock on your left shoulder then...
(No, me left foot)
Your left foot then... (yes, topshotter)
And you push the C-Town cart full of fucking grenades...
(Yeah, full of grenades)
And you walk down the street
And you blow upon a chalice, see...
(Yes, rudeboy, you know that)
And it, and, and, and then the police
They rolled down and you look at them
And you go "Raawwwr"

[Busta Laughs Histerically] ...Yeah
