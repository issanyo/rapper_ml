[Sampled Intro]
(We're going to dance)
(We're going to dance)
(We're going to dance and have some fun)

[Intro: (Bootsy Collins)]
(Dig!)

[Verse 1: Lady Miss Kier, (Bootsy Collins), ((Q-Tip))]
The chills that you spill up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another (You know that's right)
Your groove I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge
My supper dish, my succotash wish ((Sing it, baby))
I couldn't ask for another ((Uh huh, uh huh))
[Slide whistle]
No, I couldn't ask for another
[Slide whistle]

[Chorus: Lady Miss Kier, (Bootsy Collins)]
[Slide whistle]
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart (Astronomical)
Groove is in the heart
(Watch out)

[Verse 2: Lady Miss Kier]
The depth of hula groove
Moves into the tenth hoop
We're gonna groove to Horton Hears a Who-who
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
I couldn't ask for another
[Slide whistle]

[Verse 3: Q-Tip, (Bootsy Collins)]
Unh, some looks in this torso, yeah
Hot, got a deal, you wanna know, wanna know
Delightful, truly delightful, lightful
Makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show, show
Feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze, haze
Music makes motion, moves like a maze, maze
All inside of me, side, heart especially, yeah
Note of the rhythm, where I wanna be, c'mon
Flowin', glowin' with electric eyes, eyes
You dip to the dive, baby yo, realize, yeah
When will you see the funky side of me?
Baby, you'll see that rhythm is the key, yeah
Get, get, wit' it, wit' it, can't think, quit it, quit it
Stomp on the streets when I hear a funk beat, bloop
Playin' pop like follow hoods true
Baby, just sing about the groove (Sing it)

[Chorus: Lady Miss Kier]
Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)
Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)
Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)
Groove is in the heart
[Slide whistle]
(One, two, three)

[Ad lib: Q-Tip, (Bootsy Collins)]
Blow them horns along
(The groove is in your heart)

[Chorus: Lady Miss Kier, (Bootsy Collins)]
Groove is in the heart (yeah)
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart

[Outro: Spoken]
Hmmmmm
He he he he
C'mon, y'all deep
Y'all are crazy, man
