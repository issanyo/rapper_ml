[Hook: Lax Louis]

Love, love, love x6

[Verse 1: Lax Louis]

I met a fine chick, I was just sixteen
Low confidence cause she wasn't 'round enough,
I said girl, how the hell do you fit them jeans
You a 9.5 but I'm rounding up,
Got a little dream honey, and I'mma make it big,
I'm thinking I can label you the mother to my kids,
You down girl
Thought we knew it was real,
Now I see we was just young and stupid as hell,
But for real
How could I even tie that knot
I mean I had a wife then, she was named Hip-Hop,
And she happily provided for a minimum wage
Only thing she ask is that I spill my ink on the page
And I did,
So I got to father the game
Even though it bore me, just a fatherless Wayne,
Used to want to blow up, now I got to,
That's why I married Hip-Hop sweetie, not you

[Verse 2: Lax Louis]

My first love
Was keeping me on top of the green,
Might have been a little slutty
I was part of the team,
I was always pushing weight, and I was tossing the rock
And even if my teachers knew, they wasn't calling the cops,
But yo, I used to love it when we both touched down
And I ain't really care if the whole team got around,
All I really cared about is I was ballin' a lot
Made the other girls mad, they was all on my jock,
But yo, I used to run shit with this old broad,
Til I couldn't hit no more
My knee's all gone,
If you don't know now
Man I'm talking 'bout a game,
Cause Football used to be always on my brain
But injurie's a bitch,
It opened up my eyes
All I need to make it is some hella dope rhymes,
Little touch of old school
Bringing back the Tribe,
But now I'm feeling true Hip-Hop ain't alive,
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back ya'll
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back ya'll,
Cause I miss being three hearing good music
I just want to reminisce on the past ya'll
