[Intro]
It's Fine
Fine, Fine, Fine, Fine
It's Alright

[Verse 1]
Had a dream last night
That the world stopped turning
But your madness, it kept on
Guess I wasn't too bright
And I really wasn't learning
Should have seen it all along

[Pre-Chorus]
All those sweet, sweet kisses and those sweet red roses
They convinced me that it was you
I made you exclusive
Now it's so conclusive
That you wasn't doing it too

[Chorus]
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine (It would have been fine)
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time
(Would've had a good time)
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine (I would've been fine)
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time

[Verse 2]
Something didn't feel right
And I wish I knew it
I just could not see your games
I got respect for you
And you put me through it
Why would you bring me so much pain?

[Pre-Chorus]
I would still love for you 'cause I did adore you
While my dogs would chew you out
Tried to be so nice on those lonely nights
But I should have figured you out

[Chorus]
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine (It would have been fine, boy)
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time
(I would've had a good time now)
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine (I would've been, ooh baby)
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time

[Bridge]
Baby you're so fine
(You are the one that I love)
You are so fine
(Your love was sent from above)
You're so fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine
So doggone fine
Baby, you're so fine
(You are the one that I love)
You are so fine, oh, you're on my mind
You're fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine
Fine
(You are the one that I love)
Fine
(Your love was sent from above)
You're fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine
So doggone fine

[Chorus]
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine (I would've been fine)
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time
(I guess I would've had a good time)
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine (It would have been fine, boy)
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine (It's fine)
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time
(Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine)
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time...
