[Intro: MNDR, Q-Tip & Both]
Un, deux, trois, oh-oh!
Uh, turn it up a little bit more
Bang, bang, bang
Uh

[Verse 1: MNDR]
Feathers, I'm plucking feathers
One by one by one, no more skylarking
Around my head, your information
But there's no hiding behind moulting feathers

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
On the plane, on my brain, 'bout to do the show
40K contract? Take get out the door
Dice symbolise my life, roll 'em on the floor
From your grubby hands as you ham and grandstand
You live a shitty life, we live the bon bon vie
You hide it in the book while we watch the TV
Think you got us fooled? Who? Never again
First time, shame on me, second time, your time will end

[Chorus: MNDR]
No way, bang, you're dead, paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tête
Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Bang, you're dead, alouette, paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tête
Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)

[Post-Chorus: MNDR]
No way, no, the clock is ticking forward
No way, it's just a cruel, cruel world

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Cruel world is fittin', they got us all hidden
With late night divisions and lab rat incisions
But faced with decisions to fight or fricasse
And you clearly decided on how to handle me
Difficile, imbecile, is it fake? Is it real?
Are we dyin' on our feet? Are we tryin' in our sleep?
There's a rumor goin' 'round 'bout the suits runnin' town
If you look into the sky, dead birds fly high, high, high

[Verse 4: MNDR]
Numbers, you fly by numbers
You're logging hours and don't see the big picture
Over your shoulder, you'll get no last words
Because it's too late, you've clipped your own wings
(Your own wings)

[Chorus: MNDR]
No way, bang, you're dead, paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tête
Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Bang, you're dead, alouette, paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tête
Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)

[Bridge: Q-Tip & MNDR]
We're never gonna believe in the stories that you're weavin'
(Oh no, oh no, oh no)
We're never gonna believe in the stories that you're weavin'
(Oh no, oh no, oh no)
We're never gonna believe in the stories that you're weavin'
(Oh no, oh no, oh no)
We're believin' in the proof, we're believin' in the truth
We're believin' in each other, not you, you, you

[Verse 5: MNDR & Q-Tip]
Stories (You with the tall tales)
How many stories? (So many tall tales)
We climb the structure (We scale the ladder)
You build it higher (You make us madder)
We take our aim (So now we're bearin' arms)
You perch above your nest (Gotcha in your charms)
The stories in your head (Crazy bald-headed)
That's what got you dead

[Chorus: MNDR]
No way, bang, you're dead, paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tête
Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Bang, you're dead, alouette, paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tête
Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)

[Outro: MNDR]
Un, deux, trois
No one ever does it like that anymore
Bang, bang, bang
When feathers fly, you can deny everything (Alouette)
Un, deux, trois (Bang, bang)
No one ever does it like that anymore
Bang, bang, bang (Alouette)
When feathers fly, you can deny everything, yeah
(Oh no, oh no, oh no)
