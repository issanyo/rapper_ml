Yeah, I like this here
You gonna dance? Show me what you can do, boy
Now listen here, okay


[Q-Tip]
The girl I talked to she's sort of neurotic
Her crazy ex-boyfriend is really psychotic
Scares the girl by threatening her life
Says "Girl, you're dead if you're not my wife" (oh, man)
Beats in her public, beats her in private
Tried it 'round me, almost a riot
Said "Forget him, don't you know he's a loser
Who would love a woman turn around and abuse her?"
Only a fool as described by the Tribe
Here's another one who's on the fool vibe
Gonna make it short, gonna make it quick
For this situation makes me sick
See your brother man, with a female
His crazy ego tried to show he'll prevail
In any situation lady luck's on his side
Emotions run free, nothing he will hide
Why I remember one sunny day (yeah)
Took my cousin to the park, so we can play
On the way, a couple resembled
The one I just described, everything assembled
Another young man walked in their direction (yeah)
Bumped him a bit, excused his imperfection
But the man with the lady grabbed the other by the neck
Demanded an apology and also respect
The young man aggravated grabbed him back and smacked him
The girl just laughed and laughed and laughed at him
He felt ashamed for what he had done
And looked like a fool to everyone (Oh!)
These are three stories from the naked city (yeah)
Reality, is sometimes a ditty
Like Rod Serling from The Twilight Zone
Earth to your brain--is anyone home?
I see ya there, tryin' to make amends
Try to make some friends, but now my story ends
On the note, that I just wrote
Stay afloat on the reality boat
Slow down and think and take it cool
And try to avoid the description of a fool

Man, Tip, you think you all that now that you're on wax or somethin'
That you could tell a brotha what to do

If y'all could do it, mmm-hmm, yeah, ha, mmm, yeah...
Yeah, I like this here
You're gonna dance? Show me what you could do, boy

If y'all could do it, mmm-hmm, yeah, ha, mmm, yeah...
