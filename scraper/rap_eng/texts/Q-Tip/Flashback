Summer nights, laying back, hitting L's at the Velodrome
Contemplating why I've been so gone
Everybody changing for the better and the worse
I never thought my life would change when I left the Hurst
And now it's different, hearing pilots in the cockpit
Similar altitude, heavy greens in my pockets
Back in the day we played the drums until we dropped dead
As well as In the Bronx hearing bullets as they shot heads
Quarter flippin', while the moon was always in position
Far but close, what mattered most was always in traditions
Yo, I said my shit is poppin' like a kernel
Writing in my book of rhymes, shit is looking like a journal
Writing every night, I think my mind has gone nocturnal
Gone inside a bong, this year was always such a burn tho
Yo I'm so cold, I'm coughing up so many rhymes
Grab a jacket homie, I spit northeastern winter-time
All these lovely people wanna play me on rewind
Cause they know my steelo, I be spittin' the illest lines
Got so many bars, I be incarcerating committers of crimes
And last year I'd hang with monkeys, smoking the rarest vines
Walk back home, starving, always glad it was dinner time
Look in the mirror, I smelled tougher with the reddest eyes
Veins hotter than an arson, that's how you know we was getting high
That life is no more, but just a memory that passes by
But now a days, I be chilling sippin Gin and tonic
I've been so damn high, specialized in aeronautics
And you know the flow is so exotic
Catch me in a room, darker than Ye's fantasy
My rhymes got potential of causing global insanity
Always in the lab like a chemist, cooking like a chef
These people love the sound, max volume, I be leaving 'em deaf..

Let me bring it back
Homie, let me bring it back
Just let me bring it back
Fuck it, let me bring it back

Yo
This shit hit ya dome louder than your turntable
I used to smoke them L's but now I fucking burn fables
I've been painting pictures clearer than a Warhol
My circle's so small, don't even need a roll call
For so long I've been writing like I'm anonymous
I'm not even known, but I swear I'm in the books of Nostradamus's
Leaving 'em unconscious like they don't even know what time it is
So many coke heads, got the whole Arctic up they sinuses
Rappers, they look up to me like a planetarium
Never talk about how they use the heat but how they carry em
Like I said I'm on some rodeo shit
These motherfuckers listen to me on some Oh, Dios! shit

Let me bring it back
Homie let me bring it back
Please, let me bring it back
Fuck it, yo, Imma bring it back..

It's Capsoul

It's the moon..
It's the moon..
