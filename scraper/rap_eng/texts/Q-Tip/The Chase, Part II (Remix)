[Verse: Consequence]
Just relax y'all, just relax y'all...
I hit 'em with the boom, stick 'em, hahaha, hit 'em
It's the brother named 'Quence, not the victim but I still lick 'em
Still wax that shorty, now you know who got the props
Consequence, hazy flow, you know it just don't stop
'Cause if Monie was Born 2 Breed, I was born to smoke weed, indeed
A smooth player then I pop the seed in you
Yeah baby, I took you to the venue
And if my name was Coco, I still couldn't be into you
'Cause you got snuffed by the crooked tooth bandit
Who never got stranded
But kickin' the funky lyrics that the grands over-planned it, on earth
Has entered in my bottle, baby boy, now I'm gravy by birth
Ain't got a bag of blue funk, but a bag of green skunk
Want dogs? You want it? Muthafucka, knuckle up
'Cause I don't give a damn, my man, I won't deceive ya
Been through more growing pains than that nigga Michael Seaver
An over-achiever, you know you know my style
So peace to my niggas Danja Mo' and the Madchild
When I call a nigga out, he wants to wait  awhile like Janet
Niggas got jealous, they wanna ban it
But I still keep my voice, and when it's all said and done
Ayo, I still bring the noise
We wreck shop, so wait 'til the shit drop
Word is bond, yo, you know we don't stop
So niggas, press your luck, you get stuck like Chuck
We don't give a fuck, we don't give a damn
You know my name and you know who I am
The brother named 'Quence, all copped edition
You know they're 730, so don't fuck around
You will lay around, clown
Linden Boulevard, you know we got a zone
Queens got a zone
You know what? Yo, that nigga's fuckin' gone
