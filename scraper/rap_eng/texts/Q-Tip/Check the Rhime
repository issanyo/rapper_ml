[Verse 1: Benny Boy]
Back in the days on the boulevard of Vegas
We used to kick routines, and the presence was amazing
It was I the sidekick, and me the six-footer
I kicks a mad style sicker than a big booger
Ayo Ben you remember that routine
Where we started rhyming off with two things
Um um a tidbit, um a smidget
You got to start it off cause I don't seem to get it
You on point dude? Yo all the time man
You on point dude? Yo all the time man
You on point dude? Yo all the time man
Well I'm going, Go on then
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
And you don't like me, well then I don't really give a damn
Cause I care about my fans, not you middle men
I mean you little man, smaller than a kilogram
I hope my fan base'll be about a million
Cause your fan base is you and your ceiling fan
I'm iller than, and sicker than almost all of these
Sucka MCs that be trying to bother me
Trying to kill me aiming for my arteries
So ill everybody should be calling me that Sars disease
Even though that I oughta be green
But I stay the color of mahogany, awkwardly positive
Nope I don't need no test
You might be new, but you're not that fresh
Label me that if you want I guess
But I love them, A Tribe Called Quest
Not aiming to becoming one of the best
I'm just being different from all of the rest
Now I got that stress all off of my chest
And if you ain't understand a single word that I said
Then check the rhime dog
