[Verse 1: Norah Jones]
Life's filled with gray
But now, it comes clean
Leaves fall away
Hip-hop is playing again
And it's banging, too
Know it's bangin, for you
Don't stop this feeling I feel
I just wanna lay around all day
And feel the breeze upon my knees
I'm so into your rich history
Tell me stories and take me away
Come and take me, ooh
Come and take me with you

[Hook 4X: Norah Jones]
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Uh, uh, one step at a time, a man walked on the moon
