[Intro: Mariah Carey & Puff Daddy]
Oh, oh
Honey got me hooked on you
I like that, uh
I thought I told you
That we won't stop
Ooh, ooh (Come on)

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
All the money in the world couldn't even amount
To a teaspoon of honey that'll melt in your mouth (That's right)
It's The LOX and Mariah you know you check'n this out
You know they deal a few meals every time she come out
With her blown
And us flown
There ain't nuthin left for us to talk about
But a whole lot of doe

[Verse 2: Styles P]
And every current affiar
We there
Keepin' your hands in the air
Like we just don't care (Come On)
Don't be a lier
Would you change your attire (MC)
Get a bomb like Hillshire
Wit the honey like Mariah
Sceam to the ranch then ride a horse
Then come back to the city pushin' a Rolls Royce

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey]
Honey you can have me when you want me
You simply ask me to be there (a huh)
And you're the only one who makes me come running
Cause what you got is far beyond compare

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (That's right)
Oh, baby, I've got a dependancy
Always strung out for another taste of your honey (Uh huh)
When it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you
Crying for you
I adore you
Boy you know your love addected me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day
I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside (yeah, yeah)
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside

[Verse 4: Mariah Carey]
Oh, I can't be elusive with you honey (I like that)
Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
You're the only thing I wanna do

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
And it's just like honey when your love comes over me
Oh, baby, I've got a dependancy
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

[Verse 5: Mase]
You know Mase huff, we puff, we blow your house down
Bring that Harlem World sound directly to your town
In fact, this is why I act like that
I ain't dropped one single and I made this money back
I rock so swell, I gotta prevail
First rap superstar dominating pop sales
You never wish me well cause it start to sell
And it land me with pretty women in the Swiss hotel
And girls that mean a lot, I get em from the shop
Buy them everything they got from the jeans to the watch
You wanna be my misses
You gotta meet me wanna spoil you with my bitches
And you could tell that Mase is real 'cause he do real things
And I make things that's average look real mean
When it comes to sex I got the real thing
So when you cover your mouth they could hear you still scream

[Bridge: Mase & Mariah Carey]
Baby I can love you babe
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah you're on fire)
Gotta hold on love thy saints
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah take us higher)
Ooohh
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah you're on fire)
Ooohh
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah take us higher)

[Bridge: Puff Daddy & Mariah Carey]
(Breakdown)
Oooh, woah (Yeah)
Every little thing you do
(Now what we gonna do right here, we gonna smooth it out, come on)
Ooh, woah, honey, got me hooked on you
(MC, and she won't stop)
Honey, it's like

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you
Crying for you
I adore you
Boy you know your love addected me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day
I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
