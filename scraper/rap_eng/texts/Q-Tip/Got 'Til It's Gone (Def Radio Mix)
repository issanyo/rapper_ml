[Intro: Janet]
Got til it’s gone
Got til it’s gone
Got til it’s gone
Got til it’s gone
Got til it’s gone
Got til it’s gone

[Verse 1: Janet]
Have a feeling, now believing that you
Were the one I was meant to be with
Oh how I'm wishing, thinking, dreaming
‘Bout you, and the love
How'd I ever let you get away?

[Chorus: Joni Mitchell sample]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Post-Chorus: Janet + (Q-Tip)]
Gone
(What? Joni Mitchell never lies)

[Verse 2: Janet]
If I could turn back the hands of time
Make you, fall in love, in love with me again
So would you give me another chance to love
To love you, love you the right way, no games

[Chorus: Joni Mitchell sample]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
(Joni Mitchell never lies)
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Post-Chorus: Janet]
Got til it’s gone
Got til it’s gone

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
I heard he swims with this chick on the beach
Cold jonesin’
Ringing my house, hanging up and imposing
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that?

[Interlude: Janet + (Q-Tip) + Joni Mitchell sample]
Got til it’s gone (Yeah yeah)
Got til it’s gone (Never ever realize)
Got til it’s gone (Never ever realize)
Got til it’s gone (Uh, Joni Mitchell never lies)
Got til it’s gone
Got til it’s gone
(Don’t know what you got til it’s gone)
Got til it’s gone (Joni Mitchell never lies)
(Don’t know what you got til it’s gone)
Got til it’s gone
(Don’t know what you got til it’s gone)
Got til it’s gone
(Don’t know what you got til it’s gone)
Got til it’s gone
(Don’t know what you got til it’s gone)
Got til it’s gone (Joni Mitchell never lies)
(Don’t know what you got til it’s gone)
Got til it’s gone
(Don’t know what you got til it’s gone)
Got til it’s gone
(Don’t know what you got til it’s gone)
(Joni Mitchell never lies)
