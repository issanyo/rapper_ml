[Verse 1]
When I woke up in the morning, I still felt it in my bones
Because I think about that morning, when I called you at your home
I told you about my rough times, and you rushed me off the phone
Was it because you didn’t really care, or because you weren’t alone?

[Chorus]
Lisa left me with just a half-smile
Only half of her heart the whole while
Lisa listened but she ain’t hear me
This is going too far, be near me

[Verse 2]
Does he really care about you? And that’s the questions that I ask
Makes you wanna be a better you, and makes the good times last
Can you see him inside of you, I mean, you feel him when he’s gone?
I’m feeling we’re a lost cause, and I’m hoping that I’m wrong, but…

[Chorus]
Lisa left me with just a half-smile
Only half of her heart the whole while
Lisa listened but she ain’t hear me
This is going too far, be near me

[Bridge]
Lisa, only tried to show you my heart
Lisa, only tried to show you I care
Lisa, only tried to show you my heart
Lisa, only tried to show you I care
Lisa, only tried to show you my heart
Lisa, only tried to show you I care
Lisa, only tried to show you my heart
Lisa…oh…

[Chorus]
…left me with just a half-smile
Only half of her heart the whole while
She would listen but she ain’t hear me
This is going too far, be near me

Be near me (Repeat until end)
