[Instrumental]

So…I’m wondering…where do you go when you’re gone
I’m wondering…will you be gone for long?
I’m wondering…will I have to come along?
I’m wondering…where did you go?
And why? And when? And what? And who? And why?
Where do you go, huh?
Where do you go? Where did you go?
Where? And what? And why? And who? And why? And where?
And why? And where? And why? And where? And why? And where?
And why? Why?

(“You’re in a better place” in background)
I guess you’re in a better place
I guess you’re in a better place
Yeah, I guess you’re in a better place
I know you’re in a better place
I guess you’re in a better place
I guess you’re a better place
