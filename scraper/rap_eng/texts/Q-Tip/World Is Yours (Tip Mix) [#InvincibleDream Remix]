Who's world is this
Yeah yeah yeah ya dig

Shots of Tennessee whiskey, intoxicate my liver
And influence the ways that I operate on the rhythm
Precision, like I'm a surgeon holding a scalpel
My verses are the sermons you've heard in churches & chapels
The whole game changed, they're rocking skirts and satchels
I'm from an era where all my idols deserve statues
From Puba to the boosters on St Johns and Utica
To drug dealers dealers with truck jewelry that all influenced us (it's real talk)
Piss poor, looking up to Rich Porter
Money, hoes, clothes, we learned it in this order
'Lo knits & Gucci kicks make the cipher complete
I see these hype beasts that never lived a life on the streets
I keep falling, but never to the vices I keep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
Lick a shot for Barack's presidency
(take money)
Never thought I'd see a black president since Eric B nigga

Who's world is this?
The world is yours to the lil homie saving for a pair of new J's
Who's world is this?
The world is yours to my fam coming home just a few more days
Who's world is this?
The world is yours to the single moms working to provide for her kids
Who's world is this?
Ayo the world is mine, it's the invincible dream and you know what it is

To my mother & Dwayne, God bless your life
To my people in Flatbush, God bless your life
My insight ignites vision
Despite the trife living
Seen the streets raise Boyz II Men like Mike Bivens
My sister went to E Hall when I was yay small
So I would overhear stories how the thieves came off
Robbing name plate chains, sheepskins, & 8 balls
If you tried play hard they was letting the flame off
Broad day while the kids would play ball
Used to frequent Kenmore before the theater got shot up
Rastas on Martense always had product
Top shottas play Shabba or maybe the Don Dada
'Round the time you do the boggle to Chaka Demus & Pliers
Drug dealers was flyest, gold draped their attire
Flatbush was real & these flashbacks are ill
Cause my memories are vivid like they were captured on film

The world is mine, trying to take over the hood like Ni√±o Brown
Who's world is this?
The whole world is mine cause the hood's gone soft with no heroes around
Who's world is this?
Ayo the world is yours
It's the invincible dream ya dig
It's the invincible dream ya dig

I graduated from the block. This is my street thesis
The school of hard knocks and days of Elleses
I'm a product of the p's, I know about free cheeses
Appreciative for the grief, it made us the street dreamers
That became NBA athletes & league leaders
Rap stars, they look in disbelief at what we did
Cause we came from the streets to arenas
But this is Martin's dream & the speech that preceded
And I'm amped up like Ye
When he said Sway don't got answers
There's a disadvantage cause the hood is thinking backwards
Niggas get more love in the state pen in handcuffs
Than graduates from Penn State coming home from campus
They tried to tell me that Sharpton was a snitch
Read the headline and said, what malarkey is this
Know the Feds are probably listening, targeting the kid
So until I meet sleep's cousin, I'm talking my shit

Who's world is this?
