[Spoken: Janet]
What's, what's the next song?

[Spoken: Q-Tip]
The one about me

[Spoken: Janet]
Oh yea, I like this...
Like Joni says

[Refrain: Joni Mitchell]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Verse 1: Janet]
Have a feeling, now believing that you
Were the one I was meant to be with
Oh how I'm wishing, thinking, dreaming
Bout you, and the love
How'd I ever let you get away

[Manipulated Joni Mitchell Sample]
Don't it always seem
Don't it always seem
Don't it always seem
Don't it always seem

[Refrain: Joni Mitchell]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Q-Tip: Joni Mitchell never lies
That you don't know what you've got til it's

[Verse 2: Janet]
If I could turn back the hands of time
Make you, fall in love, in love with me again
So would you give me another chance to love
To love you, love you the right way, no games

[Refrain: Joni Mitchell]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
One two, one two, yo
Let me just fuck with it for a minute, what
Now you realizing when them nights go long, right
Campaign for me to stay when you know that I'm gone, right
You act all wild, when I tell you to settle
I was working round the clock, but your girls want to meddle
Talk about I heard he swims with this chick on the beach
That was out with the tide but my love you impeach
Now you looking at the walls, head in hands, cold jonezin
Ringing my house, hanging up and imposing
Now why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
Now why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
Now why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
Now why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that

[Refrain: Joni Mitchell]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til it's
Q-Tip: Joni Mitchell never lies
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Spoken: Q-Tip]
Yo, do you feel that?

[Manipulated Joni Mitchell Sample]
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Spoken: Q-Tip]
Dust
