[Intro]
It’s for this girl
And she was like—she knew who I was or whatever, right
And she was like, “Yo, I love what you did and everything you’ve done
I really miss your voice
All this music I hear, I dig it, I dig it, and I dance to it
But I want something for me
Like, you know, just for me, you know
I don’t look at myself as this way or that way
And I just want you to do a record for me
And, you know, those who feel like me and think like me”
And this was a true story, I was, like, touched by that
I know this kinda un-hip-hop of me to be touched by something
I did this little joint right here, check it out one time
Listen

[Verse 1]
Here’s a slow style and it’s never your style
MC’s rap isn’t really that mack
Your wishes get a grant from the brother on a slant
On the curb, the audacity of rappers, some nerve
Fishing in the ponds of piranha in this game
Could prove to be fatal if priorities are lame
By that I mean, you know, focused in on material
Although it has its place, it should really be residual
Making it a point to do it right for you
You an upright lady with sass and a brew
Never will I pass on a little bit of sass
I’m obliging this request on an Abstract set
All the single moms with your children in your arms
Who do it every day on a hard-earned pay
Resenting the word “ho” that dudes overuse
I’m sorry for that, mama, some cats are just rude
All the elder women who have raised a few divisions
Hats go off to the lives brought forth
All the pretty ladies who got to hustle
Who want to enjoy rap but find there’s a struggle
Feels objectified so much they get dizzy
There’s a million and one ways to say “Get busy”
And to the little angels, little women out there
Who’s home alone too and at your TV you stare
You’re way more precious than the things on the screen
Keep your head to the sky and just dream
Keep your head to the sky and just dream

[Chorus]
I don’t even know if you’ll take requests
But can’t you say something for me?
I don’t even know if you’ll take requests
But can’t you say something for me?
I don’t even know if you’ll take requests
But can’t you say something for me?
I don’t even know if you’ll take requests
But can’t you say something for me?
I don’t even know if you’ll take requests
But can’t you say something for me?
I don’t even know if you’ll take requests
But can’t you say something for me?
I don’t even know if you’ll take requests
But can’t you say something for me?
I don’t even know if you’ll take requests
But can’t you say something for me?

[Outro (Vocal Samples)]
MC’s rap isn’t really that mack
Audacity of rappers, some nerve
Hats go off to the lives brought forth
Pretty ladies…feel objectified
There’s a million and one ways to say “Get busy”
Way more precious than the things on the screen
Keep your head to the sky and just dream
Keep your head to the sky and just dream

I don’t even know if you’ll take requests
But you can’t you say something for me?
I don’t even know if you’ll take requests
But you can’t you say something for me?
