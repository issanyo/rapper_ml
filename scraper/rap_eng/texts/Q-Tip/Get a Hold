[Intro]
Drifting back... suddenly
Drifting back (just) suddenly
Drifting back (just) suddenly

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
The deadly venom, let me start from the beginning
We always hitting, so yo, there'll be no extra innings
As I send the mic out the park like Reggie Jackson
You be the minor leaguer who sees no action
The coming attraction, what, the main feature
And I'mma greet ya, like a rhyming ass creature
Lurking all up in the dark, unknown parts
The brother well prepared is the brother who will start
And that's me Akh
I, as long as the ladies move they bodies
We'll have a forum to stand
Cause that happens to be the nature of man
Sexuality, it is the format baby
Ain't no ifs, no buts, no ands, or maybes
But I praise the Lord of the worlds that's unseen
Respect me for that and let me do my thing
I said, respect me for that and let me do my thing

[Chorus]
You know we gotta get a hold
Over the illest drum rolls

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Yo, how you doing? Let me give you an intro
My name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info
Got the diamond in the back and the sunroof shit
That makes the hardcore MC's resort to being bitch
And I don't give a shit about being wild rich
Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it
Your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
Down to his zealots, upchuck and then spit
Denouncing my beliefs, well then your wig get split
Lay your egos on the ground so that you'll benefit
You can take these words and relay it to your clique
Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
Don't try to play me, see my name's not Dick
The Tribe is the crew that makes the mics get lit
Like the Fourth of July on some firework shit
My record company be on some true jerk shit
But that's aight, now, I'm on some true work shit
And I'mma make it happen for my whole outfit

[Chorus]
You know we got to get control
Over the illest drum rolls

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
A-yo, we just getting started, got to redirect this vision
Got the beauty of a flower plus dimensions like a prism
Your minds are locked down like prison
Y'all really need to go lay down cause positivity has risen
We hitting, yo bust how we too strong to be broken
Occasional malfunction pressure time, we ain't joking
For security, yo we on this run like Logan
Kamaal's doing the hustle and you backstage vogueing
We all got faults, don't ever try to think that you perfect
We all are human beings, there's bullshit at the surface
Sometimes, I mean we rhyme, damn, we ain't prophets
And if you think so, you need to stop it
So jump back inside your shell
Let your million dollar thoughts propel but next man don't get jel
Playa hate that all carries weight that we don't need
We slim with disabilities and thick with possibilities
Cause then you can't move with agility
Navigating with good visibility
We put these tunes out in record shop facilities
And strive to get this constant money activity
We try to stay on the scene like Fidel
So if you get enraged with these names it still ring bells
There ain't no plan B's, yo watch, we moving through with plan A
Money market doing things the right way

[Chorus]
You know we gotta get a hold
Over the illest drum rolls

[Outro: Q-Tip]
Yo bust it out section, section
Section Linden Boulevard
Section on Merrick
Section the whole Jamaica
Section on Flushing
Section in Bed-Stiduy
