Fabolous, Funk Flex Vol. 4 niggas see'mon
It's gettin' hard to dodge the women
But I'm still pitching hard white balls
Faster than Roger Clemens
Ya know the kid with the O's
That's as large as linens
When it comes to sellin' trees
I'm as large as Timberland
My lawyer got my charges slimmin'
He said the only way I am goin upstate
If it's in larger swimmin'
Pull out the garage like gremlins
Anarge with trimmins
System in it that have the projects tremblin'
Ya know nothin' about lettin' a few strays go off
Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes
Nigga I walk around with the grams you stackin'
And me and Flex don't roll unless they Andrew Jackson
It's Brooklyn by me the crook the I-B ya even look
At ID you gettin' hooked to I-V
Motherfuckers huh
