[Intro]
We've been lovers on a mission
We've been lovers on a mission (All the way)
But what's love without a mission?
We've been lovers on a mission (All the way)
So let's take an intermission

[Chorus]
You know I have the world to think
And I know I gotta go ahead and take some time
Because the last thing that I want
Is thinking that it's time that I leave the borderline

[Verse 1]
So let's take it off tonight
Break it off tonight
Baby, let's know when to let go
Know when to let go
Take it off tonight
Break it off tonight
Baby, you know you're tired
Know I'm tired
Let's take it off tonight
Break it off tonight
Baby, it's war outside these walls
Baby, it's war outside these doors, yeah
A safe place tonight
Let's play it safe tonight
Baby, you know what you're fighting for
Baby, you know what I'm fighting for

[Chorus]
You know I have the world to think
And you know I gotta go ahead and take some time
Because the last thing I want
Is think that it's time that I leave the borderline

[Verse 2]
So let's take it off tonight
Break it off tonight
Baby, let's know when to let go
Know when to let go, oh
Take it off tonight
Break it off tonight
Baby, you know you're tired
Know I'm tired
Let's take it off tonight
Break it off tonight
Baby, I've been more than a woman

[Outro]
We've been lovers on a mission
A safe place tonight
Let's play it safe tonight
Baby, we've, we've been lovers on a mission (All the way)
So let's take an intermission
