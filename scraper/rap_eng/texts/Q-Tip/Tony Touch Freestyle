[Verse 1: Black Thought]
To the best of my knowledge I guess that I'm fresh
When I manifest
Hold up dog
Yo Tone it's the John
It's the professional
I make your girl get extra low
I'm from south with a border like Mexico
Jaws talking bout they love me like x and o
Cause their man pop early like Plaxico
Not conceptual, unexceptional, hundred dollar bills filled of cocaine residue
Got you off your deed I'm ten steps ahead of you
Fresher than a 1985 fresh festival, live
One time for my hoods and my barrios
Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, Trinitarios
In the hood staying dipped like Oreos
Even with a Moms on their shit like Marios
From the Illadelph valley side of things
And embalmed in my words in the Valley of the Kings
When I finish y'all, I ring alarms like Tenor Saw
And rage war with a Renascence, ya'll better get it far
Rest in Peace, J. Dilla
The Legendary Roots Crew from the city of Philla
Yup, mines the math
Though I rocks the mic and never got to past
But I got your ass
Listen, uh
Well, I'm a legend in my own time
Look at y'all, just a legend in your own mind
I let the drum talk to me cause it don't lie
A lot of rappers try to kill it but they don't die
Keep them coming back and feel it like a throatpie
La vida loca, from something toke to this
Grand Imperial, hall of fame material
Black, general 215, name rank and cereal
My thing highly flammable
I bang like a hammer do
Swine flu, bird flu, and every type of animal
I'm immune to Tamiflu
I'll be God Damn if you
Insane and bananas too
My bling is intangible
Well it's the Jet Li
I'm working on your requiem
Step in a party everybody scream, "That's him!"
I push a fast BM
Black gray Gatsby and
My gats be in the
Belfry that the bats be in
A box is what you never gonna catch me in
If this the last day and times nigga
Cash in
Yep
Looks like a job for a conquerer
Top mr third Mr swerve mr popular
You kinda finished
Can't see it with binoculars
Rather have a fish bone lodged in your esophogus
You ever heard of the world?
I'm on top of this
Still the most properest
Y'all know what the gospel is
Bless the child
I ain't wind up a x-file
After {???} self imposed exile
I reimerged cut from a different textile
They say i'm just wild
Waiting on my next trial
I've always been the nigga with the most fresh style
In '98 I rocked what you copped just now
I had dreams like Akira Kurosawa
And realized my meteoric rise to power
They say I drive 220 miles per hour
Sixteen bars: 220 thousand dollars
[???]About it
Reliant hypnotic
The game full of too many funny clowns and cowards
Look
Son of a'slam aleikum
I'm an abomination
A marijuana patient
With Grammy nominations
If everything and everybody in their proper places
Black Thought is out his mind he on that outer space shit
Spotted on the red carpet steppin' out a space ship
With a glass of shiraz and two around the way chicks
Nowadays don't nobody say shit
You don't want to see me get up on my modern day shit
Try to tell you Thought's dangerous
Can't nobody hang with this Great
Translated into 80 different languages
Websters and Cambridges
Every day the chamber switch
Grown-ass man
I don't know who the fuck you playing with
I Leave with heads in my
Take-away-from-dinner bag
Wicked grin like Mahmoud Ahmedinijad
Never been a nice nigga cuz they finish last
I'm a menace
That's what i'ma be remembered as
Fresh
