[Intro:]
I’m just tryna survive in the big city… I’m just tryna survive [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Ghetto style the subject is making dollars
But taxes is how you packing is making me
Want to holler.. who starving like Marvin
Who’s carving the apple pie we eating
Somebody is clearly eating the  benefits we ain’t receiving
Let me us the people tryna be fly like the eagle
That’s printed on all our paper
So we plotting and holy paper oh no
We want to inspire but nobodys get higher then we have to be providers
So we got to be survivors
You’ve got to keep your head on strong
And if you fall down you know you can’t stay down for long
You got to earn respect and stand firm in your place
She know you got what you got when we count on you can’t disgrace

[Chorus 2:]
I’m just tryna to survive in the big city
Your just tryna survive
I’m just tryna to survive in the big city
Your just tryna survive… you know I am too

[Verse 2:]
Don’t trip off the way life is hard
And you got to stay up and always show sincere heart
And don’t let no one take your dreams away from you
You got to let these fools know that you staying true

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge:]
Throw your hands up in the air if you’re just trying to survive
Throw you hands up in the air if you got some money in your pocket
I’m just tryna survive
Survive...survive..survive

[Chorus 2]
I’m just tryna to survive in the big city
Your just tryna survive
I’m just tryna to survive in the big city
Your just tryna survive…
Keep your head up and keep on moving
Keep on grinding and know what you’re doing (repeat)
I’m just tryna survive… ooohh

[Outro:]
I’m just tryna to survive in the big city
Your just tryna survive
Keep on going don’t give up y’all
Keep on grinding stand up tall
Survive.survive.survive.. survive
