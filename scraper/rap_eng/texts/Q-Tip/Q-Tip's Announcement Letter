TO ALL THE GOOD PEOPLE WORLDWIDE!

We hope this letter finds you & yours safe and without a scratch!

Last year this time myself, Jarobi, Ali and PHIFE had the extreme pleasure of performing on the Tonight Show©. It was our 1st T.V. performance in 18 yrs

The energy for us that night was one that we hadn't experienced on stage together in some time!

It was also the night of the
PARIS BOMBING....
November 13th...Friday...
A unseasonably warm night in NYC...

As we left 30 ROCK I felt the need, we all did, to get back to the Studio and start that Cookup!!
SO WE GOT TO IT

It was coming together nicely and as you may know we lost our BROTHER may GOD REST HIS SOUL on March 22nd

But he left us with the BluePrint of what we had to do

So collected ourselves and along tribesman, BUSTA and CONS...we completed what will be, obviously the final
A TRIBE CALLED QUEST ALBUM!

No this isn't filled with old Phife Bars.. This is that Pure, unstepped on Pure!!
And on November 11th, 2016
We will complete our Paths of Rhythm.. Join Us!!

PEACE!! Q-Tip
