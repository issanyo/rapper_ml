Yeah this the dark skin
Marksmen
Shot that
Yeah when I drop that
I bet they go & cop that
These niggas trash rap I could
Never rock that
I'm just myself man
& y'all could never stop that


I just be spitting my writtens
They be about how I'm feeling
& what I'm hoping & wishing for
It's true

I'm a young man on mission
Just tryna split up these dividends
W/ my family & kin
The Whole damn crew

Just know that script flip reciprocal
I ain't reaching no pinnacle
& we need them residuals
Ain't no damn fool

And this feeling real mystical
Like I had hand full of spliffs
Drained in one hit
Taking shots no brick

I'm the only one rapping on this track no assists
The chosen one chasing hella stacks
For the kids
Mental leaking upon boom bap
W/ the kicks
Like oh man I really was made for this shit




Pressed for the cash im a button on the ATM
But I make the ends meet
Ain't no separating them
Regulate the heat like a mfin atrium

Yeah you go double to get through me
Triple if you count the writing

Yeah I be clashing w/ some gods but I'm not a titan

Score could be 0-9 bet I go out fighting

It could be hair or the style bet them niggas biting

Oh they be trifling
Fire fighting w/ dragons that's equip w/ tridents
Bet you get burned

Stab my back & slash Achilles
& I'm still standing stern

You'll get scorched alive in here
We put yo ash in a urn

No you know nothing bout this here
It is not of your concern




Last but not least
First & foremost R.I.P
To Prodigy

The 2nd half of Mobb Deep
May your Legacy be remembered

And never dismembered
When I pop the top & I drop this
Im yelling timber

This some heavy shit
Nigga yeah my word hold weight

Every letter a thousand pounds
Before the action take place

The way I spit so much crack you'd swear the trap was my face

She say she love the way I look you'd swear the trap was my face

No need to deface the property
Hot anomaly what i is & what I gotta be

Nothing's stopping me
Stack my blessings
I'm never toppling

This the exam
& y'all just proctoring

Stitch the game up patch it
I'm doctoring

I'm really scoomin' & boomin
I think I might flex

I'll steal the show knock ya socks off
Just need a mic check

Yeah all this shit that I've been doing
Just a light threat

I bet you take a step back & think
Did he right that

Of course I did fool
Ya been knew

Ya see my vision
Right through ya retinals

I've been cool
& beneficial


& been official
I still move

You better take a step back (check it out)
& see what you can do ya damn fool
