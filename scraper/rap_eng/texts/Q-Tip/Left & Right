[Verse 1: Redman]
My flow's remarkable
Doc walk like Caine from Kung Fu 'round the globe
Throw obstacles I'll hurdle them
Herb and whack MC's
Drum racks to the rims, to the caps
Yo Methical, and D, I'm ASAP
I'm crack of dawn chicken hunting at KFC
In '83 I was that scrub TLC talked about
Now I rock the house, chalk 'em out

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Yeah, no doubt
Who got the biggest ass in the house?
Young miss, fillet-of-fish, salt water trout
Pretty young thing, got a tongue ring and dirty mouth
And she whispering them sweet nothings, I air it out
Baby you got me like Joanie had Chachi
Until she got high and went and fucked Potsie
Lady Godiva, from day one a dick rider
Liar, liar set your pussy on fire

[Verse 3: D'Angelo]
I see you dancing right now
I don't need to tell you that you know how
Baby you do (oh)
I say you belong
And if you dream to be free
I can take you there, just follow me
Baby I won't
Steer you wrong

[Bridge]
And it seems like to me
You want someone to fit your pedigree
Baby I do
So what you want?
Smack your ass, pull your hair
And I'll even kiss you way down there
You know that I will
Think I won't?

[Chorus: D'Angelo + (Method Man)]
Specially when you do it
Left and right
(Keep it moving)
Up and down
(Love when we do it)
Left and right
(keep movin')
Up and down
Left and right and up and down
(Yo, D, how we do it?)
Left and right and up and down
(Yo, D, how we do it?)
Left and right and up and down
(Yo, D, how we do it?)
Left and right and up and down
(Yo, D, how we do it?)
Left, left, left, left

[Verse 4: D'Angelo]
Here you are in my world
Make you feel like a pearl
Rub your back and fulfill your needs
So why don't we just get undressed
Feel the tender touch of your caress
That's what I want
Why don't you give it to me

[Bridge]
I will have you believe
There's no reason for you to leave
Stay right here in my arms
Where you're safe and secure
Here with me you can be sure
There's no threat, say you turn me on

[Chorus: D'Angelo + (Method Man)]
Specially when you do it
Left and right
(Keep it moving)
Up and down
(Love when we do it)
Left and right
(keep movin')
Up and down
Left and right and up and down
(Yo, D, how we do it?)
Left and right and up and down
(Yo, D, how we do it?)
Left and right and up and down
(Yo, D, how we do it?)
Left and right and up and down
(Yo, D, how we do it?)
Left, left, left, left

[Bridge: D'Angelo]
I know that you know the sexy little things you do
I know that you know the sexy little things you do

[Verse 5: Redman + (Method Man)]
Yo Doc be off the wall
With Keith and Mally G
Pulling a Harley D with a jar of green
Come 1-5-1, straight indo, the spot
I fuck brown sugar behind the fiber glass window
It's Doc not guns don't sling weight
The only thing I sling is condoms for spring break
(Fuck 'em) How we do it?
(Leave 'em) How we do it?
(Get the money) The pussy
(The weed) Now do it!

[Verse 6: Method Man]
Now take your coat off and stay a while
Now honey child if you're gon' be acting funny style
Then I don't need ya
It's Saturday, this night fever
Shit is popping, Cheeba, my mouth cotton
'Tis the season for draws dropping
And heavy breathing
You ain't skeezing
You dick teasing?
I'm leavin'
Acting rotten, I got no time for games
I'm no joke
Drop that ass when I'm finished
And watch it smoke
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
