Uh, check it out now

Uh, no doubt now

Uh, yo, check it out now

Uh, no doubt, yo

Special girl, real good girl

Biggest thing in my itty bitty world

Called her up and she made me feel right

Wish bliss could never take flight

Sittin back with this mic in my hand

Spittin hot shit tryin to see grand

Imprinted on my mind every minute

Make my plans and you always in it, yo

(Chorus)
It's such a vivrant thing

Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing

And even though we both fly

Give each other space and not the evil eye

Actin like grownups

Don't even try to hide cause the spot blown up

Girlfriend tellin you she wanna see

I say 'I dunno' but you say 'Gladly'

And when we both do hemp

We go on and on and on and on and on and

Sweeter than Ben & Jerry

Can I rhyme?

Well you know I gets mine

Sittin round in my abstract part

This abstract thing doin abstract parts, yo

(Chorus) x4
Gettin back to my MC status

All the willy that I kick make the other niggas mad as

Movin, to your town and situation

Shorty thought she subtle but she really was blatant when she

Shook her thing and violated

Now these wolf-like thoughts are formulated

I'm sayin, 'Yo is this some heart felt shit in here'

Am I a strongman nigga well shit yea

Plus we can hold a convo

Or go to the movies, my crib, whatever yo

Just wanna see you by my side

We on 95, know the stash is in the ride

A rappin nigga for real

You would find me in a cypher if I didn't cop a deal

Rap slate like big grate

You buy, I sell, we split big cake

Uh uh, just move your little thing

Move it around and shake your little thing

Uh Uh

(Chorus) x3
