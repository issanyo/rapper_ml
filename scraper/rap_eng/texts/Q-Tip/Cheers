[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
They ask me where I'm going from here
Shit, anywhere long as the runway is clear
Shit, music business movin' too fast for me (God damn)
Wishin' I still had Mac wit' me (Yes Lord!)
How do you tell a nigga slow it down when you livin' just as fast as 'em?
I couldn't understand when I seen 'em stretched out cold on the pavement
Niggas catch T-K-O's on occasion
Wishin' I could save 'em, what was I to say?
I was doin' dates, dippin' in and out of state
We was goin' in to get away
Sick of feelin' so outta place
Wishin' I could save ya, what was I to say?
Wishin' I could save ya, but now it's too late
Now, is this really what I wanted?
Is it really worth the pain?
Now am I really an asshole? Fuck what you say
Don't do me no favors, let's get back to basics
We live for today, bitch, fuck up out my way, bitch
I'm losin' all my aces, I'm runnin' outta patience
Got some pretty faces knowin' what my name is
Up in high places, I got some new neighbors
They don't really say shit but when they see the spaceship
They just think I rap or some form of entertainment
But they don't know I'm black, young, gifted and amazin'

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You know I had to close my eyes, yeah
And if I have to free my mind
I may not have the lane, movin' all along
Knowin' that I can't do it on my own
And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out
Have to run away, think I'm goin' home

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, you know I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
I know you somewhere in the atmosphere
I know someday I'll meet you halfway there (Cheers)
They say there's nothin' you can do about it
Can't say that I'm new to sorrow
Wishin' I could take your problems
Trade 'em for a little more time wit'chu
Carry you out the bottom, the weight of the world, I got it
Sprouted wit'chu on my shoulder, the greatest honor to know ya
I'd gotta be honest wit'cha, I hate you ain't in the picture
I hate all them fake niggas claimin' like they gon' really miss ya
I know there's no one to blame and maybe the point that I'm missin'
But I needed a minute, just give me a minute

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You know I had to close my eyes, yeah
And if I have to free my mind
I may not have the lane, movin' all along
Knowin' that I can't do it on my own
And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out
Have to run away, think I'm goin' home

[Break: Anderson .Paak]
Oh, say it ain't so!
Tears keep fallin' down my eyes
Damn it, I miss you, I should be with you
Can't turn back the hands of time but I should be with you
I miss my friend
Damn it, I miss you
Cannot bring you back

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
These pictures I'm seein' are fuckin' me up
And I don't know what to do but reminisce and face the pain
Back in the day before you were a dog and you were just pup
Bangin' beats and bringin' bitches back to the tour bus
Excuse me, y'all, I know this .Paak shit, I just need a second
It's Q-Tip in this bitch and I'm just in here reflectin'
Head on collisions with memories in the intersection
Lookin' in my rearview, wishin' I could be near you
The freeways of my mind are crowded with traffic
The good times that we had and them bad habits
Look at me now, look around, last man standin'
Grown man cryin' like a child tryna understand it
So sick of sendin' flowers to all of my brother's mommas
Don't know what's harder, fightin' trauma or keepin' a promise
A true confession breath is a blessin', without a question
But niggas don't get the message until they get disconnected
My story ain't over, I'm still turnin' pages
But the picture I painted with you in it has faded
My queen, my dreams and even my wages
I know what it means to lose everything when you made it
Rags to the riches and back to the rags is a muh'fucka
The consequence of puttin' all your chips in one bucket
To be honest, I feel like gettin' right back to these commas
You mother fuckers keep the drama

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
I know there must be somethin' after here
I know some day I'll meet ya halfway there in the atmosphere
Cheers

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Free my mind
You know I had to close my eyes
Close my eyes
You know I have to free my mind
Oooooh
You know I had to close my eyes
You know it's time for me...
You know I have to free my mind

[Outro]
Free my...
Free
Free
Free my...
...My mind
My mind
My Mind
