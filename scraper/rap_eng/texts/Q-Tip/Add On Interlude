[Q-Tip & Busta Rhymes]
I'm not gonna be one of them niggas
That just wrap up in my blanket
And be like "I did this, i did this"
(Busta Rhymes laughs)
That's why im still here fucking around (Word up)
You know what im sayin?
Because it's like we love it (Real Talk)
You know what we gonna do, like this is what it is, you know what i'm sayin?
(No question no question)
You know, whats done is done, the history
I'm thankful and grateful for it but it's done now, you know what i'm sayin?
I'm still here, the creator's still got me and got him
So now we just gotta, in this moment look forward (and add on) and hopefully add on (add on)
