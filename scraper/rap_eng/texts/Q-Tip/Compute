[Verse 1]
Please look…my way
I’m not profane…please look my way
I’ve got…a lot to give
A lot to give to you…please look my way
They cannot compare, they don’t do it over here
Whisper and I’m gone, but something seems wrong

[Chorus]
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me

[Verse 2]
I wanna go to the show just like the next man
But shit ain’t sane
I wanna take to that girl with the big ol’ thang
But thangs ain’t sane
I wanna walk outside with no direction
But shit ain’t sane
I wanna live this life, this life like a baller
But shit ain’t sane
I wanna drink swamp water and talk to your daughter
But she ain’t right
I wanna go to Pico El Pollo Loco
But that ain’t right
I wanna be Ben Franklin, put it in the sky
And fly my kite
I wanna change this place with all of the thoughts
That I conceive
I wanna talk to my man and say, “How you doin’?”
But he may leave
I wanna do the things and not wipe my eyes
From disbelief
I wanna kiss that girl and talk to that one
And get that one and talk to this one
And have a big family under the sun
But that’s insane

[Chorus]
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me

[Guitar solo]

Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me

Come on (Come on), let’s work (let’s work)
Who dat? (Who dat?), Oh, that’s Kurt (That’s Kurt)
Come on (Come on), let’s work (let’s work)
Who dat? (Who dat?), Oh, that’s Kurt (That’s Kurt)

[Kurt Rosenwinkel guitar solo]

Come on (Come on), get down (get down)
Come on (Come on), get down (get down)
Come on (Come on), get down (get down)
Come on (Come on), get down (get down)

[Guitar solo]

Come on (Come on), let’s work (let’s work)
Come on (Come on), oh, that’s Kurt (That’s Kurt)
Come on (Come on), let’s work (let’s work)
Come on (Come on), oh, that’s Kurt (That’s Kurt)

[Verse 3]
Why everybody won’t be fuckin’ with me
Just because I’m different with my poetry?
And I really don’t be tryin’, it just go that way
Fuck being popular, far from a stupid star
More like dust from a one def L
The Earth gravity, it tried to siphon me to hell
People pass judgement and they say what they wanna say
All of that there make they rigor mortis anyway
I’ma seek life, go about it on my everyday
Matador man, bull is out, people scream “Olé!”
More three-dimension, far from convention
If you want the next shit, then you at the next session
Wanna play it safe in these fragile times of war?
Join the population—what the fuck you waitin’ for?
Rich man focus on the poor man booty
And a poor child focused on a TV cutie

It ain’t me...it’s ain’t me…it ain’t me…it ain’t me

[Chorus]
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me
Something that don’t compute, it ain’t me

Something…something that…something…something that
Something…something that…

[Guitar solo]

It ain’t me…it ain’t me…it ain’t me…it ain’t me
It ain’t me…it ain’t me…
