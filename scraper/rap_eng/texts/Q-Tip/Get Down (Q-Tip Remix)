[Intro: Craig Mack]
Ahhhhh hah

[Verse 1: Craig Mack]
Now who got the flav that comes a dime a dozen
Keeps 'em buzzin' thinking that they phat when they wasn't
Welcome to the world of Mack (What?) or Mackman
Like Biggie Smalls might say "I eat 'em shits like Pac-Man"
I'm incredible better eat ya vegetables (What?)
'Cause, I does what I do (Do it!)
I fake the roof off of soft suckers
Super slackin', macking, full effect mic check, one, two
I'ma reign, rain forever, rain like bad weather
Reign like whoever never
You can't bite my style cause my style ain't a style
That is a style so I can go buck wild
Bet'cha figure you got more funk for flow it ain't so
Flava in ya ear let'cha know
Now I'm about a second from the hook strap ya rap book
Before you get ya wet style shook

[Chorus: Craig Mack]
Can I get down, get on down can I get down
Can I get down, get on down, can I get down

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
The Mack's like a superintendent
Burning MC's leaves a foul scent
See I'm like what ya call, king a yes ya'll
My style wreck shit, I mean real shit shit's thick
I come with the ammo
The real whammo stammo stuff that I be droppin
And I wake the great lets warm up the hot plate
I'm changing fate from the neck I'm a castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass to the stake you stunk by dominate
See I ain't scared of you muthafuckas
To me ya all suckers cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buck us we roll with the cuf
No cuf on the roof bitin' like a sabertooth
I pound on the ground when I get down
So let me get down, let me get down

[Chorus: Craig Mack]
Can I get down, get on down can I get down
Can I get down, get on down, can I get down

[Verse 3: Q-Tip and and Craig Mack]
Can leap a tall building, crush the earth for fun
But I'm sayin ain't no fair when MC's run
Lemme tell you what they do when those MC's run
They either run and get manpower or they run and get they guns
Here I stand, the rawest of the raw
We from the Queens town without the four or four
All of the sudden niggas is bustin' and frontin'
Talk about your busting titles when we're your idols
I'm looking through your minds corridor, you every thought transpires
Through the Tribe's attire
We Bad Boys to the heart and post
A Tribe Called Quest, you follow us like coats
Position like a Beamer, y'all need to stop froggin'
If I catch a beat it's in the SP organ
No Name, Ray Tip what's goin' on love?
You know shit is tough and we coming through bugged
The name of the track is "Get Down"
So let me get down and pound all these MC's in the ground

[Chorus: Craig Mack]
Can I get down, get on down can I get down
Can I get down, get on down, can I get down
Can I get down, get on down can I get down
Can I get down, get on down, can I get down
Can I get down, get on down can I get down
Can I get down, get on down, can I get down

[Outro: Don Parise]
Ayo, this is Don Parise from the 40 Projects, and Craig Mack is doin' his thing
