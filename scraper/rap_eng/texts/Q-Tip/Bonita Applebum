[Intro: Q-Tip]
Do I love you?
Do I lust for you?
Am I a sinner because i do the two?
Can you let me know, right now please, Bonita Applebum

[Verse 1: Aslo]
I got love for my mother like you don't even know
That's why she's V.I.P at
Every show
I like to treat women right
Show them girls a real nice night
Come to me, I might say hi
Be carful honey i might bite
I hope you have a thing for rappers
Where ever you go, you always looking
Dapper "that's right"
When ever you dance i dance to, "kick it"
Me and you make a real cute do. "that's right"
Yeah Bonita it's really nice to meet ya
Once i get ya there's no way i'll leave ya
Uh huh

[Hook: Aslo]
Applebum you got it going on
Bonita Applebum cuter in a thong
Know the
Words to every song
Now lets get you outta that thong

[Verse 2: Aslo]
Bonita please you love my rhymes
Tighter than a pita rubbing your thighs
When you start grinding I do to
Could name Sixty-nine things i wanna do.
Come on girl lets get physical
The way you move is just mystical
You know I make girls wet and soft, "tell 'em"
Now bonita time to take it off
Got drinks in me you do to
But when i screw you'll remember to

[Hook: Aslo]

Sex, sex, sex, freeks, freeks, peace
