[Intro: Q-Tip]
Ayo, yo, straight up and down
Like 6 o’clock, uh uh, we came to rock, uh uh
Like 6 o’clock, straight up, yo, we came to rock
Ayo, so right now I want everybody up out your seats
You know’m’ sayin’
Everybody come down to the front of the stage
Fuck security right now
Yo, we about to get in this thing like this, yo, yo…

[Verse: Q-Tip]
I stand at six feet high with no inches
Realize me, no dream, here’s the pictures
Puttin’ this shit down, where it’s supposed to be
Dimes keep approaching me, but I ain’t joking, B
Can’t you see the look in my mug, there’s no gettin’
I keep a smile on to stop the tears from sittin’
All of my niggas on the dancefloor invadin’
We always ass bettin’ while we keep the girls shakin’
But the mind is motivated towards a positive plane
Everybody across the land is recognizing the name
So what you chattin’ on, akh? You can’t out-rock
I manifest real’, you stiff than hard cock
Constantly you’re coming back for the good shit
The shit to put you inside your ride to move it
Now everybody cuppin’; what you smokin’ or somethin’?
Throw your fruits out your same tank jacket, keep jumpin’
Pay attention and bear, witness to the rare
Individual who’s truly unique on instrumentals
The Abstract, needless to say we influential
The nucleus of B-boy is inside the mental, so uh…
