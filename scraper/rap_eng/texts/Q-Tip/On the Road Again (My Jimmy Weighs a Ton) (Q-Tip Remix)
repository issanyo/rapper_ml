[Hook]
I always cry when you tell me that you'll be going back on the road again
Tears in my eyes tell me that you’re the man someday I'll be marryin'

[Verse 1: Afrika]
Beggin' me to bring it back home
Out runnin’ wild while ya home all alone
Feenin' for the jimmy, feenin' for my love
Fixed and addicted to each other like a drug
Nothin' like acid or some ecstasy
I give you pieces of my love so you'll remember me
Love letters in the mail show me that you still care
I reminisce about the kiss that turned into a love affair
I tell you now I didn't mean to do you harm
But your love was gettin' to me and my jimmy
"got hot when I..."

[Hook 2X]
I always cry when you tell me that you'll be going back on the road again
Tears in my eyes tell me that you’re the man someday I'll be marryin'

[Verse 2: Mike G.]
Mike G the honey hunter not at all the honey sweater
Chillin' on the corner when I have tune to Detta
Sweet, sweet Detta, only angels look betta
But I ain't dead yet so I best to go get her
‘Hey Detta, what it be?’ She said, ‘What you want it to be
‘Cause I've been waitin' a while for you to come get with me’
Oooh, ahhh, she touched my heart
This could be the sign of a wonderful start
‘Cause my love is that deep
To some it is a treat
Playin' me for keeps
Ball and chain at my feet
I got a curfew
But baby I don't want to have to hurt you
She said she want to run away with me
But that can't be
Because I was sixteen and she was twenty-three

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
But wait a minute Mike, let me take some to rhyme about the
Jimmy love, when we push and shove
It makes my thought of her grow more and more
Jimmy gets rave reviews ‘cause it is adored
It’s The Abstract’s position, cause clitoral infliction
From below the waistline I could do it forever and ever and ever
The black love muscle makes the girl from Cali come to Queens on the hustle
And plated when it’s touched in the right, right way
I turn your Monday into happy Saturdays
So, open up your eyes, wipe the boogers off the sides
Yo, you must know what you get so you won’t surprised
Goes right between your thighs, it’ll make your nature rise
Fill you up, girl, like five potato pies
I got the love tap and my jimmy wears a hat that’s massive
To rip the passage

[Hook (Repeat until fade)]
I always cry when you tell me that you'll be going back on the road again
Tears in my eyes tell me that you’re the man someday I'll be marryin'
