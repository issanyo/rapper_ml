[Intro: Pete Rock]
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, Ah
Check it out
InI in tha house
Rob-O, Grap Lova
Ras, Marco Polo
With the PR
To all ya fake ass thugs out there
Talking out you got this and you got that
And you got murdered this when you murdered that one
Talking all the bullshit, i'mma put to you like this
Check it out

[Verse One: Pete Rock]
As I commence lyrical content now bust the grammar
Niggas tryin to make me flip out like David Banner
Bustin out the garments slammin shit like Onyx
When I'm vex I flex and turn green like the chronic
When I bug out you bound to get snuffed out for frontin
Busy deceivin achievin nothin
If you can't walk the walk, don't talk the talk
It's Pete Rock and InI comin straight from New York
Now all the setups you thought you stepped up to get your rep up
The joke's on you jack (true dat, word)
Cause when I came through the door my mind was thinkin all out war
I'mma settle the score, once and for all
Ain't no time for fakin jax when it's time for makin stacks
I'm droppin bombs like acts in the bible with my recital
So recline like a passenger seat Son, relax
As I take you to the max, homeboy you fakin ji-dax

[Hook: Pete Rock x4]
Ain't no time for fakin jax
Stop fakin jax
Brothers that/who fake jax get laid on they back

[Verse Two: Rob-O]
Yeah, check it
You'll never succeed or progress
Searchin for peace through material objects
You go to extremes in the process
Accuse others, when it's you showin your true colors
Busy sellin your dreams, but all your cream
Contributes to your lack of self-esteem
So it would seem, cause every day of the week, you act different
You see your peoples, you speak, your eyes shifted
Frontin what Son you love to perform
But when the crowd's gone, word is bond, you get your merc on
Is this the real definition of what a snake is
Y'all should of been politicians, that's where the cake is, but
It didn't work with the fake ass smirk
See the meek shall inherit the earth, for what it's worth, uhh
Turn around yo you backwards, you know what the facts is
You fakin jax kid

[Hook]
Ain't no time for fakin jax
Stop fakin jax
Brothers that fake jax get laid on they back

[Verse Three: I Love H.I.M.]
Yo blood
Your worth lead if you can't bring home the cake to get the youths fed
We used to harvest now it's work instead
So, to get ahead to hit the nail on the head, it's hard work
Cause America jerks, takin tax and perks out the check
So father sweats from workin for the next
Just to connect, so man listen
A comfortable position's what I'm after
So all the while, I'm preparin myself to meet the master

[Verse Four: Grap Luva]
Check it
So we suggest you put a F on your chest
A wolf in sheep's clothing's what describes you best
Nevertheless, I roast your ass like chestnuts
I got guts plus cuts from Pete Rock
And it don't stop, the ghetto maths in your grill
If you lack the will to step up then please chill
On the real, real brothers got each others backs
While all these phony niggas keep on fakin the jax
It's like that

[Hook]
Ain't no time for fakin jax
Stop fakin jax
Brothers that fake jax get laid on they back
