Hey Mr. Afrika (What?) This joint is headed
Man I'm glad that beef is debted
I jolt the bullet quick out of the fifty-one six
To hear my Sammy on the mix (Aight)
We flipped the belt, I felt the rubber burnin'
See I was yearnin' for the moment
Man opponents couldn't stop me
When I first heard AC/DC I had to get a copy
Now I'm swole, who try to patrol my family
Your fantasy back in the day was to be native
But now your shit's sedated
I bring the doctor, I'm here for the remedy
But some pretend to be a bit seditty
Your atittude is shitty, I'm getting downright grimy and grity
Introducin' to the scene is Mike Giggy

[Mike G]
Yo, we sling the raw through the airwaves, we make you wanna misbehave
We gotcha hooked like the rhythm and the slaves
So catch a phase of the craze, noddin' heads for days
He's acting stingy with the level and he spreads in many ways
So if you want to test the effervesce
Come along and be my guest

Yo, cause Jungle Brothers in the House
And De La's in the house
And Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest

[Q-Tip]
Ya Ya Ya Ya
You wanna all it, y'know cause I could give it all night nigga
And make you last Mike Gigger
Africa, Sammy B, the JB's
Straight out the jungle with the natural remedy
I'm reppin', we lettin' off joints at this section
The steppin', rhymes, turntables and beats are lethal weapons
And the essence, you know we got alot like constock
The Native Tongues are here with that brew for your heart
We're makin' ample usage of the times that we see
Tell us how you want it, and we bring the strategy

[Hook]

Now imported from the planet of dope shit be the native tongue
Rocka 1 Plug infinite dot com
Getcha tail hooked in the thoughts, Dom Perignon free
Back where ladies love to hear the emcee
We be the neccessary realism
While you be chicken lo mein stream baby
What? Place it in your gut. Guaranteed
We in the lead to run rap just hand over the deed

[Africa]
Now Ya heard about, read about, be apart of it, don't front
Now I'mma play ya like the government and give ya what I think ya want
That native river, to make ya rock with one another
Cause in my eyes, I consider us all sisters and brothers
So to the table I bring fat jams to make ya sing
Cause I'm starvin', I haven't had nothing like this since Doin' Our Own Dang
So be ya P, is it ready? To flip ya pattern of speech
Cause I thinks there's heads out there we still need to reach

[Dove]
True, yo this joint is crazy get's the lazy out of
Hey yo Mikey how ya figure? I wouldn't wanna catch cold
(This joint is wisdom, kid) indeed emcee, I'm out to get old
I seek the blessed the drum pattern from brand new to tatterred and torn
This place is Jimmy crack corn
My shit's Mazola, your style's kiddy like Crayola
JBeez be the top dola, I mean dollar
Study the E-M-C-E-Es to remain the rhyme scholars

[Hook]

[Africa Baby Bam]
Record shop nine to five with the Raw Deluxe
Jungle Brother Africa - I got the Native Tongue touch
Verbal grammar - comin' atcha like a Black Panther
Check the sampler, the microphone man handler!
Crowd controller, yes we gotcha open, gotcha ampler
Shootin' the gift like Saint Nick, the black Santa
(He's checkin' his list) Say what? (He's checkin' it twice)
Yeah, You ain't gettin' shit if they naughty if ya nice
So come down the chimney, brothers the vicinity
Lock down ya block nonstop with the remedy

[Posdnous]
Similar to water out the clouds I'm here to reign supreme
Self-esteem lower than them rides in Cali
Is the reason why these niggas rally around the bull shit
Rubber duck, you can't bull shit
Occupy world-wide with frontings all the misses
These womans don't love us so we forced to talk to bitches
Tryin to ease up in the rises sayin' "I like the way you stylin'
Let me in the passenger while you play the pilot."
Listen baby doll (doll), recites is a peeper
Hair fully wooly but you mental's six ether
And I don't live that, so step up top
And watch the Native Tongues lick the crop
For the cream

[Hook]
