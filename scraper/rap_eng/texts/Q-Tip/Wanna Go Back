[Intro]
Bop-pa, bop-pa, ooo-ooh-oh
(I think I need a little help on this one)
Bop-pa, bop-pa
(Can you back me up, Marsha?)
Bop-pa (Yeah)
Ooo-ooh-oh...

[Verse 1: Solange]
Such a big, big world out there
I think I'll take a shot and go
I feel so curiously, I like to be so far away from home
So many people, places and many directions
And new bound attraction and things I forgot
But there's a reason, they say that home's where the heart is
It's tempting to stay but I know where I'm going
(I wanna go back)

[Chorus: Solange + (Marsha Ambrosius)]
(I wanna go back)
I wanna go back, I wanna go back, back
I wanna go back (oh oh babe) I wanna go back, back
I wanna go back (oh oh babe)
I wanna go back
(I wanna go back)
I wanna go back, I wanna go back, back
I wanna go back (oh oh babe) I wanna go back, back
I wanna go back (oh oh babe)
I wanna go back

[Post-Chorus: Q-Tip + (Solange)]
(Can we go back, Tip?)
We not far away, we right there (ah ah)
We not far away, (ooh ooh) we right there (ah ah oh ooh oh)
Come on, ah ah, come on, ah ah
Come on, ah ah, come on, ah ah
We not far away, we right there (ah ah)
We not far away, (ooh ooh) we right there (ah ah oh ooh oh)
Come on, ah ah, come on, ah ah
Come on, ah ah, come on, ah ah (oh baby)

[Verse 2: Solange]
It's such a scary place out there, sometimes I'd rather just lay low
(Just lay low, baby; just lay low, baby) I swear I do
But if I stay here will I know
Just what this story has in store for me (ooh ooh)

The big city jungle, the thunder and lighting (thunder and lighting)
The fast pace it moves, but it feels so electric (I wanna go back)
There's a reason they say that home's where the heart is
Tempting to stay, but I know where I'm going

[Chorus: Solange]
(I wanna go back)
I wanna go back, (wanna go back, baby) I wanna go back, back
I wanna go back, (wanna go back, baby) I wanna go back, back
I wanna go back (yeah, yay)
I wanna go back
(I wanna go back)
I wanna go back, (I, I, I wanna go back) I wanna go back, back
I wanna go back, (oh oh oh) I wanna go back, back
I wanna go back (oh oh oh)
I wanna go back, (Abstract), I wanna go back

[Post-Chorus: Q-Tip + (Solange)]
We not far away, we right there (ah ah)
We not far away, we right there (ah ah oh ooh oh)
Come on, ah ah, come on, ah ah
Come on, ah ah, come on, ah ah
We not far away, we right there (ah ah)
We not far away, (said I'm coming, baby) we right there
Come on, ah ah, come on, ah ah
Come on, ah ah, come on, ah ah

[Bridge: Solange]
Beautiful journey, how long will it last? (how long will it last?)
Yesterday, slowly, falling from this path
Just can't stay away too long (long, can't stay away too long)
Yesterday's gone (oh oh...)

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Why you making this hard? It isn't that far
No train, bus or airplane, no carriage or car
Baby, you brighter than stars, we hotter than Mars
Why stay here confined and intertwined in these bars
Of the worldly design, this treasure divine
I measured the nice route, the pleasure is mine
I know you been there before, but we gon' get more
'Cause life owes us back now, let's settle the score

[Bridge: Solange]
Beautiful journey, how long will it last? (how long will it last?)
Yesterday, slowly, falling from this path
Just can't stay away too long (long, can't stay away too long)
Yesterday's gone

[Outro: Solange]
Beautiful
It's a beautiful journey
Ah ah, oh, ooh oh, oh, ooh-ooh
