[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah
It's funny how the game change, right?
Hehe
Shit feel all different
Y'all niggas complainin' left and right about how the game feel all fucked up
Niggas only been talkin' like that since we been sittin' out the game, I think the game need us, Kamaal
Let's talk to them niggas
Huh!

[Verse 1: Q-Tip + Busta Rhymes]
So many nights were spent ponderin' (Ha)
Wonderin' how we gon' come again (Hmm)
My golden rule is not to focus on the fame game (Uh)
In retrospect (Ha), the game ain't the same, mane (The same mane)
Their heart and soul is divided (Ooh!)
They ramshack the music, no control up inside it
Now, look at this; it's all stretched out and nasty (Uh huh)
But—(What, what?) lettin' money pass me? (Wooh)
I doubt that, and niggas from the bottom know (Uh huh)
Pumpin' hard, wind, sleet, hail, rain, or snow (Uh huh)
So (So), you got to get your gate right (Right)
No matter what (Uh), you got to treat your weight right (C'mon, uh huh)
On the block if you focused on greed then (What, what?)
Nine out of ten times you be bleedin'
The analogy is clear to all of my peers
I'm a muh'fuckin' vet, don't mean to disrespect, 'cause I—

[Hook: Sample + Q-Tip + Chauncey Black + Busta Rhymes]
"I write rhymes, I write checks"
(It's clear today)
Bust', ayo, what happened to the—
(Love—)
For the game
(Love—)
For the music
(I need realness in my life)
Ayo, these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Bust', these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Ayo, what happened?
They ain't got it in 'em to make a classic
Ayo, what happened?
These niggas can't hold the torch, so why pass it?

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, I ain't bringin' they names up (Wooh!)
These niggas sound trash, straight foulin' the game up (Ha)
Need to change up (Change up), sound so trash (Ooh)
When I see 'em feel like breakin' they frame up (Ha)
DuPont registry (Ha), talkin' 'bout somebody else cars (Ooh)
Muh'fuckers better step up your bars (Ha)
Instead of frontin' in the game like niggas really are stars
Like we ain't seein' through the bullshit, we know who you are (C'mon)
I'm like a blessing to the game when your shit sound dated
I force niggas to improve, you should be happy I made it (Ha)
Here to rep the game fully, change my style like the weather
Givin' you niggas new shit to make the game feel better
I'm sayin, I cook in the kitchen and we make the thoughts connect
You forced to humble yourself, give me my big respect (Ha)
You hurtin' the game when your shit sound off, yaknow
A legend in this shit that's why I move like a boss, yaknow (Ha)
You better be tight, 'cause you can get tossed, fo' sho' (Ha)
You niggas know whassup, I come correct with money long 'cause I—

[Hook: Sample + Busta Rhymes + Chauncey Black + Q-Tip]
"I write rhymes, I write checks"
(It's clear today)
Tip, ayo, what happened to the—
(Love—)
For the game
(Love—)
For the music
(I need realness in my life)
Ayo, these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Yup, these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Ayo, what happened?
They ain't got it in 'em to make a classic
Ayo, what happened?
These niggas can't hold the torch, so why pass it?
(Yo)

[Verse 3: Q-Tip + Busta Rhymes]
Oh, my God, they'll (Uh) come ridin' around
Some (Uh) old dream and they (Uh) can't get down
They (Uh) lookin' around outside of themselves
And they (Huh!) sayin' things that ain't really themselves
And they (Ha) keep fuckin' regurgitatin' the same script (Huh)
Same hoes, same blow, same Glock clip (Ha)
Same drug strip (Uh), what the fuck is this? (Uh)
C'mon, y'all, raise the bar on this body shit (Huh!)
You sound stagnant, need to progress and grow (Uh huh)
Upgrade your punchlines, finesse the flow (Uh huh)
Get your concepts and lyrics together, ayo (Uh huh)
Then drop the bomb shit to step up the pressure, y'know? (Huh!)
I'm tired of niggas complainin' how the game changed (Ha)
You niggas should step up your game, cause you sound strange (Ha)
That's why you ain't sellin' no records, check the SoundScan
(Uh huh)
In this rap shit I command respect, muh'fucker cause I—

[Hook: Sample + Busta Rhymes + Chauncey Black + Q-Tip]
"I write rhymes, I write checks"
(It's clear today)
Tip, ayo, what happened to the—
(Love—)
For the game
(Love—)
For the music
(I need realness in my life)
Ayo, these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Yup, these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Ayo, what happened?
They ain't got it in 'em to make a classic
Ayo, what happened?
These niggas can't hold the torch, so why pass it?

[Outro: Q-Tip + Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Bust', these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Ayo, what happened?
They ain't got it in 'em to make a classic
Ayo, what happened?
These niggas can't hold the torch, so why pass it?
