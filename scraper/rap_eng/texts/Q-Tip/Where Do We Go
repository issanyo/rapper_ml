[Verse 1]
Speakers off tonight
Turn off your headlights tonight
Don't drive the road too slow
Don't look too close tonight
This used to be ours
This used to be you and I's
What used to be mine
Say your goodbyes

[Chorus 1]
And I don't know where to go
No, I don't know where to stay
Where do we go from here?
Do you know?
Where do we go from here?

[Post-Chorus 1]
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, ha ha
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, ha ha

[Verse 2]
We bowed our heads
We broke our bread that night
Shook our hands
Then conquer and divide
This used to be home
This used to be what we know
What used to belong
Now good and gone

[Chorus 2]
And I don't know where to go
No, I don't know where to stay
Don't know where to go
And I don't know where to stay
Where do we go from here?
Do you know?
Where do we go from here?

[Post-Chorus 2]
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, ha ha
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, ha ha
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, ha ha
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, ha ha
