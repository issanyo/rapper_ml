[Q-Tip]
Uh, ah, uh...

My brother Shaka would have wanted me to do it like this
So raise your glasses for the lost ones in your life...

Dilla Dawg and Master Wel would have wanted me, as well
To propel with the spirit of the mic...

Even if you had one person with you and it's hard
They make it easy, celebrate them, let them just who they are...

Because of these experiences I have some control
On the microphone, I'm bold elevating to the stars...

Here's a demonstration, with the excellence
Reverse the pandemic that's filled with pestilence
Who has his finger on the pulse of the b-boy?
Serving fiends with the stream of a d-boy
Who's well connected, you must respect it
I'm driven with the spirits mentioned in this record
Hopefully this serves as motivation
They never sayin that kind of sensation
Put my stamp on it, the mic clamps on it
Mama I know, let me put lil' thamp on it
Blade runnin through the day with agility
Stay gunnin, make way for possibilities
It's the capital Q, rap it'll do
What I want it to, it's like tamin a shrew, uh
Livin life, the Shakespearean proportions
Knowin better, I've experienced distortions
And through the in and outs, of life's revolvin doors
I'mma see that, I'm still gettin more
Yeah I'm comin in, I'm gon' see my friends
To the top floor, it seems it never ends
Heaven never ends, yeah it never ends
It be goin on, it's phenomenon
Like a new born, or a Stevie song
It be going on, do ya feel it?
(Do ya feel it? Do ya feel it?...)
The snare drum go...

My brother Shaka would've wanted me to say this to y'all
Don't lose sight y'all without giving a fight...

I'm channeling Weldon Irvine - Mr. Clean
He would've wanted me to say what I mean, and I mean give it right...

Dilla, havin you in my past has been a blast
You've inspired so many and forever will you last...

And to my father, yo your spirit is drapin me
Never escapin me, I'm happy that I had you in my past...

Uh, uh, let's go...
A-let's go...
Let's go...
Let's go...uh..
Tka, uh....
