Never lie, Pu - you know what it is
My best advice is to rock with the kid
Life is too short to stick to the script
Aye yo Grand Puba, come spit that shit

I'm good to go, flow like H2O
Let's get it in with the pro
Time to school those who don't know
Been rockin' joints like this since 13 years old
You know who I be, Grand P, high G
I don't do this for free, it's the God degree
Always do it properly, not sloppily
Like a chick standing up when she tryna pee
I'm an old head with an old soul, but I'm new
Don't waste your time hatin', just do what you do
Can't nobody stop me from doin' the Pu
Not MJ, ma, but I wanna rock with you
I go in, like a blizzard with its snow and
Take you to another galaxy, the way that I be flowin'
Listen to the way I'm rockin' with the ricky-click-a-clicky
Can't be too many more brothas who can say they flow as sick as me
Grand Puba with the homie Q-Tip
Let's get it in, y'all, 'cuz that's that shit

Never lie, Pu - you know what it is
My best advice is to rock with the kid
Life is too short to stick to the script
Aye yo Grand Puba, please talk to this chick

Listen ma, it's time to take off the Uggs, put on the pumps
Call me trampoline 'cuz I make joints jump
Where I'm from, chicks play clowns in a hurry
Soon as they up close, act like they wanna marry
But listen, no worry 'cuz we up in NY
Dudes so fly we be walkin' on sky
Bonafide spitter, kill shit like cat litter
I be the trendsetter, official like Dick Bavetta, You Boys too tight, I move better
My flow so Chiquita, I never follow
I'm a leader, I put it down like sweet cheetah pita
So what's goody, still pack hoes like Woody
Swag so tight make dykes want pipe
Born to shine, never baggin' nothin' less than a dime
But if it's slow, then I might take a nine

[Q-Tip]
And if you take a nine, then I'mma get mine
'Cuz you know your brother Tip is comin' right behind
Go and scoop up the residue
'Cuz a nigga ain't beggin', boo
It's Q-Tip and Grand Pu
So twist up your waistline, listen to the bass line
Givin' you the Face Time, talk to me, ma
Bum rappers can't decipher this
Stayin' in this life I live
Top 10 lyricists, talke to me, bruh
Don't second guess the grand one
From grandpa down to grandson, my brother covers the bass
