[Verse 1]
Yes yes y'all
I've been hearing the tone
I've been getting in the zone
I've been rappin' up a storm refusing to conform
They be skipping school
Gripping their tool
They spread all their hate
Then I'm ending their fate
A Tribe Called Quest
Is really the best
I've been playing the game
And the sadness is the same
There's a new kid in town
Who's messing around
This is for the culture
Not for all you vultures
Yes yes y'all

[Chorus]
This is for the jazz
This is for the rap
X4

[Verse 2]
Yes yes y'all
My name is Kave
And I'm ready to say
Nina Simone
She held the throne
The greatest jazzer
All you whack rappers
Are a hazard
I'm the next up
You're getting messed up
Spreading these lies
While I'm making these tries
Spreading my fire
While you're in your gang attire
Dishing my flow
And I'm making you know
You're about to expire
Good thing I'm for hire
Yes yes y'all

[Chorus]
This is for the jazz
This is for the rap
X4

[Verse 3]
Resume my rhyme
You're taking your time
Always on my grind
Making sure that I find
A reason to live
That the world won't give
My psychiatrist told me I ain't got no hope
I ain't got no pills that I can pop to cope
Reppin' Tech N9ne
I'm living divine
Why must they build a wall
To break their own fall
Politicians take all of our trust
Then end it with a crush
And in their aid
Making them fade
The people are dying
But the money is flying
Incarcerate their people
For the top of the steeple
Train your brain
Not to entertain
Knocking and blocking over a computer screen
Nah bro
Keep it clean
They censor
Making things tenser
What I know
It's not worth the risk
Hm tisk tisk tisk
Time to inspire
Some more desire
Screw the system
With all their victims
