He said, "They're really not real, they're just a front for the girls"
And a whole bunch of females just, (?)
He was in pain, so ashamed, he wish he had not came
Had to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train, yo
He went to (?) they brought/bought him a quart
Then I went to the park, and I sat and I thought

They got me drunker than a skunk and happy as can be
We went, to the Latin Quarters and we got in free
Scoopin' all the girls like nothin' with my trunk jewelry
Cause I'ma light-skinned brother and you can't school me
Peter gunz was performin' and he ain't no joke
