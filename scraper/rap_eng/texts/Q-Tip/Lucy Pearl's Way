This song simply says tribe called quest
En vogue, and Tony Toni Tone
It's a new revolution in the 2000, it's a new revolution in the 2000
That the whole world's talking about
It's a whole new revolution in the year 2000

Don't let go
Ask of you, hold on
Ask of you
Don't let go
Ask of you, hold on
Ask of you
Don't let go
Hold on

Kissing you is not enough for me
You see i'm a big boy and big boys have desires
Making love is what I wanna do
But I need a true friend to make it come together
All your love
I wanna kiss you right there
Just stand right there
Just stand right there li'l girl
All your love
I wanna kiss you right there
Just stand right there
I'm not trying to put you on the line
But I gotta tell you what's exactly on my mind gurl
My big heart leads me right to you
Every time the phone ring, I pray to God that it's you
Girl
Every time I close my eyes
A vision of your face always pops into my mind girl
I would do anything to recieve love from you
So take me by the hand and lead me to the room yeah

Don't let go
Ask of you, hold on
Ask of you
Don't let go
Ask of you, hold on
Ask of you
Don't let go
Hold on
Ask of you
Ask of you
Ask of you
