Some people tell me that I need help
Some people can fuck off and go to hell
God dam why they criticize me
Now shit is on the rise and my family despise me
Fuck em and feed em cuz I don't need em
I won't join em if I can beat em
They don't understand my logic
To my gat, to my money, and I'm hook on chronic
I never wanted to hurt a nigga
Unless you come flexing that trigger
I'll dig ya that grave on the east side of town
Now your six feet underground
From man to the dust to the ashes
All I remember tell me where the cash is!
Click clack barrel at my dome
Give all your loot or you ain't going home
But I ain't going out on a bang
Wa dada dang wa dada da dang

(Hook)

I'm having illusions all this confusion's
Driving me mad inside
I'm having illusions all this confusion's
Fuckin me up in the mind

Mother fuckas be driving me up the walls
Hoping that I fall but they can lick my balls
Straight jacket strap it
In the padded room where some punk niggas can't hack it
Distracted from all reality now I'm let out
On a minor technicality .... They all fucked up now
Cuz they let a nigga back on the street some how
I'm looking for some one like me
Living in my own world to my own degree
On the loose in the city looking at the ho with the titties
Looking at me and I feel shitty
A lil tensed up getting hot
Cuz she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot
I'm trying to find ways to cope
But I ain't fuckin around with a gage or a rope

(Hook)

I'm having illusions all this confusion's
Driving me mad inside
I'm having illusions all this confusion's
Fuckin me up in the mind
