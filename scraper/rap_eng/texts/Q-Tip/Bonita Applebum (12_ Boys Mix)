[Intro: Q-Tip]
Do I love you?
Do I lust for you?
Am I a sinner because I do the two?
Can you let me know
Right now, please
Bonita Applebum

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita...

Bonita Applebum...Bonita Applebum
Bonita Applebum...Bonita Applebum
Bonita Applebum...Bonita Applebum
Bonita Applebum...Bonita Applebum
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita...

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Hey Bonita, glad to meet ya
For the cunning, stunning you, miss, I must beseech ya
Hey, being with you is a top priority
Ain't no need to question the authority
Chairman of the board, the chief of affections
You got mine's to swing in your direction
Hey, you're like a hip-hop song, you know?
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita...

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
38-24-37 (mmm, mmm, mmm)
You and me, hun, we're a match made in heaven
I like to kiss ya where some brothers won't
I like to tell ya things some brothers don't
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
Only you and me, hun, the love never dies
Satisfaction, I have the right tactics
And if you need 'em, I got crazy prophylactics
So far, I hope you like rap songs
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita

Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on
Bonita, put me on...Bonita, put me on

Part 2

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita Applebum (go 'head with yourself)
Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita, Bonita, Bonita, come on!

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Bonita Applebum, remember way back woo
When you used to play your knickers and your pigtail 'do
I used to be all on it like a fly to shit
Back in the days, Bonita was a hit
I flirted and I flirted 'til there was no end
But you kicked the diabolical and said we was friends
Honey, you was funny but I'm tired of that
It's three years later, I got a new rap
You got a little older, a titbit wiser
I gained twenty pounds, six inches higher
Speaking of high I saw you smoke a hootie mack
Your ex-boyfriend claims he gets the booty back
But I'm here to testify it'll be a hard try
Slapping my knees, letting out sighs
Want to keep it slamming like a hip-hop song
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita Applebum (go 'head with yourself)
Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
I said Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita Applebum (go 'head with yourself)
Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita...

In the words of the immortal Sweet Daddy (uh)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I'll never shed a tear but then again I won't steer
You wrong, I steer you strong, for affection steer here
I'll take you to a place that's farther than the Uno
What do you know, if we go to El Segundo
Your presence should be closer like on "Buddy" I'll toast
To the ever clever youth, to say the least, you're the most
Honey, you're my honey, a-yo, dip, you're my dip
Treasure and forever there'll be pleasure with Tip
As we glide and move
Cushioned like a pillow that's soft and smooth
Ricky D said we got to "show and prove"
Do it to the music, that's the raw butt groove
Intimidate the boy
Cupid that's his name
Picking all us suckers is his flipping game
But Tip don't fall for that
Instead I'll get the Natives and we rush to the latest
Lambskin store, get a six-pack of hats for

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita Applebum (go 'head with yourself)
Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
I said Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita Applebum (go 'head with yourself)
Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita, uh...
