[Produced by Jungle Brothers]

(Here we go)
(Word up)(Repeat)

[Verse 1: Afrika Baby Bam]
Jungle Brother, JB for short
A biter bit my rhyme and we almost fought
But since he was a brother I thought that'd be wrong
So I let him go, I let him run along (Run along)
I write rhymes like I come from New York City
My DJ spin the music down to the nitty gritty
Running downstairs like it's five days a week
Searching and seeking for the Baby Bam beat
The Afrikan rap that comes from within us
Brothers heard about it now they wish they could've been us
We did an album with no problem
No we working on another with another Jungle Brother
(Q-Tip: Me) Q-tip, his name, he's into business, not into games
So Q-tip when the light turns green
Grab your bone and show 'em what I mean

[Verse 2: Q-Tip & (Afrika)]
My bone is grabbed, this is what I mean
I brag a grab, and here's the scene
Q-Tip, (Q-Tip) from A Tribe Called Quest
On the Jungle Brothers album (Oh yes)
So get the ducats, it's coming out soon
A month after March, two before June
It's nice, with Ali Shaheed Muhammad
My DJ who, is real dominant (Muhammad, Muhammad)
He and I form the funky Tribe
If you want to get with it, just feel the vibe (Feel the vibe)
Me and Ali are extremely witty and...
To be heard like the horn of Gideon
Get it? If not, you're a goner
Get wise or get something, 'cause you're gonna wanna
Lamp, after you hear from me
The Tip from Quest, my DJ's Ali
Say it from the Catskills to the SoHo
Listen to the words they say on The Promo
To the bewildered, let it be said
I'll mix you up more like DJ Red
So Mike G, when the light turns red
Don't stop, proceed ahead

[Q-Tip & Afrika]
Go on with your
Go on with your
Go on with your bad self

[Verse 3: Mike G]
Well, I'm going (Where?) Straight to the treetop
Eating crazy fruit, so I can't stop
Squatting here, listen to the LP
Straight Out The Jungle from the JBs
Baby Bam beat keeps the bass bottom bouncing
Suckers littering, girls ouncing
Women inching, girls pinching
Run to the record store to see if the 12-inch is in
Remixes, our fixes, we write it, you like it
Rap music, house music
No matter what it is, the JBs can do it

Ah yeah, that's right
It's coming (Repeat 6X)
Yeah. We the JBs
How much is it? 5.99? Ah, just bring a 20, whatever it is, just bring a 20
At the sound of the ring, The Promo will end. Peace
