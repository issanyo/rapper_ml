[verse 1]
Just relax yourself, girl
You are now fucking wit the best, girl
Take your cool off, no stress, girl
Make 'em say 'Uhh!' when I'm bout it
Thumbing and counting. Well damn lets get it yeah them barks in here with me yeah they sparked up the philly, biddy stuck up and sediddy but
We don't really care about that right there. She just salty cuz she the popped'est bitch to da players
Jedi mind tricks got 'em on the lightsaber. Them boys raps make me make the same sounds as darth vader
I'm sleep
For a week
Soon as I got good, half my favorites turned weak
Still its all love
Major is the league
One homie got the drink
Other got the weed
Turny-urny up niggas hurry-urry up I
Jersey-ersy up words slurry-urry up Ju
Mercy-ercyed up, Game fucked me up to tough so
Middle fingers up, but don't worry-orry none, baby
Just...

[hook]
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down (x6)

[verse 2]
Took us a drive through the night time
Sets the tone for this nice vibe
How you
Ride the 'D' get be white high
I always want you
Slightly addicted to how you sound when I cut you
Call me your dj
"Mr. one, two"
