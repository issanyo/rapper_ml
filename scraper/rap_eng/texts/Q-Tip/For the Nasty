[Intro: Pharrell, Q-Tip, Busta Rhymes]
Let me, let me, let me, let me
Let me tell you a story, yes (uh uh)
About a boy from the Tribe Called Quest (uh uh)
I be that nigga that I think y'all know
With Mr. Busta Rhymes (A-yo, I'm in the studio)

[Busta Rhymes]
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!

Girl MOOOOOVE!

[Q-Tip]
Close the door, 'ight, let a nigga rock
Cause we 'bout to eat real shit, not shit slop
Nigga can't say shit about this hip-hop
Cause I build dudes lanes while at pit stop
Built they styles and they names, Frankenstein Rock
It's a high stake game, dudes are playing it
I be questioning a lot of y'all who made it in
Just move with the joint that we chartering
Make you disappear quick, like you're part of wind
Then laugh, ah-ha ha, and laugh again
Shorty, move a lil bit, I'm looking at your friend
Let's get an ass shake for the beat, girl
Get a lil eye wink, throw a tongue twirl
We gotta him locked smashed in, tied down
We on your block, turned hot spots to ghost towns
A-yo, I'm tired of these niggas, Bus-a-Bus, now
Say it to 'em

[Hook: Q-Tip]
This is just, for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what? (Tell 'em now)

[Busta Rhymes]
Pardon me, now, gimme room again
It's time to raise the level of the boom again
NOW WHO'S THAT?! Bus-a-bus-a-bus rhyme
(RAAAAAAAWR!!!) See, I ain't do that in a long time!
Spitting shit, make the streets do more crime
Cop some cribs, cop a little more shine
Alright, yea, shh shh, mm, uh, I pity y'all
The way I bang niggas, and how I shit on y'all
And spit the slang bigger, make your label quit on y'all
And do my thang, bitch, from here to Senegal
We getting a lot of money, me and my friend, Kammal
I take your money too, I ain't a friend of y'all
With so much class, my shit will kill ya blood
(jghejhejhehjeh) When I don't wanna rap
And still I will smash and make the bitches make it clap
As soon as I'm finished with her, homie, I'll give her back
Say it to 'em

[Hook: Q-Tip]
This is just, for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what? (Tell 'em now)

[Busta Rhymes]
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know

[Q-Tip]
When the beat bang, and you're in the club
When you listen and you feel a thud
When you hear my voice, understand the love
When the DJ spins it back, it's a friendly rub
But, when I'm behind, I cannot be kind
With your waistline, and the way you move
Like a old break-beat, I'ma catch a groove
Or like a old hip-hop joint, you Nice and Smooth (Come on, girl)

[Hook: Q-Tip]
This is just, for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what? (Tell 'em now)
