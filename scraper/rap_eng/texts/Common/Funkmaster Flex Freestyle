Common, What's your twitter my brother?
(Yo @Common, check me out y'all, let's go)
Google+, all of that, this is what it is, it don't stop
Common let's go, my brother

[Common]
Yo, ashtrays and cigarettes, last days indigenous people
These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
The smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it and still get invited to white Christmases
When I was young 3 wise men came to visit us
One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle, and then start giving gifts
"You from Chicago - we want you to deliver this"
Show the walking dead who the true and living is
Separate the fake from who the real niggas is
Hot tub time machine back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings
I guess it's my addiction to women, ah!
I was in France, Hennessey blending
Writing my own rhymes like I'm Tennessee Williams
Now I'm right here with the brother named Flex
Y'all know the context, Com'll get sex
He talk about the ladies and yo yo, you see me um
He said we got them broads, yo yo they premium
That's how it is yo getting into the biz
You know Com Sense always said what it is, so yo
You should know I'm coming down, you should see a
Brother Com Sense with the album "The Dreamer, The Believer"
It's like that y'all, right here Hot 97, in Flex We Trust
