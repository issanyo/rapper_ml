[MIGO (Channing Tatum)]
Um, where are you takin' me?

[THE STONEKEEPER (Common)]
Aha, so many questions. I think it's about time I give you some answers

[MIGO]
Wow. What is this?

[THE STONEKEEPER]
You see, Migo
There was a time when Yetis lived beneath the clouds
We were alive and we were thriving till we came across a crowd
Of Smallfoot, that's right, we used to live down there
But there were actions we could not forgive down there
And though they used a different nomenclature
Man, or human, they showed us human nature
A dangerous species that we approached with wonder
They attacked with their spears and their smokin' sticks of thunder
They called us Sasquatch, they called us abominable
They chased us, pursued us, their persistence indomitable
We had no choice but to run and hide
Otherwise, we surmised we were facin' genocide
So we climbed this mountain just to stay alive
You see, we knew that up here, Smallfoot cannot survive
So it was here the first law was written in stone
It was named and proclaimed as a truth to be known
Our world is an island, it floats on a sea of endless clouds
That's how it would be
And then we wrote more laws, more rules to obey
For the sake of us all, it was the only way
To protect us from all of the human ravages
Heaped upon us by those human savages

(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
(Now you know, now you know) And new rules apply
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
So it's best just to let it lie (Let it lie)
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
(Now you know, now you know) And you can't deny
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
That it's best just to let it lie (Let it lie)

[MIGO]
But my Smallfoot, he's not like that

[THE STONEKEEPER]
They're all like that. Tell me, when you found him. Did he greet you with open arms?
They don't care about us. They don't care about anything but themselves. Which is why we must do the same if we care about our future

[MIGO]
Wait, we're below the clouds

[THE STONEKEEPER]
Or so it would seem, but look closer

[MIGO]
Those aren't clouds, it's steam

[THE STONEKEEPER]
The stones are working

[MIGO]
The stones?

[THE STONEKEEPER]
Every job and every task is pointless as it seems
All of it ensures that this important machine
Keeps turning and turning and spinnin' around
So those below don't look up and those above don't look down
And they'll look 'cause even if they hear of these atrocities
The only thing stronger than fear is curiosity
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)

[MIGO]
Wait so, so none of those stones are true, they're all lies?
(Now you know, now you know, let it lie)

[THE STONEKEEPER]
Good lies to protect our world
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)

[MIGO]
But they need to know the truth

[THE STONEKEEPER]
Oh, do they?
You feel emboldened by your noble quest to find the truth
I chalk it up to the naive innocence of youth
So let me share a secret that you'll learn as you grow older
What's true or not true is in the eye of the beholder
So do you wanna prevent our own annihilation? (Yes!)
Then our only goal should be to control the flow of information
Unless you wanna see the Smallfoot conquer and pillage (No!)
Then protect the lie and you protect the village
Lives are at stake, Migo. Your friends, your father, Meechee
She's curious and you know what they say: curiosity killed the yak

[MIGO]
So what do you want me to do?

[THE STONEKEEPER]
Tell everyone you were lying about the Smallfoot

[MIGO]
But they've already seen it, they--they're not gonna believe me

[THE STONEKEEPER]
You'll be surprised at what they'll believe
You think knowledge is power, Migo?
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
(Now you know, now you know)
Question is
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
What are you gonna do with that power?
(Hmm)
