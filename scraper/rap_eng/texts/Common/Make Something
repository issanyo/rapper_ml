[Verse 1]
The game of life, so bittersweet
Can’t waste your time lookin’ up to niggas, you never me
Belly slimmin’ and thoughts of you father figure
When your mother fill a void in your granny’s begotten sinner
We on, like mass when niggas was skippin’ class
Payin’ bills underage, we was learnin’ a different math
Autographs for your belongings, of all things
Heat here, steady revolving in Palm Springs
What’s up?

[Hook]
Excuse me, I’m just tryna get a little light
I went from starving ever other night
Life full of drama, it gon’ make a nigga take something
Take something, when I’m only tryna make something, make something
I’m only tryna make something, make something
I’m only tryna make something, make something
They be flossin’ like it ain’t nothin’, ain’t nothin’
They gon’ make a nigga take somethin’
I’m only tryna make something, make something
I’m only tryna make something, make something
They be flossin’ like it ain’t nothin’, ain’t nothin’
They gon’ make a nigga take somethin’, take somethin’

[Verse 2]
Yeah, nigga – we here now, nigga
This is dedicated to the niggas who said we’d never make it (listen)
Too many days I had a lot on my plate, not enough food
Young, tryna chop up the cake, so I cut school
Yeah, I was clutching the gate when the bell rung
Question marks in from of my name like Questlove
Nigga, I’m gone – I need the newest kicks, looked over like a Jewish kid
Stretched out – Jesus, felt like the crucifix
‘Til I get my prayer on, blacked out, my Raider on
Lord, I know you never will forsake me, let me play the song

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah… yeah… yeah…
I arrived from the Heavens to a street called ‘87
It’s crazy weapons, the way we steppin’, the daily lessons
Of the younger – we go from hunger games to wanting change
To see a bigger picture, money is the frame
From Basquiat to Nasty Nas we paint pictures
Words hit ya like ancient scriptures
We leave ‘em for the young ‘cause we can’t take ‘em with us
I coach niggas on how to get green like Doc Rivers
The plot shivers and shakes, I give ‘em work over breaks
New winner, killed the beef, because I know the stakes
It’s high like Wiz Khalifa, my man hold a fist of reefer
Put down your arm so I can reach ya, I’ll greet ya…

[Hook]
