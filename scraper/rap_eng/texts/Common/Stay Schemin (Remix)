[Hook]
I ride for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas dawg
Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas

[Rick Ross - Verse 1]
Damn, life so short, fuck it, I dont wanna go to court
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer though
Fuck it, I'm on the run for the money
I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil niggas thuggin', even got me paranoid
I'm gettin money, thats in any nigga category
Double M I got G's out in California

[Hook]
[Drake]
It bothers me when the Gods get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
Thats why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask them when you see me you speak up nigga thats all
Don't be ducking like you never wanted nothing
Its feeling like rap changed, there was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in Appolo lounge
Me and my G from DC thats how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that you never know
Million dollar meetings in appollo lounge
Me and my man all Oliver North thats how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell a bitch its more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty M's
Kobe my nigga I hate it, had to be him
Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym
(Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym)
Tell Lucien I said fuck it I'm tearing holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix and take her ass out in public
Ordered it a filet tell her butterfly she'll love it
She used to soda and nuggets she really just out here thuggin'
Im just hittin my pinnacle you and pussy identical
You like the f-ckin finish line we can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind of that
Young rich muthaf-cker getting mine off rap
With my niggas

[Hook]
[Common]
My motto is: Chicago, bitch
Everybody know you sweet, what the problem is
Don't play dumb, I'm the one that acknowledged it
Son of a bitch, I imagine what your father is
She said, "How you make your opponent, the rapper of the moment?"
His style, he don't own it
Acting all hard when he hardly like that
You gon' mess around and make me catch a body like that, ooooh
Don't do it
'Cause every song you make Joe is really hoe music
I heard you said you wasn't a bitch because you sing
You a bitch because you cling like a bitch that's eighteen
Can't say my name but rap about a nigga's wife
You so black and white, tryna to live a nigga's life
I'm taking too long with this amateur guy
You ain't wet nobody, nigga, you Canada dry
[Common Speaking]
Soft nigga, make no mistake, I'm talking to Drake
It's the remix. Rick Ross, Common, and that hoe ass nigga
No, man-to-man, don't hide behind them other niggas
Nah, this man-to-man. You can't run behind them man
This is some real man shit right here
[Destiny's Child]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady
Better say my name
Better say my name
Better say my name
Better say my name
