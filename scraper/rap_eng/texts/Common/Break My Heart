Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
(She said "Don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
(She said "Don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
With lots of love to give
(Love to give...you, you)
Love to give
Love to give

[Verse One]
It was a dream day, met her on spring break
Look like the type that be like "No hable ingl√©s"
She said you look like you rap, where's your bling'e?
And yours clothes is tight but you don't seem gay
I said naw, thats dude from NSYNC'e
She wasn't married, kept her ring on her pinky
She said "You know I dont be datin' rappers"
I said I got my SAG card, baby I'm an actor

[Verse 2]
Seen her again at All Star weekend, she ain't have tickets
And she ain't into hoopers, she was there to kick it
With her roommate who was a video vixen
Spend so much on outfits she's about to get evicted
Said "I'm married to this rap shit, looking for a mistress"
You can be by my side like Flavor and Delicious
Long as you ain't scared of the kitchen and the dishes
She said "you one of them fishes, I know your mind switches", and

[Verse 3]
Time revolve, we fell in love as crazy as Nas
And them broads was textin cuz I stop calling them
I met the parents, watch the game with her father and
Questions of marriage and I start dodging them
What happen to me happens to lots of men
Get deep in love and then your needing some oxygen
As far as wives I was thinking like Solomon
She said "there you go, breakin my heart again!"
