(Oh no...)
Yeah (Geto Heaven)
God bless...

[Macy Gray]
Hummmmm...oooh, right, need a little Geto Heaven
Need a little Geto Heaven, time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto heaven, need a little Geto Heaven (Heaven)
Geto...

[Verse 1]
Search for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third, eye on the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and to rock sweet apparel
The mother of my child, we not together
Baby, it's your back, I got forever
The weather, talks to us
Henrock, the Holy Spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall, of a nation, even when the buildings tumble
I still stand tall, I walk through the valley, wit a life preserver
Feeling at times, that I might just murder
Yo, that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than any car, any rock, or any broad
He found Geto Heaven in himself and God
(Found Geto Heaven in himself and God)
Found Geto Heaven in himself and God

[Hook: Macy Gray]
Geto Heaven... (Need a little...)
Need a little Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven...(Need a little...)
Time we get some Geto Heaven
Geto...

[Verse 2]
Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man?
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talking to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, 'cause he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You never find a man, 'til you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
One man F'd up, men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At that destination, a king will anoint you
Going through the storm, many bodies seem warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you're worth more
Than anything you could cop at a store
For you to grow, he had to go, so what you stoppin' him for?
Not even I could ignore being alone is hard
Find heaven in yourself and God
Find heaven in yourself and God, girl
(Find heaven in yourself and God)

[Hook: Macy Gray]
Geto Heaven... (Need a little...)
Need a little Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven...Need a little...
Time we get some Geto Heaven
Geto...
La, la, la, la...

[Verse 3]
This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, it's like a trigger to me
Dealing with crab rappers, groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
To choose words, be heard across waters
Doing something you like to support daughters
Keeping your guys from collecting court orders
Conveying messages the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I opened it, used it, hoping you could grow to it
Whether servant or a surgeon, you gon' go through it
Can't imagine going through it, without soul music
It's like Donnie Hath' helped me see Lonnie's path
On my behalf, let's take whole steps towards hotep
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and God, yeah
(Find heaven in this music and God, y'all)
Find heaven in this music and God, check it, it's Geto Heaven, baby

[Hook: Macy Gray]
Geto Heaven... (Need a little...)
Need a little Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven...Need a little...
Time we get some Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, need a little Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, time we get some Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, need a little Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, time we get some Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, need a little Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, time we get some Geto Heaven...
