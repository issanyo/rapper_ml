[Verse 1: Estelle]
Don't you feel sometimes
You don't work too hard to find
Just an average piece of mind
Just a little chance to shine
Don't you feel sometimes
When there's nowhere else to hide
That's exactly bout the time
That you pull from deep inside

[Verse 2: Common]
I went to New York with 4 days to close
It's 6 million ways, I had more ways to floss
Rose like Derrick on Chicago Bull
Knew a couple of pushes, ask Chicago Bull
But now it was time for the world to use it
The big city lights I was lost in music
The victorious, thinking big like notorious
History of the warriors, get so glorious

[Hook]
So I made a way, and we changed the game
So that we can say, and we'll stay like say
We are victorious, victorious, we are victorious
We are victorious, victorious, we are victorious
And we say, yeah we say, we are victorious

[Verse 3: Estelle]
Don't you doubt that I
I've been where you are yes I'm
In the middle of my fight
But I'm sure I'll get... (don't give up)
Won't let them win, won't you worry they expecting
I'mma get where I'm getting
Step in my own directions

[Verse 4: Common]
Am I about the critics, for how I spit it
Am I about the people, for how I live it
Give, give it, the best that I've got
I need a vacant lot, always cold
They said I need to make it hot
On the radio, I wasn't getting played a lot
But somewhere in your hearts, y'all saved a spot
Now I pose like mike when he made the shot
Something the lord made, now we done made a lot

[Hook]
