Breathe

Sometimes the monster that’s inside you
Is a monster that is mad
It’s a monster who is angry
It’s a monster who feels bad
When your monster wants to grow things
And your monster wants to shout
There’s a way to calm your monster and chill your inner monster out

Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it
Belly breathe this is how you do it
Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it
Belly breathe this is how you do it

Put your hands on your tummy now you’re ready to begin
Put your hands on your belly and you slowly breathe in

Ba ba breathe belly belly
Ba ba ba ba breathe belly belly breathe

Feel your belly go out and in and in and out
And you start to calm down without a doubt
Feel your belly go in and out and out and in
Now Elmo feels like himself again

Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it
Belly breathe this is how you do it
Ba ba breathe belly belly
Ba ba ba ba breathe belly belly breathe

Your mad monster may appear at any time and any place
And that mad monster will make you make a mad monster face
He makes you want to push he makes you want to shove
There’s a way to calm that monster bring out the monster love!

Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it
Belly breathe this is how you do it
Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it
Belly breathe this is how you do it

Feel your belly go out and in and in and out
That’s what belly breathing is all about!

Feel your belly go in and out and out and in
And now I feel like myself again!

Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it
Belly breathe this is how you do it
Belly belly breathe
Belly belly breathe
Everybody just breathe!
