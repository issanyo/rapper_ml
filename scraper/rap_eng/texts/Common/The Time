[Verse 1: Common]
Post-apocalyptic, the most hip-hop terrific
Young, gifted, and black, it's never monolithic
To be non-specific, some pontific
On some Z. Elliott, they wanna run with it
Overzealous zealots, my alias should to be rebellious
'Cause I deliver on some mail-y ish
The message is where the oppression is
It's single mothers, pressure, and aggressive kids
My rhymes'll be the Ritalin, let's get it
And America's divided, the dividend is the middlemen
We need to cut 'em, out, 'cause can't nobody govern the route
Of my destiny, Ebony covers and lovers, I respect them like they all mothers
And I'm...

[Chorus]
Ready and I don't want to wait
I know my glory's on the way
There's time in life where there'll be tradeoffs
I give thanks, I'm not afraid
I know my glory's on the way
There's time in life where there'll be tradeoffs
I give thanks, I'm not afraid

[Verse 2]
Opps and opulence, pops said confidence
Glocks and consciousness, sounds of black optimists
Glasses clink, I get cheers like a toast, I'm butter baby, come close
Spent years with Mos, Talib, Tariq, Jeru, and Kanye
Somewhere in my Top 5 is Nas, BIG, and Andre
Soundwaves of underground days
We found ways to surface, bringing heaven where earth is
Verses become churches, not for you to worship
But to find your purpose, rhyme's a divine service
Soundtracks to life, the way we find Curtis
I play "The Makings of You" for my daughter in the womb
Hope she still in tune, time for concrete roses to bloom
And I'm

[Chorus]
Ready and I don't want to wait
I know my glory's on the way
[?] tradeoffs
I give thanks, I'm not afraid
I know my glory's on the way
[?] tradeoffs
I give thanks, I'm not afraid

[Outro]
Know my glory's on the way
[?] tradeoffs
I'm not afraid
Know my glory's on the way
[?] tradeoffs
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid (not afraid, not afraid, not afraid)
