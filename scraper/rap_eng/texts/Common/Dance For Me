I come up in the dance with a slip of sensi
Whether peanuts, epitome too or envy
A family affair, everything is carefree
I ain't get up off the wall until I heard Mary

[Mary J. Blige]
If you dope and real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me
If you feelin the groove
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me
And I know you been stressed
This whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor
And just dance for me
Just be here ain't no joke
So stay here till we're closed
Stay up on the floor
Just dance for me

Haven't always been rough
But I'm tryna make it easy
For everybody to dance for me
So come one come all come everybody
Me and you all of us bout to really party
And you know that we're gonna put it down
At the tip more drinks we be feelin the sound

If you dope and real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me (come dance with me)
If you feelin the groove
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me

Get off the wall
Cos I know that you can feel me
So stop the frontin'
And dance for me
So come one come all come everybody
Me and you all of us bout to really party
And you know that we're gonna put it down
At the floor more drinks and we're fallin down

If you flowin real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me
And I know you been stressed
This whole week got you messed up
Stay up on the floor
And just dance for me

Leave all your struggles and your cares behind
Don't you worry bout a thing not tonight
Don't drink too much
Because we have all night
Don't you rush because it's all night long

If you dope and real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me (dance for me)
If you feelin the groove
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me (ohh dance for me)
And I know you been stressed
This whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor
And just dance for me
Just be here ain't no joke (dance for me)
So stay here till we're closed
Stay up on the floor
Just dance for me (ohh)

While ladies shake they thangs, brothers chains swang
Dancing is a ritual we used to maintain
Whether steppin' or crip walkin'
Over music, shit talkin
Hard times get softened in spots we hit often
Off in a loft, basement party or a strip club
Good times, good wine, gotta skeet to trick dubs
It's up to you, I ain't gon' tell you where your hands should be
Like the ghost of Marvin, come on and dance for me

If you flowin real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me
If you feelin the groove
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me
And I know you been stressed (dance for me)
This whole week got you messed up (dance for me)
Get on the floor (dance for me)
And just dance for me (dance for me)
Just be here ain't no joke (dance for me)
So stay here till we're closed
And stay up on the floor
And just dance for me

If you dope and real hot (come on, come on)
And you feelin the vibe (come on, come on)
Won't you get on the floor (come on, come on)
And just dance for me (come on, come on)
If you feelin the groove (come on, come on)
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me
And I know you been stressed
This whole week got you messed up
