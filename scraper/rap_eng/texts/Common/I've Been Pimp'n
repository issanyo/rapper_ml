[Hook]
I've been pimpin'
And I've been raw
With tunnel vision
I saw before
Though I know I stumbled sometimes and stayed on my grind
And now I find there's things that I don't know
There's things that I don't know (x3)

[Verse 1]
It's the return of the
Don't call it a comeback, I've been here
Let those who hear hear, those who see see
Don't fuck with tv, unless it's a ballgame
See love it life is all game
Small chains can cause pain, it's all game
Infinitely, the world spins, (?)
Sent to MC and open souls
Golden rose, the color of a dream I had
I walk this path to redeem my dad
Seeds I have will be my redemption

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Slapped by (?) on the corner
As far as rap, I boxed in myself in the former
Years of my career, now it's clear that I wanna
Appear to my peers, yo I'm here for the corner
Stones, hustlers, lords, disciples
Gangs are tribal in means of survival
(?) fund-raisers
I'm passing out bibles and rifles
Teaching the youth how to ride life's cycle
The night blows
Wind, let me know that God is in motion
Balance the motions, soft and hard as the oceans
Many ends seem to close in
Death is where life begins
Redemption

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
To the world, he's nothing
To the block, he's the God
My guy pushing weight, like he in the yard
What good is a player without a squad?
You in the game, play hard
Hustling is like a day job
I'm in overtime, trying to open mine
Seen the riches souls defined in the forest people
It's like the chorus, the street view
That people sing together
Blackouts and rapouts bring the scene together
African kings and queens
That's why we (?)
Remember King
To let us swing humble at the gas station
I seen a fiend mumble
Redemption
