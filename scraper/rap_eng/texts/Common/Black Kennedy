[Pre-Chorus: Common]
If I was a Kennedy, I'd be a black Kennedy
Black car, black tux, this is black symmetry
Raised in the Chi though my family from Tennessee
I remember me, 'Riem, Dilla, we was in the D

[Chorus: Samora Pinderhughes]
Riding through the city with the top down
We ain't got no ceilings to our thoughts now
It's a beautiful ride
Riding through the city with the top down
We ain't got no ceilings to our thoughts now
It's a beautiful ride

[Verse 1: Common]
Let the sun grow, I roll through the jungle on the humble
Got compassion from my mother, streets from my uncle
One code of honor is to move with no drama
Know thyself, know gettin' money, know karma
Hold respect like a charm that I got from my momma
In the palm of my hand, it's like a land that I'm fond of
A calm dove, Lon love, the black Dalai Lama of
Feed the masses with two fish for one love
The sum of all pieces
Release new releases to release us from the beast is the thesis
I used to give my lil' cuz cleatses
It's what I used to get my grandmother pieces, she love sequins
Diahann Carroll-like, some of these leaders are pharaoh-like
Let the people go so they can face the east and grow
Time for everything, everything is seasonal
I dreamed enough everything is believable, it's feasible

[Pre-Chorus: Common]
If I was a Kennedy, I'd be a black Kennedy
Black car, black tux, this is black symmetry
Raised in the Chi though my family from Tennessee
I remember me, 'Riem, Dilla, we was in the D

[Chorus: Samora Pinderhughes]
Riding through the city with the top down
We ain't got no ceilings to our thoughts now
It's a beautiful ride
Riding through the city with the top down
We ain't got no ceilings to our thoughts now
It's a beautiful ride

[Verse 2: Common]
Macaroons, easy afternoons
Shorties buck shots under blacker moons
In search of yellow suns, undeveloped ones
They get hella guns, heat and melanin
The streets where we from, beats heavy drums
Wish I could put Jordans on the feet of everyone
Black Kennedy, royalty with black identity
Leader of the freestyle, I go to penitentiaries
And write with the fight of Reverend Wright from Trinity
For centuries, they'll remember me for my similes
But I metaphor more than that
No matter how rich I get, I'ma pour it back
The jurisdiction of justice, non-fiction of a hustler's heart
From dust we start
And we must embark to passion mark the people
Had our first black prez, I'ma be the sequel

[Pre-Chorus: Common]
If I was a Kennedy, I'd be a black Kennedy
Black car, black tux, this is black symmetry
Raised in the Chi though my family from Tennessee
I remember me, 'Riem, Dilla, we was in the D

[Chorus: Samora Pinderhughes]
Riding through the city with the top down
We ain't got no ceilings to our thoughts now
It's a beautiful ride
Riding through the city with the top down
We ain't got no ceilings to our thoughts now
It's a beautiful ride
