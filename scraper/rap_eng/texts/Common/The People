[Vocal Sample]
Louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder
Louder, louder, Yeah
[Repeat]

Yeah, it's for the people

[Bridge: Common]
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Ye' you know how we do, we do it for the people

[Verse 1: Common]
And the struggles of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was  harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end trying to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture
Everyday we hustlin', trying get them custom rims
Law we ain't trusting them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of punching it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touching them
The People

[Hook: Dwele]
The days, have come
Now we, are one
Just take, your time
And then, you'll find

[Bridge]
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo

[Verse 2: Common]
The people said that I was sharp on TV
At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what, the people gon' see me
Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe, until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys
Visions realize, music affected lives
A gift from the skies, to be recognized
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

[Hook: Dwele]
The days, have come
Now we, are one
Just take, your time
And then, you'll find

[Verse 3: Common]
From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana
I see the I in We, my nigga, yours is my drama
Standing in front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake
The People

[Hook: Dwele]
The days, have come
Now we, are one
Just take, your time
And then, you'll find
