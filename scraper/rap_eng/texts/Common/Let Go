[Intro: Samora Pinderhughes]
There’s places I go I can’t tell you about
There’s things I have done I can’t carry around
I need to let go, I need to let go

[Verse 1: Common]
Sittin’ in the shadow of me, gradually battlin’ me
A fall from grace like Adam and Eve
Search for the inner-Vatican in me
The temple, the body, I’m mental, I’m godly
Somehow I made my mess-ups my hobby
Is it the stress and the pressure? Probably
Out here with much anger inside me
Don’t know who my friends are, stranger inside me
Stranger things, gettin’ high clipped off my angel wings
Thought I was gonna fly when Obama became the king
Pain and disdain are the rings that I wear
It’s just the price of life when things ain’t as fair
To pay dues and you still owe something on em
When you bruised and they still want something from you
Run through my mind, trippin’ over time
It’s moving faster than me, haphazardly
So much drive that I crashed into me
Father, will time be my last enemy?
What will my soul be worth when you cash in on me?
I’m bent, prayin' on passionate knee

[Chorus: Samora Pinderhughes]
There’s places I go I can’t tell you about
There’s things I have done I can’t carry around
I need to let go, I need to let go
In a state, in a place
Whatever worth I get appraised
Don't wanna wait for Heaven’s gates
A hellish thing is too much weight
I need to let go, I need to let go

[Verse 2: Common]
The best souls reach thresholds and can’t let go
Empty room, wishin’ for a miracle to echo
In my mind, I hear times can stay ghetto
Born rebel, havin’ my own inner-Aleppo
Saved by the blood then I should be a vessel
Just another Jacob, with God I wrestle
I deal with the Devil, temptations [?]
Tryin’ to get the spirit right, reflection’s in the way
How many lessons in a day do I need
Before I get on my demons, see the fruits of my seed?
It was written I read, I keep gettin’ Rocky’d
In a fight with my mind, from these decisions, I bleed
I’m supposed to go high when they go low
I forget the big picture and snap like a photo
Solo in a crowded room, seein’ myself like a powder room
In my eyes clouds of doubt and gloom
Between me and the sun, it’s weed in a gun
I yell freedom cause I’m free to be dumb
When it's all done, will I have heaven's dress code
And been able to let God and let go?

[Chorus: Samora Pinderhughes]
There’s places I go I can’t tell you about
There’s things I have done I can’t carry around
I need to let go, I need to let go
In a state, in a place
Whatever worth I get appraised
Don't wanna wait for Heaven’s gates
A hellish thing is too much weight
I need to let go, I need to let go
