[Intro]
A-B-C, A-B-C, A-B-C, A-B-C
1-2-3, 1-2-3 (Robotics)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Simple as that for your simple ass
Ask about that, pretty simple man
I'm dreaming on good for a sicker plan
Sicker than any other nigga could be thinking, and
I can't be a loser, could've figured that
I can't be a lame, I'm cooler than that
I feel I love the fame, then I hate it back, hmm
Thinking now what I should be twitterin'
Why'd big bro take all the hot bitches?
Dear God, me too, I like the hot bitches
I'll be the underdog, all along, 'til I'm gone
I will live through a song, I'll be strong through the haters

[Hook]
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that
As simple as (1, 2, 3)

[Verse 2]
Uh, simple as that for your simple ass
Simple way I wish you would've called it how it should've been
They try to tell me they don't get it, they don't underdig
Now I'll be damned I came this far to let a fool live
I gotta terminate the hate, spread the positive
Without it being wack and cheesy to the little kids
So I curse like a sailor and I smoke weed
I am exactly who an older rapper's kids be
And who they love, hands to the universe
Probably think they drug addicts if they spit a Cudi verse
Mad lil mama switch to Converse without a purse
Long as the booty lookin' juicy and he stylin' on 'em

[Hook]
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that
As simple as (1, 2, 3)

[Narration: Common]
As our hero seems to be dreaming in peace
A dark chapter unfolds
Throwing Scott into the most eerie
And unstable part of his imagination
So intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality
This is the Rise of the Night Terrors
