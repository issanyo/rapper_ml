[Intro: Wale]
May the optimism of tomorrow be your foundation for today

[Chorus]
The spotlight on my fans
Sunshine, I can’t tell a lie
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now

[Interlude: Wale (Rick Ross)]
I can't lie I feel quite phenomenal today baby, yeah
That new black soul shit, this that new black soul
That new black soul
Bounce, bounce
It's so soulful at the moment
(I'm just happy to be apart of it)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Born to be poor, chose to be rich
Black Panther party, nigga hold up your fist
Food on my plate, gold on my neck
Nigga lace up your sneakers and go and get some respect
Cover my body with ink, I never cherished the flesh
And buy a funeral home because niggas bury the best
Which is sad to say, but did you graduate?
Debatin' Ivy League over the UCLAs
I struggled at math therefore perfected my craft
In the back of my mind I said "Establish your staff"
Right or wrong niggas make mistakes
You shed your tears and then you wiped your face
You hold your head to the sky, you put your face in the light
Makaveli the Don, I pray I make it tonight
They never said that the odds were fair
Now we standin' in line for that Obamacare
Pray for a better today, bring my brother home
Nigga murdered a child, what the fuck you was on?
I just wanna let my top down
But I'm still runnin' from the dark cloud
It got me prayin' for some sunshine
You got me prayin' for that sunshine
And I'm prayin' for a better day
I'm just prayin' for a better day

[Chorus]
The spotlight on my fans
Sunshine, I can’t tell a lie
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now

[Verse 2: Common]
I'm drinkin' Cabernet, think of better days
Rock 'til my beard is gray like Frank Bev and Maze
In this maze they called us the black rats
Because we trap from the projects, we stack that
Hopin' I reach twenty one, nigga black jack
Blackstrap molasses in the backpack
Dreamin' of the pussy that I slept on, cat nap
Moon walk like Mike Jack, but never backtrack
I hold the MAC that
Them panthers and the black cats used to hold
The Kendrick Lamar Odom cause I lose control
When it comes to dope raps, yeah nigga you can quote that
Used to hold back like a masseuse
The fruits of my labor is to produce
On Netflix watchin' Juice
I wanna 2pac the people
That mean keep 'em regal, at the same time lethal

[Chorus]
The spotlight on my fans
Sunshine, I can’t tell a lie
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now

[Verse 3: Wale]
I don't like to boast but they ain't touchin' the flow (nope)
Fuck a therapist, I put everything in this cone
My only fear is marriage she scared of bein alone
She settle for this bread so therein should be a trophy
I'mma prolly marry somebody already familiar
VH1 10 and I'm not thinkin about these bitches
Can do without opinions
Another brother caught up in the business
Had that lock since I lost my scholarship
I been gettin' it to my old coach and ballin'
Rose gold was forty, dopest nigga recordin'
Make hoes sprint the 40
See me I thought money would change it it got worse
But its alot better than screamin "who got work?" (who got work?)
From opening up for Back to packing out 9:30
I never sold crack when crack rappin was workin
With that fact its back packin and murkin
Gettin' that Bobby Heenan while you Mr. Perfect

[Outro]
We ain't posed to never ha-
We ain't posed to never have
