[Intro: Karriem Riggins]
Yeah...
Oh

[Chorus: Karriem Riggins]
Spirits move me, coming through me
Feel it going, coming on strong
I got something to say, say, say, say
I got something to say, say, say, say
Spirits move me, coming through me
Feel it going, coming on strong
I got something to say, say, say, say
I got something to say, say, say, say

[Verse 1: Common]
Symphony [?]
The epiphany of text, it's like the chemistry of sex
Treatment of [?]
That I stood on, may be hood strong
I kept my hood on, and put my hood on
The world would know 'em
Blessings to my man named Del
Issue with his colon, we all swollen
Inflamed omens, Ingrained moments, of truth
That guide us to our inner Moses
Staffs, rivers, crosses, niggas, burning in the slithers
Of America, we wearin' the racism like the old jacket
These are alkaline rhymes with no acid
I'ma do some shit and I'ma be cold at it
Lying to a chick, man that's my old habits
Daughter talks, divine order caught
Me by the collar, what it is to be a father
I made some mistakes, some things I was good at
You take away the bad then you gotta take the good back
It's all a journey, she came though us for us to teach us
And for me to learn me 'till the judge adjourned me
I'm the attorney of a Universal law
Fill out a application and I gotta circle raw, aww
Feeling it, willing it to existence
Living in temptation, living in resistance
Got to know persistence, it helped me travel the distance
Now in a battle, I find what bliss is
Got a wish list for my people at the crib to get it right, right, right
Got a wish list for my people at the crib that we can get it right, right, right
Got a wish list for my people in the bright lights
That we can use the light right, right, right, right, right, right
Or invite to type, invite to [?], produce, seduce
What can I do to induce the type of thoughts to [?]
The angel wings
(Fades out)
