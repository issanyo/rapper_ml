[Intro: Common]

Joss Stone
Uh, Common
It's for the world

[Verse 1: Joss Stone]
You don't have to make your mind up
I just wanna take my time with you (yeah)
If that's alright  (it's alright, alright, yeah)
Ooh, forgive me if I get too shy, but (what?)
Maybe you're the reason why, love (uh)
I'm feelin butterflies (I feel it too, uh)

Something 'bout the look in your eyes
Ooh, it just makes me feel so right (oh oh)

[Hook: Joss Stone]
When my mind's void
You're my joy
You're the dream - when I sleep and
Hey, I'm for ya
Yeah, I adore
You're everything - that I need
I love how you love me (say what?)
If I'm made for you, you're made for me
It's too good to be
So tell me what we're gonna do now

Oh
Oh
Oh
Yeah
Tell me what we're gonna do now
Oh
Oh
Yeah
Yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Joss Stone]
Funny how my world keeps spinning
Sometimes you can be so silly
You know just how to make me laugh (ooh ooh)
Your skin is so lovely
You move me when you touch me
I know that you got my back (oh oh)

It feels so safe when you hold me (mmm)
It's already like you know me (oh why)

[Hook]

[Bridge: Joss Stone]
Ohh! Right now (right now, right now, right now)
See, baby, I love how you make me smile (you make me smile)
Don't leave, please stay a while (a while)
Let's make this happen
I don't care how!

[Verse 3: Common]
Right now let's stay in the present
Can't worry about tomorrow cuz today is a blessing
The world in a state of aggression
I find calm in you, I see my mom in you
It's like the feeling in your stomach when you want it so bad
If you keep keeping it fresh, it ain't gonna go bad
I've been through the valley of love
Rode through shores of Cali just to find piece of mind
Looking to the sky, asking for at least a sign
Beautiful you came at such a decent time
When we combine, it's like good food and wine
Flavorful yet refined, you remind me of the divine
So easy, love can be lost and then found
Like Stevie, I just love having you around
You wearing the gown, I'm wearing the crown
Pound for pound, we the freshest couple in town

[Hook]

Ooh!
Tell me what we're gonna do
Tell me what we're gonna do now
Ooooh
Uh huh
Tell me what we're gonna do now
Yeah yeah
Uh huh
Yeah
Tell me what we're gonna do
