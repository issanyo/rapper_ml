[Verse 1: Common]
She seen pain in my eye
Men and women at work, cranes in the sky
We gon' keep building for our children's children
Doctors keep pilling, love is a drug then drugs can't heal 'em
But listen to Lauryn for the healing, peeling back layers
Pops used to hoop, I'm from a bloodline of players
Love and sunshine like Roy Ayers
Put your mind on the phone, I ain't coming back home
I felt the death of what it is to be alone
Everlasting love, money can't buy
Can't hide from the truth even when I pop the lock
Can't work it away, can't drink it away
Can't laugh it away, can't think it away
That pain come up on you like a thief in the day
Searching for the sun, I found my Issa Rae
Insecurity cold, imperial robes
I used to wear my heart open like Ethereal Rose
Now I'm carrying loads of baggage I don't claim
If she start tripping I'm hopping on the plane
Cranes in the sky, I know how the metal sound
I never settled in life so it's hard to settle down
Staying on my square trying not to get around
Hold my lady hostile, she could rebel down
Don't touch my hair, I'm baldheaded
Kept my love locked down like it was all dreaded
Wishing for wings again so I could spread it
But now it's in a plastic cup of false beverage

[Verse 2: Solange]
I tried to drink it away
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair

[Verse 3: Solange]
I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress would make it better
I tried to work it away
But that just made me even sadder

[Verse 4: Solange]
I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around in circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away
Away

[Refrain 1: Solange]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

[Hook 1: Solange]
Well it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds

[Verse 5: Solange]
I tried to run it away
Thought then my head be feeling clearer
I traveled 70 states
Thought moving round make me feel better

[Verse 6: Solange]
I tried to let go my lover
Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover
To write it away or cry it away
Don't you cry baby
Away

[Refrain 1: Solange]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

[Hook 2: Solange]
But it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal...

[Refrain 2: Solange]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
