I used to love her, yeah, I used to love her, ah ahh
I used to love her, ahh, I used to love her, ah ahh
I used to love her, ahh, but drop the …

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she was five foot six, thicker than molasses, glasses
Hair reaching down to her assets, sat next to her on the train
Cracked a joke and I found my way into a conversation about fate
And personal information, until the train pulled into a station
She was feeling me I told her I will hit her then but I ain’t get her number
Another coulda been

[Hook x2]
You're always there in my love
Always there ..true (see this girl)
You're always there (keep her in my dreams) in my love
Always there ..true

[Verse 2]
Here go another one, another young five foot seven
Heaven sent angel, no halo just the wings
Flyer than the other broad walking down the boulevard
Me I’m the car admiring from afar
Hey ma’, may I have a moment of your time
As polite as I could be, so she proceeded to the ride
I really dig your vibe and them light brown eyes
I hate to say swag but dag its down tight
I’m downright impressed, me and you would mesh
I’m not another brother tryin’ to get under your dress
I’ve been looking for this girl right, see her at night
When I snooze and I’m thinking now she might be you
Then she replied: I respect your smoothness
But truth is, I’m not the one you’ve been looking for
I was booked four months ago today, and now I’m engaged
Sorry babe!

[Hook x2]
You're always there in my love
Always there ..true (see this girl)
You're always there (keep her in my dreams) in my love
Always there ..true

[Verse 3]
Getting something real is real hard
I’m done going after these youngins' at house parties and little bars
‘cause Phil been doing Phil's part
I’ve been looking for this dream girl everywhere I still got nodda'
’cause all the good ones taken
And all the bad joints at the clubs still faking
My heart been vacant, I’ve been knocking down youngins since high school
Now I think it’s time too cool off
Kick my shoes off with a youngin, ‘cause I’ve been a Free man
Like the Boondocks' fam
I’m in this adult swim with no life guard
No wife under arms like Right Guard
The right broad been sitting in my head
And I spend time with her every night I go to bed
She know what I want and I've grown to love her
But I’m looking for something real, so fuck her

[Hook x2]
You're always there in my love
Always there ..true (see this girl)
You're always there (keep her in my dreams) in my love
Always there ..true

I don't love you no more girl
