Rough

Never give up

Oh Oh Oh

Never give up

Yeah yeah

There is a place for us
So far away
But it's closer than it was yesterday
Now we are riding
Along the road together
As one we must stay
But there's one thing that we can't forget
And that be

Never give up
Things are gonna get rough
I've got to keep on movin
Never give up
I can't say it enough
We've got to keep on movin
Never give up
Things are gonna get tough
Never give up
I've got to keep on movin
Never give up
I can't say it enough
We've got TO

A trial and tribulation
Cannot get in our way
We've won though
And that's going to play?
Fussing and fighting
No longer has a place
We've got no time to waste
But there's one thing that we can't forget
And that be

Never give up
Cause things are gonna get rough
I've got to keep on movin
Never give up
I can't say it enough
We've got to keep on movin
Never give up
Cause things are gonna get tough
I've got to keep on movin
Never give up
I can't say it enough
We've got to keep on movin
FORWARD!
