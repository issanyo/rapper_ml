[Verse 1: Common]
Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile, happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'ma do the best I can do
Cause I'm my best when I'm with you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you?
(Nothing, nothing)

[Verse 2: Common]
Put down your bags love
I know in the past love
Has been sort of hard on you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealing wit this water love
We dealing wit this water love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
We dealing wit this water love
We dealing wit this water love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
We dealing wit this water love

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you?
(Nothing, nothing)
