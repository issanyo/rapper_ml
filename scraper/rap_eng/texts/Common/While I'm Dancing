"It's real hip hop"
"From the soul y'all"
"That's why"
This is how my life is
"Now don't forget that"
"Because"
"I lost love once in my lifetime"
"Now I'm realizing that I love her"
"Hip hop"
This is how my life is
"Now I'm realizing that I love her"

Back to Resurrection

[Common]
Night breathes
We hustle to fulfill life's needs
Travel at light speed, the appetite for bright weed
Got, seeds to feed in-between greed and need
Deep in the struggle and a nigga need to breathe
So I drift back to where I used to sip 'gnac and kick back
Behind schools remembering I'm king, I don't forget that
There are rules to the game that gave, I've got to give back
I drop jewels, knowing what I speak, I've got to live that
Solace sings a song that's in tune with my dreams
I sing a song like Bob Marley to redeem
Itching for some scratch like a fiend
I wait/weight like that dope that you put up on the beam
Though paper won't make my whole world serene
It will help a nigga do his thing
Through every rhyme scheme I move closer to the supreme
For those in prisons over rhythms I interpret dreams
Tell cats with the block [?] we on the same team
Revolutionary, underground against the mainstream
Tell cats with the bling we on the same team
The world is yours for you to claim king

C'mon
We keep it going c'mon we get it going y'all
We keep it going c'mon we get it going now
This is what life is, we keep it going now
This is what life is, we keep it going y'all
This is what my life is, I got a wife/kid
And another one, I'm the brother son and the mother son
That's the connection
My brother Ah said take it back to Resurrection
