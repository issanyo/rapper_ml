My mind blows decisions at times indecisive, I think about the paradox that life is, keep my head to the sky and understand who Christ is, turn off the news cuz everyday is a crisis, lifeless ni..as on the couch weeded out, itLike ladanians certain types of ni..as out my life I weeded out, I believe in the route of soul before paper, no gold before labor, truth told with no glazieurs, days are getting darker quick, I was told that it was written Imma author it, wanna go the same place that the martyrs went, the Black figures on the wall in my apartment, like LaDanian yall I be charging it, touching down with the people from my town, its the Chi that be giving me my ground, dug in the crates of my soul and I found, clarity

Chorus:
Be yourself, yeah and be so clear
Heyo just be yourself, and be so clear
Be yourself, yeah and be so clear

C'mon just be yourself, and be so clear
(repeat x 2)

Verse 2: Guru
Toiled in the trenches, faced judges on benches, betrayed by some that I fed not to mention, standing here now in the best condition, up outta the dirt so I suggest you listen, see money can't make you or me, protect my mind with nines cuz it shines more than jewelry, used to do things that werent too productive, now I breathe life into mics for your comfort, I see past the groupies and goldiggers to find women, how I'm living? doing me and not savagely driven, taught the game of fortune and fame so I'm not playing no more I hold the torch with flames, I've lost and gained at the same time, mc's biting and swagger jacking still commit the same crimes , once you see past the surface, that trash is worthless, with me you get a lasting purpose
