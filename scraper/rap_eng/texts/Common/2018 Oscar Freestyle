[Verse]
On Oscar night, this is the dream we tell
A land where Dreamers live and freedom dwells
Immigrants get the benefits
We put up monuments for the feminists
Tell the NRA they in God's way
And to the people of Parkland, we say "ashay"
Sentiments of love for the people
From Africa, Haiti to Puerto Rico
