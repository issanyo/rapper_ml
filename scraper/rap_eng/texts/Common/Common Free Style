Com sense - what can I do? I build or destroy
Doin' what I can, cuz ya see I be a D-boy
Takin' it to the future, I execute ya
If I have to, you can stand still like a statue
Wonderin', what's goin on? like Marvin
I start to carve in my own spot
My man Roy will make it hot
But we say it cold in the Go
The brother Common Sense never stop with the flow
My flow keeps goin' on and on and
I like to do it cuz ?
I'm not the type to beat like that
But when it comes to the empire, yo I strike back
Yo I like fat raps, I might be that type of sh*t
What can I do? I like to spit
On the graves of those who never been a slave
Don't understand about the things, they misbehave
When they see the brother com sense through the door
Ask about the dreds, they ask about the flow
They ask about different questions -
Questions like brother Questlove
This is what I do, I suggest love
To many, penny for your thoughts
Brother Com Sense yo I'm never takin' shorts
Ask too, I come through, just with my crew
With a little trees and a little bit of brew
But we can chill. I just came to feel
Brother James Poys on keys
What can I do, MCs they wanna freeze
When they see the brother common sense go against 'em
Yo we gotta system, we can break it down for Roy...
Hargrove...stars rove in the sky
I told you, I could say I'm from the Chi
But I'm from the Go
I keep it goin' and I never stop
Yo I'd like to do a show
Maybe the Vanguard and stand hard
With the brother right there on the horn
This is what I'm tellin' ya'll - my words are reborn
This is how it form: like an application
Playin' with yourself, boy, that's mental masturbation
This is what I'm doin' yo, I just passed the nation
This is what I'm askin' you, for an application
To come down. Com Sense got the sun sound
I run down different types of thoughts
It's like this is what I'm doin' cuz I just got divorced
Somebody just said he coulda seen me in the Source
A long time ago, an unsigned hype
I said Com Sense yo I been strikin' mics
Since I was a shorty, used to drink 40's
Now I'm drinkin shh types of water
And supportin' my daughter ya'll

My guy said it's like some 80's
This is for the ladies
Brothers go crazy
Check it out, I ain't lazy
With the style. com sense be from stony isle,
The only child of Ann brow
Hand down the thoughts
That's what she did a long time
Com sense came in with the strong rhyme
I like to say my name cuz' it's on my brain
What can I do, I ain't here to jest or entertain
I like to teach, if I gotta reach
Down from my brother from the window
Let the wind blow
From the brother com sense always mental
Roy said get up on this instrumental
The style so free, so I MC
Some call me com, some call me Rashid
Down with EB, you know how we do
Brother com sense ain't no neo soul crew
It's the other type of stuff
Yo I'm housin' you like the government but you ain't lovin' it
Somebody want a covenant, said cool we can make it
Com sense doin' the style is sorta sacred
