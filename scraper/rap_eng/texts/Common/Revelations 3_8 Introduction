[Common]
I woke up, this morning, thinking of you
And silence spoke to me, I was speakin' to you
Not diggin' the ways of the world, becoming deeper in you
Received gift of life like my little girl, now I'm breathin' for you
An unconditional love
Arms around me, giving spiritual hugs
Through the prophets, you sendin' your love
In it, I find salvation
From hearts and minds, it's sacred
Your kingdom is near, and I can taste it...
