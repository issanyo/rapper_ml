[Intro]
Come with it
(The only race on the planet is the human one)
Real talk
(Spread love)

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
We used to fight and fuss, we used to yell and cuss
We used to cock and bust now look at us
We done turned to ashes and dust to dust
I shoulda turned the cuz and returned the love
I shoulda passed the bud to all the bloods
And leave them slugs with them pigs in the mud
Who the fuck turned 2Pac into a thug?
All I used to get was a pound and a hug
I remember when we used to hate them drugs
Now we can't rap without being fucked up
High in the club but you sound like a drunk
Hard in the street but a jailhouse punk
Me and that nigga, yeah we used to bring the funk
Now we got love and respect like a monk
Understand that we got a lot in common
Homie you in the same boat that I'm in

[Hook]
I'm callin' all the real people (real people)
Let 'em know that the change gon' come
Tell me where the real people? (Real people)
It's time to wake up and stand as one
Callin' all the real people (real people)
You still got our faith nah we ain't none
Tell me where the real people out there
The real people out there

[Verse 2: Common]
It's a good day when it's me and O'Shea
It's like the times we cheered for O.J
I say "Mike", Cube say "Kobe"
But ain't no more beef, I put that on chief
Blaow, a little homie dead in the streets
It's like the day they compared us to meat
Glad Farrakan prepared us to meet
Now me and bro bringing meals to the meek
Think about my homie locked up like a Rasta
Dude in my ear askin' me about the Oscars
I build with the gods to show improvement
Hard to complain, real people goin' through it
I know the movement like I was Huey Newton
Can't explain why youngin's are shootin'
The revolution will not be on the 'Gram
The revolution is who I am, God damn

[Hook]
I'm callin' all the real people (real people)
Let 'em know that the change gon' come
Tell me where the real people? (Real people)
It's time to wake up and stand as one
Callin' all the real people (real people)
You still got our faith nah we ain't none
Tell me where the real people out there
The real people out there

[Outro]
I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
Be the change
