[Intro: Stacy Barthe]
Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

[Verse 1: Stacy Barthe]
You don't ever know, never know, never know when it's your time
Trying to predict the future's just a waste of time
Don't wake up one day and half your life has passed you by
Don't die, inside you're not dead yet, you're still alive, alive

[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]
All you can do is live for today and pray for another
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
All you can do is live for today and pray for another
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

[Verse 2: Stacy Barthe]
Fear's crippling, it's a man made thought put in our heads
Invading our thoughts, holding our dreams hostages
Take a walk out on this limb, and even if chances are slim
You won't die before you hit the ground, you fly, you gotta fly

[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]
All you can do is live for today and pray for another
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
All you can do is live for today and pray for another
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

[Verse 3: Common]
Sounds of tomorrow, borrow time for the day
Play in my head, I lay in the bed
Weighing what's said by the masses
They say we go from dust to ashes
Created from clay, on the way to being Cassius
I ask if, I gotta wait to be great
If so the weight is heavy, that's why I'm staying steady
On the grind, aligned with the will of the divine
I know the world is changing but I'm still in my mind
Where the peace be, days that greet me
I'm facing the east sea
We facing the beatly, daily and weekly
I pray that he keep me
Somewhere between the pimps and the priests
So the angels can reach me, tomorrow

[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]
All you can do is live for today and pray for another
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
All you can do is live for today and pray for another
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

[Outro: Stacy Barthe]
Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow
