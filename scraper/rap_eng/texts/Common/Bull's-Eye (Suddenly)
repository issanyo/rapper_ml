[Intro]
And If you've ever been in love I wanna hear you sing it as loud as you can, sing

[Hook]
Suddenly I'm not afraid to try and love someone
Suddenly I feel like now my heart can open up
And suddenly I'm thinkin' maybe you could be the one
Finally I think it might be right to fall in love
So fly on, fly high, come on Cupid hit a bulls-eye
Please don't let me down this time
I think I finally found that guy
So fly on, fly high, come on Cupid hit a bulls-eye
Please don't let me down this time
Cupid, I think I'm ready, ready to fall in love

[Verse 1]
I've been up and down so many times in love
And through it all, still I think I've never really known true love
But this time it could very well be a possibility
Finally, hopefully, you won't let me down this time

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
He could be the man of my eternity, but I don't know
If the future has him here with me, but I do know
That the way he makes me feel is so lovely
Mentally, Spiritually, he completes me, Cupid please come closer to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Common]
We should be able to love the way that warriors love
No fear, though we both went through pain like the story of thugs
And cold year was '03, you got to know you I got to know me
Now we can both go free
And fly higher that the Sears Tower
Everybody got baggage though we cleared ours
No more tear showers, I'm in your ear hours
Singing in unison with Luther Howard, love there's flower
And now it takes a lot for me to get aroused
Gotta be more that what's in them jeans and in the blouse
Queen, you're more than a face that's in a crowd
From Chicago so you know I'm tracing ya style
I stay in the clouds and love pure the way of a child
Maybe one day we'll be patient, the [?] saying our vows
Now Cupid's shooting, taking a bow
You never knew love, we making it now

[Hook]
