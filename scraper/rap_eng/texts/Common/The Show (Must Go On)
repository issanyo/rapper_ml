[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Uh
And Im still the one
Am I a poet or a prophet, or a stone to build upon
And what's the reason I still perform, feeding my children on
How I'm on a hustle from dusk till dawn
Where all the love and the trust is gone
My eyes wider than a baby that just was born
Fightin a war they ain't pay me enough to join
Behind a phrase they was crazy enough to coin
You kiddin me?
The pursuit of happiness, life, Liberty
And all type a necessities they not givin me
I put my body in jeopardy
Cuz im committed
Even though they try to stifle ya man creativity
They got hopes and plans a gettin rid of me
I hit em like ethiopia hit up Italy
Swift as the bullet that killed
King and Kennedy
You know the battle is on for infinity, now

[Verse 2: Common]
I remember the show
Like dougie
When people quiet was ugly
Yellin get money
Now the show done went dummy
Still doin shows where the spots be bummy
Roaches in the dressing room
I'm thinkin of a better room
Maybe the upper where my people won't suffer
The leather gets tougher we drive like a trucker
Thru the night
For every wrong makin 2 rights
And use mics to reach new heights, the blue lights
Follow
I guess it's the scent of Chicago
That make em wanna mess em up tomorrow
In these borrowed days
The rhyme and the mind that pays
The world is a show you define ya stage
1, 2
Its live so you can't undo
No sleep cuz then ya dreams won't come true
And everyone's like a broad that we run thru
Each venya
This ain't gon' stop so we just gon' continue

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
The Ernest Hemmingway of B-Boy poems
They can never take the pen away of LeRoi Jones
Pushin' a black Yukon gold in a new time zone
Diggin' on every nuance with two eyes closed
The life I chose is more of a mission
I make a crowd convulse and act on impulse and intuition
I've seen the future, listen, believe the superstition
I keep spittin' 'til it's a truce or crucifixion
Iâ€™m at home in the pressure zone, weakness is never shown
Let alone I'm a man made of mere flesh and bone
I can't help that my heart beat as a metronome
And I've acquired a taste that's upper echelon
Lyrical professional, maniac megalo
Plate in my head that spin the way the record go
And break it down like it's the walls of Jericho
If they don't know by know they prob'ly never know
