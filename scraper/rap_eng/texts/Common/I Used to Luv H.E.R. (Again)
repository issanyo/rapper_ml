[Intro]
Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and it don't stop
Well I (still love her)

[Verse 1]
I met this girl, when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school, when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic checking her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas, had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out and listen to her
Sitting on a bone, wishing that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
Because we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
She was fresh yo, when she was underground
Original, pure untampered and down sister
Boy I tell ya, I miss her

[Hook]
Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Well I (still love her)

[Verse 2]
Now periodically I would see
Old girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body but she started getting thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about, stopping the violence
About my people she was teaching me
Not preaching to me but speaking to me
In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approached
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
We met up, on the West coast, and that was cool
Cause I was in the streets smoking weed and ditching school
Picked up a bandanna, she started doing things another way
She got a lot of money in L.A
Late 80's economics had the West going wild
Circumstances forced her to change up her style
She said, afrocentricity, was good to have
But it wasn't representing what was popping on the ave
See, black people were still dancing like it was all good
She had to put it down for the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becoming well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just having fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell, by how her titties hung

[Hook]
Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Murs and 9th man, we gotta be the sure shot
Yes yes, y'all, and it don't stop
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and it don't stop
Well I (still love)

[Verse 3]
Now, I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
But once the man got to her he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now she's common in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs rocking jeans that's extra skinny
And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talking about popping bottles with models and all the strippers
Now she's a baller tryna see who's the richest
Had it all up with 808's and heartbreaks
Now she's too pretty to be digging in the crates
Stressing how wealthy and rich she is
She was richer in spirit, before she
Got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed, it's just so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same letting all these groupies do her
And make it rain on her, and try to auto-tune her
But I'mma take her back hoping that the shit'll stop
Cause who I'm talking bout y'all is hip-hop
I say she's just not the same letting all these groupies do her
And make it rain on her, and try to auto-tune her
But I'mma take her back hoping that the shit'll stop
Cause I (still love)

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Yes yes, yes, woo!
Murs and beefgal, beef and Mursgal
Murs and beefgal, in the house
I said the hot dogs, is extra crispy
The hot dogs, is extra crispy, the hot dogs, is extra crispy
And if you don't cook the shit on a grill, nigga miss me
