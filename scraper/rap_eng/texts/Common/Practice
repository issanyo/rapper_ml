[Intro: Samora Pinderhughes]
Looking out on my life, my sights, in the fast lane, it's a rat race
Give me time, give me time, changing pathways
Might takes some practice, it takes some practice
Might takes some practice

[Verse 1: Common]
My daddy said it was rainin, momma said it was snowin’
Heaven opened its door and warned us to Chica-go in
Life not knowin’ laughin’, learnin’, grownin’
The wind keeps blowin’, street sweepin’ and sowin’
Rollin' with my stolen moments, am I
Live and die, gettin' by, that’s the motion of Chi
Free and pain are identical, intervals of an inter-school
Lyricals what the spirit do, miracles when I interview
Myself, waitin’ for my soul to reply, no matter where I go the answer is why?
There goes the wind again, an envelope
A divine adrenaline and I’ma sin again
Forgiveness is a synonym for ‘live and live again’
The world need a DR like the Dominican
Republic, the subject is matter over mind
Life is a practice, a travelin’ in time

[Chorus: Samora Pinderhughes]
Might take some practive, takes some practice
Might take some practive
Looking out on my life, my sights
In the fast lane, it's a rat race
Give me time, give me time, changing pathways
Might takes some practice, it takes some practice
Might takes some practice

[Verse 2: Common]
Mountains sing songs, kinds dream long
In a simple act is when a scene forms
I improve to improve and involve the 'been throughs'
The 'near falls', the 'them fools', the 'brickwalls' and venues
Symbol of symbols to continue
It was written and God don't use pencils
Demented and [?] extensions of a man
Intentions of divine intervention in a plan
Remnants of when I ran footprints in the sand
The son of man gave me a tan, that’s who I am
The emphatical, radical, mathematical
Travel to capitals, in actual fact, extract practical
I seen pain to make the day cry, it takes practice somebody tell AI
Everyday I prey I stay my course, hopin' my actions obey my thoughts

[Chorus: Samora Pinderhughes]
Might take some practive, takes some practice
Might take some practive
Looking out on my life, my sights
In the fast lane, it's a rat race
Give me time, give me time
Changing pathways might takes some practice
It takes some practice, it takes some practice
