[Chorus 1: Snoh Aalegra]
I do bad things to good versions of me
I find good things in bad versions of me
I don’t know, it’s just versions of me, babe

[Chorus 2: Snoh Aalegra]
I’m in a nightmare having a dream
I got a question, am I who I seem?
I’m out the matrix from battlin’ me
I’m dipped in all black shadowing me

[Verse 1: Snoh Aalegra]
Something undefined is now taking over me
Who am I to fight me for my own soul?
I’m saying yes to things that usually are no for me
I kiss the neon night and let it have control

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge: Snoh Aalegra]
Why do I feel so free when I’m killin’ me?
I’m fallin’ to the sky caught between all the lines

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2: Snoh Aalegra]
I get so sad at myself
When I love what’s bad for my health
I wanna do right and I would
But wrong taste and feels so good

[Verse 3: Common]
Clutch the Dutch these feelin’s is hard to touch
Puff enough stuff, sometimes life is rough
On the cusp of doin’ right, who I’m foolin', right?
A child of the light goin’ wild for the night
Cause most of fights I have, yo I have with myself
A good dude, but I can do bad by myself
It's sad that I felt that I could never be
With nobody, girl you know my G
O.D. on the good life, I’m a man, it’s simple
Probably the things I been through and the evil that men do
I want my cake and eat it, heartbreak they take and leave it
The same song I’m bein’ featured, I can’t delete it
The good you can see it but you really a bad girl
Livin’ in a mad world, sometimes you want that girl
You ain’t been Madonna through the drama
If it’s comin’ back it’s karma, a queen is made to honor

[Chorus 1] + [Verse 2]
