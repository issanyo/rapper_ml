[Verse 1]
Everybody want a piece of the action bruh
It's a beast on the streets, no relaxing up
Trying to figure if it's heat or is it passion for
Do niggas want to eat or are we scavengers?
In the Jeep, two deep, I'm the passenger
Rolling with my guy to pick the package up
His main broad, he kept his stash with her
He trying not to look, she got an ass on her
Got out the truck, blasting BDP
These young bucks wasn't up
They barely heard of me
It's the Ickes where it's murder and debris
The nature of the place
To move birds and trees, the days felt strange (?)
Walked to the courts to watch the games (?)
Dappin' niggas up like Group Home
I'm saying to my man we gotta move on

[Hook]
Let's move
Yeah, we gotta move
Y'all niggas know we gotta move
Cause we paid dues
It's time to make moves

[Verse 2]
Trucked up ten flights of stairs, yo
Out of air, gasping for air, help
Down pissy hallways, that's their room
I'm saying this bitch better be there yo
Music loud out apartment ten oh four
With her nipples all hard just by open the door
Gave her a hug and said what up though
She said take your shoes off, just mopped the floor
She and D went to the back to handle the stack
Her uncle laid on the couch with a bottle of yak
Talking smack, smelling like crack
In less then a minute I heard a yell in the back
He said where the fuck is my money yo
The bitch came out the room running yo
Her uncle jumped up and reached for his chrome
I'm thinking on him, we might have to move on

[Outro]
We gotta move
Let's move
We gotta move
The state productions gonna move
