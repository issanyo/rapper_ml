[Intro: John Legend]
The wind against my face, tells me that I must go
Can't stay around too long before my tracks gonna catch me
When they do, I've got to be somewhere in LA
So I can look at the sun and get my thinking done
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain

[Verse 1: John Legend]
The last note I sang was in Beaver Falls, PA
At some old and shabby bar, I never knew the name
But I knew I could and work that  all on my dreams
They tell me find that place, find that place

[Hook: John Legend]
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Deep in my destination, trying to find my destination
With LA so far away and I'm soaking cold today
Constantly it's on my mind
I'm only halfway there, I'm not caring how much frustration
Oh, I've got to cross this nation

[Hook: John Legend]
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

[Verse 3: Common]
As the rain falls down from the heavens
Think of how far I came since '87
Took my hustle and made it a weapon
I was always told "in the pain there's a blessing"
Mistakes that I made, they mirrored the lessons
Talking with God, I asked clearer questions
Dear Lord, is this what I'm destined for?
If so? Then what am I stressing for?
We tight, then why can't I let it go?
Everything gon' be alright, it's more than a metaphor
Let it rain cause it's ancestral
Cleanse my heart so they can see the best in you
Let it rain and come down visceral
For those no longer here in the physical
Let it rain cause it's like tears from you
Just like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do
Let it rain, I know that it's purposeful
So that it can service you and return to you
Let it rain, let the rain surround me
And never drown me, I was lost when it found me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream, a dream is where I'll be

[Hook: John Legend]
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
