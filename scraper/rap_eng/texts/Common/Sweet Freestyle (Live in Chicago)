I can tell just by the way y'all dressed
It's just just so fresh
The brother Com Sense, yo, I been complex for a second
But I'mma just keep resurrecting
My people, my mic and your mic, no equal
Anyone that wanna go against Common Sense
I don't even think they got enough confidence
Cause I will never know, I got too much flow
And I will rock this mother.. from the go, hey
I be rocking from the go, don't let it go, hey
I be rocking from the go, don't let it go, hey
I be rocking from the go, don't let it go, uh
I be rocking from the go, hey

It's like this, y'all, I'm coming through
With a different type of view, I said check-a one two
The way that I style, the style'll be free
This is 28 Days, AT&T
And this is what I'm telling y'all as I watch ya
We heard a speech from Desiree Rogers
You know how it go, she do it for the people
She's Johnson & Johnson's CEO
That's just how it go, she's a woman
Got the people thinking bout the right things
That's coming in our heads
I'm coming off the head, never been misled
Just down for the black and the red
And the black people know that we need to grow
And let you people know, yo, we here to go
Windy City, Com Sense I never been phony
Hanging around Cottage Grove and snowy
And State Street, that's a great street
And let you know, some of these girls I had to meet
Back in the days, with them different type of flows
I used to see them girls when I was at Hero's
Or better yet, Shake Rick's
I could just flick Bics
And understand, yo, you could just get a quick flick
And let you know about these type of flows
I see the lady with the camera, so I pose..

It's like that y'all, yo, I be a singer
Yeah, earlier I messed up my finger
Hooping downtown; I got the round mound
I came down with that soul body pound
I was representing who? Um, Chi-town
Just the way we like to do it and get down
Lost and found, y'all know the sound
My man Main Venom, yo, he put it down
On the one and twos
Yo, we come from the Chi
Y'all can listen to him on GCI
Cause that's my guy, and I'm so fly
And we be down with my man Rob in the sky
You know Rob Kelly
The brother Com Sense checking now, you can't tell me
No type of story; I don't do this all y'all just for the glory
I do it so some people just know they can't ignore me
They can't ignore the blackness
Can't team up the jackness
I'm telling y'all, this is like Sounds of Blackness
So when it comes to this, yo, I don't be amazed
We gon' keep doing this for 28 days
And I'mma say love to all those that see
We rocking this for AT&T
