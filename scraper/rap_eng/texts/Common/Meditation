[Intro:]
I met a little boy, he asked me, "Where are we now?"
I met a little girl, she asked me if I was proud
Of what I had become and what the world would allow
I might put up a fight, but yet I'm still losing ground
If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears a sound
Did it really ever happen at all? Did it really ever happen at all?
I’ll tell you this: I put the work in daily, so it’s my belief, I can’t fall

[Verse: Common]
As we go into the well of the black pool of genius, August Greene
Time meets worth, rhyme beats birth of a new day, born again
Good mornin', these beginnings never form an end
Crowns of righteousness not to see the thorns again
I argue with my aura, am I born to win or born to sin?
Maybe both, contribute to daily growth, oath is taken like Liam Neeson
Somebody take my daughter, they gon' cease from breathin'
They body snatchin' black girls in DC
Politics and propaganda on the TV
Distractions, distractin' us from action
It's time for some, time for some passion
There's a time for patience, a time for communication
A time for formation, a time when it's overflow, and a time when it's wastin'
They say time's on our side like a hip replacement
This shine that I wear is from them times in the basement
A time to rebuild, a time to be ill, a time to be still, a time that we heal
On the mountain top, the youth from the fountain drop
Thoughts about being forever young, it's like a deacon never ever sung
With the choir, this is praise and worship, everyday’s a circus
I walked the tight rope, tryna find a way to work it
Yeshua paid for our sins, that's the greatest purchase
To keep it 100, we made imperfect
What I strive for is what I live for
Studied the lessons, now the lesson is to give more
And endure trials with style like Johnnie Cochran
I rap with a gift that can't be boxed in, winnin' is the doctrine
Starin' time in the face, I guess that I'm a watchman
My father created time, yes I'ma watch him
Locked in, tryna get out of a sunken place
A blackness that ain't defined by time and space
