[Chorus: Lianne La Havas]
I'll go through the fire
I'll go through the fire for you
It don't even matter
What it requires
I'll go through the fire for you

[Verse 1: Common]
It started with [?] our Father
More than ever, I need you now, Father
Fear don't live far away
Them yesteryears ain't where they are today
Who gon' be the saints of the modern day
Mistakes are tuition that we gotta pay
From whom much is taken, much is cherished
Lord deliver us, hoping that we get the message

[Chorus: Lianne La Havas]
This diamond is just a stone
This building is just for show
A wonderful piece of paper
That put me atop the throne
Going through tribulations
This hunger won't let me go
This hunger won't let me go
This hunger won't let me go
Seeing so many faces
That do or die by the cold
I'll go through the fire
I'll go through the fire for you
It don't even matter
What it requires
I'll go through the fire for you

[Verse 2: Common]
In search of golden wings and a chariot
If Jesus died on the cross, why I gotta carry it?
I know the struggle is our heritage
Certain pieces of pain can't be parented
Don't wanna fall in the same place my parents did
The sins of the Father inherited
Sometimes I feel my life is an experiment
I'm driven but God's wheel is steering it
I focus on the road heavy as my eyelids
In a world where power is parallel to violence
It won't change if we remain in silence
See it through, look inside for the guidance
Humanity is where the honor and the pride is
For those who can't no more, tears I'ma cry [?]
Now I decipher who my tribe is
And live a life to know what the other side is

[Chorus: Lianne La Havas]
This diamond is just a stone
This building is just for show
A wonderful piece of paper
That put me atop the throne
Going through tribulations
This hunger won't let me go
This hunger won't let me go
This hunger won't let me go
Seeing so many faces
That do or die by the cold
I'll go through the fire
I'll go through the fire for you
It don't even matter
What it requires
I'll go through the fire for you
