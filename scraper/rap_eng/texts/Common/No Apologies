[Chorus: Common]
Follow, follow, follow, follow me
I be living out a prophecy, ayy
Living, no apologies, living, no apologies
Follow, follow, follow, follow me
I be living out a prophecy, ayy
Living, no apologies, living, no apologies

Follow, follow, follow, follow me
I be living out a prophecy, ayy
Living, no apologies, living, no apologies

[Verse 1: Common]
Government tried to swallow me, wish we had our own colony
Black space odyssey, we land on property
I'm an anomaly to the economy, get dollars, we chase policy
[?], watch Am√©lie, unapologetic, no stopping me philosophy
A man, I wasn't told how to be, in some ways, hip-hop fathered me
Pops said anything is possibly, "Inshallah," that's the Islam in me
Pardon me, my artery is martyry, go hard to free those in poverty
Peace is a part of me, revolved in me, involved in me, I'm God to be

[Chorus: Common]
Follow, follow, follow, follow me
I be living out a prophecy, ayy
Living, no apologies, living, no apologies
Follow, follow, follow, follow me
I be living out a prophecy, ayy
Living, no apologies, living, no apologies
Follow, follow, follow, follow me
I be living out a prophecy, ayy
Living, no apologies, living, no apologies

[Verse 2: Common]
Meta-, meta-, metaphysical, reppin' is a ritual
School days, I'm the principal, still wannabes and jiggaboos
Light-skin, field nigga dues, don't question me, no interviews
It's gonna take a miracle to change the block and that's spiritual
Tactics for black kids, it's mind over matter, where blacks is
It's captive where the trap is, the ghetto is radioactive
The struggle's attractive, made moves and backslid
So I could back, give, [?] back to Jackson
See blacks were [?], blacks in fashion, in fact the [?]
Now it was style, it was loud, it was proud
Endowed by the clout of the people's profile
Reach out, speak now, we down, feet down on the ground where it's cold
Facetime, bass lines, grace fines, great minds intertwined on the road

[Chorus: Common]
Follow, follow, follow, follow me
I be living out a prophecy, ayy
Living, no apologies, living, no apologies
Follow, follow, follow, follow me
I be living out a prophecy, ayy
Living, no apologies, living, no apologies
Follow, follow, follow, follow me
I be living out a prophecy, ayy
Living, no apologies, living, no apologies
