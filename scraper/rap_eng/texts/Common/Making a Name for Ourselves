[Intro: Canibus]
Yeah, yeah, me and my man Common Sense
Rallying troops like Joseph Stalin
Where you at, yo?

[Hook: Common and Canibus]
I'm about to make the name Common Sense a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And I'm a make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"

[Verse 1: Common]
I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken-hearted bitch, don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got and I get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I'm creating the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Putting together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time
So you niggas need to stop testing me
Because you know you can't "F" with me, stepping to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposing yourself to the verbal radiations
Saying you can defeat me is nothing but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggas be digging my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
Who wanna battle? I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun, but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MC's will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch
What?

[Scratching]
"Stepping to me is like going to the county being a neutron"
"I ain't scared of no nigga"

[Verse 3: Common]
I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles, rhyming big words and not saying shit
The clique that you came in with accent your flavor with
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced than a rapper whose career
You could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble it's
Mistaken as a weakness, when poetry's in motion
Like a picture, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions

[Scratching]
"Fucking with Canibus"
"Fucking with Canibus"
"Fucking with Canibus"
"Fucking with Canibus"
"Yo, sick with it"

[Verse 4: Canibus]
Yo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral
With three-hundred sixty degree visual
When the signal was given, MC's get bitten
With venom from a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source, it belongs on the Shroud of Turin for certain
I grab mics and murder shit
It's wickeder than Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this, the lyrical verbalist slash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into "The Artist Formerly Known As"
You gay-ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So fat to be a rap star, taking pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me
Up in The Source chilling on page forty
Put this in your CD-ROM
WWW-dot-Canibus-dot-com
You can find me on the internet talking to chicks
That was sweating me off the "Music Makes Me High" remix
I be talking mad trash, trying to get 'em to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
Beasts from the East part two, coming to see you

[Hook: Common and Canibus]
It's time I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"
Since I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And since I made the name Canibus a name you fear
Stay scared, I'm still your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"
