[Chorus]
The rains are falling, [?]
I had a run, some close calls
I lost and played the game, I lost and played the game
Been lost for many days, feel like I'm stuck in place
Let me fly, let me fly

[Verse 1: Common]
This is the story of the king and I
Or yet a black bird who always had a dream to fly
It's like everyday will prey on this bird so he keep it knee to sky
And weed to high, thinking he defy the gravity of love
Killing him softly, the tragedy of love
There had to be a dove that was out there for him
He be madly in love and then go to boredom
His own issues, he would ignore 'em
And pour 'em into work and being so called free
Now imagine this bird being me
I always thought, "I'm the one to fly free"
Played the game and handled it like Kyrie
Looking past my exes like I'm YZ
Not thinking, "Why me?" 'cause she cry me a river
I'm thinking bigger, looking for the perfect picture
Takes much practice, I was in love with an actress, a singer, and a tennis player
Star Wars of love, every princess had a Leia
'Don't commit' city, you could say I was the mayor
Am I built for relationships and marriages?
Questions I had for my aunt and a therapist
Checking in and out of Heartbreak Hotel, man
Bag lady, I'm the bellman

[Chorus]
The rains are falling, [?]
I had a run, some close calls
I lost and played the game, I lost and played the game
Been lost for many days, feel like I'm stuck in place
Let me fly, let me fly
