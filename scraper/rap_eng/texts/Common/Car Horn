[Hook]
I'm the C O double M O to the N
You heard, motherfucker? Well boy hear me again
Official raw nigga from the City of Winds
Straight doing it, doing it, I am doing it
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 1]
What the fuck is going down? Nigga you sound
Like a real bitch right now, the pound
I gave you I knew I shouldn't have gave you
Before you was a ho now you think the money made you
A slave to the rhythm, indentured servant of wisdom
Clinton is the pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm
In a poetical prison, I'm visiting self
For hours, coward niggas get shanked for kicking
Pussy raps, radio is like CO's they try to push me back
I rip cats out of they suits, give them they hoodies back
I'm from the hood we stack, black fist
"Ooh ohh ahh" is the sound of blackness
These new school cats is classless, influenced by rap shit
Front money, but hustle backwards
I break bread with broads that got they masters and hypes the blaster
Lawyers that work faster and young ghetto bastards
Became childlike with the way I style right
And act, because children naturally react
Respond to the Com as a poet I'm a last like a Don
Cause I'm like that yo, a phenom without shit on my arm
You can't coherse a verse
I'm a rhyme when I want to get up and rhyme
Some say I'm spaced like John Glenn cause of the places I've been
I embrace the vibe, spin, been through cases of Heinekin
Return to orbit on some shit that's anti-corporate in a Wild Style
Orchard gay rappers is getting tortured for tossing salads
You imbalanced, you rap about violence too much
I go on blind dates with mind states and go dutch
At my shows the law show up, they be thinking it's a hold up
So many hands go up, but with the band I'm colder
Money folder, you want a fresh style let me show you

[Hook]
