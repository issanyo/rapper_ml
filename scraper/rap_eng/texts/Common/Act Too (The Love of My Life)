[Verse 1: Black Thought]
The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
Into the deep cosmos
The impact pushed back, the first five rows
But before the raw live shows
I remember I's a little snot-nosed
Rocking Cazal goggles and Izod clothes
Learning the ropes of ghetto survival
Peeping out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back, my front, plus my sides too
When it came to getting mine I ain't trying, to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you
Hip-hop, you the love of my life and that's true
When I was handling the shit I had to do
It was all for you, from the door for you
Speak through you, getting paper on tour for you
From the start, Thought was down by law for you
Used to hit up every corner store wall for you
We ripped shit and kept it hardcore for you
I remember late nights, steady rocking the mic
Hip-hop you the love of my life
So tell the people like that y'all
And it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We bout to take it to the top

[Verse 2: Common]
I was speaking, to my guy 'Riq and
How she was desperately seeking to Organize in a Konfusion
Using no protection, told H.E.R. on Resurrection
Caught up in the Hype Williams, and lost H.E.R. direction
Getting ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H.E.R
An under the counter love, so silently I treat H.E.R
Her Daddy'll beat H.E.R., eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape, niggas had her in the buff
When we touch, it was more than just a fuck
The Police
In H.E.R. I found peace
Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, tricking off
Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Movin weight, losing weight
Not picky with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty
Most of the niggas she know is dirty
Having more babies than Lauryn
She started showing early
As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testing me
In retrospect I see she brought life and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and White dudes
Over H.E.R. I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life, making the right moves
Besides God and family, you my life's jewel
Like that y'all
