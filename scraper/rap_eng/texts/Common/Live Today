Transitions

Transitions of a man's mission
Can turn the moment, into something he owns
Not just for him, but for them
To understand, this is peace of a man
Woman beside providing balance
So that we can do our best, with God's talents

Yeah (x6)

[Hook]
Live today (x8)
Don't give it away
It away (x3)
Cause we live today
We live today (x3)

Today I'm known, today I'm born
New ways I'm going, new ways I'm growing
New ways I'm flowing
A form unknown from the corner is one stone
Coloring life with more than one tone
Nation embracing life's placements
Faces in places we in, the direction it's taking us in
Like the wind from a city that's discovered by DuSable
Chicago taught me how to lead and to follow
My heart, even when it's hollow
I plant a seed for today that believes in tomorrow
Sun telling me never feed in the sorrow
Pay attention, cause these times are borrowed
Days is a maze, Is a lesson, it's a maze
It's a blessing it's a blessing we live today

[Hook]

Life everlasting
Passion is extreme from dreams that we have
The path that we take
The path that we make
We create from the one true
Yo, Some things we gotta undo, and unlearn
Taking turn to earn
Taking turn to burn
Taking things is firm
Firm in the mind and rewind them
[?]
We divide them out, divide them in
The way common sense and my man D. Hodge blend
We take it in like a breath
I can be the chef in the kitchen
While I'm switching
Up a different type of style
I'm a different child
I gotta think faster
Got a task for
Everybody
Just to do
Just to live today
Just to live today

We live today for the present known and it's a blessing
For our future
Giving thanks, for our ancestors in the past
Forgiveness for the transgressors
Cause we dance with the ancestors
