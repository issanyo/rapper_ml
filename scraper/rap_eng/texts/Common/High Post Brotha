[Verse 1: Jill Scott]
Everybody wants the hero, who just wants the man?
Who fights with his devils and does the best he can
Everybody wants a playa, I just wanna be friends
Every, everybody wants a superstar
Who got cars and ice, walks into the ghetto get pussy bar
Makes all the girls look think twice
Yeah, sista he got money and thangs but is he nice for you

[Chorus]
He's a high post brotha with money in his pocket
He got everything a girl could want, think maybe he don't
High post brotha with money in his pocket
He got everything a girl could want, think maybe he don't

[Verse 2: Jill Scott]
Some sistas want the balla
But mentally can he really play ball
Dumbfounded by out the ghetto conversations
His mentality's oh, so so small
Get the cream, get the hoes
Get the cars, he wants to go far
But how far is too far

[Verse 3: Common - rapping]
Come here love, chicka love, let me holla at you
'Cause what you got is worth more than a dollar or two
Soil another nigga's game usually I wouldn't do
But you my girl and I can tell that its bothering you
This mother (uh) must think that he a father to you
You got vision but boys blockin' the view
I know he payin' yo tuition
Payin' to get the car fixin'
He got juice or is he pulp fiction
Heard he be strip clubs
Trickin' 'dubs like he got big pub
Is it his image or him that you in love with
You on some shit but you was never superficial (I ain't superficial)
When rent's due is trip what a chick do
You don't like his mind the way he looks
And you said that his breath stinks
But all of that added up
Doesn't equal a fresh mink
Let's think who you are
You the moon baby so fuck the superstar

[Chorus]
'Cause he's a high post brotha, money in his pocket
He got everything a girl could want, I think maybe he don't
High post brotha, money in his pocket
He got everything a girl could want, I think maybe he don't

Maybe he don't
I think maybe he don't
Maybe he don't
I think maybe he don't
I think maybe he don't (2x)

I think maybe he don't
I think maybe he don't
I think maybe he don't

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
[Jill Scott scatting]
I think maybe he don't
I think maybe he don't
