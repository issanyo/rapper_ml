{Chorus}
How'd you really get that life
It's going, it's going
How'd you really get that life
It's going, it's going
How'd you really get that life
It's going, it's going
How'd you really get that life

{Verse 1}
How'd you really get that life
Remember when we used to watch nick at nite
Saying everything was gonna be alright
But then you started selling rocks and smoke at night
Man
Let me feel alive for a minute
Go back a few years, then my world starts spinning
We never went to church, so i had no limits
Tryna make the best of me with what i was given
I was so alone in my room
Wishing help was on it's way soon
Baby
I was five feet below
I was underneath the water
Underneath the undertow
The days start skipping now
How ya living?
Tryna find my way, tryna learn to start forgiving
Every other day, a day that i was missing
Every night alone, it's only useless wishes

{Chorus}
It's going, it's going
How'd you really get that life
It's going, it's going
How'd you really get that life
It's going, it's going
How'd you really get that life
It's going, it's going
How'd you really get that life

{Verse 2}
Everything you taught me
Everything you wanted
Everything you did without me
Everything you said
Stuck in my memory, even though its faded
I still see it cleverly
If you do it right the first time you won't get it wrong
You're my only son, ima sing it like a song
You will grow up and be humble
Always take care of your mom
If you're feeling down
Always stay strong
I don't really know what i'm doing
Passing time, living in the music baby
I've been here for a minute
Tryna live my life but there is no winning
Tired of being lonely and i feel like quitting
Your life is a gift, but life isn't perfect
Life isn't gifted, life can be surfaced
When we get together
(We can get through this)
We can get through this

{Chorus}
It's going, it's going
How'd you really get that life
It's going, it's going
How'd you really get that life
It's going, it's going
How'd you really get that life
It's going, it's going
