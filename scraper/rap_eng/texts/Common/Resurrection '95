[Intro]
Yeah I'mma get this one off for Eighty-Seven Street
South side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere check it
It's like c'mon y'all, get live get down
Common Sense is in your town
I said c'mon y'all, get live get down
Common sense is in your town

[Verse 1]
I stagger in the gatherin' possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin'
Over the global, my vocals be travellin'
Unravellin' my abdomen, it's slime that's babblin'
Grammatics that are masculine
I grab them in, verbally badgerin' broads
I wish that Madelyne, was back on Video LP
Raps I make up like blacks do excuses
I feel like Noah, hookin' my mellows up on deuces
If a broad ain't got a mind, a job or crib, she useless
Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines
They say signs of the end is near
I wonder can I walk a righteous path holdin a beer
Got more verses than a Kramer, go off like a pager
Skills uglier than Craig Mack in your ear, I'm the flavor
My old bird said some of my songs sound like noise
Don't watch the Bulls as much (Why?)
They got too many white boys
A million black men walkin' towards one direction
For sure, the cream of the planets... resurrection

[Verse 2]
A prophet, raised among black disciples and Vice Lords
Who don't give a fuck about mic cords and nice swords
Get up, together black wrists get cuffed
I'm wishin' for a change, my man want his change in a cup
Yessir, I'm in the Mix-a-Lot
Bitches put 'em on the glass while I'm puttin' stickers on they ass
I rule everythin' around me like cash
On the rocks of reality, dreams get splashed
In jams, I mash like Alan Alda
Niggas nod, they say "Hey" as if I was Little Walter
87 strip walker, taught the code of the area
By stayin', within the barrier
Exposed to stony stimuli, with that I identify
Brothers went through my rotate solidify the realness
Skull-caps, Smurfs, Puffy jacket, Luggz boots on
Steppin' to me is like goin' to the County being a Neutron

[Verse 3]
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike
When in dim light, I use insight to enlight
Then write somethin' that's skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe
Imagination's in flight, I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights, I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
I've been indited as a freak of all trades
Doodoo-Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo, I got it made
I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums, hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruisin' Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
87 got my back and we don't get no thicker
Chicago got my back and we don't... now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga
Ain't scared of no nigga
But it's my turn to go I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm
