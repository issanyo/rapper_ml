[Verse]
I met a little boy, he asked, "Where are we now?"
I met a little girl she asked if I was proud
Of what I had become and what the world would allow
I might put a fight but yet in still I'm losing ground
If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears a sound
Did it ever really happen at all? Did it ever really happen at all?
