[Verse One: Ed O.G.]
Ayo you hesitant it's evident
I'm the bomb you the Bush like the president
Represent Massachusetts residents
Abuse rap kids, ain't no evidence of negligence
Ever since
I use the mic to make better sense
I control the stage since the golden age
A whole part of the book
You a half a page
Cut short like half a days
I rip motherfuckas half my age
Boston's only undisputed
We aiming at each other, who's gon' be the first to shoot it?
Love the game so much
That it hurts me not to do it
We can fight for our people that's been persecuted
Get these weeds uprooted
For me it's about overlook
For you it would be a better beat and a fresher hook
I got a second wind, a fresher look
Ain't no telling what's gonna happen when the pressure cook
You look lost need direction
It's years of skills and perfection
It's Ed OG and the Boulevard Connection

[Scratch Hook]
"It ain't nothing but"
"Hip hop"
"Coming through, coming through"
"Competition"
"Bring it on"
"The Boulevard"
"Produced a real rap song"
"It ain't nothing but"
"Hip hop"
"You know what I'm saying?"
"Competition"
"Bring it on"
"The Boulevard"
"Produced a real rap song"

[Verse Two: Masta Ace]
Aside from a few of y'all I don't feel nobody
I got more skill in my finger than you got in your whole body
Best in the whole party?
I don't know, probably
It's my prerogative to flow oddly
But I'm no Bobby
But this a New Edition to the truest mission
Save them little rap verses, all you gotta do is listen
To be truly flavor, do me a favor
Get a new flow, a new voice and a new behavior
You 'bout to set the game back with them lame raps
It's sickening like Hammer when he danced for chicken
In the darkest times
My shine is way past florescent
My flow's the future
Connecting the past to the present
You won't ever see my feet in no Gators
Meat and potatoes
Hip hop is like the Broncos, beating the Raiders
It's a blood war
From the studio to the tour
You not in it for the love, what you doing it for?
You can get fucked up over biting
Like a thumb sucker you dumb fucker
Kiss ass rappers can come pucker
I ball like I'm from Rucker
When you was writing your first rhyme
I was getting my swerve on like a drunk trucker
Hip hop's in my blood, it runs through my veins and into my heart
It pumps out in the form of art
It's the strong ones killing the weaker
And at the same time, it's that sound that's filling the speaker
C'mon

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Common]
Boy in my ear with his breath all booty
Asking why my beats ain't hard and why I ain't in movies
Nigga
I did a flick with ya girl
We made a record and let it spin in the world
My inner world ain't that difficult
I mostly do what real niggas do
Rituals of brew drinking
And new thinking
In pursuit of Abraham, as I pursue Lincolns
Town cars come and scoop me
I try to be humble with groupies
You as square as a cigarette
Smoked so many rappers that they gave me packs of Nicorette
Indigenous to hip hop
B-Boy native
Don't really listen to rap, I try to stay creative
They say, "Com, don't be coming on that space shit."
This is basement
In a way you never tasted
It's the Boulevard

[Hook]

[Scratching]
"Thinking of all the kids that try to do this for all the wrong reasons"
"You not in it for the love, what you doing it for?"
'Claiming Respect #2'
"Crap rappers, biting them rhymes"
??
"One thing I hate is a bitin MC"
"You gotta have style and let it be original"
"Like this"
"There's a sign at the door, no biting allowed"
