[Verse 1: Erykah Badu & Common]
Everyone hides their faces
Behind a mask they wear
Jimi was a rock star
Searching for that magic place
That he could touch in the sky
Just to get his people high

[Verse 2: Erykah Badu & Common]
Life is so colorful
Reds, blues and dreams
Jimi lives in a purple haze
In a psychedelic maze
Playing the streets like an instrument
Pulling strings wherever he went
Angel sent from the sky
Just to get his people high

[Bridge: Erykah Badu & Common]
Women all around
Fast cars and sound
And freedom he was bound
Couldn't see the ground
Jimi, come out why don't you set me free? (set me free)

[Verse 3: Erykah Badu & Common]
So high, born to fly
Getting high off his own supply
With the most highs of the sky
Everybody follows the same lord
Choosing his light to guide the way
You do, but who do you choose?
Some try things but few die so young
Something among Jimi was stung
Everyone hides their faces
Behind a mask they wear

[Outro: Erykah Badu]
(Jimi, come out why don't you set me free?)
[Repeat until fade out]
