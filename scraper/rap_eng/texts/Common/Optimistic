[Chorus: Brandy]
You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

[Verse 1: Brandy]
When in the midst of sorrow
You can't see up when looking down
A brighter day tomorrow will bring
Hey yeah, yeah
You hear the voice of reason
Telling you this cannot weigh me down
No matter how hard reality seems
Just hold on to your dreams, yeah

[Chorus: Brandy]
Don't give up and don't give in
Although it seems you never win
You will always pass the test
As long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

[Verse 2: Brandy]
If things around you crumble
No, you don't have to stumble and fall
Keep pushing on and don't you look back
Oh, feel
I know the storms and strife
Cloud up your outlook on life
Just think ahead and you'll be inspired
To reach higher and higher

[Chorus: Brandy]
You'll always do your best
If you learn to never say never
You maybe down, but you're not out
And that's where I will lift you up
Don't give up and don't give in
Although it seems you never win
You will always pass the test
As long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

[Verse 3: Common]
Living in the moment, who's the opponent? I own it
Get it when I want it, composition of the golden
Enrolled in school of life, threw the dice through it like
(Eyes on the prize)
Living in ambition on a mission impossible
Envision optimism through a prism that's optical
To see through obstacles and be remarkable
(Eyes on the prize)
Living it for the infinite, intuit of the intimate
Influenced by the sentiment, sent to it to win in it
Surrendered it to the sky, sent to them my eye
(Eyes on the prize)
Living in the glory and the story of a warrior
Victory of the more we love, from how poor we was to euphoria
Kick in the door because we think notorious
(Eyes on the prize)

[Chorus: Brandy]
You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
(Be optimistic) You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
(Be optimistic) You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
(Be optimistic) You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
(Be optimistic) You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
(Be optimistic) You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
(Be optimistic) You can win
As long as you keep your head to the sky
(Be optimistic) You can win
(As long as you keep your head to the sky)
(You can win)
(As long as you keep your head to the sky)
