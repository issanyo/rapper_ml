[Hook: John Legend]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, They say...)
They don't knowwwww

[Verse 1: Common]
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick, "Tell Cara get us a show"
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yea, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Consequence]
See my life was kinda simple like Nicole and Paris
'Til i started making dollars like I rolled with Paris
Then we went our seperate ways like annulling a marriage
Cause they talk behind my back even worse than the past
Cause while i tried to make it happen they preferred an excuse
And that rubbed me the wrong way like a pervert masseuse
Cause nothing free about juice when you go to the market
So how you using mine just to corner the market
Now I'm more of a target than the items in Target
And matter fact homie I'm tired of talkin'
So if you got them killers what you need to do is send one
Otherwise start calling me Ben cause i been one
Cause 'Quence getting stung ain't in this package deal
So I'm screening all my calls like the actors deal
And since [?] in the hood is even higher than Dre Day
I could give a damn about the things that they say
