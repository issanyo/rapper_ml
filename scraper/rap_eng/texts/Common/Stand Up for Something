[Verse 1: Andra Day]
You can have all the money in your hands
All the possessions anyone can ever have
But it's all worthless treasure, true worth is only measured
Not by what you got, but what you got in your heart
You can have, you can have everything
But what does it, what does it mean?

[Chorus: Andra Day]
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
You can't just talk the talk
You got to walk that walk, yes you do
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
And I stand up for you
And I stand up for you, yes I will, yes I will

[Verse 2: Andra Day]
You do the best that, do the best that you can do
Then you can look in the mirror
Proud of who's looking back at you
Define the life you're living
Not by what you take or what you're givin'
And if you bet on love there's no way you'll ever lose
Take a stand, make a stand for what's right
It's always worth, always worth the fight

[Chorus: Andra Day]
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
You can't just talk the talk
You got to walk that walk, yes you do
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
And I stand up for you
Self respect, dignity
If that's all you got, then you got all you need
And without that, you don't have a thing, oh, no, no

[Verse 3: Common]
Rise up, love, lift your hands
I stand with you 'cause I understand
Ain't here to judge, just to take a stand
The greater plan's the Creator's plan
Let's all rise like the day began
Reach out and touch with the Savior's hand
On rock, we stand like this native land
Let the ways of love be the ways of man

[Chorus: Andra Day]
And it all means nothing
If you don't stand for something
You can't just talk the talk
You got to walk that walk, yes you do
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
And I stand up for you (stand up, stand for you)
I stand up for you (stand up)
And I stand up for you (stand up, stand for you)
Stand up for you, yes I will, yes I will (stand up)
