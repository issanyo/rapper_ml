[Chorus: Common]
90 in the red
This is how I'm going to work it
90 in the red
This is how I interpret
90 in the red
Throughout the inner city circuit
90 in the red
R-red, r-red, check it

[Rap: Common]
I see most on they way to service
I put my lyrics for the leap
But now they got vertical like Levertis
[?]
I make moves using head first
He [?]
I will be here for mega-ever
The letter of intent to
[?] Liquor University
It's up to me whether it'll bring the best or worst of me
Emergency
Niggas got nines and mack 1-1s
The sandwich he will unsung [?]
Heard if you run from law, it's a felony
Collect this melody
More bills they're mailing
Steadily
I'm selling the fake tags
While rhyme bags at [?] for cash
I bolt the Diamante with no gas
Blast upon the rap scene
With more script than Quentin Tarantino
Off the old script I'm a chip
Be at the riverboat casino
Chicken I'll scratch
While them old ladies be winning
This the 87th inning
Watch my crew stretch

[Chorus] (2x)
