I feel rugged, I am rugged, damn rugged
I walk on the carpet of the universe
Keep on

And speak on shit most are scared or unprepared
But I fled for my people
So keep on

Beyond space I look for a place to put hurt
I gotta work
Keep on

Dreams of Black roads, of Black souls that act holistic
It's realistic
Keep on

Pharoah of the sun looking down the barrel of a gun
Y’all know where I’m from
Keep on

Niggas at the crib saying Rash look weird
From myself I never hid
Keep on

Niggas at the crib say for them I never did
30 year old kids, shit boy
Keep on

Any means necessarian, vegetarian
I be missin' chicken
Keep on

Request for another Resurrection
The way I rhyme before progression
This ain’t ’94
Keep on

Chat room geeks critique my B-Boy physique
Who the fuck made you Hip Hop police?
Keep on

Journalist who never had their turn at this
If it's fresh, who are you to determine this, groupie?
Keep on

You here to show truth or expose your cooch?
You know I know reek from the roots
Girl, keep on

Disease man made to reproduce, we afraid
A cure, magic got AIDS
Keep on

Supporting two homes paying back school loans
Like the NBA I’m in a new zone
Keep on

Got married and you carry the weight it take to not get your freak on
Keep on

Fuck shrooms and ecstasy
I’m consumed with a recipe
To get my blood to the highest destiny
Keep on

The blackest of rappers, I ain’t doing no namin'
Go to Europe and start O’Jayin'
Keep on

Whether chopping the raw or studying for the bar
We all children of Allah
Keep on

Flyer say Free Mumia on my freezer
I’m holding still mixing Echinacea and Golden Seal
Keep on

Is it just an illusion?
It’s many levels to it
It’s rebel music
So keep on
