[Chorus 1: Colbie Caillat]
I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I wanna be your favorite song
La, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1: Common]
We on our way back, we on the play back
We on some new plus old, never change that
We on the new tip, G.O.O.D. music
We see the pen and the paper, we gonna use it
It takes some late nights to get them bright lights
We keep rockin' them songs to live that good life
I do it for you, I do it for me
We break it down, Colbie, tell them the story

[Verse 2: Colbie Caillat]
Listen, can you hear me?
Am I coming in on your frequency?
I got a story
Subject of the plot; you and me
And when you're sleeping, and when you're waking
And when you're feeling good
I'll be the thing that, you wanna sing back
Stuck in your head like I knew you would

[Chorus 1: Colbie Caillat]
I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I wanna be your favorite song
La, la, la, la, la

[Chorus 2: Colbie Caillat & (Common)]
I wanna be your melody
Flowing through your head when you think of me
I wanna be your favorite song
La la la la la
You'll be singing like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Turn it up)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Turn it up)
You'll be singing like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: Colbie Caillat]
Baby, can you feel me?
I'm the kick drum that gets your heart to beat
I gotta have you near me
You can count me into every song I sing

[Verse 4: Colbie Caillat]
And when you're sleeping, and when you're waking
And when you're feeling good
I'll be the one that you want to comeback
Stuck in your head like I knew I would

[Verse 5: Common]
We on our way back, we on the play back
We on some new plus old, never change that
We on our way back, we on a play back
Play back, play back, p-p-p-playback

[Chorus 1: Colbie Caillat]
I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I wanna be your favorite song
La, la, la, la, la

[Chorus 2: Colbie Caillat & (Common)]
I wanna be your melody (Yeah)
Flowing through your head when you think of me
I wanna be your favorite song
La la la la la
You'll be singing like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Turn it up)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Turn it up, turn it up)
You'll be singing like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Turn it up)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 6: Common]
Girl, the songs you sing
They my favorite things
You stay in my dreams
Something supreme, uh
Love is the key, and it's made your life, see
Common and Colbie, I'm dusting off the old me
Like the OLB, we call 'em oldies
In your melodies, I'm hearing things you never told me
We stay in tune with each other
In our room, we'll discover new ways to do covers
No matter how they dub us
We should stay true to the trust
And the winner of the best duo is us, uh

[Chorus 1: Colbie Caillat]
I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I want to be your favorite song
La, la, la, la, la

[Chorus 2: Colbie Caillat & (Common)]
I wanna be your melody
Flowing through your head when you think of me
I wanna be your favorite song
La la la la la
You'll be singing like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Turn it up)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Turn it up, turn it up)
You'll be singing like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Turn it up, turn it up, ya'll)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro: Colbie Caillat]
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is
I just wanna sing it to you everyday
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is
La, la, la, la, la
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is
I just wanna sing it to you everyday
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is
La, la, la, la, la
