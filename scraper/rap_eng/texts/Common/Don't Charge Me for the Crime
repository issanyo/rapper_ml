[Intro: Common]
This is life in this world
Some things go right
Some things go wrong
It's just how the world can be
People just want to be free
Yeah

[Verse 1: Common]
The verdict came in and it said I was guilty
I looked at the judge, "Hey, America built me"
Tried to get rich but they label me filthy
Only God can judge me, touch me, feel me

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
My friend calls me at nine o'clock
Says, "Get the car, it's time to rock"
Never heard him speak this way
I grab the keys and hit the road
It's all a flash but who would know
How the story would unfold

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Common]
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime

[Verse 3: Nick Jonas]
My friend gets in the car with bags
Filled to the top with loads of cash
And throws his pistol on the dash
Says, "I'm sorry for the crime
That I've involved you in this time
You're the only friend I've got"

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Common]
So don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime

[Verse 4: Joe Jonas]
I start to freak and scream so loud
Just like the females in the crowd
That's when he gets in my head
You could live just like a king with everything
You'd ever need
All the dreams of every man

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Common]
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time, uh, yeah
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time, you know, uh
Don't charge me

[Verse 5: Common]
Siren sound and my heart was pounding
I looked at my man as the cops surround him
A teen on the scene with no objective
The American dream can be so deceptive

[Verse 6: Nick Jonas]
Now, I see the flashing lights
There goes my future and my life
Now, I've gotta do what's right
I stop the car and throw the keys
Out of the window sets me free
I throw the pistol in the back
Throws me out of the car
You know me well
I'm not going to jail
I'm not paying your bail
Believe me when I say

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas and Common]
They won't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the
Crime
