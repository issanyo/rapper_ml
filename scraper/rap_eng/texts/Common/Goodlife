[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell]
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I was born into poverty raised in the sewage
Streets will always would be a part of me, they made me the truest
And even when my days wasn't the bluest
I never ran from adversity, instead I ran to it
Fear ain't in the heart of me, I learned "just do it"
You get courage from your fears right after you go through it
Now I come through in a Coupe on 22's
That ain't bad for a nigga who ain't even finish school
Don't get me wrong I ain't never been a fool
I just put off graduating for a pair of tennis shoes
I used to use the beats to paint my pain
But nowadays man I can't complain
I got several automobiles and they all on them thangs
Several solitaires and they all in one chain
They used to see me in the mall, I'm the same
And gettin brains from a couple of broads on the plane

[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell]
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 2: Common]
I come from Chi-Town lost and found in the struggle
Where dudes say "stay safe" and "say out of trouble"
Speakers muffled, the law and BMs try to cuff you
Those with duffles move weight and have muscle
I dug through the dirt with a verse for the people
Open up for Daddy Kane and Eazy at the Regal
The radio rarely put their needle on my record
They ain't see how the hood and heaven were connected
Sounds projected, ain't show how effective
Lessons learned, sessions turned to life reflected
And everything I found real in life, yo I kept it
They say life's a teacher, you're gonna get tested
When a nigga changed they kept saying "that nigga strange"
They couldn't see how my mind on bigger things
Ahead of my time now I caught up with the game
Making good music, making paper, making change
And it's good

[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell]
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Gasoline drawers, I stood in the fire
With enough heat to set the hood on fire
Man you niggas think Suge was off the wire
You should've seen the squad before I had Messiah
We assumed the title as the number one supplier
Felt like I was selling blow since I was in diapers
And we wish a nigga would come try us
We was cool with the killers, best friends with the lifers
Quick to up and scrap if a nigga wanna to deny
For what we considered then a lucrative empire
But like that pimping time flash by you
Now I wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors
'Cause prisons ain't full and the reaper ain't bias
Anybody telling ya different's a damn liar
Gave the jail hell and shot birds at the hearse
Lived through worse and reversed the curse

[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell]
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
