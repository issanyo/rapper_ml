[Intro]
"I met this girl when I was ten years old"
I had a dream, a dream since I was a kid

[Verse 1]
I'm moving, yes I'm moving on, the motor turning over
I met her when I was 10 as I began to grow older
Exposed to the culture, culture that would change me
With the mic check I paint a picture like Banksy
Concrete rose going through hoes and blows
On a paper chase, I found out I was chose
A fetish for clothes, success, and blessing the hood
The struggles of an MC progressing through the good
Music for the 90s, 2000s, and beyond
It started with me wanting niggas to say me could rhyme
And now it's my time, then now it's forever
Change the world, raps and styles getting better
Revolutionize and rising above the game again
My career is fading in, like a DJ on a blend
Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics
This is hip-hop y'all, we driving for the spirit

[Outro]
No I.D. is in the house
Twilight Tone he's in the house
J. Period is in the house
Kanye, he's in the house
G.O.O.D. Music, we in the house
J. Dilla, he's in the house
Yo, The Roots they in the house
Kristen Mills is in the house

I had a dream, a dream since I was a kid

"They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me"
"I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul"
