[Verse 1: Gregory Porter]
Can you see strength in my eyes?
I used to sleep through the night
Then horror  came;
There were no lights, no sirens, just guns;
It was violent
And we had to run or die

[Chorus: Gregory Porter]
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running

[Verse 2: Gregory Porter]
So much time wasted in tents;
Seventeen years inside a fence;
I ran from the war, homeless, no school, no future;
I’m a ghost, but not finished, I will rise!

[Pre Chorus: Gregory Porter]
Say, ooh, are we all alone?
Say, no, I’ll never forget my home

[Chorus: Gregory Porter]
Running from the place that I know
I’m running, what direction should I go?
I’m running, so tired and so worn;
I won’t stop until I’m safe and strong

[Verse 3: Common]
Where I'm running to is running through my mind;
Always on the run; am I running out of time?
Darkness in my way; I pray that the sun will shine
Started from the bottom and that was underlined
By the place that I'm from; sometimes is un­divine;
I hear them songs of freedom, and they running through my mind;
Close my eyes; imagine a place next to me;
Where I no longer can be labeled a refugee
Destiny, oh, somewhere down these dark roads;
Yeah, we the lost tribe but we found our souls
Cold rain, all pain, I left along the way;
I fight through the night, just to find a stronger day

[Chorus: Gregory Porter]
Running from the place that I know
I’m running, what direction should I go?
Keep running, so tired and so worn;
I won’t stop until I’m safe and strong

[Bridge: Gregory Porter]
Oooo
Had to flee the place you love;
Oooo
Tough as nails when things got rough;
Oooo
Many fathers told their sons and daughters;
Say oooo
Don’t stop running ‘till you’re home!
Say oooo, Refugee song
Say oooo, Refugee song
Say oooo, Refugee song
Say oooo, Refugee song
