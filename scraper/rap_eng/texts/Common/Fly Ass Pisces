[Verse 1]
I met you in a dream on a nude beach
You threw up peace, you said "Peace, that's a nice ride"
I compliment your wings and your fish tail
Don't know how this bitch found jeans in the right size
I open up my eyes, there's a dream come true on my right side
Waking up to you, damn that's a nice high!

[Bridge]
If you wanna fly and go deep
Then let's go now
If you wanna fly and go deep
Then I'm your style

[Chorus: Jhen√© Aiko]
I think you need somebody like me
Something like a fly ass Pisces
Someone who will never let you go
I know

[Verse 2]
I met you on the beach, with some blue dream
Forever seems too short, not enough time
But you're taller than me when you sit down
Don't know how this fish found jeans in the right size
I look up with my guys
The home girls are ten's, looking on fire
Nothing left to do
Flash to the right side

[Bridge & Chorus]

[Verse 3: Common]
I'm like a fish out of water when it come to order
A good woman, I support her if it's in her aura
She was a fisherman's daughter, that's how I caught her
I ain't the one to judge so I court her
Like right for my lifeline, companion of a lifetime
The moon that make my light shine, she shine then I shine
Fly Pisces moving up the river though
Moves was really pivotal, thinking like a nigga though
She could make the money flip, oh
One some Gabby Douglas shit; gold
Ain't worried bout no other chick, no
She know she like the mothership
Connection, it was destined
Gave her protection, she gave reflection
Sexing is a ritual, so unconventional
Miss was like mystical, pieces of a Pisces original

[Chorus]
