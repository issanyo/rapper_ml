[Spoken Words]
My favorite game to play as a kid was hide and seek
And looking back, I understand why
I wasn’t, so much a big fan of tag or cops & robbers
But something about hiding, in anticipation of being found, was kind of like the most exciting thing to me as a child
It’s almost like I wanted to get caught, wanted to be found
*Clears throat*
I was always a shy kid
It’s like I had an imaginary mask that I always hid behind
It gave me a sense of comfort
And now being, you know, “grown” that mask has took on like so many new personalities
And at this point, uh, you know, I'm kinda done with the masquerade and-
I feel like it’s time to take that mask off
