[Intro]
Hennessy all on your breath
I need a little less love, more sweat
I like it intense
Hennessy all on your breath
I need a little less love, more sweat
I like it intense

[Chorus]
Hennessy all on your breath
I need a little less love, more sweat
I like it intense
Like we're fucked up, but tonight it made sense
Tomorrow I'mma be past tense
Tomorrow I'mma be past tense
T-T-Tomorrow I'mma be…

[Verse 1]
Got a little money, I ain't got no game
Got a couple songs, I ain't got no fame
I should probably quit maybe sell cocaine
Cause a nigga still ashamed sitting on a train
You deserve a coupé, you deserve Jimmy Choos
High expectations, that's what the city do
You can blame it on me and I'mma blame it on you
Like it when we argue, cause I'mma put it on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Like, take that
Let's not waste time that we'll never make back
Got a good heart, I'mma prolly break that
You belong to the city, I ain't tryna change that
Nah, take that
Let's not waste time that we'll never make back
Got a good heart, I'mma prolly break that
You belong to the city, I ain't tryna change that

[Chorus]
Hennessy all on your breath
I need a little less love, more sweat
I like it intense
Like we're fucked up, but tonight it made sense
Tomorrow I'mma be past tense
Tomorrow I'mma be past tense
T-T-Tomorrow I'mma be…

[Verse 2]
I could put you in a rap, never could write you a poem
You expecting roses but I rose on top the totem
Never met your expectations, now you holdin' on the past
I'm holding on the money, while I'm holding on your ass
Never been too sentimental – that's detrimental to women
I'm more experimental, like
Let's invite another woman for tonight
See how it goes for the night
I don't miss hoes, I miss flights
I been doing wrong tryna find Ms. Right
And if she righting wrongs then I'm right on time
Gimme a sign - middle finger in the sky, that's sign language
In my mind I'm like fuck it
Caught in your sleep, might wanna tuck it
Ain't afraid of death
Life is but a test
Love is overrated but I'll say it for the sex
Ain't afraid of death
Life is but a test
Love is overrated but I'll say it for the sex

[Chorus]
Hennessy all on your breath
I need a little less love, more sweat
I like it intense
Like we're fucked up, but tonight it made sense
Tomorrow I'mma be past tense
Tomorrow I'mma be past tense
T-T-Tomorrow I'mma be…
