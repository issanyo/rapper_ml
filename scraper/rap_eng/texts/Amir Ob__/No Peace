[Hook]
Where your love now?
Pour my heart out to the floors now
Treatin' love like a drug, I been drugged out
Treat your feelings like a target, bring them guns out
Kept on shooting just to prove that you ain't numb now

[Verse 1]
Put a ring on a middle finger, fuck you
Hope it stings just a little when it cuts through
Kept it distant from them women that be tellin' now
All them stories you ain't told, you can tell 'em now
I don't get enough credit
'Less we scamming understand we get enough credit
I make it work either way 'till the peace stop
I'm seeing all my enemies throw the peace sign, no peace

[Bridge]
Let them bodies hit the floor now
Let them bodies hit the floor now, now, now, now, now
Let them bodies hit the floor now

[Hook]
Where your love now?
Pour my heart out to the floors now
Treatin' love like a drug, I been drugged out
Treat your feelings like a target, bring them guns out
Kept on shooting just to prove that you ain't numb now
Where your love now?
Pour my heart out to the floors now
Treatin' love like a drug, I been drugged out
Treat your feelings like a target, bring them guns out
Kept on shooting just to prove that you ain't numb...

[Verse 2]
Where your love now?
In the bottom of this bottle, I go drunk now
If I'm sober, then it's over, say it's done now
Won't play it smarter, I'm a martyr I go dumb now
I'm still open i'm just hoping you ain't shut down
I can see your soul when I'm looking in your eye
Tryna feel alive but you're killin' all the vibe, yeah
Found a treasure, girl you mix the truth with the lies, yeah
I done told you, but you never even threw a sign, yeah

[Bridge]
Let the bodies hit the floor now
Let the bodies hit the floor now, now, now, now, now
Let the bodies hit the floor now, now, now, now, now
