[Hook]
Won't find love in the hills
Won't find love in the valley
Had a one night thing
Found love parked up in an alley
One night, one night thing
I had a one night thing, one night thing
Had a one night thing with a girl, Calabasas
Had a one night thing with a girl, Calabasas
I had a one night thing, one night thing
I had a one night thing, one night thing

[Verse 1]
Still hitting licks though , re-ed up on an off day
Got you feeling like the plug now, that's what they all say
I ain't never needed help, off the backboard to myself
Hit you niggas with a windmill, fuck the Jaguar, I got the belt
I'm way up, waved up, took another addy just to stay up
Don't listen to anything they say, yuh
Tell me all them stories that you made up
Pretty women singing trash songs
Put these bitches in my sad songs
Yeah, I knew it wouldn't last long, never last long, no, no

[Hook]
Won't find love in the hills
Won't find love in the valley
Had a one night thing
Found love parked up in an alley
One night, one night thing
I had a one night thing, one night thing
Had a one night thing with a girl, Calabasas
Had a one night thing with a girl, Calabasas
I had a one night thing, one night thing
I had a one night thing, one night thing

[Verse 2]
Rich girl, ratchet, that's the new wave
Caught you slipping in the mix for like two days
Rich girl, ratchet, that's the new wave
Caught you slipping in the mix for like two days
Bout to hit you with the facts
Probably cheated more than I was faithful
If you ain't know then it's you're bad
Bad bitches only can taste it
Take your time, take your time
These niggas still think when we together
No chance, I'll erase your mind
You looking salty, you sending texts
You like, boy, why didn't you call me?
Take it away, take it away, man at this stage
(Talk your shit, talk your shit, oh)
She don't wanna waste no time
She just wanna waste my time

[Hook]
Won't find love in the hills
Won't find love in the valley
Had a one night thing
Found love parked up in an alley
One night, one night thing
I had a one night thing, one night thing
Had a one night thing with a girl,Calabasas
Had a one night thing with a girl, Calabasas
I had a one night thing, one night thing
I had a one night thing, one night thing
