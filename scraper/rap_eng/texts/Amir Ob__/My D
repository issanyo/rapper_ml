[Verse 1]
Me and my neighbors
Stackin' that paper
Three words for haters (what?)
Fuck you and later (ha)
Room full of models
Girl this ain't a show
White girl with the white nostril
Line up, sniff, sniff, sniff and achoo
Do it for my city and dogs till I
Die to see God the fire feast on
My so so cold in the deep let the Devil know he never bothered me
New God energy
Like a prophet, in a mosh pit, like a pocket full of profit from talking shit
Finna have the whole world on my dick
Blessed blessed gorgeous plus I'm paid
Used to used to ride the 2 train now it's two-door and a chain, I–I ain't got a backseat but a taxi do the same
So give yo girl a Adde and then she gave me brain
Slept on nigga get gone
Old rappers lookin' so thirty, bad enough to try just young
Ghetto kid I'm gonna play dirty

[Pre-Hook]
La-la-la last night I swear I met an angel
She asked me what I was mixed with, I said "gorgeous and gangsta"
"Gorgeous and gangsta
Gorgeous and gangsta
Gorgeous and gangsta"

[Hook]
Yeah, uh, I'mma have the whole world on my d (yeah)
Whole world on my d

The whole world on my d

The whole world on my d

[Verse 2]
Spanish girls call me "papí muy lotto"
Exotic mamí on my Ducatti in Cabo
Get yo bread up, bitch I'm the man
Fuck they head up when I rock Timbs in the sand
Reppin the D, put on for BK
Lookin like dolla signs don't forget P.A.C.K. (no)
D-long and GQ
With some white girls in see-through
Li-lingerie sip chardonnay
Call me daddy cause father paid
Ay, but he wanna be a king till I fuck they queen and piss on they castle
Finna ball and I ain't got no one a pastal
Start to realise what to castal
Illiminate friends that wear the Gucci
Mixed wit Marigela dont rock the Gucci
Instead of Gucci
It's like the nights are long, it's like everywhere I'm goin I'm just finding a clone (bitch)
It's a new classic move trap and a new passion
You fake flyin you never knew fashion
You late we don't do that shit bum-mastic bitch

[Pre-Hook]
La-la-la last night I swear I met an angel
She asked me what I was mixed with, I said "gorgeous and gangsta"
