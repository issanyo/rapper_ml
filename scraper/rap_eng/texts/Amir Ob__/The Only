[Verse 1]
Met you ‘round the way up
There’s some things that I ain’t said yeah
There's sometimes I wished you stayed yeah
Miss you every single day I
Think about you when I drink alone
Pop a pill and call you on the phone
That’s that over thinking when I’m home
Losing focus when I’m all alone

[Chorus]
You don’t love yourself
You don’t trust yourself
You not the only one
You not the only one, yeah
You don’t love yourself
You don’t trust yourself
You not the only one
You not the only one, yeah
You don’t love yourself
You don’t trust yourself
You not the only one
You not the only one, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know fights and I know pain
Got a cup full of that purple rain
Only way that I can turn the page
Hope these lyrics find you on the way
Out your way is what you want, right?
Drunk in Texas, been a long night
If she gone I can tell y’all
How I know how you felt, nah
You don’t know, nah

[Chorus]
You don’t love yourself
You don’t trust yourself
You not the only one
You not the only one, yeah
You don’t love yourself
You don’t trust yourself
You not the only one
You not the only one, yeah
You don’t love yourself
You don’t trust yourself
You not the only one
You not the only one, yeah

[Outro]
No, no, no
No, no, no
Yeah, no
No
