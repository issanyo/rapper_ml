[Verse 1]
Aye, think I need to slow down
Need to put the phone down
It's a shame babe
'Cause it'll hurt you if I felt the same way
I'm no competition if we're playin' games
Thinkin' you and I want the same thing, no
Sittin' right beside you
I've been livin' with a liar
And it'll make two if I promise
Never go play around fire

[Pre-Chrorus]
Last night I had a dream you was drunk with me
Confessing that you might be in love with me
The pain always come with your company

[Chrorus]
I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake
Holy shit, I'm awake, holy shit, holy shit, ayy
Why you actin' holy? You ain't this, yeah
Why you actin' holy? You ain't this
I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake
Holy shit, I'm awake, holy shit, holy shit, ayy
Why you actin' holy? You ain't this, yeah
Why you actin' holy? You ain't this


[Verse 2]
Yeah, Heartbreak Hotel now
Room 911 I'm in Hell now
Closest thing to heaven when she comes through
Lookin' like an angel, let me love you
Think I need to slow down
Need to put the phone down, ayy
Ayy, think I need to slow down
Need to put the phone down, ayy

[Pre-Chrorus]
Last night I had a dream you was drunk with me
Confessing that you might be in love with me
The pain always come with your company

[Chrorus]
I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake
Holy shit, I'm awake, holy shit, holy shit, ayy
Why you actin' holy? You ain't this, yeah
Why you actin' holy? You ain't this
I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake
Holy shit, I'm awake, holy shit, holy shit, ayy
Why you actin' holy? You ain't this, yeah
Why you actin' holy? You ain't this
