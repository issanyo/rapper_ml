[Intro: Sample from T-Baby – It's So Cold in The D]
It's so cold in the D!
How the fuck do we 'sposed to keep peace?
It's so cold in the D!
How the fuck do we 'sposed to keep peace?
In the D!
In the D!
In the D!
In the D!

[Verse 1]
I feel trouble brewin, I’m losing my manners
Pooh got the hammer, just came home from Atlanta
Used to diss his dreads and his accent
We passing through the east side robbing bitches for they glasses
Cartier when they goin' get paid, well damn how we gon' split the profit
We prolly get some bank for them
Six-six-sixhundred that's good enough, do it up at Fairlane Mall
Took some ghetto broads to the store
Circle the movies for hours, after hours
It's still live, posted by a Benz like it's ours
Thomas had a Corolla, nicknamed it Rolly
My Rollie, nicknamed Corona, it's stolen
Corona was 18 carat
Oh so, I thought til it turned copper, oh now I'm embarrassed
Fuck it though we at the club 18 and under
First day of summer we leaving or what

[Hook]
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god

[Verse 2]
Uh, five deep in Corolla, smoking weed, sipping soda
Pray mom don't smell the odor
Them bum ass Nikes got boring, cop Guccis at Nordstroms
Mom asked me how you afford them
Uh, Early introduced me to Sean, he was on, signed to Kan
I'm kinda jealous, shout out to Sean
Chopped it up in his Impala, gave me tickets to his concert, came home promoted my songs
Fuck it, let's go stir up some beef
In the burbs disturbing peace, blasting music burning trees Worthless pieces of shit, gripped a G in a week
Copped Louis V
Some matching belt came next weekend, hit Fairlane Mall the same evening
C-C-Carties on
Niggas drove by bumping Blades, ice was on
Ran up on me, caught me slipping it hit me dead in the jaw
I'm sleepin
Woke up, Carties missing, Louis missing, sidekick missing
Lost sight of vision, left eye was dripping

[Hook]
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god
Swear to god, I'mma die rich, swear to god

[Outro]
'Nother day, 'nother dollar
'Nother day, 'nother dollar
'Nother day, 'nother dollar
'Nother day, 'nother dollar
