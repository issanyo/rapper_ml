[Verse 1]
You
If I ever thought I had a queen I’m straight face bluffin' I promise (promise)
Told me I’m nothing well, Ima make something out of nothing, I promise (promise)
You told me I’m not your type of guy and I’m way too shy, I promise (promise)
Back before we even had a fight yeah you did it out of spite, I promise
My mama said, “Miro you're a genius” and I’m starting to believe it, I promise (promise)
They don’t really feel me unless they really in their feelings, I feel it, I promise (promise)

[Bridge]
Mmm mmm, I can't tell no lie, I promise (promise)
Broken heart to broken promises

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to them yellow lights I'm never gon' crash
I'm addicted to them yellow lights we never gon' crash
I'm addicted to yellow lights we never gon' crash
I'm addicted to you

[Verse 2]
Used to be scared of the chase, now you say I'm brave, I promise (promise)
Only place I could ever spill my pain all day, I promise (promise)
You told me I'm not the type of guy and I'm way too shy, I promise (promise)
And my ex in the crowd, point her out, Ima ask her how she doin', I promise (promise)
Got that little pretty ring now, I promise (promise)
Hit me kind of heavy, but I'm way more steady, already I promise (promise)

[Bridge]
Mmm mmm, mmmmm
I promise
Broken hearts to broken promises

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to them yellow lights I'm never gon' crash
I'm addicted to them yellow lights we never gon' crash
I'm addicted to yellow lights we never gon' crash
I'm addicted to you
