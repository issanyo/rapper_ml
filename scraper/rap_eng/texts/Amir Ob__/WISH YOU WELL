[Chorus]
Know your place yeah, know your place yeah
I got licks to hit like right now, I'm impatient
I got women on the cell, trying to give me hell, yeah
I still wish a nigga would, I still wish 'em well yeah

[Verse 1]
Yup, pour my problems in a red cup
Only check-up when the cheques come
My pockets looking blessed up
All that talking never stressed up
They talking like they jealous of me
They talking like they never loved me
They talking like they next up
I still treat 'em like a stepson

[Pre-Chorus]
Champagne showers on the way
I've been working twenty-five hours every day
Pull up with the 'bands, have 'em dancing in the rain
Pull up with the 'bands, have 'em dancing in the rain

[Chorus]
Know your place yeah, know your place yeah
I got licks to hit like right now, I'm impatient
I got women on the cell, trying to give me hell, yeah
I still wish a nigga would, I still wish 'em well yeah
Know your place yeah, know your place yeah
I got licks to hit like right now, I'm impatient
I got women on the cell, trying to give me hell, yeah
I still wish a nigga would, I still wish 'em well yeah

[Verse 2]
Promises and wishes, candles for my exes now
Ain't no fingers left to count my blessings now
Promises and wishes, trust me it's been different now
No rings for the 'tings, I go missing now
Promises and wishes, why would I ever stop celebrating?
Why would I ever stop celebrating?
I'm naming all the hearts I've been breaking
I'm naming all the hearts I've been breaking

[Pre-Chorus]
Champagne showers on the way
I've been working twenty-five hours every day
Pull up with the 'bands, have 'em dancing in the rain
Pull up with the 'bands, have 'em dancing in the rain

[Chorus]
Know your place yeah, know your place yeah
I got licks to hit like right now, I'm impatient
I got women on the cell, trying to give me hell, yeah
I still wish a nigga would, I still wish 'em well yeah
Know your place yeah, know your place yeah
I got licks to hit like right now, I'm impatient
I got women on the cell, trying to give me hell, yeah
I still wish a nigga would, I still wish 'em well yeah
