[Chorus]
Lost my mind, thousand times
It's just you, tryna find
Lost inside, lost in time
Lost my love, lost my mind

[Verse]
Tryna find some songs to relate to
Tryna find excuses to hate you
Ain't no makeup out here gonna make you
And ain't no break-up with me gonna break you
Heartless, at times I feel a darkness
Sometimes I think you want this
You got this, you got this
Just don't ignore the signs
You can stop this, tho

[Chorus]
Lost my mind, thousand times
It's just you, tryna find
Lost inside, lost in time
Lost my love, lost my mind

[Verse 2]
Bitch, that's your personality
Ay, wear it so naturally
You a bitch, that's your personality
Ay, wear it so naturally
I'm just an audio clip with some truth
My lyrics on the side o' yo wrist tattoo
I ain't in The Loop, but they keep me on loop babe
You don't understand, this is all about you babe
Aye, I miss conversations in the silence
When we don't speak it speaks volumes
Now you're livin' in the silence
And I been livin' in your eyelids

[Chorus]
Lost my mind, thousand times
It's just you, tryna find
Lost inside, lost in time
Lost my love, lost my mind

[Bridge]
Bitch, that's your personality
Ay, wear it so naturally
You a bitch, that's your personality
Ay, wear it so naturally
You a bitch, that's your personality
Ay, wear it so naturally
You a bitch, that's your personality
Ay, wear it so naturally
You aâ€“

[Chorus]
Lost my mind, thousand times
It's just you, tryna find
Lost inside, lost in time
Lost my love, lost my mind
Lost my mind, thousand times
It's just you, tryna find
Lost inside, lost in time
Lost my love, lost my mind
