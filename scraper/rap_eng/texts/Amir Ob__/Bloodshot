[Verse 1]
Alcohol makes the convo easy
We don't speak but they lowkey need me
Used to curve now they wanna come see me
I ain’t never found a hand that feeds me
Call Stwo up, yeah I need soul in it
Mike Blud in the cut hold my phone
I'ma send texts, say the Jameson did it
Tryna cut a check but I need more in it
I couldn't afford a coach bag for her
She wanted a Kors and I’d hustle for it
Now it's lonely me in a two-door drop
'lone but I love it, what's love anyway?
1k, 2k, 100k, made 5 - milli' on the way
Money never really made me happy anyway
More satisfied to see the look on they face
I been seein' smiles I could tell they all fake
I been seein' styles switch since I been made
I just found new vice needa be saved
I been up 5 days numbing my pain
Clearing my mind, Like The Sun for the rain
Losing my mind, just tryna stay sane, oh
I ain't never been sane
Dealin’ with the things I can’t explain
Like how she been side she ain't ever been main
Like why she ain’t mine, why she ain't...

[Chorus]
Acting like I'm sober but my eyes bloodshot
I don't want the convo when I’m high, don't talk
I know it ain't the truth when the eyes don't lock
She been throwing stones when I used to be her rock
Never lonely I'm just lowkey
Pull up now they acting like they know me (you don't know, you don't know)

[Verse 2]
Backwoods on the wood grain, hood way
Bunch of bad bitches, mean it in a good way
I don't like the way that you move (I don't like the way that you)
Friends turning frauds ain't cool
I can't even tell who's who
Nah don't lie, speak truth (I don't lie, speak truth)
Cutting bitches off with the proof
Acting brand new (brand new)
Paid dues now it's overdue (it's overdue now)
Things wishing she could undo (things wishing she could undo)
We don't speak no more but my name tattoo'd
I ain't being petty but I know it's too soon

[Chorus]
Acting like I'm sober but my eyes bloodshot
I don't want the convo when I'm high, don't talk
I know it ain't the truth when the eyes don't lock
She been throwing stones when I used to be her rock
Never lonely I'm just lowkey
Pull up now they acting like they know me (you don't know, you don't know)
I don't want the convo when I'm high, don't talk
I know it ain't the truth when the eyes don't lock
She been throwing stones when I used to be her rock
Never lonely I'm just lowkey
Pull up now they acting like they know me (you don't know, you don't know)
