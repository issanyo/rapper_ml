[Verse 1]
Me, myself and I
Hennesy and Black & Milds
Everything I've seen as a fucked up child
Still repeats in my fucked up mind
Could've been deceased awaiting trial
Could've stole the keys, but I chose hot-wire
Now I'm rolling' through the hood, windows down
Avoiding cop cars, stop signs fucking up my breaks
Growing up fast, like fuck the wait
Escalade truck press play on game
Turn that bitch up and swerve both lanes
Crash, that motherfucker in a fence
Ever since had a phobia of driving
"Paranoid", I said in silence, uh
Whiplash, [?] had crashed a whip that ain't mine
Pull the speakers out, all I heard was a baseline
O god, heard cops at the same time
Airbags out, both stuck
All bad, never felt luck
Got out, [?] the way
Play it off on my pen today
Gotta find a payphone cause I'm out of minutes
I'll call Thomas, maybe he's around chillin'
Told me he got bitches on the craft
I told him I'm on joy rollin', police is on my ass
Twenty minutes later, in Corolla chillin'
[?] Cola, bag of chips
Nigga I just crashed a whip
Dodged a charge, Dodge Charger
It was killa, that's my cousin
He was stuntin', husslin', heavy headed charger in the Chevy my nigga
"The fuck is up tho, how you've been
Where the hoes at, where the dro at?
This's our city, yeah cos you know that"
Only cash is on our mind
Smoke some weed and grab a 9
Hope we graduate on time
Cause I hate school
Don't need y'all
Whatchu gonna teach me, I'm too smart
Free fall to the motherfucking money
Detroit, ain't a damn thing sunny
Funny how we got these dreams that rich folks tell us we could archieve
