[Verse 1]
It started when my baby didn't need me
I punched my fist through the TV
Put it in my shirt to stop the bleeding
And walked to the train lookin’ evil
I hopped the gate, I don't got change for it
I got anger issues, I'mma pay for it
Love’s only what you get to take for it
And if you ain't patient, don't wait for it

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life tryna be somebody
(All my life tryna be somebody)
All my life tryna be somebody

[Chorus]
Momma, I don't wanna be famous
I just wanna go home
You know I don't ever feel shame but
I'm ashamed, take me home
I'll do better, I promise
I'll do better, I promise
I’ll do better, I promise
Just for you

[Verse 2]
It started with a cigarette and whiskey
Escalated when she ain’t miss me
I got a good feeling I'm replaced now
Yeah, I’m drinking straight, I don't chase now
Depression got me picking up the pace now
They won't see me take it to the face now
I mix it with the smoke for the balance
Admitting all this my biggest challenge

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life trynna be somebody
(All my life trynna be somebody)
All my life trynna be somebody

[Chorus]
Momma, I don't wanna be famous
I just wanna go home
You know I don’t ever feel shame but
I am ashamed, take me home
I'll do better I promise
I'll do better I promise
I'll do better I promise
Just for you

[Outro]
Momma, I don't wanna be famous
You know I don't ever feel shame but
I am ashamed, take me home
I'll do better, I promise
I'll do better, I promise
I'll do better, I promise
Just for you
