[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Fuck around and get rich fucking with OVO
Might get another Rollie, might get another bracelet
24 carat
RIP Mikel and Abdullah
93's whassup?

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good
I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Questions like, "Can you get Drake's number?" Nope, no way, Jose
Rolling out, every time the Hummer pull out, remember slowly in the slow lane
Police still watchin' the boy now cause I ain't no boy now, I'm the man
Tings I gotta understand, my girl wanna see a plan
House, and a Porsche to drive in
We just need some keys just to put them inside it
The crib look like a temple, man we livin' in silence
We juugin' so silently, the money is silent
True, say the girls do adore us
Who do we all do it for?
Hey, sorry for the wait, amen
All I need's a little more room for me
And it'll be straight
I'm at Petro gassin' up, tell that boy his pass is up
Cut the cheque, quit checkin' up, I'm okay

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good
I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good

[Verse 2: Amir Obe]
Don't say you've been hittin' me up
Don't say you've been callin', brand new foreign, it just picked me up
All that talkin', you say I ain't down for you
A nigga like me ain't got no time for girl like you
No apologies, I hold a grudge
Dealin' with the comma, broken hearted women try fix me up
I ain't with the swindle, smokin' out the window
I don't pass the blunt, no no
Sorrows in the cup, girl I used to fuck with you 'til I realized who I was
No way, 45 nights on the low
45 nights in a row, true say
You adjusted to the road
You get the packet, you live through pics and the captions
You talk a lot just to say that you have it
Back now, we fuck with no passion
And if they keep askin', I say I'm good

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good
I'm good, I'm good, I'll always be good
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
