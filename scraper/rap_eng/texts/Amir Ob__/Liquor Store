[Verse 1]
We too sick to fool a smile
Corey had us thinking juvenile
We a team, maybe you should try
To grow some balls you little pussy
It's do or die
Now move aside let's finds a come up
And get this dough
Run up in the store and shoot the ceiling
And empty the drawer
Give me the mask, I'll hold the bag
Corey get the cash, Pooh watch the door
Jay got the gun, just don't let it go
Unless you need to
And after we'll make a run for the school
Find a place to duck the tool
Split up if we need too but don't let nobody see you
I'm ready, you ready?
Hold it steady, take it off safety
It's basically halo, just pull the trigger when I say so
New pesos just a bullet away
Make the stores open
Walk to the door and blew it away
Warning shots hit the ceiling, confetti fall in slow motion
And both the clerks went to kneeling
Heard shotguns fire too, Jay hit the floor
His brains hit aisle two
