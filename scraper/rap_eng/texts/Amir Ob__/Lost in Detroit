[Intro: Doe Wright]
And we lost

[Hook: Doe Wright]
And we lost in the D, in the D
Double cup, double cup
We ain't scared of police
Got a line for the dough
Line for the freaks
Got a line for the dough
Got a line for the...
And we lost in the D, in the D
Double cup, double cup
We ain't scared of police
Got a li-li-line for the dough
Line for the freaks
Got a line for the dough
Got a line for the....

[Verse 1: Previn Jones]
Look, I doubled up my solo cup
My nigga that's a duet
Fresh Water Kid baby, that's why I'm getting you wet
I'm the king of the lakes
After this year man I'm upping my rates
I'm motor city 'til they cut my brakes
Got a line for the cream and a line for cake
I pack every box on the calendar
Like I'm moving, you move with the amateurs
Your girl is choosy my nigga I'd handle her
She ain't use to all of these camera's
My little niggas brought hammers
Them hammers on Thor
We worried 'bout ours
You just worry bout yours

[Hook: Doe Wright]
And we lost in the D, in the D
Double cup, double cup
We ain't scared of police
Got a line for the dough
Line for the freaks
Got a line for the dough
Got a line for the...
And we lost in the D, in the D
Double cup, double cup
We ain't scared of police
Got a li-li-line for the dough
Line for the freaks
Got a line for the dough
Got a line for the...

[Verse 2: Amir Obe]
Lost in the D
I ain't seen a cop in a week
Seen my first dead body on the East Side
Took a pic right beside with a peace sign
Hittin' licks on the free time
Fuck I gotta fight for?
Couple bitches from the burbs though
Let them hoes in through the side door
Shit I ain't got time for the bull, triggers I pull, nigga
I ain't got time to be cool
Catch me on the side streets double cupped up, buffed up
Still gettin' fucked up, rolling blunts up
Posted on the porch with the piffy
Plottin' on the mothafuckin' licky
Nine milli on the hippy
Shout out my mothafuckin' city, aye

[Hook: Doe Wright]
And we lost in the D, in the D
Double cup, double cup
We ain't scared of police
Got a line for the dough
Line for the freaks
Got a line for the dough
Got a line for the...
And we lost in the D, in the D
Double cup, double cup
We ain't scared of police
Got a li-li-line for the dough
Line for the freaks
Got a line for the dough
Got a line for the...

[Outro]
Freaks, freaks, freaks, freaks
Freaks, freaks, freaks, freaks
Got a line for the freaks
