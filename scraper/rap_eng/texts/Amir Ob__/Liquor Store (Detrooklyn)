[Native American Sample & Laughter amongst children]

[Verse 1 Amir Ob√®]

We too shook to fool a smile
Cory had us thinking juvenile
We're a team, maybe you should try
To grow some balls you little pussy, it's do or die
Now move aside
Let's find a come up & get this dough
Run up in the store and shoot the ceiling then empty the drawer
Give me the mask, I'll hold the bag, Cory get the cash
Pooh watch the door, Jay got the gun JUST DON'T LET IT GO!
Unless you need to
& after we'll make a run for the school, find a place to dump the tool
Split up if we need to but don't let nobody see you
I'm ready, YOU ready?
Hold it steady, take it off safety
It's basically Halo, just pull the trigger when I say so
New pesos just a bullet away
Liquor Store's open, walked to the door & blew it away
Warning shots hit the ceiling
Confetti falling slow motion, then both the clerks went to kneeling
Heard shotguns fire too, Jay hit the floor his brains hit aisle 2
[Gun Shot]
I owe you (Echo's out)

Whatup Whatup! continues on while Nylz performs for the rest of the song
