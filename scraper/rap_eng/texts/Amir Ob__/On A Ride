[Hook]
I ain't got no time (2x)
Quiet for all that I'm on a ride
I ain't got no time (2x)
Quiet for all that I'm on a ride
No Time
I ain't got no time (4x)

[Verse 1]
Young rich nigga with the power and respect
She gon' get it poppin for the owl on the chest
Crib got a view with the tower and the sunset
I ain't got no time for the talk of who up next
Fuck all that, quiet that shit
Tryna compare us, you wildin and shit
Askin for favors, my phone been on silent and shit
Say we go way back, don't lie to that bitch
Skip all the pillow talkin
Killed all them niggas so now we got them widows talkin
Big moves, we do so lil lil talkin
Don't fuck with you niggas they still talkin
I don't never hear the phone ring
Need Ms for the whole team
Old thing askin bout that old thing
No time

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Runnin through the West I can tell you bout the field
Bustin through the checks I can tell you how it feel
People say they feel me, but they don't feel me
Coming with the fake shit you get the real me
I ain't got no conscious, give no options
Miss me with the come through, think you plottin
Tryna leave the city you just need a way for it
She wanna feel paid make a nigga pay for it yeah
I don't never hear the phone ring
Need Ms for the whole team
Old thing askin bout that old thing
No time
