[Intro]
Wonder why you ain't called yet
Wonder why you ain't called yet
Borderline alcoholic
I'm trippin' but I ain't fall yet
Wonder why you ain't called yet
Wonder why you ain't called yet
Borderline alcoholic
I'm trippin' but I ain't fall yet

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to wake up in cold sweats
There's some thing you ain't know, yeah
All my secrets you told, yeah
All the hearts that you stole, yeah
I've been way too controllin', way too territorial
Now you free, now you free
Now you free
I been territorial but now you free

[Chorus]
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning, morning...
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning
I'll clean it up in the morning
I will
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning, morning...
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning
I'll clean it up in the morning
I will

[Verse 1]
Privacy, I just need privacy
None of you  bitches acknowledge me
I'm still waitin' on apologies
I'm still waitin' on apologies
Waitin', waitin', I been patient, patience
I'm breaking up like it's bad service
Paranoid, I got you mad nervous
Paranoia make the past surface
Paranoia got you, talkin' shit, â€˜round the way
I fuck around, let you know it up
Won't hold it down, won't hit you up

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to wake up in cold sweats
There's something you ain't know, yeah
All my secrets you told, yeah
All the hearts that you stole, yeah
I've been way too controllin', way too territorial
Now you free, now you free
Now you free
I been territorial but now you free

[Chorus]
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning, morning...
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning
I'll clean it up in the morning
I will
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning, morning...
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning
I'll clean it up in the morning
I will
