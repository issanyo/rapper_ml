[Verse]
Pink skies hanging off the balcony
Feel like everybody got it out for me
What’s the difference 'tween a dream and nightmare?
'Cause either way, you standing right there
Staring at me, acting like you care about me
Even in my coffin I’ll look sexy (sexy)
Guarantee you scoffing with your bestie
Fake bitches always meant the most to me
Even though I let them get the most of me
Played dumb let them close to me
Pink skies hanging off the balcony

[Chours]
Ain’t afraid of death, life is but a test
If I Jump, don’t cry for me
Just rewind me, they try to never mind me
If I Jump, living trough these songs
So you know just where to find me
If I jump, don’t you take the blame
Don’t you feel guilty, nothing gon’ change
If I jump, played dumb let them close to me

[Post Chours]
Pink skies hanging off the balcony
Feel like everybody got it out for me
What’s the difference 'tween a dream and nightmare?
'Cause either way, you standing right there
Staring at me

[Outro]
I know is not right
Is he alright
