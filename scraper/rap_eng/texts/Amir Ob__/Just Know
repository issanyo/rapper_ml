[Verse 1]
We the focus, leave the poor shit
I'm on some rich shit, I'm on some boat shit
I'm on a PJ, I'm from the PJs
From the Westside, I'm out in Eastway
I don't say shit, niggas ain't shit
You niggas bitch made, you niggas Caitlyn
There's no mistaken, I'm straight out the way with it
Swipin' the debby, I pay wit it, say I won't
Been broke and bougie in Saint Lauren
Still cop a loosy, man, say I won't
Might tuck the toolie, man, say I won't
Runnin' the city, man,  say I don't
You gettin' desperate, I need the money to the decimal
I flooded the Rollie just to mess with you
Red bone, red seats, more money, less sleep
Just know, if she say she love me it ain't mutual
She introduced to the team, that's the usual
They hate on me, bro, only you would know
West side, East side, fuck around with each side, each time
I ain't gon' fuck around, me time
When you get to stunt like he lyin

[Hook]
Just know, hit me if you need plugs
Just know, hit me if you need drugs
Hit me with the word, hit you with the serve
Hit me, just know, you should hit me, hit me

[Verse 2]
I'm touchin' the cake, bustin' the bank
As long as my brothers is straight
Breakin' the profit I made
Free all the partners upstate
Just wait till all of my partners is done with probate
Take em off the corner to the border clear the customs
Can't afford to fuckin' function
I kinda sorta had enough with ya
Might go back on what it was wit you
Do it big, wanna puff wit ya, wanna cut from ya
Hold it down, I want the trust from ya, that's a must from ya
Mama outta debt, wallet lookin' blessed
Fuck me is fuck you, don't talk 'bout respect
Check, check, check after fuckin' check
Check for me, city rep for me
Just know

[Hook]
Just know, hit me if you need plugs
Just know, hit me if you need drugs
Hit me with the word, hit you with the serve
Hit me, just know, you should hit me, hit me
