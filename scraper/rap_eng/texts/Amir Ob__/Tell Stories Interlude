[Verse 1]
I don’t do interviews, Lord
Look like I’m giving you, nah
Stories that you living through, yeah
Ain’t really adding up to much
Gucci, Versace bragging about the Louis
Got the gas, ashing in the cut
Asking ‘bout the past
Asking 'bout the last
Girl I fucked, yeah
That’s too much to ask
I just went and copped the half
OG stinking out the bag
OG press him for the pass
Passing through for the band

[Chorus]
I ain’t tryna tell stories
I been countin' all morning
Spilling feelings, let you air it out
I don’t care what you care about
I’m just tryna chill, fuck the camera
Good girls turn to dancers
Hit you with a dab, dab, dab, dab
Asking questions, I don’t answer
They gon' hit me for the favor
Bad bitches need a savior
Hit you with a dab, dab, dab, dab
Leave no liquor for the chaser

[Verse 2]
Spilling liquor on the sinks
I been filling up the safe
Ain’t no tint up on the Wraith
Let these bitches see my face
Golden child in the projects
Who be talking all this nonsense?
Kicking women out the studio
Hoes be fucking up the process
This ain’t the time and the place
Flooded the time and face
Telling them lies out the face
Fuck hoe, get up out my way

[Chorus]
I ain’t tryna tell stories
I been countin' all morning
Spilling feelings, let you air it out
I don’t care what you care about
I’m just tryna chill, fuck the camera
Good girls turn to dancers
Hit you with a dab, dab, dab, dab
Asking questions, I don’t answer
They gon' hit me for the favor
Bad bitches need a savior
Hit you with a dab, dab, dab, dab
Leave no liquor for the chaser
