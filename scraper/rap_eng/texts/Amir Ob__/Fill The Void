[Intro: Daniel Caesar]
You are the only
One that I need, I...
Want you to know I...
Want you to be my
Lady at night time
But you don't need me
You just hate to be alone
I just might have you undressing
I hate when you got me stressing
Cause baby I'm choosey
I choose you

[Verse 1: Amir Obe]
Only one way to communicate
Put it out there just in case you doubt it
I'mma let these hoes know I'm doing straight
You just tryna fill the void
But these boys so weak to you
Always tryna speak to you
Watered down me's that forever try and reach for you
I just had to creep to you
Use me as a reference
You'll never find an other one
You Khaled with another one
Yeah, talk ain't cheap when nobody at the grapevine
I walked that line
When I'm not just tryna see signs, staring at the grey skies
Hit the town for you
Cut ties with these bitches cause I'm down for you
Let's get away, fuck around and smoke a pound with you
I'm still amazed I ain't never heard a sound from you

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Amir Obe]
I'm in the moment, don't tell me I'm blowing up
Relations with you got me growing up
Word after word it's all poetry
In person it's hard just to open up
I'm doing some things I ain't proud of
I'm thinking that you might have found love
I'm thinking I'm drinking to drown up
You're thinking I'm drinking to round up
Stare at the mic like I'm looking at you
Taking cues from them bitches, that don't care about you
Shit be getting old, say I'm acting brand new
Doing all this shit that you said I can't do
Yeah, phone about to die, told her come through
Told me that you lit, I said I'm drunk too
Bae I'm off that Henny and that skunk too
Hit me if you ready, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
