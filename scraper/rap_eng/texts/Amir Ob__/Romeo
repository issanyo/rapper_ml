[Verse]
I won't shed a tear again
Woke up on a pyramid
Man in the mirror, ooh
I see Mir again
Right side pleading
Left side evil
If I go and get emo, I might need you
My baby don’t cry no more
(Miro don’t lie no more)
My baby don’t cry no more (baby don't cry no)

[Pre-Chorus]
Roses die before you seen 'em, yeah (roses die)
Double meaning, yeah
What's love without the feeling, yeah

[Chorus]
Prophecy tell me I’ma die in a rari
Black tux, runaway bride, I’m sorry

Prophecy tell me I’ma die in a rari
Black tux, runaway bride, I’m sorry

[Post-Chorus]
Thinkin' of busting a you
Roll me a blunt up or two
Get me right back in the mood
Get me right back in the mood

Thinkin' of busting a you
Roll me a blunt up or two
Get me right back in the mood
Get me right back in the mood

[Bridge]
Unapologetic, yeah, said it, ooh
I just might be wrong though
Thought that's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
Roses die before you seen 'em, yeah (roses die)
Double meaning, yeah
What's love without the feeling, yeah

[Chorus]
Prophecy tell me I’ma die in a rari
Black tux, runaway bride, I’m sorry

Prophecy tell me I’ma die in a rari
Black tux, runaway bride, I’m sorry

[Post-Chorus]
Thinkin' of busting a you
Roll me a blunt up or two
Get me right back in the mood
Get me right back in the mood

Thinkin' of busting a you
Roll me a blunt up or two
Get me right back in the mood
Get me right back in the mood

Thinkin' of busting a you
Roll me a blunt up or two
Get me right back in the mood
Get me right back in the mood

Thinkin' of busting a you
Roll me a blunt up or two
Get me right back in the mood
Get me right back in the mood, ay

[Outro]
Prophecy tell me I’ma die in a rari
Black tux, runaway bride, I’m sorry
Prophecy tell me I’ma die in a rari
Black tux, runaway bride, I’m sorry
Prophecy tell me I’ma die in a rari
Black tux, runaway bride, I’m sorry
Prophecy tell me I’ma die in a rari
Black tux, runaway bride, I’m sorry
Prophecy tell me I’ma die in a rari
Black tux, runaway bride, I’m sorry
Prophecy tell me I’ma die in a rari
Black tux, runaway bride, I’m sorry
