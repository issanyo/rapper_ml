[Verse 1]
I, I, I... never read ya
I got amnesia
I don't remember
I got a temper
You stalkin' now
I fuck around
You fuck around
We both not proud
You said I'm different
I'm difficult
You said I'm missin'
I'm missin' you
You poppin' up
I'm poppin' out
They talkin' now
Just block 'em out

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, new phone, who dis?
New threat, do it
Don't kill the vibe, bitch, I'm too lit
Them rumors come from you, I knew it, knew it

[Chorus]
Yeah, if you overthinkin', I get high with you
If you ever sinkin', I go down with you
All I need my baby and a cigarette
Convo gettin' dry but I can get it wet
Yeah, if you overthinkin', I get high with you
If you ever sinkin', I go down with you
All I need my baby and a cigarette
Convo gettin' dry but I can get it wet

[Verse 2]
I can see your true colors, ain't nothin' true
I been with you two summers, ain't nothin' new
Watch you get done up and tell me it's for me
See you in public, you actin' differently
Brand new, brand new, brand new
'Bout to dumb it down, don't understand you
Ain't no point in flexin' 'cause I am too
Flexin', flexin', flexin' like a dance move

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, new phone, who dis?
New threat, do it
Don't kill the vibe, bitch, I'm too lit
Them rumors come from you, I knew it, knew it

[Chorus]
Yeah, if you overthinkin', I get high with you
If you ever sinkin', I go down with you
All I need my baby and a cigarette
Convo gettin' dry but I can get it wet
Yeah, if you overthinkin', I get high with you
If you ever sinkin', I go down with you
All I need my baby and a cigarette
Convo gettin' dry but I can get it wet
Yeah, if you overthinkin', I get high with you
If you ever sinkin', I go down with you
All I need my baby and a cigarette
Convo gettin' dry but I can get it wet
Yeah, if you overthinkin', I get high with you
If you ever sinkin', I go down with you
All I need my baby and a cigarette
Convo gettin' dry but I can get it wet
