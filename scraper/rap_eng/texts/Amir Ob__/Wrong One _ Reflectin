Wrong One

[Hook: Amir Obe]

Smoking got me overthinking, feel like I'm up plus I'm on one
Keep that fake love on your side
Ooh you just fucked with the wrong one
Ooh you just fucked with the wrong one

[Verse 1: Amir Obe]

Beefing over blocks, where you be at
I don't tuck chains, you can see that, believe that
Bout to ghost on these hoes so they feel that
Music don't work, flipping work, where the key at?
Posted with the posse case a nigga run up
Focused on the milli, plotting on the come up
Holding on a nina, waiting for the re-up
Rolling up the swisher, blowing on the reefer

[Hook: Amir Obe]

Smoking got me overthinking, feel like I'm up plus I'm on one
Keep that fake love on your side
Ooh you just fucked with the wrong one
Ooh you just fucked with the wrong one

[Verse 2: GOV]

Amir just told me kill em, I just load it, let it spray out
It's funny that these bars are the only fucking way out
These chains make me feel free, you know I got a few on
She badder than Tinashe, when I'm 2 on, I'm too gone
Got these girls bout to fall but you know I rise
Always working round the clock, so I ain't got the time
I ain't stopping for a minute, I'm too committed
All my exes tryna cross me when I'm in their city

[Bridge: GOV]
I tell em keep it movin'
I ain't hearing no excuses
Man this just me on my new shit
Winner$ Circle, got my crew here, yeah

[Voicemail Interlude]

Hey..I've been trying to get through to you for the longest now
It's like you never wanna talk no more..like you're too busy for me and shit
I don't know..I just thought you were different
Call me

Reflectin

[Verse 1: GOV]

Eating Italian with an Indian ting I know
Savour the moment while the waiter pour the wine slow
Pull up in the Uber to Yorkville, Vaticano
But I ain't really there, I'm lost in thought and my minds gone
Trying to find myself got me losing sleep
Like would they really love me if I wasn't me
Lately I been seeing 4am too much
Facing the lows by getting high, I'm just too blunt

[Bridge: GOV]

Reflectin, the shit that I'm smoking and sipping got me overthinking and I'm stressin
Changing my life got me killing myself in some ways, no question yeah
When I'm at my worst I sit down and I write some of my best shit yeah
Sinning and asking forgiveness and counting up blessings

[Verse 2: GOV]

Life moving at this fast pace
I wonder how much liquor can this glass take
Fuck the glass I wonder when I'ma reach the limit
Will I make it to the pinnacles I plan on hitting
I'm closing in, this here's a moment and
Me and Amir with the wave switching flows on them
The way it's all been gwanin when I'm going in
Feeling like I was made for this, I'm the chosen, and

[Outro: GOV]

Smoking got me overthinking, the shit that I'm on is too strong
Had to get this shit off of my mind, these nights that I live got me on one
Yeah yeah yeah
These nights that I live got me on one
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh, oh, oh
