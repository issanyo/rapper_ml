[Verse 1]
Talking game, bless you, wipe it up
Bring your nose, I could white you up
All em demons you been fighting, yeah
Crack a smile, I seen you crying - oh yeah

[Pre-Hook]
I recorded all of this in project housing
I just skipped the pat-down and I snuck an ounce in
Here up in the hoodie got the models bouncing
Walking through just got me twenty thousand

[Hook]
Fuck is you calling me for?
Fuck is you calling me for?
Imma roll with the lost ones
You in VIP looking so
Unimportant and I know how you roll
Yeah, then I go up
Top down I'm finna go up
Hoes down, finna go up
Tings tings, finna go up

[Verse 2]
Used to ride the train, I got a seat for you
Used to keep it faithful, now I cheat for you
I ain't stalked the number, yeah I creep for you
I just want the same I don't need from you

[Pre-Hook]
I recorded all of this in project housing
I just skipped the pat-down and I snuck an ounce in
Here up in the hoodie got the models bouncing
Walking through just got me twenty thousand

[Hook]
Fuck is you calling me for?
Fuck is you calling me for?
Imma roll with the lost ones
You in VIP looking so
Unimportant and I know how you roll
Yeah, then I go up
Top down I'm finna go up
Hoes down, finna go up
Tings tings, finna go up
