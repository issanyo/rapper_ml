[Verse 1: ?]
Walk in the building with no fucks given
Got a bad bitch and she stay whippin'
My ex girl just hit me up stay trippin'
Deuces in my cup I stay sippin'
I need it I need it I need it
The vibe got me goin' I'm [?]
Man I'm so lit I feel like I copped a new Rari with the roof missin'

[Verse 2: Amir Obe]
Drinking getting faded just to clear my mind up
Where'd the time go?
We ain't really have no time off
I been known, fuck them niggas cause they not, oh
Oh yeah, pour up, tell my niggas pour up
Dusse I need more, gimme more, gimme more
