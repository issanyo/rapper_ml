You play the victim I ain’t no hero
Seem like you love me more when I had a deal yo
[?] route, got the pussy on drought
Uh, I need more mouth
Uh, go all out
[?] with ya ass all out
Sike nah, that was type wrong
Tryna write wrongs
Then I write songs
Made the foundation to roll dice on
All night long
I been thinkin' about me, you, and a dyke broad
Whipped by the python
Sex with the lights on
Kept all the ice on, just to hear the chink
[?] and my eyes on chink
Modern love it never gets deep
It never gets real
Never gets sweet
Ima be selfish and think about me
I must be stupid to think about dreams
You must think Cupid is aiming at me
But I dodge arrows like a hood pharaoh
It’s crazy I might care though if it graze me
But I’ll use you as a shield if I feel used cause the true you is fugazi (Bitch)

I’m like Rondo with the green
It’s a whole lot of bricks and assists
Long as my team good I’ll never be pissed
Long as I stay naive I’ll never be shit
Mm, how do I even exist
Room full of hoes, and I text, “I miss you”
19, flow with a sick view
I’m just a nigga you live through
Wish I had a better outlook
Wish you could see how the crowd look
Everybody gave me a proud look
Uh, don’t pinch me
I’m dreaming
Don’t miss me, but don’t leave me
Cause I ain’t gonna lie
Lately I seen all the goods slip by
[?] but girl we get by
And we gon' break up to say that we tried
And you gon' say, “Fuck you, hope that you die”
K-Karma gon' kill me all of them lies
F-Fucked up the entree all of them sides [?] and light the small fry
[?] the sound of your cry
Story our life
