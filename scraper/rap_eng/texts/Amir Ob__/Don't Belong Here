[Verse 1]
You just feelin' sorry for yourself
All that drinkin' bad for your health
You been smokin' way too much
You been on the road too much
You don't ever tell me how you feel
You don't ever wanna keep it real
Lately, you been lookin' stressed out
You should prolly go and get out, ay
You lost a lot of friends on the way
Heard them say that you been actin' fake
Heard them say that you been fallin' off
When the fuck you gonna drop a song?
You should prolly go and get some help right now
Thinkin' you should do it for yourself right now
Need to start actin' like you care right now
I'ma get the keys and take you there right now

[Chorus]
I don't belong here (I don't belong here)
I don't belong here (I don't belong here)
I don't belong here, hey (I don't belong here)
(Bad, bad, bad)
I don't belong here (I don't belong here)
I don't belong here (I don't belong here)
I don't belong here, hey (I don't belong here)
Bad, bad, bad

[Interlude]
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
You don't ever look them in the eye
Always giving up before you try
Saw you on stage looking shaky
Prolly why you fucking up lately (look at you, look at you)
Now you lookin' restless (look at you, look at you)
You gon' learn your lesson
Why you stress you exes?
You know you ain’t helpless
I’m glad that you felt this
Quit looking for the exit
Look at you
Disgusted, you've been disappointed ever since you dropped that one shit
All them fuckin sad songs, you ain’t drop shit
You’ve been on that drunk shit (you, you, you, you, you)
That’s enough, that’s enough, that’s enough
That’s enough, tough love gon’ hurt when you out of love
When you out of love

[Chorus]
I don't belong here (I don't belong here)
I don't belong here (I don't belong here)
I don't belong here, hey (I don't belong here)
(Bad, bad, bad)
I don't belong here (I don't belong here)
I don't belong here (I don't belong here)
I don't belong here, hey (I don't belong here)
Bad, bad, bad

[Interlude]
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
