[Chorus]
I need rehab
I need an intervention
I need help
I’m going through hell
Just to find heaven
I need an intervention

[Verse 1]
Broke my promise, I'm not honest
I used to have it, think I lost it
Crashed my whip, slit my wrist
I laughed it off, I’m that lit
Forgot to call mama, forgot to call pops
My baby actin' jealous, she just called the cops

[Pre-Chorus]
Got arrested again
I’m reckless again
You know me too well by now

[Chorus]
I need rehab
I need an intervention
I need help
I’m going through hell
Just to find heaven
I need an intervention
Need an intervention

[Verse 2]
I just played myself, I thought you need my help
I can't help myself, can't protect myself
My reflection now, broke the mirror
I can't face myself
I think I hate myself
We’ve been wylin’ out
Downtown fighting now
In public crying now
Somebody called the cops

[Pre-Chorus]
Got arrested again
I’m reckless again
You know me too well by now

[Chorus]
I need rehab
I need an intervention
I need help
I’m going through hell
Just to find heaven
I need an intervention
I need rehab
I need an intervention
I need help
I’m going through hell
Just to find heaven
I need an intervention
