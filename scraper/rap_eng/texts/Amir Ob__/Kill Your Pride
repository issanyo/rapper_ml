[Verse 1]
Smoking something right for the wrongs now
Make these bitches sing along now
Don't let them lyrics leave you wanting now
I'm still fucking all them broads now
I lost patience in a waitress
She been living too complacent
All them rumors make me anxious
Where'd you get your information? You...

[Chorus]
Cause every time I'm around you
You be acting different you ain't acting like yourself
Here's a bullet for your pride babe
Here’s a bullet for you, pull the trigger
Cause every time I'm around you
You just got some bad news for me babe
Here's a bullet for your pride babe
Here’s a bullet for you, pull the trigger

[Verse 2]
To you I'm just a struggle rapper
Go for low blows, then you suck me after
I hear the chatter and the sudden laughter
Now who's fast-forward? I don't hustle backwards
I got you humming to my songs, yeah
Girl you used to cut me off, yeah
Now I got it like I said I would
And you ain't saying nothing, like I said you would
'Bout to set the wood on fire
Bitch I wish you would, call mine yeah
Off brand niggas tryna cuff you
Pillow talking to yourself, I don't judge you
Used to never say you proud of me
It's awkward that you doubted me
I just copped the whip and a house for me
Fuck approval, I'mma vouch for me

[Chorus]
Cause every time I'm around you
You be acting different you ain't acting like yourself
Here's a bullet for your pride babe
Here’s a bullet for you, pull the trigger
Cause every time I'm around you
You just got some bad news for me babe
Here's a bullet for your pride babe
Here’s a bullet for you, pull the trigger
