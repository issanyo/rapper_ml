[Chorus]
8 missed calls
17 texts
5 in the morning, you ain’t sleep yet, no
Take a deep breath
Need to reset
Eight missed calls, Seventeen texts
Five in the morning, you ain’t sleep yet, no
Take a deep breath
Need to reset

[Verse]
Wait up late for me
We’ve been up and down
Ask my whereabouts
I’m at up and down
Don’t you hang up
Don’t you drain me
Don’t you change me
I’m the same me
You should thank me
You should thank me
You ungrateful
Don’t you hate me
I don’t hate you
I just thank you
You know it, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Ayo
All white vibes with the halo
Lost my mind if you say so
I’ll be right there if you wait tho

[Chorus]
8 missed calls
17 texts
5 in the morning, you ain’t sleep yet, no
Take a deep breath
Need to reset
Eight missed calls, Seventeen texts
Five in the morning, you ain’t sleep yet, no
Take a deep breath
Need to reset
