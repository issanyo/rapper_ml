[Intro]
You used to look so conceited, yeah
Now you look so defeated
If I knew what I know now
Would have been said "slow down"
Lookin' for a reason
Lookin' for a reason
Tell you I ruined you
I ruined, I prove it to you

[Chorus]
You hide tears with a smile
Wonder you been grinnin' for a while
Don't let your pride hear me wrong
Don't let my drive steer you wrong
You hide tears with a smile
Wonder you been grinnin' for a while
Don't let your pride hear me wrong
Don't let my drive steer you wrong

[Bridge]
Hmm, turnin' the table
I'm still on the table
Talkin' about
I'm still on the table
Talkin' about
Whatchu talkin' about?

[Verse]
If the moon stay up and the clocks don't work, I'll be there for you
Must’ve heard everybody that I care for say I don’t care for you
And I'mma keep venting, best believe I’m never runnin' out of air for you
So when the moon stay up and the clocks don't work, I'll be there for you
Why, why, why, why?

[Chorus]
You hide tears with a smile
Wonder you been grinnin' for a while
Don't let your pride hear me wrong
Don't let my drive steer you wrong
You hide tears with a smile
Wonder you been grinnin' for a while
Don't let your pride hear me wrong
Don't let my drive steer you wrong
