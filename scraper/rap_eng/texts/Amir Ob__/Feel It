[Verse 1]
Yeah, drinking Henny, curving calls
Might text her back and nerk the broad
Harsh cold, girl I thought you knew
I break your heart before the night is trough
Never sober, never stressin' neither
Might fuck 'em hoes, but never keep 'em
If she had to choose she'd never leave him
But she satisfied with just the weekend
Yeah, she gon' smoke like that
I be chiefin'
I stay high, don't believe 'em peeking
Fuck your head up, don't believe in cheating
But she gonna fuck with no fucking reason
Don't need love cause the lust is fulfilled
Trust is unreal and girl you blind
If you don't need love, then girl you mine

[Pre-Hook]
Ah, I guess I got it like that
Everytime I'm wrong she be comin' right back
And even though I fuck up, she ain't never gon' leave

[Hook]
She don't wanna feel it again
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
You need a second, I need a weapon
To kill the interment vibe
The g-code, the cheating
I got infinite lives
And you get attached
And I'll act suprised
But you see is arrogant, there's fear in the skies
I can't decide
Money, love or fucking
I fucking love money
But it's never either-or
And I always needed more
And you feel like you missin' something
Need somebody to miss or something
Kisses, hugging something different then these fucking
What the fâ€“

[Pre-Hook]
Ah, I guess I got it like that
Everytime I'm wrong she be comin' right back
And even though I fuck up, she ain't never gon' leave

[Hook]
She don't wanna feel it again
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it
She gon' feel it, she gon' feel it
