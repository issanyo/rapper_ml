[Refrain]
Do what I do, niggas be asking for too much
Used to play them, now they choose up
Middle fingers, I got two up

[Verse 1]
True say I’m the truest
Make them bitches say they blew it
Fuck these niggas and they two cents
Take my baby out to Ruth's Chris
You said I wouldn’t be shit
You said I wouldn’t be this
Theat’s some shit I probably shouldn’t say
Trap money that I put away
Don’t you hit me for the discount
Shut the fuck up, I’m counting
All these niggas want to diss now
I been out here moving mountains

[Refrain]
Do what I do, niggas be asking for too much
Used to play them, now they choose up
Middle fingers, I got two up

[Hook]
Big shit been happening here
Big shit been happening here
Big shit been happening here
Big shit been happening here

[Verse 2]
Fuck niggas gotta merge
Hit these bitches with the curve
All these bitches say they love me
Tell them it’ll never work

[Hook]
Big shit been happening here
Big shit been happening here
Big shit been happening here
Big shit been happening here

[Verse 3]
Broke boy get money now
Grey days turn sunny now
Skinny nigga got a tummy now
Money, money, money now

[Hook]
Big shit been happening here
Big shit been happening here
Big shit been happening here
Big shit been happening here
