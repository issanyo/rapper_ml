[Verse 1: Amir Obe]
Same old me, still no good
Tied up with the talk and the drama
Fucking ‘til the sun up and I’m gone
Looking for relations baby, nah, nah, nah
Lowkey feeling like a star though
Looking for affection, I been hollow
I remember writing all them songs, you the subject
I am just your ex, not your ex that you up next
Sometimes I gotta shit on you
Routines bringing all the bitch out you
Moving through the city, you’ll be running to me
Fuck these bitches saying, I be running the street
Yeah, where, where you go?
You ain’t never seen it all
Pockets, pockets, got my change up
I be leaning with you later

[Hook: Eli Sostre]
Yeah, you're the one that I need, oh
You're the one that I wanted
You're the one I get high for
You're the one that I lean on
Get high for, high for
Get high for, high for
You're the one that I lean on
Get high for, high for
Get high for, high for
Yeah, you're the one that I need, oh
You're the one that I wanted
You're the one I get high for
You're the one that I lean on
Aye, you're the one that I lean on

[Verse 2: Eli Sostre]
Same old me, still no good
Blew my mind, I'm still so hood
From the projects, man, I thought you understood
On vacay, bring her back to the hood
Ain't shit, just quick inspo
Still fucking bitches, smoking out the window
Still treat me like a star, like she didn't know
We just move lowkey, no info
Wasn't fucking back then, we're on the floor now
Boss up, rolling weed in the club now
Fuck the who's who and the what's what now
She go coo-coo I'm a new drug now
You could pick the flight we'll figure it out, yeah
You could pick the night we'll figure it out, yeah
I don't even know what you're tripping about
You should hit the uber and get out the house, yeah
