[Verse 1: Amir Obè]
Got no friends to lose, I ain't got no benz to cruise
I just got some shit to move
And by the time I do they gone
Act like they was with it all along and rep for you
Hope you haters suck a dick and die fuckin' too
New city, new view, what it be like, fuck
Like a hooker ain't a hooker if it's free, right?
We been goin' at it, goin' at it for like three nights
Cause we gon' make it feel right

[Hook]
Puff puff pass, homie light it up
Can't tell me nothin' cause I don't give a fuck
Puff puff pass, you know the routine
If ain't gettin' money then you ain't on my team
Come smoke with a killah'
Come smoke with a killah'
Come smoke with a killah'

[Verse 2: Amir Obè]
Got the lean and liquor, got a thing for strippers
Poppin' band after band, screamin' free my niggas
Made a scene, now I'm just tryin' to chill out
Main chick trippin', like what you doin' still out?
Turn that ace to the face, took my hold of the mercy
Ain't got straight to the chase if wifey I'mma curve her
Shawty follow my order, I catch bodies no feelings
Why you drinking the pain away? smoke this for the healin' ohh

[Hook]
Puff puff pass, homie light it up
Can't tell me nothin' cause I don't give a fuck
Puff puff pass, you know the routine
If ain't gettin' money then you ain't on my team
Come smoke with a killah'
Come smoke with a killah'
Come smoke with a killah'

[Outro]
Smoke this for the healin' ohh
