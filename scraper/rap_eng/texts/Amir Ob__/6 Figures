(Luu Breeze)
Verse

Hold on
Who that nigga that u wanted girl for so long
You been tripping I been getting money all ways
They been hating praying that a nigga call quits
If I ain't poppin I can't do it
What you call this
Insert Khaled with another one

This year I need the whole pot
And you're  feeling ya new shit, but ya the hoes not
If that's ya man he stuck with u get ya both shot
Ohh yes

I got women cross the border that don't belong to me
But for LUUPAC she'll ditch her friends and her thong for me
And tho my friends tell me she wrong for me
Told TyTy back to business
On the line I'm talking

6 figures (6figures)
I get it get it

Though I got thousands
I need more I'm talking 6 figures
Don't call my line if we ain't talking 6
How u mean ?
Need 6Figuress dirty, clean
Hold the line
I'm talking 6Figures

I get it get it
Repeat 1x

Prayer hands
Bless the set now
I ain’t with the love
I been unimpressed now
Gucci tracksuit when a n*gga tryna dress down/
Weed in the hookah, yea I’m out of breath now
313, yea the long way
Project baby, I been flippin in the hallway
Put my ex’s on that ecstasy
Gave a fraction but the streets had the rest of me/
Hoes tryna reach
I been out the way
Let them preach, local women got a lot to say
6 figures, I don’t chase it check the chase account/ 6 figures, I put in more than I’m taking out


(Emerson Brooks)

I'm thinking bout it all the time now
All I really got is right now
A youngin workin when the lights go down
Yeah the money make it nice out
Hold on
What's up with all these fake friends
I know a couple in the east end
Who ask me if I know The Weeknd
Do you wanna know a secret
Not too long ago I was barely breathing
Now to the money, to the money where I'm speeding diving in the deep end fuck your defense
Put in the bag love
Go and fill it up
There's never know enough
I'm talking 6 figures

(Luu Breeze)

How u mean ?
Need 6Figuress dirty, clean
Hold the line
I'm talking 6Figures

I get it get it
