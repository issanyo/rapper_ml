[Verse 1]
Stop all the talking, they say
Threats come too often these days
We're going running and running around
Fuck around gon' beat ya man down
She dolled up with that photo, yeah
Drunk bitch tryna' make convo, yeah
She just want me cause I'm next
She just want me cause I'm next, yeah yeah
If she keep talkin' bout her ex
Need to put the pussy on reset, yeah yeah
Just want the respect
I'll go for me and my set
Ask bout my side, I say west
Ask bout my life, I say blessed

[Hook]
Say no more, say no more
You heard it all
You heard it all before (3X)

[Verse 2]
See you on MediaTakeOut
Used to be Netflix and take out
Pass through the city, I think about you
You know that it's you when I sing about you
Drunk dialing, I'm wildin'
Can tell that you care when you crying
Can tell that you gave up on trying
Front like it's love, we been lying
Yeah, just want the respect
I'll go for me and my set
Ask bout my side, I say west
Ask bout my life, I say blessed

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Throwing up the west, smoking on the best
Headed to the east, let you know we eatin'
I be in the street, I be in the streak
You be in the birds throwing up the bees
Sitting pretty in the drought
Broke niggas love to say "Meet me at the top"
Rollin' up the loud, I got the whole city proud
Couple niggas made it, I'm like "Where they at now?"
Back to back Benzes on Broadway
Black on black lenses in broad day
Fuck what a broad say, I'm getting brain while I'm listening to Sade
Smooth operator, if I don't do it for myself I do it for the haters
Do it for the paper, do it for the love
She ain't fucking for the money, she gon do it just because nigga
Throwing up the west, smoking on the best
Headed to the east, let you know we eating'
I be in the street, I be in the streak
You be in the birds throwing up the bees
Sittin' pretty in the drought
Broke niggas love to say "Meet me at the top"
Rollin' up the loud, I got the whole city proud
Couple niggas made it, I'm like "Where they at now?"
