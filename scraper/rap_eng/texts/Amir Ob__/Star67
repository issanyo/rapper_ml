[Intro]
(Uh)
I don't
I don't know why
I don't know why, but
Thats just how it is
How it is

[Verse 1]
Yeah man I don't give a fuck
Sick of all this shit, sick of being sick
Sick of everything, I am Sick of everything
Yeah you heard me say it, Can't explain it but I'm frustrated over stupid stuff
Think I've had enough, can't Handle it no more
Please shut the door I don't wanna talk I don't wanna talk, sorry if it's rude I am not in the mood
Busy with this other shit, I am just so confused, I dont know what to do, I don't know how to act, lost track of time
Man I'm so sick of waisting time
I just wanna be a king n' run amuck
Ring Ring Pick it up what the fuck do you want
Star 67 man bout to go full Armageddon fam
Ma' Hands Flexin' wit a bottle of gabapentin while battlin' aggression of Havin' a vision of heaven
But religion Is still something I like to question
Cuz I don't see too many answers
N' My Brain is becoming a cancer
N' I don't feel like survivin'
It's been a while since I've seen myself smilin'
And I'm starting space out losing focus
Look in the mirror slap myself until I can focus
It's not healthy, but do not tell me what I can n' cannot do
Gimmie a gap of any size n' I'll slide through
Don't deny me of my goals
Don't deprive me of a soul
These nights cold when you don't have a blanket
When you just tryin' to make it
When you wake up hopin' for this shit to change but it's all the same
I was born this way
If your reading this then it's way too late
If your reading this then my future wasn't too great
And there's nothin' left say and there's nothin' left say
This is not a new day, there is no joy left in my voice
Sad to say it but
Sad to say it but
That's just how it is
How it is
