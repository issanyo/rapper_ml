[Verse 1]
Hey, I don't ever cry but the songs do
Rights never stick like the wrongs do
I'm right here with the songs boo
Listen up, listen up
Petty on the way now
Petty on the way now
How dare you show your face now?

[Chorus]
I can't save her only God can
I can't save her only God can
I won't waste a prayer for you
No I won't waste a prayer

I can't save her only God can
I can't save her only God can
No I won't waste a prayer for you
No I won't waste a prayer for you

[Verse 2]
Gorgeous donâ€™t tempt me
I'm taken but empty
I kissed her for thrills
I know this ain't healthy, I'm sorry
I'm sober, I mean it, I'm sorry, hmm
Vices won't help me
I tried it's too deadly
I'm trying to stay up
I know this ain't healthy, I'm sorry
I'm sober, I mean it, I'm sorry

[Instrumental Break]

Yeah I'm sorry

[Chorus]
I can't save her only God can
I can't save her only God can
I won't waste a prayer for you
No I won't waste a prayer

I can't save her only God can
I can't save her only God can
No I won't waste a prayer for you
No I won't waste a prayer for you

[Verse 3]
Slurr on the phone say I love you
Murder she wrote saying I trust you
I get more social after cup 2
I think we vibin' she want a cup too
I might tell her to spend the night with me
Slip up on purpose just so she fights with me
I cross my heart and hope you die with me
I cross my heart and hope you die with me

[Outro]
Romeo, Juliet, Look at what I did
Looking like a movie set, look at what I did
About to fuck the party up, look at what I did
Body, body, body yeah, look at what I did
Romeo, Juliet, Look at what I did
Looking like a movie set, look at what I did
About to fuck the party up, look at what I did
