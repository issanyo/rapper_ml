[Verse]
Baby you a beautiful stress
I don't got a cigarette yes
I just got a match and a fuse
Burnin' out, I'ma use it on you
I could really use a distraction
I been really used to you askin'
I could really use a real one
I feel for you, you ain't never feel enough
Young Love, we pretend we not numb
Molly in the Smart Water 'til we go dumb
If it's feelin' old ima save us cause we young
Never really mean it when we say we both done, no
Real you when you show up
Real me and you grow up
Ain't no real love, ain't no real love (ain't no real love)
Ain't no real love, ain't no real love (ain't no real love)

[Chorus]
It's okay, it's okay now
But we don't know it any other way now
[?], I feel the same now
[?], it's okay now
It's okay, it's okay now
But we don't know it any other way now
[?], I feel the same now
[?], it's okay now

[Bridge]
Yeah, I take the blame for the karma
I take the blame for the drama
I take the blame for the jealousy
I take the blame for your enemies
Yeah, I take the blame for the pain love
I take the blame it ainâ€™t the same love
I take the blame for the jealousy
I take the blame for your enemies
Yeah-eaaah

[Outro]
I don't even know what to say
Pull up to the crib with some Roses
Make-up still running down ur face
Cause you were still dealin' with emotions
My good intentions go to waste
Gettin' caught up where the hoes is
Yo whatever happened to the flame?
'Cause me and you was looking like the closest, yeah yeah
