[Verse 1]
Little kids wanna get up on the court
Play at your own risk
And if you gonna dribble like this
Then you gonna get ripped

'Bout to hit them with that ether
Talking 'bout how I ain't got no girl, so what?
You ain't got no girlfriend neither!
Where she at? I don't see her!

I'm a tear you apart
Now you in a pool of sharks
Remember when I used to go up to the park
Sitting on the sideline 'til after dark
They wouldn't let me play
But that's okay
'cause now I'm on the court all day
Get to have it my way
I'm a make all you little kids pay

Thinking that because you just some little kids
That I'm gonna go soft?
Wrong!
You bring it up in my crib
You gonna get that ball tossed

Why don't you kids quit playing so much dang video games
Oh, you play NBA 2K?
Well guess what?
Now you in the streets and it ain't the same!
What?!

[Chorus]
'Cause my jumper's insane
Now watch me make it rain
When I step in the lane
You know I'm 'bout to bang
- These kids can't hang!

Because I put in work
On the court 'til it hurt
These kids coming in last
And I'm coming in first
- 'cause these kids dirt!

'Cause my jumper's insane
Now watch me make it rain
When I step in the lane
You know I'm 'bout to bang
- These kids can't hang!

Because I put in work
On the court 'til it hurt
These kids coming in last
And I'm coming in first
- 'cause these kids dirt!

[Verse 2]
Get up, you ain't hurt. You ain't hurt at all
Yeah, I seen you fall
Whaa
Come on punk, check ball
You just trying to stall
Go and get your mom, I don't care
Punk, go and get your dad
Go and bring'em on the court
I'm a dunk on them and laugh (Haha!)

Yo, is that your dad?
Oh sir it's nice to meet you
Earlier I was running 'round running my mouth
Talking 'bout how I was gonna beat you
I was playing
I didn't mean what I was saying
You know how it is man
You just get caught up in the game
Yes, I'm very sorry sir, here you can have my chain

Let's squash this beef
We don't got to do this in these streets
These little kids they don't need to see this
Come on dear sir, please
Here, meet my friend Mike
He's somebody you would like
There's no reason we should fight
I live my life, you live your life

Let me run into the house
I got another chain that you can have
Oh, and little man I'm sorry
I didn't know that was your dad
He's just stood there talking to Mike
He ain't got no idea I'm about to take flight
Dude tried to punk me?
Punk's playing with his life, right?

Not on my court chump
I left the ground went up, up, up
Flew through the air like a bird, came down on his back with a mean slam dunk
Knocked him over on his rump
He hit the ground like "thump"
Now before you take your little sissy kids home
Give my chain back punk!
What?!

[Chorus]
'Cause my jumper's insane
Now watch me make it rain
When I step in the lane
You know I'm 'bout to bang
- These kids can't hang!

Because I put in work
On the court 'til it hurt
These kids coming in last
And I'm coming in first
- 'cause these kids dirt!

'Cause my jumper's insane
Now watch me make it rain
When I step in the lane
You know I'm 'bout to bang
- These kids can't hang!

Because I put in work
On the court 'til it hurt
These kids coming in last
And I'm coming in first
- 'cause these kids dirt!
