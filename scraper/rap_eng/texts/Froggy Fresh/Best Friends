[Intro]
They had Mike, and I knew it was my job to get Mike back because Mike was my best friend, and I told him that if anything ever happened to him, I would be there for him. Well, it was time for me to be a man of my word. I had to save Mike

[Verse 1]
They got Mike, we gotta get him back
Cause I told him I would always have his back
We've been friends back when we was this tall
We was making money before we could even crawl
Now they took him, I don't know what to do
But we got one rule, don't mess with the crew
It's all for one and one for all
We die for our brothers, that's how we ball
I made some calls and got some names
I heard about some guy named James
James and Mike had beef last week
Cause James ran over Mike's bike with his Jeep
I found out where James's house was
James had guns, and James sold drugs
So I knew that it was gonna be hard work
But I wasn't scared cause James is a dumb jerk

[Hook]
I said, "Mike, I'm coming for you, homie"
Cause Mike's always got my back when I'm lonely
And I always got his back when we fight
I'm coming for you, Mike, I'm a save your life
I said, "Mike, I'm coming for you, homie"
Cause Mike's always got my back when I'm lonely
And I always got his back when we fight
I'm coming for you, Mike, I'm a save your life

[Verse 2]
I got dressed in my camouflage gear
I looked to the sky, and I cried one tear
I said, "God, I hope that You're with me
And don't let me die cause Mike's gonna miss me"
So I started off towards James's house
And I was moving quiet like a mouse
I seen Mike tied up in the street
There were ropes around his hands and ropes around his feet
James ran up, and he began swinging
But he was no match for the fire I was bringing
I knocked James out with one punch
Y-yep, yep, he had a knuckle sandwich for lunch
I ran over, and I untied Mike
And then we both took off on my bike
I said, "Mike, I love you, big homie"
He said, "I'll always have your back when you're lonely"

[Hook]
