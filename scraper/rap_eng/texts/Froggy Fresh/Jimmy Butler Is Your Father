[Intro]
Froggy Fresh
And Money Maker Mike
And Gator Jones
And Jimmy Butler
This is for the Bulls

[Hook x2]
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout that man, Jimmy Butler
Put the whooping on the Cavs, they's imposters
I ain't gon' lie, LeBron, you's a baller
But Jimmy Butler is your father

[Verse 1]
The end of the 2010 season
Cav's fans nervous, cause they knew LeBron was leavin'
And he did, took his talents down to South Beach
Built that Frankenstein team and won a couple rings
Dang Cleveland, tell me what the heck is that?
First you burn the dude's jerseys then you buy him back?
LeBron left you like a hot girl in high school
Then when the Heat broke up, you took him back, fool
Do you smell that?
Something smell like desperation
But the Bulls, they been sitting back and steady, waitin'
Yeah, they been through the trials and the tribulations
Look at all the injuries Derrick's been facin'
Cleveland beggin' 'Bron to win a ring
With that brand new Frankenstein team
Give it three years, bet you if he doesn't win
Then Cleveland gonna burn his jerseys once again

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Jimmy hit 'em with that lockdown defense
LeBron twice his size, but Jimmy's straight beastin'
LeBron's stressed Jimmy gonna give him grey hair
What you talkin' 'bout, LeBron's hair ain't there
LeBron out here spraying hair out of a can
C'mon, LeBron, dude, shave your head man
Jordan shaved his head back in '89
Your hair's fallin' back, where you goin' draw the line?
And your bigs can't handle Pau in the post
You give him room, he'll pop a jumper from the free throw
And you know I love my big homie, Joakim
I ain't gon' lie, homeboy, I love the whole team
Happy Mother's Day, LeBron, hope you having fun
Happy Father's Day, Lebron, cause you're Jimmy's son
Now the Cav's all 'bout to get slaughtered
Cause Jimmy Butler is your father

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Yeah
Froggy Fresh
Money Maker Mike, Gator Jones, Jimmy Butler
And all the Bulls
Let's go, Bulls
