[Verse 1: Froggy Fresh]
Out on the court for a game of two on two
Me and Mike versus James and his boy Big Blue
We headed off to Kevin's house right after school
Cause he got that new lifetime basketball hoop
We came ready, we came ready to play
We came ready to win and bring the trophy home that day
Big Blue said you ain't bringin' home that W
How you gon' score when I'm standin' here in front of you
I grabbed the ball and I passed it into Mike
Mike caught the pass faked left and went right
He drove through the lane and he threw it off the glass
I couldn't believe my eyes he was runnin' so fast
Caught the pass in mid-air and he threw that boy down
Nobody could believe it James fell over on the ground
He started cryin' put his hands on his head
Then Big Blue looked at me and Mike, then he said

[Hook: Froggy Fresh]
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face

[Verse 2: Froggy Fresh]
James was mad, I could see it in his eyes
James never gets dunked on and James don’t ever cry
He stood up, beat his fist on his chest
Looked at me and Mike and ran his thumb across his neck
He grabbed the ball, squared up to the hoop
Took a hard right step and then he slipped in dog poop
Me and Mike started laughin' and he deserved it too
For the rest of the day we called him Captain Poopy Shoe
Then the ball bounced right over to me
Big Blue was so big I could barely even see
I took the ball and I threw it in the air
Although I couldn’t see a thing I had a feelin’ Mike was there
He grabbed the ball and did an alley-hoop dunk
Right on top of James, he made him look like a punk
Then James’ girlfriend walked by
She stopped right there and looked me square in the eye
She said

[Hook]
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face

[Verse 3: Froggy Fresh]
For the rest of the game, the lead went back and forth
It was all tied up when I checked the scoreboard
There was only 10 seconds left on the clock
James went in for a layup but his shot got blocked
And then juked out Big Blue
With the spin move, I was headed straight for the hoop
I looked at Mike, put my hand up in the air
James was standin' in the way but you know I didn’t care
Mike threw a perfect pass and I jumped so high
I was way up in the sky, dog it felt like I could fly
I grabbed the ball and I threw it down hard
Right on top of James, I felt like a superstar
That’s how me and Mike won the basketball game
We beat Big Blue and Big Bad James
Cause me and Mike are the number one team
And we heard James cry and we heard his mom scream
She said…

[Hook]
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face
Why is James cryin'
Cuz he just got dunked on
I ain’t even lyin'
Yo, he just got dunked on
Yep yep, he was standin' in the way
So I jumped up in the air and I dunked it on his face

[Outro: Froggy Fresh]
Yeah, you come up in here you’re gonna get dunked on
Peyton and Kemp
Penny and Shaq
Pippen and Jordan
Boy, me and Mike are bad
Hey!
