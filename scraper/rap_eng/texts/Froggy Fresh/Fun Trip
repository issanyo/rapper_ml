[Hook]
So long, so long
I keep thinking that my friend's gone for good
I need a shoulder I can lean on, but he's gone
And now I'm all alone, all alone

[Verse 1]
I miss Mike, I ain't seen him in a long time
I wanna high five, hear him spit a new rhyme
Last I heard, he ain't doing too fine
Cause that fun trip got him going out his mind
Fun trip is the new stuff James been dealing
One lil hit got you bouncing off the ceiling
Now James got my homeboy hooked
The way it's messing Mike up got me shook
All the clothes and the whips and the clips
And the guns and the money and the drugs
And the honeys and the thugs
The same guys he said he would never run with
But now he's addicted to the fun trip
Thing is, Mike really ain't a bad guy
He was doing bad things just to get a quick high
He got a taste to the money and the power
Ain't no high like that soft blue powder

[Hook]
So long, so long
I keep thinking that my friend's gone for good
I need a shoulder I can lean on, but he's gone
And now I'm all alone, all alone

[Verse 2]
I seen Mike and James out in the streets
Boom box on his shoulder, head bopping to the beat
I said "Steve, what's up homie"
He said "Yo dog, long time no see"
I said "Steve, why you running around with James?
You know that life is only gonna bring you pain"
He said "Cause James gets the trip at a low price
Buddy you're just jealous I'm living the good life"
I said "The good life, Steve, this isn't it
That stuff ain't good for you Steve, you gotta quit"
He said "Get out my face before I hit you in the lip"
But that wasn't Mike talking, no way, that was the trip
I watched him drive away with James
In the whip with the clips and them big gold chains
I knew with James, he would probably make a million
But that fun trip, it was gonna kill him

[Hook]
So long, so long
I keep thinking that my friend's gone for good
I need a shoulder I can lean on, but he's gone
And now I'm all alone, all alone

[Verse 3]
Days went past, weeks went past
I knew he wouldn't last, things are moving too fast
I called and called but I never got through
It's like I want to do something but I don't know what to do
How could you go and throw it all away
I don't know what to say, you got me worried every day
Worried about if you gonna make it through the night
And all that I could do is watch it take over your life
That stuff is gonna crush you, I hate you and I love you
Think about how your momma's looking down from above you
Think about what she'd think Mike, think about what she'd feel
I can't believe this is happening, I can't believe it's real
I can't believe there's nothing I can do to bring him back
I can't believe it Mike, I gave you everything I have
We made a promise to each other, one brother to another
We'd never leave each other, we put that on our mothers

[Hook]
So long, so long
I keep thinking that my friend's gone for good
I need a shoulder I can lean on, but he's gone
And now I'm all alone, all alone
