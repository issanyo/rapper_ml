[Verse 1: Froggy Fresh]
Fun trip got these streets feelin' so hard
I been through big wheels, skateboards, and go-karts
Just to get my hands on these bikes
See, what's a man without his bike?
That's a man without his life
And these kids don't deserve this
So I think it's time for me and Mike
To do some public service
Time to show James, "Crime Don't Pay"
Time to show James me and Mike don't play
We've been waitin' for this day all summer
No more James callin' us Dumb & Dumber
When I see that fool
I'ma hit him with the stunner
Strike like lightning
Rumble like thunder
They can't handle me, son
I'm The Dragon
I revved up the engine
Mike jumped in the wagon
Then we headed off to old Mr. Kane's
Bumpin' Dr. Dre bout to wreck James' day

[Chorus]
Can we get them bicycles back?
Cause them little kids they ain't got no bikes
Can we get them bicycles back?
Cause them little kids
They ain't got no bikes to ride
Can we get them bicycles back?
Cause them little kids they ain't got no bikes
Can we get them bicycles back?
Cause them little kids
They ain't got no bikes to ride

[Verse 2: Froggy Fresh]
Slick, that's what they call me when they call me
I slipped behind a car but then a couple ninjas saw me
Good thing Mike was right there to have my back
He snuck up from behind them and he started to attack
Then outta nowhere up walked Vinnie Velvet
Got his hair permed out had it lookin' like a helmet
He walked toward me with a clenched fist
And a big ol' stick that I was bout to get hit with
Was it fate or was it just dumb luck?
Cause I looked over and I saw a pair of nunchuks
But I didn't know exactly how to use 'em
I started swinging them around and accidentally threw 'em
Then they nailed Vinnie Velvet in the head
He fell over on the ground
I was scared that he was dead
I didn't have no time to worry bout that
I had to get them bikes out that shed ASAP

[Chorus]
Can we get them bicycles back?
Cause them little kids they ain't got no bikes
Can we get them bicycles back?
Cause them little kids
They ain't got no bikes to ride
Can we get them bicycles back?
Cause them little kids they ain't got no bikes
Can we get them bicycles back?
Cause them little kids
They ain't got no bikes to ride

[Verse 3: Froggy Fresh]
As I walked up ahead
James was waitin' at the shed
Slashed a garden tool against my chest
That had me spillin' red
But dawg, I ain't afraid of blood
(In) fact, I love the taste of it
Little baby garden tool
I wasn't afraid of it
I sat back and I waited like a cat
When I seen him relax
And I went in for the attack
Hit him with that dragon kick and laid him on his back
He was out cold so I knew it was a wrap
I jogged over to him grabbed the keys out of his pants
Took a second to do the fish-out-of-water dance
A ninja kick to get the bikes back
Imagine that, it took three tries
But we're finally the champs
I walked up to the shed with the keys inside my hand
Me and Mike had saved the day, I was feelin' like the man
Things were lookin' up
Me and Mike were on the right track
And most importantly
We finally got the bikes back

[Chorus] X 2
Can we get them bicycles back?
Cause them little kids they ain't got no bikes
Can we get them bicycles back?
Cause them little kids
They ain't got no bikes to ride

What what
