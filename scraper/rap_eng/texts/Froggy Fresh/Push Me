[Verse 1]
I had a dream that my best friend died
He was laying on the couch as he closed both of his eyes
And I just sat and stared ahead trying not to cry
And all that I could say was "I tried mama, I tried"
And when I walked on over to him to pay my last respects
He opened up his eyes like he had risen from the dead
He said "Why didn't you save me? Why didn't you take me
And bring me home and get me clean? Why didn't you make me?"
What could I say to that? I couldn't say a thing
I seen all the pain inside his eyes, I could've stopped that pain
I could've grabbed him by his collar, dragged him through the streets
And kept him locked up all alone inside a room for weeks
If I loved Mike, that's exactly what I would've done
If I loved him like a brother, if I loved him like a son
I'da gave my own life, just to save his
Without the love of another man an addict can't quit

[Chorus: Megan Davies]
Push me over the edge now, to the place where demons lay, yeah
Push me over the edge now, only one step away
Push me over the edge now, to the place where demons lay, yeah
Push me over the edge now, only one step away

[Verse 2]
I'm not a coward, I've never been afraid
In fact I can't even wait until I see my last day
But as long as I'm alive, if my friend ain't by my side
There ain't no doubt inside my twisted mind that I would rather die
And what is life, what is life without someone to love?
Without someone to stand by, without someone to hug?
It ain't nothing, it ain't nothing worth living
I wish that I could say it was, but it just isn't
I left the house with one thought on my mind
No matter what it takes I ain't gon leave my friend behind
I gotta save his life, even if I lose my own
I don't wanna be alone, I just gotta bring him home
I grabbed my bike and rode it straight across town
Heard everybody whispering "It's bout to go down"
I pulled up to the house but there was men blocking the door
I reached behind my back and said "Lucky I brought my sword"

[Chorus: Megan Davies]
Push me over the edge now, to the place where demons lay, yeah
Push me over the edge now, only one step away
Push me over the edge now, to the place where demons lay, yeah
Push me over the edge now, only one step away

[Verse 3]
I made my way into the house, Mike was laying on the couch
I could still see the blue powder all around his mouth
James ran into the room, bullets fired from his clip
But I didn't get hit, because I deflected em quick
James threw the gun and I cut the gun in half
And when he turned to run I ran the sword across his calf
He fell down on the floor, I said "Lay there, and stay there!
These things you do to me and Mike, James, you know it ain't fair!
You're lucky I don't kill you right here, right now
If you don't wanna die today you better stay down on the ground!"
I grabbed Mike by his shirt, made sure he wasn't hurt
Mike weighed more than me, but it was time to put in work
I threw him in the wagon, brought him back to the crib
I locked him in a room and said "Mike, you're gonna live!"
Withdrawal's the most painful thing I had ever seen
But in less than two weeks I had my homeboy clean

[Chorus: Megan Davies]
Push me over the edge now, to the place where demons lay, yeah
Push me over the edge now, only one step away
Push me over the edge now, to the place where demons lay, yeah
Push me over the edge now, only one step away
