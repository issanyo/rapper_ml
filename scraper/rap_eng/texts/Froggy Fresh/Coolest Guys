The coolest guys around the town
Everybody come and gather around
Me and Mike are here to stay
We make these rap songs every day
The coolest guys around the town
Everybody come and gather around
Me and Mike are here to stay
We make these rap songs every day

[Verse 1]
You're mad cause your girlfriend wants to hold my hand
I could go like this and hit you with a rubber band
Now I think I'll go and ask your girlfriend on a date
I'll pick her up at seven, and I won't be late
And then I'll probably blow her a kiss
Have you ever seen me do it? It goes like this
Kiss your hand, and blow the kiss away
She maybe didn't tell you, but I kiss her every day
I learned this move in my karate class
Try and pay attention cause I'm gonna do it fast
Right punch, left punch, kick, and spin
Now go home and practice, and show it to your friends
I can run one mile in seven minutes flat
I even got a ribbon; I bet you like that
It's a first place ribbon; that's why it's blue
If you go home and practice, you can get one, too

Everybody come and gather around
Me and Mike are here to stay

The coolest guys around the town
Everybody come and gather around
Me and Mike are here to stay
We make these rap songs every day

[Verse 2]
I could shoot a shot as good as Michael Jordan
My favorite NBA player is Michael Jordan
My other favorite NBA player is Kobe Bryant
When he jumps in the air, he goes flyin'
Someday I want to rap like Eminem
"Lose Yourself" is my favorite song by Eminem
You can even ask Mike--I know all of the words
It's probably the best song that I've ever heard
Everybody knows that I have no fear
And guess what? Last year I caught three deer
So what do you think about that
My name is Krispy Kreme, and I really like to rap
And I know how to cook some real good chicken
Have you ever tried it? That stuff is finger lickin'
It's so darn good; it tastes so sweet
I like to eat chicken every single week

The coolest guys around the town

Me and Mike are here to stay
We make these rap songs every day

Peace!
