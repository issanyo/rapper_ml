[Verse 1]
As soon as I take a step inside the club
I run up to my boys and my homies show me love
Cuz you know how we do, we always go hard
I'll die for my boys before I ever let 'em starve

We always eat good, cuz we work so hard
We grind so hard. We've come so far
We will not stop. We will not quit
When they count us out, we 'gon drop another hit

I said I see you on that dance floor, just do it
I wanna see you dance more, just move it
Glide and slide from side to side
Dance, just dance, just dance away the night

[Hook: 2X]
Ooooh, girl work it. Work that thing
I'm bout to make it rain, cuz you're driving me insane
I like the way you move, I like the way you groove
Get out on that dance floor, girl your so smooth, I said

[Verse 2]
If you want girl, we can leave the club soon
Go out to the beach, dance underneath the moon
Girl watcha think, do you wanna be my wife?
Don't make me ask twice, cuz I love you more than life

Can't no other girl shake it like you
I really can't wait girl I wanna wife you
Check out that ring girl, put it on your finger
I'll sing you a song cuz I'm a real good singer

And I'll just sit here and watch you dance
Run across the beach while I hold your hand
I'll spin you around girl, let's get down girl
You always make me smile girl, you never make me frown

[Hook: 2X]

[Verse 3]
2X:
Pretty little thing from Tennessee, I like you and you like me
Girl I wanna give you my heart they can't keep us apart
Pretty little thing from Tennessee, I like you and you like me
Girl I wanna give you my time, can't get you off my mind

You ain't gonna find another man like me
Another girl like you, that's unlikely
Cuz we're one of a kind, I wanna give you all my time
No matter how hard I try, I can't get you outta my mind

[Hook: 2X]

[Bridge:]
Krispy Kreme . . . and Money Maker Mike. Back with another hit
A song for the ladies. You ready?

[Hook: 2X]

Peace Out
