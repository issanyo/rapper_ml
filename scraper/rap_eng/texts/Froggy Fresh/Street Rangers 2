[Hook: Froggy Fresh]
Oohhh!

Cause I'm out here in these streets
I am broken, I am beat
But this has to end tonight
I gotta go save young Rob's life

Cause I'm a million miles from home
I can't do this on my own
Cause you know things ain't always sweet
When you out here in these streets

[Verse 1: Froggy Fresh]
James hanging at the school
Hand full of dynamite, acting like a fool
Strapped up to that poor boy, young Rob
For the street rangers, that's a piece of cake job

James said they was gonna 'splode the playground
When you're in my town, we don't like the play 'round
Got a call from the sheriff, said he don't know what to do
I told him dear sheriff, you done called the right crew

We're gonna save young Rob, and defuse the bomb
And send that punk James home crying to his mom
I called up Gator, I called up Mike
They ran over to my house quicker than the speed of light

I said look guys, this is our time
That dumb jerk James done lost his dang mind
He's got young Rob hostage at the school
Yo it's morphing time, lets annihilate this fool

[Hook: Froggy Fresh]

[Verse 2: Froggy Fresh]
But my morpher wouldn't morph
I made a fake one cause they were sold out at the store
Mike started laughing, I said shut up stupid jerk
Let me use your morpher, mine doesn't even work

Mike said bro, this is for the red ranger
Just meet us at the school, come on let's go Gator
I said for real, you're really gonna leave?
Man I can't believe this, yo I thought we were a team

Gator said bro, look we gotta go
If we don't hurry up the playground is gonna blow
I said fine, I guess you're not my friends
Neither of you guys can ever come over again

Mike said fine, hurry up dude
Run into the house and go and change into your suit
I said good, you guys are still my friends
Street rangers gotta stay united to the end

[Hook: Froggy Fresh]

[Verse 3: Froggy Fresh]
I changed in 20 minutes flat
When the town needs your help, boy you gotta act fast
But when I came out, Mike and Gator were gone
They left me a note that said I took too long

They made it to the school, just in the nick of time
But it doesn't really matter cause they left their friend behind
But anyways I'm over that now, it doesn't matter
Out of all three of us, I'm still the better rapper

They're just jerks and they didn't even wait
I guess having friends isn't all that great
Cause they'll turn their back on you, every single time
When your morpher doesn't morph and they have to fight crime

Moral of the story is don't trust friends
Street rangers never stay together to the end
Oh by the way, Mike and Gator saved the day
Without the blue ranger, so yeah, hooray
