[Verse 1]
It was going on ten , Friday - the weekend
Me and Mike was up late, parents were sleepin'
Up to no good, me and Mike was sneakin'
Peeping through the phone-book prank call creepin'

We flipped the page, we picked a name
Some guy from Otisville, named Gary Wayne
We dialed the numbers, we let it ring
He said: "Hello", I said: "What's up man?
You know who this is?" Gary said: "No"
I said: "I'm the guy who tried to eat your pinky toe
Remember me? Prob'ly not
Oh yeah, one more thing: "

[Chorus]
You just just got prank-called!
Yup, this was all a joke
Prank-called?
I swear we never even spoke!
You just got prank-called!
You just got prank-called little cousin'
You thought it was a real call, but it wasn't!
Ringadingdong!

Random attack on an innocent citizen
Is your fridge runnin'? - Well you better catch it then!
Up late at night hangin' with my bros
If you get a call from me you better know:

You prob'ly gon' get prank-called
Yup, this was all a joke
Prank-called?
I swear we never even spoke!
You just got prank-called!
You just got prank-called little cousin'
You thought it was a real call, but it wasn't!
Ringadingdong!

[Verse 2]
Then he dared me, he triple dog dared me
The only number in the phone-book that could scare me
9-1-1 - the number for the police
I had to do it, had to do it for the streets

So I dialed it, 9-1-1
It was silent for a second, but then the phone rung
It only rang once, but it felt like an eternity
Then I heard: "9-1-1, what's your emergency?"
I had to do something real cool (Why?)
To show Mike that I was hard-core
So I said: "somebody call 9-1-1
'cause you're the fire burning on the dance floor!"

[Chorus]
You just just got prank-called!
Yup, this was all a joke
Prank-called?
I swear we never even spoke!
You just got prank-called!
You just got prank-called little cousin'
You thought it was a real call, but it wasn't!
Ringadingdong!

Random attack on an innocent citizen
Is your fridge runnin'? - Well you better catch it then!
Up late at night hangin' with my bros
If you get a call from me you better know:

You prob'ly gon' get prank-called
Yup, this was all a joke
Prank-called?
I swear we never even spoke!
You just got prank-called!
You just got prank-called little cousin'
You thought it was a real call, but it wasn't!
Ringadingdong!

[Verse 3]
I messed up - real bad!
I could tell that cop - he was real mad
The phone rang - who could it be?
It had to be the cops - looking for me!

I answered, they said "it's the cops
Do you think it's cool to do prank-calls a lot?
Well, guess what? Now you're going to jail
You're getting locked up for 'bout a decade, tell"

I started crying, I was super scared
I started screaming out: "Yo this isn't fair!"
The cop was laughing at me, then he said: "oh yeah
And one more thing" (What?!)

[Chorus]
You just just got prank-called!
Yup, this was all a joke
Prank-called?
I swear we never even spoke!
You just got prank-called!
You just got prank-called little cousin'
You thought it was a real call, but it wasn't!
Ringadingdong!

Random attack on an innocent citizen

Prank-called?

You just got prank-called!

You thought it was a real call, but it wasn't!
Ringadingdong!
