[Verse 1]
It was me and Mike in our hometown
We were hangin' out, playin' on the playground
We were runnin' round, doin' our thing
Then up walked James and his gang
We said "Hey, we don't want any trouble"
And James said "Well, I hate to burst your bubble
But you're about to get your butt kicked bad
You're bout to get shot, you're bout to get stabbed"
Then James sent two of his guys
We punched them in the eye and they both began to cry
Mike said "James, you better back up
You keep talkin' smack, you gon' get smacked up"
James said "Go, attack right now"
The situation turned into a real fight now
Two vs two, we're the two man crew
Yeah it's true cause we stick together just like glue

[Hook]
It's a fight to the finish, a battle to the death
The only one who leaves is the last man left
We're the toughest of the tough, we're the best of the best
We're the best and we're better than the rest
It's a fight to the finish, a battle to the death
The only one who leaves is the last man left
We're the toughest of the tough, we're the best of the best
We're the best and we're better than the rest

[Verse 2]
Bulldog chased me to the top of the slide
I kicked him off the side,everybody thought he died
But he didn't cause he never does
Bulldog is the toughest bad guy that there ever was
Mike was fighting like he never fought before
He punched Snake Eyes and he knocked him on the floor
But Snake Eyes is a crafty little guy
He grabbed Mike's leg and he stabbed him in the thigh
Mike pulled out the knife, he was fightin' for his life
Then Bulldog shot me in the left arm twice
It felt like a spike, I ran over to Mike
I looked at Bulldog and said "You better take a hike"
Me and Mike locked arms and we started spinnin' round
To the average human being we looked like a couple clowns
But me and Mike both knew what to do
Them punks came runnin' and they both went boom

[Hook]
Its a fight to the finish, a battle to the death
The only one who leaves is the last man left
We're the toughest of the tough, we're the best of the best
We're the best and we're better than the rest
It's a fight to the finish, a battle to the death
The only one who leaves is the last man left
We're the toughest of the tough, we're the best of the best
We're the best and we're better than the rest
