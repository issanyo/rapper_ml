[Chorus]
Oh my God! Homeboy you just got dunked on!
Oh my! Good lord! You just got your bell rung
Oh my God! Homeboy you just got dunked on!
Oh my God! Good God! Good Lord! Good God! He just got dunked on!

[Verse 1]
Game one of the driveway championship
James and Big Blue? - Well they might as well up and quit
'cause me and Mike got our eyes on that big gold Larry O'Brien
Part of the line, 'bout to send them home cryin'

Mike shot for ball
Do or die
All net, our ball
That was easy as pie
A couple years passed by
Me and Mike done developed
So I grabbed a big ball and told Big Blue: Checkup

Then I told Big Blue
Guess what I'm about to do
I'ma tell you what I'm 'bout to do then I'ma do it too
I'ma pump-fake then I'ma blow on by
And when James steps up I show him how I can fly (Haha!)

Pump-faked then I drove the baseline
And served James up a hot plate of fake time (uh-oh!)
I told James: "Yo, I'm ready for flight
So get up 'cause it's gonn' be a long night, sucka"

[Bridge]
Like a 747, like a jet plane
When I'm flying through the air I let my feet hang
When I take off from the ground, everybody stands around
And they stop and they stare because it's sweet man
Like a helium balloon, like a spaceship
Me and Mike, yo we ain't the type to play with
Then Mike left the ground
'bout tore the hoop down
Turned around and I heard him say:

[Chorus]
Oh my God! Homeboy you just got dunked on!
Oh my good Lord! You just got your bell rung
Oh my God! Homeboy you just got dunked on!
Oh my God! Good God! Good Lord! Good God! He just got dunked on!

[Verse 2]
My lagged out D will leave you shakin'
MJ mixed with a little Gary Payton
Big Blue got fancy, then he got that ball ripped
I told him go work on your handles young pimp

Mike out the ballin' like he was Mello
Hit James with that jabstep, turned him into jello
Then Big Blue tried to step up in the paint
But my homeboy Mike ran him over like a tank (And one!)

When I looked at coach Phil I could tell he was proud
Me and Mike was balling hard and the crowd was cheering loud
And James and Big Blue was tryin' get back in the game
But they were getting dusted, wonder why they even came
'Cause man them young cat's was laying bricks
When I checked the scoreboard it was thirty eight to six (Dang!)

But what did you expect? Homie when was you born?
When you mess with the bulls you best believe you get the horns

[Bridge]
Like a 747, like a jet plane
When I'm flying through the air I let my feet hang
When I take off from the ground, everybody stands around
And they stop and they stare because it's sweet man
Like a helium balloon, like a spaceship
Me and Mike, yo we ain't the type to play with
Then I left the ground
'bout tore the hoop down
Turned around and they heard me say:

[Chorus]
Oh my God! Homeboy you just got dunked on!
Oh my good Lord! You just got your bell rung
Oh my God! Homeboy you just got dunked on!
Oh my God! Good God! Good Lord! Good God! He just got dunked on!

[Verse 3]
It was a blowout, it wasn't even close now
It was time to show out, they like it when I throw down
I tossed the oop to Mike, right before the buzzer
He threw it down and told James: "That was for your mother"

James got mad 'cause his team had lost bad
He walked up to Mike an threw a jab with everything he had (Pow!)
Mike stumbled and he landed on his back
And just like that coach Phil snapped
-it was on!

You could see it in his eyes: he was ready to kill
He threw an uppercut and coach Phil hit him in the grill
And James head snapped back hard, he went flyin' 'cross the court
And he landed in the yard (oh!)

Then I said: "coach Phil, dawg you crazy"
Coach Phil replied: "I ain't about to let this young punk play me"
Cops showed up and coach Phil ran
I just stood there shaking my head like "oh man"

[Bridge]
Coach Phil took off running to the backyard
Then the cop jumped out of his cop-car
Coach Phil is kinda fat and the cop was really fast
So we knew he wasn't gonna make it that far
They were both jumpin' over all the fences
Coach Phil didn't wanna get sentenced
Then the cop came around and he slammed him on the ground like a clown and we heard him say:

[Chorus]
Oh my God! Homeboy you just got dunked on!
Oh my good Lord! You just got your bell rung
Oh my God! Homeboy you just got dunked on!
Oh my God! Good God! Good Lord! Good God! He just got dunked on!
