[Intro: Froggy Fresh]
It was Halloween.
Me and Mike decided to stay home this year.
After the lightsaber battle with Michael Myers,
We decided that it was best not to go out,
So we just rented some scary movies and some video games.
I was smoking Mike in Hangtime, over and over.
He got really mad, so we started fighting.
Big mistake; I put him in the sleeper hold again.
He was out cold in under ten seconds.
Will he ever learn?
When he woke up, we decided to just play Madden.
We had to stay up all night,
Because this guy named Farty Krueger has been haunting our dreams
You never heard of Farty Krueger?
Well you're about to learn all about him.
