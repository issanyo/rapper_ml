Farty please, would you just quit bother me?
I wanna go to sleep, but I don't wanna die tonight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Farty please, would you just quit bother me?
I wanna go to sleep, but I don't wanna die tonight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 1]
It was gettin' late like a quarter past 8
Me and Mike are playin' Madden for like 20 hours straight
I was gettin' tired, Mike was gettin' tired
Couldn't keep my eyes open, they felt like they were on fire
We couldn't go to sleep cause when we go to sleep
There's a man named Farty Krueger that we always meet
Come on man, you have heard of Farty?
Whenever you're asleep, Farty Kreuger likes to party
He's scary and his breathe smells like cat poop
And worst of all, he has a Jonas Brothers tattoo
Farty what heck were you thinkin'?
That was the worst idea since Farty Vs Jason
I say "Mike, bro we gotta stay awake"
"Look I'm still a virgin, I don't wanna die today"
"Just keep your eyes open till the sun comes up"
Soon as I finished talkin', both my eyes closed shut

[Hook]
Farty please, would you just quit bother me?
I wanna go to sleep, but I don't wanna die tonight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Farty please, would you just quit bother me?
I wanna go to sleep, but I don't wanna die tonight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
When we looked at the ground, there was fog on our feet
That's a sure sign that me and Mike have feel asleep
We was scared as heck, we was scared to death
We couldn't see Farty yet, but we could smell his breath
We walked to the kitchen and then I peed my pants
Sometimes I can't hold it on and other times I can
I told Mike "you better not tell nobody at school
"Or I'm gon' tell 'em how you pooped inside the pool"
Yo fam, I didn't know where came Farty
Silverware on his fingers and his breath was smellin' gnarly
Mike said "Farty, why's your sweater's red and green?"
"It's not Christmas home boy it's Halloween"
Farty said "Mike, you don't like my sweater, huh?"
"You haven't washed that Mac Miller shirt in like 9 months"
This is an event you gon' wanna stay for
Cause we's gon' about to have ourselves a little blaze war

[Hook]
Farty please, would you just quit bother me?
I wanna go to sleep, but I don't wanna die tonight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Farty please, would you just quit bother me?
I wanna go to sleep, but I don't wanna die tonight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 3]
I said "Mike, go look at his ghetto ripped glove"
"There's a fork on his finger and a spoon on his thumb"
I said, "oh my god, yo I got it, Mike check his"
"Farty Krueger: part of this compete breakfast"
Farty said "you're gonna make fun of me?"
"Home boy, why you got that NSYNC CD?"
I said "That's right, and I got it on tape"
"How could anybody not like Justin Timberlake?"
He said "Little man, all the girls love me"
"But they don't like you cause you're short and your're ugly"
I said "Farty, you ain't nothin' to admire"
"Lookin' like Edward Scissor hands caught on fire"
I didn't know Ed was right here
He just kept on lookin' at me with his big man stare
I said "relax Eddy, we can talk about this later"
"Why don't you head into the livin' room and cut yourself some paper?"
