[Hook]
I've been waiting for these gifts, I've been waiting all year long
But when I woke up to sneak a peek, all the presents were all gone
Now I ain't one to make a fuss but Christmas ain't the same
With that old boy James, James, James playing reindeer games

[Verse 1]
It was the night before Christmas, me and Mike couldn't sleep
We stayed up guessing about our presents cause we weren't allowed to peek
But we ain't very patient and we couldn't wait no more
I felt the cool winter chill as my feet hit the floor
We opened up the door and we walked down the hall
But there wasn't any presents, there were no presents at all
I looked over and Mike just started crying
I put my hand on his shoulder and said "It's gonna be fine!"
Don't worry Mike, we're gonna figure this out
We're gonna get the presents back, that's what Christmas is about
See, without present man, Christmas ain't the same"
Mike looked over at me and said "It's gotta be James"
I said "You're right, I should have known
In the middle of the night, he must have broke into our home"
Mike said "Yo, he could be anywhere in town"
I said "I know but we gotta track him down"

[Verse 2]
Me and Mike headed out on that cold winter night
With the snow shining bright underneath the moonlight
We drew James very best that we could
Taped him up to all the telephone poles in the hood
We stopped at the stores, taped his pictures to doors
It was the middle of the night and we was going on four
Me and Mike was getting cold, the trail was getting cold
By now, our gifts have been sold or resold
The sun came up, we been searching all night
We searched left, we searched right, it wasn't anywhere in sight
We was getting tired, we was bout to call it quits
Then all of a sudden we got an anonymous tip
The caller said "I see him in the woods behind the school
Hurry cause I think he's got your parents with him too"
Me and Mike headed off to the woods in a rush
We couldn't believe it but sure enough, there he was

[Verse 3]
Mike fired the sling shot and hit him in the butt cheek
James dropped to his knees and let out a loud shriek
He was dragging a big bag that Big Blue couldn't even lift
Me and Mike ran up and said "Why did you steal our gifts?"
James said "Sorry guys, money's been tight
Winter's been so cold, there ain't nobody riding bikes
When nobody's riding bikes man, there's no bikes to steal
I been going to church to get a nice hot meal"
Mike said "Shut up, James, give us back our presents
I looked at Mike and said "Dog, chill, just wait a second
James is clearly broke and we got a lot of gifts
It ain't gon' kill us just to give him five or six
Then James said "Hey guys, how bout this
I ain't keeping five or six, I'm keeping all your freaking gifts
I pulled my sword out, I was all ready for war
James pulled his magnum out, said "gun beats sword"
