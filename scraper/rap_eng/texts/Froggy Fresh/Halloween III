[Intro]
It was Halloween night me and Mike had just got done trick or treating. We were supposed to be asleep but we don't play by the rules. That's when we heard the doorbell. We got up to see what was going on. We opened the door it was Michael Myers, Farty Krueger, and Jason. They challenged us to a game of driveway basketball. If we win Michael Myers said he would never bother us again, but if me and Mike lost, well they said they would kill us. Plus they would get my driveway championship trophy. Yeah, right, I knew we would win so I accepted the challenge. Game on you stupid losers

[Verse 1: Froggy Fresh]
I swear these stupid goons play ball like 5th graders
Backed Freddy down then I turned and hit a mean fader
Freddy don't you know you're supposed to dribble with one hand
He kept dribbling with two, I don't think he understands
Michael Myers get that robot arm under control
If you keep dribbling like that then the ball is gonna 'splode
Also when we're finished can you change my tires bro?
"I'm not a dang mechanic I just wear mechanic clothes!"
Jason put away your hockey stick this isn't hockey
And you should never dribble bro your handle's looking sloppy
Your defense is non-existent you ain't gonna stop me
I play this game like pianos get played by Liberace
I crossed him and I crippled him both his knees were blown
Tore his ACL, his MCL, and even broke his toes
Broke his tibia, his fibula, and both his femur bones
Mike said dang bro you got them legs like Derrick Rose

[Hook]
These bad guys want to play me in some hoop
But everybody know you guys are poop
Cause you can't dribble and you can't shoot
Me and my homeboy Mike about to wreck your whole crew
These bad guys want to play me in some hoop
But everybody know you guys are poop
Cause you can't dribble and you can't shoot
Me and my homeboy Mike about to wreck your whole crew

[Verse 2: Froggy Fresh]
Dang Jason guess your jump shot is on vacation
You got the worst Jumper in the nation
I heard Freddy laugh, I said is something funny man?
Jason's jumper's wack but your jumper's twice as bad
Here maybe you can make it in this
I held up a hula hoop and then I blew him a kiss
He was ticked he stepped to me and he put up his fist
That's when I cracked that jab out and busted him in the lips
Grabbed his nips real hard then I started the twist
Then he tried to step away but then I stepped on his Kicks
I had such a good grip that his nips wouldn't slip
He was falling backwards, thought his nipples would rip
Then I let him go and he fell on the ground
He was screaming real loud, he was rolling around
I said Freddy did you like that titty twister Mayne?
"That ain't a titty twister that's a titty hurricane"

[Hook]
These bad guys want to play me in some hoop
But everybody know you guys are poop
Cause you can't dribble and you can't shoot
Me and my homeboy Mike about to wreck your whole crew
These bad guys want to play me in some hoop
But everybody know you guys are poop
Cause you can't dribble and you can't shoot
Me and my homeboy Mike about to wreck your whole crew
[Verse 3: Froggy Fresh]
We had 50 on the board, the bad guys hadn't scored
Freddy said it's only cause his nips were super sore
Michael Myers agreed, I said guys please
Then Michael Myers said that me and Mike were too mean
So I started calling Michael Myers Michael Cryers
Come and cry on me because my jumper is on fire
Freddy said "come on guys we got to make a come back"
Then Mike said the game is over censored
Jason called Mike McLovin then he got hit with the pumpkin
Then Mike walked over and pumped him and told that goon to do something
But Jason wouldn't do nothing because he soft as a muffin
Then Freddy went in to dunk it but Mike jumped up and he stuffed him
Them bad guys think they're so tough but we beat them 50 to nothing
Then Michael Myers got rough and then me and him started tussling, scuffling
Then I punched him in the stomach, he's stumbling
"Then what?" Then I Superman kicked him and crumbled him

[Hook]
These bad guys want to play me in some hoop
But everybody know you guys are poop
Cause you can't dribble and you can't shoot
Me and my homeboy Mike about to wreck your whole crew
These bad guys want to play me in some hoop
But everybody know you guys are poop
Cause you can't dribble and you can't shoot
Me and my homeboy Mike about to wreck your whole crew

[Outro]
