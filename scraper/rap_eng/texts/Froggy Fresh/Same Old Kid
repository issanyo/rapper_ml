[Verse 1]
You could love me you could hate me
But you won't ever break me
I shall not fear a thing for my Dear Lord will not forsake me
Persecute me, boy you could shoot me homie
You could stone me
You could lock me up in solitary, all I know is lonely
All I know is work, all I know is hurt, all I know is pain
All I know is rainy days, all I know is chains
It's me and Mike, it doesn't matter what our name is
You can't take away our dreams and we got dreams of being famous
I done seen too many souls become a victim of the system
Either wind up flippin' burgers or they're packed inside a prison
I don't want it, I don't want that for my fam
Something we cannot stand
We will scrape and crawl into our promised land
They do not know me, therefore they cannot hold me
Watch me break into the upper class and bring all of my homies
Cause you're my brothers and I love you as I do myself
I put that on my health, what is wealth without a commonwealth

[Hook]
I'm Froggy Fresh and I ain't gon' rest
Ain't gonna stop until you pull this heart out of my chest
On the same old street in the same old crib
Yeah the name done changed, but I'm the same old kid
Screamin' I'm Froggy Fresh and I ain't gon' rest
Ain't gonna stop until you pull this heart out of my chest
On the same old street in the same old crib
Yeah the name done changed, but I'm the same old kid

[Verse 2]
They cannot stop us because we are a movement
Whether you are my brother or some kid I went to school with
Dog I ain't no would-be, they're scared and they should be
Yes now they are afraid of the idea of what we could be
We will be, boy you could cut my tongue out, you could kill me
But you won't ever ever stop the spirit that does fill me
Cause love don't ever die, I thought you knew by now
You stop our breath, you dig a grave, and put us in the ground
I just hope that when I go, I go out with a smile
Proud as they stack me and my homies in a pile
And I will pass away as I have done before
It only took me 'til the age of 9 to learn that life's a war
And I can't even lie, you don't want it, you know why
Cause when you look me in the eye you know I ain't afraid to die
Cause there's victory in death long as you die for something great
If death is what it takes for me to win then I won't stay

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And they won't ever tell you, but they hate to see you make it
And as soon as you get something for yourself they wanna take it
Well go on, you can have it, I'll look away while you grab it
Boy I don't need no stacks and I don't need no baller status
Ain't no power in the dollar, but the power's in the people
Cause our wallets ain't the same don't mean we ain't created equal
I don't need for you to clap, I don't need for you to cheer
I just hope that when I speak that there's somebody there to hear
And I don't need no castle, cause every castle crumbles
I know that I'm gon' stumble, I just hope that I die humble
I hope that I stay down to earth and grounded
Because my fortress is the human race by which I am surrounded
I hope you love me, I hope you love me
I hope to God that there's a heaven up above me
I see the beauty, the beauty in what we could be
So my dear brothers let us all be what we should be

[Hook]
