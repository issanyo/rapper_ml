We're street rangers, who can you call
When your back is up against a wall
Street rangers, we will unite
We will turn the darkness into light
We're street rangers, who can you call
When your back is up against a wall
Street rangers, we will unite
We will turn the darkness into light

[Verse 1]
Walking around bout half a block from where I live
That fool Predator was picking on some little kid
He took his ice cream and smashed it on the ground
It was up to me and Mike, we had to protect our town
I said "Predator, bro that isn't cool
Look at that kid man, he's only in middle school
Predator said "Shut your mouth boy, these streets are mine"
I looked over at Mike and said "Dog, it's morphing time"

We're street rangers, who can you call
When your back is up against a wall
Street rangers, we will unite
We will turn the darkness into light

[Verse 2]
The fight raged on, my strength was all gone
I said "Mike, this is taking way too long
I'm getting hungry bro, I gotta be home at 8
Mom is making tator tots, bro I can't be late
Plus this suit, bro this suit is so tight
Look at this thing, I can barely even breathe Mike
I'm sorry homie, but I'm going back home
This dude ain't even tough, you can fight this guy alone"

We will turn the darkness into light
