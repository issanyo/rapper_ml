[Chorus: Froggy Fresh]
I said tonight we gonna be sleeping in the tent
So grab a sleeping bag a pillow and a friend
We're gonna do it, it's gonna be awesome
With good times a friendship can blossom
I said tonight we gonna be sleeping in the tent
So grab a sleeping bag a pillow and a friend
We're gonna do it, it's gonna be awesome
With good times a friendship can blossom

[Verse 1: Froggy Fresh]
I said tonight we gonna be sleeping in the tent
Me, Money Maker Mike, Todd and Crazy Chris
We had our sleeping bags and a whole bunch of snacks
Had my sword on my back in case we had to attack
You never know who could be lurking in the backyard
Plus i'm hard so they made me the security guard
I set my sword down and said attention everyone
This is for protection, this is not for fun
Chris grabbed my sword and started swinging it around
I told him Crazy Chris boy you gotta settle down
Todd tried to sneak up on Chris like a dummy
And Chris swung the sword put it through Todd's tummy
Todd fell to his knees, then he looked at me
Then Crazy Chris said "Todd now your soul is free"
Then Todd fell over on his back Chris started to laugh
Todd's eyes rolled back then he passed

[Chorus: Froggy Fresh]
I said tonight we gonna be sleeping in the tent
So grab a sleeping bag a pillow and a friend
We're gonna do it, it's gonna be awesome
With good times a friendship can blossom
I said tonight we gonna be sleeping in the tent
So grab a sleeping bag a pillow and a friend
We're gonna do it, it's gonna be awesome
With good times a friendship can blossom

[Verse 2: Froggy Fresh]
We just stood there staring at him, He was long gone
In the blink of an eye everything had gone wrong
Todd was a good friend, I was feeling sad
Then Chris said "guys we did something real bad"
No way dude that was your fault bro
"He was standing right behind me how was i supposed to know"
How were you supposed to know you were swinging around a sword
Inside this tiny little tent oh my god, good lord
"Well now what do we do? Now what do WE do!?
We don't do nothing bro this is on you
I Sure as heck didn't kill him, and neither did mike
Your the one that went took Todd and ended his life
"Yeah well it was your sword" So what if it was mine
That doesn't really matter, your the one who did the crime
You did it all alone, didn't no one else
You can go and take your crazy brain
And deal with this yourself

[Chorus: Froggy Fresh]
I said tonight we gonna be sleeping in the tent
So grab a sleeping bag a pillow and a friend
We're gonna do it, it's gonna be awesome
With good times a friendship can blossom
I said tonight we gonna be sleeping in the tent
So grab a sleeping bag a pillow and a friend
We're gonna do it, it's gonna be awesome
With good times a friendship can blossom

[Verse 3: Froggy Fresh]
Chris left the tent said he'd be right back
So Me and Mike sat down and we shared a few snacks
Crazy Chris man that kid is so deragned
Y'all when he came back he was carrying a chainsaw
I said whats that for, he said "To chop"
I said to chop what, he said "To chop Todd
My god  Chris, You can't be serious
Mike, Hello? Are you hearing this?
Then Chris told us both to get out of the tent
He started hanging plastic up so in the house we went
Me and Mike heard the chainsaw roar all night
Thinking to myself yo is this real life
We woke up the next morning, and Chris was on the news
The cops caught him after an hour pursuit
They cuffed him in the street around 11 o'clock
Carrying a chainsaw and a bag full of Todd

[Chorus: Froggy Fresh]
I said tonight we gonna be sleeping in the tent
So grab a sleeping bag a pillow and a friend
We're gonna do it, it's gonna be awesome
With good times a friendship can blossom
I said tonight we gonna be sleeping in the tent
So grab a sleeping bag a pillow and a friend
We're gonna do it, it's gonna be awesome
With good times a friendship can blossom
