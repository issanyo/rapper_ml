[Verse 1]
Friday the 13th, walking out of school
Me and Mike is trying to come up with something to do
We can go TP, we can watch movies
We can turn the bad channel on and see boobies
Mike, we do the same thing every week
By 9:15 I'm so bored I fall asleep
We ain't playing Halo, we ain't playing Joust
We pay a visit to the Vorhees' house
That last name got Mike's heart racing
Said "Wait a minute, that's the house of Jason
Oh no, no I ain't doing that
Are you going crazy? You must be going mad
You know what's gonna happen if we step into that house
Two of us go in and none of us come out"
But I convinced him, it wasn't very hard
He said that he'd go if I gave him my Charizard

Some people say that the whole thing's true
Other people say if you believe it, you're a fool
And Friday's the best day of the week
But not when it's Friday the 13th
Some people say that the whole thing's true
Other people say if you believe it, you're a fool
And Friday's the best day of the week
But not when it's Friday the 13th

[Verse 2]
I grabbed some garlic, I grabbed a cross
A jug of holy water, and a tube of lip gloss
Mike said "Dude, why are you bringing all this crap
Jason's not a vampire, put that stuff back
Hold up, let me see that lip gloss first
Mmm what is that? Is that berry burst?
This tastes good, you think that I can keep it?"
I says "Long as I can use it when I need it"
I grabbed my hat, my backpack, and my sword
Mike grabbed his house keys, we headed out the door
Mike said "Buddy, let's try to make this fast
Follow me, I know exactly where his house is at"
Mike stopped and he pointed at the crib
And said "That's the house where Jason Vorhees lives"
I crept up real quiet like a mouse
Then bam, Jason came busting out the house

[Verse 3]
We were running, we were running for our lives
We were more than just scared, we were freaking terrified
I was beatonized, bout to die from exhaustion
I looked back, Jason wasn't there, we must've lost him
We were getting tired so we stopped at a pavilion
I looked up and saw a skeleton hanging from the ceiling
I said "Mike what kind of place is this?
He's gon' kill us out here and there won't even be a witness"
Suddenly, Jason came stumbling up the trail
But he was looking rough, he was moving like a snail
He dropped to his knees and fell over face first
Hockey mask in the dirt, yo it look liked it hurt
Mike said "Dude, did Jason die bro?"
I replied "Mike, how should I know?"
Mike said "Ain't nobody gonna believe this"
I said "They gon' believe it when they see the freaking pics"
