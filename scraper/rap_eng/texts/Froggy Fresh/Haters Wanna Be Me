[Intro]
Hey everybody it's Krispy Kreme
And I'm back on another track
This one's for the club

[Verse 1]
I've been shot about 500 times
And I've done about 1 million crimes
I killed a great white shark
I knocked out his teeth, and I ripped out his heart
Talk crap and I'll give you a scar
Talk crap I'll throw eggs at your car
I'll cut holes in your tires
I'll put poop on your porch and I'll light it on fire

[Hook]
Yeah, said everybody wants to be me
The only problem is they can't even see me
Ball so hard record labels wanna sign me
Life is a race and everybody's behind me

[Verse 2]
Everybody gets scared when I front flip
If you come around here then you're done with
Have you ever been to the county fair?
I rode the Fireball and I wasn't even scared
I got swallowed by an anaconda snake
Then I told him, "You just made a big mistake."
Cause all I had to do was go like this
And just like that, I killed him with my fist

[Hook]
Yeah, said everybody wants to be me
The only problem is they can't even see me
Ball so hard record labels wanna sign me
Life is a race and everybody's behind me

[Bridge]
And everybody's behind me
And everybody's behind me
Life is a race and everybody's behind me
(Ahh!) Alright, let's go

[Outro]
Everybody on the left put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreme!"
And everybody on the right put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreme!"
And everybody in the back put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreme!"
And everybody up front put your hands up, and let me hear you yell "Krispy, Kreeeeeeme!"
Yeah! Krispy Kreme!
Yeah, that's for all the haters, and that's for all my fans
West side!
We out, peace!
