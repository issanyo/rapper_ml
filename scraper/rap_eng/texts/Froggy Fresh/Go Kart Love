[Verse 1]
Me and Mike was hangin' at the arcade
Stackin' tickets all day cause you know we're gettin' paid
I asked Mike what game he wanted to play
When I saw them pretty eyes lookin' over my way
I had prizes on the ground
Tokens in my hand
And a couple fat stacks of tickets hangin' out my pants
She could tell, she knew I was ballin'
So many numbers but I knew who I was callin'
I walked over and said you want some tickets girl
You wanna come chill at the crib, you wanna kick it girl
You wanna hold my hand, Let me be your man
You wanna wake up next to me in a foreign land
Let me know girl what you wanna do
Let me know girl I want the same thing as you
Look out there, yeah that go kart is mine
Won't you come jump in and I'll take you for a ride

[Chorus]
I said pretty lady please
Take a ride in my go kart
If I let you get inside
Would you let me in your heart?
I said pretty lady please
Take a ride in my go kart
If I let you get inside
Would you let me in your heart?

[Verse 2]
I told Mike we'd be right back, grabbed her by the hand
Then we climbed into my go kart it cost like a hundred grand
I hit the gas hard, then we peeled out of the parking lot
I couldn't believe it, yo this girl was freaking smoking hot
Then she asked if we could go stop by her house
I knew what this was about, homegirl wanted to make out
So I told her sure and then she asked me for some gum
So I popped open the glove box, had my stash of bubble yum
We pulled up at her house, she had me sit down on the couch
Then she went to her room and told me she would be right out
A couple minutes later she was walking out the room
With her boyfriend, he screamed out "Who the heck are you!"
She told him " Babe don't worry see I just brought him home cause he had cash, a go kart, and a fancy phone."
Just to be polite I gave the guy ten bucks
Then she said "No sweetie, this here is a stick up."

[Chorus]
Pretty lady please
Take a ride in my go kart
If I let you get inside
Would you let me in your heart?
I said Pretty lady please
Take a ride in my go kart
If I let you get inside
Would you let me in your heart?

[Narrator]
"Oh Froggy Fresh what have you gotten yourself into this time?
Just when things were starting to look up It seems as though the attractive female has lead him into a trap
She didn't want him for his good looks, she was only intrested in his cold hard cash. Yikes!
Let's see what happens next."

[Verse 3]
I darted for the door screaming "Yo I'm poor!"
I knew that I was screwed for sure, I didn't have my sword
I was frontin', spent all my dough on that go kart
Should have known better, hot girls ain't got no heart
Her boyfriend grabed me right before I made It out
I started screaming for the neighbors but he punched me in the mouth
I said "Fool I ain't chump!" but I am a chump
We both knew I was a chump, thats why I was getting jumped
They jacked my for my shoes and my sharp tooth necklace
They locked me up overnight and didn't feed me breakfast
I was in a room with seven other dudes
They would make us fight eachother to see who would get the food
I lost everytime so I rarely got to eat
You could see the tiny bones and my skinny little feet
Then I starved to death then I came back as a ghost
Now I haunt their house and I cook the prisoners toast

[Chorus]
Pretty lady please
Take a ride in my go kart
If I let you get inside
Would you let me in your heart?
I said pretty lady please
Take a ride in my go kart
If I let you get inside
Would you let me in your heart?
