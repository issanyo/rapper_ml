[Intro]
Krispy Kreme, and Daniel Tosh
Diamond Style Productions
And this a song for the television

[Verse 1]
Chilling in the kitchen eating peanut butter jelly
When my homeboy Daniel Tosh call me on the cellie
He said "Hey Krispy, you're coming out to Cali
I got some cute girls and there's one named Sally"
I got up on the airplane and headed for the airport
I said: "Daniel Tosh, you know what I'm there for
I'm there for all the women and the fame"
And Daniel Tosh said: "I'm there for the same thing"

[Hook] (x2)
It's me and Daniel Tosh and we're chilling in LA
Doing pushups and getting girls all day
Yeah we're never ever going back home
Cause now we're best friends and we'll never be alone

[Bridge]
Break it down
Daniel Tosh break it down
And Krispy Kreme break it down
Yeah just break it down

[Verse 2]
Got up in the party, there were girls everywhere
They asked if they can kiss me, I said sure, I don't care
But then I looked over and my homie's all alone
I walked over to Daniel and said what's the matter bro?
He said damn Krispy, I'm just not very smooth
But maybe someday I could touch a girl's boobs
I said you and you come over here and hold his hand
Then Daniel Tosh said thanks Krispy, you're the man

[Hook]

[Outro]
Peace
