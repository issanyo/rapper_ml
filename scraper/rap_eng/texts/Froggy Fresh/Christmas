Krispy Kreme
And Money Maker Mike
A Christmas song

[Verse One]
First thing on my list go figure
Its a brand new John Cena action figure
Second thing on my list guess what
Its a a really cute girl with a really cute butt
Mike said Krispy Kreme hold up
Mom said your not allowed to touch a girls butt until your grown up
That's right I forgot about that rule
Not allowed to touch butts until you graduate from school
But that's all right cause third on my list
Is a brand new John Cena watch for my wrist
Now were moving on to item number four
Its a brand new John Cena poster for my door
Check check it out y'all item number five
Its a brand new John Cena car that I can drive
Well I can't really drive it cause its too small
But I could if I was maybe like this tall

[Hook]
Christmas Christmas come check out my wish list
Have I been a good boy that's none of your business
I just want some good toys can I get a witness
Got all of my homies yellin' Christmas Christmas
Christmas Christmas come check out my wish list
Have I been a good boy that's none of your business
I just want some good toys can I get a witness
Got all of my homies yellin' Christmas Christmas

[Verse Two]
Item number six on my list is on lock
Gotta get that super hot John Cena lunch box
So tough the thing is made of steel
No more using brown paper bags for my meal
Item number seven is like a bite of heaven
I could probly' eat like ten or eleven
Check up in my stocking and guess what I found me
A brand new box of Betty Crocker fudge brownies
Item number eight player don't hate
Its probably the best toy in the whole state
A item so hot it could make the snow melt
Its a brand new John Cena wrestling belt
Now I gotta think about what I want from grandma
How about a brand new pair of John Cena pajamas
And one more thing I want even though I already have
It is the best cd of all time Illmatic
