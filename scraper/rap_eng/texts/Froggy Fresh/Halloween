[Intro]
Krispy Kreme
And Money maker Mike, of course

[Hook]
Ghosts, goblins and monsters galore
I dont even wanna trick or treat no more
Some of the scariest things I've ever seen
You know what I mean, it's Halloween
Ghosts, goblins and monsters galore
I dont even wanna trick or treat no more
Some of the scariest things I've ever seen
You know what I mean, it's Halloween

[Verse 1]
It was October 31st
Me and Mike have walked 10 miles and we were dying of thirst
Then all of a sudden we remembered about the curse
It was the curse of the Birmingham hearse
On this very night, 20 years ago
A big black hearse went spinning off the road
For no good reason it blew all 4 tires
And guess who was inside it..Mike Myers
We heard stories but we knew they werent true
Bout the boys who went missing, they only found his shoes
Scary, but it never happened to us
We werent afraid, we were way too tough
But then we heard a noise and then a creepy voice
Was it a monster? Was it James and his boys?
Then Mike Myers came busting out the bush
We got up on the bike, I screamed push Mike, push

[Hook]
Ghosts, goblins and monsters galore
I dont even wanna trick or treat no more
Some of the scariest things I've ever seen
You know what I mean, it's Halloween
Ghosts, goblins and monsters galore
I dont even wanna trick or treat no more
Some of the scariest things I've ever seen
You know what I mean, it's Halloween

[Verse 2]
Mike pedaled fast but it wasnt fast enough
Mike Myers never runs be he catches up
He knocked us down and we both went flying
The candy sprayed everywhere and Mike started crying
Forget the candy Mike, go and grab your stinking bike
Plus we got a bunch of candy I dont even really like
Mike he's got a stinkin' like, we're about to lose our lives
Pedal Mike, Pedal Mike, with all your might
We pedaled and pedaled, it felt like forever
He said it'd never happen, well..never say never
I took a look behind me, I didn't see a thing
But then my shoe lace got got caught up in the chain
The bike swerved, the bike crashed
And then we both got covered in trash
And right before our heads are bout to get hacked off
Mike Myers takes his mask off

[Hook]
Ghosts, goblins and monsters galore
I dont even wanna trick or treat no more
Some of the scariest things I've ever seen
You know what I mean, it's Halloween
Ghosts, goblins and monsters galore
I dont even wanna trick or treat no more
Some of the scariest things I've ever seen
You know what I mean, it's Halloween
