All I could do was wonder
Wonder if I was ever gonna see Mike again
Wonder why bad things always happen to good people
And I wondered why I didn't keep my promise to Mike
Cuz I told Mike that I was always gonna be there for 'em
And when Mike needed me most, I abandoned him
I shoulda been on that bus with Mike and I knew it
But there was nothin' I could do about it now

I'm sittin' here with this shirt in my hand
A feeling I can't stand, I'm 'bout to lose my best man
Me and Mike, been partners since the start
And now a bully's about to tear us apart
And these thoughts keep runnin' through my head
Is Mike alive? Is Mike dead?
Is Mike gone? Did Mike go to heaven?
I'm nervous, I head up to the Seven-Eleven
I'm restless, I'm out of control
Don't understand how one man could take another man's soul
Is it my fault? Should I blame myself?
Did I get Mike killed tryin' to save myself?
I stare into space
I'm losin' my mind, I'm losin' the race
I'm fallin' behind, I'm blind , It's like I can't see
Who's gonna watch my back when there's only just me?

Please Mike, don't go
Why is it that the good die young and the bad die old?
God, please help Mike
Don't let him die tonight cause it just ain't right

Please Mike, don't go
Why is it that the good die young and the bad die old?
God, please help Mike
Don't let him die tonight cause it just ain't right

I peek into his room and see the nurse come over
Then I recognize her face, I feel like I know her
I've seen her somewhere, My mind starts racin'
I can't figure it out and I'm losing my patience
Then bam! It hits me like a bomb
The nurse, It's her, That's James' mom
Before I can even blink, She covers up his mouth
And covers up his nose, Now Mike is passin' out
And I bust into the room, And push her out of the way
I'm at a loss for words, I don't know what to say
I shake Mike, I'm screamin' his name
Wake up! Wake up, Mike! I'm goin' insane!
Then his eyes open up, And he jumps out of bed
I scream, "Thank you god!" Cause Mike's not dead
We bolt for the door and head out into the night
We haven't won the war yet but we won the fight

Please Mike, don't go
Why is it that the good die young and the bad die old?
God, please help Mike
Don't let him die tonight cause it just ain't right

Please Mike, don't go
Why is it that the good die young and the bad die old?
God, please help Mike
Don't let him die tonight cause it just ain't right
