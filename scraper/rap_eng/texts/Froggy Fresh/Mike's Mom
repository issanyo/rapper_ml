[Verse 1]
Mike picked up the phone
Just like every other night Mike had to go home
But this time something felt strange
I can see it in his eyes, I can feel Mike's pain
He leaned over with his hands on his head
He screamed real loud til his face turned red
He took a deep breath, he paused and said
'My mom, she's dead.'
A robber thought nobody was home
But Mike's mom was there alone
The robber fired six shots from his gun
And she didn't have time to call 911
An eyewitness was there on the scene
And you're not gonna believe who she's seen
Mike nearly passed out when she gave the man's name
It was him, it was James!

[Hook]
I can see it in his face, I can see it in his eyes
Mike be strong, Mike don't cry
Mike hold on, Mike don't do it
Mike was gonna kill him, and everybody knew it

I can hear it in his voice, I can hear it in his cries
Mike don't go, Mike you're gonna die
Mike just stop, please, Mike, please
But he wasn't gonna stop 'til he made James bleed

[Verse 2]
He grabbed his gun and headed for the bus-stop
Then he waited out in the front of the gas-stop
And he got right up on the bus
He was a good guy, but he sure was nuts
I gave Mike my last farewell
Where he was headed he would not tell
I asked God to protect him
And if he died I asked heaven to accept him
Then Mike crawled out into the night
I told myself 'I hope I'm not right.'
But I don't think he'll come back
Unless It's in a casket wearing all black
I felt helpless, there's nothing I can do
And I ain't ever walked a mile in his shoes
But I knew that this was bad news
I was about to lose the most important member of my crew

[Hook]
I can see it in his face, I can see it in his eyes
Mike be strong, Mike don't cry
Mike hold on, Mike don't do it
Mike was gonna kill him, and everybody knew it

I can hear it in his voice, I can hear it in his cries
Mike don't go, Mike you're gonna die
Mike just stop, please, Mike, please
But he wasn't gonna stop 'til he made James bleed

[Bridge]
I heard about how it all went down
In the middle of the woods with nobody around
Mike and James with their finger on the trigger
Violence will only make your problem even bigger
James fired three shots into the night
Before Mike even had James in his sight
That's how it all went down
Violence is only gonna put you to the ground

[Hook]
I can see it in his face, I can see it in his eyes
Mike be strong, Mike don't cry
Mike hold on, Mike don't do it
Mike was gonna kill him, and everybody knew it

I can hear it in his voice, I can hear it in his cries
Mike don't go, Mike you're gonna die
Mike just stop, please, Mike, please
But he wasn't gonna stop 'til he made James bleed
