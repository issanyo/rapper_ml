[Verse 1]
Come on we gotta do something
And I know that nothing is free
But it seems like we never win nothing
And I just need something for me
To get me back on my feet
To pick me up when I'm weak
This is the only thing I ever dream about every night when I'm going to sleep
I just need something to know
When I look back and I'm old
When I look up on that shelf and then I see that trophy all shiny and gold
Something to comfort my soul
Guys I can't do this alone
Look guys, we're almost all grown up and now we're about to move up out of our homes
This is our last summer
This is our last supper
This is our last hurrah
Then life is gonna get a lot dang tougher
We're gonna look back and say these were the best days of our lives
We're gonna finish it proud, and we're gonna finish it right
Cause we're gonna be on our own
Ain't nobody gonna show us how
Cause we ain't gonna be kids next year
But we get to be kids right now
This is about more than that trophy
This is about being friends
And although this is a new beginning
Well this is also the end

[Hook]
And it feels just like a dream
I'm about to part ways with my team
But I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
No I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Until that trophy's in my hands
And it feels just like a dream
I'm about to part ways with my team
But I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
No I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Until that trophy's in my hands

[Verse 2]
Eight seconds left on the clock
Then gator passed me the rock
Man I just couldn't believe it
This was gone be my last shot
Childhood passing me by
The I thought about coolest guys
Then I thought about Halloween
Then about when his mom died
Then I broke into the lane
And then I stopped on a dime
Big Blue fell back as I squared up
Memories flashed through my mind
When I helped Mike get off Fun Trip
When I fought James with my sword
And then as I looked back at those good times I don't even care if I score
Then I leapt up off the ground
Everyone standing around
Everyone filled with emotion
But nobody's making a sound
Then I let go of the ball
Oh, Giant Jimmy's so tall
Jimmy jumped up for the block
But he didn't touch it at all
I was completely distracted
I thought we probably had lost
Suddenly, I heard the net snap
And then the buzzer went off
I don't really know how we did it, but I know that we did
Next year we was gonna be grown-ups, but right now we're just kids

[Hook]
And it feels just like a dream
I'm about to part ways with my team
But I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
No I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Until that trophy's in my hands
And it feels just like a dream
I'm about to part ways with my team
But I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
No I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Until that trophy's in my hands
And it feels just like a dream
I'm about to part ways with my team
But I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
No I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Until that trophy's in my hands
And it feels just like a dream
I'm about to part ways with my team
But I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
No I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Until that trophy's in my hands
