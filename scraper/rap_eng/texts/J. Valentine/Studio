Verse 1:
He was like
6'5
Big lips and brown eyes
His mind remind me of  the sunrise
It got brighter by the minute
I'm too caught up to be committed
Now I'm feelin different
‘cause I just wanna race to you
With skates on
Got me praying you could stay long
I remember when you first hit my peripheral
Should’ve known it would hit me, yo
‘cause I was like
Oh my
Wide eyed and memorized
And I don't ever really get like that
Tried to hold it
Tried to reel that back
But the feelings too
Strong for me to kill em
Imma need some space from you
Gotta go and make some art for you
Aww shit, you an artist too?
Man. it's funny what the heart'll do

Chorus:
I just wanna know
Do you think of me when you're in the studio?
Do you think of me when...
I just wanna know
Do you think of me when you're in the studio?
When you're in the studio? yea


Verse 2:
‘cause when I'm in this booth
All I see is you
I'm in my thoughts
All I think is you
Wondering if we speak the same language
Wondering if you vibrate on my wavelength
But we need to stick to being focused
Love is the realest hocus pocus
I ain't got the time
You ain't got the time, no
Later we'll see where we go



Chorus:
I just wanna know
Do you think of me when you're in the studio?
Do you think of me when...
I just wanna know
Do you think of me when you're in the studio?
When you're in the studio? yea

Bridge:
Do you think of me while making art?
Have I carved my name deep on your heart, boy?
Do you think of me when...
When it's late night and you're up grinding?
When you're in the studio?
