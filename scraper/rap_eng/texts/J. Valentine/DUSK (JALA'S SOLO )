Sometimes as I observe the sunset finishing up, I wonder about the stars in the night sky. Are they my ancestors smiling down at me? Are they simply balls of gas as generally described? Am I another star here on Earth? It's currently dusk and I hear people laughing across the grass. I see smiling and friendship. I see warm-hearted relationships. I see first-time hesitant kisses. I see people picking up others to go out and have a great time. Where am I ? Am I really envisioning all of this? I feel the environment shifting . The sky is extremely dark. I'm getting chilly but my soul is warm. I love this moment . What is love? Who do you love? Why do you love? Is love abstract? Is love measurable? What's that in the distance? I think I see waterfalls.
