Hook: I'm cruising and im in love with my life
Got the drop top with the windows down in my ride
Bops playin on my radio all night
Got Jala next to me she lookin fine 
Summer moonlight and air is feelin right
The scene is so divine
Like Kendrick said we gonna be alright
Welcome to the wonders of my life


Barz Verse : strawberry lemonade I'm gettin paid yeah my life is great I am loving this time 
Got the warm weather got the wind blowin and I really know that everything is in line
Keepin all the good friends , cuttin off the toxic , ain't no need for toxic go and pick up the signs
Life is just a memory , many memories come and go like a snap or a vine
Memories fade ima bring it right back 
Ima have a good time ,this money ima stack 
Keep pockets on swole, keep pockets on fat 
All on my girls body you would think im a tat 
Yeah summer 18
Ima go and live my dream 
While steady gettin green
, gonna do big things
, if ya know what ima mean
, gettin heavy on the scene
And im only 19
Been grindin for a minute and im
Just starting 
Rap and sing 
Ima stay climbin ima keep Shining
I'm self-made this life if sweet ..
Strawberry lemonade x2

Jala verse : me and my baby that will never change
He my loverboy I'm his pretty thang
Half the timeline shook , didn't know I sang
He got me on the hook , strawberry lemonade
He gonna wife me up cuz why waste the time
I know what I want and he know hes mine
Virgo , Capricorn yeah that is our signs
Not worried bout what we hear through the grapevine


Hook: I'm cruising and im in love with my life. Got the drop top with the windows down in my ride
Bops playin on my radio all night (all night , night , night ) got Jala next to me she lookin fine
Summer moonlight and air is feelin right
The scene is so divine
Like Kendrick said we gonna be alright
Welcome to the wonders of my life
