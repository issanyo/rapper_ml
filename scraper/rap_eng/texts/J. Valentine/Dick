[Intro]
In their time of need and loneliness
A one thing di woman dem waan
(Weh dem waan?), Di girls dem need
(Weh dem need?), Di girls dem waan
(Weh dem waan?), Di girls dem need
A friend
Dem need a buddy...
In their time of need and loneliness
(Weh dem waan), Di girls dem need
(Weh dem need), Di girls dem waan
(Weh dem waan), so mi introduce myself!

[Verse 1: (J)]
My name is Dick, I got a girl who has a cat
Always playin' on her lap
Sometime she purr when I'm petting her
My god, she love when I play with her fur
But my girl, she had a friend name Lynette
Love me from the first day we met
She tek a set, now I regret
Cause I never enjoy playin' with her pet
Something was wrong, she ran out of elastic band
So I didn't stay too long
She didn't have a clue but what to do
They don't have what it takes to tek weh your boo

[Chorus: (J)]
They don't know Dick like you know Dick
Dick is your dearest friend
They don't hug him, when he's in bed
Kiss him and play with his head
They don't know Dick like you know Dick
Dick is your dearest friend
They don't hug him, when he's in bed
Kiss him and play with his head

[Verse 2: (Beenie Man)]
My name is John, di girls dem buddy
Wuk nuff woman
I give di wickedest slam
A.K.A. magic wand, ding dong
Mi love by every woman (true!)
Hairy like a chimp, I am a pimp
Girl waan blow big like di good air blimp
True mi nuh whimp, and she a nymph
Mi affi stand up and work til' mi tired and limp
Me and a gyal a 'par, inna mi car
She waan war, waan eat mi nuts from out of di jar
Mi tell her stay far, from mi cigar
She a push mi and a push, til' mi just spit pon har

[Chorus: (Beenie Man)]
They don't know John like you know John
Original badman
Girl you know him from him a little youth
Now him big, a wear Ruff Rider suit
They don't know John like you know John
Original badman
Girl you know him from him a little youth
Now him big, a wear Ruff Rider suit

[Verse 3: (Beenie Man)]
Well!
Mr. John and Mr. Dick, di girls love dem
That's why dem cyan sleep a night, woman a bug dem
Woman a pull, woman a jerk, woman a tug dem
All when him tired and limp and him a shrug dem
Sometime him haffi turn dem up like him a mug dem
Double up him fist and run in and slug dem
But him nuh mean nuh harm, 'cause when him done him hug dem
Females always have a problem
