Chours

God its Thursday night
Speeding down the nile
Hanging out my ride
I could die tonight
We might go to hell
We might go to jail
Mama pay my bail
I know money is tight
Pool it all for  pills
Spend it on cheap thrills
I can't pay my bills
But i’m getting high
Every Thursday night
Every Thursday night
Every Thursday night
Every Thursday night


Vrs 1

Conscious rap
Needs a conscious voice
And a conscious trap
I was lacking that
But a massive attach
Of Reality
In actuality
A lack of glucose cause a pause
For those who hurt
Who sweep the dirt
We leave behind
The monster moved from up under the bed
To the comfort of mind
Undoubtedly tani the voice of my head just doubled me
Made the realization drastically
Apologies to every woman if I ever shift color in order to devour thee

Hanging out my ride
I could die tonight
We might go to hell
We might go to jail
Mama pay my bail
I know money is tight
Pool it all for  pills
Spend it on cheap thrills
I can't pay my bills
But i’m getting high
Every Thursday night
Every Thursday night
Every Thursday night
Every Thursday night

Vr 2

I been faded since like 2
While lies black truth
Liven like  the devil dose
God i am  in my element
Found the heavenly on earth
Baby whats your freedom worth
Freedom has a heavy fee
All the best is never free
I don’t want a 9 to 5
Siting fuck, i rather fly
249 until i die
I watch you clip all my wings
You still want me pursue my dreams


Vrs 3

I organise in order to purify
I seal the process of universal water
When it blows
With the rhythmic tone of equality
My own power double
Am a activation portal come settle

Maman is instrumental to the instrumental
I’m a instrument to keep my city mental
Not a mentor, just “Meant to”!
To who am meant to
Women or men to
Maman will come through
Women or men to
I rap 2 I’ma smoking 4 and am repin’ 9
With big shows i’ma smash doors
Am one of a kind
A gemini with a third eye open
I try to end “Apartheid Mind”! comping

You can’t cut of my wings
Made my angle wanna come sing
Takes an angle come convince
Get my city outta that sink!
Sink in oceans or turn that tide
Dirty vision need that Tide
Mashi, Raged Ya Sakes Sai!
(Mashi, Raged Ya Sakes Sai!)
