[Hook x2]
Kill your idols, sawed-off rifles
Have niggas bleedin' like a menstrual cycle
Claimin' that title; nigga, what title?
Chopper make 'em dance like a ballet recital

[Verse 1]
Played up with motherfuckin' low cash
Tryin' to get rich with my broke ass
Nigga need bread, I'm lookin' for some more cash
Sick of blowin' back, yo, and now I wanna blow gas
Forty on deck, and nigga I'm gon' blast
Money ain't power, catch up yo' ho ass
Run up on the dope man, with a black mask
You know what it is, nigga, take me to your stash
Now I'm dippin', outta that exit
Whip that dope, make sure I stretch it
Gotta figure free, goddamn good investment
Now I'm known as that little nigga with a nest egg
Fuck that, nigga, blow a hundred on a necklace
Mossberg pump 'case shit get hectic
Badass bitch laid up at the Westin
Feed me grits, cigarillos full of Welch's
Nigga, I'm a badman, badman
Twenty-five thousand dollars cash, man
Have them killers jumpin' out yo trash can
With them red dots on yo Ray-Bans
And I beat a bitch pussy like a caveman
Whip that Benz like a slave master
You can try to run from me but my chopper faster
'Bout to lay the competition out in front of the pastor, nigga

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Kill your idol, even if he me
Mossberg blow takin' off a nigga knee
In the middle of the war zone, that's where I be
Hand on my strap cause a nigga got beef
And that bitch suck dick like she ain't got teeth
Eliminatin' all competition with the heat
Illuminati illuminatin' and niggas can't see
Lame ol' flake is something I can't be
Leave it as an idol, something I can't see
Role model for your kids, my nigga, that ain't me
Better go to church, my nigga, I don't preach
I can only reach the one that I see

[Refrain]
Rollin' up blunts with they mouth full of fronts
Ride shotgun with the front seat slumped
I still black cause he just got jumped
Lookin' for them bitch niggas with the Mossberg pump

[Hook x4]

[Refrain x2]
