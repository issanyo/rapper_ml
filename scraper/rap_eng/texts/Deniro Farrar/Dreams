Lately I've been praying for a blessing
Money problems got a nigga stressing
Paranoid so I'm riding with a weapon
Trying to overcome it everybody wanna test me
Told Mama I ain't going back to County
Gotta keep them fuck niggas from around me
Meditating everyday got me grinding
Made it out the hood everybody look astounded
My teacher said I'd be dead or imprisoned
Can't nobody stop me my nigga I'm on a mission
Working overtime bitch you know I'm committed
Looking back on life it was hard but I did it
Working at the mall selling shoes for commission
Now we are at the mall, whole Hood getting tinies
I always gave back I never been stingy
You ain't take care of your people now they heart full of Envy

Started at the bottom with a dollar and a dream
Waking up for school in the Trap with the fiends
I was selling dope at the age of fifteen
Just to have some extra money but it wasn't what it seemed

Lost a lot of niggas they was hating on the team
Niggas dead and gone know exactly what I mean
We was trying to ball like Jordan and Kareem
On that Wu-Tang shit we was all about the cream
Just some niggas with a dream ( just some niggas with a dream x3)

How the fuck you real when you testified
Judge talking time you was terrified
Can't look me in my eyes coz you petrified
Pull up in the hood now they mesmerised
Nigga saying that they real but they telling lies
Swear to god my Revolution will be televised
I can't work no nine-to-five I'm My Own Boss
Ain't no frontin' me I'll take my own loss
Hit a nigga with the work and he run off
When you doing something good niggas gon talk
Screaming free my brother tune and he gon walk
Left the hood niggas saying that Im goin' soft
They opinion never mattered I just let them talk
When you doing good niggas wanna knock you off
Park that S550 on the sidewalk
Distribute the work grab the cake and then I drive off

They runnin' up boy you know a nigga trigger happy
Paranoid schizophrenic get it from my daddy
I don't trust shit but these slugs and this ratchet
Imma tell you this, the money ain't gon make you happy
Cause i started at the bottom with a dollar and a dream
Waking up for school in the Trap with the fiends
I was selling dope at the age 15 just to have some extra money but it Wasn't what it seemed
Just a nigga with a dream x3
