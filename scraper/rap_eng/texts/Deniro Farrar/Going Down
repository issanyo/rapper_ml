[Hook: Deniro Farrar x2]
I'm always getting home when the sun up
I be at the spot where it's going down
From the East coast to California
I be with them niggas they say run your town

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Look who made it out the gutter still stacking and living
Niggas hungry so they looking for a lick with they biscuit
In the park with my sons feeding ducks and fishes
Stay down through my struggle cause I came on a mission
With a pad and a pen takin' notes while I listen
Politicin' bout some business cause I'm fresh out of prison
Niggas who can't mind they business wind up floating with fishes
Up in Vegas with my niggas playing poker with wifey
Top floor Trump tower give a fuck if you like it
Turning up on all my haters now I feel like mighty chee
Ego still intact baby please don't lie to me
And I don't wanna hear it you can say your apology
She poured a cup of tea and came and laid on the side of me
Soul levitated, felt things inside of me
Front row seat to the game inside of me
All of my niggas tribe ain't no lames on side of me

[Hook: Deniro Farrar x2]

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
Went from runnin' from the cops now I'm runnin' a business
Taking laps in my pool with some beautiful women
Placing bets on myself cause I know Imma win it
Hit the mall with my son just to fuck up some digits
No regard for the money cause I get it with interest
Never in the booty club trickin' bread on the pigeons
Got the feds on my trail and it's getting relentless
Watching everything I see I liberated my vision
Barely schools in my city nigga that's how we living
Up in Harlem with the nation kicking knowledge on Lenox
Teaching brothers how to love with no type of condition
Never trust the government or crooked ass politicians
Looking back on where I came from, mama I did it
Switching lanes me and Joe up in that S550
Politicin' with them niggas they say runnin' the city
My bank account looking so juicy now I'm feeling like Biggie
Cause I'm on
