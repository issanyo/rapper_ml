Finally made it out the gutter where they
Now everybody acting like they fuck with me

Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Plenty nights I went to sleep without nothing to eat
Guess that's why hood niggas love the beef
Love that body without loving me
Gave hugs to the ones without hugging me
All them nights I cried ain't get no sleep
Halloween in my hood ain't get no treat
On the first day of school ain't get no sneaks
It's no wonder why them other kids picked on me
Say a prayer for anyone who ever shit on me
I got love for my woman, she ain't quit on me
All that bullshit I did she could've been left me
Still running out of gas with my tank on E
With my babies in the car now I'm feeling ashamed
Putting five in the tank gotta scrape up some change
Dedicate this to my momma cause she gave me the game
She told me hold my head up and start embracing my change

[Hook: Deniro Farrar]
Finally made it out the gutter where they want me to be
Now everybody acting like they fuck with me
Had to work my ass off it wasn't luck for me
I ain't going no where I guess you stuck with me
Finally made it out the gutter where they want me to be
Now everybody wanna know what's up with me
Finally seeing things they ain't want me to see
I ain't going nowhere I guess you stuck with me

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
Having talks with our day about lust and women
Told me bro I ain't perfect bro I'm the one to admit it
Been my dog since them days I was getting suspended
Living on the boulevard now I'm out of them trenches
My desire still there now I'm dealing with enemies (police)
Safe to say they don't fuck with my kinfolk
But I ain't ashamed guess it's part of the game
Nigga can't enjoy the sun without dealing with rain
Tune hit me on the phone tryna hide his stress
Cause the judge gave him 20 and he doing the state
That's a hard pill to swallow I ain't know what to say
Told him keep ya' head up and try to walk by faith
Certain things you can't change it's controlled by fate
But Imma always have your back every step of the way
Living right, I ain't tryna throw my blessings away
Hit my niece, say a prayer cause I ain't stressing today

[Hook: Deniro Farrar]

Finally made it out the gutter where they
Now everybody acting like they fuck with me
