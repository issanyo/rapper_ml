[Intro]

[Chorus x2]
Come into my home
See into my sea
Breath into my breath
Third eye third
Come get a slice
Of elevation pie
Let it get you high
Energy never lie
[?]
Kiss me but never tell
They say love is blind
My heart is made of [?]

Why don't climb up on top of me
Universe watches me
Fuck until this morning
I like buns with no poppy seeds
She don't fuck with GMOs
And all she smoke is broccoli
And I been dealing in rapping
Rapping 'n dealing
Focused on me has
Manifested until my money stacked to the ceiling
I've been stacking and rapping
Rapping and stacking
But my karma way too deep for my actions
I swear I hate it
I don't fear death no more
Just reincarnation
Heart of a soldier
With the brain to teach a nation
I've been running out of patience
Lately I've been elevating
Working on the best version of me
That's what I told my old lady

[Chorus x2]
Come into my home
See into my sea
Breath into my breath
Third eye third
Come get a slice
Of elevation pie
Let it get you high
Energy never lie
[?]
Kiss me but never tell
They say love is blind
My heart is made of [?]

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
I don't fuck around with molly
But I might just hit your weed
I don't want them GMOs
That they selling in them stores
Used to eat 'em back then
But I don't like 'em no more
Searching for my sin
& meditating under trees
Reading books to my sons
[?]
Picnic with my lady
Lovebirds in the trees
[?]
I do shit you wouldn't believe
Looking at my babies
They're a reflection me
Looking at yourself
Nigga tell me what you see
I can stand here today
And say I'm happy being me
If I had to meet myself
I'd be one to meet

[Chorus x2]
Come into my home
See into my sea
Breath into my breath
Third eye third
Come get a slice
Of elevation pie
Let it get you high
Energy never lie
[?]
Kiss me but never tell
They say love is blind
My heart is made of [?]
