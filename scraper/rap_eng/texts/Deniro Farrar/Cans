[Intro: Deniro Farrar]
Yeah
Free tune
We that generation
Uh

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Product of the projects that's where I was raised
Victim of the system I was told that crime pays
F the honor roll I was trynna serve Js
Sick of watching mama struggle now it's time to get paid
My homie flipping packs he just trynna stay afloat
It's a cold world see somebody serve their mama dope
Dope game messed up and it's really cut [?]
My homie lost his life flexing junkies with their soap
In the game here first trynna stay from all the ropes
The judge give you thirty that's [?] with no rope
Tell me what I'm supposed to do, cause I'm hungry and I'm broke
Told mama not to cry cause we all gotta go
Only thing we got in common I'm just here to let you know
I ain't human I'm a prophet hitting dudes with my flow
Homie we that generation going crazy for the dough
Lil' homies stay in school, they already thinking slow
Drug game messed up it's too late to sell dope
Mess around and lose your life on these streets and coasts
And just cause you walk away don't make you coward or a joke
Just cause you walk away don't mean you coward or a joke
And I'm with that on my [?]
Yo, I'm just here to let you know
Yeah, Just cause you walk away don't mean you coward or a joke
Be my [?], you already know
You already know

[Outro: Deniro Farrar]
