[Hook]
So many days go by
Ain't enough minutes in an hour
Ain't enough bullets in my chopper
Smoked my last blunt of sour
And it's so many days go by
Ain't enough months in a year
Lost my nigga this year
So I thank God I'm here

[Verse: 1]
365 in a year, 60 minutes in an hour
36 oz.'s in a whole key so 28 grams in an hour
Chasing money and power, yeah, chasing money and power
Chain smoking my sour, serving bars of that powder
Then I take a whole key, rock it up to the shake, jack a nigga for the plate of that sour
Fuck nigga, you a coward, AK bullets going shower (bang bang!)
On any nigga block, bitch niggas get chopped if you pussy niggas kill one of ours
Lost my dog and it hurt me, I didn't get tell him "bye"
I ain't gotta tell y'all why homicide on my mind
Momma tell me "just pray, and everything going be fine"
Well momma, I ain't even got time
Too busy writing these rhymes, busting down pounds of this pine
So corrupted by crime

[Hook]

[Verse: 2]
I'm just watching my days go by, all my time just fly
Momma stressed out cause the bills still coming and she lost here job, oh my
What the fuck we going do? Yeah, what the fuck we going do?
I was only 16, had hoops dreams said, "fuck that" and I dropped out of school
Got my pack and I loaded my tool, selling dope what I do
I ain't telling y'all that's cool, I ain't telling y'all that's cool
Cause if I knew what I knew right now back then would've stayed my ass in school
Momma need help paying rent, and my lil' bro need new shoes
And my ex-girl cut me loose, yeah, my ex-girl cut me loose
Judge giving niggas like 25 years, that's a nigga lynching with no noose
I guess life's a catch 22, sell dope and you lose
Come walk a mile in my shoes, see all the bullshit I go through
