[Chorus]

Clocking in clocking out, another day another dollar
You can't even pump your gas, without some niggas trying to holla

I just want you to know I noticed (4x)

You go to school And go to work. Cash your check then go home single parent all alone. God damn girl you strong

I just want you to know I noticed (4x)

[Verse 1]

It's 5 in the morning, and you ain't had no sleep
Cause your youngest baby teething, just 1 of your lil 3

Your baby dad is a statistic, another dead beat
Shit my daddy was the same, so my Moma raised me

But she still found a way, to overcome a break free
Working job after job, 1 or 2 or maybe 3

To put food on the table, making due with ends meet
So I know about that pain that you feeling, and it's deep

And he beat you like he's strong, but that really means he weak
Now your plotting for revenge, wanting to killem in his sleep

But shit we all humans, and ain't no body perfect
No I anit making excuse but that nigga just ain't worth it

This your last year of school, you're about to graduate
Lost some friends along the way, because their heart was full of hate

They mad cause you got that job, making more than what they make
Fuck them bitches, you don't need them any way

Family always wanting something, never call to tell you hey
Or to check up on your kids, or care to ask about your day

I just want you to know I notice...
You ain't alone, so anytime you want to talk don't hesitate just hit my phone

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

You threw on some yoga pants, that compliment your figure, just to run and grab some milk, you weren't worried about no nigga

But they always try and holler, but never step correct
Making comments bout your ass, showing blatin disrespect

But you always keep it real, and put them niggas back in check
They break their necks whenever they see ya, damn near causing wrecks

And that's when you're in you're scrubs, they ain't even seen you when you dressed
Got them kids wit no stretch marks, damn girl you blessed

Making moves on you own, you ain't worried you ain't stressed
Plus you never hit the club, cause you know it's full of mess

Trying to hold it in the road, and let GOD do the rest
Niggas throwing money at you, but you ain't even impressed

You clocking in clocking out, another day another dollar
You can't even pump your gas, without some niggas trying to holla

I just want you to know I noticed, you ain't alone
So any time you wanna talk don't hesitate just hit my phone

[Chorus]
