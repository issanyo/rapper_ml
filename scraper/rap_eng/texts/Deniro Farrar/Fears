[Intro]
Yo, KOBK the murder gang
Shit
Free Tune, That's my bro
Yo, I'm the fucking coldest

[Verse: 1]
In the hood trying to make it out
So what the fuck they mad about?
Rappers in my city don't want me to make a route
Jackers gon' jack so I'm prepared to take 'em out
Baby's on the way and I ain't got a dime
Just a choppa to my name and these books of rhymes
All alone in a room with this crooked mind
Watching rappers' videos knowing I can take their shine
Calm, tell me be patient, and take my time
I been struggling too long now I'm takin' mine
What good is being hot if nobody notice?
That in a room full of rappers I'm the fucking coldest

[Hook]
Only, tells me some things I don't wanna know
And I can't
Tells me some things I don't wanna know
(I'm the fucking coldest)
No I can't

[Verse: 2]
Mind over matter but the matter is
The fact that we live with no time to give
Our fam, we throwing money at our kids
They be starving for knowledge and I can see their ribs
No ambition for college, they sitting at the crib
Selling drugs, probably be the next getting killed
On the block, there's 30 more just like 'em
I don't bond til those crackers come a reindict 'em
Chain smoking blunts, now they searching for a title
That you earned in the hood cause you shot a rifle
Guns make niggas feel tall like the Eiffel
Til somebody shoot 'em down and their body stiffle
Fuck a magazine, you need to read a Bible
Wicked preacher steal money for his own survival
Or maybe I'm just taking notice
That in a room full of rappers I'm the fucking coldest

[Hook]
