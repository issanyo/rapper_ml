[Chorus] (x2)

Mafia business, niggas snitchin'
Then they gone murder ya'
Keep yo lil' money, If I don't know ya' then I ain't servin' ya
Fuckin' they bitches, now they claimin' that they gone murder us
Fuck with you hangin', what you claimin?
Nigga come swerve on ya'

[Verse 1]

Mafia business, if he snitchin', take out his whole team
Three million cash, had to weigh it up on the coke beam
Niggas be flippin', servin' chicken, trapped out some Popeyes
Walkin' up lettin' loose on you nigga ain't no drive-by
Glock-40 on me with extension, don't be approachin' me
Fucked his lil' bitty, now he claimin' he wanna murder me
Catch him in traffic, while he lackin', give him a 3rd-degree
Sniper with rifles, whip that pistol, I can do surgery
Ain't no new faces, I don't know ya' then I don't serve ya' nigga
Mafia shit, if he snitchin', you gettin' mudered nigga
Askin' me questions, you won't get nun', cause I ain't seen shit
Fuck who you know and where you from, nigga that don't mean shit

[Chorus] (x2)

Mafia business, niggas snitchin'
Then they gone murder ya'
Keep yo lil' money, If I don't know ya' then I ain't servin' ya
Fuckin' they bitches, now they claimin' that they gone murder us
Fuck with you hangin', what you claimin?
Nigga come swerve on ya'
