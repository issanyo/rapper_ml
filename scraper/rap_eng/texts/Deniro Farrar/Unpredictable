Auntie died, me and Corey got close
I can see it in his eyes that his heart growing colder
I still got my mama, so I don't know his pain
Death brought us back together, got me thinking what a shame
Got 2 sons months apart, we be dealing with the same
Fucking women a vice for me, I'm dealing with the pain
Lost my lady, too destructive, she don't look at me the same
I didn't want to let her go but hell I had to make a change
Rapping all I got besides the love for my sons
Tune turned himself in cause he was living on the run
Say he wanted for a murder, he was strapped with a gun
Judge did my brother dirty cause they ain't give him no bond
Hurt me to my heart, he ain't never heard my son
Talked to him on the phone but I can tell in his voice
He trying to stay strong, he ain't got no other choice
Told me "'Niro you gon' make it, just exercise your voice."
Me and Sosa falling out, I just want him to listen
I find myself getting distracted, not completing my mission
Rappers in my city thinking that we in competition
But I'm in my own lane, we just hustling different
Me and Duru still cool but we don't talk that much
Since we went our separate ways we barely keeping in touch
I can't tell you when it changed but it don't feel the same
But I swear it's all love bruh, keep doing your thing
Made a movie out in Kansas thanks to Rico James
JR I ain't forgot ya boy, keep doing your thing
Bossy riding til the end, G you family too
They got my back, I got they back
Cause that's what families do
I don't tell you all the time but bruh I love you the same
If you could do it all over you wouldn't do it the same
But we live and we learn, I can tell that ya changed
Family treat a nigga different now, they think that I'm famous
But attention is a drug that I'm struggling wit
I can't lie, deep down I love fucking these bitches
I ain't never treat 'em right, now I'm seeking forgiveness
Jasmine never lied to me, such a beautiful spirit
Never did it for the groupies, hoes, cars, or Bentleys
I ain't really into cars but want that S55
Shout out to my brothers Gio, Don Don, and Bentley
Rest in peace to Aunt Pam I know you right here with me
Everytime I call Wendel he was coming to get me
Never told me bullshit or raised his hand to hit me
All my exes still checking, always saying they miss me
But I'd rather be alone, solitude, no movies
But my mind my change, Gemini's so moody
My duality is real I feel like two different people
That's why I struggle with commitment
Cause one woman can't equal
Up to everything I need so I take them in sequels
