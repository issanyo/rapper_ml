[Hook]
Cause I've done been back and forth and forth and back
Up and down like all the time, I hope I make it with these rhymes
Cause I've done been up and down and down and up
Stressin' all the fuckin' time, I hope I make it with these rhymes

[Verse: 1]
Cause I've done been back and forth and forth and back
Smoking loud and selling crack
Stood out on the block with cops patrolling, still sold my pack
Running in and out, promised momma I ain't going back
When she heard them sirens, boy, she damn near had a heart attack
Young with no education, I can whip a quarter back
Jumping in and out the game, but I was never quarterback
Bought my first quarter pound, broke it down in quarter sacks
Rick Bard, rooster red, Rio, y'all remember that
Beefin' on the regular, shootouts on our schedule
Block hustlin' baited us, but never was I ready for
Cases that I caught, got me rappin' on the regular
Eliminatin' competition, crushin' all competitors
So let me do what I do, can't nobody fuck with me
Therefore I will not fuck with you, I promise to always tell the truth
Stood out on the block in blistering cold, hustlin' with my troops
Lookin' through my scope, when you're ready, aim that bitch and shoot

[Hook]

[Verse: 2]
Cause I've done been up and down and down and up
Stressin' all the fuckin' time
Still in the trap, there's junkies shootin' up like Columbine
Grew accustomed to the crime, before I ever went through customs
Police slammed my brother down, locked him up and handcuffed him
Fuck the law, I live above it, bitch I'm thuggin' and I love it
Back and forth, forth and back, arguments about my clubbin'
Momma stressin', baby stressin' worried 'bout me, cause they love me
Weighin' pounds and sellin' P's, my big brother was pushin' keys
Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without no presents under the fuckin' tree
Sat and the round table, breakin' bread with Tune and Steve
Back and forth and forth and back, chillin' with my cousin E
Smokin' loud and pumpin' weed, rap is all the fuck I need
Watchin' movies with my niece, dreamin' 'bout my own fam
Hopin' I get rich off sellin' P's and movin' white grams
Really that's all the fuck I know, .45 tucked in my coat
Before the day my momma go I hope a nigga fuckin' blows up

[Hook]
