[Intro]

[Verse 1: Deniro Ferrar]
I'm Starving
I Ain't talking about no artist
If a nigga balling in the club, Imma rob him
Body bag full of fuck nigga, go grab a coffin
California kush be the reason why I'm coughing
Get jacked for the excess floss
And hoes be in my view, so be cautious
Youny niggas, they ain't do no talking
Died in a jet, but I ain't Tom Coffin
Screaming "Fuck How You Feel"
Ain't no other nigga kick shit like this
Cuz them other niggas ain't got my skill
I'm too real to ever be fake
They too fake to ever be real
Took my time, perfected my craft
Now its time to see me some mills
Fuck nigga
Why the hell you hating on my generation
Squeezing guns with no hesitating
For any kind of altercation
Living life fast with no time for patience
Breaking down dope, cuz its reefer baby
