Yo, free Tune. That's my bro.

(2x)

Can't get sleep, (why?) newborn hungry (yup)
Woke up in the bed with a bitch who don't want me
Voices in my head keep telling me to pray
I ain't got shit to my name but this AK

[Verse 1]

And I'm just a fucking victim to them voices in my head
Been with her for so long yet she a stranger in my bed
She told me I ain't shit, she wish that I was dead
Sick of feeling hunger pains, smoking til my eyes red
Fuck eating a crumb, boy I want a slice of bread
Don't know how to be a father, and that feeling got me scared
I'm looking in the mirror, and don't know what I see
A reflection of my past and it's still haunting me
I wake up to hearing screams, hit the block and serve fiends
Gotta feed my fucking son, you know what the fuck I mean?
And I can't get sleep, he crying cause he hungry
Tried to do his mama right, that bitch didn't want me and I...

[Verse 2]

And the only thing I own is this mothafuckin choppa
Sick in the head, I think I need to see a doctor
She always going clubbing, she forcing me to watch him
I feed him then I change him then I set him in his rocker
I should've known better; shit, his mama was a bopper
But that ain't no excuse cause I'm still that baby's papa
Thinking bout them days crying on my mama lap
Asking bout my daddy, shit I wonder where he at?
She looked at me and said that he ain't never coming back
But what she really meant is he was somewhere smoking crack
So ever since that day I put my family on my back
Walking round with my choppa feeling like I'm in Iraq, and I...
