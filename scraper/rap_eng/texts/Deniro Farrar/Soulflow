Verse 1:
Vagabond yea I wander
On my own, I'm a loner
Call me hippie, call me stoner
Keep it rollin' like a boulder
I just been floatin' around
Feet never stuck to the ground
I never stay in one place
There's way too much money to make (yeah)
See I'm addicted to this lifestyle
I can chill later
I'mma live now
You know I'm always on the go
Living fast, burning slow
No rules, no control
Your shadow ain't blockin' the glow (Oh oh oh)

Hook:
Just let my soul flow free
My soul flow free
No chains on me
Just let me soul flow free
It's a natural thing
My soul flow free
(2x)

Verse 2 (Deniro Farrar):
Hard so be sure when you're living in doubt
On the wrong path tryna figure it out
I really don't know what these feelings about
Shit I guess a nigga tryna figure it out
But anyway, anyhow nigga I'ma go get it
Once I get the piece of the pie we can both split it
Bought a crib and I moved all my folk in it
Ain't happy but hell I guess they won't get it
Tired of being broke
Tired of being pitiful
Put my mind to it now I'm rich from the syllables
Livin out my dream and the whole world miserable
Pop a pill gon' roll up some dope with it
Still ain't free but hell you gotta cope with it
Life ain't free
Somebody gon' pay the price
Can't live it twice
My nigga you better live it right
