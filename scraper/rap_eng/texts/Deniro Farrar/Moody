Yeah we went to school together and we from the same hood
But things done changed, nah we ain't all good
Used to wish you happy birthday, now I wish the fuck I would
Things done changed now, we ain't all good
Yeah we went to school together and we from the same hood
But things done changed, nah we ain't all good
Used to wish you happy birthday, now I wish the fuck I would
Things done changed now, we ain't all good

[Verse 1]
I used to spend the night witcha
Steal bikes witcha
Scrappin' in the party any given night witcha
Play ball witcha, skip the hall witcha
Shy with them girls and I made the call witcha
Jordan's got released and I hit the mall witcha
Hell or high water I been through it all witcha
Took the charge for ya, thought you was my brother
Come to find out you just a bony motherfucker
Would took a bullet for ya, nigga cause I love ya
When ya mama died I was right there for ya
Slick and them robbed ya I was right there clutchin'
Seen them at the store, no talking I start bussin'
Things done changed, we don't speak no mo'
Heard you start talking down, fell in love with a hoe
Guess the power of the pussy made you do something strange
You were 'posed to keep it solid, that ain't part of the game
If you could do it all over would you do me the same?
Kept it solid with a nigga, he ain't do me the same
If you could do it all over would you do me the same?
I kept it solid with you nigga, you ain't do me the same

[Hook]
Yeah we went to school together and we from the same hood
But things done changed, nah we ain't all good
Used to wish you happy birthday, now I wish the fuck I would
Things done changed now, we ain't all good
Yeah we went to school together and we from the same hood
But things done changed, nah we ain't all good
Used to wish you happy birthday, now I wish the fuck I would
Things done changed now, we ain't all good

[Verse 2]
And I seen you in the club but we ain't even speak
With them niggas on light, knowing we got beef
Heard you moving on up, now you serving them chickens
Still on that sucker shit, got a weakness for women
But I'm done with the trap, got a baby and wife
Don't get it fucked up, still got my killer ways
Seen you riding through my hood serving other nigga Js
They starting to feel threatened cause you standing in the way
It's money on your head, you'll be dead in a day
To keep this shit a buck I still love you nigga
I don't even know why cause you don't love me nigga
Started thinking to myself why the fuck should I bother
But I don't wanna see your kids grow without their father
Tried to tell you something good but you took it as jokes
Found you dead in your car with a knife in your throat
Damn it's funny how a dollar made your life so short

[Hook]
Yeah we went to school together and we from the same hood
But things done changed, nah we ain't all good
Used to wish you happy birthday, now I wish the fuck I would
Things done changed now, we ain't all good
Yeah we went to school together and we from the same hood
But things done changed, nah we ain't all good
Used to wish you happy birthday, now I wish the fuck I would
Things done changed now, we ain't all good
