[Intro: Cam Johnson]
Everyday, huh, yeah, everyday
Huh, woah, everyday, huh, woah, everyday
Huh, woah, everyday, yeah, everyday
Huh, yeah, everyday, huh, yeah, everyday

[Chorus: Cam Johnson]
Everyday I'm Superman, I save the day, okay, uh huh
E-40, hustlin' in a major way, okay, uh huh
With my dogs and we all on that paper chase, okay, uh huh
Ain't no option, 'bout to get it several ways, okay, uh huh
Everyday I'm Superman, I save the day, okay, uh huh
E-40, hustlin' in a major way, okay, uh huh
With my dogs and we all on that paper chase, okay, uh huh
Ain't no option, 'bout to get it several ways, okay, uh huh

[Verse 1: Cam Johnson]
Got them laser fours on my feet, huh
'Bout to be in Fader Fort for my speech, huh
Slumped up off that purple, I ain't drankin' lean, nah
But i got a love affair with THC, yeah
And I'm drippin' like I slipped up in a stream, yeah
And the vision, get my face on every screen, yeah
Keep the cookies on me like I'm Aunt Petunia
Hot flows, gettin' them O's, Krispy Kreme, yeah
I keep on findin' different pockets like a winter coat
You mad 'cause this shit harder than the illest shit you wrote
Ayy, 'bout to get them glaciers on my fist, I'm sinkin' boats
And I'm a mothafuckin' starboy, see my twinkle, ho?
Ayy, all about my business, feelin' like I'm Warren Buffet
I'm startin' to put my private thoughts on wax now for the public
The people fuckin' with my sounds, this ain't up for discussion
Ayy I'm volcano on the beat and this my fourth eruption

[Chorus: Cam Johnson]
Everyday I'm Superman, I save the day, okay, uh huh
E-40, hustlin' in a major way, okay, uh huh
With my dogs and we all on that paper chase, okay, uh huh
Ain't no option, 'bout to get it several ways, okay, uh huh
Everyday I'm Superman, I save the day, okay, uh huh
E-40, hustlin' in a major way, okay, uh huh
With my dogs and we all on that paper chase, okay, uh huh
Ain't no option, 'bout to get it several ways, okay, uh huh

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
Hard niggas turn soft when that MAC around
Put a nigga in the post, then I back him down (Back him down)
Ain't no runnin' from that beam when they gun you down (Nah)
Squashin' beef or coppin' plea, how the fuck that sound?
I don't fuck with new niggas, stay the fuck from 'round
I'ma show you how we do it on my side of town
All this water on a nigga, I might fuckin' drown (Splash)
We don't do the breakdowns, only whole pounds (Whole thang)
Niggas say they gettin' money, they ain't got a damn thing
All we know is run it up, come and join the campaign
Hit a nigga's bitch and now he feels some type of way
Hustlin' like I'm E-40, shout out to The Bay (Yuh)

[Chorus: Cam Johnson]
Everyday I'm Superman, I save the day, okay, uh huh
E-40, hustlin' in a major way, okay, uh huh
With my dogs and we all on that paper chase, okay, uh huh
Ain't no option, 'bout to get it several ways, okay, uh huh
Everyday I'm Superman, I save the day, okay, uh huh
E-40, hustlin' in a major way, okay, uh huh
With my dogs and we all on that paper chase, okay, uh huh
Ain't no option, 'bout to get it several ways, okay, uh huh
