[Faded Intro: Deniro Farrar]
Gather round from the tallest to smallest
Murdered in the hood cause your mind stopped evolving

[Hook: Deniro Farrar x3]
Gather round from the tallest to smallest
Tell stories bout how mankind fallen
Murdered in the hood cause your mind stopped evolving
Searching for answers, we dying too often

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Nigga I was born alone Imma die alone
Riding in my uber strapped with these on
Finger on the trigger of the fucking chrome
Pussy nigga better leave me the fuck alone
I done made a lot of choices that was really bad
I done fucked up more money than ya ever had
Lost so many niggas thinking bout that make me sad
I never thought I'd live to see the day I'd be a dad
Hit the mall with my sons just to blow a bag
Swervin' in that 550 with the paper tags
It don't mean shit my nigga I don't ever brag
Half them hoes that they love I already had
He see my picture on her phone now her nigga mad
Come and try me bout a bitch I bet I beat ya ass
But I made my bed I gotta lay in it
God blessed me with this gift I can't play with it
All these crabs in the bucket wanna pull me down
Keep it real nigga that's why I don't come around
She ain't want me back then but she want me now
Cause she think I got them mills in my bank account
But I'm still on my grind baby I ain't rich
All you gold diggin' hoes out here ain't shit
NIggas didn't know me then say they know me now
To keep it real nigga that's why I don't come around

[Faded Outro: Deniro Farrar]
Murdered in the hood cause your mind stopped evolving
Gather round from the tallest to smallest
Murdered in the hood cause your mind stopped evolving
