[Intro]
Yo, Deniro Farrar
Peaceful music, nigga
Know that
Every morning I wake up
I look to the skies above and thank God for another day
Every night before I go to sleep
I look up to the stars and I pray
It don’t matter if you a scared nigga
A real nigga or the mother of a dead nigga
You still look to the sky when you pray
Know that

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Birds chirpin', druggers lurkin', tryin' to find they crack rock
I’m in the kitchen helping my little niece pack up her lunch box
Still do or die 'round these parts so my gun cocked
Never know who might approach while standin' at her bus stop
Kiss her on the forehead, tell her make her uncle proud
Right after I hurt a nigga I fire up my blunt of loud
Now it's time I hit the block, take my chances sellin' rock
I'm already fire hot, just had a run-in with the cops, yo
(They look at the sky)
Staring off into the sky, smoking kush until I'm high
Watching my life pass me by, I’m still tryna' figure why
My mama serving fast food, she work until her body tired
Do it all tomorrow, got too much pride to borrow
I’m selling drugs to my fam with no remorse or sorrow
Just tryin' to buy some time cause we ain't promised tomorrow
My cousin's car got repoed cause he ain’t pay his condo
I'm knee-deep in the dope game getting money in my cargoes

[Verse 2]
Reminiscent 'bout them days
Holding hands with my mama walking on that playground
Now I’m caught up in that drama
Just a statistic, upliftin' niggas spirits
I was born with the gift to paint these pictures with my lyrics
I've been diagnosed the sickest
With none of y'all permission
I used to get beat with switches
Now we beat niggas pretendin'
I'm gone off that gremlin and arms reaching my semi
Paranoid, schizophrenic
Pray to Lord ya'll forgive me

[Verse 3]
Shit, I’m just a lost bird flying on the wrong path
My nigga with them chickens make them jump back a whole half
Feedin' pigeons with my niece
I'm tryin' to help her with her math, birds of a feather flock together
I’m so fucking glad
I turned out the way I did, without the help of my dad
Now I’m all alone, blowing strong in my bachelor's pad
Penthouse on the top floor, I can’t see shit but these birds
They told me that I could fly, now my body on the curb
Word

[Outro x2]
Every night I hit my knees
I just pray that god turns me into a bird
I fly away (x2)

Know that
