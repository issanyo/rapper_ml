Chorus x 2
Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end
I'mma tell y'all like a nigga told me
If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g

[Verse 1]
Roll up blunts of that dro
Bullet proof under my clothes
Clutching my .45 close
Told mama that I love her, but we all gon' go
Walking with my head hung low
Wishing all my niggas wasn't dead no more
Reminiscing about days when we hustled for the dough
Drug money in my hands made my heart go cold
Always bending down, guess I ain't know
Never had shit, always wanted more
Nigga told me, can't take it when you go
Watch your enemies and you better keep them close
Going bout a hundred on a dead end road
'Til the pearly gates, seen God at the door
Fuckin' with the devil, I done sold my soul
Feeling bad cause I cheated on my girl wit' them hoes
Baby girl I love ya, don't want you to go
Doing what I can but a nigga still broke
Stay by my side, she ain't with me for the dough
Thinking about suicide with my brains on the floor
Never had a daddy, it was just big bro
If it's all over, I just want him to know
I ain't give up on rap, wouldn't stop 'til I blow
But the world about to end and it coming for my soul
And I don't wanna go

Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end
I'mma tell y'all like a nigga told me
If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g

[Verse 2]
Lord if you coming, give a nigga a sign
Lord, killer trying to ease my mind
Never went to church, occupied with crime
Stay down in the trap, busting down those dimes
Took my charge cause the pack was mine
Dropped in a cell, counting down the time
Dropped outta school, told mama all the time
I'mma go get saved but I'm always lying
Trying to live right in a world that's wrong
Just a nigga with a heart broke song
Can't get sleep, been up bout a week
Popped so many pills that my heart skipping beats
Waiting on the end, still selling my kit
Trying to stack money for a brand new benz
Looking for a lick cause a nigga need ends
Trying to find my dogs but they blowing in the wind
Caught up on the strip or they locked in the bid
So I'm praying, hoping that they get heard
Wishing they was free like some motherfucking birds
And I'm still in the hood where they killing over words
God looking down like "You niggas got nerve
Killing over money, hit the mall and splurge"
Worried bout the end, I can feel something
Seen them angels coming and the five all running

Chorus x 4
Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end
I'mma tell y'all like a nigga told me
If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g
