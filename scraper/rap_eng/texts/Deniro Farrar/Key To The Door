[Verse]
Don't work in the city, it's dry
Jackin' you niggas supply
Robbin' niggas on the low, sellin' that shit for the high
I'm frontin' whatever you buy
Just bring me my piece of the pie
You rappin', I'm trappin', no lie
You niggas ain't fuckin' with I
When I first met the bitch, she was shy
Now she be whippin' them pies
30 rounds in my full fire
You cross on the mic, you gon' die
My niggas be flippin' and weighin' the coke
Niggas be drainin' from sniffin' the coke
Got a bad habit (?) show
Step on the world like I'm killin' a roach
Learn how to whip you can never go broke
Straight off the boat and we get it in bulk
Pounds of the lot, and got bands in the (?)
Heard that you got it, we comin' to get it
Chasin' that money, you chasin' these bitches
(?), you cover all of my dishes
Pounds of the loat, and got bands in the (?)
We heard that they got it, we comin' to get it

[Chorus]
I got the key to the door
I got the key to the door
I got the key to the door
My nigga move keys of the dope (woo)
I got the key to the door
I got the key to the door
I got the key to the door
My nigga move keys of the dope (woo)
Whole thing for the 41, just bought a choppa for a hundred nigga
Hundred rounds, kill a hundred niggas
Fuck you and everybody runnin' witcha
I got the key to the door
I got the key to the door
I got the key to the door
My nigga move keys of the dope (woo)
I got the key to the door

My nigga move keys of the dope (woo)
Whole thing for the 41, just bought a choppa for a hundred nigga
Hundred rounds, kill a hundred niggas
Fuck you and everybody runnin' witcha
I got the key to the door

My nigga move keys of the dope (woo)
