[Intro]
Welcome to the mind of a Gemini
Where the duality is real
From moment to moment I can change how I feel
Come into my mind, come into my universe
Come into my soul

[Hook]
They say money change niggas, I don't know if that's true
I ain't got much but they think I do
Yeen my tribe I don't know about you
Mind of a Gemini no low IQ
They say money change niggas, I don't know if that's true
I ain't got much but they think I do
Yeen my tribe I don't know about you
Mind of a Gemini no low IQ
They say money change niggas, I don't know if that's true
I ain't got much but they thing I do
Yeen my tribe I don't know about you
Mind of a Gemini no low IQ
They say money change niggas, I don't know if that's true
I ain't got much but they thing I do
Yeen my tribe I don't know about you
Mind of a Gemini no low IQ

[Verse]
If a nigga owe me better pay up
Smooth operator with the lay up
Girl I ain't got time to lay up
T-shirt stained from the make-up
Liberate your mind if you really wanna wake up
5 times a day say a prayer
Nigga meditating like I'm in the Himalayas
Yeen got a plan then you planning to fail
Sending love to my brother doing time in the jail
Hard being black, white man give us hell
Hard getting rich when the hood still poor
Love turn into envy, friends turn into foes
Don't ask me why that's just how it go
Mind your business, keep your mouth closed
Been had keys unlock them doors
Game so cold talk a bitch up out her clothes
And my mind so high that it can't come down
If they didn't know then, well I bet they know now
Pull up a chair, everybody gather round
Mind of a Gemini set the world on fire
Hard being two people at the same damn time
Cracked that code and unlocked my mind
Gotta get on my grind, baby it's my time
Money can buy a lot of things but it can't buy time
I ain't feeling your vibe, yeen my tribe
I don't like rappers I done already tried
I ain't here to make friends, something I don't really hide
Reparations overdue, now I want my pie
Mind of a Gemini
I ain't feeling your vibe, yeen my tribe
I don't like rappers I done already tried
