Let it burn, (6x)

[Hook]
Light my blunt with a burning bill
They say I sold my soul. Well I guess it's real. Fuck a Bugatti
Need a hundred mill
And the way I feel, fuck how you feel
Burn my blunt with a burning bill
They say I sold my soul
Well I guess it's real
Fuck a Bugatti, need a hundred mill
And the way I feel, fuck how you feel

[Verse 1]
Lighting my blunts with a hundred nigga
You sold your soul for the money nigga
You was hungry nigga
They never want my nigga
I feel em' on me nigga
I feel em' hunt me nigga
I'm so lonely nigga with this chrome my nigga
Got the choppa And I'm finna act a donkey nigga
Get cold cased, whole clique get erased
When it come to the money
Boy I'm out for the case
So give me my slice before I take your half
100 mill, 50 mill, you do the math
On the road to riches but I had to take a cab
Trying to drink away the pain & forgot to pay the tab
And I'm getting pulled down and a bucket full of crabs
Niggas heard that I got sesame
Can't shit live if I don't let it breathe
Dumping shots out the forty in their neck till it bleed

Yeah!

[Hook]

[Hook 2]
Marksman and killers right next to me
Bow Down and pay some respect to me (this shits burning my lungs)
Rest in peace, in jeeps, you peace
(It's just the Ink)
Marksman and killers right next to me
Bow Down and pay some respect to me
(Evan pass me the light bruh)
Rest in peace, in jeeps, in peace

[Verse 2 ]
Marksman and killers right next to me
Bitch, Bow Down and pay some respect to me
No test in me. Bitches rest in peace
Pull up in jeeps. Boy I know where you be
You a money machine, you a ATM
In other words nigga, you a walking lick
Bitches on my dick
It's money over a bitch
Until the day that I'm rich
And nigga don't forget
If I ever go broke. I'm gone hit me a lick
Nigga take from the poor and they give to the rich
Man fuck that shit going out for this
When cop my gun I'll never bitch
Wreck my Bugatti left that bitch in a ditch
And I need a 100mil before they put me in a ditch
Now I'm riding around strap in my Honda looking sick
Smoking 100 bills
Ink burning my wrist
Symbolizing pain that a nigga went through
If I didn't rap to you, I'll be lying about this
Crispy 100 bills cutting my wrist
And the dirty money came off flipping them bricks
It's all blood money
Trace it back to my people
The almighty dollar makes us feel unequal
People killing people  I done seen so much evil
If you get caught slipping
You won't live to see the sequel

Go !
