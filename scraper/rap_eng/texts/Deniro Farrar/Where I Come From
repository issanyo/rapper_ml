[Hook: Deniro Farrar]
Life ain't promised to a nigga where I come from
Where I come from made me beast
Graduated from the struggle and I made it out the streets
Liberated my mind now it's time I teach
Life ain't promised to a nigga where I come from
Here to save everybody I can
But you gotta understand that I'm only one man
And we ain't no different
You just like me
Life ain't promised to a nigga where I come from
Where I come from made me beast
Graduated from the struggle and I made it out the streets
Liberated my mind now it's time I teach
Life ain't promised to a nigga where I come from
Here to save everybody I can
But you gotta understand that I'm only one man
And we ain't no different
You just like me

[Interlude]
Man fuck all that shit nigga pass me the blunt
Fuck all that Farrakhan shit you be talking
Yall niggas be sitting round this motherfucker all day nigga
Yall don't be doing shit
Look nigga, my daddy wasn't shit
My momma wasn't shit
Chances are nigga, I ain't gon' be shit

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Ride through the city where I come from
Where the kids see the killers as a role model
Don't nobody understand them and they feel alone
Hit the block, bought a Glock now they feel they grown
Unaware that he gon' get a bullet in his head
By another black male cause he living well
Got rich quick made it from a crack sale
Now he just another dead nigga shit oh well
But it's funny how we run into karma
Same boy killed he used to serve the boy's momma
And his daddy was the brick man so he got it honest
Never had it honest cause he never had a soul
Immune to the system, of the cold world
My little niece still sick, that my brother's little girl
If he lose her it would kill him
So it fuckin' with my world
Shit I'm drinking liquor every night till I hurl

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
Come ride through the city where I come from
Where them young niggas riding round with them drums
They ain't playing no games and they going on
Till the feeling when they kill and they so young
Everybody where I'm from ride with a Glock
You better keep it if you slip then you gettin' shot
Watch the murder rate rise while the bodies drop
Whole hood seen it happen, we don't talk to the cops
Sick of funerals and going to these wakes
Killing off each other while they laugh in our face
Judge gave 50 years for a dope case
While he watch the momma cry, tears roll down her face
Told him that he innocent, the judge don't believe 'em
Put 'em on trial then she threw away his freedom
No money for a lawyer
And he a felon look the judge in the eye
And I told that bitch he ain't tellin'
