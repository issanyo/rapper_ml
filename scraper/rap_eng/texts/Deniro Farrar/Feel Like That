[Verse 1]

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Thereâ€™s a whole lotta hoes, and a whole lotta niggas
Clint Eastwood with the fight is gorilla
Turn the warfare to a cold-blooded killer
Take a load off my mind with the paraphernalia
You not familiar, might end up dismembered
My heart equals the 31st of December
Got an ice box where my heart used to be
Whats so bad about ya, really never was for ya
In the first place, you got me in the worst place
Wanna get you at a slow pace, he turned into a coke case
Toe-ticking with no fix, procaine
Clutching the stick at the niggas who balding
November, out of lease, having you falling
Death that you caused is outta here
Outta this atmosphere, the captains here
Twenty-three to your front like a Cavalier
Mixed with Jim Carry, got a mask the tears
Like Paul Revere, gotta warn you all
? sweet like alcohol
Mushrooms is my adderall
Rest in piece to all locked dogs
Lido?, TT?, and China man, wait hold up
These niggas dont understand, how we do
(How we do it on the other side playboy)
Yall niggas dont understand how we do
(How we how we do it on the otherside playboy)
But you do when the gun is aimed at you
(How we how we do it on the otherside playboy)
Yall niggas dont understand how we do
(What can I do)
