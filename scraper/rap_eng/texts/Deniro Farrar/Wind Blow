[Chorus:]
Get my papers ready for the drought
Trying to make a route
Riding with a stap make a niggers want to take me out
Yea where i’m from niggers dont really make it out
I am wishing i was free like when the breeze blow
And I’m just another lion in the jungle
Gun fights and rumble
I bust my own color s
And i know from when niggers dont make it out
Yea i wishing i was free like when wind blow

[Verse 1:]
Mother fuck my PO finger to the CO
You asking me for dick for hitting niggers with the rico
Noodles mixed with cheetos can i get some burritos
Commissary stay straight shout out to my boy rico
Thugging with some niggers they really were my niggers
They wrote things on me the plots got thicker
I redo my motion confused feeling hopeless
These accusations bogus they lying and they know it
These niggers stress the truth like pilates or aerobics
Just to save there own ass because they don't want to take the fall
Like a motherfucking man so they snitched on their dog
Bitches around you when you ballin they always leave when you fall
I don't need no new friends bitches i fucked them all
Recorded on my Iphone and showed to my fucking dogs
Jail ain't no place to be niggers snitching like its cool
It's here men for themselves these niggers out here breaking rules
I wish i was free cause we slaves only street
Been harassed by these cops for having gold on our teeth
Niggers want to take my life that's why i’m riding with the heat
That's why i have the blood of Jesus
I know he watching over me
Should i fear no man but God even though he ain’t a man
I ain’t backing down from sheit you niggers bleed like i care
Young niggers choppers bought my city like iran
But we hustle just to eat fuck you if you disagree
Hustling in the drought trying to make a route
Grind strap banking niggers want to take me out oh yeah
Cause where i’m from they hope niggers don't make it out
Yeah wishing i was free like when wind blows
And i’m just another lion in the jungle
Gun fights and rumbles i lost my own color
And you know from when niggers dont make it out
I am wishing i was free like when wind blows
Fist fights and drama ghetto baby mama’s
Knocked up with no purpose sex without no condoms
Mass full of robbers they kids needs christmas
I’m getting scared of these murders i maybe another victim
These niggers in the system the judge trying to leach them
So free my brother too cause Lord knows i miss him
The police kill mi nigga they though he had a pistol
My niece starting to get noticed starting to look like my sister
My heart getting colder i’m starting to lose all my feelings
Fuck the mother of my kids but i take care of my children
I focus on my craft and now my better half
Two bitches want me my nigga do the math
My granny in the hood i’m trying to move her out
So she can see the world and i bought my momma that house
And saved to make advance to buy my brother out
So he can be free like when the wind blows

[Chorus:] [x2]
My paper ready for the drought trying
Trying to make a route
Riding with a stap make a nigga want to take me out
Yea where i’m from niggers dont really make it out
I am wishing i was free like when the breeze blow
And i’m just another lion in the jungle
Gun fights and rumbles
I bust my own color
And i know from when niggers dont make it out
Yea i wishing i was free like when wind blow
