(Intro: Duru The King)
Out on my own, building my name
So I can live on
Out on my faith
And I know that one day
We gon' live on

(Verse 1: Duru The King)
Dreamin' bout' currency
Down to die for a dollar
My mission is to make a million
Break it down with my niggas
Put licence on every pistol
They’re gonna hate you, little nigga
Don’t let them tell you nothing wrong
Coming from out the hood with dreams
Don’t even matter a dream
A dream is what I’m sellin’
Counting money is better than bitches offering pleasure
Momma know I be thuggin', affiliating with killas'
Touchin' bases with major lables, knowin' the world gon' feel it
Droppin hits, have you heard my latest nigga, I'm the realist

(Pre hook: Duru The King)
This song is for my ghetto babies
I come from out that ghetto baby
Just look at what the ghetto made me
I think it's up to me to save us
I'm that black 1980's baby
I get old with the 704

(Hook: Deniro Farrar)
And I do it for the set
Run yo' mouth get wet
Eastside in this bitch
Still throwin' up the set
I do it for the set, nigga

Run yo' mouth get wet
Westside in this bitch
Still throwin' up the set
I do it for the set, nigga

Run yo' mouth get wet
Northside in this bitch
Still throwin' up the set
I do it for the set, nigga

Run yo' mouth get wet
Southside in this bitch
Still throwin' up the set
When I walk in the set

(Verse 2: Deniro Farrar)
All the real niggas show me love
Bad bitches give me hugs
Fuck niggas get mugged
When I'm with my thugs
Talk that shit get (?)
Nigga don't fuck with us
Have a ho roll up my drugs
Got models all in my space
Fake smiles on my face
Pistol on my waist, cos where I'm from ain't safe
Don't get it twisted nigga
Still throwin' up my set
Talk that shit get wet
Just hit a lick for that cheque
Need about a hundred mil and I'm set
Drop the top on that Vet
I got two sons and they fresh
So hands down, I'm blessed

(Bridge: Deniro Farrar)
Eastside where I'm at
Westside where I'm from
That pistol on me right now
I ain't gotta go to my trunk

I said
Eastside where I'm at
Westside where I'm from
That pistol on me right now
I ain't gotta go to my trunk

I said
Eastside where I'm at
Westside where I'm from
That pistol on me right now
Don't go nowhere without my gun

(Hook)
