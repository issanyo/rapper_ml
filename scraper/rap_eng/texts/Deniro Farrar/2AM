2am on a Tuesday
Two hoes in a Jacuzzi
With intention to do me
Stimulated and groovy
Vaginal juices oozing
Competing to get the loosest
Banged 'em up like
In a gansta movie
Too tired to kick 'em out
Too lonely to be alone
Couple minutes later I got a call on the phone
Territory beef, my nigga say that it's on
He feeling like Al Capone
Who am I to say he wrong?
Even though I know he was
Slowly reach for my tone
Threw my Nike joggers on
Told them bitches to get gone
Can't leave in my spot
They might ramble through some shit
Had some money in the stash
Couple pounds in the stick
That they never knew exist
Can't put my trust in a chick
Only lame niggas trip
Tryin to impress a bitch
She textin her baby daddy
Like this nigga here lit
That's a whole nother story
Ain't got shit to do with this
I just thought I'd warn you niggas
'bout them hoes you kick it with
But anyway, enough of that
Let's get back to my story
I'm doin' a buck twenty
And I put it on cory
I ain't want to kill this nigga
But I knew that I would
I can't go out like no pussy
And show face in my hood
Caught wind of the story
But you know how that go
Shit either way
They violatin
Can't be breaking the code
Came through the hood sprayin'
Hit Leray with a K
Bootie told me he didn't make it
He took four to the face
Homicide asking questions
We don't fuck with the jakes
I walked straight past them bitches
With my Glock on my waist
They looked down for a second
Like they wanted to search
Pretty sure they seen that 40 poking under my shirt
All my niggas posted up
Ready to put in some work
He say he seen it happen
That's why blood on his shirt
Cousin told me he ain't sleeping
'til somebody got merc'd
[?] broke down
That's when shit got worse
[?]
Speeding off in a rush
I hopped in the car with cousin
Untucked the Glock from my gut
4am and we creepin
Hell, I'm supposed to be sleepin
With two bad naked bitches
But we gotta get even
Anybody can get it
I know we killin our kind
[?]
We ain't shootin up no houses
That's a waste of our time
Finally got to they hood
Hit the lights, ride slow
Made the left, seen them niggas
Cuz they'll say "there they go"
All them niggas got to running
Killed them all, no missing
Hell, we folk caused beef
And had enough ammunition
Told 'em get me right beside them
And I'm letting 'em feel it
I got closer and closer
Now I'm feeling the rush
Finger gripping the trigger
As I get ready to bust
I heard my son call my name
That's when I woke up

Damn
