[Intro]
Woo, woo, yo

[Chorus]
Chopper on deck, I spray that
All the way down, where you lay at
Pounds of the Cali just came in the mail
I don't trust my plug, I don't weigh that
Chopper on deck, I spray that
All the way down, where you lay at
Pounds of the Cali just came in the mail
I don't trust my plug, I don't weigh that

[Verse 1]
Chopper on deck, I spray that
All the way down, where you lay at
Pounds of the Cali just came in the mail
I don't trust my plug, I don't weigh that
Take your bitch and I won't give her back
Catch a nigga so low, like, "Where your squad at?"
Police pull out, searchin' me for a bag
Take all [?] raised to my city projects
Did it for my hood so you better stop dead
Got a pistol in your hand but you won't pop that
Nigga bust but he ain't even bust back
Made it in the hood where my killers might [?]
What it do? It's so niggas gettin' round there
Ride in the rental when I jump in all that
Days with the dope with my niggas in the back
When them choppers on deck, goin' straight like that
Take one the bricks but they can't like that
Trappin' in and outta trap, boys stay like that
Comin' with the fun and won't play like that
Bitch niggas in the hood get erased like that
Pick it up, chop it out
Chop it out, pick it up then I do the same thing
Switchin' up my route when I'm headin' to the crib
'Cause the niggas still in it (let's go!)
And I don't trust these niggas
Don't trust these bitches, don't trust myself (let's go!)
And I don't love these niggas
I don't love these hoes, only love my wealth (let's go!)
And for a brick, get the whites out (whites out, whites out)
Get [?] better white y'all (white y'all, white y'all)
I don't fuck with the fuck around
Let a nigga try me, get knocked down

[Chorus]
Chopper on deck, I spray that
All the way down, where you lay at
Pounds of the Cali just came in the mail
I don't trust my plug, I don't weigh that
Chopper on deck, I spray that
All the way down, where you lay at
Pounds of the Cali just came in the mail
I don't trust my plug, I don't weigh that

[Verse 2]
Bust it out the wrap then I weight that (nigga)
In the kitchen, whippin' these cookies (pussy)
Buyin', re-rock and the powder step though
It won't jump back when you cook it (rookie)
10 toes down, I don't know a fuck nigga
[?] screamin', that dude fuck nigga
[?] and it's still fuck nigga
Runnin' for a pay, I don't even wanna go (let's go!)
I'ma throw the cheeseburger down when they make me
Throw them bands (let's go, let's go)
Word jumpin' that [?] (let's go, let's go)
[?] (let's go, let's go)
Work, know a nigga gettin', gettin' work
He can't [?] then it's work
If a bitch wanna fuck, gotta suck me first
Just slippin' on bricks, somebody gettin' murked
Pick it up, chop it out
Chop it out, pick it up then I do the same thing (skrrt, skrrt, work)
Switchin' up my route when I'm headin' to the crib (work, work, work)
'Cause the niggas still in it
Don't trust these niggas
Don't trust these bitches, don't trust myself (work)
I don't love these niggas
I don't love these hoes, only love my wealth
Money over everything, money is the only thing
Married to the money so a nigga got a weddin' ring
Bad bitch wanna shotgun, then she gettin' brain
44, love my dogs
No, bang, bang
Bang, bang

[Outro]
Let me hear that back from the very beginning
