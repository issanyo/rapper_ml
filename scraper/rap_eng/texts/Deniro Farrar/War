[Chorus x2]
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll flip them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em
I said, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll split them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em

[Verse 1]
Nigga, it's a war going on outside
You don't got an army better join one
Got peers that'll kill and I'm on one
Swear to God, Uncle Sam don't want none
Put it on my hood, you fuckin' with the wrong one
Got a real short temper but a long gun
Nigga fuck a white flag that don't mean nothing
Got some cold blood killer like mean Russians
Chevy full a niggas on a scene bussin'
Police ask questions, we ain't seen nothing
Got a bullet for a snitch if he seen something
Homicide or murder nigga same difference
Catch him up in traffic while he lane switchin'
Chopper go to choppin', leave his frame twisted
Got a hundred fifty rounds and I ain't missing
Got a hundred fifty rounds and I ain’t missing
Nigga, it's a war going on outside
You ain’t a gun better get one
Niggas doing B&E's trying to steal one
Better keep your eyes open, nigga stay on it
GPS a nigga crib, we gon' to lay on it
Catch him out at public doing something dirty
Riding strapped with the .9 or the baby .40
Gotta beam on that bitch so you can't ignore it
Nigga, it’s a war going outside with the police and the government
But we all killing off each other and they loving it
Shit, it's kill or be killed, what am I to do?
Got me thinking ain't no future left for the youth
Young niggas don’t fight, all they do is shoot
Got me thinking ain't no future left for the youth
Young niggas don't fight, all they do is shoot (my nigga)

[Chorus x2]
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll flip them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em
I said, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll split them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em

[Verse 2]
Nigga, it’s a war going outside
You ain't got a vest better get one
Like germs in the air when that MAC sprayed
Bullets hit ya body, bitch you better act dead
Arms, chest, head, face, back, then his legs
Put the whole clip in him, gon' fill him up
Niggas acting like they real, they ain't real as us
Gunning down the police, we don't give a fuck
Shit, it's kill or be killed and they killing us
If you can't trust a government, who can we trust?
Fist-fighting in my hood made a nigga tough
Ain't no safety on the Glock, nigga gon' bust
Hundred rounds in the 'K, I ain't gotta aim
Get me close to the nigga, let me do my thang
Better have an umbrella when them bullet rain
Killed a nigga home, and now you gotta feel his pain
Nigga, it’s a war going on outside
Over territory on my side of town
You ain't from 'round here don't come around
If you ain't got permission, they gon' lay you down
Woke up and went to sleep to that chopper sound
Nigga we don't fuck around with the fuck around
Fuck around and we'll have ya ass ducking rounds
Got the dope money buried underneath the ground
Nigga, it’s a war going outside
You ain't got a lawyer better get one
Judge giving niggas life for a couple birds
While police killing niggas like we ain't shit
Middle finger to the law, they can suck a dick
Judge giving niggas life for a couple bricks
While police killing niggas like we ain't shit
Middle finger to the law, they can suck a dick (my nigga)

[Chorus x2]
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll flip them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em
I said, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll split them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em
