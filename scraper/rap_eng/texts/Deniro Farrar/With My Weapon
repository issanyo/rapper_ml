Yeah, KOBK, new generation, we got next, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm just ridin' round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done sold so much dope in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin' round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done fucked so many bitches in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done seen so much shit in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon

When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection and I'm just

[Verse 1: Duru Tha King]
Still, I remain the same
Stay in the game, create a new lane
And the niggas around me feelin the same
I remember bitchin when a nigga ain't even have a dollar to his name
Niggas don't wanna believe that KBG runnin the gang
From the crown to my head to my feet I plead the blood of Jesus
Yeah, that's over me and my people
Uh, hearing and seeing no evil, loaded this ? and choppa and bust in that bitch like it's legal

[Chorus]
I'm just ridin round with my weapon

When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done seen so much shit in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
Charlotte on my back, it is on my heels
Runnin from my past, grippin on my steel
Tryin to make it rap, it ain't payin no bills
Just give a nigga 30, and a tour with no appeal

Flippin packs knowing you won't make no meal
Niggas still hustle cuz they don't know nothing different
Now they runnin to them graves or they gettin locked in prison
They got me wanting better, nigga imma do better
This shit hard when you out here with no cheddar
Still tryna hustle but I'm seein I'm no clever
Beefin with them pussy niggas so I'm strapped with my Beretta

[Chorus]
I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done sold so much dope in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done fucked so many bitches in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done seen so much shit in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done did so much shit in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection and I'm just
