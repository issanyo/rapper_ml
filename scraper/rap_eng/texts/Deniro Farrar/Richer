[Hook]
I'm getting richer, I'm getting richer
Fuck what you say... I'm getting richer

[Verse 1]
Standing on the block all day with my Glock out
Life ain't shit to a young black dropout
Motherfuck a job, that ain't nothing but a cop out
Capsizing work but I used to play the watch out
Teacher couldn't teach me and the preacher couldn't reach me
My momma can't control me got too old for her to beat me
Lights was never on, had roaches up in my house
Still selling dope even though we know the cops out
Smoking in the hallway never skip class
I ain't even bother to go the teacher can kiss my ass
Always had ambition to be the richest in class
Me and my nigga gon' get with the pistol or a bass

[Hook]
Hard in the game
Had to do some things, had to do some things
Fuck what you say, had to do some things
I'm getting richer, I'm getting richer
Fuck what you say...

[Verse 2]
Then the work start booming, time start flying
Peers graduating but my niggas still dying
Rolling up a blunt told myself I'd be fine
Boy I swear my life a movie that I wish I could rewind
Niggas writing statements that ain't build to do the time
But you should've thought about that shit before you did the crime
Rap sheet long but I still tote my nine
Cause I'm caught up in the game I done made up my mind
Told momma not to worry, cause she stays stressing
God got my back and if he don't I got my weapon
Counting up my paper while I'm counting up my blessings
Doing what I got to do I take the heat of all my lessons
Gotta get rich that's my first and only goal
Standing in the kitchen with the baking soda in a bowl
Chevy on 24's with a mouth full of gold
Dope dealer in his prime with the biggest bankroll

[Hook]
Hard in the game
Had to do some things, had to do some things
Fuck what you say, I had to do some things
I'm getting richer, I'm getting richer
Fuck what you say...
