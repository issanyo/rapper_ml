[Intro]

Chorus x 2

Thugged out and all my niggas gangster
I ain't friendly nigga I don't fuck with strangers
All I know is Danger
Fuck around and you gon' feel that banger
Hit you from a mile away they long rangers
All I know is danger

[Verse 1]

All you hear is bang, bang
They banging on my block
Oh Lord, oh my, somebody dun got shot
Now all you see is them choppers
Somebody finna get chopped
This murder shit don't stop
We retaliate no spot
Don't nobody talk to the cops
Niggas live by the code
Let's find out where they're staking
Shit, I know somebody gone know
And I know somebody know something
All them people outside
How the fuck none of y'all ain't seen nothing
Load them choppers nigga let's ride
I got homocide on my mind
Four deep and we ride
And in them chevy's nigga we flying
Hurt so bad my nigga I'm crying
Ain't no music and ain't no talking
Shoot the first nigga walking
In they hood, on they street
I'mma get them while none get me
I hit two my nigga hit three
Won't be the end of this beef
Im on pills don't need no sleep
Eyes up open up by the week?
Bitch it's dangerous where I've been
Dangerous where I roam
Always on point
Don't go nowhere without my chrome
And it's danger

Chorus x 2

[Verse 2]

Because all I know is murder
All I see is crime
Get the fuck from out of dodge
When bullets go the flying, better D-U-C-K nigga
Try your luck you think I'm lying
And you be riding in that hearse
Laying in a box that's pine
It's a hazard to your health
Don't you ever fuck with mine
Bitch I'm strapped up with that nine
And it shoot about thirty times
I got killers on my spor
That will knock you out for free
And I put that on [?]
Rest in peace my nigga look beat
Charlotte nigga trigger happy
20 murders in a week
Every time I watch the news, shit that's all the fuck I see
Another dead black male, just a victim of the gun
Nigga at age 21, see them choppers better run
Niggas ain't shooting to scare
They ain't shooting for fun
Niggas been killing for so long to the pain they go numb
Niggas knocking out your brain, then they living on the run
I'm strapped up all the time, won't catch me without my gun
Bitch you know it's danger

Chorus x 2
