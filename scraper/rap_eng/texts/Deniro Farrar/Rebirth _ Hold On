[Part 1: Rebirth]

Lord, forgive me ‘cause the way I’m living
They say what goes around comes around
I’m gonna get what’s coming to me
Guess I’ll be strapped up till they lay me down

And I done did too much to say
I never go to church and barely pray
Lately I’ve been going through some things
Hell, what the fuck I’m supposed to say?

‘Cause I just had two baby boys
I’m always calling their mama’s out their name
When I get caught in my emotions
Lord, I swear I’m tryna make a change

Ain't wrote my brother Tune in the month
But I’m always texting with these hoes
Feel bad whenever he call my phone
He had a court and I ain’t even show

And my little brother looking up to me
Lord, I swear I ain’t no role model
My uncle a fucking alcoholic
Can’t even eat unless he got a bottle

I been stressing about that money lately
It got me ‘bout to rob a fucking bank
And my mama fuck with bitches now
I could judge her, but I really can’t

‘Cause the way I’m living ain’t no better
I said the way I’m living ain’t no better
I just got in beef with what’s his name
So now I’m riding strapped with my Beretta

[Part 2: Hold On]

Laying in my bed, can’t get sleep
Eyes wide open and I’m staring at the ceiling
99 problems but I really got a million
You don't know my struggle so don't tell me that you feel it
Spit it from the heart, I know they gonna feel it
I was born real so cowards gonna feel me
Watching my back ‘cause I know they wanna kill me
Don’t go nowhere without my semi
Daddy was a killer so the bloodline in me
Heart of a lion even though a nigga skinny
Come to my hood and you gonna see plenty
Matchbox Chevys with the hubcap missin'
Niggas on dope walk around all timid
Dope dealer pass through the hood in a Bentley
Never gave back to the hood where he from
So the niggas from the block where he from gonna get it
Niggas get money and they act like bitches
Niggas get money and they act like bitches
Till they head get bust and they ass need stitches
Blinded by the greed so you better pay attention
Money don't make you real, my nigga
Better learn the value of a motherfucking dollar
'Fore them young hungry niggas break you off something proper
City of the Angels where they ride with them choppers
Eat, shit, sleep and even die with the chopper
I ain’t got nowhere to go, my nigga
Got beat down to the floor, my nigga
Hurt so bad and it show, my nigga
They kept saying that I wouldn't be shit
‘Cause I grew up so poor, my nigga
Well I’mma tell y'all like my nigga tell me
Water seeds long enough and they'll grow my nigga

Laying in my bed, can’t get sleep
Eyes wide open and I’m staring at the ceiling
Never go to church and my momma’s feelings hurt
Praying at night ‘cause she know that I’m sinning
Best coming so you know I gotta get it
Money coming fast so you know that’s how I’m spending
I ain't got credit so the whips I'm in when I drop out work boy you know that they rented
Unmarked car keep riding through the hood, with the Feds in the town and they might be in it
Niggas on tha westside just got bopped with a couple of 'em blocks so they might be snitching
Calling my phone, wanna talk about business
Ain't it fucked up because I smell something fishy
Everyone's fucked, tryna handle my business
Trigger finger itching and my eyeballs twitchin
All this work in the goddamn kitchen
Everytime I cook up, a nigga get nauseous
Peepin out my blinds because the chopper feelin cautious
Runnin from the law, got a nigga so exhausted
That's all I know my nigga, young hardhead and it shows my nigga
Money be the root of all evil, you gotta watch your people Sometimes you don't know them niggas
But that's how it goes my nigga
Got beat down to the floor my nigga
Hurt so bad and it show, my nigga
Lick went wrong off both my niggas
They kept saying that I wouldn't be shit
‘Cause I grew up so poor, my nigga
Well I’mma tell y'all like a nigga tell me
Water seeds long enough and they'll grow my nigga
