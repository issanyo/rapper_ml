[Verse 1, Deniro Farrar]

I don't do favors for niggas
I fucked den you payed her, my nigga
That shit ain't player, my nigga
My neighbor the mayor, my nigga
That mean that my paper legit
That mean that my business in order
You pay her, I pay her no mind
I can't be wasting my time
Cuz I got mountains to climb
Places to go
And women to fuck
They running from us while we running it up
Got all the game and I'm soaking it up
Fuckin it up boy I'm fucking it up
None of you niggas is hotter than us
Try to play tough and I'm busting you up
Locking us up with no key to the cuff
Now the media eatin it up
Tried to erase us by giving us cases
Threw us in court with no representation
Boy I'm a soldier
My solider mentality
Be the reason why these people is after me
Bounty on me they never gonna capture me
Catch 'em slippin' they gon' wind up a casualty
Round table, breaking bread with the faculty
Ballin' like athletes
Niggas be hella jealous
Writin statements they be tellin tellin
Most of my niggas convicted felons
Still ridin' around with they weapon
Fuck a draco got a sig on me
And your bitch face
Got my kids on it
Send my young niggas at your wig homie
If you niggas ever tell the pigs on me
YUHHH

[Hook x2]
Fuck all that talking, my nig
Fuck all that talking, my nig
We don't do talking, my nig
Let's get this shit poppin, my nig
Niggas be hella jealous
Writin statements they be tellin tellin
Most of my niggas convicted felons
Still ridin around with they weapon

[Verse 2, Trent the Hooligan]

Fuck all these politicans
That be politicking
Man, I stuck my dick in while the clock was ticking
Buzzer-beater
Motherfuckers always hated to see her
I was the one
With the power to kill
But the power and will
That I had was a lot for a brother to take
Motherfuckers taking L's to the face
I ain't got time to get high
I can barely get by motherfucker
What the fuck you thinkin'
I'm drinking, I'm drinking a lot of the water
My future daughter won't be stressing 'bout shit
Wrapping it up
Then i dive in a bitch
I'm divine in this bitch
Still ain't got time in this bitch
Still looking fly in this bitch
Don't you lie in this bitch
I be the type that get live in this bitch
And Then die for a bitch
Motherfuckers got me fucked up
Thinking I won't pop the trunk up
I ain't never been a bitch, boy
Compromising for a bitch, boy
I got my shit together
In this gloomy weather
Motherfuckers tether they emotion better
Grab umbrella
Together we stand or
Divided we fall
Fuck it I ball
Shout out my brother Damarious
I felt like leaving the O was preposterous
I was just moping around 'til I picked up the pen
And I practiced my penmanship
Now I be penning shit
And I be killing shit
Fuck negativity
I practice diligence
I want a million
For all my children
I don't want nothing to do with you period
End of discussion
