KIRA what's happenin?
DuRu I see you
Magic, tell em watch that lean

[Chorus]
I strive to do better (baby)
I'll die before I let em (change me)
I'll die before I let em (change me)
I strive to do better (baby)

[Verse 1: DuRu Tha King]
Now I know how putting on feels
Niggas don't do it like I do it, so excuse me
Stepping on stars fuck a bitch from Mars
Gotta keep that five drop six in the bong is really what you heard
Is really who we are who would ever think I'd make it this far
Look at their faces mama I made it standing ovation
Yeah I remember y'all used to talk about me
Now them same niggas and them same hoes wanna hang around me
Now watch me lean while I lean lean while I do my thang clean
And I'm stacking cream this was all a dream
Still I ride (still I ride)
And stay high (and stay high)
Don't know night (don't know night)
But get life (but get life)
We alright (we alright)
Now watch me lean while I lean lean while I do my thang

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
And that bitch can't tell me nothing (and that bitch can't tell me nothing)
Nigga I feel like stunting (nigga I feel like stunting)
And that bitch can't tell me nothing (and that bitch can't tell me nothing)
Nigga I feel like stunting (nigga I feel like stunting)
Now watch me lean while I lean lean while I do my thang clean
And I'm stacking cream this was all a dream
And the bitch can't tell me nothing (bitch can't tell me nothing)
Nigga I feel like stunting (nigga I feel like stunting)
So what fools be humble
You can hear me come
My ? be flow
Flow like my car running
Watch out for them jackers trying to run me off my burner
And I'm fresh from out the mall, so it make no earning
30's on the whip, ain't no scrubbing when I'm turn it
Watch me lean while I (watch me lean while I) now your bitch get nervous
Cause I drive fast like I'm always in a hurry
And my fur seat on recline blowing purple pine
You know my bitch dime there's thirty in my nine
My pistol got no holster all my niggas killers
Please do not provoke them they will bum one of you niggas
And I'm on my way to mine VIP eternal
DONTREZZ that I throw up Purple Kush and I roll up
Watch me lean (watch me lean, watch me lean) better stay in your place
Cause that 40 ho ? bust that bitch up in your place

[Chorus]

Now watch me lean while I lean lean while I do my thang clean
