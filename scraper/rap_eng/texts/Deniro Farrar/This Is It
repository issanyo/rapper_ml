[Intro: Deniro Farrar]
Cliff of Death nigga
Life or death nigga
If you have a silver spoon then we are not the same
I'm a product of the drug game

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
16 years old I was on the block
Fuck a education I was selling rocks
Seventeen I bought a AK-47
Then they killed my nigga Corey hope he up in heaven
Just a nigga with a dream tryna make it rappen
Addicted to the drug money tryna make it trappen
Wet work to the dry set it in a napkin
Lost niggas in the system don't know how it happened
Pockets got fat now I'm paying rent
At my momma crib stashed my pistol in the vent
She said a hard head make a soft ass
I don't give a fuck I'm rolling blunts and skipping class
Eighteen years old caught my first charge
Late night on the block hanging with my boys
I ain't have a childhood,never played with toys
Momma did all she could but I made the choice
I'm a hustler

[Hook: Child Actor]
Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah
Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah
Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah
Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
I was nineteen working with a whole peak
Never had a daddy so a nigga ran the streets
Hit licks with some niggas did some B&E's
But they stand me in the back for the fucking cheese
Caught some cases now I'm stressing about them lawyer fees
Tryed to work with them crackers but they lawyer me
Got the surge,ran right back to the streets
Pledge allegiance to the game with my loyalty
Greedy for the money ain't nobody shorting me
Bitch I'm broke so why the fuck he extorting me?
Problem child momma wishes she aborted me
Tears running down her eyes while they cuffing me
Just a nigga with a record they'll love to see
Not amount to shit what a damn shame
If you have a silver spoon we are not the same
I'm a product of the struggle and the dope game

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Deniro Farrar]
My nigga I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But if you out here in these streets and you making moves
Trust none and make sure your on your p's & q's
Watch them niggas that you serve,gotta pick and choose
All money ain't good that's a lose-lose
Don't be petty out here hustling for no tennis shoes
Don't be fronting all your work when the rent due
And if you keep coming short that's an issue
Watch what your saying homie cause your line tapped
Serving work out your crib get your kidnapped
Don't you ever give a nigga an unloaded strap
Seen a nigga take his closest homie off the map
My nigga I'm just telling you what I done seen
Can't sleep cause I keep having bad dreams
Everywhere I go its like a gotta watch my back
Paranoid don't go nowhere without the mac

[Hook]

Said you always saw it
