[Verse 1]
She said that I'm a sex god
And my dick is her religion
I hit it from the front, from the back, from the side
We be making up positions
I told her she's a goddess
And I worship her body
I wanna kiss you from your feet to your thighs
To your nipples, all the way up to your eyelids
Come and take a seat, I'ma kiss it
Taste so sweet when I lick up
I devour the flower for about an hour
Make you shower in the bedroom
Come and, take a seat, on my missile
Wanna go deep, make it trickle
I wanna eat and beat it and treat it like a real G is supposed to (G is supposed to)

[Hook]
Ooh, don't stop
And ooh, don't stop
'Cause I love the way you do it
When you do it like that
When the only thing known is the man by the bed

[Hook]
Ooh, don't stop
And ooh, don't stop
'Cause I love the way you do it
When you do it like that
When the only thing known is the man by the bed

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
We started in your bedroom (we started in your bedroom)
Now we all up in the kitchen (now we all up in the kitchen)
I pick you up by your waist
Just to put you up on my face, let me lick you (on my face, let me lick you)
She know that I'm nasty (she know that I'm nasty)
But I know that she like it (but I know that she like it)
Ain't nothing fake about that cake
I blow them candles out and then I eat that icing
We be making up positions (we be making up positions )
A nigga go deep when I dig her(deep when I dig her)
Got my hands roun' her neck
Now her bed soaking wet, oh yeah it's official
Come on take a ride on my missile (come on take a ride on my missile)
We can go tour out of spice
Ain't nothin wrong with the lamp
I can see every expression on her face (expression on her face)

[Hook]
Ooh, don't stop
And ooh, don't stop
'Cause I love the way you do it
When you do it like that
When the only thing known is the man by the bed

[Hook]
Ooh, don't stop
And ooh, don't stop
'Cause I love the way you do it
When you do it like that
When the only thing known is the man by the bed

[Verse 3: Deniro Farrar]
Girl, I'm gonna be impatient
Sick and tired of waiting
Skip the foreplay
I'm just trynna see you naked
Begging me to stop 'cause your body can't take it
And I'm kissing on your thighs
'Till your legs start shaking
Girl, I'm with it if you're with it
I'm down if you down
So roll another blunt
And we can go another round (round)
Shorty say my dick is her religion
Got her on her knees like she prayin' for forgiveness

[Hook]
Ooh, don't stop
And ooh, don't stop
'Cause I love the way you do it
When you do it like that
When the only thing known is the man by the bed

[Hook]
Ooh, don't stop
And ooh, don't stop
'Cause I love the way you do it
When you do it like that
When the only thing known is the man by the bed

[Hook]
Ooh, don't stop
And ooh, don't stop
'Cause I love the way you do it
When you do it like that
When the only thing known is the man by the bed

[Hook]
Ooh, don't stop
And ooh, don't stop
'Cause I love the way you do it
When you do it like that
When the only thing known is the man by the bed
