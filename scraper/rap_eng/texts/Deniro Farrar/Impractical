[Hook]
I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care
I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga, without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care

[Verse 1]
They hollerin' get my bread up, I own the bread truck
Acting like they got it and they got me fed up
Every day a different bitch another set of problems
Plug showed love, niggas hated and they robbed him
So I'm riding solo with this .38 revolver
Never been the friendly type, ain't got a lot of friends
Death around the corner so I bulletproof the Benz
Careful who I'm letting out and cautious who I'm letting in
Hard trusting humans, did dirty by my kin
Smiling in my face but really don't want me to win
Been dealing with that type of shit guess it'll never end
Niggas start developing envy now the bullshit begins
Who are you to tell me different bout this life I live
I don't trust a soul, that's why its cameras in my crib
Lady did me dirty she was 'posed to be my rib
Can't have no expectations, guess it is what it is
Know to be destructive, lately I've been trying to build
Like working on my G.E.D and I just bought a crib
Sick of playing catch-up I done lost too many years
Done with all the running now I'm facing all my fears

[Hook]
I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care
I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga, without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care

[Verse 2]
They ask me what the business, they knowing the signs
Police planting drugs on me but they know they ain't mine
Thinking death around the corner so I roll with my nine
Mama praying all the time, she just hope that I'm fine
Bout to lose my fucking mind, ain't no trusting my kind
Overtime on my grind, got no time to unwind
Everything I got is mine, I just took me a trip
And they killed my niggas Flip for a brick of that whip
I ain't even get the work and thats what's fucking me up
Roll them dices long enough and you gon' run out of luck
Son mama trippin' on me, I ain't made it with rap
I'm just trying to stay focused, can't go back to the trap
Family tell me all the time keep my faith in the Lord
I been praying night and day but now I'm feeling ignored
Pussy niggas packing pistols but they never gon' use 'em
But still gon' get they head bust, that's just how real niggas do them

[Hook]
I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care
I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga, without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care
