[Verse 1]
Sick of putting work in the plastic
Off-white work, Michael Jackson
Sick and tired of running, ducking, dodging these cases
Down to kill a nigga when it comes to big faces
Going in a fuck nigga mouth, no braces
White girl cocaine crazy
Let her snort lines till' her body start shaking
Feelin like a raver in the 80's
Can't get money, these fuck niggas talking
If a nigga cross em', my shooters gone off em'
Living like kings, maneuver like bosses
Want everythang, we ain't takin' no losses
Light turn green, better hope you ready
Selling break-down my nigga that's petty
Straight drop, dope, make the fiends go crazy
Stealin' from they family, abandon they babies
First of the month, fuck you, pay me
Gotta get money, I just had babies
Gotta get money, cuz the fuckin' rent due
Aim at ya' head, nigga won't miss you
Ridin' in the rental hand on my tool
Paranoia like a bitch, still doing what I do
I don't really want to, but I feel like I gotta
Main bitch be holdin' me down, she a rider
Don't need scales for the work, I'm an eyer
Straight from the mudhouse, built this empire
Couldn't keep a job, shit, I always got fired
Turn to the streets, then a nigga got hired
Servin' all this work, got my name on fire
If your bitch made it, somebody gone try her
Make a couple mill, maybe then, I'll retire
Smoke 10 blunts, won't get no higher, bitch

[Hook]
Tired of robbin' (Tired of hustlin')
Sick of dodgin' (Tired of duckin')
Sick of fussin' (Tired of fightin')
Done with rappin' (Tired of writin')
Tired of robbin' (Tired of hustlin')
Sick of dodgin' (Tired of duckin')
Sick of fussin' (Tired of fightin')
Done with rappin' (Tired of writin')
Tired of robbin' (Tired of hustlin')
Sick of dodgin' (Tired of duckin')
Sick of fussin' (Tired of fightin')
Done with rappin' (Tired of writin')
Tired of robbin' (Tired of hustlin')
Sick of dodgin' (Tired of duckin')
Sick of fussin' (Tired of fightin')
Done with rappin' (Tired of writin')

[Verse 2]
Sick of putting weed in the bag, smokin' cigarettes till my mouth taste ashy
Can't see me, fuck nigga need glasses
30 rounds in the Glock 40 this plastic
Tryna' make my last 20 stretch like elastic
Hood hot and the police harrasin'
Threw me on the ground and they talk to me nasty
Holes in my shoes and my blue jeans ashy
Can't get a bitch, Imma live with Ashley
She in love with money, so the situation tragic
I'm a broke nigga, so we always clashin'
Dropped outta school, shit I was barely passin'
Used to be an underdog, now I'm like a captain
Grew up in the streets, yeah, I never had a daddy
Payed a couple bills, tryna' make momma happy
But she say money never bring satisfaction
How the fuck you know? We ain't ever had it
Flyin' on my rug and I'm feelin' like Aladdin
Smokin' this kush, making me lag
Heart start beatin', heart start collapsin'
Baby on the way, bout to be a pappy
Gotta leave the trap and make this rap happen
Ain't gotta job, she always askin'
Shit I'm tryna' make lil baby girl happy
But she ain't happy nigga, but I'm happy with her
Work hard tryin' not to be a savage nigga
Sick of livin' my life like an average nigga
Spendin' money really hard, tryna stack it nigga
Sick of puttin this work in the baggin' nigga
Play with my money, imma smash it nigga
Chasing this cash got me so tired
Smoke 10 blunts won't get no higher
Bitch
