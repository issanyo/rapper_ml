[Chorus x2]

Baby tell me what you want
Tell me what you feel
I can make you [?]
Something that's real
Half on the baby
I can pay your bills
If you ever hungry, you can have my meal

Rollin' like a coaster
Gun in the holster
Smooth when I approach
Intellect focused
Baby girl noticed
Other niggas hopeless
Elevate her mind
Now she open like a lotus
I ain't gotta fuck to make your mind [?]
Had a climax and I didn't even have to touch
Body activated
She loving my patience
Threw the pussy at me
But we better off waiting
Want me so bad
Now she begging me to taste
Fucked her so good she ain't had that [?]
Even though we separate
Our souls came together
Got music, incense
Make her feel special

Half on the baby
I pay the rent
Locked eyes once
Been connected ever since
That was ten years ago
Now we almost thirty
Unafraid to grow
A little age won't hurt me
Scrambled up them eggs
Butt naked in the kitchen
Bend her over just to lick it
Fuck it if we break the dishes
Food getting cold
Heat it up and remix it
No pun intended but baby we can't kick it
Damn you look good
And your body like a vixen
But I got a lady baby so this ain't the right time
Maybe next night time
When we turn to butterflies
I don't even smoke weed
But you got me so high

[Chorus x2]

Baby tell me what you want
Tell me what you feel
I can make you [?]
Something that's real
Half on the baby
I can pay your bills
If you ever hungry, you can have my meal

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you feel
Couple months late
It is what it is
Treat you like you [?]
Baby you can have my ribs
Cheated all the time
But I swear that I'll stop
Bought a bunch of land
Just to grow our own crops
The love gon' continue
Even when my heart stop
Got me reading to your belly top
Baby girl drop
Fell in love with you like you was hip hop
And I'm dealing with duality
You know I feel flopped
You love both sides
And for that I gotta thank you
Bad on purpose
Because you love when I spank you
Known for destruction
But baby I want to build
Brick by brick
Like a brand new crib
Mama don't like you
Brother want to fight you
None of that matters
Baby, because you still [?]
I had sons when I met you
And they looked just like me
But that ain't the point
I'm getting off subject
Swimming in your body
Backstroking in your tummy
Love the way you taste
Baby it's so yummy
When I first met you
I was plugged out and slummy
Now I'm liberated
And I'm getting to the money
That ain't why you with me
You don't care about the money
Even when the scene dark
Your love made it sun & shit
[?]

[Chorus x2]

Baby tell me what you want
Tell me what you feel
I can make you [?]
Something that's real
Half on the baby
I can pay your bills
If you ever hungry, you can have my meal
