It's called gentrification
It's what happens when the property value of a certain area is brought down
Huh? You listening?
To bring the property value down
They can buy the land at a lower price
Then they move all the people out
Raise the property value
And sell it at a profit

[Hook: Deniro Farrar x2]
I'm just a boy from the hood
I feel like Furious Styles
Gentrification in our ghetto this nation is ours
We built this shit
Yeah, yeah we built this shit

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Losing our ghetto but we don't even know it
Only use the curb for the liquor we pawn
Nigga got shot now it's time to mourn
Is what it is baby life move on
Gotta love struggle cause it made me strong
Whole Foods in the hood now the rent got raised
But I'm still living off minimum wage
Nigga can't even afford to stay
Next thing you know they gon' own the block
Shit too high for the mom and pop
Stores we was raised on on the block
Now we gotta make way for a coffee shop
Can't take shit so they buy the land
Living next door to the fireman
And a couple with a dog but they don't even speak
Walking round acting like they better than me
Cause they make six figures with a college degree
I grew up around Hades and apartments to me
Steady jacking up the price but you gotta be cheap?
Motherfuckers ain't fooling me
I love my skin and I love my soul
We was all slaves that's the lie they told
We started out kings with diamonds and gold
But they took our shit baby ain't that cold?

[Hook: Deniro Farrar x2]

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
Where we gon' live if it ain't the hood?
Can't move up cause a nigga poor
Still in a recession and the jobs is low
Only other option is slang some blow
Three strike rule better think again
Kicking us out and they moving in
Pushing us all to the side of the city
Full of liquor stores and the water's shitty
School fucked up they don't teach the kids
Bout who they is or what we did
Alien ain't build them pyramids
We the ones started the beauty supply
People bought it out now prices are high
Everything around me gentrified
Better wake up nigga open your eyes
Go and get high then you eat Popeyes
But there ain't enough time to lay on our side
Cross they fingers cause they hope we die
Must've forgot we was born to survive
Only in the hood when you need a vote
Or fucking our women in exchange for dope
Same old shit it ain't changing though
Feeling like God my only hope

[Hook: Deniro Farrar x2]

We are African
And we happen to be in America
We're not American
We are a people who formerly were African who were kidnapped and brought to America
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock
The rock was landed on us
