Yeah
COD 2 nigga
Free Tune
If'it ain't right, it ain't right

[Hook]
And I've been chasing this money so long
That a nigga ain't had no sleep
Residue on the scale from the powder
AK by the dope for the beef
And I've been chasing this money so long
Been a week since a nigga been home
And I'm cutting fish scale with the fish
Soon as they won't call me then it's gone
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Real street nigga 35 for a brick
Sell it for the forty one made a flip for the 6
Moving all night breaking down shit
I be coming through the check with my down ass bitch
Crib in LA nigga so is my gun
If the feds come for me then I'm going on a run
Told mama 'bout the stash for the bills and the bonds
Told my baby mamas take care of my sons
Credits better give me I ain't turnin their shit
Taught em how to straight scale but it's really re-rock
Fuck around get pumped like a pair of Reeboks
Niggas out here weighin why so I'm shuttin down shop
E'ery know I'm makin bop so I'm clutchin my Glock
Mama said I need to quit but I ain't gon' stop

It's in my blood and I got it from my pops
Yeah I got it from my pops

Break it down flip it
Nigga wanna cook then he gotta come get it
Catch another work tryna see more digits
Marathonin' through the check, call em rubber band benny's
I don't fuck with the codeine or the molly
I be on point cause them other niggas sloppy
Ten four fuck, nigga roger that and copy
Got my head on the swivel
And my finger on the trigger of the motherfuckin' shotty

[Hook]
And I've been chasing this money so long
That a nigga ain't had no sleep
Residue on the scale from the powder
AK by the dope for the beef
And I've been chasing this money so long
Been a week since a nigga been home
And I'm cutting fish scale with the fish
Soon as they won't call me then it's gone

Yeah

[Verse 2]
Real street nigga 35 for a pound
Got a place for them hoes that ain't even touch down
Sell em hold I ain't breakin nothin' down
Nigga say he want five on the other side of town
Try to rob me and Imma lay ya ass down
Gotta thumb through the check funny money goin' round
Back to the hood cause I'm east side bound
Got a chopper and a trap and it hold a hundred rounds
Notha' nigga play me how the fuck that sound
I be thuggin like illegal, breaker breaker where my people
Stand squad up in the regal for the workin' desert eagle
Nigga say he want beef but I ain't no vegan
Wolves in my hood when they hungry Imma feed em
Fuck these niggas I don't trust em I don't need em
I don't love these hoes I pack em I don't eat em
Bitch can't get shit from me with my peter
In the kitchen with the fish where I'm clutchin' my heater
Fam by my seater but nigga then I beat'er
And she do what I tell her cause she know that I don't need'er
Got a crib in NY with a pus and the reefer
Got my bands off I ain't gotta pull em out
And I don't rob reals cause they make me stand out
Broke ass niggas always callin' for a handout
Come with that fuckery and it'll be a man down

[Hook]
And I've been chasing this money so long
That a nigga ain't had no sleep
Residue on the scale from the powder
AK by the dope for the beef
And I've been chasing this money so long
Been a week since a nigga been home
And I'm cutting fish scale with the fish
Soon as they won't call me then it's gone

[Outro]
So long...
Chasing...
