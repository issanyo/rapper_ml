So we ride just fall
Shoot us down while we crawl
Throw us up against a wall
'cuz they don't give a fuck about you
And they don't give a fuck about me
So it's fuck the police

So we ride just fall
Shoot us down while we crawl
Throw us up against a wall
'cuz they don't give a fuck about you
And they don't give a fuck about me
So it's fuck the police

The system playin games
They lock us up in chains
If slavery abolished
Why it all look the same?
My brother doin' time
He was lost and caught a body
The boy he killed was white
Shit, they tried to give him life
But let a cracka kill a nigga
He be out that same night
Made this song for the [?]
I pray for you every night
When a pig shot your brother down
They know that wasn't right
A young black male had him scared for his life
Tried to assassinate his character
That shit that got me tight
Kill a nigga like it's nothing then go home and kiss your wife
Tell me how you sleep at night?
Wrong is wrong, right is right
The judge ain't know your situation
But he still gave you life
How's this a jury of my peers?
All these motherfuckers white
Do I look white to you?
Hell no, I'm a nigga
And my hair won't get nappier
And my nose won't get no bigger
Screaming mother fuck the police
With my finger on the trigger nigga

[Interlude]

[Chorus, 2x]
We killing off each other
They just sitting back watching
Slaving all week
Spent your whole check shopping
Worse, your humanity equal money in they pocket
They want to take us out
But that's a whole nother topic

Ran out of options
I just started bank robbing
Took an L, went to jail
Told Mama I was sorry
Money on my mind
And that's all that I see
I don't need Uncle Sam to be all I can be
Melanin soldier
All you motherfuckers weak
Screaming fuck the police
They [?]
The Klan resurrected
Cuz all that I see
Is the police looking down like they taller than me
I'ma stand firm
I ain't never backed down
I ain't never run
So I'ma run now
Beating on my chest
With my head to the clouds
I was born king my nigga
I say it proud
They don't give a fuck about us
Pay attention
Niggas buying J's
They buying private prisons
Liberate the people
My nigga, I'm on a mission
America's nightmare
Young, black, and I'm gifted

[Chorus, 2x]
We killing off each other
They just sitting back watching
Slaving all week
Spent your whole check shopping
Worse, your humanity equal money in they pocket
They want to take us out
But that's a whole nother topic

[Outro]
