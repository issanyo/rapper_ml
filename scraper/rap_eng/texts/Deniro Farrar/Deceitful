[Verse 1]
See ya later, what she told me
And she hopped out my car
I'm a nigga in my eyes
But to her I'm a star
See I ain't that type of nigga to go hang at a bar
I hit the hood to buy a sack just twist up a 'gar
Fallin' victim to desires, that ain't taking me far
What's the point of being known
If you don't know who you are?
Shit, I'm just a ghetto baby that's in search of some love
Only time I hit up on her, is when I want her to fuck
See that pain in her eyes,I be making it rough
She camplain about her job cause she ain't making enough
Got a baby at the crib, that she don't even own
They gentrifying the ghetto, now she losing her home
I'm a part of the problem, shit I know that I'm wrong
Got my lady at the crib and she love me to death
I'd took that all for granted, now there ain't none left
Say I'm gonna make a change, but to my word she deaf
Damn

[Interlude 1]
The most disrespected woman in America, is the black woman
The most un-protected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America, is the black woman. The honorable Elijah Muhammed teaches us to respect, our women, and to protect our women
We will kill you, for our women

[Verse 2]
Raised in the hood, but that ain't your fault
Niggas do the same thing, expecting different results
Definition of insanity, better hope you don't die
What's the point of having knowledge if it never applies?
Momma stressin' 'bout them bills, sick of watching her cry
I was born with the guilt, shit I know I'm a leader
What's the point of having power if you're hurting your people?
Definition of a nigga, if you're good or you're evil
On my seventh lifetime, and I'm fully conscious
Fuck religion cause I feel it apply to conquer
Got corrupted by the street, turned into a monster
Can't sleep, when you feel that holy spirit haunt you
What's the point of having love, if you don't love yourself?
Kept my distance from my feelings, they no longer there
Praying for my innocence, cause now I wantin' them back
But once they're gone, shit they're gone
I'm just telling you that, damn

[Interlude 2]
Who taught you to hate yourself
From the top of your head to the soles of your feet?
Who taught you to hate your own kind?
Who taught you to hate the race that you belong to
So much so that you don't want to be around each other?
