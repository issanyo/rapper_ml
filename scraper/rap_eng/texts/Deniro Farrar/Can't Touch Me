They with this, they with that
Ain't nobody ready to die for this shit

Glock man, Glock
Drop the top on that Audi
Niggas saying that they thugging
I really doubt it
Rappers sell they soul for a bag of that money
If you pussy I'm gon know
Cos I'ma smell you coming

Police can't touch me
Them bitches wanna fuck me
PO wanna lock a nigga fucker up
Middle finger to the laws i don't give a fuck

Tell them bitches if they want me they can come and get me
I ain't going by myself, they coming with me
They trying to send me and my niggas ...
...the police ...shooting niggas ...

I don't need no introduction, niggas know me
Ain't no secret, I don't fuck with the police
Ronald Regan is the reason why the dope cheap
Now the feds in our hood doing dope sweeps
Tell the judge i got kids and we gon eat
So if you give me 50 years what they gon be?
Guess the apple don't fall far from the tree
I ain't finna write no statement, fuck copping plea
Mandatory sentence make it hard for a g
My lil brother caught a body, he got 23
Hard trying to find a job with a felony
Why you thinking that Iâ€™m breaking pounds of this weed
Shits real I got bills and mouths to feed
Get you hit up for a fee, I ain't got to beef
Niggas gotta pop e just to pop and squeeze
And you can tell the police please to back up off my N-U-T's (appreciate)

To my PO and the judge they can suck a dick
Militant nigga, i'm on that soldier shit
My niggas down to die that's who i'm rolling with
And if she ain't got no mind then i don't fuck a bitch
Once i liberate the people then it's over with
Had them killers at your door on some Jehovahs shit
Tell the government to come get me if they really want me
I did this song right here for ...
Put us on the news saying that we thugs
Police start shooting us in cold blood
Feds trying to take our brothers from their babies
99% conviction rating, you know that's shady
They said government assistance made our people lazy
But if they take that shit away how is she gon feed them babies?
If the record labels want me then they have to pay me
I got that bag now I'm dealing school for our babies
