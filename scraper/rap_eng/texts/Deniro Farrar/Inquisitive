[Verse 1]
We livin in a time
Where the police are killing us
And they don't consider it crime
Hungry for attention
She starving in the mind
Searching for a god
Not lost, show a nigga signs
They be rappin' with no message
Guess they do it for some shine
Fuck what you believe
I'm serious when I speak
Slang in my speech
Just to reach 'em when I teach
Best-kept secret
I'm no longer a mystique
I have one foot in the game
I have one foot in the street
Wash my hands with the trap
Had to rinse and then repeat
Obstacles in my way
I would not accept defeat
Cuz nigga I've been hungry out there
Living on the street
Had holes in my clothes
And the shoes on my feet
Look what I became
What they said I'd never be
I sit my hustle on the bench
Cuz them laws tryna play us
Break my heart to see them sell again
Fuck out they bodega

[Chorus]
So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of [?] selling alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine
So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of Christians selling alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine

[Verse 2]
And I'm just living life [?]
Taking everything that's mine
Me and her against the world
She watch my back
I got her spine
Accountable for everything
I spit off in my rhymes
Sick of living on my feet
So it's time to make a climb
Money the root of evil
And them trees keep on growing
They say marijuana legal
Tell them pigs, free my homies
They tryna knock the hustle
And the government condone it
They was tryna feed their family
They [?] paid they rent
Ever since the war on drugs
Shit ain't been right ever since
Up in Denver Colorado them
The white boys getting rich
But them niggas in my ghetto
Getting murdered over cents
[?]
With all the evidence
I sit my hustle on the bench
Cuz them laws tryna play us
Break my heart to see them sell again
Fuck out they bodega
Shake my head and walk away
Close your eyes and say a prayer
To whoever you think is there

[Chorus]
So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of [?] selling alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine
So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of Christians selling fucking alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine

[Verse 3]
And I'm kicking that knowledge
I'm spitting that knowledge
I'm tellin' you niggas it's real
Dedicate this song to Cory
Lost his life behind the wheel
Never heard the full story
Just a victim of the steel
Having vivid memories
Of [?]
Left them babies in the world
All alone, feeling confused
Better get your life together
For the same happen to you
All the shit that I been through
Come walk a mile in my shoes
And you will see why I'm so real
And got the passion like I do
Had to save my fuckin' self
Because I wanted to save the youth
I used to have these talks with [?]
Then I seen him on the news
Pray for guap and pray for g
Shit big boss say that's my plug
Screaming free my brother tune
That's my motherfucking blood
Fuck the DA and the Judge
Tried to drag him through the mud
All this hatred in the world
Just ain't no magic it's true love
I sit my hustle on the bench
Cuz them laws tryna play us
Break my heart to see them sell again
Fuck out they bodega

[Chorus]
So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of [?] selling alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine
So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of Christians selling fucking alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine
