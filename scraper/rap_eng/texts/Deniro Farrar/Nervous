[HOOK 2X]
Ridin with that nine on me
Cause all my niggas dying on me
Federalies spyin on me
You live by the gun
Nigga you die by the gun nigga
Better know this

[Verse 1]
I don't let nobody tell me who I can be round
Ever since I came up everybody want be round
Fuck Uncle Sam
Im gon be all I can be now
Thinkin you can fuck with me
Must be stupid, thats senile
You got all that power
Time to practice what you preach now
Living life by lines
I got everything in reach now
Fuck her till this morning
Then I gotta tell her peace out
Cuz I'm on a mission
Gotta liberate the street now
World gettin colder
Everybody packin heat now
If you ain't my tribe
My nigga you cannot be round
I been on a mission
Nigga hit it now I got it
My niggas rob a capitol one
Whats in your wallet
Them pirates be on watchin
They waitin on your deposit
Ain't nobody stoppin me
Nigga I got that knowledge
Feelin like I'm Hughy P. rest in piece
Marcus Garvey
If ever I offended you my nigga
I am not sorry, (bitch)

[HOOK 2X]
Ridin with that nine on me
Cause all my niggas dying on me

[Verse 2]
Wanna know respect
Your pistols no matter the situation
Pull that draco from out the cut
And get to quakin
Police killin us for no reason
They do it daily
Better get your ladies some pistols
And get to prayin
Muscle, imma run this money
If you think im playing
Fuck donald trump
He the modern day ronald reagan
Word to the wise
Take heed to what I'm saying
CHEM trails over the hood I see em sprayin
Money is they god
I see the look on their faces
Racist fuckin devils
Their power come from their waist
Pulled you for speedin
Now its pistol in your face
Better start packin my nigga and play it safe
Poison  in the food but we eatin it anyway
Look at all the cancer, people dying every day
Wanna shut me up but I got too much to say
Better let me in the game
Somebody made a mistake
This is fate nigga

[HOOK 2X]
Ridin with that nine on me
Cause all my niggas dying on me
Federalies spyin on me
You live by the gun
Nigga you die by the gun nigga
Better know this

[outro]
I dont think imma die from spittin on a piece of ice
I dont think imma die because i got a bad heart
I dont think imma die because of lung cancer
I believe that I'm going to be able to die
For different things that i was born for
I believe that i will be able to die high off the people
