Fuck like I love her
In the morning I be gone
Called and I ignored her
Now she blowin up my phone

Nigga this how felt when we wrote juice
Stuck to the script
Now I'm starring in the movie
Women used to diss me
Now they follow in my movement
Nigga pay attention
Let me show you how I do it
All about the money and power
Nigga I get it
What's the point of that
If you ain't working on your spirit
Keep all your excuses, baby
I don't want to hear it
Death is all around us
It ain't nobody I'm fearing
Niggas finna pay attention
Fuck my pockets [?]
Tribe all around me
Everybody with me shooters
Nigga kill a G
Now I'm ridin' with the ruger
Got me searching for peace
I meditating like the Buddha
Praying for forgiveness
Because they know they did me wrong

[Chorus]
Fuck like I love her
In the morning I be gone
Called and I ignored her
Now she blowin up my phone
I say knick, knack, paddywack
I hit her with the bone

Everybody changing
Cuz they know a nigga on
Story of my life
This ain't just another song
Coolin with the people
Nigga that's where you can catch me
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head, nigga that's me
Story of my life
Can't nobody tell it but me
Dissin all the women that ain't used to want to fuck me
[?]
Now I'm getting money
Everybody say they love me
Story of my life
Can't nobody tell it but me
Dissin all the women that ain't used to want to fuck me
[?]
Now I'm getting money
Everybody say they love me

[Ade Adisa's Verse]
You just know my name
But you don't know my story
There's way too many gimmicks
These rap niggas corny
They asking where I been
Cuz I been out the mix
Just stayin' out the way
It keeps me out of shit
I hear the small talking
I see the phony fives
I can't respect a man
That can't look me in the eyes
Run and tell these rap niggas
It's time for you to change your career, feel
I see these niggas still running on the treadmill
Heading nowhere fast
And I bet you say you fucking stole for that cash, huh
These niggas opportunists
How could you say we ain't never helped you
Run out of gas
We run you out and shelfed you
We gon' be alright
Either way it goes
I embrace my imperfections
There's nothing to expose
I can't respect these rappers
Because they be on that ho shit
Loyalty is real
So don't hit me with that bro shit
I told Deniro keep your feet on solid ground
You gon' be the one to make it
Don't let 'em bring you down
Put your soul in that music
And know doubts and hesitation can affect your execution

[Chorus x2]
Story of my life
Can't nobody tell it but me
Dissin all the women that ain't used to want to fuck me
[?]
Now I'm getting money
Everybody say they love me

[Outro]
