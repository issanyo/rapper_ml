[Intro]
Nothing so blue as a heart in pain
Nothing so sad as a tear in vain

COD 2, man
Realest shit I ever wrote, nigga
Free Tune
[?] cult

[Hook]
And I got so much pain in my soul
I'm drowning all my problems with this liquor, the devil keep coming back to me
I can't tell them no
My friends turn foe, got to watch these niggas cause they hoes
Nights mama cried
All of them shoots outside, with them niggas got kid, I could've died
But he can't be alive
And I still wonder why, staring down the barrel of my 45

[Verse 1]
What's life to a nigga that don't want to live?
What's to be in need to a nigga that be breaking into cribs?
Ever been so fucking hungry, you can see your ribs?
Hit a lick for your nigga, to help him pay his bills
Nah, I don't think you've ever been through it
Wanted to kill him but you couldn't cause you were kin to him
Wouldn't kill if somebody put an end to him
Beat him down, do him like grown men do him
Nigga, I'm just spitting facts
Fucking 'round these bitches, hoping they don't get a tax
Born with a heart, but I had to give it back
Ain't no love on these streets, learned that selling crack, nigga
Cause my mama was a thief
And my daddy was the king
Using bitches and putting them on his team
He never had much, but managed to stay clean
Guess that's why I love shoes and designer denim jeans
I'm a fucking monster, something to deal with
But a problem nonetheless
I'm spitting that real shit
Nigga we the generation that's taking over the world
Got no love for these bitches
Gave it all to my girl
Let the world drink a liquor, taking shots 'till I hurl
And you know I'm hollin' "Free Tune!"
They gave my brother a bond, you know we gotta get them
I'm actively seeking paper, so dope become a victim
I told Jill stay in school
Idol time is the devil, my nigga, don't be a fool
Guess that's why I'm serving packs and riding 'round with my 2

[Hook]
And I got so much pain in my soul
I'm drowning all my problems with this liquor, the devil keep coming back to me
I can't tell them no
My friends turn foe, got to watch these niggas cause they hoes
Nights mama cried
All them shootouts outside, when them niggas got killed, I couldâ€™ve died
But he kept me alive
And I still wonder why, staring down the barrel of my 45

[Verse 2]
What's pain to a nigga that be numb to it?
What's a pack to a trapper that just run through it?
My nigga, ain't nothing to it
I grew up without my daddy, I can't put my sons through it
But my problems still pouring in
Fucking different bitches in every city I'm touring in
I thought I never had fans
Cause I come from the city with choppers like Iran
I remembered being bullied bullied by Jordan and I ran
To my big bro Rio, made me fight him like a man
I was scared but I really had them hands
Jumped out the porch on Citrus, sold grams
Made my first forty, ain't look back since
I was in it head first, nigga couldn't tell me shit
Dropped out of school to chase dead presidents
Public housing, fist fighting, smoking blunts till I'm bent
And that was back when Dominique had that neon
And Brian creak apartments while my brother shotted Kian
Heard them gunshots, tires screeching up the block
Ambulance and the police, the violence never stop nigga
So what's problems to a nigga that be having problems?
And what's beef to a nigga that live with his chopper?
All alone, he never had no fucking mama
So all he know is pain, murder, and the fucking drama
