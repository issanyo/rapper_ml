[Intro] Deniro Farrar
Oh, you thought that was your bitch (Naw)
She was fucking off the chain (And you know it)
Friends will be the ones that'll fuck you
Shit'll never be the same (Fuck 'em)
Oh, you thought that was your bitch (Bitch)
She was fucking off the chain
And your friends be the ones that'll fuck you
Shit will never be the same

Hook [Magic Fades]
I don't do what I'm 'spposed to, what I'm 'spposed to do?
I don't fuck who I'm 'spposed to, who I'm 'spposed to do?
I got loose ends, but I try to make the most of 'em (Most of 'em)
I got loose friends, most nights, I just try to ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
Ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
G-Ghost on 'em
Most nights, I just try to ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
Ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
Ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
Ghost on 'em (Better know it)
Most nights, I just try to ghost on 'em

[Verse 1] Deniro Farrar
Old friends turned into enemies
New niggas say the got my back, Ion know about that
Treat my new girl like my old bitch and my side ho caught feeling I ain't never caught back
Feeling like my heart got a hole in it
Everybody looking for a [?] (Fuck 'em)
I ain't ever did what I'm 'pposed to
I'm just fucking all these hoes cause I care, not
I just wanna know if her pussy good, she wanna know where my heart at
I said, "Baby don't be crying over spilt milk. Bitch, we will get to the bridge when we cross that."
Everybody got they own demons
A nigga got ghost now nobody can see me
Tying up loose end screaming fuck a new friend
I just want a new Benz, minaj, with 2 friends
Hoes that I knew, back then, ion know now
Niggas that I know now, I ain't know back then
I can feel it closing, everybody posing
Playing my games, bitch, just play your part
Catch a verdict, nigga, got me walking in the dark
Watching my back got me stabbed in the heart
Fuck who you close to, bitch, I can't hold you
I'm fucking who I want to and not who I'm supposed to be fuckin'

Hook [Magic Fades]
I don't do what I'm 'spposed to, what I'm 'spposed to do?
I don't fuck who I'm 'spposed to, who I'm 'spposed to do?
I got loose ends, but I try to make the most of 'em (Most of 'em)
I got loose friends, most nights, I just try to ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
Ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
G-Ghost on 'em
Most nights, I just try to ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
Ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
Ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
Ghost on 'em (Better know it)
Most nights, I just try to ghost on 'em

[Verse 2] Deniro Farrar
We ain't close like we used to be
We don't talk like we used to talk
We don't fuck like we used to fuck
Girl, you and me walk like we used to walk
Tryin' to fall asleep while my eyes wide shut
Never been in love cause my heart too cold
Old friends crossed me, I don't trust a soul
Drink away my problems, smoke away my pain
Niggas say I changed but I've always been the same
Catch a verdict, nigga still walking in the dark
Watching my heart got me stabbed in the back
Watching my back got me stabbed in the heart
Tyin' up loose ends, put 'em in a knot
Bitch niggas always talk about what they ain't got
Hate behind my back cause the really wanna spot
So I fucked they main bitch 'till her pussy start to fart, aye
Money bring friends but friends don't bring money
You ain't talking 'bout that, you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
Gossipin' ass bitches always talk about something
And them pussy niggas 50 but I always been 100
Watch me get ghost, they be sick to they stomach
Wussy, you ain't fighting for it if you don't want it
Tap my name on that pussy, let me know that I own it
Niggas trickin' on these bitches but I [?]
I just pass 'em to the homies

Hook [Magic Fades]
I don't do what I'm 'spposed to, what I'm 'spposed to do?
I don't fuck who I'm 'spposed to, who I'm 'spposed to do?
I got loose ends, but I try to make the most of 'em (God damn)
I got loose friends, most nights, I just try to ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
Ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
G-Ghost on 'em
Most nights, I just try to ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
Ghost on 'em (Ghost on 'em)
Ghost on 'em
Most nights, I just try to ghost on 'em
