[Intro]

[Chorus x2]
Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
Been riding with my pistol
Since my homie got shot
Baby telling me come home
But my home is the block
This the life a nigga chose
So is you rollin or not?
Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
I've been screaming fuck the system
Since my brother got locked
Mama tell me go to church
But I'm chasing this guap
And I ain't serving no new faces
That's how niggas get bought

[Verse 1]
Give you two for a quarter
Give you four for a fifty
Ain't enough for me to meet you
If you want it, come get it
Can't be cuffing these bitches
Once your partner done hit it
Red beams on all the pistols
But my partners ain't missing
We got choppas and dracos
Money made me an A-hole
Step on that fucking work
And stretch it out like this play-doh
Mad Max with a peso
Molly [?]
Score a movement like monsters
Drink Cabernet with the posse
Niggas say they some killas
But they ain't on the motion
Daddy left me and mama
I hit the streets wide open
Servning junkies their water
Smokin' blunts with my brother
Say a prayer for my mama
Cuz Lord knows she be stressing
I cut out most of my niggas
Cuz they wasn't one hundred
Tune writing my letters
Say he got caught with a shank
60 days in the hole
He told me brother [?]
That's why I'm snapping on niggas
And going hard in the paint

[Chorus x1]
Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
Been riding with my pistol
Since my homie got shot
Baby telling me come home
But my home is the block
This the life a nigga chose
So is you rollin or not?
Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
I've been screaming fuck the system
Since my brother got locked
Mama tell me go to church
But I'm chasing this guap
And I ain't serving no new faces
That's how niggas get bought


[Verse 2]
Give you two for the fourty
Give you four for the eighty
Doing what I got to do
Just to provide for my babies
Mama say that I'm lazy
Cuz I won't get a job
Before I work for nine dollars
Mama, I'd rather rob
Told her straight to her face
Looked her dead in the eyes
And said my daddy was a gangsta
Tell me, why you surprised
Dumpin work in the kitchen
I be baking them pies
Had a run-in with them laws
Told them nothing but lies
Name on some paperwork
You still shoppin for dope?
Well, you ain't welcome in this trap
I ain't gonna tell you no more
Mama tell me go to church
But I'm too deep in the game
Here religion and racism just one and the same

[Chorus x1]
Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
Been riding with my pistol
Since my homie got shot
Baby telling me come home
But my home is the block
This the life a nigga chose
So is you rollin or not?
Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
I've been screaming fuck the system
Since my brother got locked
Mama tell me go to church
But I'm chasing this guap
And I ain't serving no new faces
That's how niggas get bought
