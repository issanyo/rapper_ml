[Verse 1: Haleek Maul]
(Fuck you kill my nigga?)
Haleek killer killing them, I seen it all
But I seen no god, guess that I’m alone
I guess that you're alarmed if you ever see my face
Never met the demon spawn that’s my ace spitting rage
Problems I can’t solve
My mind should go fuck y'all
Driving that top trot and I’m faced with a brick wall
Now the G a life for me
Girlie blow the dice for me
Probably rip your whole click to bits with this rhyming scheme

[Hook]
We be the infamous ya heard of us
Pop pills nigga motherfucking swisher something

[Verse 2: Haleek Maul]
Dark shit coming for your (?) bitch
Burn out your apartment
Please don't try to start shit
I'm already pretty fucked up in the head
But Sup Cuts give me cred
So I killed that shit
Fucking stabbed that shit ‘til I’m content
Voices in my head
Paranoid as hell
Sweating out this world
Tell my girl I’m leaving it
Shit she don’t exist
I guess she’s just a myth
Just like a model father figure
Shit I’m switching shit
Put that shit in a coffin before y'all niggas try to start some shit
Beefing just the meat dish
Best heat it with that 45 clip
Ain't trying to see that shit
But I Stevie on that shit
Plead the fifth up on that shit
Make the system work for me (ha)
This is post rap post love post breakup post drugs post norms
Fuck the game we taking it
And throwing the charred carcass off the boat
After we rape the shit
Fuck ‘em

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Deniro Farrar]
They say thou shalt not kill
On them pills I feel like Satan bitch
Why you scared? You made me this
You don’t believe what I believe?
Well I guess that makes you atheist
Pardon me; where’s my respect?
I walk around on church ground with satanic crosses around my neck
So truthfully, I ain't got it all
Real talk I’m throwed off
Overdosed on Adderall
Snorting all this Tylenol
Too insane to be sane
Normal: all this fucking pain
No remorse and no shame
Whenever I let my gun rain
Driven off of cocaine
Paper bag full of spray paint
Crazed nigga with a AK
Ready to cause some mayday
I'm seeing all though my seeing eye
Sacrifice and that get me by
Drinking blood ‘til it get me high
Can’t sleep, I’m trying to think of why
I just watched my soul fly
Right in front of my fucking eyes
Sold that bitch in the nick of time
Satan bout to give me mine
Oh it’s fuck me?
That’s how that’s gon’ be?
Well hell bout to freeze over, nigga
Ain't no bitch in me (go!)

[Hook]
