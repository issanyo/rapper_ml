[Intro]

Three o'clock in the morning, leaving the club horny
Callin' any broad I think woke and I'm on it

[Verse 1]
Trying to maintain that shit that be hangin' with Patricia
But Patricia always hatin' on me cause I fucked her sister
Mr. Hit-'Em-And-Never-Call-'Em-Back, a cold-hearted man
Hoping I can reach Tamika cause she down with all of that
Smack her ass, pull her hair, she love to get it from the back
Hit me with a text sayin' that she wanna sex me
I told her, "Bring some lingerie" if she wanna impress me
Bitch, fuck all that talking, just get over here and neck me
She started reachin' for the door like she offended by the joke
Settin' her bra down on her bed and started kissing on her throat
Getting closer to the pussy, ready to get in this shit
Pull her panties to the side, and bitch is on her period
Tell me you ain't serious, this shit is priceless
Told her, "Get to sucking, bitch, and do it like you like it"
Dumbass broad is stupid but I wish I was a psychic
If I'd known she was bleedin' then she wouldn't have got invited
Got a nigga all excited, erectin' up my private

[Verse 2]
I can't get no pussy so right now I'm feelin' violent
I know you trying to go and hope your pussy got some malice
I'm dead-ass serious, bitch I ain't smiling
Then I hit her with the "what the fuck you mean 'no?'
I ain't trying to hear this shit
You ain't trying to suck the dick, then I'mma call the other bitch"
Acting like you ain't a dog, I know you let my cousin hit
Playing like you had to do it when you know you ain't shit
Nympho for the sex, can probably take eight dicks
Scrolling through these bitches like an iPod playlist
Ran across Jasmine, that redbone waitress
Ass like Trina with some lips like Megan
Good, classy broad but she still good
Layin' right under her man and I really wish she could
Come over and fuck me on my sofa
I'm almost out of options and I'm feelin' like it's over
For me to get some pussy cause it's almost a quarter to six and my
Hand in my dick, thinkin' about using my wrist
Pissed about this shit, I can't let it happen like this
Seen a call that I missed, and I hope that it's worth it
Hesitate to call her back cause she say she a virgin
But today you 'bout to learn how to bust that pussy open
I ain't jokin'

[Verse 3]
Heard a knock at the door, thankin' God like I'm spiritual
Hopin' that she wanna fuck, the situation critical
Gotta play my cards right and treat it like it's pivotal
Plus I'm drunk as hell and I'm a horny individual
Netflix on the couch, chillin' in the living room
Started kissing on her neck, she had the nerve to tell me move
I hit her with the stare face, "bitch, what you tryna do?"
She told me she just wanna chill
I told her, "oh, for real?
It's six o'clock in the morning, ho, and you know what it is
This ain't no talk-show, and you ain't look like Oprah
So hike that dress up like a sinner bitch and let me stroke ya"
I heard her suck her teeth, then she rolled the fuck over
Turned the TV off on her ass, hit her with the cold shoulder
This story far from over, and I am far from average
She say she practice abstinence, waitin' for the marriage
I told her "let me eat the pussy, we ain't gotta have sex"
Stop right before she came, her legs still around my neck
Now her ass drippin' wet, fiendin' for a cigarette
Ask me if I had a rubber, all I could think was yes
Ran her tongue down my neck, started suckin' on my meat
"Tell me 'fore you 'bout to come so I can spit it in the sheets"
Hit her with the OK, but you know how I do and freak
Before you know it I'm bustin', jizzin' all on her teeth
She punch me in the stomach, she mad, I guess it's time to go
Walked her to the door and said peace and fell asleep
(Bitch)
