(intro)
Staring Down The Barrel of a loaded .45
Trying to find the courage to pull the trigger but why
Don't nobody understand what i feel inside
Trying to ease the pain so i started getting high
Tell me

(Meghan Tartamella)
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me, yeah
Can you feel the rain
Can you ease my pain

(verse 1:Deniro)
Staring Down The Barrel of a loaded .45
Trying to find the courage to pull the trigger but why
Don't nobody understand what i feel inside
Trying to ease the pain so i started getting high
Drowning out my sorrows
Empty liquor bottles
Sitting in my room daydreaming about tomorrow
Running out of time all of a sudden its tomorrow
Change for my change cause my piggie bank is hollow
Morning for them dead we pour out them liquor bottles
Drifting off in space while the rain tap on my door
Oops i meant window side effect of this indo
Trying to write a tempo to a subtle instrumental
Praying for the rain but it came and drown me ten fold
Wishing it would go away nights i forgot to pray
The rain cam and kept me safe
Iv'e cried all my tears away
I guess there's nothing left for me to say
I just wish the rain go away

(chorus)
Staring Down The Barrel of a loaded .45
Trying to find the courage to pull the trigger but why
Don't nobody understand what i feel inside
Trying to ease the pain so i started getting high
Tell me

(Meghan Tartamella)
Can you feel the rain
Can you ease my pain
Can you feel the rain
Can you ease my pain

(verse 2:Deniro)
Yo
Staring Down The Barrel of a loaded .45
Trying to find the courage to pull the trigger but why
Don't nobody understand what i feel inside
Trying to ease the pain so i started getting high
Problems with some trap friends, soon they multiply
Walking in the rain with my head up high
Running from the thunder gun clap's n' heavy metal
Guppies in the stream and the devilish ?????
Trying to get a grip on stability i let go
Strippers rain dance in the hopes that i would let go
Money that i earned used blood tears and sweat for
You can't learn to love it then i think you need to let go
Raining on the way don't forget to get you poncho
Rain coat the umbrella whenever that you need for
For pain for this bad weather
Nothing left for me to say...I JUST WISH IT ALL GO AWAY

(outro)
Staring Down The Barrel of a loaded .45
Trying to find the courage to pull the trigger but why
Don't nobody understand what i feel inside
Trying to ease the pain so i started getting high
Tell me
And im Staring Down The Barrel of a loaded .45
Trying to find the courage to pull the trigger but why
Don't nobody understand what i feel inside
Trying to ease the pain so i started getting high
Tell me

Yuh
(Meghan Tartamella)
Can you feel the rain
Can you ease my pain
Can you feel the rain
Can you ease my pain
Tell me you love me
Can you feel the rain
