[Intro]
World on my shoulders
Heart getting colder, sons getting older
Gotta raise 'em to be soldiers
Teach 'em morals and values
Keep your pistol for these vultures
Cause everyday you close

[Hook]
And I got the world on my shoulders
Heart getting colder, sons getting older
Gotta raise 'em to be soldiers
Teach 'em morals and values
Keep your pistol for these vultures
Cause everyday you closer

Name a crime and I done done it
Trying to get some money, cause it wasn't coming
Fast, shit I was hungry
Tired of being bummy, and treated like a dummy
How the fuck you got my back nigga, If you always frontin'?
Told my sons if they gon' do it, then do it like you love it
Say a prayer for my auntie cause she still get beat by her husband
Family don't mean shit to me, unless they about my cousin
And if we control our destiny, well I guess I had that coming
And school was never for me, cause they ain't wanna teach me
Got passed with failing grades cause they ain't think I was gon' be
Who I am today, I did this shit with no degree
They destroyed our community and the violence be unity

[Hook x2]

And the felonies they ruined me, nigga this ain't make believe
Got corrupted by TV to worship all this vanity
Selling dope to all my people, fucking with my sanity
Fighting with these demons and I swear they be commanding me
Gotta take control cause I know its a better man than me
Nigga be yourself cause that gangsta shit ain't impressing me
Prison or an early grave, there wasn't much left for me
I managed to stay out they way, I figured out the recipe
I only talk to bosses so you workers stop addressing me
Made it out the hood without no phony niggas next to me
Winded by my problems, all these bill collectors stressing me
But I still got my crib doe, somehow the Lord keep blessing me
Chopper need bullets, sons need pampers
Niggas got so many questions but they rarely find the answers
Chopper need bullets, sons need pampers
Niggas got so many questions but they rarely find the answers

[Hook x2]
