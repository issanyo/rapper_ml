[Intro]
Reese Forte

[Chorus: Deniro Farrar & Jayway Sosa, both]
No religion for a drug lord, oh, life sentence to a kingpin, oh
Put me in the Trap Hall of Fame, MJ six rings then, hey, no
Makin' plays like Phil Jackson, no, feds wanna bring the team in, oh man
Got the Jewish lawyer for the case, yeah, hold the chopper, better eat your face, yeah
No religion for a drug lord, oh, life sentence to a kingpin, oh
Put me in the Trap Hall of Fame, MJ six rings then, hey, no
Makin' plays like Phil Jackson, no, feds wanna bring the team in, oh man
Got the Jewish lawyer for the case, yeah, hold the chopper, better eat your face, yeah

[Verse 1: Jayway Sosa]
Life sentence to a kingpin, so my dogs tryna stay out the way (Stay out the way)
And you know how niggas be gettin' when they envy, the first nigga play I'm gon' take off his face (Play I'm gon' take off his face)
Street religion, I'ma pray with the chopper and give all the bullets to fade (I pray)
This a hope, not a story, now all odds against you, you rockin' this ice just to cover the pain
And they tryna put that injuction against us, this the label that done started the game
Most of these niggas just set up for fame
Shoot out with the opps til' the nigga a stain, yeah (Brrt)
Yeah, [?] fam is I never changed
Yeah, they takin' game [?] and we had to charge that shit to the game
We lost Tone and E, all to the same occasion
Ridin' out on a fuck nigga, tried to leave his ass on the pavement (Boom)
Same year when we lost Watts, had me thinkin' God pickin' favorites (Why?)
Givin' up tryna talk to 'em and I think the devil tryna take us

[Chorus: Deniro Farrar & Jayway Sosa, both]

Bricks goin' for the twenty-one

Upgraded to the thirty though
Move smoove when I got it on me
'Cause that muhfucka dirty though
Coach stepped on too much
Reason why you gotta bloody nose
Tap dance [?]

Trap house full of drug works
Sellin' off-white life Virgil
No religion for a drug lord, life sentence for a kingpin
Put me in the Trap Hall of Fame, MJ six rings then
Makin' plays like Phil Jackson, feds wanna bring the team in
Homie Jewish lawyer for thecase, fifty racks on it not guilty
Strapped up, nigga, I ain't lackin'
Bad bitch ridin' wit' a package
Takin' trips on the Greyhound
Got rich sellin' breakdown, bitch
