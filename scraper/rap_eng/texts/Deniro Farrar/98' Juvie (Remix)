[Verse 1 - Well$]
It's been me and Alec doin' hand-to-hands
And you can cut the shenanigans
Hardest niggas doin' it
Unless you got another synonym
I can't talk unless you penciled in
I done got my grandma famous
Fucked around and grandma made it
I don't give a damn who you came with
I been rocking with the same eight
My cousin fightin' the same case
Orchestratin' hits and we ain't even in the same place
And you be out of a job if me and Alec in the same state
When you mashin the gas, they not producin' at the same rate

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I wouldn't get in, they said I wouldn't get in
But my niggas got in my nigga
And I know what's on the map, and I be showin' my ass
As a result of the past, my nigga
And I done heard it all
But you ain't heard a foreign nigga with a southern drawl
Came up on mama cooking [?]
Got my niggas in the back plottin' how to take it all

[Chorus]
That this life ain't free, this life ain't cheap
You can live like a man, you can die on your knees (nigga choose one!)
That this life ain't free, this life ain't cheap
You can live like a man, you can die on your knees (nigga choose one!)

[Verse 2 - Deniro Farrar]
I done seen it all, big time kingpins fall
Real niggas turn into broads
Everybody shooters but they be the first snitchin'
Accidentally killin' tryna show off for the bitches
They gave homie life, that ain't none of my business
Bussin' down pounds in the trap, let's get it
On 85 dirty, my 40 got extensions
Fuck the other side, tell them niggas I meant it
If they want a war, tell them pussies I'm wit it
K got a drum and it hold a buck fifty
Hell freeze up before a nigga paint me pussy
Just hit the plug cuz he move like a rookie
Jack with no mask, now them niggas know who took it
Word around town that I'm fuckin' with them cookies
Bags of that gas if your homeboy lookin'
Trappin' out of state, catch me up in Brooklyn
Money over bitches, niggas killin' over pussy but I'm good though
Niggas need permission just to walk through my hood though
I'm a hood nigga so you know I got a hood hoe
I be everywhere that them niggas wish they could go

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I wouldn't get in, they said I wouldn't get in
But my niggas got in, my nigga
And I know what's on the map, and I be showin' my ass
As a result of the past, my nigga
And I done heard it all
But you ain't heard a foreign nigga with a southern drawl
Came up on mama cooking [?]
Got my niggas in the back plottin' how to take it all

[Chorus]
That this life ain't free, this life ain't cheap
You can live like a man, you can die on your knees (nigga choose one!)
That this life ain't free, this life ain't cheap
You can live like a man, you can die on your knees (nigga choose one!)

[Verse 3 - Well$]
Niggas been dancin' with the devil since the tenth grade
Not to piece to your template
Product of my kinfolk, got straps if you call me Kinte
Not the one for your drama, your actions say that you bitchmade
But I done learned a lot, piss poor now I'm flashy a lot
Grass city goin' hard for the squad, gotta harvest the crop
West coast with the work, but I'm silent with the moves
I don't really like talking a lot
But if you down I'll front you
Niggas livin' on front street, only doin' enough to
Look what you have succumbed to
Cuz everybody's got plans, but it ain't enough moves is what it comes to, damn
I, I got a feeling, they feeling I should stay missing more
Cuz honestly I can give you what you been fishin' for
Disengaged but I swear it only happens when I'm gettin' bored
Got they favorite rapper feelin' insecure
Exposin' what's in they dresser drawer
Cuz y'all won't practice what y'all preach (they won't)
And profit is a must, I'm touchin' everything that's in reach, nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
They said we wouldn't get in, they said we wouldn't get in
But my niggas got in, my nigga
And I know what's on the map, and we be showin' our ass
As a result of the past, my nigga
And I done heard it all
And 98 Juvie taught a nigga how to ball
Stretch 'lac on dubs when a nigga wanna crawl
Trap house a dead zone, you niggas never gettin' calls, dawg

[Chorus]
That this life ain't free, this life ain't cheap
You can live like a man, you can die on your knees (nigga choose one!)
That this life ain't free, this life ain't cheap
You can live like a man, you can die on your knees (nigga choose one!)
