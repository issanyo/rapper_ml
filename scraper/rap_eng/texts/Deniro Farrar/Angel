I use to pull kick Doe's
Run up in a nigga spot asking what it hit foe
Took a nigga roly now my mo' fucking wrist froze
Plug had them thangs coming in from San Francisco
Fed's got the phones tap can't give you no info
Now I'm laying low like a nigga doing limbo
Pull up to the trap let the jays wash the benzo
Swerve up beside the police roll down my window
Let em see the grill I got no love for the pigs tho
Every time I turn around niggas getting killed tho
Now that I'm on everybody want to come for me
Now a days I feel like loyalty a luxury
So I cautious of the people in my company
And got my eyes on the ones who say they fuck wit me
Momma told me it would be
Days like this dreamed about it
Never thought that we'd get paid like this

[Hook] X2 - Cause I dun stayed down now I finally came up
Niggas coming round acting like they made us
Used to do It free but now they gotta pay up
Just some niggas from the ghetto that got rich and famous

[Verse 2]

Used to pull kick Doe's
Run in up in a niggas spot
Asking what it hit for
Run up on the plug spent the drugs
For my kinfolk
Pull up in the driveway
You can smell the Indo
Trappin by my lonely
What the fuck I need a friend for?
Niggas say they real
But they really be pretend tho
Never catch me slippin
All my pistols got extendos
Makin fast money
So you know thas how I spend tho
Pockets on chubby
Swervin hard with lil ?Tenslo?
With some bad bitches
Eating sushi up  in Inzo
(yo yo)
And I'm prayin ??? I'd make it up out the streets
Fully loaded 45 for my enemies
Niggas hate me for no reason
Why the envy me?
Held tomb in the cell?
A G underneath
Momma told me it'd be days like this
Dreamed about it
Never thought that we'd get paid like this

[Hook] X2 - Cause I dun stayed down now I finally came up
Niggas coming round acting like they made us
Used to do It free but now they gotta pay up
Just some niggas from the ghetto that got rich and famous
