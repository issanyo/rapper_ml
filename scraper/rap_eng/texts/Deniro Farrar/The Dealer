[Chorus]
And I'm breaking down bricks
Trying to build something
Fell out with the plug and he still front me
I got shooters riding with me, they gon kill something
Blow your head off if you steal from me

And I'm breaking down pounds trying to build something
Mail man late but he's still coming
I got shooters riding with me, they gon kill for me
Blow your head off if you steal something

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Man that nigga riding with you, he ain't solid
Keep the 40 on me like a wallet
Had to leave the drop cos I know the feds watching
Pitch a nigga work like a quarterback option
Came from the gutter, going back is not an option
I'll be god damned if I let a nigga stop me
Bad bitch with me eating sushi drinking saki
Get her to the crib she gon suck me all sloppy
Niggas catching a case disturbing everybody
I got shooters on go they ready to catch a body
Jays in the kitchen, I'm cooking up like hibachi
Trapping in my forces, nigga I don't wear designer
Cameras all around us cos I don't trust a soul
How the fuck you solid nigga when you done told
Nine times out of ten it's on somebody you know
Game done changed, niggas breaking the code

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
I buy a pound, break it down, I'm trying to build something
Lay it down, play around, I'm gon kill something
I done run up from the plug and he steal from me
Had to share some love, split the drugs with my lil brother
Aye I'm a wolf but I dress up like a sheep
On a mission, I ain't slept in about a week
If you want a million dollars you can't stress about a freak
Pray to god to protect me from the devil in my sleep
Amen
My momma told me that I need to get some rest
I told her ain't no time for sleeping, I'm the best
Everybody watching, trying to peep what's coming next
Pussy niggas plotting, I'm gonna leave that pussy wet
Aye fuck a rat, run and tell that
And you can tell that pussy nigga that I said that
You folded cos you weak, nigga you can't take it back
I wrote this song for street niggas, go play it back

[Chorus]
