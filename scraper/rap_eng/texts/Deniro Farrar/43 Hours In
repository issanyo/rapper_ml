[Hook: Deniro Farrar]
43 hours in, I'm on a money binge
Wanna know where I been? I'm where the money is
Now count it out, thousand dollar piles

[Hook]

[Verse 1: ST 2 Lettaz]
See oftentimes I get lost in time
360 cents in every hour
So that means every second cost a dime
So imagine what I'm spending in a fiscal year
When bills start to pile up
And days start to disappear
So fuck a watch, I watch the sky
If the house at noon, made it back 'round sunrise
But you can't always follow the stars
So I walk by faith and try to follow my heart
My hometown on now, put it down for my home state
Young Superman still fly with no cape
And I was training in the rain all by my lonely
Now I'm winning; motherfuckers want to help me hold the trophy
So they ask why I rap about overseas
I tell them most of my Gs got cases so they can't leave
The state, or they never left the 'Ville
So I hit 'em up on Skype, show them the view from my hotel

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
(Shady Blaze, I see you
ST, what's happening, bruh?)
Out the concrete a rose grow
I'm from the block where they pill pop and guns blow
Them peewees strapped, where the fuck they finna run for?
Police patrol, we still manage to get the dope sold
That's how it go
I never been a stranger to the trap
I'm countin' up this dirty money scattered 'cross my lap
Hand on my strap, paranoid cause I'm serving smokers
Gotta watch my enemies and try to keep my friends closer
You can't tell who is who, I swear this world full of vultures
Can't trust a motherfucking soul, what the game showed us
Maneuver smooth cause them pigs tryin' to meet their quota
You get a extra five years, you lockin' with that soda
In Austin, Texas, conversatin' with my nigga Clova
He told me, "'Niro, keep on grindin' 'til you get exposure"
Christmas and Bentley with me, tryin' to get some bitches over
And Shady Blaze, my fuckin' dog, we gettin' closer
To flying private jets with ST, I'm gettin' chauffeur
But in reality I'm just a rapper trying to make it
Out my current situation with my lack of patience
Slowly embracing this rap shit as my occupation
Need a Bugatti, I'm on Twitter, DMing with Satan
Murder on my mind, I stop by the police station
Blew the cop head off that kill my nigga Aaron
I call that reparation
Bustin' like I'm crazy, pistol off safety
God, save me

[Verse 3: Shady Blaze]
I'm in the studio every day hoping for better days but I keep getting the worst, yeah
People singin' and tellin' at me but for some reason when I'm in the streets I feel cursed, yeah
I'm all on the gas and I'm tryin' to go fast but it still feels like I'm in reverse, yeah
I just wanna pile up all the money as much as I can 'til I'm up in a hearse, yeah
I got firearms gettin' held back
But the handless pain, I never felt that
Man, I go through the middle just like a tailback
And you ain't gettin' the money, I cannot help that
Nigga one time, bitch niggas want mine
But I eat like it's lunch time
Three niggas come by ridin', it's crunch time
And I threw it all, wrong man for the punchline, okay?
Let's get it, I'm ridin' here
Everybody in the area, I'm gonna have everybody in fear
All you wack male niggas, y'all about to be clear?
Get them motherfuckers droppin' 'til they box on the ear
Shady Blaze and his brethren and I got that drum
She gonna cut with your money, better stop that ho
Nigga one beat, better pop-pop and go
I'm on fire here, nigga, stop drop and roll
My homie sellin' our powder, I'm feelin' like power
The money is ours for 43 hours
(?)
It's time to devour the niggas who nah'd us, we doin' it
I just thought we'd go in it so don't be offended
Get money then spend it, we livin' resplendent
Don't tell my life business, yo, love to my niggas
And fuck all the women we movin', shit...
