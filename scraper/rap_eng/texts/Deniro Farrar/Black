[Intro]

Is it because my skin
You don't want me to win
Shit, the judge be having a nigga be hollering "master!" again
Seen the police in my rearview
My license revoked
Car clouded from the gas that I don't even smoke
I let my cousins stupid ass light his blunt in my [?]
I'm thinking about Eric Garner with their hands on his throat
Told 'em that he couldn't breathe, they continued to choke
They got your life inside they hands and they cutting it short
And they been trying to kill us all since we came on the boat
[?] But my niggas is broke
We be the main motherfuckers buying shit out they store
That's why I'm at the Goodwill shopping for me a coat
Black man at the store
Counting change for a smoke
Liquor store on every corner
They been keeping us low
It's time to liberate the people
And prepare for the war
Because we some melanin soldiers
And they don't want you to know

[Intro sample]

I'm trying to liberate my people
But they [?]
Tension in the air
You can smell the homicide
Ain't no hell ahead
The bible is a book
Had my niggas only got saved
When they got sentenced as crooks
Crack in our hood, that's all that it took
Judge look you in the eyes
And then he hit you with the book
Education on decline
Don't want to pay the teachers
But they building private prisons
And then locking up our people
You must be out your fuckin mind
To think we all equal
Lies all around us
But there's truth all in my verses
Told my granny pack a pistol
They shooting up these churches
Niggas want to take your life
When you livin' with your purpose
Keep your fucking grass cut
And watch out for the circus
The devil all around us
I can feel him when he lurking
Heart cold from the ending
I had it for your brother
Instead of trying to [?]
You taking something from him
Ain't that cold?
