[Intro]
Lord forgive me cause the way I'm livin'
They said what goes around comes around
I'm gon' get what's comin' to me
Cause I'll be strapped up till they lay me down

[Verse]
And I didn't need to much to say
I never go to church and belly pray
Lately I've been going through some thangs
Hell what the fuck I'm 'posed to say
Cause I just had two baby boys
Mama was colored and Mama's at they name
When I get caught in my emotion
Lord I swear I'm trying to make a change
I ain't wrote my brother Tune in a month
But I'm always texting with these hoes
Feel bad whenever he call my phone
He had a quarter and it ain't even show
And my lil' brother looking up to me
But I swear I ain't a role model
My uncle a fucking 'nacoholic
Can't even eat unless he got a bottle
I've been stressing about that money lately
Got me about to rob a fucking bank
And my mamma fuck with bitches now
I could judge her but I really c'ain't
Cause the way I'm ain't no betta'
I said the way I'm living ain't no betta'
I just got in beef for what's his name
So I'm riding strapped with my Beretta
