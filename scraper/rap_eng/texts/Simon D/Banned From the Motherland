[Intro]
New soul, New slaves

[Hook]
I'mma fuck around and get banned (x8)
(Banned from the motherland)

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
New soul, new hoes with a new nose
New slaves, new friends I don't do those
Too lit 'til I die in the Tulips
Truth is I ain't ever knew what a rule is
교포, never fucked with the popos
All I want is head but they beggin' for a 뽀뽀
Hongdae, with my hombres, been a long day
'Bout to be a motherfuckin' night show
My friends are deported, my girls are imported
And if I get locked up, I'm free in the morning
Reached all my limits and ignored the warnings
It's safe to say I won't get Samsung endorsements
Dropped ten bands up in 가로수 길
Your boy's dressed fresh like a funeral
I'm an OG like my 할아버지
I'm a get banned like Yoo Seung Jun
Wish a motherfucker would try to ban me
Wish a motherfucker would
아무거나 하고 싶은 거나 하지
Turn my motherland to Hollywood
Up to no good
Breakin' laws, crushin' broads, from dusk to dawn
Walk through customs like a God
King Kong got nothing on me
Fuck with a triple OG!

[Verse 2: Simon Dominic]
Oh my god 처음 [?]
걱정마 childish shit [?]
첫번째 서랍에서 콘돔 [?]
[?]
확실히 해 나 애기 좋아해 but not yet
My life's so childish
Trophy 받아가 [?]
근데 내일부터 [?] 아 시발 안해 ㅋㅋㅋ
[?]

[Hook]
Imma fuck around and get banned (x8)
(Banned from the motherland)

[Verse 3: Jay Park]
I'ma fuck around town and get banned again
Yeah I fuck around you, you and a friend
[?]
Get a couple million views oh, high demand
Is what I'm in, what I'm in Seoul city wildin'
Acting childish, cause I'm [?]
Clubs stand back, I get violent
Cause I get a lot of them [?]
One shot a tsunami, and steal a Bugatti, I got everybody
[?] my homie Korean Zombie
I'm finna get bodied and take your bitch
And go get some sloppy, no room at the hotel
But I'm throwin' up in the lobby
I'm blacked out, blacked out blacked out
Banned from the motherland﻿ even at my pops house
So many Dongdaemun knockoffs
AOMG be poppin' everybody tryna' hop on

[Verse 4: G2]
