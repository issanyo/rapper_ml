[Bridge: Dumbfoundead]
I'm a hyung, since i was young
Get your bread up i ain't playin'
With you crumbs
Ima stunt, cause i'm a hyung
I'm your hyung’s, hyung’s, hyung’s
Hyung’s, hyung’s, hyung, hold up

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
I’m on my hyung shit, i’m on my hyung shit

Hyung’s, hyung’s, hyung, HYUNG SHIT!

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
I’ve been a hyung, they use two hands
When pourin’ me rum, pour up
Walk in the room, make it all quiet
They holding’ their tongues, hold up
Show me respect, i’ll show it back
Thats the code of conduct
I could give a fuck if your bitch ass older
Your bitch call me oppa
Mi vida loca
No matter the age go out and rage
Zach de la rocha

You’ll forever be a bum
Never be a hyung, yeee

[Verse 3: Simon Dominic]
아무도 나를 지금 나이로 안 봐
비결은 babyface
알거든 나도 pretty motherfucker
외모빨 좀 먹혔지 데뷔 땐
언더 시절엔 skill, skill, skill
하나로 인기는 levitation
형 대접 받길 원하던 놈들은
그 때도 지금도 내 밑에
심지어 아저씨라고 불려도
내 수식어는 fuckable
I be on other shit
내 삶을 원하면 그 꿈은 꺾어줘
덤파는 두 살 동생
얼굴은 나보다 형 but k-town OG
한국에서 놀자 새꺄
난 언제든 준비 돼있단 거지 (알았나?)

[Bridge: Dumbfoundead]
I’m a hyung, since i was young

But fuck all that hyung shit
Fuck all that hyung shit
I’m your hyung’s, hyung’s, hyung’s
Hyung’s, hyung’s, hyung, HYUNG SHIT!
