Pop that Green bottles
Pop that bottles like Sojupapi Jarv Dee we brothers
It’s Jay hyung’s treat, it’s Jay hyung’s treat again
Jay hyung makes me live a life that makes 1 year’s worth of money for you in just one month for me
If you’re saying it’s cuz I have a good agency, fuck you
That’s not that I learned, it’s just having a heart that’s not arrogant
And the word humility, that’s it
But see how I’m growing and growing
Whatever, just pour me another shot, mind your own business
One more drink, drink up
Need to escape a life that’s too intoxicated
So I bout to get lit off the soju
No alcoholic I’m just workaholic
So I bout to get lit off the soju

Hey friend, I’m sure you have your own fucked up problems
I have my own fucked up problems too so don’t shit on me
Of course sometimes when I drank soju
I talked a lot of shit about others too
But once I got hurt from that, I don’t do that anymore
You never saw my life from next to me, wanna come to Amshil?
This is a special soju that I got from New York but I’ll open it
I’ll tell you straight up, after last summer, it was my DARKROOM season
I partied too right up until I was about to explode
Sometimes, I got drunk and starting breaking things
I partied with girls, got mixed up in a complete fuck it mode
Gotta live a life of squander in order to fall asleep
Flirting with girls I’ve never seen before
Breaking all the promises, I can’t be perfect
Just cuz I make money and live a big life doesn’t mean I’m happy
Haven’t you seen rich people or #1 people suddenly die?
If you’re jealous, you live that way too if not, take my place
I’ve never taken a break, worrying endlessly is part of my job
