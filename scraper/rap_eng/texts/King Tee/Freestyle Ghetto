[Intro: Xzibit]
Ay, what the fuck man? (*laughter*)
See, look, look, uhh

[Verse One: Xzibit]
I grab the mic and start breakin down niggas without no problems
Broadcastin live from the bottom
Ain't no mic checkin worse, kick some rhymes if you got them
But if it's whack, I draw back the cap for the peelin
Shoulda stuck to rock dealin
Cause it's the blood stealin, super villain
Chillin, stayin high like the ceilin
See there ain't enough room for the both of us
See it's a showdown, throw down, your best style I'll bust (yo)
I write rhymes that make niggas throw they sets up
Couldn't hold my style if you had a pair of handcuffs
In all disrespect
I'll snatch you by your neck and do a suplex and step
So nigga you can check my credentials
Just hard rhymes and instrumentals
Xzibit smash you wit a dental and a loaded pistol
No longer lookin in the window
I'll bust a field wit indo
Killin quarts of beer, Sadie's outta here...

[Verse Two: MC Breeze]
Like a fuse, start spreadin the news
It's ninety-four and Breeze is givin niggas the blues
I paid my dues, and now it's time to go on to the next mode
Make room for the kaboom, cause I'm about to explode
And drop bombs like a B1, cops I seize none
And niggas step up, I soak emcees son
Three seconds to detonate, you betta evacuate
No time to hesitate, you fuckin featherweight
I ain't the type to pick up the mic and catch the stage fright
I'll pull a gauge if I ain't paid right
To the promoters on tour
Short me a buck and a buckshot and the barrel is yours!
I'm psychopathic like Manson, ain't wit the dancin
But still I get more Cheers than Ted Danson
More dough than Marino or roles than Pacino
You beatin me? Yhat's only in your dreams ho
I'm not sayin I'm unbeatable, I'm sayin I'm untouchable
Livin comfortable just like a Huxtable
Plus I'm rollin with the crossroads
Move in fast foward, while you other suckers stuck in a pause mode
I goes deep like a great white, but I'mma stay black
No matter how high the pay stacks, or if my rep gets bigger
You might get take this nigga out the ghetto, but not the ghetto out this nigga

[Verse Three: J-Ro, Tash]
For the balls, basketballs, microphones gas and grass (hey)
Some of the few things J-Ro likes to pass
93 mandingo, 94 I'm the pharaoh
Cause I'm b-b-bad to the bone marrow
I get wild, with more styles than the martial arts
I need weed, I roll more grass than golf carts
April ninety-two you know the Ro was a looter
Now I'm writin raps on my laptop computer
J-Ro the tittie fiend, rap dean, wearin green
Been on the scene, since the age of thirteen
I learned I had to earn the mic, now's my turn
I got Furious Styles like Larry Fishburne

With the bitches tunin me in like it's the Young and the Restless
Next up to bust my shit from the L-I-K-S's
Yes it's the freshest with lyrics rough around the edges
I'll smoke you on the mic like a pack of Benson Hedges
But.. hold up wait, I'll bust rhymes that'll circulate
That'll "Wake yo' punk ass up" like MC Eiht
Cause I been rockin rhymes since the roof was on fire
So point me to the bitch who's the dopest butterfly'er
I'll make her break it down like she Patra when I catch ya
Broadway is on the tables while I throw these lyrica at'cha
So.. slow down before ya fuck wit my sound
You better do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around

[Verse Four: King Tee]
Now me watch get Doggy like Snoop, funky from my group
Make them wanna shoot, there it is whoop
Fool, I got props, bustin at the cops
Gettin what I got, blowin up the spots
Checkin out the scene, somethin like a dream
How I become a king, stuffin all the green
Coolest of the cool, a God damn fool
Breakin up the rule, I'm from the old school
So hey, busters speak, no wait busters preach
Signed by the each, trickin for the treat
Known to be the boss, tipsy off the sauce
Drunk off the funk cause Tha Alkaholiks floss
The real situation, so peep what you facin
The Zulu Nation on your Nubian station
Ready for the war, walk without a girl
I'm livin cherry mood with the diamonds and pearls...

You know what I'm sayin
Some of that old black shit, you know what I'm sayin
Comin from the West coast side, you know what I'm sayin
That crazy shit
Back off with that all other bullshit, what's up Jermaine
My man Breeze is in the motherfuckin house tonight you know what I'm sayin
My man Xzibit, yeah, Tha Alkaholik straight pumpin shit straight at you
From the signifyin Crew you know what I'm sayin
Day-alight, yeah, yeah, yeah
Check it out y'all? comin down tonight, broad way
Jamboree, this shit is straight pumpin, word up
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me
Let me do a motherfuckin back up
