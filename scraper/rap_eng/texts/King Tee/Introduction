[King Tee]
As we journey into another King Tee's album
You know what I'm saying?
Coming out on Capitol Records
Yeah, I know, you suckers thought I wouldn't be coming back
You thought I drink too much
But see, when I drink, I get hyper than the motherfucker
HA HA HA HA HAAH, YEEEEAAAAHHHHHH, you know what I'm saying?
I wanna thank my homeboy Bul-al
For coming down forward to cut some beats for me
I wanna thank my DJ E-Swift
My homeboy Young Flord and J-Ro and MC Breeze
And DJ Smoove, you know what I'm saying?
YEEEEAAAAHHHHHH, FOOL!!
