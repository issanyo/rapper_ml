Nigga quit playin with the god damn drum machine
Motherfucker (ha) yo..

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Wherever my crew go, same old scenario
Takin over every show, rockin on the radio-ohhhhhhhh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[E-Swift]
It's Tha Liks you know our repoitoire, we party y'all
We treat every day like it's fuckin Mardi Gras (y'know)
Y'all done started somethin you just can't finish
Ten years deep in this game called rap business
We takin hip-hop back, it's gettin unbearable
Y'all done disrespected the game somethin terrible
My Likwid Crew shower you, with rhymes that's uncomparable
Beats so ridiculous it just ain't fair to you
We act stupid off the tonic and whiskey
Smoke so much weed you might think I'm a hippie
In the club drunk with my nigga King Tipsy
Lookin for some hoes that we can toss like frisbies
Bail through the club belligerent like, "Bitch Please" (damn)
Tab at the bar is already like six G's
Everywhere we go, I roll with the same old gang
Doin the same old thang, again and again

Niggas know.. (y'all niggas know)..
On your marks get wet, three vets is on the set
It's nine years in the game and we ain't lost a step yet
We still in full effect with drunk rhymes that make the world spin
(While you starin at me nigga) Nigga, I'm starin at your girlfriend
Women see us out and think my click is too obnoxious
Cause we bail around the party like we off a couple notches
We off a couple vodkas, homegirl, we Likwid niggas
Take the time to get to blow us, tell yo' friends come kick it with us
Ha ha, all jokes aside, we slide slippers
Money fallin out my pocket like I robbed nine strippers
Tash is, "Animal House" like Jon Belushi
I'll be drinkin all the sake while you eatin all the sushi (damn)
(Whattup nigga?) It's still the same situation
Tha Liks be gettin head from the same bitch you datin
Ratin us a 9'll be a waste of your time
We tens with big ends so let the games begin (y'know)

[Hook]

[Tash]
Niggas know.. y'all niggas know..
Niggas know.. y'all niggas know..

[King Tee]
Yeah, yeah!
Imperialistic without doubt, the King'll blast your character out
So stop playin with it, you fadin in it
I stay with it, let me present the crown sound
Constricted with the Likwid, the ticket round town
The wicked wild sound unleashed out the cage
Plus the Alkaholiks got the bar on stage
Get pissy, Tipsy got a baggy full of cavi
J-Ro put D's on the Mavi'
Swift got TV's in the Caddy
Tash kept it all factory
The Likwid far from tacky
Even if I step in the Sky Bar, K-Swiss and hard khakis
Y'all niggas better be happy, let me bubble

[Hook]

[Tash]
Niggas know.. niggas know, y'all niggas know..
Niggas know.. y'all niggas know..

Wherever my crew go, same old scenario..
