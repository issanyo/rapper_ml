[King Tee]
Now step up, to the King Tee's beer stand
And let me know what beer is grand
No, no, wait, I got somebody that might convince ya
Hold up, hold up, wait

[Ice Cube]
Once again it's on, I'm going out the front door
Ice Cube in the glass house, headed for the store
To get a beer that's better than the rest
The S-T-Period-I-D-E-to-the-S
And it'll put hair on your chest
In the black can, so won'tcha grab a six pack and
Get your girl in the mood quicker
Get your jimmy thicker, with St. Ide's Malt Liquor

[King Tee]
Hold up, hold up
So when you get a forty, roll to the spot
Hug and kiss your girl and screw the cap off the top
And get a taste of the beer that makes you tingle
And just remember that jingle

[Singers]
Here's something that's sweeping the nation by surprise
It's that fabulous malt liquor they call St. Ide's
