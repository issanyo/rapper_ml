[Spoken: Rodney O]
This Rod 0 in stereo, that ol school fool
From Philadelphia PA
That's a hook you can cook, bitch
A.B. Aboriginal
Always all that
Always black

[Intro: Briggs, King T & Trials]
It's a cool Saturday night
Drive around leanin' on the passenger side
Ya not feelin' these sounds you can get the fuck out
Sorry, I'm nice but I'm never polite

[Verse 1: Briggs]
Roll with 2 T's like I'm Malcolm Little
Don't know what your dad does: Malcolm in the Middle
I made a phone call to Scuba Steve
And he let me know he gonna hook up whatever Trigga needs
King T, couldn't get a bigger G
Swiggin Alkaholik and Trigga got a bigger tree
If they ain't high you could'a fooled me
Stogie on the dash and the purp on the front seat
That's the shotgun, 'fraid not son
And you can't sit there if you ain't got one
If you want some get some if ya bad enough take some
Oh no? Then get the fuck out the way cuz

[Chorus: Briggs, King T & Trials]
You know, we eating, you know, we eating
You know, we eating, we feasting!
You know, we eating, you know, we eating
You know, we eating, we feasting!
We stay eating, you stay starving
You stay mad while we stay laughing
HA HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA HA HA

[Pre-Verse Ad-Libs: King T]
My nigga Trials (yeah) Briggs (yeah)
What's happening? A.B.ORIGINAL
It's the Likwit, check it

[Verse 2: King T]
It's another west coast swig and I'm pulling up with Briggs
With no more fucks to give, I'm a hub city nightmare right there Standing with the Likwit
Locked in with A.B.ORIGINAL, they the business
I'm so solid I eliminate frolics
Call it what you call it, it's the gangsta Alkaholik
TRUST That ol green, KUSH no seeds
A different type of cloth I'm cut, that ol' creed
Man these ho's ain't knowing I'm a show 'em
King still trifling, Likwit still flowing
Blowing on nothing but the best, fuck stress
Show ya how to rock it from Australia to the west
Turn down for what? A nigga'll sleep
When he rest in peace In other words deceased
Till that part I'ma just beast
And kick back with Trials and Briggs and just feast

[Chorus: Briggs, King T & Trials]
You know, we eating, you know, we eating
You know, we eating, we feasting!
You know, we eating, you know, we eating
You know, we eating, we feasting!
We stay eating, you stay starving
You stay mad while we stay laughing
HA HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA HA HA

[Verse 3: Trials]
Well it's a hot, hot Sunday, blowing hydro in the breeze
Never wore a watch cos I got nowhere to be
With a scuba tank, hooked it up directly to the hoobastank
Hooked up by Scuba Steve rolling with that super dank
Dabbled in the dab, so fucken sticky
Couldn't pack it in a bag (let that bitch breath)
Then I'm in it till its finished, snap like a mousetrap
If I don't get it then I'm bench-pressing house cats
(A.B.ORIGINAL) Handle the difference
The illest black villain since Lando Calrissian
And hand over fist I break bricks with my paws
Roll the weed at warp speed while I listen to the sword
Keep bouncing magician with the marijuana
Dropped the bomb in megaton dutching out my power armour
With my squad large, leaping over cop cars
Inside a hydroponic shop to put a pot plant inside a pot plant
And feast

[Outro: Briggs, King T & Trials]
When we connect you know we eat
Daz, Trials, Briggs, King T
Fix a plate and take your seat
Grab a drink and join the feast
When we connect you know we eat
Daz, Trials, Briggs, King T
Fix a plate and take your seat
Grab a drink and join the feast
HA HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA HA HA
