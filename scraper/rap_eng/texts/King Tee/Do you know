Im who they wanna be
My voice kinda messed up right now
An do you knooowho
Do you know how it feel when you gotta write rhymes just so you can make it big
Do you know the difference from when ya broke and when you be rich
I promise my soul that I ain't gone drop outta school like you rappers did
Im gone do it the right way cause that’s how I always had wished
4x That’s how I wanna live But do you know Do you know

Do you know when you gotta walk home specially when you home alone
But Im strong enough cause my fear not gone make nothing go wrong
Im a young rapper from the nati
Most of these people don’t look happy
You can call a hood the trenches
But it’s really not a difference
People lose they life in just minutes
Im on ten toes I ain't slippin
I believe that Im the realist
Im tryna stack racks to the ceiling
I told momma what I wannna be
I wanna rap to these people
Im spittin bars it’s illegal
Yah think I am invisible
My life is really not fictional
Whole lotta things done got physical
All of the wanna be’s miserable
But do you know that Im a miracle

Do you know how it feel when you gotta write rhymes just so you can make it big
Do you know the difference from when you broke and when you be rich
I promise my soul that I ain't gone drop outta school like you rappers did
Im gone do it the right way cause that’s how I always had wished
4x That’s how I wanna live But do you know Do you know

Im dodging haters like the matrics
In life Im gone have to have patience
One day Im gone really make it
I swer the god my heart be racing
Me and moms use to go through it
But we winning now not losing
My five brothers juggin and movin
This year Im gone be improving
You dont really know bout the struggle
You dont really know how to hustleYou ain't bout flexin them muscles
Do you know when ya mind be puzzled
I used to rap in front my dad friends
I really thought that I was the man
Back then I called them my fans
They would listen and understand
But do you know…… Bout wearing the same clothes
Do you know….. Bout cooking food on the stove
Do you know ….. when you had to sweep that floor
Do you know….. When the girls come and you fold

Do you know how it feel when you gotta write rhymes just so you can make it big
Do you know the difference from when you broke and when you be rich
I promise my soul that I ain't gone drop outta school like you rappers did
Im gone do it the right way cause that’s how I always had wished
4x That’s how I wanna live But do you know Do you know
