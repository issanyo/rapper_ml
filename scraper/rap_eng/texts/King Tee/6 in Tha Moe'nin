Six in the mornin', awakened by a knock on my door
Grabbed my fo-fo' before I put my feet on the floor
And yelled "Who is it?", peeped through my blind just a smidget
My nigga Bone stood in some cold black lizards
(What's up!?) Nigga how ya been, what ya doin'?
(Ah, some niggas havin' problems with my money so I flew in
You know this kid Juan, got a sista named Chatan?
Live up in the Palms sellin' chronic by the tons)
As ya mention, he got that woodgrain Expedition
60's tried to kill him but they missed him
They said that nigga got a big mouth, boastin' bout some hustlers
That he hit from Down South, what's that all about?
(That nigga's crazy, show me where he hang, it's all gravy
Put on some clothes, I'm double parked in my Rolls and niggas hate me)
I feel ya baby, let me grab this linen
And slip on these sandals with the ostrich all in 'em
(Man call them stripper hoes, tell 'em call all they people
I hear that nigga hidin' out, trickin' at the Nikko)
Don't worry 'bout a thing (Yeah I need to calm down)
Well let me grab some mary jane, get higher than a plane
(Do you still got that Glock that I gave you on the block?
Some funk was 'bout to pop then you ran up in that spot)
Ah shit, I forgot all about that heat Bone
I got the stash spot in my Brougham (Well nigga it's on)

"Who the fuck" - "Who the fuck is this?"
"Big black motherfucker with G's"
(It's King Tee)
"Who the fuck" - "Who the fuck is this?"
"Big black motherfucker with G's
(It's King Tee)

Lookin' shady, doin' 80 (babay!) Don't temp me
The weed smoke floatin' like the Bentley
Lay back on a gangsta mack strictly
(Man just wait 'til I catch that young fool that tried to get me
They says he probably rollin' around like he ownin' the town
Not knowin' I'm down, not knowin' I clown) *phone rings*
Well loc, them stripper hoes just hit me
That nigga at the Century Club playin' Big Willie
Dancin' with the Cristal, the ho had the nerve
To say a nigga missin' out (What?! Who the fuck is that?)
(Tell them stripper hoes to pop that twat and keep 'em hot)
And when he come out (Loc, that nigga gettin') *gun shot*

[Hook #2]
Ooh, his first mistake was
He had to do the crime
He had to hustle mornin' to the night
If, he would have known then
The things that he knows now
He might not have got that time in Wayside
