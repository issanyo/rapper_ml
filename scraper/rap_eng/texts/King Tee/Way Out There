[King Tee]
All aboard the mothership, prepare to set sail
Lyrics fat, swell as a killer whale
Enemies approachin, identify yourself
They're raisin up the flag, backin up they get to blast
Open fire, cannons let loose
Shut 'em down like the spruce goose
Captain aye aye, they still floatin
Give the order - blow they punk ass out the ocean, got 'em
Drink hit the dank as they sink to the bottom
Schools of sharks circles then the sea turned all purple
Even Jacques Costeau punk-ass was scared to go
And that just goes to show to uhh, let you know, uhh
As I chill again like Gilligan and the Skipper
A nigga kickin it with two hoes like Jack Tripper
Swabbin the deck, just stabbin in my cabin
Rubbed the magic lamp and out popped Aladdin like "What's happenin?"
I said, "What's up? I want my rhymes to be the dopest
Ala.. cadabara.. hocus pocus
You think they can see me?" He said, "Nope not really
Cause the fog's in the air plus you're way out there"

[Hook]
When you look up in the sky, ohh me oh my
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a god damn shame
Tela come wicked and you best beware
You will see when he kick it that he's way out there

[King Tee]
My style pattern's unique, exquisite, so come visit
Exhibit A through G, through Z, E-N-T
Stuck your equilibrium on activate
Captivate the ear and then his eyesockets upon my pockets
I left him in suspense, who's the, tribes and crews?
Competition none exists bitches be blowin me kisses
Others fall like missiles, the cap was artificially flavored
My first verse, it quenched your thirst
For instance, I'm makin people boogie but yet
From long distance, causin it to interfere with your hemisphere
Flee, it's a G recipe
It get you hooked, havin fits off my shit

[Hook]

[King Tee]
They wanna wipe us out! I think they hate us
Killers with the pencils and the papers and erasers
I'm comin through ya living room boom, shok-a-lok-a boom
Shake ya whole area, break your sound barrier
So wake up if you sleep cause like a clock I tock I'm tickin
Early bird, get the worm, and I stopped slangin chickens
But I still be kickin facts, black, black on black crime
Why the hell you jackin me? I don't have a damn dime
My skills kill you like a deer with my spear
When it rains it pours he fell from the tier off the third floor
The pieces of the puzzle huh, figure it out
And start fuckin around and we'll be diggin you out
And it's just that simple put the thang up to your temple
And now you got a permanent dimple
It's King, Tee, the name nigga and don't get snotty
Better knock on some doors and ask somebody (yeah)
So fuck that other shit and grab my hand with all your might
Cause I'mma show you what that West coast like
The flavor's unbelievable, nutritious, delicious
Nigga when the Tee get loose it gets vicious
