Yo Pooh, man
What you build in there, man?
(Ah - one of those hypso-change-o-calypso-beat-a-matics)

Another package from your slick Royal Highness
Pay attention, so you won't have to rewind this
Put yourself together for another funky clip
I bring a lotta magic, but this ain't no trick
It's pure skill I possess in my possession
A crazy rhythm and my funky horn section
And Pooh hyped up this funky ol' track
So I thought about it, I'm comin (I'm back)

(When I'm done)
(I'm back)
(When I'm done)
(King Tee is back again)

Now let me talk to ya to the best of my ability
About the kid that's rockin this facility
I bring to you peace and tranquility
Don't try to front, cause I know you feel it, see
My beats are masculine, I think that there hasn't been
A better groove to keep you like dancing, man
I feel thankful to feel there ain't no
Sucker tryin to gank my spot, least I think so
But I don't sweat, cause I can stand on my two feet
Hold the mic and just curse the beat
I don't complain about the crowd I attract
Roll out the red carpet, I'm comin (I'm back)

(When I'm done)
(There'll be another ruff rhyme)
(King Tee is back again)
(There'll be another ruff rhyme)
(When I'm done)
(I'm back)
(King Tee is back again)

Well, this might seem odd
You ask who taught me, well, it musta been God
Cause ain't none of y'all cool like me
The impressario, majestic Tee
Some rappers are scared of me, they say when they dare to be
Threatened, well, keep on steppin, I'll be prepared to be
Jacked, Jack, cause your rhymes don't match
You got bold when I left, now I'm back
To stomp you, cause you stomp wrong, so I'mma stomp on
Fool, you forgot, I'm from Compton
This is just a taste of my album, really nothin
Just to show you I'm back (I'm comin)

(Back again) (back again) (back again)
(There'll be another ruff rhyme)
(There'll be another ruff rhyme
(When I'm done)
(There'll be another ruff rhyme)
(Ruff rhyme)
(Ruff rhyme)
(Ruff rhyme)
