And that's how we do
Smokin em muthafuckas

No justice, no peace then, Mr. Policeman
Save a life for your kids and your wife
No more donuts and coffee
And I'll be back once I get off these concrete streets
Infrared scope and I'm mad as fuck
I'm on the roof tryin to duck from the pigs, cause they suck
Pick em all one by one, cause they all got a strap
Tryin to beat us with the stick and the gat
Lookin at the news and now I see pals
Carlton, Koons, Hearns comin up sooner than he thought
It might be at a stop light or maybe at the station
Either way it go, I'm stilll makin bacon
Stuff him with a apple in his mouth, make sure he's gaffled
Tie his ass up and bring him back to my castle
Throw him in the dungeon, leave his badge and his gun
In the car, turn it upside down, burn it up
And let it blaze, all I got left is one guage
I slung all the ones that I brung from the gun
Store, I gotta get at least three more
And I could give a fuck what you think I got em for

And all the King's hoes and all the King's men
Go try to put this shit black together again
Come on

12 whites on a black, what's next?
Pull a man out his truck and get stretched
I got a grudge with the judge
Cause he don't show no love for chocolate fudge
He only likes vanilla
But we do all the work like Cinderella?
And I'll be damned if I get paid at a minimum wage
While they afford to eat like a smorgasbrod feast
And leave us here down in the dumps
The place where Donald Trump would get his ass jumped
Slavin at Mickey D's for 4 bucks and a quarter
And can't afford a Big Mac with a soda
The biggest crooks, the biggest thugs there ever was
Was the ones that they vote for and hope for
Quicker than a zig-zag, they got big bags
Fill em to the ceilin, now who's doin the killin?
Then they point the finger at the young male black
Workin two jobs, so he gotta sell crack
So all the King's hoes and all the King's men
Go try to put this shit black together again
Come on

Let's do it like the wild wild west
Take off your holster and your gat and let's scrap
But Porkey the Pig don't wanna get em up
Unless you got your hands in some cuffs
Will I break the law if I break your jaw?
Turn around take two steps and draw
And make sure your plastic kill
Cause I came to get busy for real
So when you jump in my fo'
Make sure you slam the do'
And no bullshit on my flo'
Cause all the King's hoes and all the King's men
Help put this shit black together again
And I'm Audi
