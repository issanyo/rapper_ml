Intro: Twigg

Who can stop me now?
You wanna be my nigga now?
You wanna be my bitch now?
I don't think so

Hook: King T

See me in the club with your chick and say what'up
Killin' lines everywhere we go, we run this town
Im screamin' who can stop me now
Mmmh im screamin' who can stop me now
Yeah now i got your girl twerking all night 'til she pass out
Money on my mind...........by this hustle
Im screamin' who can stop me now
Yeah! Im screamin' who can stop me now, now!

Verse 1: Twigg

I was struggling everyday
Now im hustling everyday
Nigga i want respect and punani - fuck fame
You cannot stop me now so watch me
The trigga pulled you can't stop me
I killed the nigga and im sorry
Rap ma business and i own it
I don't need weed to get higher, man
Go get the pussy or call the fireman
I break your girl then break your heart
You ain't paper but i'll tear you apart
Im your worst nightmare - sweetdreams
Im so true to be kidding
Im sitting out and im sitting in
Im shitting out and im shitting in

Hook: King T

Verse 2: Twigg

Ok im going in, im so ill
No criminal but i like to kill
Fuck fake coz im so real
Your flow old mine coming out
Im cuming on that bitch i ain't cuming out

Who can stop us now, nigga
No pain no gain, nigga
My balls bigger than your brain, nigga
She be twerking all night, nigga
I pray to God almighty, nigga

You can't leave without money(your lifeless)
Ima king and high call me your HIGHNESS!!!
