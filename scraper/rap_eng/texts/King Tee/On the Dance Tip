Now dancers, here's another hit for your collection
Take a deep breath, let's start sketchin
Moves for the dancers to get into
I'mma wait on you, now here's your menu
Just order what you want cause you know
I can rock a slow or a swing tempo
So swing to it, it ain't nothin but a good feelin
And if you're willin I'mma tell you the deal then

I got to see you move it (on the dancefloor, baby)

Yo, that's how we doin it in 1990, youknowmsayin?

Now all you gotta do is get loose
Yeah, show you got juice
If punks wanna jump, run em up and I shoot
Slick, slick poetry for those who got couth
And if you'll dance even if you can't dance
Enhance a rhythm that'll glance
Up against your body as the music just swings
Knockin out the suckers now who's left? (Kiiiing)

(Let's have some fun y'all)

Now keep on movin, better yet keep steppin
You know, from the right to the left and
Dance all night till your knee caps break
You can do the Biz Markie, then the Heavy D Shake
If you like to boogie from sun to the moon
Well, cut the rug to my rhythm & blues tune
Just remember if the phonograph skips
Don't worry about a thing, we're on a dancin tip

And I got to see you move it (on the dancefloor, baby)
Yeah yeah
Come on come on come

We got to see you move it (on the dancefloor, baby)
