(Intro: Phil The Agony)
Yeah, y'all
Phil The Agony
Who else could it be, man
You know its me and King Tee coming through, Likwit Crew
Official for you, so just Back Up
Saying, its all legitimate lyrics
Yeah, yeah, check it out
Yo, yo

(Verse 1: Phil The Agony)
Repercussion, young girls blushing
Keep flushing, tears strong enough to get with your peers
It took, years to game, maintain
Walk through the rain, simple and plain
The bank will get to your brain
If it ain't these punk ass niggas, its these begging ass bitches
Tryna get, one up on my riches
I wouldn't fuck with you if I didn't think that you was hot
But why you wanna grab your Glocks and tryna run up in my spot
I got, sensors for your skin's, lasers beams, cameras at the wall
Infrared beams, fuck up the whole dream team
Big Phil The Agony, your little homie from back in the day
Way back in the day, like King Tee and K. Day
Chris Shaw, MLK
Blaze on the Escalades and CLKs, you see L.A
Today up, today, I'm still Agony
You still King Tee, The Great
Loud and clear like off the X tape, Verne
And (?), we came through brand new
Spent, with XO and Big Dank
D-igga Pooh, Barbershop brothers
We don't love them hoes, they love us
They suck us off till be bust one off
I came back 2001, like I just begun
Oh, what a feeling, its so fun
PTA all day with no sleep
Up with King Tee, produced by Dre all week

(Bridge: Phil The Agony and King Tee)
Yeah
Oh-way
Back up
Lot of game
*incoherent* Laughs

(Verse 2: King Tee)
No question
From here on in no processions
Alcohol confession filled the agony aggressing
Up to come soon, the kingdom of doom
In your era, styles of terror, frunk bearer
We need the misfits through your whole district
The rugged six shits stirred into liquid
With the bomb, thugs call me Cool Placant
I'm a don, that's G shit, please believe it
The Emperelli, Sasquatch Donnatelli
The dice got me acting sweaty on the daily up in Vegas
Whachu punks think, watchu hoes drink
We at the ball fucked up in Khakis and minks, and
Don't really give a fuck what you hoes think
I know my breath stink bitch, ('What?')
Back up
They just announced my brother is sweppers on the cut
But the masters of the ceremony, sound phoney
Let me step up, represent with the homie
Snatch your mic, peace
The night priest, to drive peace
To captivate the crowd, that's the least
We activate the sound for the streets
And mash out, massive
Pulling on the toke between classes
Honey ask us 'Where the fuck J in Cashes'
Bitch, what I look like, the niggas stay blastin'
Catch the next flow, XO

(Outro: Phil The Agony)
Yeah, yeah, y'all
Phil The Agony, 2001
King Tee, niggas with Crew
Looking till we see
Keep rocking with it
Keep rocking with it
Keep rocking with it
Yeah y'all, Los Angeles at its best
Likwit Crew, yeah we out
