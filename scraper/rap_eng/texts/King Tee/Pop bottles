We be pop bottles
Drinking until we faded
Seen my bitch about last week (yeah)
Pop pills, they is no way I'm
Sober (Yeah) trippin got me injured

(verse)
Yeah... I see you hope I get a chance
With pills they is no way I'm going home
Seen like mom about 4 weeks ago
Hope I got safe, all this pills and weed
Got high, see my niggas on dope shit
I hope to meet my travis
Nigga bout me Stargazing (Yeah)
The night was lit, so I had to still
Like a other week

(chorus)
We pop bottles
Drinking until we faded
Seen my bitch about last week
Pop pills, they is no way I'm sober
Trippin got me injured
