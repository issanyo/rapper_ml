Hey, I knew this nigga named Johnnie Walker
A nightstalker, a big shit-talker
Even though he liked a lot of vodka
He was from Tennessee, sprung off Hennessy
Makin' enemies fast
In L.A. and they didn't play
He got into a tangle with Ray, he had on too much gray
Ray had a Strawberry sister named Daiquiri
Johnnie politely walked her ass behind the factory
Now, all four uncles E&J wanna talk, see
Martini and Rossi had to get the niggas off me
He got Jacked for his Daynas, in other words
He caught the Nighttrain and blasted a Thunderbird
With the pistol, him and Cisco, couldn't stand him
'Cause he caught him lickin' Brandy off his sister named Kandi
At this point he had more bad luck than a trash truck
He lost his girl, Remy spent his last buck up
Remy caught him shootin' game at Elayne, so now
Flowers and champagne don't mean a damn thang
Remy ended up runnin' off with Martin
He was wanted for arson for startin' fires in Carson
So Johnnie hired a gun named Rum, and paid him
151 and the job got done
With a .38 straight to the face
He caught him in a six-pack and got they ass back
Up close he made 'em post and broke all their glasses
Spilled him and Rum threatened their families with matches
He felt he needed more men just like Gin
So he packed his strap and started claimin' Silver Satin
From then on in, anybody caught bailin'
Down Seagram's 7 was bound to get sweated
Except Bartles and Jaymes, cause they was cool
He knew 'em from school when they didn't bang and made moves
Turns out, he never reached the top
They found his ass at the beach on the rocks
