(So I went into the record store
And I saw this album sittin there
I saw this sharp lookin dude on the cover and I said:)

It's another production from the King Tee crew
You know, E-Swift and the DJ Pooh
We brung a little somethin that we thought you might get hip to
Take a trip to a beat that gets you
Up and just swingin doin your thing and
Bangin on the walls while the King Tee's singin
Funky old lyrics that I made when I was drunk
So I can care less about a MC chump
Tryin to diss me with some rhymes that suck
Sissy rhymes you must've bought for a buck
I usually don't squeal but your rappin is weak
Bust some rhymes, I even let you rap on my beat
(Trashin MC's) yeah, that's the must and
(Doggin all punks) no need for discussion
(But what about that Cadilla you had?) it's plushed and
You better get ready, it's the King Tee Produciton

(I mean I have seen many, many productions in my life..)
(Oh yeah?)
(..but this production pulled off here by)

King Tee, a super cool male
It felt kinda good to see "Act a Fool" sell
But hey, I'm back again with another new topic
I mean it's 90, a nigga's gotta rock it
And my intentions is to keep you steppin
No suckers allowed cause I ain't lettin
Ya mess up the party with your wacky-wack rappin
The crowd starts booin soon as you start flappin
Your mouth, Ralph, so go ahead, break south
I knew you was a chump when you walked in the house
You tried to bust a move but your rhymes don't function
Because of the King Tee Production

(Alright y'all
I want y'all to put your hands together
And to bring on a brother that's bound to lay more dips in your hips)

(Now I think everyone in the production should make their talents known
To everyone out there)
(Let's hear it, boy)

DJ P-double o-h
Beats so funky that you cover your face
DJ E-Swift on the cut
Got quarters on the head so the needle won't jump
K-i-n-g T-double e, period
I yell a lot (TO MAKE THAT YOU'RE HEARIN IT!)
Just like old times when I walk across stage
With the forty in my hand cause that was soft of a trade-
Mark, cool lyrics I'm bustin
You say a few lines and you're huffin and puffin
Me, I just flow, no need to be rushin
Peace from the King Tee Production
