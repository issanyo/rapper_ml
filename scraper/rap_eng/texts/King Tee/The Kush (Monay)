[Verse 1 - King T]
I never wanted to work for motherfuckers that me what to do
So I did my own thing
Sometimes shit got thick, but I made it through
Now I'm stacking chips every time the phone rings
I'm the world of liars and connivers
Caught between fires, dope dealing survivors
But I must maintain, think on a level much higher
This shit ain't worth a 25 to lifer
People always ask me how I made it in this trade
Paparazzi got my biz front page
But all I gotta say is it's a good living
Besides cars and women, this shit gets the bills paid

[Hook]
People of the world, what we living for
That money, fast money, yeah
People of the world, what we dying for
That money, fast money, yeah
Everybody's going crazy for
That money, fast money, yeah
Stroking(?) with your head, I can get some of your
Money, cash money

[Verse 2 - Dr. Dre]
How many niggas can say they got their own
They got their shit together, got a nice stash to do whatever
Ah, you're sitting at home
Hating on the next man that's getting cheddar, trying to get his shit together
I dreamed of hitting licks when I first got in the mix
Way back when DJs was heavy in the crates for breaks
And ain't a damn thing changed but me moving out the firing range
To a blushed out estate
Small technicalities y'all heard for years
Niggas with they problems always out to battle me
But I gets my swerve on, don't give a fuck
It's just a nigga talkin' shit about his bullshit salary

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - King T]
Since talk is extra, it's cut short like Webster
Show me the money or investors
I'm street smart, fuck Elektra
Messing with mine, I get you put on a stretcher
Lock your jaw like a pit bull apply the pressure
Straight 'bout it, building ideas
With self-made millionaires to get the dancefloors crowded
How's that, black limousine, pull up on the scene
Ladies scream, déjà vus over wet dreams
I've got enough cream to cater
Plenty, for any chick that can fade me more than Henny
Plus the remedy to make that hard shit
At the end of the quarter, I'm reaping the largest harvest
If I ain't in LA, sippin' Alizé
Plottin' how to make a meal ticket in a day
All I gotta say is this' a good living
Besides cars and women, this shit gets the bills paid
