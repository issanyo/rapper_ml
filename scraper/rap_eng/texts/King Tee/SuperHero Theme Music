Intro: Aight Aight Look Look,If I Take His Knight . . . You could Have That but You Leaving Ya Bishop Open. But if I f**k with that piece over there,That's gonna put me in position to check mate him. But I gotta be sure,I gotta be sure {Self Talk}

Verse:
Look,This one is for all the chips on the Table
I promise to Keep it Real,No Fables
PAC Said Either Change This World or Let This World Change you
People got Foul Motives,Don't let This World Break You
Fighting Everyday In Grade School
Momma Said They Just Mad Cause They Ain't You
Fast Forward Years Later,Dumb people Still Shallow
It's Crazy How The Good Guy Can Turn Into The Asshole
So be it then Fine
I'm Just writing These Rhymes
You Reciting My Lines
What You Likely To Find
Is The Heart Of A Champion In The Image of God
So If I let You Score, I just Evened The Odds
I ain't Even Suprised
Why You Even Try?!
Why you Let Them Gas You Up?
Why You Believe They Lies?
They Not Really Your Friends!
They Just really Pretend
Seee All that Fake Shyt Really Gets Under My Skin
Trying to Breathe Easy
Ain't No Second Wind(Wins)
But look I Bubbled Once,I figure I do it Again
And Put on For My Block
Watch As I represent
I stayed On Roosevelt Between Boyl & Command
Was A Prince Now A King,Royal In Command
Those That switched up,I owe No Loyalty To them
So first off I'd like to make a Shout out to the name that in times of pain I would Howl Out:
Jesussssss!
God said He Ain't Finish
What I got in store is way better then What You Been In
Better then Benzez,Sneakers,Jewelry & Women
What's better then them Women?
Ain't nothing Wetter then them Women
I like Em Brown Skin Half & Half Lemon Lemon
Got ya girl like "Iced-T,You The Man Lemon Lemon
God damn Lemon Lemon Switch Hands Lemon Lemon
Let me Lucky Licky on Ya Man Lemon Lemon
She even Let me let me Land When I'm Finish
But I ain't Fall in Love, That was The Plan from The Beginning
See Life's a Game of chess Really it's All About position
If You can't take the Mess,You need to stay Up Out the kitchen
I'll feed you food for thought but look you gotta do the dishes
Paying back these student loans just to be somebodies Apprentice ,Nah!
Facing unbeatable Odds,Tryna Beat A System just to Meet up with God
But they Got you fooled,He was there all the time
He was there Thru the dark nights
He was there in my Rhymes
What you hearing is for your spirit not just for the vine
It's become even more apparent that these niggas is lying talking about they moving bricks when they just packaging dimes
I ain't gotta sell dope,Nope
I'm selling these quotes folks hope is what I give Em
Feed Em a lil wisdom,Then sit back & Im chilling
Smoking another villian
Plotting another plan,Making another killing
Ladies like you be The Man
I be like I Be That Nigga Duh!

Hook:
This My Superhero Theme Music
You could Even Sing to It
