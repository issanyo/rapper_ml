Oh yeah, they tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me sayin'

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

Oh yeah, they tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

Shaking her ass from the left to the right
Moving it 'round just the way that I like
I wanna see it move like a movie on flight
She got it how I want it and I want it all night

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me sayin'

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

Ludacris
She got my heart jumpin'
And my adrenalin pumpin' and gunnin'
Like ain't nobody ever seen
As a matter of fact I've seen this woman all up in my dreams

Whippin' and flippin' and stackin' and slappin'
I'm attacking after she back it up and make it drop
After I met her, I tell her David Guetta is on the track
Baby girl don't stop

Keep it going, you never know
When somebody gonna throw couple dollars
Got a pocket full of hundred dollars bills
Ludacris, Mr. Make-A-Woman-Holla, sing

And every night on the floor putting on a show
Everybody in the club
There's a little something you show know

Taio Cruz
Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me sayin'

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl
