[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, press the start button (woo!)
Tell these hoes to press the start button (what!)
Punch in your code and press the start button
And let the muh'fuckin games begin, biatch!
For any ONE of these flows just press the start button
Yea, tell my foes to press the start button
For a Ludacris show, just press the start button
And let the muh'fuckin games begin, biatch!

[Ludacris]
Hey, look here
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Eyes low cause Igloo done rolled the perfect swisha
Hit you with the weaponry, tell your soldiers to back down
I'm Raw like W.E., you'll get SmackDown!
How you want it? I'll clobber my opponents like Blanka
Boy, you Street Fightin with a monster
A-Town mobster, blowin smoke like rastas
Pullin out guns like in Contra, mo' toys than Tonka
I'm a fuckin problem, rob 'em
It's Grand Theft Auto, his burner's right beside him
Hollow points headed to your dome
Hollow points headed to your home
Your head of lettuce shredded from the chrome
It's ludicrous, parents think I'm a weirdo
I'm a God of War, you a Guitar Hero
So let's box like Tyson, you'll get Punched Out
Welcome to Luda's world, now bring the blunts out!
Hahhhhh!

[Ludacris]
I'm Liver than NBA, Luda's Super like Mario
That Playstation 4 shit, you older than Atari ho!
Flows that'll make MC's Go! like Diego
Call me the Master Chief, my life is like Halo
Fightin off haters, I'm the best, ask Khaled
I'm at the Call of Duty, plus my Metal Gear is Solid
My Resident is Evil, full of Southside riders
I hope you're packed, man, I got six Virtua Fighters
That'll blitz ya like Madden '09
Or hit you with the Mac and .49s
Then later sit back and blow pine
Like it's somethin to do, it ain't pretty
The Final Fantasy, they think they live in SimCity
But I'm a MechWarrior, try me and I'll damage ya
Holdin a Soul Calibur, or shoot you like Galaga
And my Creed Assassins ya, so clear the room
Before the shotgun helps you meet your Ultimate Doom, boyyyyy

[Ludacris]
Whether 25 thousand or 25 mil'
Survival of the fittest, either kill or be killed
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on (what?!)
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on
Doesn't matter if it's 25 bricks or it's 25 bucks
Survival of the fittest, either stick or get stuck
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on (what?!)
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on
HEYYYY!
