Born makin money, I growed up in da hood
Yea all the hoes love me cause dey love me real good
Been wearin da same clothes bout 8 days
When they cut the 8 ball when dey flipped it 8 ways
I don't feel clean, but a nigga so paid
Copped da clean white tee with dem fresh Air J's
I ain't got the charger, I got my bitch Escalade
Sippin on dat grey goose and some damn lemonade
Sittin on da block, wise hoppin it ain't nothin
I'm a Trappa Town rapper, still got the hood bumpin
Been through hell and back and I ain't frontin
Niggas talkin bout dough like dey f*ckin sayin somethin
Ohh I gotta have it

Dey feelin on the big dipper, let em play with it stop
But they don't wanna f*ck me, they wanna F*CK MY COCK
I'm the bearskin rug, no shoes or socks
So on 3, you and the coop gotta lose your tops
See I'm addicted to the paper I been gettin for years
And my whip is all white, I call it Britney Spears
They say life is like a circus when you stuck on the block
So we don't snitch and eat pork, we don't f*ck with the cops
And that's why I'll be gettin paper til the day that I die
So like Monica Lewinsky, keep your head up high... cause
Ohh I gotta have it

It's the son of the preacher, but raised by the dope lady
Talkin get money, pimp hard so niggas gon hate me
I got a good heart, and a good brain
You heard my gangsta story, my life was off the chain
My momma flipped the cane, and pop was up at church
The Joe had me in the hallway with the purp
Prayin that I stay safe and I don't get murked
But I bet I get paid, make that money work
Hittin garages, I bet I got a nigga vert
Let me holla at ya bitch, I'll make dat pussy hurt (yea)
For real though, you know that I get dough
