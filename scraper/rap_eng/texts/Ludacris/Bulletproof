[Intro Raheem DeVaughn ]

Load It, Cock It, Aim and Shoot
Load It, Cock It, Aim and Shoot

[Hook Raheem DeVaughn]

Living like we bulletproof
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
I say we load it, cock it, aim and shoot
Oh we load it, cock it, aim and shoot

[Verse 1 Raheem DeVaughn]
Some will die over oil kill over land
Charge you for taxes and Blame Uncle Sam
Read you your rights and charge you for nothing
Now who’s really gangsta
And tell me who’s frontin’
Murder your sons, ravage your daughters
Here overseas and across the waters
Tanks and missiles, bombs and grenades
Inject the land with guns and aids

You better pray to the most high or who ever you praise
Politicians can’t help you they puppets to slaves
Trying to get paid and you are too
Whatcha gone do when the gun is pointed at you
Like bank robbers

[Hook]

[Verse 2 Raheem DeVaughn]
Get you a paper turn on the news
Ride through the hood I witness the blues
How can you ignore it it’s easy to spot it
A trap house, a liquor store and your city’s got it

And my city’s got it, and they city’s got it
This world is chaotic and love is symbolic
So life don’t get cherished, and our babies perish
And your babies perish now tell me who’s careless
Now who should I pray to what should I pray for
You can’t pay the preacher for your redemption
I know where we’re headed, I already read it
The good book done said it
Like cowboys and Indians

[Hook]

[Verse 3 Ludacris]
Luda! they say tomorrow’s not promised today
But today I promise if we don’t make our own way
Somebody’ll take it from us
Snatch it like rats to cheese
So, lord help me please cause I rather die
On my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I’m bulletproof
Cocking the Glock and aim n shoot
My future’s ever clear a 180 proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride
And drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreaming of betta days dreaming of betta pay
But we got our work cut out for us so we betta pray
Pray to uphold the week, not for eternal sleep
But if I die I pray the lord my soul to keep

[Hook]

[Outro : Ludacris]

I say I load it, cock it, aim and shoot
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
