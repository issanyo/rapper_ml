I'll be the last one standing
Two hands in the air, I'm a champion
You'll be looking up at me when it's over
I live for the battle, I'm a soldier, yeah
I'm a fighter like Rocky
Put you flat on your back like Alli
Yeah, I'm the greatest, I'm stronger
Paid my dues, can't lose, Imma own ya, ay
I've been working my whole life
And now it's do or die
I am invincible, unbreakable
Unstoppable, unshakeable
They knock me down, I get up again
I am the champion
You're gonna know my name
You can't hurt me now
I can't feel the pain
I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win
I am the champion
When they write my story
They're gonna say that I did it for the glory
But don't think that I did it for the fame, yeah
I did it for the love of the game, yeah
And this is my chance I'm taking
All them old records I'm breaking
All you people watching on the TV
You go ahead and put your bets on me, ay
I've been waiting my whole life
To see my name in lights
I am invincible, unbreakable
Unstoppable, unshakeable
They knock me down, I get up again

The C is for the courage I possess through the armor
H is for the hurt but it's all for the honor
A is for my attitude working through the patience
Money comes and goes so the M is for motivation
Gotta stay consistent, the P is to preserver
The I is for integrity, innovative career
The O is optimistic, open and never shut
And the N is necessary 'cause I'm never giving up
See they ask me how I did it, I just did it from the heart
Crushing the competition, been doing it from the start
They say that every champion is all about his principles
