[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You're beautiful, beautiful, you should know it
Beautiful, beautiful, you should know it
I think it's time, think it's time that you show it
You're beautiful, beautiful

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby what you doin'?
Where you at? Where you at?
Why you acting so shy?
Holdin' back, holdin' back
We're not the only ones doin' it like that, it like that
So DJ, bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back

[Chorus. Justin Bieber]
Cause all around the world people want to be loved, yeah
Cause all around the world, they're no different than us
All around the world people want to be loved
All around the world, they're no different than us
All around the world-world-world
All around the world-world-world

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You're crazy girl, crazy girl, you should know it
You're crazy girl, crazy girl, don't control it
Light it up, light it up so explosive
Crazy girl, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby what you doin'?
Where you at? Where you at?
Why you acting so shy?
Holdin' back, holdin' back
We're not the only ones doin' it like that, it like that
So DJ, bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back

[Chorus. Justin Bieber]
Cause all around the world people want to be loved, yeah
Cause all around the world, they're no different than us
All around the world people want to be loved
All around the world, they're no different than us
All around the world-world-world
All around the world-world-world

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, once again, the dynamic duo is back at it
JB, Luda
I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itchin' for beauty, but just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it then don't give in
Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

[Chorus. Justin Bieber]
Cause all around the world people want to be loved, yeah
Cause all around the world, they're no different than us
All around the world people want to be loved
All around the world, they're no different than us
All around the world-world-world
All around the world-world-world
