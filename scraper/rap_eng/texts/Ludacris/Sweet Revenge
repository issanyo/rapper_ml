[Ludacris]
Hello?

[Woman]
Baby you will not believe this
This nigga ain't been home in three days
His kids runnin all over my house
I don't know what to do
He comes in and out the house all times of the night
His girls keep calling my phone
They blowing it up calling back and forth wanting to cuss at me
I can't take this no more
I'm not sittin up in this house no more
He can have this
I need to come see you baby
Can I please come see you baby?

[Hook: Ludacris]
One, here's what you do
Now my name's Ludacris but please meet my crew
Two, say, there's no time to play
Bring a box of Magnums and get blown away, hey
Three, there's no changing me
I'm a pimp for most and it's plain to see
Four, I'm so glad if he made you mad
I know a way to get back that'll make you glad, you heard?

[Ludacris]
Hello?

[Woman]
Cris, I just caught this motherfucker cheating with my best friend
I cannot believe this shit

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Oh, it's no time to fret
Come quick with my favorite bra and panty set
Yep, oh, bust through the door
Slide off the mink coat and throw it on the floor
Oh, yep, climb up the stairs
Keep your high heels on and let down your hair
Yep, oh, let me grease them thighs
Then turn it on around and get a back massage
Oh, yep, cause I aim to please
We can take our little time it ain't a thang to me
Yep, oh, I'm just along for the ride
So turn this way and let me kiss down the side
Oh, yep, and then it's off with your garments
And please hold on while we shake the apartment
Yep, oh, and pop a bobble of bub
And before we go again we can jump in the tub, yea

[Woman]
Thank you baby, I needed that
So when we gonna do this again?

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Hello?

[Woman]
Cris, this nigga's stressin me
I gotta get away
I just need some time away right now
Boo, can you please come see me?

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Wait, no need to explain
I got a first-class ticket, just get on the plane
Yep, oh, and do your gangster strut
There'll be a stretch limousine that'll pick you up
Oh, yep, bring it straight to me
I'll be on the top floor, hit the penthouse suite
Yep, oh, come on out your threads
And get wet, the shower got about fifty heads
Oh, yep, blow a sack with me
And head come on outside to the balcony
Yep, oh, you're a popular girl
But I'd like to introduce you to the top of the world
Oh, yep, and let the games begin
Don't you love the way the breeze just hits your skin
Yep, oh, before we do it again
Hold tight and I can call up a couple of friends, yep

[Woman]
Thank you baby
You're always there when I need you
I love you for that

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Hello?

[Woman]
Ay, estoy cansada ese negro
Solo que perder este pendejo

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Oh, wipe your tears away
Give your boy 10 minutes cause I'm on my way
Yep, oh, and quit the whoopty whoop
Cause I bet you never rolled in a Bentley coupe
Oh, yep, the inside is snug
Take your boots off and baby put your feet on the rug
Yep, oh, and put the drinks aside
Just lay back kick it and enjoy the ride
Oh, yep, let the speakers bleed
And I hope you don't mind if I increase the speed
Yep, oh, feel the engine thrust
Let it flow through your body, your adrenaline rush
Oh, yep, I know it turns you on
Feeling like you're in a place where you really belong
Yep, oh, go and grab your clutch
And I can make you come again without a single touch, uh

[Woman]
Ay, gracias por todo papi
Ay, te amo papi
