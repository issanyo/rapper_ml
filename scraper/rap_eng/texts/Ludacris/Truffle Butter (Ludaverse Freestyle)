[Intro]
Yaah, yaah
Fresh out, ha
Luda!
DTP, hey
Ludaverses, aah, you know
Lyrical exercise
Another freestyle
Listen, ha!

[Verse]
Flyer than a G6
Another Luda verse, no, this is not a remix
Leak this; so wavy you get seasick
But that's none of my business, so Kermit tea sip
He sick, we're flipping the sixteen
Addicted to getting cream, attempted to sip lean
But I'd rather take a shot of that Louis the Sixteen
That's right, I'm a fit king, see me on the big screen
April 3rd, Fast and Furious, doing these big things
Then dropping that Ludaversal same week, get me
My neck and my wrist bling from the money 'Cris bring
Black interior, but whip whiter than whipped cream
Big dreams into 2015 with steam
Cooking in the studio, serving to get fiends
Home makeover, the mansion is extreme
Game takeover, I'm balling to get rings
Groupie women looking, they trying to get seen
Money over bitches, I'm trying to get green
Dirty South criminal trying to get clean
Checkmating pawns that's trying to get kings, aah!

[Outro]
(laughs)
Yeah!
Short but sweet
March 31st, Ludaversal, baby
April 3rd, the seventh fucking installment of the Fast and Furious franchise
We work it!
I'm just getting started
