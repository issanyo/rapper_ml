[Intro x2: Ludacris]
HA HA HA
A-Town Connected
Lloyd (Check)
Luda (Check) turn it up and make it knock (knock)
East, West, North, South beat'n on down your block (block)

[Verse 1:]
First off let me mention I've been missin
But I'm back on the scene
A-Town in the building n you can feel
Cause the swagger is mean
We the ones that made ya snap ya fingas and get on the floor
N now the king is back
And I'm a show you how it goes

[Chorus:]
If ya girls get on the floor
Betcha I can make lil mama get *LOW*
See around here we got that game n anything else is gotta go
We popin bottles
Droppin Models
N makin it rain up in the club
OH!
And no this ain't no game
That's just how we around my way
Yeah I know ya miss it
So I'm a make ya feel it
There ain't no other way
That's just how we around my way
Get Wild, Get Crunk, Get Low
Everybody get on the floor
Wait awhile and I'm a make you say
That's just how we around my way

[Verse 2:]
I hit the club
It's 3 A.M
So time to get it started
No disrespect lil mama I'm tipsy from that other party
The way ya hatas on me, Ah hook yaself a drink
When ya get this here I'm a make it clear my level can't be reached

[Chorus:]
If ya girls get on the floor
Betcha I can make lil mama get *LOW*
Ya see around here we got that game n anything else is gotta go
We popin bottles
Droppin Models
N makin it rain up in the club
OH!
And no this ain't no game
That's just how we around my way
Yeah I know ya miss it (ohhh)
So I'm a make you feel it (ohh baby)
There ain't no other way
That's just how we around my way
Get Wild, Get Crunk, Get Low
Everybody get on the floor
Wait awhile and I'm a make you say
That's just how we around my way

[vers 3: Ludacris]
This is just how we do it
This is just how it goes
This is just how we slip off out of the bed and move it on down to the floor
OHH!
Ludas a BEAST
Luda get to it and put em to sleep
Luda got millions of dollars, sold millions of records n luda still be in the street
Heat got all over the beat
1, 000 threads all over my feet
COUNT IT
Hatas get mad at the boy cause they makin they life what I make in a week
COUNT IT
ATL country as hell
Strapped every part of the day
It's 22 women to every 1 man
And THATS HOW WE DO IT IN THE "A"

[Chorus:]
OHHHH!
Yeah I know ya miss it
So I'm a make you feel it
There ain't no other way
That's just how we around my way
Get Wild, Get Crunk, Get Low
Everybody get on the floor
Wait awhile and I'm a make you say
That's just how we around my way
