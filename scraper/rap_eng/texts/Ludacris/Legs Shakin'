[Intro: R. Kelly]
(I'ma make your legs shake, I'ma make your leg)
Tonight’ll be different from any other night
(I'ma-I'mma make your legs shake, leg shake)
Tonight I wanna hear you screamin’ ooohhh (yeeaahh)
(I'ma make your legs shake, I'ma make your leg)
And I’m gonna give you the reasons why I'mma make your leg
(I'ma-I'mma make your legs shake, leg shake)
Baby baby baby baby

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I’m goin’ down down down
And do it ‘til your legs’ shakin’
Do it ‘til your legs’ shakin’
Do it ‘til your leg (oohhh)
I’m going down down down
And do it ‘til your legs’ shakin’
Do it ‘til your legs’ shakin’
Do it ‘til your leg (oohhh)

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Dead in the middle of the club, I spotted at her
Shorty’s so tough, I think I’m in love
Imagination goin’ crazy
Think I wanna make her my lady
And the way that she get so freaky
I just wanna give her a baby
And then I’m gonna get her wide open
Give her what she been missin’ and feelin’
Lick it ‘til she’s shiverin’ oooh
And then I’m gonna look her in her eyes and tell her
I love her, I love her, I love her…

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'ma make ya shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Ain’t nothing gonna interrupt this mood we’re in
They can call all they want they can knock all they want
But they won’t get in (no!)
Not tonight cause I’m about to make my mark on you
Girl you are my world, my piece of paradise
If you let me do (let me do) what I want to you
Girl I promise through this whole night I’ll be kissin’ you
Until your body cums, until we see the sun
Send you into to shock girl once I touch you with my taser tongue
And then I just wanna get her wide open
Give her what she been missin’ and feelin’
Lick it ‘til she’s shiverin’ oooh
And then I’m gonna look her in her eyes and tell her
I love her, I love her, I love her…

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Luda! Haha
Wait for it, wait for it
Let me tell you what I'mma do right quick
(What'cha gon’ do?) Listen
I'ma start from the forehead to lips to the neck to the chest
Flip her over then I’m kissin’ down her backside
Flip her over again I’m ready to go for a swim
I'mma make her body tremble if she act right
Make her as woozy as woozy get
Feelin’ like we on a movie set
Can you feel the vibrations?
My tongue just like a Jacuzzi jet
I put your man to shame wit it
I don’t play no games wit it
Imma have you grippin’ the sheets screamin’
When I write your name wit it
First, last, middle
And my tongue just likes to scribble
Morning, noon, and night I gotta have it
I’m a dog eat it up like bits and kibbles
Make me dribble like CP3, but I rep that DTP
So if you gimme that, I’mma give you that
One leg up over my shoulder
Let me be your remote controller
Let me try to keep my composure
So many different ways that I can fold ya
Oh yea I go to town girl
You should keep me around (oohhh)
Cause every night I’m goin’

[Hook] + [Bridge x3]

[Outro]
So uhh
What'chu think about that? Hahahah
Yeah, I thought you would
No I like it too, it’s cool
