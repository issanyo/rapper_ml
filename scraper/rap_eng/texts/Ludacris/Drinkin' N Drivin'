[Hook: Young Jeezy]
On 285, on 285, I don't know where I'm goin' on 285, I drink when I drive
I just love when I'm high, I don't know here I'm goin', on 285, on 285 (x2)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I come equipped with 2 straps on my lap, move back, 45 tucked by my side
Sip a little bit of this, sip that, drink up, I'm so drunk when I drive
I'm wood grain, grippin' and tippin' on some 24's
I puff the magic dragon and then blow smoke out of my nose
I try to tell 'em ain't nothing changed, but the mileage on the range
It's baby powder white, and I whip it like cocaine
All up and down 285, and I'm goin around in circles man
My partners call me Prince, cause they know I got that Purple Rain
Burners along my waist belt, gotta pull up my pants like I'm Urkel, man
My girlfriend said, "You sure?" I said, "Bitch, I'm for certain, man!"
I'm hurtin' the game so bad, they can't keep up when I'm counting this scrilla
My momma quit her job, cause I got her workin with six figures
Yes, she's workin' with six figures, and niggas is workin' like some slaves
She retired a little bit early, because her son is fuckin' paid
And she ain't gotta do shit but be rich and stay alive
And once an awhile just take her Lexus and drive on 285
