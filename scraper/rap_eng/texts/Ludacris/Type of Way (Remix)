[Pre-Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
My niggas been hustlin' trying to make him something
Ain't no telling what he'll do for the paper
Soufflé
I'm straight, I steak my plate
Sade, I'm a smooth operator

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
(I drop the top of my whip baby!)
That car I'm driving make you feel some type of way
That custom Breitling make you feel some type of way
This bitch I'm with got me feelin' some type a way
Is it because my homies rich you feel some type of way?
Some type of way, make you feel some type of way
Heard she wana fuck me, know you feel some type of way
Mr. CEO is what my title say
Me and my homies G'd your ho, he feel some type of way

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Ok now let’s be real I know you feel some type of way
When I get to biting on her ear she make that Tyson face
I drop down to my knees thankful for life today
No naps since long sleep; hibernate
I can tell if he tell if he 12, right away
Go through hell cause I care, move you far away
Drop you off late, know he feel some type of way
I got hoes like golf trynna make what Tiger made
I got a hide away, and I go there sometimes, to give my mind a break
I find a way, to still get through struggle, what I’m tryna say
And I ain't lying today when i tell you that I love…

[Pre-Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
My niggas been hustlin' trying to make him something

Soufflé

Sade, I'm a smooth operator

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
(I drop the top of my whip baby!)
That car I'm driving make you feel some type of way

Some type of way, make you feel some type of way

[Verse 2 - Ludacris]
I give yo girl a dose of this and now the bitch won’t leave me alone
Got pictures of her bustin' it
Wide open all on my mobile phone
She come straight to my house and don’t say shit
She just get in bed
I 15 second Instragram'd the video of that bitch givin' me head
Steady overdosin, we tokin on the best sativa plants
We done smoke that loud
Our shit screamin like Justin Bieber fans
Tried to tell 'em I was born to get high
You would think my daddy Snoop
Yall couldn’t get high if CP3 threw you the alley-oop
I crossover you fake hoes
Fat as hell, I’m in cake mode
Too overweight, lift up my shirt and look at all of these bankrolls
Tell the waitress just to keep them bottles coming
Tell the DJ to play this
Red pill, blue pill, bitch I’m all in the Matrix
I drink a 5th of that straight up
Cars and houses all paid up
My women bodies aren’t real
Yo women bodies are made up
In a way you’ll catch me drinkin' on the Lear
Drop the bottle and twist the cap and all you haters that ain’t here
Feel some type of way, nigga

[Pre-Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
My niggas been hustlin' trying to make him something

Some type of way, make you feel some type of way
Heard she wana fuck me, know you feel some type of way

Me and my homies G'd your ho, he feel some type of way

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
She got a Georgia peach on her rear end like a licence plate
No rookie, girl scout cookie got me high today
I probably make, more money in six months
Than what's in your papa's safe
Look like I robbed a bank
I set it off like Queen Latifah, cause I'm living single
I'm feeling cautious, I ain't scream when they served a subpoena
I heard that he the leader, come follow my tribe today
I fucked her now he heated, he feel some type of way
Don't know how to say, ain't the hardest man working?
Attention we pay, there's always a man lurking
No man perfect, but God
My head, I nod
Rich, homie, ugn...

[Pre-Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
