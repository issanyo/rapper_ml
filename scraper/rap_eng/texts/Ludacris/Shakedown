[Intro]
Open up your books to the page of yes

[Verse 1]
Throw your hands up for that young nigga from way back, sporting the "A" hat
Spinning wheels, more fortunes than Pat Sajak
Hit the playback 'cause I'm stupid with it
Track hard like stone, you'd think Medusa did it
Please believe me, it's so easy
That cold Neptune shit is so for reazzy
I'm countin G-stacks, so tell 'em ease back
A hundred to spin, so cocksucker, beat that
Numerous bank rolls, don't get your face swolled
And tell your hombres I'm comin for they pesos
'Cause it's that snatch back, call us the Splack Pack
Broke your cousin, put your mama in a hatchback
And I ain't playing with you, I'm just praying wit you
Hoping that the fertilizer ain't laying wit you
You all grouped up, I caught a grouper
And slide off 'cause the Chevrolet swooped up

[Hook]
Fellas, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them
Ladies, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them

[Verse 2]
Somebody hurry up, please, and call an ambulance, I caused an avalnnche
With nuts so big, I walk around with Hammer pants
Raps will slap a man, make you do the Hammer dance
My basslines thump with more funk than Pakistan
Come from a vast block, I was a have-not
But now I keep at least a hundred in the stash box
I had a cash plot to get a fat knot
I threw my album in the slot and hit the jackpot
So, nigga, ching ching, I did the thing, thing
Four months later, my mama's like, "bling bling"
Just lke George and 'Ouise, I was moving up
And fuck a platinum plaque, I'm doing two and up
Not for the short chains, y'all shooting short range
But it was either rap limelight or court things
So I Just made do until it came through
Throughout the ups and downs, I still stayed true

[Hook]
Fellas, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them
Ladies, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them

[Verse 3]
All you weak rappers, wipe your feet off on my doormat and get your flow back
Or try to run and get traced down like LoJack
Down like four flats, you better know that
I take the four and put a zero on your throwback
That's how that thing go, you'll hear that thing blow
So hurry up and do like my dick, hang low
Got the perpetrators yelling, "Let the lame go!"
Up on your good foot or I'll shoot you in the same toe

[Hook]
Fellas, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them
Ladies, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them
