[Intro: Ludacris]
Yeah ..
Disturbing the peace (Here's another one.)
Jarvis, ATL, LUDA! (untouchables)
And this next one goes out to
All the pretty girls all over the world
So if you a pretty girl and you know it
This song's for you

[Verse 1: Jarvis]
Aye, pretty girl, so what's ya name
I like the way that you walk and I dig your frame
(So I) When I call, when I go, I wanna go with you (and I)
Wanna conversate, girl can I talk to you
Girl where ya from, and what ya doing?
Must be a model, loookin' bad as you do
What's up with me and you, planning a rendezvous
Girl it's whatever, so what's good with you?

[Pre-Hook: Jarvis]
She got that kind of face that you would only see on an angel
A body that looks good to me from every angle
I wanna get her all alone, hope she lets me take her home
I only get down like that because...

[Hook: Jarvis]
She's a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl (x8)

[Verse: 2: Jarvis]
Girl you's a beast, a 23
That means you're worth two 10's plus a 3 (And I)
Ain't neva seen that in my neighborhood (shawty)
You got me goin' like I knew you would
You got me under your spell
Feels like I'm locked in a jail (Oh, I)
And I don't wanna get out
I never knew being locked up could feel so good

[Pre-Hook & Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Now listen here
She got the face of an angel and the girl is so fly
That her eyes stay twinkling like she stole them out the sky
I love her to switch her hips cause everytime she walks by
I see a big old onion booty and it makes me wanna cry
And she's so adventurous, sweeter than licorice
Hey, pretty girl, come here, are you ticklish?
Tickle this, tickle me, like "Tickle Me Elmo"
I asked if she got down on the first date, and she said, "Hell no!"
She said to take it slow and it'll take mo' for you to please me
I said, "Good cause I don't want it if it's that easy"
Tease me like a stripper, bite me like a snicker
She sounds like the North Star and I'm a Big Dipper
I'm quick to pick her upper like Bounty, but her wetness never drown me
Skin soft like fabric soft Downy
And I always keep her smiling, Cause mostly she's me silly girl
But really she's my pretty, pretty, pretty, my pretty girl

[Hook]
