[Intro: Ludacris]
Black by popular demand
Okay, Okay, Okay
Okay, Okay
You's a hoe
You's a hoe
These Ludaverses and You's a hoe

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Nothing to it but to do it
I'm all about that dumb shit
South Side College Park
Nigga you don't run shit
My janitors mop the floor
Be careful hoe
You're slippin' up
I heard them boys was deep
But we don't really give a fuck
See one of my niggas will fight two of yo niggas
And then a bunch you niggas is Gone drop
Got a bunch of gorillas ,with drug dealers and killers
None of these niggas is ever gonna stop
I had enough of this playing disrespect
It's time to let a nigga know
Dangled a nigga from the top of a balcony
Like Suge Knight
But I better let a nigga go
I'll teach you about some manners
I'll teach you about respect
I'll teach you about that gold chain
Hanging around your motherfuckin' neck
Check J's, watch, pinky ring
I ain't done
Pack up at all your shit
And head back where you came from
Nigga I ain't the one
So miss me with that bullshit
Internet thumb thuggers empty out a full click
Time after time
Like I'mma take it up after I wake up
But rhyme after rhyme, Ludacris spit a verse
And rappers just shake up
I'm all about my paper
I could give a damn about a hater later
So all my niggas from Decauter
Will make ya step up like Zeta Phi Beta
Ya'll really hurt my feelings
Ya'll really gots to chill
I cry and wipe my tears
With hundred dollar bills
Fuck ya'll I'm self-made
I hustle hard
I've been Trill
Couple of checks from that Hollywood
But I'm hungry with that pen still
Got hits way over ya'll head
Ya'll ball in that infield
Got 10 houses all paid for
Ya'll niggas pay rent still
How you feeling about that, bitchy ass nigga?

[Outro: Ludacris]
Ludaversal March 31st
Be afraid
Be very afraid
