Some days I think I love my whip more than I love my bitch
Everytime we argue I just hop up in my whip and split
And my car never talk back to me
It just turn up and play this track for me
Then my girl get jealous and try to wild on her
Calling her used cuz the Acura got so many miles on her
And try to make her feel inferior
Since I'm rubbing all on my Acura's interior
Whenever I'm with either of my ladies I just love her
See cuz one rides me while I ride in the other mane
I'm bout to go get in some trouble mane
With the one that's like my sidekick the other thinks she my mother mane
And I ain't with that
They both got mean bodies but with this Maserati see how I trip that
Pretty feet with nice paint and they both drop the top
And both crushing everything in the parking lot
Gone
