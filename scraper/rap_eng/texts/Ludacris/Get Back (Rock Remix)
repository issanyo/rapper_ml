[Intro]
Yea, special edition. Rock and roll, it's Ludacris. Yea
And Sum 41, baby! Here's another one
Get back, live studio [?]
It's another one

[Chorus]
(Yeek-Yeek Woop-Woop) I ain't playin' around
Make one false move, I'll take you down
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that

[Verse 1]
So, so, come on, come on
DON'T get swung on, swung on
It's the knick-knack-patty-whack, still riding Cadillacs
Family off the streets, made my homies put the baggies back
Still snaggin' plaques, still action-packed
And dope, I keep it flippin' like acrobats
That's why I pack a Mac, that'll crack a back
'Cause on my waist there's more heat than the Shaq Attack!
But I ain't speaking' about ballin', ballin'
Just' thinkin' about brawlin' 'til y'all start ballin'
We all in together now, birds of the feather now
Just bought a plane so we changin' the weather now
So put your brakes on, Caps put your capes on
And knock off your block, get dropped, and have your face blown
'Cause I'll prove it, scratch off the music
Like hey little stupid, don't make me lose it!

[Chorus]
(Yeek-Yeek Woop-Woop) Why you all in my ear
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit I ain't tryin' to hear?
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Yeek-Yeek Woop-Woop) I ain't playin' around
Make one false move, I'll take you down
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that

[Bridge]
I came (I came), I saw (I saw), I hit him right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)
I came (I came), I saw (I saw), I hit him right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)
I came (I came), I saw (I saw), I hit him right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)
I came (I came), I saw (I saw), I hit him right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)

[Verse 2]
Ya see, I caught him with a right hook, caught him with a jab
Caught him with an upper cut, kicked him in his ass
Sent him on his way 'cause I ain't for that talk
And no trips to the county, I ain't for that walk
We split like two pins at the end of a lane
We'll knock out your spotlight and put end to your fame
Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo' chain
And put the booty of a Swisha at the end of a flame

[Chorus]
(Yeek-Yeek Woop-Woop) Why you all in my ear
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit I ain't tryin' to hear?
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Yeek-Yeek Woop-Woop) I ain't playin' around
Make one false move, I'll take you down
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that

[Bridge 2]
Ho, hey, you want WHAT with me?
I'm gonna tell you one time, don't FUCK with me
Get down! 'Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
And I'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you

Ho, hey, you want WHAT with me?
I'm gonna tell you one time, don't FUCK with me
Get down! 'Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
And I'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you

[Verse 3]
Man, 'cause I don't wanna do that
I want to have a good time and enjoy my Jack
Sit back and watch some women get drunk as hell
So I can wake up in the morning with a story to tell
I know it's been a little while since I've been out the house
But now I'm here, you want to stand around running yo' mouth?
I can't hear nothing you saying or spitting, so what's up?
Don't you see we in the club? Man, shut the fuck up!

[Chorus]
(Yeek-Yeek Woop-Woop) Why you all in my ear
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit I ain't tryin' to hear?
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Yeek-Yeek Woop-Woop) I ain't playin' around
Make one false move, I'll take you down
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that

[Outro]
Uh oh, we in the Red Light District!
What! We in the Red Light District!
Sum 41! Red Light District!
Yes! And Ludacris! We in the Red Light District!
It's the rock and roll version! Red Light District!
It's the Red Light District!
The Red Light District
So yeah, get back
It's the Red Light District
[I'll be done today?]
Disturbin' the Peace
The Red Light District
And we out
