[Intro: Jeezy]
Fresh up out the shower, smelling like some money
Spent another hour thinking bout some money
These nigga' want the fame, bitch I want some money
See ain't nothing changed, I just want some money
This for them hatin' niggas and them hatin' hoes I can't forget
I been on the Avion all night, you know I'm lit
She say Young your neck sick look like it need a check up
I say bitch one thing about I try to run the check up

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
My neck's game killin', wrist game killin'
Hop up out this motherfucker smelling like some millions
Right hand cross your heart, other hand to the ceiling
Say bitch I was born broke just know I'm dying with these millions
Wrist game proper, keep that chopper
And take surgery with them squares I play doctor
Go to sleep thinking check, wake up thinking check
[?] Young will not rest till all my niggas get a check
Bitch you know I'm bout it and you know I got it
Like my cars, like my bitches and my bitches they exotic
No need for a money counter, we'll just thumb through it
We'll count the 10's and the 5's we just let them ones do it

[Hook: Jeezy]
I say I want that paper, need that paper
Hustling in my veins, I just bleed that paper
Nothing on my mind but some money: Las Vegas
When you run it up old bitches catch vapors
I just wanna check, I just need a check
See I can't even lie right now I'm thinkin' 'bout a check
Put somethin' in my safe, put a lock around my neck
That's why I'm always on my grind cause I'm tryna run up checks

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Whoever said money was the root of all evil never had none
And rappers that say record sales don't matter never went Platinum
I'm not a gold rapper but these women call me Magnum
And the baddest bitches live in Atlanta just in case you never had one
99 problems and money will solve most of 'em
Sisters havin' issues my penis'll solve both of 'em
Haters takin' shots, I pop some bottles and toast to 'em
Got a DUI, bought a Phantom now someone chauffeurs 'em
Money don't buy happiness but buy a place to sleep
I'd rather cry up in my mansion than to cry out on the streets
Used to exercise daily but fuck it I'm really fed up
Now the only exercise I do is run the check up

[Hook: Jeezy]
I say I want that paper, need that paper
Hustling in my veins, I just bleed that paper
Nothing on my mind but some money: Las Vegas
When you run it up old bitches catch vapors
I just wanna check, I just need a check
See I can't even lie right now I'm thinkin' 'bout a check
Put somethin' in my safe, put a lock around my neck
That's why I'm always on my grind cause I'm tryna run up checks

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
One thing about it nigga, I'ma run the check up
Whip game sick, yeah my shit might need a check up
See first you get the money then you get the haters
Don't let that shit distract you gotta be focused on your paper
100 for a 16, used to pay 16 for a kilo
Lord bless the trap and hallelujah to my 'migos
Tryna get a check know the check right up
All my bitches ghost got one jet lagging
Chopper shoot like a jet fighter
Touch more keys than a typewriter
I was in the kitchen after school call that shit detention
I'm a star player, I'm on fire, you was on the benches
Yeah coach Gotti, Calipari shit
Feds ridin', that's some scary shit
I got old money but the new money, I don't want nothin' but them Harriet, Tubmans

[Hook: Jeezy]
I say I want that paper, need that paper
Hustling in my veins, I just bleed that paper
Nothing on my mind but some money: Las Vegas
When you run it up old bitches catch vapors
I just wanna check, I just need a check
See I can't even lie right now I'm thinkin' 'bout a check
Put somethin' in my safe, put a lock around my neck
That's why I'm always on my grind cause I'm tryna run up checks
