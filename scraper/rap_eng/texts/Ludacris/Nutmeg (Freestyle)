[Verse]
Stay calm, this ain’t ‘bout to take long
Fake rappers meme muggin’ put your face on
I got some verses hot enough to broil a steak on
It’s goin down, put your emergency brake on
Your time’s up it’s like your callin’ from a payphone
It’s like I stepped in the booth and just put my cape on
In the Cadillac with fake plates on
We blowin’ bomb like the blunts filled with napalm
We got four bad chicks we bout to take off
Just tryna get they bottoms up, word up to Trey Songz
Somebody call the doctor and wait for him
I’m gettin’ neck and she about to need a brace on
I’m standing up so she can keep a straight face on
She got a ass you finna conjure case on
Boogie Nights, I’m the one the movie was based on
Entourage dyked up, I got my Vinnie Chase on
Let ‘em play with each other, have a taste-off
Then I’m the last one in like the 8 ball
All up in they dugouts, no baseball
Splatter on they chests like I hit ‘em with a paintball
Now in the clouds like Nate Dogg
Smokin’ with my family guys, no Quahog
Catch the troy weed, shit’ll take your face off
Rappers act hard, I guess they verses just play soft
Bitch ass nigga
