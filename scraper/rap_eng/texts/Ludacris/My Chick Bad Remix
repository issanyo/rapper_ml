[Hook:Ludacris]
My chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
My-my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
My-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours
My-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours
My-my-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours
My-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours

[Verse 1: LYRiiC MooLAnii]
All these dudes claim they explore & they the piper
Still ain't met a nigga that could muthafuckin' swipe her
Treat her like a Facebook post they really like her
She's a boss bitch team bossy you can't wife her
Gettin' my stack on, Trident layers
If you don't like me that's great cause I love haters
Lyrically Equipped stand back you in my radar
I'll leave yo' skull in black like the muthafuckin' Raiders
Yes I'm a writer I don't freestyle shit
And if you callin' me whack, yous a lyin' ass trick
My flow so cold these bitches rockin' purple lips
And they stuck on my tracks like my bars glued in

[Verse 2: LYRiiC MooLAnii]
Verse two cause I ain't done yet
Bitches turn the oven up cause I ain't done yet
I'm only half baked so imagine when I finish
I'll fold these broads and stuff em' in the closet, linens
Give your grill some permanent work, Dentist
These hoes actin' like they got injections, lippin'
After I spit they be flippin', gymnast
Ima Hussle like Nipsey but I ain't crippin'
Stick up wit' it but I'm never constipated
Should I murk everybody, I contemplated
Bitch I'll take yo' head, muthafuckin' plate it
Eat your brains for dinner you're a veggie I pureed it
