Motto motto

Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way

Oh no! The fight's out
I'm bout to punch your lights out
Get the fuck back, guard your grill
There's something wrong, we can't stay still
I've been dranking and busting too
And I been thanking of busting you
Upside your motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in, they'll be mo' dead
Causing confusion, Disturbin' Tha Peace
It's not an illusion, we running the streets
So bye-bye to all you groupies and gold diggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? No nigga!
I'm doing a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the fuck outta my way
I'm D.U.I., hardly ever caught sober
And you abouts to get ran the fuck over

Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way

Here I come, here I go
Uh oh, don't jump bitch: move!
You see them headlights? You hear that fuckin' crowd?
Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through
Hit the stage and knock the curtains down
I fuck the crowd up - that's what I do
Young and successful - a sex symbol
The bitches want me to fuck 'em
