Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I heard a rumor I was broke
They said Luda ain't got no green backs
You people must be smokin', dope
So kill yourself you if you believe that
Forbes lits cash king, 8 years in a row
In fact I'm still  making money
Off that song, "You's a Ho"
These artists scare of success
Money and power they abuse it
Instead of making up these lies
Why don't ya'll make some better music
I'm back rapping and going strong
Like I'm with Tigger in the basment
Album taken to fuckin, long
I told my fans, just to be patient
I told em' I apologize, been doin too other work
Too many people talkin' shit
Now Luda's, got to go bezerk
EP comin' in Decemeber
Just talking bout how it hurts
And finally that Ludaversal
It's dropping March 31st
And Imma have the club up

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
Working Monday night, on the corner flipping hard
Made at least three thousand, on the Boulevard
I've been working graveyard, shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fucking time to party on the weekend
I've been flipping in the house, making juugs on the highway
I've been riding out of state, making money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon have another drink
I'm doing my stance, you know my Molly pink
I've got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn about what she think
