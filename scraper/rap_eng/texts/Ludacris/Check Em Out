Check em out, check em out, check em out
Check em out, check em out, check em out
Check em out, check em out, check em out
(Word up!)
Check em out, check em out, check em out
Check em out, check em out, check em out
Check em out, check em out, check em out
(Word up!)
Get fresh, get fresh, get fresh
Get fresh, get fresh, get fresh
Get fresh, get fresh, get fresh
(Word up!)

[Verse 1 - Vado]
Doors closing, hoes be foreclosing
Pull up to the curb, drop head, 2-door Rollsing
Dior posing, couldn’t be more chosen
If not, make sure you Warn a Brother, Lyor Cohen
Bruce Bowen, tight D, right V
Get fresh, cold, we go hard like Mike B
The thirteens white and red my mic’s be
(Check em out, check em out, check em out)
Uhh, check em out, a gold? check em out
Wear what you wanna wear
If you don’t care let em out
He ain't even have to prepare
Coulda swear, suited out
Nautica with the zipper
The construct boot it out
Uh, you know I stay booted out
Never dress too cute if I may shoot it out
Get you a few sets, tooly in the Louie pouch
(Get fresh, get fresh, get fresh)

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
There’s a reason they ain’t wearing these, high
Cause it’s only one pair of these
Watch where you step try and take care of these
You can tell how i’m dressed, I’m a rare breed
D boy fresh still hard though, 40 belows on
Wool cargos, brand new, but I got them last year
And my hoody is 100% cashmere, ah
When you see me you think dollars
Persian lamb, mink collars
If it ain’t the retros it’s high top air force one, ‘Sheed Wallace
Thou shall judge but not hate me
Polo Mansion, not Macy’s
I see these boys gonna make me
(get fresh, get fresh, get fresh)

[Verse 3 - Ludacris]
I stay fresh from my head to my toe nails
Mink on my back, bitch riding on my coat-tail
Shell shock from my shell toe Adidas
And I got so many furs I done pissed off PETA
Two seater, all white coupes, diamonds are one of a kind
That’s an all white suit, get it?
Three piece like chicken
(Check em out, check em out, check em out)
Top billin, what more can I say
God dammit I’m stuntin
Fresher than a blueberry muffin, hoes love it
And when they drop the new J’s I’m on it
You'd swear I had Michael Jordan living in my closet
I dunk on you niggas like a donut
Sure enough, your clothes ain't fly and you make me wanna throw up
And I’m a down south pimp in the flesh ’cause I…
(get fresh, get fresh, get fresh)
