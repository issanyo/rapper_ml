If you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Long days half sober nights
Unsigned performing at every open mic
God is all I needed to believe in me
Haters I tuned them out they were on another frequency
My momma never winded my decision
And all the bright lights never blinded out my vision
Music was my passion and my first crush
I'm just tryna ride the waves baby surfs up
When I'm down music gets me worked up
Plus in all my shows it gets women to pull they skirts up
What can I say I'm turnt up
I'm on fire these other rappers is burnt up

[Hook: Usher]
If you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah what an imagination
I'm a dreamer losing my concentration
Head in the clouds to trace my observations
Just connect the dots to all of the constellations
Looking for signs that's astrological
And I don't dream big my dreams are astronomical
So when critics write articles of my chronicles
I wonder if my hunger is felt in they abdominals
Hiding from life daily distractions
Where thoughts become things from the power of attraction
And I'm attracted to money and beautiful women
Ha and toasting to new beginnings, yeah

[Hook: Usher]
If you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Look its not long til the fights over
The turbulence is non stop till the flights over
So when passengers panic just stay silent
And realize its never too late to become the pilot
I fly higher take control of my destiny
The first step I needed me to invest in me
Its still an every day struggle for wealth
I'd rather struggle to working for me than working for someone else
And I'm steady tryna ease the stress
So I open up all the doors with the key to success
If it hasn't been done then I'mma do it first
Cuz I'm the master of the Ludaverse

[Hook: Usher]
If you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long
And not long
