Here's another one, yeah another one
Dre and Vidal
Ciara
Shonuff

[Ciara]
This is where they stay crunk, throw it up, dubs on tha cadillac
White tees, Nikes, gangstas don't know how to act
Adamsville, Bankhead, College Park, Carver Homes
Hummers floatin on chrome
Chokin on that home-grown

[Bridge]
They got the southern cookin, they got them fellas lookin
Thinkin I was easy I can see it
That's when i say no, what for?
Shawty can't handle this, Ciara got that fire like

[Chorus]
Oh
Round here we ridin slow
We keep it gutta , you should know
Gettin crunk up in the club, we gets low
Oh
Oh (oh)
All ma ladies to da floor
Handle it, ladies back it up
Gettin crunk up in tha club, we gets low
Oh
[Ciara]
Ready? Take a new whip, paint strip, into a bowlin ball
Still smoke, hundred-spoke, wood grain armor all
Light skinned, thick chicks
Fellas call em red bones
Close cuts, braids long, gangstas love em all

[Bridge]
They got the southern cookin, they got them fellas lookin
Wishin I was easy I can see it
That's when I say no, what for?
Shawty can't handle this, Ciara got that fire like

[Chorus]
Oh (oh oh oh)
Round here we ridin slow (we ride it slow, oh oh)
We keep it gutta you should know (you should know)
Gettin crunk up in tha club, we gets low (get low)
Oh (oh ohhh)
Oh (oh)
All my ladies to the floor
Handle it, ladies back it up (back it up)
Gettin crunk off in tha club (in tha club), we gets low (get low)
Oh (oh oo oh oh ooohh)
[Ludacris]
Southern Style, get wild, old skools comin
Down in a different color whip, whip, whip
Picture perfect, you might wanna take a flick, flick, flick, flick, flick
Call up Jazze, tell him pop the bottles, cuz we got another hit, hit, hit
Wanna go platinum, I'm who you should get, get, get, get, get
Ludacris on the track, get back trick, switch on the lac, I'm flexin steel
Same price everytime, hot song, jumped on cuz Ciara got sex appeal
And I keep the meanest, cleanest, baddest, spinnin on stainless wheels
Could care less about your genius, I bump yo status, I keep the stainless steel
Trunk rattlin, what's happenin, huh? I dont even think I even need ta speed
Bass Travelin, Face cracklin, huh? Turn it up and make the speakas bleed
Dirty south, we ballin dawg, and never think about fallin dawg
Ghetto harmonizing, surprising, runnin back cuz tha song is called
[Ciara]
Oh
Round here we ridin slow
We keep it gutta you should know
Gettin crunk up in tha club, we gets low
Oh
Oh
All ma ladies to tha floor
Handle it, ladies back it up
Gettin crunk off in tha club, we gets low
Oh
Oh
Round here we ridin slow
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin crunk up in tha club,we gets low
Oh
Oh
All ma ladies to tha floor
Handle it, ladies back it up
Gettin crunk off in tha club, we gets low
Oh
