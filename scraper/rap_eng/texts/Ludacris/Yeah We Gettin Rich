[Intro]
Yeah we gettin rich
Yeah we gettin rich
Yeah we gettin rich, I said
Yeah we gettin rich, bitch my whole crew eating
Yeah we gettin rich, bitch my whole crew eating


[Verse 1: Tity Boi]
It's Tity Boi, you know my demeanor
24 inches on the Beamer, mine cleaner
Had a baby daddy saying man have you seen her
And the nigga saying "yeah she with the nigga with the Beamer
ATL finest, south side behind this
My new nickname is Your Highness I'm the flyest
I'm the brightest, I got the Midas touch
Anything I touch I can bundle up and double up
Switch lanes calm as fuck
I ride around with money like an armored truck
Wells Fargo, where's Harbo?
Color purple, move weight like cargo
And yeah I need cheese like nacho
ASAP, pronto, this feeling is winning
Cinco de Mayo, my connect just chilling
But every other day I swear just like Christmas
We got bags like Santa Claus, keys like piano, dawg
When Hard came out he came out Muslim
When Gold came out man, he came out jookin
The life we chose hoes, clothes, dope, doe
That's all a nigga know, yep


[Hook]
Yeah we getting rich bitch
My whole crew eating
Yeah we getting rich bitch
My whole crew eating
Yeah we getting rich bitch
My whole crew eating
Yeah we getting rich
Yeah we getting rich
Yeah we getting rich bitch
My whole crew eating
Yeah we getting rich bitch
My whole crew eating


[Verse 2: Dolla Boy]
Can't be fucking with you niggas while I'm dealing with these bricks
That's the same shit that broke Michael Vick
Shit happens, pick your best rapper in a battle
Don't know enough
Don't play with kids come back when you grown up
Grown man shit, this is not Nickelodeon
You wanna see a trick I can show you where I'm holdin em
Trapper of the Year, the connect call me
Say the pack in the air I got the check on me
You boys been phoney talking bout what you holding
Niggas bullshitting rapping boy, keep at least 2 on me
Twin like fish in the suits saying who want em
Trying to switch the page, today the coupes grey
Tomorrow then it's beige, the next day it's orange
While I'm sparring back and forth with a bitch that's foreign
Taking off the glasses, smoking weed and laughing
Time for some action, face in my lap bitch
Just like Tit said
I think about money I got chickens on my head and your bitch in my bed


[Hook]


[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Disturbing tha Peace
Luda!
Listen
How else can I explain it?
Young, black and famous
I shit dollar bills, I get money out the anus
I own 12 houses, niggas still paying rent
I tipped the maid 5 stacks and I ain't seen the bitch since
Too much money, I don't know how to act with it
So I ride around up in my 93 Ac with it
Like it never happened, like I'm undercover
Like women still licking my dick when I was Chris Lova
What the fuck, death to you haters
I wear black everyday like I shop with Darth Vader
Keep the Luke Skywalker force is the chopper
Furry mink coat straight looking like Chewbacca
You can't stop us, even if you tried
Closet looking like some gaters just crawled in and died
And we have gathered here today for the mulah
Rich niggas, Dolla Boy, Tity Boi, Luda!
