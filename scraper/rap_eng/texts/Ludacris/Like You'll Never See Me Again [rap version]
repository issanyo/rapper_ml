[Intro: Ludacris]
Remix (AK)
Remix (Ludacrew)
Remix (Woo!)
Every time, every time, I see you, I see you
I say, say
That tomorrow, that tomorrow's, never promised
Today, day
Every time, every time, I see you, I see you
I say, say
That tomorrow, that tomorrow's, never promised
Today, day

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was it everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
Cause Lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh Oh Ohhhhh

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Luda
Every time I see you I squeeze you like you my teddy bear baby
Got ya hand on the wheel and ya peddle to the metal
Pretty woman you drive me crazy
Got you by my side and I really can admit that I never thought you would go
I might of did my thang on the side with some chick but I never thought you would know
What was I thinking I must have been drinking trying bring that drama
Hanging out at all times of the night with the fellas and disappear just like Osama
Running like Obama, I'm a liar I should've been ashamed
Playing it like the station this is just real life this is not a game
And I'm insane for ya
I feel the pain for ya
Stand all under my umbrella
I'll shield the rain for ya
Drop Drop drip-drip shed a tear
Cause I'm right here and I'm a lick it off
Tock Tock tick-tick the clock goes
Unbutton your clothes and I'm a get em off
Get it off real quick Get it off real quick
Ludacris let me make it up to ya
Every time we hug we kiss we touch
Makes me wanna make love to ya
I'm a rock your world you rock my world
You make my every-day
Ludacris and Alicia keys and I'm a make ya say

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again (Can you do that for me baby?)
Every time you touch me (See we don't really know)
Touch me like this is the last time (See everyday we never know)
Promise that you'll love me (I want you to promise me)
Love me like you'll never see me again (Like you'll never see me again)
Oh Oh Ohhhhh

[Outro: Ludacris]
Every time, every time, I see you, I see you
I say, say
That tomorrow, that tomorrow's, never promised
Today, day
Every time, every time, I see you, I see you
I say, say
That tomorrow, that tomorrow's, never promised
Today, day
Every time, every time, I see you, I see you
I say, say
That tomorrow, that tomorrow's, never promised
Today, day
