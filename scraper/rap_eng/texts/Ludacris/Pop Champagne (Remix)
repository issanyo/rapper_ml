[Verse 2: Lil' Kim] (Ron Browz)
Lil' Kim in the buildin you know it's goin down
Only thing besides money bring the dope boys out
And I ain't even gotta bring my purses out
When I'm with my dope boys everything is on the house
(OHHHHHHHH!!!!!) Pop champagne!
(OHHHHHHHH!!!!!) Pop champagne!
(OHHHHHHHH!!!!!) We pop champagne!
(OHHHHHHHH!!!!!) We pop champagne!
I feel like strippin while I'm dancin on the couch
Boys throwin money at me while they grabbin on there crotch
I'm holdin that bottle like an Ace Of Spades model
Champagne in my veins even put it in my douche bottle
This Rose' got me wantin to freak out
He sweatin crazy like he pullin the sheets out
Red flag turn his spouse in the deep south
Them jeans want it so I keep hittin the streets off
Pop champagne like it's my middle name
Drive the champagne range
What we can't get we import it in the plane
We hot, so I keep the ice in the chain
Just incase the bottles ain't cold enough
I take it off my neck and then I drop it in the cup
Horny bitches wanna fuck
So put your glass up
Come out in the crowd and toast with Queen Bee and your boy Ron Browz

[Chorus: Ron Browz] (Swizz Beatz)
How we ball in the club I know you hate it (HANDS UP! HANDS UP!)
Mami dancin on the floor all like she naked (HANDS UP! HANDS UP!)
When she lay down with you I know she fake it (HANDS UP! HANDS UP!)
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it (HANDS UP! HANDS UP!)
OHHHHHHHH!!!!! Pop champagne! (OH!)
OHHHHHHHH!!!!! Pop champagne! (OH!)
OHHHHHHHH!!!!! We pop champagne! (OH!)
OHHHHHHHH!!!!! We pop champagne! (OH!)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I made the Forbes list yeah I know you seen it
Eight figures so if I say it you know I mean it
Every verse is fishscale I tripple beam it
Then I freeze my hand up and pinky ring it
Went from nobody on the block to superstardom
I got women from Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Harlem
Hit my crib on the Hudson only if your worthy
I put three on there backs like a Iverson jersey
LUDA!!! HA HA HA!!! I pop champagne!!!
Girls I really love it how you pop that thang!!!
Tell the DJ to never stop that thang!!!
So you could back it up and just drop that thang!!!
ROCK THAT THANG!!! LOCK THAT THANG!!!
MAN NOT EVEN PATRICK, WILLIS CAN BLOCK THAT THANG!!!
GOT MY BALLS AND MY BAT WHEN I COP THAT THANG!!!!
TAKE IT TO HOMEBASE AND I SOCK THAT THANG!!!
