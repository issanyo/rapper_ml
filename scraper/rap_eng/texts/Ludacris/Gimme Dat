Ludaaa... Ching-a-ling
I gotta car full of women, and a truck full of beef
Air full of smoke, le box full of heat
Heat it and repeat it every day!
If the cops seein on my bumber every thing is ok
What you say, we cruise down the block, drools on my watch
Fools on my truck, so turn this tuuune up a notch
Cause my whip game's propper, bentley drop topper
Clubs on Ludaa, drinks on Chaka
I'mma mash that woman, smash that woman
Jump, shot, fake and pass that woman
Over to Bobby V., and tell her to swallow he!
(OOOPS DID I SAY THAT??) good oh golly me
Cause it's probably 3 more women in tha cut
Talkin bout tonight, they tryna get FUCKED UP!!!!
And who tha hell would I be if I ain't grant them they wish?
Well sure as hell's not Ludacris
(WHOOOO! OHHHH! OKAY!)
