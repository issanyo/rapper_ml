Man, I tell a hoe to go to sleep, go to sleep
They turn around and frown, gotta make 'em six feet deep
'Cause we knock 'em unconscious with that nonsense
Read in between that fine print, think about lyrical content
Then about where your time spent
Mess around get your guys hit, a ten hut
I send three-six ol' sheeyit, nigga what?
If ya tired, ya tired, if ya snooze ya lose
But you won't wrap up ya bandages or hell you would
Nigga I got shotty's and semi's, I love 'dro and Henne' [Incomprehensible]
All brown and skinny but I've fucked up so many
I got QP's and halves, if we beefin' I blast
You sleepin' I laugh, ask Tit, I'm off the rip
I had this hoe who talked too much, I had to off the bitch
2-0, Mister Crayola, niggas know what I mean?
'Cause I slang brown, white, yellow, purple and green
And all you faggot-muthafuckas gotta know the routine
Go to sleep, hoe

Bitch it's me again, kickin' in your fuckin' doors
I look for dividends, I ain't lookin' for you hoes
You bitch can't comprehend, let me put one in ya bro
Let me put one in ya bro, so you niggas can go to sleep
So, lay down bitch, gimme all that you dreamed for
Gimme fancy cars, gimme bling, bling, bling, boi
It don't mean a thing, boi, for me that ain't gon' swing, boi
Them god damn toys, do you know what I mean, boi?
Now if you warrin' and runnin' from them three-six niggas
This forty-five gon' give a reason to sleep, nigga
Or bustin' massive 'round some S.K
My last trip to A T L I fucked yo' cascade
I'm strippin' bitches and I'ma ball fucker with a limp
They call me infer-stripper, sexy, red hoe's pimp
And quick to sink her on the nigga 'cause this what it's 'bout
We rob that trick and stick his dick off in his fuckin' mouth
We Memphis niggas

North, north, south, south, Westwood, Orange Mound
Nigga we be smokin' lite, never Cha Cha Charlie Brown
Memphis niggas in this bitch, pockets full, ya know we bail
Hooked up with my nigga 'Cris, then we head to A T L
Playas wild, throwin' bows, tellin' chickens, "Fuck you hoe"
Niggas rollin' optimo, snortin' that white shit up they nose
Mayne this town is like my town, so we stayed and hung around
Juicy J be high as fuck, catch me in the lost and found
Better use common sense checkin' me out for bitch I can stand for
And up, get yaself in this clique
Without my tongue licks, behind me gettin' handcuffed by a slut
Look, I'm from Gittero what?
Southside niggas throw it up when it's time to get buck
Niggas in the back of the club postin' up
Waitin' for a nigga that's new to make it up
As in, ain't no askin'; it's no tolerance as long bitch check in
She wit' me, comments will only get'chu basically eternally resting
So abide by the code of the streets
If ya got a bitch better keep her on a leash
'Cuz Lil' Fate gonna creep in ya home while you gone
Have you comin' back findin' nut on yo' sheets
