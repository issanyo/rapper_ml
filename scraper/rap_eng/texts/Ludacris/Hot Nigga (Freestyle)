Excuse my absence
People been out here burnin' bridges
It seems I gotta remind you motherfuckers who I am
You know what they call me, Luda
Have some more fun with these niggas, man
Let's go

Yeah, in Atlanta, been that hot nigga
On my second term like Barack, nigga
Lyrical abuse when I'm in the booth
Treat them like the NFL, how I drop niggas
I put 'em on the exempt list
Take 'em off the track
If they ain't earned it, that's pimp shit
Multi-colored bracelets on my wrist, no friendships
Yeah, I have relations with your bitch, no kinship
Luda, back at it like a better me
I'm just try'na earn my stripes like a referee
Call a foul on the play, you's a ho-nigga
Sellin' records, you can't even sell an O, nigga
And I'm smokin' on that knockout
New school niggas missin' credits like they dropped out
And I'm just takin' pictures 'til these bitches all cropped out
And only trace left is their bodies bein' chalked out
Then it's time to bring the drops out
Woman face down, you can say I'm gettin' topped out
Def Jam, should I opt out?
Two albums left, Flavor Flav, time to clock out
Fight the power
