[DJ Premier scratches]

[Luda] I'm the MVP, I'm stupid with this rap shit!

[Hook: Ludacris w/ DJ Premier scratches]
"Here I am"
"I'm the man" "Word!"
'DTP's about that bomb shit!"
"LUDA!"

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
When Premier puts the needle on the record then I put it on blast
Your flow's garbage, I throw it in the trash
I'm the MVP, I'm stupid with this rap shit
Rewind the verse, make the track do a back flip
Your speakers poppin on a handstand
They sneak dissin niggas, throwin little jabs like Bam Bam
But I'm a bad man, they amateurs like at Apollo
I wipe em off the stage like Sandman
God damn man, what the hell you smokin on?
It's Ludacris, I got more cheese than provolone
And the chrome is home, so I'm never home alone
And only keep friends with two X chromosomes
So I command all these rappers, put the mic down
Throw a grenade in your mouth, nigga bite down!
Because I'm back with Premo on the track
Takin it to the essence, showin niggas how to rap

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Still hungry as the day I began, I heat the booth up so much
The engineer caught a muthafuckin tan
I'm the truth when it comes to it (true!)
I hold hip-hop for hostage, since 2000, I put a gun to it
And I run through it, like a Jamaican Bolt
And everyday's a vacation on Jamaican smoke
Cloud your whole block, talk shit and hear the fo' pop
One, two and it don't stop
And my delivery's invadin your vicinity
Hennessey is my remedy, taking shots like Kennedy
And I been a G for a long time
To these streets, I'm connected like I'm online
On time for whatever
And every time an album drop, I drop BIG like Voletta
I'm ahead of the competition, they wishin that I just fade off
My career for your life, let's trade off

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Eight years in the game, ain't a damn thang changed
So I brought it back to one of the tracks
Of where the damn thang came
And he goin down in history, cause he don't sleep
And he the first southern rapper on a Premo beat
I ate the kick and the snare, the samples always taste fine
And I shoot a hot 16 from the baseline
I'm on point like CP3
And I'll be goin down in rap as the MVP

[Hook]
