[Verse 1]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time and I was like

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Verse 2]
Oh for you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I gotta play it cool, cause I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around and I'm like

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm 16, and I thought that you'd be mine
I used to tweet you and text you and call you and hit you on Facebook all the time
But but but now you're gone, so far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong, we were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favourite song, she was wrong, I am gone
I thought I loved her, never but no one above her
Yes she was my lover, but now until another like

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone
I'm gone
