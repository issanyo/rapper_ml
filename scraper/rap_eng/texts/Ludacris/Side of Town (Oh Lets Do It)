[Verse 1]

Ok, now fresh pair of J's on my feet
That's how I do it
If you scuff my J's then we gon' have to get into it
Stuff you with my right
And then I'll deck you with my other hand
And you might get a little hit
But I'll bounce back just like a rubberband BOW
All up in your motherfucking face
I'll bust your bottom lip, come get a motherfucking taste
These BG's see me on tv
And better not mistake me for no sucker (sucker)
Cuz' the .44 make em hit the flo'
Flowin semiautomatic make 'em run for cover, cover, cover
Cover your eyes and cover your mouth
When a grown man talkin'
I'm swaggin', I'm surfin'
Matter fact that's how I'm walkin'
Walking it out
But on the other hand I'm walking it in
When it comes to the pa-pa-paper
Drink Conjure straight
That means no cha-cha-cha-cha-chaser
Thats right conjure-conjure-conjure
No I don't drink no more vodka
So find me gettin slizzard
At the bar with Waka Flocka
Managed by Zulu, Chaka
Can't touch me like Osama
Other rappers need to cover their face up like Lady Gaga
