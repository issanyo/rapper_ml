[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
Why, Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Don't you see the grill
Candy on the frame
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
Why, Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Don't be pushin on my buttons
Wait a minute motherfucker

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Bout time niggas seen the real
Old school car with the grill
'Ghini doors, valet can't help you up out it
Top fell off and ain't shit I can do about it
Ride clean, every day's a holiday
Gettin paid, every day's a bottle day
And you ain't seen a pimp until you seen me on the corner
Last time your bitch chose me but I ain't want her
Get money, motherfuck fame
Tryna break a ho and make change
If you knew me from the ribbit then you knew that I was tippin
You's a motherfuckin liar if I ain't reppin' Mississippi
What you know about it
Krizzle still cold on em
My gift of gab came with a bow on it
So if you grind and you down for the smashing
So what you mean, what you mean, what you mean

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Don't you wanna rest off in this glass house
If I let you ride set that ass out
Don't play me like no trick that's just so overrated
All this superbassin' woofer quakin' got you motivated
Haters screamin favors never stopped me
Sucker motherfuckers never blocked me
Poppin trunk, droppin top as I beat the bass
If you don't know what KRIT mean by now then bitch you super late
Po' another fo' up to recuperate
If pimpin was a blood sport I kick it like a kumate
Working boppers on the field like it's 2 a day
Three a day, 4 a day, any day a pro say
Shake it for a player, let me see it
If you lookin' for a southern country bumpkin let me be it
You say you ridin' and you down for the smashin
So what you mean, what you mean, what you mean

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I knew a bitch named Mandy
She was a pink toe
She had a lisp so I asked her could she deepthroat
She said she never done it, she said she never tried
She sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin lie
I said baby don't you worry just get down on your knees
Cause some warm head will turn me up a couple degrees
So just throw your lips around this anaconda and squeeze
And you'll keep a nigga harder than some government cheese
I say all women are freaks they just need an excuse
Pretendin' they all tight when these bitches is loose
That's why I stay strapped up when I'm knocking the boots
And love that military pussy I just need some recruits (Troops!)
Salute a pimp, it's Luda pimp
Bad bitches join my team, ugly hoes exempt
After midnight don't play no motherfucking games
Cause if you do, all you gon' hear me say

[Hook]
