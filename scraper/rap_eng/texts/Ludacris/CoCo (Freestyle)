I say I, I say I'm counting paper 'til the day I rest
They say I'm spoiled, but I can't tell, 'cus everyday I stay fresh
I'm ripping open all the new bags
Keep popping off all these new tags
All up on my 3 piece two swag
Bitch gimme head like Doo Rags
With the new jag, with the roof back
This weed good, but my coupe bad
Shout out to all my old hoes, I'm rich now, bitch too bad
Should of loved me when I had hub-caps, now it's 21 inch Asanti rims
6 figure nigga, on the first check, before I signed the deal
Now I gotta grind, until I'm out of time
Put my name all on that dotted line
Another deal, get another grill
I shine all this, lil' out of mind
But I'll snatch your link like Deebo
Get yo ass jacked like Steve-O
Get high but I creep low
I'm number one on point, like D Rose
I'm in love with my fourth ho!
