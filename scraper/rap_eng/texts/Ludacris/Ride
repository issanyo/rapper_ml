[Interlude: Ciara and Ludacris]
Ciara, ahaa
Catch me in the mall, you know I buy it out
G5 plane, yeah I fly it out
Ass on the back look like ‘Lac sittin on 28s
No you can't get her if you ain't got plenty cake
ATL, Georgia, booties look like this size
23 waist, pretty face, thick thighs

[Verse 1: Ciara]
I can do it big, I can do it long
I can do it whenever or however you want
I can do it up and down, I can do circles
To him I'm a gymnast, this room is my circus

[Pre-Hook: Ciara]
I market it so good, they can't wait to try-uh-uh-uh-uy me
I work it so good, man these -- try to buy-uh-uh-uh-uy me

[Hook: Ciara]
They love the way I ride it, they love the way I ride it
They love the way I ride it, they love the way I ride the beat
How I ride the beat
I ride it, they love the way I ride it
They love the way I ride it, they love the way I ride the beat
Like a freak freak freak, uh

[Verse 2: Ciara]
And I won't stop, don't stop, get it, get it
I'mma pitch it down the middle baby, hit it, hit it
I do it too nice, and look good
Handle my business like a big girl should
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4
5 o'clock, 6 o'clock, baby give me more
Pick me up, pick me up, you are my Ducati
All up on your frame, baby say my name
Show you how to get 'em, show you to do it
Left hip, right hip, put your back into it

[Pre-Hook: Ciara]
I market it so good, they can't wait to try-uh-uh-uh-uy me
I work it so good, man these -- try to buy-uh-uh-uh-uy me

[Hook: Ciara and Ludacris]
He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it (I love the way you ride the beat baby)
He love the way I ride the beat (I love it)
Like a freak freak freak, uh

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
She ride it like a roller coaster: as soon as I get her to the top, she screams
I put her out like a light, she'll be out for the night, as soon as I hit her head hit the pillow, sweet dreams
Wake her up about 30 minutes later, calling me to tell me later, "Let's go again"
Red zone, I'ma get her first down, call me Luda Drew Brees, I throw it in
Touchdown, he scores; Ludacris the MVP
With a rack like that and a back like that, Cici, better see-see me
Cause them legs just keep on going, so I gotta put her to bed
Let the 808 thump and the beat go bump cause she ride it like a thoroughbred

[Hook: Ciara]
They love the way I ride it, they love the way I ride it
They love the way I ride it, they love the way I ride the beat
How I ride the beat
I ride it, they love the way I ride it
They love the way I ride it, they love the way I ride the beat
Like a freak freak freak, uh

[Ciara]
(Ooh ooh ooh) oh baby baby baby
Do you like it up, when I'm up
When I'm down, when I'm down
(Ooh ooh ooh) oh baby baby baby
He can't stand to look away while I'm whirlin' this around
(Ooh ooh ooh) oh baby baby
You like it, now take it up and down
(Ooh ooh ooh) oh baby
He love it when I twirl this thing all around

[Hook: Ciara]
He love the way I ride it, he love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it, he love the way I ride the beat
How I ride the beat
I ride it, they love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it, he love the way I ride the beat
Like a freak freak freak, uh

[Interlude: Ludacris]
Catch me in the mall, you know I buy it out
G5 plane](490975), yeah I fly it out
Ass on the back look like ‘Lac sittin on 28s
No you can't get her if you ain't got plenty cake
ATL, Georgia, booties look like this size
