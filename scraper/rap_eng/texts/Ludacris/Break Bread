[Intro: Bone Crusher] + (Ludacris)
I-20 nigga (Break bread nigga) Yeah
Don't get skull drug (break bread nigga) Fuck nigga

Tell 'em tell 'em (break bread nigga)

[Hook: Bone Crusher & Ludacris - repeat 2X]
Heyyyyy I'm a maniac
Go and tell the whole world Mr. Pain is back
So get them thangs out you betta lock up ya house
And tell the cops they let the animals out
Break bread nigga

[Verse 1]
I-20 Meet the Dealer cuz I'm out on bail
I broke free and I ain't never goin back to jail
ATL's eastside says I'm back from hell
Reintroduced to my connect and I got sacks to sell
Since I was young I broke bones usin sticks and stones
Puttin bruises on you losers lames leave me alone
I'll be servin it for certain til the day that I die
You got that reggie for the low I got that fire for the high
Niggas travelin when they rappin but I feel like they actin
And I ain't talkin bout vacation if I say that I'm packin
Hear that hunger in my voice and all the pain in my eyes
If this the only chance I get to you can bet I'mma ride
I got my back against the wall but my hand on my tool
Cuz niggas gotta give me somethin I got nothin to lose
A-Town's new ruler throw ya side in the sky
Yall niggas lovin how ya livin but I'm (distorted) ready to die

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You niggas settin up to get me better come wit that four
This 20 got magazines and I ain't talkin The Source
Mr. Pain'll change the game by the time I'mma reign
I catch a charge like a flagrant foul deep in the lane
Yall niggas know where y'all can find me see I'm deep in the south
Where niggas put away they Benz and pull they Chevrolet out
Yall niggas cakin on these broads spend a stack on that bitch
I'll throw that ho right out the VIP and throw some yak ('gnac) on that bitch
And as far as all this beefin y'all ain't worryin me
We the index so I'm body that's a story in me
If I say it then I meant it you can take it at that
Yall been eatin off these streets and now I'm takin it back
Yall won't see me sideways you get it live and direct
I-20 in the flesh I'm comin live from the Dec
DTP I represent it see I'm more than a star
And if I'm fuckin witcha club I'm buyin (distorted) more than the bar

[Hook]

[Bridge: Ludacris (Bone Crusher) - 4X]
Get back and putcha life on the line (tell em)
Get back and putcha life on the line
Break bread nigga

[Verse 3]
I-20 is the shorts I be still takin aim
I'm the blocks head coach bitch I'm teachin the game
So I'm servin like I'm Agassi Venus or Serena
I'm ridin wit a felony you duckin misdemeanors
And man I'm still hurtin and my mama's still workin
So I stay wit the glove and a mask like a servant
A-Town's new ruler throw ya side in the sky
Yall niggas lovin how ya livin and I'm (ready to die)

[Hook]

[Ending: Bone Crusher] + (Ludacris)
Tell 'em (break bread nigga)
Tell 'em what (break bread nigga)
Tell 'em (break bread nigga)
Say what (break bread nigga)
Get cha shit fucked up bitch nigga (break bread nigga)
