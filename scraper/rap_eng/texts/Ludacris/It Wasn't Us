[Chorus]
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that

[Verse 1]
Uh, you can get your whole crew, even niggas that owe you, and ain't paid you shit
You can drink some cold brews and throw on them old shoes and jump in the whip
You can come and find us, and be right behind us and insert the clip
You hear something go "clack" "clack" "clack", somebody went down, but it wasn't us
You can sell about two mil, get hooked with a good deal and start stackin' dough
You can ride your mobile, get 20 inch big wheels and collect some hoes
You can even start eatin' good and smokin' good but you pressin' your luck
And you say wha', somebody went bankrupt shit but it wasn't us

[Chorus]
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that

[Verse 2]
You can go to the drawing board and just start from scratch all over again clean
Or you can tell a bunch of officers that I'm the one to catch but my niggas are the police
You can try to blame me and even try to frame me but I'll make the bail
Now somebody's goin' to jail, shit, but it wasn't us
You do track after track, and your walls get plaque after plaque
CD's on rack after rack, no mo' sellin' sack after sack
You could've had that good life, good kids and a good wife, it was yours to earn
But the record stores gettin' returns, shit, but it wasn't us

[Chorus]
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that

[Verse 3]
You could be goin' on worldwide tours and see your face on every magazine
Or you can flip through channel after channel and see that ass on the TV screen
You can pay for expensive videos and have whole lot of big bootie hoes
But when the shit start comin' to a close, shit, but it wasn't us
You can use your back-up plan, and even call up your back-up man and start thinkin' quick
You can call up the back-up hoes, even call up the back-up pros and tell 'em to suck a dick
Then you tell just to get deez, then you tell 'em just to pay the fees and to pay their dues
Now they catchin' those STD's, shit, but it wasn't us

[Chorus]
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, shit like that
Maybe 'cause I get like that, kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, climb like that
'Cause the world is mine like that (yours like that) mine like that
