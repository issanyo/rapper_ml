[Intro: Ludacris] + (T.I.)
(Here we go!) Surprise nigga (hahaaaa!)
It was bound to happen sooner or later (Hahahahaha)
(They ain't ready for this)
History has been made; ATL, yeaaaaaah...

[Hook: Ludacris] + (T.I.) + {Woman}
Cause I got {big bank}, all these haters wanna grill me
(But fuck that I'm about my money if it kills me)
{Yeeeah baby!} (And I'm up to no good)
Ayyy I wish a motherfucker would
THIS THA A-TOWN, COME INTO MY HOOD
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would
HOUSTON, DALLAS COME INTO THEY HOOD
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I keep a fresh pair of Ones on my feet
And double deuces on the Chevy
3's company, the double 4's on my belly
5 hot amps speakers shake like jelly
So many wires in my trunk look like a bowl of spaghetti
Assault and batteries, but my trunk stay "Ever-ready"
Assault and battery if you scared you never ready
And yeah I went green, and 26's on the hybrid
Smoked so much green that I can't open up my eyelids
Wake up in London, go to sleep on Atlanta time
Still my paint got more candy then your valentine
For five mill, I bought a lake front crib
Bentley Car cover lookin' like a laced-front wig
Of course they hating cause they still riding the MARTA train
Re-name the yacht but put the plane in my daughters name
Now that's Karma, so call me Daddy Warbucks
If you got money, I got more bucks

[Hook: Ludacris] + (T.I.) + {Woman}
Cause I got {big bank}, all these haters wanna grill me
(But fuck that I'm about my money if it kills me)
{Yeeeah baby!} (And I'm up to no good)
Ayyy I wish a motherfucker would
NEW YORK & JERSEY COME INTO THEY HOOD
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would
L.A. & THE BAY COME INTO THEY HOOD
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
LUDA! I'm a freak like a scorpio
Custom hood scoops make the coupe look like Pinocchio
I'm rich bitch, I should drop cash
The inside of the Lac' look like a wood shop class
And these women gimme love like it's tennis time
So many shoes that my closet look like finish line
So many acres that my crib look like Bermuda
So many diamonds, the safe look like Kay Jewelers
That Spider about to drop, my team said, "Luda get it!"
Now 50 thou says that I'm the first nigga with it
First round draft pick, later for you imbeciles
The car is all black like it got traded to the Timberwolves
And I keep a little bit of that green up in the lining
But as the weather change, my weed adjust to different climates
(Okaaay) Green in the summer time, orange in the spring
Now it's black with that purp I call my whip the "Sac Kings"

[Hook: Ludacris] + (T.I.) + {Woman}
Cause I got {big bank}, all these haters wanna grill me
(But fuck that I'm about my money if it kills me)
{Yeeeah baby!} (And I'm up to no good)
Ayyy I wish a motherfucker would
CHI-TOWN AND DETROIT, COME INTO THEY HOOD
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would
D.C AND B-MORE, COME INTO THEY HOOD
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm fly enough to fly away, trouble I don't shy away
From it, I annihilate suckers in they driveway
In church on Sunday morning prayin' 'bout what happened Friday
But them the consequences for coming at pimpin' sideways
Nowadays guess it pays to change
In cahoots with corporations, making major change
With magnificent watches and amazing chains
Plush pad in Atlanta and L.A.'s the same
I'm balling til I'm bored with selections and assortments
Of automotives worth a small fortune, of course it's
The '72 Chevelle hardtop, '69 drop
60 karat piece; you can barely pay your lease, peep!
Dude wanna talk new school tell him go ahead
Drop-head double R-Maybachs and corner sales
Swag out the ass, stack cash to the hairline
Fuck another car, it's time to try and buy a airline

[Hook: Ludacris] + (T.I.) + {Woman}
Cause I got {big bank}, all these haters wanna grill me
(But fuck that I'm about my money if it kills me)
{Yeeeah baby!} (And I'm up to no good)
Ayyy I wish a motherfucker would
MIAMI TO ALABAMA, COME INTO THEY HOOD
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would
PHILLY TO BOSTON, COME INTO THEY HOOD
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would

[Outro: Ludacris - chopped and screwed]
ST. LOUIS TO TENNESSEE, COME INTO THEY HOOD
PHOENIX TO V.A., COME INTO THEY HOOD
OHIO AND INDIANA, COME INTO THEY HOOD
MISSISSIPPI AND CAROLINAS, COME INTO THEY HOOD
DUVAL AND LITTLE ROCK, COME INTO THEY HOOD
OKLAHOMA TO LOUISIANA, COME INTO THEY HOOD
