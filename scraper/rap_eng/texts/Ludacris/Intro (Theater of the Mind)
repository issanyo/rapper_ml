Shhh, they're about to start the movie

[Intro]
Hear ye, hear ye
Disturbing Tha Peace presents, "Theater of the Mind"
Get your popcorn, get your popcorn
You scoot over to the left a little bit
Single file line now
It's an extravagant event starring Ludacris
Please silence all cell phones
We're about to go on a ride!
Let the show beginnnnnn!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Lights, camera, annnnnd ACTION!
Take 6, Ludacris, it's nice to meet ya
Blow the smoke in the air 'til I blow out your brain
Turn it up until I blow out your speakers
Gotta keep them Tweeters tweakin
Gotta keep them woofers pumpin
Then I blow out one of these verses
Spit 'em in ya, got a million more comin
However you want it, I can give it but you gotta admit it
Other rappers talk it, try to walk it, Luda live it
Sign it and seal it, multi-mil' it, said it and did it
Then give me sixteen bars on another nigga's song
And you know that I'ma fuckin' kill it
Cause I'm the fuckin' realest, when it comes to this rappin' shit
Semi-automatic tongue when I spit another verse
Cock back, I'm packin' bitch
And I'm back and attackin' with album six
Tell them other niggas we see danger
Probably cause I got enough albums to fill yo' CD changer
Gotta buy my whole collection, gotta beat my whole selection
Hit your neighborhood record store
And you can get it in the smokin' section
Now that's a coke connection, these fiends are addicted to it
No guts no glory, so that's my story and I'm stickin' to it

[Outro]
That's my story and I'm stickin' to it
Here's my story and I'm stickin' to it
Here's my story and I'm stickin' to it
Here some stories and I'm stickin' to it
Annnnnd CUT! On a good gate we're movin' on
