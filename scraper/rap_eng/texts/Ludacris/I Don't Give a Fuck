[Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's that nigga you've been waiting on
Trynna get more information conversating debating and hating on
I need some pussy that I can take out my frustration's on
Or on a yacht so i can take bad bitches and take a vacation onnnnnnn

[Hook]
I'm faded, I'm smashed
I'm spending all this cash
Got bout five racks in my pocket
I don't really know how long it's gone last
Pour that drink all up in that cup
Throw all that stank in a blunt
Grab that chick with that butt
And guess what? I don't really give a fuck

[Verse 2]
Life is a puzzle that I'm trying to get together
Everyday trynna figure out what two women I can fit together
Ding ding let me get inside the ring because I think I got the prefect match
Don't be nervous come on outcha shell lets wait for the birds to hatch
Shoe fly shoe bitch now it's time for the birds to fly
Meanwhile this purple haze created a little purple sky
If you smoke that dirt don't be jealous of my maryjane
8 albums in motherfucker ain't a damn thing changed

[Hook]
I'm faded, I'm smashed
I'm spending all this cash
Got bout five racks in my pocket
I don't really know how long it's gone last
Pour that drink all up in that cup
Throw all that stank in that blunt
Grab that chick with that butt
And guess what? I don't really give a fuck

[Verse 3]
I done got rich and lost my damn mind
Plaques to plaques got a nigga celebrating all the damn time
LUDA!
Quit fooling around and get some work done
Naw, I'd rather go to magic and see a bitch work some
I think, I think I deserve it I'm in that guinness boook
Rappers throwing socks I throw them right back
Still got these nigga's shoooook
People see me in the movies and they think I went Hollywooood
Only difference is I'm popping a molly with a bunch of molly's and popping a molly is gooood
It does I mean it really does
Was that Luda in a Lamborghini, I mean it really was
Hurry up and get a picture on ya iPhone
Then turn around, bend over and let me get one on my phone
I got it, Im'a save the filter and send it off
Haters throw dirt I'm just so clean and a nigga just rinse em off
Since 99 I've been in go mode
And every time I see your bitch in the club she being ho mode
I press a button and the whole damn crib just going ho mode
And the crib dim the candles get lit and I pour some fucking drinks
Hey did Luda really fuck yo girl?
What the fuck yo thank!

[Hook]
I'm faded, I'm smashed
I'm spending all this cash
Got bout five racks in my pocket
I don't really know how long it's gone last
Pour that drink all up in that cup
Throw all that stank in a blunt
Grab that chick with that butt
And guess what? I don't really give a fuck
