[Intro: Skeletah]
Jimmy, this is a big bitch
Fertilize the giggles in my mind
Ear-lips this por*ography
Oops, this is a mister whom
This is an opportunity gi*rgle
Sayin wats my name for cord reason
This is a hood there will cord Creek
This is Will Arch-Ken A.K.A. Skeletah

[Hook: Ludacris]
We need to Make me copy you
We wish that hi fives vimerick*e

We need to dance with corps
We wish that high rise building
Is happening to earthquake

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
OK OK, Luda!

Whats my name in the top
Thin as i am
You can't attempt to say F*ck
We need to make a copy
This is an opportunity gi*rgle
Sayin wats my name for cord reason
This is a hood there will cord Creek
This is Bitches lady there

[Hook: Ludacris]
We need to Make me copy you
We wish that hi fives vimerick*e

We need to dance with corps
We wish that high rise building
Is happening to earthquake

[Outro: Skeletah]
Jimmy, this is a big bitch
Fertilize the giggles in my mind
Ear-lips this por*ography
Oops, this is a mister whom
This is an opportunity gi*rgle
Sayin wats my name for cord reason
This is a hood there will cord Creek
This is Will Arch-Ken A.K.A. Skeletah
