[Intro: Ludacris and (T.I.)]
Rich by popular demand (The wait is over homie)
Yes, it is! A-Town, connect!
(Know the city gon' feel this) Damn right!
Say Toot, I know you see me
('Cris!) What up, boy?
I know both our pops lookin at us
Wayne Bridges, what up? Let's go!
(Bbeingig Phil, we made this shit happen homie)
History in the makin'! (Momma I did it!)

[Hook: B.o.B.]
I used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa! (ohh!)
Because I'm sittin on top of the world! (the whole world)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, ay, ay)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Man, I remember, 'fore I say that, wait, let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaken for glorification
Now, I remember so vivid, me and my niggas was livin'
Sub-standard condition, still handling business
Still laughin' and trippin', still having the bitches
I'm rapping now, reminiscing, and goddamn it, we did it
From trappin', standin' & pitchin' with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splittin' it eight ways, flip it in eight days
Thought that wild and unruly was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yay', but most the paper we made
In all dimes, I ain't lyin, the pleasure was all mine
Had big work to move, but we served the small time
I always outshined the niggas with small minds
Who woulda thought we'd be arguably the greatest of all time
'Round here? we develop such a sound down here
Been duplicated often, still, can only be found here
Only listen to Gs, that other shit I don't hear
Shit, they so far in the rear, why would I even care?
I'm too busy a player, steering niggas careers
Been talkin 'bout it for years, and now we finally here

[Hook: B.o.B.]
I used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa! (ohh!)
Because I'm sittin on top of the world! (the whole world)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, ay, ay)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, yeah, yeah)

[Interlude (Over Hook): Ludacris]
Luda!
Hear my heart on this one!
True story!
Rest in peace, Wayne Bridges!

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
They say what goes up must come down, but I ain't reach my cruisin' altitude (nope!)
Take a look at what I did, but can you imagine what I'm about to do?
The places I'm 'bout to go and the money I'm 'bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said, look out for me
Exceeded expectations, even at Def Jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Cause I'm a self-made, nappy-headed rich nigga!
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week, 'cause I
Work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart to
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef, so that bread, he get it
Put 'em all in houses, cleaned up all of my friends' credit (true!)
And now they witnessed all the glitz and the glamour
Catch us eatin' at Straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Ordering Singaporean lobster, celebrating coming from nothing
To winning Grammys, and rappers winning Oscars, yeah
And they say rappers shouldn't act, nah, suckers
We see Samuel L. Jackson, like, "Wassup, motherfucker?!"

[Hook: B.o.B.]
I used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa! (ohh!)
Because I'm sittin on top of the world! (the whole world)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, ay, ay)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I know them haters don't stop plottin' and wishin' we fall
Cause I'm standin' on top lookin' down at it all
I know from down there to y'all, it seems like I got it all
Homie, I ain't get enough, we still tryin' to triple up
That's why we got StreetCred and Akoo building up
Say I'm doing too much, shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember sayin', "Damn, if I could just get to a million plus"
And now I'm like, "Shit, what the fuck is a million bucks?"
Tripled that on my bond thanks to Biggs and Run
But never mind what I been through, just look at what I become
All this shit I've avoided, what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma, just call her, I sold dope
And dropped out of school, seems that's all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle, now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimums, but not when the judge sentence 'em
Cousins in college, where you think they get tuition from?
Just from standin 'round wishin, huh?
And while you standing 'round lookin' dumb, I make it happen
Takin' action, over time, got damn good at it

[Hook: B.o.B]
I used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa! (ohh!)
Because I'm sittin on top of the world! (the whole world)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, ay, ay)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, yeah, yeah)
