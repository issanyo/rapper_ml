[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Luda! Ha! --- wrist
Frozen like Queen Elsa, nigga
Pinned her down, got your chick
In a full Nelson, nigga
I'm here to put in work
Otherwise my job is useless
Your women pretend they brainless
My women pretend they toothless
All a nigga wanna do is blow a couple hunnid
Thousand how that sound to ya
When you move in love you need
Someone that's always down for ya
They can make you feel comft-
Able and grant your every wish
Who you know go park his jet and
Have twenty bitches twerkin on the landin' strip
Me that's who! Cuban sticks in a
Jacuzzi tub like Scarface
Rappers be rentin' these houses in videos
Little do they know that's my place
That's payed up, you owe still
I need the cash in hand like dope deals
And I can give your girl everything
That put in my five-course meal
