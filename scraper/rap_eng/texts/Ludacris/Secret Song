I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can

(Two chainz)

[Verse 1: Tity Boi]
I am wearin' my sunglasses, I'm feelin' fantastic
I'm blowin' on that [?] watchin' a plasma, what have you
And shorty layin' in my lap, then she sit up in my lap
Tried to take my glasses off, I'm like, "Uh-uh-uh— none o' that"
[?] wit' a hun'ed packs [?] wit' a hun'ed stacks
I'm ridin' in a fancy car with twenty-somethin's ona that
Yeah you gotta honor that, cause you know we runnin' it
I'm a fuckin' soldier, that make my kid an army-brat
Ain't no need o' stallin', when you call, we ain't callin' back
Yeah we want that product, when we rob you we'll take all o' that
Yeah, my sunglasses on, it keep my face tucked
See, when her sunglasses on, yeah that's her make-up
With tinted frames on my eyelids look what I did
I drive with no gasoline like a hybrid
I'm high, bitch. I'm on it, ho
Seven-five-oh on two-eighty-five, peddle on the flo'
[?] in my [?], I fell in love with dough
It's all about that money, that's all you need to know
I can't explain it, I don't know what you drinkin'
See all I care about is pussy, weed, and Ben Franklins

(Aphilliates, nigga. Pay attention, biatch!)

I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can

(Tell these motherfuckers how I do it. Luda!)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I wear my sunglasses at night-time, never in my right mind
Pushin', peddlin' then movin' that gwop right through that pipeline
Money money's what I see an' money money's what I be in
Freshly dipped from head to toe, flew to Cabo just for the weekend
Bitch, that's just how I do it; Oh bitch, I get right to it
Sippin' on some Golden Grain, but my niggas we call it embalmin' fluid
Put a bomb in your mamma's house, put a bomb in your bitch's bed
Meanwhile over on the southside, Ludacris is gettin' head
I'm on that foolish shit, only got one life to live
I'm shootin' pool wi' Tit, only got five thou' to give
Till I stop tellin' Tit to rack 'em, then we shoot them dice 'n' clack 'em
Later on that night on the southside, we got some bitches and macked 'em
Right down to their bare-essentials, don't mess wit' 'em on their menstruals
Don't test us like that bitch — get a number two fuckin' pencil
You must be out your noggin, better make the right decision
I wear my sunglasses at night cause they got x-ray vision

I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can
