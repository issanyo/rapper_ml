[Intro]
Yeah!
We were always told growing up you have to strive to be the best
Always strive for success, and second place is not an option
That's what we were told
So no matter what came up in my life, I got through it
That was my motivation
And now nothing can stop us

We will never lose, never fear
Overcome all and persevere
We're the best and we're down to show it
Any place, anything, we will overthrow it
We will never lose, never fear
Overcome all and persevere
We're the best and we're down to show it

[Hook: Akshay Kumar]
At the top, never coming down
Shera di kaum Punjabi
Made it now, take a look around
Shera di kaum Punjabi
At the top, never coming down
Shera di kaum Punjabi
Made it now, take a look around
Shera di kaum Punjabi

[Verse 1: Akshay Kumar]
Jeet ja yeh kade na haare
Jung vich jad jande saare
Jeet ja yeh kade na haare
Jung veech jad jaande saare
Dushman de pehnde vaare khedan jad khel Punjabi

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
At the top and I'm never coming down
Always stayed focused, superstar bound
Always was the dopest, never got weak
Head to the sky and my ear to the streets
Foot on the gas, hands on the wheel
Gat on my lap cause I'm going for the kill
Drink for the nerves, smoke for the stress
But death to the haters and to hell with the rest
I done paid my dues, made my moves
Blow a hundred thou, walk a day in my shoes
Long time coming, long time gone
Ten years deep but I'm ten men strong
Never gave up I just won't lose
So many hits but I just won't bruise
Rappers just dying, I put them out their misery
It's Ludacris and I came to make history

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akshay Kumar]
Jitiye jad baazi laaiye
Aisi assi khed dikhaaiye
Jitiye jad baazi laaiye
Aisi assi khed dikhaaiye
Singha di shaan bataaiye
Khedan jad khel Punjabi

[Hook]

Shera di kaum Punjabi
Shera di kaum Punjabi
