Where people dont dance all they do is this
And after the original you know what it is

(This is the remix motherfuckers!)

Welcome to atlanta
Remix it had to go down
I got something else to tell you about the new mo-town
Well people dont visit, they move out here
And there ain't no tellin who you might see up in Lennox Square
I don't about you but I miss the freak nick
Cuz thats when my city used to be real sick
People from other cities used to drive for miles
Jus to come and get a taste of this A.T.L. style
Im tha MBP most ballinest player
Make my own moves, call me the mayor
Monday night you know things change from time
Magic city back lookin like '89
All my homies on tha south side up in the Ritz
Tuesday night Velvet Room (south side) same shit
Wednesday strokers I don't go no mo
Cuz they don't know how to treat you when you come through the door
Thursday was plush but we moved to fuel
And i be up in the booth drunk actin a fool
Friday night at kaiya they still got love
And the shark bar' be poppin likes its a night club
Saturday still off the heezy fo sheezy
You can find me up in one tweezy
Sunday gettin me some sleep please
Im on my way to get the deck to hit jazzy teens

(P.Diddy)
Hey yo I'm from New York man...I'm from New York
Where New York at(3x)

(P.Diddy)
Welcome to New York motherfuckas
Where we dont play and out of towners get got like every day
And a gangstas a gangsta in every way
Sittin on 22s
Thats what long money do
Now the dog on it
Diddy shine on it
Tell flex to run it back and drop a bomb on it
Sunday we laying low
And halo sippin criz and we straight
Monday we go to Bungalow 8
Tuesday im in Spar drunk doin the shake
And for the rest of the week we just follow the freaks
You can spot us out of town by the way that we walk
The way that we talk
Cocky the state of new york
Hot now
Top down
At the rucker game
New coupe no roof player whats my name
Now Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten
Up town, what now
Lets make it happen

(New York Motherfuckers, if you can make it here, you can make it
Anywhere. We still here, and we buildin 4 more new towers, motherfuckers!)

Home of back porches
Chucks and Armed Forces
Old school cars they trailblazin like Portland
The girls are the best like travis with fatt asses
I call them gimme girls they always tell me I can have it
All got habits

Fried 2 cats and Colts with automatics
St. Louis is the truth like Sojourner
Don't need a burner we learn from Ike Turner

Without permission from them St. Lunatiiiiiccccccssss

Ladies and gentlemen...we got tha big Snoop Dogg in the house tonight
He just came from off tour and he wanna tell
Y'all a little bit bout where he come from

(Snoop Dogg)
Palm trees, bad bitches, and wannabes
Old Gs like me eatin on pollyseeds
Now n laters, jelly beans, and wallabes
Real niggas from the Santa, hardly ever seen
Emotionally hurt sell a bird off the cizzo
Then wen we dip we hop then we swizzo
A lot of homies like to wear the pizzo
Hair longer than hers, show up fo our bizzo
Doggy Dizzle you no i like to bizzol
Like Kobe and Shaq, so take that
Long Beach is on the motherfuckin map
The city by the sea
R.I. P., JD u know about the L.B.C
My niggas luv to steal us
Cold hearted killaz
Real cap peellaz
Real niggas feel us
Ain't no squelaz
Lotta dope deallaz
Bang diggy dang dang dog pound gangsta crip gang
Yea we do the damn thang

Scoop up the cocaine
Enter the church house
To get a little work out
Smoke out

Now put your bank up
Its all on me
I got a scenery to stink up
Crank up the beat
Raise up the heat
Im throwing a block party on two one street
Fa sho

Jd and Ludacris switch off 6xs

Welcome to Atlanta remix hey

Big beats hit streets
See gangstas roaming
And partys dont stop till 8 in the morning
