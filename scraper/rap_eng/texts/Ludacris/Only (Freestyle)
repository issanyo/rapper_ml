[Verse]
I stick to the script like bubble gum, bitch, call me big league chew
Got a big body Benz and some big booty bitches
That’s what us niggas in the big leagues do
When I pull up at the lights tell your girl she better not look over
Or the bitch’ll start droolin’
We could handle it like a couple of gentlemen
Or get into some gangsta shit if she start choosin’
Ludacris you can call me Goldie
Mackin’ all in my blood, pimpin’ hereditary
First place, first class, first serve, first everything
All of you other niggas is secondary
Nothin’ to it but to do it I get a woman and break it down into pieces
She be bowing her head and be down on her knees so much
You would think she be talkin’ to Jesus
Amen, Hallelujah, good God! Preach!
When it come to a verse or a song
I’m an animal, matter fact I’m a muthafuckin’ beast
And I won’t stop til I get everybody in the industry to bow down
And these niggas want beef
So I’m tellin’ every rapper that Ludacris bout to chow down
I’m a OG in the southern part of America
Music bumpin’ up and down all in your stereo
You rappers is nothing but shit up in kitty litter
Pussy, I’m bout to bury ya
Airin’ ya out, carry ya out, carry about your business
Get smoked out and roll one
OG to another OG, “what’s up OG?” It takes one to know one
Ain’t put an album out in a minute
Been watching these rappers up in the D-League
Plus I’m still spendin’ money off my 1st, 2nd, 3rd
4th, 5th, 6th and 7th CDs
Oh, I lost count nigga, just a young playa from the south nigga
Every album went gold or platinum
So get some certified plaque and wash your mouth nigga, hold up
You weak rappers havin’ no luck, you showin’ in and showin’ out
And at your shows no one shows up
Meanwhile I’m doin’ donuts in a Lambourghini
I’m the master, bow down like [?]
But call me Leroy, cause I got that glow and you know that
Aw, bitin’ ass nigga get a hard ass verse
Somebody gon be like sound like Ludacris wrote that
