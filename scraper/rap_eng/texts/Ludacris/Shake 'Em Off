[Hook: Big KRIT]
All these broke niggas
These lames, these hoes and gold diggers
Gotta shake 'em like a motherfucker
Shake 'em like a motherfucker
Shake 'em like a motherfucker
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em like a motherfucker
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em like a motherfucker

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
These niggas out here trippin'
Hit the strip club, niggas ain't tippin'
I don't hang with them kind of motherfuckers
When you see me in the spot, we be clubbin'
Poppin' bottle after bottle with my kin'
I've been fucking with my people to the end
Get a Bentley, a Beamer and a Benz
Don't be playin' if you ain't tryna' win
These broke niggas, hoes and these lames
They fuckin' up the game
These hoe niggas, police and these lames
They fuckin' up the game - All these

[Hook: Big KRIT]
All these broke niggas

Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em like a motherfucker
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off

[Verse 2: K Camp]
These hoes flexin' on the pussy
Bought it off the lot and now they lookin'
Forgiatos on them damn exotics
It's ironic, I'm still blowing on that chronic
Move like sonic
It's a lot of bad bitches in the building
And they all want to fuck a G
Still remaining sucker free
Shoutout KRIT, he fuck with me
He be on that country shit
I be on that cool wave
Hunnids in a suitcase
Play the game like 2k
Nigga, fuck what you say
Clean like a new fade
Fresh like a school day
Ho', just play your part
Nigga, play your part
No he wasn't real, he been flexin' from the start
They call me Wave, aye

[Hook: Big KRIT]
All these broke niggas
These lames, these hoes and gold diggers
Gotta shake 'em like a motherfucker
Shake 'em like a motherfucker
Shake 'em like a motherfucker
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em like a motherfucker
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em like a motherfucker

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Now, phony bitches, get the hell off my phone
I'm sittin' on some millions, you still sittin' on chrome
Your bank account is crying cause it's missing all these commas
Seven series Beamer, still livin' with yo' mama
Ain't enough designer shades in the game for you to see
There'll never be a pimp type, light skin, player muthafucka like me
I'm a G, and I'm a tipper
We never smoke none of the same grades
Drank none of the same liquor
We're not fucking same bitches, not slapping the same asses
Eating the same foods or paying the same taxes
Driving the same cars or shop at the same places
When you bend yo' girl over she don't make the same faces
Motherfucker
