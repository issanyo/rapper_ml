[Verse]
Who woulda thought that uh
Ten years later I’d be goin’ just as hard as I was goin’ back then
Put $5,000 on the Blackjack table
Smack my girl on the butt, good luck I’m all in
The money’s callin’, pick up like 9-1-1 emergencies
To stay buyin’ weed that’s stronger than Hercules
Flex a muscle nobody’s touching my hustle
I’m ballin’ like I discovered Spalding
Swoosh, put two in the hoop
There’s only room for two in the coupe
A king with diamonds in this game like there’s two in the suit
Deal, I shuffle cards like I shuffle bars
No human growth hormone, I only muscle cars
For real, my Ferrari is Abu-Dhabi blue
Luda’s moved more crowds that a tsunami blew
Got rappers shakin’ like quakes in California
To learn how to kill a stage, just Google my show at Bonnaroo
