[R. Kelly]
Now when you hear the beep leave a message
Only way you can catch me, on the south side of town
With them things on the ground
Cause I'm ballin like Spalding, shootin dice like POOL
Plus in up in the club, for free cause I got PULL

I never buy drinks, for bitches
Unless this bitch my misses
Or this bitch is my mistress, giving me sexual healing

No time for love feelings (Whoa)
Don't tell me yall alone (Whoa)
This here like drug dealings
Get your kiss out and I'm gone

Seven hiaasen honeys piled up in the Bentley Coup
Chinese chicken heads, fella what you wann do
Man I'm tired of all these fake nigga type dudes
Chicks wanna rotate with these eight figga type dudes

I'm a fresh dude, white T and throw back dude
All white shoes...blue, yellow, red jewels
Money is like steroids, look at my mussels
And if the dance play out, its back to the hustle
Some say the albums commin out, it ain't gon sell
Debut at number 1...CLICK!

Woo
Now see I'm just a black man livin out a black mans dream
I went from Popeye's to eatin Flintstone wings
Pourin out alcohol, rollin up green
Playin X-Box on a 100-inch screen

Man its not a game, these dangs they not used ta
Takin private jets and flying to St. Louisa
And then we can sex till the break of dawn-N
Cause I love em tonight but don't respect em in the mornin

Oooh, I got million stash
Cause in god we trust, but other people pay cash
A man once told me, no guts no glory
So I got the beam attached to my twin Glock 40's

And all my X girlfriends, wipe your smile
Six cars and seven cribs, how yall like me now?
I had to turn off the ringer just to hear ya moan
But if its ya man, pick up the GOD damn phone
