[Verse 1]
Come join the rocks it's my drink night
So I'm ready to party, yeah get down
I'm a vip and we so elite now
Pick you up in a convertible, let's meet now
Anybody wanna rumble in the streets now
All the punks jump up to get beat down
Helluva night we going with no sleep no
Madcon and Ludacris, let's sing now

I can't believe my eyes, I'm jumped up surprise, oh my lord
You're anything that average, it's  in your eyes
I wonder who you are in, I lost control
I'm ready to come grab it
It's  I must take the chance
You  run of me, so I grab your hand
Baby let's ride, ride
Girl we riding through the sunset
I never realized, I never knew I had to, my lord
You got the guts and you my next chapter, realize
I know you wanna do,  look in your eyes
I rise a few feet, need to know
Cause I  you mean, you and I, I, I, I, i
Come on and go, I, I, I

And that incredible body I want it right now
Seeing you was such a beautiful sight now
