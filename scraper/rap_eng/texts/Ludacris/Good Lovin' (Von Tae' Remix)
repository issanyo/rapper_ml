[Chorus: Von Tae'/Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 1: Von Tae']
Lost the love of my life, felt like I lost my soul
Too busy chasing rainbows for a pot of gold
Thinking to myself, should I try to make it work?
Or should I make this nigga feel the same way that he made me hurt
Iâ€™m lonely, sittin' up at night crying tears
Blaming myself for everything that you did
Praying to God, that he would take this pain away
And from that day I promised I would never
Ever love a nigga like you again

[Chorus: Von Tae'/Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

(Chorus)
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me
