[Intro - Redman]
Uh huh
Uh huh
Turn the music up a lil bit
Uh huh

Where dem horns at?

Dun dun dun dun da-dunnn!

[Verse 1 - Redman]
I ain't a thug
But I do thug things, nigga
So hold me down
Forty round
Caliber spitter
That's how the shorty crown
Run wit gordy hounds for forty miles
Then ignore me now
Duck, Motown sent Barry Gordy found
Sorry clown!
Super future thug
12 shoe shoot ya through the rug
James Bond watch on my arm
Tellin' me move the truck
Who the fuck can fuck wit me? (No one no one)
Do a buck 50 (on the highway)
Wit ya woman head on my lap
Tryna keep up wit me
Gilla nigga, dog
Writing bombs in gorilla paws
Don't applause
I shit at seminars I ain't even draw
My God's my gun
Don't need 'em son, cerebral cock
Beetle size ammo
3 to 5 mammal we the guys
That'll shit in ya turf
That'll get in ya skirt
I love Alicia so I'ma give what a woman is worth
I heard them niggas go
*Buck buck bidda bluck*
Then hide 'em Inside of
My noggin is strange (*howl*)
When them dogs is ridin'
'Cause I'm a cheap fucker, block usher
Eat supper wit
Pack of wolves that act a fool
Blood on they upper lip
Need a nigga? I'm that nigga to call
Nigga to draw chainsaws
To the brawl
Cuttin' ya ligaments off (Yo)

[Chorus - Icadon]
'Ey yo we future future thugs
Nigga we bear the minerals
Two tares subliminal
These here is criminal
Don't be starin' at generals (future future thugs)
We swear at interviews
Switch gears up in the coupe
We future thugs!

'Ey yo we future future thugs
Nigga we bear the minerals
Two tares subliminal
These here is criminal
Don't be starin' at generals (future future thugs)
We swear at interviews (Where dem horns at?)
Switch gears up in the coupe (Dun dun dun dun da-dunnn!)
We future thugs!

[Verse 2 - Ghostface Killah]
('Ey yo what up, yo?)
Y'all bitch niggas playin' me real close
Steppin' on my Wally's but Iron Man walk wit steel toes
We used to rush arenas but now we just steal shows
My eagle attracting people
Look, it's made out of pure gold
Versace rose colorful lens
Matchin' my Timbs
Blacked out Benz
Stop frontin' 'cause we back out twins
It's Doc and Deini
NIgga go and cock the semi
Put a million in the hood
'Cause our blocks is needy
Jean jackets with graffiti
Rope chains with the Nefertiti charms
Sealin' the packages up with them greasy palms
The only way y'all can see me
Is if the TV's on
My reign unanimous
I got the belt and I'ma handle it
Blow you out like candlesticks
Microphone vandalist
Evangelist
Analyst and my style is not to be tampered with
Flows on some cancer sick
Horns I don't answer it
Them phone suits don't have all my money
Bet I will cancel it

[Chorus - Icadon]
'Ey yo we future future thugs
Nigga we bear the minerals
Two tares subliminal
These here is criminal
Don't be starin' at generals (future future thugs)
We swear at interviews
Switch gears up in the coupe
We future thugs!

'Ey yo we future future thugs
Nigga we bear the minerals
Two tares subliminal
These here is criminal
Don't be starin' at generals (future future thugs)
We swear at interviews (Where dem horns at?)
Switch gears up in the coupe (Dun dun dun dun da-dunnn!)
We future thugs!

[Verse 3 - Ludacris]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait up! Hold up! Hold up!
Without
Further ado let me get this show on the road
Future thug
Even my Kool-Aid jug's plated in gold
I'm faded and blowed
My life savings, made it in shows
And lost it on my way to Jerz, 'cause I paid it in tolls
So you can kiss my hairy bean bag
FUCK the nation
Just twist ya favorite titty nipples to my radio station
Because I say what I mean and do what I say
I had a mind of my own but weed blew it away
And now my lyrics got the parents all disgusted and heated
Because I'm nastier than airplane food and those that eat it
I'm never forgotten (Unh!)
Just rotten straight to the core
Up in ya telly with that wet towel up under the door
So need I say more?
I'm just your neighborhood whore
Wit Coronas and blunts
The size of some 4x4s
People claimin' that they comin' to my side of the South
But they ventriloquists and talkin' out the side of they mouth
So the bullets I'm slidin' 'em out
And the criminals hidin' em out
And they all wanna come in the hood and try to make good but a nigga's guidin' 'em out
So all these other phony rappers keep your head to the sky
Because I'm ruining it for everyone
They wish I'd just diiiieee (Where them horns at?)
(Dun dun dun dun da-dunnn!)
