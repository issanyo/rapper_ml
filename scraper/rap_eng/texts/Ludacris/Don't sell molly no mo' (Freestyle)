[Intro: Ludacris]
Yeah
Ha, new year, new album coming soon, yes
I got a lot more shit to say man...

[Verse: Ludacris]
Reviews is out and Burning Bridges EP got 'em  5 stars
So wake up if you sleepin', Luda got them 5 bars
Every week you ain't never seen a nigga drivin' less than 5 cars
Got money about of this world, bitch I'm tryna buy Mars
I told NASA build a spaceship and just fill that shit with cake
Pop that pussy on a hand stand but droppin' it out of space
Strippers floatin' on the ceiling, they don't even need a pole
Got 'em high up off that white, and I ain't even need a stove
I'm cooking heat for the 2015 and got that new album seekin' (Ludaversal!)
Pictures of me and my wife just got that internet geekin'
I ain't reachin', I'm just tryna tell you niggas how it goes
Welcome to my life as I explain it through my flows, here we go
I started out at 16 gettin' paper, Made myself made millionnaire
I ain't never gave a fuck about a hater
They sayin' Why is Luda always talking about his duckings? [?]
'Cuz rappers tend to forget and I gotta remind these motherfuckas
I'm a Boss, I'm a floss, I'm a talk about it every chance I get
Top 5, dead or alive I'm a show you niggas every time I spit
Y'all ain't never seen top flight nigga like me
I be on my jet in a three piece suit, no mo long white Tee's
I'm a hustler, I'm a true definition of a G
When you children grow up, then gon' be like me
So I'm livin' everyday and try to set the best example
And everyone of your favorite rapper's fuckin' head is on my mantle bitch, Biaatch !
