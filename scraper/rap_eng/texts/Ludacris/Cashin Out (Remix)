[Hook (Cash Out)]
Cool
36 O's so riding round with that nina
Riding with a ho named Keisha, smoking on Keisha
My diamonds talk for me they say "Hi, can I meet you"
G5, how high in the sky, ho I can't see you
Got a condo on my wrist girl, I'm cashing out
Got a condo around my neck girl, I'm cashing out
36 O's so I'm riding round with that nina
My diamonds talk for me they say "Hi, can I meet you"

[Verse 1 (Cash Out)]
I got Versace all on my back
These hoes all on my back
Plus these plugs all on my back
Cause they know I'm moving that pack
These Louies all in my face
Four-fifths stay up on my waist
Plus it ain't on me for nothing so please don't make me catch a case
Cause bitch I'm 'bout it
Me walking round with no check on me, psshh
Yeah I doubt it
Your girl ain't finna leave with me, psshh
Yeah I doubt it
And I'm like, what the hell they talking 'bout
And if I got it I bought it, cause boy you know I'm cashing out

[Hook]

[Verse 2 (Ludacris)]
Okay I've got ya whole estate up on my ear
Your life savings on my pinky
And oops I think I spent ya pension plan in Magic City
Got your bonus on my tooth
Your trust fund is in my hemi
And my girl just got her nipple pierced
With your tax return, on her titty
They say Luda, why you gotta write another verse about your cash
Cause I'm rich, bitch
And if you don't like it, kiss my ass
Plus there's too many rappers out here
Who be lyin' about what they have
So they hate a real nigga like me
Who truthfully stuntin' on they ass
Cause I, got the Georgia lottery in my bank account
Your diamonds are foogazi, you should take them out
Check the status of my life as a baller
As my money got bigger, all my chains got smaller
Motherfucker
