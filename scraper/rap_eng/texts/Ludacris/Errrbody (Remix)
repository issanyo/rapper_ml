[Bridge: Yo Gotti]
This shit here for errbody, errbody ...

[Hook: Yo Gotti (Lil Wayne)]
Errbody wanna be a dope boy
Errbody wanna be a coke boy, errbody gotta choppa
Errbody get money, errbody say they from the hood
Errbody real but they not boy
Err'bitch say that she a bad bitch
Errbody on Instagram lookin' like (I ain't got Instagram)
Errbody say they started from the bottom now they at the top

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Really had crack in the nineties's,really hid guns from my momma, nigga ask about me
Money, weed, pain pills, drank,four course meal, I got full off the appetizer, bitch
I really got shooters right beside me,really got groupies in the lobby, hoopin' and the holl'in'
And I really got bazookas with the silence,pointed right, at your medulla oblongata,Ramen noodles on your collar
I maneuver, like a cougar with the chopper,connoisseur, entrepreneur, pursuin' every dollar till I got 'em
Got a crew of niggas who will get it poppin', if it's poppin,'ya'll newer niggas ain't really poppin,', that's what's poppin'
Got a crew of bitches come to pussy poppin', that's what poppin',and we gone do it big, astronomic, catastrophic
Everybody said, that they fuckin' everybody, everybody sayin' that I'm fuckin' everybody
Lil Tune

Errbody wanna be a dope boy
Errbody wanna be a coke boy, errbody got a choppa
Errbody get money, errbody say they from the hood
Errbody real but they not boy
Err'bitch say that she a bad bitch
Errbody on Instagram lookin like they mad rich but they not
Errbody say they started from the bottom now they at the top

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Fuck that, we're still at the bottom!
Anybody get it,had to leave the streets, cause everybody snitchin'
Why these niggas marry strippers, when they everybody bitches?
My fault, that ain't everybody business, really got partners in the Feds
Really transition out the street, really, really got some bread
I'm a different type of nigga, I'ma play my position
I like different type of bitches, payin' mortgage and tuition
Why everybody tryna get likes, tryna get followers,and every bad bitch is a model
And everybody livin' pound blessed,#NiggaWeMadeIt, when everybody got problems
I know a lot of rappers dead broke, livin' off a note, waitin' for the label to say go
Fuck that, I'm independent, CMG still winnin'
I done pull up in the white Ferrari, Lam, Lamborghini, screamin'

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Errbody wanna be a dope boy
Errbody wanna be a coke boy, errbody got a choppa
Errbody get money, errbody say they from the hood
Errbody real but they not boy
Err'bitch say that she a bad bitch
Errbody on Instagram lookin like they mad rich but they not
Errbody say they started from the bottom now they at the top

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Everbody wanna say that they the best rapper on Earth
Too full of yourself, everyday ya'll suck, need a pat on the back, 'til ya'll burp
I've been gettin' money everyday, since before rappers started wearing these skirts
And your girl say my dick like a nine to five, so everyday I be puttin' in work
Everybody ain't built for the spotlight,everybody ain't got this watch
Everybody got 99 problems, but ain't got sacks like J.J. Watt
I smoke that Silverhaze, that Train Wreck, that Blueberry, that Blue Cheese
Thousand dollar belt around the waist, mothafucka, ya'll dragonfly, I'm Bruce Lee
While I was on the 4th, ya'll was on the 3rd,never slung a quarter, never slung a bird
But I kill any rapper sippin' lean, smokin' green, on a hot sixteen and that's my motherfuckin' word
Been gone too long, but I'm coming back around,so I'm guessin' everybody can't catch up
How we go from OG, to the Freshman class?Tell these niggas, I'm next up
