[Verse 1: LeToya Luckett]
Where do we go now?
Do we keep on walking into grey
Don't know now
But do we turn around, play it safe and take it slow now
I need to know now
Oh, I need to make sure that we
Know exactly where we need to be

[Pre-Chorus: LeToya Luckett]
And for the first time in a long time things ain't so clear
And as much as I wanna hold on, I know if we stay here
I'll never see my fairy tale, I'll just be another nightingale
If you never plan on setting sail, then why keep me here?

[Chorus: LeToya Luckett]
There's no way we can stay in the grey
We don't have to fall in love
If that ain't what you want, oh
But it's not okay for us to play in the grey
We don't have to fall in love
But I know what I want, ooh

[Verse 2: LeToya Luckett]
What do we do now?
The longer you lay in my arms, the harder I'll be to lose now
You try to resist but every kiss is making you wanna stay
If you don't ever wanna leave then, boy, it's all you have to say
Just tell me what to say, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: LeToya Luckett]
And for the first time in a long time things ain't so clear
And as much as I wanna hold on, I know if we stay here
I'll never see my fairy tale, I'll just be another nightingale
If you never plan on setting sail, then why keep me here? Oh, baby

[Chorus: LeToya Luckett]
There's no way we can stay in the grey, babe
We don't have to fall in love, oh
If that ain't what you want, oh
But it's not okay for us to play in the grey
We don't have to fall in love, we don't have to fall in love, no
But I know what I want, ooh

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I know exactly what I want
You out here playin, Luda
Listen, either you want it or you don't
Nobody got time to be playin' games as sure as the season change
You'll either be rich in love or go for broke
And life is too short to wastin' time and baby, you wastin' mine
You sinkin' and I'm just tryna stay afloat
I feel like at times you gettin' bored, we playin' a tug-o-war
And you the only one that's pullin' on the rope
We were in perfect harmony until you went off on a couple notes
And now I'm singin' to the tune of a sad song
You be the reason that we may not ever last long
You be leavin' me in the dark without the flash on
Get the picture? And I'm about to get my dash on so even quicker
Make up your mind, make up your time, pick up your face
Put it on the line, go put a clown, don't play it safe
It's inevitable, our feelings gon' get in the way
But on the way, we can't be playin' all up in the grey, hey

[Chorus: LeToya Luckett]
There's no way we can stay in the grey
We don't have to fall in love, oh no
If that ain't what you want, oh
But it's not okay for us to play in the grey
We don't have to fall in love
Ooh 'cause that ain't what I want
