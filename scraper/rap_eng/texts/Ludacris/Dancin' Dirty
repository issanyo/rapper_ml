[Intro: Ludacris]
Hey, leggo

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ludacris]
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
Dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
She with her friends, they model
They popping ass like they popping bottles
I'm with my niggas, we got dough
So bend that ass for this cash on the floor, leggo

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Shake it, shake it like you mean it (yeah)
You take another shot, me and your girl gon' double team it (hey!)
She drop it to the floor like I ain't even never seen it
And runnin' that dirty mouth like I ain't even tryna clean it
So I, grab a cup, fill it to the brim
Then hand you a nightcap and say, "We goin' for a swim" (hey!)
Later on at the cribbo, hard as a armadillo
She said she thinks she love me, so I told that bitch, "Ditto"
Fetchin' these Georgia peaches then let 'em ride off they leashes
They thinkin' I'm so facetious 'til I beat that pussy to pieces
I'm checkin' they facial features, they shakin' like some sort of seizure
And thinkin' I'm some sort of creature, ATLien, nice to meet ya, Luda

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ludacris]
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
Dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
She with her friends, they model
They popping ass like they popping bottles
I'm with my niggas, we got dough
So bend that ass for this cash on the floor, leggo

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Throw it, throw it like you know it (ooh!)
These girls be actin' shy but you just ain't afraid to show it (ha)
I got all this money and I'm damn sure finna blow it
'Cause she asked me for a drink and I'm damn sure finna pour it
I'ma, make it strong, she said she like it fruity
In another 30 minutes, I'll be feelin' on her booty (oh!)
An hour after that, I'll have her twisted like a cyclone
Legs wrapped around me 'til she squeeze me like a python
I call that slizzer, we both been gone off that liquor
She let down all her defenses and yes, I give her the business
With the quickness she came to her senses, while I'm tappin' and snappin' pictures
Relentless but so persistent, now she said it's just Ludacris' (woo!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ludacris]
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty
She dancing dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
Dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
She with her friends, they model
They popping ass like they popping bottles
I'm with my niggas, we got dough
So bend that ass for this cash on the floor, leggo

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Pop it, pop it like a stripper (stripper)
Pop it like a soda can, pop it for a Snicker
Pop it for these fast balls, throw it like a pitcher
When the waitress yellin', "Last call," drop it on a nigga, blaw
The stealth bomber, flew her to Punta Cana (ayy)
We sippin' on some coladas I'm takin' off her pyjamas
She nasty with a nice persona, she bitin' me like piranha
The modern day Jeffrey Dahmer, she must get it from her mama

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ludacris]
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty (yeah)
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty (yeah)
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty (yeah)
She dancing dirty, she dancing dirty (ooh)
She dancing dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
Dirty on the floor 'cause she know a nigga watching
She with her friends, they model (yeah)
They popping ass like they popping bottles (woah, woah, woah)
I'm with my niggas, we got dough (go, go)
So bend that ass for this cash on the floor, leggo (yeah, yeah, girl)
