Saturday, Saturday, S-S-S-Saturday, Saturday x2

Ludacris:

I got my cup filled up, all the way to the brim, brim, brim, brim
Black on black Cadillac with the custom trim, trim, trim, trim
Smoke fillin' up my lungs and I'm blowing blubble, blubble, bubble, blubbles
It's Saturday night, let's get in trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble

Jessica Mauboy:

So it's about to go down, me and my girls bout to run this town
So where we're planning to go, don't matter cause we gon' take control
Now we got the hair done, got the pink and whites
And we're off, gonna see what what the fellas are like
Got the top dropped down on the DB9
Pushing 90 on the freeway so we gon' make good time

Yeah we gon' ride, ride, ride, on a Saturday night
All the girls they just hatin' because they know we that tight
Bout to get it poppin, bout to take a spotlight
So we ride, we ride, on this Saturday night

We on, we on fire, we roll, we roll higher
We ride, we ride flyer then you, we ride, we ride X2

They goin' high heel shoes, me and my girls rocking Jimmy Choo's
They think that benzel's fun, we roll out like we're the girl James Bond
Now we got the hair done, got the pink and whites
And we're off, gonna see what what the fellas are like
Got the top dropped town on the DB9
Pushing 90 on the freeway so we gon' make good time

Yeah we gon' ride, ride, ride, on a Saturday night
All the girls they just hatin' because they know we that tight
Bout to get it poppin', bout to take a spotlight
So we ride, we ride, on this Saturday night

We on, we on fire, we roll, we roll higher
We ride, we ride flyer then you, we ride, we ride X2

Ludacris:

You see we ride, we go, and we, rock, we rollAnd we pop lock and I drop the top, I hit a swtitch and the wind go low
And my mission for tonight is just to get into some action
Wake up tomorrow morning and not even know what happened

Jessica Mauboy:

Yeah we gon' ride, ride, ride, on a Saturday night
All the girls they just hatin' because they know we that tight
Bout to get it poppin, bout to take a spotlight
So we ride, we ride, on this Saturday night

We on, we on fire, we roll, we roll higher
We ride, we ride flyer then you, we ride, we ride X2
