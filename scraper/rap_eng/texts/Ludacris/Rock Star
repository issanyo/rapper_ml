[Intro: Ludacris]
Lights, st-st-stamina, action
I'm a rock star, check the crowd reaction, I'm like
Lights, st-st-stamina, action
I'm a rock star, check the crowd reaction, I'm like

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Hey, you's a rock star, baby
Up in the building makin' the club go crazy
Hey, you's a rock star, baby
Throwing ass like that, you must be a rock star, baby

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda, hey
I'ma strung yo body your body like a guitar string
Stunting in Roberto Cavalli mami with the dime frame
Hotter than tamales, you probably should be my wild thang
Tell them other chicks to mind they business and let us do our thang
I gotcha open, you're open, stroking, now you're soaking wet
And I'm not from Texas but I hold 'em, rope 'em, and I yoke they neck
You gon' make a player choose, show me what that thang'll do
Class is in session, let me show you a thang or two
I'll strip ya, I'll strip ya down to your bare minimums
And I'll, I'll lick ya, I'll lick ya down, you taste like cinnamon
And I'll grab a little bit of that whipped cream
Then I'll put her on the back, get mean
Then I'll get her in a matrix, cut her like LASIK
Basically make her scream
At the top of her lungs, give her shortness of breath
How many times can you cum before I poke you to death?
Someone call in the ref, Ludacris is tired of playing
In the middle of the stage with an ass like that, you got everybody saying

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Hey, you's a rock star, baby
Up in the building making the club go crazy
Hey, you's a rock star baby
Throw an ass like that, you must be a rock star, baby
Say, I'm a rock star, baby
Fucking with this weed and Patron got me hazy
Hey, I'm a rock star, baby
So put 'em up if you's a rock star, baby

[Verse 2: R Kelly]
Girl, yo booty so swoll', how you got them jeans around it?
Girl, yo booty so swoll', why you think I'm singing about it?
Hit it hard from the back and then I go to sleep and dream about it
It's like that ass is crack the way you got me fiendin' about it
I'm telling you now, the way we fuck gon' lead to child birthing
Rocking to this guitar is about to have me crowd surfing
Kells'll put on a show up until the closed curtains
Then right after the show, backstage, ass hurtin'
Call me Scotty 'cause g-girl I'm 'bout to beam up
Once I get ya, get ya, I'm coming up out them D cups
Stroking it hard, stroking it hard while you go your legs up
Making ya, making ya sound like you got the hiccups
Know what you want 'cause I'm 'bout to give you what you need
Up in my room, you're screaming, "Hercules! Hercules!"
Man, get Kells and Luda on a track, a hit is guaranteed
Everybody on your feet, this is what your shirt should read

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Hey, you's a rock star baby
Up in the building making the club go crazy
Hey, you's a rock star baby
Throw an ass like that, you must be a rock star baby
Say, I'm a rock star baby
Fucking with this weed and Patron got me hazy
Hey, I'm a rock star baby
So put 'em up if you's a rock star baby

[Bridge: R. Kelly & Kid Rock]
I got my drink in my cup
I got my hands in the air
I'm 'bout to set this bitch off
Like I'm a rock star, baby
We out of this club
'Bout to hit the after party
All the ladies comin' with me
'Cause I'm a rock star, baby
So put your hands up
(So put your hands up, so put your hands up)
Everybody in the building, come on, bounce with me
If you's a rock star

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Hey, you's a rock star, baby
Up in the building making the club go crazy
Hey, you's a rock star, baby
Throw an ass like that, you must be a rock star, baby
Say, I'm a rock star, baby
Fucking with this weed and Patron got me hazy
Hey, I'm a rock star baby
So put 'em up if you's a rock star, baby

[Outro: Ludacris]
Lights, st-st-stamina, action
I'm a rock star, check the crowd reaction, I'm like
Lights, st-st-stamina, action
I'm a rock star, check the crowd reaction, I'm like
Lights, st-st-stamina, action
I'm a rock star, check the crowd reaction, I'm like
Lights, st-st-stamina, action
I'm a rock star, check the crowd reaction, I'm like
