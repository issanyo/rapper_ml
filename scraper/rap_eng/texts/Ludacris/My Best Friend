[Intro: Tyrese]
I’m a do everything in my strength to keep you near, let’s go
All the Many Days You were on my mind ( Here in My Life, Just You & I)
Visions of me with you, all the time
I do whatever put's the smile on my baby's face ( Here in My Life, Just You & I)
My best friend and you can never be replaced

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
I'm on that homicide, suicide, drama like Islamabad
Under God, going overboard like the Amistad
Ringing bells, it was 2012 back in ‘95
I made it out alive, now finally I've arrived
But still threw back to all my other blue black
People that's sticking to it like, mice to a glue trap
My work speak for itself so I don't interrupt
I am an expert, this is no beginners luck
If you denying the truth, then I don't give a fuck
Otherwise get your hands and your antennas up
As we go into our initial decent, I'm alive, but only fifty percent
I’m praying God give me the strength

[Hook: Main Event West]
It’s like somebody turned on the light
It’s like somebody started a fire, and I
Feel so alive... Finally I’ve realized that
I don't have to tell myself twice, I know
That you changed my whole life and if
I know there’s one thing that’s the truth
I know I’d be lost if I lost you

[Hook: Tyrese]
( Here in My Life, Just You & I)
What am I gonna do?
( Here in My Life, Just You & I)
My Best Friend, You can never be replaced

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
They say tomorrow’s not promised today
But today I promise If we don’t make our own way
Somebody’ll take it from us
Snatch it like rats to cheese
So, lord help me please cause I rather die
On my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I’m bulletproof
Cocking the Glock and aim and shoot
My future’s ever clear a 180 proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride
And drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreaming of better days dreaming of better pay
But we got our work cut out for us so we better pray
Pray to uphold the week, not for eternal sleep
But if I die I pray the lord my soul to keep

[Hook: Main Event West]
It’s like somebody turned on the light
It’s like somebody started a fire, and I
Feel so alive... Finally I’ve realized that
I don't have to tell myself twice, I know
That you changed my whole life and if
I know there’s one thing that’s the truth
I know I’d be lost if I lost you
