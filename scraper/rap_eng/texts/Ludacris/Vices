[Chorus]
Some people like to drink
Some people like to smoke
Some people overthink
Some people overdose
I'm just trying to get the nicest
Bottles on ices
Pull some all nighters
'Cause everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got

[Verse 1]
I popped a couple bottles
I took a couple shots
I done fucked a couple models
I done fucked a couple thots
But from Seattle to Atlanta
From Philly to the bay
The only loyal bitch I know
Is a loyal bitch named Tanqueray
She gets me right everytime
It ain't never no fussing or fighting
She said she'll always be mine
That's why I cuff her and wife her
Now that's through sickness and health
All the way 'til death do us part
Ever since I seen her on the shelf
I knew we'd always be together from the start
And she tell me when my cups half empty
I tell her when the bottles half full
And I can't get enough so don't tempt me
Sometimes she's chased with Red Bull
Sometimes I have to re-up
'Cause I want to be with her all the time
'Cause everybody's got vices
I just wanna come clean about mine

[Chorus]
Some people like to drink
Some people like to smoke
Some people overthink
Some people overdose
I'm just trying to get the nicest
Bottles on ices
Pull some all nighters
'Cause everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got

[Verse 2]
I rolled a couple fat ones
I Passed around the dank
I smashed a couple bad ones
I smashed a couple skanks
But from Cali to Carolina
New York to Tijuana
Only Mary that I know
Is a faithful hoe named marijuana
I be draped in all designer
Won't can't me in nothing less
Than a couple thousand dollars
Success will just make 'em swallow
Good sex will just make 'em holler
Good weed will just make it better
And ease the stress in my mind
As I continue to going and get this cheddar
Better roll it, lick it and then light it
Puff puff, pass that thing around
Everyday, I gets excited
'Cause this here, came from the ground
And it was put, on the earth to smoke it
I can't think, of a better time
To light it up and ask if I wanna hit it
'Cause I know that I can't decline
Luda

[Chorus]
Some people like to drink
Some people like to smoke
Some people overthink
Some people overdose
I'm just trying to get the nicest
Bottles on ice
Pull some all nighters
'Cause everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got

[Outro]
Worry 'bout your own fucking life
Worry 'bout your own fucking life
Worry 'bout your own fucking life
Worry 'bout your own fucking life
Stay the fuck up out of mine
Stay the fuck up out of mine
Stay the fuck up out of mine
Stay the fuck up out of mine
I'm aight bitch...
