[Verse]
Smoke somethin', yeah I desire another blunt
Get 'em lit and keep 'em fired like Donald Trump
Back of the 'Lac, ?slash? the trunk gotta dump-
Speakers on Hercules pockets on Professor Klump
Fuck y'all, I'm riding until the muffler drags
Slap a bitch silly put a milli in my duffle bag
Hustle back, growlin' like a wolf that's on Wall Street
Mink on my floorboards, ostrich on my car seats
And the steering wheel I paid a couple G's for it
Dashboard lookin' like a chopped down a tree for it
Lumberjack with tracks got yo girl on her back
Keep dimes with me like a nigga sellin sacks-
I'm trapped
In between a rock and a hard place
Smokin' a Cohiba in the tub like I'm Scarface
Me that's who, bitch I'm a renegade-
Old school Chevy breakin' speeds on the interstate
New school rappers spit a verse getting choked up
Backwards ass niggas takin' shots then they post up
Me I'm shooting threes from the N-C-double-A line
Burn like these niggas vampires in the daytime
Last Boy Scout last real nigga reppin'
What's three strikes to a third-time felon
?Nathan? all you rappers subliminal when you say thangs
Playing on these tracks and get hit by a freight train
