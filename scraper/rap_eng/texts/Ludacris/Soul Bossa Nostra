[Intro - Ludacris:]
Yes sir!
See, what we are about to do right now
Is pay tribute to a living legend
So I brought Naturally 7 with me to do it big
And I brought DTP's own Rudy Currence
And me, I go by the name of Ludacris, right?
And it’s a lot of people out there claiming that they're bosses...
But I'm here to let you know the true boss is back...
Let's go!

[Chorus - Naturally 7:]
It's the rebirth of true Soul Bossa Nostra
(He's back on the block)
The true soul boss is over
Better respect the roots, I hope you've taken notice
Because he's the... the Dude coming back with more hits
Mixing the old with a new feel, vocals too, to feel real
(Soul Bossa Nostra)
It’s the rebirth of true Soul Bossa Nostra
(He's back on the block)
The true soul boss is over
Better respect the roots, I hope you've taken notice
Because he's the... the dude coming back with more hits
Mixing the old with a new feel, vocals too, to feel real
(Soul Bossa Nostra)

[Verse - Ludacris:]
Yeah, Luda!
He keep a flock of PYT's with him
And they all exotic, erotic, come in groups of threes with 'em
Pimpin' all over the world and I really get it hot when I’m overseas with 'em
And when we're in Bel Air at the castle, I shoot the breeze with 'em
Publishing checks is coming even when he stay in bed
So we eating at the master table and we breaking bread
New artists steady bossin' up, but I tell them "Why bother?"
They can't come close to Ludacris and his Godfather:
That’s Quincy Jones, baby!

[Chorus - Naturally 7:]
It's the rebirth of true Soul Bossa Nostra
(He's back on the block)
The true soul boss is over
Better respect the roots, I hope you've taken notice
Because he's the... the Dude coming back with more hits
Mixing the old with a new feel, vocals too, to feel real
(Soul Bossa Nostra)
It's the rebirth of true Soul Bossa Nostra
(He's back on the block)
The true soul boss is over
Better respect the roots, I hope you've taken notice
Because he's the... the dude coming back with more hits
Mixing the old with a new feel, vocals too, to feel real
(Soul Bossa Nostra)

Keep it up with the Jones and (go try it now)
Just check the records, cause he's holding (the number one spot)
So let the groove set the mood and (don't try to stop it)
It's vocal play combined with the swing

[Verse - Rudy Currence:]
Bet you I can do it too
(Bossa Nova, Bossa Nova)
Now that Luda let me through
(Bossa taking over)
I-I'm here to bridge the gap between the old and new
(Cause I told you, cause I told you)
That I’m a Casanova
Quincy, p-put that (swing on it)
And I’m a put that ([?] on it)
Stay face, mean mugging 'em, hugging this track like uuuuhhhhhh
I’m gonna make it do what it do, yeah

[Chorus - Naturally 7:]
It's the rebirth of true Soul Bossa Nostra
(He's back on the block)
The true soul boss is over
Better respect the roots, I hope you've taken notice
Because he's the... the Dude coming back with more hits
Mixing the old with a new feel, vocals too, to feel real
(Soul Bossa Nostra)
It's the rebirth of true Soul Bossa Nostra
(He's back on the block)
The true soul boss is over
Better respect the roots, I hope you've taken notice
Because he's the... the dude coming back with more hits
Mixing the old with a new feel, vocals too, to feel real
(Soul Bossa Nostra)

Keep it up with the Jones and (go try it now)
Just check the records, cause he's holding (the number one spot)
So let the groove set the mood and (don't try to stop it)
It's vocal play combined with the swing
