[Part]
Knick, knack, patty, wack
Oh, where my kitty cat? Give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'til I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home?
I can make this show stop, soon as he hear this fo' pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A-N all the way down to yo' block
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance flo'
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Befo' you make it big, there's just one thang that I gotta know
