[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I make niggas eat dirt and fart dust
Then give you a eighty dollar gift certificate to Pussies "Я" Us
I eat the whole pie and leave nothing but the crust
So you can feel what it's like with instinct, but no guts
A sack with no nuts or a mack with no sluts
Give me a full-body massage, I still can't be touched
They call me Seymour Butz, 'cause I get more ass than most
They say I'm Next and got that Butta Love, and get Too Close
Follow the leader 'cause I'm meaner than abdullah oblongata
My Tribe's on more Quests than Midnight Marauders
It's all piña coladas, no cops and robbers
Taking trips back and forth from here to the Bahamas
I hump more than llamas, get rolled more than tires
If you say I'm not nice, then you's a motherfucking liar!
Entitled to your opinion, into the next millennium
So many Major Coinz that I thought I had Amil-ion

[Verse 2: 4-IZE]
Yo, I am going to blow up the Earth
With my Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator
Buddha be praised, you meditator
Drop Squad interrogator, 85 percent regulator
The Educator and the Almighty Creator, dedicator
The separator of fiction, I spark friction
Smoking "Hay" without the Crucial Confliction
4-Ize prescription, microphone, Jackie Stallone
Psychic prediction, Egyptian description
Of my physical, my flesh is weak and it's pitiful
Spiritual is hooked up to the invisible
Umbilical cord of my Lord, Kumbiya Devine Kah
Remove paper of tar from every cigar
I slap authority like Gabor, Zsa Zsa
Half Allah, Half Antichrist Superstar
Rocking the microphone with a hand like Dr. Claw
While I'm hitting trees harder than Sonny Bono
Double Dragon, mixed up with an Abobo
I kill villains in slow-mo for talking crazy in my dojo
Got nothing to lose, like I'm a boxcar hobo
When I get Ludacris with Bridges on the promo
Niggas wanna clown, I'm Homey and Bozo
'Cause in the Grand Prize Game, my Life Calling like Jo Jo
The name sticks like pogo
I keep it realer than alien autopsy photo
You similar to a Spice Girl going solo
You lost like BeBe, or a dog named Toto
My statue of liberty is Rebecca Lobo
We Cop Robo, Virgo
Bust ass like a motherfucking homo, como estas?
Tony Del Negro, built to destroy these kids' blocks of Legos
L'eggo my Eggo 'cause I say so
Hold the microphone, 4-Ize, I stay gifted
Manifested, elevated, I uplifted
The elevator, the escalator, "That's not a knife?
That's a knife!" Crocodile Dundee, the alligator rustler
'Cause I hustle ya, under the China
Big Trouble, little sewer, but still I find ya
'Cause I'm stinky, manifest, throw you down the stairs like a slinky
Yo, my third eye is blinky
