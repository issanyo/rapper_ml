[Verse]
How could anybody go against me?
When my bitch’s ass is shaped like a lower case b
And you know I got them M’s I ain’t ever sold a [?]
Click my heals and my connect is the Wizard of O-Z’s
I’m on e’erything, bitch I’m higher than a drone
And your bitch is gettin’ tapped like there’s wires on her phone
I put my settings on mute, you can still hear her screamin’
Had a orgy when I came it was a riot for my semen
I’m a boss, I could never be nothin’ lesser
Gimme brain, gimme brain, call me Nutty Professor
Do your homework or find that ass in detention
I call it domework, now that’s a head intervention
Bitch keep your head down, I keep my head in the stars
Make me the coach of San Diego, head nigga in charge
I’m screamin’ “head’s up!” while they catchin’ these fly balls
Fuck the world, Luda Bond, I nut and the sky falls
