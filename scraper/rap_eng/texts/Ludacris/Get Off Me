[Intro: Ludacris & Pastor Troy]
What (what), what (what), what (what), what (what)
I (I), I (I), I (I), I (I)
Okay, come on, what
What (what), what (what), what (what), what (what)
Oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh)

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play

[Verse 1: Ludacris & Pastor Troy]
You wanna rush me, you can't touch me, trust me
'Cause you way too dusty, and rusty, and musty
You betta shop that make you pop up from lock up
But you tell your folks to hold your jack up to back up (to back up)
I'm ready, so sit down or go ta' your room
It ain't nothin'
Ayy, ayy, watch out, watch out, boom
Call me the hit man, 'cause I make you wanna call time-out
Then I make your mom cry out, when I take your whole spine out
Then watch me take ya, and fake ya, and shake ya, and break ya
And see you on home to your maker
You should give up now for talkin' shit like that
But then you nothing, you garbage you betta' watch ya' back

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play

[Verse 2: Pastro Troy & Ludacris]
(Okay, okay, now)
Now it's the Pastor, shook 'em, showin' my moves
I'm in that 2000 excursion
Ridin' on 22's, I hear da boom
But booms just get me more crunk
It's the DSGB forever
Ridin' on pump
I stunk, or did I say stunk, I meant stank (UN huh)
I think I'll take it please, or in another coffee break
You ain't, but you can pretend to be homey
I'm stiff arming these busters just as soon they get on me

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
