[Verse 1: Ludracris]
She jingalin, she too legit
She seemed to know just what to do with it
She proud of it, other women gotta really acknowledge it
Just when she hit that stripper pole, her booty swallow it
So go girl, go get it
Go girl, go kill it
See if your girl with my girl, your girl goin' get to business
We going to take a sip of that potion, put some things in motion
We going to slice her and dice her, then bust a bitch wide open
Cuz it's fre-freak-freaks-anonymous united here
You niggas ain't invited here
I got me a girl from the ghetto
Now jingal that shit like it's jello

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm claiming it, yeah she's aiming it
Right at me, so I could put my name on it
She banging it, trap star, she's slanging it
She got to work and put all these women to shame with it
And damn the girl so bout it
Yeah the crown she's got it
She be jingalin so much, she got me digging all in my wallet
I'm like oohh the girl deserve it
Man her body so perfect
When she step out in the club, every single one of you bitches get murdered
So you best come with your A game

[Hook]

Jingal, jingal, jingal, jingal, jingal, jingal

[Verse 3]
That girl hella bad, I wanna pop hella tag
The way that booty propels, it needs a hellipad
Or a landing strip, ain't no need to panic trick
Drop that apple bottom right down on my banana clip
I cock it, aim it and shoot it
So insane how you move it
Love it how you drop it like it's hot
Then take a little time off and just cool it
Cuz it need some time to breathe
Go on and give it a squeeze
Cuz them lips, hips, thighs and even them double Ds be --

[Hook]
