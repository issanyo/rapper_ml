[Ludacris]
Ow! Track-stars woo...hey... DTP
Let's Go

[Chorus: Bobby V x2]
She's dangerous, super fast
Better watch out she'll take ya cash
She's a gold... digger (sho' is)
She's a gold... digger (sho' is)

[Ludacris]
Yeah, she's a money magnet, smell a dollar bill in ya clothes
Gold digger style from her head to her toes
You hear me sayin no don't mess with this dress
She's out to get ya dough none more none less
Shes lookin' for a prize, man you killin me
Actin like you don't see the dollar signs in her eyes
You wanna nail done, and I help, too
Plus a diamond necklace, thats all on you
You still can't see it, yeah you a sucka
If you do it homeboy man I couldn't be it
Hypnotized by her goodlooks?
Yeah maybe, but a victim for a good crook? Nope not me!
Consider yourself warned so you can stay
Or you can stick to my rhyme and get the heck away!
Either way, go figure, she's a gold digger
Gettin' close as your bank roll grows bigger

[Chorus: Bobby V x2]
She's dangerous, super fast
Better watch out she'll take ya cash
She's a gold... digger (sho' is)
She's a gold... digger (sho' is)

[Lil' Fate]
You gotcha way with a beauty
A treat with a brain
When she look at you she only see "ching-ching"
Be around your neck, reel around your arms
A championship ring, she must be a bowla hard
She turns on the leader, as soon as you need her
Unless you bite the bait, you look mighty thico
When money talks she ticks like F.B.I
Ready to handcuff the right guy
Look you in the eye, and tell a boldface lie
Schemin on the way to money yo, well ya tried
Guess its a game now, gotta watch who you trust like her because, its only out for your books, yes sir
She's all about being paid
At the end of everyday its a fine new grade
What more can I say? But the wires up front
Better watch out, she'll leave yah with insuffiant

[Chorus: Bobby V x2]
She's dangerous, super fast
Better watch out she'll take ya cash
She's a gold... digger (sho' is)
She's a gold... digger (sho' is)

[Bobby V]
She's seen fancy cars
She's seen movie stars
You better watch your back
She'll be spending up your cheque
Oh yeah. For the growin... just won't stop
Will be rottin in your eyes
She's a...Gold digga, gold digga, gold digga yeah

[Ludacris]
She's dreaming
Schemin on a way to get your dough
She hit the lottery and now you hit the gold
So where's her cash sack?
Man, you just don't know
Because you got got and thats for show

[Lil' Fate]
Oh eyah she's a superstar chick
But don't do it unless you got miles of risk
Dhe's a pimpstress running more games than the olympics
Aha uh uh huh

[Chorus] - repeat 'til fade
