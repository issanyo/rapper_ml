[Ludacris:]
Yea we right back at ya between the sheets

So get a firm grip and hold on tight as the home boy sean garrett take you on a ride
(Oooo) Luda! (oooo yea) I don't think they ready dog (ey!)

[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Look at you!
Girl remember wat u sed I couldn't have u when I met you...
When I told you one day girl up in my bed id get you
Now you won't stop askin when I'm comin threw again
Tell me tell me tell me now

When I walked up on you, you told me that I didn't know you
Said there ain't no point gettin your number cause I can't call you
Told me that you liked them boys and big toys and little boys you don't
(Wait a minute stop track shawty couldn't said that now let me bring that back)

[Bridge:]
I keep it low just for girls that be thinkin like you
Thinkin a nigga ain't gettin no paper just because he ain't flashin no jewels
Baby girl my bank account stuffed just like that pillow that your squeezing on
Don't you know how many of my songs go runnin on the radio?

[Chorus:]
Grippin on the bed look at you grippin on the bed (grippin on the bed [x2])
I told you girl this you weren't ready for
Grippin on the bed girl what you mean you can't take no more?
We got the neighbors and them complaining about the banging of the headboard
Grippin on the bed look at you grippin on the bed (grippin on the bed [x2])
I told you girl this you weren't ready for grippin on the bed look at you grippin on the bed
We got the neighbors and them complaining about the banging of the headboard

[Verse 2: Sean Garrett]
Now you screamin' now you need me please don't leave me I can't get enough
All the things you said you'd never do your doing 2 me all too good
You're even doing things to me I can't believe I ever thought you would
(Woo woo woo woo, woo woo woo woo slow down)
Take it easy baby, before you can't let go
Cause I'm a beast when I go in girl I'm tellin you
And here's a lesson baby, never say what you won't do
Cause I got u grippin on my bed in your birthday suitsuit

[Bridge:]

[Chorus:]
Grippin on the bed look at you grippin on the bed (grippin on the bed [x2])

Grippin on the bed girl what you mean you can't take no more?
We got the neighbors and them complaining about the banging of the headboard
Grippin on the bed look at you grippin on the bed (grippin on the bed [x2])
