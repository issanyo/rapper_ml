Luda
Let me tell you bout the newest ish that just hit the shelves right
It's called conjure congac
So waddle up yo azz down to the nearest liquor store and get you some

[Chorus: x2]
Apple juice and conjure make em get naked
Me I just drank mines straight with no chaser
Luda get wasted on the every day basis
So tell the bartender bring some conjure cases

Luda get wasted I'm still on my business store
Got a new venture it's sellin out the liquor store
Betta get yo bottle while the bottle still lasting
I plaster  naked women on the bottle that's fashion
X o's blasting
Vso's smashing
All in one glass now it's time for some action
Mix with some oj I called that shit the sunshine
With minutemaid it's a renegade I hope you got the punch line
Conjure and colon yea I named it move over
Cause soon as I jump in the whip I'm passing niccas in the rover
All up on the shoulder
Drive it like a maniac
How low can you go khaled won't you play me that
Mix it with some apple juice I call it lose your mind
But conjure with lime I call that shit a good time
Call myself the mac
I get em all up in the sac
And you know they always say that yak will put em on they bacc

[Chorus: x2]
Apple juice and conjure make em get naked
Me I just drank mines straight with no chaser
Luda get wasted on the every day basis
So tell the bartender bring some conjure cases
