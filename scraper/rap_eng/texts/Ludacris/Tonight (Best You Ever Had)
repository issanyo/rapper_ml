[Verse 1: John Legend]
Alright
Ain't this what you came for?
Don't you wish you came more?
Girl, what you playing for?
Ay, come on
Come on let me kiss that
Ooh, I know you miss that
What's wrong? Let me fix that
Twist that

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I hit you with the best stroke
Freestyle and then the breaststroke
Til you blowing cigarette smoke
And now the bed's broke
So what we gonna do now?
Fuck it, round two now
Work it out, then we cool down
Cool down

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
(Give me a little bit of that light-skinned love)
The best you ever had

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Luda! Listen
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowing me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot, I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga, bread stay popping like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella
We’ll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm
Sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
Cause seven days a week you’re my five course meal
(For real)

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
