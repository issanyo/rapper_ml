I ain't the one (x6)

[Hook]

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

[Verse 1: Luda]

I'm in the streets
With my street clothes
All up in the club lookin for the freak hoes
With them dope boys
Who make the best bucks
Moving packages, like UPS trucks
Paraphernalia in my stash box
I hit a button and the Bentley makes his ass drop
Yo rims too small
Gone shoo fly
These 24's that's Ronald McDonald's shoe size
Fresh pair of J's
I brought the Mike's out
And some ammo that'll knock a nigga lights out
Choppas everywhere
Call me the butcher
I got an AK and I ain't talking Ashton Kutcher

[Hook]

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]

2 Chainz!
3 Cell phones
I don't never answer (never)
4 girlfriends, 3 of em dancers
I'm doin shows
Yours is gettin cancelled
I'm the type that mix cough syrup with a Fanta
A-T-L-A-N-T-A that my resident
Jury on same color as the president (black)
2 Chainz I ain't ringing like a ringtone
Mink hat, mink coat
I'm feeling like King Kong
I ain't the one
Bitch this my theme song
Throwing blunts back and forth like ping-pong
I'm getting to the money's apostrophe
I fucked her on a pile of clothes
She a closet freak

[Hook]

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

[Verse 3: Luda]

I got some head from this chick
She like my baritone
Her name was Tara
She said welcome to the taradome
Phantom driver head
I'm the worst
All blue body lose the top I'm papa smurf Ayee
Hit the strip club
Bring the bucks out
Same way every day like a bus route
Lone ranger, no tonto
So my nine got my back
Like Rajon Rondo
The gat is out
Pulling night duty
Always exposed
Like Ice T wife booty
Pull a double shift
I'm on my grind
Watch 80 grand swag workin overtime

[Hook]

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit

When you see me in the streets
You better duck quick
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
Hell naw I ain't the one you wanna fuck wit
