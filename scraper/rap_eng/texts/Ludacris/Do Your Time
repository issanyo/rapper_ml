[Intro]
You have a call from an inmate in a correctional facility
Inmate, state your name
Darren
This phone call may be monitered and recorded
Press three if you accept the charges; if not, hang up

[Refrain: Ludacris]
To my cousin Darren Ransom, stay up homie
To my brother Chris Butler, stay up homie
If you locked in the box, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time)
Don't let your time do you
To my brother Mikey Mike, stay up homie
To my cuz J.B., stay up homie
If you locked in the box, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time)
Don't let your time do you

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
You lookin' at a man that would die for his daughter (yeah!)
Just to let her breathe
And I'd definitely die for Jesus cause he died for me (okay!)
Give my eyes to Stevie Wonder just to see what he's seen
But then I'd take 'em right back
To see Martin Luther's dream (woo!)
I'd dream that I could tell Martin Luther we made it (uh-huh)
But half of my black brothers are still incarcerated
Locked up in a cell block, lost from the shellshock
Some sold they soul, others used to sell rocks
Look up in my mailbox (yeah), I get letters from my cuz
And every week, said he wanna hit the streets
But he never struck a deal 'cause his mouth will never squeal
Put some money on his books and help him out with his appeal
Send some pictures of the fam and nasty pics of Shawnna (okay!)
If you ever have to leave
I got your mother and your daughter (gotchu!)
Born in this way of livin and our youth was stuck
To be safe, it's safe to say the justice system's fucked up

[Refrain: Ludacris]
If you doing 25 to life, stay up homie
I got your money on ice, so, stay up homie
If you locked in the box, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time)
Don't let your time do you
All my peoples in the pit, stay up homie
And until you hit the bricks, stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep makin' it through
Do your time, don't let your time do you

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Until I went to jail, you couldn't tell me I ain't seen it all
That box a motherfucker, it could stress a nigga balls
Especially when you broke
And home base ain't accepting your calls
And you don't hear your name when it's mail time
Got them damn jailhouse barbers pushin' back on your hairline
Fuckin' Sinequans'll have you stuck in that pill-line
Your bitch miss the V-I this weekend
The food in your locker keeps shrinkin', your celly feet stinkin'
The canteen ran out of menthols
Can't see how grown men wash other men drawers (eugh!)
Niggas play the phone room reckless
And get hit with new indictments
Talkin' about old connects and new prices (ugh)
Stress'll take a young nigga, give him an old face (or...)
Stress'll take a dumb nigga, give him a new case
That shit I used to tell my walkie, Lil' Itchy
All he did was smoke weed and drink coffee, I know he miss me

[Refrain: Beanie Sigel and (Ludacris)]
To my man Lil' Neal (stay up homie)
To my man Steve P (stay up homie)
If you locked in the box keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time)
Don't let your time do you
To my man Paul Selene (stay up homie)
To Abdul McKeith (stay up homie)
Until I see you in the streets, keep makin' it through
Do your time (Do your time)
Don't let your time do you

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Unh! if your people locked up, you need to send 'em some shit
Cause it's never too late to stop bein' a bitch
A magazine and some pictures is a nigga's whole world
When I was down, them niggas fell off, so I'm ridin' with the girls
Cause they got more heart than them fake-ass dudes
Ain't send no letters, no books, and no money for no food
'Cause commissary is so very necessary
It's so close to being slavery, in Texas, nigga, it's scary
I reached out to C-Murder right before I came home
And when them hoes let me go, I make sure that his books was on
And three months later, that nigga came home too
Ain't no limit to this shit cause now his dreams comin' true
I'ma keep ridin with Bun cause UGK will never stop
And I'ma stand up for my partners, steady let them off a lot
(Yeah!) Biatch, and I'm as trill as you can be
They scream "Free Pimp C" but now, see the pimp free
(Here I go! C-Murder!)

[Verse 4: C-Murder]
Wake up, roll call, another day gone by
Now put a 'X' on November 25
I'm still alive, oopen the death row balls (ch-chk)
Now this dead man walkin', parkin' million dollar cars
It's slavery, hard labor, catch the feel (catch the feel)
Redneck on the hearse while you walk, it's real
With a shotgun, burnin' at the back of your dome
Three hundred years left, my dawg ain't never comin' home (damn)
One fight, dude got stabbed, he lost an eye (uh-huh)
Almost died, in Camp Jay nigga, ride or cry (cry)
Cream has suicide attempts, Precious took his own life
White boys can't handle the pain at night (geah!)
You gotta fight for your shoes, or get your ass took (shoes)
And walk around with lipstick, and a pocketbook (pocketbook)
You all in, bitch, sit down when you piss (haha)
Sweet ass, you a ho, watch, I'll blow you a kiss, mwah

[Refrain: C-Murder and Ludacris]

Do your time (Do your time)
Don't let your time do you

[Refrain: Pimp C and Ludacris]
To my nigga Pharaoh (stay up homie)
To my nigga Z-Ro (stay up homie)
If you're locked in the box, keep makin' it through

Don't let your time do you
