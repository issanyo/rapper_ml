[Chorus: Jason Aldean]
Yeah I'm chillin' on the dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on the good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 1: Jason Aldean]
Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is gettin' old
You better mind your business man watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin' man y'all ain't listenin'
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missin'

[Chorus: Jason Aldean]
Yeah I'm chillin' on the dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on the good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Ha ha ha, Luda
Man I’m feelin' like a million dollars
Stacked up all hundred dollar bills (bills)
Got a whole six pack on ice (on ice)
But I’m ridin’ on the hottest wheels
Seat back and I'm curvin' swervin'
With my pedal to the metal like I'm racin'
Turn it up and let the speakers scream for Mr. Aldean but I call him Jason
Reminiscin' on the good times
Water balloons, super soakers
Wet t-shirts, women in bikinis
Kenny Rogers, penny loafers
Smoke blowin' out the window
And all my problems aside (aside)
Just feel that summer breeze
Lay back, kick it and enjoy the ride, Luda

[Chorus: Jason Aldean]
Yeah I'm chillin' on the dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on the good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride

Yeah I'm chillin' on the dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on the good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Outro: Ludacris & Jason Aldean]
Kick it and enjoy the ride
That's right
