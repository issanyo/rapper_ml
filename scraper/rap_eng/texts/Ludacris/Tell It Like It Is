[Karma] Daddy is that your car on TV?

[Ludacris]
You better believe it is baby
Now go in the other room
It's about to be some grown folks talkin here, okay?
All right

Yeah, things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be (okay)
Like all these fakin ass rappers in this industry (tell 'em!)
Talkin 'bout what they got and they ain't got a damn thang
How you own three cars but you don't own your own name? (woo!)
Get your business right boys, the first class is in session (okay)
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession (hey!)
Start up your own company, trademark the name
That's gon' run ya about a grand so start savin your change (DTP!)
Open a bank account quick and then follow these steps (uh-huh)
Sign yourself TO yourself and start signin ya own checks (woo!)
Hit the booth and start recordin at the speed and need
Whatever gets your juices flowin, could be speed or weed (what else?)
Get it mixed and mastered (hey) pressed up and plastered (okay)
Sell it to your whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard!
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be (hey!)
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me!

[Hook: Ludacris]
But I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is
I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

[Ludacris]
See mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems (yup)
Their money could be the problem but money can't solve 'em (nope)
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy (woo)
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy (woo!)
I'm close cause those close wanna live off my fame (yup)
And that type of shit ALONE'll drive a nigga insane (crazy!)
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandalous promoters (okay)
Crabs'll try to sue you, magazines'll misquote ya
Most of these label heads, they don't care nothin about ya (nah)
If you stop sellin records they'll act like they don't know ya
It's hard mixin business with pleasure so don't play
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other DAY (for real!)
Rappers ain't above the law but our life is so fast
That we got a special task force of police on our ass (true that)
All that, and this is really just the start of it (just the start of it)
Hip-Hop! You really wanna be a part of it?

[Hook: Ludacris]
Woo! I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Woo! Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is
Hey hey, I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
Man this biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
I'mma give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Hey! Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

[Ludacris]
Let's go!
What's worse than havin no money is havin it and losin it (yup)
What's worse than havin some money is grabbin and abusin it (yup)
We never took no money from Chingy, thought I was cool with him (nah)
I wish his ass well but I don't want NOTHIN to do with him (woo!)
Some don't own they publishin; me? I never fool with 'em (nah)
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em (believe it)
Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant (DTP!)
Unless I'm still in competition with my president (what up Jay?)
And believe that I'm supportin the Hova
Cause the industry's shady, it needs to be taken over (okay!)
But the first rule to accumulation of wealth (what's that?)
Is don't trust nobody but your GOD damned self!

[Hook: Ludacris]
Woo! I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
Man this biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
I'mma give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is
I said I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
I'mma give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

[Karma] Daddy are you finished with grown folk talk?

[Ludacris]
Yeah baby you can come back in here
Come give Daddy a kiss, you know I love you right?

[Karma] And I love you, always!
