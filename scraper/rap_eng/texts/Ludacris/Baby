[Verse 1]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I’ll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said "There’s another," and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

[Verse 2]
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can’t believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around
And I'm like

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
