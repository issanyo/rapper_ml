How low can you go? (x8)
How low can you go? (x8)

Luda!
She could go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up!
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans
Baby, pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I've ever seen it done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined did not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror
Now you doing it on the dance floor
Mad 'cause I can't get wit ya chick just show me how to dance (OH!)
I may not wanna get low so I post it up kinda like a playa do
But if you come to the crib
Then I might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar wit a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big
There's just one thing that I gotta know

How low can you go? (x8)
Go low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)

I be like Nick-nac-paddywac
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone
How many licks does it takes till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home
I could make me show stop
Soon as you hear this flow pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your drop
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really gettin low then Ima shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel
But when it comes to chocolate
I know that very well
Asian persuasion
No discrimination
I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butterican pecan peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces
'Cause I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big
Well there just one thing that I gotta know

How low can you go? (x8)
Go low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)

Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Don't stop (Get it, get it)
Put it on reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me what you workin wit
I'll show you some of this bank roll
Yea you a superstar there's just one thing I gotta know so

How low can you go? (x8)
Go low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)
