(Spoken)
Mama always told me
Baby, you gotta walk by faith
And not by sight
Real talk you gotta listen

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh, listen to me now, I'm gonna say it loud
So you won't be confused
'Bout what we talkin' 'bout
I been through the storm
Had dirt on my name
I'm still holding on
Champion of the game (they said)
Whatever don't kill you make you stronger
Well, I must be the world's strongest woman
See I done done a whole lotta growin'
Everything you say I'm already knowin'
Cuz I…

[Chorus]
I been up against ropes
Everything you're going through
I been there before
Seen them all come
And I seen them all go
You can bet your last that my head won't hit the floor
Never
And I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing
I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing

(Verse 2)
I had a lover take his own in front of me
I asked God why is this happening to me
But I didn't fold, I held my own
And now I'm deep in love with who I belong
(This is my life)
They say with age comes wisdom
And the white flag, I can't give 'em
Tryin' to tell you how it's s'posed to be
See, this is more than just a song to me
Cuz I…

[Chorus]
I been up against ropes
Everything you're going through
I been there before
Seen them all come
And I seen them all go
You can bet your last that my head won't hit the floor
Never
And I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing
I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing

(Ludacris)
I'm unbreakable, baby
Luda, yeah, it's a family affair
I may have done the things they say I did
But I'm not who they say I am
Try to throw my name in the dirt
But I really don't give a damn
I'm still standing like the statue of liberty
And I put my name in the history books
So you'll forever remember me
Remember me as the toughest warrior
Or the ultimate fighter
Cuz I'm the truth and nothing but
It's like my hands on the bible
And it's the survival of the fittest
The realest, it's not a facade
Still standing on my two feet
Cuz I'm a child of God
Do something

(Chorus 2x)
I been up against ropes
Everything you're going through
I been there before
Seen them all come
And I seen them all go
You can bet your last that my head won't hit the floor
Never
And I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing
I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing

(Ad-libs)
I'm not gonna give up, never
Come too far to look back, oh
Oh, ohhh
I been there before
I've seen it, I've seen it, I've done it
I've done it, I'm done
Let me live my life now
I let it go, I let God
I let it go, and I let God
Don't hate me now
I ain't who I used to be no more
I'm still standing, I'm still standing
I'm still standing, oh
I'm still standing
I'm still standing
You can't take this joy away
