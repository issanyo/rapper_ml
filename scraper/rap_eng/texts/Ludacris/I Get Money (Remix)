[Hook]
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (Yeah)
Money I got, money is got (Ohhh!)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (Yeah yeah)
Money I got, money is got (Ohhh!)
Luda!

[Verse]
Put the needle on the record, and a needle in your veins
If Luda's on your record, it will never be the same
'Cause Luda makes hits, other rappers make claims
I cut the braids off, but ain't a damn thang change
Lets get one thang clear, the South's right here
Still got the Grammy for the album of the year
12 mil sold still flying on lears
Over 30 million dollars in the past three years
'Cause I gets money, money I got
The first in the hood with the bentley drop top
The Jacob goes tick, Audemars go tock
Fruity Pebble diamonds, they say I'm on rocks!
I get that gua-po-le, own twelve properties
Only game I play: real life Monopoly, properly
And ain't no need for apologies, sorry is as sorry does
Follow me, 'cause...

[Hook]
