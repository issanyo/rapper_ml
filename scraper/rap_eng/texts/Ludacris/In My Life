[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Yeah, I used to care so much what people thought about me
Now I really could give a fuck
Not when I own over $15 million in real estate
And bought all the Fast & Furious trucks, haha
See, everyday I put in work and my salary grows
So excuse me I'm not caught up on reality shows
See the Bridges Family values on the south side
I live in Atlanta but do not have an Atlanta housewife
I'm not married, I've never been engaged
But your dumb-ass believes whatever's on the front page
See some of these bloggers don't even believe their own lies
Turn the computer screen into a mirror, look at'cha own lives
Cause technology exceeds all humanity
But there's a thin line between genius and insanity
Now private pics on my private, no longer private, man
Hope I can gets some privacy up on my private plane

[Hook: John Legend]
Ohhh, living in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'm a be alright, I'm a be alright
Let me live 'til I die

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I'm doing interviews
Getting asked the same questions from 10 years ago
Wondering to myself what the fuck I'm there for
Now that my daughter's a CEO at the age of 10
And I got restaurants inside Atlanta's airport
That repetition will drive any human being nutty
I'd rather be in my own crib, on my own couch
Thinking I gotta do what the fuck I wanna do money
Yeah, and then I went to Quincy Jones' house
Realize I didn't have shit, got some work to do
Soon as you get some money, it's gon' be someone with more than you
Sci-Fi movies, the fans said this album is overdue
And if you don't put some music out
These niggas gon' be over you
Talking about where that old Luda, for the rapper's sake
But Ursher told me if I don't evolve I'll evaporate
I've gotten better, motherfucker if you listen
If you're smart, and went to college better use your intuition

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, my own expectations I exceeded them
And when people say Luda's underrated, I'd agree with 'em
They said I'm so visual, they overlook the lyrics
But every verse you get a sample if your mind can clear it
Then steer it in the direction of your memory
And I'll be satisfied when I'm celebrated for centuries
Wrote a song for my girl she couldn't stand straight
My man said, "don't release it, you'll ruin your female fan base"
I said, "man, my female fan base gon' be here for forever"
Cause even though I'm with one, to them we're still together
And who am I to tell 'em different if my voice can freak 'em
Long as I can continue coming through all of that speakers
I'm a man of choice words but I speak the truth
And I ain't scared of shit except God in a life or jail suit
Especially when all of my bills are paid for
And God answered everything that I prayed for

[Hook x2]
