[Intro]
Hell yeah
It's an everyday struggle
Trying to get out, trying to get out, trying to make it
Check this out nigga, what

[Chorus]
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what

[Verse 1]
I need to get away to another day or place and time
And find where reality can ease my mind
And shine on me like the sun to the Earth
For what it's worth, my turf is rough and rugged so I gave birth
To a dream where cream lies between
All the dirt and the gravel, so I battle to achieve my green
And still try to move forward at a steady pace
Cause bad luck is interfering with my paper chase
So I erase the crime, lies, and sad cries
With sore eyes and keep mines on an up rise
But it don't work cause I'm steady getting jerked
By my neighborhood, up to no good, where bad niggas lurk
They irk me, leaving effects that's too negative
So Ludacris is looking for a better place to live
And I can't stand it, it's really got me bugging
It's like I'm in a war and I just keep on tugging
Cause I'm

[Chorus]
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what

[Verse 2]
I try to find a way out of this maze, it's got me crazed
I'm in a daze, so many ways to boost into a different phase
But I can't think I can't do nothing, you think I'm fronting
You hear me grunting Lord, you ain't even saying nothing
I need some currency before there's an emergency
Forget crimes, I won't let my mind get the best of me
It's not gon' happen, I'm trapped in two worlds
On one side I see diamonds, on the other I see pearls
It's a whirlwind disaster with two damn sides
So I'm gone with the wind then come right back with the tide
I keep my eyes on the skies and my head in the clouds
And when my mouth is shut up, it makes my thoughts get loud!
Just like a crowd in a stadium, mills I be craving them
Money making schemes locked up in my cranium
Cause I need out of this critical situation
My mind's in jail, I don't know the time that it's facing
Cause I'm

[Chorus]
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what

[Verse 3]
I'm sick of knocking, I'm sick of clocking
I'm sick of dropping in a hole, never reaching my goal
It's got my soul separated into pieces, it just increases
I'm hit with anger like a cook's hit with hot greases
So if you understood my attitude
Maybe you'd feel what I'm feeling
And it'd start appealing
To your intellect and aspect of dreams and aspirations
Death by temptations, even got my heart pacing
So I'm tracing a line where I can find a better path
And make it last, sit back and laugh before the aftermath
The tragic flaw is what makes it raw
So let it thaw and I'll get through it even if I have to crawl
My way, I see the sun and there's no delay
I'ma pray, cause the Lord'll make a brighter day
Or will he keep me in this holding cell?
But enough with the questions, the only story to tell is that I'm

[Chorus]
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what
