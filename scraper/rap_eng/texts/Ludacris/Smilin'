[Hook: Chevy P aka Smoke]
You be smilin when I'm frownin
You be frownin when I'm smilin
You be happy when I'm sad
But when I'm glad you get mad
You be smilin when I'm frownin
You be frownin when I'm smilin
You be happy when I'm sad
But when I'm glad you get mad
Yeaaaahhhh

I was young 16 put the city on my back
Said I'll do it I did it Albany on the map
Been +stickin to the script+ y'all really wanna +act+
Like I ain't the real reason y'all really wanna rap
They jealous they wanna step in my spot but you can +sneeze+
The rest of ya life and won't get the +blessings+ I got
I sold +butter+ made +bread+ plus I +roll+ wit +toast+
My brother call me +nearsighted+ say my foes is +close+
No friends its just a waste of time I know ya bogus
+Crooked behind my back+ ya like a +spine wit scoliosis+
I'm +focus+ed like the +Ford car+ +private+ like a +G4+
Try me get +shells+ in ya +waves+ like a +seashore+
See I don't be on what he on we grown he wrong
He gon keep on he gon be gone
+Two faced+ like +geminis+ I came up wit you man
I'll speak but I don't mess wit you man

Why is it when my frown is down side up ya smile is upside down
Is it because of my fly style is it my nice house
Is it cause I'm iced out and livin a life now that
I'm bout through strugglin everything is alright now
You see the Jag on them flats pass
Don't get mad get +glad+ like the +trashbags+ you just
Pray and pray on my downfall
When I'm up ya down me when I'm down ya clown me
Claimin to be my friend... but really softer than the spot
In my back to ease his knife in
He ain't got love for me I wrote a rhyme about it
That hole ya dug for me you tryna climb up out it
Ya bust ya head at the bottom now ya cryin about it
Well when around came right back around and got him
The more paper the more haters I need more cheese
Cause the haters I got they startin to bore me

[Ludacris]
From the tip of ya nose to the tip of ya toes
Y'all ain't nothin but some hatin (yeah yeah)
Smilin in my face everyday like "what up Luda"
I'm just waitin for the day to put a slug up to ya
Ol fake (fake) kissers walk past diss ya
Breathe you a wannabe me (me me me) why?
Cause I got new whips and wreck em or
Cause I got flows that make (blank) +bend it like Beckham+
Is it cause a lot of money stay close to me
Or is it cause you should have been where I'm supposed to be
Well everyday I stay fresh whole fam got cheese
So I could care less what you think about me
I thank my enemies and I truly adore em
Best way to get back at somebody is to ignore em
I'm the heavyweight champ we'll see who gon drop
Cause evrybody in the bottom know who on top
