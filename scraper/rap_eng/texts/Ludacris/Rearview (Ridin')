[Ludacris-Intro]
We gotta come back to ya
It's Bobby V. and Luda
We just wanna soothe ya
Bobby V. and Luda

[Verse 1]
This town is too small for the both of us
She's crying I'm packing stuff
Peelin', chrome wheelies burning dust
This time I'm really gone
About to turn this road into the Autobahn
Cause if I slow down I think I might change my mind

[Bridge]
I'll run (I'll run) as fast as I can (as fast as I can)
Foot on the gas down the highway again (again)
Switchin' lanes (lanes) not giving a damn (not giving a damn)
So catch up with you boy if you can

[Chorus:]
I'm running from my past
What's done I can't redo
I'm just, looking in my rearview (ridin')
Looking in my rearview (ridin')
Wanna right all of my wrongs
What's done I can't redo
I'm just, looking in my rearview (ridin')
Looking in my rearview (ridin')
My rearview (looking in) my rearview
(I can see you in) my rearview
(Looking in) my rearview

[Verse 2]
I'm pushing 80 MPH
I'm poppin' Nodos (nodos)
Caffeine, nicotine and a change of clothes, hit the road
I see your face and I miss you dear
Images in the mirror (closer than they appear)

[Bridge]
I'll run (I'll run) as fast as I can (as fast as I can)
Foot on the gas down the highway again (again)
Switchin' lanes (lanes) not giving a damn (not giving a damn)
So catch up with you boy if you can

[Chorus]
I'm running from my past
What's done I can't redo
I'm just, looking in my rearview (ridin')
Looking in my rearview (ridin')
Wanna right all of my wrongs
What's done I can't redo
I'm just, looking in my rearview (ridin')
Looking in my rearview (ridin')
My rearview (looking in) my rearview
(I can see you in) my rearview
(Looking in) my rearview


[Ludacris]
Luda
I got my pedal to the metal and I'm looking in
My rearview mirror, mirror
Never said goodbye
I jumped in my ride and shook like Shakira
Hear the noise that I'm making
While my trunk is steady shaking
And my heart skip a beat and
I'm thinking bout sneaking away with a freak on the weekend
But what in the hell was I thinking 'bout
Now I'm all alone tryna right my wrongs
Sittin' on chrome in a Cadillac brone trying to write this song
Can't believe that I'm leaving home
When I really wanna hear you scream and moan
My name's Ludacris and my team is strong
So hey Bobby V. gon' and sing this song

[Chorus]
I'm running from my past
What's done I can't redo
I'm just, looking in my rearview (ridin')
Looking in my rearview (ridin')
Wanna right all of my wrongs
What's done I can't redo
I'm just, looking in my rearview (ridin')
Looking in my rearview (ridin')
My rearview (looking in) my rearview
(I can see you in) my rearview
(Looking in) my rearview

[Ludacris]
We gotta come back to you
It's Bobby V. and Luda
We just' wanna soothe you
Bobby V. and Luda
Gotta come back to you
It's Bobby V. and Luda
We just wanna soothe you
Bobby V. and Luda
