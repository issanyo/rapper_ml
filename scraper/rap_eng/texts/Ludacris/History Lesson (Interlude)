[Ludacris]
Q-Tip 1991 you sun of a bitch, let’s listen to little Ludacris real quick

One, two, three check it (I’m twelve nigga)
I lift every voice and let sing
See I mean a rap not bust around just bust a cap dap row bust some spade
Cause I’m paid like a dealer
I’m looking at the man on the wall in the mirror
Snuff can get enough of that funky dope style touch the dial while I smile a while for a mile
Cause I kick kind of like karate, Miyagi, jujutsu

Damn, pause stop flow
That was like twenty years ago
I must of stole that shit from myself
