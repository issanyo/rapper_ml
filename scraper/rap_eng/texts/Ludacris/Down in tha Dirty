Down in the dirty south to be exact
Gettin money gettin money is a well known fact

Welcome to Atlanta, GA

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I hit heavy in the trunk so I say I'm heavy hittin'
My car just got a Jheri curl the paint's still drippin'
My whip so clean I turn lovers into haters
Then I make 'em come around like curl activator
There are none greater; I'm the freshest on the scene
Rap gaming Jones I'm the freshest on the team
But really I'm a coach spitting game to the players
And I'm yellow with that purp like I came with the Lakers
I'm out to get that paper, the mule and the acres
I'm repping for the rich, red, monkey bathing apers
So catch a contact like you inhaled Luda vapors
Cause rapers get smoked like I rolled in some paper
Put 'em in a ash tray throw away the roaches
Move them out my pathway show them who's the dopest
I bring home the bacon and protect it with the toasters
Like the lens on your camera, fuck, boy I'm so focused!

Welcome to Miami, FL

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
20 grand in the left
Another 20 in the right
Got my wallet in the back
And that thing packed tight
Credit cards don't need 'em
All the birds won't feed 'em
While I'm sitting at the table just me and family eatin'
E-class on the cell; discussing another mill'
Gucci Gucci bottle empty, daddy needs a refill
Up in frevay I'm standing on the bar
If it ain't a black truck it's a quarter million Maz'
I'm in love with kush and Kate Fox
If ya need anything hit the safe deposit box
Outta town for a month
Came home with a duffel that was one point something
Getting brain and I love it
Pimp, ask Khaled. Lobster salad
Mobster acknowledge I'm popping in Dallas
Pop collars I touch hoes like crep flow
The game in a choke hold
No I won't let go

Welcome to Houston, TX

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Well I done said said it before
But I guess it's best to repeat it
Dirty south in the building
With no losses we undefeated
Anybody think they can beat it must be on sherm
Got the streets on fire like raw scalps with a perm
I'm big worm and that big body slayer
Rip it open and you keep playing with my money
Smoke it like I'm a joke
I go for broke on the boulevard
In the paint and have a bitch nigga sliced from his eyes to his tank
You think I came at 225 pounds of trouble
Can't find a triller nigga than me if you had the Hubble
I been repping the dirty and I ain't finna to slow down
So if you ain't with it get out the way it's about to go down
You can get your issue like your ass subscribed
And when we ride there's nowhere that your ass can hide
Nigga try to come at me crooked like burners play craves
Have you running up north like a runaway slave
Played pussy your bluff even if it's your period
The dirty south niggas take their money too serious nigga
