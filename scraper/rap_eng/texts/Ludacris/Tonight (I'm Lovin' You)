[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias]
I know you want me
I made it obvious that I want you too
So put it on me
Let's remove the space between me and you
Now rock your body, oh
Damn, I like the way that you move
So give it to me, oh oh
Cause I already know, what you want to do

[Pre-Hook: Enrique Iglesias]
Here's the situation, been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, given my reputation
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
But tonight I'm loving you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know

[Verse 2: Enrique Iglesias]
You're so damn pretty
If I had a type then baby, it would be you
I know you're ready
If I never lied then, baby, you'll be the truth

[Pre-Hook: Enrique Iglesias]
Here's the situation, been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, given my reputation
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
But tonight I'm loving you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Luda)
Tonight, I'm gonna everything that I want with you
Everything that you need, everything that you want
I wanna honey, I wanna stunt with you
From the window to the wall, gotta give you my all
Winter and the summertime
When I get you on the springs, I'ma make you fall
You got that body that make me want to get up on the floor just to see you dance
And I love the way you shake that ass
Turn around and let me see them pants
You stuck with me, I'm stuck with you
Let's find something to do
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
But tonight I'm loving you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know

[Outro: Enrique Iglesias]
That tonight I'm loving you, yeah
