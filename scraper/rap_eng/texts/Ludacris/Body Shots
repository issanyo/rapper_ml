Fresh twenty one
Walk up to the club
Got my girls, cut the line
Cause we're a step above
Walk up to the bar
Buying drinks like a star
My girls, they wanna try it
So we had to buy it

Uh huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down
Uh huh, drink it up (ooh I think she likes it)
Uh huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down
Uh huh, drink it up (ooh I think she likes it)

Doing shots at the bar, body shots at the bar
My girls, they wanna try it, so we had to buy it
At the what? At the bar, at the what? at the bar
My girls, they wanna try it
So we're drinking like we're rock stars

Top alcohol, mix it up, mix it up
Got me laying down and I pull my shirt up
Baby get the whipped cream
Feeling like a wet dream
Got me at the bar doing body shots, now

Uh huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down
Uh huh, drink it up (ooh I think she likes it)
Uh huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down
Uh huh, drink it up (ooh I think she likes it)

Doing shots at the bar, body shots at the bar
My girls, they wanna try it, so we had to buy it
At the what? At the bar, at the what? at the bar
My girls, they wanna try it
So we're drinking like we're rock stars

[Ludacris:]
Can somebody, anybody, everybody please

Just tell me where all of my shots are
I'm trying to get them drunk and they're not far
Cause even though my name's Ludacris
When I get up in the club
I be drinking like a rock star
Pocket full of money and I'm throwing stacks
Grab a couple shots then throw 'em back
And conjure up your freaky side
When drinking the Conjure Cognac
Got you feeling kind of frisky and tipsy
We gon' drink 'till the bottle's gone
And these girls wanna try some things
And I'm a be the one that they try it on
Smoke, smoke, I'm a roll these papers
And ain't nobody on their best behavior
Cause I'm a taste this shot
Then I might taste you
If you come in all different flavors

[Kaci:]
Uh huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down
Uh huh, drink it up (ooh I think she likes it)
Uh huh, whip it up, lick it up, suck it down
Uh huh, drink it up (ooh I think she likes it)

Doing shots at the bar, body shots at the bar
My girls, they wanna try it, so we had to buy it
At the what? At the bar, at the what? at the bar
My girls, they wanna try it
So we're drinking like we're rock stars

Doing shots at the bar, body shots at the bar
My girls, they wanna try it, so we had to buy it
At the what? At the bar, at the what? at the bar
My girls, they wanna try it
