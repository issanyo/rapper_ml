(Intro)
It’s the motherfuckin LA Leakers
Leaks of the industry
The Los Angeles Leakers

(Verse: Ludacris)
They call me money makin Luda, flippin bread like a spatula
Every verse I spit is nothing less than spectacular
Check my vernacular, attackin rappers from they necks up
Your money feelin down, go to the doctor, get yo check up
West up, for this lyrical whoopin I’m bout to unwind
With dumb rhymes that’s finish your whole career off in one line
I got signed in 2000, been killing ever since
Just to sport thousand dollar, YSL’s with leopard prince
And I’ll put a foot in yo ass for talkin reckless or sayin I’m not the best
It’s get screwed like you in Texas
I check em right off the checklist
I tell em go tell they mama
It’s like I’m Vinnie Chase and these rappers is Johnny Drama
& my entourage is thick, I take em back to the basics
They wouldn’t make the cut, or see clearer if they got Lasic
Like it’s Mission Impossible and they Operation Shutdown
Still hold the title in the South so rappers what now?
Ahhhhh

What now?
