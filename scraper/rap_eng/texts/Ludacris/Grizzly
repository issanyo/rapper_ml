[Hook]
The world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy! (dizzy!)
Don't be a bear be a grizzly! (grizzly!)
The world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy! (dizzy!)
Don't be a bear be a grizzly! (grizzly!)
It's almost time..

[Verse 1]
Now if you gon slang then I hope you got dem pillars
And if you gon bang then I hope that you a killa'
And if you in the army, be the best you can be
And if you down with my clique den you best be a G
If you wanna run track then you better be the fastest
Wanna be the champ? all opponents get they ass kicked
If you wanna rap then you gotta kick flows
Wanna be a real pimp then you gotta pimp hoes
Stop fakin', stop frontin', hurry get up off yo ass
As the clock keeps tickin' and another day pass
We all in competition but who really want it most?
So if you gonna drive fast put yo pedal to the flo

[Hook]
The world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy! (dizzy!)
Don't be a bear be a grizzly! (grizzly!)
The world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy! (dizzy!)
Don't be a bear be a grizzly! (grizzly!)

[Verse 2]
If you wanna get rich you betta get up on yo grind
And you better hurry up we ain't got that much time
If you wanna be a baller be the MVP
And if you wanna be on top you should envy me
You wanna be the best teacher, know that you can get taught
Wanna be the best thief, you betta never get caught
If you fed up with the game, young playa, don't play
But if you gon do something better do it all the way
Stop fakin', stop frontin', hurry get up off yo ass
As the clock keeps tickin' and another day pass
We all in competition but who really want it most?
So if you gonna drive fast put yo pedal to the flo

[Hook]
The world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy! (dizzy!)
Don't be a bear be a grizzly! (grizzly!)
The world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy! (dizzy!)
Don't be a bear be a grizzly! (grizzly!)

[Verse 3]
Now make noise! Make noise!

Put ya hands in the air and make noise! (make noise!)
Make noise! Make noise!
Make noise! Make noise!
Put ya hands in the air and make noise! (make noise!)

Cause we some soldiers (we some soldiers)
