[Link: Ludacris]
Turn it, turn it, turn it up
Turn it, turn it, turn it up

[Verse 1: Example]
I've never been afraid of the highest heights
Or afraid of flying, now
I've never been afraid of the wildest fights;
Not afraid of dying!
But now I want off this ride, cause you're scaring me
And I don't like where we're going
I need a new fun fair, cause you're scaring me
And I don't like where we're going

[Chorus: Example]
And now you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me
I guarantee you'll miss me
Cause you changed the way you kiss me
Cause you changed the way you kiss me

[Post-Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah, I don't want it, you can have it back
I don't want it, you can have it back
I don't want it, you can have it back

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
You don't know how much you miss me till I'm, until I'm gone
When I met you, you had me weak but now I'm, but now I'm strong
I thought I was your Mr Right, but who's right if you Mrs Wrong?
For example, Example had to make an example so he added a Luda verse to the song
You changed the way you kiss me, you changed your sexy style
You changed your walk, your talk, when I gave you an inch, you take a mile
On the road in the wrong direction, see you really headed nowhere fast
I'm done with all your games, matter of fact who needs your ass?

[Bridge: Example]
Our love feels wrong, please wind it back
Our love feels wrong, can't hide the cracks
I guarantee you'll miss me
Cause you changed the way you kiss me
