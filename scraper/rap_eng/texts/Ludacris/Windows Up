[Chorus: IDK]
We need a drink
Then maybe that can lead me to your panties girl
What do you think? (CPR, CPR)
I could put the pipe on you, ooh, ooh
I could put the pipe on you, aye, aye
I could put the pipe on you, ooh, ooh
I could put the pipe on you, ooh, aye
I could put the pipe on you, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus: Shawnna & (IDK)]
Back seat, windows up (uhh)
That's the way we like to fuck (uh-huh)
Back seat, windows up (uh-huh)
That's the way we like-like-like to (uhh, uhh)
Back seat, windows up (uhh)
That's the way we like to fuck (uh-huh)
Back seat, windows up (uh-huh)
That's the way we like to-like to (uhh, uhh, fuck fuck)

[Verse: IDK]
You tell me that you hate me then you love me when we (fuck fuck)
I ain't the best at texting but I text you cause we (fuck fuck)
You say you want some feelings, all this fucking ain't enough (nah)
I tell you that I feel it, frankly that is just a (bluff bluff)
That pussy do some things to me (some things to me)
That pussy got control from just a fantasy
If thinking I can get it even if I didn't thankfully
Love lockdown so she never get a thing from me
I'm telling you, posting pictures ain't the perfect picture cause the likes hot
Double tap the kitty, climaxing is the right hot
She just want the physics and emotions at the right time
I say cut the bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, girl

[Chorus: IDK]
We need a drink (ooh nah, ooh nah)
Then maybe that can lead me to your panties girl
What do you think? (CPR, CPR)
I could put the pipe on you, ooh, ooh
I could put the pipe on you, aye, aye
I could put the pipe on you, ooh, ooh
I could put the pipe on you, ooh, aye
I could put the pipe on you, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus: Shawnna & (IDK)]
Back seat, windows up (uhh)
That's the way we like to fuck (uh-huh)
Back seat, windows up (uh-huh)
That's the way we like-like-like to (uhh, uhh)
Back seat, windows up (uhh)
That's the way we like to fuck (uh-huh)
Back seat, windows up (uh-huh)
That's the way we like to-like to (uhh, uhh)
