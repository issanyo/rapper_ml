[Intro: Ludacris]
Yes, yes
Another installment, this simply just does not stop, man
It's a feeding frenzy going on, nigga!
Luda! Listen!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Polo slippers, I'm a G, bitch!
Just did a show, been counting paper for a week, bitch
3 sips, I'll tear the club up like 3-6
Hanging with nines that could cause a solar eclipse
Luda! It's lunar how I maneuver in the night time
If it's bad bitches, it's the right time
Vintage Rolex, time pieces that last a life time
Whenever I decide to show up, that's my flight time
Tell the pilot I'm about to roll a doobie up
Louis'd up, bitches want a snack, Scooby Doo me up
Ruby'd up, fruity colored diamonds cause I'm movied up
Women screw me up, love me down then they chew me up
Just gettin' started, it's about to get solidified
Lyrical genocide, Ludacris has been identified
As one of the greats of all time, what am I to do?
Generation pimps, granddaddy and my father too
What the fuck are y'all thinking, this is heaven sent
8 albums in, other rappers are irrelevant
It's evident that I'm so elegant and intelligent
These other clowns sound like they rapping with speech impediments
Ol' dribble mouth niggas, y'all should lay it up
Play it up, talking about your life like you made it up
Well here's a story for the ages, I'm a living legend
And my security guards are named Smith & Wesson

[Outro: Ludacris talking]
Fuck an adlib on this one, man, let it ride
This for the fans, I love y'all, baby
Ludaversal, March 31st! I'm trynna fucking tell y'all
Best album I ever did, nigga. Hungry, boy!
[?], we going places, man
