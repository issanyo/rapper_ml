[Hook:]
(What you talkin' 'bout money?) money bitch, I blow it
(Talkin' 'bout weed?) shorty, come roll it
(Talkin' 'bout hoes?) yeah, they goin'
What about me? bitch, I'm rollin'
(I've got my) double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down

[Verse 1]
Double cup with my logo, 36 of that coco
Yeah, the product's good, you know the number's right
And if you've got to check, then it's a no-go
All this snow, I've been a snow man
Always blowin' strong, talkin' Conan
Fuck who lied to ya, can you believe this shit?
Fuck both of y'all, I fear no man
My top quit and that trippy, seats tan, Rice Crispy
Got a wooden handle and a shoulder strap
Fits in your trunk, it hold 50
Too many chains, that look crook
Pyrex and water would best cook
See my lil' homie with me he hold me down
He gon' take the shot just like Westbrook
"Who he think he is?" I said VP
Vice President Young, you've got to see me
Nigga fuck around won't get an album date
I'll have 'em drop your ass on GP
Now I'm fucked up and that's fucked up
Your bitch on me now, tough luck
I don't do the lean, don't fuck with molly
And that's grown shit in that white cup
We talkin' bout...

[Hook:]
(What you talkin' 'bout money?) money bitch, I blow it
(Talkin' 'bout weed?) shorty, come roll it
(Talkin' 'bout hoes?) yeah, they goin'
What about me? bitch, I'm rollin'
(I've got my) double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down

[Verse 2]
Double cup with my top down, .40 cal', couple GLOCK rounds
Handcuffed your chick, that bitch on 24-hour lockdown
And rappers got these stale flows, front hard like steel toes
The man behind that voice is gay as fuck, y'all niggas Elmos
Been twelve years, I still shine, money long, I still grind
Used to be a thousandaire, but I had to eat - it's meal time
Then after that it's bill time, we fuck hoes to kill time
Your plane got them delays, we on my jet, nigga, in real time
And all up on that WiFi, sippin' on them Mai Tais
Infamous just passed the weed and gave the pilot a high-five
Meanwhile, y'all broke down, can't even hold your post down
Everywhere we go is poppin'
Everywhere you go's a fuckin' ghost town!

[Hook]
(What you talkin' 'bout money?) money bitch, I blow it
(Talkin' 'bout weed?) shorty, come roll it
(Talkin' 'bout hoes?) yeah, they goin'
What about me? bitch, I'm rollin'
(I've got my) double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down

[Verse 3]
Gettin' money, that's every day, candy paint on my Chevrolet
Rollin' up that A+, 'bout to pour up to meditate
A nigga so high, might levitate, one life to live, let's celebrate
Came a long way from sellin' yay'
Now it's a 100K that should touch the stage
"Bandz A Make Her Dance" #1 on the Billboard
I can't complain, I've got a lifestyle that most y'all niggas'd kill for
I'm on the grind chasin' real dough, still kick shit like a steel toe
Codeine got me movin' slow
I've got too much money for a bill fold
Pimp-type shit, I'm a Fort-Wayne nigga
In a ho mouth like dentures, nigga
All I talk is big money, anything else is senseless, nigga
Smoke some more, I'ma sip some more
I'ma fuck your bitch 'til she pigeon-toed
In the Rolls Royce gettin' chauffeured
With the blinds closed, gettin' blowed

[Hook]
(What you talkin' 'bout money?) money bitch, I blow it
(Talkin' 'bout weed?) shorty, come roll it
(Talkin' 'bout hoes?) yeah, they goin'
What about me? bitch, I'm rollin'
(I've got my) double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
