[Usher:]
If you live for something, you’re not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and, lift your lighter, and toast to life

[Ludacris:]
Luda!

They say what don’t kill me, can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
Cause why tip-toe through life, to arrive safely at death?
I’m on a journey, yeah; I’m on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes, just to open my soul
And tonight is the night, I gotta feeling that I’m about act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks, me and Usher are about to break some rules!

[Usher:]
That’s somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I’m ready to pay, for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

[beat break]

[Ludacris:]
If I got one life to live, I’mma party til I’m dead!
What the hell is a life worth living if it’s not on the edge?
Tryna keep my balance; I’m twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone, it should say: "Women, Weed, and Alcohol"!

[Usher:]
That’s somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But the what it's worth, I’m ready to pay for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

[beat break]

[Usher:]
If you live for something, you’re not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and, lift your lighters, and toast to life! (Yeah)

[Ludacris:]
I’m stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of my time
Cause I feel inner peace when I’m outta my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So I’m willing to bet that I’mma be crazy

[Ludacris & Usher:]
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
