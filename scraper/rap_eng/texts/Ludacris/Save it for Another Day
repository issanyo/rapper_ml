[Hook]: save it for another day
I ainâ€™t try to hear that shit no way
Hold up
Let me take two steps
And you can miss me with that bullshit
Miss me with that bullshit
Miss me with that bullshit

[Verse 1]: you looking at a eight figure nigga
Gone of the liquor
And I'm Fired up like the booty of a swisha
Make the trunk shake like a California quake
And everywhere I go these bitches tryna take my picture
All white beamer accentuated features
Salt around the rim like a fucking margarita
Cops profiling but Im still wylin'
Hopin that they never find the cannabis sativa
Smoke in moderation like niggas on probation
I break it like a record then I put it in rotation
Pass it like a test cause this system got me stressed
So when they stop me askin for license and registration I'm like

[Hook]

[Verse 2]: Yeah, pass the lighter
I'm rolling like a tire
And yeah we are about to blow I got that bomb like alquaeda
The streets are not at ease so I keep the desert eeeg (eagle)
Any given day you can get this cannon like mariah
Yea I rock your cradle drop you like your label
Got some firearms come illegal like my cable
Try me and you wishin for a gang of ammunition
I'm handy with this cap people thinkin I'm disabled
Couple ladies with me cause I'm long like pippy
So you'll just find yourself in a manage like nicki
A sucker for them curves with over a billion serves
I said bitch get on Dees (this) and I ain't talkin bout mickey

[Hook]

Ugh Far from sober drivin on the shoulder
Bass boom trunk got that thunder like Oklahoma
Woofers and them tweeters My Acura got beat
My kickers go hard yea my speakers got a boner its
Chrome kitted five percent tinted
On the highway gettin head I told her push me to the limit
She got my balls sprung like I hit a home run
She make her mouth streeetch like the fuckin seventh innin'
So its one two three strikes you outta there
Luda got em playin with they self like solitaire
Birds of a feather 'spose to stick together
But thicker women sayin they friend look like Halle Berry
I'm like

[Hook]
