[VERSE 1 - Bobby Valentino]
Tell me baby why
Why you'd wanna hide
What you feel inside, cause I feel it
Sexy girl you oughta
Put away ya pride
Cause you say I with your eyes
We can hang out for the weekend
But for now I wanna know

[Hook]
Why you lookin at me like that
Do you like what you're lookin at
If you do, what you waitin on
Let's have a conversation
I'll find a corner over there
Lights down, perfect atmosphere
On the real, I'll make you want me
Right now, gimme a chance
[VERSE 2 - Bobby Valentino]
I see you whisperin
Don't you worry about ya friends
Gotta a little spot, we can go kick it
Sit back, relax, get you a drink and
Get to know each other
Girl let me know whats up
We can leave up outta this club
Girl I'm feelin you so bad

[HOOK]
I see it in your eyes
I'm what you fantasize
You told your girls you wanted to meet
Someone like me, act like me
Walk with a swagger
Little thug in me, but friendly
Dipped down just the way you like
Here I am, come and get me (come and get me yeah, yeah)

Don't procrastinate

If you make the first move
I'll even meet you half way
It's almost too late
The lights are coming on

[HOOK]

Someone like me, act like me (just like me)
Walk with a swagger (yeah yeah)
Little thug in me, but friendly (alright)
Dipped down just the way you like
Here I am, come and get me

[VERSE 3 - Ludacris]
You know I see you in the spot just walkin' around solo
You know you see the ice, the Louis Vuitton logo
Seems you need a man that'll spin you 'round
Turn you inside out and upside down
Bet you never had it like that before
We can take it real slow or your back can blow
It's whatever, whenever, you make the choice
And I'mma call you 'Duncan Hines' just keep it moist
(come and get me)

[Hook]
Why you lookin at me like that
Do you like what you're lookin at (lookin at)
If you do, what you waitin on (waitin on)

Lights down, perfect atmosphere (come on here baby)
On the real, I'll make you want me
Right now, gimme a chance (gimme a chance baby)
Why you lookin at me like that
Do you like what you're lookin at (do you like what your lookin at baby)
If you do, what you waitin on
Let's have a conversation
I'll find a corner over there (oh yeah)
Lights down, perfect atmosphere (come on here)
On the real, I'll make you want me (want me)
Right now, gimme a chance (right now, gimme a chance, baby alright)
Gimme a chance (give it to me baby)
(All you gotta do is meet me half way then we can holler)
Gimme a chance

Gimme a chance (I got somewhere really quiet we can go chill at
Off in the cut baby)
