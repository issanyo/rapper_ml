How you ain't gon' fuck? Bitch, I'm me
I'm the goddam reason you in VIP
CEO, you don't have to see ID
I'm young wild and strapped like T. Ali
We ain't got nothin' to worry 'bout
Whupp ass, let security carry 'em out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
Feels like a midget is hangin' from my necklace
I pulled up wit a million trucks
Lookin' smellin', feelin' like a million bucks
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle off smoking that cheech and chong
"What's wrong?" The club and the moon is full
And I'm lookin' for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get 'em out of them pants
Take notes to da brand new dance like this
When I move you move
(Just like that?)
When I move you move
(Just like that?)
When I move you move
(Just like that?)
Hell, yeah! Hey D.J. bring that back

Go on, wit' ya big ass, let me see somethin'
Tell ya little friend, he can quit mean muggin'
I'm Lint, and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at wit' my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the backdoor and break 'em in
The owner already pissed 'cuz we sorta late
But our time and our clothes gotta coordinate
Most girls lookin' right, some lookin' a mess
That's why they spillin' drinks all over your dress
Wit Louis Vatteaun bras all over ya breasts
Got me wantin' to put hickies all over ya chest
Come on, we gon' party tonight
God use mouth-to-mouth, bring the party to life
Don't be scurred, show another part of ya life
The more drinks in ya system, the harder to fight
When I move you move
(Just like that?)
When I move you move
(Just like that?)
When I move you move
(Just like that?)
Hell, yeah! Hey D.J. bring that back

Damn right, the fire marshall wanna shut us down
Get us out, so someone can 'gun' us down
We was two songs away from gettin' some cunt up
Now, we one song away from tearin' the club up
Move over, Luda got somethin' to say
Do it now, 'cuz tomorrow ain't promised today
Work wit me, let's become one with the beat
And don't worry 'bout me stepping all over ya feet
When I move you move
(Just like that?)
When I move you move
(Just like that?)
When I move you move
(Just like that?)
Hell, yeah! Hey D.J. bring that back
(When I move you move)
