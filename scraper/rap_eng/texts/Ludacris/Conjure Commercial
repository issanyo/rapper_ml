(Oh oh oh)

Load It, cock It, aim and shoot
Load It, cock It, aim and shoot

Living like we bulletproof
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
(I say) We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(Oh) We load it, cock it, aim and shoot

Some will die over oil
Kill over land
Charge you for taxes
And blame Uncle Sam
Read you your rights
And charge you for nothing
Now who's really gangsta and tell me who's frontin'
Murder your sons, ravage your daughters
Here overseas and across the waters
Tanks and missiles
Bombs and grenades
Inject your land with guns and AIDS
You betta' pray to the most high or who ever you praise
'Cause politicians can't help you they puppets to slaves
Trying to get paid and you are too
Whatcha gone do when the gun is pointed at you (like bank robbers)

Living like we bulletproof
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
(bang, bang, bang, bang, bang bang)
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(load it, cock it, aim and shoot)
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(We gone die)
Living like we bulletproof
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
(bang, bang, bang, bang, bang bang)
(I say) We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(load it, cock it, aim and shoot)
(Oh) We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(Hey world)

Get you a paper
Turn on the news
Ride through the hood
I witness the blues
How can you ignore it
It's easy to spot it
A trap house, a liquor store and your city's got it
And my city's got it, and their city's got it
This world is chaotic
And love is symbolic
So life don't get cherished
So our babies perish, and your babies perish
Now tell me who's careless
Now who should I pray to
What should I pray for
You can't pay the preacher for your redemption
I know where we're headed
I already read it
The good book done said it (like cowboys and Indians)

(We just) Living like we bulletproof (Yeah)
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
(bang, bang, bang, bang, bang bang)
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(load it, cock it, aim and shoot)
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(We gone die, living)
Living like we bulletproof
We (we) bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
(bang, bang, bang, bang, bang bang)
(I say) We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(load it, cock it, aim and shoot)
(Oh) We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(We gone die, living)

They say tomorrow's not promised today
But today I promise if we don't make our own way
Somebody'll take it from us
Snatch it like rats to cheese
So, lord help me please
Cause I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I'm bulletproof cocking the Glock and aim n shoot
My future's ever clear 180 proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride and drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreaming of betta' days
Dreaming of betta' pay
But we got our work cut out for us so we betta' pray
Pray to uphold the weak, not for eternal sleep
But if I die I pray the lord my soul to keep

Living like we bulletproof (woo)
We (we) bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
(bang, bang, bang, bang, bang bang)
(I say) We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(I say I load it, cock it, aim and shoot)
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(We load it, cock it, aim and shoot)
Living like we bulletproof
We (we) bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
(bang, bang, bang, bang, bang bang)
(I say) We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(load it, cock it, aim and shoot)
(Oh) We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
(Oh lawd)

Living like we bulletproof
