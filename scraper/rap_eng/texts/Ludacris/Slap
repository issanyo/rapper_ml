[Hook - 2X]
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sipping on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slapping a nigga today (slap slap)
Slapping a nigga today
I feel like slapping a nigga today (slap slap)
Slapping a nigga today
Slapping a nigga today

[Verse 1]
This morning, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed (bed)
I'm sick of people putting lies in my head (head)
I don't really wanna work, I'm tired
I hate my 9 to 5
And I'm thinking bout killing my boss today
Killing my boss today
I'm thinking bout killing my boss today (it's just a thought man)
Killing my boss today (yeah)

Yesterday my best friend died (died)
Somebody came and took his life (life)
Now I'm looking up at the sky
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
And I'm asking why did you take him away?
Why did you take him away?
I'm asking why did you take him away? (why'd you take him?)
Why did you take him away? (hey)

I need some money please (please)
I can barely make it on these streets (these streets)
Cause I got a couple mouths to feed
My baby's in dire need
So I'm thinking bout robbing a bank today
Robbing a bank today
I'm thinking bout robbing a bank today
Robbing a bank today (real talk)

Baby mama's at home and fussing (fussing)
Calling up my mobile cussing (cussing)
Always yapping about this and that
But she really don't be talking bout nothing
Somebody take my pain away (Take my pain away)
Take my pain away (please)
Somebody take my pain away (hey)
Take my pain away (I can't take it)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Somebody just broke in my ride (ride)
Snatched up everything inside (inside)
Even got my 45
How am I supposed to survive
When I know that my stereo's taken away?
Stereo's taken away?
When I know that my stereo's taken away? (I need my music, man!)
Stereo's taken away? (hey!)

Gas prices are way too high
Rich people are way too fly
And I'm where I wanna be in my life
But why am I so behind?
Is it cause I'm wasting my time away?
Wasting my time away?
Is it cause I'm wasting my time away? (too lazy)
Wasting my time away? (I can't help it!)

My grandmama's nerves are bad (bad)
And everybody in the hood is mad (mad)
Cause President Bush could give a damn about our ass
So I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say (don't say nothing!)
Shit that he has to say
I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say
Shit that he has to say (woo!)

Troops gone and we still at war (war)
Nobody even really knows what for (what for)
Even more I'm scared to find what the world really has in store
Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (it's not promised, man)
Tomorrow's not promised today
Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (live like today could be your last, man!)
Tomorrow's not promised today (hey!)
