Gangsta whitewalls, TV antennas in the back (the back, the back...)

[Hook]
I wanna (diamond in the back)
I wanna (sunroof top)
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
I wanna (diamond in the back)
I wanna (sunroof top)
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
I wanna (diamond in the back)
I wanna (sunroof top)
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
I wanna (diamond in the back)
And I wanna (sunroof top)
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
Diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the...

[Verse 1]
It's hard growin' up lookin' at drug dealers wit' all this paper
Wonderin' how I can get me some
My family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch
So confused, chewin' on some bubblegum
I was always taught to use my manners with the misses
But please, stay away from the hoes and snitches
And I was always reached for the sky, I dont know why
Ima little bitty kid wit' a whole buncha gangsta wishes
When I grow up, you just wait, Ima be so straight
And everything's gonna be so marvelous
No more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges
Ima have it made in the shade, Ima be so paid
And my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills
Matta fact Im schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good
When I ditch these trainin' wheels

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm sick and tired of ridin' public transportation
Been patient waitin' on my set of wheels
I'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes
In order to get myself some dollar bills
It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes
And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss
My older cousin need some cheddar too
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick
It involves that local corner store
I overheard him say he knew who works there
And whatever they do, dont let the owner know
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change
At least for the summer
And if he dont let me borrow nothin, but ask me what I want
Ima tell him I wanna...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Why can't I walk with a limp mama? won't be no drama
For goodness sakes, Im just a kid
Had to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po'
Like there no remorse for what I did
Gotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets
How some just creep, really just to eat a meal
"I coulda swore it was mine," what I used to tell the po-pos
What I left to rob and steal
Man, I gotta earn for a livin', ain't nobody givin' me nothin'
Find somethin' I love to do
Hmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin'
Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw
Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls
I'm adjustin' to my environment
This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back
Why can't work feel like retirement?
