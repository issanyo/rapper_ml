(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now

Luda!
I Wanna Rock like Pookie, so here comes the New Jack
Ludacris, reincarnated like 2PAC
(Snoop, roll it up!) But you already knew that
Two blunts together like (Luda, where they do that?)
We call 'em torpedoes, high like eagles
Take two puffs and pass, snatch it like Dee-bo
Unc be in the Regal, Luda in the 'Cut
Pull up with a speaker that'll make your woman shake butt
(Say what?)
Hell yeah, I said it
If I your niigga got beef, then I don't really wanna dead it (Nope!)
I'm too cool for school, too tough to bluff
With a Gucci bandana and some jeans with a cuff
(That's enough!)
I let these rappers have it
They don't even compare to when I put out "Phat Rabbit"
So while you're smoking Bobby Brown and losing
We be choking on that 'purp, betting Whitney Houston's like
