I know you want me
I made it obvious that I want you too
So put it on me
Let's remove the space between me and you

Now rock your body, oh
Damn, I like the way that you move
So give it to me
'Cause I already know what you wanna do

Here's the situation, been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, given my reputation
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude

But tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know
That tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know

That tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know
That tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know

You're so damn pretty
If I had a type then, baby, it would be you
I know you're ready, if I never lied
Then, baby, you'd be the truth

Here's the situation, been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, given my reputation
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude

But tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know
That tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know

That tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know
That tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know

Tonight I'm gonna do
Everything that I want with you
Everything that you need, everything that you want
I'm on the hunt, I wanna stunt with you

From the window to the wall
Gotta give you my all
Winter or the summertime
When I get you on the springs, I'mma make you fall

You got that body that make me wanna
Get up on the floor just to see you dance
And I love the way you shake that ass
Turn around and let me see them pants

You're stuck with me, I'm stuck with you
Let's find something to do
Please excuse me
I don't mean to be rude

But tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know
That tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know

That tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know
That tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know

That tonight I'm lovin' you
Yeah, tonight I'm lovin' you
