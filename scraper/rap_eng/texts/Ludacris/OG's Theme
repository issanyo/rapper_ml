[Hook]
(Ah!) West side keep it thuggin' like
After me there will never be another like (Hell yeah!)
Bad hoes, palm trees, bomb weed
Stack cheese, I'm the original (Gangsta!)

[Verse 1]
The first nigga with an attitude
With thirty mil' sold, where the fuck the gratitude?
Huh, I see all these little BG's
Mean muggin' on the screen, tryna be me
Huh, I'm much more than 6-4's
Gun talk, chronic leaves and thick hoes
That's why most of them have come and went
I just recoup, recreate and reinvent
Nigga, welcome to the west coast
We home of the jackers and the best smoke
And ain't no nigga better than Doc Dre, I'm a twenty-year veteran
Bitch I run this whole time zone
'Bout to show these young niggas how to grind homes
I hope you got it while you had the chance
Your run's over, now get ready for the aftermath

[Hook]
