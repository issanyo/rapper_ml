[Nas] Nasir..

[Chorus: Nas]
Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo
We sippin' on Merlot, you ain't got be my girl though
I drop you off at Willoughby and Myrtle
Smash with the Virgo, ain't got to take your shirt off
You seen me convince your homegirl though

[Verse 1: Nas]
Plus she says her life is too hard
She says that she wanna come and build with the God
Promise me that she gon' play her part
Cause what I spit gets straight to her heart
And, she's damn fine, feet Hammertime, damn if I mind
Long as the butt bubblin' back in your waistline
I don't waste time, I gotta get-get on it
Just you and me, two glasses, silver Patronin'
In the club scene where I met Ms. Green Eyes
She walked by askin' me, "Are you Nas?"
Why? "If you was I'd be totally twi"
What's that? "Totally with it, T-W-I"
Haha, well, here I am, yep, I'm the man
Bartender, put a Cosmo in that girl hand
So, here we standin' before I begin
Homegirl made a knot out of the cherry stem
Tongue skills, yeah I like that, now we on the right track
Straight to my Phantom, call Africa Black {*brrrring*}
Ever since then she been yappin' a track
Told her friends, now they hollerin' behind her back, sing!

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo
We sippin' on Merlot, you ain't got be my girl though
I drop you off at Peachtree and Myrtle
Smash with the Virgo, ain't got to take your shirt off
You seen me convince your homegirl though

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Now I was, so fresh and so fly in diamonds
When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shinin'
A little cute thing said, "What's yo' name?"
I put my necklace in her face and told her read the chain
Ooh ooh so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up
BLAOW! Ludacris in the ha-oooh-ouse
The needle hit the record, they was playin' this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was uh-uh-on
Live forever like 'Fame,' let the Leroys dance
While I'm laid back, chillin' in my b-boy stance
Could be a little pop lockin' if your girl's top droppin'
But watch for cockblockin' on my coochie stock options
But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track
Make 'em swip-swap, Nasty N-A-S pass that
Honey in the black cause I'm feelin' her curves
He looked down at what I had and said, 'W-w-word'
Why only serve one when we can serve up two
Then at the bachelor pad, doin' what the Virgos do
And these women so shy but get loud undercover
So we could have sex but I can't be your loverrrrrr
{*DEF breakdown*: buck! buck! buck! buck! buck! buck!}
Ah, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha ah ah-ah SING!

[Chorus: Doug E. Fresh]
Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo (c'mon)
Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo (c'mon)
We sippin on Merlot, you ain't got be my girl though (that's right)
I drop you off at Two-Fifth and Lex-o
Smash with the Virgo, you ain't got take your shirt off
Seen you convince your homegirl though

[Outro: Doug E. Fresh]
They got my voice for the record and my voice for the beat
Virgo crew, baby run the streets
So let's go (let's go) Let's go (for the beat)
Let's go (Virgo crew) It's the Virgo
Let's go (Nasty Nas) Let's go (Ludacris)
And if you don't know, now you know (Doug Fresh)
