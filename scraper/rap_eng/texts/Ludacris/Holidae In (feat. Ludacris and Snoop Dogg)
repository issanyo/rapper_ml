(Intro: Snoop Dogg)
Bomb ass pussy
Ma ooh you got that bomb, know you got it
Ma ooh, you got some bomb ass pussy
Ma I know you got that bomb bomb pussy pussy

(Chorus: Snoop) + (Girl)
(Whatchu doin?) Nothing chillin at the Holidae In
(Who you wit?) Me and my peeps won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?) Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin

(Chorus: Chingy) + (Girl)
(Whatchu doin?) Nothing chillin at the Holidae In
(Who you wit?) Me and my peeps won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?) Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin

(Verse 1: Chingy)
Peeps called me up {*phone ring*} said it's a ho-tel party
Just bring the liquor its already eight shawties
I'm on my way (way) let me stop by the store
Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Road
I'm already blowed, hit third I'm a be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet look like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like wassup
I told em follow me they knew I had it cracking B
One said ain't you that boy that be on BET?
Yeah that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling
Knock on the door I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!
Fuck it then, feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in herre, I heard em whispering
Talking bout that's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr' keep listenin
I ain't come to talk (talk) I ain't come to sit (sit)
What I came for was to find out who I'm gon hit awww shit

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy)

(Verse 2: Chingy)
Ma showed up like what's the hold up?
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, actin silly
The girl said can I be in yo video I'm like yeah!, oh really?
Now she naked stripteasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told OG, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage while I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wildin
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin like they from an island

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy)

(Verse 3: Ludacris)
Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little D and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy)
(Outro: Snoop Dogg)
Yeah, let the party begin, bitch
Ching-a-ling Ling, all the way in St. Louis
My nigga Chingy, Disturbing Tha Peace
Luda, Luda, going hard on you hoes
Yeah bitch, bring four of ya friends
Meet me at the Holidae In
Bring a gang of that Hen, some DSOP
Oh wee, and light that sticky icky
And we gone do the damn thing
Know what I'm talking bout
We gon' disturb the peace right now
Yeah we ain't doing nothing but chillin
And chillin' ain't nuttin'
Know what I'm talking bout, so push the button
You know what's happenin', fa shizzle, uh huh
Yeah bitch, trying to run from this pimpin'
You can't out run the pimpin' bitch, I done told you
You can hide in Atlanta
You can hide in St. Louis
