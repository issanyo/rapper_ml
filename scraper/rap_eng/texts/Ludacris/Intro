Puff it pass it
Puff it pass it
Puff it puff puff puff it
Smokin' cheeba, twisted blisted, lifted puff it pass it
(Get it)
Smokin' cheeba, twisted blisted, lifted puff it pass it
(It's the Battle Of The Sexes)
Smokin' cheeba, twisted blisted, lifted puff it pass it
(Get it)
Smokin' cheeba, twisted blisted, lifted puff it pass it

[Hook: Ludacris]
Now I heard the ladies
They aight but they ain't hittin' on nothin'
Do my fellas run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah!)
Now I heard the fellas
They aight but they ain't hittin' on nothin'
Do my ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah!)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda!
On your mark, get set, put the music in the deck
And turn it up and let the system go
You done heard a lot of people in the past
But you never heard a nigga like this befo'
Ain't nobody better let the records show
If they outta order let a tec just blow
Over the border, I be in Mexico
Throwing it up like an anorexic ho
Anybody thinkin' like they just don't know
Tell 'em that Luda gotta electric flow
Come and see me live and I wreck a show
Sucka niggas better find the exit row
Extra cheese and the extra dough
And I'mma keep goin til the record's broke
So if you don't mean what you say when you spit it on a track
What the FUCK YOU RAPPING FOR?
Women wanna get me and I can't say no
So I get 'em fast and I sex 'em slow
But every now and then it get hectic
They holdin' on tight to a nigga and I gotta let go
Gotta go sign on the X with O's
Wrist gotta shine and my neck just glow
It's a man's world
And all you women I just want the rest to know

[Hook: Ludacris]
Now I heard the ladies
They aight but they ain't hittin' on nothin'
Do my fellas run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah!)
Now I heard the fellas
They aight but they ain't hittin' on nothin'
Do my ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah!)
