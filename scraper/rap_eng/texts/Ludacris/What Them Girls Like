[Intro: Ludacris & Chris Brown]
Luda, SG, Chris Breezy (yup! It's me!)
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (Darkchild)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sean Garrett]
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like

[Verse 1: Ludacris & Sean Garrett]
(Hahaha, Luda!)
Relax and take notes, while I put you up on game
Get a sweeter connect then if I put you up on 'caine
But you should grab yourself a seat and a whiskey double
Because the girls of the world ain't nothin' but trouble
They like a little danger and might not admit it (yeah)
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowin' with swag
And keeps his woman all draped in new Louis Vuitton bags (hey)
And Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to him (yeah)
I like open toe straps, but SG talk to him
I got a whole bunch of girls I'm tryna bring by the crib tonight (yeah)
Better wear your cape 'cause the bringin' that kryptonite (okay)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sean Garrett & (Ludacris)]
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like (I know what you like, baby)
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
(Yeah, we gon' take this to verse 2)
Now some of them want a family, a sense of security (yeah)
A necklace, bracelets and all other types of jewelry
So shop 'til you drop, or 'til it makes you psychotic
Here's a triple black card, it ain't trickin' if you got it (hey)
Others will stay content if you just makin' 'em laugh
Send 'em to the spa, get 'em massaged and bubble bathed
So later on they can dance and throw a drink in they hand
And try every and anythin' they never did with they man, me
So get loose and slide off ya damn garments (hey)
Show 'em who's the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on your body that I'm just tryin' to find
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on your mind (woo!)
An I got plenty more to learn if you's investin' in me (okay)
They don't love for who I am but who I destined to be
And for that, I'd give you everythin' up under the sun
'Cause in the end all the girls just wanna have fun

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sean Garrett & (Ludacris)]
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like (I know what you feel, yeah)
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
They wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen (yeah)
If you can't take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen
'Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick
Gets that ride or die puddin' for that ride or die dick
I say they wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen (yeah)
If you can't take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen
'Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick
Gets that ride or die puddin' for that ride or die dick

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sean Garrett & (Ludacris)]
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like (hahaha, yeah)
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like (they wanna go on vacation and I know it, let's go)
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels (yes)
Hey (they want what they can't have)
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like
Yeah, yeah (haha, yeah)

[Outro: Ludacris & Chris Brown]
Women, I love you all, there's not enough time
Believe that, if your man don't tell you how beautiful you are (hey, yeah)
I'm lettin' you know right damn now, you are beautiful, baby
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
I love women so much, I have one
Luda, Chris Breezy, this too easy
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
SG what up
