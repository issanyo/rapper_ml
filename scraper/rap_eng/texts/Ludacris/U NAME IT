I got cars
Bars
Mars
Czar's
Sometimes I think I'm seeing stars
I ran
Cuz I can
I'm ya biggest fan
My summer break wish is to avoid a suntan
Yah

I got a Ferrari
I'm sorry
I ran out with Kari
The sky is starry
I know you like the jungle let's go on a safari
We can do this
Get through this
With ludacris
And our friend Rufus
Don't be such a doofus
Stop saying you're useless
Stop telling me you're clueless
