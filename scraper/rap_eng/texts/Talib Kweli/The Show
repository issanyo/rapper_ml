[Intro]
Five something in the morning going on six
It's daylight, sunrise time
Time to free yo'self, free your soul, free your mind
Ladies, free that ass, yeah
Coast to coast it's the most, we don't brag and boast
We just leave 'em comatose
It's your boy Talib Kweli

[Verse 1]
Yeah, flow is tight though I got a couple screws loose
It's cuckoo, my rep in this game is bigger than Bruce Bruce
Who you? Your name smaller than five grains of couscous
It's the highest caliber, your caliber is deuce deuce
Shoot, y'all niggas can't hang like a loose noose
I get on stage, niggas in my ear like a Bluetooth
And that's the triple truth Ruth, they lips is loose like
The Se√±or Love Daddy in the bulletproof booth, kuff
My rhymes is full of truth, and the business full of lies
Try to look a Masai kid in his eyes for the flies
And tell him how he fucked up our environment daily
The only thing we know about Africa is from Nas or Belly
But go off like a Hutu or Tutsi, from Rwanda or Burundi
Over drums like Babatunde Olatunji
Saying nigga just to keep our teeth white, like Paul Mooney
Fighting spiritual wars, like the Shi'ite or the Sunni
Yo, our music went from tap dance to the lapdance
Try to get me to sell out and that's a fat chance
You see black faces in my rap pages
Larry Davis, Angela Davis or Ossie Davis

[Hook]
Yeah, welcome to the show, it's Talib Kweli, so amazing
Live from California it's the Madlib Invasion, let's go!

[Verse 2]
This exercise in freedom is called The Liberation
I keep it fly by a process of elimination
When it come to paying the kid, sometimes it's hesitation
Til I make 'em check it in like they got reservations
But there ain't no reservations about copping this
Even though it's free for the people there ain't no stopping this
Popping fresh, caking up, I'm breaking up the, monotonous flow
That can't write or plant life like a botanist grow
A new crop and just roll, it up, blow it out whoa
Excuse the cockiness though, I'm just showing out, no
You can't go without this, now what'chu know about that?
Now what'chu know about... now what'chu know about... {*to fade*}
