This that feeling
(What's happening to love?)
It's that feeling you miss
(I'd like to know)
It's that love, it's that passion
Tone they don't get shit like this no more
What happen to the love?
What happen to the love?
What happen to the?
Reflex, ayyo
Welcome to my longitude and latitude
My attitude is shaping my surroundings
Skyscrapers, public housing
The sheep is running from the sun
The wolves is howling at the moon
It's tragic how you in the street
'Cause you ain't got no avenues
When it come to rapping who's the baddest dude?
(In this world)
You still don't get it, this a recession, what recession?
Dog, we been stressing
Shit been a mess and we been dealing with this depression
Since way back but you ain't got to say that
That's the greatest lesson, slave to our possessions
Greed the devil favorite weapon
Fight to the death, only the greatest left
(In this world)
Let's get it
Lordy, lordy, lordy, lord
I been hustling really, really hard
Get up off my ass start making some moves
Put two and two together start paying my dues
I got to get up for it, stand up in this world
If skills sold truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Lyrically Talib Kweli, Talib Kweli
I get respected by the best MC's
(In this world)
The recipe for my success is one part pain and suffering
Two parts brains and hustling
Sprinkle it over Hi-Tek production
We bubbling like volcanic eruptions
You better buckle in, push the panic button
Come get your momma to tuck you in
You know we did like no other did it
(In this world)
You gots to get with it
In this world
What's happening to love?
I'd like to know
Lordy, lordy, lordy, lord
I been hustling really, really hard
Get up off my ass start making some moves
Put two and two together start paying my dues
I got to get up for it, stand up in this world
Ayo, I grab the mic until my hands develop the calluses
My style is bit, I only see myself with John Malkovich
My grind miraculous, rhyme for slums to palaces
Facing all my challengers, raising the black power fist
Here to eliminate the counterfeit
(In this world)
Add it up it don't amount to shit
I paid my dues kept the receipt for taxes
Although we stack it we stay stuck in the bracket
It's like a straitjacket
My rebel tactics got the planet spinning off it's axis
The devil laughing when you lazy, man, get off your ass
And talent don't mean nothing without all the practice
(In this world)
Lordy, lordy, lordy, lord
I been hustling really, really hard
Get up off my ass start making some moves
Put two and two together start paying my dues
I got to get up for it, stand up in this world
