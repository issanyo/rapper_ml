[Intro - David Banner]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Dead prez
Bet you never thought the truth would come out of Mississippi
Big face, RBG, David Banner

[Verse 1 - David Banner]
I'm from a place
Where you gotta let yo' nuts hang
Where them crackas used to cut your stomach open
Just to let your fuckin' guts hang
Right there in front of the kids
I might as well split your wig
Cause that's just what the massa did
But now I'm the new Nat Turner
Spreadin' something to the kids
Like Sojourner, man, the truth
Fuck a critic, i give the que and doubts will "Woof"
He ain't dead, what a pres
There's a stank up in the Bush
Or a stank up in the White House
Shootin' ball bullshit, man its Jerry Krause
Here in Chicago bullets is high-low
But we always come back, click the bottles
Cock them AK's, bust on KK's
With another one, or the other two, and a Stic-man
Living dead on your shirt like I'm quick-span
You a grown man, nigga stand tall
Don't it hurt cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?
Don't it hurt cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?
Don't it hurt cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?

[Hook]
Country boys, city boys
Cadillac, Rools Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long walk, now that we ridin'

[Verse 2 - M-1]
Yo, niggas is not original, niggas follow the radio
Niggas think if you blow then you gotta be on the TV show
Crackas is hypocritical, crackas would rather shit on you
Then  see you do what they do, they know freedom is powerful
Niggas is very visual, if we see it we think it's true
Very few niggas make a move and even less'll see it through
Crackas make up the chemicals, then they call us the criminals
Crackas make all the loot and we just get the residuals
Niggas would rather shoot on you, crackas will drop a bomb on you
Niggas is having funerals, crackas is having barbecues
Niggas sing the blues that's reminicin' the spiritual
But when you say God is you, niggas ain't really hearing you
Crackas like to capitalize, know crackas will lie
They say if you don't imunize you will probably die
I hate callin' niggas, "niggas" so I'ma take it backwards
But I got no love for whitey, I love callin' 'em "crackas"

[Hook]
Country boys, city boys
Cadillac, Rools Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long walk, now that we ridin'

[Verse 3 - Talib Kweli]
Yeah, I call myself real N-I G-G-A
Cause Kweli be showin' all the flaws in their policies
My philosophies show you that the block is a part of me
Freedom fighter like Bunchy Carter be
It's deep how the street knowledge be
Cause it ran like a code inside of me
It's practical, not scholarly
Now why do I call myself a nigga, you ask me
Who's got my back when the cops harass me
New York, L.A or Cincinnati
Can ride the train or wip the Caddie
When they call you a "nigga" they scared of you
They fearin' you, so actually
If crackas gonna be fearing niggas
Then that's what the fuck I have to be
Now, it's a badge of honor and some say that shit's absurd
It's more than just a word, we flip the shit like it's a bird
Pass it down through generations
Then cuss you out and say it loud
Be the first generation of muthafuckas
To grab our nuts and say it proud
Country niggas or city niggas
2Pac niggas or biggie niggas
In the corridor, floor or door
And all my Mississippi niggas
We connected all throughout
The north, the east, the west, the south
And if a white boy say the shit
He'll still get punched right in the mouth

[Hook]
Country boys, city boys
Cadillac, Rools Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long walk, rather be ridin'

[Outro - Stic.man]
All they got for you is a cell, my nigga
They want you dead or in jail but I rebel, my nigga
In the streets, it's similar to hell, my nigga
But we gonna boss up and live well, my nigga
You see, all they got for you is a cell, my nigga
They want you dead or in jail but I rebel, my nigga
In the streets, it's similar to hell, my nigga
But we gonna boss up and live well, my nigga
