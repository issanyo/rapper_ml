[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Blast from the past
Yo i'm back from the get go
Let's go let's go
Rap is special
Ya'll dudes gas like snaps on the petro
Flashy, like the gun blast in the ghetto
Sparkling like fireworks when we light up the sky
We independent like the 4th of July
Why? We ask a question that you forced to reply to
Shine through the night, through the orange, sky blue
Rhyme for survival, ?? like Big Jay or Skyzoo
Fly with the haikus
A pro with the pro's
Still worse with the verse
Dispersin the hurt to rappers
Gotta work with the nurse
Made it through first
Thank Q-Tip for taking a verse
See how they all up in my mug
Like they takin a purse
Now that's hard, like the population of Rikers
This here easy, it's lightwork

[Hook]


[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Dilla still in here
Kweli he still in here
Abstract on the track
For filming fulfillment's here
Watch ya back boys
There's culture vultures everywhere
Walking the calm streets
Thinking that theirs peace in there
Draow, they blind sided up in
They creepin in
After the rush I'm drinking
Ice quarter waters to sustain
For the long haul
Advice is a order
My vertical up that
No way on the way back
Competition, i eat that
I'll get sneaker contract
I'll mary a vixon
She'll come with the tricks and
She'll take all my mansions
And all of my riches
And leave me with the flatscreen
And my new game device
And my little black book, my boys
And my brand new life
Now im playing on my T.V. screen
Beating niggas down looking
Bruce Banner green
Lookin at the high score
Do you want more?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Check, Niggas say my flow is bananas
Yes flow's sicker then another nigga
Looking up another man's ass
Yes you can have the mayonaise
Bust your head and bang bitches
Up they cope and cabanas
And leave with yo bitch
My niggas will lay you out on a canvas
My clique consists of red and blue flags
We full of bandanas
Thorough like desperados, Antonio Banderas
My D crash floors, diamonds, them shits
As clear as a sunny day not a cloud in a sky
My nigga, whereas, yours look like
"Da da da, skippity boop" period
I'm so serious, flows makin hoes delirious
You wanna find out?
Bitch jump on my dick if you curious
J-Dilla the godfather of the funk dubious
While you niggas think you the cell
I be the cell nucleus
You's the stupidest
If you think that you can ever contest the kid
Get outta here with ya groupie ass
