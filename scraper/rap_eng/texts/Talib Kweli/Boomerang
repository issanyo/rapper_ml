[Hook: Cory Mo]
Count it up, never cease, keep it movin’ man
Roll it up, pass it round like a boomerang
Turn it up, real music’ll never die
Quality over quantity, homie it’s only right

[Verse 1: NIKO IS]
Been unimpressed with some of the best, but nonetheless
It’s subjective, just maybe just my perspective
Colours is the collective, and wanna know somethin’ son?
Under covers I could detective, hear me
A logical cool dude with a tropical pool view
The crew makin’ it classic like the school flew
Shoot for the moon with a tool I shoot pool
Only fools follow rules, we make em’, we create ‘em
[?]
Makin’ movies with music but [?] ain’t Cuba man
I’m just movin’ around like a boomerang
Try to look away, it’s like a right hook from Sugar Ray
Dodgin’ the [?]
It’s magic like Earvin and [?]
I meet with big fish, boy surf and the turf
It’s God and geometry, I’m observin’ the Earth

[Hook]

[Verse 2: K’Valentine]
Yo, I get it brewin’ like I’m hot water
Surprise you like they brought you food that you did not order
Some of these people won’t receive you or believe you
Til a nigga outta town come in a peep you, grab a spot for you
Listenin’, I’m listenin, I’m listenin’
I’m getting they attention and got all these niggas whisperin’
And all [?] that they witnessin’
They judge me on my morals and my vows but still they missin’ ‘em
They missin’ ‘em
I’m sayin’ what they sayin’ I just speak it different
And fuckin’ with the gift [?] in the instant
Little cutie from Chicago that’s an understatement
I’m the definition of a female emcee underrated
Amazing with the storytellin’
Take a nigga and upgrade him like I'm Tori Spelling
Chicken [is a?] watermelon
Cause I’m a black queen
I’m here to bring that real shit back to the rap scene

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Vultures of the culture, I see them eating the strange fruit
It’s brain food for zombies they wash it down with a strange brew
They’ll bite until they change you, hopin’ you grow some fangs too
Just to remain, you gotta find you an angel
What a quiet singer I wanna thank you
A young [?] kingdom’ll save you
The God particle and the cord that come from the navel
Ferocious when defendin’ the home, results is fatal
Approaching the gaze wrong facing off with a face on
Sex sure to keep this safety on with the lace on
Based on my experience you niggas straight [?]
Swelter in America, stay warm, let’s pray for ‘em
Need to bow your head in submission
Say it to your face, no sub-dissin’
Never sell out for the cash so my money good
If money talk, my shit be tellin’ everyone they should

[Hook]
