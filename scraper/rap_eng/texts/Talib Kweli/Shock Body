Yeah, shock body like

Uh, yeah, BK MC, like what you gonna do when we come through when you
Woo, yeah, come on

[Verse 1]
Watch how Talib Kweli Greene do it
What I bring to it
You hear the theme music
My rhymes' are life support, dog, breathe to it
Rhymes are bright, the sunshine beams to it
Stop haters in their tracks like high beams
Watch the movement you was at the crime scene screaming "I ain't do it"
But, I seen through it, it's obscene how I spew it
Martin Luther King had a dream to it, people cling to it
I seen your momma lean to it in a green Buick
Wack niggas get passed over so much they seem Jewish
Better leave and do it now or seem foolish
This music I bleed to it, I raise my seeds to it
I MC with the truest in the game
I stay hungry like I'm the newest in the game
And stay hot like I'm bluish with the flame
You heard the truth when it came
And you knew it was the name that you couldn't pronounce
Now I'm all up in your mouth
My people all up in the house and we calling you out
Y'all niggas crying, what you bawling about
This shit is down like we chalking you out
Hey yo, that's what I'm talking about

[Hook]
(Girl)
Look up in the sky recongnize it's sunshine (la, la's cont'd)
(Kweli)
Yeah, what you gonna do when we come through when you
(Girl)
How can you deny when it's right in your eyes
(Kweli)
Shock body, rock the block party
Like what you gonna do when we come through when you
(Girl)
Look up in the sky recognize it's sunshine
(Kweli)
Come on and, come on and
Kweli like what you gonna do when we come through when you
(Girl)
How can you deny when it's right in your eyes
(Kweli)
Yeah, come on

[Verse 2]
Check the writing skills forever coming tight with the quill
You sound like you liking the thrill
Or filling the pipe with the the krill
YOu must be smoking like the spliff we like to light when we build
Out of respect for the dead we let our Heinekens spill
Cats taking Vicodin pills to numb the pain that they feeling
Pertaining to stealing my rhymes finding their brains on the ceiling
I'm blowing their minds wide open when I'm flowing divine
Hey yo my whole style banging like I'm throwing up signs
Niggas get cut like I saw someone I know in the line
I live life to the fullest cause I know I could die
Right now, I don't believe I know and decide
My fate so just go on and ride, when I'm goin' goodbye
You gonna see a rainbow in the sky
And my momma's face glowing with pride
My first born held it down and through my baby's soul I survive
Put your hands in the air and let me know you're alive
I love this game y'all, I ain't even going to lie
I can see you all rocking cause you know when it's live, word

[Hook]

Repeat chorus
