[Talib Kweli]
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-Madlib invasion - music please!

[Res]
Music, it makes me feel so good
Early in the morning it makes me, feel like I'm floating
And I'm strollin
There are times that, the music, it just, it just lets me unwind
I said
Music makes you love, it make you feel, it make it true, it makes it real
It can make you move
It can make you kneel and pray or stare into yourself until you hear the voice of God
And I, hear the voice inside
It's a celebration, yeah
It's a celebration, I am music

[Male singer]
There are times I wanna give up
Then I remember this gift, that God has given to me
He's living through me
You see his vision through me...
Music make you love, it make you feel, it make it true, it make it real
It can make you move
It can make you kneel and pray or stare into yourself until you hear the voice of God
And I, hear the voice inside

[Res]
It's a celebration, yeah yeah
It's a celebration, that never let me down
It makes me feel so good
Early in the morning it makes me, feel so like I'm just floatin
And strollin, there are times that
The music just lets me unwind
MUSIC~!
