[Intro: Talib Kweli]
Life, loving
That's what we do, uh
That's what we, that's what we do, uh
That's what we, that's what we do, yeah
Tracks by 9th Wonder
That's what we, that's what we do, uh
Celebrate life, yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Play your position, monopolizer like cable vision
Cause when you're living in hell, heaven's a greater mission
For those addicted to jail home is a greater prison
I slay the rhythm, it's lyrical turntablism
Looking for that scratch tryna make a living
Like Roc Raida, no imitating the way he did it
The Grandmaster, hands faster than advanced data
The fans have to give it up, they in the stands clapping
For the X-Ecutioners, we start with Rob Swift
Mista Sinista next then it's Total Eclipse
Hold on Roc Raida 'bout to go on
Perfect timing, combine it like Voltron
Compete with the beat juggler you leak from the jugular
187 like Snoop, a deep cover bro
Until the day I expire, turn to vapours
Paying tribute to one of the greatest, Roc Raida, rest in peace

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
Sending this one out to those who passed on
Let me tell you about the legacy they passed on
Nah, it ain't a sad song
We're just celebrating life homie, that's all
Sending this one out to those passed on
Let me tell you about the legacy they passed on
Nah, it ain't a sad song
We're just celebrating life homie, that's all
That's all

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
You say you love hip hop, but are you still involved?
Some of this real life shit it don't appeal to blogs
You gotta love them while they're here, they tryna kill us off
The way you pray to God is listening to Dilla dawg
Jay Dee the J Dilla, you can't kill him
Started with Slum Village and Amp Fiddler
Used to carry .45's in his arm, word to Ma Dukes
Fan-Tas-Tic Volume 1 and 2, that's a gospel
He fed us Donuts from the hospital bed
The doctor said he gotta chill, he got a lot on his chest
Not gonna rest until we get it off, he hit it off with Madlib
The rhymer was as nice as the beats, The Shining classic
The flow was so pyroplastic such artistry was accomplished
Harmony so unpacked RIP to Baatin
You know the sound of the Motor Town always hold it down
We know the style before we toast it up and pour it out

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
Sending this one out to those who passed on
Let me tell you about the legacy they passed on
Nah, it ain't a sad song
We're just celebrating life, homie that's all
Sending this one out to those passed on
Let me tell you about the legacy they passed on
Nah, it ain't a sad song
We're just celebrating life homie that's all
That all? That all

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Some of these babies out here don't have mothers
To spoil them and so they're loyal to a flag color
Ain't no real ones left, this the last of us
I'm staying underground, king like I'm Chad Butler
The discography, the chronicles of living in poverty
How to get it and flip it and pimp properly
Shout out to Bun B, shout out to Mama C
Pimp C ain't no product of marketing
He was sort of a pimp Socrates
We got to chopping up philosophy, his mind operated at top velocity
Gettin' thrown to Sweet Jones and my grill is on
The way I rock is so trill, pocket full of stones
You keep throwing fake diamonds on your neck and wrist
Take that monkey shit off, come around and pimp
Realest nigga round this bitch, nobody did it better
Still with us, in our heart, you're gonna live forever

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
Sending this one out to those who passed on
Let me tell you about the legacy they passed on
Nah, it ain't a sad song
We're just celebrating life homie, that's all
Sending this one out to those passed on
Let me tell you about the legacy they passed on
Nah, it ain't a sad song
We're just celebrating life homie that's all

[Verse 4: Add-2]
Yo, this is for you and I
Once was dying to live, now we're living to die
Looking for real estate, wanna live in the sky
Heard the prices were high, watching your soul rise
Leaving it all behind, I'm reading on your mind
Receiving all your lies, you wear it like a disguise
The fear is in your eyes, love is still in your heart
But the lust inside of my mind had led me into your inner thighs
Now you got feeling fine, back to you being mine
Your exes fall back, to the back of the line
You search your horoscope tryna find you some type of sign
That we are meant to be
But you know deep inside I'm the reason you're getting high
The reason you drink and drive
The one that's making you cry, the one that's drying your eyes
I say I got your back but never by your side
Your love is slowly dying, slowly dying, slowly dying...
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
