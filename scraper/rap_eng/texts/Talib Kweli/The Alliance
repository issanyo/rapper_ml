[Talib Kweli #1: Verse]
Rocking with that Break Science
Break Science musicians create an alliance
Take them higher just to jumble with face alliance
Wow see the people making a smile guilty as charge with innocent a face of a child
An Eminem 8 style like Eminem in 8 Mile
Fuck the world  to penetrate coming from the blocks step on a crack now
Still on a growth spurt to dial from the Chemical Lab
Break Science keep a healthy living keep the tech higher
We do what we do to lying friend let me tell you what relevant is I Really don't give a f-f-u-u-c-c-k-k like a selling a chick
You can bless when I fell off a cliff
What did I go to jail for fuck war that's a hell of a beg what you did

[Talib Kweli #2: Verse]
Break Science you're the top off the break sirens
You whack kill that noise to make silence
Spill from the mouth because I ain't got a filter to struggle the mic
Make it stronger with that probably kill you
The kid don't care when you are better than this
I gotta tell you believe that shit i gotta sell you
Real records Nas real you because you don't look familiar
This track fits like a souped up dude buckler like a tailor
Innovated stimulate you like a fortune-teller
I roll with winners I don't accept failure
No No I don't accept failure
