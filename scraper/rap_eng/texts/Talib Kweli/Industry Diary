[Res:]
Is it time to walk away
I felt the hurt i felt the shame
Now i know its up to me
To play the game or let it be
I go back and forth
Tryin to decide
What im gon make of me
Do i turn my back on the industry
And live a life of normalcy?
Like a normal girl
Make a normal world
Work at the gallery on wall street
Then in the summertime hit the jersey shore
Like i never been to ??? beach
Spend my ends on cheap souviners like salt water taffy
Then hit the ???, sip a drink and play the nickle machines
Wake up every mornin
Gotta get my child ready for school
Gotta wash him up, i gotta make his food
I gotta feed the dog, i gotta wash him too
Drive to my nine to five
Gotta punch the clock for eight hours
Knowin that im only makin seven fifteen, a fuckin hour
I must be crazy, they probably think im lazy
My old manager askin me
What have i done lately huh?
I been workin out, yea, keepin my body lookin tight
I done changed my look up
Took the braids out
Im rockin a fro that i really like
And i live in LA, party all the time
At forty-deuce im gettin drunk and high
Start a new group called fleetwood black
I swore you knew about that
I play guitar, i play the drums
I been writin songs till im numb
And im drivin my shitty car
To hang out with stars, like Lil Jon
Pharrell's on deck and he's writin me all types of songs
And Dr. Dre's a fan, but so what?
I've been workin so hard and so long
Everybody that hears my voice
They tell me they fall in love
And everybody swears they know how
My label fucked up
But are they wrong? [wrong]
Or are they right? [right]
When will i get it right? [get it right]
Are they wrong? [wrong]
Or are they right? [right]
When will i get it right? [get it right]
Are they wrong? [wrong]
Or are they right? [right]
When will i get it right? [get it right]
Are they wrong? [wrong]
Or are they right? [right]
When will i get it right? [get it right]

[Talib Kweli:]
This life of an artist
Is the life i was promised
Workin twice as hard as the next man regardless
Of the job
Its a labor of love i started
This mic is my heart
I live the life of a target
They build you up just to tear you down
Cor-porate clows fear your sound
They know it's the truth
And expose they lies
When you close your eyes
You wish you were a star
People wanna judge you when they sittin from afar
Backseat driver sittin in the car
Know what i would do if i was you but you not me
You could never do what i do nigga got me?
Flow off beat and they callin it sloppy
Flow on beat and they callin it poppy
Truth, im the truth, cats spell in the booth
My career is the proof they be callin it cocky
From the bottom headin straight to the top
While you wait for a flop so you can take my spot
This life is so addictive
Get your prescription to fit your description
At the party while you drink it all in
Wake up in the mornin on the brink of fallin
Warfare runnin in place
When you runnin for the cake you be runnin from faith
And its funny how money so dangerous they keep it in a safe
Showboat niggas like to keep it in your face
Go out they way to impress these city hoes
Cheaper than the sensual seduction video
Really though
I know my worth
Been headin towards this moment since the day of my birth
These are thoughts that i write in my diary
Smoke to get by keep my eyes fiery
Yea, the life of an artist
Workin twice as hard as the next man regardless
Of the job its a labor of love i started
This mic is my heart i live the life of a target
They build you up just to tear you down
Cor-porate clows fear your sound
They know it's the truth
And expose they lies
When you close your eyes
You wish you were a star
