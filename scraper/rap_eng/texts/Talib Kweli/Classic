[Intro]
[M.E.D.] Uhn, yeah, uh-huh...
[Talib Kweli] Rock with it, rock with it
Rock with it and
Clap your hands and
Roll with it, roll with it, roll with it and
Rock with it, rock with it, rock with it and
[M.E.D.] It's natural, baby
Uh, M.E.D

[Verse 1: M.E.D.]
Yeah
Came so easy when I wrote this
Reason they hate so hard... Man
Trade call cause their hand they fail all
We separate weak from the strong
Now your lawful golddiggers never let girls evolve
Separate love from the horn
Street methods, reflection and there’s no face
Beef hard to swallow with no taste
At least I die on my feet, ain’t defeat
No coward dead with a heartbeat
In park fleet hood in the hood with K Ridge
Madlib connect land like bay bridge
Same kids didn’t hoop a loop this (What'up?)
Can’t stop hip hop since ‘86 (Represent)
Ask you chick what’s her favorite disc
Don’t hate when she mentioned this shit
Classic

[Hook]
Timeless everlasting music next generation passing
Hear melodies feel memories flashing
Tears to the laughing
Classic
Blast through years still blasting
J Dill, 2Pac, time traveling
For the masses, black and latins
Turn it up
React with classics

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Life (How ya' doin'?)
It’s a honor and pleasure
I treasure being the voice
Of the children of the Lesser
God gonna test ya'
You gotta survive
When they apply the pressure
And give you a shock like a lie detector
Where were you when they were passing out Karma
Don’t let me black out on you
I'm blasting outta space
Like the astronaut farmer
Cause the inner city grios is obsessed with the kilos
Homie your range is shorter than Danny Devito
So ain't nobody planning the sequel
Jumping jet
Could land on your ego
We go
Next level like Show and A. G
You get the picture clearer than slow motion on the HD TVs
I witnessed the death of the CD
Liberate yourself from that format and be free
These dudes try to be new instead of classic
You represent your block, my crew is intergalactic
And we, and we...

[Hook]

[Outro: M.E.D.]
Material, yeah, yeah, yeah
Material, uh-huh Classic
Uh-huh, Material...
