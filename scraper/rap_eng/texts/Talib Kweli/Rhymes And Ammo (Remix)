[Chorus: Black Thought] + {Talib Kweli}
A'yo when I say pump that, y'all say shit up
Pump that! {Shit up} Pump that! {Shit up}
When I say stand up, y'all say get up
Stand up! {Get Up} Stand up! {Get Up}
When I say rise up, y'all say now
Rise up! {Now} Rise up! {Now}
When I say lick a shot, say blaow
Lick a shot! {Blaow!) Lick a shot! {Blaow!}

[Black Thought]
Everybody on they jawns
Cartoons is hardcore porn
It ain't no afterschool paper routes, mowin lawns
Kids got backpacks full of yayo and heron
Coming to school shootin up the auditorium
Aiyyo its anthrax maniacs on the TV
The least of y'all worries should be Thought's CD
The chairman of the board coppin twice weekly
They done caught the minister with a pork B-L-T
If my shit ain't hot, it probly try to drive me
Psyhce, its somethin I can never let myself see
Can't see, I'm thorough-bread, nothin fancy
The maker, no matter what the circumstance be
It's the principle, pillowcase full of nickel
Smacked like I'm ?, leave him crippled
Keep talkin greasey I'ma big lip you
Aiyyo your man'll can get slid with you
You and the squad takin to galoshes
I hold the engineer for hostage
And spit from a dirty cartridge
It's L for whoever try to front on Thought's shit
I'm sendin them goons to your mom's apartment
Yo!

[Chorus: Black Thought] + {Talib Kweli}
A'yo when I say pump that, y'all say shit up
Pump that! {Shit up} Pump that! {Shit up}
When I say stand up, y'all say get up
Stand up! {Get Up} Stand up! {Get Up}
When I say rise up, y'all say now
Rise up! {Now} Rise up! {Now}
When I say lick a shot, say blaow
Lick a shot! {Blaow!) Lick a shot! {Blaow!}

[Black Thought]
Aiyyo, countries at war, little kids cry rape
Goddammit, the ghetto is a Planet Of The Apes
Massive meltdown bringing the red tape
The cinder blocks ?shoos? at the bottom of the lake
I'm from the city of the sinners state of the art
You should know book and the pen for making a mark
I love the game clobber lane hit him with the gutter slang
Your brother's insane but I'm another thang
The track bang like your baby mother very hardly
To put it to y'all chumps so corny
My name: Black Thought the one person army
All the intellectuals and the thugs adore me
My lyrical range from complex to strange
It's wrecking your brain when the rhymes ? to change
Hip hop fiends tapping their arm to catch a vein
MC's scared to death wishing I never came

[Chorus: Black Thought] + {Talib Kweli}
A'yo when I say pump that, y'all say shit up
Pump that! {Shit up} Pump that! {Shit up}
When I say stand up, y'all say get up
Stand up! {Get Up} Stand up! {Get Up}
When I say rise up, y'all say now
Rise up! {Now} Rise up! {Now}
When I say lick a shot, say blaow
Lick a shot! {Blaow!) Lick a shot! {Blaow!}

[Talib Kweli]
Kweli, sittin back in the cut like Reese (Come on!)
In a constant peace, call me fantastic like I cut the grease
Baracudas movin and canoein sippin amaretto
I'm a ruler of my temple, what I do to instrumentals
Instrumentals is the development of these niggas mentals
Tears in your eyes like this moment is sentimental
Your fundamentally floored, philosophically bored
Disturbed like the eighth floor of your hospital ward
You've GOT to appoint niggas to raise the bar (Yes)
Muslims praise Allah, Christians praise the God
Rastas, they say Jah
They find a way to rhyme with the pallet like fine wine
And make you say ahhh
Guess who's back? The game needed improvement (Uh)
Can't fit the bullshit no more, you sound stupid
I'm a shark in the water with constant movement
Influenced by music since a truant yo
This is how we do it yo

[Chorus 2x: Black Thought] + {Talib Kweli}
When I say pump that, y'all say shit up
Pump that! {Shit up} Pump that! {Shit up}
When I say stand up, y'all say get up
Stand up! {Get Up} Stand up! {Get Up}
When I say rise up, y'all say now
Rise up! {Now} Rise up! {Now}
When I say lick a shot, say blaow
Lick a shot! {Blaow!) Lick a shot! {Blaow!}

[Black Thought] + {Talib Kweli}
Lick a shot! {Blaow!} (Repeat 16x)
