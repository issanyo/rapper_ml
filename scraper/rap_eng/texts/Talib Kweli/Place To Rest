[Verse 1:  Kaz Money]
Looking at the map then i spin the globe, watching it spin as colors combine I can see myself land anywhere and it's home
Neither here nor there, still singing my song
I sing to any ear that relates and it won't be long till I'm asked to relocate like,  your passports out of date right
Pack another bag put another nap sack on my back catch a cab cuz I gotta catch another flight tonight
Be this way till the day I die too white for black too black for the white
Scrape the bottom of the melting pot when you got this many fucking sides combined
I believe it's, harder when you got No allegiance borders mean nothing when you're leaving constantly got to stamp another page another visa fuck
I been there done that, modern day nomad
No land no helping hand now which God do I pray to I was never programmed
Which culture should I identify with, when they ask where I'm from I go silent
Pick a side pick a tyrant pick a place to rest when I arrive in
Another form to fill
Another box to tick
It seems the same when change is constant fuck this shit

[Hook: Spark Master Tape]
With my last breath i ask this
Where the graves in the city i land in
Where the fuck ya'll gonna burn these bastards
We gonna ride till we all find us a home
Die till we all find us a home
They gon have to burn us if they don't want our return
Weapon by the window we just waiting for our turn
They must kill us all and throw locks up on our urns
See the souless never die multiply we flood the earth
Swoup

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Yeah, the prison industrial complex got a nigga stuck in the projects
Niggas sound hard in the ear be clear its just for the context
Running from the monsters to make a nigga less than honest taking up space in your conscious (ugh)
Compassion is seen as a weakness,  you try to take advantage of my kindness let me remind ya
I come country called earth on planet called brookly New York fuck whatever you thought
You can catch me in the hood like New Ports
Yup I be pimping this game like Too Short fuck whatever you thought
Colors of the culture and the name of the crew
(Ugh) and we breaking through gotta make it through
Try to catch up but it's too late for you
Wherever I lay my hat is my home so a hat on my dome when I'm known to roam
Picture me in every city a like a travelling gnome
From the sty to dubai with the travelling song
Passport of an American movement from my shoulders to my ear like the demons and the sherif bibs
Been everywhere you never been
Going everywhere you never went

[Verse 3: P Storm]
They know, They know Ima rep this city till I rest In the clouds with a halo
They say no, they know that they will never accept one that look like Kato
But I never I been a afraid tho
No matter what they call me no matter they label
Everything just cease to exist when I read of the list, what I bring to the table
A little more than a fork and a spoon what I bought for these goons and they just abuse it Who woulda thought and they thought and assumed and consume on the fumes on what they thought was music
But this is life...but this is life
Stuck in a place that I call my home but it don't claim me can it get more right
Home where the heart is can I say regardless all I'm looking for is a place for my carcass
Somewhere to park it
Somewhere underground and I'm bound homie don't get me started
Cause all I'm looking for is a place to rest Somewhere just to bury me right after death

[Bridge: Spark Master Tape] x2
They gon have to burn us if they don't want our return
Weapon by the window we just waiting for our turn
They must kill us all and throw locks up on our urns
See the souless never die multiply we flood the earth

[Verse 4: Swerte]
Im ready, give me this life
Tho I Dont i know which point is right
Comin in late, where do i fit
Sinking all my relationships
Nothing lasts  im tied to a rock
In a hard place cus a dream dont stop
For a call on the phone in a room
Reading books all alone
Cus i learn  how to fly when i walk on my own
And we all travelling
Looking for home
Lost connections, stop and listen
But we move on
Where are you from?
Where are you from?
See it doesn't even matter
When i hear its chatter
No mother for a tongue
So i run to these new places
Missing these new faces
Building in the dark
To the pounding of my heart
Tryna fill in the spaces
Living in motion im open to changes
Hoping these strangers make new neighbors
Got me a dog so i got a best friend
For any moment of failure
So i close my eyes and i breathe deeply to the sounds of my flight calling
No surprise im a keep moving till im placed in a coffin
And it happens often
No trace forgotten
Im at home in an alien space
Where a difference makes us common
