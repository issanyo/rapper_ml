("Hearing these melodies") *scratched*

[Verse 1: Frank Nitt]
Okay, okay, alright
I'ma get it tight, it's only right, it's me and you
And I will never underestimate the things that you've been through
Ring around the wack dude, steady getting played
You laying the wedding plans, he planning on getting laid
So hi, how you doing? How your momma doing? Nice to meet you
Seems like you need a meal, I would like to treat you
And we can discuss the wrong and the right way
Or we can get smashed of off Hennessy and OJ
Okay, you taking off your Dolce and Gabanna
And I ain't even ask, don't mean I don't wanna
Start in the bed, end up in the shower
But first let me give you these flowers

[Chorus: Niko Gray]
You give me flowers so I can fill the hours of the night my powers far and high
A sweeter song, my eyes are now devouring the light like a spiral come alive
You give me flowers of life giving me love and lullabies made up of the sky
And every minute, every hour, I devour the light like a spiral come alive
You give me flowers
You give me flowers

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
The most powerful lotus flower devour me by the hour
Got me open, got me zoning, she smoking me like a sour
I'm hoping to give her dower, honor her with the moolah
From dating and making rumors to baby showers and doulas
Consume her with my passion, she match it, it's so special
Whenever she take a step, she get showered in rose petals
On my King Jaffe Joffer, black Don Quixote
Swinging like Devante on my Mr. Belafonte
My group with Dante inspired Phonte and Big Pooh
The way my bella move poetic like big beaucoup
I love your fragrance, it's plush, and plus your touch my favorite
Vanessa Williams on the poster in my mother's basement

[Chorus: Niko Gray]
You give me flowers so I can fill the hours of the night my powers far and high
A sweeter song, my eyes are now devouring the light like a spiral come alive
You give me flowers of life giving me love and lullabies made up of the sky
And every minute, every hour, I devour the light like a spiral come alive
You give me flowers
You give me flowers

[Verse 3: Illa J]
Yea I give you flowers, 'cause I touch your powers
So I sign my initials on the line, dismiss all my chicks on the sideline
'Cause I want to feel mine, electricity aside
You a love conductor, you feel that energy and so do I
But only I keep it real, I wanna be your only guy
And I'm cool we can't be homies but I just wanna be your homie
'Cause I'm home alone and I think you're the perfect person for me
Don't we have amazing chemistry but you send me on a [?]
Read between those lines, ghost lines
'Cause I can't say what I feel
You know how keeping it real goes wrong
I have to rewrite this whole song
Feelings were too revealed, revealed
So that's why I sent you flowers with this letter sealed, "Love John"

[Chorus: Niko Gray]
You give me flowers so I can fill the hours of the night my powers far and high
A sweeter song, my eyes are now devouring the light like a spiral come alive
You give me flowers of life giving me love and lullabies made up of the sky
And every minute, every hour, I devour the light like a spiral come alive
You give me flowers
You give me flowers
