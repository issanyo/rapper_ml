[Intro: Asheru]
Wassup, this is Asheru
And the master of horror is about to terrify ya'll whack ass DJs
With this banger straight from the boiler room

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
A lot of cat’s like to get on the microphone and front
They say they rollin' in paper like they rammin a blunt
Tell ya how much the sound, scared of the month
If the man tell you to jump, you do it
We never let a man take advantage of us
You get props off the diamonds you rented
I get my props off the rhymes I invested
Cuz I spoke my mind and I meant it
Like toppa with a bow tie, Kick your ass with class
And we still take it to Brooklyn, when we ready to splash
Me and Hi-Tek got ya ready to blast, and we're ready to last
I stay hungry like I’m ready to fast
Married to the movement like I'm Betty Shabazz, the rhyme veteran
Lack a real bitch right now like a Lesbian Thespian
Since they let me in the back, I've been droppin' jewels
Plugged in like pasta noodle, Stay fresh and clean like hospitals
In world the crisp pockets and wallets and wrist watches
Did you ever think the wrist is watching you, that's why the cop's stoppin' you
Nigga please, they can track you down anywhere
The cell phone transmitting radiation in your ear
Your two way is way too new and obsolete next year
Navigational systems show you how to get there
If you ain't think about how you got here, do you know where you are?
C’mon, what happened, back in the day they used to follow the stars
You spillin too much, gotta catch it in bottles and jars
And makes MCs eat their words and swallow their bars
Oh my god…

[Hook: Talib Kweli & (Samples)]
Kweli and I’m (Hip Hop)
Me and my man came out
Put it down, c'mon
Mos def and (Hip Hop)
(Ideally when I pull the pin out)
(I hope you listening)
Black Star is (Hip Hop)
We about to do this, all over again
We keep Hip Hop (Hip Hop)
(Dub Floyd)

[Verse 2: Mos Def]
It’s me (who?)
Mos, the most beautiful
Plain and unusual
Black Star, rockin' with that hot shit you movin' to
Massively musical, that frequency you tune into
That top of the Dao shit, that ‘you don't know my style’ shit
It's what the Brooklyn niggas stay on file with
No matter what the scene or surroundings
You either um, on the grind or loungin'
I'm live in any state that I'm found in
Myself and all the niggas I'm down with
This announcement gon' keep the ghetto bouncing
Where people find pleasure and measurements are ounces
Midwest, big stress and small houses
Down South slangin' the twang mispronounced and
East on that foul shit, West, they straight clownin'
Black Star got this shit they all get down with
Don't tell me duke on a scene I've been around in (Mos Def)
Well respected on your block I am the mojo worker with the hottest hand
I keep it cookin' like pots and pans
I know that haters got hey Glocks and scams
But they simply can't stop my clan
It's mighty Mos and super Kwe', my man
Black Star, my fam
About to move on the hearts of man and till the small hearted hearts expand
Brooklyn, they gon' stalk the champ and I spit flame that's off the jam
Heavy hittin' shit across the fence
In other words I'm off the wall with this
I drop heavy jewels and ornaments
That make ‘em shine a little more with this…

[Hook: Talib Kweli & (Samples)]
