[Verse 1]
Yes, you the girl of my dreams
They saying our love not clean
We gonna rise above these things
I’m loving our color scheme
All my dreams are black and white previews of the afterlife
Grim reaper trying to grab my life
But I’m walking right past that light
I don’t know what you see in me
I don’t know, I’m just being me
Say “I love you” frequently
Partner in crime, P in C
You tuned to my frequency
Got your boy all weak in the knee
Always bringing out the freak in me
Happens when you speak to me

[Verse 2]
Page by page, I wrote the story of your heart
And day by day, you played the lead role
And I knew the end from the start
And I was in complete control
And I felt you fall in love and fall back out
Synchronized as I'd walk away and turn right back around
It's not a matter of love, it's just a matter of time
It's not a matter of love
But is this your dream or mine?

[Verse 3]
While you sleep, I’m opening your door
I’m walking across your carpet
I’m sitting by your bedside right now
To see if I can touch your hair a while
If I could make you stare right back right now, you’d see through me
I’m speeding up your heart from right inside your soul
Just lay back now, don’t you know I’m bending your space?
I’m turning back time
But is this your dream or mine?
Is this your dream or mine?
Is this your dream or mine?
Is this your dream or mine?
Is this your dream or mine?

[Verse 4]
Pendulum swings, soaked in what this medicine brings
Hope is a denizen's dream
Cut rope and enemies sink
But what if that's me in the mirror?
Another cold day, lost touch with the dreamer
Touch the scenery
It’s eating me alive
Pitfalls, each one seems worse than the last
Reversing the past
I keep falling deep until it’s full circle when I laugh
I only saw the best in you
Now in my mind I’m undressing you, caressing you
Whatever’s left of you until I come to rest with you
I see this and more
Is this my dream or yours?
Is this my dream or yours?
Is this my dream or yours?
