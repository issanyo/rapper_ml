[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
It's what it is
Murk with a merciless verse
Earths surface is cursed
Curtains for your kids
Just pull the trig
Hot metal from the barrell of the bow and arrow just pops off your wig
Locks off the hinge
Top of the the 10
I'm the one not to be confused with none of them
It's an actual fact
It's not an act, it's been proven indeed
Now blow some weed and motherfucker keep it moving
You on that last shit not knowing that it's outta here
What I write be makin rappers bite like Vladimir
My whole layout is way out the stratosphere
And right there thats what Lebron left the Cavaliers
Pure 'caine man nothing but the ???? here
I get on the mic, and turn into a gladiator
On site burning your type like the radiator
Planet Asia, whack nigga eradicator

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
You gotta let these niggas know every so often
They always pick the quickest route to they own coffin
Nigga shut the fuck up when grown folks talkin
Nigga shut the fuck up when grown folks talkin
I get it big my reputation is so enormous
Pure as the driven snow the flow is so gorgeous
Nigga shut the fuck up when grown folks talkin
Nigga shut the fuck up when grown folks talkin

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Yeah
Put two up in the air so everyone can smoke
I rock with the double-dutch but I ain't jumpin rope
You try to hate it but you love it though
Kill it with the gutter flow
State of emergency like ????
Get in my way and I run em over slowly
Back it up if you swear you run the show
Will that ever be so?
Well I don't really know, but everyone can hope
Alter boys grow up and want apologies from the pope
Nope, it ain't gonna happen
Yo you know the song
You can't always get what you want like the rolling stones
I'm like the drugs in Mick Jagger's body
You know the poem
I use the words as my sword to defeat the jabberwocky
Can't no rapper stop me
Picture me snitchin like police and theives is unthinkable like Alicia Keys
Now who police police, we disturb the peace
Like ludacris & Chaka so they shoot the coppers, blocka

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Planet Asia]
This is black belt
Jim Kelly in the phantom
Afro shinin' from sheen
I spit fire to make the track melt
To make man, woman, and child bow ????
Four finger ring, gold chain marine?
Try to scheme and get blown to smithereens
Outta mind niggas swine like Jimmy Dean
And I'll be damned if you play me like a jelly bean
We the freshest, I put that on everything
Get the message, it's already evident
Like moon crescent with the star and the seven in it
From planet rock with bambaataa as president
We the heaven sent
So you better get some better shit to try penetrate niggas intelligence
Pure heroin
So shut the fuck up whenever grown folks is talkin like your parents kid

[Hook]
