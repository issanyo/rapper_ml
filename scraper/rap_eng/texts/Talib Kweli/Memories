[Intro: Sunspot Jonz, (Talib Kweli)]
Yo we don't stop, who's in the spot right now
(Ayo it's Talib Kweli rocking with Sunspot Jonz man)
(Lobster Ramen nigga, yeah)

[Hook 1: Talib Kweli]
Let's take it back to the old school
Let's take it to Union Square
Let's take it back to the old school
Wave your hands like you just don't care
Yeah

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
I was raised in crack era Brooklyn
I can recognize the smell of crack when It's cookin'
Man, I used to play hooky and dancing was jukin'
Back when ratchet was a gun and a knife was for the juxxin'
A severe lack of funds got 'em masking up like the villain
I was in cyphers killing
Trust them niggas couldn't touch me but they had to feel it
Not yet a butterfly, I was still a caterpillar ready to fly
Got beautiful memories of mobbing like Genevieve
Critical how the leave in this lyrical den of thieves, please
Took a Greyhound to California
Hit the good life Cafe, where the legends was styling on 'em Nonstop rhyming since Top Ramen, so start climbing now 'Cause the future is not promised
So fond of these beautiful memories, unusual energies
A Stand up dude, ain't never bending my knees

[Hook 2: Sunspot Jonz]
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Let's take this way back to Oakland
Let's take this to Durant square
Sunspot and Talib Kweli
Put your hands in the fucking air
Yeah

[Verse 2: Sunspot Jonz]
These memories they just sent me on way back
Raised up in Oakland, the dope and the Cadillacs
Raised by a hustler, hustling, bring it back
Customers to a substance deep up in the track, yeah
Losing homies to violence all over bitches
Just another day, oh the jealousy how it gets us
I ain't collared with the drama, dishonor, it's only love
Hit the barbershop, foothill, grazed at Golden Cuts
At the Eastmont Mall, TWauz, I loved it all
Took the stream around the world, no radio play at all
Just believing in this hunger, Boy wonder would never crawl
Made the underground scene from nothing, nothing at all Black Panther soul with flow, this is the O
Mystik Journeymen, the Legends you already know
Years ago met Talib when he crashed at my crib
After that Greyhound ride showed him Telegraph rich Underground life yeah we did it
Independent, just like I love my women
We collecting these chips
Classics shoulda had Mos Def and Luck on this
This that Blackstar, Legend, underground shit

[Outro: Sunspot Jonz]
And we was doing this at broke as SummerJam live and it was just hype still at maritime
Damn that would be a great memory
(Make the best memories ever, underground, underground)

[Hook 3: Sunspot Jonz]
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
(Make the best memories ever, underground, underground, underground)
