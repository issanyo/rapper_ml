[Intro]
{laughs} We keep it dark around here
Oh, it's about to get dark around here
Yeah! Let's go

[Verse 1]
Let's go
Lean with it, rock with it, haters, put a sock in it
Sock puppets not stopping nothing so they mocking it
Hating what they can't understand, they illiterate
The truth is my proof, I ain't gotta be considerate
Nah, feelings ain't really my concern, want to slow burn
Press your luck, try pulling up, it'll be your turn
No sir, you were never any competition
Go first, try to test us or just stop bitching

[Break]
Let's go

[Verse 2]
Feel the beat, sent to me, courtesy of Will Magid
Killing all these fucking philistines that kill my feed
Still a king, chopping off their head like a guillotine
Still a queen, now she not your lover like Billie Jean
So impressive when delivering my message
I don't need your respect, I don't beg for acceptance
'Cause I take what I need, I never ask for permission
Making classic records, nigga class in session

[Break]
Let's go

[Bridge]
{laughs} Yeah
Yeah
We keep it dark around here
Oh, it's about to get dark around here

[Break]
Let's go

[Outro]
Still a king
Yeah, let's go
Classic
Class in session
