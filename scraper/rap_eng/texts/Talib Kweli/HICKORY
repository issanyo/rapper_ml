[Hook]
Oh my god what the fuck oh my god it's all love
Sometimes we do it for the kids other times we gotta do it for us
Somebody always wanna tell you you ain't doing enough
But if you listen to everybody you'll be looking all crazy and fucked up

[Verse 1: KOOL A.D.]
Every one is stupid, every one is dumb
Shout out to the moon, shout out to the sun
Peace to the ocean and shit. Pacific, specifically
But it's all the same ocean literally
Dog I'm greased up haters can't stick to me
Rollin' even if you can't picture me
Sticky green leaves, pussy smell victory
See me sittin' on the dock—hickory
Never really fuck with fuckery or dickery
Shout to Amaze 88
My grace slicker than Jefferson's Airplane, Starship, whatever mane
Stick with what's in front of me until I see a better plan
See me on Conan, next time Letterman
If not like I said "whatever man"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Hickory dickory dock
These haters want my victory stopped
Wish you would flock
These hits they consider me pop
My rapport with the fans more complicated than a mystery plot
My future brighter than your sisters reebok's
From uptown make you duck down like KRS used to
Fuck it duck down like Dru-Ha
Crush wild cuz you softer than a loofa
Black plus a watch still a rock thats a trutha
Reconzie the real homie you don't look too familiar
My familia we be hanging like mothafuckin Mr.Cooper
Never the ku klux
Niggas is important like a black man with a new tux
Cuz they sellin out for a few bux
Got this shit backwards like one girl two cups
When it comes to these rhymes who do you trust?
Im here forever fuck a buzzer, I ain't a crew cut

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Boots Riley]
Full cup pasificts, drank tenacity
Hustle till the sundance not Butch Cassidy
I am a revolver semi-automactically
Yelling "fuck the police" quiet emphatically
Light the flames of the gasoline dreams
In flicker of the fire is power never seen
There's a hope for better dreams
Selling coke from Medellín
Tagging names on the wall and I hope each letter sings
I write with lead pipes and hammers
Words are my weapons and I better not stammer
Proving this is science and action is better
Shut down the city you can beat it like a banner
Campaigns reversed by champagne and cursive
Got pain in our purses, bartenders and nurses
You motherfuckers nervous when we put them out of service
Call security with curses cuz we taking what our worth is

[Hook]
