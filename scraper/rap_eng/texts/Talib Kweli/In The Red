Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Here we go, are you recording?
Aiyyo Tone, is it ah, ah on?
Let it bump, they love it in the red
Reflection Eternal, that other shit is dead
Yes, let me know if you alive
Put your hands in the air, let me know if bring it live
Hey, come on, hey, I love music
Music is the river, we floating, we get to live it
Like the souls of those swept away crossing the Mississippi
Honorary spokesman, my focus is so scary
Vocalist for the hopeless, I'm championing my city
Cracks in the levy, we catching the last ferry
Apply this application that's crashing your Blackberry
Rock Steady like Aretha, it's got heavy
What's that about cat and mouse, Tom and Jerry?
Commissary get commissioned, the prison no sanctuary
For the locked up, every relationship adversary
Ain't no replacement, so make a statement before you buried
With very legendary already, no need to worry
Pay attention to the music, led your hazard to bury
Mixed for transistor radio speakers, Marvin married
His daughter in sort of a quest for a father figure
The little Stevie Wonder was killing 'em at the shows
Best songwriter since Smokey and Quincy Jones
Gill Scott and Last Poets turned they poems into song
Everybody know that my favorite Nina Simone
Rest in peace Michael Jackson, I think I need a shamone
Paid attention to his lyrics, he wished we leave him alone
(Leave me alone)
Huh, leave him alone
Huh, leave him alone
James Brown and Michael Jackson was working until they gone
On tour just so they could make payments on they homes
Everybody cried when Usher sang him a song
Joe Jackson was promoting his label, he know he wrong
Shame how our heroes are broke, we call 'em stars
That's because when they falling to earth, they falling hard
Everybody balling hard but they sound wack
If you in the resistance then this your soundtrack
Let it bump, they love it in the red
Reflection Eternal, that other shit is dead
Yes, let me know if you alive
Put your hands in the air, let me know if you alive
