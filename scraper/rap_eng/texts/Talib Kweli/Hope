[Verse 1: Pete]
Sometimes my hope slips away, I go through the day
Without a way to surpass the decay
To say a better day is coming got me running my mind
Wondering if i'm cunning enough to find
A new pattern of thought, design
So I can deal with this land of concrete
Cause them, facts is ill yo, we facing defeat
From the trees to the seas, to the seeds of the ghetto
The fleas on the dog's back have already settled, in
On a lot I don't meddle in cause they shoot (shoot, shoot)
Do anything for the loot (loot, loot)
We got politicians making wicked decisions
Straight lying to the public so
They can make begin another mission of war
And my eyes are sore, shits hardcore
We can all make a change, what we waiting for
There's a million other people who feel like I feel
Too many cats is ending up with a raw deal, for real
But, I read a book, take a look
Put it all in perspective, ignore the crooks
We be rocking they politricks, while running for president
If we want their asses kicked, then let's set a precedent
Cause it's not you versus me
But it's you and me versus the war industry
If you asking of me
What it is we can do against idiots like G.W
It's follow through

[Chorus]
It's what makes you cope
It's what makes you grow
It's what makes you go
Against the grain
When they tell you no, but you got to show
Your friends and foes it's time for change

It's what makes you cope
It's what makes you grow
It's what makes you go
Against the grain
But they can't tell you no, because now you know
The healing when you get hope


[Verse 2: Talib]
Yeah, I'm holding on like someone pushed me over the edge
So sometimes when I rhyme, it just go over ya head
I try to bring it down to earth without sounding berserk
It's for the people high and mighty and them down in the dirt
Put in work like a nickle or diamond
Standing on the corner religious like a shaman
I ain't fickle with rhymin'
The punchlines why they tickle your spine and picking the line
And I'm never fuck with you
You can't get a consignment
People hope to get signed, but today's a surprise
The industry falling down right in front of their eye
On my block brothers don't live, brother survive
Mothers pray through the night and hope they son is alive
Check the stoop then the corner then the hospital
Our city mourn, matter a fact shit I got to go
To my son's school, where they call me brother Kweli
No time for crime, waiting and hoping like Buddy Holly

[Chorus]
It's what makes you cope
It's what makes you grow
It's what makes you go
Against the grain
When they tell you no, but you got to show
Your friends and foes it's time for change

It's what makes you cope
It's what makes you grow
It's what makes you go
Against the grain
But they can't tell you no, because now you know
The healing when you get hope

[Verse 3:Pete]
I'm hoping for better days and better ways to express
I'm hoping for spiritual growth as a mental progress
Hoping I won't be choking, when it's time to take the test
Tough time as i'm standing in the limelight and rhyme
Will I shine will I be remembered as a person who took the time
And opportunity to find the goodness of his own kind
The kindness of the mankind
The kind that mixes in the images, relax and rewind
Yo it's a state of mind you can find me in
When i'm kicking back and i'm chilling
Looking now playing children impressive buildings
And i'm feeling that we more than the money hungry idiots
As marketing cats claim we be, man they can't get with us
It's the fuss of living
Looking for a balance between taking and giving and making a living
Without, making a preemptive killing, This shit is got to stop
I hope we find a revolution back in Hip Hop (back in Hip Hop)

[Chorus](2x)
It's what makes you cope
It's what makes you grow
It's what makes you go
Against the grain
When they tell you no, but you got to show
Your friends and foes it's time for change

It's what makes you cope
It's what makes you grow
It's what makes you go
Against the grain
But they can't tell you no, because now you know
The healing when you get hope
