[Verse 1]
Fuck y'all motherfuckas, fuck yo fame
Fuck yo team of niggas, fuck yo name
I could crush y'all cold, ice, diamonds. profane prolific
I'm Cobain but living
I'm "Don't Explain" Billie Holiday's spirit, you feel it
In your veins, heroin addict conceal it like the pain I revisit
Every time I do a line, more rhymes for nothing
So what's my time for? Writing off?
I endorse nothing, but me, shit
No product but free speech, prophetical Sleestak, nobody can reach me, go tweet THAT, Greasy
I'm the preacher of freedom rap, just freedom from being wack, no Perry, Madea crap, go head if you feeling that
I know, you'll gon' give me flack for it, "She's wack, we black, we as a people should stand for it"
Surprise nigga
Go open your eyes bigger, no not for them thighs, I uh, I'm destined to rise higher
We all is

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
We came too far to give up
So now we just got to live up

[Jean Grae]
I live high
Forget lows
And I fly
And I grow

[Talib Kweli]
See we so high when we get down
And once you fly can't forget how

[Jean Grae]
I live high
Forget lows
And I fly
And I grow
Keep it moving man

[Verse 2]
Outcast, misfit, the chick don't fit
Outlast your quick shit, cliques, hits
Boasts, beefs, wrists, fros, the gold teeth
Trend brought back, the shitloads, of switched dress codes
Damn jeans
"Damn Jean, you still rap? You still a fucking thorn?
Sticking yourself into more, war? For what?"
Well aww
I'm so happy that you asked! Applause:
To crack jaws
To black eyes
To change minds
To crack jokes
To chastise
To toast drinks
To expose
To promote THINK
To post links
To face foes
To erase foes
To face those who ain't know
To chase free caseloads with other free caseloads
But never to catch a case though, old skool, queso
Not to get poked on Facebook or fame, no
Just kidding
This is fo the same dough
Same lane playing, same ball, same park, same glow

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
We came too far to give up
So now we just got to live up

[Jean Grae]
I live high
Forget lows
And I fly
And I grow

[Talib Kweli]
See we so high when we get down
And once you fly can't forget how

[Jean Grae]
I live high
Forget lows
And I fly
And I grow
Keep it moving man

[Verse 3]
You gon' have to let me in at some point
Eh, you probably don't
'Cept at gunpoint
And if I said I had a gun it'd be a clich√©
Plus, it'd be a gun
Plus, be in your face
Welcome to my purgatory
The urgent story in a perpetual state, ignoring
If you can imagine the things it burdens on me
You can just imagine the hurt I've learned ignoring
My person is the person in the verses' stories
Versus the person in the first person stories
Versus the person to disperse the stories
No diversity that's worth exploring, not commercially
Personal boredom can lead to shit that makes it worser for them
I welcome it cause hell's a flaming bitch, I'm working for him
It's queer, are you gonna shaft her pack her in the rafters this year?
Or tag her backpacker stack and slap her rear, whatever
I'm irrational, passionate, clear, living in a moment you never will come near

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
We came too far to give up
So now we just got to live up

[Jean Grae]
I live high
Forget lows
And I fly
And I grow

[Talib Kweli]
See we so high when we get down
And once you fly can't forget how

[Jean Grae]
I live high
Forget lows
And I fly
And I grow
Keep it moving man
