Oh!

[Verse 1: Res & (Talib)]
Black veils and pageant dreams (yeah)
Mirrors and TV screens (come on)
Your eyes are laser beams (yeah)
Your moves like a trampoline
And you don't know where you've disappeared

[Chorus: Res]
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead

Put your hands together, uh
Yeah

[Verse 2: Res & (Talib)]
Short-circuit enemies (come on)
To be or not to be
Believer in daydreams (uh ha)
Sweet smell of gasoline
We don't know where we've been
Aimlessly on the scene
Black girls in magazines
Are breaking out the scene (let's go!)
And you don't know where you disappeared (woo!)

[Chorus: Res]
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead

[Bridge: Talib]
Outer space, out her place
Why she coming out her face?
Lack of taste, lack of faith
I'm the one who cracked her safe
Treasure hunt, pleasure fun
She wear a collar like Reverend Run
I'll make her engine rev and hum
She better come, better come
When she get here I disappear
Right here, that's that stare
That cause disaster, laughter, fear
Tension in the atmosphere
Still I just can't look away
I'm booked to stay – I'm hooked, OK
She's staying in my Brooklyn place
I took the bait – she took the cake

[Chorus: Res]
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead
Whoa, watch out where your vacant stare will lead

[Outro: Res & (Talib)
What are you looking for?
(Keep looking, keep looking!)
What are you searching for?
(Keep looking, keep searching)
Through those laser beams, beams
Through those laser beams, oh oh-oh-oh
Through those laser beams
Oh, you're looking so mean
What are you waiting for, oh?
