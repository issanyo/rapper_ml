[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
When I come to your town who gonna clown?
Proof in the sound and the boots on the ground
You shootin’ for the moon, I’m bringin’ Jupiter down
You always blow smoke like a hookah around
Slowpoke while runnin’ at a fast pace
That’s why you stayin’ in last place
I’m harder than a nipple when it lactate
You never reach third base
That’s why we always givin’ you the cash face
See I met your alter ego, African blood is in my DNA
These rappers actin’ like the lead in a play
Never know who they gonna be today
I pray to God, no not the paper
In my Chevrolet I’m bumpin’ Doc, Doc Shebeleza
Vacation in [Turkekegos?]
Stay sharp with the church in the plain clothes
Party rockin’ bought the whole damn party shop
Chop it like a body shop, better get made over
What up Durban? What up Cape Town? Man I love S.A. bro
Johannesburg holdin’ me down, Newtown, Pimville and Soweto
Stay faithful, live by the cove, I catch a face full of thirty seven O’s
All alone like a dog when he burying a bone
Cry to your mom, better hurry on home
Bitch nigga I do this
This music for the movement, helpin’ you to cut through the confusion
Cassper said hop on the remix, it’s nothin’, show me where the booth is

[Hook: Cassper Nyovest]
Shebeleza, Doc Doc Shebeleza
Shebeleza, Doc Doc Shebeleza
Shebeleza, Doc Doc Shebeleza
In my 325 like I'm Doc Doc Shebeleza

[Verse 2: Cassper Nyovest]
Now can you believe it, I dropped a track on some free shit
Now rappers turn parapalegic
Shoutout to [C-Sic?] I heard these haters is preachin’
Tell ‘em to suck on my penis
Should I repeat it? (Tell ‘em to suck on my penis)
I got a hit every season, I will remain undefeated
Shoutout to Tata Madiba, I'm outchea abusing the freedom
High as the ceiling, why should I mention the features
It’s already clear that I beat ‘em
Back to Refiloe they singin’ my songs in Zimbabwe
I’m rappin’ they nod in Mafikeng
Can’t keep it sealed, 200 k every weekend
I cannot explain the feelin’
Me and Talib on the remix, me and Talib on the remix
Man I got some demons, I am addicted to females
I fuck ‘em for no fuckin’ reason
I say it, now fuckin’ believe it
Berries, vanilla and peaches, berries, vanilla and peaches
Still tryna give Boitumelo a baby and no one can stop me
My album is bout to go gold, I heard you sold 200 copies
Maaaaan, this what they be hatin’ on
Mama Yvonne Chaka Chaka say this her favourite song
I'm doggin' everyday, Maar swak swak, Mabhebeza
I wake up every day feelin’ like Doc, Doc, Shebeleza

[Hook]
Shebeleza, Doc Doc Shebeleza
Shebeleza, Doc Doc Shebeleza
Shebeleza, Doc Doc Shebeleza
In my 325 like I'm Doc Doc Shebeleza

[Outro]
Still winnin’, still winnin’
