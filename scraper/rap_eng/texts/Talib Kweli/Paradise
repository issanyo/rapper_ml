[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
I’m the paradise architect, you be paralyzed off the rim
My heart dark as the blackest pimp, I’m the Cadillac with the tints
They try to squint just to see inside, what is it like to be alive
I killed the track just to see it die, where the CSI?
I don’t need the game, the game need me
Cause they got more defects than the KGB
When it’s proper for us to reflect you probably gonna deflect
The poverty that we see all America like a reject
I ain’t gotta leak it, you pay attention you peep it
You waited for some leader, the truth is never a secret
It’s gotta be online or a TV for you to see it
And even if you see it you never really believe it
You ain’t never gotta question, if I say it then I mean it
Rock the boat like Aaliyah, the flow is gettin’ you seasick
I die every night then I’m born again like a fetus
Get heavenly every week and hit paradise for the weekend

[Hook]
Every other city that we roam
And every day I'm here to grow old
What do I call this place I know?
Every day is like a country road
Everybody sees peace in droves
What do we call this place we know?

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I woke up early in the afternoon expecting life to be disaster soon
But sun kept me up way past the moon
Daily grind halted, scrambled eggs salted
My soul catapulted just to greet the high exalted
Who keeps my world spinnin’ through the glass ceiling?
Some say higher power but I truly have a feeling  it’s me
I keep my eyes locked on the sea
For knowing how far I’ll go if I just keep bein’ free
Where you been lately? I been halfway around the planet
Tryna learn the language of the lavish, god damnit
Risin’ with the tide to keep ‘em from going all manic
And holding down the fort for family if I so plan it
Paradise, gimme a signal from the satellites
To broadcast around the bend where it ain’t half as nice
Me and my people found Zion and packs of rice
Come join us for the last supper cause it happens twice

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Redman]
Now my paradise? Pounds of the best bud
Everything topless, Hefner
Cars, women, before Art Simmons
Red was diggin’ all in womens skins like Dexter
Yessir, I’m gettin’ better
Every paragraph is like the staff of team Mayweather
Hard work show you paradise
Or you can luck up and get a paradise from a pair of dice
Legalize it, lightin' the Isaac Hayes
Fuck chokin’ when you hit it girl, you need the Heimlich
Timeless lyrics for art, thou, I’m your highness
You can touch the sky by hearing these airliners
I’m a poster child for being so endowed
Women treat me like a court case, blow trial
Slam the hammer, I’ve been acquitted
Car sick, and I’ve been admitted
Redman and DJ EFN on your FM
The cheques in, then this another job for the X-Men
Create my paradise of life goals
Keep the hot nine on me like Ebro, nigga

[Hook]
