[Chorus: Shura]
There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I wanna do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind

[Verse 1: Shura]
I wanna touch you but I'm too late
I wanna touch you but there's history
I can't believe that it's been three years
Now when I see you, it's so bittersweet

[Chorus: Shura]
There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I wanna do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
I wonder, I wonder if I'd take you home
Would we create a poem
Or would you turn into Medusa 'til I'm made of stone?
I fell in love, I never played a role
I wanna shout it from the mountain into a megaphone
You take my breath with your touch like Darth Vader
I'm running down a dream like Tom Petty, I'm a heartbreaker
But then you changed up a relationship, I'm mostly bankrupt
There's a new kid on your block, I gotta hang tough

[Chorus: Shura]
There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I wanna do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind
There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I wanna do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Yeah, the effect of touch hands is like a miracle
How is it you're halfway across the world when I'm still feeling you?
Just a touch of my love, just a little bit
Ain't no love without trust, we gotta deal with this
We deal with touch on a physical plane
Like how your breath touched my ear everytime that you whisper my name
I'm strong out and you touched the blame
I need it, that's why solitary confinement is inhumane


[Chorus: Shura]
There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
(I've never felt so close, but now I know it's over)
And all I wanna do is go home with you
(Between us)
But I know I'm out of my mind
(Home with you, home with you)
There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
(I've never felt so close, but now I know it's over)
And all I wanna do is go home with you
(Between us)
But I know I'm out of my mind
(Never felt, never felt, never felt)
