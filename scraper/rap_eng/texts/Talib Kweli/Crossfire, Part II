[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Walk by her in the path of righteousness
I walk higher, toss liars
In the pit of hell, caught in the crossfire
Caught fire, from the big guns, these is not revolvers
Violence only creates confusion, it ain't a problem solver
Let's go, my skin is my dress code
Just know, I need a personal Jesus
I'm in Depeche Mode
My best show is when the bullets hit the flesh slow
This ain't a movie, dog, you know it when your chest explodes

[Chorus: Stephen]
I'd trade my luck to know
Why he's caught in the crossfire
And I'm here waking up
To the sun and the sound of birds
Society's anxiety
Deprived of all that we're blessed with
We just can't get enough, no

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
99 Problems, Sean Michael Carter
Can find ayala trying to fix my life like Evelyn Lazana
Midnight marauders, 12 hour cigars like godfathers
Starving artist trying to get some cut like the hardest barbers
It's gun culture, what I talk is dead coming from vultures
I promise I didn't choose to be a martyr, my enemies' focus
My heart seems to be the target if you ain't notice
These guns are still our youth, it's stolen moments

[Chorus: Stephen]
I'd trade my luck to know
Why he's caught in the crossfire
And I'm here waking up
To the sun and the sound of birds
Society's anxiety
Deprived of all that we're blessed with
We just can't get enough, no
