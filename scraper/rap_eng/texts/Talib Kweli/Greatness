[Hook: Talib Kweli]
Everywhere I go I get a standing ovation
Speaking in code, my game got no imitation
It's an innovation, we taking off like we in a space ship
You are now experiencing greatness
You are now experiencing greatness
You are now experiencing greatness
You are now experiencing greatness
You are now experiencing

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
One-two, this the sure shot
So high, I keep it cracking like it's the dope spot
Fuck the evil corporation, this Mr. Robot type
Music gotta move it, now this is your shot
To lose your constitution, get loose as a wet noodle
Got 'em dancing on Delancy, he as fancy as pet poodles
Got 'em downtown swinging like Danze and Lil' Fame
Send my enemies back to the essence from which you came
What inspire you? What is it you trynna do?
Somebody told you, "You should probably give it up," they lied to you
Never aspire to the average or the mediocre
Let the greatness inside of you take over
Stock broker or an activist, a soldier or a pacifist
Life a chain reaction, you are link or you are catalyst
Walking in house of god, your house of cards starts collapsing
Fashion killa higher than Philips and Nash
Fuck titles, you provoking a reaction
Are you slow or are you fast, man, are you smoking, are you passing?
Are you wishing, are you hoping, are you open for some action?
As serious as heart attacks, man, am I joking, am I laughing?
If you see me crack a smile, than I got paid tonight
I'm with my A-alikes or mama made a plate of rice
You say, "You need to dumb it down," like that's some great advice
Nah, I'm way too busy showing them what greatness like

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
Everywhere I go I get a standing ovation
Speaking in code, my game got no imitation
It's an innovation, you are now experiencing greatness
You are now experiencing greatness
You are now experiencing greatness
You are now experiencing greatness
You are now experiencing

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
I'm prepared for the greatness, spit a flow that'll strip your soul
Bare and naked, I ain't scared to say shit (yeah)
God is the greatest, no joke
I have my foes going through spiritual anguish, cause I'm clearly his favorite
Never here for the fake shit, staring at the so-called gangsters
We OGs nothing to play with
This is much more than entertainment
Still get on my Marlo, walk through the hood on some my name is my name shit
