[Verse One] [Naledge]:
Martin said he had a Dream, Malcolm said, "By any means"
40 years later, now I'm sorta seein' what he mean
Meaning that the American Dream is really just a fallacy
If we don't take interest in our American reality
And the reality is we need a new plan
Critics say we can't but Barack say we can
Can have better schools, health care for the youth
Take our neck out the noose go and bring back the troops
Give our nation a boost
We don't need another Clinton in office and I'm sayin' ain't that the truth?
A picture's worth a thousand words, ain't enough to say in this verse
To tell your people our here that we got work

[Chorus]:
I, I got work to do
I've got work baby (I got work baby)
I've been hustlin' baby (I got work)
Whoa
I, I got work to do
I've got work baby
[Naledge]:
To my hustlers out there grindin'
For that street money on the clock 9 to 5in'
Rock a suit and tie ? fly
We gotta work hard if we tryin' to get by

[Verse Two] [Talib Kweli]:
The workin' hands of the workin' man
Is fill with callouses
The tenements right across the street from where the palace is
The city in paralysis
The healthcare, the welfare
A farmer loses his farm in the country affects us all here
Hard work and dedication
God works His ways it's amazin', my words touch the heart of a nation
Like Barack when he pop off his topics of conversation
Rockets in my jeans, I got pockets of innovation
A lot of my inspiration comes from family
Still yo, ain't nobody handin' me nothin' that's just a fantasy
Doin' the same thing over and over again expectin' different results
Well, that's the definition of insanity
I don't usually vote, matter of fact the folks who don't usually vote
They usually quote me as a source of information
But in my lifetime I never seen Dr. King's dream
Fully realized in the flesh across the nation
Let's go

[Chorus]:
I, I got work to do
I've got work baby (I got work baby)
I've been hustlin' baby (I got work)
Whoa
I, I got work to do
I've got work baby
[Naledge]:
To my hustlers out there grindin'
For that street money on the clock 9 to 5in'
Rock a suit and tie ? fly
We gotta work hard if we tryin' to get by

[Verse Three] [Bun B]:
Ayo, they say the time is now and the place is here
C'mon America, face your fear
We're so close that I can smell it in the air
I can feel a change comin' and I can see clear
(I gotta make it babe)
We gotta show these people what to do
The youth, they wanna stand up but stand up for who?
Who's gonna help 'em with education?
Jobs?
Health?
The economy and fairer distribution of wealth?
They say no taxation without representation
We've been gettin' taxed ever since America became a nation
But lookin' in the face of the current administration
It's not reflectin' me and I'm startin' to lose my patience
Look here people I don't wanna sound preachy
But the current state of affairs in this country ain't peachy
It's not kosher and it's not real
It's time for a change, so let's keep it trill
We got work to do
