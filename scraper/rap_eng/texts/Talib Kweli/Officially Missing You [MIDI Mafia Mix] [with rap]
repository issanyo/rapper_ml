[Talib Kweli]
Everytime I walk up in the spot the corks pop
Got the floor hot, we goin' to rock until 4 o' clock
We used to keep a trick up my sleeve to get a chick to leave
Now we've got another one of them calling me
All eyes on you when you walk by
Your guy is doing stunts like the four guys
I know you make me feel like a six million dollar star tonight
The type to make every nigga holla

[Tamia]
All I hear is raindrops
Falling on the rooftop
Ooh baby tell me why'd you have to go
Cause this pain I feel
It won't go away
And today I'm officially missing you
I thought that from this heartache
I could escape
But I fronted long enough to know
There ain't no way
And today
I'm officially missing you

[Hook]
Ooh can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do
Hey baby say it stays on my mind
And I, I'm officially

[Tamia]
All I do is lay around
Two ears full tears
From looking at your face on the wall
Just a week ago you were my baby
Now I don't even know you at all
I don't know you at all
Well I wish that you would call me right now
So that I could get through to you somehow
But I guess it's safe to say baby safe to say
That I'm officially missing you

[Talib Kweli]
My baby is giving me the proper dance
Cause you know I'm the man
And these type of cats play the game of chance
Come close enough to show you how we 'suppose to love
You know they say we can't smoke in the club
But I'm cool cause your love is like a potion, a drug
These emotions got me open like buds
Roast, club boasts and I'm headed home with you
You know when you're going, I'm going to miss you
It's so official

[Tamia]
Well I thought I could just get over you baby
But I see that's something I just can't do
From the way you would hold me
To the sweet things you told me
I just can't find a way
To let go of you

[Hook]

[Tamia]
It official
You know that I'm missing you
Yeah yes
All I hear is raindrops
And I'm officially missing you
