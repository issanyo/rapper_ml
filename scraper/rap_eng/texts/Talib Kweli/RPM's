In order to understand today's modern phonograph record
We must understand the concept of revolutions per minute
Revolutions per minute refers to the unity of frequency of rotations
The number of full revolutions completed in one minute
Around a fixed axis. It is used as a measure
Of rotational speed of a mechanical component, such as a record player
Unfortunately that doesn't even exist any more
Talib Kweli + Hi-Tek on this particular record you're about to here
Take revolutions per minute to a new dimension
A shift in the paradigm of hip-hop
Please be sure to download this recording
From your nearest internet provider
Which is in itself, a shift in the paradigm of music
May all of your dreams come true, tonight
And tomorrow as well
And on into the future... {*echoes*}
