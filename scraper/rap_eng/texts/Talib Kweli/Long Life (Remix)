[Intro]
Yah Blacksmith, thats the movement that we moving with
Ay yo, I got a new name for these niggas this year
New name
Yah, I call them lullaby ass rappers
Cause they rock you to sleep
Thats what they trying to do
Trying to rock you to sleep
They set you up for the fall
And then they go in for the kill
But you're not rocking me to sleep
Who you?

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
You ain't ready for war, you got the wrong weapon
Looking for beef, you in the wrong section
Disrespect me to my face, you wilin'
That's a problem that could escalate to straight violence
'Til we can't wait to get the bangers, but it's never that deep
Learn to express your anger, man it's never that deep
Whatever, peace, man them carnivores got sharp teeth
Police stalk our streets
Like animals, that's why we call cops beasts
And they stay hungry for dark meat
So if your talking 'bout somebody over beats
Well then that's just not beef
Whats beef?
Beef is when your kids hungry as they go to sleep
Beef is when tanks is rolling down your street
Don't you hate when a nigga got some intellect
But say some dumb shit on the internet
Do I forgive him, yes
I would never stop and checks you out to get
Just because a nigga go to jail don't mean he Malcolm X

[Hook (x2): Talib Kweli]
I pray you live a long life
So when I see you, then I'll show you love on sight
Don't get it wrong though, I don't know if they told you
Front on me if you want, I will expose you
Do what you're told to

[Verse 2]
Talking, love languages
From ghetto corners where love languishes
People always asking what your angle is
The hustle in my bones caused trouble in the home
I document the struggle in the songs
Since the cord was
Cut from the navel
I been able to cut through the fables
And the labels, making deals up under the table
Leaving careers disabled
I turn the tables and resurrect the faithful like baby Jesus
It was cut from the stable
Watch me rise from the ashes
Like the flight of the phoenix
Like night for a genius
I wish you all could see this
Spit it like a young black leader
Taxi cab confessions man, run that meter
My peoples ain't the only ones either
Mexicans, they call'em beaners like the Mind of Mencia
Indians, they stole they land and try to ban their casinos
Man they don't want us around, but really know that they need us

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 3]
I'm old school, show respect that I'm supposed to
These fake rappers show you love when they approach you
They get around they little friends and try to roast you
Why they so bitter, hostile, antisocial
Proof that Hennessey don't go with Protools
Truth, I'm on the fast track you making slow moves
I'm having fun with rhyming
You stuck with guns and diamonds
With empty boats, no one is buying

[Hook (x2)]
