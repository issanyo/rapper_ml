[Kweli]
You wanna battle, I don't think so
Cincinnati are you ready for Kweli
It's wanna battle, rock with main flow
San Diego, come on
[Hip-hop worth dying for are you sure? X4]

Kweli, running through you town
Hunting you down
Fronting you down
This fucking clown
Try to come around for a pound
White boy with a backpack
Overheard talking about how Blackstar was whack
Hi-tek tracks was flat, try to give me some dap
Said I'm in his top five
Emcees he'd love to see perform live
He said, Krs was the best, Redman came second
He said he liked Super Nat but he don't like his records
The Roots was the best live as far as group
Mos Def's alright, but what's up with his leather suit
I see him on stage singing and doing rock covers
..Fucking Cocksucker
First thing I said is get the fuck out my face
Asshole probably think it's got something to with race
My crew is game tight, spell the name right on the marquee
Fucking with us yo it ain't like nobody ? dealing with culture
Stealing the show from the big name rapper whose career is over
And year after year he appear, as long as the hits are there, right?
Record or not, I'm a still be here
In the range rov, with main flow
Bumping the same dro
Rain flows on these b-boy heads like Kangols
African, call and response
You're not a purist, your pure shit
You don't preserve the culture, you disturb it
Niggas try to rhyme but couldn't fuck with the eternalist
Too much into ?herb and shit? so you became a journalist
Murdered this bitch and then I dragged him back to Brooklyn
Main, I'm going out to the pub, good-lookin

You wanna battle, I don't think so
Cincinnati are you ready for Kweli
It's wanna battle, rock with main flow
Brooklyn, come on
[Hip-hop worth dying for are you sure? X4]

[Main Flow]
Yo, backpackin poppin
Wonder when the axe droppin
Stacks poppin, reason keep the tracks hoppin
To the whack rap cats that act scared tonight
Cats prepare to fight like Dr. Dre and Eric Wright
Trying to keep me dry later for ? sneaky guy
Niggas that keep me high, rest in peace to Freaky tye
Live in die for this hiphop, forget cops, tip-top
Pulling your cards like gift shops
Round robin, some niggas out trying to clown common
They even ask me why I didn't drop on soundbombing
Or the Blackstar Train of Thought lounge shit
You fake-ass cats know who I'm down with
Big like big as the sun, big like military guns
Like L and Big Pun
When I flex grands, moving all through the next fans
Peace to Trouble T sugar shot from X-clan
Mark it D, hip-hops a part of me
Dark as me, sit back and spark a tree
With Kwa siggy, flowing reason shits not jiggy
Who shot my niggy world wiggy like Pac and Biggy

You wanna battle, I don't think so
Cincinnati are you ready for Kweli
It's wanna battle, rock with Main Flow
[Hip-hop worth dying for are you sure? X4]
