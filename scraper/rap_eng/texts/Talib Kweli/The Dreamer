[Skit]
I enjoy some of the old and I enjoy the new
And if I can find a balance between it, that's where I find my satisfaction

[Intro: Timan Family Choir & (Anderson .Paak)]
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now (yeah), keep dreaming

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I'm on my fifth brew and my rent's due
Sixth and west roof, I can see it all
Hold on to my hand, that's my little dude
Look at Kenzo, swagging like his paw
One for the occasion and get ya good suit
Fuck your reservation, bitch, I brought 'em all
Look at where you came from, Californication
Since a little baby skating in boogie boards and raiding your
Cookie jar, my radio analog, I wanted them
Nikes, mama got me Lugz (and all)

[Chorus 1: Anderson .Paak & Timan Family Choir]
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns
And who cares your daddy couldn't be here?
Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
One for the occasion, fuck your reservation
Call up all the haters, it's official
Californication, ever since a baby
Radio and the cable, I got the dish, too

[Chorus 1: Anderson .Paak & Timan Family Choir]
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns
And who cares your daddy couldn't be here?
Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns

[Interlude: Timan Family Choir]
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming

[Chorus 2: Anderson .Paak & Timan Family Choir]
This one's for all the little dreamers
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
And who cares your daddy couldn't be here?
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch

[Bridge: Talib Kweli]
This is the music that you gotta feel
Gave you the truth before I got a deal
No rabbit in a hat. It ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield
More like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale
Word to the free lunch. Who knew what we would become?
Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?
Yeah, this is the music that you gotta feel
Yeah, gave you the truth before I got a deal
No rabbit in a hat. It ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield
More like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale
Word to the free lunch. Who knew what we would become?
Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Used to be scared of all my fears
Till I woke up from this nightmare
Now what become of a dream deferred, now until we leave this earth
The music make your speakers burst, I always put my people first
It's deep how when I speak they say I'm preaching like I lead a church
No proper opposition, competition gonna need a nurse
My job as an artist is making miracles
To show you how to struggle poetic and make it lyrical
Crystallize the thought to make it clear to you
And make the revolution irresistable

[Chorus 1: Anderson .Paak]
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns
And who cares your daddy couldn't be here?
Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns

[Interlude: Timan Family Choir]
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming

[Outro]
Oh my gosh guys calm down
Stop it

[Skit]
Now evolution: Where it all going? Is it coming to an end or it it just beginning
There was one fellow who know'd Malibu quite well at a certain time in history
And I doubt if very few people are able to find these types of conditions again
Due to crowds and controls and much bureaucracy
But there are other areas which are magnificent, treasures of this world
And for somebody with adventure and excitement in their lives, and they have a lot of excitement and adventure
They can find this way of living
