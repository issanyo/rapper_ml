[Debarge]
I've been thinkin' 'Bout you for quite a while
You're on my mind everyday and every night
My every thought is you, the things you do
Seems so satisfying to me, I must confess it, girl
Ooh...and I like it
You send chills up my spine every time I take one look at you
Ooh...and I like it

[Talib Kewli]
We stop fuckin' around
Uh, yeah, and you say New York City
And you, and you say New York CIty

[Verse 1: Kool A.D]
Oh no, look at who they let in the back door
[?]
What the fuck we gon' do? You do know, you don't know
Shout to Michael Jackson, I got a million dollars
If you feel me, Holler!
Catch me playin' Frogger
On the internet, on a emulator
Ya'll emulators, I'll read the menu later
Right now I'm drinking water, thinking harder
1 in 6 people on Earth lack drinking water
Or was it 1 in 5? some say 1 in 9, Google that
Wait, how much water do you think that Google has?
I'm a stupid ass, in a coupe movin' stupid fast
I'm clownin', I'm gassed up
Look at all the cars that I've passed up
Should've thought twice before downin' that last cup
Yo I heard you speed law in Germany is like a hundred
Toured Europe like 3 or 4 times, hell yeah I'm stuntin'
Hell yeah I'm gunnin' for any fuckin' money I'm put in front of
Like you wouldn't, quit frontin'
Kool A.D the kid somthin'
I dunno wait, but nah, nothin'
Not for nothin'

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Uh, yeah, and you say New York City
And you, and you say New York CIty

Hey, don't be sacred and try to fight it
I know what you're hearin' kinda weird but I like it (like, like it, Like it)
That's all that really matter though
New York rap is back and it's so natural
What I gotta battle for
You already know that I'm foolish with the flow
Any community control
So I'm battle city hall
Till the city form a evil
Very small until they stroke it like the furry wall of pity ya'll
Sneak up on ya beats just like Normandy and attack base
Won't shoot till I see the whites of their eye of Das Racist
They're fearing' my black hat
You superstitious people stay clear of these black cats
Crossin' the path
Whether we're walking or takin' cabs
On the iron horse of god
Which ask you of todays man (man, man)
(what?) you must be kiddin' us like New York been lost
Ever since Bin Laden came through and crushed the buildings (fuck that son!)

And you say New York City x 4
And you and you say New York City x 4

[Verse 3: Heems]
Yo you like hip hop
5 bones for a CD
About the NYPD and days of the squeegee man
Before you came here fam
I'm the VIM in the MVP van
Towers came down, shift the burden on the brown
I'm murdering these clowns eatin' burgers in their towns
Murdering the sounds yeah I'm murdering the wacks
Coz they murdering the brown and they murdering the blacks
Resounding facts and astounding math
The evidence they laugh while they counting cash
The Counting Crows that's they music
They shooting
They stupid
Yo man these demons more clarity
Only project they care about is singularity
I'm like Dora The Explorer, I explore the diaspora
Shout out Frida Kahlo and all the women before her
I go [?] on a train. I get on a train and wack it
This a vintage colonial British jacket
I wear it and I paint my face white
And I go out and drink and dance all night (3x)
I wear it and I paint my face white and I go out and drink and dance all night
