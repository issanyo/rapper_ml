[Intro]
[Talib Kweli]
Brothaa...
In the jungle
Yea
Right there
Yo
Yo Hi-tek (whatchu wanna do)

[Verse 1]
What's next
These chicken neck mc's get me vexed
My rhymes be blowin up chatrooms all over the internet
Then cause their collisions on the highway of information
And then i head back to my prior engagement
In the nation of brooklyn
Land of trinis, haitians, jamacains and bejans
Its amazin how lickin shots is the proper representation
Soon they gonna need whack MC reservation
Cuz i endangered the mothafuckas, they needin preservation
Carry em home on top of a truck like a trophy
Niggas still sleepin like im jay-z in a video for hawaiian sophie
Its cool i stay low key, and keep a low pro
Come out crushin shit just for fun, co flow
(ay yo yo yo yo yo yo yo) here we go
Ridin on the sound wave out ya stereo
In the procession to ya burial
Callin hi-tek, little leon the professional
I got the special flow, listenin to estero
Puffin vegetables and now im red to go
The illest rhyme animal like chuck
Burn these niggas like salt when i lay in the cut
Think you about to blow when you continue to suck
The shit i been through make me run up in ya venue like what
I snatch the mic and ask the crowd 'what chyall waitin for'
The said 'nothin but that fat shit', 'i got you say no more'
I laid the law, and all the crab rappers played the floor
I called them out, a couple of them stepped up and i ate em raw
Some more whack niggas tried to spray the door, but had no aim
Later for them corn balls
On the way out smacked them in the face with a metaphor
For better or for worse, you better call the nurse
Before i send the cleaner and he get to your hospital room first

[Hook]
Yo
Whatchu wanna do I'm comin through ya front line
Ya whole plan is catchin tan in my sunshine
One time cuz it's some kinda wonderful
Dont just stand there lookin stupid whatchu wanna do?

Whatchu wanna do I'm comin through ya front line
Ya whole plan is catchin tan in my sunshine
One time cuz it's some kinda wonderful
Dont just stand there lookin stupid

[Verse 2]
I take your style and embarass it
Words beautifully written like arabic
Got niggas on the run cuz i bring the fire like chariot
Introduced pen skills to ill deliveries and married it
Put it in your face like big gats and carried it like Harriet
Various crews tried to bury us, but we shot em down like sagiterious
With that watch shit money, you can't be serious
You niggas is hilarious, actresses runnin around the club
Pissy like ghetto matresses
, thats why i smack these kids back to reality, and how it be in actuality, im ready to battle mc's and skip the fuckin formalities
We spark it, at any club or meat market sweet artists dont come on the block they become street targets
If you want it i got it, come and get it I'm wit it, your career will be shorter than a midget and the whole world will know who did it
I smack up these ho ass MC's like a gorilla pimp, you comin out the box like a gimp money you still a wimp
My shit blow out filaments in light fixtures, with the right mixture, words uses color the paint the right picture
Craft masterpieces, your whole shit is smashed to pieces make you look at your man who rhyme and be like 'you not nasty like he is'
Believe this when you see this, and dont fuck with me either, cuz youll be down where my feet is, curled up in a fetus
Cryin from the kicks, watch when i flip, people gonna be buyin my shit like fiends dyin for a hit, so

Whatchu wanna do I'm comin through ya front line
Ya whole plan is catchin tan in my sunshine
One time cuz it's some kinda wonderful
Dont just stand there lookin stupid whatchu wanna do?

Whatchu wanna do I'm comin through ya front line
Ya whole plan is catchin tan in my sunshine
One time cuz it's some kinda wonderful
Dont just stand there lookin stupid, stupid

(stupid, stupid)
