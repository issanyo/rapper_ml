Yes, original rhythm, the drum beater
Hi-Tek in the house, Kweli in the house, yo
No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner
Yeah, New York to California
The way we do it is fluid just like water
No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner
Life got a way of sneaking up on you
The way we do it is fluid just like water
Come on, beat on the drum like bang-bang
And tryna maintain the same frame of mind
While the game change
I know you sick of the same thing, we're different so
Stop sticking the needle up in the same vein
The definition of insane, my theory is Big Bang
We hunting for big game, the quick changeover
Got the rappers confused, Tek back on the board
Kweli is back in the booth, let's go
No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again, word
No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again
You can say that again
It's independent hustle, it got me on my grind
I flex my pen like a muscle and write a battle rhyme
I got to exercise, I got to get the ghosts out
I got to testify, the legend never die
I'm connected to the struggle, got a little light
And this little light of mine I'm 'bout to let it shine
I get better with time, so right when you about to say
Something real slick you like never mind
I stay grounded like airplanes that never fly
I still never come down, I'm forever high
My addiction is American as Devil's Pie
We stay where the snitches live and the rebels die
Men and women might try, numbers never lie
But I'm too fluid, there's no unit that I'm measured by
The nighttime when the ghetto come alive
And the artificial die like Yellow No. 5
No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again, word
No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again
Don't it sound African how the voice and the track just blend
The hands get to clapping and the feet get to tapping and
The power I'm tapping into, it never was accidental
In fact, what a rap ascension to what make hip hop so special
You check my Hip Hop credentials, I'm on like I'm rap's potential
It's what I've been sent to do, the task is monumental
These wack emcees make me laugh like Comedy Central
Rappers be acting gassed, it's really not a big issue
They'll lose their bodily tissue, cause something hot just hit you
Just for waving off the nigga tryna politic with you
He's like I gotta get him to try to politic with him
Man, he tried to front
That's what he want when these shots hit him
Bet you he change his mind
Better learn how to read the danger signs
Try to take my spot, get a number, wait in line
Try to skip, no, get to the back again
Yeah, we back again, you can like rap again, word
No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again, word
No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again
