Right now is the best moment you've ever known

Everything is perfect
Everything just fine
We keepin' everything moving while the
Sun is shinin'

Analog is in the house
Right now is the best moment you've ever known

Everything is perfect
Everything just fine
We keepin' everything moving while the
Sun is shinin'

My goddess, eh
The byproduct of New York City nights
When you criticizin' you caught up in all the pretty lights
Getting high in my city is like requirement, it's my environment
I wonâ€™t harp on it like a violin
Analog back in the house like a [?]
Posted up like a fan on the block
Hand to god, word is bond
Right now its the best moment you ever known
You gotta make it your own
Lets take her home
