[Intro]
Roll me up another one, let’s smoke one
I be gettin’ high

[Verse 1: Attitude]
Man I’m smokin’ everyday mainly just to calm my nerves
Stop to get a pack of squares and a Sprite to mix my serve
Riding in my foreign whip, almost ran up on the curb
Seen a little bitch that was oh so thick
So I pulled up on her like “what’s the word?”
Baby get in, let’s take a ride
Best decision you ever made if you get high
I might smoke an ounce cause it’s borin’ just to feel euphoric
I stay high like eagles and they’re head banging like [?]
A never ever O.G., I’mma tell you like momma told me
I’mma do me, drink my drank, smoke my weed like fuck police
Fuck papers be swishas sweets that loud pack got me leanin’ back
And there’s probly a cloud of smoke in a place that you see me at

[Hook]
Roll me up another one, let’s smoke one
I be gettin’ high, smokin’ til my eyes closed

[Bridge]
Roll up, roll up

[Verse 2: Cory Mo]
I got about a hundred bad bitches I could choose from
But I’d rather be ashin’ a blunt rollin’ a new one
Smokin’ on the loud pack, potna never mid-grade
Paper, swisha, pipe, bong, trippy stick, I hit it mayne
Been there and I did it man, hot in every city mayne
If the reefer not strong enough a nigga like me might not hit it man
Twenty five lighters on the dresser, ho
Yes, I’m a kinda bitch professional
So don’t ask no stupid ass question ho
Don’t wanna be around smoke, gotta let ya go
Slowly roll, take your time, put it in the grind and break it down
Twist it up put five to it, puff, puff, give, pass it round
No babysittin’, put it in rotation
Shit so potent get a standin’ ovation
OG kush and the girl scout cookie guide e’erybody blowed in the congregation
Fuck whatcha think, I’d rather blaze up, you can have the drank
I take that back, pour me up a shot
Ain’t no such thing as "no I can’t"
But it tastes much better with a cloud of smoke
And you’ll never see me here from all the loud I smoke
It tastes much better with a cloud of smoke
So just holla at a playa if you down to smoke

[Outro]
Roll me up another one let’s smoke one
I be gettin’ high, smokin’ til my eyes closed
Keep some loud on me, everywhere I go
And if we ever run out we gon’ go and get some more
And roll up
