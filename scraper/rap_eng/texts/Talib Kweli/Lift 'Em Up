[Verse One] [Derek 32zero]:
Here's to the world, thanks for all the motivation
See my rhymes come across like dodgin' immigration
We stay at a loss like the Oakland Raider nation
My people rise and die, complete opposite of inflation
We
We balance the equation
Heard lies within they lullabies of our emancipation
Fools try for gold, willin' to sell they souls
We killin' shows, keepin' it blacker than Ester Rowe
We
We crack with the elevation
Above C/sea level
A/aye, B/be honest with graduation
But still scrutinize like the Obama administration
A future of movin' me to the final destination
A violence in my eyelids but I'm a hybrid of
Of Dr. King and P-Town fiends
You see they move white to get green to see brown dirt
You see I moonlight to get dreams, puttin' in work

[Chorus]:
We lift 'em up
Way high in the sky
It's U.N.I. verse and not another man die
We lift 'em up
Way up in the air
Girl dance away your cares, fall in love with your hair
We lift 'em up
Where that same air is thin
Where all my people there fall in love with your skin
V.A. (V.A.)
N.Y. (N.Y.)
N.J. (N.J.)
P.A. (P.A.)

[Verse Two] [Derek 32zero]:
We
Are the heroes
Feels great to be me
We got a whole community that's dependin' on we
From Gutter Rainbows to flows
Ice cold as can be
It's Derek 3-2-0, Talib Kweli

[Talib Kweli]:
We lift 'em up like we orbitin'
Bare witness to the torturin'
The competition forfeitin'
Couldn't have even bought 'em when
Raps my religion, to be wack would be a mortal sin
Rappers think they deep as scuba divers when they snorkelin'
You're borderin' on soft ya life is all a bore
Sick 'em, never call 'em off
Ya posin' but my flows exposin' all ya flaws
Ya finishin' the bottle, throwin' cocktails and Molotov
To top it off I'm always the first to set it off or pop it off
We get it started right
To kill it is the party life
Scorsese, they on the floor crazy, I'm at the bar like
"Let me get a Jameson."
Meet somebody and shake firm like the gossip or the counsel in the Caymen
Keep the grown up man at peace
Willin' to grab his piece to protect a piece of your own
If you don't agree with me?
To each his own
You're always sleepin' on the one you're watchin'
Sun is hot, bring it back like we in Jamaica
Bumbaclot

[Chorus]:
We lift 'em up
Way high in the sky
It's U.N.I. verse and not another man die
We lift 'em up
Way up in the air
Girl dance away your cares, fall in love with your hair
We lift 'em up
Where that same air is thin
Where all my people there fall in love with your skin
D.C. (D.C.)
Miami (Miami)
A.T.L. (A.T.L.)
Chi-Town (Chi-Town)

[Verse Three]:
Now I don't care if it's popular
Feel it through your monitor
The revolution keep movin', sleep raisin' the shot of the
Never been a follower
Supplyin' for rockin' the bells
An outline like Malcolm Gladwell, they use gel like it's a
Rite of passage
For that they should get blasted
Or at least be the next contestants in the Gangstalicious pageant
This here is black magic
And for all who believe
We double shiftin', liftin' up our sleeve
True indeed

[Chorus]:
We lift 'em up
Way high in the sky
It's U.N.I. verse and not another man die
We lift 'em up
Way up in the air
Girl dance away your cares, fall in love with your hair
We lift 'em up
Where that same air is thin
Where all my people there fall in love with your skin
Minneapolis (Minneapolis)
Dallas (Dallas)
Seattle (Seattle)
L.A. (L.A.)
Okay

We are the ultimate
Super microphone shit
We lift 'em up
We lift 'em up
We lift 'em
We are the ultimate
Super microphone shit
We lift 'em up
We lift 'em up
We lift 'em
