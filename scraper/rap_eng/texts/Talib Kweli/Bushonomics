Revolutions require participation
But sometimes people be hesitating
The government must respect the will of the people
The government serve the people
The people don't serve the government

Voter registration with no scope of education
It's a waste of time with no hope
It's just frustration
It's not a choice when you're picking the voice of a nation
You're just contributing to the status quo's preservation
Plus we ain't got no universal health care
And who the hell care about crack mothers on welfare?
Listening to dead prez, hell yeah
But jay-z first
Thinking of how we was snatched
Like old ladies' purses
Dropped on american soil
For a greater purpose
Plus I know my people got layers
You gotta break the surface
The way I rap got the man nervous
Frodo failed bush
Got the ring snitching like he's got a sink (?)
Fixing elections like it's not a thing
Somebody
Please expose the fact
That it's going back
To one party
They called president bill clinton a whoremonger
Voted him out
Replaced with a warmonger

Hook
It's like a jungle sometimes
I'm at the front of the line
I ain't tripping
But I stumble sometimes
Then I get right back up
Then I get right back up
It's like a jungle sometimes
I'm at the front of the line
I ain't tripping
But I stumble sometimes
Then I get right back up
Then I get right back up

Liars and thieves
Best believe
That their record is ??
Weapons of mass destruction
The reason for catching saddam
Lack of concern for the environment affected the storm
We can predict the levees breaking
Like a zeppelin song
The president warned
But before the levees broke
The people was
They already owned the oil there
So there ain't nothing they need from us
Caught up in +the fog of war+
They let the big easy flood
You telling me that you would do what jesus does?
No, I don't believe you would
The master teacher's back here to speak with us
With the passion of a preacher
And raps that make the speakers bust
The way he tackles the topics
Will have an agnostic
Acknowledging the last prophet
Fulfilled the promise of frederick douglass
Acquainted with death
He step among us
On the blocks and corners
The people he taking steadily getting younger (?)
You ain't over or getting younger
I'm getting older, I ain't getting younger
I know there's strength in numbers
