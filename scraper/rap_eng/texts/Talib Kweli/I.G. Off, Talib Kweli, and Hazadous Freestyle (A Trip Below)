[Intro: I.G. Off]
Yo, what the dealie?  Big Supernat up in the house.  Reflection Eternal in the house.  I.G. Off and Hazadous up in the house.  What up?  What up, world?  Unsigned and hungry emcees.  What up, world?

[Verse 1: I.G. Off]
Yo, it’s me, the phonetician.  With my doctrine
I’ll outfox ‘em, outbox ‘em, outrock ‘em, I’ll top ‘em
Off the D-O-M-E, I’ll blow the S-P-O-T
I’ll make it H-O-T for any corny emcee
You cornballs all fall.  It’s freefall—who want to brawl?
Bring it all, bring it on.  I’m leaving corny emcees encumbered
One against a hundred and they’re still outnumbered
I’m the illest—you feel this.  When they rhyme, you don’t feel ya
When I flow, you reconsider.  I’m considered an enigma
You get froze and shivers in your timbers from what we deliver
I’ll hit you with fatal blow to your arteries
Break your fucking mass up just like a philly
Split your left leg up ‘til I get up to your knee
And then I’ll watch your face while your ass scream in agony
You don’t want no parts of me.  The name is I.G
Period.  When I deliver it, it’s strictly inconsiderate
And if you don’t like it, you could just take it that way
It’s the Bronx and the nigga from Far Rockaway
So, yo, Reflection Eternal, what you got to say?
Next up on the mic, let your vocal style spray

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli (of Reflection Eternal)]
I’ll let my shit spray like a mist
Doesn’t matter.  I’ll come through like you get a kiss
On the cheek.  Doesn’t matter.  Yo, I speak the shit
That make the other niggas’ shit seem obsolete.  These niggas
Is weak.  Yo, they’ll get beat over the head with my beeper
Yo, they get run like a sneaker by a nigga
Who got no cash.  It doesn’t matter.  I’m all up on that ass
Coming through, your ass get head quick, fast
Like you needed a break.  Doesn’t matter.  I’ll come through
Your ass get eaten like a steak.  How much more this
Can I take?  Yo, this beat is a winner.  Got DJ Spinna
Masta like a Jig.  You was all in
The mud like a pig, but I don’t fuck with swine
Coming through, my mind is my business
That’s why I rewind if I said, “Do this shit over”
Yo, come through.  I’m a commander like Cobra
Yo, doesn’t matter ‘cause I’m crazy like Eddie
Yo, but, keep that on the Down Low, forget it
Like it was spaghetti.  You was a fugazi
Doesn’t matter.  These niggas is "H.O.U.S.E."ing like Doug Lazy
Or they’re stomping like KYs.  These guys
Yo, come through, they get swatted like flies
Yo, when I need some strength, I drink a Sea Moss
Or a Peanut Punch.  Niggas, I get... yo, I eat ‘em for lunch
Yo, I had to take a break off my job
Working at Nkiru Books is kind of hard
But, yo, I’ll take an emcee and jab like a lighting rod
Strike you.  Doesn’t matter.  I never liked you
Anyway in the first place.  You was life from the worst race
And the worst place.  And, in the first place
I’d have to state again, “Yo, you was not my friend”
So while you try play light, my enemy, comprehend
What I’m about to do to you: run through you.  You
Need to transfer from the two to the three to get a five
Your style’s not alive—that’s why we call it dead
Yo, these rhymes is crazy off the top of the head
Or the dome.  You split it in half and do me
If I said your name in my rhyme, fuck it.  Sue me
I don’t really care and it doesn’t really matter
Come on, Hazadous.  Just make the track fatter

[Interlude 1: Hazadous]
One, two.  The H-A-Z in the place to be.  Nah’m saying?  Jigmasta thing, aight?  Big up Uptown.  All-the-way live.  Fortified (No doubt).  Uh.  Yo, check it out.  Cats be fronting a whole lot, so we’re gonna do it like this.  Yo

[Verse 3: Hazadous]
Fuck a gun.  I’ll load up my mind and blow crews out the frame
What’s your aim?  You like Pinky and I’m The Brain
I’m a man that knows a million different methods to bring emcees pain
Stepping to the high?  Now that sounds insane
The concrete jungle made me Tarzan, so I guess you Jane
My thoughts are long-range like the heat from the Sun
What I speak is heard worldwide and celebrated in every slum
East Coast to West Coast, it don’t matter where you from
We all the same—we love hip hop and we surrounded by cracks and guns
Travel a million miles but you still can’t run
I think it’s the city lights that make me so numb
Drop it on emcees and make ‘em hit the ground like they weigh a ton
Plus I got this on lock like I’m selling them long jumbs
And, on top of all of that, I’m tighter than Primo drums
Break you down like subtractions, split wigs to small fractions
‘Til the day I can grab clouds out the sky, I’ma keep stacking
When I can’t get hip hop, I’ll bug out like Fatal Attraction
Since we don’t film movies, you can stop all the acting
And we don’t need Puffy dancing in our videos to go platinum
Like that, son.  You understand?  We keep it clapping
Keep it coming.  Yo, um, black in brethren
A lot of...

[Outro: All]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Like that, y’all.  That’s that street.  That’s that street hip hop right there.  We’re just having fun.  Eddie Ill, D.L.  Shh...
