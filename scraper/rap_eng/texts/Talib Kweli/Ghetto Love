[Hook: Free]
I'm heading to the club and I'm looking for something
Ain't putting on this pink dress in here for nothing
I'm whispering in your ear, boy, I hope you're receiving
I'm 'bout to share all my secrets, tell you things I'll be needing
I'm a grown ass woman, boy
You gotta show me, let me know
Give me love, make me believe, I'm all that you need
Leave them hoes out in the street
I don't wanna have to bring the heat
If you ain't ready to roll, leave me alone
Cause all we really want is love
And all we really need is love
Ain't asking for too much
Just respect and love
All we really need is ghetto love

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Friends turn into lovers after drinks
You hit it in the crib, she left her eyelash on the sink
Your girl madder than the pink I splashed on her mink
Cause you gotta bad habit of acting before you think, wow
Soon as you see them out, you know what they be about
Looking for a nigga people read about
You lead 'em out the club, let 'em see the house
Lead 'em to the couch
Now he got 'em so open all he wanna do is eat 'em out
She's way hotter than 8 shots straight vodka
You play the proper spots then you may spot her
Wisk by the velvet rope
Legs longer than Mariah held a note
Got you seeing stars without a telescope
Do she sell it? Nope, on second thought maybe she do
Go to school and got a baby or two
Now she got you wondering if your relationship's through
Listening to Curtis Mayfield's "Make It To You"

[Verse 2: Free]
Listen boy if you wanna act up, then listen
We can both act up
I've been tryna be real with you
But you keep coming with the drama, I can't deal with you
It's the little shit, let me know you're late
Keep the D rock hard, make sure I'm straight
I don't ask for much, got a J-O-B, my own dreams
But things ain't always what they seem
I thought you had me baby
From the back to the front thought I was your baby
But once I gave in you started acting shady
Started acting crazy, don't wanna be your lady no more
Now all you got is memories of me on all-fours
The back of me heading out of your front door
You can't blame the seasons, I told you that's what I was needing
