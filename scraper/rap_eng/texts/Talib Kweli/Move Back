[Intro]
Ayy, you're too close

[Hook x4]
Motherfucker, move back!

Move back, move back, I'mma bitch slap the next one

That's what I'm talking about (x3)

[Verse]
Ay yo, I'm married to the shit, but that's an institution
As for the love, but the money make the shit confusing
I must be why the divorce rate is through the roof and
Bitches that's just in it for the dough and make it too abusing
Motherfucker move back, or just keep it moving
I'm a problem for these niggas cause I'm the solution
The music they're doing, they're doing cause they're disillusioned
Niggas got labels, now it's time for distribution
About to organize all the real niggas too
Not them Bill O'Reilly-faced smiley face, jigga boos
Niggas who snitch on you is scared to pull the trigger too
We get at you and run up on you like the Nile River do

[Bridge]
I know God don't like ugly
But I can take it there, trust me
I know my mama proud of me
So no, you ain't got to love me

[Hook + Scratch]

[Outro]
That's right, bitches!
