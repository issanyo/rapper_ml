[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Introducin' 80 Blocks

[Verse 1 — Geechi Suede]
Infinity interlude
I'm in the mood (uh)
I'm a royal the
The remy makin' her oohs
Slip off your shoes
Screen shootin' a cinema through the lens of the tombs

[Verse 2 — Sonny Cheeba]
Pull up in the rhythm machine and they fall in
Freakish love, pieces of a dream I'm recallin'
Kiss my double barrel because the VG Lean is clean
LTD is Cheeba, Unlimited Orchestra
She addicted to Barry White
Keep strawberry fields forever
Pull a Sister Sledge-hammer if I ask
BX Masked Crusaders and native Peter Parker
Meetin Layla in Washington underneath the moon

[Hook]
Ladies and gentlemen
We got every damn thing (yeah)
Hell, we got plenty to drink (that's right)
Hell, we got wine, beer, whiskey, gin

[Verse 3 — Geechi Suede]
Pullin' petals off of 'bezzles switchin' levels
Knockin'
I'mma tell 'em how I tell 'em
From the Vernon to the Pelham
We gonna spill it on 'em tonight

[Verse 4 — Sonny Cheeba]
A sole combination
Back by Apollo
A nation of millions
Into the Tiffany's feeling
A shine Sly Stone
Let's coast to the Kokomo

[Verse 5 — Talib Kweli]
Slow sippin' like whiskey inside of my cup
Admirin' the siren
Tryin' to get up inside
Violent
That's how you turn 'em off

Dancin' just to burn 'em off
Word is bond
See that cherry poppin' 'em like molly
Sorry, pardon my French, like Les Miserable
Marquis de Sade
Got cheddar on the brain
Climbin' out of the pigeonhole
