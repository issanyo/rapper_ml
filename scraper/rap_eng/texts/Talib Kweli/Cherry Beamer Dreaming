[Verse 1]
So full of myself, so full on these beats
Go from local to global my flow is loco, dodo
The lazy stoner is drinking Merlot we in risotto
Such a classy guy, iconic in every photo
The competition’s at a dead end
You too weak, like John and Yoko at the bed in
I hit the dodo when the sex ends
Then me and Jojo in that photo of our friend Tony Manolo
I’m like damn, homie
You cannot keep up with my brain homie
What the fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta; my ring is king like Coretta
Greatest never gets forgotten, bitch I’m livin’ forever

[Hook]
Said I’m living forever, I’m living forever
Man you say that you do this shit and you could do this better
But you can’t, naw you can’t
You can’t, naw you can’t

[Verse 2]
Cherry Beamer dreaming with my comrades
Happy trees calling acuvue catch a contact
I’m a poet that has gone mad
I’m always loaded with the potent and the strong that
Lucky lefty Rosenthal, country shit, I’m over y’all
Nope I’m never sober y’all, Dali paintings on the wall
Scratch you with that tiger claw, king shit, lion paw
All that shit that I embody take over like Viacom
Find a girl like Goldie Hawn, find a beat to O.D. on
I flow the force like Obi-wan, it’s Friday get your smokey on
Ain’t no love involved, really fuck ‘em all
So full of myself like Russian dolls, damn, homie
You cannot keep up with my bread homie
What the fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta, I’m in the spot like Cruella
Greatest never gets forgotten, bitch I’m livin’ forever

[Hook]
