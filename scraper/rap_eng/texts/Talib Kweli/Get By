[Sample]
My home, my home
Get stoned, get stoned, get stoned, get stoned

[Talib Kweli]
We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too, like Attack of the Clones
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you egos spread rumors
We're survivalists turned to consumers
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words melt in my mouth
They hot like the jail cell in the South
Before my nigga CORE bailed me out
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like Bed-Stuy
Through the red sky with the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some G. Rap shit, Living to Let Die
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Get fly -

"Looks like a good landing area"
"T-Time we get some answers. Settle down"
"Landing on the hilltop of the surface, they step out [?] the hostile unseen ruin"
"It looks as though we -"
"Yeah, I know, as though as we stepped back -"
"Then left around until you - now here comes the music"
