When I get home, unplug the phone
Turn out the lights, I serve this song
I'm gonna call my baby
Tell him that I'm coming
See, I been gone for way too long
He needs some lovin'
See last night on the phone
He told me that he missed me
And I listened to his song
It sounded kinda sexy
Check it out, I said, um, I said
My baby on the job, I know she's workin hard
She independent and I love that show, I swear to God
The way she get up, I know she ain't really got no fear
No, I don't make it rain, but still I'm the one that got her bed
I need her all at once, I been on tour for months
Her body like a stage, as soon as I hit, I tore it up
She love how I perform, come get a hype like her favorite song
We riders of the storm, touch me, baby, like the dawn
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the nighttime comes
And I see my baby
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the midnight hour
And I see my, I'll be home tonight, I'll be by his side
Listen, can't wait till the night begin, can't wait to let her in
Ready to handle this, the candle's lit, the light's is dim
So dark be inner vision and she might lose her and inhibitions
Hourglass figure make it last past ten
Four hours last long no intermission
I'll come every once in a while
Just to let her know her love in town
I'm here to stay so there ain't no way
I know she love the sound of that
I'll make her love come down to earth
That's worth another round
Can't take another clown, in love with the kid
'Cause he underground
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the nighttime comes
And I see my baby
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the midnight hour
And I see my, I'll be home tonight, I'll be by his side
Listen, somebody call my baby, say I'm on the way now
See, I been going crazy thinking 'bout you late nights
The way my heart reacts it lets me know I need him
See, I been getting flashbacks, I just got to see him
Hopped out the taxicab, she almost didn't pay
He let me get your bags, I got some things to say
I know you miss me, girl, you know I miss you too
We kissing taking turns, so let's go to the room
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the nighttime comes
And I see my baby
Ooh, said I just can't wait till the midnight hour
And I see my, I'll be home tonight, I'll be by his side
Listen uh, when I get home, unplug the phone
Turn out the lights, I serve this song
He said when you get home, unplug the phone
The lights is off, you know it's on, know it's on
Ooh, that I made it home, baby, lock that door
And be ready for me
Ooh, and it's been some months and we don't have long
But I'm here now
I made it home tonight
I'll be by your side
Don't worry 'bout the time
I made it home tonight, listen, uh
