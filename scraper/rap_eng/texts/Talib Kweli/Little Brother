'Now listen'
[Mos]
..doin this song for you
All my little brothers.. out in the street
Strugglin to survive.. keep your eyes on the prize, you know

[Kweli]
Yeah, the revolution will not be televised
Or broadcast live on the net
My man Mos said it's personal.. knamsayin?
It's gotta start from right up in here, you know

[Mos & Kweli]
You can't stop, you know [3x]
You can't stop when we rep

[Kweli]
We rep the ain't-gots
Ain't nobody can't start no party like us, we crush the faint hearts
From Hallsey to St. Mark's, walk in the main blocks
Painted with blood that's still hot, so deep it stain socks
The pain spark frustration, situations lead to hatin
Some deal with drug distribution, others walk the plantation
Some know the code a' the streets, some got a college education
Come down on the weekend, and peep the conversation

[Mos]
Yo
On the corner, units stormed out
Ghetto lookin bombed out
Police waited to roll, for those who walk the wrong route
Shorties goin all out, they got they swords drawn out
Ready to brawl out, gettin fought til they fall out
Black like Morehouse, 40 o'z is tossed out
For brothers that they mourn bout, get wrecked til it's dawn out
Whether they broke or flossed out, honeys pass they draws out
Lookin for a ticket out the poor-house
A jungle out here
Lions keep they claws out, fangs and jaws out
Weak just get forced out
Names is called out, ghetto-fame is sought out
You wanna be the man that they talk bout
I walked out
I had some things on my mind to sort out
I thought bout the wild circumstance we born out
Remember myself at your age, when I was just like you
If that was now, I don't know what I would do
My ears is closest to me
So what I say to you is goin for me
Son we both still growin indeed
But where you at, I was, and where you been, I left
Utilize my experience to guide your step
Some people get love but don't command respect
It's somethin that you can't ride with a check
Or a rolly or lex or icy links that hang from your neck
If it's real, who need to deal with the special effects?

[Kweli]
Come here, come here, yo
Lemme drop this on ya, look they gotchu cornered
The corner of the block is hot, I ain't got to warn ya
Cause I see you every day, trapped in every way
'Shit, I'm a thug, and that's all that I can say'
Who are you anyway?
Mary J.? I spend, many nights awake, watchin you while you sleep
Tryin to figure out how to be the example, cause talk is cheap
As you walk the streets, study cats on the real
In a convo, just make your point to relax and chill
[Niggas] wanna destroy each other in a cypher instead a' build
Be a- man of will, don't be- standin still
If you- don't plan ahead, then you- plan to fail
Dudes be in a daze when the ways reveal
Like they funny style but I'm not laughin
Serious [niggas] makin money while the police is passin
Can't wait for opportunity to knock, you gotta make it happen
It ain't about no spectacular ways a' rappin
Just immaculate ways a' action.. dig?

[Mos sings]
Little Brother
I know that times is hard
Keep your mind on god
Stay clear of danger and harm n'
You'll get along
I sing my song
For little brothers
Out there in the street
Strugglin to make ends meet
Gotta hold the heat
Strugglin so hard to compete
Stay clear of danger and harm
Do it for y'all
Try to stay strong
Keep movin on [6x]

[Shoutin out Little Brothers all over the area, simultaneous singing]
