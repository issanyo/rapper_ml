[Intro: Sample + Talib Kweli]
"She's got her ticket, I think she gonna use it
I think she goin' to fly away
No one should try and stop her, persuade her with their power
She says that her mind is made"
Hold up
Where you goin', girl?
Where you goin'?
Hold up
"She's got her ticket—"

[Chorus: Sample + Talib Kweli]
"She's got her ticket, I think she gonna use it
I think she goin' to fly away" (Where you goin'?)
"No one should try and stop her—" (Uh) "—persuade her with their power" (Yeah)
"She says that her mind is made"
(This a story we all familiar with)

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Yeah we all tryin to live worry free
Pretty young things affection is like currency
Talking bout a country girl living in a city though
Searching but she get her moral compass from these videos
Girl you'll be killing and searching your faith or new tears
Courage under fire especially after a few beers
Already broke the resolution for a new year
They blushin cause they sayin it's nothing inside a few years
Until I came across this dame I used to baby sit
At the club looking for this lame she had a baby with
Wait a minute you're only 17 and she said to me
My baby gave me strength to leave the city life ain't meant for me
Father can't be bothered, I'm here to make my peace
So offered her some money but she started quoting Jay to me
I'll do you one better, I slay these niggas faithfully
I don't need you to pay for me, I just need you to pray for me

[Chorus: Sample + Talib Kweli]
"She's got her ticket, I think she gonna use it" (Come on)
"I think she goin' to fly away
No one should try and stop her, persuade her with their power" (Yeah)
"She says that her mind is made"
(Girl—don't change your mind)

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
When you call up and captain say that ain't no hero
What you really bring to the table let's keep the real dough
No matter where you're going if you don't get your mind right
First choose between two evils like this is Twilight
She up in the kitchen tonight cooking the grams up..
Gotta take you to right the Peter Pan but
She gotta take it to..she got a grant..
She gotta take it to fly she had a lan and she try
She tryin to avoid the trap is like the cancer
The love of money run in her vein, now she a dancer
Now the blow go in her nose to keep her dancin'
The high is the only escape, she like a phantom
A ghost just a sell of herself packing them pasttense
Closer to selling herself, using her assets
Ain't nothing left to shake let's break it all down
Got it inside her veins, she takin' off now

[Chorus: Sample + Talib Kweli]
"She's got her ticket, I think she gonna use it" (Yeah)
"I think she goin' to fly away
No one should try and stop her, persuade her with their power" (Uh uh)
"She says that her mind is made"

[Bridge: Talib Kweli]
Fly high, fly, fly
Sky high, yeah
Hold up, where you're goin', girl?
Where you're goin'?
Hold up, where you're goin', girl?
Where you're goin'?
Hold up, where you're goin', girl?
Where you're goin'?
Hold up, where you goin'? Damn

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Damn, I'll found her later that she don't know who her father was
I’m like this crazy, a baby ain’t got no starter kit
She never met the real..foe they tried to steal her goodies
They breakin' into her candy store
We holdin' pistols and Willy Wonka for soldier sistas
'Cause when we're taking the gold and taking the coldest winter
Statistics will give you the truest picture of the youth
The visionary’s on a mission for new beginnings
It’s hard enough when you radiate a twenty block radius
Wondering who the father of the baby is
To pay relationships to her like sound fiction out to table
And public you write a buy you and provide it with the title
Body of a woman with the eyes of a child
Driven that she could—is it now
Want her future to be as bright as a smile
She like I see her spinning that Wheel of Fortune, let’s buy a vowel

[Chorus: Sample + Talib Kweli]
"She's got her ticket, I think she gonna use it" (Let's buy another one)
"I think she goin' to fly away
No one should try and stop her, persuade her with their power" (Come on)
"She says that her mind is made"

[Bridge: Talib Kweli]
Hold up

I realized early that black girls carry universes inside their bodies
Waiting to be named whole continent
Land masses that were once connected
Flow through her arms fingers, chest, legs, stomach
Feet and head
Ghanna is her heart, her lungs charity
Her tongue I'm.., her bones massai
Her breath Aboriginal her skin the color of Moroccan
Sand in south african sky lines
Her blue blood separates the land fro our riversand great legs
The place where we shit and drink
The place that we love and hate
Colonize and liberate
Conquer and rebuilt right and so up
Escape and imprisoned
The place where questions like if you a woman
Raise your hand will get you killed
