(Yeah)
(What's Happenin'?)
(What's Happenin'?)
(What's up, what's happenin, what's up?)

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
All my rap friends went crazy
I'm the last one left
These haters prayin' they can celebrate
The last one's death
None of them niggas in my class
That couldn't pass one test
But that's what happens
When you rappin' on that "have some depth"
I never chat shit
The flow bat-shit, it's major league
Major Keys like Khaled (it's accreate)
Recognize a dime when you pass it
With this weapon I's rhymin'
I'm an assassin
Put nine minutes to the casket
You bastards
Stare in the abyss and the Leviathan (oh yea)
You say a prayer for the dying men
Looking for that pleasure but you findin' sin
Can't be scared to take a loss if you tryin' to win

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Recognize greatness
Tenacious, gracious
Mark of design, the new Matrix
I can make Dr. Strange brain look basic
MCs on the dinner menu and I ain't ate shit
Who's the entree? I'm a giant like Andre
You just an appetizer
Weak rapper in harm's way
These elite rhymes, prayers and peace signs
Staring at the air
Fled the joint, hope the beast died
Icy ass road
No brakes let the Jeep slide
Playing hide and seek with my sleep
Where did he hide?
Popular, hood philosopher since knee high
Ironic, I really ran with the wolves at G high
You ain't hearing me
Higher power preparing me
To have a higher power in rap for transparency
I'm clear to you
I'm here with you
High and in the cloud
I should put it in the air for you

[Hook: Talib Kweli & Styles P]
All my rap friends went crazy I'm the last one left
All my street homies crazy I'm the last one right
(Last ones, left right)
(Last ones, left right)
All my rap friends went crazy I'm the last one left
All my street homies crazy I'm the last one right
(Last ones, left right)
(Last ones, left right)
(Last ones)

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Paint her like I'm JJ
For real I'm not for play play
If I work then I get paid
They whip them slaves like the nae nae
I'm smashin' 'em, if you askin' 'em
What's happenin' then they say
I'm original, you a re-run
Dwayne, hey hey hey
Do the rise
Got my squad information
Like what Bey say
Yasiin, my brother, you got to be more specific
When you say Bey
A spark like a melee
Feelings I don't placate
Give a fuck what Michael Jackson
And Paul McCartney say say say
Fuck the KKK
Respect the family
Me and you got a play date
I'll send you to hell
And Satan will be your playmate
O-K-K, like Lil Scrappy
But pay attention to what they say
Sound like some old
"Catch me on payday" type niggas
Who like to get missin'
Nah, pay what you want (cough it up)
But you ain't the homie
Nah you don't know me
Hip-hop on my shoulders
Like the demons or the cherubim
The stick you use for measurin'
Way too sick for medicine

[Hook: Talib Kweli & Styles P]
All my rap friends went crazy I'm the last one left
All my street homies crazy I'm the last one right
(Last ones, left right)
(Last ones, left right)
All my rap friends went crazy I'm the last one left
All my street homies crazy I'm the last one right
(Last ones, left right)
(Last ones, left right)

[Verse 4: Styles P]
All my street homies crazy I'm the last one right
Hatin' cocksuckers hope I see the flash one night
'Bout peace but I'ma grab my mask tonight
Man standin', I'ma be the last one right
I rhyme wicked, I sit still, my mind vivid
Analyze the times and all of the signs with it
Pump fake the snakes and the rats and the swine with 'em
Smoke watch stars and go on the line with 'em, Ghost

[Outro]
Oh, that my words were written
Oh, that they were inscribed in a book
Oh, that with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever
Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just
Whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable
If there is any excellence, if there is anything worth of praise
Think about these things
