Snippet

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, new niggas, man
Uh

Niggas wanna play both sides
Like both sides got very fine people
One side is fightin' Klan and the Nazis
The other side is straight evil
If people wantin’ to be equal is a threat to you
And equality is death to you
You're probably insecure about your testicles
We celebrate diversity with carnivals and festivals
When you all about the dollar bill
That philosophy'll probably kill
Intolerance is puttin’ people in the hospitals
Politicians makin' sure that you don't pay your doctor bills
Bush seen out here talkin' 'bout he David Copperfield
Malcolm X, bloodstained shoes are a lot to fill
Liberals keep tellin' us these Nazis is not for real
Tell that to the woman that they killed down in Charlottesville
Yellin', "Blood and soil"
Sayin', "Jews will not replace us"
What will it take before you call ’em racist?
Domestic terrorist, you...
