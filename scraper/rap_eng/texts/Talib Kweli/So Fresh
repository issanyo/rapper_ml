Attack the block
1 2, 1 2, 1 2
1 2, 1 2, 1 2
1 2 3 the place to be
With the almighty Talib Kweli
With the Z

My rhymes make love to be mike will get than never force it
I plant my seed to hate pregnant pauses
Work, perceive the blessing y'all I see the whole picture
While you only see sex
Get birth to this style like you to beat the computer
But I never play the moves is too much estate
Life is all bout what you do, you don't say
Every man got a cold this move we don't break
Gotta pay those dues you give me the whole V on trial for my view
Z-Trip my cold D never whore for the sister is pimping like OD
That's the man Jos√© you know how to hoes B
What is street, what is stuck on this throat
Now in the east trade froose when you punch on the trees
That ain't the peach I came through
But I'm not on the leaves
Change colors money please that's the rap like the..
In the state of emergency blood is the currency
They spill it on the ground until the mud turn burgundy
Hotter than Mercury, sharper than the scalpel the doctor perform a surgery
A rapper talk about they burning me
That's absurd they thought it never occur to me
I let it spit it first out the courtesy
Currently the best full of fresh to death because of murder beats
Because of murder beats, yeah

Yeah I raise the glass for those who raised the bar
Wait a while for those who probably catch what I say them all
I need a new challenge so I could utilize
My true talents running over tracks like some new balance
Will make the..rhymes work to provide got a new time for innocent rhymes
Get out the way have em on their needs
Asking their master when they feed em
None of them I am half of what I've been seeing
I know you say you pack what I laugh still
You only metal got in the lines that is for deals
You need to smack the kill this is snack for real
The shit is so so if you rap and the ..kill
I'm all seeing like the eyes on the back of bills
The black in the eyes of the shark when it attacks the seals
Keep it so fresh I got a scratched seal
You're the king I break the crown like Jack and Jill

SO so so so so so so fresh
SO so so so fresh
