[Intro: Q-Tip]
Wow, we in stereo?

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Question for the ages
What's going on with my rap pages?
Rappers wanna be down, but listen listen
You got to feel it within' your body and your spirit
When you listen to the rhythm, come on
It's the Abstract, Will is on the beat
Women all around the globe, the world
You got to follow me
Change your history, categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in there for my Black Eyed Peas
So watch it watch it, be marvelled of the speakers please
'Cause they gonna rumble and shake the ground
Break atoms, break a sound
Thunder and bass full pound
Streets with the things profound
If you wanna do to help you out
Make it cool around your friends without smoking now
Play the song kinda loud, it can help you out
And you could work it out, yeah you could work it out
It's like that, and a...

[Hook: will.i.am & (Cee-Lo Green)]
And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)
It's like that 'cause I got it like that

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
And I got it like that also
Got a style that's way out like Barstow
You know I'm known to cook a nigga like charcoal
Steady jumpin' round like it's heavy cargo
(Can I kick it?) Yup, really far though
From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tonto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
Kobe showed the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we Wells Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke herbs but I'm still real nice with the verbs
So [Fuck] (Hey!) what you heard
'Cause we got it like that

[Hook: will.i.am & (Cee-Lo Green)]
And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)
It's like that 'cause I got it like that
(Talib, just hit 'em like that)

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
I'm from the jungle, brother, and I got it like that
Yo, my life got me running through a maze like a white rat
I need a shot at Remy  like Mike Rap like to yack is the fights that got me spillin' on the right track
And I like this, Will, so I might get ill
On the mic somebody might get killed
So many dead rappers there's a cypher in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust, its the stuff of Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd o'cattle down Myrtle Avenue
Where we at ain't nothin pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a tooth
Stare into the Sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like Sake
My lyrics get out a split atoms like Hiroshima and Nagasaki

[Verse 4: apl.de.ap]
It's the apl.de.ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how we act, we attack any track
It's the Black Eyed Peas and we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills that rose in the past
We got it like how you know how to beast rocks
Entertain you, see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making nah hot shish and be shocking them out
Tss tsss tsss, I'mma roll with the hot
I'mma flow from the soul when you can't hold me back
Ke-ke-keep on keep on rolling the track
I'mma simply simply always attach
Jeepny music from by apl.de.ap
From L.A to Philippines we bridging the gap
We got it like that you know we got it like that
We got it like... like we got it like that y'all

[Hook: will.i.am & (Q-Tip)]
And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)
It's like that 'cause I got it like that
