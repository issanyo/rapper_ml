Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here

Every day I gotta wake up early
Let it break, thank the Lord at the take
Get the troops, hit the booth, spiritual, it's been great
Practicing my gratitude, life is so beautiful
Working on that attitude, just because

It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here

Every day I gotta
Trust the God and hustle hard
My grind is real, my hustle dope
I'm finding meals, I'm signing deals
I'm the Gladiator like Russell Crowe
Yeah, you know it's real, but I'm focused still
Why you focus shake it like gold field
Cause you're not in tune, no, you're not immune
No acclamation, no golden seal
You sick side, gotta flush it down
We talk to folks, cover your mouth
Ain't nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work, you tuff it down
You bust it out till you're out for work
I know your boss a jerk, you're gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut
That cock only think you punch him out
I relate to you, you gotta pay your dues
When the time is right you gotta make a move
Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what you're made to do
I got faith in you, you're gonna make it through
Cause you don't chase money, money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a thing to do
Won't taste no foods like they put you
No more wait for you, you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vault
As long as you walk on the earth with that first got to make me proud
Hey, let me break it down, oh, bless your hearts
Keep talking bout how stressed you are
Better talk about how blessed you are

Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here

Every day I got to get up early, wake the kids
Get on running made again
Go to work watching in
Every day I'm hustling
Fight the traffic, lose my cool
Get the kids right after school
Think it's hard, yeah, that's true
This is what I have to do

Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here

What we got is true they listen
Try to talk to gal but is real what I'm spitting
Call Christ by name but still ain't rising
Set to my lane but still ain't listening
Got ice in the vans we make so frigid
Still in the kill brain self when you hit it
Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that
Don't stop, get it, get it
Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain't living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanks Giving
We love that color 25% more like we like to face prison
But just because the president was black there's no racism?
Postracial? More like most racial
They hate for you disgraceful
Don't let them take you off your base, let them motivate you
Don't let it overtake you, so what another clause
Survive the storm but riding on the beach in the southern wild

Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
