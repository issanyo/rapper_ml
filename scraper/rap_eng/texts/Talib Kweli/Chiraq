[Verse]
Been a double murder, been a couple shootin'
Niggas droppin' bodies in a couple ways
Abandon children cause they daddies dyin'
Mommas bury sons every couple day
Know some newlyweds think of movin' here
But they visit here and not a couple stay
Father murdered bout 30 shots every bullet enter not one was grazed
At the funeral when they pullin' up
Niggas enemies and they showin' up
When I looked up I was shooked up
My dead daddy's body all swollen up
Nothin is new just a different day
Same reckless killin, different face
Niggas excited addicted to violence and not realising
They won't get to age
Too many of us not doin' enough
They scheming and plotting bout fillin' the spots in the prison
We killin like our only option is poppin' a nigga all over a prop
I'm sick of all of this shit
Horrifying and vicious
So disgusted in these Chiraq hoes all glorifying-ass bitches
So basically you telling me
Death could come from an argument
Killin' little kids ain't a part of this
Hit your muthafuckin target bitch
So fed up don't wanna talk no more
Shit is fucked up when a park is down the street
And a group of adolescents can't walk no more
Varying expiration from a nigga with no patience or no future aspirations
No spark no more
Didn't even know her, [?] no more
No one's safe, Chiraq shit
Twenty three, shots galore
Remember when the slaves get whacked with whips?
Now we gettin' whackin' one another outta whips
Grammar school, fruit snacks and chips
Lil' nigga got book bag packed with clips
This shit is coo-coo, coo-coo crazy
Free my nigga, goo-goo baby
Life is precious, this shit is real
They settin' traps for us to kill
So they don't have to, sit back and laugh
Through this Chiraq bloodshed
Here we have on the grass, yellow tape
Bloody streets, black complexion
Solo shorties, parents absent
Hardly soldiers, souls neglected
Life is somethin' you cannot buy back
I fuck but why die, anti Chiraq
