[Intro: Sizzla] + {Talib Kweli}
Deliver me oh my father
Haha, Amadea {C'mon!}
Sizzla Kalonji {Yeah, this the one right here!}
Talib Kweli

[Hook: Talib Kweli] + {Sizzla}
{Deliver me oh my father}
What? What? Yeah
Deliver me from temptation, a weakened man facin
You put the spirit in me, I feel the sensation

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Die on my feet before I live on my knees lord
Deliver me from point A to B like livery
Nothin is free, you got to be a hero to save
They got you working like a slave from the crib to the grave
A minimum wage can barely keep a job for a home
A car or a phone, forget about gettin a loan
You starting to moan, your bank account is getting withdrawn
It's pitiful how we becomin slaves to things that we own
They en-slavin the brains with the whips and the chains
End up in the coffin chasing the fortune, chasing the fame
Slave to the rhythm, slave to the night, slave to the day
They hop aboard the Underground Railroad and run away
Pray for the day niggas don't get taken away
For makin a way to stop their baby's stomach aching today
I sip a whiskey straight, no chase
It's hard to take a man away from the sin when it's inside of him
Please

[Hook: Talib Kweli] + {Sizzla}
{Deliver me oh my father}
Yes, yes
Deliver me from the evil that's all around me
Jamaica to King's County, God
{Deliver me oh my father}
Yes, yes, yes
Deliver me from temptation, a weakened man facin
You put the spirit in me, I feel the sensation

[Verse 2: Sizzla - best guess only]
Dance through my soul and let my days go right
He can preserve me all the days of my life
With the strength to wake through another day so bright
Oh! Kalonji, Talib
They say nothing's wrong with doing sin in your mind
I reach myself and see what's there for my kind
And look around and see, don't be acting blind
This is the birthing of us, it's just not kind
Now what's the worst thing a man could ever price
Pay his life for something he didn't do like the missing mice
Listen up, you know growing up I'll tell you something
He won't like you in the deepest of dungeon
Take away from my periods, leave me by myself
Life is like a dot com, but the blue in my eyes
Aired by your love from but your feuds are hopeless!
You got a lot of bid, that's how it went

[Hook: Talib Kweli] + {Sizzla}
{Deliver me oh my father}
What? What?
Deliver me from the evil that's all around me
Jamaica to King's County, God
{Deliver me oh my father}
Yes, yes, yes
Deliver me from temptation, a weakened man facin
You put the spirit in me, I feel the sensation

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Plug in the mic like I'm gunnin a bike
Front if you like, I'm movin fast, my life is runnin the lights
I give my son some advice
Eyes on the prize, keep more with the one in your sight
Won't win the gunfight if you brung you a knife
I'm drawin blood from the rock and keep floodin the block
With rhymes that are sharper than the razor that be cuttin the box
For sure I gotta move niggas with rocks in their socks
The prostitutes sellin the shit right in front of the cops
Under the street lamp, walking through the rain until our feet damp
Single moms all line at the office because they need stamps
Your cousin out of jail, he spent his time finding God
With a felony kinda charge it's kinda hard to find a job
He gotta make a decision, the situation he's placed in
As he's gotta get that gainful employment for his probation
Otherwise he's just another part of the scenery
Just because you got out of jail, that don't mean you free

[Hook: Talib Kweli] + {Sizzla}
{Deliver me oh my father}
What? What?
Deliver me from the evil that's all around me
Jamaica to King's County, God
{Deliver me oh my father}

[Sizzla]
Gotta survive and sustain and that ain't right
And everywhere you go they want to give you a fight
Gotta survive and sustain and that's for sure
And every minute sees I'm coming at the bar
Oh yeah...
I got to reach out and look
And keep my seed by my side
Uh, yeah
Life's a reality
Sizzla Kalonji, Talib Kweli
