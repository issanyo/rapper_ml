"When I program the sound, I..."

[Talib Kweli]
Oh, oh (what it is)
Oh (what it was), yeah (what it will be)
Oh, oh (Kweli, Hi-Tek), oh

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
We gon' set it off (hey), we gon' set it off (hey)
Something on my chest and I gotta get it off
So we gon' let it off (hey), catch it like a cough
A-ha, a-ha, ay, cause the flow so ill
But I feel so good, I feel so good (oh I feel good)
I feel so good, I feel so good
Man I feel so good, feel so good (like when you finish working out)
Feel so good, feel so good, yeah (or when your girl cummin before you do)

[Talib Kweli]
Every time I hit the block, the shepherd come and get the flock
I roll a +Jay+, I get a +Dame+, I do it +B.I.G.+ like it's the Roc
It's not, it's the Blacksmith, we finna pick the lock
On fire like the trunk is popped, go to work, punch the clock
The flow so sick it's ill, so they lose they lunch a lot
Sick so they front a lot, sick cause they want the spot
Get 'em higher, light the fire, woop! Time's running out
Spacious pan again, he in the closet, he ain't coming out
That's cause I'm invading like Iraq did to it's neighbours
Nothing black and white, they acting like Barack is gonna save us
But, first they got to save themselves from playing the game, they play themselves
You a non-believer, I'm a Libra so I weigh the scales

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
We gon' set it off
Something on my chest and I gotta get it off
So we gon' let it off, catch it like a cough
A-ha, a-ha, ay, cause the flow so ill

[Talib Kweli]
But forget it, I'm a boss, I said it all before
The flow is so butter, you can spread it on your toast
When I send this out to Los', he gon' say this shit is banging (why is it banging?)
The Devil play me close and I'mma hang him like a painting
You can check out my exhibit, won't you pay a fee to see it?
This is the masterpiece, every album a museum
When I bring my people freedom, they gon' smile like Mona Lisa
I'm married to the game, throwing the rice like condoleezza

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
We gon' set it off, we gon' set it off
Something on my chest and I gotta get it off
So we gon' let it off, catch it like a cough
A-ha, a-ha, ay, cause the flow so ill
But I feel so good, I feel so good
I feel so good, I feel so good
Man I feel so good, feel so good
Feel so good, feel so good, yeah

[Hi-Tek]
Aiyyo, every time I'm out on these streets, y'all niggas know the deal
I'm rolling with my nigga Kweli, I let him hold the wheel
So I can get a couple of shots, let it off
Head it off in the general direction, then set it off
But of course Brooklyn and Cincinnati is in the house
And it's Hi-Tek, hardest for niggas to figure out
Pick a route, people stab you in the back for the stardom
But they fall right back to the bottom like cats in Roddam
But I'm flying through the night like a pilot with insomnia
Burn up on your deck like a pirate from Somalia
Hi-Teknology, better school your producer
And can't be duplicated by computer

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
We gon' set it off, we gon' set it off
Something on my chest and I gotta get it off
So we gon' let it off, catch it like a cough
A-ha, a-ha, ay, cause the flow so ill
But I feel so good, I feel so good
I feel so good, I feel so good
Man I feel so good, feel so good
Feel so good, feel so good, yeah

[Talib Kweli]
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, we gon' set it off
