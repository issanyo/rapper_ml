[Intro: Talib Kweli]
I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
This path got hurdles
Smoke rappers to make up for the herbal
It's quite fertile after 4 months of murder
I push em to the edge, now they sanity is sorta
Missin', I guess I'm that gifted
Why I never celebrated damn Christmas
I been the rap game wishlist
The morticians boomin' business
These bitches still bitchin'
Sad day for you, there's no love?
Here, you better ask grandma, she can pray for you
You just pray to me
I just react like 8 Uzis, blow holes in your plan like [?]
Love to Ruby Dee in Sicily
I pray I'm just as strong as on when I turn 60
Hope my health good and I ain't sickly
Pray with news, no other icons
Like we lost Whitney, and maybe [?] you'll get my age right
Maybe one of these months, I'll sleep all night
And if I don't, it's alright

[Hook: Rapsody]
I got my whole life ahead of me, I know this world ain't heavenly
I'm just following this little recipe
I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me, I know this world ain't heavenly
I'm just following this lil' recipe

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Stack chips like the treasury
Nigga swear they  ballin' like they 7 feet
Like John Lennon, just let it be
(I got my whole life ahead of me)
I judge a man by his enemies
Rapsody my sister, 9th my brother like the Everly's
Indie 5, the best emcees of recent memory
I'm a connector, that's my speciality
I'm a plug with the drugs like the Genovese
They try to kill the poor, I got the remedy
That's why I fought the law damn Kennedy's
They try to pull a rug right from under you
Buggin' you like a centipede
Even tho it tie the room together nicely like a centerpiece
Try to pretend you're passive but actually act aggressively
Try to take away my energy, save it like Dennis Eckersley
These niggas thirsty as a speech was in Tennessee [?]
You girl messaged me, calling me bae like the Chesapeake
But never stop testing me
But their chances of besting of me is futile as looking for some honour in a den of thieves
Black Star my body of work is heavenly
Death tries it's best to keep up cause life's ahead of me

[Hook: Rapsody]
I got my whole life ahead of me, I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me
I know this world ain't heavenly, I'm just following this little recipe
I got my whole life ahead of me, I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me
I know this world ain't heavenly, I'm just following this lil' recipe

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
How slow can you be, I been killin' annually
I'm half beast machine
I guess Hills or Jeans make a difference
If they listen or pay attention, I'm in adventure, fuck you niggas
If I had a penis, your penis would be hard as a brick is
Say I'm king on some rap shit
But my gender got them tender I recognize y'all lies
And understand it ain't even, ain't no 5+5's
Ain't no more cries like Mary Blige and them
Pressure part of the process, like all them diamonds been
So what Iâ€™m finding is the more they keep rhyming
They break promises
I never like a female rapper that ain't honest, if  it now
If they never saw my profile, they probably picture me with a image
That do resemble dissing like cymbals
Make much noise
And rejoice with Cristal
We found the next boy
But not really, though
I'm still killin'  them easy, like eenie miny moe

[Hook: Rapsody]
I got my whole life ahead of me
I know this world ain't heavenly, I'm just following this little recipe
I got my whole life ahead of me, I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me
I know this world ain't heavenly, I'm just following this lil' recipe
I got my whole life ahead of me, I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me
I know this world ain't heavenly, I'm just following this lil' recipe
I got my whole life ahead of me, I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me, I got my whole life ahead of me
I got my whole life ahead of me
