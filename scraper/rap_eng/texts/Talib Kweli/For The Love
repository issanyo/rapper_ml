Gods cursing demons, Mars versus Venus
Surprised I'm still here like I'm yt&tenus
So pile up a revolution who won't stop until the solution
I stay winning 'cause losing ain't part of my constitution
When music has start a movement I'm stepping up to the play
They've got a lot of excuses, so ways are maybe in the way
For the real that you can feel when it's one knuckling your bone
Buy y'all was to write a poem to feel inviting as a home
So we started from the bottom with bombing on sound bombing
Bonding with living legends ingesting the top rhyming
Now the stage is my crib and the fam could throw it up
I spit it for the love I get paid for showing up
Yeah, I'm a main and I'm a prime
Aging like fine wine while I'm gauging my timeline
Still like agent provide the tour, when we make it and drive the tour
And I answer when opportunities be knocking at the door

I do it for the love, I do it for the love!
I do it for the love, I do it for the love!
Spit it for the love, for the love
I do it for the love, I do it for the love!
I do it for the love, I do it for the love!
