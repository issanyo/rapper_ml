[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Every year they say I'm back, but I never left you
My shit is next level, I raise the threat level
I got a permanent spot in the top ten
I live there, you corny niggas just drop in
You super lame, you don't really understand music
The true remain, and you hate it because you can't do it
You transparent, they can't stand it, the fans boo it
Your chick the finish line: the whole hood ran through it
She try to act like Cinderella but that ho frontin'
End of the night her toes bunion, coach become a pumpkin
They wanna act like I owe em somethin', I don't owe em nothin'
Watch you niggas break fast like they toast butter
A perfect storm and the coast is flooded
Mos discovered that my flow is gutter
You posers sound like your growth is stunted
Rap snitches diggin' ditches, working undercover
Real recognize real, we don't know each other

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
It's that new guy, all I do is make trouble
On some pills, now it's soundin' like the bass muffled
Just a normal dude, focused with a straight hustle
I'm down to Earth yo, Challenger space shuttle
Blue collar and cold as a Coolatta
I'm the king up in the burbs so they callin' me Mufasa
Kill it on the mic and I do what I do proper
Just watch when I'm rocking like bada-bing bada-boom mama
I'm an animal, ferocious, I don't suggest you approach it
Or provoke it, cause the last time the doctor gave a prognosis
He said I was out my fuckin' mind in case you hadn't noticed
So just pass me my bottle of Adderall so I can focus
And some bomb tree, cause it's C-Webby and Kweli
Here to drop heat, so the wack rappers they gwan leave
Baby watch me, cause until I'm on the top seat
I'ma kill em and no one can stop me, motherfucker

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Y'all in trouble, I ain't even get my feet wet
You know how much sweet flesh my teeth get these beats just
Seasoning, no reasoning, primalistic defeat again
When we begin to walk leaves fall from all of the trees and then Weaker men was raised their head to peek within the valley
Pterodactyl, beat screech, leeches swim and stampede begins
Me and them, same species different creature
When I bleed this pen just know you're breathing in Joell Ortiz and em
Occupy the top of the food chain, you bottom feeder
I'm on fire, they barely warm: koala fever
I ain't even at my hottest either, y'all been lally gaggin'
Poppin molly, dressing drag, playing follow the leader
Me I've been bodying speakers, catching a body and beatin' em
Fucking buffied up bodies in Bali on holiday weekends
Your bitches do karate, they chopped and you probably eatin' em
Nasty, nigga
