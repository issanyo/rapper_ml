[Intro]
The proud. Stand tall or don't stand at all, come on. Uhh, yeah. Break it down. What we do?

[Hook]
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

[Interlude]
June 11, 2001. Timothy McVeigh is executed and the country breathe a sigh of relief. Goodness prevails over evil, it seems. Somehow when he's gone, we feel safer. Little do we know

[Verse 1]
Today the paper say Timothy McVeigh's in hell
So everything's okay and all must be well
I remember Oklahoma when they put out the blaze
And put Islamic terrorist bombing, on the front page
It's like saying only gays get AIDS, propaganda
Like saying the problem's over when they locked that man up
Wrong! It's just the beginning, the first inning
Battle for America's soul, the devil's winning
The President is Bush, the Vice President's a Dick
So a whole lot of fucking is what we gon' get
They don't wanna raise the babies, so the election is fixed
That's why we don't be fucking with politics
They bet on that, parents fought and got wet for that
Hosed down, bit by dogs, and got blacks into house arrest for that
It's all good except for that, we still poor
Money, power and respect is what we kill for, for real

[Hook]
It's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

[Interlude]
August 4, 2001. A drunken police officer mows down an entire family in Brooklyn. The judge lets him go with no bail. It reminds us, of just how worthless our lives are to the justice system. I struggle, to explain the situation to my son, it's hard

[Verse 2]
Niggas with knowledge is more dangerous than than niggas with guns
They make the guns easy to get and try to keep niggas dumb
Target the gangs and graffiti with the Prop 21
I already know the deal, but what the fuck do I tell my son?
I want him living right, living good, respect the rules
He's five years old and he still thinking cops is cool
How do I break the news that when he gets some size
He'll be perceived as a threat or see the fear in they eyes
It's in they job description to terminate the threat
So 41 shots to the body is what he can expect
The precedent is set, don't matter if he follow the law
I know I'll give my son pride and make him swallow it all (Damn!)
Fuck the pigs! I think the pigs killed Big and 'Pac too
If they didn't they know who did, they got to!
Who they serve and protect, nigga not you
Cops shot off of ten G's, but they got Glocks too
Let you protect yourself, or better yet respect yourself
Straight into the hospital is where you gotta check yourself
They be getting tips from snitches and rival crews
Doing them favors, so they working for the drug dealers too
Just business enforcers with hate in they holsters
Shoot you in the back, won't face you like a soldier
Kurt Loder asked me what I say to a dead cop's wife
Cops kill my people everyday, that's life

[Hook]
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

[Interlude]
September 11, 2001. Terrorists attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center kills thousands and permanently scars America's false sense of security. We see the best examples of humanity in the face of the worst. As firefighters, police officers, rescue workers and volunteers of all sorts, fight to save lives. The world will never be the same again

[Verse 3]
My heart go out to everybody at Ground Zero
Red, black, yellow, white and brown heroes
It's more complicated than black and white
To give your own life is the greatest sacrifice
But it's hard for me to walk down the block
Seeing rats and roaches, crack viles and 40 ounce posters
People broken down from years of oppression
Become patriots when they way of life is threatened
It's a hard conversation to have
We lost kids, moms and dads, people ready to fight for the flag
Damn, when did shit get this bad?
America kill the innocent too, the cycle of violence is sad
Damn! Welcome to the world, we here
We've been at, war for years but it's much more clear
We got to face what lies ahead
Fight for our truth and freedom and, ride for the dead

[Hook]
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
