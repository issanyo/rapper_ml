[Intro: Estelle & John Legend]
Ooh, said I love and I love and I love to be free
Hmm, ooh ooh, hmm

[Chorus: Estelle & John Legend]
Said we're free to live and love again
[?]
This can be solved, just find it in your soul
Come get your free, come get your freedom

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Everything that I do will stay true to me
Wanna see what it's like to be truly free? (Uh huh)
From the pain and the strife that come with chasin' what you see in magazines and on the TV
I knew this kid named Mike, he used to slang white
Not for the fame where he lived, shit just ain't right
Snitches throwin' salt in the game
Mike saw police and drug dealers all in the same light
Now you're like "Is this what God's handing me?"
Take it and run, son, you're feeding your family
Flash the heat and you speak with profanity
Shit is so crazy, he pleaded insanity
Paying the cops, Mike break into more
Then his [?] then that make him a boss
He seeing the world and meeting them girls
He's buyin' them clothes and takin' them off
Now he got [?] in the fly crib
Take a step back like "Take a look at what I did"
Only rockin' fly shit like some sort of fetal Corleone, Tony Montana hybrid
Feelin' [?], hot tropical, beach properties
Make a morning, lawyers or how doctors do (Woo)
Donatin' libraries and hospitals, he got the donut and in the streets, it's impossible
Gettin' old, now he at a crossroad
Tryna find a reason for his tortured soul
Tryna slay these demons that be screamin' in his ear
Was it worth his wait and go?
All that he wanted was to take it home but in his old age
Time made it known that when the paper chase is on, you can easily become a slave at what you own

[Chorus: Estelle & John Legend]
Said we're free to live and love again
[?]
This can be solved, just find it in your soul
Come get your free, come get your freedom

[Verse 2: Estelle]
Now we're making chains til it hasn't changed
Now my wrist is bling, I'm still suffering
Yep, I feel your pain
When you gotta move out, your own ends will get killed by another gang
Since the day I'm born, this is all I know
Been through chasing bones, singing sticks and stone
But in sticks, I'm grown
Made me find a home
Never a tell a ho, so believe your son
I ain't judgin', I'm telling you real is real
Never had a dad so I know how you feel
But what matters most is you choose your role
Yappin' your the one so I know you're grown
You ain't on your own, buildings standin' with ya'
It's a pretty picture in the words that's scripted
Misses, mistle, mister, set your own rules 'cause your free to choose

[Chorus: Estelle & John Legend]
Said we're free to live and love again
[?]
This can be solved, just find it in your soul
Come get your free, come get your freedom

[Bridge]
So much is going on in the world while you're waitin' around
When you're waitin' around
Someone to give you a hand
Take it
You can take it, ohh

[Chorus: Estelle & John Legend]
Said we're free to live and love again
[?]
This can be solved, just find it in your soul
Come get your free, come get your freedom

[Outro: Estelle & John Legend]
This is for the people
This is for the people
You don't have to kill nobody
You don't have to kill nobody
You don't have to kill nobody
You- don't- have- to-
This is for the people
This is for the people
This is for the people
