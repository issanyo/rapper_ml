[Intro: Dave Chappelle as Rick James]
Turn my mothafuckin’ headphones up
Are they up? Louder, even louder than this (Kweli)
(Welcome to the Grand…)

Bitches, this is Rick James, that’s right bitch, the real Rick James. I’m Rick James bitch. One of the baddest mothafuckers you’ve ever seen when and one of the best-lookin motherfuckas, one of the best singers. This is the mixtape bitches. Sit back, relax, and enjoy yourself bitches. It’s a celebration. (Kweli!)

[Talib Kweli]
Step up front to my nigga Mos Def
Step up front to my man Hi-Tek
Step up front to my nigga CornBread
Step up front to my people, weak G
Step up front
Step up front
Hurry, Hurry, step right up
The show is about to begin
It’s a struggle, but it’s a beautiful struggle
Yea
