[Talib Kweli]
Yeah
Ladies, make it hot, girls, make it hot {*3X*}

Mr. International, passport pimpin
City street dweller every asphault different
Hittin with Jean and The Roots, my man Black Thought rippin
Now a glass goes whistlin, my rap flow's switchin up
Wait~! The promoter bitchin, is this asshole trippin?
Why my cash flow missin?
Don't fuck around this is how I make a livin
Stop, listen, get the guap'
My kids can't eat my love for hip-hop
This ain't the circus, I don't see no big top
So - who ya tryin to clown your money like Chris Rock
Don't make me laugh wit'cha funny money

Yeah, uhh, yeah, hehehehehe, ehyeah, yo

These promoters shady and they good for broken promises
Some of them scared of the hood so they only promote the colleges
I'm havin problems with excuses
Especially when it comes to my money and the contract is exclusive
They sell the tickets wit'cha name up in lights an' shit
But when it's time to pay they came up with all type of shit
Or tried to pay me in marijuana
The crowd was so thin he blamed Osama and the Twin Tower bombers
In my pocket like a thief and there ain't no honor
Livin all reckless like there ain't no karma
You ain't on punishment, I ain't your momma
I just had to expose the truth like Leonardo DaVinci when he paint Madonna

Hey, hey heyyyy, c'mon, uhh, whoa

Illegal business control America
Illegal immigration, gun control hysteria
The war on terror, war on drug, now everybody have vices
So we still gettin higher than gas prices
Yeah we have righteous MC's, ready to infilitrate
The system like a disease and bring it right to its knees
Who ain't fuckin with the pay for play, that shit is gay
Get down with Blacksmith or get the fuck out the way
E'rything's straight! Just get out from under the table
I'm not a pimp runnin a stable
I'm a kid with a vision runnin a label
With the freshest MC's with somethin to say too
We cuttin the umbilical cord from the navel
Willin and able to change the game for the better
A lot of crews claim they together
Then they fall apart and blame it on cheddar
Please~! I stay professional in all my endeavors
So we about to blow like Parliament in "V for Vendetta"
They try to get you with the funny money
