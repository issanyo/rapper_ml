Yeah special dedication
Im sending this one out to you and you and you and you
I said to you and you and you
She cold blooded, love how we melting the ice
You like the sunshine of my life, cause all see is a
A hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang,and you my hot thang , word
You keep my dark sky light up at night
So bright that you blinding my sight
Cause all I see is a
Hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, word
Your body's like a flick, it's got suprising twists
I write the script, the main characters your thighs and hips
Award for less important role with your eyes and lips
The way you move your body got em stiff like a hieroglyph
I watch you dance across the floor to the title track
You about to get me off the wall like you Michael Jack
Ill make describing your beauty my sacred duty
I will write a song, write a book, write a play, make a movie

Hey, hey, hey special dedication

[Chorus]
(Will.i.am)
Good love you a sexy thang, and all im saying
Is you got somthing I like

Good love you a sexy thang, and all im saying
Is you got somthing I like

(Talib)
Yo, I love ya country ass, I love ya city sass
I love how ya normal ways you catch it pretty fast
These dudes is pretty crass, harass you in ya past
I love how you snap back and get the last laugh
I love the way you crib smell like ______ candle incents
The white that you use on the phone when you handle business
I love it when you freaky
I love it when you a lady
Rockin doing ____ in the late 80's raising babies
I love her God bless you
Your body something special
I love to play connect the dots with yo facial freckles
No need for fashion police because I love your style
Whatever happen Shanese baby I love your smile
I might be fallen in love, should I let her know
A pimp told me if I love her I should let her go
I sing the praises everytime I play this instrumental
Cause you instrumental to my life, to my life, to my...

Hey, Hey, Hey special dedication

[Chorus]
I love how we melting the ice you like the sunshine of my life
Cause all I see is a
Hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, word
You keep my dark sky light up at night
So bright that you blinding my sight
Cause all I see is a
Hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, and you my hot thang, word
Let me take you by the hand you need to try your man to fight and dance and have your groupie doubt like excited fans
I promise you'll be climbing walls like spider-man
Knees buckling you'll hit the floor when you try to stand
So you drop it like its hot oh so heavy
You and me we can leave now we can go steady
How bout we be jetty cause im so ready
To bounce like a 64 chevy, word

Hey, Hey, Hey special dedication

[Chorus]
