Make your movie in hd, bet you ain't in a saga
Me, I'm a slinger, you a singer like Lady Gaga
I could see through you 'bout as clear as CÃ®roc vodka
I got [?] your teeth with the back of the mic, propper
And I don't give a fuck about a chopper
Leave you in the doctor; I popped Phil [?] with Big Poppa
Make sixteens [?] I call oscars for actors
Getting your neck in the back like chiropractors
I'm so nice I could give you a fact backwards
[...] hardest [...]
Keep your kids close, sick when i was nine years old
Ask my kin folks
My peoples been broke, a couple been rich
If rap was jail I'd be running the whole pen, bitch!
Ghost, Talib and Jean Grae; X-Men of hip hop
Still rock harder than Green Day
Classic, like vinyl, [?] for let the machine spray

Chorus:
Come on ...in your pocket!
Be a super star... you've got to...
Damn i got cream in the black socks, it's chocolate
Stop it, before you say something...
Rock, rock, drop it in the block
Rock, rock, drop it in the block
Rock, rock, drop it in the block!

No it's not, like charlie .we got a...
In his pocket treat and trick or treating
.i'm a...
I'm for... a freaky genie!
Jean is a genie, hideous, . sweety and i'm a queen
I'ma a swing open like lamborghini door to, pause to
My job is to floor you
Block you and ignore you
Pop you like a black whole
I like rock more
You're watching me like rock, ...
Just pop, so i'm just ...
.a good thing, i'm glad i put the hammer to it
My... will handle this!
Man, she did it to you!
Well, they say...
.worse than, doing...
I'm at my momma's house
With this little rocket, now jesus!
Put my fingers and to stick them in the socket, now!
I rather be dead than wash my shit
Call the gone... filling the dirt, tell them my
Ten buckets, and it's all your fault
I'm rotting, shouldn't have done that, a lot about...
It's all your fault i'm rotting
You shouldn't have done that...

Chorus:
What is it, ... you're trying to lose your life?
...but i'm foolish on the mike
Know the truth, i dispute it, cause i do it how i like!
... from the bike!
Nice try, you ain't fly, you're lying on the ...
.but your local iq
...don't work
Even though they're soaking on your ...
If you don't work, you don't eat
You fuck around and get high on the...
Try to compete, you're done beat
. before you even started
Everybody knows you're number four...
.and making no sense!
The way i put these rappers, so ugly, the flow is grotesque
Your blow is .it's no context
You will fall...
What are you a friend or you're a foe?
White kind of energy you provoke to keep my enemies close?
I got a tendency to smoke and i stay in the mix like... and coke!

Chorus:
