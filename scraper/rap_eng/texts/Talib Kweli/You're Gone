[Intro: Colin Munroe]
I'm right, you're gone
I'm right, you're gone
I'm right. you're gone
I'm right, you're gone

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Start up a party like arsonists start a fire
Sharper than barb wire, lyrical jambalaya
I'm nice like Stoudemire with the rock
Peep it I'm the sheppard, they admiring the flock
Niggas is sheepish, secretive, so mysterious
Claimin' that you're Blood, but you're really on your period
Claimin' that you're Crip but nothing is wrong with ya
We'll except you're real dumb, you fucked with the wrong niggas
Man fuck it my songs is thicker than catalogs
Walk towards the light, shine so bright you need a parasol
They try to laugh, rappers dying faster than ants under the magnifying glass
This is iconoclast, find a lab everywhere I go
Leave faces on the flo' everywhere I flow, ?
The beat is knockin' but the information make the speakers blow
They keep it on the low
But I know my people need it though

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
Just don't call me evil
And don't call it ego
And I'm right (I'm right)
And you're gone (you're gone)
It don't mean I'm evil
And don't mean it's ego
Cause  I'm right (I'm right)
And you're gone (you're gone)

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Yo, the flow is maple syrup
Take a tour of Europe
So I can make a buck, make it plural
Cakin' cause I'm taking Euros
Instead of dollars I invest in better products
Man, experience a better college
I still connect with scholars
Even though I'm still in these streets, I'm like a local expert
You'll blog about me on your social network
There ain't no fairytale, ain't no glass slipper, no Cinderella
The education real like ? in the favela
Developed to where my pen is my favorite weapon
It's all Brooklyn, I'm a Warrior like M.O.P. and game rebellion
My name is (Talib!)
My name is mentioned with the greats
You already know the name
Pay attention to the face
This the face of the music to feed your mind and your body simultaneously
The evolution of the brainy MC
They pay a fee so you respect the hustle
The way I write got extra muscle
Work it out

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Lil' Fame]
Yo, I'm stuck in analog trying to go digital
Fizzy Womack, 'nificient, work miracles
Up in Statik crib, ShowOff
Back in the days you get your motherfuckin' head blown off
Take this German coat off
Nugget watch bitch, piece and your herringbone off
Hop in the Cadillac Seville and roll off
I get down like a niggy in an up north flick
Green and white shell toes you know the up north kicks
I'm alive with aggression
I ride with obsession
We made it through the 80's
Shit I'mma survive the recession
Government, you find me in a pinch
Suge Knight record deals, fuck it, sign me in the pen
One of my sons favorite rappers is aaaah
Next up is Talib
But guess what, my son's first name is Kwe
Mo mo mo P, keep the blazin' the chrome
With Statik Selektah, Population Control
C'mon

[Hook:]
