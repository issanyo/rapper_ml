[Verse: Res]
Now here you go again, you say
You want your freedom
Now who am I to keep you down
It's only right that you should
Play it the way that you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost, but you know what you had
Now you know what you lost

[Chorus: Res]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
And they say women we will come and we will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know
You'll know, you'll know
