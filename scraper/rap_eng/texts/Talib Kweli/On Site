[Intro: Krondon]
Strong Arm Steady, size ain't shit
(Laughs) Yeah! S-A-S nigga!
Sock a sucka down, Talib Kweli
It's a beautiful mothafuckin' struggle if I do say so myself
My name is Dizzalean, Krondon Dizzle, Phil Da Agony, Talib Kweli
Yuh, let's go! Come on!

[Chorus: Krondon]
You brought a knife to the gunfight
It has no way to win the war
Your smarter then that
In the hood you know it's on, on-site
What you gonna do
When the big bad gang coming knocking down your door
You can call the law, but you better run for your life
I'm telling you

[Verse 1: Phil Da Agony]
If I don't say so myself who will we
Master the skill the real coming at you for real
Real Kweli, Dizzle, and Phil
And you know I stay steady write a million dollar rap in my will
Winning a war, pinning Timberlands on tour
Resemble nothing similar to what you heard before
Let's make some cold shit, bring back all the old shit
Get this money till we can't fold it, fuck it!
Provocativeness mixed with a twist of this Backwood
Do it for the hood Y'all some goody good fake ass brotherhood shit
Me and my niggas on some Rowdy Rowdy Piper fuck a cypher pay the piper
De-cypher what I wrote we got them bottles out there break on boats
Take notes, Shrek tooth speak on my dope
[?] reap what you wrote
So don't say nothing when we on your doorstep
When you peep through the hole
Steady

[Chorus: Krondon]
You brought a knife to the gunfight
It has no way to win the war
Your smarter then that
In the hood you know it's on, on-site
What you gonna do
When the big bad gang coming knocking down your door
You can call the law, but you better run for your life
I'm telling you

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
