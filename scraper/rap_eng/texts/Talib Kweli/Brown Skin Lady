And everybody on the avenue I know, when they see her say
Everybody on the avenue I know, when they see her say
There she is

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Fresher than Tony Rebel's vegetables at African street festivals
Where incredible women is, plentiful
Over the years I met a few, none of them compare to you
Preparing you to make fruit bearable, somethin terrible, let's see:
You fruitful, beautiful, smart, lovable, huggable
Doable like art, suitable to be part
Of my life, Coppertone owe you copyright infringement, pay
You been this tan since way back in the day
It's like I'm standin there you know appreciatin God's design
And then you showed up, it's like you read my mind
DAMN SHE'S FINE, I think I add the R-E, in front of that
And see if she D, to get, with a cat like me

[Bridge: Mos Def and (Talib Kweli)]

[Verse 2 Mos Def]
Ooooh! Damn baby girl, look at you!
Comin on the block lookin fresh and brand new
Ooooh! Headwrap cover your hairdo
Pretty feet peekin through open-toed shoe
Ooooh! No limit to what I would do
Make love to you like long interview
Whooh! Is she for real, me like you
Good look champion, win the title
True, many man try invite you
Shot down lyric each time they cyph you
Jewel, what man, ya get born inside zoo?
Feet they walk way and just let she pass through
Ooooh! Can't be a next one like you
Famous like tapes made by DJ Clue
I tighten up my game as I approach you
Yo check her she the nectar the bee get close to

[Break]

[Verse 3: Talib]
I don't get many compliments, but I am confident
Used to have a complex about, gettin too complex
You got me, willin to try, looked me in the eye
My head is still in the sky, since you walked on by
I'm feelin high, got my imagination flickerin like hot flames
It's how it seems, you make me wanna ride the Coltrane to A Love Supreme
My brown lady, creates environments, for
Happy brown babies, I know it sounds crazy
But your skin's the inspiration for cocoa butter
You provoke a brother we should get to know one another
I discover when I bring you through my people say TRUE, all I can say
Is all praise due I thank you God for a beauty like you

She's a brown skinned lady
Such a brown skinned lady

[Outro: Talib]
Baby, what you mean you don't think you look good?
You know what some people put themselves through
To look just like you?
Dark stocking, high heels, lipstick, alla that
You know what?
Without makeup you're beautiful
Whatcha you need to paint the next face for
We're not dealin with the European standard of beauty tonight
Turn off the TV, put the magazine away
In the mirror tell me what you see
See the evidence of divine presence
Women in the, Caribbean, they got the, golden sun
I know women on the continent got it
Nigeria and Ghana, you know they got it
Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique
And Botswana, to let it speak
How 'bout Latinas, Colombianas
Cubanas, Dominicanas, Tahinians
Of course the Brooklyn women walk that walk
And the Bronx women walk that walk
Honies from Queens walk that walk
NYC, ATL, LA, Cincinnati, the Bay Area
Got the cocoa butter brown skinned ladies doing their thing in
London and Paris, cocoa butter brown sk...
