Damon Albarn:
Son, son what has become of your lawless heart, the right wing leaves shadows in your eyes
But she don't love me anymore, just too late for love

Gone, gone the stars have gone, spun out on the road, up to the big house on the hill
But she don't live there anymore, she's tired of waiting for me..

Talib Kweli:
There she goes (x3)

See, she was my manifesto

I love the California sun, we out in San Francisco

Your man official, how it bubble like a pot of Crisco
I never leave you in the hole, this ain't Apocalypto
Clearly you got some issues

Man she hit me in the heart with the pocket pistol

She said she's never coming back
Somehow I kinda missed her

Damon Albarn:
Oh Lord what have I done, what was my mistake
These tears are all I have to give
Cause she don't love me anymore, just too late for love..

(Inaudible chatter)
