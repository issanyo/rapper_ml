[Intro 3x]
Loud as a thunderstorm
That’s how the crown and some perform
It’s the new solar system like the sun is born
And we get animated like the guns is drawn

[Verse 1]
You say you’re a groom but you’re working for the law
Rebel for a cause, nah, rebel for a pause
Radio poppin off better *static* off
Fighting this feelin like fighting a war
I don’t really know what you’re fighting it for
All you're really doing is fighting yourself
Stick the gun back inside your bible belt
My arrival felt across this planet
When I landed jet lag on the flag I plant it
Face lit by the moon ima visit her soon
Get high if you knew get hit the truth
Kweli no nom de plume Lazer Major like Diplo tunes
Music it’s few and we’re running off fumes
I’ma visit your tomb if you get to west suit
That consciousness been a nigga
Ain’t ruggin it till you get beat with it get..
Self made niggas don’t get discovered
Well paid niggas don’t fit your..

[Hook]
I got a letter from the government the other day
I open and read it and said they was suckas
The devil wants me for his army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn I said never
I said never, I said never
I said never

[Verse 2]
War is overrated I see the soul full of hatred
No hesitation we just go there’s never no debating
We fighting over faith
We fighting for masters when we know they racist
When they looking for their help like we Viola Davis
Yeah self preservation is the motivation
Every soldier and my squad my brother know there’s no relation
They got my back in any altercation
That’s why I fight for them and never for the nation
Defiantly form alliances that the science is describing as
Violent applyin em to environmentsis nihilist by nature the alphas become omegas
Omegas become the leaders and vitamin of the hater
The politicians they checkin they voting to go invade you
Crusaders of dark ages in modern time, chasin Al-Qaeda
But can’t stop, shootings in Columbine
Look em in the eye you see dollar sign

[Hook]
I got a letter from the government the other day
I open and read it and said they was suckas
The devil wants me for his army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn I said never
I said never, I said never
I said never, I said never
I said never hey, never hey never hey
