Here we go

[Verse 1: Madlib]
It's J.A.Y L.I.B, Dilla dog hold the track
Hold the backs like ya backs amongst the raps
Hold the mac
(so, what's your roll in this music)
Man, the same questions
"I'm just trying to create new composition"
To innovate, the reinstate, a paperweight
To renovate, techniplate, to integrate
And playa hate, lay your fate, we keep it live
When we roll, 'cause we cold, coming in stereo
On the phone, get the ho, everywhere we go
And if not, nigga please on your mom
Trigger squeeze, on your knees
While I pop one of these
Like, no dose, or coke up in ya nose
Or weed up in ya lungs
Or heroin in your veins
You know i'm sober just by saying the name
It's all up in, all up in this game
So, what up ma you coming with me?
It's the J.A.Y L.I.B

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
Now everybody let's gather around
'Cause all we want to do is, just get on down now
I like my sound raw
I know you do too, cause on the down low
I'm fuckin' witchu

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
From the front to tha back
People jump to tha track
Cause they pumpin' like crack
Cause it's funk in the back
Cause the trunk gettin' track
Jump off, run back
Come back, cause they like that raw shit
They want that, jump back when I kiss myself
Like James Brown, got to lay down
It's not the same sound, it's not the playground
We hot, to spray around, shot the plane down
Got the place around, you held hostage
Two is get down shit, J.D, Madlib who I get down with
Sounds sicker then cheap
Vodka and brown liquor
Put it down when I get around, my out of town nigga

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
Now everybody, let's gather around
Cause all we want to do is, just get on down
I like my sound raw
I know you do too, cause on the down low
I'm fuckin' witchu

[Outro:]
