[Verse 1]
Flow dangerous
So be careful
They call it a game
But they don't play fair though
Hey, I don't care though
They can hangover
I, I stay here though always prepared
To sow the flow over your head
Call me a weirdo goodnight
These dudes going to bed
I go over the edge
And dove over the feds
Who being known where to lead
To never falling off, why?
I want to call up, bonsoir
Cause people looking surprised
Cause I caught em off guard
Blast look kinda harder
Tracks look like a rock
Dash it
We creating a classic
And we making the magic
We have faith, now sit
A lot this rap shit is fake and plastic
Take it back with
This right here
We keep it in the pocket
Keep it in the pocket

[Hook]
Keep it in the pocket
Stay in the pocket
Keep it in the pocket
Stay in the pocket
Keep it in the pocket
Stay in the pocket
Keep it in the pocket

Keep it in the pocket
Stay in the pocket
Keep it in the pocket
Stay in the pocket
We keeping it in the pocket
And staying in the pocket
And keeping it in the pocket
And staying

[Verse 2]
A lot of MCs like to use the word dramatical
Pardon the grammatical error
That was a powerful effort to
[?] now style radical era
When you was down to [?] but you was down to do it
Your crews run in the street like a new drug
Rappers nowadays all sensitive like group hugs
[?] hey your ride souped up
And let it fly, don't keep your chick cooped up
I know you afraid she'll get scooped up
Coming out to see your boy, she getting spruced up
Brooklyn, New York City where I grew up
In this industry there's really places you can lose touch
When you're used to the struggle, being beautiful
And coming through with the new style can be unusual
Cause using you like a woman who's seducing you
And soon the music that you were producing start producing you
Word to SB we stay fantastic
You wanna stay eye to eye, well I have it
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Hook]
