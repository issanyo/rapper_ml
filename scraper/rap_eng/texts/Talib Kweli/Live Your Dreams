[Intro]
Your struggles are hard, but don't break the ground
If you're standing be strong
I will hold you down
Wooah, wooooa
Don't you break the ground
Wooah, wooooa
Don't you break the ground
Wooah, wooooa

[Hook]
If you come up short don't stop your stride
Don't be a fool and let this pass you by
Waaaooh
Live for your dreams
Waaaooh
Live for your dreams
Live for your dreams
Live for your dreams

[Verse 1 - Bryant Dope]
Everyone wants to be a millionaire
But no one wants to work, hey
How you gonna stay dead asleep and expect to live out your dreams
Dreams mean more when the work's hard fought
To touch the ceiling you gotta start at the floor
You gotta stay awake like a caffeine fiend
You gotta feel loss if you really wanna win
You gotta move like clocks non-stop
With every tick, getting closer to the top
Success ain't quick, you gotta wait in line
Don't dial at the sun, asking where's your shine
You gotta play cool, you can't rush time
And you gotta grind like you one your last dime
Laugh at haters, they just wanna take your spot
It's gonna feel good when your standing at the top

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Talib Kweli]
Rolling through the back streets like I got beef
A carnival for carnivores with the sharp teeth
They animalistic, that's why we call the cops beasts
They on the hunt, plus they hungry for the dark meat
I rap 'til my heart beat
The brain is the base
The heart is the drum
Give the drummer some
When trouble come, you gonna run
Well, it's not livin'
When I stopped smoking weed my dreams got vivid
Master of my destiny, but I ain't selling slaves
Just tryna live through my dreams like Ellen Page
Inception, my dreams are my life's reflection
I fight rhyme, every line is a weapon, I'm shooting
The things you want could be sweeter than Willy Wonka
But first you gotta decide which side you really on
Don't listen to the haters
The haters'll steer you wrong
Lose faith in the dream like Cristina Milian

[Hook]

[Outro]
Who said it was gonna be easy
If it was we'd all be billionaires
We got some up and got your downs

[Hook]
