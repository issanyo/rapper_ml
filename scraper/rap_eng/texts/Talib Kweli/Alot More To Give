[Hook: Talib Kweli] x2
I got it all man
I get it all man
I get it how I live man
I got alot more to give man

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Walking with humility dappin' the people feelin' me
Your man is [?] in the Philippines
Living amongst the fullest east neighbours are known to kill your dreams
The death toll will make your head roll like a guillotine
Survivor of the industry, with or without the radio
People not buying that, how could you really blame 'em though?
You pussy ass and kitten just bullshittin for fame
So I'm disrespectin' the lames that's disrespectin' the game
I get in a separate lane, swervin and never follow
You chasing up the models my motto a business model yep
You wanna be successful then switch up your definition
From getting richer to simply doin' whatcha love for a livin'
We filling up the prison til all conditions is critical
Rehabilitated? Nope, now we just better criminals
Unless you get a shiv in you
Blood all in the ghetto, your mother forever missin' you
Cuz of what you cover, yep

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Cory Mo]
Get it how you live or get caught in the cross pimpin'
Never caught slippin' my business ain't your business
The difference between losing and winning is detrimental
I was taught to be a winner don't settle for second fiddle
My mission is to make it to the top of this game
Through all the politics as usual mane, I'm not new to this thang
I use it to maneuver through the nonsense
Currency over bitches forever on my conscience
Never think about the critics or criticism
I focus on blendin' my lyricism with the rhythm
I be givin them the gift of gab since I was a child
Patiently waitin' and plottin' on them all the while
Do me a favour, never do me no fuckin favours
No love for the labels I want this independent paper
I got alot to give and got alot more to prove
My back is up against the wall I ain't got nuthin to lose foo
