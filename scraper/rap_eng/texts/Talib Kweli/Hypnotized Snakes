[Intro:]
Calling to the coach
Let me know where it is talk to them

[Verse 1:]
Ready on three
Please pour me perry
Skeptics in the residence like uh
What the hell he ya
Im on that new wave. hell yea
Its like the water from the waterboard
Now comparing to heavy on the puberty is not comparable
The taste of it is terrible
I sip the nectar of the Gods
And now i'm writing records with the gods
Anti-social but the pocket full of dead friends
And the peanut butter goes inside of the red benz
And my purata momma causing accidents
Earthquakes, meteor strikes volcanoes, eruptions and air spins
As a mastermind in my DNA
I don't got no time for no VMA
Mix the Y with the EMG and it's time for some TNA
Cause i grind til i see the day i expire
Blaze fire
No days off just just asking yulo
Great rides drink live in a glass full of
Rap cooler, and i jab like zab trooger
Be down for the count like Dracula
Im a fool for the cash mad mula
I can't put my finger on it, that's lula
Pull up with that foreign , a black bulla
Oh lord kakala Hallelujah
Gt a gold digging bitch who wanting diamonds and purses
Got my head in the clouds she got her hand in my pocket
I gave her an habitual criminal stare
She text me, not proceeding down invisible stairs
The rap game is full with pitiful imbeciles who dare
Remember was it fictional fear?
So i trip before i kick in the stairs
Spittin medical peers
Smoking medicinal like i'm living in the biblical years
Jesus!

[Music]
We Out here you, shit i Hope you live a hundred years

[Verse 2:]
I been a boystar call me
Stop at the indian spa order a bag of good shit
Shout out to Roger he just street talking shit
Number 23 dropping that swoosh
Cowards wanna get loud with me
Anytime brother
That shit not gonna fly with me
Do not civilize or criticize or hate
But i got grass i rather emphasize the great
Enterprise is grey, dim the lights grey
Play the indian flute i can hypnotize a snake
You a bastard can't say we serve ya
I gravitate universal

[Indian Music]
