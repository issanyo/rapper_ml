[Intro]
The corner, the corner
Where you learn to earn
Where you get determined
There's a place in your mind where your darkest thoughts reside
It's what I shout anytime I get on an elevator
(The corner, the corner)
Only some of y'all know about that

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Man they work us like dogs
Our tongues wag at the corpses
Corner the market like corporate all from a corner office
Smog out our lungs, black as the smoke
Just try to pass up the soap
Get hit in the back of the dome with the four fifth
Put Olympics where niggas is passing the torches
To every hand in the ghetto
We Hansel and Gretel we trapped in the forest
We went from captives on boat trips
To the corners with the rats and the roaches
Now we grind with spectacular foes and jokers
In the corner of the club making the models nervous
Any nigga try to front send them some bottle service
We follow verdicts like Buddhists to follow Sherpas
Respect what they say
Yesterday's fights, tomorrow's murders
I hope and I pray that you never forget where you came from
Close to the slaves except this light post that we hang from
Nightmares of getting [shot at?] and woke with the same gun

[Hook]
That was just a dream
That’s me on the corner
That’s me in the spotlight
Fucking cop don’t say I ain’t warn you
Trying to keep up with me
And I don’t know if you can do it
Oh no I’ve said too much (that was just a dream)
I haven’t said enough (that was just a dream)
(That's me in the corner)

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Woke up this morning like fuck all of my opponents
Grabbed my strap, jumped in that hooptie
Hit the block and hit some donuts
I’m hanging out the window middle finger to the police
Shining diamonds got them blinded by reflections of this rollie
I was broke as shit, they didn’t know me then
Niggas hands out, always on that owe me shit
Sometimes I get paranoid like when I was holding bricks
Everyone’s a suspect - be careful who you rolling with
For that blow, guns blow like trumpets
Home invasions get your ticket-free lunches
Reminiscing off Rémy yea that’s the remedy
Roof over my head, you seen how they did Kennedy
Life is a traffic jam, trying to get by
Kweli, light up the fire
Time to get high, know why?
Because...

[Outro]
That was just a dream
That was just a dream
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep a view
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
You try, you cry, you fly, you try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dream
