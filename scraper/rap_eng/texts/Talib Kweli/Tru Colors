[Intro]
(Colors of you)

[Verse 1]
How you expect to have an ordinary relationship
With such an extraordinary nigga
Yea there's flaws in what you figured
Ain't the liquor that got you considering calling up the sitter
Telling her you need a couple hours and of course you tip her
I like my fantasies, half stripper half glass slipper
Wrappin' one like a riddle with enigma
Character in my flip book
Coming to life when I'm flipping through the pictures
Switching up the positions
My karma karma chameleon
Change colors with the surroundings
I can hear you with my eyes and I'm loving the way you sound
And I'm smothering and I'm grindin'
Now doubt is counting me out
Loving in public when we coming and
Up against the cupboard til we...
(Look like turquoise)
Right on the couch
(Yellow on the bad day)
Knocking it out without a doubt

[Chorus]
I used to think about how you would act when a nigga got money
Now you done switched up on me
Now you wanna say "What's up?" to me
Okay, so now you wanna make love to me
Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me
Just be honest, girl, what you want from me?
This ain't nothin' new, keep it so 100
I can't let none of these niggas get one up on me
I go by God-Tiller, you better run from me
Give hope to my niggas, them niggas love money
Adios to them bitches, can't get a hug from me
I'm high on life, that's what it does for me
My numbers goin' up, I feel a buzz comin' (one up)
Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you ('cause I'm on nigga)
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers

[Verse 2]
When you see it from this angle the colour, the cut the clarity
Starts bringing me down that's the depravity of gravity
Having me in my blue phase
Go off the grid for a few days
Go on a journey without a suitcase
The security of obscurity in a world of respect
And I'm trading it like a currency
Currently you soft as a mallet hitting a xylophone
He so yella I'm wishin' his fella right his wrong
But naw, instead he is synthetic as styrofoam
Recite a poem so monotone that they monochrome
My light'll poke through the clouds
We'll take you higher like you smoking the loud
While I provide the dope kaleidoscope of sound

[Chorus]
I used to think about how you would act when a nigga got money
Now you done switched up on me
Now you wanna say "What's up?" to me
Okay, so now you wanna make love to me
Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me
Just be honest, girl, what you want from me?
This ain't nothin' new, keep it so 100
I can't let none of these niggas get one up on me
I go by God-Tiller, you better run from me
Give hope to my niggas, them niggas love money
Adios to them bitches, can't get a hug from me
I'm high on life, that's what it does for me
My numbers goin' up, I feel a buzz comin' (one up)
Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you ('cause I'm on nigga)
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers
