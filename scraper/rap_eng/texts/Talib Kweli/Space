[Verse]
What we gon' do?
We gon' work, we gon' play, we gon' lead the way
We gon' say everything that we need to say
Then get ghost in the breeze to blow the leaves away
And seize the day, it's like we're throwin' our seeds away
That ain't for me to say, right? It ain't got to be this way
We gon' take charge, make gods out of men
We gon' raise bars, show y'all how to win
Hit the rally, hit the riot, get the party started
Respect the word, you herbs, it's the Kwelity artist
Who solemnly promise my knowledge will demolish your college
And minus your scholarship acknowledge the dollars
And want me to payola, man I don't even know that broad
I'm takin' over, keep it fresh like bakin' soda
In your fridge, I keep it Brooklyn like Jamaican soda, escovitch
That's how it is, and everything is everything
Time to move on to better things
Kwelity, in the club is probably where Kweli be
Steadily ignoring all the policies
No ID, rockin' shorts and tees
VIP, puffin' all sorts of trees
You must mistake me for one of them soft emcees
I ain't like the rest you often see, get off of me, yo

[Outro]
Everybody, gimme my space
Everybody take four steps back
Somebody gon' get hurt
All fun and games 'til someone lose an eye or something
I ain't playin' with y'all
Everybody in the house, back up, back up and gimme my space
There's enough room in here for everyone to eat
Everyone to breathe, everyone to live
We can all get it if we get it together
Know what I mean, yo?
Come on, gimme my space
Just rock to this
Just rock to that
Everybody in the house, back up, back up and gimme my space
Come on, just rock to this...
