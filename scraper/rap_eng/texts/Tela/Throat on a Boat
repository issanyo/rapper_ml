Motherfucker you cold!
I know, y'all nigga's can't coat
When a nigga gettin' Throat On a Boat
Motherfucker you cold!
I know, y'all nigga's can't coat
When a nigga gettin' Throat at a Show
Motherfucker you cold!
I know, some niggas better hope
That some nigga ain't throatin' yo hoe
Motherfucker you wrong!
I know, some niggas can't believe that they hoe, can swallow and leave
But she back stage, black braids, black shades
The fact lays, I'ma nigga out the Black Haze
She like suckin, she say she right or somethin'
I'm thinkin' bout half the night, she bitin' somethin'
She say she don't like to umm suck dick
Say it make her sick, but I can hit that ass if it's quick
Is that yo pussy odor like a shit load
Say I need some Ivory Spring in me hoe
I don't think so, fuck no
I don't give a fuck, how hard these drinks go
Pimpin' , lead fuel, do-do, it smell like some shit then died up in you
I'm advisin' you, and it's suprisin' to
See these bitches in school, and the guys is cool
Guess go to show, them covers ain't so
You gotta throw 'em through the books these days and rip out the page
