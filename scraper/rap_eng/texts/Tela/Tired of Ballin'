Yo Bitches
Too much all of that got damn shit player, Just Ballin

Chorus:
I'm so tired of ballin, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
You never hear a baller say that shit
I'm so tired of ballinnn, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
You never hear me say that shit
I'm so tired of ballinnn, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
You never hear a baller say that shit
I'm so tired of ballinnn, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
Raise up off me trick

Who motivates the bitches suck a dick, shit me
Mopad they ass to the crib like a Spree
It started back with me and T. Draper
Fuck a caper
Cause we already got paper gator
Big blocks, Versace and all that shit
B and Fly we's a motherfucking sons a bitch
You compete if you wanna
Ask Nuwana
That's my momma
She tell ya there is no number
To compare with a nigga in my state of mind
Cause I'll twist ya ass up, push stop and rewind
No retiring from productive ass baller shit
That be the day they put my ass in a log and shit
See I can call this shit
Milleniums ahead of time
I'm going to fuck your bitch without really even crying
It's getting crucial
I got more loot than used to
Hoes be trying to sue you
And niggas on my block be trying to shoot you
And when the nigga bust go and get that thang
Motivated baller handle that shit main
Know what I'm saying
Look at the shit rain
Not the shit
Know what I'm saying
Bring the pain
If you got to nigga ball

Chorus
I'm so tired of ballin, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
You never hear a baller say that shit
I'm so tired of ballinnn, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
We smoking so much dope in ninety fucking six
I'm so tired of ballinnn, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
You never hear a baller say that shit
I'm so tired of ballinnn, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
Raise up off me trick

Who keeps the hoes squeaky like the ones in Black Tail
Smoke a Black and Mild, fuck a ho to lax hell
Ain't shit a bitch can tell me, ain't shit to be tell
And if my ass go to jail
Fuck it, I'll make bail
Who accomodates the street in the late night cruise
Keep em' all on they feet in deep colors of blues
Lambskins on the seats for the heat in June
Baggets and Moets got me spoiled too soon
Fuck I'm splurgging and I'm burbing
I'm hitting urban
I hit the curb and
I'm fucking hoes by the fucking herdsin
Cattle
Spank more ass like a paddle
Shit I love it when you got my nuts on your chin hear em' rattle
Skit Skadittle
Got the shit'll
Get your ass in the chest
Get em' out your valve pro little
Naps
Soldier boy like taps
Tela gets two snaps
Pick ya'll ass out like some gnats
Yaps!

Chorus:
I'm so tired of ballin, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
You never hear a baller say that shit
I'm so tired of ballinnn, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
You never hear a baller say that shit
I'm so tired of ballinnn, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
You never hear a Suave nigga say that shit
I'm so tired of ballinnn, cause it's too many bitches on my dick
Raise up off me trick

Now whose the motherfucker representing Blackhave
Suave to the grave
And we all getting paid
Catch the hotel and ain't a ho to be saved
And if your ass feel that way
Then you probably bitch made
Engine raised
And warnings to avoid our seriousness
Maximum protection pimp a ho till she's delirious
I'm curious
Like George
That's why I'm employed
By the label that made your ass lay it down on floors
Draper boys rolling deep
Necessary explanantions obsolete
Cause we don't bullshit come and peep game
I reframe in the membrane
Of a bitch to make suck her suck a dick and don't feel ashame
Now whose the main
Suicidal like Kurt Cobain
Send ya'lls asses up like the souls of fucking train
Many motherfuckers they be talking about Dane
On the dick, of Suave knights but that shit going to change
You can highlight that shit with a motherfucking pen main
You know what I'm saying
Cause we going to keep ballin
All through this bitch
Through 96'
So fuck all ya'll
Ride the fucking dick
