[Intro]
*light rain and thunder in the background*
Man I'm tryin' to tell you, coming down that bellview
Leaned up, screened up
In search of the mean truth
Yeah I got this pimp ish in me and I got this memphis in me
Plus the fact that i'm cursed by remy and I couldn't help that my father gave me'
Good with my talking game, make some bitches stalk a man
Don't speak on the gangsta man, won't sleep if I chopped a man
Nah i gots to clear a nigga, I ain't talking kill these niggas
But you got to feels me nigga give a brick that bill a nigga
Gots to mention critics who don't listen but they pick and pigeon
Saying that I don't apply myself and I can't go distance
Trying to go as far but my mind don't jar
Hoping my time don't stop
Hoping you niggas don't drop on my radar, but you will
Sometimes I think that you will ruin my career, The devil you is a lie
You ain't gonna win up in here, If you's a man
Hold your hands up cause I'm reaching you clear
Today I fully understand, I'm shedding so many tears
The children of this rap shit and I swear you molesters
No hits abandon ship,hangers drying on dressers
Yo they say we superstars when we falling who catch us?
Can't you say God gave us callings and this music is a blessing
God surround me with 27 angels of protection
Grant me the realness, stay real project in any direction
As I strategize my moves watching my queen and they bishop
I don't trust them nor they puns like I was wronged by they bishop
Yeah pat me down young nigga
You gone find this pistol
I don't do it just for the bread
I love it, it's official
Yeah nigga
Double dose nigga
Double dose
*outro drums and instruments fade*
