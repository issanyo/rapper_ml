*(Yuk)*

Uh, uh, ah. Uh-huh
What? Where my ladies at?
Uh. Where my ladies at?
Let's do this.....uh, Menage A Trios style
It's the 90's, and regular sex is played out
I need two women, at one time!
One time!

Verse 1 *(Yukmouth)*

What?
Uh
Let's take it back, to the day we first met
I see you and your girls buyin purses
Lookin like two Miss Universe's
Make a nigga wanna curse "Shit!"
Who them two bitches, let me go spit a couple of verses, see if I can
Work it
I dropped some money on purpose
You picked it up, an said "I dropped some"
Stop frontin you can tell from my watch that I got somethin
An that I squat somethin nice, pop somethin nice
Up in the air so elegant
You can tell I pimp but that's irrelavent
An I can tell by the way you and yo girl hang tight
That y'all be doin y'all thug thang at night
Somethin like dikes
Ain't nothin like.... two girls makin love to each other
Ain't nothin like.... two girls bustin nuts up on each other
Ain't nothin like.... two girls at the club, rubbin on each other
Ain't nothin like.... two girls kissin and huggin on each other
Ain't nothin like.... two girls juss suckin on you like a sucka
Ain't nothin like.... cuz we fuckin each other, in a Menage A Trios

Chorus *(Kira)* 2x

Can we get freaky tonight?
I want you and your girl to come by
I like to do Menage A Trios
I like it when you do me, do me

Verse 2 *(Tela)*

Me and you Menage A Trios
Bring along another star
Drinky drinky at the bar
We can freak it in the car
You know how we do it ah
You got to influence her
Let her know which two of us
Me and you, and her and Yuk
You want me to set it up
Get that pussy wet it up
Bitch you betta shut it up
There won't be no lettin up
You know what's ahead of us
Video tape, no editors
I be the executive
Producer while y'all sex it up
Kissin up, put the pissin up
Pussy like that gotta switch it up
I know what's like dickin up
Dildos
Ticklers
Pickin lips, rediculous
Gotta get a lil mo' sick wit us
Bout this time I'm bout to bust
Spend up shit like steaky luck
Damn you know this cock is hot
But you know what's really hot
Bitch you fuckin Rap-A-Lot
And this shit will never stop
For all my dawgs, I'm gettin y'all in here
Menage A Trios, and enjoy yourself, come on, uh!

*(Chorus)* 2x

Spend the night wit me
I'll spend the night with you
Ooohh ooohh
Ooohh ooohh
(Spend the night!)
Spend the night wit me
Don't care what we do
Juss as long as I'm with you

Verse 3 *(Yukmouth)*

Now we can kick it in my 4 point 6
Bangin "It's All On A Bitch"
You lickin my dick, wit yo ass up in the air she lickin yo clit
Now that's the shit
You wonder why they call me Hugh Heff
Cuz I keep two chicks
Runnin around butt naked in my duplex
Screamin who's next
Yup in this life that I'm livin
I can't escape I'm in love wit two women
Swimmin in two women at once
Or I can relax, juss hittin on blunts
While y'all lickin on cunts, get shit crunk
I visioned it once, then tweedle-dum I'm in a threesome
Wit me some bad chicks, hungry fo dick so I'ma feed 'em
We some fools off the cool
Gone off Xtacy and mushrooms in the room
I can do it slow, or I can room-a-zoom-zoom... BOOM!
Into that pussy like a bullet wound
Put on my Fruit of the Looms
And then I creep out the room
(ooooh!!)
Cuz if you baby daddy find out what we doin you doomed
I'm out, so I'm out!

*(Chorus)* 2x

Spend the night wit me
I'll spend the night with you
Ooohh ooohh
Ooohh ooohh
(Spend the night!)
Spend the night wit me
Don't care what we do
Juss as long as I'm with you

*(freak talking)*

Look check it out Yuk
I ain't a freak or nothin, but umm... I like to do this Menage A Trios
Thing
You know? (Girl I like it too, shit)
You know, doin it wit you is cool, but umm... wit yo girl it juss makes
Things twice as good, she's better
Umm-hmm
(Hell yeah!)
