Verse 1:
Carrbian I, classy down, headed for a while, beat this bitch by a mile
Cowboy bow push powder through the nile
New legs have green gator crocastyle
Still gator, don't hate us, just play us, fade us
But you can't, can't weigh us, scally as fish
We brush lebrush ain't no tellin with this
Keep a bitch with a six, get shit with my neighbors
Colorado flavor, five mile ski in, ski out location
My life on the lots, wild life tears and hearts
Playin golf how much it's gon cost
Bought half of your ark
Mad at what you thought, cause you ain't a big boy
Shit you just got caught, pissed off for da soft
Quit shake it off, I don't know, try back in a year, cause you soft

Chorus:
Gonna make your millions, I'll be your wife and have your children
Stack money to the ceiling, nothin but good livin
Got a house on the lake, waterfalls on our estate
Behind electric gates, just me and you baby

Verse 2:
Back yard full of lumas', bemas', hummas'
Birds from bahammas' we runnin numbers
I promise, none of ya'll can take it all from us
Promise gonna be platnum this summer
Straight shit like a anus, everybody wanna be rich and famous
But they ain't able to claim it, you name it we got it
Shakeo' cain'ts and Wako's erotic, overseas cottage
Put the crome on Mercadese, A.T.L. ladies
Put the phone on the roll it's on, let's rome baby
Hugo, Bruno, I go, You go, in the range rov
Excitin black leather with the white piping
So much oak stike a match and you'll chock
Fifty folks at a house, off of the coast
You can show them yo coats, and luxurious boats, you know

Chorus:
Gonna make your millions, I'll be your wife and have your children
Stack money to the ceiling, nothin but good livin
Got a house on the lake, waterfalls on our estate
Behind electric gates, just me and you baby

Verse 3:
Big boy livin, hurt feelins', indoor scrimmin' for the kids and the women
Drape limmins' with shanel prints in them
If you wanna be em' vix go get em
Thats right, I know what wife he like
But it's a price to pay if you want this life
Nice ice with the apple bent g twice
Wanna give you everything that you want that you like
I don't care livin', I don't care spendin', If you need it for a day
I don't care rent it, lick court tennits
Takin trips to Venis, do it just for fun just to say that we did it
Wit begginit, six for a minutes, somebody hit it
Leave it cause it's finished, recommend us to the nearest A.M
Delas' commin on the primas' yellin sweet business

Chorus:(x7)
Gonna make your millions, I'll be your wife and have your children
Stack money to the ceiling, nothin but good livin
Got a house on the lake, waterfalls on our estate
Behind electric gates, just me and you baby
