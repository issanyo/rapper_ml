Any motherfucker talking bout thangs
This is Suave House, shit's gonna change
Any motherfucker talking bout thangs
This is Suave House, shit's gonna change
Any motherfucker talking bout thangs
This is Suave House, shit's gonna change
Any motherfucker talking bout thangs
This is Suave House, shit's gonna change

I grab the chrome from the shelf
Cause it ain't nothing like left
Your last step or should I say your last breath
G is past death
Do us part when you fucking with that Suave - House
Here, click whenever you on that corner
Bitches born from the south, tremendous doubt
But I ain't tripping, how I'm living
I get to dipping
From 96' to 2000 back to the thresh holds of Olympus
No limits, heaven forgive us, we was born solely sinners
Continuous, extraneous with this, cold as quitters
Oldest niggas, still they be like acting like such
So I ain't giving a fuck, with chances to clear the shit up
For what, I seek steel, I get stuck
I play jacks on the year like Bill Rodell, get hit by a truck
Bent the fuck back, despite the worst day handle my shit
Son be scared to make that cheese, see I ain't afraid, I ain't like that
So hit code red, that's what I said, straight ahead
Let's get it on, break some bread, toast some wine oh yeah

[Hook]
Rider, I just want to ride
Pass me a lighter, pass it to me, won't you pass it to me
Rider, I just want, I just want to ride
Pass me a lighter, pass it to me

Let's party like for the soldier in the paint
Who's down to pimp a bitch whatever it be to make your bank
Shirt is off shorty, let's drank, crank, get crunk
Ain't no tanks in my trunk with some pumps
Just some chrome and such
And you can break the seal
On top of the wood on the bottom, that's the one's that are real
I can feel attention
It's all around me when I'm flipping at home in Memphis
Mentality, doberman pinscher
Not to mention that my ride stays out of state
And that my mind state is out of state
So they try to hypocrate
Setting voodoo, like in the movies
Giving me hell, call me Denzel
Chasing pipe bombs through A-T-L
But I prevail, cause I'm the best one, unconditional
With a high tech vest, maintain these little unknown body bags
Blast through sheet metal, and disappear
Come back, as a street weapon wearing some Suave gear, niggas unprepared

I sets it off, in the center of the spot
It's getting hot, even in the winter I make it thicker than sheet rock
The plot I'm plotting, has got you open, hoping, scoping
That you can keep up with the flow that is spoken
No choking, I'm soaking, like collard greens, it seem
All this game of, where I came from, done seen many things
Bring killer niggas around me, shotguns in the county
Bounty hunters with runners, 5-0 bet em' they can't find me
Wanna blind me and my diesels, with my peoples behind me
Grind and grit to the bone, I'm stacking paper till I'm gone
Phone, house I'm getting, while I'm on the pot shitting
Trying to figure out a way to get better on Thanksgiving
Plymouth and powder rocks get dropped
So it don't take but a second for me to fuck your whole block
Stop, but I can't see I'ma ride till I die
Nigga S-U-A-V-E tatooed down my spine

[Hook, repeated to fade]
