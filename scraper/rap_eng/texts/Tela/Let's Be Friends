Uhh, haha yeah, shit bangs, bang out the frame
My man Wayne, this shit right heah, this is somethin
I put it straight to ya so everybody can fuck with it
Niggas, bitches, y'know, everybody
Little kids, everybody can relate to this, yeah

Now you been down with this hoe since the seventh and eighth
High school, night school, shit y'all was runnin mates
Same hustle, clocked your girl in when she was late
Side by side, boxed hoes when they called her fake
And that's your boo, that's your dawg, sister to the end
And when her folks kicked her out, shit you moved her straight in
Y'all used to hang so tight niggas mistake you for twins
Names just alike, Carol and Carolyn
She would lie to you, steal from you, say she didn't take it
You knew she wasn't right but that's your girl you let her make it
Now who pulled her through when she needed her a portion
But who left yo' ass in the center of the ocean?
She fucked her cousin nigga and she fucked her nigga family
You never ever thought that she would fuck yo' baby daddy
Everybody tried to tell you but yo' ass wouldn't listen
And now this hoe done came up missin
But that's your motherfuckin friend

[Chorus]
Friends (my nigga), how many of us have them?
Fri-enn-ends (yup), before we go any further
Let's be friends .. (my motherfucker)
How many of us have them?
Fri-enn-ends (y'all), the ones we can depend on
Let's be friends

[Tela]
This ya boy, this ya nigga, motherfuckin close dawg
And it ain't too many niggas you can pass the ball
He never fumble, stay humble since you stumbled on him
Save you from drownin that summer when you thought you could swim
Used to run choo-choo trains on his homegirl Kim
For you, your man'd put his ass on the limb
Now he was slicker with them hoes and youse a funny-lookin nigga
Could only get that pussy when the money lookin nigga
He always got it first and you was second base
I guess this about the time we can establish the hate
Got his ass on quicker, started movin weight
Shit he showed you too much, that was the first mistake
With friends like you, tell me who needs problems?
Wanna set your man up, not to kill him, just rob him
But somewhere in yo' flag everything went bad
Mag hit him in the head, that's it, he's dead, he left your friend

[Chorus]
Friends (yup), how many of us have them?
Fri-enn-ends (you my muh'fucker), before we go any further
Let's be friends .. (my dawg)
How many of us have them?
Fri-enn-ends (my nig-ga), the ones we can depend on
Let's be friends

[Tela]
Now you been sleepin with this muh'fucker every night
Pillow talk, shared your thoughts, shit just split your life
As they grew up in age they got stubborn and trife
Everybody else was wrong and they was always right
So quick to point the finger, instigatin the fight
I don't care if it was lovely they find somethin they don't like
Oh so dumb smart don't need no advice
Folks so dumb smart too bright to get the lights
You know the kind, don't hear, don't see it in the mirror
They dress it up with bullshit to make it appear clearer
With he say, she say, that's all they know
What did they do, where did they go, that's all they livin fo'
They wake up one mornin, they done missed the show
Countin up birthdays like where the fuck did time go?
Now look at the situation that you got yourself in
Sit self down and ask self, "Self, is you my motherfuckin friend?"

[Chorus]
Friends (yup), how many of us have them?
Fri-enn-ends (cause you my muh'fucker), before we go any further
Let's be friends .. (my nig-ga)
How many of us have them?
Fri-enn-ends (my dawg), the ones we can depend on
Let's be friends (muh'fucker), how many of us have them?
Fri-enn-ends, before we go any further
Let's be friends .. (yup)
How many of us have them?
Fri-enn-ends (you my muh'fucker, my dawg, my nigga, my muh'fucker)
The ones we can depend on, let's be friends..
(My nigga)
