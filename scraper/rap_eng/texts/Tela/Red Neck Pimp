Shit how bout all you got damn rootin tootin rap shootin son of a bitches
I'm out here to tell you my name is Fancy Cow Lee
And got dammit I don't like rap
But I like that got damn Teller
That got damn Teller know he got himself together
That damn sho nuff
Reason why I like him
Cause shit I can pretty much relate to him
Shit I pimp hoes
All around the got damn county
Shit I go around here to ah Truckers street
And get my money from Samanther and and and and old Tree Selmer
I go on down the block two and three down the road
And get the rest of my money from old ah Peggy Sue and Murle
And I come on back round before I hit the old farm
And collect the rest of my cheeze from old Desaco over there
And shit bout time I get through with all my freakin rounds
I got just about a hundred and twenty-two and thirteen cent
Just enough to get me some treapin tards for Peggy
If yall don't know everything about pimpin
Yall need to be tryin to holler at Teller
Got damn Teller
He got his self together
