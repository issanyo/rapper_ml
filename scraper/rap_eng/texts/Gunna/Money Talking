[Chorus: Gunna]
Hear that money talking
I'm in designer walking
I put that money all in
Stack the money by the 10
40 thousand for the lens
From a bucket to a Benz
Nigga know I came to win
I hear that money talking
Hear that money calling
I'm in the mall, I'm balling
I gotta keep the carbon
I ain't tryna bargain
I cop the drop-top six
I'm in the top cockpit

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Spit this shit up out the door
Niggas know I keep the tone
I can do it all alone
Had to do it for my home
Niggas 'till I'm moving on
Got some money on the phone
Got them shows on my own
57 for the shows
Putting rappers on they toes
Cause they know I ain't tote
I can never break the code
I will never ever fold
This some shit I woulda hoped
And then pulled up in a Rolls
Everybody used to kick doors
'Till I pulled up on [?] road, and seen a spot full of yams
I sold my first car and got a half a bag and started breaking down grams
Now I'm texting Uncle Sam
But the fucker started scamming
Now I'm hopping on a gram
Me and Nechie in a Lamb'
Had to show 'em who I am
Had to show 'em who I was
Had to show 'em what I want
Rock star with a bunch
Niggas do it for the front
'Cept you should do it for the ones
Tryna hit like Barry Bonds
Make a million every month

[Chorus: Gunna]
Hear that money talking
I'm in designer walking
I put that money all in
Stack the money by the 10
40 thousand for the lens
From a bucket to a Benz
Nigga know I came to win
I hear that money talking
Hear that money calling
I'm in the mall, I'm balling
I gotta keep the carbon
I ain't tryna bargain
I cop the drop-top six
I'm in the top cockpit

[Verse 2: Nechie]
Every time you see I poke my chest out
And my life been looking good but I been stressed out
For them niggas who talking big, you know they chests out
Why the fuck you buy a vest, you want yo head clocked
And when that money talk we cappin' out, what we live now
Killing everything but the kids now, that how it is now
I used to be broke, I walk around with a 10 now
Ready to just spend on anything that I feel now
Through these chrome heart lenses I see it all yeah
I see the hate, I see the fake, I see the flawed yeah
Fuck it we gon' ball yeah
Stevie Wonder, see we getting cake, we getting it all yeah
And we ain't playing with these hoes, cause we don't hear them all yeah
Never fall, I stand tall on it
Shit I just hit the light and cashed out on
I bought a Mulsanne, and a new chain, you niggas too lame
Kicking flavor like I'm Liu Kang from the south but I ain't 2 Chainz

[Chorus: Gunna]
Hear that money talking
I'm in designer walking
I put that money all in
Stack the money by the 10
40 thousand for the lens
From a bucket to a Benz
Nigga know I came to win
I hear that money talking
Hear that money calling
I'm in the mall, I'm balling
I gotta keep the carbon
I ain't tryna bargain
I cop the drop-top six
I'm in the top cockpit
