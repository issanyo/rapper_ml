[Chorus]
Young nigga colorblind, blue hunnids all I see
And them bust down, got some diamonds and some molly on me
And I let her ride, she a dime, and plus I gotta dime on me
She a wild lil' beast and I'ma let her ride on me
Foreign outside, wide body ain't got no key
And we touring out of town, bitch say she never see me
Told bro we ain't take this route we was never gon' eat
Glad I made it out the jungle I'ma feast with the belly of the beast

[Verse 1]
Yeah, told you I'ma show you who I am
Touchdown, came home from jail
Still had dope on the scale
These niggas thought I would fail
Went and got a Rollie, Audemars (Audemars)
Keep the finer K like the fair
Sitting on some bands like a chair
And I was tryna whip some fish scale
You see me coulda sent it through the mail
Walked in the spot, had a smell
Shit was all white, looked pale
And I got the last bale off
I was tryna shoot but I was shell
And they say the lean help my health
Smoke the shit leave it in the air
And we'll never leave, we'll never fail
'Cause we the last real niggas left
All my young niggas real
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pull up at the spot we Dare
We ain't never ever care
We gon' cop designer every pair
I cherish this shit and we share

[Chorus]
Young nigga colorblind, blue hunnids all I see
And them bust down, got some diamonds and some molly on me
And I let her ride, she a dime, and plus I gotta dime on me
She a wild lil' beast and I'ma let her ride on me
Foreign outside, wide body ain't got no key
And we touring out of town, bitch say she never see me
Told bro we ain't take this route we was never gon' eat
Glad I made it out the jungle I'ma feast with the belly of the beast

[Verse 2]
Ayy, too many chains like a slave
Told my bitches behave
I'ma take this shit to the grave
You stand in line for the J's
I was tryna cop some new Ye
They told me Gunna Gunna you the wave
Now I'm tryna go and catch a play
And I hadda good day
Told my bitch she slay
Barber never gave me no fade
But a nigga down to catch a fade
Treat him like a meal, he a plate
I ride around with them snakes
And all my niggas gon' shake
All my niggas livin' off fate
I'm just staying down for the come up
And I'm going hard give it all what it take
Told you was no time to debate
Don't put me on the time I ain't late
Told you I'ma grind for the A
Used to get them pounds from the bay
Niggas better stay down and lay
On the fucking ground in your face

[Chorus]
Young nigga colorblind, blue hunnids all I see
And them bust down, got some diamonds and some molly on me
And I let her ride, she a dime, and plus I gotta dime on me
She a wild lil' beast and I'ma let her ride on me
Foreign outside, wide body ain't got no key
And we touring out of town, bitch say she never see me
Told bro we ain't take this route we was never gon' eat
Glad I made it out the jungle I'ma feast with the belly of the beast
