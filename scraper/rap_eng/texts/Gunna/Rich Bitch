[Chorus]
I need a rich bitch
I bought a red ‘vette
She give me that head, sex
These's VVS, yes
I popped a X, yes
Still ain't no yes-man (nah)
And that's yo best bet (best bet)
Put my crew on a big jet
I got gold like a treasure chest
I can't hold up my pants & bands
Only here for these Benjamins
These fuck niggas didn't lend a hand
Do this shit for my fam and fans
Saving all of these presidents (yeah)

[Verse 1]
I just told Richie; we rich
I got Metro in this bitch
I see Lil Durk in this bitch
Pop me a perc, take a sip
I'm glad that we made it, we here
TM88 with the drip
We make them blue faces appear
Had to kill ‘em, my bad my nigga
I'm just gettin' in my bag my nigga
Calculating and adding these figures (mmm)
My lil' bitch bad and attentive
I told PR to pass the skittles
I just popped me a half, my nigga (mmm)
That's my partner, my slime, my nigga
I locked in with my kind my nigga
I ain't have to go out, I hit her
They gone pull up and ride
Yo bitch keep on eyeing a nigga
I can't stop her from liking these pictures
I hope all of my bitches get richer

[Chorus]
I need a rich bitch
I bought a red ‘vette
She give me that head, sex
These's VVS, yes
I popped a X, yes
Still ain't no yes-man (nah)
And that's yo best bet (best bet)
Put my crew on a big jet
I got gold like a treasure chest
I can't hold up my pants & bands
Only here for these Benjamins
These fuck niggas didn't lend a hand
Do this shit for my fam and friends
Saving all of these presidents (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Ima valet to Fifth's
I want the latest drip
I got a Draco in here
Lil nigga, don't play
Ima let Dre fuck yo bitch
I run with Lil Bouf in the 6
We gone do this for Troup til the end (ay)
You gone spray it? Then spray my nigga
We gone pull up with Ks, extensions
You gone work and get paid my nigga
I just witness, you payed attention
Had to go make my own decision
I didn't do this for no attention
I just wanted to see more of these benjis
(Mm)
I was down to my last and spent it
Now it's small shopping bags and Fendi
Take it off for a glass of henny
Fuck your ho, give her back
YSL can't stop bagging these bitches
Like we switched from the gas to the midget
Gunna havin' these hoes like Hendrix

[Chorus]
I need a rich bitch
I bought a red ‘vette
She give me that head, sex
These's VVS, yes
I popped a X, yes
Still ain't no yes-man (nah)
And that's yo best bet (best bet)
Put my crew on a big jet
I got gold like a treasure chest
I can't hold up my pants & bands
Only here for these Benjamins
These fuck niggas didn't lend a hand
Do this shit for my fam and friends
Saving all of these presidents (yeah)
