[Intro: Smokepurpp & Gunna]
Lil Purpp bless yo trap
Yeah I'm gonna bless yo drip
Bitch
Yeah

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Amiri jeans hold the tech, that's how I be styling
That lil' bitch gimme that neck, take her on an island
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
Ran up that check at the mall, we just bought three cars
I can't shop at no mall, I'm in Neiman Marcus
Got a big Draco my lap, but I only need two shots
Bitch suck my dick three times, and I ain't even talk
Big smoke, riding 'round town with my wrist froze
Brought that bitch from the strip home
Turn that bitch into a rich hoe (Lil Purpp!)
And I'm still serving them xannies
Lil bitch came in with no panties
Boy want beef with my gang though
We gon' hit you and your family

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Amiri jeans hold the tech, that's how I be styling
That lil' bitch gimme that neck, take her on an island
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Please don't tell me these yours, these new Christian Dior
Eat rich and used to be poor, get me that lean and I pour it
Your girlfriend sticky like floor, yeah I know you saw it
Heart prints on my heart, Comme des Gar√ßons
Got on my back like chips, slap that dick on her lips
Lil Purpp bless yo trap, yeah I'm gonna bless your drip
In dreams, got weed in my lap, yeah that man filled three zips
Snake belt around my waist, holding up extended clip

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Amiri jeans hold the tech, that's how I be styling
That lil' bitch gimme that neck, take her on an island
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding

[Open Verse]


[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Amiri jeans hold the tech, that's how I be styling
That lil' bitch gimme that neck, take her on an island
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding
Run up that check at the mall, you know that we wylin'
AP with the baguettes, my wrist watersliding
