[Intro: Sosamann]
Hmm-hmm
Like, get right, you know what I'm sayin'? Hey
I got some sauce, ayy
I got some sauce, ooh
You know what I'm sayin'?
Gunna with me
Hey (Ooh)

[Chorus: Sosamann]
Been got sauce with the acres, I live like a player, my niggas surrounded by gates
White neighbors on the side of me, know they not likin' me and I know they think I'm hatin'
Ain't my birthday but I get to the cake
Diamonds on wet, they on wet like the lake
And I'm too fresh when I stepped in the place
Got money on me like I stepped out the bank, and hey
I got some sauce, ayy, ooh
I got some sauce to drip, ayy
I got some sauce, ayy, ooh
I got some sauce to drip, ayy
Yeah, ooh, I got some sauce to drip, ayy
I got some sauce, ayy
I got some sauce to drip, hey

[Verse 1: Sosamann]
Hey, ayy, yeah, yeah
I got some sauce to spill, ayy
That hatin' ain't payin' no bills, no
Rock Gucci with fur on the heels, ooh
Don't want it, it don't got a seal, for real
I play with them racks with no deal, ayy
Why beef with the boy? He a queer, ooh
Only while the bitch take the pills
Can't fuck with these niggas, some niggas is actors
And I'm not a rapper, bitch, I am a splasher
Thousand P's comin' in on a tractor
Got cheese on my head like a Packer, ooh
Make that lil' bitch call me master, ayy
Chopper might cause a disaster, ooh
Spit the good word like the pastor
I'm 'bout ballin' in the game, I ain't goin' to no practice, ayy

[Chorus: Sosamann]
Been got sauce with the acres, I live like a player, my niggas surrounded by gates
White neighbors on the side of me, know they not likin' me and I know they think I'm hatin'
Ain't my birthday but I get to the cake
Diamonds on wet, they on wet like the lake
And I'm too fresh when I stepped in the place
Got money on me like I stepped out the bank, and hey
I got some sauce, ayy, ooh
I got some sauce to drip, ayy
I got some sauce, ayy, ooh
I got some sauce to drip, ayy
Yeah, ooh, I got some sauce to drip, ayy
I got some sauce, ayy
I got some sauce to drip, hey

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I got some sauce to drip (Sauce)
I got some sauce to drip (Ayy)
I got my drawers from Fifth
She give me jaws and lips (Ayy)
They think they can't park the whips
The interior chocolate chip (Ayy)
I got a gun filled with hollow tips (Hollow tips)
Gotta trap, ain't no way I could trip
You know my bitch like a stray dog on a pill
Half a mil up and I ain't signed a deal
I can't sip it if it ain't come with a seal
I fuck my bitch good and I pay all her bills
You come in one way, ain't no way out the crib
You stack this shit up, you'll live life how I live
First of the month, I don't care 'bout the bills
'Bout to go put him some ice in his grill

[Chorus: Sosamann]
Been got sauce with the acres, I live like a player, my niggas surrounded by gates
White neighbors on the side of me, know they not likin' me and I know they think I'm hatin'
Ain't my birthday but I get to the cake
Diamonds on wet, they on wet like the lake
And I'm too fresh when I stepped in the place
Got money on me like I stepped out the bank, and hey
I got some sauce, ayy, ooh
I got some sauce to drip, ayy
I got some sauce, ayy, ooh
I got some sauce to drip, ayy
Yeah, ooh, I got some sauce to drip, ayy
I got some sauce, ayy
I got some sauce to drip, hey
