[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah

You know the type jewelry, the one that I, that I started everybody doing now
Yeah, it's Jeffery by the way you know what I'm saying
Yeah, I started you niggas by doing diamond ropes only, you know what I'm saying
I started you niggas by stacking that shit nigga
Give props when due, you know what I'm saying

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Take a little yay off vert (woah)
Stuff her with some dick and make her squirt (skeet, skeet, skeet)
Heehee, skeet it in her mouth and make her burp (burp)
Pay lil' mama bills for certain

I ain't ever goin' out sad
Fuck around and buy a bitch a bag
Cartier timeless man

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
They tryna tear me down bad (Slatt)
You niggas give me a bag (Slatt)
I told her we don't play no games (I do)

I'm killin' these boys in my sleep
You can't even afford the lil' freak
Hashtag my tats, (?)
If I take xans, I act like a brat
You broke and I can see right through that
These hoes think they trippin', y'all fucked up a sack
I do what I want, I came out the bitch mad
And rest in peace Troup, and did one for ol' Nate
And look at the stomach, you know it's so flat
I'm ridin' with the slimes and they all gon' say Slatt
Rack jumpin' jacks, take off your bag
Bitch, now you go kill
Take off the keys, white skinny pants, drinking some lean
Run up a billion, glass on the ceiling yeah
She on her period? Fuck it, nut on her ceiling then

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Take a little yay off vert (woah)
