[Hook: XVL Hendrix]
Money coming in fast, so you know that's how I spend it
All of my bitches 'bout business
[?] back to back the tenant
Black Op, I complete the mission
Pass the pint, yeah, I stay sipping
Pocket full of nothing but them Benjis
Nigga, I'm in it to win it
Nigga, I'm in it to win it
Nigga, I'm in it to win it
I get it right out when I get it
Receiving the pack with that shipment
[?]
Fell in love with them hundreds and fifties
Nigga, I'm in it to win it
Understand how God is my witness

[Verse 1: XVL Hendrix]
[?]
Yeah, this motherfucker soul plane
Got a rocket ship all on my gold chain
Why I buy to take up both lanes
I don’t got nothing but three a tank
It ain’t rocket science, I ain’t gotta explain
I want all the money, fuck the fame
I’ll give her a part of my last name
I fall in that pussy, I’m a stunt man
Pulled three in that twenty, I jump, man
Michael Jordan, so I gotta jump, man
Sipping nothing but hi-tech, let me slump, man
Gotta run that shit up everyday
Gymnastic bitch let me fuck every way
Got a nigga she let me fuck any way
Blowing up my phone every damn day
This [?], I said what I want to say
John Madden, yeah, I got the plays
Sipping venom in the Minute Maid
Throw the money up, I’ll run in your parade
Bean, [?] and [?]
Thought I was broke, [?] ‘cause I’m paid
Milly rocking ‘cause I’m [?] on the weight
Ain’t a superhero, but the bitch can get saved

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Got off with no witness
D.A. said I was a menace
Oofish young niggas don’t listen
I got my mind on the mid
Unless smoking kush, I’m a chimney
Fuck all them bitches and film it
We met them hoes up at the Hilton
They say they want Gunna and Hendrix
I still got some packs in the frigid
I had to run up them digits
I ain’t get no rest of the commission
20K go to the dentist
I told my bitch, “Wash all the dishes”
Put all of my bros on the mission
I told the hoe, fuck no restriction
She suck on that dick with the lipstick
[?] diamond like water
I call my shit the Pacific
I think my shit look like a ocean
[?] make you spend it
Diamonds, they wet like the fishes
I had to flex on you bitches
I done finessed you little bitches
Worth for the rest of the riches
