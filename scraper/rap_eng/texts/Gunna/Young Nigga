[Verse 1]
Young Gunna keep pimping
Pull up and I'm politicking
VVS's bitch I'm dripping
Got on my YSL, bitch I'm dripping
Bitch looking fly as hell and don't take pictures
Nigga get out of line, a nigga hitting
My bitch is fine as hell but she don't listen
That's why I fuck the bitch and then dismiss her
I want blue cheese only
I ain't rocking no Saucony's
Gunna gon' be the first one to own it
That shit is out of season I don't want it
I got my britches, how 'bout Ferragamo?
I got some choppers, bouta buy more ammo
I'm tryna catch a nigga, I ain't a scammer
I'm in New York and I feel like the panda
Promise I won't let up
You a pussy nigga, nigga shut up
I think these bitches dig it like a shovel
I got my cheese chip, I'm stacking cheddar
God I made it out the ghetto
I cannot lie a nigga living better
That Rover came with two umbrellas
White and black seats, I call 'em salt and pepper
I'm a rockstar, I'm toting heavy metal
Hit the gas and press the pedal
Nigga can't get no service, ain't no data
I'll cop another car, you make me madder
I could keep getting money, it don't matter
You don't like what you see then change the channel
Cause I'mma keep popping shit on every camera
Gunna Gunna with whatever

[Chorus]
Come where I'm from, gotta keep a gun nigga
Cause the young niggas gon' ride
Nigga can't run, nigga you can't hide
I come from where the young niggas die
Go get a bond nigga, flip a pot
Break down that bond nigga, make a lot
Niggas ain't real, niggas never lie
Your brother get killed nigga, and you gon' cry

[Verse 2]
You can't get what I got
I ain't no pussy, I ain't someone to try
Nigga can't take the chain or take the watch
Nigga a ghost of Gunna blow the spot
See the real in my eyes
Nigga ain't put my pyrex to no side
I'm from a mob filled with ties
She fuck me cause she like my vibe
I copped the car then I chopped the top
She want me raw dog but I'm not
I feel like a star when I'm walking out
I shoot you like Paul Pierce, I got a shot
You still playing hard, nigga need to stop
My nigga never seen the drought
And Troup like a guard living on the south
I come from where them bodies drop

[Chorus]
Come where I'm from, gotta keep a gun nigga
Cause the young niggas gon' ride
Nigga can't run, nigga you can't hide
I come from where the young niggas die
Go get a bond nigga, flip a pot
Break down that bond nigga, make a lot
Niggas ain't real, niggas never lie
Your brother get killed nigga, and you gon' cry
