[Chorus: Gunna]
Going back and forth with these hoes
I told you I drip with these clothes
'Bout to get back on the road
Bigger back end at these shows
I done came from the bottom with hope
Stack that cash up, that's all that I know
Gotta get my family a new home
Gotta go and cash out on the road

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Choke the game I got it in a yoke
My auntie used to play with that coke
I love her 'cause she kept me with hope
Boutta run that shit up like Lil Boat
This a checkerboard Damier coat
Saint Laurent  these the same color as oak
Rock Off-White still look light like the Pope
Momma told me, "that's all that she wrote"
Hopping out of these suicide doors
Got some tailor made drip on my clothes
Run that new in and out with the old
Valentino on all of my hoes
Niggas jealous they wanna be known
I know you can do better on yo own
I see basically niggas is clones
You play wrong, you get popped in yo dome
I'm just trying bring these m&m's home
I'mma try put my lil' niggas on
I don't care if you feel it or don't
Gotta get in that billionaire mode
You can't come to come kick it you told
That's a price on yo head 'till you gone
Better pray up and live with that tome
Can't go back and you know how it go

[Chorus: Gunna]
Going back and forth with these hoes
I told you I drip with these clothes
'Bout to get back on the road
Bigger back end at these shows
I done came from the bottom with hope
Stack that cash up, that's all that I know
Gotta get my family a new home
Gotta go and cash out on the road

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
50 racks stuffed in my denim
Rocking the Gucci with lion like Simba
I keep the blue hunnids with me like gang members
I get that hoe back, she just a rental
I'm in the trap spot just like a vendor
Go back and forth with these hoes
I go back and forth with these shows
A hunnid thousand got my neck on froze
I want the cookie no petro
I used to trap out the metro
Had that bitch turn to a klepto
I'm rocking Louis V head to toe
Wake up, I dress like I got a show
I need the money, the can fasho
I be dripping in designer galore
Fuck on that bitch and then I gotta go

[Chorus: Gunna]
Going back and forth with these hoes
I told you I drip with these clothes
'Bout to get back on the road
Bigger back end at these shows
I done came from the bottom with hope
Stack that cash up, that's all that I know
Gotta get my family a new home
Gotta go and cash out on the road
