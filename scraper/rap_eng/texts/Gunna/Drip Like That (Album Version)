[Pre-Chorus: Reese LAFLARE]
Keep a TEC, why I drip like that
Wipe my face with racks
Easter-colored ice, in Easter-colored cups
My niggas pourin' up (pour up)

[Verse 1: Reese LAFLARE]
Ain't no tit for tat (no tit for tat)
Ain't no back and forth with you
Oh, I'm just blowin' up (blow up)
Count that backend, it's all blues
How you feel about me, boo
Don't feel that way for you (no, no)
Good things come in two
Bring your best friend through
So just kick on back
Count them racks (count them racks)
They stealin' drip (drip)
Bitch, we taxin' (taxin')
Feel like Michael dancin'
Billie Jean, arm got that glitter action (it glisten, ice, ice, ice)
They ask me what I'm on (ice)
Bitch, it's acid
Jesus pieces on me, that's a resurrection (resurrection)
Style just like Harry, I got one direction (one direction)
Get him whacked for Twitter talkin', that's an instant message (instant message)
Tell him get the message, ya dig?

[Pre-Chorus: Reese LAFLARE]
Keep a TEC, why I drip like that (drip)
Wipe my face with racks (then what?)
Easter-colored ice, in Easter-colored cups (okay)
My niggas pourin' up (lil' skate)

[Chorus: Reese LAFLARE]
'Cause I drip like that (I drip like that)
I drip like that (drip)
Keep a TEC (drip)
Why I drip like that (drip)
Wipe my face with racks (them racks)
Easter-colored ice (drip)
In Easter-colored cups (then what?)
My niggas pourin' up (pour up)
'Cause I drip like that (drip)
Drip like that (drip)

[Bridge: Reese LAFLARE]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why you drip like that?
Ooh, why you drip like that?

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Han, drip like candle wax (drip like candle wax)
Told her ride that dick like camel back (camel back)
New Philipp Plein online, I shop on the internet (on internet)
Maybach seat reclaim, away to another check
Han, Young Gunna why you drip like that? (drip like that)
Run through all these hoes they said a million yet (a million yet)
Your bitch at home alone, just sent me a freaky text (a freaky text)
I put that shit on her, that pussy drippin' wet (drippin' wet)
I copped the new Balenciaga socks (Balenciaga socks)
I got more syrup than a wafflehouse (than a wafflehouse)
When it comes to the drip, I never ever have a drop (have a drop)
Me and Wheezy on that drip, these nigga cap a bop
I got a presidential suite that's at the top (that's at the top)
I'm drippin when I walk, you gonna need a mop(need a mop)
Hit your bitch from the balcony in new Gucci flops (new Gucci flops)
Tell these hoes out here, I ain't gon' leave the top

[Pre-Chorus: Reese LAFLARE]
Keep a TEC, why I drip like that (drip)
Wipe my face with racks (then what?)
Easter-colored ice, in Easter-colored cups (okay)
My niggas pourin' up (lil' skate)

[Chorus: Reese LAFLARE]
'Cause I drip like that (I drip like that)
I drip like that (drip)
Keep a TEC (drip)
Why I drip like that (drip)
Wipe my face with racks (them racks)
Easter-colored ice (drip)
In Easter-colored cups (then what?)

'Cause I drip like that (drip)
Drip like that (drip)

[Bridge: Reese LAFLARE]
Yeah, yeah

[Outro: Reese LAFLARE]
