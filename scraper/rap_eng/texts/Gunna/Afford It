[Hook: kkruggerr]
She say "How you afford it?" (somehow)
Bitch I can pay your mortgage
All that green like a tortoise
Now I'm flyin' cross the border
She give me neck like a choker
Now I'm laughin' like a joker
No I don't want your daughter
Bitch I'm aimin' at your mother
(x2)

[Verse 1: sktboo]
Dont think I can't afford it
Brand new whip thats imported
Got some hunchos in storage
6ixers can't be extorted
Dont you come near with that bullshit
If I wanna start it, I push it
I be flexin' hard, I can't help it
Flexin' hard, I can't help it
Imma pull up like them Celtics
Thats that green four leaf clover
And you cool but a nigga be colder
Be cool before them niggas get on you
At your front door like Jahovas
Oldhead talkin' bout they daughter
I dont want her, I dont want her
Gotta step back from marijuana
Now a nigga be focused
Bitches they rub on me like some lotion
I got some goons and they totin'
Do what I say, they just go with the motion
And my left pocket your mortgage, my right pocket overflowin'
And she steady keep asking me
Steady keep asking me

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Slaughtered your daughter
Got prescriptions from my doctor
Hits like The Carter
Got my drip from Mr. Porter
[?] european
I been smashed and passed the model
Six hundred bands, I can't let you bitches follow
Rackends in the safe, I'm tryna stack up every dollar
Stick inside my crib, [?] for all problems
Balenciaga [?] they put [?] on my collar
Your bitch a whole head hunter, I gave her cash cause she swallow
Stackin' these blue faces, I got gas and gelato
[?] and feed your fam, thats the motto
Cop a new bentley truck, and a lamb, yeah pronto
Balmain on your head, Goyard bag, filled with huncho

[Verse 3: kkruggerr]
[?] in love with kkruggerr, dont be grabbin' on my collar
You be gettin no guala, but you spreading all these rumors
Hair getting long like the wrong end, you ain't got no daddy, why you roamin'
No need for ten fold, back that ass up nice tempo
I'm a jackass like Steve-O, how you spend cash on a freak hoe
Bitch wanna get it on like [?]
Im single
And I'm kinda bright like twinkle, can't comprehend my lingo
Nigga where the MILF at, bingo, Imma put her ass in the friendzone
Can we still be friends and still bone, [?] bitch the fuck on
6ixers all up in your ear, [?] and that's all you gon' hear
Takin' a look in the mirror, stuntin' lil niggas I know that they fear
Bro, why she keep asking me? Why she keep asking me?

[Outro: kkruggerr]
She say "How you afford it?"
She say "How you afford it?" (how you afford it?)
