[Intro]

[Chorus: 88 Camino]
Need a girl that puts in work for those racks
Yeah, then she brings them back to dad
Need a girl that puts in work for those racks
Yeah, and she brings them to back to daddy

[Verse 1: Derek Wise & 88 Camino]
Fashionable killer, ice like the winter, I'm puttin' you under arrest
Cuffin' a winner, cuff in the winter, princess cut diamonds the best
I'ma remember, give you the world, you my Jasmine, Aladdin, no cap
Trap with a MAC, we just be floatin', and she brings it back to daddy (Yeah)
Shirt cost a rack, name on your tat, first class, we pull up to LAX
I can't go back, brick in my bag, now I come clean like a bath, uh
She wanna dance
Meringue my pendant, Pusseno the watch on my hand
Vegas, I'm doin' the damage
Five hundred C-notes that's stacked in my bag
Coolin' my jets, ain't Snapchattin' pics to look cool on a jet (Yeah)
Uber arrived, while you pool to the 'jects (Yeah)
Rick Owen on, I'm not new to this dress (Yeah), super my flex
Flew to the west, XO the gang, ain't no foolin' the set (Ah)
Upgraded house, got a pool and a fence (Brr)
Shooter beside me, they cool with the ref, blew in a tech

[Chorus: 88 Camino]
Need a girl that puts in work for those racks
Yeah, then she brings them back to dad
Need me a bitch that puts in work for those racks
Yeah, and she brings them to back to daddy

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, sip some syrup, then relax
I got birds in the trap
I got curtains in the back, yeah (Curtains in the back)
Put the whole city on my back
Quarter milli' in my bag
I'm goin' shoppin' when I land, uh
I fill a Backwood up with weed
I got a few hoes overseas, uh
Turned to a car, ride the beat, uh (Skrrt)
Turbo can't stay off the keys, uh
Hop out the Porsche to a Jeep, uh (Skrrt)
Bitch dressin' up like a cheap ho
Seen me count up me some G's, yeah
All my sauce covered with G's, uh
Cut me a check
The only ones talkin' I know ain't a threat
I'm a big boss, I can double the bet
She mad 'cause I keep ignorin' her texts (Yeah)
YSLXO, family 'til we dead (Oh)
I fell asleep with two hoes in my bed
Get what you want and you don't gotta beg
Bean had me geeked so I poured up some red

[Chorus: 88 Camino]
Need a girl that puts in work for those racks
Yeah, then she brings them back to dad
Need me a bitch that puts in work for those racks
Yeah, and she brings them to back to daddy

[Verse 3: 88 Camino]
I rock Chanel when I flex at banquet
That Chevy Impala, it creep through your ends
Can't trust these bitches and no more new friends
Feel like Sid Vicious, I hop out the Benz
I got a car and I came from the 'jects
I feel like Mozart, I play with those keys
She say, "Te amo," I don't speak no Spanish
I rock Chanel when I flex at the banquet
Young nigga glamorous, twinkly twink
Drown in my drip, man, I swear I can't sink
Fuck at the office off one or two drinks
Dippin' my pen in this company ink

[Chorus: 88 Camino]
Need a girl that puts in work for those racks
Yeah, then she brings them back to dad
Need me a bitch that puts in work for those racks
Yeah, and she brings them to back to daddy
