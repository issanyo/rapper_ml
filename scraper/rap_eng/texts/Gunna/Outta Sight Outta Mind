[Intro]
Power, power, power, power
Yeah
Gunna, ooo, ooo, yeah

[Chorus]
If you outta sight, you outta mind
You gotta stack, you gotta grind
I'm statin' facts, these niggas lyin'
You can't relax and keep wastin' time
I want the racks, I gotta get mine
Stackin' it up, I work wit' a stride
I went from a deuce, turnt up to a nine
I sleep with the stars, I know I'ma shine

[Post-Chorus]
Same price as the rent, that's the cost for the kicks
I'm stackin' up racks just to make a hit list
My nigga El Chapo' will chop off ya wrist
Pull up wit' them choppas, I know I won't miss
Some niggas get locked up, and turned to a snitch
But I kept it solid and hard as a brick
Winked at your bitch, she want give me a kiss
Walked in that bit' I was drippin' like piss

[Verse 1]
Bought an AP, and took my wrist out of the pot
Pop a bottle of Aces, and pour that shit out
Put some diamonds and chandeliers all in the spot
How many racks does this young nigga got?
I flew to Dubai, I didn't go to DeVry
Hunnit racks to put the jet in the sky
Time is music, this the best you could buy
I'm drippin' bitches, niggas still think they still fly
I think I'm the flyest, I ain't got no stylist
I'm geeked up off Molly, I'm fucking on Cyrus​
I flew wit' a choppa, I might catch a body
Cause I see these fake niggas through the Cavalli's
I got with my locs and we reunited
These niggas quote poems, and they bitches like it
I didn't turn a hoe, when I got indited
If I catch a case, then I gotta fight it
My nigga called shawty, he ride with the shottie
We pull up in Rari's, these niggas don't like us
Smoke weed and sip lean and get money, my vices
My frienemies Poison and I know they shiesty
I pray to the lord and he know that I'm righteous
I need a reward 'cause they say I'm the nicest
Got too many bros, they gon' roll out the dices
I stay out the way 'cause niggas like mices

[Chorus]
If you outta sight, you outta mind
You gotta stack, you gotta grind
I'm statin' facts, these niggas lyin'
You can't relax and keep wastin' time
I want the racks, I gotta get mine
Stackin' it up, I work wit' a stride
I went from a deuce, turnt up to a nine
I sleep with the stars, I know I'ma shine

[Post-Chorus]
Same price as the rent, that's the cost for the kicks
I'm stackin' up racks just to make a hit list
My nigga El Chapo' will chop off ya wrist
Pull up wit' them choppas, I know I won't miss
Some niggas get locked up, and turned to a snitch
But I kept it solid and hard as a brick
Winked at your bitch, she want give me a kiss
Walked in that bit' I was drippin' like piss

[Verse 2]
Put the dick in her mouth, and its fuck what you say
Fuck the law, blow the police away
I blew a 50, 'cause I had a long day
When it come to money, I done came a long way
I fucked the bitch, but I can't go on a date
She sucked me loose, I put some nut on her face
Let her see the loft, she gotta fuck at my place
I'm steady bossin', bitch I'm havin' my way
Niggas in the trap, but can't get away
But I've been 'round the world, it feel like I'm tourin'
I’m livin' life, I swear I know your life borin'
Mama said don't stop, I gotta keep goin'
The house so big, the bed room got an alarm
The necklace cost so much it came wit' a charm
The diamonds drippin' like the rain when it stormy
These niggas say that they lookin', well I'm finna' show 'em
So many acres it look like a farm
23 Million like I'm Michael Jordan
2 or 3 bitches, they wanna come join
Fuck all these bitches, I feel like a Don
I looked in the mirror, I know I'm the one
You ain't gonna shoot,but you carry a gun
Niggas act tough, don't want to bury your son
Had to stay down, stack them racks through the month

[Chorus]
If you outta sight, you outta mind
You gotta stack, you gotta grind
I'm statin' facts, these niggas lyin'
You can't relax and keep wastin' time
I want the racks, I gotta get mine
Stackin' it up, I work wit' a stride
I went from a deuce, turnt up to a nine
I sleep with the stars, I know I'ma shine

[Post-Chorus]
Same price as the rent, that's the cost for the kicks
I'm stackin' up racks just to make a hit list
My nigga El Chapo' will chop off ya wrist
Pull up wit' them choppas, I know I won't miss
Some niggas get locked up, and turned to a snitch
But I kept it solid and hard as a brick
Winked at your bitch, she want give me a kiss
Walked in that bit' I was drippin' like piss

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
