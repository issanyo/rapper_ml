[Chorus]
I took that drip all the way cross the border
That two door Maybach shit that came with some stars
I stood on this shit, I don't get an award
All the new whips comin' with a push start
I don't fear shit but I rock fear of god
Took the spaceship and I landed on Mars, ah

[Verse 1]
Oh, Wheezy the wave, need a board yeah
You rich when you make it on Forbes, yeah
We winnin', stop checkin' the score, yeah
We can live with no warning
Spur of the moment
But it's war if you want it
Get too much of this money, buyin' too many guns, they treat me like a god
Too many keys to these exotic cars
Too many freaks, I been fuckin' a foreign
If you niggas fly then I must be airborne
Won't pay you no mind and they gon' pay me more
Hopped in the coupe, let the Tesla charge
I keep the strap 'cause I really be knownin'
I can't imagine my family poor
But I can see my mama in Dior
We walk inside and they closin' the store
You niggas ain't drippin' like Gunna the boy
Geekin' up and it's already a sport
Jeep and it's clanging, the engine it roaring
Fiending so much I don't know what to pour
In middle school when I jumped off the porch
Good in the hood, had to dodge all the narcs
I made it out, gotta live with some scars
Protectin' your family, you gotta go hard
The way my drip set, that shit come with a scar

[Chorus]
I took that drip all the way cross the border
That two door Maybach should've came with some stars
I stood on this shit, I don't get an award
All the new whips comin' with a push start
I don't fear shit but I rock fear of god
Took the spaceship and I landed on Mars, ah

[Verse 2]
Wheezy wave, I got a board
Balmain jeans cut like a sword
I'm drippin' sauce like it's sore
I'm one of the owners
Car not a loaner
I want carats and pointers
I really fuck with lil shawty, I pay for whatever she order
My brothers get jammed, we cash out on a lawyer
Gunna always have your back like a spoiler
Some happen, I gotta look out for your daughter
You cappin', I'm rappin' my shit, you ignorin'
Saving the profit, our business is growin'
They felt sunny days and they wish for a storm
Fly in the sky, young nigga airborne
Wiring account, money come in all sorts
I really trapped out that Honda Accord
My chopper my pillow when I'm in the war
Blue hundreds my reason, lil nigga what's yours?
She tell me she cummin', I'm strokin' it more
Thinkin' that time we go big like the Hulk
Feel me, you thought I wouldn't make it at all
Get rich and I still gotta duck all the law
Shut the fuck up, I don't need you to talk
I ran up the millions just watching you walk
You never gon' win when you droppin' the salt

[Chorus]
I took that drip all the way cross the border
That two door Maybach should've came with some stars
I stood on this shit, I don't get an award
All the new whips comin' with a push start
I don't fear shit but I rock fear of god
Took the spaceship and I landed on Mars, ah
