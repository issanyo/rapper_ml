[Intro: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Shad da God]
Me and Shad geekin' on that syrup, drank a whole pint
No syrup if it's all workin'

[Chorus: Shad da God]
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
Ninety-nine bands, count that shit up in my hands
Ninety-nine bands and I could not pop the xan, ayy
Hundred fresh bitch, no show, it was all worth
Niggas got it backwards, they ain't trap, they tried to ball first

[Verse 1: Shad da God]
Niggas gotta hit first
Gotta bust a jugg first, gotta sell the dope first
Gotta hit a lick first, gotta reach a brick first
Gotta do some frauds first, gotta beat the odds first
Gotta dodge a lick it hurts, streets be hotter than the first
(What you on?), I'm high as a chinchilla fur
We sippin' lean while we lurk, we lookin' for his t-shirt
I gave that bitch a perc first, a yellow perc
And I fucked her 'til she squirt, and I fucked her 'til she hurt
Trap cellphone ringin', all it do is dirt
Chickens chickens, all it flip
They be curry, they be jerk
Chicken on the fuckin' syrup, made a thirty on a lurk
And we from by [?] Church

[Chorus: Shad da God]
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
Ninety-nine bands, count that shit up in my hands
Ninety-nine bands and I could not pop the xan, ayy
Hundred fresh bitch, no show, it was all worth
Niggas got it backwards, they ain't trap, they tried to ball first

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah I gotta thank the lord at first
Now it's Versace drawers and blue hundreds off of hard work
Gunna been stackin' it tall, tell the truth, don't know how much I'm worth
Gunna still drippin' it all, Saint Laurent on all of my t-shirts
I'm gettin' higher than Celine, percs up in my [?] tea
Call my six now, need my lean and percs, I'm an alien
I done flew that spaceship back to Earth, Bentley not the Benz
And my bitch Chromehearts in college sure, got your bitch in my bag
Let me stick my dick inside of her
Don't take this for granted, had to go get this shit out the dirt
Ninety-nine bands in my pants, you know what these dollars worth
Count this cash with my hands, I do all the work

[Chorus: Shad da God]
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
Ninety-nine bands, count that shit up in my hands
Ninety-nine bands and I could not pop the xan, ayy
Hundred fresh bitch, no show, it was all worth
Niggas got it backwards, they ain't trap, they tried to ball first

[Verse 3: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I put some diamonds in my chain, it look like Starburst, iced the Audemar first
Went and got the Rollie next, princess cuts mixed with baguettes
And my whole team got chains on, rings like the championships
Nigga we ball like it's rec, thick lil bitch and we get wet
Ooh, call me PJ nigga, I'm signed to the private jets
Signed to them Ben Franklins, my wrist look like a fish tank
Nigga I'm signed to the bank, I'm higher than a [?] pint
Chopsticks with no race, diamonds look like kryptonite
Superman tryna save that ho, I fucked her last night
Worried 'bout that bitch, you should be out here gettin' your cash right
Ninety-nine bands came, I spent that on my blow chain
Avianne ice a new chain, and I put ice on my frame

[Chorus: Shad da God]
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
We don't need no money counter like we count a hundred
Ninety-nine bands, count that shit up in my hands
Ninety-nine bands and I could not pop the xan, ayy
Hundred fresh bitch, no show, it was all worth
Niggas got it backwards, they ain't trap, they tried to ball first
