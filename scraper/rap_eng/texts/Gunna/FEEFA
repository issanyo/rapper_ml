[Chorus: Gunna]
Trapped on one stop, served my own block, bought my own watch (Own watch)
Loaded Glock, lettin' that thing pop (Pop), they can't freeze us (Freeze us)
Skybox, we been at the top, they can't see us (See us)
Big knots, fuck the dirty cops (Hey Michael)
They can't seize nothin'
Big shot, fuck that little thot, I don't need y'all
I stay high, fucked her and forgot, like amnesia
Real fly, yellow Prada socks, Bumblebee, huh
Went and got, Dior suit and tie, Christian clean, huh

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
The streets so cold, gotta ride wit' a pole
Gotta stay ready for the smoke, 'cause niggas tryna take my soul
I can't go
Thought niggas was my bros, but they changed though
Niggas don't know shit 'bout that
How the fuck a nigga switch like that?
Gotta ride with a stick 'bout that
Pull a grip from the hip like that
Keep it around me, I can't never lack
Niggas around me, they stay with the strap
Move from around me, or you could get whacked
I see an opp and I'm leavin' him flat, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Percocet, bitches on me, I'm a walkin' brand
Stackin' these bands, show like 80 a grand, hoes in the sprinter van
Pullin' up sprayin', bullet holes in the trash cans, I'ma erase your man
Gunna again, I'll never follow your trend, nigga, you do what you can

[Chorus: Gunna]
Trapped on one stop, served my own block, bought my own watch (Own watch)
Loaded Glock, lettin' that thing pop (Pop), they can't freeze us (Freeze us)
Skybox, we been at the top, they can't see us (See us)
Big knots, fuck the dirty cops, they can't seize nothin'
Big shot, fuck that little thot, I don't need y'all
I stay high, fucked her and forgot, like amnesia
Real fly, yellow Prada socks, Bumblebee, huh
Went and got, Dior suit and tie, Christian clean, huh

[Verse 3: 6ix9ine]
I can't sleep, just took 'em off 15
Had to break it down to three
Get on one knee
I prayed to the lord that he'd watch my family
Thinking this bitch gon' wait on me
Thinking my fans remember me
Thinking my friends remember me
Nigga, don't switch up on me
Can't tell me shit, 'specially not no bitch
Ten for ten with this shit
I'ma still drop these hits, I'ma still pop my shit
Got a Draco with the kick
Glock .30, hollow tips
Ride around with that shit all on my hip
See an opp, let it hit
Lately, I been on some "suck my dick" shit

[Outro: 6ix9ine]
Bitch, I'm stressin', oh, bitch, I'm stressin'
Mama sayin', "Don't cry, count your blessings"
I can't sleep, I can't sleep
(Hey, Michael)
I can't, uh
