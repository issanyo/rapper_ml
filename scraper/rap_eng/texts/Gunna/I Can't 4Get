(Run that back, Turbo)
(Playmakers)

[Chorus: Gunna]
I can't forget (Nah)
I can't forget about all my niggas (Nah)
I can't forget 'bout them hittas
I can't forget 'bout my niggas
I can't forget 'bout the bros, [?]
I'm cold like a freezer on froze
Just gettin' it like I'm supposed to

[Verse 1: Gunna]
[?]
Just rocked a mofuckin' show
[?] the backend
Mama I'm bringin' these racks in
[?]
Diamonds is wet, need a napkin
[?]
Pour up a four of the medical
Actavis [?]
[?]
Slime on a nigga like [?]

[Chorus: Gunna]
I can't forget (Nah)
I can't forget about all my niggas (Nah)
I can't forget 'bout them hittas
I can't forget 'bout my niggas
I can't forget 'bout the bros, [?]
I'm cold like a freezer on froze
Just gettin' it like I'm supposed to

[Verse 2: UnoTheActivist]
I can't forget

All of the thoughts if you look in my brain
[?] tax if you shop with the gang, yeah, gang
