[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
I go zero to a hunnid nigga real quick
This ain't no prop for no video, this a real stick
Bad bitch real bad and she real thick
Fuck up a bag, get it back on a quick flip
I'm spending cash, ay
I do the dash, ay
Fuck up a bag, yeah
Get it right back, yeah
Bitch you blowing racks, yeah

[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
I fuck up me a bag, yeah
Get it right back on the back end
See bitch you know them bags in
So tell that nigga back in
See I be spending money how I wanna spend it
Go shopping in LA, we don't shop at Lennox
And we gon' get this money as long as they print it
Screaming free all of my niggas that caught 'em a sentence
I'm living fast, yeah

And for a bag she'll fuck me for a bag, yeah
We Saint Laurents, yeah
Ain't gotta front, yeah

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
I go zero to a hunnid nigga real quick

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Masi' got 230 on the dashboard
I rewhip that clean from out that dope bowl
Young Gunna get that cash out the asshole
You niggas ain't got more money then my last hoe
How you get that spaceship on the land?
How you fit 500 in yo pants?
Why you took a perky and a xan?
How you fill that bag up with 10 grams?
Five racks nigga that's the back end
My momma saw me bring that cash in
Dripping fashion, I'm still in Saks Fifth
Another season you look like last year

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
I go zero to a hunnid nigga real quick
This ain't no prop for no video, this a real stick
Bad bitch real bad and she real thick
Fuck up a bag, get it back on a quick flip
I'm spending cash, ay
I do the dash, ay
Fuck up a bag, yeah
Get it right back, yeah
Bitch you blowing racks, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Duke]
Hop in the foreign
I do the dash, yeah
My bitch not foreign
She got a bag, yeah
Go from zero to a hunnid nigga real quick
This ain't no movie gun, nigga this a real stick
I'm tryna run up some cash
I'mma go do the whole dashboard
Thumb through that money like fast forward
Walk through the party, I'm sharp as a sword
You little niggas ain't making no noise
Not having no paper and being unemployed
Beat up the trap just like Floyd
Stretch out the clip and we boarding
Used to be broke, used to have nothing and look at me now, I'm important
I used to break on the tours
Sing to yo bitch like a chorus
Thumbing through money, now only blue hunnids, we kicking that shit like a punter
Just like Katana I made me a play, and the back of that bih made of hunnids
I put that dick in yo bih like a plumber
It's a YSL year, yeah this our summer
Money keep getting long like anaconda
Getting them thing by the bundle, soon as they come in we running
Sipping that lean like a junkie
Guapo he throw me that alley, I dunk it
Popping them xannies, we walking like zombies
Boy you don't get it, lil' boy you get fronted

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
I go zero to a hunnid nigga real quick
This ain't no prop for no video, this a real stick
Bad bitch real bad and she real thick
Fuck up a bag, get it back on a quick flip
I'm spending cash, ay
I do the dash, ay
Fuck up a bag, yeah
Get it right back, yeah
Bitch you blowing racks, yeah
