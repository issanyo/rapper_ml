[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
These niggas got me fucked up
See 'em in the street like what's up?
Catch 'em down bad, get bust up
None of my niggas no busters
All of my niggas got bustdowns
Run through the sack when I touch down
Sold 'em and ain't even touched 'em
My plug he just landed from Russia
I go to the hole and I score the bucket
Pretty lil bitch want to suck it
Remember them days I had nothing
I got all this shit off of hustling
Headshot, my niggas ain't aiming at no leg shot
Red dots, all you little pussy niggas gotta die
Cook up, I cook up a pie
Southside and shout out to Pie
All of my bitches they bi
Everywhere I got a fire
I drop the top at the red light
I get you shot if you say it twice
Percocet, yeah that's a med night
I want some head tonight
You get a verse if your bread right
I'm on a private flight
I got a bitch, she a head doctor
Can't say too much 'cause the feds watching

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
I'm just bench pressin' all these hoes
Still rockin' designer clothes
White bitch playin' with they nose
Look at that bad bitch on that pole
We show up and we sell out shows
You know it's bros over hoes

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Chasin' that bread 'til I get it
Hop in that 'Vette, I'ma hit it
I'm on the way to the riches
Mission to go get these millions
Constantly dodgin' the sentence
Hop out, I jump over fences
I'm havin' more hoes than Hendrix
I call up my boy, I pour up a four
I told you it's bros over bitches
You broke niggas never gon' listen
I won an award, got suicide doors
I'm knockin' the doors off the hinges
I kill it, I don't want to end it
Got water all over my arm
I struggled all way to the morn'
They dig it, they say I'm a charm
That ting on me large
We cashin', not swipin' these cards
I'm thinkin' 'bout coppin' a Porsche
And Gunna he gonna get more

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
I'm just bench pressin' all these hoes
Still rockin' designer clothes
White bitch playin' with they nose
Look at that bad bitch on that pole
We show up and we sell out shows
You know it's bros over hoes
