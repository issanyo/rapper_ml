[Chorus: Blacc Zacc]
Ayy I took my shades off, I'm tryna see who got a check
I ran that bag up and put some ice up on my neck
Don't ever disrespect me, know my class is VVS
It's gang gang bitch, and I ain't worryin' about the rest
Ayy, I traded sleep for success
Damn, I traded sleep for success
I traded sleep for success
Gang gang nigga, and I ain't worryin' 'bout the rest

[Verse 1: Blacc Zacc]
Ayy, I took the Carters off, I'm tryna see who got a check
And I ain't come to party, I only party for the check
Shawty I don't do no date, I'm here for pussy and some neck
Don't ever disrespect, you know these diamonds VVS
I left my old ho 'cause she couldn't keep the pussy wet
I fired my old shooter, he took to long to get 'em whacked
I see that bankroll, but boy you got that off of rap
I got them thangs bro, I brought this jewelry from the trap
No cap, I keep straps
No sleep, I sacrificed that
Get money, seven days a week
You don't hustle, that means you don't eat
I'm tryna see it

[Chorus: Blacc Zacc]
Ayy I took my shades off, I'm tryna see who got a check
I ran that bag up and put some ice up on my neck
Don't ever disrespect me, know my class is VVS
It's gang gang bitch, and I ain't worryin' about the rest
Ayy, I traded sleep for success
Damn, I traded sleep for success
I traded sleep for success
Gang gang nigga, and I ain't worryin' 'bout the rest

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I come with my gang, I don't care 'bout the rest
Ice all inside the Patek
Cuban link chokers 'round the turtleneck
Quans, I got 'em all black
These shits is pricey, cost a couple stacks
These niggas play crazy 'til they get whacked
I got on these shades tryna see these lil racks
I'm wearing my jeans, I got 'em from Saks
YSL nigga say slatt
Yeah, this Saint Laurent cover my back
My bro go this shit off the pack
It's nothing but loyalty, that's a known fact
You talk when I'm turning my back
You text like a ho in the chat
Sippin' on syrup, it's so relaxin'
Bacon, it come back to back
Can't love a whore and getting attached
Finessing the game for like ten
Get you some M's, catch a Ford Flex
This ain't a regular Benz, pillows inside the Maybach

[Chorus: Blacc Zacc]
Ayy I took my shades off, I'm tryna see who got a check
I ran that bag up and put some ice up on my neck
Don't ever disrespect me, know my class is VVS
It's gang gang bitch, and I ain't worryin' about the rest
Ayy, I traded sleep for success
Damn, I traded sleep for success
I traded sleep for success
Gang gang nigga, and I ain't worryin' 'bout the rest
