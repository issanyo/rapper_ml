[Intro: Lil Chi Chi]
Man, you niggas really shrimp, you niggas really small
You niggas something like peasants, man
We do not fuck with you niggas, man
Back up, please back away from us, man
Fuck niggas

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
No, we don't fuck with no fuck niggas
Fuck them, my chopper got nuts, nigga
You know what the fuck going on with my pimping
It's on me, nigga, you'll never catch me slipping
I got good aim, I don't need no extension
Most of these niggas, they act like some bitches
Got some young niggas on making the hit list
These niggas know that we fucking they bitches
No, we don't fuck with them fuck niggas
No, we don't fuck with them fuck niggas
I can't fuck around with no fuck niggas
Scary pussy-ass duck niggas
Your momma know that you a fuck nigga
Your daddy know that you a fuck nigga
Your partner them, yeah, they some fuck niggas
I don't fuck around with no fuck niggas

[Verse 1: Neechie]
Fuck niggas making me sick
I'll walk around with a stick
Put a nigga in the dirt
Put a 30 in your shirt
I'll have you wet as a bitch
My diamonds yellow like piss
Poured the water, got me fucking your bitch
Broke steering wheel, whipping the Bentley
I hit your block with a brick
Turned a ten into a forty
And now my wrist a McFlurry
Y'all niggas cold as a bitch
I'm having ice, I could fuck your wife any night
You a football, but you need some stripes
Catch you lacking, boy, it's S.O.S. and yeah, we shoot on sight

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Can't trust a nigga, I might bust a nigga
Hit him up and won't nobody know it
That talk is cheap, I'll let that chopper speak
Your body leaking, screaming for the Lord
You pop that shit, ain't no more stopping shit
Pull up with choppers, we chopping shit
30/30, that's that 60-clip
Pablo hoodrich with them 60 Crips
We pick it up state after state
Letting these fuck niggas hate
Fuck the laws and the State
I ain't got nothing but rats on my plate
And I want some racks in the safe
Told these fuck niggas keep hating
Pull up, riding in the Wraith
This shit [?] you bitches the bank

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
No, we don't fuck with no fuck niggas
Fuck them, my chopper got nuts, nigga
You know what the fuck going on with my pimping
It's on me, nigga, you'll never catch me slipping
I got good aim, I don't need no extension
Most of these niggas, they act like some bitches
Got some young niggas on making the hit list
These niggas know that we fucking they bitches
No, we don't fuck with them fuck niggas
No, we don't fuck with them fuck niggas
I can't fuck around with no fuck niggas
Scary pussy-ass duck niggas

[Verse 3: Gunna]
We don't fuck 'round with no fuck niggas
Pull up, hop out and they tucking their chain
Made myself a boss and they know all my names
220 on the dash, ain't talking 'bout Dame
I'm a big dog and I run with Great Danes
I came from the block, I was serving them J's
Three for the five, had the block going crazy
Been had finesse, I was born in the eighties
Niggas can't try me, I've sent them to Grady
Dude wanna scrap and left them on the pavement
You roll with gorillas, my niggas apes
We smashing and passing these bitches, no saving
Can't fuck with these niggas, these niggas be hating
Been having flavor, I've been having paper
Flew a Pinto out to Vegas
Racked it up, I don't give a fuck 'bout no haters

[Verse 4: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I swear to God, man, them pussy niggas and them fuck niggas be the worst
You want to Twitter beef, but it's personal
These niggas be asking for mercy
Robbing and serving before I was rapping verses
These pussy ass niggas some turkeys
My niggas kidnap and they lurk
Protocol, nigga: we see you, we murking
I don't fuck around with no fuck niggas
I ain't never pulled if I ain't bust, nigga
From the streets, keep the pistol is a must, nigga
I got something for you fake tough niggas
Duck niggas better duck, nigga
All of my niggas don't give no fuck, nigga
Chopper with the nuts, busting at fuck niggas
I'm in the streets with the crooks and the drug dealers

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
No, we don't fuck with no fuck niggas
Fuck them, my chopper got nuts, nigga
You know what the fuck going on with my pimping
It's on me, nigga, you'll never catch me slipping
I got good aim, I don't need no extension
Most of these niggas, they act like some bitches
Got some young niggas on making the hit list
These niggas know that we fucking they bitches
No, we don't fuck with them fuck niggas
No, we don't fuck with them fuck niggas
I can't fuck around with no fuck niggas
Scary pussy-ass duck niggas
Your momma know that you a fuck nigga
