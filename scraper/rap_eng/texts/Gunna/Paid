[Chorus]
Tryna find paradise, I ain't tryna see that light
I been prayin' through life, but some things just ain't right
We ball every Saturday night, takin' private long flights
I been covered in ice, money stay on my mind
Gotta get paid, gon' get paid
Gon' get paid, gon' get paid, ooh

[Verse 1]
I got real hundreds in the brief
Lately I ain't been gettin' no sleep
Why the pain it make me weak
I got dope in my IV
I can't patiently wait
I'm securing all my needs
Hundred way to go get paid
That's the subject they should teach
Went to school, checked out my niece, I missed her face
Workin' in these streets, hard for my family to reach
Still they searchin', tryna see, make a way
The motto is to get paid, stack a dollar every day

[Chorus]
Tryna find paradise, I ain't tryna see that light
I been prayin' through life, but some things just ain't right
We ball every Saturday night, takin' private long flights
I been covered in ice, money stay on my mind
Gotta get paid, gon' get paid
Gon' get paid, gon' get paid, ooh

[Verse 2]
Rockin' iced out Cuban links
Cartiers, I still can't see
Dodgin' money laundry
Wash the cash, it came back clean
Gucci pinstripes, not no jeans
Gucci collar, bumblebees
My lock be double-G's
Rockin' highwaters up to my knees
Talk to god when I get on my knees
Thank the lord, we pray
Mama got a smile on her face
All of my niggas is straight
Came off the top of that A, my name hold weight
Money growin' like my age
Partner 'nem seein' better days

[Chorus]
Tryna find paradise, I ain't tryna see that light
I been prayin' through life, but some things just ain't right
We ball every Saturday night, takin' private long flights
I been covered in ice, money stay on my mind
Gotta get paid, gon' get paid
Gon' get paid, gon' get paid, ooh
