[Chorus]
Imma grind, get this paper
Imma shine on a hater, yeah
Build a mine, I got acres
Diamond ring, I go glacier, yeah
And I came from out that jungle, I'm gon eat when I get hungry
Had my back against the wall I had to face off my opponents
If I trip or fall or stumble I'm bouncing back and getting back on it
Get that check up every morning, gotta get it if you want it

[Verse 1]
Money talks, my favourite conversation
I fuck that money and give it penetration
Private flight came with no invitation
When it come to paper I had to practice patience
Had no transportation, had to use the Marta station
Now we ride in spaceships, inside of the coupe it's spacious
On the jet getting faded, flew out the whole crew to Vegas
Smells like we make it, racks so long from here to Macon
Stood out on these niggas, I'm so outstanding
Had to get rich, couldn't do that shit without planning
When you take a fall nigga don't panic
Gotta give that shit your all, bet you don't fail it

[Chorus]
Imma grind, get this paper
Imma shine on a hater, yeah
Build a mine, I got acres
Diamond ring, I go glacier, yeah
And I came from out that jungle, I'm gon eat when I get hungry
Had my back against the wall I had to face off my opponents
If I trip or fall or stumble I'm bouncing back and getting back on it
Get that check up every morning, gotta get it if you want it

[Verse 2]
Told all of my bros we gon be on
Told myself I had to make this shit just on my own
When shit got real, I still had your back when you was wrong
When we get Ms, I'm gon try to bring my nigga home
My Rosetta Stones, nigga sit me on a throne
I just got a dome, then I left that hoe alone
I'm just tryna grind, make a million worth of songs
Cop a Patek for my mum, she gon know her son the don
Got that AP on I feel apologetic
When I fell in love with money that shit was so romantic
Get them racks and cuff em, hide em in the attic
I dun got so high, I dun forgot I had it

[Chorus]
Imma grind, get this paper
Imma shine on a hater, yeah
Build a mine, I got acres
Diamond ring, I go glacier, yeah
And I came from out that jungle, I'm gon eat when I get hungry
Had my back against the wall I had to face off my opponents
If I trip or fall or stumble I'm bouncing back and getting back on it
Get that check up every morning, gotta get it if you want it
