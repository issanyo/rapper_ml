[Chorus]
I made a 100 today
Look at my Rollie when I need a date
There's flawless VS's inside of the face
I see the stars inside of the Wraith
I went for the cup but I'm still in LA
Pray to the Lord that I beat my case
I pour up a four and I go outer space
Can't go back and forth, ain't no time to debate
Real nigga shit and you cannot relate
I ain't got no feelings, I don't feel the fakes
I keep a Glock 40 on side of my waist
My plug get that work and it slip out of state
I pop me a perc and now I'm in a daze
I ain't got no pressure and I'm tired of waiting
I bought a big house that's surround with a gate
I moved out the hood, made sure Momma straight

[Verse 1]
I cannot stop, I gotta keep going
I can't go off, I gotta stay on
These niggas fake, these niggas fraud
We at the top and you niggas boring
Got with the slimes and I started touring
Jumped out the jet, went and copped me a foreign
Four Audemars, finna dip it in water
Go to Saks Fifth I might spend me a quarter
We shit on these niggas and shit on these bitches
My loc on Old Nat cut that dope in the kitchen
I'mma rap on my track, I done make a decision
It used to be Green but now we shop at Lennox
The lean on my face just to help with my vision
Handle my part and I play my position
I use my brain and I pay attention
I'mma sit back, chop up that work up like Beni
Ride in the foreign and no it ain't rented
This a freestyle, it's just the beginning
We just be wilding and we ain't got no limit
Money keep piling and I'ma swim in it
I'm going hard like I'm in the 9th inning
Come through in Forgee no shittin' and pissin'
Bitch I'm a shark, I swim with the fishes
I pray to the God, you know I'm committed

[Chorus]
I made a 100 today
Look at my Rollie when I need a date
There's flawless VS's inside of the face
I see the stars inside of the Wraith
I went for the cup but I'm still in LA
Pray to the Lord that I beat my case
I pour up a four and I go outer space
Can't go back and forth, ain't no time to debate
Real nigga shit and you cannot relate
I ain't got no feelings, I don't feel the fakes
I keep a Glock 40 on side of my waist
My plug get that work and it slip out of state
I pop me a perc and now I'm in a daze
I ain't got no pressure and I'm tired of waiting
I bought a big house that's surround with a gate
I moved out the hood, made sure Momma straight

[Verse 2]
I'm still in the streets, cause shit can get deep
I gotta keep Meech, Chanel on my feet
My jewelry ain't cheap, I know I'm a beast
I go get that work, watch my niggas eat
I need some more diamonds, my team need some rings
Put ice in my teeth, man I l feel like a king
Red bottoms on with my YSL jeans
I need that drip when I walk on the scene
Look up at a boss when you talking to me
You know this shit cost I can't walk through for free
I pour up that mud and I roll up, get geeked
I heard he ran off on you niggas, you sleep
I made 45 and I break down a P
I bought the whole house, they didn't give me a lease
Run through the week make a hunnid at least
Copped me a coupe, it ain't come with no key
Bitch I be high and I don't get no sleep
They say I ride when I'm on a beat
I love your vibe let's fuck in the suite
She got her friend fucking on me
The strong gon' survive and these niggas weak
This a freestyle but this shit ain't free
I got crocodile all over my seats
They eat up the style, they get it from me

[Chorus]
I made a 100 today
Look at my Rollie when I need a date
There's flawless VS's inside of the face
I see the stars inside of the Wraith
I went for the cup but I'm still in LA
Pray to the Lord that I beat my case
I pour up a four and I go outer space
Can't go back and forth, ain't no time to debate
Real nigga shit and you cannot relate
I ain't got no feelings, I don't feel the fakes
I keep a Glock 40 on side of my waist
My plug get that work and it slip out of state
I pop me a perc and now I'm in a daze
I ain't got no pressure and I'm tired of waiting
I bought a big house that's surround with a gate
I moved out the hood, made sure Momma straight
