[Intro: Lil Durk]
Yeah
Ayy what Blac Youngsta tell them hoes? (Toot toot)

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
I can't get enough of it, all of this jealousy
I had a petty bitch, you can do better things
Smoke gas, kerosene, three roll, wedding ring
In my DM meddling, off the X, that ecstasy

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Seven hundred for the Vetements
I'm a boss, not a gentleman
All my hoes intelligent
Can't set me up, Tori Brixx
I like my bitches lit
I spend a bag of checks
Ecstasy, Tesla
Amiri jeans fetish
Look at my world, let's get in tune
Look at this lean, addicted to it
While he off the leaf, embalming fluid
Shopping spree, I overdo it, yeah
Stick talk stick talk (Chick chick, bang)
Sneak diss, this stick talk (Chick chick, bang)
Don't talk, just stick talk (Chick chick, bang)
I'm with niggas that stick talk (Brrah)
Go to Europe to get all the euros
Yes sir, designer apparel
Chapo, need to find the heroin
Broke bitch, that vibe'll kill you

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
I can't get enough of it, all of this jealousy
I had a petty bitch, you can do better things
Smoke gas, kerosene, three roll, wedding ring
In my DM meddling, off the X, that ecstasy

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I can't get enough of it (Can't get enough of it)
I shootout in public (I shootout in public)
My soda is bubbly (Soda is bubbly)
My chest and neck watery (Chest and neck watery)
I turned to a better me
The Hellcat got hella speed
She want methamphetamines (Yeah)
Hope you don't never leave (Hope you don't never leave)
I move it like Billy Jean (Like Billy Jean)
A leopard Amiri jeans (Yeah)
D&G but I've been a king (I've been a king)
Family, you can't get between (You can't get between)
Don't you please try to intervene
Gunna dripping by any means (By any means)
Elli-A got my jewelry clean (My jewelry clean)
Got a rose and white wedding ring (White wedding ring)
I married the presidents (The presidents)
I ain't leaving no evidence (No evidence)
Slimy life, I'm not scared of shit (Nah)
Fuck her face let her eat the dick (Let her eat the dick)
Can't deny, that's just what it is (Yeah)
I'ma take care my brother's kids (My brother's kids)
Got it out of a muddy ditch (Yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
Just don't talk to me (Just don't talk to me)
