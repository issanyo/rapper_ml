[Intro: Lil Duke]
Light bitch get out of my way, come on
Yeah, yeah
YSL shit (yeah)
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah!

[Hook: Lil Duke]
First let me light my blunt, then I'ma hit my cup
She made you wait three months, first day she let me fuck
All my young niggas up, doggin these hoes can't get stuck
And I can't love on these hoes I just lust, we used to be broke used to ride on the bus
I'm in the lambo I'm crawlin down sunset and I look like a motherfucking caterpillar
I left a 9 in the spot and it came with a Glock and a motherfucking babysitter
I don't surround myself around none of these broke niggas
All I hang around is some Major niggas
I use to break on the cops and I leave the block hot like some motherfucking Cajun nigga

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
They talkin about us they can't face us niggas
Bitches I dont wanna fuck say they hate a nigga
Play with my money I gotta whole lot of tips for you just like I'ma waiter nigga
Every day my birthday like Yak Gotti
Don't stand in no line I don't do no waiting
I'm geeked up right now and I'm fuckin faded
I thank the lord that we finally made it
Thanking the lord that we here today
He gave me a chance now I'm here to stay
Surrounded by real I dont fuck with fake
If it ain't about no money don't wanna play
Better stay down get yo racks up
Dont play crazy boy you act tough
I'm in pakistan I'm in the bluff
Say you got a hundred thou' boy that ain't shit to us
Hit yo ass with a hundred round come pick 'em up
Shot ole man up back I hope he don't run out of luck
Mane all the bad bitches they wanna fuck they hurt 'em up
Run through the club make it thunderstorm
You never seen this is a one on one
Young nigga they got a ton of guns
Part of them they can't wait to eat some lunch
Then they pulling up in all kind of foreigns
No basic bitch you broke bitches boring

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I use to trap on the block use to trap out the bando and break down the bundles
Back in my momma house told her I ain't moving out till I done stack me a hunnit
Hit me my first lick and I buy me a pint and I went to go cop me a Honda
That shit caught as fried as Mcdonald's, lil bitch get that shit, it weren't funny
The ice on my neck and wrist under my fingers I told you I gone shine like the summer
I need me a bitch like Madonna, eat on that pussy, Kutana
Bake that shit up like lasagna, she say she wanted young Gunna
I'm still on that run up get done up, walk in that club with that burner
All of my niggas don't murder, don't know what you heard of, we came out the ghetto
Came a long way from the Nat now we got us some racks and a spot in Rodeo
Bitch I'mma ball like a layup, I jus wan' fuck and don't lay up
I see niggas old need to pay up, you gon' pay the cost or your day up
