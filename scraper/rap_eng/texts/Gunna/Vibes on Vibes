[Intro: Gunna]
We- we havin' vibes on- vibes on vibes, nigga
(Run that back, Turbo)

[Chorus: Gunna & UnoTheActivist]
Me and Uno and four different hoes (Four different hoes)
She got the head and too many goals
Tesla truck wit’ the suicide doors (Suicide doors)
Can't keep it real, niggas gettin' exposed
We put up this money and let it get old (Let it get old)
I’ma go flood out my neck 'til it's cold
Set a fire when all my niggas is home
Ya dig, yeah, ooh, we just want all the blue hunneds, that's it
I got a bad bitch, she don't want a vet
We need bottle syrup, we just stepped in the V.I.P
No, we don't need bottles, we came wit' the sip
Too many vibes, we try and secure
Too much this money, I give you the word
I call up young Gunna for bags of birds

[Verse 1: Gunna & UnoTheActivist]
I land in L.A. and I stay at the loft
Dressin' in Raf from head to toe
Bags of the mids in from Mexico
I had no witness, this case is closed
Take off the face, then the case is closed
I have the fish and the bread, the whole loaf
We see a lil’ lick, we on top of that
Put dick down the middle, no politics
Put the dick in her mouth and she swallowed it
You lil’ niggas just fake, I'm the opposite
I know that ain’t no drip, won't acknowledge it
I been gaining my power like politics
Don't wanna fuck it unless you stay washin' it
I can’t fuck wit' no bitch, you got germs
My money straight like a perm
Maybachs, his and hers
Got no lessons learned
Wait, no blessin' burned
Told the lil' nigga, "Better wait your turn"
Ay, sit back then watch this, watch how I catch this birdie
Hold my back like girdle
Hard-body, got a lot of water, like Squirtle
Me and young Gunna hop poles like hurdles

[Chorus: Gunna & UnoTheActivist]
Me and Uno and four different hoes (Four different hoes)
She got the head and too many goals
Tesla truck wit' the suicide doors (Suicide doors)
Can't keep it real, niggas gettin' exposed
We put up this money and let it get old (Let it get old)
I'ma go flood out my neck 'til it's cold
Set a fire when all my niggas is home
Ya dig, yeah, ooh, we just want all the blue hunneds, that's it
I got a bad bitch, she don't want a vet
We need bottle syrup, we just stepped in the V.I.P
No, we don't need bottles, we came wit' the sip
Too many vibes, we try and secure
Too much this money, I give you the word
I call up young Gunna for bags of birds

[Verse 2: Gunna & UnoTheActivist]
I'm 'bout to geek up, Jag, and swerve (Jag and swerve)
I used to sell all my gas on the curb
I went and bought her a Birkin purse
She went and bought me a pint of the syrup
Big cup and I'm sippin' on sizzurp
Wit' my slime, my lizard
Baby pop a Perc' and she start to go bezerk
Ooh, this real plat', no silver (Ice)
Come take a look at my ice, mistake me for a blizzard (Ice, ice)
I advise everything twice, don't turn me to a killer
Gunna ain't havin' no wife, you ain't gotta call me mister
I could have spared your wife, I ain't even have to hit her
'Sace all over my bedspread, matchin' wit the cizzurtains
Now we make these hunneds spread, remember we was all hurt
Baby make them legs spread, we gon' cop a purse
Cashin' out on these hoes, we can cop 'em all Birkins

[Chorus: Gunna & UnoTheActivist]
Me and Uno and four different hoes (Four different hoes)
She got the head and too many goals
Tesla truck wit' the suicide doors (Suicide doors)
Can't keep it real, niggas gettin' exposed
We put up this money and let it get old (Let it get old)
I'ma go flood out my neck 'til it's cold
Set a fire when all my niggas is home
Ya dig, yeah, ooh, we just want all the blue hunneds, that's it
I got a bad bitch, she don't want a vet
We need bottle syrup, we just stepped in the V.I.P
No, we don't need bottles, we came wit' the sip
Too many vibes, we try and secure
Too much this money, I give you the word
I call up young Gunna for bags of birds
