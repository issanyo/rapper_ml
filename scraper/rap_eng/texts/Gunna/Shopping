[Chorus]
Peel out the lot in that four door new Masi'
Pull up with that bag and we 'bout to go shopping
Walk inside Sacs and we know that I'm copping
I got some Tom Ford, Dior, and Zanotti
I got twenty whores inside of the lobby
That Rolls a two door, it's still a big body
Treat my niggas like royalty, we not divided
I'll count up some more, make sure that we got it

[Verse 1]
I had to grind and this shit don't come free
Stunk up the whole house when I broke down a P
Got mine out the streets and I brought home a feast
I do it for my fam, I don't just do it for me
When I took a loss, man that made me a beast
The car in your name, but that shit still a lease
They'll let niggas pop but don't pop shit on me
I'll cut your shit top, leave your brains in the seat
No more baby bottles, we pour out the pint
I bust in her mouth, flew her back to the bay
That Wraith make me feel like I'm floating in space
I went to Old Nat now I'm back in LA
I still got that Rolex to keep up the day
Gon' shine on these hoes like the middle of May
We only pour four just to see how it tastes
I got me a K and ain't nobody safe
I'm putting dick in his bitch, so I know why he hate
When he got on the plate, he was already ate
Before that bag was already made
I got me some racks but there's more I can make
Stones in my wrist, put a stone in my face
Treat that bitch like a fish and I give her some bait
Label they calling, they wan' know my rate
Shout out Offset cause bitch I beat the case

[Chorus]
Peel out the lot in that four door new Masi'
Pull up with that bag and we 'bout to go shopping
Walk inside Sacs and we know that I'm copping
I got some Tom Ford, Dior, and Zanotti
I got twenty whores inside of the lobby
That Rolls a two door, it's still a big body
Treat my niggas like royalty, we not divided
I'll count up some more, make sure that we got it

[Verse 2]
Before hit the awards, man I pop me some molly
That shit was so pure, had me itching and rocking
Then poured up some Tech, had me leaning and scratching
And a half of a xan just to help me relax
And I pulled that lil' hoe she was from Calabasas
Don't know her real name but she looked like that action
Took her to the room, we couldn't go to the mansion
And then dropped her off with my locs who on Stanton
Stunting that bitch must've thought she was Kourtney Kardashian
I hit and I run like a muhfucking accident
Pulled up to the spot, don't see nun' but some packages
And I got some Sprite finna mix 'em with Actavis
Po-pour it up, make sure it Act in it
Pull up with that stick shoot it rapidly
Bang yo shit out with the accuracy
Call up a cop it's a emergency
Got some racks and I'm feeding my family
Fuck all you hoes who abandoned me
They slandered my name, tried to damage me
All of that hate brought me currency
I woke niggas up, never heard of me
I heard niggas say they gon' murder me
Pull up with the stick, look like 30 deep
Peel off in that lot in that new GT

[Chorus]
Peel out the lot in that four door new Masi'
Pull up with that bag and we 'bout to go shopping
Walk inside Sacs and we know that I'm copping
I got some Tom Ford, Dior, and Zanotti
I got twenty whores inside of the lobby
That Rolls a two door, it's still a big body
Treat my niggas like royalty, we not divided
I'll count up some more, make sure that we got it
