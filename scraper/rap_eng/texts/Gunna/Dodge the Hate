[Chorus]
I'm goin' outer space
In love with the dead face
I'm steady gainin' weight
I'm just tryna dodge the hate
My future's bright as day
They throwin' all kind of shade
I'm goin' to buy the bank
I'm tryna pave the way

[Verse 1]
Hopped on the interstate
I got me some M's to make
Come from where they kill and take
I learned the hard way
Shoot out in broad day
We takin' all aim
I'm just tryna dodge the hate
I might camoflauge the Wraith
I'm drippin' feng shui
I'm Valentino from my head to my feet
Lean is my bombay
I promise I'm putting Chanel on my niece
Up in the way, you can't reach
Your bitch be takin' the D
New sixty-three, AMG
I'm a little 'head of my speech
I'm in the need for speed
I got this beat from Wheezy
My bitch is easy breezy
It's a new drippin' season
I had to be the reason
Girl what I said I mean it
I'm on the syrup, I'm leanin'
You still tryna follow the leader

[Chorus]
I'm goin' outer space
In love with the dead face
I'm steady gainin' weight
I'm just tryna dodge the hate
My future's bright as day
They throwin' all kind of shade
I'm goin' to buy the bank
I'm tryna pave the way

[Verse 2]
I don't need no leeway
I'm not being clich√©
I don't want your cheesecake
Some shit I don't 'ppreciate
Gettin' robbed with the Glock, ayy
That's my compadre
Just bought a new watch
I walk with a walk
They say that I'm hotter
'cause I came with propane
I'm just tryna maintain
I'm not eating lo mein
I know it's a cold game
I'm still rockin' Balmains
I'm tryna remain sane
Buy platinum and gold chains
I smoke out a whole thing
Pour out the whole pint
The spot white as Colgate
You just missed your ho, you too late
I don't really care what you think
I'm in my own lane
I'm poppin' my own mane
It got me a long way

[Chorus]
I'm goin' outer space
In love with the dead face
I'm steady gainin' weight
I'm just tryna dodge the hate
My future's bright as day
They throwin' all kind of shade
I'm goin' to buy the bank
I'm tryna pave the way
