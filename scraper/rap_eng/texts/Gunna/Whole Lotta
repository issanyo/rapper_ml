[Hook: Lil Duke]
My main focus is to get up, go get it
Make sure my niggas stay with me
And we don't fall like bad bitches
All we care 'bout is our riches
Came from that pot in that kitchen
Play with that money, whole lotta 'bouta be missed
I'm talking whole lotta 'bouta be missed
It's a whole lotta these niggas snitching
So I just stay up out the way and go get it
Got DC White and Gunna Gunna they with it

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
Flew out to LA and I made a million
Sitting at the life, I'm on top and I'm chilling
They paying attention to what I'm fulfilling
I'm tryna stack that shit up 'bout tall as a building
In a Maybach, I'm riding on Crenshaw
'Bout to bust a left, I'm saucing
Then we pull up at [?]
Hopping out, all the hood niggas feel me
She got the good head like she went to Harvard
I buy the diamonds in person, I spoil 'em
Won't lie to you baby, I lie to your honor
I know to be with a real nigga, it must be an honor
I know your car's rented, but I am an owner
You're not on my level, you gon' need a loaner
[?] you know that I boned her
They was geeking, getting real high like Lamar Odom
She said she in love with my style
It's a party at the mansion, girls going wild
You gon' fuck around and have my child
Run that money up, I can't leave my homie down

[Hook: Lil Duke]
My main focus is to get up, go get it
Make sure my niggas stay with me
And we don't fall like bad bitches
All we care 'bout is our riches
Came from that pot in that kitchen
Play with that money, whole lotta 'bouta be missed
I'm talking whole lotta 'bouta be missed
It's a whole lotta these niggas snitching
So I just stay up out the way and go get it
Got DC White and Gunna Gunna they with it

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Don't try to play with me nigga
I ain't gon' play with no nigga
Might pull the K on them nigga
Had to lay on a nigga
I ain't even hated, I mentioned
I hit this block with them hittas
My youngin squeezing them triggers
I'm tryna live and get richer
My life a full motion picture
And with all this ambition
I know this shit can get bigger
It could all be so simple
But the haters gon' end me
I gotta keep me a pistol
Better know this shit in me
The streets as cold as December
So I stay close to the heat
Gotta take them boys to sleep
I'mma go as hard as this beat
Growing up got it all out the streets
A cold heart, I'm a beast
We roll it all out the P
Me and Duke [?]
