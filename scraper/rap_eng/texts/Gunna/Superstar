[Intro: Lil Gotit]
Yeah, uh
From the A to NYC
Yeah, uh
On God, uh
It's crazy but it's true (Let's go)

[Chorus: Lil Gotit]
Superstar status, yeah
All dead presidents
Poppin' seals on pints of red
Superstar status, yeah
They finally gave me a chance (On God)
Hood Baby, they understand
Tell your messenger I'm breakin' bands
On that superstar status, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Gotit]
Drip all day, no ends
They done got me started again
Chinatown, forty tucked, eatin' chicken
Pyrex kit with the bow in the kitchen
Cop some culture when I land in the city
Ain't talkin' dreads when I say extensions
Got to work my way up for the Bentley, hah hah
OG kush, might lose my mind
Fiji water in the Patek, long time
Off top, you droppin' them dimes
Bitch come hop in this ride
Had to put my pride to the side
Young Trap hoppin' on a G5
Bangin' five, no Five Guys
Leave the trappin' out my life
Caught some chills for the two tone
Make the racks then I go home
Keep a steel in the kill zone
Mind your business, you a lil' loan
Never let them make you feel wrong
Ain't got no arms I can lie on
Ain't got no arms I can cry on
All in all, I hold my own

[Chorus: Lil Gotit]
Superstar status, yeah
All dead presidents
Poppin' seals on pints of red
Superstar status, yeah
They finally gave me a chance (On God)
Hood Baby, they understand
Tell your messenger I'm breakin' bands
On that superstar status, yeah

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Superstar status, yeah, uh
Got a cute ratchet, yeah, yeah
Ridin' with a baddie, yeah
I put some pointers in the Patek, yeah
On the flight, I pop xannies, yeah
Double up, nigga, back to back
Get the money, don't panic
Count the cash and rubber band it
Slime, she gon' leave you like candy (Slime)
Young Gunna, I'm a Chanel bandit (Chanel)
Not one of my foreign cars rented (No)
Trunk in the front with an engine (Wild)
Off-White jean look dingy (They dingy)
Bettin' on the bitch, ain't stingy (Racks)
See the stars and you know they Givenchy (Star)
Go to trial and we killin' all the witness (On Gunna)
Gunna still drippin' (Gunna still drippin')
Used to get it out the kitchen (Yeah)
Whip it with a beater (I whip it with a beater)
Uh, Porsche two-seater (Porsche two-seater)
I don't want your feature (Nah, nah)
They listen, I'm the teacher
I'm a superstar creature (Just like Gotit, let's go)

[Chorus: Lil Gotit]
Superstar status, yeah
All dead presidents
Poppin' seals on pints of red
Superstar status, yeah
They finally gave me a chance (On God)
Hood Baby, they understand
Tell your messenger I'm breakin' bands
On that superstar status, yeah
