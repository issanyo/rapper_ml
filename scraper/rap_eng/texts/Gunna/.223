[Chorus: Gunna]
I got flawless baguettes in that side of the charm
Expensive designer, ain't never been worn
Receivin' the prices we sell out the dorm
Sky-dweller watch cover half of my arm
Niggas ain't rockin the shit that we on
Your bitch came to see me like 5 in the morning
We carry these .223s like we the army
Hah, you niggas broke, don't think life is important
And I know we selling out like they Jordanâ€™s
Cashing out numerous thousands at Barneys
You gon' swallow this cum 'fore you have an abortion
All the cars spaceships, we look like the martians
Stay in the box, can't go out of the margin
Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
This is a Bentley bitch, this not a Lexus
You beat me to the club like a domestic
I came to the club and they gave me a section
Hop in my truck and my truck all matte black
Saint Laurent trench coat, Rick Owen my jacket
Pull up I Lamb it, No I won't crash it
Rock star lifestyle like my name Lenny Kravitz
Cartier diamonds, the frame in my glasses
No no no, you can not get these lens crafters
I shook his hand I was smiling and laughing
We killed that nigga, came out like what happened (what happened)
What happened lil nigga, what happened
It's Mr. geeked up, I'm never not laughing
I stay with my twin like my name is Shannon
Blacken my fish, and no pink call it salmon (Yeah!)

[Chorus: Gunna]
I got flawless baguettes in the side of the charm
Expensive designer, ain't ever been worn
Recievin' the package we sell out the dorm
Sky-dweller watch cover half of my arm
Niggas ain't rockin the shit that we on
Your bitch come and see me like 5 in the morning
We carry these .223s like we the army
Hah, you niggas broke, don't think life is important
Headlining, we selling out like the Jordan's
Cashing out New Miri's, thousand at Barneys?
You gon' swallow this cum 'fore you have an abortion
All the cars spaceships we look like the martians
Stay in the box, can't go out of the margin
Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Pussy cool but her head is retarded
Make one false move and your head is a target (target)
Lot of drip and I still ain't rewarded
Still ball with my crew like I play with the Hornets
Rage EDM like my bro DJ Carnage
I can walk in Magic turn the weather to stormy
These four bitches wanna give me an orgy
You hear the horses when we runnin' these Porsche's
Drop the top off it like I get sore
Come see the paint on my Christian Dior
Comin' up really had this shit hard
Now bet you won't see me shoppin' in Zara
Went straight on the white, I got hard
60 whole rounds in that mini-AR
Comin' up some of my dogs caught the yard
Now I got one I got me A&Rs

[Chorus: Gunna]
I got flawless baguettes in that side of the charm
Expensive designer, ain't ever been worn
Recievin' the package we sell out the dorm
Sky-dweller watch cover half of my arm
Niggas ain't rockin the shit that we on
Your bitch come and see me like 5 in the morning
We carry these .223s like we the army
Haa, you niggas broke, don't think life is important
And I know we selling out like the Jordan's
Cashing out new 'Miri's, thousand at Barneys
You gon' swallow this cum 'fore you have an abortion
All the cars spaceships, we look like the martians
Stay in the box, can't go out of the margin
Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it
