[Chorus: Future & Young Thug]
Gave that Philippe to that lil' bitty bitch and I made her a monster (Made her a monster)
I can’t address all the issues I'm dealin' with, I’m goin' bonkers (Goin' brazy)
You not meetin' up to my criteria, I'm not responsive (I'm not responsive)
We done kidnapped your girl on the low and she been goin' bonkers (She goin' brazy)
I had apartments filled up with the work, you can go ask Tonya (Yeah, she gon’ tell you)
I spent 20 G’s just on one purse, I'm gettin’ at that llama (And that's on God)
I came straight from that mothafuckin' dirt, but then I had conquered this (Then I accomplished this)
I'm on that purp like a unicorn after I came from The Dungeon (Woo, yee)

[Verse 1: Future & Young Thug]
We can do yachts or we can do jets whenever we lunchin’ (Yeah, yeah)
We doin' three at a time, no lie, this life is a bungee (Yeah, yeah)
I was damn near out my mind, a nigga wasn't frontin'
I had to go and get on my grind, that broke shit haunt me (Yeah, yeah)
I got 'em comin' in all different kinds, flyin' out the country (Flyin' out the coo')
Fill up a Glock with nothin' but that lead and go get some money (Go get some bread)
When in Jamaica, I was sippin' on red with my Venezuelan ('Zuelan)
I went and jumped in the pool out the bed with some Saudi Arabians (Woo)
I got 'em comin' in fresh out the boat, they lovin' the caterings (Lovin' the woo)
We came up piss poor, I had to Tom Brady it (Had to Tom Brady it)
I got some bags just sittin' out in England but I ain't savin' it (But I'm not savin' it)
She got that Boston, Massachusetts, I'ma Mercedes it (Massachusetts)
She go'n and sellin' it, prostitution, but I ain't hatin' it (But I ain't hatin' it)
I got the models comin' by the fews, I hope you relatin' it (Hope you relate)
After I made her tie my shoes, I made her my favorite (Tie my shoes)
Everything we did exclusive, ain't no way fakin' it (Everything exclusive)
50 million on one play, that's how we be makin' it (50 million)
And I came up out the red clay, it ain't no debatin' it
And I got diamonds in the face, you can feel the a-radiance (Feel the radiance)
And I got some fine shit on the way, I think she Israelian (Ayy, she Dubai, yeah)
Last year, we bought an AK every single day, we did (Every single day, we did)
All this shit, take to your grave, a nigga ain't sayin' shit (Niggas ain't, shhh)
Dot 40 knock down an elephant if he a maniac
We can go squeeze and load out the clip and open one more at that (Open one more cap)

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Gunna]
Millions on millions on millions, I been goin' brazy since came out the dungeon (Yee)
I put the stick in his head and it came out the guts and it came out the stomach
