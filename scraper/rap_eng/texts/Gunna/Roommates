[Chorus: Gunna]
Dubai plates
You got cake
Your drip splash
Hermes H
My coupe fast
Who want race
Drop that bag
Two door wraith
Bachelor pad big ol' gate
All these girls my roomates
Come to the cash I know what it takes (know what it tak`rees)

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Stupid lil' freak talkin' bout wait
Life too short so I can't
Goyard board I'm bout to skate
Keep me a four I sip drank
Beverly center I shop at Saints
Lord I'm a sinner, I ain't a saint
I'm wearin' denim I drip like paint
New paper route I'm at the bank

[Verse 2: Key Glock]
Dirty money I blow stank
Hit this dank watch you faint
I get bags boy you ain't
Hang with gang boy you can't
Bitch I'm paid we not the same
Niggas changin' for some change
Spent the back end on some rain
Spent the back end on a train

[Verse 3: Gunna]
I let her back in
I bought me a range
I made the clip pop
I flew with the gang
Condo in the city condo in L.A
You niggas is opposite we not the same
Really we poppin' we shoot at your brain
You know you can't stop it this shit like a train
We washin' these dollars and makin' 'em clean
Ice on my fingers I'm Lord of the Rings

[Verse 4: Key Glock]
Throw the bananas and all of the [?]
Play with the gang and you know we goin' ape
Play with draco took the side of my Bape
You saving bitches both take off your cape
I fuck your hoe treat that bitch like a slave
Make your hoe turn to a maid
Young nigga and I sip Maid
I can't even [?] made

[Chorus: Gunna]
Dubai plates
You got cake
Your drip splash
Hermes H
My coupe fast
Who want race
Drop that bag
Two door wraith
Bachelor pad big ol' gate
All these girls my roomates
Come to the cash I know what it takes (know what it takes)

[Verse 5: Gunna]
Got new drip
Mr. Porter
I might splash Patek water
Rest on the dash sit there with a spoiler
250 in cash blowin' these quarters
Connect to cartel we crossin' the borders
Ship out the boat gotta move 'em through Florida
She didn't let you fuck cause you couldn't afford her
Niggas get toast and its bread and butter

[Verse 6: Key Glock]
I'm in the gutter with Gunna
We on the block like Mutombo
We get this shit by the bundle
Wrap up that brick by the bundle
I got on ice in the summer
My diamonds bitin' piranha
My niggas slime anaconda

[Chorus: Gunna]
Dubai plates
You got cake
Your drip splash
Hermes H
My coupe fast
Who want race
Drop that bag
Two door wraith
Bachelor pad big ol' gate
All these girls my roomates
Come to the cash I know what it takes (know what it takes)
