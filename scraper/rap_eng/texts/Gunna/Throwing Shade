[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I’m getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain’t throwin' shade
I’m getting money, I ain’t in the way
I stay out the way
Free all my dogs till they get out the cage
I’m having my way
Running through hundreds and millions a day
They know not to play
Yeah I’m the one you can see on my face
A mil in my safe
Everywhere I go I’m keepin' a K
I’m getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain’t throwin' shade
I’m getting money, I ain’t in the way

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
We just been balling like Odell
I got your hoe on my coattail
She in her feeling but oh well
We got em packs from wholesale
Running through thots in the hotel
Give 'em couple of hundreds for toe nails
Only time I'm in crowed, they both tell
They can say it was vacuum sealed with no smell
I was sitting in jail with no bail
I was sitting in prison getting no mail
My nigga switching up on me I don’t care
They got jack shit on him he won't tell
ZO6 Vette, ridin' the fast lane, hope I don't wreck
I'm on that red
Pourin it up with most disrespect
Forgiato on my cars now
I been fuckin 'round with the stars now
5 stars for my lineup
Give these niggas a chance but they time us
Switch the hustle, I did get the grind up
In the spot hundred dollars the lineup
Only big homie niggas can line us
Stickin dick in this bitch cause she fine as fuck

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I’m getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain’t throwin' shade
I’m getting money, I ain’t in the way
I stay out the way
Free all my dogs till they get out the cage
I’m having my way
Running through hundreds and millions a day
They know not to play
Yeah I’m the one you can see on my face
A mil in my safe
Everywhere I go I’m keepin' a K
I’m getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain’t throwin' shade
I’m getting money, I ain’t in the way

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I can't stop the money keep calling
VVS' on my collar
'Caught a body trying to dead dock ya
The way she suck she a head doctor
Diggin in I got her legs lockin
Super trendy got Chanel stockings
I ain't never had to fantasize it
YSL we come and change the climate
Run with twenty thousand one out of Onyx
Swear the ring, the chain, watch, Avianne
I got shooters in the trunk right behind me
I got spots like a cheetah won't find me
Gunna Gunna fell in love with these diamonds
Pressure god only rocking the finest
I done told you the crew is almighty
Several time I just gotta remind you
If you my dog I gotta ride with you
I got you dog on whatever the issue
Free my dogs out of prison I miss you
Fuck the laws and whoever against you
Know the plug I don't go through the middle
Showing love it could all be so simple
I'm a giant remember I used to be little
Getting paid, I don't need no credentials

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I’m getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain’t throwin' shade
I’m getting money, I ain’t in the way
I stay out the way
Free all my dogs till they get out the cage
I’m having my way
Running through hundreds and millions a day
They know not to play
Yeah I’m the one you can see on my face
A mil in my safe
Everywhere I go I’m keepin' a K
I’m getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain’t throwin' shade
I’m getting money, I ain’t in the way
