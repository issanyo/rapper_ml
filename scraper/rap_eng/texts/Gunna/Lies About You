[Chorus: Gunna]
It ain't no facade, I spent some racks on my shoes (Mmh)
I been goin' hard, I paid all cash for my jewels (Cash for my jewels)
I walked in Hermes, bought a bag for my boo (Mmh)
I get them blue hundreds, spread them out like a wound (Out like a wound)
Can't get you off my mind, I might die about you (Die about you)
My outfit cost a dime, can't control how I move (Mmh)
Give praises to the God, don't believe in voodoo (Believe in voodoo)
'Cause when you at the top they'll tell lies about you (Lies about you)

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Tell everything but the truth ('Thing but the truth)
Get nothin' but love from my crew (Love from my crew)
I guess they hate what you do (Hate what you do)
Pull up in coupes with no roofs
You caught me in a good mood (I'm in a good mood)
Can't put a spike in my groove
Got more these designer shoes, mmh (Designer shoes)
I drip, I need an award (Drippin' award)
I whipped that white for that Porsche
I think I'm on a high horse (I'm on a high horse)
YSL, got none' but Hi-Tunes
We kill 'em off, no remorse (Off, no remorse)
I gotta win, I can't lose
I'm tryna feed all my boys (Feed all my boys)
Huh, I paid my dues for these hoes (Yeah)
I got that flame to the torch (Yeah)
Young Gunna ball with no court (Ball with no court)
I hit the trap and quit sports
I give all thanks to the Lord (Thanks to the Lord)
I hit that 'yo and record
They get that drip from your boy, mmh

[Chorus: Gunna & Lil Durk]
It ain't no facade, I spent some racks on my shoes (Mmh)
I been goin' hard, I paid all cash for my jewels (Cash for my jewels)
I walked in Hermes, bought a bag for my boo (Mmh)
I get them blue hundreds, spread them out like a wound (Out like a wound)
Can't get you off my mind, I might die about you (Die about you)
My outfit cost a dime, can't control how I move (Mmh)
Give praises to the God, don't believe in voodoo (Turn up, believe in voodoo)
'Cause when you at the top they'll tell lies about you (Yeah yeah yeah yeah, turn up)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Man bag, guns in 'em (Dope)
Track pants, run in 'em (Shots)
Gorilla glue, Godzilla (Gas)
We don't fuck with no nigga (Pussy)
How you want that Saint Laurent bag, you ain't suckin' no dick? (Ho)
My lil' LA bitch got jet-lag, she off that coke shit (Coke)
Fuck that shit, come on, shawty (Shawty)
Fuck that Ghost, where the Rari? (Skrrt)
None of my niggaswant to party (No)
Them young niggas want to catch a body (Grrah)
We ain't wifing no Chiraq thots (Nah)
Threesome, them my type of thots (Bitch)
Vegas bitch tried to sell me pussy (No no)
Tell that ho like, "Hell no" (No no)
Main homie's bitch tried to fuck me
And she told me he don't know (Don't know)
In fact, they won't say shit
'Cause he know he gon' get peter-rolled (Gang gang)
And we about the violence, my young niggas be wildin' (Turn up)
Your baby mama is trifling (Get 'em), yeah yeah

[Chorus: Gunna]
It ain't no facade, I spent some racks on my shoes (Mmh)
I been goin' hard, I paid all cash for my jewels (Cash for my jewels)
I walked in Hermes, bought a bag for my boo (Mmh)
I get them blue hundreds, spread them out like a wound (Out like a wound)
Can't get you off my mind, I might die about you (Die about you)
My outfit cost a dime, can't control how I move (Mmh)
Give praises to the God, don't believe in voodoo (Believe in voodoo)
'Cause when you at the top they'll tell lies about you (Mmh)
