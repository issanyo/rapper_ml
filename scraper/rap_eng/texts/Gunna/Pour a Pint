[Intro]
Matt, what up?
48 Hertz

[Chorus: Gunna]
Pour a pint, I pour a pint, get my racks out the bank
Tahoe a tank (Tahoe), Dior and Saint (Dior), I drip like a saint
Back from LA, it's cold in the A, put a mink on today
I didn’t come here to play, got my weed from the Bay, and my sneakers from Ye

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Who wanna race? Who wanna race? I falled in a lake
Also not leavin' a trace, your body get traced and dumped in the waste
You all in the way, you followin' the wave, a whole hour on stage
Man, I already made, my bitch is my maid, no minimum wage
My side bitch your ho, I shop in SoHo, I’m out of control
I don't do the most, I barely even post, and I love the West Coast
They pay me to host, they gave me a loaf, I turned it to toast
Backend into notes, I'm stayin' afloat, all white like the Pope
My shades Versace, they think I ain't watchin', I see that you plottin'
Get high like a falcon, with my bitch on my balcony, I'm in love with her body
Blowin’ Gelato, In a new four-door Audi, and the push start is auto
I keep it hollow, got a bitch that gon’ swallow, suck the tip like a hollow

[Chorus: Gunna]
Pour a pint, I pour a pint, get my racks out the bank
Tahoe a tank (Tahoe), Dior and Saint (Dior), I drip like a saint
Back from LA, it's cold in the A, put a mink on today
I didn’t come here to play, got my weed from the Bay, and my sneakers from Ye

[Verse 2: Strick]
Wave Runners, I done caught a wave (Yeah), caught a wave
See me now, niggas got astonished faces, astonished faces
Spendin', can't take hundreds to the grave, to the grave
Me and my partner done dodged a hundred cases, hundred cases
Yeah, Rolex shine like sunrise, Presidential campaign
Tell the Feds to free the guys, kush came in the fast lane
Slimes like some alligators, YSL my charm glacier
Tell 'em pour that up, saw the future like a palm reader

[Chorus: Gunna]
Pour a pint, I pour a pint, get my racks out the bank
Tahoe a tank (Tahoe), Dior and Saint (Dior), I drip like a saint
Back from LA, it’s cold in the A, put a mink on today
I didn't come here to play, got my weed from the Bay, and my sneakers from Ye
