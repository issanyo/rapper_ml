[Intro]
Memphis got the money, babes
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
I popped a bean and I gave my bitch a Xanny (a Xanny)
I pour up clean out the pint and I don't measure (I don't measure)
I up that thing on your clique, might cause a hazard (cause a hazard)
I'm from the old school cut, let's put on [?]
Remember high school, nigga I was drippin' in Palace (I was drippin' in Palace)
Now we on private jets, I turned my residence to Cali' (residence to Cali', yeah)
In the YSL family, first we established (we established, whoa)
Pocket filled with green, nigga that cabbage (racks, racks)

[Verse 1]
I need these my size (these my size)
With this drip, bitch better catch me outside (bitch better catch me outside)
I only want Forgiato rims when I ride (when I ride, yeah)
And a fully loaded FN on my side (it's on my side, bitch)
I know my bro won't lose his hope 'fore I free him out the chain gang (chain gang)
I run with locs, they can get it for the low, these young niggas gang bang (these young niggas gang bang)
All a real street nigga wanna do is stack it up and maintain (stack it up and maintain)
Then jump out 'Rari on these bitches, letting these chains swang (letting these chains swang)
Got some VVS's these ain't VS1 (these ain't VS1)
Brand new Balmain boots, nigga don't get stepped on (nigga don't get stepped on)
Got yo main bitch with me holding my left arm (she holding my left arm, cuh)
And they wanted me to stop, muhfucker I kept going (nigga, I kept going)
Bitch thought she was my girl, had to pass her like Brett Favre (pass her like Brett Favre)
Bought a brand new G5, taking off like NASA (like NASA)
Wild lil' beast better move on the street like a Jaguar (like a Jaguar)
And she'll stress 'till I eat that fish like Alaska

[Chorus]
I popped a bean and I gave my bitch a Xanny (bitch a Xanny)
I pour up clean out the pint and I don't measure (I don't measure)
I up that thing on your clique, might cause a hazard (might cause a hazard)
I'm from the old school cut, let's put on [?]
Remember high school, nigga I was drippin' in Palace (I was drippin' in Palace)
Now we on private jets, I turned my residence to Cali' (residence to Cali', yeah)
In the YSL family, first we established (we established, whoa)
Pocket filled with green, nigga that cabbage (that cabbage)

[Verse 2]
I can't tell no lies (I can't tell no lie)
On the private island where we reside (yeah, we reside)
I don't need no stylist with the shit I buy (with the shit I buy)
I put that shit on, then light it on fire (light it on fire)
I feel like Al Capone, play with me you die (yeah, yeah)
Shit clique type, connect this shit to the ties (yeah, connect this shit to the tie)
New wristwatch, iced my shit 'fore I strive (yeah, nigga, ice my shit 'fore I strive)
It came with all lies
Protect my pride (protect my pride)

[Chorus]
I popped a bean and I gave my bitch a Xanny (bitch a Xanny)
