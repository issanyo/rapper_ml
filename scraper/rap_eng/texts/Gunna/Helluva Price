[Intro]
If young Metro don't trust you, I'ma shoot you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
Tryna give you more life (tryna give you more life)
I can see through the Sprite (I can see through the Sprite)
Niggas creepin' like mice (creepin' like mice)
I'ma speak through the mic (I'ma speak through the mic)
You gotta be more precise (you gotta be more precise)
You ain't wrong if you right (you ain't wrong if you right)
Had a wonderful night (had a wonderful night)
Paid a hell of a price (paid a hell of a price)
Paid a hell of a price

[Verse 1]
Hopped on a jet, you can't delay the flight
One of the best, ride the beat like a bike
Don't press your tone when you niggas drive by
The stick is so extend, niggas shootin' on sight
I blow through a twenty but that shit was light
When they cut that check, man I gotta do right
Buy up a mansion so wet it was ice
Gonna get everything that I desire
This not a freestyle 'cause this shit in my brain
Prepare for a loss 'cause this shit come with pain
Some niggas fell off and just started getting paid
Made me a boss, now I hold my own weight
I'm practicing patience, don't know how to wait
Some people just trying, don't got what it take
I talked to the God, he don't make no mistakes
They call me Young Gunna, I might change the game
They call me Young Gunna, I might change the game
Hop in the picture, I might need a frame
I'm tryna free my cuz out the chain gang
I'ma come in and go out with a bang
I'ma come in and go out with a bang
I'ma come in and go out with a bang
Used to be trapping and ducking these raids
Now we count up and get booked for a stage
Now we count up and get booked for a stage
I feel like Uzi, I love her with rage
Ride around town in that Bentley Mulsanne
I wanna shit on my exes today
I wanna shit on my exes today
Spend up them racks and then look at they face
This came from Metro, this shit ain't from Zay
He came to let the beast out of the cage

[Chorus]
Tryna give you more life (tryna give you more life)
I can see through the Sprite (I can see through the Sprite)
Niggas creepin' like mice (creepin' like mice)
I'ma speak through the mic (I'ma speak through the mic)
You gotta be more precise (you gotta be more precise)
You ain't wrong if you right (you ain't wrong if you right)
Had a wonderful night (had a wonderful night)
Paid a hell of a price (paid a hell of a price)
Paid a hell of a price

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm a trained killer, copped a new Benz Sprinter
Gunna got his own rhythm, big drip like Godzilla
Glock forty, I'm a hot spitter
Send a nigga to the hospital
Told the crowd make a moshpit
Diamonds water, nigga I'm swimming
I'm the one, yeah I did it
I'm the one that got the car kitted
I been poppin' like a hot skillet
I been rockin' customized shit
I been geeking, man I'm high as a bitch
I be fucking on the Roxy
You lil niggas tryna copy
You just make a nigga cocky

[Chorus]
Tryna give you more life (tryna give you more life)
I can see through the Sprite (I can see through the Sprite)
Niggas creepin' like mice (creepin' like mice)
I'ma speak through the mic (I'ma speak through the mic)
You gotta be more precise (you gotta be more precise)
You ain't wrong if you right (you ain't wrong if you right)
Had a wonderful night (had a wonderful night)
Paid a hell of a price (paid a hell of a price)
Paid a hell of a price
