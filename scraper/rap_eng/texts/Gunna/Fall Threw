Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Future]
Wheezy outta here (Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus: Rich the Kid & Young Thug]
I got me some twins, identical (What)
I cannot crash the Bentley coupe (Skrrt)
I count up the racks, it's nothing new
The pussy on drip, tell her "Fall through" (Fall through)
Pinky ring, that's a igloo (Igloo)
Stack the racks, the money tall as you
Count a 100 but it's nothing new
Pussy on drip, tell her "Fall threw"
I'm fuckin' this bitch on the bed (On God)
I told her "Proceed with the head" (On God)
I'm countin' these racks on these feds (On God)
I'm puttin' my shit on her legs (On God)
I told the lil' bitch "It's the kid" (The kid)
I told the lil' bitch "I'm the best" (Yeah)
I came with a 9 and a dick (A 9)
I'm keeping a photo with the bitch (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I'm fuckin' with Rich 'cause I'm rich (Ooh)
I told her "I'm keepin' it rich" (Ooh)
Yeah, bitch, I cannot
I fucked you 'cause you a lil' thot, thot
I came with two 9's like I'm ridin' though
Then I hit the 9 with the jackpot
Yeah, I got the crockpot
Yeah, I'm smokin' like magma

[Chorus: Rich the Kid & Young Thug]
I got me some twins, identical (What)
I cannot crash the Bentley coupe (Skrrt)
I count up the racks, it's nothing new
The pussy on drip, tell her "Fall through" (Fall through)
Pinky ring, that's a igloo (Igloo)
Stack the racks, the money tall as you
Count a 100, but it's nothing new
Pussy on drip, tell her "Fall threw"
I'm fuckin' this bitch on the bed (On God)
I told her "Proceed with the head" (On God)
I'm countin' these racks on these feds (On God)
I'm puttin' my shit on her legs (On God)
I told the lil' bitch "It's the kid" (The kid)
I told the lil' bitch "I'm the best" (Yeah)
I came with a 9 and a dick (A 9)
I'm keeping a photo with the bitch (Yeah, huh)

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
Pull up in this Lambo quick (Skrrt)
With the racks, I'm takin' this bitch (What?)
Quarter million my neck, lil' sis
Say your bitch is the...
