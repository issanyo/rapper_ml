[Chorus: Offset]
I beat the case, all this cash that I make (racks)
Pull up in Wraiths, had to chop off the main (uh)
Pull up in them horses (whoo), two million endorsements (mil)
Tryna get on some Forbes shit (forbe)
Wave the flag it's a forfeit
Money come 'round like a orbit (hey)
Evaporation, I absorb it (come on)
Lambo green it's a tortoise
Eat the molly 'til I'm nauseous
Surround myself with the bosses (boss)
Cause they done had it and they lost it (lost it)
These diamonds hittin' on me darling
I fucked your bitch and it ain't cost me (smash)

[Verse 1: Offset]
I fucked your hoe and it ain't cost me (smash, smash)
My diamonds green, not from Boston (my diamonds green, whoo!)
He talking mean so I offed him (talking mean, brrr, brrr)
You wasn't loyal so you lost me (hey!)
Deliver my diamonds I ordered these
I kick the bitch out, she recorded me (bye)
I double back cause he had shorted me (huh)
You niggas is soft like velour to me (soft)
Stack it, stack it, stack it up (stack it up)
A whole 'nother bracket, I leveled up (bracket)
All of the gang, got bezeled up (bezel)
Stay in your lane you don't make enough (skrrt)
Parked the Benz on the side (skrrt)
My ex-bitch got 5 (ex)
Frog eyes, mob ties (frog)
She choosing on me, all live (hey!)
All lives, black pride (pride)
Lambo doors open wide (ay!)
Sipping Actavis, I nodd (act)
Cocaine still alive (coke)

[Chorus: Offset]
I beat the case (hey), all this cash that I make (racks)
Pull up in Wraiths, had to chop off the main (uh)
Pull up in them horses (whoo), two million endorsements (mil)
Tryna get on some Forbes shit (Forbe)
Wave the flag it's a forfeit
Money come 'round like a orbit (hey)
Evaporation, I absorb it (come on)
Lambo green it's a tortoise
Eat the molly 'til I'm nauseous
Surround myself with the bosses (boss)
Cause they done had it and they lost it (lost it)
These diamonds hittin' on me darling
I fucked your bitch and it ain't cost me (smash)

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I fucked the bitch she can't stop callin'
I fix my chain, I pop my collar
I take out flights out to the pilot (I talk to the pilot when I'm on a flight)
I walk in the bank and deposit (yeah)
I came off a PJ from overseas (from overseas)
I'm fucking that bitch from the Philippines (Philippines)
Don't try to look you can't ordered these (order these)
I put some nut on her double d's (double d's)
My shirt got a snake it by double G (Gucci)
I see it, I buy if I want it (I want it)
Got VVS mixed with the pointers
That [?] on that whip ain't no loner
I just put a AK on my shoulder (a AK)
Just got a new spot for the soldiers (soldiers)
Cop that new Bentley truck, fuck the Rover
I'ma thumb through the check 'til it's over ('til it's over)
The 'F' stand for full, I can't see a E (see a E)
Still can pull up and cop a P (cop a P)
The police ain't shit they can't stop a G (can't stop a G)
Dropped a 100k when they indicted me (yeah)

[Chorus: Offset]
I beat the case (hey), all this cash that I make (racks)
Pull up in Wraiths, had to chop off the main (uh)
Pull up in them horses (whoo), two million endorsements (mil)
Tryna get on some Forbes shit (forbe)
Wave the flag it's a forfeit
Money come 'round like a orbit (hey)
Evaporation, I absorb it (come on)
Lambo green it's a tortoise
Eat the molly 'til I'm nauseous
Surround myself with the bosses (boss)
Cause they done had it and they lost it (lost it)
These diamonds hittin' on me darling
I fucked your bitch and it ain't cost me (smash)
