[Intro: Yung Mal]
All this
Gunna
Hmm, real
Molly working, all this money got me nervous
Huh, what

[Chorus: Yung Mal]
All this, molly working, all this money got me nervous
All these foreigns with the curtain, double park 'em right on curbs
All this, pimp purple got me geeked up like I'm Urkel
All this mud in my cup, bitch I pour that shit on purpose
All this, molly working, all this money got me nervous
All these foreigns with the curtain, bitch don't try me like a worker
All this damn purple got me goin' around in circles
All this mud in my cup, bitch I pour that shit on purpose, all this

[Verse 1: Gunna]
All this cheese, must be cottage
VVS chain, hang on my wallet
All these hoes, must be a party
Dripping clothes, my drip exotic
All of this syrup having me naseous
Nigga want raw, let's be logic
All of these sticks, better be catious
Got to get rich, I went and got it
Rev the G8, I want a Masi
Picking these dates, all of it's profit
Gaining more weight, pockets is sloppy
They can't relate, still try to copy
Nigga embrace, Gunna be modest
Bitch buy the Wraith, go 'head and ride it
All this heat, Gunna the hottest, uh

[Chorus: Yung Mal]
Molly working, all this money got me nervous
All these foreigns with the curtain, double park 'em right on curbs
All this, pimp purple got me geeked up like I'm Urkel
All this mud in my cup, bitch I pour that shit on purpose
All this, molly working, all this money got me nervous
All these foreigns with the curtain, bitch don't try me like a worker
All this damn purple got me goin' around in circles
All this mud in my cup, bitch I pour that shit on purpose, all this

[Verse 2: Lil Quill]
All this mud, I'm pourin' this shit up on purpose
All of this bud, I jump in the truck up to serve it
No uppercuts, or we gonna pull up with them shooters and thugs
And they gon' take off with your money
I had to run this shit up, and I had to do this shit urgent
He gon' pull up with the steel with the drum like the purges
If you not having no bag, then that mean that you are not working
I'm just not goin' out sad, you selling pussy for purchase
I'm going bad, high off of kush I was swerving
Ain't nothing but tags, I just bought my lil bitch a Birkin
When we go in Saks, we don't fuck around like a virgin
Don't care what it cost, we is gon' spend it, no we is not limited
Don't care 'bout that call that you sending your young niggas here
Don't care 'bout this bitch that I'm with 'cause I know she be flirtin'
All this, fuckin' cash, I got rubber bands

[Chorus: Yung Mal]
Molly working, all this money got me nervous
All these foreigns with the curtain, double park 'em right on curbs
All this, pimp purple got me geeked up like I'm Urkel
All this mud in my cup, bitch I pour that shit on purpose
All this, molly working, all this money got me nervous
All these foreigns with the curtain, bitch don't try me like a worker
All this damn purple got me goin' around in circles
All this mud in my cup, bitch I pour that shit on purpose, all this
