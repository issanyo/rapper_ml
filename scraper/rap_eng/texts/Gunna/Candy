[Intro]
Wheezy Beatz

[Chorus: Millie Go Lighty]
I've been getting merry
I'm double-cupping up the Henny
Surfing on that good vibe
All I catch is lit times

[Verse 1: Millie Go Lighty]
We've been playing rap lyrics 'til the late night
He got a rhythm that I'm giving at a stage time
He come through, watch me work at state side
We be hoppin' through the hills on a break time
Bumpin' Birds In The Trap in the late night
We driving through how we do, and it's daylight
He come through, watch me work at state side
We be riding on the wave of a dark vibe

[Chorus: Millie Go Lighty & Gunna]
I've been tasting candy
I'm sippin' lean, I'm poppin' xannies
Driving through the late night
All I catch is lit times
Ooooh!

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I been on a Leer, I just landed
Sitting on these racks, they can't stand me
Gunna still can make that work vanish
Phillip's on my fingers, I can't panic
My baby having beauty like a pageant
I been tryna get inside her panties
I ran this shit up with no advances
Activis and tuss and lot's of candy
Me and Millie worth a couple damn millies
And we take a book and we gon' tour around the town
YSL done came with a whole 'nother sound
I can feel the love, so I gotta hold it down
They been going up and my family proud
Swimming in two cups, Lord I hope don't drown
Take another xan, I be living in the clouds
Lean taste like candy in my mouth

[Chorus: Millie Go Lighty]
I've been tasting candy
I'm sippin' lean, I'm poppin' xannies
Driving through the late night
All I catch is lit times

[Empty Instrumental]

[Hook: Millie Go Lighty]
I've been tasting candy
I'm sippin' lean, I'm poppin' xannies
Driving through the late night
All I catch is lit times
