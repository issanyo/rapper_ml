[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I got them new hundreds (New hundreds)

But I ain't crippin' (I ain't crippin', nigga)
Five thousand dollar outfit, bitch, I'm drippin' (Drippin')
Trap nigga, I put a bed in my kitchen (Jugg)
I keep them sticks around me, I ain't slippin'

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I got stoves in the room but I got beds in the kitchen
I'm charging twenty thousand flat for a remixed chicken
Just like Infamous and Future, all my fingers be itchin'
For that motherfuckin' money, I'm a Zone 6 nigga
I'm a Zone 6 hitter, I'm a Zone 6 trap star
Whip the Aston like Nascar, I'm a Zone 6 rap star
Bust them pack, bust them pack, wrap it in saran wrap
Pip, that's my right hand, we bust down the same sack
Wrap that money in saran wrap, fuck them rubber bands
Nigga, I done been in more trouble than Trouble Man
All that jugg and finesse, didn't work, discovered them
Black Amigo, Young Scooter, the streets in love with him

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I got them new hundreds (New hundreds)
I got them new hundreds (New hundreds)
I got them new hundreds (Yeah)
Them old ones in the safe (Count up)
I got them new hundreds (Jugg)
I got them new hundreds (Yeah)
I got them new hundreds
Them old ones in the safe (Count up)
I got them blue hundreds (Blue hundreds)
But I ain't crippin' (I ain't crippin', nigga)
Five thousand dollar outfit, bitch, I'm drippin' (Drippin')
Trap nigga, I put a bed in my kitchen (Jugg)
I keep them sticks around me, I ain't slippin'

[Verse 2: Yung Bans]
Ayy, dripset, dripset, leave a fuck nigga wet (Ayy)
Broke ass nigga penny pinchin', he ain't gettin' no check (Ayy)
Check, check, check, count it up until my fingers hurt
Get this shit straight out the dirt, she hide the Glock in her purse
Nigga, what's your net worth? Nigga, what's your net worth?
All that ice around my neck, a broke bitch better flirt
Have my young nigga eat your face for nothin', put that on a bird
Put a bed in the trap, wake up, we gon' get to work

[Chorus: Young Scooter & Gunna]
I got them new hundreds (New hundreds)
I got them new hundreds (New hundreds)

Them old ones in the safe (Count up)

Them old ones in the safe (Count up)
I got them blue hundreds (Blue hundreds)
But I ain't crippin' (I ain't crippin', nigga)
Five thousand dollar outfit, bitch, I'm drippin' (Drippin')
Trap nigga, I put a bed in my kitchen (Jugg)
I keep them sticks around me, I ain't slippin' (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Gunna]
Spent seventy-five hundred for a coat, I'm expensive (I'm expensive)

Got an Audemar plain jane (Audemar plain jane)
Get money my last name (My last name)

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
