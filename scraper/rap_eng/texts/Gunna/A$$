[Chorus]
Baby got ass in them jeans
Baby got ass in them jeans
Lemme see you bounce, like a trampoline
Dickin' you down, grabbing your weave
And I got some racks, pocket full of green
VVS set, cost me a [?]

[Verse 1]
Pull up in a droptop looking all clean
And I got on Off-White looking like cream
She say she wanna fuck and suck me with no strings
Leaning on the X tryna balance it with weed
Think about flying to Belize
Take a nigga bitch and I let her fly with me
But I will never ever ever let her get between
Mob ties
New lights on the Benz looking cock eyed
On the southside
In the coupe sippin' lean, eating Popeyes
Got a Glock
Young nigga MOB had to pop off
Shit'll get hostile
Make a nigga her star
Any given time and
Rolls Rolex not the Timex
She living like an omelette
Word on the street nigga I'm next
Whip it like a Pyrex
I can take a lot of jets
Fuck a hoe, we gon' have a lot of sex
We gon' count a lot of checks

[Chorus]
Baby got ass in them jeans
Baby got ass in them jeans
Lemme see you bounce, like a trampoline
Dickin' you down, grabbing your weave
And I got some racks, pocket full of green
VVS set, cost me a [?]
Baby got ass in them jeans
Baby got ass in them jeans
Lemme see you bounce, like a trampoline
Dickin' you down, grabbing your weave
And I got some racks, pocket full of green
VVS set, cost me a [?]

[Verse 2]
Now the big booty bitch sucking my soul
Still rocking Off-White, Mr. VLone
Freaky lil' bitch tryna follow me home
Told the lil foe I could smell his cologne
I was just smoking me a zone
Got on all gold but I'mma tote me some chrome
And a hunnid racks on a show now we on
Huncho!
New 2020 Benz need it pronto
With a thick hoe
We in NYC smoking Fonto
Gotta deep throat
Make a nigga run in the Chanel store
I let her bring her friend over
We go and fuck the gun store
I gotta keep a Latex
Fuckin' on a thot having safe sex
A nigga never play that
Running up and down counting paychecks
Racks I'mma make that
I made it out the projects
Poppin' that nigga, never had shit
Now a nigga fly jets

[Chorus]
Baby got ass in them jeans
Baby got ass in them jeans
Lemme see you bounce, like a trampoline
Dickin' you down, grabbing your weave
And I got some racks, pocket full of green
VVS set, cost me a [?]
Baby got ass in them jeans
Baby got ass in them jeans
Lemme see you bounce, like a trampoline
Dickin' you down, grabbing your weave
And I got some racks, pocket full of green
VVS set, cost me a [?]
