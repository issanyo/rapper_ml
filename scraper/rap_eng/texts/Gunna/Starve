[Intro]
Wheezy beats

[Chorus: Lil Duke & Gunna]
Every day I wake up I take out some time to thank the Lord
Niggas hating every day and I just sit back and play my cards
You know that money over bitches, I can't go out 'bout no broad
Keep a bad bitch with me, she look like a Barbie doll
I bought her a push-start, she been with me from the start
Flawless cut stones, man I shine like a star
I got a couple racks on, let it fuck up the mob
Bet that dick break her walls
We gotta have it all

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
You don't gotta work and don't gotta starve
When you with me you see nothing but stars
He treats you like nothing, treats you like a dog
When she mad at you, come lick on my ball
She don't wanna see me leave when I go touring
And I be giving her D every time she get horny
She don't want no one but me, but she ride on my dick like I ride on this beat
That pussy get wet and she know I get money, I put that bih right on her feet
When she keep telling me, "daddy go deep"
I just wanna see my family eat
Came from the jungle, it made me a beast
Play with me, I make them murders increase
And I be sharp as a crease
I got a bitch, she from Greece
And she be begging me please
She know my jewelry on freeze
I'm 'bout to go overseas
All of these bitches at ease
Fucking they daughters and nieces
Thanking the Lord when I get on my knees

[Chorus: Lil Duke & Gunna]
Every day I wake up I take out some time to thank the Lord
Niggas hating every day and I just sit back and play my cards
You know that money over bitches, I can't go out 'bout no broad
Keep a bad bitch with me, she look like a Barbie doll
I bought her a push-start, she been with me from the start
Flawless cut stones, man I shine like a star
I got a couple racks on, let it fuck up the mob
Bet that dick break her walls
We gotta have it all

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I want it all, that's on everything
VVS flawless on every chain
You say you a boss nigga bet it back
I still got some locs that'll let it bang
They give me them M's I won't let up
You put that hoe on a pedestal
Fuck that hoe, leave her lone, what you better do
Be stiff on yo hoe with a attitude
I get dressing, stay sharp like a razor
Bought some Balmain, then had to get Taylor
I swear real life, this shit is not made up
Took my bitch on a trip to Barbados
Got on Tom Ford's, I can't see you haters
Got a Glock with a beam and a lazer
These bitches I fuck gon' be major
But I keep that under the radar

[Chorus: Lil Duke & Gunna]
Every day I wake up I take out some time to thank the Lord
Niggas hating every day and I just sit back and play my cards
You know that money over bitches, I can't go out 'bout no broad
Keep a bad bitch with me, she look like a Barbie doll
I bought her a push-start, she been with me from the start
Flawless cut stones, man I shine like a star
I got a couple racks on, let it fuck up the mob
Bet that dick break her walls
We gotta have it all
