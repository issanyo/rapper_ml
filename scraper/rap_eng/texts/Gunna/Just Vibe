[Intro]
Danny I see you

[Chorus: Gunna & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I dig her vibe, stickin' this dick in her side
She ain't got no ass but got thighs, hop in the coupe and let's ride
I put Chanel on her eyes, two karat ring for surprise
Maybach black seat that recline, roll up some cookie, get high
Kickin' in, now I'm feelin' your vibes
Yeah, I wanna dig in her thighs
She fuck with a winner, that pussy a prize
We shoppin', everything she want, I'm buyin'
Damn girl you fine
She look like she walk down the runway
I need a runway, we be flyin'
Take a vacation with bad bitches
Ain't no relationship, we just vibe

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I can get what I want and I want you
We got the vibes when we come through
I got karats and lettuce like vegetables
Stick it in her mouth like it was edible
Summertime come, I'ma cut off the roof
Put hundreds on the pillow like she lost a tooth
Double C on my shoe, that cost a deuce
Yeah, turn your ho into a massuese
I got rich, I came up from the poverty
Different color gold like neopolitian
She got an ass like she half hippopotamus
Spendin' money, I got a whole lot of it
Two bad bitches right on the side of me
I ain't a player, she said that you gotta be
She ride me, I lay her down like a robbery
I run my money up, is you proud of me?

[Chorus: Gunna & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I dig her vibe, stickin' this dick in her side
She ain't got no ass but got thighs, hop in the coupe and let's ride
I put Chanel on her eyes, two karat ring for surprise
Maybach black seat that recline, roll up some cookie, get high
Kickin' in, now I'm feelin' your vibes
Yeah, I wanna dig in her thighs
She fuck with a winner, that pussy a prize
We shoppin', everything she want, I'm buyin'
Damn girl you fine
She look like she walk down the runway
I need a runway, we be flyin'
Take a vacation with bad bitches
Ain't no relationship, we just vibe

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Fuck a bitch every day, I don't get tired
Racks and I might throw some dirt in her eye
Amiri jeans helped me find me size
Drip or drown nigga, I hope you don't die
In the city and I'm still havin' vibes
My bitch is a mistress, I don't want a wife
If it's for pussy, I don't wanna buy it
Left the kid at the coupe, bae I just wanna slide
Ice in the face so it's hard to tell time
Instead of just hoes I been callin' 'em vibes
They came to the Gunna, wake up to massage
She blowin' up my phone, this bitch harder to dodge
Got her pregnant, had to buy her a Dodge
Rent a million, this is not a facade
I stick it in like I charge an iPod
Dick in her butt, fuck her in the garage

[Chorus: Gunna & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I dig her vibe, stickin' this dick in her side
She ain't got no ass but got thighs, hop in the coupe and let's ride
I put Chanel on her eyes, two karat ring for surprise
Maybach black seat that recline, roll up some cookie, get high
Kickin' in, now I'm feelin' your vibes
Yeah, I wanna dig in her thighs
She fuck with a winner, that pussy a prize
We shoppin', everything she want, I'm buyin'
Damn girl you fine
She look like she walk down the runway
I need a runway, we be flyin'
Take a vacation with bad bitches
Ain't no relationship, we just vibe
