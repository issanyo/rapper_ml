[Intro]
I remember somebody once told me
"I ain't shit without my home boys"
Funny thing is, they was right

[Chorus]
My slime is my slime (Slime, slime)
Keep that rocket with him
Rondo number nine (Nine, nine)
Hope you buster niggas never cross the line (Don't cross the line)
'Cause he gon' gun you down
And then go do the time (Bow, bow, bow)
My slime is my slatt
He don't never leave the house without that bat
Finessed a nigga out his work and threw the jack
My slime, my slime, so you know I got his back (I got his back) Blap, blap, take that, yeah

[Verse 1]
Two coupes (See this coupe)
No roof (No roof)
Ace and Mitch, on my gettin' money shit
If you seen me back to back
You know who I'm rollin' with
He got 30, I got 30
Rollin' 60 like a Crip
That's my word, I got sauce so
You know I like the drip
Hate when niggas hatin' on me
So you know we keep the stick
Call the plug for some bricks
We went half up on that lick
He ain't worried 'bout these hoes
We ain't beefed over no bitch
That's my slime, that's my nigga
Who gon' watch over my kids?
Beat my daughter's boyfriend up?
Raise my son like it was his?
That's my nigga, he the realest
We at Gucci, bustin' swipes
If he bustin', then I'm bustin'
Bitch, I know it's slime for life

[Chorus]
My slime is my slime (Slime, slime)
Keep that rocket with him
Rondo number nine (Nine, nine)
Hope you buster niggas never cross the line (Don't cross the line)
'Cause he gon' gun you down
And then go do the time (Bow, bow, bow)
My slime is my slatt
He don't never leave the house without that bat
Finessed a nigga out his work and threw the jack
My slime, my slime, so you know I got his back (I got his back) Blap, blap, take that, yeah

[Verse 2]
My slime is my slime
He said, "Trip, load the clip, it's time to ride"
Chanel on my hip, pardon my drip; we just slide
Momma say snake, slime life is in his eyes
Look at my set, me and my slatt spend a dime
Business is straight, but I'm a snake in his mind
Too many whips parked outside; I can't decide
Hunnids on me in my jeans, they got us high
All of the Cs, all of them Bs, they ready to slide
Keep that blick, blick, too many homicides
Got icy wrists, figure skate and glide
Color blind niggas, stay up out my sight

[Chorus]
My slime is my slime (Slime, slime)
Keep that rocket with him
Rondo number nine (Nine, nine)
Hope you buster niggas never cross the line (Don't cross the line)
'Cause he gon' gun you down
And then go do the time (Bow, bow, bow)
My slime is my slatt
He don't never leave the house without that bat
Finessed a nigga out his work and threw the jack
My slime, my slime, so you know I got his back (I got his back) Blap, blap, take that, yeah
