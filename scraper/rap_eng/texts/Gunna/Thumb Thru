[Chorus: Gunna]
Thumb through that cash, count up it fast, I look for a bag and go get it
Hundreds of bags of gas, the OG abusive, the pack lemon cookie
Two hundred my dash, I drown like a drag, might fuck 'round and crash on that bullshit
Suck on that dick with the lipstick, I fuck on that ho, make a movie
Fuck on that ho, she a groupie
Let her ride in that foreign and lose it
She a new ho, I recruit it
Heard she used to fuck with the bro Uzi
Told her bend over and toot it
I wanna fuck so let's do it
It didn't take us long to get to it
And they grey hat came off 'fore she blew it

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
Thumb through that shit in a minute
Rich nigga, don't need no denist
Took a lil ho out to Beni's
Ballin', that's in my religion
Money over bitches, that's how we livin'
Automatic gun when we on a mission
Go at they ass and we comin' out winnin'
Came out the mud, came a long way from Disney
Since a young nigga I been had that vision
Took a long time but I knew I'd get millions
Young nigga they got that heart like gorillas
You gonna die if you play with that scrilla
Thumb through that cash, thumb through that cash, all of my niggas go get it
Tryna turn ten to a fifty, don't need no counter 'cause I wanna feel it

[Chorus: Gunna]
Thumb through that cash, count up it fast, I look for a bag and go get it
Hundreds of bags of gas, the OG abusive, the pack lemon cookie
Two hundred my dash, I drown like a drag, might fuck 'round and crash on that bullshit
Suck on that dick with the lipstick, I fuck on that ho, make a movie
Fuck on that ho, she a groupie
Let her ride in that foreign and lose it
She a new ho, I recruit it
Heard she used to fuck with the bro Uzi
Told her bend over and toot it
I wanna fuck so let's do it
It didn't take us long to get to it
And they grey hat came off 'fore she blew it

[Verse 2: Shad da God]
Bubble gum kush, you can't chew it
Smokin' in the back like a 'Wood
That lemonade, it good
Yes I pour that bitch out with that fluid
I'm on that pink chat, that mud
Two two three, proficiently tucked
Time on them streets like time on the thug
A1, came up on the plug
Told that, told that bitch hope these Margielas feel like rugs
Saw the gang, he was extra saucy, wrist out the tub, ayy
Bankroll on [?] way, when we leave it's dark
Got a big coupe on a Wednesday, I pulled out the club, I'm tryna

[Chorus: Gunna]
Thumb through that cash, count up it fast, I look for a bag and go get it
Hundreds of bags of gas, the OG abusive, the pack lemon cookie
Two hundred my dash, I drown like a drag, might fuck 'round and crash on that bullshit
Suck on that dick with the lipstick, I fuck on that ho, make a movie
Fuck on that ho, she a groupie
Let her ride in that foreign and lose it
She a new ho, I recruit it
Heard she used to fuck with the bro Uzi
Told her bend over and toot it
I wanna fuck so let's do it
It didn't take us long to get to it
And they grey hat came off 'fore she blew it
