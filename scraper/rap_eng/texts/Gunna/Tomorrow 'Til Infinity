[Intro: Young Thug & Gunna]
(Hope I see you, tomorrow
I'm tryna see you, tomorrow)
Yeah, I'm the black Christian Grey, you know what I'm sayin'?
(I wanna be you, tomorrow)
I got fifty shades of baes with me, fifty different bitches
Yeah!
I want to see you
I want to see you
I'ma see you, tomorrow
Ooh I'ma see you
Can't wait to see you
I'ma see you, tomorrow

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I know you ride ride ride
I got three bitches on the slide
I put some Forgis on my ride
Me and my dawgs headed to the sky
Cloud nine calling me
Couple bad bitches, too
I got money on me
Listening to "Digits", ooh
Feet up, baby girl, let's live
PJ money, yeah, Bentley's gonna deliver, mm
Two racks for my shoes, my Jimmy Choos
My bitch in Chanel, pity the fool
I got Chanel on my socks, ayy
Silk and Versace her crotch, ayy
Ben and Jerry, 'bouta eat her ice cream
I came from pillar to post
Ice in my bag, my back on froze
Penthouse home, Chicago
Yeah, that my second home
I'm in Atlanta, though
I just got back home
I got my money now
Tat my ribs, Hillstone, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug & Gunna]
I just wanna see tomorrow
I'm tryna see tomorrow
Let's fly away, long time, ain't late
I was speed racing

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gunna]
I know you ride, ride, ride
But I'm tired of trying
No matter what, you gotta stay by my side
Right or wrong, you better ride or die
'Til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity
Ride, ride, ride, 'til infinity

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm about to buy you your own ride
I don't need you involved in homicides
Got this weed from Texas you think you fried
I'm 'bout to fuck this ho outside
Horses make my three-wheeler slide
Actavis gang 'til I (yeah) die
Shawty was weak, oh-oh, gangbangers
Shawty was weak, oh-oh
Hold up, money is the reason I arrived
Bitch, I keep a knife like Michael Myers
I was 'bout to stab 'em thirty times like porcupines
And I got rainbow diamonds on like Mike 'n' Ikes

[Interlude: Young Thug & Gunna]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gunna]
I know you ride, ride, ride
But I'm tired of trying
No matter what, you gotta stay by my side
Right or wrong, you better ride or die
'Til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity
Ride, ride, ride, 'til infinity

[Outro: Young Thug]
I wanna see you, tomorrow
I'm tryna see you, tomorrow
I'm tryna see you, tomorrow
Tomorrow
