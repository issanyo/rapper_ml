[Chorus: Paris]
Ayy, watch me fade every day in the mornin'
2 a.m., yeah I'm sippin' and I'm zonin'
Watch me move, watch me sway, watch me dip out
In a room full of girls I'm tryna dig out
I just broke all the banks and now I'm po'ed up
If she bad, and she boujee then she know us
That ain't love, that ain't trust, that ain't me, though
Feel a way about you, I don't need ya, no

[Verse 1: Paris]
You ain't know, bet you know now
Fuck you mean you don't know us?
Fell in love with a bank, she wanna lay where I stay
I want all of my cake

[Chorus: Paris]
Ayy, watch me fade every day in the mornin'
2 a.m., yeah, I'm sippin' and I'm zonin'
Watch me move, watch me sway, watch me dip out
In a room full of girls I'm tryna dig out
I just broke all the banks and now I'm po'ed up
If she bad, and she boujee then she know us
That ain't love, that ain't trust, that ain't me, though
Feel a way about you, I don't need ya, no

[Bridge: Paris]
I keep losin' all my shit
All night long I'm on my way, yeah, so keep
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' all the time, yeah
Hope I see tomorrow, how the hell could I know?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' all the time, yeah
Hope I see tomorrow, how the hell could I know?

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Runnin' in that foreign, got 200 in the console
Yeah I'm one of one, got two bitches in my condo
I don't talk as much, we just havin' money convos
Can I make this one more? Shoot up shit like Rondo
I can buy a nigga hoe with all these hunchos
Yeah at servin' time, we wait until the store closed
Gotta work for that Rolex, I want that rose gold
Told you once before, this shit ain't no joke

[Chorus: Paris]
Ayy, watch me fade every day in the mornin'
2 a.m., yeah, I'm sippin' and I'm zonin'
Watch me move, watch me sway, watch me dip out
In a room full of girls I'm tryna dig out
I just broke all the banks and now I'm po'ed up
If she bad, and she boujee then she know us
That ain't love, that ain't trust, that ain't me, though
Feel a way about you, I don't need ya, no
