[Chorus: Kevin George]
She want love me, I want love me
She want love me, she came running
Took our money, I had hundreds
She want all this, all this money
She don't love me, she don't love me
All my money, all my hundreds
She wanna run it, she can't run it
You don't love me, she don't love me, yeah

[Verse 1: Kevin George]
We can dance if you wanted, yeah
Hundred grand make her horny, yeah
By the way, I want it on me, baby
Love it when I got my gas on deck, yeah
She want my gas on deck
Said she love the way my backshots hit, yeah
She rollin' backwards, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin George]
She want love me, I want love me
She want love me, she came running
Took our money, I had hundreds
She want all this, all this money
She don't love me, she don't love me
All my money, all my hundreds
She wanna run it, she can't run it
You don't love me, she don't love me, yeah

[Verse 2: Gunna]
No she don't
No she don't but she know I got dough on me
New clothes on me, put the Rolls on Forgis
New condo's a donkey, but my bitch a Yorkie
And I know she don't wanna love 'cause we grown
Ain't your fault 'cause you grown, we was out, now we on
Push the pedal down the road, will I love her, never know
Private jet goin' home this the life that you want

[Chorus: Kevin George]
She want love me, I want love me
She want love me, she came running
Took our money, I had hundreds
She want all this, all this money
She don't love me, she don't love me
All my money, all my hundreds
She wanna run it, she can't run it
You don't love me, she don't love me, yeah

[Outro: Kevin George]
She want love me, I want love me
She want love me, she came running
Took our money, I had hundreds
She want all this, all this money, yeah
All this money, yeah
All this money
All my hundreds
All these hundreds, yeah
She don't love me, yeah
She don't love me, yeah
I thought you loved me
