[Chorus: Gunna]
Gunna take a picture, it's a Kodak
This is not an AP, it's a Rolex
I'ma [?] like I stole that
I'ma keep that semi, I'll load that
If you want a Bentley gotta own it
I just made a hit and I ain't know it
If you get wit' me you can't lose it
You just gotta stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused

[Verse 1: Gunna]
I'm just tryna stay focused
And just tryna get my money right
Tryna thumb a hunnid every night
Gotta make sure that my momma right
Niggas hatin' on the kid man
Got the Molly, that's the same color scented
They come a dime nigga, even if I take a sack
Niggas geekin' and that shit'll got you toe-tagged
Gather 'round-'round, seven bands
Now I pull up outside and I park the Jag
I can see you through the glass nigga digi-dash
Got a pretty bitch who [?] and got a Fendi bag
I'm a mother[?] boss too
Hand to get a couple thou' 'fore I walked through
I can call a couple killers and they gon' shoot
I just wanna cut the ceilin' nigga, no roof
If I want it, I'ma have it
These niggas ain't the only one's who savage
The money get you put inside a casket
They say he get a mil' and make it massive
I love my homies with a passion
I be drippin' for a livin', lotta fashion
Gotta some bitches and they lovin' like a [?]
We gon' pop it on the camera nigga, action

[Chorus: Gunna]
Gunna take a picture, it's a Kodak
This is not an AP, it's a Rolex
I'ma [?] like I stole that
I'ma keep that semi, I'll load that
If you want a Bentley gotta own it
I just made a hit and I ain't know it
If you get wit' me you can't lose it
You just gotta stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused

[Verse 2: Nechie]
Uh, uh
It's your choice
You gotta stay focused, you cannot get lost dawg
I'm in the courts
You callin', I'm drivin'
It's all blue and it came wit' a horse
Hol' up, wait (Skrt)
You should hear the exhaust
Now you thinkin' what it cost
Now you thinkin' like a boss
See momma got bills and it's work that I'm havin
I gotta get off
You talk like you gangsta
You run up on Nechie and I'ma get off
And that's a Glizzy, yeah the .23
I was shootin' shit like 23
You must of forgot you was lost
No cushion, I was startin' to cross up
You should've think 'fore you talked up
Open your eyes, need to watch more
'Cause youngin', he caught out the nawf dawg
Bring the water, water, all this water, water
'Cause I'm hotter than a [?]
Screamin' [?] your mother, rather [?] your daughter
Puttin' dick up in her mouth dawg


[Chorus: Gunna]
Gunna take a picture, it's a Kodak
This is not an AP, it's a Rolex
I'ma [?] like I stole that
I'ma keep that semi, I'll load that
If you want a Bentley gotta own it
I just made a hit and I ain't know it
If you get wit' me you can't lose it
You just gotta stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
I'm just tryna stay focused
