[Intro: Gunna]
Yeah
Playmakers
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Gunna]
Jumped in that Benz, then I peeled off
Brought out a ten, I'ma spend it all
I need some pills and some seals, dawg
Fuck the cops, we got our own laws
Need to free my dawg, he's locked behind the walls
Numb to the pain, I can't feel shit at all

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Blew a ten
On a Wednesday, stack these bands
Heard you rent wasn't paid, need a lend
Just like Frito-Lay, I'ma feed my friends
Got white like Nicky Barnes, cop these two door foreigns
My bitch can't be borin' (Nah), ice on both my arms
Don't approach, I'm armed, flawless diamond charm
All my spots alarmed, big house feel like a dorm
It's on the north, young Gunna don't love no whore
I came with the wave no shore, my voice a little hoarse
I'm whippin' around in a Porsche, I'm ballin' outside of the court
Never knew I could make it in sports

[Chorus: Gunna & Lil Baby]
Jumped in that Benz, then I peeled off
Brought out a ten, I'ma spend it all
I need some pills and some seals, dawg
Fuck the cops, we got our own laws
Need to free my dawg, he's locked behind the walls
Numb to the pain, I can't feel shit at all
(I'm on these Percs, I can't feel shit at all)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby & Gunna]
Jumped in and I went far, my new girl super large
Paid cash for all my cars, protected but I'm raw
Addicted to the awe, me and Gunna double R
Rich rollin', I'm a star, don't take shots from the bar
But I'm ballin' like Lavar
I put drip all in my lingo, I went crazy
Louis Supreme jean jacket for my baby
My kid a walking lick, I put VVS on his neck
Fucked my sidepiece, some new breasts
Fresh off of high speed in that 'Vette
I can't stop, can't miss this shit, you know I'm never late
Bought a penthouse at the top so I can meditate
On top now 'cause I'm up I gotta elevate
Worth a million five for real, so I accept the hate

[Chorus: Gunna & Lil Baby]
Jumped in that Benz, then I peeled off
Brought out a ten, I'ma spend it all
I need some pills and some seals, dawg
Fuck the cops, we got our own laws
Need to free my dawg, he's locked behind the walls
Numb to the pain, I can't feel shit at all
(I'm on these Percs, I can't feel shit at all)
