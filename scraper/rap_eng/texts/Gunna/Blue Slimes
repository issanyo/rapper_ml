[Intro: Lil Gotit]
Ooh
Hood Baby
Hood talk, uh

[Chorus: Lil Gotit]
Big gun gon' take some risks
I'm with blue slimes and shit
Fiji water, gon' tap my wrist
Stoner life, smokin' on Hercules
Get money, ain't standin' no bitch
Meditate, let me roll my weed
I've been runnin' up bands all week
Then I spend this shit all on drip
Now my money comin' out my lips
Get a bag, I ain't stuntin' that shit
Sometimes you gotta take some risks
Wipe a nigga nose quick, when I'm 'bout my slimes
Got green and red and blue slimes
Get high 'til my brain fried
Updated my wrist, a new time

[Verse 1: Skooly]
I'm wildin' on 'em, they know I'm stylin' on 'em, uh
I'm with the slime lil' stoners, Lil Gotit be wildin', homie
Lil Gotit get violent on 'em, I'm high as a pilot, homie
My diamonds real, they from Africa, my guns from 'round the corner, yeah
Hotbox, Maserati, four seater, smell it when the doors swing
Skybox, too far, floor seats, wrist look like ocean
Turtleneck, movin' like a turtle tortoise, lean like morphine
Drip Season comin' back, Gunna back, turn your bitch to running back
These double C's on, these gone, VLONE, lumberjack
Louis Vuitton, where my money at? Versace right up under that
Dolly White drip Vera Wang, iced out my chain, not my brain
Alexander Wang, ain't the same
Diamonds Off-White like beige

[Chorus: Lil Gotit]
Big gun gon' take some risks
I'm with blue slimes and shit
Fiji water, gon' tap my wrist
Stoner life, smokin' on Hercules
Get money, ain't standin' no bitch
Meditate, let me roll my weed
I've been runnin' up bands all week
Then I spend this shit all on drip
Now my money comin' out my lips
Get a bag, I ain't stuntin' that shit
Sometimes you gotta take some risks
Wipe a nigga nose quick, when I'm 'bout my slimes
Got green and red and blue slimes
Get high 'til my brain fried
Updated my wrist, a new time

[Chorus: Lil Gotit]
Big gun gon' take some risks

Fiji water, gon' tap my wrist
Stoner life, smokin' on Hercules
Get money, ain't standin' no bitch
Meditate, let me roll my weed
I've been runnin' up bands all week
Then I spend this shit all on drip
Now my money comin' out my lips
Get a bag, I ain't stuntin' that shit
Sometimes you gotta take some risks
Wipe a nigga nose quick, when I'm 'bout my slimes
Got green and red and blue slimes
Get high 'til my brain fried
Updated my wrist, a new time

[Verse 3: Dolly White]
Ridin' round in an Aston Martin (No cap)
Never look, cause I'm up to par (I'm up to par)
Never needed no approval (No approval)

For the price, I got new new (Fuck it)
Whole crew drippin' crazy, fool
Whole crew drippin' crazy, fool

Shit I be drippin', you wouldn't expect from me (Nah)
You wouldn't expect from me
Not goin' nowhere, unless it a check for me (Unless it a check for me)

Skooly ain't never forgot 'em (Skooly ain't never forgot 'em)
Lil Keed on the horizon

[Chorus: Lil Gotit]
Big gun gon' take some risks
I'm with blue slimes and shit
Fiji water, gon' tap my wrist
Stoner life, smokin' on Hercules
Get money, ain't standin' no bitch
Meditate, let me roll my weed
I've been runnin' up bands all week
Then I spend this shit all on drip
Now my money comin' out my lips
Get a bag, I ain't stuntin' that shit
Sometimes you gotta take some risks
Wipe a nigga nose quick, when I'm 'bout my slimes
Got green and red and blue slimes
Get high 'til my brain fried
Updated my wrist, a new time

[Verse 4: Lil Keed]
Yeah, big body Benz, yeah
I got Gucci frames on, got the tint
You ain't never count me out, I'm fuckin' on her, and her friends
And that Goyard pouch, know the inside creepin'
Yeah I met lil' slime, though, push up with that TEC
These Elliot diamonds gon' blind him, I put that on my set
Every heavy bricks, yellow molly, yeah, it's grits
I got old socks and old shoes on, shit, it drip, yeah yeah
Yeah, make that ho stay over there
She traded on me, how it feel?
Yeah, I'm with Skooly, we got this drank on chill
Me and Lil Gotit, we the topic

Drip too hard, just like Gunna
.223 shot leave 'em in trauma (Let's go, let's go)
