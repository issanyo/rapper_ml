[Chorus: Nafe Smallz & M Huncho]
We coming from broken homes
My niggas still smoking cones
And bitches knowing all the songs
The Rollie need frozen stones
And we be trapping on them phones like BT
And she ain't ever phoning home like E.T
I be in the coldest zones (Coldest zones)
I fuck her with the Rolex on (Rolex on)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Nafe Smallz]
The price too low, we ain’t pulling up to that show (Nah)
I'm repping for the O, the CEO, and I got the shoes on go (Yeah)
I made a type of money I ain't seen before
Paying out the lord, tryna beat the law
It’s 4am, I might creep some more
Bad lil' bitch she gon' freak some more
Yeah, yeah, uh
The bottom ain't a place for me
I'm running to the money impatiently
In a room full of niggas you would hate to meet (Yeah)
All I ever did is wait patiently
But that was never getting nothing done for me
We strapped on the body like dungarees
She wanna fuck the kid and make love with me
The zone still lit, and you know the joint still lit, ay
You smoking one spliff, I'm smoking one zip
I tell them niggas get it how you live (Yeah)
You're looking at your wrist, and you ain't got a crib
I tell them niggas get it how you live (Yeah)
We’re buying more bricks, we’re buying more sticks
They told me I should get it how I live

[Chorus: Nafe Smallz & M Huncho]
We coming from broken homes (Broken homes)
My niggas still smoking cones (Smoking cones)
And bitches knowing all the songs
The Rollie need frozen stones (Frozen stones)
And we be trapping on them phones like BT
And she ain't ever phoning home like E.T
I be in the coldest zones (Coldest zones)
I fuck her with the Rolex on

[Verse 2: M Huncho]
Brown sugar, I was just rolling stones (Rolling stones)
Hero’ plus the long black coat (Yeah)
Heroin in my pores (Yeah)
I was in an all black cab with a bad b
She had to ask if this is Fake Taxi
Need to take this kilo home (Yeah, kilo home)
Nokia, all my phones (Yeah)
Still stressed, got a broken dome (Dome)
Bought a ting just to match my clothes
No face, no case, straight ace
Wimbledon Rolex on (Rolex on)
Nafe could've hit her with the ice on deck
No Riz gotta bill it with Smallz (Bill it with Smallz)
No, prick, I don't answer your calls (No no)
Broken homes and it wasn't my fault (Yeah)
Got some bags in a bag in the vault
Got some dude from Swiss on my coat (On my coat)
This ain’t no joke
Jugg on my own
Got me a house on the road
I'm real and it's all in my bone (Bone)
Broken homes but I didn't fold (I didn't fold)
I got me some cash and it doesn't fold
I smoke me a zip, I sign out from the world (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Nafe Smallz & M Huncho]
We coming from broken homes (Broken homes)
My niggas still smoking cones (Smoking cones)
And bitches knowing all the songs (All the songs)
The Rollie need frozen stones (Frozen stones)
And we be trapping on them phones like BT
And she ain't ever phoning home like E.T
I be in the coldest zones
I fuck her with the Rolex on

[Verse 3: Gunna]
I fuck her with the Rolex on (Yeah)
I fuck her to all of my songs (Yeah)
I put a chandelier in my home (Yeah)
I'm hopping on a lear and I'm gone (I'm gone)
I fuck her like a dog need a bone (A bone)
I'm with Thug to pull the choppers all rose (All rose)
Now I spend 100 thousand on clothes (On clothes)
Fashion week I did a video for Vogue (Yeah)
Ask around, I been off the porch (I been off the porch)
Her ass fat and her hair real long (Hair real long)
Skinny nigga and I'm smokin' on the narcs (On narcs)
Run 4 and I get in my zone (Get in my zone)
In the kitchen, had to cook it with a fork (With a fork)
Life's changed now my car is a Porsche (Is a Porsche)
And that nigga dripping harder then ya boy (Yeah)
So now my niggas have a party with ya whore (Party with ya whore)
Hit the club and pop a bottle with ya boy (Bottle with ya boy)
We got money, gotta let these bitches know (Let these bithces know)
Paint a picture, got a A+ in art (A+ in art)
And my yé with the top out the car (Top out the car)
Want a star, so I iced out the star (Iced out the star)
Fuck the cops, we don't live by the law (Live by the law)
