[Chorus: FXXXXY]
Backup
Save us both the hassle
Don’t say what u don’t mean
If u won’t stand by me when I need you
Girl, like when I need you

[Verse 1: FXXXXY]
Why do u push all my limits
What am I missing? Why do I give but don’t get it?
Kept the relationship quiet but I didn’t hide I was in it
Girl, that’s some wisdom
I held it down to the minute
I deserve plenty
I deserve more than you giving
I deserve sex that’s so vivid
That shit gon' grab on my spirit
And fuck up my memory
I can say so much about you
But got nothing else to say to you
So loyal shit is unusual
Maybe that’s what u got used to, And oh by the way
That's why I had to go way
U need some time and some space
You need to fuck on these niggas and learn why these bitches complain
All of these niggas is lame
Lately, I’m doin' my thing, yeah
Associates on magazines, yeah
Mama done Raised her a king, yeah
King, yeah
Went thru some things but I’m clean, yeah
Fucked on some hoes UNT, yeah
They let me rebound for free, yeah
But even when the lights off I was dreaming u and me yeah

[Chorus: FXXXXY]
Backup
Save us both the hassle
Don’t say what u don’t mean
If u won’t stand by me when I need you
Girl, like when I need you

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I just can't stay mad at you
Tell you the truth
Girl I'm love what u do
I wanna ride on the south with the top off the coup
Two-door, just me and you
Sippin codeine so much I gotta bad tooth
Popping off tags, ooh
She sucking my dick at the tip
I tip, gratitude, I like her attitude
Baby ain't petty for us we been bonding
Countin' that money
Whipped overseas she met me out in London
Bankroll full of hundreds
That cap that you telling me
It ain't mean nothing then
I did that shit times ten
Copped a new whip and you renew your license
CL all white Benz

[Chorus: FXXXXY]
Backup
Save us both the hassle
Don’t say what u don’t mean
If u won’t stand by me when I need you
Girl, like when I need you

[Outro: FXXXXY]
Backup
Save us both the hassle
I can work it out for you, baby
Tempation still drive me crazy when I need you
And Ima pour the liquor right now right now
With a new shorty right now right now
Thinking 'bout you right now right now
This a freestyle yeah for free, yeah
I can say this from my brain brain brain, yeah
Cuz all these feels remain
Make it hard to maintain
