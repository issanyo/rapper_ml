[Intro]
Yeah, turn it up
Tu-turn it in the headphones
My nigga Wheezy, you know what I'm sayin'
Ooh-ooh, yeah-eah-eah
Doughboy
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Chorus]
I can't be a regular pedestrian
I got on my grind, ain't no more stressing
Can't nobody stop me from my blessings
Find the finest, got designer on my headband
Can we have a threesome with your best friend?
She suck dick quick, didn't have no time to cut on Netflix
Gotta watch these bitches, shit be hectic
Can't let no nigga trick me off my exit

[Verse 1]
Stars on my Air Forces, these Givenchy
Kill you like abortion, leave your head cracked
Burn this mile like rubber on the Hellcat
No I work my muscle all day, I'm carrying cash
Slap the hundred round drum in the Kel-Tec (kill)
Double cup filled with mud, I sip real red (real red)
Bank robbing got my cuz fifteen years fed (fifteen years fed)
He a solid get money nigga with a hard head (hard head)
Stacking these loaves of bread, I want more and more (more and more)
My bitch showed me a bag, cost some hunchos (hunchos)
Double-0-7 coupe, stash console
On the road cashing these checks like I four-four (four-four)

[Chorus]
I can't be a regular pedestrian
I got on my grind, ain't no more stressing
Can't nobody stop me from my blessings
Find the finest, got designer on my headband
Can we have a threesome with your best friend?
She suck dick quick, didn't have no time to cut on Netflix
Gotta watch these bitches, shit be hectic
Can't let no nigga trick me off my exit

[Verse 2]
Life is ruthless, now the car coupeish, we don't need roofs
If I get Frank Lucas rich, know I do it for King Troup
I been ballin' out of the park, I feel like Babe Ruth
Hearin' a lot of lil' talking but I'm paid too
Bitches in my phone, she say I miss you
How you get this line? last time I saw you was in high school
VVS's bright, they shine like lights, ooh
Rockin' all this ice, my shit must be swole
Comme des Gar√ßons, I put that shit on
Ones that want the lift 'cause this money long
I know I got strength 'cause this weed strong
This the smell cost me fifteen hundred on cologne

[Chorus]
I can't be a regular pedestrian
I got on my grind, ain't no more stressing
Can't nobody stop me from my blessings
Find the finest, got designer on my headband
Can we have a threesome with your best friend?
She suck dick quick, didn't have no time to cut on Netflix
Gotta watch these bitches, shit be hectic
Can't let no nigga trick me off my exit

[Bridge]
Took a pill yesterday and I'm still high (yeah)
Pick a private plane for a lift, yeah (yeah)
Took a pill yesterday and I'm still high (yeah)
Take a private plane for a lift, yeah

[Chorus]
I can't be a regular pedestrian
I got on my grind, ain't no more stressing
Can't nobody stop me from my blessings
Find the finest, got designer on my headband
Can we have a threesome with your best friend?
She suck dick quick, didn't have no time to cut on Netflix
Gotta watch these bitches, shit be hectic
Can't let no nigga trick me off my exit

[Outro]
