[Intro: Gunna]
I ain't sellin' my soul
I just need to slow down
We got London On Da Track
I ain't sellin' my soul
I just need to slow down
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Gunna, he the real dripper
Tight Balmain denim
Rockstar style killer
Got choppers like a wild villain
Bitch, let me dig in her (I dig)
I done left my kids in her (damn)
I been trappin' since a jit (that's a child)
And you lookin' at a mid dealer
Diamonds shinnin' like a lighthouse
Ten thousand on me right now (racks)
Seven grams of the dark stuff
Baby boy need to pipe down
Gettin' slices of the bread now
Keepin' track like a head count (like a head)
I been countin' cash in every route
It's been hard to book a show south

[Chorus: Gunna]
I been on the road (I been on the road)
I'm about to roll out (roll)
Do you wanna roll? (do you wanna roll?)
Need to let me know now (need to let me know now)
I been movin' slow (I been movin' slow)
I just need to slow down (slow down)
'Bout to cop a Rolls ('bout to cop a Rolls)
Ain't sellin' my soul (soul)

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I just use her just for sex
I'm a send the bitch a text later
I'm that boy that coppin' all flavors
New Gucci's, they was all gators
Black diamond like Darth Vader
In the booth, still countin' paper
Gotta chance it, I'm a risk taker
Now the chopper got round like Haiti
Hangin' with some Slimes, you ain't my kind
Nigga, stop lyin', you a faker
I'm readin' your sign, pick up your vibe
Fuck around and meet your maker
Nigga, might pop your tater
Glock in the sock gon' rock your cranium
Ain't got nothing else to say to you
I'm stompin' you out with the latest shoe

[Chorus: Gunna]
I been on the road (I been on the road)
I'm about to roll out (roll)
Do you wanna roll? (do you wanna roll?)
Need to let me know now (need to let me know now)
I been movin' slow (I been movin' slow)
I just need to slow down (slow down)
'Bout to cop a Rolls ('bout to cop a Rolls)
Ain't sellin' my soul (soul)

[Outro: Gunna]
Ain't sellin' my soul
I just need to slow down
We got London on da Track
(We got London on da Track) ain't sellin' my soul
We got Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you more, nigga
I just need to slow down
