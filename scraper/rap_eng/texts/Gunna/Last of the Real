[Intro: Jose Guapo & Gunna]
Yeah (yeah)
(Yeah), Gunna and Guapo
Uh, extravagant drip
Run that back Turbo
You dig?

[Chorus: Gunna & Jose Guapo]
Yeah, I just got the skin on the bear (uh)
Gotta get the riches and wealth (uh)
I might spend a mil on myself (uh)
'Nother million for the clique (uh)
We the last real niggas left (uh-huh)
I'ma keep it real 'til the death (uh)
Never need a hand or get help (uh-huh)

[Verse 1: Joe Guapo]
Uh, you know I came in by myself
You they type of nigga get shelved
I got some Loubs on my shelves
I'm rockin' an Off-White belt, I put Chanel on my back
We was broke and we ain't never goin' back
We was broke and we ain't never goin' back, uh
Close the curtains on the new Maybach
This bitch is too thick and I hit from the back
Pop a perc, now I beat out her back
Fuck a ho then I count up my racks
I can blow a mil in a day-ay-ay
I'm not gonna stop 'til we straight-ay-ay
We at the top, lil nigga just face it
I'm rockin' Louis Vuitton bracelets
I go to the spa and plus I get facial
One call, I swear they'll erase you
I'm not gonna race you
Roll up a Backwood and face it
Gunna Gunna in the coupe
I'm in the spaceship, uh, bitch

[Chorus: Gunna]
Yeah, I just got the skin on the bear
Gotta get the riches and wealth
I might spend a mil on myself
'Nother million for the clique
We the last real niggas left
I'ma keep it real 'til the death
Never need a hand or get help

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I can never switch, nigga this is it, I predicted I'd get rich
This as drippy as it gets, fur carpet cheetah prints
Hit the condo with your bitch, give her psychedelic dick
G seats in the jet, coppin' these baguettes
Nigga still threaten me, niggas so petty
Playin' with the ice, Wayne Gretzky
Bitch pocket light, that's a pet peeve
Fuckin' with the bag, get the neck cheap
Bought a big yacht, not a jet-ski
VVS it make her pussy wet, yeah

[Chorus: Gunna]
I just got the skin on the bear
Gotta get the riches and wealth
I might spend a mil on myself
'Nother million for the clique
We the last real niggas left
I'ma keep it real 'til the death
Never need a hand or get help
