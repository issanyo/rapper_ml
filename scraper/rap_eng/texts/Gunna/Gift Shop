[Intro: Usher]
(Zaytoven)
I walk up in that motherfucker like, get what you want
Ayy, let me get that
Gift shop, gift shop, yeah

[Chorus: Usher]
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop
Locked in the bag like a Ziploc
Got your main thing in the lip-lock
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop
Audemars don't go tick-tock (Tick-tock)
Ice box diamonds in my wrist watch (Wrist watch)

[Verse 1: Usher]
Got it, I'ma spend it, gotta do it big
'Cause I be talkin' more than millions (Yeah)
Court-side, no tickets
Blue tint, sittin' pretty, uh, yeah, uh
I'm in your bitch like, yeah (Yeah)
Hop in that whip, and smash
What's on my neck? That glass
That foreign lil' whip been crashed
A lot of those diamonds ain't real
My nigga gon' get it how he live (Yeah)
Good life, who this?
She do what she can for a Fendi bag (Yeah)
Iced out wrist, that gliss, that gliss, that gliss
Girl on my dick, my tip, my tip

[Chorus: Usher]
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Locked in the bag like a Ziploc (Ziploc)
Got your main thing in the lip-lock (Yeah, yeah)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Audemars don't go tick-tock (Tick-tock)
Ice box diamonds in my wrist watch (Wrist watch)

[Bridge: Usher]
Way, way, way (Add it up)
Came, came, came (To fuck it up)
Foreign whips, new Mulsanne
Kick shit, no Lui Kang

[Chorus: Usher]
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Locked in the bag like a Ziploc (Ziploc)
Got your main thing in the lip-lock (Yeah, yeah)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Audemars don't go tick-tock (Tick-tock)
Ice box diamonds in my wrist watch (Wrist watch)

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I treat the Gucci store like a gift shop
I put some Fiji water in a wrist watch
Then showed her how to ball like a big shark
I spent a couple thousand on her ass shots
She got all colors in the G socks
That's a Rolex not a G-Shock (G-Shock)
I'm diggin' in her while she got her legs locked (Got her legs locked)
We fuckin' in the penthouse at the tip top (Oh)
Make her cum again, spend a hundred bands, new Mercedes-Benz
Gucci store again, had to let us in, private when we land
I gave her a chance, gave her the advance, diamond on her hands
VVS' dance, Off-White on the Vans, Tesla for a van
I'm rubbin' on her skin, she gon' let me in, we ain't gon' pretend
I'm her latest friend, she don't chase her Hen' and ain't scared to sin
I'ma give her a lend, purse that cost a ten, help her on the rent
We just wanna win, just don't care to spend, Gucci store again

[Chorus: Usher]
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Locked in the bag like a Ziploc (Ziploc)
Got your main thing in the lip-lock (Yeah, yeah)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Audemars don't go tick-tock (Tick-tock)
Ice box diamonds in my wrist watch (Wrist watch)

[Bridge: Usher]
Way, way, way
This shit, got me feelin' like Michael
She call me her idol
She play me Tidal
She cum on arrival
But I don't want no bridal
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Usher]
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Locked in the bag like a Ziploc (Ziploc)
Got your main thing in the lip-lock (Yeah, yeah)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Audemars don't go tick-tock (Tick-tock)
Ice box diamonds in my wrist watch (Wrist watch)

[Outro: Usher]
Got it, I'ma spend it, gotta do it big
'Cause I be talkin' more than millions (Yeah)
Court-side, no tickets
Blue tint, sittin' pretty, uh, yeah, uh
I'm in your bitch like, yeah (Yeah)
Hop in that whip, and smash
What's on my neck? That glass
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Locked in the bag like a Ziploc (Ziploc)
Got your main thing in the lip-lock (Yeah, yeah)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
