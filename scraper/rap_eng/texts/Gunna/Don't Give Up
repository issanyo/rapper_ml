[Chorus]
I call the shots, I'm a coach
I came to kill like a Zoe
I'm only feeding my folks
Climb to the top like a rope
Chokers all 'round my neck, I'ma choke
We cleaning this money with soap
With this bread, I stack every loaf
Talk to God, ain't losing no hope
Don't give up
Don't give up
I hope you don't give up
Don't give up, no

[Verse 1]
They call me Gunna the GOAT
Keep me a gun and I tote
Niggas be doin' the most
Can't go out sad with you hoes
I gotta stick to the code
I water my money then grow it
Shit big and it's 'bout to explode
Tesla got suicide doors
Yes I'm reaching my goals
It's a check every one of my shows
Had the handmaid tailor my clothes
It's a pay day nigga, you owe
Lot of diamonds on me, I'm cold
I got fashion on me like Vogue
Whole lotta drip, better leave me alone
My bitch got pink toes
I don't wanna leave it alone
I wanna fuck when I want
Got the piece flooded with stones
Baby not runnin' me home
My brother dead and gone
We was just livin' wrong
Sip out the pain in the morning

[Chorus]
I call the shots, I'm a coach
I came to kill like a Zoe
I'm only feeding my folks
Climb to the top like a rope
Chokers all 'round my neck, I'ma choke
We cleaning this money with soap
With this bread, I stack every loaf
Talk to God, ain't losing no hope
Don't give up
Don't give up
I hope you don't give up
Don't give up, no

[Verse 2]
I used to shop at the Ross
How I still win from a loss
Got hired, done turned to a boss
Ride in that Maybach like Ross
I got this water like Voss
I wanna fuck in her mouth
They callin', you know I'm en route
I heard that you had a drought
I made it ship, make it bounce
Every day I smoke more than an ounce
Money machine, let it count
Clothes that can dress up a house
We loyal, you in our you out?
I ran up my bag like a sprout
Trust me I know what it's 'bout
Fed screams and I'm out
Get the racks and you bustin' it down
The cash route
Run it up, showin' no slouch
Glass house
Shittin' on whoever look down
You nigga need you a vouch
Every day I'ma drip to the ground

[Chorus]
I call the shots, I'm a coach
I came to kill like a Zoe
I'm only feeding my folks
Climb to the top like a rope
Chokers all 'round my neck, I'ma choke
We cleaning this money with soap
With this bread, I stack and reload
Talk to God, ain't losing no hope
Don't give up
Don't give up
I hope you don't give up
Don't give up, no
