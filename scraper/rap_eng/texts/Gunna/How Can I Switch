[Chorus: Gunna & Young Trez]
I look like a lick, got ice on my wrist
Cause' I took a risk, Chanel on my kicks
How can I switch? How can I switch?
I cannot switch
I'm poppin' this shit til' the day I die
I can't even sit up and tell you a lie
Takin' a trip over to Dubai
Don't run up on Young cause' you know I'm gon' fire

[Verse 1: Young Trez]
Watch me pull up in that white and grape Wraith
These niggas hate that's on these nigga's fate
Real nigga shit and you cannot relate
We keepin' them flaws and we know that you fake
Riding with Gunna, Draco like Osama
We ride behind 10, Presidential Obama
You dissin' fire shit then we shoot up your Mama
I got them bales coming in by the bundle
Takin' the top floor to condo
Gave the bitch 500 just to score
It ain't nothing to me cause' I get me some more
200 around the corner in the Rari
Fuck all my haters I ain't saying sorry
Whip game 100 nigga that's a ''Fari
All these bales came in from the Cartel
Be careful shawty you know they gon' tell

[Chorus: Gunna & Young Trez]
I look like a lick, got ice on my wrist
Cause' I took a risk, Chanel on my kicks
How can I switch? How can I switch?
I cannot switch
I'm poppin' this shit til' the day I die
I can't even sit up and tell you a lie
Takin' a trip over to Dubai
Don't run up on Young cause' you know I'm gon' fire
I look like a lick, got ice on my wrist
Cause' I took a risk, Chanel on my kicks
How can I switch? How can I switch?
I cannot switch
I'm poppin' this shit til' the day I die
I can't even sit up and tell you a lie
Takin' a trip over to Dubai
Don't run up on Young cause' you know I'm gon' fire

[Verse 2: Gunna]
You know this a tag, I know what you think
I roll up some gas, I pour up some drank
I'll kill you a nigga and get you some stank
I see you got stripes, I know you got rank
I'm falling asleep, I poured up a pint
Heard you got the cheap, I need me some 'caine
Heard you niggas sweet, heard you niggas lame
I run up a check and you niggas can't
I get them gas bags if you want it
I bust a couple juugs with a 40
Fishin', go poppin' jewelry keep it on me
I'ma go cash out now nigga only
Nigga go cop the jewelry, bring the [?]
I see a 100,000 on the corner
Bitch I'm a boss I'll never be a runner
Bitch it's your girl popping shit with Gunna

[Chorus: Gunna & Young Trez]
I look like a lick, got ice on my wrist
Cause' I took a risk, Chanel on my kicks
How can I switch? How can I switch?
I cannot switch
I'm poppin' this shit til' the day I die
I can't even sit up and tell you a lie
Takin' a trip over to Dubai
Don't run up on Young cause' you know I'm gon' fire
