[Intro]
Yeah
Young Gunna
Young, ooh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I pour a four in the Sprite
Gunna control the hype
No gay shit, my clothes is tight
I ride like a motorbike
Moonwalk on my soul like Mike
I'm fuckin' your ho tonight
Yeezy Boots on, I might take a hike
Your shit trash, I don't see why you pipe
Off a gamble, I roll the dice
I know scammers that's known to swipe
Keep a hammer, I know you ain't right
VVS's like frozen ice
Yeah, I know but I still take advice
Need to free all my bros off of rice
Heard them crackers tryna play with your life
Get that dollar and don't drop a dime
That's why they pinning cases
Fuck it, it feel like we made it
Had a bucket now it's a Mercedes
It's Young Gunna the motherfuckin' latest
Ain't no cash shit, I came out the shady
But I walk anywhere on this pavement
Wrap them work then I'm back to the basics
I ain't racist, I fuck on all races
But I see you going places
Hop in that Rari and race it
That's Calamari, I taste it
I'm at the Aria in Vegas
I keep it so real, I can't fake it
I been sippin' that lean, got me lazy
I might stroke on it raw, have a baby
Nigga I shoot the AR like a Haitian

[Chorus]
I'm drippin' on 'em
I'm drippin' on 'em, yeah
I'm drippin' on 'em, I'm drippin' on 'em
I'm drippin' on 'em, I'm drippin' on 'em

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I took that drip to the palace
That drip you couldn't even imagine
This drip it gon' make me a legend
I hop in that coupe, it got gadgets
I got an FN and it's plastic
Not the small face, I'm getting the king Patek
Blue cheese hundreds all over my salad
I got some hoes in Magic
No capping, I know I'm having
I'm throwing your ho, let her have it
I hide the bankroll in the attic
In the safe and I bet you can't hack it
Nothing nice if you touch without asking
You get hit in that Benz four door matic
If you diss you gettin' shot when you lackin'
Used to rock that Ed Hardy jacket
Now it's bumble Balmains cost some rackades
I got hundreds bent up in the basket
I been killing the game with no casket
My lil bro brought the party package
I stay geeked up, I think I'm an addict
I been fucking this freak, I'm her daddy
Think you cuffing it but I been had it
Like the roof with the stars, I'ma put it in park
Had it fuckin' her hard, she don't want me to stop
I been drippin' it all, twenty racks in the mall
We been living it large, had that drip from the start

[Chorus]
I'm drippin' on 'em
I'm drippin' on 'em, yeah
I'm drippin' on 'em, I'm drippin' on 'em
I'm drippin' on 'em, I'm drippin' on 'em
