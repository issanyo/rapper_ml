[Chorus]
Rockstar status nigga, gotta have it
Rockstar status nigga, gotta have it
Gotta have it
Rockstar status nigga, gotta have it
Bitch I call the shots, I feel like Phil Jackson
Police by my spot and I was still trapping

[Verse 1]
Yeah, hop in the Benz
I put a F on the rim
Checkerboard all at my crib
Louis V, Louis V, Damier
That Franck Muller look like Cartier
Walk inside the mall and get me something to wear
Bitch I came from the sub I could never care
I was fucked up and broke, you was never there
What the fuck is a friend
They ain't got a hand they could lend
Last time I fell to the pen
I had to commit a sin
I dropped the ball and now I got it back
I went to jail and I ain't goin' back
I kept it solid, niggas knowing that
I'mma go the trap, run me up a sack
I'mma go the trap, run me up a sack
I'mma go the house, try to stack a bank
I'mma pull on the block, roll me up some dank
I'mma go to the yo, pour me up a pint
I'mma shit on these niggas and let 'em hate
Now this bitch wanna call, I'mma let her wait
Niggas want me to fall, hold your breath and wait
Bitch I'm never on time cause I'm always late

[Chorus]
Rockstar status nigga, gotta have it
Rockstar status nigga, gotta have it
Bitch I call the shots, I feel like Phil Jackson
Police by my spot and I was still trapping
Rockstar status nigga, gotta have it
Rockstar status nigga, gotta have it
Bitch I call the shots, I feel like Phil Jackson
Police by my spot and I was still trapping

[Verse 2]
Balling like Jordan
The bitch got me feeling like Tony
If you got a lick put me on it
I wanna see my opponent
The real ones, they running with Gunna
They know I'mma keep it one hunnid
We trap and we eat at Katana
That shit that you did, we done done it
Yeah yeah, if you want a bag nigga run it
My bro sell them shits on the corner
My plug really rich, she a grower
I serve all my plates with a blower
I think I might open a store
Remember I used to be poor
I can't stop it, I keep getting more
I can't stop it, I keep getting more
I see hoes when I walk through the door
Get them racks, put the safe in a floor
I done came a long way selling dope
It's their dreams and they try to sell hope
I sold lean and I tried to sell coke
I'm 6-0 bitch I run with the locs
Louis V checkerboard on my coat

[Chorus]
Rockstar status nigga, gotta have it
Rockstar status nigga, gotta have it
Bitch I call the shots, I feel like Phil Jackson
Police by my spot and I was still trapping
Rockstar status nigga, gotta have it
Rockstar status nigga, gotta have it
Bitch I call the shots, I feel like Phil Jackson
Police by my spot and I was still trapping
