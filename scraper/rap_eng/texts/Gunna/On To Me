[Hook]
Niggas they on to me
NIggas annoying me
Bitches be boring to me
Keep bitches on they knees
Get the racks they from overseas
Only owe me some foreign keys
Have you poppin' on cherry keys
I'm a dog like you pedigree
Fuck your hoe on the leather seat
Say you a dime bitch you better be
Wanna see you bend over and take the D
And I'm still dodging these felonies
My lil unc' on the block he still selling weed
Tell him when we get out we gon' never leave
Still got racks in my pocket like cheddar cheese
Got her wearing Chanel, she smelling me

[Verse 1]
Some ice on, it came out the fridge
Put some racks on your head like a fitted
I can see it in your eyes you weren't wit' it
And some niggas weren't fair they start snitching
And that shit get you kicked, no permission
Shit ain't hard nigga, play your position
Free my cousin they say he a menace
Keep the racks at the crew, we ain't finished
Take a lil bit of X and molly
Got done us another body
Hop in that horse and ride
I let her come get inside
[?] new 'mazi
She ain't my boss just like Rocky
When she get on the drugs she gets naughty
My bitch like my car she exotic

Still got racks in my pocket like cheddar cheese
Got on Coco Chanel, she smelling me

[Verse 2]
I wanna see that K, why you talking?
Let me see that drip whilst you walking
I wanna se finesse when you flossing
I'm taking that power, no Austin
And money come green like Boston
Young nigga don't need no vouchers
I'm still rocking Louis pouches
These bitches like "Ooh, we bosses"
Throw some ones make that booty start bouncing
Money counter, don't need no accountant
I went to the top of the mountain
[?] just to make that announcement
I drip and I drip like a faucet
These fuck niggas thought I done lost it
Put a line on my dick, told her snort it
I'm killing these hoes, need a coffin
