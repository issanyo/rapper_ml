[Intro: Lil Baby]
I been tourin'
Can't get to me
They can't get to me

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
They can't get to me because I'm up right now
They can't get to me because I'm up
Flyer than a motherfuckin' pilot
We been on the jets, we fly private
I just touched down in LA today, in New York tomorrow
Then I gotta go to Texas, I'll be back tomorrow
Ever since I was a youngin' I been chasin' every dollar
Count up them blue hundreds, we ain't got no money problems

[Verse 1: Gunna]
I'm tryna stack up and get it
I went from rags to riches
I blow the bag in Lenox
I heard your Jag was rented
I know you mad, admit it
Jump in that Lam and hit it
When I put that shit on I be drippin'
I fuck the baddest bitches
Bend that shit over, let me hit from the back
She got some good head, I'ma send her to Saks
Bitch I'm a dog and I'm killin' the cat
And I'm a slime, bitch you better free Yak
You niggas don't talk, boy you better relax
I make a call, get you beat with a bat
Get your shit popped like the top of a gnat
I got the cheese and you niggas is rats

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
They can't get to me because I'm up right now
They can't get to me because I'm up
Flyer than a motherfuckin' pilot
We been on the jets, we fly private
I just touched down in LA today, in New York tomorrow
Then I gotta go to Texas, I'll be back tomorrow
Ever since I was a youngin' I been chasin' every dollar
Count up them blue hundreds, we ain't got no money problems

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
And I left the hood broke, came back in a Murci√©lago
I might fuck on your daughter, I used to ride on MARTA
Bitch know I'm a player, I coach the team like Coach Carter
She tried to take me to Maury, no bitch I'm not the father
All of these bitches they know that we get it
Takin' them private flights city to city
The shit that they doin', we already did it
Never been losin', we already winning
Coupe fully loaded, it's already tinted
[?] off the lot, leave the top with the dealer
I'm not a rapper, bitch I am a dealer
They can't get to me 'cause I'm in the middle

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
They can't get to me because I'm up right now
They can't get to me because I'm up
Flyer than a motherfuckin' pilot
We been on the jets, we fly private
I just touched down in LA today, in New York tomorrow
Then I gotta go to Texas, I'll be back tomorrow
Ever since I was a youngin' I been chasin' every dollar
Count up them blue hundreds, we ain't got no money problems

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
We ain't got no money problems, we ain't got no money problems
I told 'em put me in the game coach, I'm a starter
And if she actin' like she need me I'ma starve her
Remember days ridin' on MARTA
But now we flyin' private jets to different cities
And I keep a bad bitch with me
Two chains everywhere like Tity, I done growed up
Bad bitches askin' where the weed, it's time to roll up

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
They can't get to me because I'm up right now
They can't get to me because I'm up
Flyer than a motherfuckin' pilot
We been on the jets, we fly private
I just touched down in LA today, in New York tomorrow
Then I gotta go to Texas, I'll be back tomorrow
Ever since I was a youngin' I been chasin' every dollar
Count up them blue hundreds, we ain't got no money problems
