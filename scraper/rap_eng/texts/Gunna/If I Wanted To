[Chorus: Lil Duke]
I couldn't even trust the bitch if I wanted to
Niggas be cappin', talking about what they gonna do
Dripping in designer like Zoboomafoo
Probably fucking on his bitch, no he ain't got a clue
She probably swear to God that she won't lie to you
Already doin' the shit you niggas tryna do
I could call that lil bitch if I wanted to
Baby let's have some fun, we leaving with a few

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Baby let's have some fun, I wanna fuck on your crew
Extendo on my gun, shit like World War II
Living like wild animals from the zoo
Take me an orange Adderall like DS2
Spread them racks on my bed, I got loafs of bread
That bitch Hi-Tech red, give me that super head
Gunna gon' make you beg, down for the dick you spread
Balmain cover my legs, no I ain't rocking no mags
Hope you get out your feelings, go and get in your bag
Bet you keep your semi, ain't no going out sad
Ice all over my body, it's just like an ice attack
Like my drip so they copy, shit like Simon Says
Umm, I ride that Rolls, yeah
Umm, didn't sell my soul, yeah
Umm, designer clothes, yeah
Umm, buy out the store, hey

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
I couldn't even trust the bitch if I wanted to
Niggas be cappin', talking about what they gonna do
Dripping in designer like Zoboomafoo
Probably fucking on his bitch, no he ain't got a clue
She probably swear to God that she won't lie to you
Already doin' the shit you niggas tryna do
I could call that lil bitch if I wanted to
Baby let's have some fun, we leaving with a few

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Stop drop and roll, baby just get on your knees
I made her [?] hard and she be begging me please
And she be screaming my name, I just came back from Belize
They know I'm riding with loads, poppin' like sesame seeds
We in LA in the hills, Neimans you know what it is
My bitch ass fat and it's real
Don't want that drank, it ain't sealed
I'm on her ass like some brake lights, she like that dick in the rear
Bring her ass back like a pimp, think I can't trust her for real

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
I couldn't even trust the bitch if I wanted to
Niggas be cappin', talking about what they gonna do
Dripping in designer like Zoboomafoo
Probably fucking on his bitch, no he ain't got a clue
She probably swear to God that she won't lie to you
Already doin' the shit you niggas tryna do
I could call that lil bitch if I wanted to
Baby let's have some fun, we leaving with a few
