[Intro: Euro Gotit]
Yeah, yeah yeah, Maybach black, uh, look
Maybach black (Maybach black, Maybach black)
Yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Euro Gotit]
Maybach black, play that back, throw that back, Kodak that
Take a pic, take that dick, take dick, Kodak that
Grab the cam, bands from scams, I hit the Gram, Kodak that
Get the fuck out my face, I'ma hop in a Wraith when I beat a new case, Kodak that
Yeah, Kodak that, Kodak, Kodak that
Kodak that, Kodak, Kodak that
Grab the cam, bands from scams, I hit the Gram, Kodak that
Get the fuck out my face, I'ma hop in a Wraith when I beat a new case, Kodak that

[Verse 1: Euro Gotit]
Whoa, hold up, this ain't Promethazine, homie this Act
Fuck up the club, we don't know how to act
I 'ppreciate your business but you can't come back
Wanna kill me, tell 'em aim for the back
Twenty-two hundred for a pack
Pitbull move with the pack, broke nigga move to the back
I can make moves with these racks, head to the mall with these racks
I got a tool on the dash, don't even be doin' the dash
I drop a two in a bag, then put a new coupe in the back
I had to humble me just to put Givenchy on my new rags
I just let these haters see how I live so I don't gotta brag
Shawty be callin' me daddy, my girl can't know I ain't a dad
They ask me Euro how the hell you cop a coupe that just got some titties but don't got no ass?
I got shawty on the jet, you vibe in the back
Even my son got a check, joy diamonds on my S
Don't even know what to do next, I'm a billion dollar wreck

[Chorus: Euro Gotit]
Maybach black, play that back, throw that back, Kodak that
Take a pic, take that dick, take dick, Kodak that
Grab the cam, bands from scams, I hit the Gram, Kodak that
Get the fuck out my face, I'ma hop in a Wraith when I beat a new case, Kodak that
Yeah, Kodak that, Kodak, Kodak that
Kodak that, Kodak, Kodak that
Grab the cam, bands from scams, I hit the Gram, Kodak that
Get the fuck out my face, I'ma hop in a Wraith when I beat a new case, Kodak that

[Verse 2: Gunna]
This money it long, I'ma need me a ruler, I'm makin' it stretch
Cop the Skydweller to make my life better, these flawless baguettes
I tote a Beretta, I don't sip the yellow, I only want red
I copped me a cute lil bitch out the ghetto then took her to Saks
I went to bed thinkin' 'bout money, I'm chasin' these racks
Young Gunna, don't love me, got hundreds and hundreds in stash
I copped the new Rover, it's over, these fuck niggas mad
I stay geekin' up, I ain't sober, I pop me an addy
Bought a trench jacket 'cause my bag
Pull up at the light, drop the top, Young Gunna got a bag
Spend a nick or dime in the mall when my dog come home from the can
VVS ice my neck, my wrist, these diamonds gon' dance

[Chorus: Euro Gotit]
Maybach black, play that back, throw that back, Kodak that
Take a pic, take that dick, take dick, Kodak that
Grab the cam, bands from scams, I hit the Gram, Kodak that
Get the fuck out my face, I'ma hop in a Wraith when I beat a new case, Kodak that
Yeah, Kodak that, Kodak, Kodak that
Kodak that, Kodak, Kodak that
Grab the cam, bands from scams, I hit the Gram, Kodak that
Get the fuck out my face, I'ma hop in a Wraith when I beat a new case, Kodak that
