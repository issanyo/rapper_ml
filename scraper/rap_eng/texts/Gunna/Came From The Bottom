[Hook: Lil Duke]
Came from the bottom they said we wouldn't make and we gonna show em'
Now I be sellin' out shows and they turnin' up when we perform
Look at me now, just look at me now bitch I'm on
Ride with my niggas if they right or wrong
And I'm geeked up poured a deuce in the John
Niggas be acting these niggas ain't realer than me
Ran that shit up got my niggas with me
Robbed on yo ass like I rode on the beat
Leave yo ass dead in the street
Nowadays I just want money
Remember them days I was out there with nothing
It's fuck the police and I ain't doin' no cuffin'
She sucked my dick and gave me a concussion

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
Now I'm in the foreign right now saucin' drop-top with no shoes on
And we not planning on losing
Don't play with your life you gon' lose it
Poured a whole four in the Fanta I came from Atlanta I ride with them hammers
I probably fucked all the dancers I ran up that money they know that we ballin' like [?]
I coulda been fucked that bih but I turned that bih down
[?] he with me, been runnin' the town
Run off with that work than I'm gunnnin' him down
She only squirt when I'm coming around
Move like a king where the fuck is my crown
You try to compete you might fuck round and drown
Been have the weight we been runnin' through pounds
Jugg all the work we the talk of the town
Chillin' it ain't never bosses around
You can't live my life but you talkin' about it
She want Chanel just to walk around
I been had lost my heart in lost and found
I got the mojo like Austin Powers
Kill a fuck nigga than send him some flowers
I'm geeked up right now and I'm high as a tower
I'm tryna win and make my momma prouder

[Hook: Lil Duke]
Came from the bottom they said we wouldn't make and we gonna show em'
Now I be sellin' out shows and they turnin' up when we perform
Look at me now, just look at me now bitch I'm on
Ride with my niggas if they right or wrong
And I'm geeked up poured a deuce in the John
Niggas be acting these niggas ain't realer than me
Ran that shit up got my niggas with me
Robbed on yo ass like I rode on the beat
Leave yo ass dead in the street
Nowadays I just want money
Remember them days I was out there with nothing
It's fuck the police and I ain't doin' no cuffin'
She sucked my dick and gave me a concussion

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Just came home from touring now I wanna go cop a Maserati
I only whip foreign whips got a foreign bitch she so exotic
I made it out the hood I'mma go take a flight overseas my prime
We ain't packin' no bag gotta whole lotta bands
Touch down, know we shoppin'
Better stay down with your brother
Hella down we can grind with eachother
Keep our mind on eachother
[?] niggas change like the weather
Said gotta whole lotta pain
Pour me up my pain I'mma start feelin' better
I got you covered like a sweater
I'mma do this shit forever

[Hook: Lil Duke]
