[Intro: Gunna]
I just left the lot, I bought a new Jag
Come check out my bitch, she got Chanel swag
I look in my bag, I got some blue cash

[Chorus: Gunna & Shad da God]
I just left the lot, I got a new Jag
Go check out my bitch, she got Chanel swag
I look in my bag, I got some blue cash
Karats in my wrist and she like, "I just wanna see them
I just wanna touch on you, your Backwoods look like three grams"
Rose gold [?]
Flexing with that Hitech, bitch
Trap out that spot, that's DrugRixh
Plug fare, that's Hoodrich

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Flexing too hard, fucked up my torso
Fucked in her mouth, she got that sore throat
Balmain boots, jeans, and a fur coat
Thugging immigrant, you know me with pure croat
Juuging, they come with a barcode
I won't slip over the wire like Marlow
I put your bitch in my bio
We pouring up lean like it's Cinco de Mayo
Foreign red bitch, just like the Hitech
I can't fuck unless the pussy wet
I got some snakes on my shoes
I got a hundred in jewels
I got her wet like a cruise
I got a 20, all blues
Born to win, we'll never lose
Pouring up lean I got the juice

[Chorus: Gunna & Shad da God]
I just left the lot, I bought a new Jag
Go check out my bitch, she got Chanel swag
I look in my bag, I got some blue cash
Karats in my wrist and she like, "I just wanna see them
I just wanna touch on you, your Backwoods look like three grams"
Rose gold [?]
Flexing with that Hitech, bitch
Trap out that spot, that's DrugRixh
Plug fare, that's Hoodrich

[Verse 2: YSL Duke]
Dress and I drip in Chanel
Giving these broke niggas hell
I want a rack, fuck a jail
Sipping on drink, I'm moving like a snail
Bitch, I was 18 years old with a bale
Niggas get caught by the law, they gon' tell
Came out that jungle, I run with them shottas, for real
All of my niggas, they worried 'bout a M
Been lifting weight, but don't be in no gym
Riding in the backseat, but I'm in a recliner
I changed her up, put my bitch in Designer
Bitch, I'm not stressing, I'm chasing this check
She wanna fuck, but I only want neck
Can't only fuck me, gotta run through the set
Late for the show, so we hopped on a jet
I just been running it up
I was so down on my luck
Now, bitch, I'm up

[Chorus: Gunna & Shad da God]
I just left the lot, I bought a new Jag
Go check out my bitch, she got Chanel swag
I look in my bag, I got some blue cash
Karats in my wrist and she like, "I just wanna see them
I just wanna touch on you, your Backwoods look like three grams"
Rose gold [?]
Flexing with that Hitech, bitch
Trap out that spot, that's DrugRixh
Plug fare, that's Hoodrich

[Outro: Gunna]
I just left the lot, I got a new Jag
Go check out my bitch, she got Chanel swag
I look in my bag, I got some blue cash
