[Intro]
Playmakers

[Chorus: Gunna]
Fuck it let's pour up a 8 (let's pour up a 8)
I get them racks outta state
I'm on another wave (another wave)
Got a check in a checkerboard case
Park the foreigns in back of the gate
Pop my shit and I'ma pop at your face
Got on all of my ice, I'ma skate
We goin' [?]
And its the price you gon' pay
We get geeked up like back in the day
Bitch come fuck the circle an get paid
You can't get close to the safe
50 racks on a AP today
I smoke on that shit from L.A
Stack that shit up and stay out the way (stay out the way)

[Verse 1: Gunna & Lil Duke]
Aye, yay, I gotta ride with the semi
These niggas still penny pinching
Shoot out that five till its empty
It's just me and Lil Duke in the Bentley
Know a lot of you niggas ain't with me
You get shot for some shit you ain't mean it
I'm a boss and my bitch is the meanest
And I put it on Sixties
Stunting on all my ex bitches
He got a check but we rich
Run up that sack got me filthy
I got that shit out the mud
Sipping and toastin' them drugs
I did this shit with no plug
Chasing outside the show for a hug
Bout to fly back overseas
I don't wanna fuck bitch I just want some knees
Bad bitch she just came in from Belize
I keep the cake and cuffing these freaks
We sip the lean and we don't drink no beer
YSL takeover yeah this our year
Flexing these diamonds got too many carats
I fucked yo bitch 'cause she know I'ma savage

[Chorus: Gunna]
Fuck it let's pour up a 8 (let's pour up a 8)
I get them racks outta state
I'm on another wave (another wave)
Got a check in a checkerboard case
Park the foreigns in back of the gate
Pop my shit and I'ma pop at your face
Got on all of my ice, I'ma skate
We go [?]
And its the price you gon' pay
We get geeked up like back in the day
Bitch come fuck the circle an get paid
You can't get close to the safe
50 racks on a AP today
I smoke on that shit from L.A
Stack that shit up and stay out the way (stay out the way)

[Verse 2: Gunna & Shad Da God]
Aye, hey, hey, ain't telling no facades
Gimme another m√©nage
Fat ass like Nicki Minaj
I sleep over with Shad da God
'Cause we from the other side
Take these pictures no never mind
You know real niggas recognize
(GOD!) Pull up, muddy! (Skrrt!)
Audemar wrist, flooded! (Water!)
Big bankroll on me, I go 6:30 (Bankroll!)
He say pull up with some clean
I pull up with some Kid Cudi (Skr, Raw!)
Been havin' actavis tech
Been havin' actavis [?] (Act, Act)
Slow it down lil God you fucking up all yo money (slow it down!)
Pulled up at that Magic and left that 6 trey runnin' (in the street)
Pouring percs and red on these bitches (Hi-Tech!!!)
Bitch sittin' on them Benz seats I'm never itching (GOD!)

[Chorus: Gunna]
Fuck it let's pour up a 8 (let's pour up a 8)
I get them racks outta state
I'm on another wave (another wave)
Got a check in a checkerboard case
Park the foreigns in back of the gate
Pop my shit and I'ma pop at your face
Got on all of my ice, I'ma skate
We goin' [?]
And its the price you gon' pay
We get geeked up like back in the day
Bitch come fuck the circle an get paid
You can't get close to the safe
50 racks on a AP today
I smoke on that shit from L.A
Stack that shit up and stay out the way (stay out the way)
