Lil shawty on fye
I need her on my side
Stuff my Backwood get high
Complimenting my fly
I’m dat nigga dat guy
Fashion Week in NY
Double C like a spy
She put double C on her eye
All of these corners sharp might wreck da Bentley in the hills (skrrt skrrt)
My bitches coming dressed to kill
I fuck for hours off a pill
Don’t hit my hoe up just to chill
I swear my life come wit a bill
I never had a bitch to keep it real
So baby let’s take a trip out to Brazil (out the way)

[Verse]
Baby let’s go far
I don’t do slow cars
Wedding cake in my wood ain’t no gars

These niggas got no heart [no heart]
I been built for this shit from the start
She got a good head.... smart
Cuff like a cop I’m Paul Blart

Cause I’m in the mood for that [my vibes]
She get in her mood fast
I’m in love wit her rude ass

She act like da manager make sure da kid neva late
I hope he don’t get outta pocket cause we neva run out of k’s
Private plane, private plane baby we don’t do delays
I’m missin yo face, I ain’t seen u in some days

Came from Wing Bonz  now we eat NoBu now
I stunt on my old boo now
These niggas watching me like roku now
