[Intro]
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Chorus]
I rock Balmains, swerve in all lanes
Don't play no games, ain't no joke
I don't do no hating, ain't got no main
Let that clip hang, got that pole
I rock Balmains, ain't no joke (ain't no joke)
I rock Palm Angels, ain't no joke (ain't no joke)
I might road rage, swerve in all lanes
With my gang gang, 'til I'm gone ('til I'm gone), yeah

[Verse 1]
Got gas like Amaco, hey
Count this cash, I got more, hey
Don't need no flash, lightning bolts, hey
Smash, I got racks in the dashboard (dashboard)
I boarded a jet without my passport (passport)
Had to cut my ties, you a bad source (a bad source)
Informant ass nigga, working task force (task force)
Yeah I got racks ho
And we'll pass a ho, she want a young Metro
Baby girl got the best throat
Bitch we going in beast mode
I land in Heathrow
Please keep my lean cold
Givenchy lens (lens)
I don't see you cheap hoes
Sixty five Benz, yeah this the big bro
It cost me ten, I got three pedals
With my new rare clothes, I'm drippin' Rick O, oh oh

[Chorus]
I rock Balmains, swerve in all lanes
Don't play no games, ain't no joke
I don't do no hating, ain't got no main
Let that clip hang, got that pole
I rock Balmains, ain't no joke (ain't no joke)
I rock Palm Angels, ain't no joke (ain't no joke)
I might road rage, swerve in all lanes
With my gang gang, 'til I'm gone ('til I'm gone), yeah

[Verse 2]
My bitch got cameltoe, hey
Sweet like cantaloupe, hey
Got my back from off the ropes, hey
Live inside the bank, make the deposit though
Why the hell you sign with Boominati dawg?
Snatch me a new coupe, I got it polished though
Mansion in LA, shit look like Mally Mal
Ayy I ball, young nigga ball
Stand on hundreds tall, fuck up the shopping mall
Drippin', I left you the sauce
Puttin' them racks in the vault
I heard you was playing with the sauce
We rich and we big as the law
Trust me I'm keeping it raw
My brother be peeping you out
Trust my dog with a paw
Cut in the game with a saw
Pour up and just fuck what it cost
Yeah, this water like Voss
Yeah, your ho will get tossed
Money done made me a boss

[Chorus]
I rock Balmains, swerve in all lanes
Don't play no games, ain't no joke
I don't do no hating, ain't got no main
Let that clip hang, got that pole
I rock Balmains, ain't no joke (ain't no joke)
I rock Palm Angels, ain't no joke (ain't no joke)
I might road rage, swerve in all lanes
With my gang gang, 'til I'm gone ('til I'm gone), yeah
