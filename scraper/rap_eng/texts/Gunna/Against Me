[Chorus]
I stack up them racks, I stacked up them riches
Got racks in my pocket, got racks for my bitches
I jumped off the porch, know how to get it
The differences is, lil' nigga I listen
I ain’t tryna sign, I'ma stay independent
Now open your eyes, hope you pay attention
I copped me a coupe and it come wit' no ceilin'
I used to struggle 'til I started dealin'
I gotta hustle to get me a million
You in the way nigga, play your position
Keep a straight face, I don't play wit' these bitches
Keep a AK, 'bout to blow in the kitchen
I might make the Forbes from tourin' the city
When I go to the hood niggas actin' like bitches
I gotta stay focused, my enemies envy
I know you ain't wit' me, you niggas against me

[Verse 1]
I know you ain't wit' me (I know you ain't wit' me)
I turned to the lord, I know you against me
Try to avoid and roll me a spiffy
But these niggas tellin', I smell somethin' fishy
I can't sell a brick 'cause I think it's too ricky
If I sell a band then my shotta gon' get me
I'm still of Pro-bell and my shit cost a milly
Wake up in the mornin' and think about Benji's
I went to the bank and I'm settin' up commas
To tell you the truth, I'm in love wit' blue hunnids
These bitches gon' [?] when they see the young Gunna
I just got a Slatt and she came from [?]
She sucked me so good got a flight to Atlanta
These bitches get money, you know it don't matter
Went straight to the top and I didn't use a ladder
Got choppas on choppas if you wanna battle
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I go to the mall and buy my bit' designer
'Cause she kept it silent I know she a rider
Go back to the spot, put the dick all inside of you
You niggas be cuffin', hell, I know you can't hide it
I know she gon' [?] 'cause I made a deposit
We [?] to my music, she say I'm melodic
Remember you had it, now nigga I got it


[Chorus]
I stack up them racks, I stacked up them riches
Got racks in my pocket, got racks for my bitches
I jumped off the porch, know how to get it
The differences is, lil' nigga I listen
I ain’t tryna sign, I'ma stay independent
Now open your eyes, hope you pay attention
I caught me a coupe and it come wit' no ceilin'
I used to struggle 'til I started dealin'
I gotta hustle to get me a million
You in the way nigga, play your position
Keep a straight face, I don't play wit' these bitches
Keep a AK, 'bout to blow in the kitchen
I might make the Forbes from tourin' the city
When I go to the hood niggas actin' like bitches
I gotta stay focused, my enemies envy
I know you ain't wit' me, you niggas against me

[Verse 2]
You niggas against me
You niggas don't feel me or wit' me at all
I'm tryna go up and they want me to fall
You niggas some ballhogs, don't want me to ball
I still got some sandwiches waitin' on the call
I do a prayer and my money stand tall
Pourin' the Act' in that red [?]
I'm feelin' like 2Pac and it's [?] the law
Cash out on a foreign, I don't care what it cost
It came wit' a horse, she hit it wit' Voss
I got me a check, went and bought me a loft
I'm a young boss, made it outta the South
Nigga gon' hate, keep my name outta your mouth
These niggas show fake love when they see me out
They know I'm workin' when they in a drought
[?] had me workin' the couch
[?] had me workin' the mansion
And I like my loyalty, said baby don't pay me
I heard you got a [?] in the safe and the attic
They keep it cool and then all be dramatic
Whatever I showed you, you need to forget it
She can get prices on a dealer wit' business
I just want work and change up, filthy riches

[Chorus]
I stack up them racks, I stacked up them riches
Got racks in my pocket, got racks for my bitches
I jumped off the porch, know how to get it
The differences is, lil' nigga I listen
I ain’t tryna sign, I'ma stay independent
Now open your eyes, hope you pay attention
I copped me a coupe and it come wit' no ceilin'
I used to struggle 'til I started dealin'
I gotta hustle to get me a million
You in the way nigga, play your position
Keep a straight face, I don't play wit' these bitches
Keep a AK, 'bout to blow in the kitchen
I might make the Forbes from tourin' the city
When I go to the hood niggas actin' like bitches
I gotta stay focused, my enemies envy
I know you ain't wit' me, you niggas against me
