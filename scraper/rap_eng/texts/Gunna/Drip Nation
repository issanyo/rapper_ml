[Chorus: Gunna]
Just keep it real 'cause these niggas be fakin'
I ran it up now I drip 'cross the nation
Gelato I'm blazin', sell hoes like it's Vegas
PJ different places, Rolex with no patience
Keep it real with me, I hope you ain't fakin'
Ran that shit up, now we drip 'cross the nation
Gelato I'm blazin', sell hoes like it's Vegas
Rolex with no patience, PJ different places

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Ah, Megabus, I got my drip back from Houston
Made it back home, this shit wasn't a movie
Poured a whole eight and I ain't feelin' woozy
I'm a real one and you already knew it
Fucked on a groupie, Young Gunna the coolest
YSL latest, stay rockin' the newest
Swap Gucci with Fendi, I really be moody
I don't really talk but I speak through my music
Pop an X pill and nigga I'm booted
House in the hills, do it look like we losin'?
Ain't got no deal but my fans say I do it
I crack a seal and pour up in my soda
My cup runneth over, don't like bein' sober
Used to pull up and make plays at the Mobil
Used to skip school and we wasn't even mobil
Slatt, Young Gunna slime like a cobra
I fuck with Drip Sosa, ice cold like a polar
Still gon' get money when this shit is over
DMG goin' all up my motors
Count that shit up, got them racks off of yola
My plug is a grower, I love sippin' oil
I got a backend, I'm still seein' more
It ain't no Cali, Young Gunna is law

[Chorus: Gunna]
Just keep it real 'cause these niggas be fakin'
I ran it up now I drip 'cross the nation
Gelato I'm blazin', sell hoes like it's Vegas
PJ different places, Rolex with no patience
Keep it real with me, I hope you ain't fakin'
Ran that shit up, now we drip 'cross the nation
Gelato I'm blazin', sell hoes like it's Vegas
Rolex with no patience, PJ different places

[Verse 2: Sosamann]
My drip is amazin', they all want to take it
I fly different places, kill shit like I'm raidin'
Got lyrics like Jason, big gat what I'm facin'
I just broke an agent, she sound real taken
It's hell what I'm raisin' if they try to play me
Ride with these K's like I am a racist
The Gucci I'm rockin', you know it's the latest, yeah
I fuck with Young Gunna, I put that on hundreds, that's just how we bomin'
Big diamonds, big money, big drippin' on somethin'
Big clip that's a drummin', it hit you like thunder, yeah, ayy
I get to the numbers, I come from the dungeon
I whip tail a foreign, I'm doin' a hundred
I'm stone cold like Stunna
My watch is included, we don't care 'bout a bundle, yeah
I'm settin' my mood
I'm strapped with the tool and I'm strapped with the jewel
My diamonds they hit hard like a high dude
And tipped a lil bitch in Chanel, bought some boots
I'm thinkin' 'bout trip 'round the world with my crew
Might go Peru, got sauce, you can't lose
Reppin' that red and countin' them blues
I get to this bread and stack up the loot

[Chorus: Gunna]
Just keep it real 'cause these niggas be fakin'
I ran it up now I drip 'cross the nation
Gelato I'm blazin', sell hoes like it's Vegas
PJ different places, Rolex with no patience
Keep it real with me, I hope you ain't fakin'
Ran that shit up, now we drip 'cross the nation
Gelato I'm blazin', sell hoes like it's Vegas
Rolex with no patience, PJ different places
