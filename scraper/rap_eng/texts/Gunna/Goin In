[Chorus]
I will never ever switch
I stopped and watch 'em take a pic
I put some icing on my wrist
My Forgiato blowing kiss, lips
I hit the club and threw a 10
She know I know I'm goin' in
Got Tom Ford on my lens
A Don Juan like a pimp, bitch

[Verse 1]
Got 60 shows a nigga goin' in
They sent me to front with a back end
World tour, I'm picking up a 10
We run up that sack when they pack in
You wanna send it, better mail it straight
I could show you, let me demonstrate
Saran wrap it like a dinner plate
You got the truck and I'mma check the date
Get there early, not a minute late
Bust it open, smoke it, meditate
That lean is something I can never waste
That Iley Miley got a bitter taste
We been pouring syrup in a Minute Maid
We far from white but we got plenty K's
We blow this shit up, we the renegade
I bought a house and then went renovate it
My side bitch wanna have a baby
I fuck her good and give her penetration
We fucking smoking, we need ventilation
I'm rocking ice, a nigga really skating
I'm rapping focused, nigga dedicated
I brought the show, look like a masquerade
Shut this shit down like the Central Station

[Chorus]
I will never ever switch
I stopped and watch 'em take a pic
I put some icing on my wrist
My Forgiato blowing kisses, lips
I hit the club and threw a 10
She know I know I'm goin' in
Got Tom Ford on my lens
A Don Juan like a pimp, bitch

[Verse 2]
I know, I know, I know, I know I'm goin'
I know, I know, I know I keep 'em flowing
I open words and now I speak influence
I'm a boss, I got a strong influence
I went got my chance, I'm a opportunist
I tuck the Glock, nigga not the Ruger
Got 30 shots and nigga I'm the shooter
I put my jewelry in a fucking cooler
I whipped the Benz and then I whipped the Beamer
I told her pick my clothes up at the cleaners
She walk and toot it like a ballerina
She bad as fuck, a nigga barely see her
She shop at Houston in the Galleria
I send her once inside the Beverly Hills
She try take my wallet and spend a mil'
I keep it silent I never tell
I came out that dope hole to give em' hell
Tell me what you want, I got it for sell
When I was 11 I seen a bale
Go 'head run that pack all the way
I copped me some work when I got a scale
And I found a plug in LA
I told him we sendin' it in the mail

[Chorus]
I will never ever switch
I stopped and watch 'em take a pic
I put some icing on my wrist
My Forgiato blowing kisses, lips
I hit the club and threw a 10
She know I know I'm goin' in
Got Tom Ford on my lens
A Don Juan like a pimp, bitch
