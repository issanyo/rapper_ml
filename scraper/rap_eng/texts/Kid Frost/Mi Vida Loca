[Intro Dialogue]
Hey vato, that shit was pretty dope, A!
But uh, kick another rola for the homeboys, A!
Kid Frost: *tsk* Alright look man. I'm gonna kick the first verse
But for the rest of this shit man you're gonna have to wait for hour three loco
Mi Vida Loca!

[Rich Garcia]
Listen, listen

[Verse 1: Kid Frost]
Mi vida loca, my crazy life
And as I describe how crazy my life is
Or should I say my life before
I opened the doors
To the world of show biz
I was a troubled kid
I never gave a second thought to the things I did
Quick to get up off on them fools who run up
Down for any situation that would come up
Zero tolerance which means I put up with nada
I'm rolling on the boulevard with the raza
If you were cool, I was cool, cool
Trip, I gotta act the fool
School you quicker than your school teacher
No split decision I straight cold beat ya
With bare hands I grab you around your throat and choke ya
Don't mess with my crazy life, mi vida loca
My crazy life
At the age of twelve I started packing a knife
Back then, gangbanging was all but fun
At the age of fourteen I started packing a gun
It was a .32 Berretta
And there was no way in hell that I would ever let a
Dumb punk sissy start talking smack
Or work with a smirk and peel this cap
Quicker than your ass could peel an orange
Give me a reason any reason little boy it's on
It's like that I'm not afraid to provoke ya
My crazy life, mi vida loca
(Listen) Mi vida loca (Listen, listen, listen)

[Verse 2: Rich Garcia]
Chicano groove, latin thang
Make you move, make you sing, la vida
So let's keep it cool, don't you know
Ghetto band, chicano soul, la vida
Listen
