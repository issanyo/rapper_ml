[Verse 1: Wreck]
I'm lying on the mother fucking floor
Bleeding
Holes in my lungs from the bullets
I stop breathing
Bright lights flashing
I can see them from the floor
That ugly mother fucker from my nightmares in the dark
I'm seeing all them niggas I done killed in the past
He is [?] at the top with a crazy ass mask, and he is telling me
"welcome to your brand new home, for your ass an eternal fire you must roam."
I'm thinking "Oh shit this must be hell"
And I remember our mentor talking about repenting in my cell
I don't give no fuck because I know I had no choices
It went down like that because I kept listening to the voices

And still those voices are calling from far away

The demons the serpents and all the shadows and the flames
All the screaming from the far will make us all go insane

[hook: Nino Brown]
I'm lost in your world of violence and hate
Cause everything I love you have taken away
Now tell me what the fuck am i supposed to do or say
When its one love to live and then we all hit the grave
When I leave the world on my finishing day
I hope the lord receives me and opens the gate
Will I run with the world ill be on my way
Kiss the sky goodbye and ill be on my way
