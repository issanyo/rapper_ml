Baby.. I can give you the world..
Baby baby baby - even diamonds and pearls
Do you want it?
Been around the world once, met every girl twice
Never seen nobody that was so damn tight
None of them come close to you
I'm bouts to take you on a rendezvous
Let me set you out with platinum ice
Give me all that sugar and spice
Take a chance with me, roll the dice
So let's step baby, live the life
Baby, you got me feelin all shy
Got a stomach full of butterflies
Wanna get down, but not on the first night
Nigga tight, got five on the gas
Can I ride with you? Wanna be your Boo
Like the things you do
Wanna take it slow when I do the do witchu
Can't no other girl do what I'm about to do to you
Way SexyCool
Baby.. (baby)
I can give you the world (ooh give you the world)
Baby baby baby (ooh baby) even diamonds and pearls
Do you want it?
Let me lick it up and down (all up and down)
Let me see you move that body round and round (all around)
Baby now let me know if you're really down (oh really down)
C'mon let me know if you want it (oh yea I want it)
Give you the world, and everything in it
Diamonds and pearls, my world so exquisite
P&J Polo with the the chain to match
Cartier no strings attached
Be my lady I'll rub your back
Need a Benz? I'll pay for that
Keep it comin girl, turn me on
And we gon' sex til the break of dawn
It's a match, not a mismatch
Want you to get attached to the black cat
I can look into your eyes and see you want that
I ain't nuttin like the next biatch
Let me show you where my head at
Shotgun in an Northstar Cadillac
Sweet black diamond hit it from the back Jack
Ooh baby, youse a star
Break me off a piece of that Kit-Kat bar
Baby.. (babyyyy)
I can give you the world (ooh give you the world)
Baby baby baby (baby baby baby baby) even diamonds and pearls
Do you want it?
Let me lick it up and down (all up and down)
Let me see you move that body round and round (all around)
Baby now let me know if you're really down (I'm so down)
C'mon let me know if you want it (yea I want it)
You want me, bring it over now
Take my clothes off Mista Baby hit the ground
Hear that clappin sound?
Time for me to break you down
Be cryin in my nicky now
Make your head spin round and round
When I first met you you had a frown
But look at you now, got a big smile on your face
Wanna take me place to place
Dip me down in satin and lace
Fancy clothes and diamond rings
Are the things that money do
Cheap wine, Moet, and Cristal
Apartment houses to the penthouse
Cover me in fur from the neck to my toes
While I postpone when the nights is cold
Dedicate you a cut on the radio
Bout to put this love thang into cruise control
Give it to me girl damelo
Penthouse is the Vallagio
Plushed out with the matchin robes
Celeb jet when it's time to roll
Big ball and that's all I know
V.I.P. that's how I G
Versace that's all I see
Me and you we was meant to be
Do a show bout a quarter to ten
Take your keys to the Range or Benz
You can floss, bring all your friends
Ain't nuttin but a money thing, major ends
Backstage and it's off the hook
All my homies is G's and crooks
Suited up and the party's live
Diamonds and pearls, won't you step into my world
Baby.. (baby)
I can give you the world (come on and give me the world)
Baby baby baby (ooh baby) even diamonds and pearls
Do you want it?
Let me lick it up and down
Let me see you move that body round and round
Baby now let me know if you're really down
C'mon let me know if you want it
Yeah
