[Verse 1: A.L.T.]
I got the county flu or is it just a sinus
9500, pimp house slipping at it's finest
Give me a sign and I'll give you a rhythm
I got my hands in my pockets and I'm following the red line
Thinking about weed and boozes
And now I wanna cruise but I'm stuck in these wrinkled ass gloots
But that's the way it goes
Slapping dominoes and jacking peckawood for the pet roles
But I was climb back, man I couldn't see
My name is A.L.T. but they call me 0.7.3
In and out of tents waiting for my release
Role them up so I tell my homeboys peace
Thinking I got a warrant, they'll be stopping me soon
Hoping that I make it to the property room
So I can hit the I-10 eastbound
Thinking to myself, "A.L.T., you really got to slow down."

[Hook: Kid Frost & JV]
Slow down because you're moving to fasten
You got to make the moment lasten

Slow down because you're moving to fasten
You got to make the moment lasten

Slow your role baby
Slow your role baby
Slow your role, you're moving much too fast

Slow your role baby
Slow your role baby
Slow your role, you're moving much too fast

[Verse 2: JV]
Nowadays life for the street for a teen ain't
Nothing like 17 magazine and
I had a friend name Trish off the block
And she messed around and got hooked on the rock
Cocaine and mama use to call her plain Jane
Now she's living life in the fast lane
I try to help her out but it's very scary
And in the street, dictionary, she's a strawberry
Purple lips and pale face
And the second, I'm too sure she'll be gone without no trace
While the white scientist is in the lab
Making new drugs, she's in pod on some rehab
But I just sit in the bench on the sideline
Fronting what I see about Ross about white line
As the keys get broken in the pound
All I got to say about that is slow down

[Hook: Kid Frost & JV]
Slow down because you're moving to fasten
You got to make the moment lasten

Slow down because you're moving to fasten
You got to make the moment lasten

Slow your role baby
Slow your role baby
Slow your role, you're moving much too fast

Slow your role baby
Slow your role baby
Slow your role, you're moving much too fast

[Verse 3: Kid Frost]
My daddy taught me all about birds and bees
But pot taught me about pounds and keys
And so I know a thing or two about the hood
And every youngers up to no good
I hit cross for help but they wait fake
Hey yo, the eses on the wall, if you read between the spray paint
But if you can't read graffiti
It's a pity what's going on through the inner city
Young girls are getting knocked up
While daddy's locked up in west side getting socked up
And nowadays every corner got their trap type
And they be looking at life through a glass pipe
And if you're asking me why does it have to be this way
Hey yo, Frost is in town telling you what you got to is slow down

[Outro Hook: Kid Frost & JV]
Slow down because you're moving to fasten
You got to make the moment lasten

Slow down because you're moving to fasten
You got to make the moment lasten

Slow your role baby
Slow your role baby
Slow your role, you're moving much too fast

Slow your role baby
Slow your role baby
Slow your role, you're moving much too fast

Slow down baby, slow down
Slow down baby, slow down

Slow down baby, slow down
Slow down baby, slow down

Slow down baby, slow down
Slow down baby, slow down
Slow down baby, slow down
Slow down baby, slow down

Slow down baby, (Slow down) Slow down

(Slow down, slow down) Slow down
(Slow down, slow down) Slow down
(Slow down, slow down, slow down)
(Slow down...)
