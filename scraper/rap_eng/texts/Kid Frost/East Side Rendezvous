[Verse 1: Frost]
I just woke up, thank God it's Friday
Fire up the lac and hit the highway
Pulled in the car wash, so we can hit them whitewall tires
Sedan DeVille sitting on L.A. Wires
And it's got to be 80 degrees
I got a check in my pocket for fifteen G's
Hit the first interstate, now I'm straight
Stop at the record store to pick me up an old school tape
Back in my ride, see the spin of the tires
Kid Frost rolling, bumping Earth, Wind, & Fire
It feels good holding fifteen grand
So I parked the Sedan and I strolled into Greenspans
Give me a pair of your 50-30s
Cascades, Cortez and a jet-black hoodie
Headed back home and got G'd-up, fool
It's an eastside rendezvous, yeah yeah

[Hook: Diane Gordon]
Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them OG's do

Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them gangstas do

[Verse 2: O.G. Enius]
Now, who be that brand new daddy of the year
I swear; baby, we gonna take you there
It's me, that eastside G y'all never heard of
With A.L.T. and them folks getting much love
Through the neighborhoods, through the city
Woofers in the back bumping 'do-wah-ditty', yeah
Drop a line to them hookers for their info
Pack them smokes, LA capping with their khacks low
Cause we some true players, bandits
Got them hynas at the hotel and they can't stand it
I got that sexual healing on them
36-double-deuce-36 and I'm feeling on them
Ooh-eee, I see, she got it going on like a true Miss G
But I'm a stay true P-I-M-P from the eastside

[Hook]
Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them OG's do

Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them gangstas do

[Verse 3: A.L.T.]
Now it's Friday night and everything's alright
So just sit back, relax and enjoy the flight
It's A.L.T. hitting corners in the 63
And I'm straight rendezvous-in' through the SGV
As the 18's blast, pop the tape in the dash
Bumping old school fools like Teddy Pendergrass
I can feel the heat coming out from underneath my seat
I never heard the word 'defeat'
It's the middle of July, so it's hot
I think of Kid Frost, he's recording at the G Spot, fool
Frost said, "I hope the one time don't stop ya"
I don't give a damn, I'm sipping Malibu and Vodka
I'm on that San Bernardino
In the fast lane cause baby got some hynas out in Chino
And you know that I'm a G'd up fool
It's an eastside rendezvous and I'm there

[Hook]
Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them OG's do

Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them gangstas do
