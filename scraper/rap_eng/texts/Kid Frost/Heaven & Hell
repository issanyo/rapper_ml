Verse 1:
Be real with yourself
Make sure that you know
Where you gonna go
At the end of the show
When the credits start to roll
When the lights go out
When you laid up on the slab
Is what I'm talking about
There ain't no prejudice with God
If you white or black
You may walk on your feet
But you leave on your back
It isn't court
So the judge ain't cuttin no slack
No when you leave the physical
There ain't no coming back
Did you jack alot of people?
Did you mess with hoes?
Did you put that white stuff up your nose?
Now I ain't one to judge
So I ain't judging anybody
All I know that I'ma be at ease
When I leave this part
So think about your life
And make changes
Or maybe you straight
And got a ticket to that pearly gate
You see if you be non-believing
Then I say oh well but guaranteed
That you be leaving to a Heaven or Hell

Chorus:
Everybody got to die someday
Everybody gonna cry someday
Everybody find a better way
So you know
Where you gonna go
Everybody got to die someday
Everybody gonna cry someday
Everybody find a better way
So you know
Where you gonna go

Verse 2:
Last night while I was dreaming
I had a talk with Eazy
And believe me
He was real glad to see me
Where you been little homie?
And why'd you have to die?
I been shootin' dice
At that craps table in the sky
He said how are things goin' at the G spot?
Tony still gamblin
Julio slamin
Ain't nothing changin' but the zeros
Keep it up foo
You be some mexican heroes
But as I spoke to him more
Start to burn
There was change in his voice
I heard the sound of concern
The last time I seen him
Was the house of blues
He said gamble with your life
And you bound to lose Frost
I thought about the words he spoke
When they put you in the ground
He said everybody's broke
I gotta shake the spot
Cause it's time to bail
Well tell everybody
There's a Heaven & Hell

Chorus:
Everybody got to die someday
Everybody gonna cry someday
Everybody find a better way
So you know
Where you gonna go
Everybody got to die someday
Everybody gonna cry someday
Everybody find a better way
So you know
Where you gonna go

Verse 3:
Now Everybody's Asking
Who Shot 2Pac?
The Playa Fell Victim To Whose Glock?
A Question I Would Ask
But The Homie Ain't Around
Cause Somebody Put Him
6 Ft. In The Ground
Now Is There A Place For Dope Dealers In The Sky?
Is There Room For Cold Killers Who Drive-by
Now Here I Go Again
I Think I'm Dreaming
I Seen It
In A Smoke Filled Room
With Ashes & Demons
2Pac Was Struggling To Stay Alive
He Was A Playa For Life
But He Was Buried At 25
And If He Was Here
Then He Could Make It Clear
That Your Soul Don't Float Around
In The Atmosphere
Because It's Got A Destination
And God Is Who You're Facing
And If You Mess Up
Then Have A Good Explanation
If He Could Speak
He'd Have A Story To Tell
Everybody Is Going To A Heaven or Hell

Outro:
Everybody
Everybody got to die someday
Gonna cry someday
Everybody
Everybody got to die someday
Gonna cry someday
