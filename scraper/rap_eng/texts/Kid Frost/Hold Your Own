[Verse 1]
Grown up in the streets of LA
Luck that can be determined by the words you say
Been misunderstood if you're in the wrong hood
Cause then you gotta face those up to no good
Forefront, we're coming from the side
But one is running back for a gun in his ride
The sign of a...
Cock back a plaque of a Vietnam flashback
Unlike a movie, here in the streets we play for keeps
...
...that most would say is senseless
Senseless is to walk the street defenseless
And the man, he don't understand
Why sometimes you must take the law into your own hands
The city's a jungle and in the jungle you're all alone
... you gotta hold your own

[Hook repeating]
You gotta hold your own
Got to, got to
Refuse to lose

[Verse 2]
Man no matter where you live, you gotta hold your own
If you're even in a gang or you roam alone
A man's gotta do what a man's got to do
One false move and your ass is through
If you're not prepared to back yourself up
Man you better shut up or get cut up...
A dealer of drugs will have to hustle with thugs
A pimp gets paid while his girl gives hugs
Holding his own in whatever he does
Just to get back what once was
From the street ghetto ... to the rich and the wealthy
To the ones that are sick, to the ones that are healthy
...
The solution is yours, it's up to you to provide
And decide and take pride and never hide
Your true colors that you hold inside

[Hook repeating]
You gotta hold your own
Got to, got to
Refuse to lose

[Verse 3]
... get-go
You gotta let 'em know that you're down to throw
A petty (?) turned into a (?)
...
But you never really now, 'cause it's like throwing the dice
One gets away, the other gets iced
My mind is a trigger, ready to deliver
Words from the mind...
The more you can expand, the more your set can
Learn and absorb, grow together and withstand time
And pay attention to the next generation
The Latin alliance is growing throughout the nation
My hands in a fist for whatever might happen
For the... stays when I'm rappin'
Frost is back, so just let it be known
That I'm here to hold my own

[Hook repeating]
You gotta hold your own
Got to, got to
Refuse to lose
