[Intro speaks: Kid Frost]
What is time?
Time is when a man is trying to make time with your woman
But you're doing time behind bars and your time is standing still
Yo, Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?

[Verse 1]
Time, sifts through the hourglass, through night and day
And I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
And if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit
(Yeah)

I've seen the manifestations of the street
So I can manifest what I see on a drum beat
Like just last night
(Yo, what happened?)

I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
One of them was quick to pull a knife
He stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
In prison at the age of 21
(Yeah)

Living on death row cause he couldn't let go
Caught in the web of violence
(Damn)
Roll deep when they creep and move in silence of the lambs
(Yo)
A tattooed tear dropped as the iron gates slam

[Hook]
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, anytime, hey
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, anytime

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn ain't that a shame?
You lost, so pay the cost, shouldn't of played the game
Should've listen to the Frost when I was trying to come across to you
But no you didn't think
(Sucker)

You just keep getting yourself more deep until you sink
So there's no one else to thank but yourself
So go ahead take bow for a job well done
But you'll never see the day of the sunshine or the fun times

Just the old days and your old ways
Corrupt and wicked
Out there doing dirt, instead of just kicking it
Pow pow, bang bang and all that noise
(Yeah)

Yeah, you and all your homeboys
Take time to read between the lines
Cause ain't no sunshine

[Hook]
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, anytime, hey
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, anytime

[Verse 3]
(Yo, Kid)
I know about being macho
Calling the shots the big time head honcho
(Yeah)

But here's something even more gacho
One of my homeboys is your old lady's Sancho
Yo, shit happens
A number lights up on his beeper right as I'm rapping

While you sit in a cell writing a letter
Saying when you get out, your things will be better
(Right)
But man she couldn't wait so she's going out on a date

With every Tom, Dick and Harry
And if you ask me, your shit's getting scary
So how you gonna handle this
When your ho's in Los Angeles, acting so scandalous?

Yo, you can't blame her you didn't take the time
And now, ain't no sunshine

[Hook]
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, that's for you, '92
You know what I'm saying? Anytime, yeah
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, anytime, damn

So if you don't wanna do no time
You better take time to try to draw the line
You know what I'm saying?
Or you're gonna be the next fool in line doing time
You know what I'm saying? Like my man said

Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine fool
Ain't no sunshine, ain't nothing happening up there
You know what I'm saying? Ain't no sunshine, anytime
Yo, me and Frost is out of here, peace

There just ain't no sunshine
