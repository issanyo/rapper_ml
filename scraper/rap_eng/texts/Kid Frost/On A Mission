[Verse 1: Litefoot]
Now its about 5 in the mornin'
And I can hear the birds outside crowin'
Then I heard somebody at the front door
Claiming they was Crazy Horse and Geronimo
They said they got the khak suits creased down
With the ragtop 64 to the ground
I said "wassup," they said, "Wassup Litefoot, homie?"
Swear to God them fools knew everything about me
Then I got to thinkin' 'cause the shit that was going on in mind started sinkin'
I think they came back from the dead
I turned around and saw my body that was still in bed
Then I really started trippin'
They said, "Relax homeboy, we goin' on a mission
So hurry up and get ya gat and while you at it, two black hoodies with some ski masks"

[Chorus]
Rollin through the hood in a 64, dippin'
One little, two little, three crazy Indians
Creepin' through the hood in a ragtop on a mission
One little, two little, three crazy Indians
Rollin through the hood in a 64, dippin'
One little, two little, three crazy Indians
Creepin' through the hood in a ragtop on a mission
One little, two little, three crazy Indians

[Verse 2: Litefoot]
Rollin through the hood wit my heroes
But the speedometer reads zero
And at the same time we comin' through
And I can see the golden eagle through the rearview
Geronimo told me that I was chosen
And that I would lead a way for the children
Spread the words with the music then Crazy Horse
Said, "It's a gift, son, use it"
Schoolin' me about them old days
Way before there was pimped out Chevrolets
How they would fight for their life, fight for they people
And kill the paleface that was evil
No you gotta take a stand
And the day that you do is the day that you become a man
Make a name for yourself in this lifetime
And that's when you find a true peace of mind

[Chorus]
Rollin through the hood in a 64, dippin'
One little, two little, three crazy Indians
Creepin' through the hood in a ragtop on a mission
One little, two little, three crazy Indians
Rollin through the hood in a 64, dippin'
One little, two little, three crazy Indians
Creepin' through the hood in a ragtop on a mission
One little, two little, three crazy Indians

[Verse 3: Litefoot & Kid Frost]
Then the 64 turned into a caddy
Now I gotta get that big daddy
He said Frost got the remedy poppin'
And with you and him there ain't no stoppin'
Then we hit the crossroad the other way, bust a U
Now we was in LA on the east side of town
And when I looked around me
Everything was brown except for the blue khaks and the white t-shirts creased
Then I felt peace, he said
"Wassup loco, now you in the casa
And just like me foo, do it for your raza
And walk with the spirits in your soul
Just like Crazy Horse and Geronimo"
Next thing I knew, I was in my room and the clock read 10:52
Damn

[Chorus]
Rollin through the hood in a 64, dippin'
One little, two little, three crazy Indians
Creepin' through the hood in a ragtop, we on a mission
One little, two little, three crazy Indians
Rollin through the hood in a 64, dippin'
One little, two little, three crazy Indians
Creepin' through the hood in a ragtop on a mission
One little, two little, three crazy Indians
