**Frost talking**
Yea
What's up girl
I ain't seen you in a while
You looking good

Sexy lady
{I know you want me}
{I know you need me}
Sexy lady
{do you really want me, do you really need me}

[Verse One]
Can you remember when I told you that you rock my world
But you was young and you was daddy's little diamond girl
I can't forget the day when you was posted up at school
With your home girls and I was scooping up my crew
You was only seventeen and I felt a fool
Cuz seventeen could get a homie twenty-two
That couldn't stop me from having fantasy
And made me wounder, we could sail the seven seas
And I was fiending fo ya, I was dreaming fo ya
But then I heard the news you was leaving California
On the way to college for an education
And I was happy for you, gave you my congratulations
Situation under mind, we said good bye
You was the only girl to ever make me cry
Yo, if I send a dozen roses they would probably die
From all the tear drops and I can't even lie

[Chorus 2X]
Your a good girl now
Your were daddy's little girl {yes I'm ready}
Can I hold you {yes I'm ready}
Your a good girl now
You were daddy's little girl {yes I'm ready}
Wrap your arms around me {yes I'm ready}

[Verse Two]
They was telling me you doing good and working hard
But as for me steady huslin on the boulevard
Sometimes I catch my self In a memory bliss
Just thinking about you and the way you blew your kiss
With your big brown eyes and them candy lips
They way you did your hair running down your hips
But you was raised with them good old fashion ways
And never gave a damn if I was getting paid
You made your own life and you were doing right
Look at all the negativity you had to fight
And that's the type of women any man will get on his knees
Burning beggin please I loved it when you teased me
But I was raised on streets and I'm makin moves
Even thought you knew the things I do you disaproved of
I hope you doing well, it's kinda hard to tell
Every single day you got me checking on my mail

[Chorus 2X]

[Frost talking]
Yea what's up girl
I heard you was coming home soon
I hope it's true
Yea we got a lot to talk about
And I can't wait to see you
Call me

You said you ready baby {I'm ready}
You said you want me girl {I want you}
You said you need me {I really really need you}
I'll make you feel right

[Verse Three]
Since you been away I'm praying for a better way
And I've been searching for it every single day now
Hoping for a second chance maybe another dance
Used to be a player now I'm fiending for a romance
I must apologize to you in my heart and soul
I gotta say it's been a thrill for me to watch you grow
I know you ready fo the, I think I'm ready fo the
Let's get together baby and I'm show you

[Chorus till fade]
