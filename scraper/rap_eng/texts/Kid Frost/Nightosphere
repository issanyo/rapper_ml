Verse 1
I'm might hit Shawty with my poetic predicate
Matter fact she going get this long sentence
Oh forget it
I get to the commas lil mama
Flow lyrics make you scream and holla
And ya body make me wanna throw a couple dollars
Huh
Shawty it's obvious
That you got some problems
We all got some issues
I ain't saying iâ€™m here to fix you
J. Cole said
Don't save her if she don't wanna be saved
Tired thinking I can be your saviour
These girls making me anxious
So indecisive
Switch up like they changing majors
Girl i know you're game
You better quit while you're ahead
I ain't the one to be played
You did me wrong
All i ever wanted was your time
I was wrong girl ahlie
All these songs i make never waste
These niggas waste your time
But that never stopped them from being in ya face
He fed your head with dreams and you believed him
