[Verse 1]
They Call Me IoA I'm Not Confident
Always Stressed On Pops and shit
Never really give a fuck until they talk about my shit,.
Never was a pretty boy Never repped that trill shit
Cause I stay myself, I don't really need that bull shit
Never really had that swagg watch niggas just laugh and brag
Talking bout swagg when they can't get a A in class
I am not an ass I just Like to relax and laugh
Chilling off my profits But I'm Not about that cash
Trying keep it Casual Just acting Natural
Dramatic females in my life they coming after cash flow
New to the Bahamas game Not going after the fame
Experience for me Is just something I think I should gain
Stretch my way up to the top, Take a Glimpse I'll never drop
Been trying for the longest shouldn't I be further on the top?
Killing every teen single that these niggas ever drop
I know Latrill He got Em all, That's the hardest little nigga tops!

[Hook]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
That the real is on the rise, fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide, now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 2]
Catch Me spitting, Amazing
Call Me 4g, I'm blazing
Got these niggas lock down and Yeah boy they ain't escaping
Got No Money, But Saving
Pocket holey, No Rising
Gotta treat that girl right or She'll be Gone With pain In
Heart, Man this shit you hear is art
I be sketching and I'm Fetching every Pencil, Marker sharp
Don't be dissing when you listen or I just might leave a mark
I.H Winning, Don't be tripping you know what we do is Hard
Dog Gone. . . Bark When he hear the Car gone start
Cause he know we on the move and he don't like it like that
He don't want a nigga live he got a problem with that
But I'm Gonna fix him Up I'm gonna start it like that
Yeah Man I do it, Don't judge me but I do it
Don't believe a nigga see the facts so he could prove it
Killing all yo tracks, You better flow before you sue me
My cockiness for sure, I bet it really gonna screw me

[Hook]
