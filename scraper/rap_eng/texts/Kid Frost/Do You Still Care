[Hook]
Tell Me Do You Care?
(If You Still Care)
For Me (About Me)
Tell Me Do You Care?
(If You Still Care)
For Me

[Verse 1: Frank V]
Its Been A Little Minute
Since I First Got Down
Back In The Day
When N.W.A
Could Say Fuck The Police
In The Original Kday
Thought I Was Ice Cube
Went & Bought An A.K
Sprayed Some Boys In The Hood
But Don't Quote That
Thought I Was Eazy
When I Got My First Dope Sack
Bustin' Dope Raps
Servin' All The Fiends
Drug Money Was Legit
Rap Money Just A Dream
But The Dream Came True
When Kid Frost Came Through
I Heard La Raza
Shit, I Could Do The Same Too
So I Rep The Brown
In Every State & Town
Those Were The Days
But Today I Still Put It Down
For All The Fans
Who Feel They Got Disconnected
From The Game
When The Lames Came & Wrecked It
But If You Want The Real
Baby I'm Still Here
Are You Still There?
Tell Me Do You Still Care?

[Hook]
Tell Me Do You Care?
(If You Still Care)
For Me (About Me)
Tell Me Do You Care?
(If You Still Care)
For Me (For Me, For Me)

[Verse 2: Conejo]
I Came In Gang Bangin'
On The Mic
Ese Fresh Off The Street
In My Cortez Nikes
Ese Beach Cruiser Bikes
Smoking Primos At Night
On Some Territory Shit
Enemiga In Sight
I Knew How To Write
So I Put Em Together
My 4-Track Demos
Gon' Last Forever
Cause I'm Clever
With The Shit I Say
Just A Boy From The Block
West Side L.A
I Made A Deal With The Devil
I Traded My Soul
Didn't Know What I Was Doing
Till My Heart Turned Cold
And That Brought A Lot Of Trouble
In To My Life
Along With Classic Lp's
About My Struggles & Fights
But Still I Gotta Ask
If You Still Care
If Not I'll Pay A Visit
In Your Next Nightmare
That's Only Fair
Cause I Done This For You
Even Risk My Own Freedom
This Notorious Fool

[Hook]
Tell Me Do You Care?
(If You Still Care)
For Me (About Me)
Tell Me Do You Care?
(If You Still Care)
For Me (For Me

[Verse 3: Kid Frost ]
Its The Original OG
Everybody Knows Me
Started In The 80's
With That Homie Ice-T
I'm A West Coast Pioneer
Set It Off - Lead The Way
A Chicano Rapper
From The Streets Of East L.A
20 Years Later
Look At Me
Still On The Scene
Grinding Hard - Stacking Green
Still Doing My Music Thing
So Tell Me Do You Still Care?
To All My Loyal Fans
Are You Still There?
Put It In The Air
Throw It In The Sky
I'm A Do This Music Shit
Until The Day I Die
I Look Up In The Sky
You Know I Stay Strong
They Gonna Play My Music
Even When I'm Dead & Gone
A Legacy I Left Behind
You Won't Forget My Songs
I Hope My Spirit Feels It
Everytime You Put It On
Until My Dying Day
I Live Life Like A Boss
Its Viva La Raza
Y Viva Kid Frost

[Chorus / Outro]
Tell Me Do You Care?
(If You Still Care)
For Me (About Me)
Tell Me Do You Care?
(If You Still Care)
For Me
(Do You Feel The Same Way Too)
Tell Me  Do You Care?
(If You Still Care)
For Me
(Listen To My Heart Beat)
With You Near Me
When You Hold Me
Can You Kiss Me
(Do You Feel The Same Way Too)
