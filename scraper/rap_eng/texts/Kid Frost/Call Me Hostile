[Verse 1: Litefoot]

Tomahawk! I'm leaving scalps on the ground
I ride around town with my ragtop down
Things change by themselves, I got no hope on it
So I got a thirty odd six with a scope on it
Indian and I'm going to win
I bust a U with the lights out, fool, here I come again
Duck or get stuck! Be down and you will love it
Then I straight kicked the door off the cupboard
Then I jumped in with the Mossberg pumped in
Everybody recognized the beauty of my red skin
Because my people sent Litefoot to represent
Because they knew I'd make a stand in this rap shit
So let me gets mine one time
And recognize that I'm doing fine this time
Kick me when I'm down, and I'm a be right back
Get up, stand up, and I'm a have to fight back!

[Hook: Litefoot]
Fuck a treaty, my people are needy!
A tear's in my eye - the tomahawks fly
Fuck a treaty, the white man's greedy!
A tear's in my eye - the tomahawks fly

[Hook: Kid Frost]
I think I came up with a solution
And the answer is revolution
I think I came up with a solution
And the answer is revolution

[Verse 2: Litefoot]
I'm a member of a dying breed
And if they dust me I can't even plant my seed
I'm having visions every night
Of an eagle getting shot down while he's in flight
And I know it's got meaning so I'm scheming
I'm a fight till I die or till I stop dreaming
But it seems like crime pays
And it's hard getting through to these kids nowadays
And I don't see no more pride
Or understanding of why all the Natives died
So I'm recruitin' like Huey Newton
Except for the Indians I'm a start shootin'
And if I made a stand would you stand beside me?
And if they came to get me would you hide me?
It's a tribulation and a trial
I'm a fool with a gun so they still call me hostile

[Hook: Litefoot]
Fuck a treaty, my people are needy!
A tear's in my eye - the tomahawks fly
Fuck a treaty, the white man's greedy!
A tear's in my eye - the tomahawks fly

[Hook: Kid Frost]
I think I came up with a solution
And the answer is revolution
I think I came up with a solution
And the answer is revolution

[Verse 3: Litefoot]
I got a gun but I don't have to use it
I'm like Geronimo but fight with my music
There's no reservation that I ain't rocked
And people seem to listen when you're holding a Glock
So do I got you attention? Can I mention
All the tension and .45 clenching?
Violence got my people in silence
Afraid to speak so they're keeping us weak
In 1988 Litefoot crept in
Took it out to LA, then G spot stepped in
And we got a little life in '96
So I'm proud to say that they put me in the mix
It's happening just the way I planned it -
Took a little something something then I expanded
Into a whole other episode
And when I'm done with this clip I'm a have to reload...

[Verse 3:Kid Frost]
Fight back!

[Hook: Litefoot]
Fuck a treaty, my people are needy!
A tear's in my eye - the tomahawks fly
Fuck a treaty, the white man's greedy!
A tear's in my eye - the tomahawks fly

[Hook: Kid Frost]
I think I came up with a solution
And the answer is revolution
I think I came up with a solution
And the answer is revolution
