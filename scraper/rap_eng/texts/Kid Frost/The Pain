[Cisco] Wish the pain go away
[Frost] Cause it hurts so bad
[Nino]  You can't stop it

Chorus: Nino Brown & Don Cisco
I wish the pain
Would go away
But with money come the fame
It's such a dirty game
I wish the pain
Would go away
But sometimes
It feels like we livin' in a last days

[Verse 1: Frost]
Tu sabes, la vida malo, life's a struggle (Son)
It's hard growing up
Gettin' out the barrio
One way or another
We gotta make it
Everytime I come up
Somebody's tryin' to take it
Sometimes, I'm shakin'
I'm wakin' with a cold sweat
Thinking I got hit with six slugs to the chest
But homie, I ain't dead yet
I guess it's just a bad dream
A reoccuring nightmare
From all the bad shit I seen
A gangsta lean is what I can't seem to escape
I can't shake my shadow
It's tryin' to seal my fate
Who do I trust
Where do I turn
Don't be concerned when what I earn to avoid being burned

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Nino Brown]
Last day
Last day
One two
Yo

[Verse 2: Nino Brown]
See, I know they tryin' to hate us (That's right)
But you know, I gotta get them papers
Thirteen years in the rap game, now take a name, you know the name
On the grizzind like daily
Stackin' them chips, making 'em hits
So please don't ask how I got this platinum rolex on my wrist
You gotta know, when y'all known get fed up
Not gon' head up
With any motherfucker, say he got beef with me
Jealousy
You don't know me, punk
So how the fuck you gon' snitch
Like a little bitch, or shall I say, "Batch," like the homie say, Frisco Mac
I don't get down like that
Bet I got another chrome strap
Bet I got another model bitch, now bet she rubbin' up on my lap
Cuidado who you fuckin' with, homie
And who you talkin' to, homie
Cause you know we puttin' that shit down, for real, til I cop another mil
And that's real

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Don Cisco]
I wish the pain would go away, but the shit don't stop
I guess I'm stuck in the game til my casket drop
So tell my moms and my pops that I love 'em
What's up
To all the G's in the blocks, still thuggin'
We keep hustlin'
About that money, it can't stop the pain
But it can help ya when you hungry, keep ya out the rain
Classified as a thug
Cash is all I ever loved
My crew, never got caught, so dad's got a grudge
Trapped inside poverty
Tryin' to escape
In pursuit of luxury
Can I find a better way
Hey
And it's a shame when the pain hits ya
I hope it don't get ya mad when we get richer

{*beat changes*}

[Verse 4: Frost]
Why's that dark cloud over my head
I think it's gonna rain
I could feel the pain
Of all the people that I hurt for financial gain
And bad thoughts got me thinking that I've gone insane
I gotta make the great escape and get away from it all
To a city, where there ain't no
Pain at all
Take medicine from the earth to relieve my mind
Of all the pressures that I got from my daily grind
Cause nowadays, it's a trip, you can't only rhyme
You gots to kill for the scrill and scrap for nickels and dimes
And that's on everything I love, yes, it's a true plain fact
That ever since La Raza still stay packed
I roll around in my low, windows tinted black
Slang everythang to weed
Speed and crack
My pockets stay swoll and I'm always tact
Stepped away from the scene, but knew I'd always come back
Why ya all played catch up
Just tryin' to match up
To the man in the myth, you failed drastically
And plus those record sales spell catastrophe
No way on earth
You could ever come after me
So the next time that you catch yourself standin' in the rain
Tryin' to figure out how to take away the pain
