[Chorus: Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.]
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
Between love and hate

[Verse 1: Kid Frost]
Three in the morning, my pager reads your number
And at that point, I realized, you're starting to wonder
Where I'm at, what I'm doing and all that
I could have called, but instead I just sat back
Cause I've been calling you since ten
And now, it's three, I'm not your puppet on a string
So I'm letting you know to set things straight
That's it's a thin line between love and hate

[Chorus: Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E. & DeNetria Champ]
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
(Don't think you can keep treating me bad)
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
(I'll just sit back and enjoy it)
It's a thin line
(Yes it is, yes it is)
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
(He's going to fool you one day)

[Verse 2: Kid Frost]
I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love
So now it's time to let you know what's up
Do you remember, early December
You told me, "Don't come over
Because of the cold and rainy weather"
But *knock, knock, knock*
Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.: Who is it?
Kid Frost: Yo, it's Frost, girl
Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.: Let me in
DeNetria Champ: Frost don't let me down
Kid Frost: Well, you know I won't let you down
Just remember that

[Chorus: Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E. & DeNetria Champ]
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
(Don't think you can keep treating me bad)
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
(I'll just sit back and enjoy it)
It's a thin line
(Yes it is, yes it is, yes it is)
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
He will find you one day

[Saxophone solo]
Yes it is, yes it is

[Chorus: Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E. & DeNetria Champ]
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
(Love and hate, love and hate)
It's a thin line
Between love and hate

[Verse 3: Kid Frost]
It's five in the morning, and you're still trying to get through
Sweating the Frost for hanging out with the crew
But baby, if this keeps going on
I came and just like I came, I'm gone
We been through, thick and thin, good and bad
Arguments lost soon as I walked through the pad
But I knew you'd trip from the gate
Cause it's a thin line between love and gate

[Chorus: Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E. & DeNetria Champ]
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
(You can't keep treating me like this)
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
(Yes it is, yes it is)
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
(Between love and hate)
It's a thin line
(I'll just sit back and enjoy it)
Between love and hate
(Yes I will)

[Verse 4: Kid Frost]
I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love
And now it's time to let you know what's up
Do you remember, early December
You told me, "Don't come over
Cause of the cold and rainy weather"
But *Knock, knock, knock*
Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.: Who is it?
Kid Frost: Yo, it's Frost, girl
Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.: Let me in
DeNetria Champ: Frost, don't let me down
Don't let me down

[Chorus Till Fade: Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E. & DeNetria Champ]
It's a thin line
(It's a thin line)
Between love and hate
(Don't think you can keep treating me bad)
It's a thin line
(I'll just sit back, I'll just sit here)
Between love and hate
(Sing it here, sit here and enjoy it)
It's a thin line
(Yes it is, yes it is, yes it is, yes it is)
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
(Yes it is)
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
(He'll fool you one day)
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
(It's a thin line, a thin line)
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
(You can't keep treating me like this baby)
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
(Yes it is, yes it is)
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
(Yes it is, yes it is)
Between love and hate
