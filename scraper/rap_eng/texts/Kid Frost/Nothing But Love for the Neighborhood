[Verse 1: Frost]
Haha, yeah
Now let me tell you about my neighborhood
As I scan through the city, it's not all bad, there's some good
So if you roll through my town don't be nervous
You can still catch a family at a Sunday service
Or hanging out, cooling out, just barbequing
If you ask me, you better check what you be doing
Cause if you look past the liqour store on every corner
You can find a working man in a van, a home owner
Not everyone is drunk in a ditch
As a matter of fact I heard a broke man became rich
So it makes me wanna frown
That you would wanna put me down cause my neighborhood of town
But that's cool, it ain't nothing new
So I'mma tell the truth about the hood on this record for you
Now check it
If I could make this world perfect I would, but I can't
And I still got nothing but love for the hood

[Hook: Rich Garcia] (x2)
I got love, love, love, love, love
Nothing but love
Nothing but love, love, love, love, love
Nothing but love for the hood

[Verse 2: Frost]
I know a kid born in the projects too
And you should see the things he was subjected to
That didn't mean that he would do the same
Like go find a gun or run with a gang
He took the right route, he learned a little math
A college education, now a champange of bubble bath
I know another man who makes $4.25
Works two jobs to keep his family alive
You say it's bad
But why's this man filled with joy
Every Saturday he's playing ball with his little boy
And raising him the right way
Showing him a way out you might say
You see, you're never too old to learn
So just sit back and listen as I take my turn
If I could make this world perfect I would, but I can't
And I still got nothing but love for the hood

[Verse 3: Frost]
Population 69,000
Now that's a whole lot of people that my hood be housing
Most of them are happy, make the best from the worst
But you be trying to act like the ghetto is cursed
Now check it
Little kids playing out in the park
Mama yelling out their name when it gets dark
An old man, he takes out his garbage cans
And then he turns with a smile to shake the next man's hand
And all I see is love and sensitivity
But if the government could, then they'd get rid of me
But now I sure am glad that I was brought up strong
Now let me tell you, mama brought the Frost up with values
And if you fall, then I'mma be the first one to help you out
And see, you thought I was the worst one
If I could make this world perfect I would, but I can't
And I still got nothing but love for the hood
