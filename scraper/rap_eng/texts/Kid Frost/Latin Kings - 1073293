Can you handle it?
Latin Kings, peep the flow we bring
Every show shake the scene, you know the routine
Top notch players, dope rhyme sayers
Latinos, tenemos que unirnos
Never mind what you claim to know
Your last name slow, becomes irrelevant
Heaven sent, I'm militant, born Spanish and innocent
Lifestyle's assumed, the past consumes me
With stereotypes and tel-lie-vision that I see
How to be, an understandable role model for the youth
When I'm speakin with my neck in this noose
Cut me loose amigo, tu hermano latino
Soy chicano, vamos down the same camino
Controlando y vigilando dinero cause
Nobody moves more contraband than San Diego
La frontera, mera mera, we got the biggest border
In the world so we're seein all the feria
Don't get caught with your pants down
We advance ground, and got a list of demands now
It's for the brown crowd, spanish queens
Filtered Souls, and West Coast Latin Kings
Latin Kings, peep the flow we bring
Every show shake the scene, you know the routine
Top notch players, dope rhyme sayers
Latinos, tenemos que unirnos
Low profile lifestyle, I love my jefita bonita
Cookin frijoles con aguita
Salsita, con tortillas hecho a mano
Damn it feels good to be chicano!
Soy travieso, latino fino to the hueso
Respeto, to all my gente en el ghetto
Mejico, Suramerica Aztlan y Puerto Rico
Pobre grande y chico, sabor rico
Don't you understand?
We were the first to hit the switch
Now they're bouncin in Japan
Fumando puros de Cuba
Menudo pa'la cruda
Plantando tomates y lechuga
Sarapes y juaraches
Feelin sucio salvaje en el zoot suit traje
Tomo vino con latinos unidos
Bailando al sonido, hay dios mio!
Latin Kings, peep the flow we bring
Every show shake the scene, you know the routine
Top notch players, dope rhyme sayers
Latinos, tenemos que unirnos
The latin race, above la ley
It's Mr. Old School veterano from East L.A
Nino de nieve, straight up and down for the plebe
Heinas sittin pretty in my ragtop Chevy
Just ask Shysti, and homeboy will tell you
We stack big mail down here in San Diego
So I smash with Baby Beesh, thinkin bout cash
Sidewindin down the 5 to the 6-1-9
Page the homey Mad One, he told me that he had one
A whole kilo, meet him down in San Recida
So I quickly changed clothes, switched up my rental
Checked out the mo mo I'm payin on my incidentals
Got my mind made up, f*ck a feud and a hoodrat
I got a stack for all the god damn scratch
Scrilla, feria
So watch out when I come into your ar-ea
Latin Kings, peep the flow we bring
Every show shake the scene, you know the routine
Top notch players, dope rhyme sayers
Latinos, tenemos que unirnos
