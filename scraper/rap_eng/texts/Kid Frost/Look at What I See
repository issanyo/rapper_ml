[Verse 1: A.L.T.]
Domino, now we're in the mix
I know that you holding 3-5 and a double 6
I got yo' money fool now what you gonna do
You're acting like them fools on the other side do
But all that heebity-heebity shit is old
We got 15 platinum to your one pussy ass gold
(Hold up, wait a minute
A.L.T. put some motherfucking curse once in)
Now I'm back on the streets after five and the deuce
And everybody's trying say there's a gang truce but fuck that
I gotta put away the one that put me in to the pen
The one who made the stone from a grin
No more old school fights I got you in my sights
My blast is gonna light up the night
If you're gonna talk the talk, walk the walk
Cause your body fits perfect in the outline chalk

[Chorus: Diane Gordon & A.L.T.]
Look at what I see... Look into my eyes..
Take a look at life to the eyes of the criminal

[Verse 2: Frost]
Take a look into my eyes can you see what I see
A day in the life of a G
Cuffed up, ruffed up and kick when I'm down
Some say I play the tears of the clown
West Coast down to the bone
I made it on my own with my motherfucking rhymes and my chrome
Money in the bank and the pound of dank
A flight out of Kennedy I think that's the remedy
Just like the weed, them fools is wack
Trying to rap on the West Coast gangsta track
But that ain't happening and they ain't platinum
Reach back like a pimp n' I'm slapping 'em
Now should I take my .45 and demand mine
Since I'm the hitting bomb call me dilemma
Straight up parlay I'm West Coasting
Never leave the pad without my .9 in my holster

[Chorus: Diane Gordon & A.L.T.]
Look at what I see... Look into my eyes..
Take a look at life to the eyes of the criminal
Look at what I see... Look into my eyes..
Take a look at life to the eyes of the criminal

[Verse 3: Frost & A.L.T.]
19 motherfucking 95
Balling through the hood with my 'Lac in drive
Ragtop rag hitting side to side
But Frost got ?? for the bails tonight
Just last week I was ?stalling?
Picking up money smiling as I was in Terminal Island
I just made parole so it's time to stroll
Pick up my man A.L.T. and we're roll

Ayo, Frost pass the keys to the trunk
So I can get the shells and the Mausberg pump
So I can go wild like I don't give a fuck
So I can make the pump 12 gauge go buck *shot*
Take a look in life to the eyes of the criminal
There's no picket-fences and life ain't sample
I'm living day today homie check it
I can take your life in the L.A. second

[Chorus: Diane Gordon & A.L.T.]
Look at what I see... Look into my eyes..
Take a look at life to the eyes of the criminal
Look at what I see... Look into my eyes..
Take a look at life to the eyes of the criminal
Look at what I see... Look into my eyes..
Take a look at life to the eyes of the criminal
Look at what I see... Look into my eyes..
Take a look at life to the eyes of the criminal
