[Intro Dialogue: Kid Frost]
Hey holmes, this is Kid Frost from East Los Angeles
And I'm ready to kick another one from East LA to San Jose

[Verse 1: Kid Frost]
I stepped to the party acting fresca
Drinking cerveza smoking yesca
Kicking back listening to the oldies
Ralph M, Sisco and my homeboy Shorty
They play another firme rola
Chico G is trying to find himself a chola
Steps to the crowd and then he makes his choice
Through the bumper system I hear my voice
Yeah, this is for the Raza
Yo man it's crazy all the places that I played
From the calles of Los all the way up to the east coast
Insane all the places that I've popped
All the times at the limos drop us off at the airport
We got to catch another plane
And then four more hours on a train
Six more cities after that
And it'll be time to get home again, man I'm with that
But in the meantime, let me bust this little rhythm for you about the volo

[Hook: Kid Frost]
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)

[Verse 2: Kid Frost]
Now I am at the volo
It's time to take the mic like old times
Say some rhythms, yo cause that's my duty
Chill with the homeboys group with the cuties
And take another hit
The Hispanic causing panic smokes the organic shit
The boys I hang around, they don't play around
Then they'll poof put a cap in your noodles
A punk walked up to me and said, "Donde eres?"
I said the Alliance, porque holmes, que quieres
You want to get them up and throw some playto
I'm down for mine from the gecko
I got my dude gavero
Stop 38 with a handle of pearl
And finish the problem solo
Trucha, back to the volo

[Hook: Kid Frost]
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)

[Verse 3: Kid Frost]
Cooling with la raza
Don't bring your fingers, homeboy pasa
Waiting for the jack
Showing my homeboys the brand new tat
On the outside, a unknown shack
A.L.T. pissing in the back
Man you smoking the cool so he's tripping
The DJ turn tables skipping
Here comes the badge and gun
Yo, you can't arrest me for having fun
The placa come around
Telling Ralph to turn the system down
He got the flashlight shining this eve
But wait until he leaves
And then we'll pump the system up
Got three more case but only one more cup
Send Pablo to the liquor store
Tell him gets some pave cause we ain't got no more
He don't go solo
He takes some homeboys from the volo

[Hook: Kid Frost]
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)
The volo
(Cruising in the calle)

[Outro Dialougue: Kid Frost]
Haha. Oraje holmes

The volo
(Cruising in the calle)
