From big L.A. to Rey, my teams stay muted up
I call Danny Trey, bring the cameras and we shoot it up
Eric's gone green, from wax to the crystal
Step into my studio, say wassup to Krypto
L.A. to Mejico, hit my partner Jose
Catch us at the proms out in Vegas sipping rosay
Stop being nosey, everything is okay
Diamonds on my chain say my name so they know me
Hit the homie, Mister D
Yes, he pushed underground
Tony G. upon this beat, sister eight is still around
I wear a heavy crown
Hop into many towns
Ice cold with the flow, brown, monster-style
Like a boss
Oh yes I keep the bank rollin'
Like a boss
Dippin' lean big paper holdin'
Like a boss
You know we got it locked down
Like a boss

Talk about some double ups, I'll double that in quarterback
Throw 'em back to hefty out in Corcrim with the note attached
Homies holdin' lotus straps
I'm just trying to say some raps
Popped a couple mollies, now she's gone, ain't no coming back
Post a double my cool deep
Got a long reach and we don't sleep
Ain't messin' around with no regular clowns
We all practice what we preach
We rollin'
Don't know what the fuck they smokin'
As they blowin' they just chokin'
Turns up got my windows down and my subwoof' open
I'm coastin'
Hit the homie Frost, this is Major Payne
Payin' what it costs like a boss, in a major way
Kryptonite, Kryptonite
Kyrptonite, Kryptonite
How we do it, homie?

Like a boss we out here gettin' it
Ain't slowin' up for nothin'
Try to fuck around with the boss-man, them stripes will get to bustin'
On that Billy the Kid shit
Out of west we gettin' blown
And big Eric got that Braun whacked
We dabbin' hits to the dome
Walk that beef and bring them patties with us
Slap it up on the grill
And big Kryptonite, he got kryptonite
He quick to light up that still
Now so real we only pick reels
Crackin' bottles, no big deal
Rubber band, boys, we stay with dough and stay foldin' up them big bills
Like a boss, we bossin' up out here
Everybody knows that
That's what rap the homeboys gettin' it
That's Tony G. on the track
Ask your homeboys and your homegirls
Guaranteed they know the name
We brown monster and we in this and we smashin' up on the game
Like a boss

Oh yes I keep the bank rollin'

Dippin' lean big paper holdin'
