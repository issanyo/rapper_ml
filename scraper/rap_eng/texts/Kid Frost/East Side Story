[Verse 1: Kid Frost]
Growing up in the East Side of Los Angeles
Aztec Evangelist
Showing you the words of wisdom
Stay out the pinta, the pen, or prison
I see some crazy shit
Vatos on the corner, smoking Kools, getting lit
You gotta take what cards they deal ya
Jumped his ass in and now his click is his familia
And he might have to beat ya
Es mi barrio, mi barrio es mi vida
I wouldn't joke ya
The placa gaffled up my homegirl Flaka
Cause she was smoking coca
Hows she gonna manage?
Tiny midgets in the Calle, they're doing damage
And it's far from glory
As a matter of fact, it's an East Side Story

[Verse 2: Kid Frost]
I see some homeboys looking for steady
Rollin' up slow, in the carucha
