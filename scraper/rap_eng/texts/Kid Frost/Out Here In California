[Danny Trejo]
Whats Up Raza? This Is Danny Trejo
And You're Listening To Old School Funk
With My Bestfriend Kid Frost
Old West Baby Thats What Its All About

[Kid Frost]
We About To Take A Trip Today
Through The City That They Call L.A. But Hey
Compton, Pico, Pasadena
Lynwood, Watts & West Covina
The Ward Maywood
Yall Stay Mello Out
In Pico, La Puente & Montebello
Monte's Where We Made A Quick Stop
But East Los Is Where We Finally End Up

[Chorus: Big Swiisha]
Out Here In California
Where The Streets Don't Sleep
From L.A. To The Bay
In California
Better Watch Your Mouth
Cause Them Locos Don't Play
Out Here In California
And We Got The Best Weed
See The Palm Trees
Cruise On These Streets
And Its Known As Califas

[Verse 1: Frost]
Yeah Welcome To Califas
Vatos Locos
Cruising Down The Bully
Its The Home Of The Low-Lows
I'm Taking Flight Like The L.A.X
I'm Bigger Than The Hollywood Sign
I'm The Connect
They Know Me In The Bay
Down To East L.A
Or Even Down In Dago
Where They Cross That Weight
Label Me A Warrior
From The Golden State
I'm The First That Ever Did It
Man I Opened The Gates
Shout Out To The Homies
Doing Time In The Pen
And I Pray For The Day
I See My Homies Again
Whittier To Slauson
Or KiKi In Compton
L.B.C. To Pasadena
On Down To Carson
We Twist Blunts
And Lace Em Up With Wax
My Mic Is My Skillet
So I Hit It Like A Dab
Now Tell Me We Ain't Got
The Most Beautiful Women
Sunny Southern California
Come Here To Visit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Sonny Blue]
I'm Here In California
Where The Gangstas Function
With Tattoo'd Armors
And Gang Injunctions
We Medicate Off Top Shelf Kush
We Gotta Stay High
Gotta Hit That Slauson Swapmeet
We Gotta Stay Fly
Retro Military Force
With The Champion Hoodie
501's Sharp Creases
Nickel Plated To ?
South Central
How I Love My City
Feel Good To Be Brown
Cause I Run My City
Bumping Corridos
In The Chevrolet
Smooth Hustle Do It Big
Gettin' Money In A Major way
Yeah, We Run The Streets Like Marathons
And My Phone Stay Ringing
Off The Hook Like A Teflon

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Guzzle]
Borderline City Boy
Thats My City
San Diego Fry Em
I'm A Five-Nine-Fifty
Chrome D Spinnin'
Good Trees, Women
Good Tunes Playin'
Thats The Way That I'm Livin'
Driving Real Slow
Riding Real Low
Leanin' To The Side
Like I Got Nowhere To Go
I Got My Mind On Money
Boy Its All About The Doe
I Got My Eyes On The Haters
Encase They Scheming On The Low
Yo You Ready? Here We Go
Let Me Give You The Grand Tour
Take You On A Trip
Through The City I Rap For
Where They Hustle Hard
And They Get It In
But That's Nothin' New
When You Livin' In

[Chorus]
