[Intro: Kid Frost]
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh it's on now, foo
Just when you heard it all, nah this ain't no gang story
This is a story about one of my homies
Yeah you know whats up
Hey yo Litefoot show them the real foo

[Verse 1: Litefoot & (Kid Frost)]
Last night I heard the cops say freeze
But now a days life on the rez ain't horses and teepees
I Never had a good day, its bad enough they took our land
Now we dealing with this B.I.A
But that's an Indian's life out in OK
I'm sendin' the smoke signals all the way to L.A
Put out the peace pipe, put on the war paint
Put down the bow and arrow, now I got an AK
And then Kid Frost stepped off the plane
This Mexican from LA is a little insane (loco)
Frost, My people got a problem, (what's that?)
You see they keeping us down, now do you think that we can solve them?
Strong arm straight up, that's the solution
Get your self an army and start a revolution
Pollution in the sky makes me cry
I'm proud to be a Cherokee and willing to die

[Chorus: Kid Frost]
OGs fighting to survive
They bout to recognize that I'm willing to die
OGs fighting to survive
They bout to recognize the tribe's willing to die

[Chorus: Kid Frost]
OGs fighting to survive
They 'bout to recognize that I'm willing to die
OGs fighting to survive
They 'bout to recognize the tribe's willing to die

[Verse 2: Litefoot]
Fighting is in my blood, it's just the way that I am
I'm creeping with the Prophet and my Man Cheyenne
Circling the reservation like a vulture
And granddaddy always kept me up on my culture (that's right)
So I'm proud to be a Cherokee
And the United States government ain't scaring me
Back in the days they killed Indians for salaries
I call the one time a modern day Calvary
What's gonna happen when we fight back?
Strap the guns again man, they ain't gonna like that
They gonna have to come and get me
Black boots and hundreds of troops like 1860
So listen to the words that I'm writing
If I'm going down, bet your ass I was fighting
Ask me what I am and I can never deny
I'm an Indian, homeboy, and I'm willing to die

[Chorus: Kid Frost]
OGs fighting to survive
They 'bout to recognize that I'm willing to die
OGs fighting to survive
They 'bout to recognize the tribe's willing to die

[Post-Chorus: Kid Frost]
Yeah, are you willing to die?
Yeah, are you willing to die?

[Verse 3: Litefoot]
We the only people in the world without a motherland
Legally that is, but I'll explain it on another chance
I been American before there were Americans (Americans)
Back when they to call my people redskins (redskins)
Have you ever herd of Billy Jack
Well this is Litefoot Homeboy and I'm a little worse than that
I come equipped with a 30 shot clip
And my tribe got the vibe so they ready to trip
Somebody gotta take a stance so I'ma stand up
Talk about the problem and I'ma bring the land up
You took this country and you demented it
You saw a land that was green and you cemented it
Machinery replaced all the greenery
And now you acting like you shouldn't mean a thing to me
So I'ma organize and give it one more try
You see I'm Cherokee and willing to die

[Chorus: Kid Frost]
OGs fighting to survive
They 'bout to recognize that I'm willing to die
OGs fighting to survive
They 'bout to recognize the tribe's willing to die

[Outro: Litefoot]
This goes out to every Cheyenne and Apache
Cherokee, Inca, the Maya, Comanche, Navajo, Aztec
The people of the sun, run Indian run
This goes out to every Cheyenne and Apache
Cherokee, Inca, the Maya, Comanche, Navajo, Aztec
The people of the sun, run Indian run
Yeah, Litefoot
Puttin' it down
