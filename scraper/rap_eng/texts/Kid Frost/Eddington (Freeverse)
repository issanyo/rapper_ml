99 percent of the time, i'll occupy your mind
You gotta listen up, fetch a tent and a sign, its my time
Write rhymes, inner fly, I got that kite mind
Now tell me is it the right time to let my light shine

Sense you don't make like a sentence without spaces
Ya'll don't paint pictures you just deliver traces
Back to the basics, let them see like Lasik
No matter what the case is, no serve, i'll ace it

Test my progress of my blessing no lessons
Your girl needs a session of caressing, no questions
No I'm just messing, or am I? Keep you guessing
Constant stressing, only talkin' about lettuce and dressing

Fuck That! I was on the bottom like fat chicks
And now the worlds on top of where my sack is
Or they ask where the cash is
They say rap is only for black kids
Rappin' about Racks, to me, Nordstrom's is where that is

Fire on the mic, leave you all ashy
I just run this shit like a track meet
As for the promise ring, boy don't ask me
Cause now we're in the back seat, no taxi
But at least you now know she isn't classy

The listeners admire, your girl prespires
Your songs drag on (dragon), I spit fire
I need to aquire my desires when the situation's dire
I will never tire, or become a liar, Frost

She on my wiener like sauerkraut
Spittin' harder than a llama mouth
The kid can truely rap, and besides common doubt
Frost isn't a lost cause because I'm hotter than a sauna now

You ain't never real, Amish Online Dating
If you're hot bitch, I'm 10 degrees past Satan
