Out living my life so now I'm barely in the booth
But I'm always on my grind, yet I rarely ever move
I'll never be satisfied that's the scary bitter truth
That's the difference between awake or fucking arrogant like you
Young American and stupid. That was me a couple years back
Clouded was the vision didn't have a sight to clear path
You hear that? That's the tone of clarity
You basic rapping motherfuckers can't and won't compare to me
Rap is open therapy, I try to find my center
Steady working to get better while you idolize them figures
Now I'm fighting for our lives cuz that's how I define a winner
I am not a super hero Mr. 99 percenter
My wallets fucking empty but that don't define my worth
It's truly all about my actions and its all about my words
I hope before I perish I leave positivity for earth
And that's the reason that I do this, know it starts within me first
Gotta be the change I wanna see
Gotta leave behind a part of me
Gotta break the chains that harbor me
Gotta free myself with honesty
Gotta wear my heart out on my sleeve
Gotta walk the path that's hard to see
Gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta pardon me
I am just a robot with a genuine cause
Synthetic veins and organs still I'm pumping out this hip hop
Hella handy with the timing like a motherfucking wristwatch
Never trying to flex up, or impress you- these are just thoughts
So what you want? Someone to vomit rhyming wordy music?
Or someone to spit that real that got a purpose to it?
