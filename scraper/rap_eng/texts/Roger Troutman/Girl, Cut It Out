Girl, cut it out
Baby, you should know
I've been watchin' you for days
You got a face like an angel
But I can see the devil in your ways
Every sinner in town is watchin' you
Some say you got the preacher too
That ain't right
Girl, cut it out
Girl, cut it out
Oh, I used to be an innocent girl
Yes she was
Lord, but you man have busted me
You broke my heart
You took all of my money
It won't be like that no more
Cos' with power
You let me know that now
I know what you want
I know what makes you weak
I'm cold blooded baby
I got ice cubes into my veins
You can plead if you please
I will not let it out
No, I won't cut it out
Girl, cut it out
Girl, cut it out
You know you aren't with it
Stop carryin' on that way
You're cold blooded
You nasty nasty girl
Stop with your carryin' on
And change your nasty ways
Cut it out, cut it out
Cut it out, cut it out
Cut it out
Girl, cut it out
Cut it out
I say you know, you know, you know
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't
Me doin' right, no
Girl, cut it out
Come on
Girl, cut it out
