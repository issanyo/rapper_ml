Tonight

Now, this little girl was born to dance
My good side
My bad side was worrying me
You see the man I love
Ain't nowhere to be found

I'm staring at the phone
But it won't make a sound
These four walls are getting me down
I gotta get on a merry-go-round

What you gonna do?
I made up my mind

Tonight I'll be free
I'm gonna dance
Like I belong to me tonight
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance tonight
I'm gonna dance like I belong to me

I'm tryna keep it together
It's 'bout to get me down, oh
What you want from a lady
I don't understand

You're always peeking at the ladies
With the short dresses on
You only want me in mine
When we're alone
I'm going out tonight

I'm in a real good mood
I need a change of space
And a fresh attitude
I'm tired
Now I can't take it no more

What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
I made up my mind

Tonight I'll be free
I'm gonna dance like
I belong to me tonight
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance tonight
I'm gonna dance like I belong to me

Tonight
I'm gonna be free
I'm gonna be free
