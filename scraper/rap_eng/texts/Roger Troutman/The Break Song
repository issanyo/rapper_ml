Break, break, break...
There's a new dance spreadin' like
Wallflowers
They add a new step about
Every hour
I tried to find out who could teach me
They said:
"You can find out if you watch TV"
Yes they did, yeah
I turned on my set to check it out
The steps they had
But the rhythm they worked out
So I went to the ghetto
To check it out (yes I did)
When I got to the ghetto
Here's what I found
Everybody is breakdancin', too good oh my head
But the ghetto children they are the kings, they are the queens to me
Could this be real, it 's like magic to me
They move on their shoulders as well as their feet
Keep on movin'
Turn the street corners, Lord, into dance halls
Keep on breakin'
Slap music blastin', a pulsating beat
Oh how I love to watch you ghetto child slammin' down
Slammin' down, slammin' down
(I can dig it, just break out...
Aw, aw, aw, ah)
Everybody is breakdancin', too good oh my head
But the ghetto children they are the kings, they are they queens to me
They made a Hollywood movie about breakdancin' (yes they did)
They should've brought their cameras straight to the ghetto
Lemme tell you 'bout a cat I saw
He couldn't be more than 3 feet tall
It was a real thrill diggin' on him
Steppin', dancin', watchin' him spin
After doin' several steps he laid flat on his back
He froze babe, I thought he was dead
The next time I saw him he was down on his head breakin' down
Everybody is breakdancin', too good oh my head
But the the ghetto children they are the kings, they are the queens to me
Ah...
Break, break, break...
