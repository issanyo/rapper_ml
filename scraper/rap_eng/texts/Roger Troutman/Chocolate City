Won't you come with me to Chocolate City

In the city of L.A.
There's a place where the player plays
Chocolate City
Every Mac player knows
That's where all the honeys go
Chocolate city
You can see who you wanna see
And you can be with who you wanna bee
At Cocolate city

Wont you come with me to Chocolate City
You can find romance at Chocolate City

As the player plays his game
Mackin' honeys all the same
At Chocolate City
All the fellas try to play it cool
But the player makes the rules
At Chocolate city
He's got all the honeys waitin' in line
For him to make up his mind

You can come and dance at Chocolate City
You can find romance at Chocolate City

Here we go
Here we go again
Now you don't try to tell me that a "girl is just a friend"
But I'm no hoe
But I know again
Boy your lies this time
Will never get you into my heart
Or my mind
Gonna take my time
True love I'm gonna find

Wont you come with me to Chocolate City

Yes it's on, baby yes it's on, mama
At Chocolate City
Yes it's on, baby yes it's on, mama
At Chocolate City
Yes it's on, baby yes it's on, mama
At Chocolate City
