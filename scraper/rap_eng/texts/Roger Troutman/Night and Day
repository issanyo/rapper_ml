[Verse 1]
I can't make it on my own
Alone this house just ain't a home
All that bad talk I put down
[?] I don't need you around
[?] turned me around
It made me talk like a foolish clown
But when I saw you foolin' around
It made me put my feet back on the ground

[Hook]
I need your loving night and day
I need your loving night and day

[Verse 2]
Soft words and some promises
Came from other girls
But that void that you left, girl
Can only be filled by your love
I thought it settled with a divorce
I had friends that I didn't before
I thought I had it all
But I knew I had nothing
When I saw you walking out that door

[Hook]
I need your loving night and day
I need your loving night and day

[Break]

[Verse 3]
I'll come back to you, baby
Yes, I'll swallow my pride
This empty hollow feeling
Is too big for me to hide
I can step down off of my throne
If stepping down is gonna make you come home
Cause, baby, if I'm without you, baby
No matter how you cut it
It's still living alone

[Hook]
I need your loving night and day
I need your loving night and day

[Break]

[Hook]
I need your loving night and day
I need your loving night and day
I need your loving night and day, baby
I need your loving night and day

Nobody else will do, no
Nobody else will do, no

[Outro]
I don't wanna be alone
Just don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
Just don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
Just don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
Just don't wanna be alone
