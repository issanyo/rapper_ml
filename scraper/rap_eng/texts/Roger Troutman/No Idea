[ VERSE 2: KAM ]
How much mo' can I take
I'm all alone in a world gone mad
Brothers is doin bad
I had hopes and dreams, it seems like though nobody care
Who says life is fair cause ain't no justice out here nowhere
I prepare myself to hold court right here in the street
Don't come at me with no b.s., homie, give me five feet
I can't get no sleep, peace and quiet or rest
I got ulcers, migraines and pains in my chest
So God bless my soul, I feel old when I'm not
But physically and mentally I'm going through a lot
I know my time on this big blue baloon is short
Stress and pray everyday while people playin sport
Worry myself sick, so I be tryin to stay active
But death is lookin more and more attractive
Lord have mercy, why me, I know you ain't make no mistake
But look at what a brother down here goin through for yo sake

Don't think I'm happy, homie, just because you see me grinning
Behind a smile, stress got my head spinning
And I'm just trying to be polite, I had a real rough night
And I don't wanna see no friends until I get my ends right
I got enough problems, and it's messing up my health
I keep putting my family and friends before myself
When I'm the one who need help but too proud to ask for it
When there's something wrong with me y'all be the last to know it
Cause I don't show it, I handle it and privately suffer
Having patience is a mutha
Trials and tribulations, that's how my lessons begin
I'm overpowered by death and the impressions of men
I'm trying to overcome these obstacles that I meet
With women, kids, work, religion and my friends in the street
I done spread myself too thin, fell into a trap
And now I'm just about ready to snap
