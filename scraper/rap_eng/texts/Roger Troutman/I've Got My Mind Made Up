[Chorus]
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up

[Verse 1]
More and more
There was less and less
Of your time baby
The more I saw
I wanted more
I wanted all of you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Your smile's so sweet to me, baby
The way you look to me, baby
You're with me in my dreams, baby
You're my reality, lost is my fantasy
Your smile's so sweet to me, baby
The way you look to me, baby
I
I

[Chorus]
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up
I'm gone

[Verse 2]
More and more
I fell deeper in
Into your charms, baby
Shoot my soul
And you stood my mind
When you held me in your arms, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Your smile's so sweet to me, baby
The way you look to me, baby
You're with me in my dreams, baby
You're my reality, lost is my fantasy
Your smile's so sweet to me, baby
The way you look to me, baby
I
I

[Chorus]
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up

[Bridge]
I
I
I
I, I
I

[Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, I
I've got my mind made up
I, I, I, I, I, I
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up

[Bridge]
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you
Baby, you know it's true
Baby, you know it's true
Baby, you know it's true
Baby, you know it's true
(Do you) Do you feel the same way too?
(Do you) Do you feel the same way too?
(Do you) Do you feel the same way too?
(I) Do you feel the same way too?
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you
Baby, you know it's true
Baby, you know it's true
Baby, you know it's true
Baby, you know it's true
(Do you) Do you feel the same way too?
(Do you) Do you feel the same way too?
Do you feel the same way too?
(I) Do you feel the same way too?

[Chorus]
I've got my mind made up
