(scatting)

[Verse 1]
For so long I've waited for you to come and hold me
Don't waste my time
'Cause I need you to let me know if you want me to
Do the things to you no other can do
I want you too
I want you bad, and I won't lie
I can't deny that I want you tonight

[Chorus]
Hold me, love me
Give me all that you got
Tell me, truly
Can I get in the right spot?

[Verse 2]
I wonder what is it that turns me on when I'm next to you
Can't figure out why I want you
Is it lust or love? Either one will do
'Cause I want you for myself, nobody else
Could take the place of you
Right now 'cause it is on
So unplug the phone, 'cause I want you to hold me

[Chorus]
Hold me, love me
Give me all that you got
(Give me all that you got, yeah)
Tell me, truly
Can I get in the right spot?

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Hold me, love me
Give me all that you got
Tell me, truly
Can I get in the right spot?
