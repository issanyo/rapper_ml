[Interlude]
You know I’ve been spendin’ quite a bit of time
Thinkin’ about my emotions
There’s been a lot of love
And there’s been a lot of pain
And I wanna be honest
Many times I just wanted to walk away
But I couldn’t
And many times I thought you would walk away
But you stayed right here by my side
And girl, that’s how I really know
That my emotions are so real
Let it flow
