[Intro]
Computerized, digital love
Computerized
Oh, baby
A beautiful love
Computer love, computer, computer love
Computer love, lookin' for my computer, ohh
Computer love, hey
Computer love, computer love, love

[Verse 1]
You know I've been searching for someone
Who can share that special love with me
And your eyes have that glow
Could it be your face I see on my computer screen
Need a special girl, ooh yeah
To share in my computer world, my computer world
I no longer need astrology
Thanks to modern technology

[Chorus]
Shooby-doo-bop, shoo-doo-bop I, wanna love you
Shooby-doo-bop, I wanna love you baby, computer love
Shooby-doo-bop, shoo-doo-bop I, wanna love you
Shooby-doo-bop, my computer love

[Verse 2]
You know I've been around
From sexy mamas to cool Prima Donnas
I wanna share your treasure, oh so rare
Cause its your face I see on my computer screen
Oh won't you keep me warm tonight
You are such a sweet delight
I will cherish the memory of this night
Yes I found my computer love

[Chorus]
Shooby-doo-bop, shoo-doo-bop I, wanna love you
Shooby-doo-bop, I wanna love you baby, computer love
Shooby-doo-bop, shoo-doo-bop I, wanna love you
Shooby-doo-bop, my computer love
