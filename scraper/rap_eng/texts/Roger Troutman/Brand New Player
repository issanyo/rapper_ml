[Verse 1]
Yeah a brand new player's coming town
He's charming the badies and funkin' up tha ladies minds
His message is clear so lets get down
He throws up his hand and strikes up a [?]
Making my music that nobody can stand (music, music)
Making my music that nobody can stand (if you feel good...)

[Chorus]
Player, brand new player
Player, he's a player
Player, brand new player

[Verse 2]
Never seen a cat do a show like this
Now listen honey, the way he [?] when he walks
Its all good you know you glance up, I know I should
Can't stop tha~rhythm do nobody can do
Plays tha funk with his guitar
Laid down a you know that funky sound
Oh why don't you tell tha children

[Chorus]
Player, brand new player
Player, he's a player
Player, brand new player

[Verse 3]
Now making people happy is the aim of my game
If your feeling kinda blue how about you ease tha pain
Now can't helped it that your [?] are all due
If you honeys playing around ain't a thing I can do
Sing a song, well, well anything of he's got some kinda magic touch
When I play my guitar everybodys gonnah feel real loose
Bust a loose and get down!
Get down

[Chorus]
Player, brand new player
Player, he's a player
Player, brand new player
