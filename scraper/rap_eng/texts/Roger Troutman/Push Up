I think I saw your body 'fore I saw your face
The kinda moves you made were rockin' the place
Then your favourite song came on - the one you love
You came over to me, looked me in the eyes and said, for sure

You had your hands all over my body tonight
You didn't care about respectability
People starin' 'cause you really made a scene
It must have looked like we were doin' it for real
(You said)

Where I come from, we don't play around
And when it's time to party, we know how to get down
And where we're goin' baby, you don't have to worry 'bout a thing
Take my hand
Move your body up and down
And...

Push up
Your body, your body next to mine
Push up
I gotta make that sexy booty mine
Push up
And shake it, baby shake that ass
Push up
I love it when you feel like gettin' nasty

Just like a drug, you rock with my reality
You were a figment of my sexuality
I know you're capable of blowin' out my mind
So excuse me if when you talk to me, I seem preoccupied

'Cause where I come from, we don't play around
And when its time to party we know how to get down
And where we're goin' baby, you don't have to worry 'bout a thing
Take my hand
Move your body up and down
And...

Push up
Your body, your body next to mine
Push up
I gotta make that sexy booty mine
Push up
And shake it, baby shake that ass
Push up
I love it when you feel like gettin' nasty

(Nasty, nasty, nasty, ...)

Where I come from...uh no
We don't play around (no, no)
And where I come from yeah...
We get down, get down, so
Move your body up and down
And...

Push up
Your body, your body next to mine
Push up
I gotta make that sexy booty mine
Push up
And shake it, baby shake that ass
Push up
I love it when you feel like gettin' nasty

Push up
Your body, your body next to mine
Push up
I gotta make that sexy booty mine
Push up
And shake it, baby shake that ass
Push up
I love it when you feel like gettin' nasty
