[Verse 1]
I can make you dance
I know the world's in a real bad way
I can make you dance if you want me to
But I can make you better, let me show you what it takes baby
I can make you dance if you want me to
Now I got a thang that's sure to make ya wanna moooove
I can make you dance if you want me to
It's controlled by Roger and it's right here in this tube
I can make you dance if you want me to
Now I can set you free from your trouble double time, baby
I can make you dance if you want me to
Just lend me your ears and let your feet keep time, baby
I can make you dance if you want me to
And here's what you'll find about this music of mine, baby
I can make you dance if you want me to
Oh yeah-ah-ah
It'll make you dance [x3]
Make you dance [x2]
It'll make you dance
Ooooo Make you dance

[Chorus]
I can make you dance
I can make you dance
I can make you dance
I can make you dance
Ooooo Baby
I can make you dance
I can make you dance
I can make you dance
I can make you dance
I can make you dance
Cha Cha Cha, Cha Cha Cha, Ahhh

Make you dance [x5]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, mama, make you dance
Now they can raise the price of the food and the rent
I can make you dance if you want me to
But what I offer you won't cost a doggone cent
I can make you dance if you want me to
You can dance in the morning when you eat your cornflakes
I can make you dance if you want me to
Cause God gave me rhythm and that's really all it takes
I can make you dance if you want me to
I can make you dance
You know I can make you dance
I can make you dance
Forget about your 9 to 5

[Chorus]
I can make you dance
I can make you dance
I can make you dance
Yay-yay-yay-yay-uh
I can make you dance
Yes I do
I can make you dance
Make you dance, make you dance, make you dance
I can make you dance
Gonna make you dance, dance, dance, dance
I can make you dance
Make you dance
