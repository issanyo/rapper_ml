[Intro: Keith Sweat]
Let me
Go down on you, baby
Girl, why don't you let me
Go down on you, baby

[Verse 1: Keith Sweat]
Play it for me one time, Roger
Help me (Help me) I need some lovin' (Some good lovin') right, right now
Let me in, let me in, let me in
So let me come in (Would you let me come on in)
Let me make it good (Ooh), let me show you how
Play it for me, Roger, one time

[Chorus: Keith Sweat & Roger Troutman]
I wanna put your lovin' through the test
Let's get it on, mmm
I wanna see how good, good it can get
With my love, my love, girl, you can't go wrong, oh, no, baby
I wanna put your lovin' through the test
Come on, baby, baby, let's get it on
I wanna see how good, good it can get

[Verse 2: Keith Sweat]
Give me your love, baby, mmm (Give me your lovin')
I need right now, right now, baby (I just need you love)
Let me come in, baby (I wanna come on in)
I wanna drive, I wanna drive you wild (Let me drive you wild, let me drive you wild)
Play it for me, Roger, one time

[Chorus: Keith Sweat & Roger Troutman]
I wanna put your lovin' through the test (I wanna put your lovin', baby, through my test)
I wanna see how good, good it can get (I wanna see how good it can get, baby, oh, yeah, baby)
I wanna put your lovin' through the test (I wanna put your lovin', baby, through my, my, my test)
I wanna see how good, good it can get (I wanna see how good it's gonna get)

[Verse 3: Keith Sweat]
Babe, don't afraid
You don't have to be, no, you don't have to be
You can have all of me, all of me tonight, baby
I will make it real good, baby
All you gotta do is lay your body down
Come on, baby
All you gotta do, all you gotta do, all you gotta do
You lay, lay, lay, lay, lay, lay, lay your body down, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby

[Chorus: Keith Sweat & Roger Troutman]
I wanna put your lovin' through the test (Tonight your love will be all mine)
Tonight is gonna be our night
I wanna see how good (Oh, yeah, babe), good it can get (Tonight your love will be all mine)
Your love is gonna be all mine tonight
I wanna put your lovin' (Oh, yeah, sugar) through the test
Tonight is gonna be our night
I wanna see how good (Come on, baby), good it can get (Tonight is gonna be our night)
We'll be dippin', dabbin'
I wanna put your lovin' (All night long) through the test
Tonight your love will be all mine, baby
I wanna see how good (Oh, yes, it will), good it can get
Tonight your love will be all mine
