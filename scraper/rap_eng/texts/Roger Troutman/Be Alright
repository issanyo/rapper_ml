[Verse]
Oh, baby, please don’t ever leave me
Just stick with me, mama, put your hand in mine
We can be together to love and share
To our very last dime, our last meal, our last sip of wine
Yes, we can
Come on, baby (Put your hand in mine)
We share a good thing together
Come on, baby (Put your hand in mine, girl)
Together we can make this journey
Together we can make this journey
Together we can make this journey
Together we can make this journey

[Verse]
Shut your mouth mama, don’t you talk about leaving
No, no, no, no, don’t you head for that door
This little thing we got is gonna work out fine
Work out fine,  work out fine, it’s gonna work out fine
