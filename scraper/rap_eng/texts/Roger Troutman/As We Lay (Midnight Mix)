It's morning
And we slept the night away
It happened
Now we can't turn back the hands of time

Yes we've stolen this moment
We forgot to face, one simple fact
We both belong to someone else
As we slept, the night away

It's morning
Sunlight shines across your sleeping face
A new day
Brings reality that we must go our separate way

What a lovely night, we had, yeah yeah
As we shared each other's love
We forgot about all the pain we'd cause
As we slept the night away

As we lay, we forgot about tomorrow, as we lay
Hey hey, as we lay
We didn't think about the price we'd have to pay
Oh no, no no no no no no no

It's morning
And now it's time for us to say goodbye
Goodbye baby
You're leaving me
I know you got to hurry home to face your wife

I would never never want to hurt her no
She would never understand
You belonged to me for just one night
As we slept the night away

I would never never want to hurt her no no
She'd never understand
You belonged to me for just one night
As we slept the night away

As we lay, we forgot about tomorrow
As we lay, oh as we lay
Didn't think about the price we'd have to pay, oh no hey

We should have counted up the cost
But instead we got lost
In the second, in the minute, in the hour
Hey hey, hey as we lay
We forgot about tomorrow, as we lay

It's morning
It's morning
It's morning
It's morning
It's morning
