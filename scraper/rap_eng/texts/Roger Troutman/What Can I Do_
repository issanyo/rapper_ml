My man done left me on a midnight train
He said he wasn't thinkin of ever comin back again
He told me he wanted me to find somebody else
He done left me here all by myself, tell me
What can I do?
What? I'm still in love with you
What can I do?
What? I'm still in love with you, baby
When it first started it was all good
The things you done to me I never thought that you would
Didn't give me a reason why it had to end
I can't believe you left me for another lady friend
You know I've been searchin for someone
Who could share that special love with me
I thought you were the one, I gave my trust to you
I'm such a fool, I want you back, tell me what am I to do?
What can I do?
What? I'm still in love with you
What can I do?
What? I'm still in love with you, baby
I'm sittin by the phone, all alone
Tell me what can I do, tell me, tell me
What can I do?
What? I'm still in love with you
What can I do?
What? I'm still in love with you, baby
What can I do?
What? I'm still in love with you
What can I do?
What? I'm still in love with you
