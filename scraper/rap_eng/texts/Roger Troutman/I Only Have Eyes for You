Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Could we be on a crowded, crowded avenue

You are here
So am I
Maybe millions and millions and millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I only have eyes for you

Even in my darkest days
Even in my darkest nights
Even when I close my eyes
I see you

Even every step I make
Girl, every breath I take
It's for you (oh)

Even in my darkest days
Even in my darkest nights
Even when I close my eyes
I see you
