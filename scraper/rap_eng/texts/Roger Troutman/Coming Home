Hey Rick, where my money at man?
I ain't do no good, guess I'm going on home
What's happenin' baby?
I ain't doing no good, my baby left me
I'm going on home

I had a lady so sweet, she gave me everything I need
And tried to help me succeed, but I just couldn't be true
I had to chase any skirt I knew, from here to Timbuktu

[Chrous]
I was so wrong, oh won't you forgive me baby
I was so wrong, oh won't you forgive me baby
I was so wrong, oh won't you forgive me baby
I was so wrong, so won't you forgive me baby

For being so wrong to you, because now I'm blue
And I'm coming, right back home to you

Home to you, right back home to you
Home to you, right back home to you
I'm humming and I'm comin', don't ya hear me mama
Da da da, da da da dada
Daba do da da, daba do da

I left the lady, I left the best
I said goodbye woman, cause I'm booking West
I'm going, do do dodo do, right home

I'll be coming back home to you
Do do dodo do do

[Chrous]
I was so wrong, oh won't you forgive me baby
I was so wrong, oh won't you forgive me baby
I was so wrong, oh won't you forgive me baby
I was so wrong, so won't you forgive me baby

If there was no more you, my love, take a back tail spin
Till' back with you baby
Please let me back in (back in, back in, back in, back in)
Please let me back in

Oh, I ain't got nowhere no more
The trip was a dog-gone bore
I lost that other girl, when you swore that you would be true
I took my love from you, you, you

[Chrous]
I was so wrong, oh won't you forgive me baby
I was so wrong, oh won't you forgive me baby
I was so wrong, oh won't you forgive me baby
I was so wrong, so won't you forgive me baby

You had it all right there for me, now its so plain to see
Just where I ought to be (Ought to be, Ought to be, Ought to be)
Ought to be right back with you

Home to you, right back home to you
Home to you, right back home to you
I'm humming and I'm comin', don't ya hear me mama
