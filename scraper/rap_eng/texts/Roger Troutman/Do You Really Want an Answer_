[Hook]
Do you really want an answer?
Do you really want to know?
Do you really want an answer?
Do you really want to know?
Do you really want an answer?
Do you really want to know?

[Verse 1]
I sit here by my window (alone)
And listen to the breeze go
I wonder why it happens
But do I really wanna know?
It seems like just yesterday
I had everything in this whole wide world

[Pre-Hook]
(Where is that girl?) Help me somebody
(Where is that girl?) Help me somebody
(Where is that girl?) Won't somebody tell me?
Where is that girl? Where is that girl? Where is that girl?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Is this really really happening? (Dream)
Am I alone tonight?
I have such a lovely lady
Why couldn't I be right?
She gave me everything I ever needed
With love, warm into the air
What kind of fool was I?
To ever let her go?
Somebody tell me
Where can she be?

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Is there any room, for reconsideration?
My whole world depends, on reconciliation
Have I lost you girl? (Do you really want to know?)
Are you gone for good? (Do you really want to know?)
Somebody told me, they saw you at the club
Sitting with a friend
(Somebody tell me, somebody tell me)
Have you found another love baby?
Have you found another love?

[Extended Hook]
Do you really want an answer?
Do you really want to know?
Do you really want an answer?
Do you really want to know?
Do you really want an answer?
Do you really want to know?
Do you really want an answer?
Do you?
