You told me things
And I believed you more
It disappeared at times
But that did matter at all

Those lonely nights
I waited for your call
I didn't know was
That you were someone's husband

My desire for you is strong
But I won't do wrong
You're that lady's husband
My decency prevails
Yes, it does
And it won't let me keep you, no

So I'm letting you go
Letting you go
So I'm letting you go
Letting you go

You satisfied a real desire in me
Without apologies
I still have those needs
Well, I'm a lady with class
And I know my desire will pass
This cannot [?]
Because you are her husband

My desire for you is strong
And I won't do wrong
'Cause I know in my heart
That you are her
I know
I know you are her husband
That's why I got to let you go

Desire says I should
But I say no
I say no

I might not be all I want to be
I've been a fool before
And I do things I deplore
But after you
If Shirley's gonna be a fool
A fool for any man
That man has got to be my husband

My desire for you is strong
And I won't do wrong
So I'm letting you go
Letting you go
So I'm letting you go
Letting you go

Because you are her husband

My desire for you is strong
And I won't do wrong
Cause I know in my heart
That you are her husband
I know
I know you are her husband
That's why I got to let you go

Desire says I should
But I say no
My body says I should
But I say no

Mister, you say I should
But I say no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Desire says I should
I say no
