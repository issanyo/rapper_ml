Radio, radio
On my radio
Radio

You can find it all on your radio
On your radio

Whenever I'm alone
And I need (I need, I need)
Some company (radio)

You know I
Have a friend (have a friend)
That I can listen to
On my radio

Stereophonic, groovalistic, realistic, superalistic
Whatever's right for you

You can find it all on your radio
On your radio (on your radio)
You can find it all on your radio
On your radio (on your radio)
You can find it all on your radio
On your radio

You don't need nobody
You just touch the special dial
On your radio

W-Z-A-P, Zapp
W-Z-A-P
W-Z-A-P
Zapp Radio

Whatever sounds you like
The music plays all night
You can find it all
On your radio
On your radio

Whoa, radio
You can find it all on your radio
On your radio

You can find it all on your radio
On your radio
Radio

I like my radio
I like my radio

In the morning
Your DJ wakes you up
In the afternoon
You can take him on the freeway
Late at night
He'll still be there for you (for you)
On your radio

You get music on
Your radio
Radio, radio

You can find it all on your radio
On your radio
On your radio (radio)
Whoa radio
You can find it all on your radio
On your radio
On your radio
You can find it all on your radio
On your radio (on your radio)
You can find it all on your radio
On your radio (on your radi-radio)
You can find it all on your radio
On your radio (on your radi-radio)
Whoa radio
You can find it all on your radio
On your radio
