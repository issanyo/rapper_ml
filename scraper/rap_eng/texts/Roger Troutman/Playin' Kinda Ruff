I wake up every morning
My neighbors screaming, alarm clock ringing
I wish I could lay back down
Now I got such a sweet lady
Well sometimes I wonder why
Why she sticks around
Because the pieces just don't fall in place
Stand up, be a man
Sure getting tuff out here
Playing kind of ruff, sure gettn' tuff out here
It's tuff, its ruff out here

[Verse 2]
Need some money and a job
Lord its ruff, yes its ruff out here
My job, good lord
Have mercy, my job
The man is on my back 8 hours of day
Lift that bale, tote that barge
Mercy, mercy boss man
I wanna quit, pack it in, give it up, walk away
I can't quit, just can't quit
My woman, my babies are depending on me
And I can't duck responsibilities
Do what I can to beat the man
Sure getting tuff out here

Playing kind of ruff, sure gettn' tuff out here
It's tuff, its ruff out here
Playing kind of ruff, sure gettn' tuff out here
It's tuff, its ruff out here
Playing kind of ruff, sure gettn' tuff out here
It's tuff, its ruff out here

It's Friday, the eagle flies
I take my money straight home
It's Friday, the eagle flies
My money looks awful funny
Just can't understand
How they calculate this tax
This tax, that tax
Doing nothing else but paying a bunch of tax
Now I got such a sweet lady
She makes me feel everything is alright

Playing kind of ruff, sure gettn' tuff out here
It's tuff, its ruff out here
Playing kind of ruff, sure gettn' tuff out here
It's tuff, its ruff out here
Playing kind of ruff, sure gettn' tuff out here
It's tuff, its ruff out here
Playing kind of ruff, sure gettn' tuff out here
It's tuff, its ruff out here
