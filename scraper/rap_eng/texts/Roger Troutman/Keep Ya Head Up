[Intro: Lyfe Jennings]
Yeah
This song was such a helluva song that I felt it was necessary that I bring it back
And I just kind of, like, came along with the song, ha ha
This ya boy Lyfe Jennings, or rather yo, ya ya ya boy 2Pac
Check it out

[Verse 1: Lyfe Jennings]
Some say the darker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
Holla for my sistas on welfare
Lyfe cares if don't nobody else care (Don't nobody else care)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women?
Do we hate our women?
I think it's time we kill for our women
Time to heal our women
Be real to our women
Or we would have a race of babies
That would hate the ladies that make the babies
Will the real men get up?
Ladies, I know you fed up
But you gotta

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
Keep your head up
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Oh, hold on to faith, babe
Keep your head up
Ooh child, things are gona get easier
All you gotta do is believe

[Verse 2: Lyfe Jennings]
I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
Had me feeling like black was the thing to be
Suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
Though we had it rough
Always had enough (Always had enough)
Realizing momma really paid the price
And nearly gave her life to raise me right, yeah
And though you was a crack fiend mama
You always was a black queen mama
And ooh, child of mine
To all the ladies havin babies on their own (Havin' babies on your own)
I know it's kind of rough (I know it's rough)
And you're feelin' alone (I know you feeling alone)
But better days are comin' (Better days are comin')

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
Keep your head up
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Oh, hold on to faith, babe
Keep your head up
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
All you gotta do is believe
This for all my 2Pac Fans
All my 2Pac fans

[Verse 3: Kids & (Lyfe Jennings)]
When he tell you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause sista, you don't need him
And I ain't tryna gas you up, I just call it like I see it
You know what makes me unhappy (What's that?)
When brothas make babies and leave the young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I know that gets you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive and don't forget, girl

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
Keep your head up
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
(Thank you, L.A., we owe you for this one, L.A.)
Oh, hold on to faith, babe
Keep your head up
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
All you gotta do is believe, yeah

[Outro: Lyfe Jennings & Kid]
Keep your head, head up
Keep your head up, ooh
Keep ya head up
Keep ya head up
Keep your head up
Keep ya head up
Keep ya head up
This all I got to say, is keep your head up
