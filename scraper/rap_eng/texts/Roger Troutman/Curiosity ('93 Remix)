[Intro]
Curiosity
So mysterious

[Chorus]
I've been watching you, I'm curious
I've been watching every move you make
I love the way you move, you're mysterious
You and me could be two lovers, don't make me wait
Curiosity, yeah yeah
I'm so curious (curiosity)
You're so mysterious (so mysterious)
I'm so curious
I've got to know ya, I've got to know ya, I've got to know ya

[Verse 1]
Driving in my car
Just who is that star?
She starts my curiosity
Curiosity, curiosity
I slapped on the brakes
'Cause there's no time to waste
I must catch her before she leaves
Curiosity, curiosity
She's in my rearview
Does she see me too?
I think it's time for face-to-face
Curiosity, curiosity
Up to her, I cruise
But, what shall I do?
And then, she's gone without a trace

[Chorus]
I've been watching you, I'm curious
I've been watching every move you make
I love the way you move, you're mysterious
You and me could be two lovers, don't make me wait
Curiosity, yeah yeah
I'm so curious (curiosity)
You're so mysterious (so mysterious)
I'm so curious
I've got to know ya, I've got to know ya, I've got to know ya

[Verse 2]
All night shop-and-stop
And it's 12 O'clock
I watched her go in the store
Curiosity, curiosity
I was headed for the flat
There's no time for that
I walked slowly to the door
Curiosity, curiosity
I go in behind her
I must try and find her
But she's nowhere to be found
Curiosity, curiosity
I dash out through the check-out
'Cause I see her step out
Curiosity has me bound

[Chorus]
I've been watching you, I'm curious
I've been watching every move you make
I love the way you move, you're mysterious
You and me could be two lovers, don't make me wait
Curiosity, yeah yeah
I'm so curious (curiosity)
You're so mysterious (so mysterious)
I'm so curious
I've got to know ya, I've got to know ya

[Verse 3]
Now is the time for the bottom line
I'm curious about you girl 'cause you're cold-cut fine
If beauty were a cry you'd be doing time
So what I'm saying is that I wanna make you mine
And when you are mine, I can make you see
That the place to be is right here with me
So let's not waste this opportunity
Come on baby, let's get busy

[Outro]
(curiosity)
Come here baby (curiosity)
I'm so curious (curiosity)
What's your name? (curiosity)
Wait a minute baby (curiosity)
Wait a minute mama (curiosity)
Said I'm curious (curiosity)
Yes, I'm curious (curiosity)
Said, I'm curious (curiosity)
