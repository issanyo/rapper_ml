[Verse 1: Curtis Mayfield]
We people who are darker than blue
Don't let us hang around this town
And let what others say come true?
We're just good for nothing they all figure
A boyish, grown up, shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at?
We people who are darker than blue
We got no time for segregatin'
Let's talk 'bout brown and yellow two
High yellow girl, can't you tell
You're just the surface of our dark deep well
If your mind could really see
You'd know your color; same as me
Pardon me, brother, as you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story

[Talkbox Solo: Roger Troutman]
Get yourself together, learn to know your side
Shall we commit our own genocide
Before you check out your mind?

[Verse 2: Curtis Mayfield]
Now I know we have great respect
For the sister, and mother it's even better yet
But there's the joker in the street
Loving one brother and killing the other
When the time comes and we are really free
There'll be no brothers left you see
We people who are darker than blue
Don't let us hang around this town
And let what others say come true
We're just good for nothing they all figure
A boyish, grown up, shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at?
Pardon me, brother, while you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story
Pardon me, brother, I know we've come a long, long way
But let us not be so satisfied for tomorrow can be an even brighter day
