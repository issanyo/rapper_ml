Motherfuckers better know
Yeah

A Shaded jay hella set
Like a Teflon Vest
I'm Here to bring the realist
Illest shit and never the less
Fatal attraction
A distraction to the opposite sex
You'll never see
A basterd like he on the radio
Bet
I'll top the billboards
Oh lord
Only if you let me
Different shades of jay
K
Please don't upset me
I need checks see
See Everything else is simply stressing
Quit messing
With the moment hoe
Adore my flexing
And the next thing
You know
I'ma glow like
Uranium
My words and my flow bro
All up in ya cranium
I'ma follow my plan
And have enough fans to fill a stadium
*Are you really gonna pay for him*
Hell yea
Tomorrow and today
The shaded Jay
From Philadelphia
OK?
I know its California
But what can i say
I wanted to play
