You made my day
You came my way
You heard me every, every time I prayed

You gave me peace
You gave me grace
You put a smile upon my face

You brought the sunshine
Threw out the lifeline
You brought the sunshine
Threw out the lifeline

You made my day
You came my way
You heard me every, every time I prayed

You gave me peace
You gave me grace
You put a smile upon my face

You brought the sunshine
Threw out the lifeline
You brought the sunshine
Threw out the lifeline

Jesus is the Answer, He breaks every fetter
It really doesn't matter

No matter what the problem, God can always solve'm
Cast your cares upon him

You brought the sunshine & threw out the lifeline

You made, you made my day
You came, you came my way
