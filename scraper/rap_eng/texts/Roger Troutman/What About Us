Come and talk to me
Can I talk to you?
Come and talk to me

[JoJo + Devante Swing]
I wanna love you (Repeat 8X)
Check this out...JoJo...

[Verse 1: JoJo]
Girl, I'm reaching out my hand
Trying to make you understand
That you don't have to be alone
'Cause I wanna be your man
Girl, I need you in my life
Just wanna live right by your side
So girl I won't be satisfied
Until you give this love a try

[Chorus]
I'm in need of love
And baby you're in need of love
So what about us?
On and on and on 'til the break of dawn, it's on
I'm in need of love
And baby you're in need of love
So what about us?
On and on and on 'til the break of dawn, it's on

[JoJo]
Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel me?
I can feel you lady

[Verse 2: JoJo]
Satisfaction guaranteed
If you come and get with me
Girl, I can get down on my knees
So let me please let me (do you lady)
'Cause I know just what you need (I need your love)
I need your love
Girl, would you listen to me

[Chorus: Jodeci + (JoJo ad-libs)]
I'm in need of love
And baby you're in need of love
So what about us?
On and on and on 'til the break of dawn, it's on
(I'm in need of love, I'm in need of love)
I'm in need of love
And baby you're in need of love
So what about us? (I wanna love you)
On and on and on 'til the break of dawn, it's on

[Bridge]
Shoobie doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop, I wanna love you
(I wanna love you, baby)
Shoobie doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop, I wanna love you

Shoobie doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop, I wanna love you
(I wanna love you, baby)
Shoobie doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop, I wanna love you

[Chorus: Jodeci + (K-Ci ad-libs)]

And baby you're in need of love (You're in need)
So what about us?
On and on and on 'til the break of dawn, it's on
(I don't know, I don't know what to do...)
I'm in need of love (...if I can't be with you)
And baby you're in need of love (Do you want me?)
So what about us?
On and on and on 'til the break of dawn, it's on

[JoJo]
