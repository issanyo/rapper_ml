[Verse 1:]
Before you left me
I had it all
You were with me
And that was enough

He came along
And I forgot all about you
I was a fool
But I'm wiser now

[Chorus:]
Because you left
My world came to an end
(I tell you my world came to an end)
Then you came back again
(Then you brought it all together again)

Now I know
(Ooh)
There is no (there's no way) way
(There's no way)
I can go on without you
(I can go on without you)
You

[Verse 2:]
A precious love
You took from me
Opened my eyes
And now I can see

A one night affair
Can be so unfair
But I paid the price
So I'm wiser now

[Repeat Chorus x2:]


[Verse 3:]
Never again
Will I let you go
Now that you're home
I missed you so

Mmm, hmm
I love you forever
Cause you've earned my love

And I just wanna say
It's because of you
I'm wiser now

[Chorus:]
Because you left
(Because you left)
My world came to an end
(You see, my world came to an end)
Then you came back
(Nobody but you) again
(Oh, you came back again)

Now I know
(I want the whole world to know)
There is no (you see, there's no way) way
(No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no way)
I can go on
(I can't make it without you)

You left
(Oh, oh, ho)
My world came to an end
(Came to an end)
Then you came back again
(Then, oh, then you came back again)
Now I know
(You see, I know)

There is no (there's no way) way
(No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no way)
I can go on with you
(I can go on without you, you)

I can't go on without you
