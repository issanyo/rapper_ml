You told me things and I believed you more
It disappeared at times but that did matter at all
Those lonely nights, I waited for your call
I didn't know was that you were someone's husband

My desire for you is strong but I won't do wrong
You're that lady's husband
My decency prevails
Yes, it does and it won't let me keep you, no
So I'm letting you go, letting you go
So I'm letting you go, letting you go

You satisfied a real desire in me without apologies
I still have those needs
Well I'm a lady with class and I know my desire will pass
This cannot [unverified] because you are her husband

My desire for you is strong and I won't do wrong
'Cause I know in my heart that you are he
I know, I know you are her husband
That's why I got to let you go
Desire says I should but I say, no, I say, no

I might not be all I want to be
I've been a fool before, and I do things I deplore
But after you, if Shirley's gonna be a fool
A fool for any man, that man has got to be my husband

My desire for you is strong, and I won't do wrong
So I'm letting you go, letting you go
So I'm letting you go, letting you go

Because you are her husband

My desire for you is strong and I won't do wrong
'Cause I know in my heart that you are her husband
I know, I know you are her husband
That's why I got to let you go
Desire says I should but I say, no

My body says I should but I say no
Mister you say I should but I say no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Desire says I should, I say no
