When I woke up this morning
The very first thing I saw was your face
Mmm, hmm
Dawn cannot erase the memory
Or the magic that we made
Hmm, hmm

My heart skips a beat
As I watch you while you sleep
For my heart is the window to my soul
And true love is what I see
When you look at me
When you look at me

In your eyes
I see kindness
In your eyes
I see honesty
In your eyes
I see patience
Oh, baby
In your eyes
I see love

When I woke up this morning
I saw you
And felt so warm inside
So warm inside
Nothing is impossible
With you right here by my side

And every night before I sleep
I thank the Lord for blessing me with you
And true love is what I see
When you look at me
When you look at me

In your eyes
I see kindness
In your eyes
I see honesty
In your eyes
I see patience

Oh, baby
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
I see love
In your eyes
