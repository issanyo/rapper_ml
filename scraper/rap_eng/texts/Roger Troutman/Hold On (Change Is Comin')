[Intro]
Hold on, don't worry 'bout a thang

I, I, I know that you've been waiting, just hold on
Change is comin' (Change is comin')
I, I, I know that you've been waiting, just hold on (Hold on)
Change is comin' (Change is comin')

[Verse 1]
Yesterday, a man stepped to me, he said
"How can you smile when your world is crumbling down?"
I said, "Here's my secret when I wanna cry" (Don't you cry)
"I take a look around and I see that I'm getting by
And I hold on"

[Chorus]
Hold on (hold on), change is coming (change is comin')
Hold on (hold on), don't ya worry (don't worry 'bout a thang)
Hold on (hold on), you can make it (you can make it)
Hold on (hold on), everything (everything will be alright)

[Verse 2]
Some people like to worry (They like to worry)
Some people like to hide (They like to hide)
Some people like to run away (Run away)
From the pain inside
Now that's your business, hmm
Do whatever you wanna do (Whatever you want)
But if it don't work out, here's what you ought to do
Now just hold on

[Chorus]
Hold on (hold on), change is coming (change is comin')
Hold on (hold on), don't worry (don't worry 'bout a thang)
Hold on (hold on), you can make it (you can make it)
Hold on (hold on), everything (everything will be alright)
It's gonna be alright

[Bridge]
When the troubles of life, weigh ya down
Just lift your head up, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
When the love you seek is hard to find
Don't give up, just be strong, keep the faith
And hold on

[Chorus]
Hold on (hold on), change is coming (change is comin')
Hold on (hold on), everything's gonna be alright (don't worry 'bout a thang)
Hold on (hold on), said you can make it (you can make it)
Hold on (hold on), everything (everything will be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright

Hold on, (change is comin') change is comin'
(Hold on) hold on, don't worry 'bout a thang
(Hold on) hold on, (change is comin') change is comin'
(Hold on) hold on, don't worry 'bout a thang

La la, la la, la la, la la
La la, la la, la la, la la

[Chorus]
Now hold on (hold on), change is coming (change is comin')
Hold on (hold on), don't you worry (don't worry 'bout a thang)
Hold on (hold on), I said you can make it (you can make it)
Hold on (hold on), everything (everything will be alright)
Everything is gonna be alright
