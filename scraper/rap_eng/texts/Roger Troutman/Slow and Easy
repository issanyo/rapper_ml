[Verse 1]
Tonight I came home early
'Cause I just couldn't wait to see you
You were on my mind
Lately I've been thinkin', baby (Yeah, I've been thinkin')
Of all the ways I can make you happy
And tonight I'm gonna try

[Pre-Chorus]
So just unwind (Just unwind)
Relax your mind (Relax your mind)
Leave your cares behind (Leave them behind)
Let's make love (Nice and slow)

[Chorus]
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy, oh yeah)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Wanna love you tonight, yeah)
Slow and easy

[Verse 2]
As we lay we can
Just explore each other's treasures
They're not hard to find
We know the secret (Yeah)
Of how to make each other happy
I know yours and you know mine

[Pre-Chorus]
So just unwind (Just unwind)
Relax your mind (Relax your mind)
Leave your cares behind (Leave them behind)
Let's make love (All I wanna do is make sweet love to you)

[Chorus]
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy, oh yeah)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(I wanna take my time)
Slow and easy (Slow and easy)

[Verse 3]
Come to me, baby
No, no, no there's no need to worry
The kids are all asleep, yeah yeah yeah
I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
I can see it in your eyes, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Just unwind (You better unwind, girl)
Relax your mind (Relax your mind)
Leave your cares behind (Baby, won't you leave your cares behind)
Let's make love (All I wanna do, all I wanna do is make love)

[Chorus]
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(I wanna love you slow and easy)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Let's make love, yeah)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(We don't have to worry 'bout nothing else)
Slow and easy (Slow, yeah)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(I wanna take my time)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy, oh yeah)
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
(That's the way I wanna love you)
Slow and easy (Slow and easy)

[Outro]
Slow and easy (Shooby doo bop, slow and easy)
Slow and easy (Shooby doo bop, slow and easy)
Slow and easy (Shooby doo bop, slow and easy)
Slow and easy
