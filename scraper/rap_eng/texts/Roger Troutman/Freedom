You got to uh!

If I got a Ham Hock and a pot of beans
2, 3 quarters in my pocket, a real clean place to go

I need to be off of work, with 4
I don't wanna get drunk, cause I don't want show my behind
But I need one pint of wine

[Chorus]
You got to uh!
Free, free freedom
Shu, do wop bop
Free, free freedom
Gimme, gimme
Free, free freedom
Spot-n-do bop
Free, free freedom
Shu, do wup bop
Free, free freedom
Gimme, gimme
Free, free freedom
Spot-n-do bop

Ma, my lets just get in
So I turn down the lights, turn up my music
And let my lady take my mind
All my troubles, all my troubles yeah
To me this is freedom, and you ain't nowhere
Oh no, no, you get yourself some

[Chorus]
You got to uh!
Free, free freedom
Shu, do wup bop
Free, free freedom
Gimme, gimme
Free, free freedom
Spot-n-do bop
Free, free freedom
Shu, do wup bop
Free, free freedom
Gimme, gimme
Free, free freedom
Spot-n-do bop
