[Verse 1: H-Town & Roger Troutman]
[H-Town]
It's a thin line, it's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I'm just getting in, I knock on the door
A voice sweet and low says, who is it?
She opens up the door and lets me in
Never do she once say, sir, where have you been?
No, she says, are you hungry?
Are you hungry, honey?
[Roger Troutman]
Did you eat yet?
[H-Town; Roger Troutman]
Let me hang up your coat, your coat, your coat
[H-Town]
And the woman tells me, pass me your hat too
All the time she smiles, never raises her voice
It's 5 o'clock in the morning

[Hook: H-Town]
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

[Verse 2: H-Town]
The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way
You keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That'll really really hurt you one day

Here I am laying in the hospital
Bandaged from feet to head
Ya see I'm in the state of shock baby
Just that much from being dead
I didn't think my woman could do something like this to me
I didn't think she had the nerve, so here I am
I guess action speaks louder than words

[Hook: H-Town]
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

[Verse 3: Shirley Murdock]
The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way
You keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That could hurt you one day

[Hook: H-Town]
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

[Bridge: H-Town & Roger Troutman]
[H-Town]
It's a thin line (It's a thin line)
Between love and hate (You know it is)
It's a thin line
[Roger Troutman]
Shoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin line
[H-Town]
It's a thin line (It's a thin line)
Between love and hate (You know it is)
It's a thin line
[Roger Troutman]
Shoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin line
[H-Town]
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
[Roger Troutman]
Shoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin line
