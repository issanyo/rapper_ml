[Part I: California Love]

[Audience Applause]

[Verse: 2Pac]
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down, give me love!

[Chorus: 2Pac]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
Keep it rocking
Keep it rocking

[Spoken Word: 2Pac]
California Love
Death Row
Let's take 'em to church

[Part II: So Many Tears]

[Spoken Word: 2Pac]
My homeboy
This goes out to my homeboy [?]
If there ain't no justice for the dawg
Ain't no justice whatsoever

[Verse 1]
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? See the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord, I suffered through the years (C'mon wit' it)
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
