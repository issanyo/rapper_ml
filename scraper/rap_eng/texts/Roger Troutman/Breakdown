Breakdown!

[Hook]
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down

[Verse 1: Poc Fu]
I gets so busy on the mic with my rythmic flows
That's bound to leave you bangin' when it gets exposed
'Cause the way I could display my style is wicked
So run up to your counters, and go and get your tickets
I know you got dreams of roasting me hot
But I got flavor like that candy in your grocery shop
The dramatical, craft-matical, soul fanatic
An addict, with the crazy flow that's automatic
Flowin' like them bolts from the sky like Zeus
An old schooler, who drops mathematics like a ruler
Or protractor, you don't have no knack to
Hang with me, come with the steez and see I'm no actor
That shit is real homeslice, so bring your own dice
So we call roll, gonna lose, I'm takin' all your dough
Punch you in your eye and come raid your town
With the sound full of spunk as we break it down
'Cause it's...

[Hook]
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down

[Verse 2: Chip Fu]
Ah, ah, aah, achoo!
What to do? Timbuck-one, timbuck-two
I can't see a t'ing like Mr. Magoo
The sniffling, huh-huh-ha
C-c-c-coughing, achoo!
Stuffy, naughty, nappy jack-in-a-box, dreadlocks rocks
So na, hic-up, na, hic, what's up? Tic-tic-tock, oops!
Shiver me timber now boots
Oh my gosh, oh my goose
Shucks, yo now I huh, now I huh, eeh, got the hic-ups
And I rips up many tracks, jumpin' Jehosaphat
Don't make a sound, I see you wabbit
Tracks, like thunder and lightning
My style frightening, can't you tell?
I'm loco, ooh, they don't know me very well, so
I lumps 'em, eeh, bruise 'em with black eyes and stitches
They're mad, keeh, 'cause we went from rags into riches
Now my scruples, I lose 'em
Damage, I do some
I'm two-faced kid, so call me the gruesome two-some
I got secrets, but I don't know
Like Yoko, I'm Ono
I'm changing, visions blurry, so call me, I'm Quasimoto
And yo, I'll switch up, hic-up!
Switch up, hic-up!
Switch up, hic-up!
Switch-up, hii!
With or without the hic-ups, those emcees quickly pack up
Then I freaks my Fu-Schnick style wild to the microphone
Yo, peep it
And I freaks it, hic-up!
Freaks it, hic-up!
When I freaks it with my drunken technique
I'm makin' pips squeak
But now it's back to the lagoon, way up shit's creek
And don't sleep, when it's time to creep
We roll mad deep, and if the shit gets kind of thick
Here comes the five six fleet to break you down

[Hook]
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down

[Verse 3: Moc Fu]
The funk makes me tipsy, got the whisky
Yo, can this be the funkdafied horror
Tomorrow I'll flip tip
See, er, the blur in my eyes rectifies
That the funk freak me, so peep me as I speak the grammar
I rocks my bandana, shave my head clean
And on my screens than Vanna White
How should I roll when I write?
Then light the spliff, now it's time to recite
A verse, a hearse you be leavin' in
Believe me when I say what I feel, and it's real, not like TV
And science fiction, my addiction is the funk
With more fumes than a skunk, 'cause I'm bound to jump
So check the sound

Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down (breakdown!)
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
