Ba ba ba, ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba (Mmm...mmm...)
Ooh....ooh...ooh... (Oh, yeah)
Ah...ah...ah...ah...

I can tell it's real
That glow I feel
Not like it was before I know
You make happiness abound

You have brought me a true love
Like never before
And if you will just let me
I'll spend my whole life with you

Ba ba ba, ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ooh...ooh...ooh... (Just spend my, spend my life with you, baby)
Ah...ah...ah...ah...

If have such a blessed day
To have you in my life
I have in life one desire
That desire is to make you my wife

Words could not express it
No, no, not this
I guess I better prepare
To spend my whole life with you

Ba ba ba, ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ooh...ooh...ooh...
Ah...ah...ah...ah...

If I live forever
I will still need some more time
To let you know just what I feel
That time here forever ain't quite enough

Still I need to express it
This love I feel for you
I guess the best that I can do
Is spend my whole life with you

Ba ba ba, ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ooh...ooh...ooh...
Ah...ah...ah...ah...

Ooh...
Hoo...hoo...hoo...
I, baby
I want to spend my whole life with you
