[Verse 1]
It's 8 O'clock and
I can't wait to get to work cause
I know that I'll see you there (Love incorporated)
Her desk is down the hall
How I wish that I could call
To tell her my love is hers

[Hook]
We work together so lets be lovers
We work together so lets be lovers

[Verse 2]
Too shy to ask her if she
Belongs to anyone else
I see no ring on her finger (Love incorporated)
I'm standing there at her desk
Wondering which words will work best
When our eyes meet it's just love
Lets start a love incorporated

[Hook]
We work together so lets be lovers
We work together so lets be lovers
Everybody needs some love sometimes (Yes they do)
Everybody needs a love incorporated
Everybody needs some love sometimes
Everybody needs a love incorporated
Love incorporated
We work together so lets be lovers
We work together so lets be lovers

[Verse 3]
This time I'm gonna speak for real
Gonna tell her just how I feel
Even if she doesn't love me (Love incorporated)
Now we're standing face-to-face
And she forces me to wait
She tells me that she's in love (Love incorporated)
She was in love as can be
But she did not want me to see
That she was in love with me
She knows it's me right from the start
She know I can share her heart
She looked at me and said "Lets have a love incorporated"
Lets start a love incorporated

[Hook]
We work together so lets be lovers
We work together so lets be lovers
(Love incorporated) to be your friend
(Love incorporated) Give me your love
(Love incorporated) You are the one
(Love incorporated) I'll be bankin' on you

[Bridge]
I wanna make an investment in you
Let me spend my time on you
We could build our own love incorporated
Me for you, you for me
I'm thinkin' baby, on spending my life with you

[Hook]Ã—2
(Love incorporated) to be your friend
(Love incorporated) Give me your love
(Love incorporated) You are the one
(Love incorporated) I'll be bankin' on you
