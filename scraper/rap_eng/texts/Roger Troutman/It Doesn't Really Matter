[Intro]
Roger! Roger! Fresh!
Roger! Roger! So!
Roger! Roger! Fresh!
Fr-fr-fr-fr-fr-fr-fresh!
Ha ha ha ha...

[Verse 1]
I remember when I was younger
James Brown was so unique
I never understood how he did it
How he made his music groove your very soul

If you listen close to the music
You’ll find no difference between now and then, no
My synthes-istic humanistic sound’ll groove you, yeah

[Chorus]
It doesn't really matter, it doesn't really change
It doesn't really matter, it all remains the same
It doesn't really matter, it doesn't really change
It doesn't really matter, it all remains the same

[Verse 2]
Do you remember Chuck Berry
He made us rock around the clock
Just keep on rockin' and reelin'
And rockin' and reelin', and rockin' all night

Let's rock
C'mon!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
It doesn't really matter, it doesn't really change
It doesn't really matter, it all remains the same
It doesn't really matter, it doesn't really change
It doesn't really matter, it all remains the same
It doesn't really matter, it doesn't really change
It doesn't really matter, it all remains the same...

[Bridge]
Down, down, down, down
It really doesn’t matter, it all remains the same...

[Outro]
Time after time, day after day
It doesn't matter things remain the same
It doesn't matter, matter, matter, matter, matter

Oh, there’s no doubt about it
Things remain the same
Oh, there’s no doubt about it
Dum-dum-dum-dum, bop

Oh, there’s no doubt about it
It never really changes
Oh, there’s no doubt about it
Do-do, do-do, do

Stevie Wonder, Rick James
Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band
Roger Troutman and the Zapp Band
Cameo and Grandmaster
Aretha, she's the queen
James Brown, he's the king
So me, you're the king
Oh Melba Moore, I Love You More
They sound so good to me
Do you remember Sly Stone?
(What city did he come from Roger?)

First, there was Detroit
Then there was Stax
In Memphis
Then the Philly Sound
Now we've got the Minneapolis connection

Thank you Prince 'cause you sound so good to me
Get on down, get on down
Down, down, down, down...
