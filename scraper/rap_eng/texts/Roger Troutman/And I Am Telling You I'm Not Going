And I am telling you I'm not going
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I can ever go
No, no, no, no way
No, no, no, no way I'm living without you

I'm not living without you
I don't wanna be free
I'm staying, I'm staying
And you, and you, you're gonna love me, hey
You're gonna love me, yes, you are, ooh

And I am telling you I'm not going
Even though the rough times are showing
There's just no way, there's no way

We're part of the same place
We're part of the same time
We both share the same blood
We both have the same mind

And time and time, we've had so much to fear
No, no, no, no, no, no
I'm not waking up tomorrow morning
Just to find there's nobody there

Darling, there's no way
No, no, no, no way I'm living without you
I'm not living without you
There's just no way, there's no way

Tear down the mountains, yell, scream and shout
And you can say what you want, I'm not walking out
Stop all the rivers, push back and kill
I'm not gonna leave you, there's no way I will

And I am telling you I'm not going
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I can ever, ever go
No, no, no, no way

No, no, no, no way I'm living without you
Yeah, I'm not living without, not living without you
I don't wanna be free
I'm staying, I'm staying

And you, and you, and you, you're gonna love me
Can't nobody tell me you don't love me
I know, I know that you love me
I know you love me, I know you love me

I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
Love, love, love me, whoa, I know you love me
