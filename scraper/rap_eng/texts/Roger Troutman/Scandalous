[Hook: Roger Troutman]
Uh, uh it's so scandalous (Scandalous)
Uh, it's really get scandalous (Scandalous)
Ooh, scandalous (Scandalous)
Uh, scandalous (Scandalous)

[E-40]
Yeah, don't allow no speaks
We play for keeps among these darkened streets
No peace, half of them fools I went to school with are deceased
Sad, especially when your rag don't come from much
I'm doin' bad, but they call me playboy
Partner came through in the clutch, reached out and touched
And I want the Chips Ahoy without the milk and honey
I ain't no punkish fool, steady missin' money
Steady missin' fetti, Eddie steady missin' scrill
I'm tryin' to make enough allowance to pay my water bill

[D-Shot]
Growin' up wasn't that cool to me
I didn't have that many friends just enemies
Until I quit school and started slangin' dope
Came up and wanted a lil' mo'
Mo' mail, clientele yo that sells
Humongous clout, tryin' hard not to fail
Boss ballin' feelin' my way this mo' each day
Out smartin fools tryin' to have it my way

[Suga-T]
Well, how can a cutie come so so tight
Everybody and they mama got a gat so don't nobody be wantin' to fight
Haters be out there bad tryin' to impress their foes
Pimps turn em' out and then they grow up to be sad-a-pus
Gotta keep a child because I'm tryin to get paid
Yeah, gotta shake these city slickers outta my way
But now mother's day I didn't like a hold on, amen
Stay strong, through it all, do it all
Cause folks is straight scandalous

[Hook]
Scandalous, shit is gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, it's really gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous yeah
Scandalous, it's really gettin' scandalous yeah

[B-Legit]
I'm off in this game, runnin' thangs tryin to get it
I do what I do but I'm true when I spit it
Talk about the time when the grind did me bad
Broke in my pad, took everything I had
Left me with the fo' maybe I can trade her in
Rent's due and all I got is a fen
Knots in my stomach can't understand this
Fools in the town becomin' scandalous

[E-40]
I know some things that'll stun ya, make ya wonder
I seen the scandalous use their children social security number
I seen fiends make pipes outta ink pens
Commit incest throw they body at they own kids
Playas become haters, if they ain't doin' it now they doin' it later
Oh you ain't heard man this here's startin' to be contagious
Can't be sittin' in the cabinet collectin' dust
Plus, man this life is so scandalous

[Hook]
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous
Scandalous, really gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous

[D-Shot]
I remember sittin' in the pen
On the pool table hopin' that I win
Ten packs of some noodles, coffee, and some cigarettes
Tryin' to get penitentiary rich
It seems fools don't wanna pay
My source of income depends on day to day
Nobody on the streets cares for me
No packages or no messages

[B-Legit]
Scandocious, keep my focus would ya feel me
Got me thinkin' people close to me tryin to kill me
That's why I ride with this hill side mean mug
Bust ueys and only smoke with the lueys
The other day they was plottin' on my homie Dre
Tried to slip him a mickey in his Bombay
But now we knowin' not to fall for the oakey-doakey
Brings his own bottle and his smokes

[Suga-T]
I was left in the dark scene had to run
Did what I had to do, kept my game tight and never wonderin'
Credit card scandals, boostin' falsified checks
Takin chances, scandalous

[Suga-T impersonating Shirley Murdock]
You know times are so scandalous
What should we do, just keep on movin'
Close your eyes, have that flow
Could it be your face I see up in these scandalous dreams

[Hook to fade]
