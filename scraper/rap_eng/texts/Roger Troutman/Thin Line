[Verse 1]
Its five o'clock in the morning and I'm just getting in
I knock on the door yeah and a voice sweet and low says
"Who is it"?
She opened up the door and let me in
Never did she once say "where have you been" oh
She said "are you hungry", are you hungry honey?
Did you eat yet?
Let me hang up your coat your coat your coat
And the woman tells me pass me your hat too
All the time she's mine, never raises her voice and its five o'clock in the morning

[Chorus]
Its a thin line between love and hate
Its a thin line between love and hate
Its a thin line between love and hate

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh
The sweetest woman in the world could be the meanest woman in the world
You keep on hurting her, she keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
Oh Oh mmm
Here I am laying in the hospital
Bandaged from feet to head
You see im in the state of shock yeah
Just that much from being dead
I didn't think my woman could do something like this to me
I didn't think she had the nerve
So here I am oh mmm
I guess action speaks louder than words

[Chorus]
Its a thin line between love and hate
Its a thin line between love and hate

[Bridge]
Ooh sang it for me lady

[Chorus]
Its a thin line between love and hate
Its a thin line between love and hate
Its a thin line between love and hate
Its a thin line between love and hate
Its a thin line between love and hate
