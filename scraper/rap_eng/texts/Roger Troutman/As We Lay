Baby, baby, baby

Spoken:

Sometimes, an innocent moment can cause pain to someone that you really love
I found myself in a situation where the only enemy I had was time
You know, I really meant for things to go one way
But, as it turned out, morning was upon me
And the pain of innocence turned into heartache

Verse 1:

It's morning, and we slept the night away
It happened, now we can't turn back the hands of time, no no baby
Yes we've stolen this moment
We forgot to face one simple fact
We both belong to someone else
As we slept the night away

Verse 2:

It's morning, sunlight shines through the window pane, aw baby
You're beautiful as the sun shines across your sleeping face, ohhhh baby
What a lovely night we had, yeah
As we shared each other's love
But we forgot about all the pain we caused
As we slept the night away

Chorus:

As we lay, we forgot about tomorrow as we lay
As we lay, we forgot about tomorrow as we lay

Verse 3:

It's morning, and now it's time for us to say goodbye
Goodbye babe
You're leaving, and honey I must hurry home to face my wife
I don't ever want to hurt her
And she would never understand
That I belonged to you for just one night, as we slept the night away

Chorus

Verse 4:

I don't ever want to hurt her
And she would never under-stand
That I belonged to you for just one night, as we slept the night away

As we lay, we forgot about tomorrow as we lay
As we lay, and I know our love won't ever fade away
It's morning
It's morning
It's morning
