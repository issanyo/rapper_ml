Now wait a minute
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
They Poplock
WOOOO

Poplocking in Rolls-Royce, Cadillacs, Lincolns and Mercedes Benz
Poplocking in Howard Johnson, Sheraton
Poplocking at the Holiday Inn
Poplocking in Hollywood, it's understood
While listening to the Mac
Poplocking at Broadway, everyday
To the Preachers

So rough, so tough, out here baby
So rough, so tough, out here
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city, of L.A
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
They Poplock

Dance, dance disco style
It's all on the West Coast
Living good and playing hard
Cruising the Boulevard
Leaning and feeling
And you won't be dreaming
That's what it's all about

So rough, so tough, out here baby
So rough, so tough, out here baby
So rough, so tough, out here baby
So rough, so tough, out here baby
WOOOO
Lock it up baby
WOOOO, YA

Lock them shoulders
Lock them arms
Now lock that neck
Just raise those fingers in the air
I swear it's getting mighty funky out there
There's a party over here
There's a party over there
Can't get it right on cuz
Playboys
That's cool, clean and man
Can't get it right on cuz
Right on
So rough, so tough, out here baby
So rough, so tough, out here

California knows how to party
