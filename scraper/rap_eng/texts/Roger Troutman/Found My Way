You left me here alone
With his child
All hope was gone
I couldn't find my way alone

I met you then
But I doubted you
Still your strength
Enchanted me

You were a father to my child
And a man to me
Now I'm no longer lost
'Cause you showed me my way

I used to be so lost
In a world of untrue love
Then you came along and led me home
Well, at first I doubted you
And still you brought me through
And now I've found my way

You understand
All the pain that was caused by
Another man
You gave me love and not lust

Me and my child
We loved you so
But I want you to know
I'm awed by you

And the tender way you do
All the things you do
Now I'm no longer lost
You showed me my way

I used to be so lost
In a world of untrue love
Then you came along and led me home
Well, at first I doubted you
And still you brought me through
And now I've found my way

You showed me my way

I used to be so lost
In a world of untrue love
Then you came along and led me home
Well, at first I doubted you
And still you brought me through
And now I've found my way

I learned to love
You brought out the fire
Burning in my soul
Now I've found myself
'Cause you showed me
You showed me the way

I used to be so lost
In a world of untrue love
Then you came along
Led, led, led, led, led me home
Then you brought me through
Now I found my way

Then you came along and led me home
First I doubted you
Then you brought me through
And now I've found my way

Now I wanna thank the Lord
'Cause you came into my life
And now I've found my way
