[Verse: Hittman]

I got a gang of untold Cali sagas
Like mobbin' to Palisades to fade this nigga that bothered
My homegirl from Palms
Not to mention she used to fuck my cousin Daughn and had a fine ass Moms
Got in a scrap at Mardi Gras then came dipped to after prom
The most unwanted clique at any party in the Don's
Any gitt together at West Palms, we just Da Macz we just the bomb
And we back fuckin' up those who overreact
Off hash, the blunts, and cognac, shitted on the throne of rap
Get it through your dome the fact
You gotta bow down again
Or witness the fact of being fouled by my team every now and then, you didn't know?
Read the book on how you could win
Never mind that`s a waste
My defeat will never take place
I put that on Stress and Shaloe Mac that got physically erased
And if you could see me your hair'd turn white like Robert Blakes
I'm that shit in that pipe that you base from
Today`s special's knuckle sandwiches
And i'mma fuck around and let you taste one for free
(you can't stop it baby)
Nah, like Batterram by Toddy Tee
You're a captive of 83
I'm on some 2010 Space Odyssey
ACG not Wallabee golly gee
We be on that nextness, follow me
I lick buckshots you gitt left back like my exes
Shotgun in a Lexus is cool but yo gott my own car
Now i'm a lone star like the state of Texas
Have video extras for breakfast
Then kick them to the curb
For havin` the nerve fo comin` at me like they`re precious
Bitch you`re no woman you fuck niggas to gitt on guest list
Skimpy dress expresses you wanted your shit exploited, she got done man
I ran through her like Warrick
Hittmanifestos` make your best shit sound prehistoric
Rhyme torrid keep microphones burning like Caloric ovens
If I ever met my match time for gudgin`
Keep in mind I hold position like Rosa on the bus
Nigga trust I ain`t budgin` , my niggas be dumpin`
Others say they`re bad but they buggin`
Now these hoes I ain`t lovin` u
And fucks I ain`t givin`
My foes they ain`t livin`
Competition be like ducks sittin`
Try to be fly and gitt struck down like a clay pigeon
Cuz what they say contradicts like a gay christian
I stay itchin` to bust opposers
Pissin` on their exposure, dissin` me cuz i`m hittin` like dojah
What i`m spittin` will really ensure your decomposure
El nino in the prime of summer your reign is over
Another rest in peace composer, for real

[Hook]
