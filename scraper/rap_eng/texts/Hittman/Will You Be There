I call your name but you're not quite there
You feel the same, who said life was fair
Turn the words around, shattered heart burns inside you

Locked in my dreams it's all I've learned
And from what I've seen it's got to be real
That's when my feelings start to spill

I gave my love, I tried before
To fight those tears, I can't wait anymore

Will you be there, will you be there
It started again, all the love and the time I've spent
It's over and then, you come on strong
Until I give in

It hurts sometimes, I cried before
To fight those tears, I won't wait anymore

Will you be there, oh, to share, my love...
It hurts sometimes, I cried before
To fight those tears, I can't wait anymore

Will you be there, will you be there, will you be there
To share my love
