Once long ago, I held onto a pride
Something inside me died, cast my memories aside, long ago
Far beyond the dome, where time's wind always blows
Your people chose to run, to breed beneath the sun
They're home

Deep inside the glass I peer out through your eyes
For you I'd compromise, live my life in disguise
Anything

[Chorus]
We live behind the lines where no one knows
We live behind the lines

Far out from this place, my father he awaits
Not for my life he prays but yet my bravery he raves

[Chorus]
