It's all said and done on the other side
The rain is scarce, the sun is black, and my throat is dry it all moves so very fast, almost like each moment is my last
Unseen by the young and old, running on.. a renegade man
Catch my breath, a delirious rage, exiled man from a worn out page
Did my time in life so long ago
I don't know whether it's heaven or hell, betting my life on the wishing well
I have an angel on my side
Doing my time the best I can, knowing I'm a renegade...
Whoa-oh, I'm a renegade man, go where the wind blows
Whoa-oh, a renegade man, destination unknown
Every time there's a blue sky high, get the same old feeling inside
Life ahead gonna' make me reach the mile
But that was oh so long ago
Traded in my dreams I've been bought and sold
But I have an ace still in my hand
Doing my time the best I can, knowing I'm a renegade..
Whoa-oh, I'm a renegade man, go where the wind blows
Whoa-oh, I'm a renegade man, destination unknown
Whoa-oh, I'm a renegade man, go where the wind blows
Whoa-oh, a renegade man, destination unknown
Spent my life, my dreams, my money
Wars I've lost and won are many
Looking for a fast getaway, gonna' take it, oh..
Whoa-oh, I'm a renegade man, go where the wind blows
Whoa-oh, a renegade man, destination unknown
Doing my time the best I can, knowing I'm a renegade..
Whoa-oh, I'm a renegade man, go where the wind blows
Whoa-oh, a renegade man, destination.. destination unknown
A renegade.. renegade.. man
