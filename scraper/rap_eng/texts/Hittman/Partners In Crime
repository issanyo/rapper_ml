One heart, one soul, one mind, two of a kind, partners in crime
We work together like lock and key
We've got each other, that's all we ever need
Don't need no system, we got no guarantees
No flash, no cash, no TV trash
What we got we got for free
I know, you know, that we were meant to be
And I know, you know, so come and get it
One heart, one soul, one mind, two of a kind, partners in crime
Whoever said that love was blind, two of a kind, partners in crime
People are talking, don't care what they say
We got a good thing, let's get it underway
My reputation, got nothing' on me now, cause you and me were meant to be, we're gonna' see it through somehow
I know, you know, that we were meant to be
And I know, you know, so come and get it
One heart, one soul, one mind, two of a kind, partners in crime
Whoever said that love was blind, two of a kind, partners in crime
Stop!...
Every time I find a new relation, I get so scared and try to run, to be free again
Lord knows you want to be free
Oooh, you're giving me a cool sensation, wanna' be the blood that makes your heart beat in time with mine
You and me we're partners in crime
Now I said let's go
H-e-e-e-e-e-r's Johnny
Partners in crime
One heart, one soul, one mind, two of a kind, partners in crime
Whoever said that love was blind, two of a kind, partners in..
Crime!
