There was a time when an empty page and an empty plate were one
And there was a time, I thought 'bout giving in
But I swore unto my dying day, you know I could never hide
The feelings deep inside, I want it all..
I want it all
It seems like my life gets worn away by wind and rain and storm
Seems like my life, it don't mean much on its own
It needs love and care and guidance just to break out from the pack
There can be no looking back if you want it all..
And I want it
Words are there to hide what you're really feeling
Words make worlds collide, don't believe them
Words are only words, are only words.. only words
And that's all
I lived a life of sin never gave a care for what I did
I use to think that trust was a payment and a must, I know about giving in
So let me fly like a bird up in the sky
Let me fly, for a while, I try to speak, wind blows me my words away
And I said that words are there to hide what you're really feeling, don't believe me
Words are there to hide what you're really feeling
Words make worlds collide
Words make worlds collide
Words are.. only words are.. only words
