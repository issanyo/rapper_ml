I got a backbone, you want to feel it
Starts up here and runs way down
I got a hand full of lies, don't make me say them
Don't move any closer, just a little closer
We've got our own defenses, watch those skeletons climb those fences
I'm so bad..
I'm so bad
I can't help but run from my love, just when it has begun
I got a disposition can you sense it
Ha..
I got an attitude a mile long
At times a little stiff so I can kill it, and if I don't turn back, the dead don't walk
These four walls I've built around me got a mind of their own and they.. talk to me
I'm so bad..
I'm so bad
I can't help but run from my love, just when it has begun
I'm so bad..
I'm so bad
I can't help but run from my love, just when it has..
I'm so bad...
