[Hook]
If you like getting high
Smoke out baby
And to the ladies that's fine
I'd love to love you baby
But see I'm trying to get mynz
So don't yall hate me
And it's about that time to do my thing

[Verse 1]
Well it's funky, funky, funky cause you heard it from Hitt first
Doctor's operating while I'm spittin' a sick verse
Strictly for banging when you're ridin' around
But if you see the (Siren) you got to mute your sounds
Cause you don't want your whip to end up in the impound
But that's what would happen if the strap was found
They crackin' down, but I be crackin' up
Outsmarting them like Buggs in a ACME truck
Now who's the looniest toon black as Daffy Duck
That like them nasty ass sluts like Janet Jacme, what
This Swiss Miss named Hershey Kiss gave me  acne bumps
Now I wear a Sex Packet when I Humpty Hump
It's like that yall (that yall)
We just Macz yall (Macz Yall)
And if you can't act right well don't act at all
And if your hair is gittin' thin then rock it bald
Hand on my cock like Herbie I'm a rock it yall
They raided Tower records (for) sellin' dope so pure
They raid The Wherehouse becuz my dope's so pure
Hey Dre keeps supplying me there ain't no cure
A lot of tryers in the game but not a lot of doers
I'm Guinness Stout with this style you're watered down like Coors
When I rock this on Apollo (just watch) don't boo us
Cause if you do we're stompin' Sandman for tryna remove us
I'll boo boo on you fakers fool with the movers & shakers
In L.A. I be ballin' like the Lakers
Vacating in Vegas, Madalay Bay stayin' faded
Want a hit? Here's the muthafuckin' latest

[Hook]

[Bridge] x2
I be the dopest nigga that never slung caine
Live in the hood but I don't gangbang
The rawest man since 87 Kane
Now watch me do my thang

[Verse 2]
Even witcha eyes closed
Everybody knows nobody flows like I flows
That's how I gitt the girls with the nice toes
Plus they say "You know, you look just like Cole" (who?)
That's when I hit' them with the night pole
The nightstick, Las Palmas get a white chick
Good Bar gitt a black chick
El Carmen gitt an overnight chick
Low key chicks they be at Jo-seph's
You gotta be low key to even know this
Is my year to be a brag and boaster
Sippin' Cognac signin' children's posters
Girls actin' right then sit on the sofa
Fools talkin' smack the gat is in the holster
Oh you wanna smoke muthafucka? Hold up
Here's some Zig-Zags, motherfucker roll up

[Hook]
