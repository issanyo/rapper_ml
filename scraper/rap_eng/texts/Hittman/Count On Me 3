[Verse 1]
Rocks in my jock but a nigga underage so the cops couldn't do shit about it
And niggas tryna plot but I got a master P with some no limit shots, bout it bout it
My phone keep ring and my phone keep ring, and im like yeah yeah whatchu need?
Can't say it on the phone gotta use code words cos I can't get booked on re
Trap house post office, i got it packed up, sacked up, soon all ready to be shipped
So just keep ya nose snotty, got that tissue on the way but til then man just sniff
Man first yall got questions all for them yappers in that case im yo study guide
Dont answer no questions for no coppers cos lucki sure know how to hide
And why you shoppin around with them niggas like you dont know where im at or sumn
You know im posted up on that corner like i been waitin for a ride or sumn
I got this drug shit on lock, so pay me and get a combination
They hope this drug shit won't stop, so pay me or its that constipation

[Hook]
Spread the whole word got the town on me
Thirty pills keep them down me
She heard i got it, and they heard i got it
Now they all know i got it they can count on me

If you need them packs my nigga you can count on me
If you need that thrax my nigga you can count on me
If you need that, if you need that, if you need that

[Verse 2]
That one damn bitch had a fuckin relapse, OD'd god damn that's a shame
She called my phone talkin bout she want the good luck and I wished her the same
At least mofuckers know I'm cookin up the good dope, like Lil B with the flame
She thought this kinda dope would help her stand up, this ain't that type of cane
And Lucki had to get around things like that
Fourth quarter kicks shit, range like that
Any new dealer taking rate off my crack
Gettin fined on the block and he pay me right back
Name another nigga dealin out drug cards
Colours on deck boy i match em like uno
Too smart, too quick to be lookin at bars
Got clucks on the windows, mouth on me like Cujo
Mouth on me like Cujo...

[Hook]
Spread the whole word got the town on me
Thirty [?] keep they damn [?] on me
She heard i got it, and they heard i got it
Now they all know i got it they can count on me
Third last time you can count on me
If you need that sack my nigga you can count on me
If you need that thrax my nigga you can count on me
If you need that, if you need that, if you need that
