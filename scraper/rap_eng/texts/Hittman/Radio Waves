Well as a young man I can recall, hearing Reagan talk the possibilities of a war
Staring at the TV trying to make believe
My father understands , my mother pours the tea
It's all we do cause all that we see, television brain washing the lives that we lead
It's like we do more than we think
We've got to change the channel cause the wave's on the brink
It's all the same, it'll never change
See its got me to wonder
It's all the same but the name have changed
Better clear the black
I'm 21 now and working the job
May after taxes take home make me feel like I've been robbed
Reach for the channel for a chance to escape
Iraq invades Kuwait, another series of gang rapes
It's all the same, it'll never change, and it's got me to wonder
Who's on the take, and who's getting paid
Gonna' dig my grave I hear it echo through my mind..
R A D I O
It's like the memory of a time gone by
Like my radio..
R A D I O
And I hear it echo through my mind..
R A D I O
Seems like the memory of a time gone by
Like my radio
