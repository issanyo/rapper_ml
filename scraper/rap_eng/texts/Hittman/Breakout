Locked up inside behind iron doors
Solitary in stone
Taken by force, a prisoner of war
Time lets us know we're alone

Time, wearing my life down
Inside the walls surrounded
Destined to be damned, by the iron hand

[Chorus:]
Breakout, breakout
Breakout, breakout

Held in a state of motionless time
Determined to find my way out
Fighting to live I'm fearing to die
The choices are clear but I can't decide

These chains holding my life down
No longer keep me bound
Destined to be damned by the iron hand

[Chorus]
Gone is the pain
But still in my mind are the memories
And scars that remain
For once I had lived as a slave, a prisoner enchained
But at last I have found my way out, it's so good to be free!

[Chorus]
