There’s a man who lives a life of danger
To everyone he meets, he stays a stranger
With every move he makes, another chance he takes
Odds are you won’t live to see tomorrow
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They’re giving you a number and they’re taking away your name
Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can have an evil mind
Be careful what you say, you’ll give yourself away
Odds are you won’t live to see tomorrow
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They’re giving you a number and they’re taking away your name
