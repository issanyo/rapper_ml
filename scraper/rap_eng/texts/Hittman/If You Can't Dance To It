Hey Mr
Star Maker
I got a new song, you 'gotta kick it out the jam
Got the hook and the groove, man it's really the move
It's really different man
Just part your hair to the side, wear it over your eye and your groovy
Kinda' sounds like the stones, but don't call it a clone
The band wagon's leaving baby, better jump on
But if you can't dance to it, what'cha you 'gonna do
You can't dance to it
But if you can't dance to it, what'cha you 'gonna do
You can't dance to it
Not 'gonna dance with you
Hey Mr
Rock & Roll
I'm fresh out of school
I'm 'gonna make you a star
Got a pair of tin ears, and a shit attitude
Guess I was born into A & R
Can you savor the flavor
Are you part of the club
Are you groovy? Got the grunge and the doom
Ain't got much of a tune
They come from Seattle, better sign them up soon
But if you can't dance to it, what'cha you 'gonna do
You can't dance to it
But if you can't dance to it, what'cha you 'gonna do
You can't dance to it
Not 'gonna dance with you
You.. you were a fading star
You'd never get this far on your own
You, you're living daddy's dream
Spending Ahmet's green, talking on your cellular phone
But if you can't dance to it, what'cha you 'gonna do
You can't dance to it
But if you can't dance to it, what'cha you 'gonna do
You can't dance to it
Dance to it!
