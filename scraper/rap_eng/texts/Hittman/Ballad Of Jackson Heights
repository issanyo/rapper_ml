All those memories long ago
How did I get through it all
Yesterday I thought I had your love
Met you on an April night
With one kiss I knew it was right
On that day I thought I had your love
Said I never knew how long a love could take
And I never knew how fast my heart would break
Still all I need is to wrap my arms around you
But it's too late, I'm too young for love
I could go on thinking about my time with you
Said, I could go on thinking 'bout the crazy things that we do
Like meeting on that rainy night
The "7" train, yeah, to Jackson
Heights
On that day I thought I had your love
It's too late, I'm too young
Then why do I feel this love so strong
It's too late and too young for your love
It's too late, I'm too young
But deep in my heart
I know you feel love
It's too late and all that you say is that I'm too young
Don't you really think it's time
I don't know, never did
Did you really change your mind
You loved me, i know you did
And now is the time we should be together
But it's too late
I'm too young for your love
But it's too late, I'm too young
Then why do I feel this love so strong
It's too late and all that you say is that I'm too young
It's too late, I'm too young
But deep in my heart I know you feel love
It's too late and I'm too young for.. love
