[Intro]
I'm in here like (?) in here
My little shorty fucked your bitch cause he be with me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, ay-ay-ay

[Verse]
Come and find me, come and get me
My little shorty fucked your bitch cause he be with me
Hit 1000 on that pic just cause she with me
I don't rob no more but man your homies tempt me
Don't ask me why I'm so high bitch you say you get me
Lil bro say how you move so fast on them percocets
Lil nigga when this shit a passion ain't no side effects
Took off this field trip on this school bus, don't call me back
Them hoes just tell me I'm a demon and I run with that
And what's a goblin to the devil, unless she fine with that
That bitch gotta mute me when I drop so she can't take me
Better call your big bro or sum, lil nigga you can't take me
I need some acne it ain't nothin' for me at Macy's
Bitch I'm no poser, supreme shooter do no skating
Ay, dudes are scary, he won't meet me, say I'm shady
That scared money still count up if you take it
Jah Money die for me, rollin' side of me
Esco take 'em out for me let him out please
You wanna get as high as me? Okay that's fine with me
Hey bitch I'm Xander, no surprises, please don't lie to me

[Outro]
Woah-woah, come and get me
My little shorty fucked your bitch cause he be with me
Woah-woah, come and get me
Woah-woah, woah-woah
