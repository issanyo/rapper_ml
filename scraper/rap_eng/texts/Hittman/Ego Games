[Intro: Jet 2]
Living with these mood switches
Gotta deal with them
Material gets the best of us all
And in the midst of all of that
I search for where the light is at
Light is at, light is at, light is at

[Verse 1: Jet 2]
Okay the story starts somewhere in the past
Boy meets girl, fell in love with that
Boy meets rap, fell in love with that
And kept on rapping 'til he turned his stats into a couple stacks
I got that passion, what you want?
They got me playing games with my ego
I'm trying to figure out what I really want
I really do this, but I don't
Really think I'm trying to wait for time to tell me that I'm wrong
Clock is ticking, tick-tick-tick
Mind full of memories, thinking back to my sentiments
Days with Spiyda chilling before summer school, the block sizzling
And listening to Wayne wishing it would rain
So I can fly inside the sky and drown inside my name
I'm feeling like

[Hook: Hitman & Jet 2]
Oh what, you thinking you the man now?
(Then what you call that)
Niggas in high demand now?
(Then what you call that)
Killing 'em off, hands down
(I really wish y'all fall back
You got me playing these ego games with the flesh
No where near the best) (repeat 2x)

[Verse 2: Jet 2]
I'm willing to work like it, F a psychic
If it's Batman, I'll be Robin
I'm a flying bird, the bird's the word
I heard it before while practicing curving the flow
I love to love to love to give in to these urges
Ain't a person, I'm a spirit's
What I learned but while I'm living
I attempt to ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tap in infinite
Intelligence like Edison invented this
Microphone that I'm rapping on
Oh no, excuse me that was telephones but who cares
As long as my crew's here
And all of the cameras watching, know I gotta chew ya
Eat right through ya and then talk about it
Walk 'round your expression like I'm better
Get you out of my lane
That's what happens, we're playing ego games
I'm saying

[Hook: Hitman & Jet 2]

[Verse 3: Jet 2]
(beat boxing)
I'm everything I say I am, or I ain't
You only perceive me by pictures I paint
Everything I do has stemmed from what I think
You get pens and draw your blanks
I'm a square, but I can plank
Planking on a million, soak it in like a SpongeBob
Roll around with Christ and still praying to the Son's God
In a bucket of water and soak before I unwind
Lost for the bangers too, I never ever won time

[Hook: Hitman & Jet 2]

[Verse 4: Jet 2]
What's the meaning of all this?
I'm saying that spiritual growth is gorgeous
I'm saying that I'm still battling with my ego
So that's what the fuck I'mma call this
That's what, what I'mma call this
I be floating in the orbit
Put my solace on a target
Since my soul just ain't for sale
I think my soldiers gotta ride
If Juliette ain't around, do that mean Romeo gotta die?
Why, sharpest with the penmanship, my simple writing shakes peers
Type of stuff that takes years I make here and break fear
Consult with stress, yeah those are two of my buddies
They let me know that they love me when life is getting real ugly
The ego games

[Hook: Hitman & Jet 2]
