Here's the problem with the whole situation
Stereotypical rock-n-roll population
Nobody listening to the music for its passion
They're tuned to videos watching all the fads and fashions
I you miss that special feeling just look in my eyes
If you need to free from visual and to satisfy
Listen to.. to this
I used to think I had the music scene all scooped out
Hangin' at the scrap bar with my blackened hair all grown out
Everyone bidding for the million dollar contract
Billion dollar babies signing up with their new f*ck act
If you miss that special feeling, got to leave them behind
If you want that brand new edge that's gonna' blow your mind
Listen to this
Can you hear what I'm feeling
Listen to.. to this
Listen to the words you're hearing
Does it evoke a long lost feeling
Listen to your heart and don't you know.. you're listening
Listen to this
Can you hear what I'm feeling
Listen to.. to this
Listen to this
Listen to the words you're hearing
Does it evoke a long lost feeling
Listen to your heart and don't you know.. you're listening
