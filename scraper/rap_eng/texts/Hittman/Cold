(Hook)
I swear my heart so cold. My niggas wit me they know
We don't trust no soul, I swear my heart all froze
Always trained to go, Henny in my zone
I got a bad bitch and she bold, I got her mind dumb blown
But I'm, so cold so cold I'm cold
These diamonds on me cold
These niggas wit me cold
I swear my heart so cold

(Verse 1: Hit-Man)
I swear I'm cold, I swear I'm cold
No fear, Straight animal
A little paranoid, I can't help it
This Glock is unbearable
And I'm so high, I'm soarin
These bullets rain, they pourin
These women all adore us, And all my pistols foreign
Please don't play both sides, That will get yo ass caught up
And don't you ever tell no lie, Cause that's the reason why we don't trust
For my family I go crazy, Cause that's my real love
My squad with whatever. Disrespect We tear them up
And its two G's all on my belt, Louis 13 cause its the best
And we don't love none of these bitches, Cause its not good for your health
I think I lost my mind, Smokin all this dope
Ready oh am I, I keep my ninas close
We so savage, God my witness
I swear I'm so cold
I swear I'm cold, I swear I'm cold
God my witness, I swear so I'm cold
I swear I'm cold, I swear I'm cold

(Hook)
I swear my heart so cold. My niggas wit me they know
We don't trust no soul, I swear my heart all froze
Always trained to go, Henny in my zone
I got a bad bitch and she bold, I got her mind dumb blown
But I'm, so cold so cold I'm cold
These diamonds on me cold
These niggas wit me cold
I swear my heart so cold

(Verse 2: Swagg)
And the chain on my neck so froze
That's probably why my heart cold
All my guys keep big poles
Think its a lie, you can ask Rico
I make these haters sick
Cause they crushes be on my dick
The Opps made niggas clique
So I called my nigga Hit
Need that top, I don't need no tease
And I check that bag, With Ease
My niggas smoke dope, Sip lean
I's up for them G's
No lackin, I love my team
B.I.P to broski JOJO, And to JayLoud rest in peace
It's one time for them groupies, Two times for my niggas
Hallow tips in them 30's, We will smoke you like a swisher
I hope you get the picture, And always take one with ya
But till then, Bricksquad D-Block
Just know, We toting pistols
Its two beams, Stuffed in my belt
When I smile, Make these hoes wet
Bet these bands, Will make her flex
So I do this shit, For a check
Swear that we trust no soul
Jus benjamins no hoes
And everybody blows
Fuck the opps
They gotta go

(Hook)
I swear my heart so cold. My niggas wit me they know
We don't trust no soul, I swear my heart all froze
Always trained to go, Henny in my zone
I got a bad bitch and she bold, I got her mind dumb blown
But I'm, so cold so cold I'm cold
These diamonds on me cold
These niggas wit me cold
I swear my heart so cold

And the whole time, niggas thought she was a keeper
Shit, that ho the reason I'm a freezer
