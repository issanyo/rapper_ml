Mother, say a prayer for me
A message of hope to the faith you believe in
Father.. and the powers that be
I know I might have let you down
Every time I look into your eyes, I see the pain and anger
Every time you hear the words I say, it seems they never matter
I'd always hoped you'd find a way to cure yourself and reason
But I can't stay and waste forever
I hope you understand
Mother, say a prayer for me
A message of hope to the faith you believe in
Father.. and the powers that be
I know I might have let you down
Say a prayer for me
Every time I need to channel the anger, I spit words instead of knives
All of the time you tried to persecute me, I'd hold my breath and tell you
Lies of fortune, lies of fame
What matter, lies are all the same
It's time I've got to pave my own way out from a shattered man
Mother, say a prayer for me
A message of hope to the faith you believe in
Father.. and the powers that be
I know I might have let you down
Say a prayer for me
Miracle of miracles, save me I've fallen down
Miracle of miracles, save me I'm calling you
Can't sleep..
I can't think..
I can't move, my heart is weak
I can't live..
I can't love...I draw strength from up above
Oh..
Mother.. say a prayer for me
A message of hope to the faith you believe in
Father.. and the powers that be
I know I might have let you down
Mother.. say a prayer for me
A message of hope to the faith you believe in
Father.. and the powers that be
I know I might have let you down
