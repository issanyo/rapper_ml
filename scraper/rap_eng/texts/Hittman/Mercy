Cold is the blood in need of warning
Where will it lead me tonight
A brief affair, the need for power
A vicious urge to satisfy
No time to stop stare
No time to warn, beware
No time for love, just fear and silence
No time to scream, just pray
You'll leave alive, obey
And I will grant you this small flavor.. life
Every time and every place, I walk the streets for.. my love
Gleaming cat's eyes, poised to strike now
In just seconds thy will be done
Every time I search your face, I start to see my own horizons
Thoughts that fill my mind are void
I you be kind, I will be kinder
Stay with me, pray with me, oh, as the subject starts recover
Stay with me, pray with me tonight.. mercy
Seconds have past that feel like hours
When will you leave or will you die
Reject the love I give or devour
Inflicted pain will be just enough
No time to see my face
A form so filled with pain
No time to capture thoughts, just silence
No time to scream, just pray
You'll leave alive, obey
And I will grant you this small flavor
Stay with me, pray with me, oh, as the subject starts recover
Stay with me I'm free, tell me.. you're beautiful
I hold your lifeline in my hands
Shhhh..
Don't talk..
Let my love embrace you
Shhhh..
Don't move
Let my love surround you
Please..
Love me..
Let my love embrace you
Please.. show me you love me
I love you
I've tried so many times, yet failed at love
I guess I'm meant to be alone
I can't complain
I've still my memories and now you're saying that it's over
That's not the way I want it
That's not the way it should be..
No
I want to love you forever
Do you love me
Tell me why
