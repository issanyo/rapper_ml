[Chorus: Yo-Yo]
Givin’ it up…givin’ it up

[Verse 1: Yo-Yo]
It’s one of those days, up early in the morning
Got a call from my homie saying she’s got a hangover
All night drinking, that ‘gnac’s got us woozy
Stomach still bubbling up like a Jacuzzi
Wish we had some plans, coulda planned for the beach
Niggas that I know is gon’ be flossin’ in their hoopties
Just like every crew you see hitting Crenshaw Street
Gon’ have their ass at Venice Beach this week
So we get dressed about 2, call up the rest of the crew
Plus backup, ‘cause once they drink, you know how niggas act up

[Chorus: Yo-Yo]
Givin’ it up…givin’ it up

[Verse 2: Yo-Yo]
Sliding in, side to side, front and back and on racks
Just like I thought, this muthafucka’s packin’
Looking like a car show, shit just shining
Just a player hater but I’ll damn sure date him
Sounds coming out the woodwork, it’s babes everywhere
Just lampin’ and chronic cramp nobody style
Got the pimp Rolexes beaming like Scotty, child
These niggas is wild at this beach party
I got my posse in effect, just scoping
Saying it’s a shame, meet more women with game
But my posse’s deep and we’re all sucka free
As we walk the beach in our two-piece

[Chorus: Yo-Yo]
Givin’ it up…givin’ it up

[Verse 3: Lil E]
Smoking on that indo for your info
Makes me get psycho, ten times badder than Michael
Burying slugs in your mug
I tug on the trigger once more to make sure you’re lying in the mud
Breaking fools down to their knees as they beg “please”
From the duo, yo, the two O.G.’s
My style is not sloppy, so copy
Even though it’s impossible to drop me, so jock me
Before I had a ride, I used to kick out on Figuero’
The khakis low, it wasn’t slow for me to really bump a hoe
‘6-4’s rolling, hitting switches for my bitches, yo
Couldn’t understand, had to get paid with the quickness, so
I came up with a way to get paid, short as Minute Maid
Laid in the cut for some days—UH!
Yo-Yo said that the shit must be funky
Come real, tear the shit up is what she told me
My style is crazy phat, got a gat for who’s all that
For the simple fact, I pack what they ass lack

[Chorus: Yo-Yo]
Givin’ it up…givin’ it up

[Outro: Prince Ital Joe]
Give it up for Yo-Yo ‘cause you’re big and ready
Top notch rapper of the Lench Mob posse
A batty bwoy test and we bust with my gat
Invade your life, invade your privacy
Now, marked for dead, they all are marked for dead
Marked for dead, me say you’re marked for dead
If you fuck with Yo-Yo, yes, you’re marked for dead
Gunshot in on your face, don’t you lose respect

[Chorus: Yo-Yo]
Givin’ it up…givin’ it up
