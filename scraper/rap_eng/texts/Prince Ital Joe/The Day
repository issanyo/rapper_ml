[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
Hail Mary, full of grace
I got the devil in my head again
My eyes blood shot red again
I thought I escaped this trap
But I'm back smokin' on a surface purple plat
Satan whispers, got me back on my dark liquor
That fire water killin' my liver
The snake hisses in my ear, it's a natural born killer, yeah
Kill 'em all before they kill ya dead
Is my mind playin' tricks on me?
Is that man in that trench coat after me?
I wake up with my sheet soaked, half asleep
Hearin' 2Pac's voice screamin' "blasphemy"
Sayin' "Come with me, (Hail Mary), see, run quick see"
Then I hear the voice of B.I.G
"Dyin' ain't the shit but It's pleasant, kinda quiet"
But I don't buy It

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
Day of Judgement, God Is calling
Underneath the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan laughing, spreads his wings
Oh Lord, yeah

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Trapped in a dunya, straying from the path of sooner
Poor tenders often absent from Juma
Five prayers undeclared, but I barely get to it
Fornicating with these kafirs, my life is in ruins
It's hard to fight back tears
When I'm in tune with my music
Banned from the stairs from the occupation I'm choosin'
I'm a Muslim by nature, gangster by circumstance
Sonny says the workin' man don't stand a chance
And I'm a man and I ain't perfect
But that's a poor excuse, it ain't workin'
A man once complained he ain't have no shoes
So he once met a man who ain't have no feet
They say prayer is better than sleep
The earth shall belong to the meek
I try to be a mindful of speech
Knowing everything's written and the clock's still ticking
Therefore I just pray that I'm prepared for... the day

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
Day of Judgement, God Is calling
Underneath the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan laughing, spreads his wings
Oh Lord, yeah

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Our Father, please show me the light
My life ain't right, the devil got my head in a vice
I can't escape 'em, he keep chasin'
In the name of the most patient, I rebuke thee Satan
Causin' trials and tribulations, tryin' to test my faith
Bringing strife into my life with your whirling temptations
Let's say a prayer for the souls that's lost in the matrix
Whoever eat of the fruit forever dwell in the lake
As I walk through the valley, I shall show no fear
Forever dwell in the house as the hour draws near
And as you call a lost home, I shall shed no tear
But rejoice in your words 'cause your truth is clear
They buildin' up then they tearin' down
Revelations in effect here and now
I was terrified of death but I don't fear It now
I was blind, dumb, and deaf, but I hear it now
Do you hear me now? Good

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
Day of Judgement, God Is calling
Underneath the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan laughing, spreads his wings
Oh Lord, yeah
