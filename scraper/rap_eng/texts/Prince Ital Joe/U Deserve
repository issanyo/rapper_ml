[Intro: Monica]
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Listen to me

[Hook: Monica]
You deserve all the heartache and the pain (Yes, you do)
Don’t come crying talking ‘bout he’s playing games
(No, no, no)
You should know life is what you make of it (no, no)
Regardless who he is
If you put up with it
You deserve it

[Verse 1: Monica]
Why you wanna be with him
‘Cause all you ever do is cry
He’ll tell you that you ain’t enough
He’s tearing you apart inside
And when you need a ear
I listen to everything you have to say
I tell you every day to leave
But it seems you’d rather stay

[Bridge: Monica]
And girl
A man could only do what you let him
And girl
It don’t do you no good to just sweat him
And girl
You can’t just let him abuse you
I’ll tell you what you should do
But if you choose not to, you deserve

[Hook: Monica]
You deserve all the heartache and the pain
(so will you hurt, no)
Don’t come crying talking ‘bout he’s playing games
(baby you should know)
You should know life is what you make of it (Life is what you make of it)
Regardless who he is (Regardless who he is)
If you put up with it
You deserve it

[Verse 2: Monica]
Now that you’ve a guy who’ll kiss
But you use him as your strength
To get out of a bad situation
To get out this relationship
I promise you he’ll never change
I know you really want him to
So all the things he promises
I hope you don’t expect him to

[Bridge: Monica]
And girl
A man could only do what you let him
And girl

And girl
You can’t just let this man abuse you
I’ll tell you what you should do
But if you choose not to, then you deserve

[Hook: Monica]

Regardless who he is (Regardless who he is)
If you put up with it (If you put up with it)
Then you deserve it

[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]
Peep the whole scene and whatever’s going on around me
Burned out, clutching my pillow, stuck in the county
You hate when I step off with honeys and [?]
Who saying I want a baby chase, you can’t relate
Pump your brakes, mami please ‘cause you buggin’ me out
And treat me worse than them streets, it’s like you thuggin' me out
But I could look into your eyes and see you aching inside
You hope I
Die-die-die-die-die-die-die-die-die-die
You deserve
(And so you deserve)

[Hook: Monica]
You deserve all the heartache and the pain
(heartache and the pain)
Don’t come crying talking ‘bout he’s playing games
You should know life is what you make of it (Life is what you make of it)
Regardless who he is
If you put up with it
Then you deserve it

Listen to me
Realize that I can make you see
[?]
Do you wanna live a lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
(So listen)

[Hook: Monica]
You deserve all the heartache and the pain
Don’t come crying talking ‘bout he’s playing games
And you should know life is what you make of it
Regardless who he is
If you put up with it
Then you deserve it
