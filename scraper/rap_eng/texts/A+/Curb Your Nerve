Uh-uh
Yea-yea, yea-yea, yea-yea
What what whaaat
Uh-uh, Hieroglyphics
It's A-Plus, know what I'm saying
Eastside Oakland
Check it out though
Yo, check

[A-Plus]
I walk a balance amongst mildness and malness
Travel extremes between childness and cowardness
Walking on a thin line, still finna get mine
Any nigga problem with that, is all in this mind
And I ain't waiting for the time wasting
When you're franic mind brazing I be wine tasting
In a fine place in the Caribbean or Hawaii
With a dime saying it's so good to chill with you papi
I'm grolly, a lil' bit diffirent than you imagine
Wilder chickens giving lil' dudes the action
They asking, niggas don't be having no passion
But with me their girls sitting mo laughy in Aspen
It's hard to smoke there, no air
But I don't care and I'm still getting blown player
And when a nigga finish chief in this ganja
I'mma go and get a suit with Trecy and Randa
That's the life that I lead
Don't be smoking on my doja baby, that's my weed
Swear to god, sticky Cali make my black eyes pead
Only one thing can make me slow down, that's my seed
When I'm present all the bullshit ceases
If you don't really know me nigga don't call my Plea
It's, A-Plus, shake ducks, make bucks
And after A bust I cut they ate dust

Fuck the drama that you heard, you heard
Word for word I'mma serve your nerve (first we)
Flood your city then burn your burbs (that's right)
You outta turn homie, curb your nerve (Hiero)
A-Plus with superber verbs
Word for word I'mma serve your nerve
I got that heat to lead to dirt your burbs
You outta turn homie, curb your nerve

[A-Plus]
Word for word I'mma serve you nerds
Introduce your girl to my worm with sperms
I'm kinda nasty, but moms may be classy
Any disrespect to my home, I got my ass beat
My parents Jamaican, they call me a rude boy
I ain't had my own I used to play with my crew's toy
I got older, sold a, little doja
Now I'm a soldier slash record company owner for ya
You can ask Ty Stick if I'm sick
The type of shit I spit will make a dice switch right quick
I really like getting them benjamins
All that hype shit, you can get at your friends and them
I don't be talking about things I shouldn't speak on
I don't be hanging in places where I don't belong
When I'm posted getting my weed on, leave me 'lone
When I'm protecting my life, can nothing be wrong
I be buying niggas LP's, what can you tell me
Dude, I spend twenty b's, this is what you sell me
One tight song, any rhyme wrong
Stripper baby stole the cd case to do lines on

[A-Plus - Hook]
Fuck the drama that you heard, you heard
Word for word I'mma serve your nerve (first we)
Flood your city then burn your burbs (uh huh)
You outta turn homie, curb your nerve (Hiero)
Lil' Plea with superber verbs (that's right)
Word for word I'mma serve your nerve
I snatch your lady if a nigga get the urge to merge (c'mon)
You outta turn homie, curb your nerve

[A-Plus]
Yeah yeah, uh
Hieroglyphics baby
A-Plus
Souls of Mischief
Full Circle
This how we gone do it
First we come to the innercity
We flood that shit
We gone head out to the suburbs and burn it down
Understand me
