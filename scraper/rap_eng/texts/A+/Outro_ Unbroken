[uncredited female poet]
My last good deed, all that I needed and more
Said, done and undone
Who knows what the universe has in store
It's in control, I on a roll that doesn't slump or post
But travels at lightspeeds without a break
How much can I take? Not more than I can bear
I tear at my surroundings to find stability
The friction wearing on my soul
Grasping for things that give, and finding only those that take
Nails breaking, breaking, heart aching
I fall through to an inner space of absolute acceptance
Of my helplessness and my time to plead
My last good deed
Loyalty and integrity in tact
Dealing only with factual reason, unsettled through seasons
Then summer comes, I'm done
An unsung hero, found Nemo and saved many who befriend me
Without retribution
What's the solution? Recharged by the sun
My last good deed, relinquishing energy I need
To replenish me, so I can do you, instead of my seeds
No mo'
Flo Jo rhymes on streets of gold
I said you go when I thought it, and won't look back
On track, these are the facts
And it's easy to please me, you don't have to tease me
I'm finding while minding my own beeswax like kings and queens do
So get to work niggas~!
Go figure the shit out, or get out
Stop ridin me, all this up down all around has me dizzy
Kizzy cain't take no mo', so go, just leave...
Thank you for your presence, your love is the essence
Of our good deeds naturally
But these deeds that feed these favor cravors funds
I'm really not the one, I'm done

(I'm done, I'm done, I'm donnnnnnnnnnnne...) {*4X*}

You'll understand some of it even if I spare the details."
