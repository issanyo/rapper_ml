{Verse 1: Emanuel X}

Lemme
Know now/

I just wanna see How
This shit gonna go down/

Pull up like a pamper
Get it dirty like a hamper
In the middle of the night time
When you in ya Night gown/

In ya night gown? Yup
Want it right now/

If you gettin loud then imma
Tell you pipe down/

I don’t need ya nosy neighbors
All up in our business knowing how the fuck a real nigga put the pipe down/

Cuz then shit gon be awkward when
I bring in ya groceries/

I Don’t hope to
See who they be/

Don’t want them to notice me/
But if so then I’ll keep it G/

They prolly wonder
Why You blastin jodeci?/

At three in the morning
Actin joe to see/

Like go
To sleep/

Where Should
Ya focus be/

Bangin brooms on they
Ceiling ferociously/

Get it poppin regardless
Girl that body so flawless/

Textin me photos sayin
Boy slide thru and get all dis/

I’m fallin for you and I
Ain’t Got me no harness/

It be women like you that
Turn men just like me heartless/

Honest/

Pussy made
Me an artist/

Pussy made
Me Spit facts/

With that said I’ll speak to existence I’ll hit that pussy from the back and pull out all ya tracks/

Whether morning or night I’ll do
That Pussy right/

If you ain’t in my city
I’ll cop you a flight/

And if you close enough
I’ll get on that turnpike/

Where and however girl
It’s Whatever you like/

{Chorus: RexRiot}

I do no wrong when I
Come and I see you/

Cuz I’m not too proud to
Call you if I need you/

{Chorus:Emanuel X}

Girl, pick up (till end)

{Chorus: RexRiot}

Cuz I’m not too proud to
Call you if I need you/


{Verse 2: Emanuel X}

Niggas is Mad
That I got her/

This the palomar
Not the ramada/

Be a part of
My armada

This is not
A sonata/

I Keep my cheese together
Like a lot of ricotta/

Introduce me to ya mom I
Got a lot for her daughter/

When I get to where I want
To imma fly to ya charter/

Forty thousand feet up and
I’m bumpin the Barter/

Hold me down and one day
Soon We’ll be in Bahamas/

For now I’ll
Be ya late night/

I hope that we
Stay tight/

I ain’t tryna
Play fight/

Shit call me When
There’s day light/

You know how
I like it/

There ain’t
Nothing like it/

But I ain’t playin
Sidekick/

Know what you
Need I’m psychic/

That’s just my intuition
And you said I should listen/

I know you like ambition
Speak goals into fruition/

Ha, well so much for wishin
Grind until it’s existin/

Dollars fall from up high
I think I paid her tuition/

And I dropped out twice
Damn that’s a shame/

Stupidity and self belief honestly
Feel like they are just one in the same/

But/

I guess everything come back
Full circle like a 360/

You independent but know you can
Call me up whenever you miss me/


{Chorus: RexRiot}

I do no wrong when I
Come and I see you/

Cuz I’m not too proud to
Call you if I need you/

{Chorus:Emanuel X}

Girl, pick up (till end)

{Chorus: RexRiot}

Cuz I’m not too proud to
Call you if I need you/
