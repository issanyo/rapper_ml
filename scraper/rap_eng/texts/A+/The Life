[Intro]
Come on, come on
Yeah
Feel good don't it?

[Verse 1]
This is for warm days and drift away
While the sun sets and the ghetto's play
Long nights on a hot summer's block
When you sip yo brew, and never touch yo Glock
This is for eyes, that cry like yours and mine
To smile again, rise above the pain
This is for you and your crew, the ones that's true
Will always love you, no matter what you do

[Chorus]
Cause it's the life, the life, the life
(The life, the life)
It's the life, the life, the life, life
It's the life, the life, the life
(Yo life, yo life)
It's the life, your life, my life

[Verse 2]
This is for soldier's who bust they guns (bust, bust)
In the name of freedom not the game of fun
True Queens, who raise they kids
Implement the knowledge, show em how to live
This is for those who stand in line to feed their babies (I know)
While were runnin' out of time
This is for the unjustice behind bars
Our lovers, our leader's, our people(our people)

[Chorus]
Cause it's the life, the life, the life
(The life, the life)
It's the life, the life, the life, life
It's the life, the life, the life
(Yo life, yo life)
It's the life, your life, my life

[Rap]
Don't let em miss, miss guide you
They'll have you actin like the sun don't shine
And the sky ain't never blue
But you know and I know it's all about survival
This struggle of our people is like that unraveled
The poloticans they was never in control (never)
It's deeper then that a true battle for the soul
What they want is to bring us to our knees
So my people guard yo life by any means

[Verse 3]
This is for those who know we all gon' die
Set up that way by infinite powers
Those who know the feel of chains
And the belly of the beast and of mental strain
This is for those who have they're own fallen angels
Try'na find a way on
This is for everybody (everybody)
And everybody is so life

[Chorus]
Cause it's the life, the life, the life
(The life, the life)
It's the life, the life, the life, life
It's the life, the life, the life
(Yo life, yo life)
It's the life, your life, my life

[Outro]
Yo, you gotta keep smilin
No matter what
Cause this is the life
What you gon do bout that, huh?
