Yeah y'know
You just get this feeling this, real deep feelings inside
Very serious, yeah
I don't know what to do sometimes
I mean it's really deep, I I don't wanna sound like
Like I'm all mushy or nuttin like that in the first place
Burn that

Yo sir A Plus, though you knew it
Some cats smokin homey I taught 'em how to do it
Ain't nuttin to it I'm a general at this
Medicinal cannabis got me intergalactic
It's a thin line between dub and 8
E'rybody know the one that always come with some weight
And that'd be me y'all, you know what I'm holdin
And my endless dub just keep on smokin
My girl asked once "What dub got to do with it?"
Dawg I got the fuck outta there, I couldn't fool with it
Want to grow it myself, my dub unconditional
Hella shit that got to do with bud in my ritual
Can't go get it on any muh'fuckin turf
Niggas'll lace it up and show you that dub hurts
Ain't nobody fin' ta blow my high today
Because "Dub will find a way," what my mind say

[Hook: A Plus]
Gimme what you got and we can both go in
And before you know it we'll be smoke blow-in
It's my dub song, where the dub y'all
It's my dub song, you got dub for me?
Now if you roll some, and I roll some
Then we can get to blowin 'til our mind go numb
It's my dub song, yeah it's nuttin but dub
This my dub song, where the dub y'all

[A Plus]
Yeah could it be I'm callin for dub, I'm on my wireless
You can tell I chief from my eyelids and iris
Out of all of my people I wonder who the highest
Hiero style, I call my zig-zags papyrus
Baby went broke, she used to pay for me
Got me like "You took yo' dub away from me~!"
"I Need Dub," I feel like LL
I don't know, I be fuckin up how I feel in the smell
Got me - lookin for dub in all the wrong places
Weed gone, what you mean why the long faces?
Gotta re-up now I'm back my bong blazes
Buzz lit bong I go through all stages
Dub is a battlefield only if it's bamma for real
You come at Adam like that I'mma ill (fuck outta here)
Just lovely things smoked on the bud I bring
She told me that my dub is king, while my mind say

[Hook]

{*lighter being flicked, bud inhaled*}

[A Plus]
Yup, whassup y'all
We gon' take this ride on the dub train
Back to my house, the "Dub Shack"
Chop it up about the things we do for dub
Or what'chu WON'T do for dub, understand me
All I gotta tell you is that, you wanna be cool with me
"Dub will keep us together"
That's so, that's so real
Yeah man, this go out to the Black Eyed Peas
I was like, "Where is the Dub"
{*coughing*} Good shit baby
