What? Unh! Oh Well

They say what they say
Uh-huh
But they do what they do
What about you?
They said what they said
Anyway
They did

OK! Ha! Yo!

It a'int testin' my patience
If you question my greatness
Fans will never debate this
Fuck your revelations

Brains changed
Through the chemical agents
I'm brave mane
Better than those
Who never would say shit

They poppin' they lip off
And they often will flip flop
Kill 'em and resurrect 'em
When they coffin get ripped off

Cats easily fall back
I can call that
Immediately all whack
Get your balls back

The world keeps spinning
These twenty four hours
As the earth keeps moving
Bodies three sixty fives

There's more galaxies
Than there's sand on the beach
And I think the universe
Wants me to see the lies

What I want more than anything
Is my trees legalized
Yea that's the way
At least a dab a day
Sunday to Saturday

Suckers be
Looking for
Notoriety
Tryin' me
But they dyin'
Silently
Trying to see
How pious that I could be

They say what they say
They do what they do
But I'ma keep it true
What about you?

They said what they said
Did what they did
But we gonna keep
It raw with this true spit

No deal on substance
No frills
Dope deals
Dope skills on mics
That broke steel

No damage
So Oaklandish
Deep rooted
In the town
Where we compound soul
And street music

Underground dub
Local to bicoastal
To global
Off a load of
Dope potables
Colder than fly vocals
And the uncontrollable urge
To expose the Pinocchios
They bullshit with clowns
This a'int my first rodeo

Polio carriers a'int got a leg to stand on
I'm slappin' empty pockets like I'm practicin' handbone
First person quick scopin'
Tryin' to get my camp on
But addressin' the real
In every letter I put my stamp on
Headphones blastin' like a drummer in my brain
But Katniss got you thinkin' that my hunger is a game
So when I catch firewires they runnin' from the flame
You bastards ass backwards you goin' against the grain

They say what they say
They do what they do
But I'ma keep it true
What about you?

They said what they said
Did what they did
But we gonna keep
It raw with this true spit

Suckers be
Looking for
Notoriety
Tryin' me

I'm brave mane
Better than those
Who never would say shit

No frills
Dope deals
Dope skills on mics
That broke steel

OK!
People be leaking and thinkin' they strong
When they really weak and not peepin' them
Look at me, get why they tweakin'
But then

I begin speakin'
Some of the things
That my pen be leakin'
Even English comedy brings

The song that I'm singin'
Is swingin'
And I hope you get the meanin'
Even if it's a
Minor inconvenience

That's my word
You say it then display it
Action verb
Engrave it in the pavement
Just to make it concrete
And to let 'em know
That I'm hella indelible
I live my life to the beat

I'm too nice
To have to be nice
But before I knew that shit
I paid a hell of a price

Everybody got an impurity
Call the security
Speak freely and
Cure the disease
With ease

That's the common denominator
That made a nominal figure greater
And degraded the drama of a hater!

They say what they say
They do what they do
But I'ma keep it true
What about you?

They said what they said
Did what they did
But we gonna keep
It raw with this true spit

They say what they say
They do what they do
But I'ma keep it true
What about you?

They said what they said
Did what they did
But we gonna keep
It raw with this true spit

And they've answered to the drama that a dame said
Show respect to this time past
Oakland niggas showin niggas
Patrollin' these mics while he's aimin' his Tec

Hahahahaha
Hahahahahahahahaha
