[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Stepping, repping, next in line
Don't question mine when you're petrified
Don't bet your dimes, you're set to lose
Going against the grain you better check the news
Natural disasters will wreck your crews
We known to bounce back, get the whole amount back
Me and my crew we respect the dues
You can't count that, can't begin to clown that

[Verse 2: Opio]
Over fascinating, activate the truth
My parents made passionate love who test tube
You in dire straights, Hiero to the rescue
Flow been crowned black check the world renowned stat

[Verse 3: Tajai]
Piling, whiling, we voice the rust
Your style 'n too high, just noise to us
We blocking album, we knocking out the choicest cuts
Tear the house down, rap
Anywhere we found at

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
One life livin' it up
Funk, vibe and we givin' it up
Exercise and we be steppin' it up
We got one life, we be livin' it up

[Verse 4: Pep Love]
Heaving, ho-ing, toeing the line
We blowing your mind into overtime
We on the grind while y'all relax
Act like you know even if you don't got all the facts
Industry is lame, the whole ball of wax
Can't dispute that, we give 'em the truth, black
Everywhere we go on the almanac
We remove that, don't give 'em the roof back

[Verse 5: A-Plus]
Up jump the boogie to the rhythm of Plus
Prefer marijuana over the chemical rush
Rappers with they riddles are really little to us
That shit should never happen like genital crust (ew!)
Your rap is an example of what Ritalin does
Looking forward to your funeral, I rented a tux
I'm riding down the mountain while you slip in the slush
I got one life and I'm livin' it up

[Hook x3]
