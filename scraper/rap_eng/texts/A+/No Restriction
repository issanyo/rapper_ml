[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ye-yeah
Souls of Mischief, baby!
Let him tell you a story, listen very closely

[Hook]
We got style
We make classics
It's hip hop
No restrictions

[Verse 1]
(That's why)
I see this Darth Vader, Schwarzenegger
Movie screen impersonator
My team [?] say to act for the Oscars
Shots heard around the globe
Cockpit to ground control
Souls of mischief putting clamps on these fake records
Coming through screaming like an F-16
And when I see 'em
Jumping offsite like CMW (uh oh)
We like a bulletproof hummer do, rock solid
What's the world coming to, they tryna stop knowledge
Hip hop is college, I'm a PhD, top scholar
We equals MCs, prepare
Electrify your chill like the warden when we were bored, man I warned 'em
No restriction, we kick the doors in

[Verse 2]
I'm licking off lectures, in your prefecture
Textured structure to constrict and stretch ya
Mind with mind, combined and bind, bond is bomb
Leave you looking jaundice jaunts into the [?] we launch, heavy Wisconsin ambiance
Take it to the land beyond beyond, understand what I be on?
Stand behind me on this once, just once, don't front
And watch as we flaunt the staunch supporter of chaos of order
Crashing borders in a most massive fashion, highly reactive
Smack that ass just for asking me to come with anything less than classic

[Hook]
We got style (hip hop with no restrictions)
We make classics (hip hop with no restrictions)
It's hip-hop (hip hop with no restrictions)
No restrictions (hip hop with no restrictions)
We think fast (hip hop with no restrictions)
Do bad dreams (hip hop with no restrictions)
It's hip-hop (hip hop with no restrictions)
No restrictions (hip hop with no restrictions)

[Verse 3]
Maestro sequoia heights
To spin, to leaven the sin
Hover and smother the low end of my full extend
One tenth of my [?] instrument for punishment
Under the event they attempt to apprehend us
It's implementing force to defend my soul from torment
Before your forfeit flung up your modem
[?] catch [?] scrotum
High speed vocals, but corners like a lotus
Full train, locomotive 7-0 she'll be cobra
Only stuck in slow motion
I [?] download a rhyme, a zip drive (zip drive)
And off in Manchester girl is skinned up to my kinks-ah

[Verse 4]
My astonishing flow will demolish you bro
Whether you got knowledge or flow, pay homage to Souls
Ha, 'cause Hieroglyphics is now
Dropped in your town, world renown
Spending yen, dollars, and pounds
Make you rappers polish my crown
Get it nice and shiny (please)
With the Souls right beside me
We all flow quite precisely
We mean biz
You won't believe this
In Buckingham palace busting frees with queen Liz
She said it's only fair
That I pass the mic to Tony Blair
He couldn't hack it rapping, sounded like a homie square
We was all laughing, and he felt foolish
He threw us on a plane to the U.S

[Hook]
We got style (hip hop with no restrictions)
We make classics (hip hop with no restrictions)
It's hip-hop (hip hop with no restrictions)
No restrictions (hip hop with no restrictions)
High rollers (hip hop with no restrictions)
Hey, I am (hip hop with no restrictions)
It's hip-hop (hip hop with no restrictions)
No restrictions (hip hop with no restrictions)

(Hip hop with no restrictions)
(Hip hop with no restrictions)
(Hip hop with no restrictions)
(Giving y'all hip hop with no restrictions)
(Hip hop with no restrictions)
(Hip hop with no restrictions)
(Hip hop with no restrictions)
(Giving y'all hip hop with no restrictions)
