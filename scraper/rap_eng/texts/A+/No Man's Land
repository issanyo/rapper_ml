[A-Plus]
I wanna explain
You wack and shit, you lack the gift
I wanna smack you kid, because the fact you did
An unforgivable crime, wanted to rhyme
Against the smooth master
I move faster, my crew'll blast ya
And I bets you die you gets no ICU
Don't even entertain the thought that I'd be through
Slicin' you
See a nigga like me construct lines to buck minds
You can't corrupt minds
I'm givin' these niggas tough times
I'm above crimes
With "I don't give a fuck" rhymes
Niggas love mine
Mc's see me as unkind, with their dumb rhymes
I can find and track wack, leave 'em standin' frozen
People say A-Plus that man is chosen
I'm the man with hoes and, cash
Fast to catch ya dozin'
There's no gimmicks, no ego trippin'
No backwards flows and
There's no fuckin' whistle
Souls of mischief is destruction
Easily disrupt your facial tissue
Hieroglyphics never late to diss you
