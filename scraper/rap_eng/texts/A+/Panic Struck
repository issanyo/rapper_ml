[Chorus: Opio]
Panic - feeling anxiety, can't imagine or fathom
Why they would lie to me or leave abandoned
Damn it - in the land of the free, we scramble to eat
If you can't compete you harm your family tree
But sitting in a cell you could be sitting in hell
Parallel universe, the world in which I dwell
It's the mastery of fear not the absence of fear
Courage in the words you hear, I spit some truth in your ear

[Verse 1: Phesto]
Envision in metal rise in my extremities
The fibrillating shock I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies
Hyper ventilating my body chemistry faded
We waited for Tajai but did he get eliminated?

[A-Plus]
I hate it, I circled the block, my brain is working the pot
I can't say for certain or not if Tajai is hurting from shots

[Phesto]
Thought you swarming they was serving that scotch
We observing the clock
And every person that walked by is a person that watched

[Tajai]
All I heard was a pop, nervous system slipping to shock
Body twisted and quickly got acquainted with the black top
Blacked out, then my universe became white
Whiteness, I'm surrounded by a bunch of black dots
Now quicker than a nigga could get graced to be alive
Four hitters hit my wiggum with them Gregory Hines
Tryna roly poly, they dropping builders on me
Somebody came with that swift kick that left ya homie snoring

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: A-Plus]
Uh, I can't face the fact I don't know where my aces at
And I ain't okay with that
I'm thinking who did it and where they staying at to pay them back
Why was they placing at, a swim we was laying back
Them boys wasn't playing jack, what you say to that?

[Phesto]
Let me state the facts, Massey missing in action
And all we know is the disappearing niggas was blasting
If he isn't here in a minute and there's no witness to admit the assassin caught him slipping
We looking for that liquid plasma

[Tajai]
Woke up in the black truck they must've put in the back of
Garage door opened and they backed up
Something went like they got a bunch of jackals in cages
Dropped me on the table like a fucking sack of potatoes
Sudden attack from what looked like a rabid lab
Turned my calf to a bloody mess and tattered rags
They duct taped my face as we entered the place
It's getting cold I think we headed to the base-ment

[Chorus]
