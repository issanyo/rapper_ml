[Hook]
This is how we chill from 93 til
From the 14 until
This is how we chill from 93 til
From the 1 from the 1 from the 14 until

[Verse 1]
I don't magnify my mistakes I just appreciate
The lesson nothing less I got no regrets
Still I got more decisions to make more repercussions to take
Find my therapy in percussion on production man
I lay my burdens down by the riverside
One day I'm trynna to see the bigger side
I'm chasing for the light because I've been in dim inside
But shit there ain't never been no fear inside
I couldn't have survived this far man this shit will get you penalized
In this game of life you play you waste another day
If you afraid to grow progression stunted by your pain
I say you stuntin' if you spend your time jumping between today
And everything that's passed you
You can't even see what's past you
Appreciate the present man don't let your gift depreciate
You'll never know when you'll need 'em
My doubt famished because I never feed 'em
Alleviate my clouds just to help me feed the way

[Hook]
This is how we chill from 93 til
From the 14 until
This is how we chill from 93 til
From the 1 from the 1 from the 14 until

[Verse 2]
Clarity, opulence what I see from my optics
Me and my nigga Phoniks rock like geologists
Paleontologists, resurrecting the fossils I'm an alchemist
Savage like Randy I'm steady crashin' just debt it you never had it
How can a nigga live a dream that he ain't seen
Just trynna act out the scenes but don't really know what they mean
How we say we got purpose when we don't know what our worth is
Only know what they tell us on the surface, but I'm digging deeper
That a swishas that I'm hittin' smoke I don't release
Askin' myself whatchu gonna do when they reminisce over you
I wonder if C.L. ever figured it out
Well if he didn't shit I'm living it out
Figured I'd talk to whoever gon' hear me out
My head full just I share my thoughts just as I clear them out I swear it never stops
Therapeutic man this music shit here free my soul
Trynna take it as far as it goes
My God

[Hook]
This is how we chill from 93 til
From the 14 until
This is how we chill from 93 til
From the 1 from the 1 from the 14 until

[Outro]
It was written in ever letter mane
I'm trynna live forever mane
I say I'm trynna live forever mane
Wake yo ass up one time nigga
Til infinity
14 til infinity
2014 til infinity
2014 til infinity
