[Intro]
Heard they was missin' me
Heard you were dissin' me
Well, yeah, yeah
Fuck with it

[Verse 1]
I remember wishin' I could sit at the Grammys with
J and B and Rihanna and Chris, be part of the clique
Second guess myself and all my shit like, "Do I really fit?"
3 Grammys later, I guess I must be pretty good at this
Way, way back in school I was referred to as the weird one
But they cannot deny that music when it hit their ear drums
See 'fore they knew I can sing, ignored by the bad ones
Suddenly they're handin' me vagina like, "Have some"
Suddenly I'm famous, rich, I'm rich and famous folk
Suddenly the world is tellin' me my music dope
10 years later, several million albums sold
Catch me laughin' at these niggas like they told a joke
They doin' anything to go viral
Sell they soul and they dignity for likes though
Tried to tell 'em if there's one thing that I know
Is that they key to your survival is that you be humble

[Chorus]
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) sit down, be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) sit down, be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) sit down, lil' nigga be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) hey, sit down, hey, be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) hey, sit down, hey, be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) hey, sit down, be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) hey, sit down, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
Who is this nigga think he frontin' on Ne-Yo?
Get the fuck over yourself, check your ego
I didn't change, I evolved, get it right
I wrote a song and it changed your whole life
Year of the Gentleman, it made them pull their pants up
Made them wanna dress nice, made 'em get a haircut
Then I transform into somethin' more than R&B
I became music and that's where they couldn't follow me
This shit way too crazy, popped a urban AC
You's a one trick pony, not my fallen homie
Music is a mansion, much room for expansion
I explore the mansion in one room, just standin'
Why? I am Grey Poupon, I'm Evian, I'm high brow
Been inspirin' these dudes for a while now
Never said it 'cause I never thought I had to
But since they talkin' shit, I'm glad to, nigga, be humble

[Chorus]
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) sit down, be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) sit down, be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) sit down, lil' nigga be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) hey, sit down, hey, be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) hey, sit down, hey, be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) hey, sit down, be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) hey, sit down, ayy, ayy
