[Intro]:

Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet
Only through experience of trial and suffering
Can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved

[Verse 1 Oa Aes]:

I came into this rap shit to spread a message
Everywhere I turned I'm rejected
I give love, spread positives
My turn, the same isn't present
These YouTube niggas said fuck him
His SOFT ass his dreams like DR. PEPPER let's CRUSH em
I'm bout 2 SNA-PPLE like a BEVERAGE
Where yo protons?
Why you negative?
I'm in need, ain't nobody give shit
A simple plee, please share this
Do like Ellen & be DeGeneres
You De Generous Degenerates do the opposite
Should I sell my soul to the Pyramid?
Like Joey said
But I'mma sell it to Mike
Jot my name on the dotted line, MURDER INC
Hand my heart to the one eye, Monster INC

Then I'm Runnin'

To The Pharcydescaping my prolems
From the barrel of the Chrome
Black Clouds, fill my lungs

Mos Def

My Respirations failing
Shout out to the LORD for giving
Me the FINE-SSE
Born in 94, from Souls
Of Mischief
Rapping 'Till Infinity whether you like it
Fuck the critics
I don't need your bull shit
Eminem over a bridge
A depressed kid
Snickers, Satisfying his hunger
Of finally being accepted

In the game
Without it being in vain
Cutting till he bleeds from his vains
You never gain til you pain
Pulling Big Sean, steady Swerving in my lane
Opposite of Allstate
So I could give FUCK where you Stan

[Hook]:

Seems like everyday
I'm confused and lost
Fork in the road
Which way do I go
I don't know, I don't know(x2)

[Verse 2 Twerkz]:

It seems like everyday is just another day
The same game play, same haters in my way
Im tryna sit back relax and take it all with ease
Stay up all night with girl and feel the summer breeze
We'll watch the moon rise and my dreams with follow
Live my life to the fullest like theres no tomorrow
I started from the bottom and now im reaching towards the top
Its hip hop, it won't stop it can't stop
Mentality ill turn it to reality
Add some formality it'll turn turn to brutality
Im talking bout my dreams and my ambition
Cause No ones even close to taking over my position
Im on a mission, get a little recognition
Just one condition, its for the love and the competition
Its me against the world as no one else sees my vision
But it ain't stopping me, I make believe to make achieve
Blowin mr. chief to get relieved and make believe
Turn my downs to ups turn my low to highs
Reaching skies feeling wise no need to compromise
They call me twerkz tran, ambition with no disguise

[Hook]:

Seems like everyday
I'm confused and lost
Fork in the road
Which way do I go
I don't know, I don't know(x2)
