This Stoney know me cannon holding fuck that buster Womack
Trust me he going feel my loathing chrome unloading
A Northern Cali alley-rolling bending corners slowly
About to find and smoke this phoney gangsta glory 'fore he
About to ?  like shit stole one from me
About to rock on ? ? ? homey resting in peace
I am the Leader of the New School authoring these streets
Mind over muscle hustle holla holla back with this heat
Must all in silence Womack put this Dungeon Dragon to sleep
My whole Scenario must dramatazing beyond believe
Shit my lady in the hospital with stitches
A baby we just lost and your life's vicious
I must be close I spot his entourage of niggas
Inconspicuous follow the wolf-pack at distance
I got a plan I gotta plan the strategy to get him
That's on the child we lost as longer as this Legend Living
