[Verse 1: Opio]
Alone in the crowd just puffing on loud
Evil eye up in the sky, see the ominous clouds
Rain coming, my play cousin Domino's down the block
I say 'what's up dawg' we both give a pound
Now it's daps all around, my nigga A-Plus clowning
Tajai laughing while he cracking the crown
Royal,  sip the oil then I spotted a stallion
I'm looking at her bosom while she jocked a medallion

[A-Plus]
If it was not for these friends of mine, it would not have been a time
Worth remembering if I correcting a necessitate
Fresh as shit, sparing no expense, like a pharaoh or a prince
Women staring over this, men glaring over chicks
We paying no attention to them sore thumbs
Plus it only makes them vexder when them whores come

[Tajai]
Don't kill the messenger, they stressing doing more drugs
Not to mention if you test them they reach for guns

[Phesto]
I need funds with some versatile out of order
Now I'm posted up by the Eddie Bauer Explorer
In the Wells Fargo parking lot
Sparking up with twelve Argonauts
And formers on the corner wanna call the cops, stop
Bogarding the joint hollering at hoties in the drop top
Summertime crop tops, goodies 'bout to pop out
Tryna seal the deal passing a doobie
They ain't looking at me, they looking through me
At a black duly packed full of hoolies, who these niggas man?

[Chorus]
They rolled past and backed up
They jumped out the black truck
With black mask and black gat
We froze up and that fast
My life flashed before me, time stopped

[Verse 2: A-Plus]
Okay, I'm panicked, we ransomed back to the car that we was sitting on
I see my homie shaking on the ground, I think my nigga gone
Heard some more shots in the distance I'm looking for an exit
Two girls I saw up in the club rode up and told me get in

[Tajai]
I heard the muffler and now I'm running for some cover
Some suckers put they ride in reverse and burned rubber
Got me flustered on my old brother, there goes the summer
Cancelled supper, but I tuck jumped behind a garbage dumpster

[Opio]
Blood is bucking out of the snub nose, I ducked over
Underneath the front of the Nova like what the fuck yo
And caught another glimpse of the villain as he was once mo'
Tryna catch a victim who slipping and make the blood flow

[Phesto]
Hit the corner, tucked the asphalt, barely touched my toes
Nigga tryna shoot my ass off, heard a couple mo'
Then the car [???] block and the shots stopped
I look over my shoulder, bro he aiming with his neck cocked

[Chorus]
They rolled past and backed up
They jumped out the black truck
With black mask and black gat
We froze up and that fast
My life flashed before me, time stopped
