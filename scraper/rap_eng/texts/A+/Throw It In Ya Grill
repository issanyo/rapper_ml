[Verse 1]
Uh, uh, uh
This verse I verse in first person
Don't let my thirst worsen, I'll have the jerks hurtin'
I ain't able to be contained or tamed, it's a thing
Goin' on in the zone, and we ownin' the song
When I'm gone, I won't let nobody press up
Or mess up the scene I set
I ain't even reached my zenith yet
I ain't even endeavored to swim down to my deepest depths
Check it out now, I say what I wanna say
Live how I wanna live, everyday and every way
We make music to get away
From the dread of the ghetto and pray for a better day
Cuttin' the tough talk and doin' the love walk
Or makin' tracks so dope it's uncalled for
Whether politically correct or not
We finna connect the dots when we wreck the spot, uh

[Chorus]
A little bit of this is all I need
Can't wait to get home and smoke—some salmon
Throw it in ya grill then call my seed
And when the streetlights go off, we jammin'
A little bit of this is all I need
Can't wait to get home and smoke—some salmon
Throw it in ya grill then call my seed
And when the streetlights go off, we jammin'

[Verse 2]
People be trippin' because my brain work different
I got a list of rappers that ain't worth dissin'
While we handlin' business, you lame nerds sippin'
My name [?], listen I came first Pippen
A+ venemous, sentences through your tenaments
While they be actin' masculine, actually they feminine
I be makin' you pay if you play with my intelligence
You should trip when they hatin' but they are not irrelevant
Somebody said there's certain topics I can't rap about (what?)
It's cool to talk on them losses that I be handin' out
I be eatin' folks, leave 'em with a bleedin' nose
See the most potent lawyer for my legal woes
We them bros stole cars with the needle nose
After spittin' some bars, it's hard just to be alone
I feel sorry for dog after me that go
We be givin' it to ya as long as the beat'll go

[Chorus]
A little bit of this is all I need
Can't wait to get home and smoke—some salmon
Throw it in ya grill then call my seed
And when the streetlights go off, we jammin'
A little bit of this is all I need
Can't wait to get home and smoke—some salmon
Throw it in ya grill then call my seed
And when the streetlights go off, we jammin'

[Verse 3]
See, they ain't havin' [?] about two, three days
Just rockin' somethin' to block UV rays
They say master your art and it truly pays
Tried to school me, buddy, a newbie
I been there, partner we split ends like bent hairs
The east of the Airs, he left with ten pairs (okay)
This is how we measure success or failure
The green wildlife he copped in Australia
From Perth to Brisbane, it's earth wisdom
Switch up and leave the turf and surf with 'em
He nomadic with no static
We could go at it, but that'd be so tragic
My flow so far ahead of y'all
It's probably playing in the car ahead of y'all
Casual, Hiero, great rhymes
A good business template to follow

[Chorus]
A little bit of this is all I need
Can't wait to get home and smoke—some salmon
Throw it in ya grill then call my seed
And when the streetlights go off, we jammin'
A little bit of this is all I need
Can't wait to get home and smoke—some salmon
Throw it in ya grill then call my seed
And when the streetlights go off, we jammin'
