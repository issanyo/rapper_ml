(Verse 1)
What you know about me and my story?
My innovative inventions my inventory?
Didi, get the fuck outta the laboratory
Excuse me, this music shit can be inflammatory
It could make your head big, get infested
With ideas making you believe you're more important
Than the next kid and the catch is
It could happen to anyone even if you're ready for it
Frontin' like I'm paid when I haven't paid shit
Frontin' like I'm made when I haven't made shit
Act like I'm above y'all like a ceiling of a plane
High and mighty like a Saint when I really ain't shit but a
Basket case who carries himself
In a way, that only he would marry himself
I wanna look into the record where my salaries kept
Because the only thing I'm cashing are reality checks
It's not working
I got into gardens to keep me grounded cuz they always say that you become the things that surround you
And what's around me, had to change
Cuz you become another person when you chasing the fame
I, still got my family I love em so much
I'm, still the youngin' who is hungry as fuck
Time, keeps ticking gotta make it count
And not worry ‘bout the zeroes in your bank account

(Chorus)
Type of shit that make you wanna
Type of shit that make you wanna let go
Type of shit that make you wanna
Type of shit that make you wanna let go

(Verse 2)
Confidence is beautiful
And my music proves it has the power to make me feel like I’m bulletproof
You can put my sneakers on to see what I been through
But most of y’all would only wanna walk inside the newest shoes
And even if they tell you where I’ve gone
Would you like to walk when I didn’t have shoes to try on?
I don’t know if you’d go back that far
To when we came into this country just to have a start
To when we didn’t have the money and we had to starve
Or when I felt like I was nothing and my raps weren’t hard
For real, life’s too short to dwell on misery
I’m here to be happy so to hell with the negativity
We’ve come too far, to front and be fake
Don’t know if you can relate, I just wanna be great
We’ve come too far, to front and be fake
Don’t know if you can relate, I just want wanna be great

(Chorus)
Type of shit that make you wanna
Type of shit that make you wanna let go
Type of shit that make you wanna
Type of shit that make you wanna let go
