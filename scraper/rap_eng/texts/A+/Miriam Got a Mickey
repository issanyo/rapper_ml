[Verse:]
Hostile, green eyed monster
Can’t wrap my head roun it
She don’t want him
Anyone not him
Insecurity locked in
Fed jealous rage
Yea I’m clearly been  [?] in
Set the stage
Now I’m here at her arms length
Nicky and her orange juice thought it was far fetched
Caught her while she’s talkin to her man on Park Crest
Feel guilty conscience as soon as her palms sweats
I know it’s it her blood stream
So why stiff
Everything sounds strange
I’m seeing double all of a sudden
I can’t call it I’m buggin
I got a problem or somethin
Poundin all in my noggin
Knees knockin and wobblin
Feel like I’m speakin to Goblin
[?]
Are people callin my name
Is it all in my brain
[?]
Colluding with the losers
I hallucinate, I can’t recuperate
I’m lubricated, translucent
Losing weight
Wait
I don’t know what to say to ya’ll
All I know is I make it to the top
At the top of the bar two player’s small
Dog get this brawd before she fall and catch a law suite
How you mean she doesn’t even drink
What you want fool
This is cool, this is not you
Somethin seriously wrong
But I got you
No dude
Just come with me outside
I wanna run in the street and see if I can fly
Lights flashin
Smashin pass traffick
Impassioned plea
Please God don’t let her leave
A steady stream of [?]
Gon take the best of these medics to stem it
Vendetta is set in motion
I’d never forget it
Or let it go
I keep the pressure on your womb
Thinkin bout my seed that’s restin in your womb
Seconds move like minutes
My mind is spinnin
But time is slow motion
And I have no notion of what’s next
The technician pump the chest as the fetus flatline
Dying, peroxide flyin
This is homicide
The mama survive
Nobody apologise
Best believe it’s now vengence
I’m out for mine
