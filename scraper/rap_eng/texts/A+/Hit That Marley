[A Plus]
Yo - I cain't steer, feelin like I smoked some beer
Lookin out for the cops but the coast is clear
6x9's bumpin my song, that's my favorite
That way it get played even if y'all hatin
Focus on me like I got y'all paper
It's not y'all paper and I'm not y'all neighbor
I got another thang goin, got to keep the capital gain growin
They ain't knowin 'til we keep the flame throwin
Spit sparks seperately suited to supersoak ya
Don't get it twisted you bitches I'm talkin who is doper
You gettin crossed up, I'm burnin with a barker and bossed up
Doggie it's awesome! Yo
My game new, you don't overstand, I don't bang you
Never been a lame get up in a dame brain
Lot of my people kickin it doin the same thang
It's truly a shame for cats that cain't hang (dang)
They at the bus they like "Follow that cat"
Mad but I ain't make his girl swallow that fasssst
I ain't even wanna holla that baaaaad
Now she blowin up my Blackberry (black cherry)
I be chiefin 'til the sun comin up
Baby that's with me mad at me cause she wanted to uff
I got my mind on some other thangs, fin' ta get mine
Cause I want it mayne, tryin to die get in front of me
No obstacle can stop my pull
It's somethin you gots to know I'm not for bull
Hieroglyphics straight zooter need a 8 straight buddha
If youse a intrude I got thangs to spray through ya
Money and rap fame, the thangs I ain't do ta
Gain, get in your brain and brang the pain to ya
A Plus, I got, too many skills
And I, drink too much and pop, too many pills
When I, see them demons it got to be for real
That's why, I cain't trust 'em I gots to keep it real
(Keep it real) but don't mind me
That nigga Plee be trippin, I be on my ree'
I'm in the cut with baby where you won't find me
I'm chillin in the coozy while she roll my weed, go ma-mi
I'm busy tied up like a hostage
I ain't wastin time on none of you watchers, but here I got this
Y'all just be in some wooden boxes
You don't really wanna lock hips with the obnoxious
I hurt you, 'fore you finish your rehearsal
Hit you up and regurgitate, we smoke purpleeeeeeee
Yeah, and you don't stop, and you don't quit
And you don't stop (and you won't)
I'm Good Time Charlie, I'm with my army
My folks they hit that fo' me, I chill roll, hit that Marley
Hit that Marley {*5X*}
Yeah {*coughing*} let's go~!
Shout out Opio on that track, whattup O
This is my last good deed...
Go on and smoke out
Hieroglyphics y'all, yeah
All the fans out there supportin we love you, knahmsayin
Hold us down; we'll be in your town soon
Burn a few for me I'll meet you there in a minute, yeah

"But I'm not crazy! I'll be back, YOU'LL SEE."
