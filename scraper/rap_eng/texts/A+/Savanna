{Verse 1: Emanuel X}

Ridin ‘round With my top
Open I am not Jokin/

Ever since you left out the City and
Went back home a nigga heartbroken/

If I’m keepin this shit a grip
My lips been sealed I have not spoken/

To you in the fashion that I want might
Peel the blunt and just start smokin/

And I don’t even
Ever get high/

People bring you up in conversations
And I can’t speak I just get shy/

I brought that shit all upon myself And
I know that you can prolly guess why/

For fuckin around I’m notorious just
Like My favorite rapper outta Bed-Stuy/

I Prayed for ya mother when
She was up in the hospital/

I ain’t think living on the Other
Side of the globe was an obstacle/

Now everything
Hostile though/

Might be the cause for
My monster flow/

My choices ain’t
Solvable/

Not responsible plus
You gots to grow/

You remember that you were my tough cookie
And it was my job to soften you up?/

And I said that you would need a glass of milk to get dipped in for that, and I’d be your cup/

Well I fucked up
Not my intent/

Cursing me out
In ya accent/

Us fallin off Is
Never what I meant/

I’d do anything to Have
You back in that tent/




{Verse 2: Emanuel X}

When the fuck am
I gonna make it?/

My brother suffers From autism and
To this day my nigga I just can’t take it/

On everything I love I try to give him the world
But I been with girls I been distracted/

Sometimes I think I use women as a cloak to hide from the fact that my dreams ain’t enacted/

Uh

I’m tired of my mom
Always Getting sick/

And I forget to check on her Cuz I’m busy makin sure that all my hoes getting dick/

I wanna hit a lick/

Cuz I dropped outta college twice to
Pursue music and still ain’t pop/

Window browse at the Rolex store
Too many times and still ain’t shop/

What’s the line between
Patience and failure?/

I don’t even know
How I could tell ya/

Too focused on
Female genitalia/

My one flaw if you
Let Jenny tell ya/

Bump my songs And
Imma neva fail, yeah/

If you roccin w me
Then say hell yeah/

Cuz some want me
Dead or in a cell, yeah/

But I know GOD
Made us to excel, yeah/

Ask Him for guidance Cuz my
Half sisters keep reachin out/

Daughters from my dads affairs Make
It hard to get what he preachin bout/

Even out/

Sprinkle Jesus
Where the evil sprout/

Keep ya clout and
What You hear about/

Cuz he who’s the greatest
Begins as the one that the people doubt/



{Verse 3: Emanuel X}

A good girl
Is all I need/

Can’t find a dime In Philly
That ain’t fuck Joel Embiid/

That’s no knock to you Nigga
Do ya thing brodi I ain’t hatin/

But fuckin dimes and not makin
Millions make me hate datin/

Uh

Honestly make
Me hate waitin/

Wanna pop
So I get cakin/

Cuz I’m dealin with women Now
That used to deal with doctors man/

That tell me they love me more
Because I’m more confident/

Shit fucks me up cuz money
Don’t even equate to effort/

And I got more heart than niggas
Which is the hardest trait to measure/

Models say we look
Great together/

Strippers want
Me To stay forever/

I want to but can’t help worry
Who She think is my successor/

I Wanna date every single girl
That dance in Vanity Grand/

Then take her back to her casa And fuck
Her bent over on top of her vanity stand/

I’m just
A man/

These are the thoughts That always
Tend to keep me up at night/

She tell me Pray more and walk
By faith and not by sight/
