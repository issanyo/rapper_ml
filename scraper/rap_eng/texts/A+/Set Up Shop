[Chorus: Marlo]
Set up shop
Nigga fuck the cops, I got plenty guap
Young Roo act a damn fool with that damn tool
We the gang, nigga try the gang, nigga bust his brain
Bitches lame, niggas droppin' names, that's a damn shame
Bitch wait, fuck a mixtape, I got plenty cake
Yeah I'm rich and I'm pushing weight, that's why niggas hate
Bad bitch, she done sucked me up for them brand new J's
Trap nigga, six phones, doin' at least a brick a day

[Verse 1: Marlo]
Slaughter gang, snatch your chain, dirty face, dirty K
Hundred thou in put up, I got this from the cook up
Sixty two to one-twenty-five, I doubled up
Switchin' lanes in the Hellcat, I done did that
Flip packs, I got big racks, where your bitch at?
Niggas broke, bitches stressed out, I can't help that
Real nigga, I talk brick talk, bet they felt that
Dope money turnt to rap money, watch how I flip that

[Chorus: Marlo]
Set up shop
Nigga fuck the cops, I got plenty guap
Young Roo act a damn fool with that damn tool
We the gang, nigga try the gang, nigga bust his brain
Bitches lame, niggas droppin' names, that's a damn shame
Bitch wait, fuck a mixtape, I got plenty cake
Yeah I'm rich and I'm pushing weight, that's why niggas hate
Bad bitch, she done sucked me up for them brand new J's
Trap nigga, six phones, doin' at least a brick a day

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Young Baby, goin' straight crazy, worth like four-eighty
Three eighty, I got two of those, keep 'em in my pocket
Young nigga get a lot of money, all these bitches jocking
Pussy nigga say they wanna rob me, guess that's why they watchin'
Hold up, bitch I'm froze up, bitch you know us
Them fours up, I be poured up, got me slowed up
Shoebox, fuck a shoebox, that ain't big enough
Big racks, I got big racks, where your bitch at?

[Chorus: Marlo]
