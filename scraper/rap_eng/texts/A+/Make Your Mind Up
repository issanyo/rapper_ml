[Chorus: Guru of Gang Starr (sample)]
Take your time recline and make your mind up
Take your time recline and make your mind up

[Verse 1: A-Plus]
Hieroglyphics is gonna twist a kid's cerebellum
If he lives, then I tell 'em, I'll leave his head swellin'
When tellin' fellas about the 5-6
Live, it's me investigatin' fly chick's privates
I got a plan, I got a plan, a strategy
Adam be mad a G, mad at me 'cause I got a fatter salary
Actually, you will be cookin' like bottom ramen
Never top, 'cause you'll never stop the atom bombin'
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, don't copy
The manuscript - man, you slipped, you're sloppy
Joe Schmo, never no more, I'm clever and you're
Never gonna score cause I'm sure I'm better and pure
Like cannabis, and if it's possible I'll drop a new
Line with the lyrics, live is the spirit
And soul, I got plenty in me, eeny-meeny-miny-mo
Slo-Mo, approach with yo ho, yup
'Cause I'm the man and you can read it in Genesis
A-D-A-M, the A-P-L-U-S
One and the same, runnin the game on fly chicks
Real tight, so they feel right with the 5-6
And it's like that, and that's how it is, G
The skins I cross get tossed like a frisbee
Search and find lines of life in my scripture
Screens make me seen so the keen get the picture

[Chorus: Guru of Gang Starr (sample)]
Take your time recline and make your mind up
Take your time recline and make your mind up

[Verse 2: Opio]
Eruptions, and busting, when I'm thrusting, cuts men
Into microscopic particles, molecules, atoms
Attack 'em, hack 'em, never slow, never slack
I'm invincible [?] the flow is intense at fools
Who know not, flow not like this wizard
Ya play with it, fiddle
Widdle a hole in ya throat and pull out ya gizzard
Trachiotomy, I slaughtta the watery-weak
Ya slips, there's a slobbly geek
Niggas tweek when I speak, they retreat
Rethink what was spoken and then repeat
My feat, of inhuman capabilities, rape and pillage emcees
Then I kill emcees, who have no style
I file niggas down to the cuticle
Who can feel my foot prints
Soot gets kicked in your eye, beautiful
Blinding, winding, up and change-ups
Rearrange punks, when I drops, kerplunk!
Rip chunks, out the mic, and then digest, why test?
I'm cavin' in your chest when I express
Myself, extreme confusion
You think you're losin' your mind
'Cause my rhyme cuts holes like a nine

[Chorus: Guru of Gang Starr (sample)]
Take your time recline and make your mind up
Take your time recline and make your mind up

[Tajai]
Tajai, two syllables, easy
With ease, we, seize thee, butt emcees B
Cause they come wacker than Batman's sound effects
I ground your text, but vertebrae wack I pound your necks
Sally bone, I be prone to Rip shit, likely
Believe it or not, believe it I got the cock-D
Cacophony, I cap the phonies, so there is no needs
For meager attempts, deceivers and pimps know I be
Accelerating on that scale, bats pale the countenances
Of countless knit-wits who wished this
Would mishit, but this shit's equipped with
Homin' devices that are precise as they get, kids
Target's stuck to foes who pose muchly
Fronts be phucked and punk nuts rank us amongst thee
Punks we often cross when soft men
Is the image portrayed to them, spinach is no saviour when
I pop eyes, all of the guys feel my brutish
Strength, and wimpies see haggard futures
Don't tempt me, shrimps be skewered on the barbie
My foot is found within ya, is there any dilemma? Yo, hardly
