Never let nobody tell you that you can't dream
It's a beautiful thing (it's a beautiful thing)
If you workin 9 to 5 or hustlin for your green
It's a beautiful thing (it's a beautiful thing)
When you take care of your seed, you feedin your own king
It's a beautiful thing (it's a beautiful thing)
You could be dead or in the bing but you not, high like you got wings
It's a beautiful thing (it's a beautiful thing)

Yeah, I'm dope enough to have your hundred dollar bill rolled up
Headed for my CD when the cops show up
When they ask you where you get the stuff
Say, "Compound yeah that's what's up~!"
50 years ago we sayin thanks for chitlins
Now this hip-hop music got us bankin millions
Thank them older white people wanna spank they children
(Oakland) Killafornia is the state we live in
Goin out to my people all over the earth
Better look inside yourself so you can know what you worth
I done put in both illegal and legitimate work
Now I finally started gettin the perks, no longer dealin with jerks
My mind abstract, my grind NASDAQ
Hip-Hop cat with a 9 in the backpack
Protectin my seed and my beautiful queen
I love life, it's a beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing

Ay whattup wit'chu? What you fin' to do?
Baby comin through I'm 'bout to shoot through the hoop
Scootin the building you knew it about to do it to her
Blew about 2 without you
Yeahhh it's a beautiful thang
Cause when they get 10 they give 2 to the kang, hmmmmm
My grape and lobster dream ain't to rock a bling
But yeah my boys ring like Dr. King
Your partner clean, baby wasn't sayin nothin they be frontin
Maybe wasn't payin nuttin
I dream on and sing gone
Smash Rockwell is him embellishin his elegance

Beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing

"You fools! You meddling curious prying fools!
I will not be caught by a petty policeman in a country town!"
