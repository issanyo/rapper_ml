[Intro: Young Roddy]
For the ones that don't know man, It was my muhfuggin' first track I ever got on ya digg, me and my nigga Andreti
Shit but thats throwback man. Long long time ago
But I feel it's only right that I get back on here ya digg and share my thoughts
They say 16 ain't not enough but I'mma try to make that fit

[Verse 1: Young Roddy]
Material shit it don't matter
Bet I make it to the top with no ladder
All I need is some weed and some dutchmasters
To make a classic most niggas below average
Blazin' like that shit don't cause cancer
Strapped up like I'm never on camera
Ask question only God know the answer, To
When I get in this game I cause damage
I chase bread with my jet life family
Them dead prez's have got my pants saggin'
I'm bout to hold the game for ransom
She say she like my southside grammar
She said niggas like you should win grammys
Fussin' with my mom, she says stop actin' like yo daddy
I gotta break them bad habits quick
Cause I ain't tryin' to be nothin' like him

[Outro: Young Roddy]
Shit no disrespect my nigga
It always been love, always gonna be love
I guess a brotha' just got different visions
And what that is
