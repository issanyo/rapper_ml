[Tajai]
It gets no fatter
Add another crew to your favo-ritos
Yes we knows our shit is flavor
In battle, I rip it, and niggas hectic after
I flipped the script like a dyslexic actor
You're no factor
I got the type of skills that make you wanna quit
I might be ill and my mic it steals that old beyonder shit
I palm this shit, what's seen next is keen text
Be-ing ex-pelled from my diaphragm
I'm flyer, damn, would you grok it can't you receive it
I bust like cleavage, rock shit, then I leave it
In shambles, cuz I can like Campbell's
A sample of Tajai, is much more than ample

[A-Plus]
Yo, who the hell are you? You're not me
I got me and three brothers that are cocky
To rock the, masses, whippin niggas asses
At last it's, appropriate to show that I can blast kids
I'm quick to stick a dick in skin
I'm figuring I hinder men, so let's sin, and watch this nigga win
I'm making corpses, of course I score kids
I'm morbid, cause it makes me think of more shit to kick
Leave me alone, back the hell up hobbes
I never thought my son would ever try to beat up pops
I got a leather strap, for the fella that
Wanna tell the mack lies, I send em back with black eyes

[Hook]
DisseshowIdoit, I do it, I do it
DisseshowIdo, disseshowIdo

[Phesto]
I ain't trippin, what I'm flipping's on the contrary
To your weakness, retreat if you wanna restrain
From being beat, I freak lifting syllables
So kill the bullcrap, I'm arousing dousing drowning
When my sound swings, I found things
To bequeath, you're beneath, you need relief, to be brief
I crushed ya, flushed ya, from the cypher
Cuz I sliced your life to pieces
In ruins, I screw in, skills like drills
So who and, what army can harm me?
Kill the noise, my boys, never lack poise
But you wack toys get played as I slay

[Opio]
My stick drives you crazy flip it backwards and it plays the
Satanic messages I guess it is my nature
To break your mental barriers to take your body over
Drove ya, off a cliff I got the gift to shapeshift
I encourage say nigga suicidal
The shit I write'll, make you clutch a bible
I got the Cali type styles, I wipe smiles
And smirks off of jerks cuz that weak shit don't never work
Niggas is whack as fuck your over
Get your life together, find some direction cluck nigga
I got the titanium steel verse, slicin' through
With some shit that you'll never ever do

[Hook]
