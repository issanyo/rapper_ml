Never no more, never no more
Never will a sucka score, never no more
Never no more, never no more
Never will a sucka score, never no more

[Tajai]
Message recorded, lessons be stored in
This mental core, it's like lentil porridge
Nas-ty, Massey, be the last g
From medical texts to class me
Ask me, if I had to grip my pad
The riffs I'd grab would rip and stab
The kids that sad, the shit that's drab
And flavorless, and reckless
Your bestest behavior gets
I plays the hits, displays the shit
A razor gets parlayed amidst
And later splits a Philly that
I made ya hit, a relief that I gave to kids
When I punched them
I crunch men, at a function

[Phesto]
Ponder on this, I swallowed the spliff with locution
Encompassing the pompous means, when I escalate my tool
Shins get split, men get spindled, swiveled, pivoted
By my riveting centrifuge
I'm swindling crews, bringing a fist to bruise
Pulverizing skulls annihilating trifling dunces
Pulling rifle pumps to stifle punks when my knifes'll
Split your spleen hit you clean in the kisser
When I twist a riddle I'm breakin' the brittle
And flimsy with my whimsy
Puns and phrases I stun in phases
Terrorize 'em, paralyze 'em paraplegic, when I leave 'em
Mindless, spineless, vertebrate-less with meningitis
I earn 'em swift and minus a life with my nine

[A-Plus]
I get the props, you get the buttocks
I know my what-nots, stopping flows like blood clots
Nah, cuz that's a bad word in jamaican
And I am that, fans pack cuz my jams phat
So get the peanut butter we discover treasure
It's sweet when I stomp you with my feet just for pleasure
Cuz I write the rhymes like a slave'll pick the cotton
The best from the west cause I'm fresh and you're rotten
Take out the trash or I'll take it out your ass
With a blast from the past in the future, I'll shoot ya
But for the present beatdowns will suffice
Lose cause you choose to be down with some mice
You dumb dunces I come once it's my time to
Wanna hear a joke? I'm you
Don't you wish, I won't dismiss your treachery
I bet you'll be, leaving upon a stretcher, g

[Opio]
I'm coming tighter, your rhymes are oreida
Little reminiscent of the poetry I write
A-stoundingly, you're sounding like me, might we
Step outside and settle this, I cause catastrophes
I laugh at these cause my shit is astonishing
Demolishing, you and your following, I'm swallowing
MCs like I was a black hole, ransack those
Wack flows who chose to oppose
I dont suppose, dare or where my stubble grows
Reverses the process, God bless you swing and whoa its you!
Opio, disposes of crews like snotty tissues
I rip through bodies with corkscrews, you wish you never tried

[Hook]

Never again
