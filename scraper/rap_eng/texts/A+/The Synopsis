[Verse:]
Yow, Womack is villain and he livin foul
Cause a  Miriam Stoney wanna kill him now
The child they woulda had ain’t livin now
Womack start to thinkin that he can get aroun
Since losin the battle he’s gettin wild
Went as far as kidnappin a nigga, wow
It’s somewhat absurd on somethin like words
Will fluster your nerves to blood on the curve
When suckers get served
The ruckus occurs
When someone gets hurt
Man fuck what you heard
Prez material
Miriam was merely a material witness to a cold serial killin
Barely alluded her own burial feelin
Stone had a feelin it was Womack
The feelin, won’t go back to prison
So he has a vision
There was no accidental friction between em
Kickin, screamin
Into a squeeze
Don’t squeeze
Hair triggerin easily
Pressed Stoney wearin a vest now
Stressed out [?]
Like a Vietnam vet
Outta the mind
Unborn child who would die
Consumes him with rage
Yes it’s 5o’clock
And you know it’s time for the traffic and weather together
Highway 580 was kinda shady
The gridlock has subsided
Sun’s out thoroughfare is free and clear
Even though it’s a nice day
It wasn’t a nice day for all
The young lady that was struck by a vehicle
Which witnesses described as a black truck survived
But lost her unborn child
What a horrible tragedy
I wanna know what you guys have to say out there
The phone lines are lightin up
Caller number one your on the air
Saudia from Oakland
Am I on the air
The city is gettin so bad
We all feel the same in the bay area
Thank you for the call
Next caller you're on
You know we got to come together as a people
You know, the man wants keep us separated
Thank you for the call
And we have time for one more
You know, I love my city
But I can’t keep my kids here nomore
Wow, that’s heartfelt
It’s gettin bad out here in Oakland
Police are overwhelmed
City is overwhelmed
It’s almost like we need some kinda super hero you know, arite
Obviously we not gonna get this resolved over the phone
But caller stay on the line, keep it right here
Keep it right here
We’ll be right back
