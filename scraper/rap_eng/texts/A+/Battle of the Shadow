[Hook: Del and A-Plus]
They slippin’ dippin’ in and out of the shadows (in and out of the shadows)
By nightfall all this gets swallowed (all this gets swallowed)
The Me and Ple is down to do battle
Cause when the sun shines they gots to follow (they gots to follow)

[Verse 1: A-Plus]
A knows much about the undeceivable shadow
The enemies laughing at you while you acting like an asshole
Extreme darkness makes my people seem heartless
They got me more frustrated then a fiend spark less
You see the enemy is a scheme artist
Right now they be the smartest
Cause your only concern is if you seem the hardest
But you seem retarded, the black man is in panic
You got people saying that God, but acting Satanic
I know god knows
You think you are because you got hoes
Your brainwashed watching to many talk shows
I bet you got flows
But it results in evil
When the only way to be equal or come up is insulting people
The shadow got us realding we think we building
To busy talking shit, or fucking hoes to raise our children
You’ll be amazed when the curtain raises (yeah)
It’ll make you give praises, or say this “who gone save us?”
I’ll remain patient, meditating while they got you waiting
Go to a camp of concentration, I ain’t faking
Man we like the brand new Jews
But the new Hitler’s too big for you to get in your view
For twenty two years, I done battled with the shadow
When my people act so shady, but I’ll still got you back bro
____because you black bro
And if you ever let that go
I'mma see at the rouge upon the plateau

[Verse 2: Del]
I waltzing down the block wit my nigga A-Plus
You know what's up, soaking up rays and vapors
All the sudden it seems like the beams was shrouded by a eclipse
But this happens frequent, some niggas was rolling secretive
They wanted to beat the living shit out of us
If we wasn't talking bout giving it up
Like applause down to the drawls
They said they’d sit by the shadow we better not tattle
____? the sky got brighter
My eye got tighter me and Ple started talking bout
Why we got bitters, fronters, and other antagonist
And whenever we speak they treat us like we were evangelist
No, we’re merely analysts, observing whats occurring like
Who’s doing the serving, keeping our people from flourishing
We mourn about nourishing, who’s deserving teaching courage
Cause the earth's being engulfed and what they teaching is murders
Homicide ___ on HBO’s the ratio
Its so unbalanced
And we know this was established back in the
I always learned to beware of sinners
And those that praise pestilence
Even if it’s your next of kin
Like lot of Americans that hate Mexicans
Or the girl who got raped, so she don’t want to have sex again
