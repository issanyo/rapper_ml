[Hook: A-Plus]
I know it's partly me, and I'm starting to see
This relationship is getting a little hard for me
So pardon me, it's just that part of me
But I'm feeling that it's best if you depart from me
Stop calling me, she keeps calling me
But it's partly me, and I'm starting to see
This relationship is getting a little hard for me
So pardon me, it's just that part of me
But I'm feeling that it's best if you depart from me

[Verse 1: Opio]
Man she said she's suicidal, cut an artery
Every time she write me letters long as War and Peace
And she's starting to sleep and she swore she's a freak
Cause she couldn't hold a candle to my Georgia peach
We just park in the Jeep, sparkling with glee
Remarkably we hop in the sheets
Kama Sutra when I start to swoon her
Our maneuvers start at Z and end at A
It's hard on me to bend that way
How about we get your girlfriends that play
I could rock 'em to sleep, not make a peep
Drop 'em way deep 'til they start to scream
Stay on my team

[Verse 2: A-Plus]
Remember when we layed under the stars and freaked?
Baby all them pockets mumbled were just the bomb to me
When we used to pick up chicks and it was all for me
MÃ©nages got played, so we started to three
Then your friends got in our business and they always weak
Fear it obviously, I mean arguably
If I'm sounding like an ass then I'm sorry to be
Hold on listen for a second before you start it with me
Girls we used to go together like cars and grease
Or starch and a piece, now we hardly speak

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pep Love]
Baby why you behaving so retardedly
You come and blowing up my spot with no regard for me
It kind of make me want to do your body harmfully
But my mommy raised me up to be a charming G
Intlemen, when we're intimate my heart skips beats
Oh yeah, that's the beauty but the other part's the beats
Quite psychopathic, harlot heartbeat
Shrieking banshee, what's the names you call me?
Is that very part of you too scarred to see?
Let this bullish cushion your fall from me

[Verse 4: Casual]
Man killer it's over, skriller in the manila folder
Still a soldier cop the lift from Villanova
She smiled at a wild cat, couldn't understand
I gave her my card in the parked car like she hand it out
Relax, run your hand through this mans from Cranston and take a chance
I converversated out with a glance
How about that long stare, licky lips
Does he on that same shit as Barry Bonds and 50 Cent
I carry on, I'm an artist getting smart as me
She said focus on the business of your artistry
