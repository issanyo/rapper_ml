This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Mmm, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93
This is how we chill from 93 'til

[Verse 1]
No food to eat, all the money's been wasted from last week
I can't even leave, so I sleep in the basement making up rad beats
Hot cup of tea, it's four o'clock in the middle of the night and I can't sleep
It's all on the peak, so bad I can taste it while it eats me

[Hook]
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93
This is how we chill from 93 'til infinity, ah

[Verse 2]
Some part of me feels a little bit naked and empty
I'm stuck underneath a few dirty old blankets to comfort me, hey

[Hook]
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93
This is how we chill from 93 'til infinity

[Verse 3]
And then there's a light and I can see why I'm still alive
Mommy won't lie 'cause if she did I would've died

[Hook]
Oh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93
This is how we chill from 93 'til infinity, ah

[Outro]
We feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration
We feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration
We feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration
We feel the good vibrations
We feel the good vibrations
