(Opio)

I can't escape my thoughts
My mind spirals until the vinyl stops
Hoot and survive the rock
Inspired by the biters who try us on for size
Disguised as rappez, but the lyrics are to massive
My syle has elasticity
I bounce back and take a new shape
You can't get with me
A true writer
My brain has the capacity
To outlast mc's
They reach inside of themselves a vast empty space
They'll never taste victory
I'm sick of these fake ass niggas
They all some bitches
I kick rhymes enriching Hip-Hop, with A-plus on my back we shock the
World

(Bridge)
(A-plus) Gonna shock the world...Gonna shock the world

(Tajai) Whatcha say now

(A-plus) Opio gonna shock the world, A-plus gonna shock the world

(Tajai) Watcha say

(ALL) Souls Of Mischief in tha House

(A-plus)

A-plus without a doubt for real
If you without the skill to turn it out
Get your ass the cuttin'
You steady caught in your frontin'
And y'all can keep on bluffin' but I gotta little somethin'
You ain't know what I got
Who do you think this is
When I rhyme I'm like like your daddy whoopin' on one of my kids
Look at this
Another crew that's caught up in mix
Hieroglyphics turn it out
And now we all up in your shit
It's
Perfectly calculted
Exceptionally rated
People be talkin' but I don't trip and I know they hated
But I be mindin' my business
And as Ty as my witness
We won't die before we get these meal tickets
Now I'm a let you know how It's gonna go fo sho
I stack doe, unveil the mack show
And that's no problem
You got a crew go call em
Tell him withdraw cause we know that they ain't really (  ? )
Come on y'all

(Phesto)

We strictly satisfaction
If they givin' up action
Ain't a minute for slack, cause time is money baby
I can' thold it back
Word to many stacs, Jocci
J-Biz we grippin' Martini & Rossi
Niggas gainin' no speed
Smokin' ashphalt no Ty weed
Straight Oakland style with the hash block
Cash knots in my pocket would knock to blast
I put the e-q to ten
Reminisin' about the hoes lastnight
Waitin' for this fool to bend a coner
A partner hit the gas like a champ, Bumpin' this...
Victory drums and that phat ass base line hummin'
Thinkin' about comin' up before the summer hit
Then bubblin' around my shit for doublin' shows
So promoters sold us more then four biggies with hoes
And hourglass shapes for the souls, e-s-o-'s fine
Diamonds around my wrist is bliss
It's like this y'all

(Tajai)

Punks perpetrate that rudeboy
I roll with Hiero...glypics here to make the bump circulate
Sous Of Mischief man you no we comin' for you with Foldger's
Keepin' flows up until they smolder and eventually crackle
Like you mentally in the back of your mind
You hear that fiendish cackle of mine
I've seen it many times
And I'm a say it again but remain unseen
Cause y'all niggas be sweatin'
Constantly remindin' me
I live amongst thieves who will bite these
But still they rhymes be spindly weight defficient
I leave them shorter then Viscious
Cause them are weak
Cause I gots to pull they hem up it's also known the way I
Do it just watch
Get shot
It's all about the body rock, it don't stop y'all
