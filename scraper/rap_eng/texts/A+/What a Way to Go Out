I wanna join a gang
They'll have my back with gats
We'll walk in packs and stack g's
But yo, I lack these qualities
I gotta kill a fool, steal his wallet, keys, and ID's
But I need encouragement
Initiation ain't enough for me to snuff an innocent fool
Yo I got school on Monday
So one way, or another I'mma fell bad
I need to gain acceptance cuz my reps' been in the trash can
I'm blasting, asking can I join, cuz the big night's here
I got a slight fear I might hear gunshots in my direction
Cuz the slums got a ton of niggas flexing
I started stepping and there stood this young girl
Loaded my hollow tips and followed the dip
Pulled my shotty on the hotty and I blasted the bitch
Wish I woulda known it was my little sis

[A-Plus]
Niggas wanna step, let 'em, I'm gonna get 'em
Pull the trigger finger then I wet 'em
I learned that from my pops, now I wanna pop cops and shit
Slang hots and rocks to hit
Get mine the only way possible
I gots to pull stunts, but niggas starts some bull
Cool, can I kill 'em? of course I can
I know I can, because I call myself the man
I'm out cruising the block that I own smoking a Swisher
When all the rocks are gone, I will be richer
Fiends keep me paid, the shade is mine to lounge in
To broke niggas how's that sounding?
Niggas wish they had my ends- even my friends
They look with envy as I step out of my Benz
Here I am, then they sprayed me
Hey, G, I never thought nobody'd fade me- yo I went out

[Hook:] "What a way to go out, out like a sucka"

[Tajai]
My man, peep it, I used to keep this
Huge shank inside my bomber for drama
On the ave, my boy checked me
Let me know he didn't see me as a v-e-t
Nigga, I said see that bitch at the ready-teller getting cash?
Bet that ass I'mma kill her
Gotta let these niggas know I ain't no sucka
Pulled out the shank, grabbed the bank, then I stuck her
What the- why did I fade her?
I shoulda saved it, put it in my pocket for later
But hey, the crew knows I'm true, though- that counts
Plus I got back when I'm out
Chillin, I get top b-illin
Until with my lil' friends the cops caught me
God-D, the sentence they gave me
I'm in the pen with no clout, but yo, I didn't go out

[Opio]
Holy mackerel, that girl got the fat booty
Like Pam Grier, these niggas is square
So I stepped near with no fear
I drive a Lexus, she got the Nexxus flowing hair
To make a nigga wanna stare
Kicked the Cassanova then I drove her to my castle
Got the freak undressed with no hassle
The butt was firm, made the funky worm stiffen
Reached for my condom, damn, a fat rip in
The packaging, the lubrication was all dried up
Hope that the rubber don't ride up
Posted in the wallet for eons, the neon green was faded
Broke on the first stroke, I shoulda waited
A year later, caught the flu from Sonya
Shot through the clinic, they said it was pneumonia
Caused by HIV breaking down the immune system
(That was my motherfuckin man, damn I miss him)
