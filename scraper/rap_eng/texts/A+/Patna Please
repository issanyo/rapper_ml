Yeah yeah
It's A Plus, this my last good deed
It's Good Time Charlie, what's happenin
Go on roll that up, Hieroglyphics baby
A.G., C-7 I see you
We gon' ride out, smoke this
Yeah

[Hook]
Partner please, I'm off with thieves
Shakin cops and crooks and H-O-E's
Ridin through the East just smokin on my weed
I drive with my knees when I'm rollin up my trees
Niggarole please, I'm A Plee
Hieroglyphics the team that's made mo' green
Shakin pigs and crooks and H-O-E's
I drive with my knees when I'm rollin up my trees

A Plus, Hieroglyphics and I'm makin my keep
Pass out, get out of bed and smoke an eighth in my sleep
It's a couple people hatin cause they ain't who I be
Certain levels we can't speak cause my brain is too deep
I'mma keep that to myself though; game recognize game
I'm teakin out my wealth bro, demonizin klepto
Hang you off of a building and see if I'mma let go
Niggas bitin my shit gon' need a lot of Pepto
Type to poison my own food, I know the antidote
Think you eatin off of me? Fool you and your man'll choke
Adam go get 'em but the niggas don't even matter though
Rappers are scary and they styles are Barry Manilow
I'm in the lab, tireless, eyes aching
Girls blowin me up, my wireless vibratin
I ain't chillin with baby she got so-so head
Finna get a chicken patty and some cocoa bread
Knah-da-mean?

[Hook]

Yeah it go A Plus, uhh, Wagonneers, uhh
You don't smoke, you think it smell bad in here, huh?
Got my shit a little mo' than three G's
And soon as I brought it home fiends stole the TV (what the FUCK?~!)
Left me with the speakers and the dish
But I got somethin for the next tweaker creepin in my shit
And I still ain't replaced 'em, fuck what you think about it
Long as no one break in my crib cause they ain't gettin out it
Leave it at that, I keep it peaceful
Cats'll run up on you like "What you fuckin with me fo'?"
Gotta watch yo' back up in Oakland some niggas e-vil
I be busy makin the beats, watchin my weed grow
People people please calm down
If you see me doin it big when Plee in y'all town (don't trip)
Don't start no drama or youse a goner
I don't wanna have to call Ice Digga {for his salama?}
Knah-da-mean?

[Hook, instrumental break, hook]

Hieroglyphics baby
C-7 T-7 baby
Go on, watch for them po'-po's though
Don't do what I do, don't go to jail over weed
Smoke out though, don't hurt nobody
This my last good deed
Get it while it's good baby
A Plee
