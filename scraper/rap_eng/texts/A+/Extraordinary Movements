[Verse 1]
Stare at my soul, do you see a shooting star, boi?
Whether or not, still got a bulletproof heart
Was tryna climb the charts when yall
Was in community college
Came in this game raw
Still I never wear a condom hell nah
Oh lord, the thought of countin a million
Will it reproduce more sins?
Am I gifted with the pen?
Check my mind you'll find this trouble
Might hit the triple double
Break a couple from I love you to I hate that lyin slut
Cause i'm Steve Francis with the handles
She glorifying man but then she flipped them like a sandal
See I made a couple bands
The women gotta raise the standards
Like to trip, like I was on acid playing Luigi's mansion
Tell the adolecent
Police always ask me questions
Born alone ima die alone
Shoot me straight to heaven
Can I live though I ask them can I live though
While starin out this window
Whirl winds full of kush smoke
I, ran it all along that ain't no fucking secret
Shyamalan six cents (sense) my pockets
All I see is dead people
Sixes black
Mix some red in them
Stack my bread and
Still wondering why you on twitter
Instead of cash grippin
And my familys full of heavy drinkers
40 ounce won't give you freedom
Leave ya hammered, leave your past blistered
But i'ma drink it anyway
Bombay, Ros√©, the champagne
Lets pop all of it!

[Hook]
Give me all of that and all of this
And all of that and all of this
My common sense has
Fallen victim to my confidence
Tell me what the fuck my consciousness
Gimme all that
Just want all of that and all of this
And all of that and all of this
My hypothesis I make a mil I see her bottomless
Tell me what the fuck my consciousness

[Verse 2]
Still dreamin homie
Still dreamin mothafucker
Still schemin on em

Halftime show nutted on the scoreboard

In the Burgh, cuttin curbs
One day i'll get the beamer, yeah

Uncle 8s on

You might see me with some grapes on
After partys with some hoes
Don't remember what their names are
But I remember what they came for
And my flow is like a brainstorm
Put em in the graveyard
Like damn
How we gonna do em like that
Ain't got a chain

Yeah as the beat change I use my mothafuckin magic
Pretty mothafucker with a muthafuckin pagent
From H town to Cali

Take a sip of the summer wine
A way to relax
Take a sip and relax, yeah
Just take a sip and relax, yeah

[Hook]
Give me all of that and all of this
And all of that and all of this
My common sense has
Fallen victim to my confidence
Tell me what the fuck my consciousness
Gimme all that

And all of that and all of this
My hypothesis I make a mil I see her bottomless
Tell me what the fuck my consciousness
