[Hook: Goapele]
They told me the world is ugly
And I can’t change the world, so help me
Try to make me think that I ain’t got no choice
And I ain’t got no chance
These dreams I build ain’t built to last

[Verse 1: Pep Love]
Follow my heart, I bring our vision to life
Create this landscape from formless shapeless sparks
In my inner mind’s eye, this little light of mine
I’mma let it shine, this is my design
Though the load get heavy, the road get rough
I hold it steady until my soul erupts
I changed from lead to gold, coal to diamonds
From the years of pressure living in this world I’m in
To ascend I must transcend
Talk to the wind, dance with the world and come home again
As the Earth spins, and seasons blend
My degrees is 360 when my dreams begin

[Verse 2: A-Plus]
Say you crazy? Man, I hear voices and see demons
Wake up in cold sweats at night hearing screaming
Witness the things most of you people don’t believe in
No, I ain’t dreaming when I be seeing what I’m seeing
That’s why I ain’t got fear for no human being
They can’t kill me, y’all—I’m already dead
I heard a whisper in my ear, I can’t recall what it said
(Except this) When your body stop, it ain’t hardly the end
(So ‘til then) I’ll be decorating my crib, raising my kid
When the enemy come, I’m finna face what I did
A real man, chest out, stomach in
Here it come again
Well keep it coming then
Full circle

[Hook: Goapele]
They told me the world is ugly
And I can’t change the world, so help me
Try to make me think that I ain’t got no choice
And I ain’t got no chance
These dreams I build ain’t built to last
The wind came home and told me
And whispered in my ears, was melting
Take fear from my heart
You broke me like a crystal prism
And life is lovely

[Verse 3: Casual]
It’s the original occupant of the Sudan sands
You can consider this indigenous, I’m one with the land
The journey concerning me keep the world turning
To deal with the ills of your pain and stress
With the finesse of a wild zebra
Grazing in the grass of Madagascar
I’m a believer in healing sativa
‘Cept they’ll buy the belly dance of a belladonna
(The karma’s my armor)
When hyped up, volcanos erupt
I’m naturally gassed, I bust hot fire and ash
The aftermath’s a new land
Expanding God’s creation, giving birth to Earth

[Verse 4: Opio]
From beginning to crescendo, and then go further
Architect of frequency, each MC you heard from
Throughout the planet Earth the symbol of original
Third Eye respected for, Tokyo to Ecuador
Being in your record store, refreshing to your extra
Sensory perception, I betcha
You gon’ feel perfection that’s etched in stone (It’s on)
The stress be on and only follow truth (proof) from flesh to bone
That cell of molecule, what I want most in life is not a jewel
Ascension I promise you
Overcome any obstacle like my pops would do
A mental giant, outsmarting all the cops with new wave logic
Got it?

[Hook: Goapele]
They told me the world is ugly
And I can’t change the world, so help me
Try to make me think that I ain’t got no choice
And I ain’t got no chance
These dreams I build ain’t built to last
The wind came home and told me
And whispered in my ears, was melting
Take fear from my heart
You broke me like a crystal prism
And life is lovely

(Scratched: “Full circle”)
