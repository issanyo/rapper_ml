[Intro: Casual]
You didn’t even get paid for that, huh?
Ah nah, man, you got to get yours
Paid in full

[Hook: Casual]
It go jingle, jangle, jingle for the po’
And once I get my royalty check, you can kiss my mistletoe

[Verse 1: Tajai]
Coagulating, nigga, we gellin’
Rebel yellin’, edutating, the world is ours
Control something, it ain’t enough just to hold something
You know the half, I want the whole sum
Circumscribing with live shit
So when my rivals arrive, they never get the chance to see inside
The all-seeing-eye, seeking, blinking, blinging, bringing forth
A meeting of the tribal chieftans
Me and my brothers pow-wow and building
Trying to turn these thou-wows to millions
Gracefully bow out, until then
Basically, ain’t nobody safe
We body snatch over body breaks ‘til everybody ache
And you can tell by the paper plates
Things of that nature take papes
So we take steps to manifest and move, true
Eye, wide, on the scene, sing

[Hook: Casual]
It go jingle, jangle, jingle for the po’
And once I get my royalty check, you can kiss my mistletoe
It go jingle, jangle, jingle for the po’
And once I get my royalty check, you can kiss my mistletoe

[Verse 2: Casual]
Ay, remember the perimeter when high off the indica
Any sentence’ll injure ya
I’m Cold Crush, in Cali, the gold rush in alleys
Don’t scuff the Ballys
A whole plush Denali will roll up and down thee
We make moves like the Men in Black
Catch us where the women at
Swimming in the similac—stay milky, dumb filthy
Lawyers who defend the niggas they know guilty
Rhyme practitioner curing the rap listeners
Supplying black prisoners with Kit Kats and Twizzlers
It isn’t us, who see ‘em?
I'll have that ass in a museum, exhibit at 2 PM
Scraping a blue BM, rocking the BluBlockers
With bullets strapped to my chest like Chewbacca’s
With true rockers, guns in the school lockers
Who’ll stop us when we doing the do caucus?

[Hook: Casual]
It go jingle, jangle, jingle for the po’
And once I get my royalty check, y’all can kiss my mistletoe
It go jingle, jangle, jingle for the po’
And once I get my royalty check, y’all can kiss my mistletoe

[Verse 3: A-Plus]
Arbuckle, you must wanna see my knuckles
I’m ‘bout flow and dough, I ain’t foolin’ with y’all punk hoes
Yeah buddy, with money, I’m a quick study
If it get muddy, y’all muhfuckas should get from me
(That’s real too)
I’m tryna get mo’ from Bed-Stuy to the O
All the way to where they driving on the left side of the road
You best got what I’m owed
Stack it, bag it, double street platinum
Believe that’s chips, boy

[Verse 4: Pep Love]
I shift your thirty-third vertebrae with my wordplay
Tricked your early bird brain, still thinking the worm came
We move packages and stack cabbages
For NASDAQ averages to increase to the maximus
We taking interstellar trips when we get the cheddar
Ending any vendetta now that we living better
We met, too Netter, and make musical medicine
Back together again, Hieroglyphics better, it go…

[Hook: Casual]
It go jingle, jangle, jingle for the po’
And once I get my royalty check, y’all can kiss my mistletoe
It go jingle, jangle, jingle for the po’
And once I get my royalty check, y’all can kiss my mistletoe

[Verse 5: Del]
Jingle, bring your team, go mingle
Jangle, hang, y’all do your thang, feels tranquil
Same deal
Diablo drill through hollowed skulls for the dollar bill
Call it willpower, now you witness real power
When you put it down for the cause and don’t cower
Allow a, moment so we could soak in
A token, of esteem, now go get the cream
It’s all good, or so it seems, so no extremes
Know what I mean? I’m flowing on a solar beam
Coming through a magnifying glass that’ll fly and pass
Mad amount of mass when Hiero album crash
Like a tidal wave, like a title page
Describe a whole life divided on hype
From lowlifes who hold spiteful vengeance
Nah, you know it’s no time for pretending
