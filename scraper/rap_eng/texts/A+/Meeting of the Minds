[Verse:]
Mi and Womack, a cold cat
Who rolled crap
Sold crack to his uncle
And neva was pro black
No tatts lookin clean cut
But he really dirty
Bro strapped with the 38
Pimp slap your girl
Off the coniac
Snap cone dac
[?]
Until he collapsed
[?]
Waterfall tap then her tell em
Hold back
A known fact that he bought
A fool lately
Got a thing for Miriam
But she been with a dude lately, too shady
That’s how his mind work when he find [?]
He don’t like stoney like I making sure his mind work
Hold in you faces, a reminder
Any philly that ain’t be feelin him ridin with Rhonda
Seem like a real rider
That chick need guidance
Couple seconds beside her see that he
She see that he ain’t bout it
Meet Miriam
Miriam was raised by her sister and them
And her mother and father she always quit listenin to em
Mom saw her spirit glistening since her christening
Use to practice discipline but Stoney why she get with him
It’s a sin, good girls don’t be sippin gyn
She straight laced
But her parent thinks she needed in-tervention
Mixing in with the criminal element
Until she guessed only as she was celebrate
The elephant in the room was evident
Zealous vigaments
What attracted Womack to her innocence
In a sense Stoney never seen him as a imminent threat
When he and Miriam got intimate
Living a myth
The tenements
The village stench
[?]
Don’t feel underexposed to wrongs
But she got her eyes wide open through
Meet stoney
Homie stole cars from the edge
Had holes in his [?]
Then he paid his spread on his favorite thoroughbred and broke bread
[?]
No shit
They sayin Stoney don came up
But some people still see him as the same lame fuck
His partners tryin to tell him to slow down
And he ain’t hearin em
But he been chillin since he been hangin roun with Miriam
But there's a menace that’s livin life in delirium
Hatin on him, they tryin to instill some fear in him
That nigga Womack had a thing for Mimi since Kojak was on tv
And that a known fact
Just like they know Stoney’s strap
Before this pepi lepew pole cats interceptin this
Boo is fittin to be blow back
And niggas really don’t really want that
