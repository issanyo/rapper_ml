I'm so hard headed, I never listen
That's why I cut class everyday it felt like prison
Poppin' at your ex-girlfriend in detention
Tossed her in the library got my duck sick then
The next day I was jalapeno dick pissin'
Raw (that need?) the vixen on a suicide mission
Bad bussiness the pussy had me mystified
Couldn't trust her but I risked my life
Bad business my dog as my witness
Tried to act church girl religious
She had a hit list
Bad business lucky what if syphillis
Or the monster
What you got that all for a boo?

[Phesto Dee]
That's bad business
Spendin' all your time wastin' your time
That's bad bidness that's bad bidness
Yeah what do we have behind curtain
Number three, ghetto fantasy
Young buck sixteen, in a state of emergency
Got you thrown in juvenile hall
Cause you toss a marked car it's stupid
Fit out a Lakeshore
But you wanna bounce over the hill to thirteen?
That's bad bidness
Ten dollar genocide is senseless
You wanna be a pharmacist?
All you doin' is harming us
What about Paris Robinson
Medgar Evers and Huey
They kicked you out of Oakland High
Now you cuttin' up your doobie
You'll be the butt of a few jokes
Like Joey Buttafuoco, don't goof up
And let your youth go lil' bro
That's bad business

[SOM]

Man these niggas be foolish
Trippin'
Mind your business

Mind your business
What's that white shit
You puttin' that in the joint
Mind your business

Slippin'
Mind your business
Trippin'
Mind your business

[A-Plus]
Yo, yo now
You sold some kid a O-Z
But it was only, 24 g's
You think that just cause you a O.G
You can short the youngstas
But who's this fist clinched
With a gat pointed at you damn dude that's bad business
You rollin' with your homie Johnny
In a stolen Mobby
You lookin' slow and groggy
Man get your folks some coffee
You prob'ly ain't trippin' cause you off weed
Then he speed crash now your ass got a broken body
That's bad bidness
Messin' with women with mental problems
Two of my homies got killed like that
They up in some coffins
Stabbed in they sleep
That shit is deep
Prob'ly just got done waxin' they freaks
Peep that's bad business

[Tajai]
When your mind is occupied with thoughts
Of misdeeds hopin' you don't get caught
That's bad business
When the truth is obscured
Made impure
The speakers of it aren't sure anymore
That's bad business
When promises are made that you have to break
Spoken in vain for accolades
That's bad business
When you accept a wrong
Instead of correct a wrong
That shit ain't to be slept upon
That's bad business
When ain't no one in the world
You can call a friend
Cuz you done screwed
All of them
That's bad business
When you look into your own eyes
And recognize you've become all that you despise
That's bad business

[SOM]
How much you pay man?
Mind your business
Man these niggas are new
Trippin'
Slippin'
Mind your business
Slippin'
Mind your business
Hey, when'd you get out
Wait, I thought y'all got five years
Mind your business
Man this nigga's a snitch
Trippin'
Mind your business
Somebody's gon' get him
Somebody's gonna get that motherfucker
Mind your business
What you sellin' crack, nigga
Man that shit played out
Mind your business
Yeah this nigga right here is trippin'
Mind your business
Straight slippin'
Mind your business
You's a (futile?) puzzle flashin' tweakin'
Burpin' sighin' peekin'
Dude you're bad business
Man mind your business
Bad business
Fool mind your business
