[Tajai]
Yo, the jam was fly, oh my now it's over
My batch of pals cut so Tajai must catch a
Taxicab, dag nab why'd they leave me
Stuck in the late night alley, Cali's
Not so hot that everyone should be sweating
Yet nobody's smiling plus crews are piling
Staring, thinking what they'd look like wearing
My gear, I sighed when the yellow cab neared
He sped up cos dreads made him think I'd vic him
Now I gotta dodge thugs like I'm playing chicken
An Englishman, an Irishman
Five or ten Caucasians passed me in their taxis
Oh no such luck I'm gonna get bucked for my apparel
As I seen the black gauge barrel
Just then a fat cab came to my rescue
Damn I'm glad black men drive them cabs too

[Opio]
It seems nowadays cab rides are rather pricely
Especially when the driver goes for self
In spite of the directions that are given
They are driven to cruise backstreets
That treats them to a pricely fare, exactly
What happened to myself when I chose to call a taxi
It pulled up to the curb and I hopped into the backseat
Gave him the destination, said he'd never heard of the place
And I'd have to tell him as we went along, and then placed it in drive
When I said make a left he made a right
Alright, I get it, you wanna make some slight
Detours so you can be sure that you get yours
And when I turn my head you up the bill a little more
I told the cabbie to stop, he didn't think I watched it
Fake reached into my pocket and then jetted like I was Rocket
Ismail his tail light was broken as a token of appreciation
He started chasing but I smoked him

[Phesto]
What? You can't escape me
Mop head, drop dead, deceased
Say your final summons if I catch you
Bet you regret you ever ditched me
Driving, conniving
Guys been robbing me lately
He went up Blake Street
But I'm following, swallowing up steps
He ran to the left, I made a left and crashed
Into a rose bush, my nose crushed on impact
But yo, I'll get him back

[A-plus]
I didn't have enough for a car, what a bummer
I had to get a job driving taxis last summer
All the other drivers knew that my car was spectacular
Cause I had a tight, very bright yellow Acura
Piling in 9 or 10 skins at a time, G
Funny how the honeys with the money always find me
Paying their green to see what color my house is
Feeling like Del cause they would sleep on my couches
I'd charge senior citizens extra, cause they never mention
I'd take all the money from they pension
And I'd drive a blind man around for a while
Even if he only had to travel just a mile, with a smile
And don't let your dog off the leash
Cause if he stepped then I would have to squash the beast
And if you didn't have the right change, don't even ask me
Or I would have ran your ass down with my taxi
