"Whenever they needed him, Oakland could always count on
The cool steady hand of {A PLUS~!}"

Hieroglyphics baby {*2X*}

[A Plus]
Yeah; it go A, P, L-U-S
That's how you spell it you can tell that I am genuine yes
Never fail at what I try cause I don't try I just do
It's little I wouldn't do to get my product to you
We sell records like d-boys sell dope
But what I got won't have you hungry and bummy and broke
You won't sell yo' whip off this, you'll bump this in it though
Gone off that good indo with no chemicals
Wait a minute bro, let me tell you somethin that you didn't know
Where we fin' to go and how we in the dough
Cut the hater out until his face turnin into gold
You can save all the drama that's not what I'm up in it fo'
Hit a homerun up out the park what you was bitchin fo'
Independent dough, Hiero chillin is integral
Journalists foul, I'm cynical up at the interview
(Pussy will get fucked soon as I get a scent of you)

[Hook: A Plus]
Yeah, I can go anywhere on a plane
When I get off there's people speakin my name
(What's my name?) A Plus
I'm known to put the tree to the flame
Lovin the crowd keep repeatin my name
(A, A Plus)
Anybody say that he have to change
You know they lyin cause I keep it the same
{*"A Plus" cut and scratched*}

[A Plus]
Yeah, c'mon
Dey ain't never met nobody like the A
Blowin every 4:20, my folks roll plenty
Don't ask me 'bout a sucker, I don't know any
Really I know a couple but trust me we ain't friendly
I'm on the thin edge of the ledge, gettin bread
But it's still lessons to spread, I'm stretchin my neck
I be uppin my people on shit that'll get 'em ahead
But instead they tryin to get 'em some head (didn't even get what I said)
They loud and aggressive, I'm mild and impressive
With the talent to wrestle or battle any challenger testin
I balance my malice with lessons and manage to check it
In my rap you're subjected from whichever cannon selected
My last good deed, that's my word, never blasphemy
You got cash for herb then you ask for me
It's all science, kick it with a crew of giants
It's game I'm utilizin, your fate is you decidin
