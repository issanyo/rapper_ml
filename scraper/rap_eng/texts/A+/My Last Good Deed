[Intro]
Life crazy y'know you go through changes
An O.G. told me once, you get to the fork in the road take it
Feel me?

[Hook]
Never been one for games muh'fucka'
Just show me what you want me to P (what you want me to P)
I got blood that boil in my veins
For my peoples hangin' up in the tree (y'all rest in peace)
A Plus get to doin' his thang
I tell you what though main, it's somethin' to see (yeah somethin' to see)
I had to holla at Mill', he said
"Plee, nigga, let it be what it's gon' be"
My last good deed (my last good deed)
It's my last good deed (yeah, move out)

[Chorus]
Now when the beats start bumpin and my brain start workin'
And the slang start workin' man the game start spurtin'
Then Plee starts speakin' he revealed y'all weakened
And your team start hatin' when I came y'all curtains
Just A Plus doin' what, he be doin'
If he racin' you can't win, can't beat me to it
And the homies that I roll with, Hiero, Souls, and them
Thinkin' out the box like the 5-0 closin' in

[Verse]
Credibility good in cities and hoods, towns and suburbs
Down South and upwards, what-up (word)
If you with me then you know a nigga puff herb
It keep me calm because the drama make my blood burn
And there's a lot of that shit, some niggas feminine
Aggressive and passive, actin like they half-snitch
It's finna be what it's finna main it was written
I ain't trippin', they peepin' a winner since the beginnin'
Was a, cool lil' nigga in the archives of different shit
Years had ladies believin' that I was innocent
First girl cheat and since then, never been a trick
People be lyin', but shit it be times a nigga slip
In this shit, Plus Souls, Hiero, and mine benefit
Shoutout to the fans worldwide (it been a trip)
Raised in Oakland and you know it homey
I got them girls to "Slow Motion" and "Fast Forward" for me
You know my tangible plans to blow span the globe
Get your mandible broke if you don't pass my 'dro
Never was into games but you losin if you playin' with us
You foolin' with flamespitters, knowhatI'msayin niggas?
The truth see, evil pulled me too deep
'til I died, but I'm back now, look at the new me
The homey Plee he always pass good weed
But now it's over that's my last good deed (kick rocks nigga)

[Hook]
I be on mine, mindin' my own business
But these niggas keep fuckin' with me (why you fuckin' with me)
Always willin' to help a brother out
Really though it ain't nothin to Plee (ain't nothin to Plee)
Never been one for games muh'fucka'
Just show me what you want me to P (what you want me to P)
I got blood that boil in my veins
For my peoples hangin' up in the tree (y'all rest in peace)
A Plus get to doin' his thang
I tell you what though main, it's somethin' to see (yeah I'm somethin' to see)
I hollered at my nigga Del, he said
"Plee, nigga, let it be what it's gon' be"
My last good deed (my last good deed)
It's my last good deed (yeah, move out)

[Chorus]
Now when the beats start bumpin and my brain start workin'
And the slang start workin' man the game start spurtin'
Then Plee starts speakin he revealed y'all weakened
And your team start hatin' when I came y'all curtains
Just A Plus doin' what, he be doin'
If he racin' you can't win, can't beat me to it
And the homies that I roll with, Hiero, Souls, and them
Thinkin' out the box like the 5-0 closin' in

[Verse]
It's almost a crime how I rhyme
I'd probably go platinum if I was lyin' all the time
I'm different from niggas plottin' with crime on they mind
Who wimpy thinkin' he pimpin' relyin' on his dime
I miss the people that passed, my nigga B-Nast'
Know he somewhere in the essence sayin "Look at Plee dazz"
For the people in the future finna turn they back on me
I'm stayin the same all the way down to my last homey
(Plee nigga)

[Hook]
I be on mine, mindin' my own business
But these niggas keep fuckin' with me (why you fuckin' with me)
Always willin' to help a brother out
Really though it ain't nothin to Plee (ain't nothin to Plee)
Never been one for games muh'fucka'
Just show me what you want me to P (what you want me to P)
I got blood that boil in my veins
For my peoples hangin' up in the tree (y'all rest in peace)
A Plus get to doin' his thang
I tell you what though main, it's somethin' to see (yeah I'm somethin' to see)
I hollered at my nigga Del, he said
"Plee, nigga, let it be what it's gon' be"
My last good deed (my last good deed)
It's my last good deed  (yeah, yeah, move out)

[Sample]
(Woman)
"Please follow me, this way
Here we are, now just let me light this lamp
There, now I'll light the fire, it's already laid on."
(Man)
"A nevermind, nevermind thank you. I'll do that myself
Just, leave me now, I'm... tired."
