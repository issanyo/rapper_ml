Artist: Souls of Mischief (artist featured is Pep Love, not S. of M.)
Album: No Man's Land
Song: Yeah it Was You

Bass
And big nuts is what it takes
To get up on the mic and enunciate
Or else your fate
Is disappointment
But give yourself a break
Don't get disjointed from the point
That you was tryin' to make
Ya know
We destined to be fresh
It ain't no secret
Cause these bitches runnin' they mouths
I guess that's cause they detest us
But just rock at them souls of mischief shows
That 94 flow
Leavin' 'em froze
With an infinitesimal amount of aggression for mc's
But still digestable
For the rest of you
To ease up on it
If ya wanna get with it
Ain't no opponents
Cause we pack with components to kill
React if you feel
You haven't been snared and trapped
In the 92 that nigga Cas made y'all scared to rap
The Hierollas
Take it as you may
I never perpetrated to this day
Or did anything that they did
Only catered to the way
That we created and dated
To let 'em know
We kickin' that straight shit
That sacred
Dope rhyme related
Every time they congregated it was us
Definitely somethin' to discuss
Yeah
