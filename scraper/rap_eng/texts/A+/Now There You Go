[Hook: A Plus]
Every time I think we ready to roll (now there you go)
Here come the drama with yo' next episode (now there you go)
Bringin that negativity to my zone (now there you go)
I swear you keep me lookin at the front do', you know?
You get to cussin and you tell me just go (now there you go)
But when I leave that's when you blow up my phone (now there you go)
And call me cryin askin why ain't I home (now there you go)
I swear you keep me lookin at the front do'

Yeah; wakin up in the mornin I'm startin my day right
Fire up that doobie that I left in the tray right
Hop in the shower I ain't awake until I get one
It takes about a hour for all of my mornin shit done
Call the Hiero office tell 'em I ain't comin in today
It's me and my baby one year anniversary
My son chillin, I ain't callin the babysitter
Cause my baby momma cool, she came yesterday to get him ("Bye daddy~!")
Your boy made plans for a beautiful day
I'mma surprise her, with my girl that's what we doin today
I can't wait, on the freeway bumpin some Marvin Gaye
Called her phone, left her a message sayin I'm on my way
I pulled up, 'fore I got out, I lit the tree again
Put it out, got my own keys, so I proceded in
'Fore I could even say, "What's up wit'chu babe?"
She turned around and said "Nigga why the fuck you so late?"
Now there you go

Ayyyy; I should come around yo' ass wavin a white flag
And I can't understand why you behavin like that
You remind me of the fuzz the way you blowin my buzz
'Stead of hearin this I could be smokin 'dro with my bruhs
Prolly fin' ta say these flowers ugly, and this chocolate's melted
I just came from some bitch house if you got to tell it
I'm sorry I cheated but you gotta get over it
And you wouldn't be in this shit if yo' ass was so innocent
I ain't the type to keep on bringin shit up
But how you do it make me truly wanna get in the cut
When my baby momma call she don't be trippin off me
It got to do with my seed, you smoke more than weed
When I plan somethin fo' us you always say I want it my way
And come up with the drama to ruin it every time babe
If I just bounced, you'd see me when you'd see me boo
But I'm really gonna miss the way you give me {gee-nee?} boots

Listen; I don't wanna argue, I don't wanna fuss and fight
I had dinner and a penthouse suite for us tonight
I had it all hooked up, candles and rose petals
Wish I woulda never done shit; I shoulda known better
That type of behavior'll keep me second guessin
You stressin, tryin to teach me a lesson, I bet you PMS'n
Chill with the punk shit and bitch-ass that (what?)
If I wasn't a gentleman you would get backhand slapped
But I'm gone

"And we all saw him, with our own eyes
But I wonder if anyone will ever believe us
Well that's something to think about."
