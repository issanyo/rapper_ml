[Verse 1]

People keep on ragin'
On a daily basis
Smoke don't seem to fade just
Party, party, wasted..
I blend my days and faces
Cold to my decisions
While all this is consistent
I find one thing that's different
You. You, on my mind with impecable timin'
I think you got something I've been trying to find
I see the pain in your eyes that he left you behind with
Psh! You got walls? Well I'm willin' to climb 'em
You a lost cause? Well I'm willin' to find it
You are awesome, I'm just here to remind you
You get me excited...
And I know that we said that we wouldn't fall in love on that night but...

[Hook]

You, You've got me goin'
Caught up in the moment
Rockin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat...
Do you feel like I do?
Do you feel inspired too?
Do you feel the heat?
You, You've got me goin'
Caught up in the moment
Rockin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat...
Do you feel like I do?
Do you feel inspired too?
Do you feel the heat?

[Verse 2]

And when I have the world it's for you, no one else
But until I have the world, you'll have everything else, yea...
And when I have the world it's for you, no one else
But until I have the world, you'll have everything else...
Tell me what you need and I'll make it all work
Just fix where it's broken, Kiss where it hurts
And you need your time I know for recovery
I'm by your side, I'll prove it just trust me
I like to spend my time in Good Company
Are you in love? Cuz damn you look lovely...
I haven't written in months, I ain't lyin'
But you seem to inspire without tryin' so...

[Hook]

[Outro]

You, You got me goin'...
Rockin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Do you feel like I do?
Do you feel?

I doubt it, My Darlin'
I doubt it, My Darlin'...
