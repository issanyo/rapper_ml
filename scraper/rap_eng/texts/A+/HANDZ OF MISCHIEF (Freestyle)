Handz homie/
Fresh off the pick/
Nobody holding em/
Hes front and center/ taking the stage
Crushing the podium
He's like the "R" hands/
Running for pres/
My melody's facing a felony/
For knowing the ledge
I'm on my new shit/
McFly flow seeing the future
"Great Scott"
Big handz on the block/
Lets introduce you
To the meetings of the minds
I'm
Well beyond my timelines
Get crossed
Up under a boss/ moving in force
I'm
Like the epitome
Of Hip Hop in it's new birth/
It's been instilled in me/
And drilled and feeling
New worth/
I'm getting started / at the top of my game
My flow retarded/ in and out of my lane
Homie it's evident
I got the culture dripping/
Outta my veins/ the mic jacked
In the base of my brain
So ya'll irrelevant
Blood of an era / on the piece on my chain/
So I'm in tuned with/
How the pendulum swangs/
I stay ahead of it
I promise ta god
I'm fresher then most/
So why bother fronting/
Just print it real big in ya post
Handz
Spits hard point guard of the young gods
The front of the pack
Lucians with a new squad
Worriors stance /set to advance
Through ya bone yard
And nothings to chance/
Just blood on my pants and these new cards
Whoa-
The decks cut/ and now I'm forced ta play em/
An since it's legal now /the poker games gone
Slash an lay em
For cash the mayhem/ can go on well
Past the A.M
It won't be sleep /that'll help em
Crash an lay em
Uh Uh,No-
Big man Handz/
Guillotine status
Spits blades /as the beat swings
Heads off balance
I'm
One of the slickest to spit it the new veteran
Who's names out here moving the quickest
The young Letterman
Check the jacket for merit badges and patches
Legend like Patrick
Player commentator
Like magic
Whoa-
