Follow me, living is beautiful
It goes like this, living is beautiful..

At seven o'clock I make my way
Out the door to see what is in store for the day
Without the slightest idea of what I might encounter
Through the rays of the morning sun I found a flower
Blooming and consuming light
But it didn't stutter my step, I kept fluttering
Right over left or, is it left over right
With decision on my side and beauty in my sight
And my duty is to exercise, spread my wings
Let the stress subside but my breath just seems
To be taken away as I'm making my way
Up the pavement intent on making my day
And hey, the pleasure I receive's beyond measure
Because I believe I can control the weather
And I choose the sunshine, even though sometimes it rains
My head never hangs in the confines of solitude
I do what I gotta do to maintain my attitude of gratitude
For even breathing, what do you believe in?
How long you've been self-deceiving
That you're helpless, and life is dark and dismal
A thought that I don't resemble and I won't fall into
With all the fine-ass women I see, all the smiles
All the while I'm living I see life is beautiful

[Hook]
Living is beautiful
What, what? It's beautiful
(repeat throughout hook)

Be as I be, see what I see
Paradise is life and living is surviving
Be as I be and you can see as I see

Now, the jewel of existence, you'll love it, listen
Everybody shines, man, everybody glistens
]From the projects to the suburbs, struggling or bubbling
We juggling duties for the beauty that is above
Words' descriptions, makes me want to have a conniption
For the joy of living on this bitch and I don't stop drifting
As the change just don't stop shifting, lifting
The chains off my mind's prison that's trapped
In my brain's cells adapting to sustain health
I'm feelin Master P because there's no limit
To the shit that you can do when you put your soul in it
Take control in it, life is quite delightful
Grab a hold and then it will unfold the riddle
And break the mold, we don't really need em
But what you gotta give me is my weed and my freedom
I come and go as I will, say what I feel
I'm involved with nature and, nah, I don't hate ya
I balance my talents with my self-awareness
And share this with you cause it's true
I don't care if you don't believe

[Hook]

I don't care what it did to them, it's been good to me
And even bad but it's something that I had to go through
To get to this mic I flow through to show you
What I can do with my vocals, it's beautiful
