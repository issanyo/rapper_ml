[Intro]
Yo, Christian's gonna rock to this
My brother would too

[Verse]
You never know what you have till it's gone and it's even worse when you've never had it all along
It's my light, my time, my song
I dare you to tell me you think I'm wrong, Imma go up
And anybody having any doubts, when you see me have the decency to close your mouth
I be talking with my cousins in the south, they've been waiting on the day to hear my albums coming out
The actor with audacity to say that he's a rapper, everyone that knows me say I got my own swagger
Used to be the kind that promoted laughter, now it's gonna be who they send promoters after
Far from a master but better than your sensei
Knew that I could do it I pursued it in the sixth grade
Everybody had kicked a flow to get laid, it's been my therapy until I get my big day
They blind and dumb, I rhyme for fun, and I had the passion in me since I begun
But now it's the end of the world, least it's supposed to be
I think it's just cause you can't find someone as dope as me
Exhale metaphors I don't even try it
Every verse is business so who's trying to be a client?
Sticks and stones break bones can't deny it, but stepping in the ring with a mic don't try it
Monitor my anger, ain't another option, refuse to blow a fuse it can't get to Austin
When shit hits the fan and the pieces start dropping, they can get covered I've been ready for the dodging
Can't stick with pawns I'm a king in the making
Crowns can come down to a thing for the taking
Mind closing off can't trust too many, keep your two cents cause it's just two pennies
Picture in my mind seems just too pretty, if you believe as far as I can dream then you with me
One loss is all it takes to change a man
Mine still leaves me with shaking hands, Sometimes
Just to ease the pain I tried to smoke habitual
But it won't erase away the candle light residual
Tried to be open and tried to be spiritual, didn't change the nights I almost cried I was missing you
But I'm older and wiser and bolder
This giant ass boulders seem light on my shoulders
Throw a couple more I don't mind being chauffeur
Just don't ever blame me for my mind getting colder
Strive for exposure I guess I'm on the come up
I got the glow best be wise for you run up
Deuces up to the Loafers till I luck up
Tryna hit the top, enough if's enough but's
And yup yup no fuck ups cause everybody watching
Never take a break until the clock stops tocking
Or I got a coffin with my name on it
May third 1991 engraved on it
Dinner with the great's maybe we'l exchange sonnets
Way I'm working kinda sounds like a slave don't it?
Smiles from my close ones and tears from my enemies
From 91 until infinity
And I'm out
