{Verse 1: Emanuel X}

They say you get
What you give/

So I'm flexing on women
For ones I still can't forgive/

Everybody pays the price For
The mistakes that they made/

Hurry ‘cane (hurricane) across borders
Like teams in Miami-Dade/

Check I'm fresh like my fade and
My hair fade just like my feelings/

She wear concealer to make up for
What her conscience concealing/

I want a girl that can sing to me
And sound just like Aaliyah/

That's from the hood where
Niggas bang like onomatopoeia/

If I gotta come and see ya
At any time of the night I will/

Might just kill if niggas in ya
Comments don't fucking chill/

But the type that I love the
Type that value Attention/

I been calling it love but
Really It's sexual tension/

The type that don't know
The value that they possess/

She want me for the moment
And I just want her undressed/

The type that always leave
A nigga feeling defeated/

She don't want saving Learn to treat
Em how they wanna be treated/

My nigga


{Chorus: Emanuel X}

You holdin me back If
You won't hold me down/

Lost for too Long and
I still ain't been found/

Searchin for home and
It ain't in this town/

Girls here don't love They
Just love how it sound/

You holdin me back If
You won't hold me down/

Lost for too Long and
I still ain't been found/

Searchin for home and
It ain't in this town/

Girls here don't love
They Don’t love/


{Verse 2: Emanuel X}

If you want something you Gotta
Put yourself on that frequency/

Visualize you freaking
Me frequently secretly/

My demons be
Eagerly Teasin me/

But I got it
Under Control/

Until I hit the rodeo And
See her slide down that pole/

I want a diamond to truly love
Me For me from the soul/

But the girls that I fall for
Don't Be the type to console/

I be overvaluing
Potential/

That be
Detrimental/

They not used to someone sentimental
And gentle it fuck they mental/

So now the good girls I
Fuck with get fucked over/

Cuz the women from my Past
Just made my heart colder/

But I got older
So I'm less naïve/

Easy to perceive if she
For me Or tryna deceive/

Act like a queen to be treated
Like one have royal ways/

Any girl can Leave, I need
You to be the one that stays/

Fuck ya nigga if he want
Static he know not my bro/

Lettem know my woes always tote em poles (totem poles) Like they Navajos/


{Chorus: Emanuel X}

You holdin me back If
You won't hold me down/

Lost for too Long and
I still ain't been found/

Searchin for home and
It ain't in this town/

Girls here don't love They
Just love how it sound/

You holdin me back If
You won't hold me down/

Lost for too Long and
I still ain't been found/

Searchin for home and
It ain't in this town/

Girls here don't love
They Don’t love/
