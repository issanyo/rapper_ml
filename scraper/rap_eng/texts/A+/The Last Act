[Phesto]
Dial on the runaway train with a young protégé
On the way through the skeletal x-ray thing
Not your everyday scene midnight strike in a strange the serene
But I came with the team
Exchange in the green, see the one and only Stoney
And he's hot as Molotov kerosene
You can hear the megawatts hella blocks away
Felons, cops, and party girls sponsors poppin collars
Spitting knowledge and it's quite fitting, written
Off top in the sky crimson , but I got night vision

[A-Plus]
I ain't tripping
It's a party full of naughty and nice women
It would be nice to finally put me some pipe in em
You know we needed to get all fucked up our nights a bit
But this ain't the time for the lights of them
I have been through hella shit this week
So Ima buy some gin and I'm spinning a freak
Never admitting defeat, cause Ima try again
With my considerate speech, this nigga is deep, get him a leash
It's hella women plus my niggas surrounding me
What you niggas drinking? Opio, the first round's on me!

[Opio]
A plea with the goons in the black futon
We eating hella shrooms, and peepin in
Fresh connection, just to get a rep, they flexin'
I'm like ninja man my weapon
Restin the small on my back with one of the straps
Sipping cognac with [?] on ice
An unforgettable night, I step on the mic, I'm devastating
Put the metal in the face of whoever hating
Not the same since they grabbed my people
Fucking psychopathic, he's nothing to lethal

[Tajai]
From the VIP room, I can see dude
And 9 times out of 10, he be clutching his eagle
But we gotta make amends for what the fuck he put me through
How to wreck em here, guess we'll touch him with these tools
Teeny 2-5 up under the suicide
I'ma need a close-up, put something between his eyes
So I proceed the plot on how to make him ride
No time to teeter-tot, it's time to make it hot
Hit the liquid courage, click the little burner
Trick and make the brother the victim of a murder

[A-Plus]
But, Before we hurt em, brother we gotta think of this
Can't just shoot him in the club in front of hella witnesses
Gotta find a small way, maybe this nigga would visit us
I ain't okay with it if we not getting away with it
Just sayin' shit, we need to figure this out fast

[Phesto]
Twisted with the mouse trap, later with a cheese grater
Let the weed sedate him, it's a weed trader in his home
Wanna put a deep crater in his dome
Wired detonator to his phone
Let him play the role, infiltrate the throne

[Tajai]
How can we get him out the building alone?
Into the danger zone, the reign is gone
Go mongo Genghis Khan on this mono
Man it's on, make his blood stain the floor
I can't wait no more, okay? Let's go

[Opio]
I'm waiting, let's floating
High up the crime rate and open
Tajai approached him
Womack was towed back from too many double jacks with cold backs
My whole camp swarmed like green barrages
In Jesus' name, crusade squeeze and aim
Now feel the pain, the steel of shame
How does it feel on the other side of a [?] in your brain?
Might splatter, matter of fact, drag him in back
Seen Stoney in the cut, he was grabbing a gat
Then put it to the temple of Womack's simple mind
And told him, "Revenge is MINE."
