Intro/Chorus:
Never no more, never no more
Never will a sucka score, never no more
Never no more, never no more
Never will a sucka score, never no more

(Tajai)

Message recorded, lessons be stored in
This mental core it's, like lentil porridge
Nas-T, Massey, be the last G
From medical texts to class me
Ask me, if I had to grip my pad
The riffs I grab would rip and stab
The kids that sag the shit they strap
Is flavorless, and wreckless
Your bestest behavior gets
I plays the hits, displays the shit
A razor gets parlayed amidst
And later splits a feeling that
I made ya hit, a really phat I gave to kids
When I punched em
I crunch men, at a function

(Phesto)

Ponder on this, I swallowed the spliff with elocution
Encompassing the pompous means when I escalate my tool
Shins get split, men get spindled swiveled pivoted
By my riveting centrifuge
I swindling crews, bringing a fist to bruise
Pulverizing skulls annihilating trifling dunces
Pulling rifle pumps to stifle punks when my knife splits
Split your spleen hit you clean in the kisser
When I twist a riddle I'm breakin the brittle
And flimsy with my whimsy
Puns and phrases I stun and phase kids
Terrorize em paralyze em paraplegic, when I leave em
Mindless spineless vertabraetless with menengitis
I earn em swift and minus a life with my nine

Chorus 2X

(A-Plus)

I get the props, you get the buttocks
I know my what nots, stoppin flows like blood claats
Nah, cuz that's a bad word in Jamaican
And I am that, grams packed cuz my jam's phat
So get the beaner butter we discovered treasure
You're sweet when I stomp you with my feet just for pleasure
Cuz I write the rhymes like a slave'll pick the cotton
The best from the West cuz I'm fresh and you're rotten
Take out the trash or I'll take it out your ass
With a blast from the past in the future, I'll shoot ya
But for the present beatdowns will suffice
Lose cuz you choose to be down with some mice
You dumb dunces I come once it's my time to
Wanna hear a joke? I'm you
Don't you wish I won't dismiss your treachery
I bet you be, leaving upon a stretcher G

(Opio)

I'm coming tighter, your rhymes are Oreida
Little reminescent of the poetry I write
A-stoundingly, you're sounding like me, might we
Step outside and settle this I cause catastrophes
I laugh at these cause my shit is astonishing
Demolishing, you and your following I'm swallowing
MC's like I was a black hole ramsack those
Wack flows who chose to oppose
I don't suppose, dare or where my stubble grows
Reverses the process, god bless you swing and whoa it's you!
Opio, disposes of crews like snotty tissues
I rip through bodies with corkscrews you wish you never tried

Chorus 2X

Never again
