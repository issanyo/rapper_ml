[J Crow]
Tryin to stay lyrically beautiful
Beautiful like, perfectly checked microphones on stages with wages
Filled with groupies that's right
Beautiful like these piano keys and strings on this track
Exact with my rhymes to the rhythms
Given with soul in Hieroglyphic traditions
Written with love despite the circumstances
Reluctantly I admit the fact that it truly ain't all good
Like world tours, females dujour, and sticky bomb weed
Now I'm on some bullshit inspired
"Fuck all the haters required" presentations
Welcome to the dark side of my rhymes with motherfuckers
Welcome to my last good deed
J Crow puttin in down for my man A Plus
Let's get 'em, we're in the house now fo' sho'

[Singers]
My last good deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-EEEEEEEEEE-EEEEEEEE-EEEEEEEEEED

[Sample]
Goes for a walk every day - scaring every kid that sees him
Grown-ups too for that matter
"That's the one~!"
