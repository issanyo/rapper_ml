Verse:
No flex zone, no flex zone
Cell phones off, no text zone
We cursin', no hex zone
Give me that pussy, no neck zone
We turnt up in every city coast to coast
Double T Tracey with the most
Yeah I'm dope and I don't mean to boast
But I eat wack rappers with some eggs and toast
Don't flex your bar games around me
I got this bar aimed all around me
Double barrelled sawed off shotgun
Blow your fucking face off like you never had one
I'm evil to people who ain't equal
So Evil kill evil to save the people
But people no equal to those who kill evil
Well fuck people
I'll kill everyone to be equal
I'm high off drugs like it ain't enough
The Dopeman give me that magic cough
These pills I'm on are fucking strong
And this lean got me feeling this song
Purple Kush with that pink lean
Gold chain on and a black hoodie
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I'm ready for war like I got the strap on me
The trap for me and my crew with me
These shots of Ciroc ain't nothing new to me
Use to ship a pound every two weeks
Now it's everyday and the dope's to me
Four, five, six, seven chains hoe
Seven, eight inches to blow hoe
Give me top to swallow my brains hoe
And tell them Hip-Hop ain't dead yo
