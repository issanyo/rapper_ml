[Verse:]
Thinkin to myself while I light up the blend
While my people goin off screamin 911
When I called another
Had a ill vibe on the phone
A voice I never heard before
The man a ransom my O
Yow he spoke very slowly
Told me he was holdin my homie hostage
And we better not cross him
Incredibly toxic
[?]
You comin wrong and your head and get Glock clips empty
I simply listened and agreed to his conscious
For my brothers I plea so I’mma get up on my mission
Risky, we movin inconspicuous, swiftly
I know this hoe’s a mischief that’s with me
City illusion of freedom is beat deep in the white
From the we first start breathin
Harsh demons [?]
Even ya’ll start speak to police man if we [?]
Proceedin with the interweaving of plot
Becomin even more intriguin
As delinquents start overheating
The road is squeaking
And the motor’s leaking out
But kept the [?] increasin
As we got closer, reach the threshold
Hopin we don’t carry home a dead load
The angel on my shoulder echoed
We gettin stronger
Forget the dead load
Let’s go we need a jet boat
Head up the west coast
Awaitin patiently
Paces to keep awake
[?]
When they take a break to eat
And later bring a plate to me
I noticed, they changed the detail
[?]
Still a killer but maybe he can be [?]
This basement ain’t that deep
But if I listen close to how they [?] whole  lay out
And explain to me
One way out
Two doors connected by a short a doors
Sixteen step then a hard left
What sound like a chain linked fence
Barkin hounds
Might be sudden death
I can’t quite see what is next
But I’m a man of faith
And I believe in meeting faith head on
I’mma get off when they bring my plate
I don’t know what’s on the other side of that gate
But these cats they seem more desperate each passin day
And I know how money funny
So my buddies ain’t comin for me
Next time that door crack, whack I’mma off runnin
Look, as soon as we see Tajay we snatchin him
Ain’t nothin happenin
We pay no fuckin ransom
Leave em duckin and dancin
We made a few buck from rappin
Now they think we rich
So we trick em with stealth and swiftness
[?] by witness
What’s this
Before we get there we like shit yea
Tajay’s stubblin up out the bushes outta thin air
We pulled him to the van and sat him down and told him sit there
We took him to our doctor homie
So we know he’d get repaired
Nigga yea
But hold the bets
Cause this ain’t over yet
With no regrets
We gon show the threat how cold it gets
If you can’t [?]
Go and get more shit they ain’t know me yet
Revenge is even better when it’s cold as shit, nigga
