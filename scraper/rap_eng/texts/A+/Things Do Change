Things-be chan-gin too-much for-me to fol-low..
Things-be chan-gin too-much for-me to fol-low

So I told her, I'mma call you to-mo-rrow
I'mma call you to-mo-rrow..

This world be fake
So I'm real, everything we do is real
We will kill, we just don't care
Fuckin with you squares - oh like that there
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Man I ripped to be out
I be like what what who I can't figure it out
You figure it out
I sip a oatmeal stout then chill in my house
Probably dip down South, Bellagi-to-the-O
And if found in the lobby with a ho
While the ho Prada's all scholars
Watch us all get rich off of four dollars
I foreshadow the sureshot one, top gun
Choppin with the babes from Austin, Texas
The Playboy models in the auburn Lexus
Complainin how her boyfriend's all protective
A small apprentice, cause now this technique is endless
Cell phone rang, he called speakin senseless (what?)
What the hell is this?

You, you
You talk to me but you got
Caught in the nexus and I'm
I'm free as a bird..

This world be fake
So I'm real, everything we do is real
We will kill, we just don't care
Fuckin with you squares - oh like that there

Pass the blunt, you high enough
Girl I brought you on the bus so you can suck
Not to talk like you talk to my crew you know
Gotta, be on stage at a quarter to one
Girl it's 12:35 can you get the job done
No? Well I'mma show you how to exit the bus
I'mma get another Vicky, I ain't givin a fuck
Man I ain't tryin to be rude or nuttin but y'knahmsayin
I'm not really tryin to talk you, you can get busy though
No? Okay, well we we out, y'knahmsayin, just buy the record
