Check out the way John does it
I thought I had competition but they really wasn't
Was it an ill u sion
The way my bug shit seemed to bruise men?
Yo, I kill 'em with my weak raps
You heard Casual's new shit?
Man, you need to peep that
Super EP
We treat the trooper to
There be no nigga alive I can't beat
But Snupe find me
And who'll try me
I'll stomp ya
T-more said, "Casual's a monster."
I use my mutant powers on niggas shootin' sour rhymes
Hiero it's our time,
So start to panic, cause doper there is
Niggas perish tryin' to compare their's to this weak shit
But it really ain't happenin'. I start slappin' men
Tell 'em I'm the best and they react with friends

[Hook:]
"This is how we rip shit. (repeat)"

Incorrect, when you wreck rhymes
Then respect you collect all the time
I'm your mentor sent for your entertainment
Kid, you'll get your brain kicked
Stop tryin' to do that strange shit
I'm
Rockin mics like cocaine dime
When you jock you slow-brain
I muster strength to bust ya with
Bust your riff, that's a no-no
Yo peep my promo
See how the flow go
Surprise
I chastise and devise
A flow you despise
I'm the assaulter
Who'll alter your brain
When I clipped your sensory nerves
We fence to be heard
Bubbling buffoons get bombarded
But they don't come hard with
Beats, besides that blundering bulllshit
I pull kids back, I'm snatchin'
Progress, catchin' calamity
The famine G's, the ones you not matchin'
And that's on the real, I repeal steel
For any contendant
I send it
Because I intended to wreck shit
Collect clits
And disrespect kids
Then I'm headed for the exit

[Hook:]
"This is how we rip shit. (several times)"

From my standpoint
I can point and pick you out
Kick you out
You slick
You doubt my skills
Where he stood he lies still
Decayin'
These guys ain't playin'
When we tries to slay men
Leave or recieve the cleaver
That'll relieve you of your life
Battle me and that'll be your downfall
I surround all MC pests with the best
Skills
And still you do not be fresh
We testmicrophones with prolificness
And if it's a doozy
Well
I shouldn't be choosy
Just, ripping at will
I'm stripping the skill
Off the run of the mill MC
My whole goal
Is to control your brain
I take the flimsy
And make them practice
So they come back with some harder shit
Try to follow the flow
And see how hard it gets

[Hook:]
Yo, this is how we rip shit (etc., etc.)
