[Verse 1: John Z]

Who's hot? you ain't expect a kid from red dot
To be flowing knowing he showing that he got a shot
To be a damn monster, attention yo I got that
You got as much attention as a myspace contract
People noticed me before I said "i can rap"
Now I'm looking gifted in the present, what a christmas
I ain't finished being number one, you sub for zeroes
Combated against mortals, now I'm lookin' like a hero
I got dreams, to be up on the scene
Destroying you with hooks you should call me kareem
And ain't no fiasco when I tell you I beam
You got a juicy flow? now you know that's a dream
Like my mom and my pops and my bro and my sis
Then I came and I got a little bro ever since
96' like the end of fresh prince
But a new era began and I ask "who'll stop it?"
Huh? who'll stop it?
Changing the game so much, dudes say he's out of pocket
I still charge to the stars like a rocket
Houston, there's a problem, this is me getting started in
13 til infinity
(break) I said
Houston, there's a problem, this is me getting started in
13 til infinity

[Verse 2: J-RoD]

I write my shit for hip hop heads, but hip hops dead
So I'm spitting for some zombies like big pop and them
Spitting like a whole lot of lip locking kids
While they parents trip to get from they kids like bullies
Who be spitting just to get some attention from society
I be so sick like IVs
Spitting like phlegm, excuse me, ahem
I be so sick when rhyming
My brother was born in '93
So I'm spitting for the ones brought up in the 90's
Trying to get by with life high
While my niggas steady living the high life
And my niggas steady spitting what they living giving everything they got
While we chilling on the block and it's hot
Spitting chilly so it freeze spitting willy like we free
But niggas in the pen cuz some pigs and some bids
Easy, cuz they listen when you spit

[Verse 3: John Z]

I'm lost in the world but I roam it
I lean like a tower, but I own it
I'm copping my dreams, while you cop donuts
I ain't killing for the kicks, you dudes can foam up
I'll stay low-key, while you just hoping
That you gonna blow up but it's a cole world homie
Ain't nobody bringing they A-game, I stay bringing it plus
I kill it 2 times 2 before you adjust
With a pen and pad, and I got the midas touch
This is just round 1 and I knocked it out son
No pun, my mind big ain't need no L
I put it on for the city, you feel me? this is
For them ones who workin' from 9 to 5
The ones who want the American Dream to capitalize
And ain't nobody thinking my rhymes would be this fly
The ones I compete with are already in the sky
I mean that more than anything I ever have
My voice gonna have more power than LeBron's hands
You say I'm all talk but what am I doing
I'm talking in a rhythm and I'm doing it smoothly

[Outro]

Cool Nerds! (repeated)
