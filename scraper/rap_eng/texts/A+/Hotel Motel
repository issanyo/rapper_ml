Oh this is just a little beat by Opio, yaknowhatI'msayin
A little tape of somethin
Where's Opio?
Oh Op, I think he went to his room, he was kinda tired or somethin
Why'd he cut off his dreads?
Aww he was sick of them fools always askin him about them
Ohh Phes? I think he dissapeared after the show
Man I ain't seen him since
Where's A-Plus?
