*Chriddy phone call*



{Verse 3: Emanuel X}

Yo


Get a call from my

Nigga Chriddy/


The city

Litty/


Find a bitch with double d’s

And put my dick between her titties/


I titty fuck her

Then dip and duck her/


A nigga under more shit with

His Bitches than A plunger/


I leave em numb-er

Like Droppin digits/


Call myself an Uber and let her see

A van go (Van Gogh) like she at art exhibits/


Bitch I’m a

Narcissistic/


Motherfucker Who can fuck you

Rougher than whoever ya hubby/


Plus I’m the furthest thing

From Ugly so don’t ever dub me/


Too many niggas frontin

Like family fuck up the vision/


But I could never force kin (foreskin)

Like circumcision/


The worst position to be in

Is as someone you not/


And a lot of you niggas

Batti boy bumbaclats/


Roccin designer don’t mean

That You as fly as can be/


Even at my worst you

Niggas not flyer than me/


Women love

Confidence/


More than money

And compliments/


Fuck monuments in providence

Need dominance of continents/


Nigga
