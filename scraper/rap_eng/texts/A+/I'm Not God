(Clams Casino instrumental intro)

(Verse)

Akillezz told me not to go sacreligious
I tried listening but left the devil in stitches
That's why, when I'm on the track, I say I'm rap zeitgeist
Listen to my lyrics- I don't say I rap like Christ
Taking yourself to be the best leads to subterfuge
Which explains the weapon possession charges on all you dudes
You see, I'm Fitgerald, the common man's herald
Discussing the filthy rich whose lifestyle is not sterile
It leaves them in peril, morally bankrupt
So there's no use in hip-hop about getting my cake up
It's time for a shake-up, I'm raising the stakes up
'Bout time Zach De La Rocha told everybody to wake up
Absolute soul on the track, turn me up some
I drop singular wisdom, come with a lump sum
Give me feedback, either position of thumbs
I'm not God, but I'm also not playing dumb; I'm not numb
If conscious rap makes up for lack of conscience
Then the unconscious crap I hear on most tracks is nonsense
Assumptions are made, throwing darts in the dark
The other day I went with my friends to Zuccotti Park
There amongst the protesters was a Boston suburbanite
A drug dealer in a gas mask, a police captain on strike
And listening, I thought about the diversity of life
It's a shame the only thing we have in common is strife
To quote Don Cheadle: "We crash to make contact"
My neighbor and I come closer caught up in a snare trap
And I'm not looking for daydreams or nightmares, for all I care
I just want you there. It's only fair
Bouvet Island, total silence
Is total violence. I give my five sense
I'm not God, nor am I a prophet
I'm just a kid spitting bars right outside the mosh pit

(outro)

Yeah (4x)
I'm not God, yo
I'm not God

Clams Casino... Oh my Jeeeez (laughs)
Based God

Conscious rap
It's making its comeback
Let us start thinking...
Let us stop rapping until we think
But enough talking (laughs)
