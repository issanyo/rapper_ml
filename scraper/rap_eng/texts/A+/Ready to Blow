[Verse 1: Kelvin Jones]
I say I'm...

Ready to blow like a ho that say she ready to go
They be dissing a lot of things but homie never the flow
Now could I be a greater rapper than ever before?
If I stop than Im never to know
Im ready to show the world what Ive come across
These different words got these crows doing somersaults
Im flipping birds to these haters, Thats too deep
Like me in her esophagus while she on her two knees
There really ain't no stopping this even with a 2-3
I'm too "G" I be with a fine honey like Winnie the Pooh be
Ima need five honeys for them to salute me
And 500 thou for them to shoot me, ooh wee
He, is the irrational
Very smash able but never smash-able
Raised in the hip-hop capitol with lots of capital
Now spell it with a capital so all these people have to know
My girls like she just got thrown in the pool, mad wet
Even when I'm disappointing Im good like bad sex
My girl wear less clothes for easy access
Rappers stay on yo toes, like a calf stretch
Infinity and beyond I'm finna be in Milan
Spend 50 g on a charm some pretty things on my arm
Im feel in like any one who dissing me is just wrong
Is probably cause I just talk so differently in my songs
I ain't yelling in screaming Im not rebellin and drinking
Im just reflecting on life and then I tell what Im thinking
Just a young boy with mischief, buried in soul
I told y'all that I'm ready to blow
Now lets go uh...
