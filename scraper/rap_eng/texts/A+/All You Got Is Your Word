[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yo
Rappers talking loud saying nothing, made of nothing
Yeah something walking proud, daily fronting, shady fucker
Air duster, air customs, when wannabes wanna be one of me
But I'm comfortable sonning them, them suckers don't want it please

Falling like autumn leaves up off your knees
Taking your feet out of a [?]
[?] storming the beach, gallantly in army fatigues
Breach [?] the speech

Probably kamikaze the beat, probably unique
Out of your reach, Muhammad Ali
[?] higly intrigued
That malarkey they speak is sloppy next to [?]

The apartment chief, don't call me when I'm popping at freaks
Starving ass geeks, at Mardi Gras you fall in the streets
Stop with the drinks, to cops you a fake
So you swear that you a criminal, but talk to police, you thief

[Chorus]
You saying you the owner when you dropping the lease
And he saying he original but copy your beats
Save me the typical you're not in my league
Claiming you Olympian, never got on the team
Stop playing with them chemicals, they rot in your brain
All you got is your word, telling lies so absurd
Like it's not a concern, that's when drama occurs
All you got is your word, even with dollars to burn
Everybody'll learn, all you got is your word

[Verse 2]
I've done seen it, lowest valley, highest zenith
Life fly by speeding, pen bleeding
Composing a flow that's undefeated, when moments ago
I was a fetus, now notice me grow to a fucking genius

Wimpy flows, never keep me on my tippy toes
More feminine than any woman I've been with before
Rappers be shallow, hollow, frontinâ€™ for real deep
My word's the only thing I can give and still keep

I built on the hill with Khalil Gibran
And I chill with the killers, where my skills was born
Oakland, California, here the mental is strong
In the middle of the storm, but I'm here to live on and on

Keep you lit up like the [?]
Comb with a bomb in the pineal gland they talk silicone
[?] when it's Venice Dawn to dusk
On a skunk while they flunk looking thunderstruck, uh

[Chorus]
And they saying you the owner when you dropping the lease
And he saying he original but copy your beats
Save me the typical you're not in my league
Claiming you Olympian, never got on the team
Stop playing with them chemicals, they rot in your brain
All you got is your word, telling lies so absurd
Like it's not a concern, but that's when drama occurs
All you got is your word, even with dollars to burn
Everybody'll learn
