[Intro: A-Plus]
Yo, 1993- New year, new world champions
Hahaha like this

[Verse 1:]
Yo, the ill-minded mack will find the facts
I rhyme in Acs, niggas bound til I'm attacks
When niggas say I can't rhyme I recline
I'm the first to tell you, I got G's in my verse who tell me
It hurts a fella when I rip, because I'm sly slick
The nigga fly chicks ride with
I'm leaving niggas stranded man that's how I planned it
Landed blows with my random flows
And it goes -- a little something like this
And I might diss, with my right fist I strike kids like a pitcher do
I split your bitch you better switch or I twist ya
I play tricks like a mix
When booty niggas miss the beat
I figure that they wack I go and get my bat and get a pack of Swisher sweets
Plus be ill when I bust the grill but we chill
Who the fattest? {​Hiero}​ It's batting practice

[Verse 2: Tajai]
It's no feat, how I defeat, weaker
Individuals set em up like give and go
A heat seeker, I take a bat and flatten your features
Beseech ya, proving I'll do that too
Cuz when you, pulls my clothes on and shrouded
I'm out with ya grip and you're pimpin so how did he
Do that shit, who dat kid, you're asking the masked man
Who fly higher than NASA
Ask friends what you need when I need your blockin
Then I leave you knocked in
Counts to call I trounce em all
With the quickness, using fitness, leave you fitless
Who got a problem with me ripping all that I do
I'm betting way more than you
Hey sure you knew my rhymes was fly
My lines imply that I'm fatter, next batter

[Hook 2x:]
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
I got a Hieroglyphics baseball bat y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
I swing a Hieroglyphics baseball bat y'all

[Verse 3: Opio]
Get the fuck out, I never struck out
Better get the bucks out, and kick em down
Wrecking, extreme havoc when I'm practising
That could mean a loss of conciousness when I launches this
Back to the scene of the crime I'm never on sight
Untouchable, what you pulled another heist?
Precisely, I's be the man that did it
Said it, free up your posession never regretted
No anaesthetic so you're headed for some suffering
Bufferin can't ease the aches and pains of migraines
When I trail this drain on your lifestyle
Pull a knife while, you give it up, simp
I'm a pimp got your ho and got your dough
And got the best flow in the universe, snatchin titles
Like a purse, niggas be the spot in a hearse
I'm worse, than the baddest, it's batting practice

[Verse 4: Phesto]
It's Phesto so keep your cash flow, Hey Presto
It's gone, right before your eyes, if you're wise
Another heist done nice when I slice
Your neck and snatch ya duffel bag with a sag
And I'm gagging your grill, dag I get ill
Dangerous if it's your brain I bust then take your
Chains and stuff, with the victimising, surprising
And I'm quick to size men, up with a swing to your grill
What I planned difficult that's split your skull
With a tool, if you ever fool, with the Souls
Did you ever think, if you blinked
I wouldn't get you for your links, and your cash and your minks
Savage enough to keep my average up
Puttin chumps in assume a new marking then I'm scotch free
Watch me, duck into the night with your valuables
I'm getting down with my tools

[Hook 2x]

[Outro: Casual]
Hah, whassup? Tell me we ain't the best now
That's how we do! Ripping shit! Niggas don't know...
They ain't the best, cuz we be
That's practice
