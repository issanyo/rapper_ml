[Chorus:]
Ohh baby now
Getback
Ohh baby now
Getback
Yeah!

[Verse 1:]
Ayo get the fuck back dog
Ayo get back think fast react and get cash
Hit the corner on the block homie get stacks
Gotta get that and get back to make you fast cash
Smashing the first mother fucker who talk trash
Click clack you get clap put yo brains on yo lap
More like spice I shoot the heart out yo fucking back
It's a blow back on the war back few [?]
When I hit that I guarantee that you won't last
Outdone I outrun the outcome and outgun
Your whole crew with the gun or without one
I kill you on the beat or even kill you in the street
I can kill you in the studio or do it while you sleep
So get back in mind or else you end up with 9 holes
You frame like 50 minus the survival
Die on the spot player we don't play
I blow yo fucking head off like JFK

[Chorus:]
Get back get back
[scratching] get back
Ohh baby now
Getback
Ohh baby now
Getback


[Verse 2:]
Ay you could fly up with the live niggas
Tredmilling on the Ave with the bumper
Ready to cut niggas in half
I did it for the love but i'm taking the cash
I'll slump you and leave you kissing on the dash
Your new homie throwing up whenever I pass
OG got a glow and show a whole nother class
Grown man caddie no [?]
From the hood, I wish a nigga would smash
You fuckers read a pimp game
This ain't ma [?] thing
Make yo G-thing look like a sheet thing we bang the hardest
I overlook facebook and post out in the street
Beef over the beat, run through I don't pop shit through a tweet
I walk up give you the rack rock you to sleep
This a convict music
Hack says it's all about dates
Him and his man is made [?]

[Chorus:]
Get back get back
[scratching] get back
Ohh baby now
Getback
Ohh baby now
Getback
Best flow in the biz you know what it is
Positive
Git git git get back

[Verse 3:]
I'm a hustler and I swell
Never shame for big money big fame
Spit fire cap city terrains to get game
I strip game believe it there are hoes in yo brain
Bleeding all over the pain and no witness no name
Just a big stain broken pieces from his gold chain
Rome pays the product of ma hood no need to explain
It's the one's to point the finger and blame
You see lay it out slain in the pots looking lame
I do my thing don't give a fuck about the next man
I'm a [?] soldier block wise when on the [?]
I scale grams get grands while I split sams
Spliff can is what the fame when we split [?]
Can't touch us too smart executing game plan
So get back before we put our hands on you and slam
Paragraphing that specs will leave ya no chance
Roll with the best camp

[Chorus]
