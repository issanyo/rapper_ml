[Intro: ]
Yeah uh huh
What's up, [?]
Right here baby
It's Esinchill
Eh

[Hook]
You wanna know why I walk this way
Watch me!
You wanna know why I talk this way
Watch me!
Nigga, it's the ghetto
Eh [?]
Do you walk that way
Yessir
Eh Esinchill
Do you walk that way
Yes
Nigga, it's the ghetto

[Verse 1: Esinchill]
It ain't no secret why I walk with a dip
No, I can paint you a Picasso just offer the lip
Come on 'round
Man, come on down
Just to see what I could do with a zip is worth the trip
It's a rat race, but I can get it in any place
Talk to a corporate exec right to his face
Blew a white collar whatever the case
Man Esinchill's a chameleon put me in any building
Take over the Dow Jones or I can take over the Carter
Or take out W become a martyr
Ain't nothing out here but famine and hunger
Struggle, pain, words that keep you under
But I can make the streets bounce with an ounce
I beat [college?] with street knowledge the truth is in the numbers
I'm that one that gets it done
From the city where the boys say [???] none

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A-Plus]
Yeah they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks
Be on a completely different level than you tricks
Rubberneck niggas in my grill like toothpicks
The homies have to show them how tight could a noose get
I ain't a gangsta nigga, but you already knew this
My crew thick fuck with me they fucking with you shit
In my city it's a gang of niggas that do snitch
Pillow talk soggy in the milk like [?] licks
Chickens [?clucking?] around but most of them useless
Peep the homeless dope fiends most of them toothless
It's evil in the air they try to get you to do shit
Always somebody waiting on the day that you do slip
If you making some dough then they scoping your movements
If you're folding a hoe then make sure she a true bitch
My homie got his face blown off
That shit hurt
Couldn't watch when they put him in the dirt
That's why I walk this way
