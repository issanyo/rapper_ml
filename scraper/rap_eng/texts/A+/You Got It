[A-Plus:] You think you the man cuz (you got it)
[Opio:] People always plotting to scam if (you got it)
[A:] I'm feeling that thick ass girl (you got it)
[O:] What she got might change the world if (you got it)
[A:] You ain't gotta front if (you got it)
Gimmie what I want if (you got it)
Fire up that blunt if (you got it x3)

[Verse 1: A-Plus]
Hey somebody ran up on me like (you got it)
My people hoo-rided and left the dude knotted
They the type of fuck that's known to snatch a fool wallet
Tough turn buttery melt like Blue Bonnet
I gave them a job and that is making you stop it
You can't get it from me I'm keeping a cool profit
Immune to niggerism that was coon-cocted (you got it) say what? (you got it)

[Opio]
I won't say her name just call her Jane Doe
But I spot her like trouble police in plain clothes
Angels start singing when she entered the room (You got it)
Thick Malaysian I met her on the eighteenth of June
A fine summertime day puffin' on a bomb J
She exhaled until we had sex she blew me away
Dipped in the candy walls of miss majestic
Skip the anti-depressant (you got it) her panties the wettest (You got it)

[Verse 2: Phesto]
Hey, I told you about sex on the road
So you kept your control latex on your hole
Only hit them ladies with respect none was ho's
But homie this is crazy it affects one and four
All you can remember bout the chick is it was good
And you ain't got no symptoms just an itching in your foot
Nothing you can't take back, some shit that just passes
Then you start to break out in itchy red patches
Still don't get checked cause you's a real nigga
Until those progress into fluid filled blisters
That bust and pus, feeling like cigarette burns on your nuts
Blood clot! now you're tripping and your whole life is different
And them Valtrex commercials all of a sudden they interesting
But don't cry about it, and if they ask don't lie about it
No doubt about it (You got it)

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Tajai]
You was the team phenom on the scene
Quarterback of the team prime king to the league
All star cheese pro bowl hit the whole stroll
On the solo paparazzi got photos
Tabloids got the mug shot
All them boys that he stepped on to get on top
Say he deserved what he got
For the dollars and the status didn't watch
What you wish for (You got it), you wanted it (You got it)
