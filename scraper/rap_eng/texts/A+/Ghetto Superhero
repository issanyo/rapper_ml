[Chorus]
Ghetto super- Smashing through the sky
And he ain't neva had a cape but he so fly
When you have a problem he'll be by your side
He's on the scene, crispy and clean
Ghetto super- Dashing through the night
Bet that you can cut the tension with a knife
Haven't seen a thing like this in all your life
Cause he's the ghetto super- Fate is on his side
Moving like a shadow in the dark of night
Let me tell you brother man he's out of sight
Where does he go? Nobody knows
(Watch out, watch out)

[Verse 1: Opio]
When I take my time and really think about the choices that I've made
It doesn't leave a doubt the killing's not my lane
I want my freedom and a bullet don't stop the pain
Unless it's me that gets popped

[A-Plus]
Ghetto superhero defend you if you a zero
Been looking for new Dinero to get me some cool apparel
Through the narrow streets and perilous metropolis city blocks
In the ghetto we the cops til the beat stops we'll be needing Glocks
Defeating demeaning plots for freedom keeping it hot

[Chorus]
Ghetto super- Master of disguise
You can see the danger in his eyes
If you're in trouble then just drop a dime
We're called the ghetto super- Has his hand in crime
He can give a damn about one time
He warned you twice don't act surprised
He's on the scene, crispy and clean
(silence)- Capture him they try
He's never going down without a fight
He disappears within a flash of light
Where does he go? Nobody knows
(Watch out, watch out)

[Verse 2: Phesto]
Any villain who's dumb enough to be illin'
Run amok in my vigilant vision finna feel it
Come thunderous on they skillet
Some murderous I'ma kill it
I mastered my metaphysics
I passed it by several digits

[Tajai]
My leverage heavy infinite
Every minute time is tickin'
Drop a dime, shine the signal
See my barehanded grapple any midget foe
With a kingpin fetish perish
They never leave a blemish
Any man or machine phantom menace
Better let the ghetto superhero handle his business

[Bridge]
In the concrete jungle
He is always in a rumble
He may slip and he may stumble
But he won't falllllllll!

[Chorus]
Ghetto super- They ask who is that guy
He's got front, back and side to side
Smack you in the face and make you cry
