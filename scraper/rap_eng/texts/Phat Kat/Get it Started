Yeah
Yo
While y'all just gettin' started
Nope
I ain't finished yet
You niggas is garbage like spam on the internet
I been a vet
Been in the game
Gettin' respect
Cashing them cheques
Overseas, collecting that net
While you're just gettin' your membership
My rhymes never stink
Rhymes I spit
You know they always stay legitimate

Won't speak of my life too much
Just give y'all a little bit
Swiss and American cheese on eggs Benedict
I'm international
Cats, you're game's limited
Homo, vegetarian thugs, all effeminate
Fold
That hand you playin
You ain't winnin' with
Gettin' a lot of static like my cat , he in ??????
The trees I smoke is blessed with the heaven scent
Leave the spot with ladies so elegant
That shit you talk to us stays irrelevant

Why you lames tryin' to stay in the game?
We playin' to win
We're all straight lockin' it down
Lay down clown
Ronnie Cash
Make some noise

They call me
R O double N I E Cash
Two thousand and six
You know we can't be done smashed
Detroit finest
What you call "save the best for last"
Now I'm comin' in first, you leave in a hearse
A lot of suckers want it bad but I want it the worst
It's like the heat in the game
The gift and the curse
Niggas is lames
Y'all need some wigs and a purse
Heels and a skirt
Just for bumpin' your guns you're quick to get hurt

And to my people locked up keep your head up, look
Kat still out here reppin' for you checkin' your books
And I'm a keep some on that
Still keep it banging on these streets 'til y'all come back
Used to freestyle up on these beats now we run rap
Gettin' ???????? music
But they don't want that
They scatter the truth
Hundred percent
Every time I step in the booth
