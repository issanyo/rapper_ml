[Intro]
Yeah
It’s Danger Nigga
Yeah, check it out

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
When the beats bang yo
The Danger is on
Danger like Stallone
Hangin' them clips
Hang up, On and on
I’m telling like you telling your dog it's danger
Like incredible hawks
Anger, angry black man with anger
Aiming a handgun holding a banker
For ransom that’s danger
And you will really be done
If the cops can't come to save ya
Who gon' save ya?
Better pray to your maker
For one more chance to make up
To live more years
It’s danger danger
Like being in a pit with lions
That ain’t have no meal
You’re ate up, ate up
Ain't tough to get roped up and taped up
By niggas with ski masks, that cover their face up
And uh! Man up
It’s time to change the game up
That's danger!

[Hook: T3 + (Black Milk)]
Danger, Dangerous
Both of us 
Aimin', cock and bust
Giving these dudes the flux
You ain't know
Who danger, so dangerous
Gotta a little bit of bang
But don’t bang like us
(It’s Danger, Dangerous)
(Both of us)
(Aimin', cock and bust)
(Giving the dudes the flux)
(You ain't know)
(More danger, so dangerous)
(Ya’ll can’t hang with us)
(Ya’ll can hang it up)

[Verse 2: T3]
Uh, uh, uh
The D is for the dirty dog-matic
Do them dangerous deeds
From Detroit down to Dallas
A is for the A
Cuz we above the average
Ya’ll get the accolades 
Cuz ya’ll is actors
Hell Nah
N is for Nope
I mean never
You’re not next to blow
You’ll never see our level
And the G is for the good god
We really great, they never should’ve
They let these two dudes out the gate
E is for the Every time I see you
Imma get you
And end your little shine
Have you scared to use a pencil
R is for my real niggas
Who know my reasons
Just keep me on they mind
Like girls putting their weave in
O is for Oh My God
They feel hard
They can’t touch these niggas
We above the stars
U S is for us 
It’s just us
Put this together
It spells out, Dangerous!

[Hook: T3 + (Black Milk)]

[Verse 3: Phat Kat]
A hot 16, I keep on deck
For them fans that fiend
Still got them bows on the left
That start to fire breath
Call me Colonel in the hood
My lines are rioting
Stuck yo’ guts out
Doctor said "I ruptured your spleen"
Pseudo thugs singing and dancing
Like Ben Vereen
On the TV, Bopping n' Ticking
More than a chicken
So I don’t watch videos 
Because that shit is sickenin'
Corny niggas names
Not even worth the mentionin
Cock lickin' program directors
For chart positioning
I did the math
Got a new style
You feelin' aroused
Miami Beach, sippin’ coladas
With something to style
Ya’ll still trickin' in the club
The owner run me your tab
The phony niggas need to stop rappin'
And drive a cab
Or be a garbage man
We need people to take out the trash
I’m gonna be honest with you dog
Your whole style is ass
Turn around and gas your black
For classic collab
