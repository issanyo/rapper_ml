Yo, for all the niggas in the D

[Hook]
Don't nobody care about us, all they do is doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us

I bet you wouldn't see a million MC's if it was all about skills
Puffing on blunts sucker sporting Tommy Hill
Figured that that stuff would be so fat
Like the rhymes I bust, and you didn't hear me cuss
Not yet, but it's about to get live in this bitch
You ho niggas done blew my high, now I'm in your shit
Making hits while you other suckers be riding the dick
Bringing drama to your clique, like Susan Lucci
Your style played out like MC Brains and Oochie Coochie
That shit died out, you couldn't keep up with the times
You got to move over, these real niggas 'bout to shine
Like my diamonds on your punk ass in the sun
I bust flows to keep you hoes on the run
Detroit, Phat Kat, straight from the Midwest, never fess
Shit stay fresh like money blessed
No second guessing, the wrong nigga to be testing
Fuck around Swanson'll be your place to rest in

[Hook x3]

I'm that guy who made you suckers wanna rap
I'm that nigga who put Detroit on the map
Been on hiatus, come back and get props like the greatest
Rocking the latest, that's why you phoney niggas hate us
Hearing you hoes got my right hand itching
I've been ripping flows way before the days of the Rhythm Kitchen
Phat Kat, born and raised in this bitch
Niggas claiming my city don't even stay in this bitch
All in they raps, busting caps, selling dope
You and five of your crew, y'all still couldn't ante off of C-notes
Broke niggas kill me while real niggas feel me
You saw me sticking your ho you still couldn't peel me

[Hook x5]

Ayo I see we got a
Up to me we got too many niggas faking
Lying on their digs and all the moves that they making
Chance they taking, trying to roam through my zones
From Twist City, the place where Phat Kat calls home
Where niggas talk twenty four hours on Bernie Mac phones
Catch me at a show, a spot's guaranteed to get blown
Know niggas with hearts so cold they froze like snow cones in the winter
You's a beginner, trying to test this vet (nigga)
So when you see me on the streets talk to me quick
Because you never know what the fuck you might get
So dig it, sugar sugar and um, sort of soft
If you didn't get off it ain't my fault
Remember that, Phat Kat coming with nothing but the vintage
1st Down tear a line out your crew, let's have a scrimmage
While you portraying images you seen on TV
That shit is gay I told you niggas that Detroit don't play

[Hook x4]

(Been in this game for years, it made me a animal)
