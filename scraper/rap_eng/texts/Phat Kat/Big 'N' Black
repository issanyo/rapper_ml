My flow's phenomenal, nigga
Big and black so call me a bondable nigga
When you speaking on [?]
I'm on the tip of your toung
Post it up in the cat cave, stacking my funds
One phone call to my wolves
They put your ass on a stick
I'm in London up in the studio tweaking a mix
Your whole style is bitch, I'm here to switch shit up
Step in the booth, touch the mic
Then watch that bitch lit up
Speaking on me you definitely get your ass hit up
Smack you down to the ground
Now wake your bitch ass up
Got you running telling your frends
That we like, yeah that's up
[?]
You know how we get down
Up in the lab 24/7 perfecting our sound
While you still on the block
Mad hating, fucking around
We getting cake and scratch
You still at your momma's house kicking bass and raps
So if you curse and talk a lot your face gets smacked
No time along with your girl, what kinda space is that
Need to get your own shit, nigga, face the fact
Let me be right and exact
Fuck all you bootleggers
And with my UK connect
