[Verse 1:]
I'm so different no it's not code written this forbidden
Into your Brains no forgetting the whole getting  capoodle podles die
When they throw pits in the pit the pit in your stomach got bubble and and shit
That's fear my money smelling like last year matter of fact the year  before that
Business man with a renaissance rap i go in  my briefcase rock em to sleep for peace sake
Then they reminisce over them my god
My games way above the rim you can say this style is jumping out the gym
Am tim duncan on you hoes list something that they grow it's something you should know You did nothing for a hoe i spill yo pumpkin with a foe with a side jaw
Doggy goes before nightfall trust me you don't want to get you life started in the dirty glove
In the dirty glove ain't it the dirty glove does it fit then you must quit lying about street  life when the b hits the real ones will  take that weak shit
Am nothing nice i bust i break all rules on fake cruise smack the skin off your face have you crying the blues she crazy they put it on the six o'clock news as drama
This is what i bring if you don't pay them dues
Silly niggas you need to do your research see how this heat work
Put your goofy ass face on a t shirt niggas mine they  baby mama fuck me first
Really they need to thank me cause the way they does work
Am t and t with short fuse to strike quick and niggas that talking slick start picking yo casket
Am a grown ass man with that hot spit so it's deeper than rap shit
Fuck around get your mouth wide nose broke and head split
That blast from the pump will left you virtually  faceless
You wishing that you didn't even say shit
But you're a grown man you love to  take risks
Ronny yu and G S you pussy holes go will hate this
In the dirty glove ain't it the dirty glove does it fit then you must quit lying about street  life when the b hits the real ones will  take that weak shit
Trial of the troop let's separate all the doo’s from the don'ts and motion through
The city where you never should  speak unless spoken to
Look around everybody tryin to put it down feeling like
Everybody crooked now villain type clutching on my skin and still
Am feeling a fight coming on  with my light seeing all
And a stable table that turns with every storm
Catching me not holding this rare form
You’ve been warned it's a message through the song
Cuz shell shock i learned on hells block where they dabbled in drugs and splatter the walls and tell cops
In the dirty glove ain't it the dirty glove does it fit then you must quit lying about street  life when the b hits the real ones will  take that weak shit
In the dirty glove ain't it the dirty glove does it fit then you must quit lying about street  life when the b hits the real ones will  take that weak shit
Shut it down
