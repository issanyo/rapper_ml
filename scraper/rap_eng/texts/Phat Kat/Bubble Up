[Chorus]
Yeah, it's time to bubble up
Phat Kat for Ronnie Euro, I'm on a double up
Gloves off, you suckas better knuckle up
The road was rough, I had to buckle up

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's time to bubble up
Phat Kat for Ronnie Euro, I'm on a double up
Gloves off, you suckas better knuckle up
The road was rough so I had to buckle up

[Verse 1]
Aye, y'all cart hoppin', steady beggin' for favors
I'm pullin' up in some [?], bitches catching the vapors
Silly ass happy, a few labels tryin' to date ya
But in the end all they really try to do is rape ya
Fuck a handout, you better become your own saviour
Through all labor minor figures become major
Now they listenin'
Keep ya tunnel vision while they callin' for chart positionin'
Find yo ass in the same river motowners be fishin' in
In a crush you brawny suckas ask who my mission is
Bad boy 89, Detroit pasted and shit
Kat, you died, but you know how it's finna get

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's time to bubble up
Phat Kat for Ronnie Euro, I'm on a double up
Gloves off, you suckas better knuckle up
The road was rough, I had to buckle up

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's time to bubble up (That's right)
Phat Kat for Ronnie Euro, I'm on a double up
Gloves off, you suckas better knuckle up
The road was rough so I had to buckle up

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's time to bubble up
Phat Kat for Ronnie Euro, I'm on a double up
Gloves off, you suckas better knuckle up
The road was rough, I had to buckle up

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
We got 8 million stories in my city, here's one
Never leave your house without packin ya gun
Where I'm from everybody got a CCW
Dirty [?] on the hunt lookin' for things to preach humble to
Devil's waitin' at the gas station plottin' to murder you
That's why I keep my eyes open and my Roscoe in my front pocket
So, if you run I guarantee that you'll get dropped quick
Seasoned veterans [?] hip to all the slickness
Just 'cause I smile, don't think that I'm with that frilly shit
Don't be a statistic, I empty clips quick
Wild cowboy style, I spill your gravy when I bust this biscuit
So, it's best you keep it movin', singin' it while you walk
Even the hardest niggas get outlined in chalk
So, it's best you keep it movin', singin' it while you walk
Even the hardest niggas get outlined in chalk

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's time to bubble up
Phat Kat for Ronnie Euro, I'm on a double up
Gloves off, you suckas better knuckle up
The road was rough, I had to buckle up

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's time to bubble up
Phat Kat for Ronnie Euro, I'm on a double up
Gloves off, you suckas better knuckle up
The road was rough so I had to buckle up

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's time to bubble up
Phat Kat for Ronnie Euro, I'm on a double up
Gloves off, you suckas better knuckle up
The road was rough, I had to buckle up
