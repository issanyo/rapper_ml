[Intro: Bizarre]
Detroit, Motown
Hey, guess what
They gave us a Super Bowl this year
And you know what happened?

[Hook]
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Hennyed up, remied up, ski mask, black truck
Dickie outfit, passenger side (Pistol grippin' punk)
Fuck it I just did two lines
A chrome Tec-9, it'll tear out nigga's spine
It's a party, go on in an have fun
Cause after it's over all you going hear is (RUN, NIGGA, RUN! AHH!!!) *gunshots*
Shooting, blasting, hitting the floor
$10,000 in the safe, shit, I'm about to score
Cause I'm dangerous off angel dust
Shit, I'll bust, even the nigga that came with us
And this is for my niggas that be robbing and stealing
Carjacking, murder one's and fucking drug dealings

[Hook]
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I stumble in the club blowed, 9mm cocked
Something's telling me to stop, fuck it, I don't see the cops
Niggas don't believe it till they see it's out
Stupid motherfuckers want to take the scenic route, now the heater's out
Bitches scream like I pulled my penis out
Begging me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that mink
Come out of them diamonds, and you come out of that valuer
The party is over, shut the fuck down, cut the music
Matter of fact turn it back it up, shit, I can use it
I need the noise, in case I have to let a couple off
Saw another icy chain, walked over and tugged it off
Give me that buttersoft, and since you buying out the bar
You can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow (good looking)
I'm out for the paper, my homie, better hide your jewels
I'm in the game starving and I ain't playing by the rules, nigga

[Hook]
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)

[50 Cent]
