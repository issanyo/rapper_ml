[Intro: Lil' Jon]
Yeah
We had a long way comin'
End of the album
And I think it's time to shut this motherf**ker down

[Verse 1: BME]
I don't wanna know why
But a nigga gotta see ya
With, rhyme and a head with a jab of shed
To f**k nigga bitches with nigga' wit an atitude
Child molester, prosecutor, witness, to erdicator
Deciminator, Terminator

[Verse 2: Lil' Jon]
I bring pain to ya motherf**king name
Insane, super crazy, 619 bitch jay
Sick on a damn of motherf**ker epiomin child
My style's f**k up, delierous, f**k while
The game got switched on some BME shit
Pussies love to suck on some dick
