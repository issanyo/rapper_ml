[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Don't make me have to put your brains right up in a package
My .357 make a nigga do backflips
I can eat your guts and jump in a studio afterwards
Cut 'em up with a knife then eatin' then I go back to work
I'm a animal, a cannibal I live off a human meat
And I chew brains like a cantaloupe
I was walkin' down the avenue bloody like Lurch
I run up in your church and let the heck [?]
I cut them bitches up after that I'm still in a hearse
Put your knife in a neck of the reverend
I'm stealing her purse
And you know I love meat, well...
Now I'm 'bout to have it with my nigga from D12
Now they 'bout to die because of my fuckin' CD sells
Cuttin' off the nuts and turnin' them niggas to females
Then I fuck 'em in the ass with a machete I'm deadly
Leave your intestines on the grass
