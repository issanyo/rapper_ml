[Intro]
I been listening to this whole D12 mixtape, I haven't heard anything about purple pills, cocaine or molly. Come on fellows, get your shit together

[Hook: Bizarre]
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby

[Bridge]
High with us, everybody 'bout to get high with us
High with us, everybody 'bout to get high with us
High with us, everybody 'bout to get high with us
High with us, everybody 'bout to get high with us

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
Whippin' the toilets at parties and I'm down
Covered in vomit guzzling all the Bacardi Brown
And down in the valley where that green grass grow
Where "Under the Influence" be coming on
I'm blow, I know how to party
A spontaneous nigga never knowing how I'm coming
Got 11 blunts rolled and they all in my pocket
My bong is longer than a vacuum in your closet
Invite anybody, your aunt, grandmomma
It doesn't matter she gonna be walking out staggering
I'm crazy as I ever been, Devil's Night 2
Bumping out of your speakers, word to my nigga Don Q
We sorry for the wait, I been chilling overseas
Getting paper in the Netherlands with marijuana tea
Coming back just to slap you in the face with this music
Now back to getting high, shout out to my nigga Whoo Kid

[Hook: Bizarre]
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
Too many bottles, I'm thinking it's time to quit
Waking up at random hotel rooms looking like shit
Strolling through the streets of London, hit the alley, take a piss
(Nigga we are in Ireland) Well ain't that about a bitch (oh well)
Let's see a few bars and get FUBAR'd
I'm thinking niggas see a few stars, I took it too far
A lot of problems I'm having, I'm feeling like I got a earl
False alarm, what's up with your girl, she playin'
(Who are you talking to? What are you saying?)
I'm laying face down having a talk with the pavement
Rave shit [?]
One day I'ma put this bottle down and hang it up
Get it together and stop being a dick hanging with nuts
Until that day comes, I'ma sit here drinking [?]
Walking out my intervention with my middle finger up
Cause I

[Hook: Bizarre]
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby
(Stay high) Smoking, drinking, we be popping pills baby

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
Take a half a [?] then I go to sleep
Woke up to a nasty big booty freak
I'm off the wall, geeked up, man I'm off the chain
Popping pills, getting high, smoking, ah Mary Jane
I'm hyped up, going crazy, niggas know I'm going HAM
High as hell, hotel room, off in Amsterdam
Shower cap out here, fucking all these dirty sluts
Cocaine life, Molly life, I need an intervention, bitch
Lemme toke on your dirty coochie
I'm the new John Belushi, bitch
You're a fucking dirty groupie, bitch
Your ass taste like a bowl of sushi, bitch
