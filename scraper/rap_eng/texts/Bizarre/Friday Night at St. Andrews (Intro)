Yeah yeah
Fuck it
Time to get back in the studio
Live at St. Andrew's
Good! (Bizarre, Bizarro!)
I'm back motherfucker!

[Part 1]

Fuck an introduction
Y'all niggas know my name
I blow up niggas brains
Off an 8th of caine
I bang, but i ain't in no gang
They say bizarre is crazy and deranged
I smoke that weed and cop oc's
More than 3, I probable OD
I take no shower i be in Jacuzzis
Fuck a good girl, Bizarre fuck groupies
Bitch drink this wine, snort this line
Turn around so I can lick your behind
Call Paradime, tell him bring the Guinness
Bottle of vidocin, just seen the dentist
And Im finished ghost and goblins
My teeth grinding, my mouth all sloppy
And Im fucked up
And I can't recall
Friday Night Live at St Andrews Hall

[Part 2]

Stand the fuck up, get your lighter in the air
Wave them around like you just dont care
This is my motherfucking house
From detroit all the way to the south
My lifes a ongoing saga
Them TV awards, tongue-kissing Lady Gaga
Im a bad baby father, dont spend no time (nuh-uh)
Im a horrible rapper, dont write no rhymes
Easy riders, weed vaporisers
Trying to get higher and higher

(Hey Bizarre, stop fucking around start the album man)
