Dirty Dozen

[Verse 1: Kuniva]
I swear on Big Proof I ain't stoppin'
I'm not from the projects but the pistol was poppin'
Before you reach and cock it, it split through your optics
They talk about who really can rock it, who set a few trends
Who killing them shows, I walk in, they switching the topic
My crew is head of the pack, my wall is covered in plaques
Runyon Ave still got my back, my crib flooded with gats
Lyrically I am smack mixed with heroine and crack
See Jesse and Mr. White be selling me by the packs
Schooled by Dr. Dre, yo Marshall done paved the way
Told us if you wanna sail, you gotta go against a wave
That's why I'm known to serve a nigga any given day
When I walk away they talk about what they was finna say
Check 'em and then I tell these little niggas, "Get in line"
They know it all, how you gon' teach the sun how to shine?
Homie this here is mine, I'm hungry I'm on my grind
I'm the last of my kind, I'm bred from '99, and I'm repping

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Platinum plaques, international rap artists give us dap
Then ask when we coming back
We done raised the bar, left a scar on your A&R
We done came too far, freestyling in local bars
To world tours and packin', I'm outrappin' your favorite rapper
Half of these bastards Draculin' my tactics
Had 'em laughin' off of pills, as soon as we signed a deal
These haters thought that we couldn't pull it off, now we did
We back on our bullshit, we spazzin' on 'em again
With gold paper, insulated booth and platinum pen
When I'm writin' I bet lightnin' will strike this mic
I recommend you to pay homage, knocking us is a sin
These rappers are held accountable for doubtin'
The most powerful rhymers that ever dropped an album, we ain't stoppin'
Staying dirty in the cut, our blood's thicker than mud
We ain't gotta prove nothing, these niggas don't give it up
I'm repping the

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
You want positive shit, then listen to Kendrick Lamar
You want crazy shit, then listen to Bizarre
Sick shit, send a thick bitch a dick pic
PornHub, watch me nut quick
I'm crazy, off the chain, I ain't got 'em all
A human cannonball gone off twenty Adderall (Tweaking!)
Buggin' out, me and my niggas always thuggin' out
Hostile situation, man, I ain't comin' out
Power Path, eat you like a Sour Patch
Sixty pounds lighter, no shower cap
Got shooters, dick longer than a ruler
She ain't fucking? Shit I'm calling Uber
D12, seasoned vet, Wu-Tang, protect ya neck
Don't be like Plies and get suplexed, ha ha
This goes out to all of my fans
2016, I'll no longer be a man
Ha ha, shout out to Bruce Jenners, man
