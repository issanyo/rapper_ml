[Intro: Bizarre]
Yeah D12 back up in this bitch
It's the red hair rapist
Stinking ass, Bizzy
Yeah nigga, y'all thought we was gone?
Yeah, I see you Omar hahaha
My nigga Rick Robinson, doing management
Yeah nigga we do smoke crack
We smoke crack in Detroit

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Thirty seconds your ass better start runnin'
Better on the time, if D12 is comin'
When Bizarre grabs the chrome
It breaks through bones, avenging homes, shoot through cellular phone
It's the dirty kid from the Midwest
Come in your club with more hot boys than Mannie Fresh
Now who's the freshest twenty mile
I eat him like Ex-Lax then shit him out
Takin' ecstasy mixed with Hay and Tanqueray
I'm blowing more record deals than Windy Day
I'm eatin' crews like Hannibal Lecter boat
Getting my dick sucked by bisexual transsexual vegetable
Everything Bizarre says is questionable
Sniffing more gas than a fuckin' Texico
Bitch suck my cock while I'm peeing
I'm getting it on with a Jamaican Caldean Korean
Bizarre's a life taker, rush you with the ice breaker
Breakin' niggas back, then call me the back breaker
'Cause you don't want it, especially when I'm blunted
'Cause you'll get stepped on like Keith on 17 hunnid
I'm out cold like Steve Austin
D12 got problems, like cars from the auction
Just step up and get file
If the big fat hair red nigga from seven miles

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the idiotic Bizarre, the idiotic Bizarre
The idiotic Bizarre, the idiotic Bizarre
It's the idiotic Bizarre (C'mon), the idiotic Bizarre (C'mon)
The idiotic Bizarre, the idiotic

[Chorus]
It's just a sample, 'cause D12 is coming
It's just a sample, 'cause D12 is coming
It's just a sample, 'cause D12 is coming
It's just a sample, 'cause D12 is coming

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
Now you know that I'm the loudmouth yes
Nigga that hate silence, breaks tyrant
Encourage the kids to go routes that I went
A bus driver that's nearsighted, I can see your ass
But not people I'm 'posed to pick up from stops, 'cause I ride past them
Who the hell you know jump in the lake of Piranhas
I go to church just to slang god I'm driven off drama
Fuck your momma I'll kill her for stacking shit that high
Your nose got shot 'cause I missed your eye
Wife's gotta get high off his own supply
Zombify your whole family I'll make 'em verify the corpses
Headless horseman that'll leave your stage torchin'
You scream beef but soon as I show y'all niggas forfeit
My beats bang got ears bleeding through Walkmans
That's why people ignoring you like you ain't even talking
You chitchatted and got splattered by a diseased beat addict
That spits spontaneous like brain manners
I cut a nigga quicker than gangrene
The man seem high getting ignant over beats by losing spleen
The truth will be seen, soon as my team get on
We ruin cities like Godzilla did Hong Kong
They mad at me first 'cause a bitch that they brung
Leaving the club with us and hardly ain't got nothing on
She came fully dressed, I've just kicked her out
Glad I told the ugly bitch my name is Steve Stoute

[Chorus]
It's just a sample, 'cause D12 is coming
It's just a sample, 'cause D12 is coming
It's just a sample, 'cause D12 is coming
It's just a sample, 'cause D12 is coming
