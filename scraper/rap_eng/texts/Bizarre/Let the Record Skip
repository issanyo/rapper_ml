I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip

Vile, sick, son of a bitch
Say shit three times in a row like I don't give a shit (bitch! bitch!)
God dammit son of an ass
Ladies and gentlemen, Bizarre's a dumb ass!
Sayin' cus words like too short
Eatin' pork of all sorts in the middle of New York
Beatin' my meat, watchin' Sesame Street
Fuck a sheep, I'll bust in my little niece
She's so sweet, a six year old freak
Wanted me to bust right between her ass cheeks!
You ever met a guy with cancer who refused chemo?
Call a doctor a homo and do a two week promo!
That's me, a fucking G!
I'll probably be dead before the end of this cd!
And VD? I probably caught it
Crack in your neighborhood? I probably brought it!

I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip

Yeah! when this Hennessy get into me
Man I talk shit until I lose my mind like Kennedy!
The bottom line, I ain't feelin' your ass!
So when the pumps fill your car, it ain't to fill it with gas!
(nigga!)
Its Young Miles, I'm the boss of the crime!
You don't know another nigga thats as hard as I
I clap a nigga in his ride then a toss the nine
I'm at your wake with a bomb, now your coffin flyin'!
You tryna say this aint the bestest record?
Man you got it fuck up like sex in heaven!
And I can gun you down, I don't fuck around
I have you sleepin' up underground!
So when your boy load the lead in the pipe
Bitch niggas better run like they scared for they life!
And when I pop the thang
Even the niggas in the crowd catch shots like a hockey game!

I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip

I'm a grown ass man that's an obsessed Usher fan
Gonna rub his back and put on his head band (Usher!)
Mid-twenties, still workin' at Wendy's (May I help you?)
Sniffin' coke with my girlfriend Kemi
Fuck a cup, I'll piss in your butt!
Tell my grandfather shut the fuck up
While I piss in his butt!
Can't be around kids, my brains is splattered
I ain't readin' books, I'm fillin' on pampers
Bizarre don't give a shit, fucking a bitch eighty-six
(He just told you he don't give a shit!)
My grandmother eighty-six and my grandfather would nut in his butt
I'm a god damn nut!
