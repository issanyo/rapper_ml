[Verse 1]
Knock-knock, who the fuck is it?
It's Mr. Boogeyman came to pay you a visit
Known pedophile, the dude from the Green Mile
And I don't give a fuck about killing no child
I'm Wild Bill
With an urge to kill
Shut the fuck up 'fore I fill this still
Lock the door, run in the house
Matter fact, don't come out
Fuck old ladies, I'm after little babies
Sick of rabbits, I think I got rabies
I'm Peter Piper, a known fighter
Fuck a cypher, I'm trying to change a diaper
There's something about a newborn that turns me on
I'm lonely, I need to keep goin'
Baby crying, I think she need her mother
'Bout to burn her ass cheeks with hot butter

[Hook]
I'm a boogeyman, I'm a boogeyman
I love the babies, I hate the kids
I love the babies, I hate the kids
I'm a boogeyman, I'm a boogeyman
Boogey

[Verse 2]
25 seconds, it's 'bout to be a slaughter
Bizarre's about to potty train your daughter
Look at those Huggies, nice and comfy
Keep safe, bitch, give me all the money
(Laughs) Bitch, ain't nobody laughing
What the fuck you think is about to happen
This is about to happen, I'm 'bout to rape Johnny
And turn around and do the same to his mommy
Matter of fact, I'mma let Johnny hide
Chicken noodle soup with a dick on the side
Johnny roast up and grabbed his weapon
And say he don't want to be treated like that girl named Precious
It's no reception, phone out of order
That's what she yell to her daughter
I'm fucked up, I made the wrong decisions
Fuck it, I'll get buttfucked in prison

[Hook](2X)
