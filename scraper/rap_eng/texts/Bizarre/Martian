She just wanna live with the martian
She just wanna live with the martian
She love the way that we party, smokin' and drink till' the morning
She been upset with her husband, she said she might just divorce em'
Cuz she just wanna live with the martian, she just wanna live with the martian, whoo!
She just wanna live with the martian

She love the way that we party, smokin' and drink till' the morning
She been upset with her husband, she said she might just divorce em'

[Verse 1: Illest Rated]
I just gotta get it, mind is on my business
Grinding till' I finish, flying like Lieutenants
Fighting like I'm just Popeye up on the spinach
Sirens cry, 5 just be riding for your sentence
Eye up on that prism, trying to make a million
Tired of this living, tired of being broke and locked down
Reading fucking writing on the ceiling
Up in my spaceship, flying over ceilings
Puffin' amazin' you know I'm rollin' killa
Feelin' Super Sayian, pussy just like Krillin
Pop it like the villian, god up in this building
Hotter then Giza, stand strong like pyramids of Egypt
Make ya girl drop down to her knees, ya
Cuz she just want a Martian, Martian, Martian, Martian, whoo!
I don't know what happened, I just felt the magic
Hop up out the casket, now I'm back in action
Feeling like I'm Pocahontas I'm a savage
Feeling like I'm smoking hard up on the cabbage
High up in my spaceship, I am on my planet
Risin' thru the patterns, flying up to Saturn
Higher understandin', diving to Atlantis

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I'm outer space, I'm out of mind, I'm traveling and babbling
In tattling and saddling, brain just keeps on rattling
I'm on some rude shit, some smooth shit
Let me suck your boob bitch, better move bitch
Or get Hoovered, bout to suck this rude dick
Perkasets I'm oping, Molly, I'm floating
I'm choking and smoking, why are you provoking?
This killa from 7 Mile, known to get get very wild
Versatile, versatile, smoking on a black and mild
Overdosing (whoo!), butts in motion(whoo!)
Atlantic ocean (whoo!) , what you smokin'?
It got me open, magic potion
What you smokin? That new Frank Ocean (hahaha)

[Verse 3: Teck]
She just wanna live with the Martian, fuck the world get abortion
Go ape shit like Tarzan, Jake sick like poison
Like game 6 I'm winning, young niggas on Twinning
I'm Barry Bonds every inning, young nigga just beginning
Pop the clip and shoot to kill, a Ruthless Villian
Rest in peace Eazy-E
I got cop suspicion, stop the snitchin'
Why these bitches always worried bout me?
Yeah, I'm trippin' out, hit the spot
Shoutin' out, 7th Ward hold your pistols out
Missed the drought, made it rain on the pussy
She was good looking and her tits was out
I'm flipping out like gymnastics, she a freak hoe
I'm a sick bastard, she a free throw and I been splashin'
Been blastin' like Bin Laden, I been grabbin that bomb weed
My front lawn got palm trees, in Gulf Breeze
I'm off these, get so drunk lose car keys like whoo!
