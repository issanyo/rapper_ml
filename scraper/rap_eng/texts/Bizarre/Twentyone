Intro [Bizarre]

Yeeaahhh…

Enter my world

Pill God

Pill God

Whoah…

Somewhere in outer space

Chorus

Throw back another pill to cap off the night (whoah)
Twenty-one and I need the ice (somewhere in outer space)
Like I need a lullaby (whoah, whoah)
Throw back another pill to cap off the night (whoah)
Twenty-one and I need the ice (somewhere in outer space)
Like I need a lullaby (I’m drowning)

Verse I (Sinopsys)

Just copped me some Oxies, four for one
I pop three then fall asleep in the Florida sun
Nonstop soft, sweet dreams ‘til the morning come
Groggily on the beach, recall and reorder ‘em
Visions as vivid as visits from apparitions
It’s mystic, it’s fact, it’s fiction, or is it my past arisen?
From the ashes, driven back to Christmas ‘96 when dad was livin’
Splashin’, swimmin’, laughin’ in the grass and Tallahassee fishin’
Sit up and sigh as the sky undulates
Orange and gray runs of paint state the suns awake
I stand up and shake … the sleep off of my back
I wish there was a way to keep those dreams in tact
But there isn’t. And the memories keep lessening with time
And it’s messing with my mind, wish I could just press rewind
But I can’t. I can slip off into the blue--
That prescripted blissful pool where existence is crystal cool
So, I slip my fist into that backpack and grab the bottle
Split my last pill in half like a fuckin’ avocado
Crush it up until it’s all snow, then swallow with my nostril
Then I fall into the numbness and wallow in the hollows

Chorus

Throw back another pill to cap off the night (whoah)
Twenty-one and I need the ice (somewhere in outer space)
Like I need a lullaby (whoah, whoah)
Throw back another pill to cap off the night (whoah)
Twenty-one and I need the ice (somewhere in outer space)
Like I need a lullaby (I’m drowning)

Verse II (Bizarre)

Pill God, heal not, trippin’ off of shit (yeah)
Higher than the sky, higher than a (“He-he!”)
I see stars (yeah), I see bars (huh?)
I see cars (yeah), I see Mars (Maaarrss)
Seesaw, I can’t see at all (can’t see at all)
Goin’ through withdrawals like Total Recall  (Uuucchh!)
Since birth, I been on Planet Percs (yeah)
It’s a cycle, watch me leave earth (woohoo!)
I’m dreamin’ (dreamin’), I see demons
Am I in Cleveland? Am I just dreamin? (dreamin’)
30s and 40s; I love 80s
10s are my friends, I’m going crazy (crazy!) This is...
This is out of control (yeah!)
And the devil, he want my soul (he want it)
I hate him (I hate him), fuck Kratom (fuck Kratom!)
Ten percocets, I ate ‘em
I ate ‘em (Muahahahaha)

Chorus

Throw back another pill to cap off the night (whoah)
Twenty-one and I need the ice (somewhere in outer space)
Like I need a lullaby (whoah, whoah)
Throw back another pill to cap off the night (whoah)
Twenty-one and I need the ice (somewhere in outer space)
Like I need a lullaby (I’m drowning)

Verse III (Sinopsys)

All day long I been gobblin’ Klonopin
Off and on again til’ the pill bottles hollowin’
Get up to walk and then I’m wobblin’, can’t talk my head is bobblin’
Keep my feelings hidden like the cave that Osama’s in
I demand checks, can’t rest without my Xanax
I get damn stressed, then I stand next to the counter
And I pay them, cram ten in my face when
I’m in my basement, if I don’t taste them then I’m shakin’
My satchel pack’s filled with capsules of Paxils
My room is like a war zone, stacked with prescripted shrapnel
Sleep is hard to come by, and that’s why
It’s handy when I got a handful of Ambien, take five
Wash ‘em down with some Brandy then I’m feelin’ dandy and
I can finally doze off to Candyland
Wake up in the morning, not feelin’ mad at all
Cuz I got a cabinet full of Adderall to make me stand up tall
I medicate to set my fate to a better state
To irradicate and bring a fall to my brain’s padded walls
And that is all I know how to cope with
I pop a pill and hope gets a little less hopeless

Chorus

Throw back another pill to cap off the night (whoah)
Twenty-one and I need the ice (somewhere in outer space)
Like I need a lullaby (whoah, whoah)
Throw back another pill to cap off the night (whoah)
Twenty-one and I need the ice (somewhere in outer space)
Like I need a lullaby (I’m drowning)
