[INTRO]
Fuckin do this..
{crash}
Fuck it!

[Verse 1:]
"Susan! Make sure the door's locked!"
Too late, bitch, I done pulled the fuckin Glock
Hit you in the face with a mop and tied you up with socks
"Dial 9-1-1!"
Bitch, I am a fuckin cop!
I'm not a cop, I'm a fuckin' lieutenant
For the last two months, I been suspended
Suspended, cause I love to shoot
Male prostitutes
I love to catch them walkin down Santa Monica Boulevard
Put a nine to them, catch em off guard
Any time of the day, I walk up to them and steal em
God hate fags, sent me here to kill em
Don't reach for the phone, don't call for help
I know you hate me, I fuckin hate myself
I need someone to talk to, I'm glad you listen
Cause ten minutes from now
I'll be in prison

[Hook:]
I need, someone, to listen to meee...
(I'm fucking crazy)
I need, someone, who cares about meee...
(my wife is a slut)
I need, a friend, I need, a friend
I need, a friend, I need, a friend

[Verse 2:]
"Aaaah!" Shut up, bitch, before I shoot you
This fuckin' nine will fuckin' execute you
You're probably wonderin' why I'm in your house
It's a long story, just help me out
See, the story is that I'm a rapper that's tryna make it
Now I'm a rapist, that's tryna take it
You like my chain? Bitch, don't break it
My mother gave it to me, it's kinda sacred
I used to be a Catholic priest, now I'm livin' on the streets
Wanted for touchin' my little niece
It Started off, with my niece kissin' me
W-where the fuck you goin', bitch? Listen to me
And please believe she started with me first
I didn't know she was a virgin and her booty hole would hurt
Stop starin' at the phone, you can't make a call
I got your ass cheeks, nailed to the wall
And I'm finally glad that the truth came out
This is the part where it ends, I blow my brains out {gun fires}

[Hook]
