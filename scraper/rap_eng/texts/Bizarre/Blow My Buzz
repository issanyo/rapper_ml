[Intro: Swifty McVay]
Hmm, yeah
This just one of them days when yo' ass just wanna chill out
And motherfuckers be all in yo' ear and shit, yknowhatI'msayin?
Or that nagging bitch, that just like to hear herself talk
Blowing all yo' high away
Now that's some fucked up shit, heh
But it happens, yknowhatI'msayin? Yo

[Eminem]
Yo yo yo yo
Schizophrenia, how many of ya got it?
How many motherfuckers can say they psychotic?
How many motherfuckers can say they brain dry-rotted from pot?
You got it like I got it or not?
If you did, you would know just what I'm talking bout
When your tongue's rotting out from cotton-mouth
When you end up becoming so dependent on weed
That you end up spending a G in the vending machine
You got the munchies, look at you, junk food junkie
Potato chips and lunch meat, up in the front seat
Sometimes you can get so paranoid from ganja
That's it gotcha thinking the whole world is watching ya
Or maybe you don't smoke, maybe you just roll
But whatever your drug's yo, go for the gusto
Just don't, come fuck with me when I'm doing my drugs
You see me in the club don't come fucking my high up and

[Hook: Eminem/Kon Artis]
Blow, my, buzz
Do what you want to just don't blow, my, buzz
(Do what you want to) And I'm gon' sit here and just roll, my, drugs
(Smoke my weeeeed) And if you talk I'm gonna fuck, you, up
(I might just whoop yo' ass) Just don't say shit and we'll be cool

[Bizarre]
{*ding dong*} Bitch let me in the house (Avon?)
No, I just came to eat your mother out
It's the big guy, doing a butterfly to the ground (go 'head!)
[Eminem]
Bizarre sit yo' nasty ass down!
[Bizarre]
I spot this fat bitch from across the room
Now suck my dick while your boyfriend's in the bathroom (yea yea!)
My face is pink, looking for a sink
And don't worry bout what I put in your drink
It's called a date-rape drug, ten minutes you'll be fucked up
Open your nasty-ass legs up (yeah you whore)
Bitches I'm catching, blunts I'm matching
Don't call me Bizarre, I'm the Reverend Jesse Jackson

[Swift]
Who the fuck is this guy, why the hell you in my presence?
It'd be cool if you was asking me some reasonable questions
But you on some bullshit nigga, this yo' last beer (f'real)
Get the fuck off my dick and tell yo' bitch to bring here ass here
I kick a ho out without giving her cabfare
And leave her barefooted just for nagging in my damn ear
When I'm out eating, you fags'll interfere
They don't go until I let 'em know a mag' is sitting here
I get drunk and I smoke weed, whatcho' ass wanna hear?
I didn't answer you clear, I met Manson this year okay?
You want some yay? I'll front yo' ass a play
But other than that, get the hell out my face
Because you niggas trying to

[Hook 2: Kon Artis] (adlibbing)
Blow, my, buzz (heeeeeeey)
Do what you want to just don't blow, my, buzz
(I'm gonna sit here) And I'm gon' sit here and just roll, my, drugs
(hmmmmmm) And if you talk I'm gonna fuck, you, up
(Shut yo' damn mouth!) Just don't say shit and we'll be cool

[Kuniva and Kon Artis]
[Kuniva] Yo, Denaun you seem shook
[Kon Artis] I really am dawg - look!
This fat bitch keep chasing me trying to give me the nook
[Kuniva] Aww, man you probably lead her on
[Kon Artis] I just bought her a beer!
[Kuniva] I saw her rubbing on your head while she was wiping your tears
[Kon Artis] I admit, I was high, but you ain't seen me crying
[Kuniva] Nigga, you lying, and you blowing my high, just stop denying it
[Kon Artis] Well at least somebody in this bar is, this big bitch did
The ultimate by saying she wanted to have my kids
[Kuniva] Look man you grown, just leave me alone, I'm in the zone
Call it a night, get stoned, and take that fat slut home
Just drink the drink, hit the dank, do some drugs
Go kill yourself
[Kon Artis] Fuck you!
[Kuniva] Well, stop blowing my buzz!

[Proof]
I'm at the front of the bar by the lounge in the back
With a slut on my arm while I'm downing the 'gnac
Got the pills in my system, floating around
Every time I start drifting, someone open they mouth
Yo my ear been spit licked and freestyled in
I think I'm going def like most senile men
Only one good demo out of three thousand
(Yo I ain't wanna rap for you anyway) A'ight, peace out then!
Next nigga that bump me, I'mma do the Humpty
And elbow bitches, 'til everybody jump me

(Yo man whassup wit you man why you keep bumpin me and shit)
Whassup fool? Fuck you punk!
(Motherfucker, the fuck? It's on fool it's on! Whassup then nigga?)

[Hook 3: Kon Artis] (adlibbing)
Blow, my, buzz (heeeeeeeeeeey)
Do what you want to just don't blow, my, buzz
(Do what you want to) And I'm gon' sit here and just roll, my, drugs
(Smokin', Rollin', on and On...) And if you talk I'm gonna fuck, you, up
(Slap the shit out you!!) Just don't say shit and we'll be cool

[Outro: Kon Artis]
We'll be cool
We'll be cool if you don't talk while I'm just trying to smoke my weed
Smoke my weed
I'm trying to drink with my niggas; just shut the fuck up
While I'm just trying to get blowed
Spitting to me some mo'.. (hehehe)
