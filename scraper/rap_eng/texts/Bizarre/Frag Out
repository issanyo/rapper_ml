[Verse 1: Mike ADHD]
Ayo they issued me a hand grenade, you should've seen the mess it made
When I blow up in your face, your blood is up all over the place
I go into a blind rage [?] stage
You alone in my own zone when I'm on the microphone
[?] to hold your own [?]
It's sad but true but that's what I'ma do to you
Turn your stage set into ECW
You ain't smart, get locked up committing robbery
Ain't no back up plan, man you executed it sloppily
Most of my friends end up in a cemetery
My friends and family don't know what's gotten into me
Quite deadly, sideways [?]
You can't even hold the pistol steady
I hope you're prepared
I'm insane, I start ripping out all of my hair
I'm not threatened by your stare, I won't quit until the smell [?]
In the air, realize that I don't care

[Hook: Mike ADHD]
Turn up the volume, get mad loud
Give me the mic and hear me shout
You'll be screaming "Man down"
Move out the way when we frag out
Turn up the volume, get mad loud
Give me the mic and hear me shout
You'll be screaming "Man down"
Move out the way when we frag out

[Verse 2: Sid Wilson]

[Hook: Mike ADHD]
Turn up the volume, get mad loud
Give me the mic and hear me shout
You'll be screaming "Man down"
Move out the way when we frag out
Turn up the volume, get mad loud
Give me the mic and hear me shout
You'll be screaming "Man down"
Move out the way when we frag out

[Verse 3: Baby Eazy-E]
I'm in the streets creep creeping with the heat
My name's E3 and I'm the beast of the east
See me is something that you'll never see
I am what I am and it is what it seems
Looking at niggas [?]
A white t into a red t, I'm leaving you wet
Talk shit motherfucker, something you will regret
Don't fuck with E3 [?] that's on the set
Outside [?] motherfuckers [?]
[?] motherfuckers like nah I don't bang
I'm about making dollars and you all about change
An infrared to your head, I blow out your brain
Some niggas [?]
Cause if I ever fell in the streets, E3 taught himself just to get up
Stand tall motherfucker when I'm talking sit up
Or watch how your head and your body gon' split up

[Hook: Mike ADHD]
Turn up the volume, get mad loud
Give me the mic and hear me shout
You'll be screaming "Man down"
Move out the way when we frag out
Turn up the volume, get mad loud
Give me the mic and hear me shout
You'll be screaming "Man down"
Move out the way when we frag out
