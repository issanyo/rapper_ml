[Intro: DJ Young Mase]
Yeah, I want to thank y'all for coming out
This is the last song from the Return of The Dozen, part 2
Y'all haven't heard D12 in a while
So we gonna give you what you being asking for

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Straight out the Halfway House, they let this bastard out
Check all the doors; there's no way to get out
I'm far from a pussy, I'm more like a dick
I'm the pain in your stomach when you're about to take a shit
Shit, bitch suck everybody dick
Patch on my eye: I'm the new Slick Rick
And my boys, we'll call 'em Doug E. Fresh
All this period blood; clean up all this mess
If I don't get my record on Shade-45
I'm going in the building and make sure everybody dies
Shoot Rude Jude, blast Lord Sear
Shoot Howard Stern and he don't even work there
Bizarre gets high, everybody dies
Even the nigga who drove in the drive-by is gonna die
Me and Goofy Gary raping Halle Berry
Say 'Bizarre' ten times like Bloody Mary

[Verse 2: Swift]
I'm a Grenade aimer, applying heat like radiators
I detonate a concoction; you won't play possum
I snatch that oxygen out you're biological time-clock
With one shot between your eyes, now you're a cyclops
I'm lyrically retarded; I turn your apartment into an icebox
With a pipe-bomb taped to your hot-top
I smithereens 'em
I use my fingers the same fashion as Wolverine
Go with a pistol, Gilbert Arenas
If I say it, I mean it. I feed you slugs
And have you throwing up blood like a bulimic
Because of me a lot of people died
Be scared that I will be outside
Starring through the window like a peeping tom
With the mind of a Vietnam Vet injected needles in my neck
With a high, I still haven't came down yet
I'm not a threat, I'm a promise
I'm as, crazy as Osama slash Unabomber
Shoot the llama through your momma! (Bitch)

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I take my time with the skill that I utilize
Ill commit suicide
Succeed then do it twice
Whatever happen on gettin' your shoes, coat and hat tooken?
Cheese an pretzel combo
Super-sizing an ass whoopin'
I'm too cool but I acted out in a violent manner
When I am Adam, leave everything but its heimlich shattered
Who dares to hurt me?
I'm posted outside 7-Eleven sharin' slurpies with a known whore flarin' Herpes
Lyrical God-king like Xerxes
Who's hooks bleeds tongue sharp
I spit in the forests, and split the earth's trees
You blood pirate I got hatred to get off me chest
An ounce of weed, a 40oz of Milwaukee's best
I take the rage of the niggas who have faiths
And you don't want a test like you afraid that you have AIDS
That bullets have you losing weight like anorexics do
This ain't a DMX flick when you see the exit wounds

[Verse 4: Fuzz Scoota]
.22 is a sheepskin, .38 is a furry
Niggas are pussying me outI can tell the way that it burns
You like cock you female, I can say that you heard
D12's always a suspect when some shady occur
Open pill bottles, guns with their safety's broken
Duncan Heines' nephew giveaway guns when the bakery is open
Pistol smack your bitch, kiss your shortie
Ditch the 40 than chain smoke some piff with Gordy
Different shorties whose bitches like a change of clothes
Cuz house got a driveway and I need them flames to go
Back the fuck up like you've never seen goons
My sixteens is grown up, bitch will be seventeen soon
She got a fucked up attitude and she mean in a way
Your team in the way she on Facebook cleanin the keg
And she's a 20 til you wanna be chanche
Now niggas on Facebook requesting that they wanna be friends

[Outro: DJ Young Mase]
Thank you for having us
D12, Return of the Dozen Volume 2, It's a wrap
