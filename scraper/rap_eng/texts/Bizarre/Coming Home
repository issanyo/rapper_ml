Daddy's really comin' home, just hold tight
I just don't know how long I'll be gone this time
Just keep my picture on the wall, baby girl don't cry
Cause I don't know when I'll be home

[Bizarre]
Ever since I was young (Yeah), it's been my dream (What)
To be successful, doin' this music thing
Music is a part of my soul
I'll be sixty years old, still on the road
A grown ass man tryin' to make a living
A grown ass man makin' grown man decisions (What)
Relax; I don't want you to work
Let me go out here and put in the dirt
I'll buy you a skirt, brand new Coach purse
Whenever I leave, I know it still hurt (Damn!)
What, you want a watch, a bracelet, or a chain?
How about my chest? A tattoo of your name (Deedee)
Man, I'm sick of all this luggage that I'm rattling
Trust me I'm sick of fights and all this traveling (Fuck it!)
Two weeks in the UK, three days in Hong Kong
It won't be long, I'll be home

Look, your daddy has to hit the road
And I know you're getting old enough to notice that I'm gone
And I know I'm your best friend, the one that you look up to
Some people think I'm overprotective, but I just love you
And even though I'm gone, I'd rather be home with you
And no matter where I'm at your daddy is goin' miss you
You're my little man so be nice to your baby sister
And give mommy a big hug for daddy and kiss her
Cause I know she gets tired at times I feel guilty
I wish that I could take y'all wit me
But it's crazy out here and I don't wanna expose you
To the frustrations of this rap game that I go through
And honestly, I don't even do it for me
I do it so we could live life comfortably
And that's why I wear y'all proudly around my neck
And I don't care who last said it, daddy has your respect
And just know that...

(Beep beep!)
Man, here come the van
I wanna thank Mathew Knowles for giving me a chance
Got the advance now it's time to hit the streets
And I'll be home in three and a half weeks
What college you goin' to? That's your decision
Just know that I'll be here to pay your tuition
The only daddy you know, and that's on the real
And I been takin care of you since Murray Ill
I moved down south, big old house
Got you two horses and a lake full of trout
And Sundays, I put on my new house shoes
Lookin at TV, watchin' the Lions lose
I miss Papi, Pug, Pepper and Patches
Man, I can't go to sleep on that brand new mattress
And even though, I mix music in the band
Big Boi and Dave, see you at Lake Ann
