[Intro: Eminem]
(Kill, kill, kill)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, duh-da-da-da-da
(Kill, kill, kill)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, dumm...
(Kill, kill, kill)

[Hook: Eminem]
Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (He's)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this

[Hook: Eminem]
Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (He's)

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwing up in the urinal
(You fucking homo!) That's what I said at my dad's funeral

[Hook: Eminem]
Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (He's)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fucking idiots still
That's why the first mothafucka popping some shit he gets killed
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville
You can get capped after just having a cavity filled (hahahaha!)
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfucking Hamburger Hill
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fuckin shoot it out with 'em too
That's the mentality here, that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they want to challenge me here?
While I'm holding a pistol with this many calibers here?
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year?
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen, when a thousand bullets come at your house and collapse the foundation around you
And they found you and your family in it
GOD DAMMIT HE MEANT IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU

[Hook: Eminem]
Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (He's)
