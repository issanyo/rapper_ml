[Hook: Eminem]
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

[Verse 1: Eminem]
The rage I release on a page
Is like a demon unleashin' a caged
Lunatic as soon as I hit the stage
My mind is like a fuckin' stick of dynamite
Once I get behind the mic
It's like the wick is lit, you bitches die tonight
My 9 is like a guidin' light at night: shinin' bright
My fuckin' grip is tighter than my wife's vagina (psych!)
These cock-suckin' cops got my Smith-N-Wesson
I guess it's time to pick a different weapon
Man, the shit's depressin'
But Swift is gettin' me a new one for a Christmas present
Come on, Slim, let's go and teach this fuckin' bitch a lesson!
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
Shady, stay creative, baby
Hold your head up, don't you let up
One bit on these motherfuckin' suckers
You're a soldier, get up!
Stand up for what you believe in, long as you breathin'
They jealous of you, man, that's the only reason they beefin'

[Hook: Eminem]
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
It's that Dirty Dozen renegade
You done pulled the pin out my grenade
.38's will move your shit up out the way
You niggas won't forget about McVay
You got somethin' to say?
Let it out today, or watch these bullets spray
From these 10 black fingers huggin' these deadly millimeters
That'll make Jeff Dahmer look like he caught a misdemeanor
See, I'm Dirty, so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater
You gets whipped with it
Tell them motherfuckers Swift did it
You packin' somethin' special in your crib, then bitch, get it!
I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile
With this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils
You get splitted, and guess what: I'm blowin' up the hospital
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a ho
I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector
Findin whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em

[Hook: Eminem]
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
I'm eatin crews like I'm Hannibal
There's no way I can be the gay rapper (Why not?)
I only fuck animals (Oh! Ha ha)
Stupid trick got my dick startin' to itch
Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch
One on one in this bloodsport
I'm in divorce court, sold my bitch off a pack of Newports
(Your honor!) Six times I been arrested
How would you feel, if you was a Jehovah witness
That always got molested? (It happens)
I'm smokin' dank, drinkin' drank
I can't have any kids 'cause I'm fuckin' shootin' blanks
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck?!
Nicole's a whore, I'm glad O.J. murdered the slut (uhh!)
Responsibility â€“ I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a fag, should be stabbed
Let Richard Simmons be the President (ohh HEYY!!)
Call me a weirdo, call me Bi-zarre
While I stick it up yo' ass while you shittin' diarrhea

[Hook: Eminem]
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons

My words are like weaponry on a record
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons
I never show no emotion
