[Hook] (2x)

Oh Nicki, you so fine
Oh Nicki, you so fine you blow my mind
Hey Nicki!
Hey Nicki!

[Verse 1]
Jamaican, Queens, about to catch a flight
I'll be there... 6 o'clock tomorrow night
Jump off the flight, hit the hotel
Jump in the shower, I'm musty as hell

Unload my bags, pull out the doser
Jackin' off, to this Nicki Minaj poster
Thinking about her, all on the highway
'Fore I bust a nut, I yell "pink friday"

Oh my god, she's so fuckin' sexy
She's not a Barbie, she's more like a Becky
Everyday, I think about what she's wearin'
When the TV come on, I can't stop starin'

You from Trinidad? So is my dad
I'm lying, he's a fag that got shot in Baghdad
How 'bout I pull on a pink wig, how 'bout you wear a shower cap
How 'bout I stab you six hours while you take a fuckin' nap?

Chorus (2x)

[Verse 2]
(My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I do know you, baby, maybe, cause I follow you on Twit-Twit-Twit-Twit-Twitter...
And Facebook [yeah], and Myspace [fuck yeah] and Youtube [what], and Pink Friday)

Hey Onika, it's nice to meet you
I wanna invite you to a, dollar slice a pizza
Put our trunks on, and dive in a pool
How 'bout we have lunch at, Blackwell middle school

It's the end of the world, it's almost armageddon
If you and Drake get married, I'm fuckin' up the weddin'
Knockin' over tables, spittin' food
Kuniva, make sure J-Cole's don't make a move

I'm obsessed with you, Nick, I'm just like Stan
I wanna be you girlfriend, and your best friend
And I heard about your daddy, tryna blow up the house
Next time I see him, I'mma blow out his mouth

And tell Jacob, to take off that makeup
And matter a fact, you and Lil' Kim should make up
I'mma say one more thing before I leave...
Remember, "I will eat your pussy for life... for life... for life"
