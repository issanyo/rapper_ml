***INCOMPLETE***

[Intro]
Turn my mic up
And my headphones down
Finna get nasty
Bizarre kid is back nigga

[Verse 1]
Look who just jump out off the shower
Hundred miles an hour
Smoking sour
Sniffin nothing but white powder
Lee Harvey Oswald, big dog, big ball
One phone call
Kill all of you
It's Mike Jack in Thrilla
Me and (?) bunch of gorillas
Mess with a man and Godzilla
OD'ing, MC’em, call when I’m peein'
Half white, half korean
Me I’m unstoppable
Mission impossible
Stopping BIZARRE?
I dont' think is logical
It's King Kong with a Big Ding Dong
Look what we are
Who wanna get peed on
This ain't Trey Songz
This ain't no love song
Living like ...
...
Big day
It's the blue and white caddy
Like I live in Cincinnati
You don’t want no beef
You just wanna get by like Talib Kweli
Fuck the beef!

[Hook:](Repeat X2)
Here we go, Here we go, Here we go
Here we go, Here we go, Here we go
Cause I’m off the chain now (off the chain now)
Off the chain now!

[Verse 2]
Bizarre
I’m tired to hear you rapping about money
I’m tired to hear you trying to make jokes and be funny
I’m tired to hear you trying to act like a dog
We don’t give a fuck about Celebrity Fitclub
I don’t need ta
Pass the reefer
Pretty mamasita
Say she need a visa
Shack house, second house on the left
And I don't need bread, to bring in that milk
So tough, like Jermaine Dupri
What I take I see
...
Born in the D
313 don’t be cookin' let them D Boys keep spittin;
Freestyle ...
Sweat like a kitten (meow)
Stuck on the toilet
You can’t stop shitting
We haven't stopped splittin'
No fly zone
Is forbidden
Detroit

[Hook:](Repeat X2)

[Verse 3]
Bizarre, sit back then cock and blast
And I don't need Dame to put your brains in the dash
Stop ...
Get some help (HELP!)
Baby boy I’ll beat your ass with a belt
Catch two in your tummy, think is funny
You’ll catch hot lava this ain't Stretch Money
Never bug me I left them all
Big and tall ...
I'm so sick that I need a hog
This Bizarre,  Stop ...
I’ll call my dog they’ll …
You're goldfish, nigga I'm dog
This too raw, Leatherface Texas Chainsaw
27 above the law
Bleek, without Jamal
..

[Hook:](Repeat X2)
