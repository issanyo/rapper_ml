[Intro]
I ain't shit
I ain't even go to college
Matter of fact I ain't even think about goin' to college
If I wasn't be doin' this music shit
I don't what the fuck I'd be doin'

[Verse 1- Bizarre]
Ever since I was seven, I wanted to be a rap artist
Ten years later, I'm still out here starvin'
Started off talent shows, battles around the block
To bein' in the house, 'round six o'clock
Rappin', nigga you better get a job
Stop stayin' in the house, lookin' like a fat slob
And mama, I'm serious about this rappin'
She thought at the snap of a finger, it would all happen
Didn't think about school, homework I left
Report card, came home with all F's
I saw Redman, walked up to him and bust a rap
He said I was sweet and gave me a lil daps
Couple hours, he'll give my phone a tap
I sit there, waited, he never called me back
I didn't take a shower, I waited for six hours
Where the fuck is Reggie Noble?!

[Hook - Bizarre]
You get one shot, only get one shot to take it
You get one chance, only get
One chance to make it
You get one choice, only get one choice to break it
Be a man, be a man nigga
You get one shot, only get one shot to take it
You get one chance, only get
One chance to make it
You get one choice, only get one choice to break it
Be a man, be a man nigga

[Verse 2- Bizarre]
18 years old, mom threw me out the house
Responsibility, am I a man or a mouse
I'm starvin', tryna get a nine to five
And I'll do anything just to survive
I wanna go to Open Mic, but I gotta work tonight
Plus I can't pull up to the club, in a yellow dirt bike (where that nigga bike?)
My girlfriend's pregnant, I think she's havin' a boy
I gotta get two jobs
Gotta buy him some toys
Plus my rap partner say he quit, he's goin' to church
After 5 years of puttin' in work

[Hook - Bizarre]
You get one shot, only get one shot to take it
You get one chance, only get
One chance to make it
You get one choice, only get one choice to break it
Be a man, be a man nigga
You get one shot, only get one shot to take it
You get one chance, only get
One chance to make it
You get one choice, only get one choice to break it
Be a man, be a man nigga

[Verse 3- Bizarre]
I notice my goals is gettin' further away
Chrysler plant, they gave me a call back today
Sixteen hour shift, leaves me a whip
Beeper on my hip, money starts to flip
Been six months, ain't no Hip Hop in here
My stomach gettin' fat from drinkin' all them beers
All I do is watch football and beat my wife
Goddamnit what a hell of a life
My wife ain't cheatin', I know she ain't cheatin'
But every once in awhile she deserves a fuckin' beatin'
My group havin' a meetin' about tryna reunite
But I won't be there cause I
Gotta fuckin' work tonight
And I keep on cryin', just bout to lose it
Its been 2 years since I been away
From music
The best MC from Detroit, nigga I was the man
Don't be like me and blow your chance

[Hook - Bizarre]
You get one shot, only get one shot to take it
You get one chance, only get
One chance to make it
You get one choice, only get one choice to break it
Be a man, be a man nigga
You get one shot, only get one shot to take it
You get one chance, only get
One chance to make it
You get one choice, only get one choice to break it
Be a man, be a man nigga
