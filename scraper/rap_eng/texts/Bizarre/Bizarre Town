[Intro]
Yo Bizarre..
(Yup)
I'm gonna need you to help me fill in some parts here
(You know it!)

[Downtown Verse]
Lord please forgive me
I've been living in the trenches
Bars after bars made you think it's life sentence
Let's end this, demented
I've been working on my next hit
Held my Dad's hand with the death grip
He hopped on the next ship before he made his exit
The regs in, ingest it
Better than a res hit
Got a couple haters round me like a skeptic
That's why I never trust a friendship
I wanna get this, I wanna get whips
And rep shit before we're dead bitch
Light on my feet but it thunders when I walk
Lay your body down that's a hundred for the chalk
This is just an EP but the summers gettin' tossed
When the sun goes down, your daughter goes down
Now it's outta order they like hold up, slow down
I'm like nah, I've been ready I just wanna throw rounds
I wanna show up to show down
(Why?) To show off in the ghost town that y'all round
(Oh) Literally I wrote this shit in under five minutes
Defying all your rules and everything the sky limits

[Bizarre Verse]
Blowing marijuana, I'm blowing these trees
Ain't nobody out here higher than me
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
I'm from the D, They ain't fucking with me
I got this weed, I got these pills
And where I'm from niggas get they ass killed
I'll take your shoes, I'll take your chain
And you ain't gon do a motherfuckin' thing
I don't hype niggas, I fight niggas
Scratch your CD, rewrite niggas
No games put the nine to your grill
But I'd rather smoke some weed and chill
Hahaha, But I'd rather smoke some weed and chill

[Downtown Verse]
Shit is gettin' spooky now I gun at you with uzis
Gettin' finer with my age call me Ichiro Suzuki
I seen your chick in the jacuzzi
Then I made her mine in two weeks
When I told her that you're too weak
Then I ate her like a foodie
Pardon me I took your cutie
I tore it up just like some loose leaf
But fuck that
I'm bout to leave hell, with D12
You need help, so please tell
These females, I seek wealth
Me & Biz when we dwell
We throw em off a purple hill
Where he fell like be well
Cause I remember when you dropped Devil's Night
And dishevled lives, that's when I saw I need a pen to write
That's when I knew that I was meant to strike
And end a life everynight
Until I modify the wave and I fill it with electrolites
Yeah, I got my penman tight
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I wear my heart on my back
So when you talk behind mine
It rips apart when it cracks
After all the bullshit I find it hard to relax
But at least I'm blessed enough to get Bizarre on a track
