[Intro: Bizarre]
Yeah, time to get back on the road
Pack my bags
Get back on the grind
Can't forget the Irish spring
A place I love to be
Canada..

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Get up in the morning, kiss my daughter
Grab my passport, head to the border
Hit customs, do what we gotta do
And I hope this time, that swifty get through
They checked the van, they checked my pants
They checked my man, they checked your man?
Hit Toronto, some call it T Dot
The home of Maestro Fresh
Old school hip hop
And the girls (what?) are so amazing
Black, Indian, I can't stop gazing
Roll a fat J on my way to Thunder Bay
Driving, it'll take about a day
And it's cold outside, they got the cold winters
Detroit Michigan, right across the street from Windsor
When I went to Rockford, all we do is smoke
To eat, all I want is Poutine and a large Coke

[Hook:]
I, I love Canada.. x4
(Bizarre talking: Winston, Toronto, Alberta, Vancouver)

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Touched down in Montreal, give my boys a call (hello)
Air Force Ones, we hit the mall (yeah)
Rush to the head, off in Winnipeg
Downtown Ottawa smoking with the dreads
Nitrogen balloons off in Saskatoon
Clear skies, I think I can see the moon (wow)
Can't wait to get back to Medicine Hat
Vancouver BC, where the best weed at
Edmonton airport, running in a hurry
It's off to Calgary, and then Fort Murray
My eyes is blurry, I ain't got no sleep
Call Aspects up, he got all the freaks
And _____ is one of a kind
I don't mess with nickels, I only bag dimes
Detroit boys, straight from the MO
D12 in Canada, now come to the show

[Hook:]
I, I love Canada.. x4
