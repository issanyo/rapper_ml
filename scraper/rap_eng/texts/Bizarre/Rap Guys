[Intro]
This guy is crazy
This guy is a weirdo
Outsidaz, what you wanna do
This is the gang I'm in
Outsidaz, comin to you

[Verse 1]
Lord have mercy for any rapper that showed up
First it was Oklahoma now its your house I'm blowin up
Cuz I'm quick to butt fuck yo moms
And fuck a nine Bizarre's shootin nuclear bombs
Think about it before you diss me on a track
I hang with niggas that just got out and ready to go back
Bizarre making wack crews fold
Me and Bill Clinton wanna bust in those on homeless 14 years old (she's young)
Doin drive by's in fuckin pink caddies
Tie you up and beat you worse the LL Cool J's daddy
This is a crime that even Mc Gruff couldn't solve
Chew dog and its not you niggas is what leavin revolved
You done fucked around and gotta get a fix
Y'all niggas in trouble cuz I done fucked around and hit a six (rap guys)
Who the fuck is y'all wack niggas ignoring
Put me in a room full of murderers they be dead by the mornin

[Hook:](X2)
Rap guys
Listen to me, Listen to me, rap guys
Diss Bizarre you die

[Verse 2]
We can do this like men
Or talk it we're whit
Or do it my way and drive by later on tonight
Break in your house hang your sister by her shirt
Bury her in the dirt, wait for you moms to get home from work
Id a killed so many M.C's I can't count the number
Niggas writin me letters say "I know what you did last summer"
One rapper tested me and though I was a punk
And I ain't seen his body since I threw it out of my trunk
Fuck around and throw your ass in the lake
And never be found like my high school prom date
Bizarre's too ill, shoot vein in my father's vein
And watch a nigga die like Sugar Hill
I'm sicker than a transvestite gettin fucked by a paraplegic
I say dumb shit when I'm weeded
Your girl sucked me, bitch you better duck me
Or fuck around end up roommates with Mike Hutley

[Hook:](X3)

[Verse 3]
I be watchin shows from here to Chi town
Tell your boys this his last day I'm shuttin this block down
I'm the type a guy come to your stage show and boo you
Tell you you can use my sample and two weeks later I'll sue you
Diss me on your stage show
Diss my while you high
But ain't no guarantee you'll make it out this bitch fuckin alive
I got weed and drinks and some fuckin slut
Fuck her in the butt, burn her back with hot cigarette butts
Quick to throw the fuckin nine up
My crew gets more dirty looks than Queen Latifa in a police line up
Don't wind up like your boy name Romer
Have your parents wondering when your ass is comin out this coma
Smell the aroma when my crew hits the stage
Somebody stop this machine in a rage
Fuck your girl disrespect her then I check her
Bizarre 98 bitch federation records

[Hook:](X3)

Fuck that!
