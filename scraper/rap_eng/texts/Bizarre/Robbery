[Intro: Bizarre]
I mean I gotta eat too
I'm from Detroit nigga

[Hook: Kuniva & Bizarre]
Hey nigga this is a robbery (Get the fuck on the  floor)
Bitch this is a robbery (Man I ain't scared of  shit)
You niggas this is a robbery (Strip butt naked bitch)
Motherfucka this a robbery (I am not playin' wit' y'all)

[Verse 1: Kuniva]
I asked this nigga at the bus stop, "Hey homie you got the time?"
He looked down at his watch then looked up at my nine (Oh shit!)
The same watch that nigga looked at is now mine
With a smirk I laugh as I commit this foul crime
He's lookin' betrayed like he didn't know me for years
While I'm snatching the carats out of his ear, out of fear
This nigga then broke free and started runnin'
Time to start gunnin' and ain't no such thing as I runnin' in a bullet
Nigga now what's coming? This nigga is tryna zigzag
I switch mags and blew a hole out of the bitch back (blaow!)
Really I'm pissed, I wanted that Starter jacket at home
I got some air force ones and a hat to match it
You wouldn't be coughing and gagging and this wouldn't happen
If you just woulda relax instead of runnin' like a faggot
And now I'm ducking off for the night
Put your cash, your jewels, you little watch, your bus pass and your life

[Hook: Kuniva & Bizarre]
Hey nigga this is a robbery (Get the fuck on the floor)
Bitch this is a robbery (Man I ain't scared of shit)
You niggas this is a robbery (Strip butt naked bitch)
Motherfucka this a robbery (I am not playin' wit' y'all)

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I been waiting all week for my fucking royalty check
Been smoking crack so much, I done sold my Corvette
And I ain't a crack head, I'm just crackers
Bitch get out of your car, I'm feelin' kinda jackers
I'm on the run with a loaded gun
Fifteen dollars all ones, you can have my baby son
And I don't know if I got HIV
I had a cold for six months, it burns when I pee
And you acting funny in your brand new IROC
I'm sitting up here with a high top workin' at Jack's car wash
I got no choice but to rob a bank
Run up in there with a shank, a nine with two blanks
Tryna get a record deal what the fuck I'm gonna do
They don't need R&B singers, they got Ja Rule (Murder!)
Damn I can't even get down with DJ Clue
D-12 is broke, that's why I'm robbing you

[Hook: Kuniva & Bizarre]
Hey nigga this is a robbery (Get the fuck on the floor)
