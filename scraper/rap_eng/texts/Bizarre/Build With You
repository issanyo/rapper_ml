[Intro]
One, two, uh, yeah, uh, one, two, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Hey baby, I'm just trying to build with you (build with you)
I'm not here to waste your time (no!)
Was wondering if I could chill with you (chill with you)
Let me live inside your thighs (uh-huh)
Come on and suck my dick, lick the balls, take it all
Come on and suck my dick, lick the balls, take it all, in your jaws

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
I seen you on Facebook, now I see how your face look
I'm scared to approach you, you know how bad I want you
I'm all in your business, seen you at LA Fitness
They call you Ms. Twerk Something (twerk something)
Well, let me see you twerk something
I know you got a nigga, just follow me on Twitter
Know what, I know you got a nigga
Just follow me on Twitter, biatch!

[Verse 2: T3]
You the [epitome?], my sex thoughts, they trapped up like [literary?]
Let me beat them guts into infinity
The enemy is killing me, I really need your everything
Your ass [kick?] keep calling me
Your ass cheeks like bada-bing! [?], my self-esteem is lost
I heard you got that super super, that [sloppy-toppy?], that boss
[?] true religious, but barely wear them drawers
My fantasies is out of reach, not letting me beat off
So pass the kitty, I'm in, let's hit the p-poppin'
Like nonstop 'till the floor drop, 'till the cops stop watchin'
If in-n-out, bring fans, let's turn it up, like ten
Let's spend the night, it's only right, just let the booze slip in, uh!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Swifty McVay]
I'm socializing with this lady, she's so fine
Body shake like a Coca-Cola bottle, I co-sign
She ain't a model, never gave birth to a toddler
Never ask for a dollar, but when it's time to swallow, damn mama
I gotta take these headphones off, I see you niggas tomorrow
(Man, what the fuck you doing?!)
I'm sorry, my mind is normally into working
But ever since I met you up in the gentleman club twerking
You been getting on my verses, I wanna meet your O.G. fast
And I'ma give her a trophy and plaque
Just for delivering your fine ass (damn!)
You hearing this?
You got the type of clit to make me hit it on your period
(Oh, hell no!) I'm serious
