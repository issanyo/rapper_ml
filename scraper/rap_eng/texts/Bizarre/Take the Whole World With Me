[Intro: Bizarre]
Check this out
This is Bizarre
And this is the rap king DJ Butter
From tha Outsidaz
Bam Bam Bam!
Dirty Dozen
Outsidaz
Taking the whole world with me
2 blunts and I'm bringing ya girl with me

[Verse 1: Pacewon]
I'm high like Redman
Trippin' with a tab of acid in my headband
The name's Pacewon I'll kick that ass quickly
When I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Four rhymes penetrate ya kidneys
When I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
(I got plans to lock it down)
Take it with me
Take it with me
The whole world with me
I'll be hittin you with rude shit
I be rollin' like crews with new whips
Call it stupid but I've mastered the fantastic ghetto bastard
More rap style to kick that ass with
Rough as Brillo, nympho
Spreading like info
More than the Jacksons got kinfolk
Ya crew not strong
They stink like ya mother's feet
When she walk in shoes with no socks on
Light as popcorn
Me disciplining' fresh emcees that you'd be scared to rock for
I'm low down and I'm shifty
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Most emcees get slapped cause they sissy
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm in a soundproof booth without a roof
Drunk off 180 proof Vodka with Dr. Ruth
We in the vocal room inhalin magic markers
Sitting in the dark lightin our blunts with sparklers
We got my man Pacewon behind the boards
Because we tied the engineer up with outlet cords
Bizarre's in tha lobby with the Beatles
Smokin bowls, pokin holes in his veins with dirty needles
We get all doped up from poppin uppers
And run a train on Foxy Brown without rubbers
Smokin homegrown drugs
That's why you can barely tell what the fuck we're saying like Bone Thugs
Hittin blunts till my lungs get too much smoke
And take one more short toke before I snort coke
Shit, I been doing lines all day
My mind's all clay from smelling Pine Sol spray
What, no hold up hold up hold up
Smokin laced weed wrapped up in a fruit roll up
My lungs are all swol' up about to bust open
I'm just hopin I don't die from snortin crushed Motrin
I need drugs, somebody fix me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
12 bluntz plus I'm bringin ya girl with me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
I'm not comin' back, so don't send no one to get me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Fuck that, gimmee all my shit free
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
Wack emcees there's a new sheriff in town
Put ya guns down and die with an ill frown!
Tha Outsidaz doin uppas and downas
Clowners, even massa scared to hang around us
I'm a slob that don't have job
Peep through your window to steal the cook from ya mom
We just starters, ya'll niggas hit the bitches
Smackin more hoes than Jo Jackson has felony conviction
Clouds of mushrooms I just can't see
Pull me out tha bathroom I'm 'bout to OD!
Nasty, dirty some say I'm filthy
Everytime I drop a rap I'm a be like
MMMRRRRPHHH!
Crazy high, have no fear
Eat the pussy of a girl with burning diarrhoea
I'm ready to box so the bell go ding ding
My crew's more stupid and whack than Zazu from Lion King
Who's the big guy high off Chocolate Thai
If you disrespect me you'll lyrically die
Somebody hide me, somebody get me
When I die I take the whole world with me
I'm bout to do your girl named Cindy
When I die I take the whole world with me
Your grandma said I give as good as cleany
When I die I take the whole world with me

[Outro]
You know my flo is so ill
Emcees on the microphone'll get verbally killed
