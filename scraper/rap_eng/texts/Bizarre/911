Gorillaz
Back the fuck up
D12

[Proof]
The new terrors in rock
On every block
Late for school, late for work
But ahead of these cops
My credit is shot, end up dead in a box, right?
Until my life ends as pathetic as Pac's
A waste of the talent,  they say my boys is just nowhere
Placed on the planet, remain in poisonous warfare
Derelict Arabic terrorists in the air
Shit, arrogant, apparent to punish people by their heritage
NATO barriers, hate embarrassed
There is the faith to cherish
In your room face to face with race awareness
A race to scare off the army bombing, your God is with you
Calm over war, we got a starter pistol
Cause if you right, and know you right, then where's your righteous ways
We sacrifice, snatch your life, many nights and days
Follow me into equality, we might behave
And only Christ can save the trife when we unite again

[Kuniva]
America's own, without a fucking care in my dome
Barin' my bones, I'm far away staring at home
Stay at my zone, falling asleep, lay with my chrome
Fahrenheit from these rockets burning like straightening combs
Stay at the streets, bullshit and playing for keeps
Spray at your peeps for christmas, give a K to my niece
Real niggas feel us and fear us, Gorillaz beat on they chest when
Danger is near us, I hope that you hear us
The spirit of Bugz is still in me
God bless it, the Trinity
Cause my bullets, they come in threes like trilogies
Put the knife away, missles always strike and blaze
So much smoke you can't tell the difference of night and day
Right away, blow your life away, so light your haze
Hold tight grenedes so when it blows I'm slightly grazed
Kuniva might be crazed, unleashing unlikely rage
The next time you hear a verse from me I might be caged

[Bizarre]
Every night I talk to a black hawk
Taking heroin in bulks, watch my body hit the chalks
I'm too lazy, mescaline's got me crazy
Rape this old lady, while the bitch was having a baby
And I ain't never going home, Bizarre too far gone
This cold got me deciphering right from wrong
As I sit in my seat and remain calm
And close my eyes and wait for the bomb
(Here it comes!)

[Swifty]
II'm getting the fuck on, I'm aggravated
I know I'll make it, I'm in a place full of hatred
Treating my life like it's sacred
Try to check me, I break your neck
Disrespect me, you'll get injected
It's hectic when some bullshit happen when you least expect it
But we just won't accept it, nigga
I go ahead and lift my trigger
Get rid of bitches, pay you a visit, then get your shit lit
I'm a nitwit with a big dick and big balls
I don't miss shit
I hit all, whoever that did this
We gonna getchy'all

[Kon Artis]
Now whether its Saddam or Bin Laden that's been startin' all this trouble for us
Creeping horrors, doing show after show, sleeping on the tour bus
We lost Aaliyah, lost our families, it takes no genius
You dont need us to say the world is fucked up, y'all can see it
Now it seems the public needs this shit to calm its kids
Cause they findin' out how you lied about your twisted sins
They say we bad for you, but shit, our music is your friend
They can't deter you from the truth cause we the helping hand

[Terry Hall]
We are one, and one is all
We are, we are, we are one
And one is all

[Hook]
