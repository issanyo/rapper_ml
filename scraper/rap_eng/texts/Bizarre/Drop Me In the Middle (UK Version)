[Intro: Natasha Bedingfield & Bizarre]
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
Bizarre from D12
Here we go with my girl Natasha
From the low-end, ha ha ha

[Verse 1: Natasha Bedingfield]
I think I found the recipe for creativity
Put all you've got, then add some heart
They fence us in to break us down
But still, they can't shut us down
The walls are thin
But still, they're strong
We're broken, but we beat as one

[Pre-Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield & Bizarre]
Oh, I'm coming from the streets of London
What I'm saying happens everywhere
Yeah
Oh, so tryna do something different, something different
Sumthin' different
Oh, people standing on the side just watching
Like they're scared or they just don't care
Oh, but I wanna be where it's happening, where it's happening
What, what, what, what, what?

[Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield]
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
Upon the ocean, I'll be the moon that turns the tide
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple
A domino effect, falling through the sands of time

[Post-Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield]
Da-da-da, oh, da-da-da, oh
Da-da-da, oh, da-da-da, oh

[Verse 2: Natasha Bedingfield & Bizarre]
Think I'll change the temperature
'Til it's the right weather
Here in the core, it's getting warm
Too many channels, nothing on
To turn it off, it just takes one
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield & Bizarre]
Oh, I'm coming from the streets of London
What I'm saying happens everywhere
What?
Oh, so tryna do something different, something different
Gotta do something
Oh, people standing on the side just watching
Get, get over here
Oh, 'cause you gotta be where it's happening, where it's happening
What, what, what, what, what?

[Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield]
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
Upon the ocean, I'll be the moon that turns the tide
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple
A domino effect, falling through the sands of time

[Post-Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield]
Da-da-da, oh, da-da-da, oh
Da-da-da, oh, da-da-da, oh

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
D12, Bizarre, the big kid that raps
A thousand kids in shower caps
How you like that?
People hear D12 and start running
'Cause we be partyin' from Detroit to London
Autographs and hugs, wherever you want it
Matter of fact, you can rub on my my big stomach
Born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto
I need a medal for getting the hell out the ghetto
'Cause all I do is rap and eat steaks
And wish the world was a better place
'Cause when you're up, they try to take you down
Mess your day up and turn your smile into a frown
Well, you ain't worried, then I ain't either
C'mon Bush, make Bizarre the leader
'Cause rap is my only way out
I'm gonna dye my hair green and join No Doubt

[Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield & (Bizarre)]
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect (what?)
Upon the ocean, I'll be the moon that turns the tide
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple
A domino effect, falling through the sands of time
(Affectin' the world)
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
Upon the ocean I'll be the moon that turns the tide
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple
A domino effect falling through the sands of time

[Outro: Bizarre & (Natasha Bedingfield)]
Why you little?
I've seen you big boy
(Drop me in the middle)
Tasha, Bizarre
(Drop me in the middle)
The big guy
