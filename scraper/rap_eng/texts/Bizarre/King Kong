[Intro: Bizarre]
Yeah, D-Twizzie
Back in the lab
Ayo, fire that weed up, pass it around
King Kong, bitch
All my niggas is gorillas
Fuck the other animals, nigga I’m the king of the jungle
Yeah, beware
(King Kong, ain’t got shit on me!)

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Fourteen blunts, sixteen stobeys
Who wanna get their jaw broke by Sugar Shane Mosley?
Battle rapper, grew up in the cypher
You grew up a lover, I grew up a fighter
I eat rappers, twenty times a day
All you can eat like Old Country Buffet
Regular weed, I don’t even smoke
Hoes come over and get licked like a envelope
I’ll smack your auntie, then kill your mother
I just wanna fuck somebody up like Raz B brother
Me, Von, and Swift, we like to commodores
Come to a D12 party, we got all types of whores
Don’t worry ‘bout hotel rooms, we got all types of floors
And we’ll be smoking weed till a quarter past four
So run up, try actin’ crazy
You’ll get your back cracked but not by a Chinese lady
Bizarre, Eddy [?] from Oz, I got a lotta bars
I’m King Kong bitch, but to you I’m God

[Hook: Sample] (x2)
King Kong, ain’t got shit on me!

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I have an attitude beyond belief
So when I palm this heat, I’ll leave your body layin’ all in the street
I’m a big dog walkin’
My body ain’t worth shit, it’s kinda backwards ‘cause it hurts when the fifth starts barkin’
I’m even better than before, iller metaphors
Killas bet it all on ‘Niva, one shot dead ‘em all
And that’s for Big Pun, big guns, plus a mean mug equals get funds, bitch run
I tear this whole place up, sniff a half a cake up
Then hog a loogy in your girl’s make up
Brandishin’ pistols with 40s laughin’
Up in your shorty in the asses, makin’ moves like I’m choreographin’
My dialect is full of disrespect, fuck the rules, bust a Uz’
You playin’ while I eat [?]
That’s how it is, how I live, nigga holla at me
I oughta join PETA homie, ‘cause I’m llama happy, blow!

[Hook: Sample] (x2)
King Kong, ain’t got shit on me!

[Verse 3: Swifty McVay]
McVay, I’m that scandalous, a black bastard
Puttin’ holes in a nigga’s face like a jack-o-lantern, I can’t fathom
Being attacked, don’t try me
I spasm and leave these shots planted in that ass like an IV
I’m grimy, lyrically toxic, a death prophet that cannot stop it
On fire like the back of rockets
In a mosh pit, stompin’ mommas for talkin’ shit
I’m a pill poppin’ advocate, bitch I will not quit
If you ain’t payin’ homage to this Loch Ness Monster, we gon’ have a problem
While my claws grip your revolver, I don’t knock niggas unconsciousness
You’ll be forever unresponsive, dwellin’ in a realm of darkness
I park in front of your crib, walk on your porch with all fours
And I piss on your kids, a reservoir dog
That’ll force y’all to torture each other, and this is not solved
I’m on a couch laughin’ at all y’all, what?

[Hook: Sample] (x2)
King Kong, ain’t got shit on me!
