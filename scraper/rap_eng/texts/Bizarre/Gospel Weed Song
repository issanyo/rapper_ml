[Intro:]
Brothers and sisters!
We gonna have Church tonight!
And tonight this speaker is, Reverend Rufus Jackson

[Hook:]
I wake up praising, God every day
I wanna smoke some weed and roll me a J
Thankya Jesus! (Thankyou Jesus!)
Thankya Lord! (Thankyou Lord!)
For lettin' me live another day! Hey! hey!

[Verse 1:]
Nigga I'm high, nigga you high. (uh huh)
Lets get higher then the motherfucking sky!
Watch the butterflies, hit the wall
And if you're feeling down, give your boy a call!
Weed, it takes the stress away
That's why Bizarre smokes ten blunts a day
It's nothing but the sticky, icky, green stuff!
Light it, pass it and take a puff!
Having a bad day, stop by my house
'Cause most likely, I've got a blunt in my mouth
So sit down relax and chill
And if ya don't smoke weed, then shit, I got some pills!
Watch ya need girl
A fucking refill?
A fat bag a weed
And some happy meals?
Nah, baby, I don't smoke newports
Only fat bags of weed in this escort

[Hook:]
I wake up praising, God every day
I wanna smoke some weed and roll me a J
Thankya Jesus! [Thankyou Jesus!]
Thankya Lord! [Thankyou Lord!]
For lettin' me live another day! Hey! hey!

[Verse 2:]
Sunday morning, Bizarre have day
Blunt in my mouth, watching DJ Dre
Dangerous mind, just like Coolio
Only church I know, is Snoop Dogg's studio
White Owl's wraps, rolled in my lap
Rap hennesy, keep the acid tap
I'm glad, that I didn't go down south
Take care of my kids, be the man of the house
Orange mushrooms, and yellow stars
Fat bags of Doritos in mason jars
Get in and lap, come on jump in
Raid a bottle of gin, and two of your freaky friends
Oh fuck it! Let's go to Cedar Point
Bring your son alone, shit, he can hit the joint
Cause rapping, it's a full time job!
All I wanna smoke weed and praise God!

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Break it down yea
We gonna slow it down rite here
We havin' Church up in here tonight, it's the Reverend Rufuss Johnson
And we sittin' over here
At sixteen five-o, cone it
And ladies and gentlemen
Come in, praise God with us..

[Over Hook:]
Baptist
Catholic
Jehova Witness
Yea, come praise God
Yea! services, send it

Brothers and sisters send it at 4-20!
Come on, praise God
Just 'cause you smoke weed don't mean you a sinner! What!?

[Bizarre: speaking]
Just 'cause you smoke weed don't mean you don't believe in God!
Jesus will keep care of ya! Jesus!
You need Jesus!
