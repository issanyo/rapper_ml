[Verse One]
I'm involved with this lady
And she weighs 380
And she barely can fit in my Mercedes
She's taking my dough, my bank accounts
Looking low
And I'm bout to throw her ass out in the snow
I buy her burgers and steaks and all type of stuff
But KFC and Ponderosa's just not enough

[Hook]
Down low
Fat ho
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho (Don't you be telling your friends)
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho (I thought KFC was enough)
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho (I gave you all my food)

[Verse Two]
You came to my place high off Bacardi
Had the nerve to strip dance at my boy's bachelor party
She gave me head and broke my bed
And there's really nothing else to be said

[Hook]
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho (Girl, you're being my mother)
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho
(I'm tired of shopping at Maryanne Plus)
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho (Super-size combo)
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho (I had a very fine ho at work)
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho
(You had to go and steal my cheesecake)
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho
(That's what you get for eating fried chicken)
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho (That's why the fuck you're too fat)
Keep it on the down low
(Hooooooooooooooe)
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho (You gotta stop paging me girl)
Keep it on the down low
Fat ho
(Federation Records ain't got my number)
(Keep it on the down low)
