Yeah this is dedicated to the big pussy

[Bizarre]
I'm involved with this lady and she weighs 380
And she could barely fit in my Mercedes
She's taking my dough
My back accounts looking low
And I'm about to throw her ass out in the snow
I buy her burgers and steaks and all type of stuff
But KFC and pot roasts are just not enough

Chorus:
Down low, fat ho
Keep it on the down low, fat ho (Don't you be telling your friends)
Keep it on the down low, fat ho (I though KFC was enough)
Keep it on the down low, fat ho (I gave you all my food)

[Bizarre]
You came to my place high off of Picartie
You had the nerve to strip dance at my boy's bachelor party
She gave me head and broke my bed
And there's really nothing else to be said

Chorus:
Keep it on the down low, fat ho
Keep it on the down low, fat ho (Girl you're bigger than my mother)
Keep it on the down low, fat ho (I'm tired of shopping at Mary Ann Plus)
Keep it on the down low, fat ho (Super size combos)
Keep it on the down low, fat ho
Keep it on the down low, fat ho (I have a very fat ho in the world)
Keep it on the down low, fat ho (You had to go and steal my cheese cake)
Keep it on the down low, fat ho (You gonna stop paging Rico)
Keep it on the down low, fat ho
Keep it on the down low, fat ho

[Bizarre]
Federation Records ain't got my number
Keep it on the down low
