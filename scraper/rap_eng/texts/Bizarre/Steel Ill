[Intro: Denaun]
Yeah, I said hospital bills, that's really real
Uh, uh, hospital bills, Kuniva's really ill

[Verse 1: Kuniva]
Somebody tell Mr. [?] to get the chains off the door
Your highness, stupid and lower, and lower she on the floor
I'm feeling her, Mr. [?], here for the nutter
Brown paper bag pimpin' and I'm looking like "what up?"
Boss hogging, shady niggas who's known for keeping it [diddly?]
Cutter's eyes, finger popping bitches on the steely
We get to cutting up like some Puerto Ricans
You can smell the stank on us like we outta Sequin
Peep it, squeeze the heat to frequent, why not
Why blow up my spot? Cause y'all both got shot
Now check it, feeling Nancy, still in the pantry, until I'm manly
That's not a punchline, I'm really feeling Nancy
Me and the clique, we mobbing, performing Kama Sutra
All on your broad, while you in the booth sounding like Future
We fucking with condoms, we fucking with condoms, yeah
We fucking with condoms, we fucking with condoms, yeah

[Hook: Denaun]
Ayo, hospital bills, that's really real
We actually still, clumsy with the bullets, man
Is Mac really stale? (Yeah!)
Does nine really spill (Yeah!)
I said, hospital bills, that's really real
Actually still, clumsy with the bullets, man
Does mine really spill
I said Denaun's really ill (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Denaun]
Ayo, niggas keep popping off
Bet I get his fam hit, lightning with the hands
Credit it to the Shazam shit
Crowds come from miles out just to see the man spit
I can't send dick pics, the shit won't fit the bandwidth (whoo!)
The 19's backpack, fuck who you stand with
Play a couple jams that make you two [?] sit
Pack gats bigger than Shaq in a Kazam flick
We ran out of body bags, I'm hoping the Saran fit
Call Olivia Pope, and Fitz, they won't get you damn wits of this hell sandwich
I'm trying to learn to speak Espa√±ol, yo
Me and Han Solo went to a Bon Jo show
Wearing bucket jackets with Decepticon logos
Transformer with the Upper Ashelon flow though
The nine's more sorta like Alonzo
Head honcho, you're more like Gonzo in a poncho
I am Carlito Brigante you are Donnie Brasco
I am now with the Illuminati
They want me to sacrifice Ashanti
With the dagger of Asante, fuck it, uh, what, I got the knife

[Hook: Denaun]
Ayo, hospital bills, that's really real
We actually still, clumsy with the bullets, man
Is Mac really stale? (Yeah!)
Does nine really spill (Yeah!)
I said, hospital bills, that's really real
Actually still, clumsy with the bullets, man
Does mine really spill
I said Denaun's really ill (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
(Hahaha, yeah) Sexy male dancer
But I'm hardly working, Adidas and Nike suit on
But I'm steadily burping,  handicapped ugly bitch
But I'm steadily flirting, jacking off in the Walmart
(Bitch, close the curtains!) Smoking dope with cab drivers
I'm past tired, black [?] fire, the fat Michael Myers
I'm at the bar, buying a lot of drinks, she said "fuck Bizarre"
But she eating a lot of shanks, be scared as hell
She think I'ma shoot, I ain't tryna get your number bitch
I'm trying to get a booze
Before we fuck, I told her "you owe me Slim Shady"
After I bust a nut? Bitch, you must be crazy!
I'm on couple's therapy, popping pills and drinking gin
I know it's a sin, but I'm attracted to men (Pause!)
No pause, a lot of balls, in my dirty ass jaws

[Hook: Denaun]
Ayo, hospital bills, that's really real
We actually still, clumsy with the bullets, man
Is Mac really stale? (Yeah!)
Does nine really spill (Yeah!)
I said, hospital bills, that's really real
Actually still, clumsy with the bullets, man
Does mine really spill
I said Denaun's really ill (Yeah, yeah)
