Intro - Bizarre

I'm talking about these nasty
Stinkin ass bitches out here
These skinny, fat, nasty....
BITCHES
I love em though! (laughs)
I love my handycap bitch!
Fix my breakfast!

Chorus x2

All my life, i been a hoe
But it really don't matter no more
And they wonder why we act this way
D12 gon' be ok, ok??

Verse 1 - Bizarre

Came in the game, with H.I.V
The nastiest nigga in the 3.1.3
Fucked with no rubber ain't no helpin me
Fuckin bitches with no rubber, no option
I been fuckin since i was 9, and i ain't stoppin
Bizarre too sick, who got the answer
Fuckin a titty dancer, with breast cancer
My son tellin me, daddy be strong
With this H.I.V shit, you won't live long
And damn girl, you look fine
I don't give a fuck if you 9, like R. Kelly out on the bump n grind
R&B chicks, i'll try it, i fucked Mariah four times
But she gon' deny it, cos i went in her 9 times, before the sunrise
Bitch you gonna die, damn i hope i don't say it again
Damn i hope this bitch suck my dick again
You can suck and suck and go head slitherin', (put ya head down)
Go ahead, finish it

Chorus x2

Verse 2 -

See i'm a hoe but not a hoe nigga
Ain't scared of no nigga, i tell a bitch quick
If ya knew better, ya do better
I don't want you to stay up under my nose
Just bring me the dough and another one of your hoes
That's all i wanna know, bitch now quit
You think i'm ??? , you comin out that guest outfit
We gon' mess around and have to pull a train on your chick
And let Bizarre hit after he rape his pig
Have that bitch comin' home with a stanky clit
Now she's lying to you, i know this shit'll make ya sick
You gon' hit n pay the rent, forget about it
Cos she was satan sick, and that's the way your ass allowed it
I seen your bitch, out in a crowded house
With her mouth inside of somebodies croch
And she was wilin out (did you fuck her?)
Without a doubt, i'm not about to miss that shit
See i'm a hoe, and your mommas proud
