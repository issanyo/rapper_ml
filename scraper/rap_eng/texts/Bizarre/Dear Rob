Dear Rob, I heard about your situation
I was in Detroit stuck on vacation
I dropped the album, it's called *Tweek Sity*
You can get it on iTunes download, it's $3.50
(no one cares)
Alright, i heard you were depressed well
I'm here to relieve all your fucking stress
I heard about you and Black Chyna
How every man in LA fucked her vagina
T.I. said he fucked her, that's a fact
Rob, you shouldn't have never mentioned that
Rob believe me, I know what you're going through
Cause T.I., he fucked my baby momma too
(Forreal?) Nah I'm lying, trying to cheer you up
Lift you up
They seen you on Facebook, they seen you on Instagram
The whole world watched you fucking go HAM
See Rob, I used to weigh 365
Eat burgers and fries at home ready to die
[?] I was the man, I used to be on top
Until Tyler the Creator took my spot
Rob, you know what's so fucking weird
I ain't even know Eminem grew a beard
Cause I ain't seen him in fucking years
Stop this song, I'm about to go in tears
Rob I'm old news, getting stepped on like old shoes
Getting talked about known as the old dude
It sounds like I'm going off
You don't like what I'm saying, turn this song off
Dear Rob, I'm trying to keep you educated
I ain't [?] but niggas stay medicated
You're a Kardashian, Rob, walk with pride
And don't be scared to bring your ass outside
Take your shirt off Rob, let 'em see your stomach
And believe me, all the black girls'll love it
Facebook Rob you need to chill
And you need to tell Bruce how you really feel
[?] sex change [?]
You madder that he won't take you and your little brother fishing
Man i know you hate that shit
You should have some Mexicans rape that bitch
And I'ma tape that shit
That was some racist shit
They don't care about me Rob, they care about you
My career is through, I ain't been out since '92
Give me advice,  give me a call
And I'll be at your door step with some Adderall
I love you
Dear Rob
