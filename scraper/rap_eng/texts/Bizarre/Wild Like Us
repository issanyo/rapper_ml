[Intro: Bizarre]

Yeah
Ahh Ahh
Repeat after me
Here we go

[Hook: Bizarre and King Gordy]

Get punched in your face get your teeth knocked out
(Wild like us, wild like us)
I'll jump off the stage and whoop your ass
(Wild like us, wild like us)

Verse 1:
I'm higher than the mutherfucking ceiling
I feel like my face is peeling
Nigga I'm iller, I'm outta control
Blindfold, I'll take your soul
Mutherfucker I'm going to mars
This is for the people that love bizarre
I'm a star, going to pluto
Ass cheeks out, i'm deep down, you know [?]
And you know, I be on sick shit
