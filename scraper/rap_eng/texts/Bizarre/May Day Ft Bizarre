[Intro: Bizarre]

Bizarre
This is song for the ladies called
Mayday!
(Hahahaha)

[Verse 1 - Cruger]
Mayday Mayday, it's the rape tape
I'm eating my organs hoping that they land in the same place
Ain't shaved in years, caveman's beard
Take it as a compliment when they say I'm weird
Need to lay off beer and quit smoking
Showing off my muscles by ripping my skin open
I could build Rome in a day
Blow up estates by throwing grenades over the gates
Drop bombs not beats
I'm an obscene beast with strong teeth, but I've only got three
Lay my vengeance upon thee
Watch police, entire SWAT teams couldn't stop me
Barking mad up the wrong tree
All the best rappers are dead, that's why we're zombies
Ungodly, so soulless it seems
Automatic doors won't open for me

[Hook x2]
[Scratching]
Became a monster, need I remind you?
Shotty in the trunk and on my ankle is a 9 too
I'm deadly when I pull the pen out
I left 'em on the floor spittin' phlegm out
Became a monster, need I remind you
You ain't no enemy, my friends are worse
I'm deadly when I pull the pen out

[Verse 2 - Lord Measle]
I ride an ice cream truck so kids can come to me
Tell them just on front, I'll give you one for free
I wright ransoms with my right hand
So on trial they canâ€™t be matched with my rhyme pad
Resurrected before life
I died and decided to get out of the white chalk lines
Snatch kids from your community
And stalk women cause when they run in heels it amuses me
Corpses are picked apart, found missing arms
And then kept with other body pieces in killing jars
But it's not crime, this is art
And I'm trying to make the perfect bitch outta my victims parts
I don't show no peace and love
Born again Satanist, rising out of sea of blood
If you see me run, don't think police with come
Six percent of rapes get solved, that motivates me to fuck

[Hook x2]
Became a monster need I remind you?
Shotty in the trunk and on my ankle is a 9 too
I'm deadly when I pull the pen out
I left 'em on the floor spittin' phlegm out
Became a monster, need I remind you
You ain't no enemy, my friends are worse
I'm deadly when I pull the pen out

[Verse 3 - Bizarre]
Danger zone, (yeah) black King Kong (yeah)
Smoking a zong, home alone, jacking a dong (uhh)
Weirdest, most feardest
Tear off your ear, so you can fucking hear this
Blonde wigs, break in niggas cribs
Eatin' the ribs of abandoned, handicapped kidnapped kids (hahaha)
Lonely and depressed, damn near homeless
Eat your mouth and teeth, leave you novice
Blue and black capris, black and white seats
Fuck the peace, it's time for Bizarre to eat (damn)
A thousand for any MC that wanna battle
I'm so paranoid, I'm shooting my own shadow
Doing kiddie porn with Kelly Osbourne
Lips get opened up, ass cheeks get torn [Uhh]
Xanax mixed with depression, black Smith and Wesson
12 Gauge to your head, it's time for breakfast

[Outro]
2010 to Infinity
Bizarre (yeah) (yeah) (yes)
RAPE TAPE!
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life !
