Where is Marshall ? Who the hell cares ?
Bizarre's on stage, shaking his derrier (hey hey)
I'm a rock star, touch my belly
Hugs and kisses get my clothes all sweaty
I'm the man, The lead singer of the band
On stage, for thousands of fans (cheers)
Or you could be a dancer for Hammer
If you look you could see me in the camera
Acting like Luther Vandross
Anything to get them clothes off (yea)
The fans want Bizarre, they don't want Em
I'm backstage making out with Kim

I'm on T.R.L. with David Chappelle
Talking about the little two days I did in jail stop
Give me a sandwhich, feed me lunch
You want some water ? (girl)
Girl where's my punch ?
If I don't get punch, you gon' get punched (poof !)
Baby baby forget lunch
The guy with the shower cap running the streets
Big old stomache, they all know me
Last video, I was in the back
Now I started a group with Horney Mac

Me and 50 working out (one more !)
Show you what the rock stars all about
It's been a while, I'm coming out
Doing laps around Jimmy Iovine's house
I don't drive, I got a chauffer to pick me up
Big old truck that's all beat up (hahaha)
Blue Cadillac, Diamond in the Back
(Dr. Dre's on line one)
Tell him to call me back
I'm too busy to take his call!
I'm at the mall, collecting girls' drawers (yea !)
This Rock Star stuff is the life for me
June 28, buy my CD
