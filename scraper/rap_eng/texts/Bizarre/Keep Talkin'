[Ad Lib: Bizarre]
Yeah
Detroit motherfucker
DJ Green Lantern (the evil genius)
D12
We ain't going nowhere
We still smoking crack nigga!
Ha ha
Let them know
HA-HA

[Hook: Eminem]
Bitch, keep talking
Keep on popping off, with them jaws because, we ain't stopping
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking
Keep on popping that shit you're popping
'Cause we ain't stopping, 'cause you ain't stopping us
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking

[Verse 1: Kuniva]
Yo, (Kuniva!) the derelict's back
I'm blazing niggas while they up in the Sheraton last
I even sold my therapist crack
You niggas is bitch, straight up, I'm bearing the facts
I love pussy wit' all my heart but I'm married to gats
And nigga I'm top pedigree so don't play wit' me
I'll blow your tattoos all over your baby seat
Kids and all been hit
Peers and all Mossberg will take your back, liver ribs and all
Kuniva the street talker, heat sparker the beef starter
Packing guns when I'm sleep walking
(Bitch, keep talking)
Throwing fire bombs down your chimney
While you eating at Wendy's
I'm in your bushes cocking the semi
Nice with the hands
Never bow down to another man
I was popping guns while you was still popping some rubber bands
Smother your clan
Sever your hands and your legs
Mail your brother your heart and send your mother your head

[Verse 2: Swift]
I'm the only one your bitch let touch her
Type of brother that will fuck your mother
With a fishnet rubber
A belligerent and rowdy motherfucker
That'll dump your body and still fly away to Maui on Atella
When it comes to beefing, it ain't no explaining
I'll change your language with a stainless
I'm contained with an anguish to leave you famous
I'm a deranged pit, I lift an AK and paint your face with
Niggas don't say shit, fuck your hype man
If it's a bystander standing by, I'm fire in at your, 'cause I can
You get squashed like pop cans
I be shooting 7 up in your mouth, man
I'm about to sell your mama bud and lace it
So when she fire it up she's coughing blood
I love to see 'em wasted
I'm made to behave in this case
You try to be brave in this rage and your legs will be replaced

[Hook: Eminem]
Bitch, keep talking
Keep on popping off, with them jaws because, we ain't stopping
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking
Keep on popping that shit you're popping
'Cause we ain't stopping, 'cause you ain't stopping us
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
(Bizzy, come on!) I ain't here to talk about Benzino or Ja Rule
I'm here to talk about little Ray Ray and what I'ma do
Psyche, I ain't gonna mention it, he'd probably sue
Next week, this shit'll be out on DJ Clue (Exclusive)
The first time I had sex... a dirty mattress
No condom... my grandmother... bent over backwards
Bizarre been fucking raw all summer
Lets make a trade, my wife for your brother
Psyche, I'm not bisexual
I'm an intellectual, transsexual, one testicle (one nut!)
And I ain't saying shit just 'cause it rhyme
I got colon cancer, I'm dying

[Verse 4: Proof]
YAY! YAY!
Rest in peace Jam Master Jay, 2Pac and Notorious BIG
I'm probably the best
God in the flesh
Blow your heart out your chest
And your chest out your vest
Leave your body a mess streets bloody as hell
Study my trail I cut him he fail
A druggy on bail nutty as well
Which such like Buddy Revel
Dead or in jail
Still heading for hell
The ghetto rebels the wrong guy
Hit your lungs, heart
Leave you full of holes like SpongeBob
We can set this from your front door to your CEO office
Got the key to your coffin (So bitch keep talkin')
Greet me wit' offers we taken over
Or get China white mixed wit' baking soda
Your hear me
GET IT CRACKED!

[Outro: Eminem]
Fucking crack heads
And this is just mix tape shit you fucking morons
This ain't brains over brawns
This is bullies over fucking pussies
Ha ha, come on

[Hook: Eminem]
Bitch, keep talking
Keep on popping off, with them jaws because, we ain't stopping
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking
Keep on popping that shit you're popping
'Cause we ain't stopping, 'cause you ain't stopping us
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking
