(feat. Sindee Syringe)

(Intro: Sindee Syringe)
Whatsup people!?
This is Sindee Syringe!
We're here up in here snortin' sum lines! and we're all goin' straight to hell!

(Verse 1: Bizarre)
Man I pop so many pills, it's startin' to get scary!
(woman: Bizzare, I'm your wife) Bitch, I ain't lairy!
And I don't give a fuck about pullin' out my dick
Look at the name of my clit
It's D12 hoe! (Yeah, baby!)
It's D12 hoe! (Yeah, baby!)
Yea, yea
Bizarre smoke atcha and got no problem
For 10 hot dollars I fuck your bitch at the cavana(?)
VD, AIDs that's what Bizarre got
For ten thousand michael jackson will give me a shot
I sniff blow, high off a brick
Crash into a ditch on 6-96
Nasty nigga, quick to lick the finger
Eat a bitch ass, that tastes like a butter finger
And I'm going to hell for my nasty mouth
But this is what Rock 'n' roll's all about

(Chorus: Sindee Syringe)
I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again!
My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe...
We hate life, hate life, hate life
FUCK YOUR LIFE!

I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again!
My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe...
We hate life, hate life, hate life
FUCK YOUR LIFE!

(Verse 2: Bizarre)
Ever since I was a kid I had a violent past
Whooped a nurse ass for touching my diaper rash!
And I ain't goin' work, I'm a lazy shit
That's why I'm living warn with a fat white bitch
She's 36 and keeps a gun full of arsenal
But son's 13, loves to listen to Marshall
But I whoop his ass, and send him a school
And let 'em know, that taking drugs is cool!
See I'm on sum dumb shit, don't know right from wrong
All up on murder Inc. trying to get Ja Rule on a song
And I used to be a virgin, grown-ass man
Until I took a trip off to Neverland
Mike gave me milk and cookies, showed me his room
Kicked his ass over, I fucked 'im with a broom, coz...

(Chorus: Sindee Syringe)
I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again!
My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe...
We hate life, hate life, hate life
FUCK YOUR LIFE!

I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again!
My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe...
We hate life, hate life, hate life
FUCK YOUR LIFE!

(Verse 3: Bizarre)
All day I dream about sex
Fucking handicap bitch, me, Proof and Hex!
And I don't give a fuck about no Britney Spears
Just tie the bitch up, nut in her ears!
Bucks said when I'm a cash 'for I could get it for ten(?)
For the last three months you know where I been!
Snorting, shooting, getting a fix
Got two Indian bitches in the motel 6
Four bags and twenty bears
And I don't even know who the fuck D12 is!
I'm on the stage doing a lovesong, (forever...)
You'll fall, knowing damn well I'm wrong
And I don't want no prostitute to have no sex
I wanna bitch to break my neck, while I try to get her wet!
So, kids! Don't smoke no weed!
Cause you'll end up just like me!

(Chorus: Sindee Syringe)
I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again!
My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe...
We hate life, hate life, hate life
FUCK YOUR LIFE!

I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again!
My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe...
We hate life, hate life, hate life
FUCK YOUR LIFE!

Nigga fuck you life!
Nigga!
Nigga fuck my life!
