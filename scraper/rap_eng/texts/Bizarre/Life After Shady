[Intro]
Weirdo (ah)
Alright
Look what they (woo)

[Chorus]
Look what they done to me (ah)
Look what they done to me (wo-wo-wo)
Look what they done to me
Look what they done to me
I'm a motherfucking loser, failure
Loser
I'm a motherfucking loser, failure
Loser, failure

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I am god
Get on your knees and do your job
She likes to slob
Suck on my dick like a corn on the cob (sucky, sucky)
Fucking nigga
Stupid nigga
Fat punk from Ash and Grand River (hahahaha)
You know me
I might OD
Sniff a whole key
Blew my kidney
Blowing sticky
They say Marshall he in love with Nicki (huh?)
Not Nicki Minaj
Not the one that I jack off in the garage (Nicki)
If you love her then prove it
I got her tatted on my arm
Let me see you do it (do it)
Tat her on your ass, Marshall
And I ain't gonna say pause, Marshall (pause)
I'll get it in blood
For the bitch I love (woo hoo)

[Chorus]
Look what they done to me
Look what they done to me
Look what they done to me
Look what they done to me
I'm a motherfucking loser, failure
Loser
I'm a motherfucking loser, failure
Loser, failure

[Outro]
Look what they done to me
Look what they done to me
Look what they done to me
Look what they done to me
