[Intro: Young Miles]
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Bitches and ho-ass niggas, the weirdo is back
I want e'rybody right now to put yo' blunts up
You're now listenin' to Bizarre's solo album, the "Hannicap Circus"
And I'm your boy Young Miles the Future
And my man's about to get it crackin' for y'all
The band has a new lead singer, everybody stand up
Put your motherfuckin' hands up for the number one weirdo
Bizarre!

[Bizarre]
Heyyy bitch! It's your nigga with the shower cap
Kickin a nasty, dirty filthy rap
DETROIT'S ON THE MAP - and D12's back
Any nigga pop shit, get his ass smacked (what?)
I got two lesbians, full blown AIDS (eww)
Twenty bucks, you can get yo' ass laid
Welcome to Detroit, where the city is cold
Where niggas ride on potholes and fuck up they 24's
Come to Belle Isle where niggas drinkin Brew
Where Osh Kosh, stays open at two
7 Mile and Stout is where you'll find me (yeah)
Or downtown, where it's gritty and grimy
Detroit, the home of the trick hoes
Monte Carlos, smokin' gans by the O's
But if you want weed, holla at my man
7 Mile, the home of strawberry gans

[Bizarre - singing]
Detroit is in the house and I thought I let you knowwww
We smokin gans and got the greens, by the OOOOO's
This is 3-1-3 and I thought I would let you knowwww
Detroit to East side to West side nigga, let's go! {*echoes*}
