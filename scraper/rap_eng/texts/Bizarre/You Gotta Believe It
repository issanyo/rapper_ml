[Intro:]
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out
It's the last song on the album
Friday night at St. Andrews
Hahaha
Imma leave y'all with some positives
They say I'm always negative
Haha
Pay your dues man
Hard-work pays off and reach for the stars
You can make it

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
If you believe then you can achieve
Just ask and you shall receive
And I shall proceed to rock the mic
Hip Hop shop every Saturday night
You wanna be a rapper, dreams of being an engineer
Grab some equipment, buy you some gear
Go to guitar center on your next pay day
You can't afford it,put it on layaway
That's what I say, it's called paying dues
Fuck a new watch, fuck buying some new shoes (Fuck that)
Here's what you do, invest in your self
Stand up, have some respect for your self
You wanna be like Dr. Dre or Hi-Tek
A couple of years, you ain't quite there yet
Just believe, my nigga just believe
Just ask and you shall receive
D-Twizzy

[Hook: Monica Blaire]
Ask and you shall receive
Yes
You gotta believe it
You gotta pound that pavement
Work those stations in rotation
Ask and you shall receive
Yes
But you gotta believe it
It's all about you
What you gon' do
What you gon' do

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
You wanna be famous, get a lot of cheddar
There's a million rappers
What makes you better
Freestyle? Is that all you gon' gimme?
What about writing a verse? Working on your delivery
How many battles you been in? How many shows you rocked?
And I don't give a fuck'bout how many Glocks you bought
This is Hip-Hop, we're all tryna sell
And all real gangstas are dead or in jail
You got a dream, your dream is rapping
Now what you gon do to make this happen?
Go to New York and look for the AML
Go to Shade45 tell em you know Bizarre
Be like Bone Thugs and bust up to Cleveland
Homeless in L.A barely out there eating
This ain't all in vain man,I feel your pain
Before the sunshine, there's always rain


[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
You wanna emcee but you got no bucks
You got no money and you're damn near a vault (damn)
Homeless in L.A, nowhere to stay
Greyhound ticket, leaves on Monday
But don't leave yet, reach for the clouds
You might see Jimmy Iovine, you might run into Kevin Laws
Be proud, hold your head high (stand up)
At the end of the day, you can say you tried
Get in a rap battle, drop a nigga head
Hit him with punchlines, make sure he dead
Go to shady records, stand on the curb
Wait all day for Paul Rosenberg
And if he say no, come back tomorrow (Fuck It)
Bust a freestyle, let him feel sorrow
If you belive then you can anchieve
Just ask and you shall receive
D-Twizzy

[Hook]

[Outro: Monica Blaire]

(Ad Libs)
Don't give up, it's all about you
What you gonna do
