[Proof]
Pah pow!
Straight off the coral
Now the Dirtiest street vet from the Mile
Incest without the Texas six-shooter
Body-bullet polluter
Perverted intruder
Now who the fuck wanna buck with the disease
That's diss eased
I got a bitch named trigger
My main squeeze will make your brain freeze
Dirty D. is dope like cane trees

[Eye-Kyu]
Remain eased
Maintain chill status with no pause
Hug slugs hit your cabbage
And turn your dome to coleslaw
My only thought of survival before my arrival
I'm jumpin' out on niggas like I'm 5-0
Smack 'em up like a pack o' trifle and fly hoes
Any opportunity to mangle I never pass up
Fuckin' your clique with broomsticks
Face down ass up
Dirty Dozen packin' the shit
To turn your chest red
With that dick in your mouth, fuckin' everything you just said

[Eminem]
Yeah yeah bitch
Comin' to a block near you is Dirty Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with 30 husbands
When I was five I was already fuckin'
And playin' X-Rated cassettes
With Teddy Ruxpin
I used to walk up and down the block cussin'
Locked in youth homes at 6 for Glock bustin'
I grew up with knot ballers who got dollars
Shot callers with guns and rottweilers

[Bizarre]
By any means necessary I'm on a killing spree
It's the devil in me
Intoxicated with wild Hennessy
Beware life ain't fair and I don't care
Cher braids my hair while her kids are in day care
Two blunts and I'm out for lunch
You're worse than I'm a sugar pie honey bunch
Diss Bizarre Kid, that ain't the answer
You're more uncomfortable than an anorexic cat with fuckin' cancer

[Hook] (4x)
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants

[Bizarre]
Locked in the studio boy
I don't wanna mingle
Smokin' LSD workin' on Lou Roff's new single
Who's the big guy that's quick like Sugar Ray
Fuck Calgon bitch
Bizarre might take you away
Give up the pussy, 'cuz I know youz a freak
Replacin' your hamster in a week
Cuz my crew's gots to eat
Date rapin' anorexic girls in my beat up car

[Bugz]
(Hold up, Bizarre!  You're takin' that shit too far!)

[Bizarre]
But I can't stop cuz my will ain't there...

[Eminem]
Bust a nut and dump that bitch in Lake St. Clair
Your mistakes ain't rare
Your rap style annoys
You rhyme like a bitch, plus I can't stand your voice
Bitch you suck, you whack as fuck
Eat a dick, you need a brick upside your dome
We be the clique runnin' you down in carloads
Leavin' you smashed on tar roads
Flat line like bar codes

[Eye-Kyu]
Put up your guard hoes
I'm blazing heat the way we speak
Not even Nike could cover these amazing feats
Burning rappers eternally
Internally and externally
For half steppin' like one-legged fraternities
Quick draw McGraw
B.K.A. Eye-kyu
Puttin' something inside you
Leavin' holes that I see right through
For anyone obstructing my view
My order of attack
These slugs to your chest that'll blow your heart out your back
Makin' sure you get fed with a whole lot of lead
Then throw you off of the Ambassador Bridge
And scream "DROP DEAD"

[Proof]
Largely I'm out to stack equations
Without a tax evasion
With mossy that's amazin'
All the same like black and asian
My pack evasion attack a stage and roll plush like a Cadillac
I wish your fleet would try to battle rap
Would make a man bleed
Like a cattle pack stampede
Frontin' cosign my hands bleed
Think they recognize like Sam Sneed
My drug ain't dispose ya
Fold ya couldn't (*BLAM*)
Another classic closure
The death master out to blast ya
My team run shit from the deep East Side
Down to Lasher, past the - norm
My group swarm
Molest the children of the corn
Dirty D til infinity now bring it on

[Hook (4x) + Outro]
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants (Bitch!)
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
You motherfuckers can die
Aiiyo, I shake the world... yes yes, yes yes
