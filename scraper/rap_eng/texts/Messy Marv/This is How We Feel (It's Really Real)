[Verse 1: San Quinn]
Now why a nigga wanna die? This ain't a movie
Pull up in a Magnum, totin' on the chop suey
Tell everybody you want it wit' me
Confronted wit' me, you don't want nothin' wit' me
Different strokes, niggas know, Fil' drummin' wit' me
Standin' there, all scared, in a puddle of pee
TV Rap City, not America's most
It's the place for me, I'm still carryin' totes
Instead of stayin' 'round war, bullets'll downpour
You ain't wit' the shit, what you hangin' around for?
Hot ones hit nigga we don't graze
And we slide through ya block throwin' hand grenades

[Chorus: Husalah]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Sometimes I really wonder why
These punks runnin' they mouth
It's like they wanna die, 'cause a nigga stay fly
We fuckin' wit' the shit, niggas mobstas
You all on my dick, scared to death when I pop up
'Cause I been the same, grind in the rain, shells out my thang
Fuckin' wit' a tough it's stupid real
Niggas really real, livin' in that Fil', this is how we feel

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Don't want heroin in my veins on one leg like a crane
In the Lex' tacked out tryna smoke my thoughts away
They point ya fitted cap out, I can take ya thoughts away
I'll probably look you in your eyes, squeeze then turn and walk away
'Cause that's the usual method, that a mobsta selected
Been robbin' niggas for breakfast, don’t fight, just enhance it
My niggas dancin' wit cannons, extortin' niggas wit' hammas
You filmin' hood to hood 2? Then get this shit on camera
All the shit I been through, surprised I still got manners
One love to all my niggas doin' life in the slammer
Hus' when you get out the pen you come home to a Phantom
'Cause I'm still hittin' banks wit' the tan bandana

[Chorus: Husalah]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Sometimes I really wonder why
These punks runnin' they mouth
It's like they wanna die, 'cause a nigga stay fly
We fuckin' wit' the shit, niggas mobstas
You all on my dick, scared to death when I pop up
'Cause I been the same, grind in the rain, shells out my thang
Fuckin' wit' a tough it's stupid real
Niggas really real, livin' in that Fil', this is how we feel
Bitch!

[Verse 3: Messy Marv]
He a murda man? Bet a nigga get straight
Call that nigga that love you to take them shells out ya face
I'm on that Grey Goose nigga, snortin' that gun powder
I'll slap ya bitch nigga and punk ya lil' patna
I'm a user cus cus, and I bang this click clack
Holdy truck on them Davin's, street bike on a bidnak
Ridin' on blades, sittin' behind tents
Wit' a bad black bitch nigga smokin' on piss
I'm a gangsta, mind come from the game nigga
I used to sell fifty's and hustle in the rain nigga
If a bitch ain't talkin' 'bout hoein' I keep goin'
Ride by in somthin' runnin', with the AC blowin'
Feel that

[Chorus: Husalah] 
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Sometimes I really wonder why
These punks runnin' they mouth
It's like they wanna die, 'cause a nigga stay fly
We fuckin' wit' the shit, niggas mobstas
You all on my dick, scared to death when I pop up
'Cause I been the same, grind in the rain, shells out my thang
Fuckin' wit' a tough it's stupid real
Niggas really real, livin' in that Fil', this is how we feel
Bitch!

[Verse 4: Husalah]
Yo, yo, yo, It's young Husalah, bitch
He never had a girlfriend but he love that girl
He love the way she switch and move
Her complexion and pearl
His own pops used to toot that boy
That's why her son came out womb mainy as fuck shootin' that boy
Stuck to the spot, nonstop coupes and toys
Sweatsuits with the big red and blue F
All this stupid fresh sure I ain't gon' housing a single rooster boy
This is a life you ain't used to, 'noid is what these suckas be
When they see the MOB and me, molly woppin' on 6's
Top down in the seven-three Caprice, nigga play my beat
Hear the stupid freaks, listen to the super freak Rick James
On 15's blappin' up the block bitch

[Chorus: Husalah]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Sometimes I really wonder why
These punks runnin' they mouth
It's like they wanna die, 'cause a nigga stay fly
We fuckin' wit' the shit, niggas mobstas
You all on my dick, scared to death when I pop up
'Cause I been the same, grind in the rain, shells out my thang
Fuckin' wit' a tough it's stupid real
Niggas really real, livin' in that Fil', this is how we feel (this is how we feel)
