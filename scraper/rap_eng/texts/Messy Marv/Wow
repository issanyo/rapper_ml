I'm felling like new money if i look in da mirror
I see a $ everyday is a hustle for me i gotta grind
I'm like you i need that truck on 24's a lot of gunz
Big purple and plenty close yea this is the life
On my block kid flosss told me i don't need no chain
I can rock his, naw bruh i need it just for now
I got this HO outside
I'm trying to sit her down
I'm a hustler even if i was blind i see scratch
Rubber band Snapped around 100 G stacks
I still feel like a Mill
In a safe all crispy hundred dollar bills
Dinner plates for Everybody we all go'n eat
N***** wanna hate on us we all go'n beef
It ain't no hanging if you ain't banging
Abide by the rules ether live like G
Or die like a Fool
