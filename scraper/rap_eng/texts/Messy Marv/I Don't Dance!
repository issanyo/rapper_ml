[Messy Marv]
I'm ten hundreds on these niggas, little iron fangers
In the back of the club with the gangbangers
Canaries in my watch with them Bathing Apes
Doin my body like this, workin my thizz face
I'm ballin, why would I fuck with a ripper
Tryin to hit Magic City, I'm in love with a stripper
Drinkin that silver, up all night
On them green mack, dressed in them yellow and blue Nikes
Uh-huh, once again it's on
She tryin to take a few flicks for her camera phone
Yeah, pretty lips, cute face
I'ma go on and make her famous nigga on MySpace like

[Chorus]
I don't dance, I do my body like this
I'm a koon, you ain't never met nobody like this..
I don't dance, I do my body like this
I'm a koon, you ain't never met nobody like this

[Messy Marv]
I'm fifty 20's on these niggas, little ICI
I rock that real jewelry, them icy rocks
It's diamonds in my urr, diamonds in my necklace
Yeah, orange juice and a blunt for breakfast
What'chu know 'bout them Lambo do's?
Escort bitches, nigga marble on flo's
Runnin from the papparazzi
I'm a million dollar nigga like DiBiase
Uh-huh, lil' homey I'm a plurr
At the airport, nigga jumpin off a Lurr
Yeah, you know your boy pop tags
I be barkin off the marble like 50 11 bags

[Chorus]

[Messy Marv]
Yeah, I do my body like this
Like this (like this) like this (like this)
Yeah, I do my body like this
Like this (like this) like this (like this) uh-huh
Yeah, I do my body like this
Like this (like this) like this (like this)
Yeah, I do my body like this
Like this (like this) like this (like this)

[Chorus] - 2X
