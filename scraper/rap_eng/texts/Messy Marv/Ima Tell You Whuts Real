[Intro: Messy Marv]
What's happenin'?
Ay, check this out
I'ma tell you what's real man
You know what I mean
I don't need your baby daddy callin' my phone and shit
After the club, that's old
Put my name in your phone number
I mean, pfft, my phone number in your name
You know what I mean

[Verse 1: Messy Marv]
I'ma walkin' bank roll
Niggas hatin' on the low
Talkin' 'bout me, see these bitches
Whatchu' sayin' that for?
(Silver in my glass)
Nigga, get off, what you mad at?
I heard cane Katrina on them bitches, they can have that
Five-hundred shots of Patron, so I'm grabin' that
Got that dope dick for them hoes, they ain't had that
I'm a goon, they don't ever put me on the guest list
Tell me if we fuckin', bitch, cause I don't do the texts
I can do the Charger and I can do the Lexus
We can do the waffle house, bitch and do the breakfast
Shorty, I ball, like everyday Christmas
Fours on everything, fuck some dig ditches
I'ma tell you what's real
Shorty, put that thing on
Lemme' see how that feel
You know the kid don't dance
I'm a millionaire G
Ten-five for a beat, shorty drinks on me
Me

[Hook: Messy Marv]
She know the kid don't dance
I'm fresh out the joint
I got to sag my pants
I'm rollin'
I'ma tell you what's real
Silver in my glass and I bet it don't spill
(Silver in my glass)
Bitch, I work a gold grill
(Silver in my glass)
Bitch, I turn a wood wheel
(Silver in my glass)
I'm from the land of the treal
Shorty, put that thang on me
Lemme see how that feel

[Verse 2: Messy Marv]
If you niggas really wanna fuck with the business
Tell a nigga 'bout it, stop talkin' to these bitches
When all you niggas see me on them twenty-four inches
Blowin' through this motherfucker suckin' on citris
I'm 'bout to spend some money on these hoes, it's all gravy
When I hit the dance floor, them bitches went crazy
Silver in my glass and I bet it don't spill
How you make your ass move and your waist stay still
I'm D-boy fresh, I do my body like this
All I kept vision is me and this bitch
In the back of that shit, in the floor of that Volvo
And the room service in the mornin' at the mo-mo
(Silver in my glass)
I'ma tell you what's real
Shorty put that thing on me
Lemme see how that feel
You know the kid don't dance
I'm a millionaire G
Ten-five for a beat, shorty drinks on me
Me

[Hook: Messy Marv]
She know the kid don't dance
I'm fresh out the joint
I got to sag my pants
I'm rollin'
I'ma tell you what's real
Silver in my glass and I bet it don't spill
(Silver in my glass)
Bitch, I work a gold grill
(Silver in my glass)
Bitch, I turn a wood wheel
(Silver in my glass)
I'm from the land of the treal
Shorty, put that thang on me
Lemme see how that feel

[Bridge: Messy Marv]
I smoke on pussy, [?]
Shorty jump in the coupe and let me smear your  mascara
My heart pump liquor, I'm goin' out the fun way
Seven days a week, shorty, even on Sunday
I smoke on pussy, [?]
Shorty jump in the coupe and let me smear your  mascara
My heart pump liquor, I'm goin' out the fun way
Seven days a week, shorty, even on Sunday

[Hook: Messy Marv]
She know the kid don't dance
I'm fresh out the joint
I got to sag my pants
I'm rollin'
I'ma tell you what's real
Silver in my glass and I bet it don't spill
(Silver in my glass)
Bitch, I work a gold grill
(Silver in my glass)
Bitch, I turn a wood wheel
(Silver in my glass)
I'm from the land of the treal
Shorty, put that thang on me
Lemme see how that feel
