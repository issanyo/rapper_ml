[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Duh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh
What happened to the world is my biggest question
What happened to the cuddie Furl was the biggest lesson
Up the block sideways through the intersection
Seem just like yesterday we was in the session
What you know 'bout holdin' it down with a weapon?
I don't think you do, the words from Never Blink was true
Now sink deep me and you, that's eye and eye
I was high in smoke too thick to see through
Cloud my brain, I was barely sane
Nigga shit ain't really been the same, since I been a grown mane
Shoulda got an education, only got myself to blame
Gettin' older every day, tryna smoke away the pain
Gunshot, one shot (blaow), I can see his brain (blaow)
I can't see his face no more, I don't feel a thing

[Chorus: Messy Marv]
I don't just rap about it nigga this is my life
And the game was my bitch 'til I made her my wife
Nigga this the mob for life, for life, for life
I don't just rap about it nigga this is my life
And the game was my bitch 'til I made her my wife
Nigga this the mob for life, for life, for life

[Verse 2: San Quinn]
But still I gotta get over
Why settle for a pebble 'stead of holdin' a boulder
Not a shoulder to weep on
A mattress to sleep on
The night life and havin' money made me leave home
Played in my face and told me toon was smooth
Who do you run wit'? Usually fools
In love wit' a gangsterish nature but came out first
In love wit' bad habits money was my first
He's young, he's black, you know his life
Cookin' crack in the jar, growin' weed under lights
Read me my rights, cuff and enslave me
'Cause I'm shady is the nation that made me
Gotta get a coin, pushin' in a tenderloin
Steam rollin' competition so you better join
From Hunter's Point, Fillmore to the 'Lo
We kill for what reason? We do not know
Homicides outside wit' the swat unit

[Chorus: Messy Marv]
I don't just rap about it nigga this is my life
And the game was my bitch 'til I made her my wife
Nigga this the mob for life, for life, for life
I don't just rap about it nigga this is my life
And the game was my bitch 'til I made her my wife
Nigga this the mob for life, for life, for life

[Verse 3: Husalah]
It's cops and cocaine on my block in my face
'Cause all official dudes just gang bang on MySpace
I caught a federal charge, it made my mind race
Five straight in the Feds and camp time in outer space
Floatin' in my SL500, I ride blunted
Wit' no smoke in the air, top down and the trunk stuntin'
Now this is real life, so don't confuse nothin'
I make pumps hot for months when the Hus' is dumpin'
They glorify the life, but they ain't pumpin' nothin'
Get traumatized and sodomized wit' the pump when the Hus' is dumpin'
Blue steel, true skill wit' this mob shit
The GOP had me brainwashed at 13 I was robbin'
Top shottin' and batchi boys chops rockin'
Sweat suits shockin', top droppin', I'm cold cockin'
And I swear to God, on my life that's the true shit
Put that on God, if you fake this ain't for you bitch

[Chorus: Messy Marv]
I don't just rap about it nigga this is my life, my life, my life
And the game was my bitch 'til I made her my wife
Nigga this the mob for life, for life, for life
I don't just rap about it nigga this is my life, my life, my life
And the game was my bitch 'til I made her my wife
Nigga this the mob for life, for life, for life

[Verse 4: Messy Marv]
I was born to get money and hug this corner
I got a bad bitch but I don't want her
Tryna pimp on her man and sit her down in Pamona
Do it movin' homie and sit her ass down in Tacoma
Tryna cash out
These bitch ass niggas donâ€™t want me to pull a mask out
Run in they pockets nigga right in front of the crack house, yeah
Mob Figga nigga number six
Young Mess and lil' silver blocks and let them birds pop
They talk about it but I don't think these niggas want it
See you whippin' in traffic, I'll push up on it yeah
They talk about it but I don't think these niggas want it
See you whippin' in traffic, I'll push up on it
This the mob nigga

[Chorus: Messy Marv]
I don't just rap about it nigga this is my life, my life, my life
And the game was my bitch 'til I made her my wife
Nigga this the mob for life, for life, for life
I don't just rap about it nigga this is my life, my life, my life
And the game was my bitch 'til I made her my wife
Nigga this the mob for life, for life, for life
