Yo I see you looking but is it all good
I'm the king of the city, one of them boys in the hood
Dat done did a little time like doughby
She standing there looking at me like "you go boy"
She had on timbs, waistline real skinny
But when she take off her clothes her body real pretty
Would you ride if a nigga could'ntbuy you chanel?
Get you the prada and put the paint on your nails?
Fuck you real good and put you in a coupe
Ballaz spend money like a nigga shooting hoop
I'm just saying shorty I'm livin that lifestyle
New jack city yeah I'm livin that right now
Wanna ride a little something, show me the way
We can jump on a plane and I can show you the bay
And when I locked something down it's usually locked
And they usually get canarys for their jewelry box
Say love Say love Let me talk to you for a moment
Get to know you, let me show you I'm the one you need
Say Love, Say Love, Is it alright if I
Spend some time get you fly cause I wanna make you mine
It's a yadadamean, I'm over 21 I just look 19
Wanna get it poppin I already know
Body telling you yes mind telling you no
I spend 10 thousand on champagne
Them bright yellow stones all in your choke chain
Let's count cash for a livin
Would you hold a nigga down if I was in and out of prison
You know sometimes it get that real
Sometimes you can't bargain gotta take that deal
She had tattoos on her butter soft skin
Bobby valentino for me one time again
Titties like keisha, back bangin like free
Can't tell if I kiss on you ma that ain't me
When I lock something down it's usually locked
And they ususlly get canarys for their jewelry box
Say love Say Love can I talk to you for amoment
Get to know you let me show you I'm the one you need
Say love Say Love is it alright if I
Spend some time, get you fly, cause I wanna make you mine
Baby come and take this ride, My s5 get you fly
Show me all the things you like, I'll do them for you
You won't need no x with me, I'll be all the extasy
That you'll ever need
