Sitting on candy, playin with my nose
Sippin on brandy, playin with my nose
Square bitches can't stand me, playin with my nose

Money ain't a thang, hop out the range, nigga looking for that train nigga, playin with my nose
And if I go to jail I'll be all on my bunk nigga, all in the cell homie playin with my nose

Sitting on candy, playin with my nose
Sippin on brandy, playin with my nose
Square bitches can't stand me, playin with my nose
