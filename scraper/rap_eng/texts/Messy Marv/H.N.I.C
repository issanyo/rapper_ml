[Intro]
The Mekanix...

[Hook: J Stalin]
I'm in the hood pitchin' rocks out my front yard
I'm on the block gettin' guap on the boulevard
While you bitch niggas actin' like broads
I'm H-N-I-C the head nigga in charge

[Verse 1: J Stalin]
Get guap, never hate, never perpetrate
Never listen to what them suckas say, them niggas hella fake
I put the word out, niggas get eliminated
Young Stalin done made it, they damn sure hate it
I used to be broke so I guess I updated
Flirted with the turf, moved hella worth
Purple for dessert, smokin' in Arizona
No matter where ever I'm at I'm hanging on the corner
Lookin' around, checkin' everybody gear
Like yup, I'm the freshest nigga over here (over here)
Trailing the money like a stock broker
Cause when it comes to the coke I'm a share holder
Jesus on my shoulder, one nation under him
Fuck with young Stalin, nigga I'll smother them
Livewire hold the West up like a safety pin
Stalin, Shady and Jay Jonah the fire man

[Hook: J Stalin]
I'm in the hood pitchin' rocks out my front yard
I'm on the block gettin' guap on the boulevard
While you bitch niggas actin' like broads
I'm H-N-I-C the head nigga in charge

[Verse 2: Messy Marv]
The bag weigh a gram, the zip twenty nine
This shit gonna sell and these nigga gonna buy
They sixteen in L.A. tweny four in Chicago
I'm up and down the interstate, indo with the rallo
Thirty round dick in my shit with the hollow
I jump out strapped nigga every where that I go
It's always a drought around Cinco de Mayo
But blood still got 'em for the seventeen five though
I dry cook, I don't put it in the pot
I put it in the microwave and watch it rise to the top (ding!)
Hit it with the ice and make one big cookie
I got the Jackie-O if you niggas want the nookie
The zip come hard, I don't sell my soft
And you ain't gotta fuck with me, I'm a get mine all
Ice cream, seven hundred a pop
Add two more dollars if I gotta make the drop, fuck wit me

[Hook: J Stalin]
I'm in the hood pitchin' rocks out my front yard
I'm on the block gettin' guap on the boulevard
While you bitch niggas actin' like broads
I'm H-N-I-C the head nigga in charge

[Verse 3: J Stalin]
I got cream for the fiends on the dope spot
Rubber band knots, from the coke white
If I don't hustle all day then I don't sleep right
Livewire go, make sure a nigga money right
Plus my whip tight, I'm a hustler
You third string, that means you workin' for the customer
Nigga I blow more smoke than a muffler
Catch you outta pocket I'll be knockin' at your jugular
Home of the brave, more game than a arcade
Work on the turf, got bitches on a blade
Fittin to stack my money up buy me a dropped escalade
Two thousand and eight Benz painted cherry kool-aid
With this snow I'm great, shit I know why they hate
Cause I'm famous in the hood like a Philly cheese steak
And I leave California whenever I take a break
Plus I take my scale so I know what I make

[Hook: J Stalin]
I'm in the hood pitchin' rocks out my front yard
I'm on the block gettin' guap on the boulevard
While you bitch niggas actin' like broads
I'm H-N-I-C the head nigga in charge
