[Verse 1: Messy Marv]
What's up star
I'd like to get to know who you are
Come conversate with Messy Marv
A West Coast playa with the gift of spittin'
Ain't no top notch super bad too major for this
Let's take a toast, come tap your pimpin' with my pimpin'
Paper chasin', fast cars, money, and women
The unforgivin', trife' life is how I'm livin'
Hustlin' with precision, my Fillmore religion
Heads stay spinnin', off in that Lexus coupe
Broads stay grinnin' when the Mess strike through
Not just fly too
They say I'm doin' too much
'Cause I be off of 20 yak, wantin' to touch and stuff
Jiggy take a puff, relax your mind
Let your conscious free
Like Ginuwine, ride on my pony
Hustlas get lonely too
Baby, you bring out the player in me and the freak in you

[Hook]
This is
For the player in you
This is
And me, you gotta stay true
This is
For the hustlas too
This game is gonna last forever

[Verse 2: Messy Marv]
Them suckas ain't lovin' you right
What Pac said, "lonely need a thug in your life"
Call me Mister Messy Mino
Game tight like a casino
Tryin' to have multiple chips, like the Pink Flamingo
Up in Reno, Fetticino, and super bads, that's my stealo
Gang related, drug affiliated like a kilo
I'm off the higgidy, no diggidy
It don't take much to bring out the playa in your niggidy
Capt'n-Save-A, nah nah, that ain't my flavor
I been major, G-bundle knocks on my pager
Ain't that somethin', boy ain't no future in your frontin'
Let's get out the childs play and get to grindin' and bumpin'
Baby, take a puff, relax your mind
Let your conscious free
And like Ginuwine, ride on my pony
Hustlas get lonely too
Baby, you bring out the player in me and the freak in you

[Hook]
This is
For the player in you
This is
And me, you gotta stay true
This is
For the hustlas too
This game is gonna last forever

[Outro]
I love the player in you
You keeps it true (keeps it true)
So much game in between us
With a player like you, I don't need to mess around
I'll be the one to come runnin'
You're blowing my mind with the bomb that you give me
Everyday
Is for the player in you, baby
If you play your cards right
I'll be your lady
Is for the player in you, baby
If you play your cards right
I'll be your lady
