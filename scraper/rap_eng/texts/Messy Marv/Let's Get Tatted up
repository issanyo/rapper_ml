[Verse 1: San Quinn]
Come floss wit' me girl all across the world
Come stand on the block while I toss the pearl
Come to VIP wit' me, them other hoes is peasants
Make ya feel like a million when you're in my presence
Smoke purple, drink Remy XO
We can fuck fast or we can have sex slow
Sideshow Bob ain't doin' the job
Said this square ain't rare as ya gangsta heartthrob
Breakin' ankles carpet so thick in my palace
Donâ€™t be mad when I call you bitch 'cause you the baddest
Titties lookin' pretty, ass lookin' fat enough
You for me, me for you, let's get tatted up

[Verse 2: Messy Marv]
Tell the truth, you ain't never met a nigga like me
I could be ya Dame Dash, could be ya Jay-Z
I'm a product of the block, I need a gangsta bitch
'Cause any time it can jump off into some gangsta shit
You can grab a .45 baby, but first you gotta aim
You can't be game goofy bitch you gotta have game
I need a bitch that's gon' listen and stay in her place
Sexy ass body wit' a pretty ass face
I get locked up on that charge, she up there to see me
I give her that dope dick, she never gon' leave me
Titties lookin' pretty, ass lookin' fat enough
You for me, me for you, let's get tatted up, for real

[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Where you be is where I be
So close, she shadow me
I'll hold you down baby like the laws of gravity
Sneak the heat in the club, .40 cal in the Coach bag
You can holla at them niggas but I own that
Pedicure, manicure, financial secure
For better, for worse, I'm ya nigga for sure

[Verse 4: Messy Marv]
I like 'em Black, White, Chinese, Mexican, Puerto Rican
I'll be in my S-5 on pills baby giggin'
But I'm icy, who colder than me? (huh?)
I got way more game than niggas older than me
Shit, titties lookin' pretty, ass lookin' fat enough
You for me, me for you, let's get tatted up, yeah
