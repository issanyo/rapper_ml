[Verse 1: King Lavish D]
I'm a project nigga yo, I be talking money
I got a white bitch she a million dollar bunny
The banked up boy, I shine like it's sunny
Laughing out loud cause you niggas all funny
If you a broke bitch you can't do shit for me
If you a fake nigga you can't get shit from me
You ain't saying nothing if you ain't talking money
H2 Hummer same color as some honey
Project baby, candy rim Mercedes
Coach interior I did it for the ladies
Red diamond chains on just like Baby
Red bandana on Lavish so brazy
I'm still in the hood, everybody know me
All red Gucci belt, holding up the 40
I'm still in the trap, trapping with my homies
If I don't fuck with you nigga you must be phony
I fuck with real niggas, fuck with real killers
Trap booming all night I fuck with drug dealers
My whole clique certified ain't nobody [?]
Keep it 100 everybody got a feeling

[Chorus]
I'm a project nigga
Project nigga
Project nigga
P-p-project nigga
I-I be talking money
I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I'm a project nigga
Project nigga
Project nigga
P-p-project nigga
I-I be talking money
I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I-I be talking money

[Verse 2: King Lavish D]
I grew up in New Park when I knew about the mobb
I was only 17 tearing up the block
Busting down whole birds selling old rocks
Putting all my niggas on, sewing up the spot
King of the south side, got the streets locked
Selling dope and busting heads, it was me and Pop
2003 that's when my baby Mom got shot
They smoked my nigga Wes and the FBI was hot
I stopped selling dope, and I picked up that [?]
Cracking face masks like I playing for the Raiders
Baskin Robbin guns I got all different flavors
1100 rounds nigga I got it for the haters
TASK kicked in the door and found a couple guns
Canines was everywhere I couldn't even run
No one ever dipped my fingerprints wasn't even on them guns
I just took that 5 years so they wouldn't take my son

[Chorus]
I'm a project nigga
Project nigga
Project nigga
P-p-project nigga
I-I be talking money
I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I'm a project nigga
Project nigga
Project nigga
P-p-project nigga
I-I be talking money
I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I-I be talking money

[Verse 3: King Lavish D]
I'm always in the hood, fucking with my niece
Real my business like my nigga Lil P
Clit 30 round dick hanging out to see
Don't make me leave your whole brain hanging out your wig
I'm taking up the whole lane like a big rig
I really got a mansion, but I've never been on Cribs
I put the steel on your grill like some ribs
He spitting up blood man get this boy a bib
It is what it is I'm from that project housing
Sitting in the trap counting 200,000
Birds on the table stacked up like a mountain
I touched so much money dog I should be an accountant
Player haters frowning I'm the king of the town
Different color diamonds like the clothes on a clown
Don't ever try to play me dog it is how it sounds
1100 guttas Starz up guns down

[Chorus]
I'm a project nigga
Project nigga
Project nigga
P-p-project nigga
I-I be talking money
I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I'm a project nigga
Project nigga
Project nigga
P-p-project nigga
I-I be talking money
I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I'm a project nigga
Project nigga
Project nigga
P-p-project nigga
I-I be talking money
I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I'm a project nigga
Project nigga
Project nigga
P-p-project nigga
I-I be talking money
I be talking money
I-I be talking money
I-I be talking money
