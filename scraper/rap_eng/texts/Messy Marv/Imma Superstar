[Hook]
She wanna campaign, (drink) sip champagne
Fuck my rims, love my chain
I'ma superstar, woah oh oh
Dont kiss me baby you can kiss my chain (2x)

[Verse 1: Messy Marv]
Everytime I come through they see me smokin' on kush
Nigga I put that candy on everything I push
Fresh off the lot I set my shit on sixes
I put the screens in it nigga just for the bitches
Rubberbands on my money star burst on my neck
I said one word and her pussy got wet
A nigga tank empty but I'm drinking champagne
They see me and these bitches wanna all campaign
Fuck a nigga rims and make love to my chain
Drink some of that other shit and smoke cocaine
I ride through slow, sitting up high, there's coochie everywhere
Bitch I'm so fly!

[Repeat Hook:] (2x)

[Verse 2: Messy Marv]
These bitches wanna fuck me cuz my car look sticky
When I was on the bus they didn't wanna fuck with me
Got the coke white pipe in, guts all goochie
With them yokahama skinnies, man that other shit boosie
Soon as I turn the corner, nigga bitches say damn!
Then I YULE, and nigga superman
You can see the shit I got in my ? through the ten
Write the number down shawty hit me on the hip
????? in my grill hella heat in the back
Bitches be like he ballin that nigga done that
I ride through slow, sitting up high, there's coochie everywhere
Bitch I'm so fly!

[Repeat Hook:] (2x)

[Verse 3: Messy Marv]
Don't hop in my car bitch if you don't smoke
They be like is you gon' let me drive your escalade, NO!
These hoes ain't never been around real money
I'ma superstar bitch, your boyfriend a crash dummy
My chain hang all the way down to my dick
So many flu stones, I can make a bitch sick
Trina got ass and Tameika so thick
But all these bitches wanna do is fuck a nigga whip
The hoes come to me I don't chase nah bitch
Holla at me shawty you know I keep it lit
I ride through slow, sitting up high, there's coochie everywhere
Bitch I'm so fly!

[Repeat Hook:] (2x)
