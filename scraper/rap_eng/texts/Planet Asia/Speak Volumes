[Intro: Mike Tyson]
Everyone says, “I wish I was in your shoes, I wish I was in your shoes.”
The hundreds of people that wish they were in my shoes don’t know the tenth of it
If they were in my shoes, they would cry like babies

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh-huh, yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, uh
Drug-related raps, criminal cloth king
Physique lord projection, cyber money mafia
Mystique kush [?], A1 leaf chief
[?] at [?], mystery mix, memory mobster
My international brand is outstanding
Bags is Bigfoot, didn’t know it was this good what I was planning
Apollo and Planet business meetings and pink salmon
Don't bother yourself, we gladly serve beef patties
Forced me to mark your face, I thought I told you never ever let me see you tryna pull up in my parking space
Blowout shirts, wise guy gadgets and clerks
What I tell you about tryna sell on my turf, chump?
Black belter, airline Delta
Foam metal poms is on again, tell the squad to meet me at the bomb shelter
The streets featuring the face of death, brace your steps
Stay so I can freeze the final safety net

[Hook]
The opposite of weak, what I speak is power
Won’t drop ‘til it’s complete, need at least an hour
Drop it in the streets, and the streets is ours
‘Cause everything we do seems to speak in volumes
The opposite of weak, what I speak is power
Won’t drop ‘til it’s complete, need at least an hour
Drop it in the streets, and the streets is ours
‘Cause everything we do seems to speak in volumes

[Verse 2]
Styles is beyond, my wave cut strictly for the intellectual thugs
And jailhouse imams, therapeutic drug use, melody
We them babies from the seventies, proud of my sleeve, flawless and felony
Beautiful like all of my seeds, onomato-grees, the trinity is all that I need
And my circumference peach, the realest known for killer zone to silicone
This shit I'm on can get a nice slice to sit us on
No time to politic with the petty, that's deadly
I never bit the hand that fed me, that's settlin'
I don't involve myself with the [?] because that's meddlin'
I played a cup with my peeps and sleep in the reach of my weapon
This ain't a action flick, it's just the story of a kid out of poverty tryna find a way to stack some chips
The streets featuring the face of death, brace your steps, my hustle is my safety net

[Hook]
The opposite of weak, what I speak is power
Won’t drop ‘til it’s complete, need at least an hour
Drop it in the streets, and the streets is ours
‘Cause everything we do seems to speak in volumes
The opposite of weak, what I speak is power
Won’t drop ‘til it’s complete, need at least an hour
Drop it in the streets, and the streets is ours
‘Cause everything we do seems to speak in volumes

[Outro]
Yeah, it's that mixture right here, man
It's how we get busy
Know what I mean?
