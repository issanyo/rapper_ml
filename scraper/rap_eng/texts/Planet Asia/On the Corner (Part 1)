[Planet Asia]
Ah huh ah huh ah huh ah huh ah huh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You don't stop what, what what what what (What is that shit?)
What what what what
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (It's that Asia shit)
Uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh
Uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh

Total concentration, space provided
Give me room to ignite
My body gestures got my brain feelin excited
Settin the formats silent now comprehend this
Universal Yard president
Presentation, all around the earth you feel us lingering
This be the cold shit of course
Cuz I was forced by the streets to rock beats and sell Source
On the avenue, posted like all in your grill
And plus connect the ghetto sections like "What, ya'll wanna build?"
From out the Yard, massive squadron camoflagued in a page
Pass the margin on the paper where the science is staged
I strike like a python, it's the dominant intelligent lifeform
I shine like walkin wit the lights on
Make you forget about what you heard when my mic's on
I write songs for the cats on the corner wit the Nikes on
Dusk till dawn, dawn till dusk
I will forever represent the Yard Massive, final dynast-indeed
That's true and livin out the actual seed of my daddy's sperm
Came firm once he shot me on the ovaries
I flow degrees overseas
Over these beats, foreign touring MC, my mind state keeps maturing
I bounce off beats like basketballs on wooden floors
My freestyle's foul once cats try to score shots while
Wizard wit words, makin sure my shit's the sureshot
Heard throughout the sector, making heads want more
The Yard Massive microphonist on a worldwide tour
Tour, tour, tour, tour

[Chorus] 2x
Yo, I'm here to set it on ya, direct from California
Central Valley Agent, Planet Asia's on the corner
Lettin it be known that when it comes to the squad
Mega serious to be the most interesting involved

(We need another blunt man)
