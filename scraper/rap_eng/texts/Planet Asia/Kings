[Intro]
Last night at Staples Center our next guest kept an improbable
Post season run with a decisive victory in their franchise history
Their long victory party begins right here, on our stage night
Please welcome your new champion: the Los Angeles Kings!

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Yeah, yo
English man spliff, a cup of henny, feel me, I'm blithe
I'm in my zone, stoned, Al Capone, ready to spit
This is science, breaker 1-2, roger that
Hear the beat slapping, watch the God
Crush it like a giant witch doctor
Annunaki, sushi and sake, praise the mafi'
I split 'em with ice, this is black hockey
Styling and wilding, profiling, who can flow better
Palm springs, sticking nigga's up in pore cheddar
Knowledge supreme, Elohim, true and living in the flesh
So I didn't have to follow a dream, this is in me
Mixtape blend, be first, verbal semi burst
Cause most of these feminin rap niggas is trendy
On four corners of the earth heard a trumpet
Was more fertile once the drums started 'tumping
Black angels, I told you to honour my posse
I rap cocky, smash a track up, black hockey

[Hook 2x]
*Heaven or hell, that's where my homies went*
*Gangsters, hustlers, pimps, follow me*
*Suckers pumping up, I'm 'bout to tape one, breaks on*
*That's me, the king, the mc!*

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Extraordinary grimy cut, 1991, Mighty Ducks
Chasing void, face split craniums with a shiny buck
Ante up, you're next to an asshole like a tranny nuts
I'm disrespectful, drink mojito's out the Stanley Cup
Los Angeles King, no opposition stop a man from his dream
Won't abandon his team, now, stand in the ring
Or skate in the rink, and this still just war games
But you're chasing defeat, my soul on ice was in Calgary Flames
Cause I represent C-arson, that's the city I claim
I crucify rappers, give 'em cavalry pain
Like Christ y'all nigga's suffer 'til my salary change
Me out the penalty box? Yo, that'll be strange
I'm like Wayne Gretzky, we're departing and fading
A platinum chain, iced out roley
Til no goalie can block me, this is black hockey

[Hook 2x]
