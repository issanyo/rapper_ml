[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Niggas out here making classics and shit
Authentic shit
Grimy, dirty, and dangerous
Its like cookies and angel dust
Smell it through the package
I can sell it 'cause its cracking
Or like my damu would say, "Its brackin'"
The op got in my scope and I blapped him
Stop frontin' ya'll cowards ain't trappin'
True talent, new balance
Few gallons, Cognac island
We gon' act violent
Rest in peace my grandpoppa sneak
My bloodline from Flint to the fuckin' D
Sip your cup of tea
You're out your mind if you think that you could fuck with me
I press lines like I'm trying to iron
Ya'll still playing, must not be tired of dying
I ain't losing none of mine
I'm the one to find that'll gladly discipline you with this lil gun of mine
Niggas always take the weird route
After I popped their veneers out
I'm the one you always hear 'bout
Stupid rounds that'll make you motherfuckers clear out

[Hook: Planet Asia]
They say I'm dope, they say I'm ill
They say I'm tough, they say I'm real
But they never tell you how I feel

They say I'm dope, they say I'm ill
They say I'm tough, they say I'm real
But they never tell you how I feel

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
Stop running up on me as if we shared a sandwich
Just cause I met you one time don't mean you know the planet
Naw I respect my supporters but use some common sense
After the show is over I ain't trying to spit
I'm trying to sit my old ass down, chill and roll a spliff
Get something to eat, go to sleep, wake up and split
But you wanna talk my ear off, breath smelling like Smirnoff
Make a rapper wanna take a year off
I fantasize about the couch at the house
Remote control cable shows, HBO
I think my back is out
The pain is sciatic, do anything just to combat it
Ok ok, I guess I'll stay and blaze with the fanatics
I'm a real trooper, used to be an ill hooper
But now its 21 and hash blocks through the hookah
I'm the one you always hear 'bout
Stupid smoke that'll make you motherfuckers clear out

[Hook: Planet Asia]
They say I'm dope, they say I'm ill
They say I'm tough, they say I'm real
But they never tell you how I feel

They say I'm dope, they say I'm ill
They say I'm tough, they say I'm real
But they never tell you how I feel

[Outro: Planet Asia]
I'll tell you how I feel
A lot of these niggas is whack, ya know what I'm saying
Straight like that, lotta watered down shit out there know what I'm saying
Yeah
Stop giving credit to that weak shit
