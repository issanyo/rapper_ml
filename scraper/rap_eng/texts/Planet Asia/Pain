[Intro]
I can't believe that I even have to write some this like this man
Was just with me the other day
All y'all

[Verse 1]
Too many beefs, too many murders
Too much money for the funeral service
Everybody's hard, everybody's tough
Everybody's gang but I don't give a fuck
Wish I could bring my loved ones back
I could give one of my lungs for that, even a couple fingers
My little brother told me he nothing but a goon
Shit ain't been the same since they killed my cousin Loon
Nice with his hands, his strength was like a old-ass man
Probably could've been a boxer with a chance
That's fucked up, really though
Last time I seen him was my "Chocolate Milk" video
Can't believe I'm saying this shit, it's like a neverending nightmare
Families get hurt when niggas can't take ass whoopings and fight fair
My cousin got shot in the face
And what's even worse, my other cousin died in the same place

[Chorus]
I can't take no mo', I can't take it (So much pain)
I can't take no mo', I can't take it
I can't take no mo', I can't take it
I can't take no mo', I can't take it
I can't take no mo', I can't take it (So much pain)
I can't take no mo', I can't take it
I can't take no mo', I can't take it
I can't take no mo', I can't take it

[Verse 2]
If it ain't one thing, then it's another
Just left the doctors with my grandmother
She's standing strong but I lost my aunt
My uncle holding in the pain, God bless his heart
Life is short but love is forever
The bond of the family is how you get it together
Relatives hitting me, I'm scared to call 'em back
Cried like a baby when my momma had that heart attack
Lost my cousin [?], I was devastated
Probably one of the reasons why I'm always medicated
Man I gotta escape, got a lot on my plate
Believe in higher powers but I am not of the fate
I hope you hearing me, them devils fearing me
What if I told you that cancer's a conspiracy
I lost two aunts back to back the same week
Rest in peace to my cousin [?] who died in [?]

[Chorus]
I can't take no mo', I can't take it (So much pain)
I can't take no mo', I can't take it
I can't take no mo', I can't take it
I can't take no mo', I can't take it
I can't take no mo', I can't take it (So much pain)
I can't take no mo', I can't take it
I can't take no mo', I can't take it
I can't take no mo', I can't take it

[Outro]
Rest in peace to my cousin [?]
All my loved ones lost
