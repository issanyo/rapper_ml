[Intro: will.i.am]
Y'all, y'all, ain't ready for this
Y'all, ain't ready for this, for
Ev rebahdee, just move your body
Y'all, y'all, ain't ready for this
Y'all, ain't ready for this
Check it out

[Verse 1: Planet Asia (will.i.am)]
Ayo, we straight raw
Make you wile out and break jaws
And break laws from Hollywood Hills to Lake Tahoe
Knock niggas right out the park like baseballs
Lace y'alls slivers of cake, then make more
By the lake shore, thinkin' to myself, "Now what you waitin' for"
We boutta take it all, from here to the great walls
Keep it movin', y'all, just let your backbone slide
And act live, with the soul of the black hand side[?]
With more fire than [?] makin' you bounce
Will, what's the deal? (We in the house, turnin' it out)
On some smash hit rap shit
Nothin' but that phat shit
'Cuz what's a kung-fu flick if it doesn't have backflips?
Fuck that wack shit, get held on a harness
'Cuz we's about to take slots of all you well-known artists
It goes, 1 for the grimey cats, 2 for the tickets, 3 for the dick riders
And the party politic and it's on
Now, everybody in the place get dumb
And have a fake[?], cuz this year we're 'bout to show you where we're coming from
Now, everybody in the place get dumb
And have a fake[?], cuz this year we're 'bout to show you where we're coming from

[Hook: will.i.am (Planet Asia)]
Ev rebahdee, just move your body
(It don't get no bigger than this
All of my people in the house get a little of this)
Feel what I feel
'Cuz I feel sensation
(C'mon, bounce, we 'boutta turn it up a bit
Enough to spit, cuz cats can't touch my clique)

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
When I hit you with ridiculous
Talent, you sit and just
Try to predict my shit, but I'm too inconspicuous
Quick and spontaneous
Crushing, miscellaneous
(?), instantaneous
Will.i.am indigenous
In other words, original
You couldn’t figure this out if I showed you visuals
And blueprints of how we get on and (?)
I got sold like a (?) church with predominantly blacks in the audience
Sorted the ambiance
I killed the beat, that’s why I left up in the ambulance
I do that kinda often to keep these people bouncin’
Bouncin’ up in Boston, and wilin’ out in Austin
Continental crossin’, visitin’ your blocks and
Villages, (?), the meaning of the (?)
Got all of your people just bouncin’ to the beat
(?) Planet Asia here to (?) y’all to move your feet

[Hook: will.i.am (Planet Asia)]

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
You know it’s time to bounce when the beat bang
Equivalent to how you sweatin’ when the heat came
Ain’t no competin’ with will.i.am’s thang
You could pull a hamstring
(?) like the flame and then burn like propane
And stay cool like Kool and the Gang
I remain a main brain in the campaign
How many people doin’ the same thing
Too many R&B chicks who can’t sing
Too many shooters with no ammo
Might change the rules to this damn game
For now, and I’ll be speedin’ in the slow lane
Runnin’ over brothas in my soul train
Nope, I ain’t got no shame
Yep, I’d be the brotha to blame
Mash up in the club and in the show, mane
And I keep my beats tight like fat women in small planes
Heh, that’s exactly how I’m doin’ it
How we be doin’ it
This is how we be doin’ it
Yep, yep, we doin’ it
