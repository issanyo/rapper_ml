[Intro]
Somebody oughta clear this place out once in a while
Smell of dead fish and stale beerâ€™s beginning to attract hungry cats

Smell that? Man
Uh, yeah it's what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout man
Shit be so dirty if you threw water at it, it'd turn to mud
Haha, it's what it is dog
This shit ain't for everybody man
Sayin' tho
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Fuck around and get your face melted
One shot the whole place felt it
Niggas ain't tough, they timid
A bunch of suckers, I'm on my double-up
Hustle my game duffle
Pockets stick like Oprah and the color purple
The universe is mental
So if yo ass is broke then God is trying to tell you something
I'm in the mix for the chips, skip the politics
Mimosas bottomless, this that rile up shit
Holes and hollow tips, students with scholarships
The target was to leave poverty so I shot at it
You know the motto: dead prezzies, pounds of pescado
Relaxin' in my killer condo, uh
It took me days and nights for this
Be on the low in real time, my way of life is rich
I'm not a phony artist, so much fugaziness going on
These clowns got me feelin' like I'm the only artist

[Hook x 2]
Don't get your panties in a jumble
You're killed for being a bitch, playin' in the jungle
We gettin' rich, staying on the bundles
And I know that some of ya'll be hating on the under

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Leaf roller, fly niggas soldier, do it to death
My fleet colder, your feet colder
My heat's loaded, it's psychology
It's like I gotta keep at the goons as I hit beast mode and
Don't be a rat, me and my dudes eat rodents
Me being black my life you couldn't decode it
My pockets sock it too, I'm a warrior like Shaka Zu
Screamin' on niggas like Popa Wu
Peace to the son of man
We in the lands stackin' grams in rubber bands
This thug life is government
Side hustles is needed, why must Obombs get defeated
Fuck around in the slums with the heathens
Shots, polka dots or Caesar, I smoke a lot of cheeba
Just to bury my evils, swim in the Veuve Clicquot
Word to the cathedral, I got rellies ready to rumble
These feddy bundles got your panties in a jumble

[Hook x 2]
Don't get your panties in a jumble
You're killed for being a bitch, playin' in the jungle
We gettin' rich, staying on the bundles
And I know that some of ya'll be hating on the under

[Outro]
Know what I'm sayin'
For all the motherfuckers that wanna know
We don't fall off, we fall on
Don't be so fucking mad though when you see us
Know what I'm sayin'?
