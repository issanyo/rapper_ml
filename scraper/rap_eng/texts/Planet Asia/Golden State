[Verse 1:]
Don't mean a thing if it ain't got that
Follow the leader flow, midget jumping out my top hat
I'm going hood, going platinum in the projects
Diamond at the neighborhood, liquor store
Passport, poetry, dough, the passion and pope
Ask about acrobatical show, mechanical
Mathematical, I'm back telling it
Back on my element, that settles it
To peoples played out you never did
Classic ill niggas my claw
Fall back before the bread I was bred to be the boss
Talk right in exact
Freedom of death minus the word that wisdom reflect
This ain't the checks
These are the words that I manifest
It goes yes yes y'all
30,000 dollars of Remy bottles is staring at me
Nigga let's ball, god could never be a mystery, you feel me?
Cause in the heavens and the earth he always was, forever will be

[Hook]
I came to wake you up, the shit is fake as fuck
Fools is breaking up, cause they ain't caking up
All it takes is a little faith
Before you blow dough you better off investin some real estate
Stack it and just wait couple months you'll be great
Same as a nigga holdin weight
Ain't no joking when it's dough to make
I keep a soldier face
This is life in the golden state

[Verse 2:]
Only thing women respect is dollars
Even neglect scholars
Bunch of evil visions as baby mamas
Pimps patrol like piranhas, renegades wander
They end up choosing with honors
I'm just a don of all genres
Best known for throwing molotov bars and flesh eating acid at your armor
Fans get it twisted with my first shit but I was in training
I'm just a thug with esoteric verses
That'll clack out with you
Cop, cook, count, Bag it up
And distribute the product from the crackhouse with you
Splashing with more fashion than Fairfax
Raw dog like when I bareback tracks, tropical airmax
I'm not the one to share my snacks
These labels gotta pay me in racks, because the belt is black
And for the fact the fans never felt me slack
Honestly, it's nothing I lack
Now what's fucking with that, got hundreds of these up in the hat
It's like back to back phantoms and a couple lac's

[Hook]
