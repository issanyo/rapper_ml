[Planet Asia (Tri State)]
Peace True Self
(Peace Power Allah, what's good?)
Man I was on the way-way, man
These Babylons was behind me
I had the Allah Rule in the car, you already know what I had to do
(Peel his top off right?)
Yeah you already know, they out here try'na sacrifice the Gods
But you know I can't let it go down like that, fuck all that

Comin' up with all types of shit
I don't even write no more
I just let Dr. Dre write my shit

[Planet Asia]
It goes Fuck the Police, right off top
My Chain Military strike with accurate shots
Fuck marching and protesting
We're armed with them ARs and Smith and Wessons
Militant mind connection out the West in Kern County
I lick a shot at a crooked cop before I let him Mike Brown me
Jettin' through the turf on foot, I'm try'na push
Out of breath, if ever caught by these crackers, I'm cooked
So I plan strategic, cause it's a tactical war
Espionage way beyond the Spook That Sat by the Door
Babylon is fallin', never forget about New Orleans
Heed the calling, the battle was won before it started
My people El captured by the river of Egypt for sleep
Peep the political thesis, unh
To all my killers, righteous black guerillas
Death Angels, we shall no longer be the prisoners

[Hook]

[Tri State]
Overnight freedom fighter type
Black revolutionary caught up in the hype
Headed for the cemetery, hand over fist
Fist to the face, hand over chips
What's a brick to the safe
Pure Panther, pop at a pig' wig for answers
Mark of the militant streets cheered the anthem
Live from Missouri, caught a train from ?ville
Zimmerman pursued me, gonna hit him with two shells
Novus Ordo Seclorum, fill out a form
In the name of the dollar you raid, they were sworn
To Kill a Mockingbird, crowds flocking by the herds
The Devil fear the power of my words
This is Jesse Jackson, Minister Farrakhan
The Reverend Al Sharpton strapped with a firearm
Ready to ride like "Who ready to die?"
I keep a molotov lit and I'm aimin' at genocide
