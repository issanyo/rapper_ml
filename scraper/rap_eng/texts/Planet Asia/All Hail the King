"Behold your rightful King and heir; to the throne of the Kingdom"
"Long live the King"
"Long live the King" [chanting in unison]
"Long live the King in disparity"

Medallion's made man, the alien
Watch what you play me in
The vibrational tone is radiant
I was born in the desert where the sands is heated
As a liquid youth I ran wit the lions and cheetahs
A bunch of street corner hustlers, thugging for G's
Grew up on them food stamps and government cheese
Soul babies of the 70's, black and baptist
The 80's came, I found my blackness
Nine years old in 85, I caught Godly's spark
Cuz the God's were sharp, that's how I found my heart
Heads spinning on the sidewalk, we did it after dark
1989 I wrote my first dart
To the beat y'all, it was super scientific
Wanted to quit, until my Uncle told me I was gifted
So lucky me; now we're all here to sing to the throne of the Supreme
Kiss the ring, 'All Hail the King'

(Chorus) Planet Asia 2x
Medallion is the King is here
So you can put all your valuable things in here
Lucky me; now we're all here to sing to the throne of the Supreme
Kiss the ring, 'All Hail the King'

The valedictorian, my story is handwritten
You can see my transcript in Sanskrit
Purple mediation makes me move the quill
Cuz the dude is ill and his jewels is real
Practice makes perfect so I choose the bill
Cuz if I choose the chill then I can lose the skill
And if I listen to the radio I lose the thrill
So I make music that I like and choose to hear
So to know what I'm about you gotta use ya ears
And might lose ya peers, some might view it as where
But what they don't understand sometimes they fear
That's why the time is here for the mind to clear
So part ways from your plate if the swine is near
I got rhymes prepared to give the blind some care
So lucky me; now we're all here to sing to the throne of the Supreme
Kiss the ring, 'All Hail the King'

(Chorus) Planet Asia 2x

[Planet Asia]
Now I got you like "Yes Lord"
Yes everything before I snatch your most important piece upon the chessboard
Give that shit a rest, or...
I'll be leaving wit ya Queen cuz I seen that you came in wit ya best tour
Cold like the early morning winter
Pimp the pen like I rock Shirley Temples
Get it in wit a pen not a pencil
Permanent ink, cuz it's all in the mental
Let it come out dark and dreary
You start to feel me; the crowd can cheer to mark ya ending
Luckily that we're all here to sing to the throne of the Supreme
Kiss the ring, 'All Hail the King'

(Chorus) Planet Asia 2x
