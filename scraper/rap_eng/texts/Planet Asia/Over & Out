[Verse 1:  Nino Graye]

This is the ghost
So lets work up the pro
Known for spittin it cold
As my brain frigid and flows
Shown the skills and they're honed
Appeal and I'm still in it so
I'm hospital television, get it
Ill and it shows
Greater villain of poems spillin
Come home and lay chillin' a throne
Lay waste to the half steppers
I will if you won't
Brandish rhymes
Expands your mind 'til it implodes
Why do you torture the game?
For the thrill of it, yo
Go from giving 'em life raps to killin' it slow
High caliber spittin' rhymes 9 mil for a throw
Watch your steps when he givin'
You legitimate quotes
I had to walk on water ya'll are still in a boat
See the game is half empty but we fillin' it though
Tap the reservoirs
Understand we hit more than gold
Tell the people in the building to go
Give it a go, Nino Graye
Over and out
This is the flow forever

[Verse 2:  Bronze Nazareth]

Yeah, Bronze spill like mercury
Know I write surgery
Max pain axe main confess to the purple leaf
Heroin tracks hacks the raps with stiletto throws
Heavy metal elbows
Ralph palmetto rows
Worse than ocean barretta palms
Spit the ammo like a camel
The llama moans
I'm a hose a broad down
I'm don't go along
With a bag of plantain clips over long
So's roll along
Dope before clover songs
Moreover I pour something over this gong
Haunted by your memory skewered from now on
When I'm handed my jewels I'm screwin' my crown on
Long live Bronze Purple Gang townhome
Breakin'down bone
Chrome tomahawk blade
[Destro?] drinkin' petro high grade
A slave to the rhythm
Made him sharp enough to shave
Let's go

[Verse 3:  Flawless]

Yo I been a menace to society
Since Menace to Society
And I ain't feelin' you like none of medicine's inside of me
I'm militant so I'll never be hesitant to fire, G
Which is why I would think that you had better sense to fight with me
I'm a beast in this rappin' shit
With me beefin' is hazardous
My raps are deep as all these speeches about Jesus of Nazareth
I'll beat your ass completely for being decent and average
At rappin' and the only reasons to teach you a class in it
Wait ya'll let me get up in these wussies just a little bit
Because most of these idiots is pussies
And plus the internet is flooded with millions of would-bes
But it's really silly cause 90% just never could be
I ain't tryna be all funny
From lyin say your tummy
But there ain't no higher drive than a desire for the money
That's why I bring the heat hot as a dryer when it's running
And if you don't like it you could go and cry river for me
Motherfucker!

[Verse 4:  Planet Asia]

Yeah flow sober electrical
Exceptional Dope
Moped up from Mexico
1.5 on the track board
Alligator snap yours
National Geographic your rap chords
Tabernacle on the move
Smooth through the back
Dope beyond yours
Even though we launderin' this crack though
Encore the hardcore shit you applaud
Mostly I run up with the sewer like moors
Or with the guns up like I'm ready for war
My life ain't a script but this is the score
Ya'll best draw, raw to the last straw
Shift gears like fast cars
Served more bags than dashboards
Ice chest heavy on the neck
To the Gucci respects
Spit the buggin' this
But still I get the hoochie wet
Truth pannin' out to my respect less
Get in the contest fresh
And see who comes out the best
Planet A's Can is in your face
Camera's and K
Bandana state, animals apes
I puff grapes
Lest pimps fuck up tapes
Straight like that
You know what the fuck it is, Planet A

[Verse 5:  Canibus]

Once upon a time, very long ago
My ancestors came here to harvest gold
Canibus, see I knew Bis
Still don't understand what this got to do with the music
The whole time he was telegraphin' our civilization is ruined
Didn't even know what we were doing
Important provisions to pinpoint powerful pictures
To distract us how I feel for bitches
Cripplin' grief, with fucked up miserable teeth
These rhymes ain't even English [?] beat
Upside preserve
That's why I stand out like a black iceberg when I write my words
Street theater
Congressional pressure to confiscate the conventional weapons
Whatever it means, if you want freedom you agree with it
Nas gave you the power
I gave you 10,000 reasons, what's easier
Doing something virtually guaranteed to accomplish nothing
That's not the best I could come up with
Step into my pool of fuel
Green light on the kaleidoscope
Nobody knows what to do
You should have stayed in school
The nano aluminum particle reactor must remain sodium cool
Spontaneous plasma blow your ass up
When angels get confused they ask us
To limit your track and
Dizaster, you better be rappin'
I don't wanna hear none of that whack shit
Space time we talk at it
Forced synapses of mathematics
Motherfucker I ain't just braggin'
Thawed out the ice brought back to life
With legs blown off I still crawl back to fight
Fight for the throne and the ice age froze
My microphone light up the sky like Comet ISON
Landed with a planet of Asians
Let me qualify that statement
With the same medallion I came with
Melted it down, reconstructed it to a crown
Yeah nigga how you like me now?
