[Planet Asia]
Kalidascope
Planet Asia, in alien form I storm thesis, telekineses
Introduction to the function of the first verse fit
Something serious to bump like when you're takin a shit
Moonlight Melodic Rush lingo
Minglin wit murderers
Merchants and burgulars
While I just keep droppin singles, further
It started back before your TV was watched
From payin dues wit the pen, break out your cardboard box
I can out color for the page lyrics like taggin my piece
I marinates the moist voice wit the dominant speech
So get your shit straight, before you dictate some of this weight
Go break something, a broke rapper tryin to make something
Happen for the less unfortunate ones, for devils tossin us guns
Like cheese to rats to torture the young
Ten years to twenty-five-to-life you sacrifice for the gun
Even the righteous get hung, but still they slice wit the tongue
At nights I write to get from
My stressful, situations, successful limitations
Executed off the special talents
Off balance the art of challenge
School Yard an-alyst, part of thinkin conduct
As I construct the new attractions like what

[Hook] 3x
Analyze this, soak this, witness my anitdote got ya open
Kalidascopic

[Planet Asia]
Yo, done at the throat
Float, it's tidal wave wrote
Suicidal dope record recording Kalidascope
Touch bases, errupt the concept off the place of the earth
Pronounce the fluent antidote speech
While most promote static tracks
Sabat drops out the habitat, performing on DAT's
Average cats always surrend cuz I injure the stats
It's tender, the back bender, verse bowl of ? storm
Solo pitcher, graphic artist once my microphone's on
It's motions, Planet Asia make the miraculous gestures
Cuz when it comes to ceremonies, I just master my lectures
Photogenic, the summertime is where my nice dreams mix
We be at the corner store chewin on ice cream sticks
From Friday, to Saturday, to Chocolate Sunday/Sundae
Forever on the runway, radiating reports down the one-way
It's on, like Scorpio meets Capricorn
That I profess, talent that I suggest is fresh to perform
Born as a struggler, but not the average author and publisher
But a veteran of the society of composers and hustlers
Check it, my slang is touch language is angel dust
Compress to cassette, contain the rush, spontaneous
Adjust your lenses, and analyze the scenes that I wreck
Asia gettin down to business for the fiends to get swept

Chorus 3x

[Planet Asia]
It's plain and simple for y'all people can touch
Turn your volume to the far so your speakers can thump
Start, now all you party freaks will probably jet to the floor
Sweat till it pours, the Yard slang will set to explore
And I'm doin this for fam so it's must I come saucy
Hella-flossy on you know-it-all-ass cats that try to boss me
And my stats, and for that this be that big payback
Late night like Letterman, workin the wordplay like Pat Sajak
Now fish fillet that, it's fresh wish to obey that
I be the one to make you say "How could he say that?"
From way back, man I been doin this
And I'll be damned if I let y'all clowns ruin this

Chorus 4x

[Planet Asia]
Yeah, get ya camera, Kalidascope this
In your memory box, in your memory box
Yo to all the heads, to all the hip hop heads out there
Knowimsayin, get your Kalidascope
Put your vision on this, Planet Asia
