[Planet Asia]
Since the, first episode you didn't think that it would last
But this term it's Cali Agents for your sucka ass
Heirlooms to bust the ass, I transform from mental ?depray?
You got a beeper, but still you comin' up wit' lint
So I, starts my mission
Leaves my residence wit' secret evidence of the United States' past
President
We all a family, so therefore we must fight because
We from the same blood, the Most High comin' back to claim us
Subconciously, I crush my calm digi-tal-ly
Lyri-cal-ly wit' the shill of Israel over my physi-cal-ly
My ???? plot wit' seven virtues of mind
I lift off, like Mr. Spock cause the surface can get your shots
????? I missed the spot, I bless hip hop, connect my dots
Plus make you respect my block, I bust off, like, hot pistols
Yo, Ras, what happened to them cats that said we was trash
And said the road that we was taking to success wouldn't last?

[Rasco]
Yo, no where to be found, these clowns
They bitch made, I'm the switchblade
Talkin' that shit, you get split
We double headed, never forget it, the non-dreaded
Let's spread it on the ground, minus the head and crown
First round, ridiculous sound gettin' down
Comin' to ya spot, runnin' you outta the town
Profound tag team, shatterin' hopes and dreams
Be on your insides, ready to rip the seams
Straight from the stich, some brothers can act bitch
Broke ass niggas pretendin' to be rich
Can't rhyme a damn lick, but still be on the mic
They don't want the beef, but still we gotta strike
So put the track on, I'm rippin' the Bat ????
And call up your friends, I'll bring you the Bat Phone
Ain't no team better than As' and Rasco
We blood brothers here to enhance the cash flow, yo

Chorus(x2)
[Rasco + Asia] What they gon' do when we blaze they spot?
Lookin' around for different ways they can stop
No gimmicky shit, it's just straight hip hop
We Blood Brothaz, takin' care of one another

[Planet Asia]
Rasco and Planet Asia, ain't no breaking this bomb
We Blood Brothaz til the finish wit' the faith in our palms
So anything that comes between me and this cat gettin' dough
It's life or death, fuck around and have yo' back on the flo'
You know the convo', and every since we Took It Back Home
We kept the trademark, leavin' emcees bookin' back home
Cali Agents took the bullets like this, there is no other
And that's all I got to say for C-A, we Blood Brothaz

[Rasco]
Now wait a minute, let me put my ten cents in it
When you see Ras you better scream out lieutenant
Or captain, niggas be over reactin'
But we just ignore, go from shore to shore
When niggas test you, they got to test me, too
When God blessed you, he musta blessed me, too
We one in the same and ain't a damn thing changed
Stay outta the range before we bring y'all the pain
The ball and the chain that don't apply, that's why
You got stuck and got hung out to dry
Tried to be shy, but that shit don't fly
Sparkin' the jam like it's the Fourth of July
See, we got plans to travel throughout the land
Make plenty of grands while y'all sittin' in the stands
Cheerin' and shit, but I just ain't hearin' the shit
Talkin' the trash can get you ripped from the ass
You know that the Ras and Planet As' spit rays
We holdin' it down three-hundred sixty-five days
A million ways to get sprayed in the fade
I sharpen the blades, you on the blocks for the trade
Permanent shade under the dirt, last spurt
And what you gonna do when sellin' tapes don't work?
Get you a job, I know it seems real odd
We stickin' together like two peas in a pod, now

Chorus(x2)
