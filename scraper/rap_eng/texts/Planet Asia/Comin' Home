Tonight
So nice, so nice
Always so, so nice
Coming home to you

[Chorus: Celetia Martin]
'Cause it's been three years too long
Coming back to where I belong
You hold me down like no one before
Now finally, I'm coming home
This time it's for good
There ain't no place like my hood
Wouldn't change it if I could
Coming home, coming home to you

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Back to the same place
I used to be a hood nigga for real
True fi sell
You can catch me at the fish spot around 12 o'clock
Or at the barbershop
Probably in there smoking pot
Summertime, chickens out, and you know they're getting hot
Baby mamas getting head, baby daddys getting shot
Yeah, I know, that's a lot, that's I should be turning up
113 degrees, everybody burning up
Slip and slide, hood shit, waterholes, hefty bags
Icey house, candy house, now later's purple sacks
Summer league, goof games
Hoods start showing out
My city's the city you clowns need to know about
F.C., home of the three strikes
Most slept on, niggas hating on weak type
And we fight for the right to hustle
From the box to the streets
Ain't a town that can touch us
F.C

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
I've been all around the world
Japan to Amsterdam
At every convention
Rolling woods and swishes
Taking hella' bitches
Running in dudes' misses
From Germany to Britain
Flew with the jewels glistening
A few screws missing
Because my environment had me conditioned
'Til I started travelling
Now when I'm in the hood, all the old Gs listen
To the stories I be pitching
Because they knew me when my life was different
I'm a hip hop dude for real
Because I ain't ever have to use the steal
I choose to build, break bread and bleed the block
Get dough, and look for good weed to cop
Proceed with gwop
Hold up, breathe to stop
Yeah, soak it all in because it means a lot
When you're running around, spending money having fun
But even then
Fresno's number one

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
FC, Fresno City
Cats quick to let you have it, there's no pity
But on the right side, let me set the record straight
Yeah, I get dough, but my baby mamma's on Section 8
Which means I can get cream and stack
I'm like Goldie in the town
That's if you've seen the mack
There's no place like my hood
There's no place like home
There's no place like the block
I sold rocks in Rome
Until I D-I-E
I'm repping F.C
And I'm a do my thing, nigga
That's On Me
I'm going back to the streets where we used to meet
Share the same 40, man, and flip OZs
But this time, man, the zip's on me
Whatever you drink, whatever you sip's on me
It's the G-O-D and I don't care
*Where you from, fool?*
Fresno, yeah!

[Outro]
Master, master!
Master, there's some trouble. Someone's arguing at the restaurant, so I went down to see myself. It's really looking ugly. The guy's mean. He said his name was Slasher Pete!
