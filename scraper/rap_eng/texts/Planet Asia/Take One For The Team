Yeah la la la la, la lah
Dream, dream

[Chorus]
Every man must dream
So while I'm here I'm a take one for the team
They clear pulled about 16
Shots from the real niggas, don't pump no fear

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
I'm about the Renaissance
5 Gs a night
Peeps having champagne and the butler
Blackwoods and kush, trying to write something
Ill scenery is inspiring
City lights shining so bright
Imagination runs through my diary
My foes fell for the lack of acquaintance
My product is priceless
Art symbolising one behind the paintings
Front on the God, now what the fuck you thinking?
Shots from the rear, that's if you think you pumping fear
Fucking with street kids
Better be cool or you can see the fire from the pipe
Like a smoker in the night puffing C-Rools *crack*
I'm nice with the hands to clap traps
Go ahead and fuck around and see if I'm backpack
Get your ass clapped for gash racks
And that's that, stabbed in the clear
Because fear don't live here, it's been evicted
Just because I'm looking good and driving nice wheels
You got a gang of hating niggas trying to ice grill
So fuck how you feel

[Chorus]

Yeah
That's why I, I wear shit they don't sell
Cash cheques they don't mail
Balances, no limits, car black as hell
I got more acres than the pasture, man
Boy, I drive to my mamma house on my own land
Twerking hustles they don't comprehend yet
I flip a hundred thousand after tax, lean debt, clean cut
These ones so white for real
Cats probably lick my kicks
Thinking I'm standing in two bowls of milk
Getting more ass than toilets do
Because I'm the shit like your bowel move
And you a wild dude
My money old like good wine and cheese
I'm spending twenty Gs from 2003
Put me on any track and niggas say it's hot
I bet I spit crack like a loogie to base rock
I'm proud of the outcome
My first release and I've been have enough money
To not drop an album
I ain't steady, yo

[Chorus]

Everything specially business
Running all up in the city
Run and try to get that money
All the playing we did is over
Got me taking one for the team
Cross to stabalise and get that cream
Some of y'all know the hell I mean
16 shots and make out a lean

[Verse 3: Planet Asia]
First of all, ain't no touching the gang
Because y'all niggas can't fuck with the slang
Know what I'm saying
This is G.C.M. millitary
That M-16 ammunition, my nigga
Revolution is pump your fist
And we gonna run up in the White House and dump some clips
It's like this
I'm back on that medallion shit
So go rally your cliques
And tell them that we back at it again
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Skit]
