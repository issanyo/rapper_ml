It's uncut like real dro
We coming with that real flow
When we get together it's whatever you want
And when we put it down it's whatever you want
So cold cut y'all know
We coming with that real flow
When we get together it's whatever you want
And when we put it down it's whatever you want

Ayo, crazy in the head
My rock steady shots turn niggas to crazy legs
From crush groove to crush dice
I touch mikes plus I leave MCs hallucinating off my raps like dust
From solid land to shallow
From ocean to link the rap shall be felt
Once the god takes shape
Invisible Form
The earth is yes seen change
Or can straight kill all material so respect G
I thought I told y'all that Jason was a threat
I could have sworn niggas learned from The Faces of Death
Strapped cocked and rocking my raps
Silent weapons supply
Wars behold the barehoarse horseman
Holding the sword ghosting
I spoke
And the whole world felt it
And when I rhyme signed and unsigned mcs get dealt with
Off instinct
Black belt makes tracks melt purposely
When their motherfucking style is mysery
Verse with me, zone out
Yeah
From when his !!!!!!!!!!!! sense
To find my mind shift to a quality stage
So while y'all niggas flash diamonds
Me in the last !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Trying to outshine y'all
To the last assignment

Move in silence if you want more violence
Catch y'all with that iron
You start firing
Hot ones
My LP is pure coke for heads to nod to
I write tracks that attract coliseums
It's uncut like real dro
We coming with that real flow
When we get together it's whatever you want
And when we put it down it's whatever you want
So cold cut y'all know
We coming with that real flow
When we get together it's whatever you want
And when we put it down it's whatever you want

Ayo my music feels real good that's why the real feels it
Plus the rest of that shit should get filted
Who would've thought that a nigga from Cali would've brought the game back to the witted
They built it
My cypha sound surrounds the earth to leave the planet tilted
Quick to spill ill shit for real
And underwater niggas is bitin' like pits with gills
That's why I never show love to a snaked deception
I chop the motherfucking head off and take the blessing
The lesson digester
Throw the bitch like crack fouls
I crush your wack style cause you'll never get the best of
Mr. Mechanical
Guerilla congeal
General
Mageneral
I was raised !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fly criminals
It's Planet Asia
From F.C. the most craziest
With nine hundred and ninety nine names to the alias
You know who keeps steady
Ladies and Gents this is a major event

Move in silence if you want more violence
Catch y'all with that iron
You start firing
Hot ones
My LP is pure coke for heads to nod to
This is for my niggas to ride to
It's uncut like real dro
We coming with that real flow
When we get together it's whatever you want
And when we put it down it's whatever you want
So cold cut y'all know
We coming with that real flow
When we get together it's whatever you want
And when we put it down it's whatever you want
