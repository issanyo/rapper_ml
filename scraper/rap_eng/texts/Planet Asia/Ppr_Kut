[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
Face that awakes when I close my eyes
Face that watches every time I lie
Face that laughs everytime I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me right underneath my skin

[Hook: Chester]
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Verse 2: Rasco]
Hey yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind
I find myself in places with names but not faces
My memory races at speeds, hundred degrees
My soul, bleeds devil must have planted the seed
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust, they screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the flames

[Verse 3: Planet Asia]
All I'm trying to do is just master me
All I wanna do is smoke a blaster beat
But something keeps talking to me consciously
Responsibly, it keeps haunting me
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another person
There's nothing worse than trying to bring yourself up back from the dead
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head

[Hook: Chester (x2)]
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Bridge: Mike & Chester]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The the face inside is right beneath your skin
The the the face inside is right beneath your skin
The-face-inside-is-right-beneath-your-skin!
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down

It's like I'm paranoid! (echoes)

I feel the light betray me
The sun
(Can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin)

[Hook: Chester]
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
Like, a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath my skin
