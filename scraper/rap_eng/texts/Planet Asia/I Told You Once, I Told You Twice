[Intro: Guru]
That's right my man Prince Paul, Big Guru, Planet Asia, it's all good. But you know what, people be taking kindness for weakness right, I'm not trying to hear it
They be asking me shit, I'm not trying to hear it
They be trying to get put on, I'm not trying to hear it

[Verse 1: Guru]
Yo I told you once, now I'm telling you twice cat
You know and I know, I'm nice like that
Gracefully I age, like vintage wine
Because I'm true to the game, and I evolve through different times
Me and my man Paul, stimulate y'all
How come so many can bust shots, but got no hand skills at all
We didn't learn from the deaths of the great ones
And niggas don't think about doing bids, until they face one
I'm not a hater, I'm a congratulator
Plus I'm still in the mix, trying to get my paper
It's just that the money can't be more important than truth
And niggas have babies, but don't be thinking 'bout the youth
They be straight misleadin' niggas, while I be straight feedin' niggas
And if I had better marketing, I'd have better sales figures
Fuck it, steal my position I'll never share it
I'm that nigga from Gang Starr, and I'm not trying to hear it

[Hook: Planet Asia & Guru]
So do what we do it takes experience so aim high
We them guys in the game who take it serious
We come across humble, but we still might snap
And have a fit cause we not trying to hear that shit

I'm not trying to hear it, I'm not trying to hear that shit
I'm not trying to hear it, I'm not trying to hear that shit

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
With murderous flows, I stay on some MC next level degree shit
With a heart to beat, [?] annunciation
Yeah, no more shall I be fronted on
Songs get punished, published, performed while MC's get hunted on
And I don't give a fuck about who got a hundred songs
My stamina equipped with the banana clip, long
And y'all won't be able to last on that [?] shit, long
Cause to be able to spit, you got to plan your shit strong
I push to [?], that of a weightlifting inmate
Waiting on the track that somebody can send me
I'm from Cali where niggas try to be friendly, but quick to ride on they enemies
To honour the saga of war story trilogy's
My style cost more, you cats is sophomore
I'm everywhere oversees, or offshore now who can floss more?
Fuck it, I'll say it I'm sick of these white dudes
So fuck [landspeeds?], (?), and the new [Wu?]
Cause if I didn't do shows, I would've been murdered one of y'all punks
And probably made the front cover of [?]
And when you see me in the club with my niggas, we ain't rappin' at all
So the next cat to run up on some battle shit, I'm slappin' 'em down
Ready for repercussions, reefer puffin'
Streets is nothin', I'm slappin' niggas in the face just to teach 'em something
This is the new me, cause life is like a movie
Murderous few, from you know who it's yours truly
Planet Asia Y'all

[Interlude/Scratches]
Yo I told you once, now I'm telling you twice cat
You know and I know, I'm nice like that
You know and I know, I'm nice like that
You know and I know, I'm nice like that

[Verse 3: Guru]
Constantly I hear the same old joints, on the radio
It's crazy yo, I'm tired of them lame old joints
Some songs hot but a lot, purely political
Some rappers got energy, but need to be more lyrical
The game is changed though, it's about drugs and range rovers
If not it's about guns and expensive champagne, yo
They yap about whatever whip they've got
How many keys they flip, how many niggas they've shot
Have you forgot? The streets have always been that ill
Have you forgot? The god's got mad skills
And niggas need to focus before our cause turns hopeless
Or watch poverty and death, swarm our cities like locusts
Whether it's 1992, or 2002
I'mma rep like I'm supposed to for my peeps and for you
And it's true, my position I'm not tryin' to share it
Cause I'm OG Bobby Guru, and I'm not tryin' to hear......
