I think there's more to entertaining then that
And that's why right now i would like to talk about
What, i, bealive

[Verse 1 - Planet Asia]
Uncut,this be the realest feelin
Innovisions of victory got my squad big willin
The mic through Planet Asia
Submit to be, eventually 500 000 fans through mp3
It's all or nothin with myne's
I never waist time when it comes to puttin it down
I'm all in with my foot to the ground
So watch your inner sound
Outstanding,fuck you thought regardless
I'm standing out with or without Planet
Peer pushin page for page until
The coushin extends a book about my life
Written and recorded for your listening
I drop bombs over ww bleedy_eyes.com
But hold up me not done i'm uncontrollable
Step in my path and feel the impact quick
I train movin propels split to back sick

[Chorus]
My raps collapse the wackest like ??? accidents
Trasing my steps is part 1,2 and 3 the faces of death
Ey yo recognise the real fake emcees get done
Splashing the hapness on some hungry shit plus jus to have fun
You can catch me on the run but ain't no tracin my steps
Step on my toes or play me close and meet the faces of death

[Verse 2 - Planet Asia]
Yes,yes y'all one more time for dolo emcee
You know the name is still the same like polo
I'm uncontrollable like that
No need for running from what you can't see
So just get ready for the comin ill verses
I spit it at you for the fuck of it
Before you spill first my subconscience won't allow for the tip
Against your foul mouth
The overplace is totally placed
So doctor shine out
Fuck around and you's about to find out how it started
I snatched the mic from my counciller in the forth grade
I tore the whole motherfuckin house up
So courage ain't shit i stays competition crushin
These cats hella abstract and ain't sayin nothin
It's bleedy eyes red dotted in the facial
And if I don't know your name then that just means i misplaced you
A lotta motherfuckers say i smoke too much
But know what?a lotta motherfuckers joke too much
Who keeps the joint movin?it's Planet Asia ya'll
Straight from the Cali Agents off the mic if you don't know what you're doin
So give it here and don't say nothin
I stays huntin while other cats stays frontin you know
Now pop your collar to this leader to follow like it's tradition
As I manourve through the sound system

[Chorus]

Last but not least i send this out to my Audian squad who never shorted me
Thank you for supportin me
Forever always what would the jewels recordin me another hot one
My shit makes dj's hands horny for wax only
Ya'll niggas don't want me to talk shit
Snatch a fifth from out the closet on some blowin the dart shit
(that's why the ?? Greene)
Every outcome shall be jumpin till the very last drop
Until the blood stops pumpin (that's how we smash)
We roll until the wheels fall off, I got off verbal sort of
Live a lot the body sort of stinkin
Full of stinks for tryin to represent in the wrong place
Against some closed up like what the fuck you thinkin
(you gotta recognise)
Ain't another cat more fit for the position of a soldier only out to rip shit

[Chorus x2]

And you don't stop
And you don't quit
Planet Asia,Ricky Shay
What the fuck you thought
And you don't stop
Cali Agent school yard
And you don't stop
??? Cali in the place to be like...
