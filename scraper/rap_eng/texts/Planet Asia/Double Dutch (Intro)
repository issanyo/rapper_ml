[Planet Asia]
Double dutch intro
Sergio Tacchini on the pimp though
Flavor on a digital clip note
Spliff smoking rich folks
Sweaters in flats, where we at?
Titanium vaults, colorful thoughts
My words do somersaults
Thunderbolt crime rhyme quotes
You ain't old enough to be the goat
You know I be the most flamboyant last Mohican
If you ain't gonna mash for nothing, then mash for me then
Off top, you can feel the realness, red loops
I electrocute, holding my testicles across stage
B-boy shit, it ain't a skit
My error is golden, we bow down to the pharaoh
The chosen, architect, of the outer world
Its honorable whenever I spit
So there's no need to ask what time is it
I'm in time, on time, all the time
And what you call fucked up might just be the grind
Don't try to read my mind, read the signs
...
Shit is universal, with no rehearsal
Money all over the world, nigga
...
It feels good don't it?
Madlib, Planet Asia, California and we on it
