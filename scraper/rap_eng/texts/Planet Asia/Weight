Life...
Uh...
And it don't stop...yeah

[Verse 1:]
What's up world?
Dealin wit deep shit
Inside, I can't hide
It's what I sleep with
I took it upon myself to show my other side
I send this record to the youth
Victimized to abuse
Can't understand it more than those cats whose
-unwise decisions causes war
Internal, external
I broadcast this journal
-for all who walk around deceased
We breathe the air yet in the mind still we can't find peace
There's never peace, it's always war
Feelin sorry for what?!
Presidents and politics before the planet destructs
All mapped out
Sketched out
-written in Revelation
To the final destination
Heaven on earth is just a mental speculation
His death could be the message of the whole tropical
His life was so powerful
Nothing on earth is more valuable
-than what you become
So get your thinking out the box before you're restin in one
And be free
-no matter the case
Or on the contrary
My vision's a diary
No one but God can take it from me
So even if I'm on the 'undee'
-makin bad decisions
At least I' got a chance to make a transition
-from USA
Manipulators of the world we know today

It's all bad, but lemme tell you what you wanna know
Yo...ya'll need to wake up

[Hook:]
I got weight on ma shoulders that I gotta push
I feel the hatin it done affected a lot of us
It's all bad, and I' even been the one there before
But yo
Lemme tell you what you wanna know [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Ma grandmother always told me
"Jason, beware of your surroundings
...your friends you're counting on
-could also be your drowning."
She said, life is journey N we all on ships
So get your ownerships
-before you end up under the ocean of wasted talent
Where the could-have, should-have people sit and mope
My ambition reflects success; to my old folks
-just keep ya head up
It's got to get better
-because it's written
I know sometimes it seems the negativity won't let up
With the natural disasters and plagues
Prostitution and AIDS
Guns, grenades
-man made
These are the last days' norm
Starving children have no homes
While the entertainers watch
With all the millions being made, it should be owned
That's why I emcee only to open
Though this paganism
I blame it on the system
Coz it's more than racism
Watching movies like the matrix
-it's only plain and simple why we livin in
-a world of illusions where everybody praises dividends

But yo...(yo..yo..yo..)
Lemme tell you what you wanna know

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:]
I got ma mind focused
No more blind conversations
For real
Let's build
They' building missiles
-to kill nations
Smiley faces
Quiet maces
Settin up plans for so-called aliens flyin in space-ships
Like while the upper force is tampered
As been my ancestors
Separated through the filth
-so just to only be strong
Before we get there, it won't be long
Striving for better days
-placed to fuel for every hit song
As long as I strive
While I'm alive
I'll find my salvation
For conquering
All goals set to the side
To raise a consciousness
With one cause and that's
-to be right
Like, towards the east the sky is blue
-and God's the color of night
So it ain't no need for war
-coz it was once one land
-when it began
So recognize the planet's headin for destruction

But yo...
Lemme tell you what you wanna know

[Hook x5]
Yo...
Black people...
Knowledge, wisdom, understanding...
Man, woman N child...
Food, clothin N shelter...
And it don't stop...

Yo...Lemme tell you what you wanna know
