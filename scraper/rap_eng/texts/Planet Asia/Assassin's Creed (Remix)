[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Don't be mad at the sick writing
My boy is young clique trifling
Watch out, they here to lift your big bright land
Second outta my momma's four sons
The needle in the haystack to stick out like a sore thumb, hitchhiking
Your bitch my chicken tender
The world's my dinner plate and she on her menustration
I tell her I'm too fly for penetration
You're team playing I'm a K sprayer
Players make plays, the plays don't make players

[Verse 2: Token]
Woah, woah, woah, all respect due, you not due much
You don't do much, you got much to do, I do too much
You got it backwards, I never take back words
Throw words back 'til my back hurt, backed up, when your back turned, I'ma be back
Lookin' for the chip on your shoulder, homie I'ma eat that
Lot of people talkin' about me, I don't keep track
Same people sending me their songs I don't keep track
Click - delete that!
My feedback was, "Quit", so I quit givin' feedback
Kickin' my feet back thinkin' I just need to relax
Shit, where the speed at?
Follow me everybody, murderin' everything
They callin' me teddy but the industry idiots in my pockets to get the money, now bitch repeat that
I'm a young kid, slash old man, slash 'oh man he go HAM', oh shit, no shit, cast that
Fall back on the beat, got a beat to break then bake the beat to recreate
Don't respect you if you demand a trampoline every time you take a leap of faith
I take risks, take this, take that, take fans, take shit from no man
No man's land where I send y'all then forget y'all, I'm against y'all
Then again dog, this Token and he a full clip
Can't take me, tame me or entertain me with that bullshit

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Yates on a great song to lay shlong, on a beat a nigga way strong
Everybody tell me to pick up the pace Holmes
So I gotta rip it until all my taste gone
Spray zone, step into me get ya face blown
Stay home, N9na 'bout to race on a bass tone
That double a prone to lay clones up in the pital and they moan with a trach on
I'm the poppa, not the mama, dasvidaniya
When you come into my octagon, you lost mañana
And I'm 'bout to pop the llama, lotta commas, put a rock upon ya
Nobody want it with (K-O-D) and Token, he be on the (J-O-B)
He murderin' everybody but never the Illuminati
We makin' the wannabes (Say holy) (SHIT!)
N9na and Token be killin' 'em, all the fear that we instill in 'em
Make 'em shiver with the chill and them som' bitches
Thinkin' that Tech N9ne gonna mean that the gun glitches
Some crickets, what they hear in the place when I come wicked
I become vicious, Tecca N9na makin' dumb digits
And I run with it like when they hung niggas (Pyune)
I be the killa, the one you be feeling for real, I got the hot flows
Caught foes 'cause I got hoes, alot though when I rock shows
Not no iller scrot bro if you crooked you smell like Sasso
Used to be Rock, lock load, me and Token paint it like Picasso
Motherfucka

[Verse 4: Planet Asia]
The prime minister
Lines divine, sinister
Rhyme, greatest of all time
Bitch I laugh at your witchcraft
Pardons when it's started
I'm the seed of Harriet Tubman and Garvey
Run up on your '85 ass, pull an armed robbery
Act like you never saw me
Your main squeeze I civilized her
I'm the whack nigga minimizer
These ain't the same things as anybody
The hold shottys in the party
Talking 'bout you go hard, not even hardly

[Verse 5: Chino XL]
I spit and my inner demon is summoned
By this gene is lyrical Jesus vomit moment
My tongue is ill I win a ton on the church and revered like the redcoats are coming
I'm making artists nervous
The words that you worship
I make the juggeler stop working like he was fired by the circus
I'm so hungry I should rep Hungarian
How I press niggas, my religion should be Presbyterian
I'm a soldier surrounded by sick animals
I'm a veteran that is also a veterinarian
You better invest in the better hella medicine
Purchase like a lid of mescaline
My venom is alphabetical
This and that I am
Mounting your intestines with
Then resurrecting you back to life with a crucifix
You a coward that is out past your curfew
Being blessed by the limitless
Here to save you and your berfews
Sit your ass down in a church pew
Puerto Rican Chino, I turn violence into virtue
Whatever sin is in cinematography
You meant it like I'm a menace to pornography
I'm an oddity, need no psychology, it's helping
I'm on the same prescription and kill pricks while he's melting
It's ironic, I'm iconic
Not a comic, pro islamic
Stab a Nazi in the stomach
That was literal [?]
Ignorant family is watching over hip-hop still sitting on it
I'm the illest nigga to ever pick up a pen
And put together manners with the illest ambidextrous
Meaning many murders may come from me the one in my hands so physically as an artist and a human I am more advanced
Nice is what they call me
In any category, glory I'm baskin in
Your raps are thinner than hemophiliac's blood on old, dirty aspirin
I'm laughin' you askin' for death
Bring your thug best we can have a slug fest
Betcha you niggas all fail like Canelo with a drug test
FUCK OUTTA HERE!

[Verse 6: Passionate MC]
Yo, I'm putting the Darth in Anakin, ripping apart the planet with niggas alarmed and panicking
Thoughts are scrambling, more than the doctors handling all of your parts with bandages
And with all advantages I can show them through the devastation that
Their end’s awaiting like the head of Satan with a demonstration of its separation
Got the pencil breaking in the right hand, twist Necks like a mic stand
Nightmare! Rip flesh in the distance of a lightyear, yeah!
If you really want to talk about the buzz and the way that I had to bring it back quick
With a tactic that is steadily breaking the fabric of the universe suddenly at risk
'Cause I’ve mastered this, Passionate’s back in his actions of sacrilege
After subtracting these bitches way faster than an abacus
I’m blasting shit, the snub nose never tells lies
The .38 wrapped around my waist is not a belt size
Like pregnant birds in the sky, you’ll see the shells fly
Then I’ll kill myself just to make the devil in hell die
I tell time, and the clock is ticking on the opposition when I pop it in 'em
With an awkward rhythm, you can hear them hollering louder than opera women
I'm a beast!

[Verse 7: BRONZE NAZARETH]
Gold Fleece, no retreat
Talons slow creep
Blow leaf/ let his soul leak
Lettuce OG, throw three
Thru his lunch meat, I'm Shawn Carter plus Bunchy
Dalai Lama Diamond front teeth nigga
Cut the rhythm
Fuckin blades gut the chicken
Motown Im on the green like Chet Lemon
I'll put you in the sandlot/ stretch more innings
I took my bitch on a yacht, nigga that's offshore drilling!!
