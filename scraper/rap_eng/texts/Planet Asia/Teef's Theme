[Talib Kweli]
I smoke the light bud watchin' Fight Club 'til I'm charged
Like a suicide bomber off the words of Bin Laden
My block got dark and mysterious movements
I make the rebel music that the murderous move with
Thief's theme, divine style like the Steam Team
My rhyme style got me flossin' like my teeth clean
I drop the kind of gem that make your mama eyes water
This destiny like Nas' daughter
Unfortunately, you met the predator that's stalking that's me
I do it Travis Bickle style like "You talkin' to me?"
Walkin' with me you see the hand of God to force an MC
Put it down so hard respect is like a boss in the street
Workin' so hard that I talk in my sleep
Brain still goin' still flowin'
Watch the lyrics spill I fill with ill poems
You 'bout to do it big we do it way bigger
Razor blade spitter
In the hood let my nigga Jae get ya

[J Hood]
In the belly of the beast came a rebel named Joshua
That always had intentions of blowin' and being popular
Know when cops get buck, chumps get shook down
With extra large shells now there go your critical breakdown
Contemplatin' on chips and your ice
But I hear pops saying "You gotta do something positive with your life"
I ain't your typical thug
Leave you drippin' in blood
From a long clip and a slug
Hollow tips in your mug
Peddlin' drugs, I've been immune to the drama
Expressin' my persona
Always raisin' up the scama
I'm [?] with four strikes against me
I'm the best ya'll dudes suck you still gotta convince me
Peep your boy drop knowledge
I ain't never went to college
But I can teach how to get verbally demolished
My flow polished with greatness
My flow wear glow my hooptie got a lean
And my bars done mean
My and Talib will show you how to spit it
Anybody could get it
Spectators, broads and critics
Don't be a statistic
Of the murder rate
Run up on ya, dim all lights, park and clap at your vertibrae

[Planet Asia]
In the hood we them new gangsters
Garage scientist gang
Mind walkin' with a treacherous aim
My strain potent
Alchemy outspoken
Out in the open
Spittin' flame will have my mouth smokin'
Powerful parts of osmosis
Gasses, liquids, solids, ashes
Transmute and my life flashes across
Free from disguise of falseness
But still I floss
Never see me rockin' crosses
With black heaters we rack cheetahs
Wrap cheeba
Black leaders all gathered 'round the black Jesus
It's gospel when I write it down rain hail snow
Earthquakes puts the faith back in my apostles
Revolutionary gangstas techs squeeze murder beef
K-I-N-G medallions
Most wanted come close to (speak)
Cowboys clappin' who carry no holster
Don't approach us
Cause that's when ya ending starts
Heard the truth was power without a fight might bend ya heart
Cause when the truth hurts -- that's when the cleansing starts
Once knowledge is born I hit ten men with darts
When the end is marked, I just settle the plot
And when I score I'ma make sure I'm never forgot
To every block, hood, ghetto and park
I spit it sharp
For the villains still running from Narcs
