(So-so-so come along and I'll lead you the right way)

[Verse 1:]

I'm here to set it on ya
Direct from California
Central Valley agent, Planet Asia's on the corner
Letting it be known that when it comes to the squad
We mega-serious to be the most interested involved… in this rap shit

I place [ / plays ] my part just like a barber
I never sack a bitch; I represents just like a starter
Catch me macking down yo breezy
Just that easy with that nigga Carter
(sss)—At the hot spots, staring at all you haters
I rocks baggy like a skater
I never been a dater of a ugly duckling
Top notches I stay abducting off the earth
Into the hovercrafts, saucer
Or flying up in something
But later for that, cause then they all about sex
I'm into…
Making fat music, massive
All about checks… to cash!
My third eye x-ray through these plex-o-glass
Rappers that end up in my cypher
I might test that ass
Solid as I rock, static like blocks, get gatted, chopped
Massive slang practitioners be the next to drop
Massive slang practitioners be the next to drop
Skhool Yard slang practitioners be the next to drop
And if you don't know, now you know
We keeping shit hot [Exhales]

Peace to Shake
Peace to Likwit
Peace to Kubiq
Protest (Word up!), The Trendsetters: Obi-One, Dat, Epic, GL

(I think they got something they want to say to you…)

Yo…

Wolf Dog, Supreme, Kemet, Soul Father Rasco, Fanatic
Peanut Butter Wolf, let me bless it…
