(And a 6-pack of Pepsi Cola that always go good with the chitlins, baby)

[Phil Da Agony]
Shit...
But I ain't fucking with them chitlins
The most I'm a do is chicken, bad food'll have your breath kicking
Try a diet like Russell Simmons
Dating vegetarian vegan women drinking water with lemons
Low sodium salt, no pork on your fork
After meals you take a long walk
And stay away from the ballpark franks, you pulling all that rank
At Whole Foods putting fuel in your tank
That's more muscle for the machine
Brussel sprouts, broccoli and string beans
You get your choice of three greens plus a starch to go with it
Committed to the gym keeping your waistline trim
That put a grin all over my face, when you walk in the place
We had ketchup on Sunset, tomato paste
Chicago Summertime at the taste, no time to waste
We don't waste food on our plate, let the haters hate
Twelve-ounce steak, asparagus tips delicious, got me licking my lips
On some LL Cool J shit
No rib-tips, we take tips from the best chefs like Raekwon
Now pass the Grey Poupon, no MSG, no butter on my popcorn
This ain't a pop song, tell 'em

[Planet Asia]
These type of women I sees often, the Trader Joe
All natural juice drinking breezes be at the flea market
Berkeley Bowl, free range chicken and rosemary
Avocado California Rolls fresh jalopy
Yoga girl part agave
Green salad pita supporter, vegan au gratin
High on the calcium, cashews, callaloo and curry
Raw veggies, one hundred percent alkaline
Backrubs while I smoke my berries
You and your chick at Mickey D's ordering Frost McFlurrys
And one thing's for sure you got that (good thing)
That's why I got you pregnant cause your pussy was fertile
I can give it to you tough or take it slow like turtles
So soulful my tofu Whole Foods girl
Butternut squash, maple syrup, semi-succulent
You the one I'm fucking with
My organic supplement, always something healthy in the tupperware
I'm eating from the ground as long as we have an atmosphere
Day to day business, water, lime, maple syrup
Cayenne pepper fast, a ten-day cleansing
And if you eat swine that might fuck up our friendship
You know the God gotta have a Queen in the kitchen

[Krondon]
Missus microwave three day refrigerated meat loaf, tastes homemade
Daily grill diner, potato parmesan and no lactose
Doze in the massage chair reclining
Thousand Island ruffage, turkey stuffing with brown biscuits
Blonde Barbie dolls call 'em muffins
My honey loves mustard, chicken sub Quiznos munching
Veggie dog sauteed onions
Mouth full of Funyuns on the ferris wheel turning
Having so much fun, tummy burning
Hard, a masala make a hungry man follow ya
Right off the edge of the terrace, asparagus marriage
Bad vision fill my belly up with carrots, malnutrition
Cupcake cholesterol, lifting weights
In between the mocha milkshakes and the succulent Salisbury Steak, wait
She got a porcelain plate, cornish and crab cornbread, kosher
Feeling my foreskin, this Corsican's horse butt girlfriend
Gets full of forcing it in
In the end she skips din goes straight to dessert
And tries to feed me what's under that skirt
I leave screaming
