Believe the news, I'm gone for good
Call off the search, no one will know that I'm down here
Believe the note I left for you
You can't turn back the clocks, in a car underwater with time to kill

Make time slower, give me longer
It's too late for me, no one will know that I'm down here
And believe your dreams of me sinking
So far, below, you can't pull me up from here so don't try

Standing at attention
Dreams cascading around you like rushing water
Every pore is filled with hope

In a car underwater with time to kill

(Let me go)

Oh, Icarus tempting fate again
Altitude sickness setting in
Tradewinds bury fire from broken wings into arms below the ocean

(Leave it up to me)
(To burden you again)
(This ones not yourâ€¦)

Leave it up to me
To burden you again
This ones not your fault
So forget
So forget
So forget
So forget

[Planet Asia Rap]

(Leave it up to me)
(To burden you again)

Leave it up to me
To burden you again
This ones not your fault
So forget
So forget
So forget
So forget

Don't think back, don't think back of me at all
Just let me go
Don't think back, don't think back of me at all
Just let me go
Don't think back, don't think back of me at all (Let me go)
Don't think back, don't think back of me at all (Let me go)
Don't think back, don't think back of me at all (Let me go)

I'm in a car underwater with time to kill
Thinking back I forgot to tell you this
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me
What hurts more is I would still die for you

I'm in a car underwater with time to kill
Thinking back I forgot to tell you this
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me
What hurts more is I would still die for you
And I would still die for you
