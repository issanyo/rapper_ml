[Verse 1]
Yeah
Check the fly exotic thug shit

Street connected, lawfully elected
Knowledge the aura, my gangster is to be respected
Exclusive everything, allergic to the regular
Sky dweller, plane mode my cellular
Seven and a half ounces to bounce
And pop up with fly collectibles
With a pretty face lifted off the edibles
Wine bubbly, the grind's ugly
The time is money
From blind Samurais to blind gunmen
Spot a goonie like me, you got a good eye
Nine out ten I'm in line
Copping a nine dollar a smoothie
Respect the elegance, accept the medicine
Always kept it a buck
Fuck boys could never win
Boss players salute the lane that I'm in
Out in Adelaide they call me Planet Australia
All praises to the omnipotent
Try to emulate but you not as focused
The god has spoken

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Sway, historical blade is portable
Ya'll lucky I even made this affordable
The mural is magical
Haters bumping their gums like they're snaggle tooth
This is Michael Jackson, Michelangelo captures
Facing the fame on the throne
Three-sixty wave queens both side of my arms romancing of the stone
Got you dancing to my poems, the visuals ill
We in the future now, we born styles with digital quills
For reals
Diamonds uncut, crystals
The devils out to suck the natural resources up without paying the miners
I'm not a riddler, my following considered a cult
My catalog consist of more LP's than Sizzla
You know the king is rude
I puff a Chalice with the elder
Cool out and vibe while eating out your baby food
Shut your mouth what you chat 'bout
And fraud or squad front on the god
The fam' is pulling gats out
