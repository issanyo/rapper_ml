[Verse 1: Hex One]
Yeah
I scorcher any track I breathe on
Of course I brought you plenty raps to feast on
My forceful vocal cords have tortured many cats to fiend on
So peep without my heavy stash that he's gone
From each song, that's why I send these petty brats in ? caps to keep warm
So be warned, my entire click is sick as Richard Prior
Sitting in a liquid ring of fire, spliff, and gripping ?
Shifted pricks, get lifted high as blimps when ever clips expire
In my vicious crib which trigs in Memphis every brick is wired
Which is why I'm, like the provider to you minor students
I'm the igniter to the lighter fluid
I bring some lightning through to brighten dudes with
With this device I'm not the type to fool
I write the music right into the mics acoustics
My click is hype I light a stick of dynamite to prove it
We strike too tight for you to bite the movement
My pens blaze, in ten ways on records I'm praised
? ?  loaded combustible weapon that sprays

[Chorus: Hex One]
Son I'm fire, fire, yo
Spitting that propane, with the flames exploding you no names
Tell them niggas on fire, fire, yo
Bringing you foes pain, we incinerated from close range
Tell them niggas on fire, fire, yo
Spitting that propane, with the flames exploding you no names
Tell them niggas
My shit is fire son, my shit is fire, tell them niggas it's fire

[Verse 2: Tek-nition]
Disrespect and get your neck ? hate
Require fire drawn when I snatch a grave
And clown the firearm right beside your lawn, when the weapon spray
Then light it off, I'm like a wire bomb and a set grenade
To crash your turf, that smashes to the earth like I'm a seismic wave
I haven't started yet, my bars can spar with any armor vet
The architect connect the predecessor like it's Arbornet
Engulf a molotov and spark the nozzle off across your chest
And torture y'all with scorching molten jaws until I char your flesh
My pyrotechnic parables is like volcanic smokes
My thermobaric bombs are paragons to your dramatic post
Organic antidote, let's have a toast to Brandy's class and notes
To jolt the stash and clashing frantic votes and make the planet choke
It's the elimination, spitting flames inside the pits with Satan
In a dispensation that the judge will write the litigation
Over in the courts 'cause even hes a weakened imitation
'cause when I speak I breathe incineration

[Chorus: Hex One]

[Verse 3: Planet Asia]
React to gases and solids, emitting visible
Infrared and sometimes ultraviolet material
Chemical compositions, combustion, from oxygen within the written's
Once ignited I'm changing conditions
From the complex glow, black-body radiation
Soot, gas and fuel particles
The atoms get excited, photon a mission on a mission
Listen to this, it be the fire from the friction
The burning's occurring, check the temperature
Give me the mic I heat it up like a winter fur
My fire's never yellow, I never settle
For flame diffusion hot lava from the earth melting heavy metal
Bars is bonafide loaded with gospel
That even, predates the coals of ?? fossils
My freestyle forest fires could burn every ghetto and suburban area
And leave a positive process
It's toxic, environmental, hazardous, monstrous
Add oil and water, observe the conflict
Literally bomb shit, why spread contamination
More fire this is Babylon sanitation, chain nation

[Chorus: Hex One]
