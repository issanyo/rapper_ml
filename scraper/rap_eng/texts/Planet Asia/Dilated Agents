[Verse 1 - Rasco]
Look, this is the moment that you waited for
Dick Swan and [Asia] get in the booth start cocking the gauge
We with the D-to-the-I-lated
For all the cats that hated, the kid is back to bring you crack
Ounce for ounce, looking for the bills to count
Fuck the small shit, I’m looking for the real amounts
Swiss accounts, first name mispronounced
Kieda’s the name, yank dudes out of the game
Out the league, raw cats stop ya feed
Drop to knees, Make niggas cock to please
Thirty-to-life, I might have to blurry your sight
So worry tonight, the nigga with the dirtiest knife is Ras’
Dudes thought we was stuck in the past, something to blast
Do it right in front of your staff, still coming with the coldest shit
We unload the clip, so peep game I got blows to spit
Yeah

[Verse 2 - Evidence]
Aiyo, it’s my turn
Dilated Agents, Evidence, Cali’s long awaited
Keep shades drawn until the sun’s faded
Night-time shit, forty-city tour equipped
Two bus entourage, long trips with full clips
Keep a daily dosage of the medicine: Never O-D, O-G!
Do it like Geo, when I’m toasted, post me up
Close up cats is out of focus
Dilated Peoples done undid your vocals, man
Stop fronting like where you from is a hot spot
Only chalk seen on the sidewalks, from hopscotch
Manley vox-box got top notch compression
Lock and load, rock and roll, stop the session

[Verse 3 - Rakaa]
This is the moment that you waited for, Weatherman and Rak’
Get in the booth, and start cocking the Glocks
With Rasco and Planet [Asia], we manhandle the stage
My clique’s in back to click the klack
For self-defense, for revenge and retaliation
I roll with Blacks, Browns, crazy Whites, rowdy Asians
Vacation, Pakalolo, Maui-Wowie blazing
The deadly Dilated, with the killer Cali Agents
Central Valley to the Bay, true to that L.A. shit
Rakaa’s still repping Rock Steady, Zulu Nation
Viva ancients, rhythm and mathematics
Today this edutainment is beautiful black magic
We like to bomb this medicine up, like Thomas Edison
But it could be dangerous, best handled by veterans
We not ones to kick down doors, so let us in
Record labels feeding us pork, filling our head with sin

[Verse 4 - Planet Asia]
Yo, it’s the next edition, Dilated Agents defensive
The forefront of the coast, the great wonders of my existence
Stand firm like, pagan holidays and Black’s eating chitlins
The master plan of a military invention
This is medicine with no subscription, positive pulp fiction
Depictions of a desperado lets the ghost whisper
With a host of victims, toast to the most official
Unloading missiles on your soldiers, holding loaded pistols
Cold a hit of the medicine, revival time when I rhyme
Suspect niggas already know the mission
Acknowledge the god, observe, learn and listen
Got you spinning off my shine, like the Earth in the Sun’s distance
Dilated Agents, we the greatest, ‘Cali-hop’
All-stars, true to the game, but still about our paper
Choose your weapon, grab your favorite sword
The time is now this is the moment that you waited for

[Outro]
“Whoever’s out there to rep... Planet Asia...Rasco
Whoever’s out there to rep...Rakaa Iriscience, Evidence, Babu
Whoever’s out there to rep....Planet Asia...Rasco
Whoever’s out there to rep....Evidence, Rakaa and my man Babu
Dilated Agents"
