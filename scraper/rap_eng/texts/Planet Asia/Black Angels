[Killah Priest]
Yo, I react like an American parasites
Feed off the jealous type
The world is crazy, shoot at the satellites
We hijacking rocket ship
Hawaiian panel push your channels
Lift off from a docking cliff
The governments been in bad shape
Out in black space
It's 'Planet of the Apes' landed on our states
The cannon's off the waist, mag 'em to ya face
Dragon of the state, handgun of the state
Phantom from the jakes, running rampant in the palce
Get those cameras out my way
Guided by Black Angels in plain clothes
Dwell where the Saints go
Stained windows on Temples
Devils tremble from the rebels mental
Desert Eagles Cathedrals, we live illegal till the Beast move
Then we shoot his people, forth dimension where we unlead you

(Chorus I) Cynic
We created in the image of the G O D
That's why we take lives and create them so freely
Now we living the thought
We Black Angels in camoflauged outfits wit black halos

(Hook) Scratch
"...Black Angels... dark feathers out the raincoat
Sinister Serpent... ready to hang folks
...Till ya neck choke... eyes poke...
...Then we vanish like smoke"

[Planet Asia]
Anunaki, honor my posse, Panther paparazzi pamphlets
Copy copper, little choppy when I spread the cancer
I start fishing for thoughts from dark ether to light
Part teacher, part creature at night
Catch me coming out the tabernacles wit goons
Revealing in building, or how the devil got us acting like coons
Like the universe tangle as we celebrate
The making of man made in the image of the malonated Angels
The eye of the third is dangerous
Great man get ordained from walking thru the King's chambers
His royal highness's the mighty lip
This life can be a gift when you dealing wit science's
Let's crack the safe for the sake of the savagery
Then escape in metallic objects thru the galaxy
I'm living lavishly, burning these calories
Bow to the Majesty or bow out gradually
The Black Angels

(Chorus I) Cynic

(Hook) Scratch 2x

(Sample)
"Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy Name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those that trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen"

(Matthew 6:9-13)
