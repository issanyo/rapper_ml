[Verse One: Rasco]
Ayo fresh out the cut, we armed with bombs
Cali A the tag team, still for the cream
Planet A to the soul, man you niggas know the rest
The best at putting minds to the press
Hit y'all with 20 or more
What these other cats spitting it for?
Better quit, I still spit ridiculous shit
Over beats I be running over tracks
I double back and smack through the cracks of the wax
My hands is looking for grands
Nothing but concrete plans in the mind
This combo is one of kind
Once in your lifetime will you ever see (What?)
A better breed of MC
Stepping to us can cause a whole lot of fuss
We ready to bust y'all, I couldn't trust y'all
Me and my man be at the joint on point all day
Entering the extra dark hallway
Find me chilling at the crib with the kid
Y'all be running on that 0 and 10 skid
Peace to Wildchild and my nigga Madlib
Rasco the nigga with the illest adlibs

[Hook] {x2}
Now who think the style is fresh?
Man you running with the best
Express and bless straight from the west
Hit y'all with double the dose
Man you couldn't come close
We plan to run the whole damn coast

[Verse Two: Planet Asia]
It's like magic how we make shit crack
Cali Agents on some hungry shit
Boom bap and battling raps
You can't forget the scratch
With forty deuce throat cutting like slash
We  in the lab but we ain't wrote nothing
And we on something
All you can say is we all rhymes
But the fact is these cats only think small time
Ayo building on these tracks like blocks
Full of stock, ghetto warfare, prepare for ammunition pon cok
Once rhymes ricochet across the globe
In an example precise
Negotiating life lines in the verse
Let off some shit
I'm quick on the draw
To bust like dick in ya jaw
Anything to make my competition fall for the trap
Cali Agents all over the map
You know the steez, most of my shirts match my fisherman hats
One, two yo
This is just preparation
For my bredren get him locked down in the stations
I shall blaze one
Light one, save none
No fronting, end the circumference of who the Agents
Strike first
Windpipes or mic thirst, my verse can your star burst the Earth
We getting down under the surf'
Thought we were phony?
We don't just conceal it we reveal it
So we slapping you in your face just to make sure y'all people feel it
Thought we were phony?
We don't just conceal it we reveal it
So we slapping you in your face just to make sure y'all people feel it

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Rasco]
Ayo Ras' be the man yo
Coming with a lot of ammo to shoot
Rhyme for the loot
Pull y'all from under the roof
You a full time substitute
I teach then try to reach
The masses and if I not I rip out they asses
For trying to skip the Cali Agents rap classics
Classic
Lay it all down to plastic
Remember the days of getting fucked up and blasted
But no more cause this cats got a whole lot to live for
Still banging on the door
Off of the hinge, better go tell your friends
You looking at Ras' he's on the wide screen lens
Top ten at any damn time we can rhyme
We bringing the rain and niggas singing sunshine
My time is now gotta strike to the mic
But ten years strong and still down for the fight

[Hook]
