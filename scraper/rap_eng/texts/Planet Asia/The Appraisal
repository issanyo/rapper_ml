You know what I'm saying, this is the start right here, man, you know what I mean, the beginning
Chains hang down to the dick!
You know what I'm saying, hard beats and rhymes and shit, man
Medallions
All that soft shit is over with, man. All that cornball shit. Shucking and jiving shit
Get ready for GCM, it's a movement
That corn shit is over with, man
Word at y'all niggas
Yeah, PA!

24 carat ice knuckle medallions
This is thick rope, representative rap, custom cut
For a figurine flossing
African black gold
Flooded out Isis, Heiru the Trinity
Asiatic jewelry, diamond studded spaceship
Cometic prince, [???] hieroglyphic on my bracelet
Bad biter style, honour the golden child
It's about to be the richest in the game
Got me, dealing with alchemy
Rose gold, 43 inch, swinging my dangler
This is Jewelry Box Sessions: The Album, another chamber
At your local mom and pops' for you to cop
My shit'll make you do the wop
Can even make an 85er do the knowledge
Mics, I blow them up and sew them up
For y'all niggas who know what's up
Dumb fuck, I said 'woods, not a dutch!
I'm sending niggas to the corner store for blunts, blues, whatever
Niggas better bring me what I want
Hands is torpedos
Jaws I tap
The jaws that jack
Niggas is wack, rap and try and glorify crack
Leave it to the ones who did that
I slid back, made maneuvers for money
Merging as I'm emerging with medals
I'm the ill cat fans know they gotta' purchase
I put the most work in, nights in the purple
I write for the virtue, strike to merk you
Halal fool, this is Jewelry Box Sessions, nigga
The Album
