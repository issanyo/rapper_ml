[Verse 1: White Rhino]
Like Leonardo I'm lyrically leaving lacerations
I'll slash your face and keep on swinging for decapitation
Last thing you saw was a machete and the mask of Jason
And the sound of me laughing out as you slam the pavement
If I catch you sipping lean and wearing skinny jeans
I'll rip out your spleen and throw you in a fucking guillotine
I'm hip-hop until I drop and I'm dead
All I need is word from Chop and it's (off with they head)
You poppin’ off at the mouth you ain’t poppin’ the lead
Only time you being honest when you talking to feds
You lost all your cred, and I'm a knight riding in shining armour
I've been grinding harder, getting higher than a flying saucer
Sonin' you Sky Walkers Luke, I'm your father
The white Vader, with a light saber, feel the wicked force
I slice haters like rice paper with liquid swords
(I slice haters like rice paper with liquid swords)

[Chorus]
Calling our bluff? We chopping you up
You don’t want to get stuck, with the top of a buck
Ready for war, when we enter your door
Sever with swords, leave your head on the floor

Calling our bluff? We chopping you up
You don’t want to get stuck, with the top of a buck
Ready for war, when we enter your door
Sever with swords, leave your head on the floor

[Verse 2: Tone Chop]
When I swing my sword I'm cutting through you, yo
Leave your head on the floor of the studio
Limbs on the track board I'm that raw
Knife in your back you try to head for the back door
I'm back it's a wrap for you trash dudes
Choke you with your own chain trying to flash jewels
I'm past cool, sucker I'm stone cold
And when pressure is applied I won't fold
It's a gamble like Frost trying to roll the dice
Chop your hands off how you gon' hold a mic
I'm reppin’ for the Bing and I hold it down
Tone Chop I'm the king with the golden crown
Sick of ya'll rappers all broke and lame
Box cutter have your blood squirting out a broken vein
I'm sharper than bear claws and broken glass
Bunch of dick suckers hope ya'll choke and gag

[Chorus]
Calling our bluff? We chopping you up
You don’t want to get stuck, with the top of a buck
Ready for war, when we enter your door
Sever with swords, leave your head on the floor

Calling our bluff? We chopping you up
You don’t want to get stuck, with the top of a buck
Ready for war, when we enter your door
Sever with swords, leave your head on the floor

[Verse 3: Planet Asia]
Vicious blades, ferocious ever clever, watch the wave
Beat you with the tip of my knife, better behave
Take him to the basement, my mind cold, no need for a blindfold
I want you to see this, we should tape this
Gory on my story, glory when it’s gory, they reward me
I’m on the run, eating like its N.O.R.E
My slang spirals, my gang viral, I’m liable
To leave you with a hundred holes in your frame, it’s tribal
American ninja, several contenders
I left them in garbage disposals, down the toilet, and in the blender
I’m sick, you can’t control me
Your timeline I’ll have that shit flooded
Bunch of crying emojis, leave me lonely
That’s a warning, word of advice, front if you want
Catch a 50 and a buck, you don’t want to get stuck
I swing an axe like a baseball bat, don’t make me trace ya’ll tracks
Death and destruction, our meeting will be based on that

[Chorus]
Calling our bluff? We chopping you up
You don’t want to get stuck, with the top of a buck
Ready for war, when we enter your door
Sever with swords, leave your head on the floor

Calling our bluff? We chopping you up
You don’t want to get stuck, with the top of a buck
Ready for war, when we enter your door
Sever with swords, leave your head on the floor
