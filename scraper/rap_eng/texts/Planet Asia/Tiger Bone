[Intro]
Yeah
Rest in peace to my brother Jacka
We miss you my dude
Its for you

[Verse 1]
Uh
I put in work like I'm clocking in
Planet Asia, gold chain, ain't no stopping him
All the haters be watching him
Competition be subliminally
Popping shots at him
Bottles of (?) and I'm not a battle rapper
Monk general with tablets out the Tabernacle
These rappers got me bored like a Ouji
What I write is graffiti, flights to Fiji
Hop off the plane, jump on a scooter
Top floor suites for all my shooters
Kiss the ring, its the king, lion of Judah
Ya'll dudes only kings on the computers
Know some niggas got cream off selling buddah
Know some niggas used to be square that turned tutors
Snort coke and smoke (?)
In Cali its called Cavy, don't matter just don't do it

[Hook]
I'm one of them black niggas that got money
You one of them rap niggas that act funny
He wanna have everything I got don't he
I probably lose everything that I got one day

I'm one of them black niggas that got money
You one of them rap niggas that act funny
He wanna have everything I got don't he
I probably lose everything that I got one day

[Verse 2]
Back in the days we was break dancing
Now we taking 25 to life chances
Lord knows I miss my brother Jacka
The heart of the bay could never be another actor
Rest in peace Mac Dre, free the Mac Minister
These little niggas nowadays much more sinister
Promethizine zombies
Zanny juice leaking out the titties of they mommies
Only 12 but still will bust shots off in your Abercrombie
Hoes who play with their nose always asking who wanna party
And it shows from when them hoes start losing their body
Niggas on the corner talking at the sky
Crazy as fuck, he used to be the guy
A whole line of thugs that fell off from designer drugs
Few niggas bounced back while others tried to find a plug
Sometimes I can't lie, it feels like I'm alone
Like an OG exercising sipping Tiger Balm

[Hook]
I'm one of them black niggas that got money
You one of them rap niggas that act funny
He wanna have everything I got don't he
I probably lose everything that I got one day

I'm one of them black niggas that got money
You one of them rap niggas that act funny
He wanna have everything I got don't he
I probably lose everything that I got one day

[Outro]
Uh huh
Yeah
All my peoples man
My whole family
You know what I mean
