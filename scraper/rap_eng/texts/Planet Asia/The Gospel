[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Universal math blowin this purpose for the turf
Burst the AR, protect ya seeds and earth
M16 my motto follow the leader or proceed
For penalty from powerful kings I'm back spittin
Happily shittin on crews my fuse lit, cause y'all cats is comedy
Kathy Griffin the mic emperor Knights Templar controllin my temper
Waiting on my shrimp tempura
Rap pharaoh solid beam sword nah mean lord?
Under like we're paramagnetic to the Ouija board
Sorcery skrilla power Allah Hassam
Medallions I rally around fortune and killers and dealers
Still Cali bound torchin you niggas
Front on my shit my niggas might alter your image
It's like that nigga dart throw the art show thought so
You fuckin cartoons get your face blown off partial

[Verse 2: Nightclubber Lang]
I'm the envisionist precision with the penmanship
Salt for the listeners to judge me off the sentences
Words plus the verbs and the adverbs to walk with
Burn any nerd with some traction to hock spit
Launch a loogey the headbanger boogie
That concrete spit be the opposite of booshie
When life's like a movie that symbolizes lefts and the rights
And surprises Karim got the hijinx
Jokes and the caps I'll provoke any scrap
I'm the wild thing the Tone Loc vs. most local rap
Or the Funky Cold Medina or the theme when you walk into the ring John Cena
Or the Barry Bonds see ya
I'm the Thing, Kurt Russel with a little bit of muscle
Who scenesters be knowin be the man with the hustle
Fuckin Nightclubber Lang with a bang plus a bang
Stands for change watch us rearrange the motherfuckin game
