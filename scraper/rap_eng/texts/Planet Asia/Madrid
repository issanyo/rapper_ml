Nobody move, nobody gets hurt...

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
My art imitates life, the whole ship
But what's a goldfish to a great white
The moment where I get mad at is when I take flight
Snake bite venomous strikes
Or I only surround myself with those with great minds
When I scarf sharks, no phones
Never been caught, click
Adalay sway, Travel Fox, where the diamonds at
I heard you caught a jux, so I guess I get 'em half price
Let it be off of the books, I hit the Thai spot for fried rice
Sipping on a Pilsner
Vision me on my seas chilling with my fly wife
The villain got his mind right
Dynamite mics, right out the limelight
F.C. show you what that crime like
This was documented on knowledge, god
Fresh out the barbershop straight razor
Line-up, now Jerry a german cut, spinning waves
Catch me at the section where Hex murder
Ask and axe the rhythm out the cage
I gift-wrap grenades, issue out missiles
Rocket launchers aiming at your planes
I'm banging for the chain, '67 old school shit
Might see the god swinging in this thing

[Verse 2]
Did it big in Madrid
Veggie pizza and beers
Cigarette spliffs behind the ears
Gave my best years the best here
Still on top, check cashing
Corny niggas still doing pop shit
Top floor of the Ritz
I brought my own pot-stickers
Swift optics could catch a mosquito with chopsticks
Knock this, vintage hip hop, straight off the bloc
I'll admit some niggas got good music
But they ain't got this
I let the Trey Eight pop quick
Instead of your clock going tick tock, it'll go tock tick
This goblin's like you, I don't rock with
Run around like you wasn't taught
You see the logo and you know that it's prosperous
You don't even deserve an esophagus
What you know 'bout mobster shit? G
Mysteriously, my aura in the hood is giant
Like I came down from serious b
Till the dough gone, with Madlib, astro-traveling
Murder medallions you pay me for the cameos
Cause I'm the motherfucking antidote
And that's that...
