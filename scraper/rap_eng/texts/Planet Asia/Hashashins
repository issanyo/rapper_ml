The T.V screen portrays scenes
Imitated by these kids in the streets
With they irons
Branded in they hands yea its tools for the dying
Flying, gliding
Bitch I'm never blinded
Herbal remedy keep me up I'm grinding
Watch out for that boy yup yup
I'm shining
No Nicholson more genuine
Like pendulums or emblems
When the suns reflecting off them yup
This is venom for your mind
My equilibriums tremendous
Do this all the time
Use the pencil as a weapon
Large percentage use their minds
To pay attention to the dumb but wonder why they are confined
Life gives you signs so my sights three eyed
Spirit always peace microphone eating no receipt
Obese, like fat fucks riding in ya jeep
Smoke one rap vibe fly as window seats
Me, electric shock therapy Jeremy
See you all in the new reality

Found a pen so I started spittin fire
This my work let me act like I'm hired
Smoking fire higher than a fiend from the Wire
Burning base like my name was Richard Pryor
I mean I'm running base young Mark McGuire
Grip on the games like a pair of fuckin pliers
So skate you thought I played for the Flyers
I'm so great kiss the hand Class the Sire
I inspire just retire
Little effort is required
I acquired everything my heart desires
Any beat gets destroyed never tired
Beastie boy I been a beast
Beats get burnt like forest fires
You can see I destroy with no need for a decoy
The real McCoy get eatin like bok choy
Rockstar Shopboy beach I deploy
Find weather to enjoy

High like fives, dives, astronauts and French fries
I see you want a slice but didn't help bake the pie
King in my eyes never mind ya sight
Would say I'm fly but any eye can see my height
Rolling on my j nice weather next flight
See you all on tour just me and one mic
