[Intro: Phillie]
Uh-huh, yeah, that's how it all goes down, yo
Youknowhatimsayin, in the blink of an eye
It could be you.. youknowhatimean?
Hmm, just count your blessings and be glad that you here

[Hook: Prodigal Sunn]
We them goblins (young kings, jewels, acres and gwop)
We keep rising (and like the sun, yo we stay on the top)

[Phillie]
The story is touching like Shakespeare wrote it
Potent enough to propel a helicopter off and coast it
It opens with a hood setting, hood life, hood dreams
CREAM is the motto, let's follow throughout these city streets
Had an influence on most, the kind, have blind leading the blind
Refine light years ahead of his time
Pedal drugs above the street level's thugs and hustlers
Fiends issuing checks, hoes issuing sex
Probably too much to muster, plunder til nothing's left
No honor amongst thieves, believe the sudden death
Never enter this brain, doing his thing, pushing 'caine and all
Where they hate it if you getting paid
And they not, now they plot to discontinue his reign
A king to a slave in just a matter of days
A million ways to die, was his decision on the clock
Most niggas I know'll simply die for they block
What a way to go, no justice expect this guilt I'm stuck with it
Laid it for all you haters, my guns is rapid firing
The streets silence them, I could of saw us all retiring
Believe in karma, cuz I saw the drama climbing
Kept an eye on 'em, turn 'em ex-men if they all trying 'em
This ain't the burbs, no police sirens, just violence
And tragic endings, casualties pending and souls risen
I burn immune to the street living, I'm no victim

[Chorus: Salute]
These streets ain't paved gold, walk with a limp
Pair of dice and kangols
From pleading to robbing, from green, we goblins
Same greeds and rhyming, you feel me?
Life is like 'deal me in to do me in'
Same grave I live in, still the same grave they threw me in

[Planet Asia]
Straight out the first degree, like one in air, I came to murk the beast
Street technique, Wu University
Perfectly poisoned and perpretators purposely
God Body, I'm backing my book of life, for certain, b
Slang radiant, stadium effect, ice fang mangle and respect
Knuckle up, you hang 'em with vests
It's nothing brah, King Tut muscle hustle us, duck
Crusher the slum, dum-dum, hand gun busting at cha
Niggas is wack and old, pass the toll, pass the bowl
So I can see some shit from another level to match my soul
P. Sunn, pass me the match so I can clack and load
And cut these muthafuckas wig off just like an afro

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, the scene was poetic like Hitchcock's words
Chilling enough to freeze the blood on Illinois curb
Just started with a tenement setting, the plot would thicken
The root of all evil, only grows from his wishes
Started catching victim, victim by the ATM on Whitmin
His pops was a one hit wonder hitman
Underneath the river they shipped him, and found an armed suit forever to fit
Him
He was a leader, but eager men follow patterns like receivers
Trash blowing through allies
See the deacons standing up in front of theatres
His own following, plotting to swallow out the pocket column
Rottweiler to chihauhua in just a few hours
Premeditating his last possible oxygen swallow
Gasoline, moccasin, kerosene, towel
Twenty two slug, broke his mug into particles
Told his brother be strong, and calm a storm a little
Exit early, stage left, the clue, the life's riddle...

[Chorus]

[Hook: Prodigal Sunn]
We them goblins (young kings, jewels, acres and gwop)
We keep rising (and like the sun, yo we stay on the top)
My brothers rhyming (all the guns in the hands of the cops)
They keep on climbing (the G-O-D-Zs, we can't be stopped)
