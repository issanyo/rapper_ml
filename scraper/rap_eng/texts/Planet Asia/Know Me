[Intro: Planet Asia]
Cats think they know me. I ain't even gave y'all a quarter of who I am
Wuddup. That's what i'm talking about
I been trying to let you make it right, I been tryin to tell you
You wasn't listenin man. Listen man. Don't talk so much

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Yo my life consists of love hate
Some time is straight faced
But i never let it go to waste
I write from the heart while others trace
Make no mistake what i jot down be leaving your mug squenched
Like you just been sprayed with mace
Thugless drugs story my saga got killers changing up fates
Snitching is a disgrace mob legacy what it was is what it ain't
And you can feel the pain when i paint this
The skies turn grey in the summertime
Strays get shot lives get taken
The dumb deaf and blind need to awaken
Cause the poor getting more poor the rich keep caking
The earth is possessed the worst is the best
The best is considered the worst but here's a classic verse
I had to get it mastered first this ain't entertainment
I'm trying to get acquainted

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
Hold the weight golden state
My cultures fornicate
I hit the Remy just to get me outta sober state
Lone clips get a load of this
Street soldier rhyme soloist
Mos Ayatollah with a shoulder chip
Kush in the zip, hole in the wall flips
Bootleg outfits and counterfeit $100s
I'm bout it when I want it
No doubt medallion season is in
Last year y'all fake dudes fronted
I'm back with a vengeance
Didn't wanna beat you over the head
Next time I'm coming with my ninjas
Straight from the trenches
Barbaric weaponry
My skin thick its the opposite of leprosy
Believe it or not you ain't heard the best of me
I'm in the kitchen with the 1st prize recipe
Get a test of the best of
I'm on the turf with it again now West up, wuddup?
