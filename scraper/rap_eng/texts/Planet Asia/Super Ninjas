[First Verse:  Cappadonna]

Yeah things wanna hop out cabs and shit, yo check it out...
Yeah I was chillin' in my cab
Picked up these four niggas
I could tell by the look on they face that they was trickin'
So I took them to they rest stop
They pulled out the thicket
Said they was going to kill me
Then they took the weapon
So I bust off my clothes, I started to skip
I got to my man blue house I feel like shit
[?] We plan no attack
And two weeks later we got the wind back
Dumb niggas out here wanna rob and steal
And hit them banks motherfucker that's keepin it real
And ain't nobody gonna squeal
Cut that bread out
Everybody get a mil
'Sno turning back now
Hope nobody don't lose it
This is just what the fuck you gotta do for the music
Hip hop!

[Second Verse:  Nino Graye]

Yeah, yeah, yeah
The picture's on the corner
By the bank waitin to make the ins
I take a step to the curb
Heard a person yell "Take his bread!"
Searchin' for the problem
I got him right when he made a left
On the street in a Jeep
Seen him tryin' to break his neck
Passin' off and pack to the back of the cab
Cappadonna's drivin'
I feel these stupid motherfuckers eyein'
We pack stilettos and black metal
Plant one in your chest
Watch your back open and bloom like flower petals
But they bogus I know it they keep rollin'
Maybe they see him playing
Bronze in a van with the door open
Just grinnin'
Waitin' for Bis and 80 to make withdrawals
Cut the phones drop the workers, take it all
Walk out the front door, we all made off
Just like Bernie, fuck a jury, raise hell til they burn me

[Third Verse:  Planet Asia]

Yeah
Hi-end fascist splashin'
Lone wolf baby in a stroller
Style cobra
Super Ninja solar with soldier
Gold chain code of conduct
Million dollar plots flood my Motorola
Get it at all costs
This is a movie about a mob boss
Ice [?] Mafia illegal yard cross
Medallion is mural
Money exchange strange dinero
We back on the block spending nothing but Euros
Stashin' a box:
Hash, Glocks, gloves, a machete, Koran
A couple black mask and a top
We transform like robots
Run up on you with guns for fun
Extort every member part of your co-op
I let the K scream for say supreme
In the street chasin' fiends
This is the lifestyle that Jason bring
Na-mean?
My military regime fuckin' over your whole team

[Fourth Verse: Canibus]

Germaine's quatrain
Modern day Mark Twain
Heating up a golden fin shark soup of lo mein
Burn Hollywood, burn
Motherfucker wait your turn
I flick the ash from the sherm in the urn
Never argue with crazy people, you're gonna lose
I sit in my room and watch the magnetic north move
Jog the place until my shoe soles rip off
And just replace it with a moleskin offa my wall
I'm a writer so I write things down
I try to live life righteous
But I can't right the wrongs right now
So do not stand at my grave and cry
I am not there because I did not die
I don't care what you focus on
I was drawn to the [?]
Killah Priest told me  [?] Capricorn golden arms
Blacker than the upper torso of the onyx statue
That belonged to Saddam
Locate the Star Gate five minutes before it close
A black hole force from a source code
10,000 mile an hour indicated speed
My space trap barrel rolls 90 degrees
I press right left pedal flair auto rotation midair
I wade through the meteors in the atmosphere
I'm Woody Harrelson on top of the mountain
Shoutin', "Praise the god of Rastafari fountain!"
[Sedia justoria?] they carry the warrior
From Astoria New York to Africa Pretoria
Listen in the vertical horizon, an audio slave
"She was the best you ever had, Germaine"
I'm a futuristic gap-teethed Bokeem Woodbine
Call weather predator, 2Pac of good times
Life is just a serious of patterns til the cycle is broken
My mind is open my thoughts are born
The word is spoken I am the chosen
God damn suspense, so far
One-way trip to Cassiopeia
Shit rolls downhill, rainwater drops on my head
Chip's on my shoulder, that's how I feel
