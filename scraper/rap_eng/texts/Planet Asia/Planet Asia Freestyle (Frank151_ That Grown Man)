[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
I live the rap life and smoke weed to calm my nerves
These songs I heard make me want to bomb you nerds
I hang with niggas that still serve blind, sniffing bitches
For millions, rocking twenty-thousand-dollar rings with ill furs
Speak, my clique rising like mutual funds
And fuck [?]—all I want is [?] and guns
Like it or not, whoever said, “Asia ain’t street”
Can eat meat ‘cause I even got it popping in Greece
[?] to own niggas with a style that’s fleece
I’m an out-to-own cat with all sorts of receipts
Crossing your beats with no remorse, scorching the streets
Pull out my horsemeat, force it in, tossing your freak
Unfortunately, she ran into the scorpion speech
And wasn’t looking both ways when she was crossing the street
I only hit the holes with the hair less than a week
You know my recipe.  Just bless me and gargle my testes
My clique rock gadgets like computers on wristwatch
My shit cocked, shook niggas turning to Hitchcock
My hip hop circling global to disk jocks
Big props—not only that, a nigga get big knots
I heard y’all couldn’t wait ‘til my shit dropped.  That’s right
Dawg.  Here come the niggas with that West Coast hip hop
Triple-X, monsterous rap.  Life As It Is the LP
Now rushing stores ‘cause real niggas is back
