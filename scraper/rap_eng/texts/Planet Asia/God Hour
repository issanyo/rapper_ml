Uh, my Lord, my darkest hour

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Breaking bad, ride out the box
A little manish motherfucker out the sandbox
Born commander, Harachi Santa Clara posse shit
Tomahawk, Edison, Tiger Bomb Habachi fish
C'mon watch me fish for the math
Fist full of cash my Anunaki clique
Pistol whip faggots who keep the documents
We at the end of the Book, apocalypse
What you rocking with? God or the Devil?
Either one of the opposites, rocking shits no accomplishment
I'd rather rally tropes and set the valley loose
With niggas with attitudes with some consciousness
And sponsorship, holler god, got a squad for [?]
Islam and Amistad for [?] god and young horse

[Hook: AA Rashid]
Knowledge is the power, rolling up the equal
It's the god hour leaning on this beat
Let's build a tower, the real kush is African
Trigger with pretendo, reggie is for cowards

[Verse 2: AA Rashid]
Boogie down seduction, profound instruction
Fine art functions, Stevie and the visions
Princeton in the prison
Sparford in the Harvard, all God's children
Foam building fillings
Ghosts face the ceiling, knuckles in the building
Sacrifice a lizard, chickens and them gizzards
Feeding all the spirits, drunk off the lyrics
Leader of a New School, hyper for new Spliff
Bust me a Rhyme, fill me a new clip
Erase all your memories, feel no misery
Virgin Island flosser, chilling with the rastas
Bad boys called up
P's all winged up
Rux with the Teddy, sweaters all cleaned up
[?]
Three sixes triple up now you can address me
Gene's in the family
You can ask Nore
Fat cat Tony

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tristate]
Ayo, Battlestar Galactica
Mastermind a massacre for passengers
I prophesized a pilgrimage to Africa
The Don Juan DeMarcos rock retro zapatos
My arch know, you better have the cheese for my nachos
[?] militant dogs are so significant
Cause whirlwind patterns of thought could build a pyramid
[?] in your village
Pillage in the spirit of the spirits
Word to the legacy of Dilla
To Hootie Mack, Suene Black Panther with a tooley strapped
Motherfuck them goofy raps, we tryna bring Tookie back
Gangbangers slang slash conscience
Let's start a conference full of mad niggas out the projects

[Hook]
