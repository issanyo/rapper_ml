Uh huh
We're here for that, nigga
Yeah
I ain't come for no throne, either
I already got that
It's in the backyard, nigga

Yo

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
New money
For filling in the vault
Landlord of the loft
Sky diving, this is diamonds for thoughts
Murder therapy
Killer serial, grandma zodiac, marry me
Merry misery happily clapping me
Swallow this black jewel, I mack moves
Maneuverable Gat smooth, lubricant crook
Watching my cash move
Max jewel and you're cool
Allah school, golden cloth
Memorising my darts
That's on the charts, I lapped you
Fall back, you wack, dude
I'm international, my mouthpiece
Smashing everything when I pass through
Respect to the flyest
You niggas got fat last year
Welcome to the drought
I'm handing out diets, yeah
Medallions clear and I can tell you niggas is eating pork
We got you rocking fucked up gear
The underground is mine, it's redesigned
As far as rap go, at this point in time it just got redefined

[Chorus]
I suggest save your breath
Shut up!
We thought it ain't none left
If I was you, I'd take ten steps
Back up!
You about to lose your neck

I don't want to fuck you up
But I will
Don't make me fuck you up
I don't want to fuck you up
But I will
Don't make me fuck you up

[Verse 2: Krondon]
Fine dime, kush mode
Fuck a tub, push bro
In the hood with dogs and locs
Cherrylacks, 100 spokes
Bitches don't want to broke
Barefoot, chilli boat
Pimp in the Pontiac GT '84
Police pursuit, paranoid prostitute
Break bread, birds just suck a cock, cockatoo
Cape like Canaveral, the Coca-Cola partel
Quit using Motarolla, Singular and Nextel
New buck Air Force
Fitted like an Air Force pilot
In a plane, too high to fly it
Purple weed pirate, puff to the boat flow
Out of the city somewhere on an island
You ain't got the heart of a lion, you lying
You eyes ain't water and you crying, nigga
Devil lean doing the designing
And you, you just do the wearing and the buying, nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Planet Asia]
Yeah
Welcome to the luncheon
Big shit, fizzle medal
Now that's dickhole in your smashmouth pumpkin
We backfucked every nigga that raps with HR shit
Slight perm to a permanent nap
Rich bitch medallions, Fidel Muammar Gaddafi
Osama been rhyming since the era of the Nazi
Stop with the pop up what
Smoke the whole club out
Swear to God I fuck a rental cop up
This is Fresno's finest
Shouts to all the killers and crooks
You niggas know what it is, let's gain knowledge
Melodic massare, MAC-11 in the Accura rap
Your brain is like top rhyming on the spatula
Bathrobe batchelor
SAS is the west
Gold Chain evinces a threat
Nobody rhyming after us
Nigga, you track suck, you wack butt, you not hot
Shitting on you like we ate a whole box of laxatives

[Chorus]
