[Verse 1:  Vinnie Paz]
My name Vinnie Paz, cousin and I carry respect
I'm the puppet master, you a marionette
I ain't met a muhfucker that could challenge me yet
Fuck a bitch, I'm a G, I'ma marry my TEC
Paz is a vet, y'all always been struggling with him
And my gun side by side, a juxtaposition
And your man from the block with the drugs in his system
You was just grinding with him, you was hustling with him
He a snitch, he a bitch, you ain't bubbling with him
He in the precinct telling them your current position
I don't be around snitches, I will punish the victim
I don't be around bitches, put a slug in his vision
Money over bitches, that's an actual fact
Mossberg pump through the stomach, that'll be that
It appeared and it disappeared, magical gat
And the Walther PPK splatter your cap

[Verse 2:  Bronze Nazareth]
Heyo my name Bronze Naz and I erupt with a vengeance
Engineers chains of thought, scramble shells and position
Big bold grandma high priced cess like gold hammers
Shadow boxing with myself so first man on the camera
Pistol lyric click the hero, jail chamber Wayne manor
Lock the toxic, I smash baby ground piano
Throw 'em in damaged wells, eat bars spit whole cells
So fast my blast propel bullets through they own shells
By reburbishing shots twirling through steaming your teapot
Split the single blade of grass plotted on your sandlot
I'm the sun Sangria smock, hot like coals in lake lock
Ancestral slavery smokin' open shamrock
Pull Rapunzel through the window, instead of climbing them goldilocks
Not 16 bars hope you shots house drinks
A mouth blinks, slugs flow through a Knox
Poison rivers that erode known to leave you in a box
Decomposed no fingernails from scratchin' the top
Clappin' assassins run the lots 'til the punishment stop
Crushin' your life til out the sunlit OPs
Like forensics trace blood on the mic Mr. 5 Dots
Sickle-cell like W's discovered in my blood clots

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Rap music watchdog, resisted all odds
Rip the Jacker's balls bigger than Nimrod's
Trapped in this body, stuck in this shell
All that is life is not all that ends well
Life's a bitch, karma is boomerang spinnin'
Back to the Akashic vault where everything is written
I created this on the eve of the world's destruction
Read it for yourself, learn yourself somethin'
The NEAT comet defeated the promise and unseated the prophet
When disaster strikes a black man's pockets
They say greed is good because greed fosters growth
But too much growth is not good, you can't have both
Death moves with dehydrated goons in sand dunes
Lookin' at the moon rubbin' wound against wound
We plant crops with heirloom seeds, GMO's give you disease
How many water acquifers you need?
We got birds in the background, can't go back now
Rich people in mountainous regions, poor people on flat ground
World leaders lyin', tryin' to hide their ethnic bias
Encouraging crisis, driven by riots
They orchestrate this with passion, allowed this to happen
It's all fucked up, that's why I stopped rappin'
The predator mimics the traits of the prey it attracts
I lay in wait for the day it attacks
At the end of the day they always said what they wanted to say
And betrayed who they wanted to betray

[Verse 4:  Planet Asia]
I'm an artist from Cali you know
Who truly knows how to spit and keep a crowd lit when doin' a show
But this time we brought best in guns, you ain't my homie and
Don't make me show you how the West was won
These jewels is mental, your jewels is rental
My goons eat your food and your dude's lentils
Style was a blessing of sound, cows stay golden patrolling these grounds
I do this for the lost and found
Medallions murder, yeah we on that again
Battlin' niggas for earnings, servin' up the calvary
This is central fish, pink salmon on a dish
Blowing smoke with a backwards split
It's like this, a propane flow with some cocaine dough
Now that's gold chain ho, now you know
I did it for the world
And my bond is my word
