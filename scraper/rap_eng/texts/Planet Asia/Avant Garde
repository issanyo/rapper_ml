[Verse 1]
I'm just searching for that perfect note
Ain't nothing gory in my story
Just a bunch of dope
Listen mommy it's power in the P
Fresh fit photo shoot puffing sour in the D
They mad 'cause I'm shining god
PA medal aka Island God
Its not a facade but you can get beat up and robbed
But still the mind state of Master Fard
I'm on my job with these one stops
Mama told me knock ya'll niggas out
And I got one shot
I appeared with my gun cocked
Pirates from (?) block
Shout out to my old school yard
(?) monkey ass mind if Imma stop
Ya'll dudes are outta style
The soundtrack was scored by Planet, Apollo Brown
Some shit you haven't heard before
Exclusive air max, off top this shit is raw
As if I took the condom off and went bareback

[Hook]
This for my niggas that buy shit
Spend your money god I'm all about the fly shit
Everything crispy and sharp
Avante Garde, we're making history with the art
This for my niggas that buy shit
Spend your money god I'm all about the fly shit
Everything crispy and sharp
Avante Garde, we're making history with the art

[Verse 2]
This is Coltrane, gold chain
Doctor Strange pocket change
Political power be fucking with the stock exchange
Fine fabric, divine rhyme a killa cabinet
See me in a flick posing in a hundred carats
Niggas is parrots
Saying shit is classic when obvious what's apparent
The sample was stripped without a clearance
The essence, four-finger rings, my half moon crescent
Hoppin' out the Tesla making rapper gestures
I'm under pressure just to get my extras
You're just a heckler
The fruit of my own think it was sacred nectar
My demonstrations out here breaking records
I had to take my blessing
Long as I'm getting cake I'm acing tests
Hitting like Hank Aaron
This is anti-emotional music
I'm not the type to wake a fake care and
On behalf of my DITC I did it for my species
Catch me with a duffle, a couple of EPs

[Hook]
This for my niggas that buy shit
Spend your money god I'm all about the fly shit
Everything crispy and sharp
Avante Garde, we're making history with the art
This for my niggas that buy shit
Spend your money god I'm all about the fly shit
Everything crispy and sharp
Avante Garde, we're making history with the art

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah
This the type of shit that need to be in a museum man
At the Louve in Paris or something man
You feel me
Yo this is like something else man
You know what I mean
