[Intro: Planet Asia]
Pegz what up!
You all know who it is man
Yeah, it's Planet Asia medallios
Yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Titanium tanks, potrown shots, Iranian shanks
Platinum plates, ate to the face off grapes
Eat off cake, digging in the crate, spitting in your face
Shitting on your tape, fit this on my waste - let's motivate
See me in a soldier state, hardcore, hard body shit
Flow that's obviously the most worthy to politicing
If this was college I'd be riding on a full scholarship
Niggas acknowledge this, I'm more hotter than hollow tips
Forever on some rival shit, bitches swallow dick
From herb rats to model chicks, crack babies to cosmic kids
I start writing once I feel the buzz
And if you was high as me then you'd know how real this was

[Hook: Pegz & Planet Asia]
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
It ain't nothing like diligent music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
It ain't nothing like gold chain music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
It ain't nothing like diligent music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like

[Verse 2: Vents]
Vents and the Pegz, it better be loud, I rhyme mentally foul
Facts is hard to swallow like Pedigree Powell
You mad but every time I'm in it you get a feeling
I'm a blood and my style compressed to three minutes, huh
Or you can feel it like a kick in the nuts
Or losing your loved one, the lumps up in the guts
So you're, selling the drugs right up in your house
Come home, me took the television set and the couch
My flows have got a definite bounce, to get your head
Banging like satiricon, Vegabons sing along
Mat-o-fact bring it on
We could get it on like Lebanon 'til we're both dead and gone
Put the record on blast and let yourself
Free 'cause tomorrow keeps swelling in the past
There ain't nothing like diligent music
Your favourite record bro, guess who produced it

[Hook: Pegz & Planet Asia]
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
It ain't nothing like diligent music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
It ain't nothing like gold chain music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
It ain't nothing like diligent music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like

[Verse 3: Pegz]
From the streets of Adelaide to St. Kilda Puram
Loved by mothers, respected by villianous gangs
Feared by bigotted cats and ignorant trash
Like leaders of a right-wing political branch
We resonate through indigenous camps
To the bedrooms of working-class kids from the flats
Without the layered effects or filtering facts
We're all children of the same lost immigrant's fam
Don't let the media deliver the plan
Subliminal brain waves got you swinging a flag
Six o'clock got you feeling with angst
Ten-thirty's like "sweet dreams honey", who killed the romance?
Pegz and Planet Asia fill the expanse
Chemically saturate your compillary glan
Bringing it back, lyrically fulfilling the fans
Like hip hop's number one diligent man, it goes

[Hook: Pegz & Planet Asia]
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
It ain't nothing like gold chain music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
It ain't nothing like diligent music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
It ain't nothing like gold chain music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
It ain't nothing like diligent music

[Outro: Planet Asia]
