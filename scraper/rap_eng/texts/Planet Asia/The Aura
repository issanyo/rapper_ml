[Verse 1]
Cali crook heist leader
Evil eye glaze hunter
Peace to my wave-runners
Iceberg mafia made gunners
My art spirals
Burning up my arch rivals
I'm part wizard and part rhino
Overseas, my hundred dollar vinyl
It's final
Lambo race, Miami space, scarred face
High-speed chase
It's dual-exhaust your whole face
Halal tuna in Laguna
Rumor is he used to be a shroomer
How his mind is psychedelic with humor
I'm an OG but still a junior
I took an Uber to Laguna to meet with the Uma
Sea bass garlic, we mash harlots
Crash parties, white bitches sniffing lines screamin'
"That's gnarly!"
Coconut oil, my bitch is loyal
Peanut-butter skin, cinnamon Shiva queen
Exotic empress
My nine platted circle
My virtue is universal after curfew
This is real life, nothing commercial
Wove a wonderful web, ghetto celeb
The legend of the Buddha in the rain
Protected by the cobra head
I want my king sun, wing chum, my kingdom
Supreme blood, niggas better bring guns
Niggas better bring guns
Anchovies nigga

[Chorus]
It's more than what I write
I meditate, you can see my aura in the light
From the morning to the night
We levitate, smoking, hitting corners in the night
Everything will be alright
If you meditate, you can see your aura shining bright
I'm Osiris with the sight
So get it straight, because it's more than what I write

[Verse 2]
I like to go vote, shock 'em like electrical volts
It was funded offa Mexican dope
Enough cream to cop weapons and boats
At the festival on the float
Hoes tryna get next to the G.O.A.T
And to the chopper now lounging at the lamb market
Sparking it down
My goons howling like wolves on the prowl
Fuck a black and mild
Just some yak and some loud
A little roughie and fries
Me and all of my wives, African style
Moves is smoother than Tai chi
Sugar Ray Leonard, Muhammad Ali
Aston Martin colored tie iced tea
Wardrobe world war three
My monopoly
Culinary king, cookin' crack
Something properly
Fuck love and touch
Something to snut
Get it crackin' or
Suffer the consequences for your actions
The hoes choice was in the Rolls-Royce
The jeweler had me get appraisal for the gold voice

[Chorus]
It's more than what I write
I meditate, you can see my aura in the light
From the morning to the night
We levitate, smoking, hitting corners in the night
Everything will be alright
If you meditate, you can see your aura shining bright
I'm Osiris with the sight
So get it straight, because it's more than what I write
