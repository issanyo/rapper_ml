Uh huh, got to get that dough, man
*That's on me*
This is the shit, right here
Niggas is going to cop this one
*That's on me*
Everywhere I go, they going to be talking about Planet Asia
Put that on everything
*That's on me*
You know what I'm saying
Got the hottest shit ever

'Til I D-I-E
I'm repping F-C
And I'm a do my thing, nigga
That's on me
It's for my G-O-Ds and all the old Gs
We're about to get this money, nigga
That's on me
A lot of y'all just want the fame, 'cause you be acting strange
So now you get some change, nigga
That's on me
Can't even come back to the same place where you was raised
Without ducking them strays, nigga
That's on me

All hail the honourable
It's not a show, it's phenomenal
I make street niggas say "That's my kind of dude"
Now spark the chronicles
My art part of your party
Part of your suffering
I do this shit for everybody
For bookworm brothers to niggas holding heavy shotties
Once it's on, we run up in your home like the federalies
Straight off of Treasure Island, never smiling
Perform the most genius, and that's between me and some medicali
Just like juvie bouncing back, well here's another album
And once I put it out, just add it on to your genre
Fuck the crown, give me the honour, persona, dollars and marijuana
You got rappers rocking body armour
I weather the storm and wet up nannas
With a conscious effort
I'm just trying to better my karma
And I put that on everything, relax on me
Because if you want to get your title took, that's on me

[Chorus]

Spitting fire for the higher ankh, breathing drama
You never seen a don get over in your life
Speaking illegal jargon
Packing a MAC-10 for rats and bastards
Blow the shottie, bullets passing through your body like natural gasses
Niggas is 85% bent
10% bamboozled and tricked
Dismissing the 5%
I brought it back to the beginning like my first appearance
Lyrics Planet Asia vaunts a culture out of perseverance
Y'all niggas might as well be rocking purses
More like a box of Hershey's
Feminine like hospital nurses
Soft as a Nerf is
Like I said before, never hear me rhyme without a reason
Got to serve a purpose
These are words to purchase
Straight out of universes
The G-O-D in the square speaking in third person
Splurge with the merging
West side still standing with me
Because they love the way I come through churching

[Chorus]

Y'all can't fuck with this dude right here
And if it's war, then my niggas don't fight fair
Forever, always hood shit strictly
And now I've got the whole city rolling with me

PA's back on some old free range rap
And real hip hop is when you see the DJs scratch
And bust like I'm holding the Gat
Over the track, I'm too good for my own good and that's that
Roll through my hood and get yap
Individually jacked, make your whole memory lapse
Canadian Black, world tour, stadium packed
Battle with the axe, no government, no tax, that's crack

[Chorus]
