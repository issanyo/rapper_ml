-Chorus
"Bar Season
Cold outside/
We sippin' brown, this is how we get down/ (when we fly around this)
Nice women with nice features
This is the life
Take a second to soak it in/
You're only this young once so serenate/
XO's on the house
100 dollars a shot
Lets pop/
Bar Season
Cold outside/
We sippin' brown, this is how we get down/

-Planet Asia
(Ey yo) brown water event
Sizzlin my leaf bout to hit the valet/
Grand entrance
My presence Cali/
The only one rockin the valleys like, "they came out this year"/
Complicated wonderin what coast I come from/
Jewel from the gentleman school/
I keep them eyeballs runnin reckless
Handcuff your harlots when I come through/
Rims look right when they wet/
Plus the P is gillette/
Please
Ya steeze got on free selectin'/
Yak section, sparkling glasses/
Chicken on ice, remy nights
Tickling fancies and she/
Top notch on scotch, watch me dazzle and swoop/
No hard feelings if ya' bitch get knocked/
It's all in the game, toast to it, boast to it simp/
Blow some notes to it, wrote to it just to keep it lit/
Blow some smoke to it, (note to my niggas gettin bent)/
We got, remy on the house, shots of henny for 50 cent/(this is...)

-Chorus
Bar Season
Cold outside/
We sippin' brown, this is how we get down/ (when we fly round this)
Nice women with nice features
This is the life
Take a second to soak it in/
You're only this young once so serenate/
XO's on the house
100 dollars a shot
Lets pop/
Bar Season
Cold outside/
We sippin' brown, this is how we get down/

-Tri State
(check it)
Skip the clear talk, dark only/
KFC on the rocks, we dont bottle pop phonies/
Premium grey, top shelf, sippin' that/
Cirque du soleil, the whole house flippin out/
Get a whiff of this flow, finesse pro/
Stretch dough, your multiple loafs, now let's toast/
To the plus seats and woodgrain dashes/
Fly-petite-pretty physiques' with mean asses/
Real bossin', never disrespected/
Haters move with caution, we are well connected/
Plan perfected, time to celebrate/
Black magic backwoods, this is how you levitate/
Without a flight, take whatever you like/
In this fan-fare fair it's happy hour for life/
And the party dont stop when bacardi on stock/
Maserati's on the lot, on to the next spot/(this is...)

-Chorus
Bar Season
Cold outside/
We sippin' brown, this is how we get down/ (when we fly round this)
Nice women with nice features
This is the life
Take a second to soak it in/
You're only this young once so serenate/
XO's on the house
100 dollars a shot
Lets pop/
Bar Season
Cold outside/
We sippin' brown, this is how we get down.../"
