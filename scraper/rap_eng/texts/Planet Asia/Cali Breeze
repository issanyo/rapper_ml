[Planet Asia]
Cali Breeze, Planet Asia
Cali Breeze
Through the mist, I stays true to this
No matter what the opportunist consuming, confuse me not wit foolishness
I stand on earth as the Asian beneficant
Vocalist, don't wanna focus cuz the brokest ones be the best rappers
To keep you listenin, but still that ain't true
Cuz you can make a million bucks and still all praise due
To the highest degrees, I manifest to be the flyest MC
My final chapters you been dyin to see
Cali Breeze, male and fishy cuz these cats be killin big fish
For small change, dyin off without eatin the big dish
Witness life at its worst, evident witness at the finest
I Timex raps to keep my stats at a climate that's cool
Cats only climax cuz cats make sense
Cuz how the fuck you 'bout to MC when you can't make rent
For shelter, so keep it movin if your goal in life is shiesty
I hold the mic for days cuz rhyme pays, quoted by Ice-T
Precisely, I patternize thoughts that's frightening
Sometimes I drops lightning on the poisonous minds
I run the lines like Rasco but blown off hash though
G's for Cali Breeze cuz my steez is cash flow
And now you know the deal when Planet Asia's on zone
Lockin shit down forever massive and we keepin shit sewn

[Hook] A
It's a day to life struggle that bends the pavement for cheese
Cali Breeze, let me put you up on Central Valley steez
These cool cats camouflage through the hay
And we can tell if you's a snake just by the look on your face

[Hook] B
It's a day to life struggle that bends the pavement for cheese
Cali Breeze, let me put you up on Central Valley steez
These cool cats camouflage through the hay
And if you don't know the deal that you's about to get laced

[Planet Asia]
I be the major microphone that's on a mission for chips
In this game of life of survival, man I'm tryin to get rich
Fuck tryin to penny-pinch, endin up penny-less
Hollering bout you underground but really your shit sounds the most trendiest
I write rhymes like morning articles
My particles startle like terrortists takin hostages on Greyhound charters
Smoother than Collagen Elastin
Knowledge and pass when
I used to fantasize about fame, dollars, makin shit happen
Was my wish made true? My visions became the view
Cuz if it wasn't for my dreams I wouldn't rock it for you
Hip hoppin for you, droppin Cali when I socks it to you
Daily elevations the ritual, my conscience is true
From out the calm breeze climate, Cali palm trees alignment
Of gestures, generates words to execute assignment
Foreign, world wide tourin, naturalistically explorin over-seas
Planet Asia, Cali Breeze
