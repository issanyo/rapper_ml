This is it yo that I live my life
On the mic is my type of hype
Yeah it's only right

[Planet Asia]
One for the preciseness
Two for all my fuck ups
Three for all the Slick Rick niggas who stay trucked up
It's all street
Heavy metal hip-hop
For every ghetto
Fuck what you heard we 'bout to bring this shit to Wall Street
Flow financial
With authority to spark it on charts
While you couldn't get a stop up at the flea market
You wholesale
Damn near no sale
My flows is mansion and a yacht, yours is roach motel
And don't get it confused, we still in this for the art of it now
I puts it down for all the O.G.'s who started this
But yeah we in this for what we deserve
And Planet Asia's got the heads comin' back for second servings
Like 'Who want some?'
I got it for ya'll
With my crew up, by my lonesome
We could go some
Now what's the haps of what your sayin' best be ready to throw some
I blow so much trees I had to grow some
Killers, criminals, crooks - I know some
This rhyme was written for
All my hip-hop niggas across the globe
Worldwide, tuned in, this is who I'm spittin' for
But yet times is changin'
Cats is still bangin' and shit
Set trippin', and throwin' up their sign language
But we gonna show you how it's properly done
Lights, Cameras, ah ah, Action

This is it yo
No more than the 1-4 bout the fate
Confrontation of a dream I used to contemplate
Greatest ofter on the planet with the ghetto twist
Versus the inner child that now knows they never wish
You gotta exercise caution when you using words
It ain't enough that every unspoken thought is heard
And I was fresher than the image that was ???
God is grand, not for purposes of tyranny
This is it yo the freedom that I knew was coming
Justice is in activity, this is your summons
Spot a short stroll from the cradle to the grave
Just keep your boots laced you in the company of knaives
That's always and forever on a heat wave tip
I first found mastery when as a beat slave
I was brought before a jury of my own fears
For lyin' to myself was sentenced to a wasted year
I did that and did a prime return into the microphone
Made a vow that I'mma never leave this life alone
And got busy revolutionising rap with awareness
The closest to a battle rap you hear is this
Odds fear now the hustle up a couple cell
But I don't need some customers I need a Clientele
I need conspicuous of land mass and the navy
To roll wit me should the need arise to go crazy

[Planet Asia]
Verbal warfare,the fiend of the mic
Ready to strike you with the stardard
So understand this is what we live our life for
Beats, rhymes street tales are down to puberty
Sticks you to shame uplifting the black community with culture
Cause this is how we wild on feds
Y'all better chill and get grilled just like salmon steaks
On the mic I'm something vicious always on point
Like period, that's why the Dj's be playing the joints
Spittin' precisely, straight from the heart
To the last rawkus man I will forever rule the underground charts
That's on the yard
Y'all cats and get dealt with quickly
On the real so just chill while I blaze another fifty

[Grand Agent]
This is it yo the part where the rapper gets self righteous
What be goin' on inside to make me rhyme like this
Maybe I'm Jehovah's witness just another Joseph
Known as the father of it though my father wrote it
It's a sweet gig with a social life that's sour
They approach the very hour that you come to power
Some be comin' jus' to stone me and curse me man
The best weapon I could have at that point is mercy
For far too many clout came in the after life
But if you hate me and I know it then that's half the fight
The rest is knowin' that you hate me cause I won your heart
And I'mma own it 'til me and my body come apart
