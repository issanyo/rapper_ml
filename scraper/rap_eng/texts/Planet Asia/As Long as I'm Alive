[Planet Asia]
Yeah, this to all the people in my life
That's restin in peace, y'knowhatI'msayin?
Here to let y'all know that y'all give me inspiration to do what I do
And I ain't never gon' forget you, knahmsayin?
For as long as I'm alive

[verse One]
For all my peoples gone... from nine to five
As long as I'm alive my niggas we gon', be strong
Now peep the song, the streets is gone, to each his own
From money spent to every song that I was featured on
It's for the block and we gon' keep it goin
For all my close friends gone, givin me energy to speak my poems
Rest in peace to the God Al Woods
Kept my self-esteem high since a child in the hood
I was raised on the Westside, wildin for goods
Same cats that used to kick it now be killin each other
Comin from different neighborhoods and not feelin each other
The way they used to loud talkin, last words is nigga I'll shoot you
The streets is eighty-five, cause nowadays you might get
Popped in the back at the party tryin to flee to survive
For all my friends that travelled to the other side
You'll be forever on my mind as long as I'm alive

[Chorus]
(As long as I'm alive) Tell all my homies that I'm
Lost in the storm, I'ma keep it movin on
(As long as I'm alive) You'll always have a piece of my heart
Piece of my mind, and a peace of my art
(As long as I'm alive) You shall forever be mourned
I'm thinkin bout y'all every mornin
(As long as I'm alive) I shall never forget
The good times and all the places we went

[Verse Two]
In high school you was my closest homey, although from different crews
We used to chop it up bout all the shit that we was into
From girls to guns, and situations in our circle
And it hurts everytime when I think about the day they merked you
You left a lonely spot
Broke down when I heard it like damn why they have to leave the homey shot?
My fond memories are commonly remembered
Good times and in my mind it's like I speak to you spiritually
And to my favorite Uncle Franklin Harper
You shall never be forgotten for as long as I'm alive and talkin
Inside a soul darkened, due to circumstances
These past years done had some friends of mine who died from cancer
It's messed up never knowin your chances
And Tammy I wish you was here so you could see how much we been advancin
And your management is much missed, but I know you watchin
Rest in peace, little Ann George and Les Watson
And I'll gladly sing this song with pride
Cause all y'all forever in my heart as long as I'm alive, you hear me?
I'll gladly sing this song with pride
Cause all y'all forever in my heart as long as I'm alive

[Chorus]

[samples from the movie "Juice"]

[Planet Asia speaking over samples]
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Your memory'll live on, with me you can trust
Dust to dust and ashes to ashes
You're on my mind more for sure as time passes

[Verse Three]
Sometimes I find myself stressin, then realize at least I'm livin
So as long as I'm alive, it's for y'all I'm reppin
Until I'm back to the essence, and if it wasn't
For half of my peoples gone I probably wouldn't practice my profession
From all the gunfights, and white chalk, funerals wakes and white cops
Lockin my niggas soon as the night pops off
Nowadays gotta be strong to survive
But I be representin my peoples as long as I'm alive

[Chorus]
