[Intro: Planet Asia talking]
Ayo, ayo Chops. Let's count this money. I think we got about...I'd say about 43 million...in loose cash. Check it out

[Verse One: Planet Asia]
Peep out the fresh shit
Grainy grey Benz out the press kit
Devastate through your neighborhood, something treacherous
Specialist out for warehouse money
Relax and count stacks and don't worry about my necklace
The freshest kids won't even step to this
Cause even weaponless I still control the scene effortless
My pen glorious, you other cats bore me
Just cordially move out the way who cares what your story is
Guess who's number one up in the highlyest, stunter ship one
Your chick wants me to run up in her
When the light flashes I start blinging
Truck jewelry like disco lights across the ceiling
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad you're here
Cause this tune now playing you just had to hear
And this year marks the coming of, something more flashy
So just watch me and look out for Niggarachi

[Hook: Planet Asia]
Niggarachi
You can see it in my clothing
Heavy on the chest, yes my neck stays frozen
Glitter around the wrist too
Every stone lit blue
And this is some more of that shit for you to trip to
Niggarachi
When your chain is all heavy
Your house is decorated, double R [?] belly
And the women all around are ready to rock steady and clock
And when you step in they know you got cheddy

{x2}
All I wanna do is live my life to the fullest
Pocket full of doe, clothes, and sipping on Louis
Ladies move around all the fellas just watch
To the tick tock ya don't stop

[Verse Two: Planet Asia]
For this I was chose to expose what's unknown to young and old
Crews sit back and just roll a stog' to
Something for the summer heat, bump and just roll to
All my peoples up north still riding on gold shoes
You can skirt to the melody but please don't crash
And catch a felony, especially with weed in the dash
And that's word from the Planet so just take the advice
Cause make one false move and you'll be paying the price
And that means no more chilling
Or
Cristal spilling
Or
Buying out the telly floor, suite to top billing
I'm your pappara', Frank Sina', Versace shop, chop a lot of watches
Plus Gucci still suits me in a Bentley drop
Milky in a silky suit, tempt me I'll be simply cute
Even got the hippy dudes yelling out "Yippie doo!"
Make sure you just glace if you chance
Ever comes to mean the man with lots of diamonds and karats
Don't just stand there like a peasant have respect when you see the ruler
My Beamer cruises right up to the cheeba movers
Goodie two shoes to evil doers
Overseas I'm like God, people don't even believe I'm human
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad you're here
Cause this tune now playing you just had to hear
And this year marks the coming of, something more classy
So just watch me and look out for Niggarachi
