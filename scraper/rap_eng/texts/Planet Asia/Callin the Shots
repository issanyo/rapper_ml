Chorus [Planet Asia]
Callin the shots
I came out reppin my block
No town, it don't stop still this street shit pops
Aiyyo, callin the shots
Planet As-Architecht, get the checks cashed quick, we keep the stats thick
We at this and we callin the shots
You thought that you could hold me back
I take this rap game serious, found my niche, I can't switch
Now who callin the shots?
It be the Planet once again, and if even I don't make dollars I can still
Make sense

]From the second you received the message
Bumps the goose, goes your spine from the front
Freezin everything from inside
Now spittin it, gettin it, you can tell cuz how I'm ? in it infinite
I be rippin shit so mothafuckin different
That I trash tracks, I drug mics
I black out, envision slug fights like 'Nam flashbacks
Word perfected poetry pack intact wit the streets just like a link
Missin listen comin back wit some heat
B-boys and girls, DJ's and MC's
To my nine-to-five, hustlas keep doin your thug d's
I keeps a balance in this rap game cuz it's all that I got
And that's simply just what I gave and now I'm callin the shots

Chorus

[Planet Asia]
Now I control my own destin, soul questin
Solo set in the old essence
So when I speak listen close, catch every parable
I'm like history through your stereo, bombin you from aerial
Come on, you clowns know my resume
My ancestory's deep rooted, I feel for those not in my pedig-ree
Another classic for the heads to look back
And be like "When it was 1999, he took that"
And to the haters who thought different
I'm just here to let you know that I'm not here for your interest
It's for my peoples that was down from the start
Who get the cream, but in between, really upholdin the art
My legacy shall be timeless
I transform from demo tapes to whole albums generatin cash on consignment
And you know it'll never stop
Never that pops, I will forever be callin shots

Callin the shots, I came out reppin my block
No town, it don't stop till the street shit pop
Aiyyo callin the shots
Planet As-Architecht, get the checks cashed quick, we keep the stats thick
We at this and we callin the shots
You thought you could hold me back (back)
You thought you could hold me back (back)

Puttin it down for my crown
And underground just for the honor of the culture and beyonder
Ponderin the drama wit thoughts of soldier sagas
Upliftin the bill, I'm fit for the skill, to master self, submit to the will
It's the only challenge, higher self like dealin wit Asia major
Just remember what ya neighbor gave ya
You know this world, that's why everytime in your area
It's Planet Asia's world, you know we flip that, you'll never get a mismatch
Duke
That's how I rip raps, make your squad dispatch too
This that new, School Yard shit, Cali Agent Number 2
Rushin through wit nuttin but plush discussion for you
This is now where the stallin stops, we now ballin for crops
Callin the cops, cuz Planet Asia's callin the shots
And it ain't no fallin pops, cuz we all on the top
In the mall we gon' shop, long cuz we callin the shots
Callin the shots, callin the shots
