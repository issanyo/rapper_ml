[Hook: x2]
It don't matter if its right or wrong
I'ma get my hustle on, you acting like its something wrong
I'm just tryin put my peoples on
Gotta get off that to each his own

[Verse 1]
I'm from the era of medicine bottles are pure
El caminos, leather bombers with furs
Uncle drinking (gallus?) or coors
People knocking at your door for sugar
My play clothes was corduroy jeans
Patches on the knees kangaroos and (opie?)
A young child with a vision of better living, this life
Hoping I never had to end up in prison
Cause in the hoods everybody's guilty, just by association
They way the poles be posted, waiting more like close to hating
But I was taught never fit the description, never tell your business
And when its beef pop extended clips in
Moving intuitive, cause the first street lesson
Usually is watch who you get into it with
Cruising at 10, bulletproof fueling the engine
Now choose a side you either hoeing or pimping
And that's a big difference know the position
Either you Indian or Chief at the podium with soldiers to listen
But yo

[Hook: x2]
It don't matter if its right or wrong
I'ma get my hustle on, you acting like its something wrong
I'm just tryin put my peoples on
Gotta get off that to each his own

[Verse 2]
Park shootouts, dice games, and beat boxing
Hundred dollar double ups it was the street option
Barber shop talk, ya forced to listen
Grown folks arguing, that's how you got your latest sport statistics
Candy houses on every block, hydraulic pickups
Liftin it up with heavy knock, had niggas yellin stick up
When rappin was an art, I had a flattop with a part
But now I rock a kundalini spiral to the top
Fourteen years the same crew, stay true
No need to name a few, just know we payed dues and came anew
Straight out the golden age, real talk before the paper started folding
Hustling's the only culture that we still upholding
Who would of thought i'd be bubbling next, bubbling checks
I got you staring at my character be double X
What you been witnessing is histories making
But before I finish the song there's something you should know

[Hook: x2]
It don't matter if its right or wrong
I'ma get my hustle on, you acting like its something wrong
I'm just tryin put my peoples on
Gotta get off that to each his own

[Verse 3]
As the world keeps turning, dollars we keep burning
Product and politics high checks keep it going
I was born to hustle
All my life I was taught, work hard at it
We was born to struggle
Its been a long time coming but i'm finally here
This how we do it round this time of the year
Moving up from thousandnaires
My version of the streets to blunted fans
I write to inspire one hundred mans, so check it

Sean Don nights, city life, finicky fights
Bag session, broke niggas rock the dingiest Nikes
Was known since the first gang was formed
So through every block I get a pass, even when my chains is on
My path is blessed like multiple choice, Feeling the bubbles like
Driving the vehicle to pass the test, in the flesh of a vessel
Street credibility is unquestionable, and i'm here to let you know

[Hook: x4]
It don't matter if its right or wrong
I'ma get my hustle on, you acting like its something wrong
I'm just tryin put my peoples on
Gotta get off that to each his own
