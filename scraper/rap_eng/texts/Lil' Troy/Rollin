Yo yo this is lil troy niggas we rollin

{Verse1
When i come to the dance them hoes get on the floor, cause they know that boy
Troy dont play no more,them big youngs be off the rocks and ya lynch be like
Water the time for the hit and the roll time be sellin quaters loud beats and

Phat rymes is the key to what im doin im in the mix cause im rich no time for
Niggas ruin

{Chorus
WE be rollin, every day and every nite so keep it tight
We be rollin, Big troy in the place to be yall dont wanna f*** wit me
