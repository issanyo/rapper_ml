[Intro: Diddy]
Ay yo bring me a hundred bottles
It's a lil' dark in here
It's time we light this bitch up
Oh you know we had to do the remix, right?
This is the remix
Oh, it's only right

[Hook: Charlie Rock]
Shorty got potential, I could be her sponsor
Met her back stage at a summer jam concert
Hair like Rihanna, shoe game was awesome
Could tell by her aura, she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller shot caller
Can tell by her aura, she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller shot caller
Can tell by her aura, she want a shot caller

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Dipping in the Phantom, thought they seen a Ghost
Try live life, baby gon' make a toast
All white drop head just me and Flock
My new deal sweeter than Peach Ciroc
I took over the streets didn't miss a block
Did it for NY baby shout to Big and Pac
Can I hit in the condo
Can I hit in the morning like Alonzo?
Shorty got potential, knew I had to stamp her
Ass like Nicki, head like Amber (Coke boy baby)
Coke boy 'til he bury me
R.I.P. to homie Heavy D

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Dipping in a 'Gatti, billboards in Tokyo
Worth about a billi and I still run the city
What you really thought? I wasn't coming through
I invented balling, the shot calling
Ciroc boy, Top 10 hitter
Like she came with a car left the lot with her
Can I hit it on a jet
Be Rex Ryan autograph signing
Shorty kinda flashy, I could be her sponsor
Hair like Cassie, shoe game is awesome
We on that Ciroc, red berry with the red bottom
NY, we the headliners

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Put the coupe on a pair of Chuck Taylors
Bought the block no love for the neighbors
Top down, praying to my Lord and savior
We on the floor, Pacquiao the world's greatest
Boxing niggas all I ever did was mob and weave
Now the crib eight mil, that's on everything
Give me props or keep it real your man hating
Not the crib, she couldn't get past the landscaping
Cranberry letterman I had 'em handmade 'em
Double M Genius, even the band playing
Scarface, 500 inch flat screen
Stack cream, now the Maybach net green

[Hook]
