{Chorus}
When we are at the top them blades go chop, chop, chop
All the time busin rymes when we are at the top them rems go chop, chop, chop
Just listen se how we glisten.(repeat1x)

Verse1 Nas
Yo my boy big troy is choppin the blades ridin teenaged rems on a '02 escalade
See my stelo it brings heat though cause my 9 still gully wit ice im
A hustler 4 life cause my name is nas capital M lil's pass it over to troy my
Hood street is the best

Chorus

Yo you know it my guns pop I dont stop my lyrics is ill plus the J's laced
Locked im a baller baby when it comes to chops a phat house and killer rhymes I
