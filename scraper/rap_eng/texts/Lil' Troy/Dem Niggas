Or they gonna have to face dealing with us

[Ardis]
Im the master mind
Get money leave the past behind
Cause if you fuck me then that ass is mine
I lay down shit
Lil' Troy who I stay down with
Artist im still one thick
He told me to bring it well here it go I run shit
You bustas please i run shit
We authentic time peace ice up to fice up
I'm still here who lights up
Going on somebody turn the lights up
Is the mic up I can't be touched
You got cash well it can't be much you missed us
Im the same one playin me close I told ya it ain't done
I bring the rain if I cock back I'm going to aim one
The thing to ask if I want it I bring the axe
You niggas can't fuck with me
I put it down real so my nigga Troy stuck with me
I cut for him now he cut for me
Grim got the keyboard i got the razor blade to match
I got the levy drop hits on the track

Chorus

[Lil' Troy]
Fuck deem naggas man
Even though I had to front some niggas
I'll take out a bunch of ya niggas
You know I'm Lil' Troy(Lil' Troy)
I dont want any of you niggas
I will kill everyone of you niggas
Why you bumpin cause you moved up to score a half a brick
(a half of brick)
Bitch I move three half a lick (oh)
I.d. you know the rules get your mutherfuckin ass in line
And have my mutherfuckin cash on time
Don't forget who you call when them niggas drink pistol whip
Tied you up and didn't even reason kid (tied your ass up)
I paid the price gill bitch I saved your life
Now your thinking everything's all right
When I caught you off tha soft with a pistol bumpin you all
But then I should bump you off
I ain't sayin no more I know you should start payin me though
Cuz bitch I ain't playing no more

Chorus

[Ardis]
I done down to pull one
Unload a clip popin a good one
You niggas can't fuck with us
This Short Stop baby you ain't got enough of us
You want to bring it ain't shit to me
I roll one deep but you better have a click for me
Cuz if I get crunk I pop the trunk
Im artist thats Troy we both stay nonchalant
You dont know how far our money extend
Pushin tha benz ridin shotgun
Cop twins in case I have to die for the ends
It was a half of a meal
From the jump when he started to burn
One lick was three and a quarter to burn
Throw three hundred in the aisle these niggas full like that
I drink but I dont get full like that
I stay sober when its good for me
And grab my Glock and make sure i put enought on me

Chorus

[Lil' Troy] talking

Yea fuck these niggas
You see what I'm sayin we roll with enough of niggas
And um I'm takin contracts out
Every motherfuckin body that owns somebody in this bitch
You know what I'm sayin come see Lil' Troy
I dont care if you on the east side west side north side or south side
If you a hoe ass nigga im taking y' all ass out for the 99 bitch
