Wanna be a baller, shot caller

But there's got to be a better way!
A better way, better way, yeah

Switched from Motorola to a PrimeCo phone
Broke in two chrome, now you know no dope pigeon
Used to count my spoke, now these hoes count my inches
Had to get older -- man it got colder
I done got grown and got a chip on my shoulder
Links in Kuwait, got links in Pakistan
Boys don't understand virtual reality Caravan
Double doors marble floors naked hoes around me
Everytime I'm comin' out, niggas they wanna sign me
Got the Lil' Will diamond grills in my grin
Blaze in the Benz and you can't forget DenDen
Boobie diamond Ruby's, I'm watchin' on a movie
Drop the top on Scott, and you know I'm in a jacuzzi
Bourbon and I'm swervin', man it's gettin' hot

[Verse 5: Hawk]
I hit the highway
Everything's my way, I parlay
Everyday all day, ain't no way
Boys can't stop as I slide through your neighborhood
Chop chop chop, headed straight to the top
I only play to win -- bout to close up shop
Showstoppin dead end, pimp the pen once again
Peep the message I send
Take these levels that you devils can't comprehend
Big body Benz -- as I floss through the south
Big blue men -- now whatcha talkin about?
Close yo' mouth -- as I settle all scores
Scream and shout -- my similes and metaphors
Mansion doors -- I constantly close
All you hoes -- go and take off your clothes
Lord knows -- ain't no time to play
Commence to fuckin and-a suckin on the H.A.W.K
