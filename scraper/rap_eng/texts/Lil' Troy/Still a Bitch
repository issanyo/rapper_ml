"Bitch wanna die cause she know I caught her lyin!"

[Nattie *singing*]
I met her in a bar outside a little part of Texas
Never know she's sleepin 'round on me
I found about it one night when we were sexin
Cause she accidentally called me Gee
Now you're lyin, fake cryin
Wanna die cause you know you a tramp in my book
Misleadin, steady cheatin
You run the street and you know you a bitch in my book

Now Lil' Jane, I guess that's what we'll call her
Had all the homies goin crazeeee
Had to join a convent, wanted to be a baller
Now the bitch fuck every guy she see
See you a slut and, in the mud and
Havin fun and you're still a bitch in my book
Trampin, soon you die bitch
And that's why you just a bitch in my book

Now I'm livin lost, don't know where my next meal is
Had to try and find a wayayyyy
Cause you left the house and you took everything I deal with
Now bitch I'm wonderin where you stayyy
See you a die-ho, I'll bravo
I'll kill you, still a bitch in my book
Loaded, and smokin
Now I'm blowin, cause you a bitch in my BOOK...

Just a bitch in my BOOK...
This ho is a slut in my booook...

Just a tramp, sick and tired of feedin whores
Everytime I'm walkin down the stree-eeet
And I'm sick and tired, of always seein closed doors
Wanna slap every tramp I meet
See you started, then you parted
Now you bought in, still a tramp in my book
Low-life, do Snow White
Now you crow and you're still a bitch in my book
Know that, I go there
I'll beat you, you still a bitch in my book
Holdin, these .. *cracks up*
