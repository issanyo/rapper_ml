[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Intro]
Commentating, illustrating
Description giving, adjective expert
Analyzing, surmising, musical
Myth-seeking people of the universe, this is yours!

[Hook]
It's yours! Do you like it? (Yeah!) Do you want it? (Yeah!)
Well if you had it, would you flaunt it? (Hell yeah!) Well it's yours!

[Verse 1]
Taking a record that's already made
With the help of a mix board using the cross-fade
Rhythm can be kept to a self-choice pace
Depending on moment or depth of bass
I don't really know, but somebody said
Some musical rhythms can mess with your head
I don't know – if it's true
I leave it up to you – it's yours!

[Verse 2]
Sound plus rhythm done up with finesse
Is equivalent to the adjective “best”
Now it's time to introduce
Neo-rhymes combined with a group with juice
Dance - to the musical tune
On the microphone, gonna make you swoon
T L-A R-O-C-K
Usually the reason for a very nice day
I came here to represent the ultimate act
Which only occurs when the party is packed
So full of endurance, for your insurance
Everything’s fixed, just listen to the mix

[Hook]
It's yours! Breakdown!
Back to the beat! DJ Jazzy Jay!

[Verse 3]
Common talk deserves to walk, the situation’s changed
Everything said from now on has to be prearranged
Definitely, you will agree, just let your mind be free
Relax yourselves, do your dance, this is the place to be, listen

[Hook]
It's yours!

[Verse 4]
Computer programmed with just one finger
Made complete for the chosen singer
Once lyrics are finished, the picture is done
The difference is this picture has no sun
But there's plenty of bright, kaleidoscope light
No color supersedes cause the balance is right
Listeners are pleased cause anxiety is freezed
And can only be thawed when the music is ignored

[Hook]
It's yours!
