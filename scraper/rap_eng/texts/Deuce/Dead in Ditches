[Intro: Deuce]
Fucking faggots
That's when we, that's when we, that's when we ride
That's when we, that's when we ride on these bitches
That's when we, that's when we, that's when we ride
That's when we, that's when we ride on these bitches

[Chorus: Deuce]
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
Don't get us wrong, we only made this song
To make you feel hard when you hit the bong
And when the 40's up and then the 40's gone
To lick shots, kill cops to a hip-hop song
So pull them toasters out them holsters
Pull that shirt right off your shoulders
Pull that nine, this is how you hold her
Pull that trigger, HU soldiers
Punk, rock out on the block
Tick-tock, you cannot stop
Hip-hop like when we drop-top so hot
Johnny 3's been drinking whiskey
Trigger finger feeling frisky
When you shoot, it's so damn risky
Dead in a ditch, but I hope you miss me

[Chorus: Deuce]
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene & Funny Man]
Wait up, hold on, oh no
Got you faggots in a choke-hold
And I think I like you, but my nine sure don't
And how many shots till you hit that floor? I bet four
"Yo Charlie, you're loco"
For sure, how many people dipping in my four-door?
"I see 3"
Bitch no, there's 5 in the back, and your girl's on my lap
She's a down-low, pro hoe for sure
What? What the fuck did I just say?
I don't ask any questions, I just spray
So hey, what I may say may be risque
Deuce made me this way
That's why you don't want no beef
'Cause me verse you is like beat the geek
So we can talk right here or in the street
But my gun talks first 'cause he loves to speak, bitch

[Chorus: Deuce]
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches

[Verse 3: Funny Man & Charlie Scene]
Yo, I'm in the Coupe DeVille with the shiny rims
Playing these bitches like a violin
I got more freaks than a carnival
Pop the trunk, there's my arsenal
I got bats, gats, straps, so let's start a war
I'll eat you alive like a carnivore
My guns need nicotine, they smoke more than me
I'm with my boy Charles P, he'll go to war with me
Ooh, wee, yo King Kong swinging from a tree
Dropping on these haters, so they bleed
I'm coming at you bitches full-speed
"Funny Man, lay off the weed"
Oh, people get jealous when I'm skating on Daytons
And that's like Freddy Kruger hating on Jason
That's got the Funny Man losing his patience
Leave you dead in a ditch on Highland and Franklin

[Ð¡horus: Deuce]
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches

[Bridge: Deuce]
Undead!
What! Say what the fuck!
Six shooters up!
Now, what the fuck?
Point them up!

[Verse 4: J-Dog]
Who's down to ride, who's down to ride?
Undead, pop shots, we're down to die
Who's down to die, who's down to die?
Undead, pop shots, we're bound to ride
Black hat sideways, white-bold "LA"
Flat on your back, leave you smoked like an ashtray
Wig split, face ripped, nod if you're listening
Shot to the cross, leave you dead like a Christian
Pop, pop
Your heart just stops, stops
When I just cock, cock my gun
'Cause I shoot for fun, that's how the west was won
I sell an ounce, and then I sell two more
Then I come to collect with the pistol 44
There's some truth to that about the weed or the gat
You may never know, just leave it at...

[Outro: Deuce]
That's when we, that's when we, that's when we ride
That's when we, that's when we ride on these bitches
That's when we, that's when we, that's when we ride
That's when we, that's when we ride on these bitches
