[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
Sick with myself, but I've got no one else
So I give it to myself, it's the only thing that helps
It's the same thing, this pain thing that keeps me from sleeping
And screaming that, God, I must be motherfucking dreaming
And I can rest in peace and at least cease to be
Cease to see those things in me that make me wanna cease to breathe
And cease to need and cease to feed sickness that's in me
This is all that I can be, I can't breathe as I bleed

[Chorus: Deuce]
I don't know why I cut myself
God, give me a sign or help
I won't cry, it'll be fine, I'll take my last breath
Push it out my chest till there's nothing left
I know that my mind's near the end
God, I hurt myself and fell
I won't cry, it'll be fine, I'll take my last breath
Push it out my chest till there's nothing left

[Verse 2: J-Dog]
Have you ever met a living legend, just a real friend
Who planned his end and where do I begin? You said it was pretend
And when the bullet went through, it took more than just you
It took two, it was you, it was me and suddenly
How could someone stand there helpless and then they act so selfish?
You put me through hell with this, so fuck you, let's just end this
And what about our friendship? Oh, what you did was senseless
You thought you found an exit? Like I said, let's end this

[Chorus: Deuce]
I don't know why I cut myself
God, give me a sign or help
I won't cry, it'll be fine, I'll take my last breath
Push it out my chest till there's nothing left
I know that my mind's near the end
God, I hurt myself and fell
I won't cry, it'll be fine, I'll take my last breath
Push it out my chest till there's nothing left

[Bridge: Deuce & J-Dog]
I just wanna say goodbye
Disappear with no one knowing
I don't wanna live this lie
Smiling to the world unknowing
I don't want you to try
You've done enough to keep me going
I'll be fine, I'll be fine
I'll be fine for the very last time

[Chorus: Deuce]
I don't know why I cut myself
God, give me a sign or help
I won't cry, it'll be fine, I'll take my last breath
Push it out my chest till there's nothing left
I know that my mind's near the end
God, I hurt myself and fell
I won't cry, it'll be fine, I'll take my last breath
Push it out my chest till there's nothing left
