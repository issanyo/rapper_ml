[Verse 1]
You helped me see
When there was so much in me
You helped me believe
When there was something to be
And I don't mind if there's nothing to say
'Cause in the end we'll always be the same
And I don't mind if there's nowhere to stay
'Cause in the end we'll always find our way

[Chorus]
Is this me?
Is this you?
So hard to understand this world
Is it true?
We'll be soon
So hard to understand

[Verse 2]
You helped me see
When there was so much in me
You helped me believe
When there was something to be
And I don't care what you say to me
We'll run away until the sun starts to fade
And I don't care how you look at me
We'll run today until we're far away

[Chorus]
Is this me?
Is this you?
So hard to understand this world
Is it true?
We'll be soon
So hard to understand
Is this me?
Is this you?
So hard to understand this world
Is it true?
We'll be soon
So hard to understand

[Outro]
Is this me?
Is this you?
You helped me see
Is it true?
We'll be soon
You helped me believe
