[Chorus]
I tell em we surpass the limit
This for all my dogs who got cash to get (uh)
Tell them niggas just to pass the cheques
This for all my dogs who got cash to get (uh)
I tell em we surpass the limit
This for all my dogs who got cash to get
This for all my duns who got cash to get
This for all my dogs who got cash to get

[Verse 1]
Yaow
Yaow

Top dog they saying that we living crazy/ ADHD cuz i'm born in the 80's/ paper chasin' i'm trying to find a way to pay me/ and i'm racing consequences they never fazed me/ what the word is I never heard it/ see i murder with urgence/ I'm lurking in shadows i prowl cause i'm searching to murk them/ or i will convert them/ I know you fuckin' heard him I'm around in the city/ and when i'm not around still hold it down in the city/ who hold the crown to the city/ no need cause i take it all for now in the city/ catch me illin' in the west/ anywhere past dufferin or sauga city where I rest/ Rex is where I rep/Jane is where I step/ The game done changed now my aim is for your neck

[Chorus]

[Deuce]
[Verse 2]

Deuce tryna get cash nigga gwala in toronto/ shits easier then tryna sweat inside the sauna/ i'm like future deuce is tryna throw a couple commas/ have a house up in the hills nigga call me deuce osama/ or take over the world nigga i'm the new obama/ i'll do it with my music deucie needs a dj drama/ she knows im in the studio im thinkin' bout my mama/ and when that money flows start drippin' like some water/ couple bands to the one who birthed me i'm indebted/ toronto so with me that its deep inside embedded/ when a nigga blows up i swear i won't forget it/ but if i ever did just remind me that i said it/ fuck I hate banks but i'm tryna build my credit/ bro i need cheques nigga savings and the debit/ adding up my money while my hairs retwisted dreaded/ thinking i just need the cash i know a million ways to get it nigga

[Chorus]

[Prenze]

Yea
Lucini pouring from the sky
Its ya nigga p

Lets get this shit


Cash rules everything around me/ livin in the city got me feeling so filthy/ living in the city got me feeling like a grizzly/ if I fight a bear better help that bear, word to mystikal/ fuck being lyrical, i'm chilling with career criminals/ praying for a miracle,  like Lord, save mee/ all these niggas screaming fuck you pay me/ if the getting is good,  i'm good my nigga/ if the setting is hood, i'm crude my nigga/ in the east side of the city thats where everybody stay/ in the east side of the city thats where everybody paid/ if a camel is an ounce, and a Kufi is a brick/ whats a nigga with a turban and a beard that's kinda thick/ i know i know i know,  astaghfirullaha  /but my youngin Farhan needs a new whip
