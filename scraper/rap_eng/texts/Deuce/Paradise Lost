[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
So watch my chest heave as this last breath leaves me
I am trying to be what you're dying to see
Feel like, "fuck, man, can't take this anymore, this heartbreak, this"
It's this life that's so thankless, how could He just forsake us?
It breaks us, He makes us hate us, He gave us
Nothing but no trust and I am so fucked up
So let this gun bond us, let's hide by this lust
And once we are just dust, He'll know that He loved us

[Chorus: Deuce]
Let it all burn, I will burn first
God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes?
Just let me burn, it's what I deserve
God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes?

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears]
So take me and make me weak and then save me
This hate that you gave me keeps saying the same thing
To sing when you hurt and to sing when you cry
To sing when you live and to sing when you die
And here at the end, at the end of the hurt
All the pain ain't the same when it's your turn to burn
We're the heart for the heartless, the thoughts for the thoughtless
The lies for the honest, we're the gods of the godless

[Chorus: Deuce]
Let it all burn, I will burn first
God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes?
Just let me burn, it's what I deserve
God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes?

[Bridge: Deuce & Johnny 3 Tears]
So cry three tears for me
When it's all gone, sing me this song
So cry three tears for me
When it's all gone, when it's all gone

[Verse 3: Johnny 3 Tears]
I cannot stand who I am, I'm this man
With this blood on my hands, in this blood, I am damned
So watch my wings burn as they burn in the fire
Don't scatter the ashes, no need for the choir

[Chorus: Deuce]
Let it all burn, I will burn first
God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes?
Just let me burn, it's what I deserve
God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes?

[Outro: Johnny 3 Tears & Deuce]
This hate that you gave me keeps saying
Just let me burn, just let me burn
This hate that you gave me keeps saying
Just let me burn, just let me burn
Burn, now, burn
Just let me burn
Now, burn, burn
