[Intro: The Truth]
These fools are never gonna rap again
Yeah, we gon' push all you motherfuckers back
It ain't over till it's over, man
Revenge is like a motherfucker, ain't it?

[Chorus: Deuce]
Love me or hate me, but I ain't stopping till I'm on top
I'm screaming "fuck the world" like 2Pac
Say my name, and you might get shot
It's Nine Lives, motherfucker, till I drop
When the guns go off, they pop
We leave your body outlined in chalk
If you talk, you better learn to walk the walk
'Cause it's Nine Lives, motherfucker, till I drop

[Verse 1: Veze Skante]
They call me Skante Bigante, okay, I'm reloading
Sticks, let the drum spray, damn, that flake got me loaded
Catch a standing ovay, clap till you're up and open
Daddy, bring the heat out, somebody leave the oven open?
Bitch, who you kidding? We be hotter than a sun blaze
So fucking fly, I don't even need a runway
Blunts full of kush, I be steaming till my lungs cave
Gotta, gotta get paid now, fuck someday
Blocks of the chalk and a spoonful of H, aye
Stay with more choppers than the motherfucking HAs
Truth call up Deuce, like "Dude, what it do?"
Look, Pops, for the loot, ain't no telling what I'll do
I cock, aim, and shoot, HU, I see you
No ICU in the world that save you
I be all about the paper, bagging up the yaper
On my barbershop shit, give the brick a taper

[Chorus: Deuce]
Love me or hate me, but I ain't stopping till I'm on top
I'm screaming "fuck the world" like 2Pac
Say my name, and you might get shot
It's Nine Lives, motherfucker, till I drop
When the guns go off, they pop
We leave your body outlined in chalk
If you talk, you better learn to walk the walk
'Cause it's Nine Lives, motherfucker, till I drop

[Verse 2: Gadjet]
You can love me or hate me, I don't give a fuck
What, you trying to date me? Either way, you on my nuts
But whatever you thinking won't stop this superstar
This world is mine to rape, fuck it like stupid groupie broads
Use a magnum extra-large but, ooh, I'd rather do it raw
These pussy, rapping, faggot, sissy bastards really turn me on
And I'm gonna stick it to 'em, man, my dick is getting hard
Fuck 'em all and I'mma prove it while I do it like it's my job
If it is, I stick my dick up in this biz to get it off
While I'm tickling the clitoris by sticking it in soft
Just to trick them like I'm fickle and it's possible I'm fluff
But my dick is quick to switch the brick and give it to 'em rough
I'm a sick and twisted son of a bitch, no disrespect to Mom
But she gave birth to a kid way worse than Dahmer, bin Laden, or Saddam
Persistent, I'm a sadistic killer ready to uni-bomb
Gadjet, if faggots want static, tell they asses to bring it on

[Chorus: Deuce]
Love me or hate me, but I ain't stopping till I'm on top
I'm screaming "fuck the world" like 2Pac
Say my name, and you might get shot
It's Nine Lives, motherfucker, till I drop
When the guns go off, they pop
We leave your body outlined in chalk
If you talk, you better learn to walk the walk
'Cause it's Nine Lives, motherfucker, till I drop

[Verse 3: Deuce]
I spew hate in every direction I spit, I'm tearing it down, everything you built
I already found my niche, snitches, ain't never gonna stop me, this is it
I can hear my voice, bitch, everyone knows I'm on fire, shit
It's the reason why these white kids buy this
There's no more Undead, it's Nine Lives, this punk-ass better go home or retire
With his mama 'cause it's already too late to stop what I did
It hurts when I rip this mic up, slap you upside and call you my bitch
If you can't play the game, fucker, better stand outside it
You ain't never gonna have no fame again, both you and your boyfriend in bed
Look at these faggots, how I beat them with just the touch of a pen
I could've smacked you hard, but I tapped you, bitch, and wrote this song instead
Like I said in Story of a Snitch, we are not best friends
I almost flew over the cuckoo's nest
I had to get shit off my chest
You tried to push my ass off the edge
But I got Nine Lives, homie, I ain't dead

[Chorus: Deuce]
Love me or hate me, but I ain't stopping till I'm on top
I'm screaming "fuck the world" like 2Pac
Say my name, and you might get shot
It's Nine Lives, motherfucker, till I drop
When the guns go off, they pop
We leave your body outlined in chalk
If you talk, you better learn to walk the walk
'Cause it's Nine Lives, motherfucker, till I drop
