[Verse 1: Deuce]
After everything I've been through
You've got the nerve to walk in my shoes
Everything could've been simple
Till you went and talked a shit load
Now I'm the new Justin Bieber
Like what I work for I don't deserve
Think that I would go soft like Weezer?
Not until the sky is filled with Ether
I'm the Grim Reaper, look in your mirror
And let these words bring you a little bit nearer

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce]
I always gotta watch my back 'cause some chump
From way back didn't want my ass blowing up
Yeah, I always gotta hold my sack 'cause some slut
May claim that we're lovers when all we did was fuck

[Chorus: Deuce]
So you wanna be famous?
You wanna be just like me, shameless?
Living in the fast lane but you're nameless
You wanna change the game? You'll never change this
So you wanna be famous?
You wanna be just like me and take this?
Like it's your last day, it's your last wish?
You wanna change the game? You'll never change this

[Verse 2: Deuce]
You think you can be just like me
Strike with lightning then leave so easy?
All these wannabe Slim Shady
Sound-a-likes just drive me crazy
I know you wanna be hated
Before you push up them daisies
You ain't motherfucking mainstream
Ain't never gonna be with no Beyonc√©
You can't see me, mysteriously
Just let yourself follow me now so freely

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce]
I always gotta watch my back 'cause some chump
From way back didn't want my ass blowing up
Yeah, I always gotta hold my sack 'cause some slut
May claim that we're lovers when all we did was fuck

[Chorus: Deuce]
So you wanna be famous?
You wanna be just like me, shameless?
Living in the fast lane but you're nameless
You wanna change the game? You'll never change this
So you wanna be famous?
You wanna be just like me and take this?
Like it's your last day, it's your last wish?
You wanna change the game? You'll never change this

[Verse 3: Gadjet]
No one in the game is
On my level, can't get up to where I take this
I am the devil and no one can fucking tame this
Go grab a shovel, I'mma dig your fucking grave, pricks
Then I'mma take a shit on your fucking faces
Before I bury you, I'm going through some changes
I know it's scaring you to feel the pain and anguish
It isn't fair to you, Gadjet is the greatest, he don't compare to you
All haters on hiatus, they gon' have to hate us later
Somewhere in the afterlife 'cause up in this world they can't fade us
Even then they won't be able, fuck a name and fuck a label
Fuck everything, I'm not clinically sane, they've got the papers

[Chorus: Deuce]
So you wanna be famous?
You wanna be just like me, shameless?
Living in the fast lane but you're nameless
You wanna change the game? You'll never change this
So you wanna be famous?
You wanna be just like me and take this?
Like it's your last day, it's your last wish?
You wanna change the game? You'll never change this

[Outro: Deuce]
Miley, your camel toe makes me sick
Adam Levine's got a small-ass dick
And I'm gonna keep on talking shit
Till I'm filthy fucking rich
Gaga, your monsters can suck on this
While Elton John eats a salad, bitch
I'm not gonna get in the music biz
But I'm still gonna profit from it
