[Intro: Jeffree Star]
This is Jeffree fucking Star
And this is a big "fuck you" to all you jealous bitches
That get mad that I'm fucking your boyfriends
And don't get mad that they suck my dick then make-out with you after, hoe

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, your boobies look real nice to me tonight
Let's have a pillow fight, I know you're tight
That's when we turn off the lights
Girl, if you're from Orange County, I'll fuck you right
And I think J-Dog might if I'm nice
That's when we turn off the lights

[Verse 1: J-Dog & Deuce]
Uh, I be the J to the D, girls call from O.C
I'll fuck you in your new Daneli
What a change 'cause I fuck g-g-girls in alleys
Behind the beauty bar, let's see how far we can go on a sexual safari
I got a dick like Kareem Abdul-J-J-Jabbarie
Now let's pray, go all the way
Your boyfriend's gay, got his trunk raised
Ain't I right? Hey, Shady
"Let's have a pillow fight"
I'm a sex robot sent back from the fa-fa-fucking future
"Fuck girls deep, stick it in their pooper"

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, your boobies look real nice to me tonight
Let's have a pillow fight, I know you're tight
That's when we turn off the lights
Girl, if you're from Orange County, I'll fuck you right
And I think J-Dog might if I'm nice
That's when we turn off the lights, Undead

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
I'm like the Brad Pitt of scene movies
Take off that shirt and let me see them B boobies
I like C boobies, D boobies, Z boobies
Sad boobies, bad boobies, clean boobies, mean boobies
I get pissed when the haters try to cock-block
I get drunk and touch Tila in her hot spot
It's Charlie Scene, let me drink from your flask
Put on my mask and fuck you in the ass!
"Hey, Charlie, how many girls you taking home tonight?"
My dick's sinned so much it should be crucified
Like Jesus Christ
"Beep-beep! Hey, you girls need a ride? Get inside!"
I pull out my skin sword on the dance floor
Rub it on your butt cheeks and watch it transform
You better put out, don't make me hate you
Or I'll do the Michael Jackson and I'mma rape you!

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, your boobies look real nice to me tonight
Let's have a pillow fight, I know you're tight
That's when we turn off the lights
Girl, if you're from Orange County, I'll fuck you right
And I think J-Dog might if I'm nice
That's when we turn off the lights
That's when we, that's when we turn off the lights, Undead
That's when we, that's when we turn off the lights
Undead

[Brige: Shady Jeff & Da Kurlzz]
Hey, what is that? Dude, is that a guy or a girl?
Hey, faggot!

[Verse 3: Jeffree Star]
Shut the fuck up, you want me
Bitches get mad that I swallow more cum than they can
Wanna give me a hand? 'Cause I'll deep-throat your dad
Then he'll cum on my face before I go on MySpace
And every guy wants my lipstick smeared on his nut-sack
Let's play Barbie and shove Ken's dick in my ass
Or you can be R. Kelly and pee on me
Just don't get it on my plastic surgery
And then I'll beat you like I did that bitch, Stevie
You think that's funny? Watch me eat ForBiddeN's fat pussy

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, your boobies look real nice to me tonight
Let's have a pillow fight, I know you're tight
That's when we turn off the lights
Girl, if you're from Orange County, I'll fuck you right
And I think J-Dog might if I'm nice
That's when we turn off the lights, Undead

[Outro: Jeffree Star & Deuce]
Fucking cunt
That's when we turn off the lights, undead
Eat me out, bitch
Undead
Lick my pussy
That's when we turn off the lights
Sit on my face, Daddy
Faggot
