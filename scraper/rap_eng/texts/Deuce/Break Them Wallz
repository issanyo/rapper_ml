[Intro: Deuce]
Nine Lives, Jefree Star

[Chorus: Deuce]
I've been stuck inside my head too long
It's time to get out and break them walls
I can almost hear them angels call
If God's on my side, I won't fall

[Verse 1: Jeffree Star]
It's Jeffree, bitch, I'm hiding razor blades in my clit
I used to have a big dick, now I'm tighter than shit
I just sucked your dad off, that's how I paid for these tits
Suffocated him quick so I could play with his kids
Teddy bears and pigtails, Blow Pops and blood trails
The tranny's in your house, chainsaw and pink nails
Hot pants and high heels, the Dahmer shemale
With Deuce and Truth, it's fucking unreal
We keep the body parts for our next meal
Si se√±orita, we gon' rape you in the rear
Now my makeup's getting smeared, ooh, my hands are on the mirror
I fucked the whole Warped Tour, made all them bitches queer

[Chorus: Deuce]
I've been stuck inside my head too long
It's time to get out and break them walls
I can almost hear them angels call
If God's on my side, I won't fall

[Verse 2: Deuce]
It's fucking crazy how easy it is for me to just make all them hits
It don't even take any wit and that's why I'm dangerous
Don't think that we ain't got them guns on our hips
My guns are stronger than his, shit's like a bomb when it hits
I'm the new Obama, it's sick, the way I rhyme every syllable
It's like I'm invincible, my pencil's my witness too
Yeah, I'm the Incredible Deuce, you know it's inevitable
Shit's about to get federal, blow the White House and president up
Bitch, shows how much I give a fuck, you know I got more than enough
Skills, when your daughters are rocking vibrators, cock up
In they vaginas and think that I'm up inside 'em
But really I'm just here writing with Jeffree and Truth beside us
And ninety-nine percent of the time I got my mind set
On them millions and diamonds and with that comes some violence
Ever since me and Jimmy I. met, I've been climbing, buck wiling
That's how you know he signed me

[Chorus: Deuce]
I've been stuck inside my head too long
It's time to get out and break them walls
I can almost hear them angels call
If God's on my side, I won't fall

[Verse 3: The Truth]
It's drummer after drummer, I pop to kill
Motherfuckers know that I keep it real
I'm not a patient, but I'm mad ill
Don't play me, son, you might get killed
Same city, same whip, I'm back in the same bitch
Not Fitty, not Em, we dropping the same hits
Damn kid, you know I'm on it like Hendrix
I damage everybody that's average
They talk about me all the time but I don't really give a fuck
Under pressure all the time, I'm in the hood, pistol tucked
I'm The Truth, I state the facts, fuck a snitch, I murder rats
My state of mind is hustle grind, make some moves and watch me shine
Pistols laying on my lap
Angels got my fucking back
This is hell, bitch, all red like velvet
Nine Lives, kid, let me see you rep this

[Chorus: Deuce]
I've been stuck inside my head too long
It's time to get out and break them walls
I can almost hear them angels call
If God's on my side, I won't fall

[Outro: Deuce & The Truth]
Coming in from outer space
Do you read me? Do you read me?
Deuce here, come in, come in
Mayday, mayday
Deuce, can you hear me?
Man down, man down
