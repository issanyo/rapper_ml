[Intro: Gadjet]
Introducing the heavy weight champions
Better get your gloves on and get the right people in your corner
Cause you gon' need 'em
Hey, let's go

[Hook: Arina Chloe & Gadjet]
I'mma get my grind up, I'mma get it in
I done made my mind up, let this shit begin
If you with me now, we down till the end
Homie, ain't nothing change, we going for the win
Cause this ain't just pretend, no
This ain't just pretend, no, oh
This ain't just pretend, no
This ain't just pretend, no, oh

[Verse 1: Deuce]
This is what I'm all about, killing it just for the crowd
Look at all the fans looking at me, without a doubt it's working out
I know that I'm the worst, I'm far from out of bounds
I got a curse, it's cursing me to eat your whole heart out
Fuck a town, your town, my town, sit your ass back down
Give it up for motherfucking Aron
There ain't no one as great, son
Make no mistake, I'm the heavy weight champion
You're the Hansons who grew up in a ranch bitch
And since you became a bunch of diaper eating, potty mouth kids
You've been shitting in your pampers, now it's just me thinking out loud, shit

[Hook: Arina Chloe & Gadjet]

[Verse 2: Deuce]
Bend over, you's a big boy now
Open your ass wide as fuck
Let's play a little Red Rover
Mr. Casanova, uglier than Yoda
Yodels like Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street, hold up
I gotta look over my shoulder just cause you posted
A couple pics on Instagram with a gun loaded
Blow me, why your cheeks rosy
Don't they get red like that when you start spitting, oy vey
You say you got something to say but it's noisy
The frequency inside of your head, it's got you poisoned
Broiling, I got you cooked, your mind is coiling
Shook 'cause you'll never been joined in
(I'mma get my)

[Hook: Arina Chloe & Gadjet]

[Verse 3: Gadjet]
Hello everybody, how the fuck you doin'
Let me take a second on this microphone to ruin
Anybody's fucking chances of rapping a flow this fluent
I'm not a fucking human, you stupid pukes, I'm a mutant
Oh, that's your favorite rapper? That's cool cause I never knew him
But since you introduced him, I might as well show deuce to him
Oh no, not the homie, I'm talking what I'mma do to him
Stand over that phony little pussy and start poopin'

[Hook: Gadjet]

[Outro: Deuce & Gadjet]
Hold up
A round of applause to the Gladiators
Right, exactly, haha
Gladiators right now
Gladiators, dawg
Motherfuckers, heard that
It's the motherfucking Gladiators, dawg
That's what we're in here for
Yes, you know what I'm saying
Y'all want war
Yeah, come and get it
