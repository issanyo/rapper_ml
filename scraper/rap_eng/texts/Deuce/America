[Chorus]
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a fucking AK, it's going up in flames
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

[Verse 1]
You can't tell me what to say 'cause I've got one religion
And I've got one decision, it's a big "fuck you"
I keep spitting in your face, every month and every day
Every time you hear my name, my middle finger's up too
You think I owe you, but I ain't got no room for these hoes
'Cause they're no good, I ain't living by your rules
You're getting old, dude, full of liquor, you're bloated
And you wanna be noticed, but you're dying so slowly

[Pre-Chorus]
So when they point the finger, you flip one back and say
"Fuck that, fuck that"
So when they point their finger, we'll flip ours back and say
"Fuck that, fuck that"

[Chorus]
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a fucking AK, it's going up in flames
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

[Verse 2]
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe, each one of you's gonna know
That your time is coming soon 'cause there ain't enough room
In this world for us too, yeah, I hate to break the news
But I'mma break it in this music and let the world know who
Who you've been using, who you're abusing, it's this youth that you're fooling
But you know that you're useless, always acting so ruthless
Deep inside you're just ruined 'cause I keep on moving, here to show you the truth, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
So when they point the finger, you flip one back and say
"Fuck that, fuck that"
So when they point their finger, we'll flip ours back and say
"Fuck that, fuck that"

[Chorus]
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a fucking AK, it's going up in flames
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

[Bridge]
Why can't you die?
Motherfucker, just die
No more goodbyes
Just fucking die

[Chorus]
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

[Outro]
So when they point the finger, you flip one back and say
"Fuck that, fuck that"
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a fucking AK, it's going up in flames
So when they point their finger, we'll flip ours back and say
"Fuck that, fuck that"
