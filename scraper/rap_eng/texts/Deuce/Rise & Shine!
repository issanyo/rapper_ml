Rain Rain won't go away
Cloud on my head every single day
This pain pain goes right inside
Breaking me down till' I just cry

Little Bully wants to play
Hits me every single day
Pain, pain go right inside
Guess I'll just have to let it slide

Drain drain all my life
Why can't I just stop this strife
Rain rain, won't go away
Cloud on my head every single day

Beat on another kid
But not on me
Rain rain won't go away
Cloud on my head every single day

These games games that you play
Eventually I'll get up and say
No, no not this time
I'm taking back what is mine

(The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.:)
"With this faith
We will be able to transform the jangling discords
Of our nation into a beautiful symphony
Of brotherhood
With this faith
We will be able to work together
To pray together
To struggle together
To go to jail together
To stand up for freedom together
Knowing that we will be able
To sing with new meaning."

Stand up
And take what's mine
Insecurities
Is what you're trying to hide
I don't care
For the things that you say
I know that you're just one step away
From breaking down
Pick yourself up off the ground
I know that you are better than this

Open your eyes
Now is the time
To rise up
With darkness we'll still shine
Idolized and Despised
Wrong or right
We'll make it through to the other side
