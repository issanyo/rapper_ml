[Intro]
Yeah
We will never back down!

[Chorus]
We will never back down!
Why you taking my life?
Bitch, give me the right
We can end it tonight
Never back down!
So go sharpen your knives
We're coming tonight
Got you right in our sight
Right now!
This is a war, this is a war!
I ain't leaving this bitch without blood on the floor!
This is a war, this is a war!
I ain't leaving this bitch without blood on the floor!

[Verse 1:]
I ain't never fell down, every move I make is critical
Label me a criminal, killing every syllable
An individual ripping every verse
Disperses from the heart, the darkness as it tears it apart
Razors sharpened scene, make you bleed from the inside
Time rewinds from the base shaking your spine
Spare stepping your mine in two pieces like a genius
I'm the beat transformed to make a portal in the voice of a monster
American harbor, vocabulary from Harvard, this verse is a slaughter
Grim reaper, mic gripper, goose sipper
None sicker, ask the listener, I'm a ripper
Oh, yeah, BC13 is back here with the raps attacking, the speakers collapsing
Hard rock is what you want from me? Then here's the verse of your dreams
Don't fall for anything if you straight

[Chorus]
Never back down!
Why you taking my life?
Bitch, give me the right
We can end it tonight
Never back down!
So go sharpen your knives
We're coming tonight
Got you right in our sight
Right now!
This is a war, this is a war!
I ain't leaving this bitch without blood on the floor!
This is a war, this is a war!
I ain't leaving this bitch without blood on the floor!

[Verse 2]
Lights out, bitch, watch the cash flow
Money green, like the kush that my fans smoke
And I don't give a shit, yeah, I'm an asshole
Money green, like the kush that my fans blow
Up, up and away we go, pass the buzz like do-si-do
Rip the bottle, let's get some more, I only sip them if they go
Chilling with some hoes in case you wanna know
Through sleet and snow, homie, I'ma get some dough
Hopping out the Porsche, make your panties drop
Balling like a pro, are you ready? Took the granny shots, what?
Record round representing
We can get it popping like some motherfucking candy rocks, what?
I'ma hit the candy shops, skip into the beat
Girl, you better check the end shock, what?
I got these haters trying tell the cops that we in the building
Yeah, we 'bout to make a killing

[Chorus]
Never back down!
Why you taking my life?
Bitch, give me the right
We can end it tonight
Never back down!
So go sharpen your knives
We're coming tonight
Got you right in our sight
Right now!
This is a war, this is a war!
I ain't leaving this bitch without blood on the floor!
This is a war, this is a war!
I ain't leaving this bitch without blood on the floor!

[Verse: Deuce]
Now, who the fuck want to fuck with us? Couple whites all high
I got your girl in the back of the bus, now is everybody still up?
Slut, can you hear or what? Just got some new photos of you
Fuck no, I ain't giving a fuck, my Facebook full, get down and suck
But enough of the nonsense, open your mouth, let me see them tonsils
All these strippers want my shit, they say yours is garbage
Ask Jessi Lee, she'll say, "Oh, yeah, Deuce on top, bitch"
I ain't gonna squash the beat, bitch, I'm just getting started

[Bridge: Deuce]
Lets go party, hit the Bacardi
Get fucked up, the fun is starting
Lets get naughty, undress that body
We came to rock these hotties, cum all over everybody
La-di-da-di, we likes to party
We into causing trouble and don't listen to nobody
So watch what your call me, 'cause Deuce got an army
Remember, I ain't never saying sorry

[Chorus]
We will never back down!
Why you taking my life?
Bitch, give me the right
We can end it tonight
Never back down!
So go sharpen your knives
We're coming tonight
Got you right in our sight
Right now!
This is a war, this is a war!
I ain't leaving this bitch without blood on the floor!
This is a war, this is a war!
I ain't leaving this bitch without blood on the floor!
