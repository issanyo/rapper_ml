[Chorus]
Bitch, this is it
I'm killing it
The fuse is lit
So fucking sick
I'm gonna flip
Fuck all this shit
Better admit
It's over, bitch
That’s fucking it

[Verse 1]
Fuse is lit, like a lunatic
I'm about to blow, almost losing it
Confused again, that's why I keep on shooting them
In the back while they turned around, I'm abusing them
More suicidal than Whitney Houston
I'm getting through this
Can you feel the heat? It's getting humid
Not human, bitch, I'mma do this
Don't you ever tell me that I'm bullshit
Ever since I hit the mic I blew, bitch
Who knew this? I'mma use it
Yeah, fuck the new movement, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Time keeps on ticking, keeps slipping away
I can't wait for it all to go away
It keeps on going, so goddamn insane
Can't wait for the day that it goes, shit

[Chorus]
Bitch, this is it
I'm killing it
The fuse is lit
So fucking sick
I'm gonna flip
Fuck all this shit
Better admit
It's over, bitch
That's fucking it
I'm killing it
Fuck all this shit
'Cause it's over, bitch
So fucking sick

[Verse 2]
So sick, yeah, I'm sick, bitch, with the sickness
Ain't gon' diss this, I'mma miss this
I'mma spit shit
Even if you think that I'm a chicken
I'mma explode on all you bitches
You think I let go but I ain't finished
Even if I end it with a slit wrist
I'm a minute away splitting
Like a nuke, that's what I'm wishing
Wish that I was fisting fat bitches
Shit's ridiculous, shit, I'm inches
Away from jumping off the highest building

[Pre-Chorus]
Bitches, time keeps on ticking, keeps slipping away
I can't wait for it all to go away
It keeps on going, so goddamn insane
Can't wait for the day that it goes, shit

[Chorus]
Bitch, this is it
I'm killing it
The fuse is lit
So fucking sick
I'm gonna flip
Fuck all this shit
Better admit
It's over, bitch
That’s fucking it

[Brige]
Fucked in the head, can't feel my legs
Toss me the meds, fuck, am I dead?
Must be the end, where to begin? Tell me again
Fuck all these demons, lost in these feelings
Waiting to see him for all my sins

[Chorus]
Bitch, this is it
I'm killing it
The fuse is lit
So fucking sick
I'm gonna flip
Fuck all this shit
Better admit
It's over, bitch
That's fucking it
I'm killing it
Fuck all this shit
'Cause it's over, bitch
So fucking sick
