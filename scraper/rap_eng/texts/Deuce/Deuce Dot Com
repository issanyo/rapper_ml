[Intro]
Oh, don't stop
What's my name, girl? What's my name, girl?
Don't stop, shake that thing, girl, shake that thing

[Chorus]
We can ride if you wanna ride later
We can dance if you wanna dance, baby
I don't care if you got a man, save it
Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine

[Verse 1]
Yeah, California, throw 'em up, where you at?
California, get ready, I'm back
I keep it bumping like I'm black
Like Michael Myers switched out the masks
I know you like what you see
But listening to 50 taught me all I need
You can visit me on the web
HTTP, got your bitch on her knees
Dotcom, I'm the bomb
If you're friends with Tom, MySpace.com
I'll give you what you need
Keep you dancing all night like ecstasy
Everybody's doing it, baby
Everybody, everybody get crazy
We can dance, or we can ride
Shake that ass, I got LA pride

[Chorus]
We can ride if you wanna ride later
We can dance if you wanna dance, baby
I don't care if you got a man, save it
Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine
We can ride if you wanna ride later
We can dance if you wanna dance, baby
I don't care if you got a man, save it
Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine

[Verse 2]
They want to get to know me
They all want to be my homies
I ain't no Timberlake
But I got more bitches at the end of the day
I'm shining, shining, and everybody knows me
I'm grinding, I'm grinding, they're saying: "Oh Lordy"
There he goes again, oh yeah
Getting crunked again, and you mad
You like my tats, my shoes, my hats
I'm back, I'm dressed in black
Your crew keeps wondering where I'm at
They keep thinking how I got so bad
I'm slipping through the back door, motherfucker
We can ride, we can dance if you wanna
Or we can take it to the back
Watch some little ladies shake that ass, we can all get trashed

[Chorus]
We can ride if you wanna ride later
We can dance if you wanna dance, baby
I don't care if you got a man, save it
Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine
We can ride if you wanna ride later
We can dance if you wanna dance, baby
I don't care if you got a man, save it
Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine

[Verse 3]
I don't stop for hoes, I don't stop for yo's
Hollywood's got me crazed, that's for sure
They don't like it when they see me with a 4-0
And getting tickets every night by the po-po
My rep goes back, it goes so far
I ain't got no cash, but you think I'm a star
Pulling up in the fancy car, I be getting all the fancy broads
I did it all for the nookie, the nookie
I'm rolling, I'm rolling, come on, Cookie
Don't think I'm here to get yours
I'm bad, I'm back, I'm here to get more
So keep grinding, bumping, dancing
Move how you wanna move
We can do it all night if you wanna groove
'Cause there ain't nothing left to do except me and you, bitch

[Chorus]
We can ride if you wanna ride later
We can dance if you wanna dance, baby
I don't care if you got a man, save me
Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine
We can ride if you wanna ride later
We can dance if you wanna dance, baby
I don't care if you got a man, save it
Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine
