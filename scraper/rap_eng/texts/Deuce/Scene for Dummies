[Intro: Da Kurlzz]
What? Yo, this is Da Kurlzz, bitch
We ain't just a gang motherfucker, but a way of life
Yo, check it, this is my boy, Tha Produca

[Chorus: Deuce]
All you, fans on Sunset, show me where the fuck you at
Scene kids, ghetto stars, come on, grab your gats
All the world and Hollywood drinking 40's in the hood
Tila, Tila, shake that ass like you know you should
All you, fans on Sunset, show me where the fuck you at
Chad Crews getting bruised, now it's time to move
All the world and Hollywood drinking 40's in the hood
Tila, Tila, shake that ass like you know you should

[Verse 1: Funny Man]
Hollywood Undead, get it through your head
Download this song, put it in your iPod
Fuck that, put it on your homepage
You'll be the coolest kid on fucking MySpace
I'm at the scene club, told Jeffree Star to beat it
'Cause I left her a comment and saw that bitch delete it
And that's fucked up 'cause I sent it from my Sidekick
You got beef, meet me on Franklin and Highland

[Chorus: Deuce]
All you, fans on Sunset, show me where the fuck you at
Scene kids, ghetto stars, come on, grab your gats
All the world and Hollywood drinking 40's in the hood
Tila, Tila, shake that ass like you know you should
All you, fans on Sunset, show me where the fuck you at
Chad Crews getting bruised, now it's time to move
All the world and Hollywood drinking 40's in the hood
Tila, Tila, shake that ass like you know you should

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene, Da Kurlzz & Johnny 3 Tears]
It's Charlie Scene, he ain't ever looking cheesy
It's Charlie Scene, it ain't easy being scene-y
If I was you, I'd hate me too
We could take it to the parking lot like '82 and bring your crew
And I'd hate to be the one to break the news
Whoever chipped Mattie's tooth, I'll shank you too, bitch
That night at '82, the parking lot was stacked
I grabbed my gat and got my hand stamped by Matt
I could barely walk around 'cause the dance floor was so packed
I walked to the back and lit off some black hats
"Bap! Bap! Bap!"
Scene kids tired of being picked on by mean kids
And I'd hate to be obscene kid
But have you seen my penis?
I have
I know you have â€˜cause that shit is bomb
My dick's got more friends than Tom
These scene clubs, I run these
I should write the book "How to Be Scene for Dummies"

[Chorus: Deuce]
All you, fans on Sunset, show me where the fuck you at
Scene kids, ghetto stars, come on, grab your gats
All the world and Hollywood drinking 40's in the hood
Tila, Tila, shake that ass like you know you should
All you, fans on Sunset, show me where the fuck you at
Chad Crews getting bruised, now it's time to move
All the world and Hollywood drinking 40's in the hood
Tila, Tila, shake that ass like you know you should

[Bridge: Deuce]
Aw shit, fucking shit was brutal
I just broke that fucking bitch off

[Verse 3: Shady Jeff]
Yo, Shady Jeff at the mic
Wanna shout out to my boys in FFTL on tour
Roommate: Chad Crews, no more pills, fool
Dave and Bridge; Pirate, dawg; Ev Sesh, your mom misses you
Wrecking Crew girls; The Frauds; Rosie, where the fuck the treats at?
Apartment 20, Franklin and Highland, Avenue 43, Nela, fool
South Pass, Eagle Rock, North Hollywood
Tio, kid; Compton, fool, Inglewood
818, 213, 310, 323
LA, bitch

[Chorus: Deuce]
All you, fans on Sunset, show me where the fuck you at
Scene kids, ghetto stars, come on, grab your gats
All the world and Hollywood drinking 40's in the hood
Tila, Tila, shake that ass like you know you should
All you, fans on Sunset, show me where the fuck you at
Chad Crews getting bruised, now it's time to move
All the world and Hollywood drinking 40's in the hood
Tila, Tila, shake that ass like you know you should

[Outro: Shady Jeff]
"I cummed in her mouth"
