[Verse 1: Matt Brandyberry]
You never thought I'd follow through so here's a song for all of you
Reaction for attacking me and acting like I'm small to you
This is what you call the truth, it chews you up and swallows you
A fraction of the wrath of me unraveling for all to view
I'm glad you always hated me 'cause that's what made me chase the dream
And now I'm here, so close, so near and you're so far away to me
This is what you made me be, you'll always be the same to me
So full of fear, afraid to hear me spit the truth so blatantly

[Chorus: Chris Musser]
You brought me down for the last time
It's the last time I shut my mouth
I'm screaming out from the inside
For the first time, it's the last time
You bring me down

[Verse 2: Matt Brandyberry]
It's funny that you think we're friends, it's maybe time to think again
The shit you said, you wished me dead instead of trying to make amends
Now it's finally sinking in that I'm the one who's finishing
So don't pretend to take offense, you earned it, every single cent
Almost thought that you were right, I always thought I'd lose the fight
And came undone, you always won, you almost conquered me with spite
You never saw it through the light, it blinded you, it skewed your sight
The shit you talked and what you thought and now it fucking ends tonight

[Chorus: Chris Musser]
You brought me down for the last time
It's the last time I shut my mouth
I'm screaming out from the inside
For the first time, it's the last time
You bring me down

[Verse 3: Deuce]
Quiet as a mouse, was always shutting my mouth
Quiet in the beginning till I figured it out
Look at me now, straight spitting without
All these fake ass motherfuckers holding me down
You thought I had a nervous breakdown and was playing around
Your whole shit went underground soon as I popped the fuck out
Soon as I stepped on the scene and started knocking 'em out
Stomping 'em out just for trying to block my ass out
What the fuck you talking about rocking a crowd?
This is rock, not pop, look who's popular now
Bitch please, stop talking me down
The only thing that you were ever good at was mocking me
How I couldn't see how you were stopping me

[Chorus: Chris Musser]
You brought me down for the last time
It's the last time I shut my mouth
I'm screaming out from the inside
For the first time, it's the last time
You bring me down

[Outro: Branden Kreider & Chris Musser]
You brought me down for the last time
It's the last time you bring me down
I'm screaming out from the inside
It's the last time you bring me down
