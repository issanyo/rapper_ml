[Intro: The Truth]
Hollyhood in the house
Los Angeles, stand up

[Verse 1: The Truth]
I was having dreams, laid out on the futon
Knocks on my mama's crib, they came through, suit on
I couldn't save my life even if I had a coupon
Four years later, now I'm back with my jewels on
Yeah, I'm Mr. Hollyhood, ain't talking lights-camera
Money grow on fucking trees, yeah, I'm talking marijuana
I'm tucking pistol hammer, ain't tucking true December
I ain't talking baking soda, but I got that Arm and Hammer
Yeah, she got a head game, she be playing head games
Fucking with that real pimp, dunking on you hater lames
Sipping on the Haterade, get yourself a Minute Maid
Making moves, getting praised, switching lanes, interstate
Laker game, Staples Center, sitting next to O Jack
Nothing but the fucking truth, putting on a coldact
Riding through the boulevard, all clear, no tip
And I got my stripes on like J on his girlfriend

[Chorus: Deuce]
Here in LA, here in LA
All of our dreams come true, there's a reason
But we're here in LA, we're here in LA
So if you see me, don't be scared to greet me
Up here in LA, in LA

[Verse 2: The Truth]
Hi, I'm The Truth, rapper slash hustler
See the Benz parked, blame it on the customer
Ain't talking safe sex, homie, but I stay strapped
Yes, I'm the prize, but I don't come with gift wrap
I still come from Hollyhood, from my Mexicanos
Right there by the fence, right around McDonald's
Keys ain't a problem, I'll push it like Alicia
Break it all down then charge it like a Visa
Walking through Griffith Park, sipping on the Kool-Aid
Yeah, I got a PS3, you could blame the Blu-Ray
Yeah, I love the Dodgers, love them like the Vatos
Not a fan of Roscoe's, I don't really fuck with waffles
At least once a week I gotta have my tacos
First wrap I ever got, I snatched it up from Carlos'
20/20 vision, yeah, it's hard to be me
'Cause all that's on my face, you don't see what I see

[Chorus: Deuce]
Here in LA, here in LA
All of our dreams come true, there's a reason
But we're here in LA, we're here in LA
So if you see me, don't be scared to greet me
Up here in LA, in LA

[Verse 3: Deuce & The Truth]
It's the City of Dreams, where people come, and people go
It's the City of Fiends, with people running for that blow
This city just needs a little love, a little hope
And I ain't talking snorting a little bit of coke
Or toking on that dope, running from the po-po
Oh no, been there and done that, so yo
Here's a story that I'd like you to know
About my life and those I once rolled with
We used to go sip Alize with no mix
Drink, catch a couple girls with some lip rings
And then joke about how we hit these
And laugh and talk about how her shit stinks
Or how she ripped three queefs
And when I bent her over, she would scream
"Now that's a big thing"
Deuce: Oh shit, it's a he, it's a she
Here in LA, it's all the same to me

[Chorus: Deuce]
Here in LA, here in LA
All of our dreams come true, there's a reason
But we're here in LA, we're here in LA
So if you see me, don't be scared to greet me
Up here in LA, in LA

[Bridge: Deuce & The Truth]
Goddamn, it feels good to be back
You've been so good to us
Here in LA, here in LA
Palm trees, fast cars, gangstas and hustlers
Only place that you can find us at is...

[Chorus: Deuce]
Here in LA, here in LA
All of our dreams come true, there's a reason
But we're here in LA, we're here in LA
So if you see me, don't be scared to greet me
Up here in LA, in LA
