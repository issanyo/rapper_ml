[Intro: Truth & Deuce]
Hey yo, Deuce
You hear about this fuck boy Danny
Fuckin' American Idol reject...
Fuckin' Faggots!

That's when we, that's when we, that's when we ride!
That's when we, that's when we ride on these bitches!
(X2)

[Hook: Deuce]
That's when we ride on bitches, you fuckin' faggot snitches
So don't you try, we packin' 9's, we leave you dead in ditches
(X2)

[Verse 1: Kinda Major]
Yo, Hollywood Who? Without my dawg Deuce
Don't make me have to rhyme, Man the boy got juice
In or outside, this ain't only in the booth
Somebody gonna die, they gonna wish they called truce
Kinda Major on a track got Truth, Gadjet get the facts
If you faggots wants proof, might as well hang it up now
No noose
I'm fuckin' everybody, leave your pussies out loose
Tie em' up and I throw em' in the trunk
Fuckers want a war
And I'mma give em' what they want
Bend they ass over
I'mma treat them like a punk
Prison break that ass off
Going til I bust a nut
I don't give a fuck, never have never will
Go try find a better rapper with some better skill
I murder mother fuckers, I massacre for the thrill
Itching for some fucking killing and blood is my Benadryl

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Deuce]
Look now, you got to admit
No one likes your pussy music
You say you sold out, but didn't sell shit
Fucking idiots, lip sync fags milli vanili bitch
How the fuck do you call yourselves a band?
You can barely rap it's on now
What comes up must come must come down
When this shit flies, I won't be around
Saying I can't spit was your biggest mistake
Now UNDEAD sucks, they're a bunch of fakes
Johnnys' getting overweight he's too fat to be callin' names
Let's play a game
Everyone's listening
When I say fuck, sing along and say "Fuck HU"
Fuck HU!
When I say "What's my name?"
You call me Big Deuce
What's my name?
BIG DEUCE!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Truth]
It's what it is, I'm the best in the Biz
Black ski masks and the sig, 2 clips
2 sips off of that Rosay
With my man Jose with the coke
Wait
OC, and the bumb of the cree cree
HU be softer then the sea breeze
Fuck You
We be nuttier than a resees
And we see more dough
Move more blow
Deuce go solo, drop yall homos
So fly come out the parachute
I'm always first to bail
Never scared to shoot
The Truth, ya know I'm out for the loot
Heading to the top
We movin' through the roof
Shorty got her top down
Just like the coupe
Fuck you, this is 9Lives
Real like, my ties
One slip and you all die

Chorus:
That's when we ride on bitches, you fuckin' faggot snitches
So don't you try, we packin' 9's, we leave you dead in ditches

[Bridge: Deuce]
What!
Say what the fuck!
Six shooters up!
Now, what the fuck!
Point them up!

[Verse 4: GML]
I'mma snatch your mask off
And tell it like it is
No more talent, no more show biz
Deuce left the band
Now yall a bunch of jokes
Hollywood is Dead
And that's all she fucking wrote
Leave you dead in the ditches
Heard you were snitches
9Lives that's how
We ride on you bitches, yeah
I said it, it's the boy from GML
If you got hurt feeling, oh well
Do something you couldn't
Face me on your best day
The Wiz Kid is gone
That's why you get less pay
Still remember when your
First album dropped
Skipped it to the chorus
The rest of yall flopped
Wack ass lyrics
I mean garbage
Leaky like a faucet
Your whole entourage
Wish on a star bitch
You'll never make a million
Ninelives and GML
In the buildin'

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Vegas]
Bitch you piss me off when you faggots go and cockblock
Dippin in the coupe with the bitties in the droptop
Rippin on these tracks, fuck I keep it goin non stop
I'm on top
It's hard to reduce the use of paper
When all we do is deduce the haters
Here with Deuce, fuckin Truth and Major
I'm not angry dude it's my new behavior
So fuck $T$ Master he's such a bastard
I'll cut his ass (word)
He's too busy tryna act like a latin king
To understand fully what the fuck is happening
Ninelives takin over
Blind eyes see your sober
My ties like a dozer
Fly high super nova
But, lately they hate me greatly but it ain't be enough to phase me
Yellow caution tape see
I keep it on safety
