[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
I loved you, you made me
Hate me, you gave me
Hate, see it saved me
And these tears are deadly
You feel that, I rip back
Every time you tried to steal that
You feel bad, you feel sad?
I'm sorry hell no fuck that
It was my heart it was my life
It was my start it was your knife
This strife, it dies
This life and these lies
And these lungs have sung
This song for too long
And it's true, I hurt to
Remember I loved you

[Chorus: Deuce & Rama Duke]
And I've lost it all
Fell today
It's all the same
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no, no!
And I've been abused
I feel so used
Because of you
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no!

[Verse 2: J-Dog]
I wish I could have quit you
I wish I never missed you
And told you that I loved you
Every time I fucked you
The future that we both drew
And all the shit we've been through
Obsessed with the thought of you
The pain just grew and grew
How could you do this to me?
Look at what I made for you
It never was enough
And the world is what I gave to you
I used to be love-struck
Now I'm just fucked up
Pull up my sleeve
And see the pattern of my cuts!

[Chorus: Deuce & Rama Duke]
And I've lost it all
Fell today
It's all the same
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no, no!
And I've been abused
I feel so used
Because of you
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no!

[Brige: Rama Duke & Deuce]
Seems like all we had is over now
And left to rest
And my tears are dried up now
I just lay without a sound
Seems like all we had is over now
And left to rest
And your tears are dried up now
I can leave with my head down

[Chorus: Deuce & Rama Duke]
And I've lost it all
Fell today
It's all the same
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no, no!
And I've been abused
I feel so used
Because of you
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no!

[Outro: Deuce]
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, no!
