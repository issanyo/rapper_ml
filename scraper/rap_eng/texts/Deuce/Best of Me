[Verse 1]
Time keeps killing me, it's my worst enemy
I got the remedy, a motherfucking real emcee
Ain't ten of me, I'mma let 'em see
How insane I am mentally
Fuck everything, down on your knees
Bitch please, ain't gonna get the best of me
I'mma make 'em bleed, long as I'mma breathe
Got everything I need, never gonna leave

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how long it takes, we'll make it
We've been through so many different changes
Now we're strong enough that we can face it
There's nothing out there that's gonna change it

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing gonna last forever
I did it all to just make it better
You know that we're in this together
These days I'll try to always remember

[Verse 2]
This is the end, where we began
Before healing, ain't no leaving
Ain't no reason, no more grieving
We win again
Never in vain, spirit remains
Don't need no brains, picture or frame
Live for today, fuck what you say
Only one way, that's my way

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how long it takes, we'll make it
We've been through so many different changes
Now we're strong enough that we can face it
There's nothing out there that's gonna change it

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing gonna last forever
I did it all to just make it better
You know that we're in this together
These days I'll try to always remember

[Bridge]
That sticks and stones may hurt but not as strong as words
Forgive us for what we've done before we burn
The tables always turn, we run when we are hurt
Can't keep going like this, not what I deserve

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing gonna last forever
I did it all to just make it better
You know that we're in this together
These days I'll try to always remember
