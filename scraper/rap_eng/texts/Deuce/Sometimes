[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I wanted this to end
Somehow I feel like there's nothing left
Sometimes I feel like the world was falling down
Somehow I feel like I was wrong

[Chorus]
Don't go!
Don't stay!
Don't fight the feelings
That you've felt so long before
Don't tell me everything's alright
Don't go!
Don't stay!
Don't find the reason
Why we've fallen down today
Don't tell me everything's alright
Don't go!

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like I've fallen in this mess
Somehow I still feel so upset
Sometimes I feel like the world was going to end
Somehow I feel like I was wrong

[Chorus]
Don't go!
Don't stay!
Don't fight the feelings
That you've felt so long before
Don't tell me everything's alright
Don't go!
Don't stay!
Don't find the reason
Why we've fallen down today
Don't tell me everything's alright
Don't go!

[Brige]
Will you stay
With this life I've betrayed?
Will you pray with me?
I'm falling apart
Will you stay
With this life I've betrayed?
Will you pray
This time I'm falling apart?

[Chorus]
Don't go!
Don't stay!
Don't fight the feelings
That you've felt so long before
Don't tell me everything's alright
Don't go!
Don't stay!
Don't find the reason
Why we've fallen down today
Don't tell me everything's alright
Don't go!

[Outro]
Don't tell me...
Feel like I wanted this to end
Don't tell me...
Feel like I wanted this to end
