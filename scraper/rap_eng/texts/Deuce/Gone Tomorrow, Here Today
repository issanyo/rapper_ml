[Verse 1]
Another legendary verse
Boom, ask questions later, shoot first
Let me go, I don't know what's worse
Leaving in a body bag or leaving in a hearse
But maybe that depends
So I'm not afraid to die, that's why I'm burning at both ends
Fuck fake-ass friends
My story's just beginning, this is where yours ends!

[Pre-Chorus]
It's my life to live, my choice to give
My blood, my sweat, my tears to it
I won't stop till I get what I want
And I want everything, that's a whole fucking lot!
It's the American Dream, and I'm chasing it!

[Chorus]
Gone tomorrow, here today
I won't swallow the pain away
Don't pray for my sins, I still got hell to pay
It's too late
Gone tomorrow, here today
I'll never listen to what you say
Don't pray for my sins, I got no soul to take
Gone tomorrow, here today
Gone tomorrow, here today

[Verse 2]
Bitch, you'll never be rich, don't ever say it
Take your bullshit, find another place to play it
I'll be shining bright long after you're faded
You're PG, I'm motherfucking X-rated
And my wick is lit, I'm spitting sick as shit
I won't stop to regret the things I did
You can love it or hate it, you'll never recreate it
It's too bad, so sad, you almost made it

[Pre-Chorus]
It's my life to live, my choice to give
My blood, my sweat, my tears to it
I won't stop till I get what I want
And I want everything, that's a whole fucking lot!
It's the American Dream, and I'm chasing it!

[Chorus]
Gone tomorrow, here today
I won't swallow the pain away
Don't pray for my sins, I still got hell to pay
It's too late
Gone tomorrow, here today
I'll never listen to what you say
Don't pray for my sins, I got no soul to take
Gone tomorrow, here today

[Chorus]
Gone tomorrow, here today
I won't swallow the pain away
Don't pray for my sins, I still got hell to pay
It's too late
Gone tomorrow, here today
I won't swallow the pain away
Don't pray for my sins, I still got hell to pay
It's too late
Gone tomorrow, here today
I'll never listen to what you say
Don't pray for my sins, I got no soul to take
Gone tomorrow, here today
Gone tomorrow, here today
Gone tomorrow, here today
Gone tomorrow, here today
