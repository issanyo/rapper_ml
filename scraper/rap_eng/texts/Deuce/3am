[Intro: DEADBOYYDRE]
Niggas known locally
Trippin' off local scenes
I've got niggas overseas thats been holding me down
Man I'm the talk of the town
Call me young Pac cause I'm getting around

[Verse 1: DEADBOYYDRE]
Your goal is running the block
My goal is running the world
Before I lay my head to rest
Make sure La Menace is blessed
So much shit up on my chest
Guess I'm too focused on being the best
Pray that I'm next up
Pray that I get all my cheques up
So that my momma could flex up
Yeah aye
Back to the east
Where these fuck niggas all wanna be me
Talk on my name and they callin' me lame
When they see me on roads they say nothing proceed
Pourin' up, throwin' up whole squad on the block going up
Bridges burn, niggas turn
Got me hurt but at the end a nigga learned
I am a lone wolf, don't need your help
Gold 'round my neck lookin' like Michael Phelps
And I'm runnin' the north but got love in the south
It's crazy how niggas be runnin' they mouth
Act like we friends puttin' shit in my head
The same niggas frontin' be wanting me dead
Fuck with a Menace my niggas relentless we'll strip you down and fill ya head up with lead
Yeah aye
No holdin' me
Never met a nigga thinkin' he's as cold as me
Most these rap ass niggas out here mouldy G
Graduated from the game got a couple degrees
Got a bitch double D's guess she dumber than me
I don't fuck with many niggas just La Menace and me
Please just stop with the actin' let's see your reaction when I'm at the top living comfortably

[Hook: Deuce]
3am so much is on my mind
I swear that I'm gonna run out of time
3am I only wanna grind
Them niggas just hate when you tryna shine
3am that's when I'm really workin'
Niggas is mad cause they really hurtin'
3am up but I'm feeling perfect
3am how is this feeling worth it?

[Pre-Verse: DEADBOYYDRE]
Talk of the town
Talk of the town
Came from the dirt like the grass on the ground
Chose the wrong path but I turned it around
Put the street money to studio sounds
Remember when I wasn't shit
These niggas they loved me but now that I'm up they throw fits
Because we ain't on the same level I took off
And now you keep claiming I worship the devil

[Verse 2: DEADBOYYDRE]
I came up like Pauly from Goodfellas
I was raised by the mob
At 15 I wanted the world but seen niggas pushin' the rock
So I said put me on whatchu want me to do?
I wanted the diamonds designer wear too
He pulled me aside, said this life ain't for you
Workin' the block for a hunnid or 2 a week
I see you be rapping you and your peeps
Believe in yourself nigga keep the peace
Stay outta the heat focus on the beats
Don't be a statistic up on the streets
Workin' overtime tryna dodge a fuckin' 9-5
Tryna be the light through the darkness please just give me time
Cut ties, envy me
Gettin' mine by any means
Step aside don't follow me
I had to do it alone you see
Making my way to the industry
Nobody giving a fuck about me
Recorded in the backroom of the tech room
Now I'm making hits feeling like I'm Reggie Jack-soon
Jack-soon, nigga Jackson
Swagger jack-sum
Most these niggas in my ends be my fuckin' grandsons
Man I let em' on the boat and they took from mine to make they own
Throw em' back in the water watch them drown slow
Drown cold yeah I know, I'm a fuckin' asshole
Sit em' on the bench make em' watch from out of bounds though
Niggas with the most talk watching from the ground floor
Saying that they love me but they prayin' for my downfall
I am a lone wolf don't need your help
Fuck all the features do it by myself
And in Menace I trust I don't need no one else
Friendin' cause they seeking for wealth
But where was you at when I was locked away in the basement at 3am stressin' myself
The basement at 3am writtin' these rhymes
Basement at 3am losing my mind
Basement at 3am get on my grind
I almost gave up had me prayin' to god
Took a lil' break but I'm back with the mob
Puttin' up numbers throwin' alleys to Shaun
Dom PÃ©rignon showers
In the studio the night hours
Work in silence I ain't gotta tell you
Nigga we La Menace you should get familiar

[Hook: Deuce]
3am so much is on my mind
I swear that I'm gonna run out of time
3am I only wanna grind
Them niggas just hate when you tryna shine
3am that's when I'm really workin'
Niggas is mad cause they really hurtin'
3am up but I'm feeling perfect
3am how is this feeling worth it?
