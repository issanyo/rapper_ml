[Intro: Charlie Scene & Funny Man]
It was once a dark, lonely summer's eve on the lonely streets of Sunset
When the Lord called upon six crazy emcees:
J-Dog, Charlie Scene, Johnny 3 Tears, Da Kurlzz, and Tha Produca
Hey, uh!
Man, you forgot the homie, Funny Man, come on, dawg, aw!

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I can show you how to hump without making love
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak
And I'll be laying in the sun, bottle and a gun
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak

[Verse 1: Funny Man]
My clothes are always retro
Sexual like I'm hetero
And I play a bitch like Nintendo
Take her for a ride in my Benzo
Funny as fuck, I should do stand-up
Bust caps at the crowd like I don't give a fuck
Got a gold-ass grill
Hit me on the sidekick if you wanna chill
Hop in the ride, let's roll
I'm a baritone with the voice so low
It'll make your speakers explode
And I'll drop your panties to the floor
Let me bend you over, let me lay you sideways
Hop in the back, girl, it's Freaky Friday
If you got beef, then you better step up, bitch
Hollywood Undead ain't nothing to fuck with!

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I can show you how to hump without making love
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak
And I'll be laying in the sun, bottle and a gun
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene & Funny Man]
Girl, come and smoke my pole like a Marlboro
Introduce me to your mom as Charles
It's Charlie Scene, shake your ass to the bass
Wait till you see my face, hey, bitch
Wear them tight jeans that show your ass-crack
My first name gives Vietnam flashbacks
I get drunk and do the same old, same old
Take three girls home and call them Charlie's Angels
What you gonna do after we get signed?
I'm gonna lose my mind
Get 30-inch spinners and pimp my ride
Go back in time, be there that night and save 2Pac's life
Then pay my fine for getting caught
Fucking on the Hollywood sign, I got the game on lock
I'll have a bottle and a Glock with biceps like the Rock
Buy Tom's soul back from Rupert Murdoch

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I can show you how to hump without making love
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak
And I'll be laying in the sun, bottle and a gun
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak

[Bridge: Deuce & Funny Man]
Get down, I'll show you how
Come on, girl, let me show you how
Let's get freaky-deaky now
Get down, I'll show you how
Come on, girl, let me show you how
Let's get freaky-deaky now

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I can show you how to hump without making love
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak
And I'll be laying in the sun, bottle and a gun
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak

[Outro: Deuce & Funny Man & Charlie Scene & Da Kurlzz]
Get down, I'll show you how
If you got beef, then you better step up, bitch
Hollywood Undead ain't nothing to fuck with
Get down, I'll show you how!
I'll have a bottle and a Glock with biceps like the Rock
Buy Tom's soul back from Rupert Murdoch
Bitch! What, motherfucker?
