[Intro]
There once was a kid named Deuce
Who got sick and tired of being picked on
So he got himself a nice 22
Click boom, now he's on the fuckin news

[Verse 1]
Now who's the king of these rap acts? American Bad ass
They say he's a class act, no wonder he's jabbed at
That's why they put me up in lights and I rap back
And have these critics wanna mimic my crack ass
He ain't no cinic but he knows where your dad's at
They ain't gonna finish til' they send you to Bagdhad
And minute by minute they goin' pull you right in it
You go' end up at clinics because they put you on xanax
But don't you worry I'm back ya Deuce is back with a black hat
Cape and a black cat baby I'm the new Batman
You know only sarah can grab that
I don't need no groupies trying to grab at my pants
Hoping that I'm gonna go back and tax that
I ain't endin' up in no place with no bad rash
How come I get laughed at by media trash bags
Just because I'm white and I sing like I'm half black

[Hook]
Now you see my life and it looks so pretty looks so pretty
You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad
Try and take my pride we both know that's silly, know that's silly
You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad

[Verse 2]
Soon as my voice's touch's or even get's close to a track
It's rat-a-tat-tat-tat I'm droppin' bomb's on they asses
Burn you up in the ashes ya I'm back to my old tactics
Rappin to slay faggots and rappers who ain't have what it take's
So I straight jack 'em, Slap em' I ain't laughin'
This is where it gets tragic homie you ain't matchin' me or my ryhmes
Half black half white rapper tryna' downgrade my skills
Tellin everyone I'm wack, shit what about your habbit?
Slangin' dope on the streets from your one bedroom apartment
"Hey look, it's me Cartman I'm retarted"
Don't get me started how these old farts tryn' pick apart my religion
Of course I'm gifted ain't no god but I'm lifted
Listen I'm the wizkid who grew up a little different
Welcome to my life bitch, It's my last mission

[Hook]
Now you see my life and it looks so pretty looks so pretty
You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad
Try and take my pride we both know that's silly know that's silly
You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad

[Verse 3]
I was born to rip shit, Born with too much wit
That's why they call me the wizkid cause I drop hits
Mimic me? I'm too sick, you can't hang I'm too quick
What's my name? DEUCE BITCh, it's the new shit
Leavin' ego's bruised in ya you're trapped you're stupid
Try and step in my shoes but it's foolish
I'm coo coo homie I got screw's loose
Fuck Tool you can kiss my ass too bitch. You and your affiliates
You're worth two cents of my time and a few bars so move bitch
As long as I'm doing music, I'ma be a nuesence, It's a new movement

[Hook] (x2)
