[Intro: Truth]
Hollyhood in the building
Haha, haha
Aye, yo, Deuce, where the pistols at?

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
You don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause you's a bitch just like the police
And I remember you was begging on your knees
And I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
You don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause you's a bitch just like the police
And I remember you was begging on your knees

[Verse 1: The Truth]
I pray the Lord will tell 'em all to forgive me for my sins
Not a ticket to heaven, just for my unborn kids
I'm addicted to the fast life, money, and drugs
Plus you can't forget the bitches in Cali' showing us love
I smoke weed, pop pills, never catch me shoot up
I'm a product of prison, behind walls is where I grew up
Getting money, fucking bitches, bowing down to no man
Nine Lives newsflash, get with the program
Ain't nobody invincible, anybody can get it
It ain't fuck the world, homie, it's the people that's in it
And if you a rat, homie, I got a pistol for that
All that wolfing in my ear, where the paperwork at?
When you think it's all over, lights out, I'm gone
I got Nine Lives, homie, correct me if I'm wrong
All eyes on me till I return
The truth, nothing else, my word is my bond

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
You don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause you's a bitch just like the police
And I remember you was begging on your knees
And I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
You don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause you's a bitch just like the police
And I remember you was begging on your knees

[Verse 2: Deuce]
Leaders ain't got no fucking mercy for their enemies
Plus I'm living all your fucking dreams and your fantasies
I got some G's that'll wake you up and take a felony
I got some G's that'll break you, I'm becoming Makaveli, whoa
Don't get it twisted, I'm just trying to keep it friendly, yo
Go to church, keep it real, that's my antidote
"But Aron, I just wanna be in Hollywood Undead, though
I think I'm really cool 'cause I can sip on 4-0's
Until my mommy gets real mad at me and sends me home"
I'm everything everyone wanted to be
In Hollywood, everybody keeps on calling for me
It's a disgrace, you ain't even got a bed or TV, ha
I turn bitches into monkeys and apes
Voodoo dolls, brass knuckles, I got magic for days
If I can smell your girl's vagina from a mile away
Then I can give you Brain Damage on any given day

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
You don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause you's a bitch just like the police
And I remember you was begging on your knees
And I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
You don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause you's a bitch just like the police
Deuce: And I remember you was begging on your knees

[Verse 3: Snype]
Now I'm a vet, so you can bet that I'mma do what I gotta do
The thug in me, nigga, got me sporting this powder blue
Bailing through, niggas hate the color, but fuck 'em, dawg
Real keep it real, I don't bang, I set it off
Ain't got hood love, so I grew through this bitch
Like it don't mean shit, still trying to get rich
Ain't got bad habits, so I'm pleasing my addictions
With a chronic and convalesce eight along with these bitches
I'm hood, homie, so all eyes on me
When I'm balling down the block, that's why I'm glued to my Glock
And bring pain like rain, fuck a umbrella
It's GML in this bitch, so when you fucking tell it
Say it right, Big Snype don't fuck around
I'm on the block and got it locked like Nino Brown

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause you's a bitch just like the police
And I remember you was begging on your knees
And I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause you's a bitch just like the police
And I remember you was begging on your knees

[Outro: Deuce]
Yeah, I know you mad, homie
But you still can't see me
Yeah, Nine Lives, Undead, GML
You know you love this shit, yeah
