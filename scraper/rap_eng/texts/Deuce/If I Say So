[Hook]

They wanna know what's the next step
Every time I walk, I finesse
No worries man I'm not even pressed
I got it down packed no need to stress
If I say so, I say so (Say So I So) 4x


[Verse 1: ShannondaCANON]

Gotdamnit Ima boss (Ima boss)
Outchea and I'm sparking up the squad (SQUAD)
We dem goons that you shall never cross (nahh)
Don't lose ya life boy, that'll be ya loss
We awesome
We riding round
We bossin'
I'm doing things
You talking
What you talking bout, but..
You ain't talking about money
If you ain't talking bout money
Then what are we talking bout
Now I really have my doubts
I was all for it & now  I'm out

I do what I want cause... I say so
I live how I want cause... I say so
Windows rolled up cause... I say so
Open that door and let out that Indo

CANON you done yet
No I'm done yet
Got more demands gott bands
And hella 0s on the check
Once it's said in stone it's set
No question don't contest
All promises no threats
I say so ard bet

[Hook]

They wanna know what the next step
Every time I walk, I finesse
No worries man I'm not even pressed
I got it down packed no need to stress
If I say so, I say so (Say So I So) 4x

[Verse 2: Addie]

She say never been but she down to go
Summer breeze is a time of need I see palm trees in my rear view
No catching cases I'm trying to live this the long way
Taking chances living lavish the good things out in Bombay
We MIA you can try to find us
Lust for life only love to find us
La familia standing right beside me
If they don't like it you don't have to like us

Prime stars we paranormal
Red rovers til I'm all over
Goods vibes so the feeling's kosher
No escaping til the rush is over
I got the goods in my back pocket
Seen more plugs than any socket
Pa ro drive slow cause 5-O still trying clock me
My ex girl I know she a dime but lord knows I be losing change
Mary Jane keep the pain away she my little secret so who's to blame
Talk is cheap, with that good mart, rollback I mean Walmart
What goes around ya know comes around, that's Karma for ya, no Nascar, yeah
Cause If I Say So I Say So
So place ya bet cause we nothing like the rest of yall

[Hook/Outro]

They wanna know what the next step (what's the next step)
Every time I walk, I finesse (I finesse)
No worries man I'm not even pressed (I ain't even pressed)
I got it down packed no need to stress (I ain't stressing)
If I say so, I say so (Say So I So) (4x)

What...What...What
I Say So I say so 3x
And I say So I say so
I say so I say so 9x
