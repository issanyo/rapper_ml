[Verse 1]
Breathing this surface air
I feel that everyone's alone
And I can hold on tightly
Through all this pain you seem to go away
It's only me and you today
‎I feel all the rest of this gone away
Gone away

[Chorus]
So let me run where the sun is gone
I feel alone
It's taking me so long to know
Where the sun is gone?
I feel alone
It's taking me so long to know‎

[Verse 2]
Seeing you walk away
It's hurting me to play this game
I felt so lost and lonely
So much I wanted you to say to me...
It's only me and you today
I feel all the rest of this gone away
The things we used to be

[Chorus]
So let me run where the sun is gone
I feel alone
It's taking me so long to know
Where the sun is gone?
I feel alone
It's taking me so long to know‎
So let me run where the sun is gone
I feel alone
It's taking me so long to know
Where the sun is gone?
I feel alone
It's taking me so long to know‎
