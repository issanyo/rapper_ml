[Intro: Deuce & Jimmy Yuma]
Ooh, nice and chilly, huh?
So cold, yeah
Kinda happy that fool died, honestly
Why'd we even come?
Yee, let's go

[Verse 1: Deuce]
Never was a killer, but I spilled enough blood
Never thought I'd be the one to sweep your fucking ashes underneath my rug
People come, and people go, but I ain't people
So tell your people when they see me, they gon' feel the evil
You miss the past, thought them city lights would make you last
Now you're saying rest in peace, packing all your bags
Say goodbye, say goodbye, but save your last dance
Take your last glance at me now, it's your chance

[Chorus: Deuce]
Goodbye, goodbye, everything will be alright
Goodbye, goodbye, I promise I'll be by your side
Goodbye, goodbye and rest in peace alone
I wouldn't put a fucking flower on your gravestone
Goodbye, goodbye, everything will be alright
Goodbye, goodbye, I promise I'll be by your side
Goodbye, goodbye and rest in peace alone
I wouldn't put a fucking flower on your gravestone

[Verse 2: Deuce]
I used to be the boy, the only boy my mama had
Now I'm sitting in this house, underneath what passed
Clayton Ave, where we used to drink and laugh
Thinking what happened, how'd it happen, how I didn't see the past
Seemed like it all happened all too fast, thinking Sigh was my mast
I was caught up, lost in the mask
Now it's dark, and now it's black, I miss the contrast
You say it's black and white? Black and white my ass
And in these moments I've been wrong, these moments seem so long
Ticking on the clock till the moment's gone
And I don't wanna go back, relapse the day
Collapse the veins while I'm looking down the drain

[Chorus: Deuce]
Goodbye, goodbye, everything will be alright
Goodbye, goodbye, I promise I'll be by your side
Goodbye, goodbye and rest in peace alone
I wouldn't put a fucking flower on your gravestone
Goodbye, goodbye, everything will be alright
Goodbye, goodbye, I promise I'll be by your side
Goodbye, goodbye and rest in peace alone
I wouldn't put a fucking flower on your gravestone

[Verse 3: Deuce]
See, my conscience don't work no more, it don't hurt no more
And it don't hurt to see you lying, it don't work no more
So when I'm saying "stay away", realize I ain't fucking playing
Younger like my younger days, maybe hungry but I'm crazed
Raised by criminal ways, hear the chandelier break
It ain't no mistake, I'm waiting on Alana's grave
Ink and pictures for my veins, ain't no fucking ink for Jane
Inking for my brother's reign, on my arm, you'll see the same
And if I never see your face
I will always feel the same
Divide me from the wrong, so when I'm gone
My spirits will live on, let my lyrics show you God

[Chorus: Deuce]
Goodbye, goodbye, everything will be alright
Goodbye, goodbye, I promise I'll be by your side
Goodbye, goodbye and rest in peace alone
I wouldn't put a fucking flower on your gravestone
Goodbye, goodbye, everything will be alright
Goodbye, goodbye, I promise I'll be by your side
Goodbye, goodbye and rest in peace alone
I wouldn't put a fucking flower on your gravestone
