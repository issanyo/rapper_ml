[Verse 1: J-Dog & Funny Man]
From the front to the back, we attack
That's when the sky turns black
Divided by all their own means
Divided by lines you can't see
We raise our fist, you know we exist
You're scared of us because we influence your kids
And you pave the way that we walk
And you dug your grave, we won't stop
You know we got the Renholdër pulling at your head
Laying on your back, but you're better off dead
Got the army we made, with the dove and grenade
Got the pin pulled out, it's a fucking air raid
We ride like tanks and we bite like snakes
Search and destroy, we do whatever it takes

[Pre-Chorus: Da Kurlzz, J-Dog & Funny Man]
I'm Undead
When the shells hit the floor
You're Undead
Let's start a war

[Chorus: Deuce]
I'm the man and I'm the man, and everybody out there knows
That I'm the baddest, I'm the baddest of them all, and you just mad
'Cause I'm the man and I'm the man, and everybody out there knows
That I'm the baddest, I'm the baddest of them all, and you just mad, and it's so sad

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears & Charlie Scene]
The next time you breathe, you better think of me
And your prayers thank God for the mercy of me
An eye for an eye, but I don't need to see
Who needs eyes, motherfucker? I can feel you bleed
I got a plaque in the attic, and the bitch is gold
Not another word till I'm platinum now
A critic talks shit, watch a bitch get rolled
I only say "bitch" when I see a bitch, so
It's too late, there's no wait, it's Doomsday
This crusade's been erased by Tuface, so touche
You've gone past your due date, do you crave
Scene giving you a grenade toupée?
Down on your knees, crying for help
And you're just gonna be another notch on the belt

[Pre-Chorus: Da Kurlzz, J-Dog & Charlie Scene]
I'm Undead
And you can only blame yourself
You're Undead
And I'mma make it rain in hell

[Chorus: Deuce]
I'm the man and I'm the man, and everybody out there knows
That I'm the baddest, I'm the baddest of them all, and you just mad
'Cause I'm the man and I'm the man, and everybody out there knows
That I'm the baddest, I'm the baddest of them all, and you just mad, and it's so sad

[Outro: Da Kurlzz & J-Dog]
All hail, all hail
All hail, all hail
All hail Undead
All hail, all hail
All hail, all hail
All hail Undead
