[Intro: Charlie Scene]
Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show, bitch
Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show

[Verse 1: Charlie Scene]
Wake up, grab beer, grab rear, shave beard
Put on some scene gear
Gotta get drunk 'fore my mom wakes up
Break-up with my girlfriend so I can bang sluts
I'm Undead, unfed
Been sleeping on bunk beds since ten
So if I don't booze it, I'm gonna lose it
Everybody get to it, do it, get ruined

[Chorus: Deuce]
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
When I start drinking, my dick does all my thinking
Hoes want to be seen with me and I like their big, fake titties
D cups with extra filling, take it out, let me lick it quickly
Calm down, it's just a hickey, I'll blame it on this whiskey sipping
Gets me tipsy, drink fast and enjoy your buzz
Take back streets to avoid the fuzz
I wanna take you home but your friends won't let you
I got a 40 in my Ford Fiesta
Buy beer or pay the rent?
My signing bonus was quickly spent
So I'll beat my meat like I'm a fucking butcher
And I'll punk the pussy like I'm Ashton Kutcher

[Chorus: Deuce]
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping

[Verse 3: Charlie Scene]
Let's get this party jumping
Let's see some 40 chugging
I wanna see your booty rubbing
Against my dick when I start buzzing
Come on girls, I wanna see you drinking
I wanna see your brains start shrinking
Make a move, I saw you winking
Drunken pussy is what I'm thinking
I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance
Grab two hoes and do some body shots
I wanna party all night till they call the cops
Fuck a wristband, let's all do keg stand
I'm like Cheech, you got the Chong, hitting up this beer bong
When the cops show up, they're gonna get the finger
And I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm the designated drinker

[Chorus: Deuce]
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping

[Outro: Charlie Scene]
Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show, bitch
Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show
