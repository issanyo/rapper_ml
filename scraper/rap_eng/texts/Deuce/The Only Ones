[Hook]
We are the ones, we are the only ones
The only sun in your sky
As we come, can you hear the drums
Counting moments of life?

[Verse 1]
You stare so lost when lines are crossed
But need much more
You feel your heart beating apart
Lying on the floor
And now the questions start to come
Why do you still feel left undone?
But all I want to know
Is where I go when I'm done
(Staring at the sun)

[Hook]
We are the ones, we are the only ones
The only sun in your sky
As we come, can you hear the drums
Counting moments of life?

[Verse 2]
We're searching for something more
Than what we've got
It's not enough and giving up
Is our last shot
And everybody wants to say
When things don't go your way
Close your eyes and fade away
Until a new day has begun

[Hook]
We are the one, we are the only ones
The only sun in your sky
As we come can you hear the drums
Counting moments of life?

[Verse 3: Johnny 3 Tears]
Coming down like angel's wings
Drink on the top of some magazine
Powder on the glass smells like gasoline
My brain just keeps on vacuuming
Hiding in the tub with Rhapsody
Drowning oh-so happily
One more cut or catastrophe
Is this my blood or is it blasphemy?
I hear my voice keep asking me
"If I can't live what can I be?
If I can speak, why can't I scream?
If I can't die why can I bleed?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I want to know is where I go
When I'm done
(Staring at the sun)
We are the ones, we are the only ones
The only sun in your sky
As we come, can you hear the drums
Counting moments of life?

[Chorus]
We are the ones, we are the only ones
(Drowning)
The only sun in your sky
As we come, can you hear the drums
Counting moments of life?
