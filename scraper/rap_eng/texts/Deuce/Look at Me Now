[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated, alienated?
I don't think that you could ever make it
I ain't talking intoxicated
Talking about me incriminated
You felt amazing, alleviating
Knowing that I was isolated
Proud that you participated?
Well, guess what now, things are changing
I'll promise you that I ain't stopping, gonna be the greatest
Even though this life keeps throwing curves my way, more complicating
I came up fighting my way through this game fucking underrated
Even though these walls kept closing in on me, I aimed to play it

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that somewhere out there you are watching
I'm gonna make you proud, I am not stopping

[Chorus]
Look at me now
How far I've come, I hope that you're proud
I put my feet back on the ground
And I'm coming down from above the clouds
Look at me now
How far I've come since I've taken off this crown
I put my feet back on the ground
And I'm coming down, right here and now

[Verse 2]
I would never have thought I would be on top of these walls
Looking down on you all
Fuck it, I was a little off
Till I came back and stole the ball
It was a close call, up against the wall
But I ain't like y'all, I won't tuck my balls
In my tail like a fucking dog
Next time you see me, you're so fucking gone
I promised my people that I ain't never, ever walking
From the war they started, ain't gonna bow, you must be retarded
Even if the gates of heaven open up and I hear them knocking
I've gotta hold my ground till the end, homie, I got no option

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that somewhere out there you are watching
I'm gonna make you proud, I am not stopping

[Chorus]
Look at me now
How far I've come, I hope that you're proud
I put my feet back on the ground
And I'm coming down from above the clouds
Look at me now
How far I've come since I've taken off this crown
I put my feet back on the ground
And I'm coming down, right here and now

[Verse 3]
You're messing with the true villain
All your lines are already written
I do it one at a time, shoot 'em like Columbine
How the fuck am I to lose when I'm winning?
Just 'cause I'm already forgiven
Don't mean I won't slap the shit out of them bitches
You must be out of your mind if you think I'm soft on the inside
All that pussy talk, oh boy, it keeps me grinning
You enjoy making up these stories?
I kill it through all the guts and glory
You'll never know nothing 'bout me
So shut your mouth, you ain't got to worry
I got my people on every single jury
Don't wanna catch another case in a hurry
You tried to read through all my lines but they're blurry
You think I cleaned my fucking hands? They're still dirty!

[Chorus]
Look at me now
How far I've come, I hope that you're proud
I put my feet back on the ground
And I'm coming down from above the clouds
Look at me now
How far I've come since I've taken off this crown
I put my feet back on the ground
And I'm coming down, right here and now
Look at me now
Since I've taken off this crown
Look at me now
I've put my feet back on the ground

[Outro]
You're breaking into pieces
It's amazing that now you feel it
To change me, it'll take you
All the hate and that's part of me
