[Intro]
Yo, I guess we all change sometimes
Some for better and some for worse
Listen

[Chorus]
Here's the story of a snitch
That I knew so many years
But now he's a bitch
Fuck your feelings, he can suck my dick
Here's the story of a snitch
That I knew so many years
But now he's a bitch
Fuck your feelings, he can suck my dick

[Verse 1]
Look at all these fake-ass emcees
Claiming they rap, trying to spit just like me
But they don't have it, faggot, I was helping you maggots
Now I'mma show the world that you whack, bitch
And do what you can't do 'cause it haunts you
Dude, you're just so cool and I'm not you
Boo-hoo, you're a fool trying to fit in my shoes
Snoozing, drunk, puking, yeah, you're losing
I took my whole fanbase back, I managed
To get myself back up, back to rapping
I manned up even though I was backstabbed
Right in the back by my best friend, best friend?
Yeah, right, click-boom, goodnight
Some say there's two sides to the story
More like two knives, don't you worry
Two guys, when we're done, they'll be buried

[Chorus]
Here's the story of a snitch
That I knew so many years
But now he's a bitch
Fuck your feelings, he can suck my dick
Here's the story of a snitch
That I knew so many years
But now he's a bitch
Fuck your feelings, he can suck my dick

[Verse 2]
I created you from dirt, and this is how you pay me back?
Joining Lorene Drive just for tits and ass
I created every verse, every chorus
And you just stood there, thinking that you wrote it
I'm Spider-Man, bitch, I'll spin my webs
So quick around your heads
I'll turn this whole goddamn situation into one big mess
Till you're sitting at home, telling your son you're stressed
I came to cock-block and talk shit, so drop this
Put it in your iPod, jog, and rock this
Not this bitch again, telling everyone that I'm sick in the head
I ain't sick, bitch, stick to your meds
You even tried to bite my shit with MEST
But it fucked up your rep
The music you living is the music you hate
Quit telling people that I quit the band that I made

[Chorus]
Here's the story of a snitch
That I knew so many years
But now he's a bitch
Fuck your feelings, he can suck my dick
Here's the story of a snitch
That I knew so many years
But now he's a bitch
Fuck your feelings, he can suck my dick
Here's the story of a snitch
That I knew so many years
But now he's a bitch
Fuck your feelings, he can suck my dick
Here's the story of a snitch
That I knew so many years
But now he's a bitch
Fuck your feelings, he can suck my dick

[Outro]
Goddamn, why you jock my shit?
We are, we are, we are, we are the only ones
We are the only ones left, still we lead you on
