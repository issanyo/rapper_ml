[Chorus: Deuce]
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
I fucking swear that I care, but it's hard when you stare
Into the bottom of a bottle that is empty and bare
Oh, my desolate soul in my desolate home
It's my desolate role, yeah, I'm here all alone
I can't think of a reason to get the fuck out of bed
Curtains closed, lights are off, am I alive or dead?
I haven't shaved in a week, I always slur when I speak
Tolerance at its peak, another fifth just to sleep
Oh, woe is me, woe is me, I guess I need love
And hoes you see, hoes you see, I'm just in a rut
And I swear I'm trying, baby, please, baby, don't leave
Goddamn, I'm a fuck up but I guess that's just me
So I sit in my room and I cry in my bed
Thinking about all the shit that made me wrong in my head
I keep trying to climb, but it seems so steep
Pour myself a fucking whiskey and go back to sleep, bitch

[Chorus: Deuce]
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears]
I watch my mama cry, she says "baby, why?"
I say "baby died, baby's gone like a suicide"
I don't think you'll see him soon, Mom, stay out my room, Mom
Tell Daddy that I hate that motherfucker like you, Mom
I sing this shit for you Danny, Sascha, and Jordon
These beers keep getting warmer every time that I hold 'em
I pour this out for you like a partner in crime
It's a part of the times when you're sick in the mind
Yeah, I'm sick, oh, so sick, I'm so sick of this shit
Yeah, I'm lit, oh, so lit, I'm so fucked up off it
So I stumble around till I stumble fall down
Into this puddle of my tears laying here on the ground
When you've got nothing left you've got nothing left to lose
With my last, this single breath, I'll still be singing to you
So when you bury me, man, you better bury me deep
And sing along to this song 'cause you're broken like me

[Chorus: Deuce]
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home

[Bridge: Deuce]
And I wanna go back to the start
Back where we started from
And I know it's been so long
I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong all along
And I wanna go back to the start
Back where we started from
And I know it's been so long
I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong all along

[Chorus: Deuce]
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home
