[Intro: Deuce]
Haha, you fucking pussies
I'mma fuck with them a little on this one
Just a little
You fucking posers

[Chorus: Deuce]
You know we don't stop
Reloading while we hit the top
I get down 'cause that's my job
Y'all better learn to walk the walk
You know we don't stop
Reloading while we hit the top
I get down 'cause that's my job
Y'all better learn to walk the walk

[Verse 1: Deuce]
There's nothing you can do that'll make me angry
You can say the same shit, but I'll do the same thing
HU paved the way for me to make you crazy
Maybe I was sent here to make you take it in the ass
I'm back, it's Deuce, yoo-hoo
You can tell that slut Ke$ha to shoo-shoo
Oh boo-boo, did I make you hate me?
Who knew that I'd be the one to make it?!
Take this, bitch, 'course I'm a rapist
I'm Satan mixed with a little Dre, it's
Like a little game for you to say my name quick
'Cause I'm renegade, number one public enemy
You're a centipede, I'm the fire with the melody
Remember me? I'm a fucking true OG
On your knees, bitch, I'mma make you eat this
Don't speak when you're sucking on my penis, trick

[Chorus: Deuce]
You know we don't stop
Reloading while we hit the top
I get down 'cause that's my job
Y'all better learn to walk the walk
You know we don't stop
Reloading while we hit the top
I get down 'cause that's my job
Y'all better learn to walk the walk

[Verse 2: Gadjet]
It's Gad- to the -jet, and I'll slap the shit
Out of any motherfucker thinking they rapping sick
You ain't as sick, I'm the sickest prick, ask my bitch
I fucked her raw and gave her gono from my rashy dick
She traded me crabs and syphilis, but, homie, that's not it
Got herpes too on purpose, dude, I knew she had the shit
So what the fuck you gonna do to a masochist
Who's mad and pissed? Crazy, angry adjectives
Can't describe or justify the way I laughs at deaths
It's Nine Lives, I kill myself, it's not an accident
Focused like a terrorist, bomb strapped to my chest
Maybe I'll go play with razors while I slash my wrist
I'm dangerous on the stage, you had a mic, I snatched that shit
To Charlie Scene, it's probably mean, but I ain't mad at the kid
Deuce just put me in the booth, I'm better and faster than him
And tell the truth, you'd rather look at someone fatter or slim?

[Chorus: Deuce]
You know we don't stop
Reloading while we hit the top
I get down 'cause that's my job
Y'all better learn to walk the walk
You know we don't stop
Reloading while we hit the top
I get down 'cause that's my job
Y'all better learn to walk the walk

[Bridge: Deuce & Gadjet]
I got that forty-five
Tucked under my seat, that's right
I keep them pistols right by my side
'Case these fucks wanna die
You know you can't deny
When the bullets go off, they fly
Straight for your brain, I make them look nice
We gon' have a lot of fun tonight
Yeah, I'm young, but I'm still an OG
Them dudes might not, but they girlfriends know me
Dynamite hot, so they trying to blow me
I'mma take it to the top and shit on rappers below me

[Chorus: Deuce]
You know we don't stop
Reloading while we hit the top
I get down 'cause that's my job
Y'all better learn to walk the walk
You know we don't stop
Reloading while we hit the top
I get down 'cause that's my job
Y'all better learn to walk the walk
Bitch!
