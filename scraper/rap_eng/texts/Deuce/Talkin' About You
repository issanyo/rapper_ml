[Chorus: Deuce]
They're talking about you
As if all hell broke loose
They don't even know you
They're just lighting your fuse
They're talking about you
Like revenge is their tool
You're everybody's fool
Can't win, you'll just lose

[Verse 1: Gadjet]
When I walk through LA and it's smelling like death
I done murdered all these MCs, there ain't none left
Their bodies are fucking rotting, decomposing to flesh
One man responsible for all of this, just guess
Same one you can't keep up out your mouth, oh yes
The same one they keep asking about in the press
Who gives a shit? Like a magazine means success?
Make everybody fucking wonder what I'm gon' say next
Kerrang don't know a thing about rock unless
You focus on these pussy, emo, fucking pop projects
Then talk some shit about and diss the homie Deuce, no less?
Well, I can rock in, rock it like a rocket launcher to chest
So ticky-tock-tickety-tock, watch the clock and stress
Run up in your label, flip the table on the execs
Tell 'em all to kiss my ass when I jump on the desk
And show 'em what a fucking promise is instead of a threat

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce & Gadjet]
Mirror, mirror, answer me this
Will I pay for all of my sins?
If it is, let judgment begin
I'll keep marching on until then
Mirror, mirror, give me one wish
Give me strength so I don't give in
Heaven and hell, wherever I stand
I'll keep marching on till the end

[Chorus: Deuce]
They're talking about you
As if all hell broke loose
They don't even know you
They're just lighting your fuse
They're talking about you
Like revenge is their tool
You're everybody's fool
Can't win, you'll just lose

[Verse 2: Gadjet]
Who the hell wants to fuck with us? Nobody, they're in the dust
'Cause we left 'em whenever we stepped inside of the tour bus
Onto the next city with fans screaming for us
Vibing with hands up, sing along to the chorus
Hard to ignore us, that big of a fucking fuss
So much when they say our name, nobody can stay hush
Pretty girls with they face flush and red from when they blush
No need to have make-up whenever they face us
We give 'em a straight rush like we do to these fake fucks
Who can't entertain us, mainly 'cause they suck
I'd wish they'd just break up, these groups who just can't cut
It out and go about with me without getting ate up
I'm eating these rappers alive, filling my plate up
Became cannibalized like I'm at a buffet, stuffed
Still feeling my face up 'cause the hunger just stays stuck
It won't go away 'cause my tapeworm is duct taped up

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce & Gadjet]
Mirror, mirror, answer me this
Will I pay for all of my sins?
If it is, let judgment begin
I'll keep marching on until then
Mirror, mirror, give me one wish
Give me strength so I don't give in
Heaven and hell, wherever I stand
I'll keep marching on till the end

[Chorus: Deuce]
They're talking about you
As if all hell broke loose
They don't even know you
They're just lighting your fuse
They're talking about you
Like revenge is their tool
You're everybody's fool
Can't win, you'll just lose

[Verse 3: Deuce]
Is it because I wouldn't follow you to my self-destruction?
Or maybe it was because these words have so much more contradiction
This is my only addiction and way I get revenge
It's like you're my crucifixion, the sicker I get
I get more and more vicious so don't get me upset
Kids are paying to listen, you don't wanna accept
Then you're another victim of greatness and success
Cut the head off the chicken, he keeps on making sentences
He's so far from dead, bitches, he hopes that...

[Chorus: Deuce]
They're talking about you
As if all hell broke loose
They don't even know you
They're just lighting your fuse
They're talking about you
Like revenge is their tool
You're everybody's fool
Can't win, you'll just lose!

[Outro: Deuce]
No!
Can't win, you'll just lose
No!
Can't win, you'll just lose!
