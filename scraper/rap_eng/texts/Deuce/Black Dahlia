[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
I loved you, you made me, hate me, you gave me
Hate, see? It saved me and these tears are deadly
You feel that? I'd rip back every time you tried to steal that
You feel bad? You feel sad? I'm sorry, hell no, fuck that
It was my heart, it was my life, it was my start, it was your knife
This strife, it dies, this life and these lies
And these lungs have sung, this song for too long
And it's true, I hurt too, remember I loved you

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I've lost it all, fell today, it's all the same
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no
And I've been abused, I feel so used because of you
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no

[Verse 2: J-Dog]
I wish I could have quit you, I wish I never missed you
And told you that I loved you every time I fucked you
The future that we both drew and all the shit we've been through
Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew
How could you do this to me? Look at what I made for you
It never was enough and the world is what I gave to you
I used to be love-struck, now I'm just fucked up
Pull up my sleeve and see the pattern of my cuts

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I've lost it all, fell today, it’s all the same
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no
And I've been abused, I feel so used because of you
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no

[Bridge: Deuce & Charlie Scene]
Seems like all we had is over now
You left to rest
And your tears are dried up now
You just lay without a sound
Seems like all we had is over now
You left to rest
And my fears are over now
I can leave with my head down

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I've lost it all, fell today, it’s all the same
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no
And I've been abused, I feel so used because of you
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no

[Outro: Deuce & J-Dog]
I'm sorry
I used to be love-struck, now I'm just fucked up
I'm sorry
Pull up my sleeve and see the pattern of my cuts
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I used to be love-struck, now I'm just fucked up
I'm sorry
Pull up my sleeve and see the pattern of my cuts
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, no
