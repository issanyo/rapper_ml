[Verse 1]
I feel the pressure of my thoughts
And all that I have fought
Confusing!
My focus has begun to zoom
In you, I found this room
I'm fading away!

[Chorus]
Now I can see
You've gone away
To find me alone
It's so hard to hold on
Now I can see
You've gone away
To see me this way
It's so hard...
It's so hard...
It's so hard to hold on

[Verse 2]
My mind has turned around
But still, I hear no sound
Confusing!
The answers still don't seem so clear
In this, I've always feared
I'm fading away!

[Chorus]
Now I can see
You've gone away
To find me alone
It's so hard to hold on
Now I can see
You've gone away
To see me this way
It's so hard...
It's so hard...
It's so hard to hold on

[Bridge]
It's so hard to hold on

[Chorus]
Now I can see
You've gone away
To find me alone
It's so hard to hold on
Now I can see
You've gone away
To see me this way
It's so hard...
It's so hard...
It's so hard to hold on
