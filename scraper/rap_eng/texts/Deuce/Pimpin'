[Intro: Deuce]
Come on, everybody, throw your hands up
In the air, come on, let's
You know we keep the party jumping
So let's keep them 40's coming

[Chorus: Deuce]
Come on down to the city of LA, where we
We ride with gangsters and the pimping's easy
You know how we keep it bumping every day, baby
We ride with gangsters and the pimping's easy

[Verse 1: Charlie Scene & J-Dog]
When I ride with J-D-O-G
It's like, okay, basically
We get shitfaced and crazy
We're screaming "Fuck the police!"
J-just like Eazy, let's smoke these
With Old E and Charlie
We mix it over a hard beat
And roll with the Undead Army
And you don't need to see the best of me
The best MC, it's just the beat
Produca feeds and makes me mean
That seems to be what makes me scream
So, what up? Let's roll the town fucked up
Let's tag LA and show love
Yo, J-Dog, wait, just hold up
Take my mic, my P.O. showed up

[Chorus: Deuce]
Come on down to the city of LA, where we
We ride with gangsters and the pimping's easy
You know how we keep it bumping every day, baby
We ride with gangsters and the pimping's easy

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears & Funny Man]
We're six Caucasians, hell-raisin'
Blazin', makin' zero bacon
Awake to drink to stop to think
To call Funny to ride with me
My pants are so low
I'm sipping on this 4-0
Rolling in the four-door
Produca, me, and four hoesâ€”oh, no
The 5-0's rollin' code, I didn't stop or try to slow
Container's open, Funny's smokin'
I think I'm chokin', it's time to go, oh
These midnight dealers keep it rollin'
Keep the fucking Mad Dog flowin'
Los Angeles, we keep it goin'
Undead is what we're throwin'

[Chorus: Deuce]
Come on down to the city of LA, where we
We ride with gangsters and the pimping's easy
You know how we keep it bumping every day, baby
We ride with gangsters and the pimping's easy

[Verse 3: Deuce]
I keep on blowing up
My head keeps getting fatter every day, baby
On TV, you better listen
'Cause you know they'll play me
In the club, you in the corner
While my shit go crazy
And I got my soldiers in the back
So you don't wanna face me
And when your girl look up at me, I'm looking right down
And all that yapping, you know it gon' get you smacked down
I stick around to keep it mad while the crowd's loud
In the city of LA, that's my hometown

[Chorus: Deuce]
Come on down to the city of LA, where we
We ride with gangsters and the pimping's easy
You know how we keep it bumping every day, baby
We ride with gangsters and the pimping's easy
