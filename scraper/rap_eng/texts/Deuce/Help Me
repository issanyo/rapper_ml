[Intro: Deuce]
Help me, help me, help me
Help me, help me, help me

[Chorus]
Help me, I ain't got no brains
Help me, I can't feel no pain
Help me, I can't stand the rain
Help me 'fore I drift away
Help me, I ain't got no brains
Help me, I can't feel no pain
Help me, I can't stand the rain
Help me 'fore I drift away

[Verse 1]
I'm the George Bush of this rap shit,
You can tell Randy Jackson to kiss my black ass
I'm the white Obama, bitch, you can judge this
While I flip my middle finger off and let one out quick
I'm sick of these people trying to tell me what I got
Like it's down syndrome, it makes me wanna load a clip
And put a round in them, make 'em drown in with
These other rap stars who are clowns, it's sick
Like Monica Lewinsky sucking on a six-inch toothpick
Bitch just got her boobs did so she can do it, do it
And make a new clip till these kids download it
And you say I'm profound, shit
I ain't going down with my hand on my dick
While the next World Trade Center blows up quick
Hold up, I think you need another doughnut, Mr. Officer
Everybody, go nuts!

[Chorus]
Help me, I ain't got no brains
Help me, I can't feel no pain
Help me, I can't stand the rain
Help me 'fore I drift away
Help me, I ain't got no brains
Help me, I can't feel no pain
Help me, I can't stand the rain
Help me 'fore I drift away

[Verse 2: Deuce]
Look what I've become, this place that I begun
I started as The One and still don't give a fuck
These bitches get no love, no more grenade or dove
You're thirty, rapping? Ew, and still ain't got a buzz
You can dream, you can dream, but you're gonna suck
I got the voice and the looks, baby, turn it up
I don't need MTV when I sell this much
I'd rather be on Carson Daily than Oprah, son
I'mma be better than 'em, I'm a veteran kid
I came to get these kids off of medicine binges
Who's better than him? Not Murillo, that bitch
I told you once and I'mma tell you again
At least fight back, pussy, give me a challenge
I'm the boss, motherfucker, you don't want no static
B-O-S-S, Deuce is back, bitch
Yo, Truth, pass the automatic

[Chorus]
Help me, I ain't got no brains
Help me, I can't feel no pain
Help me, I can't stand the rain
Help me 'fore I drift away
Help me, I ain't got no brains
Help me, I can't feel no pain
Help me, I can't stand the rain
Help me 'fore I drift away

[Bridge]
These labels wanna put me away for good
They wanna keep me in the hood
But I keep swinging right back like you know I should
Making history in the books
You suck, there's no buts
The whole music industry can lick my nuts
Motherfucker, I ain't got no love
For a fake-ass wannabe Donald Trump.

[Chorus]
Help me, I ain't got no brains
Help me, I can't feel no pain
Help me, I can't stand the rain
Help me 'fore I drift away
Help me, I ain't got no brains
Help me, I can't feel no pain
Help me, I can't stand the rain
Help me 'fore I drift away

[Outro: Deuce]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, haha, yeah!
I ain't even gotta fucking try!
You know why? 'Cause I sound good whenever I talk
Whenever I spit, whenever I sing, bitch!
I'm the fucking white Obama, bitch
Yeah, aye, Yuma, let's get the fuck outta here!
