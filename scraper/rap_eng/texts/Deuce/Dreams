[Verse 1]
You showed me all of your dreams
You showed me all of your fears
Now I see that you're alone
Now I see that you're alone!

[Chorus]
Now I see that you fell apart again
And I can see that we're near the end
Now I see that you fell apart again
And I can see that there's nothing left

[Verse 2]
You made it harder to feel
You made me see everything
Now I see that you're alone
Now I see that you're alone!

[Chorus]
Now I see that you fell apart again
And I can see that we're near the end
Now I see that you fell apart again
And I can see that there's nothing left

[Bridge]
The nights go by
As you slip away
All these thoughts they're just a shade
Tomorrow's gone
So here's our song
Before the light goes, we'll stay long

[Chorus]
Now I see that you fell apart again
And I can see that we're near the end
Now I see that you fell apart again
And I can see that there's nothing left
