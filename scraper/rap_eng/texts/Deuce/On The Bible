Oh oh oh yeah

Because I need you there
I will swear on the bible
(I will swear) On the bible
I will swear on the bible

From the day I saw you
I just had to be with you
Only you, and only with you
From the moment you said yes
It was you and nothing less
Kiss after kiss after kiss after kiss after kiss
Oh oh oh yeah

On the bible I will swear
Swear to love you
And I will hope, cherish and obey
Because I need you there
I will swear on the bible
(I will swear) On the bible (I need you there)
I will swear on the bible

From the moment I saw you
I just knew that it was you
Only you, it had to be you
From the moment you said yes
It was you and nothing less
Kiss after kiss after kiss after kiss after kiss
Oh oh oh yeah

On the bible I will swear
Swear to love you
And I will hope, cherish and obey
Because I need you there
I will swear on the bible
(I will swear) On the bible (I need you there)
I will swear on the bible

I can make this promise
If I was really honest
I'd rather live for today
Come on girl, lets runaway
If you read my mind
I am your temptation
It's soft and sweet for you to be temptation
Throw caution to the wind
Lets dance, lets sing
