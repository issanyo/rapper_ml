[Chorus]
It's a new day, out of my way
Here I come now to the new age
It's a new change on a new plane
Push me around, I feel no pain
It's a new day, out of my way
Here I come now out of my cage
It's a new change on a new wave
Push me around, I'm not moving

[Verse 1]
What happened to rock and rapping?
These white boys trying to Backstreet they asses,
Back in? The game done already had them
I handed they asses back at 'em
Madness occurred after that shit
It happens, thank God I had him
Asking why the fuck he ever came
In the first place with them cameras rolling in action
Escaped it, face it, it's too late, bitch
I'm gone now, chasing all that fame, haha
Racing and it only took one day, yeah
To write this whole song, homie's still on probation
Entertaining and educating all these kids
About my childhood must help this nation
Amen, will God save all these faggots?
Damn Aron, maybe you shouldn't say that

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never felt like this before
Like I'm sober
I'm breaking the rules that you follow
Invincible

[Chorus]
It's a new day, out of my way
Here I come now to the new age
It's a new change on a new plane
Push me around, I feel no pain
It's a new day, out of my way
Here I come now out of my cage
It's a new change on a new wave
Push me around, I'm not moving

[Verse 2]
How does it feel to have no power
You only get it from sniffing powder
Downers, uppers for cowards
Wowzers, and you push me around-er?
Downwards is where you're going for now-ward
Yowzers, still complaining about your
Album like you were supposed to go platinum?
How can that happen, that I can't even fathom
Random how you went from digging in trash cans
On the streets of Hollywood to joining a clown clan
Bow down, on your knees, balls on your chin now
How about some deep-throating, let it all go down
Stick to your town, I'm here with Deuce Nation
Split it right there in the middle at Gower, blaow-blaow
Don't worry about our last encounter
Been counting all the minutes my final hour

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never felt like this before
Like I'm sober
I'm breaking the rules that you follow
Invincible

[Chorus]
It's a new day, out of my way
Here I come now to the new age
It's a new change on a new plane
Push me around, I feel no pain
It's a new day, out of my way
Here I come now out of my cage
It's a new change on a new wave
Push me around, I'm not moving

[Bridge]
Remember me?
I watched your whole castle crumble
Right by your side when you were in trouble
Remember me?
I loved watching you struggle
Trying to hit notes, the industry puzzled
Remember me?
Always pretending that you were my brothers
So I could get closer to you fuckers
Remember me?
And when we drank, I barely would ever guzzle
Right behind your back was counting the numbers
Oh shit
Damn, Big Deuce
Haha, you know what it is
Let's go

[Chorus]
It's a new day, out of my way
Here I come now to the new age
It's a new change on a new plane
Push me around, I feel no pain
It's a new day, out of my way
Here I come now out of my cage
It's a new change on a new wave
Push me around, I'm not moving

[Outro]
Remember me?
I watched your whole castle crumble
Right by your side when you were in trouble
Remember me?
I loved watching you struggle
Trying to hit notes, the industry puzzled
Remember me?
Always pretending that you were my brothers
So I could get closer to you fuckers
Remember me?
And when we drank, I barely would ever guzzle
Right behind your back was counting the numbers
