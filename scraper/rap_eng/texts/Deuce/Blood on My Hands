[Intro: Deuce & Truth]
Got some screws loose in me
We gon' ride all night long
You don't want it with me
Truth's got my back, I got Nine Lives
Hey yo, man
It's going crazy in the hood, man
We're trying to eat, man
Yeah...

[Verse 1: The Truth]
Buckle up your seatbelts, let me take you on a ride
Just got the new Benz all thanks to the white
Man, I walk the walk, y'all talk the talk
This shit's too easy, it's like a walk in the park
At seventeen, I watched grams turn into halves
Clockwork in the hood, all turn into cash
Easy come, easy go, so it all went fast
Cruising on Russel Ave, I slowed up the whip
Sick style, four five sitting by my hip
I got Hollyhood all under control
I got a few strippers coming down the pole
I know a few killers into every corner store
Man, when it's time for work, I put in work
I don't phone up the next man to handle my dirt
I'mma keep it street, man, love me or hate me
Posted in my neck of the woods, the gun on safety

[Chorus: Deuce]
I got blood on my hands
And these streets keep getting colder
But I won't stop for nothing, no
Forty-four mag, tuck them guns
There's blood on my hands
And these streets keep getting colder
But this time it's me and Truth, we getting down
'Cause in the land of the dead, I wear the crown

[Verse 2: Truth]
I was put away, I came back like karma
These streets is crazy, it's hot like sauna
I don't nine to five, fuck slow money
I hustle my hustle, sweeter than honey
My flows is dynamite, I'm bound to blow
I'm living the fast life, riding slow
Grace was a burden, in rotation
The streets is quiet, you can feel the tension
I hustle the hustler, I keep them in pocket
All eyes on me like the red carpet
Got guns, meet you off of Cinco, you're shook
What happens in Hollyhood stays in Hollyhood
We do it like them Italians back in the days
Start spraying shit up with Tommies and AKs
I am the General, what I say goes
Even though I'm the boss, I still stay on my toes

[Chorus: Deuce]
I got blood on my hands
And these streets keep getting colder
But I won't stop for nothing, no
Forty-four mag, tuck them guns
There's blood on my hands
And these streets keep getting colder
But this time it's me and Truth, we getting down
'Cause in the land of the dead, I wear the crown

[Verse 3: Truth]
Art of War gave me a whole lot of wisdom
48 Laws of Power told me how to finish him
I've gassed up my tank, got them plenty of fuel
I'm getting more attention than the new kid at school
Big Sammy told me once, "never look back"
I've been killing the game ever since that
No father to guide me, had to grow up quick
It's me against the world as I'm holding my dick
I'm climbing up the ladder, ain't no stopping me
I got the blueprints, I'm playing Monopoly
Used to sit in my cell, open up the Bible
Trying to kill myself, feeling suicidal
I'm a man, I'mma hold my ground
I promised my dad I won't let my mom down
We all make mistakes, don't y'all understand?
I am the Truth, I am what I am

[Chorus: Deuce]
I got blood on my hands
And these streets keep getting colder
But I won't stop for nothing, no
Forty-four mag, tuck them guns
There's blood on my hands
And these streets keep getting colder
But this time it's me and Truth, we getting down
'Cause in the land of the dead, I wear the crown
