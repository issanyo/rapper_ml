[Intro: Deuce & The Truth]
Truth, Deuce, Jeffree Star
She wants to lick my body, and I want to lick her body
So let's all have a party, lick each other, let's get naughty
She thinks that I'm a hottie, and I know she likes it doggy
Ooh, ahh, ladee dadee, ooh, ahh, touch my body

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, let's get freaky now, lick you all up and down
I got them lips, I'll make you drip till you twist all around
I wanna feel them legs 'cause it ain't time for sex
You've got them hips, you've got them lips, I wanna feel the rest

[Verse 1: Jeffree Star]
I like boys and girls and rock stars
Even virgins wanna come into my snack bar
Don't hate me 'cause I fucked your favorite band
Beer bottle up my pussy, let's do a keg stand
And let me show you how to sit on that dick
America's Next Top Model, click, click
I'm the ring-leader, girls follow my trends
Got Hannah Montana doing anal with my friends
Pull my hair, scratch my back, beat me like Rihanna
I love ass-to-mouth and black cock like Obama
We showed you how to Turn Off the Lights
So give me some fucking Twilight neck bites
Deuce is gonna get your coochie real loose
So I'mma line up your men and play Duck, Duck, Goose

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, let's get freaky now, lick you all up and down
I got them lips, I'll make you drip till you twist all around
I wann feel them legs 'cause it ain't time for sex
You've got them hips, you've got them lips, I wanna feel the rest

[Verse 2: Deuce]
Oh, look who's back with his favorite transvestite
In the back, sitting VIP, that's right
And you're still waiting outside with a girl
Mad 'cause I got through the front line
With a gun, yeah, it's all fun
Till you're laid out with your brains out
And you end up on the other side of the club with your face down
While the club bangs out of control
It's out of this world
The way you shake them hips make me like "damn girl"
The way them lips taste makes me think damn sure
That you're sucking dick straight from the men's bathroom
A little drip, drip 'cause you stuck your dick quick
Inside some bitch and then you realized "oh shit"
Took that shit out, and it smelled like cold fish
A little chlamydia ain't gon' do shit

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, let's get freaky now, lick you all up and down
I got them lips, I'll make you drip till you twist all around
I wanna feel them legs 'cause it ain't time for sex
You've got them hips, you've got them lips, I wanna feel the rest

[Verse 3: The Truth]
I'm from the West Coast, Bentleys and palm trees
You can tell he's Armenian, looking at his car keys
Got a problem? Add it up, damn right, I'm tatted up
California, stand up and go and put your hands up
I'm sipping on whatever so she can look better
I don't want no problem, so I brought the condoms
Truth is in the house, she must be in some luck
I seen her at the club and heard she wanna fuck
I'm gangster like white walls, sitting on a Regal
I hear no, I see no, I speak no evil
Rock your boat, baby, I'm the coolest skipper
Live up in this hospital, ain't nobody sicker
I'm balling, baby, my jewels speak for itself
Got the LVs on the bag just to match the belt
I like the smiles on your bitch, and that's a fact
I'll put some miles on your bitch and send her ass back

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, let's get freaky now, lick you all up and down
I got them lips, I'll make you drip till you twist all around
I wanna feel them legs 'cause it ain't time for sex
You've got them hips, you've got them lips, I wanna feel the rest

[Bridge: Deuce & Truth]
These ladies go crazy
They wanna have all my babies
They love me 'cause I'm famous
And haters hate that I made it
Oh baby, oh baby
Let me get in your Mercedes
I know you got a friend or two maybe
I hope she ain't think we dating
I'm heroin, I'm like ecstasy
All these girls want sex from me
Blowing up my phone, always texting me
All they wanna do is get next to me
I'm schizo, I'm loco
They mad 'cause I'm rolling solo
While I'm rich, trying to get that mo' dough
And in the bed, these girls say I'm a mofo

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, let's get freaky now, lick you all up and down
I got them lips, I'll make you drip till you twist all around
I wanna feel them legs 'cause it ain't time for sex
You've got them hips, you've got them lips, I wanna feel the rest

[Outro: Jeffree Star & Deuce]
Hahaha, you know you like that, hoe
Damn girl, hahaha
You know what it is, Nine Lives
Bitch
