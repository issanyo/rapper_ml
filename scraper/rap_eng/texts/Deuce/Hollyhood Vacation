[Intro: Deuce & The Truth]
Yeah, Nine Lives
California, Hollyhood
Got the liquor, feeling good
Cali' bud, light it up
Get your money, that's what's up
Yeah, that's me from the streets
In the car with my heat
What you need?
V-I-who? V-I-what? You with me

[Chorus: Deuce]
Sh-shake it to the front, sh-shake it to the back
Now turn it all around, show me how you shake that ass
I'm in the club getting buzzed, yeah, I'm faded
And baby mama, if you wanna, we can make it
Sh-shake it to the front, sh-shake it to the back
Now turn it all around, show me how you shake that ass
I'm in the club getting buzzed, yeah, I'm faded
And baby mama, if you wanna, we can make it

[Verse 1: Truth]
Yeah, just close your eyes completely shut, open your eyes and face The Truth
Marinate facts, observe the scene, GML, respect the roots
Money, money, I get it, get it, hustle hard, no looking back
Shake them haters, that's for real, make some moves and watch me stack
I'm hood, baby, can't you tell? Hollywood, fuck Glendale
Oh well, I went to jail, guess what? Deuce got bail
Nine Lives, off my chain, I'm cuckoo, so insane
Mona Lisa, perfect picture, got beef, my pistol get you
Chuck Taylors, white T's, low riders, man, please
Back up off me, you fucking chump, turn this up and let it bump
Ruthless cats on my team, nightmare, I'm in your dream
You're the crop, I'm the cream, I'm the hustler, you're the fiend
Back it up, shake that ass, me and Deuce, no need to ask
He gone crazy, lost his mask, I gone crazy and got his back
Lights on, lights off, it's about to spark off
Flow is so heavy, it'll knock your socks off

[Chorus: Deuce]
Sh-shake it to the front, sh-shake it to the back
Now turn it all around, show me how you shake that ass
I'm in the club getting buzzed, yeah, I'm faded
And baby mama, if you wanna, we can make it
Sh-shake it to the front, sh-shake it to the back
Now turn it all around, show me how you shake that ass
I'm in the club getting buzzed, yeah, I'm faded
And baby mama, if you wanna, we can make it

[Verse 2: Deuce]
This shit's so easy, you see me, you can't believe that it's me
"Oh my god, he's in all my dreams", "Oh my god, you know how to sing?"
"Oh my god, it's you, is this real?", yeah, you see me sitting and drinking
You see me sitting, I'm thinking, she thinks I'm easy, believe me
When she comes home there's no teasing, and there's no speaking, you feel me?
She wants to fuck with no rubber, she gon' think I'mma love her
Bitch, better stay in the covers 'cause we ain't gonna be lovers
Just take your pants off and cuddle, don't call your man 'cause it's trouble
If he comes back, I'mma shovel a hole so deep in my yard
I'll let him sleep with the sharks and fishes, so don't be alarmed
When I take the keys to your car, yeah, we ain't gotta be buddies
Or hug inside of no club, we ain't gotta make nothing public, so fuck it
'Cause next week I'll be having models and bottles
Inside my one-room apartment, that's when this shit gets retarded
And bitches start seeing doubles of me and wake up in trouble with me
"She's only seventeen, man!" That's when they call the police

[Chorus: Deuce]
Sh-shake it to the front, sh-shake it to the back
Now turn it all around, show me how you shake that ass
I'm in the club getting buzzed, yeah, I'm faded
And baby mama, if you wanna, we can make it
Sh-shake it to the front, sh-shake it to the back
Now turn it all around, show me how you shake that ass
I'm in the club getting buzzed, yeah, I'm faded
And baby mama, if you wanna, we can make it

[Bridge: Truth]
Oh, I'm back, the Truth, that's that
I'm a star like Terry O, short bus, retarded flow
Want the money plus the fame, run rap mando
I'm fast, faster than a honey mustard lambo
Moving through an open road, worldwide, around the globe
What's the streets without the code? Escobar without the blow?
Jibberjabber, yap-yap, competition, where you at?
All you suckers, I don't slack, got a problem, do the math

[Chorus: Deuce]
Sh-shake it to the front, sh-shake it to the back
Now turn it all around, show me how you shake that ass
I'm in the club getting buzzed, yeah, I'm faded
And baby mama, if you wanna, we can make it
