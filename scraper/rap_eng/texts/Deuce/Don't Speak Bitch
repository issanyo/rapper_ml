[Intro]
Yeah, this song is dedicated to you punk-ass motherfuckers
Nine Lives

[Chorus]
Don't speak bitch, just die, die, die
Why can't you go bye, bye, bye?
'Cause I will take your life away
So turn around and just walk away

[Verse 1]
It's my flow, my show, so b-back up
I'm huge, I'm big, you're a jack-off
I'm cool, you ain't, you're another cracker
I'm bad, I'm back, so get ready, blast off
I'm the king, the mean one, I bring the heat on
You ain't got the smarts, so take a seat, son
You're a peon, and you're getting peed on
And I'mma let the world watch while I sing songs

[Chorus]
Don't speak bitch, just die, die, die
Why can't you go bye, bye, bye?
'Cause I will take your life away
So turn around and just walk away
Don't speak bitch, just die, die, die
Why can't you go bye, bye, bye?
'Cause I will take your life away
So turn around and just walk away

[Verse 2]
Back up, back up 'fore you end up smacked up
Stand up, stand up, let me see your hands up
I'm back with another can full of whoop ass
For these fags kissing on each other's asses
I'mma shit on you, so take a minute, fool
Before you open your mouth and I spit on you
While my shit plays straight from your living room
I'll let the whole world watch while I finish you

[Chorus]
Don't speak bitch, just die, die, die
Why can't you go bye, bye, bye?
'Cause I will take your life away
So turn around and just walk away
Don't speak bitch, just die, die, die
Why can't you go bye, bye, bye?
'Cause I will take your life away
So turn around and just walk away

[Bridge]
Don't speak bitch, just die, die, die
Why can't you go bye, bye, bye?
'Cause I will take your life away
So turn around and just
Shut the fuck up, just shut your mouth
Shut the fuck up before I break your mouth, I'll take you out
Shut the fuck up, just shut your mouth
Shut the fuck up before I break your mouth, I'll take you out

[Chorus]
Don't speak bitch, just die, die, die
Why can't you go bye, bye, bye?
'Cause I will take your life away
So turn around and just walk away
Don't speak bitch, just die, die, die
Why can't you go bye, bye, bye?
'Cause I will take your life away
So turn around and just walk away
