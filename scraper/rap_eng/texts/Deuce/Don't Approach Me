[Intro: Male & female police officers]
Suspect was last seen in the rear entrance of the club
10-4, do you have a description?
Uh, yeah, suspect is white male, approximately 5'8"-5'10", medium build, 18 to 20 years, short hair, wearing blue jeans, running shoes, black T-shirt. Copy that?

[Chorus: Deuce]
This is for you fags, when you ride, don't approach me
This is for you fucks, when you die, don't approach me
Go on, run your mouth where you hide, don't approach me
You're looking like a bitch, you're a coward, you ain't shit

[Verse 1: Deuce]
You fuel the fucking flame in my heart, yep, yep
Makaveli's got me evil, so evil, so weak, but so strong
A lady named Sigh's got my secrets, my spirits
And you gon' have to kill her to defeat me
Yeah, give me one, give me two, three, four, five shots
While I'm rolling in the Benz with The Truth, pop-pop
A shotgun in the back, yeah, it's loaded, yeah, it's cocked
Hollywood, throw your hands up, where you at?
I ain't got no fucking ice on my fingers
Just ten broken bones on your throat till you ain't breathing
Yeah, you know where I live, you're a bitch, you got shit
Take your best shot on the west side, I got Nine Lives
Try to see through my eyes? No, you can't, nope
Watch my pearly whites shine while I laugh
You better catch me in the club falling down
Don't need a nine to take your one life

[Chorus: Deuce]
This is for you fags, when you ride, don't approach me
This is for you fucks, when you die, don't approach me
Go on, run your mouth where you hide, don't approach me
You're looking like a bitch, you're a coward, you ain't shit
This is for you fags, when you ride, don't approach me
This is for you fucks, when you die, don't approach me
Go on, run your mouth where you hide, don't approach me
You're looking like a bitch, you're a coward, you ain't shit

[Verse 2: Deuce]
Just remember I ain't stopping for nothing, made it from nothing to something
Feel the bass pop when it's thumping, I see you hiding and running
You know it's Judgement Day, keep on running
You hear my shit when it's bumping and pray to God I ain't coming
I bleed a little bit of me when I speak, I'm speaking to my enemies
Ain't no heroes in this life of mine
Ain't no fucking rhyme that be written how I feel inside
You gon' fucking hear me when I'm speaking, when I'm heated, heated like a nine millimeter
There ain't no fucking pictures here left to paint, homie
Except the portrait of Miss Johnny 3, blow me
I can joke; if you wanna choke, we can go
To the throat, till you're bleeding on your hardwood floor
No matter the place, no matter the time, no matter the race
I'm leaving, you hating me 'cause there ain't no more changing me
I'm the whitest of the white, the rawest of the raw
I'm laughing on the inside screaming "Fuck you all!"
Fox11 better come and change my shit, bitch
So twenty-three attorney generals can suck my dick
While I'm sitting in the back of a white and black Vick
Chained up and I still don't give a shit

[Chorus: Deuce]
This is for you fags, when you ride, don't approach me
This is for you fucks, when you die, don't approach me
Go on, run your mouth where you hide, don't approach me
You're looking like a bitch, you're a coward, you ain't shit
This is for you fags, when you ride, don't approach me
This is for you fucks, when you die, don't approach me
Go on, run your mouth where you hide, don't approach me
You're looking like a bitch, you're a coward, you ain't shit
