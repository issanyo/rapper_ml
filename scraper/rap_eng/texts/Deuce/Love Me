[Hook]
The [tear] drops are getting in my shoes and laces alone can't take away my blues. Are you only passing through or are you gonna love me?

[Deuce]
I guess we all change sometimes...some for better...some for worse

[Vegas]
Man they say that the good die young
But if thats true, when does my time come?
Now im just feeling awful dog
Losing you has got me going off the wall
And if I lost Nicole
To the same shit id drop and fall
Without you I feel so empty
To let it all go now is so tempting
Really hope that you miss me much
Everytime we hug, we kiss, we touch
I get a sensation; a different rush
Feels like another one had bit the dust
Your fucking crazy but im nuts as well
Fuck it, its like im stuck in a rut
And its cuz im in love wit a couple of sluts
And im done with this, I just feel so upset
And I know that I need to stop breathing
For me to stop grieving
Your not the girl that I used to know (know)

You play with triggers they bound to shoot
I ball all day now talk about hoops

[Denace]
I love you I hate you
Ive done alot but youre ungrateful
I know that one day you realize
That im nothing like them other guys
Itll be too late then
So dont come back like ive mistaken
Cuz by then ill be taken
And my love for you will be vacant
I dont wanna sound like a prick bitch
But I hope karma shits on your wishlist
And makes you cook and do the dishes
And tells you to stay out of his business
I dont think you know who you fucking with
But I got videos of you suckin dick
I should release them fucking bitch
But I won't cuz I love your fuckin kid
