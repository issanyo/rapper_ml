[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of hiding, running
Tired of all the lying
It's like we never stop fighting
Until someone is dying
It's too hard to keep on smiling
When this hate keeps on rising
Even hard to keep surviving
When this war is all they're buying
It's so binding, vilifying
But I know I can't stop trying
Terrifying, terrorizing
I can't stop, they're right behind me
Will I survive all the nights on my own?
Or will I be left just to dry like a bone?
I'm on thin ice and there's nowhere to go!
Take my hand now and just lead me back home

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so far away
From who I used to be
I want to be free
Will I ever see?

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like this world is gonna take me under
Sometimes it feels like there's nothing left but rain and thunder
I wonder if I'll ever wake up from this
I've been counting all the days, waiting to recover
Sometimes it feels like this world is gonna pull me under
Sometimes it feels like my life is just another number
I wonder if I'll ever wake up from this dream
I've been counting all the days, waiting to scream!

[Verse 2]
We keep going around in circles
We've learned to be so hurtful
In the end, was it all worth it?
When you thought it would all be perfect
All I hear is a voice cursing
While the real ones are smirking
I thought that peace would be returning
But the tables keep on turning
In my mind I keep utilizing
That this is what we've decided
I keep trying to defy it
But all hope is lost, we're dying
Will I be lost somewhere far, the unknown?
There might be a place in our hearts we can go
It's been a while since we learned to come home!
Nothing can stop us now that we know

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so far away
From who I used to be
I want to be free
Will I ever see?

[Chorus: Deuce]
Sometimes it feels like this world is gonna take me under
Sometimes it feels like there's nothing left but rain and thunder
I wonder if I'll ever wake up from this
I've been counting all the days, waiting to recover
Sometimes it feels like this world is gonna pull me under
Sometimes it feels like my life is just another number
I wonder if I'll ever wake up from this dream
I've been counting all the days, waiting to scream!

[Bridge]
Just to breathe!
From above it's still hard to see
What's real in me!
There's nowhere safe that I can be
So help me 'cause I'm venting
All this pain, entering
This ending, my remedy
Is pretending like enemies

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like this world is gonna take me under
Sometimes it feels like there's nothing left but rain and thunder
I wonder if I'll ever wake up from this
I've been counting all the days, waiting to recover
Sometimes it feels like this world is gonna pull me under
Sometimes it feels like my life is just another number
I wonder if I'll ever wake up from this dream
I've been counting all the days, waiting to scream!

[Outro]
I'm so far away!
From who I used to be!
I want to be free!
Will I ever see?
I've been counting all the days waiting to scream!
