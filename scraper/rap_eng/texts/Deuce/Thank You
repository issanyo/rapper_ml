[Verse 1]
It feels like forever since I've been gone
I know I couldn't have made it back on my own
It was raining more than ever, I know
You gave me a second chance just like before
Now I'm not alone, I crawled out of this hole
Did what I was told, made it out the cold
I was losing my hope, my freedom, my own strength
I could barely hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
So when my times comes
Please forgive what I've become
Yeah, when the time comes
Will you sing me one last song?

[Chorus]
Thank you, thank you for that
You gave me one more chance
This is not the end but where it began
Thank you, thank you for that
You let me live again
This is not the end, this is where it all began

[Verse 2]
We used to be stronger than we were, now
We could have almost anything but fell down
Didn't think that I'd make it but somehow
Just like a friend, you managed to come back around
The voices were loud, knees were on the ground
As if I had drowned, couldn't make it out
I was losing my hope, my freedom, my own strength
Couldn't see through the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
So when my time comes
Please forgive what I've become
Yeah, when the time comes
Will you sing me one last song?

[Chorus]
Thank you, thank you for that
You gave me one more chance
This is not the end, but where it began
Thank you, thank you for that
You let me live again
This is not the end, this is where it all began

[Bridge]
In the end, we'll pretend
We'll do it all over again
Between life and death, hold your breath
Remember times we were our best
Go 'head, tell them all we're not stopping
Ain't go no time for rest

[Chorus]
Thank you, thank you for that
You gave me one more chance
This is not the end, but where it began
Thank you, thank you for that
You let me live again
This is not the end, this is where it all began
