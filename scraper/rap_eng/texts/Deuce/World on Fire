[Intro: Deuce]
This world is on fire
This world is on fire

[Chorus: Deuce]
This world is on fire, we're restless and we're tired
Is there someplace other than this, maybe somewhere higher?
I don't hear no choir, all I see are liars
Is there someplace other than this, maybe somewhere higher?

[Verse 1: Deuce]
It's hard to make it in a world wasted
All this hatred, I'm impatient
All these changes, different places
Looking sacred, got the aces
Lot of faces, look what we're facing
Across a nation, who can make it?
Yeah, we're racing, I can taste it
Who can change it? It's the Matrix

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
Everything has its turn
After all we've learned
What is it we've earned
Just to watch it burn!

[Chorus: Deuce]
This world is on fire, we're restless and we're tired
Is there someplace other than this, maybe somewhere higher?
I don't hear no choir, all I see are liars
Is there someplace other than this, maybe somewhere higher?

[Verse 2: Deuce]
Empire's fallen, help is calling
Though we all win, we keep crawling
There ain't no sin that we'll fall in
It looks so dim, but we're all in
Through the cold wind, we can see in
We ain't leaving what we believe in
If it's freezing, ain't no reason
We're still breathing, sun is screaming

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
Everything has its turn
After all we've learned
What is it we've earned
Just to watch it burn!

[Chorus: Deuce]
This world is on fire, we're restless and we're tired
Is there someplace other than this, maybe somewhere higher?
I don't hear no choir, all I see are liars
Is there someplace other than this, maybe somewhere higher?

[Verse 3: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
Above the carnage, couldn't stop it
Where we started, it was promised
All departed, almost lost it
It restarted through the hardship
Was abolished but accomplished
It was rotted, went the farthest
Earth demolished, wasn't gone yet
Not forgotten, forgive our sins

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
Everything has its turn
After all we've learned
What is it we've earned
Just to watch it burn!

[Chorus: Deuce]
This world is on fire, we're restless and we're tired
Is there someplace other than this, maybe somewhere higher?
I don't hear no choir, all I see are liars
Is there someplace other than this, maybe somewhere higher?

[Outro]
Maybe somewhere higher
Maybe somewhere higher
Maybe somewhere higher
