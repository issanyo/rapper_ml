[Intro: Charlie Scene & Deuce]
Get, get, get drunk, let's
Get, get, get drunk, let's
Get, get, get drunk, let's
Get, get, get

[Chorus: Deuce]
California, show me love, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, throw it up, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, show me love, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, so high, we'll ride all night

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
Coming straight outta Cali', the 818 valley
323, fucking Horse Nut Alley
And from Highland to Clayton, all these bitches are hating
'Cause the shit that we're saying, but it's our shit that they're playing
If we don't make it, we'll take it; if it ain't real, then we'll fake it
Open your mouth and I'll break it, don't give a fuck if you hate it
We're looking for the six chicks down with the six dicks
Rolling on tens, getting buzzed, it's ridiculous
Horny like a sickness, quickies with the quickness
Pussy like it's business, work it like it's fitness
Listen while I spit this, game at all these bitches
Now I'm gonna hit this and fuck it till I'm dickless

[Chorus: Deuce]
California, show me love, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, throw it up, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, show me love, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, so high, we'll ride all night

[Verse 2: J-Dog]
Let's get the girls to the front, let's put the sluts in the back
Let's push 'em all together now, let's put 'em on our laps
Alcohol and drugs and California love
They got me ready to party, all this weed and Bacardi
From the north to the south, this state's all about
Silicone lips and all the fake tits
California girls, best in the world
Best in the backseat, so let's get fucking nasty
I'm a pirate on the streets of Ca-California
Moving and cruising, we're boozing all night till the morning
So from dusk till dawn, you know Undead is always on
Hit it once like a bong, hit it twice and then I'm gone

[Chorus: Deuce]
California, show me love, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, throw it up, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, show me love, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, all night till the morning

[Bridge: Deuce]
You don't wanna step on up
We leave the club fucked up
Come on down and say "what's up?"
Don't front 'cause I ain't buzzed
Johnny's here to fuck you up
J-Dog, pass the 40 up
You know I'll be here all night
And Undead till the day we die

[Chorus: Deuce]
California, show me love, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, throw it up, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, show me love, get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, all night till the morning

[Outro: Charlie Scene & Deuce]
Get, get, get drunk, let's
Get buzzed, let's get fucked up
Get, get, get drunk, let's
Get buzzed, let's get fucked up
Get, get, get drunk, let's
Get buzzed, let's get fucked up
California, so high, we'll ride all night
