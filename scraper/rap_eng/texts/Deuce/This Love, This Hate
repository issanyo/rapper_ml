[Verse 1: Deuce]
In a time of need
Only few can see what's wrong
Millions tend to crawl
But only those who choose can make it through this all
Only few can sing like lions
'Cause we sing until we're gone
And we've got each other's backs
Until we're back where we belong
A woman held my shield
And through the battle we did wrong
A man who taught me wisdom
Through the static we recall
And maybe when we're gone
Our names will echo through the stars
Every start's got its ending
Even when we've learned to rise above it all

[Chorus: Deuce]
These lies are leading me astray
It's too much for me to stay
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly
I see you, so please stay strong
I'll sing you one last song, and then I'm gone
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

[Verse 2: Deuce]
And we once also had a story too
You can see that good men only come in few
Even in our greatest moments
We may win or we may lose
Every song's got its rules
You've got to learn to make it through
Maybe one day we can choose
How it feels to be a woman or a man
Without rules, but buried underneath
There's a picture glued
So when my body burns in ashes
Only sing the truth
Let these words strengthen all your views
Because these words were meant for you

[Chorus: Deuce]
These lies are leading me astray
It's too much for me to stay
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly
I see you, so please stay strong
I'll sing you one last song, and then I'm gone
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

[Bridge: Deuce]
And now I'm floating
Right above my coffin as it closes
I look down, I see Sigh
As she's crying on my mama's shoulder
I look up into the sky
As the gates of heaven open
Something's wrong
Is this destiny or am I going home?
What will happen to my soul?
Will I come back?
I don't know!
Will you meet me when it's over?
Let me know!
You can meet me here in heaven
Don't you ever let me go
This love this hate is burning me away!

[Chorus: Deuce]
These lies are leading me astray
It's too much for me to stay
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly
I see you, so please stay strong
I'll sing you one last song, and then I'm gone
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly
These lies are leading me astray
It's too much for me to stay
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly
I see you, so please stay strong
I'll sing you one last song, and then I'm gone
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

[Outro: Deuce]
This love, this hate is burning me away!
This love, this hate is burning me away!
