[Intro: Deuce]
They know I came to set it off
God let me know I can let it off
You see my cross? Yeah, it never falls
So you know it's on till the break of dawn

[Verse 1: The Truth]
Yeah, I make the green grow like I'm horse shit
And I'm one of a kind like Picasso's portrait
I'm killing rap, boys, and I'm going psycho
Riding through the night like my name was Michael
It's all gravy like I'm sitting on mash
I'm spending money like I'm swimming in cash
From grams to halves, zips to quarters
Guiding two birds like I'm fucking Larry Starters
I'm holding front, ain't you glad?
Got a problem? Pop off, only hoes get mad
The trey Five-seveN, don't let it catch you slip
Billy the Kid, boy, I'm on some cowboy shit
I'm a grown man, the whip ain't got rims
I'm from LA, homie, I don't rock Timbs
Pops had to go, so I grew up quick
Life is a bitch, looking back on this shit

[Chorus: Deuce]
We ride, we roll, and everybody here knows
That I kill these flows, they keep saying "oh no"
They know we for real, and that's for sure
When I grab the wheel, Truth's got the dough
We ride, we roll, and everybody here knows
That I kill these flows, they keep saying "oh no"
They know we for real, and that's for sure
When I grab the wheel, Truth's got the dough

[Verse 2: The Truth]
The Truth, motherfuckers, this is my summer
Watch me talk dirty like a nine hundred number
Fuck your girlfriend then throw away the rubber
This is your job, take a hold of her
Bitch, open your mouth, I'm Weston Dental
Your man ain't balling, that whip is a rental
I'm a born felon, I don't obey the law
I run this shit, Mr. Pepto Bismal
They on me, dawg, these fucking kids
Like a newborn on they mama's tits
Valet out the keys when I pull that whip up
Hit you for your chain if I catch you slip up
No, I can't stop like an ongoing hiccup
These fake motherfuckers I'm so sick of
They can try to run, but they can't hide
This ain't Raging Waters, I won't let 'em slide

[Chorus: Deuce]
We ride, we roll, and everybody here knows
That I kill these flows, they keep saying "oh no"
They know we for real, and that's for sure
When I grab the wheel, Truth's got the dough
We ride, we roll, and everybody here knows
That I kill these flows, they keep saying "oh no"
They know we for real, and that's for sure
When I grab the wheel, Truth's got the dough

[Verse 3: Deuce]
I speed write while I'm blindfolded and tongue-tied
They say I'm number one in the booth with no tries
I say I'm having fun 'cause my shit's got nine tiles
Platinum, win 'em all, and, yeah, Undead's got Nine Lives
City after city, yeah, my crew gets airtime
Witty, he's so witty, but he's right at the same time
He wants to roll me with like a seven dream fifty
God, I know you're with me; when I'm gone, I know they'll miss me
Grab the mic, I'm like a hero from the afterlife
Now it's time to show these people what my skills are like
You don't know what's been on my mind
Grab that loot and take what's mine
Trying to interview me, you're like, "What's your life like?
I seen you on K-ROQ like, 'Yo, that shit's tight'
Heard you on your page, I was like, 'Yo, that's Deuce, right?'
A million fucking plays now, it's on like game time"

[Chorus: Deuce]
We ride, we roll, and everybody here knows
That I kill these flows, they keep saying "oh no"
They know we for real, and that's for sure
When I grab the wheel, Truth's got the dough
We ride, we roll, and everybody here knows
That I kill these flows, they keep saying "oh no"
They know we for real, and that's for sure
When I grab the wheel, Truth's got the dough
