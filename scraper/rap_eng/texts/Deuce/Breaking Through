[Chorus]
Fight
Fight with me
We'll make it through
Through again
Now
Now I see
Where I'm gone
Gone to find my home

[Verse 1]
Lonely crawling through these dark walls
Finding hope if hope still exists
But I can see the things
You put me through I felt this way
I felt this way for so long
And all the pain I felt in this life gone in this...

[Chorus]
Fight
Fight with me
We'll make it through
Through again
Now
Now I see
Where I'm gone
Gone to find my home

[Verse 2]
Losing in this game of life now
I'd lost you before I felt so much pain
And now I wanna say goodbye
To all those times we fought
Those times you were by my side
I felt like this wasn't real
Like I was living in someone else's dream

[Chorus]
Fight
Fight with me
We'll make it through
Through again
Now
Now I see
Where I'm gone
Gone to find my home

[Bridge]
My home!
My home!
My home!
And I know that
You can't see the future because it's lost
And now I've seen it in the past
And I fear that
There's nothing left for me or left for you
Or left for God to live for
I won't give up on the future!

[Chorus]
Fight
Fight with me
We'll make it through
Through again
Now
Now I see
Where I'm gone
Gone to find...
Fight
Fight with me
We'll make it through
Through again
Now
Now I see
Where I'm gone
Gone to find my home

[Outro]
But I can see the things
You put me through I felt this way
I felt this way for so long
And all the pain I felt in this life gone in this...
I can see the things
You put me through I felt this way
I felt this way for so long
And all the pain I felt in this life gone in this...
