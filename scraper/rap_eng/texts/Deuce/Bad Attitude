[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Oh, come on

[Verse 1]
R.I.P. blood is all I see
I'm bringing death to these motherfuckers, all I need
Is the Good Book, ain't going on my knees
Take a good look, I know it's what you wanna be
Yeah, I started this gangsta shit, it's how you thank me?
Like you were the ones who made me?
Five years later, got the plaque hanging
Still in the back of the lab, screaming, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Hail Mary, hail motherfucking Deuce, what?
Living large, fancy cars, sipping Goose, I
Don't give a fuck, don't care what you do, as
Long as I'm me, I'll win, and you'll lose bitch

[Chorus]
I would never die for you, live a lie for you!
I will never cry for you, it's a little too late to
What am I to do? I hate you too
I got a bad attitude!
I would never die for you, write a rhyme for you
Wouldn't even try for you, it's a little too late to
What am I to do? I hate you too
I got a bad attitude

[Verse 2]
Yeah, ashes to ashes, dust to dust
You can try to hide but you can't run
Yeah, I got you bitches right under the gun
I'll leave you six feet under, son
I'll shoot you motherfuckers right in the face
So you better get used to how the bullets taste
Make your bitch ass stay gone erased
Just another dead body left to trace

[Pre-Chorus]
Hail Mary, hail motherfucking Deuce, what?
Living large, fancy cars, sipping Goose, I
Don't give a fuck, don't care what you do, as
Long as I'm me, I'll win, and you'll lose bitch

[Chorus]
I would never die for you, live a lie for you
I will never cry for you, it's a little too late to
What am I to do? I hate you too
I got a bad attitude
I would never die for you, write a rhyme for you!
Wouldn't even try for you, it's a little too late to
What am I to do? I hate you too
I got a bad attitude

[Verse 3]
I know you hate me and it's driving you crazy!
Made a mistake, you thought that I wasn't mainstream!
I'll take on the world and all the problems I'm facing!
Destined to great things, I'm fucking amazing!
I won't slow down, I can't be stopped
I'll be looking down at you from the top
'Cause I've come this far, I won't give up
I'm a bad motherfucker, I won't give up!

[Chorus]
I would never die for you, live a lie for you
I will never cry for you, it's a little too late to
What am I to do? I hate you too
I got a bad attitude

[Chorus]
I would never die for you, live a lie for you
I will never cry for you, it's a little too late to
What am I to do? I hate you too
I got a bad attitude
I would never die for you, write a rhyme for you
Wouldn't even try for you, it's a little too late to
What am I to do? I hate you too
I got a bad attitude

[Outro]
C'mon
Bad attitude
Bad attitude
