[Intro]
It's alright, yeah, it's okay
Keep saying my name, you won't put me to shame
Say what you say, but you got nothing on me
Two could play this game, but I ain't going away

[Verse 1]
You can keep on talking
But homie, I am not stopping
You wanna give me your problems?
I ain't gonna be the one to solve 'em
Just because you're jobless
Don't mean I gotta be your target
I keep the whole crowd bobbing
While you're gonna be forgotten
We have nothing in common
You're falling out the bottom
This is life, not stardom
You better be ready, I'm coming

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, it's just too late
Whoa, to get rid of me
Whoa, I'm not going away
No more apologies

[Chorus]
It's alright, yeah, it's okay
Keep saying my name, you won't put me to shame
Say what you say, but you got nothing on me
Two could play this game, but I ain't going away
Yeah, it's alright, yeah, it's okay
I'm the one you blame 'cause you're fucking insane
Say what you say, but you got nothing on me
Two could play this game, but I ain't going away

[Verse 2]
Whatever you been popping
Is gonna outline you in chalk, bitch
You make me so damn nauseous
I wanna just puke on your coffin
You'll be Philip Hoffman
Choking on your own vomit
While these kids keep on moshing
To the hate that I'm causing
I'm gonna be your problem
Like me with no condom
You ain't got no options
I'm coming out swinging like thunder

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, it's just too late
Whoa, to get rid of me
Whoa, I'm not going away
No more apologies

[Chorus]
It's alright, yeah, it's okay
Keep saying my name, you won't put me to shame
Say what you say, but you got nothing on me
Two could play this game, but I ain't going away
Yeah, it's alright, yeah, it's okay
I'm the one you blame 'cause you're fucking insane
Say what you say, but you got nothing on me
Two could play this game, but I ain't going away

[Bridge]
I can do this on my own
Break the fucking status quo
Easy come and easy go
Welcome to the Big Deuce Show
Just like presto
Poof, you're a zero
Back in the ghetto
Another shadow!

[Chorus]
It's alright, yeah, it's okay
Keep saying my name, you won't put me to shame
Say what you say, but you got nothing on me
Two could play this game, but I ain't going away
Yeah, it's alright, yeah, it's okay
I'm the one you blame 'cause you're fucking insane
Say what you say, but you got nothing on me
Two could play this game, but I ain't going away

[Outro]
It's alright, yeah, it's okay
I'm not going away
It's alright, it's okay
No apologies
I can do this on my own
Break the fucking status quo
Easy come and easy go
Welcome to the Big Deuce Show
