[Intro]
Far away!
Far away!

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me how you feel all alone
And how I can't be there for you now
When I say, I'm gone now
When I fall from this time, I can see

[Chorus]
I see the life was over now
See the things I've always missed
Now I wanna say goodbye
But you could only see me drown so far
Could only see me die this way
So now I'm running far away
Far away!
Far away!

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me how I've lost what's inside
And all these dreams I've woke up to this
This nightmare, I can't fight, can't see light
Is this heaven or hell?

[Chorus]
See the life was over now
See the things I've always missed
Now I wanna say goodbye
But you could only see me drown so far
Could only see me die this way
So now I'm running far away
Far away

[Brige]
I can't find the words to say
Still don't believe in faith
Still feels like I'm late
I need you
Take me through this now
We'll go and find another place
Where we can still be safe
Where I can still be sane

[Chorus]
See the life was over now
See the things I've always missed
Now I wanna say goodbye
But you could only see me drown so far
Could only see me die this way
So now I'm running far away
Far away!
See the life was over now
See the things I've always missed
Now I wanna say goodbye
But you could only see me drown so far
Could only see me die this way
So now I'm running far away
Far away!
Far away!
Far away!
Far away!
Far away!
