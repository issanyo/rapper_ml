[Intro: Deuce]
Nine Lives
Deuce, let's go

[Chorus]
I'm supposed to be the one that brings us all together weak or strong
Not just a song we sing along when things go wrong
You will need me when you fall, and I will need you when I'm wrong
Tears lead me on, they let me lead you so far weak or strong, I'll hold your arm

[Verse 1]
I see the sickness in the signs, the dead weight in line
Like the sickness in my mind, homosexuals, and liars
Fuck praying for reasons, fuck praying for Jesus
Let me shine like a god, like a leader
I'll burn a hole through your cross, my soul's already lost
And it's funny 'cause they're saying "he's hot"
But they don't see the fucking tears that I've cried
And they don't hear me when I scream when I die
I wanna live good, I wanna live right
My insecurities are eating me alive
I need to find someone close to my heart
That'll help me through my struggles, you can help me through my songs

[Chorus]
I'm supposed to be the one that brings us all together weak or strong
Not just a song we sing along when things go wrong
You will need me when you fall, and I will need you when I'm wrong
Tears lead me on, they let me lead you so far weak or strong, I'll hold your arm

[Verse 2]
I already found the devil, he's my best friend
He taught me how to leave, but I don't wanna end
I'd want a pill for every bad thought
For every chick I've fucked, for every time I lost
Don't think I'm broken 'cause I'm not
Got milk? Got problems? Problems is all that I got
You're looking down on a barrel of a bent pole
Take my hand, I promise that I'll go slow
When you look too close, you end up with a broke soul
'Cause in the end, it's dark where all the souls go
Maybe you can show me how to live right
And come see how it all ends, I'm...

[Chorus]
I'm supposed to be the one that brings us all together weak or strong
Not just a song we sing along when things go wrong
You will need me when you fall, and I will need you when I'm wrong
Tears lead me on, they let me lead you so far weak or strong, I'll hold your arm

[Bridge]
I'll take you to a place so warm
Like the insides of a baby, unborn
The Bible keeps telling me "don't go"
They don't know what I know, what?
You will reap what I sow, what?
You will cease when I blow, yup
I won't leave when you go, nope
Come with me, let us go home

[Chorus]
I'm supposed to be the one that brings us all together weak or strong
Not just a song we sing along when things go wrong
You will need me when you fall and I will need you when I'm wrong
Tears lead me on, they let me lead you so far weak or strong, I'll hold your arm
