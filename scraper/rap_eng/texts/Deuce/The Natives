[Intro: Deuce]
Seems like everyone's got their beef
But tomorrow we'll be shining brighter
We'll keep it going, fighting
Hold on when we win, take a hit
'Cause we never gonna lose it dying
We gonna keep on fighting
Hold on when we win, take a hit
'Cause we never gonna lose it dying
We gonna keep on fighting

[Chorus: Deuce & Funny Man]
And all the days come back to me
Come back to what we used to be
And in the end, we'll find the rest
The rest has gone away
And yesterday, we used to say
We'd never change and stay the same
And in the end, we'll find the rest
The rest has gone away

[Verse 1: Charlie Scene & Deuce]
It gets harder to see what people want me to be
It's just me being me, I'm just Charlie Scene
I used to follow my dream to play guitar and sing
Now, I rhyme over beats, I take it seriously
I used to flow with Gs, it was a joke to me
And I would never foresee that I would be an emcee
When I would skate the streets, I had a fake ID
And I carved my name on a tree back when it was JT
And now Undead will get props for the rest of our lives
And that's like getting a permanent high-five
'Cause people like our tight rhymes, and haters get a black eye
From six crazy white guys
I'm just a guy in a band with a mic in my hand
Who decided to rap and fell in love with his fans
And now my flows are the sickest, rated ten by the bitches
And I'm getting ridiculous, that's how many inches my dick is

[Refrain: Deuce]
Undead revolution!
One, two, three, go!

[Chorus: Deuce & Funny Man]
And all the days come back to me
Come back to what we used to be
And in the end, we'll find the rest
The rest has gone away
And yesterday, we used to say
We'd never change and stay the same
And in the end, we'll find the rest
The rest has gone away

[Verse 2: J-Dog & Da Kurlzz]
I got my name up on a wall with JOR
I got arrested with Wes and the Scientist
I used to run with a gang, my parents sent me away
Produca showed me how to phrase, I like it better this way
Now, watch me fuck up this beat with J-D-O-G
Johnny, J-Dog, and me, we fuck fifty girls a week
I used to skate on the streets and always people would beef
And they'd pull guns out on meâ€”oh wait, that happened last week
I'm used to dancing at shows, handing out the blows
You see me and Charlie Scene tag-teaming the hoes
And our armor shines gold, got no albums sold
It's just me and Da Kurlzz, we're taking over the world
And 3 Tears got a mind like a Caesar
He writes lyrics, eats grapes, and f-fucks at his own leisure
And the Funny Man ain't African, he's Mexican
Hard-headed like Republicans, Undead revolution!

[Refrain: Deuce]
Undead revolution!
One, two, three, go!

[Chorus: Deuce & Funny Man]
And all the days come back to me (come back to me)
Come back to what we used to be (come back to what we used to be)
And in the end, we'll find the rest
The rest has gone away
And yesterday, we used to say (and yesterday)
We'd never change and stay the same (we'd never change, we'd never change)
And in the end, we'll find the rest
The rest has gone away

[Outro: Deuce & Johnny 3 Tears]
The rest is gone away, oh
We've got nothing in this world
Except for you boys and you girls
And we'll kill to the top
And we'll laugh as they watch
The rest is gone away, oh
We've got nothing in this world
Except for you boys and you girls
And we'll kill to the top
And we'll laugh as they watch
