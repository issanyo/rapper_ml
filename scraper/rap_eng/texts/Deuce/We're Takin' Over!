Taking over this shit like a spaceship
Shut it down, move bitch like off switch
Tell yo' hoes they are so basic
I'm the name on everybody's lips

Damn yo, that's sick
If you wanna live then get out the way
I'm living this bitch like real estate
We're taking over this fucking place

Break free; breaking out tonight
Killing everything but the lights
Destroying everything in our sight
I'm fucking free tonight

Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over
Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over

Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over
Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over

We're takin' over
We're takin' over

On point like a bullseye like motherfucker
I defeated this blunt, I'ma need another
Don't fuck around, let no circle drip
I don't mess with no bitch that don't twerk

We be like bye Felicia, pleased to meet ya
Sorry that you outta work
Take over, take cover
Flip the switch, bitch get fucking drunk

Break free; breaking out tonight
Killing everything but the lights
Destroying everything in our sight
I'm fucking free tonight

Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over
Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over

Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over
Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over

We're takin' we're takin'
We're takin' over
We're takin' we're takin'
We're takin' over

Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over
Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over

Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over
Woah oh oh oh
We're takin' over

We're takin' we're takin'
We're takin' over
We're takin' we're takin'
We're takin' over
