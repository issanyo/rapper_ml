[Intro: Truth]
Aye, yo, Deuce
You hear about this fuckboy Danny?
Fucking American Idol reject, haha
Fucking faggots

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce]
That's when we, that's when we, that's when we ride
That's when we, that's when we ride on these bitches
That's when we, that's when we, that's when we ride
That's when we, that's when we ride on these bitches

[Chorus: Deuce]
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches

[Verse 1: Gadjet]
Yo, Hollywood Who? Without my dawg Deuce?
Don't make me have to rhyme, man, the boy got juice
In or outside, this ain't only in the booth
Somebody gotta die, they gon' wish they called truce
Kinda Major on the track, got Truth
Gadjet got the facts if you faggots want proof
Might as well hang it up now, no noose
I'm fucking everybody, leave your pussies out loose
Tie 'em up, and I'll throw 'em in the trunk
Fuckers wanted war and I'mma give 'em what they want
Bend they ass over, I'mma treat 'em like a punk
Prison break that ass off, go till I bust a nut
I don't give a fuck, never have, never will
Go try and find a better rapper with some better skill
I murder motherfuckers, I massacre for the thrill
Itching for some fucking killing and blood is my Benadryl

[Chorus: Deuce]
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches

[Verse 2: Deuce]
Look, now you've got to admit
No one likes your pussy music
It's sad you sold out but didn't sell shit
You fucking idiots, lip sync fags, Milli Vanilli, bitch
How the fuck do you call yourself a band? You can barely rap
It's on now, what comes up must come down
When this shit flies, they won't be around
Saying I couldn't spit was their biggest mistake
Now Undead sucks, they're a bunch of fakes
Johnny's getting overweight, he's too fat to be calling names
Let's play a game, Everyone's Listening
When I say "fuck," sing along and say "fuck HU"
"Fuck HU"
When I say "what's my name," you call me Big Deuce
What's my name? "Big Deuce"

[Chorus: Deuce]
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches

[Verse 3: Truth]
It's what it is, I'm best in the biz
Black ski mask and the cig
Two clips, two sips off of that Rosay
Hit my man Jose with the coke weight
OC, hit a bump of that cree cree
HU be softer than the sea breeze
Fuck you, we be nuttier than a Reese's
And we see more dough, move more blow
Deuce gone solo, dropped y'all homos
So fly, out come the parachute
I'm always first to peel, never scared to shoot
The Truth, you know I'm out for the loot
Headed to the top, we moving through the roof
Shorty got her top down just like the Coupe
Fuck you, this is Nine Lives
Real life, my ties, one slip and you all die

[Chorus: Deuce]
That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches

[Bridge: Deuce]
What? Say "what the fuck?"
Six shooters up
Now, what the fuck?
Point them up

[Verse 4: Doebeezi of GML]
I'mma snatch your mask off and tell it like it is
No more talent, no more showbiz
Deuce left the band, and now y'all a bunch of jokes
Hollywood is Dead, and that's all she fucking wrote
Leave you dead in a ditch, yes, heard you were snitches
Nine Lives, that's how we ride on you bitches
Yeah, I said it, it's Doe-boy from GML
If you get hurt feelings, oh well
Do something, you couldn't fade me on your best day
The Wiz Kid's gone, that's why you get less pay
Still, remember when your first album dropped
Skipped it to the chorus, the rest of y'all flopped
Wack-ass lyrics, I mean garbage
Leaky like a faucet, your whole entourage
Wish on a star? Bitch, you'll never make a million
Nine Lives and GML in the building

[Outro: Deuce]
That's when we, that's when we, that's when we ride
That's when we, that's when we ride on these bitches
That's when we, that's when we, that's when we ride
That's when we, that's when we ride on these bitches
