[Intro: Deuce]
Release the cracking!
All the girlies with the pretty, little panties
Turn around, let me smack both them ass cheeks
Throw your cups if you're getting nasty
Whoa
Ooh damn, girl, you're looking real fancy
Girl, come on Deuce's lap, I got free candy
Throw your cups up, we're gonna get nasty
I know how to make you happy

[Chorus: Deuce]
Let's get it cracking, bottles, we back in
Town, we're so plastered, so meet in the bathroom
She just turned eighteen, she calls me baby
Yeah, she's been waiting all night to rape me
Let's get it cracking bottles, we back in
Town, we so plastered, so meeting in the bathroom
She just turned eighteen, she calls me baby
Yeah, she's been waiting all night to rape me

[Verse 1: Deuce]
Here I come, rubbing on your girl's clit and under-bum
Oops, look what I found, a nice little Wonder Bra
She must be young 'cause I can barely get under 'em
Lips between the hips, so I just keep on rubbing 'em
Poke a hole in her butt while I'm sucking them titties, yeah, it's fun
'Cause I can do all three at once
Bust a nut, let it drip, drip from her tongue
Slut, I just gave you anal and you still licked it up!
It's time to find me some more girlies in the club
I like 'em black, I like 'em white, I like 'em young
I like 'em tall, I like 'em short if they got junk
She's got an ass that goes like a dump truck
I know she wants to take me home
She's calling her friends like, "Oh
I got Deuce with me, girl, so bring a bottle of rum
And some condoms 'cause we gon' have a threesome"

[Chorus: Deuce]
Let's get it cracking, bottles, we back in
Town, we're so plastered, so meet in the bathroom
She just turned eighteen, she calls me baby
Yeah, she's been waiting all night to rape me
Let's get it cracking bottles, we back in
Town, we so plastered, so meeting in the bathroom
She just turned eighteen, she calls me baby
Yeah, she's been waiting all night to rape me

[Verse 2: Jeffree Star]
Pink swag, glitter gun, high heels, here I come
Make-up on, in the club, fucked your mom just for fun
I'm so wet, make you wild, make you wanna pull it out
Oh wow, on my knees, can't breathe, suck it down
I want to smear it all around
Cum-queen, bitch, I wear the crown
Stuff me up, baby, make me drown
Bare-backing, it's a touchdown
Smacking fags is what I do, you wanna be me? Huh, what's new?
Spit or lube? You better choose, "bitch, what's a condom?", no excuse
My vagina is a petting zoo, only let in ten-inch dudes
Just got raped by Drake, baby, why'd you fuck up my hairdo?
It's J-E-F-F-R-E-E Star
I play you boys like a fucking guitar
Lick my ass and my surgery scars
I always smash midgets and fucking retards

[Chorus: Deuce]
Let's get it cracking, bottles, we back in
Town, we're so plastered, so meet in the bathroom
She just turned eighteen, she calls me baby
Yeah, she's been waiting all night to rape me
Let's get it cracking bottles, we back in
Town, we so plastered, so meeting in the bathroom
She just turned eighteen, she calls me baby
Yeah, she's been waiting all night to rape me

[Bridge: Deuce]
Don't be afraid of me, girl
Just bend back, let me rock your whole world
Tonight's gonna be one big blur
Party in Room Three-Oh-Third
Titties jiggling up in herre
We getting freaky, that's for sure
Drinking that ice cold burr
I was born to rock this world

[Bridge: Deuce]
Go, this place is turning to a festival
Go, circus transsexuals
Go, extraterrestrials
Go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Go, this place is turning to a festival
Go, circus transsexuals
Go, twirling like a carousel
Go, let's go, let's go, let's go

[Chorus: Deuce]
Let's get it cracking, bottles, we back in
Town, we're so plastered, so meet in the bathroom
She just turned eighteen, she calls me baby
Yeah, she's been waiting all night to rape me
Let's get it cracking bottles, we back in
Town, we so plastered, so meeting in the bathroom
She just turned eighteen, she calls me baby
Yeah, she's been waiting all night to rape me

[Outro: Deuce]
All the girlies with the pretty, little panties
Turn around, let me smack both them ass cheeks
Throw your cups up if you're getting nasty
Whoa
Ooh damn, girl, you're looking real fancy
Girl, come on Deuce's lap, I got free candy
Throw your cups up, we're gonna get nasty
Whoa, oh fuck
