[Chorus: Deuce]
Now I can see your pain, I'm sorry
Goodbye, I cry so...
Now I can see your pain, I'm sorry
Goodbye, I cry tonight

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
The next of this youth with their necks through this noose
Were told lies like it's truth, and we suspect that it's you
So you strap 'em with the AK, it's motherfucking may day
They swear I'm fucking crazy, ain't nothing gonna save me
I'm breaking, I feel it, I'm naked, I'm kneeling
I'm shaking, I'm reeling, my God, I keep bleeding
I watch the world die through crimson eyes, I cry, it turns to night
I die, I see the light, and now I'll say goodbye

[Chorus: Da Kurlzz & Deuce]
Now I can see your pain, I'm sorry
Goodbye, I cry so...
Now I can see your pain, I'm sorry
Goodbye, I cry tonight

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
If I could take all this pain away, use the rage of our youth today
Who's to say that it's you to blame?
It's the people above you, the ones who say that they love you
Look what the world has come to, so now it's time to say "fuck you"
But if you care, then they drug you, and no one's there when they numb you
Fill you with terror and crush you, pretend they care as they shove you
So you look to me to find the truth, and what I say is what you do
But everyone you look up to is really as fucked up as you
Time is getting shorter with these enforced disorders
And we get blamed and pushed around, so who's the fucking villain now?

[Chorus: Da Kurlzz & Deuce]
Now I can see your pain, I'm sorry
Goodbye, I cry so...
Now I can see your pain, I'm sorry
Goodbye, I cry tonight

[Bridge: Charlie Scene, Da Kurlzz & Deuce]
We can't stop now, we're so close now
'Cause these times are almost over
I won't give up, so God save us
It feels like we're getting closer
We can't stop now, we're so close now
'Cause these times are almost over
I won't give up, so God save us, whoa...

[Chorus: Da Kurlzz & Deuce]
Now I can see your pain, I'm sorry
Goodbye, I cry so...
Now I can see your pain, I'm sorry
Goodbye, I cry tonight

[Outro: Da Kurlzz & Deuce]
Goodbye, I cry tonight
I'll cry tonight, goodbye, I cried tonight
