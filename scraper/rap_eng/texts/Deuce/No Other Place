[Intro: Deuce]
Oh, shake it, baby
Funny Man, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Los Angeles, Undead, let's go

[Chorus: Deuce]
'Cause there's no other place that I'd rather be
Than Los Angeles, come on, shake it, baby
Come on, grab a drink, I wanna see you hit the floor
You got a fat ass, but you shake it like you ain't a hoe
There's no other place that I'd rather be
Than Los Angeles, come on, shake it, baby
Come on, grab a drink, I wanna see you hit the floor
You got a fat ass, but you shake it like you ain't a hoe

[Verse 1: Funny Man]
Yo, who that, who that knocking on the window?
It's Funny, J-Dog, smoking up the indo
Windows down, you know the system's banging
Hollywood Undead, I ain't playing
Cruising downtown with a bottle beside me
Looking so fly, I got bitches behind me
Yo, I'm in the studio making something to dance to
'Cause these bitches wanna hear something they can shake their ass to
Yeah, up in LA, represent Hollywood
Westside till I die, motherfucker, what's good?
So what's good with that when this song's a rap?
Deuce in the studio, got bitches in the back
Smoked out backseat, dipping in the taxi
So what you gonna do when I knock you out, fool?
You know we keep it the same, you know Undead is the name
Say what you say, it's okay, we ain't never gonna change

[Chorus: Deuce]
'Cause there's no other place that I'd rather be
Than Los Angeles, come on, shake it baby
Come on, grab a drink, I wanna see you hit the floor
You got a fat ass, but you shake it like you ain't a hoe
There's no other place that I'd rather be
Than Los Angeles, come on, shake it baby
Come on, grab a drink, I wanna see you hit the floor
You got a fat ass, but you shake it like you ain't a hoe

[Bridge: Funny Man]
Everybody in the club, shake it up
LA, let me see you shake it up
Hollywood, let me see you shake it up
Everybody, shake it up, come on, shake it, baby

[Verse 2: Funny Man]
I ain't fucking around 'cause King Kong is down
Cristal, shake it up, we all over this town
So let's cruise to the boulevard, into the Beauty Bar
And let me see you work that ass, come on and shake it fast
Two whiskey hits, JLo's giving shots in the back, so where my boys at?
There goes Johnny 3 cruising in the Cadillac '63
No dubs, and that's a fact
When you see me on the scene: black shirt, black jeans
Tattoos, white shoes, running thirty-deep, fool
In the city of LA where it's just another day
Shooting craps with the Phantom, dude think he's getting paid
We ain't here to front, we ain't here to beef
We're just here to get you out your motherfucking seat
And you don't really wanna step to this
Funny Man, Undead, and we rock it like what?

[Chorus: Deuce]
'Cause there's no other place that I'd rather be
Than Los Angeles, come on, shake it baby
Come on, grab a drink, I wanna see you hit the floor
You got a fat ass, but you shake it like you ain't a hoe
There's no other place that I'd rather be
Than Los Angeles, come on, shake it baby
Come on, grab a drink, I wanna see you hit the floor
You got a fat ass, but you shake it like you ain't a hoe

[Outro: Funny Man]
Haha, oh shit! What's really going on, baby?
What's happening, playboy? You know who this is!
Funny Man, aka King Kong, yo!
Oh! Yo, Dave! Diggity Dave! Fuck you, bitch!
You got your face pimped! Holler!
Oh wait, gotta go! Charlie's hitting me up!
Peace, bitch!
