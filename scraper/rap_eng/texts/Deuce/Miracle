[Verse 1]
I don't need no psychologist
Trying to figure out why I got these fucking problems
I'm a motherfucking anarchist
And ain't nobody ever gonna be able to solve 'em
I don't care what you wanna call 'em
It's too late to fix me, I'm at Rock Bottom
I'd rather blow my brains with this shotgun
Than sit there listening to your fucking nonsense
I guess that's all you offer
So why do I even bother?
I don't need all you doctors
To make me feel like a million dollars

[Pre-Chorus]
Instead of trying to escape
Or just looking the other way
I will learn from my mistakes
Learn to communicate

[Chorus]
I need to find the way, I need a miracle
I need to know if I'm all alone in this world
I need to heal these wounds deep down inside my soul
I need to know where this path will go for me tomorrow

[Verse 2]
You say that you're on edge
Because you pop a couple Xannies with some random loser friends?
Say I'm a bum but you're homeless yourself
The biggest loser of 'em all, living in that flesh
I don't care how low you hang down your belt
If your poetry's deep, homie, it ain't heartfelt
I don't care if you've had it up to here
I'm gonna kick your ass, make it nice and clear
You wanna talk blood, sweat, and tears!
When you act and look like Old Saint Claire
You wanna act tough like "you're shit, don't sing"
But when you're hurt, it's always like your heart sinks

[Pre-Chorus]
Instead of trying to escape
Or just looking the other way
I will learn from my mistakes
Learn to communicate

[Chorus]
I need to find the way, I need a miracle
I need to know if I'm all alone in this world
I need to heal these wounds deep down inside my soul
I need to know where this path will go for me tomorrow!

[Bridge]
No more sorrow!
No pill to swallow!
As millions follow!
I will not sell my soul!

[Verse 3]
You wanna place us all in the same boat?
Thank God I got a mind of my own
I might be crazy holding on to this rope
Fucking you up like Geronimo
This birdie's still safely in his zone
Floating all around like a fucking ghost
Don't really care how I'm diagnosed
This song is when the bomb drops, it pretty much goes

[Chorus]
I need to find the way, I need a miracle
I need to know if I'm all alone in this world
I need to heal these wounds deep down inside my soul
I need to know where this path will go for me tomorrow
I need to find the way, I need a miracle
I need to know if I'm all alone in this world
I need to heal these wounds deep down inside my soul
I need to know where this path will go for me tomorrow
