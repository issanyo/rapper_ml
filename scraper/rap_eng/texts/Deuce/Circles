[Intro]
Take my hand, let's go
Somewhere we can rest our souls
We'll sit where it's warm
You say: "Look we're here alone"

[Chorus]
I was running in circles
I hurt myself just to find my purpose
Everything was so worthless, I didn't deserve this
But to me you were perfect

[Verse 1]
I'm scattered through this life
If this is life, I'll say goodbye
She's gone like an angel
With wings, let me burn tonight

[Chorus]
I was running in circles
I hurt myself just to find my purpose
Everything was so worthless, I didn't deserve this
But to me you were perfect

[Verse 3]
Now watch my wounds, they turn to dust
Watch me heal so I can love
I need to breathe so I can touch
Touch the waters in the ocean
When I breathe, it's like a rush
I can finally feel the trust
I can finally lead my lust
It's like I bleed but I don't bust
So hold my hand, see the sky
See the waters, see the sun
If it's cold, I'll keep you warm
There's no need, then go back home
It's just me, it's just you
Now we're free, we're all alone
Every problem has its hope
And I promise I can fix 'em on my own

[Chorus]
I was running in circles
I hurt myself just to find my purpose
Everything was so worthless, I didn't deserve this
But to me you were perfect
I was running in circles
I hurt myself just to find my purpose
Everything was so worthless, I didn't deserve this
But to me you were perfect

[Outro]
I've gone away, seen better times than yesterday
It's hard to say that everything will be okay
I've gone away, seen better times than yesterday
It's hard to say that everything will be okay
