How long has this been going on?

Well, if friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicions
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem

And you said you was never intending
To break up our scene this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day

To break up our scene this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
