[Intro: Deuce]
Bitches I hope you know
Bitches I hope you know

[Chorus: Deuce]
Bitches I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that, hoe
Baby come say hello
And get your drunk ass over here, let's bone
Bitches I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that, hoe
Shorty come say hello
And get your drunk ass over here, let's bone

[Verse 1: Funny Man & Charlie Scene]
Yo, I'm up in the club and the party's jumping
Bitches passing by and they're eyeball-fucking
I'm drinking Cristal, now they're trying to kiss me
Saying "Funny Man, can you sign my titties?"
Now I got four bitches in the back of my Rover
The fantastic four are saying "Funny, can I blow you?"
Three were preppy and one was scene
So three for me and one for Charlie
This girl's seventeen now I'm a pedophile
Now she's showing me her tits, I think this girl's gone wild
I whipped out my dick, and her jaw hit the floor
Acting like she never seen a magnum before
Turn off the lights and now I'm gonna film it
Turn on the night-vision like she's Paris Hilton
Funny Man walked in and said "chupa mi pito"
Then she munched on his dick like a macho burrito
Fuck yeah

[Chorus: Deuce]
Bitches I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that, hoe
Baby come say hello
And get your drunk ass over here, let's bone
Bitches I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that, hoe
Shorty come say hello
And get your drunk ass over here, let's bone

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears & J-Dog]
Now I'm Cadillaxing, candle waxing
I like your fat ass, bitch, grab my jacket
And grab a taxi, get in the backseat
Fuck, suck dick, lick, man we nasty
Drive fast please 'cause this booze is not lasting
One too many shots and I seem to be passing
I think this chick is down, yeah, she's down for the threesome
I call the homie J just to see if he needs some
J-J-J-Just got back coming from the bar
Rubbing on this chickie's titties in the back of her car
B-But your first mistake, you said you liked my band
The second one's you put my Undead dick in your hand
And I'm taking secret pics on my cellular phone
I got my fingers in places where they don't belong
Horny as fuck, pressing my luck
Need my dick sucked so bitch give it up!

[Chorus: Deuce]
Bitches I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that, hoe
Baby come say hello
And get your drunk ass over here, let's bone
Bitches I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that hoe
Shorty come say hello
And get your drunk ass over here, let's bone

[Bridge: Deuce]
Let's both get faded 'cause you know that I want you
Let's both get naked, girl, you know that you want to
Baby, we can have a party tonight, I wanna hit it cause I know that it's tight
Baby, we can have a party tonight, I wanna hit it all night, all night, all night, all night

[Chorus: Deuce]
Bitches I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that, hoe
Baby come say hello
And get your drunk ass over here, let's bone
Bitches I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that, hoe
Shorty come say hello
And get your drunk ass over here
Don't stop yet, I'm almost there
Get your drunk ass over here, let's bone
