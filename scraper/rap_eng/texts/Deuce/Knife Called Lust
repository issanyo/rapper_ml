[Intro: Shady Jeff]
Let's go right now!

[Verse 1: J-Dog]
I look alive, I'm dead inside
My heart has holes and black blood flows
We'll do some drugs, we'll fall in love
And get fucked up while the world just shrugs
With no thought logically
We're wandering the streets so aimlessly
I hate to see these kids just being
Put down so painlessly
And people say you dye your hair and wear tight jeans
That doesn't mean that you can't scream
And like loud noise
You got a choice, you have a voice
And just because you show no love
And hate on us, you fucked our trust
Now watch we thrust this knife called lust
Into my chest until it bursts

[Chorus: Deuce]
This love, this hate is burning me away
It's hard to face that we're all the same
This love, this hate is burning me away
It's harder times like these that never change.

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
I'm mad at the fact your dad is an addict
Your friend takes pills, he thinks it cures sadness
I'm not here to attack and make you kids panic
But it's just tragic the way you kids have it
Everybody sins and it all begins
It goes back around, nobody ever wins
And you stab yourself in the back
Everybody, just relax
It all just hits so close to home
We all got friends but we stand alone
And you're on your own from a broken home
You keep the truth inside and it stays unknown
Nostalgia hits then it's time to quit
And everybody acts like it don't mean shit
And your friend will stab you just to fuck some girl
Put your hands in the air and scream "fuck the world!"

[Chorus: Deuce]
This love, this hate is burning me away
It's hard to face that we're all the same
This love, this hate is burning me away
It's harder times like these that never change

[Bridge: Shady Jeff & Deuce]
Let go!
I'll bring you closer
Right now!
I'll hold on tightly
Let go!
We're going nowhere
Somewhere!
If things aren't over
Harder times like these!
Crawling up on the streets
Harder times like these!
I'll put you back on your feet

[Chorus: Deuce]
This love, this hate is burning me away
It's hard to face that we're all the same
This love, this hate is burning me away
It's harder times like these that never change

[Outro: Deuce & Charlie Scene & Shady Jeff]
This love, this hate is burning me away
And I fall to the ground with my teardrops
And I get lost every time my heart stops
This love this hate is burning me away
And I fall to the ground with my teardrops
And I get lost every time my heart stops
This love, this hate is burning me away!
