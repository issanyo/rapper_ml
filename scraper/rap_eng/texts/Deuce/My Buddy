[Intro]
Give me that fame, give me that money
Got no shame for these dummies
Give me that fame, give me that money
It's my game, don't act funny

[Chorus]
Give me that fame, give me that money
I got no shame for these dummies
Out of my way, you ain't my buddy
You sure as hell ain't gonna get lucky
Give me that fame, give me that money
This my game, don't act funny
Call me insane, that's right, buddy
It's raining now, it's gonna get muddy

[Verse 1]
It's payback for shit you pulled way back
Playback to when I got played, man
I saved that just to keep the pain painless
Now my middle finger's up in the air while I raise that
Shit's changing like a fucking rude awaken
No more playing, no more undertaking
Can you hear the articulation?
Are these words getting through to you inside of your head, maybe?
Fee-fi-fo-fum, dum-diddy-dum
How many dumb motherfuckers wanna get some?
You can't take these from under my thumb
This rap game ain't leaving till I'm outdone
Run, run, you don't want none, punk
Jump, jump when I'm right out front
P-Pop that trunk, what? Here I come, duck
Better check yourself 'fore you come up here, chump

[Pre-Chorus]
It's one for the haters all across the globe
Two for the labels trying to stop the show
Three for the homies trying to take the throne
Get ready, set, let's go

[Chorus]
Give me that fame, give me that money
I got no shame for these dummies
Out of my way, you ain't my buddy
You sure as hell ain't gonna get lucky
Give me that fame, give me that money
This my game, don't act funny
Call me insane, that's right, buddy
It's raining now, it's gonna get muddy

[Verse 2]
Oh no, look who's 'bout to go loco
No more being scared of these bozos
Told you that I'm all about mo' dough
Popos even bump my shit, so don't
Yo bro, give a fuck about your hoes
Show no fear just so you don't know
Row-row-row your boat, don't go slow
I'm so close, square as dojos
Born and raised, right in Soco
With some crazy-ass motherfucking mofos
Get up off my fucking shoulders
I'm spitting that, shit, ain't nobody gon' hold me
Folgers in the morning with all my soldiers?
I ain't even got to, I told you
You can't so hold on
Bring all of them faggot-ass foes on

[Pre-Chorus]
It's one for the haters all across the globe
Two for the labels trying to stop the show
Three for the homies trying to take the throne
Get ready, set, let's go

[Chorus]
Give me that fame, give me that money
I got no shame for these dummies
Out of my way, you ain't my buddy
You sure as hell ain't gonna get lucky
Give me that fame, give me that money
This my game, don't act funny
Call me insane, that's right, buddy
It's raining now, it's gonna get muddy

[Bridge]
Watch me while they all say "OMG"
In the Black Vic, bumping that MP3
I'm not a criminal, just the one behind the seat
Arrested just for flowing on the beat
Look what these people made me out to be
They don't know what it's like to be me
Go get 'em, dawg, let them know it's over, G
Ooh-wee, money over everything
Oh, goddamn, you almost got me there, that was a close one
Hahaha, I know you want me, but you can't get me, bitch-ass faggot

[Chorus]
Give me that fame, give me that money
I got no shame for these dummies
Out of my way, you ain't my buddy
You sure as hell ain't gonna get lucky
Give me that fame, give me that money
This my game, don't act funny
Call me insane, that's right, buddy
It's raining now, it's gonna get muddy
Give me that fame, give me that money
Got no shame for these dummies
Give me that fame, give me that money
This my game, don't act funny
Call me insane, that's right, buddy
It's raining now, it's gonna get muddy

[Outro]
Fucking bitch, you're my little bitch
Little fucking doggy
I got you on the fucking leash, you little bitch
Hahaha, yee, nah-nah, it's not over yet, bitch
