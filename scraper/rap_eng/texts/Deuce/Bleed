[Verse 1]
Since I'm inside this prison when I speak nobody listens
They label me villainous, conforming to one religion
All of your inquisitions are going down in remission
It's about time you witnessed the power of one decision
A lifestyle for you fucking cowards
You made a false description to a kid's addiction
These words are louder, they're the fucking powder
To my gun's ignition when it shoots the children

[Pre-Chorus]
This is blood for their soul
Don't care what you've been told
I am not alone

[Chorus]
Bleed what you've done
Bleed just for us
You can hide but you can't run
One day you'll end up where you belong
Bleed what you've done
Bleed, get or got?
You can try and play it dumb
One day someone's gonna wake you up
Hey, I don't give a fuck
Hey, you ain't getting no love
Hey, don't think too much
'Cause this time you're out of luck

[Verse 2]
I'm viewed as the rebel who worships Satan, praises the devil
I've been itching to tell you I'm gonna be here longer than forever
Your sniveling won't help, you might as well be looking down the barrel
If I'm burning in hell, then I guess we're all going down together
I won't bow even if your crown
Was meant to be from heaven or it was Armageddon
I won't look down even if I'm bound
Going in no direction, ready for redemption

[Pre-Chorus]
This is blood for their soul
Don't care what you've been told
I am not alone

[Chorus]
Bleed what you've done
Bleed just for us
You can hide but you can't run
One day you'll end up where you belong
Bleed what you've done
Bleed, get or got?
You can try and play it dumb
One day someone's gonna wake you...

[Breakdown]
Up, no matter what!
We're not giving up!
I won't ever keep my mouth shut!
Fuck what you've become!
We've had enough!
When I'm gone, I'll watch you succumb!

[Bridge]
How do you like me now?
Now that you're underground
Not making a sound?
I bet that you're proud
Of pulling us all down
Your sins will find you out
We don't need you around

[Chorus]
Bleed what you've done
Bleed just for us
You can hide but you can't run
One day you'll end up where you belong
Bleed what you've done
Bleed, get or got?
You can try and play it dumb
One day someone's gonna wake you up
Hey, I don't give a fuck
Hey, you ain't getting no love
Hey, don't think too much
'Cause this time you're out of luck
