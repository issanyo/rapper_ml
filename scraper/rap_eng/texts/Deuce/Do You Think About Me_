[Verse 1]
Without you, I'm just a small piece
Of this puzzle below my feet
I won't ever leave you, my dear
You've always been the best part of me
We don't know where we've been going
In a world that is so lonely
I just need for you to hold me
It's cold out there, and the wolves are moaning
One day you will get to know me
We can take it nice and slowly
I knew that you'd be the one to show me
Life is more than suffering only
I used to be where I was joking
Now it feels as if I'm choking
Maybe there's still hope, it'd help me
Blow me one last kiss 'fore I sing

[Pre-Chorus]
I never wanna leave from your side
Baby, please, no goodbyes
On my knees, hold me tight
I get so goddamn weak, teary-eyed
When you're not here, I'd rather die
I can't speak, cannot lie

[Chorus]
Do you think about me all the time?
When you're lost and out at sea, am I on your mind?
You put the color into my black and white
You're the free world to my fight
Can you hear my voice on the outside?
Am I with you on such lonely nights?
You take the wrong away from all the right
You bring me back to life

[Verse 2]
All I've got is all you gave me
Love that keeps us motivated
In this world contaminated
You're the only real thing that can save me
You're the one and only lady
That makes this place more amazing
When things get too complicated
We can always go back to what we created
Life isn't what you always make it
It can be so frustrating
When everything is failing
You're the only light that's emanating
When I just can't escape it
This hate that's in me lately
The picture that's being painted
You keep me from suffocating

[Pre-Chorus]
I never wanna leave from your side
Baby, please, no goodbyes
On my knees, hold me tight
I get so goddamn weak, teary-eyed
When you're not here, I'd rather die
I can't speak, cannot lie

[Chorus]
Do you think about me all the time?
When you're lost and out at sea, am I on your mind?
You put the color into my black and white
You're the free world to my fight
Can you hear my voice on the outside?
Am I with you on such lonely nights?
You take the wrong away from all the right
You bring me back to life

[Bridge]
There's a fairytale in your soul
It brought us together, gave us a new start
I was lost, falling apart
You gave me a spot somewhere in your heart
An act of God, a shooting star
You came from afar with open arms
It was so dark, as cold as November
Almost over, I told you

[Chorus]
Do you think about me all the time?
When you're lost and out at sea, am I on your mind?
You put the color into my black and white
You're the free world to my fight
Can you hear my voice on the outside?
Am I with you on such lonely nights
You take the wrong away from all the right
You bring me back to life
Do you think about me all the time?
When you're lost and out at sea, am I on your mind?
You put the color into my black and white
You're the free world to my fight
Can you hear my voice on the outside?
Am I with you on such lonely nights
You take the wrong away from all the right
You bring me back, back to life
