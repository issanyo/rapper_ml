[Intro: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
Hell's gonna break loose, gonna break loose
H-Hell, h-hell’s gonna break loose
Hell's gonna break, it's-it's-it's...
It's gonna break loose

[Chorus: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
I fucking hate you, I fucking hate you
I thought that you pussies knew, I thought you pussies knew
No matter what you do, no matter what you do
Hell's gonna break loose, it’s gonna break loose
Fuck what you been through, fuck what you been through
The shit that you say too, the shit you say too
No matter what you do, no matter what you do
Hell's gonna break loose, it's gonna break loose

[Verse 1: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
I fucking hate you, re-fucking-placed you, bitch, I'm gonna rape you
I got the balls to fuck face you; if I could, I would erase you
Derange you into weird shapes, dude, I punched your ass in the face too
I'll straight up run up and mace you, fuck this rap game, I hate you
Hate what I made you, it takes too much to remake you
Fake you, take you, to ache you, break you
I wouldn't save you, I'd butt-fucking-rape you
I'd fucking break you, I wouldn't save you, I'd butt-fucking-rape you

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
I'm blowing up like the World Trade Center
Told you motherfuckers I'll be here forever
We're stronger now, more than ever
When it goes down, we ain't going down together
No, bitch

[Chorus: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
I fucking hate you, I fucking hate you
I thought that you pussies knew, I thought you pussies knew
No matter what you do, no matter what you do
Hell's gonna break loose, it’s gonna break loose
Fuck what you been through, fuck what you been through
The shit that you say too, the shit you say too
No matter what you do, no matter what you do
Hell's gonna break loose, it's gonna break loose

[Verse 2: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
I shit on rappers like MGK and Marshall Mathers
They call me The Clapper, I'm going bananas
Hannah Montana's shit's smelling worse than a port-a-potty can-a
Oh man-a, if you're a fan-a, shake that ass up against my banana
I'm not a copycat-a
I'm an Illuminati killer, swinging out at motherfuckers with batters
I'm madder than me with a nine-millimeter gat-a, shit, it don't really matter
As long as I'm killing emcees till this clip is empty, fuck you faggots
I'm fucking killing emcees till this clip is empty, fuck you faggots

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
I'm blowing up like the World Trade Center
Told you motherfuckers I'll be here forever
We're stronger now, more than ever
When it goes down, we ain't going down together
No, bitch

[Chorus: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
I fucking hate you, I fucking hate you
I thought that you pussies knew, I thought you pussies knew
No matter what you do, no matter what you do
Hell's gonna break loose, it’s gonna break loose
Fuck what you been through, fuck what you been through
The shit that you say too, the shit you say too
No matter what you do, no matter what you do
Hell's gonna break loose, it's gonna break loose

[Bridge: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
You can't run, you can't hide, it'll take you
No matter what you decide, it'll break you
You can try to deny, but it makes you
I ain't living a lie, I'mma break through
The only thing in this place that'll save you
Is the same motherfucker that made you

[Chorus: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
I fucking hate you, I fucking hate you
I thought that you pussies knew, I thought you pussies knew
No matter what you do, no matter what you do
Hell's gonna break loose, it’s gonna break loose
Fuck what you been through, fuck what you been through
The shit that you say too, the shit you say too
No matter what you do, no matter what you do
Hell's gonna break loose, it's gonna break loose

[Outro: Deuce & James Kloeppel]
Hell's gonna break loose, it's gonna break loose
It's gonna break loose, it's gonna break loose
Hell's gonna break loose, it's gonna break loose
It's gonna break loose
