[Intro]
Yeah, y'all ready for this?
Turn that shit up, let's go

[Verse 1]
I hate what I became, so goddamn insane
A man without a brain that's trying to run away
By jumping off a plane, that's why I can't restrain
Myself from killing every motherfucker in this place
It's just a little late, wish I was Lil Wayne
Shit, I'mma keep on killing motherfuckers in my way
You better be afraid 'cause I'm about to break
Prepare for war, yeah, this is Judgment Day

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing's getting in my way
Don't really care what you say
I ain't really ever gonna change
Told you that I'm here to stay
Nothing's getting in my way
Told you I ain't really ever gonna change

[Chorus]
Here I come to have fun, better fucking run
Told you that I am never fucking done
Fear no one, here I come, better grab a gun
Until I die, I'm never fucking done

[Verse 2]
I can't make it, can't fake it
Wish that I could just break it
'Cause I hate it, did I make it?
Life's so short, it's too late, kid
To change it, so stop hating
It's too late, shit, to make changes
I'm still famous, it's not changing
Big Deuce, that's what the name is

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing's getting in my way
Don't really care what you say
I ain't really ever gonna change
Told you that I'm here to stay
Nothing's getting in my way
Told you I ain't really ever gonna change

[Chorus]
Here I come to have fun, better fucking run
Told you that I am never fucking done
Fear no one, here I come, better grab a gun
Until I die, I'm never fucking done

[Bridge]
Gotta get away to another day
There's gotta be some way, I know it's too late
There's gotta be somewhere I can escape
You can't run and hide, there's nowhere safe

[Chorus]
Here I come to have fun, better fucking run
Told you that I am never fucking done
Fear no one, here I come, better grab a gun
Until I die, I'm never fucking done
