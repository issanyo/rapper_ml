You can say what you want
You've got it all wrong
You go on and on and on
I really don't mind
Cruel to be kind, someone like you so hard to find
The look on your face, full of disgrace
You've got to stop acting like a child
You surely must know your thoughts are on show
There's really no way its just too wild

Call It Love if you want
I can see does it have to be here and now
If you want can't you see
Why is it always here and now?

You can think what you like
It's the same every night
You go on and on and on
I really don't mind, cruel to be kind
Someone like you so hard to find
The look on your face, full of disgrace
You've got to stop acting like a child
You surely must know your thoughts are on show
There's really no way its just too wild

Call It Love if you want
I can see does it have to be here and now?

If you want can't you see
Why is it always here and now?
