[Intro: Deuce]
I thought I told you, I came to party

[Verse 1: Deuce & Travie McCoy]
Hey bartender, can I get a cup?
Tonight's my night, and I'm getting fucked up
I hope I still got the charm, got the luck
'Cause all these bitches and hoes look like so much fun
And I just stepped in the club, feeling myself like a braille book
Double-fisting two pitchers of pale ale, both stale as fuck
And all these busted females lined up at the bathroom
In and out, we know what they doing

[Chorus: Deuce]
I came to party, I came to party
Hands up, girl, give me that body
I can tell you want something from me
'Cause everything you think, girl, I can see
I came to party, I came to party
Hands up, girl, give me that body
I'mma make you mine before I leave
'Cause every little thing you do to me got me going crazy
I thought I told you, I came to party

[Verse 2: Deuce & Travie McCoy]
Let's have a party, girl, you can bring your friends tonight
After the club, we can play all the games you like
Yeah, the stakes are high but if your cards are right
You'll be waking up naked, "what happened last night?"
Too bad you're just another notch in the bedpost, trying to get close and cuddly
My girl stays in Brooklyn, you just my West Coast fuck buddy
Get that through your skull, girl, I'm here for one night
And please quit fucking up my buzz 'cause I...

[Chorus: Deuce]
I came to party, I came to party
Hands up, girl, give me that body
I can tell you want something from me
'Cause everything you think, girl, I can see
I came to party, I came to party
Hands up, girl, give me that body
I'mma make you mine before I leave
'Cause every little thing you do to me got me going crazy
I thought I told you, I came to party
Yeah, I came, I came to party

[Bridge: Deuce & Truth]
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sipping on some bomb shit
Tick, tick, tick, tick, it's about that time, bitch
Sip, sip, sip, sip, we party hard and never quit
West Coast, East Coast, yeah, you loving it
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sipping on some bomb shit
Tick, tick, tick, tick, it's about that time bitch
Sip, sip, sip, sip, we party hard and never quit
Deuce, Truth, Travie, yeah, you loving it
Yeah, you l-l-l-l-loving it

[Chorus: Deuce]
I came to party, I came to party
Hands up, girl, give me that body
I can tell you want something from me
'Cause everything you think, girl, I can see
I came to party, I came to party
Hands up, girl, give me that body
I'mma make you mine before I leave
'Cause every little thing you do to me got me going crazy
