[Intro: Tha Villa]
Don't you wanna see it?

[Verse 1: Tha Villa]
It started off when I was five, riding on my bike
To shooting BB gun bullets at kids I didn't like
Then we laughed it off, never did I have it, dawg
I would reenact fun crazy little things I saw
When I went to school, Mom would stay by the phone
Just in case the principal decides to send me home
I always thought everything would change
Sold out shows, people screaming my name
But then again, the streets made me
Law here to blame me
If so, Lord, why don't you just take me off these streets
'Cause I'm tired of running from the police

[Chorus: Tha Villa]
Don't you wanna see? Don't you wanna be?
Street life got me running from the police
It went from hanging with the stars to me running from the law
This is just who we are
Don't you wanna see? Don't you wanna be?
Street life got me running from the police
It went from hanging with the stars to me running from the law
This is just who we are

[Verse 2: Tha Villa]
OG, OC, running from the police
I ain't trying to do it big, I'm trying to do it obese
Old boy from the hood, you can call him Oshay
Okay, real life, shit, this ain't no roleplay
Ain't no Hollywood, real niggas probably would
Snatch you up, beat you down, think you king, take your crown
Living life best I know, ghetto got me on the go
So I'm staying on my grind 'cause tomorrow might not show
Been through some real shit, y'all wouldn't understand
Doing good? Not, but wouldn't take that for granted
Wasn't nothing handed, ain't no silver spoons
Only silver bullets aimed with the extra zoom
Ugh, they got me aimed on the extra zoom
So I kicked a master plan in the extra room
Tucked away like what they say
'Cause that's the life of the streets, aye

[Chorus: Tha Villa]
Don't you wanna see? Don't you wanna be?
Street life got me running from the police
It went from hanging with the stars to me running from the law
This is just who we are
Don't you wanna see? Don't you wanna be?
Street life got me running from the police
It went from hanging with the stars to me running from the law
This is just who we are

[Verse 3: The Truth]
See the light, that's the truth, all you actors play your role
Drop them cards, play it right, swallow pride and never fold
I had no choice but to face the fact that my father's gone
Should I cry or man up? Proud to be my mother's son
Got a case and went to jail, under pressure, didn't tell
The truth, under oath, my heart is cold, I live by code
Came alone, I leave alone, mainline, walked the yard
Now I'm home, still grinding, clock winding, going hard
Same hood, same friends, so fly like Jordan 10's
Won't change but the raise, traded from a black Benz
Pop his head and forget it all, try not to trip and fall
Grabbed my girl, walked them off, faced the fact I want it all
Count me in, I'm all in, product of the environment
Think you hot? Think you not, turn you out like firemen
From zero, turned to hero, writing me, donâ€™t call me, blaow!
Hollyhood, that's my town, Nine Lives, it's going down

[Chorus: Tha Villa]
Don't you wanna see? Don't you wanna be?
Street life got me running from the police
It went from hanging with the stars to me running from the law
This is just who we are
Don't you wanna see? Don't you wanna be?
Street life got me running from the police
It went from hanging with the stars to me running from the law
This is just who we are
Don't you wanna see? Don't you wanna be?
Street life got me running from the police
It went from hanging with the stars to me running from the law
This is just who we are
Don't you wanna see? Don't you wanna be?
Street life got me running from the police
It went from hanging with the stars to me running from the law
This is just who we are
