[Intro: The Truth & Deuce]
Deuce, I think I see dead people
Yeah, Nine Lives
It's 187

[Chorus: The Truth]
I gon' take it to the grave
I gon' run this rap game
I gon' make you feel the pain
It's hip-hop and it ain't gon' be the same
I gon' take it to the grave
I gon' run this rap game
I gon' make you feel the pain
It's hip-hop and it ain't gon' be the same

[Verse 1: The Truth]
Black Chucks, black gloves, stolen with different plates
I'm the bomb like an ace, blowing up in your face
Blowing on that fucking haze, none of this is new to me
Nine Lives, motherfucker, been 'bout that jewelry
All day at the range, working on my game
Far from a fucking lame, back seat, getting brain
My screws ain't loose, homie, listen, they missing
The clock's steady ticking, winding while I'm grinding
Kinda cloudy in the Audi, sitting on some new wheels
Got a bottle of that bottle of prescribed pills
Pounding on that brown liquor, trying not to lose it
I ain't the type to flash the pistol unless I'mma use it
48 Laws of Power brushing through my memory
All this hate around me giving me the energy
I don't sleep, I take naps, money bring power
Gotta get this dough and I ain't talking 'bout the flour

[Chorus: The Truth]
I gon' take it to the grave
I gon' run this rap game
I gon' make you feel the pain
It's hip-hop and it ain't gon' be the same
I gon' take it to the grave
I gon' run this rap game
I gon' make you feel the pain
It's hip-hop and it ain't gon' be the same

[Verse 2: The Truth]
If you see me in traffic, maybe we can smoke a blunt
While Malcolm's in the middle, you can catch me in the front
You can learn a thing or two, I'm giving out lessons
The Truth, motherfucker, got answers to questions
Same year my father died, my choices was limited
Don't try to put my sneakers on unless you can fit in 'em
Running out of options, there ain't nothing I could ask for
You ain't flying till you got stamps in your passport
I ain't no photographer, you'll never catch me flash
I'm plain old Jason without the motherfucking mask
Real funny how these squeakers sucking on that glass dick
Ain't nobody faithful, bitch, black chalk, paperclips
Keep digging, little hamster punk bitch rat cats
But speak when you're spoken to, maybe I might answer
I drive-by and quiet down all the fucking noise
Respect your elders 'cause I ain't playing with you boys

[Chorus: The Truth]
I gon' take it to the grave
I gon' run this rap game
I gon' make you feel the pain
It's hip-hop and it ain't gon' be the same
I gon' take it to the grave
I gon' run this rap game
I gon' make you feel the pain
It's hip-hop and it ain't gon' be the same

[Verse 3: The Truth]
All my life, been alone, I don't need no damn help
Shadowboxing while they talking all about my damn wealth
California king, kush grow, and ride this fucking dick
Money in the Swiss bank, jewels in a fish tank
Got a problem with me? I'mma shoot it through your fucking polo
I'm a bird, call me Dodo, I'mma paint the perfect photo
I'mma keep it Desert Eagle while I'm creeping through the night
Cops come around, I'mma shake 'em like I'm shooting dice
Trunks stay open, like a snake, watch it rattle
I'm too much to handle, go to church, burn a candle
Must be lacking little milk, the way these kids crying
I can see it through their teeth, the way these kids lying
The Truth got night-vision, all he sees is fucking green
As shit pop off, I ain't the type to cause a scene
I fucked her in the back room, black hair, red crew
Came and turned Hollywood into Canc√∫n, yeah

[Chorus: The Truth]
I gon' take it to the grave
I gon' run this rap game
I gon' make you feel the pain
It's hip-hop and it ain't gon' be the same
I gon' take it to the grave
I gon' run this rap game
I gon' make you feel the pain
It's hip-hop and it ain't gon' be the same
