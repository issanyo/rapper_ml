[Chorus]
I am your worst nightmare
I'll get inside your head, you'll see me before it ends
I am your worst nightmare
Don't worry, don't be scared, I'm not going anywhere

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I bet you missed me, I'm the next new best thing
Ever since these emcees tried to mix the next thing
Rock is empty since that song with 10th Street
Kids keep connecting to this controversy
Homosexuality's still on your routine
Got a hard-on for me with a heart on your sleeve
Keep on stroking while your friend's performing
Moaning to the picture of the cock you're holding
All that emo shit is gone, this music is taking over
All these pussy ass promoters better get the fuck on board
'Cause homie, you know I ain't slowing, every hour I keep growing
I don't need no sugarcoating, now Allen Kovac keeps it going

[Pre-Chorus]
Here comes the pain over and over again

[Chorus]
I am your worst nightmare
I'll get inside your head, you'll see me before it ends
I am your worst nightmare
Don't worry, don't be scared, I'm not going anywhere

[Verse 2]
The game's still changing since I rearranged it
I approached the gangsta, put these kids in danger
Interscope hates me, y'all, they say I'm crazy
Because I got a buzz for 'em that's big as Jay-Z
Hail to the king while the ground is shaking
TMZ just found me, baby, it's groundbreaking
Oopsie-daisy, the same news daily
Every day I give the world a brand new statement
Internet's contaminated with every word that I'm saying
Bitches got my shit replaying, look at what I've generated
I came in and this game hated, but I'm back and I'm upgraded
Jorel turned me back into Satan, gotta love my reputation

[Pre-Chorus]
Here comes the pain over and over again

[Chorus]
I am your worst nightmare
I'll get inside your head, you'll see me before it ends
I am your worst nightmare
Don't worry, don't be scared, I'm not going anywhere

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry but this isn't what you planned
Someone like me finally in command
Everything's changing ever since I came back
Your made up love songs are all fucking trash
Went from rock to pop, that's why you're so whack
Must be why I got so many fans
When I'm on wax, ladies still say damn
Maybe that's why I got so many, oh yeah

[Bridge]
I'll be right there in your face
Invading, motherfucker, all up in your space
Gonna watch you go up in flames
Yeah, remember me? Gonna remember the name

[Chorus]
I am your worst nightmare
I'll get inside your head, you'll see me before it ends
I am your worst nightmare
Don't worry, don't be scared, I'm not going anywhere

[Outro]
This is a warning, yeah
Still got blood on my hands!
Don't fuck with me or else
I'll see you in fucking hell, yeah!
