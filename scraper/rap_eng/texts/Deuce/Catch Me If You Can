[Verse 1: Deuce]
I wanna party every day till I can't see straight
A new girl, each city, coming your way
Always getting fucked up till I'm puking out my brains
As long as I'm a rock star, nothing's gonna change
Strippers in the morning, liquor all day
Yeah, when I'm feeling horny, groupies got a brain
Always wear a condom, gotta play it safe
When the show's over, they come out to play
I go right past touching first base
As long as you got an itty-bitty waist
And got a nice little, itty-bitty frame
You know I'll do bad things to that little, pretty face

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce]
From LA to Tokyo
New York City, around the globe
First, you see me, but now you don't

[Chorus: Deuce]
Catch me if you can
I'm gone, bitch, all over the map
Not stopping, never going back
I'll never, ever give a damn
Catch me if you can
I won't quit, it's not who I am
Ain't hard for you to understand
Like a lion to a lamb
Catch me if you can

[Verse 2: Deuce]
I'm on top of the world, got money to burn
Went from bad to worse, rocking your girl
These bitches sporting my t-shirts
They be falling off when you see 'em crowd surf
Every night is just a blur
Keep sipping vodka until it hurts
Backstage with the one in the mini-skirt
Bring her back to the trailer, so we can get to work
I promise you it ain't gonna hurt
I'll be the patient, you can be the nurse
Switch it all around, we can both take turns
Gonna make sure you get what you're worth

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce]
From LA to Tokyo
New York City, around the globe
First, you see me, but now you don't

[Chorus: Deuce]
Catch me if you can
I'm gone, bitch, all over the map
Not stopping, never going back
I'll never, ever give a damn
Catch me if you can
I won't quit, it's not who I am
Ain't hard for you to understand
Like a lion to a lamb
Catch me if you can

[Verse 3: Gadjet]
Catch me if you can, every day's Friday
Friday, bitch, I'm the new Rebecca Black
Driving down that highway my way
Brand new tour bus, bring some warm ones in the back
Where we go is where the fun's at
And by fun, I mean getting in your pants
You know how we always keep getting out of hand
And how I keep the party rocking all frigging year, damn

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce]
From LA, from LA, from LA to Tokyo
New York City, around the globe

[Chorus: Deuce]
Catch me if you can
I'm gone, bitch, all over the map
Not stopping, never going back
I'll never, ever give a damn
Catch me if you can
I won't quit, it's not who I am
Ain't hard for you to understand
Like a lion to a lamb
Catch me if you can
I'm all over the map
I'm never going back
Too hard for you to understand?
Catch me if you can
I'm gone, bitch, all over the map
Not stopping, never going back
I'll never, ever give a damn

[Outro: Gadjet]
So throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
If you's a true player, we'll play Truth or Dare
If you want fun and games, well, they're over here
So throw your face down, right down here
And wave it all around like you just don't care
'Cause I'm a real player who never plays fair
We can all have fun, we all like to share
