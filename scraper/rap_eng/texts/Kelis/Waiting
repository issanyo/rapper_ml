[Verse 1]
This time, this time is my time
My life, lies in the base line
You tried to take what was all mine
My pride, I bowed down and I swear
My turn to make all the bells shine
I know that you know that I tried
I don't count the tears I've cried
This car has driven its last mile

[Chorus 1]
As I stand on the edge, for a love
Something to believe in
I'll just stand in the rain and then fall
For something to believe in

[Chorus 2]
Waiting around all of the time [x2]
For you, to get it right
Waiting around all of the time [x2]
For you, something to believe in
In another world, another life
I still belong to you
In another time, you'll still be mine
I belong to you

[Verse 2]
I'm right or you're right, so who cares
Forget the strangers' judgements and mean glares
I always did, what I thought had seemed fair
I walked away saved by the last hair
Not easily, my God I was so scared
Just so you know I can't help that I care
I pray you're well, I just know that I can't I can't
I can't be afraid

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
Even though it's at the end
A brand new morning can begin
And the sun will shine again, again
Again...Again...Again...again, again, again

[Chorus 2][x2]
