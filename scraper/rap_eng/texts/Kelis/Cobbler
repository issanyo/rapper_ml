[Verse 1]
When you walk in through the door
You smell just like the sun
Give you everything you want
Cause baby you're the one
Your bright eyes on your face
Gotta stop I'm runnin' late
Well, it's true, I tell my friends
Being with you just feels so great

[Chorus]
Ooh lately, you got this feeling like a holiday
Ooh baby, here in your arms, it's like a getaway
Ooh lately, you got this feeling like a holiday
Ooh baby, here in your arms, it's like a getaway

[Verse 2]
You're the best I've ever done
Like a winner like I won
I couldn't love you more
If I tried I'd go for tons
I used to say I run
But for this I know I'll stay
Cause for real it's the look on your face
Every time you say my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh lately, you got this feeling like a holiday
Ooh baby, here in your arms, it's like a getaway, getaway

[Chorus]
Ooh lately, you got this feeling like a holiday
Ooh baby, here in your arms, it's like a getaway
Ooh lately, you got this feeling like a holiday
Ooh baby, here in your arms, it's like a getaway

[Bridge]
You make me hit notes that I never sing
She never sings, sings these notes

[Chorus]
Ooh lately, you got this feeling like a holiday
Ooh baby, here in your arms, it's like a getaway
Ooh lately, you got this feeling like a holiday
Ooh baby, here in your arms, it's like a getaway
