I want ya, I need ya
I wake up first to feed ya
You're the only one I ever really loved (you're the man above)
I've been conquered and lovin' to you
You know all the real things I've been through, yeah
You rescue me when everyone has let me down
Like a soldier, you protect me from what's goin' down
But you better remember - talk to me like a lady
I know that you ain't crazy

Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)
Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)
Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)
Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)

Runnin' in the streets, you are the man
But when you come home, respect who I am
Keep it gangsta 'cause you 1ne on the block
But when you step inside the door, give the key to your heart
I'm not tryna wear the pants, they fit you right

But I'm your wife so in these hands, you put your life
Hold me like your baby, treat me like your lady
'Cause I know you ain't crazy

Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)
Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)
Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)
Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)

Just hold me close - I love you near
One look at you and I see so clear
The reason you won't let me down
'Cause I feel you in my heart
It's like I'm floatin' way up off the ground

Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)
Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)
Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)
Don't take my kindness for weakness (appreciate me)
