Perfect day just you and me
Let's make the whole wide world just leave
Turn on the answer machine
We're gonna lay around go nowhere fast

Give a little love
Right to me
Give a little love
Right through me
Give a little love
My baby
Give a little love
Come save me

Having you right next to me
See you're the only thing that I can see
We fit together perfectly
We're gonna lay around go nowhere fast

Give a little love
Right to me
Give a little love
Right through me
Give a little love
My baby
Give a little love
Come save me

Give a little love
Give a little love

Only you and me
Only you and me so happy
Only you and me
Only you and me so nasty

Only you and me
Only you and me so happy
Only you and me
Only you and me so nasty

Perfect day just you and me
Let's make the whole wide world just leave
Turn on the answer machine
We're gonna lay around go nowhere fast

Give a little love
Right to me
Give a little love
Right through me
Give a little love
My baby
Give a little love
Come save me

Only you and me
Only you and me so happy
Only you and me
Only you and me so nasty

Only you and me
Only you and me so happy
Only you and me
Only you and me

Only you and me so happy
Only you and me so nasty
Only you and me so happy
Only you and me

Give a little love

Give a little love

Give a little love
