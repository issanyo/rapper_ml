Okay Kelis,making it outta here
Spragga Benz on the track, get over here Kelis
It's like that, it's that Kelis, grazzily insane
Kelis and Sparaggess, dance Kelis
Hollow, watch a little

Go left, go right, go all day, go all night
Keep doing it to the right, in the pocket stuck it up tight
Build it up now, get it too good, I'm in patience
Watcha body do good? Don't move it, babe
Hold it right there, I'm a do my own thing over here
Play all night, here I come

Well, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm comin' through
So hold steady feel the fire like the suns on you
Get it up, keep it up dance with me all night long
No problem, you know I got the flow, come on, let's go
I got Kelis with me and the fire is growing up slow

Where there's fire there danger, don't wanna know where time
Sparks are flying between with me, exchanging blazes
So hurt somebodies bound together, I feel the heat
From my fire and there no return, I don't wanna, let's go
(Go, here we go, watch your flow, graises)

Go left, go right, go all day, let's not fight
Keep listening hold me up tight, don't let me go
It's early in the night, give it up now, hit it too good
Watch me close up, watch my body do good, don't move it
Babe, hold me right there, I'm a do my own thing over here
Play all night here I come

Well, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm comin' through
So hold steady feel the fire like the suns on you
Get it up, keep it up, dance with me all night long
No problem, you know, I got the flow
Come on, let's go I got Kelis with me
And the fire is growing up slow

Where there's fire there danger, don't wanna know where time
Sparks are flying between with me, exchanging blazes
So hurt somebodies bound together, I feel the heat
From my fire and there no return, I don't wanna, let's go
(Go, here we go, here we go, red square)

Danger, danger, let's all be aware, we be raisin' the roof on air
Feelin' excitment, it's in the air, Kelis be changin' the atmosphere
Look out ladies about next year, all our root boys
The one other, the way you movin' your lips
And your sexy lips and loosin' beyond compare

Where there's fire there danger, don't wanna know where time
Sparks are flying between with me, exchanging blazes
So hurt somebodies bound together, I feel the heat
From my fire and there no return, I don't wanna, let's go
(Go, here we go, watch your flow, graises)
