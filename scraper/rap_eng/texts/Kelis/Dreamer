[Verse 1]
Weighing heavy on my heart
Every thought shoots like a dart
Where it lands is where I'll start
Is it a curse, or more, my art?
Giving love, and giving hate
Give me patience, and I'll wait

[Chorus 1]
Oh, dreamer, dreamer
Like a current through the stars
I'm a dreamer, dreamer
I'm a dreamer, dreamer

[Verse 2]
There are millions just like us
Fighting fears, and hiding love
Be the caffeine in the veins
All the necessary pains
Every moment fits a frame
Face to pillow, fades the shame
And if all was left to me
We'd be naked climbing trees

[Chorus 2]
Oh, dreamer, dreamer
Like a current through the stars
I'm a dreamer, dreamer
I'm a dreamer, I'm a dreamer

[Chorus 3]
Dreamer
Like a current through the stars
I'm a dreamer, dreamer
I'm a dreamer, dreamer
