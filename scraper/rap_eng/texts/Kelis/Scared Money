[Verse 1]
Come to my window
I'll leave it open
Sometimes a girl just needs fresh air
I have a garden
Do you like flowers?
Just through the gates it is my world

Let's take a ride
You'll drive my car
We'll put the top down and name stars
I have this candy
My mother gave me
I'll share if you don't tell no one

[Chorus x2]
I know you're afraid to come with me
But tonight I'm gonna present you with pleasure, with pleasure
See scared money don't make none
So roll with me and I will be your treasure, your treasure

[Verse 2]
It's raining now, I'm soaking wet
But I think I like it baby
It's hot in here, I'll make it clear
That I really want you baby

I'm fighting porn and it's still morning
You make me leave my conscience baby
I'm not scared of truth or dare
But nothing is just nonsense baby

[Chorus x2]
I know you're afraid to come with me
But tonight I'm gonna present you with pleasure, with pleasure
See scared money don't make none
So role with me and I will be your treasure, your treasure
