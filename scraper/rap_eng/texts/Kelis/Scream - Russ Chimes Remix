Been running in place for such a long time

Stuck in a race in the wrong line

When it all came down on me

And i haven't had faith for such a long time

Am i outta place or out of my mind

Should it all fall down on me

Its not enough to live so just dream

Its not enough to live so just dream

Its not enough to live so just dream

Its not enough to sing so just scream

Youll never know

If you dont let it out

You've had enough

Thell call your bluff

You can't back down lost in a crowd

Youve won the right to scream and shout

They'll talk about you lost your cool

There is no point who makes the rules

So lets get to it

Now youll prove it

Break out

Scream and shout

Scream and shout

Scream and shout

Scream and shout

Been running in place for such a long time

Stuck in a race in the wrong line

When it all came down on me

And i haven't had faith for such a long time

Am i outta place or out of my mind

Should it all fall down on me

Its not enough to live so just dream

Its not enough to live so just dream

Its not enough to live so just dream

Its not enough to sing so just scream

Sound the alarm

Raise your arms

Your on your own

Your not alone

Big city got you on the ground

Afraid to fight dont make a sound

So lets get to it

Now youll prove it

Push back

Scream and shout

Scream and shout

Scream and shout

Scream and shout

Been running in place for such a long time

Stuck in a race in the wrong line

When it all came down on me

And i haven't had faith for such a long time

Am i outta place or out of my mind

Should it all fall down on me

Its not enough to live so just dream

Its not enough to live so just dream

Its not enough to live so just dream

Its not enough to sing so just scream
