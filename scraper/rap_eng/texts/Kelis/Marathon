Life is this marathon
I'm running for you baby
And you don't know me yet
But faith is all I have, see
And I'm gonna win this race
And I'm gonna win this race

Since I were a little girl
My eyes were fixed on you
I knew that one day we'd meet
That you could set me free
Sure diamond ring, pretty things
A piece of mind, could be all mine
Oh, this growing love affair
Has kept me on my feet

Life is this marathon
I'm running for you baby
And you don't know me yet
But faith is all I have, see
And I'm gonna win this race
And I'm gonna win this race

Life is this marathon
I'm running for you baby
And you don't know me yet
But faith is all I have, see
And I'm gonna win this race
And I'm gonna win this race

Yesterday I had a glimpse of you
You looked me in my face
And just the other day you brushed right by me
I felt you reeling in my space
Tell me, do you think of me
Can you see me from the start
I swear I said I'd wait for you
But fate might change the score

Life is this marathon
I'm running for you baby
And you don't know me yet
But faith is all I have, see
And I'm gonna win this race
And I'm gonna win this race

Life is this marathon
I'm running for you baby
And you don't know me yet
But faith is all I have, see
And I'm gonna win this race
And I'm gonna win this race

Oooh, oooh...

Okay, now swallow
