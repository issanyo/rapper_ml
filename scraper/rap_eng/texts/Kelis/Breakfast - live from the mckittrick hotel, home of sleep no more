Hi guys
Are you hungry?
My mom made food

I wanna say thank you
You were more than just a man
You've really been my friend

And I wanna say thank you
Thank you
For putting me to the test
When I know you could have left me behind

When I'm feeling like I'm knocked back off
My feet
And I swear I'm all alone
You're the one who carries me

Simple thing like giving me your peace
You're strong enough to be
Exactly what I need

This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

Sometimes it's just so dark
And I can't see past my hand
But you're solid as a rock
You're everything I'm not
And when I've done all that I can
You told me still to stand

And when it's said and done
I am just what
I am

So much of who we are
Is from who taught us how to love
So much of who we are
Is from who first taught us how to love

This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

This is the real thing
The real thing with us

Maybe we'll make it to breakfast
Maybe we'll make it to breakfast
Maybe we'll make it to breakfast
Maybe we'll make it to breakfast

This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

This is the real thing
The real thing with us
