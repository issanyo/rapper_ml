[Verse 1: Kelis]
Got credit cards in my pocket
But I walk past bums all day (why, why, why)
I see dealers pushing poisons
But I have nothing to say (Why, why, why)
I date two people at the same time
Knowing it is twice the sin (Why,why,why)
Oh yes I have this little problem here
I'm being vain again (why,why)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey man I'm just listening to his teachings, my soul and heart
This is God's movie and I'm just tryna play my part
Time is running out and we've broken the seventh seal
The more I read I realize that UFOs are real

[Chorus: Kelis & Pharrell]
Hey Lil' Suzy
You don't have to cry no more
Hey lil' Bobby
Don't you worry about the war
Hey lil Jessica
You just keep up with the score
Cause God closes the windows
Next thing you know he opens doors

[Verse 2: Kelis]
I blew my paycheck
Gettin' real high today (why,why,why)
I lied and told my nephew that I had no more time to play
(why,why,why)
I saw this lady gettin' robbed, I looked away (why,why,why)
I put my grandma in a home
And I made her stay (why, why)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey man I'm just listening to his teachings, my soul and heart
This is God's movie and I'm just tryna play my part
Time is running out and we've broken the seventh seal
The more I read I realize that UFOs are real

[Chorus: Kelis & Pharrell]
Hey Lil' Suzy
You don't have to cry no more
Hey lil' Bobby
Don't you worry about the war
Hey lil Jessica
You just keep up with the score
Cause God closes the windows
Next thing you know he opens doors

Singin' la la lala la
Lala lala la lala la

[Verse 3: Kelis]
I give in church
But you are asking me where it really goes (why,why,why)
I could give more
But I end up spending it on shoes and clothes (why,why,why)
I chew ice
Look at my watch some Middle Eastern babies sold (why,why,why)
In the winter I have furs knowing some poor child is cold
(why,why)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey man I'm just listening to his teachings, my soul and heart
This is God's movie and I'm just tryna play my part
Time is running out and we've broken the seventh seal
The more I read I realize that UFOs are real

[Chorus: Kelis & Pharrell]
Hey Lil' Suzy
You don't have to cry no more
Hey lil' Bobby
Don't you worry about the war
Hey lil Jessica
You just keep up with the score
Cause God closes the windows
Next thing you know he opens doors

Singing la la la la la
Singing la la la la la
Singing la la la la la
Singing la la la la la
Singing la la la la la
