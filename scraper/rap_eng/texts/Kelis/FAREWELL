[Verse 1: Kelis & (Dan Black)]
I repeat another day, so I look back
Seems a life away, the way we laughed
You told a certain saying, but there we lay
As strangers from the past
The way we laughed
(Well there's millions just like us that feel they've failed
Their ships have sailed
Catch the wave)

[Chorus (Both)]
Farewell
Farewell
Farewell, farewell, farewell
Farewell
Farewell
Farewell, farewell, farewell

[Verse 2: Dan Black & (Kelis)]
I repeat another day, in between
The way we were now just a dream
(Well there's millions just like us, that feel they've failed
They're ships have sailed
Catch the wave)

[Chorus (Both)]
Farewell
Farewell
Farewell, farewell, farewell
Farewell
Farewell
Farewell, farewell, farewell

I repeat another day, in between
The way we were now just a dream
