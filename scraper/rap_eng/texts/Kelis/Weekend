(It's the weekend! It's the weekend!
It's the weekend! And them freaks are comin'!
Oh! Them freaks are comin'!)

This is my song, this is my life, baby it's on
Somebody told me, the weekend's just for me
All through the week, I've been at work, doing my job
Then somebody told me, the weekend's just for me

Oooh-oooooh (The weekend's coming! And them freaks are coming)
Oooh-oooooh (The weekend's coming!)
Here come the beats, n****!
Boom!, and the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom, and the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom, and the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom, and the beat go boom, boom!

I know what we can do on the weekend
Baby - We can party all night, yeah, baby
I know what we can do on the weekend
(It's the weekend!)

I just got paid, it's Friday night, and I feel alive
And somebody told me, this club was built for me
They're playing my song, it feels so right, I'm gonna dance in the night
And somebody told me, this beat was made for me

Oooh-oooooh (The weekend's coming! And the freaks are coming)
Oooh-oooooh (The weekend's coming!)
Here come the beats, n****!
Boom!, and the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom, and the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom, and the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom, and the beat go boom, boom!

I know what we can do on the weekend
Baby - We can party all night, yeah, baby
I know what we can do on the weekend
Baby - We can party all night, yeah, baby

(It's the weekend! It's the weekend!
And them freaks are comin'! oh! Them freaks are comin'!
It's the weekend! It's the weekend!)

Oooh-oooooh (The weekend's coming! And the freaks are coming)
Oooh-oooooh (The weekend's coming!)
Here come the beats, n****!
Boom!, and the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom, and the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom, and the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom, and the beat go boom, boom!

I know what we can do on the weekend
Baby - We can party all night, yeah, baby
I know what we can do on the weekend
Baby - We can party all night, yeah, baby
