There's an awful world inside of me
You wouldn't believe all the things I've seen
Who should I be? The sounds stifle me
To feed in fear, try penetration here

Help me, help me
Help me, help me

The realest part is my reflection's clear
I know it's crazy but the end is near
We're all alone, and judgements will reveal
Deep coat cause some will have eternity

Help me, help me
Help me, help me

This is just my destiny so come with me
This is just my destiny so come with me
This is just my destiny so come with me
This is just my destiny so come with me

Help me, help me
Help me, help me
