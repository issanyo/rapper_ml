[Intro]
I said, "Alright dad, the game's up,"
Oh, I said, "Alright dad, the game's up,"
Oh, I said, "Alright dad, the game's up,"
Oh, I said, "Alright daddy, game over."

[Chorus]
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I said, I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees

[Chorus]
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I said, I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees

[Verse 1]
Price on everything, and sister said, "That ain't right,"
But you say, "That's the thing," and I just don't wanna fight
But see, the Bible never said, "Find a man, and take that man to bed," see
Quite contrary, hey, I, I know what it said
'Cause you ain't right, you ain't right, no, no

[Chorus]
Give me what I want, give me what I need see
I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees
Give me what I want, give me what I need see
I'm beggin' you please, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, give me what I want, give me what I need see
I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees
Give me what I want, give me what I need see
I'm beggin' you please, oh

[Verse 2]
Prize for someone else, but you dirty up my life, see
You just make a mess, and sure the idea sounds nice, but
You're not even, you're not even what I like, see
I want that tall drink of water I notice in the corner

[Interlude]
Hey you!
Who us?
Hey you!
Who us?
Yeah you!
I need ice cold water
I need ice cold water
She needs ice cold water
She needs ice cold water
She needs ice cold water
She needs ice cold water
Rock back and forth with me
No, not too close to me
Rock back and forth with me
No, not too close to me
Rock back and forth with me
No, not too close to me
Rock back and forth with me
Oh no, no, no, no
Well alright!

[Chorus]
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I said, I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees

[Chorus]
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I said, I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees

[Chorus]
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I said, I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees

[Chorus]
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I said, I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees

[Chorus]
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees
Give me what I want, give me what I need
I said, I'm beggin' you please, I'm down on my knees
