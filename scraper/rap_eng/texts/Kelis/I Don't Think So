You think you might have a chance
I don't think so
You're tellin' me to be nice
I don't think so
You wanna get in my pants
I don't think so
I don't think so
I don't think so
You think you might have a chance
I don't think so
You're tellin' me to be nice
I don't think so
You wanna get in my pants
I don't think so
I don't think so
I don't think so

I can see it in your eyes
You talk to me like I'm your prize
But I don't want you in my life alright
And I think you know that
I know what I really need
And trust me you're not at my speed
But I don't want you in my life alright
You should know by now that

You think you might have a chance
I don't think so
You're tellin' me to be nice
I don't think so
You wanna get in my pants
I don't think so
I don't think so
I don't think so
You think you might have a chance
I don't think so
You're tellin' me to be nice
I don't think so
You wanna get in my pants
I don't think so
I don't think so
I don't think so

You can try
You can lie
Till you die
You and I
No
No
I don't think so

Sorry you don't have a clue
But I don't have the time for you
Got my eye on someone else tonight
And I think you know that
I'm the only force on me
But you keep living makebelieve
Got my eye on someone else tonight
You should know by now that

You think you might have a chance
I don't think so
You're tellin' me to be nice
I don't think so
You wanna get in my pants
I don't think so
I don't think so
I don't think so
You think you might have a chance
I don't think so
You're tellin' me to be nice
I don't think so
You wanna get in my pants
I don't think so
I don't think so
I don't think so

You can try
You can lie
Till you die
You will die
No
No
I don't think so
