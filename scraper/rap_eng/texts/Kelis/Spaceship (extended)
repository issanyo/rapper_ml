Jump on spaceship
Jump on spaceship
Jump on spaceship
Jump on spaceship

(Kelis)
Sittin' on top of the world
Watchin' the stars.... Go by

I got my head in a dream
Got my head in a cloud

I can fly
I can fly
I can fly

So get high, get high
Get high, get high
So get high, get high
Get high, get high

Sittin' on top of the world
Watchin' the stars.... Go by

I got my head in a dream
Got my head in a cloud

I can fly
I can fly
I can fly

So get high, get high
Get high, get high
So get high, get high
Get high, get high

Yeah

(apl.de.ap)
You better move
Check out the baseline groove
Take control of your body soul
Let the rhythm just take control
Once the beat drops, it explodes
Technologic overload
Take the music around the globe
Take control of your body soul, soul, soul
Let's go

(Jean-Baptiste)
Jump on a spaceship, take off
Jump on a spaceship, go off
Jump on a spaceship, take off
Jump on a spaceship, get on

Sittin' on top of the world

So get high, get high
Get high, get high
So get high, get high
Get high, get high

Sittin' on top of the world
Watchin' the stars.... Go by

I got my head in a dream
Got my head in a cloud
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly

Yeah
So get high (come on) get high (come on)
Get high, get high
So get high, get high
Get high, get high
