[Intro: Basement Jaxx]
Baaasemeeent Jaaaaxx...

[Verse 1: Kelis]
Coming loose, at the seams
Blind spots, voices
Control's gone, I'm like a balloon
Cut it out, emotion
Distance, it grows now
You don't, reach for me
All I got, all I got
Is my scars

[Pre-Chorus: Meleka]
Save me give me wings to fly
Make me your reason to fight
Suddenly we'll cross a home
Remember me into the morn

[Chorus: Meleka]
Kiss me then I'll wake up (x5)
Fairy tales make up

[Verse 2: Kelis]
Headlights, black demons
Peering in my hollow core
Grudges they're strangling
On splinters and dry skin

Streetlights, they see me
The whole world will reach for me
All I got, all I got
Is my scars

[Pre-Chorus: Meleka]
Save me give me wings to fly
Make me your reason to fight
Suddenly we'll cross a home
Remember me into the night

[Chorus: Meleka]
Kiss me then I'll wake up (x5)
Fairy tales make up

[Verse 2: Chipmunk]
I'll kiss you then you'll wake up
Don't want you to meet your maker
And you don't believe in fairy tales
Well truly I'm gonna make ya

Cause I've come here to save ya
Finna none of that miss I'mma take ya
I can rap I can rhyme like karma
Be your knight in shining armor

Oh no I ain't got no Porsche
Just give me a shield and a sword and a horse
And I'll come ridin' ridin' ridin'
Give me a little one on the back

I'mma turn around and get you on back
I'mma turn around and get you on back
It's gone right from fiction to a fact
I'm gonna take you out this world, oh!

[Chorus: Meleka]
Kiss me then I'll wake up (x5)
Fairy tales make up

Kiss me (x5)
Fairy tales make up
