[Verse 1: Kelis as "The Continent"]
I am 'The Continent'
Working with the moon
No one even knows me
But I'm always cold and blue
I move around the earth
There are worlds of things within me
My belly's always full
Freedom's glides on surface

[Pre-Chorus: Kelis]
Yes, my heart is deep within
Nations dive and trust me
Nations dive and trust me
I lay them at my shores
They dance with me in time

[Chorus: Bj√∂rk and Kelis]
You show me continents
I see the islands
You count the centuries
I blink my eyes
Hawks and Sparrows
(Theres no one I can't reach)
Race in my waters
(Only I reflect the sky)
Stingrays are floating
(My power yes is infinite)
Across the sky
(I do this all for you)
Little Ones
(I do this all for you)
My sons and my daughters
(I do this all for you)

[Outro: Both] (x2)
Your sweat is salty
I am why
I am why
I am why
