Come join our circus where we all wear masks
Lying while our fans are expected to last
Could it be that the jig is on us?
Masquerading like we are the one
Can you blame us?
It started as fun
Didn't know that the game must be won...
Sorry

Never did I lie; never did I need a trick yall
But they told me this how they get rich yall
Make a hit song, same lame lyrics, same bass, same kickdrum
Buy the record you became a big big victim
Bitch can't front, get what I want, neck, hands and my wrist numb
Sick none, diamonds on my wristband
Who I'm talking to? You, you and my biggest fan
Thinking that ya girl got it all, and I got the best man, best hair, best legs
Need a break, you in my face, asking K, what I'm putting out next year
Is it gonna be real freaky, critics wanna come critique me
Are you gonna be more grunge, rock and roll like back when you dropped before
But get back, before I get ill
Black love, black mask, listen to some real black love
That's all I have, that's all I have

Come join our circus where we all wear masks
Lying while our fans are expected to last
Could it be that the jig is on us?
Masquerading like we are the one
Can you blame us?
It started as fun
Didn't know that the game must be won...
Sorry

Musicians, magicians, tightropes, strobe lights, lion tamers, entertainers, Sold Out Nights
Dressing rooms, costumes, who's doing who? Gossip rumors
Groupies just too much, everybody's like let's do lunch
That's why it doesn't matter
That's why I'm not a rapper
Still spit a few bars, might never hear this song
Label might say hell naw, get a new female star
She don't have to sing, she don't have to bring anything
Get her some new earrings, fly her off to Beijing
Book her shows in Wyoming, David Letterman and Conan
Your advance just alone and doesn't it all sound grand?
Number one on soundscan, just keep the clubs bouncing

Come join our circus where we all wear masks
Lying while our fans are expected to last
Could it be that the jig is on us?
Masquerading like we are the one
Can you blame us?
It started as fun
Didn't know that the game must be won...
Sorry

How can I shake this circus clown?
What does the ringmaster need from this clown?
Should I dive through the circle of fire?
No... I'm just gonna be me

Come join our circus where we all wear masks
Lying while our fans are expected to last
Could it be that the jig is on us?
Masquerading like we are the one
Can you blame us?
It started as fun
Didn't know that the game must be won...
Sorry
