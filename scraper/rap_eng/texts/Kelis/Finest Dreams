[Intro]
Oh, baby, you're the finest, the finest (I've seen)
Oh, baby, you're the finest, the finest (I've seen)
Oh, baby, you're the finest, the finest (I've seen)
Oh, baby, you're the finest, the finest (I've seen)

[Verse 1]
If I had a choice
I'd always choose love
Up or down, good or bad, I don't mind
Just as long as it's real
My friends say I'm lucky
To have found someone as good as you
My lost understanding
Understanding how to hold on to

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through
Time won't  change the way I feel about you
Count all the love before
You're the finest I'll ever know (the finest I'll ever know)
After all that we've been through (we've been through)
Time won't change the way i feel about you
Count all the love before
You're the finest I'll ever know (the finest I'll ever know)

[Interlude]
Baby, you're the finest
I never met anyone like you
You can call me
I'll come running, just call me

[Verse 2]
If I had to choose, I'd be by myself
I want to be in love
But with nobody else
Time flies when you're with me
Goes so slow whenever you're away
Made up my mind and I'm positive
I've fell in love and it'll never go away

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through
Time won't  change the way I feel about you
Count all the love before
You're the finest I'll ever know (the finest I'll ever know)
After all that we've been through (we've been through)
Time won't change the way i feel about you
Count all the love before
You're the finest I'll ever know (the finest I'll ever know)

[Bridge]
Oh, baby, you're the finest, the finest (I've seen)
Oh, baby, you're the finest, the finest (I've seen)
Oh, baby, you're the finest, the finest (I've seen)
Oh, baby, you're the finest, the finest (I've seen)

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through
Time won't  change the way I feel about you
Count all the love before
You're the finest I'll ever know (the finest I'll ever know)
After all that we've been through (we've been through)
Time won't change the way i feel about you
Count all the love before
You're the finest I'll ever know (the finest I'll ever know)
