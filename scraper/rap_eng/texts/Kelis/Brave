[Verse 1]
I'm not ashamed of winning
But it wasn't that way in the beginning
It was this way
It was kiss me
Come kick me and diss me
I had to give it up
Now it's a way different feeling
You took my soul, I had to steer it back
Now it's this way
Now it's flipped, babe
A mistake, just listen
I had to give it up

[Acoustic Live Extra Part]
(I drove an old school Beamer
You drove an eighteen-wheeler
With nuclear bombs
Slowly dropping them down for fun
But I didn't run...)

[Verse 2]
All of this rain you've been given
Is just a reminder of living
It was crazy, had a baby
He's amazing, he saved me
And this time it's just us
You raised me up, I can say that
I was too young, I'll never get that back
Now it's this way
Now it's flipped, babe
I'm happy, just listen
I had to give it up

[Acoustic Live Extra Part]
(I drove an old school Beamer
You drove an eighteen-wheeler
With nuclear bombs
Slowly dropping them down for fun
But I didn't run...)

[Chorus]
I was super cool
But now I'm super strong
I had nothing to lose
But I was super wrong
It was the circumstance
I got the power from
I was super tough
But now I'm super strong
Super strong

[Bridge]
I'm a Braveheart
I'm a Braveheart
I'm a Braveheart
So come and pin my purple heart
Come and pin my purple heart
Come and pin my purple heart
I didn't run...

[Chorus]
I was super cool
But now I'm super strong
I had nothing to lose
But I was super wrong
It was the circumstance
I got the power from
I was super tough
But now I'm super strong
I was super cool
But now I'm super strong
I had nothing to lose
But I was super wrong
It was the circumstance
I got the power from
I was super tough
But now I'm super strong
I was super cool
But now I'm super strong
I had nothing to lose
But I was super wrong
It was the circumstance
I got the power from
I was super tough
But now I'm super strong
