When I was young I had no one
I walked alone, I never thought
I'd find someone who I could come home to
Until there was you
Until there was you

You lift me up into the sky;
Won't let me fall, just push me up
Higher and higher
You fill me up - I'm still hungry
For more of you
It tastes like love to me

You may not believe but I am living proof
Open up your heart and love will come to you
If you don't believe I'm telling you my truth
Open up your heart and love will find you too

No one is perfect, no, I won't ever be
You see my faults and keep on feeling me
And now I know wherever I could go
I will never have to walk alone

You lift me up into the sky;
Won't let me fall, just push me up
Higher and higher
You fill me up - I'm still hungry
For more of you
It tastes like love to me

You may not believe but I am living proof
Open up your heart and love will come to you
If you don't believe I'm telling you my truth
Open up your heart and love will find you too

It took so long to get it right
But in your eyes there is a light
Much brighter than it's ever been
I'm in love with the real thing
I'm in love with the real thing

You may not believe but I am living proof
Open up your heart and love will come to you
If you don't believe I'm telling you my truth
Open up your heart and love will find you too

You may not believe but I am living proof
Open up your heart and love will come to you
If you don't believe I'm telling you my truth
Open up your heart and love will find you too
