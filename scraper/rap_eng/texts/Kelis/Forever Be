[Verse 1]
A lot of people hold their breath
Keepin' it in, waitin' for a sign
Can't let it out till the light has left
And the night comes on, and the moon is high

[Pre-Chorus]
We are here, you and I
Just in time to set a fire
To a secret, here's mine, here's mine
I was scared, terrified
Of the lines that I might forget to sing to you tonight

[Chorus]
There will never be another
Day for us to be lovers
I'll follow your lead, together;
And we'll forever be
And we'll forever be

[Verse 2]
A lot of people lose their step
Tryna find their way in troubled times
Holding on to a promise kept
And when the lights go down
And the heart is blind

[Pre-Chorus]
We are here, you and I
Just in time, to set a fire
To a secret, here's mine, here's mine
I was scared, terrified
Of the lines that I might forget to sing to you tonight

[Chorus]
There will never be another
Day for us to be lovers
I'll follow your lead, together;
And we'll forever be
And we'll forever be

[Chorus]
There will never be another
Day for us to be lovers
I'll follow your lead, together;
And we'll forever be
And we'll forever be

[Chorus]
There will never be another
Day for us to be lovers
I'll follow your lead, together;
And we'll forever be
And we'll forever be

[Chorus]
There will never be another
Day for us to be lovers
I'll follow your lead, together;
And we'll forever be
And we'll forever be
