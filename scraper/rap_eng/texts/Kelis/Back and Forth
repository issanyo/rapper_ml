[Verse 1: Kelis]
I'm just so grateful that you walked in my life
Only a fool wouldn't let you out of his sight
I feel so grateful for this four-on-the-floor
You took ahold of me like never before

[Chorus: Kelis]
Oh, back and forth
You're loving me, play like tug-of-war
You wave the white flag, but I want more
Back and forth, I want more, I want more

[Verse 2: Kelis]
I think it's funny, you made me put down my pride
To tell the truth to you, I'll never lie
It's just so funny how things change after time
If it's with you, I'll smile the rest of my life

[Chorus: Kelis]
Oh, back and forth
You're loving me, play like tug-of-war
You wave the white flag, but I want more
Back and forth, I want more, I want more
Oh, back and forth
You're loving me, play like tug-of-war
You wave the white flag, but I want more
Back and forth, I want more, I want more

[Bridge: Kelis]
I'd like to try again with you
It's a game for two
And if you let me win this once
I'll make it worth it too

[Verse 3: Kelis]
Back and forth, I want more, I want more
I'm just grateful for this four-on-the-floor
You took ahold of me like never before

[Chorus: Kelis]
Oh, back and forth
You're loving me, play like tug-of-war
You wave the white flag, but I want more
Back and forth, I want more, I want more
