We're all running in a race
To find everything that you're searching for
Is right there

Your love is blinding
I'm already Home
The lights are shining
I'm already home
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

Who can you trust when you can't trust yourself to grow
So I made a vow and my faith only you I'll follow

Your love is blinding
I'm already home
The lights are shining
I'm already home
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

I'm not worthy never could be that I know
But somehow in spite of me you're always there to hold

Your love is blinding
I'm already home
The lights are shining
I'm already home
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

I can be a mess
I'm reckless and it shows
But with you I close my eyes and let you take control

Damn
Damn
Damn
Damn

Your love is blinding
I'm already home
The lights are shining
I'm already home
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
