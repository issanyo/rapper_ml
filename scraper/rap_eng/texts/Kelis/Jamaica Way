Well this is the Maestro
I have the doctorate for all things
It's just another one please

Mi nuh want nuh idle jubbie
Fi come hackle my body I say
The gal dem all a run mi dung
The gal dem all a hunt mi dung
The gal dem all a draw mi dung
Through dem wan s_ck out mi tongue
Dem say jump spread out, jump spread out
Gal jump spread out and wine

[Chorus]
A mi sey gal yuh a di wife

Han up inna di air yuh naw mek no fight
Yuh a di wife, man a treat yuh rite
