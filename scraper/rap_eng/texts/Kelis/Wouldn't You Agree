Wouldn't You Agree
When I first met you
You stood by my side
And when you asked me to be yours
You made me cry
And so I was prepared
To take all the blows at the chin
But you never mentioned cheating
Please tell me what happened
What makes you think
You'd get away with that
Talking to my best friend
Behind my back
Look waht you did to us
Look what you did to me
What a wonderful love loss
Wouldn't you agree
She introduced me to you
Said you were just friends
She showed me you were the one for me until the end
Now I should have known
By the magic between you two
That angel faces like yours can lie too
Can lie too
Look what you did to us
Look what you did to me
What a wonderful love loss
Wouldn't you agree
Wouldn't you agree
Wouldn't you agree
Wouldn't you agree
Wouldn't you agree
When I see my friends
They've got to know
I not only lost a friend
But now my hearts about to explode
Now there's something I'd like to say before I make my
Alternative
Oh God
Oh God
Do you see that
Did you see that
There they go
There they go
How could you do this to me
You kept lyin in my face
I thought you were my best friend
Behind my back
Look what you've done to me
Can't believe what you've done to me
Wouldn't you agree
He was my friend
My heart's about to explode
Wouldn't you agree (to fade)
