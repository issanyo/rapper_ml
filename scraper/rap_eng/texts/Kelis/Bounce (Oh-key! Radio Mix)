I can't believe that every day and every night (Bounce)
It's gettin' better with you out of my life (Bounce)
It's like I flicked a switch and now I'm feeling good (Bounce)
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could (Bounce)

When the waking comes I know I feel alive (Bounce)
You will be the last thing on my mind (Bounce)
No regrets, do you know what that means?

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild, we bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

I can love again tonight, we bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild, we bounce to this track
