I'm traveling off the cliff just to fall in love with you (I'm serious, I'm serious)
And we ain't got no plans on coming back soon, yeah (I'm serious, I'm serious)
I got my bags packed just to hit the road with you, cause (I'm serious, yeah, I'm serious)
And when it gets bumpy I'll be rollin' with you, cause (I'm serious, yeah, hey baby)

Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off

Oh baby, I'm runnin' on metal plates
Oh baby, I'm never gonna walk away
Even though we runnin' on metal plates
Oh baby, I'm runnin' on metal plates

My tank is all empty, but my heart is filled with fuel (I'm serious, oh, I'm serious)
I never run from nothing, but I'm running straight to you (I'm serious, I'm serious)
And I don't have no plans on coming back soon (I'm serious, I'm serious)
I know you scared, but they're coming on soon (It's serious, oh, serious)

Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off

Oh baby, I'm running on metal plates
Oh baby, someday we'll see better days
Oh, we'll be running on metal plates
Oh, we'll be running on metal plates

Ridin' shot gun baby
Keep on through
Emergency break off, pedal to the floor
We gonna move
Movin' fast hit the gas, crash
We gonna move
And remember the wheels fall off
Carry me through

Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
