[Verse 1]
I was walking, was living
My melody was acapella
There's a beat I was missing
No tune or a scale I could play
The sound in the distance
No orchestra playing together
Like a boat out to sea
The silence was too deafening

[Pre-Chorus]
So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

[Chorus]
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing

[Verse 2]
Everything was the same
One color was just like the others
An assembly routine
My memories were all black and white
Till I stopped overthinking
Decided to draw back the curtains
And I cleared all the cobwebs
And began to let in the light

[Pre-Chorus]
So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

[Chorus]
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing

[Bridge]
You got the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away
You got the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away
You got the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away

[Chorus]
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
