Saw her on a Friday outside some run down saloon
She was crying over someone that she felt left much too soon
I said, "Hey girl don't you cry tonight, let me take you out on this town"
She looked at me and smiled as one last tear splashed off the ground
With half a wink she asked me, "What are you some kind of creep?"
I told her, "No, I guess I just feel your vibe is kinda deep"
The moon hung over Soho and I counted 16 stars
I pointed at the brightest one and said, "Now that ones ours"

She's a dandelion up on a hill above the sea
She's not exactly everything I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion she looks like everything I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on

She just might be poison but I took her to my rooftop
I said, "Are you afraid of heights?" She said, "No, I am not"
I said, "Hey girl don't you lie to me, tell me everything you feel"
We danced around in circles she said, "I think we found something real"

She's a dandelion up on a cliff above the sea
She's not exactly everything I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion she looks like everything I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on
And I hold on hold on hold on

Down in Union Square I saw her walking all alone
I walked a little slower just so I'd remain unknown
She met someone on 17th and she knew him all too well
My little piece of heaven has a secret she won't tell
With half a smile she took his hand and then they walked away
I realized I wouldn't see my girl after today
I fell in love with the dandelion and she's all I ever had
At first she looks so sweet but in the end she tastes so bad

She's a dandelion up on a cliff above the sea
She's not exactly everything I thought that she might be
She's dandelion she looks like everything I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on
And I hold on hold on hold on
And I tell myself hold on hold on hold on
Yeah hold on hold on hold on

She's a dandelion up on a cliff above the sea
She's not exactly everything I thought that she would be
She's a dandelion she looks like everything I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
