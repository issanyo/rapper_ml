I was the first new born babe
Brought to you by the fearsome ‘Tunes
Here comes the nerds
Look in the sky
It’s the Clipse, and Nigo’s flying real high too
They’ll be here soon

Now Star Trak is here
We’ve come to save the day
When Star Trak has appeared
We’re going to pave the way

This is a new beginning
The empire strikes back
Learn from losing
Cherish winning
Forever Star Trak

This is a new beginning
The empire strikes back
Learn from losing
Cherish winning
Forever Star Trak

This is a new beginning
The empire strikes back
Learn from losing
Cherish winning
Forever Star Trak
