"Don't wake me
I'm still dreaming
I don't see you
I can't feel you
I'm alone for real in my mind
I'll feel this all night
When my life takes flight

This isn't just in your mind
We're suspended from space and time

I feel like I'm falling
What happens when I hit?
Must mean then that's it
This black abyss, this pit
It all seems shades of gray
I'm never ready for light of day

This isn't just in your mind
We're suspended from space and time
This isn't just in your mind
We're suspended from space and time

Why do you hurt me?
This reality
Why you smile at me?
Show your fallacies
Dreams hold me down
But let me go
When reality will wake me
I don't know

This isn't just in your mind
We're suspended from space and time
This isn't just in your mind
We're suspended from space and time

Am I dreaming?
If so, then why?
My bodies back on Earth
Only spirits can fly
Soaring through dimensions of love
Kinds only my father speaks of
Scenery changes, spins and roll
So does the color of our soul
I know how this must make you feel
You hate me but believe me this is real
This was real"
