Surfin' for love
Spellin' my heart out
Somewhere real far out
In a digital world

Messages to start my day
Been sitting on my bus since wednesday
Tried to hit you on your two way
Your mailbox was full all the way
We can meet tonight by satellite
What about half past midnight
I should just be off my flight
But for now I'll just dance and think about you

Electric love electric light electric life
Electric love electric light electric life
Lets just freak out freak out freak out
Me and you all alone
Freak out freak out freak out
But how we gonna freak off over the phone

I thought we were supposed to have a date
I guess he couldn't help but be late
It's ok I had to go
I had this conference call at 4 you know
I'm glad you paged me to say sorry
Cause I know your thinking of me
Don't worry baby I'm not angry
Cause for now I'll just dance and think about you

Electric love electric light electric life
Freak out freak out freak out
Me and you all alone
Freak out freak out freak out
But how we gonna freak off over the phone

Sugar we can do whatever tonight
Whatever you like but first darling
Can we get our jig on get our swig on
Head back to our crib, before these niggas get to drawin' up in here
Please mind me for asking
Have you ever had sex with a person with no attachments
And the heat of the moment
One night of passion
Nothing but a whole lot of grinding and grabbing
Moanin and groaning till six in the morning
By the time you rolling over yawning
You'll be hearing my car door slamming
And Perelli's ballin, Coldchain daddy for short honeysuckle Bartender, E&J on the rocks
Make it a double
By the way if I might say
You're looking quite ravishing in your Prada apparel
From the shoes to the bags
You're lucky I don't rob your ass dear
Cut to the chase, gimme your pin number
And lets get outta here

Surfin' for love
Spelling my heart out
Somewhere real far out
In a digital world

Electric love electric light electric life
Electric love electric light electric life
