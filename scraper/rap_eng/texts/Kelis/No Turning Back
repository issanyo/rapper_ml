You can search around the world
For different people for a thing called love
And you'll return with stories on how the perceive you
It just wasn't love
Your friends will say how they often see it
But what
They ain't talking 'bout love
They ain't talking 'bout love baby
Sing it baby
Just go inside and figure the many that don't believe it
Cause it just ain't love
Love love love love
Love love love

When in love with someone
When he leaves you can still feel it
Since you feel they're the one
Just close your eyes and you can still see it
If it's bright as the sun
There's no turning back

Yeah second verse what what what
I don't need your lavish lifestyle to please me
Why
Cause it just ain't love
If you notice kings and queens divorce so easy
Hmm hmm
Cause it just ain't love
Sing it baby sing it baby
The world could change if starving mouths were eating
But there is no love
Uh that's so true what
When your heart is starving now's the time to feed it
Enriched with love when you love someone
Come on come on

When in love with someone
When he leaves you can still feel it
Since you feel they're the one
Just close your eyes and you can still see it
If it's bright as the sun
There's no turning back

When in love with someone
When he leaves you can still feel it
Since you feel they're the one
Just close your eyes and you can still see it
If it's bright as the sun
There's no turning back

You can't deny
You can't deny you can't deny
When you're open wide
And what you're feeling inside
Is an all time high

When in love with someone
When he leaves you can still feel it
Since you feel they're the one
Just close your eyes and you can still see it
If it's bright as the sun
There's no turning back

Come on uh uh uh
You can't deny you can't deny
When you're open wide
And what you're feeling inside
What you're feeling inside
Is an all time high

When in love with someone
When he leaves you can still feel it
Since you feel they're the one
Just close your eyes and you can still see it
If it's bright as the sun
There's no turning back
