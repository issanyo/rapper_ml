[Verse 1]
When I had you
I treated you bad
And wrong my dear
And since, yeah
Since you been away

[Hook]
Dont'cha know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

[Verse 2]
I, I, I, I, I
Should have never ever
Ever made you cry
And since, oh
Since you been gone

[Hook]
Dont'cha know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

[Verse 3]
Life without love
Is oh, so lonely
I don't think that I
I'm gonna make it
All my life
All my life
Belongs to you only
Come on
Come on and take it
Because
All I can do
All I can do
Since you been gone is cry
And it's you, oooh
Yeah it's youu
Will never wonder
And worry your pretty little head
About what I do

[Hook]
Dont'cha know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you
