[Spliff Star]
Yeah, Let me show you what it is right now
Grip the 5th hit you in your shit right now
Make room my squad moving big right now
Stack chips, crib looking sick right now
Chicks I switch em like kicks right now
Sorry can't help it; I'm a pimp right now
My new revenue thick right now
Or I'd have to come back and cook a brick right now

[Rah Digga]
Near none of y'all hoochies couldn't move me right now
Went from Gap to Guess to a Gucci right now
Gunnin for your title, why bother right now
Some of y'all more bitch then Puffy's driver right now (stop)
Digga can rock; watch me spit it for blocks
In between big screens like I'm Vivica Fox
Second album showing no mercy right now
We first since Eminem controversial right now

(Chorus)
[Kelis (Busta Rhymes)]
Flipmode what it is right now (C'mon)
Flipmode what it is right now (Uh-ha, Uh-ha)
Flipmode what it is right now (All my people Uh-ha, Uh-ha)

Flipmode what it is right now (What you want nigga)
Flipmode what it is right now (Uh-ha, Uh-ha)
Flipmode what it is right now (All my people Uh-ha, Uh-ha)
Flipmode what it is right now (C'mon, Uh-ha, Uh-ha)

[Rampage]
We got you stuck right now
Shit we lookin for bitches to fuck right now
Chickens and Peacocks and ducks right now
Different birds with feathers to pluck right now
When we pull up in the truck right now
All black seven-forty deluxe right now
Niggas hate to self-destruct right now
Wishin that I was takin the bus right now

[Roc Marciano]
Let's get it on right now
I feel it more right now
Big and small and skin em all right down
Wide variety of kicks
And 9 times out of 10 I'm get a bitch
And get so...right now, I mean right now
Fuck a white gal in a tight towel, and right now
Things are like Iron Mike now
Throw hard rights and knock em out right now

(Chorus w/ different adlibs from Busta Rhymes)

[Kelis]
This be the beat to rock for the beats (yeah)
Bang that shit you crack the concrete (c'mon)
When we come thru you know we drop bombs
Flip-mode 2-k-1 dot com
Hands in the air till you weaken both arms
Ladies shake ya ass; fellas roll the charms
We keepin it street cause how we live
That's what it is baby, that what it is baby

[Baby Cham]
Uh, Yeah
It's QB right now
Niggas is wonderin who's he right now
He the nigga wit 20's on V's right now
Pushin a whip on empty streets right now
Fly by you catch a cab right now
Put your cap down to the Force Eclipse right now
Die slow got niggas pickin they scabs now
Let it bleed right now, close your eyes no sounds

[Busta Rhymes]
I thought I told you who it is right now
You ain't go to guess this ain't a fuckin quiz right now
Tap better like Melvin Giz right now
Bus-a-Bus the motherfucking grand wiz right now
In case you ain't knowing it's Flipmode right now
