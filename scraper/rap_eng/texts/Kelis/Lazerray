[Verse 1]
Four thousand years ago I came back to my senses
Jumped on a laser ray and blew into a new dimension
This vertical line, I watch it go by
Chopped down your master plan in nanoseconds, man
I hope you understand that nothing living lasts forever
This vertical line, I watch it go by

[Chorus]
I can feel it overheated
So bad, it makes me want to cry
I can feel it overheated
A burning heart unstuck in time

[Verse 2]
Now I'm a solar flare, now I'm that light that rages
Now I'm that laser ray that blows a hole right through the ages
This vertical line, I watch it go by
Ain't got no second-hand, just got my good intentions
Just got my laser ray exploding into new dimensions
This vertical line, I watch it go by

[Chorus]
I can feel it overheated
So bad, it makes me want to cry
I can feel it overheated
A burning heart unstuck in time

[Post-Chorus 1]
Well, I heard
From the Psychic Sun
That she could fuse us into one
If only we could take the light
Well, I got mine, yes, I got mine

[Verse 3]
Four thousand years ago I came back to my senses
Swallowed a laser ray, it blew my mind in all directions
This vertical line, I watch it go by
Chopped down your master plan in nanoseconds, man
I hope you understand that nothing living lasts forever
This vertical line, I watch it go by

[Chorus]
I can feel it overheated
So bad, it makes me want to cry
I can feel it overheated
A burning heart unstuck in time

[Post-Chorus 2]
Well, I heard
From the stars last night
We're only vehicles for light
So, should your mind begin to shine
Say "Hey, alright!" say "I got mine!"
Say "Hey, alright!" say "I got mine!"
Say "Hey, alright!" say "I got mine!"
Say "Hey, alright!" say "I got mine!"
