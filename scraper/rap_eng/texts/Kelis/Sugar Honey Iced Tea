I woke up this mornin' and seen somethin' bright
Was that you?
Then I heard a voice
Sound like birds outside
Was that you?

(Shu-sugar-sugar honey ice-ice-tea)

But I bet you didn't know
You're my sugar honey iced tea, baby
You're just as sweet as can be
Your momma must be made of sugar
Your daddy makes honey
And that's what makes sense to me, oh!

(Shu-sugar-sugar honey ice-ice-tea)

Not sure if I was dreamin' of you and I
Was that true? Oh, I don't know
Smilin' and squeezin' in the bluest sky
Wasn't that true?

(Shu-sugar-sugar honey ice-ice-tea)

But I bet you didn't know
You're my sugar honey iced tea, baby
You're just as sweet as can be
Your momma must be made of sugar
Your daddy makes honey
And that's what makes sense to me, oh!

(Shu-sugar-sugar honey ice-ice-tea)

Open my arms
See my love's a window, it's open for you
Not to hurt you
Actually reverse effects like that in a Tide commercial
We'll be blowin' free in the wind
It's a sunny day, I sip your love and grin

(Shu-sugar-sugar honey ice-ice-tea)

[Pharrell]
(Hold it now...Hold it now)

[REPEAT 3x]
Two steps to my love, baby
Two steps to my love

(Hold it now)

But I bet you didn't know
You're my sugar honey iced tea, baby
You're just as sweet as can be
Your momma must be made of sugar
Your daddy makes honey
And that's what makes sense to me, oh!

Open my arms
See my love's a window, it's open for you
Not to hurt you
Actually reverse effects like that in a Tide commercial
We'll be blowin' free in the wind
It's a sunny day, I sip your love and grin

(Hold it now...H-Hold it now)
