It's a full moon (look in the sky)
Bright as can be (this is one of those nights)
Enough for the whole world to see (I feel amazing)
And the wind's (I feel it) danced with clouds
And the stars shining so nakedly

I said you're something
You're special
You're blessed too and you guide me
You protect me from this cold world
When you hold me and don't let go of me
I said your wings are white they're very wide
That's why you're fly
Yeah Yeah
Baby angel girl
With this world we in you're my cherubin
Yeah Yeah

It's amazing
I can't believe this
It's like a dream

The ocean tugs with god's galaxy (everything's the way it should be)
It's so beautiful when twilight arrives (this is my favorite time)
As I sail n' move with the tides (and nothing in the world matters)
This is what I see when he speaks to me (everytime)

I said you're something special
You're blessed too and you guide me
You protect me from this cold world
When you hold me and don't let go of me
I said your wings are white they're very wide
That's why you're fly
Yeah Yeah
Baby angel girl
With this world we're in
You're my cherubin
Yeah Yeah

I know the phrase far-fetched
Could never seem this far (I love the way you talk to me)
But did I ever tell you you're my shooting star
Warmer than a house
Faster than your car (there's nothing like it)
Did I ever tell you you're my shooting star

It's a cold night
But you would never know (you keep me warm)
And there are more blues than any I could ever see
It's like a melody (like this song) every breath is heavenly
A deep, deep sea
I'm lost completely
When he speaks to me
When you speak to me

Said you're something
You're special
You're blessed too
You guide me (tell me more)
You protect me from this cold world
When you hold me (Yeah)
And don't let go of me
I said your wings are white
They're very wide
That's why you fly
Yeah
Baby angel girl
With this world we're in
You're my cherubin
Yeah Yeah

I love it when you call me that

Something
Special
You're blessed too and you guide me
You protect me (changed my whole world)
Oh you hold me
And don't let go of me (it's like a fantasy)
They're very wide
That's why you fly
With this world we're in
You're my cherubin
Yeah Yeah

Said you're something
You're special
You're blessed too
You guide me
You protect me from this cold world
When you hold me
And won't let go of me
I said your wings are white
They're very wide
That's why you fly
Yeah
Baby angel girl
With this world we're in
You're my cherubin
Yeah Yeah

Hey
Look out the window
It's raining

Rain rain rain rain go away
Would you mind comin' back another day

Rain rain rain rain go away
Would you mind comin' back another day

Rain rain rain rain go away
Would you mind comin' back another day

Rain rain rain rain go away
Would you mind comin' back another day
