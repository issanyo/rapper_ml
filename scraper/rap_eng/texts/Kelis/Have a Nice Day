I'm not really on a hustle
But I must admit I still enjoy the grind
Now traffic doesn't bother me at all
'Cause for once I'm not racing time

Questions I used to ask myself
Answers I needed now
Problems seem so unsolveable
But nothing much bothers me now
Nothing bothers me at all

I'm falling down again
But it seems this time I can't break my fall
But if I hurt myself I'll put my band-aid on
And I'll fall, fall again

Questions I used to ask myself
Answers I needed now
Problems seem so unsolveable
But nothing much bothers me now
Nothing bothers me at all

Nothing's perfect
But today is close as it will ever ever be

Making songs is hard when your happy
No one wants to hear about your lovely, lovely days

But why should I be bothered at all
When everyday I have a ball
Why should I care what you think about my songs
Why would I be bothered by the things you say at all

Told my manager
I had nothing scandalous to say
Told my publicist, "Note this, OK?"
Leave me by the beach today
So I can feel the breeze
And watch the children play

So why would I be bothered at all
When everyday I have a ball
Why should I care what you think about my songs
Why would I be bothered by the things you say at all

No meetings or phone calls
They only plan to catch you
All the words I see
Flying up above of me
Hope they have a very, very, very, very, very
Very nice day
