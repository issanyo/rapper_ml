[Verse 1]
This week seemed it had no end
No time to even call my friends
My sanity this night depends
Meet all the girls and we'll take the Benz

Weekend party starts right now
We're wearing skirts and we're going out
Now it's time to spend the dough
Keepin' low just to go with the flow

[Chorus]
Hey! You! Get off my cloud!
You don't know me and you don't know my style!
La La, La-La-La-La, La La La-La, La-La-La-La
I just came to dance and get wild
Drink with my girls and party for a while
La La, La-La-La-La, La La La-La, La-La-La-La

[Verse 2]
Need to inhale and suck it all in
Get ready y'all 'cause this joints 'bout to spin
The Neptunes laced this beat with a trend
Not sure what this is but it's something sparkling

He's dancing close he's got my body working
I'm feeling good, and I can't help flirting
Bartender just filled his last glass of gin
I think he likes me, Well, at least I'm hoping

[Chorus]

[Hook]
We can dance if you want now baby [x4]
We can leave if it gets too crazy [x4]

[Bridge]
If you don't know what you want
I can show you now baby
I will be your fantasy
You can always count on me

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Hook x2]
