Let's go...

I've been lovin' you for here long knowin' I was never clear
But I have no fear today cause I'm gonna say
What I gotta say, I don't wanna play the role
Bustin' through the door, I'm gonna take your heart fo' sure, oh

Put your hands up in the air, it's a stick up
I'm gon' take your heart from here, now let's fix up
Put your hands in the air, in the air, in the air

I'm gonna play my cards from here
And take this gamble sure;
My words are gonna fumble, but this beat is mighty humble
Ain't goin' nowhere, sure I'm scared but my life's a dare
And baby you just got so much flare, we'll be the perfect pair
I'm gonna share my mind with you, you've been blinded
My life's been blue, I'm takin' you, I'm takin' you

Put your hands up in the air, it's a stick up
I'm gon' take your heart from here, now let's fix up
Put your hands in the air, in the air, in the air

Put your hands up in the air, it's a stick up
I'm gon' take your heart from here, now let's fix up
Put your hands in the air, in the air, in the air
In the air, in the air, in the air

When I first met you, I wanted to wet you
Not a gun but a different content, sexual
You tried to run, I still get you
Steel metal not needed, a whole 'nother meaning
Don't want your gold, want your soul
Control your heartbeatin', 'cause when I start squeezin' that muscle
That's the trigger, then I got you nigga, in ya
Chopper spinners, got your bodyguards wit'cha
Diamond dog tag chain swingin', I had them things ringin'

This is a robbery, no one's gettin free
'Til that man, he comes with me

This is a robbery, no one's gettin' free
'Til that man, he comes with me

Put your hands up in the air, it's a stick up
I'm gon' take your heart from here, now let's fix up
Put your hands in the air, in the air, in the air

In the air, in the air, in the air

Put your hands up in the air, it's a stick up
I'm gon' take your heart from here, now let's fix up
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands...
