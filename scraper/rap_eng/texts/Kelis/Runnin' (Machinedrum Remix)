[Verse 1]
I became a runner
Like a river through your fingers
No one's catching me
We'll count one victory
Best out of the three

[Verse 2]
I became a runner
So they couldn't say she'll never fly
She don't have wings
I didn't need them
'Cause you would push the swing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I became a runner
To escape the fame
I still don't wanna play
A lion will never change

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I became a runner
But I'm not afraid
Probably a big mistake
I never liked the cage

[Hook 1]
How can I forget you?
You're never late, you're always right there at my rescue
How could I reject you?
You are my cave that keeps me safe, you are my refuge

[Verse 3]
I became a runner
Like the words you didn't stutter
Right before the jab
That's not what you meant
Now you lost friend

[Verse 4]
I became a runner
Like the dream that pulled you under
Just before the day
Sure, that's all that's left
Better than regret
Let's go

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I became a runner
Need a shoe built to last
So I can speed by the past
And never face the facts

[Pre-Chorus 4]
I became a runner
Oh I, I became a runner
Oh I, I became a runner
Oh I, I became a runner

[Hook 2]
How can I forget you?
You're never late, you're always right there at my rescue
How could I reject you?
You are my cave that keeps me safe, you are my refuge
Keep your heads up

[Post-Hook]
How can I forget, how can I forget, how can I forget, how can I forget?
How can I forget, how can I forget, how can I forget, how can I forget you?
Let's go
You're never late, you're always right there at my rescue
You are my cave that keeps me safe, you are my refuge

[Bridge]
Fear beats me to the punch
And my heart would know
So I begin to run
So fast, and I don't feel my feet
I'm going in circles
And I can't seem to reach your hand

[Hook 1]
How can I forget you?
You're never late, you're always right there at my rescue
How could I reject you?
You are my cave that keeps me safe, you are my refuge

[Hook 1]
How can I forget you?
You're never late, you're always right there at my rescue
How could I reject you?
You are my cave that keeps me safe, you are my refuge
