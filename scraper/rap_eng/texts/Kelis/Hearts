[Verse 1: Dan Black]
Call paramedics and other experts
Could I be re-fixed?
All these broken people, they trunk your parts
Somewhere we got missed

[Chorus: Dan Black]
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps

[Verse 2: Kelis]
Call paramedics and other experts
Listen close to this
Broken people, their junkyard parts
They can all be fixed

[Chorus: Kelis]
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps

[Bridge: Both]
We’ll put out an APB
Crash carts on the way

[Chorus: Both]
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps
‘Cause the heart, it never sleeps
