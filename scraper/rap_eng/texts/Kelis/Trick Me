[Intro]
Wooo
This is It Yeah
Wooo

[Verse 1]
Said I've paid my dues for all that i've done
And I showed you that I loved you more than once
Theres nothing left there to decide
Said you might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice
Freedom to us has always been a trick
Freedom to you has always been who ever landed on your dick
Seen it in your one to many times
Said you might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice no

[Hook]
Might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice
Might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice no
Might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice
No I won't let you trick me twice

[Verse 2]
Those days are old and overdone
And it's only cause i'm not with you that you make me number one
Though I may love you
It hurts me deep inside Oh
Now you no longer have to hide

[Verse 3]
I used to be down with the late night hit
Started gettin' heavy when I really wasn't ready
Used my class to get in my mind
So I fell for your lies like all the time
I thought you were the shit to be playin around
Call the police there's a mad girl in town
Couldn't get even here without a sound
It's not how I wanna get down Yeah You

[Hook]
Might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice
Might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice no
Might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice
No I won't let you trick me twice

[Verse 4]
And I've paid all my dues for what i've done
And I showed you that I love you more than once
Theres nothing left there to decide
Ooh Trick me I won't let your trick me twice
You might trick me once
No I won't let me trick you twice no
You might trick me once
No I won't let me trick you twice
Woooo
