[Break: Alex Clare]
I'mma give it all, I don't give a damn if I fall
They told me that I shouldn't abuse it
But I say life is too short
Live fast, die young

I'mma give it all, I don't give a damn if I fall
So let's all raise our glasses
Like we don't know the fuck what for
Live fast, die young

[Pre-Drop: Alex Clare, Don Diablo & CID]
I'mma give it all
Live fast, die young
I'mma give it all
Live fast, die young

I'mma give it all
Live fast, die young
I'mma give it all
Live fast (Never take it slow)

[Drop: Don Diablo & CID]
Never take it slow
Never take it slow

[Breakdown: Kelis]
All or nothing, I can give without regret
At least that's one look daddy always had
All the world's a stage, so baby break a leg
Couple on the show that no one can forget

[Post-Breakdown: Alex Clare]
I'mma give it all, I don't give a damn if I fall

But I say life is too short
Live fast, die young

I'mma give it all, I don't give a damn if I fall
So let's all raise our glasses
Like we don't know the fuck what for
Live fast, die young

[Pre-Drop: Alex Clare, Don Diablo & CID]
I'mma give it all
Live fast, die young
I'mma give it all
Live fast, die young

I'mma give it all, all, all...
