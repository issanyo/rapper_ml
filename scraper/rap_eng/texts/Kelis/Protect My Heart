I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart

You were the highlight of the spot
But you wouldn't tell me your name
You were like
Girl you ready or not
To dance the entire night away
You and I

Let me hold you girl, hold you girl
You were sayin'
Let me touch it girl
You were sayin'
Let me squeeze you girl, squeeze you girl
You turned me on
Let me... you girl

So when I first got here I knew love barely
I gotta protect my heart
And then you come change things, I knew that's unfair babe
I gotta protect my heart

The room is oh so hot
If you want more than that then walk away
I'm givin' it all I got
And at the same time tryin' to maintain

You were like
Let me hold you girl, hold you girl
You were sayin'
Let me touch it girl
You were sayin'
Let me squeeze you girl, squeeze you girl
You turned me on
Let me... you girl

So when I first got here I knew love barely
I gotta protect my heart
And then you come change things, I knew that's unfair babe
I gotta protect my heart
Never been touched by the way someone moves and that scares me
I gotta protect my heart
Cupid knew you were comin', he should've prepared me
I gotta protect my heart

I just need ta
I walked away from the door
I could feel myself reversing
I never gave in before
See I guess that's what happens
When you were like

Let me hold you girl, hold you girl
You were sayin'
Let me touch it girl
You were sayin'
Let me squeeze you girl, squeeze you girl
You turned me on
Let me... you girl

So when I first got here, I knew love barely
I gotta protect my heart
And then you come change things, I knew that's unfair babe
I gotta protect my heart
Never been touched by the way someone moves and that scares me
I gotta protect my heart
Cupid knew you were comin', he should've prepared me
I gotta protect my heart

Break it down

See when I first got here I knew love barely
I gotta protect my heart
And then you come change things, I knew that's unfair babe
I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart
