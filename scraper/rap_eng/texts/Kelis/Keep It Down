Hey, whatcha know
Outside of the Beastie Boys show
Saw a phat kid that tried to get with me
He said by the way where ya been
Are you still wit' that boyfriend
I said no with an evil grin
Wanna hook up, but I thought again

Met him on the train one day
When I was wrapped in pain
He said I love you
In more ways than I've ever heard
And before I got his name I thought that it might be okay
To use for service to take some pain away

I know guys that talk around town
Girls like me wanna keep it down
Dope boy fresh with all your clothes
Pop that girl if anything goes
Yeah B-boys want all the fame
Girls get hurt when you play that game
You weren't concerned in how I feel
No thank you I'd rather chill

Hey, what's the deal
I'll let you know if things get ill
Can't hook up when you call the shots on me
But ya got things that I'd like to see
Soft porn doesn't do it for me
I don't like sex and drugs with me
I don't like sex and drugs with me

And one day on the train
I'd never lead my man astray
I don't deserve this
In more ways than I've ever heard
But instead of being scared
His words just went straight to my head
And I got nervous and left my love away

I know guys that talk around town
Girls like me wanna keep it down
Dope boy fresh with all your clothes
Pop that girl if anything goes
Yeah B-boys want all the fame
Girls get hurt when you play that game
You weren't concerned in how I feel
No thank you I'd rather chill
I know guys that talk around town
Girls like me wanna keep it down
Dope boy fresh with all your clothes
Pop that girl if anything goes
Yeah B-boys want all the fame
Girls get hurt when you play that game
You weren't concerned in how I feel
No thank you I'd rather chill
