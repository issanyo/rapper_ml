Earth to your brain
Yo yo yo yo
Yo yo houston I think we have a problem
Yo yo I think we have a problem
Yo yo we have a problem
Yo yo

Days you know those days
When everyone seems to aggravate you
And face fucked up ways
Don't try to ignore you know that it's true
So you say to yourself that you really don't wanna deal
And this day to day action on earth just don't appeal

You know how hard you try
You've can only  take so much
They shoot at you cause you're fine
Bite the bullet I know that it sucks
If security's there then faith will pull you through
If you still angry follow me
And do what I do

Do you hear what I'm talking 'bout
Do you hear we can conquer the world
Got this whole world running from
This love between a boy and a girl
They're afraid of this chemistry
Plus the speed of light of laser guns
They go laser sounds
To the light in every one

There you want some friends
Seems like everybody has some
Depends on what you call friends
You don't really care you just want one
It's a person full of feelings but nobody's there
But you have to ask yourself if they were
Would they really care
They do bullshit some times
They do the things that you've done
They're people just like you
But tell me do you really want one
98 percent of faith won't follow through
Don't you know real magic comes from the other two

Do you hear what I'm talking 'bout
Do you hear we can conquer the world
Got this whole world running from
This love between a boy and a girl
They're afraid of this chemistry
Plus the speed of light of laser guns
They go laser sounds
To the light in every one

Do you hear what I'm talking 'bout
Do you hear we can conquer the world
Got this whole world running from
This love between a boy and a girl
They're afraid of this chemistry
Plus the speed of light of laser guns
They go laser sounds
To the light in every one

It was last week we were watching tv
My boyfriend wanted to watch channel three
Then he started to freak
The news flash came on then
So I said hey my popcorn's burning
Hey why is the channel turning
Hey that was nasa what did they want
Hey yo just pass the blunt
I was so high that I didn't realize what they said
Plus my eye vision fried
If it's not then it's messing with my head
Hey you can't be serious
Hey but I need my chronic
Hey float and spin
Hey so I turned and I said shit

Do you hear what they talking 'bout
About to send your black ass to mars
That's exactly what I'm talkin' bout
Money science space and mars
Till someday you got that million
Just because you've been hanging with stars
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
And send your black ass to mars

Do you hear what I'm talking 'bout
Do you hear we can conquer the world
Got this whole world running from
This love between a boy and a girl
They're afraid of this chemistry
Plus the speed of light of laser guns
They go laser sounds
To the light in every one
