I know that life has dealt us many cards
Sometimes I swear he's trying to make it hard
And I don't want to have to hide my faults
But he got busy, and let down the gaurds

I need attention from you
It's just the little things we do
Pay attention, it's on you
'Cause I can't help it, I just like it when you do, yeah

I don't wanna nag and start a fight
But sometimes you forget and I get tired
If he was out of sight and out of mind
So darlin' listen now, just make it right

I need attention from you
It's just the little things we do
Pay attention, it's on you
'Cause I can't help it, I just like it when you do, yeah

You make my heart monsoon baby
And we could make life through baby
So take my hand and we'll glide away

I need attention from you
It's just the little things we do
Pay attention, it's on you
'Cause I can't help it, I just like it when you do, yeah

Would you follow now?
Just look me in the eyes
Remember what makes me smile
You used to make me high
Let's go way back in time
Come baby lay me down

I need attention from you
It's just the little things we do
Pay attention, it's on you
'Cause I can't help it, I just like it when you do, yeah
