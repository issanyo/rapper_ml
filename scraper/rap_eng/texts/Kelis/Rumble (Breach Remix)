(You, no...)

Have you back in my face
With all those years passed
I just got used to my space

I don't know how to feel
This whole thing seems so surreal

We've got so much history
I hurt you, I hurt you
I hurt you, I hurt you
You hurt me

No, we don't need therapy
What I need is you here

I'm so glad you give back my keys...

Have you back in my face
With all those years passed
I just got used to my space

I don't know how to feel
This whole thing seems so surreal

We've got so much history
I hurt you, I hurt you
I hurt you, I hurt you
Xou hurt me

No, we don't need therapy
What I need is you here

I'm so glad you give back my keys...

Baby, don't go...
