Didn't think I needed you
Never seemed to
But I'm living proof
Now I'm brand new
Rename me
Baby claim me

I'm in dream see
You make me hover
You make me hover
Didn't think I'd need you
Never seemed to
But I'm living proof

Nothing I'll ever say or do
Will be as good as loving you
Nothing I'll ever say or do
Will be as good as loving you
Nothing I'll ever say or do
Will be as good as loving you
Nothing I'll ever say or do
Will be as good as loving you
You make me high
You make me high
You make me high (and I don't want to come down)
You make me high (I don't want to come down)
You make me high (and I don't want to come down)
You make me high (I don't want to come down)
You make me

Didn't think I needed you
Never seemed to
But I'm living proof
And now I'm brand new
Rename me
Baby claim me

I'm in dream see
You make me hover
You make me hover
Didn't think I'd need you
Never seemed to
But I'm living proof, living proof

Didn't think I needed you
Never seemed to
But I'm living proof
And now I'm brand new
Rename me
Baby claim me

I'm in dream see
You make me hover
You make me hover
Didn't think I'd need you
Never seemed to
But I'm living proof, living proof

Nothing I'll ever say or do
