Waoaoo
This is it
Yeah
Waoaoo

Said I've paid my dues for all that I've done
And I showed you that I loved you more than once
There's nothing left there to decide
Said you might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice
Freedom to us has always been a trick
Freedom to you has always been whoever landed on your dick
Seen it in you one too many times
Said you might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice, no

Might trick me once (Waoaoo)
I won't let you trick me twice
Might trick me once (Waoaoo)
I won't let you trick me twice, no
Might trick me once (Waoaoo)
I won't let you trick me twice
(Waoaoo)
No I won't let you trick me twice

Those days are old and overdone
And it's only cause I'm not with you that you make me number one
Though I may love you, it hurts me deep inside, yeah
Now you no longer have to hide

I used to be down with the late night hit
Started gettin' heavy when I really wasn't ready
Used my past to get my mind
So I fell for your lies like all the time
I thought you were the shit to be playin' around
Call the police, there's a mad girl in town
Couldn't get even here without a sound
It's not how I wanna get down, yeah (You)

Might trick me once (Waoaoo)
I won't let you trick me twice
Might trick me once (Waoaoo)
I won't let you trick me twice, no
Might trick me once (Waoaoo)
I won't let you trick me twice
(Waoaoo)
No I won't let you trick me twice
No I won't let you trick me twice

Well I've paid my dues for all that I've done
And I showed you that I loved you more than once
There's nothing left there to decide
Uh, trick me, I won't let you trick me twice
You might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice
You might trick me once (Waoaoo) No I won't let you trick me twice, no
(Waoaoo) You might trick me once, no I won't let you trick me twice

Waoaoo
Peace
