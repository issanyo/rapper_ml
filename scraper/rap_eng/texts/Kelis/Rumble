[Verse 1]
It's the strangest thing
To have you back in my face
With all those years passed
I guess I just got used to my space

[Verse 2]
I don't know how to feel
This whole thing seems so surreal
So, you keep one foot out the door
I know I said, "Leave," but, baby, don't go

[Verse 3]
We got so much history
I hurt you, you hurt me
No, we don't need therapy
What I need is you to leave

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And even though I know I'm right
Just like some lapse in my memory
You're back to me, hand on the door
I wanna yell, "Baby, don't go!"

[Chorus]
I'm so glad you gave back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you gave back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you gave back my keys, my keys

[Verse 4]
You got so many issues
But I guess something's up with me too
I'm just fine by myself
But I don't know who's gonna help you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm not no secretary
I'm nobody's ma√Ætre d'
But like a lapse in my memory
I wanna yell, oh, "Baby, don't go!"

[Interlude]
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go
Baby, don't leave yet
Stay the night, baby
Don't go, baby, oh, hey, baby, don't, oh, baby, don't go

[Chorus]
I'm so glad you gave back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you gave back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you gave back my keys, my keys

[Chorus]
I'm so glad you gave back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you gave back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you gave back my keys, my keys
