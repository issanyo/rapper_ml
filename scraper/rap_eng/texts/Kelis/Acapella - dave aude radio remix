I was walking, was living
My melody was acapella
There's a beat I was missing
No tune, or a scale, I could play
The sound in the distance
No orchestra playing together
Like a boat out to sea
The silence was too deafening
So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

(Chorus)
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Everything was the same
One color was just like the others
An assembly routine
My memories were all black and white
Till I stopped over-thinking
Decided to draw back the curtains
And I cleared all the cobwebs
And began to let in the light
So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

(Chorus)
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing

(Bridge – 3X)
You are the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away

(Chorus – 2X)
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
