[Nas]
Alright, are you sure

[Kelis]
Yeah, I'm sure
So wait, you're telling me there's no-
You can't think of anybody
In your past, in your dirty dark crazy past (Nas laugh)
So if I gave you a free pass, you wouldn't wanna do them just one last time

[Nas]
No

[Kelis]
Come on

[Nas]
No

[Kelis]
I don't believe you, all them-
All them bitches?
I'm serious, okay I'm saying you have
Before we get married you have one free pass
I don't need to know about it

[Nas]
Mhm...

[Kelis]
But it's one girl, there's one girl that you had in the past that you could say
"You know what? Let me hit that one more time"

[Nas]
Ah, I can't really think of nobody
Definitely ain't nobody 'cause I've been there, done that
You know, let me go through it
