I see the way you look at me
It's not the Hennessey
Cuz you're feeling me
But instead you're acting scared
Don't be afraid of me
Let's not be cowardly

Keep in mind boy
It's easy come and easy go
Keep in mind boy
It's easy come and easy go

Is it my girls 'round me
Or is my job heavy
Come baby talk to me
Maybe from caught out there
Don't tell me it's my hair
Come on now let's play fair

Keep in mind boy
It's easy come and easy go
Keep in mind boy
It's easy come and easy go
Keep in mind boy
It's easy come and easy go

Instead I get Mr. crazy
Yeah he's comin' see
With the guts to say to me
He thinks that him n' me
Should go and have babies
(Yeah right)
I wish you'd come and save me

Keep in mind boy

Keep in mind boy

Keep in mind boy
It's easy come and easy go
Keep in mind boy
It's easy come and easy go
Keep in mind boy
It's easy come and easy go
