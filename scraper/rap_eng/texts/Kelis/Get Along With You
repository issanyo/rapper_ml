[Verse 1]
Don't need no paper
Don't need no pencils
Don't need no love letters
'Cause I just wanna get along with you
No beeper, don't need no cellular
Though Digital's better, listen
I just wanna get along with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Try me 'cause I'd be
The one that makes you happy
But the part that I don't get is
Why me? You deny me
Now I'm forced to roam this planet
Sadly, lonely like some loose spigot

[Chorus]
You took my heartbeat from me
This is the saddest story
What was wrong with my love?
You took my heartbeat from me
Was it I loved you poorly?
Whatever it was, I just wanna get along with you

[Verse 2]
Don't need no car
Don't need no truck
Don't need no vehicles
'Cause I just wanna get along with you
No planes, don't need no trains
Don't need to be passenger
Cause I just wanna get along with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Try me 'cause I'd be
The one that makes you happy
But the part that I don't get is
Why me? You deny me
Now I'm forced to roam this planet
Sadly, lonely like some loose spigot

[Chorus]
You took my heartbeat from me
This is the saddest story
What was wrong with my love?
You took my heartbeat from me
Was it I loved you poorly?
Whatever it was, I just wanna get along with you

[Verse 3]
Don't need these clothes
Don't need this house
Don't need this land or skies
Cause I just wanna get along with you
These eyes, don't need these thighs
As a matter of fact this damn life
Cause I just wanna get along with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Try me 'cause I'd be
The one that makes you happy
But the part that I don't get is
Why me? You deny me
Now I'm forced to roam this planet
Sadly, lonely like some loose spigot

[Chorus]
You took my heartbeat from me
This is the saddest story
What was wrong with my love?
You took my heartbeat from me
Should have just stabbed it for me
From ashes to dust
I just wanna get along with you

[Interlude]
Dear diary
I remember like it was yesterday
It was October 30
I no longer have any need for these worldly things
I wanna go where he is
I'll follow the fire in the sky
And like that I'll be gone

[Chorus]
You took my heartbeat from me
This is the saddest story
What was wrong with my love?
You took my heartbeat from me
Should have just stabbed it for me
From ashes to dust, I just wanna get along with you

[Outro Chorus]
You took my heartbeat from me
This is the saddest story
You took my heartbeat from me
Should have just stabbed it for me
