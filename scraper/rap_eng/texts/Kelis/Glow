There's a wild streak in me
But it's only for you to see
Look to my heart, cause you know I'm ready to start
I guess I'm tryin' to say, yes I've been waiting for this very day
Hope you're goin' to slow, cause we're about to shoot the sun a-glow

How did we make it, I do know
If there was ever a problem they had to go
Sometimes it's kinda hard yes I do agree
See one plus you just equals me
They'll just watch us glow, they'll just watch us glow

Now in love something crazed
Exude from your eyes when they are fixed on me and like the eternal flame
We have a fire that won't ever stop burning
There's a power in numbers baby
But two is deemed the perfect team
Me and you equals two
We will battle the masses baby, but we will claim the victory

How did we make it, I do know
If there was ever a problem they had to go
Sometimes it's kinda hard yes I do agree
See one plus you just equals me
They'll just watch us glow, they'll just watch us glow

Some said we would never change
Look at us now, people tried to tear it all apart
Boy you stole my heart so quickly

How did we make it, I do know
If there was ever a problem they had to go
Sometimes it's kinda hard yes I do agree
See one plus you just equals me
They'll just watch us glow, they'll just watch us glow
