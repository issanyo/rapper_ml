[Intro: Enrique Iglesias and Kelis]
Are you ready?
(Born ready)
Let's go

[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias]
You call me on the phone
I act like nothing's going on
We're driving in my car
I pretend that you don't turn me on

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias and Kelis]
(Ah, ah, ah) you sexy thing
Yeah, you know it, yeah
(Ah, ah, ah) you move around now you show it

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
I'm not in love
It's just a phase that I'm going through
I'm always looking for something new
But don't go running away

[Verse 2: Kelis and Enrique Iglesias]
I know you're not the one
But I can tell that this is going to be fun
I won't hesitate a lie
But I can show you how to feel inside
(So show me how to feel)

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias and Kelis]
(Ah, ah, ah) you sexy thing
Yeah, you know it, yeah
(Ah, ah, ah) you move around now you show it

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
I'm not in love
It's just a phase that I'm going through
I'm always looking for something new
But don't go running away

[Verse 3: Enrique Iglesias and Kelis]
Oh, I'm not in love
I try to tell myself all the time
I just can't help how I feel tonight
So don't go running away, yeah, ooh
I'm not in love (I think I need your heart)
I'm not in love (ooh, tell me sometime)
I'm not in love (just run away with me)
I'm not in love (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias and Kelis]
Ah, ah, ah, you sexy thing
Yeah, you know it
(Do you want to come by with me)
Ah, ah, ah, you move around now you show it
(But you can't spend the night with me)

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
I'm not in love
It's just a phase that I'm going through
I'm always looking for something new
But don't go running away

[Outro: Enrique Iglesias and Kelis]
Oh, I'm not in love
I try to tell myself all the time
I just can't help how I feel tonight
So don't go running away
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
No no no no no no
I'm not in love
No no no no no no
I'm not in love
Oh no
No no no no no no
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
