[Verse 1]
These are the days in your life
When the price of time is free
Like your daddy said the world is yours
So let it flow naturally

[Verse 2]
All the season's changes
Escort them with a kiss
You welcome all life's tricks
So eat the peach, spit out the pit

[Verse 3]
Never forget when our eyes first met
The way it felt to me, we were in harmony
The day I lost the bet
We were reckless, but so precise
That baby's joy the one thing we did right, right

[Verse 4]
So look alive
We got a front row seat
It's only you and me
And that's alright with me

[Verse 5]
If you're ever blue
Well, take a look around
I belong to you
And that's the truth
