[Intro]
Let me tell you what love is
It's when you meet each other halfway
I'm en route

[Chorus]
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

[Verse 1]
Look in your own mirror and know who you are
Live your life accordingly the truth is on your arm
And it's good, baby
You've done good, baby
Be just who you are make no apologies
And when it's said and done who's really sorry
You're okay, baby
It's okay, baby

[Chorus]
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

[Verse 2]
Dare to be a better you each chance you get
We're all human and fall short and nothing's over yet
It's up to you, baby
Give 'em you, baby
Life's too short to waste your time do what you love
Don't be ashamed it's better have peace by a dove
Give 'em you, baby
Give 'em room, baby

[Bridge]
Like the phoenix from the ashes
Or a sunrise off in the distance
I'll try again, I'll try again
I'll try again, we'll try again
Like the phoenix from the ashes
Or a sunrise off in the distance
I'll try again, I'll try again
I'll try again, we'll try again

[Chorus]
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
