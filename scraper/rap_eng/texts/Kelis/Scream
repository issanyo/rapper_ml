Been running in place for such a long time
Stuck in a race in the wrong line
When it all came down on me
And I haven't had faith for such a long time
Am I outta place or out of my mind
Should it all fall down on me

It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to sing so just scream

You'll never know
If you don't let it out
You've had enough
They'll call your bluff
You can't back down lost in a crowd
You've won the right to scream and shout
They'll talk about you lost your cool
There is no point who makes the rules
So let's get to it
Now you'll prove it
Break out

Scream and shout
Scream and shout
Scream and shout
Scream and shout

Been running in place for such a long time
Stuck in a race in the wrong line
When it all came down on me
And I haven't had faith for such a long time
Am I outta place or out of my mind
Should it all fall down on me

It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to sing so just scream

Sound the alarm
Raise your arms
Your on your own
Your not alone
Big city got you on the ground
Afraid to fight don't make a sound
So lets get to it
Now you'll prove it
Push back

Scream and shout
Scream and shout
Scream and shout
Scream and shout

Been running in place for such a long time
Stuck in a race in the wrong line
When it all came down on me
And I haven't had faith for such a long time
Am I outta place or out of my mind
Should it all fall down on me

It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to sing so just scream
