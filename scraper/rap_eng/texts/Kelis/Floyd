[Verse 1]
Seems like no one is surprising anymore
It's not that I'm ungrateful, I'm just a little bored
Sure, I'm self sufficient, blah blah, independent
Truthfully I've got some space, I want that man to fill it

[Verse 2]
Don't need another friend, let's say for instance
And as a rule, I don't believe, don't do long distance
So, I'm looking for a sailor, or an arson expert
Someone I can tell them, say

[Chorus]
I want to be blown away
Blow me away
I want to be blown away

[Chorus]
I want to be blown away
Blow me away
I want to be blown away

[Verse 3]
I know that I don't look it, but I can cook;
I'm really pretty simple, I like what I should
You'd think it be really easy, if it was, I would
But people seem too crazy, so I read a book

[Verse 4]
I don't want to send a search party
If he's smart, I can wait, and he'll find me
So for now, I'll just say what I'm lookin' for
One more time

[Chorus]
I want to be blown away
Blow me away
I want to be blown away

[Chorus]
I want to be blown away
Blow me away
I want to be blown away

[Post-Chorus]
Boom, bang, bang, boom
Boom, bang, bang, boom
Blow me away
Boom, bang, bang, boom
I want to be blown away
