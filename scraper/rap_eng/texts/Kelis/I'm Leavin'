Is it, I loose my cool, every once in a blue moon
Leave a girl stranded in a hotel room
Cuz ain't nothin' worse then flirtin' and teasin'
Trynna lift the skirt (I'm a virgin) I'm leavin'
You a virgin? You know you do this often
You're thing is so deep you can drown a school of dogs in
It's like every M.C., she done did it
Redman tapped, Lil' Weezy done hit it
Even them Boys from the Beastie done did it
Lil' Cease and R&B singers split it
Rumor has it from word of mouth
That ya thing's more dirtier than the dirty south
And I keep model chicks screamin' out, he a dog
Bust his ears hard, now she look like Nia Long
So, cute girls come jump in my ride
And all you buffalo gals go round the outside

[Hook: Kelis]
I'm leavin, I think I'll take the plane
It's the same, and nothing's ever changed
Sorry, beggin' you, I'll blow the range
Since we be owed to you, was actin' strange
I, never thought that I
Could ever be wit such a guy
Would always cheat and lie

[Pacewon]
She fell in love wit a star, the life, the car
The "HUH, HUH, HAH!!"
Open like what wit a butt like Kim
When I seen it, it made me wanna nut right then
Yo, we got fly, we talked, she stopped bye
Lit the choc' lye, and passed it clockwise
Let me knock the boots, til I was cock-eyed
And now she trynna act like she ain't got time
I told her, think of this before you try to be foul
There's ladies at the bar that could be buyin' me rounds
And all type models that be eyein' me down
I stay and you say good-bye to me now?
Fuck that, diss me, that's what's up here
You better get ya fat ass back up stairs
And if you try to creep, I'mma tie you in the basement
Catch ya little boyfriend and beat his little face in

[Hook: Kelis]
I'm leavin, I think I'll take the plane
It's the same, and nothing's ever changed
Sorry, beggin' you, I'll blow the range
Since we be owed to you, was actin' strange
I, never thought that I
Could ever be wit such a guy
Would always cheat and lie

[Rah Digga]
Now all my sisters in the place
No matter what the race, we share a common cause
Everything be everything, get treated like a queen
Til we give up the drawers
Now just when I thought, everything was cool
Let a brother even have a key
I said I let him use the car, then he took it too far
Brother out there cheatin' on me
Time to face the truth, when I really didn't want to
How the hell all these hoes keep gettin' my number?
Who was it? A distant cousin, came to see you
In prison, they said you already had a visit
Beefin' wit these strangers, how do you explain this?
Came this close to lettin' you put it in my anus
Wakin' up, middle of the night, brother out
Time to get the steppin', back to ya mother house, boy
I'm leavin'
