[Verse 1]
Plans change like the weather, to prepare, bring a sweater
Either way, you'll be cold if it snows
Everybody wonders where to get the answers
Silly thought to think the answer knows where to go
The push up stream thought used to seem like a really good idea
But survey says, "Better leave well enough alone."

[Chorus 1]
Not everyone believes the story
As for me, I love the truth
And ever since I was a young girl
Witnessed evidence and proof

[Verse 2]
I'm standing in the middle of some other person's life
The funny part about that is, I'm sure these are my highs
I don't where I'm going, quite a story, where I've been
My map seems all wrong, and my compass says the end
If it's already written, then my script can be forgiven
Doesn't matter where I thought I'd be, time to relish what I'm in

[Chorus 1]
Not everyone believes the story
As for me, I love the truth
And ever since I was a young girl
Witnessed evidence and proof

[Chorus 2]
Been given a morning;
Every dawn brings thoughts of you;
By this time tomorrow, I'll be brand new

[Chorus 3]
Been given a morning;
Every dawn brings thoughts of you;
If you catch me tomorrow, I'll be renewed

[Chorus 2]
Been given a morning;
Every dawn brings thoughts of you;
By this time tomorrow, I'll be brand new

[Interlude]
Been given a morning, been given a morning
Been given a morning, been given a morning
Been given a morning, been given a morning
Been given a morning, thoughts of you

[Chorus 2]
Been given a morning;
Every dawn brings thoughts of you;
By this time tomorrow, I'll be brand new
