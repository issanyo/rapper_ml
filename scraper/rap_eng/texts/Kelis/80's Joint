Forget about the neighbors
We're doing them a favor
I can't wait tonight

Forget about the neighbors
We're doing them a favor
I can't wait tonight

Don't make me wait for your lovin'
Don't make me wait for your lovin'

I like to tease
And, boy, it seems like you can read my mind
Let me show you
And I promise you will have fun with me
This is not a test
So, playboy, come and give your best
Come on, baby
I just hope you can make it last

'Cause
Don't make me wait for your lovin'
Don't make me wait for your lovin'
Don't make me wait for your lovin'
Don't make me wait for your lovin'

Baby, know me while
I just wanna give you all me time
Boys are waiting up the block in line
You're the one I can't get out my head
You're so cute, the way you said
That you want it

Don't make me wait for your lovin'
Don't make me wait for your lovin'
Don't make me wait for your lovin'
Don't make me wait for your lovin'
