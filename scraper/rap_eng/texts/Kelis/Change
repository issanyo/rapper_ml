[Verse 1]
Sleep well my friend
You must be tired
I wouldn't blame myself
I'm different

[Verse 2]
Now don't be foolish
No one keeps their promise
How could you know?
When I would be so

[Chorus 1]
You can't escape the grips of desire;
You lie to yourself, but you'll always remember

[Verse 3]
Your love stung like a bee
Keep that stuff away from me, use caution
Shouldn't I forgive him? I would know
Don't wanna let it grow like poison

[Verse 4]
Now don't be silly
No one clears their conscience
Blown out proportion
Silly me, I cried, for weeks, an ocean

[Chorus 1]
You can't escape the grips of desire;
You lie to yourself, but you'll always remember

[Bridge]
What can I say? Nothing can change

[Chorus 1]
You can't escape the grips of desire;
You lie to yourself, but you'll always remember

[Chorus 2]
You can't escape the grips of desire;
And you lose yourself
Then you lose yourself
Can't forgive yourself, oh no
