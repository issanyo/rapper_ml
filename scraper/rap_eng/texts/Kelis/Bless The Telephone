[Verse 1]
It's nice to hear your voice again
I've waited all day long
Even wrote a song for you
It's strange the way you make me feel
With just a word or two
I'd like to do the same for you

[Verse 2]
It's nice to hear you say, "Hello,"
And, "How are things with you?
I love you."
But very soon it's time to go
An office job to do
While I'm here writing songs for you

[Chorus 1]
Strange how a phone call can change your day
Take you away
Away from the feeling of being alone
Bless the telephone

[Verse 3]
It's nice the way you say my name
Not very fast or slow, just soft and low
The same as when you tell me how you feel
I feel the same way too
I'm very much in love with you

[Chorus 2]
Strange how a phone call can change your day
Take you away
Away from the feeling of being alone
Bless the telephone
Bless the telephone
