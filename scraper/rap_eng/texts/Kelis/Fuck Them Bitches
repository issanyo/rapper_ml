I ain't one to spark shit
But this is dedicated to them bitches who talk shit
They wanna run their damn lips
But all they really want is some more attention
Fuck them bitches - Fuck them bitches
That's right I said it - That's right I said it

Walkin' down theâ€¦Walkin' down theâ€¦Walkin' down theâ€¦Walkin' down theâ€¦
Walkin' down the hallway, lookin' at chickens
Talkin' mad shit but they don't wanna listen
Listen, why y'all trippin'?
I don't wanna fight but you lookin' for a whippin' (ooh)

Keep talkin' that shit! You keep talkin' that shit (keep talkin')
What ya gonna do? (What ya gon' do) What ya gonna do?

I heard you was sayin' this and that about me and so-and-so
And how we did this and that
But I don't really like you talkin' shit behind my back
And if you don't stop, you might catch a little *what!*

Keep talkin' that shit! You keep talkin' that shit (keep talkin')
What ya gon' do? (What ya gon' do) What ya gon' do?

I don't really like you talkin' about me
Sayin' this and that when you don't know me
I don't really like you talkin' about me
Sayin' this and that when you don't know me

What ya gon' do? (What ya gon' do) What ya gon' do?
(What! What! What! What! What! What!)
