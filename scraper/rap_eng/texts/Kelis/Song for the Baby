So I'm writing this letter to you baby
Just like my mother told me
She always said say yes before you say no and say maybe

See I'll never sugar coat any of life lessons for you
Cause I want to make you equipped for the best
And I can't always be here to rescue you when life get's crazy
But I love you more than you'll ever know
With you love never dies
With you love never dies
Cause I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know

No I can not promise to have all the answers to all of your questions
But I'll never lie and I'll raise you with love
And not an obsession

See I'll never sugar coat any of life lessons for you
Cause I want to make you equipped for the best
And I can't always be here to rescue you when life get's crazy
But I love you more than you'll ever know
With you love never dies
With you love never dies
Cause I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know

You can do it if you try
You can do it if you try
You can do it if you try try
You can do it if you try
You can do it if you try
You can do it if you try
You can do it if you try try
You can do it if you try
