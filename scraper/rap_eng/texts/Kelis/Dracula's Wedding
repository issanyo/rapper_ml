[Verse 1: André 3000]
You're all I've ever wanted, but I'm terrified of you
See, my castle may be haunted, but I'm terrified of you
I've cast my spell on millions, but I'm terrified of you
Baby, I do this from the ceiling, but I'm terrified of you

[Chorus: André 3000]
I wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened
Ooh, Dracula's wedding

[Verse 2: André 3000]
I've never ran from no one, but I'm terrified of you
See, my heartbeat is a slow one, but I'm terrified of you
I've been around for ages, but I'm terrified of you
Done my thang across the stage, but yet I’m terrified of you

[Chorus: André 3000]
I wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened
Ooh, Dracula's wedding

[Post-Chorus: André 3000 & Kelis]
Ah, you know I'm terrified
Oh, you know I'm terrified
You know I'm terrified
Shh-shh! Here she comes
Three-thousand, three-thousand
Three-thousand, three-thousand

[Verse 3: Kelis]
Give me the chance to dance romance
Don't run, I'm not the sun
So much at stake, oh, bad choice of words
But I'm not the gun (shut up) with silver bullets
And I can count (two, three), plus I make great peanut butter
And jelly sandwiches, Van Helsing

[Outro: Kelis]
For richer or poorer
Through sickness and in health
'Til death do us part
'Til death do us part
You only live once
Well, not in our case
'Cause we live forever
