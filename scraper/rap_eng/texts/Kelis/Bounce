[Intro: Kelis]
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce

[Verse 1: Kelis]
I can't believe it, every day and every night
Is gettin' better with you out of my life
It's like I flicked a switch, and now I'm feeling good
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes, I know I feel alive
You will be the last thing on my mind
No regrets, do you know what that means?

[Refrain: Kelis]
Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We'll bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that

[Verse 2: Kelis]
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
I can love again tonight
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

[Breakdown: Kelis]
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce

[Refrain: Kelis]
Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We'll bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I don't care what anybody thinks about that
