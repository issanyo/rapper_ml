Last night we were watching this game show
They were talking 'bout marriage
And that stuff you know
I found myself laughing
Cause those couples weren't clear
And then here he comes with this bright idea
So I said to him

I know you mean well
You're genuine I can tell
Besides you and me
I know that we would soar
But are you ready?
You gotta be sure, you gotta be sure

Oh no, I know you got the feeling, hold on
Baby, you're price ain't right, hold on
I know you got the feeling, hold on
Hey this is my life, hold on
I know you got the feeling, hold on
Baby you're price ain't right, I know
You feel like hitting the ceiling, hold on
Hey this is my life, hold on

So we're arguing
Talking about it back and forth
And forth and back as if there is no source
And now I'm wondering
Is this what he had in mind?
Cause if I thought we'd get through that door
Tell me what's gonna be my price
So I said to him

I know you mean well
You're genuine I can tell
Besides you and me
I know that we would soar
But are you ready?
You gotta be sure, you gotta be sure

Oh no, I know you got the feeling, hold on
Baby, you're price ain't right, hold on
I know you got the feeling, hold on
Hey this is my life, hold on
I know you got the feeling, hold on
Baby you're price ain't right, I know
You feel like hitting the ceiling, hold on
Hey this is my life, hold on
