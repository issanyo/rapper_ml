[Intro 1: Knight Jones]
Hey guys!
Are you hungry?
My mom made food

[Intro 2: Kelis and Knight Jones]
Oh ah, ohh ohh ah
Oh ah, ohh ohh ohh ah
Oh ah, ohh ohh ah
Oh ah, ohh ohh ohh ah

[Verse 1: Kelis]
I wanna say thank you (Thank you)
You've been more than just a man
You've really been a friend

[Verse 2: Kelis]
And I wanna say thank you (Thank you)
For putting me to the test
When I know you could've left me behind

[Verse 3: Kelis]
When I feel like I'm knocked back off my feet
And I swear I'm all alone
You're the one who carries me

[Verse 4: Kelis]
Simple things like giving me your peace
You're strong enough to be
Exactly what I need

[Chorus 1: Kelis]
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

[Chorus 1: Kelis]
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

[Verse 5: Kelis]
Sometimes it's just so dark
And I can't see past my hand
But you're solid as a rock
You're everything I know

[Verse 6: Kelis]
When I'm done with it again
You told me still stand
When it's said and done
I am just what I am

[Interlude: Kelis]
So much of who we are
Is from who taught us how to love
So much of who we are
Is from who first taught us how to love

[Chorus 1: Kelis]
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

[Chorus 1: Kelis]
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

[Chorus 1: Kelis]
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

[Chorus 2: Kelis]
This is the real thing
The real thing with us

[Bridge: Kelis]
Maybe we'll make it to breakfast
(Maybe we, maybe we can make it to breakfast)
Sing it with me, sing it with me
Maybe we'll make it to breakfast
Sing it with me
Maybe we'll make it to breakfast
Sing it with me
Maybe we'll make it to breakfast
(Maybe we can make it to breakfast)

[Chorus 1: Kelis]
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

[Chorus 1: Kelis]
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

[Chorus 1: Kelis]
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

[Chorus 1: Kelis]
This is the real thing
The real thing with us
Welcome to the world

[Outro: Kelis and Knight Jones]
Oh ah, ohh ohh ohh ah
Oh ah, ohh ohh ohh ah
Oh ah, ohh ohh ah
Oh ah, ohh ohh ohh ah
