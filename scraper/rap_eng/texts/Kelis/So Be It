Oh, just listen
This world has a bunch of pseudo prophets
Sprouting their personal lies as truth
This world is full of opportunists
Spreading their sickness like a virus to the youth

The misinformation and corruption
Lead to deception
Teaching a lesson

One day, one day
(?)
One day, one day
(?)

Its for the mercenary that I
(Carry a coffin)
Its for the dignitary that I
(Carry a coffin)
To bury corruption
(Carry a coffin)
It is for the police that I
(Carry a coffin)

One day, one day
(?)
One day, one day
(?)
One day, one day
One day

This song is dedicated to the one (creator) above
And the third eye (creator) of the Kushite
And the Christian, anti-Christian
And the Baptist, and the Black Fist
And the Buddhist too
(Creator, creator, creator, creator)

One day, one day
One day
(?)
One day
(?)
