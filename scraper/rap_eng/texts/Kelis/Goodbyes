Heaven knows that, I love ya so
But he don't know, what's real
All I see, is you and me
But you ain't tryin' to hear me

I don't know what tomorrow's bringin'
All I know is your doorbell's ringin'
On that front, let's not waste more precious time
When that cab door closes, I'm in it
And when that plane takes off, you'll regret it
Don't look like that, you know that makes me cry

Hello, Goodbyes, just told so right
Said I love ya, I want ya
Don't wanna make ya mad
Well I'm comin' home anyway
Hello, Goodbyes, just told so right
Said I love ya, I want ya
Don't wanna make ya mad
Well I'm comin' home anyway

What should I do, to soothe your heart?
'Cuz if I stay, might go astray, and fall apart, hear me out

I don't know what tomorrow's bringin'
Or how I'm going to make it tonight
Without you or the other side of your back
When that cap door closes, I'm in it
And when that plane takes off, you'll regret it
I know, babe, this is hard, but don't give up yet

Hello, Goodbyes, just told so right
Said I love ya, I want ya
Don't wanna make ya mad
Well I'm comin' home anyway
Hello, Goodbyes, just told so right
Said I love ya, I want ya
Don't wanna make ya mad
Well I'm comin' home anyway

Babe, I gotta make time for me... before I can make time for you
So we can have time for us, ya know?

Think about when I get back, baby
Your heart don't have to be hurt, baby
Till then, I'll miss you, miss you, miss you

Hello, Goodbyes, just told so right
Said I love ya, I want ya
Don't wanna make ya mad
Well I'm comin' home anyway
Hello, Goodbyes, just told so right
Said I love ya, I want ya
Don't wanna make ya mad
Well I'm comin' home anyway
