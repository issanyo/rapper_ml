[Intro: Jean Baptiste]
Jump on the spaceship
Jump on the spaceship
Jump on the spaceship
Jump on the spaceship

[Chorus: Kelis x2]
Sitting on top of the world
Watching the stars go by
I've got my head in a dream, got my head in the clouds
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
So get high, get high
Get high, get high
So get high, get high
Get high, get high

[Verse: apl.de.ap]
You better move
Check out the bassline groove
Take control of your body, soul
Let the rhythm just take control
Once the beat drops, it explodes
Technologic overload
Techno music around the globe
Take control of your body, soul, soul, soul, let's go

[Bridge: Jean Baptiste]
Jump on the spaceship, take off
Jump on the spaceship, go off
Jump on the spaceship, take off
Jump on the spaceship, get on

[Chorus: Kelis x2]

[Bridge: Jean Baptiste]

[Outro: Kelis]
Jump on the spaceship
