(Miz) Intro: (0:00:02 – 0:00:08)
Hey this is Miz and Twan at the Hip-Hop Barber Shop, it’s time to listen to Poncho and James. So bust a move Blazin. Haha

(Poncho) Verse 1: (0:00:11 – 0:00:49)
It’s like walkin, talkin, and praisin the Lord
(Kris Kross - No it don’t stop, no it don’t stop)
All you gotta do is run from the Feds, see the criminals
And make your cocky predictions
All you gotta do is go jump high and (Kris Kross – gee, gee, geek)
While you roll on the road
And sing to the Lord
For everything that he doe’s
Because we roll down the street
And count our blessings
(Kris Kross – And it don’t stop and it don’t quit
Servin all them little fools
For an Andre like this)
We better recognize what we facin
Because we say (Kris Kross – Dumb dada dee da dumb)
(Kris Kross  - Word a) I gotta go out and get (Kris Kross – butter)
For my pancakes and (Kris Kross – or a) waffle for my Miss Amazin
And with 60 Seconds left
You know it’s a shame

(Kris Kross) Chorus: (0:00:50 – 0:01:11)
I’m real
Cash realer then real deal ho
So all that stuff that ya pop need to stop
Cuz I’m real
Cash realer then real deal ho
It ain’t my fault what I drop
It’s the top so just chill
Cash realer then real deal ho
So all that stuff that ya pop need to stop
Cash realer then real deal ho
And when I drop, when I drop homies know the deal

Verse 2: (0:01:11 – 0:02:11)

So for all you of you people that think (Kris Kross – Cyber hill son)
You know that I rock the world and
I am (Kris Kross – comin/ nothin to me make it boog it I just do it with ease)
I get some honey for my butter please
Because everytime that I wash my hands
I go get some honey and a whole lot of money
(Kris Kross – watch that) Helicopter fly so hard
(Kris Kross – watch that) It”ll have you sayin oh my God
(Poncho/0:01:33 – 0:02:13)
Well make way for PBA as I see Rudy Gay
Hitten the three’s and playin with the Kings
It’s a shame that Mr. Bling (Kris Kross – Bo Yao ewww child)
Became the King
Because through it all I’m flyin with my queen
And for all you that don’t know my flow
I’ m about to show you how it goe’s (Kris Kross – and here it comes)
(Kris Kross – See) Make way for the prince, king, and queen
I”ll bust you and make you eat greens
And for every little thing that you do
I”ll have you on the floor lookin like a fool
(Kris Kross – On and on till the break of Donut
Don’t stop baby pop baby
Till early mornin)
This why it’s great seeing the Lord
(Kris Kross – so watch that) Big man make all the doe

(Kris Kross) Chorus: (0:02:13 – 0:02:52) (Twice)
I’m real
Cash realer then real deal ho
So all that stuff that ya pop need to stop
Cuz I’m real
Cash realer then real deal ho
It ain’t my fault what I drop
It’s the top so just chill
Cash realer then real deal ho
So all that stuff that ya pop need to stop
Cash realer then real deal ho
And when I drop, when I drop homies know the deal

(Twan) Ending: (0:02:55 – 0:03:10)
You already know Poncho and James spittin out bars
For all the real homies around
You heard what they said so just bop your head
And if you try to mess with them
Your def. Gonna get tossed by the Nation
Nevertheless I’m the best. I’m out of here ya”ll
Yea, yea
