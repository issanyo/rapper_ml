[Verse 1]
When you say you love me to me, don't leave me, na na na
Now I got that feeling you without me will break my heart
Cause the sunlight's in my eyes when you're out of sight
You could've seen me shine, I'll tell you one more time

[Chorus]
If you love me, love me like you say you do
Then you need to, do what you say you do
If you love me, love me like you say you do
Then you need to, love me like you say you do

[Post-Chorus]
Do you love me? Love me like you say you do
Then you need to, love me like you say you do
Love me like you say you do

[Verse 2]
Now you got me feeling bad, I'm slipping far away from you
And you're doing all the things I said that you should do
But it only lasts so long like the setting sun
So under these blue skies, I'll tell you one more time

[Chorus]
If you love me, love me like you say you do
Then you need to, do what you say you do
If you love me, love me like you say you do
Then you need to, love me like you say you do

[Bridge]
Love me like you say you do
You gotta love me like you say you do
Say you do, say you do
Holla, holla, tell you what I want, yeah
Gotta, gotta love me like you should, yeah
Holla, holla, tell you what I need, yeah
Gotta love me like you say you do

[Chorus]
If you love me, love me like you say you do
Then you need to, do what you say you do
If you love me, love me like you say you do
Then you need to, love me like you say you do

[Post-Chorus]
Do you love me? Love me like you say you do
Then you need to, love me like you say you do
