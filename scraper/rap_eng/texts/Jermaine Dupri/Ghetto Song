Y'all know how we do it
What's up

[Lil Pete]
Nigga ghetto for life and I'm Be here forever
Thug niggas from these streets and we hustler for cheddar
So we can live better and have bigger thangs
Blow joke all day and sip on champagne
See in this that I call home
We slang crack all night till the early mourn
First street across the Georgia where I got it on

Sticky pants and t-shirts with my fucking stone
Mean-mug on my face everyday, home
I keep my radio tune to this ghetto song
And pray to God that it won't be long before we hit the top
I shit blow up nigga and hit the fucking chart
A nigga riding

[Chorus]
[Bone Crusher]
Hit the rib shack for a little snack
I see this little shawty with the donkey in the back
"Only in the hood with ya fineness, just so fine ghetto princess"
Why not? My focus is all that I got
Shout's out to Goodie Long stay strong Cool Joe
We done it we all foe
I wish them young niggas would get off the blow
But it's like this in every ghetto
But I stay strong maybe thers's some hope
I like to have fun but life ain't a joke
Sometimes I just wanna sit back and smoke

[Chorus] (2x)
