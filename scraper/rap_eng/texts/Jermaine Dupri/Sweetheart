Girl:  What's up, Jermaine?  I miss you
JD:  Mmm
Girl:  Do me a favor.  Tell your friends you're not going out tonight
I got a little bit of that Cristal, some of that Yak
And, oh.  Better yet, I got on what you like to see in the most
JD:  Word!
Girl:  So, we're fucking tonight
JD:  Ha, ha, ha.  For sure.  Ha, ha

[JD - Verse 1]
Uh, ha
What you thinkin' about?
You and me baby goin' one-on-one (say what)
JD y'all (uh huh, So So Def)
MC y'all (what you think about)
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything that you see in your dreams (c'mon)
Baby, let nothing and nobody tear us apart
If forever you'll be my sweetheart

[Verse 1: Mariah]
Boy, haven't you noticed (Say what?)
The gleam in my eyes? (uh, huh)
Because of you I'm a little hypnotized (yeah)
But everytime you're with me (uh)
Feel so positive
That with you a little love
Somethings gotta give

[Mariah Carey - Hook]
A full moon is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon you will come to be my knight
Here we are
Hoping that we'll never part
Stay with me

[Mariah Carey - Verse 3]
You are no Casanova (ha, ha, ha)
I'll know that you'll be true
And that's why (uh)
I'm so in love with you (me, too)
But this romantic evening
You led me at my door (yeah, yeah)
But tonight, I'd like us to explore

[JD - Verse 5]
JD y'all
MC y'all
See, I saw you at the party
With your eyes on me
Fittin' the description
Of what I want my bride to be (ha, ha)
As live as me
Don't know the same guys as me
But a lot of style
Unusual name like Ivory
I agree with my niggas
You the baddest
I ever seen in a long time (uh)
But woman with her own shine
Is her own time
And it's on hit
Cuz I'm tired of dealin'
With the wrong kind
Getting non' but the bullshit
She got a playa
Tryin' to think of new things to say (sup, baby)
She up in the corner
Sippin' Don P, Rosee` (yeah)
Shakin' it up with the homegirls
Payin' no attention to us
They in they own world
'Hey, yo, girl'
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything you see in your dreams
Baby, let nothing and nobody tear us apart
If forever you'll be my sweetheart

[Verse 6]
