I don't believe that we were put together not to be together
And I don't believe there's anyone out there that can love me better
I don't believe that you know how much I miss seeing your pretty smile
Of course we had our ups and downs
But I gotta have you around me cause

[Hook:]
I feel it all over my body (I feel it all over my body)
I dream about you when I sleep (yea)
You're the one for me (you're the one)
You're the one for me (you're the one)
All the signs say that
Ever since the day that we laid eyes on each other baby
You're the one for me (you're the one)
You're the one for me (hey)

[verse 2:]
I don't believe that you know how much I melt every time I smell your scent boy
And I don't believe (I don't believe) I got myself in this predicament
I'm sorry (I'm so sorry)
For everything I ever did wrong
I'm sorry (I'm so sorry)
And I'm begging you, begging you, begging you, baby please come back home

[Hook:]
I feel it all over my body (I feel it all over my body)
I dream about you when I sleep (yea)
You're the one for me (you're the one)
You're the one for me (you're the one)
All the signs say that
Ever since the day that we laid eyes on each other baby
You're the one for me (you're the one)
You're the one for me (hey)

[bridge:]
When I lay in my bed at night
I'm hoping and praying that you feel the same way that I do deep down inside (inside)
And that feeling you just can't control
It makes you wanna just call me
And tell me how much you really miss me
It makes you wanna call me
And say that you can't wait to hold and kiss me, kiss me all over

[Hook:]
I feel it all over my body (hey)
I dream about you when I sleep (dream)
You're the one for me (you're the one)
You're the one for me (you're the one)
All the signs say that
Ever since the day that we laid eyes on each other baby
You're the one for me (you're the one)
You're the one for me (hey)
