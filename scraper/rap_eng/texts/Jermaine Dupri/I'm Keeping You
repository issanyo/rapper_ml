[Verse 1]
I'm gonna light a candle, babe (candle, babe)
To set the mood
Only if you want me to
I'll undress you (undress you, undress you)
Forget about your mistress for tonight
'Cause I'm the only lady in your life
I know you didn't know I knew
This is what I'm gonna do

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you so right
I'm not gon' fuss, I won't fight
(I'm not trippin' 'bout it)
'Cause you're here and you're mine
And no matter what you do
I'm keeping you (I'm keeping you, baby)
For better or worse
No matter how much it hurts
Cause you're here and you're mine
And no matter what you do
I'm keeping you, I'm keeping you

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna love you so completely
You'll remember why you chose me
There's so much, so much between us
And I compromise, you have my forgiveness
One night of love won't make it right
But let's start somewhere
It's worth the fight
I know we can fix this
Even if it takes the rest of our lives

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you so right
I'm not gon fuss, I won't fight
Cause you're here and you're mine
And no matter what you do
I'm keeping you
For better or worse
No matter how much it hurts
Cause you're here and you're mine
And no matter what you do
I'm keeping you

[Bridge]
(Call her) Tell you can't hang
(Call her) Tell her things just ain't the same
(Call her) Tell her how much you love me
(Call her) Tell her you're right where
Right where you wanna be

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you so right
I'm not gon fuss, I won't fight
Cause you're here and you're mine
And no matter what you do
I'm keeping you
For better or worse
No matter how much it hurts
Cause you're here and you're mine
And no matter what you do
I'm keeping you
