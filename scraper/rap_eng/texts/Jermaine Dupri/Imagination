[Intro: Tamia & (Jermaine Dupri)]
See, ya'll wanna dance? (yeah yeah)
Cuz I'mma make you dance (uh huh)
All I want is for you to use your imagination (come on)
That's all
Come on (come on)

[Hook: Tamia]
What makes us do
The things we do
That keeps me lovin' you (imagination)
And when you're in need
And got nobody
Imagination sets you free, free

[Verse 1: Tamia]
Everything you want is real close when you close your eyes
And the things you think about the most
They come to life (come to life)
When your relationship is heading for the rocks
Gotta use your imagination to get you back on top

[Hook: Tamia]

[Verse 2: Tamia]
It's the place you look when you want to have some fun
When you see it, say it, before it's done, uh huh
Imagine you and me, and how it would feel
Exploring new ideas and what's gon' keep this lovin' real
When you get lonely (lonely)
It'll make you get to a phone and tell me how much you want me
And when you have a bad day
A little bit of imagination goes a long way

[Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri]
Oh, true buff playa, that's the chi-chi
Wanna get up out the store, you'll need to see me
Now I got you wondering, look behind the slouch
If you get too close when you get turned out
No doubt, it won't be the same if I hit it
Cuz you always gon' want it the way I did it
I'mma keep you fresh, make sure you stay kiddy
See once I got it, can't nobody else get it
From the bottom to the top
'Till you say stop
You and me, wit the freak cuz I'mma great drop
I'll kiss everything, I don't miss a spot
Stuff you ain't never seen from the man you got
I ain't hatin', my imagination's just more advanced
So when you wanna dance, I'mma make you dance
Tamia I see ya, I'm still waiting
You make me wanna, leave that to your imagination

[Hook: Tamia x3]
