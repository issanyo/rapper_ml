[Intro: Notorious B.I.G. sample]
It's the ones that smoke blunts wit cha
See ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get cha
It's the ones that smoke blunts wit cha
See ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get cha

[Chorus]
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act

[Verse 1: Mack Daddy]
It's Monday night and I'm out
Chillin' with my girl, top down
500 SL pumpin' some sounds
Now me I'm in Versace from my head to toe
Lookin' for a place to go
So I can spend my dough
I found a spot, jumped out
My girl was hot, no doubt
And that was all I heard these bustas talkin' about
Now I ain't payin' no attention to this high school skit
And I ain't even tryin' to fight over this here dip
I kept walkin', but all they did was follow
Tryin' to flex
Talkin' about my girls titties
And the jewels around my neck
Now I can feel a confrontation 'bout to jump on off
And I can see these little bustas
Tryin' to play me for soft
I heard "stick up, stick up, get down and don't look up
Nigga give me all your money and your jewels cause you're stuck"
I said "What?" fightin' back hit my mind
But it's a waste of time cause I ain't got my nine
And these

[Chorus]
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act, I say
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act

[Verse 2: Daddy Mack]
Now I done did all this work
So I can be the man
Fresh to def, twenty grand in a black sedan
Not knowin' I done had some homies watchin'
Steady clockin', plottin' to put da drop on me
Cause I'm flossin', hit the streets left and right
Sittin' swoll, lookin' for me a party that's tight
I heard somebody yell "112" that's the spot
So I hit the parking lot
Not thinkin' of gettin' got
Cause it's mack, players, pimps, and dips everywhere
But niggas don't know how to act and they don't care
I heard "freeze" from these four niggas
That I knew, that I knew from back in grade school
I said "What's up?"
He said "What's up?" It's on
Give it all up and then he showed me his chrome
I said "Homes, you ain't even gots to trip
Cause I ain't even tryin' to die over materialistics"

[Chorus]
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act, I say
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act
