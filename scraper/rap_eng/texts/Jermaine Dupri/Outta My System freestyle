(Poncho) Intro: (0:00:02 – 0:00:24)
(Ohh) Yeah; you know girl
We've been in the highways and byways (out of business)
And we've had situations come and go
And it's tough to get you out of my system (woah woah woah woah Heyyy)
Nobody compares to you like I do
But I can't get you out of my system (oh oh ohhhh)
But check this out (Hey Hey)

(Poncho) Verse 1: (0:00:27 – 0:01:09)
I'm chillen with my friends lookin like (spam)
I'm tryna finish this situation at hand (hand)
I can't get you out of my mind (outta my mind)
And I can't get you out of my system (outta my system)
When it all comes down to it (down to it)
You the one that is meant for me
Because the Lord put you in my mind
And he put you in my my heart
(24/7777) I thank God that I got a great heart
For the people and for the world
Girl you got a great heart in you
And your body, eyes, and your hair is great
(I want your body) you got a nice sexy body
That why I can't get you out of my system
(give me that body) I hope that one day we can be together
Because it's tough you out of my system (system)

(T-Pain) Chorus: (0:01:09 – 0:01:32)
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick
Outta town visits
All the time we spent together makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

(Poncho) Verse 2: (0:01:33 – 0:02:17)
Everyday I think about you always
But I gotta live 24/7
Without livin 24/7; (24/777) I have no heart and no desire
(no desire) I ain't got no passion or no joy
Even to get out of bed someday
(out of bed someday) but when I get out of bed with you
I think of you in my system
(in my system) you are like a drug to me
You are like sweethearts to me
(I gotta have youuu) you are like my hot candy
And you are my sugar plum
(sugar plum yeaaaaa) I thank God everyday for you girl
Because you always in my system
(in my system) when it all comes down to it
I just can't get you out of my system (outta my system)

(T-Pain) Chorus: (0:02:17 – 0:02:41)
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick
Outta town visits
All the time we spent together makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

(Poncho) Verse 3: (0:02:42 – 0:03:04)
It's tough everyday (feels this way) battlin sin
Battlin cancer and (feel this way) demons
And then temptation comes in the way
Because I got the ladies lookin at me
(on my side yeaaa) lookin at my shirtless body
Look at my abs, muscles, and triceps
( take a look at it) but girl nobody compares to you
Because you my “Miss Amazin” (ohhh baby)

(T-Pain) Chorus: (0:03:03 – 0:03:27)
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick
Outta town visits
All the time we spent together makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

(Poncho) Ending: (0:03:27 – 0:03:51)
(ohhhhhh) You know girl it's tough to get you outta my system
