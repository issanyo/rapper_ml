'Yo. Suckas know they can't get with Kris Kross. Yo. Comin' out the Ruffhouse, y'know what I'm saying? Kris Kross. Yeah. (?)'

[Kris Kross]
Aw yeah!
I'm the Daddy Mac, the one you can't get with
Every time I flow it's like (aw yeah)
A (?) of the hardcore, uncut straight to the do'
Lookin' for some mo', telling you where you can go
Get back, Jack, cuz we got 'em (word)
Two young macs droppin' a whole lotta vibe
In the zone, meaning we hit and don't miss
And suckas, you can't get with this

[Caller]
'Ha! Aw yeah. Straight outta Atlanta. Kris Kross. Y'know what I'm sayin'? Raw. Huh? They (?) with nobody, y'know what I'm sayin'? (?) Dreadlocks (?) Skullcap (?)'

[Kris Kross]
Ay yo, Kris, tell 'em how it goes
It goes a-on and on to the break of dawn
We send chills, and so many skills, it's on
The bass keeps knockin', girlies keep jockin'
Places we be rockin' make dollars, we be flockin'
So all y'all suckas need to step off
There ain't a day or a way I could ever come soft
It's on, meaning we hit and don't miss
And suckas, you can't get with this
Fools!

I want to give a shout out to my girl Silk Tymes Leather, (?) and the straight jacker, the X Man, and the whole SSD Posse
Five thousand, g!
And all y'all niggas know y'all can't get with this
Fools! Hahaha....

[Caller]
'Yeah, I'm about to hang up now. Yo. Yo, get with this. Kris Kross in effect, suckas.'
