(The Ladies) Chorus: (0:00:00 – 0:00:34) (4 times)
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
(Yeah - 4th time)

(Poncho) Verse 1: (0:00:36 – 0:00:54)
Now basketball is my favorite sport
I like the way they dribble up and down the court
I like how they shoot them jump shots
16 – 18 foot
I like how they shoot them three-pointers
I like how they dunk on them highlights
Just like Lebron and MJ
Now it's on to Kobe Bryant

(The Ladies) Chorus: (0:00:54 – 0:01:10) (Twice)
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

(Poncho and Atm) Verse 2: (0:01:12 – 0:01:56)
(Poncho) (0:01:12 – 0:01:29)
Tell me would you see the highlights
Of the basketball game
Just like the Utah Jazz vs the Chicago Bulls in 98
I like the Los Angeles Lakers
I could be like Fred Fred Jones
I could shoot like Tim Duncan
Then dunk like Blake Griffen

(Atm) (0:01:30 – 0:01:56)
Yea it's ya boy Atm
Mr. 305 from Miami, Florida
I like them Miami Heat or Orlando Magic
In Florida
I shoot them three pointers
Like Dwade and Gordan Giricek
And I dunk like Dwight Howard
And I block like Dikembe Mutombo
Yao Ming is my favorite center
That's why I like Tony Parker
I like how Chris Paul handles them handles
On the basketball court

(The Ladies) Chorus: (0:01:56 – 0:02:13) (Twice)
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

(DJ Blazin) Verse 3: (0:02:14 – 0:02:32)
Somebody take me back to the 1980's
90's and 2000's when Vince Carter had that dunk
Everybody was like wow that's Vince Carter
Then they saw Nate Robinson
Jeremy Lin with Linsanity
Then it was on to the New Era
With the young Basketball Team

(The Ladies) Chorus: (0:02:31 – 0:03:05) (4 times)
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
