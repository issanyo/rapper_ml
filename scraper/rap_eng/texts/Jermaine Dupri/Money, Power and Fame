Verse 1: [Chris Terry]
I'm on this mad paper chase, I'm talkin bout stackin them g's

I used to live in hell, now I'm livin swell
And I pop a hundred times off a bottle of Mo (bottle of mo)
And then I walk up out the do with yo ho slow (ho slow)
Playas know about this late night creep
They claimin you with your girls
But with me you be sleepin

Verse 2: [MACK DADDY: Chris Kelly]
Now dividends and millions, is what i stressed on the last jam
But now im back with the dopeness on the other hand (yeah uh huh)
Young rich and dangerous is what im stressin on (sya what)
A little something for you niggas to get your tweak on (uh)

And if you get out of line, then we goin put yo ass in check (so check)
Comin from me to you (to you)
D A double D tell these niggas what you bout to do

Verse 3: [DADDY MACK: Chris Smith]
Cut her up, slice her down, take her back to the crib

Combination put together better known as the

And then you have the C-connection

Chorus: [MACK DADDY and DADDY MACK]
Now who could it be, pullin up to the do in the Be n-z
It's the mack with the stack of that cash money
Mack Daddy: (and im here to take your girl)
Now who could it be pullin up to the do in the range rover
Daddy mack lookin like a four leaf clover
Daddy Mack: (and im feelin lucky tonight)
Now who could it be pullin up in that brand new Mercedes
It's that dope rhyme sayer named Chris Terry
Chris Terry: (and I got money on my mind)

Verse 4: [MACK DADDY: Chris Kelly]
Now one more time, everybody please get in motion
And get up out your seats to start some comotion
I'm hopin, any nigga that is sent to me
I'm in the state of mind to rhyme against whoever
And any MC who disagree on my quotes
I advise you to reevaluate your notes
Cause I feel that I'm one step ahead of the rest
Sportin emeralds diamonds ruby reds to begettes

Verse 5: [Chris Terry]
Now see money power and fame,  three thangs thats a neccessity
Niggas be tryin to steal my style like it was a recipe
But mackin ain't easy, believe me
Even I be gettin tired of all the different women who tryin to please me
So we hops in the jeep, proceed to catch a freak
Put that mackin down now we headed back to the suite
So um... we can get served, all night long
Cause at 6 in the mornin, we got to take them 3 home

Verse 6: [DADDY MACK: Chris Smith]
Now I went from pushin a skylar, to a county on chrome
Makin ways megabucks before I was grown
Givin bone to the ones who deserved it (deserved it)
Get respected in the hood cause I earned it (earned it)
And my crew comes in all shapes and sizes
Mostly under 20 dangerous young rich survivors
And I admire, how you (?)
16 sex (?) between my grown women

Chorus (repeat X1)
