[Intro - Marques Houston]

Here it is y'all, one more time
JD, MH (come on)
(JD: Yeah, So So Def is in the building)

[Bridge - Marques Houston]
It's the - MH and Pied Pied Pied Piper
MH and Pied Pied Pied Piper
We get the girls so-so hyper
We make 'em say da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1 - Marques Houston]
Pulled up to the party, in a black Lexus jeep (yeah)
Hop up out the whip I'm feelin' freaky (ohh)
All the ladies comes surround me
Cause I'm so important, like the H in Hi-C
This one girl, she making my body fien
I'm {fucked} up on hypnotic and ice cream
So I stepped to her, like I knew her
Introduced her to Jacob the Jewler
Mami won't you come take a ride with me (ohh)
Be the girl of my fantasies
But first won't you do one thing for me
Baby won't you come pop ya booty for me (0hh)

[Hook - Marques Houston]
Love the way you move so sexy (oohh oh)
I love it when you are all up on me
But one thing I have to see
Is the way you pop that booty (pop it for me)
I love the way you move so sexy
I love it when you all up on me (ohh oh)
Girl take the floor and you'll see
Let me see you pop that booty

[Bridge]

[Verse 2 - Marques Houston]
Girl shake that ahh like there's no rules
Love the way you move in those high heel shoes
So pop your booty like +Beyonce+
Got me falling +Crazy In Love+ with you
Making me wanna say
Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Girl you shaped like a Coke bottle
So let me see you pop your thing full throttle

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3 - Jermaine Dupri]
I don't do too many skinny or the runway frail
Thick with it is how we like it in the ATL
Sick with it, pants low with a real wide load
As soon as you hit the door everybody was like (OOOOH!)
And it's hard for you to go to the mall and buy clothes
Cause your waist is so little and your ass is like (WHOA!)
You poppin' that thing like a Luke video
Mesmerized by the sound and the way the flutes blow
Drink in my right hand, another in my left
Crew right behind me screamin So So Def
Now forgive me if I'm staring, but I gotta no one thing
How in the hell did you get all that in those jeans
I'm behind you +Grindin+, molding the +Clipse+
Cause I ain't never seen nobody pop they booty like dis
What I'm saying is, what you doing is major
The way you keep, shaking, shaking, shaking what cha momma gave ya

[Marques Houston]
Mami dancing all on me
She not wearing any panties (ok)
I love it when she call me dada
The way she pops it like she from Jamaica

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro - Marques Houston]
