[Verse 1]
A funny thing 'bout love - we choose
It ain't perfect but we do the best we can
Do you understand?
And I love you more than words can say
Here's to known that you'll stay with me
Through the complications
Baby, what I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
I don't wanna give up on our fate
And I don't wanna think that it's too late
So if something is broke, let me go and fix it
And if something is lost, let me go and get it
'Cause I don't wanna stand when all is done
And I'll be next to you 'cause you're the one
I said it twice and I'ma say once more
You're the one I want, I'm never gonna letchu go

[Verse 2]
There are time when I don't get around to say
What I feel like sayin', no
There are time when it get so hard
I feel like I can't take it, you make me want you
And fight you, love you and despise you
Still when it feel like I ain't got nothin' left
I remind myself that...

[Chorus]
I don't wanna give up on our fate, no
And I don't wanna think that it's too late
So if something is broke, let me go and fix it
And if something is lost, let me go and get it
'Cause I don't wanna stand when all is done
And I'll be next to you 'cause you're the one
I said twice and I'ma say once more
You're the one I want
I'm never gonna letchu go

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm never gonna letchu go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Still when it feels like I got nothin' left
I remind myself that

[Chorus]
I don't wanna give up on our fate
And I don't wanna think that it's too late
So if something is broke, let me go and fix it
And if something is lost, let me go and get it
'Cause I don't wanna stand when all is done
And I'll be next to you 'cause you're the one
(You're the one for me)
I said twice and I'ma say once more
You're the one I want
I'm never gonna letchu go
I'm never gonna letchu go
I'm never gonna letchu go
Never let you go now
Never let you go now
I'm never gonna letchu go
Never let you go now
I said I'm never let you go now
I'm never gonna letchu go
