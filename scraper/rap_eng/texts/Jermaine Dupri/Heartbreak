[Verse: Jagged Edge]
Can't take another heartbreak
(Why, why, why)
Why did you do the things you did
Knowing that I love you so baby
(Tell me why)
Tell me why, why did you turn around and leave me
Left me for dead baby
(Hurt me so)
Girl you hurt me so
Now I'm on my knees
And baby I'm crying
Tell me why
(Tell me why)
And baby tell me why
(Why, why, why)
And why
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Jermaine Dupri]
