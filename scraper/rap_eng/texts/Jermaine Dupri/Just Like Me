[Intro: Lil' Kim]
You got it going on
You got it going on

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Strictly fuck with those six-digit niggas
If the first one is a nine, they a buck behind
I live my rhyme at the same time, can't find myself laying up
If you ain't paying up, bullets start spraying up
You know my niggas is sick
The game ain't enough for you to run up in this
I need stacks of chips, you know, dream house money
Shit, you just like me, so don't start acting funny

[Verse 2: Usher]
You're the kind of girl that makes
Everybody feel that you're just so damn good
So damn good
But your secrets, I've found out
So don't deny what you're about
I know the truth
You know I do, I do 'cause....

[Chorus: Usher]
I know you get lonely (just like me)
And you want it (just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
I know you get lonely (just like me)
And you want it (just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me

[Verse 3: Usher]
Quiet is kept you cry for help
When no one else is there I bet you touch yourself
Does it feel good?
Late night calls, I bet you do it all
Anything to get it off
But you still persist to front on me
Baby, tell me

[Bridge]
Why do we play this game of chase
When we know we both feel the same way?
And why do you put me through all these changes
When you know you're just a freak like me?
You're just like me

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
If I had one wish in the world, I swear to God
It would be for girls to rock pearls, straight out the oyster
Voice your opinion, Queen Bee made a million
Got mirrors on my ceiling, so I can see it
When your head be in between it, if I had a penis
I'd be heartless, for real, though, niggas start shit
I'd just flash out my dildo, y'all move too quick
Thought I'd be memorized by your cocaine bricks
And you smoke gray six, nigga, I thought you was a groupie
Obsessed fan with my pictures in your hooptie
You heard my record, now you know I'm freaky
So you, wanna wreck it and you, wanna see me
How your dreams be, you want me sexual
In a gun fight, two on three, I'm next to pull
And I love life, something you never could imagine
Then you woke the fuck up, it's just rapping

[Chorus: Usher]
I know you get lonely (just like me)
And you want it (just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
I know you get lonely (just like me)
And you want it (just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me

[Outro: Usher]
Don't front like you don't, you're just like me
Just like me
Just like me
Just like me, yeah
Just like me
