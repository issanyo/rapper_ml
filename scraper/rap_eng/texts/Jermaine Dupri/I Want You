[Verse 1: Elijah Kelley, Evan Ross, Jude Demorest]
Tell me girl, do you know what you want?
Tell me girl, do you understand how rare it is indeed
Just to know who you are?
Oh, tell me girl, what’s in your heart?
I know it’s hard, can you play a part?
Can you take your mind off the silly things
Keep your eye on the ball?
I know this inconsistent relationship trip is killing youIt’s killing me too, believe it or not
But you ain’t gotta worry
'Bout nobody comin round here
Getting none of this, or takin’ your spot

[Pre-Chorus: Brittany O'Grady, Ryan Destiny, Luke James]
Do you think about the times that we’re together?
And she said, “No,but I think about the times we ain’t together”
And I said “Oh”
I said, “No, this ain’t right”
Since your hands got too much time
Staying up all hours of the night
Checking my page, seeing who and what I like
On my timeline, seeing who is new
Don’t worry about who follows who
Baby here’s the truth
Yeah I see a lot of people
But baby I want you

[Chorus: Luke James, Ryan Destiny, Both]
I’m try a love you true
Celebrate who you are
Appreciate you for you
Baby I want you
We need to let go of the jealousy
Cause turnin’ our back won’t do
Without compromise, we’d lose
Oh baby I want you

[Verse 2: Jude Demorest, Brittany O'Grady, Evan Ross]
It’s you, I really can’t say enough about you
Yeah baby I choose
All I wanna do is be around you
Don’t you worry ‘bout the old
Cause we’re on to the new
Ain’t studdin’ them, ‘cause I’m thinkin’ ‘bout you
Know that nothing can come between
What we have and what we do
So for the times that I’m gone
Know that this much is true
Baby you are not alone
So I’m asking you

[Pre-Chorus: Elijah Kelley, Luke James, Ryan Destiny]
Do you think about the times that we’re together?
And she said, “No, I think about the times we ain’t together”
I said “Oh”
What in the world are we tryna do?
What we tryna say?
What we tryna prove?
Fussin’ and fightin’ like we want a war
When we both know that ain’t true
As long as the sky is blue
As long as the homie sing a song or two
Baby it’s true, I’ma see a whole lot of people
But baby I want you

[Chorus: Luke James, Ryan Destiny, Both]
I’m try a love you true
Celebrate who you are
Appreciate you for you
Baby I want you
We need to let go of the jealousy
Cause turnin’ our back won’t do
Without compromise, we’d lose
Oh baby I want you

[Post-Chorus: Luke James, Brittany O'Grady, Jude Demorest]
Oh baby I choose you, happy to have you
And not cause I need you, but baby I want you
There’s a whole lot of noise in the world going on
A whole lot of drama we can cause
If we want, but we don’t so we won’t
Cause baby I want you

[Outro: Elijah Kelley, Ryan Destiny, Brittany O'Grady, Evan Ross, (Jude Demorest)]
I want you babe
Because I want you, because I want you
Not cause I need you, I really want you babe
And I guess I want you, happy to have you
Not cause I need you, because I want you babe
Not cause I need you, I really love you
I really want you babe
And I gotta have you, I wanna lead you
I kinda need you babe
(I’m happy to have you
I really love you
And I choose you babe)
