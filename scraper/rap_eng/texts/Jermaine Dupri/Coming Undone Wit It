[Intro]
Yeahhhhhhh
D.F.B. bitch! And Korn in this muh'fucker
The collaboration, yeah-yeahhyurrr

[Jonathan Davis] WAIIIIIT! I'm coming undone

[Intro]
I let my shoulders lean, I snap my neck back
I let my wrist pop, I make my fingers snap
First I let my shoulders lean, then I snap my neck back
Then I let my wrist pop, then I make my fingers snap

[repeat 8X over Intro]
Lean wit it, rock wit it!!

[Verse 1] + {Jonathan Davis}
I bounce in the club so the hoes call me Rocky
Posted in the cut, and I'm lookin for a blockhead
Yup in my white tee I break a bitch back
And I keep a big bank, oh I think they like dat {WAIIIIIT!}
'Fore I leave the house I'm slizzerd on the goose
And I'm higher then a plane so a nigga really loose
And I can lean wit it (lean wit it) and I can rock wit it (rock wit it)
And if you gotta friend she gotta suck a cock wit it!

[Chorus: Jonathan Davis]
WAIIIIIT! I'm coming undone
IRAAAATE! I'm coming undone
TOO LATE! I'm coming undone
One look so, strong so delicate

[repeat 8X over Intro]
Lean wit it, rock wit it!!

[Verse 2]
Clean who wanna pop lock from left to right a nigga lean
Vibin to the beat, check my feet, ye' ain't got deez
I rock then bend my knees, everytime the beat drop
Lean wit it, rock wit me, freeze fo' your fingers pop

[Verse 3]
Pimpin in the club, 'til the hoes start to act up
Cause they see my chain and a nigga throwin them stacks up
I keep a full clip, and my pistol in my pants
I'm in the middle of the flo' they screamin NIGGA DO YA DANCE!!

[J.D.] That's RIIIIIIIIGHT!
[DFB] Rock wit it, lean wit it, rock wit it, lean wit it
[J.D.] Trigger between my eyes, please STRIIIKE!
[DFB] Middle of the flo' they screamin nigga
[J.D.] Make it quick now

[Chorus]

[repeat 8X over Intro]
Lean wit it, rock wit it!!

[Verse 4]
Rock left then snap ya fingers, right then snap ya fingers
(HEYYYYY) Lean wit it, rock wit it
Gotta pill pop wit me, go on take a shot
Call me Teddy, I got grahams, don't hate, nigga shop
(Do you MIIIIND)
(I'm trying to hold it together)
(Head is lighter than a feather)
{KORN AND THE MOTHERFUCKIN FRANCHIZE BOYZ}

[Chorus]

[repeat 10X over Intro to end]
Lean wit it, rock wit it!!
