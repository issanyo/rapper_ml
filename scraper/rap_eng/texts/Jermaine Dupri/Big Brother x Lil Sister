[Intro: Da Brat (Jermaine Dupri)]
Stupid bitch, haha
Must be out yo motherfuckin' mind man (uh)
Haha (uh) yo

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat (x2)]
I say
Nigga you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your lil sister go harder than mine
Uh, I say
Bitch you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your big brother go harder than mine

[Verse: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat or Both]
One thing's for certain, when you see her, you see me
We in this bitch like the 2016 EPMD
With no buckers, we'll fuck up a beat like it's nothin'
Cause it's nothin'
Introduced in '94 and motherfuckers still love it
You must be buggin'
Got me fucked up, thinkin' I'm go'n leave my label
Thinkin' I'm go'n leave a nigga that been down with me
Since I was a baby, nigga is you crazy, I'm a ride or die bitchAnd So So Def is the reason, I don't work no 9 to 5 bitch
I don't even know what that is
Had a Leroy Glow as a kid, had D boy dough as a kid
I mean, I don't even
Know how that go, the 606-44
If you raise me, and I'm out sign out
Baby so pay me
Now what this is, is that Snoop and Dre, mixed with UGK
When the two of us get together, there's no more playin', GA
We got that Game, that 50, we got that ash for that siftin'
Nigga we solid as a rock
And ain't no nigga that can fuck with me

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat]
I say
Nigga you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your lil sister go harder than mine
Uh, I say
Bitch you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your big brother go harder than mine

[Verse: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat]
In this midst of any drama
I ain't the type of chick that'll leave my brother
I don't run for no cover
I'm a head on collision type bitch, motherfuckers
Shitty, pretty, built that way
My attitude rude, stay the fuck up out of my face
Well I'm known to be a master, everything I kill
No respect around this bitch in 16, you near
Cause I produce and get loose, when it's time to perform
And I don't think nobody can fuck with me
That's word is bond

[Bridge: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat]
You must be out yo mind
Thinkin' we ain't go make no more records
Thinkin' we go'n sit back and be quiet and not give em what they been requestin'
You must be out yo mind
I gets my bread, and I gets any nigga I want
I gets my head, I'ma be So So Def till I'm dead
Me too, me too, I gets my bread
And I can get any bitch I want, I'm hotter than Ferrari Red
It's me in the party with that 42, straight to the head
Ain't no plan, ain't no actin'
What I'm sayin', fully backin'
Please believe me when I say it

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat]
Nigga you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your lil sister go harder than mine
I say
Bitch you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your big brother go harder than mine

[Outro]
Do it again, do it again
Do it again
