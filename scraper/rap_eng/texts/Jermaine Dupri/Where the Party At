[Verse 1: D. Jame$]

Friday night im tipsy tell my girl to hold my keys
Gotta translate tho, she came on a boat from overseas
My driver chaueffer me while im deep off in her ovaries
Head game vicious and her (hey!) smell like potpourri

Bunch of pretty girls sittin at my table
Gone put your card away tonights already paid for
Pop the henny, pop the crown pop, the jame-o
Cuervo, she got me takin shots from her navel

Flow so sick im surprised i ain't dead yet
Coffin up grave stones, think i need bed rest
Yon psycho, need to get my head checked
Takin shots, somebody get my girl a lead vest!

Pay attention to this intricate wizardry
They looking for a leader they specifically sent for me
You only live once? im kinda seeing it differently
Took a bunch acid and  had an epiphany

Whiskey words slurring fresher than a laudrymat
How they get the loud in here, ill let you niggas ponder that
So bright trust me i ain't gotta rap
But test me i snap back like a starter cap

D james independent yeah still reppin
Bank on me, the cpa tell me im well invested
Hella well connected, did what i expected
Fresher than a reverend
Smoking on that seventh heaven

This here is the bomb
I probably should a warned ya
I got it from a farmer that i know in california
Searching for my lil debbie
Betty crocker in versace boxers
Feelin better than  i look
Obnoxious when im rocking
Stop it

Plus the boy so ruthless
Pissed at valet
Can you tell me where my coupe is
I gotta reputation the ladies tell me im the greatest
Laughing at the haters trying to stop me cuz i made it

Nudies  on my ass
All we smoke is gas
Kobe on the blunt d jame$ i never pass
Im the leader of the pack
Im like first in my class
Smart guy
I don't need brain im tryna smash

New girl like the devil in a new dress
Young nigga so fly think i flew jets
So sick when i spit im the new strep
Labels watching trying to see what im'a do next

In the lab makin beats till i fall asleep
Burner phone cuz the labels keep callin me
Voicemail say they heard about my following
I'on call back just email my apologies

Country grammar still 3 1 4
Apply pressure bethcha we won't fold
We next up, yessir yeah we want mo'
So high of key singing fi ga ro
Hey

Where the party at
She work out tryna get that body back
She look good so she be wherever i be at
She kinda shy but that ass so obvious

Well

Old habits die hard so i sip slow
Bad bitch sammitch on the fif flo'
New car so clean think i whip blow
Elbows we gon' need another zip tho

Don't believe in limits
We always steamin spinach
Millennial militia
Flip the switch and then we kill it

We countin' up the digits
Switch it then we pitch it
We make the crowd move
Nigga all you hear is crickets
