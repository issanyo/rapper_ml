[Verse 1]
I remember seeing you do your thing
With a brand new girl on your arm everytime it rained
Used to say one girl is not enough
Now you can't believe you let them go
Fell in love

[Pre-Chorus]
You was a pimp, playboy
You're not a pimp
Now I'm in your life
I'm exempt
'Cause I've got your heart
And now you belong to me, yeah

[Chorus]
When it comes to me, I get what I want
'Cause I made you fall in love
When it comes to me, you don't have control
'Cause I beat you at your game
I beat you at your own game
When it comes to me

[Verse 2]
Now when you go dancing you're with me
No wandering eyes, 'cause I trained you to respect me
You're thinking twice now 'cause you're sprung
You called your mama and you told her that I was the one

[Pre-Chorus]
You was a pimp, playboy (playboy)
You're not a pimp
Now I'm in your life
I'm exempt
'Cause I've got your heart
And now you belong to me, yeah

[Chorus]
When it comes to me, I get what I want
'Cause I made you fall in love
When it comes to me, you don't have control
'Cause I beat you at your game
I beat you at your own game
When it comes to me I get what I want
'Cause I made you fall in love
When it comes to me, you don't have control
'Cause I beat you at your game
I beat you at your own game

I think you're in trouble

[Chorus]
When it comes to me, I get what I want (I get what I want)
'Cause I made you fall in love (made you fall in love)
When it comes to me, you don't have control
'Cause I beat you at your game
I beat you at your own game
When it comes to me, I get what I want
'Cause I made you fall in love
When it comes to me, you don't have control
'Cause I beat you at your game
('Cause I beat you at your game)
I beat you at your own game
(I beat you at your own game)
When it comes to me
Baby, when it comes to me
When it comes to me
I beat you at your own game
When it comes to me, I get what I want
'Cause I made you fall in love (fall in love)
When it comes to me, you don't have control (no, no, no)
'Cause I beat you at your game
I beat you at your own game
When it comes to me, I get what I want
