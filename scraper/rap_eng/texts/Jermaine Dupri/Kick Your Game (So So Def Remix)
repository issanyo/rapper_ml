Ha, bang, bang, bang at your door
Some are real raw shit's breaking law
Hands in the air if you don't care
I know MC's out there it ain't no fear
Nobody's got more game than Craig
My third leg will make it hot enough for you to beg
So grab a seat and recline
Real and genuine
Check how these max on your mind

[Chili](JD)
You just wanna know if you can kick come game
Come with something more clever than just your name
See it's like this I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me that your game is on
(Check it out baby)

[TLC](Craig Mack)
I've been watching you, watching me
(Watching you)
And I know you want it
(And I know you want to get down)
But it depends on how you kick your game
I've been watching you watching me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game
(Give it to me)

[T-Boz]
Leaning against the wall checkin' out the scenery
And all I see is everybody trying to get with me
So I continue to play it crazy, sexy, cool
Lost all composure when I laid my eyes on you

[JD](Left Eye)
Left Eye (yo) I'm sitting in club hand full of dubs
Drinking Mo looking for a little something to love
Straight playa that's my steelo
And you a 4-5-6 straight hit like Cee-lo
(Really?)
Can we go back to my crib?
So I can show you miss lady how ya supposed to live
I see you all the time but on a different note
Would you like to dance with me?
(No uh I'mma bout to go and uh hang my coat)
Check it

Lisa Lopes
It's been a month
I called you twice
You called me once
Baby come with me and be mine
So we can make love on the 50 yard line
You for me, me for you
There's nothing in this world you know we couldn't do
Yeah but umm who, who was that girl all on your back?
Nicole, I'm just a nigga that followed you to the coat rack

[Chili]
You just wanna know if you can kick come game
Come with something more clever than just your name
It's like this I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me, gotta show me that your game is on, oh

[TLC](Craig Mack)
I've been watching you watching me
(Been watching)
And I know you want it
(I know you wanna get down with the funk)
But it depends on how you kick your game
I've been watching you watching me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game
I've been watching you watching me
And I know you want it
(Ha)
But it depends on how you kick your game
I've been watching you watching me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game
