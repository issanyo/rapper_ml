(Notorious B.I.G.) Intro: (0:00:01 – 0:00:11) (Twice)
It's the ones that smoke blunts wit cha
See ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get cha

Chorus: (0:00:12 – 0:00:22)
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act

(Poncho) Verse 1: (0:00:22 – 0:01:07)
Well it's one day and we sitten here chillen in the dorm room with friends and family; getting ready to have a party, then we go out to get some powerrade; when all a sudden we get confronted by three people with baseball bats and guns; with the AK 37 and the AK 47 they ready to tear and blow our heads off. When a security guard stops the action he says just wait hold on one minute; if you all don't stop this mess; I'm gonna have to dish you just like the rest and I'm about to beat you all up so bad; so get back into the line and I”ll put you back on the timeline, because that's how I roll and I just crossed the line

Chorus: (0:01:08 – 0:01:29) (Twice)
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act

(James) Verse 2: (0:01:29 – 0:02:14)
Well first of all let me just explain myself; I'm detective and special agent James Flemington. I own the detectives and agents in the world, because that's how I play the game. I own the cops in the blue, because I can and baby that's how I rule. That's how I role, that's how I go; so guess what you a just a good fool. Like “Fools Gold” just like Andy Mineo and Lecrae (christians rappers there really great), but I'm the detective and special agent just like Law and Order SVU. I own the people in CSI, CSI Miami, and Criminal Minds; if you don't believe just ask myself and I will tell that I'm special agent James Flemington

Chorus: (0:02:15 – 0:02:36) (Twice)
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act

(Poncho) Verse 3: (0:02:36 – 0:03:21)
Well after the party we all go celebrate; we have some and we have some powerrade, we have the chips, and we have the chicken; ready to eat and say 60 seconds on the clock. For those that don’t know what 60 seconds is; there’s 60 seconds on the clock ayeee. So it’s time to get buff that we go hard, because were simply blazin and we stand up. Niggas in the street ain’t right; you already know this is our time to go and if you ain’t down to celebrate with us; then just hit the door and just hit the road. I say niggas in the street ain’t right; you already know that this is the place to shine and if you don’t know what to do with the grind; then hey just hit that hey tine whine

Chorus: (0:03:21 – 0:03:43) (Twice)
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act
