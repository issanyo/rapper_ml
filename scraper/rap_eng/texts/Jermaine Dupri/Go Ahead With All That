[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let's talk about it

[Verse 1]
I used to have a man
That didn't know what he had
Till he saw me in the hands of somebody else
I mean everyday flat no romance
Now he's sitting at home all by himself saying...

[Pre-Chorus]
What did I do? (What did I do?)
It's not what you did
It's what you didn't do, didn't do
What can I say? (What can I say?)
Not a word that'll get me back to you, back to you
Where did I go wrong? (Where did I go wrong?)
Well, remember the times when you didn't come home
I got tired of it, I'm sick of all this
When a woman's fed up
Ain't nothing you can do about it

[Chorus]
Go ahead with all of that
'Cause when you had me, you didn't want me
You just treated me bad
Go ahead with all of that
So what you saw me with somebody else, what?
You're supposed to be mad
You better go ahead with all of that
Baby, baby tough, turn around and walk right out the door
'Cause I gave you too many chances to fix our romance
But I don't want you no more

[Interlude]
No more, no more, no
No more, no
I don't want you
No more, no, no more
No more, no more

[Verse 2]
You used to keep me in the house
Never took me out
Like I heard he was doing with this girl named Kim
I used to tell them
But he really never hit 'em till I quit 'em
I did the same thing to him
Now he wanna say

[Pre-Chorus]
What did I do? (What did I do?)
It's not what you did
It's what you didn't do, didn't do
What can I say? (What can I say?)
Not a word that'll get me back to you, back to you
Where did I go wrong? (Where did I go wrong?)
Well, remember the times when you didn't come home
I got tired of it, I'm sick of all this
When a woman's fed up
Ain't nothing you can do about it

[Chorus]
Go ahead with all of that
'Cause when you had me, you didn't want me
You just treated me bad
Go ahead with all of that
So what you saw me with somebody else, what?
You're supposed to be mad
You better go ahead with all of that
Baby, baby tough, turn around and walk right out the door
'Cause I gave you too many chances to fix our romance
But I don't want you no more
Go ahead with all of that
'Cause when you had me, you didn't want me
You just treated me bad
Go ahead with all of that
So what you saw me with somebody else, what?
You're supposed to be mad
You better go ahead with all of that
Baby, baby tough, turn around and walk right out the door
'Cause I gave you too many chances to fix our romance
But I don't want you no more

[Bridge]
This ain't something we can work out
Ain't nothing for you now to talk about
And to get as far from each other as we can
'Cause you don't know how to treat no lady
And you wanna act all crazy
Say the wrong words, do the wrong things
And expect me to take you back? No

[Chorus]
Go ahead with all of that
'Cause when you had me, you didn't want me
You just treated me bad
Go ahead with all of that
So what you saw me with somebody else, what?
You're supposed to be mad
You better go ahead with all of that
Baby, baby tough, turn around and walk right out the door
'Cause I gave you too many chances to fix our romance
But I don't want you no more
Go ahead with all of that
'Cause when you had me, you didn't want me
You just treated me bad
Go ahead with all of that
So what you saw me with somebody else, what?
You're supposed to be mad
You better go ahead with all of that
Baby, baby tough, turn around and walk right out the door
'Cause I gave you too many chances to fix our romance
But I don't want you no more (don't want you)
Go ahead with all of that
'Cause when you had me, you didn't want me
You just treated me bad
Go ahead with all of that
So what you saw me with somebody else, what?
You're supposed to be mad
You better go ahead with all of that
Baby, baby tough, turn around and walk right out the door
'Cause I gave you too many chances
