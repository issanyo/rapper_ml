[Refrain]
Im Looking for that
Pretty young thang
Up in the spot, looking hot playin` no games
And she steady tryina get it crunk right from the jump
And she playin` no games
That you Shawty? (yea thats me)
Did you come here to party? (Yes indeed)
Ha But could you drop it down low
When its time to get low
If so baby girl lets go
(Come and get it boy)

[Verse1]
They say I act old, but I got that old man game
Cause I stay tryina find me a pretty young thang
That I call anytime if she ready to hang
And if sun'it jump off she be ready to bang
I like `em fresh outta high school just about to graduate short shirts ed`day tryina show they little shape
Low cut jump jeans lugz on hea feet
Neighborhood girl but she love the streets
In a party she da main one doin dat right there
Ev'time hea jam drop hands up in the air
And she ain't thinkin you, she ain't thinkin bout her heart
And if you ballin' homie she dont even really curr
She got her mind set on what she wanna do
And she ain't come alone she got her whole little crew
Her P.Y.T's that'll make ya head spin
Ery nigga in the club tryina get in

[Refrain]
Im Looking for that
Pretty young thang
Up in the spot, looking hot playin` no games
And she steady tryina get it crunk right from the jump
And she playin` no games
That you Shawty? (yea thats me)
Did you come here to party? (Yes indeed)
Ha But could you drop it down low
When its time to get low
If so baby girl lets go
(Come and get it boy)

[Verse 2]
They got a whole lot of attitude
Rap is all that they listen to
Stays in the sweet tryina find somthin new
Custom ipods with the rhinestones
Nextel camara phones with all the hot ringtones
Light skin til black little PYT's
Boricua mami's that like to eat Mickey D's
Always into sumthin like NWA gota little bittie frame but home she dont play
You know a gyrl is the reason that a nigga wanna stunt
And im weak for em homie I ain't even gon front
See most young nigga's like em older not me spot they spot me like in the summer I run up hit them with
That Moss A game like "Baby wuz ya phone numba? Were ya live at? Shawdy what part of town? Cuz I just
Wanna be down!"

[Bridge]

Say Nah nanana "Nah nanana"

Say pretty young thangs repeat after me
