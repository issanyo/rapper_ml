[Verse 1: Tamika]
As I stand here contemplating
On the right thing to decide
Will I take the wrong direction
All my life, where will I go
What lies ahead of me?

[Verse 2:LaTocha]
I have strong determination
And I'm not afraid of change
I have yet to find that someone
Who would care to satisfy me
To stay right by me

[Hook]
Who can I run to
To share this empty space?
Who can I run to
When I need love?
Who can I run to
To fill this empty space with laughter?
Who can I run to
When I need love?

[Verse 2: Tamika+ LaTocha]
And my mind is so confusing
Who would be that special one?
Everyday I'm trying to find you
All along, I've got to know
Is there a place for me?

I know love has many names
And a message very clear
All it takes is time and patience
To bring you near
But who got me, tell me

[Hook]
Who can I run to
To share this empty space?
Who can I run to
When I need love?
Who can I run to
To fill this empty space with laughter?
Who can I run to
When I need love?
