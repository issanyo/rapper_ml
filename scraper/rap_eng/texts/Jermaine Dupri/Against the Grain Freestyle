[Intro:JAMRiV]
I ain’t gripping no grain
But I go against it
I swear
💧
Hmm. Hmm
👌🏾

[Verse 1:JAMRiV]
Molly Percocets, xans to my left
That was in the past
Copping gas every check
Out on my ass on my last lost respect
Who needs reassurance
When you know that you the shit
Riv love to flex on my right and my left
Riv ain’t tryna plex what we on
(connect, connect)
Parallel our lives so we never intersect
Keep my feet moving
Chop chop watch me jet
Coming for they necks Ta-Taking my respect
Ye-Yeah I earned that yea yeah I earned that
OG Kush game pack
I can’t wait to burn that
Put you on game
Wonder where I learned that
Leaves colored green
Golden showers when I pee
Don’t smoke black n milds
They don’t do shit for me
I love when hoes look but nigga
Please don’t look at me
I got flame for your sparks
But I’m the one who needs a ring
Placed on the pinky
Diamonds screaming blinky blink
Red rubies in the guts
Platinum cuts stinky stink
Everything from Johnny?
Tell em Bravo for the teeth
Say that I’m just lazy
I was resting for the spring

Better that than a hole in your head
Yea

[Verse 2:JAMRiV]
I wanna hoop built ass
In a coupe pilt gas ⛽️
Issa zoo if it’s giraffe
Long necks reach fast
Got scopes no binoculars
Wit a beam cause it’s popular
Pull a scene wit my oculars
Niggas know they ain’t stopping us
This a diamond like the roc in us
Good timing they was clockin us
You wonder why they mockin us
The birds here flocking us
So I just ate octopus
I ain’t just great Optimus
Sorry for the wait locking us
The pen and pad watchin us
Like aftermath doctor was
Waiting where the options was
Action just like Bronson was
Took a bath without a tub
Maybe when my dollars up
Holler hoes swallow us
Collars laid got enough
That’s why they all follow us
On the ground just like I’m scum
On my feet walking gum
Summer Steeze
Autumn come
Came inside dinners done
Lose some winners won
Choose on
Till it’s none
Shoes on get it done
Came for me, still ain’t run
Shottie gotta pump like Gucci
Camouflage flag like tunchie
Nigga keep thinking I’m goofy
Nesse on yo bitch no roofie
Bread no dough that’s truthfully
Just to get ahead don’t sue me
Say she like it raw no sushi
Might get the money and blow it
Say I’m not shit cause you knowing
You can go get it I throw it
Sort of like Diesel and Kobe
Referencing weed that I’m smoking
‘tis the season I’m joking
Please don’t touch my bag
Reach and touch my tags
You gone feel my wrath
Wonder why I’m mad
Fusion when we plex
Confusion she perplexed
Biting at my neck
Is this retrospect
I just need respect
Fave it give it back
Locked on like the latch
Tell them hoes I’m back
Still that four to five
But I don’t feel alive
Only when I’m high
Free smoke I’ve arrived
Feel like Mona Lisa
Perfect score I’ll teach ya
Act like I don’t need ya
When you know I need ya
Meat is what I feed ya
I need beats to feed up
Then I put my feet up
Keep in mind I’m greedy
Driving slow not speeding
Yo bitxh wanna see me
My bitch wanna bleed me
Think they said I’m easy
I’m still not agreeing
You the one that’s fleeing
Not hard to find believe me
Put the V in DD
NOW THEY WANNA SEE ME
MAGIC MIKE HOUDINI
PURPLE SMOKE LIKE GENIES 🧞‍♀️

[Verse:3 JAMRiV]
Had to find the original
Official one Issa go
My choppa love niggas
Issa wrap like a pita roll
Tell em bout my life
I wonder how you still figure tho
I wasn’t always perfect
You still know you my Nigga tho
Blue cheese I need you
Singing like I’m a bigger Moe
Boy where you really from
Leave you stuck like a sticker hoe
All All on my clique, Ne-Never gone switch
That’s a mistake, if you say that’s yo bitch
If they hear thoughts
Why I’m still here
When I wake up
I should pray for no fear
Still I wake up
And I’m glad you still here
Finally smiled shedded so many tears
Grandma I love you I know I been distant
Even when you standing here right in my kitchen
Blowing on L’s ima still give em hell
Had to go hard like a nigga on bail
I can make sales with no clientele
Pretty ass dolphin 🐬
Like I’m singing with the whales
Bitch I’m the man I am not a female
Told em that I’m grinding
Like skateboards on rails
Bitxh im the two like
Sonic and tails
Killing yo slugs like salt to a 🐌
