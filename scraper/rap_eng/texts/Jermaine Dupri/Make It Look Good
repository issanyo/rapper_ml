[Intro]
Oh, make me wanna say
Yeah, yeah
Oh, boy, you make me say

[Verse 1]
Something about you makes every girl high
Suffering without you
I just want a taste of what you got
But my mama always told me not to...

[Pre-Chorus]
Play with those players who play you
'Til there’s no more game left to be played
Look at what you got me going through
Can’t help myself because

[Chorus]
You make it look good (make it look good)
Say you make it look good
(Make it look gooder than them other fools)
Around you I know I ain't supposed to be
Acting like I know you notice me
Fantasise about the way you lick your lips
Fingertips on my hips as we dip
Oh, boy, you make it look good
(Make it look gooder than them other fools)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby, sometimes, I need you
But I feel so shy
Simply can't leave you
'Cause them other girls are gonna try
Guess their mama never told them not to...

[Pre-Chorus]
Play with those players who play you
'Til there’s no more game left to be played
Look at what you got me going through
Can’t help myself because

[Chorus]
You make it look good (make it look good)
Said you make it look good
(Make it look gooder than them other fools)
Around you I know I ain't supposed to be
Acting like I know you notice me
Fantasise about the way you lick your lips
Fingertips on my hips as we dip
Oh, boy, you make it look good
(Make it look gooder than them other fools)

[Outro]
Oh, boy
And it makes every girl high
Oh, boy, you make me say
Ooh, ooh you
Dear, my mama said "Don’t play with them players"
No, no
Look at what you got me going through
Fantasise about the way you lick your lips
Oh, it’s gooder than them other boys
Yes, it is
