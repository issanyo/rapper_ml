[Verse 1]
Every now and then, you may not know just when
You'll find a love that will treat you right
'CauseI'm so glad to say, that love just came my way
It was on a very special night

[Chorus]
Wednesday lover, wednesday lover, wednesday lover
There's no other, she's more than I would need (more than I got)
More than i ever would need, yeah
There's no other, there's no other, there's no other love that I need (there's no other) 3 love, no other
All that I know, she's the one, I know she's the one, know she's the one 4 me,yeah

[Verse 2]
And all my worldly days, I dare to never suppress
The way she makes me feel inside
A tender love so sweet
She makes my life complete
I always want her by my side

[Chorus]
Wednesday lover, wednesday lover, wednesday lover
There's no other, she's more than I would need (more than I got)
More than i ever would need, yeah
There's no other, there's no other, there's no other love that I need (there's no other) 3 love, no other
All that I know, she's the one, I know she's the one, know she's the one 4 me,yeah

[Verse 2]
It seems like all the other days, they take me much 2 far away
But I'm longing 4 you...you.... 4 you
Thursday, Friday, Saturday
I wish they all could run away, what am I 2 do
I wanna get back 2 you, oh, oh
With all my heatness, I dare never surpress
The way she makes me feel inside
A tender love so sweet
She makes my life complete
I always want her by my side

[Chorus]
Wednesday lover, wednesday lover, wednesday lover
There's no other, she's more than I would need (more than I got)
More than i ever would need, yeah
There's no other, there's no other, there's no other love that I need (there's no other) 3 love, no other
All that I know, she's the one, I know she's the one, know she's the one 4 me,yeah
Wednesday lover, wednesday lover, wednesday lover
There's no other, she's more than I would need (more than I got)
More than i ever would need, yeah
There's no other, there's no other, there's no other love that I need (there's no other) 3 love, no other
All that I know, she's the one, I know she's the one, know she's the one 4 me,yeah
