[Intro]
Oooooh, Damn!
I mean I just keep thinkin about you (awww baby)
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on (oh, oh, oh, ooooh)
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
And I don't know
But I'm a go ahead and talk about it
Listen

[Verse: 1 Bow Wow]
I'm sittin lookin out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
You still runnin through my mind - when I'm knowin that you shouldn't be
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowin that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even apalled
I still got alot of pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been runnin 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they lovin it
I'm likin it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it - I'm tryna let you go
I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm tryna let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm workin at it and it ain't gettin no better
Just tryna be like "yeah, forget it, whatever"
Instead of starrin out this glass - lookin at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...

[Hook - T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick, out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
I'm too attached my heart want let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doin?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas tellin'me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm tryin man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leavin with the hot shots
Knowin they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not poppin, and my brain ain't stoppin
Thinkin who she with?, or where she goin?, is she club hoppin?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealin with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and everytime you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Hook: Bow Wow]
Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been runnin thru my mind all day - can you feel me
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been runnin thru my mind all day  can you feel me
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

Hook: Bow Wow
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But I guess I gotta move on right?
Still hard, and I still love until this day.. Peace!
