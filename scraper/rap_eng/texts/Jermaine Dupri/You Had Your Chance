[Intro]
[?]

[Verse 1]
Well, it's been a while
Since I looked into your eyes
Never dreamed I'd see you tonight
And it's interesting that I
Just don't feel a thing
For the so called love of my life

[Pre-Chorus]
We used to be close
(But you didn't love me)
We used to be best friends
(But you never really cared)
I let you into my soul
(Didn't know you couldn't be trusted)
It took me so long to forget
(All the little things we shared)

[Chorus]
And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry, boy, but you had your chance

[Verse 2]
See, I spent so many sleepless nights
Trying to block you from my mind
I was so convinced
I'd die without you once upon a time
Now my eyes are open and I can see
You were devious and shady
Only trifling with me

[Pre-Chorus]
We used to be close
(But you didn't love me)
We used to be best friends
(But you never really cared)
I let you into my soul
(Didn't know you couldn't be trusted)
It took me so long to forget
(All the little things we shared)

[Chorus]
And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry, boy, but you had your chance

[Bridge]
Where were you when I needed you most?
Would've done anything to hold you close
Would've given the world to be back in your arms
But you left me so torn apart

[Chorus]
And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry, boy, but you had your chance

[Outro]
