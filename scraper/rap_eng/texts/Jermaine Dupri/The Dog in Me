[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm the hottest thing to hit the block since the ??
From CO to ATL I keeps it live
Like a fresh pair of 23's, once seen
Can't get enough of me, my team
Gettin this paper from all angles, which means
Everybody got a triangle, ya heard me?
I'm "The Truth" like Beans
And when it comes to teens in this rap thing
You lookin' at the rock
Not to mention that I'm hot, yeah you already know
And I shuts down the spot wherever I go
Call me the Tiger Woods of this, young and explosive
I come with the dopest flow at thirteen like whoa

[Chorus]
Little girls think that I'm delicious
Grown folks say I'm just too vicious, but they don't understand
It's just the dog in me
And that's just the way I am
Mess with me you get bit
In 2K, I ain't havin' it, what y'all don't understand?
It's just the dog in me
And that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Lil man with the big checks
Lil man that's got big girls wanting to teach me about sex
I don't care who comin', 'cause I'm here now
A hundred miles and runnin', Lil' Bow Wow
Drop bombs like Flex, constantly
And at 6 o'clock you can find me on Craig Street
Can't wait 'til I can see what the club be bout
Can't wait to get a whip so I can dub it out
I like no gold, I rock cornrows
The only way I know to hit the block is on swoll
Could never get enough dough so I keep grindin'
So I can keep shinin' and Big Tymin' like Baby

[Chorus]
Little girls think that I'm delicious
Grown folks say I'm just too vicious, but they don't understand
It's just the dog in me
And that's just the way I am
Mess with me you get bit
In 2K, I ain't havin' it, what y'all don't understand?
It's just the dog in me
And that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
Now my wallets too deep for y'all cats to swim
So if you copy me I'm dissin' you like Eminem
I mean straight to your face or live on TV
I might look cute, but it's the dog in me
That makes me wanna tear it up, everything in sight
Jump from girl to girl to stay out all night long
I'm little, but I, get my mack on
With my nick nack patty wack def backbone
Got everybody at home glued to they tube
Waitin to see what I drop new like Clue
'Cause when I do what I do I breaks the bank
'Cause a dog ain't a dog without a pile of stank

[Chorus]
Little girls think that I'm delicious
Grown folks say I'm just too vicious, but they don't understand
It's just the dog in me
And that's just the way I am
Mess with me you get bit
In 2K, I ain't havin' it, what y'all don't understand?
It's just the dog in me
And that's just the way I am
