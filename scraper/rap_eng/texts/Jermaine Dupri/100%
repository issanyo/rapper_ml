[Verse 1]
I am a dream, just beginning
Truth is I prayed when you'd open my eyes
And you revealed something to me
Suddenly I am no longer confined
My life ain't defined by limits
I don't need no permission to live it
I'm a break through the door 'til I get in
Everything that I got I'm a give it
100 Percent and I ain't stopping 'til I reach the finish

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a believer, not just a dreamer
I'm giving everything I got
I'm a go getter, 100 Percenter
Undoubtedly I can reach the top
And I ain't gonna let nothing discourage or dissuade me
Cause I'm walking out of here a champion either way, babe
I am givin it 100 Percent so go on put your ones up

[Chorus]
If you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up
If you know that this is something, put your ones up, ones up
If you really comprehend this, put your ones up, ones up
If you're walking into victory keep on shining
One hundred percent

[Verse 2]
You can only do it if you do it like I did
Cause suffering ain't easy
But if you can turn your wounds into living proof
That you've survived the fight and you no longer defined
My life ain't defined by limits
I don't need no permission to live it
I was a break thru the door till I get in
Everything that I got Ima give it
100 Percent and I won't stop till I reach the finish

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a believer, not just a dreamer
I'm giving everything I got
I'm a go getter, 100 Percenter
Undoubtedly I can reach the top
And I ain't gonna let nothing discourage or dissuade me
Cause I'm walking out of here a champion either way, babe
I am givin it 100 Percent, so go on put your ones up

[Chorus]
If you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up
If you know that this is something, put your ones up, ones up
If you really comprehend this, put your ones up, ones up
If you're walking into victory keep on shining
One hundred percent

[Bridge]
Don't you ever (stop)
Be discouraged (stop)
Let nobody take your courage (stop)
If you gonna pray don't worry (stop)
If you gonna wait don't pray (stop)
You just keep the faith and listen to me

[Chorus]
If you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up
If you know that this is something, put your ones up, ones up
If you really comprehend this, put your ones up, ones up
If you're walking into victory keep on shining
One hundred percent

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a believer, not just a dreamer
I'm giving everything I got
I'm a go getter, 100 Percenter
Undoubtedly I can reach the top
And I ain't gonna let nothing discourage or dissuade me
Cause I'm walking out of here a champion either way, babe
I am givin it 100 Percent, so go on put your ones up

[Chorus]
If you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up
If you know that this is something, put your ones up, ones up
If you really comprehend this, put your ones up, ones up
If you're walking into victory keep on shining
One hundred percent
