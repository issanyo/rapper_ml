[Verse 1]
Ah, hold up
Slow it down
I can see you're new in town
'Cause I'd never, forget you face
That smile you wear was amazin'
I just wanna know where you're headed
I can roll with you baby
Make some room in your life
I don't wanna take up time
So baby what's your name

[Chorus]
What's your name babe
Do you live around here
'Cause I ain't never seen you before
But I wanna see you some more
What's your name babe
Put it right in my Sidekick
And I'll hit you back
Soon as I get home

[Verse 2]
I'll put you in my favorites
The swag you got left a print
In my mind as time goes by
All I can think of you
Why you gotta be so fine
Wish I could see you again
Got me walkin' 'round
Lookin' for you, I'm trippin'
Damn what you do to me
Can't believe how you got me
And I don't even know your name

[Chorus]
What's your name babe
Do you live around here
'Cause I ain't never seen you before
But I wanna see you some more
What's your name babe
Put it right in my sidekick
And I'll hit you back
Soon as I get home

[Bridge]
You're not just some random guy
I can't let this moment pass me by
I gotta do what I gotta do
Take advantage, make the first move
'Cause I don't wanna have to regret it
I just wanna know your name

[Chorus]
What's your name babe
Do you live around here
'Cause I ain't never seen you before
But I wanna see you some more
What's your name babe
Put it right in my sidekick
And I'll hit you back
Soon as I get home
What's your name babe
Do you live around here
'Cause I ain't never seen you before
But I wanna see you some more
What's your name babe
Put it right in my sidekick
And I'll hit you back
Soon as I get home

[Outro]
Home
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, baby
