(Shame, It's a Shame!)

[Verse 1/Daddy Mac]
Hey yo, here's a real scoop, homie loc
Dumb fools around my way are gettin' high off gunsmoke
And I ain't talkin' about the high like endo
The kind of high to make you call your kinfolks
And tell them Oh, Johnny's dead
A fourteen-year-old kid put a nine to his head
All because he wanted that gear he was sporting
Gimme that, while you're at it, gimme them Jordans
Johnny tryin' to jet, homie wasn't hearing that
Johnny tryin' to run and got gatted in the back
Now tell me what happens to the way things used to be?
'Cause at this rate, there'll be no future, G
When will all of y'all learn
That if you play with fire too long, you're bound to get burned
This ain't a small thing I'm addressin'
It's a big thing, take it from the daddy as a lesson

[Hook]
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame alright
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a...

[Verse 2/Mac Daddy]
It's a shame the way this thing goes down
How one'll lay you down just to show he don't play around
He goes to sleep with a head full of anger
And wakes up a full-energized gang banger
I'm talkin' about a tisket, a tasket
Not knowing next day, he'll be laying in the casket
So what you think of that, son?
In the arcade, they playin' the games ain't fun
Something like Pac-man
Same name, but the game as you put it in the sack and
Running to the next board
And gat down the fools standing in the way of the door
There's no board and no points
And in this game, this is what Pac-man wants
The game, the ghosts are always blue
Then you'll slip up and they'll smoke you

[Hook]

{Verse 3/Mac Daddy}
None of this exist with the word peace (Brother)
You gotta do more than two fingers, man, please
Get a game that they gotta go by
Instead of "watch out quick, I send him to the sky"
There ain't nothing to be playin' with
So listen what I give and what I be sayin', kid
Take it from a kid's point of view
'Cause on my way to school, I be watching you

{Daddy Mac}
Big, big daddy in his caddy with all of his boys
It only had weeks, it's a joy
That's the first part, second part is havin' heart
And when you get caught, knowin' how to restart
You gotta know how to watch your back
'Cause if you slack, you're going in a sack
I advise y'all to watch out for the game
'Cause the game ain't nothin' but a..
