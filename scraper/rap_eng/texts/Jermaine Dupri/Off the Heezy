[JD]	Tyrese

[Tyrese]
All night long it's been hard for me to pay attention
To what me and my peoples are doing, eh
It's not often that I'm in this position
Though I've seen a lot, but not this hot
Girl, you've got me crazy

Repeat 1

[T]	Usually I don't pay no mind to girls this way
[Jd]	Me neither
[T]	But honey ain't your average little mommy
[JD] 	Oh

[Tyrese]
Just tryin' to find the right thing to say
Something tells me that if you and I got it poppin'
Girl, it won't be no stoppin'
It'll be one thing after the other

[JD]	This is the part I like right here

[Tyrese] (JD)
Were've you been
What I gotta do to see you again
Are the first words that came into my mind
I never met nobody as bad as you (That's right)
Who ain't got no attitude
That's what makes the situation, for sure

[JD]
Uh-oh
It's that cat from the south
Everybody just can't stop talkin' about
Lips stay poked out cuz I cannot lose
Every record I make, I got something to prove
It's a man's world, so don't even trip real big
Ya'll know how I do this shit
And I'm the truth like a California bag of trees
From ATL to Watts nigga, off the heez'

Repeat 1
Repeat 1 while:
[JD]
Tyrese
JD
Yeah
Oh
Uh huh

[T]	I wanna get it started oh
