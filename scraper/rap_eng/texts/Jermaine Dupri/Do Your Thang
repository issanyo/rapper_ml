If the music make you move
And you take the groove
Groove on, groove on
If you feel like you wanna make love
Under the stars above, love on, love on
If there's something you wanna say
And talkin' is the only way
Rap on, oh, rap on
'Cause whatever you do
Hey, do your thing, do your thing
If you feel like you wanna scream
And that's your way of lettin' off steam
Scream on, scream on
If you feel like you wanna sing
And singing is your thing
Sing on, sing on
If you wanna make love all night
And you feel that it's right
Right on, right on 'cause whatever you do
Hey, do your thing, do your thing
How, let me do my thing
