Right now
I gotta rep. where im from
North south
Yeah
Ghetto
Minneapolis ghetto
Im from da ghetto
You know how we do it
For my people down south wit gold in their mouth
For my people out east with the key in the couch
For my people out west who be bangin it out
We ghetto (ghetto) ghetto (ghetto)
For all my ladies that got air brush on they nails
A little fire on sunday, on his cell
Smoke a little weed say its good for they health
We ghetto (ghetto) ghetto (ghetto)
I didn't always have the sex
I didn't always have the crib
I gotta rep where im from
Even though i live where i live
Back when i was a kid
How the city used to give
Momma money for groceries
Credit cards and G's
And vouchers for everything

No matter how far I've come
I still represent where I'm from
I'm ghetto

For my people down south wit gold in their mouth
For my people out east with the key in the couch
For my people out west who be bangin it out
We ghetto (ghetto) ghetto (ghetto)
For all my ladies that got air brush on they nails
A little fire on sunday, on his cell
Smoke a little weed say its good for they health
We ghetto (ghetto) ghetto (ghetto)
