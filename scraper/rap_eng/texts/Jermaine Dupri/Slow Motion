[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
I had this girl in my room right
She was trying to do it, do it too fast
I said slow down, you know what she said
She said uh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah So So Def
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, So So Def
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, So So Def
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, So So Def

[Verse 1: Jagged Edge]
Lately I think I like the way that you give it to me
You try to please me
But you should know one thing that's for sure
You're just my sweet lay back for me
Anything you feel, baby I got right here
And you ain't gotta look no more
I'ma take my time blow your mind
As I do it to you slow, baby come on

[Pre-Chorus: Jagged Edge]
If you want it, I got it
Better believe that I'm never leavin' home without it
If you want it, I got it
Better believe that I'm never leavin' home without it

[Chorus: Jagged Edge]
We can do it slow motion
Take a sip of my love potion
We can do it in slow motion
We can have so much fun
If we keep it slow motion

[Verse 2: Jagged Edge]
This day and time everything seem so fast to me
I like the way that you take your time
Like the way I feel when we
Kissin' and huggin'
So exciting, tempature risin' the heat
Let's take our time
We'll do it right, baby I'm all that you need

[Pre-Chorus: Jagged Edge]
If you want it, I got it
Better believe that I'm never leavin' home without it
If you want it, I got it
Better believe that I'm never leavin' home without it

[Chorus: Jagged Edge]
We can do it slow motion
Take a sip of my love potion
We can do it in slow motion
We can have so much fun
If we keep it slow motion

[Outro: Jagged Edge]
Come with me
Hey baby it's J.E
What do we have here now
Something to pump in your mind
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Come with me
Hey baby it's J.E
What do we have here now
Something to pump in your mind
La, la, la, la, la, la
