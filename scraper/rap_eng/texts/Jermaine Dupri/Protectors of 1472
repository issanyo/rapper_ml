Biiiiiiiiiach
What cha wanna do (2x)
We the Legion of Doom
(3x)

Warren G:
1472 is the same cut throat and locs
And plenty dopes can you cope?
You can call me Count Chocula
I control all the bitches, Chi-Chi control the riches
And Fly serve the snitches

[Verse One: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Look up in the sky it's the Fly
My herion whip, clip on hip, now trip on this
A bunch of outlaws try to take my town
Set up shop, run me out, and cut me down
And how that sound?
When I'm the illest superhero
Born and raised on that muthafucking underground
Brrrrbrrrrbrrrr stick 'em, ha haha stick 'em
Try to catch me slipping but now you 'bout to be my victim
I'm not Aquaman but I aqua-boogie
I'm sorta like a monster, chasin' cookies
And I spin a web any size you can call me to fly
I walk walls and this is for all my dogs
(WOOF!)
I'm like the wonder twins, my style activates
The many niggas get in it and try to paper hate
It's fly, the rider man the rider man
I do it like a muthafucking rider and
I represent all the time and
I represent the mad ass fuckin' eastside
(eastside) -look out, look out, come out
Cause here comes the rider man
(rider man), nigga

[Verse Two: Jermaine Dupri]
I rock the blue cake on 'em, drop the weight on 'em
The more they hate, the more I elevate on 'em
I swerve and collect, serve and protect
Never hit the streets without the ice on my neck
I'm all about partying, hoes, and getting paper
They call me Chi-Chi, I do it up cape crusader
Contact through the frame no mistakes
To bank rules back in town and it's on us to shut 'em down
Now Fly what cha wanna do?

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Nigga what?
Let's put this shit down my lil' homey Mr. Turner with the burner
He got my back you know he put me up on game
When they get up, they getting lit up, he tear shit up
Enough said, don't tell it, just sell it
We blowin' in the wind and we gonna ride til' we win
Young soldier stay into it we put the Folger
It's your turn, gon' get on up and get the 'Lac
And don't forget to grab your strap

[Hook: Snoop]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, no it ain't
It's the Legion of Doom and ain't a damn thing changed
Keep it safe and sound, get it locked down
And you don't have to worry when we in your town
(2x)

[Verse Three: R.O.C.]
Just a young muthafucker from the street
Forced to be a G-angsta, knock-knock with  a Glock, pump-pump answer
Throw your hands up nigga, yeah death's a callin
Went from petty theft bank robber straight to ballin'
Stomp with us, walk with us as we bust through
The doors, .44's like parts in us
Often us, street heroes got many hoes and
Plenty dope plus we fly as fuck
Duct tape wire him up, toe tag 'em
Have him feel the strength of a black magnum
Body bag him, nobody is as bad as them
It's on, eff them, set Kissed like FM
Life in 1-4-7 to the deuce, right then
I slipped in the bullet-proof suit
And swoop down on the bank ruler with the gats
Waiting for the permission to cancel his ass
Handle his ass
I love to see his guts and his blood spill
And crack the fuck up
As I rise flying up high with a .45
Infared beaming on him from the sky
Drop and I put the barrel right between his eyes
Said, "You fuck with the Legion and now you must die."
We serve and protect all the hustlers and G's
From the west to the north, south and back to the east

[Hook]

Look up in the sky (in the sky)
No it ain't (no it ain't, no it ain't)
Mean a damn thing changed (changed, changed, changed)
Got it locked down (locked down, locked down)
When we in your town (in your town)

Look up in the sky (in the sky)
No it ain't (no it ain't, no it ain't)
Mean a damn thing changed (changed, changed, changed)
Got it locked down (locked down, locked down)
And you won't have to worry when we in your town (in your town....)
