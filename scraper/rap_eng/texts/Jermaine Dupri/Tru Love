[Verse 1]
6 years, 5 months
That's how long we've been having this thing we've got
Every moment hasn't been perfect
But still when it's perfect it feels
Like we're the only two people who have something real
Now 3 years 2 weeks
That's how long we've been raising our family
And I wouldn't go trading
The love that we got
So don't go changing
I love you just the way you are

[Chorus]
It's true love
When you say you need me
Like I need you
And you can't be without me
Like I can't be without you
It's true love
When we spend time talking on the phone
'Cause when we're not around each other
We don't wanna to be alone
It's true love, love, love, love
Don't you know it's good to be in love, love, love, love
Just belive me truthfully 'cause
Love is never ever making you cry
Before I tell you a lie
I'll give you my life
'Cause that's true love

[Verse 2]
Now when the love is right
Somehow you just know
Because you hold it tight
And you don't want to let it go
And it's so deep inside of you that
You just can't take it 'cause it fills up your heart
And you just, you can't replace it, oh no
Somebody's making love
Non-stop tonight
And they can't make enough
I know what it feels like
Grab your lover by the hand
Say that you understand
How love really works
So good that it hurts

[Chorus]
It's true love
When you say you need me
Like I need you
And you can't be without me
Like I can't be without you
It's true love
When we spend time talking on the phone
'Cause when we're not around each other
We don't wanna to be alone
It's true love, love, love, love
Don't you know it's good to be in love, love, love, love
Just belive me truthfully cause
Love is never ever making you cry
Before I tell you a lie
I'll give you my life
'Cause that's true love

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't need nobody but you in my life, oh baby
(oh no no, no no no no)
Those of you that understand what I'm sayin'
Sing along with me say
'Cause I don't need nobody but you in my life, oh baby
(oh no no, no no no no)
Those of you that understand what I'm sayin'
Sing along with me say

[Chorus]
It's true love
When you say you need me
Like I need you
And you can't be without me
Like I can't be without you
It's true love
When we spend time talking on the phone
'Cause when we're not around each other
We don't wanna to be alone
It's true love, love, love, love
Don't you know it's good to be in love, love, love, love
Just belive me truthfully cause
Love is never ever making you cry
Before I tell you a lie
I'll give you my life
'Cause that's true love
