[Intro:]
Everything you like is with me
So if you know like I know
This is where you need to be

[Chorus:]
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home, who he goes to see?
Or why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone?
Leaves you alone?
(He's with me)
Do you ever wonder when he, don't come home
Who he goes to see?
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone?
Cuz everything he like is with me

[Verse: Beyonce]
If I was in your shoes
I would'a had to let him know
(From the first sign of him tryin' to play)
If you want me to stay
Ya gotta let all that go
(Oh but no), you wanna stick around
And not believe in what you see
And why you (waitin')
Thinkin' everything's gonna be okay
I got him, I got him (right here with me)
Oh, oh

[Chorus:]
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home, who he goes to see?
Or why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone
Leaves you alone
(He's with me)
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home, who he goes to see?
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone?
Cuz everything he like is with me

[Verse: Kelly]
I wanna call you so bad
And tell you (where it started)
And what we do
How long it's been going on
Why (he ain't gon' never come home)
Cuz I know what you didn't do
To make him stay
See a bad performing, unfullfilling woman
Drives a man away

[Chorus:]
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home, who he goes to see?
Or why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone
Leaves you alone
(He's with me)
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home, who he goes to see?
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone?
Cuz everything he like is with me

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Now as far as I know
He's in good hands
So you can (stop callin' all around)
Sayin' "Have you seen my man?" (have you seen my man?)
Ain't no need to fuss and fight
Tryin' to make it right
No!
Certain things ain't meant to be
And that's why, that's why, he's right here with me

[Break: Jermaine Dupri]
Everything you like is with me
So if you know like I know
This is where you need to be
Everything you like is with me
So if you know like I know
This is where you need to be
Everything you like is with me
So if you know like I know
This is where you need to be
Everything you like is with me
So if you know like I know
This is where you need to be

[Beyonce:]
Do you wonder?

[Chorus:]
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home, who he goes to see?
Or why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone
Leaves you alone
(He's with me)
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home, who he goes to see?
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone?
Cuz everything he like is with me

[Outro: Beyonce]
Everything he like is with me
(Do you ever wonder when he)
Everything he like is with me
Everything he likes
(And why in the middle of the night)
(He leaves you alone, he leaves you alone)
Everything he likes...
Everything, everything...
