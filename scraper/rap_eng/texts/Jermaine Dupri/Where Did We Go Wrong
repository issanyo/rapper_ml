Is it something I did?
Or is it something I said?
Is it something you heard?
Is it something that I'm missing?

Tell me what's going on
Baby, where did we go wrong?
Tell me what's up
Baby, don't give up
Can you just hear my song?

It's been a minute since you told me that you loved me
You used to stay home every night
But now you're in the streets
I'm hearing rumors 'bout you creeping with some chick named Destiny
(I can tell you how it feels to be lonely now)

I'm so fed up with all your lies
And you deceiving me
You act like you don't even remember how we used to be
Like we never existed
Like you don't even miss it
What did I do to make you treat me this way?

Is it something I did?
Or is it something I said?
Is it something you heard?
Is it something that I'm missing?

Tell me what's going on
Baby, where did we go wrong?
Tell me what's up
Baby, don't give up
Can you just hear my song?

Is it something I did?

Tell me what's going on
Baby, where did we go wrong?
Tell me what's up
Baby, don't give up
Can you just hear my song?

You used to buy me things to see the smile on my face
But lately you've only done things to make my smile erase
Always fussing & fighting
You don't care when I'm crying
And I don't know why we took this turn for the worse

Baby, let me know something
Cause I don't understand
I love you and I'm willing to fix this any way I can
But you gotta tell me what's going on
Why do you treat me this way?
I wanna know where I went wrong

Is it something I did?
Or is it something I said?
Is it something you heard?
Is it something that I'm missing?

Tell me what's going on
Baby, where did we go wrong?
Tell me what's up
Baby, don't give up
Can you just hear my song?

Can you just hear my song?

Something ain't right
There's no use in denying
I just don't know why we always fussing & fighting

Baby, what is wrong?
It feels as though I'm dying inside
Without you by my side
Baby, I'm crying

Something ain't right
There's no use in denying
I just don't know why we always fussing & fighting

Baby, what is wrong?
It feels as though I'm dying inside
Without you by my side
Baby, I'm crying
