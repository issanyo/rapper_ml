[Chorus: Debra Killings]
Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade

[Verse 1: Da Brat]
If ya thirstay I could possibly slide down your throat
If you work may let's say we skip the foreplay
Picture me kicking in the doorway to set off the storay
NegligГ©e hot tip of the knockers stay brick like rocks
Figure if you drop ice here I don't stop
Cuz its twice as nice when its frosted up
Sweetness like this could never cost enough
With a so so twist try this stuff
Mouth watering love succulent to all taste buds
Must of been us you was dreaming of the crush
I breeve on 'em and make 'em feel the lust
Then jiggle the lemons a little so they feen to touch
Cream to us say nuh thing to us scared
Premium pink stuff and swing with us sweetened it up
To it make you wanna say ooh its cool

[Chorus: Debra Killings]
Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade
Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
I'm weighed in at one tree five a big gulp size
Seven eleven can't satisfy your appetite all night
JD and I planned it to be dickable so its alright
You can come and escapade in my escalade
Lay me flat on my back and slurp away
I get action in a Bentley with no brains
Just pure satisfaction cracking with no cain
I came for the thrill of it I ain't looking for real love
Just the feel of it
After just one taste you still bugging
Da black cat make you wanna handle business
Until the pleasure principle kick it it
If you hit this I'll make you tell your wife and your mistress
To leave town cuz they been evicted
Hit up a record store pick up Brat and get addicted

[Chorus: Debra Killings]
Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade
Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade

[Verse 3: Da Brat]
A thirst quenching mouth watering concoction
Your only option drink to ya pink why stop it
One think its refreshing isn't it the best when you sipping it
Heaven sake honey buns built for dipping in
Money come quicker than a two minute brother
That concentrate on stiffin' when he love it
Stick when too dry so keep sturring
It still be the sweet even if it turn syrup
Hurry up and get a cup full cop fills and get' cha cap peeled back
Rash a little rat first smash went classic
Even with my homies hlep on the west you wack
Sincerely Brat where my girls at
We stick together in the rain
Batches of pink lemonade bringing da pain
Any day and every minute make you wanna get up in it
Cuz its just that cool

[Chorus: Debra Killings]
Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade
Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade
Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade
Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade
