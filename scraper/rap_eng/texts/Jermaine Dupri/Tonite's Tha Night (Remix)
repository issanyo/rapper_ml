Yeah, party people, I say, yeah, party people
Kris Kross, '95
Yeah, party people, I say, yeah, party people
Who gotcha open, scopin' out the track?
It's no other than the sounds of the Daddy Mack
Still slackin', back patchin' up my turf
'Cause after me was a factor real worse at the worst
Stompin', jumpin' wannabes
But ever however there's only one M A C
Me an' Daddy for the big picture
Ways of gettin' richer, mister, quick to hit your sister
I'm ballin' in the Green County on chrome
I slip brothers on the deck on my cellular phone
I'm just loungin', leather, sound all around
An' a dip on the other end wanna put me down now
No hesitation, I hops to it
See it ain't easy bein' a Mac but somebody gotta do it
True, it's usually not represented right
But I'm the M A C D A double D Y an' tonite's tha night
Please, my whole crew makes Gs
Tonite's tha night, baby, so blow up on these
Tonite, tonite's tha night
Tonite's tha night
Please, my whole crew makes Gs
Tonite's tha night, baby, so blow up on these
Tonite, tonite's tha night
Tonite's tha night I call up all the girls
I used to go to school with, fool with
An' all the niggas that I'm cool with
Let 'em all know that my moms is gone
An' it will be tomorrow before she comes back home
Ding dong, it's on, nigga, say no more
I'm with a truck full of women, so just open the door
'Cause yo, we came here to party
Get it crunk, get drunk an' leave your house with somebody
An' true that, so homies don't bring your main missus
'Cause it's real deal mackin' when it comes to the Kris's
An' this could be your very last time seein' her
One look at me an' you better believe that I be G'n her
So come alone or don't come at all
'Cause it's real big pimpin' at this playa's ball
True, it's usually not represented right
But with me, it's all to the G an' tonite's tha night
Please, my whole crew makes Gs
Tonite's tha night, baby, so blow up on these
Tonite, tonite's tha night
Tonite's tha night
Please, my whole crew makes Gs
Tonite's tha night, baby, so blow up on these
Tonite, tonite's tha night
Tonite, yeah, party people, I say, yeah, party people
Tonite's tha night
Yeah, party people, I say, yeah, party people
Tonite's tha night
Get ready, for what? Tonite
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, tonite
Gonna make this a night to remember
Tonite, I say, yeah, party people
I say, yeah, party people
Young, young, rich, rich, dangerous
I hear voices sayin'
The world is yours, nigga, get it now
Get in the game, do your thing
An' don't stop until it's locked downâ€
Young, young, rich, rich, dangerous
