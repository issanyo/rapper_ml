[Intro: JD]
See baby you're my little secret
If you don't tell, I won't tell
And that's how we gotta keep it

[Verse 1: Kandi]
Did anybody see you coming to my house last night?
When I got your message on my beeper
That you wanna do everything I like
Alright, alright

[Bridge: LaTocha]
I like being in the same room as you and your girlfriend
The fact that she don't know
That really turns me on
She'll never guess in a million years
That we've got this thing going on

[Chorus]
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
It's on everybody's mind, about you and I
They think so, but they don't really know
Or wanna know that
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
We should never let 'em know
Never let it show
If you know, like I know
We should never let it go

[Verse Two: Tiny]
If anybody knew that it was you and your house
That I was creepin' to all the time
I'd probably still do it
Cause I find it hard to keep you off of my mind

[Bridge: LaTocha]
I like being in the same room as you and your girlfriend
The fact that she don't know
That really turns me on
She'll never guess in a million years
That we've got this thing going on

[Chorus]
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
It's on everybody's mind, about you and I
They think so, but they don't really know
Or wanna know that
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
We should never let 'em know
Never let it show
If you know, like I know
We should never let it go

[Break: Kandi)]
Everybody cheats
But you gotta know how, you gotta know when
You gotta know why my infatuation with you
Is taking me on an emotional high
I'm caught all up in this love affair baby
Speculation will bring us stares
All my friends are asking me about it
Still the truth I can't reveal

[Chorus]
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
It's on everybody's mind, about you and I
They think so, but they don't really know
Or wanna know that
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
We should never let 'em know
Never let it show
If you know, like I know
We should never let it go

[Bridge 2]
As long as I'm right here
You ain't never gonna be by yourself
Cause the love that we share
It stays on my mind
You're always gonna be a little secret of mine
As long as I'm right here
You ain't never gonna be by yourself
Cause the love that we share
It stays on my mind
You're always gonna be a little secret of mine

[Chorus]
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
It's on everybody's mind, about you and I
They think so, but they don't really know
Or wanna know that
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
We should never let 'em know
Never let it show
If you know, like I know
We should never let it go
