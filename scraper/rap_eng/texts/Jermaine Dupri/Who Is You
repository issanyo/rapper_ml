[Chorus: Miss Mulatto]
Who is you?
You's a dub
You ain't gang, gang, gang
Who is you?
If I don't know you
You's a lame, lame, lame
Who is you?
Betta stay off in yo lane, lane, lane
Who is you?
Don't nobody know yo name, name, name
Who is you?
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)

[Verse 1: Miss Mulatto]
Tripping if you think you competition
You'll get buried with the rest of em
I know I'm the best of em all
No service, like a phone that can't call
You will get, you will get
You will get dropped
On the Southside, need a pass, no hall
You will get clapped
Like a round of applause
You got no stain, ain't talkin bout drawers
Flow is so sick, I ain't talkin about halls
All that I speak is facts
Whatever I do, they repeating that
I will Meek Mill you like back to back
Huh, now who disagree with that?
Huh, just what I thought
I do not care what you got
You can get a writer, a fighter, a flighter, Al Qaeda
But you still ain't taking my spot
Lil bitty bih
Now who want next on the hit list
Suicide if you diss this
I want 10 racks if I blow a kiss
Spitting bullets and I won't miss
Wipe a lil baby, no napkin
And I ain't sparing no kids
Especially if they rapping

[Chorus: Miss Mulatto]
Who is you?
You's a dub
You ain't gang, gang, gang
Who is you?
If I don't know you
You's a lame, lame, lame
Who is you?
Betta stay off in yo lane, lane, lane
Who is you?
Don't nobody know yo name, name, name
Who is you?
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)

[Verse 2: Miss Mulatto]
Shawty, who is you?
I do not know nothing bout you
Flow so sick like ah-choo
I like Robin's and True's
You can't do what I do huh
You can't move how I move huh
Call up my bro's like I got a problem since I got you
They laughing at you
I'm laughing to the bank
I do what I do
I don't care what nobody think
When I'm steppin up on the stage
Deeper than the ocean, no frank
Princess of the Southside my rank
And it's Black Opps if you think it's a game
Hottest kid out
And you know that's a fact
Write my own checks
Like I write my own raps
Coming for me
Man you betta come strapped
Spitting these bullets
So you will get clapped
Put the bars to em, bet they get back
Breaking records, you can call it Kit Kat
Killing rappers three ti-ti times in a row
Call it tic-tac-toe

[Hook: Miss Mulatto]
Who is you?
You's a dub
You ain't gang, gang, gang
Who is you?
If I don't know you
You's a lame, lame, lame
Who is you?
Betta stay off in yo lane, lane, lane
Who is you?
Don't nobody know yo name, name, name
Who is you?
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
I do not know you
(Who is you)
