[Intro]
Nine six, it's Da Brat nigga
We jackin these niggas for they beats and shit

[Verse 1]
Niggas know when they see the afro sym-boool they embrace themselves
Lock doors and hold their breath
For the black on black beamer drivin
Shitin on niggas time after time
And on da west side is confinement

However you gotta get it get it without getting stuck...

'Cause life ain't shit if you can't live it up, live it up

[Verse 2]
The next destination is to be the greatest heavyweight and undisputed
Due to dem other bitches to the back of the bus with nothing much to it
My milli0ons my main concern fucka factions and hurting feelings
Its niggas that'll care just to kick it
With a real bitch gettin' real rich quick
Live it up to the fullest notch set up the plot
Life expect to see levels drop its on again and it don't stop
Anotha tantrum for crematin' mothafuckas in random
Leavin' none standin keep da big willies hold'em for grants
The money it cost to be boss is high my all time condition
To da day I die that's why I be the best for this position listen
Cleavage decorated wit ice flooded pieces
I live for drop top corneshes and new releases
Bouncin in little islands I can't even pronounce
Way out laid out by da beach smokin a whole fuckin ounce
This nigga stay jiggie flashy my name ain't baby

'Cause life ain't shit if you can't live it up, live it up
