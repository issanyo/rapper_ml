(Sample)
Break 'em off somethin'

(Intro: Daddy Mac)
Once again it's on!
Kris Kross, Totally Krossed Out
And with no doubt, we came here to

(Hook: Mac Daddy and Daddy Mac)
Ah, Rock rock y'all (Rock y'all)
2 Da Beat Ch'yall (Beat Ch'yall)
Boom, yeah it don't stop!
Rock rock y'all (Rock y'all)
2 Da Beat Ch'yall (Beat Ch'yall)
Boom, yeah it don't stop!

(Verse 1: Mac Daddy)
And then they said we would pop, but we just pop the dough, they wish that they had a "Jump"
That they could pop, move your set, move your neck and lay in your trunk
(Rough!) if it ain't (Tough!), nigga it ain't me
My lyrics'll make D-E-A-D A-B-C, now who's a wanna-be?
Definitely not this little nappy-headed kid from Atlanta
Just scrap more and then we drop a can, uh
With a lyrical thrust as I bust these rough rhymes
Whoever dissed the Kris can kiss where the sun don't shine
(Uhh!) The double K's are back to amaze
Sharper than a machete's tip and highly praised

(Daddy Mac)
Never the less, I stress that I am the best
I get so many props they call me Daddypoppadopalis!
(D-A) Double D (Y) M-A-C
Strong, rockin' house, rock and gift to the ladies!

(Mac Daddy)
Kris 2 Da Kross ain't playin' son
If we hear a diss from another group we slayin' 'em

(Mac Daddy and Daddy Mac)
'Cause in the bar we don't take that junk
So ya better mind ya business and just pump the funk!

(Hook: Mac Daddy and Daddy Mac)
And Rock rock y'all (Rock y'all)
2 Da Beat Ch'yall (Beat Ch'yall)
Boom, yeah it don't stop!
Rock rock y'all (Rock y'all)
2 Da Beat Ch'yall (Beat Ch'yall)
Boom, yeah it don't stop!
Rock rock y'all (Rock y'all)
2 Da Beat Ch'yall (Beat Ch'yall)
Boom, yeah it don't stop!
Rock rock y'all (Rock y'all)
2 Da Beat Ch'yall (Beat Ch'yall)
Boom, yeah it don't stop!

(Verse 2: Daddy Mac)
They call me the D, (The A), D to the D (Y)
'Cause I'm the loveable huggable type of guy!
Here I come, with somethin' for your trunk
As if ya didn't know Daddy Mac make ya wanna Jump!
Bring it back, let me ride the track
And if ya don't like it you can swing on my sack
I'm the little nigga that be runnin' the show
And like we told you before take your wack style to the sto'

(Mac Daddy)
So back up, back up, or get ya smack up, smack up
And let this little nigga named Mac rip the track up
Coming from the dungeon, I'm pungent, I'll ride for you
Atlanta too, for the crew, old school and new
With my imperial material, I come (Rough!)
Come (Tough!), hold your breath so (Huff huff and puff puff!)
'Cause my style is always pumpin'
And I'm the miggida miggida mac, known to break 'em off somethin'

(Hook: Mac Daddy and Daddy Mac)
Rock rock y'all (Rock y'all)
2 Da Beat Ch'yall (Beat Ch'yall)
Boom, yeah it don't stop!

2 Da Beat Ch'yall (Beat Ch'yall)
Boom, yeah it don't stop!

(Outro: Mac Daddy)
Nuh, nuh, nuh, Now, the formalities are still the same, ain't nuthin' changed
And I don't wanna hear you ever, EVER, say that Kris Kross don't break 'em off somethin' (Huh)
