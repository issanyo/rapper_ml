Party time
Okay, party people in the house

Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party

I was at this club, this place called Roy's
I snuck in past my curfew trying hang with the big boys
There were hands swingin', people singin' and others on the wall
Disco lights blinkin' and people big and small

Security finally caught me, talkin' 'bout "Son you're kinda young"
I said, "Beat this Mr. Officer I'm just trying to have some fun"
Now on my way out, this girl said, "Whuddup shorty?"
I broke away from the officer and then said, "Girl, it's time to party"
You know

Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party

Next I went to a club to see what he said I was missin'
Snuck through the back door, it was like "Yeah, I can get with this"
A whole bunch of cuties surrounded by a bunch of moles
With dreadlocks, bell bottoms and a couple wearing Afros

Now I was Krossed Out, totally fly to the T
Getting all the girlies then I got caught by security
He grabbed me up and said, "Yo, I just kicked out your friend
And I don't want to see you and him around here ever again trying out"

Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party

Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party

Okay party people in the house
Okay party people in the house
Yeah, part

One night we both decided that we would go together
Totally Krossed Out, into more Krossed Out leather
Now I was lookin' fly from head to toe
And all we both could think about was reaching the back door

We were lookin' diggy diggy doe ready to rock
You know?
But when got to the back door
Oh, the back door shouldn't have be locked

Now Kris was getting mad, but I had other thoughts
Of ways of getting in
When I was getting caught
So we could

Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party

Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party

Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah
