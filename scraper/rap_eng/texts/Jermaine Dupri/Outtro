Kris Kross? You see these kids?
They wear their clothes backwards
12 years old with earrings?
Who taught these kids how to dress?
Do their parents dress this way?
My kids better not dress like this
I don't know, it must be- must be an Atlanta thing
They wear their clothes four sizes too big
Gotta be a fad
Hey, I used to wear bell bottoms
At least I didn't have to unzip my butt to take a leak
So anyway, look out for this look they call totally krossed out
