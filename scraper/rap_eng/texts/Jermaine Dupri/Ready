[Verse 1]
No, I'm done cheating
No, I'm done creeping
Trya get it out of my life
Time to give myself right
And I know some gon' be mad
And some people gon' be sad
But they will be alright
I thank God I found my wife
I won't be the one who's 50 and alone
I'ma have my family by my side 'til I'm dead and gone
Somebody say alright, alright, alright, alright
(Alright, alright, alright, alright)
I'm so ready to start this life

[Chorus]
Girl, I never thought I'd say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
If you think I'm trippin' when I say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
I'm ready to ring you up
Think, I think, I think, I'm ready to feel your love
Think, I think, I think, I'm ready to be in love
Think I'm ready to be in love

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm done, done misleadin'
My karma took a beatin'
I can't go back and change things that was
Baby, starting here  today
I'm changin' all the way
I'm racing fast forward to your love, love, love, love, love
And I won't be the one who's miserable and alone (And alone)
I won't be the one who, I won't be the one
And I can't sing this our life long as you on the song
Never thought I'd hear the words out of my mouth

[Chorus]
Girl, I never thought I'd say this
I think I'm ready to be in love (I'm ready to be in love)
If you think I'm trippin' when I say this (I'm not trippin' when I say this)
I think I'm ready to be in love (I think I'm ready to be in love)
I'm ready to ring you up
Think, I think, I think, I'm ready to feel your love
Think, I think, I think, I'm ready to be in love
Think I'm ready to be in love (Ready to be in love, yeah)

[Bridge]
When I said yes, I mean for real
Not like the other times in my life, I couldn't deal
She brings the best out of me
Baby, she's the reason for this
It's only 'cause this, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm ready to be in love
I'm so ready, baby
I'm ready to be in love, oh
I'm so ready, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm ready, yeah, yeah, babe
I'm ready, ready, ready-ready
Ready

[Chorus]
Girl, I never thought I'd say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
If you think I'm trippin' when I say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
I'm ready to ring up you
Think, I think, I think, I'm ready to feel your love
Think, I think, I think, I'm ready to be in love
Think I'm ready to be in love
