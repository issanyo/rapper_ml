You should know, you should know that ahhh
Kris Kross is not having anything today
As we stand there totally krossed out
We commence to make you (Jump Jump)
The Mac Dad'll make you (Jump Jump)
The Daddy Mac'll make you (Jump Jump)
Kris Kross'll make you (Jump Jump)

[Verse 1: Mac Daddy]
Don't try to compare us to another bad little fad
I'm the Mac and I'm bad give you something that you never had
I'll make ya bump hump wiggle and shake your rump
Cause I'll be kicking the flavor that makes you wanna Jump
How high? Real high! Cause I'm just so fly
A young lovable, hugable type of guy
And everything is to the back with a little slack
Cause inside out, it's wiggida wiggida wiggida wack
I come stompin' with somethin' pumpin' to keep you jumpin'
'R&B-rap is bullcrap' is what I'm dumpin'
Ain't nuthin' soft about Kris Kross, we all that
So when they ask, "Do they rock?," say, "Believe that!"

[Verse 2: Daddy Mac]
I like my stuff knockin' (knockin')
I love it when the girlies be like jockin' (jockin')
The D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C
Yeah, you know me
I got you jumpin' an' bumpin' an' pumpin' movin' all around, G
In the mix, I made MC's step back
They tried to step to the Mac then they got jacked
To the back you'll be sportin' the gear; is that coincidental?
Act like you know and don't be claiming that it's mental
Two lil' kids with a flow you ain't ever heard
And nuttin' fake and you can understand every word
As you listen to my cool, smooth melody
The Daddy makes you J-U-M-P
