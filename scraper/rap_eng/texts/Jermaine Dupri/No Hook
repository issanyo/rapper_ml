I been drinking and finessing tryna get me a bag
I been running up the numbers and it’s making you mad
Got your hoe in the crib she calling me Dad
I’m on a mission to the money and I’m getting it quick
Drinking on this Hennie and it’s making me sick
Got your hoe in the crib she all on my dick

[JD]
Aye, yeah
Pull up in a foreign and you know I got that stick
Talk shit Ima let it bang why you tryna hang
You ain't with the gang
Me and you we are not the same
Tryna diss me but you a lame
Yea diamonds make it sunny
Why you acting funny
Calling me a dummy
But I’m making money

[Scoonch]
If a homie hating call him arty bangs
Why you tryna hang yea you a lame
Go play d and d before you catch this flame
I been balling out yea like I’m dame
Bald head ass shining like the diamonds on my wrist
If he actin up I might take his bitch
Countin’ up these bands blue like stitch
