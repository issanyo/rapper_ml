(Intro: Daddy Mac)
Party people! Hah, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get out your seats, and let's get in!
That's right y'all, we're not just rough, (rough!) we're more than tough, (tough!)
And when it comes to rhymes? Ha ha, yuh, yuh, yuh

(Verse 1: Daddy Mac)
It's like this y'all, (This y'all!)
That y'all, (That y'all!)
I'm called the Daddy Mac and I'm back y'all, (Back y'all!)
Bustin' routines like them niggas in the '80s
Krossed out, no doubt, getting all the ladies
Pulsate, (Dominate!) up above!
Chillin' and I'm willin' gettin' nothin' but love!

(Mac Daddy)
Creatin' devastatin' in da place to be
It's the nigga that them niggas call the M-A-C!
Big makin', never fakin' chillin' all of the time!
Cold playin', rhyme's sayin', and I gets mine!

(Daddy Mac)
I spit (Rap!) not (Crap!), I do not sing
You wanna show? Lemme know, just give us a ring
It's like that y'all, (That y'all) I'm just keepin' it on
Mac Daddy, my man, 'til the break of dawn rock! (Rock!)

(Mac Daddy)
I never hesitate to call ya (Whack!) if ya (Whack!)
Put a gat on your (Back!), for talking all that smack!

(Hook)
And it don't stop and it don't quit
And it don't stop and it don't quit
And it don't stop and it don't quit
Servin' all them little fools for the 9 Trey like this!
And it don't stop and it don't quit
And it don't stop and it don't quit
And it don't stop and it don't quit
Servin' all them little fools for the 9 Trey like this!

(Verse 2: Mac Daddy)
Take a, take a, take a stand, my man, and I won't see
'cause I'm the real deal like Coke is it
And you won't find my name in the yellow page
'cause the Mac always speaks when he's on the stage
It's just two Emcees and one DJ
We get at least 50 G's, when we play
So Daddy Mac, my man, my mellow my ace why don't ya
Get on the mic and go rock the place!

(Daddy Mac)
My rock is hard, (Hard!)
You can't pull my card, (Card!)
I'm a shining star, (Star!)
Shining near and far, (Far!)
Shining like the sun, shooting like a gun
(Boyega, Boyega!) So ya niggas better run

(Mac Daddy & Daddy Mac together)
'cause these Emcees and Emcees that play
We rock shock the mic all night and day!

(Daddy Mac)
So jump back, and feel the wrath of a bomb
Here it comes, here it comes, here it Diddy Dum comes!

(Hook)
And it don't stop and it don't quit
And it don't stop and it don't quit
And it don't stop and it don't quit
Servin' all them little fools for the 9 Trey like this!
And it don't stop and it don't quit
And it don't stop and it don't quit
And it don't stop and it don't quit
Servin' all them little fools for the 9 Trey like this!

(Outro: Mac Daddy)
Word up, Kris Kross bring it down for the 9 Trey
Giving the proper dudes to them niggas in the old school
So you better believe that, peace
