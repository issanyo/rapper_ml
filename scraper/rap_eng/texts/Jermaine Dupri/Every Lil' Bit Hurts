[Intro]
Yes, it's love, so much love
You are the one

[Verse 1]
I can admit that I was wrong
Took you for granted now I'm all alone
It was so silly, all the things we said
All the words of pain runnin' through my head
If I had the chance I'd let you know
I'll tell you that I never want you to go
These tears I cry won't let me rest
'Til you return

[Chorus]
There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you
There's not one day that goes by
That I'm not singing the blues
There's not one day that goes by
That I don't wish it could work
And it's tearing me up inside
Every little bit hurts

It hurts; oh baby, you know you hurt me

[Verse 2]
I can't believe that you would leave me
I always thought you would stand by me
The thought of you in another arms
Is very slowly tearing me apart
What can I do to make you see?
Everything you need is here with me
I really miss the things that we used to do
And don't you miss the way I used to love you?

[Chorus]
There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you
There's not one day that goes by
That I'm not singing the blues
There's not one day that goes by
That I don't wish it could work
And it's tearing me up inside
Every little bit hurts

[Bridge]
You used to kiss me
You used to hold me
You used to love me
You used to touch me
All night long, you made everything alright
But now you're gone and I'm all alone
Things have stayed the same
And all I'm really trying to say, I'm the one to blame

[Chorus]
There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you
There's not one day that goes by
That I'm not singing the blues
There's not one day that goes by
That I don't wish it could work
And it's tearing me up inside
Every little bit hurts
