[Intro: Jermaine Dupri & Amil & Tamar]
Turn it up
Uh
Oh
Uh uh, no no
Get none
Ju-just 'cause you tricked a little doe tonight
Ow
That don't mean that you taking me home tonight
Hey, hey hey
Uh
No no
Oh oh
No no no no no
Uh uh
Ju-just 'cause you tricked a little doe tonight
Ow
That don't mean that you taking me home tonight
Uh, what

[Verse 1]
Mister first-class baller (ooh)
I got a few things to say to you (ok)
Right now you're getting on my nerves
With your trickin' bad habit issues (mm-hmm)
I'm sure if I was with you
No doubt I would be laced up
But I got a term paper due
Don't get it confused
My mind is on other things not you

[Chorus]
You can go home
Run your phone bill up
Run your cell phone up
You don't get none
You can page me all you want
But I won't call back, oh no
You won't get none
You can buy me diamonds
Nice trips on the beach
But you still don't get none
Trying to use cash
To get you some ass
Face the facts
Nigga, you ain't gonna get none

[Verse 2]
I ain't a part-time lover
There's a couple things I just don't do
Won't be no hoe, just drop my clothes
All those silly things that you're used to
So if you're stepping
Then approach me like a lady
Or there is no me at all
I take my time, won't cross the line
Until I really know

[Bridge]
I've seen you're type before
You think you've got so much game
Money is everything
And that's all I need to be happy
Soon you're gonna see
That's not how it should be
Until that day boy get nothing

[Rap]
JD:
Okay, if it's going like that
Let it go like this
Why you all up in the corner wit me drinking my Cris?
Straight laughing, talking, leading me on

Amil:
Huh, no that was your ass reading me wrong

JD:
Feel mine, come on
You act like I am the broke type
Can't be serious

Amil:
What
You acting like I'm the hoe type
Just cause you tricked a little doe tonight
That don't mean you taking me home tonight

JD:
Shit, is that right?

Amil:
That's right, get your rap tight
Press your brakes, put off your back lights

JD:
What you sayin'?
I'm playin', and I ain't gon' get get it?
Huh, I'm the man, girl
Look how quick I got your digits

Amil:
Oh, that's just my pace

JD:
I know that, but I'm saying...

Amil:
Well, if you know that
'Chu know I ain't gotta call you back
Poppin' Cris all night like I'ma fall for that
You need more than that to pull a ballers act

JD:
Turn it up, uh-huh

[Chorus]
You can go home
Run your phone bill up
Run your cell phone up
You don't get none
You can page me all you want
But I won't call back, oh no
You won't get none
You can buy me diamonds
Nice trips on the beach
But you still don't get none
Trying to use cash
To get you some ass
Face the facts
Nigga, you ain't gonna get none

[Chorus]
You can go home
Run your phone bill up
Run your cell phone up
You don't get none
You can page me all you want
But I won't call back, oh no
You won't get none
You can buy me diamonds
Nice trips on the beach
But you still don't get none
Trying to use cash
To get you some ass
Face the facts
Nigga, you ain't gonna get none

[Chorus]
You can go home
Run your phone bill up
Run your cell phone up
You don't get none
You can page me all you want
But I won't call back, oh no
You won't get none
You can buy me diamonds
Nice trips on the beach
But you still don't get none
Trying to use cash
To get you some ass
Face the facts
Nigga, you ain't gonna get none

[Chorus]
You can go home
Run your phone bill up
Run your cell phone up
You don't get none
You can page me all you want
But I won't call back, oh no
You won't get none
You can buy me diamonds
Nice trips on the beach
But you still don't get none
Trying to use cash
To get you some ass
Face the facts
Nigga, you ain't gonna get none
