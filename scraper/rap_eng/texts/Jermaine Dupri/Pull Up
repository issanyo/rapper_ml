[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign & Jermaine Dupri]
First off, he weak
Yeah
Cut him off, fuck with me
Good weed, long beach

Just tell me you need that, I pull up
You need some love, love some
Stay with him, or leave with me
I see you caught up in something that you don’t really want to be in

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
You say immature, but this the cure
On top of all that, she the sexiest one
Every time I see you out, you ain’t looking at me
Your eyes tell me that you wish it was good
You say you want it, he can’t afford it
He working on it, what the fuck do that mean?
Anyway, at the end of the day
You just caught up in something that you don’t really want to be in

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & Migos]
You say your nigga ain’t loving you right

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign & Jermaine Dupri]
All of these girls at my table
Yo yall know, yeah
I got Ciroq, Cris, and cocktails at my table
Migos, Dolla, JD, turn up
I see you looking over here at my table
Cause a nigga that do it ain’t able
Do it like this shawty
Go

[Verse 3: Quavo]
You know goddamn well that nigga you with ain’t shit
I didn’t mean to flex on him, but he ain’t got it like this
I know she want to ride in my foreign whips
When we fly out to Japan, your mom can’t go this year

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Your nigga not loving you right, you know that ain’t right
That’s why you crying at night
I could change your life (put you on ice)
Nice Bugatti do something I like
Can’t make you my wife
Cause I heard you be stripping at night
And that ain’t my type
You want to thug, I’ll show you some love
I want you to take them trips to meet the plug

[Verse 5: Offset]
Your nigga retire, your bitches got hired
I'm living my life like The Wire
She looking at me, she admire
The pussy singing like American Idol
My diamond pissing, Imma need me a diaper
She love when I pick her up in a new Spyder
She won’t get a wedding ring, treat her to better things
Alexander McQueen

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & Migos]
You say your nigga ain’t loving you right
Girl you need a thug in your life
You say your nigga ain’t loving you right
Girl you need a thug in your life
Somebody that’ll pull up
Somebody that’ll pull up and beat it down
