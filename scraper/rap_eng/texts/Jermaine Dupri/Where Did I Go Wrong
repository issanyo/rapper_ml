Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[LSG]
1 - 	I remember when
	You gave a damn about me
	And how I made you so happy
	And now I wish that things could go
	Back the way they used to be, girl
	Tell me where did I go wrong
	Do you have a answer for me, baby?
	Where did I go wrong
	Cuz you're driving me crazy, crazy, crazy

Everything was cool yesterday
Until you told me you had to get away
Away, no explaination
You must be in a situation somewhere else
Gotta be
'Bout the only way you can leave me by myself

Repeat 1

Was it something your girlfriend
Said I did?
Or was it just a misconception
Of the life I live
Did I party too much for you, girl?
Tell me what I gotta do
Cuz never in my wildest dreams
Did I think you would leave

Repeat 1

All I wanted to do
Was be a man to you
I worked so hard
To keep us together
Whatever it was
That makes you wanna leave
Baby, I'm sorry, I wish you would tell me
Where did I go wrong?

Repeat JD

Repeat 1 until fade
