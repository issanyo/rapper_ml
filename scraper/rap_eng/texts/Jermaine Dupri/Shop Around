[Intro: Michael Bivins & (Ronnie DeVoe)]
Yo, Ron, man...
(What's up, man?)
Man, I just got off the phone with my girl, right?
(Oh, yeah?)
And all she could think about was, you know, what we be doin' out here, you know what I'm sayin'? Like we be just with girls all the time
(Ah, same ol' same)
Yeah, I be tryna tell her, you know, it's all about you girl, no lie

[Verse 1: Johnny Gill]
I never move too fast girl
When it comes to letting my feelings show
I like to take my time out
I like to do it slow
'Cause a man's got to do
Every woman he can
'Cause it's in our nature
Said it's in my nature

[Chorus 2X]
First come first served is the way
Some do it but not me
I, shop around, shop, shop around

[Verse 2]
[Ralph Tresvant]
I've got expectations what my settle down should be
She got to be stacked head to toe
She's gotta be down for me
[Ricky Bell]
And I won't settle for nothing less
But the cream of the crop
Girl, I gotta have the best
[Johhny]
Don't let, don't let, I won't let you sell that game
'Cause I know what I want, and you know what you gotta bring
[Bobby Brown]
You don't have to tell me
About the things that's going on
I know how to pick and choose, win or lose
I know a good thing when it's going on

[Chorus]

[Ronnie DeVoe]
So what'cha gon' do
Say ya wanna get down, ah
So what'cha gon' do
Say ya wanna get down

[Chorus]

[Outro: Johnny]
She's gotta be stacked head to toe
She's gotta go for what she knows
'Cause that's the kinda girl that I need
Stacked head to toe
She's gotta go for what she knows
'Cause that's the kinda girl that I need
