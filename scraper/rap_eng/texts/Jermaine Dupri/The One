[Intro: Jermaine Durpi]
Yo, if you ever been in a relationship
And got hurt really, really bad
This song's for you
I mean, you know what it feel like
(Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talking' about)
To not ever wanna do it again
Then you meet somebody
Without a doubt you know they the one
Huh, yeah, but you be so scared and nervous
That you don't wanna get hurt again
(Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talking' about)

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
See, I'm going through a situation that I can't help
Wanna get a little closer, but I promised myself
That I would never give my heart away again, babe
I know it's hard but ya gotta understand it
The truth is all the hurt and the pain
And the shit that you get when you have it ain't worth it
I've been there so many times
I should know better, but I can't stop what I feel
When you're next to me, I really think I

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jermaine Dupri)]
Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared, and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
(Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)
Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared, and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey & (Jermaine Dupri)]
See the problem with relationships
In general is that it's always a game
In the beginning they'll do anything to have you
And once they do it's never the same
And I know everyone out there can relate
(Yeah, you know they can)
So the question is:
One: Do I really wanna trust this feeling?
Two: Do I wanna let it pass me by?
Three: Do you think it's only superficial?
Four: Could it actually be different this time?
Someone to love me
Someone to be my everything
Maybe I've stumbled upon

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jermaine Dupri)]
Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared, and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
(Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)
Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared, and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
(Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)
Oh, baby, sweet darling

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jermaine Dupri)]
(Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)
I, I think I finally found
Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared, and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
(Now MC baby tell 'em what we talkin' about)
Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared, and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
(Now MC baby tell 'em what we talkin' about)
