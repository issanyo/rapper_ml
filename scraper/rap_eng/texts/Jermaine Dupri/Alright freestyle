Well it feels so good livin in a big house
With a big check book and bank account
I said to myself how ya feelin Kris Kross
(Kris Kross – Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac
See,) you gotta look fresh and stay healthy
And you must eat your pork and fried green beans
I’m goin to the store and getting some eggs
I hope I don’t fall and break my legs
If I fall down and break my legs
I won’t have no way to shave my legs
(Kris Kross – I says I am what I am that’s who I be)
I be the rocket to the fire of the Twin Towers

Makin that dough like Charlie Sheen

(Kriss Kross – Yes) I am the ruler of Creed
Now I’m the ruler of all my dreams
I go so hard and ball till I fall
Makin that dough and freezing in the cold
I told my co-workers that I’m wild and

We ain't got no time to go on the road
