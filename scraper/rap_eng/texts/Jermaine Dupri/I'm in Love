[Verse 1: Brandon Hines]
Girl, it's driving me insane
Should I stay? Should I go?
It's confusing me
From your head to your toes
You're so sexy, baby
What should I do?
Girl, you're making it hard for me
'Cause you know all the ways to seduce me
I ain't in love without anything more
Don't wanna leave you alone

[Chorus: Brandon Hines]
When I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, so in love
See, I ain't gotta go, even though you begging me to stay
My baby at home got me feeling this way
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, so in love
See, I ain't gotta go, even though you begging me to stay
My baby at home got me feeling this way

[Verse 2: Brandon Hines]
We had our time, but I'm ending it now
Can't go on if my heart isn't in it
Can't go on if my heart isn't in it, baby
So we're finished
What should I do?
Girl, it's not like I'm blaming you now
'Cause I knew this from the beginning
Wait a minute
Then she said, "You can't just pick up and walk out the door Talking like you don't want this anymore"
This is goodbye I'm through with it, baby
And I'll tell you why
Girl, 'cause...

[Chorus: Brandon Hines]
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, so in love
See, I ain't gotta go, even though you begging me to stay
My baby at home got me feeling this way
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, so in love
See, I ain't gotta go, even though you begging me to stay
My baby at home got me feeling this way

[Bridge: Brandon Hines, Jermaine Dupri & Both]
I don't even know why I came, I don't even know why I'm here
I don't even know why I came, I don't even know why I'm here
I don't even know why I came, I don't even know why I'm here
I don't even know why I came, I don't even know why I'm here
Baby, I finally see
I know exactly where I should be
My heart won't let me through
Girl, all I want is you
The way that I will stay
Keep seeing images of your face
Girl, all I wanna do
Hurry back home to you

[Chorus: Brandon Hines]
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, so in love
See, I ain't gotta go, even though you begging me to stay
My baby at home got me feeling this way
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, so in love
See, I ain't gotta go, even though you begging me to stay
My baby at home got me feeling this way

[Bridge 2: Brandon Hines, Jermaine Dupri & Both]
It's my fault
(I don't even know why I came, I don't even know why I'm here)
I don't even know why I put myself in this situation
(I don't even know why I came, I don't even know why I'm here
I don't even know why I came, I don't even know why I'm here)
I don't even know why I came, I don't even know why I'm here

[Chorus: Brandon Hines]
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, so in love
See, I ain't gotta go, even though you begging me to stay
My baby at home got me feeling this way
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, so in love...
