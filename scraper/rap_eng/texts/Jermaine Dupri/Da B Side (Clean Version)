[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
B Side, B side, ha ha...
Check it...
So So Def...
Bad Boy...
Collaboration... (Listen to the B side)
The Notorious B.I.G. in the house...
We got Da Brat in the house... (Listen to the B side)
And me, ha...
Y'all know who I be...
Check it (Check it...)

[JD]
I got beats and beats that you love to ride to
Funk for your trunk is what, I provide you
So slide through your hood with me in your deck, cause your
Correct way to get your groove on
Flossed
And I paid the costs, to be the boss as a kid
Now I be the one that you can't mess with
They thought luck did it, but it didn't cause I'm back again
Back with the B.I.G. and my new found friend

[Brat]
Slidin' in from the front, never way behind
You tryin' to figure how I came with this style of mine, remain
In your seats as I release the clip
Into your hip
Brat and Biggie Smalls

[B.I.G.]
Aw shit
On top of all that, I'm So, So
Remarkable flow, making competition know
Ain't an MC coming close to The
Notorious B.I.G., baby baby (Oh)

[Chorus: Manuel Seal]
Lay all night (Night...) (Listen to the B side)
Everybody just, Lay all night (Night...) (listen to the B side)

[B.I.G.]
I never knew that you never had a clue
On who was the king of the street
Four deep in a Range Rover jeep
Guns under the seat
And my man just came home from work, release
Cristal in my lap, chronic in the air

[Brat]
Now Biggie pass what's lit like you just don't care

[B.I.G.]
Yeah, you're on my hit list, Biggie burns spliffs
When I'm pissed, release the Rolex from your wrist, baby
No human being, Korean or European
Be seein', what Big be seein', I leave 'em peein'
In they drawers, because Biggie Smalls
Is far from weak
Brat-tat-tat, please speak

[Brat]
Just close your eyes, cause you already see (Who)
The Notorious B.R.A.T

[B.I.G.]
The raw combination, destination
Number one tote a gun with no hestiation
Live with the Funkdafied cutie pie
Gat by the thigh, the Smalls by her side
If you mess with her, you got to mess with me
And we'll be rapping at your eulogy, baby (So)

[Chorus]
Lay all night (Night...) ( as Listen to the B side)
Uh ay ay, Lay all night (Night...) (listen to the B side)
Ha ha

[Jermaine Dupri]
Brat-tat-tat-tat, please speak

[Da Brat]
I got the
Funk in my pocket, keep it locked down
The soldier you know who represent them, platinum sounds
Now baby Biggie, I done heard that Juicy
Didn't find nothin' but truth
In the hook be a pledging to wreck
With a notorious hustler Ready To Die, I
Jump in the Benz, took me a little ride
Round the mountain, broke a left, hit, So So Def
And told the homey JD I was the one above the rest, we
Funkdafied, kicking it live
Robin Leach teachin' me, how to really survive
Whether it be, track or blunt, ain't no need to front
Got what you need, and I take everything you ever wanted
Knucka
We comin' mass, his pimpin' ass
His glass is full of Moet, the Rolex is
Bar-bayed, parkade
B to the R-A-T
Rolling off swoll' on chrome seventeen

[Chorus]
Lay all night (Night...) (Listen to the B side)
Uh uh give it what you want give it what you want, Lay all night (Night...) (listen to the B side)

[Outro: Jermaine Dupri]
Oh yeah haha uh uh uh
Lay back
Listen to the B-Side
Slide, glide, do whatever you want
Get out your lighters, huh
We be the rhyme writers
Starters
Hardest
From the heart of College Park, New York
Chicago
Wherever you wanna go
