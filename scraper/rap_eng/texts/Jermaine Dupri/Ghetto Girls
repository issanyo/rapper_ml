[Verse 1]
Uh, like when Janet was Justice, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
A shorty that can tell you when the J's come out
Get creative with they haircuts like T-boz
Fav'rite rappers is Bow Wow, Snoop, JD, & Nas
Always up in they somebody's face tryin' to fuss
And to get where she goin', she can take the bus
Like when Jada was Peaches in the movie Shame
Or the type you can find sitting at a Ruckers game
Only like dealing with cats that love to floss
Only like rocking the stuff that really costs
Lip gloss shinnis' tattoos on her back
Attitude like Mary J., mixed with Brat
You can find a man at a beauty shop, mall, or church
Name brand head to toe with the matching purse
So all that siddity stuff, y'all can keep
'Cause only girls that keep it ghetto get to ride with me (fo' sho)

[Chorus]
Ghetto girls that like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball with the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-Aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like, so tell me, baby, is that you?

[Verse 2]
When they ride with they man like you won't believe
Switch the color on there hair like Eve
When they talk like I talk but walk like a lady
Snap like I snap and get a little crazy
I love that especially when they bout the cheese
Type that won't front for some Mickey D's
Bandanas to barrets daisy dukes to spandex all thats good with me
I like em' G-H-E-T-T-O, now believe me she gots to go
At the corner store buying up all the sweets
From Choo Choo's to Rice Krispy Treats on my street
That's all I see like everyday
And they do what they do in a crazy way
Hang with the ballers so they never pay
And they usually got a name that's hard to say (ya heard)

[Chorus]
Ghetto girls that like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball with the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-Aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like, so tell me, baby, is that you?

[Bridge]
Let's talk about it now
If ya know what I mean
Shawty let yourself be seen (ya heard)
Let's talk about it now
If ya know what I mean
Shawty let yourself be seen
Uh, uh

[Chorus]
Ghetto girls that like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball with the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-Aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like, so tell me, baby, is that you?
