In the big chair wit the big hat screamin' "Y'all wanna floss wit us?"

Whole street team tryin' do what I do

We be the best harlem niggas 80's to lately
Think of Po Wop, Mickey Bonz and A-Z
Fresh Ritz Zit, Kevin Giles and DB
And at the end of all tha shit niggas still say me
I'm the best that ever did it, got a way wit it
Put grannie on the stand, she'll never say who did it
I'm from where, even the gangsta's live to
Make a mil. on the stoop, every summer switch boots
Cats change they name, to Phil like a giant
I treat rap like packs, role dills on consignment
This is for cats hummin' crack, bitchin' and parkin'
All the grimie niggas who got generous hearts
Got a brother doin' life, to see him is hard
F*ckin' wit mase, is like a nigga swimmin' wit sharks
My niggas chase cake, play some infa-reds
Some niggas in the state, some is in the feds
Spit shit at niggas that might erase they head
And role miserable niggas who can't wait to be dead
