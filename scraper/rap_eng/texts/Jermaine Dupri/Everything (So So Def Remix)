So So Def come on
Uh, say what?
Y'all know what it is!
Mary come on

[Mary](JD)
It's all because of you (uh-huh)
I'm never sad and blue (uh-huh)
You brighten up my day
In your own special way
Whenever you're around (uh)
I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend
On you I can depend, take me

[Mary]
You take me away
And you bring me paradise
And when I have cloudy days
You bring some sunshine in my life, oh

[Mary]
You are everything and everything is you
Oh you are everything and everything is you

[JD]
Now when you hear something fresh it's me
All throughout the East and the West it's me
Chi-Chi-O, the new flows, the new clothes
Smoking Maganudos, shopping new hoes, you know
Keep me a buzz from the Cristal fluid
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I do it
Its tha don what, with the reputation
For making everybody dance till the sun come up

[ROC]
We going all the way to the top
Mary Blige and ROC
The Queen of R&B, the King of Hip-Hop
So stop, y'all ain't no match for us
Never drop gold, everything platinum plus
Now throw your hands in the air
Get close to honey there
The ladies had their night
But fellas it's our year to do our thang
Make girls scream and get the cream
Now listen to Mary sing
Tell 'em I'm everything

[Mary]
My darling only you
Can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray
You'll never go away
I promise I will try
Until the day I die
To treat you like a king
'Cuz you are my everything

[Mary]
You take me away
And you bring me paradise
And when I have cloudy days
You bring some sunshine in my life, oh

[Mary](JD)
You are everything and everything is you
Oh you are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
Oh you are everything and everything is you
(Y'all know what it is)
You are everything and everything is you
(Mary J, So So Def)
Oh you are everything and everything is you
(All day, every day, now what y'all wanna do?)
You are everything and everything is you
(What y'all wanna do, huh? Huh, what y'all wanna do, huh?)
Oh you are everything and everything is you
(Huh, y'all know what it is, tell me, come on)

[JD]

What y'all wanna do, huh? (Yeah, yeah)
