One, one-one, two, three

[Jermaine Dupri]
So So Def, uh huh uh, rock on now
Huh, rock on now, come on now, rock on now
Uh huh, come on now, uh huh uh, Maxwell
Uh huh, rock on now, come on now, rock on now
Come on now, uh rock on now, come on now, uh bounce, bounce
Talk to me

[Maxwell]
I was reborn when I was broken (Uh huh uh)
I wouldn't believe, I wouldn't believe, no (No)
Been through a storm, no use in hoping
That you would come rescue me
Somehow your love set me free (Uh huh)
And I...(I)

[Chorus]
I can let my life pass me by
Or I can get down and try (Uh huh and try)
Work it all out this lifetime
Work it on out this time
I can let it all pass me by
Or I can get down and try (Uh huh, yeah)
Work it all out this lifetime, lifetime (look at this)

[Maxwell]
There was a time when love wasn't chosen (Uh huh, yo I like that)
Now I'm just open for more
Now I'm just reaching out for something better
That I had before, girl (Uh uh)
There ain't a bottom line in your world
Ooh and I...(I)

[Chorus]
I can let my life pass me by
Or I can get down and try (Try)
Work it all out this lifetime
Work it on out this time (Uh huh uh)

[Maxwell]
I can let it all pass me by
Or I can just try and try (This part I like)
I can move to the light
Oh, if I take it one day at a time
Oh, spread my love out and fly  (Uh uh)
Oh I, can move to the light
Ooh I can just make you understand
That love is not a fairy tale in a melody (Yeah)
If you want it you can have it girl
Maybe you will see, maybe you will see (Come on))

[Jermaine Dupri]
Yeah, that's where ya open ya arms
And just grab somebody, know what I mean (Oh, oh)
Yeah, know what I'm sayin' (Lifetime)
All I do is make em' dance, you know that
Ha, whether it's fast or slow
You know how it go, Maxwell, So So
Ha, talk to me, I
