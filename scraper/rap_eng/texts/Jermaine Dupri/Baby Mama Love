[JD] Wassup!!

[Verse - Jermaine Dupri]
I don't why but I keep going back (back)
Knowing damn well that I shouldn't be doing that
Cause I ain't doing nothing but making it worse for me
And I ain't doing nothing but making her thirst for me
But this thing here, I can't shake man
Hard motherfucking habit to break man
We fuss, we fight, then I spend the night
I know it ain't right.. that's what it is!

[Chorus - N2U]
Baby mama love!!
See I'll be damned
If I let my son call another man daddy
And if you feel like I feel that's
Baby mama love!!
I don't wanna be with her
But I just can't stand to see her with nobody else
I know it's bad, but I can't help myself
Baby mama love!!
See I'll be damned
If I let my son call another man daddy
And if you feel like I feel that's
Baby mama love!!
I don't wanna be with her
But I just can't stand to see her with nobody else
I know it's bad, but I can't help myself
Baby mama love!!

[Verse - N2U]
Went to the crib, did what we did till about six in the morning
Wasn't thinking bout having no kids
Just thinking bout getting it on and
On and on, and on and on and onnnn
That's how I got where I'm at right now
Let me take it back right now
She was there for me, everytime I needed
Even when I got a little lonely
Wasn't even like she was my girl
She was more like my little homie
It's deeper deeper than you'll ever know!
Sometimes you lose control
The hardest thing to get up out ya system is that

[Chorus]

[Verse - N2U]
Oh Lord it's getting crucial!
And being truthful I don't understand it
I just won't have it!
Her out wit another nigga in the bar
My son wit another nigga in the car
Girl you ain't gon play me
Like I'm just gon be tolerating this man
Playing dad, see I pay the bills
I'll tap the phone, I catch ya here again
Homie we gon have a problem
Let it be known, I might not stay here
But this is my home, leave it alone!
Cause this child is my baby
No if, and, but's or maybe's
Girl you gon drive me crazy!
With this..

[Chorus]
