[Verse 1]
What more can I say 'bout you? Boy, you're so hot
Ooh, yeah, baby, I ain't ever
Felt that there, boy, don't you stop, you found my spot
'Cause you know I likes it when you do it mo' better
Like when you say to me
Aww, Jan your body feels like none I've ever felt
You know it makes the you-know-what come out
Oh, I know you're with it, come and get it 'cause you know it

[Chorus]
It's true, it's you, it's something that you do
Ain't nobody else been able to get it out me, get it out me
It's you, it's something that you do
Ain't nobody else been able to get it out me, get it out me
What it is I do not know
But you make me wanna let it go

[Verse 2]
Let me break it down one time, hope you don't mind
But I really wanna try something that you might think is
Taboo but you will be more than satisfied
Boy, I'm getting wild now, watch me go way out
Into another place, into another space
We can make this as creative as you like
Feel free to express yourself
Oh, I'm gonna get it, love it, take it 'til there's nothing left

[Chorus]
It's true, it's you, it's something that you do
Ain't nobody else been able to get it out me, get it out me
It's you, it's something that you do
Ain't nobody else been able to get it out me, get it out me

[Bridge]
Ain't too many people that can get it out of me
Something about your swagger and the way you talk to me
Ain't too many people that can get it out of me
Something about your swagger and the way you talk to me

Break it down now
Break it down now
Break it down now

[Chorus]
It's true, it's you, it's something that you do
Ain't nobody else been able to get it out me, get it out me
It's you, it's something that you do
Ain't nobody else been able to, get it out me, get it out me
What it is I do not know
But you make me wanna let it go
