Every time I do it, you know just who I do it fo'
My O.G. niggas, my girls in the strip clubs
& for my top cats that's block cruisin'
That's fuck the cops serve the rocks on the block music
& any club, any party don't rock this

& fo' the projects buildings behind the locked gates
They do what they gotta do & hustle at a top rate
Movin' them O's makin' they pention, we grind 'til we ride sittin' on 24 inches

Shipped across the border from purp to the cola
I hustle spreewells like I'm 3 10 & molders
Pond shop niggas, that keep a couple handguns
Chopper in the trunk & they keep one in the head son

My motive is to kill a nigga shoot above the chest boy
