[Spoken Intro]
Folks will taking advantage of you because they believe you’re too weak to speak up for yourself
You don’t have to speak up for yourself
Be still and let God fight your battles
Somebody come and go with me, friend!

[Verse 1]
There will be mountains that I will have to climb
And there will be battles that I will have to fight
But victory or defeat, it's up to me to decide
But how can I expect to win if I never try?

[Chorus]
I just can't give up now
Come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me

[Verse 2]
Never said there wouldn't be trials
Never said I wouldn't fall
Never said that everything would go
The way I want it to go
But when my back is against the wall
And I feel all hope is gone
I'll just lift my head up to the sky
And say, “Help me to be strong”

[Chorus]
I just can't give up now
I've come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me

[Bridge]
No you didn't bring me out here to leave me lonely
Even when I can't see clearly
I know that you are with me, so I can’t

[Chorus - Variation]
Oh, I just can't give up now
Cause I've come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me (nobody told me that the road would be easy)
And I don't believe (don't believe)
He's brought me this far to leave me

And I can't give up now
Yeah, just can't, oh
Can't give up now
Said I've come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me (nobody told me that the road would be easy)
And I don't believe (don't believe)
He's brought me this far to leave me

I just can't give up now
I've come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy (it's been a little rough but I don't believe)
Don't believe, He's brought me this far to leave me (no no, no no)

I can't give up now!
I just can't give up now
Said I've come too far
Come too far from where I started from
No one said it would be easy
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe
He's brought me this far to leave me

[Outro]
I don't feel no ways tired
(Be still and let God fight your battles)
I don't believe He's brought me this far (x8)
