[Intro]
Why don't you listen to this recording with interest?

[Verse 1]
Boy, I can't wait to get you alone inside my house
'Cause baby it's you and only you that I keep on thinking about
I know what you want it, how good my love could be
Tonight you'll get the answers I'll satisfy your curiosity

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me away in ecstasy
I want to know how it feels to be loved
Boy, take your time because I have all night
I'm gonna show you what I'm been thinking of

[Chorus]
I got love on my mind
I knew it's the way to make things right
I think it's about that time
I got love on my mind
And I'm in the mood to be moved
And do all the things you want me to

[Verse 2]
I've been watching you and thinking to myself
You're looking so so def to me, and I'm feeling so sexy
You know I never felt this way before
I really can't help myself, 'cause I'm thinking of nothing else

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me away in ecstasy
I want to know how it feels to be loved
Boy, take your time because I have all night
I'm gonna show you what I'm been thinking of

[Chorus]
I got love on my mind
I knew it's the way to make things right
I think it's about that time
I got love on my mind
And I'm in the mood to be moved
And do all the things you want me to

[Break]
I got love on my mind
I knew it's the way to make things right
I think it's about that time
I got love on my mind
And I'm in the mood to be moved
And do all the things you want me to

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me away in ecstasy
I want to know how it feels to be loved
Boy, take your time because we have all night
I'm gonna show you what I've been thinking of

[Chorus]
I got love on my mind
I know it's the way to make things right
I think it's about that time
I got love on my mind
And I'm in the mood to be moved
And do all the things you want me to

I got love on my mind
I got love on my mind
