[Intro]
This time
This time
This

[Verse 1]
I made the mistake like before
Giving you the third degree, taking you through it
I told you I get what I want
And I ain't trying hear nothing else but just do it
And I had to take a good look
When everything else didn't have a ring to it
I'm sitting here blaming myself
When I saw what you were feeling inside, I misused it

[Pre-Hook]
This time it's all my fault (Ooh oh)
This time I can't let go
This time I did it
Really, but I got these feelings
How am I supposed to know? (Ooh oh)
Can't let my weakness show (Yeah yeah)
Having my fits may cause me to miss this first chance at real love

[Hook]
This time I won't let you get away from me
This time I'm gonna let you take it where it should be
This time I won't say no
'Cause saying no is a way to protect me
Baby this time (this time)
This time (this time)
This time (this time)
I'ma let you want me

[Verse 2]
Every female I know
Can't seem to take her eyes off of you and I see it
It's just that my girls been so hurt
And I'm not trying be the next one going through it
I see that I got something real
And I don't wanna lose it and gotta to say thank you
The thought of you gone gives me chills
So baby let's just put this aside and just come here

[Pre-Hook]
This time it's all my fault (Ooh oh)
This time I can't let go
This time I did it
Really, but I got these feelings
How am I supposed to know? (Ooh oh)
Can't let my weakness show (Yeah yeah)
Having my fits may cause me to miss this first chance at real love

[Hook]
This time I won't let you get away from me
This time I'm gonna let you take it where it should be
This time I won't say no
'Cause saying no is a way to protect me
Baby this time (this time)
This time (this time)
This time (this time)
I'ma let you want me

[Bridge]
Never will I deny you love me
All this time you stuck here and didn't leave (my time)
Now I know what "Trust me, you will see" was (And I owe you)
All my heart and deepest apologies
So let's take this back to we got it, man
I just wanna do this with you, boy

[Hook]
This time I won't let you get away from me
This time I'm gonna let you take it where it should be
This time I won't say no
'Cause saying no is a way to protect me
Baby this time (this time)
This time (this time)
This time (this time)
I'ma let you want me
This time I won't let you get away from me
This time I'm gonna let you take it where it should be
This time I won't say no
'Cause saying no is a way to protect me
Baby this time (this time)
This time (this time)
This time (this time)
I'ma let you want me
