I wanna see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh now
I wanna see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh now
Every time you leave, the thought is left in my head
That you've gotta go home to be with somebody else
Now even though I'm sick and tired of being alone
I still gotta ask myself if what I'm doing is wrong
And what about you, what about you?
Don't you think it's time, don't you think it's time
You tell her the truth?
Does she know where you go when you leave?
That you're always with me, and it's all about me
Does she know it won't be long before she's out the door?
I'm in, number one and it's all about me
Even if I wanted I can't leave you right now
'Cause all is fair in love and war and I like how we get down
Although I'm in love with what's going on
But I still gotta ask myself if what I'm doing is wrong
You can't tell me she ain't seeing the change
She ain't feeling no pain
And she don't wanna know my name
Does she know where you go when you leave?
That you're always with me, and it's all about me
Does she know it won't be long before she's out the door?
I'm in, number one and it's all about me
