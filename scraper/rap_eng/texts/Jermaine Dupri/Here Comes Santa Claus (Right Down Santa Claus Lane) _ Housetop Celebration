[Chorus 1]
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Bridge]
Ho ho ho
Who wouldn't go
Ho ho ho
Who wouldn't go
Up on a house top
Click click click
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Verse]
So gather 'round
Gather 'round
Until night becomes the day
Gather 'round, gather 'round
We're gonna have a good time and celebrate

[Verse]
So gather 'round
Gather 'round
Until night becomes the day
Gather 'round, gather 'round
We're gonna have a good time and celebrate

[Bridge]
Ho ho ho
Who wouldn't go
Ho ho ho
Who wouldn't go
Up on a house top
Click click click
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Chorus 2]
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus is coming tonight

[Outro]
Santa Claus is coming tonight
Santa Claus is coming tonight
Santa Claus is coming tonight
