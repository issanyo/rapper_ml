[Chorus]
Aaah, you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spinnin' like a ferris wheel
Aaah, you turn me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby your love is surreal

[Post-Chorus]
You make me go, you make go, you make me go
Make me go
You make me go, you make me go, you make me go
Like a rollercoaster

[Verse 1]
There's a high level of love goin on
The fellins are just way too strong
The reason that you got me gone
Is baby cause you turn me on
With a bit of it more than a little bit
I addicted every time get a hit os it
Cause oh baby you take me so high
When i'm on your rollercoaster ride

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in and out of love
And it's all because
I can't make up my mind
I'm so confused
Don't know what to do
And it's cause of you

[Chorus]
Aaah, you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spinnin' like a ferris wheel
Aaah, you turn me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby your love is surreal

[Post-Chorus]
You make me go, you make go, you make me go
Make me go
You make me go, you make me go, you make me go
Like a rollercoaster

[Verse 2]
Boy you give me butterflies
So deep inside
Breaks me down when I look in those eyes
Takes me out way across the sky
Baby boy, I won't lie
Usually I'm not this shy
You do it to me every time
I get on your rollercoaster ride

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in and out of love
And it's all because
I can't make up my mind
I'm so confused
Don't know what to do
And it's cause of you

[Chorus]
Aaah, you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spinnin' like a ferris wheel
Aaah, you turn me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby your love is surreal

[Post-Chorus]
You make me go, you make go, you make me go
Make me go
You make me go, you make me go, you make me go
Like a rollercoaster

[Spoken]
Wanna ride?

[Bridge]
'Cause you make me go up and down
And around and around and
I can't take it
You make me go up and down
And around and around
That's why boy I can't take it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in and out of love
And it's all because
I can't make up my mind
I'm so confused
Don't know what to do
And it's cause of you

[Chorus]
Aaah, you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spinnin' like a ferris wheel
Aaah, you turn me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby your love is surreal

Aaah, you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spinnin' like a ferris wheel
Aaah, you turn me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby your love is surreal

[Post-Chorus]
You make me go, you make go, you make me go
Make me go
You make me go, you make me go, you make me go
Like a rollercoaster
