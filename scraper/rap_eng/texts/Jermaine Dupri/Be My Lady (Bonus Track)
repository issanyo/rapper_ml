I can't wait 'til you get home
Just can't wait 'til you get home
I can just hear it, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody calling me (Be my lady)
I can just hear it
Somebody, somebody, somebody calling me (Be my lady)

[Lord Tariq]
Yo, I seen ya E-Class in through the block in your silver 320
No tint, flashing to the world you got a few pennies
With an S Class face and a slight beige complexion
Give me memories of me and you sexin'
So I stepped in, less than, a minute or so
I saw your eyes on my 6, yo, get in and we go
Her shit is good, yeah I know because I hit it before
But it's the walk that got me still feelin this hoe
I offered the world and ya still politely tellin me 'No'
You cut it short, said you didn't like me sellin that blow
I only do what I know, these streets raised me, pays me
With you in my life it's all gravy, maybe, a trip to the islands
Wildin' in the sun and you ask, why should I?
You be smilin' for one, huh
I gets the job done in more ways than one
Grow old and maybe raise a son, so, let me know, huh?

	What's it gonna take to get next to you?
	Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
	Show you ain't nothin' about me shady
	And I'd love it if you'd be my lady

	What's it gonna take to get next to you?
	Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
	Show you ain't nothin' about me shady
	And I'd love it if you'd be my lady

[Peter Gunz]
Shorty, I remember back when I seen you with your crew
And they was hatin', cock blockin' cuz they knew I wanted you
They would tell you that I dog girls and all that shit
And you was just another chick that I wanted to hit
And it was true, I ran through many, didn't love any
And the thug in me made me dog many
But now I see my playin' days is over
I'd like to take this time out to finally get to know ya
A lot of things I wanna show ya
You say you're not impressed with my money and fame
And it's crazy how you say I make my money in vain
Cuz I talk about guns and drugs, hoes and thugs
Don't ya know that your music shows no love?
But I rap what I see; for instance
Won't you cut the clown cat that ya seein' and come chat with me
We can sit in the six and make plans
And talk about the steps I gotta take
Honey, to be your man, c'mon

Repeat 1

	C'mon, babe
	C'mon, baby
	I said c'mon, girl
	Be my lady

	C'mon, babe
	C'mon, baby
	I said c'mon, girl
	Be my lady
