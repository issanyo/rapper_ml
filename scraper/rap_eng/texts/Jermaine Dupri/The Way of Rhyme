(Verse 1: Mac Daddy)
I'm the quicker gripper ripper
On a track like this
The miggity-mac never slacks
And I'm packing the gift
I've got more flavor than Life Savers
Every day I create
Some of the wiggity-slyest rhymes
That you ever heard from one
I ain't the type to be slept on
The type to be crept on
And those who think I am can step on
For every move you make
I got a trick
And my tracks got more kicks
Than a Bruce Lee flick
I like my pants to sag
Make you say
"Dag, uh! That little nigga is so bad."
The capital capital K's don't play, we amaze
And make you move & groove
In so many different ways
'Jump! Jump!' was the first episode
To put you in the mode
And let you know I flow

(Hook)
Like that y'all (that y'all)
Like that y'all (that y'all)
Like that-a-tha-that, a-like that y'all (that y'all)

(Verse 2: Daddy Mac)
Every everybody wants to know (what?!)
Where I get my get my funky funky flow (yo!)
Straight from the ghetto and I'm fierce like a dragon
Hat to the back and my pants keep saggin'
Here I go again movin' your adrenaline
Totally totally totally krossed out
Can you comprehend?

(Interlude)
Wait a minute, drop a old school beat
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

(Verse 3: Daddy Mac)
Tupa-tupa girl scooper, that's what I be
Girl-stoppin', ghetto-talkin', it's the mac daddy

(Bridge)
I got a flow
(You got a what?)
I got a flow
I got a flow
(You got a what?)
I got a flow

(Verse 4: Daddy Mac)
On the playground I say now
You won't see me swinging
Skin tight clothes
And you don't be singing
Daddy don't do dat. Dad do rap
So please don't get passed to the whack

(Bridge)
I got a flow
(You got a what?)
I got a flow
I got a flow
(You got a what?)
I got a flow
I got a flow
(You got a what?)
I got a flow
I got a flow
(You got a flow?)
So let it go
(Yeah)

(Verse 5: Mac Daddy)
Me bein' the mac means I'm all that
I could do this and that
And none of it ever comes out whack
And never have you ever seen
A MC this size this tough
You might have seen some kids
But they wasn't this rough
I'm the type you don't want to touch
Tangle or tamper with
Your rhymes are doo-doo
Like a two-day-old pampers, kid
So spark off and tie
Catch if I hit the do'
And take your wiggity-whack
Style to the sto'
