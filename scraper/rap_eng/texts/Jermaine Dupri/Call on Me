[Iintro: Nelly, Janet and JD]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, huh, huh, huh
C'mon, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing it for me (Uh-hu, uh-hu)
Yeah, oh, yeah (uh-hu, uh-hu, uh-hu)
Everybody come on (Uh-hu, uh-hu)
Yeah, yeah, yah (Y'all know what this is)
Let's go

[Verse 1: Janet]
I don't know, if I ever felt like this before (Uh uh)
But I'm sure, that the way I feel I don't want it to go
'Cause I cried my share of tears
And I sang my share of blues
But to keep you over here, I'll do what I got to do
So baby

[Chorus: Janet, Nelly & both]
Call on me, whether day or night
I'll never leave
See, you don't have to be alone
I'll come anywhere you want
Baby, just pick up the phone and call on me
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh you ain't know, I wanna be your homie, lover, girl
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Call on me, yeah, yeah)
See, there it go, see, there it go, mama
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Nelly]
See I, I have yet to meet a girl that could break me down
It's like I get caught in the middle
I get caught up a little anytime she's around
I be posted waitin on stand-by
Lookin' to catch that red-eye
Doin' whatever whenever, never forget I said I'd be
Here when you want to get what you need
If you wanna receive then, oh, please believe you could

[Chorus: Janet, Nelly & both]
Call on me, whether day or night
I'll never leave
See, you don't have to be alone
I'll come anywhere you want
Baby, just pick up the phone and call on me
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh you ain't know, I wanna be homie, lover, girl
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Call on me, yeah, yeah)
See, there it go, see, there it go, mama
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: Janet]
Call on me, when you need someone who cares
Say the words and I'll be there

Call on me, anytime that you please
Babe whatever you want, babe whatever you need
Because you're the one I love, baby, just

[Chorus: Janet, Nelly & both]
Call on me, whether day or night

[Outro: Nelly, Janet & both]
It don't matter where you go
I'll come anywhere you want me to
It don't matter near or far
It's like anything you say I'll do (uh uh)
And it don't matter where you go
I'll come anywhere you want me to (uh uh)
And it don't matter near or far
It's like anything you say I'll do
