[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
You make a brotha wanna faint (damn!)
Or put you on a plate, sock you up wit a mu'fuckin' biscuit
Maan, it was a house party ayyo I probably sound corny
I got oatmeal hormones ma, I'm instantly horny
I mean, the way you carry yourself
I mean, if I wasn't you I'd probably marry myself
I'm in ya eyes, did I say ya ass? I mean ya eyes
Face bangin' haven't even got to ya thighs
I mean the walk-to-walk is like the Matrix
I could sit a drink on that ass if I had nowhere to place it
Face it, how could anybody dislike you?
These others girl are cool, but not quite like you
I mean, ayyo I focus on my pass a lot
But relationships like "Twister", gotta hold ya spot
I mean, and you know that my time is skimpy
If I'm the only in yo heart then it's probably empty
Girl..

Ohh Murphy, Murphy Leee
Ohh things ain't what they used to be, nooo
But ever since you hit the road
Yes I'm spent in this relationship
And I'm so in love that it makes me sick

Ohh Murphy, Murphy Leee
Ohh things ain't what they used to be, nooo
I can't spend this time alone
I tell ya without you
You'd make me stronger

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
You too fly to be askin' a guy why
All my life love kept on "passin' me by"
You can't change a woman by diamond chainin' her
Change don't make change, mathematically train her
It's a two way thing
Now Scott tell a Motorola by high chairs and baby strollers
I be the sun, you be the moon let the kids be the star
I know who you is, you know who I are
And when the do' close, you know I ain't goin' that far
You got keys to erry house, keys to erry car
And hell yeah, I need love too like LL
I must be on Neptune, cuz love is for real but still
You not from much and, so girl it ain't no rushin'
And respect how there be more talkin' than touchin'
Seein' you no frontin' is way better than nuttin'
And it means summin to me, if you want me speak on it
Girl..

Ohh Murphy, Murphy Leee

Ohh Murphy, Murphy Leee
Ohh things ain't what they used to be, nooo
I can't spend this time alone
I tell ya without you

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
You a housewife
The type of girl that always know what time it is
The tick-tock type, keep her own shoes tied, push her own riide
Quick to give me money when my bills too high
..I need top-notch sex
Wash dishes, and sweep, mop topless
Never give me stress, love when the God bless
Makin' love to the mime boo could be a mental mess
And you don't like me like shy but I'm a lover mon
Other the other hond, can't stand you wit another mon
I went from Timberlond's, tuxedo's, camabons
I got a fast, fast girl I don't wanna run
I can't help it I ain't ready
But see havin' a steady girl is a different world like Freddy
Love is deadly, in the shower singin' melodies
I'll make it up if ya let me girl..
