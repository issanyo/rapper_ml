Leave the way, I'll work my magic
Soon as I throw it up (it up)
Money disappear
Soon as I whipple up (pull up)
Will be outta here (skrr)
And Imma give you tip all night long
Deep in the way you drop it low then bring it up slow
Bring it up slow, bring it up slow

Bend over, touch your toes

Touch your toes
You got a body like a model (like a model)
You remind me of a model

Bring it up slow, bring it up slow

You got a body like a model
You remind me of a model

Bring it up slow, drop it low then bring it up slow
Bring it up slow, bring it up slow
Bring it up slow, bring it up slow
