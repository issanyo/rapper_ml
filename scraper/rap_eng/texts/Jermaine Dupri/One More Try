[Intro]
Baby

[Verse 1]
I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you donâ€™t, just let me go

[Chorus]
'cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

[Chorus]
And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
Oh, the last one I had
Made me cry
Oh so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
'cause it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
Who is that teacher?
I'm the student
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Boy I'm just gonna say goodbye
You are my teacher
You are my leader

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

[Chorus]
And teacher
There are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh, so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
'cause there ain't no joy
Just an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try

[Outro]
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try
