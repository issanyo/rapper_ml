(Intro: Mac Daddy)
When I do my thing I swing and you can't hang ah
Go up against the K's ya going out with a bang, ah
When I do my thing I swing and you can't hang ah
Go up against the K's ya going out with a bang, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

(Verse 1: Mac Daddy)
I'm the type hip hopper that's a show stopper
I break 'em off proper, unlike them other teeny poppers
That continue to say and say never, ever come my way
I'm waiting, yeah, I have a bad crew to make my day!
So watch and chop and top and drop 'em little punks quick
And teach 'em never to mess with this Krossed Out kid
But really though, you kill me you pretending, you one of them
Pissed off 'cause Kris Kross made 5 million people (Jump!)
You tryna floss with the toss but the Kross 'cause the Kross is boss
And everybody knows that house
I'm the dad, miggida-major, grab your pad bumpin'
Like a W-A the K's are always into somethin'
So your best bet is to bop your head, punk
And just listen to the way the K's Freak Da Funk!

(Daddy Mac)
Now my hat's to the back and my pants still saggin'
But y'all niggas can't fade me
So just scream on, (scream on), and just dream on, (dream on)
But I'll still be the D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C
It's known that it's on when the Daddy's supposed to let go
Some of the funk that you can bump in yo '64
I brought in some new styles, the double K's here again
So when you come in yo Dodge's back, this is how we comin' in!

(Hook)
When I do my thing I swing and you can't hang ah
Go up against the K's ya going out with a bang, ah
When I do my thing I swing and you can't hang ah
Go up against the K's ya going out with a bang, ah

(Verse 2: Daddy Mac)
I heard you wanna jump with the Macs, but you ain't a match nigga
'cause my mind is a nine and my tongue is a trigger
So ease back, off these in you C's with you B's black
Tryna front on the Macs, how you gon' that?

(Mac Daddy)
I love to rip it when it's rockin' 'cause I love it that way
Don't mess around with the best around, his name starts with a K
Ain't nothin' fake here dear, you gets nothin' but the real deal
Hummin' and comin' at ya like my homies from the hill

(Daddy Mac)
I'm rough (rough!), tough, (tough!)  and ready for the killin'
Crushin' up crews and sellin' nothin' but a million
With a, boogie, boogie, the bang, bang the boogie
To the beat, M-A-C, why don't ya speak for me

(Mac Daddy)
I'm strictly hip, hop, the hippie to the hippie
Strictly hip hop, the top is what I drop
If you know what's good for you homie, you will back up, or get ya smack up
From this Kris that they call the Miggida Mac, uh
'Cause when I break niggas up, I keep 'em broke down
I'm like the R-A-K-I-M, I ain't no joke clown
So ya best bet is to bop ya head punk
And just listen to the way the K's Freak Da Funk, uh

(Hook)
When I do my thing I swing and you can't hang ah
Go up against the K's ya going out with a bang, ah
When I do my thing I swing and you can't hang ah
Go up against the K's ya going out with a bang, ah

(Outro)
I'm da freaker, da one who freaks da funk! (x5)
