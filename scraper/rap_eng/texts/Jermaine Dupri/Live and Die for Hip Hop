1, 2, 1, 2, uh
Ah, 1, 2, 1, 2
Mic check 1, 2, 1, 2
1, 2, 1, 2, uh
1, 2, 1, 2
Mic check 1, 2, 1, 2

[Verse 1: Mack Daddy]
I devoted my whole life to rockin' mics gettin' crowds lifted
Put my pants on backwards 'cause I wanted to be different
I keeps 'em with a crease, timepiece Bertolucci
House full of honeys sportin' Gucci, cuttin' coochie
I'm the man, girlfriend, luxury I swim
Macadocious to the most, brown, sexy, slim
Setter of trends, known for making dividends
And millions of people jump, jump, jump, jump...

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
Now who choose to be the next nigga to step, get deleted by Def
Undefeated, ain't no thang to put that body to rest
Chest filled with smoke, yolkin' niggas up by the collar
Follow me 'cause my dollars makin' more sense than Common
Robbin' you for your money and your diamonds
Endangerin' your species
More Than A Woman like The Bee Gees
No remorse, steady smokin' plenty grass (let it go)
And let Da Brat commence to be the baddest hoe

[Chorus 2X: Mack Daddy & Da Brat]
Well, nigga, roll me a mic and let me smoke 'til I'm high
If you ever seen me rock then you know that I
Live and die for the things I do
Slang I use, breakin' down mics, and destroyin' crews

[Verse 3: Daddy Mack]
Yachts is by the sea, big party (twelve until)
See I'm the Daddy of the Mack and at the top of world
I chill, keep it real
My field of work consists of that
Thuggish ass niggas sayin', "Where they keep that pistol at?" (My life)
I wouldn't trade it, to me, it's nothin' better
Wakin' up when I wanna, sportin' Jay Boogie leather
Autographs, bubble baths, five-star hotels
Rollin' wit' a click super thick and everybody's gettin' mail

[Verse 4: Mr. Black]
Take off the safety and face me
Gun powder chowder for real
The last nigga figured to ever make it off the hill
But still rhymes rock like coke that smoke
And I'm in effect with a Tec that got a infrared scope
Smackin' those actin' tough as Tinactin
Fall up in yo' hood increase your brain with the Mac-10
Stack ends, seventeens on the Benz
And burner by my thigh in case these niggas wan' die

[Chorus: Daddy Mack & Mr. Black]

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
Oh ooh, something tells me
We got it goin' on, we're turnin' ya on
It's that So So Def...

[Verse 5: Jermaine Dupri]
I want you to feel me
My whole thang is to get inside your body
I run game like my name was John Gotti
Hittin' hook shots like Vlade
And niggas around my way call me Little Liberace
A lady lover like no other
And I be lethal with my weapon so they call me Danny Glover
Now who keep it hot? (We Do.)
See, So So Def ain't nothin' but a fool-ass crew
