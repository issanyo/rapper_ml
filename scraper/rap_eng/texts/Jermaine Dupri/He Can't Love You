[JD]
Oh this thing right here is So So Def

1 - [JD]
Tell me what you like
Can you tell me what you like?
Tell me what you like about him
Tell me what he does for you

Repeat 1 (3x)

[JE](JD)
As the clock strikes twelve
I'm sitting here wondering how the hell
Did I let you leave? (Uh-huh, uh)
And baby I know that I did my share (Yo)
Of things to deceive you
And I'm just trying to get an understanding of what to do
And I'm half way going crazy (Yo)

2 -	He can't love you baby
	He can't love you like I do
	He can't touch you baby
Tell me what you like about him
Tell me what he does for you
(Baby oh) Think about it, think about it
	(He can't love)
Tell me what you like about him
Tell me what he does for you

[JE](JD)
Stop (Wait) think
That I never met someone to make me feel
Like I'm ready to love
And I gotta do what I gotta do
Just to keep you here with me
Now I feel it's time for me to say
That I need you and I can't go oh yeah

Repeat 1

[JE]
You know that I ain't one to brag
But it makes me mad when I see you
Falling for a nigga fronting like it's all about you
Better than the things I do
And baby before you start to hold back
I hold back you
Remember that

[Mr. Black]
You're fooling
We know it's me that you're choosing
You likes the way I give that ass a good bruising
But he's keeping you
But he's straight lacing you
But there still ain't no replacement boo
It's like he the one you take home to mom
But you wanna keep a thug, your late night fun
Ya see I'm a real 'g' so it's all good for me
I'm from the hood so maybe this thing ain't meant to be

Repeat 2 till end
