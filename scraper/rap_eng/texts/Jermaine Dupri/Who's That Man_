Know, don't you wanna know?
Don't you wanna know?
Know, who's that man?
Know, don't you wanna know?
Don't you wanna know?
Know, who's that man?
He's got a different little style than other men today
He does his thing with a swing
And everything you see him do is in a different way
You never ever seen before
He's not your ordinary slick uptown type of brother
Don't think twice 'cause you'll never find another
There goes the man behind the mask
You've never ever seen him before
Know, don't you wanna know?
Don't you wanna know?
Know, who's that man?
Know, don't you wanna know?
Don't you wanna know?
Know, who's that man?
He's got the flava to do his his thang
He's got something everybody wish they had
And something tells me you don't wanna make him mad
No you don't, no you don't, no you don't
He's not your ordinary slick uptown type of brother
Don't think twice 'cause you'll never find another
There goes the man behind the mask
You've never ever seen him before
Know, don't you wanna know?
Don't you wanna know?
