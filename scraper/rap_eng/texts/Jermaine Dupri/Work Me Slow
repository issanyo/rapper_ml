[Verse One (Kandi):]
Play me some music, and pour me some wine
I'm in the mood now, I got love on my mind
I want you to know, that I like it real slow
And whenever your ready, you can slide off my clothes
And touch my body, anywhere
I'm yours tonight, Make it right
Baby just take me there

[Chorus:]
Take your time and work me slowly (work it)
Cause I'm the kind of girl
Who needs the kind of guy
That can last (work it, work it)
Don't need a man around
If he's slowin down too fast
You gotta work me slowly

[Verse Two (Kandi):]
Now change your position, and keep it right there
Just go with my motions, rub you hands through my hair
I hope you don't mind it, if I let out a scream
Cause it's feeling to good to me, it's more than I dreamed
It's more than pleasure, it's ecstasy
Up and down, Round and round
Baby just come with me, Take your time

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge (LaTocha):]
Then in the morning
We'll do it all over again
(We'll do it all over again)
I don't want this feeling to never end
I can't believe how your loving me
You give me all
I can't believe your still stroking me
Cause baby your taking it all

[Repeat Chorus]
