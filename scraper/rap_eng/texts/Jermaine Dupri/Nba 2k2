I got the rock, I'm bringin' it down
So you better watch the clock, I'm scorin' any second now
You can't trap me and you can't get at me
Please, don't even reach, 'cos the crossover's nasty

You see how I pick and roll then
I spin on em' and no look down
Low alley hoop then hurry up and get back on the
'Cause I'm not about to let the same thing happen to me

Still shot blocks rejections
Head check bad past interflection
Fast break in the opposite direction
Coming down with the two on one look out

Swing the ball out to the wing
The game in a clutch, so I put the tray up
That's all day you can't stop my Jay
It's NBA2K2, let's play

You can't guard me, no, you can't stick me, no
You can't hold me, no, you can't get me, no
All day my Jay is on and all day my game is on
You can't guard me, no, you can't stick me, no
You can't hold me, no, you can't get me, no
All day my Jay is on and all day my game is on

Fast breaker, play maker, dub for double lay up
We run the game, 23 won't play us
It's zone D, I V couldn't Jay
We couldn't get back down by the Lakers

We set traps, y'all, ballers couldn't break us
Start with the head faker, then I take a future Hall of Famer
Too many moves, you reach and you lose
Is it the shoes? The shoes, it's gotta be the shoes

The crowd is screamin' with amazement
Run around the screen, hit the shot while I'm fadin'
Swish and one, I got the continuation, ref give em' a tech
They be foulin' me flagrant

I take em' outside, I take em' inside
Top of the key, I take em' to the baseline
To the left, crossed em' to the right
Take flight, I'm doing this all night

'Cause you can't guard me, no, you can't stick me, no
You can't hold me, no, you can't get me, no
All day my Jay is on and all day my game is on
So come on
