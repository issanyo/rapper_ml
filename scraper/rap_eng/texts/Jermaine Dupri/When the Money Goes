[Hook x2]
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the grey skies replace the sunny days
Hey, hey, hey

When the top back, I know I got that
But when I'm locked up...
Shit, Guru, let me get that again

[Hook x2]
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the grey skies replace the sunny days
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I got it now...
When my top back, I know I got that
But when I'm locked up, and I'm not back
And I collect call, will she accept that?
Will she stay down, through my setbacks?
Through my downfalls, and my downpours
When them FBI boys is coming down for us
I know you ride with a nigga through the Gucci store
All through Prada, but what if I had nada?
Would the babe even bother if the block got hotter?
In the never-ending game that pits the cops versus robbers?
Am I your Clyde, or are you just along for the ride?
When I'm blasting out the window, will you grab the wheel and drive?

[Hook x2]
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the grey skies replace the sunny days
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
When I fall off, and the drought hits
And it knocks me, out new outfits
And the charm you got gotta hit the pawn shop
And you feel like crying, but be strong and stop
It was all good just a week ago
Now I'm wearing the same clothes a week in a row
Trying to scratch back
Would she take a little check from her little job like
"Nigga, you can have that"
You have belief in me, or would you beef with me?
Is the good life the only thing you needed from me?
Would she roll out? Is she so out, when the stoves out?
Or will she hold out?

[Hook x2]
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the grey skies replace the sunny days
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
And your friends know what Hov get it in for
But let's just say that I didn't ride Benzo
Would you say, "Girl, why you still with him for?"
And if so, babe, why you around them hoes?
All they see is paper, not potential
And they don't have a nigga's back when he's in limbo
And I ain't asking you to do a life bid with me
I don't want you to die for me, baby, live with me
I'm just saying, when the going gets rough
Don't forget all the shine at the time I was showing up
Show me the same love you showed me when blowing up
You told me it was Roc for life, then throw it up

[Hook x2]
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the grey skies replace the sunny days
Hey, hey, hey
