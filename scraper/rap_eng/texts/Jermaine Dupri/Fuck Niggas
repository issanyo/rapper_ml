[Hook: Problem]
Yeah, I've been drinking all night, smoking all day
Getting that money more work more play
A new whip outside got leather and wood
This my squad I wish you would
Got a gang of fuck niggas that be hatting on me
Got a gang of fuck niggas that be hatting on me
Got a gang of fuck niggas that be hatting on me
(On me, on me)
Fuck it keep hating ho

[Verse 1: Problem]
Ain't no rapping, no acting is what I know
Girl your man let you come at him crazy then he a ho
Cause me I ain't going for none of that, naw none of that
Pussy rain call it thundercat, where the money at?
[?] like a skully cap, with them chubby stacks
Fresh everyday boy you need a buddy pass
Keep wolfing that shit you won't get a fucking pass
Like you playing with Russell Westbrook, hold it
No speaker but this motherfucking peal got me [?]
Compton Cali blowing tree with my auntie
Team Cali throwing that bomb no Crabtree
Get money or die, ain't no plan B

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Problem]
Done, done with that talk see a mark im pressed
Run L.A hands down no questions
Me and my foolies diamond lane Los
Pop the fly shit we taking off like jets
Air a nigga out no outside
Doing stuff that's [?]
All eyes on me no bow boy
Balling? You more like a towel boy
Now give me that shit, give me that shit take it off
Give me that flick, give me that flick show it off
