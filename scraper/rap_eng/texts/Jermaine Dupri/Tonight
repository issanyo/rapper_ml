[Verse One: Kandi]
Come a little bit closer and look into my eyes
If only for a moment, boy don't be surprised
I want you right here next to me
So tell me, can we spend some time
So I can hold you softly
In these gentle arms of mine
And the moonlight's gazing
Shining on my window pane
Beaming down on the midnight hour
I hear the sound of rain

[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight, oh
Tonight, tonight, oh

[Verse Two: Tamika]
So why don't you stay awhile
I can't help it if you put me in a daze boy
But you look so good to me, me
In your satin PJs
So let's make love by candlelight
And listen to the quiet storm
As I kiss you in the places
That make your body warm

[Repeat Chorus]

I'm holding you
I'm holding you, holding you
Holding you tight all through the night
Holding you tight all through the night

Looks like it's gonna rain
Looks like it's gonna rain
Looks like it's gonna rain
Looks like it's gonna rain
Holding you tight all through the night
Holding you tight all through the night
Tonight
