(J.D.)
R.L., E-Dub (huh huh Def Squad) So So Def

(Erick Sermon)
Yo peep the game two industry kids
One of us 'contagious' like Mr. Biggs
Two never fib
True; rest at crib
Live, with a model chick and one kid
You ain't trill
You pimp still
With no game, buying them chicks with small fame yeah
I'm here boy to bust your bubble
R.L., J.D. and me? I'm E double

(R.L.)
Everybody, they ask me
Who they girl? as she walks past them
She's mine though, and she knows that I'll never let her go
So she grabs my hand, let's all the fellas know that I'm her man
She pulls me close and dances slow
Then whispers in my ear let's go

(Chante Moore)
We can do whatever it is that you wanna do
As long as I can spend my whole night with you

(R.L)
Jump in, my whip, and go back to my crib for some touching

[Chorus]

It's a nice body
(I got me a model)
She can't look like a shorty
(I got me a model)
She knows how to party
(I got me a model)
I gotta tell somebody
(I got me a model)
She ain't level headed
(I got me a model)
Thinkin' bow legged
(I got me a model)
So why ain't Mama trickin'
(I got me a model)
Fellas get to listen
(I got me a model)

[R.L.]
Check
She's bangin', tonight
I'm speaking of this girl of mine
She got me, no lie
I think I found the love of my life
So sexy, so fly
Ease the way to my six parked outside
She wants me, it's time
Then she looks me in my eyes and says (Let's go)

(Chante Moore)
We can do whatever it is that you wanna do
As long as I can spend my whole nights with you

(R.L)
Jump in, my whip, and go back to my crib for some touching

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
She's a chick who you speak to
I let her freak too
Put your hands up high let me know I speak true
I'm a tell you, what you gon' do
Don't you dare let her loose
Listen when she tell you

(Erick Sermon)
Ayo it's me again
Erick Sermon
Say ah that's my friend
When I walk by haters cringe
I shine like rims
When I rock they get's Ugly like Bubba Sparxxx and Tim
Plus when I come through, got my chick with me
Brown skin 5' 10" a buck 50
That's what I'm talkin' bout
And Michael Johnson jumpin out the gate
Chill she says

(Chante Moore)
We can do whatever it is that you wanna do
As long as I can spend my whole night with you

(R.L)
Jump in, my whip, and go back to my crib for some touching

(Chorus)
