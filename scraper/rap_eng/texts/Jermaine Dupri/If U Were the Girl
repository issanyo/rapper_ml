Let's kick a little something for
All dem cars out their that be ballin'
Uh uh uh uh
Mo what's up?

Chorus
If u were the girl would you stay trippin'
If u were the girl would you deal with
Long stress heartache all the nights you would
Wait for the phone ring is it fair

If u were the girl would you be a rider
If u were the girl could you still try work it out
Talk it out would you stay around while I play around

Verse 1
Could you deal with me comin' home
Every night when I want to
And when you ask where I been
I just give you the same excuse
Knowing that I was up in the club
With my girls like I ain't
Got a curfew smelling like liquor
Shy cause you still sittin' up
Now could you deal with that?
If u were the girl

Chorus
If u were the girl would you stay trippin'
If u were the girl would you deal with
All the stress heartache all the nights you would
Wait for the phone ring is it fair

If u were the girl would you be a rider
If u were the girl could you still try work it out
Talk it out would you stay around while I play around

Verse 2

Or would you start an argument
Or just let it all ride
And get some sleep tonite
And then bring it up soon
As you open your eyes cause
It's been on your mind
But I can do a whole
Story why I was late
Hoping you believe me
And this don't make
Up and want leave me can u take
All this and still love me

Chorus
If u were the girl would you stay trippin'
If u were the girl would you deal with
All the stress heartache all the nights you would
Wait for the phone ring is it fair

If u were the girl would you be a rider
If u were the girl could you still try work it out
Talk it out would you stay around while I play around

Hook

I'm down with you baby
I'll ride for the cause
Even through all the stress
You still my dog and
If anything should happen to
You I'm right there
You know all you gotta do is call
Repeat 1x

Repeat chorus 3x
