Oh yeah

Will you love me for life (love me for life)
Always treat me right
Will you be the one I take home to momma
'Cause a friend to my heart
And a hand to you
For the rest of my life (oh yeah yeah)

All ya life you look for that special someone
You can share everything with and have big fun
Hoping one day you find
Everything you see in your dream
Problems will occur
Feelings will get hurt
But as long as you love
The one that you're with
You can make everything work out

I would like to wait for my hero
'Cause everyday I turn away another zero
And I just can't think of settling down
With anyone but you (oh)

Will you love me for life
Always treat me right (treat me right)
Will you be the one I take home to momma (mmm)
'Cause a friend to my heart
And a hand to you
For the rest of my life (for the rest of my life)

I find it hard to be in my situation
When you're in love
There can be no explanation
Why do you have to be so far away from me
Time waits for no one
You are that special someone
And I want to spend my whole life with you
And make this a happy home

I would like to wait for my hero
'Cause everyday I turn away another zero
And I just can't think of settling down
With anyone but you

I will love you, yeah
Will you love me for life (oh, love me for life)
Always treat me right (treat me right)
Will you be the one I take home to momma (home to momma)
'Cause a friend to my heart (oh yeah)
And a hand to you
For the rest of my life (oh, for the rest of my life)

Many days come and go
Still no words from you
You're still thinking things through
Thinking things through
About what, what it is you're gonna do
All I want is your love in return (ooh)

Will you love me for life (love me for life)
Always treat me right (treat me right)
Will you be the one I take home to momma (yeah, to momma)
'Cause a friend to my heart (oh, a friend to)
And a hand to you
For the rest of my life (for the rest of my life, yeah)
