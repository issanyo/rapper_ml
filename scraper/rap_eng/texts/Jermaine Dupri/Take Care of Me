[Da Brat]
It's Tim and Bob again
Chante Moore again
All up in that, oww goodnes
What'chu talking about?
It's so hot
We can't be stop
Come on

[Verse 1: Chante]
Baby before you go hanging out tonight
Something you already know
Don't let them get you caught up

[B-Section:]
Every thing that you do
Could come back on you
I'm not saying that you're playing
I'm not saying you're gaming me
But all your boys don't have a lady
Looking for someone just like me
Be careful

[Chorus:]
Boy, go out there, have your fun
Just remember number one
Take care of, take care of me
You're gonna do what you do
But if you gamble, you could lose
Take care of, take care of me

[Verse 2:]
Just before you go
You know I'm open, wide open
(I'm open)
You ought to act like you know
Even when I'm not around
(You know)

[B-Section]

[Chorus] (2x)

[Rap: Da Brat]
Just realize any time you choose to hang
How I throw that thing and you scream for Chante
Splish, splash, gush, push
Take care of this platinum bush
I was born, Shawntae Harris
Warning Tim and Bob that I rockin' with Chante Moore
So take care of me
When it rain or even on sunny days
When you hit the club with your boys looking for ladies
None of them niggas ain't got a woman like you
That can take care of home and the bills too
Cook up a hot meal and make you feel good
Get you hot with it, not trip about you kickin' it
Just keep the conversation limited with them hoes
It could get serious when it come to
My money, my music, or my nigga, Whoa!
Take care of me

[Chorus]
