[Intro]
Check it out
I'm saying
You gonna be mine

[Verse 1]
First time I saw you, baby, you did something to me
That no else has ever done
It's something in your eyes caught me by surprise
And told me that you were the one

[Bridge 1]
But what's bad is I know you got a man
And he'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you
Something inside of me
Is saying you and I were meant to be
If you can think it, you can have it
That why I believe...

[Chorus]
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around

[Verse 2]
Now, every time I see you, baby, it's plain to see
That I'm everything you've been missing at home, baby
So much love to share, it's something in the air
Telling me I should never leave you alone

[Bridge 2]
But even though I know you got a man
He'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you
You can try to stop it, but it won't quit
You say you don't when I know that you want it
I know, one day you'll be mine

[Chorus]
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
