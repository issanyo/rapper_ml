[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Miss Mulatto, Lil Niqo, Lil Poopy, Supa Peach

[Verse 1: Young Lyric]
Young Lyric! (Lets Go), Uh
They call me lyric cause I'm lyrical
Not like any other individual, I
Am indivisible, you should wanna be invisible
It could get physical, guarantee you I will not lose
Only 15 got em' singing the blues
Leave em' in critical condition that’s what I do, I do
Position myself to be better than you, than you
To me it ain’t nothing, I play by my rules
End of discussion I lit up a fuse
Blew up you and ya' whole crew, BOOM!
Watch it, colossal 2016 (crew, crew)

[Verse 2: Lil Niqo]
I’m ridin’ clean through the city, like a 6 four impala
Been warming up for a minute
I guess I'm just getting hotter
So fresh I still pop my collar
I'm a boss you a toddler
Fake friends like 4 quarters cause they change for a dollar, (hold up)
Switch up the flow, just copped some Jordan’s I need me some mo’
Leading a marathon homie you slow
Need a feature? Let my manager know
You ain’t talking business then I gotta go
I don’t need the key I kick open the door
Can’t see a red light when you always on go
Pop a goal you know I gotta score, Niqo yeah

[Chorus: Miss Mulatto]
I say uh, you got a flow that’s cool with me
I say uh, you got a show that’s cool with me
Uh, you got a lil' dough, lil' jewelry
Uh, wait nun' of y'all, nun' of y'all can fool with me
I say uh, you got a flow that’s cool with me
I say uh, you got a show that’s cool with me
Uh, you got a lil' dough, lil' jewelry
Uh, but nun' of y'all, nun' of y'all can fool with me

[Verse 3: Supa Peach]
Introducing and lettin’ the beast loose
Have ah some of that Supa Peach Juice
To eat you, feel like they can fade me, I will eat you
When I spit flows and I kick in doors that ain’t never been open before
When you see me on yo' TV, when they hear me on the radio
It's Supa Peach I got the super heat
Guaranteed you love me at the meet and greet
Cause I'm cocky and I'm humble
Don’t believe me? just watch me
I fumbles, no pass, touchdown, first class
Some of y'all ain’t got no class
Peachy to teach you ya' manners

[Verse 4: Miss Mulatto]
I go by Mula, two T’s and a O
Or maybe I should go by Kurtis cause you know I'm finna blow
Poppin' like a can of coke
Rappers be so typical
Think twice 'fore you come for me cause these hits ain’t just digital
Hit with the flow, try to keep up
Bout to set it off, no Latifah
Not the one to go back and forth, no Venus and Serena
South side I'm the queen of
Gotta pay me for a feature
These kids ain’t ready for me yet so I'm like a margarita, UH!!

[Verse 5: Lil Poopy]
P-double-O-P-Y
Poopy this Poopy that
King of the Brock and you know that’s a fact
Flipping these tracks like I'm flipping these stacks
Killing these records like back to back
Hold Up!
I did it again, ball so hard I'ma get me a ten
I hit the mall just to ball out and spend
Not by myself, all of my friends
You copy my swag? I'm setting trends
I dip and dab I got the swag
Green eyes cause I see cash
With the flash, so I'm like flash
Your flow is so trash
It’s Poopy doing me, can catch me up in that Eds class
