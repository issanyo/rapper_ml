Verse 1

I've been keeping super quiet now I’m coming back
This an introduction but its good enough to be a hit
Niggas asking JD can you tell us where the hell you've been
If you asking where I've been dawg this RIP
I don’t wanna talk about your chick nigga you spare me please
Honestly, if she's not with me then I do not know who's she with
And I'm sick, Michael Jordan I make all your girls do them nasty splits
Looking at me dawg and you niggas know I'm super lit
Heard you taking shots man it's all good
When I shoot back I take shots like I'm Hollywood
And I'm cruel, if I take a shot you might never move ( never move)
Nigga what you trying to do here’s one for the books
Niggas they like JD dawg you forgot about the streets
Nigga please, I’m streetwise like I'm KFC
And I got myself a wrist
And its cold and its mint
It don’t tick tock man it "Tic Tac"  (ey)

(They like JD kill shit, JD kill that shit)

It don't tick tock man it Tic Tac

[ Outro]

On the other hand ain't you glad that I'm back
Yeah (uh uh uh) and I’m back
I say what I want I don't care how you react
Niggas talk a lot but you can not swallow the facts
Here's this here's that
Nigga how about this, how about this
LOL, LOL, thought this was a joke then you laughing on your own
Yeah you probably laughing on your own
