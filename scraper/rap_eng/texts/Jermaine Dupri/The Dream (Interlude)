Mmmm, i'm so bored right now
Oh, i should call jermaine
And tell him to come pick me up in the bentley
And take us to the airport
So we can fly on his private jet to paris
And i could pick up these shoes i saw the other day on the way to the spot

Bitch you ain't bored
You out your damn mind
Jermaine ain't pickin you up and flyin yo ass no where to pick up some shoes
I'll tell you what
You betta pick yourself up and run down to payless
And get those shoes you saw on the way to the check cashin joint
Oh this bitch is too funny
I suppose you think that can of grape soda you drinkin is a glass of crystal too
Next thing you know
You gon tell me lil bow wow gonna pick you up in his big wheel
And to all you other day dreamers out there
Wake the f**k up
