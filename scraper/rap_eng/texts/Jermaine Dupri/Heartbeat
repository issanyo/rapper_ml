[Intro]
Before I met you
My life was so different
It was like my emotions were asleep
Well, you've awakened them
And now I'm in love with you
And everytime I see you
My heart skips a beat

[Verse 1]
Once I was so alone, my heat had no fire
Baby, I was working but I was so uninspired
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for romance
But somehow love, it found me
And then my heart began to dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]
Baby, ooh, baby, ooh (come closer)
Baby, you, baby, you make my heart beat
Baby, ooh, baby, ooh (come closer)
Baby, you, baby, you make my heart beat

[Verse 2]
The closer I get to you, my lips are smilin'
The beat goes twice the tempo
Temperatures risin'
Now I'm thinkin' bout love, thinkin' 'bout your body
Whenever you're around me
You make my heart begin to dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]
Baby, ooh, baby, ooh (come closer)
Baby, you, baby, you make my heart beat
Baby, ooh, baby, ooh (come closer)
Baby, you, baby, you make my heart beat

[Bridge]
Funny how love can change even the simplest things
Baby, when you touch me (oh)
Baby, when you kiss me (oh)
Oh, there's something 'bout your loving, boy
That makes my, makes my heart wanna dance
Yeah, you've got the power, baby
I wanna dance
I love what you're doing to me, baby
I wanna dance, I wanna dance
Will you dance with me, baby?

[Chorus]
Baby, ooh, baby, ooh
Baby, you, baby, you make my heart beat
(You make my heart beat)
Baby, ooh, baby, ooh
Baby, you, baby, you make my heart beat
Baby, ooh, baby, ooh
Baby, you, baby, you make my heart beat
(You make my heart beat)
Baby, ooh, baby, ooh
Baby, you, baby, you make my heart beat
(You make my heart beat)
Baby, ooh, baby, ooh
Baby, you, baby, you make my heart beat
Baby, ooh, baby, ooh...
