[Intro: Master P (Jermaine Dupri)]

[Hook: Master P & Jermaine Dupri]
J got the shorties and uhh (P came to party and uhh)
We got it started from that Dirty South (ha hah) ya heard me?
(Aiyyo, I like platinum) I like gold
My real niggas don't spend money on hoes
What you workin wit? (P what you workin wit?)
J what you twerkin wit? (P what you twerkin wit?)
Ha hah, J got the shorties and uhh (P came to party and uhh)
We got it started from that Dirty South, ya heard me?
(Aiyyo, I like platinum) I like gold
But real niggas don't spend money on hoes
What you workin wit? (P what you twerkin wit?)
J what you workin wit? (P what you twerkin wit?)

[MP] I got a bubble-I Hummer, couple of boats on the beach
I got three hundred on my wrist and a hundred on my teeth
[JD] Well I know they sick of this, talk about what I got
Nigga with the quickness, but I don't give a fuck
[MP] J fuck what they think, I put ice on my tank
A couple of million in the bank and Cristal is our drink
[JD] Well where we from, niggas with the most shit rule
Hit all ya hoes, rock all the jewels
Make all the moves niggas dream about
You know the type niggas y'all can't keep out your mouth, uhh

[Hook]

[Master P]
I was on the cover of Fortune but you know I ain't flossin
I need two armored cars for all the bread I'm tossin
I got a marble pool table, gold nine for the haters
Hustler and a player, got a mansion with elevator
We, ghetto millionaires, we shine like stars
And roll through the hood in the tightest of cars

[Jermaine Dupri]
Well to me a flooded Roley's like a Swatch watch
And a Lex is like a V-Dub, y'all niggas can't keep up
Since day one I've been on burn
Had hits back when most of y'all was interns, huh
You know the game, yo' bitch chose me
The name? Capital J, Capital D (whoa)

[Hook]
