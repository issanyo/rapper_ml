(feat. Jermaine Dupri)

[Verse 1:]
I know some people might not understand me
I might not go number 1 or win a grammy
But uh
I done, done the lovin, I done, done the touchin
All the kissing and hugging baby you know its nothing
Everybody know that I can oh-oh
Ladies love it when I go oh-oh

[JD:]
You trying to stop all that?

[Avant:]
No

[JD:]
Well brother please can you make me understand what you?re sayin

[Avant:]
Listen man
Troubles of the world today
Its got me heated
Every word I?m about to say
I feel is needed
So let me talk about the things that?s goin on (going on)
The war is over but the troops ain?t home
I see the bullies flying, see the people dying
See the babies crying
Whats the reason

[JD:]
So who you supposed to be Public Enemy #1
Now next thing I know you?re gonna be trying to tell me to put my guns down

[Avant:]
I?m trying to have a conversation with you fore you let these streets get you
Show you a bigger picture than standing on this block

[JD:]
You wanna talk well where the -- at
Cause homie I don?t need that
Stuff you talking what I?m doin ain?t never gonna stop
You must been watching too much CNN
It?s about them dividends
The hood ain?t change I don?t know where you been
-- everybody suffering, and its way more tougher than it was
And we don?t never see nobody helping us

[Avant:]
Okay
That?s so true
I can feel your pain
I?m not here to argue
Just put you up on game
But I guess you the type I can?t tell a damn thing
Couple of dollars in your pocket and you start losing your brain
It?s a trap
Got you hustling all through the night
It?s a trap
They takin pictures in broad daylight
Don?t let the system trick you into nothing else
Please
Be a man and stand for yourself
If you not rich by now you probably never get it
How can I get this -- to listen to what I?m sayin to him
Don?t be a fool with that ?I don?t give a damn? attitude
Cause I know you got someone at home that you in love with

[Avant:]
I?m trying to have a conversation with you fore you let these streets get you
Show you a bigger picture than standing on this block

[JD:]
You wanna talk well where the -- at
Cause homie I don?t need that
Stuff you talking what I?m doin ain?t never gonna stop

[Avant:]
Please listen
Hear me when I say don?t
Let this system knock you
Lock your ass away cause
You got things to live for, your family and your children
Don?t want to lose the life that you?ve been living

[JD:]
Stuff you talking what I?m doin ain?t never gonna stop

[Avant:]
Please listen (please listen)
Hear me when I say don?t (I got some serious words for you my brothers)
Let this system knock you (90% of us on lockdown)
Lock your ass away cause (and we don?t need another)
You got things to live for, your family and your children
(oh, so many brothers doing life can?t see their kids, I?m so sincere)
Don?t want to lose the life that you?ve been living (I?m so sincere)
So sincere?

Cut!
