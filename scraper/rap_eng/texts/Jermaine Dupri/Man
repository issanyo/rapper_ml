[Verse 1]
When I first saw you, I had nothing to compare to
How could I recognize the man of a life time?
But when you first told me of the secrets deep within me
I had to admit, this is it
If it not had been for told
The love that would unfold
Can't wait 'til it overflows
Just look no one even knows
I can't deny it, I'm ready to try
When I look in your eyes, I feel butterflies

[Chorus]
Ya, ya, pa, pa, man, man, man
Man, oh, man, man of a life time
Ya, ya, pa, pa, man, man, man
Man, oh, man, man of a life time

[Verse 2]
You know I had to get near you
'Cause you're pullin' my trigger duck
I'm bout to blow
I think you know your fulfilling my fantasies
I had before you and me
You knew without know
And my mind is blowing
Come take a trip, come take a dip
I think I knew what eve felt before they slipped
Safe in your arms, deep in your arms
I've waited so long to sing you this song

[Chorus]
Ya, ya, pa, pa, man, man, man
Man, oh, man, man of a life time
Ya, ya, pa, pa, man, man, man
Man, oh, man, man of a life time
Ya, ya, pa, pa, man, man, man
Man, oh, man, man of a life time (man of a life time)
Ya, ya, pa, pa, man, man, man
Man, oh, man, man of a life time (man of a life time)

[Breakdown]

[Chorus]
Ya, ya, pa, pa, man, man, man
Man, oh, man, man of a life time
Ya, ya, pa, pa, man, man, man
Man, oh, man, man of a life time (man of a life time)
Ya, ya, pa, pa, man, man, man
Man, oh, man, man of a life time (man of a life time)
Ya, ya, pa, pa, man, man, man
Man, oh, man, man of a life time (yeah, yeah)
