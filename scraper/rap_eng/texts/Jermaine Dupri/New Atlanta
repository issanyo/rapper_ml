[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I told ya'll niggas long time ago
Come fuck with my city, nah mean?
Rich Homies, Migos, Young Thug, and me motherfucker
Yo, yo, yo, you know what I'm saying?
When you get off that motherfucking plane

[Hook: Quavo, (Rich Homie Quan) & (Young Thug)]
(Welcome to Atlanta baby) You never been to Atlanta?
Welcome to new Atlanta, Phantoms on top of Phantoms
(Get at new Atlanta baby) Hannah Montana boo'd up in Atlanta
New Atlanta, we don't need security, walking around with that hammer
Bring out the cameras (ca-camera babe)
(Porno movie, fuck your camera baby)
(Don't get your bitch ass killed in new Atlanta baby)
(We don't fuck with cameras, I'll hit em for real)
(Fuck the police we won't tell, we keeping it trill)
(In new Atlanta baby)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Crossover spaghetti junction
Northside Migo bando bunkin'
Lil' momma she foreign, she not from this country
Fly to Atlanta, we land in the morning
Droppin' my top on the avenue!
Young nigga, you stay with your mama, call you Bartholomew
Come to Atlanta, we breakin' the rules
Do you remember my teachers said we wouldn't make it
I gotta thank y'all, Atlanta made us famous
Across the world, we in Venezuela
We live in Atlanta, might have some haters
The new Atlanta like the old Lakers

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I'm a young rich nigga, whippin' up chemicals
Middle of the summer wearin' chinchillas
Up through the city Atlanta with your bitch
She poppin' that pussy, no pimple
It's been a long time coming, Migos, Thug, Rich Homie
No we don't fuck with no phonies
You niggas be cloning, they watching like Sony (you copy me)
Momma said I was a born star
Came out the pussy with a spatula
Selling dope like Pablo Escobar
I'm hot, they lookin' for me switchin' cars
Bentley Mulsanne I just blew out the brain
Of the Audi R8 with the paper temp plate
Takeoff and Thug, Offset, Quavo, Quan
New Atlanta, we the heavyweight

[Hook:]
(Welcome to Atlanta baby) You never been to Atlanta?
Welcome to new Atlanta, Phantoms on top of Phantoms

[Verse 3: Offset]
I had the desire, we startin' empires
You niggas retired, Givenchy attire
I'm trappin', they think that I live in The Wire
I had to flood out my new Audemars
Drop in the Ghost, scaring niggas like Michael Myers
Fuckin' your bitch, pass her out like a flyer
All the lil' kids lookin' at me admiring
I pull up in 'Raris, I Forgi my tires
I'm dropping a four in my Tropicana
This the New Atlanta, pullin' up in Phantoms
For you niggas that monkey, we got bananas
Throw a temper tantrum when I'm on the channel
We finessin' that counting up in Atlanta
Put a price on your head like a bandana (there go 12!)
Dipset, like Juelz Santana
I'm dropping the top on my panoramic

[Interlude: Jermaine Dupri]
Motherfuckers hatin' and shit
Motherfuckers still moving out here and shit
It's still love in this motherfucker
And niggas think this shit gon' stop
It ain't never gon' stop, it's just gon' keep going
Rich Homie, tell 'em where you're from

[Verse 4: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
A-T-L-A-N-T-A, GA that where I'm from
East Atlanta, that where I stay, aka the slums (east Atlanta)
I got, I got trained to slime without a gun
Migos and Quan roll up another one
Doctors don't know what we on
Magic City still poppin' on Mondays, ain't no more 20 grams
New Atlanta, we stuntin', I keep me like 20 bands
Shawty Lo lifestyle, Iâ€™m the man, got your main ho head in my hand
I ain't Future but I'm having free bands, I can't help who I amTell 'em Quan
I can't help who I'm is or where I'm from
Welcome to Atlanta, where you better watch your tongue
Hey, I did dirt for this water, I feel like a pond
I'm from Bleveland, Rich Homie Quan, tell 'em where you from
