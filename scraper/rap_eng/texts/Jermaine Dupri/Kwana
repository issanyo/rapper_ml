[Verse 3: JD]
This is not the 10th grade
So can we stop with all the child's play
You know I've been working overtime everyday
So you won't really get to see me everyday
Girl you know
I need you to
When it comes to you I can't control
Despite all the girls i keep running through
I belong to you
Make it drop drop drop drop
So I can lift it up up up up
All the fighting needs to stop stop stop stop
All I want is your love love love
Me and you made a connection
Me and you made a sensation
No girl can bring competition
So get to the loving
Stop being childish

[Chorus: Smurf]
I tell her baby say '' I Love You'' wooohh yeah
