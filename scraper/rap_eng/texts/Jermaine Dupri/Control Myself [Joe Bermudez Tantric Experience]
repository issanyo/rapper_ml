[Intro: Jermaine Dupri & Jennifer Lopez]
Say what?
Uh-huh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Say what?
Uh-huh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
No me puedo controlar
Aqui con el Se√±or LL Cool J
Y aqui estoy... ya tu sabes
Uno, dos, tres, muevete!
Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance
Come on
Uh, yeah
Come on
I need everybody to report to the dancefloor right now
Let's dance
Woo!
Let's dance
Uh, uh, come on
You got, you got
You got, you got
Ah, ah
You got, you got
Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah
You got, you got
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined (Uh-huh!)
My brain began to sizzle
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy go bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
Come on, yeah, me too
You got, you got
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, me too
You got, you got
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, me too

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're wilding like we're lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin'
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'
Her moves were so erotic (Come on)
Her gaze was so hypnotic (Come on)
I begged this girl to stop it
But she continued to pop it (Woah)
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the after party is at my body
Meet me you're invited

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy go bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
Come on, yeah, me too
You got, you got
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, me too
You got, you got
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth (Uh-huh)
Side, to side, and up, and down (Ayy, haha)
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire (Uh-huh)
Lord help me douse this fire (Uh-huh)
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo (Come on)
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy go bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
Come on, yeah, me too
You got, you got
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, me too
You got, you got
Oh, oh, oh

[Interlude: Jermaine Dupri]
Uh, yeah, I need everybody to report to the dance floor
Right now
Woo!
Uh, uh, uh

Back and forth, side to side

Back and forth, turn me out

Back and forth, and up and down
Back and forth, turn me out
