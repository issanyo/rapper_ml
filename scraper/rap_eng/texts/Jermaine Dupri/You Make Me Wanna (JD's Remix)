Verse 1: Usher

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend             [JD] Hahaha!
The one I used to run to when me and my
Girl was having problems                 [JD] Thats right!
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do   [JD] Uhuh!
And when I go home at night
And lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you
And how...

Chorus: Usher

...you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you,       (Oh, yeah...) [JD] Get 'em up!
(4X)
This is what you do!                     (Ah, yeah!)
Think about her and all the things
That come along with,                    (... come along with,)
You make me...                           (you make me...)
You make me...                           (You make me...)

Verse 2: Usher

Now what's bad
Is you're the one that hooked us up!
Knowing it should've been you!           [JD] Ha!
What's sad is that I love her
But I'm falling for you!                 [JD] Uhuh!
What should I do?
Should I...
... tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I...                              [JD] Uh-uh!
... do exactly what I feel inside?
Cause I...
... I don't wanna go
Don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together!

Chorus: Usher

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh!)

Verse 3: Usher

At this point...                         [JD] Say what?
... the situation's out of control!
I never meant to hurt her but I...
... gotta let her go!                    (Gotta let her go!)
And she... may not understand it
Why all of this is going on!
I tried...
I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong!

You make, make, make me!                    (You make me wanna, wanna, wanna
Wanna!)
