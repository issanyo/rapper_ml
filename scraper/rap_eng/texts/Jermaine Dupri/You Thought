Ah man ah man you speaking that nonsense again

You telling me that you so cool but you just flexing in front of your friends

You, you, you and your whole crew tell, me what you gonna do

Suited and booted kind of revenue

The type of the things kids would never do

I don't even know we're to start I am the youngest in charge

Can't be concerned with you, I never heard of you, I dont even know who you are



A young cat got cream Im living it up with your girl on my team



So get out the way

I'm taking the lane get yo own so don't come in my way

You saying you better than me better than me ha you thought



Saying you trynna run up on me

I ain't got the keys ha you wrong

Trynna hate on me boy you cheap that something like a groupon

I ain't got nothing to say get outta my way getting rappers like you thought

I dont know what you thinking I be killing they just pheaning

I'm to realling I'm utinded like boy I just shutup em up



No debating you just hating imma eat you keep mistaking don't have answers I swear I am gonna take the chain I swear people gonna know my name



Latto you tell me who hotter than me see all the spots they got shadows for me



Take about my crap that's best for me I got people that's blessed for me skate boy trynna ask for the key



And you mad because jermaine dupri is asking for me



They blessed for me don't know what you thought



Dont know what you thought

Mula be getting that moolah

I got my eyes on my own penny been trynna get it don't know what you thought



I don't care what you got

Get back get wack all dat big dog big shot watch out lot of money coming through o my god



Woah I just be rocking that show

Jimmy Higgins with the guitar

A lot of em try but they don't get far



They said I wouldn't be nothing

Go on these tracks don't even be cussing don't even be fronting don't gotta be bluffing

And now you everything you said that I wasn't whoo!
