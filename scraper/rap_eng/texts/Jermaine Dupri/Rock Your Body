Show me can you do it good

[Chorus:]
Rock your body
Take my hand and follow me
Rock your body
‘Cause you’re the baddest thing I’ve ever seen
Rock your body
I like the way you move with it
Groove with it to the music
Rock your body
Come on and get closer, closer, closer

[Rap: Jermaine Dupri]
If you see something you like holding up the wall
Grab it (rock that body)
Walk straight up to him and tell him
That you gotta have it (rock that body)
When the beat come on
If you feel it in your back, you need to (rock that body)
If you’re on the floor, put your hands in the air
Let me see you (ooh, rock rock rock rock rock rock rock rock)

[Verse 1:]
I’m checking out your body, baby
You’re here and are you gonna bring
The crew that you came here with
The way that you handle it
There you are
Looking like a superstar
Chillin’ in the VIP
Lookin’ so good to me
I wanna

[Chorus:]
Rock your body
Take my hand and follow me
Rock your body
‘Cause you’re the baddest thing I’ve ever seen
Rock your body
I like the way you move with it
Groove with it to the music
Rock your body
Come on and get closer, closer, closer

[Rap: Jermaine Dupri]
If you see something you like holding up the wall
Grab it (rock that body)
Walk straight up to him and tell him
That you gotta have it (rock that body)
When the beat come on
If you feel it in your back, you need to (rock that body)
If you’re on the floor, put your hands in the air
Let me see you (rock that body)

[Verse 2:]
I’m checkin’ out your attitude
The way you do, the way you do
You got me so into you
I want you, I want you
Get me out on the floor
And give me what I came here for
You’re moving like I know you could
Show me can you do it good

[Chorus:]
Rock your body
Take my hand and follow me
Rock your body
‘Cause you’re the baddest thing I’ve ever seen
Rock your body
I like the way you move with it
Groove with it to the music
Rock your body
Come on and get closer, closer, closer

[Rap: Jermaine Dupri]
