[Jermaine Dupri]
So So Def
All I do is rock girl
What about you?
What about you?
All I do is rock girl
What about you?
What about you?

[3rd Storee](JD)
Someone's in love with you (Uh-huh)
Don't you know? (Yeah)
They just don't wanna let their feelings show (Nah uh-uh)
Cause their not sure that you can feel the same
Wanna make sure that you (What?)
Feel the same way

[3rd Storee](JD)
Yeah, so now he would like to take a chance (Yeah, uh-huh)
In hopes that you both will find romance (Yeah, ya know)
In case that you're willing
There's something I'm feeling (Ha-ha)
There's something that I want you to know (Lil' Man say what?)

[3rd Storee](JD)
Girl if ever you call me (Check)
I'll be there for you right or wrong
Girl if ever you need me
I'll promise I will give you my all
(Watch this)

[3rd Storee](JD)
Someone who will love and sacrifice (Ha, yeah)
Who knows what it means to treat you right
Someone who won't change his mind (Yeah)
Willing to give his time (Uh-huh)
One who will always feel the same (Come on)

[3rd Storee](JD)
He wants you to open up your heart
(This the part I like)
In hopes you will start
To love him in every way
He likes to take a chance
In hopes that you'll find romance
In hopes that you'll always feel the same
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)

[3rd Storee](Baby Stase)
Girl if ever you call me
(Uh Harlem World we don't stop)
I'll be there for you right or wrong
(Baby Stase you don't stop, let's go, let's go, let's go)
Girl if ever you need me
(Uh Harlem World we don't stop)

(Baby Stase you don't stop, get money world, get money)

[Baby Stase](JD)
Yo if you need me, feed me
But don't be pity, be easy
That's the way you greet me
You saw on the cd, I write it
You saw me on your TV (I like it)
You're talking 'bout the way that I dance
The way that I move
You young man better stay in school
Keep it brief, keep it sweet
I ain't gonna tell a story
Baby Stase, make it hot
Don't stop the story

[Loon]
You ain't never too young to fall in love
But see I never had a chance to fall in love
I used to ball with thugs get it on with slugs
Young cat, one gat, running all the drugs
Then I changed my life even changed my ice
My girl was actin' up so I changed my wife
JD took a player out this dangerous life
Harlem World, All Out baby name your price what?

[3rd Storee](JD)
Girl if ever you call me
(Rock on)
I'll be there for you right or wrong
(Harlem World rock on)
Girl if ever you need me
(So So Def rock on)
I'll promise I will give you my all
(All around the world, ha)
Girl if ever you call me
I'll be there for you right or wrong
Girl if ever you need me
I'll promise I will give you my all
Girl if ever you call me
I'll be there for you right or wrong
Girl if ever you need me
I'll promise I will give you my all
