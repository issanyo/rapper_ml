[Intro]
You know like I know you ain't never ever met nobody like me
You know like I know you ain't never ever met nobody like me

Chorus
You never met a girl like me
I ain't goin' such other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down low chick on ya team

[Verse 1]
I might wake you up in the morning and cook for you
If you having problem with a song I'll write a hook for you
11:30 at night I ain't gonna look for you
Cause I know you coming home with me
I will never stress you or make you feel misled
If you wanna go to the movies I'll flip it instead
You don't pay me
I get this with my bread my bread
Cause you know my money ain't a thang a thang

[Chorus]
You never met a girl like me
I ain't goin' such other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down low chick on ya team
You never met a girl like me
I ain't goin' such other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down low chick on ya team

[Verse 2]
If you trying to be out to the party I'll let you go
If you want be out with somebody that's when I show
You do as you please cause baby that's how you know that
There's no other place that I'd rather go
I ain't trying to be fussin' and fightin' up on yo' back
Anytime you need me you know that I'm getting yo'back
Ain't no one like me I want you to know that know that
I ain't changing nothing cause it's like that like that

[Bridge]
I know you're used to lovers
That treat you like your mother
So I know it's hard to understand when I say
I'm your girl but I'm like your man
No matter if it's sweet talk or street talk
I'm right here by your side
And soon you'll come to see
How it is to be
Down with a chick like me

[Chorus 4x]
