[Chorus]
That I shouldn't smoke weed and shit, huh
That I should cuss and shit, huh
That I shouldn't do the shit I wanna do
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I don't give a fuck about what these niggas think
That's they beliefs, here go mine

[Verse 1]
I gets embedded in your cerebellum, deeper than the ocean
Focusin' on fuckin' a nigga up, who got jokes?
Provoke me, my vision of lust is money, trust is funny
Too many sheisty motherfuckers comin' for me
One in the chamber, ready for repetition if possible
Hate to mention this, poppin' that nigga, bitch
It be the intellectual, get sexual in a second heffer
You could never be no competition to me
You bit the poison apple, tryin' adapt to this shit
Show you how it happened
While we laughin', diggin' your ditch
And you can get your boys
I got Disciples and ViceLords
Planted through every city ready, declare war
If you feel I stepped on your toes
It was intentionally
Cause it was meant to be the shit since I found JD
My lyrical thesis broke in pieces
For you pussies who can't feed off it
Everything'll be fine, just hit the weed often

[Chorus]
That I shouldn't smoke weed and shit, huh
That I should cuss and shit, huh
That I shouldn't do the shit I wanna do
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I don't give a fuck about what these niggas think
That's they beliefs, here go mine
That I shouldn't smoke weed and shit, huh
That I should cuss and shit, huh
That I shouldn't do the shit I wanna do
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I don't give a fuck about what these niggas think
That's they beliefs, here go mine

[Verse 2]
I believe good things come to those that grind
Never take a step back, leave the past behind
Keep your mind on some money and don't ever stop tryin'
And everything'll be fine, everything'll be fine
It's time to let your lighter spark
Crank up the weed session
With one of the best in the Midwestern section
Flexin' with no shame
Cause a mi solo female MC's be back in the game
Sun up to sun down I puff leaves
Filled with imported trees from the West Indies
Chi-town's finest in more ways than one
Me follow in the path of another, days is done
See I got mic checkin' down to a science
Meanin' I perfected the ways
To shit on you and your alliance
I write the type of shit that'll hypnotize ya
Fuck around and kill your whole click like Kaiser
In the streets of Prazza, the Westside of niggas
Ain't expects, smellin' like cannibus
Can't nothin' handle this
They wanna dismantle this but it will never go down
Shit, cause my beliefs is I'm the baddest around, bitch

[Chorus]
That I shouldn't smoke weed and shit, huh
That I should cuss and shit, huh
That I shouldn't do the shit I wanna do
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I don't give a fuck about what these niggas think
That's they beliefs, here go mine

[Verse 3]
Now it's the shit, you wanna contest me
Never will you be the opponent left
Leave'em swept off they feet
So So Def got that chief shit, keep it brief
Under the covers ain't another bitch bad as me
So I must keep comin'
Keep on runnin' but you can't escape me
I'm in your brain
Remember the bitch you love to hate
She on the paper chase
In any case, but not any rate
Keep the currency's increase, shit ain't cheap
And my belief is to get the money, nigga
So what's the beef to this?
Enough cheese for Brat, never endin' G's
Hundred thousand dollar bills by the stack
The weak supportin' my habits
Enough karats for the whole salad
Smokin' cabbage every five minutes
Beginnin' my days rollin' swishes
I never listen to penny pinchin'
Pussy eatin' punks advice
To catch'em slippin' is my theory
Be weary what I bust, make niggas weak
And pack a bleeder, top notch in my speeches

[Chorus]
That I shouldn't smoke weed and shit, huh
That I should cuss and shit, huh
That I shouldn't do the shit I wanna do
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I don't give a fuck about what these niggas think
That's they beliefs, here go mine
