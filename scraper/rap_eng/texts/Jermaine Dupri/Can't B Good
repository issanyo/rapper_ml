[Intro]
I can't believe I let this happen to me
It always ends up not good
That's why I know this can't be good

[Verse 1]
Open my eyes, first thing I see
Your lovely smile smiling at me
Kiss my forehead, up out of bed
Off to start your day, here in bed I stay
Thinking 'bout last night, replaying in my mind
When you touch me there
Ooh, it feels so right
Then enter sins
What am I doin'?
Get up out of bed
To myself thinkin'

[Chorus]
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be what...oh...
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be what...oh...
This can't be good
Ooh...

[Verse 2]
What's going on? What's happening to me?
Promised myself I would never let this be
Never again (Never again)
Never that way (Never that way)
Cut me so deep that I haven't been the same
What I feel right now, I felt before
When I hear your name and my feelings are floored
I'll fight it if I can, but I don't know if I should
The one thing I know, this can't be good, babe

[Chorus]
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be what...oh...
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be what...oh...
This can't be good

[Bridge]
Oh, I thing I'm falling in love again (in love again)
Told myself I never would (Told myself I never would)
I think I'm falling in love again (in love again)
This cannot be good (Oh, this cannot be good, ooh)

[Chorus]
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be what...oh...
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be what...oh...
This can't be good
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be what...oh...
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be what...oh...
This can't be good

[Outro]
This can't be good
No, this can't be good
No, this can't be good
No, this can't be good
