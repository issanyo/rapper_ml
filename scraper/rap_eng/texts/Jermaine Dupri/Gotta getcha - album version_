I been watchin' you so damn long
But I don't know what to say or do
I be sittin' around fantasizin
Bout what I wanna do to you
It's something about the way you move
Your body, I can't take
Specially when you turn around
And you make you ass shake
You the number one most requested
In the club like one of my jams
But no matter what, when I come in
Youre right here where I am
Breakin it down like me in bed
Got a nigga spittin' up all his bread
Bendin over to the front
Lookin' back at me like what you want
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, some way
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, someway
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
I gotta getcha, I gotta getcha
And it don't matter if that's ya bitch wit ya
He's my man in 2 so let's switch up
And we be lookin' at each other, get the picture
And my body not Beyonce
But big girls we rollin' it down
Light skinned, used to be way in
But brown skin is the hot shit now
Don't tell me, yous a one hit wonder
Keep me hanging out on the shelf
You better act like I'm the real deal
And real bitches, I'm the last one left
Might never see me up in a thong
But I be rockin' my Adidas suit
Yo' chick can put a tight dress on
But she still won't look this cute
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, some way
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, someway
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
Shit if that's the case baby, what's it gon take
For us to get it jumped off right now
I got checkbooks, credit cards, all that shit
Just tell me how it's gotta go down
Now usually I ain't gotta trick but I will though
'Cause you, super bad and for real though
Ooh can't wait for my lips to kiss your lips, both sets
But you don't hear me though
Ooh yes, I wanna splurge with ya credit cards
Let me drive your cars all up and down the boulevard
Ain't feelin' talk playa, go and play ya part
Yeah, I like ya Southern draw, might let you hit it raw
Is you ready for don't stop get it charred
Down by all, take you to the titty bar
These chicks ain't shit, I mean none of y'all
Come up with it, get it, run up till this shit is on
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, some way
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, someway
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
I gots ta getcha, no matter what it takes
I gots ta getcha and I won't make no mistakes
Baby, I gots ta getcha like I told you before

I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha

If it's the last thing that I do
