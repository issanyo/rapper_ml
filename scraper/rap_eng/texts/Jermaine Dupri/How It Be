[Baby]
See the party won't start 'till I walk in
And I might start over with them Burberry tims
Me and J.D. with 'bout 10 of our friends
The Benz, the Lexus with the bubble eye lens
Bentley, coupes with the rag top vets
Brand new caddy with the jews and jets

[J.D.]
Throw up your sets up your bets
I'm the big check sign nigga rhyme nigga 24 I'm grindin'
Nigga hot boys since runnin' they was singin'
Here we go spendin' dough shit you ain't know
I works this pimp juice
Cash Money and So So Def all hell 'bout to break loose

[Chorus: TQ]
Every city town I go
Y'all know just how it be
When I come threw I shut it down
Cuz ain't no body bad like me
From the girls in the club that be shakin' they ass
To the way that we make your speakers blast
Last name Money first name is Cash
Y'all know y'all know just how it be

[Baby]
Big pimpin and hustlin we riding and dubbin'
When we walk threw the club all the hoes be huggin
More money more pain three colors on the range
We threw it out the roof screamin money ain't a thang
Visit JD get a boo and see it (holla)
We Gucci down from the head to the feet
The Cash Money model this nigga be greedy
And these horny hoes holla stunna please fini..

[J.D.]
I'm the loud over the top type
Never quiet when I come to your town I'm trying to start me a riot
Fuck your diet
Me and my niggas keep eating
Heating like DeNiro in the middle of the street and
I represent those that party all night
Shut down the club screamin green light
It's me and the Birdman ya heard
Please be clear It's so much stunnin going on in here

[Chorus] - repeat 4X
