[Chorus:]
We started as friends but now something's coming over me
See we got this strange kinda chemistry
I'm trying to ignore it but I just can't
I think I'm falling in love with you
Boy ain't that crazy
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Now that's crazy

[Verse 1:]
See our week started off like this
There was no movie that we didn't miss
There was no spot that we didn't hit
And every night with a goodnight kiss
Drop me off, hurry home in the car
Saturday was our day at the mall
I was the one that you told it all
That's why it's hard for me to believe that I'm starting to fall in love

[Pre-Chorus:]
So in love with you
And you know it's true
Do you feel the same way too

[Chorus:]
We started as friends but now something's coming over me
See we got this strange kinda chemistry
I'm trying to ignore it but I just can't
I think I'm falling in love with you
Boy ain't that crazy

[Rap:]
It's kinda hard for a guy and girl to be chillin'
Coz uh in the end one of the two is catchin' feelings
And I thought for sure that it wouldn't be me
But it is, now that's crazy

[Verse 2:]
I'm jealous when you and another girl speak
It's trippin' me out 'cause I'm in so deep
And I don't know why 'cause we used to be
Like sisters and brothers not lovers
Oh your plan didn't matter to me
We were having fun
I used to joke say you were the one
We laughed it off 'cause it sounded dumb
Never thought that there'd be a day when you'd hear me say
I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus:]
So in love with you
And you know it's true
I hope you feel the same way too-ooh-ooh

[Chorus:]
We started as friends but now something's coming over me
See we got this strange kinda chemistry
I'm trying to ignore it but I just can't
I think I'm falling in love with you
Boy ain't that crazy

[Rap:]
It's kinda hard for a guy and girl to be chillin'
Coz uh in the end one of the two is catchin' feelings
And I thought for sure that it wouldn't be me
But it is, now that's crazy

[Chorus:]
We started as friends but now something's coming over me
See we got this strange kinda chemistry
I'm trying to ignore it but I just can't
I think I'm falling in love with you
Boy ain't that crazy

[Rap:]
It's kinda hard for a guy and girl to be chillin'
Coz uh in the end one of the two is catchin' feelings
And I thought for sure that it wouldn't be me
But it is, now that's crazy

[Bridge:]
You know when I go, when I'm in or when
A 2003 version of my homie-lover-friend
Somebody I can talk to
When things don't feel right in the middle of the night
You are (the only person I wanna run to)
'Cause we party, we kick it, we play
We talk, we hug, we stay around each other everyday

[Chorus:]
We started as friends but now something's coming over me
See we got this strange kinda chemistry
I'm trying to ignore it but I just can't
I think I'm falling in love with you
Boy ain't that crazy

[Rap:]
It's kinda hard for a guy and girl to be chillin'
Coz uh in the end one of the two is catchin' feelings
And I thought for sure that it wouldn't be me
But it is, now that's crazy

[Chorus:]
We started as friends but now something's coming over me
See we got this strange kinda chemistry
I'm trying to ignore it but I just can't
I think I'm falling in love with you
Boy ain't that crazy

[Rap:]
It's kinda hard for a guy and girl to be chillin'
Coz uh in the end one of the two is catchin' feelings
And I thought for sure that it wouldn't be me
But it is, now that's crazy

Ain't that crazy
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Now that's crazy
