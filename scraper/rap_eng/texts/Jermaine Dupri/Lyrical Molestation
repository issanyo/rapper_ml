[Intro]
They call me Lethal Lip, The linguistic
Full metal jacket of vernacular ballistic
Shooting off at the mouth without chap or blistics
I got hairs on my funk and I didn't flunk diaper rash
I'm hooked on phonics packing a vicious vocabulary
Malicious with malice and mayhem straight out of a p-funk dictionary
Give me the mic and watch me slay them
Those lame illiterate poetic systems
Pisses me off
Should be missing me with that shit
Putting that petty poetry package pathetically in front of me
I suppress; I arrest the best of MCs regularly

[Verse 1]
In the beginning I was doubted
Slid in and rerouted
This shit to places y'all bitches weren't even thinking bout hittin'
Heads splittin', shittin' hard on niggas
With a name like Brat exotic cars and large bank figures
A high rank nigga
Top spot taker
Maker of some hot shit loose
Makin' it hard for all yall bitches to move around like moose
Bruise whateva touch come through in a clutch
Bitch beat me never heard of such
Niggas say I'm just too much
Consistent dollar clocker
Sipping lemonade and vodka
Private shopper live and die hip hopper
With the platinum touch
That's what the fuck up
And I ain't tryna lack and slack shit
I'm tryna pack and stack shit
To continue to make phat shit

[Chorus]
And niggas know..
The lyrical molestin is takin place
And when Da Brat is in your area your shit ain't safe
To live my whole life lavish I lust plus crushin'
Competitions a must everytime I bust
And niggas know..
The lyrical molestin is takin place
And when Da Brat is in your area your shit ain't safe
To live my whole life lavish I lust plus crushin'
Competitions a must everytime I bust

[Verse 2]
I'm livin' in high times with a lifeline when the sun don't shine often
Taught that the bare necessity was to never let no nigga see me soften
Coughin' up phlegm in the morning from choking on dank daily
Beware my attitude shady pay me and serenade this lady
Reached impossible limits no gimmick lyrics
Livin' trife and lavish Ms. Harris with 25 karats
To cherish the iced out ouster perpetual roll
The swish and burn it slow cats me know
Never fishin' for roaches or smokin' the hocus pocus
Once I was the brokest bitch now afford the dopest shit
The poker Chips get placed on the misses with twisted
Shoe here
Chi town's windy city creeper weed keeper
Redrumming niggas like the shining when the molestation begins

[Chorus]
And niggas know..
The lyrical molestin is takin place
And when Da Brat is in your area your shit ain't safe
To live my whole life lavish I lust plus crushin'
Competitions a must everytime I bust
And niggas know..
The lyrical molestin is takin place
And when Da Brat is in your area your shit ain't safe
To live my whole life lavish I lust plus crushin'
Competitions a must everytime I bust

[Verse 3]
If you consider yourself to be a competitor
The object of the game is to bury ya
Get the cheddar the mo' the merrier 3-1-2 the area
Prepare for my brigade to stay paid and obligated
To knock off niggas in ways you only saw take place in animation
Your expiration date is past due
We conjured up this shit to last you till infinity
Finna be multimillion in a minute
Only solo ho to do more than your average bitch
Making niggas sick and having fits watchin me push the Benz six
Admit it I'm da type to get addicted to like China
Watch you fucking wit pure dough
Tonight's da night we all get high
Niggas know Brat take without askin
Leaving everlasting gashes on you bastards
Lyrical assassin and niggas know

[Outro]
Therefore this rap rendition introdition of competition
Made some motherfucker before the first admission
Gets to a center mountain I sip the spout
Rhyming ad infinitum
I pee in the fountain then I claw
Clutching the cliff cuz I've got to get higher
Into the mantic with the mad messiah
GC's going crazy hacking the channel through all the slack rappers
I pack I pack a bag I travel
To the peninsula with the posse I peep over the edge
Drop a rock over your head as you leaving up the ledge to lead on
Leaving you mangled, tangled in your mic chord
Your momma would've been better in battle
Your boasting is bogus; silly posing
Putting your petty poetry package pathetically in front of me
I suppress; I arrest the best of MCs regularly
