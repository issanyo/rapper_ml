[Intro: JD talking]
What's up baby?
I know some days..I go without making you feel appreciated

(Im tryna set it out for my lady)
I know you know I love you but I wanna say it again
Let you know Im down with you girl til the end
But sometimes I feel you think I don't appreciate it
So every song that says "I love you" I wanna dedicate it to my..
