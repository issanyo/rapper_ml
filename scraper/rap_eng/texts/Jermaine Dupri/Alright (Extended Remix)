Just kick a little somethin' for them cars that be bumpin'
Somethin' real smooth
You can just ride to
Tell me how you feel
Here we go...
The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
Went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirts and khakis
Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac
See, the bell rang and I got my dash
Fellin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No moms trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac
I says "What I am is what I am is who I be"
And yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me
Cool, cause dissin' and no pay
They're the reason why we are who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Chris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's alright

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good
Little kids try to be like me with the braids, the shades, some pants
And some Nikes, G
And nithin' mo' better than a letter sayin'
"I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?"
Yesssss.....
I try to pass 'em my autograph
I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood
Ain't nobody dissin' and a nigga thinks he's too good
Cause I'm down like four flat tires
Just a little nappy headed kid from the proj
Showin' I can do right and not do wrong
Rappers and the Beejees comin' up strong
And we ain't got no love for the side
We only love those who love us back
Right?

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast
Cause I'm always on the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know
Really know
The pressure it is for some kids tryin to make it in this here biz
Early mornin' interviews then we step to school
Step from school
Back to interviews then it's on to other dues
So, warm it up Chris
I said "Ya warm it up Chris"
That's what I was born to do
Now throw your hands in the air and wave from side-to-side
If the feelin' thatcha feelin' is the feelin' of pride
See, I ain't come out wack I come out right
Unlike those 'mose who tried to pass the mike
It's the Daddy Mac
Big thing
Everything is real but you wanna dis cause a nigga sold a couple mill
Look here, ya can't say nothin' if ya last in a line
So when you dis it just lets me know I'm on your mind
And it's alright
