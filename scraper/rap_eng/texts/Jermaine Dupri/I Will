I will always love you
You were the first to take my heart
Make me happy, at the same time make me cry
Show me a lot of things I never knew that I had inside
Late night phone conversations of you
Telling me what you wanna do
Then we argue all night about who's been sleeping with you
No matter what people say
It don't change the way I feel
And no matter how much we fuss and fight
I got to keep it real with myself
Cause as bad as I wanna leave
It's the hardest thing for me
I can keep trying to act like I don't care
But deep down inside I ain't going nowhere
I will always love you
No matter how many things you try to do or say
Certain things just don't go away
I will always love you
No matter how many things you try to do or say
Certain things just don't go away
You were the first to see my body, body
Give me gifts and all types of real nice things
I used to tell you how much I loved you
And in return you would do the same
I've had so many lonely days
Ever since you upped and went away
I can't help but wonder where you're at
Hoping one day you'll be back, baby
No matter what people say
It don't change the way I feel
And no matter how much we fuss and fight
I got to keep it real with myself
Cause as bad as I wanna leave
It's the hardest thing for me
I can keep trying to act like I don't care
But deep down inside I ain't going nowhere
I will always love you
No matter how many things you try to do or say
Certain things just don't go away
I will always love you
No matter how many things you try to do or say
Certain things just don't go away
You know, baby, I love you
Respectfully, I say to thee
I'm aware that you're cheating
But no one, no one
Can make me feel the way you do
I will always love you
No matter how many things you try to do or say
Certain things just don't go away
I will always love you
No matter how many things you try to do or say
Certain things just don't go away
You know that
Cause you know that I'd rather have you, you
Cause you know that, cause you know that
