[Chorus: 2-Crucial]
I did this
You tried that
You copied me
That's my swag
That's my style give it back, Three words...
I SET TRENDS!
I got the swag, I got the swag, I got the swag (x2)
That's my style give it back, three words...
I SET TRENDS!

[Verse 1: Lil Poopy]
Before Matt Ryan came to ATL, he played for Boston and wore number 12
Now I'm out here in ATL, straight from Boston and I'm only 12
Ask Rozay if his home for sale
You know the one that he bought off Holy Fields?
I might buy that and a couple years and from now, up in the Hollywood Hills Hills, yeah!
I got the swag, I got the swag
Got me some dope today, I gotta bag
I got the Iverson braids, I got it drivin' today
Making sure I get high enough grades, always studying
I was up late, I was on stage, I was on the News, I was on the front page (Poopy!)

[Chorus 2-Crucial]
I did this
You tried that
You copied me
That's my swag
That's my style give it back, three words...
I SET TRENDS

[Verse 2: Young Lyric]
I got the swag and it's going up
We setting trends and they copy us
We coming up ain't no stopping us
I got em' dabbing and turning up
Whip so exotic, they know it's us
We showin' out when we showin' up
Winnin' cause they don't work hard as us
Dearly you ain't balling hard enough
Done with they trying
I'm real and they lying
My numbers the highest so you can't deny it
I jumped off the porch and said "Mama I'm flying"
And now I'm the flyest I want it, I buy it
Matter of time turn to Matter of Fact
My shoulders hurt cause the H on my back
I got the swag and they mad about that
Jackin' my style but I'm taking it back

[Chorus 2-Crucial]
I did this
You tried that
You copied me
That's my swag
That's my style give it back, three words...
I SET TRENDS!

[Verse 3: Lil Niqo]
They copied my swag and they still wack
No punchlines that's real facts
And word the Usher, called me and met
Only 16 and been overseas
We should start on the whip I don't need the keys
Kick it with your girl like I'm Bruce Lee
They huffing', they puffin', they talking bout' nothing
I hope that they know they ain't scaring me nah
Look in his face and I know he mad
'Cause I got the swag just peep my dab
Y'all taking shots and I'm throwing jabs
Y'all then got Dexter back in the lab
I maneuver through Uber don't need no cab
Verses on verses, that's stupid weapons
I'm the missile that can't be detected
I just hit them when its unexpected like... this

[Chorus 2-Crucial]
I did this
You tried that
You copied me
That's my swag
That's my style give it back, three words...
I SET TRENDS

[Verse 4: Supa Peach]
(Yeah!)
I got that swag that none of these jackers can touch, I'm like hammer
I'm trippin' for real, if I stay still, pull out the cameras
I'm flexin', I'm flexin', I'm reppin' my city whenever I'm steppin' in
I'm a trendsetter forever the "S" on my chest man she do it better than
Ahead of the curve they copy my words no time for these birds
Profiling my style you run by the mile
They jockin' I smile, Yeah
I be going in like it's a curfew
Don't be mad 'cause no one knows you
Catch me in the future you live in the past
And I'ma outgrow you (Supa!)

[Chorus 2-Crucial]
I did this
You tried that
You copied me
That's my swag
That's my style give it back, Three words...
I SET TRENDS

[Verse 5: Miss Mulatto]
(Hold up, Hold up)
That's my style, give it back
On top just like my hat
You a duck like quack quack
Spittin' like I gotta gap
Runnin' circles round em', I'm doing laps
I'm poppin just like my tag
They stealin' the swag so I switched it up and now I call it dab
Peter Piper i'm as hot as a pepper
No one do it better, all I write is checks
I ain't got no time to write love letters
I got the swag, I got the cash, I'm so addicted to fashion...
Hold up I set trends

[Chorus: 2-Crucial]
I did this
You tried that
You copied me
That's my swag
That's my style give it back, Three words...
I SET TRENDS
I got the Swag, i got the Swag, I got the Swag (x2)
That's my style give it back, three words...
I SET TRENDS!
