Now that you are here with me
Baby, lets do it right
Lady, you know just what I mean
I want to hold you, oh, so tight
Baby, just touch me anywhere, hey
This cutie, gets, turn me on, oh, baby
And I like to run my fingers through your hair
So come on and stay with me all night
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
I wanna roll wit'cha, lady
The feeling so strong
I wanna rock wit'cha, lady
All night long
Rock 'n' roll 'n' roll 'n' rock
Makin' sweet lovin', don't you ever stop
