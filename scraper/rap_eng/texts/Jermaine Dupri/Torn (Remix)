[Mike Jones]
A part of me wanna stay and chill
With you cause I feel it's real
But when you start trippin
I can't stay girl I'm out of here
See all that fussin up in my ear
Gone make me just disappear
Part of me wanna mess around
Part of me wanna keep it real
Part of me wanna hold you close
And love you from head to toe
Part of me wanna change my mind
Say fuck it just let it go
Cause all that trippin you doin
Is ruinin everything that I had in mind on pursuring
I need to get my mind straight so we stay separate
If so you can be replaced, if so you can be replaced
I need to get my mind straight so we stay separate
If so you can be replaced, if so you can be replaced
Holla!

[Letoya] (J.D.)
A part of me wants to leave you alone
A part of me wants for you to come home
A part of me says I'm livin a lie
And I'm better off without you (Cmon Toya)
A part of me says to think it through
A part of me says I'm over you
A part of me wants to say goodbye
A part of me is asking why
A part of me wants to leave
But a part of me wants to be here with you
And everytime I think that we're over and done
You do something that get me back lovin you (All the lady say)
And you got me just torn

1-  Torn in between the two
Cause I really wanna be with you
But something is telling me that I should leave
You alone, leave you alone, leave you alone
And you got me just torn in between the two
Cause I really wanna be with you
But something is telling me that I should leave
You alone, leave you alone, leave you alone

[Letoya]
What hurts the most is when we started out
It was cool it was everything that love's about
But something happened
Cause I'm feeling so burned out
Because I can't understand you now
I just can't understand you now
A part of me says it's all my fault
A part of me says it ain't what you want
A part of me says to get my bags
A part of me says I can't do that
A part of me wants to leave
But a part of me wants to be here with you
And everytime I think that it's over and done
You make me fall back in love
You got me just torn

Rick Ross..
I met her like a month ago, South Beach bungalow
We rollin in that white thang, I'm rolling up one of those
She lookin like my wife thang, boy I need one of those
Girl it's not a slice thang, ask bout me runnin ...
My heart in the trap, got my money on my mind
But when I got you in my lap, we be far from killing time
And they say that opposites attract, but we both on our grind
I love to touch you from the back, tell wassup and never mind
Ross...

How bad, tell me how bad do you want me?
Cause I dont know if I should stay or I should leave
How bad, tell me how bad do you want me?
