[Intro]
La-da-da-da-da
Your girlfriend

[Verse 1]
Maybe silly for me to feel this way about you and her
'Cause I know she's been such a good friend
I know she has helped you through

[Pre-Chorus]
Talking late on the phone
Every night you've been callin'
Private moments alone
Could your heart soon be fallin'
And I know she's a friend
But I can't shake the feeling
That I could be losing your heart

[Chorus]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

[Verse 2]
You said thats she's one who helped you see
How deep you're in love with me
And intentions were not to get in between
But I see possibilities

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that you feel
I'm the best thing in your life
And I know it's real, I see it in your eyes
There's no reason for me to even feel this way
I know you just enjoy her company

[Chorus]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

[Bridge: Jermaine Dupri & Alicia]
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
It's enough to make a (nigga) go crazy

[Chorus]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you
