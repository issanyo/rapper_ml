Yo, it's Xscape
For the nine five
And you know how they do
So lay back, kick it
And let's get live
Ladies, how often do you have
A man that makes you wanna cry
A man that makes you wanna laugh
Sisters, well I think I've found the one
That does everything I like
And knows how to get the job done
He makes me
Clap my hands, stomp my feet
Every little thing that you do to me
Feels so good, feels so good
Clap my hands, stomp my feet
Every little thing that you do to me
Feels so good, feels so good
Ladies, never have I felt this way before
He makes me feel so good and keeps me warm
He makes me feel so good
So good from my head to my toes
All the things that this man does
Everyone should know
And I don't ever wanna lose this feeling
His love is real, I'm willing to stay right by his side
'Cause I know he'll always be mine
The way he touch me makes me lose my control
And when you have a man like this
Love dictates your soul
He makes me
Clap my hands, stomp my feet
Every little thing that you do to me
Feels so good, feels so good
Clap my hands, stomp my feet
Every little thing that you do to me
Feels so good, feels so good
Clap my hands, stomp my feet
Every little thing that you do to me
Feels so good, feels so good
Clap my hands, stomp my feet
Every little thing that you do to me
Feels so good, feels so good
This is for those that like to pop the trunk and let it bump, b-bump
This is for those that like to pop the trunk and let it bump, b-bump
This is for those that like to pop the trunk and let it bump, b-bump
This is for those that like to pop the trunk and let it bump, b-bump
Clap my hands, stomp my feet
Every little thing that you do to me
Feels so good, feels so good
Clap my hands, stomp my feet
Every little thing that you do to me
Feels so good, feels so good
