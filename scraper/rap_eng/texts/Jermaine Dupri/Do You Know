Tosha, Candy, Tiny, Tameka you know the flames
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When I hear your voice
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When you come around
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When you touch me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When I look in your eyes
And you look into mine
Do you know what you do to me
Just when you think you know the game
It all comes to an end someday
'Cause everybody's got somebody
That moves built in someway
See I never thought I could happen to me
I couldn't see it until I met you
You set me free baby
When I hear your voice
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When you come around
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When you touch me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When I look in your eyes
And you look into mine
Do you know what you do to me
If this was a crush I would've been
Long over you but I know it's more
'Cause you got me doin' things I said I'd never do
My heart beeps beat beat
I lose my sleep gotta see you again
I'm doin' everything to let you know
I wanna be more than friends
When it comes to you I lose all my control
I let the situation get out of hand
Situation get out of hand
'Cause after life of playin' with you
Don't wanna be by myself
I can't seem to see you wit no one else
Baby, baby that's the kind of things you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When I hear your voice
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When you come around
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When you touch me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When I look in your eyes
And you look into mine
Do you know what you do to me
When I hear your voice
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When you come around
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When you touch me
Do you know what you do to me
Do you know what you do to me
When I look in your eyes
And you look into mine
Do you know what you do to me
