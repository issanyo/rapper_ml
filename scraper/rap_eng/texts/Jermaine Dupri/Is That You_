[JD]
You know how I do it
I try to rock ya all night, all night
You know how I do it
I try to rock ya all night, all night, come on

[Tamia]
1 - I'm looking for one
That can rock me from the night to the daylight
Ain't afraid to go and see what it tastes like
Keep it in the groove make it stay tight
Is that you?

I'm looking for one
That can rock me from the night to the daylight
Ain't afraid to go and see what it tastes like
Keep it in the groove make it stay tight
Is that you?

Is that you?
Not just my lover, my best friend
Down, down through thick and thin
With me though the very end
Is what I'm looking for
Somebody who understands it's all about me
Does everything in my dreams
Knows just what I need to make me happy
Could you be

Repeat 1

Is that you?
You've got to know what it means
When I say, do you love me?
And how much do you think of me
The hook up we've got going on on on
The most beautiful thing to me is to see
Two people in harmony
In love (In love)
I'm happy to let you know

Repeat 1

Is that you?
It's everybody's dream
To find the one that was made for them
Even though your chances are slim
You just gotta believe
And when it gets too hard
You can't fall apart
You gotta keep on keep on
Trying to get what you're looking for

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

Is that you?
