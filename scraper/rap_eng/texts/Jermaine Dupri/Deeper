All these raps, and no bodys rappin , obsessed with the same old lines,im power napping

I like to talk about something with real purpose , and bring the fire from inside to burn the surface
Forget all thoughts unique to the rap game, forget the luxuries forget the fortune the fame
Think deeper then your deepest thought, real meaning falls beneath the bs that you get taught
Let go of everything your Gonna be , guess im about to unleash, the inter me


My blue eyes have turned red from the evil that im seeing,im done takin anything from any human being
Standin up for anything that i believe in, deaf from all the screw yous and im leavin
Hers my middle finger stick it wherever you wanna, youll bow down to me no doubt but i ain't gonna
My thoughts are raising ghosts from way beyond the ghost of Motzart,deep within the ghost of rap itself is where my thoughts are
Using every word i can to tell a bit of real life, holdin on to every ounce of air im gonna ignite
I know you can rap alone looking in your little mirror , how about against a title wave, katrinas here
Step into my office you just got your first lesson,your the leftover and im...... the delicatessen
