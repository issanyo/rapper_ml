In the game of love
Its bitter and its sweet
And you wonder how something so beautiful
Can bring such agony
Let me tell you how it happened, to me

Just reminiscing on the way I used to dream
Prince Charming slay the dragon and come and rescue me
So many things have changed
But heartbreak feels the same
Well my strength is what I found
In the eye of a hurricane

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
So if the one I love
Never gave me love in return
Love's still alright with me
Still alright with me

Be still my heart
No one said there'll be days like this
Well I made it this far
I see where the end is gon' be
I said Chante, honey gotta keep pressing on
My peace I found in the eye of a hurricane

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
So if the one I love
Never gave me love in return
Love's still alright with me
Still alright with me

We're supposed to love unselfishly
But somehow I find I'm crying myself to sleep, sometimes
Tell me whose at fault at taking care of me
It's me, myself and my heart and I
Somehow we find a way to try to love again
Yet when you lose you tried
But still you're playing a game, well
Just when you learn the rules
You learn the rules have changed
I'm never worried cause I know just who I am
When you live, you learn to be the same
Even without the name

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
So if the one I love
Never gave me love in return
Love's still alright with me
Still alright with me

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
So if the one I love
Never gave me love in return
Love's still alright with me
Still alright with me

Love is still alright, alright, alright with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright
Love's still alright with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Choir continues to sing in background)

If the sun don't shine
There's still a little light in my heart
And if the rain falls done
I can still look at love
So if the one I love
Never gives me love in return
Love's still alright

Love is alright
Love is alright
Love is alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh love is alright

If the sun don't shine
There's still a little light in my heart
And if the rain falls done
I can still look at love
So if the one I love
Never gives me love in return
Love's still alright
