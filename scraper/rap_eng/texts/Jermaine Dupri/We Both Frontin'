And I'd die for my niggas, but never no hoe
So you know that the life I lead is twice your speed
A brown skin mami, that's the wife I need (uh huh)
Light that weed, front, nigga might just bleed
I might just squeeze, matter of fact I might just leave
Cuz I don't need a hoe that drink Moet by the liter
