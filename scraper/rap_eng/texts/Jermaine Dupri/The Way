[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri]
This is the time where you all should report to the dance floor
112 So So Def
Stop, wait a minute hold up love
J.D. plus 112 add that up
Now that equals me seeing you in see through
Now whatever the chain go I let the bottle of three do
Jeans by E Vesal check out the Vs too
A roof free coup do you like what you see boo (You like what you see)
2324059, left a cold tip behind
Shawty think she a dime
Me on her mind, sure to be some sexing
Going on talking reckless on the phone
She be naked waiting home
Soon as I undress it's on
She be screaming Jermaine till six in the morning

[Verse 2]
Girl I need to see you right away, there's somethin' one my mind about you
And I that I gotta say oh baby
Lately we been talking on the two way, about what you like
About what I like, and I think it's about time
We do something about it at home

[Bridge]
It's been so long since you had a man in your life
And weather you know it or not you need someone
To touch that spot that you love, and baby I'm willing
To give you what you've been missing
Don't tell my girl
Don't tell my girl about it
What I need to know is

[Hook]
Do you want me in the way
The way that I want you
The way that I want you
Baby I want you
Would you freak me
Would you freak me in the way
The way that I freak you
The way that I freak you
Baby I freak you
Would you let me

[Verse 3]
I used to want you so bad years ago
Now the feeling's come back
Baby infact it's a little bit stronger than before
Cause he had ya baby
Don't say no baby
Just let me have my way with you

[Bridge]
It's been so long since you had a man in your life
And weather you know it or not you need someone
To touch that spot that you love, and baby I'm willing
To give you what you've been missing
Don't tell my girl
Don't tell my girl about it
What I need to know is

[Hook] (x2)
Do you want me in the way
The way that I want you
The way that I want you
Baby I want you
Would you freak me
Would you freak me in the way
The way that I freak you
The way that I freak you
Baby I freak you
Would you let me

[Till fade]
Get your freak on
