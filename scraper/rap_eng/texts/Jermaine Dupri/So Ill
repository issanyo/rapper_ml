[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, Ted
Me and shawty, we just got ill ass connection, man
You now what I'm saying? Like...
We don't even be talking all the time and shit
But then we hook up
Seems like we be talking all the time and shit, you know?
Shit's crazy, you know what I mean? So ill
Brandon, explain what I'm saying to the people, man
Come on

[Verse 1: Brandon Hines]
Girl, the way you looking at me
Like I got what you need
I can feel you
All over my body
Your arms wrapped around me
You feel it, too
Now, every time we catch eyes
The hair on my body rise
Like a puppet
I'm under your control
Swear you won't let me go

[Chorus: Brandon Hines]
It's so, it's so ill, our connection
It's so, it's so ill, our connection
When I be talking to you, it makes me wanna see you
Not now, but right now, it's crazy, baby
It's so, it's so ill, our connection
It's so, it's so ill, our connection
But when we do hook up, sparks jump off
Things get felt that I never felt with nobody
Nobody else
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you be making me feel
Nobody
Nobody else
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you be making me feel

[Verse 2: Dondria]
You finish my sentences
Boy, you got my senses
All out of wack
Why you do me like that?
I'm like a kid again
You got it, daddy
Sometimes I imagine
I can see the image
Of you and me
In a place with no boundaries
Let your loving surround me

[Chorus: Brandon Hines]
It's so, it's so ill, our connection
It's so, it's so ill, our connection
When I be talking to you, it makes me wanna see you
Not now, but right now, it's crazy, baby
It's so, it's so ill, our connection
It's so, it's so ill, our connection
But when we do hook up, sparks jump off
Things get felt that I never felt with nobody
Nobody else
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you be making me feel
Nobody
Nobody else
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you be making me feel

[Bridge: Brandon Hines & Dondria]
Baby, hold me
Don't let go, let me know
Let you want me
Like I want you, too
Baby, show me
That you need it, the way that I need it
I'm connected to you

[Chorus: Brandon Hines, Dondria & Both]
It's so, it's so ill, our connection (so ill)
It's so, it's so ill, our connection (so ill)
When I be talking to you, it makes me wanna see you
Not now, but right now, it's crazy, baby
It's so, it's so ill, our connection (crazy, baby)
It's so, it's so ill, our connection (connection)
But when we do hook up, sparks jump off
Things get felt that I never felt with nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody has ever made me feel the way that you be making me feel
Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody has ever made me feel the way that you be making me feel

[Outro: Brandon Hines & Jermaine Dupri
Y'all know what this is!
Feel good
