[JD]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeahhhhhh

[Shade Sheist]
Yo, So So Def

[JD]
I ain't even got it say it

[Shade Sheist]
Baby Ree

[JD]
Y'all know

[Shade Sheist]
Shade Sheist

[JD]
Come on

[Chorus: Shade Sheist & JD]
Get your head out your ass playboy (playboy)
Get your head out your ass playboy
Stop holding your nuts
Get hot and make bread playboy
Cuz that's what we all live for
All you tricks with no job
Better do somethin' fast (fast)
Get your head out your ass (Trip)
Stop runnin' your mouth
Get hot and make bread (Why?)
Cuz that's what this shit is all about

[Shade Sheist]
When a hot shot nigga
When it comes to dope
Or when it's big face tonight
Yo it's all there though
Don't fumble with my funds
But I go with my guns
Ain't no shakin' ass hands
Just clap 'til I'm done
And Us Cali Ass Niggas
Just wanna have fun (Yeah!)
And freeze up with mo' ice than poliricians
Cool up and whips that need back from a loan
And hit clubs wit' hoes
All heavy on my arm
I represent the fine bitch pickas
So peep all T-L-C (Yeah!) types freaks
Back on the creep 'til my spot in the middle wit' nowhere
And easy game ova there
Or get 'em mad easy on their underwear
I'm not your average age nigga
In fact I'm just a underage nigga
Rollin' dirty wit' some major figgas (Yeah!)
But if you wanna test the warders
And see which motha fucka hits the hardest
Than won't we get the ninjas lord

Chorus
[Shade Sheist & JD]
Get your head out your ass playboy (playboy)
Get your head out your ass playboy
Stop holding your nuts (Yeahhhhhh)
Get hot and make bread playboy
Cuz that's what we all live for (You Heard?)
All you tricks with no job
Better do somethin' fast (fast)
Get your head out your ass
Stop runnin' your mouth
Get hot and make bread (Why?)
Cuz that's what this shit is all about (Tell 'em)

[Shade Sheist]
Yo I'm leavin y'all stuck in the game
Fucked in the brain (Uhhh)
Mocked around fussin for fame
Pourned in the chains
Most MC's retire like sport leagues
Bad Baseball careers are hit and missed
That's why I turned from the big
And I couped that six
Got the money that I saved
And invest that shit (Tell 'em)
While y'all niggas doing dirt
Yo I'm clean writing rhymes
In the tub wit' some for-fee hands on my spine
Wined and dinned
What's the rich niggas deal
Ain't the way to a tip
They cost more than a meal
Try to swing me a crib
That cost more than a mill'
Wit' this lyrics that you do
More then just fill
And Shade ain't the one that'll pay for your phone (No!)
But Shade be the one that'll buy you a home (Yeah)
And chip up your palms
'til your scar for life
And I decide that you're done
Cuz I need a new wife

[Chorus: Shade Sheist & JD]
Get your head out your ass playboy (playboy)
Get your head out your ass playboy
Stop holding your nuts
(Stop holding your nuts)
Get hot and make bread playboy
Cuz that's what we all live for (All live for)
All you tricks with no job
Better do somethin' fast (Do somethin' fast)
Get your head out your ass (ahh, we ain't playin')
Stop runnin' your mouth
Get hot and make bread (Why?)
Cuz that's what this shit is all about (Come on)

[Shade Sheist]
It took a nigga nine years
And a trip to G-A
Ought to leave you immature left wit' nothing to say
And after all this I guess I did come a long way
WHAT YOU EXPECT?
That I wouldn't make some hits today
Nah nigga
Cuz shade is the model for y'all niggas
Remember I'm So So Def too nigga (Yeahhhh)
It's gonna take a world wide poles
For me to frost
Shade and JD
We add another plaque for the wall (Bit-ch)

[Chorus: Shade Sheist & JD]
Get your head out your ass playboy (playboy)
Get your head out your ass playboy
Stop holding your nuts
Get hot and make bread playboy
Cuz that's what we all live for (You know)
All you tricks with no job
Better do somethin' fast (Do it fast)
Get your head out your ass (Stop playin' man)
Stop runnin' your mouth
Get hot and make bread (Why?)
Cuz that's what this shit is all about (Tell 'em)
Get your head out your ass playboy (playboy)
Get your head out your ass playboy
Stop holding your nuts
Get hot and make bread playboy (Yeah)
Cuz that's what we all live for (That's what we all live for)
All you tricks with no job
Better do somethin' fast (Yeah)
Get your head out your ass
Stop runnin' your mouth (Defenition)
Get hot and make bread (Stop playin' babe)
Cuz that's what this shit is all about
(Yeah!)
