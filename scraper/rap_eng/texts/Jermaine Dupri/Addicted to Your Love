[Intro]
Mic check, one to get ready uhm

I'ma get you sweaty and JE they gon' give you some
I'ma get you sweaty and JE they gon' give you some
I'ma get you sweaty and JE they gon' give you some

[Verse 1]
I tried to let you go so many times, yes I have
And I never thought that going back would never cross my mind
See I find it's only you that can give me that special treatment
I ain't never been wanting to beg
Baby I miss you and baby I need you

[Chorus]
You know I like the way you make me feel inside
Baby I just can't shake ya, I'm addicted to your love, baby
All day, all night you make me feel so right
Baby I just can't shake ya, I'm addicted to your love, baby

[Verse 2]
The thought of you makes me go crazy and I know
If you trust me you could be my one and only lady
And you make me feel how I wanna feel
Taking your time, let me know what's real
You know that I feel so right so give me what you got tonight
Lady when I close my eyes all I see is you
And all the beautiful things that we used to do
Lady when I close my eyes
It's only you I think of cuz I'm addicted to your love

[Chorus]
You know I like the way you make me feel inside
Baby I just can't shake ya, I'm addicted to your love, baby
All day, all night you make me feel so right
Baby I just can't shake ya, I'm addicted to your love, baby
You know I like the way you make me feel inside
Baby I just can't shake ya, I'm addicted to your love, baby
All day, all night you make me feel so right
Baby I just can't shake ya, I'm addicted to your love, baby
