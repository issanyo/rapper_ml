Till I die, this shit is crazy black
As a tar,i rock em bitch ass niggas
But I stay far, pretty bitches never give
A head, pointing fingers when you got
A fail,take a look at'cho fuckin blame
I ain't braggin bout where I stay, how I
Pay, what I wear,i hit the studio with a
Stay scheming beat, ricky rozay,drizzy drake,
Make it rain on ma hommies with a two oceans
On ma left hand, and a hennessy on ma right hand,
Like this shit is playin on ma band, when I got a
Twenty stacks I got hit a friend courtesy of the
Realest niggas geting paid, a dizzy motherfucker but
I keep it real when I skate, diss a nigga up thats a
Beef its just a nigga say,this'shit crazy more money more
Problems, no biggie, I better get this dirty money like
A Diddy, Treezy S that nigga silly I played by the rule
Sooner or later got a Maserati on ma feet, I bet'chu u
Can't handle thats ma heat, turn around and take a seat

The bank I ma take you to the rain when it rains
