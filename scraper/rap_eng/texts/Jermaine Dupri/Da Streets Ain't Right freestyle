(Notorious B.I.G.) Intro: (0:00:01 – 0:00:11) (Twice)
It's the ones that smoke blunts wit cha
See ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get cha

Chorus: (0:00:12 – 0:00:22)
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act

(Poncho) Verse 1: (0:00:22 – 0:01:07)
Well it's one day and we sitten here chillen in the dorm room with friends and family; getting ready to have a party, then we go out to get some powerrade; when all a sudden we get confronted by three people with baseball bats and guns; with the AK 37 and the AK 47 they ready to tear and blow our heads off. When a security guard stops the action he says just wait hold on one minute; if you all don't stop this mess; I'm gonna have to dish you just like the rest and I'm about to beat you all up so bad; so get back into the line and I”ll put you back on the timeline, because that's how I roll and I just crossed the line

Chorus: (0:01:08 – 0:01:29) (Twice)
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act

(James) Verse 2: (0:01:29 – 0:02:14)
Well first of all let me just explain myself; I'm detective and special agent James Flemington. I own the detectives and agents in the world, because that's how I play the game. I own the cops in the blue, because I can and baby that's how I rule. That's how I role, that's how I go; so guess what you just like. Like “Fools Gold” just like Andy Mineo and Lecrae (christians rappers there are really great), but I'm the detective and special agent just like Law and Order SVU. I own the people in CSI, CSI Miami, and Criminal Minds; if you don't believe just ask myself and I will tell that I'm special agent James Flemington

Chorus: (0:02:15 – 0:02:36) (Twice)
Niggas in da street ain't right

(Twan) Verse 3: (0:02:36 – 0:03:21)
Dont know what they talking  bout, but Ima speak that real
Cuz if yall talkin guns, Im coming with that steel
If they coming with guns, they better aim to kill
Cuz if they dont, Im Jaden's father cuz I Will
I heard they coming for Ponch with ak's
My squad got extendos, we can shoot for days
They better not come for me when Im on that purple haze
Leave they whole team red like its a fashion craze
Then I'll run up on yo crib, shoot everybody, then its deuces
Headshots only, that vest is so useless
Got yo name on the bullet, I bet you feel exclusive
Think you can mess with me? Nah thats foolish
I know the streets ain't right cuz Im in them every night
Violence and hatred is all in my sight
Me and poncho gotta struggle to keep our lives
However we stay strapped so we'll be alright

Chorus: (0:03:21 – 0:03:43) (Twice)
Niggas in da street ain't right
Every other day I keep strugglin' to keep my life
And I never know when I gotta go, so I stay strapped
Cause niggas they don't know how to act
