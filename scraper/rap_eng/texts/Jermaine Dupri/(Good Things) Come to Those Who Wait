[Intro]
Good things come to those that wait
Good things come to those that wait
(Rock that shit!)
Good things come to those that wait
Good things come to those that wait
(Rock that shit!)

[Verse 1: Batman]
Someday I'll see the fruit of my favors
I'll have a piece of the pie
I'm always doing everyone a favor
When will the part be mine?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Try and try,  harder work, the words of my mama
From the day that I begin
She said, "Keep the faith and don't let nothing get away
And baby, you'll get close in the end"

[Chorus]
Good things come to those that wait
Good things come to those that wait (rock that shit!)
(Good things come to those that wait)
And if you think that it's impossible
I got something you should know
Good things come to those that wait
That's what somebody told me

[Verse 2: Batman]
I know it's just a matter of time
I'll wait for my big day
I asked the one above and he told me
It comes to those who wait

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Try and try, harder work, the words of my mama
From the day that I begin
She said, "Keep the faith and don't let no one in your way
And baby, you'll get close in the end"

[Chorus (2x)]
Good things come to those that wait
Good things come to those that wait (rock that shit!)
(Good things come to those that wait)
And if you think that it's impossible
I got something you should know
Good things come to those that wait
That's what somebody told me

Rock that shit!
Rock that shit!

[Chorus (2x)]
Good things come to those that wait
Good things come to those that wait (rock that shit!)
(Good things come to those that wait)
And if you think that it's impossible
I got something you should know
Good things come to those that wait
That's what somebody told me

[Outro]
Rock that shit!
That's what somebody told me
