[Intro]
Hah, ha, ha, ha (T-L-C)

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whooa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa (oww!)
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
And I believe it don't affect nobody else but me

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Ya'll been telling me what to do
Since I was old enough to walk
Old enough to talk
Never let me speak or move
Do my own thang

But now I'm growin' wiser now
Brighter now
A little bit tighter now
And ya'll can't hold me down
I know you hate to hear
But things have changed in

1 - My life
It's kinda wild but, me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they momma tryin' do it
My life
I've done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me

[T-Boz]
Getting sick and tired of folks who wanna come around
Claim they gon' get down but all they wanna do is
See me make a wrong move, yeah

I don't care what you hear in the news
Or see who I choose to do the late night creep with
I'm gonna do just what I wanna do
It's my life

Repeat 1

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whooa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
And I believe it don't affect nobody else but me

[Chilli]
Sometimes I might get a little crazy
And sometimes I might seem out of hand
But I'm sayin' life's too short for me to let you dictate
What I say and the moves I make
Sick of people tryin' tell me what to do
It's my life and I'mma live it like I want to

[Left Eye]
Check it
Another day another dollar
Is the reality of my mentality
Otherwise don't even botha
You see my father was a wise old man
Always creatin a plan for me to conquer this land
He said I am what I am
So be the best that I can
And if them others don't like it
Then why should I give a damn (huh)
Maybe so cause when his life wasn't right
My mother picked up them pieces
And continued on with the fight
So now it's plain to me
It ain't no game to me
See mom and dad corrected math, 1 and 1 equal 3
4 and 5 I count my sister and brother
Stay alive till we die
And don't you ever be worried
Cause I'm down with a ride
Through peaks and valleys, to the Cresent Hills
Tumble down, I'll set a new ground for Jack and Jill's
Ever wonder what put the thunder deeply in my eyes
Take a look and you'll find the sunshine

My life, my life, my life

Repeat 1
