[Intro: Jermaine Durpi]
This...is...So So...Def
My man Anthony Hamilton
And I went out and got somebody
They're gonna tell you a little bit about where they come from

[Verse 1: Scarface + (J.D. ad-libs)]
They got me trapped in the belly of this beast once again
And this say this time I'm looking at at least 2 to 10
Went from a nigga ballin', blowin' Sweets, pourin' Henn
To a nigga 'bout to catch the chain, headed to the pen
My friend, made a bond and left me there to rot
But I swear to God that I'm gon' get his ass if I get out (That's right)
Conspiracy to get a nigga jammed, that's the plot
Get everybody caught off in your scam and rat 'em out
(Ant, sing to 'em)

[Verse 2: Anthony Hamilton]
Sittin here, guess I didn't make bail
Got time and a story to tell (Come on)
Started when I was nine years old
Woke up and daddy was gone
I started hustlin', they couldn't tell me nothin' (Nah)
Frontin' in the hood tryin' to be somebody
My soul was on empty
I was searching for something
(What you try to do?)

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Tried to be good; tried to keep from trouble (Yeah-ye-yeah)
Livin' too fast; tryin' to make good on a hustle
(It's hard sometimes)

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Sometimes it gets rough
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Times got hard, yeah
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta walk to work, yeah
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta do a little dirt
Comin' from where I'm from I'm from
(Give 'em some more)

[Verse 3: Anthony Hamilton]
Wasn't really lookin', guess I found it
Five-foot-three, light brown skin (Little fine something)
Comin' from the university
Nice style, lookin' kinda lovely
Didn't know she had much game (A lot)
Down to ride out, even take the train
Even took her to a poker game
Top notch from fried chicken to sushi

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Tried to be good (Yeah, you tried?) [I tried]
Tried to treat you like a lady
Tried to be a friend, turned out that you were shady
(That's how it goes sometimes)

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Sometimes it gets lonely
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Thangs ain't what they seem to be
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you get a little angry, yeah
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you get the best of me
(Y'all know me; this the part I like right here
Let's take 'em to the bridge)

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
Well, tried to be good [I tried]
Wanted nothing but to love somebody
Didn't wanna die young
Steady hustlin' tryin' to feed my family
Too scared to have kids, and do like daddy did
'Cause I'm so scared of failin'
Sometimes it gets hard
Comin' from where I'm from
(Yo Face, tell 'em how the rest of the story go)

[Verse 4: Scarface]
My baby mama gon' go back to school in the fall
I think she's got another dude 'cause she won't take my calls
Public defender got papers he want me to sign
Cop me out to a lesser charge, minimize my time
But I'm, taking shit to trial, win or lose
When you're locked down and your back's against the wall, what you do?
You move; you face the rainy day to see the sun
You play the odds 'cause bet it pays, you bet it 3-to-1

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Comin' from where I'm, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta moan
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta cry a little bit louder
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta fight the pain
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you gotta walk alone
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you get a little worried
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes you get lost outta touch
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes I think I pray a little bit too much
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes I get a little scared
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Sometimes I get a little scared
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from...
