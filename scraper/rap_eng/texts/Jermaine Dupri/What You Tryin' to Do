[Intro]
What ya trying to do for it?

[Verse 1]
Is it real enough for you to take a cab or a bus
Tryna get to where I'm at 'cause you lust for me
We end up making love, tell me what'cha wanna do
I just wanna be the one u come and give all your love
Make a nigga take all your love
Wanna show you things, give you things
It's all on you, you, you
If I could just have a minute
Baby come and take a ride with me
Baby won't you spend your life with me
All I want is you, you, you
I know you're right for me
Girl you're everything I think I need

[Chorus]
Said it's only right when you feel like you're lonely
That you get at me
I got the kind of love you don't get tired of
And I put that there on everything(put it on everything)
Baby what'cha trying to do for it
Heard that you been looking for
Good love,and I'm not for sure
That I know just what'cha came here for
What'cha trying to do for it
I'll spend all my loot for it
Tell me what'cha wanna do
What what'cha gonna to do?
What'cha trying to do for it
Heard that you been looking for
Good love and Im not for sure
That I know just what'cha came here for
What you trying to do for it
I'll spend all my loot for it
Tell me baby what'cha trying to do
What'cha trying to do for me baby

[Verse 2]
I can prove it if you wanna
We can run it, cause I gotta enough
You can get all my love
Baby I give up, don't ya know what you really came here for
If you're think that you can be the woman who really got love for me
You feeling like you gotta be
Let me know that you like my flow
We can go, how you wanna go
Now that I have a minute
Let me tell you that you're beautiful
And baby that I love you so
That's how the story goes
And now I see that your love is always on time
Baby I know that you

[Chorus]
Said it's only right when you feel like you're lonely
That you get at me
I got the kind of love you don't get tired of
And I put that there on everything(put it on everything)
Baby what'cha trying to do for it
Heard that you been looking for
Good love,and I'm not for sure
That I know just what'cha came here for
What'cha trying to do for it
I'll spend all my loot for it
Tell me what'cha wanna do
What what'cha gonna to do?
What'cha trying to do for it
Heard that you been looking for
Good love and Im not for sure
That I know just what'cha came here for
What you trying to do for it
