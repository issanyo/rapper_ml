[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo!
I'm sick of this, man
I can't even take no more
'Cause I hate the fact that I love you so much
And you know what I'm saying?
You don't even understand what this is doing to me
Every time I try to get away, I just can't let you go
You know what I'm saying?
I just can't let you go!

[Verse 1: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
I never ever wanna hurt you, I just wanna love ya
I just wanna sex you up
I wanna give you everything you need, -thing you want
Just lay down and let me love you all night long
It was beautiful when we first started
I don't wanna leave you, I just wanna keep you
When they saw me, they saw you
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl
That's how I felt
Every time I thought it was right, it went left

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue (what happened to all the good times?!)
I tell myself that I don't want you no more (girl)
But I can't let you go (you see, I can't let you go!)
So much love and hurt and hate (I hate this!)
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave (see what I'm saying?!]
But I can't let you go

[Break: Jermaine Dupri]
Now you wanna be real insensitive and try to act kinda funny, man
You know what, man?!
You ain't even gotta wait till in the morning, man
You can get out of here tonight, man
Hey, yo, Glen, come grab her shit and get her out of here!

[Verse 2: Usher]
Baby, you ain't even gotta like me, but you're not gonna fight me
You can't walk away and say
I never gave you everything want, -thing ya need
All we ever do is argue all night long
I don't wanna leave you
See you with another brother loving you
Saying "damn the world, it's me and my girl"
That's how I feel when you think everything is real
But it really ain't

[Chorus: Usher]
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go

[Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri]
Got me walking around, ready to snap
Got me walking around, looking for somebody to slap
Got me going, going with no pause
Got me up in Cartier everyday just 'cause
Got me arguing about little stuff she don't call little stuff
It get a little rough, then we kiss and make up
She wanna say what she wanna, I don't play that
She wanna constantly bring up shit from way back
Got me thinking about her while I'm watching a flick
Got me dipping through traffic, trying to get home quick
Got me talking to myself, I'm hating this
Got me wanting to wild out like I'm Jadakiss
Got me in a place I never thought I would see
Got me not wanting to stay, not wanting to leave
Got me happy, got me confused
Got me wishing I could get it how I used to

[Chorus: Usher]
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go
