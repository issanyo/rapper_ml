[Verse 1: Jussie Smollett & Mariah Carey]
To live for things impossible
Come dream, my cup, it overflows
Right now we face the sunrise of love, mmm
Your body closes in on mine
Wishes break in, and justified
Sweet hurricane of love flowing with the tide

[Chorus: Jussie Smollett & Mariah Carey]
Now say you mean, the world to me
Say what you are, it’s infamous
It’s such a rush, reality
I’m so into you the things you do
I know it’s dangerous, but I believe
A greater love, there’ll never be
I’m hoping, boy, so turn and see
Carry on and on and rock with me
Love is a sport and we’re infamous

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey & Jussie Smollett]
Rise up, this moment’s drizzling, boy
Face time, come back to play and enjoy
My champion, your will always saves the day
Ready to stop and start again
Return to blissful innocence
Go past the places I've never shown
She’s cast alone

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I said you mean, the world to me
Say what you are, it’s infamous
It’s such a rush, reality
I’m so into you the things you do
I know it’s dangerous, but I believe
A greater love, there’ll never be
I’m hoping, boy, so turn and see
Carry on and on and rock with me
Love is a sport and we’re infamous

[Verse 3: Jussie Smollett]
Okay, we both know the reputation, been around since day one
Baby my A-1, know we have our little days
But hey, ain’t nothing like our creation
Carry on and on and rock with me, long as we’re rolling, it’s infamous
I call you bae, so you know that mean, it ain’t my last temptation
I know that my feelings is clouded, but baby, we can’t live without it
Love no game, oh
Carry on and on and rock with me, long as we rolling, it’s infamous

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Jussie Smollett]
Now say you mean the world to me
Say what you are, it’s infamous
It’s such a rush, reality
I’m so into you, the things you do
I know it’s dangerous, but I believe
A greater love, there’ll never be
I’m hoping, boy, so time to see
Carry on and on and rock with me
Long as it’s glowing as long as this moment
We’re infamous
