I finally figured out why i'm always on guard when you're around
I'm feeling so uncertain bout do you really want me or what i got?
I really hope it's not
But i wonder why if i ain't taking you out somewhere nice you ain't even tryna come on by and just say hi
We can stay in the house for a quiet night tonight
I'm tryna tryna tryna...Tryna let you know baby but i can't make it that easy
A girl gotta have a little game too
You should know that's it's all about yo
I'm having visions of this girl like a warning
I'm waking up like six in the morning
Feeling like it really ain't healthy
Do she wanna be with me? I need to know
Visions of this girl like a warning
I'm waking up like six in the morning
Feeling like it really ain't healthy
Do she wanna be with me?
Think i'm sweating now just tryna figure out if you're the one
Wish you'd give me a clue about what you're about
Let's have it out i'm going down
Hope you think of me and if you really don't then let it be
Cuz i can't be nobody's charity it's real love for me entirely and completely
I need to know....
Having visions of this girl and
Ooohhh
Could this be my warning?
Ooohhh
Having visions of this girl and
I don't know
If maybe this is my warning, warning, warning, warning
