[Verse 1]
I bet the women always wonder how I keep a man
They been trying for so long, and still don't understand
It's not the things I say, it's the way I say it
That keeps them locked down, nowhere to go
And on top of that, I let him know

[Chorus]
I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act
You never have to worry 'bout a thing, I gotcha' back
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
'Cause it feels real good
When you know somebody's got ya' back

[Verse 2]
I'm the type when I find a man I like
It's on and poppin', ain't no stoppin', the things I do for you
No complications, baby keep it real
Do unto to me, as I do, and everything will be cool
When you find yourself in times of trouble
Remember that I'm by your side (I'm by your side)
Lean on me, when you're not strong
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on

[Chorus]
I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act
You never have to worry 'bout a thing, I gotcha' back
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
Because it feels real good
When you know somebody's gotcha' back

I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act
You never have to worry 'bout a thing, I gotcha' back
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
'Cause it feels real good
When you know somebody's gotcha' back
