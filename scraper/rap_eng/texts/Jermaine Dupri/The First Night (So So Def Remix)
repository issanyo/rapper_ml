Baby, baby tell me what's up
Can you hear me, hear me
Or do I need to turn it up
Baby, baby tell me what's up
Can you hear me, hear me
Or do I need to turn it up, huh
So So Def

[Monica]
I should, I should make a move but I won't (c'mon)
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong (it's the remix)
Knowing that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night (c'mon)

It's Saturday night, feeling kinda right
I wanna get close to you, and let you call me your baby
I know it ain't right, it's just the first night
I couldn't keep lookin' and it's driving me crazy
I know it was wrong for feeling this way
The thought of getting it on the first date
Couldn't let go it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinking

[Chorus]
I should, I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
I should, I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

You're telling me yes, putting me to the test
Don't know how much longer I can keep my composure
Trying my best to deal with all of this
But at the same time I can feel us getting closer
Felt so right but it felt so wrong
And look how you're carrying on
Trying to say things to get me to stay
But my watch is telling me it's getting too late
I'm thinking

[Chorus]

[JD]
Shhh, check this out
Tonight, lil' kiss, touch, we ain't gotta do all of that stuff
I'm just sittin' here tryin' to chill with you, we ain't gotta rush
I just wanna ball with you, in and out the mall with you
Out of town on the phone, all night call with you
Chi-Chi, baby, I do all my shit correct
Just you and me, just lay, you ain't suppose to be ready yet
Cuz you don't know if I want just sex and I don't know if you want my check
Even though you probably just expecting me to be kissin' on your neck
Now baby

[ROC]
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
I see you get hot and I know it's time
At 69 we could draw the line
I know you could give me yours
And I owe you mine
When I meet the girl, I creep the girl
I freak the girl, I please the girl
If you need the girl, man, keep the girl
Let the whole Roc gon' see the girl
If I should, I should make a move
Make it smooth, take it to that crib
Let that player lazy groove
Make her ahh, make her ooh
Cuz money come, money go
So So, honey dough, love it when they go how low
Front, back to the flow
Now keep on workin' at
With Jersey hat, with Jersey hat

[Chorus]

[Monica]
If you want me, you got to know me
If you want my love (c'mon)
You gotta wait, my love (shake 'em off, shake 'em off)
Baby, that's the way it's got to be
Get to know me (shake 'em off, shake 'em off)

[Chorus to end]
