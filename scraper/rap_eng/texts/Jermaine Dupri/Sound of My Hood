(Intro: JD)
It's Hard for me to sleep 'cause in my hood all I ever hear is...
(Hook: Sample)
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
(JD)
It's Hard for me to sleep 'cause in my hood all I ever hear is...

(Verse 1: Daddy Mac)
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Around my way they love to catch 'em coming out the mall
And you happen to gat, don't make it harder
'Cause it's still "Gimme that, while you at it, gimme them Jordans!"
No gangbanging, and nuthin' like that
Just some homies on the corner tryna sell a dump sack
But if the sale goes wrong
Then it sounds "Buck Buck" 'til it's gone "Buck Buck!" all night long
And don't be creepin' in your ride by yourself
Especially if the ride you rollin' is real delt
'Cause now gots to give it away, give it away now
And It's A Shame that you gots to lay down
"They said it's happy, you should have no fear"
Now, how is that when you layin' in bed and this is all you hear

(Hook: Sample)
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
It's Hard for me to sleep 'cause in my hood all I ever hear is... (Blam, blam)
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Ta-da BLAH, Ta-da BLAH, Ta-da, Ta-da, BOOM!

(Verse 2: Mac Daddy)
Yeah, Blam, boom, and it don't change
Some homies in the hood all do the same old thang
I ain't sayin' that it's wrong and I ain't sayin' it's right
I'm just tryna put you off on how them niggas survive
Late, night, don't be creepin' on your own
'Cause if ya don't slippin' then ya goin' home
Brother's like to get ya for whatever ya got to be, got
Especially when you be kickin' in a nice spot
Gettin' girls or pay the bills is what they ask a patient (?)
And never do, they askin' you, for your gold laces (?)
So when ya rollin' through the hood and you flossin'
Keep in mind that it just might cost ya
'Cause it's a chapter every single day
You might say no but then they say "Make my day"
And you ain't really have to start it, but since you did
Let's play a game called "Hit the moving target"

(Hook: Sample)
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
It's Hard for me to sleep 'cause in my hood all I ever hear is... (Blam, blam)
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
It's Hard for me to sleep 'cause in my hood all I ever hear is...

(Outro)
All I ever hear 'bout that, all I ever hear is gunshot
Big no no, so let's go loosen the Glock
When they flock, they makin' us flee of the spot
They jump in the car and they bust two shots
BANG BANG, they makin' us dance with a Glock
And then that explode and they get many rock
Give it a dance, give it a shook, and you get the flood flock
One tiny done shot and it rang BOOM!
