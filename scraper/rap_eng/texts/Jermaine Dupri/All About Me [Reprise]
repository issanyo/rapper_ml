[Foxy Brown]
Traces of my lipstick
Chorus
Does she know, where you go, when you leave
That you're always with me
And it's all about me
Does she know, it won't be long before
She's out the door, I'm in, number one
And it's all about me
Bop-di-di-bop
Mmm-bop-di-di-bop
(Does she know)
Bop-di-di-bop
Mmm-bop-di-di-bop
(That when you go)
Bop-di-di-bop
Mmm-bop-di-di-bop
(You and me, babe)
Bop-di-di-bop
Mmm-bop-di-di-bop
(Mmm-hmmm, does she know)
Bop-di-di-bop
Mmm-bop-di-di-bop
(That it won't be long)
Bop-di-di-bop
Mmm-bop-di-di-bop
(She's out the door, baby)
Music until fade
