[Verse 1: Bobby]
I know sometimes I seem a little crazy
I'm not too crazy in love
See, I'm not a trick
I can take it or leave it
You can be about it
'Cause I can do without it

[Pre-Chorus]
For some reason
You take your life for granted
Like it's a game
And you'll only win
The things you say
And the things you do
You act like it won't come to an end
You need to realize

[Chorus]
Easily you can be left alone
Tighten it up
You better
Before you find yourself by yourself
Easily you can be left alone
Tighten it up
You better
Before you find yourself by yourself

[Verse 2: Ralph]
Some people say that I'm
Nothing but a player
I don't play when it comes to my heart
Don't be so cruel
When you know everything is cool
You can be about it
Cause I can do without it, oh

[Verse 3: Ronnie]
Now I let you slide once
Let you slide twice
The third time, babydoll
It won't be so nice
You looking hot though
But you can't play Ron DeVoe
The laid back mack
With mad flow so here we go
I got a hottie with a mad body
Don't you know in the 5-0-0
On the way to the crib-o
So how you live
I had to ask my man Biv
Uh huh, it's looking kind of positive

[Chorus]
Easily you can be left alone
Tighten it up
You better
Before you find yourself by yourself
Easily you can be left alone
Tighten it up
You better
Before you find yourself by yourself

Easily you can be left alone
Tighten it up
You better
Before you find yourself by yourself

For some reason
You take your life for granted
Like it's a game
And you'll only win
The things you say
And the things you do
You act like it won't come to an end
You need to realize

Easily you can be left alone
Tighten it up
You better
Before you find yourself by yourself

Easily you can be left alone
Tighten it up
You better
Before you find yourself by yourself

Easily you can be left alone
Tighten it up
You better
Before you find yourself by yourself

Easily you can be left alone
Tighten it up
You better
Before you find yourself by yourself

Is this the part
You take my heart
And wipe your feet on?
