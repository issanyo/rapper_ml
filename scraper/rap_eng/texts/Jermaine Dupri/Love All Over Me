[Verse 1]
Must not have been paying attention
I stepped right on it
Didn't even notice how deep I was
I went from the ground to the top of the cloud
And now as I look down
I see where I fell into your arms

[Chorus]
Now I got love all over me
Baby, you touch every part of me
Oh, I got love all over me
And I don't wanna get it off
I'm completely covered up in your love

[Verse 2]
Even my skin is changing
I'm feeling warmer
No more icy blue hearts for me
You put the color back in my life
And now where there was black and white
You're becoming iridescent

[Chorus]
And I got love all over me
Baby, you touch every part of me
Oh, I, I got love all over me
And I don't wanna get it off
I'm completely covered up in your love

[Bridge]
Before your love, baby, I was muddy
So deep with pain 'til you took it from me
You showered me with a new beginning, now I'm clean
Took me by surprise when you ran up on me
I came to life, baby, in that moment
You put your hands on my heart
And baby, now it beats

[Chorus]
Now I got love all over me
And baby, you touch every part of me
Oh, I got love all over me
And I don't wanna get it off
I'm completely covered up in your love
In your love, in your love
And I don't wanna get it off
I'm completely covered in your love
Oh, I ...in your love
