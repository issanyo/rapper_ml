[Intro: Romeo]
Yeah, this is Romeo
And Immature's 'bout to drop that new jack funk on you
You livin' large
Duece
This psychological trio
Always on our worst behavior
Yo, what up, Half Pint?
Yo, Batman, kick it

[Verse 1: Batman]
People look out, we're coming at you
Immature's gonna turn it out (turn it out)
Doing what we won't do
Taking no shorts and breaking all the rules

[Pre-Chorus: Batman]
Don't be frontin' on us
'Cause we ain't having it, we're just having fun
Distrupting all of
'Cause a kid that rocks the cradle is a kid that rules the world

[Chorus (2x)]
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up

[Verse 2: Batman & Romeo]
Yo, Batman, drop the second verse
People always peeping our sound
'Cause we're nine years old and wiser than our years
We always do what people don't expect
But after Marq, we don't regret

[Pre-Chorus: Batman]
Don't be frontin' on us
'Cause we ain't having it, we're just having fun
Distrupting all of
'Cause a kid that rocks the cradle is a kid that rules the world

[Chorus (2x)]
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up

[Romeo (during Chorus)]
This is Romeo
And we still rocking that funky Immature stuff
In the house, we got Jermaine from the Kris Kross posse
To show you how deep we rolling
Jermaine, break them off something

[Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri]
Rip it up, tear it up, no, it doesn't matter what is
'Cause these kids
A little bad, but here they come like a bomb, hope you lay low
'Cause the tre from L.A. ain't no joke
Marq, the Don, don't forget Jerome
Three bad brothers got it going on, huh
Here's the flavor, nothing can save you
When they on their worst behavior

[Bridge]
Can't nobody, can't nobody play this
Immature
Can't nobody, can't nobody
Can't nobody play this

[Chorus (2x)]
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up

[Bridge (2x)]
Can't nobody, can't nobody play this
Immature
Can't nobody, can't nobody
Can't nobody play this

[Outro]
Waiting to holler, drop the sounds
