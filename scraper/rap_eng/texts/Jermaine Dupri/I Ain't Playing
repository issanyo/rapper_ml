[Intro: Bow Wow]
Back like we never left
You know it's Mr. Do It For the Ladies, baby
And I got my homeboy with me
Trey Songz, holla at 'em

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I see you lookin' at me exactly like you know what it do
When I leave where I'm at, make my way over to you
'Cause I ain't playin' with you girl, I just want you to know
I ain't playin' with you girl
If I whisper in your ear what's goin' through in my, in my head baby
I bet you turn around and tell me baby let's leave
'Cause I ain't playin' with you girl, I just want you to know
I ain't playin' with you girl

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Any girl JD used to bring around, I had a crush on
Wishin' I could take 'em to my room and get my touch on
If you was just a lil older is what they used to say
Kissin' me, huggin', callin' me baby, how they use to play
But now that I am 21, if you go to kissin' and huggin' me
Lil mommy I'm tryna cop somethin', I'm in the club now tearin' up
Tank top, standin' on the couch screamin', "Who bet I can't stop"
Album number 7, started at 11, steady youngest nigga killin' it
Shawty you better tell 'em uh, used to be your lil sister that I was concerned about
Now I want you, I see you lookin' now I'ma thug it out
Don't slip, look again, girl if you do, I'm goin' in
Lil mama what you waitin' for? I just want you to know
I ain't playin, I ain't playin', girl, you already know

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I see you lookin' at me exactly like you know what it do
When I leave where I'm at, make my way over to you
'Cause I ain't playin' with you girl, I just want you to know
I ain't playin' with you girl
If I whisper in your ear what's goin' through in my, in my head baby
I bet you turn around and tell me baby let's leave
'Cause I ain't playin' with you girl, I just want you to know
I ain't playin' with you girl

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
If you a fly young chick I'm a fly young nigga
Plenty dudes make fake us but nobody got a swag like mine
Feelin 'horny girl, I know you want me girl
I'm 'bout to tell you what I'm thinkin', baby close your eyes
I'm right here baby, I'm in your ear baby
Let's make a movie, need to get that ass in here baby
I like to drink a lot, let's take it to my spot
Soon as we hit the door, we gon' drink some more
And I'ma kiss you here and I'ma kiss you there
And I'ma kiss ya, kiss ya, kiss ya, kiss ya everywhere
Said I'ma kiss you there and I'ma kiss ya, kiss ya, kiss ya
Kiss ya everywhere

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I see you lookin' at me exactly like you know what it do
When I leave where I'm at, make my way over to you
'Cause I ain't playin' with you girl, I just want you to know
I ain't playin' with you girl
If I whisper in your ear what's goin' through in my, in my head baby
I bet you turn around and tell me baby let's leave
'Cause I ain't playin' with you girl, I just want you to know
I ain't playin' with you girl

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
Okay, hey say rock stars live the life, but I beg to differ
Tommy Lee and Nikki somethin' ain't got shit on this nigga
From some playboy bunnies, girls with their own money
Got 'em so backed up in my sidekick, it ain't funny
Got 'em high enough in parties, sometimes keep the red carpet
'Cause I don't know how to stop it once I get it started
I go hard, go hard when I'm in the paint
Quick to let you know I'm everythin' that your nigga ain't
If he ain't got a mil ticket, mansion, and a condo
Fleet full of cars than you need to let your man go
This ain't 'bout the money baby, this about a good time
And I ain't tryna replace your man I'm just talkin' 'bout this one time
And your mind saying'no but your body saying yes
How you droppin' in that dress and your eyes tell the rest
So don't slip, look again, girl if you do, I'm goin' in

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I see you lookin' at me exactly like you know what it do
When I leave where I'm at, make my way over to you
'Cause I ain't playin' with you girl, I just want you to know
I ain't playin' with you girl
If I whisper in your ear what's goin' through in my, in my head baby
I bet you turn around and tell me baby let's leave
'Cause I ain't playin' with you girl, I just want you to know
I ain't playin' with you girl
I see you lookin' at me exactly like you know what it do
When I leave where I'm at, make my way over to you
'Cause I ain't playin' with you girl, I just want you to know
I ain't playin' with you girl
If I whisper in your ear what's goin' through in my, in my head baby
I bet you turn around and tell me baby let's leave
'Cause I ain't playin' with you girl, I just want you to know
I ain't playin' with you girl
