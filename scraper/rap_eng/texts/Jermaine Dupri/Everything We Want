[Verse 1]
I wish I was closer to you than you feel
Our love can't be what it should be not until
We face our fears internally from the past
And forgive ourselves for moving way too fast
If we continue not to let it go
Pretty soon we're at a dead end road
With hearts made of bitter stone
Unable to give or receive love, right'?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna grow gray and old
And live and die in happiness as one soul
So come on, let's move on out of this storm

[Chorus]
Everything we want, we can have, baby
If we both want it bad enough, I know
Everything we want, we can have, baby
But we must build our faith and trust, our love

[Verse 2]
We need to share the things we think, honestly
Without sacrificing peace and made uneasy
We must revive the trust between us once again
And share just as much when we were friends'
Even after all that we've been through
I don't want nobody else but you
Better days are overdue for us two

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I just wanna, just wanna grow gray and old
And live and die in happiness as one soul
So come on, let's move on through the storm, hey

[Chorus]
Everything we want, we can have, baby
If we both want it bad enough, I know
Everything we want, we can have, baby
But we must build our faith and trust, our love

[Bridge]
Why are we living in unhappiness?
And constantly stressed (constantly stressed)
Forgetting how blessed we are to be together
We can do much better, I'm ready for a change
And I'm hoping you feel the same
So, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Everything we want
But we gotta believe, gotta believe
That we can have it
Believe that everything
Everything we want, we can have, baby
If we both want it bad enough, I know
Everything we want, we can have, baby
But we must build our faith and trust, our love
