Lay back, kick it
And enjoy the ride
Lay back, kick it
And enjoy the ride
Lay back, kick it
And enjoy the ride
Lay back, kick it
And enjoy the ride
Every man wants a woman
Where him and her can just go hang
Just the two of them alone, kick back
Doing their own thing
And every man wants a woman
That can always keep him in the mood
And I'm that kind of girl
So this is what I tell my dude
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
(Lay back, kick it)
(And enjoy the ride)
(Just kick it, just kick it)
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
(Lay back, kick it)
(And enjoy the ride)
(Just kick it, just kick it)
Every man wants a woman
That can cook him up a good meal
A woman he can treat like his homie
And take her out on the ave. and just chill
Every man wants a woman
That ain't good for just laying on her back
I'm that kind of woman
So before me and my man get in the sack
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
(Lay back, kick it)
(And enjoy the ride)
(Just kick it, just kick it)
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
(Lay back, kick it)
(And enjoy the ride)
(Just kick it, just kick it)
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
(Lay back, kick it)
(And enjoy the ride)
(Just kick it, just kick it)
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
(Lay back, kick it)
(And enjoy the ride)
(Just kick it, just kick it)
Lay back, kick it
And enjoy the ride
Lay back, kick it
And enjoy the ride
Lay back, kick it
And enjoy the ride
Lay back, kick it
And enjoy the ride
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
(Lay back, kick it)
(And enjoy the ride)
(Just kick it, just kick it)
