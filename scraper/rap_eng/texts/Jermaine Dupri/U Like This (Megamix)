Honey, you can have me when you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
Everytime you call me I'll come running
Cause what you got is far beyond compare

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya

One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin', don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside

I can't be elusive with you honey
Cause it's blatant that I've feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
Cause you're the only thing I wanna do

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin for ya, cryin for ya, I adore ya

One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin', don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey, honey
Honey, honey
It's like honey
Honey, honey
Honey, honey
It's like honey
It's like honey
It's like honey
It's like honey
It's like honey
It's like honey
It's like honey
I need it, I need it

I need a lover to give me
The kind of love that'll last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away, oh baby

I needs a lover who knows me
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights till the dawn
Why don't you take me away

Dreamlover, come rescue me take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately won't you please come around
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, babe

Ooh, oh yeah
On and on and on
So sweet, yeah
On and on and on

When you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind

But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Fantasy
Fantasy
Fantasy

On and on and on
On and on and on and on

Feel your body, feel your body, feel your
Feel your body, feel your body, feel your
Feel your body, feel your body, feel your
Feel your body, feel your body, feel your
Feel your body, feel your body, feel your
Feel your body, feel your body, feel your
Feel your body, feel your body, feel your

I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right

'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine

'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Always
Always baby
You'll always be my baby
You'll always be my baby yeah

Used to be as one
Baby once upon a time
Everlasting as it seemed
I thought you'd always be mine

Now I want you to be free
So I gotta let you fly
But I know in my heart
That our love will never die

Do do do, do do do do do do down
Do do do
Cause you'll always be my baby
Do do do, do do do do do do down
Do do do
You'll always be my baby
Do do do, do do do do do do down
Baby
Do do do, do do do do do do down
Do do do, do do do do do do down
Do do do, do do do do do do
Oh

Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
