[Kiely]
I'm on  the floor
Or on my back
But were both
Inside the beat
We don't even
Have to take a step
To take a trip
When you go with me
I almost can't control my body
And my head bout' to over heat
Bout' to take you on a ride
No keys just move your feet
While I

[3LW]
Hit the slow ride
Can you feel it
(tell me you can feel it baby)
Open your mind
Heavy breathing
(thoughts of leaving with me)
Now close your eyes
Are we there yet
(don't be scared to let go)
If you don't mind
I'm gonna make you
(I really wanna make you)
Dance to the beat of my drum
So I'm gonna make him
Dance to the beat of my drum
Gonna show him how to
Dance  to the beat of my drum
Cuz I wanna make ya
Dance to the beat of my drum
I'm gonna make you

[Adrienne]
I can tell that your holding
Back if you gotta
Golden jubilee
But you gotta face the black
Your gonna dream it
When you go to sleep
You might as well give
Into the music
Get the rocks from out your shoes
Hey Britney hit me baby one more time
I'll try again and get it into you

Dance  to the beat of my drum

A ride and slide with me
If you wanna take trip and
Dip with me
If you wanna lose control
And roll with me
And I'll put you
In a trance
So dance with me
And then we can

Hit the slow ride
