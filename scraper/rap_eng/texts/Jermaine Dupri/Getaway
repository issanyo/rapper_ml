[Verse 1]
Started as a little girl
Singing soul changed my world
Flipped my world upside down
I got lost and I couldn't be found
So much on my shoulders
And so much on my mind
Seems no one can help me
I think i just need some time

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish I could fly away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't hold my ground
But everybody need some time
That they can getaway

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wish I was invisible
'Cause then no one would know where I am
To ask me for anything
'Cause I've given so much of me
When is it time for me to receive?
'Cause Monica has her needs
Who's gonna look out for me?

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish I could hide away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't hold my ground
But everybody need some time
That they can getaway

[Bridge]
You know, I'm not superwoman
And I'm not made of steel
I try my best to handle
All I have to deal with
Not as easy as it seems
And to think this was my dream
Now for everything I have I'm grateful
But sometimes I wanna getaway

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish I could hide away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't hold my ground
But everybody need some time
That they can getaway
Sometimes I wish I could hide away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't stand my ground
But everybody need some time
That they can getaway
