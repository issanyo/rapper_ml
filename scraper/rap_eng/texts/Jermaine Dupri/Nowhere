If ever you wondered
If ever you were nervous about it
You gotta know
I ain't never
Lemme say that again
I ain't never, goin nowhere
Listen to me

Last night I allmost cried when you told me
That you think you love me more than I love you
Sometimes it hurts to carry that burden alone
Lets be clear and get a few things straight
No ones ever gunna take your place in my heart
Nothing can measure the love that I've got for you
I'm telling you

When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin nowhere, I ain't goin nowhere
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
That I'm gon be with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain't never goin nowhere

I was lost and abandoned
Searching for the truth
Looking for that missing one
That missing one was you
The road was so tough
But you gave it up
Untill I found you and you made it
Worth the wait and worth the years
Worth the strength and worth the tears
And you don't know the half of it
But baby heres the rest of it

Did you know that your a gift far brighter than the sun?
Did you know that your a blessing, and I'm the lucky one
Did you know that I could never ask for a better love
Did you know that I would die, before I broke your heart
Did you know that if you left me, my world would fall apart
And never come back together, baby that's for real
So the next time that you tell me, you'll remember this

When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin nowhere, I ain't goin nowhere
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
That I'm gon be with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain't never goin nowhere

When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin nowhere, I ain't goin nowhere
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
That I'm gon be with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain't never goin nowhere
