Love's a funny thing

(Verse 1 - Tameka)
Was only last night I felt you slip away
I tried so hard to hide the pain inside of me, babe
I held you close but you weren't with me
I felt your mind a thousand miles away

(Pre-Chorus - Tiny)
I was a fool to let you break me down
You think by now that I would know just what to expect from you, oh
Every time I fall, I make myself believe that you are changing
And some day the sun will shine through

Chorus (Tiny adlibs)
Love is a funny thing
(Love is so funny)
Your love is a funny thing
(I don't know what to do)
Love is a funny thing
(Please boy I don't wanna fall, don't wanna fall in love again)

(Verse 2 - LaTocha)
When I first met you your heart was empty
You were innocent and so full of joy
But now you've changed and I don't know you
You played me baby like a toy

(Pre-Chorus - Tiny)
You see, I was surprised to see you with that girl
When you said you'd never ever ever ever see her again, no
I don't want to control you, so baby if she's gonna hold you
Then why don't you just stay, stay where you've been

Chorus (Tiny adlibs)
Love is a funny thing
(Oh, your love your love)
Your love is a funny thing
(why yuou wanna do me wrong boy)
Love is a funny thing
(I said love is a funny thing
I never never wanna fall again no no no)

(Bridge - Kandi)
Everybody needs someone to hold them through the night
And everybody needs someone to tell them it's alright
I gave you my heart and you only turned away
So tell me baby, what's going to make you stay

Chorus (LaTocha adlibs)
Love is a funny thing
(Walk out the door baby)
Your love is a funny thing
(Stop playing with my love)
Love is a funny thing
(no no
No no no
I never ever wanna fall in love again)
