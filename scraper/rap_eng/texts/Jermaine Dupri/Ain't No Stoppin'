[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri]
Come on, come on, come on
I wanna hear that shit bump, bump
You know what I'm sayin'
Who ya know with the big cash flow
Beats hotter than tobasco
And I love to see a honey shake her ass slow
By now you should know this ain't a bitch
I won't cut it if I think you can fuck with it
I be the infamous sparking all these hoes
Interest as we enter this
R&B with a twist J.E. is what it is
Now tell me baby can you handle this
Alot of ice on the wrist make a list to match
Here it so so us cats count doe by the stack
Cause it jumps of racks and stores
Which leads to a hallway of plaques and whores
Those signs that read "the world is yours"
And when they come on in clubs people pack the floors
I make hits, then I dip with a dip to the tropical
Known to the world as J.D. the unstoppable

[Verse 2: Jagged Edge]
Right about now is when I ask you for this dance
Hope you don't turn it down they just put on our jam
And I've been watchin' you til everybody know all
Night
Don't try to fight this feeling cause all you gotta do
Is let it go

[Chorus: Jagged Edge]
Girl this thang is all so serious babe
Waiting long enough let's hit the floor babe
Ain't no stoppin', we got this place on up
Ain't no stoppin', we got this place on up
Ain't no stoppin', can't stop, won't stop
Ain't no stoppin', can't stop, won't stop, no

[Verse 3: Jagged Edge]
Girl you and I know that it's time that we
Put everything aside and dance all night
What you wanna do, I just wanna rock with you
So girl don't shy, put your hand in mine

[Chorus: Jagged Edge]
Girl this thang is all so serious babe
Waiting long enough let's hit the floor babe
Ain't no stoppin', we got this place on up
Ain't no stoppin', we got this place on up
Ain't no stoppin', can't stop, won't stop
Ain't no stoppin', can't stop, won't stop, no

[Outro: Jagged Edge]
I came to bring the pain hard corp to the brain
(We got this place on up)
I came to bring the pain hard corp to the brain
(Can't stop, won't stop no)
I came to bring the pain hard corp to the brain
(We got this place on up)
I came to bring the pain hard corp to the brain
(Can't stop, won't stop no)
