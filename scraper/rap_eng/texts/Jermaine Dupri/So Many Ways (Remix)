[Intro: Jay Z (Jermaine Dupree)]
Uh
This that shit
Come on
Rocafella y'all
Aha
(So so def y'all)
(Jay Z)
Come on

[Verse 1: Jay Z (Jermaine Dupree)]
We click like the Cali cartel
Stack the ice and cream like Carvel
(It ain't hard to tell)
From NY to the ATL
So So diggity and Rocafella get busy
My mane, hold your head like a migraine
Summer edition, lyrics by Jay Z, beats by Jermaine
We bounce like a ice in your eye
Don't need to know the price, just your size
In so many ways
We trick (ha ha)
A little change like a remix
(ha ha)
But everything remains the same
Same song, bragging on a track with the Braxtons
Attacking, full court press, all game long
Ladies hang Shawn on the mantle over the sofa
Your sex drive needed a chauffeur, I rushed over
Placed my iced out hand on your shoulder, went a little lower
Got so many ways, but that should hold ya

[Chorus: The Braxtons]
In so many ways I can love you
(So many ways)
So many ways I can blow your mind
(I can blow your mind)

So many ways I can love you
(I can love you right)
So many ways, show you a real good time
Count the ways

[Verse 2: The Braxtons]
You don't know just what I'd do for you
Love you tender, love you oh so good
I can't wait to get to it babe, I wanna do it baby
To show you what I'm all about, yeah

I turn on some music
And dim the lights
Say everything you like to hear
And do what you like

Do all the things
You don't expect me to do
You can see how many ways I can love you
Let me count the ways

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: The Braxtons]
I need somebody I'll take to any extreme
To show you just what I mean
I doubt if you have ever been with someone like me
Cause all I want to do is make you happy

I turn on some music
And dim the lights
Say everything you like to hear
And do what you like

Do all the things
You don't expect me to do
You can see how many ways I can love you
Let me count the ways

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 4: The Braxtons]
I turn on some music
And dim all the lights
Say everything you like to hear
And do what you like

And do all the things
You don't expect me to do
You can see how many ways I can love you
Let me count the ways

[Chorus]
