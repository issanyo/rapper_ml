[Intro: Janet]
Breathe

Get me so excited, I'm hot, come on
Get me so excited, I'm hot, come on
Get me so excited, I'm hot
Get me so excited, I'm hot
Get me so...

[Chorus: Janet + Khia]
I'm hot, come on, so get it, get it
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can...
Act bad
Don't hurt me
Look sexy
Talk dirty
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
Get me so excited

[Verse 1: Janet]
For some girls it might be the money that really turns you on
But for me it's an attitude that keeps me dialin' your phone
And no words are suitable to describe your swagger babe
And my body is in overdrive dying to have you inside of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you like it when I do it?
I go head to toe
And whenever you pursue it
You'll never hear the word "no"
So forget about them other girls, baby
'Cause now you're rolling with a woman, baby
I'ma keep your body thumping, baby
It's the least I can do
'Cause you get me so excited

[Chorus: Janet + Khia]
I'm hot, come on, so get it, get it
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can...
Act bad
Don't hurt me
Look sexy
Talk dirty
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
Get me so excited

[Verse 2: Janet]
For some girls it's about mind control they don't want to give dudes their props
As for me I'm a let you know that my body's smoking hot
Throw me up against whatever's close and get to bossing me around
And everytime I give you the assist you know how to slam it down

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you like it when I do it?
I go head to toe
And whenever you pursue it
You'll never hear the word "no"
So forget about them other girls baby
Cause now you're rolling with a woman baby
I'ma keep your body thumping baby
It's the least I can do
'Cause you get me so excited

[Chorus: Janet + Khia]
I'm hot, come on, so get it, get it
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can...

Anytime you want me to
Get me so excited
