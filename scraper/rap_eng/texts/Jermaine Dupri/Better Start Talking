[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
I'm so sincere with it I just want you to know
If you can feel it rock back and forth
He's so sincere with it
We just want you to know if you can feel it rock back and forth
I'm so sincere with it I just want you to know
If you can feel it rock back and forth
We so sincere with it we just want you to know
If u can't feel it rock back and forth
Lets go

[Verse 1: Donnell Jones]
Settle down thinking that I can let ya talk to me that way
Making that move, the one that could be creeping and taking your place
You don't even know
Where I be, when we argue now
You gon' be here lonely yeah
Cuz she knows what I need at night

[Chorus: Donell Jones]
Can't you, see she wants to (take your place)
She wanna give me everything that you don't
Don't let her just walk in
Don't make a (big mistake)
Thinking I'm so caught up I can't let go
You better start (talking)

[Verse 2: Donell Jones]
Tell me why should I
Be here tonight
See you don't wanna
Hurt me but we both know this thing just ain't right
When I go (and I go)
It's gonna be a little too late
To try get back again
When I don't have this feeling no more

[Bridge: Donell Jones]
Now we're ain't gonna be talking no more (no more)
She's gonna be the reason I leave you alone
And I feel (some day you'll see when I'm gone)
So right now
You better speak
And give me a reason

[Chorus: Donell Jones]
Girl can't you see
She wants to (take your place)
She wanna give me everything that you don't
Don't let her just walk in
Don't make a (big mistake)
Thinking I'm so caught up I can't let go
You better start (talking)

[Bridge: Donell Jones]
This shit is over (you betta start talking)
Shoulda ended long ago (you better start talking)
But I stayed around thinking that something in your head 'd start clicking
But I can see that I was all wrong (you betta start talking)
I can't be a fool no more (you betta start talking)
She wants to be that one to give me that love you ain't ready for
You better start talking, girl

[Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri]
I go to the club strictly to party and find something to twerk with
I'm the dude that all the girls wanna flirt with
Jump up in the booth show me just how they work it
So shortly your window is small to work with
I see it in your eyes but you ain't saying nothing
Your girl doing everything trying to push my buttons
Symbolizing us leaving and me cutting
Easy like Tiger' on the green when he putting
You betta start talking
Shorty wanna do something
Do something too live crew man man
Shorty wanna move something
And you front like it ain't what it is
Bout to lose all this cuz u ain't handle yo bizz
After two shots of the three
She was all on me
And you seen it but try to play it like a PIMP
Now I respect that
But sometimes that's a set back
And I really can't see u setting back lettin' that
Be the reason we ain't breezin' through the city
Girl you better start talking

[Chorus: Donell Jones]
Can't you see she wants to (take your place)
She wanna give me everything that you don't
Don't let her just walk in
Don't make a (big mistake)
Thinking I'm so caught up I can't let go
You better start (talking)
She wants to (take your place)
She's wanna give me everything that you don't
Don't let her just walk in
Don't make a (big mistake)
Thinking I'm so caught up I can't let go
You better start (talking)

[Outro: Jermaine Dupri]
I'm so sincere with it I just want you to know
If you can feel it rock back and forth
He's so sincere with it
We just want you to know
If you can feel it rock back and forth
I'm so sincere with it
If you can feel it rock back and forth
He's so sincere with it
If you can feel it rock back and forth
