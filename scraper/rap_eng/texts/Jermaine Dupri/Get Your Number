[Intro: Jermaine Dupri & Mariah Carey]
Hah, you know girl, it's crazy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
See, I've always been wanting a girl like you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
So fine, motherfucker, he-he-he
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Can I, can I get your number?

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri]
Oh, damn, the club 'bout to close in a minute
Can I get your number, baby, so you and I can go get in it?
Let me come and pick you up, I'm gon' take you out
Can I get your number, baby
So I can show you what I'm all about?
What I'm all about? Damn!

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I've been checking you out
And I noticed that you ain't just one of the crowd
So tell me won't you come over and see about me, baby?
I've got the Cry's on ice, I'm about to get in
Up in V-I-P with all my ladies

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Tell me how many times in your life
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight?
Tell me a little something about you
Hear a little something about me
I got a house in Capri and my own G4
And a Benz with the doors that lift up from the floor

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Mariah Carey]
Oh damn! The club 'bout to close in a minute (Ooh)
Can I get your number, baby, so you and I can go get in it?
Let me come and pick you up
I'm gon' take you out (Take me out)
Can I get your number, baby
So I can show you what I'm all about?
What I'm all about? Damn!

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
Now that you're sitting next to me, I bet you're wondering
What my intentions are for you and I to get into
Baby, I just wanna hug and kiss and love you
Look into my eyes, baby, don't be shy
Is it yes or no? We ain't got all night!

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Tell me how many times in your life
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight?
Tell me a little something 'bout you
Hear a little something 'bout me
I've got a big penthouse with a sick hot tub
We can watch the flat screen while the bubbles filling up

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Mariah Carey]
Oh damn! The club 'bout to close in a minute (Ooh)
Can I get your number, baby, so you and I can go get in it?
(Tonight)
Let me come and pick you up, I'm gon' take you out
Can I get your number, baby
So I can show you what I'm all about? (Baby)
What I'm all about? Damn!

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
Lalalala, la, la
Lalalala, lalalala
Lalalala, la, lala, lala, lala, lala
Lalalala, la, la
Lalalala, lalalala
Lalalala, la, lala, lala, lala, lala
Oh, baby, hey!

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Mariah Carey]
Oh damn! The club 'bout to close in a minute (Ooh)
Can I get your number, baby, so you and I can go get in it?
(I wanna go get in it)
Let me come and pick you up
I'm gon' take you out (take me out)
Can I get your number, baby
So I can show you what I'm all about?
What I'm all about? Damn!
