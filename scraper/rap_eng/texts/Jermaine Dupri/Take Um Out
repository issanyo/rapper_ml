Come, come take a dip, as I toughly, roughly repeatedly rip
Of you punks that's got a whole lot to live for
It ain't my fault, you and your crew came soggy
And didn't think about being hard until you saw me
So what you did is make it good, hit 'em good
But for me to you it sounds like you swinging on (DEEZ NUTZ!)
Tryna look like, sound like, hang around like, be down like the quicker quicker ripper, right?
(But you not welcome quicker baby rock baby pop, when we do what we do we rock the party non-stop)
