Everything I am
Everything I was
Has been elevated
Through the power of your love

Everything I've lost
Everything I've gained
No longer makes a difference
Since you changed my name

Got my heart beat faster
I can barely catch my breath
Boy, you took the pain from my chest

Now I look at us
Parallel to the stars
Boy, you claim my heart
You're so amazing

You are amazing
When I thought that I have seen it all
Came and shown me
I ain't seen nothing

You are amazing
When my back was up against the wall
It was you that hit the restart button
Took me to a better place
Show me some better ways
Now I should be living my life
Each and every day

Been through so much
Never thought that you would exist
But ain't nobody ever made me feel like this
You are amazing

Everywhere I've been
Everything I've done
All the falls in comparison
To the compassion you show me

Every time that you hold me
And when I'm in your arms
I can do anything for you
Got my heart beat faster
I can barely catch my breath
Boy, you took the pain from my chest

Now I look at us
Parallel to the stars
Boy, you claim my heart
You're so amazing

You are amazing
When I thought that I have seen it all
Came and shown me
I ain't seen nothing
You are amazing

When my back was up against the wall
It was you that hit the restart button
Took me to a better place
Show me some better ways
Now I should be living my life
Each and every day

Been through so much
Never thought that you would exist
But ain't nobody ever made me feel like this
You are amazing

You never left my sight
I was lost
But you found me and saved my life
I could have died
No love inside
Before you
I was stone inside
But you made me feel again
Boy, I swear you are amazing

You are amazing
When I thought that I have seen it all
Came and shown me
I ain't seen nothing

You are amazing
When my back was up against the wall
It was you that hit the restart button
Took me to a better place
Show me some better ways
Now I should be living my life
Each and every day

Been through so much
Never thought that you would exist
But ain't nobody ever made me feel like this
You are amazing

Gave me a new life
When you made me your wife
Yes, you did
And I love, love, love you
Is nothing I would not do for you
Thank you
