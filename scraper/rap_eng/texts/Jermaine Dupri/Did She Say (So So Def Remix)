Oh shit

[Bow Wow]
So So to the Def, uh uh, J.E., Bow Wow
6 in the mornin, moms at my door
Air force all whited, cross the kitchen floor
Gotta interview the Dew, I ain't tryin to be late
But I can't leave the house without my Funk Flex tape
You know me, A.K.A little Cold Crush
Keep it hoppin like a 6-4 juiced up
Keep it poppin from the Tunnel to the plush
So So Def, yeah that's us

[Jagged Edge]
Tell me how can you, believe everything you hear
She ain't tellin you, cuz she really wants to be here, with me
And she would do anything to get with me so please
Don't believe a thing that she says to you

"Did She Say" she, that she been callin me, baby
And she told you I was no good
How bout them time, she tried to give it to me
"Did She Say" that she wanted me, "Did She Say"?

The first time that she, stabbed you in your back
Open up your eyes and see, a real friend wouldn't do that
Cuz you need to sit her down, and let her know
Came at supper. Good thing. So go
I just wanna know one thing, baby "Did She Say"

That I want your man, makin all sorts of plans
Tryna get me away from you
And as soon as you're gone, she's tryna get it on
Baby, don't you listen to what she say

[J.D.]
Uh-uh, uh, uh, uh, we don't stop
Yo, uhh
Now when my pager go..
Who you think that is?
My bitch? No, your bitch, see
She like you, but she in love with me
And how I go back and forth with the B R A T

[Da Brat]
When the 2-way vibrate
It's yo nigga that's tryna come up on a hot date
To get next to Chantee
Face it, he only fuck you cuz he was wasted
And now he want a replacement

[J.D.]
Basically, you listenin to the hottest fam since the Jackson 5
We don't run outside, we hit the middle with the dive
Play ice in the 20 inches on the ride
Play when ya see me

[Da Brat]
You see me, same thing, same way
Radio, TV, are up in your face
It's us, the disgustingly, bust and come up

[J.D.](Brat)
Wit our head out the window scream
(We don't give a fuck)
Meet us dead in the red till the
(Shit blow up)
