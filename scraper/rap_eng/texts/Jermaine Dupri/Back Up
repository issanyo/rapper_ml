[Intro: Da Brat & (Jermaine Dupri)]
This a test
(Bounce) uh, uh, uh-oh
This ain't no test
(Bounce) uh, uh, uh-oh
It's the real shit
(Bounce) uh, uh, uh-oh
(Bounce) uh, uh, uh-oh
Yeah
(Bounce) uh, uh, uh-oh
(Bounce) uh-oh (bounce)

[Verse 1: Da Brat & (Jermaine Dupri)]
If you can feel it in your back (Baby)
It's the sounds of the motherfuckin' Brat (Baby)
In the corner passing blunts, sippin' Yack (Baby)
And if you must play the game
Then gamble the stake's raised
Take baby to Vegas I need the paper
My flesh burnin'
Niggas got me under surveillance their necks turnin'
I'm an international playa, close observation
The best policy is to stay in y'all faces
The bad seed, I get niggas like I breath it's easy
Been through niggas lyin' and cheatin' with bitches that's sleazy
None of it's worth repeatin'
If you flash money, spend that money or you can beat it
I'mma star now, so it wasn't really shit for me to get shot down
Spit illicit, unrestricted game, I'm independent
Open the door to the bank but g's spent this

[Chorus: Da Brat & Ja Rule]
If you out here doing things
You're a honey getting money
Playin' all of these fellas like dummies
Make all the right moves when it comes to the game
(Tell them they better back up)
(Playa, playa back up)
If you out here doing things
(Doin' doin' thangs)
You're a playa getting money
Spending none on none of these hoes
Make all the right moves when it comes to the game
(Tell 'em they better back up)
(Shorty, shorty back up)

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
For the first time I can see my lifeline
And you're ahead of me
Thank God hard to imagine me
But Lord why me?
I'm the bad spirit that tortures the souls of the nearest
Untouched pussy, what'chu want with me?
Been through lesbianage, menage et tois
Been even synonymous to hoes that floss and trick their dough
If you livin' it, my life
You live it as limited
Cause too many worlds collide the killer degenerate
I'll die in it
As long as I keep my guns burn
And Brat pushin' the Verge
And the crack isn't German
Listen Ja bring the heat catching niggas on their third wind
We supply the pressure (Baby!)
Shit it'll never end try to get out
But baby you're locked in
My world sip Hen and suffer from sin
I'm sickening like Heroin
Ja Rule the veteran, true with you
But baby girl if you

[Chorus: Da Brat & Ja Rule]
If you out here doing things
You're a honey getting money
Playin' all of these fellas like dummies
Make all the right moves when it comes to the game
(Tell them they better back up)
(Playa, playa back up)
If you out here doing things
(Doin' doin' thangs)
You're a playa getting money
Spending none on none of these hoes
Make all the right moves when it comes to the game
(Tell 'em they better back up)
(Shorty, shorty back up)

[Verse 3: Da Brat & Ja Rule]
A girl like me need a lot
So I proceed to plot
And continue to add pieces to the rock collection that I got
Shine on y'all light up the whole block
I'm causing on Ja
Shit on a nigga like me you need a lot
Coming with game, what'chu got
It's murda, if you don't get shot
I clicky-clack on those pot post up on niggas
Fuck y'all bitches
Shit fuck y'all niggas, you can't live without pussy
Be disrespectful and get no more nookie
Most of these hoes check y'all cause niggas ain't shit
Y'all dismissed and y'all know
Bitches ain't shit
But live with it if the dick don't fit
Get it or quit it
And acquaint Shaunte with your money
I gotta get it

[Chorus: Da Brat & Ja Rule]
If you out here doing things
You're a honey getting money
Playin' all of these fellas like dummies
Make all the right moves when it comes to the game
(Tell them they better back up)
(Playa, playa back up)
If you out here doing things
(Doin' doin' thangs)
You're a playa getting money
Spending none on none of these hoes
Make all the right moves when it comes to the game
(Tell 'em they better back up)
(Shorty, shorty back up)

[Outro: Da Brat]
All I'm saying is do thangs
Ya know what I'm saying
Make the right moves
Ya know what I'm saying
Man, woman, boy, or girl
Pimp, prostitute, he-heh
Do thangs to get that loot
Ya know what I'm saying
Tell 'em to back up
Cause it's the Da Brat
So, So
