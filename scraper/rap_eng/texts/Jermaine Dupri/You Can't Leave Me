[Verse 1]
Ooh, oh, yeah, Saturday
You kinda got mad at me
Then you went and said some things
I know you didn't really mean
You said you wasn't feelin' me
And I can see who I wanna see
And all that talk about you going to leave
Who think is gonna believe?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if you was on you're way out the door
Would've been gone long time ago
Would've been making plans and packing clothes
Leaving keys but I got you on your knees

[Chorus]
Talk if you wanna talk, if you wanna walk
Walk if you wanna walk, if you wanna front
Front like you gonna leave
You know you wanna be here with me
You can't leave me
Talk if you wanna talk, if you wanna walk
Walk if you wanna walk, if you wanna front
Front like you gonna leave
You know you wanna be here with me
You can't leave me

[Verse 2]
Late that day
You wanna get next to me
And tell me that you're so sorry
I wasn't stressing about you anyway
Hmm it's been some days
And you're still in my face
Talkin' bout how I feel you babe
I see I got you hooked on me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause, if you was on you're way out the door
Would've been gone long time ago
Would've been making plans and packing clothes
Leaving keys but I got you on your knees

[Chorus]
Talk if you wanna talk, if you wanna walk
Walk if you wanna walk, if you wanna front
Front like you gonna leave
You know you wanna be here with me
You can't leave me
Talk if you wanna talk, if you wanna walk
Walk if you wanna walk, if you wanna front
Front like you gonna leave
You know you wanna be here with me
You can't leave me

[Bridge]
Talk if you want to, front if you want
Be where you want to
I know you want to be with me
Talk if you want to, front if you want
Be where you want to
I know you want to be with me

[Chorus]
Talk if you wanna talk, if you wanna walk
Walk if you wanna walk, if you wanna front
Front like you gonna leave
You know you wanna be here with me
You can't leave me
Talk if you wanna talk, if you wanna walk
Walk if you wanna walk, if you wanna front
Front like you gonna leave
You know you wanna be here with me
You can't leave me

[Outro]
Talk if you want to, front if you want
Be where you want to
I know you want to be with me
Talk if you want to, front if you want
Be where you want to
I know you want to be with me
