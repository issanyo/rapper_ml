I mean, I mean, heh
Y'all know what that is right?
I mean, I mean
Y'all know what that is right? Uhh

[Chorus]
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' mama (shake shake that back girl) I wanna see ya
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' lil' mama, show me how you move it
Lil' mama (shake shake that back girl)

[Bow Wow]
Tags on the back of the Lamb' say B-Dub
Everynight I'm in the streets and I'm G'd up
5th album and I'm still bangin out ya spea-kers
SoSoDef, can't nobody see us
You know I keep it fresh when it comes to the fashion
At the age 10 is when my momma heard the passion
I gotta stay stuntin and I gotta keep flashin
7 figure checks is the only thing I'm cashin, I smash it
Everything I get on it look tight
Ain't nothin like a hump when it jump and it shook right, shook right
Ladies on a homey like I'm Denzel
Shirt off, big chain rockin like I'm LL
Since 12 I done had a mill' sittin in my garage
Lil' Brazilian girls comin givin me a massage
Before I was, people was treat me like a big {ass} star
It's a test if you wanna be in my entourage, uhh

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow]
I keep catchin all my lil' comp in a slumber
Comin with that heat that keep me hotter than a summer
Call it what you want, I'm the king of Columbus
And if you wanna act up, D got the dumper (how you ride)
'Round here I'm ridin 30's on a Hummer
Tag on the back of it say "Boy Wonder"
Fo' 15's beats sound like thunder
The baddest girl up in here, I better get her number
When I was younger, momma said I was a dreamer
Moved to Atlanta, stayed with J.D. and Teena
Never ever though, I'd be sellin out arenas
Drivin e'rythang from a Phantom to a Beemer
Baby is you hearin what I'm sayin, I'm the real deal
{Nigga} that you wit, he a snack I'm a full meal
I see you got it in the back like Jessica Beale
But you talkin baby all I wanna know if it's trill
Now let me see

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow]
Groove with it (groove with it) do it (do it)
Girl turn around and show me how you move it, I said
Groove with it (groove with it) do it (do it)
Girl turn around and show me how you move it
Rollin with the B it's like when you fly first class
E'rything free, much different than them dirtbags
I'm an entertainer keep you focused like a circus
God put me here to get it poppin, that's my purpose
{Niggas} say they know me cause they gettin overpowered
See I make it storm and the {bitch} make it shower
20 minutes all he got, I last four hours
So when I come around, he outta business like Tower
Baby it ain't trickin if you got it, that's the motto
Hitmakers ballin like we just hit the lotto
Front and back, y'all feel with e'ry kind of auto
Take your pick and you can bring it back tomorrow long as you let me see it

[Chorus]
