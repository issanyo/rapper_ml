I been watching you for so damn long but I don't know what to say or do
I be sittin' around fantasizin' bout' what I wanna do to you
Here's somethin' about the way you move your body I can't take
Specially when you turn around and you make ur ass shake
You da the number one most requested in the club like one of my jams
But no matter what when I come in your right here where I am
Breakin' it down like we in bed
Gotta a nigga spedin' up all his bread
Bendin' over to the front
Lookin' back at me like whatcha want

((Missy & Jermaine))

I gotta getcha getcha getcah getcha
Someday, Someday
I gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
(Repeat)

(2: (Missy))

I gotta getcha, I gotta getcha
And it don't matter if that's ur bitch wit'cha
Cause my man's here too so let's switch up
And we be lookin' at each other get the picture
And my body not Beyonce' but big girls we been holdin' it down
And light-skin used to be way in but brown-skin is tha hot shit now
And don't take me as a one-hit wonder keep me hangin' out on the show
Ya betta act like I'm tha real deal and real bitches I'm tha last one left
Might not see me up in a thong but I'll be rockin' my addais suit
Ur chick can put a tight dress on but she still won't look this cute

((Missy & Jermaine))

I gotta getcha getcha getcah getcha
Someday, Someday
I gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
(Repeat)

I got check books, credit cards, all that shit just tell me hows it gotta go down
And usually I ain't gotta trick but I will though (Kay)
Cause you super bad and for real though (Kay)
Ohh can't wait for my lips to kiss ur lips both sets but you don't hear me though, (Hear me thought)

(4: (Missy))

Ain't fittin' to talk playa go do ya part yeah I like ur southern draw might letcha eat it raw
Is ya really hard don't stop get it ya'll down by law let me take ya to the titty bar
These chicks ain't shit I mean none of ya'll
Come on get it get it run up in the suga bars

((Missy & Jermaine))
