[Left Eye]
A-yo what's up
This is Left Eye
Uhhh you know cuz the eye is right
Check out this phat remix kinda like Slim Fast
Baby baby baby
Ya know what I'm sayin'
T-Boz won't you kick the ballistics

[T-Boz]
And you want my love
Well that's alright
Well it will be there for you morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good
And do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life
Well you wanna be loved (uh)
Hey that's O.K
Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down
A nickel gotta be true
Cause otherwise this "B" ain't got no time for you

Chorus:
Oh baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Ooh (baby, baby,) baby, baby, baby
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Chorus

[T-Boz]

Well you want my heart (uh)
And all my time
Well it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me (uh)
Won't stand for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

[Chilli]

Long as you know that I could have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up

Ohhhhhh

Chorus

Baby, baby, baby
Ain't got no time for the part-time lovin'
I got so much love in me
I gotta be loved
And that's O.K

Baby, baby, baby
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep
(Get me off)

[Chilli]

Baby long as you know that I could have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and it's factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up

[T-Boz]

Well you want my heart
And all my time
Well it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me
I won't stand for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

[Left Eye]

Excuse me if I put a lot on it
Dag gone it
As if you didn't know how much you want to really want it
In place it has effects in case your mind is in the gutter
I left the triple A's
And she surely don't stutter
A privilege it is to be considered as a great
And you remind me of my past cuz they are very uplifting
And plan to give a little but a lot is what you want
And like my hat is to da back we can both sit down in front
I understand what a man is all about
You understand I can't have anybody else without a doubt
We understand that you as you I wouldn't want to be without
Understandin' is the key which holds a very large amount
And bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Heck just expect to be checked
Return the favor and the rest just flows
I'll be standin' on my toes as the rest turn into ho's

Chorus

[Chilli]

I can have any man that I want to
Time and place that I choose to
But I think you know that I'd rather be here with you

[Chilli & T-Boz]

Yeah
That's actual and factual
You're the one I seem to run back to
Just to get me off
You got to love me, got to love me, got to love me...
