[Verse 1]
I misbehaved, done some things I know I shouldn't do
I touched myself, even though you told me not to
You commanded me to wait for you
(I tried)
But I can smell you on my sheets
Taste you on my skin so vividly
Daddy, I disobeyed ya
Now I want you to come punish me

[Chorus]
Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Don't hold back
I've been very bad
Make me cry
Daddy, make me cry
Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Don't hold back
I've been very bad
Make me cry
Oh, make me cry
Babe

[Verse 2]
I misbehaved
And my punishment should fit my crime
Tie me to something
Take off all my clothes
Daddy I want you to take your time
(I'm scared)
My heart is beating fast
Shiver as you grab my neck
Daddy, blindfold me daddy
It's better when I don't know what to expect

[Chorus]
Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Baby, don't hold back
I've been very bad
Oh, baby, make me cry
Daddy, make me cry
Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Baby, don't hold back
I've been very bad
Daddy, make me cry
Daddy, make me cry
Babe

[Bridge]
Did I upset you daddy?
Take out your frustrations on me
Did I make you mad?
Take out your frustrations on me
You be the teacher, I'll be the student
Tell me to do it, and I will do it
I'm under your command
You be the teacher, I'll be the student
Tell me to do it, and I will do it

[Chorus]
Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Don't hold back
I've been very bad
Daddy, make me cry
Daddy, make me cry
Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Baby, don't hold back
I've been very bad
Daddy, make me cry
Babe

[Outro]
(Take out your frustrations on me)
(Take out your frustrations on me)
(Take out your frustrations on me)
