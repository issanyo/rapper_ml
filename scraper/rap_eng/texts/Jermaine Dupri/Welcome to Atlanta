[Ludacris]
Yeah
Welcome to Atlanta, jackin' hammers and vogues
Back to the mackin' and jackin the clothes, adolescent packin a fo'
A knock on the do', who is it? I would happen to know
The one with the flow - who did it?, it was me I suppose
JD in the Rolls and Luda's in the Cut Supreme
Skatin down Old Nat, gat tucked and leaned
I split ya spleen, as a matter of fact I split ya team
No blood on the sneaks, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean
I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams
I'm allergic so doc' prescribed antihistamines
Oink oink, pig pig, do away with the pork
Only silverware I needs a steak knife and a fork
Did you forget your fuckin manners, I'm Bruce with Banners
Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when I shoot the cannon
The wooly mammoth sabretooth, bitch bite your tongue
I won't stop until I'm rich as them whites'll come
I pulled up in the black Lotus, your plaques are bogus
So I stripped them off the wall
Waitin for my cue to corner pocket eight balls, you rackin 'em up
I'm big paper like pancakes, stackin 'em up
In fact I'm slappin 'em up, Cadallac'n the truck
I can't loose with twenty-two, bitch that's what's up
Runnin in the back to fuck, better tha-than the aquaduct
Chil-li-li-li-li-n.. fli-pi-pi-pi-pi-n, what?

[Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, y-y-yo, yo, yo
Y-y-yo yo, yo-yo-yo
Yo yo-yo-yo, yo-yo, yo
Y-yo, yo, yo-yo-yo-yo-yo yo

[Hook: J.D. followed by Ludacris]
Welcome to Atlanta where the players play
And we ride on dem thangs like ev-ery day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin
And parties dont stop 'til eight in the mo'nin

Welcome to Atlanta where the players play
And we ride on dem thangs like ev-ery day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin
And parties dont stop 'til eight in the mo'nin

[Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, uhh
Now the party don't start 'til I walk in
And I usually don't leave until the thang ends
But in the meantime, in between time
You work yo' thing, I'll work mine
I been puttin it down here since eighty-three
Since the Lakeshore/MD rivalry
When Frozen Paradise was the place to be
If you was ridin, you was bumping to homie Shy-D
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballin-ist Player
Make my own rules, bitch call me the mayor
Monday night, Gentlemen's Club
Tuesday night, I'm up in the Velvet Room, gettin fucked up
Wednesday, I'm at Strokers on lean
Thursday, Jump Clean, then I fall up in Kream
Friday, Shark Bar, Kaya with Frank Ski
Right on the flo' is where you can find me
Saturday, is off the heezy fo' sheezy
You can find me up in One-Tweezy
Sunday, is when I get my sleep in
Cause on Monday we be at it again, holla!

[Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, y-y-yo, yo, yo
Y-y-yo yo, yo-yo-yo
Yo yo-yo-yo, yo-yo, yo
Y-yo, yo, yo-yo-yo-yo-yo yo
