[Intro: Mariah Carey]
You need to go
Don't look so surprised
Cause we had love
That won't be immortalized
Say you need me now
So lost without me now
But our little romance is through
Because basically, boy, you
You just don't know what to do, oh

[Verse 1: Wale]
I can give it to ya, but what you gonna do?
Win it if I hit it, I bet you stuck, stoop
But sucking your teeth, don't fuck up my mood
I'm trying to give it all to you
I can understand it's things we go through
Put C's on your bag, let's see this here through
And we can be receipts from Nobu
But I gotta get it out of you
She said "'le' throw a ring on it"
She don't love you unless she put your whole name on it
Gettin' money, yea this age is hard
Not the datin', I act a way
When all the pretty girls love you for your stage presence

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I miss you almost half as much as you miss me
You used to act so tough, for your insecurity
Now that I found myself, you're aching to be mine
Can't even help yourself from playing the fool this time

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Ooo, how I loved you
Ooo, how I needed you
Ooo, boy I feel brand new
Ooo, since you turned me lose
Baby, you don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
Cause you wanna leave
And you never go
I'mma set you free, boy
Baby, you don't know
You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey]
You love me more than you love sunny summer days
And even more than you love floating in a haze
Boy when you lost my heart, you lost everything
Now all that you can do is listen to me sing

[Chorus: Mariah]
Ooo, how I loved you (how I loved you boy)
Ooo, how I needed you
Ooo, boy I feel brand new
Ooo, since you turned me lose
You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
Cause you wanna leave
And you never go
I'mma set you free
Baby, you don't know
You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

[Verse 4: Wale]
I can give it to you, but what you gon' do
Win it, if I hit it, I bet you stuck, stoop
And the motto I got, no class in this school
Take your bags and go boo
Never mind all of the flexin' I do
Balenciagas, got you two steppin' on smooth
Never will I lower my standards, my boo
I could show you we’re at tennis like Sampras on cue
That’s kinda funny cause love still means lose
Unless we kill a racquet in back-and-forth moves
Somehow you keep showing yo Agassi do it
Did you catch that all, screw it
All the girls need is respect and I do it
Never catch feelings cause jets is my fuel
Giuseppe my foot, my sweats be D'Honneur
So sexy, they ain't sweating me, bet you ain't know her!

[Chorus]
You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do
Cause you wanna leave
And you never go
I'mma set you free
Baby, you don't know
You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what  to do
You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what  to do

[Outro]
You don't know you do to me
You don't know you do to me
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know you do to me
You don't know you do to me
You don't know
You don't know
Said you don't know
You don't know
