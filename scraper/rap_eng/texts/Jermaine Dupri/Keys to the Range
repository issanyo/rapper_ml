[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
What what happened to the girl I used to know
What what happened to the girl I used to know

[Chorus: Jagged Edge]
You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, the keys to the range
You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, the keys to the range

[Verse 1: Jagged Edge]
(What what happened to the girl I used to know)
Say what the dealey yo?
Said uh, won't you tell me sumthin I really know
Do you got plans to be with me
Then why'd you flip the script on me
I need to know if you're the one
I can take around the world
So tell, me tell me, tell me, baby
Baby do you changed

[Chorus: Jagged Edge]
You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, the keys to the range
You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, the keys to the range

[Verse 2: Jagged Edge]
I know you're feeling low
Now that you're thinking about the thing that you let go
I know you're mad but uh
I'm kinda glad cuz uh
Look what you had and you still let it go to waste
Baby, I should not be happy
I lost what I thought was close to me
I should have known that you're not right for me

[Chorus: Jagged Edge]
You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, the keys to the range
You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, the keys to the range

[Bridge: Jagged Edge]
I can't believe
Just when I thought you had me
Then you turned around changed the game on me
Now that I see
You've gotta put the work in, the work in
If you wanna be with me

[Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri]
All I remember was a relationship that was hot and strong
Please, I need you to tell me where it all went wrong
Now was it my friends or your friends
Or was it the fact that you received a Jag' when you wanted a Benz
Sound crazy? I've seen hang-ups like that
I mean shit, something made you change up like that
I used to bang out your back, so no way in hell
I kept you with a stack so I know good and well
You never missed a meal and got everything you dreamed
Had me like, 'it's for real', 'bout to jump you a ring
White 10 carats and nothing but bling-bling
And the right to tell me not to hit the scene
You wanna give that up?
What is it?  Do I work too much?
Did the playa just lose his touch?
I mean, it can't be that, I'm just shootin' out things
I thought you was the one, but damn you changed

[Chorus: Jagged Edge]
You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, the keys to the range
You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, the keys to the range
