[J.D.]
SoSoDef (what?)
Huh, yeah I don't dance ... I mash
(It's like dis doe)
AZ, come on

[AZ the Visualiza]
It's a new one, time for a Range, baby blue one
The crew won, out of formilli, feel I'm due one
Focus right, one hit -- blow me overnight
Holy mics, bein guarded -- by Jehovah's light
Jewels drapin, in a Coupe slidin cruise tape in
For my troops I was sworn in like a true Mason (yeah)
Tables turned, left the youth engaged and learned
Thoughts raised concern just like blunts made to burn
I play this life, homey besides on the status
Either play it right, or then vibe until the madness
Monopolize, position wise watch the rise
It's prophesized, see the two and drop fives

Chorus: Jermaine Dupri

Erybody hands up, AZ and JD
Whole club get it krunk, the drinks is on me
I keep the dancefloor lit, ladies shakin they hips
Spendin all the chips makin nuttin but hits, what?
(A, Z, play my song
Rock me all night long, rock me all night long)

[AZ the Visualiza]
Salute me, rock silk and linen over Gucci's
Iced out, platinum Roley -- with the rubies
Baby uzis, Perrier make me woozy
Sweet jacuzzi, it's live my life like a movie
Connect doe, pimped off the Henny X-O
Sex slow, *fuck* on Chanel velcro (ha ha ha)
Visualize that, bought a sailboat, try and buy that
Besides that, hustle forever -- never sidetracked
Sightseein, pretty ladies in the white B.M
Out of state plates invitin me in
Got my mind on this paper chase -- sorta strung
No longer gotta scrape the plate -- it's more to come
Respect how these streets made me -- why play me
I'm half crazy - half Marines, half Navy
So who it be? You or me, ten a key
Intensively, I know you players envy me

Chorus

[JD] C'mon

[AZ the Visualiza]
Come mingle with the illest minds, of mankind
Taught to shine, built out of crew and crime
Respect squares, straight shots burn your chest hairs
Chancin black, wish I had less shares
It's like a roller coaster, street life'll comatose ya
Cologne's kosher, a man's own is through his culture
Trapped in the arms of Satan, congregatin
Conversatin, thoughts way beyond relation
It's truth or deal, chose ones move sincere
Keep the youth aware, Supreme Court -- the proof is here

Chorus

[Jermaine Dupri]
Ha ha, now everybody in the house just
Clap your hands, uh, clap your hands
Uh, stomp your feet, uh-uh-uh, stomp your feet
Just, clap your hands, uh-huh, clap your hands
Uh, stomp your feet... AZ and J.D
