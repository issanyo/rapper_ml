[Intro: Damian Marley & (Jermaine Dupri)]
2008, watch it! Yeah!
Yo, Mariah Carey alongside Gong Marley
Huh, natty, check it, pepper!
(Y'all know what this is)

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
Can't get him outta my mind
Can't explain it, but it's somethin 'bout him makin' me high
Like a motor revin' over and over, it don't stop
He cruised beside me, now I'm flyin', drivin'
Through yellow lights
I'm ignorin' every sign of caution that they provide
Driver's Education 101 slipped out of my mind
I need me a caddy with some cruise control
No, no, no

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
But, oh-oh, I can't resist him
Just wanna kiss him
I need cruise control

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Might needa go slow
I don't know why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah, I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night
He's cruisin' through my brain
Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, uh, he so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't wanna lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
Can't nobody, can't nobody tell me nothin'
When he comes in to view
'Cause he's the flyest ting when he be cruisin' on me avenue
Then da door open, de gals 'pon de block
They be hopin, to rob the clock me say "No, man"
Step up, step up bottle broken
Think I'm jokin'

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
But, oh-oh, I can't resist him
Just wanna kiss him
I need cruise control

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Might needa go slow
I don't know why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah, I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night
He's cruisin' through my brain
Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, uh, he so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't wanna lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control

[Bridge: Damian Marley]
You put your hand in cruise control
And you deny me if you want
And you will starve yourself of love
If you don't speed and break the law
You can't get no speeding ticket
On the highway to my heart
And it might be a rocky road
And you can exit if you want (Why you always?)
Look at life just like a pessimist
You already like a wife up in my premises
And right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis
Just come again and stop and start just like a genesis

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Might needa go slow
I don't know why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah, I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night
He's cruisin' through my brain
Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, uh, he so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't wanna lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control
