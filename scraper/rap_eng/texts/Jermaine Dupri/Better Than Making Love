[Intro]
You look good
You smell good
You know what I want
I like that
Get closer

[Verse 1]
If something feels better
I wanna know about it
If you know what it is
Baby, tell me about it
This feeling's so beautiful
No words can describe it
But I want it all the time
Now that I've tried it

[Chorus]
Baby, this love you're giving me
This feeling so good, I can't let go
It's got me needing you, wanting you
And nothing could be better
Better than making sweet love
'Cause that's how I'm feel when I'm in love
Nothing compares when it's real love
That's how I feel when I'm making love
Nothing is better than...

[Verse 2]
Melting in your arms
Is probably my favorite scene
Of us in this masterpiece that we created
See you keep me inspired, ooh
When it comes to love
Keep me excited, I just can't enough

[Chorus]
Baby, this love you're giving me
This feeling so good I can't let go
It's got me needing you, wanting you
And nothing could be better
Better than making sweet love
'Cause that's how I'm feel when I'm in love
Nothing compares when it's real love
That's how I feel when I'm making love
Nothing is better than...

[Bridge]
Our love, 'cause it's on another level
Nothing else can measure up to how I feel
When this love we share
When I sit down and compare
Couldn't find that anywhere
When I am with you, oh
And we're making love, making love
And we're making love

[Chorus]
Baby, this love you're giving me
Baby, this love you're giving me
This feeling so good I can't let go
This feeling so good I can't let go
I just can't get enough
It's got me needing you, wanting you
And nothing could be better
Better than making sweet love
'Cause that's how I'm feel when I'm in love
Nothing compares when it's real love
That's how I feel when I'm making love
Nothing is better than our love
Nothing is better than our love
