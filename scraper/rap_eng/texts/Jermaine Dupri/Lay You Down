[Female]
Um, this Don Chi Chi person that you call yourself?

[JD]
Uh huh

[Female]
What is he all about?
Does that mean that you could be devoted to one woman
And have others, or does that mean you're not devoted at all?

[JD]
Don Chi Chi basically is a glamorous
Fly-assed playboy that's just, you know
He ain't no one-woman type man

[JD]
I can't wait
It's me again
Uh, what chu waitin' for?
Trina and Tammy, So So Def, c'mon

[Trina & Tammy]
1 - Why don't you and me
Take a trip and dip back to my crib
I wanna lay you down
I really wanna lay you down

Here we are alone in my car
And I can feel your temperature rising
You want me, I want you, too
And I can see it in your eyes that you're ready (Ready)
To hit the back seat of my Jeep right now
If the mood ain't right, my Jeep is tight
I got a better place to lay you down

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

I said, "Baby" (Baby)
Before we lay, everything's gotta be just right
Cuz tonight is the night I've been waiting for
You and me are about to take flight, yeah, yeah
I don't want no distractions
Once we get into our action
I wanna be alone (That's right)
Getting it on all night long

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Oh, baby
(Baby come this way)
(No longer will I make you wait)
I can feel your passion rising
And you're not alone
(My heart)
My heart
(Is yearning for your love)
I can hardly wait to lay you down
Down
(Why don't you)

[JD]
What you waitin' for
Let the freak show begin
Let the freak show begin
Let the freak show begin

What you waitin' for
Let the freak show begin
Let the freak show begin
Let the freak show begin
(Why don't you)

What you waitin' for
Let the freak show begin
Let the freak show begin
Let the freak show begin

What you waitin' for
Let the freak show begin
Let the freak show begin
Let the freak show begin
You heard me?

[Trina & Tamara]
First destination
(Is my heart)
Second destination
(After the lights go out)
I kindly get you up and take you to my place
Town of ecstasy
I don't think it can wait

First destination
(Is my heart)
Second destination
(After the lights go out)
I'm gonna make you wish
That everyday you live
That you could spend your life with me (Yeah)

Repeat 1 until fade
