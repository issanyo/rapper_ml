Okay we get it, okay okay you out here and getting it
Okay we get it, okay okay enough already, peep the lyrics;
Everybody’s hard, everybody sells hard
Everybody’s life was hard, no dad, single mom;
In the hood, not a single job was the prob
Your excuse is like an EBT card that everybody got;
I’m a racist homophobe, no different from ya’ folks
I say it in public, you say behind it closed doors;
You accept everything, I don’t fall for the okie dokes
Ain’t nothing change for blacks, that’s the last time I ever vote;
Imagine if Obama really cared about issues other than homosexual affairs
First black in that chair and this is how they gon’ define his presidential career;
Comparing gays struggles to blacks, get the F out of here;
You ashamed of your age so you act accordingly
To what they perceive is young, dumb, and unorderly;
You record everything, but don’t call that snitching
Listen that’s what it is when you sharing illegal information;
Without  the participant’s permission, is nothing forbidden
No cameras, no vision, I thought that rule was unwritten;
This is politically incorrect, correct I’m  no politician


Verse 2

When Em talks about drugs, he sells, us we get convictions;
Macklemore and Ryan Lewis sells, us we just spittin’
They’ll buy what you say when free download is in the description;
Now tell me that’s fiction, the truth’s the new lie
The booth’s the new copout, the youth won’t open eyes;
I’m an artist, you a rapper, I paint pictures, you snap em’
Leave authority’s to imagine while you Instagram after;
This my lyrical “Twitter hack”, still rock a fitted cap
So proud to be my own man, don’t tell me when to snapback;
3 cuts in your eyebrows with the high top fades
Hate the old school, but steal what they did back in the days;
The music and the fashion, then act like innovators
Everything’s coming back even Hammer and his activator;
Still talk like the “East/West Coast Beef” was yesterday
So sorry little homie, you 17 years late;
Time to move on, put ya’ own shoes on
Social media got a million of you Jimmie Neutrons’;
“If that was me”, but it ain’t you
Trolling posting craziness, ain’t that what you saints do?
Playing all your 52 cards in the deck
Talking bout, “they ain’t hire me cause of the tat on your neck”;
Or better yet cause you gay or you black, cause you a chick
This country was built off discrimination, what the F you expect?
1 month to learn our history, 11 to share theirs
The elephant and the donkey both want you unaware;


Chorus

Hell yea
The American HipHopcrisy…
The elephant and the donkey both want you unaware:
Hell yea
The American HipHopcrisy…
The elephant and the donkey both want you unaware:
Hell yea
The American HipHopcrisy…
The elephant and the donkey both want you unaware:
Hell yea
The American HipHopcrisy…
The elephant and the donkey both want you unaware:
Aight let me hear that back
