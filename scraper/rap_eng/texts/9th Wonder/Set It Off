Part 1
[Verse 1]
This is the moment you’ve been waiting for
Flow cold, nigga what you skatin’ on?
Hot as hell, I could make you feel like you in Satan’s home
Locks on the locks, drops for my drops
Who I’m s’possed to call? I need cops for the cops
FTP these pigs can't kill me
Still so sick, no pill can heal me
Me no run, one test and feel free
I paint saints gone in the wind, I drew breeze
We be in the league, city under siege
Ain’t no competition, yea I’m in another league
I feel for all who’s tryna keep up with me
You get dragged so much you could date Mister Cee
Songs that I write, wrongs and the rights
All so dope, you could sell it to the hypes
Picture worth a thousand words, blind sayin’ “what a sight”
Add kill the verse, girls say I give ‘em life

[Hook]
Go ahead, get ‘em up, where we at? In the cut
Bet it once, bet it twice, shut it down, shut ‘em up
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, set it off
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, set it off
Go ahead, get ‘em up, where we at? In the cut
Bet it once, bet it twice, shut it down, shut ‘em up
Set it off (set it off) set it off (set it off)
Set it off (set it off) set it off (set it off)

[Verse 2]
Yo, hate to pop your balloon
But your favourite rapper’s a coon
You hear the things that he spit?
Well really if he keep it real, then really then he like a snitch, right?
Rappers that you praise and the ones that you put your faith in
I listen to their verses and it sound like an affidavit
I be losin’ my patience like doctors that couldn’t save theirs
Came into this game, they complainin’ that I don’t play fair
We be bringin’ rides to your hood like it was a state fair
Wait there, spittin’ all this dope you swore there’s weight there
Say you paintin’ pictures, I’m lookin’ at you with blank stares
You ain’t killin’ nothin’, your verses just learned to play dead
Pop, pop, lights out, bet they wild out
Put ‘em in a hole they can’t climb out
Tell your coach call a time-out
I be goin’ dumb, dumb, dumb like my mind out

[Hook]
Go ahead, get ‘em up, where we at? In the cut
Bet it once, bet it twice, shut it down, shut ‘em up
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 set it off
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 set it off
Go ahead, get ‘em up, where we at? In the cut
Bet it once, bet it twice, shut it down, shut ‘em up
Set it off (set it off) set it off (set it off)
Set it off (set it off) set it off (set it off)

[Verse 3]
They givin’ cats wings for a pair of fly shoes
Better find God ‘fore them bullets find you
Shooters takin' shots like an alcoholic looter
Takin’ out them young men, them guns like cougars
Somebody tell the radio I’m here to free the slaves
Tell your television yea, I'm here to free the slaves
Better know that man great, haters can’t stand me
I’m sayin’ “psssh” like Will and Jazz’s handshake
Fans want that feelin’ of that Tribe Called Quest
And still miss the feelin’ of that guy called West
Well tell 'em church back, stayin' on my job watch me work that
Hungry, I don’t have time for the thirst track
Fuck rap, this a manifesto for the black man
Rollin' in the whip, whippin' master with the left hand
Southside Chi-Town, my town, ride hol' up
Like a hold up, hands up, high, high

[Hook]
Go ahead, get ‘em up, where we at? In the cut
Bet it once, bet it twice, shut it down, shut ‘em up
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 set it off
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 set it off
Go ahead, get ‘em up, where we at? In the cut
Bet it once, bet it twice, shut it down, shut ‘em up
Set it off (set it off) set it off (set it off)
Set it off (set it off) set it off (set it off)
Go ahead, get ‘em up, where we at? In the cut
Bet it once, bet it twice, shut it down, shut ‘em up
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 set it off
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 set it off
Go ahead, get ‘em up, where we at? In the cut
Bet it once, bet it twice, shut it down, shut ‘em up
Set it off (set it off) set it off (set it off)
Set it off (set it off) set it off (set it off)

Part 2
The kid workin’ like child labor
Rarely see my face like the neighbor of Tim Taylor
The prodigal son probly the product what sin made us
A problem that’s been major, I’m big baby, like Glen Davis
You dictators are dick takers, when Add spittin’ that shit
It’s stronger than Vick’s Vapor
I’m killin’ all of your dogs, call it a Vick favor
No shots to chasers, we are stayin’ where the shots chase us
May God save us
I’m pourin’ liquor for rappers, heard your verse and I’m laughin’
Hit the track and I’m lappin’, you niggas talk about fashion
You need to come out the closet like hangers, can’t hang with us
Fake bitches and money’s all that the fame get us
Gettin’ all in your feelings, you better call you a dentist
You know the drill, niggas ain’t fuckin’ with us
On spacebars, you push keys, see there’s a big difference
A deaf man told me, homie, niggas never listen
A project got flows, this shit is just like a tenement
Put it out on the street, like it ain’t pay the rent
Should I stay militant or try to break the glass where the ceiling is?
A catch 22, catching Emmitt Smith, nigga that’s the realest shit
The lines needed, but the hooks is what’s reelin’ in
I got it from my aunt when we was fishing
It works for this rap world I’m livin’ in
Swimmin’ in sin, how can you drown without stepping foot in the water?
Pardon while I part it like a barber makin’ cuts, like a coach nigga
See my approach nigga? Think we close then I’m ghost nigga
Nigga, they jaws dropping, no scissors, paper, I still rock ‘em
The door closed, no car locking
Nigga my flow clean so stop mopping
Drunk with power, go off a bar like we bar hoppin’, nigga
I’m from a place where they throw bullets and catch cases
Thirty livin’ with moms, playin’ a PlayStation
In the basement, my homie ask “When you get famous
What you doin?” I told him “fucking Sanaa Lathan”
He told me “Homie keep your head up, never let up
Chase dreams, not the cheddar, fuck the setup
Watch these niggas that you should be ahead of
Money ain’t everything, it could make it better”
Keep it in perspective, niggas make records breakin’ records
Changin’ then they stay reckless
Remember as a shorty lookin’ up to the niggas on the radio
Now I’m gettin’ older and I’m wonderin’ where the hell they go
Step inside the booth, sad truth for the day
Is either you a legend or you fade, nigga
Either you a legend or you fade (or you fade, or you fade…)

[Outro]
When you come from nothing and have nothing
You value everything that you don’t have
