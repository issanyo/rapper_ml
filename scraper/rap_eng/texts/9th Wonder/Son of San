[Intro]
Welcome..
Everybody..
To the Son of San..
S. O. S..

[Verse One]
A dog told me to kill MCs
Thought you could hold me
Feel me
No anesthetic
You so anorexic
I got that phat shit
Dark nights
I got that bat shit
When I see the Justus League emblem
Fuck wit me I'm fencing
Wit a mask lid on ??
John Leguizamo
Who wanna test Billy Blanco
From tha Nom
Who want tha drama
Day time Emmys
I trace lines plenty
Add up to make shapes
I put ma raps up against the greats
No comparisons
Flows are rare as when concocted
From one cockpit
9th the copilot we take you on flights
That solo wild shit
The amount of X-files hid
No Scully
S.O.S don't touch me
Don't touch me

[Hook]
Turn ma mic up like this much
Burn ma life up in this dutch
Shit ya'll please understand
It's hard to be the Son of San
Turn ma mic up like this much
Burn ma life up in this dutch
Shit ya'll please understand
It's hard to be the Son of San
It's hard to be the Son of San
Son of San, Son of San, Son of San(fades away)

[Verse Two]
Fresh outta hibernation
Fresh outta time waiting
Took a long rest tryna keep the evil off me
In the process some of ma people crossed me
But still I got you
I was drunk as a worm in a tequila bottle
Like fuck it when I hit the scene
Accepted by tha public cuz of ma ill nigga genes
I'm not into glitz and glam
I'm tryna lift ma fam
Eat better and speak better
Basic conversations
Chasing domination
Build an angry mob
We'll break the law
Still pray to god
Similar to repents
From the heart spillin the contents
All of it
An it ain't all love shit
Hurt feelings an reverse killing
Son of San, Son of San, Son of San(fades away)

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
See the rapid fires
Speak with mad desire
I got up from hot fucks
Truly yo
Then popped up in the studios
Raring to go
Last minute
Preparing for shows
Thinking we too good to rehearse or practice
I think we too hood dirty mattress
Blotched as denji??
Dog shit like Benji
Gave you 'More'
Drop the Demi
Don't care what you say say bitch
We Bebes Kids don't lie
I slow ride
I70
So high I'm Heavenly
The Heavenly Kid
The Legacy shit is so hard to teach
Gotta love that
I'm hard to reach
Gotta clutch that
It took all of me to stop fuckin rap
But she's diseased now
Sickly when she free style
I Aaron Hall miss her
Wanted to tongue kiss her
Wanted to feel her
Never thought I'd be the one to kill her..

[Hook]
