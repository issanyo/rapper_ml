[Verse 1: Joey Mac]
Being greater is my motivator
Talking money with the team people nomenclature
If no on hates ya, you ain't on ya job
Grind and watch the your haters fill up an amphitheater
And while you doing that, I'll be doing Mac
Like sex with an ATM, I'll be producing facts (fax)
Quadruple entendre. Wordplay cray, new flow bonkers
Growing up, all I had was my mamma
Pop cut checks but QT he wasn't fond of
Me? I was kinda just tryna get my mines up
Not knowing what's ahead, I'm just tryna get a line up
And now my grinds up and I'm living life
Same routine. Just a different night
Popping bottles with the team cause the cash
And all the models flood the scene...

[Hook: Gone Wallace]
Cause that's us
Don't disrespect the team cause we do what we must
Success by any means in the midst of a rush
Ain't always what it seems but we living it up now what up
(Get ya own style, nigga)

And that's us
Don't disrespect the team cause we do what we must
Success by any means in the midst of a rush
Ain't always what it seems but we living it up now what up

[Verse 2: Gone Wallace]
Unrecognizable style, potent I spit poison without an antidote
We young and we living it we deserve a toast
This nigga's so arrogant all he do is boast
I ain't boasting I'm dead serious
Nigga I'm cold blooded. That nigga in summer rocking a winter coat
While I'm looking to earn the most
These niggas wanting the newest Foams
So depressed as an adolescent
Momma struggling to get me everything I requested to no avail
I wake up everyday missing something I know it well
The realest nigga with superheroes on his lapel
Who else you know could deal with this life?
I been through hell and back using lyrics as mechanisms its automatic
Dreams of living in a position that's more than lavish
Designers fabrics that's so elaborate
A nigga painting pictures something vicious they cinematic
I know I had to get em shit I tried to be diplomatic
I let em have it and that's us

[Hook: Gone Wallace]
And that's us
Don't disrespect the team cause we do what we must
Success by any means in the midst of a rush
Ain't always what it seems but we living it up now what up
(Get ya own style, nigga)

And that's us
Don't disrespect the team cause we do what we must
Success by any means in the midst of a rush
Ain't always what it seems but we living it up now what up
