[Intro: Big Boi]
Eastpoint
College Park sucker
Decatur for your hatin' ass
See you later

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Sweet Daddy showed us how to rock a mink
I got to thinking and now I got these alligators on my feet
I’m so distinguished, the one of the meanest, clean but very private
My wife's at home with my children, it's a silent
Night like the temptations was singin on sight
But I'm tempted to put the PVC pipe in her life, right?
Those are plumbing terms so tea time my little hummingbird
Cunning words uttered while I'm touching her
And now she’s beggin' for a nigga to go 'n' get up in her
Like the holy ghost, destination molly world
So I propose a toast, Crown Black and apple juice
It's all about that crown, life no clown life for attitudes
Well unless it's Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, or Eazy
Cause I'mma be your nigga for life, please believe me
It’s just your friendly neighborhood Daddy Fat
From Decatur to East Point my name good and that’s that

[Hook: Sarah Barthel]
She’s just a liar who gets high on rock 'n' roll
A rolling stone, drugs and hoes
She don’t know, she just knows
That I put it on her (shawty get the tool out, shawty pimp got the tool out)
I put it on her (i’m psyched out with it by now)

[Verse 2: Josh Carter]
I’m the producer extraordinaire
I’ll eat beat machines, put my stick on your snare
I like a landing strip or like it bare
Good shit and good shit we get anywhere
Shape like a peach or a pear
Will I put it on you? Hell yeah
Try me little lady, I'll put it in you
Put it on you, the performer of performers
Producer of producers
This is not what you're used to
So taste like fruit juice
When I cum it's youthful
JMC certified, damn take a spoonful

[Hook: Sarah Barthel]
She’s just a liar who gets high on rock 'n' roll
A rolling stone, drugs and hoes
She don’t know, she just knows
That I put it on her (shawty get the tool out, shawty pimp got the tool out)
I put it on her (i’m psyched out with it by now)
