Intro [Jean Grae]
Aye 9th, you know me and Phonte the Ashford and Simpson of this rap shit
Y'all ain't know
Oh, y'all ain't know
Oh, we creeping up like.. da na na na na

[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
It's Jean niggas, back again
Trap you in the wrath again
Blacker than boat loads of Africans
Or rather like them
This struggle, we can't win
Back bent, over till it slacks, and cracks
Can't hustle harder
I'm like my father
Only in denial though
My mother is like "I know"
And my brother is quiet so
I fight further
Till I type murder, family cycles and fly further than expected
Titles on my life or daughter
Sorta like a boarder
Still in my momma's house
Get green like chlorophyll and all of y'all be like, "I'm out"
Gettin' your own shit
Shittin' in your own crib
I'm in no position to be fucking on my own still
This ain't some words on a paper
This is what my mind's made of
Emotional heart data
Like a skyscraper reaching up
Try to stay keeping up and trying to keep my feelings out of the beats and stuff
But Tay, they ain't believe in us

[Hook]
Been through so many struggles in my life
You would not believe where I have been
(I don't know where, I don't know how)
Even my lonely heart and sacrifice
Until the day that my life ends
(The place is here, the time is now)

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Now at this moment
Phonte's flow is
Stomping through
Y'all niggas just tip toeing
Soon as they put it on
They say, he's big Willie
You just a Lil' Jon
Trying to get lower
This is proof that thee existence of persistence pays off and it's showing
Cause labels used to play me like
Now they better pay me like I'm Luke Wilson
Check your books, I ain't owing
Tay's a true terror
Y'all ain't busting caps
Y'all gangstas in the studio making a new era
And this is for whoever
Is trying to do me
Y'all need to do you, maybe then you'll do better
Cause I'm gonna be spitting till I walk with a cane
Left my mark on the game
And y'all just scribbling
I'm etched in stone, y'all just penciled in
Number two status, that's your place nigga, live with it

[Jean Grae]
They don't know the shoes I walk in
So I guess they'll keep on talking

[Hook] [x2]

[Outro]
[Phonte]
We gon' build it up, build it up, build it up
And now we're solid
Solid as a rock

[Jean Grae]
It's solid, it's solid
You'll know, you'll
Cos when you hold that thing in your hand and you know it's solid
It's not a liquid, it's not a gas, it's solid, it's solid, let me tell ya again
Solid, solid
So solid
It's what we got, what we got, what we got
Can I have some cake? Is the cake solid?
It's solid cake, it's vanilla solid cake baby

[Phonte]
And it's got icing on it!

[Jean Grae]
Icing on the cake! It's got icing on the cake!
Now ain't that the best thing you ever heard
