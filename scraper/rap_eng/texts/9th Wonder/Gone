[Hook]
Gone to love another
And now gone a little further you're gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah you're gone
You're gone, yeah, yeah you're gone

[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
How could I not have seen this coming
Not even a feeling, something
A warning sign
Cause this beyond some borderline fronting
Hysterical blindness
Straight staring at eyelids
Face buried in the closet now
I'll burn this bitch down
Think fast, then exhale
Nigga turn your shit round
Face me, explain
You get the urge to spilt town
Gotta life, Pittsburgh, something I missed now
Pardon me, I'm perturbed
I'm cool
I'll sit
How many times you been with her
How's the sex, similar
Nah, probably if it was you wouldn't be hitting her
Dumb question, right
So listen, got advice
What'd you do in my position
In the kitchen there's a knife
Don't worry bout the blood, I'll only stick you twice
In the heart then the jugular shit
I'm your wife you little fucker
Damn, my mother was right
I grab the burner then I (blocka, blocka)
Say goodnight you sucka

[Hook]

[Jean Grae]
Rock-a-bye baby

[Verse 2: Chaundon]
Shit, bitch why you shoot me
Goddamn, I'm bleeding profusely
Hold on, wait a minute
Let me talk
Put the fucking gun down I'll tell you what's up
There's a lot of things going on that you wasn't telling me
I'm insecure so of course that lead to infidelity
Too many male friends
Everybody calling you
2am, 3am, what the fuck is wrong with you
And you expect me to stand here faithful
You don't respect me, bitch I hate you
And for the record her pussy was wetter
Gave head better, made more cheddar
Shoulda packed my bags when I had the chance
But I got greedy hoped you save the last dance
But fuck it
It is what it is, oh well
Bitch I wish you ill
I'll see you in hell

[Hook]
