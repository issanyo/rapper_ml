[Chorus: Courtney]
Gots to get away (4x)

[Verse 1: J Gunn]
You don't really want to stay, 'cause I'm looking at your face
And it's telling me J, please find me and exit out this place
Cause these lame dudes been up in your face all night
Hair-do tight. Make-up done right
Smile just like sunlight. And that's real
I'm thinking maybe we can find a place where we can chill
You laugh cause I'm acting too fast don't get mad
Just relax. We'll get past all of that. All I'm asking asking is for
You to roll. Enjoy the air that we breathe
Maybe slide down the beach inhale the breeze from the sea
You see, I been in the spot just as long as you
But it's just something in your eyes like I'm just drawn to you
Now baby I just want to ride, throw your cares away
Allow the music to alleviate the stress of your day
And get away, because we're young and we can't live twice
Relax and be free, if only for one night

[Chorus]
Baby girl, what you think about riding wit me (seat back)
Just relax, let your mind be free (and get away!)
From everything that's bringing you down
So, we gots to get away
So, We gots to get away, aye!

[Chorus: Courtney]
Baby, let's roll. Come chill with me
Let's take a ride and just be free
I need someone to ease my mind
So we gots to get away

[Verse 2: ]
So we chilling at this party, trying to ease my mind. She saw me
Kinda caught me off guard, knew she want me
So I approach mami calmly, said I'm sorry
My day's been stressed-filled, and I'm not asking for sex
I just want to chill, plus your body banging and I'm feeling your vibe
I want to know how you feel inside
Conversation while I chill and drive, take it slow
Our relation will we build in time
But until then, I'm just trying to relax, kick back and kill time
And get away, from the stress in my day
Plus you looking tired and I know you don't want to stay
So let's say we get away, let's start leaving
Even if it's for this one evening
And I can see when you're looking at me
It's no secret. We both need it
I'mma stop speaking, let the moment creep in
Baby girl, we need to get away. Believe it

[Chorus
Baby girl, what you think about riding wit me (seat back)
Just relax, let your mind be free (and get away!)
From everything that's bringing you down
So, we gots to get away
So, We gots to get away, aye!

[Chorus: Courtney]
Baby, let's roll. Come chill with me
Let's take a ride and just be free
I need someone to ease my mind
So we gots to get away

[Verse 3]
Honey dip, I can be what you need tonight
I saw you staring, it's apparent that you want me, right
Don't act all shy, so come here. Whisper in your ear sweet things
Let them weed stunting niggas buy you diamond rings
Cause I'm broke. Not about material things
But I can bring you happiness. For real, we can practice this
So I insist [?] right now
That you please come with me, cause I'm feeling your style
I know you'd rather be at a movie up at jacuzzi's
Or on top of me you gotta be more than a groupie
She said fo'sho, now we hitting the exit
Staring hard at this shorty, gotta see you naked
Typical man, right? But I'm not at all
The type to never give plenty loot for the mall
Now we in the parking lot as we hop in my car
Trying to get away. Let's get away

[Chorus]
Baby girl, what you think about riding wit me (seat back)
Just relax, let your mind be free (and get away!)
From everything that's bringing you down
So, we gots to get away
So, We gots to get away, aye!
