[Verse 1]
Never think, just read
Said the teacher man
Don't love who you wanna
Said the preacher man
Roll it up, roll it up
Said the reefer man
Time is gold, time is money
Said the reaper man
So now they got me with my
Nose in a book
Heart in a noose
Blunt in my hand
Time with a keeper man
Finally wise enough to
Widen up my eyelids
And keep a pair of shades
To fade the ultra violets
Yall couldn't touch me
Like the pope to a nine
I hope to rewind
Back so I can open ya mind
And fly back to the future
With my notes and a rhyme
Me and a track is like
Coke to a line
Simple requirement
Force me into retirement
I am an iambic
Contaminant with the rhymes
I'm in the building
The shape of a pentagon
With an afghani fan
Who's telling me I'm the bomb
Game on

[Verse 2]
Pops taught me things
I couldn't learn on my own
So I rock his snapbacks
Like I'm rocking my own
Could give a what about
A couple bucks, crumple em up
Lacerations saturated
Keep the truth in my cup
Failing classes like they
Taught me to
Go to school to learn my lesson
Lesson learned, now I'm directing
Like I bought the news
Love is blind, I couldn't
See through the smoke
So I rolled up with this verse
Because she needed a smoke
Then I passed it on to lower
Cuz they needed a lift
Classic passed it right back
And said I needed a hit
Because the bars are
Straight dopamine
Doper than a coping fiend
Hopeless brothers hope to dream
Ain't been this close to
Hopeless dreams
Hip Hop is here
Hip Hop's alive
As long as I rhyme
Hip Hop will strive
As long as there's truth
Hip Hop will lie
And I'll be lying with it
Till the day that I die
