[Intro]
Listen up, listen up, uh
Ain't no comparing me to you
You know what I'm sayin'
There is only one me [?]
Stick on what you do, stay original, listen up

[Hook]
Ain't no comparison, that's embarrassing
If ya wanna be like me
Buck the B.D. E.Y.E
If ya try to see what I see
Then I see that you are not me
Ain't no comparison, that's embarrassing
If ya tryin' be like me
Buck the B.D. E.Y.E
If ya wanna to see what I see
Then I see that you are not me

[Verse 1]
I'm the smallest dog in the corner, wouldn't back down
Got bit but never quit, I'm back strapped now
I'm the link to the Carter, fuck the crack now
A lawyer on the case who blew trial and got the facts now
Now, settle down
I'm the hot water in ya kettle now
2005 black rebel now
I'm the trouble in ya child, nothing's allowed
I'm the only individual running this now
Running ya mouth will get ya results
Homie if I go for ya throat, believe it's ya fault
I tried to warn you and I tried to tell you, son was no joke
He wouldn't listen so my mission is to go for broke, to show you

[Hook]
Ain't no comparison, that's embarrassing
If ya wanna be like me
Buck the B.D. E.Y.E
If ya try to see what I see
Then I see that you are not me
Ain't no comparison, that's embarrassing
If ya tryin' be like me
Buck the B.D. E.Y.E
If ya wanna to see what I see
Then I see that you are not me

[Verse 2]
I'm [?] against a K-9
A grey butter knife to a grey nine
A Porsche 9-11 to an Alon
Homie with sight all his life, now today blind
Or money with life and he got a chance to hit state lines
I'm, Mike Tyson in his prime
45, stolen car, no license and just did a crime
I'm the man with the mastermind
For a scam and a hundred grand, ask po-nine
I'm the best when I'm at my worst
I'm the rest of the shells from the shottie now adjust, that hurts
Alcoholic in the liquor store going bezerk
We in a cell, that's an L son, I'm blowing it first, to show you

[Hook]
Ain't no comparison, that's embarrassing
If ya wanna be like me
Buck the B.D. E.Y.E
If ya try to see what I see
Then I see that you are not me
Ain't no comparison, that's embarrassing
If ya tryin' be like me
Buck the B.D. E.Y.E
If ya wanna to see what I see
Then I see that you are not me

[Outro]
You get one Buck
You get one Shot
You get one chance, two hands, one stop
There's only one me
There's only one you
So what you need to do is be original
