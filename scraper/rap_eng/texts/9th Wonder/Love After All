[Gwen Bunn]

I found love after all
Can’t believe that I found love, after all
The passion was lost, after all
The passion was lost
I found love after all

[Verse 1]

I miss my baby its lonely
Watching my Sony
Tryna clear my mind, calling my homies
Like what you doing today?
Can we ride?
Break out my fives
Go wherever just so I can survive
Tho love died
The recipe they told me to therapy was charity
Shopping, lunch dates, work overtime, Sara Lee
Tryna find the humor in life, make it a parody
But narrowly escaping my fall
Depression call
In the car sing along to the songs to make you cry
The side where you passenger ride, nobody ride
Thinking of the promises all broken
Pinkies untied
And it ultimately lead to divide, reading the vibes
You’d think somebody close to me died
Redder my eyes
Cherry pies, that's the color of pain
Color of rain
It was clear I was close to insane and unshamed
We’ve all felt the same
If you ain't then you ain't loved you
Through it all still no regrets
He learned from what he lost and I found perfection

[Verse 2]

I went from teary eyed to an appearance
That mirror present day new Simeon
Jabari the game
Triumph from tragedy
I Rose, gave love a new battery
Acid free
Corrosion we close in on the heart ache
Smooth as a parfait, we partake
Like Barclay
New beginnings, like Mona grinning in picture
Perfect, perfection Ive missed ya
What a mixture
You and I like cherry or apple pie, sweeter
Different from how them other lovers would treat her
Thankful for the day God sent you to meet her
Perfection is what I needed, for real

[Verse 3]

Damnit this love is good to me
Easy like a warm summer day up under a canopy
Swinging in a hammock
Im thankful I got my sanity
Been scarred, he kissed everyone and he told me
“damnit see, you’ll never have to fear me leaving
Give you all my honesty. And honestly, it wouldn’t
Be smart of me think I’m Condoleez. Know you my
Better half, if you’re the beauty then Im the beast”
On the long road and I told him no I ain't bout a lease
Kissed every scar that them subpars ever gave you
And he thinkin bout my future, baby behind my navel
We talking love and Hip Hop and no it ain't no cable
And I’m praying to the God above
Thanking him that he gave you, like
Preciate it, for putting me on this earth
Just to appreciate it, everything that he’s worth
We ain’t depreciating, he came to fix all the hurt
I found love again
Glad he came to cure every curse
