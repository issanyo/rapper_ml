[Verse 1: Big Pooh]
Aiyyo, what up Reese? It's been a minute since we last spoke
Side by side, in a circle round mad folks
We took it round each other wishing we were still close
But I'm grown and it's tough for you to swallow
I know it hit you hard when your boys hit you
And your letters, I never answered back to
Even though life keep me racing like a track dude
I bailed out in your time of need
But you fucked me over in your time of greed
We from the same womb, what happened to the creed?
An unspoken word between you and I
J-B's for life, we ain't supposed to cry
Remember after my first fight, we stayed up all night
Getting taught how to throw them thangs
If he defeat I, it's the force you bring
Harassing Kevin after lunch for about a week
How did we get to the point when we would hardly speak?
Pulling up to the house, fresh change of sneaks
Big buckets, pants stay tight from the big duckets
We all loved it, I was so naive
Big brother kept me smiling, tricks up his sleeve
Had me facing claves, cases and stacks of threes
My God, it ain't what it supposed to be
Barbeques, family and friends close to me

[Hook: Big Pooh and Phonte]
Aiyyo, I know we ain't spoke in a while
It's kinda foul cause a nigga getting older, ain't no time for you now
Wishing you was right here so I could hold you now
(You're so far away from me)
Aiyyo, I know we ain't spoke in a while
It's kinda foul, cause you getting older and now I'm missing your smile
And we went our separate ways, ain't no problems now
(You're so far away from me)
Cause one day we gon' still get down
We gon' still get down
Get-get-a-get-get down
Get-get-a-get-a-get-get down
Get to get, yo say, get to get down
One day we gon' still get down
(You're so far away from me)
Aiyyo, I know we ain't spoke in a while
It's kinda foul cause a nigga getting older, ain't no time for you now
Wishing you was right here so I could hold you now
Cause one day, we gon' still get down
(You're so far away from me)

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Check it, now what the deal baby? I'm still here, still crazy
I'm real sorry we ain't had a chance to chill lately
Or even talk as often now, congratulations
They telling me you almost walking now
Roads of life I'm crossing now
Can't wait to get you back to NC so we can all get down
And get real tight, have you dressed up rocking the ill Nikes
Show you what a father is supposed to feel like
It's been nights that I wake up thinking that I hear you
Back of my mind start feeling fearful
Thinking if the words I say are really getting to you
And when I hold you in my arms if my face look familiar to you
That shit is killing me dude, I pray that your eyes remember me
Black and white is all you can see in infancy
And eventually I'll have you on some comfortable shit
Two parent income, Claire and Cliff Huxtable shit
But right now it's all about this long distance
All I can do is get along with it, try and be strong with it
Fuck being long winded
Hearing you laugh is like music to my ears but the song ended
Me and your moms both missing your smile and all your silly faces
Even your hurl on our pillowcases
Goddamn it, this ain't how life supposed to be
Cause baby boy, you should be close to me, now run it down

[Hook]

[Outro: Phonte]
Yo, this one is for our peoples that is out there
We just want you to know y'all ain't forgot there
Oh yeah, we hearing y'all, and yeah, we feeling y'all
(You're so far away from me)
And yo, this one is for my peoples that is out there
And Little Dil and Little Jordan ain't forgot there
Oh yeah, we hearing y'all, and yeah, we feeling y'all
(You're so far away from me)
And yo, this one is for my peoples that is out there
Tyree R.I.P., you ain't forgot there
And yo, I'm hearing y'all, and yeah, we feeling y'all
(You're so far away from me)
