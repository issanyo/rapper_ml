[Verse One]:
And he told me no no no
You can't rap man
Look dummies integrated math class
Couldn't pass that
So I told the teacher lick the ass crack
I'm gonna do music
They laughed
Then fate stepped in
Refining my skills
Sharpening my pen
I got to get it in
If I'm gonna hit it big
And I was big hits everyday...Ripkin
Pow
Wow
Look at me now
Everybody else better throw in the towel
They used to style, frown, put me down
Now they see me at the mall and they give me pounds
What's that about?
Shoot, now I'm hearin' chatter 'bout
Tom's got a deal and a talent scout
I'm happy now
I got some things to be happy about
Plus big dreams that I'm mapping out

[Chorus:]
They said I couldn't do it
I said I would, I did it
And now my biggest critics
Are saying I finna get it
They said I couldn't do it
I said I would, I did it
And now my biggest critics
Are saying I finna get it
I'm grinnin'
I'm grinning with my teeth out
Just smiling
Showing my teeth now
Straight wildin', stay pullin' freaks now
Private island
That' were I sleep now
Private island
That' were I sleep now
Tom Hardy's just grinnin'
Grinnin' with his teeth out
Tom Hardy's just grinnin'
Grinnin' with his teeth out
Just grinnin', yeah

[Verse Two]:
My friends, I'm finna launch like blast off
They said I rap like Outkast, fact or false?
I take it like a diss and a compliment
Spit a verse and they started shaking like Parkinson
Got Pocahontas takin' off her moccasins
John Smith got change, y'all pocket lint
Isn't it funny how
They tell me I got a funny style
That's the sneak diss, cut it out
19 but hungry like I'm running out
Of time, tryin' to nickel and dime
But I'm sick outta my mind
Tom Hardy
If you don't like the way that I'm rocking
You can pardon it
Restartin' it, I'm working towards
Making money with 9th Wonder behind the boards
You are gonna see me sore
Cause when I shoot I score
And if it's locked up
I'm knocking down the door

[Chorus:]
They said I couldn't do it
I said I would, I did it
And now my biggest critics
Are saying I finna get it
They said I couldn't do it
I said I would, I did it
And now my biggest critics
Are saying I finna get it
I'm grinnin'
I'm grinning with my teeth out
Just smiling
Showing my teeth now
Straight wildin', stay pullin' freaks now
Private island
That' were I sleep now
Private island
That' were I sleep now
Tom Hardy's just grinnin'
Grinnin' with his teeth out
Tom Hardy's just grinnin'
Grinnin' with his teeth out

[Verse Three]:
And I like murdering mics like I might die at any minute
Quite nice when it's written
I spit it and now I'm grinnin'
People thought I'm the idiot in the village
Now I'm hittin' stages and they're sayin' that I killed it
I'm not fuckin' around, I'm not playin'
Rap money right around the corner and I'm racin'
Oh my god Tom I never had seen you
Rollin', rollin', rollin' gently down the street
Beat Gutter showed me the way
That's one third of Guess Who and Cortez back in the day
Yeah I stay, workin' with Brad like B.F.F.s
And we about to cash in a bunch of big ass checks
Flyin' in that jet that you saw on TV
Remember when they used to laugh at T3?
Look at me now?
Killin' the game, but no screw face
I'm grinnin' at lames like

[Chorus:]
They said I couldn't do it
I said I would, I did it
And now my biggest critics
Are saying I finna get it
They said I couldn't do it
I said I would, I did it
And now my biggest critics
Are saying I finna get it
I'm grinnin'
I'm grinning with my teeth out
Just smiling
Showing my teeth now
Straight wildin', stay pullin' freaks now
Private island
That' were I sleep now
Private island
That' were I sleep now
Tom Hardy's just grinnin'
Grinnin' with his teeth out
Tom Hardy's just grinnin'
Grinnin' with his teeth out
