[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Westside Gunn]
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes (grr), I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames (ayo)
No, oh, all these games

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, face tats and down, we was bagging weight
Fiend almost scratched his arm off, he couldn't wait
Rich niggas rocking Enfants Riches
Told my shooter to chill, God, he kept sniffing
Patek shine through Linda Farrow specs
Hanging out the F-Pace with the loaded TEC, God bless
Mark his loot for a maneuver
Only cooked it one time and we blew up, new goons
Prepare to clear the room soon
All these snakes around on my Gucci shoes
This that cocaine stuck to the pot, scrape
Coral statue in every corner, the Lord's grace
Off the top rope with the brick like Snuka, nigga
In the kitchen with my dance, I be cooking, nigga
Just Don, I need the pink 2s
Left his brains dragging 'cross the mink too
(Boom boom boom boom boom boom)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, new kitchen, same stoves, plain clothes, just tryna chase
Threw the 40, by God, the birds caulking up a 8
Couple flakes, too many chains on, I might suffocate
We cut his face his first day in, get out the fucking way
Fuck is this, ask for a bid, he gave his fucking shake
Now he laying in the dumpster without a fucking face
Porsche 961, we call those master, everlasting
Miss Machine Gun every day that'll fucking pass
Always rap about the fucking dope that you never had
Never showed your PSI, don't even fucking ask
Make sure my Fila Gosha
Might sell a thousand bricks for the culture
Unravel squares, rocking Unraveled
What you know about betting 200 mackerels
Gotta send 20 niggas to commissary
If you owe me a stamp, get your momma buried
(Boom boom boom boom boom boom)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
I didn't come for jokes, I didn't come for games
I didn't come to play with you lames
No, oh, all these games
