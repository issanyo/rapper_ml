INTRO
Yeah! See all the time people be asking me how I’m doing!
And I just tell ‘em “So Fine”
And recently I even lost a friend…..but I just pretend as if I’m all good!
REST IN PEACE GLENSITHO (02 May 1992 – 27 March 2013)

VERSE 1!
Howzit, heita daar, ekse, morning evening / Sanibonani, Thobela, Mzansi’s normal greetings / It’s what our contact begin with / casual or formal meeting / school or office premise / My response and feelings (So Fine) / These are problems of mine / I’ll just go I’m so fine / constant reply all the time / although it’s a lie / Responses alike / though you’d find I’m sobbing inside / Deep in my conscious you’ll find that I’m a corpse that’s dying / “How’re you doing today man?” / A tune from everywhere / Do you really care? / Who’s true sincerely then? / Prove for instance / Even your enemies ask / Hence a dude pretence / that he’s just doing very well / So fine I lead a lonely life / So Akon you not alone / the same goes with Toast / Brods I lost so many / those I thought of marrying / So although it’s hurting / I go on pretending!

HOOK
“Ola Ola” / Ekse mfana!
“Ekse fida?” / Aahh ke grende joe!
“Eyo wasup dawg?” / Yo wasup man?
“You good though” / (So Fine)
“Ekse boso” / Sure! Sure!
“Wa hlaba daar”/ Ya keya studio joe!
“O grende mara” / Aah ke wete joe!
“Hey, Thomas how’re you doing today?” (So Fine)

VERSE 2!
It’s all well with my soul, heart as well as my brain / But I felt I’m insane / conscious burning in flames / Sometimes I need me Rihanna’s umbrella in the rain / No matter the pain / Regardless the man will say (So Fine) / Me and dad’s relationship / is bad and passed that still / peeps be asking me / am I well within? / I kept pretending as if / I’m a relentless kid / Feel repetitive / as for weeks the answer is (So Fine) / Smoking and drinking beer / alone sinking in tears / console my feelings is weird / though it’s hidden in here / Drawing the picture to peers / it’s not even that clear /  Ignoring them living with fear / my soul’s ending is near / Pretentious; concerned with my wellbeing not healthy / Chances I pass and reach seventy is anorexic / Since adolescence I dreamed of being mad wealthy / Still anxious / Question is “Will I live that?” since I’m cashless!

VERSE 3!
I’m so fine I’m always wearing a smile dude / like conservative whites do / when pretending they like you / Struggle with school content / hustle moola to solve debt / regardless the mood’s bad / response is just “Good thanks”/ Don’t wanna bother people / with the problems I’m into / Since we all have issues / need a counsellor to speak to / Well I got pen and a pad, rap songs to speak through / Since I was a teenager / I needed ink and paper / It’s all good though I’m in pain sobbing with sorrow / Stop asking me, you’ll get the same response tomorrow / Life as an atheist (Thomas found God now) / with diet to learn and think / Fight endlessly with moms, cool I pretend we is / Don’t align with her beliefs / can't baptize at ZCC / “Go tla loka”, said so generations before us / Ask me how I does you’ll get the same pretentious Thomas!
