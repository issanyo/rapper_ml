[Bobby Seale at Free Huey Rally]
"'We gonna draw up a basic platform...just basic
That black people can read.'
He says, 'We don't want to go real elaborate
With all these essays, and disserations, and all this stuff
Because a brother gonna look at that
And he gonna say, "Man, I ain't got time for that
I got to go see what I can do for myself."'
He says, 'Just a basic platform that the mothers
Who struggle hard to raise us, that the fathers, who worked hard
That the young brothers in school, who come out of school semi-illiterate
And to teach black people, and our young black brothers and sisters
Their place in society because if they don't know their place in society
And in the world, they can't relate to anything else.'"

[Verse 1: GQ]
Please, forgive me if I'm not stressing
Over shit that don't matter
Compliments don't get me flattered
What's status to nigga living average?
In a basement just waiting for the attic, Still I'm at it
Yeah I'm in my lane more than Wilt practice
On point, they watered down just like a killed cactus
I fell backwards in a bad storm
Fuck the weather
Nights kept me up, set me up for something better
Got a stomach full of butterflies, I wonder why?
Remember sitting in winter wishing for summer skies?
Turned cheeks, words deep, probably cut a guy
Sharing my world with these feelings that I publicize
Pop look at me I persevered
My momma look at me and burst in tears
She only happy when her son happy
And sadly I've been hurt for years
But as of lately i've been working here
And for the record I keep driving until I wreck it
Life holding me controllably until I exit
My potna tripping, say his life, got him feeling worthless
I know he's wrong, cause see in life we all got a purpose
Fresh out of school trying to get my head right
This all happened around the same time I met 9th
At a point that had me feeling I was stuck inside
Years later I'm in BrightLady touching lives
When Granny died I swear it hurt seeing my cousin cry
Tell em I'm just an Oakland nigga with some southern pride
Overcoming aggravation, Tick
I'm still pissed at myself for missing your graduation
Huh, I guess it be intuition my mind told me
Rock and rolling and I'm Bon Jovi, They're eyes on me
With a sixth sense my neck twists
All dogs go to heaven try telling my Ex this, shit
Funny how it all click, perfect
I tread water till it all hit the surface
Loving everything that I decide to
Looking in the sky till my eyes blue
It's more than just a beat that I can rhyme to
Heaven had a window I just climbed through
Thank You
