[Verse 1]
Dark berry with the cold frame
Flying high in a soul plane
Looking just like my queen to be
You're on my mind when I wake up
Swear I got some time you could take up
I'd cross my heart but you have the key

[Refrain]
Oh I can't lie
This is something I can't fight
Tried running but I always come back for more
Girl you got a good heart
So successful and you work hard
I know you're special 'cause a good thing's hard to ignore

[Chorus]
I've been from here to Peru
Toronto to Timbuktu
And there's nothing greater
Nothing greater
I could cover every star in the sky
Travel light-years from this lifetime
But there's nothing greater
Nothing greater
There's nothing greater
Nothing greater

[Verse 2]
We're far from ordinary but we have an understanding
Any other love wouldn't be worth all the planet
But to me you're worth too much to lose
See I know that you be patient but I'll never keep you waiting
I made a decision and it isn't for debating
You're my choice if I ever have to choose

[Refrain]
Oh I can't lie
This is something I can't fight
Tried running but I always come back for more
Girl you got a good heart
So successful and you work hard
Know you're special 'cause a good thing's hard to ignore

[Chorus]
I've been from here to Peru
Toronto to Timbuktu
And there's nothing greater
Nothing greater
I could cover every star in the sky
Travel light-years from this lifetime
But there's nothing greater
Nothing greater
