[Hook] [Vandalyzm]:
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
Niggas thinkin' they 'bout to snooze on 'em then lose on 'em
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
Niggas thinkin' they 'bout to snooze on 'em then lose on 'em

[Verse Two] [Marv Won]:
I-I I'm in the game somethin' heavy
Better Business Bureau, there's nothin' you can sell me
Projectile, Ghost your face Mighty Healthy
Arrogance has an odor my nigga, do you smell me?
Yeah, get a whiff, I'm successful
Knee high rubber boots cause the game is a cesspool
And I refuse to fuck up my good denim
Just cause he from the hood don't mean he got hood in him
I mean, I got some game I could lend him
I scare labels like the old school Suge with venom
Giant on the microphone, fee, fi, foe 'em
Nose so high in the air, I can't see where I'm goin'
People tell me I don't look how I act
They hear me and they say I don't look how I rap
Girls love me
They say I don't look how I mack
Don't let this gut fool you, I don't look how I scrap
A wolf
I move on 'em if there's jewels on 'em
Yeah my niggas go dumb, we'll act a fool on 'em
I pull tool's on 'em
Two guns
Have him leakin' his exhaust the second I throw these dudes on him
It ain't nothin' but a Detroit mentality
A hip hop nigga with a D-boy salary
If you fuckin' lames keep takin' jabs at me
You gon' get your Family Tied like Alex and Mallory

[Hook] [Vandalyzm]:
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
Niggas thinkin' they 'bout to snooze on 'em then lose on 'em
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
I-I-I move on 'em like the tool's on 'em
Niggas thinkin' they 'bout to snooze on 'em then lose on 'em
