[Intro]
What about now?
Ohhhh

[Hook: Adriiian]
I got more paper in my notebook than my bank account
But why these niggas hating if they know they earn the same amount?
They depend on their girlfriends to make the payments bout
A couple days after they hit magic city to make it bounce
The bad news is you can't travel on my paper route
I'm flying on a nimbus, I got all you bitches chasing clouds
The good news is I can get rid of these haters now
I see snakes in the grass so I'm about to go and rake them out

[Verse 1: Adriiian]
Unapologetically blacker than a silhouette
A young innocent kid but bet my killers leave you stiff and wet
Me and weed go hand in hand like Hollywood and cigarettes
Or ketamine and discotheque, or Donald trump and disrespect
Nick, Negasi & Oxley, now that's a triple threat
Throw Ari in the mix and that's a squad full of wild cards
I live for the pressure, I'm the epitome of adventure
So don't you dare fucking ask me bout no mild bars
To all my suspect niggas don't go outside
I got a couple shrooms, I'm finna trip tonight
See, I'm Amiri Barack Obama, Salvador Dali Lama
Rolling up with Squad Almighty, feeding niggas molly water
The only reason these niggas keep trying to approach me's
Cuz they can't keep their eyes off my mophie and my roshes
I'm a walking lick, talking shit, balling like I'm Kobe
And in this life and the next, I just wanna be cozy

[Verse 2: Hajiic]
I flip the flame and furnace [?] like Donald Trump
These subtle snakes and simple men, I chop them up like venison
Bout that locker room talk, don't walk the walk
New edition politicians making visions
And they flipping, Tony Hawk
Lavish lives
[?]
We living in a hive
Just hannibals and cannibals in red and blue
Dirty foxes in they suits, get on news and lie to you
[?] and demo-rats
Hand it to the demographics
So fix your graphics
The resolution needed for this revolution isn't magic
That media mind traffic
Leaving your mind tragic
Forgetting your lines
I'm taking your time
You're losing your mind
[?]
There's nothing divine
Political grime
About to break so take a break
Cut out the fakes you're sure to find
[?]
Lost in the lies of the gemini
That sly crew of red and blue
It's the same coin just two sides
It's a white moon and a black sky
And it's crushing us with its huge tides
It'll get yours then get mine
Don't relax, just rewind
I see storms, I see signs like I'm taking notes from Eli
Testify, it's my advice, cuz
No chocolate chips in the American cookie
I said it's no chocolate chips in the American cookie
I heard life's a bitch, better grab her by the pussy
King
