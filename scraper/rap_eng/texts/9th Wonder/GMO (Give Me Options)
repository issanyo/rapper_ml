(Chorus)
All my enemies...I try and keep 'em close
Is you a friend to me? Cuz I don't even know...
OMG, I don't want your GMO
OMG, I don't want your GMO
Please don't envy me
Cuz I don't need your jealousy
Put a label on your sleeve so the people know...
OMG, I don't want your GMO...

(Verse 1)
...You ain't even know me,  yet you try to slap
Nutritional facts on my back
2% trans-fat - he a skinny cat
Must be on the smack
Nah, I'm on the ball
Heart attack, wack cholesterol
High sodium, opium overdosin', tip the salt
Keep the gluten toast, in my suit and coat
For them stupid folk
Cuttin' super-dope with that artificial sucralose
Fake sugar-coatin'
Loc'in you okey-dokin' local yokels
I'm high-fructose potion-indulgin'
Yo, ends-splurgin', measuring by the serving
Dishin' the sermon like Erick with 80-karat urges
Only thing I can think is I make em nervous
'Criminal' at the top of they associative word list
I'm giving food-for-thought, with no additives
Actually eco-friendly
My enemy's combativeness
DNA: Dumb Name Acronym
Don't Need Accumens/Accolades/ or Acid hits

(Chorus)
All my enemies...I try and keep 'em close
Is you a friend to me? Cuz I don't even know...
OMG, I don't want your GMO
OMG, I don't want your GMO
Please don't envy me
Cuz I don't need your jealousy
Put a label on your sleeve so the people know...
OMG, I don't want your GMO...

(Verse 2)
...Deep-fried, genetically modified, contrived
People collide often with good health
Your personality done expired up on the shelf
You treat people the way you feelin' about yourself
The hate you preachin' is what be killing us
Not the films or video games of this age	
And not the music we play;
You lames can't understand it, and never will...
Instead of feeding us food, feeding us pills
Y'all muthafuckas need to CHILL...
And give thanks
Pray for the seed banks
Say 'hello' to eating green and 'so long' to the beef franks
Let me just be frank
Hip-hop is all-fresh, raw flesh
Meanwhile, y'all frauds is processed...
Count your blessings before your calories
These muthafuckas is crazy; claimin' allergies
DNA: Dark New Analogy
Decimatin' these New Ass-clownery - clad fallacies

(Chorus)
All my enemies...I try and keep 'em close
Is you a friend to me? Cuz I don't even know...
OMG, I don't want your GMO
OMG, I don't want your GMO
Please don't envy me
Cuz I don't need your jealousy
Put a label on your sleeve so the people know...
OMG, I don't want your GMO...
OMG, I don't want it  -
No...

(Bridge)
Don't...let..your brain, get...washed
Ditch..that..fear, that's what they...want
To make you dee, pend, ent - up-on
Them, - (its all about the CREAM, dolla dolla bill, yall)

(Outro)
One seed for all
One seed to feed them
One seed to rule them all
To make us need them
Be your own farmer
Learn how to breed them...
Science put 'em in prison
But should have freed them

OMG, I don't want your GMO
Yo, BRB, no way, GTFO
Fuck an LOL, might as well LMAO
BTW, STFU - G2G, xo
- Sincerely, JTO
