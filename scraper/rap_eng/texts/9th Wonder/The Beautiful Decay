[Verse 1: Psyonik]
Look at my city
Ruggedly beautiful and pretty
And at times she’s intelligent and witty
It’s a pity
Cuz she gotta a darker side
She got me gassed up and I don’t wanna spark the fire
So I keep the flame ‘wet’ like a Sillhou-
And inside a nigga weep like Willow
She’s a thriller on the whole
But a killer to the soul
Matter fact
I think she gotta weapon in her sole!
When she step a nigga know
I could see the blade runnin’
Whisper to her spirit just so I could save somethin
Lookin’ like a angel but she committin’ hella sins
Fatal with them tendencies perfect with that elegance
Look into her eyes all I see is despair
But I still see the evidence, something’s there
She just needs to overcome it
Climb to the summit
When she make it to the top
She’ll be proud that she done it
Like a hundred - hanging by three digits
Whip it like it’s lic’rice her kisses is delicious
So I can’t ever sever this city, she's the mistress
I’m tryna mend her soul where is Heaven’s seamstresses
Before you ever look or just find something to say
She’ll hit you with that beautiful decay

[Verse 2: Isaiah G]
Look at my city, she engaged with my blues
She got involved with a bunch of unsavory crews
I see her daily on news, and I'm staying confused
I hope she win the game of life but then she play and she lose
And then she putting drugs in her body constantly
Is it because her education was a mockery
She won the lottery, and blew it all in a week
And she resumes violence in the summer following peace
I guess she follow the piece, cuz she the queen yall dyin
She bought elections for Blagojevich and George Ryan
Lying to the neighborhood, cuz you know her paper good
Running over bulls since '91 like a Laker would
She think she Magic, really a crack addict
And marijuana circulating, got the children percolating
Exposed herself, imposed her wealth
Walking around with big diamonds like she posed for stealth
She bout to close her health, if its any left anyway
I’m praying for redemption I will take a step anyday
In the midst of it, she exuberant
Maneuvering around the lessons of crack and weed that she tutoring
She lost her majesty, her initial sweetness gave me cavities
This is really a tragedy
But this is just another day in the week
I ate her soul and got the beautiful decay in my teeth
