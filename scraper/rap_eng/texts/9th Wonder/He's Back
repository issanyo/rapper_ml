[Intro]
New shit. What are we gonna do? Uh huh

[Verse One]
Jeah
Me and my Little Brother is back
Hold me down with the pound when I'm in North Cac'
See my stacks is for stripes
So they call me the general
I've been around, bend 'em down so send 'em down
Straight from a legend now
Or straight like six o'clock but still rep seven now
I came around just to drop some facts
So it's a wrap for all of that now that he's back

[Hook]
"What are we gonna do, now that he's back?"

[Verse Two]
Now that's he's back
The feedback is we need that
Giving more jewels to the seeds that
Can't get what I got cause I got what they need
And they need what I got cause over here they spray weed
Say cheese for the big picture
You in the frame but they can't fit ya
Let me change the fixture
Put the light more bright in ya eyesight
I shine, you shine, I gave you the limelight
You still wouldn't know what to do
See a plot with no plan makes sense like bowling with glue
Let me show you how to mold it into
I [?] 9th Wonder of the Earth for the world to view

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Now that's he's back
Ease back
Chill with the poor and throw the cheese back
Nobody was calling
[?] me back so my bomb is the new phenomenon, see that?
Don't believe that
Belief is blind faith
Let's see what this nine say
You see what the sign say
The sign say, "Stop and yield"
And this for all y'all niggas who think you can stop my steel
He's back

[Bridge] {x2}
You can look up in the sky and see
(Who's that?)
It's the B.D.I. MC
(And who?)
9th Wonder and the Justus League
With Little Brother and Boot Camp, this is Chemistry
