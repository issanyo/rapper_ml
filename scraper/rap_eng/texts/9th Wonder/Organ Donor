[Verse 1]
I take my time, the most waited on
The greatest lines, the greatest songs
Feel like I got to drop those
Court martialed, for fucking G.I. Jane in her fox hole
Escorted by M.P.'s, I do more than MC
Anti Politician, and I got a vision
Detail with freedom
It's over when stealth gets free son
Fuck it! to the moon Jackie Gleason
The public asks me reasons, why the coldness?
Maybe I'm just like my Father, too bold shit
Got castaway 'cause I thought and rap this way
What's real? due to the raw image
But still, I put my all in it

[HOOK]
I'm the lonely loner, should I start this shit?
The organ donor, I put my heart in this
It's stretched out, put it all on the table
With my chest out, truth hits, not a fable
The lonely loner, should I start this shit?
The organ donor, I put my heart in this
It's stretched out, put it all on the table
With my chest out, truth hits not a fable

[Verse 2]
I'm entertained, by Will Smith as an actor
Man, I hate Will Smith as a rapper
Just not my cup of tea
A you fuck, till the cops get fucked with me
Want to slam me on the hood
Like that kid in Englewood
Lately treacherous, maybe death is bliss
But you know what?
Almost had my throat cut by the cut-throats
I don't ride love boats, I jet ski with envy
LEGACY the enemy, it's Public slash one
Mr Fuck-it has come
Wrapped up in the flesh
And that's what's in his chest

[HOOK]
I'm the lonely loner, should I start this shit?
The organ donor, I put my heart in this
It's stretched out, put it all on the table
With my chest out, truth hits not a fable
The lonely loner, should I start this shit?
The organ donor, I put my heart in this
It's stretched out, put it all on the table
With my chest out, truth hits not a fable

[Verse 3]
All of this comes from the left, side of my chest
Got sick, and went to the vet
Got well, equivalent to a molotov cocktail
Hot flaming bottles, got brains boggled
It's hard to get, and it's hard to spit
This consistent
But this one's different
Made crews change their name, then ask them
"why the music ain't the same since I been rapping?"
Everything else sounds mediocre
In Carolina we cobras that strike quick
I only write hits, Paul McCartney
For the kids, large as Barney, Purple Rain
Twice the dope if a verse is changed
My crew deep like Ben Bay
I got the style of a sensei
Got to see them before you can get to me
Even then, you still can't get to me
As the world so so shit
Girls hop on my pogo stick
I no longer call them chicks
This is a new way out
Now I call them fish when I put bait in their mouth
Hook line and sinker
Sorry you don't understand I'm a thinker

[HOOK]
I'm the lonely loner, should I start this shit?
The organ donor, I put my heart in this
It's stretched out, put it all on the table
With my chest out, truth hits not a fable
The lonely loner, should I start this shit?
The organ donor, I put my heart in this
It's stretched out, put it all on the table
With my chest out, truth hits not a fable
