[Verse 1: Solange]
Twice I turned my back on you
Now I fall flat on my face [?]

Tell me where would I go, tell me what led you on
I'd like to know

[Chorus]
Was it the blue light (blue light), in my direction
Was it the movement (movement)
I wonder if we're going under
Oh, was it the light waves (light waves), so brightening (brightening)
Was it the movement (movement)
One miracle and I stay now

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Was it the blue light (blue light), in my direction
Was it the movement (movement)
I wonder if we're going under
Was it the light waves (light waves), so brightening (brightening)
Was it the movement (movement)
One miracle and I stay now

[Piano solo]
