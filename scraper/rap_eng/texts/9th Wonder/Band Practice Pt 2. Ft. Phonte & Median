They ask me what I think about the competition
And I say "No, I couldn't care less about the team strugglin'
I wanna kiss you" New Tigallo, New Tigallo, New Tigallo
Tigallo and 9th Wonder, maybe
We got yo girl undulating
To the rhythm of the drum
Wet t-shirt lookin' like a vacation
Take it off like Monday, baby
And there will be no underrating
So please hold your applause
Let it bump a little up in your cars
They say that boy's back
Nigga, this is blackboard rap
You can gon' chalk it up to a loss
And if you got a problem with it, walk it up to the boss
And get your card pulled like pitty pat
Body a verse and put it in a pine box
You niggas can get a fuckin' shine box, Billy Batts
And really that's all my time, this is the last chapter
You x and y, we off the damn axis
Intricate, me and 9th, two of God's instruments
And when we get together you can call it band practice
Men of action, they hustle bass ackwards
Penny for your thoughts kid, miss me with that rappin'
Sho Nuff, I am like the master
See the glow what, grown up, I am that then
I am passion, two parts magic
Sprinkle in authentic, simmer with a little madness
Got a vendetta for the magistrate
Catch you in the world plain clothes, ain't no tellin' what'll happen
That would be entrapment
Please, the audacity and casualty of crassness
I am absent minded for I am past it
Fry a fish much bigger for the inquisitive Jurassic
Picture Moby Dick, hold a flick, don't miss it
May sank your ship, Ahab iddish
You need Arab benjamins when payin' close attention to the mentionings
I too have brought an instrument for I've always known that they were listenin' this is the last chapter
You x and y, we off the damn axis
Intricate, me and 9th, two of God's instruments
And when we get together you can call it band practiceAnd really that's all my time, this is the last chapter
You x and y, we off the damn axis
Intricate, me and 9th, two of God's instruments
And when we get together you can call it band practice
