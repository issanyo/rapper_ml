[Verse 1:]
It's the prism district
No time to get this twisted
How long have we existed
The pain that we resisted
Survive with mad persistence
I can't exact the distance
Of what we've traveled so far, makin a move with no car
Had a talk with Jupiter so we could get to know Mars
I'm talkin the kids with no moms, how they get stuck with that life?
See we be ninjas at night, but we special with light
We took the lasers and separated the phases
Until we flipped the script, then we called it polarization
- Hold up so you could take in, the sound that we be makin'
We had some tragic tremors, they left my city shakin'
Trials and tribulations, tempests and hurricanes
Happiness and elation, I think the coin's the same
I think it's all connected, the clarity, the dust
For us to suffer the pain apparently we must
No-one in life to play the "US" part
Making blood diamonds with crushed hearts
We’re making it thus far... We making it thus far
Yo

[Verse 2:]
This district of prisms with the cracks all in it
Rough around the edges like a hacksaw finish
You either build or destroy where you live at?
Don’t matter what you take - it matter what you give back
And my city’s been takin blows like a wrestler
And we’ve been giving back loads but no one mentions us
Attention Deficit, my city learned the lesson quick
Paid attention to ourselves that’s where we’re investing it
Relentless, endless, this prism is stupendous
Diamond with the rhyming so human hand could rend this
A sentence is what they send us when success is in sight
No visitation for my sentence and my sentence is life
Dedicated to medicating human souls
And without my district, my purpose would be unknown
See my spirit is sewn into this prism, shawshaking these prisons
My goal is not sit on the throne of lyricism
Capture one ray of light, and I make it many
You ain’t have to leave your name I ain’t takin any
But if you ever feel your spirit is being resisted
Or that you’ll go ballistic
