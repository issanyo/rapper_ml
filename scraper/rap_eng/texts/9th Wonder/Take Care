[Intro: GQ & Sample]
Back on it(Take care of you)
I'm tryna(I will)
(Even if I take care of you, I will)Back on it

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna(take care of you)
That is if you let me
I want to love you but you neglect me that's why its hard to(take care of you)
I mean I want to
You live around the same people that haunt you how I'm supposed to(take care of you)
The streets stealing children
Set fire then steal our buildings they ain't tryna(take care of you)
Look how the music moving
My mama say what's Gods you never lose and I just hope he(take care of you)
And I hope that too
Love, some people I owe that to, might just help (take care of you)
This rap shit gon' make us paper 
Don't understand but years later I know it's gon' (take care of you)
New mother acting crazy
Keeping my patna' from his baby, but he the one that (take care of you)
This thing we call life is wild
I just hope my family proud, I told Asia imma (take care of you)
Watch when the shit start crackin
They said it wouldn't but when it happens my actions gon' (take care of you)
Me? I don't be toting chrome
But know some people back at home, get out of line I bet they (take care of you)
I give a mother fuck about Trump
Government acting like some punks I know I'm blunt but let me (take care of you)
With a sincere fuck you
Hey Oakland you know I love you that's why I had to...

[Chorus]
(Take care of you, I will)
That's why I had to(take care of you, I will)

[Verse 2]
I told Jas (take care of you)
I feel I owe that to your brother
My best friend always got her covered only right I(take care of you)
For the folk that was treating me badly
I know you hate to see me happy when I smile that's gon'(take care of you)
They threw stones when I had no armor
Wanted revenge on you Imma just let karma(take care of you)
My flow stupid, ain't it?
Gallery on me for all I painted ,like look we gon'(take care of you)
Was hanging banners now I just hang in cabanas
Using my shirt for pajamas tonight she say that Imma (take care of you)
Hit harder than rivals beefing
They call on me like Michael Keaton but still I won't(take care of you)
To some folk I really hope this piss you off
To get to heaven how much Lyft gon cost? Driver imma(take care of you)
Beat got me trippin
Another sample that 9th was flipping I'm flippin on this(take care of you)
I've been living on the road
Everything I touch is gold tell Egyptians I can(take care of you)
I wonder how far we go
I mean I'm humble but not sorry though, let that feeling(take care of you)
For the ones that's close and always kept it real
Whatever's left in my will I just hope it will(take care of you)
If you ain't doing shit in life I'll probably bug you
Hey Oakland, you know I love you that's why I had to...

[Chorus]
(Take care of you, I will)
That's why I had to(take care of you, I will)
