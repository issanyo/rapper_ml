[Verse 1: Beyonc√©]
Take a minute girl, come sit down
And tell us what's been happening
In your face I can see the pain
Don't you try to convince us that you're happy, yeah
We've seen this all before
Brothers taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone
You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm telling you

[Hook]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
We want you to know that we love you

[Verse 2: Kelly]
See, what y'all don't know about him
Is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job
And I ain't making it easy
I know you see him bugging most of the time
But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes but I need my man
I don't think y'all understand, I'm telling ya

[Hook]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
We want you to know that we love you
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
We want you to know that we love you

[Bridge: Michelle]
Girl, take a good look at yourself
He got you going through hell
We ain't never seen ya down like this
What you mean you don't need us to help?
We know each other too well
Girl, you're my girl, we your girls
We want you to know that we love you

[Hook]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
We want you to know that we love you
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
We want you to know that we love you
