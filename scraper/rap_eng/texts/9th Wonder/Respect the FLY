I usually roll through with bitches and Soju
Spliffs and cold  brew I’ll diss ya whole crew
Reduced to ashes ya caskets lay
In close quarters combat I'm Cassius Clay
Ash this jay and transverse through a white light
I write like: Alfred Hitchcock hard baguette on the wrist watch
You glad I wrote this
Craft an opus with a mass of focus

Smellin’ like Armani Code: bitches open the club doors as I enter bold
Breakin’ marijuana on a centerfold  then ya sister rolled
We light blue haze and get higher than ya wifes bouquets
Im the talent
I let the suites pay
The coupes gray fuck what you say, I wear Heat like the cover of 2K

I sport raw selvage with the Timberland boots enterin’ coupes like the stig
Can't shoot like the kid(waco)
Yall see me in missions with tall Maldivian vixens like Black Dynamite
In the hood where niggas sell crack and china white

Ya wife hold me tight  I'm Dolemite get ya ho to hold the mic
During my show tonight
Paid Anderson Silva
10 stacks just  to throw the fight
