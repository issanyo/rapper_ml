Hey yo wait back it up, up easy back it up
Wait back it up up easy back it up up
Hey yo wait back it it easy back it up up
Wait back it up up easy back it up up
She look good she look good
I ain’t ever had an ass like that
That’s all good she look good
She look good I swear I would
Leave right now if I could
She look good she look good
If she text I’m a hit right back like I should
She look good she look good
I say I’m about to leave she say
I wish you would

[Verse 1]
Skin so beautiful cup size beautiful
Perfect everywhere from her hair to her
Cuticles she the one I do it for
See how your eyes glow to supersede
Sex she completes my survival
When I know her beauty on rival
Till it's hard not to fall in love with
Wherever I go psycho I am tell you
She’s crazy her beauty and her flaws
I love it all having my baby and
Maybe and I mean just maybe
I surrender my soul should be sweet
Enough to save me from myself that is
Man I love her so much got to
Left my kids for three weeks in a row
I left them at my mama's house now
We ain’t no more so what
I’m happy as fuck even though most of
The homies saying I should back it up

[Hook]
Hey yo wait back it up, up easy back it up
Wait back it up up easy back it up up
Hey yo wait back it it easy back it up up
Wait back it up up easy back it up up
She look good she look good
I ain’t ever had an ass like that
That’s all good she look good
She look good I swear I would
Leave right now if I could
She look good she look good

[Verse 2]
She worked the angles on an
Instaflix got me smiling every time
That I seen that she sent a flick
And she appreciate the simple shit
Like when I hold the door and
Her mind full up of interest
Hit the flix a little bit of thai food
With extra mac sauce when we slide
Through the drive through
Su las cos pe cenias a little thing
You do to make a woman remember
That’s special especially if you all up
In the ave and messing with the crew
I watched games with her ate chicken
Wings with her now every night
I was paying for the dinner and like I
Am about to die everytime I ain't with her
My best friend hit me saying I ain’t
The same nigga so what I’m happy
As fuck even though all the homies
Saying I should back it up

[Hook]
Hey yo wait back it up, up easy back it up
Wait back it up up easy back it up up
Hey yo wait back it it easy back it up up
Wait back it up up easy back it up up
She look good she look good
I ain’t ever had an ass like that
That’s all good she look good
She look good I swear I would
Leave right now if I could
She look good she look good
If she text I’m a hit right back like I should
