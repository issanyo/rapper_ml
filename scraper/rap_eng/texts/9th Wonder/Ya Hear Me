[Intro : Jozeemo]
I’ve been living so foul so long, I swear
I think it’s the only way I know how to live
The streets made a monster in Jozeemo
I might need some help
Let’s go

[Hook]
The streets is all I know, the drugs is what I do
The crime is a damn shame, God, you hear me?
The streets is all I know, the drugs is what I do
The crime is a damn shame

[Verse 1]
You want to talk about hammers? Well I own some
You want to talk about cases? Well I got a few
Probably ‘cause I shot at you
I’m from the east side of Durham where the cops patrol
And live by the code “lock and load”
Glocks explode and grandmothers end up crying
Half the time, the wrong nigga always end up dying
What’s a daddy? Ain’t nobody got them, we got to suffer
Knowing some dirty nigga in the back fucking our mother
School shopping, got two outfits, the other kids noticed
Started joking, shit, I ain’t been back since
I was a little nigga fiending to eat
And when the weather got cold, I found out the true meaning of heat
Fuck a radiator kerosene
I was 11 years old with a nine, I was strapped with a inf beam
Way too young for this grown man shit
But I’ll be damned if I’m on clutching with a two-hand grip
Come on

[Hook 4x]
The streets is all I know, the drugs is what I do
The crime is a damn shame, God, you hear me?

[Verse 2]
Yo
I heard of CREAM but the DREAM seem astounding
‘Cause in my hood, drugs rule everything around me
Never hit the mall, the booth will bring the stores to you
It’s amazing what some hard can do
Make a mother take the food right out of a child’s mouth
A preacher get to losing religion and wild out
I’ve seen it all first hand
All-nighters on the block scared as fuck trying to bubble off my first gram
I got robbed, I got punched in the eye
And said “fuck it”, next nigga try to play me got to die
So before I got posted up, 40-cal holsted up
Been about my life, took the strip and lit the whole shit up
That’s when the beef came, the hood had my back, jack
So that’s when the east came and Jozee got the street fame
The LOV was running shit, we had it locked, stocked, and barreled
Thorough, that’s even before the summer hit

[Hook]
