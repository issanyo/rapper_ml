[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for tuning into Median's Relief. (Alright, Ok) Welcome! (Uh-huh)
And some of you might be thinking, "What is Median's Relief?"
It's attraction baby, I mean, it is relief, just vibe with it

[Hook] (x2)
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, get it
Don't stop, don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, get it, get it, get it
Don't stop (don't stop), get it, get it

[Verse 1]
Don't stop, get it, get it, kinda like that new iddish
Just a lil different, when I flip it then I twist and spin it
You can feel it in your chest
You'll be [?], feel it in her breast
