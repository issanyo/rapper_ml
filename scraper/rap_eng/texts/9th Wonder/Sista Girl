[Verse 1: L.E.G.A.C.Y.]
I'm asking, "You got a man?"
"Never mind, I don't want to know"
"Leg's the one, in due time you're gonna know"
"What's on the itinerary, that dude you're with"
"He's only temporary!"
About as high as sky, look the eye to eye
The soul vision, that said your mouth
Move me up in the pole position
"You don't know what I'd do to you"
"You're so beautiful"
"Oh sister girl, this is your world"
She smiled, that got me hurt
Fragrant smelling like Bath and Body works
So sweet, "I'm hungry let's go eat"
Talk about what we're doing later on
"I'm loved and hated on, you might of heard?"
"These aren't just words"
"Might catch me in the suburbs"
"Or in the hood mami, plus"
"I think you'll look good on me"
My game chose, "let's make a deal"
"Tired of these lame hoes, are you play or real?"
"Act fast, let me know"
"Matter of fact, let's go"
"Matter of fact, let's go"

[HOOK: Keisha Shontelle]
You say you want to give your loving to me?
The feeling is, so mutual
Sister girl gonna give it to you
As long as you do, everything you want to do
You want to give your loving to me?
The feeling is, so mutual
Sister girl

[Verse 2: L.E.G.A.C.Y. (sample vocal]
We got in the whip and burned out
Off the strip, you turned out
She passed me the L
If only you knew, pumping Patti LaBelle
Just me and... (sister girl)
And you gon' love me sister girl
"I want you so bad! Like ABC Aisha"
"Crazy me, I'll be a, fool for you"
"Cop jewels for you, nah! I'm lying"
"It ain't about that" I'm replying
"We can do without that, get on bigger things"
"Beyond material things"
"Please work with Leg", she thoroughbred
Her trot was hot, sister girl why I made this tune
In the parking lot, see we never made it to the room
Love's the worst right? With no sight
Love at first 'pike

[HOOK: Keisha Shontelle]
You say you want to give your loving to me?
The feeling is, so mutual
Sister girl gonna give it to you
As long as you do, everything you want to do
You want to give your loving to me?
The feeling is, so mutual
Sister girl
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
