So I cocked back and squeezed
Let the beat bleed
You'd think I sneezed; 'god bless me'
Murder with my speak
Praise the lord & pass the ammo
Yeah I'm aiming for my dreams
On these beats like I'm rambo
Commando with a fleet
Going ham, though these rappers giving sneak flows
It'sï»¿ weak flows
I'mma manhandle you like a priest in the sheets though
Little boy, you better think this food for thought's real beef
