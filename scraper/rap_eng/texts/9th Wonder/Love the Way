Ohh baby I love the way
I love the way that you're walking (walking)
That sexy way that you're talking (talking)
Got everything that I'm missing (I'm missing)
Girl I love the way
Ohh baby I love the way, baby
The way you say my name (my name)
You make a man insane (insane)
Ain't here to play no games, I love the way
Ohh baby I love the way

The way we sleep together, we spoon so perfect
Make that girl I met last June seem worthless
The way your fingers fit right into my hand
Perfect height and age, perfect shade of tan
Sitting in the sand, watching sunset, simple
Dinner and a movie, quality tiempo
Laid back tempo, nothing too fast
Slow and easy making this relationship last
Laying in the bed, I'm warm and I'm cosy
Slide next to me, put your cold feet on me
The best part about you, the worst part about you
That's how I know I love you and I can't live without you

Ohh baby I love the way
I love the way that you're walking (walking)
That sexy way that you're talking (talking)
Got everything that I'm missing (missing)
Girl I love the way
Ohh baby I love the way, baby

[Murs]
Turn off the Xbox, get my attention
Kiss me, strip down, get down to business
Still ain't old, so many years later
Didn't think it could, only got greater
Inside and outside, I know every part of you
Know where you going before you even start to move
Now that don't mean I don't love
Every minute I'm spending in your arms when we hug
They say we boring, all we do is watch TV
You like cooking for me, your girl say it's cheesy
Corny, traditional, all day I'm missing you
Vision of us sitting on the couch and I'm kissing you

Ohh baby I love the way

[Murs]
Kicked out the kitchen, I always leave a mess
You know my strawberry Kool-Aid is the best
Yes I always love you, hope it never change
The way you kind of smile when you start to say my name
I love the way that you do you
And I hope you love the way that I'm doing you too

Ohh baby I love the way {*X3*}
