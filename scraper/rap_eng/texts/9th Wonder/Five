(Hook)
You can't hit this shit, you can't hit it
You can’t hit this shit, you can’t hit this
Not unless you throw five on it
Not unless you throw five

(1st Verse)
3.5 grams is what I’m copping
Do you understand, my man? Let’s get it popping
Got no time for slacking on the pack up
Breaking down buds. Put it in bowl I pack up
Now I’m packed to the brim
Of this psychedelic marijuana medicine
Call it what you call it
If you ain’t no alcoholic
Then you know the truth is overdue
Im’a face this blunt and snooze
Two hours later I got my back up
‘Fore you know it, four hours later I say, “I’m back up.”
All this weed could do is make me is crack up
Ask my homie later, “Have you hit this Green Crack stuff?”
Got a nigga stuck like Chuck
Spent my last hundred on an eighter and a pair of Chucks
In weed we trust
Little did you know the dollar is made of green stuff
It’s the Canvas

(Hook)
You can't hit this shit, you can't hit it
You can’t hit this shit, you can’t hit this
Not unless you throw five on it
Not unless you throw five
(x2)

(2nd Verse)
Heat games, heat rays
Going to the beach days
Trying to hit a different bong for every set of weekdays
October, November, last month, and after
Hitting kush up out the mask. Shit done got me gassed up
Papes up, blunts up, vapes up
Gotta understand ma’, go get this cake up
Mary Jane could my babe, uh
Now let’s go get these fucking sugar cubes laced up nigga, uh!

(Hook)
You can't hit this shit, you can't hit it
You can’t hit this shit, you can’t hit this
Not unless you throw five on it
Not unless you throw five
