[Verse: Kid Wonderz]

Once upon a time
Their was this girl I met
And every time I saw her my hands would just sweat
Dont know what it reminded me of her in my eyes
She looked blue like the sky
And lonelier then a shinier star at night
So I went up to her to say hi
Then from the moment I knew she'd be mine
Nice as she can be with her im always feeling free
No matter what her love to me is a guarantee
We been through alot of struggles to keep it strong
Made alot of songs about her to keep it on
Never knew that we'd be together for this long
Til we made one of our own to call our own
You damaged me but I still love you
I just wanna apologize for the shit we been through
From the pain to the lies we exchanged
I wish it was like back then cause now it ain't the same
Ever since you left I lost memory of your name
So I told my self love is lost in a maze in my brain
Was it because of me and my ways?
Cause I was lost in directions to your love some days
You say I drive you crazy when I'm drunk
Drinking and driving is bad enough
When we were young I still gave you a fuck
Cruising through the past no stop sign for the future
Smoking blunts at the beach and enjoying our adventures
What could we for something for like this?
I rather have you right here feeling on my lips
Cruising through the past if you ever think about that?
Then fuck the past we don't need to go back
We already have a little girl in our life
All we need is you and me and everything will be alright
We don't need to go back then
Cause we already have a future set for us to begin babe
I just wanna tell ya that I really love you girl
I really do and I'm sorry
For hurting you all those times ya know?
Yeah
