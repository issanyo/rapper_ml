[Intro/Hook]
Do it, do it - open my thoughts
Open my thoughts to a new night
Open my thoughts to a new night, embrace my life
Grasp passion and actions and put it in flight, yeah
Heh, open my thoughts to a new night
Embrace my life, grasp passion and actions
And put it in flight - the stairways

[Verse 1]
Let me explain, I did it with flow back in the day
Ha, woulda said "no homo" but I'm a grown man
Heh, woulda fed mo' Totos but I'm a known dad
Best believe I'm still workin on that foreign land
And I'm just checkin in, likin what I'm seein
I might kick it for a minute with my informal mistress
The groove got 'em trickin, and treatin, feedin 'em
They eatin, it's delicious, hit 'em where the beat is
Thinkin 'bout Gee again, lately we've been speaking
Thought about a question and it needs to be the thesis
You think that it would lead me there, I can't even speak of it
Wishin by the mentioning of his name that he could be again
By simply speaking it, anyone you miss you do the same
And on the light of things, for those who only peep for entertainment
Let me abracadabra David Blaine a bit, 3000 ya, put you on the range
Right near the beach somewhere in Africa
T-Paining your log cabin in Asp-irin, {*inhales*} gasp a bit
Now let me back in, this is magic
The chemistry we're making, everytime I open up my thoughts

[Interlude]
Excuse me, was that the Dungeon Family School methods you just used against me?
I learned so many styles, forgive me, heh

[Verse 2]
Open my thoughts, open my thoughts to a new night
Open my thoughts to a new night
Embrace my life, grasp passion and actions
And put it in flight - the stairways
Start steppin to the track, makin airwaves
Immortalize divine designed for the airplay
I dare say air it out, let me be your audio coat, just wear it out
Posted no cares in the couch, whatever you're about
Headphones with the iPod, preparin for a bout
Just crusin, a play in the lot, not really movin
Parkin lot pimpin, mergin on your Michelins
Don't forget the blinkers, study long study wrong
Don't forget your thinkers, keep an open mind
Towards the night and what it brings to you, the many things that kings do
And queens too, swimmin in jeans due in the gene pool
Pursuin the dream, it use to be a visu
But no no, that's a no-no, I like to think that I'm
As genuine as Levi's, as far as hip-hop
I seen the same happen to bebop and doo-wop and Reebok
In my parable, that fast jazz had more comparisons
Pause grandad --

[Hook/Outro]
Open my thoughts
Open my thoughts to a new night
Open my thoughts to a new night, embrace my life
Grasp passion and actions and put it in flight, yeah
Heh, open my thoughts to a new night
Embrace my life, grasp passion and actions
And put it in flight - the stairways, hey
You're only funky as your last cut
Focus on the past, your ass'll be a has-what
Yeah, you're only funky as your last cut
Focus on the past, your ass'll be a has-what
Yeah, you're only funky as your last cut
Focus on the past, your ass'll be a has-what, yeah
