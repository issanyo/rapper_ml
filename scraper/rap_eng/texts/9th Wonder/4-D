(1st Verse)
What the world could make is my purpose
When the world could shake cause I’m nervous
The ball gets dropped like bird shit
Diversion, wordsmith
Cut the game off; I’m the tourniquet
Think you rappers need a learner’s permit
Phony rap contract jerked as shit
You ain't even got time to go work her lips
That’s why I made this
I’m ‘bout to put it down for the grave shift
Life got me on a slave shift
I’m just running like a playlist
That’s when I rewinded time
Cause I’m feeling like Im losing my mind
That’s when I rewinded time
I’m feeling like I'm losing what’s mine

(2nd Verse)
What the world could make is my purpose
When the world could shake cause I’m nervous
The ball gets dropped like bird shit
Diversion, wordsmith
Cut the game off; I’m the tourniquet
Light ‘em up, set it off, and burn this shit
Terrors of the urban
Niggas in a black Suburban curb-swerving
Drunk off liquor, high on herb ‘n’
Drink a 32 down Bourbon
I get raspy off Jack D
One more shot ‘fore I lean on gravity
Calamity!
I keep asking, “Why she’s not mad at me?
At least not yet…”
Man, I’m gonna rock it

(Hook)
You’re retracing my steps
While I’m chasing timeless
(x2)
That won’t work little baby
That won’t work baby
(x2)

You’re retracing my steps
While I’m chasing timeless
(x3)
That won’t work little baby
That won’t work baby

(Bridge)
And drift into 4-D
And drift into 4-D
And drift into 4-D
And drift into 4-D
(x2)

That won’t work little baby
That won’t work baby
