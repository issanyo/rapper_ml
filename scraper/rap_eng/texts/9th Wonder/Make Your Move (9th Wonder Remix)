I got a feeling a nigga could make a killing
If he packed up his bags and moved to New Zealand
New Guinea, New York, you need something new
Besides them fucking Newports prepared to be dead
The street said, "your shit's soft like wheat bread
On your own block you make shit they won't knock"
I'm a worldwide hustler, whores be at us
Cuz of O.G. status fans throw weed at us
And I spread love just the same
Let this Buddah bless ya brain, Sexy thang
Yeah, it's time to take this act on the road
Come back and get back on theâ€¦

[Chorus by Goapele]
You know I don't doubt you, I'll be there for you (I'll be there for you)
I'll be right beside you - just make your move (move)
You know I don't doubt you, I'll be there for you (just make your move)
I'll be right beside you - just make your move (move)

I'm leeee-e-eeaving; don't nobody worry
I'll be doing my damn thing quick-fast in a hurry
Dreamweaving
Keeping me and my team even
Shifting time zones, trying to see the seven seas and
Everything in between
We heavy and we heavenly so we love whatever we sing
From the banks of the Mississippi
To the shores of Tripoli we do more tours and wage wars, I'm
Swimming in women and living without limit
My penmanship got me on a trip spinning around the world
Bullshit aside, we're on a worldwide ride, right? (right... right... right)

[Chorus]
[Cas]
Damn baby, don't cry like that
I gotta get this money, ma, I'll be back
And he turned and walked into the world
Young man facing the land, chasing his dreams
Motivated by a picture of his daughters he embraced in his hand
Thinking what it might take him to win
And a 9 to 5 ain't supplyin' what he trying to drive
Locked up and got signed to Jive
For the deal got a quarter mil', shot back to the house on the hill
And blow some dough to show it's real
Flossed his wheels and lost his deal
But it's just a setback, ya boy got get back
Kept that ball rolling, God bless his Gs
Invest some cheese, and now they all rolling
Just doing what a man would do
Handle your business, or it'll handle you

[Pep Love]
I got a a vision of international pimping
I'm into natural women when I'm out traveling with my compadres
From Oakland to Auckland, we always walk and talk like we got game
I've traveled the canals of Venice
And aroused crowds in Sao Paulo with a single sentence
I penetrate the language barriers with positive vibes
And bridge gaps with raps, keeping my spirit alive and I've
Thrived, as I roam through zones
Collecting my paper with these poems and songs
Getting the girl, grabbing the money and running
Starting up companies and keeping the product coming
Hieroglyphics' adventures all around the globe
Mental enrichment, and we gotta get the dough!

[Goapele]
So go on and go where you wanna go
See what you wanna see
Be who you wanna be
You say, "Just trust me", and I do
You know it's just a phone call away
The chance ain't everyday
When folks get to do what they wanna do
And you got a winning hand to play

[Chorus by Goapele]
You know I don't doubt you, I'll be there for you (I'll be there for you)
I'll be right beside you - just make your move (move)
You know I don't doubt you, I'll be there for you (I'll be there for you)
I'll be right beside you - just make your move (move)

You know I don't doubt you, I'll be there for you (just make your move)
I'll be right beside you - just make your move (move)
You know I don't doubt you, I'll be there for you (I'll be there for you)
I'll be right beside you - just make your move (move)
