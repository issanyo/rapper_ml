(L.E.G.A.C.Y. Intro)

It's fear
Tell me something man, what you scared of
Word?
Yeah I know a lot people, scared of the same things
Fear

(1st Verse: L.E.G.A.C.Y.)

Is it boogie man, scary man
Bugs and needles
Clowns or plane crashed or thugs in tuxedos
Is it the fear of getting stuck by your people
Or is it the fear of being followed home
Are you scared of snakes like Indiana Jones
Vampire types, fear of stakes through the heart
Nick at Nite niggas, are you afraid of the dark
Who's under that bed or behind that door
Is it fear of being drafted, front line in a war
Is it fear dot com, or being shot
Kettle corn kernel, scared of being popped
You scared of the deep end
Drown in front of your people and can't reach them
Are you scared of spiders
Getting sent away and getting fucked by lifers
Fear like Mark Wahlberg, look at them they all scared
Are you scared to fly, are you scared to die

(Chorus: Edgar Allen Floe)

Fear, the enemy that makes you stand clear
Fear, the bad news intense to the ear
Fear, the road of life that you can't steer
Fear, the sense that your time is near

(Repeat)

(Sean Boog overlaps)

Yeah, I don't know man, it's got a hold on me
Fear
Sometimes, I just

(2nd Verse: Sean Boog)

Sometimes I wanna look up to the sky
With tears in my eyes
Question my greatest fear, why am I here to die
If there is an afterlife, what's it like
Is it heaven, is it what the reverend teaches us in church
Or is it eternal sleep, where we dream the worst
Or a bottomless pit at the end of the earth
Where a billion souls scream and ain't none of them heard
Or is it (NOTHING)
Silence, no peace or violence
No street sirens, evil, or God
Do we go somewhere we pay for sins
Or do we finally meet the one we prayed for sins
To be taken away, so we can join him in light
Are we stuck dwelling on our disappointments in life, shit
More that I write, I realize why I'm restless
My fear isn't death, it's not knowing where death is
And I guess it's
Shit I don't know

(Chorus x 2)

(3rd Verse: Edgar Allen Floe)

Yo
Reminiscing back in '84
Cruel shit I had to endure
Home Sour Home, rats on the floor
Life is poor, something that I can't ignore
There he go again, stealing from the corner store
I had big balls breaking and entering
Even as a young dude I practiced the sins of men
Family members wasn't off limits stealing that green paper
Had this fat knot, flashing at the teenagers
Ass whippings weekly, but nothing was beneath me
Wandering through each street, my ways stayed on repeat
Mommy's home, step dad is beating her
She live in hell, and I ain't making it easier
She punched through a glass window
Partially sliced wrist (damn)
That's when my life switched
Got to make her proud of me, and proceed to be a good brother
Shit is real, scared to death if I lose my mother

(Chorus x 2)
