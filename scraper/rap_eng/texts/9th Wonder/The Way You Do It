[Hook 2x]
Relax yourself, breathe easy cuz
We like the way you do. (inhale)
Relax yourself, breathe easy cuz
We like the way you do it. (Doin' what ya doin' baby)

[Verse 1: Phonte]
Yo, six minutes to showtime, I was out in the rain
Wit my nigga Big Pooh goin' over some thangs
No money in our pockets, just a buck and some change
Ran up in the hideaway wit niggas screamin' our name
Took the stage like a jet soarin'
Wildin' out wit the sweat pourin', til I woke up hoarse the next mornin'
An ill feeling that it brings about
To see niggas mouthin' yo words and you ain't even got a single out
On stage stealing yo' spot
It's the equivalent of ten adrenaline shots
Just like L.E.G.A.S.Y. and Sean Boog when they killin' the R.O.C
Ain't gotta worry 'bout if niggas just pretendin' it's hot
Cuz I can see their hands in the air wavin', heads bobbin'
Neck snappin' back and forth, 'bout to break dat shit
Man I appreciate dat shit
Thanks for showin' us love and to the top we fin' to take dat shit
Fa y'all

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Big Pooh]
I see ya'll cats wit yo' hands high
Up front shoutin' out the songs real loud, real proud
Lettin' every other person know
Who you came to see, who you came to rock for (Little Brother)
That's why we stay vibin', pens stay scribin'
Rims rotatin' to keep your soul pulsatin'
It's been a long time, but most folks still waitin'
All apologies, but thank you for stayin' patient
And die hard, that's why we try hard
Dig deep demand, so we supply y'all
Pushin' man, and we wanna keep you high far
From consent wit dis current state of hip hop
We know music, we know why some don't choose it
Y'all know the truth, I hope y'all don't lose it
Bullshit, everyday we all go through it
We givin' y'all some shit that's therapeutic
So Breathe easy y'all
