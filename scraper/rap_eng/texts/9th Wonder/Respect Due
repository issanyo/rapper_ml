[Verse One: Joe Scudda]
This is for my kids under light posts
Holding they fist tight, rocking Timberlands and they flight coats
For everybody up in the 'burbs
Go out, looking for trouble
Little kids stay smoking that herb
For everybody with stress on the nerves
You not alone
Just think of the kid when you're feeling you can't go on
My words will pull you through
That's like falling asleep at the wheel
And your shotgun rider gonna pull ya to
My stories are wild rides you better buckle up
Life's a fight man, you better knuckle up
Just keep swinging, never back down
If you know where you been, tell me where you at now
Stay focused
Help your mans if he hopeless
I know you got love for him, but make sure that he notice
Everybody gon' fall
We put you right back on your feet
You can't believe we got love for all of y'all

[Hook: Joe Scudda]
Respect due
Yo, for everybody struggling, shuffling
No matter what you do in life we always hustle
Respect due
Yo, for everybody trying to take it
In the streets, do ya thang, they just trying to make it

[Rapper Big Pooh]

[Verse Two: Rapper Big Pooh]
This is for my nigga with the big whip, American pimp
Clock doe from a couple chicks
Stuck in the mix now you serving a stint
I know the bing ain't shit to play with
But you gotta do it
I hope this scribe help my nigga through it
I hold you down till the day you release and we gon' get paid
Heaven made, spending time on the islands
It's G4 when we fly man
I mean, life ain't been the same since you been locked
I seen young niggas running the block and making shit worse
My heart hurts cause you stuck in the square
And I just can't see you there
Stay positive
I'ma right the wrongs with every song I pen
To make up for every time we sin
Me and you had problems and the came to an end
This shit for you J, let's do it again
This for my nigga
