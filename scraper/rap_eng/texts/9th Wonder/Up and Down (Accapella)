[Intro (Overlapped with Bridge 1): Cesar Comanche]
You know, life is funny sometimes.  You got your good times and your bad, but, regardless, no matter what happens, you gotta fight through that shit.  Word up

[Bridge 1 (Overlapped with Intro): Cesar Comanche] (x15)
Keep going, man (So no matter what)

[Verse 1: Cesar Comanche]
You know life is nonstop.  Building a strong case
You were moving up.  Now you getting the long face
Soon as you get up, be in search of your own space
It was feeling right.  Now you stuck in the wrong place
No free cheese in this rat race.  Ain't no
Bends as Stuart Littles are swimming laps in puddles
Of innocent rebuttals ‘cause you know life ain't
Circling in huddles.  It's real, it's never subtle
So find your mom and cuddle, bruh.  Highs and lows
Too much for ya—slow down, stick with the kiddie rides
Some dreams live.  Some dreams, they really died
So dig in and get teary-eyed if you want it
Some defeat their pride and some need to flaunt it
If you’re hot, well, I'm southern-fried, lacking
Herbs or mad spices.  The best at presenting
Me.  Reach goals ‘cause I really try

[Hook: Cesar Comanche]
It goes up with the flame and soars
It comes down—when it rain, it pours
Good to know it and you can't control it
So roll with punches.  Just roll with the punches
Those times when you win are sweet
It's bad when you taste defeat
Good to know it and you can't control it
So roll with punches.  Just roll with the punches

[Verse 2: Cesar Comanche]
You know time works in cycles, baby
You jump the gun if you’re quick to say, “We
Can't get a break” or “You can't delay we”
There's a left turn you can't see coming up
Don't waste your days of life running up
With your palms up to the sky, asking, "Why?"
Just keep in my shower today, destined to dry off
Keep on running at night, kite will fly up
To the top of the trees.  Trip, fall, put
Knots in your knees.  Brush off, re-
-act to the breeze.  Sit, wait, tell water to freeze
And you see it's way too late—hands are tied up
Even then, you’ve got to wiggle and fight
‘Til you're sliding your wrist just a little
Only natural now, then you're gonna be
Pissed.  Stay shaking your fist—it's a riddle

[Hook: Cesar Comanche]
It goes up with the flame and soars
It comes down—when it rain, it pours
Good to know it and you can't control it
So roll with punches.  Just roll with the punches
Those times when you win are sweet
It's bad when you taste defeat
Good to know it and you can't control it
So roll with punches.  Just roll with the punches

[Verse 3: Eternia]
Yo, fifteen, out on your own without a home to
Lay your head.  No bed, clothes, or phone too
Without a Plan B, now you’re exposed to
The elements.  It's frightening, it's Canada, and cold too
No one you're close to, so use your intelligence
Irrelevant, a situation is what you make of it
Now that you’ve got that freedom, it's time to live a bit
Love what you do and you must ‘cause you living it
Ill, right?  You’re breaking down stereotypes
The high school dropout that excelled on the mic
Excelled in the classes, excelled in the life
You can tell that I'm talking ‘bout myself when I write
But you’re hitting the ceiling—you gonna fall down
What goes up... yo, you know how the saying sounds
Ain't no way around it.  Life is just a downpour
Be sure to maintain, remain, and endure

[Hook: Cesar Comanche]

Good to know it and you can't control it
So roll with punches.  Just roll with the punches
