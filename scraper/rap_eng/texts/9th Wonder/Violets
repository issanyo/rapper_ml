[Chorus: Bianca Rodriguez]
Something so wonderful and new
A million colors just for you
It shines in everything you do
Like violets

[Phonte]
Yo
Blues and greens and violets
Eyes get
Heavy with the weight of the world
Around the iris

It’s like something insane
It’s like a virus
It’s like a hybrid
Of all your joys and your pains
That you bring to the table
Periodically
And memorize 'em like a scientist

For you to make it dawg
Ya gonna need alliances
A blessing and a prayer from the whole Archdiocese arch Diocese
[?]


Let’s put it to rest
Cuz I’m so in need of one
I only hear about it and never really seen it done
Everybody asking when I’m coming out
So when I run a route
I take the scenic one

To get away from all that ails me
I return to the place that never fails me
The hues spread the news
Giving color to your frailties

The blues and the greens and all that’s in between
And this is how I mean

One time

CHORUS
[Chorus: Bianca Rodriguez]
Something so wonderful and new
A million colors just for you
It shines in everything you do
Like violets

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Yo
Blues and greens and violets
Eyes get
Heavy with the weight of the world
Around the iris
So much that I be appalled to see ‘em
Close your eyes envision the cause for freedom
But when they open it’s a struggle to carpe diem
Cuz the streets is littered with niggas from mausoleums
Giving up is the last option
So when i spit my last doctrine
I make the audience clap for my offensive lines
Like they pass blocking
I really wanna chill
But I ain’t in that yet
Dont wanna live in excess
Think I need her tonight
Like INXS
But my mind is talking to me like
“Nigga don’t you send that text” (NO!)
Take time to introspect
So you can keep going
To get those checks
And give praises
Cuz never before have you been so blessed

[Pre-Chorus: Phonte]
When the troubles of the world
Start to ail me
I return to the place that never fails me
The hues spread the news
Giving color to your frailties
The blues and the greens and all that’s in between
Like that. Ride it out. Hey
The blues and the greens and all that’s in between
And this is how I mean

[Chorus: Bianca Rodriguez]
Something so wonderful and new
A million colors just for you
It shines in everything you do
Like violets
