That's my song, that's my song, that's my song

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
I ain't the next Ms HILL
I ain't the next him or her, I'm just the one y'all feel
Got a 9th Wonder deal
NC rappers mad at us
Y'all think backwards, part of a guild of rappers
Everything I write a movie
But I ain't no actor
Im just one lonely woman, and there's just one factor
It's my path and mine to walk alone
Star Trek (track), I run that but I ain't chasing Khans (cons)
9th wonder flipped this song a few years ago
But it's okay cuz I got two or three of those to go
And already I hear mumblings of Manigault
Call her earl cuz I'm sicker girl, she terminal
I'mma killer on these beats to these streets
I had a chat wit Dot about the lyrics being deep
He told me you unique just find ya melody and speak on it
You ain't gotta tote a gun to put some heat on um
So here I am mourning
Another life I'mma take
To be a part of your life every morning that you wake like

[Mela Machinko]
That's my song, that's my song, that's my song

[Rapsody]
They gon play every morn
I ain't Vince Vaughn but its break up season
She got summer you gone hate for no reason
And again I ain't Lauryn, but I fuckin will leave um
Like you just lost one muthafucka believe it
Watching battles of the Raine (rain)
Can't lie that line Persia spit bout Sandy was insane
Welcome to the game yall this is how it be
You gon win some and lose some success is never free
Thats what I'm hearing lately
I'mma get rich off of this or go have Bieber baby
Ha!
Just lyrical fun
And then itâ€™s right back to spitting
Writing over these drums bout
How niggas dumb and they dont think I'mma make it
Cuz they don't see the trend and who listing as favorites
And I ain't mad about that XXL
I'm bigger than a cover, I want billboard sales
A Thursday afternoon and it raining hard
Im sittin in the car cuz its quiet, I need space to spar
Y'all know it's me
And if you don't then pronounce my name R-A-P
My mama try and say my name and always mess it up
But it's alright I'd just rather be Marlanna to her
I'm from a small country city where they dream hard
In 91 when Eric died it left us all scared
I had a dream I met Lauryn Hill we had a heart to heart
She told me how to play the industry and keep my heart
9th Wonder already told me, tho
I know it's possible he already showed me, so

Finally, the sky stopped crying
Can't say same tho brothers still lying
Just today Observed the news and I ain't like what I saw
When youngins try and blame another one for de flaws

My sister feel some way about my income
And how long it's taking me to really get some
But don't worry it's gone come
We almost out the tunnel I can almost see the sun, but it's a
Thursday afternoon and its raining hard
Im Sittin in the car cuz its quiet I need space to spar
Y'all know it's me
And if you don't then pronounce my name R-A-P
