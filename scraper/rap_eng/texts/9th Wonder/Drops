[Intro]
Let's go
9th Wonder

[Verse One]
While you wondering what Leg is thinking
Leg is thinking what you wondering
Drinking, I'm down under and
Thoughts of wild money, Crocodile Dundey
Shit he's waving, now that's a knife
Shit he's saying, now that's the trife
Ugly ass don't touch me ass nigga with attitude
Still rap for you, might seem I'm against you
Then it might seem we're friends too
It's two sided, ain't none of that hide
I don't give a shit who writes it
Choose beats or choose riots, want organized street gang shit
Real like democracy, we can claim this
Who run it? With a mafia like Tres 6
Who want it? I'll drop on you and break shit
Ugh
I'll drop on you and break shit

[Hook] x2
Drops
You love it when it drops, and cops?
I don't give a fuck about the cops, and pops?
Been a problem since I busted outta pops, and watch?
You have no choice but to watch

[Verse Two]
It was roll on point, everytime I spoke on joints
Take it to the farthest extent, stayed on target with hits
While you way off
I cut your foot off, then wrap it in Kinte cloth
Badly wounded
Born to the world, then madly consumed it
Destruction appetite, clutching my past life
People acting like animals, evil acting hungry cannibals
A fool born
A unicorn's horn torn
Our population, wants more porn
NC-17 obscene, reading graffiti under the bridge
Trap
But speaking freely I just wanna live
Puff marijuana tulips, wit a crush on Ananda Lewis
She's so pretty
But Leg he's so gritty
She could never love me, L-E-G is too ugly
Beauty and the Beast, truly
I'm a Beast
A monstrosity
Who can drop with me?

[Hook] x2

[Verse Three]
Animal girls hands touching on him, it's one zoo
Animal world busted condom, I come through
Only see black white like nuns do
Honestly, mad at life redrum you
Everything you done once, I've done two
Treat you like Isaiah, and Son you
Teach you the way, look what I've done true
180 spun you
Made you hate me, then made you embrace me
In many cities, got plenty shitty and cost a pretty penny
You can't afford me
Some against me, some support me
Like abortion, play the game of prize and fortune
Stay the same, alive when the war ends
Charlie Sheen in platoons, San's son
I got a rivalry with the moon, publicize it soon
Will join in illustrations, to avoid litigations
I switched identities, LFK they still try to get the Kennedys
Try to assassinate me
The last of the great MCs, similar to Mohicans
Might see me in the spot slow freaking, a chick with her flesh hanging out
John Henry shit
Leg's banging out

[Hook] x2
