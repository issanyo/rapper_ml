[Scratches]
You’re the type of girl that I been dyin’ to meet

[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
Yo listen, tonight will be exquisite
Behold the beneficent garment
Stitched from the best seamstress
Persian gold woven silk threading
Diamond red rubies in my crown heading
Clark Wally boots sway with the French braid
Preparing for the greeting
Peace princess you truly are a jewel to behold
I would love to have you as my guest, serving you the best
Watching you unwind the pleasure’s all mine
While I’m tasting your sweet words of seduction
And sexual tones I was wondering if I take you home
Would you roll and light my bone for me
I’m in the zone while I’m watching you dance
And I’m thrown by your passionate moans
And the sounds making me

[Hook] (Scratches)
So glad I found you
(You’re the type of girl that I been dyin’ to meet)

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Oh she so sexy and she so sweet
This hot little mama I was (dyin’ to meet)
Oh indeed you are, yes beautiful Comanche squad
My starship taking you up
And I’m loving how you flexing
When you stepping in the lobby
Queen royal lioness allow me to express
Your smelling be delicious
Bringing out my hot cool and vicious
Well built butter soft skin hair silk
Intelligent profession, paralegal on your hustle
You need a man to hold you down every now and again
And love you like a genuine friend

[Verse 3: HaLo]
My Nubian princess, Arabian incense
All beyond a set, let me collect my thoughts
They so scattered when you not around
Hear you loud and clear when there’s not a sound
Your humble cocky walk when your body talk
Cute little socks, I’ma knock ‘em off
The soft curve of your smile
Her thighs are like the banks of the Nile
And most cats wanna bend your friends
Not me, I play it cool, never mention them
Check, you got a name for our daughter yet?
Thinking of Nina maybe Juwayriya
My hands rubbing on her area
Her first nine months will be
You and me got something special going
The love our ancestors are knowing
The family is growing baby
