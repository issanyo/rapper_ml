[Verse 1: XL]
Swear shit is mad crazy
I just pray that God saves me
And if he don't I guess he might as well slay me
I pave the, Earth when I walk with just the shirt that I bought
RP though, never saw his art
It's like Noah crashed the arc in my city now the zoo loose
I hit the blunt reminisce bout kush and zulus
Who knew that I would make it this far?
I be killing birdies, y'all be staying on par
Press the On-Star, they can't even save your life
Ask if anyone can spare a knife, like the Red Line
Would spend dimes, she got blue eyes, no Aryan though
Everybody got bad calls, I'm tryna hear you fold
The stories been told, the scrolls been rolled, them O's been blown
That shit's not new to me
Nobody like my mind state but failed to break through to me
I need Hazeus to come back just to tutor me
Tell me bout these snakes in my path to greatness
Tell me how awards ain't nothing but fake shit
Because I know what my goals are in this life
It's the others tryna catch bolts flying the kites
Who supply the dice? I'm tryna make it big
I'm tired of dark nights ripping the cig
This shit get real big when you make it in society
My biggest fear is getting played kill anyone that lie to me
Name known around the globe, guess the buzz real
And pussies out cutting throats over drug deals
So it's kill or be killed, or escape and save face
Amazed i can beat death at such a young age
Assured me we would blow together
Didn't know those were your last days
But that's the past paid

[Hook: XL]
Spark mics like too precise
Shit darker without the lights
Word is bond, carry on
I gotta stay true to life
(Gotta stay true to life)
I gotta stay true to life
(Gotta stay true to life)
I gotta stay true to life
