[Verse 1] Ill Bill

One percenters and five percenters
Album outlines the center
Rapping knives and the Berettas, the lies and vendettas
Trials of menace to society is brainwashed
Brain drops, nervous rooks cops with itchy trigger fingers spraying Glocks
And frustrated rappers sometimes swear
Waving Mac 11s you either buy my CD or die in the streets
Sometimes I feel like I was born on Doomsday
Then I think about my daughter
And the future and pray that these moods change
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
Get on your knees, I brought a guillotine to put your heads
Essential, the essence, always carry a deadly presence
Destined to be revolutionary with every sentence
I been the one to pull the card on frauds
Put them in their place, drop the bomb and start the war
The fuck you think we brought these rocket launchers for?
Not to brag about the way we pop Techs
Ill Bill, Sadat X, who got ?

[Hook]

A lot of y’all got the whole game confused
The tricknology got me blowing a fuse
I don’t know these dudes, they can’t sport these shoes
They ain’t show you the truth, they ain’t paid no dues

A lot of y’all got the whole game confused
The tricknology got me blowing a fuse
I don’t know these dudes, they can’t sport these shoes
They ain’t show you the truth, they ain’t paid no dues

[Verse 2] Sadat x

The backbone sets the overall tone
We soldiers, dude, and ain’t even standin’ straight up or weightless
Listen, I ain’t gon’ debate this
How you win the case when your shit is all over the place?
Who’s your co-signer? It must’ve been a minor
Bill is ill, ain’t no feelings heartbeat
Dudes left the Apple while we stay in the heat
Cause we love to compete, that’s what gladiators do
They say they love blood, dirty sick but
Vietnam tactics, spikes in the mics
In the States turnpikes is reduced
? after nine hours for the cake can make me stay awake
I’m not concerned with who earn
I need my stacks to blow
When I be hearing some of these records
I don’t really know these dudes, I’m not a fad thief
And I’m original pattern, one of one
After the needle line is done, the educated sniff a dollar
The rest still suck from the breast and keep nursing
Don’t be that person (never that)

[Hook]
