Shorty hit the brakes too late
Shorty hit the brakes too late
Shorty hit the brakes too late

[Verse 1: Phonte]
Hey yo rollin out the crib about a quarter to six
Fresh Timbs, bubble goose all in the mix
Y'all niggas know my steez and how crazy I get
I'm looking for the broad shaking ass and tits
I got the J League banging hard out the whip
Picked up the phone and hit my nigga Pooh on his hip
Hey yo these chicks around here ain't tryna give me no play
They mad at my verse from Whatever You Say
Yo sorry about the shirt I'll hit you with pay
You still rocking that punch from the video day
We 'bout to take it over to where Median stay
Just bounce to the beat bounce, rock and sway

[Hook: Phonte & Median]
Shorty hit the brakes too late
[P:] Looking at me cause I am just keeping it thorough
Shorty hit the brakes too late
[P:] And every state, every city, every town and girl
[M:] And to my freaks in it (c'mon) and the fam in it (c'mon)
And the ladies in it (c'mon) it's all gravy in it (oohhh)

[Verse 2]

[Phonte]
Hey that nigga Median ain't never at home
He trying to be a player like Romey Rome
Probably at a coffee shop trying to bone
Gassing up these chicks like Sharon Stone
Got these young broads thinking that they grown
Nigga need to go and get a cellular phone

[Median]
It's mid-December in here
Seventy degrees and the skies are clear
Feel's so good like Davina in here
Do them stars and them stripes mean the ending is near
No time got evicted got a crib to clear
Move on don't stop house parties and all
And we going to ball 'til the break of dawn

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Median]
Probably think I be playing with this
I can hear them niggas Pooh and Phonte in this shit
If only they could know a brother holding it down
Grinding for the day that we controlling it now
To the break of dawn, to the break of dawn
Flow's hot just open up your mind baby
The blind lead the blind make the grind crazy
Why maybe just co-signed baby
Median would like to know your mind baby
J Lizzy is about to blow your mind baby
Lunch time, crunch time, punch line baby
Our time now what is that a crime now baby

[Hook]
