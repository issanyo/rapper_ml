[Verse 1]
Flyer then my mother loving dress code
West Coast see what I be packing in my trench coat
Banging on my head like a motherfucking psycho
She paid me I ain't tryna come up in no lady
Lately I've been go crazy like go
Tell these niggas quit bitching and suck it up lypo
This is like a sexual assault with a dildo
Concrete chop it up and stick it in a bimbo
This is like osama tryna shave on a rainbow
Grab his bitch and make her get wet like a raincoat
Vicodin inject and getting higher then billboard
Still go rocking side kicks like I feel good

[Hook]
Oh lord Oh na na na
I be going high
I be taking flights
To places you've never seen before, ya see me

[Verse 2]
Tell me where's the hugo
Chillin with my chinese friend name Agugo
He will chop you up and see you softer then a poodle
We use your bitch so much I think we change her name to Google
Ass in the back looking fatter then a fucking sumo
Yeah, so now you feel like you wanna frisk me
You can never catch me
Higher then a frizby your girl say you limpy
She try to keep you up and all you do is stay wimpy
Bitch please ding dong long like a santa pee
Sucker Garden all the way down to Front street
You will never know another nigga like me
I'm the motherloving illest like I'm pulling on trees
Home made heating up the crack
Sitting in a pot
Never love a rat face looking like a predator
Ass tryna plank men and black no edgar
No thank you all we do is get paid
Getting laid this is what you spin like a bey blade
Same way tell them haters better make way
Fake ways penetrate tell em what the hook gon be
Cause you know what the hook gon be
What the hook gon be

[Hook]
Oh lord Oh na na na
I be going high
I be taking flights
To places you've never seen before, ya see me

Early in the morning
Early in the morning lord
