Panic! Situation is frantic
I don’t got time for mantics
Defense mode: Mantis
Peep advantage
It ain't been this sad ‘round here
Since the last time liquor banished
I’m gonna pop a Xanax
Not that I ought to, just thought to
Won’t affect me much unless my stomach’s gone nauseous
A higher pertaining; I’m bathing in conscious
I’m calling you a zombie. That’s a dead man walking
I’m walking tall off alcohol
Baby go on led me into bathroom stall
Had my boots knocking dawg
Master of a cover-up as if she was a shawl
And I am just a shaman
Real life story Untouchable turned Brahmin
Real life story Untouchable turned Brahmin
And I am just a deity
Disraeli Gears and Physical Graffiti
And I’m still shifting gears whether or not you hear me
Hard truth make a nigga see clearly
There ain’t a motherfucker, motherfucker near me
Drink Pabst, smoke blunts, and start steering
Momma in the back saying, “What is that weird thing?”
That’s when I pressed recline
Our matter of fact has now turned separate lines
My horoscope’s a feline
Guess that’s why I never really got too much me time
Waking up in the morning, I call it weed time
Words you use, you could choose to define
And I choose me
Make a bitch cheese harder than properly baked ziti
And who am I?
I am just a shaman
Real life story Untouchable turned Brahmin
Catch me on Ocean or Collins
Fucking with a villain have you swimming with the dolphins
I ain’t no Christian. Dumb nigga, fuck a coffin!
Knowledge for half-off
A motherfucker came and got his ass blast off
I’m on Mission: Mars
I see the biggest picture. I’m watching from afar
