[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you
(I bet you I was only thinkin' if I)
If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you
(You know I can't do nothin' with you)
You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth
No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Say, I should take this heart and pawn it at the auction
I don't need it, I'mma slay this bitch and take ya shoppin'
'Cause what good is any heart if it can break in pieces?
I would rather have no feelings, than cryin' and sobbin'
When I met you, I was broke as the rope on the faucet
I had dreams that I would blow like a Nintendo Cartridge
I was hungry, I was dirty, I needed a shower
Said you fed me, and you clothed me, you packed me a sack lunch
Papa said, "When I get older, get a girl like your momma"
But I'm twenty (cough) years old and runnin' out of options
How I'm supposed to trust ya?
Ain't you one of them ones tryin' to run up
Pose for the perfect picture, upload and post it?
Question: Is you with me or not?
I'm from the city where they wear bikinis in the water drought
But I'm used to having cyclones blown in and out of my life
So it's no biggie if you need time to figure it out

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you
(I bet you I was only thinkin' if I)
If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you
(You know I can't do nothin' with you)
You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth
No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
You know you wrong, shit you out of pocket
Remember you was couch surfin', you ain't have a casa
And mi casa, I would buy you shoes from out the locker
Even though I heard around the town from all the gossip
Between they legs and slidin' limousines in garages
Heard your mama cheated on ya daddy, you just like her
Karma come around, remember what happened to Tiger
Game over, dead wrong, Biggie Wallace
I was the one you counted on before you stacked your wallets
Talkin' 'bout me, motherfucker, you the one with problems
Haha, you played yourself for a photo that you ain't know though
I only took from niggas trying to slide up in the DM
And show 'em I was happy with the nigga I was seein'
But you fucked up, stupid, so I guess I'll go and see 'em
As you contemplate how to get me back like Liam
No fuckin' tonight, I'll be gone by the PM nigga

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you
(I bet you I was only thinkin' if I)
If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you
(You know I can't do nothin' with you)
You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth
No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you

[Outro: Nai Palm]
Might not get, might not get any better
Might not, might not get, might not get any better
Might not, might not get
