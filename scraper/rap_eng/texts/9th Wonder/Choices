Hook
It's just me and the choices I make (x8)

Verse one
Pulled up a seat at the table, sent them invites out
A couple days later, got a feast for the mind and the spirit
I’d be lying if I said I weren’t concerned about my image
But it’s more so the way I look … at things
Scars make the art or destroy your skin
Beauty in deception that’s a lying King
Running from myself got this one way ticket, ticket
Out of here to a place that I don’t really know
It’s funny I’m still looking for a place that I can call home
Meanwhile my friends are tryna find the one to bring home
I must be in a different time zone
I’m moving at a pace that I can’t describe
It’s bigger than being blasé
I feel to fight everything I was ever taught
I’m in search of a true revelation
One of self, that’s a realisation

Verse two
Shifting my priorities at every teardrop
Every heart break, singing when will this stop
It’ self-healing, self-righteous, self-inflicting
I’m so conflicted
I love and I hate all in the same breath
I move and I don’t all in the same step
The diaspora of my people made me realise we aren’t equal in the eyes of another man
Look at how they took us from our own land (damn)
We literally started from the bottom
Saw our parents grind 4 seasons over 2 decades
No wonder everyone around me is a go getter
Said if you know better, then you will do better
Like my my my, this is our time
And the hunger doesn’t lie no it doesn’t lie
Came from the underground but what I am without drive
6 gears on the transmission I’ll be flying by

It's just me and the choices I make (x8)
