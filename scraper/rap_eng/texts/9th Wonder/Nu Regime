[Intro]
You been spitting
You been spitting all night my nigga
This shit sound like a fuckin' fight song
This that fight music
Not that type of fight music though
Not in that manner, not that way
Naw not me

[Verse 1]
Its a new day
Which means its a new regime
And I'm the head of my team
Like I'm LeBron James
Why the fuck does my palms keep itching?
I guess that billion I was plotting on
I'm bout to get it
And I'm dressed for the occasion
Rockin' B.B.C. ho
Black girl say she wanna rock my mic
That's a B.E.T. ho
Get it?
If you don't, you a idiot
And you probably, illiterate
Can't read between the lines
Man the diary of a wimpy kid
Rapping boutta life they never lived
Such a fib
But if it makes money
Then I guess it make sense
But I ain't rockin' with them
I get my inspiration from
Niggas like hustlers and pimps
I got the power of Tyson
And I float like I'm Ali
I'm trynna be the G.O.A.T
Have them people praise me
Young enough to be the little brother
Of some of ya
Be rappin' like my age don't exist
Since nine bruh
Diamonds and women
I like that top of the line shit
So if she my bitch
She the fuckin' line leader
You the type to get rich
And get married like Wiz Khalifa
I'm the type to get rich
And live like Wilt
Every time I drop a verse
The motherfuckin' world tilt
By the time I drop my album
We'll be right next to Saturn
Patterns?
I got em'
Nigga these rhyme schemes
Is mean
My throw away raps
Is hot enough to be clean
Spring
To the top
Give em' all that I got
And I know my guardian angel
Gone watch
Pops
I got you
Wonder if heaven got a clock?
I'll stop
When my heart not
Beatin' no bass
And the ones I left behind
Is feedin' they face
With all the money I made
Boy I be spazzin' like
I never had no home training...
I don't complain I just maintain
And grind
So one day
I can proclaim the throne as mine
