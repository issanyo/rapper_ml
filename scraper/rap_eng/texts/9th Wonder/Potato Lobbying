[Verse 1: Bro Sampson]
The new mic got me soundin' too crispy
Choose quickly, revolution who's with me?
Nobody, one deep in an old trolley
Low ammunition on a mission to blow shottys
Man I'm spitting live from the kitchen like Yo Gotti
Got a white girl on my hip and she so snobby
But that don't really change my opinion I'm no Romney
Just a Cold commie dancin' my way through the whole lobby
On my Ellen shit, the generous degenerate
The cheddar fish and Kevin is who I'm steppin' with
The president takin' shots at yo residence
And you better live to tell the story to your friends and shit
That dude, I'm never him, cause I always see the glass half empty
Always got the cash stacks with me, yeah right I wish
But that's the reason that I'm doing this shit
For a little pocket change and to be cooler than him
And by him, I mean the next guy
Growing up in Bed-Stuy waiting to get that check signed by his rep
I absolutely hate it, cats are truly racist the way they got us competing just to see who can make it
I mean I got talent, but I don't got time
And I'm not the one to be singing on no soap op rhymes
So I take a step back, on to the next track
Got these people noddin' they heads until they neck crack
When I drop my tape you be sure you better check that
In the tenth lap and I'm running until my legs stop
