[Intro]
Check, check
Like say love
What you made of
What's your name love
You like the same stuff
Stuff, maybe exchange numbers
Maybe a date love, I'm sayin'
Yo, I think I prayed for a lady like you
Ah ha you, you

[Verse 1 - Enigma]

Mocha skin, cocoa butter rub it in
Them other men, into that other shit
And really, they don't have a clue
Ha, you got the essence of a young Coretta
Scott, go 'head ma, do what you do
This is my letter to you
Hope you read it
Easy on the minds, inspire the ???
Tell the truth, maybe you can inspire me too
To be great, and we lay and we mate
And we may can paint the sky too
Give me a try, give me a shot
They call you Ms. Scott
Call you my little 'Retta
The classy type, I'm your prince
You're my cinderella, no one can it betta
This is my letta to you

[Verse 2 - Sundown]

Sweet like caramel butterscotch
This is my letter, to my personal Coretta
Go getter, got it locked watch
Lock and key, never stop, hold me down
I'm surrounded by a flock of those
Hungry for my sound
Apply pressure, Coretta got my back
So when they front, I relax
Plus she stack like a brickhouse
Sweater style cardigan, picked out to match
With them jeans, I was targeted, and cupid
Got a good aim, shot to the heart
Start a game of arhcery, target me a mark
With hearts, on my sleeve, strange
Same game like them broom jumpers play
So we try to keep pace, but life
Moving like a bullet train
Both want change, like a broken dollar
We got to represent to lead, like we need
Hope the people follow
Throw an iron at my heart, trying to kill my iron will
I'm an iron man, I will stand
On Capitol Hill, non-violent
Hit the violins, means to an end
Me and you, let the record spin

[9th Wonder dialogue, harmonies]

Need to come on a get little plate or something
(A Letter to Coretta)
Fix me a little lima beans, you know, put on the plate there
(A Letter to Coretta)
Little collard green up there, little macaroni and cheese or something
(A Letter to Coretta)
Gimme some of that fried liver, some of them rolls a little bit something
(A Letter to Coretta)
Some of that potato salad, put it on the side there
(Be my Miss Coretta)
Want a piece of aluminum foil, put on top of there like
(A Letter to Coretta)
Some of that sweet potato pie so I can chase it down with it
(A Letter to Coretta)
Some of that ice tea, some of that Lipton, something like that
(A Letter to Coretta)
Girl, this that shol' after church plate right here
(A Letter to Coretta)
Come on girl! Put some more food on the plate
Quit playing being shy with food on the plate now
Girl, you make your own gravy
You make your own gravy
