INTRO
The sun is in the sky but I refuse to smile (sample)
Mommy I hope you still smiling....it's your son, still shine but I refuse to smile!

VERSE 1!
The goes the phone alarm / then the morning yawn / Followed by that groggy walk / wish I could sleep some more / I shower with thought hoping nothing will go wrong / A black slave that can't escape this rat race / I'm late for the office / and already exhausted / The heavy traffic equals the weight of the problems / I carry cos maths only educate on x / You think it's early for that? / Not for everyone man / I fail to understand how whites fake it for blacks / Gaining more wealth / while our race is jobless / Can't maintain and afford this expensive life / Credit is high / babies die it makes me cry / What does it take to smile? / Nelson's was perfectly wide / While racism is alive / It makes me angry inside / But just a friendly smile then everything is fine!

HOOK!

We still shining out here man, it's still shining in my world!

VERSE 2!
The sun is in the sky / still struggling to smile / A hungry child that was blessed with a hustling mind / Cos mommy survived bellow poverty lines / So funny that I ain't even laughed in a while / Giggle to this tune ha, ha if the feeling is mutual / I get a chance to smile each minute I refuse one / I don't even get how Chester Missing amuse ya / A serious dude who's just building a future / When I'm at home I'm found to always be so down / Low to the ground / mostly with folks around / Known to frown / I could smile if you showed me how / If there is ever time to I'm told it's now / With 23 approaching / I feel a bit older / I need to focus / The reason I'm a loner is I feel no one but me and the mirror are closer man!

Even my friend refuses to smile man!

VERSE 3!
From morning to mid-day / been longing for a grinned face / Well I know it takes more muscles to keep straight / "Just smile a little" I'm ignoring that clich√© / Don't need a reason to smile / but I'm inquisitive why / Why am I living this life? / It's a blessing, is it? / I ain't pessimistic / I'm just bad at grinning / It has been a minute for which since I had a reason / I'm mostly an angry kid / A joke a medicine / a dose imperative / But I lead a serious lifestyle / Ridiculous I ain't smile since Jesus was my guide / But I realized God is me inside / I'm personally blessed with breath and heart in my chest / I gotta relax / and just take it easy / Play some Wizzy / Nah I ain't that cheesy!
