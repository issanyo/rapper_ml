[Intro: Phonte, (sample)]
(How can it be)
Oh we get started up one more time
(She wrote her number down, it's here in front of me)
I got the number down right here
I'm looking at it
I couldn't believe she would do me like that, P
(Don't understand) I just don't understand it dog
Can't understand it (she must have told me a lie)
Ladies and gentleman (I wonder why)
Wanna welcome y'all back to The Minstrel Show
Thank y'all for tuning in
Y'all keep watching a lotta the station
But y'all touring us right now
And it feels so beautiful
Performing at black face tonight
It's my nigga, Joe Scudda
Coming up a little bit later on in the show
I just wanna thank y'all for just tuning in
It's like this yo

[Verse 1: Phonte]
Yo, when 'Te pulls his verses out
Promoters pull their purses out
That, money for a purchase out
The charge card that they swipe for the worst amounts
'Cause this is business, not personal
Thought that I would switch my personnel
Like Big Dho and Big Pooh would be the first to bounce
But y'all niggas is boring me, I'm never gon' change up, please
Join a sorority, go step your game up
Y'all boys ain't ready for damage, you need extra planning
You in the game, but you off-sides and got an extra man
And I'm the coach doing your reprimanding
I got a team to run, boy, respect my standards
And when I'm on the mic, y'all should expect the grandest
Showing lyricism, ever let 'em know who your man is
It's Phon-Tigga

[Refrain: Phonte]
Don't stop, can't stop, yes I want it
So gutter
Can't stop, won't stop, yes I love it
Little Brother
Don't stop, can't stop, yes I want it
And all across the world, the fly ladies and girls, tell me they loving it
Can't stop, won't stop, yes I love it
Don't stop, can't stop, yes I want it
East Coast say they loving it
Can't stop, won't stop, yes I love it
Midwest say they loving it
Don't stop, can't stop, yes I want it
All worlds say they loving it
Can't stop, won't stop, yes I love it
It's rapper Big Pooh

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
I got a prob with, niggas speaking gossip
Talk about what you know, nothing, it is nonsense
That's a Bronson, Charlie take precaution
Get you sold on the block, no not an auction
Dearly departing
I'm not a G but I move like they move
With a head full of smarts man
Here these niggas go rambling
Cause they don't know about the business we be handling
But let em know
Constant hits keep 'em scrambling
'Til the stores, 'til the shelves dismantling
And what's that joint 9th sampling
Pooh and Te on the mic, them bastards them
And your women, we attracting them
And if you ever wanna know what's happening
We tell em

[Refrain: Phonte]
Don't stop, can't stop, yes I want it
(It sounds so good)
Can't stop, won't stop, yes I love it
(It's so hood)
Don't stop, can't stop, yes I want it
(From the state to state, them boys making the papers and yeah we lovin' it)
Can't stop, won't stop, yes I love it
Don't stop, can't stop, yes I want it
West Coast say they loving it
Can't stop, won't stop, yes I love it
East Coast say they loving it
Don't stop, can't stop, yes I want it
Southwest say they loving it
Can't stop, won't stop, yes I love it
It's Joe Scudda!

[Verse 3: Joe Scudda]
I wake up every morning holding my dick
Going through life like I know I'm the shit
Y'all ain't fucking with me
So why try, why go that route
Why take that street
You can't take that heat
Man your whole flow weak
We will take that beat
Put our own words on it
We will make that speak
To the crowds and the masses and all I ask is
Don't settle for the average rap cabbage-
Heads; yeah you heard what I said we the best here
Cause our worst days be better than your best years
We your worst fears
So get up, get out and get something man
It's only getting worse here
Joe Scudda, Little Brother, man we family
And we here forever so understand me

[Refrain]
