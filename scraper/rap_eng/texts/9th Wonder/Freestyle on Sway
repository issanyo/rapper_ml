Ayo, my alphabetic arsenal and awesome arithmetic
Are actually attributes adding artistic apprenticeship
Absolutely an animal, accurately articulate, academically acrobatic
Attaching an apparatus, advancing attacking average assassins and agonizing
Antagonists analyzing analytical analyst, analysis, algebraic astrologist
Approximately assile, accomplished archaeologist, anatomically agile
Assesive aberration, abrasive application, abandoned, I'm straight A's listen
Listen, listen, listen, listen
I beat the mic like vike and lean ya, treat the mic like Ike and Tina
Feed a dyke my pipe then leave her, see the ice on the bright then clean her
Jesus Christ Sway, I'm like a fever, I'm on fire
I blaze the place, make sure my waves is straight
Then play the custom made beige and grape bathing apes
If you on fire I'ma smash your single
'Cause I'm tryna' get Starbucks, and I don't mean cappuccino
While you sleep, I'ma hold the pistol, under your nose
And watch it wake you up like its Folgers crystal
Better get your thin scratch together
When I battle it's a show, so I'm dropping ten stacks or better
I'm the best, nigga, you got nerve
If I pop my trunk, it be two K's then you got served
See I gotta keep the fifth and his twin brother
Pack enough heat to turn Michael his original skin color
Bitches call me papi, I give em the pipe
I got the sickest charm rocky, frigid with ice
And my six is all cocky, kitted with pipes
New edition like Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike
Yeah they call me the squad killa
Everything I say is hot
Sway, I spit flames harder than Godzilla
Got a gun named Moses, I'm in the club with it
'Cause it could part the red C on your Cubs fitted
I'll embarrass and smash a man
Ayo Sway, I'm on fire the like the American flag back in Pakistan
Runnin' your trap and I'ma bang you in it
And leave you stiff like you just put on your jacket, man
Look, don't send the shook type to challenge me
My whole crew full of stars, so from afar we look like a galaxy
I ain't bigger than anybody, skinny in that big body
But when I spit, I feel like Big in a skinny body
Sig and a mini shotty
Dig for them digits papi
Before I pop and leave your wig and your fitted sloppy
I'm a motherfucking giant, how a midget top me?
Mini-me ass niggas copy but spit it sloppy
Son of a gun, I think the fifth did adopt me
And named me time, cause nothing in this bitch could stop me
I distribute on the block, when I pivot watch me
I'm in a drop, how you riding in a Civic cocky
Man the chicks I poke would grab your cash up
And the shit y'all smoke, I rather pass up
Rules to the block, don't ever change
I'm way out of your range
You a canoe I'm a yacht, I'm a zoo you a fox
You a cube I'm a box, I'm a jewel you a rock, listen
Niggas couldn't last in my trenches
The wrath of my vengeance is drafted through the dramatic craft of my sentence
I'm a bastard who's illest, disastrous limits, sporadic, maniac rapper
Matched with a chemist, attached with Olympic spectacular swag in my image
A tactical menace administer massive afflictions
I had a vision a prediction, a vast premonition
Of cashing the tradition of my last intuition
I craft with precision, I've mastered division in math to add addition
If it clashed with decision; Sway, I had it with this shit
I'm sick of battling babbling graduates in fad of a battered arithmetic
Vigorous heart, I'm ridiculous smart, my intelligence ends
Where my curriculum starts, centripecal force of art multiplied by thought
Equals the action of the fraction of describing my part
I'm the critical, critical, political pinnacle
You're a minimal, minuscule, cynical interlude
I will finish, diminish you, the minute you send it through
I'm the Dennis the Menace of the men that you sent it to
I replenish the sentence with a pen in the interview
In the Guinness for hindering pretenders and ripping dudes
With versatile progression, plus I stayed on beat like I just got took off
For a personal possession
This verse is just a lesson for the service and the questions
And I'm purposely addressing niggas searching for direction
Scar told me, death ain't nothing but birth in reverse
If you end up hurting me first, I throw the hearse in reverse
Then disperse a verse in reverse, without rehearsing it first
Illest nigga alive, I put these jerks in the dirt
My verse two, hurt you worse than my first do
But my verse three, that's way worse than my verse two
So to verse me, that's revert in a virtue
Remember when I spit that verse in reverse
That verse is killing me
Who wanna be the first to adverse my versatility, nigga feel me
I say I'm hotter than a devil with a fever, wearing a leather and a beater
And a sweater while he eating a jalapeno fajita
With a book bag full of heat pads, with a skully on and a ski mask
With the heat on, in an E-class, at Exxon with a speed pass
I'm rippin' and runnin' and grippin' the tech
And one of these labels gonna give me your check
If you giving me problems I'm getting you wet
If you did it, I done it so give me respect
King!
