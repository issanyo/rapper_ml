[Verse 1: Novej]
She spoke to me in braille
The way she felt, I won't go in detail
Between the lines of the letter's she mail
But what the hell, she said her man's in jail
Like a champion takin' an L, not well, down on himself
Being around, I can help pitch in
Do more than just hear me baby doll
Listen, my grandmomma raised 11 alone
Dearly beloved, poppa's heaven was home
So with the one you got, you gotta be strong
Other side of that phone
Your confidante, heard you pour your heart out
You grew impatient if he ever got out
You tried one mo' 'gin
Despite the fact you back with some ol' friend
That Love Jones, you hope it don't grow intense
He didn't give you doe for the rent
He gave up by keepin' this here up
A Capricorn we were born, yup
Unless God forbid, already hard as is
Another kid, not one of 'em his
I did us a favor and prayed for us all last night
A few problems of my own and say I don't act right
'Bout the decisions I made, why I'm livin' this way
Take the time to write a rhyme about me, what would you say?

[Hook]
Your kisses, speak in love
The sweetest language that I know
Oh
Your kisses, speak in love
The sweetest language that I know
Oh

[Verse 2: Big Remo]
Let's play a game of 21
Or we can play teams, I'm pickin' Biggie's son
He got a pump shot that won't stop when son's hot
He leave his hands in the air
Yo, he the man over there
That's why I'm glad to call him my fam
My granddad passed, though we held hands and cry
Here's a handkerchief for your eyes
He in a better place now Cutty
You was my down buddy
But then I strayed and you went a separate way
And shit started to change
I resorted to sellin' 'yay and you?
Was gettin' A's and OOH
I envy you to this day, you got it made
It's better to say Cutty I admire your ways
And I'm glad
We finally chatted and now, that I'm a daddy
I look at life in a different light
Cause now my dreams my light
And what I write I prolly seen last night
And hey, if shit ain't goin' your way
Give me a page and 9th and Novaj put a sweet deal my way
I said a prayer for the family of mommy and now
We get blessings in the place of our pain
Yeah

[Hook]
Sweetest language
Your kisses, speak in love
The sweetest language that I know
Oh
Your kisses, speak in love
The sweetest language that I know
Oh

You taught me how to speak in love
