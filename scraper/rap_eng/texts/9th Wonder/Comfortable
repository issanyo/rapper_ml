[Hook]
So serious, so comfortable
So silly, at times, she say I'm wonderful
Median, she's chilling with me because I'm comfortable
Doing my own thing, I'm comfortable, man
So serious, so comfortable
So silly, at times, she say I'm wonderful
Won't bring drama to your crib cos I'm comfortable
Doing my own thing, I'm comfortable, man

[Verse 1]
Brand new night, round 8 and iddish
Fresh pressed up in my favourite fitted
I feel so clean and fresh, we [?] the best
Team is so strong, we deem respect
Smirnoff & OJ got me faded
With no [?], and we don't [?]
No way, roll and drove to Marvin Gaye
In a '95 Cutlass, that white thang
Cooler than Spike Lee doing the right thing
Plus pull up to a broad and strike like lightning
With no game, and no dough, and no fame
Control thangs with no foes, the slogan

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a hunger pain
Come fuck with a brotha cos I'm hungry, man
And I means "we", and still, there ain't no "i" in "team", and so I just do me, it's Moody
Motion picture shit, you can make a movie
And camcord my night through the various scenes
We wild out and party but still we gotta eat
So we plot for new ways to turn the pleasure to cream
Shorty creams for the pleasure, this is better than cream
With bad dudes, controlling the tracks, the cat's [?]
My power source is greater, so I can't be moved
Like a vessel on cruise control, watch me move
Watch me move

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm a maintenance man
Politicking with this chick cos I'm a patient man
I listen more than talk these days, and over stand
Everybody need to be felt revealing themselves
It's like 'give & receive' and now she's feeling me
And Median's aroused so I'm digging her now
I was already digging her style, it's physical now
Emotionally involved, she's a prisoner now
Wanting me to jail with her and commit her to me
My eyes become [?], her ties tying me
But that's just not me at the stage of her life
It's paging my life, you really gotta read between the lines
I'm a Birdman Fresh as Mannie, watch me fly
Though the fear's in her smile, and the tears in her eyes
Are eating at my conscience inside, it's so serious
So serious...
