[Sample]
"In a world of our own"

[Verse One]
Look what just stormed up
You just warm up
I stay hotter than all you Gay Fockers
I debate offers from briefcase poppers
Who knew I'm the next shit?
Prune juice I'm the next shit
Up and coming, coming up
A hundred miles and running, what?
You heard that
You backwards, give my words back
Get your own, I hit ya home or close to
I'm more postal
Crazy mad at the price of stamps
The baby dad put the pipe in [?]
Slow quick, the sex healer
Oh shit it's Legzilla

[Hook] {x2}
Wait
Better hold the fuck up, breaks
Better slow the fuck up, spectate
If I show the fuck up, detonate
'Bout to blow the fuck up

[Verse Two]
Hear the tick tick, loud and clearly
Rip shit now they fear me
Like I'm a black planet
I crack granite
Iraq damage
I'm half Spanish
A white lie
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Old table, turning it
No label's permanent
I'm scaring ya name
Press start to pause the game
Leg Hart call on the gang
Went along with it
Nobody wanted my demo, I sent a bomb with it
N.C
Why is the package ticking?
Randy
Why is the Savage tripping?
With his shirt off
Quick to burst off
John Hex's cursed offer or cursed out
The opposite of the worst out

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
True I'm hearing that
I'll pull a disappearing act
He's there then he leaves
Burning a bag of antifreeze
[?]
I arm wrest the Anti-Christ
The making of Over The Top
I'm takin' over ya spot and I spend
The anti-friend
Cause friends are vultures trying to stop my Trendz Of Culture
The crotch ripper
Hate everybody, a Nazi nigga
I'm anti-people and anti-febble
This true shit fed up with this bullshit pressed up
And the radio? So what?
The radio's wack
I hate the radio so much I won't go into Radioshack
With pitiful dumb sounds
And that Same Song
While my Digital Underground flames on
And bangs on
Just hang on

[Hook]
