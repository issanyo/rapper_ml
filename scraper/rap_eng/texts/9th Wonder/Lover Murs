[Verse1:Murs]
She want to make me break down and cry
Her eyes the same colour as the moving sky
I gravitate to her inner sense because we got
That inner sense
When we connect it's intense I have never been
More intimate I miss that passion I miss smashing
Until we sweating I miss all that 4play and all that
Heavy panting I lick you there until you start to pull
My hair to her it's just not fair that we having this affair
And yea I miss holding hands I miss the mouth kissing
Girl I scam I know you like it like that when opposites
Attract I kiss you on the neck while I grind you from the back
Smack you on the ass right when you walk pass
Knowing that later I’m going to make them legs spazz
That ass and caress let’s play house I don’t
I don’t just want to fuck I want to make out
Like Heral Stevens leaving hickey on your neck
That mango moscato got you tipsy got you wet
Next day you want me more than I want you
Is it because I left you hanging like a cable to run through
I let you go first even though I want to cum too
You start to throw it back now I start to run from you
I am saying that I want you but it's more like I need this
Going at it so hard it’s like we making three kids
Cause we know what real love is and profess in public
I’m done with all this tough shit so fuck it I’m love sick
Come on and give me what I got to have
Walking down the street you hold me tight like
Your prada bag show me to your friends
But never let me in to anyone and take me for
Respect because I’m not like other men
Wearing in the basedgod working on that wonder beat
Groupies in my face all day but I don’t want to cheat
Sliding in my Dm’s but you the only one I want to see
All up in your C-Cup I’m in love with what is underneath
Your heart beat is my beat free flow for 48 for bars
And it’s all heat
Cause if the love don’t feel like the sun don’t
Chill then it’s just not real
Real peace

[Hook]
You know it’s real
Oh you know it’s real
Huh look like love is harder
Well so ohh
