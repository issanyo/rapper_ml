[Chorus: Amber Navran]
I pushed aside the truth
'Cause ain't no days are promised
I know I made mistakes
Trying to pray quiet
I gave away my peace
But I know where to find it
I'm going
Going home
I'm going

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
I spent way too much time tryna fit in
"It's time to go"
Laying on this flo' dying flashing thru my life and everybody said it’s cool but Where dey?
"It's time to go"
Telling me we young and that we only gon live once and this the only way to fully enjoy the party
"Damn near all youuuu...home"
But I was having fun before I ever took the risk now they bangin on my chest telling me it’s
"Time to go home"
Thinkin' bout my family, Know this one gon hurt eem honest
Damn I'm sorry mama but I gotta
"It's Time to go home"
Tell grandmama I love her, If you see my baby please hug her
Cuz these demons said I gotta go
"It's time to go"
Save Jordan's for my brother, tell little sister, your daughter, peer pressure is coming
Its real mama
"Damn near all YOUUU"
None of it make it cool
But it's her decision to choose
Just remember me when you it's yo time
"Time to go home"

[Chorus: Amber Navran]
I pushed aside the truth
'Cause ain't no days are promised
I know I made mistakes
Trying to pray quiet
I gave away my peace
But I know where to find it
I'm going
Going home
I'm going

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Brought my baby out to play today
"It's time to go"
Thinking when I saw them arguing I knew that won't it good and so I told her come on baby
"It's time to go"
Now we lying right here dying and it hurts I couldn't save her why they'd have to shoot my baby, God
"Damn near all of youuuuuu"
Over colors she would color wit tomorrow I know they'll all forget about me and her once it's time to
"Time to go hooooome"
Bout her building blocks just yesterday
"Time to go"
So excited to PLAY but now there's blood soaking our clothes and we ain't have nothing do wit it
"Time to go"
Why they have to trip we were enjoying the day but they had to go and ruin shit
"Damn near all YOUUU"
Now we laying on the ground and everything around me fading cuz it's
"Time to go"
I was having fun then mama said its
"Time to go"
Then I heard thang go bang bang- bang bang bang -bang now we lying out here it's time for us
Time to go"
She grabbed me tried run but it was far too late and now we staring at the sun she waiting on me
"Damn near all you"
I hope you don't forget us and that I pray God forgive you when it's your time to go
"Time to go"

[Bridge: Amber Navran]
Sweet sounds of hellos and I'm so undistracted
I remember winds, and long goodbyes and ashes
I will find my strength at last
My mind captive
I'm going
Home

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
We was staring at the sun too
We was shooting at each other now we both dying too
I got a family and I know he got a family too
I'm praying to my God and he praying to his too
He fighting for his family and I'm fighting for mine too
Money, oil, land, gold the only plan was to make it back safe with both my feet and hands but
It's time to go home
Well now I'm on my way back going (it’s time to go)
They'll give my wife a flag and tell my sons how brave their dad was
And when I make it back home (it’s time to go)
I hope they save the letters, pics and now how much I wished
I wish it wasn't time for me to
But know I left wit em on my heart, I ain't want no purple heart
I'm sorry baby but it's time for me (it’s time to go)
