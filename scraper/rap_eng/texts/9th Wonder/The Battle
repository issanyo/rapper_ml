[Sample]
You have lost the battle baby

[Verse 1]
Your story will end before it begins
I throw your demo CD on the floor of my Benz
I got 4 girlfriends, 1 ex and 2 main chicks
Trip cause they all fell in love with the same dick
The same Nick who used to drop bars at lunchtime
Laughed his dumb ass to the bank  with all these punchlines
A frontline pressing out these ho niggas
Throwing up their gang signs and I'm like, "So, nigga?"
A killer who ain't never had a fight in his whole life
You niggas ain't getting at me, or no 9th
Look at me man, I swear I'm back on it
If she bad but her titties sag put some racks on it
Gotta give the game a lift with some gangsta shit
Only backpack nigga used to hang with crips
Few of us made it out making major chips
Now the only time I see them is on the Vegas Strip
Then what we did, got out the hood because we had to
My homie in a three piece suit, he might stab you
I'm tattooed, so the hood forever with me
Niggas talking all that shit, but they never come and get me
I'm blind though, I'm blind though, they talk the talk
But when they come to my city they can't walk where I walk
I'm at King Taco with a fly Ecuadorian
Exquisitely exotic man, I'm so California, damn!
And I miss Sean Price
Body the beat in Brooklyn, put that bitch on ice
Been nasty with these nouns since Nick at night
The homie Pat played the track, now it's Nick on 9th
Government names, we in love with the game
Y'all niggas can't progress, cause you fucking with lames
Homie this mere city, only thing that I bang
From the Legends out to Strange, that ain't never gonna change
I'm dolo, mobbing to the store off in Meddlebrook
Tattoos showing and a nigga better never look
You pay them goons so that you could act hard
I don't need security guard, I got God
No weapon formed against me, I should fear no man
If it ain't the Wu-Tang, I should fear no clan
I rip the white sheet of the redneck Republican
It's Zulu shit, y'all don't wanna fuck with us again
Just play the beat, let the motherfucking record spin
It's Murs and 9th Wonder and we back to fuck it up again
So play the beat, let the motherfucking record spin
It's Murs and 9th Wonder and we back to fuck it up again
