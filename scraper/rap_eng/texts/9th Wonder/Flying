It's me and Mary and Jane and I
9th wonder instrumental got us flying high
Use time creatively writing these lines
We don't even push weight or throw up signs
We just simply push these dope ass rhymes
Then hope one day we all get signed..
Paperchasers stay on my mind &
I be high like pilots tryna land on time
That girl Anika had me on cloud nine
Explaining my love? Try explaining colors to the blind
It all takes time and time is what I need
It's like inception writing out our dreams
Sophisticated hoes, they beg and they plead
So I give her a pillow she won't scuff her knees..
& when it comes to trees I'm fucking mother nature til I get a disease
My future like my teeth brighter than I thought
I'm just fitting through the gaps like flavored dental floss
Mary Jane done got me lost take a pull then I exhaust
Criss cross across hearing loss apple sauce irish moss
Lacross Asher Roth in shorts
Misplace outta space human race knowledge base
Stoner case got me spitting at a thrill ass pace
The purple stuff got me hazel in the face
Ka$h and I start off with a wake and bake
Need some type of inspiration just to get that dirty cake
Sexual intentions with Mary Jane
Lick pull suck the herbs into my brain
The blunt hits so good it takes away the pain
I feel the THC running through my brain.. shit
I'm already lifted.. add a cup of codeine a nigga all gifted
Twisted lifestyle but shit's anew
I'm under the influence but still higher than you
They say it's a gateway drug niggas don't got a clue
It's just a gateway drug to pussy and food
Time to conclude the flight no more weed in the bong
I'm a pothead fuck you imma smoke til I'm gone..

[Bridge]
& the beat goes on and on and on and onnnnnnn
My life seems to go by to fast
But when I'm faded I get to sit back and relax
Bamboo paper and all these trees
My brain is going numb but this is what I need
The week alters a sense of time
Just like my skateboard bitch I'm on my grind
Relax my mind so no more stress for me
The weed indeed is guaranteed what I need..

La la la la la la laa..
