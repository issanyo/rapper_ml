[First Verse]
Back in the day I used to be afraid
Of showing myself in the truest form goin' against the grade
After years of struggle and introspection
I'm a soul warrior living a flawed perfection
Though sometimes I trip and I do make mistakes
I pick myself up regardless what it takes
Even if it's my own life, that's right
In order to grow you gotta make the sacrafice
Of your doubt and fears that be jamming your gears
I'd rather have a good time toast to y'all cheers
But don't forget, while all the glass clank
Life circulates between smelling good and the stank
Look for beauty, be prepared for ugly
I learned this by being seared with scars, trust me
Or not, my inner ship you can never sink
Say what you say sucka I don't give a shit what you think

[Chorus 2x]
It's simple as I don't care what you think
C'mon y'all let me hear it I don't care what you think
Like it or not I'mma be me
You can either roll or go it's really easy

[Second Verse]
Everyone views everything through different eyes
Unique standards your low could be their high
Since no one sees the world through the way you see it
Whatever comment they remark you'd be stupid to believe it
This is me in sushi so raw deal with it
If you feel the positive vibe man chill with it
Bob your head swing your arms rock with it dude
Move and groove to the beat knock with it
Whatever's bothering you flow and find a way to live with it
Cause there ain't nothing greater than the human spirit
I lose no sleep when someone says different
Cause I'm living peaceful when their dead world's belligerent
But I don't ignore them cause the truth remains
Everything has something to teach, try to retain
Only on my own terms do I find myself on the brink
And it's because I don't give a shit what you think

[Chorus]

[Third Verse]
I find it funny when someone doesn't know what you're about
And they already get to thinkin' of you as foul
Those who judge negatively gets filtered out (aight)
Sucks for them cause man are they missing out (right)
As long as you look to others for validation
Your inner castle will crumble cause it's a weak foundation
I'm my own creator, of heaven and hell
We got the choice to make now a paradise or a jail
To no man only the Universe I hail
The truth be you are your own god uh, that's real
If you sick of being of Diablo then whose your Baal?
Who you hang with either helps you rise or fail
Full rejuvenation potion I drink uh
Living to the upmost with every single blink
Long as I live I try to connect the links
Say whatchu say sucka I don't give a shit what you think

[Chorus]
