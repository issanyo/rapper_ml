[Verse One]
Beat acts-acts as a means
Transport
Portate to dreams
All through the-the art of song
We've moved art ways, all along
Music is, it's mad addictive
Truth is I-I have to live with
Music, why-why? That is just it
Choose to cause I've mastered this shit
Lose you quick, quick fast to dissin'
You'll know that-that after this hit
Adapt my thoughts, thoughts to any
Beat that-that you can hand me
Keep that-that used and trendy
Cause we rap-rap good and plenty

[Hook]
Got you switchin' to the beat from front to back
Way beyond belief, make you run this back
Defcon write songs for the love of rap
The addiction comes with 9th Wonder's track

[Verse Two]
I come once-once in a life
So my love is-is thin as ice
Some may say I'm sort of picky
But come one way, for or against me
I'm the type-type to empty
My heart-heart with the pen's ink
See 9th-9th he amazes
With sounds-sounds that's contagious
I write with-with no erasers
Till I like-like what's on the paper
I might-might switch up the cadence
Where some try-try twice to make this
I tried once-once and laced it
I'll strive-strive till my name is
On the list-list of the greatest

[Hook]
