[Verse One: Buckshot]
The mission was supposed to be set off by Tek
Right before the fun was about to begin
B.D. got the call from the wickedest men
Kinda strange cause one of the wickedest was Starang
When I got the call I was waiting in my bed
Took two to the head but didn't feel the effect yeah
Kinda funny cause I just broke myself
Spent my last ten dollars on a dime just to feed my mind
I know it's time
I can feel it in my bones
Ain't no coincidence, son you caught me home
Let's get this paper together
Me and you, you down?
Cause money make this motherfucking world go round

[Hook: Buckshot]
You need a TV?
(Yeah)
You want the PC?
(Yeah)
You want the fly jewelry
(Hell yeah)
Shit, it take money
(Shit take money)

[Starang]
You wanna ride in the low-lows?
(Yeah)
With the GS 3OO's
(Yeah)
Y'all wanna trick on the fly clothes
(Hell yeah)
Well god damn it takes money
(Shit take money money)

[Verse Two: Buckshot]
I got the blueprint, I got the plan
Let me go inside, you wait in the caravan
But get word back from center command
And tell 'em to bring big mama so when shit hit the fan
I can bust back cause I plan to take
Money and make moves, no time to wait
When I get the vision of taking away from stress
Shit without no money? Never I guess
I continue the mission that my man set
(In and out)
Shit son, I got the money, let's jet, no doubt
What you can't make
Create
Some got the plan with the .38, check the murder rate
That's how it's going down
Let's get this paper together
(Why?)
Cause money make this motherfucking world go round

Round and round
Round and round
Round it go

[Verse Three: Starang]
Me and my crew is soldiers
Only getting older, no younger
Sitting in my projects, I watch another summer go by
So high, sometimes I just sit and think
Of how to make your ship sink
(Shit stinks)
I told my nigga Shy when he get home off of Rikkers
We would wil' out just like a bunch of dirty bikers
(And niggas everywhere just like us)
This year is our year
Call my nigga Buckshot and put the bug in his ear

[Hook: Buckshot]
You wanna pay bills?
(Yeah)
You wanna sip wine and chill?
(Yeah)
You wanna eat a four course meal?
(Hell yeah)
Shit, it all take money
(Shit take money)

[Starang]
You want the court sides?
(Yeah)
You want the rims for your phat rides?
(Yeah)
You want the shawty whops to recognize?
(Hell yeah)
Word up, it takes money
(Shit take money, money)

[Verse Four: Buckshot]
I'm already underpaid by my weak ass boss
And on top of that he's trying to lay me off
Last Friday I came into work
The boss looked at me with the face of a jerk
He said, "Buckshot, ain't no need to come to work
Cause I just got word that you did some dirt."
"Oh really? Check my record and see my past
Judging me by my past so I wouldn't last?"
Shit, just because I never listened in class
In high school, I was all about my cash
Now I'm grown up
And my intent is to make power movements
Plus my event is to get the money now
Son, I know how it's going down
Money makes this motherfucking world go round

Round and round
Round and round
Round and round

[Hook]
You want the big link?
(Yeah)
You want to buy my dudes a phat mink?
(Yeah)
You wanna make the bank that stink?
(Hell yeah)
Well it takes money
(Shit takes money money)
You wanna rock ice?
(Yeah)
Niggas wanna live the fast life
(Yeah)
You wanna get the crib without mice
(Hell yeah)
Shit, it all takes money
(Shit takes money money)

Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
