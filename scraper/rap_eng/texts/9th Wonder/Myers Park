[Verse 1]
Sittin' contemplating on ways to get these dollars
Gripping on these pencils, was never known as a scholar
Wanted to pop collars, dippin' in these halls
Wonder if this story ends happily after all
What is yo goals? Yeah, that's what they asking
Wonder if we know, life can be magic
We are the future, find what's gon' suit ya
Or they gonna suit ya, control ya and use ya
Life built 'round school now you know the motion
Find your crew cause they the ones you will roll with
Some people do talk, some do turn to snakes
Watch how people move, know this just in case
Keep yo guard up, in and out hallways
Or it be on sight straight up in broad day
Bunch of young bustas who ain't ready to grow
But we forced to, so you ought to already know

[Hook]
This 'bout my youth, uh
This 'bout my youth, aye
This 'bout my youth, uh
This 'bout my youth, aye
Myers Park, yeah
Myers Park

[Verse 2]
Gather boys and girls let me tell you a story
Wonder if there's gonna be pain or there's glory
Get high or get low, get up or get down
Get out and get something, so things can turn round
Feel like the man now, you got the juice
Man of steel, you is ill, wise guy like Q
But he crazy like Bishop, so he is the hottest news
Cause he crazy he so crazy going crazy in the booth
But, watch the people close to you
Was no one now everybody tryna notice you
It's deep like a submarine, as you can see
You make waves now they wanna see your boat sink
Just think, the world is yours, the world is mine
But it's all about who grabs her first in due time
Enough to go around we all want a piece
But who gon' have the bigger impact 'fore you deceased

[Hook]
This bout my youth, uh
This bout my youth, aye
This bout my youth, uh
This bout my youth, aye
Myers Park, yeah
Myers Park
This bout my youth, uh
This bout my youth, aye
This bout my youth, uh
This bout my youth, aye
Myers Park, yeah
Myers Park
Myers Park, yeah
Myers Park

[Verse 3]
Days 'n nights, I've just been contemplating
Mama knows I've been working that spaceship
Tired, tired, tired, working graveshift
Higher, higher, higher, I'mma take it
Fire, fire, fire, keep on blazing
Fire, fire, fire, keep on blazing
God said that the future is amazin'
Poppa, poppa was a rolling stone
They look at me to go hold the throne
I got to, my flow just
Bloom like lotus
G.O.D my POTUS
I trouble these old men
Man I feel like Otis
Man I feel like Luke
Hood on a hero
Bullet proof in booth
Tryna touch the blacks
Tryna touch the gringos
Trynna touch on facts
Asians, latinos
When the world gon' end?
How the heck should we know
When I use the pen
Give y'all goods like depot
But I'm just tryna go and leave my mark on the earth
Before I'm gone cause I knew that I was target since birth
A target since birth yea a target since birth
Shoutout to my enemies I got y'all coffins in dirt
Shoutout to my enemies I got y'all coffins in dirt
