Let me talk to ya, let me talk to you
I know you kinda busy with your “work” to do
Like . . . pickin' pennies from the pockets of the people
Now your pockets full - you eatin', mock us while you misleadin'
Leadin' us off a cliff, Ms. Eve left Eden
Focus on the preceding while we talk and we proceed;
You focus on desire but you talk about the needs
We have never been free, never been independent
Control the country - you cannot control spending;
Borrow and lendin', look at the place we end in
Elect another term we give ourselves another sentence
Sick and tired of being fed up; get down or get up
Fight back and put our head up and say:

Listen lemme talk, listen lemme talk, listen lemme talk
Politician lemme talk!
Listen lemme talk, listen lemme talk, listen lemme talk
Deacon - Bishop - lemme talk
Listen, lemme talk -
Shut up and let me talk!

Mr. Minister - lemme talk to you:
How come you treat the country like a prostitute?
She had a couple different beauties and she lost a few
Now you slap her in the face, look she lost a tooth
Mr Minister, how 'bout your kids illegitimate?
Humor me a little bit and riddle me this:
Mr. Minister, I know your plan’s all intricate
Judas killed Jesus with the littlest kiss
But this prism is a prison for those who don’t have the vision;
A cage, experience a body-soul fission
Listen, Mr. Politician
Always vacation, out wallet-fishin'
But we ain’t even down for your bull - you could take it
Seen you put on a smile, but we know that you fake it
Mr. Politician, -ician, -ician
Soliciting our coins - got the people well-wishing
You can rob us of our gold
But you can never rob the prism district of its soul
