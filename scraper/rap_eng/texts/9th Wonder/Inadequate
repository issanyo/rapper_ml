(1st Verse)
Spontaneous catastrophes
Youth skipping studio headphones for Beats
The kids got no rules
I think I gotta show the new-school what's cool
Life is so unusual
Before rap was in, I was hooking up Pro Tools
And now it’s sold out
You got a rapper famous for the golds in his mouth
Talking ‘bout molly. Got you rolling it out
Your brain burns down like the gambling house
Wonder why you can’t figure it out
Figure it out
Find it funny
But shit gets real and niggas get bummy
Only thing in this world that's better than money
Is time, and ‘ain't no motherfucker taking it from me

(Hook)
You're inadequate
Everything in this world is inadequate
The Earth when it spins is inadequate
Got you thinking inadequately

The Sun when it shines is inadequate
The clock when it tocks is inadequate
Your mom and your pops are inadequate
Got you thinking inadequately

(Bridge)
Sorry ma’, but the world isn’t perfect
If it was then we wouldn’t have purpose
Right now you're calling me crazy
But me standing here is making you nervous

Sorry ma’, but the world isn’t perfect
If it was then we wouldn’t have purpose
Right now you're calling me crazy
But me standing here is making you

(2nd Verse)
A nigga like me is gonna break you in two
Have your ass running scared like Scooby-Doo
Trying to bite a nigga’s swag like a saber-tooth
Canvas taught you that. Let’s get it clear as Goose
Trade poop for loot
That’s why your dreams heading down a garbage chute
Marvel dude
One problem: They ask, “Who are you?” “Truth is
Extraterrestrial blueprint
Human formed, and sworn to do more
Perception is formed in the core.”
That’s when I resurrected and washed up the shore
Open the doors
Searching for Cinderella washing the floors
One out of a million or more
Microcosmic as I cleanse out her pours

(Hook)
You're inadequate
Everything in this world is inadequate
The Earth when it spins is inadequate
Got you thinking inadequately

The Sun when it shines is inadequate
The clock when it tocks is inadequate
Your mom and your pops are inadequate
Got you thinking inadequately

(2nd Bridge)
Your mind and your soul is inadequate
Your muscle and your bones are inadequate
The bass in this place is inadequate
Symmetry of self is inadequate
The mold of your face is inadequate
Planet Earth's shape is inadequate
This song is inadequate
But the closest thing you'll ever get to perfect, kid!
Perfect
Perfection
