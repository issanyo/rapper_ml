Yeah

Yo, it's October, bars roll together like a squad, mo
Like La Cosa Nostra, rocket launcher on the shoulder
With the Glock holstered, all of them harder than rocks, boulders
Ya'll are softer than a New Kid On The Block poster
Not sober
Ya'll oppose us? ya'll are posers
I'm taking downward dog yoga, so you got jokes, you're not the Joker
Father Mockers roast us, will not acknowledge we're doper
And positive for the culture flock of vultures
Not sober
I'm shocking like dropping the toaster
In the hot water and soap suds while you're washing the bowls up
And the wattage is so tough that you're knocked to the floor busting your noggin wide open, that's kind of gross huh?
Not sober
I'm no Kanye to your Trump
Got the docs to expose ya if fired like Omarosa
No apology, Oprah inspired fiery glow up
Life's a roller-coaster I ride till I throw up
Not so drunk
Hope your listening closer
Like Super Grover, observing these words with calm and composure
I decided for Halloween I would become a troll 'cause
Often we can be so shook
Like "he walked from the faith, cause he made a song where he's boasts!", "What!?"
"I'll be tossing his old stuff"
"Time to alarm my followers", "already put the post up
Topics for hot for the podcast, have you stalked him social
Media, he tweeting stuff he's not suppose to
Not sober
I'ma tell him it's over
I'm not buying his products he lost me when he went over
My head with content that I didn't get cause I'm so young
Theologically I don't wanna grow up
Not sober
I just wanted to know stuff
Brag about what I'm learning and what I will and I won't touch
I would rather explain my way out obeying most stuff
Than be challenged to buck the status quo cause
I'm not sober"
4 more bars for the culture
Make sure all of you critics get context when you quote us
It's satanic attacking the saints and slandering soldiers
Faithfully like New York Cops with the quotas
Not so just
