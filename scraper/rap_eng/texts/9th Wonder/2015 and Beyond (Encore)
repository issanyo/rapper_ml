[Verse]
Beautifully Mind-ed
Spitting bars for the millenium
Charging pennies for thoughts
I'm way harder than pennies [?]
Sticking charges, I bank the shot with seconds on the clock
I'm running out of weapons, I'm left with mace and a Glock
To your face, I'm spraying like cops
I race the human race and [?] take a spot
Chase the boat to the dock
I'm so ready to take vacation
Jamaican's off of the clock
These rappers making scars, I'mma scrape 'em off of the clot
Skill of a wooden sculpter, like taking oak to the blade
Concentrating the focus, I hope your hope didn't fade
While waiting on my project, I've been taking all my time
Trying to perfect learning the process
While making up these rhymes
I learned it only takes a minute
To kill all of your progress
I'm tryna feel like Congress, Obama when I sent it
I hope you payed attention, cause right after you spend it
Credit cars are getting charged
The bars are maxing out your limit
I'm passing out the lemons, their faces getting sour
I mixed a base with a powder, this cake will bake in a minute
Taking all your suggestions, we're meshing them in a session
Like Mexicans driving Vespas, I flex in the intersection
Texting my ex, I told her we can be friends for the moment, Maybe homies
But I know that's gon' change after I bone her
Playing without the bonus, it ain't no extra lives
I recognize if I'mma rise, I need to take my skill and hone it
Pop a pill in the morning, make sure that I'm balanced
They tryna push me off my T
But I make sure there's no malace
The chalice filled with all the nectar
Palace is Taj Mahal
Give me a wife that look like Taraji without the draws
The lab is for the Dexters
You can tell that the man's dark
My brain is skydiving, I hope that I land on a landmark
In 2015, you'll never test a man's heart
I promise I'mma stop playing just as soon as the band starts
