[Chopped samples repeating throughout the song]
The rain - rain - (rain) - on my face
In the rain - rain - to hide my pain - on my..
Hey I like to go out in the rain - rain - (rain)
On my face - in the rain - rain - to hide my pain - on my..
Hey I like to go out in the..

[Verse 1]
See I'm a single black male, dark hair, dark eyes
Long walks through a park and a lot of them lies
I'm a little bit jaded by a lot of what I see
So if you're still interested you should come get at me
Cause I'm tired of getting shot down, put down and dissed
I wanna be picked up, held tight and kissed
But things like these don't happen to dudes like me
Because I'm more Coldplay than I am Ice-T
They say that good girls love bad guys and that might be
But a bad girl with a good guy, that's unlikely
So what's a man to do to get to hold hands with you?
Do I talk shit and stand and look hard with my crew?
I don't know what to do, so I drown in my drink
It helps to numb the pain, cause when I sit and think about it
Eyes get clouded, thoughts get crowded (thoughts get clouded)
So I'mma sit right here, wait for you to talk about it
In the.. c'mon

[Verse 2]
Said she had a boyfriend, just trying to be nice
But I've heard the same lines from different women all night
Too easy let down, but don't let it get you down
Shit, that's what my boys told me, but end of the night
I was still sitting lonely, if only I could find 'em
Without all the drama, without the one-liners
Excuse me miss, hey mam, you got a man, what's ya name?
I'm in my mid-twenties so enough with the games
Simply put I think you're stunning, and what about some kids?
A couple dogs, a couple cars, a four bedroom crib?
Look, I'm not trying to jib, I'm just speaking from the heart
But we can start with a drink if you wanna play it smart
She looking at my boy who got two kids at home and
I know how it goes, here's his number telephone and
He does the girl's turf, and I know you're smelling on him
But every bitch needs a dog, so I guess that's why you want him

[Verse 3]
I try to be subtle, but even flirting got me shooked
I would never get a smile, all I got was dirty looks
And my self-esteem is low enough, I got teased growing up
And what I do, I beat 'em up, but that only made me tough
It didn't get me girls, or notes in class
Same girls who used to tell, when I would pinch their ass
But if another boy did it, then they would get gritty
So I pretended the handball was their face when I hit it
And I admit it's part the reason why I'm do em like I do
And women in my life, there has only been two
My mother being one, and the other one is done
So my philosophy on dating is; ain't no fun
Cause they come and they go, and even if they don't cum
They still have to go, girl I give the best head
But you just wouldn't know, cause you stuck up in some diddy
But even if you dissed me, I ain't mad
Go on do that yo with yo pretty as..
You looked better coming..
No wait, you looked better going than you did coming
Her ass is amazing. High five for Jesus
Keep making 'em like that
Just make 'em with half a brain so maybe they'll talk to me
