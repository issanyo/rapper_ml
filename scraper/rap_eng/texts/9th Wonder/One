[Hook]
Just respect it once you come across a playa hun/
Chicks been foul how im supposed to stay with one/
Been foul how im supposed to stay with one/
Plenty to choose from!(How you want me to stay with one?)
Trust who?(How you want me to stay with one?)
Not you..(How you want me to stay with one?)
Love is out the question, tell me how im supposed to stay with one..

[Verse]
When times right get late calls, man left the cat tight/
Hype soon as it enters, pipe appears like the Dark Knight/
Pools on the sheets, bodies u'll melt/
Fold through the strokes, work this tool under my belt/
Gotta watch who you dealing with, gave up that coochie quick/
Begging for some more, said "Dont play.." when i put the tip/
Want ayythang while you chicken chasing for weddin rangs/
To me that shits insane, we all want the same thing/
Rules ain't never change, line n break like a pool game/
Freak thangs they love that he cold/
Know what I'm bout north or the south insert this pole/
Dont look for me to stay you gon end up sick/
Pissed, catchin fits, rantin bout how men ain't shit/
Frigid shoulders when they're fallin, I could never put my all in/
Miss me with the pouring, tears dry on ya face/
Couldn't replace, satisfy with penetration then we isolate/
Living that wife trife life, I enjoy the shows/
Get ya act together we ain't have a story mode/
Got ya own, shoulda thought before the bone/
Consuming chromosomes, hormones u'll leave ya ass at home alone/
Dug out on the side, it hit the light n then that nigga gone...
