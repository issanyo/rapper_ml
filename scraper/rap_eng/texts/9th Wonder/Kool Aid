[Intro]
What I felt is past tense
What I feel you just haven’t heard
So, I think it’s
Sugar, water, Kool Aid
Sugar, water, Kool Aid

[Verse 1: Add-2]
I think I met you in a past life, right
Lookin’ like my future girl, you that bright, right
You could meet my moms if you act right
I ain’t your first, maybe I could be your last right? Right
See your perfect imperfections is what makes you fly
I know that you ain’t got it all lady, neither do I
It’s cause we human, and that’s what bein’ human’s about
Them girls are chasin’ men with figures they ain’t figured it out
That it’s a love thing, girl you like the black Mona Lisa
Love your apple bum, are you the daughter to Bonita?
Hello, how ya doin’ girl? It’s really nice to meet ya
You the perfect song, I’m just tryna be the feature
Plus you look good and you cook good
So I’m tryna steal your heart like a crook would
I ain’t tryna sound thirsty, all I need you to do is
Pour me a little you

[Hook: Add-2]
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid

[Verse 2: Add-2]
Late night, lights out, chillin’ watchin’ Netflix
She ain’t never ask ‘bout any of my exes
(I know) that she different (I know) girls be trippin’
I mean even Uncle Phil had to change Aunt Vivian
We so close but we just friends
She say “I’m like Dre”, I say “she likes Sid”
If it’s cool with you then it’s cool with me
But your name and mine sound good to me
I love every scar on you, stretch marks on you
Takin’ off your clothes kissin’ every flaw on you
God damn you was fine, you had a man at the time
See I’m tryna make you mine like there’s a diamond to find
Tryin’ not to cross the line, love’s runnin’ through my mind
Why God always send the right one at the wrong time?
Watch the one you love go and love somebody else
Know she feel the same even if she never tell

[Hook: Add-2]
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Stay for a while baby, please don’t leave
Got a couple questions, need your expertise
What you think about friends like Derane and Denise
Like he loved her, could you love me?
Could I be your favorite flavor like Queen Latif’?
I’m tired of living single, want some unity
And you the only one that could fulfill these dreams
Like I loved you, could you love me?
I had a thought about you last night
I see us havin’ a lifetime bein’ your last wife
Til death do us part
By your side when given last rights
If I had a song to sing to you it would be “Prototype”
Cause you the prototype
Soul mates like we had the same matching Jordan Nikes
All footwear don’t matter, wear whatever you like
It all look good on you, walking into my life
The sweetest thing I ever known, all sugar no spice

[Hook: Add-2]
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid
You’re my (sugar), you’re my (water)
You’re my Kool Aid, you’re my Kool Aid
