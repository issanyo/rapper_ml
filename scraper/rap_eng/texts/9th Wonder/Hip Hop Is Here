[Verse]

I do this for the realest, bright lights [?]
Those who really know what my life's like [?] assurance
Hoes who get hype off the ice [?] appearance
The [?] who got sniped lost the fight right where the cure was
[?] made you niggas frontin', today my niggas huntin'
[?] guaranteed the fetus, babies in the stomach
The government's got us lost, won't reveal the shooter
[?] Behold a Pale Horse [?] William Cooper
The government's got us lost, won't reveal the shooter
[?] Behold a Pale Horse [?] William Cooper
The OG [?] in and out
Alphabet's locked in a pen, know what this pen about
I'm lounging for now like I sit on your mom's rented couch
Dress you up nice, let me bring these lyrical linens out
I'm that dude when I pen a feelin'
I write drugs on the roof of my room, I call that penicillin
Niggas like "How could he say that?!"
My birthday ain't a month before June, but need that Maybach
[?] a simple price to pay though
Flow born in water [?] ice and Yayo
And towards that, but should I charge four stacks
[?] on em', that Grand Concourse rap
I hustle sour and purp for a purpose
Not on purpose, no one's perfect
I'm tryna feed my kids, put bread in my wife's purses
You put it all together, ten [?] nine purchased
The last one is on the rate you pay
Cause' Hell's hot, the mailbox, [?] sells pot, no Rachael Ray
And I'm careful, I watch moves
Hometown, Bloomberg gone now, he's [?]
Dude, I'm just tryna speed up my slow dough
Neighbors get jealous, they wanna bring up the photo
I'm livin' in the game where the promises is a no-no'
And dealin' with the pain that Obama is just a logo
You don't believe us? When Papa John call
Them Dominoes fall and coming for a pizza at Caesar
So I know they coming for this head, pause
Got that [?] flow, no South Pole or bear paws
I rock Pumas, stocks flock to us
Jewelry so cold even the watch got boogers
Think I'm the mane selling 'cain to the pushes?
I'm grinding behind the fame just to blame it on the Bushes
There's pain through these woofers, I rain on you suckers
Aw man, this armband got clusters
My heart's bland, got dark plans for busters
I charge man a large hand of mustard
Bronx, we all in, you think I got a sick army?
I'm calling Mitt Romney, more men
The raw pen, saying lines more than one time?
You dumb fuck, look it up, find the punchline
You see I'm way authentic, fake G's
Plainly thank me, ain't [?], just the way I pen it
Reef Hustle back to business on the average
Y'all playin', I'm displayin' my sermon to the parish
[?] through the ghettos of America, they snortin'
My son want [?] right now? Not important
But what I call it ain't "The Land of The Poorest"
But instead "With no bread you end up dead in a forest"
Why should I give a fuck about his feelings?
I need to make a million on [?] and Hank Williams
We aware, watch your kid drop tears
Let these motherfuckers know that Hip Hop's here
We aware, watch your kid drop tears
Let these motherfuckers know that Hip Hop's here
