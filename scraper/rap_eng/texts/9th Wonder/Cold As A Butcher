[Intro]
You don't wanna see us. Come on man we cold. You're not seeing us at all man. No competition. Kobe and Shaq of this. Before he assaulted the chick

[Verse One]
Deep under my chest, hard beats under my flesh
The light bitch is real
And I do assume
"That Nigga Was Ill" will be etched on my tombstone
Like the Pied Piper
Forever like Gobstoppers
I mark creases
Rhyme pages of the Bible
I'm not Jesus but they wait on my arrival
But first
When and where, speculating
At birth, smack the nurse's ass when she came in
Alias George cause the hoes get Curious
They call me more
I'm so serious
I pray to change me
I'm swift to ride off
Made the day angry
And pissed the night off
Swift like dragonflys
My dick and apple pies
I mask my eyes
I slashed you die
Oh, when I push you, I slash you for sport
Cold as the Butcher in Gangs Of New York

[Hook] {x4}
Cold as the Butcher in Gangs Of New York

[Verse Two]
God, they wanted to touch my shit since I been born
The show flower
Play on my dick in a winter storm and call her a "snow blower"
(Call her a snow blower)
Off the hook
I get blown away
I'm off the hook
I rip the phone away
Out the wall
[?] I mash you all
[?] I dust you off
The ear of Van Gogh
I cut you off
Then send it to wifey, my friends do you like me?
Do you hate me?
I hate you
You're crazy I pay dues
Put in work, had chores
Been around a rap whore
You heard I'm high price
You've heard that life's ice but I'm bearable
I like striking
The fucking one
Terrible like Ivan
You're not licensed
Please wait it's hopeless
Just stop writing
This is the cold shit

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
What better than ever
Then I rhyme stable
Fucking Thelma Evans on a Good Times table
Multiplications
See the Rick Rude Awakening
Now I'm here
I spat the meanest
Society's fear
I'm a black genius
Give a shit who you are
Live on you settle faggots
Get hit with bars like Piles on Full Metal Jacket
I will charge ya
Leaving grown men on milk cartons
They not to be found
The bush, not the beat around, no play
Man I'm cold as Yoplait
The rock star
When I said it, pure cold
Find you where you are like the credit bureau
I want you to know man
Abominable Flowman
Spoke a cold threat
Woke up in a cold sweat, drama, the whole shit
Nightmare, more hurting, finger roll chicks
Ice Man, George Gervin

[Hook]
