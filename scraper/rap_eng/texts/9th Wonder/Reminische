(Verse 1, Big Remo)
I remember it like a dream
It was all clean, rings, accessories
And we ain't puff cabbage we puffed that sensemi
Especially, when we been grindin' like two days
Go in the house and switch hats like a toupee
We brown baggin' a back mattress
We dressed like we ain't never had shit on the air
And clock a grip for it
And spendin too much cheese
And snortin with skeezers I fell with a nigga
I helped him and he helped me
And i would ride with him
We could of died pullin jobs tryna rob niggas
And then you had a seed unfortunately
But very fortunate for you cause dude
I don't know what the fuck you be goin through
My nigga, you was my best friend
A bitch would never come between us
Remember that shit
Rims and tires, and backflips in the back of the path
We stacked chips, tell them D's cats this
Then back to the dutchmaster
Twist it crack a liquor for em
My niggas get a cup fill it up
This is for my slain and missing ones
If you ever had a love found slain or missing
Although you may have parted ways
This is how we reminisce
Hey!

(Chorus, Novej)
No lie, really how could i forget you
Sometimes, I wish that i could kick it with you
More now, than ever
I wonder do you take time to reminisce
I reminisce

No lie, really how could i forget you
Sometimes, I wish that I could kick it with you
More now, than ever
I wonder do you take time to reminisce
To Reminisce

(Verse 2, Novej)
This is dedicated, yep to everyone that should of made it
Make it, be reeducated never say that
It's too late it's the perfect timing
Opportunity met by preparation is modern dated
I feel obligated, to stand tall
You recall, when we got raided
Remember the way we ball
They penalized our team
Who were we playin' for, the cars?
Oh, I'm, just, reminiscing
With that in mind we could have a sit down
Where we used to, drinkin on deuce-dueces
The corner store made a little change off them looses
Furthermore, what was on my chain cost a few chips
And Ms. You Know Who was like a mother to the whole crew
Hi Ma, ya boy's gone global
After at Noble View, old school
I paid homage it's an honor
I know, I never told you
I reminisce

Chorus

(Verse 3, Big Remo, Novej)
(Big Remo)
Now you in Cali, I can't ride with a nigga
When shit gettin bout it, Lil Malik gotta meet Lil E
They gotta chill, we gotta build
I tell you bout this life that I live
Cause shit is real for a nigga now
I met this nigga 9th Wonder he gettin a nigga out there
He ain't no joke, I ain't a hoe, yo why'd I I tame the flow
I'm more reserved, but I still keep it gangsta though, yeah
(Novej)
Today is another day, another time at another place
Another individual, finds another way
And refuse to catch another case
About food you too? I want another plate
For one anothers sake, let's not forget
Where we come from, what's done is done, let's elevate
Yeah I remember what they used to say
But let's create a bond much stronger bend but never break

(Chorus)

(Outro)
