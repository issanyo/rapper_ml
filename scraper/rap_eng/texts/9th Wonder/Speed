[Intro: Phonte]
This life have a nigga hustling man
Niggas need to slow it down yo
Sit back just chill just relax
Speeding down the roads of life
Yo check it

[Verse 1: Phonte]
Another day to face, I'm share cropping in the paper chase
Take a deep breath and clear my database
It's afternoon I'm talking shit to my alarm clock
Cause I gotta face this world of capitalistic onslaught
Don't stop when I jump in the whip, trying to get it off
Beltline got me rushing like Baryshnikov
Pushing 80 miles per hour to this, call center
Trying to pick up a check I only see 20 percent of
Until the weekend, it sound crazy when I'm saying it
But sleepless nights got me forgetting what day it is
Until my son two days with out speaking, looking for
Reasons to keep my head from going off the deep end
I take this shit personally, I'm making moves
But this treadmill lifestyle ain't working for me
It's from your crib to the lab to your job to make a profit
And at the days end you still got nothing accomplished
And it's just the way it's going down, but on the real, yo
I think I need to slow it down, and slow it down

[Hook]
This joint is going too fast for me
Just too fast for me
Just too fast for me
Just too fast for me
This really moving too fast for me
Just too fast for me and you

[Verse 2: Big Pooh & Phonte]

[Big Pooh]
I try to slow it down like Brand Nubian
But hypnotic tunes like this always do me in
Got a nigga about to go and burn the road again
From first gear to fifth gear out of control again

[Phonte]
And that's the way we rolling in, needed to chill
And take a rest stop cause my job got me slaving like I'm Dred Scott
Take a break nah nigga you betta not, cause that's when the respect stops
Energy drain, I need a blast like Hi-Tek got
So I can grab the mic and make your heads bop
With the microphone check, one two it don't stop
Out of town on a quick escape
Hoping to have a chance to slow it up and hit the brakes
And slow it down

[Hook]
This joint is going too fast for me
Just too fast for me
Just too fast for me
Just too fast for me
This really moving too fast for me
Just too fast for me and you

[Verse 3: Big Pooh & Phonte]

[Big Pooh]
I let my life shine in between these papers lines
I write rhymes to incite minds
Spending time on this pipeline, eighty-five
North it's like mine, going eighty five to light minds
Going ninety five to take time
Spending days in the rays of the sunshine
Many days those same rays went undefined
Now forty east is where I go to have my best times
Three lanes going sixty to perfect rhymes
Tre dose and master craft catch punch lines
We turning into early morning late night times
Amtrak Monday morning to come back rides
Catch a couch on the weekend, a place I rarely did sleep in
Te car speaker knobs is tweaking
Cause the way we be rocking it when joints is finished
At the speed we be moving we could never be diminished

[Phonte]
With my energy replenished write a rhyme with puns and
All my similes intended speed out until I finish
Keep it on now
We keep it, and keep it, and keep it on now
And keep it, and keep it, we keep it on now
We run it, we do it, we keep it on now
We do it, we did it, we keep it on now
We don't stop

[Hook x2]
This joint is going too fast for me
Just too fast for me
Just too fast for me
Just too fast for me
This really moving too fast for me
Just too fast for me and you
This joint is going too fast for me
Just too fast for me
Just too fast for me
Just too fast for me
This really moving too fast for me
Just too fast for me and you
