My purpose is to wreck the nervous and worthless with verses
I write in cursive and spit to take them straight beneath the surface
Like the Genius, see this, rhyme will leave you speechless
And cause an inconvenience, see, what I mean is
I've been sick with the wordplay since I was born on a Thursday
The kind that leaves emcees shaking like earthquakes
When I combine this with the pen, emcees meet their end
When they contend, they get condemned, they can't defend
Themselves from the eloquence I spit with such excellence
Combined with the intelligence that's rare in a world of decadence
Where everyone is corrupt within
Committing the deadliest sin without knowing it'll affect their kin
Lyrical messiah with the hellish fire
Emcees should retire, they're no longer admired
Matter fact, they're forgotten, their flow's rotten
Soft as cotton, this flow has gotten
Tighter, the flow gets brighter like a lighter
Ya'll ain't writers, ya'll biters, I'm the top rhymer
Flow refiner with rhymes finer than China
Got words that'll hit you like a sixty-niner
Caliber, challengers witnessing the massacre
From my vernacular that crushes the cardiovascular
Like cardiac arrest, hit your chest with the zest
Of my lyrical progress, teach you not to test
Like exams, MCs cram cause they can't understand
That I rock the flow from Wilson to Durham
From Charlotte to Greenville, from Cary to New Bern
I rep the 252, emcees better learn
