[Verse 1]
Ironic that the pain seems to reach me everyday
And the beauty of the rain is the one that got away
So now I need condolences
And maybe if you noticed this
It wouldn't be the habit that I tend to sink into abyss
And start to fucking reminisce on days I used to swing and miss
So really how you gon' try and lecture me now?
When the days that I've lost are the voices I've found
And the voices in my head seem to hate where I'm bound
But if I'm aiming for the crown then I have to fight rounds
And if I keep making songs I'll fall in love with my sound
So who you give a fuck about?
When all these songs I'm putting out
Maybe in this drought I should've picked a different route
Cause this the type of music Charlemagne won't play
But fuck it cause God ain't ever talk to me anyway
You think I give a fuck now?
Asking what is up now?
Funny how they celebrate but never asked me how
How I made it through the pain
And how I went against the grain
And I still feel suicidal even in this lane
Cause these days I fade away but these thoughts they're here to stay
The thing I need now is a straight blade razor
I'll slit my wrist aesthetically and be my own savior
So really man please stop asking me for favors
Cause the pressure's building up and it's changing my behavior
Cause ever since you left I can't trust anymore
And the bourbon in my system has me like a liquor store
I've been running so long that my legs became sore
These thoughts in my mind like "will I make it to sophomore?"
Cause recently it seems like I ain't really too sure
Depression and I, man we find ourselves in nihilism
The rain in this life, seems to blurry up the vision
