[Verse: Tiger Fang]

(Starting to worry about)
Reaching times when my pockets go dry
And I can't find a dime to buy some lye that I can go and grind
Can't find, (who?), myself, that's who
See I've been lost up in the haze in my brain since June
2011, I swear I was in heaven for my teen years
Hit 20 years, and found out that I got so many fears
Terrified to fail or disapoint myself
I'm scared of not being able to pay for pop's bad health
Scared that I may melt, in a flame called hell
Cause I've been out of touch with God since 9 dash 12
9th Grade fights with white kids who called mom a terrorist
Now I'm rolling with the crooked kids who be the scariest
At Maple Hill Park, you'd see us when it's dark
We'd toke in the moonlight until those cop cars parked
They told me life don't get better if you blaze
I agree, but I still stayed the same, I don't change, God damn

Fuck it, ain't no way that I'mma love it
As I grow up I can feel them all just flying in my stomach
Mistakes, please help me to correct
Small steps, Witness, the Butterfly Effect

(Bitches ask)
Is he sad or is he sad for attention?
These fucking questions that all these hating bitches mention
I'm out the box, bitch you in, you got a life sentence
Write sentences on my mind's paper to kill tension
I mentioned my past. Those dreams that I had
If you don't dig em then ya'll say that my last album was whack
And they see that I ain't black, so they ask why do I rap
I respond and hit 'em back, and tell 'em that "well matter fact,"
See I don't really give a fuck, and I don't really give a damn
Enemies be acting tough and don't know who the fuck I am
I am me, I am me, and I swear I'll never be
Somebody with a brain different than what I got in my vicinity
You into me or not? Cause I swear you people stocked
With emotion, to the brim, past the point, that top you off
(With emotion, to the brim, past the point, that top you off.)
