[Quartermaine]
Spokesman of the precious few
I represent the views of independent youth
That wrestle nail and tooth to evade neckties and suits
Cause truthfully a nine-to-nine's a waste of time
Plus a waste of mind, so I blaze a dime
Tryna find creative ways to escape the grind
I gotta take what's mine in this land of milk and honey
Filled with money, still hungry and won't finish
Till I fill my tummy, grill me or love me
My passion is unbridled, when idol crafted recitals
They can't lose like Magic or Michael, pick or choose
Not only dropping knowledge but slamming and dishing jewels
Navigate with slicker moves, through the gritty city I cruise
Confused what to do with my life, but got my sights set on the apex
It's a safe bet that I ain't taking no for an answer
This quest for dough is like a cancer
Spreading over body parts, especially my mind and heart
Time to start the relentless pursuit so I can make my mark
On this planet, granted I meant it, see-saw mechanics
From circumstances that only causing confidence damage
Planet firmly I'm standing on the outskirts of the average
Relishing the challenger till the day my spirit vanish
Man this life is tough and I've had enough, my tank's on empty
Valleys are plenty, but from the top they can't prevent me
The rotten apple, it tempts me, locked in the grapple at Lensy
Time to take stock and watch how far determined they should get me

[Hook: Phonte]
Everybody across the world better get your hustle on
Out in the street, move your feet before your money's gone
Mama can't sleep and baby need clothes
I gotta make my moves so I got some
Mama can't sleep and baby need clothes
I gotta make my moves so I got some
Yeah, yeah

[C.A.L.I.B.E.R.]
Stress should hear me, never any rest for the weary
Try to progress, at best I eat, sleep barely
The future is scary and so I proceed to look for solid ground
But difficult because I'm always in and out of town
Weigh by the pound, not in a duffle
I bear a bigger burden on my back that go beyond the strength of muscle
The hustle and bustle, trying to figure out the puzzle
Of how to triumph amongst the troubles sent to bust your bubble
Trust I'm accustomed with the everyday
I wonder will my stress will ever decay, looking for a better way
Ahead of the days of a bigger mission, sealing my vision
C.A.L.I.B.E.R. living and bringing it to fruition
Lord if you listen, I'm only asking for the strength
To bask in the paper after laboring for such length
It's like an eternity with much ahead
I hope of every second I invested, I'm collecting at the end

We gotta hustle y'all, right now y'all
