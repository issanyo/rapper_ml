[Verse One: J Gunn]
Told y'all I was fuckin' these beats
Man, you hear the track moaning like it's cummin' dawg?
That's coming from me
It's nothin' but heat
The Thyrd, 9th Wonder's the beat
You can't be still like the ground movin' under your feet
Runnin' from me
Who said you can't move to real hip hop?
Groove, it's true music, make them hips hop
Stop, I apologize to other artists out there
Cause we got all the dope shit and it don't seem fair
Got my whole team here, where y'all at (Right here!)
Every year? (Aww yeah!)
U.N.N. (Not here!)

[K-Slack]
You best fear, cause we don't have nothin' to lose
Just like security you better (move, move!)
Out my way cause I could San Diego charge ya
Like Junior Seau my whole squad is wild
But the thing is
You don't wanna fuck with us
So don't even make a bet, in God we trust money

[Hook: J Gunn] {X2}
Rock to it
This is music for my peoples, ladies drop to it
If you with me let me hear you, don't stop, do it
Love makes good music feel good don't it?
Feel good don't it?

"While we rockin' it, I'll rock in it" - De La Soul 'Oooh'

[Verse Two:J Gunn]
Hip hop music
Jimmy Hendrix, Kid Rock music
I heard your album, I'm sorry, it's not music
Yada, yada, yada, you got ice you got hoes
And you nice with the flow
You can rhyme, it's your time, you gon' blow, no
This is not for you
It's for my peoples who love the music man, I love you

[K-Slack]
With so much passion, all I need is a pen and a mic
Fuck this beat, even my accapella still be tight
Like a virgin, screamin' at the top of her lung

[J Gunn]
It's 3D
Cats was lackin' Joshua Gunn
We polish, refine
The track will snap you outta your mind
One of a kind
Yo 9th I think we got it this time

[K-Slack]
And that's fo' so'?

[J Gunn]
Hit the flo'

[K-Slack]
Grab a girl

[J Gunn]
Or pick a ho

[K-Slack]
Who is that?

[J Gunn]
With the flow

[Both]
3D

[J Gunn]
Niggas know

[K-Slack]
Get live

[J Gunn]
Favorite song if you breathin' at all

[K-Slack]
Cause 3D is in the house we came to rock for y'all
