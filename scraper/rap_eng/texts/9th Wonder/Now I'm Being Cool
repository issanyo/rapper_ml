[Verse 1: Mela Machinko]
Boy, you got me knocked out, laid up, love sick over your love
You got me wondering what the hell I was thinking of
When I was pushing you away with my silly games
And all the while you were trying to say I should have some faith
And now boy, boy, boy
You got me calling your name
You got me screaming your name, I'm like boy

[Refrain]
Oh boy, love is what you gave me
Oh boy, why can't you forgive me
I've changed, you'll see it's true
I'm sorry, now I'm being cool

[Verse 2: Mela Machinko]
Boy, I got you messed up, from these lame ducks
And still I couldn't see how let a good man locked down
You are a blessing, you are the best thing to come to my life
And it's a shame that it took me so long to realize
I couldn't put my trust in you cause I was afraid
And now I'm begging and I'm praying it's not too late
I'm like boy, boy, boy
You got me calling your name
You got me screaming your name, I'm like boy

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Median]
So cool lady boo, you are too crazy
Peep the new you, what you been doing lately
Me, I've been maintaining, doing my thing
Though the sun shines but now you had me dancing in the rain
With me being confused with all your dubious ways
Or was it jealously that fueled your dubious games
My first thought, she's too cute, I stuck around a played
Fast forward, she's a cuckoo, I had to step away
And regroup the pieces of my sacrifices, changes
Cause you can't change a person, they have to see the game
And you just couldn't see it, blinded by my freedom
Girlfriends in your earpiece saying you shouldn't be with him
Had you think-thinking I was cheating, following the lead of their misery
You should have been the leader
And held me down like 9th on the wheels of the True School
Lady we are too through, now you're being cuckoo

[Refrain]
