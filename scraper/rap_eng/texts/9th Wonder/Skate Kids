[Produced By: 9th Wonder]

[Verse 1: Sundown]
We come cruising down the block, stop
Beastie boy in the drop so drop the top
Kill yourself when the suicide doors open
Gather round for the show, bitches close in
Slit my wrist in the parking lot, let it clot
Never stop so get used to seeing Sundown
Pound the pavement, concrete chips in my fist
Eat a dick, gourmet chef appraise shit
Sharp wit, ice pick
I'm fatally attracted to the snare and the kick so let's dip bitch
I'm on the friends and the fridge too cold on 'em
Chilly illy get a mitt and get ahold on 'em
Cause he's outta here, sky's lookin' clear
Near vision in my prism, let's get 'em Ninth -- let's get 'em Ninth
Near vision in my prism, let's get 'em Ninth
Kickflippin' on my skateboard gettin' right
On deck like Tony with the tape tight
Lace the Vans up, pull my pants up
And ease down the boulevard, still lookin' hard
Ya squint your iris on set when I arrive
And they Ray-Ban shades never fade a shiny stellar image
They want a piece of me, fine, I give it to 'em
Bright lady beats and me focus when I'm picking through them
9th Wonder put the game in a slumber
Just when ya lumber like [?] it's our summer
Fucking [?] I'm jumpin' through a loop hole
Truth be told, I'm on a whole different train of thought
Trained to talk like I'm educated, predicated
[?] that the nerds can't rap watch me elevate it

[Verse 2: Enigma]
Slow, hold up, old school gangsta shit
Money folded up, jet black, the window tint
Twelve pack back in the trunk, [?] them 808s
Back seat packing the blunt, the smoke levitates
No, I don't peddle weight, never [?]
At times rhyme with devil traits
Beaming high pierce through the fog
I'm no celtic mane and won't settle for any level no less than great
Yes I elevate
That gold medal weigh, that Mike Phelps might [?] gettin' hella play
So stay the hell away
Mike [?] parlay I'm out with Cosby and babes having jello dates
Babes on rollar skates
Mate like [?]
Ray-Ban the brand of shades
You could tell I'm older right? They like older guys
