[Verse 1: Heather Victoria]
Once upon a time, you were all I needed
I was super high, you just bluntin’ and the treein’
It happened all too fast, fast, I was so naïve
And after a while I started to see more clearly
That you were just a pup, sniffing around and wheezing
Roaming around at night, I wasn’t all you needed
You disrespected me, me, repeatedly
And baby after a while I left all that behind

[Hook]
No, no, no, no
I’m not taking you back now
I’m not taking you back now
I’m not taking you, I’m not taking you back now
Now
I’m not taking you

[Verse 2: Heather Victoria]
Here you go again blowin’ up my phone
I remember when you left me all alone
You didn’t care then so why should I care now?
Somehow baby, I don’t care at all
Here we go again, same old conversation
Funny, you appear when I got new relations
Who’d have thought that day that I would be over you
Still confused on what you wanna do

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
What we talkin’ bout, getting together?
Only one more chance, you gettin’ [vouletta?]
Son, Big not Pun, or Big L you take Miami
You take Florida like [?] flow
Dam dam dam, [James?] feel you
I’m mentally not the same at all in a full page letter
Checked out like [knickers?] do, pretty Corettas
Open arms I bear these days I’m [?]
[?] don’t give the same shots I used to then
Mills get seconds, men depend on them
These days your chances, yo they lookin’quite slim
112, cupid, nowhere he [?] this hell
Better friends we’d be so lets just be that
Cause to keep it one hundred ain’t no takin’ you back
Love cost a lot and you ain’t worth that much
So two fingers I leave you with friendship bruh

[Hook]
