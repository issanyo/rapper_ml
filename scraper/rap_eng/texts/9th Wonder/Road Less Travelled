[Chorus: Sinead Haze]

I will never fatigue
The road less travelled's for me
Worked too hard to succeed
Now it's my time to lead

[Verse 1: Podge Dwyer]

Introducing, It's the never seen before
Never have I seen the floor,Call me "conkeisterdor"
Getting that ass, Empty pocket syndrome, Tryna get to the cash
Get the cake, Get the cream, Get spondulix
Never catch me with a wife-beater, I am not Karreuche
I am not a groupie
I am not a floozy, I am fucking genuine
Never rocking Fucci
Belushi, With the fucking punchlines
Forever being unkind, That's why I'm unsigned
Uh, I don't conform to their ways
I got alotta shit to say, But you're performance was meh!
That means it was nothing special, Got zettels and a vessel
With the skill of Barney Kessel, Won't settle
Til I'm known as the best
Shout out to Lord Jamar, But I'm not only a guest

[Chorus]

[verse 2: Podge Dwyer]

And I've been in love with Hip-Hop, Since Ben was a wristwatch
And when I go Platinum, Herc will get a fraction son
And that's a promise I'll keep
Staying true to the roots as I nod to Tariq
You got the Joshua Tree, I got Rakim & Eric B
I followed the lead to what I want to achieve
And that's greatness, Now I'm the best MC
I effortlessly, Move the crowd like Cesare
But no Roman ruler, Borgia impurer
Staying true to the roots as the flow maneuvers
I'm a supersonic, Celtic, bringing heat, Like Jesus Shuttlesworth
Hydroponic haze, that helps you ease the pain, I'm Buttersworth
An artist that gets you high, A baller exemplifying
Everything you need to be a beast and to perfect the style
Accessorize, very little, If I die I'll be the Divil
Rise again and fight again, Fuck you you're not on my level

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Podge Dwyer]

You thought I was done, But here comes another round
Dealt with the ups and downs, Now I'm here to shut em' down
Apocalypse, when I strike back
Represent my own slang, But these dudes are type whack
Ryback, Yeah they're yesterday's news
Only good for showing off, Like a vestibule
With a chandelier and portrait, Best for you to forfeit
Your dreams are just a fantasy, Like Vandermeer had wrote it
But that's enough of the battle rhymes
This is for the people persevering through the badder times
Wake up everyday, And havta listen to the Shatter lies
Let's fraternise and disinfect the system like formaldehyde
Mastermind our own future, Play no games with those losers
Rise again and fight again, Like Abidal with old tumors
Super, To have you on this journey with me
On the less travelled road where the destination's victory, Ya with me?

[Chorus x2]
