[Sample]
Girl I'm gone...out of your life
Baby, I'm leaving this time

[Verse One: J Gunn]
I never forget my real life
Even if I make it in this biz
I'll remember to be thankful for everything I get
Every single screaming kid who caught one of my punchlines
All the kids who told me I was the best they heard, unsigned
One time, I remember rockin' a show
And watchin' jaws drop when I said I was nine years old
As time moves slow I remember good times first
Like Easter mornings in a suit lookin' good 'round church
For every problem that I have, I've got a wonderful life
I'll never forget the day I met the love of my life
Clutchin' these mics, reflect on life's previous cause
I catch tears in my eyes from the memories lost

[Verse Two: K-Slack]
I'll never understand why my mother turned her back on me
Or my dad's homicide, man that shit haunts me
I feel crazy, the bullet keeps on piercing my brain
So I try to cope with life and adapt to change
But it's hard, but ain't nobody holdin' me back
So I put my faith in God so my brain can relax

[Hook: J Gunn]
I will never forget all the things I've seen
As long as I'm alive, I'll be sure to recall
What it took for me to rise, so I do not fall
I will never forget what I put in this dream
Where I'm from, where I'm goin'
Hot or as cold as the winter weather
A loser or a winner I will always remember

[Verse Two: Killer K]
Ayo J, remember kindergarten?
Remember writin' our first rhyme?
Remember gettin' me started?
Remember southern crew?
Remember HB?
I remember waitin' patiently for our date to see
(A record deal?)
Basically
How could I forget my boys who held it down?
Or got me to my feet whenever I fell down
And to my girls y'all my heart
Y'all been with me from the start
If ever we start, your memory will remain within my thoughts
And if our paths cross, it's hats off
I remember gettin' in fights and scuffing my shoes
Remember smokin' trees cause I had nothin' to do
And I won't forget my boys cause I don't have a choice
I love my crew

[J Gunn]
Motherfuck those who
Had too much to say
Runnin' around the Bull City like I don't fuck with J
You said I won't make it
Boy was you wrong
Remember when I told you that battle boy could do songs
I'd never forget the way y'all used to look at me wrong
The way you trashed my tapes and said I couldn't get on
Now your tune switched
Tellin' me to remember you
When I drop my first hit
I'll be sure to forget

[Hook]

[Verse Three: K-Slack]
So many memories from Stephanie, I'll never forget
Plus my [?] clique was always down for some shit
Y'all know the deal, everybody in the CBT
NYC, Alaska, that's where I got family
Don't look surprised, I still rep the Bull City
Like my cousin Mike Nice and my other cousin Scotty
It's just a hobby how my pen flows, smooth
Just like this girl I bumped into, in G-Borough
So many things I can't forget
J Gunn and Killer K, yo, I'm glad we made it
We used to argue and fight
Write raps every night
But I wouldn't change it for nothin' cause that's my life

[Killer K]
I wish I could forget, my horrible wreck
My brush with death when I wrecked the Corvette
I wish I could forget when my father died, like it didn't happen
But I would never have been rappin'
Wish I could forget Bin Laden and 9/11
But these memories will stay with me until I lie in Heaven

[Hook]
