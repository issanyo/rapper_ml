[Verse 1]
Okay, I'm ready, keep the beat steady
Flow so sharp, I'll cut you into confetti
With claws like Freddy, Krueger
I spit flames like Koopa
With the words like bullets of a Luger
Leave rapper's bodily matters splattered, spattered, and scattered
Cause I'm madder than a hatter ready to cause a disaster
On stage, see, this is real hip hop
Not that fake trip-hop where you flaunt your wristwatch
And your gold chains, got me so angry that I'm showing veins
Like leg pains, they think it's like arcade games
Call me the Final Boss, cause you've already lost
Cause your flow's too soft, I'm the new age like Microsoft
And all you psuedos is Macintosh
With practice, ya’ll, I’m set to sabotage
And leave your face white as Asher Roth
Then come out the winner, leave the stage, and laugh it off
I never get tired, cause I aspire and require to be admired
And acquire the fame that I desire
That’s the future I see fit, the bars I spit
With quick wit is like every crime I commit
Rhyme criminal, subliminals leave you quizzable
As I become formidable and reaching my pinnacle
Like Einstein in his genius, pinpoint emcee’s weakness
With the thesis of zero-percent cleanness

[Verse 2]
Whenever I attack on 9th Wonder tracks
I take it back to the time where we don’t rhyme for stacks
We prove our skills that kill and pay the bills
And pray that our career never goes downhill
