(Verse 1)
Ion really care
Forty five make these fuckbois stare
Bullet or base all you hear is blare
I got the magnum bussing inside
Bitches be crushing the ride
Stuffing inside ask questions like you asking to die lift up that shirt or take a puff
Say you don't get high well ok
Ima grab the ak blow up like a hand grenade fucking snakes
Found out by the lake couple seen the body floatin out on a date
Report it and it ain't shit to swing by they place
Aimin at they face


(Hook)
I ain't taking no more bullshit
And if my name in your mouth
Expect a full clip

I ain't takin no more bullshit
Tell me where your momma stay
Fore you get this full zip



(Verse 2)
Started off all I wanted was a cool whip
Now I got a couple hunnids and bullpip quick to make that oil drip
Spray the automatics but good with the stick shift
Either fucking give you a facelift
I feel invincible but not on cape shit
CTS sitting on kongs bitch I'll go ape shit
Ain't no cook but I got bitches who bake shit
Interrogating where's my lawyer I won't say shit
Fucking informants on my case snitch
Prolly mad because I fucked his bitch
Too bad I coulda made him rich
Now he in a ditch I coulda made him rich

(Hook)
I ain't taking no more bullshit
And if my name in your mouth
Expect a full clip

I ain't takin no more bullshit
Tell me where your momma stay
Fore you get this full zip




(verse 3)
All I ever wanted is some hunnids
Money hungry hit a big lick might leave the country
Stacking racks up monthly
From the backwoods give it to you bluntly
No fake shit no wack stuff
Married to the money ya i got cuffed
Got a chicken in my pocket pockets stay stuffed
Bitch ask how I pay for the Louis duff
Ill pay the bill if you suck like monica
Swear to god officer I didn't inhale but I take a puff
Marijuana I got a surplus
Can get more delivery service
It all ends the same so I ain't even nervous
