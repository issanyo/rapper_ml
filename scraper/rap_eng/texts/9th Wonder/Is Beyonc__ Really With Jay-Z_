[Intro]
Shout out my nigga Skee, before we forget
Am I picking sides nigga (No way)
Oh word?

[Verse]
I warned this big booty bitch to stay sweet
I click and spray heat
Lay with me
A great 16 to break this beat
You 808 queens stay away from me
Giving base to fiend like Dre and Easy-E
My Chlamydia leaves blood stains on my jeans
And you gave it to me so you tainted my sleep
Pain I can't believe, but hey I wanna beat
I'll give you Aids for your freakiness
And rabies to be discreet
Have you laying like Raiden saying to Sweep
Silver is so whack, so don't ask why I want my fro back
A little kiss from Willow Smith and I catch a case
A basket case, Ally Sheedy meets Pastor Mase
A 9th Wonder dope track
Too bad he don't rap, come on

[Outro]
Threats, that's it
But, I get down
Yup, that's it
I get down, And all y'all (Know that)
Now where's my motherfuckin' comb at?
That's it
But, I get
Yup, that's it
I get down
And all y'all (Know that)
Now where's my motherfuckin' comb at?
