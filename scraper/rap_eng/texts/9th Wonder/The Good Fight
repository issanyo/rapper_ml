[Intro]
When you wake up this morning
I want you to go to the mirror
And I want you to look at yourself in the eyes and say
Fuck you, fuck your hopes, fuck your dreams, fuck all the good you thought this life was 'gon bring you
Now lets got out there and make this bitch happy

New Tigallo, New Tigallo, New Tigallo, New Tigallo

[Verse 1]
Up early with the sun, and the stars, 6 A.M. ring the alarm
Weather man say "it's 90 today but it gon' feel like 100 tomorrow
So throw some fresh water under the arms"
Bullshit soon as I come in the job
Boss hit me with the news like a box-cutter under the jaw
Said "they just had a meeting and about 3 hundred
Of y'all gettin fired cuz we been defunded"
Can't say I didn't even see it coming
I always knew that one day, they'd find a way to throw me to the wolves
And once they, came into my room on that Friday afternoon I was thinkin
"why you faggot ass niqqas couldn't find me on Monday"
I know it's not sane, but yo I'm just sayin
Everybody prays for the day they see the light
But the light at the end of the tunnel is a train
5 dollar gas, and poverty rates, are rising much higher than your hourly rates
So if you thinkin 'bout quittin you should probably wait
Cuz everybody gotta do a fuckin job that they hate
"Go and live out your dreams" thats what they tellin
Fam in my ear all day and they yellin
"Keep it real Te", and don't ever sellout
But how the fuck you sell out when ain't nobody sellin?

[Hook]
Tired of playin with yall, I wanna fight the good fight
But it ain't payin me dawg
N.C., *Make ya money*
VA, *Make ya money*
To my man still hustlin hard, tryin to get it at whatever the cost
Wherever you at or whoever you are, that's me *Make ya money*
All day *Make ya money*

[Verse 2]
It's like chasin a high, you just wanna get a hit
Just wanna get a taste, just wanna benefit
Everyday we wake up there's the legitimate
Struggle between doin whats right, and just doin some nigga shit
Baby bro wrote me say he feel he lost me
I'm like dude I'm tryin back the fuck up off me
My single friends say "Tay, ya family's beautiful"
I'm like if only y'all niqqas knew what it cost me
This shit don't come with no blueprints
And with every change it seems more like a game you could never win
I tell my peoples I ain't rich but this harvest is the farthest a broke niqqa ever been
"Go for ya dreams" that's what they tellin
Fam in my ear all day and they yellin
"Keep it real Te", and don't ever sellout
But what the fuck is sellin out if ain't nobody sellin?

[Hook]

Tired of playin with yall, I'm tryin to fight the good fight
But they ain't payin it dawg
N.C., *Make ya money*
VA, *Make ya money*
To my man still hustlin hard, where ya at or whoever you are
Coinstar pennies out of the jar
All day niqqa *Make ya Money*
Y'all remember that shit niqqa *Make ya money*
