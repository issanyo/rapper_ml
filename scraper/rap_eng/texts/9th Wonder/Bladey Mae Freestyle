Bless this mic and nobody who touch it
When I clutch it, I leave MCs in crutches if they dare to bring the ruckus
Like Wu-Tang, I'm the lyrical Liu Kang
Soon to blow up like Hussein, on top of the rap food chain
Top predator, eatin' up competitors
On the regular, I see right through you like a specular
Reflection, MCs best not step in my direction
I flow to perfection, something like natural selection
With the mic in my hand, we will never disband
Life's never been so grand, my lyrics never been bland
I construct flows like buildings, call me Tha Arkhitekt
Cause whenever I write, I'm 100% circumspect
Nervous emcees get wrecked, decked and chin-checked
By the flows I connect and inject
Respect the analysis, my style is the cannabis
Your style is blasphemous, your defeat is calamitous
