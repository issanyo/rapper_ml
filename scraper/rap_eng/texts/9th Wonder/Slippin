[Verse 1:]
Slippin, slippin
Slippin into the darkness
Spark this, everybody know that’s how we start this
Come home to fight night, UFC
Tough with that Keratin, you best be
I kept my eyes on my pockets like the USD’s
Ridin home from school on the USB’s
See my father didn’t teach me how to stick up
And where he left off all my best friends picked up
It had my soul twist up
Trapped in that Soulnado
Used to be a angel but I lost my Halo
Then I learned to stay low, cuz I had my wings ripped off
I was movin’ cars nigga, with the engines off
I would try to rap, chokin’ on my sins and cough
My veins were frozen pumpin out that crimson frost
It had me slippin’

[Verse 2:]
Runnin’ with green devils, and I mean green devils
I had never seen levels of a high so low
I knew some mean fellas who was deep green jealous
Locked me up in mental cellars they was threatened by the flow
And I didn’t even know, I accepted my fate
Was a pupil and I waited for the rest to dilate
Had my number dialed late, ain’t nobody left to buzz
Couldn’t see the picture my screen’s covered with with fuzz
Spent a lot of life’s years trekking light years to write here
Faced a lot of foes, old ghosts and my fears
Real men never hide the past and I’m proud of that
Put me under pressure and I made a diamond out of that
So we be signin out of that, see me climbin’ out of that
Ditch that I was in, nigga holla back
So now I’m back and I’m... Spittin these Axioms
Thought I’d impress ya, take the pressure to maximum
Swing on a pendulum, problems: here’s how handle em
Change what I can and stay poised like Mannequin
