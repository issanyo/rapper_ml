[First Verse]
Can you feel this murderous rhythm bringin' to the surface the killer within
As I erase fake suckas who claim they ice cold but I'm chillin'
Colder than steel and the kind of heat I'm packin' is Truth never concealin'
I kill my enemies with kindness so you can say I'm buildin'
Diggin' brothers and sisters out the trap then the hole I'm sealin'
Rarely have you seen someone as realin'
Never find dirt on me cause everything from what you see to behind the scenes I'm revealin'
Only if you real muthafucka then I'm dealin' withcha
If you ain't 'bout healin' then I'm flippin' a switcher
Hitcha with that raw shit yet you come back for more
'cause to your core you know this that shit which makes us truly richer
Lemme run that by one mo' time
I hitcha with that raw shit yet you come back for more
'cause to your core you know this that shit which makes us truly richer

[Chorus 2x]
Murderous rhythm excuse me as I git' 'em
Form follows function I'm not the best but I'm amid 'em
Those who by any degree doubt your dreams rid 'em
No need for violence just do what I do and let the rhythm hit 'em

[Second Verse]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Bump this loud with your windows down as you roll through and ride
It ain't even a choice cause if you truly dope you wouldn't have to decide
Real brothers and sisters never really die
That's why I don't fuss 'bout bein' revived
But I do despise lies so it's universal I don't take sides
Suckas make the mistake of thinkin' I'm weak cause love  is my guide
I say it now mu'fuckas like that ain't worth my time
Plus, why is peace seen as something weak?
Future's lookin' bleak but if that causes you to stop from improving oblique
Don't misunderstand me, fuck a plan B cause it robs energy from plan A
Content potent flow sweeter than candy
Dandy is not what life is but I still get done what can be
Take these words to heart guaranteed they'll be handy
Simplicity is the highest form of complexity
To hell with fancy

[Chorus]
