[First Verse]
It's funny how this model of society works
This song's 'bout certain twerks focusing on water works
And how it's perfectly fine when a woman twists left
But when a man cries it's so far from right only wrong is left
If you a boy and someone sees you cryin' that's taboo
If you're afraid to show your true self you ain't a man (that's true)
This what we raise our youth into
So many people not one with themselves or anything
If they close it's at least two
Why is that men crying is blasphemy?
“Be tough pull yo'self together get your act together B!”
As a result we get 20- 30- 40- year old boys
Who don't know how to deal with their emotions shiittt
Physically Men who are empty mentally and spiritually
Try to fill the void with over aggressiveness
Thing is they externalize all their energy so they don't change a damn thang within themselves uh
Mecca Rebell here to say a real man is not afraid
To fully feel life with its sunshine plus the shade
Understand all aspects of life we are made
Without sour times there wouldn't life's sweet lemonade
Run that back run that back run that back run that back run that back now uh
Understand all aspects of life we are made
Without sour times there wouldn't be life's sweet lemonade

[Chorus 2x]
It's okay to cry du don't be afraid
Scars be the essence which the strong are made
Pure tears remind fear to not come near
The courageous one who finds strength from weakness is revered

[Bridge: Brianti]

[Second Verse]
Yin yang is that thang
Freedom bells rang
The type that only in complete silence can you hear it clang
Funny how there's so much truth to be found in things ironic
Like how my bare skin more powerful than the two-ton tunic
Strength from weakness toughness from softness
You'll learn this to be true as you progress on your process
Check what I mean like a bamboo versus willow
If your husband is the latter prepare to be a widow
Swim against the current
Fight against the wind you can't win
Difference 'tween oars and sails is wisdom
Whats builds within let it out don't hold it in
Lettin' it boil inside just amplifies the explosion so
Let it go like the out breath
Relax to enter hard through the easy way is how I OD on the METH
Life's only possible through exhale and inhale
Half and half take one out and oh well...

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
