Come on home, come on home
Come on home, come on home

[Verse 1]
I’m back talking that shit again
Oh, perfect game I’m just pitching them
Been on this road for a minute, should call Michelen Quentin
You only human, I say as if god listenin’
Let me work this out make sure I get my fitness in
See another day I’m checking off my bucket list again
All they care about is who you fuck and what you whipping in
Fishtailing a back road, black hole I’m slipping in
See my partners hook me up cause they hustle like fisherman
All gold everything but I write with Egyptian pens
Oh, music help keep the weak together
When we together she candy coated, sweet as nectar
My old life is old spice I been free of pepper
They like “you went form good, great to even better”
No election I’m running I could teach a leopard
Faith is when you know you fly when you just got a piece of feather
A little different from hers, hers and him
But I’mma splash I got birds having the urge to swim
Take a note from earth and wind, we all got reasons
This world’s where we’ll be till we all stop breathing
We all not angels but we all not demons
We ain’t got chains on but we all not freemen
Like jebodiah of heaven higher then I’mma need a
Helicopter if not I’ll cop a angel off a needle
Did this shit for lil bob, rest in peace little [?]
They just sick now and then, I’m a permanent fever
I’mma be here for a minute, change for the meter?
Thought I was playing til they paying change for a feature
I work my ass off but my brain dizzy
Society crazy I shoulda brought ‘caine with me
Instead I brought a notepad and pain with me
Pops tell me keep playing don’t let that fame get me
Shorty duwop get a shot can you blame [Bizee?]
She try to reach me but can’t cause I remain busy
I never sleep so these bed bugs ain’t bit me
I ain’t your bodyguard bitch and shit you ain’t Whitney
My favourite rapper still Pac, but I aim Biggie
I wish I had my own world like I made Mickey
I want enough bread in my pocket to lay in Jiffy
They way I rap I stand out like a Vegas hickey
More dues, I’m paying plenty, play is tricky
Just laugh at ‘em never lettin’ what they say offend me
I chase Henny, my bottle float til the bay is empty
When I be outta town they love how I display my city
Grade school my bae was way cool
Til that one day we split up in the alley like Trae and Ricki
I know my real folk, I just hope I keep ‘em with me
A lotta snakes around but I never let ‘em constrict me
Waited a while for this, my brotha say I’m wild for this
Think I’m getting back in shape, I ran an extra mile for this

[Bridge]
I’m back talkin’ that shit again, oh!
I’m back talkin’ that shit again, oh!
I’m back talkin’ that shit again, oh!

[Verse 2]
My life taking a wide turn, feet feel numb and my eyes burn
Guess they gotta wait for me to sign a cheque
You sick of being broke, getting money’s a side effect
Grooving, moving like needle speed when I lie detect
I ain’t into politics, I just got a high connect
Looks on your faces say “I’m impressed”
I’m half man, half amazing with a lion chest
Part of me is good with life but part of me just need some things
I just keep playing two people like I’m Regina King
No slide I’m still swinging
These rappers is comedy like Varnell Hill singing
Love the way the boy bounce back I’m still springing
And calls from them unknown numbers still ringing, oh!
At the crib blowing my face off, watching face off
My day like Malaysian planes never can I take off
Pray for them just like I pray for us
Swear even the small shit can hurt you like a paper cut
Can’t conduct properly, I’m propane fear
I’m just all the way out here Kash, control shit when no name said
My niggas say I’m ill as fuck, I’m girl say I’m real as fuck
The world say the same things we love what be killing us
I can make the best out look like an underachiever
Better than [?] fucking with me, I’m hafta go with neither
In the next life, I’mma wanna meet myself
I can’t swallow my pride so will it eat itself?
I try to piece myself together, oh
Can I feel this good forever, oh
I just had to demonstrate
Rated Oakland for the summer, this here’s a picnic plate, boy

[Verse 3]
Other day I had a talk with a teenager
Like he saw a ghost way his face was made up
84th and Birch where he reside, hella drama collide
Ask him what he wanna be when he grow up, told me “alive”
Sirens in the backdrop, he started to flashback
Age 9, him and his mom on the AmTrak
Leaving everything behind except memories
When life had you bugging you travel like centipedes
Every day all he do is see his mom stress
Can’t talk to pop, he the reason that they in this mess
35 with a 35 to L, no parole
Took a hit from the bottle right before he lost control
Lost his job, got a baby comin’, can’t tell his wife
Now he drunk driving on slick roads and rainy nights
Back to the car swervin’, panic and tire screechin’
Vehicle came to a halt now he at fault
Body on the asphalt just motionless
With enough evidence to spot who the culprit is
Doin’ what she can, Uncle Sam say it ain’t enough
Momma too busy, so myself I can’t conduct properly
Start to let the world just influence him
Had the wrong people in his ear start boostin’ him
Up to a plateau, classroom in the back row
Fuck school if I pass will they let my dad go?
Mind set daddy in, mommy try to keep him calm
Now the only thing that have him chill is what he cheefing on
Keep getting kicked outta schools, he on his third one
Used to be an honor roll student
And momma just left the doc, she having another son
But she don’t have a husband there to help her groom him
Days get longer, momma still working shifts
He still cutting class with friends in stolen whips
Slide cars and puff green, that’s five stars
Blank out, wake up missing like five calls
Sooner how he should checked his call log
Unknown numbers, a voicemail his heart falls
Out of his chest, soon as he got the news
That his mom and little brother to be had been abused
By a man his mom secretly fooled with
Before his pops even start doing his time, losin’ his mind
Talking through a glass, pops get a visitation
Son looking at him face full of desperation
Tell him what happened, now pops pissed in disbelief
One for what’s going on and one that his wife would cheat
Life is deep, mad as fuck, tear drop, wipe his cheek
Shake his head, tell his son “you know this ain’t the life for me”
Silence falls between ‘em
His son looked at him said “yea, but you the reason”
