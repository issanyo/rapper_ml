[Verse : Kaythenum]
I write my thoughts and fight these wars/ I fringe the law, No crime is fought/ The lines i jot, Decline your force/ After the rhymes i drop, A life a lost/ Look at these clamin' they trigger finger's itchin' busy takin' shots tryna kill me, Watch as i force their own attacks make them fall victim/ My scrimbbling ancient, Killing six with the same verse Just shut your lame-ass, Don't test my patience, They all got aids..... Wait', My reigns heavy, What's poppin' lately? Via mailbox these infants be calling baby!
You don't, I'll darken your day my raps are shady
Still the best, I'll seal your death by spitting fact
I've scene your acts, I'm quite real, And what i sin is blessed
