[Intro] [Percy Talking]
I'm gonna do what the people in Texas call 'Chop & Screw' this one

[Verse One] [Percy Talking]
You never heard me sexy on a track before
We're gonna take this one to the club ladies and gentlemen
Now, what I want to happen...I want the utmost participation
From everyone in the house tonight
You see, back when I was coming up. The club was a little bit different
You did not have the VIP section. You did not have a champagne room
All you had was a dance floor
A dance floor
A dance floor
A dance floor
A dance floor

[Chorus]
All my ladies get on the flo'
Let me get some mo'
Get on your dance flo'
Ladies get on the flo'
Shake it and give me some mo'
Get on the dance flo'
The dance flo'

[Verse Two] [Percy talking]
Now don't let me start callin' out ladies that I see on the dance floor
I see some ladies in the house tonight that I'd love to take there
I look out into the crowd I see Janet Stampler
Janet Stampler, there is a term that goes around and I won't use it because it's rather derogatory
But that term is called MILF. And with that term MILF
It means, a mother that I would like to fornicate with
And although my fornicating days are over..

[Chorus]
I take you to the dance flo'
To the dance flo'
I take you to the dance flo'
The dance flo'
I take you to the dance flo'
To the dance flo'
I take you to the dance flo'
To the dance F-L-O

[Verse Three] [Percy talking]
And speaking of "O". There is another lady in the house tonight that I'd like to say hello to
And that lady is Julie Greenwald
Now you know, I never have been with a lady of the Jewish faith
But there was one lady that I had, back in '69
And she was a Jewish lady. And she took me home to meet her father
And her father told me, "Percy, you have what is known as 'chutzpah'
And chutzpah is a term that our Jewish brothers and sisters use that means you are sweet
It means you have style. It means you have grace and elegance
And Julie Greenwald I just want you to know..

[Chorus]
I take you to the dance flo'
To the dance flo'
To the dance flo'
To the dance flo'
To the dance flo'
To the dance flo'
Put on my Yamaka
And take you to the dance flo'
Oooooooh

[Verse Four] [Percy talking]
Now, there's one last lady I'd like to talk about
She is a lady I see out in the crowd tonight
And she's so young. And she looks so corruptible. And so sweet
Her name is Latrice Burnett
Now Latrice Burnett, when I first met her
She reminded me, I have a niece that's around her age
So I was kinda reluctant to talk to her
But there was just something about her innocence that screamed, that screamed "Take me."
It said, "Take me." It said, "Take me."
And so while I have not taken her yet, there is one place I will take her
And do you know where that is?

[Chorus]
To the dance flo'
To the dance flo'
Take her to the dance flo'
To the dance flo' hoe
To the dance flo'
To the dance flo'
To the dance flo'
Ooooooh
