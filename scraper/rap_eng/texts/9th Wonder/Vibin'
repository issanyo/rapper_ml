[Hook]
Ridin', vibin', deep into the night'n
Everytime I'm rhymin' feels like I'm glidin'
I do what I love and what it does is love me back
How can your life have power if you don't first plug the jack?
Truth in the booth, soup for the soul be what I cook
Everytime my soul flow on the track off I go
Live it yourself never take what others say for fact
Trust instincts take your time and do it right relax

[First Verse]
I do what I feel is right listenin' to my heart
It makes this complicated world simple
Why make it more hard?
I don't understand that
How a child gets life to the bone
While a grownup's stuck with the fat
Fuck confinin' abstract to right and exact
Cause when we do that, life is what we lack
The system tries to bring me down stuff me in a box
But I bounce right back and other peoples' chain I help unlock
It's not what we oughta do but something we naturally gravitate to
Don't believe me? Check what a free child do
By free I mean not corrupted mentally spiritually
Life's something to feel not just intellectually
We're livin' in segments lifeless be what it is
Trust that voice that says there's more to life than this
The depth of every moment do you miss?
Don't get caught up in the lexicon but I got words to live by and they go like this

[Hook]

[Second Verse]
Have you ever noticed that when doubt's closest to your heart
From your center you feel the farthest apart?
Balance, that's the challenge
Cause if you off right or lean too left life will be hard to manage
Prepare for damage
That's why I wield my shield as I tread this field of life
To defend myself 'gainst muthafuckas overtaken by vice
Their bellies over belts still don't give a slice
This is why the sword that is the mic is in my hand
I don't fear the scythe!
Do you? If you don't answer or question for yourself
Someone else will gladly do
That's the truth
Too many peeps are bitter but I still got my sweet tooth
By flowing thu canals of love's roots
Fuck tradition choreo your own story like a freelance dancer
To dull souls creativity looks like disaster
Life's a huge fill-in-the-blank for us to write our answers
Livin' a life that's not meant for us equivalent to cancer

[Hook]
