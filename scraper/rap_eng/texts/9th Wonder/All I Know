[Hook] [Kal Royal]:
All I know
I've been cool for too long
I'm so tired
And my nerves are just gone

[Verse One] [Jozeemo]:
Yo, I try to chill but I can't
Well I can but I ain't
Cause I never hurt a Saint
Jo Ziggy, Roll Wit me
Blow sticky cause I'm stressed out
Time to whip the vest out
Holster under either shoulder Soulja, Smif N' Wess'ed out
Now I got's to get it in, you should be considerin'
"Is Jo' just talkin' reckless or he really on that shit again?"
Juggernaut gymnastic acrobatic ratchet tumbler
Bold nigga humbler, bring it to any one of ya
Cockin' a 'What the Fuck', you don't know what that is
But when it bang, you be like what the fuck just happened to my leg?
Wheelchair niggas forever, shit bag and then some
To take a bath you gon' need Mr. Belvedere and Vincent
Not to mention I be poppin' Oxycontin's faithfully
If I got the eight with me then you should stay away from me
Joe Young, King of the Jungle, Guerilla Tactics
Pump a slug into you cowards and watch ya back flip

[Hook] [Jozeemo] (Kay Royal)
(All I know)
You niggas talking about kickin' in doors
Like I ain't got a hammer bigger than yours
(I've been cool for too long, cool for too long)
(I'm so tired)
Pussy niggas wanna take my shine
Well, see the chrome? Come holla bitch, take my nine
(And my nerves are just gone, nerves are just gone)

[Verse Two] [Sean Price]:
Ayo Asalama Laikum, Alakium Salaam
Sean you taking too long to make a song
Fuck it
I make it strong when I make a song
And I can tell by my sales you ain't wait for Sean
I take it back like to the break of dawn
Break ya arm, Sean a wrestler
One Life To Live, Carlos Hessler
You just a human poster or a vest-tester
The sket-presser the wet wetter than red sweater
The Def Leopard, the best effort, you can't rock
Am I new, or some old nigga who can't stop?
Listen, I rap rings around niggas, clap things about nigga
See you later, y'all muthafuckas is haters
Four fit for the four-fifth flasher
Flash the four-fifth in ya face, make plaster
David Blaine duke, Abra-Cadabra
I wave the thing, poof, I got to get at ya
I'm already THA rapper

[Hook]
