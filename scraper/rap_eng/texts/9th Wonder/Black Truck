[Verse 1]
I've been through the fire
I felt embers down my spine
And I've said "World would you please have some mercy on me?
Or could you please lift the curses on me?"
It said, you always did
Like it the hard way since you was a kid
Look at the scars on your leg, you know
You keep choosing the wild road

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm not sorry
Stay sick cause I follow my gut
They say I was pushing my luck
Ima push me a matte all black truck
No, I'm not sorry
Stay sick cause I follow my gut
They say I was pushing my luck
Ima push me a all black truck
Ima push me a all black truck
Ima push me a matte all-

[Verse 2]
I been through the storm
I heard thunder in my heart
And I've said "World would you please shine a light up on me?
Or would you show me a sign you love me?"
It said, you always did
Like it the hard way since you was a kid
Time after time, again
You keep the choosing the wild road

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm not sorry
Stay sick cause I follow my gut
They say I was pushing my luck
Ima push me a matte all black truck
No, I'm not sorry
Stay sick cause I follow my gut
They say I was pushing my luck
Ima push me a all black truck
Ima push me a all black truck
Ima push me a matte all black truck
Stay sick cause I follow my gut
They say I was pushing my luck
Ima push me a matte all black truck
