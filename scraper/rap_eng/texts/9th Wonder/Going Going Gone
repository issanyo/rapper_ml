[Verse 1]
I woke up early in the A.M. [?]
Favourite lines mi amor, [?]
Leaders lead the blind I’m seeing through ‘em like an x-ray
Layin out my plans like it’s clothes for the next day
Grindin’ [?] tryna make it major in rap
Ain’t no chaser for that
Streets got a hangover like wet rags on towel racks
[?] stays on my mind [?] like [?] had
Life is much shorter what we thought it would be
Living so close to hell make heaven harder to see
Moses never seen the Promised Land but parted the sea
So my soul is still the sample and my heart is the beat
More drama than four baby mommas
And problems always seem to come back like karma, man
But if you ain’t growin’ then you dyin’
Can’t touch the sky if you have a fear of flyin’

[Hook]
Now we rockin’ and she rollin’
If you down with a nigga let me know
That’s when we stopped in, see we all in
So we goin goin goin goin gone

[Verse 2]
Man, I say with every song I hop on they wonder why I’m not on
Land on these tracks just to put my train of thought on
[?] than bein’ tired and fiends put it together
Like [?] when rings close cats like *ding* y’all know what I mean
Spitting fire like Dhalsim can’t douse us
Won’t stop til pockets is fatter than Fat Albert’s
Treat my albums like boats cause I’m hopin’ they sell
Cause my bills got me scared to even open my mail
But all my homies is like Talib Kweli, tryna get by
But all they money is so low that they can’t even get high
And that’s a shame, not a dolla to my name
Overdrafts to the bank, makin’ change by makin’ change
They tryna make it rain, just hopin’ that the clouds pass
But some things never change like black berry molasses
Tryna make a name when they don’t know you exist
Hope there’s somethin’ out there better than this

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I told ‘em one of these days I’mma be on this stage
Back when I was rockin’ shows was hopin’ one of them’d pay
Working harder than a slave no whips or no chains
Tryna come up from the dirt like worms when it rains
Did you notice man, they say they know this man
Cause I be comin’ out your speakers like I was, uh, Kazam
They went from sorta hating to only seeing him when I’m needin’ more order takin’
Tryna match what I’m doin’ but we ain’t corrdinatin’
See we tryna bring the feel back, the skill
This Add, Add-2 gon’ bring the real back
My peoples need a hero or a heroine
I could give ‘em hope but they could find it in a needle filled with heroin
Came from the Chi, jam, butter, sugar and rice
To chilling in Chapel Hill eatin’ chicken with Ninth
See there’s the choices when it come to life
See you can either prove ‘em wrong or prove ‘em right
I chose the first

[Hook]
