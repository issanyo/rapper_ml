[Verse 1]
I wanna fly beyond the sky
Higher than where the airplanes glide
I wanna sail the seven seas and maybe visit all of the countries
I want you to come along
Life is better when we’re not alone
And we might make a very good team
And then we could reach our every dream
But you always got something sad to talk about
Always walking with a heart full of doubt
You don’t seem to to see all of the possibilities
And I wanna make you happy
I want you to be free
But there seems to always be
Forces of gravity
Weighing you down
And i want you to fly with me

[Chorus]
So darling, won't you open your eyes
How can you be so blind to the beauty of life
It's everywhere so won't you dare
To open your eyes
How can you be so blind to the beauty of life
It's everywhere so won't you dare to open your eyes

[Verse 2]
I wanna explore the oceans floor
And see things no one's ever seen before
I wanna build a jungle mansion
Just like the Swiss Family Robinson
I want you to live there with me
Otherwise it might get lonely
And could be a dynamic duo
Makin' up our own rules
But you don't believe in yourself enough
You always settle when things get tough
You don't seem to know
All of your potential
And I wanna make you happy
I want you to be free
But there seems to always be
Forces of gravity
Weighing you down
And i want you to fly with me

[Chorus]
So darling, won't you open your eyes
How can you be so blind to the beauty of life
It's everywhere so won't you dare
To open your eyes
How can you be so blind to the beauty of life
It's everywhere so won't you dare to open your eyes
