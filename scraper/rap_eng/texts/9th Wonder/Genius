[Intro]

[Verse 1: Sundown]
Freaking Genius, summa cum laude
The highest quality back up offa me
Made the Dean's list rocking with that scholarship
I'm a problem with the boys in my conglomerate
The Academy, head of my class
And I ask if you study by your footnotes
Cuz I pass my finals with ease
And it’s a breeze like wind blowing leaves
IQ is somthin’ like a hundred forty
Genius level, please he’s a devil
Surpass excellence, you can’t step to him
Without a mortar board while I transform a metaphor
Prime Optimus, Einstein rocking in my rare form
With 9th chopping a rare score
What’s a pure genius, choppin freakin seamless
Download it, you can internetly stream it
Find a sample, gut it, clean it
And fish scale it for people who really need it
Its food for thought

Sundown’s a freakin genius, genius genius genius
Sundown’s a freakin Genius. Its food for thought
Sundown’s a freakin Genius
Sundown’s a freakin Genius. Its food for thought
Sundown’s a freakin Genius

[Verse 2: Enigma]
I'm a genius, paint pic’s relay scripts cuz ya’ll need it
Hate this I shape shift change my features
Make hits from heat to your plate, E feed em’
Classic idish for you niggas please believe it
Blast it on Twitter for real I’ll have em’ tweetin’
Statuses on high the stratosphere I’ll reach when I act on the proof
I’m the badest on the beat straight madness in the booth
Get it right I am E. E. I am he like try my team like
You see me shining right and bright like high beams, relax your mind
Open your lungs to breathe it
