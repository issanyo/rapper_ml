And mama said "Tread lightly
Your skin color is fare you bread lightly.
What might seem like an advantage to some
May add vanity son and that can come back to bite me."
Fighting with my child hood other n****s would pester him
I swear to God I even thought I was Mexican
I messed around made a mess and found the mess
Was bound to expect a sound that would over drown and fester in
But either Way I had to leave the Bay
The only reason why n****s even believe today
And if I would've stayed, I probably would've played right in to the hands of these jealous n****s they keep at bey
But is all just semantics
I used to press up flyers and do van hits
Now your n**** pressing down the Van Wyck
I know you can't stand it. Right?

Anesha:
Go against the grain I'm not in the crowd, the crowd, the crowd. Oh they could
Never break me down. They can't break me down down down

And papa said never spite me. Because of my belief these other rappers won't
Like me. Instead of switching I'm keeping the same position. These lame n****s
That b****ing I tell them to come and bite me. Fighting with demons and n****s
Think that it's horseplay. I portray what I feel is needed of course they, wanna
Take a n**** spot cause they see a bigger plot, until face to face with my work
Then they rapport change. And can you blame fools. They was given this dream
Like they just can't lose. Explain who can refrain from eating the same food
Without a change not go insane or vomit on they shoes. I paid dues in this
Region we need variety. I think these high n****s feel threatened by my
Sobriety. But it's all just semantics, I know you can't stand it

And mama said tread lightly, your skin color is fare you bread lightly. What
Might seem like an advantage to some may add vanity son and that can come back
To bite me
And papa said never spite me. Because of my belief these other rappers won't
Like me. Instead of switching I'm keeping the same position. These lame n****s

And sister used to tell me please Ali don't be a fool. If you gonna do this
Music, use rap a vehicle. See this can me your tool. But if you ain't saying
Something meaningful to people then you probably need to be in school. Well I
Guess I kept my promise but instead of being thankful they judge me for being
Honest. And this is just a prelude o pray you portray dude in the proper light
Just don't write me off as sone Bay dude. Explain who can refrain from eating
The same food without a change not go insane it's you playing pool. And for that
Profit these n****s get out of pocket, they watching you from them corners for
On that green and waving too. And the white stick is the night stick and
Everybody's balling from moving that white b****. Life slips and it's more than
Just semantics, I know you can't stand it, right?

Go against the grain I'm not in the crowd, the crowd, the crowd. Oh they could
Never break me down. They can't break me down down down. Down
