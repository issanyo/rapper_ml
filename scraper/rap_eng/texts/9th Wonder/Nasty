From the dawn of time, i was destined to shine
If you take one of mine, i take one of yours
So its a day in a life of a young dope pimp
I'm just a stubborn typa fella with a head like a brick
And just because i step it up, they say that im hopeless
But i dont give a fuck, so blame it on my lockness

I spit hard lines,im smooth as a prism
So watch me turn it up on this funky ass rhythm
And by the corner of my eye, i see a mama looking fly
So baby dont talk, just hold your breath
And mama slow down, come chill with the gang
Im talking to the pretty face, big booty lil thang
To the right, damn right.yeah mama you my type
Tell your man, lay low. he better move to the left
If he tryna act a fool he get beat to death

If you read between the lines,you can see through the lies
Im putting you fakers to sleep, goodnight kisses get blown
Cause to emcee requires skills, i demand some shown

Now hands to our chest,pledge allegiance to the swagg
Im tryna do my thing for the streets that pay me
So i pour one for my boys and two for my family
And three for the day i succumb to my enemy

The government puts taxes on my bread so i got a toaster up in my head
Mama wanna raise me right, she talking harvard or yale
But my mind was set foul,i seen projects and jail
Im not afraid to die but how to live until then
Who am i gonna lose next,afraid to read the next text
Cause it might be talking about my homie being shot
Or the lady that was robbed weak, aged, and cold
Wonder who could be so bold?
The streets getting harsh and the evil wanna swallow us
If you slipping and you tripping, you going back in the dust

Shit, whats a young nigga to do to get big?
Do i got join the Illuminati to get you to notice?
Hell nah, im true to the cause and right by God
So i might not be a christian,but that don't define what o believe in
So lets get it popping its just a while that we living
I got no love for you fakers cause you envy
What i am, what you prolly done and made me
Ha...
