[Verse 1]
Y’all rap with no feeling, I’m ice, I’m cold chilling
Remove your whole ceiling, you evil but no villain
These boys don’t know what being a man is about
Quick to pull they thing out but slow to take care of they child
See I’m Destiny’s child but I ain’t singing a note
Used to wanna bang Beyonce but I was too broke
No disrespect to Jay-Z, you my idol
Hip-hop was dead ’til it went through a revival
Don’t need no recital, no practice is necessary
Not gon’ stop, until the day that I become legendary
But on the contrary, mainstream is not the way I wanna go
‘cause half of them dudes sold they soul
And I’m sorry if I put you on blast
But the people don’t know ‘cause they too scared to ask
Remove the mask, do you see me in my physical
Form? ‘bout to make my dreams more visual
Flow reckless, grab you by your necklace or chain
When rappers get a piece of change then they change
Like Voltron, ambitious and hope’s on
The dead tree loose leaf that I wrote on
Tryna get by like a girl that’s confused
‘cause she had her heart broken by so many dudes
I hate to have to battle dude
You like a Microsoft program on a Mac so you not compatible
Choose another avenue before you cruise on my street
Plus I know some dudes that will take the shoes off your feet

[Chorus]
These my colorful dreams
What, word, these my colorful
Uh, yeah, these my colorful
Word, yeah, these my colorful dreams, word

[Verse 2]
Uh, these my colorful dreams, wha-wha, what
These my colorful dreams
That was me on that one way street
All the pain with the [?] and my voice couldn’t speak
But I wanted them to hear
But that was the least of my fears
At least they couldn’t see all my tears
And even when I had the urge
To smoke the herd away, I never lit the herb
Not at all, brah
‘cause that would make my words hypocritical
When I tell the youth don’t smoke ‘cause it’s pitiful
Hospitable, it’s not the way they retrieve me
When I had shows, won’t nobody come see me
I guess ‘cause my music was different
That’s the reason that nobody tried to listen
But I kept trying hoping I would get there one day
They’ll hear me out someday
It’s my destiny, I’ve been through the fire
So when the smoke clears, all you’re gonna see is me

[Chorus]
These my colorful dreams
Uh, yeah, these my colorful
Uh, word, these my colorful
Uh, yeah, these my colorful dreams
