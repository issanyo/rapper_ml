My body giving out. I probably should doubt, but you're all that I think about. Giving out all of my thinking. Giving up drinking, all of it. Trying not to call it quits. I ball a fist and punch the wall, jump off a bridge just to see what's under. One injection, my thumb can question the death. But it's not enough. It's gotta be love between us. At least, I guess. I wonder why I need to stress. Every night I take a vacation, and we can call it "rest."

In the 80s, playing Pong. You saying everything I say is wrong. Hard to get along in a day, when a day may belong to us. You or... Your beauty is for this. Morbid to get a kiss. More fortunate to live with than you could ever imagine. Best friends, but I'm better at rapping. A veteran with this action. Cigarette in my hand, never will it pass up. Never will I pass. I wish and guess. No disrespect, immortality battling me. Chivalry, come after me. Chase me for a change! Chase me for the change. I chase thee for the brain. Get insane, you know what I'm about. 9th Wonder on the scratches

Can't forget like DJ Clue. What we say we do stays in-between us. Los Angeles nights, Los Angeles fright. Chick came in the crib, talking about she can "handle it right." Probably trying to handle the white, not a handjob. A propaganda problem. Can't stop with my dancing, damaging Harlem again. Why they robbing me, man? It's like my property, damn. Everything, real estate. Feeling this deep groove in the realest way, it's a real escape. I'm too real to be seen
