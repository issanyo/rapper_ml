[Intro]
Yeah
Big homie actin' up and shit
Yeah
Town business, town business
You know, Jam-Roc
That Wisdom out too, get that, you know
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Let me take 'em back to them purple and gold days
No Nicole Kidman, in my class just Nicole Reyes
Dress code, Gap hoodie, beanie and some old Jays
One below, granny serving breakfast on a cold trays
All I did was hoop and shit
Tech playing, rush the gym
Cousin said he coming through, triple-double just for him
Lil' nigga paid my dues, gimme my exact change
Shit, I had Roy Williams sitting at a Mack game
I ain't change
Still will get eliminated,[?]
East Oakland bitch, your bitch gave me a wink she know
Jack running back jumping, drunk as fuck, [?]
With a chick from Holy names, talking to us, preacher's can't
90 & Mack that where my childhood and mind be at
Sleepwalking insomniac no telling where you'll find me at
Best friend from seminary, hate that fact Al's closed
Havenscourt, Ruth's Steak, had the black and mild clothes
Never been a street nigga, I just be around those
Don't need no cred
Shit, my family fed? Then I'm good bro, yeah
[?] going through it, still dealing with wild hoes
Family with a home one day , hope we never oust those
Blessings worth more than problems
Boy you better count those
Pray for all my niggas and everyone of their households
Chyna growing up on me, just sent me her prom pics
Migo turned 3 this year, crazy how time ticks
Chapel Hill taught alot, Franklin Street gave me love
Leaving Avalon lit, then we hit Miami Subs
And that Carolina blue was everywhere the camera was
Those rocking Taylors and they was on us like Amber was
Bring it to life don't let them ghost story stain the attics
Don't blame people just blame their habits
Partners had Nike plugs
Always threw me kicks before they became established
I knew Ray boy played with Mavericks
Got you after money, huh?
Turn a paper boy into a paper savage
Communication remain ecstatic
All theses niggas want is fame and hella wack bitches saying they the baddest
Man, they all the same, they're average
I just book a plane for practice, even with some practice you ain't got this
I just caught a fly using chopsticks, its funny
I use tell a couple folk to watch this, they wouldn't look
Now they're telling other folk to watch this, I got this
Period, serious when the scotch hit
It feel like I'm flying but really I'm still an ostrich
This for you, yeah for you, let me talk to my reflection
Thanks to Rap's verse I'm confident in my complexion
Obama dropped the mic, who's signing at the next election?
Millions said he gon' be best at flexing when he done with 24
I seen 24 be done with 60 cat, Mike ain't even leave like that
This that E1 flow boy
In the deep I've seen sharks turn to a po-boy, oh boy
Friends of mine tried to help, granted they just take me for
So now when they hit my phone, their name won't show
Lotta people hold a grudge I let it go at lightning speed
Shout out to my nigga 9th I'm Justice League to Ivy Leagues
Real niggas get it where they at, [?]
Shooting these lines but I hope the guns get put away
And that's real man
I've been real before Uber buildings, when Oakland had stupid killings
Shaking like moving buildings I'm losing it
Shit just gives me the chills man
Yeah, for real man
For real man
And Beas I think this shit is way more than skill man

[Outro]
Town nigga
Jam-Roc
Ya dig
