[Verse 1: ?]
What goes up must come down (so amazing)
What goes up must come down, so amazing
Like ya ego once they finally peep my finals rating
You so loved in every sense but you love hating
Like I was Chris still tryna get an education
Revelations which verse do you need
You make music, does your melody bleed?
Take time, let ya hi hat breathe
All I got is one mic moving at Nasir speed
Time on the line, past your timeline feed
We still hungry
Intoxi-faded off that 18 dummy
Chilling with 18 dummies, tryna fill 18 tummies
Man I ain't racing for the paper but I'm telling we run it
Keep it 300, this is Sparta, no this the art of
Cutting up just like a barber
I'm dedicated like Mr. Carter, the life and times
Takes me farther, I touch the mic, I'm a fire starter
Sorta like Pepsi to a moonwalker
You [in a verse?] and I'm Bob Barker
It gets harder

It gets way harder
Yea
Look

[Verse 2: ?]
I told niggas
But I think it's time that I showed niggas
The real is back, niggas wack, we ain't feeling that
Kill a track in a minute flat, maybe more
They say keys open doors
I spit crack, I'm a kingpin, get them things in and sell it for the low
They telling me I'm dope
They just stating the obvious
I've been on the rise for a while now
See me in the sky, look how high he is
Clothes ain't designer but still look at how fly he is
Dressed to kill, you best bet is to check your will
I ain't flexing boy, every nigga that's in my section is ill
And we ain't impressed by ya skill, that's basic, and we top notch
Everything we drop elevate, everything you drop flop
They like "Swank you been wylin"
Don't get it twisted just because I been silent
Squad like the Warriors, yea that's too many stars
Come check out these life sentences, boy that's too many bars
