[Verse 1]
9th Wonder beat ill yeah I said it before
But I learnt how to filp it tryna blow like c4
Turnt off the green shit Yo Tegel we need more
They kill for the bill
This roach got skill
But can you skill a roach
Squeeze it tight then you toke uh!
Fingers red hot or cold degrees or the trees
This rap that I breathe I can make I believe
Anyone could make if 2 chains & Trini james did
Staying Humble nigga I ain't tryna change shit
But nobody knows where they might end up
Pour it up pack rappers roll it up High is fuck YEAH!!
They look then they judge but it don't really care nigga

[Verse 2]
These niggas don't know
Young black kid 22 getting euros
The fake friends follow
The struggle is real so I pop the moscato
No cup yeah im drinking from from the bottle
Groupies just wanna hit
But i just use the throttle
Knees bent no bed
Stupid brains ed ed
All the books this nigga never open
Stiill Metaphors inside my head like the whole roc nation
I'm looking to the future trying make it right
All the things that ever happen in life
Will I have two kids?? will I ever meet my wife??
But only lord knows if this shit would ever happen
Remember that they watching me while I'm in action
God of rap I'm never tired rappin no
God of everything knows what the future holds

[HOOK]

Man I wish I had that date down pack
Looking down from the sky while they wearing all black
I'mma Live yow heaven where you at?
A nigga gone & he never coming back
