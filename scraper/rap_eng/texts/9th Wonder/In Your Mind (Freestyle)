I never leave MCs intact
I spit like a dragon; Chinese, in fact
Aim the strongest bar at the weakest act
On your label
With the flow like Dark Gable
Unstable, this style is fatal
Made to incinerate, eviscreate, and disintegrate
I intimidate and humiliate
When I vociferate the rhymes
The style proliferates
By the formula f (x)
Hardcore like sex
Complex like mathematics
Flip words like acrobatics
Better skip the dramatics
I spit like automatics
Each word is a bullet
That I spit to the fullest
When it comes to emceeing, I just step to the pulpit
And deliver my sermon, Erick
Never generic
Lyrically, I'm esoteric and barbaric
Emphasis on 'bar'
You ain't worthy to spar
You got no guard
Plus, if you step, you'll only get scarred
As I compose this diagnosis
This flow is
The dopest, divide the style like meiosis
And conquer the beat like the Aztecs
Practice makes perfect when you spit flows this +Fantastic+
Like those +Four+ bars I just spit, with straight roughness
I do the beat justice, with lyrical toughness
On the mic, I come in +Nicer+ than +Greg+
Stepping up to my sector will get you sliced like an egg
