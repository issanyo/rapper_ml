[Verse 1: Profound]
Hey yo, live from the, live from the underground
Here to hear your rhythm and the crispy sound
It's the contrast warden and for coming in last
Quick to push a flow, leave my foot on the gas
I'm going to the crowds to escape the world
With a pen, paper pad, and a thick white girl
80's music bumpin' in my cheap headphones
They corny but the flow is something yall' ain't own
Who here to kick it with the masterminds?
Laid back chillin' sitting low, reclined
Laughing at you suckers tryna' be what your not
If it was up to me you rappers wouldn't be hot
Levi jacket with the moccasins
I see you suckers losing while we counting these wins
It's the contrast 1, come and step in my shoes
Talk big talk, I'm steady making a move

[Hook: Profound]
Who you know that's cool enough to kick it, huh? huh?
To kick it, huh? huh?
To kick it, huh? huh?
Who you know that's cool enough to kick it, huh? huh?
To kick it, huh? huh?
To kick it, huh? huh?

[Verse 2: Profound]
Lets take a ride out to outer space
Go as far to the moon, illuminate our face
Contrast me always playing it cool
Monotone voice and a mellow mood
Swagin' enough to get the upper class
When I get rich Imma' get yo (uh hu)
Weakness aside, I'm perfecting my strengths
Tracks that I find I continue to vent
If I'm with the crew, staring at the sky
The future's still bright when I close my eyes
Haters act shocked when they see we made it
Seems like when your famous you're all related
Same ones who hated will probbly' play this
Seems like I've been daydreaming a lot lately

[Hook: Profound]
Who you know that's cool enough to kick it, huh? huh?
To kick it, huh? huh?
To kick it, huh? huh?
Who you know that's cool enough to kick it, huh? huh?
To kick it, huh? huh?
To kick it, huh? huh?
