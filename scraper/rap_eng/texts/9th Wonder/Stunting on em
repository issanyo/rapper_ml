Verse 1
My spaceships landed(yuh)
Dreams stole my sleep like a bandit
Bodybags bang bang platinum,plastics
Rap attacking repping like a voice
In the streets mehn i'm just blabbing
Explosive darts to your heads(da da)
A couple of bodybags(dead niggas)
Ama take em to God,like

It all started all lonely nah they
All want a man
And i ain't giving em shit
Cuz i'm thugging nah

And getting this money
I got bodybags
And i've got money
I've got moneybags
