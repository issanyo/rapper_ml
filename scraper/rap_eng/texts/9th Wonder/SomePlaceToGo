[Verse 1:]

And maybe ease my mind for just a moment
Sometimes i wish that i could take the blunt
And just clone it
So maybe i could take this feeling
And try to cloak it
In the aroma, That got these poster boys choking
I hung myself on 2 chains
Because this world cold, Now I'm boasting
Possess this progress
So I'm looking past your congress
It's ironic, How you lack a congressional thought process
Slaves to the industry I'm beginning to see abolished
And maybe the youth will catch on, But i doubt it
Not to sound pessimistic
But all this petty wit has got me distanced
Facebook memes and Twitter feeds are all i witness
Picture the social suicide
Instagram that shit
I need a gram just to deal with all that shit

So now I'm wishing, that i could find
Some place to go, You know?

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Cass Hadley]

Both of my Eyes are open
But the truth is what i don't see
Is this all a fantasy? or Just another conspiracy?
(it's both)
And they wonder why we smoke trees
The girl I'm fucking right now counts her problems underneath her sleeve
Writes love on her arms
And breeds peace
I tried to dance with the devil but had two left feet
So when they arrest me
Tell them 'He's already locked up'
Trapped in my mind
Writing poetry with Pacs blood
Inhale like atheists
Better yet an eighth of it
Just trying to Escape the daily pain that waking is

But I'd rather be the fucker with the whole world mad at me
Than be the faggot that I'm not, another tragedy
