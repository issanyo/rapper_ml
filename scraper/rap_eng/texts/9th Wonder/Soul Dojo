Fear does not exist in this dojo does it?
No sensei!
Pain does not exist in this dojo does it?
No sensei!
Defeat does not exist in this dojo

Cuz if the soul is the essence of life
Man I gotta treat my body like a temple
I'mma flow through the dojo words on instrumental
It's special whether righteous or trife
School yourself in the essence of life
Cuz if the soul is the essence of life
Then man I gotta treat my body like a temple
I'mma flow through the dojo words on instrumental
Especial while the righteous are trife
School yourself in the essence of life

[Verse 1: Kaze]
It's hard to raise it up a level, now a days
I'm spending so much time dancing with the devil
I had to see some [?] so the Hydes could turn Jekyll
But I'm staying protected
Living life like a rebel so my death's expected
Still refuse to lose or be be controlled by society
Blackman, pigeon hold, Feds stay eyeing me
Struggle with your mental's until the world see with clarity
Choose music as my yellow brick road to prosperity
Truth for today's youth is rob, clap, steal, shoot
Anyway you do the math money be the evil
This shit is real and survival comes first
Street life will leave you locked up or dead in a hearse
So many rappers telling dramatizations to our nation
And hip hip stations is ran by corporate Caucasians
Devoid of the culture man, I gotta bust my gun to rap?
Yo, what part of the game is that?

[Hook: Kaze]

Cuz if the soul is the essence of life
Man I gotta treat my body like a temple

[Verse 2: Kaze]
I'm asking god what I'm here for
'Cause every breathe is like pain, how could I feel more?
I keep hustling and juggling these bills and rent
Turning water into wine
Making dollars out of fifteen cents
But still I will never sink
'Cause my skin is like a permanent ink
It's regulating how I walk, talk and think
So my plan is to start a fam and raise a son
And keep setting the paper fahrenheit's to 451
But still when I'm done
I'm repping NC number one
'Cause at first there'll be a lot of thugs and then there'll be none
Y'all the types to act bad on the microphone
It's just clones who probably act like Michael Jackson at home
People label me a hell raiser
Cuz my attitude is like a Portland Trail Blazer
Who want what?
Watch the world with my third eye and lay in the cut
And let experience teach to every head that I reach

[Hook: Kaze]
Cuz if the soul is the essence of life

Cuz if the soul is the essence of life
Man I gotta treat my body like a temple
I'mma flow through the dojo words on instrumental

School yourself in the essence of life
