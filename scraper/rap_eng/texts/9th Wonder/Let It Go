[Intro]
Woooo
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Woooo

[Verse 1: Steele & Tek]
I walk around town with the crown, I'm a king
Booth or stage on my square, like a fighter in a ring
Tyson was Price, I’m Mic Mayweather
These rappers is nice, I write way better
Pound for pound, lines of nines, round for round
Style profound, spark the loud, sound surround, (Wooooo)
How can I move the crowd?
First of all, no rats or snakes allowed!
The Larkin blaow, nobody body parts are found
Not near, not near nada talking foul, when gods around
Snatch ya heart outcha chest
Now that's a jack move
You cowards lackin' respect
And that’s a fact prove
Let stone's throw fam
Wrekonize you fuckin with some grown ass mans
Smif n Wessun the brand, other weapon in hand
Kill a jam, my condolence, like it's death in the fam (Woo)

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Ayo it's wreck time, show some respect when you address mine
Step wise, get guys a Columbian neck ties (Woo)
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Go against the camp, that's a no-no
This shit ain't for show bro, these killas is loco

[Verse 2: Tek & Steele]
9 milli, .40 with the drum attached
So many bosses, fuck is all the workers at?
Let it blow, shorty gonna let it go
Hit the spot, run up in it with the hammer cocked
Kill em all
You sure?
I said kill em all
Leave no witness
Fuck it I said kill em all
No fucks given, it's the gang
Heard you got it, so we comin' for them thangs
Fingers itchin’, nigga make a move
I got mines, young boy want a body too
I see you frontin’, stuntin' on the gram
Ping your location, comin’ for them yams
Purple hairs, no seeds in the baggie
Trailer load, Got it comin' in from Cali
Biggie Smizzie, 62 grizzies
A team of shooters, all my niggas litty, (Right, woooo)

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Ayo it's wreck time, show some respect when you address mine
Step wise, get guys a Columbian neck ties (Woo)
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Go against the camp, that's a no-no
This shit ain’t for show bro, these killas is loco
