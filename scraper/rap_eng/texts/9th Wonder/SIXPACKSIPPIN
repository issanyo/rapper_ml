[Verse 1]
Infinite the Cool like some Nestea, hefty
Six pack sippin' with my lefty, Lucy
Screws be trynna screw me
Groupies wanna group me with the boujie
Had a [?] with my [?], truely
We can't kick it, somethings missing, keep your kitten
Bitches ain't shit like they last commitment
Rock the boat, she be on the next shipment
Guess my cargo's couldn't carry a cargo
Plus he ain't really rockin' with no car, no
Drop the bitch like bar soap, trust me
It's better to be musty, now he a must-see
Pussy rappers can't touch me, they dental dams
Take it from the mental man, and tell the fam
Fuck bad bitches, bag to riches
Du-rags and snitches, get your wave up
Hit you with a taper, shape up
Lyrical exercise, see the signs, but free the line
Come up shorthanded, stranded
Castaway, laughed today, cry tomorrow
Fuck your sorrow, when you down in the bar
Here's my two cents, your bitch a nuisance
In that new sense, she was new since the days of bein' a crew wench
Stupid, cupid, flow hit 'em with lupus
[?], infinite, intricate, intimate, indigo
Parental advisory, yo, peep the irony
Suburbia mom despising me but on the DL, behind me
Wishin' they supply me with the beast milk for my fruit loops
Off the first track, knew she a true-true
Check a bitch like who's you? But who's who?
And put her on pause like Blue's Clues
