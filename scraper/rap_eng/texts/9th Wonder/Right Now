[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Yo
Normally spit ice cold, three-thousand [?] below
Opposite [?], niggas don't feel me doe
Back in it, two molars to kill 'em, I'm ill: cobra
I'm sittin' [?] shit [?] yo, it's so over
Blue Ivy Carter, Deshaun became a pop
Like daughter they say the flow of Hova is beautiful
I'm killer, my nigga, rigamortus like K. Dot
My Jeremy Lin flow, yo, I stepped in the game hot
They [?] to me, over on Blake Griffin
I ball so hard, couldn't find me [?] you niggas
Been awaitin' mine, witnessin' real proof
[?] been over like that too

We gon' do it right now (now, now)
We gon' do it right now (now, now)

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Yo
Saturday-Sunday flow, that's how the week end
Lines remind you of waitin' shoppin' for Jordan 10's
Anxious for my release, rap is the real deal
D'Angelo naked truth [?] drugs how it really feel
Gettin' 'em sky high, stuck in my flow still
Rushin' my patience gon' have me rushin' patients I kill
To E.R., more liquor for my homies, my nigga
[?] we catch ya attention like Aston
Martin's driven in places niggas can't afford them
[?] I represent [?] the acronym
[?] I represent [?] the acronym
[?] I represent [?] the acronym
[?] I represent (we gon' do it right now)
Yo, [?] I'm holdin' my weight
Don't worry 'bout niggas, flow'll take care of 'em: Drake
Lost in the party life, feeling eighteen again
Reason for wylin' tonight but give me another sin
Killin' these niggas off, exposin' they spines
Niggas backed [?] half of these niggas can't rhyme (yo)
Just speaking the truth, ain't no fuckin' with mine
Yo, [?] and right now is the time

[Pre-Chorus: Rapsody]
We do it (we do it, we do it)
We do it (we do it, we do it)
We do it (we do it, we do it)
We do it (we do it, we do it)

[Chorus: Rapsody & Samples]
(We gon' do it right now), [?], we did it right now
Right now (we gon' do it right now), right now
Right now (we gon' do it right now), right now
Right now (we gon' do it right now), right now
Right now (we gon' do it right now), [?]
