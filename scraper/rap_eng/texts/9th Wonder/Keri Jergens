I can see how bad you are but I'll stay to myself
And if it gets too bad I'll get a bottle of lotion
And take the pain away
I'll get a bottle of lotion, and take the pain away

I roll dolo. To hell with you, AND YOU, you broke ho. You got no dough, don't take a photo. Anti-YOLO, so fuck being a promo device for you to ride at night. If I do decide to slide I might write about you on the blog, but you gonna have to Log On like you Jamaican. Why you bitches hating? I told you I was dating and she started breaking up with me. As if she we was rolling  and I had to cop the dutch and weed. How hilariously us we be. Because I met you and got no trust for thee. So I'd go home to Jergens. At least I could love me, hate me and be certain. Perfect. Pull up the curtains, or pull them together. I'll be good-er forever with me

I can see how bad you are but I'll stay to myself
And if it gets too bad I'll get a bottle of lotion
And take the pain away
I'll get a bottle of lotion, and take the pain away

There were a couple of girls who younger who had my hunger inside their eyes. And that obviously meant when we made eye contact I would honestly try to slide. I was about 23, 22, 21, that's me being (i) Jordan, (ii) kinda funny and (iii) the One. GAME. Point game. This year I'm 24, which would make me Kobe, but I will not OD. But back to the youth. I would straight black in the booth, come out and they'd laugh and say "He's cute." And I would say "Back to the crib," like Chris. But your man can't do shit like this. I'm a little bit older, a little bit wiser. I'm spitting some fire, and you're on my shoulder. I don't want to go to jail! Get your diploma, and when you come over, it's over. Until then...

I can see how bad you are but I'll stay to myself

9th Wonder on the beat and it don't stop
Charles Hamilton the beat and I don't stop
Two niggas over there and they won't stop
So I won't jot because I'm so hot
Solar system, motherfucker, so go and rock
Pick a rock, I'm molten rock
Over hot, no need to jot so I stop with this beat go...
