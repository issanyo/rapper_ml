[Intro]
Ridin'
Tryna survive it
Liquor so dark (dark)
And the club so lit (lit)
And my mind so gone (gone)
And my soul so sick (sick)

[Chorus]
Went searching for myself
And I ain't find shit
Ah, shit
Why everywhere I go it turn into some shit!
Ridin'
She ridin' (where you goin’?!)
Went searching for myself
And I ain't find shit
Ah shit
Why everywhere I go it turn into some shit

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Dark clouds surround you everywhere you go
I know the type
You only attract violent, self esteem issue kinda types
Club wit your children, 5th of liquor and skittiwee
Try to run that game on me but baby you shit’n me
Same hemoglobin, family tree, I know you very well
We all got somebody in our family that we can't save from hell
Pressure, pain, memories of bad thangs you been through
Cried so many tears is surprising you ain't mildewed
Look at me
Ya can’t do it
You know that Imma gon’ see thru it
Running wit them funny folk
We know they won't see to ya
Loved ones gon ride wit ya
Don't turn your back on me
Truth hurt, I know it do but, please don't lie to me
Good or bad I'm here for ya, that's what you call family
The world going crazy, it's easy lose to lose your sanity
Looking for a way out, see you beefing wit des rah rahs
Searching for yourself, I see you nightly when you drive by
This nigga, that nigga, don't matter if they holla
You let em in, next thing you gotta another baby Dada
Circling, circling, riding,smoking, ya high too
Tryna find the voice that can tell you where to find you

[Chorus]
Went searching for myself
And I ain't find shit
Ah, shit
Why everywhere I go it turn into some shit!
Ridin'
She ridin' (where you goin’?!)
Went searching for myself
And I ain't find shit
Ah shit
Why everywhere I go it turn into some shit

[Verse 2: GQ]
Brain scattered like showers, I’m losing power
My mind is starting to fuck wit me
Dealing wit lots of feelings, depression becoming publicly
Luckily Im in line, I’ll be damn if a nigga cuttin’ me
Climb a mountain for mo’
No safety, or rush for me
Take a shuttle to space
Space is never enough for me
Peddlin’ by the moon they assuming someone abducted me
Judging me by the day, Aliens criticizing
Know why you hate to watch ‘cuz my timing is hypnotizing
They tell me, shoot for the stars
May need to cop me a rifle
Changing like choir boy on that day he forgot his bible
Never try to adjust you just fuckin’ try to complain
And I try to do not like you, in my view we ain't the same
Monthly collectin’ mo’ the feelin’ how Im vibin’
Everything for the ones I love got my mind ridin’
Turbulence, hopefully my wings hold
Good wishes and prayers we gon need those

[Interlude: Volume]

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
8:07 PM on the dot
Party round the way if you tryna catch a ride
Don't matter what you wear ain't no code for da night
Just hurry up tho, we all tryna slide
Girls in free, boys pay the 5
My Back seat full, everybody let’s ride
Turn the volume way up high yo, that's jam she spit that “ahhh”
If a cop knock everybody shhh drop
Hide the liquor, we don't wanna get popped
Mr officer is there a problem?
This was a just a small get together
I understand we can help you solve it
No problem, we’ll turn down the volume
No, problem, we’ll turn down the volume
No, problem, we’ll turn down the volume
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, up
