[Intro]
Yeah
From the heart you know

[Verse 1: GQ]
See this here story take place not far from here
About a kid named Kevin who was headed down the right path
No trouble, never messin up
Both parents in his life, grades always kept them up
Still around the drama though, city had a lot to show
Neighborhood place where only cops would go
Told himself one day I’mma make it out, far away from all of this
Now he thinking in the car and shit
Drivin down the highway, music up, blowin out the Hemmy
That’s when he got a call from his main man Benny
See Benny had a gang plan, waitin for them to get paid
Mastermind, tight mind, sharper than a sick fade
So Kevin we could snatch paper like ripped page
My homie started rockin and he was clockin in 6 days
So Kevin mind’s in a mixed stage
Funny feeling in his stomach, stickin like a switch blade
Not sure of what he heard
But Kevin still took Benny’s word
Cuz he know him since the 5th grade
Couple minutes later call came to him and he
He understood it all but still couldn’t comprehend it
Now Kevin fightin overthinkin while he drivin home
His mind gone so his heart what he relying on
Looking out fo mo, only thing his eyes on
Wanna turn bad to good but don’t know if it’s right or wrong
Months went by, everything running smooth
True enough, Benny’s plan, gotta make your moves
So now Kevin at an alltime high
His attitude changed, you could see it in his eyes
Little pocket change turned out to be the answer
Trust nobody, on his toes like a dancer
Leavin school one day, Kevin went Bonanza
When he came home and found out his mom had cancer
What makes it worse, lately hearin pops been trippin
Job laid him off a month ago, income slippin
Man this is nothing that Kevin would’ve predicted
Good kid caught up in a world so wicked
He just needed better days, hard to enjoy em
Bullshit, bad luck, he couldn’t avoid em
Him and Benny workin on but nobody employed em
Money and whatever came with it got a poison
Opposite of what he is now what he lusts
Fell in love with greed, more ain’t even enough
The money and attention
Kevin kid and was getting on the nerves of Benny slowly
But he ain’t show it to his homie
But now they friendship was crumbling, Styrofoam
Both of they minds gon heart what they relying on
Tryna get some mo', only thing they eyes on
Wanna turn bad to good but don’t know if it’s right or wrong
Starin at life, something only few would see
Kevin and Benny ain’t as cool as they used to be
I guess jealousy and envy just came between em
We all look at things different but for a reason
It looked good from a distance, hypnotizing
But when he finally did it be a bit surprising
Want it but I don’t know if I’m made for it
Forbidden fruit, we all crave for it
Yeah
