[Intro]
Ladies and Gentlemen, you're now tuned in to the one and only
S-K-Y-Z-O-O and the one and only, 9th Wonder
Figured I'd put something together real quick
With my man Ninth Wonderful Tunes, that's what I call him
Yeah, BK, You already know what it is
Custom made HOJ, figured we'd save a couple lives
It started like this

[Verse 1]
I sat back and watched all of the bullshit
Wonderin' if it was ever gonna back track
Saw the industry spaz and do a full flip
Then I jumped like naw, I can't have that
So I thought, before I start my debut
I'd take a couple days and get lifted
Put something together to start a break thru
A hit em light, cuz this is only the quick shit
I went in the stash, found all the 9th Wonder beat tapes I had
And put them on blast
I know 9th, I'm good friends with son
These are not off of the net, I ain't fish for none
These were handed to me directly from Mr. Douthit
And Mr. Taylor's gonna put a swag around it
So me and 9th invite y'all to fuck with your neighbors
Right next door, bare witness to the greatest

[Hook]
Yeah bare witness to what y'all need
And what y'all want, long time coming
So when this comes on, have no fear
Pop the state of the game, you see the way we bang
You hear it

[Interlude]
So real quick just to break it down before we go any further
This is called Cloud 9: The 3 Day High
Cuz it took three days to put this together
Cuz great minds think alike, so when you think alike
It's easy to get it going
Motherfuckers is acting like the don't understand, like
They don't smell what's cookin' in here
But on the real though

[Verse 2]
It's right up under there nose but they ain't sniffin' it
They copping out like there allergies is kickin' in
But you can front like you still stuffy
But dude, after this EP you will love me
Cuz lyrically I'm a God
And beat-wise 9th is thunder, and his drums is giving you SARS
I know, so we invite y'all to fuck with your neighbors
Right next door bare witness to the greatest

[Hook]
Yeah bare witness to what y'all need
And what y'all want, long time coming
So when this comes on, have no fear
Pop the state of the game, you see the way we bang
You hear it
