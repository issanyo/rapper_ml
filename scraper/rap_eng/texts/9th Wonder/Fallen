[Verse One]
My sister can't afford me and there ain't no other way
I need to find a place to stay or make my pennies in a harder way
I'm on 19, turnin' 20 in months
With all that stress on my chest, I need to puff on some blunts
Now I'm on the job hunt to put the food on my plate
I gotta get this APC but all I G.E.T. is section 8
Checks from unemployment with assistance from the public
The way I'm falling down, it's like my life is almost done with
The way my confidence died, it kinda makes me teary eyed
The easy life I was denied, now I'm breaking down inside
Nowhere to hide, but my life I gotta run
With all these problems on my shoulders and they weigh out to a ton
Yeah I used to dream, now I'm runnin' from a nightmare
I used to have goals but now it seems like it was never there
No one's aware of my silent cry for help
They tend to walk on by and let it ride and go all out for delf
I was put here, now I'm gonna leave here
Didn't ask for struggle and I didn't ask to be here
And my situation? Some people thinkin' suicide I'm contemplating
It's the time that I'm wasting
On the run with devil's chasin'

[Verse Two]
I'm slowly slipping through the cracks of this society
They said I'm gonna make it now I'm thinkin' that they lied to me
I'm in the race I never win cause in this world there ain't no finish line
Cause there's only time to shine then your life turns to a flat line
For me to get mine, is like a never ending story
Cause I'll never start to get it so there would be nothing for me
Got nothing but experience upon my resume
But I never understood why I never got a decent pay
I bust my ass, I even went away for class
For all the A to Z's I had in life, one on one I couldn't pass
I guzzle down the Crooked Eye, inhale the lah
Before I get my wings and fly, I'm gonna cut me out a piece of pie
All I have is crumbs, I wanna multiply my sums
By the time my day will come I might be shaking hands with God's son
My life is in the hole and I keep on falling
Deeper in a ditch, I cry for help, nobody hears me calling
It's a cold cold world, I wasn't born with a coat
All I ever had was hope and all them rhymes that I wrote
So through the walks in my life I'm going out for a stroll
To put it simple and plain, it's just my life in the hole
