[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Black Dynamite, We throw China White
A mother fucking nightmare to a naivete
Licensed to kill, get the fuck from around me
Jim Brown mustache, fro like Roundtree
Surround Sound, My eight track is Delfonic
Layed back like a nigga just inhaled chronic
My arms washed, fresh Vines
Never dim in the booth, I make fresh rhymes
Black Power, Smack Cowards
Time to get ill, Give me a half an hour
Above the law, no city cop
Too cool for that shit, Peep the Diddy Bop
Bullhorn and Cream Corn, The team's strong
Square peg, I flair leg, my jeans on
Who killed my brother? (You?)
I think you did it (Uhhuhh)
I don't kick ass, I put my ankle in it (P!)

[Verse 2: Buckshot]
Ugh, Shots will blind ya sight
I'm that kind you'll like
In these streets, otherwise known as Black Dy-no-mite
Tick tick tick tick boom, When I come through the room
Dirty Harry .44 Mag in my hand, Come feel this soon
Who you think you are? I'mma ghetto superstar
And I got chicks on the strip wishing they knew my car
Cocaine, Mace, and Speed
Heroin, Dope, and Weed
When I come through everybody duck, why? They know it's me
Shotgun blast go off, Cops don't pass that off
In my hood everybody ball, but ain't no basketball
We just sit and pray, Dynamite come our way
Set that they, show off, How? We don't play
Roundhouse and kicks, Fists pile through lips
Listen, Ain't gotta good reason I'm just down to flip
