I feel like I sold out. No doubt. All because me and some different chick go out. If the chick is a 6, there’s no doubt that my dick been in the bitch’s whole mouth. So why I gotta act like I’m new now? I’m sick of acting like I’m Hov, now… but in my old style, that was what I’d do. And I ain’t even rappin’ in the booth, so half of this is true. The other half of it is a lie. I been fitting my dick inside of a “fitted” little bride. She’s fitted because I’ve been inside, many o’ times. I’m still pissed as I rhyme. I wish I could go back to my Strike Drum flow. Lightning flow. Cats don’t write. I know. But I gotta excite the most high when I go higher than most, just to provide you with quotes

Maybe it’s destiny
[I don’t know what it is, all I know is I just wanna flow from the wig]
Maybe it’s destiny
[If you know what it is, then help me out with a healthy shout]
Baby, don’t question me
[Am I blocking me? Are you watching you? Are you watching me?]
Maybe it’s destiny
[That’s all I gotta say]
Maybe it’s destiny
[So let me rock away]

I’m bigger than Rita. But yet, I made a hit with Rita. I guess the bitch is now a diva. I never got to hit it, either. And if I did hit it, the chick would need a breather. I need her deeper because she’s gotta exist to provide the hit with the shit that it might miss if she did NOT exist. But what if I died? That’s the bottom line that I ride with. But, I can’t talk about SEGA either. And I ain’t tryna play with the people, or lay with a diva. God damn. My whole nonsense is becoming nonsense as I give it. And it’s not nonsense. I just got 9 as a sense. And they can sense something’s up. But, since when does Charles Hamilton give a fuck?
