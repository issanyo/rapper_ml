[Verse]
One Life
Every single day I think about this rap shit
And everything I say consider it as practice
Everytime I write a song I'm tryna make a classic
Cause I put too much work in to go backwards
I'm searching for a purpose let's see who finds it fastest
This track remind of me of stashing the re-up in the mattress
Looked up to paid hustlas invading taxes
‘Til the trap got raided and niggas faded to blackness, ahh
What a shame, our role models all the same
Pitching coke bottles, in the end it's all game
Grew up pitching baseballs and when he came of age
Dreams withered, but got drafted to second stage (major league)
Dropped out of school hit the block first
Everyday the pack moving like clockwork
Hit the bodega ask ahk for the frontos
Now he back at it, crack addicts coming pronto
Got a bad habit counting money wit my eyes closed
This life I chose got me feeling like a honcho
Feeling all colossal, f around and dive off the top ropes
You want beef, I’m cheffin up the pot roast
Now-a-days I'm feeling real alone
But it's okay the sour blazed and now that feelings gone
I don't want no hour pay, I need a million strong
So I could go and pave the way to put my niggas on
And I could say a million words the way the picture's drawn
Gotta get it off my chest so imma pick a pawn
I told her I ain't going home until the liquor gone
She was too slim had to go and get a thicker jawn
It's one life for niggas that ain't familiar
Do ya thang don't hang from my genitalia
Unless you bad ting from Venezuela
I was born to win, I never had to deal wit failure
Don't ask me for advice, cause I ain’t got nothing to tell yea
Acting like they want it but they fronting they ain't real yea
Y’all niggas don't feel me paralyzed in a wheelchair
These niggas tried to sabotage me, but I'm still here
These niggas tried to sabotage me, but I'm still here
These niggas tried to sabotage me, but I'm still here
These niggas tried to sabotage me, but I'm still here
Nigga, I’m still here, nigga, I’m still here
