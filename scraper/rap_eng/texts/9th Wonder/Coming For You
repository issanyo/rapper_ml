[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Hook]
I am one of the most consistent, respected in the business
My name make 'em shiver when you whisper it
I'm sleeped on
Times said it's my time and all the G's know
From the east to the west coast, Nas said I had a blessed flow
I'm sleeped on
Got it mixed like pico, barge in like Chico
Choke your chief now I'm the leader of all your people
I'm sleeped on
Give peace though, you think a piece of my teeth
As I tear through and feed your ego
Unhappy as CeeLo, for real

[Verse 1]
Cut the rules off
The new rules, ain't no rules, I'm the new law
These the keys to all the real bars
First you gotta learn control to play the game like P-4
This ain't Fifa, or Brazil real
Silly mind said beat it him or hers, no drill
But a tool I still use so often
It's like the hammer to put the nail in the coffin
No discrimination, even whites say awesome
With your Rick Ross need a doctor lookin' like Boston
No rules against flossin' I shine through the winters and monsoons
The fearful never know what I'm gon' do
Call it Luol Deng in here, that's a nine heat
A beast, a flower, bringin' slow singin' like 9 beats
That's a metaphor, I mean simile, but understand we ain't similar
I keep the letter for, it's never offensive
It's critical thinking why I feel so intensive
I could do it all night boy, never is endless
Keep my ear to the streets like rims is
Yea, uh, invincible like 4 arms
A slam dunk, it's a message to the forearms
You been forewarned, I'm a beast, uh
I keep J's like 41's on my feet son
You need 4 wands, magic in the forum
Or just pass it to and got him like oh I'm
So sick and this flow type ridiculous
I got 'em singin' like

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't a choir but get acquired
Dress for success and defeat it in my attire
Stay lifted, I'm terrific kid like 4th graders
I want a love like Ruby and the mayor, yea
Every day out the bed rise, from Snow Hill to Bed-Stuy
L.A. and worldwide, I stay fly like bow-ties
What up Carlie, that's the hustle, hype don't mean a thing
You can ask Phillip and Russell
Third quarter I'm back
It's a fact, y'all in trouble, Seahawks cold comin' bruh
I'm a cold woman, bruh, I'm a cold woman
Yea, I been wiggin' and now it's Salt Lakes
You know a lotta sadness and a lotta hate
I got a better catalogue than the one with the H
Rapsody, easy exercise y'all bent outta shape
Lyrical flex on, welcome back the faculty
The ruler's back, ain't too many comin' after me

[Hook]
