[Verse 1: Geez Francisco]

Still the same nigga from grade school with the naps
Only difference that I'm older, I find it harder to laugh
Sicker since of humor spit tumors when I rap
I'm a puma strike and attack
On the loose, hide in the back
I mastered ether Hawaiian shirts and a beater
And will I wear it open? Depends if I need some cheetah
If it's buttoned up, well just know I came with the heater
I don't trust a damn soul, I would never leave it to beaver
A couple grams away from the face of your lord and savior
Or will I burn in hell for my fornicational capers
Never cheated bitches but death is a different mistress
I'm bout 80 ounces deep, 4 percocets to the liver
Living close to the edge cliched life of a nigga
So happy with triggers these bazooka Joe rappers
Get closed caskets, nothing left from the chrome matic
I'm a cold bastard, Cryogenesis I got the flows mastered
And what I hold in my palm opened Pandoras box
Trained since a younging I had to master the Cobra Kai
Eyes on golden eye, 007 to blow ya mind
When the blunt lit you consider him super saiyan
The mayhem I ensue on the microphone is amazing
Like the scent of fresh puss after showers you stick your face in
Face it no mere man could ever match my greatness
My dirty vans complimented by my weed as a fragrance
A fucking stoner honestly I feel like that's what's best for me
Never leaning nigga don't need no fucking Promethazine
And slipping? Would never let these niggas get the best of me
Eat a bowl of life while I contemplate on my destiny
And steak for dinner, the beef well done and it's tender
Jack Daniels sauce on it with a side of the spinach
It was free of charge, my light bright bitch giving her D and all
And DNA she sucking and fucking it ain't a no Q and A
And the puss? Nigga no questions I left it DOA
Spitting TNT with a trace of NWA

[Verse 2: Geez Francisco]

I said I smoked about a half of the herb
In a broken ass hoopdie it was parked on curb
A ghetto nigga but his aura like he not from this earth
Shit I ain't innocent I witnessed niggas pack up a bird
I'm more intuitive, I'm tryna get in tuned with the earth
Tongue on mother natures puss, I'm tryna bore me some fruit
Reap the benefits, hopping in and out of the benz and shit
Ducking sentences, but administered it with the penmanship nigga
Don't confuse me with terrorist, Talibans or apprentices
More or less I'm the nemesis
Walter White with the chemist shit
Only difference I'm in this shit for the hunnit percentages
Nothing less than immaculate, smell the weed through the packages
Rappers get hadoken blast disappear like magic tricks
Bare hand on fire I told you I could master it
