[Intro: Phonte]
They ask me what I think about the competition
And I say “No, I couldn’t care less about the team strugglin'
I wanna kiss you”

New Tigallo, New Tigallo, New Tigallo

[Verse 1: Phonte]
Tigallo and 9th Wonder, maybe
We got yo girl undulating
To the rhythm of the drum
Wet t-shirt lookin’ like a vacation
Take it off like Monday, baby
And there will be no underrating
So please hold your applause
Let it bump a little up in your cars
They say that boy’s back
Nigga, this is blackboard rap
You can gon’ chalk it up to a loss
And if you got a problem with it, walk it up to the boss
And get your card pulled like pitty pat
Body a verse and put it in a pine box
You niggas can get a fuckin’ shine box, Billy Batts

[Hook: Phonte]
And really that’s all my time, this is the last chapter
You x and y, we off the damn axis
Intricate, me and 9th, two of God’s instruments
And when we get together you can call it band practice

[Verse 2: Median]
Men of action, they hustle bass ackwards
Penny for your thoughts kid, miss me with that rappin’
Sho Nuff, I am like the master
See the glow what, grown up, I am that then
I am passion, two parts magic
Sprinkle in authentic, simmer with a little madness
Got a vendetta for the magistrate
Catch you in the world plain clothes, ain’t no tellin’ what’ll happen
That would be entrapment
Please, the audacity and casualty of crassness
I am absent minded for I am past it
Fry a fish much bigger for the inquisitive Jurassic
Picture Moby Dick, hold a flick, don’t miss it
May sank your ship, Ahab iddish
You need Arab benjamins when payin’ close attention to the mentionings
I too have brought an instrument for I’ve always known that they were listenin’
