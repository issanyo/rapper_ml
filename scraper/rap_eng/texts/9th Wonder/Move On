[Intro]
Sweetheart, I’ve been tryin' so hard to get over you
Just simply can’t
Cause the love we shared through the years
Meant so much to me
All I’m lookin' for is just a serious relationship
Someone I can hold all my life
Why don’t you give me that commitment?

[Hook: JaVonté]
How do I fill the bridge between us
When your distance seems so far?
How do we get to the future
If we can’t get past where we are?
Baby can we move on?
Can we move on?
Cause I’ve got so much love to give, I’ve got so much love to give
Can we move on?
Can we move on?
I’ve got so much love to give, I’ve got so much love to give
Baby

[Verse 1]
Tell me how we get our thing back
Before they go and try to get my ring back
Girl I said a lot of things I didn’t mean
Out of tryna ‘member where my team’s at
It’s you, but I feel like we losin’
Said we’d grow together but we ain’t, we’re just movin’
Different directions, here goes the questions
I think we on the right road just lookin’ for the exit
Sometimes I wish we could rewind
And go back how we used to be
See we had something special girl
It was me for you and it was you for me

[Bridge]
But if we wanna work it out
Then let’s get rid of all the doubts
We had a gang of problems, can we resolve ‘em?
Cause that’s what love is all about

[Hook]
How do I fill the bridge between us
When your distance seems so far?
How do we get to the future
If we can’t get past where we are?
Baby can we move on?
Can we move on?
Cause I’ve got so much love to give, I’ve got so much love to give
Can we move on?
Can we move on?
I’ve got so much love to give, I’ve got so much love to give
Baby

[Verse 2]
I’m tryna figure out just how to
Get to the future but now you
Goin’ back and forth like you do
Playin’ little games, testin’ me, tryna feel the truth
And you ain’t even gotta do that
Look me in my eyes, you can see that I’m past that
Fussin’ and fightin’, cussin’ on the phone
If I can’t be with you then I’d rather be alone
I feel the same way that you do
But I’m so scared to trust you

[Bridge]
But if you wanna work it out
Then let’s get rid of all the doubts
We had a gang of problems, can we resolve ‘em?
Cause that’s what love is all about

[Hook]
How do I fill the bridge between us
When your distance seems so far?
How do we get to the future
If we can’t get past where we are?
Baby can we move on?
Can we move on?
Cause I’ve got so much love to give, I’ve got so much love to give
Can we move on?
Can we move on?
I’ve got so much love to give, I’ve got so much love to give
Baby
