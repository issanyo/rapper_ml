[Verse 1]
You can laugh now
But I guarantee you cry later
When you see me later
And I'm doing much greater
I got the hunger so success seem like the sweetest flavor
They say its all love
But as I read between the lines I can see in bold letters
They just wanna favor
Aye do me a favor
Keep ya' favors
Born Without Greatness
Got sent straight to the minors
But look homie we major
Never tripping I adapt to anything Naughty By Nature
My only focus is making music
And stacking paper
So I ain't studing you hater
They say they got it
But they coming up short like a Pacer
So keep dreaming bout winning
Better yet just say a prayer
Better yet just say a prayer boi

[Hook]
You can laugh now
But I bet you cry x2
When you see me later
And I'm doing much greater x2

[Bridge]
Laugh now x2
I bet you cry later
Laugh now x2
I bet you cry later

[Verse 2]
Now they like
Who is that? Who is that doe?
Been flipping rhymes
Always been ahead of my time
Since I was nine
Had dreams of being top of the line
But instead they pushed me back of the line
Now I'm top line
And that's just bottom line
Nothing changed
I'm the same from back when you was dissing
Now I'm who you missing whenever you reminiscing
You didn't listen when I told you to listen
But now I'm who they bumping so you gotta listen
Now I'm up in yo' speakers
Now rappers want features
Now women are mostly the a-ttention seekers
I guess that's results when you constantly make heaters
She said I'll be nothing so I told my teacher

[Hook]
