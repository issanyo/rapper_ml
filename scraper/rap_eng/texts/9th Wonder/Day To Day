[Verse One: Spectac]
Ayo this whole game is cut throat
Literally they cutting out votes
While telling poor folks there's still no hope
But as long as there's dope in the game
Poor folks will be waiting for change
Shit still stays the same
And we ain't really mad 'bout life just aggravated by this fight
Our Stealth Bombers still can't fly right
That billion dollars we spent could've been some poor man's rent
We wrote him off a product of the environment
And jobs ain't hiring
1/3 is firing
And those that got jobs they thinking 'bout retiring
New York State of Mind, crime, police and firemen
Since 9/11 so many of them dying
Population multiplying
No food to feed 'em
Where's the sad love songs to sing when you need 'em?
And little Billy across the ocean, hoping and wishing
We send him more food instead we send him more missiles
It's so redundant
New Keds they so abundant
The Hiroshima bomb when it dropped, did we learn from it?
It turns my stomach all the games that we play
Everything we do and say still we do it day to day

[Hook: L.E.G.A.C.Y.]
From day to day, ain't nothing to play with
No jokes, no games kid
For years we been doing the same from day to day
Stuck in this rat race no room for last place
For years we been doing the same from day to day
Ain't nothing to play with
No jokes, no games kid
For years we been doing the same from day to day
Stuck in this rat race no room for last place
For years we been doing the same

[Verse Two: Spectac]
Still deaf dumb and blind, yelling "No child was left behind"
Signs of the times, I gotta wonder if we out our minds
White kids skipping school pumping needles
30 years ago they pump The Beatles
Remember black kids, caught the holy ghost?
Now they catch bullets like "Holy smokes"
I need to find a method like Hall & Oats
And more to love is not the answer
I heard they got a cure for cancer
But they won't tell us cause the profit's handsome
And when I try and think, better days, better ways
Conversate with secretary Paige about this outrage
Teachers being underpaid, minorities is catching AIDS
Most of them dropping out of school at an early age
But someday I hope teach 'em all to think wisely
So they don't be the one that gets cloned next Friday
Be a nigga with the same body, same facial features
Mind of a outer space creature
It's hard to meet your maker
When you're making yourself
Ain't this government something else?
I send a heartfelt shout out to my people's who
Learn tricknowledgy, still rock Wallabys, speak like they royalty
Educated thug from the corn field of S.C
I lounge where the vest be cause sad times depress me
Spectac and Justus League
They're governors of the Carolinas
Here's a word from your sponsor
Listen to the southern spit
L.E.G.A.C.Y. speak politic, day to day shit, that's it

[Hook]

[Verse Three: L.E.G.A.C.Y.]
The country evil
City filled with sick people
The older generation watches the new one
Fold to temptation, there's leaders and there's followers
Misled F.E.D.s that follow us
On the lay low
Surveillance equipment in Winnebagos
Open your front door, move when I say so
Ash to ash, corpse to corpse in Waco
Towards the end of time, as the warning signs
Are amongst us, it's just us
No peace
Stray bullets with no leash
Two teams, letting the shots go
Remember the madness in Colorado
No hope is worthless
Bullet holes in churches
Loan sharks with no heart
Drug addicts with plush habits
Detectives stay after murder leads
Women unpretty, getting plastic surgery
Barbie dreams, for silicone breast pay the price
We take it day to day right?
Analyze why and how it flies by
No blinking, all alone thinking
It's crazy, with my head down
They sell babies on the web now

[Hook]
