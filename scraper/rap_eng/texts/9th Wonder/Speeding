Early in the morning, I'm sliding on the 40 West flooring
Trying to get this money like endorsements
As soon as I can I'll start soaring
As of lately, my whole life's transforming
Used to have dreams nowadays I be touching 'em
Used to not have haters, nowadays I'm loving 'em
Carolina grilling, what a nice feeling
Brainstorming in the crib with the high ceilings
Life's good but you know I'm trying to buy villas
I don't even want to talk, I'll let 9th kill 'em
We record it then we store it in a time cap
So later you can go and see where my mind's at
Got my lawyer saying "dawg, you should sign that"
S.T. suit on, I recline back

I'm speeding, on the freeway passing trees
I'm after M's, I'm after B's, I'm after T's

I had the killer inside me, ain't no running from that
So I'm on the freeway with a drum in the back
Bass blowing the brains out, way off the map
Thinking if I get through this then you know it's a wrap
You know I'm gon' ride and that's nothing but facts
Gave my little bro game now he's running it back
Tribe migrating, soon to cover the map
They say the world is yours so we coming for that
Back when I ain't really have a lot
I was in a mind prison, pray the madness stops
With the world closing in, I let ashes drop
And catch that on the net while I'm adding knots
I'm trying to ball, I don't pass the rock
But I play the nice guy with the baddest thoughts
In an underground lair getting cabbage chopped
Or in a tower overlooking as the masses flock
