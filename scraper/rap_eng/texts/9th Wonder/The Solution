[Verse 1]
They call me Bruce Wayne Buck, Batman BDI
You can’t fuck with that man BDI
Psychotic when he get really high
I got it -- don’t I sound really fly?
Every lady in the spot agree
If it ain’t Buckshot, it’s me, K.B
Same person in the Benz with the curtain
And the chauffeur saying, Buck, turn right?
I’m like, for certain
It was real hard getting this far
But I got this label, this house, this money, this car
Can you say this, pa?
I think not; I think of how I feel, I think Pac
Me Against the World, shed so many tears
Writing letters, saying dear mama, can you really hear
Where I’m coming from; that’s the bottom line
And the goal is to hit the top and not waste time
Like tick tock, when the clock hit one
Y’all niggas is done
Buckshot’s it, you should stop

[Verse 2]
Stick a fork in ‘em
No disrespect to the rest, but Buckshot got New York in him
Little guy, blue denim
Not a snake, but the words that I use is like true venom
All in ‘em, all women
Recognize that the way that I ball is what you call tennis
Back and forth; who loves college, Asher Roth?
Me, I’m from the university they call raw
Kill ‘em all, reservoir dogs on the hounds’ll
Sniff out anybody who snitch out who’s around
Whose town? Cause from this point it’s all Buck
And, um, everybody down know what’s up
Major moves, make your moves
Buckshot, 9th Wonder on the spot
Never play by the rules like
Tock, tick, when the clock hit one
Y’all niggas is done
Buckshot’s it, you need to stop

[Verse 3]
It don’t matter, the Porsche or the Spider
Or me in the BM, pulling a all-nighter
It’s all right cause
My pockets ain’t seen a gap in a while
All you see is the gap or a crack when I smile but
It’s okay cause I still get ladies anyway
She thinking she bright but she shady anyway
We don’t give a fuck, do we? Nah
Smoke when I school dudes, Cooley High
Truly fly
Chicks get jealous, man
They used to listen before, but now I tell em, nah
Step aside, let the boss get past
You a trick; why, nigga? Cause you floss from Mass
I’m like, damn, you worked so hard just to give it up
She chilling in your car cause she give it up
What a life. I’m a witness
Enough to tell niggas, mind your business
You need to stop

[Outro]
Stop and listen, listen and stop
Number one album, 9th Wonder, Buckshot
This is what we do, I salute shit
Comes every day, I pollute shit
