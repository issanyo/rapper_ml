To my man Rick
Routines we used to kick
Every time you used to battle me
You told me I should quit
But nah kid, I stayed on that obnoxious
Fake shit, mob shit
You told me it was toxic
I lost it, but then you got it right back
You remember those fly chicks we used to mack
And those stacks
You used to try to jack
But somehow I always stayed away from all that
But yo this was round the time
When everything was wack
My Dad was telling me I had to pack
My shit into the UHAUL
And then its like the mood all just changed up
It's like we never came up
In the same place
You choose a mandate to make paps
While I read and studies lessons
You started counting mad bank and collecting
Never stressing the herbal was your essence
I hadn't seen or heard from you in 5 years
And in my life I'm trying to keep my mind clear
That's why I cried tears of joy
When I moved from the rank of unemployed
And now I stand poised as the artist
But memories could be the hardest
Like just last night
I kinda had to catch fright
They locked you up
And caught you with the fucking black light
And as I ponder
How two lives could so diverge
I put it on the mic
So as to give it words

[BMAN]
Welcome World!
Welcome all you boys and girls, girls especially
This is to thee cause there's no better muse for a melody
Than to see your eyes light up
Singing too you at my bedside
With a manner that they don't teach in medical school
Cause it'd be violating privacy rules
I want to cure you of all your ills
Want to make your life forever pleasure
So we can sit back and chill
But I can't cause I'm a weak man
And by that I mean I'm a man
So my weakness was planned by a higher power
I suppose that like a flower blooms
I assume I'm working towards a moment
That justifies this pending doom
I'm thinking now I'm drinking now I'm drunk
Smell like a skunk
In lust
Cause my pheremones have their own little home
Where they come and go out of my control
Pulsating from my soul
And right now the signals a direct hit
Trying to activate your two leg drive on that stick shift
First we bolt at a high speed
A little nervousness, a little hungry greed
Then we gotta slow it all down on occasion
To enjoy the signts and the sounds
That we miss in our racing
But time is a-wasting so we can't dilly dally all day
In child's play
Hit the full throttle as we head to the pinacle
And for that instant life is a miracle
