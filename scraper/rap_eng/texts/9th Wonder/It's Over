[Verse 1]
What up to Finn the human
What up to Jake the dog
What up to my ex, I hate it when you call
When I said goodbye, you must have thought that I was kidding
I was so serious, I wasn’t bullshitting
Did I forget to mention, there is no take backs
But now you see me happy, I know you hate that
You could be happy for me, that would be sort of strange
But hey, yay for you, I’m glad you changed
I’m sure someone else will find it real appealing
But in my life story, you chose to play the villain
No hard feelings, I wish you much success
I wish we could be friends but you’re a fucking mess
And I don’t need the stress, all I need is closure
And maybe I’ll evolve, but that’s when I get older
But now it's over, I told you to kick rocks
And keep your thirsty ass outta my inbox

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
This is the last time, it's over friends
Never been done before, never done again
Y'all already know how much fun it's been
So party on and we catch you on the other end
This one's for you
So party on and we catch you on the other end
Word up to Rapsody, word up to Ab-Soul
You ain't on Paid Dues? so I'm an asshole
I really wish I could put everybody on, kid
You don't like it, motherfucker get your own shit
That's what I did, and it worked for me
And now we're working on our eighth anniversary
So do you know what today is
It's the day you get up off your ass and make yourself famous
I don't owe you nothing, why you got your hand out
Why would I put food in a grown man's mouth
Ain't my fault your career didn't pan out
When I ignore you then you wanna go the Stan route
When your family outnumbers your fans
And you been trying, giving all that you can
It might be time for your ass to change plans
Homie, it's over you just don't understand that it's over

[Refrain]
This is the last time, it's over friends
Never been done before, never done again
Y'all already know how much fun it's been
So party on and we catch you on the other end
So party on and we catch you on the other end
What up to The Beatles, what up to New Edition
The true greatest groups ever, look people listen
And if you listening, if you tuned in
It's been an epic saga, a tale of two friends
Two men with a passion for their craft
Met at North Carolina and they started on this path
They had some laughs, made a lot of cash
They would fight a little bit but they would put it in the past
As time passed, they became brothers
And they never let the game make em turn against each other
One did beats, one did rhymes and
Once it was complete, then they knew that it was time
They say that all good things must come to the end
The Wire, The Sopranos, Seinfeld, and Friends
That's all folks, that's all that she wrote
It's over and it's finished, we gonna end it on a good note
