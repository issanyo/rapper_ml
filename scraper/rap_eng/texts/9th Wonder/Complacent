[Problem:]
Well problems the issue with beneficial judicial bars
No metaphor could ever explain this mental sores
Holes in the head, the critics players just the molly does
Nah it's that the devil, high as treble, riding in my truck
Staring at the driver side, hand rising up her thigh
Life's a bitch and a stitch that ho tell like the travel lodge
Dumb niggas try to change they life, for the better
So I'd rather the pull card again, but I'm too hot to sweat on these days

I get high,then I daze for days on end
Hope my son don't admire the stage that I'm in
But baby boy I'm on fire in the place that I'm fit
To take it, might make me complacent
Uh, shit changed and I need to face it
Finally realizing that Problems no longer chasing
Move real far so my envious rate is raising
Got money now, so any heart I break I replace it with ease

Damn shit cold, when you come from where you judge bout how many pounds you sold
When you come from where you judge 'bout how many hoes you fuck
If I succeed or if I fail in either one I'm fucked in my mind
Cause I got daughters and shit
And the more time I spend from them, the smarter they get
So they learn that something, shit
But I wonder who's teaching
Oh my bad shit I'm done with the preaching
Ya'll wanna hear 'bout the drugs, the money, sex and the guns
Or how I hate a hater and what I do with my tongue
Or how I'm with the faders and how my squad is the realest
Yall rather play my games, than hear 'bout my scrimmage
I dig it

[Rapsody verse]

180 pennicle, turn back
Back to blackin out on niggas rollin on Rosecran
LA LA land, A Kobe fan
Get booted I unrouted de plans
Pulled the wisdom out and now they ain't feeling advanced
Gino the first rounds, gotta um all feeling some down-
Ward spirals I'm checkin for vitals
Waves reaching tidals, I'm reaching for titles
Tribals I make marks like
Cartwright and Bill (build) off
Till the wheels off the ground and I'm flyer than the air force
Gravitate to me and hold me down like the airports
See thru the outside
Got love for my allies
Sun donâ€™t set in the same position as when the sun rise
I'm two fives intended to be the best
So never stress the lame-os
Seeing thru the camouflage
Wyclef, Lauryn, and Pras
Score ain't even I had to leave um I know its odd
For it to be this hard and still make it
I'm forever chasing feel my heart
It's still racing from the steps I took to get this far
To get this car I been dreaming bout
Gotta drive myself farther now
Like Mrs. Carter made Hova, Jehovah Witness how
Door to door I knocked building a tower that theyll watch
Never complacent come place it into a higher spot
Higher seed, jack and the bean, no rapper'll top
These are the goals if you wanna have gold in yo stock

[Problem:]
I get high,then I daze for days on end
Hope my son don't admire the stage that I'm in
But baby boy I'm on fire in the place that I'm fit
To take it, might make me complacent

[Rapsody]
Uh, shit changed and I need to face it
Finally realizing my dreams are now awaken
Move real far so my envious rate is raising
Get love now, so any heart I break I replace it with ease
