[Intro: 9th Wonder]
Check it out y’all, 9th wonder right here representing the T
At 106 Backroom we got O-Town’s finest
GQ

[Verse: GQ]
Yea, 5-1-0, [?] what up boi?
Look, I hold a conversation with the Omega for three days
I need it, somethin’ just to help me through the weekday
Instrumental replay, mind just start driftin’ on
Shoes with the pink and green line make a sister across
I’m livin’ off ten, you livin’ off your bitch
Boi, see where I’m from ain’t anybody trippin’ off the [?]
Trippin’ off the way you can’t be, no baggage claim
Still carry a lot, Mariah thank me
Think he, mediocre or bullshit you ain’t [?]
Sittin’ at a table at a meetin’ ‘tween Satan and God
Give your life just to be a fly on the wall for that
Stupid look on your face, I work hard for that
Fly when I want man [?] shoot 9th
Sleep through a red-eye, disregarded a few nights
Didn’t pay the heat bill, I’m livin’ the cool life
J hoodie [?] and some unreleased new nikes
Fashion kill, I’mma try to earn a few stipes
Anytime I’m with a broad, it’s probly one that you like
My crew nice, I told you, I fuckin’ told you
Planted sesame seeds on my street, me and Grover
Strike like poses, [?] is [?]
Lead by example, I’m the closest thing to Moses
What Lou say funny like a blood watchin’ blu-ray on bootleg
I’m Lieutenant Dan with a new leg
Killa, [?] and [?] still runnin’ hoop plays
Got a couple chicks that wanna lay me like a goose egg
Ridin’, [?], puffin’ on a [?] leg
Drinkin’ red rum, cop come, then it’s Kool-Aid
Backroom, sooner or later was gonna swing through
Probly leave here and go to [?] school
I gotta spittin’ habit, with BET can’t believe what they see
I’m big worm in a kitchen cabinet
I hate school but might go back and get my master’s
I’m just tryna be special as Nas rappin’ backwards
Lookin’ at picture taken in Tokyo
Flow like Bullethead, rest in peace Romeo
Days you ain’t care, all in my portfolio
They proud of me, but back then they ain’t pick me like Kobe fro
Now they on me like acts after a couple raps
All you want is followers and double taps, right?
Real life what I leave you, I could keep goin’ but ain’t no need to
Rated Oakland, get that
Jamla
