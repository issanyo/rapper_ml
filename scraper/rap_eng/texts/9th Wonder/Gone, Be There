What is written can be spit into light
It's a given like deliverance
My People are you listening?
(you must live your life)
Your search for the right answers
Might find you the wrong questions
And a strong lesson like....
(you know its inside)
Play your part never follow a script
Dream Huge, Be You, as small as it gets.... know
(you're big in your mind)
Speak true before it wouldve been
Should now, chould be all depends on what you put down
(in your book of rhymes)


You fall hard if you climbing a ladder
Drilling down in the ground to be God, we are....
(crazy in our time)
I felt lost till the music had found me
Astounding how didn't I see the frauds around me...
Huh...
(save me they are blind)
Sky is the limit when youre staring above you...
If you don't look around...how will you know when they shove you?....
(say we are alright)
We are alright though our living is subdued..
Earth, I am yours I love you of course baby
(lady you are mine)
