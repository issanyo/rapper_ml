[Sean Price]
P! Ha ha
Thank you thank you thank you, you're far too kind
I worked so hard to be this stupid, yes I did
Knahmean?
Hell yeah, get stupid on 'em, yo

Aiyyo fist full of dollars, dutch full of piff
Book full of rhymes and a long fo'-fifth
Listen to me, you heard me pah, listen to P
I'm a dog bitch I piss on a tree, bow wow
Now, first of all I "Ain't Nuttin Ta Fuck Wit"
Sean Price is the name and I still "Bring Da Ruckus"
Heltah Skeltah the team, Boot Camp is the Clik
Elijah, that's my son and Bernadette is my bitch
Listen to me, you heard me pah, listen to P
Broke rapper that'll spit for a G, need a verse?
I started, out broke but then I made a little change
And blew, all my money on a damn dice game
Listen to me, you heard me pah, listen to P
Assed out, aced out, threw a 1-2-3
3-2-1, Contact, me and the God back
The don Chaundon and Sean on another bomb track
Listen to me - fuck it, don't listen to P
Leave yo' ass shooken lookin like Muhammad Ali

[Hook]
Listen to me - listen to who? Listen to P
Sean Price, get it right, for the B.C.C
Listen to me - listen to who? Listen to C
Chaundon of the League, who's spittin harder than me?
Listen to me - listen to who? Listen to me
Nah P - nah C nigga, listen to me

[Chaundon]
Let's get it on, murderous verses from Chaundon
Got beats that's nothin, I got a mic to spit it on
Piff in the dutch, bitch in the cut, feelin on her butt
Pourin 190 proof in her cup
Shit is diesel, gettin brain-washed in the Regal
Still fuck with birds from the chickens to the eagles
People, listen I'm a nasty muh'fucker
Stickin dick to a broad same age as your mother
Ass grown and sexy and she goin through menopause
Can't get knocked up, come back and say it's yours
Heh, geah that was ignorant, fuck that
Blame the 190 proof it gettin me belligerent
98 degrees in the shade, still sippin it
Throwin up all in the booth and still rippin it
God damn, Chaundon and Sean P's killin it
Best of both Sean's part two, are you feelin it?

[Hook]

Listen to me - listen to who? Listen to P~! {*echoes*}
