Qawi Sales - Paint A Picture

Verse 1: Qawi Sales

They brought my ancestors over in slave ships
Now I suffer from modern day enslavement/
Its still the same shit, chain/whips, exchange death
They ain't change shit except how the change spent/
Or how the range sits
They cash, straight flip
Tryn stack money, how a crane lifts
I'm on the pac I came to bring the pain bitch/
Waiting for the next fight like a caged pitt
Tell me why do they lie about history
And tell me why do my lyrics sound heavenly/
I can paint a picture
Detective taking pictures
Wait & listen on a real nigga making figures/
Imagine the first time indians tasted liquor
Leonardo da vinci, I can paint a picture/
The first time a nigga got killed by a gun
Now a grown ass man getting killed by his son/
I don't lie about shit i'm as real as they come
Planes releasing chemicals to fill in our lungs/
What is that about?...
John Gotti was a boss how could Sammy The Bull rat him out?
The streets UFC I ain't tapping out
We on the front line of war no backing out/
Just tryn earn money by the fastest route
... its hard to leave the streets
But the same niggas helping you get payed will dig ya grave
Come to your funeral just to get a plate/
Niggas become snakes just to win a race
I'm serious bro, these hoes is Marion Jones/
Cut you off if she hit the lottery for life
Started in the hood now she Condaleeza Rice/
The people are split about
We get handed bullshit and live it out what is this shit about?
The Randy Moss's running the sickest routes?
They use us for entertainment how the fuck we getting out?
I can paint a picture
Just look out the window
And inhale the smoke from the indo
