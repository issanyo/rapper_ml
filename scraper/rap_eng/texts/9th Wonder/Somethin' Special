[First Verse]
When you're downtown or just cruising 'round
Do yourself a favor bump this sound so amazing profound
Ignore fools who just want to frown
They ain't used to fun
Too down and out for clowning around
You are your best friend and worst opponent
Surroundin' myself with constructive proponents
Why complicate life with too much components?
When it's simple (right) in the present moment
Confusion found in the past and future
Too many positions like kama sutra
Stay on lane follow your course
Don't waste my voice on remorse it will turn hoarse
It happened already why beat a dead horse?
Just flow with life mang the universal force
Peace or chaos which one to endorse?
What grows within check it that's the main source

[Second Verse]
The game getting old I bring in the new
By laying out the facts and sharing what's true
Most dudes just spread disease like the bird flu
My songs help you do just like a bird do, flying
Like it or not we all dying
You never know 'til you actually start trying
If you died today would you be satisfied?
If not then this your alarm you never really tried
That one thing you always wanted to do
You think too much about safety sucka just shoot (yeah!)
Get it done before you get the boot uh
Livin' my adventure so I got none to lose
As rough as it gets I keep it smooth
Don't get thrown off cause I do what I do
In midst of chaos when you don't know where to go
Just refer to the atlas of the soul, yo

[Third Verse]
No matter what learned or how many opened doors
Wisdom only comes from experience in the core
Folks ask me what I'm doing this for
To them I say nothing more than to share value to the more
Some say all of this is pointless
Regardless I'll gladly take the risk
Every shot not taken is a miss (swish!)
Yes on reflection but no reminisce (n'aw mean?)
If looking at the rearview then you blind to the front
Best case scenario death by trauma from the blunt (not weed)
Nothing's good or bad, it's just what it is
What's evil or special man that's your business
You see with eyes we all witness
Just depends on our area of interest
Mine's not so serious with forgiveness
Got a choice to break or build bridges right
