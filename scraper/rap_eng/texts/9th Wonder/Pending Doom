Put your hands up in the air 263
Put your hanss up in the air 263
Talk about pending doom the planet about to crumble
Talk about pending doom the planet about to crumble
Talk about pending doom the planet about to crumble
Talk about pending doom the planet about to crumble

[Verse One King Ed]
Life is a gamble
Got me feeling like Al Pacino
I'm the godfather of this industry
They're rapping about the shit that they never did
Just for the fun of it, this shit don't make sense
Me I rap about my innocence
Embarrassing moments concealed in these rhymes
They say gospel rappers haven't been making sense ever since they tasted the fruit
I'm that one preacher that uses the pen as a bible
Just to tell you about sorrows of the heart
I'm a motherfucking riffle shot a thousand niggas on site with only one word
Hope
Talk about pending doom the planet about to crumble
Nowadays its all about mumble rappers
Talking about gold chains
What happened to the humble rappers
Talking about change, about breaking outta the cage?
Talk about pending doom the planet about to crumble
Politicians giving hope in exchange for intelligence
We all residents of the same planet voting for corrupt presidents
That blame it on the innocents

Talk about pending doom the planet about to crumnle
Talk about pending doom the planet about to crumble
Talk about pending doom the planet about to crumble
Talk about pending doom the planet about to crumble
Talk about pending doom the planet about to crumble

[Verse Two King Ed]
Life is a gamble
Metaphors got me speaking gibberish
I'd break it down if I could
Dealing with depression on a daily basis
Can't remember faces that ever gave me hope
Shout out to my nigga Typical
I was thinking about retirement
Wait a minute, I never got anywhere
Talk about pending doom my life about to crumble
Could've found me choking on a rope
Then she came along, told me about her big not so happy family
Tryna give these kids hope but something's missing from the television
Revolution won't be televised
20/20 vision made me analyse
20/20 vision made me realise
The planet about to crumble
Prophet of doom sprayed it in your face
Planet about to crumble
20/20 vision made me analyse
20/20 vision made me realise
True essence of rap is gone I feel alone
