[Verse]
When I flow, it’s like +TNT for the Brain+
I +Push the Limit+ on emcees when I bring the pain
My rhymes open +The Gate+, and inside it, +The Eyes of Truth+
And in those eyes, the +Look of Today+ is corrupting the youth
It’s my +Endless Quest+ to re-enlighten Hip-Hop’s mind
There are many unsigned artists, and I’m the +Third of Its Kind+
Psych—I meant the last, the Ghost of Hip-Hop’s past
Possessed me to put mainstream artists on blast
About to +Return+ them +To+ their +Innocence+, their existence is insolence
Hip-Hop deserves Deliverance, erase all the ignorance
Planted by the mainstream, only caring about C.R.E.A.M
Like it’s only a get-rich-quick scheme for fiends
Greed is a Deadly Sin, the message is never clearer
They better take a good look at +The Screen Behind The Mirror+
These are words from the +Silent Warrior+, so take heed
Anyone who wants to hear the truth, this is what you need
Because there has to be some +Silence+ that +Must Be Heard+
From this absurd pop-hop that keeps going word-for-word
And for that, there’s just one thing I’d like to say: +Why!+
Do I have to watch the youth be corrupted by my own eye?
It’s just crazy for them to be +Knocking on Forbidden Doors+
Of their life, cause one day, their bodies will hit the floors
Or wind up in a cell, it’s like we’re living in Hell
This is more than just the truth that I’m trying to tell
