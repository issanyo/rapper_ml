[Intro x2]
I am beyond the sky, so I’m feeling pretty high
Come and tell me, “hi”. I’m on LEVEL 45

[Verse 1: SamSpacely]
It’s umm…
SamSpace recording live on LEVEL 45
No vibe is fortified like what I prescribe
How can I describe the way we arrived
At the stage that we at?
I meant to stay and never sway
Keeping my place like a mat
…but so much for that

That LEVEL 45 will have them mortified
I’m finding that there’s more to life
I feel like I’m more alive
We’re living immortals, right?
Get in the portals and travel to world’s that out of sight
Don’t need no satellite
(Nah!)
Let’s drop a jewel on the fools who be too confused
To get up and do they research
Acting as if they knees hurt
Please!
What they need is to get a life
Something that will set them right
They need to power-up on LEVEL 45

The game has just begun
Become the player one
I’m playing too
I’m player two
So you can lead the way you choose too
It ain’t no losing if failure is not an option
Tell them to stop and watch us
We dominating the monsters

No other players could ever make it this far
You and me as a team we stay elevating the bar
It ain’t no secret our team is leading the charts
The game is never on pause, yet it’s waiting for me to start

[HOOK x4]
I am beyond the sky, so I’m feeling pretty high
Come and tell me “hi”. I’m on LEVEL 45

[Verse 2: SamSpacely]
I found…
Double XP
I’d take it, but its empty
Somebody must’ve beat me to the spot
My en-emies, take shots, take rocks
Throw them at my face, stop!
How come they gotta damage me, to show they not friendly?
Damn, well either way, I’mma still survive
On Level 45 and no surprise that I’m still alive
My score is on the rise, with homicide after homicide
But when I decide it’s time to ride, I set the bombs aside
Because it’s no better time to whip out the whip
In case you did forget, you cannot kick out the kid
I’m making you regret that this is just how it is
I spit the sick-sour shit, get in the shower quick
And wash…
The coke flow from off you
You want to turn me in then go and do what the cops do
I’m not gonna stop you
I know that there is more to this
I got my eyes on the prize, LEVEL 46

[HOOK x6]
I am beyond the sky, so I’m feeling pretty high
Come and tell me “hi”. I’m on LEVEL 45
