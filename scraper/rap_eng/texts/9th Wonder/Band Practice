It goes work that body for all my niggas
5 star generals and y'all beginners
Rock on my niggas, get it on my niggas

[Verse One] [Phonte]
Mr. Get Busy
Mr. So Damn Nit Picky
Circle you squares till I get dizzy
And bum rush your whole spot
My raps slap box with robots like Sam Witwicky
I Left It All Behind now I'm taking my shit with me
Gave you a chance to shine not it's time that we gritty
And we can rhyme, go line for line, I got plenty of time
You can stay all day like Miss Milly
You rap niggas kill me
It's just to much for me
Fathered a style, then I gave up custody
Until reluctantly
My fam reminded, there's so many words that can't no nigga fuck with me
Such disgust
So many things I can dis-cuss
And lames that I can distrust
Touch, the radio sometimes to see what I might have missed
And from the sound of things, I ain't miss much
My nigga P said, "Take your time
It's like planets when they align
Hell you ain't even gotta rhyme."
Not boasting but I can coast it
Especially when niggas still tripping off the stuff we did in '99
But Tigga ain't a coward
And still my pride just can't allow it
So I'm gonna spit for the many dozens
Fans that kept a nigga hot when a nigga wasn't
And straight kept a nigga fed when a nigga struggling
Survived shut downs, break ups and Benny budgets
Surprised that I lived to tell any of it
This joint tip, but I'm anointing
So any shots this way about as pointless as titty fucking
Whoa son, you're doing it ass backwards
Tay spit fire from here to Grand Rapids
Michigan
Me and 9th, two of God's instruments
And when we get together, nigga call it band practice

"We have a band, that's all you need!"
