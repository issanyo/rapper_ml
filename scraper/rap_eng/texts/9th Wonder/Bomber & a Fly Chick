[Intro]
(Don't front, don't you know I gotcha)

[Verse 1]
I’m living the flow for ‘em
It be that nigga that's from the 'Go, for niggas that don’t know him
For all you rappers biting your tongues I hope you choke on them
I’m killin rappers, turn 'em to ghosts while niggas is [ghost?] for em
Baby, let me coach for em, I’m putting them in the game
See I’ma  sharp shooter, you better switch up your aim
I say my pockets [?] but when you make it rain
Treatin’ girls like jerseys cause they giving me numbers and names
How you goin? Nice to meet ya, yea it’s nice to know me
The girls give it to me, you would thinkin' that they owe me
One head and [?]
What’s my name, Toby? No, I’m Add-2
I'm the one like Obi, you know me
Back to the basics, better trace this
Can’t erase this, better chase this
The nigga be running the track like some Asics
Nigga, shit is a breeze, nigga I kill it with ease
[?]
Competin’ with me?
Shit, nigga please

[Hook]
Bomber and a fly chick, bomber and a fly chick
Tick, tick boom, bomber and a fly chick
All I need in this cold, cold world
Is my [?] down bubble and my down ass girl

[Verse 2]
All I need in this world
Is a good night with a bad ass girl and I’m cool
Similar to a pool in the summertime
Got me feelin’ like a ceiling, I be over their mind
Wine, I get better with time
Watch, I look better in lime
Light, see the way that we shine
Bright, them niggas is blind
And we don’t play like we ride the [?]
And my niggas be having [?]
Whatchu think, we talkin’ bout [?]?
No man, we still makin’ them classics
Never change, like blackberry molasses
More jams than traffic, no nigga can’t pass it
Roast, toast niggas without raisin’ our glasses
I know you praying on this
I’m sorry, that don’t exist
[?]
You know I be killing beginning to end
It beginning to feel like a symphony
Ripping this rapping like it was a ribbon
[?] I'm wrapping, it’s Christmas nigga

[Hook]
