I remember
I remember when
You used to like me
I used to love you
You used to hold me
I remember when
You used to trust me
I used to trust you
Now we don't even like each other anymore
What happened?
We don't even like each other anymore
What happened?
I remember

The hardest thing to do is to break your heart
Yeah, you broke mine and I forgave that part
It's like I woke up one day and I ain't love you no more
Now everything you do gets on my nerves a little bit more
I gave you everything I had, I can't give you no more
It's like there's levels to this thang and we ain't on the same floor
And now I feel like Florence, I gotta open the door
And walk thru it, I don't know when I got influenced for sure
Maybe mama gave me too much advice for me to keep going
I saw ya mama out she huggest my neck and kept on going
I know she missed me
Tell her I miss her, for sure
And imma always love you forever ex boyfriend
But I ain't in love no more
No, I don't love you no more
I donâ€™t love you no more
